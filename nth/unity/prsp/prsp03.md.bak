###  Lesson One Spiritual Substance, the Fundamental Basis of the Universe 

DIVINE MIND is the one and only reality. When we incorporate the ideas
that form this Mind into our mind and persevere in those ideas, a mighty
strength wells up within us. Then we have a foundation for the spiritual
body, the body not made with hands, eternal in the heavens. When the
spiritual body is established in consciousness, its strength and power
is transmitted to the visible body and to all the things that we touch
in the world about us.

Spiritual discernment reveals that we are now in the dawn of a new era,
that the old methods of supply and support are fast passing away, and
that new methods are waiting to be brought forth. In the coming commerce
man will not be a slave to money. Humanity's daily needs will be met in
ways that are not now thought practical. We shall serve for the joy of
serving, and prosperity will flow to us and through us in streams of
plenty. The supply and support that love and zeal will set in motion are
not as yet largely used by man, but those who have tested their
providing power are loud in their praise.

<span id="page_10">p. 10</span>

The dynamic power of the supermind in man has been sporadically
displayed by men and women of every nation. It is usually connected with
some religious rite in which mystery and priestly authority prevail. The
so-called "common herd" are kept in darkness with respect to the source
of the superhuman power of occult adepts and holy men. But we have seen
a "great light" in the discovery by physical scientists that the atom
conceals electronic energies whose mathematical arrangement determines
the character of all the fundamental elements of nature. This discovery
has disrupted the science based on the old mechanical atomic theory, but
has also given Christian metaphysicians a new understanding of the
dynamics back of Spirit.

Science now postulates space rather than matter as the source of life.
It says that the very air is alive with dynamic forces that await man's
grasp and utilization and that these invisible, omnipresent energies
possess potentialities far beyond our most exalted conception. What we
have been taught about the glories of heaven pales into insignificance
compared with the glories of the radiant rays--popularly referred to as
the "ether." We are told by science that we have utilized very meagerly
this mighty ocean of ether in producing from it the light and power of
electricity. The seemingly tremendous force generated by the whirl of
our dynamos is but a weak dribble from a universe of energy. The
invisible waves that carry radio programs everywhere are but a mere hint
of an intelligent power that penetrates

<span id="page_11">p. 11</span>

and permeates every germ of life, visible and invisible. Scientific
minds the world over have been tremendously moved by these revolutionary
discoveries, and they have not found language adequate to explain their
magnitude. Although a number of books have been written by scentists,
setting forth guardedly the far-reaching effects that will inevitably
follow man's appropriation of the easily accessible ether, none has
dared to tell the whole story. The fact is that the greatest discovery
of all ages is that of physical science that all things apparently have
their source in the invisible, intangible ether. What Jesus taught so
profoundly in symbols about the riches of the kingdom of the heavens has
now been proved true.

According to the Greek, the language in which the New Testament has come
down to us, Jesus did not use the word heaven but the word heavens in
His teaching. He was not telling us of the glories of some faraway place
called "heaven" but was revealing the properties of the "heavens" all
around us, called both "space" and "ether" by physicists. He taught not
only its dynamic but also its intelligent character, and said that the
entity that rules it is within man: "The kingdom of God is within you."
He not only described this kingdom of the heavens in numerous parables
but made its attainment by man the greatest object of human existence.
He not only set this as man's goal but attained it Himself, thereby
demonstrating that His teaching is practical as well as true.

<span id="page_12">p. 12</span>

The scientists tell us that the ether is charged with electricity,
magnetism, light rays, X rays, cosmic rays, and other dynamic
radiations; that it is the source of all life, light, heat, energy,
gravitation, attraction, repulsion; in short, that it is the
interpenetrating essence of everything that exists on the earth. In
other words, science gives to the ether all the attractions of heaven
without directly saying so. Jesus epitomized the subject when He told
His followers that it was the kingdom from which God clothed and fed all
His children. "Seek ye first his kingdom, and his righteousness; and all
these things shall be added unto you." Science says that the electrical
particles that break into light in our earth's atmosphere are also a
source of all substance and matter. Jesus said that He was the substance
and bread that came from the heavens. When will our civilization begin
really to appropriate and use this mighty ocean of substance and life
spiritually as well as physically?

This inexhaustible mind substance is available at all times and in all
places to those who have learned to lay hold of it in consciousness. The
simplest, shortest, and most direct way of doing this was explained when
Jesus said, "Whosoever ... shall not doubt in his heart, but shall
believe that what he saith cometh to pass, he shall have it." When we
know that certain potent ideas exist in the invisible mind expressions,
named by science both "ether" and "space" and that we have been provided
with the mind to lay hold of them, it is easy to put the law

<span id="page_13">p. 13</span>

into action through thought and word and deed.

"There is a tide in the affairs of men,

Which, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune," said Shakespeare. That
flood tide awaits us in the cosmic spaces, the paradise of God.

The spiritual substance from which comes all visible wealth is never
depleted. It is right with you all the time and responds to your faith
in it and your demands on it. It is not affected by our ignorant talk of
hard times, though we are affected because our thoughts and words govern
our demonstration. The unfailing resource is always ready to give. It
has no choice in the matter; it must give, for that is its nature. Pour
your living words of faith into the omnipresent substance, and you will
be prospered though all the banks in the world close their doors. Turn
the great energy of your thinking toward "plenty" ideas, and you will
have plenty regardless of what men about you are saying or doing.

God is substance, but if by this statement we mean that God is matter, a
thing of time or condition, then we should say that God is
substanceless. God is not confined to that form of substance which we
term matter. God is the intangible essence of that which man has formed
into and named matter. Matter is a mental limitation of that divine
substance whose vital and inherent character is manifest in all life
expression.

God substance may be conceived as God energy, or Spirit light, and "God
said, let there be light, and there was light." This is in harmony with
the conclusions

<span id="page_14">p. 14</span>

of some of the most advanced physicists. Sir James Jeans says, in "The
Mysterious Universe," "The tendency of modern physics is to resolve the
whole material universe into waves, and nothing but waves. These waves
are of two kinds: bottled-up waves, which we call matter, and unbottled
waves, which we call radiation, or light. The process of annihilation of
matter is merely unbottling imprisoned wave energy, and setting it free
to travel through space."

Spirit is not matter. Spirit is not person. In order to perceive the
essence of Being we must drop from our mind all thought that God is in
any way circumscribed or has any of the limitations that we associate
with things or persons having form or shape. "Thou shalt not make unto
thee a graven image, nor any likeness of any thing that is in heaven
above, or that is in the earth beneath."

God is substance, not matter, because matter is formed, while God is the
formless. God substance lies back of matter and form. It is the basis of
all form yet does not enter into any form as a finality. Substance
cannot be seen, touched, tasted, or smelled, yet it is more substantial
than matter, for it is the only substantiality in the universe. Its
nature is to "sub-stand" or "stand under" or behind matter as its
support and only reality.

Job says, "The Almighty shall be thy defence, and thou shalt have plenty
of silver." This refers to universal substance, for silver and gold are
manifestations of an everywhere present substance and

<span id="page_15">p. 15</span>

are used as symbols for it. Lew Wallace, in "Ben-Hur," refers to the
kingdom as "beaten gold." You have doubtless in your own experience
caught sight of this everywhere present substance in your silence, when
it seemed like golden snowflakes falling all about you. This was the
first manifestation from the overflow of the universal substance in your
consciousness.

Substance is first given form in the mind, and as it becomes manifest it
goes through a threefold activity. In laying hold of substance in the
mind and bringing it into manifestation, we play a most important part.
We do it according to our decree. "Thou shalt decree a thing, and it
shall be established unto thee." We are always decreeing, sometimes
consciously, often unconsciously, and with every thought and word we are
increasing or diminishing the threefold activity of substance. The
resulting manifestation conforms to our thought, "As he thinketh within
himself, so is he."

There is no scarcity of the air you breathe. There is plenty of air, all
you will ever need, but if you close your lungs and refuse to breathe,
you will not get it and may suffocate for lack of air. When you
recognize the presence of abundance of air and open your lungs to
breathe it deeply, you get a larger inspiration. This is exactly what
you should do with your mind in regard to substance. There is an
all-sufficiency of all things, just as there is an all-sufficiency of
air. The only lack is our own lack of appropriation. We must seek the
kingdom of

<span id="page_16">p. 16</span>

God and appropriate it aright before things will be added to us in
fullness.

There is a kingdom of abundance of all things, and it may be found by
those who seek it and are willing to comply with its laws. Jesus said
that it is hard for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of heaven. This
does not mean that it is hard because of his wealth, for the poor man
gets in no faster and no easier. It is not money but the thoughts men
hold about money, its source, its ownership, and its use, that keep them
out of the kingdom. Men's thoughts about money are like their thoughts
about all possessions; they believe that things coming out of the earth
are theirs to claim and control as individual property, and may be
hoarded away and depended on, regardless of how much other men may be in
need of them. The same belief is prevalent among both rich and poor, and
even if the two classes were suddenly to change places, the inequalities
of wealth would not be remedied. Only a fundamental change in the
thoughts of wealth could do that.

Before there is any fundamental social or economic change men must begin
to understand their relationship to God and to one another as common
heirs to the universal resource that is sufficient for all. They must
give up some of their erroneous ideas about their "rights." They must
learn that they cannot possess and lock up that which belongs to God
without themselves suffering the effects of that sequestration. The poor
man is not the greatest sufferer in this concentration of wealth, for he
has not

<span id="page_17">p. 17</span>

concentrated his faith in material things and chained his soul to them.
Those who are rich in the things of this world are by their dependence
on those things binding themselves to material things and are in
material darkness.

Every thought of personal possession must be dropped out of mind before
men can come into the realization of the invisible supply. They cannot
possess money, houses, or land selfishly, because they cannot possess
the universal ideas for which these symbols stand. No man can possess
any idea as his own permanently. He may possess its material symbol for
a little time on the plane of phenomena, but it is such riches that
"moth and rust consume, and where thieves break through and steal."

Men possess as valuables their education, trade, ability, or
intellectual talent. Ministers of the gospel possess scholarship or
eloquence, and take pride in these spiritual possessions. Yet even these
are burdens that must be unloaded before they may enter the kingdom of
the heavens. The saint who is puffed up with his saintly goodness must
unload his vanity before he gets in. Whoever is ambitious to do good, to
excel his fellow men in righteousness, must lose his ambition and desire
before he beholds the face of the all-providing Father.

The realm of causes may be compared to steam in a glass boiler. If the
glass is clear one may look right at it and see nothing at all. Yet when
an escape valve is touched the steam rushes out, condenses and becomes
visible. But in this process it has also

<span id="page_18">p. 18</span>

lost its power. Substance exists in a realm of ideas and is powerful
when handled by one who is familiar with its characteristics. The
ignorant open the valves of the mind and let ideas flow out into a realm
with which they have nothing in common. The powerful ideas of substance
are condensed into thoughts of time and space, which ignorance conceives
as being necessary to their fruition. Thus their power is lost, and a
weary round of seedtime and harvest is inaugurated to fulfill the
demands of the world.

It is the mind that believes in personal possessions that limits the
full idea. God's world is a world of results that sequentially follow
demands. It is in this kingdom that man finds his true home. Labor has
ceased for him who has found this inner kingdom. Divine supply is
brought forth without laborious struggle: to desire is to have
fulfillment.

This is the second step in demonstration for the one who has fully
dedicated himself to the divine guidance. He immediately enters into
easier experiences and more happiness than the world affords, when he
covenants to follow only the good. There is an advanced degree along the
same line of initiation into the mysteries of the divine. Before this
step may be taken, a deeper and more thorough mental cleansing must be
undergone. A higher set of faculties is then awakened within the body,
and new avenues of expression are opened for the powers of the Spirit,
not only in the body but also in the affairs of the individual. As he
proceeds to exercise these faculties

<span id="page_19">p. 19</span>

he may find some of them clogged by the crystals of dead thought that
some selfish ideas have deposited, which makes him go through a fresh
cleansing. If he is obedient to the Spirit and willing to follow without
cavil or protest, the way is easy for him. If however he questions and
argues, as did Job, he will meet many obstructions and his journey will
be long and tedious.

Again, he who seeks the kingdom of substance for the sake of the loaves
and fishes he may get out of it will surely be disappointed in the end.
He may get the loaves and fishes, that is quite possible; but if there
remains in his soul any desire to use them for selfish ends, the
ultimate result will be disastrous.

Many people are seeking the aid of Spirit to heal them of their physical
ills. They have no desire for the higher life, but having found their
lusts and passions curtailed by physical infirmities, they want these
erased in order that they may continue in their fleshly way. It is the
experience of all who have dealt with Spirit that it is a vigorous
bodily stimulant. It restores the vitality of the body until it is even
more sensitive to pleasure or pain than it was before the spiritual
quickening. This supersensitiveness makes it more susceptible and liable
to more rapid waste if further indulgence is gratified. That is why
those who receive spiritual treatment should be fully instructed in the
Truth of Being. They should be shown that the indulgence of bodily
passions is a sin against their success in every walk of life and
especially in the way of finances and prosperity. If substance

<span id="page_20">p. 20</span>

is dissipated, every kind of lack begins to be felt. Retribution always
follows the indulgence of appetite and passion for mere sensation. Both
sinners and saints suffer in this valley of folly. The alternative is to
dedicate yourself to the Father's business. Make a definite and detailed
covenant with the Father, lay your desires, appetites, and passions at
His feet and agree to use all your substance in the most exalted way.
Then you are seeking the kingdom, and all things else shall be added
unto you.

We want to make this substance that faith has brought to our mind
enduring and abiding, so that we do not lose it when banks fail or men
talk of "hard times." We must have in our finances a consciousness of
the permanency of the omnipresent substance as it abides in us. Some
wealthy families succeed in holding their wealth while others dissipate
it in one generation because they do not have the consciousness of
abiding substance. For many of us there is either a feast or a famine in
the matter of money and we need the abiding consciousness. There is no
reason why we should not have a continuous even flow of substance both
in income and outgo. If we have freely received we must also freely give
and keep substance going, confident in our understanding that our supply
is unlimited and that it is always right at hand in the omnipresent Mind
of God.

In this understanding we can stand "the slings and arrows of outrageous
fortune," depressions, losses, and financial failures and still see God
as

<span id="page_21">p. 21</span>

abundant substance waiting to come into manifestation. That is what Paul
meant by taking up "the whole armor of God that ye may be able to
withstand in the evil day." The substance that has in the past been
manifest in our affairs is still here. It is the same substance and it
cannot be taken away. Even though there seems to be material lack, there
is plenty of substance for all. We are standing in the very midst of it.
Like the fish we might ask, "Where is the water," when we live and move
and have our being in it. It is in the water, in the air everywhere,
abounding, glorious spiritual substance. Take that thought and hold it.
Refuse to be shaken from your spiritual stand in the very midst of God's
prosperity and plenty, and supply will begin to come forth from the
ether and plenty will become more and more manifest in your affairs.

Jesus was so charged with spiritual substance that when the woman
touched His garment the healing virtue went out from it and she was
healed. There were thousands of people in the crowd, but only the woman
who had faith in that substance got it. It was already established in
her consciousness, and she knew that her needs would be met if she could
make the contact. In this there is a lesson for us. We know that
strength is manifest everywhere, for we see it in the mechanical world.
A great locomotive starts from the depot, moving slowly at first, but
when it gains momentum it speeds down the track like a streak. Thus it
is with spiritual strength. Beginning sometimes with a very small

<span id="page_22">p. 22</span>

thought, it takes on momentum and eventually becomes a powerful idea.
Every one of us can strengthen his hold on the thought of divine
substance until it becomes a powerful idea, filling the consciousness
and manifesting itself as plenty in all our affairs.

As you lay hold of substance with your mind, make it permanent and
enduring. Realize your oneness with it. You are unified with the one
living substance, which is God, your all-sufficiency. From this
substance you were created; in it you live and move and have your being;
by it you are fed and prospered.

The spiritual substance is steadfast and immovable, enduring. It does
not fluctuate with market reports. It does not decrease in "hard times"
nor increase in "good times." It cannot be hoarded away to cause a
deficiency in supply and a higher price. It cannot be exhausted in doles
to meet the needs of privation. It is ever the same, constant, abundant,
freely circulating and available.

The spiritual substance is a living thing, not an inanimate accumulation
of bread that does not satisfy hunger nor water that fails to quench
thirst. It is living bread and living water, and he that feeds on God's
substance shall never hunger and never thirst. The substance is an
abiding thing, not a bank deposit that can be withdrawn nor a fortune
that can be lost. It is an unfailing principle that is as sure in its
workings as the laws of mathematics. Man can no more be separated from
his supply of substance than

<span id="page_23">p. 23</span>

life can be separated from its source. As God permeates the universe and
life permeates every cell of the body, so does substance flow freely
through man, free from all limit or qualification.

In the new era that is even now at its dawn we shall have a spirit of
prosperity. This principle of the universal substance will be known and
acted on, and there will be no place for lack. Supply will be more
equalized. There will not be millions of bushels of wheat stored in
musty warehouses while people go hungry. There will be no overproduction
or underconsumption or other inequalities of supply, for God's substance
will be recognized and used by all people. Men will not pile up fortunes
one day and lose them the next, for they will no longer fear the
integrity of their neighbors nor try to keep their neighbor's share from
him.

Is this an impractical utopia? The answer depends on you. Just as soon
as you individually recognize the omnipresent substance and put your
faith in it, you can look for others around you to do the same. "A
little leaven leaveneth the whole lump," and even one life that bears
witness to the truth of the prosperity law will quicken the
consciousness of the whole community.

Whoever you are and whatever your immediate need, you can demonstrate
the law. If your thoughts are confused, become still and know. Be still
and know that you are one with the substance and with the law of its
manifestation. Say with conviction:

I am strong, immovable Spirit substance.

<span id="page_24">p. 24</span>

This will open the door of your mind to an inflow of substance-filled
ideas. As they come, use them freely. Do not hesitate or doubt that they
will bring results. They are God's ideas given to you in answer to your
prayer and in order to supply your needs. They are substance,
intelligent, loving, eager to manifest themselves to meet your need.

God is the source of a mighty stream of substance, and you are a
tributary of that stream, a channel of expression. Blessing the
substance increases its flow. If your money supply is low or your purse
seems empty, take it in your hands and bless it. See it filled with the
living substance ready to become manifest. As you prepare your meals
bless the food with the thought of spiritual substance. When you dress,
bless your garments and realize that you are being constantly clothed
with God's substance. Do not center your thought on yourself, your
interests, your gains or losses, but realize the universal nature of
substance. The more conscious you become of the presence of the living
substance the more it will manifest itself for you and the richer will
be the common good of all.

Do not take anyone's word for it, but try the law for yourself. The
other fellow's realization of substance will not guarantee your supply.
You must become conscious of it for yourself. Identify yourself with
substance until you make it yours; it will change your finances, destroy
your fears, stop your worries, and you will soon begin to rejoice in the
ever-present bounty of God.

<span id="page_25">p. 25</span>

Be still and turn within to the great source. See with the eye of faith
that the whole world is filled with substance. See it falling all about
you as snowflakes of gold and silver and affirm with assurance:

Jesus Christ is now here raising me to His consciousness of the
omnipresent, all-providing God substance, and my prosperity is assured.

I have unbounded faith in the all-present spiritual substance increasing
and multiplying at my word.
