###  Lesson XI The Restoration of God's Kingdom 

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Once to every man and nation comes the moment to
decide,  
In the strife of truth with falsehood, for the good or evil  
side;  
Some great cause, God's new Messiah, offering each the  
bloom or blight,  
Parts the goats upon the left hand, and the sheep upon the  
right,  
And the choice goes by forever 'twixt that darkness and  
that light.  
--Lowell

THE PROMISE that the Garden of Eden will be restored on earth is older
than the Bible. Other bibles of other peoples far antedating the Hebrews
prophesy a time when man shall possess the earth in peace and plenty; a
time when the elements shall be subdued, disease and death eliminated,
and immortal life in the body again set up. It should be observed that
all prophecies to this end that come through mystical channels say that
this

<span id="page_123">p. 123</span>

is a state to be regained. They do not hint at evolution, as understood
in modern thought. But the students of physical science arrive through
their deductions at virtually the same conclusions concerning the
ultimate condition of humanity.

2\. They also agree that this condition of peace and happiness will be
brought about through causes originating largely with man and his acts.
In other words, its consummation will depend upon the wisdom and the
energy with which men act at certain crises in history. These prophets,
both ancient and modern, say that we are now at one of the most vital
turning points in our experience. They get at it in a variety of ways,
and they differ widely in minor points, but they are unanimous in their
conclusions that now is the time foretold by prophets of old, and
reiterated by prophets now.

3\. But it does not require a prophet's perception to discern the signs
of these times. The dissolution of the old and the birth of the new are
manifest in every walk of life. For instance, the thought that has been
held inviolate for thousands of years about the opaqueness of matter has
been shattered. The materialist and his world are no more. This,
however, is only a minor example of the astounding swiftness with which
the material sense of things has been dissolved in recent years. The
past half century has witnessed more of this than the history of all the
world records before. The past few years have accelerated this
dissolution at a tremendous pace, and a prominent scientist says that
the changes have been so many that the textbooks of nearly

<span id="page_124">p. 124</span>

every science will have to be rewritten. Yet those who are watching the
mental realm know that still greater changes are going on there. The
religious world of a few years ago does not exist today. There is but
one sect in all Christendom that stands by its creed and carries forward
its work on the old lines. All the others are shaken to their
foundations. Their creeds and dogmas are skeletons in their closets,
which they do not care to talk about.

4\. In politics and in government the same upheavals are at work. The
rights of men are no longer theories; they are about to become real
conditions in the world of affairs. So from any plane of observation
that may be chosen, we can assert with conviction that a crisis is here.
Something is happening. All along the line are evidences of the birth of
the Prince of Peace. A higher state of consciousness is bursting
full-blown upon the whole race. It is everywhere, and those who are most
open to its influx are being rewarded. The power is abroad in the earth,
and it calls to men and to nations, "Come up higher."

5\. All this presages a new state of consciousness for the whole race.
It is the beginning of the visible reign of the Christ, whose seed man
was Jesus of Nazareth. Every state of consciousness is first planted as
a seed idea by some individual. So Jesus of Nazareth planted the seed
thoughts that are now springing up in so many forms and shapes. He it
was who went into all the domains of thought and formulated ideas that
have waited for a people who could comprehend and utilize them. We are
that

<span id="page_125">p. 125</span>

people. The dawn of the millennium is in our keeping. We possess the
keys that open the gates of the New Jerusalem.

6\. It should not be assumed that this refers to any sect or class; it
refers to all the people of this great time who are open to spiritual
understanding. The keys are presented to those who come into a
perception that all is mind and that all things and conditions represent
states of consciousness, produced through the free action of the I AM in
every man and woman. This is the key that is being intrusted to many in
this great day of the Lord.

7\. But the possession of this key is not all. A key is for use. We may
know all about the way in which mind formulates states of consciousness
and all about our relation to God, but unless we have made a change in
our consciousness and realized, in a measure at least, the presence of
God in our mind, we are not using the key. Theory is one thing; practice
is another.

8\. The balanced mind no longer seeks to do evil, and the factor of evil
no longer enters into its problem; but a proper discrimination between
the enduring, permanent things of existence and the transient and
evanescent is not so common. To choose wisely in this respect requires
wisdom and spiritual perception. Those who are unconsciously building on
the shifting sands of the material world are many. They try to
perpetuate the existing state of things by calling it spiritual, and
their ideals are but little removed from the materialistic. The new
heavens and the new earth are not to lie darkened

<span id="page_126">p. 126</span>

or cumbered by any conditions that exist today. All things are to be
made new. This is the promise of all the prophets of all the ages. There
is to be no more war, nor sorrow, nor crying, nor pain, nor poverty;
hence, all conditions that cause these must be destroyed.

9\. Our ideal world must first be formed in mind on a very high plane.
We may choose to build it from the standpoint of the most transcendent
dreams of humanity's perfection. Nothing less will answer, and all
attempts to bring forth the new civilization in conformity to any lower
ideal will mean failure to the true metaphysician of the Jesus Christ
school. Jesus Christ has a distinct school. He has His ideals; they have
been sown in the minds of men, and will surely come to fruitage. He saw
a people here on earth with all the powers of the gods, but He did not
look to governments, or churches, or industrial movements to bring about
the civilization that He planned.

10\. His kingdom is now ready to be set up. The conditions are ripe for
it. It is open to all, but only those may come in who are willing to
give up for it all their ideas of earthly possessions. "Seek ye first
his kingdom, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added
unto you." This admonition still holds good, and its fulfillment is
capable of visible realization by those who are willing to accept the
conditions. But it is not to be attained in the Ananias and Sapphira
way. There can be no reservation. Every earthly link must be broken,
every mortal love crucified. This was the way by which

<span id="page_127">p. 127</span>

Jesus of Nazareth got into this kingdom, and His way is the way that we
must employ.

11\. It is not for us to quarrel with the conditions of the world, nor
to take upon ourselves the burden of righting them. That is a long,
circuitous route into the kingdom, and those who are choosing it face
many weary years of waiting. We are to accept that which is now prepared
for us. The feast is ready and the invitations are out. This is no
longer a parable, but an exact statement of that which really exists in
the very atmosphere of this planet. There is a state of consciousness
that can be attained and is being attained by men, where all things are
provided to fulfill the desires of the regenerated souls. It is not
removed to some problematical heaven, nor is it on some distant planet;
but right here in our midst are the form and the substance of the
condition promised by Jesus Christ.

12\. The day is not distant when this kingdom will have its place in the
geography of this people, and those who have chosen it will be known to
exist under laws and through means beyond the ken of the Adam man. The
way into this kingdom is through the mind, and its doors all open in
response to words.

13\. If the "kingdom of heaven," to which Jesus so often referred, is a
city with golden streets, in the skies, He could easily have located it;
but He did nothing of the kind. On the contrary, He again and again gave
illustrations to show His listeners that it is a desirable condition
which can be brought about among them by the power of Spirit. He did

<span id="page_128">p. 128</span>

not speak of it as situated anywhere in particular, or say that it could
be attained quickly. For instance, in Luke 13: "Unto what is the kingdom
of God like? and whereunto shall I liken it? It is like unto a grain of
mustard seed, which a man took, and cast into his own garden; and it
grew, and became a tree; and the birds of the heaven lodged in the
branches thereof." And again: "It is like unto leaven, which a woman
took and hid in three measures of meal, till it was all leavened."

14\. It is a great mystery how these comparisons of heaven ever came to
be construed to refer in any way to a locality in the skies. What
relation to a city with streets of gold has a mustard seed planted in
the earth and springing forth into a tree? or a little cake of yeast
fermenting a baking of bread? A remarkably strange lot of comparisons
this wise one used, if He had in mind a place where the good were to go
after death!

15\. But He never pretended to represent any such thing. His command to
His disciples fully carries out His idea of the kingdom of heaven. It
was a condition to be brought about in the affairs of men. It was to
grow from small beginnings, like the mustard seed or the yeast cake. His
disciples were sent forth to sow this seed in a definite way, by
carrying into the midst of men the signs that evidence the power of
Spirit through which the kingdom of heaven is to be established right
here on this planet. There is no basis for any other view. All the
visionary theories about a place called heaven are founded on John's
symbolical description of the New Jerusalem,

<span id="page_129">p. 129</span>

which was a picture, an imagination, of the fulfillment on earth of the
very movement inaugurated by Jesus and by Him described as having such
small beginnings. The city that John saw was among men. "Behold, the
tabernacle of God is with men, and he shall dwell with them, and they
shall be his peoples, and God himself shall be with them, and be their
God: and he shall wipe away every tear from their eyes; and death shall
be no more; neither shall there be mourning, nor crying, nor pain, any
more: the first things are passed away." This all describes what is to
take place here among us. No reference is made to its being among
angels, nor is it stated that it was established at the time that John
saw the vision. It means that heaven is to be consummated in new
conditions on earth.

16\. If the kingdom taught by Jesus is in the skies, why did He direct
His disciples to pray, "Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done, as in
heaven, so on earth"?

17\. The fact that the kingdom of heaven is at hand and "within you,"
the sense man totally ignores. He does not see beyond the range of the
three limitations of space, hence cannot cognize that which lies within
and is interlaced with phenomena on another plane. The kingdom of heaven
is not only an ideal realm in which all possibility is freely
transformed into externality, but it also has its externality, as
tangible to the higher faculties as are the aspects of nature to the
sense man. It has its working plans, and it executes them with a
fidelity and an accuracy not comprehended by the

<span id="page_130">p. 130</span>

lax methods of the lower plane. So you who have looked upon the kingdom
of heaven as a potentiality to be realized by the power of your word
should change your base and see it as it is--a real place already
formed, and waiting for you, as a bride adorned for her husband.

18\. It is here all about you; the knowledge of its presence only awaits
the opening of your interior eye, the single eye, as Jesus taught. When
you look with this eye your whole body is made full of the light that is
neither of the sun nor of the moon, but of the Father.

19\. As a disciple, it is not necessary that anyone should know all the
intricacies of the metaphysical law; he has simply to act on his
inspiration. He need only preach the kingdom of heaven as being at hand,
and it will manifest itself. Electricians do not know what electricity
is; they have merely utilized some of its laws. They have found that an
unknown principle in nature is made manifest when they observe certain
conditions. They simply make the mechanical apparatus, set it in motion,
and the invisible unknown becomes visible as light, heat, power.

20\. In the world of ideas the metaphysician has discovered that there
is a realm having potentialities whose depths he has not sounded. This
realm is to him the greatest storehouse of wisdom and of life, and he
finds that his own center of consciousness is like it. He is essentially
one with it. His thinking faculty represents the mechanical device
through which this all-Principle is made manifest. His word sets

<span id="page_131">p. 131</span>

the machinery in motion, and results follow in the realm of ideas that
parallel those in the realm of dynamics. When you know this, you have
the working plan upon which is based discipleship. Then go forth and
preach, "The kingdom of heaven is at hand." As to defining what that
kingdom is like, you must be guided by the Spirit of truth alone.

21\. The Master could not describe it to men on the sense plane except
in symbols. He said that it was like a pearl of great price, to possess
which the discoverer sold all that he had. He compared its growth in the
mind to a small seed or a little leaven. He summed it all up in the
words "The kingdom of God is within you."

22\. You cannot understand mathematics until you have studied
mathematics; neither can you understand what the kingdom of heaven is
like until you have studied that kingdom on its own spiritual plane.

23\. "Awake! thou that sleepest" in the sense mind! Rouse yourself, for
the kingdom of heaven is at hand. You are a king! Bestir yourself; the
Christ of God is born in you, and the hour of your reign is at hand!
