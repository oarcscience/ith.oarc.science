###  Lesson XIV Jesus Christ's Atonement 

THERE MAY be found, in the traditions of nearly all peoples, reference
to a time when man was in a state of consciousness very much superior to
that which he now manifests. In the Hebrew Scriptures that superior
plane is symbolically described as the Edenic state, and the departure
from that place in the divine economy is called the "fall of man." Of
late years we have been taught in the new metaphysics that there never
was a "fall of man"; that man never fell; that his creation was
spiritual, and that he is just as spiritual today as he ever was, or
ever will be. Of man as an idea in Divine Mind, this is true; but that
there is not a harmonious manifestation of that idea clearly indicates
that there has somewhere been a lapse in man's evolution.

2\. When by study of himself as "mind" and finding his place in Being
man gets away from the sense consciousness, he rises into a mental
atmosphere where he sees the relation of ideas in divine

<span id="page_162">p. 162</span>

order. This perception can be attained by anyone who will detach his
thinking ego from the world of phenomena and let his free ego float out
into the universe of causes. It has been attained by thousands in every
age, and their testimony is worthy of careful consideration.

3\. When man touches in mind this plane of causes, he sees that the
discords of humanity, in body and affairs, are the direct result of
disorder in his relation to creation. He sees that there has been,
through man's power of free thought, a most vital and far-reaching
departure from the divine idea of his being.

4\. Man cannot thwart the divine plan, but by virtue of his own creative
or formative power he can turn his part of the work in that plan of its
true course and impede the consummation of it. This has been done, and
we exist today in a state of lapse, so far as our relation to God and
the orderly movement of His idea of creation are concerned. So we have
to admit that the "fall of man" is in a measure true. When we understand
this "fall" we shall perceive more fully why certain conditions that
prevail are so incongruous in a world where a good and perfect God is
supposed to rule.

5\. Material science says that evolution is the order of nature and that
all the silent records of earth, as left by departed races, testify to a
steady rise of man from lower to higher conditions.

6\. A large number of metaphysical writers and teachers have fallen into
this line of thought and have assumed that the records of man's
evolution,

<span id="page_163">p. 163</span>

as found in archaeological and geological research, bear testimony to
his mind evolution, and that the experiences through which he has passed
are in the divine order of creation. We must accept this, reconcile it,
or expunge it.

7\. We accept the testimony, but we say that it is but the evolution of
man out of a lapse from divine order in creation, and that it is no part
of the original divine plan, any more than a fall into a muddy swamp
would be a necessary part of a journey to a beutiful city. Man is the
son of a God whose methods are harmonious in bringing forth His ideas.
Man is His idea--a self-conscious entity, having in embryo all the
faculties and powers of that from which it came forth. In following the
orderly path of its unfoldment this man idea is in conscious mental
communication with its source, and knows what to do and what not to do
in bringing forth creation. "And Jehovah God commanded the man, saying,
Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat; but of the tree of
the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day
that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die."

8\. The Garden of Eden or Paradise of God is in the ether, and we see
that the "fall of man" antedated the formation of this planet as we
behold it geologically. Jesus recognized this when He said: "And now,
Father, glorify thou me with thine own self with the glory which I had
with thee before the world was."

9\. We are by birth a spiritual race, and we should never have known
matter of material conditions if

<span id="page_164">p. 164</span>

we had followed the leadings of our higher consciousness.

10\. It is the recognition of this higher consciousness and the
reorganization of our place in Being that we are seeking. We are
emerging from the darkness of Egyptian bondage--we see the Promised
Land, and we want to know the shortest way to it. That way is the Jesus
Christ way. The demonstration of Jesus relates Him to us in a
metaphysical sense, because it is only by a study of states of
consciousness formed by thought that it can be understood.

11\. We have been taught by the church that Jesus died for us--as an
atonement for our sins. By human sense this belief has been materialized
into a flesh-and-blood process, in which the death of the body on the
cross played the important port. Herein has the sense consciousness led
the church astray. That spiritual things must be spiritually discerned
seems to have escaped the notice of the church in forming its scheme of
atonement. At the root of the church's teaching is Truth; Jesus of
Nazareth played an important part in opening the way for every one of us
into the Father's kingdom. However, that way was not through His death
on the cross, but through His overcoming death. "I am the resurrection,
and the life."

12\. To comprehend the atonement requires a deeper insight into creative
processes than the average man and the average woman have attained; not
because they lack the ability to understand, but because they have
submerged their thinking power in a grosser thought stratum. So only
those who

<span id="page_165">p. 165</span>

study Being from the standpoint of pure mind can ever understand the
atonement and the part that Jesus played in opening the way for humanity
into the glory that was potentially theirs before the world was formed.

13\. We who have studied these creative processes through thought action
know how states of consciousness are formed and how persistent a certain
mental state is after it has once crystallized. The man ego seems to
lose its identity in its own formations, and forgets for the time all
its past experiences and powers. We see this in certain social states
among the people. No matter how miserable and degraded their state,
people get so accustomed to it that they do not aspire to anything
higher. Reformers of the criminal classes in our large cities tell us
that their most difficult problem is to awaken in these people a desire
for better things. They are attached to their habits of thought and
living, and they do not want to be reformed. The same is true in the
history of efforts to civilize the savage races. Just when they are
about to reach the place where they will see the desirability of a
better way of living, they suddenly fall back into the old life, and are
satisfied. The tendency of thought emanation is to crystallize about the
form that it has made and, in spite of the struggles of the man ego, to
hold to it.

14\. We can readily see how a whole race might be caught in the meshes
of its own thought emanations and, through this drowsy ignorance of the
man ego, remain there throughout eternity, unless a break were made in
the structure and the light of a higher

<span id="page_166">p. 166</span>

way let in. This is exactly what has happened to our race. In our
journey back to the Father's house we became lost in our own thought
emanations, and Jesus Christ broke through the crystallized thought
strata and opened the way for all those who will follow Him.

15\. By so doing He made a connection between our state of consciousness
and the more interior one of the Father--He united them--made them a
unit--one, hence the at-one-ment or atonement through Him. He became the
way by which all who accept Him may "pass over" to the new
consciousness. That which died upon the cross was the consciousness of
all mortal beliefs that hold us in bondage--such as sin, evil, sickness,
fleshly lusts, and death--which He overcame. "I have overcome the
world." Jesus, "overcoming" made a great rent in the sense
consciousness, and opened a way by which all who desire may demonstrate
easily and quickly.

16\. But in order to receive the benefit of Jesus' work it is necessary
for everyone to go to the place where He made the rent in the race
beliefs. If you were held in the meshes of a great spider web, and
someone made a hole through which you could pass, you would go where the
hole was and would pass out that way. The same rule holds good of this
breach that Jesus made in the limitations of sense that hold the race in
bondage--we have to go where He is, mentally and spiritually. "I go to
prepare a place for you." So we see that the church is not so far wrong
in its call to "follow Jesus." The error lies in the belief that He was
the only begotten Son of God,

<span id="page_167">p. 167</span>

and that He overcame for us, and that by simply believing on Him we are
saved.

17\. In believing Him to be the only begotten Son of God, we have
confounded His higher consciousness or Christ consciousness, which is
the only begotten Son of God, with His lower or Jesus consciousness. He
recognized His identity in God as the Christ, the Son of God; He also
recognized His consciousness of self, the son of man. So each of us is a
son of God. We shall come into conscious recognition of the Christ mind,
effecting the junction between our mind and God's mind just as soon as
we let go of the limitations of mortal sense. God has but one Son, the
Christ, the one ideal man. This divine conjunction was accomplished by
Jesus, and the Christ shone out through His mortal self and illumined
it, until it lost its personality and disappeared into divine
individuality.

18\. By believing that Jesus was more divine than other men, the church
has assumed that He had certain privileges that the Father does not
extend to all; that in a superhuman way He made good all our
shortcomings; that we are saved from suffering for our acts by simply
believing on Him and accepting Him, in a perfunctory way, as our
Saviour. Paul is responsible for a good share of this throwing of the
whole burden upon the blood of Jesus--doubtless the result of an old
mental tendency carried over from his Hebrew idea of the blood
sacrifices of the priesthood. In order to show the parallel in the life
of Jesus, Paul preached to the Jews that He was the great once-for-all
blood sacrifice and that no other

<span id="page_168">p. 168</span>

blood sacrifice would ever become necessary.

19\. But Jesus went further than this. He said: "Come, follow me." "Keep
my sayings." He meant: Do as I do. I have overcome; now by following in
my footsteps you shall overcome.

20\. We all recognize the advantage of thought co-operation. It is much
easier to hold ourselves in the true consciousness when we are
associated with those who think as we do. It was the work of Jesus to
establish in our race consciousness a spiritual center with which
everyone might become associated mentally, regardless of geographical
location. He said to His disciples, "I go to prepare a place for you. .
. . that where I am, there ye may be also." That place is a state of
consciousness right here in our midst, and we can at any time connect
ourselves with it by centering our mind on Jesus and silently asking His
help in our demonstrations. It is not the prayer of a "worm of the dust"
to a god, but of one who is on the way asking the guidance of one who
has passed over the same road, and who knows all the hard places and how
to get through them.

21\. This in one sense is the relation of Jesus to each of us, and so
far as our present demonstration is concerned, it is the most important
relation. The road that we are traveling from the mortal plane of
consciousness to the spiritual plane is beset with many obstructions,
and we need the assistance of one stronger than any of those who now
dwell in flesh bodies. He who is still in the perception of the earthly
is not always a safe guide, because he sees in a limited way. We want
one who sees

<span id="page_169">p. 169</span>

wholly in Spirit, and such a one we find in Jesus Christ.

22\. He has not left us or gone to some faraway heaven, but He may be
reached by the humblest of us in a moment's time, if we really aspire in
soul for His companionship and help.

23\. This is a simple statement of the relation that Jesus of Nazareth
bears to us. Yet He was more than Jesus of Nazareth, more than any other
man who ever lived on the earth. He was more than man, as we understand
the appellation in its everyday use, because there came into His manhood
a factor to which most men are strangers. This factor was the Christ
consciousness. The unfoldment of this consciousness by Jesus made Him
God incarnate, because Christ is the mind of God individualized, and
whoever so loses his personality as to be swallowed up in God becomes
Christ Jesus, or God man.

24\. We cannot separate Jesus Christ from God, or tell where man leaves
off and God begins in Him. To say that Jesus Christ was a man as we are
men is not true, because He had dropped that personal consciousness by
which we separate ourselves into men and women. He was consciously one
with the absolute principle of Being. He had no consciousness separate
from that Being, He was that Being to all intents and purposes.

25\. Yet He attained no more than is expected of every one of us. "That
they may be one, even as we are" was His prayer.

26\. It is all accomplished through the externalization of the Christ
consciousness, which is omnipresent

<span id="page_170">p. 170</span>

and ever ready to manifest itself through us as it did through Jesus.

27\. This principle has been perceived by the spiritually wise in every
age, but they have not known how to externalize it and to make it an
abiding state of consciousness. Jesus accomplished this and His method
is worthy of our adoption, because, so far as we know, it is the only
method that has been successful. It is set forth in the New Testament
and whoever adopts the life of purity and love and power there
exemplified in the experiences of Jesus of Nazareth will in due course
attain the place that He attained.

28\. The way to do this is the way Jesus did it. He acknowledged Himself
to be the Son of God. The attainment of the Christ consciousness calls
for nothing less on our part than a definite recognition of ourselves as
sons of God right here and now, regardless of appearances to the
contrary. We know that we are sons of God--then why not acknowledge it
and proceed to take possession of our God right? That is what Jesus did
in the face of most adverse conditions. Conditions today are not so
stolidly material as they were in Jesus' time. People now know more
about themselves and their relation to God. They are familiar with
thought processes and how an idea held in mind will make itself manifest
in the body and in affairs; hence they take up this problem of spiritual
realization under favorable conditions. It must work out just as surely
as a mathematical problem, because it is under immutable law. The
factors are all in our possession and the

<span id="page_171">p. 171</span>

rule that was demonstrated in one striking instance is before us. By
following that rule and doing day by day the work that comes to us, we
shall surely put on Christ as fully and completely as did Jesus of
Nazareth.

29\. The process of Jesus' evolving from sense to soul was first a
recognition of His spiritual selfhood and a constant affirmation of its
supremacy and power. Jesus loved to make the highest statements: "I and
the Father are one." "All authority hath been given unto me in heaven
and on earth." He made these statements before the resurrection, so we
know that He was not fully conscious of their reality. But by the power
of His word He brought about the realization.

30\. Next in the process was that constant cleansing of the
consciousness through denial, or fasting. He prayed much alone, and
fasted. He was being tempted on every side, within and without, and was
always overcoming. He daily put out of His mind all the ideas that bind
men to the world. He recognized that the kingdom of the spiritual man is
not of this world--that it is a world that transcends this and controls
it; therefore He was not attached in any way to the things of sense.
Personal self, the Devil, told Him to turn stones into bread, but He did
not yield to this temptation to use His God-given power for material
gain. Personal sense took Him upon ambition's high place and showed Him
what He might have in the fame of the world if He would worship personal
sense, but He refused to lower His standard. He was using spiritual
power

<span id="page_172">p. 172</span>

and He was true to its character; He did not mix it with matter or with
material ways.

31\. When Jesus said, "The words that I have spoken unto you are spirit,
and are life," He touched the inner Christ word which created all
things, and we know that His words were vivified from that center with a
life essence and moving power that will demonstrate the truth of His
statement.

32\. These words have rung through the souls of men and set them afire
with God's Spirit, throughout the ages. This is because they are
spiritual words. Within them are the seeds of a divine life and they
grow in the minds of all who give them place, just as a beautiful flower
or a great tree grows from the seed germ planted in the ground.

33\. Jesus recognized that the consciousness of man was submerged in the
things of sense; that it could not perceive Truth in the abstract, and
that it must, under these conditions, be stirred into activity by some
stimulating force dropped into it from without. Hence He sent forth His
powerful words of Truth to the thirsty souls, and said to them, "Keep my
saying."

34\. To keep a saying is to revolve it in mind--to go over it in all its
aspects, to believe it as a truth, to treasure it as a saving balm in
time of need, and above all to obey the law that it sets forth.

35\. People in all ages have known about the saving power of words and
have used them to the best of their understanding. The Hebrews bound
upon their foreheads and wrists parchments with words of Scripture
written upon them. The Hindus,

<span id="page_173">p. 173</span>

Japanese, Chinese, and the people of nearly all other known nations have
their various ways of applying the sacred words to the modification of
their ills, and the invocation of the invisible powers to aid them in
both their material and spiritual needs.

36\. Although these methods are faulty in that they use the letter of
the word, instead of its spirit, they are useful to us as indicators of
the universal belief in the power of the sacred word.

37\. We know that words express ideas, and to get at their substantial
part we must move into the realm of ideas. Ideas are in the mind and we
must go there if we want to get the force of our words. The Hebrews'
phylacteries and the lamas' prayer wheels are suggestive of the wordy
prayers of the Christian; but their use is not keeping the sayings of
Jesus, nor reaping the inner substance of the mystical word. This can be
done only by those who believe in the omnipresent Spirit of God and in
faith keep in mind the words that express His goodness, wisdom, and
power.

38\. Jesus more fully voiced this nearness of God to man than any of the
prophets, and His words are correspondingly vivified with inner fire and
life. He said that those who kept His sayings should even escape death,
so potent was the life energy attached to them.

39\. This is a startling promise, but when we understand that it was not
the personal man, Jesus, making it, but the Father speaking through Him,
we know that it was not an idle one; for He said, speaking to His
disciples, "The word which ye hear

<span id="page_174">p. 174</span>

is not mine, but the Father's who sent me."

40\. This is the reason why these words of Jesus endure, and why more
and more they are attracting the attention of men.

41\. Whoever takes these words into his mind should consecrate himself
to the truth that they represent. That truth is not the doctrine of any
church, nor the creed of any sect--not even Christianity. That truth is
written in the inner sanctuary of every soul, and all know it without
external formulas. It is the intuitive perception of what is right in
the sight of God. It is the truth and justice that every man recognizes
as the foundation of true living.

42\. Whoever consecrates himself to follow this inner monitor and live
up to its promptings, regardless of social or commercial customs,
consecrates himself to do God's will. He is fitted to take the words of
Jesus and make them his own.

43\. It is no idle experiment, this keeping in the mind the words of
Jesus. It is a very momentous undertaking, and may mark the most
important period in the life of an individual. There must be sincerity
and earnestness and right motive, and withal a determination to
understand the spiritual import.

44\. This requires attention, time, and patience in the application of
the mind to solving the deeper meanings of the sayings that we are urged
to keep.

45\. People deal with sacred words in a way that is too superficial to
bring results. They juggle with words. They toss them into the air with
a heavenly tone or an oratorical ring and count it as compliance

<span id="page_175">p. 175</span>

with divine requirements. This is but another form of the prayer wheel
and the phylactery. It is the lip service that Jesus condemned because
its object is to be "seen of men."

46\. To keep the sayings of Jesus means much more than this. It has
peculiar significance for the inner life. Only after the inner life is
awakened is the true sense of the spiritual word understood. But the
sincere keeper of Jesus' sayings will by his devotions awaken the inner
spirit, and the Lord will come to him and minister to his call, as
lovingly as a father to a beloved son.

47\. Jesus tells us that His words are Spirit, and then tells us to keep
them. How can one keep a thing of which he knows nothing? How can one
keep the words and sayings of Jesus unless he gets them into his
consciousness and grasps them with his mind, his spirit?

48\. Surely there is no other way to keep His sayings. Those who are
doing so from any other standpoint are missing the mark. They may be
honest, and they may be good, sincere people, living what the world
calls pure Christian lives, but they will not get the fruits of Jesus'
words unless they comply with His requirements.

49\. Unless you perceive that there is something more in the doctrine of
Jesus than keeping up a worldly moral standard as preparation for
salvation after death, you will fall far short of being a real
Christian.

50\. Jesus did not depreciate moral living, but neither did He promise
that it fulfilled the law of

<span id="page_176">p. 176</span>

God. Very negative people are frequently trusty and moral. But that does
not make them Christians after the Jesus Christ plan. His Christianity
had a living God in it--a God that lived in Him and spoke through Him.
It was a religion of fire and water--life as well as purity. Men are to
be alive--not merely exist half dead for a few years and then go out
with a splutter, like a tallow dip. Jesus Christ's men are to be
electric lights that glow with a perpetual current from the one
omnipresent Energy. The connection with that current is to be made
through the mind by setting up sympathetic vibrations.

51\. The mind moves upon ideas; ideas are made visible through words.
Hence holding right words in the mind will set the mind going at a rate
proportioned to the dynamic power of the idea back of those words. A
word with a lazy idea back of it will not stimulate the mind. The word
must represent swift, strong, spiritual ideas in order to infuse the
white energy of God into the mind. This is the kind of word in which
Jesus reveled. He delighted in making great and mighty claims for His
God, Himself, His words, and for all men: "I and the Father are one."
"All authority hath been given unto me in heaven and on earth." "The
Father is greater than I." "Is it not written in your law, I said, Ye
are gods?" "The works that I do shall ye do also; and greater." These
were some of the claims with which He stimulated His mind. And He
produced the results--His words were fulfilled.

52\. Many who for years have been students of

<span id="page_177">p. 177</span>

the science of Christ and have a clear, intelligent perception of its
truths are yet outside the kingdom of Spirit. They anxiously ask: "Why
do I not realize the presence of Spirit?"

53\. Have you kept the sayings of Jesus? Have you said to yourself in
silence and aloud until the very ethers vibrated with its truth, "I and
the Father are one"?

54\. Have you opened the pores of your mind, by mentally repeating the
one solvent of crystallized conditions, "I in them, and thou in me"?

55\. This means mental discipline day after day and night after night,
until the inertia of the mind is overcome and the way is opened for the
descent of Spirit.

56\. The personal consciousness is like a house with all the doors and
windows barred. The doors and the windows of the mind are concrete
ideas, and they swing open when the right word is spoken to them. Jesus
voiced a whole volume of right words. If you will take up His sayings
and make them yours, they will open all the doors of your mind, the
light will come in, and you will in due time be able to step forth.

57\. Another cannot do this for you. You really do not want him to do
it, though you may think it would be nice if some master of spiritual
ideas would help you to his understanding.

58\. But this is a childish dream of the moment. You want to be
yourself, and you can be yourself only by living your own life and
finding its issues at the Fountainhead. If it were possible for one to

<span id="page_178">p. 178</span>

reveal Truth to another, we should find heaven cornered by cunning
manipulators of mind and its glories stored up in warehouses awaiting a
higher market.

59\. Let us be thankful that God is no respecter of persons, that Truth
cannot be revealed by one mortal to another. God is a special, personal
Father to every one of His children, and from no other source can they
get Truth.

60\. Jesus, who has clearly revealed the Father in His consciousness,
may tell all men how it came about. He may point the way. He may say, "I
am the way, and the truth, and the life," but there is always a
condition attached to its realization: One must exercise faith, keep His
sayings, and follow Him. Summed up, it means that by adopting His
methods one will find the same place in the Father that He found.

61\. "If a man love me, he will keep my word: and my Father will love
him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him."
