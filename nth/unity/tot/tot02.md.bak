###  Lesson I Reform Your God Thought 

THIS IS distinctly the age of reforms. Never before have there been such
widespread and persistent efforts by both men and women to right the
wrongs of religion, society, and politics.

2\. From the hearts and the souls of millions goes up the cry, "Set us
free from our burdens!" Every imaginable scheme of release is proposed,
and each advocate of a panacea for the people's ills stoutly affirms his
to be the only remedy that has virtue. It is observed that the majority
of these reformers are clamorous that laws be enacted to force their
theories upon the people. In this they are following the same methods to
cure the ills of the body politic that they have followed in curing the
body physical, and the results will surely be of like impotency.

3\. Laws, whether natural or artificial, are but the evidence of an
unseen power. They are simply effects, and effects have no power in
themselves.

<span id="page_8">p. 8</span>

When man looks to them for help in any condition of inharmony, he is
departing from a universally recognized principle of sequence. God,
Spirit or Mind--whatever you choose to name it--is the supreme dictator,
and thought is its only mode of manifestation. Mind generates thought
perpetually; all the harmonious and permanent affairs of men, and the
innumerable systems of the infinite cosmos, are moved in majestic
measures by its steady flow.

4\. All power has its birth in the silence. There is no exception to
this rule in all the evidence of life. Noise is the dying vibration of a
spent force. All the clatter of visibility, from the harangue of the
ward politician to the thunder's roar, is but evidence of exhausted
power. As well try to control the lightning's flash by wrapping the
thunder about it, as attempt to regulate mind by statutory enactments.

5\. All reforms must begin with their cause. Their cause is mind, and
mind does all its work in the realm of silence, which in reality is the
only realm where sound and power go hand in hand. The visible outer
world, with all its social, religious, and political laws, customs, and
ceremonies, is but the flimsy screen upon which mind throws its
incongruous opinions. God's thought is love, the inherent potentiality
of the God man, which knows neither persons nor things, mine nor thine,
but a universal brotherhood in which perfect equity and justice reign in
joint supremacy. All philosophers and sages have recognized this silent
cause, this perpetual outflow from center to circumference.

<span id="page_9">p. 9</span>

Emerson says of Plato: "He was born to behold the self-evolving power of
Spirit, endless generator of new ends; a power which is the key at once
to the centrality and the evanescence of things." Jesus Christ said:
"The kingdom of God is within you." "Seek ye first his kingdom, and his
righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you." Elijah
found God, not in the whirlwind, or the earthquake, or the fire, but in
the "still small voice."

6\. All men who have moved the world to better things have received
their inspiration from the Spirit within and have always looked to it
for instruction. God is not a person who has set creation in motion and
gone away and left it to run down like a clock. God is Spirit, infinite
Mind, the immanent force and intelligence everywhere manifest in nature.
God is the silent voice that speaks into visibility all the life there
is. This power builds with hands deft beyond the comprehension of man
and keeps going, with all its intricate machinery, universe upon
universe, one within another, yet never conflicting. All its building is
from center to circumference. The evidence for this runs from the
molecule and the atom of the physicist to the mighty swing of a universe
of planets around their central sun.

7\. Every act of man has its origin in thought, which is expressed into
the phenomenal world from a mental center that is but a point of
radiation for an energy that lies back of it. That point of radiation is
the conscious I, which in its correct relation is one with Cause, and
has at its command

<span id="page_10">p. 10</span>

all the powers potential in Cause. The conscious I can look in two
directions--to the outer world where the thoughts that rise within it
give sensation and feeling, which ultimate in a moving panorama of
visibility; or to the world within, whence all its life, power, and
intelligence are derived. When the I looks wholly within, it loses all
sense of the external; it is then as the Hindu yogi sitting under his
banyan tree with his eyes riveted on the point of his nose, denying his
very existence until his body is paralyzed. When it looks wholly
without, upon sensation and feeling, it loses its bearings in the maze
of its own thought creations. Then it builds up a belief of separateness
from, and independence of, a causing power. Man sees only form, and
makes his God a personal being located in a city of dimensions. This
belief of separateness leads to ignorance, because all intelligence is
derived from the one Divine Mind, and when the soul thinks itself
something alone, it cuts itself off in consciousness from the fount of
inspiration. Believing himself separate from his source, man loses sight
of the divine harmony. He is like a musical note standing alone, looking
upon other notes but having no definite place upon the great staff of
nature, the grand symphony of life.

8\. Life is a problem solvable by a principle whose essence is
intelligence, which the wise man always consults. The ignorant and
headstrong trusts to his intellect alone to carry him through, and he is
always in a labyrinth of errors.

9\. A belief prevails that God is somewhat inaccessible;

<span id="page_11">p. 11</span>

that He can be approached only through certain religious ordinances;
that is, a man must profess religion, pray in a formal way, and attend
church in order to know God. But these are mere opinions that have been
taught and accepted by those who perceive the letter instead of the
spirit. For if God is Spirit, the principle of intelligence and life,
everywhere present at all times, He must be just as accessible as a
principle of mathematics and fully as free from formalism. When a
mathematician finds that his answer to a problem is not correct, he
consults the principle and works out the correct solution. He knows that
all mathematical problems inhere in mathematical principles and that
only through them can they be worked correctly. If he persistently
ignored principles and blundered around in a jungle of experiments, he
would be attempting to get up "some other way," and he would prove
himself a "thief and a robber," for there is but one way. Jehovah God,
infinite Mind in expression, is the way, and this Mind is always within
reach of every man, woman, and child.

10\. It is not necessary to go in state to God. If you had a friend at
your elbow at all times who could answer your every question and who
loved to serve you, you certainly would not feel it necessary to go down
on your knees to him or ask a favor with fear and trembling.

11\. God is your higher self and is in constant waiting upon you. He
loves to serve, and will attend faithfully to the most minute details of
your daily life. If you are a man of the world, ask Him

<span id="page_12">p. 12</span>

to help you to success in any line that you may choose, and He will show
you what true success is. Use Him every hour of the day. If you are in
doubt about a business move, no matter how trivial, close your eyes for
an instant and ask the silent one within yourself what to do, just as
you would send a mental message to one whom you know and who could catch
your thought. The answer may not come instantly; it may come when you
least think of it, and you will find yourself moved to do just the right
thing. Never be formal with God. He cares no more for forms and
ceremonies than do the principles of mathematics for fine figures or
elaborate blackboards.

12\. You cannot use God too often. He loves to be used, and the more you
use Him the more easily you use Him and the more pleasant His help
becomes. If you want a dress, a car, a house, or if you are thinking of
driving a sharp bargain with your neighbor, going on a journey, giving a
friend a present, running for office, or reforming a nation, ask God for
guidance, in a moment of silent soul desire.

13\. Nothing is too wicked or unholy to ask God about. In my early
experience in the study of Christian metaphysics, I was told that
through the power of Divine Mind I could have anything I desired. I had
a lot I wanted to sell and I asked God to dispose of it to a certain man
who I thought needed it. That night I dreamed that I was a bandit
holding up my customer. The dream showed me that I was asking God to do
what was not right and I thereby gained a lesson. A saloonkeeper came

<span id="page_13">p. 13</span>

to me for health treatments and was helped. He said: "I also need
treatments for prosperity, but of course you could not prosper a man in
my business." I replied: "Certainly. God will help you to prosper. 'If
ye shall ask anything of the Father, he will give it you in my name'
does not exclude saloonkeepers." So we treated the man for prosperity.
He afterward reported that he was out of the saloon business, and had
found prosperity in other lines of work.

14\. If you are doing things that are considered wicked, you will find
swift safety in asking God first, then acting or refraining, as you are
moved. Some people act as if they thought that they could hide
themselves from the one omnipresent intelligence, but this is the
conclusion of thoughtlessness. God knows everything you do, and you
might just as well have His advice. God does not want you to reverence
Him with fear. God certainly never can get your confidence if you
constantly stand in quaking fear of Him. He will do you a favor just as
quickly if you ask in a jolly, laughing way as He would if you made your
request in a long, melancholy prayer. God is natural, and He loves the
freedom of the little child. When you find yourself in His kingdom it
will be "as a little child."

15\. God's kingdom of love and unity is now being set up in the earth.
His hand will guide the only ship that will ever sail into the Arcadian
port, and the contented, peaceful, and happy people that throng its
decks will sing with one voice: "Glory to God in the highest."
