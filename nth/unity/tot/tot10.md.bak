THE PURE doctrine of Jesus Christ has never been popular with those who
like formality and rites in religion.

2\. The disciples of Jesus were from the ranks of the common people,
unlearned in the lore of the scribes and without reputation, religiously
or otherwise. They, in their turn, became filled with the Holy Spirit,
and did unusual works in healing and teaching, yet their converts were
not largely from orthodox circles. It was the "common people" who gladly
heard them and their Master. The aristocracy and the organized church
opposed them at every turn. They were stoned, quartered, and burned, and
their doctrines never became the popular religion. Pure Christianity was
literally killed in less than three hundred years after the Crucifixion.
What is called Christianity is a combination of paganism,

<span id="page_102">p. 102</span>

Israelitism, and the letter of Jesus' doctrine without the spirit.

3\. This heterogeneous mass became acceptable because it was sanctioned
by kings and enforced as the church of the state. As it had a little
from all the religions, it offered balm to the forced worshipers from
each sect, and thus quickly became popular. It is not the doctrine of
Jesus Christ, however, and never has been, in any of its many forms and
sects. Here and there a gleam of Truth has come to spiritually awakened
devotees, and they have broken away from the institution and formed
newer and higher standards of Truth; but all have been far short of the
original doctrine set forth by Jesus and His disciples.

4\. Jesus never organized a church on earth, nor did He authorize anyone
else to do so. He said to Peter, "Upon this rock I will build my
church." He did not tell Peter that He was to be the head of the church,
with a line of popes to follow. He said, "I will build my church"
(ecclesia, assembly, or called-out ones). Jesus Christ is still the head
of His "assembly," and its only organization is in Spirit. Whoever
attempts to organize it on earth, with creeds, tenets, or textbooks of
any kind or description as authority, is in direct opposition to His
word and His example. He gave but one guide, one source from which His
followers should receive their inspiration: "The Holy Spirit, whom the
Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring to
your remembrance all that I said unto you."

<span id="page_103">p. 103</span>

5\. The puerile claim that this promise was for His immediate disciples
only is hardly worth considering, because of so many texts in which He
plainly states that His ministry and words are for the world. He further
said, "He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that
loveth me: and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father, and I will
love him, and will manifest myself unto him."

6\. It was this same Spirit of truth in Peter that perceived the Christ,
and of which He said, "Flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee,
but my Father who is in heaven." This revealment of Truth direct from
Spirit is the rock upon which the one and only church of Jesus Christ is
built. All other authorities are spurious.

7\. That the one and only true Church of Christ is without authority or
head on earth is evident from the accepted words of Jesus Himself. He
never authorized the history of His life as recorded in the Gospels, so
far as known; yet, accepting them as such history, on their face they
bear out the claim of a spiritual church, with only the Holy Ghost as
mediator between man and God. It is evident that Jesus saw the tendency
among men to make idols of the Scriptures, and it was His aim to do away
with that sort of idolatry. Instead of a command to "search the
scriptures," as given in the Authorized Version, the American Standard
Version tells us that Jesus reprimanded the Pharisees (John 5:39) in
these words: "Ye search the scriptures, because ye think that in them ye
have eternal life; and these

<span id="page_104">p. 104</span>

are they which bear witness of me; and ye will not come to me, that ye
may have life."

8\. It is the eternal binding of the thoughts to some external authority
in book, creed, or tradition that keeps men in bondage to the lower
world. When the mind is perfectly free to search out the higher truths
of existence, there flow into the consciousness a vigor and a virility
that set in motion all the crystallized thoughts, and fresh life stirs
the whole man. Instead of confining the infinite God in the little being
of parts and passions conceived by some good but ignorant church father
of bygone ages, the open mind flows forth in its own native freedom, and
its God is a whole universe, larger in every way than was his of the
limited concept. So it is with all the questions of doctrine that form
the stock in trade of hereditary religion. What our forefathers
discussed for a lifetime, fought bitter battles over and left undecided,
the free-minded man sees through in a moment's consideration. He sees
through it with unerring accuracy, because his point of view is far
removed from the narrow bigotry engrafted by creeds and dogmas into the
susceptible mind of the infant churchman.

9\. The mind of man is like a clear stream that flows from some lofty
mountain. It has nothing at its point of origin to corrupt or to distort
it, but as it flows out into the plain of experience, it meets the
obstruction of doubt and fear. It is here that dams are built and its
course is turned in many ways.

10\. Whoever formulates a creed or writes a book, claiming it to be an
infallible guide for mankind;

<span id="page_105">p. 105</span>

whoever organizes a church in which it is attempted, by rules and
tenets, to save men from their evil ways; whoever attempts to offer, in
any way, a substitute for the one omnipresent Spirit of God dwelling in
each of us, is an obstructor of the soul's progress.

11\. But those very things are the first attempted by the mind that is
not in constant openness to the influx from the Father. Man is by nature
an organizer. It is his function in the God-head to formulate the
potentialities of Principle. It is through man's conscious ego that the
Father makes Himself manifest to him as infinite externality. The within
and the without are one only when man recognizes that he draws all his
life, his substance, and his intelligence from infinite Spirit welling
up within him.

12\. Many have caught sight of the fact that the true church of Christ
is a state of consciousness in man, but few have gone so far in the
realization as to know that in the very body of each man and woman is a
temple in which the Christ holds religious services at all times: "Ye
are a temple of God." The appellation was not symbolical, but a
statement of architectural truth. Under the direction of the Christ, a
new body is constructed by the thinking faculty in man; the materials
entering into this superior structure are the spiritualized organic
substances, and the new creation is the temple or body of Spirit. It
breathes an atmosphere and is thrilled with a life energy more real than
that of the external form. When one who has come into the church of
Christ feels the stirring within him of this body of

<span id="page_106">p. 106</span>

the Spirit, he knows what Paul meant when he said, "There is a natural
body, there is also a spiritual body."

13\. Most of the opposition to the church of Christ comes from those who
have never felt within them the stirring of this spiritual body, who
refuse to believe the experiences of those who have. They live in the
intellectual-spiritual, and when the Holy Spirit proceeds to organize an
abiding place within them, they refuse Him recognition and call Him
"mortal mind," "the Devil," or "an unclean spirit."

14\. It is this blasphemy against the Holy Ghost that Jesus said could
not be forgiven. Everything that a man does or has done, the Father
freely forgives except the cursing of His Holy Spirit by calling it an
unclean spirit. He who understands the law of mental action can easily
see why this cannot be forgiven. Mind organizes its states of
consciousness according to methods inherent in Being. First is the idea,
the center in which the form is generated. This form is projected from
that center to a circumference, and in its line of structure in the
consciousness of man it proceeds to occupy the place of preexisting
forms. The idea of perfection, held in the mind, will build a body
having for its attributes all the harmony possible to the organism in
which it is born. "God giveth it a body even as it pleased him, and to
each seed a body of its own." That "seed" is the true idea held in your
mind, through which the Holy Spirit nourishes and grows in you the new
body.

15\. If you refuse to receive the sensible ministrations

<span id="page_107">p. 107</span>

of this Holy Spirit, you, of course, cut off the builder of the eternal
temple in which God makes His permanent dwelling place in you.

16\. When you refuse to receive this baptism of the Holy Ghost, your
flesh is not quickened, and it must eventually go back to dust. In that
case you are again sent to school to learn the lesson in another earthly
experience.

17\. This is the law. Let him who has ears hear the law; let him not
oppose the construction of the temple that Spirit builds in obedience to
the thought held by the mind, and his body shall become an enduring,
deathless habitation of the living God. Let us, each one of us, see to
it that this opposition to Christ and His methods is not found within
us.

18\. If our teaching has been such as to disparage the entertainment of
the new sensations in the body when in prayer or in the silence, let us
cast those ideas out of our mind and throw ourselves wholly into the
care of Spirit. The mind of the flesh vigorously opposes this newcomer
in its domain, and if you side with it and ignorantly cast out Spirit,
you eventually will find yourself without a body. Having sinned against
the Holy Ghost, you become homeless in consequence.

19\. Pronounce every experience good, and of God, and by that mental
attitude you will call forth only the good. What seemed error will
disappear, and only the good will remain. This is the law, and no one
can break it. The Adversary always flees before the mind that is fixed
on the pure, the just, and the upright. There is no error in all the
universe

<span id="page_108">p. 108</span>

that can stand for one moment in the presence of the innocent mind.
Innocence is its own defense, and he who invokes the Father with pure
motive and upright heart need not fear any experience. God has not
forgotten His world nor the children of light. It is His will to build
in you His eternal habitation, and He will do it in a manner so
attractive that you will be delighted with the process after the first
few moves have been made. It is not always pleasant to tear down old
brick and mortar, but when the new structure begins to go up, there is
rejoicing.

20\. So you will find in your experience with the work of the Holy
Spirit in reconstructing your organism that the present structure must
be literally torn down atom by atom. It is in its present state
temporary and without the conscious life of the indwelling Spirit. You,
with the race, have separated yourself from God in consciousness; that
separation extends to the body, the most remote plane of consciousness.
In returning, the Father, the inner Spirit that is and ever has been
pure, first recognizes its true estate. This recognition is on the plane
of causes, the ideal, and may remain there for a long time. But the law
of seedtime and harvest prevails here, as in the natural world, and the
idea is the seed that will spring forth from its subjective realm. This,
when watered by the Holy Spirit through your receptive thought, grows a
new organism that will be a permanent battery from which you will
radiate the transcendent powers of Spirit forever and forever.

21\. When this is done, creation is a perfect,

<span id="page_109">p. 109</span>

homogeneous symphony of life, light, and love. Discord is eliminated;
sin, sorrow, and everything that in any way interferes with the highest
ideal of existence are dissolved, and man realizes that his dominion is
to be the obedient outlet of the inexhaustible inlet. Herein is God
glorified and His inexhaustible resources are not limited by man, but
allowed full and free flow into a universe without height or depth,
without beginning or ending.

22\. The true church of Christ is never organized upon the earth,
because the minute that man organizes his religion, he ceases to be
guided wholly by the free Spirit of truth, and to that extent he falls
away from the true church.

23\. Many of the Protestant sects were in their incipiency very close to
the original church. Wesley was led by Spirit, and his ministry was
characterized by a spiritual glow and power that was felt all over the
religious world. He was free; he had the freedom of Jesus Christ back of
him, yet he and his followers were despised by the organized church, and
it was a stinging epithet to be called a Methodist.

24\. The church of Jesus Christ still waits for a ministry that will
represent it as it is--an organization in heaven without a head on
earth, without a creed, without a line of written authority. This church
exists, and must be set up in its rightful place--the minds and the
hearts of men. It can never be confined to any external organization;
whoever attempts such a movement, by that act ceases to represent the
true church of Christ.

25\. There is need of such a church, an imperative

<span id="page_110">p. 110</span>

need that it be set up. Whoever advocates such a setting up, may for a
season expect the opposition of the organized institutions on every
hand, but the final outcome must be victory.

26\. There can be but one leader for man in his search for God--the
Spirit within him. When he unreservedly gives himself up to this Spirit
he finds that the old world of forms and their limitations are no longer
of interest. A new world is opened to his vision. What was the goal of
his human life becomes a mere toy to his expanded concepts of God and
the destiny of man.

27\. He finds that the church of Jesus Christ is not a church at all,
under the new definition. He has looked upon his religion as having to
do with the salvation of his soul--a sort of school in which he is
coached in catechism and creed, that he may be prepared to go to a place
called "heaven" after death.

28\. When the true church is revealed to his soul, all this illusion of
the animal man is dissolved. He finds that the church of Jesus Christ
has to do with the world right here and now; that it is not a religion,
as he has been accustomed to regard religion; that it is an organic
principle in nature working along definite lines of growth in the
building up of a state of consciousness for the whole human race.

29\. Thus the church of Jesus Christ is an exact science. It has its
part in the economy of Being, as the organizer of the unorganized. It
does not refer to things abstract, but to things concrete. Whoever

<span id="page_111">p. 111</span>

looks upon it as an abstraction has wholly misconceived it.

30\. God never performs miracles, if by miracle is meant a departure
from universal law. Whatever the prophets did was done by the operation
of laws inherent in Being and open to the discovery of every man.

31\. Whatever Jesus of Nazareth did, it is likewise the privilege of
every man to do. The ability to do such works as He did is simply a
question of discernment. Discernment comes through the functioning of an
orderly organic structure, which is in the soul of every man. It is
first a state of consciousness, a perception of what is in the
potential; this then formulates itself into a working structure that
becomes in every man the permanent church of Christ.

32\. The church of Christ covers every department of man's existence and
enters into every fiber of his being. He carries it with him day and
night, seven days of the week. He lives in it as a fish lives in water;
as he becomes conscious of its enveloping presence, he is transformed
into a new creature. Life becomes an ecstasy, and his cup is full to
overflowing.

33\. The burdens of the human drop out of sight just as fast as the
organic church is constructed. The construction of this church is
orderly, definite, and exact. It is not done in a moment, but little by
little the man is built from the within to the without, a new creature
in consciousness and in body.

34\. This means that your body will be so transformed

<span id="page_112">p. 112</span>

within and even without that it will never go through the change called
death. It will be a resurrected body, becoming more and more refined as
you catch sight of the free truths of Being, until it will literally
disappear from the sight of those who see with the eye of sense.

35\. This is the way in which the last enemy, "death," is to be
overcome. The corruptible shall put on incorruption right here and now.
Be careful not to defer this change to some future state, some day of
judgment, some sound of a last trump, but recognize it in the light of
an organic change occurring in and through your body, from day to day,
until you literally shine with the glory of the noonday sun.

36\. This is the promised New Jerusalem, a city in which neither the sun
nor the moon is necessary. This is the city of God within you, and your
body shall become so illuminated by the brilliancy of your mind that the
light streaming forth will be brighter than that of the sun. This is not
a fanciful sketch, but a statement of facts based upon spiritual
dynamics of which the body is the dynamo.

37\. Metaphysicians in this age have caught sight of the possibilities
that are man's when he consciously recognizes his relation to God and
proceeds to carry out in thought, and to act right here, that which he
perceives to be true in Spirit; but many of them are not wise in their
methods of attaining the ultimate organic building. They have made
connection with the realm of ideas, but are loath to comply with the
requirements of organic growth from the generative idea to its concrete
structure.

<span id="page_113">p. 113</span>

This growth is the construction of the church of Jesus Christ in each
one of us, and it is a most delicate and intricate process. No external
architect is here allowed; only Spirit can tell what is necessary from
day to day, and Spirit can be heard only by the attentive ego.

38\. If you have any ideas of your own as to how this new body is to be
constructed, drop them immediately. If you have been before the public
as a teacher of divine science, and have set up in consciousness
abstract theories about the unreality of the body and its sensations,
you will be willing to give them all up before you can be received into
the regeneration. Although you may have served Truth long and
faithfully, do not be rebellious if all your labors seem as dust and
ashes. The rebellious Israelites never entered the Promised Land. You
must be obedient. You must be willing to give up all your plans, your
hopes, and your ambitions. Spirit wants all your attention. If you have
done good, you will be rewarded, but you must not claim your good as a
merit card that gives you any preference in the regeneration. You must
be willing to become as nothing in the sight of men--virtually crucified
for your good works. Then your personal mentality loses its center, the
atoms of your being swiftly change their polarization from the material
to the spiritual plane, and you come forth from the tomb of sense with a
body of light.
