###  

An individual who needs to realize and draw upon God's light and life
and power and substance for health and sustenance cannot make the grade
so long as he or she is so situated that it is the way of least
resistance to let others do for him or her that which they feel
impelled, from love or any other motive, to do.

Each one of us is inseparably one with God, the source and substance of
life and wisdom and every good. Each one must draw upon the source for
his own sustenance, and for his own light and willpower.

Parents too often claim the children who come to them as their own, and
feel that they must think for them and do for them and take
responsibility for them. This is done until the child loses his
God-given initiative and comes from habit to depend on others. This
thought grows up with him, but all the time he resents this state of
affairs, yet he has not developed the ability to launch out for himself,
nor does he know that he possesses enough latent wisdom to work out his
difficulties.

Here is where God as universal law steps in. Where there has been
failure to know and to measure up to the divine plan of life,
circumstances arise, experiences come that make it necessary for the
individual to pull apart and to rely more upon himself.

<span id="page_23">p. 23</span>

If these individuals will make the most of such opportunities, and seek
to develop from within the latent God-given resources and abilities,
they will swing clear of the old entanglements and dependencies, and
learning to draw on the Source, they will bring forth their own
God-given good. If an individual fails to see wherein he has
transgressed the law of life and omnipresent good, he will continue to
claim responsibilities that are not his and burdens that he need not
assume and that hinder his progress. He may through special prayer and
effort realize a measure of harmony and health, but he will not know the
fullness of good until he recognizes God as the omnipresent life and
substance, ready to meet the needs of all His children in the way of
Spirit and without burden or worry to any of them. Truth means little
until it is applied to individual cases and needs.

If a person would be healed and would keep getting younger and more
vigorous and alert and ready for what the times demand of him, he must
get out of the rut, change his habits, appropriate the life elements in
food, in the sunshine, and especially in Truth statements.

Instead of thinking about his apparent condition, of the race thought
with which he may have been struggling, or his age, he is to concentrate
his attention upon God, that he may become so aware of God's presence
and God's perfect pattern of life and God's

<span id="page_24">p. 24</span>

qualities that he will forget old errors, and dissolve the conditions
that he has built up from dependence on something or someone outside
himself.

God is the one perfect life flowing through us. God is the one pure
substance out of which our organism is formed. God is the power that
gives us motive power; the strength that holds us upright and allows us
to exercise our members; the wisdom that gives us intelligence in every
cell of our organism, every thought of our minds. God is the only
reality of us; all else is but a shadow that is cast by some foolish
belief or unwise combination of thoughts and the elements of being. When
we let light flood us with its sunshine, all clouds vanish and we begin
to see ourselves in new ways of doing, which lead to wholeness and
health and satisfaction and growth.

The free flow of God's life through us becomes hindered in its
expression if our thoughts and acts imply a belief in a limited number
of years, in a hoarding of strength or substance or supply. We must
prove here and now, for ourselves, our faith in God as omnipresent good
and eternal life.

God in the midst of us is a great steady stream of renewing and
cleansing and vitalizing life, and we can have the use of this life if
we will open up the channels of its flowing and ourselves draw from this
source.

<span id="page_25">p. 25</span>

God has put in each of us the germ of immortality which will bring forth
its kind. "Every sound tree bears good fruit" (Mt. 7:17).

So within us is this almightiness that we must cooperate with. As we
cooperate with the Spirit of God in fulfilling His plan in us, all that
is within us bursts into the beauty of wholeness.

The moment a person yields his self to Godlikeness, he is letting the
Spirit of God burst the shell of doubt and fear, and the light of faith
reveals to him the light of life. He becomes conscious of the joy of
life, the joy of life in himself and in everyone else.

Yielding self means giving up the old concepts of the past; forgetting
ourselves and our human desire to come forth, and just rejoicing that
all God's creation constantly springs forth in newness of life and light
and joy and service. When we forget our own desires and devote ourselves
to doing what God would have done, this moment and constantly, we shall
find that there is no limit to the strength we have and the things we
can do. We have yielded ourselves to the source and entered into a
oneness that makes us receptive to all that the source is and holds for
us.

All God's blessings are for every child of the Father, and each
individual should learn to receive direct from his indwelling source.
Every individual has to live his own life and draw for himself upon the
life, substance, health, and strength that are waiting to be brought
forth. No one can eat another's food for him, or breathe for him;
neither can one person express the indwelling

<span id="page_26">p. 26</span>

life and health for another. Each one of us must draw upon the source of
these things for himself. Blessed are we when we recognize that this is
the way of receiving, and do it.
