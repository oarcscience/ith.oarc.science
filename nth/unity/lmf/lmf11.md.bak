###  

There is no such thing as a "disease" or incurable condition. These
activities, weaknesses, or abnormalities to which the medical profession
gives name are but the efforts of the God-given inner intelligence to
deal with conditions that the individual has produced by his failure to
understand the Truth and to recognize himself as the perfect child of
God, and to live by the divine law of life. Anything that does not
measure up to the Christ pattern of perfection can be changed. Anything
that the ideas of God-Mind, expressing in the mind of man, have not
produced can be dissolved into the original nothingness by the
understanding application of the power of spiritual thought and the
resultant spiritual action.

Doctors, of course, judge by appearances, founding their opinions upon
the study of effects, and drawing their conclusions from the outworking
of mistakes the patients have made.

No one who has awakened spiritually and is seeing his threefold being in
the light of Truth would speak of disease as something of itself. He
would not think for a moment that the mind was fixed in old race beliefs
or errors, nor that his body was unresponsive to the Spirit.

So when someone comes to us who has had a doctor

<span id="page_45">p. 45</span>

diagnose his illness, we ask him to turn from the doctor's opinions and
verdict and cease to think of the name he gave to the condition that
existed at the time of the examination and treatment. We ask him to cast
out the assumption that this condition would not be changed and done
away with, just as one would refuse to hold to and to think of some
unworthy and untrue thing that he might have heard spoken as he walked
down the street.

He is to begin at once to rejoice that he is the offspring of God, that
the life and the substance of his body and the perfect pattern of that
life and body are gifts of God, gifts that are in reality inseparably
one with His own being, the very essence of God-life and God substance
and God intelligence. It is God's plan, you know, to have the creation
picture forth, express His ideas, qualities, and being. It is our
purpose in being here to become conscious of and to express in our lives
the true pattern and qualities of our Father-Mother.

We know very well that God would not create a person with imperfections
and shortcomings and disease. We also know that God would not create
automatons without free-will and the privilege of exercising their
powers of sonship. Just as we give our children--in our own thought of
them and in our endeavors to have them live as they should that they may
come forth clothed perfectly--the best that we can conceive, and then
permit them to unfold their powers and faculties and their body temples
as the inner intelligence and

<span id="page_46">p. 46</span>

life prompts. We give them the best instruction we have to offer, but if
we are wise, we permit the Spirit within them to develop the soul, that
it may express their individual gifts.

We accept the God-given perfection. We wave aside the past mistakes and
the untrue suggestions, and fix undivided attention upon the Creator and
the inner pattern of perfection. In this lies the success of spiritual
treatment. We bring all the mental attitudes and the centers of
consciousness, and even the physical structures, to this high place in
mind where we see as God sees and where we name all that is within us
according to the patterns and uses for which these soul qualities and
their outpicturing have been created.

We prayerfully consider all our living habits to get a better
understanding of their purposes and to know whether or not they are
chording with the divine law of health. We consider whether or not we
are worrying or fearing anything. We look back of the conscious mind
into the realm of the subconsciousness, or memory, to determine whether
there is anything that took place in the past that is continuing its
disturbing influence through the unconscious expressions of mind. Much
of the habit side of life is made up of these past experiences and
trainings. Many things we do daily are not consciously thought out but
are the continuation of something impressed upon us long ago.

We rejoice and remember that we have the God-power

<span id="page_47">p. 47</span>

to change conditions, the God-love to express Christlikeness, and we
work lovingly and diligently with whatever we find in ourselves or our
environment that falls short. Keeping the attention centered in the
Christ Mind, we are able to see beyond appearances to the impulses of
the soul, which is always urging us in our efforts to make use of what
God has given. To the degree that we let Christ be lifted up, in the
same degree shall we rid ourselves of that which may have been
pronounced incurable or may have seemed to us a disease that was
incurable. Let us remember what Jesus Christ said, "With God all things
are possible" (Mt. 19:26), and let us listen until we hear within, "Is
anything too hard for Jehovah?"

Any thought that is not based on the eternal reality, Truth, has no
existence. If we believe in disease we are believing in something that
has no substance or reality. When we dissolve the belief out of our
minds and in its place establish the realization of the one presence and
power of good, and exercise our faith in health as the one presence and
power within us, we shall feel the conviction that we are the expression
of the health that God is.

This powerful conviction of oneness with divine wholeness will become
abiding--nothing can take it from us. "God is love," and His love has
cast out of the mind and heart all fear. There is no room for doubts and
fears because God as love and health reigns supreme in us.

We set to work to change any and everything that

<span id="page_48">p. 48</span>

we may find does not measure up to the best that our new light shows us.
We know that it is of much more importance to change and to do that
which is best for our progress and our health, than to be smugly
consistent, or to make the excuse that we have always done a thing and
that it is too late to change. The moment we discover something
undesirable in our minds or our lives we should seek to make the changes
necessary to bring the desirable into manifestation.
