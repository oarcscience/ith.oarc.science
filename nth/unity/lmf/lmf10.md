<span class="small">"His delight is in the law of the Lord,  
and on his law he meditates day and night."--Ps. 1:2  
</span>

"Day and night" does not necessarily mean twenty-four hours of time. It
has reference to the daytime of the soul--when it has light, and
everything seems to be going smoothly, and it can see evidence that the
divine law is working; and to the nighttime of the soul--when a person
has gone as far as the light of his consciousness will take him in a
given direction, and when he must turn within and wait for more light.

You may not see how the law of the Lord is working for you, but it is
working just as surely as the law of growth is operative during
nighttime. Nighttime is necessary to the proper growth and development
of plants, just as the daytime and sunlight with their warmth are
necessary.

We wouldn't say that "business is dull" with the plants during the night
or that they are not receiving their good. On the contrary, we have many
times seen a transformation through the night. A plant that had seemed
almost dead for lack of moisture and the ability to draw from the earth
the required elements will be crisp and strong and very desirable in the
morning!

Had it not been for the night with its blessings, that plant would have
ceased to grow and to yield its helpfulness to us.

When "nighttime" comes to us, we should use it as a quiet time of great
help. If we do, it will afford us time for meditation and the careful
study of ourselves and our present methods and plan of service. It will
cause us to turn more to the universal law and its operation and less to
our personal efforts and the ways of others.

In this nighttime we are to rest in the spiritual knowledge and
assurance that our growth is precious in the sight of the Lord. We are
to rejoice that the divine law is ever operative, ever working to
prosper all of God's children. We are to give thanks that our affairs
are in the Father's hands and under the management of divine wisdom.

We shall rise up to be glad for this "night" in which we have turned
within to the great stream of light, life, love, substance, and power,
and have let them flow silently into our consciousness, to raise it to
the Christ understanding. As we do this, we will know that we are:

<span class="small">"Like a tree planted by streams of water,  
that yields its fruit in its season,  
and its leaf does not wither.  
In all that he does, he prospers."--Ps. 1:3
