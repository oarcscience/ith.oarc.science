###  

Students should not try so hard to "go into the silence." When your
growth brings you to the place where your consciousness may be so
completely merged with Christ ideas in God-Mind that you lose all sense
of things about you, it is time to seek to go into the silence. But one
should not try to hurry this experience. Anything that is an effort and
that disturbs the natural functioning of the body is not going to bring
your mind into conscious at-one-ment with the source of your light and
every good.

It is because a person tries to force the process of going into the
silence before he is ready for it that he has that unpleasant
experience, about which some ask, of the heart's beating so rapidly and
hard. This comes from trying to get the body to become inactive in the
effort to go into the silence. Instead of stirring up greater activity,
laying hold of more life and using it, you cause the body to become
tense. Therefore, the heart must pump harder to do its work. When wisdom
and love and life and power prompt your thoughts, you are living and
moving and having your being in the very presence of God, and you know
that all is well. Then you will be able to concentrate upon anything
that requires your attention, and you will be quiet and poised and
comfortable. With a relaxed body

<span id="page_28">p. 28</span>

you will lay hold of more life activity and come forth refreshed.

When you start to go into the silence, you should breathe evenly, in the
happy feeling that you are taking in great drafts of God's pure
life-sustaining air, which is being used by every cell and blood
corpuscle.

Take your attention down out of your head into the organism. The flow of
blood will follow your attention down into the trunk of the body and
into your feet and hands, and thus the forces of being as well as the
flow of the bloodstream will be equalized. You should be just as fair to
the members of your body as you would be to a neighbor. You wouldn't
expect to hold the neighbor's attention on one thing all day long. Nor
would you expect to demand of your neighbor that she do without
something that she should have, nor would you burden her with more work
than she should do. Now you are to treat your own members (which are
close neighbors in your body temple) with as much consideration and
wisdom and love, giving them the benefit of this quiet time with the
divine Creator.

A period of quiet and rest each day is your opportunity to establish
yourself at the center of your being, the one place where the supply of
life and substance is inexhaustible. God is this eternal life that we
make into living. Each day you should have a period of stillness when
the soul may gather sustaining power

<span id="page_29">p. 29</span>

and restoring life. God gives freely; it is for us to keep the receiving
channels open, to keep attuned to the realities so that our intellect
does not take us out among the limited ideas of the world. The manifest
man must have the sustenance that can come only from within. We should
not draw the strings of this instrument of Spirit so tight that the
music of the soul cannot find expression, but this is what living in the
world without withdrawal to the secret place does to us.

One can stay in the silence too much. It is merely the doorway to that
which is beyond the silence; i. e., activity based upon the light and
strength gained in claiming it, accomplished by contacting it as the
mind slips away from the clamor of dissipating thoughts. One can get too
much of this good thing, just as one can get too much good nourishing
food, and then sit still, failing to convert it into living energy and
the results of that energy. So, dear, watch that you do not remain too
much alone, too much in the silence, too much in contemplation and
adoration, and not enough in the practical use of what the walks and
talks alone with God would give. The Indian goes solitary into the
forest to gain a sense of his superior strength and poise. He comes back
to familiar scenes and regular activities, and runs, and leaps, and
rides, and sings, and plants, and harvests, and tells the stories that
inspire his race, and ministers to those in need in the spirit of love.
He takes plenty of time to play, and he works at nothing while he's
playing!

Instead of spending too much time in the silence,

<span id="page_30">p. 30</span>

make practical use of what you have already gotten from study and from
the silence. It is possible to waste strength and energy and substance
in dwelling in that passive mental state sometimes called the silence,
or in the personal effort to make certain thoughts go out and accomplish
results that are not based on the divine order and plan of life. So when
you turn to the secret place for silence, be sure that you get away from
yourself, your old ideas and desires, and bring your mind into perfect
harmony with Christ ideas. Work to bring those ideas to bear upon your
thought centers, and then come forth to practice what you have seen with
spiritual vision and declared for yourself.

The more you think about the Christ within, the stronger will grow your
consciousness of the divine presence and your oneness with Him, until
you can "be still, and know that I am God"; until you can still all the
outer thoughts and meditate upon "Christ in you, the hope of glory."
Many have been helped mightily, gloriously in finding the silence, by
repeating "Jesus Christ" time after time, with short intervals between.

When you go into the silence, it would be well for you to direct your
attention into your organism, away from your head. The flow of blood
will follow the attention, and thus the forces of your being and the
flow of the bloodstream will be equalized.

You owe God attention. You owe God the full

<span id="page_31">p. 31</span>

measure of your faith, of your thought, of your service. God abides in
your mind as the wisdom that will reveal the way to you if you will
quiet your thoughts from their ceaseless outer searching for ways and
means. God not only gives you wisdom, God is the wisdom that can direct
you into paths of peace and plenty. You cannot listen to God while your
ear is given to your affairs. You can gain nothing by incessantly
milling around in negative thought. You can gain all by quietly letting
go of these outer appearances and laying hold of God.

You love Jesus Christ and He is now with you, guiding you and teaching
you, bringing you consciously into oneness with the Father. His prayer
was: "That they may be one, even as we are one" (Jn. 17:11). His mission
is to bring us into unity with the Father, and His promise is: "Lo, I am
with you always" (Mt. 28:20). He taught us to pray in this way: "When
you pray, go into your room and shut the door and pray to your Father
who is in secret" (Mt. 6:6). The inner chamber is that quiet place
within the heart. We are taught to center our thoughts within, and then
to shut the door; that is, to close our minds to all other thinking and
think about God and His goodness and love; to pray to God in secret, in
the secret place of the Most High, and all things needful will be added.

"Speak to Him, thou, for He hears, and Spirit with Spirit can meet--

Closer is He than breathing, and nearer than hands and feet."--Alfred,
Lord Tennyson.

<span id="page_32">p. 32</span>

That is what the poet says to help us remember how close and loving God
is. Speak to God in the quiet of your heart, just as you would speak to
me; tell the Father how much you desire to know Him and feel His loving
presence and how glad you are to receive His blessings and to do His
will. Then be very still and feel God's love enfold you.

Be still. Be still. Be still. God in the midst of you is substance. God
in the midst of you is love. God in the midst of you is wisdom. Let not
your thoughts be given to lack, but let wisdom fill them with the
substance and faith of God. Let not your heart be a center of resentment
and fear and doubt. Be still and know that at this moment it is the
altar of God, of love; love so sure and unfailing, love so irresistible
and magnetic that it draws your supply to you from the great storehouse
of the universe. Trust God, use God's wisdom, prove and express God's
love.

As you come out of the silence, count your blessings and give thanks for
them. Realize that only good exists in you and in your world, that the
power you contacted in the silence may have opportunity to multiply and
increase your blessings. Give thanks that you have already received the
good for which you looked to God in the silence, feeling the assurance,
"Before they call I will answer, while they are yet speaking I will
hear" (Is. 65:24).

<span id="page_33">p. 33</span>

On the "mountaintop" we receive new illumination, inspiration, and
insight into the providing law. Then we have a work to do away from the
mountaintop, lifting our thoughts to the Truth standard. We should carry
the light, joy, peace, and strength we receive on the spiritual heights
of consciousness into our everyday life for the purpose of redeeming the
human part of us.

Jesus had His times on the mountaintop, but afterward He descended to
minister to the needy ones. This symbolizes our habit of giving
attention to thoughts of lack, weakness, negativeness and redeeming them
by bringing them into the Spirit, after we have entered the "secret
place of the Most High" and communed with the Father.

The thing to bear in mind is to take with you and hold on to all that
you gain on the mountaintop of prayer, and not let go of it when you
meet the thoughts and states of mind on the material plane that need to
be spiritualized. In other words, maintain your spiritual poise and
control when you meet adverse thoughts; otherwise you cannot redeem the
Adversary.

When we seek God, our temporal as well as spiritual needs are supplied.
The providing law will always work for us when we work with it.

"By wisdom a house is built,

and by understanding it is established;

by knowledge the rooms are filled

with all precious and pleasant riches" (Prov. 24:3-4).

<span id="page_34">p. 34</span>

It is through the development of our minds that we find the way to
success. God is mind. "We have the mind of Christ," and it is for us to
make conscious union in the silence with the all-providing Mind, lifting
our thoughts to its standard of Truth and holding them in this Truth as
we go about our duties of living.
