# Unity
<title>Intangible Textual Heritage: Unity Church</title>

These are the key writings of the Unity Church, a major New Thought
movement. Most of the early writings of Charles Fillmore, the founder of
Unity, are in the public domain in the US because they were not renewed
in a timely fashion. The two books below published prior to 1923 are in
the public domain in the US because of their date of publication. A
search of the online copies of US copyright office records for this
period showed no renewals for the rest of these works.

The bibliographic data for the listings below is speculative, based on a
search of online library catalogs. I would appreciate any information
about the edition which these etexts were created from, specifically the
date of original publication.
