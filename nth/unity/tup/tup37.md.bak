HOW PRAYER HEALING IS DONE

FROM A STUDY of the foregoing lessons, you should be convinced that man
and the universe are under the creative direction of a supreme being,
name it what you will, and that man needs but to conform to the laws of
creative Mind in order to be healthy, happy, and wise. It logically
occurs to you that all healing methods, whether applied to self or to
others, consists in establishing the unity of the individual and the
universal consciousness. No man heals himself or another; the supreme
Mind does the work. "The Father abiding in me does his works," said
Jesus. This is the testimony of all the truly wise.

The first move in all healing is a recognition on the part of the healer
and on the part of the patient that God is present as an all-powerful
mind, equal to the healing of every disease, no matter how bad it may
appear. "With God all things are possible." The best way to establish
unity with the Father-Mind is by prayer. "God is Spirit," and He has a
kingdom or ruling center in every soul. Do not look up or out for God,
but "pray to thy Father who is in secret \[silently within your own
soul\], and thy Father who seeth in secret shall recompense thee."

<span id="page_178">p. 178</span>

Many healers use the Lord's Prayer at the beginning of every treatment.
Talk to the Father as if He were an entity present within you. He is
visible to your soul, and when you have attained the particular inner
confidence called faith, you will realize His presence as clearly as you
realize visible things. When you have stilled the outer senses and have
become quiet, you are in the mental realm where thoughts are obedient to
the word. Error thoughts must be told to go, and true thoughts must be
called to take their proper place.

Mental causes are so complex that it is impossible to point out in all
cases the specific thought that causes a certain disease; but twelve
fundamental mind activities lie at the base of all existence, and when
any one of these is contacted, all the others respond.

Nearly all sick people lack vital force, hence the life treatment is
good for all. Hate, anger, jealousy, malice, and the like are almost
universal in human consciousness, and a treatment for love will prove a
healing balm for all.

Fear of poverty burdens most people, and the prosperity treatment will
be effective. Do not be afraid to use the statements in healing as a
whole or in part; they will always help and never hurt anyone. Remember
that the object of all treatment is to raise the mind to the Christ
consciousness, through which all true healing is accomplished.

SAMPLE PRAYER TREATMENTS

Fear, anxiety, worry, dread, and suspense--these thoughts cause the mind
to become tense, thus shutting out the great helper, the Spirit of
truth. Say silently:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">I am now free from fear, anxiety, worry, dread,
and  
suspense. I have faith in Thy Holy Spirit, and I trust Thee  
to protect me, to provide for me, and to bring all my  
affairs into divine order.  
</span>

</div>

NERVOUSNESS

The mind sends its messages along the nerves; the nerves, forming a
network of communication with the brain, get into a chronic
crosscurrented condition from the presence of repeated anxious, worried,
fearful thoughts, and the many forms of nervousness result. This idea of
nervousness must be specifically denied and the truth affirmed. Say
silently:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">I am not subject to any kind of nervousness. My
nerves are  
harmonized, peaceful, and poised in Spirit and in Truth.  
</span>

</div>

Note: Deny the mental cause first; then the physical appearance.
Nervousness is produced by worry, anxiety, and the like. These mental
conditions should be healed first; then the secondary state which they
have produced in the body must be denied and dissolved, and the perfect
condition affirmed.

<span id="page_180">p. 180</span>

COLDS, GRIPPE, AND THE INFLUENZAS

Affirm:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Spirit is not subject to heat or cold. I am Spirit.
I am  
the positive force of Being, and I put out of my  
consciousness all negative thoughts. I do not believe in  
the thing called a cold, nor do I admit for a moment that  
it has any power over me. I am Spirit, free-flowing life,  
and my circulation is equalized in God.  
</span>

</div>

STOMACH TROUBLES

Prayer:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">My understanding is established in Spirit. I know
the  
relation between mind and body, between thought and  
substance. I agree with what I eat, and what I eat agrees  
with me. I am at peace with all men and all things. I do  
not resist or antagonize anybody or anything. My stomach is  
strong, wise, and energetic, and I always think and speak  
of it as in every way capable of doing the work given it to  
do. I do not impose upon my stomach by overloading it. I am  
guided by divine wisdom in eating and drinking, and I  
follow its dictates instead of the sense appetites. I am no  
longer anxious about what I shall eat or what I shall  
drink. I am not hurried or worried, but after each meal I  
rest from all the cares of life, and I give my stomach  
opportunity to do its perfect work under the divine law.  
</span>

</div>

<span id="page_181">p. 181</span>

All Liver Troubles

Prayer:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">I am not misjudged, nor do I misjudge others. I do
not  
criticize or condemn. I do not hold bitter, revengeful  
thoughts against others. I do not think that I have been  
unjustly treated. God-Mind is my supreme arbiter, and I  
rest all judgment in the divine law of justice. The swift  
energy of Spirit now penetrates and permeates every atom of  
my liver, and it is free to do its perfect work.  
</span>

</div>

Kidney, Bladder, and Urinay Disorders

Prayer:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">God is the strength of my life. I do not believe
in  
exhaustion of strength. Strength is always present in  
supreme completeness, and I am eternally strong. Spirit is  
the strength of my loins, and my back is free from all  
thought of burdens. My life is divinely ordered, and I am  
not afraid of weakness, old age, or death. All the issues  
of my life are from God, and He is a well of living water  
within me.  
Lustful passions no longer separate me from the pure,  
spiritual life. My life is lifted up by the Christ Mind,  
and I am resurrected from the dead. My life is hid with  
Christ in God.  
</span>

</div>

<span id="page_182">p. 182</span>

All Throat Affections

Prayer:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">All power is given to me, in heaven (mind) and in
earth  
(body). Dominion, control, and mastery are mine by divine  
right, and I refuse to believe in failure or discouragement.  
I am free, and the inspiration of Spirit is poured into my  
soul. I am quickened by Spirit, and the flesh is obedient.  
I rejoice and am glad because the joy of Christ is mine. I  
am filled with Spirit energy, and every cell in my organism  
is alight with God. I am the resurrection and the life.  
</span>

</div>

SIX-DAY PRAYER TREATMENTS

It is found that the mind establishes a permanent consciousness through
six steps or stages, called in Genesis "days."

First, the mind perceives and affirms Truth to be a universal principle.
Secondly, faith in the working power of Truth is born in consciousness.
Thirdly, Truth takes definite form in mind. Fourthly, the will carries
Truth into acts. Fifthly, discrimination is quickened and the difference
between Truth and error is discerned. Sixthly, every thought and word is
expressed in harmony with Truth.

The seventh "day" represents a peaceful confidence and rest in the
fulfillment of the divine law.

By the use of these denials and affirmations for one week a new and more
orderly basis of thought

<span id="page_183">p. 183</span>

is established in mind, and the whole man is harmonized and vitalized.
This process often heals obstinate cases, and the six-ray course is
recommended in conjunction with the special prayers.

Make your denials as if you were gently sweeping away cobwebs, and make
your affirmations in a strong, bold, vehement positive attitude of mind.

Each day's treatment, and the whole course of treatments if necessary,
is to be repeated over and over until it manifests its living presence
and potency in consciousness.

If you desire to help a patient who will not try or who cannot himself
successfully bring his mind into harmonious relations with Principle,
think of this person when you hold the daily thought, and Spirit will
cause your word to be manifested both in you and in him.

Invocation
