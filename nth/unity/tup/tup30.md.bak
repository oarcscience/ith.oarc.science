<span class="small">My understanding of Truth reveals the unreality of
sickness  
and the reality of health. I am radiant with the  
understanding that abiding health is my divine inheritance.  
My understanding of the omnipresence of elemental substance  
opens the door to a continuous inflow of superabundance  
into my mind and affairs.

LACK OF understanding, not only individual but collective, confronts us
on every side. We blunder through life instead of walking confidently,
open-eyed. Or we sit in the City of Indecision waiting for something to
turn up when, urged and guided by the inner light, we should be going
forth to meet good fortune.

We never weary of quoting that wise observation of Job's "There is a
spirit in man, and the breath of the Almighty giveth them
understanding." Most persons think that understanding is gained by
intellectual development, mostly in institutions of

<span id="page_130">p. 130</span>

learning. But the Book of Job was written by one who had great
understanding but no literary degrees, so far as is known. Some
authorities claim the book is at least five thousand years old; but Job
knew much about Spirit both in Jehovah and in man. In the passage quoted
he uses the pronoun "them" instead of "he" in referring to man, thus
revealing that he understood the spiritual nature of man to be dual:
male and female. Job's familiarity with Spirit and spiritual laws is
evidence to a metaphysician that he gained his understanding direct from
Spirit. Jesus taught, "It is the spirit that giveth life."

We would not belittle intellectual knowledge if it is acquired under the
guidance of Spirit. The one and only object of man's existence is the
development of his soul, and any attainment, whether mental or material,
that cannot be associated with and counted as an aid toward that end
will ultimately be refused. So it is the concentration of the mind upon
Spirit that reveals the truth about the many situations that meet us in
our daily contacts. If we count health and disease as equal, the
"thought stuff" of our mind will animate them with like potency. We
shall find ourselves believing that disease is just as real and far more
catching than health.

Yet a moment's analysis of the relation between disease and health shows
that health is the real, the God-given condition, and disease the
unreal, the abnormal, from which we are all seeking to escape. Truth not
only shows the reality at the core of all

<span id="page_131">p. 131</span>

things; it also shows that we shall never escape from the unreal so long
as we allow our mental processes to clothe it with "thought stuff."

If you deny disease as devoid of reality and affirm health as spiritual
and abiding, the Spirit will bear witness with your spirit and you will
demonstrate health.

Daily concentration of mind on Spirit and its attributes reveals to man
that the elemental forces that make matter are here in the ether
awaiting our recognition and appropriation. It is not necessary to know
all the details of the scientific law in order to demonstrate
prosperity. Go into the silence daily at a stated time and concentrate
on the substance of Spirit prepared for you from the foundation of the
world. You will thus open up a current of thought that will bring
prosperity into your affairs.
