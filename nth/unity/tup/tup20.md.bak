PSYCHOANALYSIS is growing more popular every day because it measures the
capacity of the soul. We are all interested in our soul and how to save
it. Those who follow Jesus go one step further in soul therapy than the
average psychoanalyst; they incorporate Spirit with soul and make it the
primal source and sustainer of both soul and body. "It is the spirit
that quickeneth."

We make our soul out of the thoughts and words we entertain.
Consequently we should be very careful in choosing our words, because
they are the means by which we convey Spirit to character and its
structure. So instead of psychoanalysis let us say we have Spirit
psychoanalysis.

Every word has its root in an idea, whether this idea is reflected from
within or not. When we wish

<span id="page_91">p. 91</span>

to approve, extol, applaud, or commend we praise and bless. Words of
this kind and the mental attitudes that they set up stimulate, quicken,
whirl into action, and finally establish in character the ideals of
which they are the vehicle. So let us remember that we use words as
instruments of ideas and that it is the idea that we are seeking to
enlarge and establish by our words of praise and blessing.

So "praise" and "bless" are words freely used by those who love
spiritual values, because these words are heavily charged with capacity
to express creative Mind. In themselves alone the words "praise" and
"bless" are potent for good because they are associated with ideas that
eulogize the good. These words are not found in the vocabulary of the
pessimist or atheist. From various sources we learn that scientists are
experimenting with instruments like the lie tester that register mind
emotions. These instruments measure the force of fear and courage,
sorrow and joy; in fact every emotion and mental attitude is coming
under scientific observation, and it will not be long before we can
produce graphs of the power of every thought as it registers on the
nerve and brain cells of the body. When these brain testers definitely
prove that certain emotions not only stimulate but permanently enlarge
brain areas the cultivation of constructive states of mind will become
part of our common-school curriculums.

Metaphysicians find that words that express thanks, gratitude, and
praise release latent energies of mind and spirit; and the effects of
their use follow

<span id="page_92">p. 92</span>

so quickly that they can almost be identified with the originating
words.

Let your words of praise and blessing be to Spirit and the increase will
be even greater than it has been when addressed to man. The resource of
Spirit are beyond our highest flights of imagination. You can praise a
weak body into strength, a fearful heart into peace and trust; shattered
nerves into poise and power; a failing business into prosperity and
success; want and insufficiency into supply and support.

The healing and prosperity thougths in this chapter are a guide for
those who are trying to demonstrate the power of words to regulate
health and finances. If you are in need of health use the statement as
printed, putting special emphasis on the words "strength" and "power."
When using these health-producing words, direct your attention to Spirit
as if it were an interpenetrating presence, which it is. Try to feel the
quickening spiritual harmony and health, which will be manifested at
once or later, depending on your attitude toward the time element. If
you join in thought with Silent Unity every night from nine to ten
o'clock you will get a powerful uplift. In demonstrating prosperity you
should praise and bless even minor evidences of financial improvement.

Remember what Jesus said about your mental attitude in demonstrating
spiritually: "And all things, whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer,
believing, ye shall receive"; which may be rephrased thus: Pray,
believing that you have received, and you shall receive.
