<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Thy Spirit strengthens both my soul and my body, and
I rest  
in the peace of wholeness and health.  
Every anxious thought is stilled. Thy mighty confidence and  
Thy peace infold me. Omnipresent Spirit substance fills my  
mind, and abundance is everywhere manifest.

MANY CHRISTIAN metaphysicians who are quite familiar with the idea of
the omnipresence of God address Him in terms that imply His absence.
Instead of talking direct to God, who is always right in our midst, we
talk about Him. We are apt to say, "God strengthens both my soul and my
body" instead of "Thy Spirit strengthens both my soul and my body."

Our words betray our dominant state of mind, although the logic of Truth
may belie this. We see logically that there cannot be any separation in
spirit between the Creator and the created, but the created has the
power to think of itself as separate from its source, and this thought
makes a mental vacuum in which there is a total absence of spiritual

<span id="page_84">p. 84</span>

attributes. The human family on this planet has set up this sort of a
mental void, and unless we train our mind to think the truth, we find
ourselves talking to God as if He were in the next room or in some
faraway heaven in the skies.

We in our day and age are not alone in making God the third person in
our conversation. Bible authors did the same. We should remember that
the people who live today are the same people who lived in the past, in
other words, we are people who thought ourselves separate from God life
and thereby killed our body. We also are like some of the people who
acted the part of the prodigal son, desiring to be again united with the
Father.

However we should not forget that although the Father was "moved with
compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him," the prodigal
was yet "afar off." No one save Jesus has fully bridged this gulf of
separation, and we are excusable if we at times lapse into the old
consciousness of absence from the Father. Jesus gives us the right cue
when He affirms, "It is the spirit that giveth life; the flesh profiteth
nothing: the words that I have spoken unto you are spirit, and are
life."

"For as the Father hath life in himself, even so gave he to the Son also
to have life in himself."

We find that we must train our mind in trust, look persistently and
continuously to God for all things, and rest in the assurance that what
we ask and affirm in Spirit will surely come to pass. Jesus had such
supreme confidence and faith in the Father

<span id="page_85">p. 85</span>

as the source of health and prosperity that His name has become the
synonym and open door for the manifestation of those things. He said
that whatever we asked of the Father in His name would be granted. Many
persons get a very definite mental uplift and consciousness of Spirit by
repeating audibly and silently the name of Jesus Christ. But the name
does not represent the real character of the person unless it is known
to us through our acquaintance with the person himself. Unless you have
read about Jesus and tried to realize His love, wisdom, and supermind
power, you have no conception of the meaning of His name. Paul urged
that we let Christ be formed in us. That means that through the study of
the life of Jesus and the discipline He gave His mind we shall put into
our mind the same ideas that He had. These ideas will form in our mind a
new kind of man, which is God's man.

When you turn your attention to Spirit your mind makes contact with a
realm of ideas very much above the level of your common thinking; and
when you strike this mental stratosphere you are tremendously lifted up.
Then you make your statements of Truth and whatever you decree comes to
pass. Job's friend Eliphaz said to him:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Acquaint now thyself with him, and be at peace:  
Thereby good shall come unto thee . . . .  
Thou shalt also decree a thing, and it shall be established  
unto thee;  
And light shall shine upon thy ways"
