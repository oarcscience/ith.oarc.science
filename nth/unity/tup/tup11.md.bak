###  

ACCORDING to Genesis, Elohim God planned that man, created in His image
and likeness, should have all the qualities of his Maker. At first
glance this man created in the beginning seems the equal of God man or
God son.

Further insight into the creative process however reveals that man has a
work to do in developing his innate abilities, the "image" and
"likeness." Following the paragraph "Let us make man in our image, after
our likeness" we read: "And let them have dominion over the fish of the
sea, and over the birds of the heavens, and over the cattle, and over
all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the
earth. And God created man in his own image, in the image of God created
he him, male and female created he them. And God blessed them: and God
said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and
subdue it; and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the
birds . . . and over every living thing."

In modern language we would say that God imaged a man like Himself who
would fulfill the law of his being when he had gained the mastery

<span id="page_56">p. 56</span>

over certain forces in his field of activity. These forces are
symbolically described as "birds," "fish," "cattle," and "creeping
things," through which man replenishes the earth.

The whole Bible tells of man's experience in striving for the mastery.
In addition to the Bible, all the history of man is a record of how the
human family has struggled to fulfill the creative ideas implanted in it
from the beginning. The "birds of the heavens" are their high ideals,
the "cattle" or "beasts of the field" are of a low order, the "fish of
the sea" are their generated or accumulated impulses, and the "creeping
things" represent the micro-organisms of modern science that are claimed
to be the cause of most diseases. It has been assumed that man's
dominion was to be exercised through aggression, through physical
mastery. This idea has instigated man to wage war and rule by tyranny,
all of which his higher thoughts tell him is in direct violation of
divine law.

Our higher reason, backed by experience, forces us to look to another
source than the physical for a solution of the problem of "dominion."

As the great example of one who became a master through spiritual
unfoldment we point to Jesus, who became the Master of all masters.
Jesus was God manifest in the flesh.

Today Jesus Christ is the realized, ideal Master. He is the full,
perfect expression of the superman. In Him "dwelleth all the fulness of
the Godhead bodily." To Jesus Christ God was a being of infinite

<span id="page_57">p. 57</span>

goodness that He was to realize and express. So today through Jesus
Christ God is a being of infinite goodness that we are to realize and
express. Today the name Jesus Christ is called "Wonderful, Counsellor,
Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace." Jesus Christ is the
Master, majestic yet simple. His relation to man makes His tenderness
toward humanity exquisitely touching. When we think of the mighty
revolution that has taken place in the consciousness of the race through
His teaching, we realize at least to a degree what He has done for the
race.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"He that is slow to anger is better than the
mighty;  
And he that ruleth his spirit, than he that taketh a city."  
</span>

</div>

Jesus ruled His own spirit. Through Christ we are learning to rule our
own spirits, to gain the mastery over every word and thought, yes, over
every impulse of the whole being, not only on the soul plane but on the
physical plane as well. His presence right in our midst is teaching us
control. His presence right in our midst inspires us with new ideas,
incites us to go forward to achieve.

In the world of affairs a master is one who can enforce obedience, but
the Master of masters did not "enforce." Through His spiritual ability
He inspired obedience.

Jesus attained mastery over sin, sickness, death. He attained a
permanent state of consciousness where mortal weakness cannot enter.
Emerson says

<span id="page_58">p. 58</span>

that the measure of a master is his ability to bring all men around to
his opinion within twenty years. Today, as never before, two thousand
years after Jesus closed His ministry here on earth, He is bringing men
around to His opinion or rather to His truths as never before.

But Christ is also a servant. We follow Him because He serves best;
because He bears with us as we strive to overcome our sins--He bears our
sins with gentleness and patience. As we work in prayer with Him, He
leads us into a high state of spiritual consciousness where we realize
the allness of God and His laws.

When Jesus was asked by a crafty lawyer to name the greatest commandment
He quickly answered that all the Law and the Prophets could be
summarized thus: "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart,
and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. This is the great and
first commandment. And a second like unto it is this, Thou shalt love
thy neighbor as thyself. On these two commandments the whole law
hangeth, and the prophets." This is a test, a challenge, to all those
who would unfold spiritually. This attitude of mind brings us in tune
with Divine Mind so that we are prepared to receive its blessings. When
our thoughts are established in love, a divine synchronization takes
place. Divine Mind has a fixed rate of vibration to which, through
Christ, the mind of man is synchronized, just as a radio receiving set
is synchronized to the frequency of a broadcasting station. In order to

<span id="page_59">p. 59</span>

tap Divine Mind we must bring the rate of vibration of our mind up to
the standard, for it is only when our mind is vibrating at its most
accelerated rate that God can make Himself known to us. The efficiency
of the radio receiving set depends upon the number of its tubes and
their adjustment to the electromagnetic field in which its kilocycles
function. By this same law the perfect man must have his twelve great
powers developed, operating in perfect tune with Divine Mind, in order
to bring forth the image and likeness man.

In the silence when his mind is fixed steadily on God and is functioning
in the consciousness of infinite love, the activities of man's brain
cells synchronize with those of the very brain cells of the Master. Even
the intelligent principle of the love center responds, and thus man
becomes a spiritual radio with power to receive radiations from Divine
Mind as well as power to broadcast them throughout his whole organism.
He even is able to broadcast them throughout his environment near and
far, an ability that is limited only by the spiritual power he has
developed.

Humanity must bear in mind that it is traveling the road of spiritual
unfoldment and hold its eye on the goal. Right here in our midst, in the
mind realm as well as in the manifest world, will be developed a mighty
neutralizing power that will render all destructive powers null and
void, that will dissolve disease, and resurrect the consciousness of
peace, health, and abundance.
