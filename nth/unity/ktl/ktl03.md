###  The Way to Perfection Chapter 1 

I AM GOD ALMIGHTY; walk before me, and be thou perfect."

In prayer we need to be deeply conscious that God is the almighty One,
the supreme Creator the ruler of the universe, that He is infinite and
eternal; we need to know that God is the underlying, unchangeable Truth,
"with whom can be no variation, neither shadow that is cast by turning."

God as principle is the absolute good expressed in all creation. When we
know God and "worship him in spirit and truth" we recognize Him as this
great goodness, which is omnipresent, omniscient, omnipotent, ready and
willing to guide, to bless, and to uplift.

To walk with almighty God is to walk with Truth and to affirm the power
of Spirit within mind and body as the dominating mind force; it is to
walk in the light and thus to apply in our daily living the wisdom that
is from above, acknowledging the Father as the source of all our
knowing, as the mainspring of all our actions.

This leads us to the truth that our knowing God brings peace, the serene
abiding that never wearies, never questions, never strains for results.
He created and controls the whole universe. In God "we live, and move,
and have our being."

Mind is the common meeting ground between God and man, and it is only
through the most highly accelerated mind action, as in prayer, that we
can consciously make union with God, the one and only Creator.

Prayer is the language of spirituality and improves the quality of man's
being. Prayer makes man master in the realm of creative ideas. The inner
silence of prayer is a great source of spiritual power. There is no
exception to this rule in all the evidence of life. "Be still, and know
that I am God."

The living Word of God, the creative idea in Divine Mind, may be
expressed by man when he has fulfilled the law of expression. To keep
the Word is to revolve it in mind, to go over it in all its aspects, to
believe in it as Truth, to treasure it as a saving balm in time of need,
and above all, to obey the law it sets forth.

The Christ is God's divine idea of man, the embodiment of all divine
ideas existing in the mind of Being. The Christ is the "Messiah," the
"anointed one." The Christ is the living principle working in man. "Thou
art the Christ, the Son of the living God."

"Know ye not that ye are a temple of God, and that the Spirit of God
dwelleth in you?" Under the direction of the Christ a new body is
constructed by the thinking faculty in man. The materials entering into
this superior structure are spiritual substances, and the new creation
is the body of Spirit. It breathes

<span id="page_11">p. 11</span>

an atmosphere and is thrilled with a life energy more real than that of
the manifest man. When we come into the realization of our true Christ
body we feel the stirring within us of the indwelling Spirit. We know
what Paul meant when he said, "There is a natural body, and there is
also a spiritual body." The true temple in the "body" of Christ is a
state of consciousness. In the inmost center of every man the indwelling
Christ resides.

Would you meet your God in this sacred place? Then quietly enter this
holy of holies in the name and through the power of Jesus Christ. Here
reality reigns supreme. Neither doubt nor fear can enter. You will be
conscious only of the great omnipresence of God, where the light, joy,
peace, and satisfaction of His Spirit abide, where Truth reigns supreme.

In this inner realm you will find the spiritual ethers heavily charged
with ideas that turn to spiritual substance. As your consciousness
(awareness) expands, you touch the everlasting truths and you find that
every blessing is abundantly added. What seems new is but the unveiling
of that which has been forever.

It is of this high realization of oneness with Spirit that Paul wrote in
II Cor. 12:4, when the man was "caught up into Paradise, and heard
unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for man to utter."

In this realm, attention is given to concentrating

<span id="page_12">p. 12</span>

the mind on Truth; the I AM, or inner entity is focalized on God's word
until the inner meaning is realized and man is aware of a definite
spiritual uplift.

Persistent meditation on the Truth contained in the Word of God opens
the mind to a greater inflow of Spirit. Then all words become quickening
life and nourishing substance in both mind and body. "Let the word of
Christ dwell in you richly."

Your thinking Truth zealously and affirming it audibly will dissolve
error in consciousness and at the same time reveal greater spiritual
illumination. In this consciousness appropriate words of Truth. "Eat
them," so to speak. Partake of that with which you form the spiritual
substance and which will manifest itself in the Christ, or perfect body.
Let "Christ be formed in you." Know that the Holy Spirit is filling your
being with its illuminating, resurrecting power and that the all-knowing
One shines in you as it did in Jesus and that you manifest greater and
greater spiritual understanding.

When man praises the Spirit of wisdom within he expands and deepens and
enriches his consciousness. As the Christ radiance lights man's mind, he
sees with the inner eye and he finds that Truth is a never-failing light
that makes straight his way.

In this high state of consciousness he knows that the divine perfection
that exists in the universal God-Mind is brought into direct contact
with its image and likeness, the Christ Spirit that was implanted

<span id="page_13">p. 13</span>

in him by the Creator from the beginning.

The resurrection of Jesus takes place in us each time we rise to the
realization of the perpetual in-dwelling life that connects us with the
Father. The graveclothes of mortal sense, which are thoughts of
limitation and inevitable obedience to material laws, are left in the
tomb of matter.

True resurrection within us lifts up all the faculties of mind until
they conform to the absolute ideas of Divine Mind. This mental renewal
makes a complete transformation of the body, so that every function
works in divine order and every cell becomes incorruptible and immortal.

For the perpetuation or the renewal of youth in mind and body it is well
to affirm often:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Bless Jehovah, O my soul;  
And all that is within me, bless his holy name.  
Bless Jehovah, O my soul,  
And forget not all his benefits:  
Who forgiveth all thine iniquities;  
Who healeth all thy diseases:  
Who redeemeth thy life from destruction;  
Who crowneth thee with lovingkindness and tender mercies;  
Who satisfieth thy desire with good things,  
So that thy youth is renewed like the eagle."
