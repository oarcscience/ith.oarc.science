###  All the Way 

WHEN WE SING, "I'll go with Him all the way," we do not always realize
the mighty import of our words. Jesus went all the way from the human to
the divine. He went all the way to immortality. He raised not only His
own consciousness from despair and hopelessness to assurance and
confidence in the presence and continued help of a loving Father-God,
but He opened the way for the whole race to do likewise. When we
determine to follow Him all the way we undertake the mighty work of the
ages, a revolution of character before which the famous tasks of
Hercules pale into insignificance.

As a matter of fact no one has ever followed Jesus all the way in the
revolution in our race thought that He initiated. Many devout, sincere
men have attempted to do so, but Jesus is yet to be understood and
imitated in His work of salvation.

In the first place we have not understood the depth of our bondage to
error and evil, nor the enormity of the consequences if it is allowed to
continue. But Jesus knew how the human mind wraps itself up in its own
error thought and brings darkness and desolation beyond redemption,
unless the light of divine understanding is released in the
consciousness. Jesus knew how to quicken this inner light by

<span id="page_128">p. 128</span>

being Himself the great Light, and He showed us how to attain the same
spiritual brightness. In the face of ignorance, superstition, and
persecution He boldly proclaimed: "I am the light of the world." "Ye are
the light of the world." "Even so let your light shine before men; that
they may see your good works, and glorify your Father who is in heaven."

To understand Jesus' experiences in their spiritual significance and
their effect on our human bondage we should become better acquainted
with the real character of the man and His relation to us, because the
many claims of Jesus' spiritual superiority made by His followers and
Himself must have a basis of Truth.

That Jesus had elements of greatness far beyond those of any other man
that has ever lived on this earth is universally accepted by both the
religious and the secular world. Some Christians claim that He came
direct from heaven; that He was very God incarnate. Other Christians see
in Him simply the fulfillment of the ideal man designed by Divine Mind.
Neither of these views quite meets the logic of unbiased reason
considered in connection with the events of Jesus' life.

If Jesus was very God and had all power, why did He suffer the agony in
Gethsemane and cry out to His Father for help? If He was a mere man, an
evolved representative of our race, why did He lay claim to an existence
prior and superior to the Jesus incarnation, "And now, Father, glorify
thou me with

<span id="page_129">p. 129</span>

thine own self with the glory which I had with thee before the world
was." "Before Abraham was born, I am."

He claimed the whole human race as His "flock" and compared them to
sheep with Himself as the shepherd:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">I am the good shepherd; and I know mine own, and
mine own  
know me, even as the Father knoweth me, and I know the  
Father; and I lay down my life for the sheep. And other  
sheep have I, which are not of this fold: them also I must  
bring, and they shall hear my voice; and they shall become  
one flock, one shepherd. Therefore doth the Father love me,  
because I lay down my life, that I may take it again. No  
one taketh it away from me, but I lay it down of myself. I  
have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it  
again. This commandment received I from my Father.  
</span>

</div>

But they did not understand. "There arose a division again among the
Jews because of these words. And many of them said, He hath a demon, and
is mad; why hear ye him? Others said, These are not the sayings of one
possessed with a demon. Can a demon open the eyes of the blind?"

Men in Jesus' time could not understand how what appeared to be an
ordinary man could be the beginning of a whole new race of men as Jesus
claimed to be. So they thought He was crazy when He made the assertion.
We in our day do not fully understand how one man and one woman increase
their species. It is a divine mystery, yet we bear witness to it.

<span id="page_130">p. 130</span>

In the 1st chapter of John's Gospel it is written: "He was in the world,
and the world was made through him, and the world knew him not. He came
unto his own, and they that were his own received him not."

The fact is that the relationship which Jesus bears to the human family
is quite beyond our present intellectual comprehension.

In order to understand the status of Jesus we have to visualize a
universe like that in which we live as having existed during billions of
years in the past, as having fulfilled its mission in the evolution of a
superrace of men, and as then passing away leaving as its fruit God-men
with creative power. Jesus was one of the God-men of that ancient
creation, and it was His destiny to bring forth from the depths of Being
a race of potential gods, place them in an environment where they could
grow as He grew and become, like Him, a Son of God. As stated by Paul,
"we are also his offspring."

The beginning of our race evolution is given in the allegory of Adam and
Eve in the Garden of Eden. Jehovah is Christ, who formed man out of the
dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life.

When the Adamic race reached a point in their evolution where they had
personal-will volition, they began to think and act independently of the
Jehovah or Christ Mind. Then the sense consciousness began to rule and
the materialization of the body resulted.

<span id="page_131">p. 131</span>

Degeneration of the whole man followed. Loss of ability to draw
constantly on the one and only source of life threw the whole race into
an anemic condition. Their bodies began to disintegrate, and death came
into the world. Then Satan, the mind of sense, began to rule; sin was in
the saddle. The people like sheep had gone astray; they were lost in the
wilderness of sense; they were in the throes of race extinction. New
life had to be imparted; a blood transfusion was imperative. Christ then
began a series of physical incarnations, beginning prehistorically and
ending with His Jesus incarnation.

Why does the all-powerful God have to resort to the limitations of law
to attain creative ends? We can only reply that there is no evidence
anywhere in nature that any end has ever been accomplished except
through the work of law. As men make civil laws and enforce them with
penalties, even to death, so the human race has formed laws of physical
birth and death, laws of sickness and physical inability, laws making
food the source of bodily existence, laws of mind recognizing no other
source of existence except the physical, the material.

The total of these race laws has formed a race consciousness separate
from and independent of creative Mind, and when that Mind sought to help
men spiritually, the mind of the flesh opposed it and made every effort
to solve its problems in its own way.

The way of the flesh always proved futile and

<span id="page_132">p. 132</span>

disastrous because of human selfishness and greed.

Thus it became absolutely necessary for Christ, the Father of us all, to
make closer contact with our physical or fleshly consciousness and pour
into it a new life current. So Christ Himself, the Jehovah of the Old
Testament, incarnated in Jesus and brought to our immediate attention
both spiritually and physically the abundant life of primal being,
Elohim God. Hence the proclamation of Christ in Jesus, "I came that they
may have life, and may have it abundantly."

Modern scientists explain that the atoms that build molecules, cells,
and tissues are composed of electrical units; that these units seem to
contain the elements that convey life to all creation; that the cells of
our body are energized by these life-giving atoms; and that the ether
filling all space is heavily charged with this life-giving electricity.
Science does not say that this omnipresent energy is divine life, nor
does it admit that it is moved by mind, either divine or human. But
spiritual discernment reveals that there is but one life and one
intelligence penetrating and permeating man and the universe and that
where there is evidence of life there is evidence of Being. Consequently
the life-giving atom is the life-giving God, whom we conceive according
to our degree of spiritual unfoldment.

If we have developed the mind of the Spirit, we see and feel the
quickening life of the energy at the center of the atoms of our body.
All spiritual concepts

<span id="page_133">p. 133</span>

begin in the mind and are translated into atomic life in the body. Here
we have the point of contact between the Christ life and the race life.
It also explains why our life as a people was no longer receiving the
energy flow from the parent stream. Like the prodigal son, we had gone
into a country far from the Father, and there was a famine in that land.
We were starving for the divine substance and got no satisfaction out of
the husks, the food of the swine.

Because of the gulf between the Mind of Being and the sense mind of the
race, no life flow was possible. Then Christ incarnate in the flesh
through Jesus offered His body as a life or electrical transformer. The
atomic units of His body were sundered and sown as points of life and
light in our mind and body atmosphere, to the end that anyone who
concentrates his thoughts on Christ in faith will attract as a spiritual
magnet one or many of His body atoms. These Christ atoms, appropriated
by the individual, become food and drink and form the nucleus of a
regenerated body for the person appropriating them.

This casting forth of His life and body for the regeneration of His
people is promised in the use of the bread and wine as symbols, in the
Last Supper, as described in the 26th chapter of Matthew. "And as they
were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed, and brake it; and he gave to
the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is my body. And he took a cup,
and

<span id="page_134">p. 134</span>

gave thanks, and gave to them, saying, Drink ye all of it; for this is
my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many unto remission of
sins."

Thus Jesus gave His life and body substance as a kind of blood
transfusion to a dying race, and the agony in Gethsemane was the
contemplation of the wrenching of the central ego of the trillions of
living electrons, protons, atoms, molecules, and cells composing His
organism. Thus the body and life elements of the Christ body were sown
as seed in the soil of our race mind, and it is our privilege to
appropriate and incorporate these precious elements into our mind and
body.

The body of Christ Jesus is not to be subject to permanent
disintegration and death; in the creative processes of God it must be
made part of our redeemed body and restored to its parent source, the
Christ. As He said, "Therefore doth the Father love me, because I lay
down my life, that I may take it again."

Here also we have made clear the mystery of salvation through the blood
of Christ. It is not a miracle nor a personal sacrifice, but a meeting
of a crisis in the race evolution by the transfusion of life from a
Father to His perishing children. Understanding this in the sense of its
scientific reality should make us every one more energetic in taking
advantage of our only means of escape from the ills of the flesh and
insuring our ultimate salvation. "Pray that ye enter not into
temptation" is translated by

<span id="page_135">p. 135</span>

Fenton, "Pray, for fear trial should overtake you." The same idea is
brought out in the Lord's Prayer, which in the King James Version reads,
"Lead us not into temptation," but which, according to good authorities
should be, "You would not lead us into temptation, nor forsake us in
trial." The petition is for strength to overcome trial.

As Paul so tellingly wrote to the Philippians: "Finally, brethren,
whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honorable, whatsoever
things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are
lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue,
and if there be any praise, think on these things."

The Lenten Lessons

<span id="page_138">p. 138</span>

Lent

THE WORD LENT comes from the Anglo-Saxon word for spring, which is
derived from a verb meaning to lengthen. Lent comes in the spring when
the days become noticeably longer.

This annual season of fasting, prayer, and penitence has been observed
by the Western Church since the first century after Christ, although it
has not always been forty days long. In more recent times it has been
kept forty days, after the example of Moses and Elijah, and to
commemorate the forty days of fasting and prayer that Jesus spent in the
wilderness.

The first day of Lent is called Ash Wednesday from the custom that
prevailed in the early Church of sprinkling ashes on the heads of
penitents on the first day of Lent, in token of repentance for sin.

Ash Wednesday comes forty-six days before Easter. There are six Sundays
in Lent, and they are not considered part of Lent, because in the
Western Church Sunday is always a feast day. The forty weekdays
beginning with Ash Wednesday constitute Lent.

The fifth Sunday in Lent is known as Passion Sunday, because it marks
the beginning of Passion-tide, the last two weeks of Lent. These two
weeks specifically commemorate the Passion of Jesus, or His experiences
following the Last Supper.

The last week of Lent is called Holy Week. It includes Palm Sunday,
Maundy Thursday, and Good Friday.

<span id="page_139">p. 139</span>

Palm Sunday, the Sunday before Easter, commemorates Jesus' entrance into
Jerusalem when the people strewed palms in His way.

Maundy Thursday, the Thursday before Easter, is a corruption of the
Latin word mandati meaning "of the commandment," and refers to the
command "This do in remembrance of me" spoken by Jesus in regard to His
breaking of the bread and drinking of the wine at the Last Supper.
Maundy Thursday commemorates the event of the Last Supper.

Good Friday, the Friday before Easter, probably known originally as
God's Friday, commemorates the crucifixion of Jesus.

Easter Day, of course, commemorates the Resurrection. The word Easter
comes from the Anglo-Saxon word Eastre, the name of the Goddess of
spring, in whose honor a festival was celebrated each April. Easter Day
always comes on the first Sunday after the full moon that occurs on or
after March 21. If the full moon falls on a Sunday, Easter is the next
Sunday. Easter can never fall earlier than March 22 nor later than April
25.

Lent is a season of spiritual growth, a time for progressive unfoldment.
When we can blend and merge our mind with God-Mind, the way is open for
the Lord to glorify us and to lift us into a higher, purer, more
spiritual state.

"Where two or three are gathered together in

<span id="page_140">p. 140</span>

my name, there am I in the midst of them," said Jesus. Unity students
everywhere are invited to participate yearly in our Lenten program.
Christ is in our midst, as the God of our planet, as the one great
Teacher. Place all burdens on the Lord and enter the Lenten season
expecting definite results.

Fasting means abstaining from; it is abstinence. The place of overcoming
is in the consciousness of man. The forty-day fast is an all-round
denial of sense demands. In fasting, we as metaphysicians abstain from
error thinking and meditate on spiritual Truth until we incorporate it
into the consciousness of oneness with the Father.

The desire to excel is in all men. It is the inspiration of the Holy
Spirit, which ever urges us on through earth toward heaven. It should be
encouraged and cultivated in the right direction.

As day after day we steadily adhere to our firm resolve to follow the
steps outlined for the Lenten season, we discover that we are building
on a firm foundation, and are mounting into a higher consciousness. We
come to know that Christ is indeed with us and is resurrecting in us His
realizations of light, life, and substance.

<span id="page_141">p. 141</span>

Denial

1st Day, Ash Wednesday. Read Matthew 5:1-16.

Ash Wednesday, the first day of Lent, is so-called from the ceremonial
of ashes. Ashes symbolize repentance.

John the Baptist came, saying, "Repent ye; for the kingdom of heaven is
at hand." Repentance means denial; it is a relinquishment and should be
made without too much vehemence. Therefore, I deny out of consciousness
old error thoughts, as if I were gently sweeping away cobwebs, and I
affirm positively and fearlessly that I am a child of God, and that my
inheritance is from Him.

As I follow this rule I find that I am letting go of old mortal beliefs
and the Divine within is flaming higher and higher. Its pure white light
is infusing all my surroundings with a delightful spirit of wisdom,
dignity, and peace. I realize more and more the law of righteous
thinking that is bringing me into a consciousness of my perfect
dominion.

In Christ it is not difficult to eliminate belief in strife and
contention. If petty quarrels, jealousy, uncharitable thoughts come into
my life, I overcome them by a quiet but positive denial made in the
realization that no error has any power or reality in itself. I turn
away from the belief in negation, and my thinking changes. I rid my
consciousness of limited thoughts that have encumbered and darkened my
understanding. I break down mortal

<span id="page_142">p. 142</span>

thought and ascend into a spiritual realm, the kingdom of the heavens.

In the spirit of divine love I affirm: "Forgetting the things that are
behind, I realize I am strong, positive, powerful, wise, loving,
fearless, free spirit. I am God's perfect child."

Affirmation

2d Day, Thursday. Read Luke 7:1-17.

The science of Spirit is the orderly study of truths formulated in
Divine Mind according to the operation of universal law. An affirmation
is a positive and orderly statement of Truth. By affirmation we claim
and appropriate that which is ours.

The Word is the working power of Divine Mind. One will never go down to
defeat if in his hour of need he positively affirms the almightiness of
God-Mind through Christ, and invokes its help in his behalf.

I declare that as a child of God I am now entering the Christ
consciousness of perfection. This is in itself an affirmation, the
highest I can make. Jesus helped Himself into this high state of being
by His use of the spoken word. He continually made the very highest
affirmations such as, "I and the Father are one," "All authority hath
been given unto me in heaven and on earth." I am joint heir with Jesus
to the infinite good of the kingdom, and by the faithful use of my
spoken word I claim my heavenly good.

<span id="page_143">p. 143</span>

Faith is the result of many affirmations. Each affirmation helps to
build up a substantial, firm, unwavering state of mind, because it
establishes Truth in consciousness.

As day by day I repeat and courageously live affirmations of Truth, I
come to know that I am opening a channel of intelligent communication
with the silent forces at the depths of being; thoughts and words
therefrom flow forth, and I realize an entirely new source of power
developing within me.

I affirm: "Through Jesus Christ I realize my divine sonship, and I am
transformed into His image and likeness."

God

3d Day, Friday. Read John 15:1-16.

"God is Spirit: and they that worship him must worship in spirit and
truth." We do not see God with our physical eyes excepting as He
manifests Himself through His works. His attributes are therefore
brought into expression by man who is His son and who is like Him in
essence. Jesus was a true expression of God because He was like Him. If
we would manifest the divine attributes, we must seek to attain the
consciousness and the understanding that characterized Jesus. We must
endeavor to raise our thoughts and feelings to God's level if we would
make ourselves channels through which

<span id="page_144">p. 144</span>

He can come forth into expression and manifestation.

God transcendent suggests God as above and beyond His creation. This
idea of God as remote from the practical affairs of man or from man's
own experience is false. God (perfection) is not out of reach of His
offspring nor something beyond or above them. Tennyson tells us that
"closer is He than breathing, and nearer than hands and feet."

I am centered in God because I focus my attention on His ideas and
ideals. The Holy Spirit, which is the Word of God in action, leads me
into a consciousness of my divine sonship and inheritance. My
inheritance from Him is executive ability, abundant supply,
faithfulness, joy, all good. "I am thy portion and thine inheritance."

In the name of Jesus Christ I declare: "God's perfect plan of bodily
perfection is bearing fruit, and I am made whole."

I AM

4th Day, Saturday. Read John 10:1-18.

I am a child of the Father, and my inheritance is from Him. I AM is the
Christ within me, the true spiritual being, whom God made in His image
and likeness. Through the I AM (the Christ), I link myself with the
Father, with Spirit, with life, wisdom, love, peace, strength, power,
and Truth.

I AM is the gate through which my thoughts

<span id="page_145">p. 145</span>

come forth from the invisible, and it is through this gate that I go to
get into the presence of Spirit.

The I AM has its being in heaven; its home is in the realm of God
ideals. I hitch my I AM to the star of God, and infinite joy follows as
night the day.

The I AM always assures me that the preponderance of power is in
spiritual things. Fear throws dust in one's eyes and hides the mighty
spiritual forces that are always with one. I deny ignorance and fear,
and affirm the presence and power of the I AM. "I AM THAT I AM . . . I
AM hath sent me unto you."

I realize that spiritual character is the rock foundation of being. As I
build my consciousness in God-Mind, I find that I am in heaven right
here on earth. I let go of the little self and take hold of the big
self. "Not my will, but thine, be done." The I AM is the will in its
highest aspect. The will may be said to be the man, because it is the
directive power that decides the character formation which makes what is
called individuality.

I boldly affirm: "I am a child of God, and I am joint heir with Jesus to
abiding life, wisdom, love, peace, substance, strength, and power."

The Altar

1st Sunday. Read Matthew 5:21-26.

The altar represents a fixed, definite center in the consciousness of
man. It is a place within where

<span id="page_146">p. 146</span>

we meet the Lord face to face and are willing to give up our sins, give
up the lower for the higher, the personal for the impersonal, the animal
for the divine.

The altar, mentioned in Revelation 11:1 symbolizes the consciousness of
full consecration that takes place in the temple of worship, the body.
"Present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which
is your spiritual service."

The altar to the unknown God is a yearning to know the unrevealed
Spirit, and a reaching out of the mind for a fuller realization of its
source.

Prayer does not change God--it changes us. Sincere desire is a form of
prayer. Deep desire is essential for spiritual growth. It is
desire--earnest, intense desire--that draws the whole being up out of
mortality and its transient joys into the power to appreciate and
receive real spiritual blessings. This is a demonstration, the proving
of a Truth principle in one's body and affairs. It is the manifestation
of an ideal when its accomplishment has been brought about by one's
conformity in thought, word, and act, to the creative principle of God.

Kneeling at the altar I take my statement of Truth and hold it steadily
in mind until I get my realization, the logic of my mind is satisfied,
and there is the lifting up and expanding of soul consciousness.

To this end I affirm: "It is not I, 'but the Father abiding in me doeth
his works.'"
