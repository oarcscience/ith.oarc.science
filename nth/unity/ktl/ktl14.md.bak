###  Conscious Mind and Subconscious Mind Chapter 12 

WE ARE ALL well acquainted with the conscious mind. Through its use we
establish our relations with the outer realm and recognize our
individual entities. Indeed, there are some who claim that the conscious
mind is the only mind there is. They are simply holding a thus far
undiscovered country to be undiscoverable. Of such persons as these
Cardinal Newman spoke when he said that they "are only possessed by
their knowledge, not possessed of it." But in due season they will awake
and respond to the call of Spirit to "come up higher."

The subconscious mind is the vast, silent realm that lies back of the
conscious mind and between it and the superconscious. To one who does
not understand its nature and its office, it is the "great gulf fixed"
between his present state and the attainment of his highest desire, his
good. The subconscious may be called the sensitive plate of mind. Its
true office is to receive impressions from the superconscious and to
reproduce them upon the canvas of the conscious mind. Man, however,
having lost the consciousness of the indwelling Father as an ever
present reality, has reversed the process and impresses the subconscious

<span id="page_88">p. 88</span>

from the conscious mind. In this way the former is made to register
impressions of both good and evil, according to the thought held in
conscious mind at the time the impression is made. And since it is the
purpose and the nature of the subconscious mind to reproduce, or to
throw upon the screen of the conscious, the exact impression that it has
received, the conscious mind is thus made to express two sets of
opposing ideas. No enduring structure can be built by one who is "a
double-minded man, unstable in all his ways."

Man must go back to his Source and let its clear light flood his whole
being with Truth. He must lay aside forever the idea of serving two
masters and must look to the one Master, even Christ, the spiritual
consciousness within. Jesus said that He came not to destroy the law,
but that the law might be fulfilled through Him. It is the mission of
every man born into the world to fulfill the law of Being; one can do
this work only by working from cause to effect.

"Be subject therefore unto God . . . Draw nigh to God, and he will draw
nigh to you." It is a comfort to know that we do not have to make the
entire journey alone back to the Father. We read that when the prodigal
son was coming back to his father, "while he was yet afar off, his
father saw him, and was moved with compassion, and ran, and fell on his
neck, and kissed him."

The superconscious mind is ever ready to pour

<span id="page_89">p. 89</span>

forth the divine blessing, quick to respond to the call of the
conscious, which it meets on the middle ground of the subconscious.
Spirit is omnipresent, but man has hedged himself about by a world of
illusion of his own creating, and through its mists he cannot see the
Father, or catch the light from the superconscious mind. Jesus came to
give us conscious control of the intelligence and the power necessary to
dispel these mists, in order that "the true light, even the light which
lighteth every man, coming into the world," might shine full upon us.
Thus we see that the superconsciousness sends its rays of intelligence
and power first into the consciousness, and that through their influence
man is led to seek the kingdom within, where all things are added to
him.

The superconscious mind lifts up, or regenerates, both the subconscious
and the conscious, transforming them into the true image and likeness of
God. The conscious mind must be faithful during this transformation. It
must look ever to the superconscious for all direction and instruction.
It can of itself do nothing with assurance, because the Spirit of wisdom
rests in the superconscious.

The subconscious exists for the benefit of the conscious mind, but
unless regenerated it thwarts the efforts of the conscious at every
step, so that "ye may not do the things that ye would."

The subconsciousness is sometimes called memory. One whose subconscious
mind has not been systematically trained, or awakened, is often heard

<span id="page_90">p. 90</span>

to say that he has "a poor memory." Sometimes he tries to recall a word
or a name that he knows "as well as he knows anything," but he cannot
speak it. Several days later, perhaps, when there is no longer any
desire to recall it, the word "comes to him." The subconsciousness has
reproduced it, but the process has been slow.

The subconscious mind can be trained by the conscious to work
systematically and reliably, but the conscious mind must be faithful and
consistent in creating the impressions that it seeks to make upon the
subconscious.

For five years after learning typewriting a stenographer used the sight
method. Then the advantages of the touch system (typing without looking
at the keys) were impressed upon her and she desired to learn that
system. At first she did not believe that she could do it, because she
was so "used to the other way" and was engaged in active work, with no
time for practice. But the desire continued, and before long an
opportunity came. She obtained a different position, where there was
leisure for practice. She had daily association with an enthusiastic
student of the touch system and she was encouraged in every way. For
about six months she devoted her conscious mind to remembering the
keyboard and to controlling the movements of her fingers. Eventually the
subconscious mind was so impressed with a knowledge of the right
movements and the right positions of the fingers that it regulated them
of itself.

<span id="page_91">p. 91</span>

"Thought is quicker than vision" was her motto during the tedium of
practice, and she has proved it to be true. If she strikes the wrong key
she knows it instantly without having to look at her work, and she has
been heard to say that her fingers express her thoughts much better than
her tongue, because they have had so much attention and such persistent
drill. Of course, the fingers can do nothing of themselves, because mind
is the only actuating power.

The subconscious mind is also known as the heart, and the many
references to it in the Bible show that its nature and its office were
well understood by the writers of Scripture. "Keep thy heart with all
diligence; For out of it are the issues of life," indicates the
importance of the proper development of the subconscious mind. Man
cannot, however, keep his heart, or control the expressions from his
subconscious mind, without the aid of Spirit. The superconsciousness
reaches to the depths of the subconscious and sets free the energies
bound in error thought; that having been done, man can easily reach and
mold the subconscious, in harmony with divine ideas. The regeneration of
the subconscious is not the work of the conscious, but of the
superconscious mind acting in harmony with the conscious.

The Spirit of God, speaking through Ezekiel, commands, "Cast away from
you all your transgressions, wherein ye have transgressed; and make you
a new heart and a new spirit." This command is to the conscious man, or
mind. But later the Spirit of

<span id="page_92">p. 92</span>

God says, "A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put
within you," thus signifying that the whole mind must be embraced in the
regeneration. There must be perfect co-operation of the three phases of
mind in order to produce the perfect man. "I, Jehovah, search the mind,
I try the heart, even to give every man according to his ways, according
to the fruit of his doings." "Purify your hearts, ye double-minded,"
says James. We purify our heart when we turn conscious attention within
and the pure ideas of the superconscious mind come forth to meet our
call. "He that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit." When we seek the
superconsciousness and make conscious connection with it we harmonize
all the forces of mind and body; we lift up the subconscious until a
complete, conscious unification of the three phases of mind is affected
and we become established "in singleness of . . . heart." We can say
with the Psalmist, "His heart is fixed, trusting in Jehovah." We fear
nothing, for we know that we draw on the divine ideas in God-Mind and
that they all are good.
