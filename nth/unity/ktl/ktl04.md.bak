###  The Holy Trinity the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit Chapter 2 

THE HOLY TRINITY is known as the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
Metaphysically, we understand the Trinity to refer to mind, idea, and
expression, or thinker, thought, and action.

God is first in the Trinity. God is mind and is everywhere present. God
is principle, law, Being, Spirit, All-Good, omnipotent, omniscient,
omnipresent, unchangeable, Creator, Father, cause, and source of all
that is. God as Spirit is forever accessible.

God as principle is the unchangeable life, love, substance, and
intelligence of Being. A parallel may be found in the principle of
mathematics or music. Principle does not occupy space, nor has it any
limitations of time or matter, but eternally exists as the one
underlying cause from which come forth all true ideas.

In universal God-Mind is a substance that includes the seed of all
visible substance. It is the only real substance, because it is
unchangeable, while visible substance is in constant transition. God as
substance does not mean matter, because matter is formed; God is
formless. The substance that God is lies back of all matter and all
form. It is that which

<span id="page_15">p. 15</span>

is the basis of all form, yet enters not into any form as finality. It
cannot be seen, tasted, or touched, yet it is the one and only
"substantial" substance.

Second in the Trinity is God's idea of man. It is called Jehovah in the
Old Testament and Christ in the New Testament. The second in the Trinity
is also called the Word, the Son, the Logos, the anointed One, and the I
AM.

The Word of God is the revelation to man of the powers and possibilities
of his own being. The searchlight of His Word discloses the presence of
secret springs and living streams of energy and life. Man's
consciousness is lifted up by the wisdom of the Word, and he finds
himself master of the powers and privileges of infinity. He says with
Jesus, "All authority hath been given unto me in heaven and on earth."

To produce works, there must be a working power. This is exactly what
the Word is--the working power of God.

Every known process has a regular sequence from inception to conclusion,
and each step in the sequence is taken according to recognized
principles. The Word of God conveys to the world the concepts of the
Most High.

Persistent meditation on the Truth contained in the Word of God opens
the mind to Spirit. Then all words become quickening life and nourishing
substance in both mind and body. "Let the word of Christ dwell in you
richly."

<span id="page_16">p. 16</span>

In the silence go before the altar and lay your problems before the
Lord. The altar is that place in consciousness where you are willing to
let go of the lesser for the greater, to let go of personality and enter
into individuality of the Christ.

While in this closet of prayer, fix your mind powerfully on the
consummation of a certain idea until the idea nucleates a certain amount
of thought substance. This is followed by a spiritual quickening, or the
outpouring of the Holy Spirit, third in the Trinity.

The function of the Holy Spirit implies distinct personal subsistence:
He speaks, searches, selects, reveals, reproves, testifies, leads,
comforts, distributes to every man, "searcheth all things, yea, the deep
things of God."

In concentration the Holy Spirit works through the divine substance to
bring forth the fruits of Divine Mind. The Holy Spirit is the teacher.
The teacher and the student use the same principles; but the teacher
arouses and inspires the student to greater achievement. The Holy Spirit
today is urging us to greater spiritual effort.

Another word for the Holy Spirit is "the Comforter," Jesus said:
"Nevertheless I tell you the truth: It is expedient for you that I go
away; for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if
I go, I will send him unto you. And he, when he is come, will convict
the world in respect of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment."

<span id="page_17">p. 17</span>

The mission of Jesus was to open the way for the Holy Spirit to enter
into the minds of men. "But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send
unto you from the Father, even the Spirit of truth, which proceedeth
from the Father, he shall bear witness of me."

We may understand the relation and office of the Father, the Son, and
the Holy Spirit by analyzing our own mind and its apparent subdivisions
during thought action, because each person is a perfect image and
likeness of this great universal first cause--God, the Father.

Your word is the power through which you make your belief manifest.
Simple belief in or assent to the truth of a proposition never gives
understanding to anyone. There must be mental action; changes in the
mind are necessary before the new state of consciousness takes up its
abode in you.

Therefore, in answer to that frequently asked question, "Who is the Holy
Spirit, and what relation does it bear to God and to Christ?" the
apostles knew the Holy Spirit as the third person of the Trinity. The
Father is always the first, the Son or Word second, and the Holy Spirit
third. The terms Father and Son express an eternal, reciprocal relation.
The Holy Spirit is the infinite "breath" of God, as the Son of His
infinite "Word."

God-Mind is located and appears wherever it is recognized by the mind of
man. It thus follows that whoever gives his attention to Spirit and
seals his

<span id="page_18">p. 18</span>

identification with it by his word (the Son) starts a flow of Spirit
life and all the attributes of Spirit in and through his consciousness.
To the extent that he practices identifying himself with the one and
only source of existence, he becomes Spirit in expression, until finally
the union attains a perfection in which he can say with Jesus, "I and
the Father are one."

In making your demonstrations, work for the conviction in your own heart
that you are a son of God; next, declare it in word and carry it out in
the acts of your daily life. After declaring it, if you fail in
demonstrating yourself to be a son of God, determine why. "Ask, and it
shall be given you . . . knock, and it shall be opened unto you."
Perhaps you have neglected some of your spiritual powers, or you may be
dissipating your energies on the sense plane.

Be that as it may, when you ask in the silence of Spirit to be shown why
you do not demonstrate the powers that Jesus of Nazareth demonstrated,
the Holy Spirit will in some way reveal to you your lack. How that
revealment will come about, no one can tell you. But if you are patient
and trustful, you will be guided and directed so that all the links in
the chain of your being will be brought together and harmoniously
joined, and the Son of God will be revealed in you.
