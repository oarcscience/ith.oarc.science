###  God's Abundance 

TIMES OF DEPRESSION bring out the fact that in days of prosperity man
either forgot the prayers and struggles that brought him to success and
apparent safety, or else he failed to build his fortune on a firm
financial foundation. If he had thought more about the source of life
and substance, he would have escaped the needless grind of the poverty
he has endured right here in the midst of abundance.

There is both a primary and a secondary law of increase. Men pile up
possessions by human effort, interest, and other ways of secondary
increase, and grow into the thought that these are the real means of
attaining prosperity. But possessions gained in this way rest on a very
insecure foundation and are often swept away in a day. Then men are in
despair and often think that their means of existence is gone forever
and life is not worth living. Such persons are really never happy in
their wealth, because there is always a lurking fear that they may lose
it. They are secretly troubled with the thought of lack, in the presence
of worldly plenty.

We cannot help but think that a wise and provident Creator must have
planned more permanent possessions for His offspring. In Truth, He has
so planned. Access to this permanent source of all man's

<span id="page_102">p. 102</span>

good lies in his power to possess and mold in thought the omnipresent
substance of Spirit.

Apparently we live in two worlds: an invisible world of thoughts, and a
visible world of things. The invisible world of thought substance is the
real world, because it is the source of the world of things, and man
stands between the two, handing out with his thoughts the unlimited
substance of Spirit. When man gets understanding of the right relation
between the visible and the invisible into his mind and active in his
thought, all his needs will be met. That is what Jesus meant when He
said, "Seek ye first his kingdom, and his righteousness; and all these
things shall be added unto you."

But the invisible thought substance provided for man is very sensitive
to man's thought about it; that is, about the things that originally
came from it and that man claims as his possessions. If man hoards the
things that he seems to possess, he clogs the spiritual channel from
which they originally flowed and so receives sparingly from that source.

Watch your thoughts when you are handling your money, because your money
is attached through your mind to the one source of all substance and all
money. When you think of your money, which is visible, as something
directly attached to an invisible source that is giving or withholding
according to your thought, you have the key to all riches and the reason
for all lack.

Paul had a consciousness of this law of thought

<span id="page_103">p. 103</span>

in finances when he wrote to the Corinthians, "He that soweth sparingly
shall reap also sparingly; and he that soweth bountifully shall reap
also bountifully."

This law of the mind affecting resources applies especially to those who
are responsible for the temporal needs of the family, because they are
seriously interested and put actual thought substance into the monetary
income and outgo. Children and those who have not labored to gain money
put very little thought substance into it or its spiritual idea. But the
heads of families need thought discipline in raising the prosperity
consciousness, because the law is no respecter of persons and millions
of good people, the very salt of the earth, are in want the world over
because they do not know this law of sowing and reaping in thought. The
financial field is a large one, and we are all sowing and reaping in it
every day. The financial genius deals in large transactions because he
has large ideas of supply.

God, being the giver of inexhaustible ideas of plenty, loves those who
abandon themselves to a cheerful state of mind so that He may pour more
abundance into their thoughts. Then Paul says, "God is able to make all
grace abound unto you; that ye, having always all sufficiency in
everything, may abound unto every good work."

The thought behind a gift is the real measure of its value and
efficiency. Jesus illustrated this when He called the attention of His
disciples to the poor

<span id="page_104">p. 104</span>

widow who cast two mites into the treasury, which was large in her
estimation because it represented all her living. It is what we think
about our gift that gives it spiritual value and not the stamp on the
coin. This is illustrated by the story about the careless Scot who
tossed a crown, thinking it a penny, into the collection plate, and when
he saw his mistake asked to have it back. The deacon refused, and the
Scot grunted, "Aweel, aweel, I'll get credit for it in heaven." "Na,
na," responded the deacon, "ye'll get credit for the penny."

It is easy to forget that God is the source of our supply, so we have
our days of thanksgiving and our grace at table, besides the discipline
of acknowledging the supreme Giver of all good whenever we receive or
pay out money. The practice of tithing is undoubtedly the most expansive
practice in this respect, and thousands of successful businessmen use it
to their continuous financial and spiritual profit.

Jacob began tithing very early in his successful career. "Of all that
thou shalt give me," he vowed to Jehovah, "I will surely give the tenth
unto thee." Tithing for the support of his religion was incumbent on
every Israelite, and of all the races of the earth none other has
equaled the Israelites in financial ability.

Metaphysical insight reveals why the Jews have always been noted for
their prosperity. By the act of tithing, men make God their partner in
their financial

<span id="page_105">p. 105</span>

transactions and thus keep the channel open from the source in the ideal
to the manifestation in the realm of things. Whoever thinks that he is
helping to keep God's work going in the earth cannot help but believe
that God will help him. This virtually makes God not only a silent
partner but also active in producing capital from unseen and unknown
sources, in opening up avenues for commercial gain, and in various other
ways making the individual prosperous.

That the law works for those who persist in its application is beyond
question. But nearly all who practice tithing confess that in certain
stages of their prosperity they fall into the error set forth in
Deuteronomy: "Beware lest thou forget Jehovah . . . when . . . thy
silver and thy gold is multiplied, and all that thou hast is multiplied;
then thy heart be lifted up, and thou forget Jehovah thy God . . . lest
thou say in thy heart, My power and the might of my hand hath gotten me
this wealth. But thou shalt remember Jehovah thy God, for it is he that
giveth thee power to get wealth."

We give money a dignity that does not belong to it. Money and those who
possess money are looked on as wielding a certain power, and we give
them deference that in no wise belongs to them. The foundation of this
is fear; we fear the power of those who use money to their own ends.

Various plans have been proposed to rob money of its power--or the power
that men have given it--

<span id="page_106">p. 106</span>

the idea being that money is responsible for the abuses that have grown
up through its use. But the destruction of money will not cure the evils
that have come into being in the name of money. It is not money, but the
love of money, that is the root of all evil. What men need to know is
that money represents a mind substance of unlimited abundance and
accessibility; that this mind substance cannot safely be hoarded or
selfishly used by anyone; that it is a living magnet attracting good of
every kind to those who possess it; that those who train their thoughts
to depend on this mind substance for supply of all kinds never lack.
When there is a need, they simply sing and pray and praise and give
thanks that their need is bountifully supplied. If the mind is free from
attachment to money or love of it, and lovingly concentrated on the
divine substance, there is never failure in the demonstration.

"Because thou servedst not Jehovah thy God with joyfulness, and with
gladness of heart, by reason of the abundance of all things; therefore
shalt thou serve thine enemies that Jehovah shall send against thee, in
hunger, and in thirst, and in nakedness, and in want of all things."

This was the admonition of Moses to the Children of Israel, and it holds
good to this day. Making a living is a species of slavery to most
persons. To them God is a slave driver, and they are continually under
the lash of their own thoughts of how hard it is to make a living. Life
to them is just one task after

<span id="page_107">p. 107</span>

another without any hope of finding rest and peace.

This certainly is not the destiny planned by an all-powerful and
all-loving Father for His children. When we groan and sweat under the
stress and strain of life, we are serving Satan instead of God. The
satanic consciousness would make us believe that there is a limited
amount of the things necessary to life and that we must labor hard to
get our share. It is true that such conditions do come upon those who
have turned their faces from God. "In the sweat of thy face shalt thou
eat bread."

However, those who follow Jesus in the worship of the loving Father
escape the effects of the curse of the serpent and are restored to the
liberty of the sons of God.

All work becomes divine for man when he affirms that he is working for
God and that God is a generous paymaster. Then joy and gladness of heart
will automatically spring up in the soul "by reason of the abundance of
all things." This means that when we praise God and give thanks for His
supply and support we open our mind to the inflow of the abundant
spiritual essence of all things.

Jesus said that before we can enter the kingdom of the heavens we must
become as little children. Most children are bubbling over with
happiness. They have not yet been taught how to take life in the
serious, solemn manner of the average adult. They hop and they skip and
they sing, and their daily needs are met.

<span id="page_108">p. 108</span>

We all look back on the joys and freedom of our childhood and wish that
they might have lasted always. And why not?

We have been taught that in mature life we have many hard lessons to
learn, that trials and tribulations are an essential part of man's life,
and that we must experience them in order to develop our character; that
is, our consciousness. But Jesus said we must become as little children
before we can enter the kingdom of heaven and that the kingdom is within
us.

The little child has no consciousness of the tribulations of life, and
the logical conclusion is that when we unload false states of mind and
become childlike we shall begin to realize what heaven is like.

"'For your Father knows your necessities before you ask Him.
Consequently, ye must pray in this way:

"'Our Father in the Heavens; Your Name must be being Hallowed;

"'Your Kingdom must be being restored.

"'Your Will must be being done both in Heaven and upon the Earth.

"'Give us to-day our to-morrow's bread;

"'And forgive us our faults, as we forgive those offending us, for You
would not lead us into temptation, but deliver us from its evil.'"

This translation of the Lord's Prayer is found in "The Complete Bible in
Modern English," by Ferrar Fenton.

<span id="page_109">p. 109</span>

In a footnote to this translation Mr. Fenton says:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">The above is the literal translation of the original
Greek,  
retaining the Greek moods and tenses by the clearest  
English I could. The old versions, having been made from a  
Latin translation, could not reproduce the actual sense of  
the Saviour as given by the Evangelists, for Latin has no  
Aorist of the imperative passive mood used by Matthew and  
Luke.  
The force of the imperative first Aorist seems to me to be  
that of what is called a standing order, a thing to be done  
absolutely, and continuously.  
Ferrar Fenton says that the Aorist is a tense expressing  
complete action in a single movement. So we see that  
according to the preface of the Lord's Prayer as originally  
given by Jesus, He wants us not to pray for something to be  
done in the future. Instead, since God has already provided  
the things we need before we ask Him, our prayers should be  
in the nature of a command implying our recognition of the  
fact that they are now appearing in our world. As Fenton  
says, the prayer is of the nature of a standing order, "a  
thing to be done absolutely, and continuously."  
</span>

</div>

So we see that we are not to beg God to provide for us, implying that He
has been like an improvident parent whom we have to remind of His
remissness. God has provided absolutely and continuously for every need
of man, individually and collectively, and everything belongs to us:
"All things whatsoever the Father hath are mine," said Jesus.
