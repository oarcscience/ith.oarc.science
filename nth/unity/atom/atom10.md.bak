###  Is This God's World? Chapter VIII 

WHY DOESN'T God do something about it?" This oft-repeated query, uttered
by the skeptical and unbelieving, is heard day in and day out. Imitating
the skeptics, Christian believers everywhere are looking to God for all
kinds of reforms in every department of manifest life and also are
charging Him with death and destruction the world over.

One who thinks logically and according to sound reason wonders at the
contradictions set up by these various queries and desires.

Is God responsible for all that occurs on this earth, and if not all,
how much of it?

The Bible states that God created the earth and all its creatures, and
last of all man, to whom He gave dominion over everything. Observation
and experience prove that man is gaining dominion over nature wherever
he applies himself to that end. But so much remains to be gained, and he
is so small physically that man counts himself a pygmy instead of the
mental giant that he is.

All the real mastery that man attains in the world has its roots in his
mind, and when he opens up the mental realm in his being there are no
unattainables. If the conquests of the air achieved in the last quarter
of a century had been prophesied the

<span id="page_64">p. 64</span>

prophets would have been pronounced crazy. The fact is that no one
thinking in the old mind realm can have any conception of the
transformation of sound waves into electromagnetic waves and back again
into words and messages of intelligence. Edison admitted that his
discovery of the phonograph was an accident and that he never fully
understood how mechanical vibrations could be recorded and be reproduced
in all forms of intelligent communication.

Reasoning in terms of matter, no one can understand how words and music
and pictures can be carried over long distances through space without
conflict and then be reproduced by a mechanical device with perfection
and accuracy.

Now that man has broken away from his limited visualizations and
mentally grasped the unhampered ideas of the supermind, he is growing
grandly bold and his technical pioneers are telling him that the
achievements of yesterday are as nothing compared to those of tomorrow.
For example, an article by Harland Manchester condensed in the Reader's
Digest from Scientific American tells of the "micro-waves" that are
slated for a more spectacular career in the realm of the unbelievable
than anything that has preceded them. This article describes in detail
some of the marvels that will evolve out of the utilization of
microwaves, among which may be mentioned "private phone calls by the
hundreds of thousands sent simultaneously over the same wave

<span id="page_65">p. 65</span>

band without wires, poles or cables. Towns where each citizen has his
own radio frequency, over which he can get voice, music, and television,
and call any phone in the country by dialing. Complete abolition of
static and interference from electrical devices and from other stations.
A hundred times as much 'space on the air' as we now have in the
commercial radio band. A high-definition and color television network to
cover the country. And, perhaps most important of all, a nation-wide
radar network, geared to television, to regulate all air traffic and
furnish instantaneous visual weather reports to airfields throughout the
land."

Add to this the marvels promised by the appliers of atomic energy and
you have an array of miracles unequaled in all the bibles of all the
nations of the world.

It is admitted by those who are most familiar with the dynamic power of
these newly discovered forces that we do not yet know how to protect our
body cells from the destructiveness of their vibrations. Very thick
concrete walls are required to protect those who experiment with atomic
forces. One scientist says that the forces released from the bombs that
were used on the Japanese cities in 1945 may affect those who were
subjected to them and their descendants for a thousand years.
Experimentation proves that we have tapped a kingdom that we do not know
how to handle safely.

<span id="page_66">p. 66</span>

It is quite obvious that these forces, if they could be utilized, would
vastly improve our standard of living and that they were planned for us
by creative Mind. If we cannot control them, why did God allow us to
discover them? And now that we are turning them loose in space all about
us, what are we going to do about it? Also how do we reconcile this
situation with the observation of the Psalmist:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Thou makest him to have dominion over the works of
thy  
hands;  
Thou hast put all things under his feet."  
</span>

</div>

The fact is that we have reached a point in race evolution where we are
forced to give attention to the refinement of the body. Our religion has
too long taught that the body is dust and ashes and that it is its
destiny to die and be left to the worms. The deterioration of the body
cells must be arrested and a new and more powerful life force injected
into the physical organism. This is plainly part of the teaching of
Jesus. He said, "I came that they may have life, and may have it
abundantly." He told his followers that when they went to that upper
room in Jerusalem they would receive the baptism of the Holy Spirit with
power. The original Greek says that they would receive dynamic energy.
All baptisms with Spirit impart vitalizing life to the recipient, and
the joy of quickened vitality should be felt and retained as part of the
physical regeneration.

The divine unction imparted by spiritual baptism

<span id="page_67">p. 67</span>

also contains all the healing forces of X rays, ultraviolet rays,
sunshine, and in fact all the radiant restorative forces now so widely
used as healing agents. But the energy imparted by Spirit is so tempered
that it never injures but always heals. That this is not true of the
shocks given by mechanical generators is evidenced by the scars they
often leave. A prayer treatment by an experienced spiritual healer is a
baptism, with power proportioned to the spiritual understanding of the
healer. The lowest method of imparting spiritual baptism is by the
laying on of hands and prayer. The highest is realizing the Holy Spirit
presence and its expression through the power of the word. Jesus began
His ministry by doing the former, but at the end He sent His word and
healed by means of it.

God created the fundamental ideas culminating in the idea of ideal man.
This ideal man has power to mold God's creation into any manifestation
he may choose. If he consults the Father and projects his thoughts in
accordance with the law, perfect manifestation follows. As Jesus said,
"My Father worketh even until now, and I work."

One who understands this relation of man to his creator can assert with
confidence that this is man's world and always will be. By right
thinking man can have the co-operation of God in producing
manifestations and thereby can set up the kingdom of God in the earth;
or he can ignore God and attempt

<span id="page_68">p. 68</span>

to form a world and govern it without divine aid. We are now living in a
civilization dominated by human thought, and confusion is the result.

How many ages and aeons have passed since man lost contact with God no
one can tell. We have about six thousand years of history and no
heavenly conditions are recorded. Caves and sand drifts reveal the
remains of man in combat with the gorilla for half a million years, with
man himself sunk almost to the level of the monkey. When man dropped out
of the ethers and became one of the primates mortal understanding has
not yet discerned, but the distortions in the earth and all nature bear
evidence of a terrible shock.

We know that our home is not altogether on the earth but also in the
air, over which we must gain dominion before we can have a fit dwelling
place. We are now gaining this dominion by mechanical means. This will
be followed by the development of a human organism that, unified with
Spirit, will transport us everywhere in air and on earth.

The great and most important issue before the people today is the
development of man's spiritual mind and through it unity with God. There
seem to be things in more immediate need of being done to alleviate
present conditions, but the taproot of all this confusion is our failure
to use our minds intelligently. We can only think as God would have us
think by adjusting our thoughts to divine ideas. Religion

<span id="page_69">p. 69</span>

and all that it implies in prayer and recognition of God in idea and
manifestation is the one and only way out of the chaos in which we find
ourselves. We must therefore begin at once to develop this unity with
the Father mind by incorporating divine ideas into all that we think and
speak.
