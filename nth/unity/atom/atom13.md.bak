###  The Only Mind Chapter XI 

I SAY, "An idea comes to me." Where did it come from? It must have had a
source of like character with its own. Ideas are not visible to the eye,
they are not heard by the ear, nor felt, nor tasted, yet we talk about
them as having existence. We recognize that they live, move, and have
being in the realm that we term mind.

This realm of mind is accepted by everybody as in some way connected
with the things that appear, but because it is not describable in terms
of length, breadth, and thickness, it is usually passed over as
something too vague for consideration.

But those who take up the study of this thing called mind find that it
can be analyzed and its laws and modes of operation understood.

To be ignorant of mind and its laws is to be a child playing with fire,
or a man manipulating powerful chemicals without knowing their relation
to one another. This is universally true; and all who are not learning
about mind are in like danger, because all are dealing with the great
cause from which spring forth all the conditions that appear in the
lives of all men and women. Mind is the one reservoir from which we draw
all that we make up into our world, and it is through the laws of mind
that we form our lives. Hence nothing is as important

<span id="page_88">p. 88</span>

as a knowledge of mind, its inherencies, and the mode of their
expression.

The belief that mind cannot be understood is fallacious. Man is the
expression of mind, dwells in mind, and can know more clearly and
definitely about mind than about the things that appear in the
phenomenal world.

It is only from the plane of mind that one can know Truth in an absolute
sense. That which we pronounce truth from the plane of appearances is
relative only. The relative truth is constantly changing, but the
absolute Truth endures; and what is true today always was and always
will be true.

It does not require scholastic culture to understand mind. Persons who
do not even know how to read or write may be very adept in the realm of
pure mind. It does not follow that he who talks most fluently about mind
knows the most. He may theoretically perceive the underlying principles
without realizing their working factors in his own being.

Mind is not language; mind is not formulation. These are outgrowths of
mind; they are man's way of communicating to his fellow man the concepts
of his mind. Thus very simple persons, from the world's standpoint,
frequently know a great deal about mind and its operation that they are
unable to express in language.

Women as a rule know more about pure mind on its own plane than men,
because they trust that inner

<span id="page_89">p. 89</span>

faculty of pure knowing called intuition more fully than men. The
medically wise of the world today cannot comprehend how a quiet little
person who knows nothing about physiology or medication can sit down
beside their dying patients and bring them back to health without
apparently doing anything. And they never will know until they delve
behind a knowledge of externality and learn mind to mind the workings of
Spirit.

Some persons confound the realm of knowledge about things formulated
through the intellect with pure knowledge. Intellect and its plane of
activity are not pure mind as the realm of matter is not Spirit.

The same essences of being enter into both, but wisdom is sadly lacking
in the intellectual realm. Intellect has formulated its conclusions from
the sense side of existence instead of from the spiritual side, and
these two sides are divergent.

No one can know about the potentialities of mind and how they are
manifested except through a study of mind itself without any reference
whatever to things or their relations.

One may logically deduce a system of being from abstract intellectual
reasoning, but it will lack the living fire that accompanies pure mind.

Those who study mind know the same things; and though they be dumb, they
enjoy the communion that ever goes on in thought. No one should for a

<span id="page_90">p. 90</span>

moment imagine that because he lacks the technical education of the
world that he is therefore not fitted to study the science of mind. No
matter how ignorant you may be of the world's ways or God's ways, if you
will give your mind to the attention of the one Mind, you will in due
season become wise. This great law of mind and Mind recognizing each
other and flowing together in unbroken wisdom has been known in all ages
and among all peoples. The scribes and Pharisees who knew the life and
lack of scholastic advantages of Jesus, the carpenter's son, exclaimed
in amazement, "How knoweth this man letters, having never learned?"

Mind is the great storehouse of good from which man draws all his
supplies. If you manifest life, you are confident that it had a source.
If you show forth intelligence you know that somewhere in the economy of
Being there is a fount of intelligence. So you may go over the elements
that go to make up your being and you will find that they draw their
sustenance from an invisible and, to your limited understanding,
incomprehensible source.

This source we term Mind, because it is as such that our comprehension
is best related to it. Names are arbitrary, and we should not stop to
note differences that are merely technical. We want to get at the
substance which they represent.

So if we call this invisible source Mind it is because it is of like
character with the thing within

<span id="page_91">p. 91</span>

our consciousness that we call our mind. Mind is manyfold in its
manifestations. It produces all that appears. Not that the character of
all that appears is to be laid to the volition of Mind; no, but some of
its factors enter into everything that appears. This is why it is so
important to know about Mind, and how its potentialities are made
manifest.

So we know that that which we term Mind is the reservoir of the universe
and man and that in it is stored up all that we may desire. So it
behooves us to study this great reservoir and learn its laws. We call it
Mind because through our study it has disclosed to us a quality that is
not apprehended by those who study it in its phenomenal aspect. The
physical scientist tells us that there is a universal energy in which
all motion, light, heat, color, and the like, have their origin.

We claim that what they have discovered is the power side of God and
that there is another factor that they have not discovered but that is
associated with the universal energy. That factor is divine wisdom. They
admit that there is evidence of design in the varied and beautiful
manifestation of this universal energy, but they are at a loss for a way
to make the acquaintance of the designer. To know this designer and
manipulator of the substance and energy of the universe is what our
system of mind development teaches. It instructs you how to acquaint
yourself with the qualities of Mind and

<span id="page_92">p. 92</span>

through them to seize upon the substance and life of the universe and
bring them into harmonious relations in your body and affairs. This is
something that few learned physical scientists have attempted, and here
is a field of discovery upon which few have yet launched forth. In fact
but few of the materialistic school have ever caught the first ray of
this light. They have, it is true, longed to know more about the wisdom
of the Creator, but it does not seem to have dawned upon them that the
wisdom of God is just as much present everywhere as energy and
substance. By all the methods known to their science they have tested
the many elements of the formed and formless earth and air and noted the
methodical and orderly workings of each under certain conditions. They
speak of molecular attraction, repulsion, polarity, and the like. Some
have said that every atom of matter is apparently intelligent; but as
these atoms do not speak their particular language, they have taken for
granted that they could not hold converse with them on the plane of
mind.

This is where we have set up a study that makes of every atom in the
universe a living center of wisdom as well as life and substance.

We claim that on its plane of comprehension man may ask the atom or the
mountain the secret that it holds and it will be revealed to him. This
is the communication of mind with Mind; hence we call Mind the universal
underlying cause of existence

<span id="page_93">p. 93</span>

and study it from that basis.

God is Mind, and man made in the image and likeness of God is Mind,
because there is but one Mind, and that the Mind of God. The person in
sense consciousness thinks he has a mind of his own and that he creates
thought from its own inherent substance. This is a suppositional mind
that passes away when the one and only real Mind is revealed. This one
and only Mind of God that we study is the only creator. It is that which
originates all that is permanent; hence it is the source of all reality.
Its creations are of a character hard for the sense man to comprehend,
because his consciousness is cast in a mold of space and time. These are
changeable and transient, while the creations of the one Mind are
substantial and lasting. But it is man's privilege to understand the
creations of the one Mind, for it is through them that he makes his
world. The creations of the one Mind are ideas. The ideas of God are
potential forces waiting to be set in motion through proper formative
vehicles. The thinking faculty in man is such a vehicle, and it is
through this that the visible universe has existence. Man does not
"create" anything if by this term is meant the producing of something
from nothing; but he does make the formless up into form; or rather it
is through his conscious co-operation that the one Mind forms its
universe. Hence the importance of man's willing co-operation with God in

<span id="page_94">p. 94</span>

every thought, because unless he is very wise in his thinking, he may be
sending forth malformations that will cause both himself and the
universe trouble.

Thinking is a process in mind by and through which the abstract is made
concrete. It is the process of working up into things those ideas in the
one Mind which are not things. God does not see things nor conditions as
man sees them, except through the thinking faculty in man (represented
by man in the Godhead).

The ideas of Divine Mind are whole and complete in their capacity to
unfold perpetually greater and more beautiful forms according to the
thinking capacity in man. Man catches mental sight of an idea in Divine
Mind and proceeds to put it in terms comprehensible to him on his plane
of consciousness. All ideas have their origin in Divine Mind, but their
character as unfolded by man depends entirely upon his acquaintance with
God. The idea of a house as formulated by man varies all the way from a
wigwam to the most magnificent castle. The original idea of a house, as
it exists in God's mind, cannot be anything less than the perfected
consciousness of man, of which his body is a symbol. This is the temple
"not made with hands," and it is the only temple acceptable to God.

No man can acceptably serve God or do His will until he understands the
fundamental principles of thinking and how thoughts are made manifest

<span id="page_95">p. 95</span>

as forms or states of consciousness. This is revealed by the Father to
everyone who seeks to know His law and to follow it. When man has thus
sought the Father with an eye single to His guidance, he begins to know
that certain relations exist between him and the Father and that only
through a maintenance of those relations can he come into harmony with
God and do His will.

The idea of the man separated in consciousness from Divine Mind is that
he was arbitrarily created by God, who could have chosen or not chosen
to create him, and that not being responsible for his existence, man has
a perfect right to be rebellious and petulant if hardships come into his
life. This is a childish view of the great plan of creation, in which
man is such an important factor. It is only when man becomes meek and
lowly, an obedient receptacle for the Spirit of God, that he sees the
divine plan of creation and his place in it. Then he becomes a willing
co-operator, because his understanding accepts the law as it is and
knows that it cannot be changed by either God or man. They are so
intimately linked together that the harmony of existence depends upon
their mutual understanding. When this is established by man's willing
obedience and acceptance of his part of the work, a new order of things
is set up and a new creation inaugurated. The first step in this new
order is the realization by man that he is in the world to do a specific
work. As

<span id="page_96">p. 96</span>

Jesus said at the age of twelve, "Knew ye not that I must be in my
Father's house?" and in His last prayer are these words, "I glorified
thee on the earth, having accomplished the work which thou hast given me
to do."

The Father has sent each one of us out to do a certain work. Are we
doing that work? Have we asked what it is? Or are we aimlessly wandering
about the earth trying to find satisfaction in the fleeting things of
sense?

"Ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free."

This truth is that of the relation of man to God and of how creation is
carried forward. The God-man relation is in one sense like that of
father and child; in another sense it is like that of creator-creative
instrument and creation manifest. Man constitutes the instrument of God
through which He brings his potentialities into visibility. As such an
instrument man is in a measure a dictator as to how it shall be done.
That is, man has discretionary power or free will. Freedom of will is
illusionary however because if man wills to carry on creation in
defiance of the divine plan and order, his creations in due time fall
into chaos through lack of coherency. God fixes the plan of the
structure and gives into the hands of man all the materials for
building. Man may also know the plan and build according to it, or he
may go ahead without consulting the plan.

<span id="page_97">p. 97</span>

Humanity has built age after age only to find that its structures do not
endure. They are faulty because the divine plan has not been consulted
by the builder.

Mind is the storehouse of ideas. Man draws all his ideas from this
omnipresent storehouse. The ideas of God, heaven, hell, devils, angels,
and all things have their clue in Mind. But their form in the
consciousness depends entirely upon the plane from which man draws his
mental images. If he gets a "clue" to the character of God and then
proceeds to clothe this clue idea with images from without, he makes God
a mortal. If he looks within for the clothing of his clue idea he knows
God to be the omnipresent Spirit of existence.

If man gets the clue idea from heaven and hell and devils and angels and
looks without for clothing for his idea, he makes a locality in the
skies and calls it heaven, and another under the earth and calls it
hell. But if he goes to the Father for information he finds both heaven
and hell within his own consciousness, both the result of his own
thought.

So it is of the utmost importance that we know how we have produced this
state of existence which we call life; and we should be swift to conform
to the only method calculated to bring harmony and success into our
life, namely to think in harmony with the understanding derived from
communion with the God-Mind.
