###  Demonstrating Christ Thought by Thought Chapter IX 

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Behold, what God hath wrought!  
An ideal man, a mighty man--  
A man supreme, who thought by thought  
Must demonstrate what God hath wrought.  
--CHARLES FILLMORE

</div>

MANIFEST MAN, personal man, began evolving the ideal man, that is,
"putting on Christ," ages and aeons ago. We are now nearly midway in
this evolution. The age of this evolution might be determined if we
could count the trillions of cells in our body where are inscribed the
experiences we had in the ages we have lived. However we know by
inspiration and analogy that our conscious creation began with this
earth. If science says the earth has been two billion years in evolving,
that is our age. When the morning stars were forming we were here.

He who reads the "signs of the times" discerns spiritually that we are
now in the midst of a race transition in which we are taking a very
pronounced upward swing in the development of the ideal man implanted in
us in the beginning. A new concept of God, man, and the universe is upon
us. We must realize all this and go upward with the mighty urge

<span id="page_71">p. 71</span>

for higher things. Will God take us up to an imaginary heaven in a
chariot of fire, or do we use our mind to lift ourselves heavenward?
"God helps those who help themselves" holds good in the heavens as in
the earth. We begin right where we are to bring forth the kingdom of God
within us. Every problem of life can be successfully solved if we begin
with the use of the I AM on the various planes of mind. It is not we
alone; it is when we realize that we can connect ourselves with the
Father-Mind and prove what Jesus said--"I speak not from myself: but the
Father abiding in me doeth his works"--that our potential almightiness
begins to appear.

If you are given to worry and anxiety, think about the fearless
confidence and trust of the Spirit. This will at once relieve your mind
of the thoughts that have stirred you, and the power of the Spirit will
begin its work of straightening out your affairs. If you are overwhelmed
with material work and the call of the outer world, stop and concentrate
in the I AM and say: "I am Spirit. I do not believe in matter or
material conditions. I have power, because I know that all power is in
Divine Mind. Divine Mind now sets my thoughts and all my affairs in
divine order, and I rest in the confidence and peace of the kingdom
within."

You can have a well body, but you must begin to build it with your word.
Instead of laying up weak and sick words in your body, begin now to

<span id="page_72">p. 72</span>

speak words of strength and health--and keep at it. Do not look at what
has been. Lot's wife tried that, and she never got beyond the past.
Clear out of your mind all rubbish about disease, and you will find that
none has any lodgment in your body. The thought makes the body and
determines the condition it lives in. Thoughts of health are living,
eternal things, and they work with the irresistible power of
almightiness to tone up the organism to their own high state of harmony
and capability.

There is but one way to establish harmony in the home, and that is to
establish it first in the individual. It is the law of Spirit that we
must be that which we would draw to us. If we would draw to us love, we
must be love, be loving and kind; if we would have peace and harmony in
our environment, we must establish it within ourselves. We must
faithfully and persistently deny the appearance of that which seems to
be inharmonious and silently and faithfully affirm the omnipresent
peace, love, and harmony that we want to see manifested. That which we
hold in consciousness will be made manifest for us, therefore we should
not hold the thought of anything that we do not want to see appear.

There is a relation between thinking and eating, and as you grow
spiritually the character of your food and all that pertains to eating
may have to be changed in conformity with the new order of things. If
you will leave meat and all animal products out of

<span id="page_73">p. 73</span>

your food you will see a change for the better. But above all, keep your
thought mastery and do not be controlled by appetite. Do not fear to
eat. Eat with thanksgiving and bless your food.

If you are looking to mental science alone for help you are certain to
be disappointed; "for neither is there any other name under heaven, that
is given among men, wherein we must be saved" than the name of Jesus
Christ. Jesus' teaching is something deeper and farther reaching than
mere mental science. It is not something that works things out for us in
the personal but is a power that transforms the whole man.

Here is what Judge Troward said on this subject:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">I have studied the subject (mental science) now for
several  
years, and have a general acquaintance with the leading  
features of most of the systems which unfortunately occupy  
attention in many circles at the present time, and I have  
no hesitation in saying that to the best of my judgment all  
sorts and descriptions of so-called occult study are in  
direct opposition to the real life-giving Truth.  
We hear a great deal in these days about "initiation," but  
believe me, the more you try to become a so-called  
"initiate," the further you will put yourself from living  
life. I speak after many years of careful study and  
consideration when I say that the Bible and its revelation  
of Christ is the one thing really worth studying, and it is  
a subject large enough in all conscience, embracing as it  
does our outward life of everyday concerns, and also the  
inner springs of our life and all that we can in general  
terms conceive of as life.  
</span>

</div>

Just in proportion as a person yields willingly and obediently to the
transforming process does he

<span id="page_74">p. 74</span>

demonstrate the Truth. All that pertains to self must be put away as
fast as it is revealed, and that which is of the universal, the Christ,
must take its place.

Be still and witness the salvation of the Lord. You doubtless fully know
that this stillness in the secret place of the Most High is not mental
torpor, but a quiet tranquillity that holds itself in an equipoise of
spiritual security. You have done your part when your true word has gone
forth. Now rest at the center and say: "It is well; Thy work is sure; I
am satisfied." Do not argue with anyone, nor discuss the matters that
you have submitted to Spirit; simply say, "All is well; it is finished."

Every man who accomplishes things sees first in his mind what he wishes
to do. He puts away all doubt. It makes no difference how small or how
large the thing you want to do may be; if you have an unlimited
confidence in your ability to do it, you will do it. Nothing can in any
way impede or defeat you. Faith is the highest expression of belief or
confidence. It is that something in man which says: "I believe in the
possibilities of things that I cannot see. I believe in the possibility
of Divine Mind doing in this age, right now, everything that was ever
done in any age." When we believe this and hold to it, putting aside all
doubt and whatever suggests failure, the thoughts of faith begin to
accumulate substance, and fulfillment follows.

In order to realize Truth and to demonstrate it

<span id="page_75">p. 75</span>

you must live it. If anyone appears careless, simply deny it and affirm
order and harmony. Allow nothing in the external to disturb your poise
and dominion. That is the way of love. When you refuse to see negative
things they will disappear, and you will be surprised to see how you
will change. Your mind, body, and affairs are the expression of your
thoughts, so if you are not happy, change your mental habits. This may
not seem practical to you at first, but if you will faithfully practice
the Golden Rule and send only thoughts of love to everyone, you will
witness practical results. You can cultivate the habit of seeing the
good, the true, the bright side of every subject, and then with your
friends you can bring this side out in conversation, thus keeping
yourself positive and poised, and at the same time sowing the seed of
Truth in the minds of others.

The "leading of the Spirit" is not something mysterious. When you open
your mind to the wisdom of God in the silence, you should claim in faith
that you have received, and trust that the Spirit does guide you.
"Christ Jesus . . . was made unto us wisdom"; and the more you affirm
that Christ is your wisdom the more you will realize the order and
harmony that result from the directing power of divine wisdom. But do
not be surprised and disappointed if everything does not work out
according to your old ideas. The all-seeing Mind should not be judged by
the dim and short vision of the mortal. What may

<span id="page_76">p. 76</span>

at first seem to you failure may prove to be a clearing away of rubbish
that will open the way in mind to a larger life.

Jesus showed by His life and teachings that it is the will of God for
men to be well. A clear understanding of this is necessary if one wants
to demonstrate health. Where there is a belief that God wills sickness
and suffering, His love and power are shut out of consciousness.
Spiritual healing depends on faith, and there cannot be faith while the
mind is holding thoughts directly opposed to the possibility of healing.
It is therefore very necessary to dwell much on the love and power of
God so that a steady, unwavering faith may be established.

The subconscious realm of mind is the realm that contains all past
thoughts. First, we think consciously and this thought becomes
subconscious, carrying on its work of building up or tearing down,
according to its character. The subconscious mind cannot take the
initiative, but depends on the conscious mind for direction. When one is
quickened of Spirit, one's true thoughts are set to work and the
subconscious states of error are broken up and dissolved. In one's daily
silence and communion with God, thoughts from the subconsciousness come
into the conscious realm of mind to be forgiven and redeemed. Flesh
heredity is denied and inheritance from God affirmed, which enables man
consciously to draw divine ideas from the one Mind. These ideas are
established

<span id="page_77">p. 77</span>

in consciousness and the whole mentality is at one with Christ, the
divine-man idea.

All wisdom is implanted in us by divine intelligence, which is another
name for God. In the degree that we awaken to the consciousness of our
inherent wisdom, in that degree we are responsible to the Father and are
required to render unto Him the fruitage of our wisdom. All of us unfold
according to our understanding and realization. Whether our
understanding is small or large, we must measure up to or demonstrate
that which has been given us. "To whomsoever much is given, of him shall
much be required."

The phrase "body of Christ" has a threefold significance. First, as
regards its application to the body of Jesus, in Matthew 26:26, 27 Jesus
called the bread He had blessed His body and the wine His blood. Out of
this came the symbolic rite of the Lord's Supper. All symbols are useful
to the extent that they point man to the realities for which they stand.
When this reality is discerned the symbols are understood. Jesus dwelt
continually in the consciousness of being the very substance and life of
God. "He that hath seen me hath seen the Father." Through the conscious
realization of His oneness with God His body became a "body of life,"
spiritual substance, His blood the life of God. This is the body and
blood He gave as a "ransom for many"; the understanding that the Christ
body comes not by the

<span id="page_78">p. 78</span>

grave but through our daily realization of the omnipresence of substance
and life and our union with it.

Secondly, the words "body of Christ" refer to man's spiritual body.
"Until Christ be formed in you." When we appropriate words of Truth,
"eat them," so to speak, we partake of the substance and life of Spirit
and build the Christ body. This is partaking of the body and blood of
Jesus Christ, the true sacrament that vitalizes the body by renewing the
mind. Every student of Truth builds the Christ body as he constantly
abides in the Christ Mind through daily meditation upon words of Truth.

Thirdly, the phrase "body of Christ" applies to the group of people who
find perfect unity in Spirit, free from all the limitations and
authority of creed. Such a group is free from bondage to the letter and
subject only to the Spirit of truth. Jesus Christ is the head of this
body, and its members are joined through a recognition of universal
Spirit. This "body of Christ" is sometimes referred to as the "church of
Christ." This latter term is commonly misunderstood in that many sects
call themselves the "church of Christ," each believing they are the
chosen of God. God is not partial and does not choose. Man exercises
that privilege, and if he chooses to conform to the "law of the Spirit
of life in Christ Jesus" he becomes a member of the church of Christ and
is recognized by the Father. There is unity only in Spirit, and "God is
Spirit." All personal opinions upon which

<span id="page_79">p. 79</span>

creeds are based disappear before the spiritual understanding that the
only real unity is the body of Christ, His church. All who measure up to
the Christ standard, forsaking everything pertaining to the personal,
limited self, bringing forth the unlimited fruits of the Spirit, are
members of this body, the "body of Christ." Through this body is to come
the "restoration of all things, whereof God spake by the mouth of his
holy prophets that have been from of old."
