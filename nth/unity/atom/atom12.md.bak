###  Truth Radiates Light Chapter X 

ALTHOUGH Paul did not demonstrate complete overcoming, as Jesus did, he
saw in man as a mystery the truth that had been lost sight of for "ages
and generations . . . which is Christ in you, the hope of glory." We are
urged by both Jesus and Paul to glorify God in our bodies. The body is
the fruit of the mind, therefore we must become better acquainted with
the mind and with the supermind in order to glorify the body.

The fact is that the entire theme of the Bible is man and his various
states of mind, represented as persons, tents, tabernacles, temples. In
Exodus we read, "Let them make me a sanctuary, that I may dwell among
them." It is explained that this sanctuary was to be the meeting place
of the people and their God and eventually the dwelling place of
Jehovah. Jehovah means the I AM, which is also the meaning of the Christ
or the supermind. Where in all the universe can man meet the supermind
save in his own mind and body?

We are then compelled to conclude that the Tabernacle of the Israelites
and the Temple of Solomon are symbols of man's body, the real meeting
place of Jehovah.

Paul says, "We are a temple of the living God; even as God said, I will
dwell in them, and walk in

<span id="page_81">p. 81</span>

them."

When Solomon was preparing to build the Temple he soliloquized: "But who
is able to build him a house, seeing heaven and the heaven of heavens
cannot contain him? who am I then, that I should build him a house, save
only to burn incense before him?" The burning of incense in the house of
Jehovah represents the spiritualization of the fine essences of the body
through adoration and exalted thoughts. When the mind is lifted up in
meditation and prayer the whole body glows with spiritual light.

This spiritual light transcends in glory all the laws of matter and
intellect. Even Moses could not enter the Tabernacle when it was aglow
with this transcendent light.

It is written that the Israelites did not go forward on days when the
cloud remained over the Tabernacle, but when the cloud was taken up they
went forward. This means that there is no soul progress for man when his
body is under the shadow of a "clouded" mind, but when the cloud is
removed there is an upward and forward movement of the whole
consciousness (all the people).

We are warned of the effect of thoughts that are against or opposed to
the commandments of Jehovah. When we murmur and complain we cloud our
minds, and Divine Mind cannot reach us or help us. Then we usually loaf
until something turns up that

<span id="page_82">p. 82</span>

causes us to think on happier things, when we go forward again.

Instead of giving up to circumstances and outer events we should
remember that we are all very close to a kingdom of mind that would make
us always happy and successful if we would cultivate it and make it and
its laws a vital part of our life. "The joy of Jehovah is your
strength."

You ask, "How can I feel the joy of Jehovah when I am poor, or sick, or
unhappy?"

Jesus said, "Come unto me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I
will give you rest."

Here is the first step in getting out of the mental cloud that obscures
the light of Spirit. Take the promises of Jesus as literally and
spiritually true. Right in the midst of the most desperate situation one
can proclaim the presence and power of Christ, and that is the first
mental move in dissolving the darkness. You cannot think of Jesus
without a feeling of freedom and light. Jesus taught freedom from
mortality and proclaimed His glory so persistently that He energized our
thought atmosphere into light. This light is Spirit power, and it can be
seen and felt by anyone who will call on the name Christ and expect it
to raise him quickly out of depression and negative states of mind into
the power and zeal of an overcomer through Christ.

The Scriptures state that when Moses came down from Mount Sinai with the
Ten Commandments his

<span id="page_83">p. 83</span>

face shone so brilliantly that the Children of Israel and even Aaron,
his own brother, were afraid to come near him until he put a veil over
his face. The original Hebrew says his face sent forth beams or horns of
light.

The Vulgate says that Moses had "a horned face"; which Michelangelo took
literally, in his statue of Moses representing him with a pair of horns
projecting from the head. Thus we see the ludicrous effect of reading
the Bible according to the letter.

Our men of science have experimented with the brain in action, and they
tell us that it is true that we radiate beams when we think. The force
of these beams has been measured.

Here we have further confirmation of the many statements in the Bible
that have been taken as ridiculous and unbelievable or as miracles.

Persons who spend much time in prayer and meditate a great deal on
spiritual things develop the same type of face that Moses is said to
have had. We say of them that their faces fairly shine when they talk
about God and His love. John saw Jesus on the island of Patmos, and he
says, "His countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength."

I have witnessed this radiance in the faces of Truth teachers hundreds
of times. I well remember one class lesson during which the teacher
became so eloquent that beams of light shot forth from her

<span id="page_84">p. 84</span>

head and tongues of fire flashed through the room, very like those which
were witnessed when the followers of Jesus were gathered in Jerusalem.

We now know that fervent words expressed in prayer and song and eloquent
proclamations of spiritual Truth release the millions of electrons in
our brain cells and through them blend like chords of mental music with
the Mind universal.

This tendency on our part to analyze and scientifically dissect the many
supposed miracles recorded in the Bible is often regarded as
sacrilegious, or at least as making commonplaces of some of the very
spectacular incidents recorded in Scripture.

In every age preceding this the priesthood has labored under the
delusion that the common people could not understand the real meaning of
life and that they should therefore be kept in ignorance of its inner
sources; also that the masses could not be trusted with sacred truths,
that imparting such truths to them was like casting pearls before swine.

But now science is delving into hidden things, and it is found that they
all arise in and are sustained by universal principles that are open to
all men who seek to know and apply them.

So the time has arrived when all shall know the Truth, "from the least
to the greatest of them." Of course there are many sides to Truth. What
we mean by Truth is concerned with the great fundamental questions that
have always perplexed and at the same

<span id="page_85">p. 85</span>

time engaged the profoundest attention of men: What is the character of
God? How does God create? What is the real character of man, and what
relation does he bear to his source? What is the ultimate destiny of man
and the universe?

These are some of the fundamental questions that meet us at every turn.
They have been answered by both philosophers and priests in every age,
yet they still remain largely unanswered in the popular estimation. Of
course the priests think they have the answer, but they offer no proof
save that of inspiration.

The philosophers and scientists are not satisfied with the answers of
the spiritually inspired. They want facts, and they are testing the seen
and the unseen for forces that respond to certain laws without variation
or deviation. They claim that the theological explanation of creation by
Moses and the location and description of the kingdom of heaven by Jesus
are not specific enough and cannot be definitely and scientifically
proved; all of which is approximately true. Popular religion does not
attempt to harmonize its fundamental facts with the findings of science,
and in its ignorance it fights science and thinks that science is
destroying the faith of the people in things spiritual.

Anyone who will search for the science in religion and the religion in
science will find that they harmonize and prove each other. The point of
unity

<span id="page_86">p. 86</span>

is the Spirit-mind common to both. So long as religion assumes that the
Spirit that creates and sustains man and the universe can be cajoled and
by prayer or some other appeal can be induced to change its laws, it
cannot hope to be recognized by those who know that unchangeable law
rules everywhere and in everything.

Again, so long as science ignores the principle of intelligence in the
evolutionary and directive forces of man and the universe, just so long
will it fail to understand religion and the power of thought in the
changes that are constantly taking place in the world, visible and
invisible.
