###  Contact with the Christ Mind Chapter XII 

WE MAY TAKE it for granted on the basis of many Scripture passages that
all of us who accept God as an associate in life are consciously in
intimate contact with the Holy Spirit. However it will strengthen our
faith and greatly add to the effectiveness of the Holy Spirit in its
work with us if we understand its character and the law under which it
co-operates with us in the development of mind, body, and affairs.

Theologians differ in their conceptions of the Holy Spirit. Some define
it as a principle, but the majority refer to it as "He"; that is, as the
third person of the Trinity. In the Scriptures it is named variously. In
Genesis 1:2 it is spoken of as "the Spirit of God" moving upon the face
of the waters. We read in Job 33:4:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"The Spirit of God hath made me,  
And the breath of the Almighty giveth me life."  
</span>

</div>

Bible authorities (Scofield, for example) say that wherever the name El
Shaddai occurs in the Hebrew Scriptures it should have been translated
"Nourisher" or "Strength-giver," which in Hebrew is the feminine name
for God. This verse may be read:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"The Spirit of God hath made me,  
And the breath of the mother giveth me life."  
</span>

</div>

<span id="page_99">p. 99</span>

In Psalms 104:30 it is written, "Thou sendest forth thy Spirit." The
Spirit is omnipresent, as revealed in the 139th Psalm:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Whither shall I go from thy Spirit?  
Or whither shall I flee from thy presence?"  
</span>

</div>

Read all this psalm for a comprehension of the universality of the Holy
Spirit's work in the creation of man and his evolution.

The Holy Spirit in Divine Mind corresponds to our thought in our minds.
God is Mind; God's idea of His creation is His Son, and this Son (idea),
executing the plans of God (the original Mind) corresponds to our
thinking in its work of devising plans. We may ideate without
restriction, but when we come to the execution of our ideas we have to
respect certain laws, which we sometimes consider restrictions. So we
can ideate the unlimited Divine Mind, but when this Mind is brought into
our world or consciousness it is limited to our conception of it.

With a clear understanding of the relation that ideas bear to their
manifestation, we can approach God with confidence; then we have access
to the real, unlimited creative ideas, and we co-operate with the Holy
Spirit and get greater results. We can thus lay hold of a healing or a
prosperity thought and confidently affirm that in mind we are quickened
and made whole; that we are prospered, and that we are successful in all
our ways, because we are working with and through the whole Spirit of
God,

<span id="page_100">p. 100</span>

the Holy Spirit of wisdom and love.

In Matthew Jesus asked the Pharisees, "What think ye of the Christ?
whose son is he? They say unto him, The son of David. He saith unto
them, How then doth David in the Spirit call him Lord, saying,

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"The Lord said unto my Lord,  
Sit thou on my right hand,  
Till I put thine enemies underneath thy feet?  
</span>

</div>

"If David then calleth him Lord, how is he his son?"

This lesson, which Jesus gave to His disciples, brings out clearly the
relation that the universal or Jehovah-Mind bears to the personal or
Christ Mind. This also suggests that David was not the forebear of
Christ, but that the Lord or Christ of David existed before the human
person was born. It follows that the Christ in Jesus existed before the
personality. This is true of all of us. Christ is the spiritual mind in
every individual, and the spiritual mind is the offspring of the
universal or Jehovah-Mind.

When Paul said, "Until Christ be formed in you," he referred to the
development in man of the super-mind.

All the divine perfection that exists in the universal Jehovah-Mind can
be brought into direct contact with its image and likeness, the Christ,
imprinted in the beginning in each individual. As he develops
spiritually man releases, rounds out,

<span id="page_101">p. 101</span>

and fully expresses that divine perfection which is potentially in his
soul.

The affirmation of any good statement of health puts us in conscious
contact with the Christ Mind universal and quickens and releases the
energy stored up in the subconscious mind, and the process of
rejuvenation begins its work. This renewal of man's youth through the
recognition of Jehovah confirms Psalm 103:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Bless Jehovah, O my soul;  
And all that is within me, bless his holy name.  
Bless Jehovah, O my soul,  
And forget not all his benefits:  
Who forgiveth all thine iniquities;  
Who healeth all thy diseases;  
Who redeemeth thy life from destruction;  
Who crowneth thee with lovingkindness and tender mercies;  
Who satisfieth thy desire with good things,  
So that thy youth is renewed like the eagle.  
</span>

</div>

All those who in faith have persistently applied this law of spiritual
acknowledgment of the Christ have received benefits that bear witness to
the fact that man can overcome sin, sickness, and old age and rise out
of the race belief in human limitation, and finally attain eternal life
as Jesus attained it.

Jesus warned us not to lay up treasure in a material way but to be "rich
toward God," as taught in the 12th chapter of Luke. Jesus was rich
toward God in that He knew how to release the creative substance
implanted in Him from the beginning.

<span id="page_102">p. 102</span>

This same substance is within every one of us; when released, it makes
contact with the universal substance, and invisible currents of supply
begin to carry their riches to us. It is not necessary that we
understand scientifically all the activities of the pent-up substance in
our minds, although we shall eventually understand every step of the
way.

A simple word of blessing poured out upon that which we have or that
which we can conceive as possible for us as sons of the all-providing
God will at least begin to release the superabundance of Spirit
substance, and we shall have an inner confidence and faith in the
providence of our Father.

Jesus warned us not to be anxious about temporal needs but to pray,
believing, and to bless and give thanks; then right in the face of
seeming insufficiency we should be enabled to demonstrate plenty. Jesus
illustrated this when He showed how giving thanks in a devout
consciousness for this inner substance would multiply the apparently
insignificant resources (the five loaves and two fishes) until they
became sufficient to meet the hunger of more than five thousand persons.

A textbook on the redemption or reconstruction of man should cover every
phase of human character. Human egotism should be repressed; man's
spiritual identity exalted. Remedies for the greatest evils of humanity
should be given plentifully, and the lesser

<span id="page_103">p. 103</span>

evils minimized.

Our Scriptures, plus the guidance of "the Spirit of truth" recommended
by Jesus, form such a textbook for Christians. In this combination is
found instruction fitted to the needs of the multitude. The timid and
fearful read, "Have not I commanded thee? Be strong and of good courage;
be not affrighted, neither be thou dismayed: for Jehovah thy God is with
thee whithersoever thou goest."

How an inflated personal ego usurps and finally destroys the
spirituality of one who once was anointed king of Israel is illustrated
in the life of Saul. The stimulation of the spiritual ego is forcefully
taught and demonstrated by prophets and great religious leaders. It is
written in the Psalms:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"I said, Ye are gods,  
And all of you are sons of the Most High."  
</span>

</div>

Jesus reiterated this and was denounced by the Pharisees because He
declared, "I and the Father are one."

Christian metaphysicians have discovered that man can greatly accelerate
the growth in himself of the Christ Mind by using affirmations that
identify him with the Christ. These affirmations often are so far beyond
the present attainment of the novice as to seem ridiculous, but when it
is understood that the statements are grouped about an ideal to be
attained, they seem fair and reasonable.

The spiritual man is clothed by the aspirations,

<span id="page_104">p. 104</span>

the thoughts, and the acts of the natural or physical man. It is here,
in this realm of so-called matter, that character is formed. By faith,
prayer, meditation, and inward resolutions man identifies himself with
the spiritual man and forms in both mind and body the things affirmed.
There was no visible evidence of Jesus' unity with the Father when He
affirmed, "I and the Father are one." His disciples said, "Lord, show us
the Father, and it sufficeth us." So we find that we must be true to our
ideas, and clothe them with an assumption of their tangibility even
before they have appeared. We must pray, believing that we have received
and we shall receive.

States of mind established in the consciousness gather to themselves
vitamins, cells, nerves, muscles, the flesh itself. To see oneself in
mind spiritually courageous, strong, and healthy will instill health in
the primal elements of the organism, which in due season will work to
the surface in a perfect body.

We must all learn to look to the mental man for causes. For example, no
one but a metaphysician knows the origin of disease germs. The physician
takes it for granted that disease germs exist as an integral part of the
natural world; the metaphysician sees disease germs as the manifested
results of anger, revenge, jealousy, fear, impurity, and many other mind
activities. A change of mind will change the character of a germ. Love,
courage, peace, strength, and good will form good character and build
bodily

<span id="page_105">p. 105</span>

structures of a nature like these qualities of mind.

The same general law is carried out in everything with which man has to
do. Financial success or failure depends on the attitude of mind active
in both those who achieve success and those who fall under the negations
of failure. To attain prosperity, think about prosperity, industry, and
efficiency. Fill your mind to overflowing with thoughts of success;
realize that the fullness of all good belongs to you by divine right. To
this add a feeling of happiness and joy and you have the recipe for
abundant and lasting prosperity.
