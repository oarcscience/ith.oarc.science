###  

understanding--God is supreme knowing. That in man which comprehends is
understanding; it knows and comprehends in wisdom. Its comparisons are
not made in the realm of form, but in the realm of ideas. It knows how
to accomplish things. Spiritual discernment reveals that knowledge and
intelligence are auxiliary to understanding.

There are two ways of getting understanding. One is by following the
guidance of Spirit that dwells within, and the other is to go blindly
ahead and learn by hard experience.

Intellectual understanding of Truth is a tremendous step in advance of
sense consciousness, and its possession brings a temptation to use for
selfish ends the wisdom and power thereby revealed.

Spiritual understanding is the quickening of the Spirit within.
Spiritual understanding is the ability of the mind to apprehend and
realize the laws of thought and the relation of ideas one to another.

unfoldment--Bringing out by successive development; growth. As we unfold
spiritually day by day, Spirit reveals more and more good to us. (see I
Cor. 2:9)

union with God--Unification of our consciousness with that of God-Mind.
This is the Christ consciousness. "I and the Father are one" (John
10:30).

unity--Universal oneness of God, man, and all creation. The only real
unity is in Spirit. It is found nowhere else because personality always
strives for its own success and aims for the good of the personal man,
instead of the good of all men.

Man makes conscious unity with God first at the center of spirituality,
this center having its basis of action in the top of the head. The only
way to establish unity with the Father-Mind is by prayer. God's name is
I AM. Our name is I AM. Speaking this name in the silence, recognizing
that it is God's name and ours, we establish conscious unity with Him.

universal--All-encompassing. There is one life force: the creative
universal life, even God. This life is eternal and infinite, from
everlasting to everlasting.

universal resource--Omnipresent cosmic substance and reality from which
all supply flows to man by means of his spoken word.

universal Spirit--Omnipresent, omnipotent, and omniscient God.

universal substance--The omnipresent mind stuff that can be molded to
man's use through his thinking; mind substance.

universal urge--The urge toward perfection. In man this urge is the
spiritual seed of the Christ, which ever seeks to unfold its divine
nature.

universe--The total of all that is. It was first expressed as an idea in
Divine Mind and later made manifest; that is, it became visible to the
five senses by means of the creative power, the Word.

unreal--That which is temporal or transient; not based on Truth. Evil is
the perfect example of the unreal. As soon as divine law is applied, the
unreal, evil, has no existence. In Truth, it is nothing.

upper chamber--A higher state of consciousness attained through prayer
or by going into the silence. "And when they were come in, they went up
into the upper chamber, where they were abiding" (Acts 1:13).

The "upper chamber" to which the apostles went for the baptism of the
Holy Spirit is the high state of mind that we assume in thinking about
spiritual things. It may be attained through prayer, going into the
silence with true words, or in meditation.
