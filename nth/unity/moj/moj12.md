###  John: Chapter 10 

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that entereth not
by the  
door into the fold of the sheep, but climbeth up some other  
way, the same is a thief and a robber. 2 But he that  
entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep. 3 To  
him the porter openeth; and the sheep hear his voice: and  
he calleth his own sheep by name, and leadeth them out. 4  
When he hath put forth all his own, he goeth before them,  
and the sheep follow him: for they know his voice. 5 And a  
stranger will they not follow, but will flee from him: for  
they know not the voice of strangers. 6 This parable spake  
Jesus unto them: but they understood not what things they  
were which he spake unto them.  
</span>

</div>

THE DOOR OF YOUR mind is your open-mindedness. "I am the door of the
sheep." "Sheep" are your thoughts. "A thief and a robber" is mortal
thought. The "porter" is the will. The "good shepherd" is the spiritual
I AM.

All forces that come into your consciousness in any other way than
through your own I AM are thieves and robbers. No man can be saved from
the limitations and mistakes of ignorance except through his own
volition.

There is a widespread belief that we can turn over to those who have
better understanding the straightening out of our tangled thoughts. Such
help may be extended temporarily, but it always proves "a thief and a
robber" in the end. The true healer is always the teacher and instructs
his patients how to open the door to the "good shepherd," the divine I
AM.

<span id="page_101">p. 101</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">7 Jesus therefore said unto them again, Verily,
verily, I  
say unto you, I am the door of the sheep. 8 All that came  
before me are thieves and robbers: but the sheep did not  
hear them. 9 I am the door; by me if any man enter in, he  
shall be saved, and shall go in and go out, and shall find  
pasture. 10 The thief cometh not, but that he may steal,  
and kill, and destroy: I came that they may have life, and  
may have it abundantly. 11 I am the good shepherd: the good  
shepherd layeth down his life for the sheep. 12 He that is  
a hireling, and not a shepherd, whose own the sheep are  
not, beholdeth the wolf coming, and leaveth the sheep, and  
fleeth, and the wolf snatcheth them, and scattereth them:  
13 he fleeth because he is a hireling; and careth not for  
the sheep. 14 I am the good shepherd; and I know mine own,  
and mine own know me, 15 even as the Father knoweth me, and  
I know the Father; and I lay down my life for the sheep. 16  
And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them  
also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and they  
shall become one flock, one shepherd. 17 Therefore doth the  
Father love me, because I lay down my life, that I may take  
it again. 18 No one taketh it away from me, but I lay it  
down of myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have  
power to take it again. This commandment received I from my  
Father.  
</span>

</div>

"The good shepherd layeth down his life for the sheep." This means that
the high spiritual I AM lets itself become identified with the
limitations of self-consciousness that it may lift all up to the
spiritual plane. "I lay down my life, that I may take it again."

When we open the door of the mind by consciously affirming the presence
and power of the divine I AM in our midst, there is a marriage or union

<span id="page_102">p. 102</span>

of the higher forces in being with the lower, and we find that we are
quickened in every part; the life of the I AM has been poured out for
us. Thus Christ becomes the Saviour of the whole world, by pouring this
higher spiritual energy (His blood) into human consciousness, which each
must take for himself and identify himself with. The individual I AM is
the only door through which it can get into our thoughts in a legitimate
way. If it comes through mediumship or hypnotism or mental suggestion,
without our willing co-operation, it is "a thief and a robber."

There is but one life-giver, one Saviour, the Christ; and the only door
through which the divine essence can come to us is through our own I AM.
Jesus of Nazareth points the way, but everyone must take up his cross
and follow Him, must "overcome" as He overcame.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">19 There arose a division again among the Jews
because of  
these words. 20 And many of them said, He hath a demon, and  
is mad; why hear ye him? 21 Others said, These are not the  
sayings of one possessed with a demon. Can a demon open the  
eyes of the blind?  
</span>

</div>

The word Jews in this instance refers to the Pharisaical Jews who are
following the letter of the law. There is always a division among the
intellectually wise and an arguing back and forth. It is the Christ
consciousness alone that seeks the unity of all things.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">22 And it was the feast of the dedication at
Jerusalem:  
</span>

<span id="page_103">p. 103</span>

23 it was winter; and Jesus was walking in the temple in  
Solomon's porch.  

</div>

Partaking of a feast in Solomon's Porch in the Temple symbolizes our
peaceful thought people appropriating spiritual substance in an outer
state of consciousness (porch).

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">24 The Jews therefore came round about him, and said
unto  
him, How long dost thou hold us in suspense? If thou art  
the Christ, tell us plainly. 25 Jesus answered them, I told  
you, and ye believe not: the works that I do in my Father's  
name, these bear witness of me. 26 But ye believe not,  
because ye are not of my sheep.  
</span>

</div>

In this Scripture Jesus symbolizes the I AM or Christ, and the Jews
symbolize our high-brow intellectual thoughts, which hold to the letter
of the law to such an extent that they cannot let the spiritual word
expand in and through the consciousness.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">27 My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they
follow  
me: 28 and I give unto them eternal life; and they shall  
never perish, and no one shall snatch them out of my hand.  
29 My Father, who hath given them unto me, is greater than  
all; and no one is able to snatch them out of the Father's  
hand. 30 I and the Father are one.  
</span>

</div>

"My sheep hear my voice." The sheep are our gentle, obedient thoughts
that are always open to the inspiration of the Christ. Man's soul is
encased in the body, with its great organ or instrument from which
issues forth the human voice. When man is

<span id="page_104">p. 104</span>

established in his I AM power and dominion, His voice is strong and
vibrant and commanding. God revealed Himself to the prophets of old
through the "still small voice." While it is not audible it is distinct
and clear. Many ask how to distinguish the real voice. They hear voices
and voices but do not understand how to distinguish the real one. If man
follows the Holy Spirit, the one teacher, if he concentrates on the
power of the word and holds continuously for the leading of the Spirit
of truth, he will enter into a state of spiritual discernment in which
he can readily distinguish the still small voice.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">31 The Jews took up stones again to stone him. 32
Jesus  
answered them, Many good works have I showed you from the  
Father; for which of those works do ye stone me? 33 The  
Jews answered him, For a good work we stone thee not, but  
for blasphemy; and because that thou, being a man, makest  
thyself God. 34 Jesus answered them, Is it not written in  
your law, I said, Ye are gods? 35 If he called them gods,  
unto whom the word of God came (and the scripture cannot be  
broken), 36 say ye of him, whom the Father sanctified and  
sent into the world, Thou blasphemest; because I said, I am  
the Son of God? If I do not the works of my Father, believe  
me not. 38 But if I do them, though ye believe not me,  
believe the works: that ye may know and understand that the  
Father is in me, and I in the Father. 39 They sought again  
to take him: and he went forth out of their hand.  
40 And he went away again beyond the Jordan into the place  
where John was at the first baptizing; and there he abode.  
41 And many came unto him; and they said, John indeed did  
no sign: but all things whatsoever John spake of this man  
were  
</span>

<span id="page_105">p. 105</span>

true. 42 And many believed on him there.  

</div>

After the Christ has done a positive work it always withdraws to an
inner state of consciousness in order to replenish its power before it
goes forth to achieve again. Into this state of consciousness opposing
intellect cannot find entrance. But after a season the Christ again
penetrates into the Jordan or subconsciousness made up of thoughts good,
bad, and indifferent. Here man is in an ignorant and unredeemed state.
His concepts are turbulent with materiality. However here again the
light of the Christ penetrates, and many believe and receive the Truth.
Jesus has made conscious unity with His supermind or I AM mind and
through it with the Father. This is the only way in which any man can
attain perfection.

Here again Jesus emphasizes the importance of works to prove one's
claims of spiritual authority and power. "If I do not the works of my
Father, believe me not." The world is full of religious leaders who
cannot do the works promised by Jesus, and yet they are accepted as His
representative. He said, "These signs shall accompany them that
believe."
