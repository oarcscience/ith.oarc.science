###  John: Chapter 7 

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">And after these things Jesus walked in Galilee: for
he  
would not walk in Judaea, because the Jews sought to kill  
him. 2 Now the feast of the Jews, the feast of tabernacles,  
was at hand. His brethren therefore said unto him, Depart  
hence, and go into Judaea, that thy disciples also may  
behold thy works which thou doest. 4 For no man doeth  
anything in secret, and himself seeketh to be known openly.  
If thou doest these things, manifest thyself to the world.  
5 For even his brethren did not believe on him. 6 Jesus  
therefore saith unto them, My time is not yet come; but  
your time is always ready. 7 The world cannot hate you; but  
me it hateth, because I testify of it, that its works are  
evil. 8 Go ye up unto the feast: I go not up unto this  
feast; because my time is not yet fulfilled. 9 And having  
said these things unto them, he abode still in Galilee.  
10 But when his brethren were gone up unto the feast, then  
went he also up, not publicly, but as it were in secret. 11  
The Jews therefore sought him at the feast, and said, Where  
is he? 12 And there was much murmuring among the multitudes  
concerning him: some said, He is a good man; others said,  
Not so, but he leadeth the multitude astray. 13 Yet no man  
spake openly of him for fear of the Jews.

JESUS WAS DEVELOPING His spiritual nature, which is under spiritual law.
The Pharisaical Jews followed the letter of the law, which resists and
seeks the destruction of the Christ. The Christ usually moves in secret.
It does its spiritual work quietly instead of showing off. Some of the
multitude thought Jesus was a good man; others thought He had led the
people astray. This represents the quibbling of the lesser mind.

<span class="small">14 But when it was now the midst of the feast Jesus
went up  
into the temple, and taught. 15 The Jews therefore  
marvelled, saying, How knowest this man letters, having  
never learned? 16 Jesus therefore answered them, and said,  
My teaching is not mine, but his that sent me. 17 If any  
man willeth to do his will, he shall know of the teaching,  
whether it is of God, or whether I speak from myself. 18 He  
that speaketh from himself seeketh his own glory: but he  
that seeketh the glory of him that sent him, the same is  
true, and no unrighteousness is in him. 19 Did not Moses  
give you the law, and yet none of you doeth the law? Why  
seek ye to kill me? 20 The multitude answered, Thou hast a  
demon: who seeketh to kill thee? 21 Jesus answered and said  
unto them, I did one work, and ye all marvel because  
thereof. 22 Moses hath given you circumcision (not that it  
is of Moses, but of the fathers); and on the sabbath ye  
circumcise a man. 23 If a man receiveth circumcision on the  
sabbath, that the law of Moses may not be broken; are ye  
wroth with me, because I made a man every whit whole on the  
sabbath? 24 Judge not according to appearance, but judge  
righteous judgment.  
25 Some therefore of them of Jerusalem said, Is not this he  
whom they seek to kill? 26 And lo, he speaketh openly, and  
they say nothing unto him. Can it be that the rulers indeed  
know that this is the Christ? 27 Howbeit we know this man  
whence he is: but when the Christ cometh, no one knoweth  
whence he is. 28 Jesus therefore cried in the temple,  
teaching and saying, Ye both know me, and know whence I am;  
and I am not come to myself, but he that sent me is true,  
whom ye know not. 29 I know him; because I am from him, and  
he sent me. 30 They sought therefore to take him: and no  
man laid his hand on him, because his hour was not yet  
come. 31 But of the multitude many believed  
</span>

<span id="page_80">p. 80</span>

on him; and they said, When the Christ shall come, will he  
do more signs than those which this man hath done? 32 The  
Pharisees heard the multitude murmuring these things  
concerning him; and the chief priests and the Pharisees  
sent officers to take him. 33 Jesus therefore said, Yet a  
little while am I with you, and I go unto him that sent me.  
34 Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am,  
ye cannot come. 35 The Jews therefore said among  
themselves, Whither will this man go that we shall not find  
him? will he go unto the Dispersion among the Greeks, and  
teach the Greeks? 36 What is this word that he said, Ye  
shall seek me, and shall not find me; and where I am, ye  
cannot come?  

</div>

Jesus' disciples wanted Him to go up to Jerusalem for one reason: to
prove that He was the Christ, but He realized that He had not yet
attained the necessary power. After they had departed He got more
spiritual consciousness and was moved to go under the protection of
Spirit, and in this state of mind the Jews could not lay their hands on
Him or injure Him in any way. Jesus, like all persons who are growing
spiritually, felt the power within Him to be much stronger than He could
manifest without. He wanted to prove to His friends that He was the
Christ but doubted His ability.

He was not speaking from Himself for His own glory, but He was seeking
the glory of Him that sent Him.

The all-knowing Christ Mind can easily handle the Pharisaical mind that
is following the letter of the law. The intellectual mind cannot
understand the claim of the spiritual that it can go where it

<span id="page_81">p. 81</span>

cannot be found by those present. The mind that functions in matter
cannot comprehend a state in which matter can pass through matter.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">37 Now on the last day, the great day of the feast,
Jesus  
stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come  
unto me and drink. 38 He that believeth on me, as the  
scripture hath said, from within him shall flow rivers of  
living water. 39 But this spake he of the Spirit, which  
they that believed on him were to receive: for the Spirit  
was not yet given; because Jesus was not yet glorified.  
</span>

</div>

Jesus realized that man's real thirst is for Spirit and that this thirst
can only be quenched through an outpouring of the Holy Spirit within the
soul, which thrills one with new life and energy and vitality.

If we have understanding faith we know that there is no cessation of
life and that we have only to open our consciousness more and more to
the Spirit of life in order to realize that from within flow rivers of
living water.

The Holy Spirit was in evidence before the time of Jesus, but He gave a
new impetus to this indwelling helper and promised that the holy
Comforter would be with us throughout all time.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">40 Some of the multitude therefore, when they heard
these  
words, said, This is of a truth the prophet. 41 Others  
said, This is the Christ. But some said, What, doth the  
Christ come out of Galilee? 42 Hath not the scripture said  
that the Christ cometh of the seed of David, and from  
Bethlehem, the village where David was? 43 So there arose a  
division in  
</span>

<span id="page_82">p. 82</span>

the multitude because of him. 44 And some of them would  
have taken him; but no man laid hands on him.  

</div>

When one is in a mixed state of consciousness there is always dissension
and questioning. However when one is born anew into the Christ
consciousness all things are made clear.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"For all shall know me,  
From the least to the greatest of them."  
45 The officers therefore came to the chief priests and  
Pharisees; and they said unto them, Why did ye not bring  
him? 46 The officers answered, Never man so spake. 47 The  
Pharisees therefore answered them, Are ye also led astray?  
48 Hath any of the rulers believed on him, or of the  
Pharisees? 49 But this multitude that knoweth not the law  
are accursed. 50 Nicodemus saith unto them (he that came to  
him before, being one of them), 51 Doth our law judge a  
man, except it first hear from himself and know what he  
doeth. 52 They answered and said unto him, Art thou also of  
Galilee? Search, and see that out of Galilee ariseth no  
prophet.  
</span>

</div>

The "chief priests" of the Pharisaical consciousness are the highest
thoughts in authority in the Pharisaical hierarchy. The "officers" are
thoughts that execute the law. However, when it reaches a certain state
of unfoldment even the Pharisaical mind, which believes in the strict
letter of the law, is open to conviction if it can entertain a higher
truth safely. This is proved by Nicodemus' spiritual conversion. The
Pharisaical side of man's mind in its faithful adherence to religious
forms eventually

<span id="page_83">p. 83</span>

becomes aware of the presence of divine power. This truth was in
evidence when the officers replied, "Never man so spake," revealing that
the higher light of the Christ had found entrance into their
consciousness.
