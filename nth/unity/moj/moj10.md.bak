###  John: Chapter 8 

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">53 \[And they went every man unto his own house: 1
but Jesus  
went unto the mount of Olives. 2 And early in the morning  
he came again into the temple, and all the people came unto  
him; and he sat down, and taught them. 3 And the scribes  
and the Pharisees bring a woman taken in adultery; and  
having set her in the midst, 4 they say unto him, Teacher,  
this woman hath been taken in adultery, in the very act. 5  
Now in the law Moses commanded us to stone such: what then  
sayest thou of her? 6 And this they said, trying him, that  
they might have whereof to accuse him. But Jesus stooped  
down, and with his finger wrote on the ground. 7 But when  
they continued asking him, he lifted up himself, and said  
unto them, He that is without sin among you, let him first  
cast a stone at her. 8 And he again stooped down, and with  
his finger wrote on the ground. 9 And they, when they heard  
it, went out one by one, beginning from the eldest, even  
unto the last: and Jesus was left alone, and the woman,  
where she was, in the midst. 10 And Jesus lifted up  
himself, and said unto her, Woman, where are they? did no  
man condemn thee? 11 And she said, No man, Lord. And Jesus  
said, Neither do I condemn thee: go thy way; from  
henceforth sin no more.\]  
</span>

</div>

JESUS' GOING UP into the Mount of Olives means the soul's ascending to
the state of consciousness where absolute Truth is manifest and from
this high vantage point teaching a lesson in brotherly love to the
intellectual faculties. Sometimes the intellectual faculties imagine
they are in supreme authority, as in this case, where the woman caught
in adultery is presented as an example. "Now, spiritual man, what are
you going to do about that?

<span id="page_85">p. 85</span>

Under the law, we are told, we must stone her." Jesus, here symbolizing
the indwelling Christ, writes on the ground and says, "He that is
without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her." The
intellectual faculties, thus trapped in their own conceit, slink away.

The Christ questions this adulterous state of consciousness: "Woman,
where are they? did no man condemn thee?" The reply is "No man, Lord."
The final injunction is "Neither do I condemn thee: go thy way; from
henceforward sin no more." Thus the overcoming power of the Christ Mind
is doing its perfect work.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">12 Again therefore Jesus spake unto them, saying, I
am the  
light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in  
the darkness, but shall have the light of life. 13 The  
Pharisees therefore said unto him, Thou bearest witness of  
thyself; thy witness is not true. 14 Jesus answered and  
said unto them, Even if I bear witness of myself, my  
witness is true; for I know whence I came, and whither I  
go; but ye know not whence I come, or whither I go. 15 Ye  
judge after the flesh; I judge no man. 16 Yet and if I  
judge, my judgment is true; for I am not alone, but I and  
the Father that sent me. 17 Yea and in your law it is  
written, that the witness of two men is true. 18 I am he  
that beareth witness of myself, and the Father that sent me  
beareth witness of me. 19 They said therefore unto him,  
Where is thy Father? Jesus answered, Ye know neither me,  
nor my Father: if ye knew me, ye would know my Father also.  
20 These words spake he in the treasury, as he taught in  
the temple: and no man took him; because his hour was not  
yet come.  
</span>

</div>

<span id="page_86">p. 86</span>

The Christ within is always declaring, "I am the light of the world: he
that followeth me shall not walk in the darkness, but shall have the
light of life." The first lesson in spiritual development to be learned
is that everyone has within him the light of divine understanding. Those
who do not recognize that they have this inner light are thinking
intellectually instead of spiritually. The Christ light comes forth from
God and under all circumstances is aware of its source. It places all
judgment in the Father, knowing that its light is from that source
alone. The intellectual man has no conception of this truth but depends
more on man-made judgment.

Jesus (symbolizing the Christ) was working in the substance
consciousness and under the light of Spirit and was master of the
situation. Therefore no man took Him, because His hour was not yet come.
He put all protection under God, who was ever-present as His witness and
defense.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">21 He said therefore again unto them, I go away, and
ye  
shall seek me, and shall die in your sin: whither I go, ye  
cannot come. 22 The Jews therefore said, Will he kill  
himself, that he saith, Whither I go, ye cannot come? 23  
And he said unto them, Ye are from beneath; I am from  
above: ye are of this world; I am not of this world. 24 I  
said therefore unto you, that ye shall die in your sins:  
for except ye believe that I am he, ye shall die in your  
sins. 25 They said therefore unto him, Who art thou? Jesus  
said unto them, Even that which I have also spoken unto you  
from the beginning. 26 I have many things to speak and to  
judge concerning you: howbeit he that sent me is true; and  
the things which I heard from him, these speak I unto the  
world. 27 They perceived not that he  
</span>

<span id="page_87">p. 87</span>

spake to them of the Father. 28 Jesus therefore said, When  
ye have lifted up the Son of man, then shall ye know that I  
am he, and that I do nothing of myself, but as the Father  
taught me, I speak these things. 29 And he that sent me is  
with me; he hath not left me alone; for I do always the  
things that are pleasing to him. 30 As he spake these  
things, many believed on him.  

</div>

Jesus, symbolizing the I AM, the Christ, again is proclaiming Truth from
the absolute standpoint. As He persists the light of Christ eventually
does filter into consciousness. Through self-righteous adherence to
outer forms man resists his true unfoldment or evolution. The
egotistical personality assumes that its world of phenomena is real and
that all talk about disappearing into spirit is illusion.
Sanctimoniousness develops from the belief that intellect can be
spiritually sanctified. The spiritual mind (the I AM) is the Saviour and
is working to come into evidence. It is working to redeem the
self-righteous, Pharisaical, intellectual man. When this man has been
lifted up, "then shall ye know that I am he, and that I do nothing of
myself, but as the Father taught me. I speak these things."

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">31 Jesus therefore said to those Jews that had
believed  
him, If ye abide in my word, then are ye truly my  
disciples; 32 and ye shall know the truth, and the truth  
shall make you free. 33 They answered unto him, We are  
Abraham's seed, and have never yet been in bondage to any  
man: how sayest thou, Ye shall be made free? 34 Jesus  
answered them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Every one  
that committeth sin is the bondservant of sin. 35 And the  
bondservant abideth not in the house for ever: the son  
abideth for ever.  
</span>

<span id="page_88">p. 88</span>

36 If therefore the Son shall make you free, ye shall be  
free indeed.  

</div>

An understanding of Truth comes only to those who abide faithfully in
the teachings of Jesus. They alone are free who persist in holding to
the true view of life, regardless of preaccepted theories, and who obey
only the voice of the higher self, which holds them to an unswerving
performance of the right, both mental and outer, instead of following
the voice of their own desires.

The subject of freedom is inexhaustible. The quest of freedom is endless
and is unfulfilled save in the Christ consciousness. The Jews did not
understand the teachings of Jesus on this subject. As the chosen people,
they were in bondage to racial pride, and their intemperance in this
regard was difficult to uproot.

The "house" is man's body. No one who allows intemperate desires to rule
his life and to gain expression through his thought and conduct can hope
to remain long in the body or to experience in it any measure of true
satisfaction. Only the "Son," the self-forgetting, loving, helpful
concentration of all the powers on the gaining of a higher understanding
of the forces that control mankind, can bring full and complete freedom.
Once this power of concentration is gained and practiced, perfect
freedom is indeed assured. But concentration does not spring, perfect
and full-fledged, from beneath the fleeting wing of the random resolve;
it requires the faithful giving of oneself to the practice of the
presence

<span id="page_89">p. 89</span>

of God. "Abideth" entails a continuing in the Christ state of mind and
heart.

Jesus in effect said, "If you live in the spirit of My teachings, you
will become truly My disciples, and you will be freed from all your
limitations through the understanding of Truth that comes to you as the
result of your steadfastness."

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">37 I know that ye are Abraham's seed: yet ye seek to
kill  
me, because my word hath not free course in you. 38 I speak  
the things which I have seen with my Father: and ye also do  
the things which ye heard from your father. 39 They  
answered and said unto him, Our father is Abraham. Jesus  
saith unto them, If ye were Abraham's children, ye would do  
the works of Abraham. 40 But now ye seek to kill me, a man  
that hath told you the truth, which I heard from God: this  
did not Abraham. 41 Ye do the works of your father. They  
said unto him, We were not born of fornication; we have one  
Father, even God.  
</span>

</div>

Those who think of themselves as descended from human ancestors are in
bondage to all the limitations of those ancestors, regardless of their
claims to the contrary. It is a falling short of the full stature of man
to regard himself as descended from the human family. This is a sin that
keeps the majority of men in bondage to sense consciousness. The Jews
were proud of their ancestors, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, who did things
that in our day would make them candidates for the penitentiary.
Polygamy might be mentioned as an example.

The worship of ancestors is observed in our own day by those who eagerly
search the records of royalty

<span id="page_90">p. 90</span>

for a family coat of arms or trace their ancestry back to William the
Conqueror. The one and only way to get free of this burden of race
heredity is to proclaim your divine sonship. If you believe that God is
your Father, acknowledge Him, and He will acknowledge you.

A short definition of sin is ignorance. If you knew your spiritual
origin and all the purity and power that it includes, you would not be
subject to the race tendencies that sway the mind of the flesh. This is
the freedom of the Son of God; the shackles of false thoughts are
loosed, and there is the open light of heaven instead of the darkness of
sense consciousness.

It seems incredible that men should seek to destroy and kill out of
their thoughts this super-conscious mind, but such is the
self-sufficiency of ignorance identified with human lineage. Mortality
has failed generation after generation, yet men cling to it as the
summum bonum of existence, and antagonize the Spirit.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">42 Jesus said unto them, If God were your Father, ye
would  
love me: for I came forth and am come from God; for neither  
have I come of myself, but he sent me. 43 Why do ye not  
understand my speech? Even because ye cannot hear my word.  
44 Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your  
father it is your will to do. He was a murderer from the  
beginning, and standeth not in the truth, because there is  
no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his  
own: for he is a liar, and the father thereof. 45 But  
because I say the truth, ye believe me not. 46 Which of you  
convicteth me of sin? If I say  
</span>

<span id="page_91">p. 91</span>

truth, why do ye not believe me? 47 He that is of God  
heareth the words of God: for this cause ye hear them not,  
because ye are not of God. 48 The Jews answered and said  
unto him, Say we not well that thou art a Samaritan, and  
hast a demon? 49 Jesus answered, I have not a demon; but I  
honor my Father, and ye dishonor me. 50 But I seek not mine  
own glory: there is one that seeketh and judgeth.  

</div>

It is hard for the intellect to realize the spiritual "I AM THAT I AM."
It always argues back and forth, endeavoring to prove that the intellect
itself is the highest authority.

Jesus condemned the sins of the intellect, of which self-righteousness
is the greatest, as worse than moral sins. Compare this scathing
arraignment of the arrogant Jews with the ready forgiveness for the
adulteress. The pompous ecclesiastical dignitary is much harder to reach
with Truth than the repentant moral sinner.

Any thought that does not have its origin in the one divine source is a
liar and the father of all lies.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">51 Verily, verily, I say unto you. If a man keep my
word,  
he shall never see death. 52 The Jews said unto him, Now we  
know that thou hast a demon. Abraham died, and the  
prophets; and thou sayest, If a man keep my word, he shall  
never taste of death. 53 Art thou greater than our father  
Abraham, who died? and the prophets died: whom makest thou  
thyself? 54 Jesus answered, If I glorify myself, my glory  
is nothing: it is my Father that glorifieth me; of whom ye  
say, that he is your God; 55 and ye have not known him: but  
I know him; and if I should say, I know him not, I shall be  
like unto you, a liar:  
</span>

<span id="page_92">p. 92</span>

but I know him, and keep his word. 56 Your father Abraham  
rejoiced to see my day; and he saw it, and was glad. 57 The  
Jews therefore said unto him, Thou art not yet fifty years  
old, and hast thou seen Abraham? 58 Jesus said unto them,  
Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham was born, I  
am. 59 They took up stones therefore to cast at him: but  
Jesus hid himself, and went out of the temple.  

</div>

"Verily, verily, I say unto you, If a man keep my word, he shall never
see death. The Jews said unto him, Now we know that thou hast a demon.
Abraham died, and the prophets; and thou sayest, If a man keep my word,
he shall never taste of death."

If the would-be overcomer will diligently meditate on these words, the
light of Truth will gradually break in. Then he will know that the
Christ, the I AM THAT I AM, was before Abraham and also that the old
"church father" Abraham was spiritually quickened to the degree that he
was constantly seeking the light. "Your father Abraham rejoiced to see
my day; and he saw it, and was glad."

It was the Christ in Jesus who exclaimed, "Before Abraham was born, I
am." Christ, the spiritual man, spoke often through Jesus, the natural
man. We know that Christ, the spiritual man, could not have experienced
death, burial, and resurrection. The experiences were possible only to
the mortal man, who was passing from the natural to the spiritual plane
of consciousness.

The word of God is the word that conveys to the world the ideas of the
Most High. It is not the Most High in His wholeness, but it carries with
it

<span id="page_93">p. 93</span>

the power behind the throne, because "the three agree in one," the
Father (principle), the Son (the ideal), and the Holy Ghost, (the
formative word).

Jesus said, "If a man keep my word, he shall never see death." The
"word" here referred to is not comprehended by the spoken or written
word of Jesus but rather the original creative Word of God, the Logos.
This is the Logos or God Word that the Gospel of John states "became
flesh, and dwelt among us (and we beheld his glory, glory as of the only
begotten from the Father)." According to the Bible, the words of Jesus
were more powerful than those of any other man who ever lived. He
infused the divine-life idea into His words until they made direct union
with the creative Word of the Father.

When man in faith makes this intimate connection between his mind and
the Father's, he enters into what may be termed the "river of life," and
he has ability to take others with him into the waters that cleanse,
purify, and vitalize so perfectly that death is swallowed up in life and
man lives right on without the tragedy of death. Such a man was, and is,
Jesus the Christ, and the promise is that all who incorporate in mind
and body the living creative Word, as He did, will with Him escape
death. This promise of the overcoming power of the Word has been
interpreted to mean death of the soul after physical death, but there is
no foundation for this assumption. Jesus overcame death of the body. His
followers are expected to do the same.
