###  John: Chapter 16 

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">These things have I spoken unto you, that ye should
not be  
caused to stumble. 2 They shall put you out of the  
synagogues: yea, the hour cometh, that whosoever killeth  
you shall think that he offereth service unto God. 3 And  
these things will they do, because they have not known the  
Father, nor me. 4 But these things have I spoken unto you,  
that when their hour is come, ye may remember, how that I  
told you. And these things I said not unto you from the  
beginning, because I was with you. 5 But now I go unto him  
that sent me; and none of you asketh me, Whither goest  
thou? 6 But because I have spoken these things unto you,  
sorrow hath filled your heart.  
</span>

</div>

JUST AS JESUS knew He was persecuted and would be persecuted so He knew
that His followers would be persecuted. The ignorant persecute those
whom they do not understand or revere.

The Pharisaical or worldly state of mind has no conception of the higher
realm within but thinks it governs the whole man and is jealous of any
attempt to usurp its power. Hence persecution follows.

While Jesus knew that His apostles did not fully comprehend all that He
said, He was encouraging them to go forth in their spiritual strength
and to travel the road that was ahead of them.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">7 Nevertheless I tell you the truth: It is expedient
for  
you that I go away; for if I go not away, the Comforter  
will not come unto you; but if I go, I will send him unto  
you. 8 And he, when he is come, will convict the world in  
respect of sin, and of righteousness,  
</span>

<span id="page_143">p. 143</span>

and of judgment: 9 of sin, because they believe not on me;  
10 of righteousness, because I go to the Father, and ye  
behold me no more; 11 of judgment, because the prince of  
this world hath been judged. 12 I have yet many things to  
say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now. 13 Howbeit when  
he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he shall guide you into  
all the truth: for he shall not speak from himself; but  
what things soever he shall hear, these shall he speak: and  
he shall declare unto you the things that are to come.  

</div>

Jesus understood that the apostles must make their own demonstration and
could not lean on Him. Therefore He directed them to the Holy Comforter
or Holy Spirit, which is the law of God in action and the one supreme
teacher. Eventually this Spirit leads us into all Truth. "One jot or one
tittle shall in no wise pass away from the law." Justice and
righteousness must be meted out. The Holy Spirit is the Comforter or
God's love in action, which like a mother guides and helps and forgives
all who seek her.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">14 He shall glorify me: for he shall take of mine,
and  
shall declare it unto you. 15 All things whatsoever the  
Father hath are mine: therefore said I, that he taketh of  
mine, and shall declare it unto you.  
</span>

</div>

The Holy Spirit is the dispenser of divine substance, and all prosperity
demonstrations are made through Him. The widow's mite was more than the
gift of the rich because the widow had blessed it and it was her all. It
is not the size of the object but the blessing behind it that counts.
Like the little

<span id="page_144">p. 144</span>

children blessed by Jesus, the mite, being blessed, increases mightily.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">16 A little while, and ye behold me no more; and
again a  
little while, and ye shall see me. 17 some of his disciples  
therefore said one to another, What is this that he saith  
unto us, A little while, and ye behold me not; and again a  
little while, and ye shall see me: and, Because I go to the  
Father? 18 They said therefore, What is this that he saith,  
A little while? We know not what he saith. 19 Jesus  
perceived that they were desirous to ask him, and he said  
unto them, Do ye inquire among yourselves concerning this,  
that I said, A little while, and ye behold me not, and  
again a little while, and ye shall see me? 20 Verily,  
verily, I say unto you, that ye shall weep and lament, but  
the world shall rejoice: ye shall be sorrowful, but your  
sorrow shall be turned into joy. 21 A woman when she is in  
travail hath sorrow, because her hour is come: but when she  
is delivered of the child, she remembereth no more the  
anguish, for the joy that a man is born into the world. 22  
And ye therefore now have sorrow: but I will see you again,  
and your heart shall rejoice, and your joy no one taketh  
away from you.  
</span>

The Christ always goes into the secret place by Himself in order to hold
for greater strength and illumination, and when He attains this strength
and illumination He comes out and demonstrates what He has received from
the Father. Our thoughts get panicky and don't understand, and each time
the Christ withdraws in order to receive new inspiration from God they
are sorrowful; but when He comes forth and demonstrates, their sorrow is
turned into joy. Ultimately they will come into the light of

<span id="page_145">p. 145</span>

Truth and understand what the indwelling Christ demonstrates when He
goes into the silence to renew His strength. This is also true of the
individual who is trying to "put on Christ."

Spiritual perception reveals to us that we are not persons but ideas in
the cosmic Mind.

Jesus knew that the hour for His crucifixion was approaching.
Crucifixion means the giving up of the whole personality. This was the
demonstration that the Master was facing. However, He knew His spiritual
power, and He was well aware that He would rise from the dead, would
again be with His disciples, and would be more able than ever to
instruct them in the mysteries of Being. "I will see you again."

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">23 And in that day ye shall ask no question.
Verily,  
verily, I say unto you, If ye shall ask anything of the  
Father, he will give it you in my name. 24 Hitherto have ye  
asked nothing in my name: ask, and ye shall receive, that  
your joy may be made full. 25 These things have I spoken  
unto you in dark sayings: the hour cometh, when I shall no  
more speak unto you in dark sayings, but shall tell you  
plainly of the Father. 26 In that day ye shall ask in my  
name: and I say not unto you, that I will pray the Father  
for you; 27 for the Father himself loveth you, because ye  
have loved me, and have believed that I came forth from the  
Father. 28 I came out from the Father, and am come into the  
world: again, I leave the world, and go unto the Father. 29  
His disciples say, Lo, now speakest thou plainly, and  
speakest no dark sayings. 30 Now know we that thou knowest  
all things, and needest not that any man should ask thee:  
by this we believe that thou camest  
</span>

<span id="page_146">p. 146</span>

forth from God. 31 Jesus answered them, Do ye now believe?  
32 Behold, the hour cometh, yea, is come, that ye shall be  
scattered, every man to his own, and shall leave me alone:  
and yet I am not alone, because the Father is with me. 33  
These things have I spoken unto you, that in me ye may have  
peace. In the world ye have tribulation: but be of good  
cheer; I have overcome the world.  

</div>

"In that day ye shall ask me no question" means that the apostles would
have unfolded to the point where they would understand the laws of
Spirit and would be able to read out of the law for themselves.

The "dark sayings" refers to the darkened consciousness that cannot see
the true light. But this Scripture indicates that "the night is far
spent, and the day is at hand." The apostles are coming into a great
illumination and will be able to go direct to the Father for light and
guidance and power. Hitherto the apostles have been students. Now they
are to come into a consciousness in which they can tap the great
universal reservoir and receive therefrom. They are to realize that
Omniscience knows all things, and they have only to unify their
consciousness with that of Omnipresence in order to enter into the state
where the true light leads into perfect understanding.

(See John 14:12-14 for further interpretation.)
