###  John: Chapter 20 

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Now on the first day of the week cometh Mary
Magdalene  
early, while it was yet dark, unto the tomb, and seeth the  
stone taken away from the tomb. 2 She runneth therefore,  
and cometh to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple whom  
Jesus loved, and saith unto them, They have taken away the  
Lord out of the tomb, and we know not where they have laid  
him. 3 Peter therefore went forth, and the other disciple,  
and they went toward the tomb. 4 And they ran both  
together: and the other disciple outran Peter, and came  
first to the tomb; 5 and stooping and looking in, he seeth  
the linen cloths lying; yet entered he not in. 6 Simon  
Peter therefore also cometh, following him, and entered  
into the tomb; and he beholdeth the linen cloths lying, 7  
and the napkin, that was upon his head, not lying with the  
linen cloths, but rolled up in a place by itself. 8 Then  
entered in therefore the other disciple also, who came  
first to the tomb, and he saw, and believed. 9 For as yet  
they knew not the scripture, that he must rise again from  
the dead. 10 So the disciples went away again unto their  
own home.  
11 But Mary was standing without at the tomb weeping: so,  
as she wept, she stooped and looked into the tomb; 12 and  
she beholdeth two angels in white sitting, one at the head,  
and one at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain. 13  
And they say unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? She saith  
unto them, Because they have taken away my Lord, and I know  
not where they have laid him. 14 When she had thus said,  
she turned herself back, and beholdeth Jesus standing, and  
knew not that it was Jesus. 15 Jesus saith unto her, Woman,  
why weepest thou? whom seekest thou? She, supposing him to  
be the gardener, saith unto him, Sir, if thou hast borne  
him hence, tell me where thou hast laid him, and I will  
take him away. 16 Jesus saith unto her, Mary. She  
</span>

<span id="page_167">p. 167</span>

turneth herself, and saith unto him in Hebrew, Rabboni;  
which is to say, Teacher. 17 Jesus saith to her, Touch me  
not; for I am not yet ascended unto the Father: but go unto  
my brethren, and say to them, I ascend unto my Father and  
your Father, and my God and your God. 18 Mary Magdalene  
cometh and telleth the disciples, I have seen the Lord; and  
that he had said these things unto her.  

</div>

ON THE RESURRECTION morning the friends and followers of Jesus seemed to
have forgotten His promise that He would rise from the dead, and they
looked for His body in the tomb. This incident shows that when the
belief in death has overshadowed us, it darkens our understanding; we
must pass from under this cloud before we can be conscious of the
presence of awakened life. Mary was searching for her Lord and Master in
the tomb even while He was at her side. John and Peter, failing to find
Him where they expected Him to be, "went away again unto their own
home."

Don't look in the tomb for the one you loved. Spirit is not confined in
the chambers of the dead. When we fail to realize the new life in Christ
we are sorrowful indeed. It is then that we should turn back to Christ
Jesus (the I AM) who stands nearby and who says to the soul, "Why
weepest thou? whom seekest thou?" Grief and the search for the lost one
in some external place are then done away with quickly. The ascending
thought of the I AM is the saving idea. "I ascend unto my Father and
your Father, and my God and your God."

<span id="page_168">p. 168</span>

A resurrection takes place in us every time we thus rise to a
realization of the perpetual indwelling life that connects us with the
Father. We leave in the tomb of matter the graveclothes of mortal sense
(the sense of being mortal), which are thoughts of man's limitation and
inevitable subjection to material laws. Material laws are the laws that
man has made for himself and his world.

The I AM is Spirit, but in order to rise into the realm of pure ideas it
must not be attached to the clinging affections of the soul. (Jesus said
to Mary, "Touch me not.") The two angels, "one at the head, and one at
the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain," represent the positive
words of life that bring spiritual powers to bear that lift the body out
of matter into Spirit. These two bright and shining powers are possessed
of animated intelligence as they say to the weeping Mary: "Why seek ye
the living among the dead? He is not here, but is risen."

The most effective consolation that we can give to those who are
immersed in the grief of separation and loss is to deny for them the
human belief in death and affirm in thought, word and citations of
Scripture the omnipresence of life. This dissipates the flood of sorrow
thoughts that submerges the souls of those who mourn. Jesus did not want
the sorrowing Mary thought to touch Him. The spiritual mind does not
grieve; it does not look to matter and the limitations of the flesh for
life eternal, and it dissipates the thoughts of sorrow by a denial of
their reality or power to affect the mind of the Son of God.

<span id="page_169">p. 169</span>

Always keep to your highest thoughts and deny every suggestion of sorrow
or loss. The children of darkness wear sackcloth and sit in ashes, but
the children of light rejoice, look up ("ascend" in every thought to the
Father of life and light), and are set free thereby from the burden of
grief and from belief in death and separation.

<span class="small">19 When therefore it was evening, on that day, the
first  
day of the week, and when the doors were shut where the  
disciples were, for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood  
in the midst, and saith unto them, Peace be unto you. 20  
And when he had said this, he showed unto them his hands  
and his side. The disciples therefore were glad, when they  
saw the Lord. 21 Jesus therefore said to them again, Peace  
be unto you: as the Father hath sent me, even so send I  
you. 22 And when he had said this, he breathed on them, and  
saith unto them, Receive ye the Holy Spirit: 23 whose  
soever sins ye forgive, they are forgiven unto them; whose  
soever sins ye retain, they are retained.

Christianity began with Jesus Christ, was carried on by the apostles and
the Seventy whom Jesus sent out two by two; then by other persons as
they came into an understanding of Truth. This process of Christianizing
will continue until the entire race is redeemed from error. Even so, as
our faculties, our senses, and our thoughts learn the truth, they in
turn give light and life to the thoughts that are still in darkness. In
this way the entire man becomes established in immortality, eternal
life.

Jesus Christ commissioned His followers to make disciples of all
nations. This commission was given

<span id="page_170">p. 170</span>

to them on a mountain in Galilee. A mountain always symbolizes spiritual
elevation or a high place in consciousness. When the spiritually
awakened and spiritually taught faculties and thoughts assemble with the
I AM in spiritual consciousness, they are sent throughout the entire
man, to the very outermost parts of the body consciousness.

In order to make the world Christian individuals must become Christian.
The Christ Spirit must enter everyone. The Christ is knocking at the
door of every heart, and He will enter when He is invited to come in.
The mind that is open to Truth invites Christ to enter. When all men are
filled with the Christ consciousness, international law will embody the
Christ standard and the Christ kingdom will be established in the earth.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">24 But Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus,
was not  
with them when Jesus came. 25 The other disciples therefore  
said unto him, We have seen the Lord. But he said unto  
them, Except I shall see in his hands the print of the  
nails, and put my finger into the print of the nails, and  
put my hand into his side, I will not believe.  
26 And after eight days again his disciples were within,  
and Thomas with them. Jesus cometh, the doors being shut,  
and stood in the midst, and said, Peace be unto you. 27  
Then saith he to Thomas, Reach hither thy finger, and see  
my hands; and reach hither thy hand, and put it into my  
side: and be not faithless, but believing. 28 Thomas  
answered and said unto him, My Lord and my God. 29 Jesus  
saith unto him, Because thou hast seen me, thou hast  
believed: blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have  
believed.  
</span>

<span id="page_171">p. 171</span>

30 Many other signs therefore did Jesus in the presence of  
the disciples, which are not written in this book: 31 but  
these are written, that ye may believe that Jesus is the  
Christ, the Son of God; and that believing ye may have life  
in his name.  

</div>

Thomas is the apostle of Jesus who represents the understanding faculty
of the natural man. Understanding and will function or should function
in unison; each has its center of activity in the front brain, the
forehead.

Among the apostles of Jesus Thomas stood for the head, representing the
reason and intellectual perception. Jesus did not ignore Thomas's demand
for physical evidence of His identity but respected it. He convinced
Thomas by corporeal evidence that there had been a body resurrection and
that it was not a ghost body that he saw but the same body that had been
crucified, as was evidenced by the wounds that Thomas saw and felt.

The peace of Jesus came through the knowledge that there is no reality
in death but that life is from everlasting to everlasting. He had proved
His power to overcome the last enemy, death, and therefore He was
established in "the peace of God, which passeth all understanding."

Jesus manifested Himself to the Eleven, and He upbraided them for
disbelieving the accounts of His resurrection. Apparently the
resurrection of Jesus is a great mystery, and to those who read the
Bible in the letter and have no discernment of the power of Spirit to
transform the body it must remain a mystery. The question often is asked
whether or not

<span id="page_172">p. 172</span>

we believe that Jesus rose from the dead with the same flesh body in
which He walked the earth and, if so, what became of that body.

In former times believers accepted it as a miracle and made no attempt
to explain the law by which it was accomplished, but blind faith is not
so popular in the church as it once was, and skeptics are more bold. The
school of "high criticism" is openly attacking Bible occurrences that it
cannot account for under natural law. Thinking people are seeking a
comprehensive explanation of the so-called miracles of the Bible. They
wish to know how Jesus did His mighty works, including the resurrection
of His body. The historical account makes clear that the flesh body that
had been crucified was the body that Jesus had after His resurrection.

That Jesus knew how to restore life to dead organs is evidenced by His
healing of paralytics, blind people, and in three cases by raising those
who had died. He knew a way of restoring life that others living in His
age did not know. He tried to explain it to His disciples and
companions, but they did not understand. He told them that He would come
to life again, but they seemed to have no comprehension of what He was
saying. They thought He was talking to them about the Temple at
Jerusalem, but He was talking of His body temple, which He could lay
down and take up at will.

It is not at all surprising that the very near friends of Jesus were
filled with astonishment and fear when they found that He was not in the
tomb where they had laid Him. They could not understand

<span id="page_173">p. 173</span>

that for years He had been training His soul to accomplish this very
thing. He had spent whole nights in prayer, and through the intensity of
His devotions had made union with Divine Mind. This union was so full
and so complete that His whole being was flooded with spiritual life,
power, and substance and the wisdom to use them in divine order. In this
manner He projected the divine-body idea, and through it His mortal body
was transformed into an immortal body. This was accomplished before the
Crucifixion, and Jesus knew that He had so strengthened His soul that it
would restore His body, no matter how harshly the body might be used by
destructive man.

Jesus had obtained power on the three planes of consciousness: the
spiritual, the psychical, and the material. After His resurrection He
held His body on the psychical and the astral planes for forty days, and
then translated it to the spiritual, where it exists to this day as a
body of ethereal substance directed and controlled by His thought and
mind force. Having a body of spiritually electrified atoms, Jesus is
able to quicken the bodies of people who attract His presence by
believing in Him; He radiates a glorious life that energizes those who
believe in His power.

By positive affirmations we must all appropriate this same Christ life,
substance, and Truth as ours individually and as the very foundation and
substance of our body.

Thousands in this day have found the law that Jesus demonstrated and the
inner meaning of the

<span id="page_174">p. 174</span>

Truth that He taught. They are working, praying, denying, affirming,
concentrating, willing. They are in all ways building up the
perfect-idea body, transforming flesh corruptible into substance
incorruptible. Thus they are following Jesus in the regeneration. When
they have renewed every organ and every part both within and without,
and have put away all evidences of old age, the world at large will
begin to accept their claims as true: that the destiny of all men is to
transform the body of flesh into a body of Spirit and thus immortalize
it. In this manner death is to be overcome and the earth made the
dwelling place of immortal men.

This process of revealing and making use of the hidden forces of nature
has already begun in the use of electricity, the radio, X rays, radar,
and other invisible energies. The discovery that the atom has an
electrical center was the first scientific break into omnipresent
spiritual life. This life will be exploited by men until they exhaust
the capacity of the machines they build to utilize it; then they will
look for more efficient agents, which they will find in the development
of the human body. Man's body directed by his mind is the only dynamo
that can generate life and control it. Men can now build machines that
smash the atom and liberate its latent forces, but the released energy
can destroy the machinery and even the bodies of those who set it free.

Nature has within her all the elements necessary to the construction of
heaven here on the earth and in the ether surrounding the earth. It
won't be long

<span id="page_175">p. 175</span>

before we shall be constructing houses in the air, but we must first
learn how to levitate our body, as did Jesus; then resurrection will be
part of our spiritual evolution and we shall know experimentally what
Jesus meant by His death and resurrection, also just where He lives at
the present time and what is required of us before we can meet Him in
the heavens.
