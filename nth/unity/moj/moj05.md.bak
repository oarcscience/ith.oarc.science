###  John: Chapter 3 

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Now there was a man of the Pharisees, named
Nicodemus, a  
ruler of the Jews: 2 the same came unto him by night, and  
said to him, Rabbi, we know that thou art a teacher come  
from God; for no one can do these signs that thou doest,  
except God be with him.  
</span>

</div>

THIS 3d chapter of John opens with a narrative of Nicodemus, "a ruler of
the Jews," his visit to Jesus "by night" (meaning the darkness of
intellectual understanding), and his confession: "Thou art a teacher
from God; for no one can do these signs that thou doest, except God be
with him."

Jesus told him that he must be "born anew," "of water and the Spirit."
Here is a recognition by the Master of the operation of the divine law
of evolution.

All "inheritance" of ideas and beliefs has a mental basis. We "inherit"
some states of mind from our ancestors. An "inherited" or transmitted
religion is a dark state, if there is no real understanding in it. This
is the Nicodemus mentality. Nicodemus was a Pharisee and a ruler of the
Jews. He represents the Pharisaical side of our mentality that observes
the external forms of religion without understanding their real meaning.
We accept our parents' religious affiliations without giving any thought
to their origin. There was a time when it was considered unfilial and an
evidence of disobedience for the children to join any other church than
that to which their parents belonged. The Jews

<span id="page_34">p. 34</span>

were especially rigid in their adherence to their traditional religion,
and they proudly referred to their fathers Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob,
who were taught of God.

This conservative religious thought preserves the church as an
institution and restrains the individual from becoming religiously
erratic. Nicodemus was a friend of Jesus', but his defense of the Master
was put in the form of a question, reminding the Sanhedrin of the Jewish
law that every man must be heard or given a chance to defend himself
before being condemned. The "ruler of the Jews" did not press his
championship of his friend before the Sanhedrin, and the assistance that
he gave at the tomb of Jesus was safe enough, once the prosecutors and
executioners had finished their work and turned their attention
elsewhere.

Nicodemus was not acquainted with the power of Spirit and really had no
understanding of regeneration, although he was a "teacher of Israel"
(Israel representing thoughts that pertain to the religious department
of the mind).

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">3 Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily,
I say  
unto thee, Except one be born anew, he cannot see the  
kingdom of God. 4 Nicodemus saith unto him, How can a man  
be born when he is old? can he enter a second time into his  
mother's womb, and be born? 5 Jesus answered, Verily,  
verily, I say unto thee, Except one be born of water and  
the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God. 6 That  
which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born  
of the Spirit is spirit. 7 Marvel not that I said unto  
thee, Ye must be born anew. 8 The wind bloweth where it  
</span>

<span id="page_35">p. 35</span>

will, and thou, hearest the voice thereof, but knowest not  
whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every one  
that is born of the Spirit.  

</div>

The Pharisees refused to be baptized by John. They did not consider that
they needed the repentance that he demanded. They thought they were good
enough to take the high places in the kingdom of God because of their
popularly accepted religious supremacy. Many people refuse to deny their
shortcomings. They hold that they are perfect in Divine Mind and that it
is superfluous to deny that which has no existence. But they are still
subject to the appetites and passions of mortality, and will continue to
be until they are "born anew."

The new birth is an uncertainty to the intellectual Christian, hence
there has gradually evolved a popular belief that after death the souls
of those who have accepted the church creed and have been counted
Christians will undergo a change. But in His instructions to Nicodemus
Jesus makes no mention of a resurrection after death as having any part
in the new birth. He cites the ever present though unseen wind as an
illustration of those who are born of Spirit. The new birth is a change
that comes here and now. It has to do with the present man, that he may
be conscious of the "Son of man," who is the real I AM in each
individual. "And no one hath ascended into heaven, but that descended
out of heaven, even the Son of man, who is in heaven."

This chapter of John contains some of the vital truths taught in
Christianity: the evolution of man from natural to spiritual
consciousness, and the incarnation

<span id="page_36">p. 36</span>

of Jesus Christ as the divine pattern for all men who are seeking the
way of life.

Christianity teaches the complete law of evolution as compared with the
partial exposition of the law made by Darwin and associates.
Christianity describes God as Spirit creating by a process comparable to
the mental processes with which we are all familiar. "God said," and
thus God created that which was to appear, God planned man and the
universe, and through His word projected them into creation as ideal
principles and immanent energies acting behind and within all
visibility. But we should remember that Spirit could not emerge from the
formless into the formed without creating relations, which necessitated
laws operating through man and all things as essential factors in an
orderly universe. Thus even God becomes subject to His laws or
commandments. God the universal Spirit first appears as spiritual man.
The next step in evolution is the appearance of the idea of spiritual
man in the natural or Adam man. This man was primitively identified with
an infinite capacity for expansion. When he recognizes his identity as
being that of his source, Spirit, he expands in divine order and brings
forth only good. When he deserts his spiritual anchorage and gives
attention to external experiences and sensations, he falls into a world
in which a diversity of results obtain that he calls good and evil. Thus
man eats "of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil."
In these few words is summed up the fall of man from an Edenic state,
where he had the constant inspiration of creative Mind, to a
consciousness

<span id="page_37">p. 37</span>

of matter and the desperate struggle of personality for existence.

The natural man must evolve into the spiritual. "And as Moses lifted up
the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted
up."

We are told here that "the light is come into the world, and men loved
the darkness rather than the light." World chaos results from the lack
of spiritual light. We may plan peace and achieve it, but if this peace
is not based on divine law, evolving love, and that law incorporated
into the pact of peace as well as into the minds of those who sign that
pact, we shall have no permanent peace.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">9 Nicodemus answered and said unto him, How can
these  
things be?  
</span>

</div>

There is but one real man, the ideal or spiritual man that God created.
Jesus was explaining to Nicodemus the evolution of this spiritual man
from his ideal to his manifest state. Man is fundamentally spiritual and
so remains throughout his various manifestations. He comes out of
heaven, manifests himself as a personality in the earth, and returns to
heaven. The first Adam was in Paradise, and after his fall enough of his
spiritual nature remained to keep him alive. Without this animating
Spirit the whole human family would have perished with the fall of Adam.
Faith in Spirit and the ultimate dominance of the good in man will
finally restore him to the heaven from which he descended.

The new birth is simply the realization by man of

<span id="page_38">p. 38</span>

his spiritual identity, with the fullness of power and glory that
follows.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">10 Jesus answered and said unto him, Art thou the
teacher  
of Israel, and understandest not these things? 11 Verily,  
verily, I say unto thee, We speak that which we know, and  
bear witness of that which we have seen; and ye receive not  
our witness. 12 If I told you earthly things and ye believe  
not, how shall ye believe if I tell you heavenly things? 13  
And no one hath ascended into heaven, but he that descended  
out of heaven, even the Son of man, who is in heaven. 14  
And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even  
so must the Son of man be lifted up; 15 that whosoever  
believeth may in him have eternal life.  
16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only  
begotten Son, that whosoever believeth on him should not  
perish, but have eternal life. 17 For God sent not the Son  
into the world to judge the world; but that the world  
should be saved through him.  
</span>

</div>

"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that
whosoever believeth on him \[His own divine self\] should not perish,
but have eternal life." Not only are we to believe in our own divinity,
but we are to accept the example of that divinity expressed through
Jesus Christ.

To believe in Jesus is to believe that in the regenerate state we are to
be, like Him, "joint-heirs with Christ." This belief must then lead us
to a desire and an effort to attain our inheritance, because then we
know that there is no other thing in the universe worth striving for.
Every person in his real, true self desires to be just as great and just
as good as it is possible for him to be. The open door to the

<span id="page_39">p. 39</span>

attainment of this objective is to believe in one's own divinity and
then to raise oneself to its level by following the example of Jesus.

This text reveals the heart of the glad tidings of Jesus Christ to
mankind. In love God gave His only-begotten Son, the fullness of the
perfect-man idea in Divine Mind, the Christ, to be the true, spiritual
self of every individual. By following Jesus' example of recognizing and
acknowledging the Christ in our every thought, word, and deed, thus
unifying ourselves with His completeness, the outer will become as the
inner; we shall be like Christ; we shall know Him as He is. He who truly
believes "cometh not into judgment, but hath passed out of death into
life."

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">18 He that believeth on him is not judged: he that  
believeth not hath been judged already, because he hath not  
believed on the name of the only begotten Son of God. 19  
And this is the judgment, that the light is come into the  
world, and men loved the darkness rather than the light;  
for their works were evil. 20 For every one that doeth evil  
hateth the light, and cometh not to the light, lest his  
works should be reproved. 21 But he that doeth the truth  
cometh to the light, that his works may be made manifest,  
that they have been wrought in God.  
</span>

</div>

Salvation from the results of error thought begins at once when we have
faith in the power of the Lord Jesus Christ to save us from the
judgment. He comes to us in Spirit to do away with the effects of
transgression of the law. When we perceive the way of righteousness and
Truth and follow it, there comes

<span id="page_40">p. 40</span>

to us a new light, an understanding of the law, and we enter the kingdom
of God here and now. "Even the Son of man, who is in heaven."

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">22 After these things came Jesus and his disciples
into the  
land of Judaea; and there he tarried with them, and  
baptized. 23 And John also was baptizing in AEnon near to  
Salim, because there was much water there: and they came,  
and were baptized. 24 For John was not yet cast into  
prison. 25 There arose therefore a questioning on the part  
of John's disciples with a Jew about purifying. 26 And they  
came unto John, and said to him, Rabbi, he that was with  
thee beyond the Jordan, to whom thou hast borne witness,  
behold, the same baptizeth, and all men come to him. 27  
John answered and said, A man can receive nothing, except  
it have been given him from heaven. 28 Ye yourselves bear  
me witness, that I said, I am not the Christ, but, that I  
am sent before him. 29 He that hath the bride is the  
bridegroom: but the friend of the bridegroom, that standeth  
and heareth him, rejoiceth greatly because of the  
bridegroom's voice: this my joy therefore is made full. 30  
He must increase, but I must decrease.  
31 He that cometh from above is above all: he that is of  
the earth is of the earth, and of the earth he speaketh: he  
that cometh from heaven is above all. 32 What he hath seen  
and heard, of that he beareth witness; and no man receiveth  
his witness. 33 He that hath received his witness hath set  
his seal to this, that God is true. 34 For he whom God hath  
sent speaketh the words of God: for he giveth not the  
Spirit by measure. 35 The Father loveth the Son, and hath  
given all things into his hand. 36 He that believeth on the  
Son hath eternal life; but he that obeyeth not the Son  
shall not see life, but the wrath of God abideth on him.  
</span>

</div>

<span id="page_41">p. 41</span>

Jesus represents the Christ. Judea represents praise. John the Baptist
and Jesus represent co-operation between the intellect and the Spirit.

Metaphysically interpreted, John the Baptist represents the intellectual
concept of Truth and his baptizing means a mental cleansing. The name
Salim means "peace." "Near Salim" signifies the illumined consciousness
of spiritual life and peace in the individual. The water refers to a
natural rising in consciousness of the cleansing power of the thought
and word of purification and life. The Jew symbolizes an inquiring
thought. John candidly explained that he had said before that Jesus was
the Christ, the Saviour, and that he, John, must decrease while the
Christ must increase. However John declared that he truly believed Jesus
to be the Saviour and that all who believed should receive eternal life.
But John must decrease, and yet by his own admission those who believe
are to have everlasting life.

Metaphysically interpreted, John the Baptist (representing the illumined
intellect) decreases on the sense plane in proportion as the intellect
is lifted up in Spirit and is in truth swallowed up in spiritual
consciousness. The faculty decreases on one plane only to be reborn on a
higher one. The illumined intellect wholly co-operates with Spirit, so
there is a merging and blending of these powers until the mere intellect
ceases to be mere intellect and is swallowed up in Spirit. This is the
ideal unfoldment. There are those who are so bound in their own beliefs,
who are so set on the letter of the law, that they think intellectuality
is the highest unfoldment. They

<span id="page_42">p. 42</span>

have not yet attained the ability to perceive or receive the things of
Spirit. Those in the John the Baptist process of unfoldment willingly
cooperate with the Christ every step of the way. The truth is that we
are all under the law of infinite expansion, and the development of the
race must go forward. Therefore, it is said that "the Son of man must be
lifted up."

An example of how the intellect serves may be readily illustrated by the
use of the x in algebra. The x stands for the unknown quantity. When the
problem is worked out the x is erased. Thus the intellect is the tool of
Spirit just as the x is a tool used in the mathematical operation. In
the John the Baptist consciousness we obey and conform our thinking to
the requirements of the spiritual instead of the natural. Spirit life is
something that has enduring qualities. It is superior to the life that
goes and comes through death and rebirth.

When the redeemed intellect is fully merged with the Christ light, then
the indwelling Spirit of truth is free to perform many so-called
miracles. It bridges over difficulties and cements the forces of the
soul into one perfect instrument of God for achieving the glory of God.
When one reaches this plane spiritual unfoldment goes forward by leaps
and bounds.

In order to fulfill the divine law of his being man must realize that he
is the Son of God in manifestation, that he came from above and is above
all; also that in his evolution he leaves the earthly consciousness and
ascends into the spiritual under a law of mind. "He that cometh from
above is above all: he

<span id="page_43">p. 43</span>

that is of the earth is of the earth, and of the earth he speaketh." For
he whom God hath sent speaketh the words of God. "The Father loveth the
Son, and hath given all things into his hand."
