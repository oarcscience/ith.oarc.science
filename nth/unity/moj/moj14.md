###  John: Chapter 12 

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Jesus therefore six days before the passover came
to  
Bethany, where Lazarus was, whom Jesus raised from the  
dead. 2 So they made him a supper there: and Martha served;  
but Lazarus was one of them that sat at meat with him. 3  
Mary therefore took a pound of ointment of pure nard, very  
precious, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his  
feet with her hair: and the house was filled with the odor  
of the ointment.  
</span>

</div>

BETHANY MEANS "a place of fruits," dates, bread, that is, substance.
Whenever we make a mental demonstration we get a certain result in our
body. This is called the "fruit" of our thought.

When Jesus went to Bethany He realized the fruit or effect of raising
Lazarus; that is, the quickening of certain sleeping energies in His
body consciousness.

This realization is a feast to the soul and body, a filling of the whole
man with a sense of satisfaction. Martha, the practical soul, and Mary,
the devotional, serve the Master. Martha provides the material
necessities and Mary the spiritual, while Lazarus sits at meat (abides
as the living substance of the subconsciousness).

Mary, the devotional side of the soul, is grateful for the awakening of
her brother Lazarus, because she depends for her manifestation on the
subconscious life that he represents. When the soul is lifted up in
prayer and thanksgiving, there follows an outflow of love that fills the
whole "house" or body with its odor. The anointing of Jesus' feet
represents the willingness of love to serve. When Jesus

<span id="page_116">p. 116</span>

washed the feet of His apostles He said, "He that is . . . greater among
you, let him become as the younger; and he that is chief, as he that
doth serve."

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">4 But Judas Iscariot, one of his disciples, that
should  
betray him, saith, 5 Why was not this ointment sold for  
three hundred shillings, and given to the poor? 6 Now this  
he said, not because he cared for the poor; but because he  
was a thief, and having the bag took away what was put  
therein. 7 Jesus therefore said, suffer her to keep it  
against the day of my burying. 8 For the poor ye have  
always with you; but me ye have not always.  
9 The common people therefore of the Jews learned that he  
was there: and they came, not for Jesus' sake only, but  
that they might see Lazarus also, whom he had raised from  
the dead. 10 But the chief priests took counsel that they  
might put Lazarus also to death; 11 because that by reason  
of him many of the Jews went away, and believed on Jesus.  
</span>

</div>

Judas Iscariot (sense consciousness) is incarnated selfishness, and his
every thought is to build up personality. When Mary anoints the feet of
Jesus (when love pours out her precious substance, diffusing its essence
throughout the whole man), Judas inquires why the ointment was not sold
and the proceeds given to the poor. The Judas consciousness believes in
poverty and has no understanding of the true law of supply. All that
comes into consciousness is selfishly appropriated and dissipated by
this thief, yet he produces nothing. Sense consciousness is the enigma
of existence, and in it is wrapped up the mystery of individuality.
Jesus knew that through this department of His being He would be
betrayed, but

<span id="page_117">p. 117</span>

He made no effort to defeat the act of Judas. Sense consciousness
betrays man every day, yet it would be unwise wholly to destroy it
before its time, because at its foundation it is good; it has simply
gone wrong; it "hath a devil."

Love is the "greatest thing in the world," according to Henry Drummond,
who analyzed it in a masterly manner. Jesus acknowledged the power of
love when He said, "Suffer her to keep it against the day of my
burying." When personality is hurt to the death and surrenders all, love
pours her balm over every wound and the substance of her sympathy
infuses hope and faith into the discouraged soul. A noted mental healer
relates that her husband was dying of consumption. She had treated him
in every way known to her science without results, when one day in her
agony she exclaimed, "I will give my whole life to save you."
Immediately, she says, a great flood of substance seemed to roll forth
from her heart toward her husband, and from that day he began to
improve, and he finally got well. This was the precious ointment of
love, poured out for him when he was buried in the consciousness of
death, and it resurrected him. Divine Love hath a balm for every ill.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">12 On the morrow a great multitude that had come to
the  
feast, when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,  
13 took the branches of the palm trees, and went forth to  
meet him, and cried out, Hosanna: Blessed is he that cometh  
in the name of the Lord, even the King of Israel. 14 And  
Jesus, having found a young ass, sat thereon; as it is  
written,  
</span>

<span id="page_118">p. 118</span>

15 Fear not, daughter of Zion: behold, thy King cometh,  
sitting on an ass's colt. 16 These things understood not  
his disciples at the first: but when Jesus was glorified,  
then remembered they that these things were written of him,  
and that they had done these things unto him. 17 The  
multitude therefore that was with him when he called  
Lazarus out of the tomb, and raised him from the dead, bare  
witness. 18 For this cause also the multitude went and met  
him, for that they heard that he had done this sign. 19 The  
Pharisees therefore said among themselves, Behold how ye  
prevail nothing; lo, the world is gone after him.  

</div>

The triumphal entry of Jesus into Jerusalem and His reception by the
multitude represents a transient and external enthusiasm, the result of
demonstrations in the outer. This multitude that went forth to meet Him,
crying, "Hosanna: Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord,"
did so because they had witnessed the raising of Lazarus. Their homage
to Jesus was based on the "signs" that they had witnessed, and not on
that deep inner conviction of Truth that attests the sincere followers.

A large proportion of those who espouse the cause in this day do so from
the "signs" standpoint. They have observed some demonstration, and
accept the philosophy as they would a new patent medicine, and they
change their doctrine as readily as the doser does his drug.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">20 Now there were certain Greeks among those that
went up  
to worship at the feast: 21 these therefore came to Philip,  
who was of Bethsaida of Galilee, and asked him, saying,  
Sir, we would see Jesus.  
</span>

<span id="page_119">p. 119</span>

22 Philip cometh and telleth Andrew: Andrew cometh, and  
Philip, and they tell Jesus. 23 And Jesus answereth them,  
saying, The hour is come, that the Son of man should be  
glorified. 24 Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except a  
grain of wheat fall into the earth and die, it abideth by  
itself alone; but if it die, it beareth much fruit. 25 He  
that loveth his life loseth it; and he that hateth his life  
in this world shall keep it unto life eternal. 26 If any  
man serve me, let him follow me; and where I am, there  
shall also my servant be: if any man serve me, him will the  
Father honor.  

</div>

Common sense often saves a man from the fanaticism of religious
enthusiasm. The Greeks represent the practical side of man's nature.
They ask Philip for an interview with Jesus, and Philip tells Andrew.
All this means that it is through the power (Philip) and strength
(Andrew) in man that the sense reason acts, and when the I AM is called
down from its lofty spiritual enthronement to the contemplation of
practical life, there is a restoration of equilibrium. Then it
recognizes the law of giving its exalted ideality to the earthly
consciousness, that it may also be lifted up. To the higher
consciousness this seems like the death of an ideal, but it is only a
temporary submergence, which has its resurrection in a great increase of
life and power. Thus we lose our life in the service of the good, and
count it of no value in order to find it again in Spirit.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">27 Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say?
Father,  
save me from this hour. But for this cause came I unto this  
hour. 28 Father, glorify thy  
</span>

<span id="page_120">p. 120</span>

name. There came therefore a voice out of heaven, saying, I  
have both glorified it, and will glorify it again. 29 The  
multitude therefore, that stood by, and heard it, said that  
it had thundered: others said, An angel hath spoken to him.  
30 Jesus answered and said, This voice hath not come for my  
sake, but for your sakes.  

</div>

Jesus' mission on earth was to save the race from bondage, from sin,
sickness, and death. This Scripture reveals that Jesus had been able to
realize the Truth in this regard and that the time was now approaching
for the demonstration. In the face of it all, He realized He was on new
ground and there was that within Him which was troubled. "Father, save
me from this hour. But for this cause came I unto this hour. Father,
glorify thy name." From within Him came the reassuring voice of God: "I
have both glorified it \[the name\] and will glorify it again." This
means that Jesus' heavenly credentials were sufficient and that there
was nothing to fear. The demonstration must eventually be forthcoming.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">31 Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the
prince  
of this world be cast out. 32 And I, if I be lifted up from  
the earth, will draw all men unto myself. 33 But this he  
said, signifying by what manner of death he should die. 34  
The multitude therefore answered him, We have heard out of  
the law that the Christ abideth for ever: and how sayest  
thou, The Son of man must be lifted up? who is this Son of  
man? 35 Jesus therefore said unto them, Yet a little while  
is the light among you. Walk while ye have the light, that  
darkness overtake you not: and he that walketh in the  
darkness knoweth not whither he goes. 36 While ye have the  
light,  
</span>

<span id="page_121">p. 121</span>

believe on the light, that ye may become sons of light.  

</div>

The multitude here referred to is the multitude of thoughts within the
soul that is endeavoring to lay hold of the laws of spirituality. Jesus'
admonition was "Yet a little while is the light among you. Walk while ye
have the light, that darkness overtake you not."

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">36 These things spake Jesus, and he departed and
hid  
himself from them. 37 But though he had done so many signs  
before them, yet they believed not on him: 38 that the word  
of Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spake,  
Lord, who hath believed our report?  
And to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed?  
39 For this cause they could not believe, for that Isaiah  
said again,  
40 He hath blinded their eyes, and he hardened their heart;  
Lest they should see with their eyes, and perceive with  
their heart,  
And should turn,  
And I should heal them.  
41 These things said Isaiah, because he saw his glory; and  
he spake of him. 42 Nevertheless even of the rulers many  
believed on him; but because of the Pharisees they did not  
confess it, lest they should be put out of the synagogue:  
43 for they loved the glory that is of men more than the  
glory that is of God.  
</span>

</div>

By a "prophet" within the soul is understood the capacity to read out of
the law and to perceive to what degree the soul can really demonstrate
spirituality. It is revealed that in this Scripture the Pharisaical

<span id="page_122">p. 122</span>

intellect was in authority, compelling the soul forces that were
beginning to understand Truth but that still loved the glory that is of
men more than the glory that is of God to do obeisance to it.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">44 And Jesus cried and said, He that believeth on
me,  
believeth not on me, but on him that sent me. 45 And he  
that beholdeth me beholdeth him that sent me. 46 I am come  
a light into the world, that whosoever believeth on me may  
not abide in the darkness. 47 And if any man hear my  
sayings, and keep them not, I judge him not: for I came not  
to judge the world, but to save the world. 48 He that  
rejecteth me, and receiveth not my sayings, hath one that  
judgeth him: the word that I spake, the same shall judge  
him in the last day. 49 For I spake not from myself; but  
the Father that sent me, he hath given me a commandment,  
what I should say, and what I should speak. 50 And I know  
that his commandment is life eternal; the things therefore  
which I speak, even as the Father hath said unto me, so I  
speak.  
</span>

</div>

In this Scripture Jesus (symbolizing the indwelling Christ) is declaring
to the whole soul consciousness that the preponderance of power is
spiritual. Spiritual character is the rock foundation of Being;
therefore He is urging the multitude of thoughts to realize that their
redemption comes through decreeing their oneness with Spirit and that
the will of God is active in consciousness.

The realization of divine unity is the highest that we may attain. This
is true glory, the blending and merging of the whole being in Divine
Mind. "Build yourself into God and you will find yourself in heaven
right here and now."
