###  John: Chapter 14 

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Let not your heart be troubled: believe in God,
believe  
also in me. 2 In my Father's house are many mansions; if it  
were not so, I would have told you; for I go to prepare a  
place for you. 3 And if I go and prepare a place for you, I  
come again, and will receive you unto myself; that where I  
am, there ye may be also.  
</span>

</div>

WE BELIEVE IN God. It follows logically that we believe also in the
manifestation of God, the ideal man. This proposition once accepted,
there dawns on the understanding the truth of an intimate relation
existing between Father and Son. The Father, God, "Spirit," is within
the Son as the animating principle. The full recognition by man of this
indwelling Spirit, as it was in Jesus, makes man the central figure and
ruling power in the manifest universe. "The kingdom of God is within
you."

"Many mansions" means many abiding places. "Mansion" comes from the
Latin manere, to remain. The meaning of Jesus was that He was making a
permanent abiding place for those who believed in His teaching and
accepted Him for what He really was--God manifest. The idea usually held
out is that Jesus was preceding His disciples to heaven, where He would
await and welcome them. But there is no such meaning in the text. The
permanent abiding place to which Jesus invites His friends is "prepared"
by Him: He makes the place Himself, in fact He is the place. "Where I
am, there ye may be also:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">4 And whither I go, ye know the way. 5 Thomas  
</span>

<span id="page_131">p. 131</span>

saith unto him, Lord, we know not whither thou goest; how  
know we the way? 6 Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, and  
the truth, and the life: no one cometh unto the Father, but  
by me. 7 If ye had known me, ye would have known my Father  
also: from henceforth ye know him, and have seen him. 8  
Philip saith unto him, Lord, show us the Father, and it  
sufficeth us. 9 Jesus saith unto him, Have I been so long  
time with you, and dost thou not know me, Philip? he that  
hath seen me hath seen the Father; how sayest thou, Show us  
the Father? 10 Believest thou not that I am in the Father,  
and the Father in me? the words that I say unto you I speak  
not from myself: but the Father abiding in me doeth his  
works. 11 Believe me that I am in the Father, and the  
Father in me: or else believe me for the very works' sake.  

</div>

"Whither I go, ye know the way." The intellectual man, Thomas, claims
ignorance and says he does not know the place or the way. Then Jesus
reveals the spiritual Truth to which He has gradually been leading their
minds, saying, "I am the way, and the truth, and the life: no one cometh
unto the Father, but by me." An understanding of man's spiritual nature
reveals his unity with the omnipresent principle of life, the Father.
Jesus the Christ is in the Father, and the Father is in man. Whoever
sees the spirituality of man in himself or others sees the Father. The
Father principle may be so developed in man that it will move him
unerringly in all his ways, and the Father may even speak words through
his mouth. When this point is reached the question of man's unity with
the Father principle is wholly removed, the manifestation of wisdom and

<span id="page_132">p. 132</span>

power in him proving that a higher principle is at work through him.
"Believe me for the very works' sake."

But Philip (the power of the word) says, "Show us the Father." This
faculty must be raised to the realization of the omnipresence of Spirit
by an acknowledgment that the word of the I AM spoken through it is not
of the mortal but of God. "The words that I say unto you I speak not of
myself: but the Father abiding in me, doeth his works."

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">12 Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth
on me,  
the works that I do shall he do also; and greater works  
than these shall he do; because I go unto the Father. 13  
And whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do,  
that the Father may be glorified in the Son. 14 If ye shall  
ask anything in my name, that will I do.  
</span>

</div>

"Whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do." There is no limit
here. "Whatsoever" covers everything. Then why do we not receive at all
times when we ask in His name? Because we have not demonstrated the
power of His name. The name stands for the spiritual man, and it is this
name or sign of God with us that rewards our faith. Had we a check
signed by a well-known financier we should not hesitate to present it at
the bank and get the money. The same confidence in the life-giving and
success-producing power of the risen Christ must be established in us.
When we reach out into the great invisible spiritual substance all about
us and think of ourselves as its expression, confidently expecting it to
manifest itself through us, it will do so. If at the

<span id="page_133">p. 133</span>

first trial we do not succeed, let us keep trying until we do succeed;
for the promise can be proved true, "If ye shall ask anything in my
name, that will I do."

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">15 If ye love me, ye will keep my commandments. 16
And I  
will pray the Father, and he shall give you another  
Comforter, that he may be with you for ever, 17 even the  
Spirit of truth: whom the world cannot receive; for it  
beholdeth him not, neither knoweth him: ye know him; for he  
abideth with you, and shall be in you. 18 I will not leave  
you desolate: I come unto you. 19 Yet a little while, and  
the world beholdeth me no more; but ye behold me: because I  
live, ye shall live also. 20 In that day ye shall know that  
I am in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you. 21 He that  
hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that  
loveth me: and he that loveth me shall be loved of my  
Father, and I will love him, and will manifest myself unto  
him. 22 Judas (not Iscariot) saith unto him, Lord, what is  
come to pass that thou wilt manifest thyself unto us, and  
not unto the world? 23 Jesus answered and said unto him, If  
a man love me, he will keep my word: and my Father will  
love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode  
with him. 24 He that loveth me not keepeth not my words:  
and the word which ye hear is not mine, but the Father's  
who sent me.

In this Scripture Jesus, representing the I AM, gives assurance of
divine co-operation to those who are loyal in thought and word to the
Truth. You now know the relation in which you stand to the Father.
Spiritually you are one, but to sustain this spiritual relation until it
is fully manifested in your body and environment requires attention. The
concrete aspect of Truth, represented by the personality

<span id="page_134">p. 134</span>

of Jesus, must be taken away before you can understand Truth in its
abstract or universal sense. Then withdrawing your attention from the
letter or personality and centering it on Truth in its spiritual
essence, you find that there is an intelligible side to that which seems
vague and indefinite. The Comforter, the Advocate, the Spirit of truth
is omnipresent as divine wisdom and power, which are brought into active
touch with our consciousness through our believing in Him. In "the
world"--on the phenomenal side--we cannot know this guide and helper,
but having learned the truth about the omnipresence of Spirit, with all
the abundance of life, love, Truth, and intelligence through which it is
made manifest, we at once begin to realize that the Mighty One dwells
with us, and "shall be in you."

The going away of the I AM was apparent to sense consciousness only--the
"world beholdeth me no more"--but the larger range of consciousness
beholds an expansion of the sense of divine identity and life, "Ye
behold me: because I live, ye shall live also." With this expansion of
the sense of our divine identity comes a perception of our unity with
the Father, and the absolute identity of our sense-limited I with the
universal I AM, the Christ. "In that day ye shall know that I am in my
Father, and ye in me, and I in you."

The question is frequently asked, Is it not presumptuous for us, who
have at first no realization of their truth, to make the statements that
Jesus made? No, it is not; because in Spirit we are all

<span id="page_135">p. 135</span>

that He claimed for Himself, and in no other way except affirming this
truth can we make it manifest. All who experiment with words find that
they generate force in the mind and eventually affect the body. Jesus
urged His disciples to believe on Him, to keep His commandments, His
sayings, His words, and they went forth and did wonderful works in "the
name of . . . Jesus Christ."

In this Scripture Jesus says that those who keep His commandments thus
show their love for Him and that He will love them and manifest Himself
to them. Understanding as we do the affinity that similar thoughts have
for one another, we perceive why keeping "my word" and believing "in me"
were so powerfully urged by Jesus. He transcended men in His high
statements, and His work corresponded to them, and knowing this law that
like thoughts and words swiftly seek unity, He took advantage of it to
lift us all up to His high standard.

But we must get out of the "world" or letter before we can touch this
spiritual potency. Judas asked why it was that Jesus would manifest
Himself to them and not to the world. Jesus' answer is right in line
with this mental law of words by which the speaker is put in contact
with those who have uttered similar words: "If a man love me, he will
keep my word: and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him,
and make our abode with him. He that loveth me not keepeth not my words:
and the word which ye hear is not mine, but the Father's who sent me."

<span id="page_136">p. 136</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">25 These things have I spoken unto you, while yet
abiding  
with you. 26 But the Comforter, even the Holy Spirit, whom  
the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all  
things, and bring to your remembrance all that I said unto  
you. 27 Peace I leave with you; my peace I give unto you:  
not as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your  
heart be troubled, neither let it be fearful. 28 Ye heard  
how I said to you, I go away, and I come unto you. If ye  
loved me, ye would have rejoiced, because I go unto the  
Father: for the Father is greater than I. 29 And now I have  
told you before it come to pass, that, when it is come to  
pass, ye may believe. 30 I will no more speak much with  
you, for the prince of the world cometh: and he hath  
nothing in me; 31 but that the world may know that I love  
the Father, and as the Father gave me commandment, even so  
I do. Arise, let us go hence.  
</span>

The Father is principle. The Son is this Father principle revealed in a
creative plan. The Holy Spirit is the executive power of both Father and
Son.

The Holy Spirit is not all of Being, nor the fullness of Christ, but an
emanation or "breath" sent forth to do a divine work. Thus
circumscribed, the Holy Spirit may in a sense be said to take on the
characteristics of personality, but personality that for capacity
transcends all man's conceptions.

The Holy Spirit was before the time of Jesus. However Jesus' life and
demonstration gave a new impetus to it. The Holy Spirit or Spirit of
truth is man's one sure guide in his spiritual ongoing. An outpouring of
the Holy Spirit always brings peace and infinite faith in the Father
through the Son.
