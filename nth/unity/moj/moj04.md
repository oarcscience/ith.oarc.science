###  John: Chapter 2 

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">And the third day there was a marriage in Cana of
Galilee;  
and the mother of Jesus was there: 2 and Jesus also was  
bidden, and his disciples, to the marriage. 3 And when the  
wine failed, the mother of Jesus saith unto him, They have  
no wine. 4 And Jesus saith unto her, Woman, what have I to  
do with thee? mine hour is not yet come. 5 His mother saith  
unto the servants, Whatsoever he saith unto you, do it. 6  
Now there were six waterpots of stone set there after the  
Jews' manner of purifying, containing two or three firkins  
apiece. 7 Jesus saith unto them, Fill the waterpots with  
water. And they filled them up to the brim. 8 And he saith  
unto them, Draw out now, and bear unto the ruler of the  
feast. And they bare it. 9 And when the ruler of the feast  
tasted the water now become wine, and knew not whence it  
was (but the servants that had drawn the water knew), the  
ruler of the feast calleth the bridegroom, 10 and saith  
unto him, Every man setteth on first the good wine; and  
when men have drunk freely, then that which is worse: thou  
hast kept the good wine until now. 11 This beginning of his  
signs did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested his  
glory; and his disciples believed on him.

SPIRITUALLY A marriage represents the union of two dominant states of
consciousness. Mary, the mother of Jesus, represents intuition, the
spiritual soul, Eve, "the mother of all living." Jesus is the personal I
AM and His apostles are the twelve faculties.

Cana is a "place of reeds"; so is the larynx found in the body. The name
Galilee means "to whirl"; air is rapidly forced through the larynx in
speaking or singing. The apostles represent the dominant

<span id="page_25">p. 25</span>

nerve centers, the spiritual symbolism of each being concealed in the
name. Philip means "one who is fond of horses." The horse symbolizes
vigor, vitality, power. Vigor or its opposite, weakness, is betrayed by
the voice, so we designate Philip as the power faculty, and his place in
body expression is in the larynx (at Cana).

Water may be compared to natural or human life, and wine to spiritual
life. In the regeneration spirit and body are united, but before this
union can be accomplished the exhausted natural life must be quickened
with spirit (symbolized by the turning of water into wine). This lack of
vitalizing life is first realized by Mary, the source of all life, but
Jesus, the directive I AM in all bodily activities, does not feel that
He is yet ready to perform this seeming miracle and pleads delay: "Mine
hour has not yet come."

But the urge of the inner forces is strong and the confident mother is
sure that her son can do all things: "Whatsoever he saith unto you, do
it."

The water pots filled to the brim with water by the servants represent
the extent to which nature is prepared to fulfill the transformation
from negative life to spiritual life through the power of the word of
the Master, Jesus: "Draw out now, and bear to the ruler of the feast."
The ruler of the feast, the supreme I AM, pronounced the transformed
water to be superior to the best wine.

This transformation of the negative, watery fluid of the organism into
vitalizing Spirit is accomplished by adding to every word a spiritual
idea. The idea of omnipresent life will then quicken the natural life

<span id="page_26">p. 26</span>

in man, and it will make conscious contact with the one life and draw it
out for the benefit of the many.

When the I is "lifted up" there is a higher vital action imparted to the
whole consciousness. Jesus said, "I, if I be lifted up from the earth,
will draw all men unto myself." The lifting up of the I is the result of
spiritual perception of Truth. When we discern the real truth of being
and our relation to it, there is a new and higher consciousness
established. This greater energy is first imparted to the soul or
thought realm and through it to the body. This whole process is under
law. There is a definite consecutive connection of thought and thing,
through laws that may be discerned by man and used universally. At the
close of chapter 1, Jesus had caught sight of the spiritual realm and
said: "Ye shall see the heaven opened, and the angels of God ascending
and descending upon the Son of man."

This high perception of man's union, through the I AM, with the divine
harmony sets up a sympathetic vibration that is imparted to every part
of consciousness. The marriage that took place in Cana of Galilee
symbolizes this union in which the negative watery elements of the body
were "lifted up" to wine or Spirit. A Bible authority says that His
remark is more correctly stated in the words: "Woman, what is there
between me and thee?" This interrogation depicts the questioning
attitude of the personal I AM, Jesus. It is not clear in its
understanding of what is to be done. It is looking forward to a time
when it will act, but its "hour is not yet come." We find ourselves
wanting to see all the

<span id="page_27">p. 27</span>

steps of our actions before we begin, but in spiritual processes we have
to proceed without foreknowing the various steps. If we go ahead and
speak the word, the law will see us through. The elemental forces of
Being (servants) are at hand to carry out our orders, and the intuitive
perfection of Truth (woman) within us commands that those forces do our
bidding.

The symbolism of this miracle has to do with the abundance of vital
energy that may be generated from a union of man with the "water of
life" or nerve substance in the various centers of his organism. With
every thought we are putting the nerve substance into a state of action,
and it rushes to any part of the body that is the center of attention.
When we have been much excited or interested there is a concentration of
vitality in the head, and if we do not know how to restore and equalize
this vitality again in the body, we have a headache or the stuffy
condition called a cold. To equalize: Center the attention in the larynx
and declare, "All equalizing, harmonizing power is given unto me in mind
and body."

In regeneration there is a permanent transmutation of physical vitality
into higher consciousness, and a new element is introduced into the
organism. "The ruler of the feast" (the Lord) praises the transmuted
substance as the best offered at the wedding feast.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">12 After this he went down to Capernaum, he, and
his  
mother, and his brethren, and his disciples; and there they  
abode not many days.  
</span>

</div>

<span id="page_28">p. 28</span>

Capernaum designates or represents an inner conviction of the abiding
compassion and restoring power of Being. When one enters this state of
consciousness a healing virtue pours out of the soul and transforms all
discord into harmony.

Jesus and His mother and His brethren and His disciples went into this
state of consciousness.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">13 And the passover of the Jews was at hand, and
Jesus went  
up to Jerusalem.  
</span>

</div>

It is the nature of thought to repeat itself. At each repetition it will
grow stronger or weaker as it is consciously recognized or ignored by
man. Thus we can cultivate a good movement of the mind by giving it a
special affirmation (feast). The Feast of the Passover that Jesus went
up to Jerusalem to attend symbolizes an escape from bondage. When we
begin to discipline our mind we always go up in consciousness, because
it is from our spiritual height that we see things clearly and in their
right relation.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">14 And he found in the temple those that sold oxen
and  
sheep and doves, and the changers of money sitting.  
</span>

</div>

When we throw the light of Spirit into the subconscious courts of the
body temple, we find queer and often startling conditions there. One
would hardly expect to see butcher stalls and money-changers in a temple
built for the worship of God, yet similar conditions exist in all of us.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">15 And he made a scourge of cords, and cast all out
of the  
temple, both the sheep and the oxen; and  
</span>

<span id="page_29">p. 29</span>

he poured out the changers' money, and overthrew their  
tables; 16 and to them that sold doves he said, Take these  
things hence; make not my Father's house a house of  
merchandise.  

</div>

So the body temple must be cleansed; it is the house of God ("for we are
a temple of the living God"), and it should be put in order. The first
step in this cleansing process is to recognize its need. The next step
is the "scourge of small cords" (A.V.): to formulate the word or
statement of denial. When we deny in general terms we cleanse the
consciousness, but secret sins may yet lurk in the inner parts. The
words that most easily reach these hidden errors are not great ones,
such as "I am one with Almightiness; my environment is God" but small,
definite statements that cut like whipcords into the sensuous, fleshly
mentality.

To get perfect results it is necessary to deal with our mind in both the
absolute and the relative. In the early morning we may affirm, "All the
affairs of my life are under the law of justice, and my own comes to me
in ways divine," and before noon find ourselves searching the papers for
advertisements of bargains in the stores. Such an experience shows that
we have not gone into the temple and tipped over the tables and
scattered the coins.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">17 His disciples remembered that it was written,
Zeal for  
thy house shall eat me up.  
/text  
Excessive zeal in observing the forms of religious worship  
eats up the truly spiritual. "The zeal of thine house hath  
eaten me up." When we become  
</span>

<span id="page_30">p. 30</span>

very zealous in observing the rites of the church, we are  
prone to forget the church itself, which is Christ.  
The light of Jesus Christ is, symbolically, the life of  
everyone who enters the same state of mind that He did. You  
always reap the consequences of your thought, and to enter  
the Christ Mind you have but to think along Jesus Christ  
lines.  
Every man produces a thought atmosphere that has character  
and power in proportion to his ability as a thinker. Power  
increases with expansion; in thought, power is great or  
small as the ideals are high or low. When you follow narrow  
ideals your thought atmosphere is correspondingly  
contracted; but mental breadth enlarges and strengthens it  
in all directions.  
"How can a man conceal himself?" said Confucius. In the  
light of the ever-present thought atmosphere with which we  
surround ourselves, he cannot. Nearly all people have the  
ability of sensing the thought atmosphere of those they  
meet; and a man may cultivate this ability to project  
himself until he becomes an open book and the air about him  
is filled with his silent yet potent words, ever telling  
what he has thought.  
The thought atmosphere is a real, substantial thing, and  
has in it all that makes the body. We have a way of  
considering the things we cannot see as unsubstantial, and  
although we are told that we cannot conceal ourselves we go  
right on believing that we can. Hence it is good for us to  
know that of a truth we do carry about with us this open  
book  

<span id="page_31">p. 31</span>

of our life, out of which all persons read whether we  
realize it or not. Some people are good thought readers  
while others are dull, but all can read a little, and you  
cannot conceal yourself. Also your thought atmosphere is  
constantly printing its slowly cooling words on your body,  
where they are seen of men. But with a little practice we  
can feet the thought force of this atmosphere that  
surrounds us and gradually gain a realization of its  
existence that is as real as that of the outer world.  
"Think on these things," said Paul. Think about Christ as a  
life force penetrating your whole being. Try to feel this  
force as an energy pulsating through every nerve and fiber  
of your body. Then imagine you can see this life force as a  
light lighting up every cell. Light represents  
intelligence, and when the light in you breaks forth into  
understanding you will know that there is a spiritual mind  
that is as much greater than the ordinary mind as the sun  
is greater than the moon. In Him is life, and this life is  
the light of men.  

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">18 The Jews therefore answered and said unto him,
What sign  
showest thou to us, seeing that thou doest these things? 19  
Jesus answered and said unto them, Destroy this temple, and  
in three days I will raise it up. 20 The Jews therefore  
said, Forty and six years was this temple in building, and  
wilt thou raise it up in three days? 21 But he spake of the  
temple of his body. 22 When therefore he was raised from  
the dead, his disciples remembered that he spake this; and  
they believed the scripture, and the word which Jesus had  
said.  
</span>

</div>

That the temple referred to means the body is

<span id="page_32">p. 32</span>

clearly stated in verse 21: "But he spake of the temple of his body."
Man's ability to preserve his body from destruction is the proof that he
has mastered his mind. So long as our body shows signs of decay it is
evident that we have not cast out of the inner realms the "thought
butchers" that for a sacrifice kill doves, sheep, oxen, and goats. The
allusion here is to the destructive thoughts lying deep in the
consciousness at the very issues of life.

The "three days" are spirit, soul, and body, the three "degrees" or
parts of man's consciousness. When the I AM of man has purified and
mastered these three, man is in the dominion proclaimed for him in the
1st chapter of Genesis; the Scripture or Word of God is fulfilled in
him, and his faculties (disciples) recognize and respond to it every
time that the uplifting word (the resurrecting word) is proclaimed.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">23 Now when he was in Jerusalem at the passover,
during the  
feast, many believed on his name, beholding his signs which  
he did. 24 But Jesus did not trust himself unto them, for  
that he knew all men, 25 and because he needed not that any  
one should bear witness concerning man; for he himself knew  
what was in man.  
</span>

</div>

Truth is of the absolute order and does not have to be proved. Jesus
recognized this fact and therefore did not feel it necessary to place
any great value on the opinion of those who had not yet fully attained
spiritual consciousness.
