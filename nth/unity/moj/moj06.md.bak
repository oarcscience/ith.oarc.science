###  John: Chapter 4 

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">When therefore the Lord knew that the Pharisees had
heard  
that Jesus was making and baptizing more disciples than  
John 2 (although Jesus himself baptized not, but his  
disciples), 3 he left Judaea, and departed again into  
Galilee. 4 And he must needs pass through Samaria. 5 So he  
cometh to a city of Samaria, called Sychar, near to the  
parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph: 6 and  
Jacob's well was there. Jesus therefore, being wearied with  
his journey, sat thus by the well. It was about the sixth  
hour.  
</span>

</div>

THE NAME Samaria means "watchtower"; and Samaria represents that
department of the objective consciousness which functions through the
head. The name Sychar means "drunken," and the place symbolizes a
confused state of mind. Sychar was located near the parcel of ground
that Jacob gave to his son Joseph; physiologically it corresponds to the
forehead, seat of intellectual perception. Here also is Jacob's
well--inspiration through the intellect alone.

Jesus--I AM--has been compassing the whole man, from within to without,
and the I AM "rests" at the point where the intellectual and the
spiritual meet.

<span class="small">7 There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water:
Jesus  
saith unto her, Give me to drink. 8 For his disciples were  
gone away into the city to buy food. 9 The Samaritan woman  
therefore saith unto him, How is that thou, being a Jew,  
asketh drink of me, who am a Samaritan woman? (For Jews  
have no dealings with Samaritans.) 10 Jesus answered and  
said unto her, If thou knewest the gift of God, and  
</span>

<span id="page_45">p. 45</span>

who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou  
wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee  
living water. 11 The woman saith unto him, Sir, thou hast  
nothing to draw with, and the well is deep: whence then  
hast thou that living water? 12 Art thou greater than our  
Father Jacob, who gave us the well, and drank thereof  
himself, and his sons, and his cattle? 13 Jesus answered  
and said unto her, Every one that drinketh of this water  
shall thirst again: 14 but whosoever drinketh of the water  
that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water  
that I shall give him shall become in him a well of water  
springing up unto eternal life. 15 The woman saith unto  
him, Sir, give me this water, that I thirst not, neither  
come all the way hither to draw. 16 Jesus saith unto her,  
Go, call thy husband, and come hither. 17 The woman  
answered and said unto him, I have no husband. Jesus saith  
unto her, Thou saidst well, I have no husband: 18 for thou  
hast had five husbands; and he whom thou now hast is not  
thy husband: this hast thou said truly. 19 The woman saith  
unto him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet. 20 Our  
fathers worshipped in this mountain; and ye say, that in  
Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship. 21 Jesus  
saith unto her, Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when  
neither in this mountain, nor in Jerusalem, shall ye  
worship the Father. 22 Ye worship that which ye know not:  
we worship that which we know; for salvation is from the  
Jews. 23 But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true  
worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and truth:  
for such doth the Father seek to be his worshippers. 24 God  
is Spirit: and they that worship him must worship in spirit  
and truth. 25 The woman saith unto him, I know that Messiah  
cometh (he that is called Christ): when he is come, he will  
declare unto us all things. 26 Jesus saith unto her, I that  
speak unto thee am he.  

<span id="page_46">p. 46</span>

27 And upon this came his disciples; and they marvelled  
that he was speaking with a woman; yet no man said, What  
seekest thou? or, Why speakest thou with her? 28 So the  
woman left her waterpot, and went away into the city, and  
saith to the people, 29 Come, see a man, who told me all  
things that ever I did: can this be the Christ? 30 They  
went out of the city, and were coming to him.  

</div>

Jesus preached one of His greatest sermons to the woman at the well; she
was a Samaritan, a heathen. ("Jews have no dealings with Samaritans.")
Her highest concept of God was that of a being who had to be worshiped
in some temple in Jerusalem or in a certain mountain. Jesus told her,
"God is Spirit: and they that worship him must worship in spirit and
truth."

To worship God truly we must know where He is and how to approach Him.
If, as many teach, God lives in heaven, and heaven is located somewhere
in the skies, we have a consciousness of separation from Him, and our
approach to Him is uncertain.

But when we know the truth about God, that He is an omnipresent Spirit
manifesting Himself to our mind when we think of Him as one with us in
Spirit and responding to our every thought, then we know Him as He is.

This lesson on omnipresence needs constant repeating because we function
mentally and physically, the material or manifest predominating. Here we
are told that Jesus went from Judea to Galilee. Judea connotes Spirit
and Galilee connotes manifestation. Jesus told the woman that salvation
came from the

<span id="page_47">p. 47</span>

Judeans or spiritual-minded. It is easy to understand God as Spirit and
man as His spiritual offspring.

The "well of water springing up into eternal life" is the fount of
Christ inspiration within man's consciousness. When the seal of material
thought is broken this inner spiritual life flows forth peacefully,
majestically, vitalizing and renewing mind and body. In the clear light
of Truth we are conscious of life as unchanging, eternal.

The Samaritan woman represents the duality of the soul or
subconsciousness. It is not the true source of wisdom, although many
searchers after Truth fail to distinguish between its revelations and
those of Spirit. In Hindu metaphysics it is known as the human and
animal soul.

The Samaritans claimed to be descendants of Jacob, and they used
portions of the Hebrew Scriptures, but in the eyes of the Israelites the
Samaritans were pretenders, not true followers of Jehovah. Thus
spiritually enlightened people see in psychic and spiritistic phenomena
and the revelations of that branch of occultism an imitation of Truth,
without a true understanding of its relation to Spirit.

But the soul must have Truth, and Christ recognizes the soul as worthy;
hence this wonderful lesson of John 4:9-26 given to one auditor. The
soul draws its life from both the earthly side of existence (Jacob's
well) and the spiritual (the Jew), but is destined to draw from a higher
fount, omnipotent Spirit. Jesus asked the woman for a drink, which
indicates the universality of the spiritual life, present

<span id="page_48">p. 48</span>

in the Samaritan woman as well as in Jesus.

"The gift of God" to man is eternal life. The soul informed of this
truth asks the Father for the manifestation of this life, and there
gushes forth a never-failing stream. But where sense consciousness is
dominant the soul is slow to see the realities of ideas, thoughts, and
words; the sight is fixed on material ways and means: "Thou hast nothing
to draw with ... whence then hast thou that living water?" This is a
fair setting forth of the status of the questioning ones of this day who
ask the explanation of spiritual things on a material basis.

The Christ is a discerner of thoughts and reads the history of the soul
as an open book. When Jesus displayed this ability to the woman, she at
once had faith in Him and accepted Him as a prophet, not because she
understood His doctrine, but because He had told her of her past: "Come,
see a man, who told me all things that ever I did."

In its natural state the soul is attached to localities, forms, and
conditions in the world. It believes in the importance of places of
worship and in the observance of outward forms. The Mind of Spirit puts
all such formalities aside and proclaims the universality of spiritual
forces. "God is Spirit." "Neither in this mountain, nor in Jerusalem,
shall ye worship the Father." The soul, by falling into forms of
worship, fails to get the true understanding, but the Christ-minded know
Spirit. They enter into the consciousness of the formless life and
substance and they are satisfied.

The Jews represent spiritual understanding, inspiration;

<span id="page_49">p. 49</span>

the Gentiles represent material understanding. Salvation comes only
through spiritual inspiration. This is the inner interpretation of
Jesus' words "Salvation is from the Jews."

The "woman of Samaria" is a combination of the intellectual and
emotional side of the soul. Jesus met her beside Jacob's well
(inspiration through the intellect alone) in the city of Sychar (a
confused state of mind). The I AM (Jesus) has power to harmonize the
intellect by the power of Spirit. But before the I AM can do this, it
must get the intelligent attention of the mixed state of consciousness
symbolized by Sychar and the Samaritans. Being a combination of both
Hebrew and heathen blood, the Samaritans were a mixed race; the woman at
the well recognized the separation that exists between absolute Truth
and the mixed thoughts of intellect. Jesus is not afraid of being
contaminated by such communion. He is willing to imbibe the inspiration
of this realm of mind, and in so doing He comes in touch with its
interests.

The Jesus consciousness is appealing to intellectual people to recognize
the gift of God, the Spirit of universal love and brotherhood. It
invites their thoughts to receive the living inspiration, which may be
had for the asking. But man must ask. "Ask, and ye shall receive."

The questioning, analytical attitude taken by the woman at the well
represents the tendency of intellect to argue: "I see no visible means
whereby you can get the everlasting water of life. Are you greater than
all the precedents and antecedents of intellectual inheritance and
experience?" These assumptions

<span id="page_50">p. 50</span>

of the spiritual-minded that they have a truth higher than human reason
seem to be farfetched and ephemeral. These are but a few of the many
questions and objections of the intellectually wise.

Nevertheless spiritual perception continues to affirm that it has the
inspiration that will never slacken or prove wanting. The mortal
understands so little that it is constantly asking for more. It is never
satisfied with itself or with the knowledge that it finds; but whoever
drinks of the true spiritual inspiration will never thirst. It will
prove a "well of water springing up unto eternal life."

The outer symbol of worship is adoration, homage; but worship in Spirit
and Truth involves absolute union with the character of the object of
worship. Therefore in order to fulfill the requirements of spiritual
worship, a right understanding of God and a development in oneself of
His Spirit are necessary.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">31 In the mean while the disciples prayed him,
saying,  
Rabbi, eat. 32 But he said unto them, I have meat to eat  
that ye know not. 33 The disciples therefore said one to  
another, Hath any man brought him aught to eat? 34 Jesus  
saith unto them, My meat is to do the will of him that sent  
me, and to accomplish this work. 34 Say not ye, There are  
yet four months, and then cometh the harvest? behold, I say  
unto you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields, that  
they are white already unto harvest, 36 He that reapeth  
receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto life eternal;  
that he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice  
together. 37 For herein is the saying true, One soweth, and  
another reapeth. 38 I sent you to reap that whereon ye have  
not labored: others have labored, and ye are entered into  
their labor.  
</span>

</div>

<span id="page_51">p. 51</span>

On the divine side of his being man makes contact with spiritual ideas,
which are the source of external substance or food. The natural man
(represented by the disciples) thinks that the substance necessary for
food must be put through the material process of planting and
harvesting, but in Spirit the pure substance is always at hand ready to
be appropriated by the inner consciousness. In states of high spiritual
realization the desire for material food vanishes. Jesus fasted for
forty days and "afterward hungered."

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">39 And from that city many of the Samaritans
believed on  
him because of the word of the woman, who testified, He  
told me all things that ever I did. 40 So when the  
Samaritans came unto him, they besought him to abide with  
them: and he abode there two days. 41 And many more  
believed because of his word; 42 and they said to the  
woman, Now we believe, not because of thy speaking: for we  
have heard for ourselves, and know that this is indeed the  
Saviour of the world.  
</span>

There are always those at hand who need help, and that is our chance to
administer aid. The woman who received help from Jesus at the well fled
to the city to tell the people of Him. The result was that many came to
Him, and He ministered to them all, proving that salvation is for all
alike. "God is no respecter of persons." Salvation comes to everyone who
assimilates and appropriates these truths and lets them find expression
in and through him. Jesus healed and freed those to whom He ministered,
and they believed, not because of what the woman said

<span id="page_52">p. 52</span>

but because they themselves witnessed what Jesus Himself did.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">43 And after the two days he went forth from thence
into  
Galilee. 44 For Jesus himself testified, that a prophet  
hath no honor in his own country. 45 So when he came into  
Galilee, the Galilaeans received him, having seen all  
things that he did in Jerusalem at the feast: for they also  
went unto the feast.  
</span>

</div>

Jesus came into Galilee, and the Galileans received Him. Spiritually
interpreted, this means that the indwelling Christ reaches spiritual
consummation, spiritual unity with the original Spirit, in the measure
that it manifests life and functions in Spirit consciousness. Life
activity (Galilee) is omnipresent, and man needs to apprehend the laws
of Spirit, the laws governing all manifest things and his relation to
all things.

The natural man looks up to what he considers mysterious and wonderful.
He is not impressed by anything he thinks he knows and understands.
Miracles to him are expected to come forth from some miraculous
background. Therefore, Jesus, the carpenter's son, was of too common
origin for His native companions to have any great faith in His claims
of spiritual inspiration. "No man is a hero to his tailor." Therefore
the Master "did not many mighty works there \[in Nazareth\] because of
their unbelief."

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">46 He came therefore again unto Cana of Galilee,
where he  
made the water wine. And there was  
</span>

<span id="page_53">p. 53</span>

a certain nobleman, whose son was sick at Capernaum. 47  
When he heard that Jesus was come out of Judaea into  
Galilee, he went unto him, and besought him that he would  
come down, and heal his son; for he was at the point of  
death. 48 Jesus therefore said unto him, Except ye see  
signs and wonders, ye will in no wise believe. 49 The  
nobleman saith unto him, Sir, come down ere my child die.  
50 So Jesus saith unto him, Go thy way; thy son liveth. The  
man believed the word that Jesus spake unto him, and he  
went his way. 51 And as he was now going down, his servants  
met him, saying, that his son lived. 52 So he inquired of  
them the hour when he began to amend. They said therefore  
unto him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.  
53 So the father knew that it was at that hour in which  
Jesus said unto him, Thy son liveth: and himself believed,  
and his whole house. 54 This is again the second sign that  
Jesus did, having come out of Judaea into Galilee.  

</div>

It is believed by many professing Christians that the healing of the
nobleman's son was a miracle performed only to furnish proof that Jesus
came from God. A Bible commentator who is counted very wise in Bible
interpretation has said: "Miracles have been wrought only to
authenticate the bearers of supernatural revelation, so when a
revelation is really being given, the dull minds of men should be
compelled to discern, and attend to it by works so evidently due to
divine power as to demonstrate that the speaker must bring a message
directly from God." Yet Jesus Himself taught that those who believed on
Him should do the works that He did and greater works.

<span id="page_54">p. 54</span>

The fact is that the healing of the nobleman's son is being duplicated
every day of the year by modern followers of Jesus' methods, followers
who have numberless absent patients, whom they never see yet whom they
heal as effectually as Jesus healed the nobleman's son. Unity has
similar cases every day, and the testimonials that we receive bear
witness to the efficacy of our healing ministry. The light of Truth is
shining more brightly today than ever before. The same faith that healed
the nobleman's son will heal all persons who open their minds to it and
let go of prejudice and unbelief. This fact is being demonstrated to all
who are willing to believe.

Faith on the part of the patient or of someone connected with him is
found to be an important factor in absent healing. This nobleman had
faith that Jesus could heal his son, and when Jesus uttered the positive
truth "Go thy way; thy son liveth," he "believed the word."

Spiritual healing is so marvelous and so far beyond the range of human
explanation that it may appear to be supernatural. We cannot explain it
clearly, but this we know: When we attain oneness with the invisible
force that moves the mind, a new and higher energy sweeps through us;
the thought is ablaze, and even our spoken words seem alive. When the
word or spiritualized thought is sent to a receptive mind, it is
conducted like the oscillations of the wireless telegraph; there is a
universal thought ether that carries the message.

When the word goes forth from a spiritual center

<span id="page_55">p. 55</span>

(represented by Jesus and His apostles) it becomes a continuous
life-giver to all who believe in the spiritual as the source of life.
Through faith they "tune in" and catch the message from the living word.
"The words that I have spoken unto you are spirit, and are life."
"Heaven and earth shall pass away: but my words shall not pass away."
