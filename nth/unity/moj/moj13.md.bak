###  John: Chapter 11 

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Now a certain man was sick, Lazarus of Bethany, of
the  
village of Mary and her sister Martha. 2 And it was that  
Mary who anointed the Lord with ointment, and wiped his  
feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick. 3 The  
sisters therefore sent unto him, saying, Lord, behold, he  
whom thou lovest is sick. 4 But when Jesus heard it, he  
said, This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of  
God, that the Son of God may be glorified thereby. 5 Now  
Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus. 6 When  
therefore he heard that he was sick, he abode at that time  
two days in the place where he was. 7 Then after this he  
saith to the disciples, Let us go into Judaea again. 8 The  
disciples say unto him, Rabbi, the Jews were but now  
seeking to stone thee; and goest thou thither again? 9  
Jesus answered, Are there not twelve hours in the day? If a  
man walk in the day, he stumbleth not, because he seeth the  
light of this world. 10 But if a man walk in the night, he  
stumbleth, because the light is not in him. 11 These things  
spake he: and after this he saith unto them, Our friend  
Lazarus is fallen asleep; but I go, that I may awake him  
out of sleep. 12 The disciples therefore said unto him,  
Lord, if he is fallen asleep, he will recover. 13 Now Jesus  
had spoken of his death: but they thought that he spake of  
taking rest in sleep. 14 Then Jesus therefore said unto  
them plainly, Lazarus is dead. 15 And I am glad for your  
sakes that I was not there, to the intent ye may believe;  
nevertheless let us go unto him. 16 Thomas therefore, who  
is called Didymus, said unto his fellow-disciples, Let us  
also go, that we may die with him.

THE NAME Lazarus means "whom God helps." Metaphysically interpreted,
Lazarus represents the spiritual strength that comes to man

<span id="page_107">p. 107</span>

through his recognition of God as his supporting, sustaining power. When
man fails to recognize God as the origin and support of his life,
spiritual understanding becomes weak in him and he sinks into
materiality. To all intents he is dead to the Truth of his own being.
The devotional soul, Mary, and the practical soul, Martha, are sisters
in this intellect, and although like all women they have faith in the
Spirit, they allow themselves to fall under the thought of mortal law
and believe in the reality of death. The whole world is under the
hypnotism of this material belief, and it is making tombs for thousands
every day.

Out of a torpid condition of soul like that of Lazarus the I AM (Jesus)
calls forth the living Spirit of the Christ, and reawakens by one word
the consciousness of true understanding in man and the quickened
perception of his faculties.

The name Thomas means "twin." Spiritually considered, Thomas is
understanding, whose twin is Matthew, the will. Matthew, metaphysical
twin of Thomas, is not so described in the Scriptures; spiritually he is
identified as the co-ordinating faculty. In a well-balanced mind
understanding is followed by action.

Intellectual understanding assures us of the truth of our sense
impressions. It says, "Seeing is believing." According to this dictum,
if we should see written on a blackboard, "Two plus two equals six," we
should be called on to accept as true a contradiction of the principles
of mathematics.

<span class="small">17 So when Jesus came, he found that he \[Lazarus\]
had been  
in the tomb four days already. 18 Now Bethany was nigh unto  
Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs off; 19 and many of the  
Jews had come to Martha and Mary, to console them  
concerning their brother. 20 Martha therefore, when she  
heard that Jesus was coming, went and met him: but Mary  
still sat in the house. 21 Martha therefore said unto  
Jesus, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not  
died. 22 And even now I know that, whatsoever thou shalt  
ask of God, God will give thee. 23 Jesus saith unto her,  
Thy brother shall rise again. 24 Martha saith unto him, I  
know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the  
last day. 25 Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection,  
and the life: he that believeth on me, though he die, yet  
shall he live; 26 and whosoever liveth and believeth on me  
shall never die. Believest thou this? 27 She saith unto  
him, Yea, Lord; I have believed that thou art the Christ,  
the Son of God, even he that cometh into the world. 28 And  
when she had said this, she went away, and called Mary her  
sister secretly, saying, The Teacher is here, and calleth  
thee. 29 And she, when she heard it, arose quickly, and  
went unto him. 30 (Now Jesus was not yet come into the  
village, but was still in the place where Martha met him.)  
31 The Jews then who were with her in the house, and were  
consoling her, when they saw Mary, that she rose up quickly  
and went out, followed her, supposing that she was going  
unto the tomb to weep there. 32 Mary therefore, when she  
came where Jesus was, and saw him, fell down at his feet,  
saying unto him, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother  
had not died. 33 When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and  
the Jews also weeping who came with her, he groaned in the  
spirit, and was troubled, 34 and said, Where have ye laid  
him? They say unto him, Lord,  
</span>

<span id="page_109">p. 109</span>

come and see. 35 Jesus wept. 36 The Jews therefore said,  
Behold how he loved him! 37 But some of them said, Could  
not this man, who opened the eyes of him that was blind,  
have caused that this man also should not die? 38 Jesus  
therefore again groaning in himself cometh to the tomb. Now  
it was a cave, and a stone lay against it. 39 Jesus saith,  
Take ye away the stone. Martha, the sister of him that was  
dead, saith unto him, Lord, by this time the body decayeth;  
for he hath been dead four days. 40 Jesus saith unto her,  
Said I not unto thee, that, if thou believedst, thou  
shouldest see the glory of God? 41 So they took away the  
stone. And Jesus lifted up his eyes, and said, Father, I  
thank thee that thou heardest me. 42 And I knew that thou  
hearest me always: but because of the multitude that  
standeth around I said it, that they may believe that thou  
didst send me. 43 And when he had thus spoken, he cried  
with a loud voice, Lazarus, come forth. 44 He that was dead  
came forth, bound hand and foot with grave-clothes; and his  
face was bound about with a napkin. Jesus saith unto them,  
Loose him, and let him go.

Jesus represents man in the regeneration; that is, man in the process of
restoring his body to its natural condition, where it will live right on
perpetually without old age, disease, or death. A necessary step in this
process of body restoration is the quickening of the sleeping Lazarus,
who represents the vitalizing energies in the subconsciousness that feed
the body and give it the life force that renews its youth.

Jesus was at Bethany near Jerusalem. Metaphysically Jerusalem represents
a point in consciousness where the spiritual energy of life is strong
enough to vitalize adjacent body substance (Bethany, "house

<span id="page_110">p. 110</span>

of figs"). Jesus vitalized and baptized His soul and body with spirit
life when He denied the power of death over Lazarus and affirmed the
resurrecting life. We can do the same thing when we do it in His name.
Jesus' groaning and weeping represent the seemingly insurmountable
conditions that are just before us.

We should ever remember that the youth we love so well never dies; it is
merely asleep in the subconscious--Jesus said that Lazarus was not dead.
People grow old because they let the youth idea fall asleep. This idea
is not dead but is sleeping, and the understanding I AM (Jesus) goes to
awaken it. This awakening of youthful energies is necessary to one in
the regeneration. The body cannot be refined and made, like its Creator,
eternal before all the thoughts necessary to its perpetuation are
revived in it. Eternal youth is one of these God-given ideas that man
loves. Jesus loved Lazarus.

The outer senses say that this vitalizing force of youth is dead in man,
that it has been dead for so long that it has gone into dissolution,
decay; but the keener knowledge of the spiritual man proclaims, "Our
friend Lazarus is fallen asleep; but I . . . awake him out of sleep."

Bringing this sleeping life to outer consciousness is no easy task.
Jesus groaned in spirit and was troubled at the prospect. The higher
must enter into sympathy and love with the lower to bring about the
awakening--"Jesus wept." But there must be more than sympathy and
love--"Take ye away the stone." The "stone" that holds the sleeping life
in the

<span id="page_111">p. 111</span>

tomb of matter in subconsciousness is the belief in the permanency of
present material laws. This "stone" must be rolled away through faith.
The man who wants the inner life to spring forth must believe in the
reality of omnipresent spiritual life and must exercise his faith by
invoking in prayer the presence of the invisible but omnipresent God.
This reveals to consciousness the glory of Spirit, and the soul has
witness in itself of a power that it knew not.

In Spirit all things are fulfilled now. The moment a concept enters the
mind, the thing conceived is consummated through the law that governs
the action of ideas. The inventor mentally sees his machine doing the
work designed, though he may be years short of making it do that work.
The spiritual-minded take advantage of this law and affirm the
completeness of this ideal, regardless of outer appearances. This
stimulates the energy in the thought process and gives it power beyond
estimate. This is the step that Jesus took when He lifted up His eyes
and said: "Father, I thank thee that thou heardest me. And I knew that
thou hearest me always." The sleeping youth (Lazarus) does not at once
respond, but the prayer of thanksgiving that is now in action gives the
assurance that calls it at the next step to the surface--"Lazarus, come
forth."

Jesus "cried with a loud voice." This emphasizes the necessity of
working strenuously to project the inner life to the surface. Beginners
find it easy, under proper instruction, to quicken the various life
centers in the body and co-ordinate them as a body

<span id="page_112">p. 112</span>

battery that, under the direction of the will, throws a current of
energy to any desired place. A time comes when the outer flesh must be
vitalized with this inner life; then arises the necessity of using the
"loud voice" as the propelling force. This is removing from the face the
"napkin," which represents conscious intelligence made manifest.

Freedom from all trammels is necessary before the imprisoned life can
find its natural channel in the constitution. "Loose him, and let him
go" means unfettered life expressing itself in joyous freedom of Spirit.
The flesh would take this vital flood and use it in the old way, put new
wine into old bottles, but Spirit guides those who trust it, and leads
them in righteous ways when they listen patiently to the inner guide.

This raising of Lazarus is performed every day by those who are putting
on the new Christ body through the resurrected Christ life.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">45 Many therefore of the Jews, who came to Mary and
beheld  
that which he did, believed on him. 46 But some of them  
went away to the Pharisees, and told them the things which  
Jesus had done.  
</span>

</div>

Interpreted within ourselves, there are always the thought forces that
believe the Truth and accept the so-called miracles of the Christ, but
there are also those that question and resort to the Pharisees (the
strict intellectual phase of mind) for their stamp of approval.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">47 The chief priests therefore and the Pharisees  
</span>

<span id="page_113">p. 113</span>

gathered a council, and said, What do we? for this man  
doeth many signs. 48 If we let him thus alone, all men will  
believe on him: and the Romans will come and take away both  
our place and our nation. 49 But a certain one of them,  
Caiaphas, being high priest that year, said unto them, Ye  
know nothing at all, 50 nor do ye take account that it is  
expedient for you that one man should die for the people,  
and that the whole nation perish not. 51 Now this he said  
not of himself: but being high priest that year, he  
prophesied that Jesus should die for the nation; 52 and not  
for the nation only, but that he might also gather together  
into one the children of God that are scattered abroad. 53  
So from that day forth they took counsel that they might  
put him to death.  

</div>

In this instance the Pharisees represent a congregation of intellectual
thought people called together to counsel with one another. The Romans
symbolize the rule of the natural man. The intellectual Pharisee is
always jealous of his religious rights and fearful of being robbed of
his own. He observes the forms of religion but neglects the spirit. He
does not understand the activities of the Christ Mind and therefore
fears it.

Another tendency of the intellect is to question and argue back and
forth. The high priest symbolizes the highest spiritual thought force in
authority that has an inkling of Truth, and he perceives that the Christ
will eventually give His life for the redemption of all. The narrow
intellect, however, does not have the spiritual viewpoint and seeks to
destroy the saving spiritual power.

<span id="page_114">p. 114</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">54 Jesus therefore walked no more openly among the
Jews,  
but departed thence into the country near to the  
wilderness, into a city called Ephraim; and there he  
tarried with the disciples. 55 Now the passover of the Jews  
was at hand: and many went up to Jerusalem out of the  
country before the passover, to purify themselves. 56 They  
sought therefore for Jesus, and spake one with another, as  
they stood in the temple, What think ye? That he will not  
come to the feast? 57 Now the chief priests and the  
Pharisees had given commandment, that, if any man knew  
where he was, he should show it, that they might take him.  
</span>

</div>

When a state of consciousness is not open to Truth, the Christ (in this
Scripture symbolized by Jesus) withdraws to an inner sanctum (here
symbolized by Ephraim, a name that means "doubly fruitful"), where
closer union with the great divine source is found. Jesus therefore
walked no more openly among the Jews.

The Feast of the Passover represents a passing from a lower state of
consciousness to a higher. For the spiritual passover the devout always
seek the city of peace (Jerusalem). No matter in what state of
consciousness one may be functioning there is always that within which
craves something better. The intellect, continuing to believe it is to
be the highest authority, would kill out the Christ.
