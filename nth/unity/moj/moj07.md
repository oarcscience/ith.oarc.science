###  John: Chapter 5 

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">After these things there was a feast of the Jews;
and Jesus  
went up to Jerusalem.  
</span>

</div>

JERUSALEM IS the spiritual center in consciousness. A feast in Jerusalem
is a receptive state of mind toward all spiritual good, and the
appropriation of that good for future use. Jerusalem means "city of
peace." When we get deep down into the silent recesses of our soul we
realize a stillness and sweetness beyond expression. There is a great
peace there, the "peace of God, which passeth all understanding," and a
welling up of an indescribable substance that fills the whole
consciousness at the point where the inflow of original substance takes
place.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">2 Now there is in Jerusalem by the sheep gate a
pool, which  
is called in Hebrew Bethesda, having five porches. 3 In  
these lay a multitude of them that were sick, blind, halt,  
withered, (waiting for the moving of the water. 4 for an  
angel of the Lord went down at certain seasons into the  
pool, and troubled the water whosoever then first after the  
troubling of the water stepped in was made whole, with  
whatsoever disease he was holden--margin.) 5 And a certain  
man was there, who had been thirty and eight years in his  
infirmity. 6 When Jesus saw him lying, and knew that he had  
been now a long time in that case, he saith unto him,  
Wouldest thou be made whole? 7 The sick man answered him,  
Sir, I have no man, when the water is troubled, to put me  
into the pool: but while I am coming, another steppeth down  
before me. 8 Jesus saith unto him, Arise, take up thy bed,  
and walk. 9 And straightway the man was made whole, and  
took up his bed and walked.  
</span>

</div>

<span id="page_57">p. 57</span>

Sheep are the most harmless and innocent of all animals, and they
represent the natural life that flows into man's consciousness from
Spirit. It is pure, innocent, guileless; and when we open our mind to
this realization of Spirit life we open the gate by the sheep market.

Here is a pool called Bethesda (meaning "house of mercy" or "place of
receiving and caring for the sick"). There are also five porches or
covered colonnades. This "pool" represents the realization in
consciousness that our life is being constantly purified, healed, and
made new by the activity of mind. Physically this is expressed in the
purification and upbuilding of the blood by coming in contact with the
oxygen of the air in the lungs. The ebb and flow of the waters of the
pool is constant, and when our mind is active all the depleted blood
corpuscles are purified and renewed.

This great multitude of "sick folk" (depleted life corpuscles) lies near
this pool, under the "five porches" (five senses). The "five-sense"
consciousness does not realize the power of the I AM to quicken these
inner functions of man's organism; it lets weak, depleted life cells
accumulate and burden its system, when a thought of the activity of life
would, through the divine law, set them free from their helplessness.

It is not necessary that all the purification and renewing of the
depleted corpuscles take place through the lungs when man understands
the power of the I AM to declare the word of activity. Jesus, the I AM
of Spirit, did not tell the man to go down

<span id="page_58">p. 58</span>

into the pool and be healed, but said, "Arise, take up thy bed, and
walk." Thus we see that the work of the Spirit is not confined to
physical activities, although it does not ignore them. If your lung
capacity is not equal to the purification of your blood, increase it by
declaring the law of active life. Anemic blood may be made vigorous and
virile by daily centering the attention in the lungs and affirming them
to be spiritual, and under the perpetual inflow of new life and the
outflow of old life the lungs will do your will.

Do not be limited by so-called established laws of nature, or by man's
mortal thought that if you have reached the age of "thirty-eight" the
life current is beginning to wane, that your "sabbath" or day of rest is
setting in. It is "lawful" in Spirit to declare the perpetual activity
of life anywhere, at any time, and under all circumstances. Divine life
takes no cognizance of the laws that the intellect has set up for
governing it. Life is ever active. It is constantly present in all its
fullness and power, and it has no day of rest or "sabbath."

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Now it was the sabbath on that day. 10 So the Jews
said  
unto him that was cured, It is the sabbath, and it is not  
lawful for thee to take up thy bed. 11 But he answered  
them, He that made me whole, the same said unto me, Take up  
thy bed, and walk. 12 They asked him, Who is the man that  
said unto thee, Take up thy bed, and walk? 13 But he that  
was healed knew not who it was; for Jesus had conveyed  
himself away, a multitude being in the place. 14 Afterward  
Jesus findeth him in the temple, and said unto him, Behold,  
thou art made whole: sin no more, lest a  
</span>

<span id="page_59">p. 59</span>

worse thing befall thee. 15 The man went away, and told the  
Jews that it was Jesus who had made him whole. 16 And for  
this cause the Jews persecuted Jesus, because he did these  
things on the sabbath. 17 But Jesus answered them, My  
Father worketh even until now, and I work. 18 For this  
cause therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him,  
because he not only brake the sabbath, but also called God  
his own Father, making himself equal with God.  

</div>

These particular Jews had no understanding of the real "sabbath," which
is a state of consciousness attained through meditation and the
realization that the law is fulfilled in both thought and act.

The "sabbath of the Lord" has nothing to do with any day of the week.
God did not name days and weeks, nor has He darkened His clear concepts
of Truth by the time element.

Therefore, it is during the period of rest known as the "sabbath" that
the demonstrations come forth, the state of consciousness in which the
man that was sick let go of all false appearances and took up his bed
and walked.

Many times much outer discord is avoided by the Christ's seemingly
withdrawing from the outer until the quibbling intellect has somewhat
spent its fury. ("Jesus had conveyed himself away.") Then the Christ
reappears and reveals to the demonstrating thought added light: "Sin no
more, lest a worse thing befall thee."

God-Mind is the living power back of all nature, causing the flowers to
bud and to bloom and the grass to spring up. Jesus explained the outer
working of this law in a very few words when He said,

<span id="page_60">p. 60</span>

"My Father worketh even until now, and I work."

This divine creative power works continually one day just the same as
any other day. Metaphysically we realize that this great creative force
is God-Mind in action, and that it can not only create but also
re-create. Therefore when Jesus spoke the word for him the sick man
through this redeeming agency was instantly made whole. As all sickness
is the result of sin, he who was healed was admonished to refrain from
again breaking the law lest a worse sickness befall him.

Jesus was introducing into the consciousness of man the new truth that
God is indeed the loving Father of all. But the intellectualists
(represented by the Pharisees) could not receive it.

"He not only brake the sabbath \[from the viewpoint of the Pharisees\],
but also called God his own Father, making himself equal with God."

Here again the Jews thought it blasphemy even to consider spiritualizing
their nature until they knew in deed and in truth that God was their
Father and that all that the Father had was theirs.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">19 Jesus therefore answered and said unto them,
Verily,  
verily, I say unto you, The Son can do nothing of himself,  
but what he seeth the Father doing: for what things soever  
he doeth, these the Son also doeth in like manner. 20 For  
the Father loveth the Son, and showeth him all things that  
himself doeth: and greater works than these will he show  
him, that ye may marvel. 21 For as the Father raiseth the  
dead and giveth them life, even so the Son also giveth life  
to whom he will. 22 For neither doth the Father judge any  
man, but he hath given all judgment unto  
</span>

<span id="page_61">p. 61</span>

the Son; 23 that all may honor the Son, even as they honor  
the Father. He that honoreth not the Son honoreth not the  
Father that sent him. 24 Verily, verily, I say unto you, He  
that heareth my word, and believeth him that sent me, hath  
eternal life, and cometh not into judgment, but hath passed  
out of death into life. 25 Verily, verily, I say unto you,  
The hour cometh, and now is, when the dead shall hear the  
voice of the Son of God; and they that hear shall live. 26  
For as the Father hath life in himself, even so gave he to  
the Son also to have life in himself: 27 and he gave him  
authority to execute judgment, because he is a son of man.  
28 Marvel not at this: for the hour cometh, in which all  
that are in the tombs shall hear his voice, 29 and shall  
come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection  
of life; and they that have done evil, unto the  
resurrection of judgment.  

</div>

The Father is the great source of all light and all understanding, and
the Son is the idea that expresses the light and the wisdom of God.

The Son is the idea of God-Mind, of man in his perfection. Under divine
law man makes manifest what God has in His mind.

The divine idea, the Christ, has been given eternal life and has the
power to impart it to the Adam man. In addition to this He has been
given judgment: He determines how the life shall be made manifest. The
Father of life is a great river in the Garden of Eden, which represents
man's innate capacity ready to obtain expression in all wisdom and
understanding.

We honor the Christ when we recognize it as having the authority of God.
In its life-giving capacity

<span id="page_62">p. 62</span>

it is equal to God and has the power of God. When that is enthroned in
us which possesses spiritual identity we have the realization that we
are speaking the word right from the Father. Jesus in this state of
unfoldment proclaimed: "The words that I say unto you I speak not from
myself: but the Father abiding in me doeth his works."

In this way God is most fully manifest in His "divine idea" or Son, the
Christ in man.

What men need above all else in this day is more wisdom, more
discretion, in the use of the life they have. More life accompanied by
the same old destructive ignorance in using it would but add to their
misery. Thus God does not dictate what shall be man's choice with
respect to this or any other act. If man discovers the law through which
life is made manifest in his consciousness, he may use it blindly and
ignorantly if he so elects. But he must also abide by the results of his
choosing, and this is where man sets up his wail of sorrow: he does not
like to reap his sowing.

Death came into our world through the ignorant use of life, and death
can be put out only by a wise use of life. Death is the result of a
wrong conception of life and its use. In the beginning of man's
experiments with the powers of Being, he had no conception of death. His
consciousness was intact and his unfoldment in wisdom was gradual and
orderly. But his desire to experiment predominated. Sensation was sweet
and enticing; it absorbed so much of his attention that he forgot
wisdom--he "hid" from his Lord, and the result was separation from his

<span id="page_63">p. 63</span>

Eden, the divine harmony of the law of spiritual unfoldment.

In raising the dead there are then two factors to deal with. The thought
of the reality of death and the fear of death have both played
destructive roles in the race consciousness, and they must be taken up
and dissolved. The total unreality of death must be portrayed to the
deluded consciousness. The omnipresence and the omnipotence of life are
beyond dispute, and there can be no question that death is a condition
set up in human consciousness. God is not dead; He does not recognize or
countenance death. Neither does man when freed from its delusion. Jesus
said: "Follow me . . . Leave the dead to bury their own dead."

The first step in demonstrating over death is to get the belief entirely
out of the mind that it is God-ordained or is of force or effect
anywhere in the realm of pure Being.

The next step is to live so harmoniously that the whole consciousness
will be not only resurrected from its belief in death but so vivified
and energized with the idea of undying life that it cannot be dissolved
or separated from its vehicle, the body.

If our thoughts are good they work for good in our life, and if they are
bad they are objects of redemption.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">30 I can of myself do nothing; as I hear, I judge:
and my  
judgment is righteous; because I seek not mine own will,  
but the will of him that sent me. 31 If I bear witness of  
myself, my witness is not true. 32 It is another that  
beareth witness of me; and I know that the witness which he  
witnesseth of me  
</span>

<span id="page_64">p. 64</span>

is true. 33 Ye have sent unto John, and he hath borne  
witness unto the truth. 34 But the witness which I receive  
is not from man: howbeit I say these things, that ye may be  
saved. 35 He was the lamp that burneth and shineth; and ye  
were willing to rejoice for a season in his light. 36 But  
the witness which I have is greater than that of John; for  
the works which the Father hath given me to accomplish, the  
very works that I do, bear witness of me, that the Father  
hath sent me. 37 And the Father that sent me, he hath borne  
witness of me. Ye have neither heard his voice at any time,  
nor seen his form. 38 And ye have not his word abiding in  
you: for whom he sent, him ye believe not. 39 Ye search the  
scriptures, because ye think that in them ye have eternal  
life; and these are they which bear witness of me; 40 and  
ye will not come to me, that ye may have life. 41 I receive  
not glory from men. 42 But I know you, that ye have not the  
love of God in yourselves. 43 I am come in my Father's  
name, and ye receive me not: if another shall come in his  
own name, him ye will receive. 44 How can ye believe, who  
receive glory one of another, and the glory that cometh  
from the only God ye seek not? 45 Think not that I will  
accuse you to the Father: there is one that accuseth you,  
even Moses, on whom ye have set your hope. 46 For if ye  
believed Moses, ye would believe me; for he wrote of me. 47  
But if ye believe not his writings, how shall ye believe my  
words?  

</div>

The Christ is the perfect God idea, which is ever in touch with its
source. The Christ therefore realizes always that it can of itself do
nothing, and places all judgment in the law. The laws of God are
unchangeable. Man neither makes nor creates anything of permanence; he
discerns what God has created and conforms to it in thought and act.

<span id="page_65">p. 65</span>

Judgment, when expressed on the mortal plane of consciousness, often is
the expression of a critical and backbiting disposition. Man's safety
lies in recognizing his need and balancing his judgment faculty with
love. Then there will spring forth a new conquering power, which will
express itself in righteousness and justice without condemnation.

The substitution of the Scriptures for the living Word of God is
undoubtedly one of the reasons why the promise of Jesus to His followers
of the ability to do mighty works has not been fulfilled. The Jews of
Jesus' time had done this very thing: they had substituted the Book of
Moses for the living Word and had so materialized their minds and their
religion that they did not know the Messiah when He came. Jesus accused
them of this, saying: "Ye search the scriptures, because ye think that
in them ye have eternal life; and these are they which bear witness of
me; and ye will not come to me, that ye may have life."

The Scriptures alone are not sufficient to impart spiritual
understanding. The Pharisees were inveterate students of the Hebrew
Scriptures, but Jesus accused them repeatedly of lack of understanding.
The Bible is a sealed book to one whose own spiritual understanding has
not been quickened by the living Word. "The word is very nigh unto thee,
in thy mouth, and in thy heart, that thou mayest do it." Jesus so
identified Himself with the living Word that His words became, like it,
creative. He submerged His personality in God-Mind until He became the
expression of that Mind, the idea clothed in

<span id="page_66">p. 66</span>

flesh. "And the Word became flesh, and dwelt among us." Then instead of
memorizing whole chapters of the Bible let us quicken our mind and our
body with the creative word and thereby escape death. "Verily, verily, I
say unto you, If a man keep my word, he shall never see death."

The Pharisaical mind thinks that salvation lies in the Scripture itself,
when in fact the Scripture simply bears witness of the Saviour. The need
is not to concentrate on the letter of the law but to live the Truth and
let the divine principles find expression through the soul. Thus man
learns to travel the path that leads to light and peace and
satisfaction.

There is no necessity of accusing our brother. The law itself works
everything out in perfect justice. In fact Moses symbolizes this
progressive or "drawing-out" process, which in the individual works from
within upward, and in the universe appears as the upward trend of all
things.

The idea that the Bible is the living Word of God has diverted the
attention of Christians from the one creative Word ever since the
original translators dropped the little word "ye" from the sentence (in
John 5:39) in which Jesus criticized the Jews for their much study of
the Scriptures and thereby made their study a command. Modern
translators have corrected this attempt to make Jesus an indorser of the
printed word, and it is now made clear that overstudy of the letter may
prevent one from making unity with the Word of God manifest, Jesus the
Christ.
