###  John: Chapter 6 

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">After these things Jesus went away to the other side
of the  
sea of Galilee, which is the sea of Tiberias. 2 And a great  
multitude followed him, because they beheld the signs which  
he did on them that were sick. 3 And Jesus went up into the  
mountain, and there he sat with his disciples. 4 Now the  
passover, the feast of the Jews, was at hand. 5 Jesus  
therefore lifting up his eyes, and seeing that a great  
multitude cometh unto him, saith unto Philip, Whence are we  
to buy bread, that these may eat? 6 And this he said to  
prove him: for he himself knew what he would do. 7 Philip  
answered him, Two hundred shillings' worth of bread is not  
sufficient for them, that every one may take a little. 8  
One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, saith  
unto him, 9 There is a lad here, who hath five barley  
loaves, and two fishes: but what are these among so many?  
10 Jesus said, Make the people sit down. Now there was much  
grass in the place. So the men sat down, in number about  
five thousand. 11 Jesus therefore took the loaves; and  
having given thanks, he distributed to them that were set  
down; likewise also of the fishes as much as they would. 12  
And when they were filled, he saith unto his disciples,  
Gather up the broken pieces which remain over, that nothing  
be lost. 13 So they gathered them up, and filled twelve  
baskets with broken pieces from the five barley loaves,  
which remained over unto them that had eaten. 14 When  
therefore the people saw the sign which he did, they said,  
This is of a truth the prophet that cometh into the world.  
</span>

</div>

WE INCREASE our vitality by blessing and giving thanks in spirit. To
bring about this increase efficiently we must understand the anatomy of
the soul and mind centers in the body.

It has been found by experience that a person increases

<span id="page_68">p. 68</span>

his blessings by being grateful for what he has. Gratitude even on the
mental plane is a great magnet, and when gratitude is expressed from the
spiritual standpoint it is powerfully augmented. The custom of saying
grace at the table has its origin in man's attempt to use this power of
increase.

A woman who had been left with a large family and no visible means of
support related in an experience meeting how wonderfully this law had
worked in providing food for her children. In her extremity she had
asked the advice of one who understood the law, and she had been told to
thank God silently for abundant supply on her table, regardless of
appearances. She and her children began doing this, and in a short time
the increase of food was so great at times that it astonished them. Her
grocer's bill was met promptly, and in most marvelous ways the family
was supplied with food. Never after that time did they lack.

In all its work the I AM (Christ) uses the faculties of the mind. The I
AM is Spirit, and it cannot move directly on substance or formed states
of consciousness. It uses the spiritual faculties as its agents. The
name Philip means "power," and Jesus appealed to Philip to know how
these hungry "thoughts" or people were to be fed. Jesus did this to
"prove him." This means that power is still under the limitations of
sense. It looks on the visible supply and judges its capacity from that
viewpoint. Andrew (strength), brother of Peter (faith), has a slight
perception of true supply on the seven-sense

<span id="page_69">p. 69</span>

plane of consciousness (represented as the lad with five loaves and two
fishes). This is a good beginning for the I AM. If you have a
consciousness of the capacity that is involved in the natural man's
sevenfold nature, you have a good foundation on which to build the
twelvefold or spiritual man.

Having quickened your idea of power and strength in universal Spirit,
you "sit down" or center your forces within you and begin to bless and
give thanks. In divine order you make connection with the universal,
vital energy of Being and fill your whole consciousness with vitality.
The surplus energy settles back into the various centers as reserve
force (the twelve baskets that remained over). Thus you learn to live by
"the living bread which came down out of heaven," the very flesh or
substance of eternal life.

Jesus and His disciples were on a mountain when this great increase of
substance took place, which indicates a high state of consciousness. An
eminent British scientist, Sir James Jeans, says that it may be that the
gods that determine our fates are our own minds acting on our brain
cells and through them on the world about us. Here is stated a profound
truth that, accepted and tested, will demonstrate supply to meet every
need. Science says that we live in an invisible ether pregnant with the
essence of all visible things, that this essence is wrapped up in the
atom, and that it awaits an as yet undiscovered law to set it free.
Jesus knew the law and through Him we may know it. In World War II
science used this power in the destructive atom bomb. Jesus used

<span id="page_70">p. 70</span>

it constructively in feeding the five thousand.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">15 Jesus therefore perceiving that they were about
to come  
and take him by force, to make him king, withdrew again  
into the mountain himself alone.  
</span>

</div>

Spirit always has the power and the ability to handle any situation.
Jesus knew His time had not yet come. He had not yet developed the
spiritual power necessary to meet the many demands made on Him. The way
out was to withdraw from public work for a season. Those who are
evolving spiritually know whether or not they are equal to certain
demands made on them, and they withdraw to the within for further
spiritual realization and power.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">16 And when evening came, his disciples went down
unto the  
sea; 17 and they entered into a boat, and were going over  
the sea unto Capernaum. And it was now dark, and Jesus had  
not yet come to them. 18 And the sea was rising by reason  
of a great wind that blew. 19 When therefore they had rowed  
about five and twenty or thirty furlongs, they behold Jesus  
walking on the sea, and drawing nigh unto the boat: and  
they were afraid. 20 But he saith unto them, It is I; be  
not afraid. 21 They were willing therefore to receive him  
into the boat: and straightway the boat was at the land  
whither they were going.  
</span>

</div>

To walk on the sea as Jesus did, without sinking down into the waves,
required established faith in the power of Spirit.

We cannot walk on the waves of life in our

<span id="page_71">p. 71</span>

own personal strength. If we remember to call on the strength of Christ
we are sustained by unlimited power, by the real self.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">22 On the morrow the multitude that stood on the
other side  
of the sea saw that there was no other boat there, save  
one, and that Jesus entered not with his disciples into the  
boat, but that his disciples went away alone 23 (howbeit  
there came boats from Tiberias nigh unto the place where  
they ate the bread after the Lord had given thanks): 24  
when the multitude therefore saw that Jesus was not there,  
neither his disciples, they themselves got into the boats,  
and came to Capernaum, seeking Jesus. 25 And when they  
found him on the other side of the sea, they said unto him,  
Rabbi, when camest thou hither? 26 Jesus answered them and  
said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Ye seek me, not  
because ye saw signs, but because ye ate of the loaves, and  
were filled. 27 Work not for the food which perisheth, but  
for the food which abideth unto eternal life, which the Son  
of man shall give unto you: for him the Father, even God,  
hath sealed. 28 They said therefore unto him, What must we  
do, that we may work the works of God? 29 Jesus answered  
and said unto them, This is the work of God, that ye  
believe on him whom he hath sent. 30 They said therefore  
unto him, What then doest thou for a sign, that we may see,  
and believe thee? what workest thou? 31 Our fathers ate the  
manna in the wilderness; as it is written, He gave them  
bread out of heaven to eat. 32 Jesus therefore said unto  
them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, It was not Moses that  
gave you the bread out of heaven; but my Father giveth you  
the true bread out of heaven. 33 For the bread of God is  
that which cometh down out of heaven, and giveth life unto  
the world. 34 They said therefore unto him, Lord, evermore  
give us this bread. 35 Jesus said  
</span>

<span id="page_72">p. 72</span>

unto them, I am the bread of life: he that cometh to me  
shall not hunger, and he that believeth on me shall never  
thirst. 36 But I said unto you, that have seen me, and yet  
believe not. 37 All that which the Father giveth me shall  
come unto me; and him that cometh to me I will in no wise  
cast out. 38 For I am come down from heaven, not to do mine  
own will, but the will of him that sent me. 39 And this is  
the will of him that sent me, that of all that which he  
hath given me I should lose nothing, but should raise it up  
at the last day. 40 For this is the will of my Father, that  
every one that beholdeth the Son, and believeth on him,  
should have eternal life; and I will raise him up at the  
last day.  
41 The Jews therefore murmured concerning him, because he  
said, I am the bread which came down out of heaven. 42 And  
they said, Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose  
father and mother we know? how doth he now say, I am come  
down out of heaven? 43 Jesus answered and said unto them,  
Murmur not among yourselves. 44 No man can come to me,  
except the Father that sent me draw him: and I will raise  
him up in the last day. 45 It is written in the prophets,  
And they shall all be taught of God. Every one that hath  
heard from the Father, and hath learned, cometh unto me. 46  
Not that any man hath seen the Father, save he that is from  
God, he hath seen the Father. 47 Verily, verily, I say unto  
you, He that believeth hath eternal life. 48 I am the bread  
of life. 49 Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness,  
and they died. 50 This is the bread which cometh down out  
of heaven, that a man may eat thereof, and not die. 51 I am  
the living bread which came down out of heaven: if any man  
eat of this bread, he shall live for ever: yea and the  
bread which I will give is my flesh, for the life of the  
world.  
52 The Jews therefore strove one with another,  

<span id="page_73">p. 73</span>

saying, How can this man give us his flesh to eat? 53 Jesus  
therefore said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you,  
Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man and drink his  
blood, ye have not life in yourselves. 54 He that eateth my  
flesh and drinketh my blood hath eternal life; and I will  
raise him up at the last day. 55 For my flesh is meat  
indeed, and my blood is drink indeed. 56 He that eateth my  
flesh and drinketh my blood abideth in me, and I in him. 57  
As the living Father sent me, and I live because of the  
Father; so he that eateth me, he also shall live because of  
me. 58 This is the bread which came down out of heaven; not  
as the fathers ate, and died; he that eateth this bread  
shall live for ever. 59 These things said he in the  
synagogue, as he taught in Capernaum.  

</div>

Here the multitudes (meaning a multitude of thoughts) are really seeking
comfort and consolation ("they themselves got into the boats and came to
Capernaum, seeking Jesus"). They had entered into that inner conviction
of the abiding compassion and restoring power of God.

In the universal Mind principle, which Jesus called "the Father," there
is a substance that also includes the mother or seed of all visible
substance. It is the only real substance because it is unchangeable,
while the visible substance is in constant transition.

The origin or source of all substance is the idea of substance. It is
purely spiritual and can be apprehended only by the mind. It is never
visible to the eye, nor can it be sensed by man through any of the
bodily faculties. Bible authorities say that the Almighty God in Genesis
should have been translated

<span id="page_74">p. 74</span>

El Shaddai, "the breasted one." Thus God is found to include both the
male and the female principle.

When the mind has centered its attention on this idea of substance long
enough and strongly enough, it generates the consciousness of substance,
and through the powers of the various faculties of the mind in right
relation it can form visible substance. Jesus in this way brought into
visibility the loaves and fishes to feed the five thousand.

But this faculty of dealing with ideas is open to all men and women. It
is not given to privileged persons and withheld from all others.

Jesus knew this, and He also knew that every man must center his
attention on this spiritual substance and bring forth its fruits, just
as He did. But those whose attention has long been centered in things
visible are slow to appreciate this fact.

Jesus fed the multitude in an easy way, and they followed Him over the
sea in boats apparently in order to get more food; at least that is the
motive Jesus attributed to them.

Then He tells them plainly that they must not labor for the food that
perishes but for the food that "abideth unto eternal life."

When they asked how they should do these "works of God" or so-called
miracles, He said, "Believe on him whom he hath sent." One translation
says, "Believe in him." Man is to believe in the spiritual presence of
the living God even as one "sent"; that is, entered into the
consciousness.

All shall attain who believe or have faith in the spiritual source of
life. Whoever comes to this Christ

<span id="page_75">p. 75</span>

realm in the heavens all about us will be moved by its will, which is
the will of the Father. There will be no loss, no failure in this realm,
and whoever enters into the Mind of Spirit will have poured out to him
its life essence and be wholly raised up from material conditions when
arriving at the "last day" (the last degree of understanding).

Moses caused manna to fall from heaven to feed the Children of Israel.
The body of Christ is a spiritual substance that we incorporate into
consciousness through faith out of the heavens of mind. That the food we
eat has a spiritual source is proved by those who fast in spiritual
faith much longer and easier than those who are forced to starve.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">60 Many therefore of his disciples, when they heard
this,  
said, This is a hard saying; who can hear it? 61 But Jesus  
knowing in himself that his disciples murmured at this,  
said unto them, Doth this cause you to stumble? 62 What  
then if ye should behold the Son of man ascending where he  
was before? 63 It is the spirit that giveth life; the flesh  
profiteth nothing: the words that I have spoken unto you  
are spirit, and are life. 64 But there are some of you that  
believe not. For Jesus knew from the beginning who they  
were that believed not, and who it was that should betray  
him. 65 And he said, For this cause have I said unto you,  
that no man can come unto me, except it be given unto him  
of the Father.  
66 Upon this many of his disciples went back, and walked no  
more with him. 67 Jesus said therefore unto the twelve,  
Would ye also go away? 68 Simon Peter answered him, Lord,  
to whom shall we go? thou hast the words of eternal life.  
69 And we have believed and know that thou art the Holy One  
of God. 70 Jesus answered them, Did not I  
</span>

<span id="page_76">p. 76</span>

choose you the twelve, and one of you is a devil? 71 Now he  
spake of Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot, for he it was  
that should betray him, being one of the twelve.  

</div>

Jesus said, "It is the spirit that giveth life; the flesh profiteth
nothing: the words that I have spoken unto you are spirit, and are
life." Being, the original fount, is an impersonal principle; but in its
work of creation it puts forth an idea that contains all ideas: the
Logos, Word, Christ, the Son of God, or spiritual man. This spiritual
man or Christ or Word of God is the true inner self of every individual.
Man therefore contains within himself the capacities of Being, and
through his words uses the creative principle in forming his
environment, good or bad. So we make our own heaven or hell.

The ideas that make words constructive are those of life, love, wisdom,
substance, power, strength, and all other ideas that express divine
attributes. Words carrying the life idea produce a vitalizing and
life-giving effect. Words that express divine love are harmonizing and
unifying in their effect.

Words are made active in the body through their receptivity by the mind
and are carried into the body through the subconsciousness by one's
thought. Constructive words that renew the body are made a part of the
body consciousness by prayer and meditation. These are the words that
are Spirit and give life.

Many people start out to walk in the light of Spirit, to unfold Truth,
but they become entangled in their own misgivings and disbelief and
therefore

<span id="page_77">p. 77</span>

return to their old limited way of life.

After these events Jesus went to Galilee (the "whirl of life"), for He
did not walk in Judea (praise) because the Jews sought to kill him. The
Jews (the Pharisaical Jews in this instance) believed in the letter of
the law rather than the spirit.
