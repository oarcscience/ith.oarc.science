###  John: Chapter 15 

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman.
2  
Every branch in me that beareth not fruit, he taketh it  
away: and every branch that beareth fruit, he cleanseth it,  
that it may bear more fruit.  
</span>

</div>

METAPHYSICALLY stated, the Father is the God-Mind; Jesus is the
individual incarnation of that Mind, here called the true vine. "Every
branch in me" means the faculties of mind, and the "fruit" is the
thought.

The law is that an unused faculty atrophies and withers away. This is
true of everything in existence. Inertia and nonuse soon bring
stagnation, corruption, death, and disintegration. We have accepted this
so universally as a fact of nature that its original character as an
intelligent force has been overlooked. All the teaching of the
Scriptures is that a failure to use a talent or faculty meets with a
reprimand from the Father-Mind. The over-careful servant who buried his
talent had it taken away from him and given to the one who had increased
his the most. This also has been observed in its negative aspect--a
faculty overused draws its vitality from the others and eventually
depletes them seriously, unless they are developed by balanced exercise.
This is a law of our being, and we should regard it as an intelligent
principle instead of a blind force, as we usually do.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">3 Already ye are clean because of the word which I
have  
spoken unto you. 4 Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch  
cannot bear fruit of itself,  
</span>

<span id="page_138">p. 138</span>

except it abide in the vine; so neither can ye, except ye  
abide in me. 5 I am the vine, ye are the branches: He that  
abideth in me, and I in him, the same beareth much fruit:  
for apart from me ye can do nothing. 6 If a man abide not  
in me, he is cast forth as a branch, and it is withered;  
and they gather them, and cast them into the fire, and they  
are burned. 7 If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you,  
ask whatsoever ye will, and it shall be done unto you. 8  
Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit; and  
so shall ye be my disciples. 9 Even as the Father hath  
loved me, I also have loved you: abide ye in my love. 10 If  
ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even as  
I have kept my Father's commandments, and abide in his  
love. 11 These things have I spoken unto you, that my joy  
may be in you, and that your joy may be made full. 12 This  
is my commandment, that ye love one another, even as I have  
loved you.  

</div>

The soul in conscious touch with the Father-Mind and striving to fulfill
the divine law brings the power of true words to bear in the purifying
and cleansing of its faculties. "Ye are clean because of the word which
I have spoken unto you." The necessity of abiding in the I AM in order
to bear much fruit is affirmed. When our faith attaches itself to outer
things, instead of the spiritual I AM, it ceases to draw vitality from
the one and only source of all life, divine Principle. The only door to
this life is the I AM. This abiding is a conscious centering of the mind
in the depths within us by means of repeated affirmations of our faith
and trust in it. This day-by-day repeating of affirmations finally opens
a channel of intelligent communication

<span id="page_139">p. 139</span>

with the silent forces at the depths of Being, thoughts and words flow
forth from there, and an entirely new source of power is developed in
the man.

When the thought or "word" of Truth from the supreme I AM of
consciousness, becomes an abiding fact in our mind, we need no longer
strive in external ways; we have but to express a deep desire in the
soul and it is fulfilled. "Ask whatsoever ye will, and it shall be done
unto you."

This constant affirming, with faith in the I AM within us, more and more
establishes us in command of the real forces of Being. The abiding in
the Spirit opens up the various spiritual powers one after the other.
Love is a great force that dissolves all the opposers of true thought
and thus smooths all the obstacles of life. This leads to joy, another
positive force that has not been bearing fruit because of the
obstructions heaped upon it by our failure to fulfill the law of
All-Good. This wonderful kingdom within the soul is developed through
the keeping of the "commandments"; that is, the commanding, controlling,
and directing of every thought according to the harmonious law of love
toward others. There is no occult mystery connected with this
development of the soul forces; it is simply thinking and acting in
terms of the law of love in our intercourse with our fellow men.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">13 Greater love hath no man than this, that a man
lay down  
his life for his friends. 14 Ye are my friends, if ye do  
the things which I command you. 15 No longer do I call you  
servants; for the servant  
</span>

<span id="page_140">p. 140</span>

knoweth not what his lord doeth: but I have called you  
friends; for all things that I heard from my Father I have  
made known unto you. 16 Ye did not choose me, but I chose  
you, and appointed you, that ye should go and bear fruit,  
and that your fruit should abide: that whatsoever ye shall  
ask of the Father in my name, he may give it you.  

</div>

In this Scripture we see Jesus realizing that His apostles had made
wonderful progress and were functioning on the spiritual plane.
Therefore, He no longer considered them of the world but knew definitely
that henceforth they were to do the works of Him that sent them. As
co-workers with Him, He called them "friends." In all His ministry Jesus
taught freedom of the individual. We are not "servants" but agents free
to do as we will.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">17 These things I command you, that ye may love
one  
another. 18 If the world hateth you, ye know that it hath  
hated me before it hated you. 19 If ye were of the world,  
the world would love its own: but because ye are not of the  
world, but I chose you out of the world, therefore the  
world hateth you. 20 Remember the word that I said unto  
you, A servant is not greater than his lord. If they  
persecuted me, they will also persecute you; if they kept  
my word, they will keep yours also. 21 But all these things  
will they do unto you for my name's sake, because they know  
not him that sent me. 22 If I had not come and spoken unto  
them, they had not had sin: but now they have no excuse for  
their sin. 23 He that hateth me hateth my Father also. 24  
If I had not done among them the works which none other  
did, they had not had sin: but now have they both seen and  
hated both me and my Father. 25 But this cometh to pass,  
that the word may be fulfilled that  
</span>

<span id="page_141">p. 141</span>

is written in their law, They hated me without a cause. 26  
But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you  
from the Father, even the Spirit of truth, which proceedeth  
from the Father, he shall bear witness of me: 27 and ye  
also bear witness, because ye have been with me from the  
beginning.  

</div>

The Comforter or Holy Spirit is the law of God in action, and when
thought of in this way it appears to have personality. From this truth
the Hebrews got their conception of the personal, tribal God.

The functions ascribed to the Holy Comforter or Holy Spirit or Spirit of
truth imply distinct personal subsistence: He is said to speak, search,
select, reveal, reprove, testify, lead, comfort, distribute to every
man, know the deep things of God, and He can be known by man only
through his spiritual nature.

(See John 14:25-31 for further interpretation.)
