###  John: Chapter 1 

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with
God,  
and the Word was God. 2 The same was in the beginning with  
God. 3 All things were made through him; and without him  
was not anything made that hath been made. 4 In him was  
life; and the life was the light of men. 5 And the light  
shineth in the darkness, and the darkness apprehended it  
not.  
</span>

</div>

IN PURE METAPHYSICS there is but one word, the Word of God. This is the
original creative Word or thought of Being. It is the "God said" of
Genesis. The Greek original refers to it in the 1st chapter of John as
the logos. The Greek word cannot be adequately translated into English.
In the original it denotes wisdom, judgment, power, and in fact all the
inherent potentialities of Being. This divine Logos was and always is in
God; in fact it is God as creative power. Divine Mind creates under law;
that is, spiritual law. Man may get a comprehension of the creative
process of Being by analyzing the action of his own mind. First is mind,
then the idea in mind of what the act is to be, then the act itself.
Thus the Word and the divine process of creating are identical.

Apart from mind nothing can be made. Even man, in his forming and
bringing anything into manifestation, uses the same creative process
that God used; to the degree that the qualities of the one Mind enter
into man's thought in the process his work will be enduring.

The divine idea--the Christ or Word of God--is always everywhere
present.

<span id="page_12">p. 12</span>

Among the four Gospels that of John is readily discerned by
metaphysicians as a symbolical life of Jesus and should appear first in
the New Testament, corresponding to the first chapters of Genesis. Quite
a few Bible critics so consider it, among them Ferrar Fenton, who gives
it first place in his "Complete Bible in Modern English."

John explains that all existence is spiritual, that it comes to man as a
gift, and that Christ is its fulfillment. "In the beginning was the
Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God."

"The Word" is the English translation of the Greek logos, which means a
thought or concept and also the word that is an expression or utterance
of the same. It also involves the logical relation between idea and
expression; hence our word logic, which also derives from logos.

Our attention is called to the 1st chapter of Genesis: "And the Spirit
of God moved upon the face of the waters. And God said, Let there be
light: and there was light."

Here in detail, day by day, or period by period, creation is ideated.

The parallel between Genesis and John is shown by the manifestation of
the ideal man. In Genesis Adam appears first. In John it is John the
Baptist, who is said to "bear witness" to the coming man, Jesus. In
Genesis man was given dominion over all things; in John "all things were
made through him."

John the Baptist represents the natural man, the physical man, who is
the nucleus around which the spiritual man builds. Man may be compared
to a

<span id="page_13">p. 13</span>

house, the foundation being rock, the superstructure lighter material.
The rock upon which Jesus built was not material: it was mental; its
symbol, Peter, was a mind receptive to spiritual Truth and spiritual
substance.

The first Adam was formed of the "dust of the ground," representing
radiant substance instead of gross earth.

So John the Baptist was more than the perfect physical man. He was the
illumined natural man. He preached and baptized his disciples and with
spiritual vision saw the unfoldment of the natural man into the Christ
man.

Spiritual man is the true light "which lighteth every man, coming into
the world." The world was made by him and yet "knew him not."

There is a creative force constantly at work in man and all creation,
but it is not recognized. It is Spirit-mind shining consciously in the
minds and hearts of those who recognize it. Those who ignore this light
do not "apprehend" it, and to them it is nonexistent.

"But as many as received him, to them gave he the right to become
children of God, even to them that believe on his name."

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">6 There came a man, sent from God, whose name was
John. 7  
The same came for witness, that he might bear witness of  
the light, that all might believe through him. 8 He was not  
the light, but came that he might bear witness of the light.  
</span>

</div>

Man in his darkened, ignorant state dwells in a realm of material
thoughts and perceives nothing

<span id="page_14">p. 14</span>

higher until he arrives at the point in his unfoldment where he is ready
to receive understanding of the Christ Truth. Then he enters into the
John the Baptist or intellectual perception of Truth. The intellectual
perception of Truth by the natural man (John the Baptist) is not the
true light (the Christ) but bears witness to the light and prepares the
way for its dawning in consciousness.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">9 There was the true light, even the light which
lighteth  
every man, coming into the world. 10 He was in the world,  
and the world was made through him, and the world knew him  
not. 11 He came unto his own, and they that were his own  
received him not.  
</span>

</div>

The true light (the Christ or Word) that lights every man coming into
the world is and ever has been in man. Even the outer man was formed and
came into existence through it. Up to a certain stage in his unfolding
man does not recognize this truth; now however this mystery, which is
"Christ in you, the hope of glory," is being revealed to the race with
more and more clarity and with greatly increased power.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">12 But as many as received him, to them gave he the
right  
to become children of God, even to them that believe on his  
name: 13 who were born, not of blood, nor of the will of  
the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.  
</span>

</div>

According to the 12th and 13th verses, the same truth that held good for
Jesus will hold good for as

<span id="page_15">p. 15</span>

many as receive Him (the Christ) and believe in His resurrecting power
as Jesus believed in it.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">14 And the Word became flesh, and dwelt among us
(and we  
beheld his glory, glory as of the only begotten from the  
Father), full of grace and truth.  
</span>

</div>

Jesus recognized this truth that the Christ, the divine-idea man or Word
of God, was His true self and that He was consequently the Son of God.
Because Jesus held to this perfect image of the divine man, the Christ
or Word entered consciously into every atom of His being, even to the
very cells of His outer organism, and transformed all His body into
pure, immortal, spiritual substance and life. Thus "the Word became
flesh." The resurrecting of His whole being included His body. Jesus
entered alive and entire into the spiritual realm.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">15 John beareth witness of him, and crieth, saying,
This  
was he of whom I said, He that cometh after me is become  
before me: for he was before me. 16 For of his fulness we  
all received, and grace for grace. 17 For the law was given  
through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ.  
18 No man hath seen God at any time; the only begotten Son,  
who is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him.  
</span>

</div>

"The law was given through Moses." Moses represents a phase of the
evolutionary process in man. "The law"--the outer commandments--cannot
redeem. "Grace and truth came through Jesus Christ"; that is, the real
saving, redeeming, transforming

<span id="page_16">p. 16</span>

power came to man through the work that Jesus did in establishing for
the race a new and higher consciousness in the earth. We can enter into
that consciousness by faith in Him and by means of the inner spirit of
the law that He taught and practiced.

The 18th verse teaches that through the Christ in us we come into an
understanding of the Father, since the Son (the Word) ever exists in
God, and Father and Son are one and are omnipresent in man and in the
universe. Spirit Truth is discerned through Spirit only; not in outer
ways or through intellectual perception do we come to know God.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">19 And this is the witness of John, when the Jews
sent unto  
him from Jerusalem priests and Levites to ask him, Who art  
thou? 20 And he confessed, and denied not; and he  
confessed, I am not the Christ. 21 And they asked him, What  
then? Art thou Elijah? And he saith, I am not. Art thou the  
prophet? And he answered, No. 22 They said therefore unto  
him, Who art thou? that we may give an answer to them that  
sent us. What sayest thou of thyself? 23 He said, I am the  
voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the  
way of the Lord, as said Isaiah the prophet. 24 And they  
had been sent from the Pharisees. 25 And they asked him,  
and said unto him, Why then baptizest thou, if thou art not  
the Christ, neither Elijah, neither the prophet? 26 John  
answered them, saying, I baptize in water: in the midst of  
you standeth one whom we know not, 27 even he that cometh  
after me, the latchet of whose shoe I am not worthy to  
unloose. 28 These things were done in Bethany beyond the  
Jordan, where John was baptizing.  
</span>

</div>

In the regeneration two states of mind are constantly

<span id="page_17">p. 17</span>

at work. First comes the cleansing or denial state, in which all the
error thoughts are eliminated. This includes forgiveness for sins
committed and a general clearing up of the whole consciousness. The idea
is to get back into the pure, natural consciousness of Spirit. This
state of mind is typified by John the Baptist, who came out of the
wilderness a child of nature whose mission it was to make straight the
way for One who was to follow.

This putting away of sin from the consciousness (baptism through denial,
plus forgiveness) is very closely allied to the deeper work that is to
follow; so much so that to the observer it seems the same. Hence the
followers of John, when they saw the works he did, asked if he was the
Messiah. His answer was that the One who followed him was to baptize
with Holy Spirit.

From this we discern that mental cleansing and the reforms that put the
conscious mind in order are designed to prepare the way for that larger
and more permanent consciousness which is to follow. This is the denial
of "self" or personality. Jesus said, "If any man would come after me,
let him deny himself." We are all guilty in a way of undue devotion to
personal aims, which are always narrow and selfish. So long as these
exist and take the place of the rightful One there is no room for the
higher self, the Christ of God.

The recorded "This is the Son of God" is a reference to a matter of
first importance in the regeneration. The recognition of man as the Son
of God and the establishment in the mind of the

<span id="page_18">p. 18</span>

new relations between the divine Father and the Son are essential to the
process. If we do not affirm our sonship, with all its privileges and
powers, we are sure to belittle ourselves and make limitations that
prevent us from entering into the fullness of the Godhead. "Be perfect,
as your heavenly Father is perfect."

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">29 On the morrow he seeth Jesus coming unto him, and
saith,  
Behold, the Lamb of God, that taketh away the sin of the  
world! 30 This is he of whom I said, After me cometh a man  
who is become before me: for he was before me. 31 And I  
knew him not; but that he should be made manifest to  
Israel, for this cause came I baptizing in water. 32 And  
John bare witness, saying, I have beheld the Spirit  
descending as a dove out of heaven; and it abode upon him.  
33 And I knew him not; but he that sent me to baptize in  
water, he said unto me, Upon whomsoever thou shalt see the  
Spirit descending, and abiding upon him, the same is he  
that baptizeth in the Holy Spirit. 34 And I have seen, and  
have borne witness that this is the Son of God.  
text  
Metaphysically interpreted, John the Baptist symbolizes in  
each individual the natural man, but with an illumined  
intellect. His face is turned toward the light in the  
measure that he recognizes and pays homage to the higher  
self within the individual. John baptized with water all  
those who believed that Jesus was soon to make His  
appearance. This is a cleansing, purifying process,  
preparing the individual to see spiritually and to discern  
spiritually.  
The Father-Mind is the living principle, the  
</span>

<span id="page_19">p. 19</span>

absolute, the unlimited. The Son is the living Word. "Word"  
is used to designate man's I AM identity. The Holy Spirit  
is the action or outpouring or activity of the living Word.  
This activity produces what may be termed the light of  
Spirit, the breath of God, the "personality" of Being. The  
outpouring of the Holy Spirit is the sign by which the  
natural man recognizes the divine. Jesus, who became the  
"Lamb of God" or perfect expression of God, baptized in the  
Holy Spirit.  

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">35 Again on the morrow John was standing, and two of
his  
disciples; 36 and he looked upon Jesus as he walked, and  
saith, Behold, the Lamb of God!  
</span>

</div>

By cultivation the spiritual mind becomes an active factor in
consciousness. It has to be desired and sought before it becomes a part
of one's conscious life. John the Baptist (the natural conscious mind)
is expecting, looking for, and earnestly desiring a greater realization
of Spirit. He knows that he is not fulfilling the Christ ideal of
manhood; hence his prophecy of One who is to come, "the latchet of whose
shoe" he is not worthy to loose.

This willingness to give up the natural man to the divine is a most
propitious sign in one who is in the regenerative process. Many persons
are ambitious to put on Christ, but are not willing to give up the
present man in order to do so. John the Baptist had a following, yet he
was willing that his disciples should go to Jesus. He openly
acknowledged Him as the "Lamb of God." This was his acknowledgment of
the Christ Mind. That mind has no personal ambition;

<span id="page_20">p. 20</span>

it is innocent, loving, and obedient to the call of God.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">37 And the two disciples heard him speak, and they
followed  
Jesus. 38 And Jesus turned, and beheld them following, and  
saith unto them, What seek ye? And they said unto him,  
Rabbi (which is to say, being interpreted, Teacher), where  
abidest thou? 39 He saith unto them, Come, and ye shall  
see. They came therefore and saw where he abode; and they  
abode with him that day: it was about the tenth hour. 40  
One of the two that heard John speak, and followed him, was  
Andrew, Simon Peter's brother. 41 He findeth first his own  
brother Simon, and saith unto him, We have found the  
Messiah (which is, being interpreted, Christ). 42 He  
brought him unto Jesus. Jesus looked upon him, and said,  
Thou art Simon the son of John: thou shalt be called Cephas  
(which is by interpretation, Peter).  
</span>

</div>

When the conscious mind recognizes the Christ Mind, the various
faculties gradually awaken and attach themselves to it. Andrew is the
first apostle mentioned, and with him was one whose name is not given
here but who is supposed to have been John (love). Love is modest and
retiring, "seeketh not its own." Andrew represents the strength of the
mind, which, greatly rejoiced when it finds the inexhaustible source of
all strength, exclaims, "We have found the Messiah."

Strength is clearly related to substance (Simon), which in spirit we
call faith. "Faith is the substance of things hoped for" (A.V.). What we
hope for and mentally see as a possibility in our life comes into
visibility, and we call it substantial.

<span id="page_21">p. 21</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">43 On the morrow he was minded to go forth into
Galilee,  
and he findeth Philip: and Jesus saith unto him, Follow me.  
44 Now Philip was from Bethsaida, of the city of Andrew and  
Peter. 45 Philip findeth Nathanael, and saith unto him, We  
have found him, of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets,  
wrote, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph. 46 And  
Nathanael said unto him, Can any good thing come out of  
Nazareth? Philip saith unto him, Come and see. 47 Jesus saw  
Nathanael coming to him, and saith of him, Behold, an  
Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile! 48 Nathanael saith  
unto him, Whence knowest thou me? Jesus answered and said  
unto him, Before Philip called thee, when thou wast under  
the fig tree, I saw thee. 49 Nathanael answered him, Rabbi,  
thou art the Son of God; thou art King of Israel. 50 Jesus  
answered and said unto him, Because I said unto thee, I saw  
thee underneath the fig tree, believest thou? thou shalt  
see greater things than these. 51 And he saith unto him,  
Verily, verly, I say unto you, Ye shall see the heaven  
opened, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon  
the Son of man.  
</span>

</div>

The name Philip means "lover of horses," and Philip is symbolic of the
vigor, power, vitality, and energy of the mind. Philip, Andrew, and
Peter are of the same "city," Bethsaida. The name Bethsaida means "house
of fishing," and Bethsaida signifies a group of thoughts in
consciousness that have as their central idea a belief in the increase
of ideas and their expression and manifestation in outer form.

Nathanael (representing the imagination) is also called Bartholomew. In
the realm of the real (Israel) the imaging power of the mind is
guileless, innocent of error images. It is open and receptive to the
beauty

<span id="page_22">p. 22</span>

and perfection of Being. It is the faculty of imagination that makes the
great artist and the great poet. It is the guileless innocence of the
Nathanael state of mind that causes the religious enthusiast to believe
all things about Spirit and the world invisible. Exercised without
Christ understanding, the imagination becomes delusory. It is the image
maker in the psychic; the clairvoyant may be deceived by its conjuring
power. In itself it is not error, but it may, like all the other
faculties, be used in erroneous ways. When the Mind of Spirit uses it,
as in the case of Jesus' discerning Nathanael when he was under the fig
tree, it is without guile; and in God's communication with man this
faculty plays an important part.

Among the apostles, Bartholomew represents the imagination. He is called
Nathanael in the 1st chapter of John, where it is recorded that Jesus
saw him under the fig tree, the inference being that He discerned
Nathanael's presence before the latter came into visibility. This would
indicate that images of people and things are projected into the imaging
chamber of the mind and that by giving them attention one can understand
their relation to outer things. Mind readers, clairvoyants, and dreamers
have developed this capacity to varying degree. Consciousness is what is
concerned with soul unfoldment both primarily, and secondarily and all
the way! Forms are always manifestations of ideas. Whoever understands
this can interpret the symbols shown him in dreams and visions, but lack
of understanding of this law makes one a psychic without discernment.

<span id="page_23">p. 23</span>

With this spiritual faculty it is possible for man to penetrate into the
"fourth dimension" or what is usually called the "kingdom of the
heavens" and to discern the trend of the spiritual forces. The angels of
God are spiritual forces active in the Sons of God, the spiritually
quickened.

The open and receptive and believing mind can see the things that take
place in the Christ Mind, thus transcending the capacity of the
unillumined natural man.
