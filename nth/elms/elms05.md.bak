### III

### THE UNITY OF THE SPIRIT.

<span class="smallcaps">We</span> have now paved the way for
understanding what is meant by "the unity of the spirit." In the first
conception of spirit as the underlying origin of all things we see a
universal substance which, at this stage, is not differentiated into any
specific forms. This is not a question of some bygone time, but subsists
at every moment of all time in the *innermost* nature of all being; and
when we see this, we see that the division between one specific form and
another has below it a deep essential unity, which acts as the supporter
of all the several forms of individuality arising out of it. And as our
thought penetrates deeper into the nature of this all-producing
spiritual substance we see that it cannot be limited to any one portion
of space, but must be limitless as space itself, and that the idea of
any portion of space where it is not is inconceivable. It is one of
those intuitive perceptions from which the human mind can never get away
that this primordial, all-generating living spirit must be commensurate
with infinitude, and we can therefore never think of it otherwise than
as universal or infinite. Now it is a mathematical

<span id="page_18">p. 18</span>

truth that the infinite must be a unity. You cannot have two infinites,
for then neither would be infinite, each would be limited by the other,
nor can you split the infinite up into fractions. The infinite is
mathematically essential unity. This is a point on which too much stress
cannot be laid, for there follow from it the most important
consequences. Unity, as such, can be neither multiplied nor divided, for
either operation destroys the unity. By multiplying, we produce a
plurality of units of the same scale as the original; and by dividing,
we produce a plurality of units of a smaller scale; and a plurality of
units is not unity but multiplicity. Therefore if we would penetrate
below the outward nature of the individual to that innermost principle
of his being from which his individuality takes its rise, we can do so
only by passing beyond the conception of individual existence into that
of the unity of universal being. This may appear to be a merely
philosophical abstraction, but the student who would produce practical
results must realize that these abstract generalizations are the
foundation of the practical work he is going to do.

Now the great fact to be recognized about a unity is that, *because* it
is a single unit, wherever it is at all the *whole* of it must be. The
moment we allow our mind to wander off to the idea of extension in space
and say that one part of the unit is here and another there, we have
descended from the idea of unity into

<span id="page_19">p. 19</span>

that of parts or fractions of a single unit, which is to pass into the
idea of a multiplicity of smaller units, and in that case we are dealing
with the relative, or the relation subsisting between two or more
entities which are therefore *limited by each other*, and so have passed
out of the region of simple unity which is the absolute. It is,
therefore, a mathematical necessity that, because the originating
Life-principle is infinite, it is a single unit, and consequently,
wherever it is at all, the *whole* of it must be present. But because it
is *infinite*, or limitless, it is everywhere, and therefore it follows
that the *whole* of spirit must be present at every point in space at
the same moment. Spirit is thus omnipresent *in its entirety*, and it is
accordingly logically correct that at every moment of time *all* spirit
is concentrated at any point in space that we may choose to fix our
thought upon. This is the fundamental fact of all being, and it is for
this reason that I have prepared the way for it by laying down the
relation between spirit and matter as that between idea and form, on the
one hand the absolute from which the elements of time and space are
entirely absent, and on the other the relative which is entirely
dependent on those elements. This great fact is that pure spirit
continually subsists in the absolute, whether in a corporeal body or
not; and from it all the phenomena of being flow, whether on the mental
plane or the physical. The knowledge of this fact

<span id="page_20">p. 20</span>

regarding spirit is the basis of all conscious spiritual operation, and
therefore in proportion to our increasing recognition of it our power of
producing outward visible results by the action of our thought will
grow. The whole is greater than its part, and therefore, if, by our
recognition of this unity, we can concentrate *all* spirit into any
given point at any moment, we thereby include any individualization of
it that we may wish to deal with. The practical importance of this
conclusion is too obvious to need enlarging upon.

Pure spirit is the Life-principle considered apart from the matrix in
which it takes relation to time and space in a particular form. In this
aspect it is pure intelligence undifferentiated into individuality. As
pure intelligence it is infinite responsiveness and susceptibility. As
devoid of relation to time and space it is devoid of individual
personality. It is, therefore, in this aspect a purely impersonal
element upon which, by reason of its inherent intelligence and
susceptibility, we can impress any recognition of personality that we
will. These are the great facts that the mental scientist works with,
and the student will do well to ponder deeply on their significance and
on the responsibilities which their realization must necessarily carry
with it.
