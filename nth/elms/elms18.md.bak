### XVI.

### THE SPIRIT.

<span class="smallcaps">What</span> must the Supreme All-originating
Spirit be in itself? That is the question before us. Let us start with
one fact regarding it about which we cannot have any possible doubt—it
is *creative*. If it were not creative nothing could come into
existence; therefore we know that its purpose, or Law of Tendency, must
be to bring individual lives into existence and to surround them with a
suitable environment. Now a power which has this for its inherent nature
must be a kindly power. The Spirit of Life seeking expression in
individual lives can have no other intention towards them than "that
they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly." To
suppose the opposite would be a contradiction in terms. It would be to
suppose the Eternal Principle of Life acting against itself, expressing
itself as the reverse of what it is, in which case it would not be
expressing itself but expressing its opposite; so that it is impossible
to conceive of the Spirit of Life acting otherwise than to the increase
of life. This is as yet only imperfectly apparent by reason of our
imperfect apprehension of the position, and our consequent

<span id="page_127">p. 127</span>

want of conscious unity with the ONE Eternal Life. As our consciousness
of unity becomes more perfect so will the life-givingness of the Spirit
become more apparent. But in the realm of principles the purely
Affirmative and Life-giving nature of the All-originating Spirit is an
unavoidable conclusion. Now by what name can we call such an inherent
desire to add to the fulness of any individual life—that is, to make it
stronger, brighter, and happier? If this is not Love, then I do not know
what else it is; and so we are philosophically led to the conclusion
that Love is the prime moving power of the Creating Spirit.

But expression is impossible without Form. What Form, then, should Love
give to the vehicles of its expression? By the hypothesis of the case it
could not find self-expression in forms that were hateful or repugnant
to it—therefore the only logical correlative of Love is Beauty. Beauty
is not yet universally manifested for the same reason that Life is not,
namely, lack of recognition of its Principle; but, that the principle of
Beauty is inherent in the Eternal Mind is demonstrated by all that is
beautiful in the world in which we live.

These considerations show us that the inherent nature of the Spirit must
consist in the eternal interaction of Love and Beauty as the Active and
Passive polarity of Being. Then this is the Power for the

<span id="page_128">p. 128</span>

working of which our soul faculties are specially adapted. And when this
purpose of the adaptation is recognized we begin to get some insight
into the way in which our intuition, imagination, and will should be
exercized. By training our thought to habitually dwell upon this
dual-unity of the Originating Forces of Love and Beauty the intuition is
rendered more and more sensitive to ideas emanating from this supreme
source, and the imagining faculty is trained in the formation of images
corresponding to such ideas; while on the physical side the molecular
structure of the brain and body becomes more and more perfectly adjusted
to the generating of vibratory currents tending to the outward
manifestation of the Originating Principle. Thus the whole man is
brought into unison with himself and with the Supreme Source of Life, so
that, in the words of St. Paul, he is being day by day renewed after the
image of Him that created him.

Our more immediately personal recognition of the All-originating Love
and Beauty will thus flow out as peace of mind, health of body,
discretion in the management of our affairs, and power in the carrying
out of our undertakings; and as we advance to a wider conception of the
working of the Spirit of Love and Beauty in its infinite possibilities,
so our intuition will find a wider scope and our field of activity will
expand along with it—in a word we shall

<span id="page_129">p. 129</span>

discover that our individuality is growing, and that we are becoming
more truly ourselves than we ever were before.

The question of the specific lines on which the individual may be most
perfectly trained into such recognition of his true relation to the
All-embracing Spirit of Life is therefore of supreme importance, but it
is also of such magnitude that even to briefly sketch its broad outlines
would require a volume to itself, and I will therefore not attempt to
enter upon it here, my present purpose being only to offer some hints of
the principles underlying that wonderful three-fold unity of Body, Soul,
and Spirit which we all know ourselves to be.

We are as yet only at the commencement of the path which leads to the
realization of this unity in the full development of all its powers, but
others have trodden the way before us, from whose experiences we may
learn; and not least among these was the illustrious founder of the Most
Christian Fraternity of the Rosicrucians. This master-mind, setting out
in his youth with the intention of going to Jerusalem, changed the order
of his journey and first sojourned for three years in the symbolical
city of Damcar, in the mystical country of Arabia, then for about a year
in the mystical country of Egypt, and then for two years in the mystical
country of Fez. Then, having during these six years learned all that was
to be

<span id="page_130">p. 130</span>

acquired in those countries, he returned to his native land of Germany,
where, on the basis of the knowledge he had thus gained, he founded the
Fraternity R.C., for whose instruction he wrote the mystical books M.
and T. Then, when he realized that his work in its present stage was
accomplished, he of his own free will laid aside the physical body, not,
it is recorded, by decay, or disease, or ordinary death, but by the
express direction of the Spirit of Life, summing up all his knowledge in
the words,

"Jesus mihi omnia."

And now his followers await the coming of "the Artist Elias," who shall
bring the Magnum Opus to its completion.

"Let him that readeth understand."
