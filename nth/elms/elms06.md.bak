### IV.

### SUBJECTIVE AND OBJECTIVE MIND.

<span class="smallcaps">Up</span> to this point it has been necessary to
lay the foundations of the science by the statement of highly abstract
general principles which we have reached by purely metaphysical
reasoning. We now pass on to the consideration of certain natural laws
which have been established by a long series of experiments and
observations, the full meaning and importance of which will become clear
when we see their application to the general principles which have
hitherto occupied our attention. The phenomena of hypnosis are now so
fully recognized as established scientific facts that it is quite
superfluous to discuss the question of their credibility. Two great
medical schools have been founded upon them, and in some countries they
have become the subject of special legislation. The question before us
at the present day is, not as to the credibility of the facts, but as to
the proper inferences to be drawn from them, and a correct apprehension
of these inferences is one of the most valuable aids to the mental
scientist, for it confirms the conclusions of purely *a priori*
reasoning by an array of experimental instances which places the
correctness of those conclusions beyond doubt.

<span id="page_22">p. 22</span>

The great truth which the science of hypnotism has brought to light is
the dual nature of the human mind. Much conflict exists between
different writers as to whether this duality results from the presence
of two actually separate minds in the one man, or in the action of the
same mind in the employment of different functions. This is one of those
distinctions without a difference which are so prolific a source of
hindrance to the opening out of truth. A man must be a single
individuality to be a man at all, and, so, the net result is the same
whether we conceive of his varied modes of mental action as proceeding
from a set of separate minds strung, so to speak, on the thread of his
one individuality and each adapted to a particular use, or as varied
functions of a single mind: in either case we are dealing with a single
individuality, and how we may picture the wheel-work of the mental
mechanism is merely a question of what picture will bring the nature of
its action home to us most clearly. Therefore, as a matter of
convenience, I shall in these lectures speak of this dual action as
though it proceeded from two minds, an outer and an inner, and the inner
mind we will call the subjective mind and the outer the objective, by
which names the distinction is most frequently indicated in the
literature of the subject.

A long series of careful experiments by highly-trained observers, some
of them men of world-wide reputation, has fully established certain
remarkable

<span id="page_23">p. 23</span>

differences between the action of the subjective and that of the
objective mind which may be briefly stated as follows. The subjective
mind is only able to reason *deductively* and not inductively, while the
objective mind can do both. Deductive reasoning is the pure syllogism
which shows why a third proposition must necessarily result if two
others are assumed, but which does not help us to determine whether the
two initial statements are true or not. To determine this is the
province of inductive reasoning which draws its conclusions from the
observation of a series of facts. The relation of the two modes of
reasoning is that, first by observing a sufficient number of instances,
we inductively reach the conclusion that a certain principle is of
general application, and then we enter upon the deductive process by
assuming the truth of this principle and determining what result must
follow in a particular case on the hypothesis of its truth. Thus
deductive reasoning proceeds on the assumption of the correctness of
certain hypotheses or suppositions with which it sets out: it is not
concerned with the truth or falsity of those suppositions, but only with
the question as to what results must necessarily follow supposing them
to be true. Inductive reasoning; on the other hand, is the process by
which we compare a number of separate instances with one another until
we see the common factor that gives rise to them all. Induction proceeds
by the comparison of

<span id="page_24">p. 24</span>

facts, and deduction by the application of universal principles. Now it
is the deductive method only which is followed by the subjective mind.
Innumerable experiments on persons in the hypnotic state have shown that
the subjective mind is utterly incapable of making the selection and
comparison which are necessary to the inductive process, but will accept
any suggestion, however false, but having once accepted any suggestion,
it is strictly logical in deducing the proper conclusions from it, and
works out every suggestion to the minutest fraction of the results which
flow from it.

As a consequence of this it follows that the subjective mind is entirely
under the control of the objective mind. With the utmost fidelity it
reproduces and works out to its final consequences whatever the
objective mind impresses upon it; and the facts of hypnotism show that
ideas can be impressed on the subjective mind by the objective mind of
another as well as by that of its own individuality. This is a most
important point, for it is on this amenability to suggestion by the
thought of another that all the phenomena of healing, whether present or
absent, of telepathy and the like, depend. Under the control of the
practised hypnotist the very personality of the subject becomes changed
for the time being; he believes himself to be whatever the operator
tells him he is: he is a swimmer breasting the waves, a bird flying in
the air,

<span id="page_25">p. 25</span>

a soldier in the tumult of battle, an Indian stealthily tracking his
victim: in short, for the time being, he identifies himself with any
personality that is impressed upon him by the will of the operator, and
acts the part with inimitable accuracy. But the experiments of hypnotism
go further than this, and show the existence in the subjective mind of
powers far transcending any exercised by the objective mind through the
medium of the physical senses; powers of thought-reading, of
thought-transference, of clairvoyance, and the like, all of which are
frequently manifested when the patient is brought into the higher
mesmeric state; and we have thus experimental proof of the existence in
ourselves of transcendental faculties the full development and conscious
control of which would place us in a perfectly new sphere of life.

But it should be noted that the control must be *our own* and not that
of any external intelligence whether in the flesh or out of it.

But perhaps the most important fact which hypnotic experiments have
demonstrated is that the subjective mind is the builder of the body. The
subjective entity in the patient is able to diagnose the character of
the disease from which he is suffering and to point out suitable
remedies, indicating a physiological knowledge exceeding that of the
most highly trained physicians, and also a knowledge of

<span id="page_26">p. 26</span>

the correspondences between diseased conditions of the bodily organs and
the material remedies which can afford relief. And from this it is but a
step further to those numerous instances in which it entirely dispenses
with the use of material remedies and itself works directly on the
organism, so that complete restoration to health follows as the result
of the suggestions of perfect soundness made by the operator to the
patient while in the hypnotic state.

Now these are facts fully established by hundreds of experiments
conducted by a variety of investigators in different parts of the world,
and from them we may draw two inferences of the highest importance: one,
that the subjective mind is in itself absolutely impersonal, and the
other that it is the builder of the body, or in other words it is the
creative power in the individual. That it is impersonal in itself is
shown by its readiness to assume any personality the hypnotist chooses
to impress upon it; and the unavoidable inference is that its
realization of personality proceeds from its association with the
particular objective mind of its own individuality. Whatever personality
the objective mind impresses upon it, that personality it assumes and
acts up to; and since it is the builder of the body it will build up a
body in correspondence with the personality thus impressed upon it.
These two laws of the subjective mind form the foundation of the axiom
that

<span id="page_27">p. 27</span>

our body represents the aggregate of our beliefs. If our fixed belief is
that the body is subject to all sorts of influences beyond our control,
and that this, that, or the other symptom shows that such an
uncontrollable influence is at work upon us, then this belief is
impressed upon the subjective mind, which by the law of its nature
accepts it without question and proceeds to fashion bodily conditions in
accordance with this belief. Again, if our fixed belief is that certain
material remedies are the only means of cure, then we find in this
belief the foundation of all medicine. There is nothing unsound in the
theory of medicine; it is the strictly logical correspondence with the
measure of knowledge which those who rely on it are as yet able to
assimilate, and it acts accurately in accordance with their belief that
in a large number of cases medicine will do good, but also in many
instances it fails. Therefore, for those who have not yet reached a more
interior perception of the law of Nature, the healing agency of medicine
is a most valuable aid to the alleviation of physical maladies. The
error to be combated is not the belief that, in its own way, medicine is
capable of doing good, but the belief that there is no higher or better
way.

Then, on the same principle, if we realize that the subjective mind is
the builder of the body, and that the body is subject to no influences
except those which

<span id="page_28">p. 28</span>

reach it through the subjective mind, then what we have to do is to
impress *this* upon the subjective mind and habitually think of it as a
fountain of perpetual Life, which is continually renovating the body by
building in strong and healthy material, in the most complete
independence of any influences of any sort, save those of our own desire
impressed upon our own subjective mind by our own thought. When once we
fully grasp these considerations we shall see that it is just as easy to
externalize healthy conditions of body as the contrary. Practically the
process amounts to a belief in our own power of life; and since this
belief, if it be thoroughly domiciled within us, will necessarily
produce a correspondingly healthy body, we should spare no pains to
convince ourselves that there are sound and reasonable grounds for
holding it. To afford a solid basis for this conviction is the purpose
of Mental Science.
