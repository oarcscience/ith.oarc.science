### II.

### THE HIGHER MODE OF INTELLIGENCE CONTROLS THE LOWER.

<span class="smallcaps">We</span> have seen that the descent from
personality, as we know it in ourselves, to matter, as we know it under
what we call inanimate forms, is a gradual descent in the scale of
intelligence from that mode of being which is able to realize its own
will-power as a capacity for originating new trains of causation to that
mode of being which is incapable of recognizing itself at all. The
higher the grade of life, the higher the intelligence; from which it
follows that the supreme principle of Life must also be the ultimate
principle of intelligence. This is clearly demonstrated by the grand
natural order of the universe. In the light of modern science the
principle of evolution is familiar to us all, and the accurate
adjustment existing between all parts of the cosmic scheme is too
self-evident to need insisting upon. Every advance in science consists
in discovering new subtleties of connection in this magnificent
universal order, which already exists and only needs our recognition to
bring it into practical use. If, then, the highest work of the greatest
minds consists in nothing else than the recognition of an already
existing order, there is no

<span id="page_9">p. 9</span>

getting away from the conclusion that a paramount intelligence must be
inherent in the Life-Principle, which manifests itself *as* this order;
and thus we see that there must be a great cosmic intelligence
underlying the totality of things.

The physical history of our planet shows us first an incandescent nebula
dispersed over vast infinitudes of space; later this condenses into a
central sun surrounded by a family of glowing planets hardly yet
consolidated from the plastic primordial matter; then succeed untold
millenniums of slow geological formation; an earth peopled by the lowest
forms of life, whether vegetable or animal; from which crude beginnings
a majestic, unceasing, unhurried, forward movement brings things stage
by stage to the condition in which we know them now. Looking at this
steady progression it is clear that, however we may conceive the nature
of the evolutionary principle, it unerringly provides for the continual
advance of the race. But it does this by creating such numbers of each
kind that, after allowing a wide margin for all possible accidents to
individuals, the race shall still continue:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"So careful of the type it seems  
 So careless of the single life."</span>

</div>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> In short, we may
say that the cosmic intelligence works by a Law of Averages which allows
a wide margin of accident and failure to the individual.

<span id="page_10">p. 10</span>

But the progress towards higher intelligence is always in the direction
of narrowing down this margin of accident and taking the individual more
and more out of the law of averages, and substituting the law of
individual selection. In ordinary scientific language this is the
survival of the fittest. The reproduction of fish is on a scale that
would choke the sea with them if every individual survived; but the
margin of destruction is correspondingly enormous, and thus the law of
averages simply keeps up the normal proportion of the race. But at the
other end of the scale, reproduction is by no means thus enormously in
excess of survival. True, there is ample margin of accident and disease
cutting off numbers of human beings before they have gone through the
average duration of life, but still it is on a very different scale from
the premature destruction of hundreds of thousands as against the
survival of one. It may, therefore, be taken as an established fact that
in proportion as intelligence advances the individual ceases to be
subject to a mere law of averages and has a continually increasing power
of controlling the conditions of his own survival.

We see, therefore, that there is a marked distinction between the cosmic
intelligence and the individual intelligence, and that the factor which
differentiates the latter from the former is the presence of
*individual* volition. Now the business of Mental Science

<span id="page_11">p. 11</span>

is to ascertain the relation of this individual power of volition to the
great cosmic law which provides for the maintenance and advancement of
the race; and the point to be carefully noted is that the power of
individual volition is itself the outcome of the cosmic evolutionary
principle at the point where it reaches its highest level. The effort of
Nature has always been upwards from the time when only the lowest forms
of life peopled the globe, and it has now culminated in the production
of a being with a mind capable of abstract reasoning and a brain fitted
to be the physical instrument of such a mind. At this stage the
all-creating Life-principle reproduces itself in a form capable of
recognizing the working of the evolutionary law, and the unity and
continuity of purpose running through the whole progression until now
indicates, beyond a doubt, that the place of such a being in the
universal scheme must be to introduce the operation of that factor
which, up to this point, has been, conspicuous by its absence—the
factor, namely, of intelligent individual volition. The evolution which
has brought us up to this standpoint has worked by a cosmic law of
averages; it has been a process in which the individual himself has not
taken a conscious part. But because he is what he is, and leads the van
of the evolutionary procession, if man is to evolve further, it can now
only be by his own conscious co-operation with the law which has brought
him up to

<span id="page_12">p. 12</span>

the standpoint where he is able to realize that such a law exists. His
evolution in the future must be by conscious participation in the great
work, and this can only be effected by his own individual intelligence
and effort. It is a process of intelligent growth. No one else can grow
for us: we must each grow for ourselves; and this intelligent growth
consists in our increasing recognition of the universal law, which has
brought us as far as we have yet got, and of our own individual relation
to that law, based upon the fact that we ourselves are the most advanced
product of it. It is a great maxim that Nature obeys us precisely in
proportion as we first obey Nature. Let the electrician try to go
counter to the principle that electricity must always pass from a higher
to a lower potential and he will effect nothing; but let him submit in
all things to this one fundamental law, and he can make whatever
particular applications of electrical power he will.

These considerations show us that what differentiates the higher from
the lower degree of intelligence is the recognition of its own
self-hood, and the more intelligent that recognition is, the greater
will be the power. The lower degree of self-recognition is that which
only realizes itself as an entity separate from all other entities, as
the *ego* distinguished from the *non-ego*. But the higher degree of
self-recognition is that which, realizing its own spiritual nature, sees

<span id="page_13">p. 13</span>

in all other forms, not so much the *non-ego*, or that which is not
itself, as the *alter-ego*, or that which is itself in a different mode
of expression. Now, it is this higher degree of self-recognition that is
the power by which the Mental Scientist produces his results. For this
reason it is imperative that he should clearly understand the difference
between Form and Being; that the one is the mode of the relative and,
the mark of subjection to conditions, and that the other is the truth of
the absolute and is that which controls conditions.

Now this higher recognition of self as an individualization of pure
spirit must of necessity control all modes of spirit which have not yet
reached the same level of self-recognition. These lower modes of spirit
are in bondage to the law of their own being because they do not know
the law; and, therefore, the individual who has attained to this
knowledge can control them through that law. But to understand this we
must inquire a little further into the nature of spirit. I have already
shown that the grand scale of adaptation and adjustment of all parts of
the cosmic scheme to one another exhibits the presence *somewhere* of a
marvellous intelligence, underlying the whole, and the question is,
where is this intelligence to be found? Ultimately we can only conceive
of it as inherent in some primordial substance which is the root of all
those grosser modes of matter which are known to

<span id="page_14">p. 14</span>

us, whether visible to the physical eye, or necessarily inferred by
science from their perceptible effects. It is that power which, in every
species and in every individual, becomes that which that species or
individual is; and thus we can only conceive of it as a self-forming
intelligence inherent in the ultimate substance of which each thing is a
particular manifestation. That this primordial substance must be
considered as self-forming by an inherent intelligence abiding in itself
becomes evident from the fact that intelligence is the essential quality
of spirit; and if we were to conceive of the primordial substance as
something apart from spirit, then we should have to postulate some other
power which is neither spirit nor matter, and originates both; but this
is only putting the idea of a self-evolving power a step further back
and asserting the production of a lower grade of undifferentiated spirit
by a higher, which is both a purely gratuitous assumption and a
contradiction of any idea we can form of undifferentiated spirit at all.
However far back, therefore, we may relegate the original
starting-point, we cannot avoid the conclusion that, at that point,
spirit contains the primary substance in itself, which brings us back to
the common statement that it made everything out of nothing. We thus
find two factors to the making of all things, Spirit and—Nothing; and
the addition of Nothing to Spirit leaves *only* spirit: x + 0 = x.

<span id="page_15">p. 15</span>

From these considerations we see that the ultimate foundation of every
form of matter is spirit, and hence that a universal intelligence
subsists throughout Nature inherent in every one of its manifestations.
But this cryptic intelligence does not belong to the particular *form*
excepting in the measure in which it is physically fitted for its
concentration into self-recognizing individuality: it lies hidden in
that primordial substance of which the visible form is a grosser
manifestation. This primordial substance is a philosophical necessity,
and we can only picture it to ourselves as something infinitely finer
than the atoms which are themselves a philosophical inference of
physical science: still, for want of a better word, we may conveniently
speak of this primary intelligence inherent in the very substance of
things as the Atomic Intelligence. The term may, perhaps, be open to
some objections, but it will serve our present purpose as distinguishing
*this* mode of spirit's intelligence from that of the opposite pole, or
Individual Intelligence. This distinction should be carefully noted
because it is by the response of the atomic intelligence to the
individual intelligence that thought-power is able to produce results on
the material plane, as in the cure of disease by mental treatment, and
the like. Intelligence manifests itself by responsiveness, and the whole
action of the cosmic mind in bringing the evolutionary process from its
first beginnings up to its

<span id="page_16">p. 16</span>

present human stage is nothing else but a continual intelligent response
to the demand which each stage in the progress has made for an
adjustment between itself and its environment. Since, then, we have
recognized the presence of a universal intelligence permeating all
things, we must also recognize a corresponding responsiveness hidden
deep down in their nature and ready to be called into action when
appealed to. All mental treatment depends on this responsiveness of
spirit in its lower degrees to higher degrees of itself. It is here that
the difference between the mental scientist and the uninstructed person
comes in; the former knows of this responsiveness and makes use of it,
and the latter cannot use it because he does not know it.
