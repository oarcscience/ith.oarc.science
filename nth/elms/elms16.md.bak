### XIV.

### THE BODY.

<span class="smallcaps">Some</span> students find it difficult to
realize that mental action can produce any real effect upon material
substance; but if this is not possible there is no such thing as Mental
Science, the purpose of which is to produce improved conditions both of
body and environment, so that the ultimate manifestation aimed at is
always one of demonstration upon the plane of the visible and concrete.
Therefore to afford conviction of an actual connection between the
visible and the invisible, between the inner and the outer, is one of
the most important points in the course of our studies.

That such a connection must exist is proved by metaphysical argument in
answer to the question, "How did anything ever come into existence at
all?" And the whole creation, ourselves included, stands as evidence to
this great truth. But to many minds merely abstract argument is not
completely convincing, or at any rate it becomes more convincing if it
is supported by something of a more concrete nature; and for such
readers I would give a few hints as to the correspondence between the
physical and

<span id="page_108">p. 108</span>

the mental. The subject covers a very wide area, and the limited space
at my disposal will only allow me to touch on a few suggestive points,
still these may be sufficient to show that the abstract argument has
some corresponding facts at the back of it.

One of the most convincing proofs I have seen is that afforded by the
"biometre," a little instrument invented by an eminent French scientist,
the late Dr. Hippolyte Baraduc, which shows the action of what he calls
the "vital current." His theory is that this force, whatever its actual
nature may be, is universally present, and operates as a current of
physical vitality perpetually, flowing with more or less energy through
every physical organism, and which can, at any rate to some extent, be
controlled by the power of the human will. The theory in all its
minutiae is exceedingly elaborate, and has been described in detail in
Dr. Baraduc's published works. In a conversation I had with him about a
year ago, he told me he was writing another book which would throw
further light on the subject, but a few months later he passed over
before it was presented to the world. The fact, however, which I wish to
put before the reader, is the ocular demonstration of the connection
between mind and matter, which an experiment with the biometre affords.

The instrument consists of a bell glass, from the inside of which is
suspended a copper needle by a

<span id="page_109">p. 109</span>

fine silken thread. The glass stands on a wooden support, below which is
a coil of copper wire, which, however, is not connected with any battery
or other apparatus, and merely serves to condense the current. Below the
needle, inside the glass, there is a circular card divided into degrees
to mark the action of the needle. Two of these instruments are placed
side by side, but in no way connected, and the experimenter then holds
out the fingers of both hands to within about an inch of the glasses.
According to the theory, the current enters at the left hand, circulates
through the body, and passes out at the right hand, that is to say,
there is an indrawing at the left and a giving-out at the right, thus
agreeing with Reichenbach's experiments on the polarity of the human
body.

I must confess that, although I had read Dr. Baraduc's book, "Les
Vibrations Humaines," I approached the instrument in a very sceptical
frame of mind; but I was soon convinced of my error. At first, holding a
mental attitude of entire relaxation, I found that the left-hand needle
was attracted through twenty degrees, while the right-hand needle, the
one affected by the out-going current, was repelled through ten degrees.
After allowing the instrument to return to its normal equilibrium I
again approached it with the purpose of seeing whether a change of
mental attitude would in the least modify

<span id="page_110">p. 110</span>

the flow of current. This time I assumed the strongest mental attitude I
could with the intention of sending out a flow through the right hand,
and the result as compared with the previous one was remarkable. The
left-hand needle was now attracted only through ten degrees, while the
right-hand one was deflected through something over thirty, thus clearly
indicating the influence of the mental faculties in modifying the action
of the current. I may mention that the experiment was made in the
presence of two medical men who noted the movement of the needles.

I will not here stop to discuss the question of what the actual
constitution of this current of vital energy may be—it is sufficient for
our present purpose that it is there, and the experiment I have
described brings us face to face with the fact of a correspondence
between our own mental attitude and the invisible forces of nature. Even
if we say that this current is some form of electricity, and that the
variation of its action is determined by changes in the polarization of
the atoms of the body, then this change of polarity is the result of
mental action; so that the quickening or retarding of the cosmic current
is equally the result of the mental attitude whether we suppose our
mental force to act directly upon the current itself or indirectly by
inducing changes in the molecular structure of the body. Whichever
hypothesis we adopt the conclusion is the same, namely,

<span id="page_111">p. 111</span>

that the mind has power to open or close the door to invisible forces in
such a way that the result of the mental action becomes apparent on the
material plane.

Now, investigation shows that the physical body, is a mechanism
specially adapted for the transmutation of the inner or mental power
into modes of external activity. We know from medical science that the
whole body is traversed by a network of nerves which serve as the
channels of communication between the indwelling spiritual ego, which we
call mind, and the functions of the external organism. This nervous
system is dual. One system, known as the Sympathetic, is the channel for
all those activities which are not consciously directed by our volition,
such as the operation of the digestive organs, the repair of the daily
wear and tear of the tissues, and the like. The other system, known as
the Voluntary or Cerebro-spinal system, is the channel through which we
receive conscious perception from the physical senses and exercise
control over the movements of the body. This system has its centre in
the brain, while the other has its centre in a ganglionic mass at the
back of the stomach known as the solar plexus, and sometimes spoken of
as the abdominal brain. The cerebro-spinal system is the channel of our
volitional or conscious mental action, and the sympathetic system is the
channel of that mental action which unconsciously

<span id="page_112">p. 112</span>

supports the vital functions of the body. Thus the cerebro-spinal system
is the organ of conscious mind and the sympathetic is that of
sub-conscious mind.

But the interaction of conscious and subconscious mind requires a
similar interaction between the corresponding systems of nerves, and one
conspicuous connection by which this is provided is the "vagus" nerve.
This nerve passes out of the cerebral region as a portion of the
voluntary system, and through it we control the vocal organs; then it
passes onwards to the thorax sending out branches to the heart and
lungs; and finally, passing through the diaphragm, it loses the outer
coating which distinguishes the nerves of the voluntary system and
becomes identified with those of the sympathetic system, so forming a
connecting link between the two and making the man physically a single
entity.

Similarly different areas of the brain indicate, their connection with
the objective and subjective activities of the mind respectively, and
speaking in a general way we may assign the frontal portion of the brain
to the former and the posterior portion to the latter, while the
intermediate portion partakes of the character of both.

The intuitional faculty has its correspondence in this upper area of the
brain situated between the frontal and posterior portions, and
physiologically

<span id="page_113">p. 113</span>

speaking, it is here that intuitive ideas find entrance. These at first
are more or less unformed and generalized in character, but are
nevertheless perceived by the conscious mind, otherwise we should not be
aware of them at all. Then the effort of nature is to bring these ideas
into more definite and usable shape, so the conscious mind lays hold of
them and induces a corresponding vibratory current in the voluntary
system of nerves, and this in turn induces a similar current in the
involuntary system, thus handing the idea over to the subjective mind.
The vibratory current which had first descended from the apex of the
brain to the frontal brain and thus through the voluntary system to the
solar plexus is now reversed and ascends from the solar plexus through
the sympathetic system to the posterior brain, this return current
indicating the action of the subjective mind.

If we were to remove the surface portion of the apex of the brain we
should find immediately below it the shining belt of brain substance
called the "corpus callosum." This is the point of union between the
subjective and objective, and as the current returns from the solar
plexus to this point it is restored to the objective portion of the
brain in a fresh form which it has acquired by the silent alchemy of the
subjective mind. Thus the conception which was at first only vaguely
recognized is restored to the objective mind in a definite and workable
form,

<span id="page_114">p. 114</span>

and then the objective mind, acting through the frontal brain—the area
of comparison and analysis—proceeds to work upon a clearly perceived
idea and to bring out the potentialities that are latent in it.

It must of course be borne in mind that I am here speaking of the mental
ego in that, mode of its existence with which we are most familiar, that
is as clothed in flesh, though there may be much to say as to other
modes of its activity. But for our daily life we have to consider
ourselves as we are in that aspect of life, and from this point of view
the physiological correspondence of the body to the action of the mind
is an important item; and therefore, although we must always remember
that the origin of ideas is purely mental, we must not forget that on
the physical plane every mental action implies a corresponding molecular
action in the brain and in the two-fold nervous system.

If, as the old Elizabethan poet says, "the soul is form, and doth the
body make," then it is clear that the physical organism must be a
mechanical arrangement as specially adapted for the use of the soul's
powers as a steam-engine is for the power of steam; and it is the
recognition of this reciprocity between the two that is the basis of all
spiritual or mental healing, and therefore the study of this mechanical
adaptation is an important branch of Mental Science.

<span id="page_115">p. 115</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Only we must not
forget that it is the effect and not the cause.

At the same time it is important to remember that such a thing as
reversal of the relation between cause and effect is possible, just as
the same apparatus may be made to generate mechanical power by the
application of electricity, or to generate electricity by the
application of mechanical power. And the importance of this principle
consists in this. There is always a tendency for actions which were at
first voluntary to become automatic, that is, to pass from the region of
conscious mind into that of subconscious mind, and to acquire a
permanent domicile there. Professor Elmer Gates, of Washington, has
demonstrated this physiologically in his studies of brain formation. He
tells us that every thought produces a slight molecular change in the
substance of the brain, and the repetition of the same sort of thought
causes a repetition of the same molecular action until at last a
veritable channel is formed in the brain substance, which can only be
eradicated by a reverse process of thought. In this way "grooves of
thought" are very literal things, and when once established the
vibrations of the cosmic currents flow automatically through them and
thus react upon the mind by a process the reverse of that by which our
voluntary and intentional in-drawing from the invisible is affected. In
this way are formed what we call "habits," and hence the importance

<span id="page_116">p. 116</span>

of controlling our thinking and guarding it against undesirable ideas.

But on the other hand this reactionary process may be used to confirm
good and life-giving modes of thought, so that by a knowledge of its
laws we may enlist even the physical body itself in the building up of
that perfectly whole personality, the attainment of which is the aim and
object of our studies.
