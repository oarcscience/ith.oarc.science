### VIII.

### RECIPROCAL ACTION OF THE UNIVERSAL AND INDIVIDUAL MINDS.

It must be admitted that the foregoing considerations bring us to the
borders of theological speculation, but the student must bear in mind
that as a Mental Scientist it is his business to regard even the most
exalted spiritual phenomena from a purely scientific standpoint, which
is that of the working of a universal natural Law. If he thus simply
deals with the facts as he finds them, there is little doubt that the
true meaning of many theological statements will become clear to him:
but he will do well to lay it down as a general rule that it is not
necessary either to the use or understanding of any law, whether on the
personal or the impersonal side of Nature, that we should give a
theological explanation of it: although, therefore, the personal quality
inherent in the universal underlying spirit, which is present in all
things, cannot be too strongly insisted upon, we must remember that in
dealing with it we are still dealing with a purely natural power which
reappears at every point with protean variety of form, whether as
person, animal, or thing. In each case what it becomes

<span id="page_56">p. 56</span>

to any individual is exactly measured by that individual's recognition
of it. To each and all it bears the relation of supporter of the race,
and where the individual development is incapable of realizing anything
more, this is the limit of the relation; but as the individual's power
of recognition expands, he finds a reciprocal expansion on the part of
this intelligent power which gradually develops into the consciousness
of intimate companionship between the individualized mind and the
unindividualized source of it.

Now this is exactly the relation which, on ordinary scientific
principles, we should expect to find between the individual and the
cosmic mind, on the supposition that the cosmic mind is subjective mind,
and for reasons already given we can regard it in no other light. As
subjective mind it must reproduce exactly the conception of itself which
the objective mind of the individual, acting through his own subjective
mind, impresses upon it; and at the same time as creative mind, it
builds up external facts in correspondence with this conception. "Quot
homines tot sententiæ": each one externalizes in his outward
circumstances precisely his idea of the Universal Mind; and the man who
realizes that by the natural law of mind he can bring the Universal Mind
into perfectly reciprocal action with its own, will on the one hand make
it a source of infinite instruction, and on the other a source of
infinite power. He will thus

<span id="page_57">p. 57</span>

wisely alternate the personal and impersonal aspects respectively
between his individual mind and the Universal Mind; when he is seeking
for guidance or strength he will regard his own mind as the impersonal
element which is to *receive personality* from the superior wisdom and
force of the Greater Mind; and when, on the other hand, he is to give
out the stores thus accumulated, he must reverse the position and
consider his own mind as the personal element, and the Universal Mind as
the impersonal, which he can therefore *direct* with certainty by
impressing his own personal desire upon it. We need not be staggered at
the greatness of this conclusion, for it follows necessarily from the
natural relation between the subjective and the objective minds; and the
only question is whether we will limit our view to the lower level of
the latter, or expand it so as to take in the limitless possibilities
which the subjective mind presents to us.

I have dealt with this question at some length because it affords the
key to two very important subjects, the Law of Supply and the nature of
Intuition. Students often find it easier to understand how the mind can
influence the body with which it is so intimately associated, than how
it can influence circumstances. If the operation of thought-power were
confined exclusively to the individual mind this difficulty might arise;
but if there is one lesson the student of Mental Science should take to
heart

<span id="page_58">p. 58</span>

more than another, it is that the action of thought-power is not limited
to a circumscribed individuality. What the individual does is to *give
direction* to something which is unlimited, to call into action a force
infinitely greater than his own, which because it is in itself
impersonal though intelligent, will receive the impress of his
personality, and can therefore make its influence felt far beyond the
limits which bound the individual's objective perception of the
circumstances with which he has to deal. It is for this reason that I
lay so much stress on the combination of two apparent opposites in the
Universal Mind, the union of intelligence with impersonality. The
intelligence not only enables it to receive the impress of our thought,
but also causes it to devise exactly the right *means* for bringing it
into accomplishment. This is only the logical result of the hypothesis
that we are dealing with infinite Intelligence which is also infinite
Life. Life means Power, and infinite life therefore means limitless
power; and limitless power moved by limitless intelligence cannot be
conceived of as ever stopping short of the accomplishment of its object;
therefore, given the *intention* on the part of the Universal Mind,
there can be no doubt as to its ultimate accomplishment. Then comes the
question of intention. How do we know what the intention of the
Universal Mind may be? Here comes in the element of impersonality.

<span id="page_59">p. 59</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> It has *no
intention*, because it is *impersonal*. As I have already said, the
Universal mind works by a law of averages for the advancement of the
race, and is in no way concerned with the particular wishes of the
individual. If his wishes are in line with the forward movement of the
everlasting principle, there is nowhere in Nature any power to restrict
him in their fulfilment. If they are opposed to the general forward
movement, then they will bring him into collision with it, and it will
crush him. From the relation between them it results that the same
principle which shows itself in the individual mind as Will, becomes in
the universal mind a Law of Tendency; and the direction of this tendency
must always be to life-givingness, because the universal mind is the
undifferentiated Life-spirit of the universe. Therefore in every case
the test is whether our particular intention is in this same lifeward
direction: and if it is, then we may be absolutely certain that there is
no intention on the part of the Universal Mind to thwart the intention
of our own individual mind; we are dealing with a purely impersonal
force, and it will no more oppose us by specific plans of its own than
will steam or electricity. Combining then, these two aspects of the
Universal Mind, its utter impersonality and its perfect intelligence, we
find precisely the sort of natural force we are in want of, something
which will undertake whatever we put

<span id="page_60">p. 60</span>

into its hands without asking questions or bargaining for terms, and
which, having undertaken our business, will bring to bear on it an
intelligence to which the united knowledge of the whole human race is as
nothing, and a power equal to this intelligence. I may be using a rough
and ready mode of expression, but my object is to bring home to the
student the nature of the power he can employ and the method of
employing it, and I may therefore state the whole position thus:—Your
object is not to run the whole cosmos, but to draw particular benefits,
physical, mental, moral, or financial into your own or someone else's
life. From this individual point of view the universal creative power
has no mind of its own, and therefore you can make up its mind for it.
When its mind is thus made up for it, it never abrogates its place as
the creative power, but at once sets to work co carry out the purpose
for which it has thus been concentrated; and unless this concentration
is dissipated by the same agency (yourself) which first produced it, it
will work on by the law of growth to complete manifestation on the
outward plane.

In dealing with this great impersonal intelligence, we are dealing with
the infinite, and we must fully realize infinitude as that which touches
all points, and if it does, there should be no difficulty in
understanding that this intelligence can draw together the means
requisite for its purpose even from the ends

<span id="page_61">p. 61</span>

of the world; and therefore, realizing the Law according to which the
result can be produced, we must resolutely put aside all questioning as
to the specific means which will be employed in any case. To question
this is to sow that very seed of doubt which it is our first object to
eradicate, and our intellectual endeavour should therefore be directed,
not to the attempt to foretell the various secondary causes which will
eventually combine to produce the desired result, laying down beforehand
what particular causes should be necessary, and from what quarter they
should come; but we should direct our intellectual endeavour to seeing
more clearly the rationale of the general law by which trains of
secondary causes are set in motion. Employed in the former way our
intellect becomes the greatest hindrance to our success, for it only
helps to increase our doubts, since it is trying to grasp particulars
which, at the time are entirely outside its circle of vision; but
employed in the latter it affords the most material aid in maintaining
that nucleus without which there is no centre from which the principle
of growth can assert itself. The intellect can only deduce consequences
from facts which it is able to state, and consequently cannot deduce any
assurance from facts of whose existence it cannot yet have any knowledge
through the medium of the outward senses; but for the same reason it can
realize the existence of a *Law* 

<span id="page_62">p. 62</span>

by which the as yet unmanifested circumstances may be brought into
manifestation. Thus used in its right order, the intellect becomes the
handmaid of that more interior power within us which manipulates the
unseen substance of all things, and which we may call relative first
cause.
