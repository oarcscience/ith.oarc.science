The New Thought movement, which originated in the late 19th and early
20th century, has at its core a belief that a higher power pervades all
existence, and that individuals can create their own reality via
affirmations, meditation and prayer. Early New Thought groups emerged
from a Christian Science background, and many New Thought writers refer
back to the Bible as their foundation text. New Thought resembles in
some respects New Age philosophy, although some New Thought groups
dismiss a connection. This page includes some of the writings of this
movement, as well as related and similar texts.
