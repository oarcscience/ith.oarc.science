### ADDENDUM

The full exploration of the possibilities of working with the High Self,
once contact is made through the use of self-suggestion, has not been
completed.

At this time we cannot say what miracles can be performed with the help
of the High Self, but, looking back at the instant healing accomplished
by the kahunas of yesterday, we are encouraged to expect great and
wonderful things.

In India, where self-suggestion after the Huna manner has been practiced
for centuries by the devotees of Yoga, the belief that one must suffer
in order to repay karmic indebtedness has prevented the use of healing
potentials.

To list the possibilities, once full working contact is established
between the three selves, we may safely put down:

1\. Miraculous healing, both instant and slow.

2\. Seeing to a limited extent into the future.

3\. Obtaining High Self guidance and help.

Here in the Western world, where we are in our first approach to this
part of the field, we are, however, not without instances of partial
development of the abilities in question.

On pages 316–317 of "The Secret Science Behind Miracles" may be found
the story of one of the first American mesmerists, Phineas Quimby, and
an account of how, under mesmeric control, his favorite subject, Lucius,
was accidentally found to be able to exhibit supernormal abilities. He
could see what was going on at a distance, and could diagnose physical
ills and heal them. Quimby had long suffered from kidney trouble and was
healed by the laying on of a

<span id="page_115">p. 115</span>

hand by Lucius while under mesmeric influence but suddenly seeming to
act of his own volition. This healing was instantaneous, and it lasted.
That it was accomplished by something wiser and more able than the
normal Lucius was evident to the mind of Quimby, and, while he had no
knowledge of Huna, of course, he attributed the strange powers to some
Consciousness higher than man and lower than Ultimate God. He called it
the "Wisdom" or the "Power".

It makes no difference whether this contact with the High Self
"Wisdom-Power" was made through the use of mesmerism or not. Hypnotic
suggestion or self-suggestion would have accomplished the same results.

A more modern and well documented case which falls under the same
classification is that of the late Edgar Cayce. In a trance condition
usually induced by hypnotic suggestion administered by an associate, he
exhibited abilities not possessed in his normal state. While this
ability did not include such instant and direct healing as that
exhibited by Quimby's subject, Lucius, it included similar prescriptions
of remedies and the same diagnostic procedure.

Judging from the records of Quimby, the full contact with the "Wisdom"
was rare on the part of Lucius, and many times a diagnosis and
prescription proved to be useless. On the other hand, if Cayce failed to
make a correct diagnosis or to describe the right remedy, little is said
of it in the books which tell of his life and work.

Cayce frequently found obscure causes of illness or pain. In one
instance he diagnosed the illness of a young man as something caused by
a cracked vertebra in his neck. He then stated that a special form of
operation was needed to correct the trouble, and

<span id="page_116">p. 116</span>

that there was only one doctor skilled in this technique. Asked who this
doctor might be and where he was to be found, he gave his name and
Boston address, adding that at the moment he was in Europe, but that on
a certain date he would return. This information was found later to be
correct from first to last. The doctor operated and the young man
recovered. Many such cases were recorded, and the transcribed records
are still in process of being studied and classified by an organization
headed by his son, Hugh, formed to carry on this work.

It is interesting to note that Cayce advanced no set theory to explain
his work. He knew that he made contact in trance conditions with some
source of information far wiser and more able than himself. On one point
he stood firm. This was in his denial that his work was in any way based
on the aid of the disembodied or spirit dead. He recognized no "guide"
or helper such as Spiritualistic mediums so often mention in their
psychic work. (In passing, it must be said that many such spirit helpers
have correctly diagnosed, prescribed and healed directly, even
instantly, but their number is painfully small, and the pretenders to
power are legion on the spirit levels.)

In the early years of Cayce's healing efforts the subject of
reincarnation was not mentioned, but, after he fell in with a gentleman
who believed in the Theosophical version of reincarnation, he began to
peer back into the past lives of his patients, often stating that
certain troubles were caused by one or more events in past lives. He
described these lives at times in some detail.

Since the work of Edgar Cayce has become widely known (through books
like Segrue's "There Is A River", and the excellent books on the
reincarnation

<span id="page_117">p. 117</span>

angles by Miss Gina Cerminara, as well as through publications issued by
The Association for Research and Enlightenment, headed by Mr. Hugh
Cayce) there have appeared individuals endeavoring to make "life
readings" similar to those made by Edgar Cayce. Usually, because of new
and stringent laws against psychic diagnosis and the prescription of
remedies, the work is confined to readings of past lives, and, because
such readings can seldom be checked, their accuracy is open to question.

The use of hypnotic suggestion is also coming rapidly under restrictive
laws, so, in the future it is probable that any person interested (as
many are) in trying their hands at contact and direct work with the High
Selves will have to use self-suggestion to reach the state needed for
contact and work. Given time and success on the part of those who
experiment, the medical world may eventually find in this corner of the
field things of great value which merit attention and use.

Perhaps the only precaution to be taken in testing out the use of
self-suggestion to try to duplicate the work of men like Cayce, is to
make doubly sure that contact is not made with the spirit of a dead man,
but with one's own High Self. Many spirits have, in the past, been
contacted, and a few have claimed to be the High Self of the
experimenter, but when they failed to show superior wisdom or power,
they were seen to be what they actually were, lying pretenders. A great
Huna initiate living in Judea long ago gave sage advice when he once
said, "By their fruits ye shall know them."
