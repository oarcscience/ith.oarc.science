The world faces its greatest famine. <span id="fr_0"></span>[\*](#fn_0.md)
Millions of people in Western Europe have already perished of hunger,
and millions more will experience a similar fate unless definite action
is taken soon. One would think that the countries which devastated their
lands would feel a moral obligation to remedy the situation; but such is
far from being the case. Some even contend that it is the duty of the
vanquished to feed the victors.

For centuries famine has stalked India and China while the rest of the
world lived in abundance. Slow mass starvation means nothing to the
well-fed and over-fed classes who glibly tell the Indians and Chinese
that they have only themselves to blame for their misery and hunger.
Others equally indifferent to the suffering and rights of others lay the
blame at the door of Nature.

<span id="page_104">p. 104</span>

However, it is not Nature but man who is responsible for the world's
misery and hunger, for whenever there is a scarcity in one part of the
world there is an over-abundance in another. The anomaly of want in the
midst of plenty is due to the fact that those who have the surplus
refuse to share it with the needy. There is no need for even one person
to perish from hunger, leave alone millions. If men would cease
violating the law of supply and demand, all people would have sufficient
and famine would be unknown.

Surely it is common sense and better for the. health of society for all
to have sufficient for their needs, than for the majority to lack and
the minority to have too much. A man who would permit a member of his
family to be hungry and in distress while he and the others were
well-fed and had a superfluity would be a monster. This is what ails the
social system. There are too many monsters whose greed reminds one of
hungry dogs who not only eat, their own portion, but devour the food on
the plates of others.

The existing social and economic order is about as healthful as a man
suffering from cancer. When one part of the body draws upon another, or
is opposed to the other, every species of evil, pain, wretchedness and
disorganization is generated. Cancer in man cannot be cured unless the
roots of the disease are completely extirpated, which usually means a
removal of a large portion of the unhealthy

<span id="page_105">p. 105</span>

tissue. No less drastic treatment will suffice for the cure of social
cancer.

Nothing is more hazardous than extirpating social cancer. Alleviating
the symptoms is applauded and approved; but woe unto him who would
remove its causes—as for example, war, crime and poverty. He is
ostracized, persecuted and often thrown in prison; for those entrenched
in economic power exhibit horror at any curative measures. But millions
of afflicted people, who possess nothing, and can only gain something,
welcome them.

Despite hostile opposition, progress is being made in the eradication of
social cancer and its deadly contributory roots. Social legislation is
being enacted compelling ruthless and greedy industrialists to do what
they should have done voluntarily long ago—namely, to provide for their
employees' unproductive years. Until recently they squeezed them dry and
then threw them on the social scrap-heap to starve, or to subsist on
charity. Now employers, much to their chagrin, must contribute towards
unemployment and Old Age Insurance. These are only first steps on the
road to a happy and healthy commonwealth, and incredibly naive are those
who think they can obstruct social progress.

There remain some conspicuous examples of social stiff-neckedness who
refuse to move with the changing order. Workers they regard as a
separate class of inferior animals who must be kept poor or else they
will cease to slave for the enrichment of their economic exploiters. But
if poverty is beneficial for

<span id="page_106">p. 106</span>

some it is beneficial for all, as all men are animated by the same
Spirit, and all tend towards the same goal.

Then too, the law of supply and demand is not generally understood. Most
people confound the channels with the source and assume that with the
loss of employment, securities or savings that the supply is diminished
or dissipated. There is, however, but one source of supply, and that is
God, and the Infinite can neither be increased nor decreased.

Some will surely object and ask: "If the supply cannot be lessened, what
happened to it during the depression when millions were unemployed,
hungry and in dire distress?" There was no lack of supply; but an
artificial condition of scarcity was created by designing and
unscrupulous men whose main interest was filling their purses. So they
deliberately clogged the channels of distribution and diverted to their
own use what rightfully belonged to others, thus creating economic
dislocations and social maladjustments. This monstrous situation,
coupled with the destruction of natural wealth; contempt of human
rights; and the removal of men from public office who would not conform,
were the order of the day and brought about the debacle.

Today an analogous condition exists, except that restriction has
replaced destruction in order to create the illusion of scarcity. While
the method is not so apparent, the result is equally effective—greater
profits for the few. Multitudes are allowed to go hungry so that a
minority may profit and become

<span id="page_107">p. 107</span>

wealthy. Even though half the world is hungry, in need of clothing and
shelter, restrictions prevail. The result is high prices which are the
motive.

A famous financial expert recently made an accurate diagnosis of our
monetary system. He said: "The present money system will work when we
reform our system of taxation. In this country we tax everything;
necessities, luxuries, amusements, transportation, and everyone who
works and earns more than a subsistence. We tax all but the man who has
a million dollars idle in the bank. Present system favors hoarding and
penalizes spending. Those who control investment funds say: 'We will
spend our money or not as we please. And we will invest only if we are
assured a satisfactory profit to ourselves, and not otherwise. Let the
people starve for all we care, or let the government feed, clothe and
house the idle and hungry.' Idle funds should be taxed, thus lightening
the burden of those who work and produce."

Many people assume that in order to get rich they must appropriate what
belongs to others. Such gains are always temporary, eventually
impoverishing the thief. Taking what belongs to others does not lessen
the total amount, we only make it less to those we rob. Whenever a man
accumulates and keeps for himself a hundred times more than he, needs,
he deprives at least a hundred people of the necessities of life. There
is nothing wrong about being a millionaire—if all could be millionaires.
Money in itself has no creative power; and when a

<span id="page_108">p. 108</span>

man lives off interest or dividends, he lives off the labor of his
fellowmen.

Maladjustments are further increased by the fact that as soon as there
is an increased demand for anything, the cost of the item increases in
proportion to its scarcity. People fear the supply will fail and they
create a false value by increasing their demands. This occurs because
people are governed by the law of self-interest and not the Golden Rule.

People fear the shortage of oil and rubber. But the supply will last as
long as the demand, when something else will appear, as it always has.
Unfortunately, new discoveries are often unwelcome and suppressed
because they will interfere with the profits of a current and often
inferior and outmoded article. It is common knowledge that large
corporations spend millions every year for the express purpose of
keeping inventions from the public.

The law of supply and demand, like all natural laws, is not concerned
with the worth of the individual; its only requirement is undeviating
obedience. Consequently, those who achieve the greatest benefits from
the law's application and manifest abundance, are those who harmonize
themselves with it. For example, the farmer who has the most extensive
knowledge of the laws of agriculture, and follows them implicitly, will
have an abundant harvest even though he may be a rogue or a reprobate.
On the other hand, the man who is ignorant of these laws, or fails to
comply with them, will have scant crops, regardless of worth or
character. Hence it

<span id="page_109">p. 109</span>

is not uncommon to see selfish and dishonest men have an over-abundance,
while the worthy, kind and devout often lack the necessities.

When in harmony with the law of supply and demand it is as easy to
manifest thousands as hundreds of dollars. The injury and injustice
arises not from the accumulation, but in the refusal to share it. All
the wealth of the world comes from the land and belongs to the Creator,
and is only loaned to man for 70 or 80 years at most. Whenever one has
more than he needs it should be distributed among those who are in need.
This is done by enlightened individuals.

When one takes without giving the law is violated; when service is
exchanged or an equivalent rendered, the law is fulfilled. A man who
breaks into another's house and robs him is a thief and punishable by
law. A man who appropriates from life what belongs to others is also a
thief and punishable by spiritual law. Whatever we take from life we are
obligated to pass on. Life flows through us, and whenever we attempt to
obstruct it trouble, illness, lack, failure and unhappiness follow. When
life flows unobstructedly through us, we are in harmony with it and we
are happy, healthy and successful.

A new social consciousness is needed—the realization of abundance for
all. This consciousness, however, will never be acquired collectively;
it is an individual process, each man linking himself with the Infinite
Source of supply and claiming his inalienable birthright to physical,
mental and spiritual

<span id="page_110">p. 110</span>

abundance. To go to the First Source of Supply—God—rather than to
earthly channels. The supply is Infinite, it is the demands that are
made upon it which are niggardly. When we shall have grasped this truth,
then the fear of poverty and scarcity will vanish.

Convincing an impoverished man of unlimited supply is difficult; but
because he does not understand the law does not alter it. If a man does
not know the law of mathematics he will get wrong answers to his
problems. The same is true with the law of supply and demand. That the
supply is always equal to the demand was demonstrated by some people
even during the depths of the depression; they had ample while around
them were others who lacked the necessities.

A poverty consciousness staves off supply. Men. think they are poor and
fear poverty, and because they think and fear it, they are. When we
doubt we limit our supply, but we do not make the supply any less; we
merely lessen it to ourselves. Lack of faith clogs the channels, while
faith keeps them wide open. For instance, a man with faith who loses one
position soon obtains another.

Many erroneously suppose that getting enriches, and that giving
impoverishes. It is the reverse which is true. What you keep you lose,
and what you give is yours forever. For man owns nothing in its
entirety; if he did it would be his beyond all question; none could take
it from him, or destroy it, and upon his demise could take it with him.

<span id="page_111">p. 111</span>

Life abundant is all around us and yet some live like misers who have
fortunes concealed in their rags. How often one reads of beggars who
drop dead in the street and police find thousands of dollars stuffed in
their pockets or in banks. In order to accumulate this wealth they
subsisted on meager rations and lived in sordid surroundings. We wonder
at these wealthy paupers who lived in deprivation to hoard money. Yet
how many more live in abject intellectual poverty while all around them
are mental riches? Moreover, these are available to all for none can
hinder another from contacting the Universal Mind and acquiring all the
knowledge he desires. Nor does he have the keen, merciless competition
to contend with, as he does on the material plane.

Plato, Socrates and Aristotle possessed the greatest of mental riches
while all around them were hoards of impoverished intellects. Today, as
then, most people are content to reflect the opinions of others instead
of being original. Yet we contribute and enrich the world and ourselves
only by that which we have extracted from the Universal Mind and
individualized into a thought or an idea.

To see physical life undermined by hunger is pitiful; to see
intellectual life enfeebled is tragic; but to see spiritual life starved
is calamitous. Yet everywhere there are spiritual mendicants living in
abject poverty, enveloped in materiality. Blindly they pursue material
things and ignore the immortal truths which heal, soothe, enlighten and
bless, and which,

<span id="page_112">p. 112</span>

like flowers, are scattered at their feet. The wisdom of the
philosophers, seers and saints has been preserved and are easily
available to all who can read. But how few partake of them?

Lastly, it is only the intellectual and spiritual. things that man can
rightly call his own. All material things, whether he earned them, or
whether he bought them, or whether they were gifts, must be left at the
threshold of death. Therefore it is a great mistake to live poor in
order to die rich, for no dead man is rich save in good works.

"To live rich and not die rich, should be the aim of life; for it is
good works and not goods that will follow us."
