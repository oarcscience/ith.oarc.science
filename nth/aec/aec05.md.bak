Human nature is the basis of character, the temperament and disposition;
it is that indestructible matrix upon which the character is built, and
whose shape it must take and keep throughout life. This we call a
person's nature.

The basic nature of human beings does not and cannot change. It is only
the surface that is capable of alteration, improvement and refinement;
we can alter only people's customs, manners, dress and habits. A study
of history reveals that the people who walked this earth in antiquity
were moved by the same fundamental forces, were swayed by the same
passions, and had the same aspirations as the men and women of today.
The pursuit of happiness still engrosses mankind the world over.

Moreover no one wishes his nature to change. One may covet the position
of President or King, but would not change places with them unless it

<span id="page_20">p. 20</span>

meant the continuance of his own identity. Each man sees himself as
unique, and so far as he is concerned, the hub of the universe,
different from any other individual. Apologies are in order when Mr.
Smith is mistaken for Mr. Jones.

Although human nature resists all efforts at alteration, there are some
people who never weary of trying to make others over, usually into a
replica of themselves. Public reformers, for example, who would dare
tell God how the race could be improved. They consider themselves the
model for all mankind, and strive to make others conform to their own
image and likeness, as they are confident that such similarity will
bring about the millennium.

Then there are the wives who cherish the fond delusion that husbands are
capable of reform, and vice versa; and mothers who endeavor to mould
their children into an ideal of their own. Failing in their ambitious
attempts to remodel others, these people will admit: "You cannot change
people."

Why should anyone wish to change another's nature? What makes some
people believe that they can improve the Creator's work? If human nature
were the work of man it would require a great deal of rectification. But
since it is created by God, we can be assured that it is potentially
God-like. In fact, human nature and Divine Nature are
[analogous](errata.htm#1.md). This is certain, if man had the power to
change the nature of any species it would become either a hybrid, a
freak or a monstrosity.

<span id="page_21">p. 21</span>

For whenever man tampers with nature he only succeeds in defiling it,
for deterioration follows such violation.

Not even education is able to change human nature, although many people
labor under this delusion. Many parents expect education to make a dull
child bright. Children can only be trained and guided along the lines of
their inherent capabilities, they cannot depart from nature's pattern. A
moron is one, not for lack of education, but because his intelligence is
incapable of normal training. Learning, instead of overcoming mental
disability, tends only to expose it. Not even Jesus, the greatest of
teachers, was able to change the nature of his disciples, who to the
very end retained their original character, and manifested their
original tendencies.

For centuries we have had dinned in our ears that "man is a miserable
sinner," "a frail mortal prone to error and sin," "a weakling whose
nature is corrupt and base." These disparaging assertions originate in
the fallacious theory that man is a product of matter. Human nature is
God Nature; and as such it needs to be respected, for never before has
its original Divinity been so doubted and its dignity so debased.

Since human nature resists all efforts at modification and alteration,
it is useless to legislate toward uniformity—to require men to be what
they are not. Laws which depend upon compulsion instead of persuasion or
education never work. Those

<span id="page_22">p. 22</span>

which aim at regimentation likewise miscarry. Human differences,
dissimilar capacities, ideas and talents must be recognized. The most
successful governments are those which permit and encourage men to
develop their basic differences.

Human beings were created unlike, and the more they unfold the more will
they differ. Their innate unlikeness cannot be eradicated, but it can
and should be developed. Compulsory conformity in all respects is
contrary to man's nature, and induces him to break those laws that
restrict his freedom of expression and action. The masses must some day
awaken from their stupor and begin to think. Thought is of course about
the last thing rulers encourage; their ambition is to eliminate it
altogether.

Every man unfolds a distinct character over which circumstances and
education have only the most limited control. No two people will ever
draw the same conclusions from the same experiences, but each must
interpret events and fit them into the mosaic of his own life's pattern.
Human nature is ever true to itself, not to systems of faith or
education. Each holds to the structure of the mould into which the soul
was cast at the time of its individualization. The qualities born in one
remain as potentials whether they have a chance to develop or not. Under
pressure, or change of interest, they can partially or wholly disappear
from view for considerable periods of

<span id="page_23">p. 23</span>

time; but nothing can permanently modify them, nothing can obliterate
them.

The constancy of human nature is proverbial, as no one believes that a
man can fundamentally change his nature. This is why it is so difficult
for one who has acquired an unsavory reputation to re-establish himself
in public confidence. People know from experience that an individual who
in one year displays knavish characteristics seldom in the next becomes
any different. Nor does a thief become a trustworthy employee, or a
miser a philanthropist. Nor does a man change and become a liar, coward
or traitor at fifty or sixty; if he is one then, he has been one ever
since his character was formed. Big criminals are first little
criminals, just as giant oaks are first little acorns.

Although man is potentially perfect he is far from being actually so. If
he were actually perfect there would be nothing for preachers, teachers
and humanitarians to do; no use for churches, schools, courts and
prisons. Therefore while it is impossible to change human nature, it can
be studied, controlled and directed, and this should be the supreme
function of our religious, educational and social institutions.

Man is perfect as a seed is perfect, germinally. The spirit is perfect,
but when it inhabits human structures, it participates in the
imperfections of the latter; and during its association with matter
takes on the mortal weaknesses, desires and limitations. But the spirit,
the inner man, remains untouched

<span id="page_24">p. 24</span>

and undefiled by evil. Only the outer man,—the personality and the
physical body—becomes imperfect, due to ignorance, wrong thinking and
violation of the laws of being. The outer man, too, was originally
perfect, but man has so desecrated and abused it that today it is a far
cry from the original model.

Man's majesty and nobility are taken for granted, although his faults
and weaknesses are constantly paraded before our eyes. Only when
behavior deviates from the normal does it attract attention. The good
neighbor, the conscientious citizen, the kind father and faithful
husband pass unnoticed. But the murderer, robber or wife beater is
singled out for publicity, because such conduct is unusual.

Man's inherent goodness, moreover, is revealed by his countless acts of
heroism, unselfishness and sacrifice. Daily one reads of men saving
others at the peril of their own lives. One plunges into the surf and
rescues a swimmer from drowning; another dashes into a burning house and
carries a stranger to safety; others snatch a child from the wheels of
death; many give their blood that others may live. Not only the Nazarene
but countless unnamed and unrecorded men have given their lives for
their fellowmen, not only on the battlefront but on the home-front as
well.

We care not how outwardly base and cruel a man may appear to be, there
is a vulnerable spot within every man. There is a spark of Divinity
which must be appealed to,

<span id="page_25">p. 25</span>

Some will deny man's Divinity, especially in times of war. True, today
many men have reverted to a stage lower than savage, but this is the
result of coercion. They would have shunned such action if left to
themselves. "Whenever stupid rulers disagree, they commit conspiracies
against mankind and cunningly incite them to murder one another," is as
true today as in the time of Carlyle, the author of this statement. If
people had access to the truth, wars would be impossible; but truth will
never be available so long as governments control the news and its
sources. The tragedy of it! Men are capable of so much heroism,
nobility, generosity and kindness. But leaders who should encourage this
conduct, incite them to fly at each other's throats like mad dogs.

The reports of psychiatrists prove that murder is a violation of human
nature. During World War I, one-third of all casualties were mental
disorders. Thirty-four thousand mentally disabled veterans from previous
wars are still in government hospitals, costing to date more than a
billion dollars. It is still too soon to count the victims of the recent
slaughter, but the number will far exceed those of previous wars.

Now another carnival of carnage is halted, the last shot is fired for
some people. But the war is not over for these hundreds of thousands of
insane and shell-shocked victims who are still in their world of hell,
secluded from the public, forgotten

<span id="page_26">p. 26</span>

and neglected by the politicians and the war-for-profit patrioteers.

Human nature does not and cannot change but unfolds its inherent pattern
on the loom of Eternal Time. All created things fulfill their destiny
and the purpose for which they were created. We may not understand why
God made man as He has; we can only endeavor to understand man as he is.
He has a nature and its laws can be known. It was not said of man, "thus
far shalt thou go, and no farther." He was made to advance; the power to
do so distinguishes him from the animal. A true knowledge of God is
universally written in man's nature; and every effort to know more,
every aspiration, looks toward the achievement of this knowledge.
