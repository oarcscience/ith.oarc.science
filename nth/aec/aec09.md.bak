Love is the highest vibration of all, and covers all our relations with
our fellowmen. Love is the most important law in the universe, and he
who is in harmony with this law will be in harmony with all of the
others. It is the transgression of the law of love which causes all
evil.

Love is the great force to which all men are subject, and is more vital
and powerful than electricity. Love is the life of man, for without
love, life is mere existence. Every soul, without exception, craves love
and affection and atrophies for lack of it. To love and to be loved
makes life worthwhile.

Love is the essence of Divine Nature, and since love is the nature of
God, it must be the nature of man in a correspondingly lesser degree,
for man is created in His image.

Human love, which is a reflection of Divine Love passes through three
stages. The first stage is selfish;

<span id="page_62">p. 62</span>

only the "I" is considered; one's own satisfaction, pleasures, desires
and comfort. It is the taking, not the giving stage; an elementary
expression of love, much too common.

The second stage of love is mutual, give and take, or sharing of love.
Each lover considers the other's happiness, wishes and welfare. This
type of love is a much higher manifestation than the first and becomes
more prevalent as man develops.

The third stage of love is selfless; it asks nothing in return. The only
desire of this type of love is to serve and to worship the adored one.
Needless to say few have reached this high plane of selfless, spiritual
love.

Since love is manifested chiefly in the first stage, one sees a constant
misuse of the term. It is employed by many people to designate a liking
for articles, a fondness for foods and drinks, an attachment for places
and things. Love, however, in its highest sense can only be properly
used to denote affection between individuals. Love expresses something
spiritual, and as such can have no connection with objects that minister
solely to the senses.

The word love should never be employed to express animal passion, desire
or appetite, for it has no relationship to these. Nor is it applicable
to the affairs of sensual and licentious men and women which hold the
daily front page with lewd and unsavory details. Such people understand
neither love nor marriage; they know only lust and mating.

<span id="page_63">p. 63</span>

Worse still, are the periodicals which use love as a euphemism for lust,
telling us that murder and heinous crimes are committed for "love."
There are no crimes of love but only crimes of lust. The demons of lust
and murder are twin brothers and follow in each other's tracks.

Nor is progressive polygamy to be confounded with the pure and permanent
tie of holy matrimony. People do not marry for practical considerations
such as money, security, in order to advance their social or material
opportunities. Those who do so, sell themselves. Love is based on mutual
respect and consideration, without which a relationship is mere
possessiveness, not to be mentioned in the same breath as love.

Jealousy is no ingredient of love although many assume it is. Jealousy
emanates from self-love only. One who truly loves has no thought of
rewards; the only desire is the happiness of the beloved. Happiness is
rarely possible with a selfish or jealous individual. Almost any vices
are preferable to these, and most others are more easily overcome.

Love is an intense and absorbing emotion. It draws one toward a
particular person and causes one to appreciate and delight in that
person, and to crave the presence of the beloved. There is a desire to
please and to benefit the beloved, and to advance his happiness and
welfare. If we love we must give.

"How can I know if it is really love," the young and many no longer
young, often ask. They have been mistaken before and now wish to be
certain

<span id="page_64">p. 64</span>

that this time it is love, and not temporary infatuation or merely
physical attraction. There is one sure test. How much will you give of
yourself, and he or she for you? Love never counts the cost. Many
Anthonys and Cleopatras have considered the world well lost for love.

Many people are so niggardly with their affections and then complain
that they are not loved. Whose is the fault? The unloved and unloving
individual. Love begets love, and love attracts love. Love is the
mainspring of life and he who loves the most lives the most. This is
certain; humanity has no love for people who have no love for them.

There is, however, nothing possible to do if one's love is not
reciprocated. It is utterly impossible to compel love. Resorting to
vicarious means,—charms, trickery or sensual appeal accomplishes naught.
Artificial tricks may produce temporary passional attraction, but not
permanent sentiment.

If our love is unrequited, are we any poorer for having loved? Quite the
contrary, for loving enriches and does not impoverish us. As the old
friar told Evangeline when she told him of her wasted affection:

"Talk not of wasted affection, affection never was wasted;  
 If it enrich not the heart of another, its waters returning  
 Back to their springs, like the rain,  
 shall fill them full of refreshment; <span id="page_65">p. 65</span>  
 That which the fountain sends forth returns again to the fountain."

Love's supply is inexhaustible and one can never become bankrupt by
loving. Parents with one child feel confident they have lavished all
their love upon it; but when they have others, they discover they are
capable of loving them all equally as much.

"Love your enemies" is the soundest advice ever given to man, yet of the
Master's injunctions this one seems the most difficult to obey. But what
other solution have we to overcome the enemy? With force or revenge one
places himself on a level with his opponent. For the time being you are
no better than he, however much he may be guilty and you the innocent
party. Moreover hate intensifies the vibration while love nullifies it.

When you hate a man you are bound to him with bonds stronger than steel.
Consequently nothing is so foolish as to hate another, for the hater is
getting the worst of it. So, if only for your own peace of mind love
your enemies; in no other way can you ever be free from them.

Loving people does not mean that you must love all persons to the same
degree. Even Jesus had his favorite disciple, the one he preferred above
all. But loving does mean that we can be kind, understanding and
sympathetic, and love people in a Platonic sense, which is a beautiful
manifestation of spirit. Moreover, it is easy to love the good or God
which is in all men.

<span id="page_66">p. 66</span>

"Love is blind," that is what is claimed in an old proverb. Is it true
that one who loves is incapable of seeing defects and faults in a
beloved, which are apparent to friends and relatives? Love is not blind;
love is the clarifier. No one is so blind as one who hates; one who can
see only people's faults and weaknesses. Moreover, love stimulates the
development of latent capacities for good, and one becomes better and
nobler for having truly loved, or having been the recipient of an
unselfish and pure affection.

Why do we love certain people? For their admirable traits, excellencies
of character, or sterling values? Often the opposite is true. We love
them despite their shortcomings and defects. We love them for some
characteristic, or peculiarity, for their wit, or perhaps charm,
friendly manner or kind heart. In other words we love people for
themselves; because they are as they are, and we would not change them
if we could.

One can never give a logical reason for love; when love ascends the
throne reason abdicates. Intelligent people just as often as the
unintelligent place their affections unwisely. And there is no greater
agony than to love someone with all your heart, someone you know to be
unworthy, and yet be helpless to free yourself. Time alleviates but
never obliterates the scars of such emotional suffering; never do we
forget those who have made us suffer.

<span id="page_67">p. 67</span>

Love's power accounts for many peculiar relationships. One sees
individuals cling to those who no longer love them, frequently even to
those who abuse them. If love were under the control of the will such
unions would be speedily terminated; but, alas, they cannot for the time
being sever their emotional bonds.

Often married people seem mismated; they differ in temperament,
education, tastes, ideas and ideals, and yet despite these apparently
irreconcilable characteristics they achieve a plausible harmony. While
such people may have many interests and ideas not mutually shared, they
do have in common at least one point of interest; it may be only an
instinctive attraction, but it is sufficiently powerful to keep them
together.

Look around and try to explain to yourself how certain individuals ever
found a mate. You wonder how anyone ever came to marry such an
unattractive and peculiar person. It seems strange to us who do not love
them; but not to the lover, whose life would be devastated with the loss
of his partner.

Nature always has her ultimate purposes, with no regard or consideration
for the suffering involved to the individual. Nature is never interested
in individuals, only in people collectively.

Love, like God, is no respecter of persons or with the worth of an
individual. Hence it is not uncommon to see unworthy people the
recipient of deep affection. This is not because the loved one is worthy
or capable of inspiring so much devotion;

<span id="page_68">p. 68</span>

but it is due to the great capacity of the other to love. That is the
secret of all great loves—the capacity to love, and not the worth of the
recipient.

Love is the theme for all great music, literature, sculpture and
painting. Love inspired the conception and construction of the world's
most beautiful building—the Taj Mahal. Everyone who has seen it has
marvelled at its sublime beauty; has felt it to be different, apart from
all others in the world. True, it was built for a mausoleum, but it is
not death one thinks of when contemplating its beauty. One thinks of
deathless love and eternal marriage.

"What therefore God hath joined together, let no man put asunder," has
been interpreted by some theologians that man has the power to undo the
work of God. Divorce is man-made and puts asunder only carnal marriages.
"What God hath joined together" NO MAN can separate. Man can only put
asunder what he or the flesh hath joined together. What God or love hath
joined together are forever one. Divorce separates only those who are
physically mated, never those who are spiritually married, for the twain
are one. Surface marriages are as naught compared to the holy tie of
spiritual matrimony.

True marriage, or soul affinity, is the realization that man and woman
have no actual existence apart from each other; that they are, in fact,
counterparts, without which their separate lives are imperfect and
unformed. Neither man nor woman can enjoy anything alone; they need
their other half

<span id="page_69">p. 69</span>

to share their joys and sorrows and make their life complete.

Life is dual, and love, true soul-love, is the bond of union which
reunites the severed parts. The bond exists independent of personal
charms or mental endowments. It annihilates self and selfishness;
prefers the beloved beyond all else; survives through sickness and
health; through good or evil report; lives for the one beloved, dies and
realizes heaven only in the union which death may interrupt but cannot
sever. Divine spiritual affinity survives death and the grave, unites
the two, and in eternity perfects the dual nature of man and woman,
companions for eternity.

Lives are made or broken by marriage; lives are permanently altered by
marriage whether the union be temporary or permanent. When marriage is
entered lightly and severed carelessly, usually both parties are deeply
wounded and lose some of their idealism through this experience. Neither
emerges from the situation as they entered it. And their affection
instead of being a living and beautiful thing becomes ashes, and bitter
ones at that. Often people value material possessions more than love and
affection. They guard and insure them against accident, fire, loss and
theft; on the other hand they let their marriage die for lack of love
and understanding.

Some erroneously regard marriage as synonymous with bondage, and assume
that their liberty is relinquished with marriage. There never was a

<span id="page_70">p. 70</span>

greater mistake. In true marriage both parties have more freedom than
out of it. Married, many people rise to heights they never would have
attained if single. One marital authority truly says: "There's nothing
you can do outside of marriage that you 'can't do in marriage—and do a
lot better."

Everything in life has its price and love is no exception. But unlike
most other things love is always worth the cost—which is pain. Love and
pain are inseparable; one cannot be had without the other, for
eventually death will impose a temporary separation. If, however, one
realizes that the separation is only temporary, it will ease the agony
of parting and enable one to bear the loneliness and to look forward
with absolute certainty to reunion.

"Shall we meet those we love when we die?" Most assuredly we shall. All
those we loved on earth we shall see again. Where there is love there is
no death, for love is of the Deity. No way has ever been found to kill
real love; that which perishes is not love but a counterfeit. If you
have ever loved anyone, loved their very soul, you have never ceased to
love them. Love is like the soul, it is eternal and does not experience
death.
