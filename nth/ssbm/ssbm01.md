|                                    |     | Huna is a workable system of magic. Religious beliefs have nothing to do with workability of Huna. Proof that magic is a fact: Case 1. Dr. Brigham walks on red-hot lava. Case 2. Stage magician used genuine magic. Case 3. Dr. John H. Hill, Prof. of Biblical History of U.S.C. reports fire-walking. Case 4. Fire-walking in Burma. Case 5. Fire-walking of the Igorots. Case 6. Japanese fire magic cures arthritis. Fire immunity through magic.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |     |                                 |
