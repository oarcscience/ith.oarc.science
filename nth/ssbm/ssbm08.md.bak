### CHAPTER VII

### PSYCHOMETRY, CRYSTAL GAZING, VISIONS OF THE PAST, VISIONS OF THE FUTURE, ETC., EXPLAINED BY THE ANCIENT LORE OF THE KAHUNAS

Telepathy is the sending of messages (as thought forms) along the
connecting cords of invisible shadowy body substance which connect one
person with another. The messages are sent by the subconscious self and
received by it, to be given to the conscious self in due time.

Psychometry, and its related phenomena, depend on the same mechanisms
except that the shadowy cord or thread does not connect two similar
persons. A psychometrist usually sits quietly and touches a letter, a
ring or some object about which he wishes to get psychic information,
such as the past of the object held, or the contents of a letter and the
nature and surroundings of its writer.

The fact which I wish to stress is that one practicing this form of
magic reaches out along the shadowy threads which are attached to an
object, following them to their ends, and finding there the things and
people formerly associated with the object. Or, if the object is a stone
such as has fallen in a meteorite, the thread will lead only to the
source of the stone—the meteorite.

#### <span class="smallcaps">Psychometry, Crystal Gazing and Related Phenomena</span>

*Preliminary Notes:* None

*The Cases:*

\(A\) A piece of lava was psychometrized by Mrs. Cridge, and the
impression she received of the volcano was so vivid and frightening that
she was seized with a feeling of terror that lasted for over an hour.

\(B\) Mrs. Denton psychometrized a fragment of mastodon tooth and
described the sensations which resulted: "I feel like a perfect monster,
with heavy legs, unwieldy head, and very large body. I go down to a
shallow stream to drink. I can hardly speak, my jaws are so heavy. I
feel like getting down on all fours. What a noise comes through the
wood. I have an impulse to answer it. My ears are very large and
leathery, and I can almost fancy they flap my face as I move my head.
There are some older ones than I.… They are dark brown, as if they had
been completely tanned. There is one old fellow, with large tusks, that
looks very tough. I see several younger ones; in fact, there is a whole
herd."

Note: Ossowiecki, one of the foremost psychometrists of our time, gives
an excellent description of his sensations during the practice of this
form of magic:

"I begin by stopping all reasoning, and I throw all my inner power into
perception of spiritual sensation. I affirm that this condition is
brought about by my unshakable faith in the spiritual unity of all
humanity.

<span id="page_133">p. 133</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> I then find myself
in a new and special state in which I see and hear outside time and
space.… Whether I am reading a sealed letter, or finding a lost object,
or psychometrizing, the sensations are nearly the same. I seem to lose
some energy; my temperature becomes febrile, and the heartbeats unequal.
I am confirmed in this supposition because, as soon as I cease from
reasoning, something like electricity flows through my extremities for a
few seconds. This lasts a moment only, and then lucidity takes
possession of me, pictures arise, usually from the past. I see the man
who wrote the letter and I know what he wrote. I see the object at the
moment of its loss, with details of the event; or again I perceive or
feel the history of the thing I am holding in my hands. The vision is
misty and needs great tension. Considerable effort is required to
perceive some details and conditions of the scenes presented. The lucid
state sometimes arises in a few minutes, and sometimes it takes hours of
waiting. This largely depends on the surroundings; scepticism,
incredulity, or even attention, too much concentrated on my person,
paralyzes quick success in reading or sensations."

There are various phases to psychometry. Some do their best work when
hypnotized before various objects are handed them to be psychometrized.
Some see into the distant past, sensing the ancient surroundings of an
object. Some follow psychically the deceased into the "beyond" and see
their present condition and actions as disembodied spirits. Some, and
these instances are rare, even see the future events which will be
associated with the object which is held in their hands.

In just over a century of Psychical Research and of

<span id="page_134">p. 134</span>

effort to explain how psychometry is accomplished, several theories have
been advanced. Dr. Pagenstecher offered the following:

"The associated object which practically witnessed certain events of the
past, acting in the way of a tuning fork, automatically starts in our
brain the specific vibrations corresponding to the said events;
furthermore, the vibrations of our brain once being set in tune with
certain parts of the Cosmic Brain already stricken by the same events,
call forth sympathetic vibrations between the human brain and the Cosmic
Brain, giving birth to thought pictures which reproduce the events in
question."

Sir Arthur Conan Doyle offered the explanation that all events and
circumstances impressed themselves on some form of invisible and
permanent, unchangeable ether. This imprinted ether, he supposed, was
read by psychic vision by the psychometrist when attention was centered
on a part of the ether connected with the object held in the hands.

Theosophists, building on ideas found in India, propound (see the works
of Blavatsky) the theory that there is a World-Soul or Akasa, upon whose
memory is impressed all that happens. Psychometry, under this theory,
becomes more definitely mechanical. One uses the object held in the
hands to make a psychic connection with the part of the memory of the
World-Soul having to do with the object's past. By a form of psychic
telepathy, or—better yet—mind reading, the psychometrist "reads the
Akashic Records."

Another angle of the problem of psychometry is to be found in visions of
a psychometric nature which occur

<span id="page_135">p. 135</span>

in the vicinity of past battles or other less exciting events. These
visions appear to a number of persons gathered on the scene, and all
agree as to what they see—however, there are usually present people who
see not a thing. Dr. Nandor Fodor gives some of the instances which have
been recorded and which are widely accepted as true. The following case
is one of them:

\(C\) "The Battle of Edge Hill … was fought on October 22, 1624. Two
months later a number of shepherds and village people witnessed an
aerial reenactment of the battle with all the noises of the guns, the
neighing of the horses and the groans of the wounded. The vision lasted
for hours, and was witnessed by people of reputation for several
consecutive days and when its rumor reached the ears of Charles I., a
commission (sent out to investigate) not only reported to have seen the
vision, on two occasions, but actually recognized fallen friends of
theirs among the fighters, among others Sir Edmund Varney."

Dr. Fodor also calls attention to a well-verified case of Psychometric
Premonition experienced by Count Buerger Moerner in recent times, and
described in a German psychological periodical in 1931:

\(D\) "Passing through the little garden and glancing in at the window
as he approached the house … the Count was horrified to see the body of
an old woman hanging from a ceiling beam… but once across the threshold
was stunned with amazement to find the old woman rising startled from
her chair, demanding the reason for his surprising intrusion.… Some days
later … he decided to visit the hut once more,

<span id="page_136">p. 136</span>

curious to see if by some peculiarity of the windowpane he might not
have been observing an optical illusion. Nearing the hut … as before,
the same terrible sight met his eye. This time, however … he entered to
find what he saw this time was no vision. The old woman's body was
indeed hanging from the beam. She had committed suicide."

 

Crystal gazing is akin to psychometry with the difference that instead
of an object to hold in the hands, the thought of a certain person may
be held in mind while gazing into the crystal in expectation of seeing a
vision form in its depths. This form of psychometry, while not generally
recognized as such, is not to be overlooked in a study of the problem.

*Comment:*

To make the matter of this particular magical practice all inclusive,
one has but to include dreams in which the future is seen. Here we have
not even a thought to be held in mind (as in crystal gazing) to form the
seed of the psychometric action.

In the premonitory dream the same elements are contained as in the other
examples which have been given. (1) Evidence of an impress on some
intangible medium capable of recording impressions of events. (2)
Evidence of some form of consciousness or intelligence which directs
this recording process. (2A) Evidence—in the case of events recorded on
such a medium before they occur—that this Intelligence has some form of
mentation superior to ours in so far as it enables it to see into the
future, to say nothing of the past or of the happenings of the moment at
distant places. (3) Evidence

<span id="page_137">p. 137</span>

of some mechanism by which the psychometrist, the crystal gazer, or the
dreamer of premonitory dreams comes into contact with the postulated
recording substance, or reads a postulated memory and pre-memory in the
mind of the postulated Intelligence. (4) Evidence that this connection
is of a telepathic nature, or is related to clairvoyance and mind
reading. (5) Evidence—because the psychometrist cannot command the
visions but must wait until they rise before his consciousness—that the
subconscious is the one who does this mysterious work of making
telepathic contact, not the conscious.

I have, in order to pull together the scattered and seemingly unrelated
phenomena just discussed, made several points in such rapid order that
the report may seem confusing at this place. However, the reader will
now have a general picture of the ancient magic of the kahunas, and if
it can be kept in mind that there are three sets of three things, and a
physical body, as I list them below for ease in checking back, the
picture will grow clearer as the several phenomena related to
psychometry are taken up in cases and examined in detail.

#### <span class="smallcaps">The Ten Elements in Kahuna Magic or Psychology</span>

I. Three spirits which compose the man (living or deceased).

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

A. The subconscious. Remembers but has defective reason. Creates all
emotions.

B. The conscious. Cannot remember but has full reasoning power.

C. The superconscious. It has a form of mentation by which it knows by a
process of "realizing." It knows the past, the present and as much of
the future as has been crystallized or definitely planned, created or
projected on its level.

</div>

<span id="page_138">p. 138</span>

II\. The three voltages of vital force (*mana*) used by the three
spirits of man.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

A. The body waves or low voltage vital electrical force. It is used by
the subconscious and can flow over threads of shadowy body substance
(*aka*. Similar to "astral cords"). It can carry chemical substances
with it as it flows from person to person. It can take the form of
magnetism and can be stored in wood and other porous substances. A large
discharge of this low voltage vital force, commanded by the "will" can
exert a paralyzing effect, or a mesmeric effect resulting in
unconsciousness, sleep and the rigid or cataleptic state.

B. The brain waves or vital force of the next higher voltage, used by
the conscious mind spirit in us in all its thinking and "willing"
activities. Used as will, it can be mesmeric or hypnotic force, provided
that a thought form is introduced into the mind of the subject. It
cannot travel over the shadowy substance threads, as can the lower
voltage. (Or at least it seems not to do so.)

C. The high voltage of vital force (not discovered by science as yet),
that thought by the kahunas to be used by the superconscious for its
various purposes. It is of the atom-smashing voltage of electrical
energy, in all probability.

</div>

III\. The invisible or shadowy substance (etheric or astral) bodies in
which the three spirits composing man reside. The lower two usually
interblend with each other and with the body, during life. They remain
interblended after death unless separated by some unfortunate
circumstance.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

A. The shadowy body of the subconscious. It is the most dense of the
three. It is of such a nature that it sticks to whatever we touch (or
perhaps see or hear), and when removed from the contact, draws out a
long invisible thread of itself which connects one with the thing
contacted, in a form of semi-permanent union. (It is not known how
permanent this thread or the main body itself may be, but it seems to
survive far longer than dense physical substances.) All things were
supposed by the kahunas to have a shadowy body, be they crystals,
plants, animals, fabricated articles, men or gods—even thoughts (the
latter being very important to the magical system and its practices).
This substance is an ideal conductor of vital

</div>

<span id="page_139">p. 139</span>

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

electrical force or currents, and can be used as a storage place for it.
When heavily charged with the low voltage of the force it becomes rigid
and firm enough to be used as a "hand" or instrument to move or affect
physical objects—as in table tipping, etc.

B. The shadowy body of the conscious mind spirit of man is less dense
than that of the subconscious. It seems not to be sticky or to pull out
into threads. It may or may not be a conductor of low voltage vital
force, but undoubtedly is a conductor of the middle voltage—its own
peculiar voltage as used in its form of mentation and "will." It forms
the ghostly body in which the spirit functions as a spirit after death.

C. The shadowy body of the superconscious spirit of man. The
superconscious is supposed to reside in this invisible and very light
body at all times, seldom making direct contact with the physical body
by entering it. By analogy, it is supposed to have characteristics
somewhat resembling the shadowy bodies of the two lower spirits.

</div>

The use of terms familiar to us through modern Psychology is difficult,
and a simpler set of terms, patterned after the terminology of the
kahunas, will be handier. Below I give the simpler terms (near the above
check list of the ten elements, for convenience in referring to them):

#### <span class="smallcaps">Simplified Terms for the Ten Elements in the Ancient Psychological System</span>

I. Low spirit or low self: the subconscious. A separate spirit.

II\. Low *mana* or low voltage of vital force. Used by the low spirit.

III\. Low *aka* or low shadowy body (low astral or etheric double) of
the low self.

IV\. Middle spirit or self: the conscious mind, spirit or entity. It is
a separate spirit and not a permanent part of the low self.

V. Middle *mana* or middle voltage of vital force. Used only by the
middle spirit.

<span id="page_140">p. 140</span>

VI\. The middle *aka* or middle shadowy body, inhabited by the middle
spirit.

VII\. The High Self or Spirit: the superconscious. A separate spirit or
self connected distantly with the low and middle selves, and acting as
an "over-self," or parental guardian spirit.

VIII\. The High *Aka* or high shadowy body of the High Self, in which it
lives.

IX\. The High *Mana* or high voltage of vital force, used by the High
Self or High Spirit.

X. The body: the physical body which is entered by the low and middle
spirits or selves in their *aka* bodies and used by them during life.
The High Self is distantly connected to the physical body, probably, for
the most part, by *aka* threads issued by the low self from its shadowy
body.

The corresponding terms in Hawaiian are listed below for convenient
checking:

I. Low self: *unihipili*.

II\. Low vital force: *mana*.

III\. Low shadowy body: *kino aka*.

IV\. Middle self or spirit: *uhane*.

V. Middle voltage of vital force: *mana-mana* (a symbol, meaning "to
spread out as a vine"). (Doubling the root often indicates an increase
in the strength of the meaning.)

VI\. Middle shadowy body: *kino aka*. (No differentiation of term.)

VII\. High Self or Spirit: *Aumakua* (meaning older, parental and
perfectly trustworthy spirit). There are a number of other names also
used to indicate the High Self in its various activities, and it is
obvious that the kahunas paid it much attention.

VIII\. High voltage of vital force: *mana-loa* (meaning strongest or
greatest force). The symbol of the High Self was the sun, and its force
was symbolized by the light.

IX\. High shadow body: *kino aka*, with no differentiation of the term
as applied to the two lower spirits, although there seems to have been
some use of symbolic terms to indicate it. The Berber kahuna thought its
symbol was the moon.

X. The physical body: *kino*.
