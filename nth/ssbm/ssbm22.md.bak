### CHAPTER XXI

### HOW THE KAHUNAS CONTROLLED WINDS, WEATHER AND THE SHARKS BY MAGIC

Hawaiian legendary history tells the story of how the ancestors of the
Hawaiians traveled from the original homeland in great double canoes
which were driven through the water by the power of magic.

This was the same magic which had enabled the leader, Hawaii Loa, to see
half way around the globe and find the island group which was to be
their new home. With this same magic the winds and waves were controlled
so that the frail crafts of the migratory fleet were not lost.

Still another use for this form of magic lay in the control exerted over
sharks and other creatures of the sea.

This work was based on the theory that when the middle self graduates to
become a High Self, it serves an apprenticeship acting as a guardian (or
as called in Theosophy a "nature spirit") over massive parts of the
lower creation. These spirits are the seat of higher consciousness which
can be seen at work in crystals, plants, insects, birds, fish and
animals. They are the source of the instinctive knowledge which enables
the bee to build its honey cell and the bird its intricate nest.

As all High Selves are closely in touch, an appeal for weather control
can be made through one's own High Self, who, supposedly, passes it on
to the High Self in charge of weather in that vicinity.

<span id="page_357">p. 357</span>

However, there was a system of direct introduction to the weather
control spirits. A kahuna who knew such a spirit and so had a connecting
shadowy thread running to it to be used in sending a prayer, could
introduce a student kahuna and so help him to set up a line of
connection through a shadowy thread.

#### <span class="smallcaps">White Man Learns to Control the Winds</span>

*Preliminary Notes:*

In the following case it will be seen that weather control can be
exerted without the use of physical stimuli such as are seen in the
ritual snake and other rain dances of our Indians in the Southwest.

*The Case:*

N. S. Emerson, now some time passed over, was a surveyor in Hawaii for
many years. His work took him to isolated parts where kahunas were still
at work, and he won the friendship of more than one healer. One kahuna,
who was adept in the high magic of weather control, undertook to teach
Mr. Emerson the art. He "introduced" him several times to the invisible
"god" (*Aumakua*) who controlled the weather, and taught him to recite a
ritual prayer to cause the winds to increase or decrease.

The kahunas demonstrated the workability of the magic repeatedly, so
giving him faith in it. Under their guidance he made the prayer and
watched its answer take form. In the end he came to be able to think of
the "god" and recite the prayer, getting results the same as his
teacher.

The prayer is a simple one which embodies definite

<span id="page_358">p. 358</span>

mental pictures or thought forms of the condition wanted. It is repeated
aloud, and forms a physical stimulus to cause the low self to make
contact and carry the telepathic request of the prayer. The prayer calls
on the "Winds of Hilo" and either asks that the little winds be put back
in the wind calabash and the large winds released to blow, or that the
large winds be put into the wind calabash and the little ones let out to
blow. Nothing in the prayer indicates the nature of its power or the
mechanism of its magic. It is not so much what is said as it is what
goes on in the low self that counts in magic.

Mr. Emerson retained his contact with the High Self of this level all
the rest of his life. Repeatedly his friends came to him to get his help
in quieting the weather when they wished to go by ship between the
islands. On the annual kite day at [Kamehameha](errata.htm#9.md) School for
Boys, he was invariably asked to be present, and to make the prayer for
the large winds to be let out of the wind calabash (symbolic, of course)
so that the big kites could go up. I have talked with a number of people
who have witnessed the blowing up of a good strong breeze within ten
minutes after the making of the prayer, although I was never fortunate
enough to see this myself. If he ever failed the boys and their kites, I
have heard nothing of the failure.

*Comment:*

Rain making was not a usual part of the activities of the kahunas who
worked to get weather control for the reason that Hawaii was blessed
with much rain in the inhabited sections.

While it is hard to imagine clouds and rain being

<span id="page_359">p. 359</span>

manufactured out of nothing by the High Selves in response to ritual
prayers, one can easily imagine a control by which distant rain clouds
could be brought to empty themselves at the desired place.

#### <span class="smallcaps">Case 31</span>

#### <span class="smallcaps">Control of Sharks and Turtles</span>

*Preliminary Notes:*

While I lived in the Hawaiian Islands I did not hear of a single case in
which sharks had attacked and eaten a live person, although the bodies
of those drowned were eaten. The sharks are supposed to have their High
Selves in each group of the islands in the Pacific, and these are
thought to have the ability to take shark form at will. Many tales are
told of the intimate relations established between human beings and
individual sharks. Families were often intimately associated with the
various creatures, and made magical pacts with their Guardian High
Selves. This gave rise to a form of totemism in which certain rites were
observed, and the totem beast of the family was not eaten by that
family.

Children and the High Selves who watch over the lower creatures seem to
have a strong affinity. Children frequently show natural psychic ability
and see the "little people." In Hawaii there is a strong belief that
human baby spirits may, under certain circumstances, be born into the
bodies of small sharks and thus keep up the totem relations between
sharks and the shark-families of humans.

(Speaking of the awareness of children—as well as primitives—to the High
Self, I am reminded of Mary Austin's story as related in her
autobiography *Earth's* 

<span id="page_360">p. 360</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> *Horizons*. As a
very small girl she came to know the superconscious and called it "I
Mary" in contrast to herself, who was just "Mary." She was able to
obtain help from this spirit in even such small things as crossing a log
over a creek which she could not cross without help. In later life she
found that the Piute Indians knew the same High Self and called it
*Wakanda* or "The Friend of the Soul of Man." All her life she prayed to
this "I Mary" when in difficulty, and seldom failed to get help.)

In Samoa there was, at least up to 1934, a rite by which children
repeated simple chants and, so it seems, made contact with the High
Selves in control of sharks and turtles in those regions.

*The Case:*

In the *Geographic News Bulletin*, issue of December 10, 1934, (National
Geographic Society) Mr. George H. Hutchinson gave an eye witness account
of the ritual of "Calling the Shark and the Turtle" at the village of
Vai Togi, Samoa.

The native children and adults gathered for the ceremony, then the
children were sent alone to a point of land jutting over the sea. There
they recited an old legend telling how a prince and princess had been
changed to a shark and turtle respectively. As they chanted they
beckoned. In about five minutes a small shark four or five feet long
appeared in the clear water beyond the breaking waves, swam around in
plain sight for about a minute, and then departed. Soon a turtle
appeared in a like manner, remained for a short time, and swam back to
deep water.

<span id="page_361">p. 361</span>

*Comment:*

The training of the young to become kahunas began early. By the age of
nine or ten it was intensified. It may well be that such training helped
the low self of the child to easier and more automatic contact with the
High Self or *Aumakua*, and we moderns may some day begin such training
at a similarly early time.

In Christianity there is a hint at such a procedure in the words of
Jesus: "Suffer little children to come unto me and forbid them not."

 

Of significance is the fact that the kahunas were "introduced" to the
High Selves of weather and nature control for the purpose of
establishing a connecting thread of shadowy substance between these High
Selves and the student kahuna.

This may have been an ancient mechanism from which sprang the idea in
various religions that new priests had to be ordained. Ordination was
accomplished through the aid of an already ordained (or introduced)
priest, and once the link was established between the priest and the
High Being, he was ready to begin his ministry.

In India there still is a rite by which this form of introduction or
thread-connecting is accomplished. The teacher acts to cause the
contact, even while not knowing its mechanisms, and suddenly the pupil
finds himself able to touch the High Self and becomes "illumined." This
rite usually included a physical contact between teacher and pupil,
sometimes a slap or even a kick, and it may be that in this act a thread
of contact is established

<span id="page_362">p. 362</span>

through the teacher's shadowy body to that of his High Self.

While these matters are still less than fully understood, the fact that
a connecting thread is needed stands out clearly at all times. Various
ways seem to be effective to remove complexed blockings and open the
path of telepathic communication.

In due time, when we come to experiment on a larger scale to learn to
duplicate the works of the kahunas, we may find a way to become
"introduced" to those High Selves presiding over the lower forms of
life, among which are the parasitic growths which afflict man. Through
these Selves we may cause the cancers and tumors to leave. Germs may be
handled in a like manner. Only recently I read an account of a person
who spoke aloud to the ants in and around her home, promising them the
run of the garden unmolested if they would keep out of the house. The
pact was effective and continued up to the time of writing the report.
