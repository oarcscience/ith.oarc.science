### NOTE

Letters will be welcomed by the author of this report from any who have
begun experimental work, and have obtained results which may be of
interest to other experimenters; or from those who wish to help organize
study and experimental groups in their own vicinities; or who may wish
in other ways to have a part in the exciting work of pushing forward the
next phase of the Huna investigation—the experimental phase.

The courtesy of a stamped and self-addressed envelope accompanying
letters will be greatly appreciated.
