### CHAPTER IX

### THE SIGNIFICANCE OF SEEING INTO THE FUTURE IN THE PSYCHOMETRIC PHENOMENA AND IN DREAMS

To be able to see a future event before it occurs is even more amazing
than fire-walking. One can, by stretching a point, imagine that there
are physical explanations for fire-immunity, but by no stretch of the
imagination can a physical explanation be given for seeing into the
future.

It is all as clear as day. A future event has not yet transpired,
therefore it is utterly impossible to see it or know in exact detail
what that event will be. But, the impossible and incredible happens. We
actually see events before they occur, in dreams or visions. We sense
future occurrences and call this sensing "premonition."

There is a third "impossibility" which stands beside fire-immunity and
prevision as proof that there are higher and little known powers at work
in this world of ours. This third thing is instant healing—a matter
which will be considered at much length later on because of its great
importance.

As a secondary, but most desirable and practical part of the Huna lore
of seeing future events, there is to be considered the magical practice
of changing the future

<span id="page_162">p. 162</span>

in order to better events which are seen and found to be undesirable.
This magical art was a large part of the work of the kahunas, for they
healed both body and purse—social and economic tangles.

While it is of the utmost importance that we recover Huna and so add to
our priceless store of human knowledge, it is even more important that
we learn the ancient methods of calling down instant healing and of
gaining the help of the High Selves in changing and reconstructing the
accidental future so that it becomes ordered, planned and fortunate.

As a matter of fact, it may be said that instant healing, or even the
slower psychological healing practiced by the kahunas, is directly
related to changing the future. If a patient is very ill and is suddenly
healed, that change in itself marks a change in the ordinary course of
the future in which the illness might have resulted in eventual death.

Aside from the usual explanation that "God knows and shows the future"
in dreams, prevision, premonition or clairvoyance, call it what we will,
we moderns have nothing faintly resembling an explanation to offer.
However, we have accumulated considerable information as to the
occurrence of these glimpses of the future, and this information can be
used to check against the theories of Huna—which are the only detailed
and logical explanations mankind has ever evolved.

There are several items of popular belief or disbelief that need to be
discussed briefly before going on. The first of these is part and parcel
of most religions, and raises a question which only the kahunas can
answer in a conclusive manner.

<span id="page_163">p. 163</span>

#### <span class="smallcaps">The Problem of Free Will and Premonition</span>

In religions, war has long raged between those who taught that man had
free will to do as he pleased, and those who taught that, because God
must (if rightly understood and evaluated as a Creator) know everything
that each one of us will do in future, we have no free will—our every
act being decided upon in advance by a Supreme Being, and, therefore,
predestined, unchangeable and inevitable.

Science, in grappling with the problem, has taught that everything
happens in a purely accidental manner and that free will is the answer.
(Overlooking the fact which bothers the religionists, that the future
can be, and often is, seen.)

The bare and uncompromising records of the Psychical Research Societies
tell of many instances in which events have been foreseen, and have been
avoided by what cannot be described as anything but the exercise of
"free will" on the part of those who were warned. In "my own experience
I had such a case.

One evening at a Spiritualistic seance I was told by an entranced medium
that I was slated to have a bad auto accident in the near future. I
countered by asking whether my friend, Bob, sitting at my right, was
also to have an accident. After a pause, the answer came as, "No." I
asked my friend to accompany me and help me watch for an accident-potent
situation for the next few days. Three days later, we were driving
through Honolulu, when, at a busy intersection, a drunken truck driver
drove his truck at high speed from behind a street car and came directly
at me. I happened at that instant to be watching a car crossing ahead of
me on

<span id="page_164">p. 164</span>

the opposite side. Bob, however, caught sight of the truck rushing
toward us, seized the wheel and twisted it around, and at the same time
shouted a warning. The result was that the partial turn made by my car
allowed the truck driver to squeeze in ahead of me, crumpling a front
fender instead of striking a disastrous blow full on the side of the car
where I sat.

This incident is typical of the evidence which shows that the future
which would normally occur can be foreseen, and that it is not
unavoidable, providing one is able to take the proper steps to
circumvent the aforeseen incident.

The question of the value of seeing future events is settled by the mass
of proofs (my own experience being only one of thousands) showing that,
once forewarned, we can take steps to change or evade future events. A
moment's thought will show how valuable to humanity an extension of the
faculty of premonition would be.

General or world conditions can be seen ahead and the individual can
profit by such foresight. I have a friend who saw in a dream the
financial crash of 1929, and who sold out all his stocks and invested in
government bonds. He warned several acquaintances, but his warnings were
not heeded, (the warnings were three months ahead of the crash, and all
looked rosy) and some of the acquaintances were ruined.

THE KAHUNA EXPLANATION OF THE PROBLEM OF FREE WILL VERSUS PREDESTINATION
is that the *Aumakua* or Superconscious "parental pair" of each of us
has a form of mentation, or mental power, unlike our own. It is higher
than the

<span id="page_165">p. 165</span>

power of remembering which characterizes the low self, or the power of
inductive reason which characterizes the middle self. It is such that
(among other things) it enables the High Self to see those parts of the
future which have been crystallized or "set." Much of the future is in a
fluid or uncrystallized and unset state, and so cannot be seen. Great
world events seem crystallized farthest in advance. In a like way the
long-term events in the lives of individuals are set and may be
seen—such events as marriage, accidents and death.

There is a very distinct philosophy in the kahuna beliefs concerning the
element of free will enjoyed by the low and middle selves which live
together in the human body to make the man. The High Self, which is
connected to the body by a thread of the *aka* (*kino mea*) or invisible
"shadowy body stuff" (and through this connection maintains contact) is
under some compulsion to let the lower selves exercise free will and
learn by experience UNLESS they desire and request guidance and help
from the High Self, in which case the *Aumakua* takes a hand in the
affairs of the man. Only in planning the long-term events in the life of
the man is free will seemingly denied, but even then, if proper steps
are taken to change those events, it is possible to circumvent them to a
degree.

There seem to be two kinds of free will, one for the low self in its
less highly evolved state as an *animal*, and, therefore, under the rule
of some High Self which presides over physical growth and operations
connected with the body itself. Because of this direct supervision, the
body conforms to definite and set patterns, while the

<span id="page_166">p. 166</span>

conscious mind or middle self, having more complete free will, has the
privilege of dictating the external activities of the body, although not
its internal vital functions.

It might be said that man has two High Selves, one for the low self and
its guidance, and one for the middle self. The "group soul" idea of
Theosophy closely checks with the High Self guiding the animal man, and
with the idea that the lesser animals and creatures are also guided and
informed through "instincts" by High Selves watching over them in
groups. As we cannot penetrate the plane of consciousness just above
ours—that of the High Selves—we cannot know to a certainty what the real
state is in this relation. However, we can observe the many acts and
conditions of living things on our levels and draw our conclusions. This
also holds for our observations when we see some mysterious
Consciousness using some mysterious force, through some mysterious form
of invisible matter, to produce fire-immunity, instant healing,
prevision, the material phenomena of Spiritualism, and so on and so
forth.

The kahunas also believed that ALL PREMONITION COMES FROM THE HIGH SELF
BY WAY OF THE LOW SELF or subconscious. This agrees with the known fact
that we cannot, by any effort of the will, force ourselves to see into
the future or dream of it. In hypnotized subjects, the order to look
into the future is seldom obeyed, thus causing us to conclude that the
subconscious (which alone is suggestible) does not have the ability to
look into the future. If neither the low nor the middle self can see
ahead at will and as a result of its own natural ability, we must

<span id="page_167">p. 167</span>

look for another source of prevision—look to the Super-conscious or
similar Higher Beings.

A proof that the kahunas were right in saying that all premonition must
come through the low self, lies in the fact that we get visions, dreams
or other forms of knowledge concerning future events, through the
subconscious when it is relaxed—when it is let alone by the middle self.
The most relaxed state for the low self, and the time when it is most
completely free from the domination of the middle self, is during sleep.
For this reason it is natural that premonitory dreams are the most
common sources of knowledge of future events. In crystal gazing there is
a similar relaxation but of a lesser degree. The middle self stands by
in a waking state to observe what is sensed by the low self through the
images centering around the crystal. In telepathy the low self is also
the agent performing all the work, and it has to be allowed to slip the
ordinary control of the middle self and relax in order to project its
"finger" of invisible shadowy substance, and so contact the person from
whom a telepathic or mind-reading impression is to be gained.

The verification of the kahuna belief that the low self is the one which
performs all psychic acts, always comes back to the indisputable fact
that our best known self, the middle self or conscious mind, cannot,
under any circumstance, use its will to force us to produce psychic
action. We can only give the order to the low self and then let go of it
so that, in a relaxed condition, it can set to work, exercise its
psychic abilities, and present to us through our mutual center of
consciousness the information obtained.

<span id="page_168">p. 168</span>

In getting information concerning the present, the low self can reach
out and read minds or gather telepathic impressions directed to it by
another, and otherwise act on its own initiative; but when it comes to
the future, it must contact (as in telepathy) the High Self, and ask
that it be given glimpses of the part of the future which has
crystallized and which would, therefore, be visible.

THE MAKING OF THE FUTURE, according to the kahunas, depends upon the
plans and desires of the lesser selves. These plans and desires, (and,
unfortunately our fears) are made into thought forms (composed also of
shadowy body stuff) and are used by the High Self in some seemingly
automatic process of constructing the future for the individual. Just
how this mechanism works is uncertain, as it belongs to the next higher
level of consciousness, but the kahunas spoke of the thought forms as
"seeds," which were taken by the *Aumakua* and made to grow into future
events or conditions.

The kahunas considered it of great importance for the individual to take
time out at frequent intervals to think about his life and decide in
exact terms what he wished to do or wished to have happen. The average
person is too much inclined to let the low self take the helm, which is
dangerous because it lives under the domination of the animal world
where things happen illogically and as if by accident. It is the
business and duty of the middle self, as guide for the low self, to use
its power of inductive reason and its will (to control the low self) in
making plans for the task of living, and

<span id="page_169">p. 169</span>

seeing that proper efforts are made to work according to those plans.

The average person, especially if emotional (an indication that the low
self is too much in charge) changes plans too often, also changes
desires. The result is the making of a mixture of contradictory thought
forms of plans, wishes and fears, from which the High Self, perforce,
makes a mixture of future events fully as unsatisfactory and
inconclusive.

A large part of the kahuna's magical practice in days gone was aimed at
seeing what crystallized future lay ahead for the client, then procuring
changes in that future to make it more desirable. (Later on we will take
up exhaustively the methods used by the kahunas and the nature of the
difficulties to be overcome.)

 

Dreams are the open door to premonition. Research has disclosed the fact
that in our dreams we are given to see the future almost nightly, but
that we do not remember the dreams, and so remain unaware of what is to
come except by vague uneasiness stemming from the depths of the low
self.

Little is known of dreams, although there has been much conjecture and
much muddled thinking about dream conditions. One thing, however, stands
out clearly, and that is the fact that the low self has a peculiar knack
of confusing things sensed in dreams with things familiar to it,
frequently joining one idea to another through a process of association,
to make a SYMBOL.

The practice of psychoanalysis is largely based upon

<span id="page_170">p. 170</span>

a study of these symbols as they appear in remembered dreams, or in
thoughts which come into the mind of the patient when he is in a state
of relaxation brought about (in some cases) by suggestion or mild drugs.

Dr. Nandor Fodor, one of the leaders in this field and now practicing in
New York, writes in his many articles on the subject, of a curious thing
observed in psychoanalysis. It is that certain symbols mean the same
thing even when found in the dreams of many different people, none of
whom are acquainted with the others. This seems to be more than a
coincidence, and points in the direction of the group soul, as do
similar instincts with similar reactions in creatures lower than man.

It is to be concluded that a direct "seeing" of a future event may be
passed on to us by the low self, or, it may pause to mix what it sees or
senses with things already known to it, thus producing a symbol which
the middle self will have to try to understand.

In her valuable book, *Telepathy*, Eileen J. Garrett tells of the
frequency with which telepathic messages are received in a form which is
partly symbolic. She found that her pupils, in learning telepathy, soon
became expert in grasping the meaning behind the symbols which came to
them repeatedly.

Mrs. Garrett describes her sensations when sending telepathic messages,
and writes that she has the feeling that her five senses are tied to
something like a white beam which she sends here and there with an
effort of will to contact those to whom a message is to be sent. When
this "white beam" (she does not speak of it as a beam of light) meets an
obstacle, it bends around it.

<span id="page_171">p. 171</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> The obstacle is
felt but not seen, as a rule. This "white beam" corresponds to the
kahuna idea of a "finger" of shadowy body substance which is projected
by the low self, feeling or following with great speed along the threads
of shadowy substance which already have been fastened and established as
contact or connecting mechanisms between individuals who have once met.

Mrs. Garrett also describes the sensation experienced frequently by
those who practice telepathy—the sensation of faint electric tingling or
warmth, often accompanied by a tactile response of "goose-flesh" when a
working contact has been made. In her own case these sensations often
warn her that a message is being projected to her by someone and that
her attention is needed to receive it.

Deep breathing is a common preliminary to telepathic practice or other
forms of psychometrizing—all these related forms depending on the
movement of thought forms along a thread of connecting shadowy body
stuff. Deep breathing seems to help in getting the low self to relax and
set to work. Impressions come frequently as from below the solar plexus,
which has been considered the main seat of the low self when sending out
or receiving messages or sensory impressions.

A slightly different phase of telepathy is one in which distant scenes
appear before the inner eye. This is often called "clairvoyance," and it
occasionally includes glimpses of events that will transpire in the
future.

According to the kahunas, any glimpse or knowledge of the future which
comes in connection with psychic practices, must be given by the High
Self. Mrs. Garrett writes very clearly of her sense of greater alertness

<span id="page_172">p. 172</span>

and of her quickening perceptions when she makes contact with what she
has called the "superconscious," and from her statements, it is to be
deduced that she contacts the same High Self described in the Huna
philosophy. A similar increase in lucidity and a similar sharpening of
the senses and perceptions has been mentioned by other psychics,
particularly when they were fully or partially out of the physical body,
either in a state known as "astral projection" or when they had left the
body while a controlling spirit used it during trance states.

 

After these explanations and comments a better understanding of the case
materials given in the next chapter will be possible. It must always be
kept in mind that this is a very important part of magic, and that it
needs understanding in careful detail to become practical in our hands,
as it was in the hands of the kahunas.
