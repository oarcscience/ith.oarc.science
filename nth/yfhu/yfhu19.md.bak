### CHAPTER XVII

#### THE BUILDING POWER OF CONSTRUCTIVE SPEECH

There is a science of speech, and whoever wishes to promote his welfare
and advancement must understand this science thoroughly and regulate his
speech accordingly. Every word that is spoken exercises a power in
personal life, and that power will work either for or against the
person, depending upon the nature of the word. You can talk yourself
into trouble, poverty or disease, and you can talk yourself into
harmony, health and prosperity. In brief, you can talk yourself into
almost any condition, desirable or undesirable.

Every word is an expression and every expression produces a tendency in
some part of the system. This tendency may appear in the mind, in the
body, in the chemical life of the body, in the world of desire, in
character, among the various faculties, or anywhere in the personality,
and will work itself out wherever it appears. Our expressions determine
largely where we are to go, what we are to accomplish, and how we are to
meet those conditions through which we may pass.

<span id="page_262">p. 262</span>

When our expressions produce tendencies towards sickness and failure, we
will begin to move towards those conditions, and if the tendency is very
strong, all the creative energies in the system will move in the same
direction, focusing their efforts upon sickness and failure, or taking
those conditions as their models, and thereby producing such conditions
in the system. On the other hand, when our expressions produce
tendencies towards health, happiness, power and success, we will begin
to move towards those things, and in like manner create them in a
measure.

Every word has an inner life force, sometimes called the hidden power of
words, and it is the nature of this power that determines whether the
expression is to be favorable or not. This power may be constructive or
destructive. It may move towards the superior or the inferior. It may
promote your purpose in life or it may retard that purpose, and it is
the strongest when it is deeply felt. Therefore, the words which we
inwardly feel are the words that act as turning points in life. When you
feel that trouble is coming, and express that feeling in your speech,
you are actually turning in your path and are beginning to move towards
that trouble. In addition, you are creating troubled conditions in your
system. We all know that the more trouble we feel in the midst of
trouble, the more troublesome that trouble will become. And we also know
that that person who retains poise and self-control in the

<span id="page_263">p. 263</span>

midst of trouble, will pass through it all without being seriously
affected; and when it is over, is much wiser and stronger for the
experience.

When you feel that better days are coming, and express that feeling in
your speech, you turn all the power of your being towards the ideal of
better days, and those powers will begin to create the better in your
life. Whenever you talk about success, advancement, or any desirable
condition, try to express the feeling of those things in your words.
This inner feeling determines the tendencies of your creative powers;
therefore, when you feel success in your speech, you cause the creative
powers to create qualities in yourself that can produce success, while
if you express the feeling of doubt, failure or loss in your words,
those creative powers will produce inferiority, disturbance, discord,
and a tendency to mistakes. It is in this way that the thing we fear
comes upon us. Fear is a feeling that feels the coming of ills or other
things we do not want; and as we always express through our words the
feelings that we fear, we form tendencies toward those things, and the
creative powers within us will produce them.

Whether the inner life force of a word will be constructive or
destructive depends upon several factors, the most important of which
are the tone, the motive and the idea. The tone of every word should be
harmonious, wholesome, pleasing, and

<span id="page_264">p. 264</span>

should convey a deep and serene expression. Words that express whines,
discontent, sarcasm, aggressiveness and the like are destructive; so
much so, that no one can afford to employ them under any circumstance
whatever. Nothing is ever gained by complaints that are complaining, nor
by criticisms that criticise. When things are not right, state so in a
tone of voice that is firm and strong, but kind. A wronged customer who
employs sweetness of tone as well as firmness of expression is one who
will receive the first attention and the best attention, and nothing
will be left unturned until the matter is set right. The words that
wound others do far more injury to the person who gives them expression.
No one therefore can afford to give expression to a single word that may
tend to wound. Words of constructive power are always deeply felt. They
are never loud or confusing, but always quiet and serene, filled with
the very spirit of conviction.

Never give expression to what you do not wish to encourage. The more you
talk about a thing the more you help it along. The "walls have ears" and
the world is full of minds that will act upon your suggestion. Never
mention the dark side of anything. It will interfere with your welfare.
To tell your troubles may give you temporary relief, but it is
scattering seed broadcast that will produce another crop of more
trouble. If you have troubles, turn your back upon them and proceed to
talk about

<span id="page_265">p. 265</span>

harmony, freedom, attainment and success, and feel deeply the spirit of
these new and better conditions. Thus you will begin to create for
yourself a new life, new opportunities, new environment and a new world.
Never speak unless you have something to say that gives cheer,
encouragement, information or wholesome entertainment. To talk for the
mere sake of talking is to throw precious energy away, and no human
chatterbox will ever acquire greatness.

The motive back of every word should be constructive, and the life
expressed in every word should convey the larger, the better and the
superior. Such words have building power, and are additions to life of
extreme value. Every word should express, as far as possible, the
absolute truth, and should never convey ideas that are simply indicated
by appearances.

What is meant by speaking the absolute truth, however, is a matter that
the majority do not understand, and as it is a very large subject, it
would require pages to give even a brief scientific definition. But for
practical purposes, the subject can be made sufficiently clear through
the use of a few illustrations taken from the world's daily speech.
People who think they have to say something and have nothing in
particular to say, always take refuge in a brief description of the
weather. In their descriptions they usually employ such expressions as
"It is terribly hot," "It is an awful day," "This is

<span id="page_266">p. 266</span>

terrible weather," "This is a miserably cold day," and so on. But such
expressions do not change the weather, and there is no use of talking if
your words are not to be of value in some way. You may say all sorts of
disagreeable things about the weather without changing the weather in
the least, but will such expressions leave you unchanged? Positively
not! Whenever you declare that something is horrible, you cause horrible
thoughts to send their actions all through your nervous system. These
actions may be weak, but many drops, no matter how small, will finally
wear away a rock.

When people talk about themselves, they seldom fail to give expression
to a score of detrimental statements. Here are a few: "I can't stand
this," "I feel so tired," "I cannot bear to think of it," "I am
thoroughly disgusted," "I am so susceptible to climatic changes," "I am
so sensitive and so easily disturbed," "I am getting weak and nervous,"
"My memory is failing," "I am getting old," "I cannot work the way I
used to," "My strength is gradually leaving me," "There is no chance for
me any more," "Everything in life is uphill work," "I have passed a
miserable night," "This has been a hard day," "I have nothing but
trouble and bad luck," "You know I am human and so very weak," "There is
always something wrong no matter how hard you try," "You know I have to
be so very careful

<span id="page_267">p. 267</span>

about what I eat as nearly everything disagrees with me."

A thousand other statements, all of them destructive, might be
mentioned, but any one who understands the power of thought will realize
at once that such statements can never be otherwise but injurious and
should therefore be avoided absolutely. But these statements are not
only injurious—they are also untrue—absolutely untrue in every sense of
the term.

The fact is you can stand almost anything if you forget your human
weakness and array yourself in spiritual strength. You do not have to
get tired. Work does not make any one tired so long as he gets eight
hours of sleep every night. It is wrong thinking that makes people
tired. These are scientific facts. That person who permits himself to
become disgusted at anything whatever is talking himself down to the
plane of inferiority. When you feel disgusted you think disgusting
thoughts, and such thoughts clog the mind. You cannot afford to think
disgusting thoughts simply because something else is disgusting, because
we daily become like the thoughts we think. We cannot improve
disagreeable things by making ourselves disagreeable. Two wrongs never
made a right. The proper course is to forgive the wrong-doer, forget the
wrong and then do something substantial to right the whole matter. When
we think kindly of the weather, place ourselves

<span id="page_268">p. 268</span>

in harmony with Nature, think properly and dress properly, we shall not
be susceptible to changes in the atmosphere; but so long as we say that
we are effected by changing atmospheres, we not only make ourselves
negative and susceptible, but we also produce detrimental effects in our
systems through our own unwholesome beliefs. The man who constantly
thinks he is easily disturbed disturbs himself. When we are in harmony
with everything including ourselves and refuse to be otherwise, nothing
will ever disturb us. That person who is nervous can make the matter
worse by saying that he is nervous, because such a statement is a
nervous statement and is full of discord. When we begin to feel nervous,
we can remedy the matter absolutely by resolving to remain calm, and by
employing only quiet, wholesome and constructive speech. Your words will
cause you to move in the direction indicated by the nature of those
words, and it is just as easy to use words that bring calmness and
poise, as those that bring inharmony and confusion.

Modern science has demonstrated conclusively that there is nothing about
a person that gets old. Therefore, to say that you are getting old is to
persist in speaking the untruth, and it is but natural that you should
reap as you sow. We must remember that a false appearance comes from the
practice of judging from appearances. To state that your strength is
failing is likewise to speak the untruth. There is

<span id="page_269">p. 269</span>

but one strength in the universe—the strength of the Supreme—and that
strength can never fail. You may have as much of that strength as you
desire. All that is necessary for you to do is to live in perfect touch
with the Supreme, and never think, do or say anything that will
interfere with that sublime oneness. The strength of the Supreme is just
as able to fill your system with life and power now as it was at any
time in the past. Therefore, there is no real reason whatever why your
powers should diminish. Be true to the truth and your power will
perpetually increase.

The belief that there are no opportunities for you is caused by the fact
that you have hidden yourself in a cave of inferiority. Go out into the
life of worth, ability and competence, and you will find more
opportunities than you can use. The world is ever in search of competent
minds, and modern knowledge has made it possible for man to develop his
ability. No one therefore has any legitimate reason for speaking of hard
luck or hard times unless he prefers to live in want. The more you
complain about hard times, the harder times will become for you, while
if you resolve to forget that there is such a thing as failure and
proceed to make your own life as you wish it to be, the turn in the lane
will surely come.

The idea that the pathway of life is all uphill work is also a false
one, and if we give that idea expression we are simply placing obstacles
in our way.

<span id="page_270">p. 270</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Nothing is uphill
work when we approach it properly, and there is nothing that helps more
to place us in true relationship with things than true expression.

If the night has been unpleasant, never mention the fact for a moment.
To talk about it will only produce more unpleasantness in your system.
There is nothing wrong about the night. The unpleasantness was most
likely produced by your own perverse appetite, or by some reckless
inexcusable act. Forgive yourself and declare that you will never abuse
nature any more. Such powerful words if repeated often, will turn the
tendency of your habits, and your life will become natural and
wholesome.

No day would be hard if we met all things with the conviction that we
are equal to every occasion. Live properly, think properly, work
properly and talk properly, and trouble and ill-luck will not trouble
you seriously any more. That person who declares that there is always
something wrong is always doing something to make things wrong. When we
have wrong on the brain we will make many mistakes, so there will always
be something wrong brewing for us. When wrong things come, set them
right and look upon the experience as an opportunity for you to develop
greater mastership.

When you agree with yourself, all wholesome and properly prepared food
will agree with you. But you cannot expect food to agree with you so
long as

<span id="page_271">p. 271</span>

you are disagreeable; and to declare that this or that always disagrees
with you, is to fill your system with disagreeable thoughts, disturbed
actions and conditions of discord. That nature can digest food under
such circumstances no one can justly expect. There is nothing that
injures digestion more than the habit of finding fault with the food. If
you do not think that you can eat this or that, leave it alone, but
leave it alone mentally as well as physically. It is not enough to drop
a disagreeable thing from your hands; you must also drop it from your
mind.

Remember, you are mentally living with everything that you talk about,
and there is nothing that affects us more than that which we take into
our mental life. It is therefore not only necessary to speak the truth
about all things, but also to avoid speaking about those things that are
unwholesome. To speak about that which is wrong or inferior is never
wholesome, no matter how closely we think we stand by the facts. Seeming
facts, or what is called relative truth, should never receive expression
unless they deal with that which is conducive to higher worth; and when
circumstances compel us to make exceptions to this rule, we should avoid
giving any feeling to what we say.

The greatest essential, however, is to make all speech constructive.
Search for the real truth that is at the foundation of all life, and
then give expression to such words as convey the full significance to

<span id="page_272">p. 272</span>

that truth. The results, to say the least, will be extraordinary.

In daily conversation, the law of constructive speech should be most
conscientiously applied. What we say to others will determine to a
considerable degree what they are to think, and what tendencies their
mental actions are to follow; and since man is the product of his
thought, conversation becomes a most important factor in man.

We steadily grow into the likeness of that which we think of the most,
and what we are to think about depends largely upon the mode, the nature
and the subject matter of our conversation. When conversation originates
or intensifies the tendency to think about the wrong, the ordinary or
the inferior, it becomes destructive, and likewise it tends to keep
before mind the faults and defects that may exist in human nature. To be
constructive, conversation should tend to turn attention upon the better
side, the stronger side, the superior side of all things, and should
give the ideal the most prominent place in thought, speech or
expression. All conversation should be so formed that it may tend to
move the mind towards the higher domains of thought, and should make
everybody more keenly conscious of the greater possibilities that exist
within them. No word should ever be spoken that will, in any way, bring
the person's faults or short-comings before his mind, nor should any
form of speech be permitted that may

<span id="page_273">p. 273</span>

cause sadness, offense, depression or pain. Every word should convey
hope, encouragement and sunshine.

To constantly remind a person of his faults is to cause him to become
more keenly conscious of those faults. He will think more and more about
his faults, and will thereby cause his faults to become more prominent
and more troublesome than they ever were before. The more we think about
our weakness, the weaker we become; and the more we talk about weakness,
the more we think about weakness. Conversation therefore should never
touch upon those things that we do not wish to retain or develop. The
only way to remove weakness is to develop strength, and to develop
strength we must keep attention constantly upon the quality of strength.
We develop what we think about provided all thinking has depth, quality
and continuity.

Conversation has exceptional value in the training of young minds, and
in many instances may completely change the destinies of these minds. To
properly train a child, his attention should be directed as much as
possible upon those qualities that have worth and that are desired in
his development; and the way he is spoken to will largely determine
where he is to give the greater part of his attention. To scold a child
is to remind him of his faults. Every time he is reminded of his faults
he gives more attention, more thought, and more strength to those

<span id="page_274">p. 274</span>

faults. His good qualities are thereby made weaker while his bad
qualities are made worse. It is not possible to improve the mind and the
character of the child by constantly telling him not to do "this" or
"that." As a rule, it will increase his desire to do this other thing,
and he will cease only through fear, or after having wasted a great deal
of time in experiences that have become both disgusting and bitter.

It is the tendency of every mind to desire to do what it is told not to
do, the reason being that negative commands are nearly always associated
with fear; and when the mind is in the attitude of fear, or dread or
curiosity, it is very easily impressed by whatever it may be thinking
about.

When we are warned we either enter a state of fear or one of curiosity,
and while in those states, our minds are so deeply and so easily
impressed by that from which we are warned, that we give it our whole
attention. The result is we think so much about it that we become almost
completely absorbed in it; and we are carried away, so to speak, not
away from the danger, but into it.

When any one is going wrong, it is a mistake to warn him not to go
further. It is also a mistake to leave him alone. The proper course is
to call his attention to something better, and frame our conversation in
such a way that he becomes wholly absorbed in the better. He will then
forget his old mistakes,

<span id="page_275">p. 275</span>

his old faults and his old desires, and will give all his life and power
to the building of that better which has engaged his new interest.

The same law may be employed to prevent sickness and failure. When the
mind becomes so completely absorbed in perfect health that all sickness
is forgotten, all the powers of mind will proceed to create health, and
every trace of sickness will soon disappear. When the mind becomes so
completely absorbed in higher attainments and in greater achievements
that all thought of failure is forgotten, all the forces of mind will
begin to work for the promotion of those attainments and achievements.
The person will be gaining ground every day, and greater success will
positively follow.

To cause the mind to forget the wrong, the lesser and the inferior,
constructive conversation may be employed with unfailing results; in
fact, such conversation must be employed if the mind is to advance and
develop. Our conversation must be in perfect accord with our ambitions,
our desires, and our ideals, and all our expressions must aim to promote
the real purpose we have in view.

It is the tendency of nearly every mind to try to make his friends
perfect according to his own idea of perfection, and he usually proceeds
by constantly talking to his friends about their faults, and what they
should not do in order to become as perfect as his ideal. Parents, as a
rule, do the same with their

<span id="page_276">p. 276</span>

children, not knowing that through this method many are made worse; and
it is only those who are very strong in mind and character that are not
adversely affected by this method.

To help our friends or our children to become ideal, we should never
mention their faults. Our conversation should deal with the strong
points of character and the greater possibilities of mind. We should so
frame our conversation that we tend to make everybody feel there is
something in them. Our conversation should have an optimistic tendency
and an ascending tone. It should deal with those things in life that are
worth while, and it should always give the ideal the greatest
prominence. Weaknesses of human nature should be recognized as little as
possible, and should seldom, if ever, be mentioned. When people engage
in destructive conversation in our midst we should try to change the
subject, by calling their attention to the better side. There always is
another and a better side; and when examined closely will be found to be
far greater and infinitely more important than the ordinary side.
Admirable qualities exist everywhere, and it will prove profitable to
give these our undivided attention.
