### CHAPTER XI

#### CONCENTRATION AND THE POWER BACK OF SUGGESTION

The purpose of concentration is to apply all the active forces of mind
and personality upon that one thing which is being done now, and it may
therefore be called the master key to all attainments and achievement.
In its last analysis, the cause of all failure can be traced to the
scattering of forces, and the cause of all achievement to the
concentration of forces. This does not imply however, that concentration
is the only essential, but it does imply that concentration must be
perfect, or failure is inevitable no matter how many good methods one
may employ. The ruling thought of concentration is, "This one thing I
do," and it can be stated as an absolute truth that whenever the mind
works completely in the attitude of that thought, concentration is
perfect.

The value of concentration is very easily illustrated by taking, for
example, a wheel of twenty spokes with every spoke a pipe, and all those
pipes connected with another conveying steam. The steam will thereby
pass out through twenty channels. Then connect an engine with one of the
pipes. That engine

<span id="page_158">p. 158</span>

will accordingly receive only one-twentieth of the steam conveyed
through the wheel, while nineteen-twentieths will pass out in waste. But
suppose the other nineteen pipes were plugged so that all the steam
would pass out through the one pipe connected with the engine. The
engine would then have twenty times as much power as before.

The average mind is quite similar to such a wheel. An enormous amount of
energy is generated at the hub, so to speak, or at the vital center of
mental life; but as a rule, that power passes out through a score of
channels, so that the channel of action receives only a fraction of the
power generated in the human system. But here we must remember that you
can apply your power effectively only in one direction at a time;
therefore, if all your power is to be applied in that one direction, all
other channels must be closed up for the time being; or in other words,
all the power of mind and thought must be concentrated where you are
acting at the time.

In learning how to concentrate, it is necessary in the beginning to
remember that the usual methods are of no value. You cannot develop
concentration by fixing thought or attention upon some external object.
Real concentration is subjective, and subjective thought is deep; that
is, it acts through the deeper or interior realms of mind. When you fix
your attention, however, upon some external object, like a spot on the
wall, as has been suggested by

<span id="page_159">p. 159</span>

some would-be instructors in this field, your thought goes out towards
the surface, so that you are actually getting away from the true field
of concentration. Any method, or any line of thinking that tends to draw
the mind out towards the surface, will produce a superficial attitude,
and when the mind is in such an attitude, deep mental action is not
possible; but deep mental action is absolutely necessary in all
concentration. There is no use trying to concentrate unless the action
of the mind is deep. That is the first essential. In other words, the
mind must go into the psychological field; the mind must act, not on the
surface of things, but through the deeper life of its thought process.

To develop concentration, all that is necessary is to apply consciously
those two factors that are invariably found in natural concentration. In
the conscious application of these two factors, the following two
methods will be found sufficient; in fact, nothing further will be
required in the attainment of concentration to any degree desired.

The first method is to train the mind to act in the subjective or
psychological field; in other words, cause all thinking, all feeling and
all actions of thought, will and desire to become deeper and finer; in
fact, deepen as far as possible all mental action. Whenever you
concentrate or turn your attention upon any subject or object, try to
feel deeply, try to think deeply and try to turn thought into deeper

<span id="page_160">p. 160</span>

realms of feeling. The moment your mental action begins to deepen, you
will find your attention directed upon the object in mind with perfect
ease and with full force. Whenever you are thinking about anything, try
to feel your thought getting into the vital life of that something, and
wherever you turn your attention, try to feel that the force of that
attention acts through your whole mind instead of simply on the surface
of your mind. To state it briefly, whenever you concentrate, deepen your
thought, and the deeper your thought becomes, the more perfectly will
the full force of your mind and thought focus upon the point of
concentration. Whatever you have to do, deepen your thought while giving
that work your attention. You will find that you will thereby give all
your energy to that work and this is your purpose.

The second method is to become interested in that upon which you desire
to concentrate. If you are not interested in that subject or object,
begin at once to look for the most interesting point of view. You will
be surprised to find that no matter how uninteresting a subject may
seem, the very moment you begin to look for the most interesting
viewpoints of that subject, you will almost immediately become
interested in that subject itself. And it is a well-known fact that
whenever we are thoroughly interested in a subject, we concentrate
thoroughly and naturally upon that subject.

<span id="page_161">p. 161</span>

To make concentration perfect, so that you can turn all the power of
mind and thought upon any subject or object desired, these two methods
should be combined. Always look for the most interesting points of view,
and while you are looking for those viewpoints, deepen the action of
your mind by trying to feel the real vital life of those actions. You
thereby become interested in the subject on the one hand, and you make
every action of the mind subjective on the other hand; and when perfect
interest is combined with subjective mental action, you have perfect
concentration.

The constant practice of these two methods will develop the power of
concentration to such an extent that you can concentrate completely at
any time and for any length of time, by simply deciding to do so; and
that such an attainment is of enormous value is evident when we
understand how much power there is in man, and how concentration can
turn all of that power upon the one thing that is being done now.

All modern psychologists agree that there is enough power in any man to
accomplish what he has in view, provided it is all constructively
applied in that one direct. And when man can concentrate perfectly, he
can use all of his power wherever he may choose to act. Then, if he
combines scientific thinking and constructive mental action with
concentration,

<span id="page_162">p. 162</span>

nothing can prevent him from realizing his very highest ambition.

Another important essential in the use of the forces of mind and
thought, is that of understanding suggestion and the power back of
suggestion; and this becomes especially true when we realize that there
is no factor or condition that we may come in contact with anywhere or
under any circumstances, that does not suggest something.

To define suggestion, it may be stated that anything is a suggestion
that brings into mind some thought, idea or feeling that tends to
undermine some similar idea, thought or feeling that happens to be in
the mind at the time. When you have certain ideas or feelings, and you
meet circumstances that tend to remove those ideas or feelings, the
power of suggestion is working in your mind. If your mind is in a
wholesome state and an unwholesome picture removes that wholesome state
by replacing something that is degrading, your mind is in the power of
suggestion. If you feel joyous and some idea given to you makes your
mind depressed, you are in the hands of suggestion; in fact, when
anything enters your mind in such a manner as to remove certain similar
or opposite states already in your mind, it exercises the power of
suggestion.

It is therefore necessary to understand how this power works, so that we
can take advantage of good suggestions and avoid those that are not
good. The

<span id="page_163">p. 163</span>

great majority are receiving all sorts of suggestions every hour, and
they respond to a very large number of them; in fact, we can truthfully
say that most people are controlled, most of the time, by suggestions
that come to them from their environment. Those minds, however, who
understand the power of thought, and who know the difference between
detrimental and beneficial suggestions, can close their minds to the
former and open them fully to the latter. And the method to apply is
this, that whenever you are in the presence of an adverse suggestion,
concentrate your attention upon some idea or mental state which you know
will act as a counter suggestion; in other words, when adverse
suggestion is trying to produce in your mind what you do not want,
persist in suggesting to yourself what you do want. This practice, if
employed frequently, will soon make you so strong in this direction that
you will unconsciously, so to speak, be on your guard; in fact, the very
moment that an adverse suggestion is given, your mind will spring up of
its own accord with a wholesome suggestion to meet the requirements. To
avoid becoming a victim to adverse suggestions—and we have such
suggestions about us almost constantly—fill your mind so full of good,
wholesome thoughts and suggestions that there is no room for anything
else. Feel right at all times, and nothing from without can tempt you to
think wrong. Make every good thought subconscious, and no adverse
thought from

<span id="page_164">p. 164</span>

without can possibly get into your subconscious mind at any time.

A great many suggestions do not produce results, a fact which should be
perfectly understood, because every thought that we think does contain
some suggestion. When we are trying to impress good thoughts upon our
minds, we want the good suggestions conveyed by those thoughts to take
effect, but frequently they do not, and the reason is that a suggestion
takes effect only when we exercise the power that is back of suggestion.
The outward suggestion itself is simply the vehicle through which
another power is acting, and that other power is nothing more nor less
than the real life of that idea which the suggestion intends to convey.

To simplify this matter, we will suppose that you are suggesting to
yourself that you are well. The suggestion itself is simply a vehicle
conveying the idea of health, but if your mind is not in touch with the
interior or living force of that idea of health at the time you are
giving the suggestion, you have not exercised the power back of
suggestion, and the idea of health will not be conveyed to your
subconscious mind. On the other hand, if you can actually feel the power
of this interior idea of health when you are giving the suggestion, you
are in mental touch with the power back of that suggestion, and whenever
you touch the power back of suggestion you use that power. Results,
therefore, will be forthcoming. To

<span id="page_165">p. 165</span>

explain further, we might say that you use the power back of suggestion
whenever you mentally feel that vital idea which the suggestion aims to
convey. When you feel that idea, you respond to the suggestion, but when
you do not feel it, you do not respond.

This explains why the power of suggestion so frequently fails, not only
in every day life, but also in mental healing. When you think health,
you will produce health in your system if you feel the real or interior
life of health at the time. When you think harmony you will produce
harmony in your system, if your mind actually goes into the soul of
harmony at the time. When you place yourself in the mental world of
happiness, whenever you are thinking, happiness, you will actually
produce happiness in your mind, because you are applying the power that
is back of the thought that suggests happiness.

Two men may present the same proposition under the same circumstances,
and you will accept the proposition from the one, while ignoring the
arguments of the other completely. The reason will be that while the one
is talking about his proposition, the other is talking through his
proposition. The mind of the one goes on the outside of his arguments
and his suggestions, while the mind of the other goes through the real
inner life of those arguments and suggestions. Therefore, the one is
only using suggestion, while the other is also using the power

<span id="page_166">p. 166</span>

back of suggestion; and it is the power back of suggestion that produces
results, whenever results are secured. The same idea is illustrated when
a person is speaking on a certain subject. If his description deals
simply with the shell of that subject, he does not attract attention,
but the moment he touches the vital or inner factors of that subject,
everybody is interested. The reason is, he has touched the power back of
his theme. But we all have ideas or suggestions to present at frequent
intervals. Therefore, if we can use the power back of our suggestion at
such times we may receive a hearing, but if we cannot, we attract little
or no attention.

Thus we understand the value of knowing how to use the power back of
suggestion, and we can learn to use this power by training ourselves to
get into the real life of every idea and every thought that we may try
to think or convey. When we try to live our ideas and thoughts, we will
begin to express that interior power, and we shall succeed in living our
ideas when we try to feel consciously and constantly the real life and
the real truth that is contained in those ideas.

To secure the best results from the power of thought in its various
modes of application, we must understand that there is something back of
everything that takes form or action in life, and that it is through
this something that the actions of mind should move whenever we use
thought or suggestion

<span id="page_167">p. 167</span>

in any manner whatever. When we are conscious only of the body of our
ideas, those ideas convey no power. It is when we become conscious of
the soul of those ideas that we have aroused that something within that
alone produces results in the mental world. Any thought or suggestion
that conveys simply the external form, invariably falls flat. There is
nothing to it. It is entirely empty, and produces no impression
whatever. But our ideas and suggestions become alive with the fullness
of life and power when we also convey the real life or the real soul
that is contained within the body of those thoughts. We have, at such
times, entered the depths of mental life. We are beginning to act
through undercurrents, and we are beginning to draw upon the immensity
of that power that exists in the vast interior realms of our own mental
world.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

*Say to yourself a hundred times every day and mean it with all your
heart: I will become more than I am. I will achieve more and more every
day because I know that I can. I will recognize only that which is good
in myself; only that which is good in others; only that in all things
and places that I know should live and grow. When adversity threatens I
will be more determined than ever in my life to prove that I can turn
all things to good account. And when those whom I have trusted seem to
fail me, I will have a thousand times more faith in the honor and
nobleness of man. I will think only of that which has virtue and worth.
I will wish only for that which can give freedom and truth. I will
expect only that which can add to the welfare of the race. I will live
to live more. I will speak to give encouragement, inspiration and joy. I
will work to be of service to an ever-increasing number. And in every
thought, word and action my ruling desire shall be, to enrich, ennoble
and beautify existence for all who come my way*.
