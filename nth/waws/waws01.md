### PREFACE.

There are two reasons the author has for putting forth this little
volume: he feels that the time is, as it always has been, ripe for it;
and second, his soul has ever longed to express itself upon this endless
theme. It therefore comes from the heart—the basis of his belief that it
will reach the heart.

R. W. T.

*Boston, Massachusetts*.

#### PREFACE TO REVISED EDITION.

It is impossible for one in a single volume, or perhaps in a number of
volumes, to reach the exact needs of every reader.

It is always a source of gratitude, as well as of inspiration for better
and more earnest work in the future, for one to know that the truths
that have been and that are so valuable and so vital to him he has
succeeded in presenting in a manner such that they prove likewise of
value to others. The author is most grateful for the good, kind words
that have come so generously from so many hundreds of readers of this
simple little volume from all parts of the world. He is also grateful to
that large company of people who have been so good as to put the book
into the hands of so many others.

And as the days have passed, he has not been unmindful of the fact that
he might make it, when the time came, of still

<span id="page_vi">p. vi</span>

greater value to many. In addition to a general revision of the book,
some four or five questions that seemed to be most frequently asked he
has endeavored to point answer to in an added part of some thirty pages,
under the general title, "Character-building Thought Power." The volume
enters therefore upon its fifteenth thousand better able, possibly, to
come a little more directly in touch with the every-day needs of those
who will be sufficiently interested to read it.
