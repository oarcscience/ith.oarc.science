<p>The Greatest Thing Ever Known.</p>
<p>The moment we fully and vitally realize <em>who and what we are</em> we then begin to build our own world even as God builds His.—<em>From Title-page</em>.</p>
<p>It unfolds the secret of our underlying strength, and shows what it is that gives us power to fulfil the real and living purposes of our being.—<em>The New Christianity</em>.</p>
<p>Every Living Creature.</p>
<p>The tender and humane passion in the human heart is too precious a quality to allow it to be hardened or effaced by practices such as we so often indulge in.—<em>From Title-page</em>.</p>
<p>An eloquent appeal and an able argument for justice and mercy to our dumb fellow-creatures. A good book for those whose characters are being formed, and for all who love justice and right.—<em>Religio-Philosophical Journal</em>.</p>
<p>Character-Building Thought Power,</p>
<p>A thought, good or evil, an act, in time a habit, so runs life's law; what you live in your thought-world, that, sooner or later, you will find objectified in your life.—<em>From Title-page</em>.</p>
<p>In "Character-Building Thought Power" Mr. Trine demonstrates the power of mental habits, and show how by daily effort we may train ourselves into right ways of thinking and acting. His teachings are sound, practical, and of priceless worth.—<em>Albany Press</em>.</p>

<p>What All The World's A-Seeking.</p>
<p>Its purpose is distinctly practical. It is most fascinatingly written, and deserves the remarkable success it has achieved.—<em>The Review of Reviews</em>.</p>
<p>The volume abounds in passages of great beauty and strength; but the striking feature of the book is, after all, the solid, sensible, healthy exposition of the one theme it is written to enforce.—<em>New York Independent</em>.</p>
<p>This is a book among a thousand for its inspiring message, and is eminently worthy of a vast audience. You will miss much if you miss reading its truth-laden pages.—<em>Cumberland Presbyterian</em>.</p>
<p>In Tune With the Infinite</p>
<p>It is one of the simplest, clearest works ever written, dealing with the power of the interior forces in moulding the every-day conditions of life.—<em>San Francisco Bulletin</em>.</p>
<p>. . . It immediately suggests the works of Drummond, but shows a decided advance upon the ground which he made familiar to mankind; it not only reveals the author's recognition of spiritual law, but in certain instances shows his rare and remarkable understanding of the nature and action of such law; the preface alone shows his high intuition, and the book proves his ability to achieve his purpose in a marvellous degree.—<em>Boston Daily Evening Transcript</em>.</p>
<p>Mr. Trine can write well upon such topics as this. He is alive, vigorous, cheery, confident. The work has distinctiveness in its style and method.—<em>The Literary World, London</em>.</p>
<p><em>The above books are beautifully and durably bound<br />
in gray-green raised cloth, stamped in deep<br />
old-green and gold, with gilt top.<br />
Price, 1.25 per volume</em>.</p>
