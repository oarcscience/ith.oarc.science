### PART TWO

<div style="font-size: 90%">

TELLS how and why the operations of the mind are carried on by two
parallel modes of activity, the one conscious and the other
subconscious. It explains why the thought processes of the subconscious
are the theatre of the most important mental phenomena, why ease and
perfection depend entirely upon the degree in which we cease to depend
upon the consciousness. It explains the origin of all great, noble,
brilliant thoughts and ideas, why we find ourselves sometimes endowed
with tact, instinct, courage, sagacity and inspiration. In fact, it
tells of a vast mental storehouse in which ninety per cent. of our
thought processes originate it explains also how this vast mental
storehouse may be placed under the supervision and in the keeping of the
conscious mind. It tells why those who are familiar with the laws
governing in this larger mental domain are enabled to accomplish, to
achieve, to become writers, authors, artists, ministers, captains of
industry, and why all others must necessarily remain less than ten per
cent. efficient.

#### INTRODUCTION. PART TWO

Our difficulties are largely due to confused ideas and ignorance of our
true interests. The great task is to discover the laws of Nature to
which we are to adjust ourselves. Clear thinking and moral insight are,
therefore, of incalculable value. All processes, even those of thought,
rest on solid foundations.

The keener the sensibilities, the more acute the judgment, the more
delicate the taste, the more refined the moral feelings, the more subtle
the intelligence, the loftier the aspiration—the purer and more intense
are the gratifications which existence yields. Hence it is that the
study of the best that has been thought in the world gives supreme
pleasure.

The powers, uses and possibilities of the mind under the new
interpretations are incomparably more wonderful than the most
extravagant accomplishment, or even dreams of material progress. Thought
is energy. Active thought is active energy; concentrated thought is
concentrated energy. Thought concentrated on a definite purpose becomes
power. This is the power which is being used by those who do not believe
in the virtue of poverty, or the beauty of self-denial. They perceive
that this is the talk of weaklings.

The ability to receive and manifest this power depends upon the ability
to recognize the Infinite Energy ever dwelling in man, constantly
creating and re-creating his body and mind, and ready at any moment to
manifest through him in any needful manner. In exact proportion to the
recognition of this truth will be the manifestation in the outer life of
the individual.

Part Two explains the method by which this is accomplished.

<span id="page_17">p. 17</span>

#### PART TWO

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_II:1">II, 1</span></span>1. The
operations of the mind are produced by two parallel modes of activity,
the one conscious, and the other subconscious. Prof. Davidson says: "He
who thinks to illuminate the whole range of mental action by the light
of his own consciousness is not unlike one who should go about to
illuminate the universe with a rushlight."

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_II:2">II, 2</span></span>2. The
subconscious, logical processes are carried on with a certainty and
regularity which would be impossible if there existed the possibility of
error. Our mind is so designed that it prepares for us the most
important foundations of cognition, whilst we have not the slightest
apprehension of the modus operandi.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_II:3">II, 3</span></span>3. The
subconscious soul, like a benevolent stranger, works and makes provision
for our benefit, pouring only the mature fruit into our lap; thus
ultimate analysis of thought processes shows that the subconscious is
the theatre of the most important mental phenomena.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_II:4">II, 4</span></span>4. It is
through the subconscious that Shakespeare must have perceived, without
effort, great truths which are hidden from the conscious mind of the
student; that Phidias fashioned marble and bronze; that Raphael painted
Madonnas and Beethoven composed symphonies.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_II:5">II, 5</span></span>5. Ease and
perfection depend entirely upon the degree in which we cease to depend
upon

<span id="page_18">p. 18</span>

the consciousness; playing the piano, skating, operating the typewriter,
the skilled trades, depend for their perfect execution on the process of
the subconscious mind. The marvel of playing a brilliant piece on the
piano, while at the same time conducting a vigorous conversation, shows
the greatness of our subconscious powers.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_II:6">II, 6</span></span>6. We are
all aware how dependent we are upon the subconscious, and the greater,
the nobler, the more brilliant our thoughts are, the more it is obvious
to ourselves that the origin lies beyond our ken. We find ourselves
endowed with tact, instinct, sense of the beautiful in art, music, etc.,
of whose origin or dwelling-place we are wholly unconscious.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_II:7">II, 7</span></span>7. The
value of the subconscious is enormous; it inspires us; it warns us; it
furnishes us with names, facts and scenes from the storehouse of memory.
It directs our thoughts, tastes, and accomplishes tasks so intricate
that no conscious mind, even if it had the power, has the capacity for.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_II:8">II, 8</span></span>8. We can
walk at will; we can raise the arm whenever we choose to do so; we can
give our attention through eye or ear to any subject at pleasure. On the
other hand, we cannot stop our heartbeats nor the circulation of the
blood, nor the growth of stature, nor the formationJof nerve and muscle
tissue, nor the building

<span id="page_19">p. 19</span>

of the bones, nor many other important vital processes.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_II:9">II, 9</span></span>9. If we
compare these two sets of action, the one decreed by the will of the
moment, and the other proceeding in majestic, rhythmic course, subject
to no vacillation, but constant at every moment, we stand in awe of the
latter, and ask to have the mystery explained. We see at once that these
are the vital processes of our physical life, and we cannot avoid the
inference that these all-important functions are designedly withdrawn
from the domain of our outward will with its variations and transitions,
and placed under the direction of a permanent and dependable power
within us.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_II:10">II, 10</span></span>10. Of
these two powers, the outward and changeable has been termed the
"Conscious Mind," or the "Objective Mind" (dealing with outward objects)
. The interior power is called the "Subconscious Mind," or the
"Subjective Mind," and besides its work on the mental plane it controls
the regular functions which make physical life possible.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_II:11">II, 11</span></span>11. It is
necessary to have a clear understanding of their . respective functions
on the mental plane, as well as of certain other basic principles.
Perceiving and operating through the five physical senses, the conscious
mind deals with the impressions and objects of the outward life.

<span id="page_20">p. 20</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_II:12">II, 12</span></span>12. It
has the faculty of discrimination, carrying with it the responsibility
of choice. It has the power of reasoning whether inductive, deductive,
analytical or syllogistic, and this power may be developed to a high
degree. It is the seat of the will, with all the energies that flow
therefrom.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_II:13">II, 13</span></span>13. Not
only can it impress other minds, but it can direct the subconscious
mind. In this way the conscious mind becomes the responsible ruler and
guardian of the subconscious mind. It is this high function which can
completely reverse conditions in your life.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_II:14">II, 14</span></span>14. It is
often true that conditions of fear, worry, poverty, disease, inharmony
and evils of all kinds dominate us by reason of false suggestions
accepted by the unguarded subconscious mind. All this the trained
conscious mind can entirely prevent by its vigilant protective action.
It may properly be called "the watchman at the gate" of the great
subconscious domain.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_II:15">II, 15</span></span>15. One
writer has expressed the chief distinction between the two phases of
mind thus:

"Conscious mind is reasoning will. Subconscious mind is instinctive
desire, the result of past reasoning will."

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_II:16">II, 16</span></span>16. The
subconscious mind draws just and accurate inferences from premises
furnished from outside sources. Where the premise is

<span id="page_21">p. 21</span>

true, the subconscious mind reaches a faultless conclusion, but where
the premise or suggestion is an error the whole structure falls. The
subconscious mind does not engage in the process of proving. It relies
upon the conscious mind, "the watchman at the gate," to guard it from
mistaken impressions.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_II:17">II, 17</span></span>17.
Receiving any suggestions as true, the subconscious mind at once
proceeds to act thereon in the whole domain of its tremendous field of
work. The conscious mind can suggest either truth or error. If the
latter, it is at the cost of wide-reaching peril to the whole being.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_II:18">II, 18</span></span>18. The
conscious mind ought to be on duty during every waking hour. When the
"watchman" is "off guard," or when its calm judgment is suspended, under
a variety of circumstances, then the subconscious mind is unguarded and
left open to suggestion from all sources. During the wild excitement of
panic, or during the height of anger, or the impulses of the
irresponsible mob, or at any other time of unrestrained passion, the
conditions are most dangerous. The subconscious mind is then open to the
suggestion of fear, hatred, selfishness, greed, self-depreciation and
other negative forces, derived from surrounding persons or
circumstances. The result is usually unwholesome in the extreme, with
effects that may endure to distress it for a long time. Hence the

<span id="page_22">p. 22</span>

great importance of guarding the subconscious mind from false
impressions.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_II:19">II, 19</span></span>19. The
subconscious mind perceives by intuition. Hence its processes are rapid.
It does not wait for the slow methods of conscious reasoning. In fact,
it cannot employ them.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_II:20">II, 20</span></span>20. The
subconscious mind never sleeps, never rests, any more than does your
heart, or your blood. It has been found that by plainly stating to the
subconscious mind certain specific things to be accomplished, forces are
set in operation that lead to the result desired. Here, then, is a
source of power which places us in touch with Omnipotence. Herein is a
deep principle which is well worth our most earnest study.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_II:21">II, 21</span></span>21. The
operation of this law is interesting. Those who put it into operation
find that when they go out to meet the person with whom they anticipate
a difficult interview, to! something has been there before them and
dissolved the supposed differences; everything is changed; all is
harmonious; they find that when some difficult business problem presents
itself they can afford to make delay and something suggests the proper
solution; everything is properly arranged; in fact, those who have
learned to trust the subconscious find that they have infinite resources
at their command.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_II:22">II, 22</span></span>22. The
subconscious mind is the seat of

<span id="page_23">p. 23</span>

our principles and our aspirations. It is the fount of our artistic and
altruistic ideals. These instincts can only be overthrown by an
elaborate and gradual process of undermining the innate principles.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_II:23">II, 23</span></span>23. The
subconscious mind cannot argue controversially. Hence, if it has
accepted wrong suggestions, the sure method of overcoming them is by the
use of a strong counter-suggestion, frequently repeated, which the mind
must accept, thus eventually forming new and healthy habits of thought
and life, for the subconscious mind is the seat of Habit. That which we
do over and over becomes mechanical; it is no longer an act of judgment,
but has worn its deep grooves in the subconscious mind. This is
favourable for us if the habit be wholesome and right. If it be harmful
and wrong, the remedy is to recognize the omnipotence of the
subconscious mind and suggest present actual freedom. The subconscious
being creative and one with our divine source will at once create the
freedom suggested.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_II:24">II, 24</span></span>24. To
sum up: The normal functions of the subconscious on the physical side
have to do with the regular and vital processes, with the preservation
of life and the restoration of health; with the care of offspring, which
includes an instinctive desire to preserve all life and improve
conditions generally.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_II:25">II, 25</span></span>25. On
the mental side, it is the storehouse

<span id="page_24">p. 24</span>

of memory; it harbours the wonderful thought messengers, who work,
unhampered by time or space; it is the fountain of the practical
initiative and constructive forces of life: It is the seat of habit.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_II:26">II, 26</span></span>26. On
the spiritual side, it is the source of ideals, of aspiration, of the
imagination, and is the channel through which we recognize our Divine
Source, and in proportion as we recognize this divinity do we come into
an understanding of the source of power.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_II:27">II, 27</span></span>27.
Someone may ask: "How can the subconscious change conditions?" The reply
is, because the subconscious is a part of the Universal Mind and a part
must be the same in kind and quality as the whole; the only difference
is one of degree. The whole, as we know, is creative; in fact, it is the
only creator there is; consequently we find that mind is creative, and
as thought is the only activity which the mind possesses thought must
necessarily be creative also.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_II:28">II, 28</span></span>28. But
we shall find that there is a vast difference between simply thinking
and directing our thought consciously, systematically and
constructively; when we do this we place our mind in harmony with the
Universal Mind, we come in tune with the Infinite, we set in operation
the mightiest force in existence, the creative power of the Universal
Mind. This, as everything else, is governed by natural law, and this

<span id="page_25">p. 25</span>

law is the "Law of Attraction," which is that Mind is creative, and will
automatically correlate with its object and bring it into manifestation.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_II:29">II, 29</span></span>29. In
Part One I gave you an exercise for the purpose of securing control of
the physical body; if you have accomplished this you are ready to
advance. This time you will begin to control your thought. Always take
the same room, the same chair, and the same position, if possible. In
some cases it is not convenient to take the same room: in this case
simply make the best use of such conditions as may be available. Now be
perfectly still as before, but inhibit all thought; this will give you
control over all thoughts of care, worry and fear, and will . enable you
to entertain only the kind of thoughts you desire. Continue this
exercise until you gain complete mastery.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_II:30">II, 30</span></span>30. You
will not be able to do this for more than a few moments at a time, but
the exercise is valuable, because it will be a very practical
demonstration of the great number of thoughts which are constantly
trying to gain access to your mental world.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_II:31">II, 31</span></span>31. In
Part Three you will receive instructions for an exercise which may be a
little more interesting, but it is necessary that you master this one
first.
