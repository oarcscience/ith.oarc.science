### PART EIGHT

<div style="font-size: 90%">

THIS Part tells of the creative principle of the Universe, what it is,
how it takes form and how it is brought into manifestation. This
principle being the underlying principle of all existence must
necessarily be governed by an immutable law. It tells how the character,
health and circumstances of the individual are formed, and suggests
methods whereby desirable conditions and circumstances may be created.
It tells how and why and when the material from which your future is to
emerge is secured. It suggests methods and exercises by which you may
secure complete control of the power which governs in this mighty field
of action. Mighty because it is the most important work which any
individual can undertake. We are making our future now, to-day, when it
comes we shall have to accept what is given, it will be too late to
change it, but we can dominate it, control it, make it what we want it
to be, and this Part explains how.

#### INTRODUCTION. PART EIGHT

In this Part you will find that you may freely choose what you think,
but the result of your thought is governed by an immutable law! Is not
this a wonderful thought? Is it not wonderful to know that our lives are
not subject to caprice or variability of any kind? That they are
governed by law. This stability is our opportunity, because by complying
with the law we can secure the desired effect with invariable precision.

It is the Law which makes the Universe one grand pan of Harmony. If it
were not for law, the Universe would be a Chaos instead of a Cosmos.

Here, then, is the secret of the origin of both good and evil: this is
all the good and evil there ever was or ever will be.

Let me illustrate. Thought results in action. If your thought is
constructive and harmonious, the result will be good: if your thought is
destructive or inharmonious, the result will be evil.

There is therefore but one law, one principle, one cause, one Source of
Power, and good and evil are simply words which have been coined to
indicate the result of our action, or our compliance or non-compliance
with this law.

The importance of this is well illustrated in the lives of Emerson and
Carlyle. Emerson loved the good and his life was a symphony of peace and
harmony; Carlyle hated the bad, and his life was a record of perpetual
discord and inharmony.

Here we have two grand men, each intent upon achieving the same ideal,
but one makes use of constructive thought and is therefore in harmony
with Natural Law, the other makes use of destructive thought and
therefore brings upon himself discord of every kind and character.

It is evident therefore that we are to hate nothing, not even the "bad,"
because hatred is destructive, and we shall soon find that by
entertaining destructive thought we are sowing the "wind" and shall reap
the "whirlwind."

#### PART EIGHT

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_VIII:1">VIII, 1</span></span>1.
Thought contains a vital principle, because it is the creative principle
of the Universe and by its nature will combine with other similar
thoughts.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_VIII:2">VIII, 2</span></span>2. As
the one purpose of life is growth, all principle underlying existence
must contribute to give it effect. Thought, therefore, takes form and
the law of growth eventually brings it into manifestation.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_VIII:3">VIII, 3</span></span>3. You
may freely choose what you think, but the result of your thought is
governed by an immutable law. Any line of thought persisted in cannot
fail to produce its result in the character, health and circumstances of
the individual. Methods whereby we can substitute habits of constructive
thinking for those which we have found produce only undesirable effects
are therefore of primary importance.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_VIII:4">VIII, 4</span></span>4. We
all know that this is by no means easy. Mental habits are difficult to
control, but it can be done and the way to do it is to begin at once to
substitute constructive thought for destructive thought. Form the habit
of analysing every thought. If it is necessary, if its manifestation in
the objective will be a benefit, not only to yourself, but to all whom
it may affect in any way, keep it; treasure it; it is of value; it is in
tune with the Infinite; it will grow and develop and produce fruit an
hundredfold. On the other hand, it will be well for you to keep this
quotation from George

<span id="page_98">p. 98</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Matthews Adams in
mind, "Learn to keep the door shut, keep out of your mind, out of your
office, and out of your world, every element that seeks admittance with
no definite helpful end in view."

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_VIII:5">VIII, 5</span></span>5. If
your thought has been critical or destructive, and has resulted in any
condition of discord or inharmony in your environment, it may be
necessary for you to cultivate a mental attitude which will be conducive
to constructive thought.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_VIII:6">VIII, 6</span></span>6. The
imagination will be found to be a great assistance in this direction;
the cultivation of the imagination leads to the development of the ideal
out of which your future will emerge.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_VIII:7">VIII, 7</span></span>7. The
imagination gathers up the material by which the Mind weaves the fabric
in which your future is to be clothed.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_VIII:8">VIII, 8</span></span>8.
Imagination is the light by which we can penetrate new worlds of thought
and experience.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_VIII:9">VIII, 9</span></span>9.
Imagination is the mighty instrument by which every discoverer, every
inventor, opened the way from precedent to experience. Precedent said,
"It cannot be done"; experience said, "It is done."

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_VIII:10">VIII, 10</span></span>10.
Imagination is a plastic power, moulding the things of sense into new
forms and ideals.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_VIII:11">VIII, 11</span></span>11.
Imagination is the constructive form

<span id="page_99">p. 99</span>

of thought which must precede every constructive form of action.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_VIII:12">VIII, 12</span></span>12. A
builder cannot build a structure of any kind until he has first received
the plans from the architect, and the architect must get them from his
imagination.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_VIII:13">VIII, 13</span></span>13.
The Captain of Industry cannot build a giant corporation which may
co-ordinate hundreds of smaller firms and thousands of employees, and
utilize millions of capital until he has first created the entire work
in his imagination. Objects in the material world are as clay in the
potter's hand; it is in the Master Mind that the real things are
created, and it is by the use of the imagination that the work is done.
In order to cultivate the imagination it must be exercised. Exercise is
necessary to cultivate mental muscle as well as physical muscle. It must
be supplied with nourishment or it cannot grow.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_VIII:14">VIII, 14</span></span>14.
Do not confuse Imagination with Fancy, or that form of day dreaming in
which some people like to indulge. Day dreaming is a form of mental
dissipation which may lead to mental disaster.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_VIII:15">VIII, 15</span></span>15.
Constructive imagination means mental labour, by some considered to be
the hardest kind of labour, but, if so, it yields the greatest returns,
for all the great things in life have come to men and women who had the
capacity to

<span id="page_100">p. 100</span>

think, to imagine, and to make their dreams come true.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_VIII:16">VIII, 16</span></span>16.
When you have become thoroughly conscious of the fact that Mind is the
only creative principle, that it is Omnipotent, Omniscient and
Omnipresent, and that you can consciously come into harmony with this
Omnipotence through your power of thought, you will have taken a long
step in the right direction.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_VIII:17">VIII, 17</span></span>17.
The next step is to place yourself in position to receive this power. As
it is Omnipresent, it must be within you. We know that this is so
because we know that all power is from within, but it must be developed,
unfolded, cultivated; in order to do this we must be receptive, and this
receptivity is acquired just as physical strength is gained, by
exercise.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_VIII:18">VIII, 18</span></span>18.
The law of attraction will certainly and unerringly bring to you the
conditions, environment, and experiences in life, corresponding with
your habitual, characteristic, predominant mental attitude. Not what you
think once in a while when you are in church, or have just read a good
book, but your predominant mental attitude is what counts.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_VIII:19">VIII, 19</span></span>19.
You cannot entertain weak, harmful, negative thoughts ten hours a day
and expect to bring about beautiful, strong and harmonious conditions by
ten minutes of strong, positive, creative thought.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_VIII:20">VIII, 20</span></span>20.
Real power comes from within. All

<span id="page_101">p. 101</span>

power that anybody can possibly use is within man, only waiting to be
brought into visibility by his first recognizing it, and then affirming
it as his, working it into his consciousness until he becomes one with
it.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_VIII:21">VIII, 21</span></span>21.
People say that they desire abundant life, and so they do, but so many
interpret this to mean that if they will exercise their muscles or
breathe scientifically, eat certain foods in certain ways, drink so many
glasses of water every day, of just a certain temperature, keep out of
draughts, they will attain the abundant life they seek. The result of
such methods is but indifferent. However, when man awakens to the truth,
and affirms his oneness with all Life, he finds that he takes on the
clear eye, the elastic step, the vigour of youth; he finds that he has
discovered the source of all power.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_VIII:22">VIII, 22</span></span>22.
All mistakes are but the mistakes of ignorance. Knowledge gaining and
consequent power is what determines growth and evolution. The
recognition and demonstration of knowledge is what constitutes power,
and this power is spiritual power, and this spiritual power is the power
which lies at the heart of all things; it is the soul of the universe.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_VIII:23">VIII, 23</span></span>23.
This knowledge is the result of man's ability to think; thought is
therefore the germ of man's conscious evolution. When man ceases to
advance in his thoughts and ideals, his forces immediately begin to
disintegrate

<span id="page_102">p. 102</span>

and his countenance gradually registers these changing conditions.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_VIII:24">VIII, 24</span></span>24.
Successful men make it their business to hold ideals of the conditions
which they wish to realize. They constantly hold in mind the next step
necessary to the ideal for which they are striving. Thoughts are the
materials with which they build, and the imagination is their mental
work-shop. Mind is the ever moving force with which they secure the
persons and circumstances necessary to build their success structure,
and imagination is the matrix in which all great things are fashioned.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_VIII:25">VIII, 25</span></span>25.
If you have been faithful to your ideal, you will hear the call when
circumstances are ready to materialize your plans and results will
correspond in the exact ratio of your fidelity to your ideal. The ideal
steadily held is what pre-determines and attracts the necessary
conditions for its fulfilment.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_VIII:26">VIII, 26</span></span>26.
It is thus that you may weave a garment of spirit and power into the web
of your entire existence; it is thus that you may lead a charmed life
and be for ever protected from all harm; it is thus that you may become
a positive force whereby conditions of opulence and harmony may be
attracted to you.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_VIII:27">VIII, 27</span></span>27.
This is the leaven which is gradually permeating the general
consciousness and is largely responsible for the conditions of unrest
which are everywhere evident.

<span id="page_103">p. 103</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_VIII:28">VIII, 28</span></span>28.
In your last exercise you created a mental image, you brought it from
the invisible into the visible; now I want you to take an object and
follow it back to its origination, see of what it really consists. If
you do this you will develop imagination, insight, perception, and
sagacity. These come not by the superficial observation of the
multitude, but by a keen analytical observation which sees below the
surface.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_VIII:29">VIII, 29</span></span>29.
It is the few who know that the things which they see are only effects,
and understand the causes by which these effects were brought into
existence.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_VIII:30">VIII, 30</span></span>30.
Take the same position as heretofore and visualize a Battleship; see the
grim monster floating on the surface of the water; there appears to be
no life anywhere about; all is silence; you know that by far the largest
part of the vessel is under water; out of sight; you know that the ship
is as large and as heavy as a twenty-story skyscraper or the National
Gallery; you know that there are hundreds of men ready to spring to
their appointed task instantly; you know that every department is in
charge of able, trained, skilled officers who have proven themselves
competent to take charge of this marvellous piece of mechanism; you know
that although it lies apparently oblivious to everything else, it has
eyes which see everything for miles around, and nothing is permitted to
escape its watchful vision;

<span id="page_104">p. 104</span>

you know that while it appears quiet, submissive and innocent, it is
prepared to hurl a steel projectile weighing thousands of pounds at an
enemy many miles away; this and much more you can bring to mind with
comparatively no effort whatever. But how did the battleship come to be
where it is; how did it come into existence in the first place? All of
this you want to know if you are a careful observer.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_VIII:31">VIII, 31</span></span>31.
Follow the great steel plates through the foundries, see the thousands
of men employed in their production; go still further back, and see the
ore as it comes from the mine, see it loaded on barges or trucks, see it
melted and properly treated; go back still further and see the architect
and engineers who planned the vessel; let the thought carry you back
still further in order to determine why they planned the vessel; you
will see that you are now so far back that the vessel is something
intangible, it no longer exists, it is now only a thought existing in
the brain of the architect; but from where did the order come to plan
the vessel? Probably from the Secretary of War or the First Lord of the
Admiralty; probably this vessel was planned long before war was thought
of, and Parliament or Congress had to pass a bill appropriating the
money; possibly there was opposition, and speeches for or against the
bill. Whom do these Members of Parliament or these Congressmen
represent? They represent you and me,

<span id="page_105">p. 105</span>

so that our line of thought begins with the Battleship and ends with
ourselves, and we find in the last analysis that our own thought is
responsible for this and many other things, of which we seldom think,
and a little further reflection will develop the most important fact of
all, and that is, if someone had not discovered the law by which this
tremendous mass of steel and iron could be made to float upon the water,
instead of immediately going to the bottom, the battleship could not
have come into existence at all.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_VIII:32">VIII, 32</span></span>32.
This law is that, "the specific gravity of any substance is the weight
of any volume of it, compared with an equal volume of water." The
discovery of this law revolutionized every kind of ocean travel,
commerce and warfare, and made the existence of the battleship possible.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_VIII:33">VIII, 33</span></span>33.
You will find exercises of this kind invaluable. When the thought has
been trained to look below the surface everything takes on a different
appearance, the insignificant becomes significant, the uninteresting
interesting; the things which we supposed to be of no importance are
seen to be the only really vital things in existence.
