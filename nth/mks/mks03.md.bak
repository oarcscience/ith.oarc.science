### THE MASTER KEY PSYCHOLOGICAL CHART

It is a psychological fact that ninety per cent. of our mental power is
never or seldom used. Therefore, most men have the power to achieve ten
times as much as they ever accomplish.

This chart will tell you exactly where you stand, what you are
accomplishing and what you can accomplish if you make the necessary
effort.

Copy the following table out and fill it in as instructed below .

<div align="center">

|                     |     |            |
|---------------------|-----|------------|
| Mental Product      |     | %          |
| Health              |     | %          |
| Time Efficiency     |     | %          |
| Creative Power      |     | %          |
| Concentration       |     | %          |
|                     |     | \_\_\_\_\_ |
| Total               |     | %          |
| Divide by 5—Average |     | %          |

The first test is your Mental product. What is it worth? Are you getting
full value for it? What you get for your mental product depends entirely
upon your ability to sell it to the best advantage. The chances are that
many men with no more ability than yourself are being paid ten, twenty
or fifty times more than you are, for a product no better than yours. If
so, there is a reason, and this chart will explain it.

Estimate the value of what you have to sell, your knowledge, your
experience, your loyalty, your energy, and if you are marketing it at
its full rate value give yourself 100 per cent.;

<span id="page_xlviii">p. xlviii</span>

if you are only getting one-half of what it is worth give yourself fifty
per cent., but be fair; do not underestimate the value of what you have
to offer; remember that loss leads to greater loss and most loss comes
from self-depreciation. Cause and effect do not operate somewhere,
sometimes, but everywhere, always. This is an invariable law, so that
whatever we receive, good or bad, is the result of a definite cause and
reaches us either as a penalty or a reward.

And remember this, your ability to sell your mental product as the rate
of 5 per cent. annually, on $100,000, does not depend upon ability or
knowledge either; you may be selling your product for $400 a year, and
it may be more valuable than that of many who are being paid at the rate
of $5,000 a year. The reason is plain. Knowledge does not apply itself;
you are allowing it to remain in static form; you must convert it into
dynamic form by applying creative power and concentration. The lack of
concentrated, intelligent, charted effort may be costing you $4,000 a
year.

Next, take Health. If you eat well, sleep well, take a reasonable amount
of recreation, and can attend to your business, profession or household
duties without any consideration for or thought of the state of your
health, give yourself 100 per cent.; but if your body needs constant
attention, if you have to be continually

<span id="page_xlix">p. xlix</span>

worried about what to eat or what not to eat, if you cannot sleep, or if
you have aches or pains of any description, deduct from the 100 per
cent.; if you think your health is 90 per cent. of what it should be,
give yourself 90 per cent., or if you are only 50 per cent. efficient,
put it down—be absolutely fair.

Remember that your physical body is maintained through a process of
continuous destruction and reconstruction. Life is simply an exchange of
the old for the new, and health is only the equilibrium which nature
maintains during the process of creating new tissue and eliminating the
old or waste tissue.

Birth and death are constantly taking place in our body, new cells are
constantly being formed by the process of converting food, water and air
into living tissue. Every action of the brain, every movement of a
muscle means the destruction and consequent death of some of these cells
and the accumulation of these dead, unused and waste cells is what
causes pain, suffering and disease. The symptoms depend upon what organs
are being taxed in their effort to eliminate the waste matter.

An understanding of these laws and a consequent knowledge as to how to
preserve an equilibrium between the new cells which are being created
and the old cells which are being eliminated is the secret of perfect
health.

Next in importance comes Time Efficiency

<span id="page_l">p. l</span>

because time is all that we have, and what we accomplish depends
entirely upon what use we make of our time. If you work eight hours,
sleep eight hours, and use eight hours for recreation, study and
self-improvement and all the time is fully utilized, give yourself 100
per cent.

But if any part of the eight hours which should be sold at a profit is
spent in idleness, or gossip, or any form of mental dissipation; if any
part of this time is wasted, or worse than wasted by allowing your
thought to rest on critical, discordant or inharmonious subjects of any
kind, cut down your percentage accordingly. If you fall asleep the
minute your head touches the pillow, all right, but if you spend from
fifteen minutes to an hour trying to get to sleep, cut your percentage
down again: if your sleep is disturbed by dreams or fear or worry of any
kind, cut your percentage down again.

If you jump up early and feel refreshed and vigorous, if you bathe and
make your toilet without the loss of any unnecessary time, well and
good, but if you idle or dream or fritter away from fifteen minutes to a
half-hour needlessly, cut your percentage down again. If you spend the
rest of your time in good healthy recreation, which benefits you, both
physically and mentally, well and good; you are acquiring capital which
will have a cash value, but if you let the time get away from you with
nothing

<span id="page_li">p. li</span>

to show for it, you are not better physically, mentally or morally; if
the time has gone and left nothing of value, then it has been lost for
it may leave something detrimental, something which will prove a
handicap in your race for success. Here again you must be fair with
yourself and give yourself exactly the percentage to which you are
entitled.

Next comes your Creative Power. If most persons whom you meet do what
you want them to do; if they feel toward you as you wish them to feel;
if they think what you want them to think, give yourself 100 per cent.,
because everything we get must come from others; there is no other
channel by which success can reach us. This creative power must be
unconsciously exercised, it must be your personality; if, however, you
have to make a tremendous effort when you wish to accomplish something,
if you have to exert will power, if you must fret and worry and stew
over the result of an important interview, cut your percentage down to
50 per cent. or 40 per cent. or even less, because you do not understand
the principle involved.

When you understand there will be no cause for anxiety; you will know,
because in the first place you will never want or expect anyone to do
anything except what is best for them; you will understand that every
transaction must benefit both parties. When you understand

<span id="page_lii">p. lii</span>

these laws, when the principles become a vital part of your life, when
they are involved in your mental attitude, you will have found the
Master Key and all doors will be open to you, because you will
understand that every event, every condition, every thing was first an
idea, and that just to the extent that you grew quiet, and focussed your
attention on that idea, stilling all the activities of the mind, and
eliminating all other thoughts from your consciousness, will the various
phases and possibilities of the idea develop; and just in accordance
with the definiteness with which you picture that idea, and the extent
with which the idea takes possession of you will the creative power do
its work, and the creative power will eventually take control and direct
every activity of both mind and body and will begin to shape every
condition related to the idea, so that sooner or later the idea will
come forth in definite tangible form. If you understand this thoroughly,
and have demonstrated it time and time again, so that you can mould and
shape and determine conditions, I say again, give yourself 100 per cent.

Next comes Concentration. Can you concentrate? Do you know what it means
to concentrate? Can you direct the thought to any problem which may
arise, for five minutes, ten minutes or fifteen minutes, to the absolute
exclusion of everything else? Can you unravel, disintegrate, take the
problem apart, see every phase of it, see the cause which brought it

<span id="page_liii">p. liii</span>

about, see the solution, see it definitely, conclusively, and finally,
and know that your solution is correct? Can you then dismiss the matter
and turn your attention to something else without ever recurring to the
matter again? If you can do this, give yourself 100 per cent. If,
however, you are haunted by fears, troubles, anxieties. If, when you
have no problem to solve, you make one for yourself, by drawing on your
imagination; if you are afraid of what this one says, or the other one
thinks, or someone else does, then cut down your percentage, because if
you knew how to concentrate you would not be afraid of anyone or
anything; you would be in possession of a power which would make every
other known power sink into insignificance. Be careful to give yourself
exactly the percentage to which you feel you are entitled.

Now strike an average. See where you stand. If you are a little above
the average, your chart will be something like this

<div align="center">

|                     |     |            |
|---------------------|-----|------------|
| Mental Product      |     | 50%        |
| Health              |     | 80%        |
| Time Efficiency     |     | 80%        |
| Creative Power      |     | 50%        |
| Concentration       |     | 10%        |
|                     |     | \_\_\_\_\_ |
| Total               |     | 270%       |
| Divide by 5—Average |     | 54%        |

</div>

Assuming that you are earning $1,000 a year

<span id="page_liv">p. liv</span>

and that you feel that your mental product should be worth $2,000 a
year, which is the basis for your calculation, then any method which
would assist you to increase your earning power to $2,000 a year would
be worth $1,000 a year to you.

Again, any method which would bring you health, efficiency in your time,
efficiency in your creative power, or increase your ability to
concentrate, would be worth at least $1,000 a year. Many have found that
the Master Key teaching does all of this and much more.
