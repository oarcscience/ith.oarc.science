### PART ELEVEN

<div style="font-size: 90%">

THIS Part tells of the means by which we have discovered that the
infinitely small as well as the infinitely large is in the last analysis
nothing but force, motion, life and mind. It tells of the process by
which we have become familiar with the vast organization by which we are
identified with the complex operations of Nature. It gives concise
directions for making use of the creative power of the Universe, the
power by which all things are brought into existence. It shows how this
marvellous power may be utilized, directed and made available for the
solution of every human problem.

#### INTRODUCTION. PART ELEVEN

Your life is governed by law, by actual, immutable principles that never
vary. Law is in operation at all times; in all places.

Fixed laws underlie all human actions. For this reason, men who control
giant industries are enabled to determine with absolute precision just
what percentage of every hundred thousand people will respond to any
given set of conditions.

It is well, however, to remember that while every effect is the result
of a cause, the effect in turn becomes a cause, which creates other
effects, which in turn create still other causes; so that when you put
the law of attraction into operation you must remember that you are
starting a train of causation for good or otherwise which may have
endless possibilities.

We frequently hear it said, "A very distressing situation came into my
life, which could not have been the result of my thought, as I certainly
never entertained any thought which could have such a result." We fail
to remember that like attracts like in the mental world, and that the
thought which we entertain brings to us certain friendships,
companionships of a particular kind, and these in turn bring about
conditions and environment, which in turn are responsible for the
conditions of which we complain.

#### PART ELEVEN

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_XI:1">XI, 1</span></span>1.
Inductive reasoning is the process of the objective mind by which we
compare a number of separate instances with one another until we see the
common factor that gives rise to them all.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_XI:2">XI, 2</span></span>2.
Induction proceeds by comparison of facts; it is this method of studying
nature which has resulted in the discovery of a reign of law which has
marked an epoch in human progress.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_XI:3">XI, 3</span></span>3. It is
the dividing line between superstition and intelligence; it has
eliminated the elements of uncertainty and caprice from men's lives and
substituted law, reason and certitude.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_XI:4">XI, 4</span></span>4. It is
the "Watchman at the Gate" mentioned in a former Part.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_XI:5">XI, 5</span></span>5. When, by
virtue of this principle, the world to which the senses were accustomed,
has been revolutionized; when the sun has been arrested in his course,
the apparently flat earth has been shaped into a ball and set whirling
around him; when the inert matter has been resolved into active
elements, and the universe presents itself wherever we direct the
telescope and microscope, full of force, motion and life; we are
constrained to ask by what possible means the delicate forms of
organization in the midst of it are kept in order and repair.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_XI:6">XI, 6</span></span>6. Like
poles and like forces repel themselves or remain impenetrable to each
other, and

<span id="page_140">p. 140</span>

this cause seems in general sufficient to assign a proper place and
distance to stars, men and forces. As men of different virtues enter
into partnership, so do opposite poles attract each other; elements that
have no property in common like acids and gases cling to each other in
preference and a general exchange is kept up between the surplus and the
demand.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_XI:7">XI, 7</span></span>7. As the
eye seeks and receives satisfaction from colours complementary to those
which are given, so do need, want and desire, in the largest sense,
induce, guide and determine action.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_XI:8">XI, 8</span></span>8. It is
our privilege to become conscious of the principle and act in accordance
with it. Cuvier sees a tooth belonging to an extinct race of animals.
This tooth wants a body for the performance of its function, and it
defines the peculiar body it stands in need of with such precision that
Cuvier is able to reconstruct the frame of this animal.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_XI:9">XI, 9</span></span>9.
Perturbations are observed in the motions of Uranus. Adams and Leverrier
need another star at a certain place to keep the solar system in order,
and Neptune appears in the place and at the hour appointed.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_XI:10">XI, 10</span></span>10. The
instinctive wants of the animal and the intellectual wants of Cuvier;
the wants of nature and of the minds of Leverrier and Adams were alike,
and thus the results; here the

<span id="page_141">p. 141</span>

thoughts of an existence, there an existence. A well-defined lawful
want, therefore, furnishes the reason for the more complex operations of
nature.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_XI:11">XI, 11</span></span>11.
Having recorded correctly the answers furnished by nature and stretched
our senses with the growing science over her surface; having joined
hands with the levers that move the earth; we become conscious of such a
close, varied and deep contact with the world without, that our wants
and purposes become no less identified with the harmonious operations of
this vast organization, than the life, liberty and happiness of the
citizen are identified with the existence of his government.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_XI:12">XI, 12</span></span>12. As
the interests of the individual are protected by the arms of the
country, added to his own; and his needs produce certain supply in the
degree that they are felt more universally and steadily; in the same
manner does conscious citizenship in the Kingdom of nature secure us
from the annoyances of subordinate agents by our alliance with superior
powers; and by our conformity with the fundamental laws of resistance or
inducement offered to mechanical or chemical agents, we distribute the
labour to be performed between them and man to the best advantage of
inventor and user.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_XI:13">XI, 13</span></span>13. If
Plato could have witnessed the pictures executed by the sun with the
assistance of the photographer, or a hundred similar illustrations

<span id="page_142">p. 142</span>

of what man does by induction, he would perhaps have been reminded of
the intellectual midwifery of his master and, in his own mind might have
arisen the vision of a land where all manual, mechanical labour and
repetition is assigned to the power of nature, where our wants are
satisfied by purely mental operations set in motion by the will, and
where the supply is created by the demand.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_XI:14">XI, 14</span></span>14.
However distant that land may appear, induction has taught men to make
strides towards it and has surrounded him with benefits which are, at
the same time, rewards for past fidelity and incentives for more
assiduous devotion.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_XI:15">XI, 15</span></span>15.
Induction is also an aid in concentrating and strengthening our
faculties for the remainder of the journey, giving unerring solution for
individual as well as universal problems, by the mere operations of mind
in the purest form.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_XI:16">XI, 16</span></span>16. Here
we find a method, the spirit of which is, to believe that what is sought
has been accomplished, in order to accomplish it: a method, bequeathed
upon us by the same Plato who, outside of this sphere, could never find
how the ideas became realities.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_XI:17">XI, 17</span></span>17. This
conception is also elaborated by Swedenborg in his doctrine of
correspondences. And a still greater teacher has said, "What things
soever ye desire, when ye pray, believe that ye

<span id="page_143">p. 143</span>

receive them, and ye shall have them." (Mark xi. 24 R.V.) The
differences of the tenses in this passage is remarkable.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_XI:18">XI, 18</span></span>18. We
are first to believe that our desire has already been fulfilled, its
accomplishment will then follow. This is a concise direction for making
use of the creative power of thought by impressing on the Universal
subjective mind the particular thing which we desire as an already
existing fact.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_XI:19">XI, 19</span></span>19. We
are thus thinking on the plane of the absolute and eliminating all
consideration of conditions or limitation and are planting a seed which,
if left undisturbed, will finally germinate into external fruition.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_XI:20">XI, 20</span></span>20. To
review: Inductive reasoning is the process of the objective mind, by
which we compare a number of separate instances with one another until
we see the common factor that gives rise to them all. We see people in
every civilized country on the globe, securing results by some process
which they do not seem to understand themselves, and to which they
usually attach more or less mystery. Our reason is given to us for the
purpose of ascertaining the law by which these results are accomplished.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_XI:21">XI, 21</span></span>21. The
operation of this thought process is seen in those fortunate natures
that possess everything that others must acquire by toil,

<span id="page_144">p. 144</span>

who never have a struggle with conscience because they always act
correctly, and can never comport themselves otherwise than with tact,
learn everything easily, complete everything they begin with a happy
knack, live in eternal harmony with themselves, without ever reflecting
much what they do, or ever experiencing difficulty or toil.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_XI:22">XI, 22</span></span>22. The
fruit of this thought is, as it were, a gift of the gods, but a gift
which few as yet realize, appreciate, or understand. The recognition of
the marvellous power which is possessed by the mind under proper
conditions and the fact that this power can be utilized, directed, and
made available for the solution of every human problem is of
transcendental importance.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_XI:23">XI, 23</span></span>23. All
truth is the same, whether stated in modern scientific terms or in the
language of apostolic times. There are timid souls who fail to realize
that the very completeness of truth requires various statement—that no
one human formula will show every side of it.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_XI:24">XI, 24</span></span>24.
Change, emphasis, new language, novel interpretations, unfamiliar
perspectives, are not, as some suppose, signs of departure from truth,
but on the contrary they are evidence that the truth is being
apprehended in new relations to human needs, and is becoming more
generally understood.

<span id="page_145">p. 145</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_XI:25">XI, 25</span></span>25. The
truth must be told to each generation and to every people in new and
different terms, so that when the Great Teacher said—"Believe that ye
receive and ye shall receive," or when Paul said—"Faith is the substance
of things not seen," or when modern science says—"The law of attraction
is that law by which thought correlates with its object," each
statement, when subjected to analysis, is found to contain exactly the
same truth. The only difference being in the form of presentation.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_XI:26">XI, 26</span></span>26. We
are standing on the threshold of a new era. The time has arrived when
man has learned the secrets of mastery and the way is being prepared for
a new social order, more wonderful than anything ever heretofore dreamed
of. The conflict of modern science with theology, the study of
comparative religions, the tremendous power of new social movements, all
of these are but clearing the way for the new order. They may have
destroyed traditional forms which have become antiquated and impotent,
but nothing of value has been lost.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_XI:27">XI, 27</span></span>27. A new
faith has been born, a faith which demands a new form of expression, and
this faith is taking form in a deep consciousness of power which is
being manifested in the present spiritual activity found on every hand.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_XI:28">XI, 28</span></span>28. The
spirit which sleeps in the mineral, breathes in the vegetable, moves in
the animal,

<span id="page_146">p. 146</span>

and reaches its highest development in man is the Universal Mind, and it
behoves us to span the gulf between being and doing, theory and practice
by demonstrating our understanding of the dominion which we have been
given.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_XI:29">XI, 29</span></span>29. By
far the greatest discovery of all the centuries is the power of thought.
The importance of this discovery has been a little slow in reaching the
general consciousness, but it has arrived, and already in every field of
research the importance of this greatest of all great discoveries is
being demonstrated.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_XI:30">XI, 30</span></span>30. You
ask in what does the creative power of thought consist? It consists in
creating ideas, and these in turn objectify themselves by appropriating,
inventing, observing, discerning, discovering, analysing, ruling,
governing, combining and applying matter and force. It can do this
because it is an intelligent creative power.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_XI:31">XI, 31</span></span>31.
Thought reaches its loftiest activity when plunged into its own
mysterious depth; when it breaks through the narrow compass of self and
passes from truth to truth to the region of eternal light, where all
which is, was or ever will be, melt into one grand harmony.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_XI:32">XI, 32</span></span>32. From
this process of self contemplation comes inspiration which is creative
intelligence, and which is undeniably superior to every element, force
or law of nature, because it can understand, modify, govern and apply
them to

<span id="page_147">p. 147</span>

its own ends and purposes and therefore possess them.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_XI:33">XI, 33</span></span>33.
Wisdom begins with the dawn of reason, and reason is but an
understanding of the knowledge and principles whereby we may know the
true meaning of things. Wisdom, then, is illuminated reason, and this
wisdom leads to humility, for humility is a large part of Wisdom.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_XI:34">XI, 34</span></span>34. We
all know many who have achieved the seemingly impossible, who have
realized life-long dreams, who have changed everything, including
themselves. We have sometimes marvelled at the demonstration of an
apparently irresistible power, which seemed to be ever available just
when it was most needed. But it is all clear now. All that is required
is an understanding of certain definite fundamental principles and their
proper application.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_XI:35">XI, 35</span></span>35. For
your next exercise, concentrate on the quotation taken from the Bible,
"Whatsoever things ye desire, when ye pray, believe that ye receive them
and ye shall have them." Notice that there is no limitation, "Whatsoever
things" is very definite and implies that the only limitation which is
placed upon us is in our ability to think, to be equal to the occasion,
to rise to the emergency, to remember that Faith is not a shadow, but a
substance, "the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things
not seen.
