### PART TWENTY-ONE

<div style="font-size: 90%">

THIS Part explains how we may come into possession of power sufficient
to meet every situation which may arise in life. It explains that the
ability to eliminate imperfect conditions depends upon mental action. It
explains that great ideas have a tendency to eliminate smaller ideas, so
that it is well to hold ideas which are large enough to counteract and
destroy all small or undesirable tendencies. This is one of the secrets
of success, one of the accomplishments of the Master Mind. It explains
that the creative energy finds no more difficulty in handling a large
situation than a small one. It explains how conditions are produced in
our lives by the predominant thoughts which we entertain. It explains
how you may set causes in motion which will create an irresistible
magnetic power which will bring the things you require to you. It
explains the issue between the old regime and the new, it explains the
crux of the social problem, it explains the true secret of health,
wealth and power.

#### INTRODUCTION. PART TWENTY-ONE

In paragraph seven of this Part you will find that one of the secrets of
success, one of the methods of organizing victory, one of the
accomplishments of the Master Mind is to think big thoughts.

In paragraph eight you will find that everything which we hold in our
consciousness for any length of time becomes impressed upon our
subconsciousness and so becomes a pattern which the creative energy will
weave into our life and environment. This is the secret of the wonderful
power of prayer.

We know that the universe is governed by law; that for every effect
there must be a cause, and that the same cause, under the same
conditions, will invariably produce the same effect. Consequently, if
prayer has ever been answered, it will always be answered, if the proper
conditions are complied with. This must necessarily be true; otherwise
the Universe would be a chaos instead of a cosmos. The answer to prayer
is therefore subject to law, and this law is definite, exact and
scientific, just as are the laws governing gravitation and electricity.
An understanding of this law takes the foundation of Christianity out of
the realm of superstition and credulity and places it upon the firm rock
of scientific understanding.

But, unfortunately, there are comparatively few persons who know how to
pray. They understand that there are laws governing electricity,
mathematics and chemistry, but, for some inexplicable reason, it never
seems to occur to them that there are also spiritual laws, and that
these laws are also definite, scientific, exact, and operate with
immutable precision.

#### PART TWENTY-ONE

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_XXI:1">XXI, 1</span></span>1. The
real secret of power is consciousness of power. The Universal Mind is
unconditional; therefore, the more conscious we become of our unity with
this mind, the less conscious we shall become of conditions and
limitations, and as we become emancipated or freed from conditions we
come into a realization of the unconditional. We have become free!

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_XXI:2">XXI, 2</span></span>2. As
soon as we become conscious of the inexhaustible power in the world
within, we begin to draw on this power and apply and develop the greater
possibilities which this discernment has realized, because whatever we
become conscious of, is invariably manifested in the objective world, is
brought forth into tangible expression.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_XXI:3">XXI, 3</span></span>3. This
is because the Infinite mind, which is the source from which all things
proceed, is one and indivisible, and each individual is a channel
whereby this Eternal Energy is being manifested. Our ability to think is
our ability to act upon this Universal substance, and what we think is
what is created or produced in the objective world.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_XXI:4">XXI, 4</span></span>4. The
result of this discovery is nothing less than marvellous, and means that
mind is extraordinary in quality, limitless in quantity and contains
possibilities without number. To become conscious of this power is to
become a "live wire"; it has the same effect as placing an ordinary wire
in contact with a wire that is

<span id="page_270">p. 270</span>

charged. The Universal is the live wire. It carries power sufficient to
meet every situation which may arise in the life of every individual.
When the individual mind touches the Universal Mind it receives all the
power it requires. This is the world within. All science recognizes the
reality of this world, and all power is contingent upon our recognition
of this world.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_XXI:5">XXI, 5</span></span>5. The
ability to eliminate imperfect conditions depends upon mental action,
and mental action depends upon consciousness of power; therefore, the
more conscious we become of our unity with the source of all power, the
greater will be our power to control and master every condition.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_XXI:6">XXI, 6</span></span>6. Large
ideas have a tendency to eliminate all smaller ideas so that it is well
to hold ideas large enough to counteract and destroy all small or
undesirable tendencies. This will remove innumerable petty and annoying
obstacles from your path. You also become conscious of a larger world of
thought, thereby increasing your mental capacity as well as placing
yourself in position to accomplish something of value.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_XXI:7">XXI, 7</span></span>7. This
is one of the secrets of success, one of the methods of organizing
victory, one of the accomplishments of the Master-mind. He thinks big
thoughts. The creative energies of mind find no more difficulty in
handling large situations than small ones. Mind is just as

<span id="page_271">p. 271</span>

much present in the Infinitely large as in the Infinitely small.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_XXI:8">XXI, 8</span></span>8. When
we realize these facts concerning mind we understand how we may bring to
ourselves any condition by creating the corresponding conditions in our
consciousness, because everything which is held for any length of time
in the consciousness, eventually becomes impressed upon the
sub-conscious and thus becomes a pattern which the creative energy will
weave into the life and environment of the individual.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_XXI:9">XXI, 9</span></span>9. In
this way conditions are produced and we find that our lives are simply
the reflection of our predominant thoughts, our mental attitude; we see
then that the science of correct thinking is the one science, that it
includes all other sciences.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_XXI:10">XXI, 10</span></span>10.
From this science we learn that every thought creates an impression in
the brain, that these impressions create mental tendencies, and these
tendencies create character, ability and purpose, and that the combined
action of character, ability and purpose determines the experiences with
which we shall meet in life.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_XXI:11">XXI, 11</span></span>11.
These experiences come to us through the law of attraction; through the
action of this law we meet in the world without the experiences which
correspond to our world within.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_XXI:12">XXI, 12</span></span>12. The
predominant thought or the mental attitude is the magnet, and the law is
that like

<span id="page_272">p. 272</span>

attracts like, consequently the mental attitude will invariably attract
such conditions as correspond to its nature.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_XXI:13">XXI, 13</span></span>13.
This mental attitude is our personality and is composed of the thoughts
which we have been creating in our own mind; therefore, if we wish a
change in conditions all that is necessary is to change our thought;
this will in turn change our mental attitude, which will in turn change
our personality, which will in turn change the persons, things and
conditions, or the experiences with which we meet in life.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_XXI:14">XXI, 14</span></span>14. It
is, however, no easy matter to change the mental attitude, but by
persistent effort it may be accomplished; the mental attitude is
patterned after the mental pictures which have been photographed on the
brain; if you do not like the pictures, destroy the negatives and create
new pictures; this is the art of visualization.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_XXI:15">XXI, 15</span></span>15. As
soon as you have done this you will begin to attract new things, and the
new things will correspond to the new pictures. To do this: impress on
the mind a perfect picture of the desire which you wish to have
objectified and continue to hold the picture in mind until results are
obtained.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_XXI:16">XXI, 16</span></span>16. If
the desire is one which requires determination, ability, talent,
courage, power or any other spiritual power, these are necessary
essentials for your picture; build them in; they are

<span id="page_273">p. 273</span>

the vital part of the picture; they are the feeling which combines with
thought and creates the irresistible magnetic power which draws the
things you require to you. They give your picture life, and life means
growth, and as soon as it begins to grow, the result is practically
assured.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_XXI:17">XXI, 17</span></span>17. Do
not hesitate to aspire to the highest possible attainments in anything
you may undertake, for the mind forces are ever ready to lend themselves
to a purposeful will in the effort to crystallize its highest
aspirations into acts, accomplishments and events.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_XXI:18">XXI, 18</span></span>18. An
illustration of how these mind forces operate is suggested by the method
in which all our habits are formed. We do a thing, then do it again, and
again, and again, until it becomes easy and perhaps almost automatic;
and the same rule applies in breaking any and all bad habits; we stop
doing a thing, and then avoid it again, and again until we are entirely
free from it; and if we do fail now and then, we should by no means lose
hope, for the law is absolute and invincible and gives us credit for
every effort and every success, even though our efforts and successes
are perhaps intermittent.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_XXI:19">XXI, 19</span></span>19.
There is no limit to what this law can do for you; dare to believe in
your own ideal; remember that Nature is plastic to the ideal; think of
the ideal as an already accomplished fact.

<span id="page_274">p. 274</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_XXI:20">XXI, 20</span></span>20. The
real battle of life is one of ideas; it is being fought out by the few
against the many; on the one side is the constructive and creative
thought, on the other side the destructive and negative thought; the
creative thought is dominated by an ideal, the passive thought is
dominated by appearances. On both sides are men of science, men of
letters and men of affairs.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_XXI:21">XXI, 21</span></span>21. On
the creative side are men who spend their time in laboratories, or over
microscopes and telescopes, side by side with the men who dominate the
commercial, political and scientific world; on the negative side are men
who spend their time investigating law and precedent, men who mistake
theology for religion, statesmen who mistake might for right, and all
the millions who seem to prefer precedent to progress, who are eternally
looking backward instead of forward, who see only the world without, but
know nothing of the world within.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_XXI:22">XXI, 22</span></span>22. In
the last analysis there are but these two classes; all men will have to
take their place on one side or the other; they will have to go forward,
or go back; there is no standing still in a world where all is motion;
it is this attempt to stand still that gives sanction and force to
arbitrary and unequal codes of law.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_XXI:23">XXI, 23</span></span>23.
That we are in a period of transition is evidenced by the unrest which
is everywhere apparent. The complaint of humanity is as a

<span id="page_275">p. 275</span>

roll of heaven's artillery, commencing with low and threatening notes
and increasing until the sound is sent from cloud to cloud, and the
lightning rends the air and earth.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_XXI:24">XXI, 24</span></span>24. The
sentries who patrol the most advanced outposts of the Industrial,
Political and Religious world are calling anxiously to each other. What
of the night? The danger and insecurity of the position they occupy and
attempt to hold is becoming more apparent every hour. The dawn of a new
era necessarily declares that the existing order of things cannot much
longer be.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_XXI:25">XXI, 25</span></span>25. The
issue between the old regime and the new, the crux of the social
problem, is entirely a question of conviction in the minds of the people
as to the nature of the Universe. When they realize that the
transcendent force of spirit or mind of the Cosmos is within each
individual, it will be possible to frame laws that shall consider the
liberties and rights of the many instead of the privileges of the few.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_XXI:26">XXI, 26</span></span>26. As
long as the people regard the Cosmic power as a power non-human and
alien to humanity, so long will it be comparatively easy for a supposed
privileged class to rule by Divine right in spite of every protest of
social sentiment. The real interest of humanity is therefore to exalt,
emancipate and recognize the divinity of the human spirit. To recognize
that all power is from within. That no human being has any more power
than any other human being, except

<span id="page_276">p. 276</span>

such as may willingly be delegated to him. The old regime would have us
believe that the law was superior to the law-makers; herein is the gist
of the social crime of every form of privilege and personal inequality,
the institutionalizing of the fatalistic doctrine of Divine election.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_XXI:27">XXI, 27</span></span>27. The
Divine Mind is the Universal Mind; it does not act through sheer caprice
or from anger, jealousy or wrath; neither can it be flattered, cajoled
or moved by sympathy or petition to supply man with some need which he
thinks necessary for his happiness or even his existence. The Divine
Mind makes no exceptions in favour of any individual; but when the
individual understands and realizes his Unity with the Universal
Principle he will appear to be favoured because he will have found the
source of all health, all wealth and all power.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_XXI:28">XXI, 28</span></span>28. For
your next exercise, concentrate on the Truth. Try to realize that the
Truth shall make you free, that is, nothing can permanently stand in the
way of your perfect success when you learn to apply the scientifically
correct thought methods and principles. Realize that you are
eternalizing in your environment, your inherent soul potencies. Realize
that the Silence offers an ever available and almost unlimited
opportunity for awakening the highest conception of Truth. Try to
comprehend that

<span id="page_277">p. 277</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Omnipotence itself
is absolute silence; all else is change, activity, limitation. Silent
thought concentration is therefore the true method of reaching,
awakening and then expressing the wonderful potential power of the world
within.

#### PART TWENTY-ONE

201\. *What is the real secret of power?*

The consciousness of power, because whatever we become conscious of, is
invariably manifested in the objective world, is brought forth into
tangible expression.

202\. *What is the source of this power?*

The Universal Mind, from which all things proceed, and which is one and
indivisible.

203\. *How is this power being manifested?*

Through the individual. Each individual is a channel whereby this energy
is being differentiated in form.

204\. *How may we connect with this Omnipotence?*

Our ability to think is our ability to act on this Universal Energy, and
what we think is what is produced or created in the objective world.

205\. *What is the result of this discovery?*

The result is nothing less than marvellous; it opens unprecedented and
limitless opportunity.

206\. *How, then, may we eliminate imperfect conditions?*

By becoming conscious of our Unity with the source of all power.

<span id="page_279">p. 279</span>

207\. *What is one of the distinctive characteristics of the Master
Mind?*

He thinks big thoughts, he holds ideas large enough to counteract and
destroy all petty and annoying obstacles.

208\. *How do experiences come to us?*

Through the law of attraction.

209\. *How is this law brought into operation?*

By our predominant mental attitude.

210\. *What is the issue between the old regime and the new?*

A question of conviction as to the nature of the Universe. The old
regime is trying to cling to the fatalistic doctrine of Divine election.
The new regime recognizes [the](errata.htm#3.md) divinity of the
individual, the divinity of humanity.
