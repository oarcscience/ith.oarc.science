#### PART TWENTY

<div style="font-size: 90%">

THIS Part tells what the true business of life is and the result. It
shows that we can obtain no results as long as we remain oblivious to
the only power there is, an understanding of the principles, forces,
methods and combinations of mind and its relation to the Universal mind.
It explains that the Universal can act only through the Individual; it
shows that we are the channel for its activity, that it is within us,
that we are it. We can, of course, fail to recognize it and so exclude
it from our consciousness, but it will nevertheless be the basic fact of
all existence. It tells of inspiration, the art of adjusting the
individual mind to that of the Universal, the art of becoming a channel
for the flow of Infinite Wisdom.

#### INTRODUCTION. PART TWENTY

For many years there has been an endless discussion as to the origin of
evil. Theologians have told us that God is Love, and that God is
Omnipresent. If this be true, there is no place where God is not. Where,
then, are Evil, Satan and Hell? Let us see:

<div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%;">

God is Spirit.

Spirit is the Creative Principle of the Universe.

Man is made in the image and likeness of God.

Man is therefore a spiritual being.

The only activity which spirit possesses is the power to think.

Thinking is therefore a creative process.

All form is therefore the result of the thinking process.

The destruction of form must also be a result of the thinking process.

Fictitious representations of form are the result of the creative power
of thought, as in Hypnotism.

Apparent representations of form are the result of the creative power of
thought, as in Spiritualism.

Invention, organization and constructive work of all kinds are the
result of the creative power of thought, as in concentration.

When the creative power of thought is manifested for the benefit of
humanity, we call the result good.

When the creative power of thought is manifested in a destructive or
evil manner, we call the result evil.

This indicates the origin of both good and evil; they are simply words
which have been coined in order to indicate the nature of the result of
the thinking or creative process.

Thought necessarily precedes and predetermines action; action precedes
and predetermines condition.

Part Twenty will throw more light upon this important subject.

#### PART TWENTY

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_XX:1">XX, 1</span></span>1. The
spirit of a thing is that thing; it is necessarily fixed, changeless and
eternal. The spirit of you is—you; without the spirit you would be
nothing. It becomes active through your recognition of it and its
possibilities.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_XX:2">XX, 2</span></span>2. You may
have all the wealth in Christendom, but unless you recognize it and make
use of it, it will have no value; so with your spiritual wealth: unless
you recognize it and use it, it will have no value. The one and only
condition of spiritual power is use or recognition.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_XX:3">XX, 3</span></span>3. All
great things come through recognition; the sceptre of power is
consciousness, and thought is its messenger, and this messenger is
constantly moulding the realities of the invisible world into the
conditions and environments of your objective world.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_XX:4">XX, 4</span></span>4. Thinking
is the true business of life, power is the result. You are at all times
dealing with the magical power of thought and consciousness. What
results can you expect so long as you remain oblivious to the power
which has been placed within your control?

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_XX:5">XX, 5</span></span>5. So long
as you do this you limit yourself to superficial conditions, and make of
yourself a beast of burden for those who think; those who recognize
their power; those who know that unless we are willing to think we shall
have to work, and the less we think the more we shall have to work, and
the less we shall get for our work.

<span id="page_256">p. 256</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_XX:6">XX, 6</span></span>6. The
secret of power is a perfect understanding of the principles, forces,
methods and combinations of Mind, and a perfect understanding of our
relationship to the Universal Mind. It is well to remember that this
principle is unchangeable; if this were not so, it would not be
reliable; all principles are changeless.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_XX:7">XX, 7</span></span>7. This
stability is your opportunity; you are its active attribute, the channel
for its activity; the Universal can act only through the individual.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_XX:8">XX, 8</span></span>8. When you
begin to perceive that the essence of the Universal is within
yourself—is you—you begin to do things; you begin to feel your power; it
is the fuel which fires the imagination; which lights the torch of
inspiration; which gives vitality to thought; which enables you to
connect with all the invisible forces of the Universe. It is this power
which will enable you to plan fearlessly, to execute masterfully.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_XX:9">XX, 9</span></span>9. But
perception will come only in the Silence; this seems to be the condition
required for all great purposes. You are a visualizing entity.
Imagination is your workshop. It is here that your ideal is to be
visualized.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_XX:10">XX, 10</span></span>10. As a
perfect understanding of the nature of this power is a primary condition
for its manifestation, visualize the entire method over

<span id="page_257">p. 257</span>

and over again, so that you may use it whenever occasion requires.
Supreme wisdom is to follow the method whereby we may have the
inspiration of the omnipotent Universal Mind on demand at any time.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_XX:11">XX, 11</span></span>11. We
can fail to recognize this world within, and so exclude it from our
consciousness, but it will still be the basic fact of all existence; and
when we learn to recognize it, not only in ourselves, but in all
persons, events, things and circumstances, we shall have found the
"Kingdom of Heaven" which we are told is "within" us.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_XX:12">XX, 12</span></span>12. Our
failures are a result of the operation of exactly the same principle;
the principle is unchangeable; its operation is exact, there is no
deviation; if we think lack, limitation, discord, we shall find their
fruits on every hand; if we think poverty, unhappiness or disease, the
thought messengers will carry the summons as readily as any other kind
of thought and the result will be just as certain. If we fear a coming
calamity, we shall be able to say with Job, "the thing I feared has come
upon me"; if we think unkindly or ignorantly we shall thus attract to
ourselves the results of our ignorance.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_XX:13">XX, 13</span></span>13. This
power of thought, if understood and correctly used, is the greatest
labour-saving device ever dreamed of, but if not understood or
improperly used, the result will in all probability be disastrous, as we
have already seen;

<span id="page_258">p. 258</span>

by the help of this power you can confidently undertake things that are
seemingly impossible, because this power is the secret of all
inspiration, all genius.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_XX:14">XX, 14</span></span>14. To
become inspired means to get out of the beaten path, out of the rut,
because extraordinary results require extraordinary means. When we come
into a recognition of the Unity of all things and that the source of all
power is within, we tap the source of inspiration.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_XX:15">XX, 15</span></span>15.
Inspiration is the art of imbibing, the art of self-realization; the art
of adjusting the individual mind to that of the Universal Mind; the art
of attaching the proper mechanism to the source of all power; the art of
differentiating the formless into form; the art of becoming a channel
for the flow of Infinite Wisdom; the art of visualizing perfection; the
art of realizing the omnipresence of Omnipotence.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_XX:16">XX, 16</span></span>16. An
understanding and appreciation of the fact that the infinite power is
omnipresent and is therefore in the infinitely small as well as the
infinitely large will enable us to absorb its essence; a further
understanding of the fact that this power is spirit and therefore
indivisible will enable us to appreciate its presence at all points at
the same time.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_XX:17">XX, 17</span></span>17. An
understanding of these facts, first intellectually and then emotionally,
will enable us to drink deeply from this ocean of infinite

<span id="page_259">p. 259</span>

power. An intellectual understanding will be of no assistance; the
emotions must be brought into action; thought without feeling is cold.
The required combination is thought and feeling.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_XX:18">XX, 18</span></span>18.
Inspiration is from within. The Silence is necessary, the senses must be
stilled, the muscles relaxed, repose cultivated. When you have thus come
into possession of a sense of poise and power you will be ready to
receive the information or inspiration or wisdom which may be necessary
for the development of your purpose.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_XX:19">XX, 19</span></span>19. Do
not confuse these methods with those of the clairvoyant; they have
nothing in common. Inspiration is the art of receiving and makes for all
that is best in life; your business in life is to understand and command
these invisible forces instead of letting them command and rule you.
Power implies service; inspiration implies power; to understand and
apply the method of inspiration is to become a superman.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_XX:20">XX, 20</span></span>20. We
can live more abundantly every time we breathe, if we consciously
breathe with that intention. The IF is a very important condition in
this case, as the intention governs the attention, and without the
attention you can secure only the results which every one else secures.
That is, a supply equal to the demand.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_XX:21">XX, 21</span></span>21. In
order to secure the larger supply

<span id="page_260">p. 260</span>

your demand must be increased, and as you consciously increase the
demand the supply will follow, you will find yourself coming into a
larger and larger supply of life, energy and vitality.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_XX:22">XX, 22</span></span>22. The
reason for this is not difficult to understand, but it is another of the
vital mysteries of life which does not seem to be generally appreciated.
If you make it your own you will find it one of the great realities of
life.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_XX:23">XX, 23</span></span>23. We
are told that "In Him we live and move and have our being," and we are
told that "He" is a Spirit, and again that "He" is Love, so that every
time we breathe, we breathe this life, love and spirit. This is Pranic
Energy, or Pranic Ether; we could not exist a moment without it. It is
the Cosmic Energy; it is the Life of the Solar Plexus.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_XX:24">XX, 24</span></span>24. Every
time we breathe we fill our lungs with air and at the same time vitalize
our body with this Pranic Ether which is Life itself, so that we have
the opportunity of making a conscious connection with All Life, All
Intelligence and All Substance.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_XX:25">XX, 25</span></span>25. A
knowledge of your relation and oneness with this Principle that governs
the Universe and the simple method whereby you can consciously identify
yourself with it gives you a scientific understanding of a law whereby
you may free yourself from disease, from lack or

<span id="page_261">p. 261</span>

limitation of any kind; in fact, it enables you to breathe the "breath
of life" into your own nostrils.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_XX:26">XX, 26</span></span>26. This
"breath of life" is a super-conscious reality. It is the essence of the
"I am." It is pure "Being" or Universal Substance and our conscious
unity with it enables us to localize it, and thus exercise the powers of
this creative energy.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_XX:27">XX, 27</span></span>27.
Thought is creative vibration and the quality of the conditions created
will depend upon the quality of our thought, because we cannot express
powers which we do not possess. We must "be" before we can "do" and we
can "do" only to the extent to which we "are," and so what we do will
necessarily coincide with what we "are" and what we are depends upon
what we "think."

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_XX:28">XX, 28</span></span>28. Every
time you think you start a train of causation which will create a
condition in strict accordance with the quality of the thought which
originated it. Thought which is in

harmony with the Universal Mind will result in corresponding conditions.
Thought which is destructive or discordant will produce corresponding
results. You may use thought constructively or destructively, but the
immutable law will not allow you to plant a thought of one kind and reap
the fruit of another. You are free to use this marvellous creative power
as you will, but you must take the consequences.

<span id="page_262">p. 262</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_XX:29">XX, 29</span></span>29. This
is the danger from what is called Will Power. There are those who seem
to think that by force of will they can coerce this law that they can
sow seed of one kind and by "Will Power" make it bear fruit of another,
but the fundamental principle of creative power is the Universal, and
therefore the idea of forcing a compliance with our wishes by the power
of the individual will is an inverted conception, which may appear to
succeed for a while but is eventually doomed to failure, because it
antagonizes the very power which it is seeking to use.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_XX:30">XX, 30</span></span>30. It is
the individual attempting to coerce the Universal, the finite in
conflict with the Infinite. Our permanent well-being will be best
conserved by a conscious co-operation with the continuous forward
movement of the Great Whole.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_XX:31">XX, 31</span></span>31. For
your next exercise, go into the Silence and concentrate on the fact that
"In Him we live and move and have our being" is literally and
scientifically exact! That you ARE because He IS, that if He is
Omnipresent He must be in you. That if He is all in all you must be in
Him! That He is Spirit and you are made in "His image and likeness" and
that the only difference between His spirit and your spirit is one of
degree, that a part must be the same in kind and quality as the whole.
When you can realize this clearly you will have found

<span id="page_263">p. 263</span>

the secret of the creative power of thought, you will have found the
origin of both good and evil, you will have found the secret of the
wonderful power of concentration, you will have found the key to the
solution of every problem whether physical, financial or environmental.
