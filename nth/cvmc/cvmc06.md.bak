### THE EMOTIONS

IT must be clear from what has already been said that in order to
conserve health it is necessary to maintain unimpaired the mental
energy, or, as it is sometimes called, the vitality. It will be well,
therefore, before proceeding further, to inquire as to what agencies
tend to impair it.

The answer is, broadly speaking, anything which fatigues or depresses or
profoundly shocks the mind.

You know how fatigue "takes the life out" of one. The reason is not far
to seek. Whatever we do, we do first mentally; unless one "puts his mind
on his work" he can not do that work successfully. And this mental
effort stimulates the brain, keeps

<span id="page_41">p. 41</span>

it pumping energy to the [muscles](errata.htm#0.md), until finally the
muscles refuse to act, because both mind and brain are fatigued. And
this fatigue, it is said, generates a poison which affects the blood.

To continue to whip up the muscles by pure force of will when this point
is reached is sheer folly. Yet we see it done every day, and regardless
of the knowledge that under such conditions the system is an easy prey
to disease.

Lack of sleep also greatly depletes the vital force, but this is so well
known as hardly to need mention. Anxiety or worry has the same effect.
Some authorities say it breaks down the brain-cells, and in many cases
through its effect on the solar plexus it acts either as an emetic or a
cathartic.

Equally devitalizing are certain emotions. Take anger, for instance. At
first, there is a marked increase of energy, owing to the fact that the
emotion appears to charge the brain electrically--the reserves are
called

<span id="page_42">p. 42</span>

out! This sets free a tremendous current of vital force, which swoops
down upon the sympathetic nerve-center, affects the heart, and deranges
the circulation, and through its action on the solar plexus interferes
with digestion. As the emotion subsides, this force, otherwise
unexpended, radiates into space and then ensues exhaustion. It is a sort
of cyclone, which not only deranges the physical processes and takes the
strength but acidulates the blood.

Then there is fear, which, as everybody knows, sometimes causes death.
Sudden and violent fear powerfully affects the heart, causing exhaustion
and occasionally instant death. Its effect upon the blood is also
apparent, for it has been known to turn the hair white in a single
night.

Prolonged grief and despondency by depressing the mind weaken the brain
and retard the circulation; thus by degrees the vitality is sapped.
"Dying of a broken heart" is no chimera of the imagination.

<span id="page_43">p. 43</span>

"Each strong emotion," says Herbert Spencer, "affects the activity of
the heart, and with it we have the accompanying gush of nervous fluid,
spreading along the vasomotor nerves, which changes the state of the
arteries throughout the body. . . . It also disturbs the intellectual
balance--nervous fluid is drafted off."

It does not seem to be generally understood that strong emotions
unbalance the mind, and of course the brain; but a little reflection
shows that this is true. An angry person will not "listen to reason,"
because his reason is overwhelmed by emotion. In other words, he is
"beside himself "--hence we speak of "insane rage."

The same is true of fear. Let a man's life be jeopardized, and he may at
once lose all consciousness of moral obligations. The panics which occur
on steamboats and in fires are illustrations.

Extreme jealousy is a kind of madness.

Shakespeare in "The Winter's Tale"

<span id="page_44">p. 44</span>

shows how impossible it is to convince a jealous person that his
suspicions are unfounded. The poor victim has lost his mental
perspective--he "can't see straight."

.     .     .     .     .     .     .

In view of these facts, it is obvious that in order to preserve the
vitality--that is, hold stored up in the brain a reserve of mental
energy--one must acquire and practise self-control. It is not always
possible to avoid sudden grief or fear, but the habit of self-control,
once established, gives one the power to minimize all catastrophes. It
is always possible by the practise of self-control to vanquish anger,
jealousy, and despondency. Many persons are emotional spendthrifts; they
fritter away their life-energy by giving full rein to their emotional
nature, and as a consequence have nothing left with which to meet the
emergencies of life. Their account in the bank of nature is overdrawn.

<span id="page_45">p. 45</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Is it any wonder
that they succumb readily to disease?

But self-control does not necessarily imply the *stifling* of all
emotion; let us be human beings, not *clams*. An existence which knows
not all the deepest emotions that the human soul is capable of feeling
and expressing is only a poor travesty of life. The point is to control,
rather than be controlled by, one's emotions.

However, to our satisfaction and for our salvation there is a class of
emotions which is in sharp contrast to those discust, because distinctly
vitalizing. There is cheerfulness, for instance, and contentment. All
our psychologists, physiologists, and physicians are agreed that
cheerfulness, contentment, hope, joy, and happiness are the best tonics
in the world, the true balm of Gilead or elixir of life. It is not
surprizing, therefore, that the society of the cheerful person is
eagerly sought.
