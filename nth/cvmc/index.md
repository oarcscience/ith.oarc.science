*And with all the \[world crises\] going on today, it's no wonder that a
lot of people are beginning to feel like a Christian Scientist with
appendicitis*--Tom Leher, *That Was The Year That Was*

A lot of the theories floated by progressive thinkers at the turn of the
20th century have today been consigned to the dust bin of history. Some
have, however, entered the mainstream. For instance, the 'Mind Cure,'
essentially New Thought/Christian Science without the mystical and
religious entanglements, is not so far off from what is now termed
mind-body medicine. This long-out-of-print book is a succinct and very
clearly written exposition of the Mind Cure. The Mind Cure acknowledges
the active role that the patient's mental state can take in resolving
health problems, while not disregarding orthodox western medicine. Much
of the advice in this book would today probably be regarded by many
medical professionals as sensible, and at the very least, not harmful.
Nonetheless, please observe the caveat in the site [terms of
service](../../tos) about 'medical advice,' and consult with a doctor
before using any of the treatments in this text.

Another progressive reform used in this book, 'simplified spelling'
(e.g. *tho,* *fixt,* *possest*) has not fared as well in the interim. As
usual, I have left original spelling intact except where it is an actual
typographical error, in which case it is corrected and linked to the
[errata page](errata).
