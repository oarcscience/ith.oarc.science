### IX

### CONCLUSION

IT is impossible to state at this moment just what the limitations of
mind-cure are. It has been little more than half a century since the
subject was lifted out of the realm of the occult and placed upon a
scientific basis, tho for most persons it still possesses a mystic
character. Much has been learned, but there is undoubtedly much more to
learn; we are still merely "nibbling around the edges."

Less than fifty years ago there were few physicians who believed that
disease could be cured by mental influence; to-day there are clinics in
many European cities, and leading physicians of America are using it in
one form or another.

At present the medical fraternity takes

<span id="page_79">p. 79</span>

the ground that only mental, nervous, and functional disorders are
amenable to mind-cure. Its future, therefore, seems to hinge upon the
distinction between functional disorders and organic affections. On this
point Dr. Schofield, of London, says in his "Force of Mind" that the
more we examine this distinction, the more it tends to disappear; while
another authority says: "There is no disease which does not involve
organic change somewhere "--which seems reasonable. For we know that no
organ can perform its functions if the nervous action is weak, and the
lessened blood-supply impairs nutrition. Would not cellular degeneration
finally ensue?

If this process could be arrested in its incipient stage, and functional
action and nutrition improved by a combined medical and mental
treatment, or by the latter alone in the manner already indicated, the
probability is that the parts could be built up.

<span id="page_80">p. 80</span>

Dr. Gayer, of New York City, at the head of a new movement looking
toward further investigation, claims that under hypnosis several cases
of organic affection have been cured recently--if we are to trust the
press--and also a severely burned arm healed.

The latter does not seem surprizing when we remember that under hypnosis
French physicians have raised blisters on various parts of the body,
have caused drops of blood to exude from the skin and even the name to
appear, written in letters. of blood upon the arm.

Dr. Carpenter, in "Mental Physiology," describes a cure of warts by
simple "suggestion," and the daily papers report that there is living
to-day in a Boston suburb a man who cures such excrescences by simply
passing his hand over them. Corns have also been cured by suggestion.

As regards structural changes, it is an open question. The distinguished
Frenchman

<span id="page_81">p. 81</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Camille Flammarion
asserts that the entire body may be caused to undergo change within a
year; the softer portions yielding in from one to three months, the
harder portions requiring eleven months.

In apparent confirmation of this we have Mailer's law: "A structural
defect tends to be removed by an act increasing the organic action of
the part."

And that this may be a mental act, Dr. Laycock points out, for he says:
"If the attention be daily directed to an opaque cornea during a
hypnotic trance, a deposit of lymph will be observed to form."

But why hypnosis, when a conscious act of attention is "sufficient to
change the physical action of the part"?

Where poison has entered the blood, the out look is not encouraging. Yet
Professor Gates has shown by his "Wonder-Bottle" that emotional states
change the character of the blood, and it is almost too well known to
mention that grief, fear, despondency,

<span id="page_82">p. 82</span>

and disappointment turn the hair white.

During the siege of Orleans, so the story runs, the soldiers of the
Prince of Orange who were afflicted with scurvy were cured by a trick
(practically suggestion)--no medicine being available.

It is not generally known that the Yogis of India possess a remarkable
control of the body. They have the power to annul pain, and practised
feats of levitation, walking on water, etc., centuries before the time
of Christ. One of their number who visited Europe and America about five
years ago demonstrated to physicians in both countries his ability to
stop his heart's action for five seconds at a time--at least so the
papers stated.

This, however, has been paralleled in the West. Dr. Brown-Séquard, of
Paris, relates that he had a student in one of his classes who could
diminish or accelerate his pulse at will. And Dr. Tuckey in
"Psycho-Therapeutics"

<span id="page_83">p. 83</span>

gives, on the authority of Dr. Cheyne, an account of the experiments of
a Colonel Townsend. This gentleman, in the presence of physicians,
diminished his heart-action until it ceased entirely, and the
physicians, after the usual tests, decided that the experiment had been
carried too far. But as they were about to leave the room, signs of
returning life appeared, and not long after, the heart was beating in a
normal manner.

And thus we begin again at the beginning; we do not yet know to what
extent the mind may control the body. Because a certain thing has never
been done is no reason for assuming that it never will be done. Back to
prehistoric cave-dwelling man, rude and unlettered, fashioning his rude
implements of clay, is a far cry; and compared with it the civilization
of which we boast seems a wondrous thing. Yet it has been compassed
solely by the developing brain and mind of man. He

<span id="page_84">p. 84</span>

has dominated the lower orders of living creatures; he has girdled the
earth; who doubts that he will navigate the air? He is harnessing the
forces of nature and bending them to his service.

It seems hardly probable that if man can thus control forces external to
himself, he is to remain forever subject to forces at work in his own
organism. We can not assume that he has reached the climax of his
powers--the goal of evolution--and if not, then he will continue to
develop mentally.

And this development must certainly give greater self-knowledge and
self-command. At the present the average man regards himself as a purely
material being--of his mental life and power he has little cognizance.
But when he awakes to this self-knowledge, there will follow inevitably
an increase of mental power. And thus one may venture to prophesy that
through an ever-growing consciousness

<span id="page_85">p. 85</span>

of power may man find his way at last to an absolute spiritual dominion,
not only over nature but over self.

Mind-cure has been traced to Epidamus, an Egyptian priest, who
flourished 500 years before the Christian era. Following him came the
Hebrew prophets, who, it is said, also raised from the dead. Then came
Jesus and His apostles, whose practises were followed by the priests of
the Greek Church until the eleventh century.

In medieval times appeared St. Patrick the Apostle, and also the monk
Gassner, who healed by touch, as did likewise some of the kings of that
age.

In the seventeenth century Valentine Greatrakes, of Ireland, created
great excitement; tho hardly greater, perhaps, than did Mesmer, in the
last quarter of the eighteenth century, in Paris.

The cures effected by the metallic tractors in England, the "Shriners"
of London, "Dr." Cullis of Boston, and the

<span id="page_86">p. 86</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Mormon Elders are
comparatively recent; while the miracle, faith, and prayer cures,
hypnosis, Christian Science, and New Thought are current history.

A study of these various forms of cure discloses two facts: First, that
practically every known disease has been cured by one or another, or so
claimed. How permanent such cures were we have no means of knowing. And,
second, that all such cures were effected by "a change in the mentality"
or a change in the "state of mind." Without this, the cure could not
have been wrought.

The only logical conclusion which can be deduced from these facts is
that disease is mental or of mental origin.

Every sensible person knows that there is no healing virtue in the bone
of some long-defunct saint (even if it can be proved that the bone was
once a part of the anatomy of the saint!), but if the sufferer
*believes* that touching it or kissing it will cure his

<span id="page_87">p. 87</span>

disease, the cure takes place. And if he *believes* that he is cured,
then the disease must have been mental. And if all diseases have been
cured by some such means--that is, a change in the mental state--then
all disease must be mental.

But, it may be objected, such a disease as consumption can not be
mental, because it is induced by bad sanitation.

Let us look at this. St. Paul said, "Man has a natural body and a
spiritual body"; but this is equivalent to saying that man is a
two-sided phenomenon, both mental and physical. Yet mind and body form a
unit, "indissolubly associated," so far as this life is concerned, and
because of this unity constantly reacting each part upon the other. So
that not only do mental states affect the physical, but the converse;
and this unfailing and inevitable interaction brings about, in case of
disease, what has been termed "a vicious circle."

Thus, tho a mental state may induce

<span id="page_88">p. 88</span>

disease, on the other hand the body, reacting upon unhygienic
conditions, may also induce disease.

The medical fraternity says that we are constantly taking into the
system from the air, water, and food millions of poisonous germs, which,
immediately they have gained entrance into the blood, set about to
destroy us. But just as a nation maintains a standing army to repel
invaders, so nature provides for this contingency by maintaining in the
blood millions of other small bodies which attack and destroy the
invaders. So long as the vitality or vital force is at par, they do
their work well; but if the vital force is lessened by any cause (and
bad sanitation among other things will do this), they are no longer
equal to the contest and the germs gain the victory. The blood then
becomes poisoned, the nutrition of the brain is impaired, and disease
follows.

So whether the cause be mental or environmental,

<span id="page_89">p. 89</span>

the result is the same, as has been said. Therefore diseases which
result from unhygienic conditions or the violation of nature's laws can
not be said to be mental, or so it seems. But since all disease affects
the mental state, it would seem to be closer to the fact to say that
*all diseases have a mental element*.

This is the position taken by a leading London physician and author,
and, if true, then all diseases are to some extent amenable to
mind-cure. And this would explain why such diseases as consumption have
been cured by a "change in the mentality," if it can be shown that such
cures were authentic.

It is, however, undeniable that a large number of ills may be traced to
mental or nervous origin, and to these one may certainly apply a
rational mind-cure, such as has been suggested in these pages.

In chapter first it was pointed out that the organized or classified
ideas which constitute

<span id="page_90">p. 90</span>

the mind are constantly reacting upon the body through the brain and
nervous system, thus tending to bring about a mental and physical
correspondence. Then if a "change in the mentality" or mental state is
all that is necessary to cure disease, the problem is simple enough. One
has merely to change his "state of mind," uproot pernicious, and
transplant therapeutic, ideas.

But, it may be objected, this is a very slow process; it takes years for
the habit of thought to write itself upon the body. This is perfectly
true. One may "right about face" in his thinking, strive to ignore pain,
divert his mind, and still have ample time to die of the disease before
appreciable results are realized. Such a method of self-help presents a
fine example of moral courage, will-power, and self-control, all
fundamental and necessary; yet in serious or chronic cases it appears to
fall short of the mark for these reasons.

<span id="page_91">p. 91</span>

In the first place, a persistent effort of will must be made to control
the thinking, lift oneself out of the "slough of despond," and ignore
pain. It demands unusual self-control, hence such a disciplined mind and
will as few persons possess; and, unhappily, pain by its very nature
tends to unbalance the mind, thus weakening the power of self-control.

And again, will, like every other mental and moral faculty, has a
physical basis. To put it into operation, therefore, requires both moral
and what we are accustomed to call physical stamina. But if the brain is
in a state of exhaustion, its reaction upon the mind will be feeble, and
hence sufficient energy will not be set free to carry out the behest of
the mind. It is, of course, possible to whip up the brain by force of
will; but it is like whipping up a jaded horse--his little spurt of
energy is followed by a still greater exhaustion.

Evidently, then, the slow physical realization

<span id="page_92">p. 92</span>

of a changed habit of thought and of maintaining the correct mental and
moral attitude in really serious disorders gives the problem a
disheartening aspect. But when we take into consideration the physical
side of the phenomenon called man, we get another point of view. If man
were a disembodied spirit, then certainly the cultivation and exercise
of his mental and moral faculties should keep him immune to disease. But
he has a "natural body," played upon like all the phenomena of nature by
natural forces, upon which he reacts; and the manner of this physical
reaction is of vital importance. We have already seen that it is
effected through the brain and nervous system; but the integrity of the
nervous system depends primarily upon the integrity of the brain; hence
there must be a normal condition of the brain if we are to obtain the
best possible physical reaction.

A carpenter can not build a house with

<span id="page_93">p. 93</span>

faulty tools nor a pianist give an artistic performance upon a decrepit
piano; and just so the finest, strongest mind can not manifest if its
medium, the brain, is debilitated, disorganized, or diseased.

Rational mind-cure, therefore, is of a twofold character: the mental
state or mode of thought must be reformed, and the brain must be built
up, or brought to the normal standard. Since the fundamental essentials
of health are "a sound brain \[cortex\] and a buoyant mind," we are
justified in assuming that those diseases which are not of subjective or
mental origin, or due to the entrance of poison into the blood, may be
traced to some organic change in the brain structure. For we have it on
high authority that "the surest way to check disease is to stimulate the
brain \[cortex\] and increase the mental energy."

The first step in rational mind-cure is unquestionably to change the
mode of thought;

<span id="page_94">p. 94</span>

but it is not enough to stop thinking depressing thoughts--a positive
attitude must be taken in order to render the mind buoyant. And this may
be done in several ways:

The method of "suggestion "--the daily affirmation of ideal health,
hope, and courage--is good, for the reason that the mind feeds upon such
ideas as harmonize with the inherent instinct of self-preservation. One
is working with nature.

The use of the imagination is equally good; it is a molding force. But
it requires mental concentration, which few practise or fully
understand, and therefore the simple self-suggestion is easier,
generally speaking.

The spiritual uplift which we call prayer is also an aid. For whatever
uplifts the soul exhilarates the mind, and we thus get a better mental
reaction. Its effect, however, is temporary, and it can not be relied
upon to effect a cure; else why were

<span id="page_95">p. 95</span>

not our martyred presidents restored to health?

Finally, one may try to cultivate a saner philosophy of life. Most of us
are too self-centered; we dwell too much upon our personal discomforts.
If therefore we can bring ourselves to see that suffering in some form
is the common lot; that it is a part of the discipline of life, which
chastens the soul and fits it for a nobler sphere of thought and action,
we shall go far toward cultivating a cheerful stoicism in regard to our
ills.

The second step in self-help is to reform the mode of life, thus
securing a better adjustment to external conditions. And here are needed
common sense and self-control. The man who persistently fritters away
his energy in emotional excesses; who delivers himself up to
self-indulgence; who deprives himself of fresh air, sunshine, sleep,
pure food, and pure water, or who works each day to the point of
exhaustion,

<span id="page_96">p. 96</span>

must suffer the penalty. The law of compensation can not be escaped. The
dyspeptic who persists in "bolting" his food, overloading his stomach,
or eating when fatigued can not be cured by any method known to man. If
you should have a sore on your hand and removed the scab as fast as it
formed, how long would it take for the sore to heal?

Finally, one must by a combined mental and physical treatment build up
the brain and thus improve the vitality.

To begin with, the brain is the hardest-worked part of the body, and the
tendency of our time is to overwork it. So then one should learn to rest
the brain. When the first symptoms of fatigue appear, stop; throw
yourself back in an easy chair or couch and relax the muscles. This
takes the tension off the brain. Every one knows that when the leg
muscles begin to ache, after walking some distance, how refreshed he
feels after a halt of a single

<span id="page_97">p. 97</span>

moment. Having relaxed the muscles, close the eyes, and let the thoughts
drift; or, better still, make the mind a blank. Five minutes, even three
minutes, will prove refreshing, and it should be resorted to at frequent
intervals daily in nervous exhaustion. The celebrated Dr. Pepper, of
Philadelphia, trained himself to fall asleep for two or three minutes at
frequent intervals throughout the day, and thus accomplished a vast
amount of work without fatigue. Just to relax the muscles, hold the
brain steady, and stop thinking gives this cerebral rest.

The second measure, both hygienic and mental, is *stimulating* the
brain, but this involves the third, which is *breathing*.

Some men and nearly all women breathe improperly. With the latter, tight
clothing which crowds the vital organs together and diminishes lung
space, and the wrong habit of sitting and standing, are responsible.
Only a small portion of the

<span id="page_98">p. 98</span>

lungs is used, and there is residual air which is rarely changed. And
yet "breath is life." We can live a number of days without food, several
days without water, but only a few moments without air.

Every schoolboy knows that the oxygen in the air is necessary to life.
Coming into contact with the blood through the thin membrane which lines
the air-cells of the lungs, it changes the impure, blue blood into
clean, red blood which pulses through the arteries, carrying the needed
elements of nutrition to every part; and it not only cleanses but
vitalizes the blood. Therefore, if one desires thoroughly to build
himself up, body and brain, he must learn to breathe.

It should be made a habit. If one is obliged to live an indoor life, he
should make it a practise to go to the door or window at frequent
intervals and take each time at least seven full, deep inhalations,
filling the lungs to their utmost

<span id="page_99">p. 99</span>

capacity. With head erect, and chest lifted, *hold* the inspired air for
a few seconds, to extract all the oxygen from it.

An excellent exercise is to place the feet side by side, clasp the
hands, and inhale and exhale regularly for several moments. The brain is
thus electrically charged.

Another: Stand erect, inhale deeply, then holding the breath drop the
head forward slightly, clench the hands, and tense all the muscles. This
stimulates the circulation of the brain.

For nervous debility and mental depression, deep breathing is
unexcelled, particularly if one applies imagination. Thus: when inhaling
*imagine* that you are taking into your system the life-giving oxygen;
that the invigorated blood is circulating in the brain, stimulating the
exhausted cells, and imparting to them new life. With a little practise,
one will soon be able to perceive the quickened circulation,

<span id="page_100">p. 100</span>

which will be followed by a sense of exhilaration.

Local self-treatment comes next in order. We have seen how the vital
force leaving the brain spreads throughout the body by means of
nerve-fibers; that it is the life-stimulus, since it keeps the internal
fires burning; that if it depreciates or is unequally distributed, the
weakest spot will be the first to suffer; and that only through its
activity can the circulation be kept normal and also the nutrition of
each and every part.

Manifestly, then, it is necessary to get control of this life-energy;
and it is by no means as difficult as at first appears.

Simply concentrating the attention or fixing the mind upon any organ or
part will, as before explained, direct the vital current to that spot.
The nerves (vasomotor) will be quickened into action, and the
blood-vessels will fill with an excess supply of blood. And as the blood
contains

<span id="page_101">p. 101</span>

the elements of nutrition, an improvement in nutrition will take place.
Changes will be made in the chemistry of the secretions, and in the
thermic and lymphatic functions. This becomes apparent to the
experimenter by the nervous agitation and the sensation of heat.
Sometimes there will be a prickling of the skin, or it will "twitch" or
"crawl," and again the throbbing of the blood in the arteries may be
perceived.

If one applies imagination or "suggestion" results are quicker. Thus:
One may form a mental picture of the vital force directed to a given
spot, as the gardener turns his hose at will upon the plants under his
care, and one may follow in imagination the course of the blood. And,
finally, the purpose of all this: a mental picture of the desired
result.

It takes longer in the saying than the doing. For once the practise is
initiated, the laws of association and habit reinstate

<span id="page_102">p. 102</span>

previous conditions with astonishing ease. A little practise will bring
any part of the body into almost instant communication with the mind.

As the physical processes are automatic it is well to work at regular
intervals. Advantage is thus taken of the tendency to reinstate previous
experience, and the worker will soon notice the state of preparedness of
both mind and body. Ere long the initial impulse will serve to set the
train in motion.

It means work--daily, persistent work--to get results. But if pills and
powders fail to cure you, what are you going to do about it? Live at a
"poor dying rate" or muster up courage to take a hand in your own
salvation?

The time required to secure results depends upon the conditions of life,
the age, the temperament, and the mental idiosyncrasy of the individual.
Obviously success in any field of effort is achieved

<span id="page_103">p. 103</span>

the more quickly the more enthusiasm and persistence one brings to it.

In most cases, it is wiser to cooperate with a progressive
physician--one who is broad-minded enough to recognize the mental factor
in disease, and knows how to take advantage of it.

Life is very complex; it is a balancing of many forces and the
adjustment of the organism to each and every one. Therefore many things
have to be taken into consideration: heredity, temperament, environment,
the mental attitude and the constitution, the age, the cause of the
existing condition, etc.; and these the physician ponders and weighs as
it is possible for very few of the laity to do. One may be working in
the dark, when the knowledge of a single fact might put him on the right
track.

Again, tho medicine does not always have the expected effect--sometimes
a very different one from that anticipated--the

<span id="page_104">p. 104</span>

patient will find that the effect of such medicine as the modern,
up-to-date physician may consider necessary will be greatly
*intensified* by the mental and physical treatment outlined in these
pages.

Finally, the action of one mind upon another is more immediately potent
than the reaction of the mind upon itself; it is true of all suggestions
or impressions received from without. The *rose* which I see and smell
produces a far stronger effect upon my brain and mind than the rose I
*imagine* I see and smell; that is, an ideal rose.

Thus, you may say to yourself daily: "I am well, and not only am I well,
but I feel well. Disease is mental; so if I think myself well, I am
well," etc.

Now this undoubtedly tends to buoy up the mind and you feel better in
consequence. In course of time, if persisted in, it will bring about an
improvement in the physical condition.

<span id="page_105">p. 105</span>

But suppose you meet a friend on the street. You are not feeling well,
and you know that you look as you feel; nevertheless, when your friend
exclaims, with a brightening glance: "How well you look! Why I never saw
any one improve as you have! Haven't you gained flesh?"--the effect is
magical. You feel instantly better and even doubt that you looked or
felt bad in the first instance.

On the contrary, suppose that your friend exclaims with anxiety and
dismay written in every line of his countenance: "How bad you look!
Aren't you any better? *Can't* the doctors do anything for you?" Your
courage drops below zero at once, and with it goes your vitality; and
the idea that you are ill fastens its tentacles upon your mind with an
unyielding grip. You not only feel worse, but you are worse. For some
one has wisely said: "We think as we feel and we feel as we think we
feel."

<span id="page_106">p. 106</span>

Hence it is not surprizing when our friends in the kindness of their
hearts inquire in doleful accents and grief-drawn faces as to our
rheumatism or neuralgia or jaundice that we part company with them in a
chastened and despondent frame of mind.

It is, however, a matter which each person must decide for
himself--whether or not he has the necessary knowledge and courage to
attack his case single-handed. Some friend or physician may put him on
his feet, but, when all is said, the permanence of his cure depends upon
himself; for if he drops back into the *old habit of thought and life*,
he will gradually reinstate the conditions which first laid him low, and
will naturally relapse into a similar state. He is wise, therefore, in
any event, if he sets about his own regeneration.

Moreover, it is a fine discipline for the mind. It strengthens the will,
develops self-reliance, self-control, and self-confidence.

<span id="page_107">p. 107</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> And when the
victory is won, it is virtually self-mastery.

And "whoso conquereth his own soul is greater than he who taketh a
city."
