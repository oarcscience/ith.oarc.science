*Out of the night that covers me,  
  Dark as the pit from pole to pole,  
I thank whatever Gods may be  
  For my unconquerable soul.*

*It matters not how strait the gate,  
  How charged with punishments the scroll,  
I am the master of my fate,  
  I am the captain of my soul!*  
                            --HENLEY.

### INTRODUCTION

THE Western world has been slow to recognize the power of the mind over
the body by reason of the fact that our philosophers from very early
times regarded the mind as an independent entity--a something to be
considered quite apart from the body.

"Mind can not move matter," they contended, because an impassable gulf
exists between the two; and therefore a mental fact can not possibly be
represented by a corresponding physical fact. The body, in their
thought, was simply the chosen tenement of the soul, and operated
independently of it. And this view in a modified form is maintained even
to the present day by the adherents of the old psychology or
metaphysical school.

But with the striking of the shackles from the insane by Dr. Pinel in
France, with the work of Dr. Tuke in England and Dr. Rush in America,
toward the latter half of the eighteenth century there sprang into being
a new psychology, based upon the study of nerve-tissue and brain-action.
The old psychology was speculative; the new is scientific. It has
exchanged theory for the microscope.

By this method it was soon demonstrated that the brain is the organ of
mind, and that the nervous system is the channel of communication
between the mind and the external world, or the means by which man is
put into relation with his environment.

The early phrenologists, in their attempts to localize brain function,
popularized the former idea, while the brain-physiologists proved
conclusively the indissoluble connection between the mind and the
nervous system. Meanwhile the histologists, by their discovery of the
nerve-cell and its

<span id="page_9">p. 9</span>

processes, discovered the physical basis of association of ideas and
memory.

Toward the middle of the nineteenth century German scientists took up
the problem; and Weber, with his law of variation, Fechner, with his
psychophysical law, and Wundt, by his researches in physiological
psychology, demonstrated the physical basis of mind. Henceforth
psychology was to be reckoned among the natural sciences.

As was to be expected, the charge of materialism has been flung at the
new by the adherents of the old school. With them, to deny the
independent existence of the soul was to "rule God out of the universe."
To affirm that mind and body are a unit is to negative the doctrine of
immortality.

While admitting the justice of the criticism of those extremists who
assert that "thought is a function of the brain" or that "the brain
secretes thought as the

<span id="page_10">p. 10</span>

liver secretes bile," it is unjust to that large body of monists who
hold that, tho mind and body must be regarded as a unit, the
soul-principle is the real *ego* or being, and the physical organism the
vehicle of its expression or embodiment. As Dr. Carus puts it, "Modern
psychology does not destroy the soul, but merely a false view of the
*ego*."

Accepting the position that the brain is the immediate organ of mind,
and that by means of his nervous system man gets into relation with his
environment, our inquiry as to the influence which mind may exert upon
matter may be conducted upon both rational and scientific lines.
