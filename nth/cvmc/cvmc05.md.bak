### THE NERVOUS SYSTEM

WITHOUT some knowledge of the nervous system, it is impossible to
understand fully how the mind may affect the body.

To begin with, as every schoolboy knows, each human being has a complex
system of nerves, the fountainhead of which is the brain. From the lower
part of the brain, in the back of the head, issues the spinal cord, a
bundle of nerve-fibers; and from this, nerves branch out and run to all
parts of the body, much as branches radiate from the trunk of a tree.

But every one does not know, or else has forgotten, that we have three
kinds of nerves--those that move the muscles, called motor nerves, those
which receive and

<span id="page_32">p. 32</span>

carry outside impressions to the brain and called sensory nerves, and
those that keep up the bodily activity, keep the fires burning--and
these are called sympathetic.

Nervous centers are distributed throughout the body, some along the
spinal column, others in the medulla oblongata. At certain places nerves
unite forming a plexus,--the cardiac, solar, and hypo-gastric plexuses.
The solar plexus is situated just back of the stomach and the
hypogastric plexus in the abdomen ([Fig. 3](#img_fig03).md).

"The real center of this system," says Dr. Carpenter, the English
brain-physiologist, "appears to lie in the medulla oblongata \[the bulb
at the apex of the spinal cord\], and has for its function the
regulation of the blood-supply to the different parts by its action on
the caliber of the arteries." That is, the great blood-channels, called
arteries, which carry the red blood away from the lungs, are surrounded
by a branch of these sympathetic nerves (called vasomotor),

which when they contract diminish the size of the channels and hence
decrease the amount of blood in them. If you should bandage your arm
tightly, you would get the same result; but in the case of the nerves of
which we are speaking, the action is automatic and controlled from the
center at the base of the brain.

Probably the reason why these nerves were first called "sympathetic" is
that if one nerve-center is shocked or does not properly conduct itself,
the others *sympathize*, or reflex the state of the first, and then all
sorts of troubles arise.

We have an analogous experience when heavy storms ravage the country. If
you "call up central" on the telephone, desiring to communicate with
some distant town, even tho you may "get central," you fail to reach
your friend or business associate because of crossed wires, broken
poles, etc.

The nervous system, like the telephone

<span id="page_34">p. 34</span>

company, has its central stations from which lines radiate, and any
little side line can get into touch with "central" if the intervening or
allied centrals are in good running order.

So then, if there is anything wrong with the central at the base of the
brain, the other centrals in the stomach or heart, for example, may
become more or less unsettled and behave in a hysterical manner.

But we have said that the automatic activity of these nerves is directed
from the center at the base of the brain, hence we may well ask, what
directs its action?

Now we are getting down to bed-rock.

The axiom of science that "no force is ever lost" was noted in chapter
first, and here we have an illustration of it. The force, chemical and
mental, which is generated by the brain through its reaction upon the
mind must go somewhere. So this force follows the nerve-fibers leading
from the top of the brain down to this center

<span id="page_35">p. 35</span>

of which we are speaking and quickens it into action. The center
automatically reacts upon the force and sends it flashing with
incredible speed down the spinal cord; and thence it follows the
branching nerves in every direction to the uttermost limits of the body;
what is unused by the body radiates into space ([Fig. 3](#img_fig03).md).

Dr. Benjamin Richardson, an English physician of the past century,
claimed to have traced this radiating energy to a distance of eighteen
inches from the skin; how much farther it extends we do not know.

Now, it is this vital energy spreading out over the body by means of the
nerves which keeps the fires of life burning. It keeps the heart
beating, the blood circulating, the stomach digesting; in fact, all the
physical processes are dependent upon it. It is therefore the
life-stimulus or force. And this can be easily seen. For if it ceases to
flow into the arm, for instance,

<span id="page_36">p. 36</span>

one not only can not move that member, but in course of time it withers.
We call it paralysis.

Now if this be true, health must depend primarily upon the quality,
quantity, and distribution of this vital energy; for if it depreciate in
any respect, all the physical processes are weakened. And if there be a
weak spot, there it will be felt to the greatest extent. And there
generally is a weak spot. Few, if any of us, are built like the
"Wonderful One-Hoss Shay"!

But there is still another phase of the matter.

We have seen that the nerve-center in the medulla regulates the supply
of blood in the blood-channels and also in the blood-vessels of every
organ or part. And this it does automatically according to the needs of
the various parts. Thus, in good health, the thought or smell of food
and the act of eating quicken the nerves of the stomach and cause the
blood-vessels to expand and

<span id="page_37">p. 37</span>

fill with blood. And then the digestive secretions pour into the
stomach, ready to digest the food. On the other hand, the thought of
danger so shocks the automatic center of the brain that the heart, with
which it is connected by large nerves, may be temporarily paralyzed.

Hence it must be clear that all the functions of the body are dependent
upon the activity of these nerves, which increase or cut off the
blood-supply according as the brain is affected. If there is nervous
exhaustion, the circulation is weak; consequently there ensue
"functional disorders."

Also it follows that if the supply of blood to any organ or part is
depleted, the nutrition of that part will be impaired. For the
blood-stream contains the elements of nutrition by means of which the
tissues are constantly built up. The daily tissue-waste can be repaired
only through the blood, and hence the ultimate integrity

<span id="page_38">p. 38</span>

of all parts depends upon the supply of blood, and also the quality of
the blood. For if the blood contains impurities, the parts can not be
renewed any more than you can repair a garment with rotten cloth or
build a house of decayed wood.

To sum up: From this sympathetic nerve-center at the base of the brain,
the mental or life-energy liberated by the brain passes by way of the
spinal cord and nerves to all parts of the body, giving life or
quickening into action each and every part. It controls the supply of
blood to all parts, varying it at need. Without it all physical
processes would cease; and upon its presence depends the circulation of
each part and consequently the healthy condition of each part.

And thus become apparent two fundamental essentials of health: the
quality, quantity, and distribution of the vital energy and the blood.

It is now plain what becomes of the force

<span id="page_39">p. 39</span>

generated by ideas in a state of action. First, they play upon the
brain, as the wind plays upon the water; this sets up waves or currents
in the brain-stuff; the molecules are displaced or rearranged, and this
sets free a new kind of force, which must be mental, since the mind
begot it.

This mental energy then flows down from the brain; like the sap rising
in the tree and penetrating to the outermost twigs, it flows by way of
the nervous system to the extreme limits of the body. And it is the
life-force, since, if it is impaired, all the vital processes are
weakened.
