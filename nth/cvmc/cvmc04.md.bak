### THE BRAIN

WE are accustomed to speak of the brain as the organ of mind, but it is
more than that; it is the engine which runs the body--a sort of
powerhouse, so to speak. The varied stock of ideas which beat upon it
furnishes the fuel. If those ideas are vigorous and numerous, the
engine, under normal conditions, works quickly and powerfully; but if
they are weak and slow, the fire burns low--the body is sluggish.

The brain, physiologically a mass of nervous tissue, delicate and
sensitive, is divided into two main parts: the cerebrum, the larger and
upper, the cerebellum, the smaller, situated below and behind ([Fig.
1](#img_fig01).md). The cerebrum consists of an outer zone, the cortex, or
gray matter, wherein lie the nerve

<span id="page_25">p. 25</span>

cells forming the various centers, and an inner portion, or white
substance, which consists of bundles of nerve-fibers leading from the
cortical cells and distributed over the entire body. The outer surface
is laid in folds or convolutions. The brain is the seat of intelligence,
the organ of the conscious mind. It must act before we can take note of
what is passing on.

Distributed over that portion of the cortex called the sensory area
([Fig. 2](#img_fig02).md) are the centers of sense-perception, which
receive, respectively, the impressions of sight, sound, touch, taste,
and smell. Another portion is called the motor area ([Fig.
2](#img_fig02).md). Here are situated the motor centers which send out over
the nerves, stimuli for producing motion. The frontal portion is known
as the higher psychical area ([Fig. 2](#img_fig02).md). The nerve-cells
comprising these three divisions do not work independently, but are
associated one with another. No cell

<span id="page_26">p. 26</span>

is isolated, but each is intimately connected with some other cell, or
cells, in motor and psychical area. All form part of a complex system.
The stimulation of one part brings into action many other parts.

Should I touch a hot iron, the nerves of the skin receive a shock which
produces a wave or current, carried along nerve-fibres to the spinal
cord, thence to the brain. Pain is felt. I know I have touched a hot
iron only after the stimulus has been received by the brain.

No one knows he hears a bell ring or a clock strike until the waves of
sound striking the ear-drum are transmitted by the auditory nerves to
the center of auditory perception. No one knows he is looking upon the
face of a friend until light waves striking the retina of the eye are
transmitted by the sight-nerves to the center of sight perception.

With the other parts of the brain we need not concern ourselves. As to
its

<span id="page_27">p. 27</span>

structure, we find that it is so sensitive and delicate that the
slightest shock will cause a movement of the particles; hence all its
various parts are very delicately balanced, it must be evident. They are
held in equilibrium, when all is well, by nature, but it is called
unstable equilibrium, because the balance is so easily disturbed. When
it is permanently disturbed, we say that the person is insane; when only
temporarily, we say he is irrational or hysterical.

The psychical area is so intimately connected with the various centers
of the other areas, that if it becomes unbalanced, these centers,
sympathizing as it were, become unbalanced. For instance, worry may
affect digestion and fear may affect motion. Most of us have experienced
either one or both of these conditions.

Strong emotions like anger, fear, grief, jealousy, and despair often
make temporary maniacs; for they powerfully affect and disturb the
equilibrium of the brain.

<span id="page_28">p. 28</span>

A thing so delicate is still the engine which runs the body. One could
not make the smallest movement, unless the mind supplied the force of
activity. Ideas in action induce a molecular and chemical change which
sets free energy not only to act but to keep the internal fires burning.

In order to heat your home you must have fuel, but you must also have a
furnace or engine. If you have good fuel and a good engine, you will
have a warm house. But suppose that your fuel is poor or scanty, then
the fire runs low. On the other hand, suppose that your engine is worn
out or poorly constructed--again you will be minus heat.

Just so, if there is a good stock of vigorous ideas there is sufficient
force to insure the chemical reactions of the body--keep up the
fire--but if the mind-force is weak or scanty, the fire runs low, the
body is sluggish. Feeble-minded persons are slow and clumsy in their
movements.

<span id="page_29">p. 29</span>

On the other hand, if the brain is debilitated or worn out, again the
fire runs low. So it works both ways--no fuel, no fire, or no engine, no
fire.

The state of the brain, therefore, must be of equal importance with the
state of the mind, as a leading English psychologist intimates when he
says: "The primary essentials of health are a sound brain and a buoyant
mind."

Finally, if the brain is the engine which runs the body, it must be in
communication with all parts; which is true. The brain-centers govern
all parts of the body; "every cell of the body has its ultimate
representation in a brain-cell," which is its governor or prime mover.
Thus, the cells of the stomach are represented by cells in the brain,
*with which they are connected by nerve-fibers;* and hence your
indigestion may not be caused by weakness of the stomach-cells, but by
debility of the brain-cells which correspond. If the brain-cells do

<span id="page_30">p. 30</span>

not work well, you can hardly expect those of the body to do so--poor
engine, poor fire.

Thus we are obliged to conclude that tho we must look to the mind for
the force to run the body, we must equally look to the brain as the
medium for the manifestation of that force. Nature's alchemy has
unvarying laws. The finest, the most vigorous mind can not work
effectively through a defective medium. As well try to grow figs of
thistles.
