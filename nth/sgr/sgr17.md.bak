*The Science of Getting Rich*, by Wallace Delois Wattles, \[1910\], at
Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### CHAPTER 16

#### Some Cautions, and Concluding Observations.

MANY people will scoff at the idea that there is an exact science of
getting rich; holding the impression that the supply of wealth is
limited, they will insist that social and governmental institutions must
be changed before even any considerable number of people can acquire a
competence.

But this is not true.

It is true that existing governments keep the masses in poverty, but
this is because the masses do not think and act in the Certain Way.

If the masses begin to move forward as suggested in this book, neither
governments nor industrial systems can check them; all systems must be
modified to accommodate the forward movement.

If the people have the Advancing Mind, have the Faith that they can
become rich, and move forward with the fixed purpose to become rich,
nothing can possibly keep them in poverty.

Individuals may enter upon the Certain Way at any time, and under any
government, and make themselves rich; and when any considerable number
of individuals do so under any government, they will cause the system to
be so modified as to open the way for others.

The more men who get rich on the competitive plane, the worse for
others; the more who get rich on the creative plane, the better for
others.

The economic salvation of the masses can only be accomplished by getting
a large number of people to practice the scientific method set down in
this book, and become rich. These will show others the way, and inspire
them with a desire for real life, with the faith that it can be
attained, and with the purpose to attain it.

For the present, however, it is enough to know that neither the
government under which you live nor the capitalistic or competitive
system of industry can keep you from getting rich. When you enter upon
the creative plane of thought you will rise above all these things and
become a citizen of another kingdom.

But remember that your thought must be held upon the creative plane; you
are never for an instant to be betrayed into regarding the supply as
limited, or into acting on the moral level of competition.

Whenever you do fall into old ways of thought, correct yourself
instantly; for when you are in the competitive mind, you have lost the
cooperation of the Mind of the Whole.

Do not spend any time in planning as to how you will meet possible
emergencies in the future, except as the necessary policies may affect
your actions today. You are concerned with doing today's work in a
perfectly successful manner, and not with emergencies which may arise
tomorrow; you can attend to them as they come.

Do not concern yourself with questions as to how you shall surmount
obstacles which may loom upon your business horizon, unless you can see
plainly that your course must be altered today in order to avoid them.

No matter how tremendous an obstruction may appear at a distance, you
will find that if you go on in the Certain Way it will disappear as you
approach it, or that a way over, though, or around it will appear.

No possible combination of circumstances can defeat a man or woman who
is proceeding to get rich along strictly scientific lines. No man or
woman who obeys the law can fail to get rich, any more than one can
multiply two by two and fail to get four.

Give no anxious thought to possible disasters, obstacles, panics, or
unfavorable combinations of circumstances; it is time enough to meet
such things when they present themselves before you in the immediate
present, and you will find that every difficulty carries with it the
wherewithal for its overcoming.

Guard your speech. Never speak of yourself, your affairs, or of anything
else in a discouraged or discouraging way.

Never admit the possibility of failure, or speak in a way that infers
failure as a possibility.

Never speak of the times as being hard, or of business conditions as
being doubtful. Times may be hard and business doubtful for those who
are on the competitive plane, but they can never be so for you; you can
create what you want, and you are above fear.

When others are having hard times and poor business, you will find your
greatest opportunities.

Train yourself to think of and to look upon the world as a something
which is Becoming, which is growing; and to regard seeming evil as being
only that which is undeveloped. Always speak in terms of advancement; to
do otherwise is to deny your faith, and to deny your faith is to lose
it.

Never allow yourself to feel disappointed. You may expect to have a
certain thing at a certain time, and not get it at that time; and this
will appear to you like failure.

But if you hold to your faith you will find that the failure is only
apparent.

Go on in the certain way, and if you do not receive that thing, you will
receive something so much better that you will see that the seeming
failure was really a great success.

A student of this science had set his mind on making a certain business
combination which seemed to him at the time to be very desirable, and he
worked for some, weeks to bring it about. When the crucial time came,
the thing failed in a perfectly inexplicable way; it was as if some
unseen influence had been working secretly against him. He was not
disappointed; on the contrary, he thanked God that his desire had been
overruled, and went steadily on with a grateful mind. In a few weeks an
opportunity so much better came his way that he would not have made the
first deal on any account; and he saw that a Mind which knew more than
he knew had prevented him from losing the greater good by entangling
himself with the lesser.

That is the way every seeming failure will work out for you, if you keep
your faith, hold to your purpose, have gratitude, and do, every day, all
that can be done that day, doing each separate act in a successful
manner.

*When you make a failure, it is because you have not asked for enough;
keep on, and a larger thing then you were seeking will certainly come to
you.* Remember this.

You will not fail because you lack the necessary talent to do what you
wish to do. If you go on as I have directed, you will develop all the
talent that is necessary to the doing of your work.

It is not within the scope of this book to deal with the science of
cultivating talent; but it is as certain and simple as the process of
getting rich.

However, do not hesitate or waver for fear that when you come to any
certain place you will fail for lack of ability; keep right on, and when
you come to that place, the ability will be furnished to you. The same
source of Ability which enabled the untaught Lincoln to do the greatest
work in government ever accomplished by a single man is open to you; you
may draw upon all the mind there is for wisdom to use in meeting the
responsibilities which are laid upon you. Go on in full faith.

Study this book. Make it your constant companion until you have mastered
all the ideas contained in it. While you are getting firmly established
in this faith, you will do well to give up most recreations and
pleasure; and to stay away from places where ideas conflicting with
these are advanced in lectures or sermons. Do not read pessimistic or
conflicting literature, or get into arguments upon the matter. Do very
little reading, outside of the writers mentioned in the Preface. Spend
most of your leisure time in contemplating your vision, and in
cultivating gratitude, and in reading this book. It contains all you
need to know of the science of getting rich; and you will find all the
essentials summed up in the following chapter.
