### PREFACE

LIFE AND ITS MYSTERIES first appeared in serial form in *The New Age*
magazine, and in response to numerous requests they are herewith
published in one volume with their permission. A few revisions have been
made and two chapters added entitled: "Future Life of Animals," and
"Answers to Questions."

This book attempts to explain in a clear and logical manner some of
life's mysteries. Mystery, of course is only absence of knowledge, for
when we understand a thing it ceases to be a mystery. But since we never
will know all, there will always be mysteries.

Some of the views expressed may not appeal to the orthodox or to the
materialist, but they will prove acceptable to those who are seeking
light regarding the deeper things of life—and to those who have in their
home a chair forevermore vacant.

For the subject of immortality is today engrossing the interest of
millions of people all over the world. Sorrow, suffering, devastation
and death are clearing the earth of error and superstition and preparing
the way for an influx of truth and knowledge of life beyond. When a
dearly beloved one departs from terrestrial scenes belief in a vague
hypothetical hereafter

is of scant value. THEN, only definite knowledge of factual immortally
is able to assuage grief and provide positive assurance of continued
life and love and certainty of reunion.

We devoutly hope that the thoughts presented in this book will acquaint
people with the truth of immortality; bring them comfort and
consolation, and a better understanding of life and its mysteries. The
reader, we hope, may have some of the peace and contentment which we
ourselves have derived from this knowledge. We are deeply grateful for
the help we have received from others in the preparation of this book.
