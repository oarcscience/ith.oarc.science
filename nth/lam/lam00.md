After long grief and pain<br />
To find the arms of my true love<br />
Round me once again.<br />
A shadow flits before me<br />
Not thou, but like to thee.<br />
Ah, Christ, that it were possible<br />
For one short hour to see<br />
The souls we loved, that they might tell us<br />
What and where they be!—<em>Tennyson</em>.</p></td>
