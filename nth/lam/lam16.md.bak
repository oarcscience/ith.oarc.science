### QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS

"*What Is Man?*"

Man is an immortal spirit temporarily inhabiting a material body. This
body is no more the real man than are the clothes he wears to cover it.
To understand man it is necessary to study vastly more than his outer
form. Men are begotten by God, and children of God are gods, just as
offspring of animals are animals.

 

"*How Many Bodies Has Man?*"

Man has two bodies, a material and a spiritual which Paul calls the
natural and unnatural body. At death man discards the physical and then
uses the spiritual body for his instrument of expression. Man has no
more use for seven or forty-seven bodies at one time than an animal has
for that many tails.

 

"*How Can One Unfold Their Spiritual Faculties?*"

Higher human faculties unfold naturally when the right kind of life is
lived conducive for their development. It is neither necessary nor
advisable

<span id="page_118">p. 118</span>

to form peculiar habits, or to have recourse to artificial means for
stimulating them. Spiritual thinking and spiritual living are the
requisites.

 

"*Where Do Child Prodigies Get Their Wisdom?*"

All prodigies are old in wisdom and full of experience. Their bodies are
new but the soul within that body has behind it an ancient history.
Prodigies and geniuses bring with them to earth the accumulated wisdom
of their past; their extraordinary endowment of skill or talent is the
result of innumerable years of preparatory study and struggle. A soul
without a past suddenly coming into existence with well defined mental
and moral characteristics and endowed with genius would be a freak, or a
contradiction of natural law. Great musicians, artists, mathematicians
do not begin or end their career on earth.

 

"*Where Did Life Originate?*"

Material scientists say from matter. Spiritual philosophers aver that
the First Cause of all things is spirit or God. According to the
ancients the first immigrants to earth came without material bodies,
after having accomplished missions on other planets while incarnated in
bodies adapted to conditions there prevailing. The regions of the far
North supposedly were first inhabited by physical humanity. The "fall of
man" into matter is a truth allegorically depicted in the Bible; his
becoming gradually

<span id="page_119">p. 119</span>

provided with clothes of skin and flesh, as a protection against the
injurious influences of his surroundings on earth.

 

"*Where Is God?*"

Since God is omnipresent, where is He not? In Him we live and move and
have our being, and we are this instant as close to Him as we ever will
be. Intimate awareness of His presence is realized when we know that God
and man are One.

 

"*What Is the Perfect Religion?*"

There is only *one* religion and that is perfect. *Love*. "Thou shalt
love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and
with all thy strength, and with all thy mind; and thy neighbor as
thyself."

 

"*Which Is the Most Important Law?*"

Love is the law that rules the universe and is the most important one.
He who observes this law is in harmony with all the others.

 

"*Why Does God Permit War?*"

When God endowed men with free will He undoubtedly knew they would abuse
it. However, He does not arbitrarily deprive them of it because they
choose to violate His commandments, but permits

<span id="page_120">p. 120</span>

men to slaughter one another and to reap the consequences thereof. By
the exercise of free will men make their own destiny, create their joy
or sorrow, and in this way gain wisdom. It is blasphemous for men to
pray to God to be "on their side" when they murder their brothers. If
they wish to be on God's side they must keep His laws. If men do not
like the suffering engendered by sin, they should cease sinning.

 

"*Are War Criminals Ever Punished?*"

Rarely if ever on earth, but there is a higher tribunal where all men
receive their just deserts. The real war criminals are seldom known to
the people who suffer the losses and bear the brunt of war, but they are
known to God. Rulers are only an effect of the people they govern, and
if the rulers are corrupt, so are the people. Until the masses become
competent to rule themselves they will be controlled and exploited by
politicians and profiteers. The key to liberation is in their own hands
but they are too blind to use it.

 

"*Why Does God Punish Innocent People?*"

Firstly, God never punishes anyone, innocent or guilty. We punish
ourselves by violating His laws. Secondly, there are no "innocent
victims." Sooner or later our deeds overtake us and we reap as we have
sown.

 

<span id="page_121">p. 121</span>

"*Why Are So Many Prayers Unanswered?*"

Many prayers are answered by remaining unanswered. Not all people pray
wisely and it would be to their detriment if their requests were
granted. All prayers are answered or unanswered according to the need
and the ultimate good of the petitioner. Many think that prayer will
change the laws of nature, or intervene between a cause and its effect.
Asking God to change the law is futile. The wise man prays for guidance,
to be shown how he can work himself out of the conditions he has
created. Nor does God do for us what we should do ourselves. God moves
when we move, and His hands are many hands. In heaven He works through
angels, and on earth through men.

"*Has Thought the Power to Heal?*"

As thought has the power to make people violently ill, and even kill
them, which it often has by bad news such as the passing of a loved one,
it assuredly has the power to alleviate and heal. All things have a
mental origin, and disease and its cure are no exceptions. Thought is
the creative power and can be used either constructively or
destructively. People can think themselves ill, unhappy and
unsuccessful, or they can create the opposite conditions. By changing
your opinion of yourself, you change yourself; and you certainly won't
accomplish much until you *think* you can.

 

<span id="page_122">p. 122</span>

"*What Is the Cause and Cure of Suffering?*"

All suffering arises from violation of law on the physical, moral,
mental or spiritual plane, whether committed knowingly or unknowingly,
ignorantly or deliberately. It is a corrective and educational
experience and altogether necessary. There can be no real emancipation
from suffering until men can no longer derive benefit from its
continuance. Ignorance is the cause of all suffering; and suffering will
cease when ignorance ceases.

 

"*Where Does Evil Originate?*"

Evil or the devil is no person but a force created for good but used for
evil. Nothing but good comes from the Infinite One or God. All evil has
its origin in man; so if man wants to see the devil he should look
within himself. Similarly, if he wants to find God he must see Him
within himself and his fellowmen.

 

"*Where Is Heaven and Hell?*"

Heaven and hell are not localities so much as states of consciousness;
current realities as well as future conditions. Remorse, regret and
persecuting memories are the essence of hell; peace, serenity and love
are the characteristics of heaven. Hell is the reflex of men's vices,
crimes and sins; heaven is the effect of living in harmony with the laws
of God. Every soul creates its own heaven or hell, here or

<span id="page_123">p. 123</span>

hereafter; death changes only the situation, not the condition of the
soul. "There is no rest for the wicked," is an actual truth. Repentance
does not remit consequences, nor does death obliterate memory which is
forever present torturing him with the past. God made this earth a
heaven, but man is doing his best to make it a hell.

"*Is Suicide a Disgrace?*"

Suicide or self-destruction is a sin. No man has the right to take his
own life or that of another. Furthermore, suicide accomplishes naught,
but is in reality a jump from the frying pan into the fire. The
individual does not run out on life as he supposes but finds himself
more alive than before. He is bound to earth with his obligations still
to meet, his problems to solve, his duties to perform, but no longer
having his physical body it takes him longer. Instead of liberation he
has found slavery. Those who are mentally ill when committing suicide
are not held accountable for the act, but they are responsible for the
conditions which prompted it. Such misguided individuals need help, and
above all knowledge of immortality which would deter them from making
such a dreadful mistake.

 

"*Is There Any Justice in This Life?*"

There is only *one* life and earthly expression is a brief portion of
it. One cannot look upon a single span of life and judge of anything. If
one were to

<span id="page_124">p. 124</span>

take one day from this life and ignore preceding and following days, it
wouldn't have the slightest plan or purpose. One must be acquainted with
the whole; and taken in its entirety there is absolute justice in life.

 

"*Who Are Angels?*"

Angels were human beings who once lived upon this earth and who have
attained the status of angel-hood. The soul continues its progress after
death and evolves until perfection has been regained. Angels, like human
beings, advance by rendering service to struggling mankind. "There
appeared an angel unto Jesus, from heaven, strengthening him"; now, as
then, they draw nigh in our hour of need and administer unto us.

 

THE END
