*The Quimby Manuscripts*, Phineas Parkhurst Quimby, ed. by Horatio W.
Dresser \[1921\], at Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Publisher's Note

The book as a whole contains an adequate statement of Quimby's original
theory as found in his manuscripts, 1846-65. The volume also contains
the writings, hitherto inaccessible, which Mrs. Eddy borrowed during her
stay in Portland as Quimby's patient. The editor is a son of Mrs. Julius
A. Dresser, who was the most active of Quimby's followers at the time
Mrs. Eddy was under treatment and who loaned Mrs. Eddy the copybooks
which made her acquainted with the Quimby manuscripts.
