II-IX. These eight pages contain facsimiles of four pages from one of
the copy-books into which the articles constituting "Volume I" were
copied after the Misses Ware had consulted Dr. Quimby concerning
revisions and changes. The articles from which these facsimiles are
taken are printed in full. (See Chapter XIV.) The dates show the time
when the articles were first written and copied. The changes made in the
text in the handwriting of Miss Emma Ware, were made at a later time,
probably in 1865, with a view to revising these articles for publication
in a volume of Dr. Quimby's writings. Similar emendations for the sake
of clearness were made in several volumes of the copy-books prior to Dr.
Quimby's death. These changes indicate the kind of revision approved of
by Dr. Quimby.

XII-XIV. These three pages reproduce the original notes of one of the
earliest articles, written prior to those included in the list of the
Quimby Manuscripts. The date is 1856. Here Dr. Quimby, writing
impersonally about his "new theory," states his opinion that it "could
be reduced to a science as correcting the error of any other science."
He declares that "all knowledge of disease is in the mind," that is, in
the "feeling," not in the body. Using the general term "fluids" to cover
not only the bodily fluids but the nervous activities, he speaks of the
mind as "spiritual matter" using this term interchangeably as if it
stood for mind or the matter which is nearest mind. The disease is due
to a "combination

<span id="page_446">p. 446</span>

of this matter," and the cure is accomplished by establishing a
different combination. In the last of these three pages Quimby says that
"truth restores the mind and changes the fluids."

These pages are without revisions save by the author himself. No
corrections have been made in the spelling. Dr Quimby's statements show
that even in this crude early formulation of his theory he already
possessed the elements of his "Science."

XV-XVI. Facsimiles of first notes for other articles, characteristic of
many of the originals of later writings.
