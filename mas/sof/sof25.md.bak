### Symbolism of the Corner-Stone.

We come next, in a due order of precedence, to the consideration of the
symbolism connected with an important ceremony in the ritual of the
first degree of Masonry, which refers to the north-east corner of the
lodge. In this ceremony the candidate becomes the representative of a
spiritual corner-stone. And hence, to thoroughly comprehend the true
meaning of the emblematic ceremony, it is essential that we should
investigate the symbolism of the *corner-stone*.

The corner-stone, [107](sof37.htm#xref_107.md) as the foundation on which
the entire building is supposed to rest, is, of course, the most
important stone in the whole edifice. It is, at least, so considered by
operative masons. It is laid with impressive ceremonies; the assistance
of speculative masons is often, and always ought to be, invited, to give
dignity to the occasion; and the event is viewed by the workmen as an
important era in the construction of the
edifice. [108](sof37.htm#xref_108.md)

In the rich imagery of Orientalism, the corner-stone is frequently
referred to as the appropriate symbol of a chief or prince who is the
defence and bulwark of his people, and more particularly in Scripture,
as denoting that promised Messiah who was to be the sure prop and
support of all who should put their trust in his divine
mission. [109](sof37.htm#xref_109.md)

To the various properties that are necessary to constitute a true
corner-stone,--its firmness and durability, its perfect form, and its
peculiar position as the connecting link between the walls,--we must
attribute the important character that it has assumed in the language of
symbolism. Freemasonry, which alone, of all existing institutions, has
preserved this ancient and universal language, could not, as it may well
be supposed, have neglected to adopt the corner-stone among its most
cherished and impressive symbols; and hence it has referred to it many
of its most significant lessons of morality and truth.

I have already alluded to that peculiar mode of masonic symbolism by
which the speculative mason is supposed to be engaged in the
construction of a spiritual temple, in imitation of, or, rather, in
reference to, that material one which was erected by his operative
predecessors at Jerusalem. Let us again, for a few moments, direct our
attention to this important fact, and revert to the connection which
originally existed between the operative and speculative divisions of
Freemasonry. This is an essential introduction to any inquiry into the
symbolism of the corner-stone.

The difference between operative and speculative Masonry is simply
this--that while the former was engaged in the construction of a
material temple, formed, it is true, of the most magnificent materials
which the quarries of Palestine, the mountains of Lebanon, and the
golden shores of Ophir could contribute, the latter occupies itself in
the erection of a spiritual house,--a house not made with hands,--in
which, for stones and cedar, and gold and precious stones, are
substituted the virtues of the heart, the pure emotions of the soul, the
warm affections gushing forth from the hidden fountains of the spirit,
so that the very presence of Jehovah, our Father and our God, shall be
enshrined within us as his Shekinah was in the holy of holies of the
material temple at Jerusalem.

The Speculative Mason, then, if he rightly comprehends the scope and
design of his profession, is occupied, from his very first admission
into the order until the close of his labors and his life,--and the true
mason's labor ends only with his life,--in the construction, the
adornment, and the completion of this spiritual temple of his body. He
lays its foundation in a firm belief and an unshaken confidence in the
wisdom, power, and goodness of God. This is his first step. Unless his
trust is in God, and in him only, he can advance no further than the
threshold of initiation. And then he prepares his materials with the
gauge and gavel of Truth, raises the walls by the plumb-line of
Rectitude, squares his work with the square of Virtue, connects the
whole with the cement of Brotherly Love, and thus skilfullv erects the
living edifice of thoughts, and words, and deeds, in accordance with the
designs laid down by the Master Architect of the universe in the great
Book of Revelation.

The aspirant for masonic light--the Neophyte--on his first entrance
within our sacred porch, prepares himself for this consecrated labor of
erecting within his own bosom a fit dwelling-place for the Divine
Spirit, and thus commences the noble work by becoming himself the
corner-stone on which this spiritual edifice is to be erected.

Here, then, is the beginning of the symbolism of the corner-stone; and
it is singularly curious to observe how every portion of the archetype
has been made to perform its appropriate duty in thoroughly carrying out
the emblematic allusions.

As, for example, this symbolic reference of the corner-stone of a
material edifice to a mason, when, at his first initiation, he commences
the intellectual task of erecting a spiritual temple in his heart, is
beautifully sustained in the allusions to all the various parts and
qualities which are to be found in a "well-formed, true and trusty"
corner-stone. [110](sof37.htm#xref_110.md) Its form and substance are both
seized by the comprehensive grasp of the symbolic science.

Let us trace this symbolism in its minute details. And, first, as to the
form of the corner-stone.

The corner-stone of an edifice must be perfectly square on its surfaces,
lest, by a violation of this true geometric figure, the walls to be
erected upon it should deviate from the required line of
perpendicularity which can alone give strength and proportion to the
building.

Perfectly square on its surfaces, it is, in its form and solid contents,
a cube. Now, the square and the cube are both important and significant
symbols.

The square is an emblem of morality, or the strict performance of every
duty. [111](sof37.htm#xref_111.md) Among the Greeks, who were a highly
poetical and imaginative people, the square was deemed a figure of
perfection, and the ἀνὴρ τετράγωνος--"the square or cubical man," as the
words may be translated--was a term used to designate a man of unsullied
integrity. Hence one of their most eminent
metaphysicians [112](sof37.htm#xref_112.md) has said that "he who valiantly
sustains the shocks of adverse fortune, demeaning himself uprightly, is
truly good and of a square posture, without reproof; and he who would
assume such a square posture should often subject himself to the
perfectly square test of justice and integrity."

The cube, in the language of symbolism, denotes
truth. [113](sof37.htm#xref_113.md) Among the pagan mythologists, Mercury,
or Hermes, was always represented by a cubical stone, because he was the
type of truth, [114](sof37.htm#xref_114.md) and the same form was adopted
by the Israelites in the construction of the tabernacle, which was to be
the dwelling-place of divine truth.

And, then, as to its material: This, too, is an essential element of all
symbolism. Constructed of a material finer and more polished than that
which constitutes the remainder of the edifice, often carved with
appropriate devices and fitted for its distinguished purpose by the
utmost skill of the sculptor's art, it becomes the symbol of that beauty
of holiness with which the Hebrew Psalmist has said that we are to
worship Jehovah. [115](sof37.htm#xref_115.md)

The ceremony, then, of the north-east corner of the lodge, since it
derives all its typical value from this symbolism of the corner-stone,
was undoubtedly intended to portray, in this consecrated language, the
necessity of integrity and stability of conduct, of truthfulness and
uprightness of character, and of purity and holiness of life, which,
just at that time and in that place, the candidate is most impressively
charged to maintain.

But there is also a symbolism about the position of the corner-stone,
which is well worthy of attention. It is familiar to every one,--even to
those who are without the pale of initiation,--that the custom of laying
the corner-stones of public buildings has always been performed by the
masonic order with peculiar and impressive ceremonies, and that this
stone is invariably deposited in the north-east corner of the foundation
of the intended structure. Now, the question naturally suggests itself,
Whence does this ancient and invariable usage derive its origin? Why may
not the stone be deposited in any other corner or portion of the
edifice, as convenience or necessity may dictate? The custom of placing
the foundation-stone in the north-east corner must have been originally
adopted for some good and sufficient reason; for we have a right to
suppose that it was not an arbitrary
selection. [116](sof37.htm#xref_116.md) Was it in reference to the ceremony
which takes place in the lodge? Or is that in reference to the position
of the material stone? No matter which has the precedence in point of
time, the principle is the same. The position of the stone in the
north-east corner of the building is altogether symbolic, and the
symbolism exclusively alludes to certain doctrines which are taught in
the speculative science of Masonry.

The interpretation, I conceive, is briefly this: Every Speculative Mason
is familiar with the fact that the east, as the source of material
light, is a symbol of his own order, which professes to contain within
its bosom the pure light of truth. As, in the physical world, the
morning of each day is ushered into existence by the reddening dawn of
the eastern sky, whence the rising sun dispenses his illuminating and
prolific rays to every portion of the visible horizon, warming the whole
earth with his embrace of light, and giving new-born life and energy to
flower and tree, and beast and man, who, at the magic touch, awake from
the sleep of darkness, so in the moral world, when intellectual night
was, in the earliest days, brooding over the world, it was from the
ancient priesthood living in the east that those lessons of God, of
nature, and of humanity first emanated, which, travelling westward,
revealed to man his future destiny, and his dependence on a superior
power. Thus every new and true doctrine, coming from these "wise men of
the east," was, as it were, a new day arising, and dissipating the
clouds of intellectual darkness and error. It was a universal opinion
among the ancients that the first learning came from the east; and the
often-quoted line of Bishop Berkeley, that--

> "Westward the course of empire takes its way"--

is but the modern utterance of an ancient thought, for it was always
believed that the empire of truth and knowledge was advancing from the
east to the west.

Again: the north, as the point in the horizon which is most remote from
the vivifying rays of the sun when at his meridian height, has, with
equal metaphorical propriety, been called the place of darkness, and is,
therefore, symbolic of the profane world, which has not yet been
penetrated and illumined by the intellectual rays of masonic light. All
history concurs in recording the fact that, in the early ages of the
world, its northern portion was enveloped in the most profound moral and
mental darkness. It was from the remotest regions of Northern Europe
that those barbarian hordes "came down like the wolf on the fold," and
devastated the fair plains of the south, bringing with them a dark
curtain of ignorance, beneath whose heavy folds the nations of the world
lay for centuries overwhelmed. The extreme north has ever been,
physically and intellectually, cold, and dark, and dreary. Hence, in
Masonry, the north has ever been esteemed the place of darkness; and, in
obedience to this principle, no symbolic light is allowed to illumine
the northern part of the lodge.

The east, then, is, in Masonry, the symbol of the order, and the north
the symbol of the profane world.

Now, the spiritual corner-stone is deposited in the north-east corner of
the lodge, because it is symbolic of the position of the neophyte, or
candidate, who represents it in his relation to the order and to the
world. From the profane world he has just emerged. Some of its
imperfections are still upon him; some of its darkness is still about
him; he as yet belongs in part to the north. But he is striving for
light and truth; the pathway upon which he has entered is directed
towards the east. His allegiance, if I may use the word, is divided. He
is not altogether a profane, nor altogether a mason. If he were wholly
in the world, the north would be the place to find him--the north, which
is the reign of darkness. If he were wholly in the order,--a Master
Mason,--the east would have received him--the east, which is the place
of light. But he is neither; he is an Apprentice, with some of the
ignorance of the world cleaving to him, and some of the light of the
order beaming upon him. And hence this divided allegiance--this double
character--this mingling of the departing darkness of the north with the
approaching brightness of the east--is well expressed, in our symbolism,
by the appropriate position of the spiritual corner-stone in the
north-east corner of the lodge. One surface of the stone faces the
north, and the other surface faces the east. It is neither wholly in the
one part nor wholly in the other, and in so far it is a symbol of
initiation not fully developed--that which is incomplete and imperfect,
and is, therefore, fitly represented by the recipient of the first
degree, at the very moment of his initiation. [117](sof37.htm#xref_117.md)

But the strength and durability of the corner-stone are also eminently
suggestive of symbolic ideas. To fulfil its design as the foundation and
support of the massive building whose erection it precedes, it should be
constructed of a material which may outlast all other parts of the
edifice, so that when that "eternal ocean whose waves are years" shall
have ingulfed all who were present at the construction of the building
in the vast vortex of its ever-flowing current; and when generation
after generation shall have passed away, and the crumbling stones of the
ruined edifice shall begin to attest the power of time and the
evanescent nature of all human undertakings, the corner-stone will still
remain to tell, by its inscriptions, and its form, and its beauty, to
every passer-by, that there once existed in that, perhaps then desolate,
spot, a building consecrated to some noble or some sacred purpose by the
zeal and liberality of men who now no longer live.

So, too, do this permanence and durability of the corner-stone, in
contrast with the decay and ruin of the building in whose foundations it
was placed, remind the mason that when this earthly house of his
tabernacle shall have passed away, he has within him a sure foundation
of eternal life--a corner-stone of immortality--an emanation from that
Divine Spirit which pervades all nature, and which, therefore, must
survive the tomb, and rise, triumphant and eternal, above the decaying
dust of death and the grave. [118](sof37.htm#xref_118.md)

It is in this way that the student of masonic symbolism is reminded by
the corner-stone--by its form, its position, and its permanence--of
significant doctrines of duty, and virtue, and religious truth, which it
is the great object of Masonry to teach.

But I have said that the material corner-stone is deposited in its
appropriate place with solemn rites and ceremonies, for which the order
has established a peculiar ritual. These, too, have a beautiful and
significant symbolism, the investigation of which will next attract our
attention.

And here it may be observed, in passing, that the accompaniment of such
an act of consecration to a particular purpose, with solemn rites and
ceremonies, claims our respect, from the prestige that it has of all
antiquity. A learned writer on symbolism makes, on this subject, the
following judicious remarks, which may be quoted as a sufficient defence
of our masonic ceremonies:--

"It has been an opinion, entertained in all past ages, that by the
performance of certain acts, things, places, and persons acquire a
character which they would not have had without such performances. The
reason is plain: certain acts signify firmness of purpose, which, by
consigning the object to the intended use, gives it, in the public
opinion, an accordant character. This is most especially true of things,
places, and persons connected with religion and religious worship. After
the performance of certain acts or rites, they are held to be altogether
different from what they were before; they acquire a sacred character,
and in some instances a character absolutely divine. Such are the
effects imagined to be produced by religious dedication."
 [119](sof37.htm#xref_119.md)

The stone, therefore, thus properly constructed, is, when it is to be
deposited by the constituted authorities of our order, carefully
examined with the necessary implements of operative masonry,--the
square, the level, and the plumb,--and declared to be "well-formed,
true, and trusty." This is not a vain nor unmeaning ceremony. It teaches
the mason that his virtues are to be tested by temptation and trial, by
suffering and adversity, before they can be pronounced by the Master
Builder of souls to be materials worthy of the spiritual building of
eternal life, fitted "as living stones, for that house not made with
hands, eternal in the heavens." But if he be faithful, and withstand
these trials,--if he shall come forth from these temptations and
sufferings like pure gold from the refiner's fire,--then, indeed, shall
he be deemed "well-formed, true, and trusty," and worthy to offer "unto
the Lord an offering in righteousness."

In the ceremony of depositing the corner-stone, the sacred elements of
masonic consecration are then produced, and the stone is solemnly set
apart by pouring corn, wine, and oil upon its surface. Each of these
elements has a beautiful significance in our symbolism.

Collectively, they allude to the Corn of Nourishment, the Wine of
Refreshment, and the Oil of Joy, which are the promised rewards of a
faithful and diligent performance of duty, and often specifically refer
to the anticipated success of the undertaking whose incipiency they have
consecrated. They are, in fact, types and symbols of all those abundant
gifts of Divine Providence for which we are daily called upon to make an
offering of our thanks, and which are enumerated by King David, in his
catalogue of blessings, as "wine that maketh glad the heart of man, and
oil to make his face to shine, and bread which strengtheneth man's
heart."

"Wherefore, my brethren," says Harris, "do you carry *corn, wine, and
oil* in your processions, but to remind you that in the pilgrimage of
human life you are to impart a portion of your bread to feed the hungry,
to send a cup of your wine to cheer the sorrowful, and to pour the
healing oil of your consolation into the wounds which sickness hath made
in the bodies, or affliction rent in the hearts, of your
fellow-travellers?"  [120](sof37.htm#xref_120.md)

But, individually, each of these elements of consecration has also an
appropriate significance, which is well worth investigation.

Corn, in the language of Scripture, is an emblem of the resurrection,
and St. Paul, in that eloquent discourse which is so familiar to all, as
a beautiful argument for the great Christian doctrine of a future life,
adduces the seed of grain, which, being sown, first dieth, and then
quickeneth, as the appropriate type of that corruptible which must put
on incorruption, and of that mortal which must assume immortality. But,
in Masonry, the sprig of acacia, for reasons purely masonic, has been
always adopted as the symbol of immortality, and the ear of corn is
appropriated as the symbol of plenty. This is in accordance with the
Hebrew derivation of the word, as well as with the usage of all ancient
nations. The word *dagan*, דנו which signifies *corn*, is derived from
the verb *dagah*, דנה, *to increase, to multiply*, and in all the
ancient religions the horn or vase, filled with fruits and with grain,
was the recognized symbol of plenty. Hence, as an element of
consecration, corn is intended to remind us of those temporal blessings
of life and health, and comfortable support, which we derive from the
Giver of all good, and to merit which we should strive, with "clean
hands and a pure heart," to erect on the corner-stone of our initiation
a spiritual temple, which shall be adorned with the "beauty of
holiness."

Wine is a symbol of that inward and abiding comfort with which the heart
of the man who faithfully performs his part on the great stage of life
is to be refreshed; and as, in the figurative language of the East,
Jacob prophetically promises to Judah, as his reward, that he shall wash
his garments in wine, and his clothes in the blood of the grape, it
seems intended, morally, to remind us of those immortal refreshments
which, when the labors of this earthly lodge are forever closed, we
shall receive in the celestial lodge above, where the G.A.O.T.U. forever
presides.

Oil is a symbol of prosperity, and happiness, and joy. The custom of
anointing every thing or person destined for a sacred purpose is of
venerable antiquity. [121](sof37.htm#xref_121.md) The statues of the
heathen deities, as well as the altars on which the sacrifices were
offered to them, and the priests who presided over the sacred rites,
were always anointed with perfumed ointment, as a consecration of them
to the objects of religious worship.

When Jacob set up the stone on which he had slept in his journey to
Padan-aram, and where he was blessed with the vision of ascending and
descending angels, he anointed it with oil, and thus consecrated it as
an altar to God. Such an inunction was, in ancient times, as it still
continues to be in many modern countries and contemporary religions, a
symbol of the setting apart of the thing or person so anointed and
consecrated to a holy purpose.

Hence, then, we are reminded by this last impressive ceremony, that the
cultivation of virtue, the practice of duty, the resistance of
temptation, the submission to suffering, the devotion to truth, the
maintenance of integrity, and all those other graces by which we strive
to fit our bodies, as living stones, for the spiritual building of
eternal life, must, after all, to make the object effectual and the
labor successful, be consecrated by a holy obedience to God's will and a
firm reliance on God's providence, which alone constitute the chief
corner-stone and sure foundation, on which any man can build with the
reasonable hope of a prosperous issue to his work.

It may be noticed, in concluding this topic, that the corner-stone seems
to be peculiarly a Jewish symbol. I can find no reference to it in any
of the ancient pagan rites, and the EBEN PINAH, the *corner-stone*,
which is so frequently mentioned in Scripture as the emblem of an
important personage, and most usually, in the Old Testament, of the
expected Messiah, appears, in its use in Masonry, to have had, unlike
almost every other symbol of the order, an exclusively temple origin.
