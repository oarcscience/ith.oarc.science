## III.

### The Primitive Freemasonry of Antiquity.

The next important historical epoch which demands our attention is that
connected with what, in sacred history, is known as the dispersion at
Babel. The brightness of truth, as it had been communicated by Noah,
became covered, as it were, with a cloud. The dogmas of the unity of God
and the immortality of the soul were lost sight of, and the first
deviation from the true worship occurred in the establishment of
Sabianism, or the worship of the sun, moon, and stars, among some
peoples, and the deification of men among others. Of these two
deviations, Sabianism, or sun-worship, was both the earlier and the more
generally diffused. [5](sof37.htm#xref_5.md) "It seems," says the learned
Owen, "to have had its rise from some broken traditions conveyed by the
patriarchs touching the dominion of the sun by day and of the moon by
night." The mode in which this old system has been modified and
spiritually symbolized by Freemasonry will be the subject of future
consideration.

But Sabianism, while it was the most ancient of the religious
corruptions, was, I have said, also the most generally diffused; and
hence, even among nations which afterwards adopted the polytheistic
creed of deified men and factitious gods, this ancient sun-worship is
seen to be continually exerting its influences. Thus, among the Greeks,
the most refined people that cultivated hero-worship, Hercules was the
sun, and the mythologic fable of his destroying with his arrows the
many-headed hydra of the Lernaean marshes was but an allegory to denote
the dissipation of paludal malaria by the purifying rays of the orb of
day. Among the Egyptians, too, the chief deity, Osiris, was but another
name for the sun, while his arch-enemy and destroyer, Typhon, was the
typification of night, or darkness. And lastly, among the Hindus, the
three manifestations of their supreme deity, Brahma, Siva, and Vishnu,
were symbols of the rising, meridian, and setting sun.

This early and very general prevalence of the sentiment of sun-worship
is worthy of especial attention on account of the influence that it
exercised over the spurious Freemasonry of antiquity, of which I am soon
to speak, and which is still felt, although modified and Christianized
in our modern system. Many, indeed nearly all, of the masonic symbols of
the present day can only be thoroughly comprehended and properly
appreciated by this reference to sun-worship.

This divine truth, then, of the existence of one Supreme God, the Grand
Architect of the Universe, symbolized in Freemasonry as the TRUE WORD,
was lost to the Sabians and to the polytheists who arose after the
dispersion at Babel, and with it also disappeared the doctrine of a
future life; and hence, in one portion of the masonic ritual, in
allusion to this historic fact, we speak of "the lofty tower of Babel,
where language was confounded and Masonry lost."

There were, however, some of the builders on the plain of Shinar who
preserved these great religious and masonic doctrines of the unity of
God and the immortality of the soul in their pristine purity. These were
the patriarchs, in whose venerable line they continued to be taught.
Hence, years after the dispersion of the nations at Babel, the world
presented two great religious sects, passing onward down the stream of
time, side by side, yet as diverse from each other as light from
darkness, and truth from falsehood.

One of these lines of religious thought and sentiment was the idolatrous
and pagan world. With it all masonic doctrine, at least in its purity,
was extinct, although there mingled with it, and at times to some extent
influenced it, an offshoot from the other line, to which attention will
be soon directed.

The second of these lines consisted, as has already been said, of the
patriarchs and priests, who preserved in all their purity the two great
masonic doctrines of the unity of God and the immortality of the soul.

This line embraced, then, what, in the language of recent masonic
writers, has been designated as the *Primitive Freemasonry of
Antiquity*.

Now, it is by no means intended to advance any such gratuitous and
untenable theory as that proposed by some imaginative writers, that the
Freemasonry of the patriarchs was in its organization, its ritual, or
its symbolism, like the system which now exists. We know not indeed,
that it had a ritual, or even a symbolism. I am inclined to think that
it was made up of abstract propositions, derived from antediluvian
traditions. Dr. Oliver thinks it probable that there were a few symbols
among these Primitive and Pure Freemasons, and he enumerates among them
the serpent, the triangle, and the point within a circle; but I can find
no authority for the supposition, nor do I think it fair to claim for
the order more than it is fairly entitled to, nor more than it can be
fairly proved to possess. When Anderson calls Moses a Grand Master,
Joshua his Deputy, and Aholiab and Bezaleel Grand Wardens, the
expression is to be looked upon simply as a *façon de parler*, a mode of
speech entirely figurative in its character, and by no means intended to
convey the idea which is entertained in respect to officers of that
character in the present system. It would, undoubtedly, however, have
been better that such language should not have been used.

All that can be claimed for the system of Primitive Freemasonry, as
practised by the patriarchs, is, that it embraced and taught the two
great dogmas of Freemasonry, namely, the unity of God, and the
immortality of the soul. It may be, and indeed it is highly probable,
that there was a secret doctrine, and that this doctrine was not
indiscriminately communicated. We know that Moses, who was necessarily
the recipient of the knowledge of his predecessors, did not publicly
teach the doctrine of the immortality of the soul. But there was among
the Jews an oral or secret law which was never committed to writing
until after the captivity; and this law, I suppose, may have contained
the recognition of those dogmas of the Primitive Freemasonry.

Briefly, then, this system of Primitive Freemasonry,--without ritual or
symbolism, that has come down to us, at least,--consisting solely of
traditionary legends, teaching only the two great truths already alluded
to, and being wholly speculative in its character, without the slightest
infusion of an operative element, was regularly transmitted through the
Jewish line of patriarchs, priests, and kings, without alteration,
increase, or diminution, to the time of Solomon, and the building of the
temple at Jerusalem.

Leaving it, then, to pursue this even course of descent, let us refer
once more to that other line of religious history, the one passing
through the idolatrous and polytheistic nations of antiquity, and trace
from it the regular rise and progress of another division of the masonic
institution, which, by way of distinction, has been called the *Spurious
Freemasonry of Antiquity*.
