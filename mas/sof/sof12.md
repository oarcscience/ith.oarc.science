### The System of Symbolic Instuction.

The lectures of the English lodges, which are far more philosophical
than our own,--although I do not believe that the system itself is in
general as philosophically studied by our English brethren as by
ourselves,--have beautifully defined Freemasonry to be "a science of
morality veiled in allegory and illustrated by symbols." But allegory
itself is nothing else but verbal symbolism; it is the symbol of an
idea, or of a series of ideas, not presented to the mind in an objective
and visible form, but clothed in language, and exhibited in the form of
a narrative. And therefore the English definition amounts, in fact, to
this: that *Freemasonry is a science of morality, developed and
inculcated by the ancient method of symbolism*. It is this peculiar
character as a symbolic institution, this entire adoption of the method
of instruction by symbolism, which gives its whole identity to
Freemasonry, and has caused it to differ from every other association
that the ingenuity of man has devised. It is this that has bestowed upon
it that attractive form which has always secured the attachment of its
disciples and its own perpetuity.

The Roman Catholic church [37](sof37.htm#xref_37.md) is, perhaps, the only
contemporaneous institution which continues to cultivate, in any degree,
the beautiful system of symbolism. But that which, in the Catholic
church, is, in a great measure, incidental, and the fruit of
development, is, in Freemasonry, the very life-blood and soul of the
institution, born with it at its birth, or, rather, the germ from which
the tree has sprung, and still giving it support, nourishment, and even
existence. Withdraw from Freemasonry its symbolism, and you take from
the body its soul, leaving behind nothing but a lifeless mass of effete
matter, fitted only for a rapid decay.

Since, then, the science of symbolism forms so important a part of the
system of Freemasonry, it will be well to commence any discussion of
that subject by an investigation of the nature of symbols in general.

There is no science so ancient as that of
symbolism, [38](sof37.htm#xref_38.md) and no mode of instruction has ever
been so general as was the symbolic in former ages. "The first learning
in the world," says the great antiquary, Dr. Stukely, "consisted chiefly
of symbols. The wisdom of the Chaldeans, Phoenicians, Egyptians, Jews,
of Zoroaster, Sanchoniathon, Pherecydes, Syrus, Pythagoras, Socrates,
Plato, of all the ancients that is come to our hand, is symbolic." And
the learned Faber remarks, that "allegory and personification were
peculiarly agreeable to the genius of antiquity, and the simplicity of
truth was continually sacrificed at the shrine of poetical decoration."

In fact, man's earliest instruction was by
symbols. [39](sof37.htm#xref_39.md) The objective character of a symbol is
best calculated to be grasped by the infant mind, whether the infancy of
that mind be considered *nationally* or *individually*. And hence, in
the first ages of the world, in its infancy, all propositions,
theological, political, or scientific, were expressed in the form of
symbols. Thus the first religions were eminently symbolical, because, as
that great philosophical historian, Grote, has remarked, "At a time when
language was yet in its infancy, visible symbols were the most vivid
means of acting upon the minds of ignorant hearers."

Again: children receive their elementary teaching in symbols. "A was an
Archer;" what is this but symbolism? The archer becomes to the infant
mind the symbol of the letter A, just as, in after life, the letter
becomes, to the more advanced mind, the symbol of a certain sound of the
human voice. [40](sof37.htm#xref_40.md) The first lesson received by a
child in acquiring his alphabet is thus conveyed by symbolism. Even in
the very formation of language, the medium of communication between man
and man, and which must hence have been an elementary step in the
progress of human improvement, it was found necessary to have recourse
to symbols, for words are only and truly certain arbitrary symbols by
which and through which we give an utterance to our ideas. The
construction of language was, therefore, one of the first products of
the science of symbolism.

We must constantly bear in mind this fact, of the primary existence and
predominance of symbolism in the earliest times. [41](sof37.htm#xref_41.md)
when we are investigating the nature of the ancient religions, with
which the history of Freemasonry is so intimately connected. The older
the religion, the more the symbolism abounds. Modern religions may
convey their dogmas in abstract propositions; ancient religions always
conveyed them in symbols. Thus there is more symbolism in the Egyptian
religion than in the Jewish, more in the Jewish than in the Christian,
more in the Christian than in the Mohammedan, and, lastly, more in the
Roman than in the Protestant.

But symbolism is not only the most ancient and general, but it is also
the most practically useful, of sciences. We have already seen how
actively it operates in the early stages of life and of society. We have
seen how the first ideas of men and of nations are impressed upon their
minds by means of symbols. It was thus that the ancient peoples were
almost wholly educated.

"In the simpler stages of society," says one writer on this subject,
"mankind can be instructed in the abstract knowledge of truths only by
symbols and parables. Hence we find most heathen religions becoming
mythic, or explaining their mysteries by allegories, or instructive
incidents. Nay, God himself, knowing the nature of the creatures formed
by him, has condescended, in the earlier revelations that he made of
himself, to teach by symbols; and the greatest of all teachers
instructed the multitudes by parables. [42](sof37.htm#xref_42.md) The great
exemplar of the ancient philosophy and the grand archetype of modern
philosophy were alike distinguished by their possessing this faculty in
a high degree, and have told us that man was best instructed by
similitudes."  [43](sof37.htm#xref_43.md)

Such is the system adopted in Freemasonry for the development and
inculcation of the great religious and philosophical truths, of which it
was, for so many years, the sole conservator. And it is for this reason
that I have already remarked, that any inquiry into the symbolic
character of Freemasonry, must be preceded by an investigation of the
nature of symbolism in general, if we would properly appreciate its
particular use in the organization of the masonic institution.
