------------------------------------------------------------------------

### N

NAME. All Hebrew names are significant, and were originally imposed with
reference to some fact or feature in the history or character of the
persons receiving them. Camden says that the same custom prevailed among
all the nations of antiquity. So important has this subject been
considered, that "Onomastica," or treatises on the signification of
names have been written by Eusebius and St. Jerome, by Simonis and
Hillerus, and by several other scholars, of whom Eusebe Salverte is the
most recent and the most satisfactory. Shuckford (Connect. ii. 377) says
that the Jewish Rabbins thought that the true knowledge of names was a
science preferable to the study of the written law.

NAME OF GOD. The true pronunciation, and consequently the signification,
of the name of God can only be obtained through a cabalistical
interpretation.

It is a symbol of divine truth. None but those who are familiar with the
subject can have any notion of the importance bestowed on this symbol by
the Orientalists. The Arabians have a science called *Ism Allah*, or the
*science of the name of God*; and the Talmudists and Rabbins have
written copiously on the same subject. The Mussulmans, says Salverte
(Essai sur les Noms, ii. 7), have one hundred names of God, which they
repeat while counting the beads of a rosary.

NEOPHYTE. (From the Greek νέον and φυιὸν, *a new plant*.) One who has
been recently initiated in the Mysteries. St. Paul uses the same word (I
Tim. iii. 6) to denote one who had been recently converted to the
Christian faith.

NOACHIDAE. The descendants of Noah, and the transmitters of his
religious dogmas, which were the unity of God and the immortality of the
soul. The name has from the earliest times been bestowed upon the
Freemasons, who teach the same doctrines. Thus in the "old charges," as
quoted by Anderson (Const. edit. 1738, p. 143), it is said, "A mason is
obliged by his tenure to observe the moral law as a true Noachidae."

NOACHITES. The same as *Noachidae*, which see.

NORTH. That part of the earth which, being most removed from the
influence of the sun at his meridian height, is in Freemasonry called "a
place of darkness." Hence it is a symbol of the profane world.

NORTH-EAST CORNER. An important ceremony of the first degree, which
refers to the north-east corner of the lodge, is explained by the
symbolism of the corner-stone.

The corner-stone of a building is always laid in the north-east corner,
for symbolic reasons.

The north-east point of the heavens was especially sacred among the
Hindoos.

In the symbolism of Freemasonry, the north refers to the outer or
profane world, and the east to the inner world of Masonry; and hence the
north-east is symbolic of the double position of the neophyte, partly in
the darkness of the former, partly in the light of the latter.

NUMBERS. The symbolism of sacred numbers, which prevails very
extensively in Freemasonry, was undoubtedly borrowed from the school of
Pythagoras; but it is just as likely that he got it from Egypt or
Babylon, or from both. The Pythagorean doctrine was, according to
Aristotle (Met. xii. 8), that all things proceed from numbers. M.
Dacier, however, in his life of the philosopher, denies that the
doctrine of numbers was taught by Pythagoras himself, but attributes it
to his later disciples. But his arguments are not conclusive or
satisfactory.

### O

OATH OF SECRECY. It was always administered to the candidate in the
ancient Mysteries.

ODD NUMBERS. In the system of Pythagoras, odd numbers were symbols of
perfection. Hence the sacred numbers of Freemasonry are all odd. They
are 3, 5, 7, 9, 15, 27, 33, and 81.

OIL. An element of masonic consecration, and, as a symbol of prosperity
and happiness, is intended, under the name of the "oil of joy," to
indicate the expected propitious results of the consecration of any
thing or person to a sacred purpose.

OLIVE. In a secondary sense, the symbol of peace and of victory; but in
its primary meaning, like all the other Sacred plants of antiquity, a
symbol of immortality; and thus in the Mysteries it was the analogue of
the acacia of the Freemasons.

OLIVER. The Rev. George Oliver, D.D., of Lincolnshire, England, who died
in 1868, is by far the most distinguished and the most voluminous of the
English writers on Freemasonry. Looking to his vast labors and
researches in the arcana of the science, no student of masonry can speak
of his name or his memory without profound reverence for his learning,
and deep gratitude for the services that he has accomplished. To the
author of this work the recollection will ever be most grateful that he
enjoyed the friendship of so good and so great a man; one of whom we may
testify, as Johnson said of Goldsmith, that "nihil quod tetigit non
ornavit." In his writings he has traversed the whole field of masonic
literature and science, and has treated, always with great ability and
wonderful research, of its history, its antiquities, its rites and
ceremonies, its ethics, and its symbols. Of all his works, his
"Historical Landmarks," in two volumes, is the most important, the most
useful, and the one which will perhaps the longest perpetuate his
memory. In the study of his works, the student must be careful not to
follow too implicitly all his conclusions. These were in his own mind
controlled by the theory which he had adopted, and which he continuously
maintained, that Freemasonry was a Christian institution, and that the
connection between it and the Christian religion was absolute and
incontrovertible. He followed in the footsteps of Hutchinson, but with a
far more expanded view of the masonic system.

OPERATIVE MASONRY. Masonry considered merely as a useful art, intended
for the protection and the convenience of man by the erection of
edifices which may supply his intellectual, religious, and physical
wants.

In contradistinction to Speculative Masonry, therefore, it is said to be
engaged in the construction of a material temple.

ORAL LAW. The oral law among the Jews was the commentary on and the
interpretation of the written contained in the Pentateuch; and the
tradition is, that it was delivered to Moses at the same time,
accompanied by the divine command, "Thou shalt not divulge the words
which I have said to thee out of my mouth." The oral law was, therefore,
never intrusted to books; but being preserved in the memories of the
judges, prophets, priests, and wise men, was handed down from one to the
other through a long succession of ages. But after the destruction of
Jerusalem by the Romans under Adrian, A.D. 135, and the final dispersion
of the Jews, fears being entertained that the oral law would be lost, it
was then committed to writing, and now constitutes the text of the
Talmud.

ORMUZD. Worshipped by the disciples of Zoroaster as the principle of
good, and symbolized by light. See *Ahriman*.

OSIRIS. The chief god of the ancient Egyptians, and worshipped as a
symbol of the sun, and more philosophically as the male or generative
principle. Isis, his wife, was the female or prolific principle; and
Horus, their child, was matter, or the world--the product of the two
principles.

OSIRIS, MYSTERIES OF. The Osirian Mysteries consisted in a scenic
representation of the murder of Osiris by Typhon, the subsequent
recovery of his mutilated body by Isis, and his deification, or
restoration to immortal life.

OVAL TEMPLES. Temples of an oval form were representations of the
mundane egg, a symbol of the world.

### P

PALM TREE. In its secondary sense the palm tree is a symbol of victory;
but in its primary signification it is a symbol of the victory over
death, that is, immortality.

PARABLE. A narrative in which one thing is compared with another. It is
in principle the same as a symbol or an allegory.

PARALLEL LINES. The lines touching the circle in the symbol of the point
within a circle. They are said to represent St. John the Baptist and St.
John the Evangelist; but they really refer to the solstitial points
Cancer and Capricorn, in the zodiac.

PASTOS. (From the Greek παστὸς, *a nuptial couch*.) The coffin or grave
which contained the body of the god or hero whose death was scenically
represented in the ancient Mysteries.

It is the analogue of the grave in the third degree of Masonry.

PELASGIAN RELIGION. The Pelasgians were the oldest if not the aboriginal
inhabitants of Greece. Their religion differed from that of the Hellenes
who succeeded them in being less poetical, less mythical, and more
abstract. We know little of their religious worship, except by
conjecture; but we may suppose it resembled in some respects the
doctrines of the Primitive Freemasonry. Creuzer thinks that the
Pelasgians were either a nation of priests or a nation ruled by priests.

PHALLUS. A representation of the virile member, which was venerated as a
religious symbol very universally, and without the slightest
lasciviousness, by the ancients. It was one of the modifications of sun
worship, and was a symbol of the fecundating power of that luminary. The
masonic point within a circle is undoubtedly of phallic origin.

PHILOSOPHY OF FREEMASONRY. The dogmas taught in the masonic system
constitute its philosophy. These consist in the contemplation of God as
one and eternal, and of man as immortal. In other words, the philosophy
of Freemasonry inculcates the unity of God and the immortality of the
soul.

PLUMB. One of the working tools of a Fellow Craft, and a symbol of
rectitude of conduct.

POINT WITHIN A CIRCLE. It is derived from the ancient sun worship, and
is in reality of phallic origin. It is a symbol of the universe, the sun
being represented by the point, while the circumference is the universe.

PORCH OF THE TEMPLE. A symbol of the entrance into life.

PRIMITIVE FREEMASONRY. The Primitive Freemasonry of the antediluvians is
a term for which we are indebted to Oliver, although the theory was
broached by earlier writers, and among them by the Chevalier Ramsay. The
theory is, that the principles and doctrines of Freemasonry existed in
the earliest ages of the world, and were believed and practised by a
primitive people, or priesthood, under the name of Pure or Primitive
Freemasonry. That this Freemasonry, that is to say, the religious
doctrine inculcated by it, was, after the flood, corrupted by the pagan
philosophers and priests, and, receiving the title of *Spurious
Freemasory*, was exhibited in the ancient Mysteries. The Noachidae,
however, preserved the principles of the Primitive Freemasonry, and
transmitted them to succeeding ages, when at length they assumed the
name of *Speculative Masonry*. The Primitive Freemasonry was probably
without ritual or symbolism, and consisted only of a series of abstract
propositions derived from antediluvian traditions. Its dogmas were the
unity of God and the immortality of the soul.

PROFANE. One who has not been initiated as a Freemason. In the technical
language of the Order, all who are not Freemasons are profanes. The term
is derived from the Latin words *pro fano*, which literally signify "in
front of the temple," because those in the ancient religions who were
not initiated in the sacred rites or Mysteries of any deity were not
permitted to enter the temple, but were compelled to remain outside, or
in front of it. They were kept on the outside. The expression a
*profane* is not recognized as a noun substantive in the general usage
of the language; but it has been adopted as a technical term in the
dialect of Freemasonry, in the same relative sense in which the word
*layman* is used in the professions of law and divinity.

PURE FREEMASONRY OF ANTIQUITY. The same as Primitive Freemasonry,--which
see.

PURIFICATION. A religious rite practised by the ancients, and which was
performed before any act of devotion. It consisted in washing the hands,
and sometimes the whole body, in lustral or consecrated water. It was
intended as a symbol of the internal purification of the heart. It was a
ceremony preparatory to initiation in all the ancient Mysteries.

PYTHAGORAS. A Grecian philosopher, supposed to have been born in the
island of Samos, about 584 B.C. He travelled extensively for the purpose
of acquiring knowledge. In Egypt he was initiated in the Mysteries of
that country by the priests. He also repaired to Babylon, where he
became acquainted with the mystical learning of the Chaldeans, and had,
no doubt, much communication with the Israelitish captives who had been
exiled from Jerusalem, and were then dwelling in Babylon. On his return
to Europe he established a school, which in its organization, as well as
its doctrines, bore considerable resemblance to Speculative Masonry; for
which reason he has been claimed as "an ancient friend and brother" by
the modern Freemasons.

### R

RESURRECTION. This doctrine was taught in the ancient Mysteries, as it
is in Freemasonry, by a scenic representation. The initiation was death,
the autopsy was resurrection. Freemasonry does not interest itself with
the precise mode of the resurrection, or whether the body buried and the
body raised are in all their parts identical. Satisfied with the general
teaching of St. Paul, concerning the resurrection that "it is sown a
natural body, it is raised a spiritual body," Freemasonry inculcates by
its doctrine of the resurrection the simple fact of a progressive
advancement from a lower to a higher sphere, and the raising of the soul
from the bondage of death to its inheritance of eternal life.

RITUAL. The forms and ceremonies used in conferring the degrees, or in
conducting the labors, of a lodge are called the ritual. There are many
rites of Freemasonry, which differ from each other in the number and
division of the degrees, and in their rituals, or forms and ceremonies.
But the great principles of Freemasonry, its philosophy and its
symbolism, are alike in all. It is evident, then, that in an
investigation of the symbolism of Freemasonry, we have no concern with
its ritual, which is but an outer covering that is intended to conceal
the treasure that is within.

ROSICRUCIANS. A sect of hermetical philosophers, founded in the
fifteenth century, who were engaged in the study of abstruse sciences.
It was a secret society much resembling the masonic in its organization,
and in some of the subjects of its investigation; but it was in no other
way connected with Freemasonry. It is, however, well worth the study of
the masonic student on account of the light that it throws upon many of
the masonic symbols.

ROYAL ART. Freemasonry is so called because it is supposed to have been
founded by two kings,--the kings of Israel and Tyre,--and because it has
been subsequently encouraged and patronized by monarchs in all
countries.

### S

SABIANISM, or SABAISM. The worship of the sun, moon, and stars, the צבא
השמים TSABA *Hashmaim*, "the host of heaven." It was practised in
Persia, Chaldea, India, and other Oriental countries, at an early period
of the world's history. Sun-worship has had a powerful influence on
subsequent and more rational religions, and relics of it are to be found
even in the symbolism of Freemasonry.

SACELLUM. A sacred place consecrated to a god, and containing an altar.

SAINTE CROIX. The work of the Baron de Sainte Croix, in two volumes,
entitled, "Recherches Historiques et Critiques sur les Mystères du
Paganisme," is one of the most valuable and instructive works that we
have in any language on the ancient Mysteries,--those religious
associations whose history and design so closely connect them with
Freemasonry. To the student of masonic philosophy and symbolism this
work of Sainte Croix is absolutely essential.

SALSETTE. An island in the Bay of Bombay, celebrated for stupendous
caverns excavated artificially out of the solid rock, and which were
appropriated to the initiations in the ancient Mysteries of India.

SENSES, FIVE HUMAN. A symbol of intellectual cultivation.

SETH. It is the masonic theory that the principles of the Pure or
Primitive Freemasonry were preserved in the race of Seth, which had
always kept separate from that of Cain, but that after the flood they
became corrupted, by a secession of a portion of the Sethites, who
established the Spurious Freemasonry of the Gentiles.

SEVEN. A sacred number among the Jews and the Gentiles, and called by
Pythagoras a "venerable number."

SHEM HAMPHORASH. (שם המפירש *the declaratory name*.) The tetragrammaton
is so called, because, of all the names of God, it alone distinctly
declares his nature and essence as self-existent and eternal.

SHOE. See *Investiture, Rite of*.

SIGNS. There is abundant evidence that they were used in the ancient
Mysteries. They are valuable only as modes of recognition. But while
they are absolutely conventional, they have, undoubtedly, in
Freemasonry, a symbolic reference.

SIVA. One of the manifestations of the supreme deity of the Hindoos, and
a symbol of the sun in its meridian.

SONS OF LIGHT. Freemasons are so called because *Lux*, or *Light*, is
one of the names of Speculative Masonry.

SOLOMON. The king of Israel, and the founder of the temple of Jerusalem
and of the temple organization of Freemasonry.

That his mind was eminently symbolic in its propensities, is evident
from all the writings that are attributed to him.

SPECULATIVE MASONRY. Freemasonry considered as a science which
speculates on the character of God and man, and is engaged in
philosophical investigations of the soul and a future existence, for
which purpose it uses the terms of an operative art.

It is engaged symbolically in the construction of a spiritual temple.

There is in it always a progress--an advancement from a lower to a
higher sphere.

SPIRITUAL TEMPLE. The body of man; that temple alluded to by Christ and
St. Paul; the temple, in the construction of which the Speculative Mason
is engaged, in contradistinction to that material temple which occupies
the labors of the Operative Mason.

SPURIOUS FREEMASONRY OF ANTIQUITY. A term applied to the initiations in
the Mysteries of the ancient pagan world, and to the doctrines taught in
those Mysteries. See *Mysteries*.

SQUARE. A geometric figure consisting of four equal sides and equal
angles. In Freemasonry it is a symbol of morality, or the strict
performance of every duty. The Greeks deemed it a figure of perfection,
and the "square man" was a man of unsullied integrity.

SQUARE, TRYING. One of the working-tools of a Fellow Craft, and a symbol
of morality.

STONE OF FOUNDATION. A very important symbol in the masonic system. It
is like the *word*, the symbol of divine truth.

STONE WORSHIP. A very early form of fetichism. The Pelasgians are
supposed to have given to their statues of the gods the general form of
cubical stones, whence in Hellenic times came the Hermae, or images of
Hermes.

SUBSTITUTE WORD. A symbol of the unsuccessful search after divine truth,
and the discovery in this life of only an approximation to it.

SUN, RISING. In the Sabian worship the rising sun was adored on its
resurrection from the apparent death of its evening setting. Hence, in
the ancient Mysteries, the rising sun was a symbol of the regeneration
of the soul.

SUN-WORSHIP. The most ancient of all superstitions. It prevailed
especially in Phoenicia, Chaldea. and Egypt, and traces of it have been
discovered in Peru and Mexico. Its influence was felt in the ancient
Mysteries, and abundant allusions to it are to be found in the symbolism
of Freemasonry.

SWEDENBORG. A Swedish philosopher, and the founder of a religious sect.
Clavel, Ragon, and some other writers have sought to make him the
founder of a masonic rite also, but without authority. In 1767
Chastanier established the rite of Illuminated Theosophists, whose
instructions are derived from the writings of Swedenborg, but the sage
himself had nothing to do with it. Yet it cannot be denied that the mind
of Swedenborg was eminently symbolic in character, and that the masonic
student may derive many valuable ideas from portions of his numerous
works, especially from his "Celestial Arcana" and his "Apocalypse
Revealed."

SYMBOL. A visible sign with which a spiritual feeling, emotion, or idea
is connected.--*Müller*. Every natural thing which is made the sign or
representation of a moral idea is a symbol.

SYMBOL, COMPOUND. A species of symbol not unusual in Freemasonry, where
the symbol is to be taken in a double sense, meaning in its general
application one thing, and then in a special application another.

SYMBOLISM, SCIENCE OF. To what has been said in the text, may be added
the following apposite remarks of Squier: "In the absence of a written
language or forms of expression capable of conveying abstract ideas, we
can readily comprehend the necessity, among a primitive people, of a
symbolic system. That symbolism in a great degree resulted from this
necessity, is very obvious; and that, associated with man's primitive
religious systems, it was afterwards continued, when in the advanced
stage of the human mind, the previous necessity no longer existed, is
equally undoubted. It thus came to constitute a kind of sacred language,
and became invested with an esoteric significance understood only by the
few."--*The Serpent Symbol in America*, p. 19.

### T

TABERNACLE. Erected by Moses in the wilderness as a temporary place for
divine worship. It was the antitype of the temple of Jerusalem, and,
like it, was a symbol of the universe.

TALISMAN. A figure either carved in metal or stone, or delineated on
parchment or paper, made with superstitious ceremonies under what was
supposed to be the special influence of the planetary bodies, and
believed to possess occult powers of protecting the maker or possessor
from danger. The figure in the text is a talisman, and among the
Orientals no talisman was more sacred than this one where the nine
digits are so disposed as to make 15 each way. The Arabians called it
*zahal*, which was the name of the planet Saturn, because the nine
digits added together make 45, and the letters of the word *zahal* are,
according to the numerical powers of the Arabic alphabet, equivalent to
45. The cabalists esteem it because 15 was the numerical power of the
letters composing the word JAH, which is one of the names of God.

TALMUD. The mystical philosophy of the Jewish Rabbins is contained in
the Talmud, which is a collection of books divided into two parts, the
*Mishna*, which contains the record of the oral law, first committed to
writing in the second or third century, and the *Gemara*, or
commentaries on it. In the Talmud much will be found of great interest
to the masonic student.

TEMPLE. The importance of the temple in the symbolism of Freemasonry
will authorize the following citation from the learned Montfaucon
(*Ant.* ii. 1. ii. ch. ii.): "Concerning the origin of *temples*, there
is a variety of opinions. According to Herodotus, the Egyptians were the
first that made altars, statues, and temples. It does not, however,
appear that there were any in Egypt in the time of Moses, for he never
mentions them, although he had many opportunities for doing so. Lucian
says that the Egyptians were the first people who built temples, and
that the Assyrians derived the custom from them, all of which is,
however, very uncertain. The first allusion to the subject in Scripture
is the Tabernacle, which was, in fact, a portable temple, and contained
one place within it more holy and secret than the others, called the
*Holy of Holies*, and to which the *adytum* in the pagan temples
corresponded. The first heathen temple mentioned in Scripture is that of
Dagon, the god of the Philistines. The Greeks, who were indebted to the
Phoenicians for many things, may be supposed to have learned from them
the art of building temples; and it is certain that the Romans borrowed
from the Greeks both the worship of the gods and the construction of
temples."

TEMPLE BUILDER. The title by which Hiram Abif is sometimes designated.

TEMPLE OF SOLOMON. The building erected by King Solomon on Mount Moriah,
in Jerusalem, has been often called "the cradle of Freemasonry," because
it was there that that union took place between the operative and
speculative masons, which continued for centuries afterwards to present
the true organization of the masonic system.

As to the size of the temple, the dimensions given in the text may be
considered as accurate so far as they agree with the description given
in the First Book of Kings. Josephus gives a larger measure, and makes
the length 105 feet, the breadth 35 feet, and the height 210 feet; but
even these will not invalidate the statement in the text, that in size
it was surpassed by many a parish church.

TEMPLE SYMBOLISM. That symbolism which is derived from the temple of
Solomon. It is the most fertile of all kinds of symbolism in the
production of materials for the masonic science.

TERMINUS. One of the most ancient of the Roman deities. He was the god
of boundaries and landmarks, and his statue consisted only of a cubical
stone, without arms or legs, to show that he was immovable.

TETRACTYS. A figure used by Pythagoras, consisting of ten points,
arranged in a triangular form so as to represent the monad, duad, triad,
and quarterniad. It was considered as very sacred by the Pythagoreans,
and was to them what the tetragrammaton was to the Jews.

TETRAGRAMMATON. (From the Greek τετρὰς, *four*, and γρὰμμα, a letter).
The four-lettered name of God in the Hebrew language, which consisted of
four letters, viz. יהוה commonly, but incorrectly, pronounced *Jehovah*.
As a symbol it greatly pervaded the rites of antiquity, and was perhaps
the earliest symbol corrupted by the Spurious Freemasonry of the pagan
Mysteries.

It was held by the Jews in profound veneration, and its origin supposed
to have been by divine revelation at the burning bush.

The word was never pronounced, but wherever met with *Adonai* was
substituted for it, which custom was derived from the perverted reading
of a, passage in the Pentateuch. The true pronunciation consequently was
utterly lost; this is explained by the want of vowels in the Hebrew
alphabet, so that the true vocalization of a word cannot be learned from
the letters of which it is composed.

The true pronunciation was intrusted to the high priest; but lest the
knowledge of it should be lost by his sudden death, it was also
communicated to his assistant; it was known also, probably, to the kings
of Israel.

The Cabalists and Talmudists enveloped it in a host of superstitions.

It was also used by the Essenes in their sacred rites, and by the
Egyptians as a pass-word.

Cabalistically read and pronounced, it means the male and female
principle of nature, the generative and prolific energy of creation.

THAMMUZ. A Syrian god, who was worshipped by those women of the Hebrews
who had fallen into idolatry. The idol was the same as the Phoenician
Adonis, and the Mysteries of the two were identical.

TRAVELLING FREEMASONS. See *Freemasons, Travelling*.

TRESTLE BOARD. The board or tablet on which the designs of the architect
are inscribed. It is a symbol of the moral law as set forth in the
revealed will of God.

Every man must have his trestle board, because it is the duty of every
man to work out the task which God, the chief Architect, has assigned to
him.

TRIANGLE. A symbol of Deity.

This symbolism is found in many of the ancient religions.

Among the Egyptians it was a symbol of universal nature, or of the
protection of the world by the male and female energies of creation.

TRIANGLE, RADIATED. A triangle placed within a circle of rays. In
Christian art it is a symbol of God; then the rays are called a *glory*.
When they surround the triangle in the form of a circle, the triangle is
a symbol of the glory of God. When the rays emanate from the centre of
the triangle, it is a symbol of divine light. This is the true form of
the masonic radiated triangle.

TRILITERAL NAME. This is the word AUM, which is the ineffable name of
God among the Hindoos, and symbolizes the three manifestations of the
Brahminical supreme god, Brahma, Siva, and Vishnu. It was never to be
pronounced aloud, and was analogous to the sacred tetragrammaton of the
Jews.

TROWEL. One of the working tools of a Master Mason. It is a symbol of
brotherly love.

TRUTH. It was not always taught publicly by the ancient philosophers to
the people.

The search for it is the object of Freemasonry. It is never found on
earth, but a substitute for it is provided.

TUAPHOLL. A term used by the Druids to designate an unhallowed
circumambulation around the sacred cairn, or altar, the movement being
against the sun, that is, from west to east by the north, the cairn
being on the left hand of the circumambulator.

TUBAL CAIN. Of the various etymologies of this name, only one is given
in the text; but most of the others in some way identify him with
Vulcan. Wellsford (*Mithridates Minor* p. 4) gives a singular etymology,
deriving the name of the Hebrew patriarch from the definite article ה
converted into ת, or *T* and *Baal*, "Lord," with the Arabic *kayn*, "a
blacksmith," so that the word would then signify "the lord of the
blacksmiths." Masonic writers have, however, generally adopted the more
usual derivation of *Cain*, from a word signifying *possession*; and
Oliver descants on Tubal Cain as a symbol of worldly possessions. As to
the identity of Vulcan with Tubal Cain, we may learn something from the
definition of the offices of the former, as given by Diodorus Siculus:
"Vulcan was the first founder of works in iron, brass, gold, silver, and
all fusible metals; and he taught the uses to which fire can be applied
in the arts." See Genesis: "Tubal Cain, an instructor of every artificer
in brass and iron."

TWENTY-FOUR INCH GAUGE. A two-foot rule. One of the working-tools of an
Entered Apprentice, and a symbol of time well employed.

TYPHON. The brother and slayer of Osiris in the Egyptian mythology. As
Osiris was a type or symbol of the sun, Typhon was the symbol of winter,
when the vigor, heat, and, as it were, life of the sun are destroyed,
and of darkness as opposed to light.

TYRE. A city of Phoenicia, the residence of King Hiram, the friend and
ally of Solomon, whom he supplied with men and materials for the
construction of the temple.

TYRIAN FREEMASONS. These were the members of the Society of Dionysiac
Artificers, who at the time of the building of Solomon's temple
flourished at Tyre. Many of them were sent to Jerusalem by Hiram, King
of Tyre, to assist King Solomon in the construction of his temple.
There, uniting with the Jews, who had only a knowledge of the
speculative principles of Freemasonry, which had been transmitted to
them from Noah, through the patriarchs, the Tyrian Freemasons organized
that combined system of Operative and Speculative Masonry which
continued for many centuries, until the beginning of the eighteenth, to
characterize the institution. See *Dionysiac Artificers*.

### U

UNION. The union of the operative with the speculative element of
Freemasonry took place at the building of King Solomon's temple.

UNITY OF GOD. This, as distinguished from the pagan doctrine of
polytheism, or a multitude of gods, is one of the two religious truths
taught in Speculative Masonry, the other being the immortality of the
soul.

### W

WEARY SOJOURNERS. The legend of the "three weary sojourners" in the
Royal Arch degree is undoubtedly a philosophical myth, symbolizing the
search after truth.

WHITE. A symbol of innocence and purity.

Among the Pythagoreans it was a symbol of the good principle in nature,
equivalent to light.

WIDOW'S SON. An epithet bestowed upon the chief architect of the temple,
because he was "a widow's son of the tribe of Naphthali." 1 Kings vii.
14.

WINDING STAIRS, LEGEND OF. A legend in the Fellow Craft's degree having
no historical truth, but being simply a philosophical myth or legendary
symbol intended to communicate a masonic dogma.

It is the symbol of an ascent from a lower to a higher sphere.

It commences at the porch of the temple, which is a symbol of the
entrance into life.

The number of steps are always odd, because odd numbers are a symbol of
perfection.

But the fifteen steps in the American system are a symbol of the name of
God, *Jah*.

WINE. An element of masonic consecration, and, as a symbol of the inward
refreshment of a good conscience, is intended under the name of the
"wine of refreshment," to remind us of the eternal refreshments which
the good are to receive in the future life for the faithful performance
of duty in the present.

WORD. In Freemasonry this is a technical and symbolic term, and
signifies divine truth. The search after this word constitutes the whole
system of speculative masonry.

WORD, LOST. See *Lost Word*.

WORD, SUBSTITUTE. See *Substitute Word*.

WORK. In Freemasonry the initiation of a candidate is called *work*. It
is suggestive of the doctrine that labor is a masonic duty.

### Y

YGGDRASIL. The sacred ash tree in the Scandinavian Mysteries. Dr. Oliver
propounds the theory that it is the analogue of the theological ladder
in the Masonic Mysteries. But it is doubtful whether this theory is
tenable.

YOD. A Hebrew letter, in form thus י, and about equivalent to the
English I or Y. It is the initial letter of the tetragrammaton, and is
often used, especially enclosed within a triangle, as a substitute for,
or an abridgement of, that sacred word.

It is a symbol of the life-giving and sustaining power of God.

YONI. Among the nations and religions of India the yoni was the
representation of the female organ of generation, and was the symbol of
the prolific power of nature. It is the same as the *cteis* among the
Occidental nations.

### Z

ZENNAAR. The sacred girdle of the Hindoos. It is supposed to be the
analogue of the masonic apron.

ZOROASTER. A distinguished philosopher and reformer, whose doctrines
were professed by the ancient Persians. The religion of Zoroaster was a
dualism, in which the two antagonizing principles were Ormuzd and
Abriman, symbols of Light and Darkness. It was a modification and
purification of the old fire-worship, in which the fire became a symbol
of the sun, so that it was really a species of sun-worship. Mithras,
representing the sun, becomes the mediator between Ormuzd, or the
principle of Darkness, and the world.
