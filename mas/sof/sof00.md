## To General John C. Fremont.

My Dear Sir:

While any American might be proud of associating his name with that of
one who has done so much to increase the renown of his country, and to
enlarge the sum of human knowledge, this book is dedicated to you as a
slight testimonial of regard for your personal character, and in
grateful recollection of acts of friendship.

Yours very truly,

A. G. Mackey.
