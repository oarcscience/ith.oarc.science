## VII.

### The Union of Speculative and Operative Masonry at the Temple of Solomon.

Thus, then, we arrive at another important epoch in the history of the
origin of Freemasonry.

I have shown how the Primitive Freemasonry, originating in this new
world; with Noah, was handed down to his descendants as a purely
speculative institution, embracing certain traditions of the nature of
God and of the soul.

I have shown how, soon after the deluge, the descendants of Noah
separated, one portion, losing their traditions, and substituting in
their place idolatrous and polytheistic religions, while the other and
smaller portion retained and communicated those original traditions
under the name of the Primitive Freemasonry of antiquity.

I have shown how, among the polytheistic nations, there were a few
persons who still had a dim and clouded understanding of these
traditions, and that they taught them in certain secret institutions,
known as the "Mysteries," thus establishing another branch of the
speculative science which is known under the name of the Spurious
Freemasonry of antiquity.

Again, I have shown how one sect or division of these Spurious
Freemasons existed at Tyre about the time of the building of King
Solomon's temple, and added to their speculative science, which was much
purer than that of their contemporary Gentile mystics, the practice of
the arts of architecture and sculpture, under the name of the Dionysiac
Fraternity of Artificers.

And, lastly, I have shown how, at the building of the Solomonic temple,
on the invitation of the king of Israel, a large body of these
architects repaired from Tyre to Jerusalem, organized a new institution,
or, rather, a modification of the two old ones, the Primitive Freemasons
among the Israelites yielding something, and the Spurious Freemasons
among the Tyrians yielding more; the former purifying the speculative
science, and the latter introducing the operative art, together with the
mystical ceremonies with which they accompanied its administration.

It is at this epoch, then, that I place the first union of speculative
and operative Masonry,--a union which continued uninterruptedly to exist
until a comparatively recent period, to which I shall have occasion
hereafter briefly to advert.

The other branches of the Spurious Freemasonry were not, however,
altogether and at once abolished by this union, but continued also to
exist and teach their half-truthful dogmas, for ages after, with
interrupted success and diminished influence, until, in the fifth
century of the Christian era, the whole of them were proscribed by the
Emperor Theodosius. From time to time, however, other partial unions
took place, as in the instance of Pythagoras, who, originally a member
of the school of Spurious Freemasonry, was, during his visit to Babylon,
about four hundred and fifty years after the union at the temple of
Jerusalem, initiated by the captive Israelites into the rites of Temple
Masonry, whence the instructions of that sage approximate much more
nearly to the principles of Freemasonry, both in spirit and in letter,
than those of any other of the philosophers of antiquity; for which
reason he is familiarly called, in the modern masonic lectures, "an
ancient friend and brother," and an important symbol of the order, the
forty-seventh problem of Euclid, has been consecrated to his memory.

I do not now propose to enter upon so extensive a task as to trace the
history of the institution from the completion of the first temple to
its destruction by Nebuchadnezzar; through the seventy-two years of
Babylonish captivity to the rebuilding of the second temple by
Zerubbabel; thence to the devastation of Jerusalem by Titus, when it was
first introduced into Europe; through all its struggles in the middle
ages, sometimes protected and sometimes persecuted by the church,
sometimes forbidden by the law and oftener encouraged by the monarch;
until, in the beginning of the sixteenth century, it assumed its present
organization. The details would require more time for their
recapitulation than the limits of the present work will permit.

But my object is not so much to give a connected history of the progress
of Freemasonry as to present a rational view of its origin and an
examination of those important modifications which, from time to time,
were impressed upon it by external influences, so as to enable us the
more readily to appreciate the true character and design of its
symbolism.

Two salient points, at least, in its subsequent history, especially
invite attention, because they have an important bearing on its
organization, as a combined speculative and operative institution.
