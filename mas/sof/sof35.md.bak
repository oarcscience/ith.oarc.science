### F

FABER. The works of the Rev. G.S. Faber, on the Origin of Pagan
Idolatry, and on the Cabiri, are valuable contributions to the science
of mythology. They abound in matters of interest to the investigator of
masonic symbolism and philosophy, but should be read with a careful view
of the preconceived theory of the learned author, who refers everything
in the ancient religions to the influences of the Noachic cataclysm, and
the arkite worship which he supposes to have resulted from it.

FELLOW CRAFT. The second degree of Ancient Craft Masonry, analogous to
the mystes in the ancient Mysteries.

The symbol of a youth setting forth on the journey of life.

FETICHISM. The worship of uncouth and misshapen idols, practised only by
the most ignorant and debased peoples, and to be found at this day among
some of the least civilized of the negro tribes of Africa. "Their
fetiches," says Du Chaillu, speaking of some of the African races,
"consisted of fingers and tails of monkeys; of human hair, skin, teeth,
bones; of clay, old nails, copper chains; shells, feathers, claws, and
skulls of birds; pieces of iron, copper, or wood; seeds of plants, ashes
of various substances, and I cannot tell what more." *Equatorial
Africa*, p. 93.

FIFTEEN. A sacred number, symbolic of the name of God, because the
letters of the holy name יה, JAH, are equal, in the Hebrew mode of
numeration by the letters of the alphabet, to fifteen; for י is equal to
ten, and ה is equal to five. Hence, from veneration for this sacred
name, the Hebrews do not, in ordinary computations, when they wish to
express the number 15, make use of these two letters, but of two others,
which are equivalent to 9 and 6.

FORTY-SEVENTH PROBLEM. The forty-seventh problem of the first book of
Euclid is, that in any right-angled triangle the square which is
described upon the side subtending the right angle is equal to the
squares described upon the sides which contain the right angle. It is
said to have been discovered by Pythagoras while in Egypt, but was most
probably taught to him by the priests of that country, in whose rites he
had been initiated; it is a symbol of the production of the world by the
generative and prolific powers of the Creator; hence the Egyptians made
the perpendicular and base the representatives of Osiris and Isis, while
the hypothenuse represented their child Horus. Dr. Lardner says (*Com.
on Euclid*, p. 60) of this problem, "Whether we consider the
forty-seventh proposition with reference to the peculiar and beautiful
relation established by it, or to its innumerable uses in every
department of mathematical science, or to its fertility in the
consequences derivable from it, it must certainly be esteemed the most
celebrated and important in the whole of the elements, if not in the
whole range of mathematical science."

FOURTEEN. Some symbologists have referred the fourteen pieces into which
the mutilated body of Osiris was divided, and the fourteen days during
which the body of the builder was buried, to the fourteen days of the
disappearance of the moon. The Sabian worshippers of "the hosts of
heaven" were impressed with the alternate appearance and disappearance
of the moon, which at length became a symbol of death and resurrection.
Hence fourteen was a sacred number. As such it was viewed in the Osirian
Mysteries, and may have been introduced into Freemasonry with other
relics of the old worship of the sun and planets.

FREEMASONRY, DEFINITION OF. See *Definition*.

FREEMASONS, TRAVELLING. The travelling Freemasons were a society
existing in the middle ages, and consisting of learned men and prelates,
under whom were operative masons. The operative masons performed the
labors of the craft, and travelling from country to country, were
engaged in the construction of cathedrals, monasteries, and castles.
"There are few points in the history of the middle ages," says Godwin,
"more pleasing to look back upon than the existence of the associated
masons; they are the bright spot in the general darkness of that period;
the patch of verdure when all around is barren." *The Builder*, ix. 463

### G

G. The use of the letter G in the Fellow Craft's degree is an
anachronism. It is really a corruption of, or perhaps rather a
substitution for, the Hebrew letter י (yod), which is the initial of the
ineffable name. As such, it is a symbol of the life-giving and
life-sustaining power of God.

G.A.O.T.U. A masonic abbreviation used as a symbol of the name of God,
and signifying the *Grand Architect of the Universe*. It was adopted by
the Freemasons in accordance with a similar practice among all the
nations of antiquity of noting the Divine Name by a symbol.

GAVEL. What is called in Masonry a common gavel is a stone-cutter's
hammer; it is one of the working tools of an Entered Apprentice, and is
a symbol of the purification of the heart.

GLOVES. On the continent of Europe they are given to candidates at the
same time that they are invested with the apron; the same custom
formerly prevailed in England; but although the investiture of the
gloves is abandoned as a ceremony both there and in America, they are
worn as a part of masonic clothing.

They are a symbol of purification of life.

In the middle ages gloves were worn by operative masons.

GOD, UNITY OF. See *Unity of God*.

GOD, NAME OF. See *Name*.

GOLGOTHA. In Hebrew and Syriac it means *a skull*; a name of Mount
Calvary, and so called, probably, because it was the place of public
execution. The Latin *Calvaria*, whence Mount Calvary, means also a
skull.

GRAVE. In the Master's degree, a symbol which is the analogue of the
pastos, or couch, in the ancient Mysteries.

The symbolism has been Christianized by some masonic writers, and the
grave has thus been referred to the sepulchre of Christ.

GRIPS AND SIGNS. They are valuable only for social purposes as modes of
recognition.

### H

HAND. The hand is a symbol of human actions; pure hands symbolize pure
actions, and impure or unclean hands symbolize impure actions.

HARE. Among the Egyptians the hare was a hieroglyphic of *eyes that are
open*, and was the symbol of initiation into the Mysteries of Osiris.
The Hebrew word for *hare* is *arnabet*, and this is compounded of two
words that signify *to behold the light*. The connection of ideas is
apparent.

HELLENISM. The religion of the Helles, or ancient Greeks who immediately
succeeded the Pelasgians in the settlement of that country. It was, in
consequence of the introduction of the poetic element, more refined than
the old Pelasgic worship for which it was substituted. Its myths were
more philosophical and less gross than those of the religion to which it
succeeded.

HERMAE. Stones of a cubical form, which were originally unhewn, by which
the Greeks at first represented all their deities. They came in the
progress of time to be especially dedicated by the Greeks to the god
Hermes, whence the name, and by the Romans to the god Terminus, who
presided over landmarks.

HERO WORSHIP. The worship of men deified after death. It is a theory of
some, both ancient and modern writers, that all the pagan gods were once
human beings, and that the legends and traditions of mythology are mere
embellishments of the acts of these personages when alive. It was the
doctrine taught by Euhemerus among the ancients, and has been maintained
among the moderns by such distinguished authorities as Bochart, Bryant,
Voss, and Banier.

HERMETIC PHILOSOPHY. The system of the Alchemists, the Adepts, or
seekers of the philosopher's stone. No system has been more
misunderstood than this. It was secret, esoteric, and highly symbolical.
No one has so well revealed its true design as E.A. Hitchcock, who, in
his delightful work entitled "Remarks upon Alchemy and the Alchemists,"
says, "The genuine Alchemists were religious men, who passed their time
in legitimate pursuits, earning an honest subsistence, and in religious
contemplation, studying how to realize in themselves the union of the
divine and human nature, expressed in man by an enlightened submission
to God's will; and they thought out and published, after a manner of
their own, a method of attaining or entering upon this state, as the
only rest of the soul." There is a very great similarity between their
doctrines and those of the Freemasons; so much so that the two
associations have sometimes been confounded.

HIEROPHANT. (From the Greek ἱερὸς, *holy, sacred*, and φαίνω *to show*.)
One who instructs in sacred things; the explainer of the aporrheta, or
secret doctrines, to the initiates in the ancient Mysteries. He was the
presiding officer, and his rank and duties were analogous to those of
the master of a masonic lodge.

HIRAM ABIF. The architect of Solomon's temple. The word "Abif" signifies
in Hebrew "his father," and is used by the writer of Second Chronicles
(iv. 16) when he says, "These things did *Hiram his father* \[in the
original *Hiram Abif* \] do for King Solomon.".

The legend relating to him is of no value as a mere narrative, but of
vast importance in a symbolical point of view, as illustrating a great
philosophical and religious truth; namely, the dogma of the immortality
of the soul.

Hence, Hiram Abif is the symbol of man in the abstract sense, or human
nature, as developed in the life here and in the life to come.

HIRAM OF TYRE. The king of Tyre, the friend and ally of King Solomon,
whom he supplied with men and materials for building the temple. In the
recent, or what I am inclined to call the grand lecturer's symbolism of
Masonry (a sort of symbolism for which I have very little veneration),
Hiram of Tyre is styled the symbol of strength, as Hiram Abif is of
beauty. But I doubt the antiquity or authenticity of any such symbolism.
Hiram of Tyre can only be considered, historically, as being necessary
to complete the myth and symbolism of Hiram Abif. The king of Tyre is an
historical personage, and there is no necessity for transforming him
into a symbol, while his historical character lends credit and validity
to the philosophical myth of the third degree of Masonry.

HIRAM THE BUILDER. An epithet of Hiram Abif. For the full significance
of the term, see the word *Builder*.

HO-HI. A cabalistic pronunciation of the tetragrammaton, or ineffable
name of God; it is most probably the true one; and as it literally means
HE-SHE, it is supposed to denote the hermaphroditic essence of Jehovah,
as containing within himself the male and the female principle,--the
generative and the prolific energy of creation.

HO The sacred name of God among the Druids. Bryant supposes that by it
they intended the Great Father Noah; but it is very possible that it was
a modification of the Hebrew tetragrammaton, being the last syllable
read cabalistically (see *ho-hi*); if so, it signified the great male
principle of nature. But HU, in Hebrew הוא, is claimed by Talmudic
writers to be one of the names of God; and the passage in Isaiah xlii.
8, in the original *ani Jehovah, Hu shemi*, which is in the common
version "I am the LORD; that is my name," they interpret, "I am Jehovah;
my name is Hu."

HUTCHINSON, WILLIAM. A distinguished masonic writer of England, who
lived in the eighteenth century. He is the author of "The Spirit of
Masonry," published in 1775. This was the first English work of any
importance that sought to give a scientific interpretation of the
symbols of Freemasonry; it is, in fact, the earliest attempt of any kind
to treat Freemasonry as a science of symbolism. Hutchinson, however, has
to some extent impaired the value of his labors by contending that the
institution is exclusively Christian in its character and design.

### I

IH-HO. See *Ho-hi*.

IMMORTALITY OF THE SOUL. This is one of the two religious dogmas which
have always been taught in Speculative Masonry.

It was also taught in all the Rites and Mysteries of antiquity.

The doctrine was taught as an abstract proposition by the ancient
priesthood of the Pure or Primitive Freemasonry of antiquity, but was
conveyed to the mind of the initiate, and impressed upon him by a scenic
representation in the ancient Mysteries, or the Spurious Freemasonry of
the ancients.

INCOMMUNICABLE NAME. The tetragrammaton, so called because it was not
common to, and could not be bestowed upon, nor shared by, any other
being. It was proper to the true God alone. Thus Drusius
(Tetragrammaton, sive de Nomine Dei proprio, p. 108) says, "Nomen
quatuor literarum proprie et absolute non tribui nisi Deo vero. Unde
doctores catholici dicunt *incommunicabile* \[not common\] esse
creaturae."

INEFFABLE NAME. The tetragrammaton. So called because it is
*ineffabile*, or unpronounceable. See *Tetragrammaton*.

INTRUSTING, RITE OF. That part of the ceremony of initiation which
consists in communicating to the aspirant or candidate the aporrheta, or
secrets of the mystery.

INUNCTION. The act of anointing. This was a religious ceremony practised
from the earliest times. By the pouring on of oil, persons and things
were consecrated to sacred purposes.

INVESTITURE, RITE OF. That part of the ceremony of initiation which
consists of clothing the candidate masonically. It is a symbol of
purity.

ISH CHOTZEB. Hebrew איש הצב, *hewers of stones*. The Fellow Crafts at
the temple of Solomon. (2 Chron. ii. 2.).

ISH SABAL. Hebrew איש סבל, *bearers of burdens*. The Apprentices at the
temple of Solomon. (2 Chron. ii. 2.).

### J

JAH. It is in Hebrew יה whence Maimonides calls it "the two-lettered
name," and derives it from the tetragrammaton, of which it is an
abbreviation. Others have denied this, and assert that *Jah* is a name
independent of Jehovah, but expressing the same idea of the divine
essenee. See Gataker, *De Nom. Tetrag.*.

JEHOVAH. The incommunicable, ineffable name of God, in Hebrew יהוה, and
called, from the four letters of which it consists, the tetragrammaton,
or four-lettered name.

### L

LABOR. Since the article on the Symbolism of Labor was written, I have
met with an address delivered in 1868 by brother Troué, before St.
Peter's Lodge in Martinico, which contains sentiments on the relation of
Masonry to labor which are well worth a translation from the original
French. See *Bulletin du Grand Orient de France*, December, 1868.

"Our name of Mason, and our emblems, distinctly announce that our object
is the elevation of labor.

"We do not, as masons, consider labor as a punishment inflicted on man;
but on the contrary, we elevate it in our thought to the height of a
religious act, which is the most acceptable to God because it is the
most useful to man and to society.

"We decorate ourselves with the emblems of labor to affirm that our
doctrine is an incessant protest against the stigma branded on the law
of labor, and which an error of apprehension, proceeding from the
ignorance of men in primitive times has erected into a dogma; an error
that has resulted in the production of this anti-social phenomenon which
we meet with every day; namely, that the degradation of the workman is
the greater as his labor is more severe, and the elevation of the idler
is higher as his idleness is more complete. But the study of the laws
which maintain order in nature, released from the fetters of
preconceived ideas, has led the Freemasons to that doctrine, far more
moral than the contrary belief, that labor is not an expiation, but a
law of harmony, from the subjection to which man cannot be released
without impairing his own happiness, and deranging the order of
creation. The design of Freemasons is, then, the rehabilitation of
labor, which is indicated by the apron which we wear, and the gavel, the
trowel, and the level, which are found among our symbols."

Hence the doctrine of this work is, that Freemasonry teaches not only
the necessity, but the nobility, of labor.

And that labor is the proper worship due by man to God.

LADDER. A symbol of progressive advancement from a lower to a higher
sphere, which is common to Masonry, and to many, if not all, of the
ancient Mysteries.

LADDER, BRAHMINICAL. The symbolic ladder used in the Mysteries of
Brahma. It had seven steps, symbolic of the seven worlds of the Indian
universe.

LADDER, MITHRAITIC. The symbolic ladder used in the Persian Mysteries of
Mithras. It had seven steps, symbolic of the seven planets and the seven
metals.

LADDER, SCANDINAVIAN. The symbolic ladder used in the Gothic Mysteries.
Dr. Oliver refers it to the Yggrasil, or sacred ash tree. But the
symbolism is either very abstruse or very doubtful.

LADDER, THEOLOGICAL. The symbolic ladder of the masonic Mysteries. It
refers to the ladder seen by Jacob in his vision, and consists, like all
symbolical ladders, of seven rounds, alluding to the four cardinal and
the three theological virtues.

LAMB. A symbol of innocence. A very ancient symbol.

LAMB, PASCHAL. See *Paschal Lamb*.

LAMBSKIN APRON. See *Apron*.

LAW, ORAL. See *Oral Law*.

LEGEND. A narrative, whether true or false, that has been traditionally
preserved from the time of its first oral communication. Such is the
definition of a masonic legend. The authors of the
Conversations-Lexicon, referring to the monkish Lives of the Saints
which originated in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, say that the
title *legend* was given to all fictions which make pretensions to
truth. Such a remark, however correct it may be in reference to these
monkish narratives, which were often invented as ecclesiastical
exercises, is by no means applicable to the legends of Freemasonry.
These are not necessarily fictitious, but are either based on actual and
historical facts which have been but slightly modificd, or they are the
offspring and expansion of some symbolic idea in which latter respect
they differ entirely from the monastic legends, which often have only
the fertile imagination of some studious monk for the basis of their
construction.

LEGEND OF THE ROYAL ARCH DEGREE. Much of this legend is a mythical
history; but some portion of it is undoubtedly a philosophical myth. The
destruction and the reëdification of the temple, the captivity and the
return of the captives, are matters of history; but many of the details
have been invented and introduced for the purpose of giving form to a
symbolic idea.

LEGEND OF THE THIRD DEGREE. In all probability this legend is a mythical
history, in which truth is very largely and preponderatingly mixed with
fiction.

It is the most important and significant of the legendary symbols of
Freemasonry.

Has descended from age to age by oral tradition, and has been preserved
in every masonic rite.

No essential alteration of it has ever been made in any masonic system,
but the interpretations of it have been various; the most general one
is, that it is a symbol of the resurrection and the immortality of the
soul.

Some continental writers have supposed that it was a symbol of the
downfall of the Order of Templars, and its hoped-for restoration. In
some of the high philosophical degrees it is supposed to be a symbol of
the sufferings, death, and resurrection Christ. Hutchinson thought it a
symbol of the decadence of the Jewish religion, and the rise of the
Christian on its ruins. Oliver says that it symbolically refers to the
murder of Abel, the death of our race through Adam, and its restoration
through Christ.

Ragon thinks that it is a symbol of the sun shorn of its vigor by the
three winter months, and restored to generative power by the spring. And
lastly, Des Etangs says that it is a symbol of eternal reason, whose
enemies are the vices that deprave and finally destroy humanity.

But none of these interpretations, except the first, can be sustained.

LETTUCE. The sacred plant of the Mysteries of Adonis; a symbol of
immortality, and the analogue of the acacia.

LEVEL. One of the working tools of a Fellow Craft. It is a symbol of the
equality of station of all men before God.

LIBERAL ARTS AND SCIENCES. In the seventh century, all learning was
limited to the seven liberal arts and sciences; their introduction into
Freemasonry, referring to this theory, is a symbol of the completion of
human learning.

LIGHT. It denotes truth and knowledge, and is so explained in all the
ancient systems; in initiation, it is not material but intellectual
light that is sought.

It is predominant as a symbol in all the ancient initiations.

There it was revered because it was an emanation trom the sun, the
common object of worship; but the theory advanced by some writers, that
the veneration of light originally proceeded from its physical
qualities, is not correct.

Pythagoras called it the good principle in nature; and the Cabalists
taught that eternal light filled all space before the creation, and that
after creation it retired to a central spot, and became the instrument
of the Divine Mind in creating matter.

It is the symbol of the autopsy, or the full perfection and fruition of
initiation.

It is therefore a fundamental symbol in Freemasonry, and contains within
itself the very essence of the speculative science.

LINGAM. The phallus was so called by the Indian nations of the East. See
*Phallus*.

LODGE. The place where Freemasons meet, and also the congregation of
masons so met. The word is derived from the *lodges* occupied by the
travelling Freemasons of the middle ages.

It is a symbol of the world, or universe.

Its form, an oblong square, is symbolic of the supposed oblong form of
the world as known to the ancients.

LOST WORD. There is a masonic myth that there was a certain word which
was lost and afterwards recovered.

It is not material what the word was, nor how lost, nor when recovered:
the symbolism refers only to the abstract idea of a loss and a recovery.

It is a symbol of divine truth.

The search for it was also made by the philosophers and priests in the
Mysteries of the Spurious Freemasonry.

LOTUS. The sacred plant of the Brahminical Mysteries, and the analogue
of the acacia.

It was also a sacred plant among the Egyptians.

LUSTRATION. A purification by washing the hands or body in consecrated
water, practised in the ancient Mysteries. See *Purification*.

LUX (*light*). One of the appellations bestowed upon Freemasonry, to
indicate that it is that sublime doctrine of truth by which the pathway
of him who has attained it is to be illumined in the pilgrimage of life.
Among the Rosicrucians, light was the knowledge of the philosopher's
stone; and Mosheim says that in chemical language the cross was an
emblem of light, because it contains within its figure the forms of the
three figures of which LVX, or light, is composed.

LUX E TENEBRIS (*light out of darkness*). A motto of the Masonic Order,
which is equivalent to "truth out of initiation;" light being the symbol
of truth, and darkness the symbol of initiation commenced.

### M

MAN. Repeatedly referred to by Christ and the apostles as the symbol of
a temple.

MASTER MASON. The third degree of Ancient Craft Masonry, analogous to
the epopt of the ancient Mysteries.

MENATZCHIM. Hebrew מנצהים *superintendents*, or *overseers*. The Master
Masons at the temple of Solomon. (2 Chron. ii. 2.)

MENU. In the Indian mythology, Menu is the son of Brahma, and the
founder of the Hindoo religion. Thirteen other Menus are said to exist,
seven of whom have already reigned on earth. But it is the first one
whose instructions constitute the whole civil and religious polity of
the Hindoos. The code attributed to him by the Brahmins has been
translated by Sir William Jones, with the title of "The Institutes of
Menu."

MIDDLE CHAMBER. A part of the Solomonic temple, which was approached by
winding stairs, but which was certainly not appropriated to the purpose
indicated in the Fellow Craft's degree.

The legend of the Winding Stairs is therefore only a philosophical myth.

It is a symbol of this life and its labors.

MISTLETOE. The sacred plant of Druidism; commemorated also in the
Scandinavian rites. It is the analogue of the acacia, and like all the
other sacred plants of antiquity, is a symbol of the immortality of the
soul. Lest the language of the text should be misunderstood, it may be
remarked here that the Druidical and the Scandinavian rites are not
identical. The former are Celtic, the latter Gothic. But the fact that
in both the mistletoe was a sacred plant affords a violent presumption
that there must have been a common point from which both religions
started. There was, as I have said, an identity of origin for the same
ancient and general symbolic idea.

MITHRAS. He was the god worshipped by the ancient Persians, and
celebrated in their Mysteries as the symbol of the sun. In the
initiation in these Mysteries, the candidate passed through many
terrible trials, and his courage and fortitude were exposed to the most
rigorous tests. Among others, after ascending the mystical ladder of
seven steps, he passed through a scenic representation of Hades, or the
infernal regions; out of this and the surrounding darkness he was
admitted into the full light of Elysium, where he was obligated by an
oath of secrecy, and invested by the Archimagus, or High Priest, with
the secret instructions of the rite, among which was a knowledge of the
Ineffable Name.

MOUNT CALVARY. A small hill of Jerusalem, in a westerly direction, and
not far from Mount Moriah. In the legends of Freemasonry it is known as
"a small hill near Mount Moriah," and is referred to in the third
degree. This "small hill" having been determined as the burial-place of
Jesus, the symbol has been Christianized by many modern masons.

There are many masonic traditions, principally borrowed from the Talmud,
connected with Mount Calvary; such as, that it was the place where Adam
was buried, &c.

MOUNT MORIAH. The hill in Jerusalem on which the temple of Solomon was
built.

MYRTLE. The sacred plant in the Eleusinian Mysteries, and, as symbolic
of a resurrection and immortality, the analogue of the acacia.

MYSTERIES. A secret worship paid by the ancients to several of the pagan
gods, to which none were admitted but those who had been solemnly
initiated. The object of instruction in these Mysteries was, to teach
the unity of God and the immortality of the soul. They were divided into
Lesser and Greater Mysteries. The former were merely preparatory. In the
latter the whole knowledge was communicated. Speaking of the doctrine
that was communicated to the initiates, Philo Judaeus says that "it is
an incorruptible treasure, not like gold or silver, but more precious
than everything beside; for it is the knowledge of the Great Cause, and
of nature, and of that which is born of both." And his subsequent
language shows that there was a confraternity existing among the
initiates like that of the masonic institution; for he says, with his
peculiar mysticism, "If you meet an initiate, besiege him with your
prayers that he conceal from you no new mysteries that he may know; and
rest not until you have obtained them. For me, although I was initiated
into the Great Mysteries by Moses, the friend of God, yet, having seen
Jeremiah, I recognized him not only as an Initiate, but as a Hierophant;
and I followed his school." So, too, the mason acknowledges every
initiate as his brother, and is ever ready and anxious to receive all
the light that can be bestowed on the Mysteries in which he has been
indoctrinated.

MYSTES. (From the Greek μύω, *to shut the eyes*.) One who had been
initiated into the Lesser Mysteries of paganism. He was now blind, but
when he was initiated into the Greater Mysteries he was called an Epopt,
or one who saw.

MYTH. Grote's definition of the myth, which is cited in the text, may be
applied without modification to the myths of Freemasonry, although
intended by the author only for the myths of the ancient Greek religion.

The myth, then, is a narrative of remote date, not necessarily true or
false, but whose truth can only be certified by internal evidence. The
word was first applied to those fables of the pagan gods which have
descended from the remotest antiquity, and in all of which there
prevails a symbolic idea, not always, however, capable of a positive
interpretation. As applied to Freemasonry, the words *myth* and *legend*
are synonymous.

From this definition it will appear that the myth is really only the
interpretation of an idea. But how we are to read these myths will best
appear from these noble words of Max Müller: "Everything is true,
natural, significant, if we enter with a reverent spirit into the
meaning of ancient art and ancient language. Everything becomes false,
miraculous, and unmeaning, if we interpret the deep and mighty words of
the seers of old in the shallow and feeble sense of modern chroniclers."
(Science of Language, 2d Ser. p. 578.).

MYTH, HISTORICAL. An historical myth is a myth that has a known and
recognized foundation in historical truth, but with the admixture of a
preponderating amount of fiction in the introduction of personages and
circumstances. Between the historical myth and the mythical history, the
distinction as laid down in the text cannot always be preserved, because
we are not always able to determine whether there is a preponderance of
truth or of fiction in the legend or narrative under examination.

MYTHICAL HISTORY. A myth or legend in which the historical and truthful
greatly preponderate over the inventions of fiction.

MYTHOLOGY. Literally, the science of myths; and this is a very
appropriate definition, for mythology is the science which treats of the
religion of the ancient pagans, which was almost altogether founded on
myths, or popular traditions and legendary tales; and hence Keightly
(Mythol. of Ancient Greece and Italy, p. 2) says that "mythology may be
regarded as the repository of the early religion of the people." Its
interest to a masonic student arises from the constant antagonism that
existed between its doctrines and those of the Primitive Freemasonry of
antiquity and the light that the mythological Mysteries throw upon the
ancient organization of Speculative Masonry.

MYTH, PHILOSOPHICAL. This is a myth or legend that is almost wholly
unhistorical, and which has been invented only for the purpose of
enunciating and illustrating a particular thought or dogma.
