##### THE BANNERS.

There are two which belong to the Order of the Temple at this time. They
are the Grand Standard and the Beauceant.

The Grand Standard is of blue field, five by six feet, and made
tripartite at the bottom. Over the blood-red Passion Cross in the center
is the Motto of the Order, "*In Hoc Signo Vinces*." Beneath the Cross is
the ancient Templar motto, "*Non nobis Domine; non nobis, sed Nomini tuo
da Gloriam*."

The Beauceant is of the same form and dimensions as the Grand Standard.
The upper half of this Banner is black, and the lower half is white.

When the Templar looks upon the <span class="smallcaps">Grand
Standard</span> he is admonished to so live and serve the Master that
having passed through the portals of the grave he may receive from his
hand the Crown of Victory, while exclaiming, "<span
class="smallcaps">Not unto us, O Lord; not unto us, but unto thy Name be
the glory</span>."

<span class="smallcaps">The Beauceant</span>.—This was the Battle Flag
of the ancient Templars. It is half black and half white; signifying
that these Christian warriors were fair and favorable to the friends of
Christ, but dark and terrible to his enemies.

Sometimes this Banner was divided *per pale*, that is, perpendicularly,
but most frequently *per fesse*, that is, horizontally, the upper half
always black.

The red Passion Cross was sometimes on the white, but never on the
black. Color upon color would be false heraldry. The cry of the Templars
was, "Au Bausant for the Temple," but what that cry really meant is not
understood to-day.

The ancient Templars frequently painted the Beauceant upon their
kite-shaped shields, as an armorial bearing. It was said to betoken
Innocence, Death and Martyrdom.
