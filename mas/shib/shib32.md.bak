<span id="page_78">p. 78</span> <span id="page_79">p. 79</span>

### DEDICATION AND CONSECRATION OF ASYLUMS.

<span class="smallcaps">The</span> Triangle has twelve Tapers properly
displayed upon it. No other equipments thereon.

The Commandery is opened, and the Grand Commander and Staff received
according to the Tactics of the Jurisdiction.

EC.—Right Eminent Grand Commander, the members of — Commandery, No. —,
animated by zeal for the Order and veneration for the ceremonies
thereof, have prepared and furnished this Asylum, and now crave that you
dedicate and consecrate the same to the solemn rites of the Order of the
Temple.

GC.—Eminent Sir, I congratulate — Commandery on the appearance of the
Asylum which their liberality and good taste have prepared for the
observance of the ceremonies of the Order. It receives our entire
approbation, and at your request we will proceed to Consecrate the same
to the solemn uses for which it is intended.

GCG.—Sir Knights, <span class="smallcaps">Attention! Uncover!</span>

GC.—Excellent Grand Prelate, lead us in the Prayer of Dedication.

<span class="small">PRAYER.</span>

<span class="smallcaps">Almighty</span> and Most Merciful Father, look
upon us, Thy children, bowed in Thy presence, and graciously accept the
service in which we are engaged. May the meetings to be held in this
Asylum be under Thy protection and guidance, and may all its members be
of one mind to honor and

<span id="page_80">p. 80</span>

obey Thee, and love and protect one another. And may the work done in
this Asylum receive Thy approval and benediction.

And to thy great and holy Name shall be all the praise and glory,
through Jesus Christ our Saviour, <span class="smallcaps">Amen</span>.

GCG.—Sir Knights, <span class="smallcaps">Re-cover</span>!

GC.—Sir Knights, <span class="smallcaps">Be seated</span>! Give reverent
heed to the ceremony of Consecration, to the end that all may be endued
with a proper appreciation of the uses to which this Asylum is about to
be set apart.

Excellent Grand Prelate, place upon the Triangle the Holy Bible, opened
at the third chapter of the Gospel by John.

<span class="small">*Prelate places open Bible in center of
Triangle*.</span>

GC. (Rising and uncovering)—To God the Father, who so loved the world as
to give His Son to be the Captain of our Salvation, I dedicate this
Asylum. May Peace be within its walls. (*Re-covers*.)

GC.—Sir Knight Grand Generalissimo, place upon the Holy Bible an emblem
of Mortality.

<span class="small">*Grand Generalissimo places a skull upon the
Bible*.</span>

GC. (*Uncovering*)—To Him who hath abolished death, and hath brought
life and immortality to light through the Gospel, I Dedicate this
Asylum. May the unity of that Faith be maintained in this place.
(*Re-covers*.)

GC.—Sir Knight Grand Captain General, light the Tapers.

<span class="small">*The Grand Captain General lights the Tapers on the
Triangle*.</span>

<span id="page_81">p. 81</span>

GC.—To the memory of Hugh de Payen, the founder of the Order of the
Temple, I set this Asylum apart to the solemn uses of that Order. Sir
Knights, may brotherly love prevail, and every moral and social virtue
cement you.

<span class="small">MUSIC.</span>

<span class="small">"Nearer, My God, to Thee," or some other appropriate
Hymn, will be sung.</span>

GC.—Sir Knights, this Asylum thus solemnly set apart to the ceremonies
of our Order must not be profaned by improper assemblies, nor desecrated
by observances not in accord with the spirit of Christian Knighthood.
Guard well its doors from improper invasions, and allow none to enter
but such as are duly qualified when the trumpet of the Sentinel has
sounded the Assembly.

Here meet in the fear of God, and with the spirit of true and chivalrous
Knights. Be true to each other and to yourselves. Pray for the
prosperity of the Order, and diligently labor for the peace of the
Commandery of which you are members. You will arise and uncover.

We will now unite with our Excellent Grand Prelate in

<span class="small">PRAYER.</span>

<span class="smallcaps">Merciful</span> Father, we again thank Thee for
the pleasures of this sacred hour. Consecrate with Thy Benediction this
Asylum which Thy servant has so solemnly dedicated to Thee, so that all
things done herein may be prospered by Thy goodness and approved by Thy
wisdom.

Bless our beloved Order, wherever dispersed, and when the end shall
come, as come it will, may we all be received into that Rest which
remaineth to the people of God. Through Jesus Christ our Redeemer, <span
class="smallcaps">Amen</span>.

<span id="page_82">p. 82</span>

<span class="small">BENEDICTION.</span>

Grace be with you, mercy, and peace, from God the Father, and from the
Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love.

GC.—Sir Knights, <span class="smallcaps">Re-cover</span>! <span
class="smallcaps">Be seated</span>!
