<p>1. Give unremitting attention to the protection of the Ritual, and the Paraphernalia of your Commanderies. The first should never be out of your care, the other should be kept in perfect repair.</p>  
<p>2. Be certain that the Sentinel, or Janitor, has everything in readiness for the Conclaves of the Commanderies. The comfort of your Fratres should be an unremitting solicitude. Their attendance will be largely affected by your attention to this hint.</p>  
<p>3. See to it that your Fratres are provided with uniforms, but in doing so be not forgetful of the tenderness of many on matters that affect their purses. Persuade, but do not command. Some Grand Commanderies have a rule on this matter of uniforming. Enforce it in love.</p>  
<p>4. Do not begin the Opening Ceremonies until you are certain that the Asylum is in proper array, and all necessary arrangements are made.</p>  
<p>5. Permit no admissions during the Opening Ceremonies. Allow no conversation, not even whispering, while opening. Such interruptions seriously affect the solemnities.</p>  
<p>6. Never begin the Work until you are certain that everything is ready, in place, and in order. Halts to make search for missing paraphernalia are destructive to good Work.</p>  
<p>7. Permit no moving about the Asylum, conversation, or comments during the Work. This is of vital importance. Fratres who think they can not refrain from these disturbances should quietly withdraw to the Reception Room, or some other outer apartment. Be certain to make your request for absolute silence before you begin Work.</p>  
<p>8. Do not permit military drill during the Work. Form the Escort by arrangements made by the Captain General before the Work begins. Let the chosen Knights so sit that at the low-given command&#151;"Fall in"&#151;they may quietly step to their places, with Swords at a Carry. The formation by counting and facing breaks up all solemnity. And all military commands given should be in subdued tones of voice.</p>

<p>9. This Monitor favors the appearance of none at the D&#151;a, on the First Entrance, but the Eminent Commander, Senior Warden, and Cand. All others seated, and in silence. Asylum in full lights. This is one scene. Second Entrance finds Nine b&#151;d at D&#151;a, and <i>only</i> D&#151;a lights burning. This scene is entirely unlike the former,&#151;an important matter of progression. When the <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">PP.</span> re&#151;, the vacancy is symbolized as filled, and he and the two Wardens, with the Nine, make twelve also. The First is a series of Tests by the Chief; the Second is the Filling of the Vacancy caused by apostasy. If these points are kept in view the Lessons will be most imposing.</p>  
<p>10. The author of this Monitor believes that the laying down and taking up the C&#151;s at the Libs is destructive of solemnity. By the method herein suggested there are only two C&#151;s,&#151;one for the Eminent Commander, the other for the Cand. Nothing distracts his attention from the solemn Tests if practiced this way.</p>
