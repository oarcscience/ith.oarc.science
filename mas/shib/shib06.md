desire to thank thee for the many mercies and blessings with which thou
hast been pleased to crown our lives. We thank thee for this social and
fraternal intercourse with our Companions. Be mercifully near us at all

strengthen us in our journey through life, and deliverance from the
snares and pitfalls of the Evil One. Incline our hearts to seek thy
favor and protection, as our rightful Sovereign, that we may not be
impeded in the great work of erecting a spiritual edifice that shall
endure forever. Pardon all our sins, we beseech thee, and finally admit
us into the presence of the King of Kings, as members of his eternal
household. <span class="smallcaps">Amen</span>! Response, <span

beseech thee; put understanding in our minds, enlighten our eyes, and
cause our hearts to cleave to thy law. Because we have trusted in thy
Name we will rejoice and be glad in thy salvation, and in thy mercies, O
Lord, our God. Cause us to cleave unto thy great Name forever, and bring
upon us from the four corners of the earth the blessing of peace,
harmony and prosperity. Blessed art thou, O Lord God, who hast chosen
thy people in love. And when we have accomplished thy will upon earth
receive us to thyself, and unto thy great and holy Name shall be the
glory for ever and ever. <span class="smallcaps">Amen</span>! Response,
<span class="smallcaps">Amen</span>.
