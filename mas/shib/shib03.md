### NOTE BY THE PUBLISHERS.

<span class="smallcaps">So</span> far as known, the foregoing Preface is
the last word written by <span class="smallcaps">Sir George Cooper
Connor</span>, the author of this volume. Only a few days later he was
forced by disease to the chamber of death, which he never again left
until the end came.

The expression of his thanks in the last paragraph may therefore be
taken as his loving farewell to his brethren; and it is believed that
his earnest desire to provide a Monitor that should be complete and
helpful to the members of the Order has been fully realized in this new
edition of <span class="smallcaps">Shibboleth</span>, to the preparation
of which were given the last of his labors on earth.
