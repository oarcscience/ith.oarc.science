### RITUAL OF A COMMANDERY OF SORROW.

<span class="smallcaps">Grand Commanderies</span> often desire to hold
imposing Memorial Services in honor of their distinguished dead.
Subordinate Commanderies have the sane privilege. When the Ceremonials
are pathetic and tender, the results are most beneficial.

The ceremonies are public, and may be held in the Asylum, or in a public
hall.

<span id="img_18400"></span> <span align="CENTER"> [![ARRAY OF THE
HALL.](tn/18400.jpg)

ARRAY OF THE HALL.  
</span>

This diagram represents an elevated stage. 1, Commander; 2,
Generalissimo; 3, Captain General; 4, Prelate; 5, Commander of the
deceased Knight's commandery.

The three triangular tables should be 30 inches high, and have sides 15
inches long. They should each have a valance reaching to the floor. On
each table should be three tall tapers, all burning.

The Catafalque is properly shaped thus (end view):

<span id="img_18401"></span> ![Catafalque end view](img/18401.jpg.md)

<span id="page_185">p. 185</span>

It should be 32 inches long at the base, and the top part 24 inches
long. This gives a terrace 6 inches wide all around, on which should be
12 lighted tapers, four on the front, and four on each side. On the top
of the Catafalque a white urn may be placed, and all properly draped,
and decked with white flowers.

A large bell, best made out of a bar of steel, is suspended near the
chair of the commander, who will toll the same at the proper time.

A floral crown, and a floral cross should be prepared, and placed
convenient to the proper officers. A floral wreath should be wound
around a sword, and placed near the chair of the Captain General.

The Officers should be in full Templar costume, and the Prelate in
regulation robes. If possible, all the knights should be in full Templar
costume.

The music should be effectively rendered, and should be solemn and
pathetic.

The ceremonials should be conducted in a slow and measured manner,
solemnity and tenderness being the chief characteristics.

The officers enter in procession, and when they have taken their
stations the ceremonies will begin.

<span class="small">THE CEREMONIES.</span>

*Choir sings "Rock of Ages," or other appropriate music:*

<span class="smallcaps">Commander</span>.—Sir Knights, a Pilgrim
Warrior, a soldier of the Cross, a Companion beloved, has been summoned
hence. He has obeyed the summons and laid aside his armor. There is a
vacancy in the Grand Commandery of —;a vacant chair in our council
chamber. A taper has been extinguished here, to be relighted up yonder.

<span class="small">When the Commander says, "extinguished here," he
will pause, and extinguish the taper at the apex of his triangular
table. When he says, "to be relighted up yonder," he will relight the
taper.</span>

Beloved, we have gathered together to honor the memory of a Companion in
arms, Sir Knight —; to tender condolence to the bereaved, and to crave
permission to mingle our tears with theirs. The occasion is stricken
with sorrow,

<span id="page_186">p. 186</span>

but its poignancy is mollified by the preciousness of the hope of that
other life, where tears and sorrows are unknown. In the midst of life we
are in death; but unto whom shall we go for succor but unto Him who
tempers the wind to the shorn lamb. Excellent Prelate, read unto us from
the Father's will.

<span class="small">FIRST LESSON.</span>

<span class="small">*Prelate reads Job xiv: 1, 2, 5-14; 1 Corinthians
xv: 12-23*.</span>

P.—Man that is born of a woman is of few days, and full of trouble. He
cometh forth like a flower, and is cut down; he fleeth also as a shadow,
and continueth not. Seeing his days are determined, the number of his
months are with thee, thou hast appointed his bounds that he can not
pass, turn from him that he may rest till he shall accomplish, as an
hireling, his day. For there is hope of a tree if it be cut down that it
will sprout again, and that the tender branches thereof will not cease.
Though the root wax old in the earth, and the stock thereof die in the
ground, yet through the scent of water it will bud and bring forth
boughs like a plant.

But man dieth and wasteth away; yea, man giveth up the ghost, and where
is he? As the waters fail from the sea and the flood decayeth and drieth
up, so man lieth down and riseth not; till the heavens be no more they
shall not awake nor be raised out of their sleep.

If a man die shall he live again? All the days of my appointed time will
I wait, till my change come. Thou shalt call, and I will answer thee.

But if there be no resurrection of the dead, then is Christ not risen.
And if Christ be not risen, then is your preaching vain, and your faith
is also vain. \* \* \* For if the dead rise not, then is not Christ
raised; and if Christ is not

<span id="page_187">p. 187</span>

raised, your faith is vain; ye are yet in your sins. \* \* \* If in this
life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable.

But now is Christ risen from the dead, and become the first fruits of
them that slept. For since by man came death, by man came also the
resurrection of the dead. For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ
shall all be made alive. But every man in his order; Christ the first
fruits, afterward they that are Christ's at his coming.

Brethren, let us pray.

<span class="small">PRAYERS.</span>

<span class="smallcaps">Almighty</span> and most Merciful Father, who
has commended us to love one another as thy children, send down upon us
at this time the dew of thy heavenly grace; pardon all our
transgressions; renew within us right spirits, and refresh us with the
sweetness of thy love; give unto us faith and hope so that this, our
sorrow, may conduce to our eternal happiness. Look with compassion upon
these bereaved ones, and pour into their bleeding hearts the
consolations of thy grace; and may they have part and lot with all thy
saints, through Jesus Christ, our Lord. <span
class="smallcaps">Amen</span>.

<span class="smallcaps">Command</span> thy blessing, O God, to abide
with all who are sick or afflicted; with the widow and the orphan; with
the dying and the convalescent; with the poor and the distressed. Bestow
upon all the spirit of thy grace, and help us to bear each other's
burdens, so that having lived together in love here, we may, through the
merits of our once crucified, but now risen and exalted Redeemer, ascend
unto that peace that remaineth to the people of God, and forever unite
in singing the praises of redeeming love. And to thy great and matchless
name shall be all the praise and glory, through Jesus Christ, Emmanuel.
<span class="smallcaps">Amen</span>.

<span id="page_188">p. 188</span>

The grace of our Lord, Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the
fellowship of the Holy Ghost be with us all evermore. <span
class="smallcaps">Amen</span>.

CHOIR.—

<span class="small">ASLEEP IN JESUS.</span>

<span class="small"><span class="smallcaps">Tune</span>,
*Zephyr*.</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

1\. Asleep in Jesus! blessed sleep!  
From which none ever wake to weep;  
A calm and undisturbed repose.  
Unbroken by the last of foes.

2\. Asleep in Jesus! O how sweet  
To be for such a slumber meet;  
With holy confidence to sing  
That death bath lost its venomed sting.

3\. Asleep in Jesus! O for me  
May such a blissful refuge be;  
Securely shall my ashes lie,  
And wait the summons from on high.

4\. Asleep in Jesus! far from thee  
Thy kindred and their graves may be;  
But there is still a blessed sleep  
From which none ever wake to weep.

</div>

While the last verse is being sung the Commander will toll the Bell, and
the hall lights will be slowly lowered, until a dim light pervades.

<span class="small">THE CEREMONIES.</span>

<span class="small">*The Captain General will arise with the wreathed
sword in hand*.</span>

CG.—In the hands of our deceased Companion this sword was endowed with
three inestimable qualities—Justice, Fortitude and Mercy. Whenever he
grasped this glittering sword, his hand first laid hold upon the cross,
(*holding cross of sword upwards*), and before he drew it from its
scabbard he was well assured of the <span
class="smallcaps">Justice</span> of his cause.

<span id="page_189">p. 189</span>

I lay his Sword, wreathed with emblems of our affection, on this
Triangle dedicated to <span class="smallcaps">Justice</span>.

<span class="small">*The Captain General remains standing, and after a
pause the Generalissimo rises*.</span>

G. (*With floral Cross in hand*)—Our Companion delighted to wear upon
his breast this emblem of the Christian Faith. He could exclaim with the
apostle, "God forbid that I should glory save in the cross of our Lord,
Jesus Christ." May this (*raising the Cross*) be the token to admit him
where the wicked cease from troubling, and the weary are at rest.

To the memory of his Christian fidelity, courage and constancy, I lay
this emblem on the Triangle dedicated to <span
class="smallcaps">Fortitude</span>.

<span class="small">*The Generalissimo remains standing. A pause, then
the Commander rises*.</span>

C. (*With floral Crown in hand*)—" Be thou faithful unto death and I
will give thee a crown of life." Because our Companion was faithful do
we hope that a crown awaited him in that "house not made with hands,
eternal in the heavens." This emblem of that hope, (raising floral
Crown) I now deposit on the Triangle dedicated to <span
class="smallcaps">Mercy</span>.

Excellent Prelate, lead our Devotions.

P.—Beloved, let us kneel in prayer.

<span class="small">*The Choir will sing in soft, low voices:*</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">1. Just as I am, without one plea,  
But that thy blood was shed for me,  
And that thou bidst me come to thee,  
    O Lamb of God I come.</span>

</div>

<span id="page_190">p. 190</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

2\. Just as I am, thou wilt receive,  
Wilt welcome, pardon, cleanse, relieve;  
Because thy promise I believe,  
O Lamb of God I come.

3\. Just as I am, thy love unknown,  
Hath broken every barrier down;  
Now, to be thine, yea, thine alone,  
O Lamb of God I come.

</div>

<span class="small">*The Prelate will then offer the following, all
still kneeling:*</span>

<span class="small">PRAYER.</span>

<span class="smallcaps">Heavenly</span> Father, in whose holy sight
centuries are but as days, look down upon these bowed, weary pilgrims
who are traveling through this vale of tears, and soften their
afflictions with the consolations of thy Holy Spirit, the Comforter.
Accept the homage we bring, and permit us to come unto thee, O Lamb of
God, our Redeemer, so that there may be revived in each heart the hope
of eternal felicity, through Jesus Christ, our Saviour. <span
class="smallcaps">Amen</span>.

<span class="small">*As the word Amen is pronounced the lights of the
hall will be flashed up, and all will be seated*.</span>

<span class="small">THE CHANT OF MOURNING.</span>

<span class="small">*The Choir will then chant the following selection
of Scripture:*</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

In the day when the keepers of the house shall tremble, and the strong
men shall bow themselves and the grinders cease because they are few,
and those that look out of the windows be darkened.

And the doors shall be shut in the streets, when the sound of the
grinding is low, and he shall rise up at the voice of the bird, and all
the daughters of music shall be brought low;

</div>

<span id="page_191">p. 191</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Also when they shall be afraid of that which is high, and fears shall be
in the way, and the almond tree shall flourish, and the grasshopper
shall be a burden, and desire shall fail; because man goeth to his long
home, and the mourners go about the streets;

Or ever the silver cord be loosed, or the golden bowl be broken, or the
pitcher be broken at the fountain, or the wheel broken at the cistern.

Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was; and the spirit return
unto God who gave it.

</div>

<span class="small">ADDRESS BY THE COMMANDER.</span>

C.—Sir Knights, each bereavement severs a sordid cord that binds us to
this lower life, and stretches a golden one from earth to heaven. These
severings command a halt, send us into the solitude of reflection, and
enquire if we are able to answer the necessary questions, and wash our
hands in innocency, in token of our sincerity.

Brethren, the memory of him who falls in a just cause is forever
blessed. That just cause to us means defense of holy religion, feeding
the hungry, clothing the naked, and binding up the wounds of the
afflicted. It was in such a cause our Brother was engaged when he fell,
and his memory shall forever flourish in immortal green. Though he now
sleeps the long, undisturbed repose of death, his virtues are fresh, and
live in our hearts. In the darkness of the tomb his ashes but await the
summons of the resurrection, and his glorified spirit, we trust, is now
engaged in hymning the praises of redeeming love.

Let us, therefore, having hope in God, lay aside the drapery of our
mourning, and ascending out of the darkness of our grief into the light
of the promises of our Great Captain, perform this last duty to the
memory of our friend.

<span id="page_192">p. 192</span>

Companion Commander of — Commandery, on whose rolls the name of our
Frater was inscribed, receive the instructions of this Grand Commandery.

<span class="small">*The Commander arises, and meets the Grand Commander
in middle of stage*.</span>

Here on this scroll is inscribed the name, age and advancements of our
beloved Frater, now deceased. Bear it to your Asylum, and there deposit
it in the archives, in constant and perpetual memorial.

C.—Right Eminent Sir, I accept this memorial scroll in the name of —
Commandery. It shall be sacredly deposited in the archives.

<span class="small">*Both remain, facing the audience, when the Prelate
will say:*</span>

P.—"I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me, <span
class="smallcaps">Write</span>: from henceforth blessed are the dead who
die in the Lord; even so saith the spirit, for they rest from their
labors."

<span class="small">*The Commanders go to their stations, and all are
seated except Grand Commander*.</span>

C.—Sir Knights, these ceremonies have refreshed us, comforted our
hearts, and strengthened our faith. Let us all henceforth so let our
light shine that the world seeing, our good works may glorify our Father
who art in heaven. May we so live that when we die our friends will deem
it a pleasant duty to bestrew our graves with flowers, and thereby
cherish the memory of our virtues.

<span class="small">THE EULOGIUM.</span>

<span class="small">*The Eulogium will then be pronounced by the orator
selected*</span>

<span id="page_193">p. 193</span>

<span class="small">*After the Eulogium the Choir will sing, and the
congregation will arise and join*.</span>

<span class="small">THE CONSOLATORY.</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

1\. Forever with the Lord!  
Amen! so let it be;  
Life from the dead is in that word,  
’Tis immortality.

2\. Here in the body pent,  
Absent from thee I roam,  
Yet nightly pitch my moving tent  
A day's march nearer home.

3\. Forever with the Lord!  
Father, if ’tis thy will,  
The promise of that faithful word  
E’en here to me fulfill.

</div>

<span class="small">*The Excellent Prelate will then pronounce
the*</span>

<span class="small">BENEDICTION.</span>

The grace of the Lord, Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the
communion of the Holy Ghost be with you all. <span
class="smallcaps">Amen</span>.
