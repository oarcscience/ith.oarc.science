#### TO A SKULL.

Part of a poem found beside a skeleton in the Museum of the London Royal
College of Surgeons, author unknown. It was published in the Morning
Chronicle early in the present century.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Behold this ruin! ’Twas a skull  
Once of ethereal spirit full.  
This narrow cell was life's retreat;  
This space was thought's mysterious seat.  
What beauteous visions filled this spot!  
What dreams of pleasure long forgot!  
Nor hope, nor joy, nor love, nor fear  
Has left one trace of record here.

Beneath this mouldering canopy  
Once shone the bright and busy eye:  
But start not at the dismal void—  
If social love that eye employed,  
If with no lawless fire it gleamed,  
But through the dews of kindness beamed,  
That eye shall be forever bright  
When stars and sun are sunk in night.

Within this hollow cavern hung  
The ready, swift and tuneful tongue:  
If falsehood's honey it disdained,  
And when it could not praise was chained;  
If bold in virtue's cause it spoke—  
Yet gentle concord never broke—  
This silent tongue shall plead for thee  
When Time reveals Eternity!

</div>
