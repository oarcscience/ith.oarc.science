<p>"The adversaries of Judah and Benjamin heard that the children of the captivity builded the temple unto the Lord God of Israel." Ezra iv: 1.</p>  
<p>The "adversaries" are enumerated in verses 7, 8 and 9. The territory assigned to Judah was about forty-five miles long and fifty miles wide, and extended from the Jordan to the Mediterranean. The territory assigned to Benjamin was about twenty-six miles long and twelve miles wide. It extended from the Jordan to seven miles west of Jerusalem.</p>  
<p>These were the oldest and the youngest sons of Jacob, and they fell heir to Jerusalem, the Temple, and the glories of the Mosaic traditions, on the secession of the Ten Tribes under Rehoboam. Judah means "the praise of the Lord;" Benjamin means "the son of the right hand."</p>

<p>"And they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, God with us." Matt. i: 23.</p>  
<p>"Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel." Isaiah vii: 54.</p>  
<p>Emmanuel is the Greek form of the Hebrew Immanuel. Ahaz is informed of the birth of Messiah by Isaiah, and Matthew says this prophecy was accomplished in the birth of Christ.</p>  
<p>It was in its Greek form that the word was familiar to the Templars of old, as well as of to-day.</p>  
<p>"And thou shalt call his name Jesus: for he shall save his people from their sins." Matt. i: 21.</p>  
<p>Jesus is the Greek form of the Hebrew Joshua, or Jeshua, which is a contraction of Jehoshua, (Numbers xiii: 16.) Its literal meaning is "he of Jehovah," and we define it as "Saviour." Jesus Christ means " Anointed Saviour." As such is he adored by the Templar.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p>"And when they were come unto a place called Golgotha, that is to say, a place of a skull." Matt. xxvii: 33.</p>  
<p>Golgotha literally means "a heap of skulls," but three of the Evangelists define it as "a place of a skull." Luke says, "which is called Calvary," that is, "a skull." The Greek word is &#0954;&#0961;&#0945;&#0957;&#0964;&#0959;&#0957; which the Vulgate renders <i>Calvariam</i>, meaning "a bare skull." It is probable the name was given this elevation because of its peculiarly shaped summit.</p>  
<p>The awful tragedy enacted on Golgotha is dear to the true Templar, and he ever holds his sword in readiness to defend the religion founded upon that tragedy.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p>Moreover the Lord said unto me, Take thee a great roll, and write in it with a man's pen concerning Maher-shalal-hash-baz." Isaiah viii: i.</p>  
<p>An attempt at literal rendering of this passage would result in, "Take thee a great roll, and write in it with a man's pen concerning Make speed to the spoil, hasten the prey." The phrase is as difficult of translation as is the phrase, "Anathema Maran-atha." It means in its naked form, "Hasten-booty, Speed-spoil." It is pronounced <i>M&#257;-her sh&#259;l&#259;l h&#259;sh&acute;b&#259;z</i>.</p>  
<p>This phrase was cherished by the ancient Templars, who held it to be symbolical of that readiness for action which should characterize a true Soldier of Christ!</p>

<p>"At the same time came to them Tatnai, governor on this side the river, and Shethar-boznai, and their companions, and said thus unto them, Who hath commanded you to build this house and to make up this wall? " Ezra v: 3.</p>  
<p>This Tat na-i was Satrap of the province west of the Euphrates, next to Judea. Shethar-boz na-i was not a Satrap, but an officer of rank, and though his name meant "star of splendor," he united with Tatnai in an effort to shroud with gloom the hopes of the returned children of the captivity. God caused their wrath to praise him.</p>
