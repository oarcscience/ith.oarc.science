### CONCLUDING REMARKS.

*Acti labores jucundi*.

<span class="smallcaps">The</span> captives released under the decree of
the great Cyrus, issued B. C. 536, entered the desolated city of
Jerusalem on the 10th day of Tebeth, B. C. 535, under the leadership of
Zerubbabel. On the 23d day of Adar, B. C. 515, the Second Temple was
completed. It was dedicated, and the Priests and Levites assigned to
their duties.

The second installment of returning captives entered Jerusalem on the
10th of Schebet, B. C. 458, under the leadership of Ezra. He began a
reformation of the people by compelling them to put away their
unbelieving wives. The poor, impoverished, rain-soaked people obeyed the
imperative commands of this lineal descendant of Aaron when they had
assembled themselves in the city, five months afterwards. They put away
the wives they had brought up with them from Babylon, kept a solemn
fast, and entered into a covenant to walk in God's law, as given them by
his servant Moses.

The third installment entered Jerusalem, under the guidance of Nehemiah,
B. C. 445, when Nehemiah became Governor. Those who, for various
reasons, preferred to remain in the Persian country, were henceforth
known as "The Dispersion."

On the first day of Nisan, B. C. 445, a solemn fast was held, by order
of Nehemiah, and on the 24th day of the same month there was another. At
these Ezra read the Book of the Law of Moses to the people, and after
seven days they "rejoiced and feasted as they had not done since the
days of Joshua, the son of Nun." It was then they covenanted to keep the
seventh day, and the seventh year.

Thus was Israel re-established in Jerusalem, and the city and its Temple
rebuilt. Other cities were built, and peace was within their walls, and
prosperity within their palaces.

The ceremonials of the Illustrious Order of the Red Cross furnish ample
scope for the best of elocutionary work. Dignity of manner, clearness of
enunciation, and careful reading of the lines are absolutely necessary
to the full development of the Ritual.

<span id="page_30">p. 30</span>

A true Mason will lay down his life rather than surrender his integrity.
A Companion of the Red Cross holds his engagements sacred and
inviolable, and will not accept favors or emoluments at the sacrifice of
his integrity. Nor will he draw his sword in the cause of Injustice,
Falsehood, or Oppression, for <span class="smallcaps">Justice</span>,
<span class="smallcaps">Truth</span>, and <span
class="smallcaps">Liberty</span> are the Grand Characteristics of that
Illustrious Order.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Endurance, coupled with faith and perseverance, is a shining
characteristic of a Companion of the Red Cross. He is taught a lesson he
never forgets in the secession of the Ten Tribes of Israel, when told by
Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, that his father chastised them with whips,
but that he would chastise them with scorpions. They withdrew from their
allegiance, and left the tribes of <span class="smallcaps">Judah</span>
and <span class="smallcaps">Benjamin</span> in possession of Jerusalem,
its Temple, and the traditions. Their lack of patience and endurance,
under such trying circumstances, resulted in their disappearance as
tribes, or as a people. And to-day the Jews, scattered all over the face
of the earth, claim descent from the two patient tribes,—Judah and
Benjamin.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Those who seek to destroy their neighbors often overreach themselves as
did that Governor and nobleman of the Medo-Persian domain,—<span
class="smallcaps">Tatnai</span> and <span
class="smallcaps">Shethar-Boznai</span>. The search among the archives,
in Ecbatana, which they petitioned Darius to have made, resulted in the
discovery of the Decree made by Cyrus, which overthrew their hopes of
preventing the rebuilding of Jerusalem and its Temple. God often causes
the wrath of man to praise him.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

There is carved upon the Corner-Stone of the Illustrious Order of the
Red Cross this Motto: "<span class="smallcaps">Veritas</span>
*prævalebit*." And surely an Order so grounded is of infinite importance
to the human family. Verily, <span class="smallcaps">Truth</span> will
prevail.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

A Companion of the Red Cross has engraved upon his escutcheon these
words: "<span class="smallcaps">Libertas</span> *et natale solum*." Can
such a man be other than a good citizen? Aye, such men are willing to
shed their blood in defense of liberty and native land.

<span id="page_31">p. 31</span>

"Wo unto them that decree unrighteous decrees, and that write the
injustice that they have adjudged. Judge the poor with righteousness,
and according to equity relieve the lowly ones of earth. Execute true
judgment, and cause every one to show mercy and compassion to his
brother; and let none oppress the widow nor the fatherless, the stranger
nor the poor."

The origin of the device of the <span class="smallcaps">Eagle</span> on
royal banners can be traced to very early periods. It was the ensign of
the ancient Kings of the Medo-Persian empire, of Persia and Babylon. The
device was adopted by Charlemagne to denote the union of the black eagle
of the east with the golden eagle of the west, typifying the "Holy Roman
Empire."

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Sceptre (*Greek*, skeptron; Hebrew, *shebet*) means rod of command, or
staff of authority. It is the sign of power and authority, and is
therefore to be preferred, in the Creation of a Companion, to the use of
a Sword.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

This was the promise: Zerubbabel was appointed Governor, or Tirshatha
(Ezra ii: 63), of Judah by Darius. Of Zerubbabel God said: "Speak now to
Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua the
son of Josedech, the high priest, and to the residue of the people,
saying, Who *is* left among you that saw this house in her first glory?
and how do ye see it now? is *it* not in your eyes in comparison of it
as nothing? " Haggai ii: 2, 3.

"The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house; his
hands shall also finish it." Zechariah iv: 9.

#### SWORD CUTS—PASSES.

It is important to the purposes of this Monitor to describe only three
Cuts, and the Thrust. These are Ritualistic, and not military.

The regular Cuts of the Sword are: On left shoulder, <span
class="smallcaps">One</span>; on right shoulder, <span
class="smallcaps">Two</span>; on left leg, <span
class="smallcaps">Three</span>; on right leg, <span
class="smallcaps">Four</span>. This is the succession, ritualistically
speaking: Two, <span class="smallcaps">One</span>, <span
class="smallcaps">Three</span>, <span class="smallcaps">Four</span>.

<span id="page_32">p. 32</span>

The following illustrates these Cuts. The Swords numbered "1" are of the
First Division, and those numbered "2" are of the Second Division. The
Cuts are counted in illustration as given, and not as regularly numbered
Sword Cuts.

<span id="img_03200"></span> ![](img/03200.jpg)

These Cuts should be executed with the flat of the blade, and not with
the edge. The same side of the blade touches in every Cut. It is
important to remember this, and thereby avoid the awkward efforts
sometimes made to reverse the blade at each Cut.

These Cuts also illustrate "Over an Arch of Steel" (Cut Three) and
"Under an Arch of Steel" (Cut One).

#### "SALUTE" AND "PRESENT."
