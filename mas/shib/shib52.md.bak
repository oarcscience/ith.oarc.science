### THE CHRISTMAS OBSERVANCE.

<span class="smallcaps">The</span> Grand Encampment, at its Triennial
Conclave, Denver, 1892, gave its sanction to the Christmas Toast and
Response, which had been inaugurated by Sir Stephen Berry, of Portland,
Maine, and it made him Chairman of the Committee, *ad vitam!* He is
charged with the duty of annually preparing the sentiment.

\_\_\_\_\_

On Christmas Day the Knights will assemble in their Asylum one hour
before the official Hour of Observance, without uniforms. The hours are:

<div align="center">

|                                                        |                                                        |
|--------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*Eastern Tim*e, 12 noon.</span>    | <span class="small">*Central Time*, 11 o'clock.</span> |
| <span class="small">*Western Time*, 10 o'clock.</span> | <span class="small">*Pacific Time*, 9 o'clock.</span>  |

</div>

The Triangle will be placed in position, on which will be twelve
goblets, also one on the pedestal of the Commander. Glasses will be
provided for all the Templars present.

Allowing a sufficient time in which to perform the following exercises
before the Official Hour arrives, the Commander, Prelate and Recorder
will take their stations, the Knights will be seated as usual, and the
Commander will sound his gavel.

<span class="smallcaps">Choir</span>—

<span class="small">HARK, THE HERALD! 7s.</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

1\. Hark the herald! angels sing  
Glory to the new born king;  
Peace on earth, and mercy mild,  
God and sinners reconciled.

2\. See He lays his glory by;  
Born that man no more may die,  
Born to raise the sons of earth;  
Born to give them second birth!

</div>

<span id="page_195">p. 195</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">3. Hail the holy Prince of peace!  
Hail, the Son of righteousness!  
Light and life to all He brings,  
Risen with healing in His wings!</span>

</div>

<span class="small">*More elaborate Music may be used if desired by the
participants*.</span>

EC.—Excellent Prelate, read us the old, old story.

<span class="small">*Prelate reads Isaiah xi: I-5; Matthew is 18; Luke
ii: 4, 18-14*.</span>

P.—And there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse, and a
branch shall grow out of his roots. And the spirit of the Lord shall
rest upon him, the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of
counsel and might, the spirit of knowledge and the fear of the Lord; and
shall make of him quick understanding in the fear of the Lord; and he
shall not judge after the sight of his eyes, neither reprove after the
hearing of his ears.

With righteousness shall he judge the poor, and reprove with equity for
the meek of the earth; and he shall smite the earth with the rod of his
mouth, and with the breath of his lips shall he slay the wicked. And
righteousness shall be the girdle of his loins, and faithfulness the
girdle of his reins.

\*    \*    \*

Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise: when as his mother Mary
was espoused to Joseph, before they came together, she was found with
child of the Holy Ghost. Then Joseph her husband, being a just man, and
not willing to publicly expose her, was minded to put her away privily.

But while he thought on these things, behold, the angel of the Lord
appeared unto him in a dream, saying, Joseph, son of David, fear not to
take unto thee Mary thy wife; for that which is conceived in her is of
the Holy Ghost. And

<span id="page_196">p. 196</span>

she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name JESUS; for he
shall save his people from their sins.

Now all this came to pass, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken
of the Lord by the prophet, saying, Behold a virgin shall be with child,
and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel,
which being interpreted is, God with us.

\*    \*    \*

And Joseph went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into
Judea, unto the city of David, which is called Bethlehem.

And lo, an angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of the Lord
shone round about them; and they were sore afraid. And the angel said
unto them, fear not: for behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy,
which shall be to all people. For unto you is born this day in the city
of David a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord. \* \* \* And suddenly
there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God,
and saying,

<span class="smallcaps">Choir</span>.—Glory to God in the highest, and
on earth peace, good will among men.

<span class="small">*Then shall be sung in an adjacent room, but which
singing must be quite distinct in the Asylum, a solo:*</span>

<span class="small">LO! A STAR, YE SAGES HOARY.</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

1\. Lo! a star, ye sages hoary;  
Lo! a wondrous star above!  
He is born, the King of glory,  
He, our wondrous star of love.

2\. Lord of life, Redeemer, Master,  
Loud the shepherd's welcome rolls,  
He is born, the people's shepherd,  
Aye, the shepherd of our souls.

</div>

<span id="page_197">p. 197</span>

<span class="smallcaps">Choir</span>—(*Arranged as an Anthem*.)

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Praise God from whom all blessings flow;  
Praise Him all creatures here below;  
Praise Him above, ye heavenly host,  
Praise Father, Son and Holy Ghost.</span>

</div>

<span class="small">*If sung in long measure merely, all Templars
present should join*.</span>

EC.—Sir Knights, on this joyous day we commemorate the Birth of JESUS of
Nazareth, Emmanuel, author of our salvation, and the Great Captain under
whose Banner all of us have enlisted.

On this day 189— years ago, there was born in Bethlehem of Judea, one
who laid aside the god-head, and assumed mortal flesh; one whose glory,
worth and grace no language can express; one who was horn that our lives
might be purified, and who died that our souls might be redeemed from
the penalty of sin.

Let us, as true Soldiers of the Cross, strive to profit by the birth,
life, death, resurrection and ascension of that divine Master, and
remain His faithful soldiers unto death. Seeking strength to continue
that struggle let us now accompany our Excellent Prelate to the throne
of the heavenly grace. Excellent Prelate, lead our devotions.

*All arise, then kneel on the right knee, and how heads.*

*The Excellent Prelate will offer the following*

<span class="small">PRAYER.</span>

<span class="smallcaps">Almighty</span> and most merciful Father,
remember us with pity, we beseech thee, and blot out the multitude of
our transgressions, for thy beloved son's sake. And may the words of our
mouths, and the meditations of our hearts be acceptable in thy sight,
through Jesus Christ, our Lord.

<span class="smallcaps">All</span>.—<span class="smallcaps">Amen</span>!

<span id="page_198">p. 198</span>

<span class="smallcaps">Father</span> in heaven command thy blessing to
rest upon all true Knights of the Temple wherever dispersed; bestow upon
them a spirit of Truth, Justice, Courage, Constancy, Faith and Humility,
and make of them valiant defenders of thy holy religion. Teach them to
feed the hungry, clothe the naked, and bind up the wounds of the
afflicted, for Jesus' sake.

<span class="smallcaps">All</span>.—<span class="smallcaps">Amen</span>!

<span class="smallcaps">O Lord</span> command thy benediction to rest
upon our Grand Master. Help him to rule over us in love, and with an eye
single to thy glory. Save him from error, prejudice and pride; and while
giving him firmness of purpose to do right, help him to know the right,
for Christ's sake.

<span class="smallcaps">All</span>.—<span class="smallcaps">Amen</span>!

<span class="smallcaps">Father</span>, let thy choicest blessings be
with the President of the United States, and upon all in authority over
us. Endue them with wisdom from on high, and may it be their chiefest
joy to labor for thy glory, and the good of the people for whom they
legislate, and over whom they rule. Which we ask in the name of Jesus,
Emmanuel.

<span class="smallcaps">All</span>.—<span class="smallcaps">Amen</span>!

If there are any minutes to spare, conversation and congratulations will
now occur, while twelve Knights are being selected to form around the
Triangle. At exactly five minutes before the Official Hour the Eminent
Commander will sound his gavel, when all will he seated.

*The Eminent Commander will then say:*

EC.—Let the chosen twelve form around the Triangle. (*Done*) .

Let the water be poured into the goblets on the Triangle, and on the
Pedestal. (*Done*).

<span id="page_199">p. 199</span>

Let every Knight be furnished with a prepared goblet. (*Done*)

<span class="small">Thus prepared, there will be silence until two
minutes before the Hour. This Monitor does not suggest what the fluid
shall be, save at the Triangle, and on the Commander's pedestal. Some
will prefer wine, some water. The writer simply suggests to his Fratres
that even a semblance of intemperance should not be witnessed within an
Asylum of Knights Templar. Just two minutes before the hour:</span>

<span class="small">THE TOAST.</span>

EC.—Sir Knights, arise! Sir Knight Recorder, read the sentiment.

<span class="small">*The Recorder will read the sentiment, clear and
loud*.</span>

EC.—(*On the first stroke of the Hour*.) To our Grand Master! Drink.

<span class="small">*The Knights repeat," To our Grand Master," and
drink*.</span>

EC.—Sir Knight Recorder, read Grand Master' s Response.

<span class="small">*The Recorder will read the Response in a clear,
loud voice*.</span>

<span class="small">OTHER TOASTS.</span>

<span class="small">*The Eminent Commander will then offer the following
Toasts, which will be drank in the same manner as that to the Grand
Master*.</span>

1\. To the Grand Commander, Knights Templar, of —

2\. To all Knights Templar wherever dispersed.

3\. To all Knights Templar who have shed their blood in defense of
liberty and Christianity. (*Silence, and heads bowed; no drinking*).

4\. To the Grand Master of Masons in —

5\. To the Grand High Priest of the Royal Arch Chapter of —

<span id="page_200">p. 200</span>

<span class="small">IN MEMORIAM.</span>

EC.—Let us recall the virtues of the Fratres of our own jurisdiction who
have joined the silent majority.

<span class="small">*The Knights at the Triangle will lay their goblets
on the Triangle*.</span>

EC.—In memory of the dead of this jurisdiction during the year 189—

<span class="small">*The Knights at the Triangle will drop on the right
knee, all the Knights will bow their heads, and then will be sung, in
soft tones, by the Choir:*</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Nearer, my God to thee  
    Nearer to thee!  
E’en though it be a cross  
    That raiseth me;  
Still all my song shall be,  
Nearer, my God to thee,  
    Nearer to thee!</span>

</div>

EC.—Sir Knights, arise. We have been refreshed by these hallowed
memories, now let us receive the benediction of our Excellent Prelate.

<span class="small">BENEDICTION.</span>

P.—May the Lord bless thee and keep thee; may the Lord make His face to
shine upon thee and be gracious unto thee; may the Lord lift up His
countenance upon thee, and give thee peace.

<span class="smallcaps">End of the Observance</span>.
