# A FORM OF DIVINE WORSHIP

##### <span class="smallcaps">For the Use of Knights Templar on Ascension Day, and Other Occasions.</span>

<span class="smallcaps">The</span> following service is so arranged
that, by omitting and adding, it will be applicable to general public
occasions, and to Ascension Day.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

#### THE LITURGY.

When the Knights are entering the church or hall they will uncover as
they pass the door, and remain standing beside their seats. It is
desirable that Swords be not worn; they are so productive of noise and
disorder.

Then will be sung, all present participating:

<div align="center">

<table data-border="0">
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 100%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td data-valign="top"><p><span class="small">Holy Father, Holy Son,<br />
Holy Spirit, Three in One,<br />
Praise and glory be to thee<br />
Now and through eternity.</span></p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

</div>

P.—The Lord is in his holy temple; let all the earth keep silence before
him.

*All seated*.

*Choir will sing some Anthem appropriate to the occasion*.

*All arise*.

P.—What doth the Lord require of thee?

<span class="smallcaps">Knights</span>.—To do justly, love mercy, and
walk humbly with our God.

P.—O God, thou art my God; early will I seek thee.

<span id="page_175">p. 175</span>

<span class="smallcaps">Knights</span>.—My soul thirsteth for thee, my
flesh longeth for thee in a dry and thirsty land, where no water is.

P.—My soul followeth hard after thee.

<span class="smallcaps">Knights</span>.—Thy right hand upholdeth me.

P.—Hear my prayer, O God.

<span class="smallcaps">Knights</span>.—Attend unto my cry.

P.—God be merciful unto us, and bless us.

<span class="smallcaps">Knights</span>.—And cause his face to shine upon
us.

P.—Not unto us, not unto us, O Lord.

<span class="smallcaps">Knights</span>.—But unto thy great name be all
the glory.

P.—Blessing, and honor, and glory, and power be unto Him that sitteth
upon the throne.

<span class="smallcaps">Knights</span>.—And unto the Lamb for ever.

P.—Brethren, let us pray.

<span class="small">*The Knights, standing, will unite with the
Prelate*.</span>

OUR FATHER who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name; thy kingdom come,
thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily
bread, and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass
against us. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil,
for thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever and
ever. <span class="smallcaps">Amen</span>.

<span id="page_176">p. 176</span>

P.—God be merciful unto us, and bless us, and show us the light of His
countenance, and be very merciful unto us. <span
class="smallcaps">Amen</span>.

*Then shall be sung:*

<span class="small">THE CORONATION HYMN.</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

1\. All hail the power of Jesus’ name,  
   Let angels prostrate fall;  
Bring forth the royal diadem,  
   And crown Him Lord of all!

2\. Let every kindred, every tribe,  
   On this terrestrial ball,  
To Him all majesty ascribe,  
   And crown Him Lord of all!

3\. O that, with yonder sacred throng,  
   We at His feet might fall  
We'll join the everlasting song,  
   And crown Him Lord of all!

</div>

*Or the Te Deum may be sung instead of this Hymn.*

*Then the Prelate will read:*

<span class="smallcaps">The Lesson</span>.—Ezra vi: 1-15; Psalm li.

<span class="small">*If the occasion is Ascension Day—*</span>

<span class="smallcaps">The Lesson</span>.—Acts I: 1-9; Mark xvi: 14-20

<span class="small">*If Ascension Day, then will be sung (and the
Coronation Hymn will be omitted in place where given, but the Te Deum
maybe sung)—*</span>

<span class="small">KING OF KINGS AND LORD OF LORDS.</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

1\. Look ye, saints, the sight is glorious,  
  See the man of sorrows now;  
From the fight returned victorious,  
  Every knee to Him shall bow;  
       Crown Him, crown Him;  
  Crowns become the Victor's brow.

</div>

<span id="page_177">p. 177</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

2\. Crown the Savior, angels crown Him;  
  Rich the trophies Jesus brings;  
In the seat of power enthrone Him,  
  While the heavenly conclave rings;  
       Crown Him, crown Him;  
  Crown the Savior King of kings.

3\. Hark! those bursts of acclamation;  
  Hark! those loud triumphant chords;  
Jesus takes the highest station;  
  O what joy the sight affords!  
       Crown Him, crown Him;  
  King of kings, and Lord of lords.

</div>

<span class="small">*If not Ascension Day the above will be omitted, and
the Prelate will say, immediately after the Lesson:*</span>

P.—Let us pray.

<span class="small">*All will kneel*.</span>

<span class="smallcaps">Almighty</span> God, our Heavenly Father, King
of kings, and Lord of lords, we humbly bow ourselves at thy footstool,
and beseech thee to forgive our sins, and blot our transgressions from
before thee. Give unto each of us a clean heart, and renew within us a
right spirit. Lift upon us the light of thy countenance, and be
reconciled to us; and may the words of our mouths, and the meditations
of our hearts all be acceptable in thy sight, through Jesus Christ our
Lord. <span class="smallcaps">Amen</span>.

God spake these words and said: I am the Lord thy God; thou shalt have
no other gods before me.

<span class="smallcaps">Knights, or Choir</span>.—Lord have mercy upon
us, and incline our. hearts to keep this law.

P.—Thou shalt not make unto me any graven image, or any likeness of
anything that is in heaven above, or that is

<span id="page_178">p. 178</span>

in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth thou shalt
not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them; for I, the Lord thy God,
am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children
unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me; and showing
mercy unto thousands of them that love me, and keep my commandments.

<span class="smallcaps">Knights</span>.—Lord have mercy upon us, and
incline out hearts to keep this law.

P.—Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain; for the
Lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh His name in vain.

<span class="smallcaps">Knights</span>.—Lord have mercy upon us, and
incline our hearts to keep this law.

P.—Remember the sabbath day to keep it holy. Six days shalt thou labor,
and do all thy work; but the seventh day is the sabbath of the Lord thy
God; in it thou shalt not do any work, thou nor thy son, nor thy
daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor the
stranger that is within thy gates; for in six days the Lord made heaven
and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day;
wherefore the Lord blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it.

<span class="smallcaps">Knights</span>.—Lord have mercy upon us, and
incline our hearts to keep this law.

P.—Honor thy father and thy mother, that thy days may be long upon the
land which the Lord thy God giveth thee.

<span id="page_179">p. 179</span>

<span class="smallcaps">Knights</span>.—Lord have mercy upon us, and
incline our hearts to keep this law.

P.—Thou shalt not kill.

<span class="smallcaps">Knights</span>.—Lord have mercy upon us, and
incline our hearts to keep this law.

P.—Thou shalt not commit adultery.

<span class="smallcaps">Knights</span>.—Lord have mercy upon us, and
incline our hearts to keep this law.

P.—Thou shalt not steal.

<span class="smallcaps">Knights</span>.—Lord have mercy upon us, and
incline our hearts to keep this law.

P.—Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor.

<span class="smallcaps">Knights</span>.—Lord have mercy upon us, and
incline our hearts to keep this law.

P.—Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's house, thou shalt not covet thy
neighbor's wife, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his ox,
nor his ass, nor anything that is thy neighbor's.

<span class="smallcaps">Knights</span>.—Lord have mercy upon us, and
incline our hearts to keep this law.

\_\_\_\_

<span class="small">*Should it be desired to omit the Litany, on
Ascension Day, the following prayers shall be said by the Prelate
instead:*</span>

<span id="page_180">p. 180</span>

<span class="small">PRAYERS.</span>

<span class="smallcaps">Grant</span> we beseech thee Almighty Father,
that like as we believe thy Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, to have ascended
into heaven, so may we now in heart and mind thither ascend, and with
Him continually dwell, who liveth and reigneth with thee and the Holy
Spirit, world without end <span class="smallcaps">Amen</span>.

<span class="smallcaps">O God</span> our Father, who hast exalted thy
Son to thy right hand, leave us not comfortless we beseech thee, but
send down upon us the outpouring of thy Holy Spirit, the Comforter; and
in due time, if it so pleases thee, exalt us into thy presence, through
Jesus Christ, our Lord and Redeemer. <span
class="smallcaps">Amen</span>.

<span class="smallcaps">Merciful</span> Father, who on the Pentecostal
day didst illuminate the hearts of thy faithful children by sending unto
them the light and comfort of thy Holy Spirit, grant us at this time the
same spirit, that we may overcome the world and the allurements of the
flesh, for Jesus Christ's sake. <span class="smallcaps">Amen</span>.

<span class="small">*Should it be desired to omit the Commandments on
other occasions than Ascension Day, the Prelate will say the following
prayers:*</span>

<span class="smallcaps">We Thank Thee</span> Almighty Father, for the
memory of thy faithful servants who have fought the good fight, have
finished their course, and who kept the faith. Help us to imitate their
examples of holy living, and to follow them in all virtuous and godly
ways, through Jesus Christ, Emmanuel. <span
class="smallcaps">Amen</span>.

<span class="smallcaps">May</span> it please thee, O God, to guard and
govern with thy love our beloved Order of the Temple, its officers and

<span id="page_181">p. 181</span>

members; its widows and orphans; its sick and afflicted; its poor and
distressed. Bestow upon all the spirit of truth, charity, unity and
peace; help us to keep our vows, and maintain the faith; endue us with
innocency of life, purity of thought and conduct, and firmness of
purpose to do the right, through Jesus Christ, our Saviour. <span
class="smallcaps">Amen</span>.

<span class="smallcaps">Father</span> in heaven give to all nations the
promised time of peace; build up thy holy temple upon earth, and fill it
with thy glory; refresh all hearts with the sweetness of thy grace, and
may all done here below soon become pleasing in thy sight, for Jesus
Christ's sake. <span class="smallcaps">Amen</span>.

<span class="smallcaps">Our Father</span> who art in heaven, hallowed be
thy name; thy kingdom come, thy will be done on earth as it is in
heaven. Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses,
as we forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into
temptation, but deliver us from evil, for thine is the kingdom, and the
power, and the glory, for ever and ever. <span
class="smallcaps">Amen</span>.

*The Lord's Prayer shall be said at the close of the Ascension Day
prayers above.*

*All will arise.*

*The Prelate and Knights will repeat together on all occasions—*

<span class="small">THE CHRISTIAN'S CREED.</span>

I believe in God, the Father Almighty, maker of heaven and earth; and in
Jesus Christ His only Son, our Lord, who was conceived by the Holy
Ghost, born of the Virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate, was
crucified, dead and buried; He descended into hell; the third day He
arose from the dead, He ascended into heaven, and sitteth on the right
hand of God, the Father Almighty; from thence He shall come to judge the
quick and the dead.

<span id="page_182">p. 182</span>

I believe in the Holy Ghost, the holy catholic church, the communion of
saints, the forgiveness' of sin, the resurrection of the body, and the
life everlasting. <span class="smallcaps">Amen</span>!

<span class="small">OR THIS:</span>

I believe in God, the Father Almighty; and in Jesus Christ, His only
Son, our Lord, who was by the Holy Ghost born of the Virgin Mary,
suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified and buried; the third day
He arose from the

dead; He ascended into heaven, and sitteth at the right hand of the
Father; from thence He shall come to judge the quick and the dead.

I believe in the Holy Ghost, the Holy Church, the forgiveness of sin,
the resurrection of the body, and the life everlasting. <span
class="smallcaps">Amen</span>!

*If the occasion is Ascension Day, the following will be sung:*

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

1\. In the cross of Christ I glory,  
  Towering o’er the wrecks of time;  
All the light of sacred story,  
  Gathers ’round its head sublime.

2\. When the woes of life o’ertake me,  
  Hopes deceive, and fears annoy,  
Never shall the Cross forsake me;  
  Lo! it glows with peace and joy.

3\. Bane and blessing, pain and pleasure,  
  By the Cross are sanctified.  
Peace is there, that knows no measure,  
  Joys that through all time abide.

</div>

<span class="small">*If the occasion is other than Ascension Day, the
following will be sung:*</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

1\. From every stormy wind that blows,  
From every swelling tide of woes,  
There is a calm, a sure retreat,  
’Tis found beneath the Mercy Seat.

</div>

<span id="page_183">p. 183</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

2\. There is a scene where spirits blend;  
Where friends hold fellowship with friends;  
Though sundered far, by faith they meet  
Around one common Mercy Seat.

3\. There, there on eagle wings we soar,  
And sin and sense molest no more,  
And heaven comes down our souls to greet,  
And glory crowns the Mercy Seat.

</div>

*Sermon or Address*.

<span class="small">DOXOLOGY.</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Praise God from whom all blessings flow,  
Praise Him all creatures here below,  
Praise Him above, ye heavenly host,  
Praise Father, Son and Holy Ghost.

</div>

<span class="small">BENEDICTION.</span>

The blessing of God Almighty, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit,
be amongst you, and remain with you always. <span
class="smallcaps">Amen</span>!
