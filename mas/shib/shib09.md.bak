#### THE IMMEMORIAL DISCUSSION.

On the morning succeeding the great feast at the capital of the Persian
empire, Darius listened to the oratorical contests of the three Guards
of the Bed-chamber, in reply to the question, "Which is the greatest,
the strength of <span class="smallcaps">Wine</span>, the power of the
<span class="smallcaps">King</span>, or the influence of <span
class="smallcaps">Woman</span>?"

##### THE STRENGTH OF WINE.

O ye Princes and Rulers, how exceeding strong is Wine! it causeth all
men to err that drink it; it maketh the mind of the King and the beggar
to be all one; of the bondman and freeman, of the poor man and the rich;
it turneth also every thought into jollity and mirth, so that a man
remembereth neither sorrow nor debt; it changeth and elevateth the
spirits, and enliveneth the heavy hearts of the miserable. It maketh a
man forget his brethren and draw his sword against his best friends. O
ye Princes and Rulers, is not Wine the strongest, that forceth us to do
these things?

<span id="page_23">p. 23</span>

##### THE POWER OF THE KING.

It is beyond dispute, O Princes and Rulers, that God has made man master
of all things under the sun; to command them, to make use of them, and
to apply them to his service as he pleases; but, whereas men have only
dominion over other sublunary creatures, Kings have an authority even
over men themselves, and a right of ruling them by will and pleasure.

Now, he that is master of those who are masters of all things else, hath
no earthly thing above him.

<span id="img_starsep"></span> ![](img/starsep.jpg)

##### THE INFLUENCE OF WOMAN.

O Princes and Rulers, the force of wine is not to be denied, neither is
that of Kings, that unites so many men in one common bond of allegiance;
but, the supereminency of Woman is yet above all this: for Kings are but
the gifts of women, and they are also the mothers of those that
cultivate our vineyards. Women have power to make us abandon our very
country and relations, and many times to forget the best friends we have
in the world, and, forsaking all . other comforts, to live and die with
them.

But when all is said, neither they, nor Wine, nor Kings are comparable
to the almighty force of Truth.

As for all other things, they are mortal and transient, but Truth alone
is unchangeable and everlasting; the benefits we receive from it are
subject to no variations or vicissitudes of time or fortune.

In her judgment is no unrighteousness, and she is the strength, wisdom,
power, and majesty of all ages.

<span id="img_starsep"></span> ![](img/starsep.jpg)

<span id="page_24">p. 24</span>

"Great is <span class="smallcaps">Truth</span>, and mighty above all
things."

"<span class="smallcaps">Blessed be the God of Truth</span>."

<span id="img_starsep"></span> ![](img/starsep.jpg)

#### THE PLEA FOR REMEMBRANCE.

O King, remember thy vow, which thou hast vowed, to build Jerusalem in
the day when thou shouldst come to thy kingdom, and restore the holy
vessels which were taken away out of Jerusalem. Thou hast also vowed to
build up the Temple, which was burned when Judah was made desolate by
the Chaldees.

And now, O King, this is that I desire of thee, that thou make good the
vow, the performance whereof with thine own mouth thou hast vowed to the
King of Heaven.

<span id="img_starsep"></span> ![](img/starsep.jpg)

#### THE DECREE.

Moreover, I make a decree what ye shall do to the elders of these Jews
for the building of this house of God: that of the king's goods, *even*
of the tribute beyond the river, forthwith expenses be given unto these
men, that they be not hindered. And that which they have need of, both
young bullocks, and rams, and lambs, for the burnt offerings of the God
of heaven, wheat, salt, wine, and oil, according to the appointment of
the priests which *are* at Jerusalem, let it be given them day by day
without fail: that they may offer sacrifices of sweet savours unto the
God of heaven, and pray for the life of the king, and of his sons. Also
I have made a decree, that whosoever shall alter this word, let timber
be pulled down from his house, and being set up, let him be hanged
thereon; and let his house be made a dunghill for this. Ezra vi: 8-11

#### FOUNDING THE NEW ORDER.

<span id="img_starsep"></span> ![](img/starsep.jpg)

##### THE VOW.

1.      2.      3.      4.      5.      6.

The Princes of Persia and Rulers of the Medes having arisen to witness
the Vow, resume their seats with approbation.

<span id="img_starsep"></span> ![](img/starsep.jpg)

##### THE GREEN SASH.

To the Royal Prince it was a perpetual incentive to the performance of
every duty; to a Companion of the Red Cross it is a reminder that <span
class="smallcaps">Truth</span> is a divine attribute, and the foundation
of every virtue.

<span id="img_starsep"></span> ![](img/starsep.jpg)

##### THE SWORD.

It is worthy of being worn by a Companion of the Red Cross, as well as
by the Crown Prince of the House of Judah.

<span id="img_starsep"></span> ![](img/starsep.jpg)

##### MEANS OF RECOGNITION.

<span id="img_starsep"></span> ![](img/starsep.jpg)

##### THE BANNER OF THE ORDER.

The Banner of the Order is of green color. In its center there is a Star
of seven points, within which is a red Cross of equal arms and angles,
surrounded by the <span class="smallcaps">Motto</span>: "*Magna est
Veritas, et Prævalebit*,"—"Great is Truth, and it will Prevail."

##### THE CROSS OF THE ORDER.

The Cross of the Order is of equal arms and angles, of blood-red color,
with the letters D T J L on the extremities of the arms. The arms
indicate <span class="smallcaps">Deity</span>, <span
class="smallcaps">Truth</span>, <span class="smallcaps">Justice</span>,
<span class="smallcaps">Liberty</span>.

<span id="img_starsep"></span> ![](img/starsep.jpg)

<span id="page_26">p. 26</span>

##### THE WELCOME.

With joy the new Companion is welcomed to a seat among his Companions.

<span id="img_starsep"></span> ![](img/starsep.jpg)

##### THE BANQUET.

Never was banquet spread under more joyous surroundings. It is
invariably served after the Council closes, if served at all.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

##### TO CLOSE THE COUNCIL.

The same precautionary steps precede the Closing as precede the Opening
of a Council of the Illustrious Order of the Red Cross.

<span id="img_note0"></span> ![](img/note0.jpg)

The Sovereign Master, in his discretion, may hold Rehearsal of Duties
before closing.

<span id="img_starsep"></span> ![](img/starsep.jpg)

##### PRAYER

O LORD our God, we thank thee, we praise thee, we magnify thee for the
gift of thy holy Light. Make it to shine into our hearts, and write thy
Law upon our consciences.

And now as we go out into, the world again may the words of our mouths,
and the meditations of our hearts, be acceptable in thy sight, O Lord,
our strength and our redeemer. <span class="smallcaps">Amen</span>!
Response, <span class="smallcaps">Amen</span>!

<span id="img_starsep"></span> ![](img/starsep.jpg)

S.M.—Companions, the priceless Jewels of humanity are "the beauty of
<span class="smallcaps">Love</span>, the charm of <span
class="smallcaps">Friendship</span>, the sacredness of <span
class="smallcaps">Sorrow</span>, the heroism of <span
class="smallcaps">Patience</span>, the courage of <span
class="smallcaps">Truth</span>"! Go in peace, and, "May the Lord bless
thee, and keep thee: the Lord make his face shine upon thee, and be
gracious unto thee: the Lord lift up his countenance upon thee, and give
thee peace."
