### PREFACE TO FIFTH EDITION.

<span class="smallcaps">The</span> early demand for the Fifth Edition of
<span class="smallcaps">Shibboleth</span>, a demand the publishers
scarcely anticipated in times like these, affords the author an
opportunity to add several important matters to the volume, thus
rendering it still more valuable to the Order of the Temple. So far as
now seen this edition is a complete Monitor.

This edition contains all that appeared in the Fourth Edition, with a
few errors corrected, and the Banners of Judah and Persia. There is also
added a "Third Appendix," which contains directions for the Reception of
Grand Officers; Hints to Eminent Commanders, and Rules of Order; Rituals
for Divine Worship; Ritual of a Conclave of Sorrow; Ritual for the
Christmas Observance; a Form for Recorder's Minutes; an Arrangement of
Asylum and Prelate's Hall; and some Hints on Templar Banquets.

This Monitor reaches farther in its helpfulness than any that has been
prepared heretofore. But it has not attempted to describe the Robes, and
other equipments not universally accepted by the Order. Many requests
have been made for the insertion of such descriptive matter, and the
requests have been declined in the interests of peace. Such an attempt
would develop acrimonious controversies.

My thanks are due, and they are hereby returned to the Fratres all over
the Union, from Maine to Mexico, and the Atlantic to the Pacific, for
the kind reception given the former editions of this Monitor, and for
the many valuable hints received from all sources. It is the author's
sincere desire to make this volume complete in all respects, and he will
still be grateful for all suggestions looking to such completeness.
