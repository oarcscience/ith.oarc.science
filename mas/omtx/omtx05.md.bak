# FELLOW-CRAFT'S DEGREE

\[Masonry, like all other sciences, is progressive, and can only be
acquired by degrees, and at intervals. When an Entered Apprentice has
served the proper time, and learned properly the Ritual of the first
degree, he can, and it is his duty (if he is a good and true
Apprentice), to apply through a member of the Lodge for the second, or
Fellow-Craft's Degree.

This application can he made orally, at a stated meeting, but before the
applicant can be balloted for, he must be examined in an Entered
Apprentice Lodge as to his proficiency in the first degree, and if
(after closing the E. A. Lodge, and calling to labor in the Master's
Degree), said examination is declared satisfactory, by the vote of the
brethren present, the Lodge will proceed to ballot upon said
application.\]

\[This degree is divided into two sections, the first of which is
entirely ceremonial, and the Lecture pertaining to the same is but a
recapitulation of the ceremonies used on the occasion, and should be
well understood by every member of the Lodge, but more especially, by
the officers.\]

## SECTION I

\[The following passage of Scripture is rehearsed during the ceremony of
the first section:\]

"Thus he shewed me; and behold the Lord stood upon a wall made by

<span id="page_38">p. 38</span>

a plumb line, with a plumb line in His hand. And the Lord said unto me,
Amos, what seest thou? And I said, a plumb line, Thus saith the Lord,
Behold, I will set a plumb line in the midst of my people Israel; I will
not again pass by them any more."

Or the following Ode may be sung:

Come, Craftsmen, assembled, our pleasure to share,  
Who work by the Plumb, and remember the Square;  
While trav’ling, in love, on the Level of time,  
Sweet hope shall light on to a far better clime.

We'll seek, in our labors, the Spirit Divine,  
Our temple to bless, and our hearts to refine;  
And thus to our altar a tribute we'll bring,  
While joined in true friendship our an-them we sing.

See Order and Beauty rise gently to view.  
Each Brother a column, so perfect and true!  
When Order shall cease, and when temples decay,  
May each fairer columns, immortal, survey.

### The Working Tools of a Fellow-Craft

Are the Plumb, Square and Level.

<span id="page_39">p. 39</span>

The Plumb is an instrument made use of by operative Masons to raise
perpendiculars, the Square to square their work, and the Level to lay
horizontals; but we, as Free and Accepted Masons, are taught to make use
of them for more noble and glorious purposes; the Plumb admonishes us to
walk uprightly in our several stations before God and man, squaring our
actions by the Square of Virtue, and remembering that we are traveling
upon the Level of Time, to "that undiscovered country, from whose bourne
no traveler returns."

\[This section closes with a practical illustration of the manner in
which Our Ancient Brethren gained admission into the middle chamber of
King Solomon's Temple.\]

## SECTION II

The Second Section \* \* \* \* \* and treats of Masonry under two de
nominations, Operative and Speculative.

\[The Terrestrial and Celestial Globes, the Orders of Architecture, the
Human Senses and the Liberal Arts and Sciences are here introduced and
explained, and the learned and accomplished Mason may display his
talents and skill in their elucidation.\]

<span id="page_40">p. 40</span>

### Operative Masonry

By Operative Masonry we allude to a proper application of the useful
rules of architecture, whence a structure will derive figure, strength
and beauty, and whence will result a due proportion, and a just
correspondence in all its parts. It furnishes us with dwellings and
convenient shelters from the vicissitudes and inclemencies of seasons,
and while it displays the effects of human wisdom, as well in the choice
as in the arrangement of the sundry materials of which an edifice is
composed, it demonstrates that a fund of science and industry is
implanted in man, for the best, most salutary and beneficent purposes.

### Speculative Masonry

By Speculative Masonry we learn to subdue the passions, act upon the
square, keep a tongue of good report, maintain secrecy, and practice
charity. It is so far interwoven with religion as to lay us under
obligations to pay that rational homage to the Deity, which at once
constitutes our duty and our happiness.

It leads the contemplative to view with reverence and admiration the

<span id="page_41">p. 41</span>

glorious works of creation, and inspires him with the most exalted ideas
of the perfection of his divine Creator.

Our ancient brethren, in obedience to God's law, labored six days and
rested on the seventh, thereby enjoying frequent opportunities to
contemplate the glorious works of the creation, and to adore the Great
Creator.

\[The emblems of Unity, Peace and Plenty are explained in connection
with these pillars.\]

### The Globes

Are two artificial spherical bodies \* \* \* \* \*, upon the convex
surface of which are delineated various portions of the earth's surface,
the planetary revolutions, fixed stars, and other particulars.

\[The five orders of Architecture next require attention. By order in
Architecture is meant a system of all the members, proportions and
ornaments of columns and pilasters.

Its antiquity claims particular attention. From the first formation of
society, order in architecture may be traced. When the rigor of the
seasons first obliged man to contrive shelter from the inclemency of the
weather, we learn that they planted trees on end, and then laid others
across to support a covering. The bands which connected those trees at
the top and bottom are said to have given rise to the

<span id="page_42">p. 42</span>

idea of the base and capital of pillars; and from this simple hint,
originally proceeded the more improved art of architecture.\]

### THE FIVE ORDERS OF ARCHITECTURE

Are the Tuscan, Doris, Ionic, Corinthian and Composite.

#### The Tuscan

Is the most simple and solid of the five orders. It was invented in
Tuscany, whence it derives its name. \[Its column is seven diameters
high, and its capital, base and entablature have but few mouldings. The
simplicity of the construction of this column renders it eligible where
ornament would be superfluous.\]

#### The Doric

Which is plain and natural, is the most ancient, and was invented by the
Greeks. \[Its column is eight diameters high, and has seldom any
ornaments on base or capital, except mouldings; though the frieze is
distinguished by triglyphs and metopes, and triglyphs compose the
ornaments of the frieze. The solid composition of this Order gives it a
preference in structures where strength and noble simplicity are chiefly
required.

The Doric is the best proportioned of all the orders. The several parts
of which it is composed are founded on the natural position of solid
bodies. In its first invention it was more simple than in its present

<span id="page_43">p. 43</span>

state. In after times, when it began to be adorned, it gained the name
of Doric; for when it was constructed in its primitive and simple form,
the name of Tuscan was conferred on it. Hence the Tuscan precedes the
Doric in rank, on account of its resemblance to that pillar in its
original state.\]

#### The Ionic

Bears a kind of mean proportion between the more solid and delicate
orders. \[Its column is nine diameters high; its capital is adorned with
volutes, and its cornices have dentals. There are both delicacy and
ingenuity displayed in this pillar; the invention of which it attributed
to the Ionians, as the famous temple of Diana, at Ephesus, was of this
order. It is said to have been formed after the model of an agreeable
young woman of an elegant shape, dressed in her hair, in contrast to the
Doric order, which was formed after that of a strong, robust man.\]

#### The Corinthian

The richest of the five orders, is deemed a masterpiece of art. \[Its
column is ten diameters high, and its capital is adorned with two rows
of leaves, and eight volutes, which sustain the abacus. The frieze is
ornamented with curious devices, the cornice with dentals and
modillions. This order is used in stately and superb structures. It was
invented at Corinth, by Callimachus, who is said to have taken the hint
of the capital of this pillar from the following remarkable
circumstances: Accidentally passing by the tomb of a young lady, he
perceived a basket of toys,

<span id="page_44">p. 44</span>

covered with a tile, placed over an acanthus root, it having been left
there by her nurse. As the branches grew up, they compassed the basket,
till, arriving at the tile, they met with an obstruction and bent
downward. Callimachus, struck with the object, set about imitating the
figure; the vase of the capital he made to represent the basket; the
abacus the tile; and the volutes the bending leaves.\]

#### The Composite

Is compounded of the other orders, and was contrived by the Romans.
\[its capital has the two rows of leaves of the Corinthian, and the
volutes of the Ionic. Its column has the quarter-round, as the Tuscan
and Doric order; is ten diameters high, and its cornice has denticles,
or simple modillions. This pillar is generally found in buildings where
strength, elegance and beauty are displayed.\]

Three of these orders, the Doric, Ionic and Corinthian, are only revered
by Masons, for these alone show invention and were invented by the
Greeks); the others differ only by accident, and were added by the
Romans. Hence it is to the Greeks, and not to the Romans, that we are
indebted for all that is great, judicious and distinct in architecture.

### THE FIVE HUMAN SENSES

Are Seeing, Hearing, Feeling, Smelling

<span id="page_45">p. 45</span>

and Tasting, (and are next in order for explanation):

#### Seeing

Is that sense by which we distinguish objects, and in an instant of
time, without change of place or situation, view armies in battle array,
figures of the most stately structures, and all the agreeable variety
displayed in the landscape of nature. \[By this sense we find our way on
the pathless ocean, traverse the globe of earth, determine its figure
and dimensions, and delineate any region or quarter of it. By it we
measure the planetary orbs, and make new discoveries in the sphere of
the fixed stars. Nay more; by it we perceive the tempers and
dispositions, the passions and affections of our fellow-creatures, when
they wish most to conceal them; so that, though the tongue may be taught
to lie and dissemble, the countenance would display the hypocrisy to the
discerning eye. In fine, the rays of light which minister to this sense,
render the eye a peculiar object of admiration, and the most astonishing
part of the animated creation.\]

#### Hearing

Is that sense by which we distinguish sounds and are capable of
appreciating the agreeable charms of music. \[By it, we are enabled to
enjoy the pleasures of society, and reciprocally to communicate to each
other our thoughts and intentions, our purposes and desires; and thus
our reason is rendered capable of exerting its utmost power and energy.
The wise and

<span id="page_46">p. 46</span>

beneficent Author of Nature intended, by the formation of this sense,
that we should be social creatures, and receive the greatest and most
important part of our knowledge from social intercourse with each other.
For these purposes we are endowed with hearing, that, by a proper
exertion of our rational powers, our happiness may be complete.\]

#### Feeling

Is that sense by which we distinguish the different qualities of bodies,
such as heat and cold, hardness and softness, roughness and smoothness,
figure, solidity, motion and extension.

#### Smelling

Is that sense by which we distinguish odors, the various kinds of which
convey different impressions to the mind. \[Animal and vegetable bodies,
and indeed most other bodies, while exposed to air, continually send
forth effluvia of vast subtlety, as well in the state of life and growth
as in the state of fermentation and putrefaction. These effluvia, being
drawn into the nostrils along with the air, are the means by which all
bodies are smelled. Hence it is evident that there is a manifest
appearance of design in the great Creator's having planted the organ of
smell in the inside of that canal, through which the air continually
passes in respiration.\]

#### Tasting

Enables us to make a proper distinction in the choice of our food. \[The
organ of

<span id="page_47">p. 47</span>

this sense guards the entrance of the alimentary canal, as that of smell
guards the entrance of the canal for respiration. From the situation of
both these organs, it is plain that they are intended by nature to
distinguish wholesome food from that which is nauseous. Everything that
enters into the stomach must undergo the scrutiny of tasting; and by it
we are capable of discerning the changes which the same body undergoes
in the different compositions of art, cookery, chemistry, pharmacy,
etc.\]

Smelling and Tasting are inseparably connected, and it is by the
unnatural kind of life men commonly lead in society that these senses
are rendered less fit to perform their natural offices.

Three of which, Seeing, Hearing and Feeling, are principally revered by
Masons.

### THE SEVEN LIBERAL ARTS AND SCIENCES

Are Grammar, Rhetoric, Logic, Arithmetic, Geometry, Music and Astronomy
(and are illustrated in this section as follows):

#### Grammar

Is the key by which alone a door can be opened to the understanding of
speech. \[It is Grammar which reveals the admirable art of language and
unfolds its various constituent parts, its names, definitions

<span id="page_48">p. 48</span>

and respective offices; it unravels, as it were, the thread of which the
web of speech is composed. These reflections seldom occur to any one
before their acquaintance with the art; yet it is most certain that,
without a knowledge of Grammar, it is very difficult to speak with
propriety, precision and purity.\]

#### Rhetoric

It is by Rhetoric that the art of speaking eloquently is acquired. \[To
be an eloquent speaker, in the proper sense of the word, is far from
being either a common or an easy attainment; it is the art of being
persuasive and commanding; the art not only of pleasing the fancy, but
of speaking both to the understanding and to the heart.\]

#### Logic

Is that science which directs us how to form clear and distinct ideas of
things, and thereby prevents us from being misled by their similitude,
or resemblance. \[Of all the human sciences, that concerning man is
certainly most worthy of man. The precise business of Logic is to
ex-plain the nature of the human mind, and the proper manner of
conducting its several powers in the attainment of truth and knowledge.
This science ought to be cultivated as the foundation, or ground-work of
our inquiries; particularly in the pursuit of those sublime principles
which claim our attention as Masons.\]

#### Arithmetic

Is the art of numbering, or that part of the mathematics which considers
he

<span id="page_49">p. 49</span>

properties of numbers in general. \[We have but a very imperfect idea of
things without quantity, and as imperfect of quantity itself, without
the help of Arithmetic.\]

#### Geometry

This science usually treats of the magnitude of bodies. \[Magnitude has
three dimensions, length, breadth and thickness.\]

#### Music

Is that elevated science which affects the passions by sound. \[There
are few who have not felt its charms and acknowledged its expressions to
be intelligible to the heart. It is a language of delightful sensations,
far more eloquent than words; it breathes to the ear the clearest
intimations; it touches, and gently agitates the agreeable and sublime
passions; it wraps us in melancholy, and elevates us in joy; it
dissolves and inflames; it melts us in tenderness and excites to war.
This science is truly congenial to the nature of man, for, by its
powerful charms, the most discordant passions may be harmonized and
brought into perfect unison, but it never sounds with such seraphic
harmony as when employed in singing hymns of gratitude to the Creator of
the Universe.\]

#### Astronomy

Is that sublime science which inspires the contemplative mind to soar
aloft and read the wisdom, strength and beauty of the great Creator in
the heavens. \[How nobly eloquent of the Deity is the celestial
hemisphere!--spangled with the most magnificent

<span id="page_50">p. 50</span>

heralds of His infinite glory! They speak to the whole universe; for
there is neither speech so barbarous but their language is understood,
nor nations so distant but their voices are heard among them.

The heavens proclaim the glory of God;  
The firmament declareth the works of his hands."

Assisted by Astronomy, we ascertain the laws which govern the heavenly
bodies, and by which their motions are directed; investigate the power
by which they circulate in their orbs, discover their size, determine
their distance, explain their various phenomena, and correct the fallacy
of the senses by the light of truth.\]

The fifth of these sciences, Geometry, is deemed principally essential
in Masonry.

By it the architect is enabled to construct his plans and execute his
de-signs; the general, to arrange his soldiers; the engineer to mark out
grounds for encampments; the geographer to give us the dimensions of the
world, and all things therein contained; to delineate the extent of
seas, and specify the divisions of empires, kingdoms and provinces. By
it, also the astronomer is enabled to make his observations, and to fix
the durations

<span id="page_51">p. 51</span>

of times and seasons, years and cycles. In fine, Geometry is the
foundation of architecture and the root of mathematics.

### The Moral Advantages of Geometry

Geometry, the first and noblest of sciences, is the basis on which the
superstructure of Freemasonry is erected. By Geometry we may curiously
trace nature, through her various windings, to her most concealed
recesses. By it we discover the power, wisdom and goodness of the Grand
Artificer of the Universe, and view with delight the proportions which
connect this vast machine. By it we discover how the planets move in
their different orbits, and demonstrate their various revolutions.

By it we account for the return of seasons, and the variety of scenes
which each season displays to the discerning eye.

Numberless worlds are around as (all framed by the same Divine Artist),
which roll through the vast expanse, and all are conducted by the same
unerring laws of nature.

A survey of Nature, and the observation of her beautiful proportions,

<span id="page_52">p. 52</span>

first determined man to imitate the divine plan, and study symmetry and
order. This gave rise to Societies, and birth to every useful art. The
architect began to design, and the plans which he laid down, being
improved by experience and time, have produced works which are the
admiration of every age.

The lapse of time, the ruthless hand of ignorance, and the devastations
of war, have laid waste and destroyed many valuable monuments of
antiquity, on which the utmost exertions of human genius have been
employed. Even the Temple of Solomon, so spacious and magnificent, and
constructed by so many celebrated artists, escaped not the unsparing
ravages of barbarous force.

Freemasonry, notwithstanding, has still survived. The attentive ear
receives the sound from the instructive tongue, and the sacred mysteries
are safely lodged in the repository of faithful breasts.

Tools and implements of architecture, symbols the most expressive! are
selected by the Fraternity, to imprint on the memory wise and serious
truths; and thus, through a succession

<span id="page_53">p. 53</span>

of ages, are transmitted, unimpaired, the excellent tenets of our
institution.

### Corn, Wine and Oil

This closes the second section, and finishes the degree, with the
exception of the charge, which is as follows:

### Charge to the Candidate

My Brother: Being advanced to the degree of Fellow-Craft, we
congratulate you on your preferment. The internal and not the external
qualifications of a man are what Masonry regards. As you increase in
Masonic knowledge you will improve in social intercourse.

It is unnecessary to recapitulate the duties which, as a Fellow-Craft,
you are bound to discharge, or to enlarge on the importance of a strict
adherence to them, as your own experience must have established their
value.

The rules and regulations of a Fellow-Craft's Lodge you are strenuously
to support, and be always ready to assist in seeing them duly executed.
You are not to palliate or aggravate the offenses of your brethren; but,
in the decision of every trespass against our rules you are to judge
with candor,

<span id="page_54">p. 54</span>

admonish with friendship and reprehend with justice.

The study of the liberal arts and sciences, that valuable branch of
education which tends so effectually to polish and adorn the mind, is
earnestly recommended to your careful consideration; especially the
science of Geometry, which is established as the basis of our art.

Geometry, or Masonry (originally synonymous terms), being of a divine
and moral nature, is enriched with the most useful knowledge; while it
proves the wonderful properties of nature, it demonstrates the more
important truths of morality.

Your past behavior, and regular deportment, have merited the honor which
we have now conferred; and in your new character it is expected that you
will conform to the principles of our order, by steadily preserving in
the practice of every commendable virtue. Such is the nature of your
engagement as a Fellow-Craft, and to these duties you are bound by the
most sacred and solemn ties.
