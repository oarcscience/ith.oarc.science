<span id="page_120">p. 120</span>

The Grand Master says:

"R. W. G. S. Warden: The Grand Lodge of Texas having been invited to lay
the corner-stone of this edifice, and having assembled for that purpose,
I now order that this, the representation of the Grand Lodge of Texas,
do now assist me in the performance of this work. This my will and
pleasure you will, therefore, proclaim to the Grand Junior Warden, that
the brethren and others present may have due notice thereof."

The Grand Senior Warden says:

"Bro. Grand Junior Warden: It is the order of the M. W. G. Master that
the corner-stone be now laid with Masonic honors; this you will proclaim
to all present, that the occasion may be observed with due order and
solemnity."

The Grand Junior Warden then says:

"Brethren and all persons present will take notice that the M. W. G.
Master will now proceed to lay this corner-stone in due Masonic form.
You will, therefore, observe the order and decorum becoming the
important and

<span id="page_121">p. 121</span>

solemn ceremonies in which we are about to engage."

The Grand Master then says:

"R. W. G. Treasurer: I now order you to deposit the corn, medals and
papers in the place prepared for their reception."

The principal Architect then presents the working tools to the G.
Master, who directs the G. Marshal to present them to the Deputy G.
Master and Grand Senior and Junior Wardens.

The G. M., D. G. M., and G. Wardens then descend from the platform; the
G. M. with the Trowel, the D. G. Master with the Square, the G. S.
Warden with the Level, and the G. J. Warden With the Plumb--the G. M.
standing at the East of the stone, his Deputy on his right, the G. S.
Warden at the West and the G. J. Warden at the South side of the stone.
The Grand Master then spreads the cement, and when done, directs the G.
Marshal to order the Craftsmen to lower the stone by three motions.

The Public Grand Honors are then given. The Square, Level and Plumb are
then applied to the stone by the proper officers.

G. M.--R. W. D. G. Master: What is the proper Jewel of your office?

A.--The Square.

G. M.--Have you applied the Square to those parts of the stone that
should be squared?

<span id="page_122">p. 122</span>

A.--I have, M. W. G. M., and the Craftsmen have done their duty.

G. M.--R. W. G. S. Warden: What is the proper Jewel of your office?

A.--The Level.

G. M.--Have you applied the Level to the stone?

A.--I have, M. W. G. M., and the Craftsmen have done their duty.

G. M.--R. W. G. J. Warden: What is the proper Jewel of your office?

A.--The Plumb.

G. M.--Have you applied the Plumb to the several edges of the stone?

A.--I have, M. W. G. M., and the Craftsmen have done their duty.

G. M.--Having full confidence in your skill in the Royal Art, it remains
with me to finish the work.

The G. Master then gives three knocks upon the stone and says:

"I find this foundation-stone well formed, true and trusty, and may this
undertaking be conducted and completed by the Craftsmen, according to
the Grand Plan, in Peace, Love, and Harmony."

The D. G. M. then receives from the Grand Marshal the vessel containing
Corn, and, spreading the corn upon the stone, says:

<span id="page_123">p. 123</span>

"May the health of the workmen employed in this undertaking be preserved
to them, and the Supreme Grand Architect bless and prosper their
labors."

Response: So mote it be.

The G. S. Warden then receives from the Grand Marshal the vessel
containing Wine, and, pouring it upon the stone, says:

"May plenty be showered down upon the people of this State, and may the
blessing of the bounteous Giver of all things attend their philanthropic
undertakings."

Response: So mote it be.

The G. J. Warden then receives the vessel containing Oil, and pours it
upon the stone, saying:

"May the Supreme Ruler of the World preserve the people in peace, and
vouchsafe to them the enjoyment of every blessing."

G. M.--"May the Corn of nourishment, the Wine of refreshment, the Oil of
joy, and all the necessaries of life abound among men throughout the
world, and may the blessing of Almighty God be upon this undertaking,
and may this structure here to be

<span id="page_124">p. 124</span>

erected be preserved to the latest ages, in order that it may promote
the useful purposes for which it is designed."

Response: So mote it be.

The Grand Master then presents the implements to the Architect, saying:

"To you, Brother Architect, are confided the implements of operative
Masonry, with the fullest confidence that, by your skill and taste, a
fabric shall arise which shall add new luster to your fame as a Master
Builder; may it endure for many ages, a monument of the liberality and
benevolence of its founders."

Response: So mote it be.

An oration suitable to the occasion is then delivered. An ode sung, and
a prayer concludes the ceremonies; when the Lodge returns, in the same
form as above set out, to the place whence it came, and is closed in due
form.
