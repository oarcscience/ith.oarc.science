# MASTER MASON

\[Freemasonry, as before stated, is progressive, and a knowledge of its
philosophy and teachings can only be acquired by time, patience,
perseverance and close application.

In the first degree, we are taught the duties we owe to God, our
neighbor and ourselves.

In the second, we are more thoroughly inducted into the mysteries of
moral science and learn to trace the goodness and majesty of the
Creator, by minutely analyzing His works.

But the third degree cements the whole, and is calculated to bind men
together by mystic ties of fellowship, as in a bond of fraternal
affection and brotherly love.

It is among brethren of this degree that the Ancient Landmarks of the
Order are preserved, and it is from them the rulers of the Craft are
selected. It is in a Master's Lodge that all business of a legislative
character is transacted and all ballotings take place.\]

\[The candidate, after serving his proper time as a Fellow-Craft, orally
applies for the Master's degree; and, after being examined in a
Fellow-Craft's Lodge, as to his proficiency, a Master's Lodge is as
called to labor (it being a stated meeting), and the Lodge approving his
examination, a ballot is taken upon his application for the Third
degree; and if elected, and there be no objection, he is prepared for
his introduction into the first section of the Master's Degree.\]

<span id="page_56">p. 56</span>

\[This Degree is divided into three sections.\]

## SECTION I

\[During the ceremonies of this section the following passage of
Scripture is repeated:\]

"Remember now thy Creator in the days of thy youth, while the evil days
come not, nor the years draw nigh, when thou shalt say I have no
pleasure in them; while the sun or the light, or the moon, or the stars,
be not darkened, nor the clouds return after the rain; in the day when
the keeper of the house shall tremble, and the strong men shall bow
themselves, and the grinders cease, because they are few; and those that
look out of the windows be darkened, and the doors shall be shut in the
streets, when the sound of the grinding is low; and he shall rise up at
the voice of the bird, and all the daughters of music shall be brought
low. Also, when they shall be afraid of that which is high, and fears
shall be in the way, and the almond tree shall flourish, and the
grasshopper shall be a burden, and desire shall fail; because man goeth
to his long home,

<span id="page_57">p. 57</span>

and the mourners go about the streets; or ever the silver cord be
loosed, or the golden bowl be broken, or the pitcher be broken at the
fountain, or the wheel broken at the cistern. Then shall the dust return
to the earth as it was; and the spirit shall return unto God who gave
it."--Ecclesiastes 12:1-7.

\[The following hymn is occasionally introduced as a substitute for this
Scripture:\]

Music--BONNIE DOON

Let us remember in our youth,  
  Before the evil days draw nigh,  
Our great Creator, and His Truth!  
  Ere mem’ry fail, and pleasures fly;  
Or sun, or moon, or planet's light  
  Grow dark, or clouds return in gloom;  
Ere vital spark no more incite;  
  When strength shall bow and years consume.

Let us in youth remember him!  
  Who formed our frame and spirits gave,  
Ere windows of the mind grow dim.  
  Or door of speech obstructed wave:  
When voice of bird fresh terrors wake;  
  And music's daughters charm no more,  
Or fear to rise with [trembling](errata.htm#0.md) shake,  
  Along the path we travel o’er.

In youth, to God let memory cling,  
  Before desire shall fail or wane,  
Or e’er be loosed life's silver string,  
  Or bowl at fountain rent in twain; <span id="page_58">p. 58</span>  
For man to his long home doth go,  
  And mourners group around his urn;  
Our dust to dust again must flow,  
  And spirits unto God return.

This section closes with an explanation of

### The Working Tools of a Master Mason

They are all the implements of Masonry, indiscriminately, but more
especially the Trowel.

The Trowel is an instrument made use of by operative Masons to spread
the cement which unites a building in one common mass; but we, as Free
and Accepted Masons, are taught to make use of it for the more noble and
glorious purpose of spreading the cement of brotherly love and
affection; that cement which unites us into one sacred band, or society
of friends and brothers, among whom no contention should ever exist, but
that noble contention, or rather emulation, of who can best work and
best agree.

## SECTION II

\[This section, like the first, is altogether ceremonial, and recites a
legend of the utmost importance to the Order; and should be well
understood by all, and

<span id="page_59">p. 59</span>

forcibly and impressively illustrated at the raising of every Candidate,
as much depends upon the impression made upon him at the time he
receives the degree. In its symbolical interpretation, it testifies our
faith in the resurrection of the body and the immortality of the soul,
and places integrity and firmness upon a lofty pedestal in strong
contrast with those passions which debase and ruin those who indulge in
them.\]

### Funeral Dirge

Hymn, C. M.

Hark! from the tombs a doleful sound,  
  Mine ears attend the cry;  
Ye living men, come view the ground,  
  Where you must shortly lie.

Princes, this clay must be your bed,  
  In spite of all your towers;  
The tall, the wise, the reverend head,  
  Must lie as low as ours.

Great God, is this our certain doom?  
  And are we still secure?  
Still walking downward to the tomb,  
  And yet prepare no more?

Grant us the power of quick’ning grace,  
  To fit our souls to fly,  
That when we drop this dying flesh,  
  We'll rise above the sky.

Or, if preferred, the following may be used:

<span id="page_60">p. 60</span>

### Funeral Dirge

Music--PLEYEL'S HYMN

Solemn strikes the fun’ral chime,  
  Notes of our departing time;  
As we journey here below,  
  Thro’ a pilgrimage of woe.

Mortals, now indulge a tear,  
  For Mortality is here!  
See how wide her trophies wave  
  O’er the slumbers of the grave!

Here another guest we bring;  
  Seraphs of celestial wing,  
To our fun’ral altar come,  
  Waft our friend and brother home.

There, enlarged, thy soul shall see  
  What was veiled in mystery;  
Heavenly glories of the place  
  Show his Maker face to face.

Lord of all! below--above--  
  Fill our hearts with truth and love;  
When dissolves our earthly tie,  
  Take us to Thy Lodge on high.

\[The following prayer is offered just before the candidate is raised:\]

### Prayer

Thou, O God, knowest our down-sitting and our uprising, and
understandest our thoughts afar off. Shield and defend us from the evil
intentions of our enemies, and support us under

<span id="page_61">p. 61</span>

the trials and afflictions we are destined to endure while traveling
through this vale of tears. Man that is born of a woman is of few days
and full of trouble. He cometh forth as a flower and is cut down; he
fleeth also as a shadow, and continueth not. Seeing his days are
determined, the number of his months are with Thee; Thou hast appointed
his bounds that he cannot pass; turn from him that he may rest till he
shall accomplish his day.

For there is hope of a tree, if it be cut down, that it will sprout
again, and that the tender branch thereof will not cease. But man dieth
and wasteth away; yea, man giveth up the ghost, and where is he? As the
waters fail from the sea, and the flood decayeth and drieth up, so man
lieth down and riseth not up till the heavens shall be no more. Yet, O
Lord! have compassion on the children of Thy creation; administer them
comfort in time of trouble, and save them with an everlasting salvation!
Amen.

Response: So mote it be.

## SECTION III

\[The third section explains the various classes of emblems belonging to
this degree,

<span id="page_62">p. 62</span>

and is principally all monitorial.\]

The third section sets out--

The three steps usually delineated on the Master's Carpet are
emblematical of the three principal stages of human life, namely: Youth,
Manhood and Old Age.

\[In Youth, as Entered Apprentices, we ought to occupy our minds in the
attainment of useful knowledge; in Manhood, as Fellow-Crafts, we should
apply our knowledge to the discharge of our duties to God, our neighbor
and ourselves, so that, in Old Age, as Master Masons, we may enjoy the
happy reflection consequent upon a well-spent life, and die in the hope
of a glorious immortality.\]

### The Pot of Incense

Is an emblem of a pure heart, which is always an acceptable sacrifice to
the Deity; and, as this glows with fervent heat, so should our hearts
continually glow with gratitude to the great beneficent Author of our
existence for the manifold blessings and comforts we enjoy.

### The Bee Hive

Is an emblem of industry, and recommends the practice of that virtue to
all created beings, from the highest

<span id="page_63">p. 63</span>

seraph in heaven to the lowest reptile of the dust. It teaches us that,
as we came into the world endowed as rational and intelligent beings, so
we should ever be industrious ones; never sitting down contented while
our fellow creatures around us are in want, when it is in our power to
relieve them, without inconvenience to ourselves.

When we take a survey of nature, we view man in his infancy, more
helpless and indigent than the brute creation; he lies languishing for
days, months and years, totally incapable of providing sustenance for
himself, or guarding against the attack of the wild beasts of the field,
or sheltering himself from the inclemencies of the weather.

It might have pleased the great Creator of heaven and earth to have made
man independent of all other beings; but, as dependence is one of the
strongest bonds of society, mankind were made dependent upon each other
for protection and security, as they thereby enjoy better opportunities
of fulfilling the duties of reciprocal love and friendship. Thus was man
formed for social and active life;

<span id="page_64">p. 64</span>

the noblest part of the work of God; and he that will so demean himself
as not to be endeavoring to add to the common stock of knowledge and
understanding, may be deemed a drone in the hive of nature, a useless
member of society, and unworthy of our protection as Masons.

### The Book of Constitutions, Guarded by the Tiler's Sword

Reminds us that we should be ever watchful and guarded in our thoughts,
words and actions, particularly when before the enemies of Masonry; ever
bearing in remembrance those truly Masonic virtues, silence and
circumspection.

### The Sword Pointing to a Naked Heart

Demonstrates that justice will sooner or later overtake us; and although
our thoughts, words and actions may be hidden from the eyes of man, yet
that

**All-Seeing Eye**

\[paragraph continues\] Whom the sun, moon and stars obey, and under
whose watchful care even comets perform their stupendous revolutions,

<span id="page_65">p. 65</span>

pervades the inmost recesses of the human heart, and will reward us
according to our merits.

### The Anchor and Ark

Are emblems of a well-grounded hope, and a well-spent life. They are
emblematical of that divine ark which safely wafts us over this
tempestuous sea of troubles, and that anchor which shall safely moor us
in a peaceful harbor, where the wicked cease from troubling and the
weary shall find rest.

### The Forty-Seventh Problem of Euclid

This was an invention of the ancient philosopher, the great Pythagoras,
who, in his travels through Asia, Africa and Europe, was initiated in
several orders of Priesthood, and is said to have been raised to the
sublime degree of Master Mason. This wise philosopher enriched his mind
abundantly in a general knowledge of things, and more especially in
Geometry or Masonry. On this subject he drew out many problems and
theorems and among the most distinguished he erected this, which, in the
joy of his heart, he called Eureka, in the Grecian

<span id="page_66">p. 66</span>

language, signifying I have found it; and upon the discovery of which he
is said to have sacrificed a hecatomb. It teaches Masons to be general
lovers of the arts and sciences.

### The Hour Glass

Is an emblem of human life. Behold! how swiftly and rapidly our lives
are drawing to a close. We cannot, without astonishment, behold the
little particles, which are contained in this machine, how they pass
away almost imperceptibly, and yet, to our surprise, in the short space
of an hour, they are all exhausted. Thus wastes man! today he puts forth
the tender leaves of hope; tomorrow, blossoms and bears his blushing
honors thick upon him; the next day comes a frost, which nips the shoot,
and when he thinks his greatness is still aspiring, he falls, like
autumn leaves, to enrich our mother earth.

### The Scythe

Is an emblem of time, which cuts the brittle thread of life and launches
us into eternity. Behold! what havoc the scythe of Time makes among the
human race; if, by chance, we should

<span id="page_67">p. 67</span>

escape the numerous evils incident to childhood and youth, and with
health and vigor arrive to the years of manhood; yet, withal, we must
soon be cut down by the all-devouring scythe of Time, and be gathered
into the land where our fathers have gone before us.

### The Ninth, or Last Class of Emblems

Thus we close the explanations of this degree with the solemn thought of
death, which, without Revelation, is dark and gloomy; but the good Mason
is suddenly revived by the ever-green and ever living sprig of Faith in
the merits of the Lion of the tribe of Judah; which strengthens him with
confidence and composure, to look forward to a blessed immortality; and
doubts not, but in the glorious morn of the resurrection, his body will
rise and become as incorruptible as his soul.

Then let us imitate our ancient patron in his virtuous and amiable
conduct; in his unfeigned piety to God; in his inflexible fidelity to
his trust; that we may welcome the grim tyrant Death, receiving him as a
kind Messenger sent from our Supreme Grand

<span id="page_68">p. 68</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Master, to translate us from this imperfect to
that all-perfect, glorious and celestial Lodge above, where the Supreme
Architect of the Universe presides.

This closes the Third Section, and finishes the degree, except the
charge, which is as follows:

### Charge

My Brother: Your zeal for our institution, the progress you have made in
our mysteries, and your steady conformity to our useful regulations,
have pointed you out as a proper object for this peculiar mark of our
favor.

Duty and honor now alike bind you to be faithful to every trust, to
support the dignity of your character on all occasions, and strenuously
to enforce, by precept and example, a steady obedience to the tenets of
Freemasonry.

Exemplary conduct on your part will convince the world that merit is the
just title to our privileges, and that on you our favors have not been
undeservedly bestowed. In this respectable character, you are authorized
to correct the irregularities of your less informed brethren; to fortify

<span id="page_69">p. 69</span>

their minds with resolution against the snares of the insiduous, and to
guard them against every allurement to vicious practices.

To preserve unsullied the reputation of the Fraternity, ought to be your
constant care; and, therefore, it becomes your province to caution the
inexperienced against a breach of fidelity.

To your inferiors in rank or office you are to recommend obedience and
submission; to your equals, courtesy and affability; to your superiors,
kindness and condescension. Universal benevolence you are zealously to
inculcate; and by the regularity of your own conduct, endeavor to remove
every aspersion against this venerable institution.

Our Ancient Landmarks you are carefully to preserve, and not suffer
them, on any pretense, to be infringed, or countenance a deviation from
our established customs.

Your honor and reputation are concerned in supporting, with dignity, the
respectable character you now bear. Let no motive, therefore, make you
swerve from your duty, violate your vows, or betray your trust; but be

<span id="page_70">p. 70</span>

true and faithful, and imitate the example of that celebrated artist,
whom you have this evening represented.

Thus you will render yourself deserving of the honor which we have
conferred, and worthy of the confidence we have reposed in you.
