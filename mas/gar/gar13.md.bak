### DEGREE OF ENTERED APPRENTICE.

#### Symbolism of the Degree.

THE first, or Entered Apprentice degree of Masonry, is intended,
symbolically, to represent the entrance of man into the world, in which
he is afterwards to become a living and thinking actor. Coming from the
ignorance and darkness of the outer world, his first craving is for
light—not that physical light which springs from the great orb of day as
its fountain, but that moral and intellectual light which emanates from
the primal Source of all things—from the Grand Architect of the
Universe—the Creator of the sun and of alt that it illuminates. Hence
the great, the primary object of the first degree, is to symbolize that
birth of intellectual light into the mind; and the Entered Apprentice is
the type of unregenerate man, groping in moral and mental darkness, and
seeking for the light which is to guide his steps and point him to the
path which leads to duty and to Him who gives to duty its reward.

### FIRST LECTURE.

THE first step taken by a candidate, on entering a Lodge of Freemasons,
teaches him the pernicious tendency of infidelity, and shows him that
the foundation on which Masonry rests is the belief and acknowledgment
of a Supreme Being; that in Him alone a sure confidence can be safely
placed, to protect his steps in all the dangers and difficulties he may

<span id="page_52">p. 52</span>

be called to encounter in his progress through life; it assures him
that, if his faith be well founded in that Being, he may confidently
pursue his course without fear and without danger.

Every candidate, previous to his reception, is required to give his free
and full assent to the following interrogatories, in a room adjacent to
the Lodge:

1\. Do you seriously declare, upon your honor, that, unbiased by the
improper solicitation of friends, and uninfluenced by mercenary motives,
you freely and voluntarily offer yourself a can-date for the mysteries
of Freemasonry?

2\. Do you seriously declare, upon your honor, that you are prompted to
solicit the privileges of Freemasonry by a favorable opinion conceived
of the institution, a desire of knowledge, and a sincere wish of being
serviceable to your fellow-creatures?

3\. Do you seriously declare, upon your honor, that you will cheerfully
conform to all the ancient usages and established customs of the
Fraternity?

### SECTION I.

MASONRY was originally an operative society, and in that form those who
worked as ENTERED APPRENTICES were styled the *first class;* but in
Speculative or Freemasonry, the degree of which we are now treating is
regarded as the first of the Order. Its reception places the novitiate
in possession of

<span id="page_53">p. 53</span>

the Masonic alphabet, and discloses to him the fundamental principles of
this time-honored institution. This section is sub-divided under three
heads, viz:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

1st. THE CEREMONY;

2d. ITS MORAL; and

3d. ITS NECESSITY and CONSISTENCY.

</div>

A full and perfect knowledge of this section is indispensably necessary
to every Mason who would be serviceable to the institution, and would
avail himself of its privileges and its enjoyments.

THE ENTRANCE.—The preparations to which the candidate must submit,
before entering the Lodge, serve allegorically to teach him, as well as
to remind the brethren who are present, that it is the man alone,
divested of all the outward recommendations of rank, state, or of
riches, which Masonry accepts, and that it is his spiritual, or moral
worth alone, which can open for him the door of the temple.

As Masons, we are taught never to commence any great or important
undertaking, without first invoking the blessing of Deity.

The trust of a Mason is in God, as a basis which can never fail, and a
rock which can never be shaken. Nor is it a mere empty profession; for
it is borne out and illustrated by our practice. We open and close our
Lodges with prayer; the same formula is used at the initiation of
candidates; and no business of any importance is conducted without
invoking the Divine assistance on our labors; and the blessing of God
cannot be expected to follow any man's profession, unless it be verified
by a good and virtuous life.
