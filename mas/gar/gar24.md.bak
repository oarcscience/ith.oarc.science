### Where Held.

Lodge meetings, at the present day, are usually held in upper
chambers—probably for the better security which such places afford. It
may be, however, that the custom had its origin in a practice observed
by the ancient Jews, of building their temples, schools, and synagogues
on high hills, <span id="fr_10"></span>[\*](#fn_10.md) a practice which
seems to have met the approbation of the ALMIGHTY, who said unto the
Prophet EZEKIEL, "Upon the top of the mountain, the whole limit thereof,
round about shall be most holy." Before the erection of temples, the
*celestial* bodies were worshiped on HILLS, and the *terrestrial* ones
in VALLEYS. <span id="fr_11"></span>[†](#fn_11.md) At a later period, the
Christians, wherever it was practicable, erected their churches on
eminences.

Hills or mountains were always considered the peculiar abode of the
Deity; and hence the Masonic tradition, that our ancient brethren held
their Lodges most frequently on the highest of hills. The veneration for
hills or secret caverns induced the construction of temples for divine
worship in such situations. The custom was

<span id="page_76">p. 76</span>

initiated in the early ages of Christianity; for our ancient churches
are usually erected on hills, and, beneath the foundations of those
which are cathedral or collegiate, crypts were commonly constructed for
private devotion and other secret purposes.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_10"></span>[75:\*](gar24.htm#fr_10.md) The Noachidæ met on the
summit of high hills, to practice their simple devotions, which were
commemorative of their preservation amidst the destruction of mankind by
the Universal Deluge, and of the promise that the world should never
again be subjected to a similar judgment.

<span id="fn_11"></span>[75:†](gar24.htm#fr_11.md) In imitation of the
primitive practice, but with a much more innocent purpose than the
worship of idols, before Freemasons possessed the convenience of
well-formed Lodges, our ancient brethren used to assemble on the highest
of hills or in the lowest of valleys, because such situations afforded
the means of security from unlawful intrusion.
