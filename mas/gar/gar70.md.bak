#### SERVICE AT THE GRAVE.

When the solemn rites of the dead are to be performed at the grave, the
procession should be formed, and proceed to the place of interment in
the following order:

Tiler, with drawn sword;

Stewards, with white rods;

Musicians,  
If they are Masons, otherwise they follow the Tiler;

<span id="img_32900"></span> ![Master Masons;&lt;br&gt; Secretary and
Treasurer;&lt;br&gt; Senior and Junior Wardens;&lt;br&gt; Past
Masters;](img/32900.jpg.md)

The Holy Writings,  
On a cushion, covered with black cloth, carried by the oldest member of
the Lodge;

THE MASTER,  
Supported by two Deacons, with white rods;

Officiating Clergy;

<span id="img_32901"></span> ![The Body&lt;br&gt; with the insignia
placed thereon;&lt;br&gt; Pall-bearers; Pall-bearers;&lt;br&gt;
Mourners.](img/32901.jpg.md)

If the deceased was a member of a Royal Arch Chapter and a Commandery of
Knights Templar, and members of those bodies should unite in the
procession, clothed as such, the former will follow the Past Masters,
and the latter will act as an escort or guard of honor to the corpse,
outside the Pall-bearers, marching in the form of

<span id="page_330">p. 330</span>

a triangle; the officers of the Commandery forming the base of the
triangle, with the Eminent Commander in the center.

When the procession has arrived at the place of interment, the members
of the Lodge should form a circle around the grave; when the Master,
Chaplain, and other Officers of the acting Lodge, take their position at
the head of the grave, and the mourners at the foot.

After the Clergyman has performed the religious service of the Church,
the Masonic service should begin.

<span id="img_33000"></span> ![](img/33000.jpg)

THE Chaplain rehearses the following or some other appropriate PRAYER:

ALMIGHTY and most merciful Father, we adore thee as the God of time and
eternity. As it has pleased thee to take from the light of our abode one
dear to our hearts, we beseech thee to bless and sanctify unto us this
dispensation of thy providence. Inspire our hearts with wisdom from on
high, that we may glorify thee in all our ways. May we realize that
thine all-seeing eye is upon us, and be influenced by the

<span id="page_331">p. 331</span>

spirit of truth and love to perfect obedience—that we may enjoy the
divine approbation here below. And when our toils on earth shall have
ended, may we be raised to the enjoyment of fadeless light and immortal
life in that kingdom where faith and hope shall end—and love and joy
prevail through eternal ages. And thine, O righteous Father, shall be
the glory forever.—AMEN.

*Response*.—So mote it be.

The following exhortation is then given by the Master:

BRETHREN: The solemn notes that betoken the dissolution of this earthly
tabernacle, have again alarmed our outer door, and another spirit has
been summoned to the land where our fathers have gone before us. Again
we are called to assemble among the habitations of the dead, to behold
the "narrow house appointed for all living." Here, around us, in that
peace which the world cannot give or take away, sleep the unnumbered
dead. The gentle breeze fans their verdant covering, they heed it not;
the sunshine and the storm pass over them, and they are not disturbed;
stones and lettered monuments symbolize the affection of surviving

<span id="page_332">p. 332</span>

friends, yet no sound proceeds from them, save that silent but thrilling
admonition, "Seek ye the narrow path and the straight gate that lead
unto eternal life."

We are again called upon to consider the uncertainty of human life; the
immutable certainty of death, and the vanity of all human pursuits.
Decrepitude and decay are written upon every living thing. The cradle
and the coffin stand in juxtaposition to each other; and it is a
melancholy truth, that so soon as we begin to live, that moment also we
begin to die. It is passing strange that, notwithstanding the daily
mementos of mortality that cross our path; notwithstanding the funeral
bell so often tolls in our ears, and the "mournful procession" go about
our streets, that we will not more seriously consider our approaching
fate. We go on from design to design, add hope to hope, and lay out
plans for the employment of many years, until we are suddenly alarmed at
the approach of the Messenger of Death, at a moment when we least expect
him, and which we probably conclude to be the meridian of our existence.

What, then, are all the externals of human dignity, the power of wealth,
the dreams of

<span id="page_333">p. 333</span>

ambition, the pride of intellect, or the charms of beauty, when Nature
has paid her just debt? Fix your eyes on the last sad scene, and view
life stript of its ornaments, and exposed in its natural meanness, and
you must be persuaded of the utter emptiness of these delusions. In the
grave, all fallacies are detected, all ranks are leveled, all
distinctions are done away. Here the scepter of the prince and the staff
of the beggar are laid side by side.

While we drop the sympathetic tear over the grave of our deceased
brother, let us cast around his foibles, whatever they may have been,
the *broad mantle of Masonic charity*, nor withhold from his memory the
commendation that his virtues claim at our hands. Perfection on earth
has never yet been attained; the wisest, as well as the best of men,
have gone astray. Suffer, then, the apologies of human nature to plead
for him who can no longer plead for himself.

Our present meeting and procedings will have been vain and useless, if
they fail to excite our serious reflections, and strengthen our
resolutions of amendment.. Be then persuaded, my brethren, by this
example, of the uncertainty of human life—of the unsubstantial nature of

<span id="page_334">p. 334</span>

all its pursuits, and no longer postpone the all-important concern of
preparing for eternity. Let us each embrace the present moment, and
while time and opportunity permit, prepare with care for that great
change, which we all know must come, when the pleasures of the world
shall cease to delight, and be as a poison to our lips; and while we may
enjoy the happy reflection of a well-spent life in the exercise of piety
and virtue, will yield the only comfort and consolation. Thus shall our
hopes be not frustrated, nor we hurried unprepared into the presence of
that all-wise and powerful Judge, to whom the secrets of all hearts are
known. Let us resolve to maintain with sincerity the dignified character
of our profession. May our *faith* be evinced in a correct moral walk
and deportment; may our *hope* be bright as the glorious mysteries that
will be revealed hereafter; and our *charity* boundless as the wants of
our fellow-creatures. And having faithfully discharged the great duties
which we owe to GOD, to our neighbor, and ourselves; when at last it
shall please the Grand Master of the universe to summon us into his
eternal presence, may the *trestle-board* of our whole lives

<span id="page_335">p. 335</span>

pass such inspection that it may be given unto each of us to "eat of the
hidden manna," and to receive the "white stone with a new name," that
will insure perpetual and unspeakable happiness at his right hand.

The Master then (presenting the apron) continues:

The lambskin, or white apron, is the emblem of innocence and the badge
of a Mason. It is more ancient than the Golden Fleece or Roman Eagle;
more honorable than the Star and Garter, when worthily worn.

The Master then deposits it in the grave.

This emblem I now deposit in the grave of our deceased brother. By it we
are reminded of the universal dominion of Death. The arm of Friendship
cannot interpose to prevent his coming; the wealth of the world cannot
purchase our release; nor will the innocence of youth, or the charms of
beauty propitiate his purpose. The mattock, the coffin, and the
melancholy grave, admonish, us of our mortality, and that, sooner or
later, these frail bodies must moulder in their parent dust.

The Master (holding the evergreen) continues:

<span id="page_336">p. 336</span>

This *evergreen*, which once marked the temporary resting-place of the
illustrious dead, is an emblem of our faith in the immortality of the
soul. By this we are reminded that we have an immortal part within us,
that shall survive the grave, and which shall never, *never*, NEVER,
die. By it we are admonished that, though, like our brother, whose
remains lie before us, we shall soon be clothed in the habiliments of
DEATH, and deposited in the silent tomb, yet, through our belief inn the
mercy of GOD, we may confidently hope that our souls will bloom in
eternal spring. This, too, I deposit in the grave, with the exclamation,
"Alas, my brother!"

The brethren then move in procession around the place of interment, and
severally drop the sprig of evergreen into the grave; after which, the
public grand honors <span id="fr_42"></span>[\*](#fn_42.md) are given.

<span id="page_337">p. 337</span>

The Master then continues the ceremony:

From time immemorial, it has been the custom among the Fraternity of
Free and Accepted Masons, at the request of a brother, to accompany his
remains to the place of interment, and there to deposit them with the
usual formalities.

In conformity to this usage, and at the request of our deceased brother,
whose memory we revere, and whose loss we now deplore, we have assembled
in the character of Masons, to offer up to his memory, before the world,
the last tribute of our affection; thereby demonstrating the sincerity
of our past esteem for him, and our steady attachment to the principles
of the Order.

The Great Creator having been pleased, out of his infinite mercy, to
remove our brother from the cares and troubles of this transitory
existence, to a state of endless duration, thus severing another link
from the fraternal chain that binds us together; may we, who survive
him, be more strongly cemented in the ties of union and friendship;
that, during the short space allotted us here, we may wisely and
usefully employ our time; and in the reciprocal intercourse of kind and
friendly acts, mutually promote the welfare

<span id="page_338">p. 338</span>

and happiness of each other. Unto the grave we have consigned the body
of our deceased brother; earth to earth (*earth being sprinkled on the
coffin*), ashes to ashes, (*more earth*), dust to dust, (*more earth*);
there to remain till the trump shall sound on the resurrection morn. We
can cheerfully leave him in the hands of a Being, who has done all
things well; who is glorious in holiness, fearful in praises, doing
wonders.

To those of his immediate relatives and friends, who are most
heart-stricken at the loss we have all sustained, we have but little of
this world's consolation to offer. We can only sincerely, deeply, and
most affectionately sympathize with them in their afflictive
bereavement. But we can say, that HE who tempers the wind to the shorn
lamb, looks down With infinite compassion upon the widow and fatherless,
in the hour of their desolation; and that the Great Architect will fold
the arms of his love and protection around those who put their trust in
him.

Then let us improve this solemn warning that at last, when the sheeted
dead are stirring, when the great white throne is set, we shall receive
from the Omniscient Judge, the thrilling invitation,

<span id="page_339">p. 339</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Come, ye blessed,
inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.

The following, or some other suitable ODE, may be sung:

The service may be concluded with the following or some other suitable
PRAYER:

MOST GLORIOUS GOD, author of all good and giver of all mercy, pour down
thy blessings upon us and strengthen our solemn engagements with the
ties of sincere affection. May the present instance of mortality remind
us of our own approaching fate, and, by drawing our attention toward
thee, the only refuge in time of need, may we be induced so to regulate
our conduct here, that when the awful moment

<span id="page_343">p. 343</span>

shall arrive, at which we must quit this transitory scene, the
enlivening prospect of thy mercy may dispel the gloom of death; and that
after our departure hence in peace and thy favor, we may be received
into thine everlasting kingdom, and there join in union with our friend,
and enjoy that uninterrupted and unceasing felicity which is allotted to
the souls of just men made perfect.—AMEN.

*Response*. So mote it be.

*Master*. The will of God is accomplished.

*Response*. So mote it be.

*Master*. From dust we came, and unto dust we must return.

*Response*. May we all be recompensed at the resurrection of the
just.—AMEN.

Thus the service ends, and the procession will return in form to the
place whence it set out, where the necessary business of Masonry should
be renewed. The insignia and ornaments of the deceased, if an officer of
a Lodge, are to be returned to the Master, with the usual ceremonies,
and the Lodge will be closed in form.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_42"></span>[336:\*](gar70.htm#fr_42.md) The grand honors
practiced among Masons during the burial ceremonies, either in public or
private, are given in the following manner: Both arms are crossed on the
breast, the left uppermost, and the open palms of the hands striking the
shoulders; they are then raised above the head, the palms striking each
other, and then made to fall sharply on the thighs, with the head bowed.
This is repeated three times. While the honors are being given the third
time, the brethren audibly pronounce the following words—when the arms
are crossed on the breast:—"we cherish his memory here;" when the hands
are extended above the head—"We commend his spirit to Goa who gave it;"
and when the hands are extended toward the ground—"And consign his body
to the earth."
