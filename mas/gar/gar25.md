### Form and Dimensions of the Lodge.

Its form is \* \* \* \*. Its dimensions, from east to west, embracing
every clime between north and south. In fact, its universal chain of
friendship encircles every portion of the human family, and beams
wherever civilization extends.

The form of a Lodge should always be an oblong square, in length,
between the east and the west; in breadth, between the north and the
south; in height, from earth to heaven; and in depth, from the surface
to the center. This disposition serves to indicate the prevalence of
Freemasonry over the whole face of the globe, guarded by its laws, and
ornamented by its beautiful tenets. Every civilized region is
illuminated by its presence. Its charity relieves the wretched; its
brotherly love unites the Fraternity in a chain of indissoluble
affection, and extends its example beyond the limits of the lodge-room,
to embrace, in its ample scope, the whole human race, infolding them in
its arms of universal love. The square form was esteemed by our ancient
operative brethren as one of the Greater Lights, and a component part of
the furniture of the Lodge. The double cube is an expressive emblem of
the united powers of darkness and light in the creation.

### The Boundaries of the Lodge.

The Masonic Lodge, bounded only by the extreme points of the compass,
the highest heavens, and the lowest depth of the central abyss, is
metaphorically supported by three great pillars,

<span id="page_77">p. 77</span>

which are denominated WISDOM, <span id="fr_12"></span>[\*](#fn_12.md)
STRENGTH, <span id="fr_13"></span>[†](#fn_13.md) and BEAUTY: <span
id="fr_14"></span>[‡](#fn_14.md) because there should be *wisdom* to
contrive, *strength* to support, and *beauty* to adorn all great and
important undertakings. The universe is the temple of the DEITY whom we
serve: Wisdom, Strength, and Beauty are about His throne as pillars of
His work; for His wisdom is infinite, His strength is omnipotent, and
His beauty shines forth through all His creation in symmetry and order.

As the work of building the temple at Jerusalem was conducted by the
wisdom of SOLOMON, the strength of Mutant, king of Tyre, and the beauty,
or cunning workmanship of HIRAM ABIFF, so the labors of the Lodge are
supported by the wisdom, strength, and beauty of the three
presiding-officers, who occupy the prominent stations in the East, West,
and South; thus locally forming a triangle,

<span id="page_78">p. 78</span>

which is a sacred emblem, and unitedly constituting one chief governor,
by which the affairs of the Lodge are conducted, and without the
presence of all three, or their legally-appointed representatives, no
Lodge can be opened for the transaction of business, nor can any
candidate be legally initiated therein.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_12"></span>[77:\*](gar25.htm#fr_12.md) WISDOM is represented
by the Ionic column and the W. M.; because the Ionic column wisely
combines the strength without the massiveness of the Doric; with the
grace, without the exuberance of ornament, of the Corinthian; and
because it is the duty of the W. M. to superintend, instruct, and
enlighten the Craft by his superior wisdom. SOLOMON, king of Israel, is
also considered as the column of wisdom that supported the temple.

<span id="fn_13"></span>[77:†](gar25.htm#fr_13.md) STRENGTH is represented
by the Doric column and the S. W.; because the Doric is the strongest
and most massive of the Orders, and because it is the duty of the S. W.,
by an attentive superintendence of the Craft, to aid the W. M. in the
performance of his duties, and to strengthen and support his authority.
HIRAM, king of Tyre, is also considered as the representative of the
column of strength which supported the temple.

<span id="fn_14"></span>[77:‡](gar25.htm#fr_14.md) BEAUTY is represented by
the Corinthian column and the J. W,; because the Corinthian is the most
beautiful and highly finished of the Orders, and because the situation
of the J. W. in the S. enables him the better to observe that bright
luminary which, at its meridian height, is the beauty and glory of the
day.—Thus, by the united energies of these three presiding-officers, the
system is adorned and established firm as a rock in mid-ocean, braving
the malignant shafts of envy and detraction; its summit gilded with the
rays of the meridian sun, though stormy winds and waves beat furiously
on its base.
