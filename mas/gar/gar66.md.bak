#### GRAND VISITATIONS.

THE Grand Master, accompanied by the Grand Officers, should, at least
once a year, or as often as he may deem expedient, visit the Lodges
under his jurisdiction, to make the customary examinations. When this
laudable duty becomes impracticable, from the extent of jurisdiction and
large number of Lodges, the Grand Master may appoint any one or more of
his Grand Officers, who shall visit and inspect such Lodges as the Grand
Master shall designate, and make report to him of the result.

The following is the ceremony observed on such occasions:

The Grand Secretary, by command of the Grand Master or Presiding Grand
Officer, notifies the Lodge of the intended visit.

The Master opens his Lodge in the third degree, and places his Deacons
at the sides of the door, with their staves crossed. The Brethren
arrange themselves in a line from the door, on each side, to the Chair.
The orders, borne by some of the most respectable private Brethren, wait
near the door, to walk before the Grand Master when they enter. This
being arranged in this manner, the Master deputes a Past Master to
escort the Grand Officers, who enter in the following form:

Grand Marshal;

Grand Stewards;

Grand Pursuivant, with sword;

Two Grand Deacons;

Grand Treasurer and Secretary;

Grand Chaplain;
