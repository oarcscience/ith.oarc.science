### THE OBLIGATION OF SECRECY.

ONE of the most notable features of Freemasonry—one, certainly, which
attracts, more than any thing else, the attention of the profane
world—is that vail of mystery—that awful secrecy—behind which it moves
and acts. From the earliest periods, this has invariably been a
distinctive characteristic of the institution; and to-day, as of old,
the first obligation of a Mason—his supreme duty—is that of silence and
secrecy. Why is this? Why did Freemasonry, in the beginning, adopt the
principle of secrecy, as a vital one? and why has it so persistently
adhered to it, through all the changes that have swept over the earth,
and transformed all things else?

The enemies of Freemasonry, like THOMAS PAINE and others, pretend that
they have found the origin of Masonic secrecy in the fact that the
esoteric doctrines of the Order were antagonistic to the prevailing
opinions, and therefore could not safely be professed before the world.
Hence, according to them, the retiring into silence and secrecy was
simply an act of cowardice, to escape the danger that might follow the
open and honest promulgation of an unpopular doctrine! Some
distinguished Masonic writers have also—strange as it may
appear—professed the same theory. We must nevertheless pronounce it an
exceedingly shallow and unphilosophical one. The obligation of secrecy
does not owe its origin to any such cause. That origin must be found,
and can only be found, in the *intrinsic value and divine excellence of
the principle of secrecy itself*. Among the ancients, silence and
secrecy were considered virtues of the highest order. The Egyptians
worshiped Harpocrates, the

<span id="page_62">p. 62</span>

god of secrecy, raised altars in his name, and wreathed them with
garlands of flowers. Among the ancient Romans, too, these virtues were
not less esteemed; and a distinguished Latin poet tells us, "*Est* *et
fideli tuta silentio merces:*"—"for faithful silence, also, there is a
sure reward."

Mystery has charms for all men, and is closely allied to the spiritual
part of man's nature. The entire fabric of the universe is founded on
secrecy; and the great Life-force which vivifies, moves, and beautifies
the whole, is the profoundest of all mysteries. We cannot, indeed, fix
our eyes on a single point in creation which does not shade off into
mystery, and touch the realms of Eternal Silence. As the fathers of
Freemasonry discovered that all life and beauty were elaborated in Night
and Mystery, they made the Institution, in this respect, conform to the
divine order of Nature. In the Pythagorean Freemasonry, silence and
secrecy were religious duties, and held to be the most fruitful sources
of intellectual and moral improvement. A distinguished modern
writer <span id="fr_5"></span>[\*](#fn_5.md) repeats the same idea in
quaint but forcible language:—"Thoughts will not work, except in
silence; neither will virtue work, except in secrecy: Like other plants,
virtue will not grow, unless its roots be hidden, buried from the light
of the sun. Let the sun shine on it—nay, do but look at it privily
thyself—the root withers, and no flowers will glad thee."

In the grand mythology of ancient Scandinavia, there is a remarkable
myth, called the Yggdrasil-Tree, or Ever-blooming Ash, whose top rose to
the highest heavens, and whose roots struck down through the regions of
everlasting gloom and night. From age to age, its branches, loaded with
benedictions, spread out over all worlds, the delight of gods and men,
diffusing life and beauty and fragrance through the universe. And all
this glory, and these capabilities to bless, were the fruit of the
mysterious and secret labors of the sacred Nornas, who perpetually
watered its roots from the deep-hidden wells, and thus preserved its
vigor and vitality.

The Yggdrasil-Tree is a beautiful symbolical representation of
Freemasonry, and illustrates well the character of Masonic secrecy. Like
that tree, in the youth of Humanity, the Mystic Order arose among the
nations of the earth, and its ever-green branches spread over the world;
and, by the vital power of its secret ministry, it diffused order, and
beauty, and virtue, and civilization over all lands.

<span id="page_63">p. 63</span>

Another reason why Freemasonry regards secrecy as a fundamental
principle is, because a unity, harmony, and strength can be secured
thereby, which cannot be obtained in any other way. Secrecy has a
mystic, binding, almost supernatural force, and unites men more closely
together than all other means combined. The common possession of a
secret by a considerable number of people, produces a family-feeling.
There is something profoundly mystical in this, no doubt; but it is,
nevertheless, a fact. Suppose two men, strangers, traveling in a distant
country, should by some accident be brought together for a few brief
moments, during which they happen to be the involuntary witnesses of
some terrible deed, a deed which circumstances demand shall remain a
secret between them for ever. In all the wide world, only these two men,
and they strangers to each other, know the secret. They separate;
continents and oceans, and many eventful years, divide them; but they
cannot forget each other, nor the dread mystery which binds them
together as with an iron chain. Neither time nor distance can weaken
that mighty bond. In that, they are *for ever one*.

It is not, then, for any vain or frivolous purpose that Masonry appeals
to the principle of secrecy, but, rather, because it creates a
family-feeling, insures unity, and throws the charm of mystery and
poetry around the Order, making its labors easy and its obligations
pleasant.

IN the beginning, God created the heaven and the earth. And the earth
was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep.
And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters. And God said,
Let there be light. and there was light.

\*       \*       \*       \*       \*       \*       \*

Light is one of the requirements of a candidate at his initiation; and
the material light which is afforded him is succeeded by an intellectual
illumination, which serves to enlighten his path on the journey from
this world to the next.
