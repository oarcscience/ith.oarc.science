CHARITY is the chief of every social virtue, and the distinguishing
characteristic of Masons. This virtue includes a supreme degree of love
to the great Creator and Governor of the Universe,

<span id="page_68">p. 68</span>

and an unlimited affection to the beings of his creation, of all
characters, and of every denomination. This last duty is forcibly
inculcated by the example of the Deity himself, who liberally dispenses
his beneficence to unnumbered worlds.

It is not particularly our province to enter into a disquisition of
every branch of this amiable virtue; we shall only briefly state the
happy effects of a benevolent disposition towards mankind, and show that
charity, exerted on proper objects, is the greatest pleasure man can
possibly enjoy.

The bounds of the greatest nation or the most extensive empire cannot
circumscribe the generosity of a liberal mind. Men, in whatever
situation they are placed, are still in a great measure the same. They
are exposed to similar dangers and misfortunes: they have not wisdom to
foresee, or power to prevent the evils incident to human nature: they
hang, as it were, in a perpetual suspense between hope and fear,
sickness and health, plenty and want. A mutual chain of dependence
subsists throughout the animal creation. The whole human species are,
therefore, proper objects for the exercise of charity.

Beings who partake of one common nature ought to be actuated by the same
motives and interests. Hence, to soothe the unhappy, by sympathizing
with their misfortunes, and to restore peace and tranquillity to
agitated spirits, constitute the general and great ends of the Masonic
institution. This humane, this generous disposition, fires the breast
with manly feelings, and enlivens that spirit of compassion which is the
glory of the human frame, and which not only rivals, but outshines,
every other pleasure the mind is capable of enjoying.

All human passions, when directed by the superior principle of reason,
promote some useful purpose; but compassion towards proper objects is
the most beneficial of all the affections, and excites the most lasting
degrees of happiness, as it extends to greater numbers, and tends to
alleviate the infirmities and evils which are incident to human
existence.

Possessed of this amiable, this god-like disposition, Masons are shocked
at misery, under every form and appearance. When we behold an object
pining under the miseries of a distressed body or mind, the healing
accents which flow from the tongue mitigate the pain of the unhappy
sufferer, and make even adversity, in its dismal state, look gay. When
our pity is excited, we assuage grief,

<span id="page_69">p. 69</span>

and cheerfully relieve distress. If a brother be in want, every heart is
moved; when he is hungry, we feed him; when he is naked, we clothe him;
when he is in trouble, we fly to his relief. Thus we confirm the
propriety of the title we bear, and convince the world at large that
BROTHER, among Masons, is something more than a name.

The newly-initiated brother is then conducted to his proper station, \*
\* \* \* \* \* \* \* \*, where he receives his first lesson in moral
architecture, teaching him ever to walk uprightly before Clod and man.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_9"></span>[67:\*](gar18.htm#fr_9.md) The Order of the Garter
was instituted by King EDWARD M. In 1344; and though not the most
ancient, is one of the most famous of the military orders of Europe.
SELDEN says that it "exceeds—in majesty, honor, and fame—all chivalrous
orders in the world." The Star and the Garter are the insignia bestowed
upon and worn by a Knight.
