#### DEGREE OF MASTER MASON.

#### Symbolism of the Degree

WE have seen the type of man complete in moral worth and intellectual
culture—not left to acquire knowledge, but first prepared to use that
knowledge well, when it shall have been obtained. What more is left?
Communion with our Maker. The mere knowledge of the Deity, as given us
heretofore, is that of an august Creator, whom we are to reverence, and
in whom alone we are to place our trust. But we have not yet seen him
walking upon the earth, and holding open communion with the sons of men.
Man has not yet been ennobled by personal contact with the All-Holy.

Let us imagine a conception perfectly in accordance with the ideas and
opinions of our early brethren. "Who has at any time seen GOD, and
lived?" "ADAM, our first progenitor." "But only in the days of his
innocence. Since the day when all mankind was corrupted by his fall, no
living man has looked upon the face of the Almighty."

Now, what would be the natural opinion of our ancient brethren as to the
means of securing GOD'S actual presence? We know that, for a thousand
years, men labored to find the true name of JEHOVAH, which they believed
would be a talisman, giving them power over all the secrets of the
Universe. Union, of the most unselfish nature, formed the grand
characteristic of our Fraternity. Ambition, desire for fame—every
passion which appeals to the self-love of man—was

<span id="page_188">p. 188</span>

merged in the perfect union engendered by an adherence to the tenets of
the Order to such a degree, that the names even of our great architects
have not come down to us, though their works still stand, to attest
their excellence. All was the work of brethren, and each was allowed his
share of the glory.

Now, with this perfect union, and with the knowledge that the belief
.existed that it was through the weakness of man only that he could not
endure the presence of his Creator, what so natural as to suppose that
if three brethren be found as types respectively of moral, intellectual,
and physical perfection, and they be joined together in holy fellowship
which should make their very souls as one, they might, in mystic union,
call upon the great and sacred name of the Deity, and receive an answer
to their prayer? That this idea did prevail, we have sufficient proof;
and it is to this, rather than to any more utilitarian views, that we
are to look for the rule which, in a purely speculative institution, so
sternly demands physical, as well as moral and intellectual integrity.

We know that the wise and good of the days of SOLOMON regarded his
idolatry as an evidence that the countenance of the All-Holy had been
darkened to him; that he no longer held the interviews with the
ONLY-WISE GOD, through which they deemed that his superhuman wisdom
came. And indeed it would seem to them a thing monstrous and wholly
unnatural, that the being whose intellect had been illumined from above,
and to whom JEHOVAH had promised wisdom beyond that of men, should
grovel in adoration before false gods, did they not also believe that it
was only through direct and constant communion with the Almighty that
this wisdom could continue; and now that he no longer sought that
presence, he was given over to the blind guidance of his passions

This degree is a type of the communion of man with GOD. Long before the
incarnation of that great Being, was the

<span id="page_189">p. 189</span>

hope entertained of seeing him with mortal eyes, and no exertions were
deemed too great to insure that consummation. With us, these ideas are
but a type; for we have that realization so longed for by the brethren
of old. And yet, as a type, how interesting it is to look back upon
their struggles to look forward into what is now bright and clear!

The practical lessons to be found in the full exposition of the
ceremonies of this degree, require us to be complete in our duty to our
neighbor, before we can venture to direct him. Step by step, mounting
from the lowest to the highest, we must prove to ourselves that we would
serve him—pray for him—sympathize with his inmost feelings, and sustain
him from falling, before we can venture to counsel him, even to his
good—far less, dictate to him.

We now find man complete in morality and intelligence, with the stay of
RELIGION added, to insure him of the protection of the Deity, and guard
him against ever going astray. These three degrees thus form a perfect
and harmonious whole; nor can we conceive that any thing can be
suggested more, which the soul of man requires.

### THIRD LECTURE.

FREEMASONRY, in every degree, as before remarked, is progressive. A
knowledge of it can only be attained by time, patience, and application.
In the first degree, we are taught the duties we owe to GOD, our
neighbor, and ourselves. In the second, we are more thoroughly inducted
into the mysteries of moral science, and learn to trace the goodness and
majesty of the Creator, by minutely analyzing his works. But the third
degree is the cement of the whole. It is calculated to bind men together
by mystic points of fellowship, as in a bond of fraternal affection and
brotherly love. It is

<span id="page_190">p. 190</span>

among brethren of this degree that the ancient Landmarks of the Order
are preserved, and it is from them that we derive that fund of
information which none but ingenious and expert Masons can supply.

It is also from brethren of this degree that the rulers of the Craft are
selected; because it is only from those who are capable of giving
instruction that we can reasonably expect to receive it.

#### SECTION I.

THE first section in this, as in the two preceding degrees, is
initiatory; and a knowledge of it is indispensable to every brother who
would make himself useful in the ceremonial transactions of a Lodge.

<span id="img_19000"></span> ![](img/19000.jpg)

The Compasses are peculiarly consecrated to this degree, because within
their extreme points, when properly extended, are emblematically said to
be inclosed the principal tenets of our profession; and hence the moral
application of the Compasses, in the third degree, is to those precious
jewels of a Master Mason—Friendship, Morality, and Brotherly Love.

The following passage of Scripture is introduced during the ceremonies:

Remember now thy Creator in the days of thy youth, while the evil days
come not, nor

<span id="page_191">p. 191</span>

the years draw nigh, when thou shalt say, I have no pleasure in them;
while the sun, or the light, or the moon, or the stars, be not darkened,
nor the clouds return after the rain; in the day when the keepers of the
house shall tremble, and the strong men shall bow themselves, and the
grinders cease, because they are few, and those that look out of the
windows he darkened, and the doors shall be shut in the streets when the
sound of the grinding is low, and he shall rise up at the voice of the
bird, and all the daughters of Music shall be brought low; also, when
they shall be afraid of that which is high, and fears shall be in the
way, and the almond-tree shall flourish, and the grasshopper shall be a
burden, and desire shall fail; because man goeth to his long home, and
the mourners go about the streets: or ever the silver cord be loosed, or
the golden bowl be broken, or the pitcher be broken at the fountain, or
the wheel broken at the cistern. Then shall the dust return to the earth
as it was; and the spirit shall return unto GOD who gave it.—ECCL. xii.
1-7.

The passage of Scripture here selected is a beautiful and affecting
description of the body of man suffering under the infirmities of old
age, and metaphorically compared to a worn-out house about to fall

<span id="page_192">p. 192</span>

into decay. How appropriate is such an introduction to the sublime and
awful ceremonies of that degree, in which death, the resurrection, and
life eternal are the lessons to be taught by all its symbols and
allegories!—MACKEY's Manual of the Lodge.

Or the following ODE may be sung:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Let us remember in our youth,  
  Before the evil days draw nigh,  
Our great Creator, and his Truth!  
  Ere mem’ry fail and pleasures fly;  
Or sun, or moon, or planets’ light  
  Grow <span id="page_193">p. 193</span> dark, or clouds return in
gloom;  
Ere vital spark no more incite;  
  When strength shall bow and years consume.</span>

</div>

<span id="img_19300"></span> <span align="CENTER"> [![](tn/19300.jpg)  
Click to enlarge](img/19300.jpg.md)</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Let us in youth remember HIM!  
  Who formed our frame, and spirits gave,  
Ere windows of the mind grow dim  
  Or door of speech obstructed wave;  
When voice of bird fresh terrors wake,  
  And Music's daughters charm no more,  
Or fear to rise, with trembling shake  
  Along the path we travel o’er.

In youth, to GOD let memory cling,  
  Before desire shall fail or wane,  
Or ere be loosed life's silver string,  
  Or bowl at fountain rent in twain;  
For man to his long home doth go,  
  And mourners group around his urn;  
Our dust, to dust again must flow,  
  And spirits unto GOD return.
