Textual Heritage

#### THE SYMBOLS OF

#### Peace, Unity and Plenty

Are introduced, and their moral application explained.

#### OF THE GLOBES.

The *Globes* are two artificial spherical bodies, on the convex surface
of which are represented the countries, seas, and various parts of the
earth, the face of the heavens, the planetary revolutions, and other
important particulars.

#### THE USE OF THE GLOBES.

Their principal use, besides serving as maps to distinguish the outward
parts of the earth, and the situation of the fixed stars, is to
illustrate and explain the phenomena arising from the annual revolution
and the diurnal rotation

of the earth around its own axis. They are invaluable instruments for
improving the mind, and giving it the most distinct idea of any problem
or proposition, as well as enabling it to solve the same. Contemplating
these bodies, we are inspired with a due reverence for the Deity and his
works, and are induced to encourage the studies of Astronomy, Geography,
Navigation, and the Arts dependent on them, by which society has been so
much benefited.
