| "How far any will be guided by me I hope I shall always know myself so well as to leave that to their own choice. As to the inutility of my inquiries, and also the impartiality of them, here I confess myself to wish (as I think what I wish) they may be good, not absolutely terminating upon myself, that the reader will consider them with as unbiassed a freedom as I have written."—SHUCKFORD. |

# PREFACE.

<span class="small">"IN the present state of Freemasonry, dispersed as
it is over the whole face of the habitable globe, and distinguished by
an anxious inquiry, whether its reputed origin be well founded, and
whether its philosophy and the evidences on which its claims to public
notice are entitled to the implicit credence of mankind, it is the duty
of every Brother, so far as his influence may extend, to furnish the
means of satisfying this ardent curiosity."—OLIVER.</span>

AMONG the many beautiful and appropriate definitions given to
Freemasonry none is more comprehensive than the one to be found in the
English lectures: "Freemasonry is a science of morality, vailed in
allegory and illustrated by symbols."

Freemasonry, then, most prominently presents itself to our view as a
science of symbolism. In the teachings of the ancient priesthood this
science was first developed. Among them it was organized into a
beautiful and impressive system, in which the most profound lessons of
Divine Truth were taught in images of poetical form. It was thus that
the ancient philosophers communicated all their instructions to their
disciples. Having these views of the purposes of the institution, the
undersigned has labored in the vineyard of Masonic symbolism for the
advancement to a higher knowledge and an easier elucidation of its
beautiful mysteries by the aid of symbols and moral illustrations.

The great object sought to be attained in the present volume is to give
a more ample scope and a freer use of terms, whereby the Masonic student
may become familiar with the great truths taught in the science of
Freemasonry. The frequent applications of emendations and explanatory
remarks to the ritualistic text may be easily understood by those who
have been admitted into its temples, while the profane will have a
better appreciation of its claims to something more than a name.

The usual forms and explanations incident to a complete monitor have
been carefully revised, and are, it is believed, correct.

A new feature, in compliance with a very generally expressed want of the
Fraternity, has been added in the Ritual for a Lodge of Sorrow, prepared
by a well-known and distinguished Masonic writer, which, it is thought,
will be welcomed as a most appropriate form for celebrating the memory
of the fraternal dead.

To those brethren who have, with uniform kindness, favored me with their
valuable aid I acknowledge with thanks my indebtedness.

DANIEL SICKELS.

NEW YORK, Dec., 1865.
