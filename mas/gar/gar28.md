### The Ornaments of a Lodge

Are the MOSAIC PAVEMENT, the INDENTED TESSEL, and the BLAZING STAR.

The Mosaic Pavement is a representation of the ground-floor of King
Solomon's Temple; the Indented Tessel, <span

border or skirting which surrounded it. The Mosaic Pavement is
emblematical of human life, checkered with good and evil; the Indented
Tessel, or Tesselated Border, of the manifold blessings and comforts
which constantly surround us, and which we hope to enjoy by a firm
reliance on Divine Providence, which is hieroglyphically represented by
the Blazing Star in the center.

As the steps of man are tried in the various and uncertain incidents of
life; as our days are checkered with a strange contrariety of events,
and our passage through this existence, though sometimes attended with
prosperous circumstances, is often beset by a multitude of evils; hence
is the Lodge furnished with Mosaic work, to remind us of the
precariousness of our state on earth: to-day, our feet tread in
prosperity; to-morrow, we totter on the uneven paths of weakness,
temptation, and adversity. While this emblem is before us, we are
instructed to boast of nothing; to have compassion, and give aid to
those who are in adversity; to walk uprightly, and with humility; for
such is this existence, that there is no station in which pride can be
stably founded: all men, in birth and in the grave, are on a level.
While we tread on this Mosaic work, let our ideas return to the
original, which it copies; and let every Freemason act as the dictates
of reason prompt him to live in brotherly love.
