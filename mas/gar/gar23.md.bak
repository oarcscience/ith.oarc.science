### SECTION III.

THIS section fully explains the manner of constituting, and the proper
authority for holding a Lodge. Here, also, we learn where Lodges were
anciently held; their FORM, SUPPORT, COVERING, FURNITURE, ORNAMENTS,
LIGHTS, and JEWELS; how situated, and to whom dedicated, as well in
former times as at present.

A Lodge is an assemblage of Masons, duly congregated, having the Holy
Bible, Square, and Compasses, and a Charter or Warrant, authorizing them
to work.
