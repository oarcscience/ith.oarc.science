#### THE TWELVE MESSENGERS.

In the old philosophies, the number 12 always concealed a mystical
sense, and was considered a symbol of divine ideas. But here the twelve
F. C. represent the companions of Isis, who assisted her in her long and
wearisome search after the body of the slain OSIRIS.

#### THE ACACIA-TREE.

The "sprig of acacia" has, in the Masonic system, a solemn importance.
It is a handsome tree, noted for its remarkably graceful and flexible
leaves, of yellowish green, which droop down, and wave in the breeze,
like luxuriant locks of hair. It held a sacred place in the ancient
initiations, and, like the weeping-willow, was the symbol of tender
sympathy and undying affection. An emblem, too, of immortality, it was
most fittingly employed to mark the last resting-place of the
distinguished dead.

#### THE LETTER G.

This letter is deservedly regarded as one of the most sacred of the
Masonic emblems. Where it is used, however, as a symbol of Deity, it
must be remembered that it is the Saxon representative of the Hebrew
*Yod* and the Greek *Tau*—the initial letters of the Eternal in those
languages.

This symbol proves that Freemasonry always prosecuted its labors with
reference to the grand ideas of Infinity and Eternity. By the letter
**G**—which conveyed to the minds of the brethren, at the same time, the
idea of GOD and that of Geometry—it bound heaven to earth, the divine to
the human, and the infinite to the finite.

Masons are taught to regard the Universe as the grandest of all symbols,
revealing to men, in all ages, the ideas which are eternally revolving
in the mind of the Divinity, and which it is their duty to reproduce in
their own lives and in the world of art and industry. Thus GOD and
Geometry, the material worlds and the spiritual spheres, were constantly
united in the speculations of the ancient Masons. They, consequently,
labored earnestly and unweariedly, not only to construct cities, and
embellish them with magnificent

edifices, but also to build up a temple of great and divine thoughts and
of ever-growing virtues for the soul to dwell in.

The symbolical letter G—

<span class="small">\*  \*  \* "That Hieroglyphic bright,  
Which none but Craftsmen ever saw,"</span>

</div>

and before which every true Mason reverently uncovers, and bows his
head—is a perpetual condemnation of profanity, impiety, and vice. No
brother who has bowed before that emblem, can be profane. He will never
speak the name of the Grand Master of the Universe but with reverence,
respect, and love. He will learn, by studying the mystic meaning of the
letter G, to model his life after the divine plan; and, thus instructed,
he will strive to be like GOD in the activity and earnestness of his
benevolence, and the broadness and efficiency of his charity.
