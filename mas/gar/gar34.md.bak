### CHARGE,

#### AT THE INITIATION OF A SOLDIER.

BROTHER: Our institution breathes a spirit of general philanthropy. Its
benefits, in a social point of view, are extensive. In the most
endearing ties, it unites all mankind. In every nation, wherever
civilization extends—and not unfrequently among the wild savages of the
forest—it opens an asylum to a

brother in distress, and grants hospitality to the necessitous and
unfortunate. The sublime principles of universal goodness and love to
all mankind, which are essential to it, cannot be lost in national
distinctions, prejudices, and animosities. The rage of contest and the
sanguinary conflict have, by its recognized principles, been abated, and
the milder emotions of humanity substituted. It has often performed the
part of the Angel of Goodness, in ministering to the wants of the sick,
the wounded, and the unfortunate prisoner of war. It has even taught the
pride of victory to give way to the dictates of an honorable connection.

Pure patriotism will always animate you to every call of your country to
repel an invading foreign foe, or in subduing the rebellious intentions
of those within the limits of our own land who become faithless to the
high duty of a citizen. But should you, while engaged in the service of
your country, be made captive, you may find affectionate brethren where
others would only find enemies.

The institution also demands that you shall be a quiet and peaceable
citizen, true to your government, and just to your country; yielding
obedience to the laws which afford you protection.

In whatever country you travel, when you meet a Mason, you will find a
brother and a friend, who will do all in his power to serve you; and who
will relieve you, should you be poor or in distress, to the utmost of
his ability, and with a ready cheerfulness.
