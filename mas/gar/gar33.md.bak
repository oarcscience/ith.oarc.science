### CHARGE TO THE CANDIDATE.

BROTHER: As you are now introduced into the first principles of Masonry,
I congratulate you on being accepted into this ancient and honorable
Order:—ancient, as having subsisted from time immemorial; and honorable,
as tending, in every particular, so to render all men who will be
conformable to its precepts. No institution was ever raised on a better
principle or more solid foundation; nor were ever more excellent rules
and useful maxims laid down, than are inculcated in the several Masonic
lectures. The greatest and best of men, in all ages, have been
encouragers and promoters of the art; and have never deemed it
derogatory to their dignity to level themselves with the Fraternity,
extend their privileges, and patronize their assemblies. There are three
great duties which, as a Mason, you are charged to inculcate:—to GOD,
your neighbor, and yourself. To GOD, in never mentioning His name but
with that reverential awe which is due from a creature to his Creator;
to

<span id="page_100">p. 100</span>

implore His aid in all your laudable undertakings, and to esteem Him as
the chief good; to your neighbor, in acting upon the square, and doing
unto him as you wish he should do unto you; and to yourself, in avoiding
all irregularity and intemperance, which may impair your faculties, or
debase the dignity of your profession. A zealous attachment to these
duties will insure public and private esteem.

In the state, you are to be a quiet and peaceful citizen, true to your
government, and just to your country; you are not to countenance
disloyalty or rebellion, but patiently submit to legal authority, and
conform with cheerfulness to the government of the country in which you
live. In your outward demeanor, be particularly careful to avoid censure
and reproach.

Although your frequent appearance at our regular meetings is earnestly
solicited, yet it is not meant that Masonry should interfere with your
necessary vocations; for these are on no account to be neglected;
neither are you to suffer your zeal for the institution to lead you into
argument with those who, through ignorance, may ridicule it.

<span id="page_101">p. 101</span>

At your leisure hours, that you may improve in Masonic knowledge, you
are to converse with well-informed brethren, who will be always as ready
to give, as you will be to receive, instruction.

Finally, keep sacred and inviolable the mysteries of the Order; as these
are to distinguish you from the rest of the community, and mark your
consequence among Masons. If, in the circle of your acquaintance, you
find a person desirous of being initiated into Masonry, be particularly
careful not to recommend him, unless you are convinced he will conform
to our rules; that the honor, glory, and reputation of the institution
may be firmly established, and the world at large convinced of its good
effects.
