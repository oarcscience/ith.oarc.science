<p>THESE two words have acquired a wide Masonic celebrity. They constituted the title of the Book of Constitutions, used by the division of Freemasons, which separated from the Grand Lodge of England in 1736, and have since become the usual designation of such works in this country. DERMOTT, in 1772, styled his book the TRUE <i>Ahiman Rezon</i>, and he claimed for his portion of the Order the practice of Ancient Masonry. The inference is obvious that there was a spurious work under this title then extant. An inquiry into their meaning is, therefore, not irrelevant.</p>  
<p>I have met with no exposition of the signification of this phrase, except in the edition first published in South Carolina by Dr. DALCHO, in 1807, and reprinted, with additions, in 1822; and afterward re-arranged and edited by Dr. MACKEY in 1852; and, also, in the "<i>Lexicon of Freemasonry</i>," by the last-mentioned distinguished author.</p>  
<p>The following is Dr. DALCHO'S definition in the edition of 1822: "The Book of Constitutions is usually denominated AHIMAN REZON. The literal translation of <i>ahiman</i> is a <i>prepared brother</i>, from <i>manah</i>, <i>to prepare;</i> and that of <i>rezon</i>, <i>secret</i>. So that Ahiman Rezon literally means <i>the secrets</i> of a <i>prepared brother</i>. It is likewise supposed to be a corruption of <i>achi</i><i> man ratzon</i>, the thoughts or opinions of a true and faithful brother."</p>  
<p>There are several difficulties which seem to render this definition inadmissible. The derivations do not appear to be in accordance with the structure of the Hebrew language (if the words be Hebrew); and the phrase, with this view of its derivation, has no grammatical construction. The Hebrews were accustomed to a species of inversion, which in our language has no parallel: for example, <i>the great work of Jehovah</i> would be in Hebrew &#8207;&#1502;&#1506;&#1513;&#1492; &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1497; &#1492;&#1504;&#1491;&#1493;&#1465;&#1500;&#8206;, literally, <i>work of Jehovah the great</i>. Now, if the phrase under consideration was intended to import "the secrets of a prepared brother," the construction would have been, according to the example just</p>  
<p><a name="page_6"><font size="1" color="green">p. 6</font></A></p>  
<p>quoted, <i>ahi</i><i> rezon man</i>. But there are further objections to this rendering of the phrase into English. True, &#8207;&#1502;&#1504;&#1492;&#8206; <i>MNE</i>, to divide, <i>to number</i>, in its piel form, signifies to appoint, to constitute, and, in that sense, to prepare; yet, in accordance with the genius of the Hebrew tongue, it undergoes a change in its vocalization. Its stem-letter is doubled, and the vowel sound softened; it is pronounced <i>minnah</i>, and its derivative should be <i>ahiminnah</i>. In Chaldee, &#8207;&#1512;&#1494;&#8206; <i>RZ</i> signifies a secret, and might be imported into the Hebrew, but its plural is <i>razin</i><i>;</i> besides, it is something of a misnomer to call a published book "<i>Secrets</i> of a prepared brother."</p>  
<p>The last suggestion of Dr. DALCHO would seem more plausible, if it were not open to the same grammatical objection. <i>MAN</i> can not signify <i>true</i> or <i>faithful</i>, unless derived from &#8207;&#1488;&#1502;&#1503;&#8206; <i>AMN</i>, and then the compound word would be <i>achiamon</i><i>;</i> and if the &#8207;&#1488;&#8206; <i>A</i> of <i>AMN</i> suffered elision, it would indicate a different radical, and if no elision took place, the two letters &#8207;&#1497;&#8206; <i>I</i> and &#8207;&#1488;&#8206; <i>A</i> would not coalesce, but the &#8207;&#1497;&#8206; <i>I</i> resumes its consonant sound as in &#8207;&#1489;&#1504;&#1497;&#1502;&#1497;&#1503;&#8206; <i>BNIMIN</i> (which we sound Benjamin), the vocalization would then be <i>Abhjamon</i>.</p>  
<p>Dr. MACKEY thus renders it:&#8212;"This title is derived from three Hebrew words&#8212;<i>ahim</i>, brothers; <i>manah</i>, to select or appoint; and <i>ratzon</i>, the will or law&#8212;and it, consequently, signifies "the law of appointed or selected brothers."</p>  
<p>It is true, that this definition more nearly accords with what the book contains, than that proposed by DALCHO; yet, there would seem to be no less formidable objections to this view of its signification. The verb &#8207;&#1502;&#1504;&#1492;&#8206; MNE, above referred to by DALCHO, in Kal, (i.e., its active form) means to appoint, but its radical meaning is to number; it was one of the prophetic words written by the spectral hand on the wall of Belshazzar's banqueting-room. It is itself a derivative, and will not rid us of the final &#8207;&#1492;&#8206; <i>E</i>, and if it be any part of the root of the word, we must read <i>ahimanah</i>. It is just to notice, that the radical of this verb, signifying something divided &#8207;&#1502;&#1503;&#8206; MN, from the obsolete root &#8207;&#1502;&#1504;&#1503;&#8206; <i>MNN</i>, when in composition, conveys the idea of a <i>law</i>, <i>rule</i> or <i>precept</i>, in conformity with which something is done; as, for example, &#8207;&#1502;&#1508;&#1497; &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;&#8206; <i>MPhI</i><i> IHOH</i> by command of JEHOVAH (II. Chron. xxxvi. 12), but then the grammatical construction would require some other signification of <i>rezon</i>, and it should be construed as an adjective, in conformity with the example above quoted, and it might read <i>ahi</i>, being the genitive singular (&#8207;&#1488;&#1492;&#1497;&#8206; <i>AHI</i>,) the "<i>Supreme Law of a Brother</i>."</p>
