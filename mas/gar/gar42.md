### The Winding Stairs.

The door for the middle chamber was in the right side of the house; and
they went up with winding stairs into the middle chamber.—I. KINGS vi.
8. <span id="fr_24"></span>[\*](#fn_24.md)

THE SYMBOLICAL STAIRWAY, which leads front the ground-floor to the
Middle Chamber of our mystic house, consists of fifteen steps and three
divisions. The divisions, we perceive, differ in the number of their
steps, each having an odd number—"three, five, and seven." While there
is no positive evidence that these divisions have any particular
reference to Ancient Craft Masonry, yet the lessons taught us, as we
ascend, should impress upon the mind of every Freemason the importance
of discipline, as well as a knowledge of natural, mathematical, and
metaphysical science It also opens to him an extensive range of moral
and speculative inquiry, which may prove a source of peculiar
gratification.

Reference is here made to the Masonic organization into three
degrees—the Entered Apprentice, the Fellow-Craft, and the Master Mason;
and to its system of government by three officers—the Worshipful Master,
the Senior Warden, and the Junior Warden.
