### THE SYMBOLIC PILGRIMAGE.

THE institution of Freemasonry—reaching backward until it loses itself
among the mythological shadows of the past, its grand ritual and
eloquent language of signs and symbols, originating in those distant
ages—offers a field for exploration which can never be thoroughly
traversed. Transmitted to us by remote generations, it is plain that,
before we can, in any degree, appreciate Freemasonry, or understand the
significance of its mysteries, we must go back to the Past, and question
the founders of the Order. We must learn in what necessities of human
nature, and for what purpose it was created. We must discover the true
genesis of our rites, and become familiar with the ideas which the
Fathers intended to shadow forth through them, and impress upon the
mind. It is not enough for us to accept the *letter* of the ceremonial,
and perform it blindly, interpreting its meaning in whatever way fancy
or imagination or convenience may dictate. We should know what the
Ancients meant to say through it: what truth each rite and each symbol
represented to *their* minds.

From age to age, through countless generations, these Rites have read
their sublime lessons of wisdom and hope, and peace and warning, to the
"Sons of Light." These same lessons, in the same language, they read to
us to-day. But do we see in them what they did? Do they impress us as
they impressed them? Or do they pass before our eyes like a panorama of
some unknown land, which has no delineator to tell us what or where it
is, or give us any intelligible notion regarding it? Accepting the
symbol, have we lost its sense? Our Rites will be of little value to us
if this be the case. It is our duty, then, to make Freemasonry the
object of a profound study. We must consult the Past. We must stand by
the sarcophagus of the murdered, but restored Osiris, in Egypt; enter
the caverns of Phrygia, and hold communion with the Cabiri; penetrate
the "Collegia Fabrorum" of ancient Rome, and work in the mystic circles
of Sidon. In a word, we must pursue our researches until we find the
THOUGHT that lay in the minds of those who created the institution and
founded our mysteries. Then we shall

<span id="page_57">p. 57</span>

know precisely what they mean. We shall see in them a grand series of
moral and philosophical dramas, most eloquent and instructive, gleaming
with sublime ideas, as the heavens glow with stars. And, finally, we
shall discover that our Rites embrace all the possible circumstances of
man—moral, spiritual, and social—and have a meaning high as the heavens,
broad as the universe, and profound as eternity,

The Rite of the Wanderer, or the Symbolic Pilgrimage, is entirely
puerile and unmeaning, unless we have learned in what ideas it
originated, and what its authors intended to represent by it. Happily,
this is not a difficult task. In Egypt, Greece, and among other ancient
nations, Freemasonry was one of the earliest agencies employed to effect
the improvement and enlightenment of man. CICERO tells us that "the
establishment of these Rites among the Athenians, conferred upon them a
supreme benefit. *Their effect was to civilize men, reform their wild
and ferocious manners, and make them comprehend the true principles of
morality, which initiate man into a new order of life, more worthy of a
being destined to imortality*."—Consequently, the mystic journey
primarily represented the toilsome progress of Humanity, from its
primitive condition of ignorance and barbarism to a state of
civilization and mental enlightenment. The Neophyte, therefore,
wandering in darkness over his winding way, meeting with various
obstructions and delays, was a typo of the human race, struggling onward
and upward by devious stages, from the gloom and darkness of the savage
state to the light, intelligence, and comforts of civilized life.

This symbolic journey is also emblematical of the pilgrimage of life,
which, man soon enough discovers, is often dark and gloomy, surrounded
by sorrow, and fear, and doubt. It teaches him that over this dark,
perplexed, and fearful course lays the way to a glorious destiny; that
through night to *light* must the earth-pilgrim work his way; that by
struggle, and toil, and earnest endeavor, he must advance with courage
and hope until, free of every fetter, and in the full light of virtue
and knowledge, he stands face to face with the mighty secrets of the
universe, and attains that lofty height, whence he can look backward
over the night-shrouded and tortuous path in which he had been
wandering, and forward to sublimer elevation—to more glorious ideals,
which seem to say to him, "On, on for ever!"

Such, then, is the grand and inspiring lesson which this Symbolic
Pilgrimage is perpetualy repeating to the brethren. Let them study

<span id="page_58">p. 58</span>

it well, and labor with faith; for it announces a progress in science
and virtue, which will reach through eternity.

The Lodge, when revealed to an entering Mason, discovers to him a
representation of the world; in which, from the wonders of Nature, we
are led to contemplate the great Original, and worship him for his
mighty works; and we are, thereby, also moved to exercise those moral
and social virtues, which become mankind to observe, as the servants of
the Great Architect of the world, in whose image we were formed from the
beginning.

The following passage of Scripture is rehearsed during the ceremony:

Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together
in unity.

It is like the precious ointment upon the head, that ran down upon the
beard, even Aaron's beard; that went down to the skirts of his garment.

As the dew of Hermon, and as the dew that descended upon the mountains
of Zion; for there the Lord commanded the blessing, even life for
evermore.

"The great teaching of this Psalm is Brotherly Love, that virtue which
forms the most prominent tenet of the Masonic Order. And it teaches the
lesson, too, precisely as we do, by a symbol, comparing it to the
precious ointment used in the consecration of the High-Priest, whose
delightful perfume filled the whole place with its odor. The ointment
was poured upon the head in such quantity, that, being directed by the
anointer in different ways in the form of a cross, it flowed at length
down the beard, and finally dropped from the flowing skirts of the
priestly garment.

<span id="page_59">p. 59</span>

"The fifteen Psalms, from the 120th to the 134th, inclusive, of which
this, of course, is one, are called by the Hebrews 'songs of degrees,'
because they were sung on the fifteen steps ascending from the court of
Israel to the court of the women in the Temple."

Or the following ODE may be sung:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Behold! how pleasant and how good,  
  For brethren such as we,  
Of the Accepted brotherhood  
  To dwell in unity!  
’Tis like the oil on Aaron's head  
  Which <span id="page_60">p. 60</span> to his feet distills;  
Like Hermon's dew so richly shed  
  On Zion's sacred hills!</span>

</div>

<span id="img_06000"></span> <span align="CENTER"> [![](tn/06000.jpg)

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">For there the Lord of light and love  
  A blessing sent with power;  
Oh, may we all this blessing prove,  
  E’en life for evermore!  
On Friendship's altar, rising here,  
  Our hands now plighted be,  
To live in love, with hearts sincere,  
  In peace and unity.</span>

It is the duty of the Master of the Lodge, as one of the precautionary
measures of initiation, to explain to the candidate the nature and
design of the institution; and while he informs him that it is founded
on the purest principles of virtue; that it possesses great and
invaluable privileges; and that, in order to secure those privileges to
worthy men, and worthy men alone, voluntary pledges of fidelity are
required; he will at the same time assure him that nothing will be
expected of him incompatible with his civil, moral, or religions duties.
