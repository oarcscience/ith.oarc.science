# FIRST DEGREE.

# ENTERED APPRENTICE.

"There are many prominent emblems in this degree, teaching, first, the
propriety of maintaining regularity of life, and attending to the due
improvement of time, by conforming to the prescribed rules, for which
eight hours are allotted to repose, eight to labor, and eight to the
service of GOD. Secondly, the cleansing of our hearts and minds from
every vice, is inculcated, thereby fitting our bodies as living stones
for that spiritual edifice built by the Grand Architect of the Universe.
There are many other emblems in this First Step, representing human life
as being chequered with good and evil; pointing to the comforts and
blessings that surround us, and impressing upon our minds the necessity
of a reliance on Divine Providence. Our imperfect condition by nature is
likewise adverted to, and the state of perfection to which we hope to
arrive by virtuous education, aided by the blessing of GOD upon our own
endeavors, and a due observance of the Holy Scriptures, as pointing out
the whole duty of man. Indeed, everything in this degree is adapted to
impress upon the mind of the candidate the necessity of maintaining
purity of life and conduct, in order to ensure a happy
immortality."—STONE.
