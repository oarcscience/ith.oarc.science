#### SERVICE

###### AT THE

##### CHURCH OR THE HOUSE OF THE DECEASED.

After the religious services have been performed, the Master will take
his station at the head of the coffin, the Senior Warden on his right,
the Junior Warden on his left; the Deacons and Stewards, with white rods
crossed, the former at the head and the latter at the foot of the
coffin; the brethren forming a circle around all, when the Masonic
service will commence by the Chaplain or Master repeating the following
or some other appropriate PRAYER, in which all the brethren will join:

Our Father which art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come.
Thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily
bread. And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors. And lead us
not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For thine is the kingdom,
and the power, and the glory, for ever.—AMEN.

*Master*. Brethren, we are called upon by the imperious mandate of the
dread messenger Death, against whose free entrance within the circle of
our Fraternity the barred doors and Tiler's weapon offer no impediment,
to

<span id="page_324">p. 324</span>

mourn the loss of one of our companions. The dead body of our beloved
Brother A...... B......  lies in its narrow house before us, overtaken
by that fate which must sooner or later overtake us all; and which no
power or station, no virtue or bravery, no wealth or honor, no tears of
friends or agonies of relatives can avert; teaching an impressive
lesson, continually repeated, yet soon forgotten, that every one of us
must ere long pass through the valley of the shadow of death, and dwell
in the house of darkness.

*Sen. War.* In the midst of life we are in death; of whom may we seek
for succor but of thee, O LORD, who for our sins art justly displeased.
Thou knowest, Loan, the secrets of our hearts; shut not thy merciful
ears to our prayer,

*Jun. War.* LORD, let me know my end, and the number of my days; that I
may be certified how long I have to live.

*Master*. Man that is born of woman is of few days and full of trouble.
He cometh forth as a flower, and is cut down; he fleeth also as a
shadow, and continueth not. Seeing his days are determined, the number
of his months are

<span id="page_325">p. 325</span>

with thee; thou hast appointed his bounds that he cannot pass; turn from
him that he may rest, till he shall accomplish his day. For there is
hope of a tree, if it be cut down, that it will sprout again, and that
the tender branch thereof will not cease. But man dieth and wasteth
away; yea, man giveth up the ghost, and where is he? As the waters fail
from the sea, and the flood decayeth and drieth up, so man lieth down,
and riseth not up till the heavens shall be no more.

*Sen. War.* Our life is but a span long, and the days of our pilgrimage
are few and full of evil.

*Jun. War.* So teach us to number our days, that we may apply our hearts
unto wisdom.

*Master*. Man goeth forth to his work and to his labor until the evening
of his day. The labor and work of our brother are finished. As it hath
pleased Almighty GOD to take the soul of our departed brother, may he
find mercy in the great day when all men shall be judged according to
the deeds done in the body. We must walk in the light while we have
light; for the darkness of death may come upon us, at a time when we may
not be prepared. Take heed,

<span id="page_326">p. 326</span>

therefore, watch and pray; for ye know not when the time is; ye know not
when the Master cometh, at even; at midnight, or in the morning. We
should so regulate our lives by the line of rectitude and truth, that in
the evening of our days we may be found worthy to be called from labor
to refreshment, and duly prepared for a translation from the terrestrial
to the celestial Lodge, to join the Fraternity of the spirits of just
men made perfect.

*Sen. War.* Behold, O LORD, we are in distress! Our hearts are turned
within us; there is none to comfort us; our sky is darkened with clouds,
and mourning and lamentations are heard among us.

*Jun. War.* Our life is a vapor that appeareth for a little while, and
then vanisheth away. All flesh is as grass, and all the glory of man as
the flower of grass. The grass withereth, and the flower thereof falleth
away.

*Master*. It is better to go to the house of mourning than to go to the
house of feasting; for that is the end of all men; and the living will
lay it to his heart.

*Response by all the Brethren*. So mote it be.

<span id="page_327">p. 327</span>

Then may be sung the following or some other appropriate HYMN:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Here Death his sacred seal hath set,  
  On bright and bygone hours;  
The dead we mourn are with us yet,  
  And—more than ever—ours!

Ours, by the pledge of love and faith;  
  By hopes of heaven on high;  
By trust, triumphant over death,  
  In immortality!

The dead are like the stars by day,  
  Withdrawn from mortal eye;  
Yet holding unperceived their way  
  Through the unclouded sky.

</div>

<span id="page_328">p. 328</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">By them, through holy hope and love,  
  We feel, in hours serene,  
Connected with the Lodge above.  
  Immortal and unseen.</span>

</div>

The MASTER or CHAPLAIN will repeat the following or some other
appropriate PRAYER:

MOST GLORIOUS GOD! author of all good, and giver of all mercy! pour down
thy blessings upon us, and strengthen our solemn engagements with the
ties of sincere affection! May the present instance of mortality remind
us of our approaching fate, and draw our attention toward thee, the only
refuge in time of need! that when the awful moment shall arrive, that we
are about to quit this transitory scene, the enlivening prospect of thy
mercy may dispel the gloom of death; and after our departure hence in
peace and in thy favor, we may be received into thine everlasting
kingdom, to enjoy, in union with the souls of our departed friends, the
just reward of a pious and virtuous life.

*Response*. So mote it be.

If the remains of the deceased are to be removed to a distance where the
brethren cannot follow to perform the ceremonies at the grave, the
procession will return to the Lodge-room or disperse, as most
convenient.
