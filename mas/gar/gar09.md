### QUALIFICATIONS OF CANDIDATES.

THE qualifications which are essential in those who apply for initiation
into the mysteries of Freemasonry, are of two kinds, *Internal* and
*External*, <span id="fr_4"></span>[\*](#fn_4.md)

<span id="page_19">p. 19</span>

The Internal qualifications of a candidate are those which lie within
his own bosom, and are not known to the world. They refer to his
peculiar dispositions toward the institution: his motives and design in
seeking an entrance into it. Hence they are known to himself alone; and
a knowledge of them can only be acquired from his own solemn
declarations.

The External qualifications are those which refer to his outward fitness
for initiation, and are based on his moral and religious character, the
frame of his body, the constitution of his mind, and his social
position. A knowledge of these is to be acquired from a careful
examination by a committee appointed for that purpose.

The person who desires to be made a Mason must be a man, believing in
the existence of a Supreme Being and of a future existence; at least
twenty-one years of age; of good moral character, temperate,
industrious, and capable of earning an honest livelihood; he must come
of his own free-will and accord, uninfluenced by mercenary or other
improper motives; be of sound mind and body; capable of reading and
writing; not deformed or dismembered, but hale and sound in his physical
conformation, having his right limbs, as a man ought to have.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_4"></span>[18:\*](gar09.htm#fr_4.md) It is true that the
ritual of the first degree says, that "it is the internal and not the
external qualifications which recommend a man to be made a Mason;" but
the context of the sentence shows that the external qualifications there
referred to are "worldly wealth and honors." The ritual, therefore, has
of course no allusion to the sort of external qualifications which are
here to he discussed.
