### GOVERNMENT OF THE FRATERNITY.

THE mode of government observed by the Fraternity will give the best
idea of the nature and design of the Masonic Institution.

Three classes are established among Masons, under different
appellations. The privileges of each class are distinct; and particular
means are adopted to preserve those privileges to the just and
meritorious. Honor and probity are recommendations to the First Class;
in which the practice of virtue is enforced, and the duties of morality
are inculcated; while the mind is prepared for a regular progress in the
principles of knowledge and philosophy. Diligence, assiduity, and
application, are qualifications for the Second Class; in which is given
an accurate elucidation of science, both in theory end practice. Here
human reason is cultivated by a due

exertion of the intellectual powers and faculties; nice and difficult
theories are explained; new discoveries are produced, and those already
known beautifully embellished. The Third Class is restricted to a
selected few, whom truth and fidelity have distinguished, whom years and
experience have improved, and whom merit and abilities have entitled to
preferment. With them the ancient landmarks of the Order are preserved;
and from them we learn the necessary instructive lessons which dignify
the Art, and qualify the professors to illustrate its excellence and
utility.

Such is the established plan of the Masonic System. By this judicious
arrangement, true Friendship is cultivated among different ranks of men,
Hospitality promoted, Industry rewarded, and Ingenuity
encouraged.—PRESTON.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_3"></span>[16:\*](gar06.htm#fr_3.md) On this principle,
unfortunate captives in war, and sojourners, accident. ally east on a
distant shore, are particular objects of attention, and seldom fail to
experience indulgence from Masons; and it is very remarkable that there
is not an instance on record of a breach of fidelity, or of ingratitude,
where that indulgence has been liberally extended.
