REEMASONRY is a moral institution, established by virtuous men, with the
praiseworthy design of recalling to our remembrance the most sublime
TRUTHS in the midst of innocent and social pleasures,—founded On
LIBERALITY, BROTHERLY LOVE, and CHARITY. "It is a beautiful system of
MORALITY, vailed in allegory and illustrated by symbols." TRUTH is its
center—the point whence its radii diverge, direct its disciples to a
correct knowledge of the Great Architect of the Universe, and the moral
laws which he has ordained for their government. <span

A proper administration of the various ceremonies connected with the
Ritual of Freemasonry is of the highest importance, as these form the
distinctive peculiarity of the institution. In their nature, they are
simple; in their end, moral and instructive. They naturally excite a
high degree of curiosity in a newly-initiated Brother, and create an
earnest desire to investigate

their meaning, and to become acquainted with their object and design. It
requires, however, close application and untiring diligence to ascertain
the precise nature of every ceremony which our ancient brethren saw
reason to adopt in the formation of an exclusive system, which was to
pass through the world unconnected with the religion and politics of all
times, and of every people among whom it should flourish and increase.
In order to preserve our ceremonies from the hand of innovation, it is
essentially necessary that every officer should be thoroughly acquainted
with them, and that a firm determination should exist among the Craft to
admit no change. A few words here or there may not in themselves appear
of much consequence; yet, by frequent allowance, we become habituated to
them, and thus open the door to evils of more serious magnitude. There
is, there can be, no safety but in a rigid adherence to the ancient
ceremonies of the Order. These ceremonies and regulations are fixed by
rules similar to those. governing affairs in social life. Every
Freemason is required to bring his portion of good ideas, and contribute
to the perfecting of the ceremonies and symbols, and to the edification
of TRUTH, the universal and eternal temple, which will one day inclose
all humanity within its precincts.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_2"></span>[13:\*](gar05.htm#fr_2.md) To use the words of an
elegant writer, "Freemasonry is an institution, not, as the ignorant and
uninstructed vainly suppose, founded on unmeaning mystery, for the
encouragement of bacchanalian festivity and support of mere good.
fellowship; but an institution founded on eternal reason and truth,
whose deer basis is the civilization of mankind, and whose everlasting
glory is supported by those two mighty pillars—SCIENCE and MORALITY."
