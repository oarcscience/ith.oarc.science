#### SERVICE

###### FOR THE

#### CONSECRATION OF MASONIC CEMETERIES.

IF the grounds to be consecrated are the property of a particular Lodge,
this service should be conducted by the officers of that Lodge, which
should be opened in due form, at the usual place of meeting, and march
in procession to the Cemetery.

If several Lodges are interested, the exercises should be under the
supervision of the Grand Lodge.

The brethren, having arrived at the grounds, should be arranged in such
a manner as to inclose an open space, in the form of an *oblong square*.
The Grand Master, his Deputy, or the Master of the Lodge—as the case may
be—should stand in the East, looking toward the West.

*Grand Master*. Let the gates of the South and the West be guarded.

The Wardens take their respective positions.

*G. M.* Right Worshipful Grand Senior Warden, what is a Lodge?

*G. S. W.* A Lodge is the symbol of the world.

*G. M.* What are its dimensions?

*G. S. W.* It reaches from the North to the South, and from the East to
the West.

*G. M.* Hath it any limits?

<span id="page_376">p. 376</span>

*G. S. W.* None; it embraceth the region of stars above, the empire of
graves below, and the kingdoms of eternal silence.

*G. M.* You have said that the Lodge is a symbol of the world. As the
world then is, in one sense, a vast Lodge, what is the last and highest
duty which a Mason is called upon to discharge therein?

*G. S. W.* To watch by the bed of a sick and dying brother, to soothe
his last hours, to console and relieve his widow, protect his orphan
children, and provide a suitable resting-place for his mortal remains.

*G. M.* Even so; and beloved brethren, we are assembled to-day to
perform the last, but not the least part of this most sacred task. We
are here to consecrate these grounds, by solemn services, to a solemn
use. But feeling all our weakness and blindness, and knowing that our
unaided efforts must be unavailing, let us first implore the presence
and aid of him from whom alone light and strength can come.

#### PRAYER,

#### BY THE CHAPLAIN.

SUPREME ARCHITECT OF THE UNIVERSE! who, in all ages, hast presided over
the labors of our Fraternity, and whose benevolent and paternal care all
worthy • Masons have, in all times, recognized with tears of gratitude,
we approach thee now, in a spirit of filial reverence and trust, to
implore Thy presence and the abundance of thy benedictions upon the

<span id="page_377">p. 377</span>

solemn labors of the present hour. Knowing our weakness, we ask thee for
Strength. Conscious of our ignorance, we implore of thee Light. Sensible
of our frailties and imperfections, we pray that the Holy Spirit may
breathe upon our hearts, that they may bloom with the flowers of Virtue
and Charity, as the earth blooms beneath the genial influence of the
sunshine. And, finally, O God! we beseech thee to impart to us thy
Wisdom, that we may be guided into the ways of Truth, accomplish our
present undertaking in a manner acceptable to thee, and be prepared for
a higher service in thy Spiritual Temple above.—AMEN.

*Response*. So mote it be.

*G. M.* LORD, thou hast been our dwelling-place in all generations!

*Response*. And thy Mercy endureth forever.

*G. M.* Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever thou hadst
formed the earth and the world, even from everlasting to everlasting,
thou art GOD.

*Response*. And thy Mercy endureth forever.

*G. M.* Thou turnest man to destruction, and sayest, return ye children
of men.

*Response*. Yet thy Mercy endureth forever.

*G. M.* For a thousand years in thy sight are but as yesterday, when it
is past, and as a watch in the night.

*Response*. But thy Mercy endureth forever.

<span id="page_378">p. 378</span>

*G. M.* Thou earnest them away as a flood; they are as asleep; in the
morning they are like grass that groweth up.

*Response*. But thy Mercy endureth forever.

*G. M.* In the morning it flourisheth, and groweth up; in the evening it
is cut down, and withereth.

*Response*. But thy Mercy endureth forever.

*G. M.* For we are consumed by thine anger, and by thy wrath we are
troubled.

*Response*. But thy Mercy endureth forever.

*G. M.* Thou hast set our iniquities before thee our secret sins in the
light of thy countenance.

*Response*. But thy Mercy endureth forever.

*G. M.* For all our days are passed away in thy wrath; we spend our
years as a tale that is told.

*Response*. But thy Mercy endureth forever.

*G. M.* So teach us to number our days, that we may apply our hearts
unto Wisdom.

*Response*. For thy Mercy endureth forever.

*G. M.* O, satisfy us early with thy Mercy; that we may be glad and
rejoice all our days. *Response*. For thy Mercy endureth forever.

*G. M.* Make us glad according to the days wherein thou hast afflicted
us, and the years wherein we have seen evil.

*Response*. For thy Mercy endureth forever.

*G. M.* Let thy work appear unto thy servants, and thy glory unto their
children.

*Response*. For thy Mercy endureth forever.

<span id="page_379">p. 379</span>

*G. M.* And let the Beauty of the Lord our God be upon us; and establish
thou the work of our hands upon us; yea, the work of our hands,
establish thou it. And to the King, eternal, immortal, invisible, the
one only living and true God, be offered worship and praise.

*Response*. As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, world
without end. So mote it be.—AMEN.

#### HYMN.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

O God! who, when the world was young,  
  Didst walk in Eden's fragrant bowers,  
Where Adam, just created, sung  
  His grateful hymns ’mid trees and flowers  
Thy servants here, with reverence, bend,  
  As did the father of our race,  
Imploring thee thy grace to send,  
  And with thy glory fill this place.

O thou! who look’st with pitying eye,  
  On us who dwell ’mid death's alarms,  
And while we live, or when we die,  
  Dost fold us in thy loving arms;  
Here, where in death our loved ones sleep,  
  O let thy benedictions fall,  
And teach us, as their loss we weep,  
  That deathless Love embraceth all.

Here, let the weary find repose,  
  ’Mongst fragrant flowers and waving trees—  
Emblems, at once, of mortal woes,  
  And [everlasting](errata.htm#7.md) sympathies— <span id="page_380">p.
380</span>  
And grant, O God! that we may see  
  In Nature's swelling buds, and bloom,  
The Spirit's immortality  
  And final victory o’er the tomb.

</div>

*G. M.* Brethren: As our Masonic obligations enjoin upon us not only a
tender regard for all the interests of a brother while living, but also
an affectionate and honorable disposal of his remains, when the great
Master of Life has summoned him to his rest, these grounds have been
secured and set apart for that sacred purpose. And as Freemasonry is an
institution of symbols, and communicates its instructions through a
sublime system of emblems, it is eminently proper that a Masonic
Cemetery should be consecrated by ceremonies of a symbolical character.
It should also be adorned with trees and shrubs and flowers, which have
a symbolical meaning connected with such solemn uses. No artificial
monuments of iron, or brass, or stone, which we erect to preserve the
remembrance of the departed, can compare in efficiency or beauty with
those that Nature produces, and which, though subject to decay, are
perpetually renewed.

All parts of the universe are symbolic, each one of which was, no doubt,
designed by the Creator to reveal, and impress upon the mind, some
special idea or sentiment. The visible world is but the shadow or reflex
of the verities of the invisible, and between the seen and the unseen
there is a

<span id="page_381">p. 381</span>

mysterious relationship. The Spiritual is mourned in every visible
thing, underlies all forms, and reveals itself in every tree and flower.
Through all time, and among all peoples, have the prominent features of
the universe revealed the same thoughts to all earnest hearts. Ever has
the mountain been the symbol of power and durability; the oak of
firmness and confidence; the various evergreens of immortality; the
cypress of death; and the drooping elm, and weeping willow, of a
profound sorrow and an eternal sympathy. These emblems of Hope, and
Faith, and Immortality, of undying affection, and tender sympathy, and
everlasting love, are the appropriate decorations of a Masonic
burial-place:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Types, Truth selects, appropriate  
  Fair fading creatures of a day,  
Of human life to indicate  
  The fragile state and swift decay;  
Now in prosperity elate,  
  And then forever passed away;  
Bedecking thus the mortal cell,  
Our tale impressively they tell.  
And when the Spring's reviving breath  
  Wakes latent energies below,  
Leaves, buds and blossoms bursting forth,  
  With graceful life and beauty glow,  
Symbols of triumph over death,  
  The Resurrection hope they show;  
The Grave her tenants shall restore,  
And Death of victory boast no more.</span>

</div>

<span id="page_382">p. 382</span>

One reason why we have been accustomed to look with so much terror on
the grave is the dreadful gloom in which human inventions have shrouded
it. The funereal emblems and rites of the olden times, and of the
earlier periods of the Christian Church, were exceedingly beautiful and
hopeful. But for several centuries we appear to have lost much of the
deep and earnest faith of their ancestors—they have seemed to doubt
whether the idea of immortality be, indeed, a verity, and, under the
influence of a withering skepticism, have declared that the departed are
henceforth nothing to us, and we are nothing to them. Freemasonry
rebukes and repudiates such gloomy theories, so repulsive to the warm
affections of the heart. The Lodge has no limitations. It reaches
through all worlds. It embraces the visible world of men, and the
invisible world of spirits. It proclaims that friendship survives the
grave, that love is immortal, and that the Masonic ties of our great
Brotherhood are as perpetual as eternity. Freemasonry, therefore, would
throw no gloom around man's supreme hour, nor marshal an army of hideous
spectres around the beds of the dying, or the graves of the honored
dead. It would rather remove every gloomy token—take from the grave's
brink the briers and thorns of fear—and plant, in their place, the
flowers of hope, and trust, and love. It would rend from the sculptured
monuments which cover the dead the grim and spectral images of

<span id="page_383">p. 383</span>

despair, and engrave thereon the symbols of a Hope that burns more and
more brightly through the ages, and of a Love which even death cannot
destroy. It would quiet the fears of its children, and bring to their
hearts a calm and enduring Faith in the invisible, and an imperishable
trust in the Father of the world. It would so quicken that faith, that
it would penetrate the veil of eternity, and see the assembly of the
wise and good, who have illuminated the world by their labors, reyouthed
and clothed in immortal beauty, renewing and continuing the sweet
communions that commenced on earth.

To such a Faith and Hope, and under the inspiration of such a Love, let
this place be consecrated. Hither let us bear our brethren, who have
been stricken by the hand of death, and lay them to rest among the trees
and flowers. Here may they sleep in peace, where the murmurs of the
winds and trees will chant their eternal requiem, and the fairest
flowers affection's hand can plant will cover their graves with
perpetual bloom. And hither may we, who are yet permitted to dwell amid
the sorrows of mortality, come to meditate on the brevity of life, and
the vanity of all its pomp, and show, and pride—on our great obligations
and duties, and the glorious reward that awaits us when we are admitted
to the "Middle Chamber" of the Celestial Temple. There let us come to
hold communion with the spirits of our departed brothers who may be
slumbering in

<span id="page_384">p. 384</span>

these solemn shades. There is nothing more salutary, more humanizing to
the heart, or more strengthening to our virtue, than this frequent
communion with, and invocation of, the spirit of the dead. For we should
never forget that the bond of Freemasonry is a three-fold cord, over
which death even has no power—that our deceased brethren yet live; are
still working in the heavenly Lodges, and that they are yet bound to us,
and we to them, in the ties of an eternal friendship. "After life's
fitful fever, they, indeed, sleep well;" but the lives they have lived,
and the examples they have given to the world, can never perish. Let us
pray that by their virtue we may become more virtuous, and by their
wisdom more wise; that they may watch over as guardian geniuses, and
preserve us from all selfishness, irreverence, and injustice in thought,
word, and deed. Standing here, the awful and silent stars over our
heads; the solemn and silent graves beneath our feet, let us listen to
that warning voice which resounds from the regions beyond the stars, and
swells up from the realms of eternal silence. "Children of mortality,"
yet heirs to an endless life! remember that the great Destiny Book is
placed in your hands! Beware what you write therein; for every pencil
stroke, be it bright or dark, will be a beam of light, bearing into your
souls an exceeding peace, or a grim shadow, waving darkly through your
thoughts forever!

<span id="page_385">p. 385</span>

And, finally, let us labor faithfully and reverently in our several
vocations, true to all our duties to GOD and man, so that when we are,
called to close our labors on earth we may be prepared for admission to
the grand and solemn mysteries of the Land of Light.

#### PRAYER OF CONSECRATION,

#### BY THE CHAPLAIN.

O thou, who art the Creator, and Father, and Preserver of all men; who,
although clothed with immortal splendor, and dwelling in the high and
holy place, dost condescend to abide in the hearts of the humble and
contrite, we, thy servants, now draw near to thee, to supplicate thy
grace, and those benedictions which thou hast promised unto all such as
approach thee in a spirit of loving reverence, and child-like
confidence.

When we consider thy grandeur, and our own feebleness; when we cast our
eyes upward, to survey the shining heavens, where mighty constellations
are sweeping in brightness through their everlasting circles, and turn
our thoughts upon ourselves—frail worms of the dust—we are oppressed
with a deep sense of our insignificance and unworthiness, and in our
humility we exclaim, "What is man that thou art mindful of him? and the
sons of men that thou regardest them?" Yet, thanks to thee, Almighty
God, that notwithstanding our apparent nothingness,

<span id="page_386">p. 386</span>

thou hast given us minds which can soar to thee, and invested us with
the attributes of an immortal nature. Thou hast also made us capable of
acquiring that divine wisdom "which is brighter than the sun, and above
all the order of the stars,'' by which the soul is expanded to angelic
perfection, and imbued with the Life and Beauty of the heavenly world.

Almighty GOD, our Heavenly Father, who lookest with benignant eye upon
all men; who seest every tear of misery, and hearest the mourners cry,
we implore thee to impart thy grace, and the efficient consolations of
thy Spirit, to all such as are called to mourn. Soothe and comfort all
the bereaved, with that Faith which hath power to pierce the dark
mystery of the grave, and look upon the immortal glories beyond; and
that sublime Hope which with joyful tears contemplates a future reunion
of all who have been separated on earth, in a circle that death can
never more invade.

O thou, who art the GOD of the dead as well as of the living, we ask thy
blessing to rest upon us, who are here assembled, and upon the solemn
services in which we are engaged. This quiet spot, which we consecrate
to the departed, we commend to thy protection and care. May it be
sanctified by thy presence. May we recognize in this murmuring foliage
thy paternal voice, speaking to our hearts, in accents of tenderness and
love. And, grant,

<span id="page_387">p. 387</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> O God, that thy
holy angels, who watched by an ancient tomb, where suffering Virtue
found repose in death, may be permitted to spread their radiant wings
over this place of graves, and make it bright with the Light of an
immortal Hope. Here, guarded thus by heavenly watchers, may our loved
ones rest in peace, until the great day when, together with us, they
shall be called to the grand Convocation to receive the recompense for
faithful labors.

"Now unto Him who is able to keep us from falling and to present us
before the throne of his glory, with exceeding joy, be ascribed honor,
dominion, and power through all ages."—AMEN.

*Response*. As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, world
without end.—AMEN. So mote it be.

Here an appropriate piece of music should be played by a band, during
which the brethren should move in procession around the Cemetery, the
Grand Master in the meanwhile sprinkling the grounds with pure water.
The public grand honors are then given, which closes the ceremony.
