### ROYAL ARCH, OR SEVENTH DEGREE.

THE Royal Arch Degree seems not to have been known to what are called
*modern* Masons as late as about 1750. That portion of the old
Freemasons who met at the famous Apple-Tree Tavern, in 1717, and formed
the society upon somewhat new principles, that is, so far as to admit
into fellowship, indiscriminately, respectable individuals of all
professions, were denominated, by the non-adherents to this plan, modern
Masons. This affair caused the division of the Masonic Society into two
parties, which continued till 1813, nearly one hundred years. To the
rivalry occasioned by this schism, Masonry, it is presumed, is mainly
indebted for the great celebrity it has obtained in the world.

It appears that the non-conformists to this new scheme, who considered
themselves the orthodox party, by rummaging among the old records of the
Order, first discovered the Royal Arch Degree, which had probably lain
dormant for centuries; during which time, it would appear, the society
had been confined almost exclusively to operative masons; who continued
the ceremonies only of the apprentice, fellow-craft or journeyman, and
master mason, these being deemed appropriate to their occupation.

A society of Royal Arch Masons is called a Chapter, and not a Lodge, as
in the previous Degrees. All Chapters of Royal Arch Masons are
"dedicated to Zerubbabel," and the symbolic color of this Degree is
scarlet. The several Degrees of Mark Master, Present or Past Master, and
Most Excellent Master, are given only under the sanction of the Royal
Arch Chapter; and a Master Mason who applies for these Degrees usually
enters the Chapter also, and sometimes the four degrees are given at
once. If he takes the four, he is only balloted for once, viz.: in the
Mark Master's Degree. Candidates receiving this Degree are said to be
"exalted to the most sublime Degree of the Royal Arch."

It is a point of the Royal Arch Degree not to assist, or be

<span id="page_218">p. 218</span>

present, at the conferring of this Degree upon more or less than three
candidates at one time. If there are not three candidates present, one
or two companions, as the case may be, volunteer to represent
candidates, so as to make the requisite number, or a "team," as it is
technically styled, and accompany the candidate or candidates through
all the stages of exaltation.

At the destruction of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar, three Most Excellent
Masters were carried captives to Babylon, where they remained seventy
years, and were liberated by Cyrus, King of Persia. They returned to
Jerusalem to assist in rebuilding the Temple, after travelling over
rugged roads on foot. They arrived at the outer veil of the Tabernacle,
which was erected near the ruins of the Temple. This Tabernacle was an
oblong square, enclosed by four veils, or curtains, and divided into
separate apartments by four cross veils, including the west end veil or
entrance. The veils were parted in the centre, and guarded by four
guards, with drawn swords.

At the east end of the Tabernacle, Haggai, Joshua, and Zerubbabel
usually sat in grand council, to examine all who wished to be employed
in the noble and glorious work of rebuilding the Temple. Since that
time, every Chapter of Royal Arch Masons, if properly formed, represents
the Tabernacle erected by our ancient brethren, near the ruins of King
Solomon's Temple, and our engraving shows the interior arrangement of a
Chapter of the Royal Arch Degree. <span id="fr_74"></span>[1](#fn_74.md)
(See [Fig. 31](#img_22000)..md)

These three Most Excellent Masters, on their arrival, were introduced to
the Grand Council, and employed, furnished with tools, and directed to
commence their labors at the northeast corner of the ruins of the old
Temple, and to clear away and remove the rubbish, in order to lay the
foundation of the new. The Grand Council also gave them strict orders to
preserve whatever should fall in their way (such as specimens of ancient
architecture, &c.,) and bring it up for their inspection.

Among the discoveries made by the three Masters was a secret vault in
which they found treasures of great benefit to the craft, &c. The
ceremony of exalting companions to this Degree, is a recapitulation of
the adventures of these three Most Excellent Masters, and hence it is
that three candidates are necessary for an initiation.

<span id="page_219">p. 219</span>

The Grand Council consists of the Most Excellent High Priest, King, and
Holy Scribe. The High Priest is dressed in a white robe, with a
breastplate of cut glass, consisting of twelve pieces, an apron, and a
mitre. The king wears a scarlet robe, apron, and crown. The mitre and
crown are generally made of pasteboard; sometimes they are made of most
splendid materials, gold and silver velvet; but these are kept for
public occasions. The mitre has the words, "Holiness to the Lord," in
gold letters, across the forehead. The scribe wears a purple robe,
apron, and turban.

A Chapter of Royal Arch Masons consists of nine officers, as follows:

1\. High Priest, or Master. (Joshua.)

2\. King, or Senior Grand Warden. (Zerubbabel.)

3\. Scribe, or Junior Grand Warden. (Haggai.)

4\. Captain of the Host (as Marshal, or Master of Ceremonies). or Senior
Deacon.

5\. Principal Sojourner, who represents the Junior Deacon.

6\. Royal Arch Captain, who represents the Master Overseer.

7\. Grand Master of the Third Veil, or Senior Overseer.

8\. Grand Master of the Second Veil, or Junior Overseer.

9\. Grand Master of the First Veil.

In addition to these, three other officers are usually present, viz.,
Secretary, a Treasurer, and a Tyler, or sentinel.

The officers and companions of the Chapter being stationed as in the
engraving (see [Fig. 31](#img_22000).md), the High Priest proceeds to
business as follows:

High Priest--Companions, <span id="fr_75"></span>[1](#fn_75.md) I am about
to open a Chapter of Royal Arch Masons in this place, for the dispatch
of business, and will thank you for your attention and assistance. If
there is any person present who is not a companion Royal Arch Mason, he
is requested to retire from the room.

After waiting for any stranger or brother not of this degree to retire,
he gives one rap with the gavel, which brings up the Captain of the
Host.

High Priest--Companion Captain, the first care of congregated Masons?

<span id="page_221">p. 221</span>

Captain (placing the palm of his right hand to his forehead, as if to
shade his eyes.)--To see the Tabernacle duly guarded, Most Excellent.
(For this sign, see [Fig. 36](#img_25100)..md)

High Priest--Attend to that part of your duty, and inform the Guard that
we are about to open a Chapter of Royal Arch Masons in this place for
the dispatch of business; direct him to guard accordingly.

The Captain of the Host stations the Guard at the outside of the door,
gives him his orders, closes the door, and makes an alarm of three times
three (• • •  • • •  • • •) on the inside, to ascertain that the Guard
is on his post; the Guard answers by nine corresponding raps. The
Captain of the Host then gives one, and Guard does the same. The Captain
then returns to his post.

Captain (to High Priest.)--The Chapter is duly guarded, Most Excellent.

High Priest--How guarded?

Captain--By a companion of this Degree at the outer avenue, with a drawn
sword in his hand.

High Priest--His duty there?

Captain--To observe the approach of all cowans and eavesdroppers, and
see that none pass or repass but such as are duly qualified.

High Priest--Companions, we will be clothed.

The companions place the furniture of the Chapter in proper order,
clothe with their various jewels, robes, and badges of this Degree, and
draw aside the veils, which brings the hall into one apartment, and
resume their seats. The High Priest then gives two raps with the gavel,
which brings all the officers on their feet, while the following lecture
is given, or questions asked, by the High Priest, and answered by the
Captain of the Host.

High Priest--Companion Captain of the Host, are you a Royal Arch Mason?

Captain--I am, that I am.

High Priest--How shall I know you to be a Royal Arch Mason?

Captain--By three times three.

High Priest--Where were you made a Royal Arch Mason?

Captain--In a just and legally constituted Chapter of Royal Arch Masons,
consisting of Most Excellent High Priest, King and Scribe, Captain of
the Host, Principal Sojourner, Royal Arch Captain, and the three Grand
Masters of the veils, assembled in a room or place representing the
Tabernacle erected by our ancient brethren near the ruins of King
Solomon's Temple.

High Priest--Where is the High Priest stationed, and what are his
duties?

<span id="page_222">p. 222</span>

Captain--He is stationed in the sanctum sanctorum. His duty, with the
King and Scribe, is to sit in the Grand Council, to form plans, and give
directions to the workmen.

High Priest--The King's station and duty?

Captain--Station, at the right hand of the High Priest; duty, to aid him
by his advice and counsel, and in his absence to preside.

High Priest--The Scribe's station and duty?

Captain--Station, at the left hand of the High Priest; duty, to assist
him and the King in the discharge of their duties, and to preside in
their absence.

High Priest--The Captain of the Host's station and duty?

Captain--Station, at the right hand in front of Grand Council; duty, to
receive orders, and see them duly executed.

High Priest--The Principal Sojourner's station and duty?

Captain--Station, at the left hand in front of Grand Council; duty, to
bring the blind by a way that they know not; to lead them in paths they
have not known; to make darkness light before them, and crooked things
straight.

High Priest--The Royal Arch Captain's station and duty?

Captain--Station, at the inner veil, or entrance to the sanctum
sanctorum; duty, to guard the same, and see that none pass but such as
are duly qualified, and have the proper pass-words, and the signet of
truth.

High Priest--What is the color of his banner?

Captain--White, and is emblematical of that purity of heart and
rectitude of conduct which are essential to obtain admission into the
divine sanctum sanctorum above.

High Priest--The stations and duties of the three Grand Masters of the
veils?

Captain--Station, at the entrance of their respective veils; duty, to
guard the same, and see that none pass but such as are duly qualified,
and in possession of the proper pass-words and tokens.

High Priest--What are the colors of their banners?

Captain--That of the third, scarlet; which is emblematical of fervency
and zeal, and the appropriate color of the Royal Arch Degree. It
admonishes us to be fervent in the exercise of our devotions to God, and
zealous in our endeavors to promote the happiness of men. Of the second,
purple; which being produced by a due mixture of blue and scarlet, the
former of which is the characteristic color of the symbolic, or three
first Degrees, it teaches us to cultivate and improve that spirit of
harmony between the brethren of the symbolic Degrees and the companions
of the sublime Degrees, which should ever distinguish the members

<span id="page_223">p. 223</span>

of a society founded upon the principles of everlasting truth and
universal philanthropy. Of the first, blue; the peculiar color of the
three ancient, or symbolical Degrees. It is an emblem of universal
friendship and benevolence, and instructs us that in the mind of a Mason
those virtues should be as expansive as the blue arch of heaven itself.

High Priest--The Treasurer's station and duty?

Captain--Station, at the right hand in rear of the Captain of the Host;
his duty, to keep a just and regular account of all the property and
funds of the Chapter placed in his hands, and exhibit them to the
Chapter when called upon for that purpose.

High Priest--The Secretary's place in the Chapter?

Captain--Station, at the left in rear of the Principal Sojourner; his
duty, to issue the orders and notifications of his superior officers,
record the proceedings of the Chapter proper to be written, to receive
all moneys due the Chapter, and pay them over to the Treasurer.

High Priest--Guard's place and duty?

Captain--His station is at the outer avenue of the Chapter; his duty, to
guard against the approach of cowans and eaves-droppers, and suffer none
to pass or repass, but such as are duly qualified.

High Priest (addressing the Chapter.)--Companions, you will assemble
round the altar, for the purpose of assisting me in opening a Chapter of
Royal Arch Masons.

All the members present (except the Grand Council) approach the altar,
and, forming a circle, kneel, each upon his right knee. An opening in
the circle is left for the High Priest, the King, and the Scribe. The
High Priest rises and reads from the Second Epistle of Paul to the
Thessalonians, chap. iii., vs. 6 to 18:--

"Now we command you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ,
that ye withdraw yourselves from every brother that walketh disorderly,
and not after the tradition which ye have received of us. For yourselves
know how ye ought to follow us; for we behaved not ourselves disorderly
among you; neither did we eat any man's bread for naught; but wrought
with labor and travail night and day, that we might not be chargeable to
any of you; not because we have not power, but to make ourselves an
example unto you to follow us," &c.

After the reading, the High Priest, the King, and the Scribe approach
the altar and take their places in the circle, kneeling with the rest,
the King on the right, and the Scribe on the left of the High Priest.
Each one now crosses his arms and gives his right hand to his left-hand
companion, and his left hand to his right-hand companion. This
constitutes the living arch under

<span id="page_224">p. 224</span>

which the Grand Omnific Royal Arch Word must be given, but it must also
be given by three times three, as hereafter explained.

The High Priest now whispers in the King's ear the pass-word RABBONI.

The King whispers it to the companion on his right, and he to the next
one, and so on until it comes round to the Scribe, who whispers it to
the High Priest.

High Priest--The word is right.

The companions now all balance three times three with their arms; that
is, they raise their arms and let them fall upon their knees three times
in concert--after a short pause, three times more, and after another
pause, three times more. They then rise and give all the signs, from the
Entered Apprentice up to this Degree, after which they join in squads of
three for giving the Grand Omnific Royal Arch Word, as follows:

Each one takes hold with his right hand of the right wrist of his
companion on the left, and with his left hand takes hold of the left
wrist of his companion on the right. Each one then places his right foot
forward with the hollow in front, so that the toe touches the heel of
his companion on the right. This is called "three times three;" that is,
three right feet forming a triangle, three left hands forming a
triangle, and three right hands forming a triangle. In this position
each repeats the following:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

As we three did agree,  
In peace, love, and unity,  
The Sacred Word to keep,  
So we three do agree,  
In peace, love, and unity,  
The Sacred Word to search;  
Until we three,  
Or three such as we, shall agree  
To close this Royal Arch.

</div>

They then balance three times three, bringing the right band with some
violence down upon the left. The right hands are then raised above their
heads, and the words, Jah-buh-lun, Jehovah, G-o-d, <span
id="fr_76"></span>[1](#fn_76.md) are given at low breath, each companion
pronouncing the syllables or letters alternately, as follows:

</div>

After the word is thus given, the High Priest inquires if the word is
right.

Each squad replies that it is right.

The officers and companions resume their seats. The High Priest raps
three times with his gavel, the King repeats it, as also the Scribes;
this is done three times (• • •  • • •  • • •).

High Priest (rising.)--I now declare this Chapter of Royal Arch Masons
opened in due and ancient form; and I hereby forbid all improper conduct
whereby the peace and harmony of this Chapter may be disturbed, under no
less penalties than the by-laws, or a majority of the Chapter, may see
fit to inflict.

High Priest (to Captain of the Host.)--Companion Captain, please to
inform the Guard that the Chapter is open.

The Captain proceeds on this duty, while the Secretary reads the minutes
of the last meeting. Should there be any candidates to be balloted for,
this is the first business in order. If one or more candidates are
waiting without, the Principal Sojourner goes to the preparation-room to
get them ready. If there are not three of them, a companion or
companions volunteer to make the trio, as not less than three can
perform the ceremonies. The three take off their coats, when the
Principal Sojourner ties bandages over their eyes, and, taking a long
rope, coils it seven times round the body of each, leaving about three
feet slack between.

<span id="page_227">p. 227</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> He then proceeds
with them to the door of the Chapter and gives seven distinct knocks.

Captain (rising.)--There is an alarm at the door, Most Excellent.

High Priest--Attend to the cause of it, and see who comes there.

The Captain of the Host goes to the door and raps on it nine times. The
Principal Sojourner, outside, answers this by three times three, and
then gives one rap, which the Captain answers by one, and then partly
opens the door.

Captain--Who comes there?

Principal Sojourner--Three worthy brothers, who have been initiated,
passed, and raised to the sublime Degree of Master Masons, advanced to
the honorary Degree of Mark Master, presided as Master in the chair,
and, at the completion and dedication of the Temple, were received and
acknowledged Most Excellent Masters; and now wish for further light in
Masonry, by being exalted to the august sublime Degree of the Holy Royal
Arch.

Captain (to candidates.)--Is it of your own free-will and accord you
make this request?

First Candidate (prompted.)--It is.

Captain (to Principal Sojourner.)--Are they duly and truly prepared?

Principal Sojourner--They are.

Captain--Have they made suitable proficiency in the preceding Degrees?

Principal Sojourner--They have.

Captain--By what further right or benefit do they expect to gain
admission to this Chapter of Royal Arch Masons?

Principal Sojourner--By the benefit of a pass.

Captain--Have they that pass?

Principal Sojourner--They have it not; but I have it for them.

Captain--Advance and give it.

Principal Sojourner whispers in his ear the word RABBONI.

Captain--The word is right; you will wait a time, until the Most
Excellent High Priest be informed of their request, and his answer
returned.

The Captain of the Host closes the door, and returns to his Place in the
Chapter, gives the alarm, which is answered by the High Priest, who asks
the same questions, and receives the same answers from the Captain of
the Host, as were asked and given at the door.

High Priest--Since this is the case, you will let them enter this
Chapter of Royal Arch Masons, and be received under a giving Arch.

<span id="page_228">p. 228</span>

The Captain of the Host goes to the door, opens it, and says;

Captain--It is our Most Excellent High Priest's order, that the
candidates enter this Chapter of Royal Arch Masons, and be received
under a Living Arch.

Principal Sojourner (leading the candidates by the rope.)--Companions,
you will follow me. (Leads them in.) I will bring the blind by a way
they know not: I will lead them in paths they have not known; I will
make darkness light before them, and crooked things straight. These
things will I do unto them, and will 'not forsake them Stoop low,
brethren: he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.

Meantime the brethren, or companions of the Chapter, form two lines
facing each other, from the door to the centre of the room, and each one
takes hold and locks his fingers with those of his opposite companion.
As the candidates pass under this Living Arch, each couple place their
knuckles upon the necks and backs of the candidates, kneading them
pretty hard sometimes, and prostrating them on the floor. Thus they have
a good deal of difficulty in forcing their way through. When they do get
through, they are first conducted round the Chapter, and then to the
altar, where they must kneel to receive the obligation.

Principal Sojourner (to the candidates.)--Brethren, as you advance in
Masonry, your obligation becomes more binding. You are now kneeling at
the altar for the seventh time; and about to take a solemn oath, or
obligation, which, like your former obligations, is not to interfere
with the duty you owe to your country, or Maker. If you are willing to
proceed, you will repeat your Christian and surname, and say after me:

I, Peter Gabe, of my own free-will and accord, in presence of Almighty
God, and this Chapter of Royal Arch Masons, erected to God, and
dedicated to Zerubbabel, do hereby and hereon most solemnly and
sincerely promise and swear, in addition to my former obligations, that
I will not reveal the secrets of this Degree to any of an inferior
Degree, nor to any being in the known world, except it be to a true and
lawful Companion Royal Arch Mason, or within the body of a just and
legally constituted Chapter of such and never unto him, or them, whom I
shall hear so to be, but to him and them only whom I shall find so to
be, after strict trial and due examination, or lawful information given.

I furthermore promise and swear, that I will not wrong this Chapter of
Royal Arch Masons, or a companion of this Degree, out of the value of
any thing, myself, nor suffer it to be done by others, if in my power to
prevent it.

<span id="page_229">p. 229</span>

I furthermore promise and swear, that I will not reveal the key to the
ineffable characters of this Degree, nor retain it in my possession, but
will destroy it whenever it comes to my sight.

I furthermore promise and swear, that I will not speak the Grand Omnific
Royal Arch Word, which I shall hereafter receive, in any manner, except
in that in which I shall receive it, which will be in the presence of
three Companions Royal Arch Masons, myself making one of the number; and
then by three times three, under a Living Arch, and at low breath.

I furthermore promise and swear, that I will not be at the exaltation of
candidates in a clandestine Chapter, nor converse upon the secrets of
this Degree with a clandestine-made Mason, or with one who has been
expelled or suspended, while under that sentence.

I furthermore promise and swear, that I will not assist or be present at
the exaltation of a candidate to this Degree, who has not received the
Degrees of Entered Apprentice, Fellow Craft, Master Mason, Mark Master,
Past Master, and Most Excellent Master.

I furthermore promise and swear, that I will not be at the exaltation of
more nor less than three candidates at one and the same time.

I furthermore promise and swear, that I will not be at the forming or
opening of a Chapter of Royal Arch Masons unless there be present nine
Royal Arch Masons, myself making one of that number.

I furthermore promise and swear, that I will not speak evil of a
Companion Royal Arch Mason, behind his back nor before his face, but
will apprise him of all approaching danger, if in my power.

I furthermore promise and swear, that I will support the Constitution of
the General Grand Royal Arch Chapter of the United States of America;
together with that of the Grand Chapter of this State, under which this
Chapter is holden; that I will stand to and abide by all the by-laws,
rules, and regulations of this Chapter, or of any other Chapter of which
I may hereafter become a member.

I furthermore promise and swear, that I will answer and obey all due
signs and summonses handed, sent, or thrown to me from a Chapter of
Royal Arch Masons, or from a Companion royal Arch Mason, if within the
length of my cable-tow.

I furthermore promise and swear, that I will not strike a Companion
Royal Arch Mason, so as to drew his blood, in anger.

<span id="page_230">p. 230</span>

I furthermore promise and swear, that I will employ a Companion Royal
Arch Mason in preference to any other person of equal qualifications,

I furthermore promise and swear, that I will assist a Companion Royal
Arch Mason when I see him engaged in any difficulty, and will espouse
his cause so far as to extricate him from the same, whether he be right
or wrong.

I furthermore promise and swear, that I will keep all the secrets of a
Companion Royal Arch Mason (when communicated so me as such, or I
knowing them to be such), without exceptions.

I furthermore promise and swear, that I will be aiding and assisting all
poor and indigent Companions Royal Arch Masons, their widows and
orphans, wheresoever dispersed around the globe; they making application
to me as such, and I finding them worthy, and can do it without any
material injury to myself or family.

To all which I do most solemnly and sincerely promise and swear, with a
firm and steadfast resolution to keep and perform the same, without any
equivocation, mental reservation, or self-evasion of mind in me
whatever; binding myself under no less penalty, than to have my skull
smote off, and my brains exposed to the scorching rays of the meridian
sun, should I knowingly or wilfully violate or transgress any part of
this my solemn oath or obligation of a Royal Arch Mason. So help me God,
and keep me steadfast in the due performance of the same.

Principal Sojourner--Kiss the book seven times.

The candidate kisses the book as directed.

Principal Sojourner--Companions, you will arise and follow we. For
although you are obligated Royal Arch Masons, yet, as the secrets of
this Degree are of infinitely more importance than any that precede it,
it is necessary that you should travel through rough and rugged ways,
and pass through many trials, 'm testimony of your fidelity to the
Order, before you can be instructed in the more important secrets of
this Degree.

The candidates are conducted once around the Chapter, and then again
directed to kneel, while the Principal Sojourner reads the following
prayer:

Supreme and inscrutable Architect of universal Nature, who, by thine
Almighty word didst speak into being the stupendous arch of heaven, and,
for the instruction and pleasure of thy rational creatures, didst adorn
us with greater and lesser lights, thereby magnifying thy power, and
endearing thy goodness unto the sons of men, we humbly adore and worship
thine unspeakable perfection. We bless thee, that, when man had fallen
from his

<span id="page_231">p. 231</span>

innocence and his happiness, thou didst leave him the powers of
reasoning, and capacity of improvement and pleasure. We thank thee,
that, amid the pains and calamities of our present state, so many means
of refreshment and satisfaction are reserved to us, while travelling the
rugged path of life; especially would we, at this time, render thee our
thanksgiving and praise for the institution, as members of which we are
at this time assembled, and for all the pleasures we have derived from
it. We thank thee, that the few here assembled before thee have been
favored with new inducements, and been laid under new and stronger
obligations of virtue and holiness. May these obligations, O blessed
Father! have their full effect upon us. Teach us, we pray thee, the true
reverence of thy great, mighty, and terrible Name. Inspire us with a
firm and unshaken resolution in our virtuous pursuits. Give us grace
diligently to search thy word in the book of nature, wherein the duties
of our high vocation are inculcated with Divine authority. May the
solemnity of the ceremonies of our institution be duly impressed on our
minds, and have a happy and lasting effect on our lives! O Thou, who
didst aforetime appear unto thy servant Moses in a flame of fire out of
the midst of a bush, enkindle, we beseech thee, in each of our hearts, a
flame of devotion to thee, of love to each other, and of charity to all
mankind! May all thy miracles and mighty works fill us with thy dread,
and thy goodness impress us with a love of thy holy name! May holiness
to the Lord be engraven upon all our thoughts, words, and actions! May
the incense of piety ascend continually unto thee from the altar of our
hearts, and burn day and night, as a sacrifice of a sweet-smelling
savor, well-pleasing unto thee! And since sin has destroyed within us
the first temple of purity and innocence, may thy heavenly grace guide
and assist us in rebuilding a second temple of reformation, and may the
glory of this latter house be greater than the glory of the former!
Amen, so mote it be.

Principal Sojourner--Companions, arise and follow me.

He now conducts them once around the Chapter, during which time he reads
from the text-book the first six verses of the third chapter of
Exodus:--

"Now Moses kept the flock of Jethro his father-in-law, the priest of
Midian; and he led the flock to the back side of the desert, and came to
the mountain of God, even to Horeb. And the angel of the Lord appeared
unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush; and he looked,
and behold, the bush burned with fire, and the bush was not consumed."
&c.

The reading of these verses is so timed, that just when they

<span id="page_232">p. 232</span>

are finished the candidates have arrived in front of a representation of
the burning bush, placed in a corner of the Chapter; when the Principal
Sojourner directs them to halt, and slips up the bandages from their
eyes.

One of the members now personates the Deity, behind the bush, and calls
out, Moses! Moses!

Principal Sojourner (answering for candidates.)--Here I am.

Companion behind the bush--Draw not nigh hither: put off thy shoes from
off thy feet, for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground. I am
the God of thy fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the
God of Jacob.

Principal Sojourner directs the candidates to kneel, and he covers their
faces again, and then says--And Moses hid his face, for he was afraid to
look upon God.

Principal Sojourner (to candidates.)--Arise, and follow me.

He then leads them three times around the Chapter, during which time he
reads from the text-book 2 Chronicles, ch. xxxvi., vs. 11 to 20:

'Zedekiah was one-and-twenty years old when he began to reign, and he
reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. And he did that which was evil in the
sight of the Lord his God, and humbled not himself before Jeremiah the
prophet, speaking from the mouth of the Lord. And he also rebelled
against King Nebuchadnezzar, and stiffened his neck, and hardened his
heart from turning unto the Lord God of Israel. Moreover, all the chief
of the priests and the people transgressed very much, after all the
abominations of the heathen, and polluted the house of the Lord, which
he had hallowed in Jerusalem. And the Lord God of their fathers sent to
them by his messengers, because he had compassion on his people, and on
his dwelling-place. But they mocked the messengers of God, and despised
his Word, and misused his prophets, until the wrath of the Lord arose
against his people, till there was no remedy. Therefore he brought upon
them the King of the Chaldees, who slew their young men with the sword,
in the house of their sanctuary, and had no compassion upon young men or
maidens, old men, or him that stooped for age; he gave them all into his
hand. And all the vessels of the house of God, great and small, and the
treasures of the house of the Lord, and the treasures of the king, and
his princes; all these he brought to Babylon. And they burnt the house
of God, and brake down the wall of Jerusalem, and burnt all the palaces
thereof with fire, and destroyed all the goodly vessels thereof. And
them that had escaped from the sword carried he away to Babylon; where
they were servants to him and his sons, until the reign of the kingdom
of Persia."

<span id="page_233">p. 233</span>

When the Principal Sojourner arrives at that part of the above reading
which alludes to the Chaldees killing the young men with the sword, the
companions of the Chapter begin to make all sorts of queer and unearthly
noises, such as rolling cannon-balls on the floor, clashing old swords,
shouting, groaning, whistling, stamping, throwing down benches, &c. This
noise continues during the remainder of the reading, the object being to
represent the siege and destruction of Jerusalem. During this confusion
the three candidates are seized, thrown upon the floor, bound hand and
foot, and carried bodily into the preparation-room, when the door is
closed.

In a few minutes the companions begin to shout: "Hurra for the
captives!" repeating it several times.

Captain of the Host goes and opens the door, and says--Come forth! you
are at liberty to return! for Cyrus has issued his proclamation to build
a second Temple at Jerusalem.

Principal Sojourner (who is with the candidates.)--Will you read the
proclamation?

Captain of the Host reads the first three verses of the first chapter of
Ezra, as follows:

"Now in the first year of Cyrus, King of Persia, the Lord stirred up the
spirit of Cyrus, King of Persia, that he made a proclamation throughout
all his kingdom, and put it also in writing, saying:

### PROCLAMATION

"Thus saith Cyrus, King of Persia, the Lord God of heaven hath given me
all the kingdoms of the earth, and he hath charged me to build him an
house at Jerusalem, which is in Judah. Who is there among you of all his
people? His God be with him, and let him go up to Jerusalem, which is in
Judah, and build the house of the Lord God of Israel, which is in
Jerusalem."

Captain of the Host--What say you to the proclamation? Are you willing
to go up to Jerusalem?

Principal Sojourner (consulting candidates.)--Yes, we are willing to go,
but we have no pass-word whereby to make ourselves known to the brethren
when we get there. What shall we say to them?

Captain of the Host reads verses 13 and 14 of the third chapter of
Exodus:

"And Moses said unto God, Behold! when I come unto the children of
Israel, and shall say unto them, The God of your fathers hath sent me
unto you, end they shall say to me, What is his name? What shall I say
to them?

<span id="page_234">p. 234</span>

"And God said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and thus thou shalt say unto
the children of Israel, I AM hath sent me unto you."

We were directed to use the words, "I AM THAT I AM," as a pass-word.

Principal Sojourner--We will go up. Companions, you will follow me; our
password is, I AM THAT I AM.

As they enter the Chapter, they again pass under the Living Arch.

Principal Sojourner--Stoop low, brethren. He that humbleth himself shall
be exalted.

On one side of the hall or Chapter, the Living Arch is formed, as before
described; on the other side is what is called the rugged road. This is
generally made of blocks and logs of wood, old chairs, benches, &c.

The companions who form the Living Arch press harder on the candidates
each time they go through, and they now go through three times. While
passing through, the Principal Sojourner says:

Principal Sojourner--This is the way many great and good men have
travelled before you, never deeming it derogatory to their dignity to
level themselves with the fraternity. I have often travelled this road
from Babylon to Jerusalem, and generally find it rough and rugged.
However, I think I never saw it much smoother than it is at the present
time.

The candidates, after passing the Living Arch, stumble over the rugged
road, and arrive again at the entrance of the arch.

Principal Sojourner--Companions, here is a very difficult and dangerous
place ahead, which lies directly in our way. Before we attempt to pass
it, we must kneel down and pray. (Reads Psalm cxii. )

"Lord, I cry unto thee; make haste unto me; give ear unto my voice.

"Let my prayer be set forth before thee as incense, and the lifting up
of my hands as the evening sacrifice.

"Set a watch, O Lord, before my mouth; keep the door of my lips.

'Incline not my heart to any evil thing, to practice wicked works with
men that work iniquity.

"Let the righteous smite me; it shall be a kindness: and let him reprove
me; it shall be an excellent oil.

"Mine eyes are unto thee, O God the Lord: in thee is my trust; leave not
my soul destitute.

"Keep me from the snare which they have laid before me, and the gins of
the workers of iniquity.

<span id="page_235">p. 235</span>

"Let the wicked fall into their own nets, whilst that I withal escape."

The candidates rise and again pass under the Living Arch and over the
rugged road. They then kneel again.

Principal Sojourner--Let us pray. (Reads from text-book Psalm cxlii.)

"I cried unto the Lord with my voice; with my voice unto the Lord did I
make my supplication," &c.

They then pass round the third time as before, when the candidates again
kneel.

Principal Sojourner reads Psalm cxliii. from the text-book:

"Hear my prayer, O Lord, give ear to my supplications; in thy
faithfulness answer me, and in thy righteousness," &c.

Principal Sojourner--We have now arrived in sight of the ruins of the
old Temple, near the outer veil of the Tabernacle.

The veils are now pushed apart to admit the candidates, but as soon as
they enter, the veils are closed again, and the officers (except the
Principal Sojourner) take their seats.

Principal Sojourner makes an alarm by stamping nine times on the floor,
which brings out the Master from the First Veil. (See Note
 [O](dun10.htm#xref_O), Appendix..md)

Master of First Veil--Who comes there? Who dares approach this outer
Veil of our sacred Tabernacle? Who are you?

Principal Sojourner--Three weary travellers from Babylon.

Master of First Veil--What are your intentions?

Principal Sojourner--We have come to assist in the noble and glorious
work of rebuilding the house of the Lord, without the hope of fee or
reward. (See Note M, Appendix.)

Master of First Veil--How do you expect to enter here?

Principal Sojourner--By a pass-word that .we received in Babylon.

Master of First Veil--Give it to me.

Principal Sojourner--I AM THAT I AM.

Master of First .Veil--The pass is right. You have my per. mission to
enter.

The candidates now enter the First Veil, when the bandages are removed
from their eyes.

Master of First Veil--You surely could not have come thus far unless you
were three Most Excellent Masters; but farther You cannot go without my
words, sign, and word of exhortation. My words are Shem, Ham, and
Japhet; my sign is this (holding out a cane), in imitation of one given
by God to Moses, when he commanded him to cast his rod upon the ground
thus (casting down the cane), and it became a serpent; but putting forth

<span id="page_236">p. 236</span>

his hand and taking it up by the tail, it became a rod in his hand as
before. My word of exhortation is explanatory of this sign, and is to be
found in the writings of Moses, viz.: the first verses of the fourth
chapter of Exodus. (See Note  [N](dun10.htm#xref_N), Appendix..md)

"And the Lord said unto Moses, What is that in thy hand? And he said, A
rod. And the Lord said, Cast it on the ground; and he cast it, and it
became a serpent, and Moses fled from before it," &c.

VEIL.](img/23600.jpg.md)  
FIG. 33. SIGN OF THE MASTER OF THE FIRST VEIL.

Principal Sojourner--Companions, we have passed the first guard, and
will make an alarm at the Second Veil. (Stamps on the floor, as before.)

Master of Second Veil--Who comes there? Who dares approach this Second
Veil of our sacred Tabernacle?

Principal Sojourner--Three weary sojourners from Babylon, who have come
to assist in rebuilding the house of the Lord, without the hope of fee
or reward.

Master of Second Veil--How do you expect to enter the second Veil?

Principal Sojourner--By the words, sign, and word of exhortation of the
Master of the First Veil.

<span id="page_237">p. 237</span>

Master of Second Veil--Give them.

Principal Sojourner--Shem, Ham, and Japhet. (Gives the sign of casting
down a cane and taking it up by the end, as before explained.)

Master of Second Veil--They are right. You have my permission to enter
the Second Veil.

The candidates, led by the Principal Sojourner, pass in.

</div>

Master of Second Veil--Three Most Excellent Masters you Must have been,
or thus far you could not have come; but farther you cannot go without
my words, sign, and word of exhortation. My words are Shem, Japhet, and
Adoniram; my sign is this: (thrusting his hand in his bosom); it is in
imitation of one given by God to Moses, when He commanded him to thrust
his hand into his bosom, and, taking it out, it became as leprous as
snow. My word of exhortation is explanatory of this sign, and is found
in the writings of Moses, viz., fourth chapter of Exodus:

"And the Lord said unto Moses, Put now thine hand into thy

<span id="page_238">p. 238</span>

bosom. And he put his hand into his bosom; and when he took it out,
behold, his hand was leprous as snow," &c.

Principal Sojourner--Companions, we will pass on, and make an alarm at
the Third Veil. (Stamps nine times.)

Master of the Third Veil--Who comes there? Who dares approach this Third
Veil of our sacred Tabernacle?

Principal Sojourner--Three weary sojourners from Babylon, who have come
to assist in the rebuilding of the house of the Lord, without the hope
of fee or reward.

Master of Third Veil--How do you expect to enter?

Principal Sojourner--By the words, sign, and word of exhortation of the
Master of the Second Veil.

Master of Third Veil--Give them.

Principal Sojourner--Shem, Japhet, and Adoniram. (Thrusts his hand into
his bosom as Master of Second Veil had done.)

Master of Third Veil--They are right. You can enter the Third Veil.

The candidates enter.

Master of Third Veil (to candidates.)--Three Most Excellent Masters you
must have been, or thus far you could not have come. But you cannot go
farther without my words, signs, and word of exhortation. My words are,
Haggai, Joshua, and Zerubbabel. My sign is this: (holds out a tumbler of
water, and pours out a little on the floor.) It is in imitation of one
given by God to Moses, when he commanded him to pour water upon the dry
land, and it became blood. My word of exhortation is explanatory of this
sign, and is found in the writings of Moses, viz., the fourth chapter of
Exodus:

"And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe in the two former
signs, thou shalt take of the water of the river and pour it upon the
dry land; and the water shall become blood upon the dry land."

Master of Third Veil--I also present you with the Signet of Truth, which
is that of Zerubbabel. (Presents a triangular piece of metal, with
ZER-UBBA-BEL engraved on it.)

Principal Sojourner (to candidates.)--Companions, we have now passed the
Third Veil: let us make an alarm at the Fourth. (Stamps as before.)

Royal Arch Captain--Who comes there? Who dares approach the Fourth Veil
of our sacred Tabernacle, where incense burns, day and night, upon the
holy altar? Who are you, and what are your intentions?

Principal Sojourner--Three weary sojourners from Babylon, who have come
up thus far to aid and assist in the noble and

<span id="page_239">p. 239</span>

glorious work of rebuilding the house of the Lord, without the hope of
fee or reward.

Royal Arch Captain--How do you expect to enter this Fourth Veil of our
sacred Tabernacle?

Principal Sojourner--By the words, sign, and word of exhortation of the
Master of the Third Veil.

Royal Arch Captain--Give them.

Principal Sojourner--Haggai, Joshua, and Zerubbabel (Pours a little
water from a tumbler, or cup, upon the floor, foe the sign.)

Royal Arch Captain--They are right. You have my permission to enter the
Fourth Veil.

The Veils are now drawn aside, and the candidates enter amid a dazzling
light, and behold the High Priest, King, and Scribe sitting in Grand
Council. The light is usually made by igniting gum camphor in an urn
upon the altar

Royal Arch Captain--Three Most Excellent Masters you must have been, or
thus far you could not have come. I will present you to the Grand
Council. (Stamps his foot nine times.)

High Priest--Who comes here?

Principal Sojourner--Three weary sojourners from Babylon, who have come
up thus far to aid and assist in rebuilding the house of the Lord,
without the hope of fee or reward.

High Priest--Have you the signet of Zerubbabel?

Principal Sojourner--We have. (Presents the signet given him by Master
of Third Veil.)

High Priest takes it, and reads from the second chapter of Haggai:

"In that day will I take thee, O Zerubbabel, my servant, the son of
Shealtiel, saith the Lord, and will make thee a signet: for I have
chosen thee."

High Priest (to King, showing him the signet.)--Companion, are you
satisfied that this is the signet of Zerubbabel?

King (taking the signet, and scrutinizing it.)--I am satisfied. Most
Excellent, that it is.

High Priest (showing signet to Scribe.)--Companion Scribe, think you
this is the true signet of Zerubbabel?

Scribe (looking shrewdly at it.)--I am satisfied that it is. Most
Excellent.

High Priest (drawing signet across his forehead, in imitation of the
penalty, see [Fig. 36](#img_25100)..md)--Signet of Truth, and Holiness to
the Lord!

The King and the Scribe, each in turn, puts his hand to his forehead,
repeating--Holiness to the Lord.

High Priest (to candidates.)--It is the opinion of the Grand

<span id="page_240">p. 240</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Council, that you
have presented the true signet of Zerubbabel. But, owing to difficulties
having arisen from the introduction of strangers among the workmen, none
are allowed to undertake in the noble and glorious work, but the true
descendants of the twelve tribes. It is necessary you should be very
particular in tracing your genealogy. Who are you, and what are your
intentions?

Principal Sojourner--We are your own kindred, the descendants of those
noble families of Giblemites, who wrought so hard at the building of the
first Temple. We have been regularly initiated as Entered Apprentice
Masons, passed to the Degree of Fellow Craft, raised to the sublime
Degree of Master Mason, advanced to the honorary Degree of Mark Master,
presided as Master in the chair, and at the completion and dedication of
the Temple were acknowledged as Most Excellent Masters. We were present
at its destruction by Nebuchadnezzar, and by him were carried away
captives to Babylon; where we remained servants to him and his
successors until the reign of Cyrus, King of Persia, by whose
proclamation we were liberated, and have come up thus far to aid and
assist in the noble and glorious work of rebuilding the house of the
Lord, without the hope of fee or reward.

High Priest--Let the captives be unbound, and brought to light.
Companion King, I think we had better employ these sojourners. They look
like good hardy men; just such men as we want about the building. What
say you?

King--It is my opinion, Most Excellent, that they are very expert
workmen. I wish they might be examined.

High Priest--What is your opinion, Companion Scribe?

Scribe--If they can satisfy us they are Free Masons, I shall be in favor
of employing them immediately.

High Priest--You say you are entered Apprentice Masons. Satisfy the
Grand Council.

The three candidates give the signs of Entered Apprentice. (See Figs.
[1](dun02.htm#img_01600) and [2](dun02.htm#img_01700.md), pp.
[17](dun02.htm#page_17), [18](dun02.htm#page_18)..md)

High Priest (to King and Scribe.)--Companions, are you satisfied?

The King bows gracefully, and the Scribe answers, We are satisfied, Most
Excellent.

High Priest (to candidates.)--The Grand Council are satisfied that you
are Entered Apprentice Masons. Have you been advanced to the Fellow
Craft's Degree?

Candidates give the Fellow Craft signs (see Figs.
[3](dun02.htm#img_01701) and [4](dun02.htm#img_01702.md), [p.
17](dun02.htm#page_17).md), when the High Priest asks his companions of the
Grand Council if they are satisfied, as before, and then informs the

<span id="page_241">p. 241</span>

candidates that the Grand Council approves them as true Fellow Crafts,
&c.

The same questions and answers are given in like manner as to each
Degree, up to and including that of Most Excellent Master, and the
candidates give all the signs of those Degrees to the Grand Council in
detail.

High Priest (after consultation with the King and Scribe.)--Companions,
we are satisfied that you are three worthy Most Excellent Masters. As
such, we will employ you on the Temple. What part of the work will you
undertake?

Principal Sojourner--We will take any service, however servile or
dangerous, for the sake of forwarding so great and noble an undertaking.

High Priest (to Royal Arch Captain.)--You will furnish them with the
working tools, and direct them to repair to the northeast corner of the
ruins of the old Temple, with orders to remove the rubbish, preparatory
to laying the foundation of the new Temple. Advise them to carefully
preserve every thing of service to the craft that falls in their way,
and bring it to the Grand Council.

The candidates are presented, one with a pickaxe, one with a crow, and
the other with a shovel, which are generally made of wood, and kept for
the purpose in the Lodge or Chapter.

<span id="img_24100"></span> ![WORKING TOOLS OF A ROYAL ARCH
MASON.](img/24100.jpg.md)  
WORKING TOOLS OF A ROYAL ARCH MASON.

Principal Sojourner (to the candidates.)--Follow me.

Each candidate shoulders his working tools and follows the Principal
Sojourner, going single file to a corner of the room where a quantity of
blocks or bricks are scattered around. These they stir up a little, when
they come to a ring in a trap-door, which they pull up, and find it
shaped like a keystone of an arch. Each one examines it, and then looks
down the trap, when the Principal Sojourner suggests that it be at once
taken up to the Grand Council. He then leads the candidates back.

High Priest--Companion King, have you further business to lay before
this Grand Council?

King--I have nothing, Most Excellent.

<span id="page_242">p. 242</span>

High Priest (to Scribe.)--Have you any thing, worthy companion?

Scribe--I know of nothing, Most Excellent.

High Priest--I know of nothing, unless the workmen from the ruins have
articles for inspection. The workmen will please come forward and give
an account of their labors.

Principal Sojourner--Most Excellent, in pursuance of orders of this
Grand Council, we repaired to the ruins and commenced our labors. After
laboring several days, we discovered what seemed a rock, but on striking
it with a crow it gave a hollow sound, and upon closer examination we
discovered in it an iron ring, by help of which we succeeded in removing
it from its place, when we found it to be the keystone of an arch, and
through the aperture there appeared to be an immense vault, curiously
arched. We have brought this keystone up, that it may be examined by the
Grand Council.

High Priest--You will present it.

Principal Sojourner presents the keystone, or trap.

High Priest (looking closely at it.)--Companion King, this is a very
valuable discovery indeed. It must be a keystone of a Mark Master Mason.

King--I think that is the stone wrought by our Grand Master, Hiram
Abiff.

High Priest--What think you of it, Companion Scribe? Scribe--It is
undoubtedly the stone wrought by our Grand Master, Hiram Abiff.

High Priest (drawing the keystone across his forehead, and giving the
sign.)--The keystone of a Mark Master! Holiness to the Lord.

King and Scribe do and say the same.

High Priest (to candidates.)--This is a very valuable discovery indeed.
No doubt it will lead to some important treasure, of inestimable value
to the craft. Are you willing to pursue your labors, and endeavor to
penetrate this secret vault?

Principal Sojourner (after consulting candidates.)--We are, even to the
risk of our lives.

High Priest--Go; and may the God of your fathers be with you. Preserve
every thing that falls in your way.

The Principal Sojourner returns with the candidates to the place where
they lifted the trap, and they there consult together as to who shall
descend into the vault. One of the candidates agreeing to go, they put a
rope seven times around his body, leaving two long ends. <span
id="fr_78"></span>[1](#fn_78.md)

<span id="page_243">p. 243</span>

Principal Sojourner (to candidate who is about to descend.)--Companion,
it is necessary you should take a little precaution. Should you wish to
descend still lower, pull the rope in your left hand: if you wish to
ascend, pull that in your right hand.

Two companions take hold of each end of the rope, letting the candidate
down eight or ten feet, to another trap-door, where he finds three small
trying squares; and, giving the signal of ascending, is drawn up. <span
id="fr_79"></span>[1](#fn_79.md)

Each candidate taking a square, they repair to the Grand Council. As
they present themselves, the High Priest reads the following passage
from the fourth chapter of Zechariah:

"This is the word of the Lord unto Zerubbabel, saying, Not by might, nor
by power, but by my spirit. Who art thou, O great mountain? Before
Zerubbabel thou shalt become a plain, and he shall bring forth the
headstone thereof with shoutings, crying, Grace, grace unto it.
Moreover, the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, The hands of
Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house; his hands shall also
finish it; and thou shalt know that the Lord of hosts hath sent me unto
you. For who hath despised the day of small things? For they shall
rejoice, and shall see the plummet in the hand of Zerubbabel with those
seven."

High Priest (to the King.)--Companions, have you any further business
for the Grand Council?

King--I have nothing, Most Excellent.

High Priest (to Scribe.)--Have you any thing, worthy companion?

Scribe--Nothing, Most Excellent.

High Priest--I know of nothing, unless the workmen from the ruins have
something for our inspection.

Principal Sojourner--We have examined the secret vault, Most Excellent,
and here is what we have found in it. (Presenting the three trying
squares.)

High Priest (drawing one of the squares across his forehead.)

The jewels of our ancient Grand Masters, King Solomon, Hiram, King of
Tyre, and Hiram Abiff! Holiness to the Lord.

The King and the Scribe each take one and imitate the High Priest.

High Priest (to candidates.)--Are you willing to continue your labors,
and still further penetrate this secret vault?

<span id="page_244">p. 244</span>

Principal Sojourner--We are, even to the risk of our lives.

High Priest--Go; and may the God of your fathers be with you; and
remember that your labors shall not go unrewarded.

The Principal Sojourner leads the candidates back as before, and winds
the rope round one of them, who is let down the trap, still further down
than before, where he finds the Ark, when he gives the signal and is
drawn up

The party immediately return to the Grand Council, two of them carrying
the Ark, where they present themselves in the same manner as before, and
the High Priest directs them to come forward and give an account of
their labors.

Principal Sojourner--Most Excellent, in pursuance of your orders, we
repaired to the secret vault, and let down one of our companions. The
sun at this time was at its meridian height, the rays of which enabled
him to discover a small box, or chest, standing on a pedestal, curiously
wrought, and overlaid with gold. On discovering it, he involuntarily
found his hand raised in this position (giving the sign as shown in
[Fig. 36](#img_25100).md), to guard his eyes from the intense light and
heat reflected from it. The air becoming offensive, he gave the signal
for ascending, and was immediately drawn out. We have brought this chest
up for the examination of the Grand Council.

High Priest (looking with surprise at the Ark)--Companion King, this is
the Ark of the Covenant of God.

King (looking at it)--It is undoubtedly the true Ark of the Covenant,
Most Excellent.

Scribe (looking at the Ark)--That is also my opinion.

High Priest (taking the Ark)--Let us open it, and see what valuable
treasure it may contain. (Opens the Ark, and takes out a book.)

High Priest (to King)--Companion, here is a very ancient-looking book;
what can it be? Let us read in it. (Reads first three verses of first
chapter of Genesis:)

"In the beginning, God created the heaven and the earth," &c.

After reading these verses, the High Priest turns over to Deuteronomy
xxxi., and reads from the 24th to the 26th verses, as follows:

"And it came to pass, when Moses had made an end of writing the words of
this law in a book, until they were finished, that Moses commanded the
Levites, which bare the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord, saying, Take
this book of the law, and put it in the side of the Ark of the Covenant
of the Lord your God, that it may be there for a witness against thee."

The High Priest then turns back to Exodus xxv., and reads the 21st
verse, as follows:

<span id="page_245">p. 245</span>

<span id="page_246">p. 246</span>

"And thou shalt put the mercy-seat above upon the Ark; and in the Ark
thou shalt put the testimony that I shall give thee."

High Priest--This is a book of the law--long lost, but now found.
Holiness to the Lord. (He repeats this again, twice.)

King--A book of the law--long lost, but now found. Holiness to the Lord!

Scribe repeats the same.

High Priest (to candidates.)--You now see that the world is indebted to
Masonry for the preservation of this sacred volume. Had it not been for
the wisdom and precaution of our ancient brethren, this, the only
remaining copy of the law, would have been destroyed at the destruction
of Jerusalem. <span id="fr_80"></span>[1](#fn_80.md)

<span id="page_247">p. 247</span>

High Priest (taking a little pot out of the Ark.)--Companion King, what
can this be? a pot of manna? We will read in the book of the law, and
see what that says: (Reads, *Exodus* xvi. 32-34.)

"And Moses said, This is the thing which the Lord commandeth: Fill an
omer of the manna to be kept for your generations, that they may see the
bread wherewith I have fed you in the wilderness, when I brought you
forth from the land of Egypt. And Moses said unto Aaron, Take a pot, and
put an omer full of manna therein, and lay it up before the Lord, to be
kept for your generations. As the Lord commanded Moses, so Aaron laid it
up before the testimony, to be kept for a token."

High Priest--A Pot of Manna! Holiness to the Lord!

King--A Pot of Manna! Holiness to the Lord!

Scribe repeats the same.

High Priest--Companions, we read in the book of the law, that he that
overcometh, will I give to eat of the hidden manna. Come forward,
Companions, you are entitled to it. (Each one receives a small lump of
sugar.) But how it came deposited here, we cannot now particularly
speak. You must go higher in Masonry before you can know.

The High Priest looks again into the Ark, and finds a stick with some
buds upon it, which he shows to the King and Scribe, and after a
consultation, they decide that it is Aaron's Rod, and the fact is thus
proclaimed in the same manner as the discovery of the manna.

High Priest then reads the following passage, Numbers xvii. 10:

"And the Lord said unto Moses, Bring Aaron's rod again before the
testimony, to be kept for a token."

And also, Hebrews ix. 2-5:

"For there was a tabernacle made: the first, wherein was the
candlesticks, and the table, and the shew-bread, which is called the
sanctuary: and after the second veil, the tabernacle, which is called
the Holiest of all; which had the golden censer, and the ark of the
covenant, overlaid round about with gold; wherein was the golden pot
that had manna; and Aaron's rod, that budded, and the tables of the
covenant; and over it the cherubim of glory, shadowing the mercy seat;
of which we cannot now speak particularly."

Looking again into the Ark, the High Priest takes out four pieces of
paper, which he examines closely, consults with the

<span id="page_248">p. 248</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> King and Scribe,
and then puts together, so as to show a key to the ineffable characters
of this Degree:

<span id="img_24800"></span> ![KEY TO THE INEFFABLE
CHARACTERS.](img/24800.jpg.md)  
KEY TO THE INEFFABLE CHARACTERS.

The key to the ineffable characters, or Royal Arch Cipher, alluded to
above, consists of right angles, in various situations, with the
addition of a dot. By transposition, it forms twenty-six distinct
characters, corresponding with the twenty-six letters of the English
alphabet. There are two methods of combining these characters for secret
correspondence: One method is to call the first sign, <span
id="img_24801"></span> ![](img/24801.jpg), *a*; the second, <span
id="img_24802"></span> ![](img/24802.jpg), *b*; the third, <span
id="img_24803"></span> ![](img/24803.jpg), *c*; and so on, reading from
left to right, thus:

<span id="img_24804"></span> ![Masonic Cryptogram 1](img/24804.jpg.md)

The second way to read the alphabet is as follows:

<span id="img_24805"></span> ![Masonic Cryptogram 2](img/24805.jpg.md)

The upper left angle without a dot is *a*; the same with a dot is *b*,
&c.

High Priest then reads Exodus vi. 2, 3:

"And God spake unto Moses, and said unto him, I am the Lord: and I
appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, by the name of God
Almighty; but by my name Jehovah was I not known to them."

<span id="page_249">p. 249</span>

After examining the Key, he proceeds to read, by the aid of it, the
characters on the four sides of the Ark.

High Priest (reading first side.)--Deposited in the year three thousand.
Second side--By Solomon, King of Israel. Third side--Hiram, King of
Tyre, and Hiram Abiff. Fourth side--For the good of Masonry, generally,
but the Jewish nation in particular. <span id="fr_81"></span>[1](#fn_81.md)

High Priest (to candidates.)--Companions, here are three mysterious
words, in a triangular form, upon the Ark, which, when first found, were
covered with three squares, the jewels of our three ancient Grand
Masters; and from this circumstance, we supposed it to be the long-lost
Master Mason's word; and, on applying our Key to it, it proved our
suspicions to be correct. It is the name of Deity in three languages,
viz., Chaldaic, Hebrew, and Syriac, which is the long-lost Master
Mason's word, or Logos, and has now become the Grand Omnific Royal Arch
word.

It is the divine Logos, or Word, to which reference is had in John (i.
1-5):

"In the beginning was the word (Logos), and the word was with God, and
the word was God; the same was in the beginning with God: all things
were made by him, and without him was not any thing made that was made;
in him was life, and the life was the light of men: and the light
shineth in darkness, and the darkness comprehended it not."

This word was anciently written only in these sacred characters, and
thus preserved from one generation to another. It was lost by the death
of Hiram Abiff, was found again at the building of the Temple, and will
now be given to you; and you will re-member the manner you receive it,
and that you have sworn never to give it to others except in that
particular manner.

The candidates, instructed by the Principal Sojourner, now learn the
Grand Omnific Royal Arch Word, as follows:

Each one takes hold with his right hand of the right wrist of his
companion on the left, and with his left hand takes hold of the left
wrist of his companion on the right. Each one then

<span id="page_250">p. 250</span>

places his right foot forward with the hollow in front, so that the toe
touches the heel of his companion on the right. This is called "three
times three;" that is, three right feet forming a triangle, three left
hands forming a triangle, and three right hands forming a triangle. They
balance in the same manner, and then, with hands raised, repeat the
words Jah-buh-lun, Jehovah, G-o-d, at low breath, as described before.
(See pp. [224](#page_224)-25, [Fig. 32](#img_22500)..md) <span
id="fr_82"></span>[1](#fn_82.md)

<span id="page_251">p. 251</span>

The signs of this Degree are now given to the candidates, as follows:

First, raise the right hand to the forehead, the hand and arm
horizontal, the thumb toward the forehead; draw it briskly across the
forehead, and drop it perpendicularly by the side. This constitutes the
duegard and sign of this Degree, and refers not only to the penalty of
the obligation, but alludes also to the manner in which the brother who
descended into the vault, and found the Ark, found his hands
involuntarily placed, to protect

his head from the rays of the meridian sun. (See [Fig. 36](#img_25100)..md)
This sign must be given to the High Priest, upon entering and retiring
from a Chapter.

High Priest (placing crowns upon the heads of candidates.)--Companions,
you are now invested with all the important secrets

<span id="page_252">p. 252</span>

of this Degree, and crowned and received as worthy Companions Royal Arch
Masons.

The High Priest then reads to them from a book the charge in this
Degree, informing them that the Degree owes its origin to Zerubbabel and
his associates, who rebuilt the Temple by order of Cyrus, King of
Persia. He likewise informs them that the discovery of the secret vault
and the inestimable treasures, with the long-lost word, actually took
place in the manner represented in conferring this Degree, and that it
is the circumstance upon which the Degree is principally founded.

The initiation being over, the High Priest begins the closing lecture,
which is a repetition, by questions and answers, of the opening of a
Chapter, and the advancement of a companion of this Degree. It begins as
follows:

High Priest (to Captain of the Host.)--Are you a Royal Arch Mason?

Captain--I am that I am.

High Priest--How shall I know you to be a Royal Arch Mason? Captain of
Host--By three times three.

High Priest--Where were you made a Royal Arch Mason?

Captain of the Host--In a just and legally constituted Chapter of Royal
Arch Masons, consisting of Most Excellent High Priest, King and Scribe,
Captain of the Host, Principal Sojourner, Royal Arch Captain, and the
three Grand Masters of the Veils, assembled in a room or place
representing the Tabernacle erected by our ancient brethren, near the
ruins of King Solomon's Temple.

The High Priest continues his questions as to the station and duties of
each officer of the Chapter, and every particular relative to the
organization thereof, the initiation or advancement of candidates, &c.
The Captain of the Host rehearses or describes  the whole precisely as
we have given it. These closing lectures are intended to perfect members
in the full understanding of each Degree.

After the lecture, the Chapter is closed in the same manner as the
opening, up to the raising of the Living Arch. The companions join hands
by threes, in the same manner, and say in concert:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

As we three did agree  
  The Sacred Word to keep--  
As we three did agree  
  The Sacred Word to search;  
So we three do agree  
  To close this Royal Arch.

</div>

<span id="page_253">p. 253</span>

They then break, and the High Priest reads the following prayer:

"By the wisdom of the Supreme High Priest may we be directed, by his
strength may we be enabled, and by the beauty of virtue may we be
incited to perform the obligations here enjoined upon us, to keep
inviolable the mysteries here unfolded to us, and invariably to practise
all those duties out of the Chapter which are inculcated in it."

Companions--So mote it be. Amen.

High Priest--I now declare this Chapter of Royal Arch Masons
closed. <span id="fr_84"></span>[1](#fn_84.md)

It is generally conceded by Masonic writers, that ancient Masonry closes
with the Royal Arch. In an edition of "The Illustrations of Masonry," by
Mr. Preston, published in London, 1829, the editor, Mr. Oliver,
observes:

"All Degrees beyond the Royal Arch ought to be carefully separated from
genuine Masonry, as they are mostly founded on vague and uncertain
traditions, which possess not the shadow of authority to recommend them
to our notice." <span id="fr_85"></span>[2](#fn_85.md)

<span id="page_254">p. 254</span>

The additional Degrees, including those considered legitimate, amount to
upward of fifty. These are founded partly upon astronomical principles,
agreeing with the ancient worship of the Egyptians, and partly upon the
Hebrew and Christian doctrines.

It may be remarked in general, that many of the degrees of knights are
founded on the Christian knighthoods got up in the time of the Crusades,
in the twelfth century; and that the ceremonies thereof are an imitation
of those superstitious establishments. A former Grand High Priest of the
Chapters in the State of New York informs me, that he initiated a French
gentleman into the Degree of Knight of Malta, who told him he was a
member of the ancient order of that name, and that the ceremonies were
very similar.

At the time those old knighthoods were founded, "superstition mingled in
every public and private action of life; in the holy wars it sanctified
the profession of arms; and the order of chivalry was assimilated in its
rights and privileges to the sacred orders of priesthood. The bath and
the white garment of the novice were an Indecent copy of the
regeneration of baptism; his sword, which he offered on the altar, was
blessed by the ministers of religion; his solemn reception was preceded
by fasts and vigils; and he was created a knight in the name of God, of
St. George, and of St. Michael the archangel."--*Rees's Cycl*.

The emblem of the Royal Arch Degree is called the *Triple Tau*, and is a
figure consisting of three tau crosses. It was adopted at Chicago, 1859,
by the General Grand Chapter of the United States, and is worn printed
on all aprons of the Royal Arch Degree.

### LECTURE ON THE SEVENTH, OR LOYAL ARCH DEGREE.--SECTION FIRST.

*Question*. Are you a Royal Arch Mason?

*Answer*. I am that I am.

Q. How shall I know you to be a Royal Arch Mason? A. By three times
three.

Q. Where were you exalted to the most sublime Degree of a Royal Arch
Mason?

<span id="page_255">p. 255</span>

A. In a regularly and duly constituted Chapter of Royal Arch Masons
assembled in a place representing a Tabernacle, erected by our ancient
brethren near the ruins of King Solomon's temple.

Q. How many constitute a Chapter of Royal Arch Masons?

A. Nine Regular Royal Arch Masons--consisting of Most Excellent High
Priest, Excellent King, and Scribe, Captain of the Host, Principal
Sojourner, Royal Arch Captain, and three Masters of the veils.

Q. Who do the three former represent?

A. Those of our ancient brethren who formed the first Most Grand Council
at Jerusalem, and held their meetings in a tabernacle.

Q. Who did the three latter represent?

A. Those of our ancient brethren, who directed and brought to light the
principal secrets of this Degree, after they had lain buried in darkness
from the death of our Grand Master Hiram Abiff, until the erection of
the second temple, and as a reward for their zeal, fortitude and
attachment to Masonry, were exalted to become the three Grand Masters of
the veils.

Q. How many veils were they?

A. Four.

Q. What were their colors?

A. Blue, purple, scarlet and white.

Q. What does blue denote?

A. Friendship, and is the principal color of a Master Mason.

Q. What does purple denote?

A. It being composed of blue and scarlet, it is placed before the first
and third veils of the colors, to denote the intimate connection between
this most sublime degree, and ancient Craft Masonry.

Q. What does scarlet denote?

A. That fervency and zeal which should actuate all Royal Arch Masons,
and is the peculiar color of this Degree.

Q. What does white denote?

A. That purity of life and rectitude of conduct which should govern all
those who seek to gain admission into that Sanctum Sanctorum, or Holy of
Holies.

Q. To whom do the four veils allude?

A. To the four tribes of the children of Israel, who bore the banners
through the wilderness, viz.: Judah, Reuben, Ephraim and Dan,
emblematically represented by the strength of the Lion, the intelligence
of the Man, the patience of the Ox and the swiftness of the Eagle.

Q. Where were the veils placed?

A. At the outer courts of the tabernacle.

<span id="page_256">p. 256</span>

Q. Why there?

A. To serve as a covering for the tabernacle and stations for the
guards.

Q. Why were guards stationed there?

A. To take special pains that none pass or repass, except such as were
duly qualified, as none were permitted to enter the presence of the Most
Excellent High Priest, Excellent King, and Scribe, except the true
descendants of the twelve (12) tribes of the children of Israel.

Q. How did the children of Israel make themselves known to the several
guards?

A. By the same words and signs given by God to Moses. He was commanded
to conduct the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt from the
bands of bondage.

### SECOND SECTION.

Q. Where were you prepared to be exalted to the Most Sublime degree of a
Royal Arch Mason?

A. In a room adjoining a regular and duly constituted Chapter of Royal
Arch Masons.

Q. How were you prepared.

A. I was divested of my outward apparel, in a working posture,
hoodwinked, and a cable tow seven times around my body, accompanied by
two (2) brethren possessed of like qualifications, in which condition we
were conducted to the door of the Chapter, where a regular demand was
made by seven (7) distinct knocks.

Q. To what do the seven (7) distinct knocks allude?

A. To the seventh Degree of Masonry, it being that upon which I was
about to enter.

Q. What was said to you from within?

A. Who comes here?

Q. Your answer?

A. Three worthy brothers (or brethren) who have been duly initiated,
passed to the Degree of Fellow Craft, raised to the Sublime Degree of
Master Mason, advanced to the Degree of Mark Master Mason, regularly
passed the Chair--have been received and acknowledged as Most Excellent
Masters, and now wish further promotion in Masonry, by being exalted to
the Most Sublime Degree of a Royal Arch Mason.

Q. What were you then asked?

A. If it was an act of my own free will and accord, if I was worthy and
well qualified, duly and truly prepared, if I had made suitable
proficiencies in the preceding Degree, and was properly vouched for--all
of which being answered in the affirmative,

<span id="page_257">p. 257</span>

I was asked by what further right or benefit I expected to obtain this
important privilege.

Q. Your answer?

A. By the benefit of the pass.

Q. Give the pass?

A. Rabboni.

Q. What does it signify?

A. Good Master, or Most Excellent Master.

Q. What was then said to you?

A. We were directed to wait until the Captain of the Host could be
informed of our request, and his answer returned.

Q. What was his answer when returned?

A. Let the candidates enter and be received in due and ancient form.

Q. How were you received in a Chapter of Royal Arch Masons?

A. Under a living arch.

Q. Why under a living arch?

A. To imprint upon my mind in the most solemn manner that the principal
secrets of this Degree should be communicated only under a living arch.

Q. How were you then disposed of?

A. We were conducted once around the outer courts of the tabernacle,
there caused to kneel at the altar and invoke a blessing from Deity.

Q. After invoking a blessing from Deity, how were you then disposed of?

A. We were again conducted around the outer courts of the tabernacle,
where we were met by the Captain of the Host, who demanded of us who
comes here, and what were our intentions.

Q. Your answer?

A. As at the door.

Q. Of what did the Captain of the Host inform you?

A. Treat in pursuing our intentions, we should be under the disagreeable
necessity of travelling those rough and rugged paths, which all Royal
Arch Masons have done before us, but before pursuing further it would be
necessary for us to kneel at the altar in due form, and take upon
ourselves the solemn oath or obligation of a Royal Arch Mason.

Q. What was that due form?

A. Kneeling upon both knees, both hands covering the Holy Bible, square
and compasses, in which due form I took upon myself the solemn oath or
obligation of a Royal Arch Mason.

Q. Have you that oath?

<span id="page_258">p. 258</span>

A. I have.

Q. Will you give it?

A. I will with your assistance.

Q. Proceed. (I, A. B., etc., etc.)

Q. After the oath how were you then disposed of?

A. We were again conducted around the outer courts of the tabernacle,
where was exhibited the symbol of the burning bush.

Q. Why was the symbol of the burning bush exhibited to you at this point
of your exaltation?

A. To impress upon my mind in the most solemn manner, that the words and
signs following were of divine origin, and as such were regarded sacred
by the children of Israel--by them transmitted to their posterity, as
words and signs by which they should make themselves known and be
distinguished by each other for ever after.

Q. How were you then disposed of?

A. We were again conducted around the outer courts of the tabernacle,
where a representation of the destruction of the temple took place.

Q. By whom was it destroyed?

A. By Nebuchadnezzar, King of Babylon, who in the eleventh year of
Zedekiah, King of Jerusalem, went up, beseiged and took the city, seized
on all the holy vessels, together with the two brazen pillars; and the
remnant of the people who escaped the sword, he carried away captives to
Babylon.

Q. What was the period of their captivity?

A. Seventy (70) years.

Q. By whom were they delivered?

A. By Cyrus, King of Persia, who in the first year of his reign issued
his yearly proclamation saying: "Thus says Cyrus, King of Persia," etc.,
etc. (See Monitor.)

Q. Who did you then represent?

A. Those of our ancient brethren being released from their captivity.

Q. In that case what answer did you make Cyrus, King of Persia?

A. But behold when I come unto the children of Israel, etc., etc.
(Monitorial.)

Q. What answer did you receive from the Captain of the Host?

A. I am that I am, I am hath sent me unto you.

Q. Did you pursue your journey?

A. We did, the rough and rugged paths.

Q. What do the rough and rugged paths denote?

<span id="page_259">p. 259</span>

A. The sojourning of the children of Israel through the wilderness.

Q. Did you meet with any obstructions?

A. We did, several.

Q. Where did you meet with the first obstruction?

A. At the first veil, where on making the regular demand, we heard the
Master of that veil exclaim, "Who dares approach this first veil of our
sacred tabernacle?" and he, supposing an enemy to be approaching, hailed
his companions, who on being assembled demanded, "Who comes here?"

Q. Your answer?

A. We are of your own brethren and kin--children of the
captivity--descendants of those noble Giblemites, we were received and
acknowledged Most Excellent Masters at the completion and dedication of
the first temple--were present at the destruction of that temple by
Nebuchadnezzar, by whom we were carried captives to Babylon, where we
remained servants to him and his successors, until the reign of Cyrus,
King of Persia, by whose order we have been liberated, and have now come
up to help, aid, and assist in rebuilding the house of the Lord, without
the hope of fee or reward.

Q. What were you then asked?

A. By what further reward or benefit we expected to obtain this
important privilege.

Q. Your answer?

A. By the benefit of the pass.

Q. Give it? (I am that I am, I am hath sent me unto you.)

Q. Did this give you admission?

A. It did within the first veil.

Q. What was then said to you?

A. Good men and true you must have been, to have come thus far to
promote so noble and good an undertaking; but further you cannot go
without my word, sign, and word of explanation.

Q. What was the word of the Master of the first veil?

A. I am that I am, I am hath sent you unto us, Shem, Ham, and Japheth.

Q. What is his sign?

A. It is in imitation of that given by God to Moses when he was
commanded to cast his rod upon the ground, and it be-came a serpent.

Q. What was his word of explanation?

A. It was explanatory of the sign as recorded by Moses, and is as
follows. "And Moses answered and said, But behold they will not believe
me, nor hearken unto my voice, for they will say,

<span id="page_260">p. 260</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> The Lord hath not
appeared unto thee; and the Lord said unto him, What is that in thine
hand, and he said, A rod; and He said, Cast it on the ground. And he
cast it on the ground and it became a serpent, and Moses fled from
before it; and the Lord said, Put forth thine hand and take it by the
tail; and he put forth his hand and caught it, and it become a rod in
his hand, that they may believe that the God of their fathers, the God
of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob hath appeared unto
thee.

Q. Where did you meet with the next obstruction?

A. At the second veil, where, on making the regular demand, we heard the
master of that exclaim as before.

Q. Your answer?

A. As before.

Q. What were you then asked?

A. By what further right or benefit we expected to obtain that important
privilege.

Q. Your answer?

A. By the word and sign given us by the master of the first veil.

Q. Did this gain you admission?

A. It did within the second veil.

Q. What was then said to you?

A. Good men and true you must have been, to have come thus far to engage
in so noble and glorious an undertaking, but further you cannot go
without my word and sign, and word of explanation.

Q. What was the word of the master of the second veil?

A. I am that I am, I am hath sent me unto you, Shem, Ham, and Japheth.

Q. What is his sign?

A. It is in imitation of that given by God to Moses, when he commanded
him to put his hand into his bosom, and when he took it out, behold it
was as leprous as snow.

Q. What is his word of explanation?

A. It is explanatory of that sign, is recorded by Moses, and is as
follows: And the Lord said unto Moses, Put now thine hand into thy
bosom, and he put his hand into his bosom, and when he took it out,
behold, his hand was leprous as snow. And He said, Put thine hand into
thy bosom again, and he put his hand into his bosom again, and plucked
it out of his bosom, and behold it was turned again as his other flesh.
And it shall come to pass if they will not believe thee, neither hearken
to the voice of the first sign, that they will believe the voice of the
latter sign.

<span id="page_261">p. 261</span>

Q. Where did you meet with the next obstruction?

A. At the third veil, where, on making the regular demand, we heard the
master of that veil exclaim as before.

Q. Your answer?

A. As before.

Q. What were you then asked?

A. By what further right or benefit we expected to obtain this important
privilege.

Q. Your answer?

A. By the benefit of the word and sign given us by the masters of the
first and second veils.

Q. Did they gain you admission?

A. They did within the third veil.

Q. What was then said to you?

A. Good men and true you must have been, to have come thus far to
promote so noble and good an undertaking, but further you cannot go
without my sign and word of explanation and signet.

Q. What was his sign?

A. It is in imitation of that given by God to Moses, when he commanded
him to take of the water of the river and pour it upon the dry land.

Q. What is his word of explanation?

A. It is explanatory of that sign, is recorded by Moses, and is as
follows: And it shall come to pass if they will not believe also these
two signs, neither hearken unto thy voice, that thou shalt take of the
water of the river and pour it upon the dry land, and the water which
thou takest out of the river shall become blood upon the dry land.

Q. Where did you meet with the next obstruction?

A. At the fourth veil or sanctuary, where on making the regular demand,
we heard the Royal Arch Captain exclaim, "Who dares approach the fourth
veil or sanctuary, where incense burns upon our holy altar both day and
night? Who comes here?"

Q. Your answer?

A. Three worthy sojourners, who have come up to help, aid, and assist in
the rebuilding of the house of the Lord, without the hope of fee or
reward.

Q. What were you then asked?

A. Whence came you?

Q. Your answer?

A. From Babylon.

Q. Of what were you then informed.

A. That by a decree of the *Grand Council*, then in session,

<span id="page_262">p. 262</span>

made in consequence of difficulties having arisen by the introduction of
strangers among the workmen, none are permitted to enter the presence of
the Most Excellent High Priest, Excellent King, and Scribe, while
sitting in council, excepting the true descendants of the twelve tribes
of the children of Israel; it was therefore necessary that we be more
particular in tracing our genealogy, and demanded who we were.

Q. Your answer?

A. We are of your brethren and kin--children of the captivity--we have
been received as Most Excellent Masters, and as such have made ourselves
known to the several guards, and now wait permission to enter the
presence of the Grand Council.

Q. What were you then asked?

A. By what further right or benefit we expected to obtain this important
privilege.

Q. Your answer?

A. By the benefit of the words and signs given us by the masters of the
first, second and third veils, together with the signet.

Q. What was then said to you?

A. We were directed to wait until the Captain of the Host could be
informed of our request and his answer returned.

Q. What answer did he return?

A. Let them be admitted

Q. By whom were you received?

A. By the Captain of the Host, who conducted us into the presence of the
Grand Council, who examined us as to our proficiency in the preceding
degree, and expressed satisfaction at our meeting, after which we were
asked what part of the work we were willing to undertake.

Q. Your answer?

A. Any part, even the most servile, to promote so noble and glorious an
undertaking.

Q. Of what were you then informed?

A. That from the specimens of skill which we had exhibited, the Grand
Council had confidence and belief that we were able to undertake any
part, even the most difficult, but that it was necessary that some more
of the rubbish he removed from the northeast part of the ruins, and they
instructed us to observe and preserve everything that we might discover
of value, for they had no doubt that there were many valuable monuments
of art there which would be essential to the craft.

Q. What followed?

A. The Captain of the Host furnished us with the necessary working
tools, and we repaired to the place as directed, where

<span id="page_263">p. 263</span>

we wrought diligently four days without discovering anything of
interest, excepting passing the ruins of several columns of the order of
architecture; on the fifth, still pursuing our labors, we experienced
that which we at first supposed to be an impenetrable rock, but on my
companion striking it with his crow, it reverberated a hollow sound,
upon which we redoubled our assiduity, and removing some more of the
rubbish, we found it to resemble the top of an arch, in the apex of
which was a stone having on it certain characters which by length of
time were nearly effaced. Night now drawing on, we repaired with it to
the Grand Council.

Q. What was their opinion of the stone?

A. That it was the keystone to the principal arch of King Solomon's
Temple, and from the place in which it was found, they had no doubt it
would lead to important discoveries; upon which we were asked if we were
willing on the morrow to descend the arch in search of them.

Q. Your answer?

A. That the task would be attended with difficulties and dangers, yet we
were willing even at the risk of our lives to promote so noble and
glorious an undertaking.

Q. What followed?

A. We repaired to the place as before, and removed some more of the
rubbish, after which we placed a cable tow seven times around the body
of one of my companions to assist him in descending, and it was agreed,
should the place become offensive, either to health or sight, he should
swing it to the right as a signal to ascend; but should he wish to
descend he should, swing it to the left. In this manner he descended and
found three squares, which they had no doubt had long been concealed; he
gave the signal and ascended, and with them we repaired to the Grand
Council.

Q. What was their opinion of the squares?

A. That they were masters' jewels, most probably worn by our ancient
Grand Masters, Solomon, King of Israel, Hiram, King of Tyre, and Hiram
Abiff, and from the place in which they were found they had no doubt
they would lead to still further and more important discoveries, upon
which we were asked if willing again to descend the arch in search of
the treasures.

Q. Your answer? (As before.)

Q. What followed?

A. We repaired to the place as before, which I descended as before. The
sun shone forth with such redoubled splendor that I was enabled to
descend; in the eastern-most part thereof was

<span id="page_264">p. 264</span>

a trunk of curious form, overlaid with gold, having on its top and sides
certain mysterious characters; availing myself of this I gave the
signal, and ascended; on arriving at the top of the arch I found my
hands involuntarily placed in this position to guard my eyes from the
intense light and heat that arose therefrom above; with the trunk we
repaired to the Grand Council.

Q. What was their opinion of the trunk?

A. That it was the Ark of the Covenant.

Q. What were its contents?

A. A pot, a rod, and a book.

Q. What was their opinion of the pot?

A. That it was the pot of manna, which Moses by divine command, laid up
in the side of the ark as a memorial of the miraculous manner in which
the children of Israel were supplied with that article of food for forty
years in the wilderness.

Q. What was their opinion of the rod?

A. That it was Aaron's rod„ that budded and blossomed, and bore fruit in
a day, which Moses also, by divine command, laid in the side of the ark
as a testimony, to be kept for a token.

Q. What was their opinion of the book?

A. That it was the book of the law in which it is written, I am the
Lord, I appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac and Jacob by the name of God
Almighty, but by my great and sacred name was I not known unto them.

Q. What does it contain?

A. A key to the mysterious characters upon its top and sides, by which
they found those upon its sides to be the initials of our three ancient
Grand Masters, S. K. of I., H. K of T., and H. Abiff. Those upon its
top, the Grand Omnific or Royal Arch word, which we as Royal Arch Masons
should never give except in the presence of three Royal Arch Masons, we
first agreeing by three times three, and under a living arch.

Q. How were your merits rewarded?

A. The Grand Council descended and invested us with the secrets of the
Degree

Q. How were they communicated?

A. The Grand Omnific Royal Arch word in the presence of three regular
Arch Masons, we first agreeing by three times three, and under a living
arch.

Q Have you a sign in this Degree?

A. I have several.

Q. Show me a sign? (Hand to forehead. See sign.)

Q What is that called?

A. The duegard.

<span id="page_265">p. 265</span>

Q. To what does it allude?

A. To the way and manner in which my hands were involuntarily placed on
arriving at the arch, to guard my eyes from the intense light and heat
that arose therefrom above.

Q. Show me another sign? (Give sign.)

Q. What is that called?

A. The sign

Q. To what does it allude?

A. To the penalty of my obligation, that I would sooner have my skull
struck off than divulge any of the secrets of this Degree unlawfully,

Q. Give me another sign? (Give sign.)

Q. What is that called?

A. The grand hailing sign, or sign of distress of a Royal Arch Mason.

Q. To what does it allude?

A. To the additional portion of the penalty of my obligation, that I
would sooner have my skull clove off, and have my brain exposed to the
scorchings rays of a noonday sun, than divulge any of the secrets of
this Degree unlawfully.

Q. What are the working tools of a Royal Arch Mason?

A. The pick, spade, and crow.

Q. What does the spade teach us as Royal Arch Masons? (Monitorial. )

Q. What is the use of the crow?

A. It is used by operative masons to describe circles--every part of the
circumference of which is equally near and equally distant from its
centre; so is every creature whom God hath made equally near and equally
dear.

Q. What is the equilateral or perfect triangle upon which the word is
formed emblematical of?

A. The three certain attributes of Deity--namely, Omniscience,
Omnipotence, and Omnipresence, for as the three equal legs or angles
form but one triangle, so the three attributes constitute but one God.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_74"></span>[218:1](dun08.htm#fr_74.md) In America, we find an
essential variation from any other system of the Royal Arch. The names
of the officers vary materially, as also do the ceremonies. As in
Ireland, it constitutes the Seventh Degree, although the intermediate
steps are different. In Ireland they are: 1. E. A. P.; 2. F. C.; 3. M.
M.; 4. P. M.; 5. Excellent; 6. Super-Excellent: 7. Royal Arch: while in
America the Fourth is Mark Master; 5. P. M.; 6. Most Excellent Master;
7. Royal Arch.--Origin of the [English](errata.htm#7.md) Royal Arch, p. 58.

<span id="fn_75"></span>[219:1](dun08.htm#fr_75.md) The members of this
Degree are denominated *companions*, and are "entitled to a full
explanation of the *mysteries* of the Order"; whereas in the former
Degrees they are recognized by the common, familiar appellation of
brothers, and kept in a state of profound ignorance of the *sublime
secret* which is disclosed in this Chapter. This accords with the custom
of Pythagoras, who thus distinguished his pupils. After a probation of
five years, as before stated, they were admitted into the presence of
the preceptor, called his *companions*, and permitted freely to converse
with him. Previously to the expiration of that term he delivered his
instructions to them from behind a screen.--*Fellows's Inquiry into the
Origin, History, and Purport of Freemasonry*, p. 321.

<span id="fn_76"></span>[224:1](dun08.htm#fr_76.md) Cole adopts the
following sentiment of a brother Mason: "In the R. A. (Royal Arch)
Mason's Degree I beheld myself exalted to the top of *Pisgah*, an
extensive scene opened to my view of the glory and goodness of the M. E.
H. P. (Most Excellent High Priest) of our salvation. I dug deep for
hidden treasures, found them, and *regained* the *omnific* word."

"If we pass on to the Royal Arch," says the Rev. G. Oliver, in his <span
id="page_225">p. 225</span> Lectures on Freemasonry, "we receive a
wonderful accession of knowledge, and find every thing *made perfect*;
for this is the *ne plus ultra* of Masonry, and can never be exceeded by
any human institution."--*Fellows's Inquiry into the Origin, History,
and Purport of Freemasonry*, p. 322.

A Degree indescribably more august, sublime, and important than any
which precede it, and is, in fact, the summit and perfection of ancient
Masonry. It impresses on our minds a belief in the being of a God,
without beginning of days or end of years, the great and
incomprehensible Alpha and Omega, and reminds us of the reverence which
is due to His Holy NAME.--*Historical Landmarks*, vol. i. p. 86.

<span id="fn_77"></span>[226:1](dun08.htm#fr_77.md) This ineffable name (in
INDIA) was *Aum*, which, in its triliteral form, was significant of the
creative, preservative, and destroying power, that is, of Brahma,
Vishnu, and Siva.--*Lexicon*, p. 146.

JEHOVAH. Of the varieties of this sacred name in use among the different
nations of the earth, three particularly merit the attention of Royal
Arch Masons:

1\. JAH. This name of God is found in the 68th Psalm, v. 4.

2\. BAAL OR BEL. This word signifies a *lord*, *master*, or *possessor*,
and hence it was applied by many of the nations of the East to denote
the Lord of all things, and the Master of the world.

3\. ON. This was the name by which JEHOVAH was worshipped among the
Egyptians.

I have made these remarks on the three names of *God* in Chaldaic,
Syriac and Egyptian, *Baal*, *Jah*, and *On*, in the expectation that my
Royal Arch Companions will readily recognize them in a corrupted
form.--*Lexicon*.

<span id="fn_78"></span>[242:1](dun08.htm#fr_78.md) Candidates at the
present day usually descend the vault by means of a ladder.

<span id="fn_79"></span>[243:1](dun08.htm#fr_79.md) A candidate is said to
be EXALTED when he receives the Degree of Holy Royal Arch, the Seventh
in York Masonry. Exalted means *elevated* or *lifted up*, and is
applicable both to a peculiar ceremony of the Degree, and to the fact
that this Degree, in the rite in which it is practised, constitutes the
summit of ancient Masonry.--*Lexicon*.

<span id="fn_80"></span>[246:1](dun08.htm#fr_80.md) The foundations of the
Temple were opened and cleared from the accumulation of rubbish, that a
level site might be procured for the commencement of the building. While
engaged in excavations for this purpose, *three fortunate sojourners*
are said to have discovered our ancient stone of foundation, which had
been deposited in the secret crypt by Wisdom, Strength, and Beauty, to
prevent the communication of ineffable secrets to profane or unworthy
persons. The discovery having been communicated to the prince, priest,
and prophet of the Jews, the stone was adopted as the chief corner-stone
of the re-edified building; and thus became, in a new and expressive
sense, the type of a more excellent dispensation. An avenue was also
accidentally discovered, supported by seven pairs of pillars, perfect
and entire, which, from their situation, had escaped the fury of the
flames that had consumed the Temple, and the desolation of war which had
destroyed the city. This secret vault, which had been built by Solomon
as a secure depository for certain valuable secrets, that would
inevitably have been lost without some such expedient for their
preservation, communicated by a subterranean avenue with the King's
palace; but at the destruction of Jerusalem, the entrance having been
closed by the rubbish of falling buildings, it had been now discovered
by the appearance of *a keystone among the foundations* of the Sanctum
Sanctorum. A careful inspection was then made, and the invaluable
secrets were placed in safe custody.--*Historical Landmarks*, vol. ii.
p. 434.

In preparing the foundations, as we are told by the Jewish Rabbins, the
workmen discovered a subterranean vault or cavity, supported by seven
pairs of pillars supporting so many arches. This vault, at the
destruction of Jerusalem, having been filled with the rubbish of the
building, escaped observation, and was indicated at the present period
by the discovery of *a keystone among the foundations*. The Rabbins add,
that Josiah, foreseeing the destruction of the Temple, commanded the
Levites to deposit the Ark of the Covenant in this vault, where it was
found by some of Zerubbabel's workmen. But there is no ground for this
belief; for if the secret of the vault had been known to Josiah, it must
have been known also to his idolatrous predecessors. who would doubtless
have plundered it of its valuable contents, and exposed them to the
world, in contempt of the true God to whom they referred, and whom these
degenerate monarchs had wholly renounced. It is much more probable, that
in the latter years of Solomon, when he had almost forgotten God, his
visits to this vault were discontinued, and the entrance being curiously
concealed among the caverns underneath his palace. the secret died with
him, and the communication was forever closed. It is certain, however,
if the tradition of this vault be correct, that *the Ark of the Covenant
was not found in it*; <span id="page_247">p. 247</span> for it was one
of the invaluable gifts of God which the second Temple did not contain,
and consequently it could not have been preserved by
Josiah.--*Historical Landmarks*, vol. ii. p. 436.

<span id="fn_81"></span>[249:1](dun08.htm#fr_81.md) The author of *Ahiman
Rezon* has stated that he could convey his mind to an ancient Mason in
the presence of a modern Mason, without the latter knowing whether
either of them were Masons. He further asserted that he was able, with a
few Masonic implements, *i.e.*, two squares and a common gavel or
hammer, to convey any word or sentence of his own, or the immediate
dictations of a stranger, to a skilful and intelligent Free-mason of the
ancient [order](errata.htm#8.md), without speaking, writing, or noise; and
that to any distance, when the parties can see each other, and at the
same time be able to distinguish squares from circles. This Masonic
system of cipher-writing is now well understood.--*Origin of the English
Royal Arch*, p. 42.

<span id="fn_82"></span>[250:1](dun08.htm#fr_82.md) The WORD of the Royal
Arch Degree, as worked in England, is Jao-Bul-On.

Macrobius, in his Saturnalia (lib. i. 18), says that it was an admitted
axiom among the heathen, that the triliteral JAH, or rather ΙΑΩ, was the
sacred name of the Supreme God. And the Clarian oracle, which was of
unknown antiquity, being asked which of the deities was named ΙΑΩ,
answered in these memorable words:

"'The initiated are bound to conceal the mysterious secrets. Learn thou,
that ΙΑΩ, is the Great God Supreme, who ruleth over all.'

"Now it so happens, that in the gems of the early Christians we find
these very letters, ΙΑΩ, which are an abbreviation of the name of
JEHOVAH, used as a monogram to express the name of the Saviour of
mankind, who was thus represented as existing before time was, and shall
exist when time shall he no more. It was first adopted by the Eastern
Church, and signified Ιησους, Αλφα Ομεγα, Jesus, Alpha Omega, or in
other words: Jesus, the First and the Last."--*The Insignia of the Royal
Arch*, p. 32.

The Royal Arch Word to have been perfectly in keeping with the Degree,
and with the general construction of Masonry, should have been a triad,
not only of syllables, but also of letters. Our transatlantic brethren
have seen it in its true light; but they have corrected the error
unlearnedly. It ought to have been, if the principle of its construction
be allowed, to be orthodox:

<div align="center">

|                                  |                                  |                                  |
|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| *Syriac*.                        | *Chaldee*.                       | *Hindoo*.                        |
| \_\_\_\_\_ \_\_\_\_\_ \_\_\_\_\_ | \_\_\_\_\_ \_\_\_\_\_ \_\_\_\_\_ | \_\_\_\_\_ \_\_\_\_\_ \_\_\_\_\_ |

</div>

*The Insignia of the Royal Arch*, p. 34. That is to say, instead of
JAO-BUL-ON, or JAH-BUH-LUN, Dr. Oliver suggests:

<div align="center">

|           |            |           |
|-----------|------------|-----------|
| *Syriac*. | *Chaldee*. | *Hindoo*. |
| JAO,      | BEL,       | AUN,      |
| or        | or         | or        |
| JAH.      | BUL.       | AUM.      |

</div>

For at page 15 of *The Insignia*, he writes thus:

"But the Royal Arch Degree is founded on the number three, and therefore
each member of the word ought to have been triliteral. Among the
Syrians, the Chaldeans, the Phœnicians and others, the ineffable name of
the Deity was Bel, Bal, Bul, Baal, or Belin. . . . Again, the Egyptians
and Hindoos reverenced On or Om, *i.e.*, Aun, or Aum, as the name of
their chief Deity."

And vide *Historical Landmarks*, vol. ii. p. 549:

"One says it was Jau, another thinks it was Jaoth, a third, Java;
others, Juba, Jao, Jah, Jehovah, and Jove. In a word, the letters of the
name are perishable, and the pronunciation of little moment: but the
Being himself is ineffable, incomprehensible, and worthy of our utmost
veneration. He was called by the Romans Jove, or Jah; by the Chaldeans,
the Phœnicians, and the Celtæ, Bel or Bul; and by the Indians,
Egyptians, and Greeks, Om or On."

<span id="fn_83"></span>[251:1](dun08.htm#fr_83.md) The grand hailing sign
is made by locking the fingers of both hands together, and carrying them
to the top of the head, the palms upward. Then let them drop to the
sides.

<span id="fn_84"></span>[253:1](dun08.htm#fr_84.md) At my first exaltation,
I was taught to believe it an ancient degree; but I confess, that even
at that period I entertained considerable doubts on the point. The
Degree is too incongruous to be of any great antiquity. It exhibits too
many evidences of modern construction to be received with implicit
credence as a ceremony practised by the ancient Dionysiacs, or even the
more modern colleges of Freemasons, or confraternities of the Middle
Ages. The earliest mention of it in England which I can find, is in the
year 1740, just one year after the trifling alteration, sanctioned by
the modern Grand Lodge, already mentioned.--*Origin of the English Royal
Arch*, pp. 19, 20.

<span id="fn_85"></span>[253:2](dun08.htm#fr_85.md) The fact is, the grand
omnific (*all-creating*) *lost word*, it will be seen in the sequel, was
eventually found in a vault under the ruins of Solomon's Temple; and the
difficulty was, *rationally* to account for the manner in which it got
there. This, therefore, is the grand object of the *Select Master's
Degree*; and, at the same time, so to locate the word as symbolically to
represent its archetype, the sun *lost* in the inferior hemisphere. For
this purpose a history of the order was manufactured by its founders, of
which the following is a sketch:

"The three Grand Masters, at the building of the Temple, entered into a
solemn agreement not to confer the Master's Degree until the Temple
should be completed; that all three must be present when it should be
conferred, and if either should be taken away by death prior to the
finishing of the Temple, the Master's Degree should be lost.

"After this *wise* arrangement, lest the knowledge of the arts and
sciences, together with the patterns and valuable models which were
contained in the Temple, should be lost, they agreed to build a *secret
vault* under ground, leading from Solomon's most retired apartment, *a
due west course*, and ending under the *sanctum sanctorum* of the
Temple, to be divided into *nine separate arches*. The ninth arch was to
be the place for holding the grand council, and also for a deposit of a
true copy of all those things which were *contained in the sanctum
sanctorum above*.

"After the ninth arch was completed, the three Grand Masters deposited
therein those things which were important to the craft, such as the Ark
of the Covenant, a pot of manna, the rod of Aaron, the book of the law,
etc.<span id="page_254">p. 254</span>

"Prior to the completion of the Temple, Grand Master Hiram Abiff was
assassinated, and by his death the Master's Word was lost. The two kings
were willing to do all in their power to preserve the *Sacred Word*, and
as they could not communicate it to any, by reason of the death of
Hiram, they agreed to place it in the *secret vault*, that if the other
treasures were ever brought to light, the Word might be found
also."--*Fellows's Inquiry into the Origin, History, and Purport of
Freemasonry*, pp. 308, 309.
