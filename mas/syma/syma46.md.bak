### CHAPTER XLII

### AN INTRODUCTION TO THE THIRD STEP

#### I

The moment one steps into the Third Degree he finds himself in an
atmosphere very different from that of the First and the Second: the
opening and closing ceremonies are similar to theirs, but the
architectural symbolism which was in them the predominant feature is
here crowded into the background by a symbolism of a very different
order; for whereas the first two degrees deliver their message in the
terms of building, the Third speaks of a living and a dying and a rising
again. And so compact is it of profound meanings that it furnishes many
of the suggestions, as many scholars have noted, from which the higher
grades have developed their magnificent teachings.

By what men the Degree was made, or when, are questions on which our
authorities differ so widely that one student—Brother Robert I.
Clegg—has collected no fewer than twenty different theories, while
another—Brother Hextall—has found fourteen different interpretations.
Where so many scholars have failed to discover a satisfactory hypothesis
it would require some temerity to offer a theory of one's own, and I
must content myself to state, as nearly as I can, such positions as the
majority have agreed on.

It is believed that in the beginning of the Grand Lodge period there
were at most but two degrees, these being known, as I have already
described, as the Apprentice

<span id="page_250">p. 250</span>

and Fellow Craft or Master Mason parts, the latter being convertible
terms. But during this same period so much new material—new, at least,
to the ritual of initiation—was introduced that it became necessary to
break up the old Apprentice Degree into two parts, leaving the old
Second to become the new Third. This was done for the sake of
convenience, as the ceremonies had grown too long for only two evenings.
This division was made some time between 1723 and 1738.

The new arrangement was a long time in gaining a foothold among the
brethren. At first only a few were made Masters and then only in Grand
Lodge; in fact, so few knew how to "put on" the degree that for some
time special "Masters’ Lodges" were organised for the purpose. The
progress of the tri-gradal system was even slower in countries other
than England; Gould notes that the Third did not become common in Scotch
Lodges until after 1770.

Why was the Third so slow in "taking on" if it was the old Second
Degree? The explanation of the problem seems to be that so much new
material had been added to it that it had become practically a new
ceremony. There is even some reason to believe that it was this new
material which among many other things gave offence to many old Masons
living at a distance from London, who were thereby led to form the rival
Grand Lodge of "the Ancients."

By whom was this new material introduced? Some attribute the innovations
to Anderson, others to Dr. Desaguliers; others, of whom Pike was one,
have held to the theory that at the time of the Revival certain groups
of Speculatives seized the opportunity to graft some of their own ideas
upon the Ritual. Another theory, more reasonable than these, it seems to
me, will be brought out when we seek to answer the next question.

<span id="page_251">p. 251</span>

#### II

What was the new material introduced between 1723–1738? Many of our
scholars, perhaps a majority, would answer, "The Hiram Abiff legend." As
we are to devote a section to this I cannot go into that matter here
except to say that it seems unreasonable, on the face of it, that so
elaborate a drama, occupying the greater part of one whole degree, could
have been bodily imported into the Ritual as a wholly new thing; the
conservative "old Mason," of whom many were remaining in the Revival
period, would not have tolerated so huge an innovation. The more
reasonable theory is that the substance of the legend, and materials
appertaining thereto, had long been a part of the floating tradition of
the Craft if indeed, as there is some evidence to show that it was, it
was not a part of the old Operative Ritual. This would answer the
question, Who imported the new materials? No one man or group of men
imported it; "The Third Degree was not made, it grew—like the great
cathedrals, no one of which can be ascribed to a single artist, but to
an order of men working in unity of enterprise and aspiration." To this
it nay be added that the degree has not ceased to grow, in America at
least, for it is more elaborate here than in England, even as it is more
elaborate there than in other countries—more elaborate, and different.

By whom the degree was made, and when, will furnish material for many
debates in years to come, and in the lap of that future must the problem
be left; but of one thing we can be very sure—the idea enshrined in the
ceremony is so old that we find it serving as the motif of initiatory
dramas long before the dawn of history. In a majority of the Ancient
Mysteries, to judge by such memorials as we have of them, the action
centred in the violent death of some person and his being raised again.
In various

<span id="page_252">p. 252</span>

guises was this idea presented but always did it convey the same
truth—that in men there is something that cannot die, that this
"something" is akin to the divine, that it can be given the rule of a
man during his earth pilgrimage, and that it is the purpose of
initiation to discover and to develop this divine element in human life.
This is nothing other than Regeneration; it is nothing other than
Eternal Life, the life of God in the soul of man lived in the bounds of
time and space and under human conditions. Such, I take it, is the
secret of our Third Degree.
