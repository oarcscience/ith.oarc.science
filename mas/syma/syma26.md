### CHAPTER XXII

### THE NORTHEAST CORNER

#### I

When the candidate, reinvested with that of which he had been divested,
is made to stand in the Northeast Corner of the lodge as the youngest
Entered Apprentice, both the position in which he stands and the posture
of his body have reference to such laws of the "new life" in Masonry as
are deserving of careful consideration. It has long been observed, and
that for the most obvious reasons, that Northeast is neither North nor
East, but a midway situation partaking of both. If we recall that the
North is the place of darkness, the symbol of the profane and
unregenerated world, and that the East is the place of light, the symbol
of all perfection in the Masonic life, you will see that it is fitting
that an Apprentice be made to find his station there; for by virtue of
being an Apprentice he is as yet neither wholly profane nor wholly
initiate, having yet much light to receive in Masonry. It is unfortunate
that some Masons, in all the deep senses of the words, never move beyond
this position but remain, through indifference to the influences of the
Order or sluggishness of spirit, in that halfway place.

His standing in an *upright posture* is at once a hint and a prophecy;
it is a hint because it is indicative of the plumb which will be offered
him as one of the working tools of a Fellow-Craft; it is a prophecy
because it is an anticipation of that raising up which will be made in
the Sublime Degree. Inasmuch as these completer unfoldings

<span id="page_153">p. 153</span>

of this symbolism will come in due time, and under their appropriate
circumstances, I have elected to defer a study of moral perpendicularity
to subsequent pages.

Meanwhile we may be reminded that the Northeast Corner is also the
place, at least ideally, of the laying of the Cornerstone, a ceremony as
ancient as it is significant. From of old the builders have ever
attended the placing of the Cornerstone with elaborate ceremonies, often
lasting many days, and the custom is still in use. If we stop to inquire
the reason for this celebration of a constructing process we shall find
that the Cornerstone is the most important stone in the building, and
that it represents the sacrifices that have gone to the making of the
structure.

"That is called the Cornerstone, or chief Cornerstone, which is placed
in the extreme angle of a foundation," writes a seventeenth century
commentator, "conjoining and holding together two walls of the pile,
meeting from different quarters." Performing a function of such cardinal
importance, the Cornerstone has always appealed to men with a meaning
beyond its practical use, serving as the symbol of that which is the
foundation and principle of consistency in a structure. The Apprentice,
standing upright and ready for his working tools, a tried and trusty
brother, is, accordingly, the Cornerstone of the Fraternity, even as
youth is the Cornerstone of society.

But there is a meaning in it even beyond this. Before the influence of
civilisation banished many barbarous usages from the rites of men it was
no uncommon custom to bury a living human being under the cornerstone.
This was at first, probably, intended to mollify the gods of the ground
on which the building stood, and later a recognition of those sacrifices
always required of mere when they would build. (See Speth's "Builders'
Rites.") As

<span id="page_154">p. 154</span>

time went on effigies or statues were used in lieu of human beings, and
this was in time refined away into the custom of placing metals, jewels,
and other valuables in the cornerstone, even as we Masons now use Corn,
Wine, and Oil.

#### II

In keeping with all this we may see in the Apprentice standing in the
Northeast a dedicated and consecrated man who offers *himself* as a
building stone in the spiritual Temple which the lodge is making of
itself and striving to make of all human society. This symbolism, wholly
divested of every vestige of the inhuman practices of which it is a
far-off reminder, is beautiful and wise every way, for until men, the
individual as well as the mass, do offer their own lives to the service
of the Brotherhood and the State both Brotherhood and State will ever
remain as imperfect as they are now.

Moreover, it seems to me that when the Craft says to the Candidate,
"*You* are the material of which I am builded, and of which the kingdom
of Heaven is being builded" it pays a tribute to the essential dignity,
and even divinity, of human nature itself. We humans may be crude and
barbarous, we may be of the earth, earthy, but it is out of us, out of
that very nature we often affect to despise that all the noble stately
things of the future must be made. There is no need that we call angels
to our assistance, or any celestial beings whatever; in us, as we now
are, are those qualities which, would we let them rule in us, would
bring the will of God to pass in the earth. It is not beyond reason that
the reigning religion of this western world dares to link God to Man in
the Person of its Founder, for in a man there is that which is at once
Human and Divine. This is the ancient

<span id="page_155">p. 155</span>

faith of the Builders, and it is above all things fitting that it should
have been set to music by Edwin Markham, who is both poet and Mason, as
gifted in the one as he is enthusiastic in the other:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

"We men of earth have here the stuff  
 Of Paradise—we have enough!  
 We need no other thing to build  
 The stairs into the Unfulfilled—  
 No other ivory for the doors—  
 No other marble for the floors—  
 No other cedar for the beam  
 And dome of man's immortal dream.  
 Here on the paths of every day—  
 Here on the common human way—  
 Is all the busy gods would take  
 To build a heaven, to mould and make  
 New Edens. Ours the stuff sublime  
 To build Eternity in time."
