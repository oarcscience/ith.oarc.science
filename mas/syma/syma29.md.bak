### CHAPTER XXV

### PASSING

#### I

In Operative days the Apprentice was compelled to spend a series of
years, sometimes five, usually seven, in mastering his trade. During
this period he remained indentured, or bound, to some Master Mason; at
its termination he was examined in an assembly of the lodge, usually on
St. John's Day, and if found proficient was *passed* to the grade of
Fellow Craft. In our Speculative system there is no necessity that so
much time be spent between the two degrees, but many of our best
experienced men believe we have gone to the opposite extreme. In at
least three jurisdictions in the United States the candidate may be
passed from the First to the Second in *two weeks;* in nine
jurisdictions he may pass as soon as proficient; in a majority one month
must intervene. Of course, the candidate may take longer than necessary
in every case, but the point is that he is almost never *required* to
spend more than one month in preparation for passing! Surely, no man can
become fully prepared for advancement, which means that he has
*mastered* the teachings of the preceding degree and is made ready for
the next, in so brief an interval, especially if he be engaged in daily
work! Surely one thing to explain the indifference of many members to
the order is just this habit of hurrying through the degrees!

When the Apprentice passed to the Fellow Craft grade in Operative
Masonry he was given a distinguishing

<span id="page_172">p. 172</span>

mark, which was usually a crude figure having something of the
appearance of a letter of the alphabet, though some of these marks were
pictures, and others were symbols or emblems. "It is very remarkable,"
writes Gould, in his "Concise History," (p. 239) "that these marks are
to be found in all countries—in the chambers of the Great Pyramid at
Gizeh, on the underground walls of Jerusalem, in Herculaneum and
Pompeii, on Roman walls and Grecian temples, in Hindustan, Mexico, Peru,
Asia Minor—as well as on the great ruins of England, France, Germany,
Scotland, Italy, Portugal and Spain. Some of the foundation stones of
the Haram Wall of Jerusalem are cut in the surface to a depth of
three-quarters of an inch, but most of the characters are painted with a
red colour like vermillion. . . . To use the words of the late Professor
Hayter Lewis, they seem to give at least strong presumptive ground for
the belief that in these splendid foundation stones *we may see the
actual work of the Phœnician Hiram for his great Master, Solomon*."
(Italics mine.) Similar marks were used by Mediæval guilds, among them
the Masons. By the latter they were employed to identify each man with
his own work in order that responsibility for ill-done tasks might be
easily traced. In early days these marks were chiselled or painted in
plain view and often, evidently, carried a symbolic significance; in
later days they were placed on a side of the stone that was hidden from
sight. Each mark was a worker's own private possession which another
could copy only at his peril; consequently the receiving of an
authorised mark by an Apprentice when passing to be a Fellow Craft was a
token of his assumption of full responsibility for his work and must
have been to him an occasion of pride and rejoicing. It would be easy to
comment on this from our Speculative point of view, did space permit,
for every Mason, even

<span id="page_173">p. 173</span>

to-day, is leaving his own mark on his work, whether it be a visible
mark or not, and the All-Seeing Eye beholds it when men cannot.

In order to be passed the Operative Apprentice had also to produce an
*essay*, or masterpiece, the latter word literally meaning, *Master's
piece*. It was a proof of his ability to handle his tools and to
understand his materials, and it was a token to the Craft of his mastery
of its trade secrets. We have a parallel to this in the present custom
of colleges in demanding of a student some treatise or book to prove his
worthiness for a degree. A lodge of Masons might also take up a similar
rule again; if a candidate were compelled to study the Craft and its
history enough to enable him to write a paper about it, or if he were
required to give some signal of genuine service in its behalf, his
earnestness therein would enable him to get more out of Masonry, and
Masonry to get more out of him.

One test we still employ in advancement that was used by Operatives of
old—the memory test, a thing I am very sure you will remember as vividly
as I do myself! Some radical critics are advocating that the
letter-perfect learning of the lecture be abandoned, but this, I
believe, would be a catastrophe, for this work is the only form of
Masonic study *demanded* by the lodge, and that, surely, when we
remember all that Masonry has to offer its votaries, is little enough.

#### II

It may be noted, in conclusion, that it was often the custom in old
lodges to appoint an *Intender*, or instructor to have responsibility
for teaching the candidate. Our present system of Custodians of the
Work, or other similar standing committees, to instruct District
Lecturers

<span id="page_174">p. 174</span>

and Masters in the proper methods of ritualism, is roughly analogous to
the ancient custom, but it has only a remote influence on the candidate.
It would be a wise thing as I have already more than once suggested, if
every lodge maintained a permanent school in which to expound to the
initiates the Mysteries of our Craft. The Masonic Study Club is a step
in the right direction; may they multiply in number, and increase in
power!

Up to this point I have been interpreting the *passing* in the light of
Operative customs and you may be wishing to remind me that in our
present Speculative system we have added a Third Degree, and that to-day
the Fellow Craft is no longer a master of the trade. All this I admit,
but is not this true, that if so much preparation was once required for
passing to one higher degree, that we should require all the more
preparation for advancing to two higher degrees? If our candidates are
caused more thoroughly to master the Fellow Craft teaching all the more
will they be ready for the *sublime* degree; besides, the Second Degree
is so rich in material that it is many times worth a candidate's labour
to make it his own; and furthermore, the better a man has prepared for
the Fellow Craft work, the more completely will he have digested the
teachings of the Apprentice Degree, and that is always a consummation
devoutly to be wished!
