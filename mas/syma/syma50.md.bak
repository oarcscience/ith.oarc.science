### CHAPTER XLVI

### THE TROWEL

#### I

This emblem is like a key; insignificant in itself it opens up matters
of such vast import that to pursue its teachings through all their
ramifications would itself require a book; consequently I can only hope
to set down a few hints of the rich and various applications of it.

There is no need to say that of all working tools it is the most
appropriate to the Master Mason Degree; it carries that significance
upon its surface. The Entered Apprentice, who can make only a beginning
at the task of shaping the ashlar, needs only the gavel and the guage;
the Fellow Craft, to bring the stone into completeness of size and form,
requires the plumb, square, and level; the Master Mason's task is to set
the finished stone in its place, and bind it there, for which purpose
the trowel is his most necessary tool. Therefore the Master Mason has
been given the Trowel as his working tool because it is most symbolic of
his function in the great work of Temple Building; when that tool has
done its work there is nothing more to do, because the structure stands
complete, a united mass, incapable of falling apart; the stones which
were many have now, because of the binding power of the cement, become
as one.

#### II

If the stone represents an individual man, and if the Temple represents
the Fraternity as a whole, it is evident

<span id="page_265">p. 265</span>

that the Trowel is the symbol of that which has power to bind men
together. Therefrom arises the question, what is this unifying power?
Let us undertake to answer this question from the several points of view
of the individual, the Fraternity, and the world at large.

We very frequently meet with men who seem to lack unity in their makeup;
a spirit of disorganisation or anarchy is at work in them so that they
seem to live at cross-purposes with themselves. What they know they
should do they do not, and many things which they do they do against
their own will. They may have personal force, but it is scattered and
their lives never come to a focus. Of these men we say that they lack
character and we say right. Character comes from a word that meant
originally a graving tool; after long use the name of the tool came to
be applied to the engraving itself, and thus the term has come to stand
for a man whose actions give one an impression of definiteness and
clear-cuttedness, like an engraving. A man who lacks character is a
blur, a confused and self-contradictory mass of impulses and forces. The
one salvation for such a man is to find some means of unifying himself,
of using himself to some purpose so as to arrive at some goal.

What can he use? We may answer, perhaps, that he can best use an ideal,
for an ideal is nothing other than a picture of what one wills to be
which he ever keeps before him, as an architect refers to his blue
prints. In short, the man needs a plan to live by, a thing we have
symbolised in our Ritual by means of the tracing board.

Before the time of the Reformation, builders did not use plans drawn to
scale as architects now do, but laid out their building design on the
ground, or even on the floor of the workshop or the lodge. In early
English lodges this design was often drawn on the floor in chalk by the
Master, and the youngest Entered Apprentice

<span id="page_266">p. 266</span>

would erase it with a mop and water at the end of the ceremony; after a
while, to make this labour unnecessary, "the plan of work" was drawn on
a permanent board which was set on an easel and exhibited during the
degree, as is still done in England. The tracing board of a degree,
therefore, is the plan of work for that degree, drawn in symbols and
hieroglyphics, and the tracing board itself, as it stands in the lodge,
is a constant reminder to the Mason that, as a spiritual builder, he
must have a plan or an ideal for his life; and when the Mason does live
in loyalty to an ideal he is a man of character; his faculties work in
unison, there is no war between his purposes and his behaviour, and he
is able to stand among his brethern as a completed temple. Such a man
has used a trowel in his own life.

#### III

It is more difficult to answer the question, What is the force that can
unite individual Masons into a unified and harmonious Order, but a
practicable answer may be found by asking a further question, What is it
that now unites us, even if imperfectly? What is the cement? Perhaps we
cannot point to any one thing. When I inquire of my own heart what it is
that ties me to my fellow Masons I find myself thinking of many things.
There is the sense of a wonderful history which links up to unknown
brethren who lived generations ago; there is the symbolism of the
Society, in which precious truths and living philosophies have been
poured as into golden vases; there is the spirit which pervades the
Order, a sense of oneness in purpose and aims, of tolerance, of charity,
of patience and forbearing; there is also the remembrance of the
obligation which I voluntarily assumed, and which wove into my heart a
silken thread,

<span id="page_267">p. 267</span>

the other end of which is woven into the hearts of my brethren; these
and similar influences hold me to the Craft now and ever shall, but how
to sum them up in one word I know not, except that word be Brotherhood.
Brotherhood has suffered much from over-use, from sentimentalism, and
from oratory, but no other word can be found to take its place.
Therefore we may say that, so far as the Fraternity itself is concerned,
the trowel and the cement spread on by the •trowel, is the kindly,
pervasive, irresistible spirit and power of Brotherhood. True it is that

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

"Fellowship is heaven;  
 The lack of fellowship is hell."

</div>

If this be so we have already to hand an answer to our last question,
What power can unite the scattered peoples and nations of the earth,
especially in a time like this when they are more than ever sundered by
passion and hatred? Surely, if the spirit and influence of Brotherhood
can call together two million men out of all classes and localities of
America and can bind them into the solidarity of a great united Order,
that same power can accomplish similar results if applied to the world
at large. Diplomats and politicians do not seem to believe it, but it is
true nevertheless, trite as it may sound, and Freemasonry's benign
genius of fraternity was never more badly needed in the earth than just
now. Every device has been used to bind the peoples together; force,
money, fear, superstition, and what not; let us hope that sooner or
later the race will try the means proved so effective by more than two
hundred years of Freemasonry.
