### CHAPTER XLIII

### THE VITAL PARTS OF THE BREAST

#### I

On his entrance to the Third Degree the candidate is received in a
manner peculiarly impressive; he is told that as the vital parts of the
body are in the breasts so are the vital things of the human world to be
found in Friendship, Morality, and Brotherly Love. How vague are these
words! We have rolled them around in our mouths so much that they have
become smooth as billiard balls; they have been used so often for merely
oratorical purposes that they have grown nebulous and abstract; and
because they have become smooth and vague we are prone to let them slip
through our minds without their depositing their meaning behind them, a
thing fatal to an understanding of Masonry, the essence of much of which
lies in these three wonderful words.

Man is by nature a social being. It has been proved that he cannot exist
as a sane creature except he live among his fellows, for his very
personality itself is a social product; the language on his lips implies
another to hear and to understand; his emotions and affections seek
another in whom to find satisfaction. Not until the individual has found
other human individuals who can feel with him, think with him, and act
with him can he know the meaning of happiness. But it is a part of the
tragedy of our lives that we are so clumsy in uncovering our own souls,
and others are so inexpert in understanding our secret feelings, that
our fellowship is never complete,

<span id="page_254">p. 254</span>

so that the music of companionship is continually being disturbed by
jangling dissonances of misunderstanding. With a friend, however, it is
different; he is one with whom we can live in harmony, as if the two
lives could mingle like two streams, his thoughts and our thoughts
merging together and the two spirits living as one. Such a union is one
of the sweetest experiences in all the world and he who has found his
friend may well congratulate himself as being one who has discovered the
pearl of great price. Little wonder that our prophets and seers have so
often broken into rhapsody on this subject! that our literature may
count as its richest treasures such utterances as those of Emerson,
Black, Trumbull, Montaigne, Bacon, and Cicero concerning friendship.

#### II

Morality has been stretched to cover so many meanings, it has been
forced into the support of so many conflicting theories, and been made
fellow to so many crimes against reason, that we can hardly blame many
for not being interested in it. But the word is necessary because the
idea of which it is the sign is a real and a necessary idea. If men
misuse it there is all the more reason for our learning how to rightly
use it.

What is morality? It is derived from a Latin word meaning "custom," and
it is probable that the Romans first used it in the sense of living
according to the custom. In Christian times a richer meaning was poured
into it so that it has come to mean "the life of righteousness." But
what is righteousness? It is living the right way, doing the right
things, thinking the right thoughts,—a very Masonic behaviour. But what
is right? We might answer that question in two ways; we might say that
the right is that which gives us the fullest, completest

<span id="page_255">p. 255</span>

life, for it is the purpose of morality to give us life and give it more
abundantly; or, we might say that right is conformity to the law of our
being. As the scientist seeks to learn the laws of nature and to conform
to them, so does a righteous man seek to discover the laws of his own
nature in order to conform to them; he obeys the laws of the body by
living healthfully, he obeys the laws of the intellect by thinking facts
without prejudice or haste, and he obeys the laws of the heart by loving
only that which he finds to be good and true.

Of Brotherly Love much more might be said, though space may not permit,
especially the Brotherly Love which Masonry inculcates. How can
brotherhood be possible among us men? We are all so unbrotherly, we are
so selfish, we are so quick to take or give offence! The solution of
this troublesome problem lies in the fact that the one cure for
unbrotherliness is brotherliness. We love our enemies that they may
cease being enemies. We make friends in order to have friends.
Brotherliness is a creative force. Brotherhood is not a thing already
made, it is a condition we must create, so that the very presence of
unbrotherliness is a challenge to brotherhood to do its best. When our
fellows in lodge act thoughtlessly toward us, and bruise and hurt us, it
is not for us to retaliate; insofar as we are true Masons we shall love
them even though they are not lovable, simply because the only way in
which we can make men lovable is by loving them. Brotherly Love,
therefore, is a task, a kingly task, one of the greatest and most
important inside the whole compass of life. Indeed, we may say that one
of the chief purposes of Masonry is to mobilise all men of goodwill in
order that they may help to brother the world into a world-wide
brotherliness.
