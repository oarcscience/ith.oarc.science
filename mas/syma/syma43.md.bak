### CHAPTER XXXIX

### THE LIBERAL ARTS AND SCIENCES

#### I

The educators of the Middle Ages taught seven branches of learning in
their school and these were divided as I have already said, into two
groups, the first of which was called the "trivium" (meaning "where
three roads meet"), and the second, "quadrivium" ("where four roads
meet"). Grammar, rhetoric, and logic, comprised the former group
usually, and it was these subjects that the young student in college
first studied: the latter group included arithmetic, music, astronomy,
and geometry. When all of these subjects were mastered the man was said
to have a "liberal education" and the school in which they were taught
was called (as it still is) a "college of liberal arts."

This educational system was in vogue when the earliest Operative lodges
were practising, and it was inevitable that the Masons, who refused to
permit their guild to become a mere labour organisation, should
incorporate the Liberal Arts and Sciences into their schemes of study
and in their literature. Brother Conder informs us that as early as the
fourteenth century the London Society of Masons "required the Master
Mason to be acquainted with the seven liberal sciences." In the "Ahiman
Rezon," a book of constitutions much used by the "Ancients" in the
eighteenth century, we have a reminiscence of this in the following bit
of doggerel:

<span id="page_236">p. 236</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

"The grammer rules instruct the tongue and pen,  
 Rhetoric teaches eloquence to men;  
 By logic we are taught to reason well,  
 Music has claims beyond our power to tell;  
 The use of numbers, numberless we find;  
 Geometry gives measure to mankind.  
 The heavenly system elevates the mind.  
 All those, and many secrets more,  
 The Masons taught in days of yore."

</div>

This doggerel is really a free paraphrase of a few lines from the oldest
of our Manuscripts, written about 1390, and it goes to show that for
four or five centuries the arts and sciences had held a prominent place
in the thought, as well as in the ritual and constitutions, of
Freemasons.

In the beginning of the eighteenth century the Liberal Arts and Sciences
were embedded in the First Degree after the revision of the ritual they
were moved to the Second Degree, where they very naturally served
Preston's scheme for making this degree a short course of instruction.
There they still remain; if they can no longer fulfil Preston's great
purpose they may still very fittingly serve to remind us of the place
which such culture must have in the life of every complete and
well-furnished Mason.

To enter into any detailed analysis of the seven subjects is obviously
impossible here, though it might prove more interesting than we would
think; but we may well ask ourselves, why are these arts and sciences
set in the middle of the Ritual? Why do the Lectures devote so much
space to them? What possible connection can they have with a man's
Masonic life? I believe that we can find a satisfactory answer to these
questions by recalling a bit of history.

<span id="page_237">p. 237</span>

During the so-called Dark Ages what few scholars there were in Europe
devoted themselves almost entirely to studies that had little or no
connection with human life; they debated such questions as, What are the
attributes of Deity? What are angels? What are demons? What is being?
What is existence? How many angels can stand on the point of a needle?
etc. After the great Revival of Learning had come, with its rediscovery
of history, of nature, of human life, and of classical literature, the
scholars turned from the old subjects to themes that were nearer to
life—history, the arts, science, politics, and so on. The men who took
up these studies were called Humanists because they were more interested
in questions related to the life and needs of humanity than they were to
the dry-as-dust discussion of metaphysics; and they urged in favour of
their new studies that they would "humanise" men who would pursue them.

#### II

I believe that Masonry is justified in retaining the Liberal Arts and
Sciences in its Ritual just because they still have power to humanise
us, to "improve us in social intercourse," to make us broader of mind,
more tolerant in opinion, more humane in action, and more brotherly in
conduct.

Besides, knowledge of them, even a little knowledge of them, can make us
more useful to the lodge. The brother who understands enough grammar to
write a paper to be read to his brethren; who has studied enough
rhetoric to learn how to speak well in open lodge; who has so
disciplined his mind by logic as to think straight and clear without
prejudice or passion; who has an appreciation of a fine art like music
so as to be mellowed and softened by the charm it throws about one's
personality; who has had

<span id="page_238">p. 238</span>

his mental outlook broadened and his store of knowledge enriched so as
to have useful information to place at the disposal of the Craft; such a
brother, it seems to me, is one who exemplifies the Masonic love of
light.

We may go a step further. Suppose a lodge member is critical, captious,
fault-finding, prejudiced, and ignorant; he adds nothing to the
Brotherhood and he is a cause of trouble. If the lodge could persuade
him to ascend the seven steps of the arts and sciences consider how it
would affect him; his prejudice and vanity would drop away, for these
are fruits of ignorance; his captiousness would vanish, for that comes
from a lack of culture; his enlarged mind would make him more tolerant
of others’ opinions and more patient with others’ faults, for great
knowledge always begets humility. The man who has captured even a little
vision of the wide world of knowledge can never be bigoted or
vainglorious because he has learned how little he himself really knows.
Masonry needs the Arts and Sciences for the sake of brotherhood itself!
