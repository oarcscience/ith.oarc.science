### CHAPTER VI

### THE CABLE TOW

#### I

The cowboy who "lassoes" a pony and the Laplander who throws a noose
about the neck of a reindeer are making use of a device for fettering
and controlling animals that was discovered by man long before the
beginnings of history. Because of the many uses to which he put the
rope, or noose, and because it was a natural thing for his imagination
to play about simple every day implements and experiences man early made
a symbol of the noose. It may be that the emblematic use of the rope
could be traced to yet other sources, but that given is reasonable
enough and may stand in our mind for a suggestion of the manner in which
symbols and emblems often come into existence. The candidate in a number
of the Ancient Mysteries was led into the place of initiation at the end
of a rope; Brahmins and Dervishes continue to make a similar use of it
at the present time. In every such case the noose, rope, or cable tow
has been used to signify control, obedience, and direction. (See "Ars
Quatuor Coronatorum," Vol. I, p. 264. Hereafter, in referring to these
familiar volumes, which contain the published transactions of a great
Lodge of Masonic Research of London, England, I shall use the well-known
initials, A.Q.C.)

This symbol, as every candidate has learned, is used in Masonic
ceremonies. When, by whom, and in what manner it was introduced there is
still an open question,

<span id="page_77">p. 77</span>

though our scholars have searched far and wide to discover. Its use may
have been borrowed from earlier fraternities; or it may have been
inherited from the Operative Lodges who may have used it for the purely
practical purpose of maintaining bodily control of the candidate. The
latter supposition receives a certain amount of support from the fact
that English lodges still give the cable tow a non-symbolical function,
and then in the First Degree only; and there are echoes of such a
meaning in the First Degree as practised here in the United States.

#### II

Mackey defines a cable tow as "a rope or line for drawing or leading"
and suggests that it may have been derived from the German "Kabeltau,"
which has that significance. Mackey adds that "the word is purely
Masonic" but this is not quite true because it is found in the Standard
Dictionary of 1913 and there defined as "a rope or line for drawing or
leading; in Freemasonry, symbolising in the Second and Third Degrees the
covenant by which Masons are bound." This last-named point is
inaccurate, as the reader will have instantly noted, because the cable
tow is used in the First as well as the other two degrees; this is one
more example of the woful ignorance of Freemasonry displayed by profane
editors of encyclopædias and dictionaries and reminds one how careful a
student should be to make sure of the authenticity of his sources of
information. Albert Pike traced the word back to the Hebrew "Khabel,"
which meant variously "a rope attached to an anchor" and "to bind as
with a pledge." J. T. Lawrence finds its origin in two languages:
"cabel," a Dutch word "signifying a great rope, which, being fastened to
the anchor, holds

<span id="page_78">p. 78</span>

the ship fast when she rides"; "tow" he believes to be a Saxon word
"which means to hale or draw and is applied, nautically, to draw a barge
or ship along the water."

### III

What does this symbol mean? Many have contended, Albert Pike among them,
that the cable tow is nothing more than a device for the bodily control
of the candidate; but this interpretation is not borne out by the Second
and Third Degrees in both of which it carries an undeniably symbolical
meaning. Others see in it an emblem of the natural untaught man's
bondage to ignorance and lust, which bondage it is the mission of
Masonry to remove. Of such an opinion is Arthur Edward Waite, who,
seeing in the rope a suggestion of the cord that binds the unborn babe,
or the babe newly born, to its mother's body, finds in the symbol a
representation of the gross earthly ties that hold unregenerated men to
their appetites and passions. In view of the fact that the symbolism of
rebirth runs through the Ritual this interpretation is not at all
far-fetched. Paton finds in the cable tow a "simple and natural tie
which unites the Fraternity": Lawrence sees it as "the Mystic Tie
binding the initiate to God, to the Order, and to Righteousness; a tie
which both binds and draws, and which holds a man fast, lest he drift
like a ship at sea." Churchward, who loves to go far afield, traces the
symbol back to ancient Egypt, where he believed himself to have
discovered so many Masonic origins, in whose Mysteries, some of them,
the candidate wore a chain about the neck "to signify their belief in
God and their dependence on Him." (See his "Signs and Symbols of
Primordial Man.") Others have believed that the cable tow is the symbol
of all bad obediences—obedience to lust, to passion,

<span id="page_79">p. 79</span>

selfishness, worldliness, etc., and consequently must be removed from
the emancipated finder of the Light: others have found in it the
opposite symbol of all good obediences—the ties that bind a man to his
fellows, to laws, to duty, and to ideals. The variety of these
interpretations tends to confuse one, especially a beginner in
symbolism, who is tempted to believe that where so many meanings are
found there cannot be any meaning at all; it must be remembered that a
symbol by its very nature says many things at once, things often the
most diverse, a function which is not the least of its many advantages.
Almost all great and simple words—love, patriotism, friendship,
immortality, God, etc.,—are similarly prolific of meanings, and so are
symbols or symbolical actions in every-day use, such as a flag, the wave
of a hand, or the tipping of one's hat.

#### IV

To my own mind the candidate is as a child struggling for release from
narrow environments and external restraints in order to enter into the
larger life of liberty and self-direction. The cable tow about his neck
symbolises all those external checks and restraints, such as
conventionality, fear of the world, fear of the adverse opinions or
displeasure of men, and of the control of teachers and parents on which
a child naturally depends but which must be thrown off when one has
reached full responsibility as a man "of mature age." The removal of the
noose symbolises the attainment of inward light, judgment and the power
of self-direction—in other words, real manhood, which has its centre and
support in an inward power that is stronger than any pressure from
without. Dr. Buck whom I have already quoted (I am not in agreement with
him in his interpretation of

<span id="page_80">p. 80</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Masonry as a
whole) has given us in words of admirable simplicity a noble exposition
of the true significance of this symbol:

"He \[the candidate\] is restrained now \[after the removal of the cable
tow\] by the voluntary obligations taken, all of which indicate the
necessity of constant vigilance and self-control. In place of the former
command—'thou shalt not'—comes the voluntary pledge—'I will.' The result
is to replace outer constraint by inward restraint, without annulling or
altering a single moral precept. The slave who formerly obeyed a Master
through fear, now voluntarily serves a Master through love. The
difference is that between a bondman and a freeman, and the result to
the candidate can hardly be put in words when it is once realised."
(*New Age*, Vol. vii, page 159.)

The homely practical truth and usefulness of all this interpretation may
be made instantly discernible by a simple example. In human society in
general, law, written or unwritten, is the cable tow that holds fast
every man. The good man cannot escape from it any more than a bad man,
and he who walks about his own yard, a free and respectable citizen, is
quite as much held fast by the law as he who sits sullenly in a prison
cell, denied the right of seeing the sun or of walking upon the grass.
But while these two men are equally held by law, the manner in which law
holds them is as different as day is from night; for whereas the
prisoner is held by it against his own will, the free man obeys it of
his own choice. The hope of the world depends upon those who "have the
law in their inward parts" and keep it because they love order and
security. Men and women who must be forced to keep order are a source of
social unhappiness; it is impossible to have a policeman at every man's

<span id="page_81">p. 81</span>

elbow. A wise and good citizen is one who inwardly understands why law
is necessary and what law is, and gives it a voluntary obedience, so
that nobody needs to stand by to force compulsion. Moreover, such a man
has learned that freedom is nothing other than the inward and voluntary
obedience, glad obedience, to wise and just laws. People of a low order
must be held fast by external force; in proportion as men and women
become advanced, external force becomes increasingly unnecessary, so
that in a truly civilised state, order rests on the inward character of
men. The savage has the rope about his neck; the civilised man has it in
his heart. It is not a question of tie or no tie; but of what kind of a
tie it is that holds a man to his fellows, to the state, and to his
duty.

#### V

As to the meaning of the expression "length of my cable tow" it is
somewhat difficult to speak, owing to the great variety of
interpretations that have been offered, a few of the more typical
examples of which may be here given. Pike sees in it "the scope and
intent and spirit of one's pledge." Brother Rev. F. de P. Castello,
writing on "The Geometry of Freemasonry" ("Author's Lodge Transactions,"
Vol. i, page 286), says, "The cable's length has always been understood
to be one of 720 feet, which is twice 360, the measure of the circle";
making one circle to stand for the spiritual in man, and the other for
the material, he believes the "length of my cable tow" to mean that, "I
will go as far in assisting my brethren as my moral principles and my
material condition will permit." In Mackey's Encyclopædia we may read:
"The old writers define the length of a cable tow, which they sometimes
called a 'cable's length,' to be three miles for an

<span id="page_82">p. 82</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Entered
Apprentice. But the expression is really symbolic, and, as defined by
the Baltimore Convention in 1842 \[a notable Masonic gathering\], means
the scope of a man's reasonable ability." With the Baltimore Convention
one may very well agree.
