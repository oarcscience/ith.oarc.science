### APPENDIX

### QUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION

The following paragraphs are designed solely for the use of Study Clubs
and such other classes or groups as may systematically study the ritual
of Freemasonry by means of the present book. The method pursued in
arranging these queries will be immediately apparent; they are
constellated in the same order as the chapters and numbered accordingly.
No attempt has been made to represent every point made, and often
questions have been devised for the purpose of leading discussion
outside of the limits imposed upon me in discussing "Symbolical
Masonry."

CHAPTER I: AN INTRODUCTION TO THE FIRST STEP

I.—When was the first Grand Lodge of Modern Speculative Freemasonry
organised? Where? What was the First Degree then called? How were Masons
made in Scotland? Where was the most complete Freemasonry then? What do
you know about the famous so-called "schism"? What had come to be the
condition of the Fraternity prior to 1717? What, do you suppose, brought
about this condition? How many degrees were there at the time of the
Revival? What was done with the old "First"? with the old "Third"? By
what date was the "three degree" system completed?

II.—What was "Operative Masonry"? What were the Old Charges? Give from
memory, and in substance, the picture of an old initiation as given by
Hawkins. In what essentials does that initiation differ from the one now
in use? What, do you suppose, was the Volume of the Sacred Law then
used? Was it the Holy Bible or was it the old Book of Constitutions?

<span id="page_310">p. 310</span>

What qualifications were required for initiation? What was an
"indenture"? how long did it last? why did it have to last so long? Were
the conditions of apprenticeship governed merely by the rules of the
Craft or were they also controlled by the laws of the state? To whom was
the Apprentice bound? What were the Apprentice's duties? What were the
moral requirements of an Apprentice? How could he become a Master?
where?

What does the word "Apprentice" mean? What is it to be a "learner"? How
did you set out to "learn" Masonry? Is Masonry, do you think, worth the
time and trouble of study, real study? Why is a learner said to be in
"the Porch"? What would be meant by "Solomon's Porch"? What are the
rights of an Apprentice to-day? what are his disqualifications? What is
meant by the phrase "in a symbolical sense"? What is a symbol? What is
symbolical language? Can you furnish an original example? In what sense
is it true that an Apprentice is "born into a new world"? What is meant
by obedience? Give examples of your own of how obedience must precede
mastery and freedom. Which is morally free, the man who obeys the moral
laws, or the man who disobeys them?

III.—What is an "art"? In what sense is life an art? What kind of a
building is it that a Speculative Mason is set to build? What are his
materials? what are his tools? Which is more difficult to build, a man
or a building? In how many various ways may the Apprentice be pictured?
In what sense is he a babe about to be born into a new world? in what
sense is Freemasonry a "new world"? Did you find it such? What was new
in it to you? What is the central idea in Dr. Buck's interpretation?
What can you find out about Dr. Buck? who was he? when did he live and
where? what did he do? Who is Dr. J. F. Newton? have you read his book,
"The Builders"? Does your lodge "put on" the First Degree with solemnity
an d beauty? How could you improve it?

CHAPTER II: PETITION FOR MEMBERSHIP

I.—What is the first step to be taken by one who desires admittance to
Freemasonry? What is contained in a petition? What are the
"constitutional questions"? When is the petition

<span id="page_311">p. 311</span>

read to the lodge? By whom? What is then done with it? What is an
investigating committee? Who must recommend a petition? What is done
when a petition is rejected? How is a petition rejected? Can a rejected
petitioner make another application? How? When? What is a
"jurisdiction"?

II.—Can you discover when the present laws governing petitions first
came into use? Give the main points covered in a petition. Tell what you
can about John Paul Jones as a Mason? Was his petition substantially the
same as yours?

III.—What change of conditions made an investigating committee
necessary? Have you ever served on such a committee? How did you perform
your functions? Do you believe it to be a good system? Among the last
dozen petitions presented to your own lodge how many have you known
personally? How can a Master of a lodge safeguard membership? How can he
hold a committee up to the highest standards? Have you ever known a
lodge to fall to a lower plane of usefulness through the poor materials
admitted to membership? if so, tell about it. Have you ever seen a
questionnaire? what questions were asked? What do you think of the use
of questionnaires? What are the objections? Under what conditions is the
questionnaire necessary? For what purposes is it necessary to have filed
such information as a questionnaire contains?

IV.—What is meant by "solicitation"? In what way does the problem of
solicitation lead a student into the inner soul of Masonry? In what way
is solicitation a wrong to the man solicited? What is he asked to swear
to at the door of the lodge when he comes to be initiated? In what way
does that conflict with his having been solicited? How would
solicitation be in danger of misleading him as to the real character of
the Order? Why is solicitation an evil to the Order? If solicitation
were freely permitted, in what way would it cause a deterioration in
Masonry? In this regard compare Masonry with other orders that encourage
solicitation. Have you had experience in such? what was the difference?

V.—To what extent can you go in acquainting your non-Masonic friends
with the history and principles of Freemasonry?

<span id="page_312">p. 312</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> How can you tell a
non-Mason what Masonry is? Who was Albert Pike? what great Masonic book
did he write?

CHAPTER III: THE BALLOT

I.—What is meant by a "ballot"? Describe the machinery of balloting now
employed in Masonry as you understand it. What kind of a man would make
bad material for the Fraternity? Do many such gain admission? If so,
how? Why is the ballot question so "irritating," as one brother is
quoted to have remarked? Could you devise improvements in the method?
What are the abuses that creep in under the present system? Could you
think of an entirely different system for selecting members?

II.—When is a petition put to the ballot? In how many cases is it one
month? two weeks? In how many jurisdictions is a re-ballot required for
the Second and Third Degrees? When may a rejected petitioner re-apply?
When can a member refrain from voting? What is meant by a "unanimous
ballot"? What is the universal custom in America? What is the practice
in your own lodge? What is the objection to the unanimous ballot? what
do you think about it? What system is employed in England? What may be
said in favour of the "three blackballs reject" rule? Does the ballot
exist in order to get good men in or to keep bad men out? What does
Gibson say about it? Are there landmarks to go by? What is to decide
what is the wisest system of balloting? What is the usual custom in
France? To what extent should the method of balloting be left optional
with the subordinate lodge?

III.—What is meant by "secrecy of ballot"? Do you believe in it? Who was
Dr. Mackey? Have you ever seen his system of landmarks? What custom of
balloting was used before 1720? Why did the methods for balloting
change? What is a viva voce vote? What are the objections to it? Why is
the present system "as good a method as can be devised"? Why is the
present system of balloting difficult to manage in a large lodge? How
can its difficulties be overcome? Has your Grand Lodge dealt with
balloting methods recently? What is meant by "Masonic jurisprudence"?

<span id="page_313">p. 313</span>

IV.—What is the difference between a Masonic ballot and any other? What
determines your choice of political candidates? Have you exactly the
same things in mind when you cast your ballot on a petition? In what way
does the ballot pass upon a petitioner's character? What are the
qualifications for membership in the Order? When should you vote against
a man? Should you vote for or against a petitioner who is a stranger to
you?

CHAPTER IV: "WORTHY AND WELL-QUALIFIED"

I.—What is meant by "qualifications"? Are they now too rigorous, do you
think? What is the "certain purpose" for which Freemasonry is organised?
What is the criterion by which the fitness of a candidate is judged? Who
was Tolstoy? what is the point of the quotation made from his book? How
would you defend the high demands made on candidates as against those
who criticise Freemasonry for being "aristocratic or exclusive"?

II.—What were the Old Charges? what are they otherwise called? Name the
oldest of them: what is its date? How does it describe the
qualifications of membership? Who was James Anderson? When was his
version of the constitution made? What qualifications are described in
it? What qualifications are demanded by your own Grand Lodge?

III.—Give your own reason why "no bondmen" could be admitted into
operative lodges.

Were women admitted to the old guilds? were they admitted to the Masonic
guilds? If not, why not? Who was Gould? what did he write? What is he
quoted to have said? What does MacBride say?

Give your own reasons at length why an immoral man cannot be admitted.
What is "an immoral man"?

IV.—Why does not Masonry accept bad men in order to make them better?
What are the reformative agencies in society?

Why cannot we admit women to membership? Under what conditions did
Freemasonry evolve into its present form?

<span id="page_314">p. 314</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> What would have to
be done in order to admit them? Are you in favour of it? To what would
you object? From what book are the verses quoted? Have you ever read a
History of Masonry? Can you name three such histories?

What is meant by "free born"? What does your own Grand Lodge require on
this point? What is Gibson quoted to have said?

What is meant by "mature" age? How old were Apprentices in operative
days? What have been the regulations in force in England with regard to
age? What are the rules in your own Grand Lodge? What is the point of
MacBride's comment? do you agree with him? Have you ever visited lodges
in a foreign country? How could a Grand Lodge maintain its requirement
for legal age in such wise as to enable a member to visit a jurisdiction
in which eighteen years is permitted?

V.—Why has the question of "physical qualifications" so long been a
storm-centre? Have you ever debated it? What does the Regius Manuscript
say about it? Why was physical soundness necessary in operative lodges?
What is the position maintained by the Grand Lodge of England? Why have
Grand Lodges in this land maintained the doctrine of physical
perfection? What is your own opinion about the matter? Give substance of
statement issued by the Board of General Purposes of England. Who was
Dr. Oliver? can you name any of his books? What was his position? Who
was T. S. Parvin? what position did he take?

VI.—What is meant by a "right motive"? Are you taking Masonry
"seriously"? Were you serious when you came in? What is said by Hughan?
Who was Hughan? What is a cowan? What is a "watch-fob Mason"?

CHAPTER V: THE HOODWINK

I.—Why is the question "Where were you prepared?" so important? In what
way does its answer reveal many of the secrets of Freemasonry. Why, do
you suppose, did the Ancient Mysteries demand a long process of
preparation? What can you tell about the Mysteries? How much of the
Ritual did you understand after you had completed your Third Degree?
What is meant by "prepared in the heart"? When is a candidate duly

<span id="page_315">p. 315</span>

and truly prepared? What kind of preparation room have you in your
lodge? How is it protected against jest and derisive remarks?

II.—How did Mackey describe the hoodwink? How would you yourself
describe it? What is the symbolical meaning of it? How long has the
hoodwink been used in initiations? Who were the Cathari? who was
Innocent III? In what sense is it true that the purpose of the hoodwink
is <span class="small">NOT</span> to hide things from the eyes of the
candidate? What effect did wearing the hoodwink have on you?

III.—What is meant by the word "revelation"? Give examples of your own
that explain its meaning. In what sense did Jesus, according to the
V.S.L., bring "life and immortality to light"? In what sense has love
ever been "the law of the world"? What did Newton discover? Watt?
Copernicus? Give other examples that would illustrate the same point.
What is the difference between "reveal" and "discover"? In what manner
may it be said that Freemasonry "confers the power of vision"?

IV.—What does Freemasonry reveal to us? How? In what sense has
brotherhood always been a reality, a "law of the world"? Does
Freemasonry create brotherhood? Define the kingdom of heaven. Can you
think of a better definition? In what sense was brotherhood "true"
during savage times? Does brotherhood seem like a frail tender thing to
you? In what sense is this an erroneous thought? What are the enemies of
brotherhood? What is the hoodwink that prevents men from discovering it
in their own lives? What is the real hoodwink? Give examples of this
same idea from religion, politics, and science.

CHAPTER VI: THE CABLE TOW

I.—Why was the noose whereby early man learned to control wild animals
of such great importance to him? What part did animals play in the life
of primitive man? (See "The Dawn of History," by J. L. Myres.) What led
primitive peoples to make symbolical use of tools and implements? Is the
symbolising process still going on? If so, give examples. Repeat the
examples

<span id="page_316">p. 316</span>

of the early use of the noose as a symbol given in the text. What is
meant by "A.Q.C."? How did Operative Lodges use the cable tow? What is
meant by "Operative Lodges"? How is the cable tow used in English
lodges? How used among us?

II.—How does Mackey define "cable tow"? The Standard Dictionary? What is
said by the author of this last definition? How is the term defined by
Pike? by Lawrence?

III.—What did the cable tow mean to you during your initiation? How
would you now interpret it? How does Pike interpret it? Do you agree
with him? If not, why not? What is Waite's opinion? Paton's?
Churchward's? Give the "obedience theory" of the cable tow. Give
examples of "bad" obediences; of "good." Why does a symbol always have
many meanings? In what sense is this an advantage? Give a list of
symbols, emblems, and symbolical acts in every day use about you.

IV.—Repeat the author's interpretation. Do you agree with it? Could you
write out your own interpretation? Give substance of Dr. Buck's
interpretation. In what sense are you bound by law as a candidate is
bound by the cable tow? Is law a thing that gives us liberty? or does it
take away liberty? Give examples of other "cable tows" that bind us in
every day life? How about the ties of friendship? marriage? business
contracts? Does the principle made clear by the interpretation of the
cable tow enable you the better to understand the meaning and use of all
human ties?

V.—In actual Masonic practice how do you interpret "the length in your
cable tow"? What does Castello say? Give Mackey's interpretation. What
was the Baltimore Convention? Would "the length of my cable tow" mean
the scope of your ability to <span class="small">ASSOCIATE</span> with a
brother as much as to <span class="small">ASSIST</span> a brother?
should it be given that larger interpretation?

CHAPTER VII: THE LODGE

I.—What is Pierson's theory of the meaning of the word "lodge"? Give the
various definitions of the word. What is

<span id="page_317">p. 317</span>

candidate knock for entrance? Give examples of the way in which one must
knock for entrance to the arts and sciences.

II.—How is Freemasonry defined to the candidate? How did MacBride define
Masonry? How does he define Speculative Masonry? Give Thomas Green's
definition. What is the Royal Arch definition? Give Dr. Buck's
definition. Give Brother Waite's definition. What is the author's
definition?

III.—How is Masonry defined from the point of view of architectural
symbolicism? What is it "which was lost"? What is Brother MacBride's
illustration of this idea? What is meant by a "drama of regeneration"?
In what way can Masonry be thus described?

IV.—What is meant by "a merely natural man"? How can one live the
eternal life now? Give Albert Pike's definition of Freemasonry.

<span id="page_318">p. 318</span>

CHAPTER IX: THE SHARP INSTRUMENT

I.—What is the meaning of "sharp instrument?" What is the only real
penalty? Why have penalties led to attacks on Freemasonry? What is
MacBride's theory concerning them? What are the actual penalties of
wrongdoing? What are the penalties for transgressing the laws of any
art.

CHAPTER X: INVOKING THE BLESSING OF DEITY

I.—What is the place of prayer in human life? What is Thorp's theory of
the Apprentice's prayer? Why is prayer found in the Masonic ceremonies?
In what way is prayer a force? How may prayer be described as "spiritual
work"?

II.—Why should man pray if God is all-knowing and all-powerful? Give
examples of the way in which God and man must work together. Why do men
pray? What are the effects of prayer? Do any other living beings on this
earth ever pray? Who was the author of the stanzas quoted? What do these
stanzas mean?

CHAPTER XI: CIRCUMAMBULATION

I.—What is the meaning of the word Circumambulation? From whom have we
inherited this rite? What do primitive people believe about the sun?
Among what people was the rite of Circumambulation practised? What is
said about the Greeks, Romans, Hindoos, Druids and early Christians? In
what way does Mackey compare Masonic Circumambulation with the Greek?

II.—How did the old Legends explain Circumambulation? What was Pike's
explanation? In what way is Circumambulation "a drama of the development
of the individual life"? What is Pierson's theory? What did
Circumambulation mean to you at the time of your initiation? What is the
last explanation given?

III.—What does the sun represent? In what way does Circumambulation
suggest "the secret of human accomplishment"? Give some examples of
this.

<span id="page_319">p. 319</span>

CHAPTER XII: APPROACHING THE EAST

I.—Into how many parts may the ceremony of approaching the East be
divided? Why did early peoples come to look upon the North as a place of
darkness? What does Fort say about the North in the Middle Ages? What
does Evans say about the symbolism of the North? Milton? Shakespeare?
Why is the North in the Masonic lodge the place of darkness? What is the
symbolism of the South? How did the church builders make use of this
symbolism? What part does the South play in a Masonic lodge? What is the
symbolical meaning of the West? Who was Sophocles? How does Tennyson use
the symbolism of the West? What does the East mean in a Masonic lodge?

dedicated? How was the city of Rome oriented? How were early Christian
churches situated? How did the Jews orient their temples? Why is the
Master's station in the East? How is the Masonic lodge oriented?

III.—What is the meaning of the approach to the East? What is the
Masonic ceremony of approaching the East? What is the meaning of that
ceremony? How do you approach the East in your daily life?

CHAPTER XIII: THE ALTAR

I.—Where does the Altar stand? How should the Altar be made? With what
should it be furnished? Where is the Masonic life lived? Of what is the
Altar a symbol? In what way is it the symbol of gratitude? What is the
theory of human stewardship?

II.—How was the Altar used as a sanctuary in early centuries? In what
way is the lodge a sanctuary? In what way is the Altar a station of
sacrifice? What is meant by sacrifice? How do you yourself make use of
sacrifice?

III.—Give in your own words the substance of the paragraph quoted from
Dr. Newton. Why is man a "seeker after God"?

<span id="page_320">p. 320</span>

CHAPTER XIV: THE OBLIGATION

I.—Define the word "obligation." Have oaths and obligations been in
universal practice? Why? Can you name oaths administered outside the
Fraternity with which the Masonic obligation may be compared? Are the
marriage oath, the President's oath, etc., such forms? Why is a
religious sanction thrown about an oath? Does the taking of an
obligation imply that the candidate cannot be trusted? Does it make his
obligation or does it define it? What does Tyler say about the
universality of oaths? How do Philo and Cicero define an oath? Can you
give a better definition of an obligation than any herewith offered? If
so, will you send it in to the Society?

What does Gould believe to have been the original of the Masonic oath?
Why was the oath taken by the freemen adopted into the forms of the
Masonic lodge? Do we see to-day any institutions copying the forms of
oaths employed by some other institution? Name them. Were the earliest
Masonic obligations short or long? How did the obligation evolve into
such length? Is this legitimate? Have any other parts of the ceremony
evolved similarly? Are Masonic ceremonies still changing and growing? If
so, why? If not, why not? What was the substance of the earliest
obligations? Why were the building secrets so jealously guarded? How did
these secrets come to be public property? What effect did such publicity
have upon the Freemasons?

What is the whole point of the present obligation? Have we any trade
secrets? If you believe that a simpler, more effective obligation might
be written, will you offer one? Why should Masonic secrets be still so
jealously guarded? What is the function of secrecy in Masonry? Does
friendship have its secrets? Business? Diplomacy? What would happen to
the Fraternity if it should abandon its policy of secrecy? Does secrecy
attract men to it? Why?

What is the meaning of "due form"? Whence came the term? What is the
difference between form and formality? When two friends meet do they
shake hands in "due form"? Does the form in which the obligation is
given add to its dignity and impressiveness? Do you permit any flippancy
in your own lodge's ceremony of initiation? Why not?

Why are the penalties kept so secret? How much can you

<span id="page_321">p. 321</span>

talk about Masonry without violating your obligation to secrecy? Did the
earliest obligations have any penalties attached? If not, why not? What
is the "Harleian Manuscript"? What is meant by "Old Charges"?

What do Old Testament writers seem to feel concerning the sea? When the
sailors cast Jonah overboard did they suppose they were putting him out
of reach of the God he had offended? Would you as soon be
[buried](errata.htm#4.md) in the sea as on the land? What is meant by
"consecrated ground"? What churches still bury their dead in consecrated
ground? Why? Does the custom of setting apart a special tract of ground
for burial add dignity to the thought of death? Would you as soon think
yourself dead lying in the sea as lying in a grave?! Who added the
present penalties to our obligations? When? What hint do you get from
Brother Clegg's suggestions?

II.—Why have anti-Masons so rabidly attacked the obligation? Is a man
scared by penalties which he knows will never be inflicted? Who was John
Quincy Adams? Why did he fight the Fraternity? Do you agree with what
Brother MacBride says about the obligation? If not, why not? If you do,
why? Is there any way in which the obligation could be recast? Who would
have the authority to do so? Would it be of any advantage to have a
General Grand Lodge of America to take care of such matters?

Why is the cable tow removed when it is? What does it signify? Is the
obligation an appeal to a man's sense of honour? Or is it a slam against
his sense of honour? Does the wedding oath add to or detract from the
stability and dignity of marriage?

If marriages were left to private wills could the law have any control
over them? How could Masonic law be brought to bear upon a man who had
never taken an obligation? What is the real "Masonic Tie"? Does that tie
draw you to other Masons? Does it ever restrain you from doing a wrong
to a brother Mason? Why?

CHAPTER XV: THE THREE GREAT LIGHTS

I.—Why is the Holy Bible called the V. S. L.? To what extent are the
materials in our ritual drawn from it? In what

<span id="page_322">p. 322</span>

sense is the Bible true? What constitutes its "unity"? How many books in
it? Can you tell how these books came to be gathered together? Can you
tell the difference between the canon (or "collection") of books used as
the Bible by the Greek Catholics, the Roman Catholics, and the
Protestants? What is inspiration? In what way is the Bible inspired?

What does "infallible" mean? Is the Bible infallible as history? As a
book of science? In what way is it infallible? If it is infallible in
any manner at all how can we prove it? How can its teachings be
verified? How are scientific teachings verified?

Of what is the Bible a symbol? What are the sacred books of other races?
When, and for what reason, can those books be substituted for the Bible
on a Masonic altar? In what manner can other sacred books serve as a
symbol of that of which the V. S. L. is the symbol?

II.—In how many ways is the Square used in our ritual? Describe the
Square as it is used Masonically. Why did early peoples think that the
earth was cubical or square-shape? How did the Square come to have its
present significance? What is the Great Light of which it is a symbol?
Why do we say of an honest man that he is "square"? What do we mean by
"the square deal"? Why do we say that a dishonest man is "crooked"? Is
dishonesty ever justifiable? Is a dishonest man like one who walks in
the dark? Why?

III.—Why did ancient peoples believe the heavens to be circular? What
did the Compasses signify to them? What do they signify to us? Do you
believe that there is a divine element in you? Is there a divine element
in a murder? How can we discover the divine in others? and in ourselves?
How can we learn to let it rule us? Explain the various positions of the
Compasses with relationship to the Square and explain the reason for
this.

CHAPTER XVI: THE LESSER LIGHTS

I.—What are the Lesser Lights? What is meant by Hermetic? What was the
Hermetic symbolical explanation of the sun? of the moon? Give
illustrations of the way in which nature is divided between male and
female, active and passive.

<span id="page_323">p. 323</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Who was John
Woolman? What kind of a nature did he have? Who was Friedrich Nietzsche?
What did he stand for? Who were Isis, Osiris, Horus? What does the
Worshipful Master represent in Masonic symbolism?

II.—What is Steinbrenner's theory of the Lesser Lights? How could this
symbol have been suggested by lodge windows? What do you think about
Steinbrenner's theory? What did the Lesser Lights mean to you?

CHAPTER XVII: "LUX E TENEBRIS"

I.—Repeat in your own words Brother Newton's paragraph about light. What
was the nature of the first religions of the world? Repeat quotation
from Norman Lockyer. Who is Norman Lockyer? What does he say about the
Egyptians and their beliefs concerning the Sun? Why did ancient peoples
worship light?

II.—What does the Bible say about light and darkness? Who was
Jamblichus? Zoroaster? What is the meaning of "Lux e Tenebris"? Why are
Masons called the sons of light? In what way does initiation bring a
candidate to light? What is meant by light in Masonry? What is the
difference between truth and knowledge?

III.—What meaning does the author give to the symbolism of light? In the
world at large? In the individual? What is the word that Masonry utters
to man? What is the lost word?

CHAPTER XVIII: WORDS, GRIPS AND TOKENS

I.—Give examples of the use of secret modes of recognition in past
times. What does Gould say about the use of signs, grips, etc.? Why, do
you suppose, are these "common features" of all secret societies? In
what way do they protect secrecy? Why should secrecy be protected? Can
you name any political, social, religious, or literary clubs which
employ secret modes of recognition? If so, why do they use them?
Chemists and druggists employ arbitrary signs to stand for various
formulæ, and these are understood only by themselves. Are such signs
analogous to our own?

<span id="page_324">p. 324</span>

II.—What evidence is there to show that Freemasons used signs in old
times? Why is the evidence so slender? Why were not these signs
published and explained? What is the point of the quotation from
Fergusson? Even if the early Operative Masons had been able to read and
write, could they have dispensed with their signs and grips? We can all
read and write: why have we not dispensed with them?

Can you guess what the Scotch "Mason Word" may have been? What was the
significance of "words" among Masons in other countries at that time?
How, and for what purpose, do we use words? Can you define a "password"?
What are its usages and advantages? Does the army employ passwords? Why?
What other organisations do so? In what way is "Word" used in the Third
Degree? What is the meaning of "The Lost Word"?

III.—What is the "Due Guard"? Why was it invented and taken up by
American lodges? What is the meaning of "an Americanism" as Mackey
employs the term?

In what way are grips and tokens different from passwords? Can you give
any examples of your own use of these outside the lodge room? When we
say we have given a friend "a token of our esteem" do we use the word in
its Masonic sense? Why are Masons entitled to use secret modes of
recognition? Can you give reasons not given in this paper?

CHAPTER XIX: THE RITE OF SALUTATION

I.—What is the meaning of "salutation"? How is it used in general
society? Is tipping your hat to a lady a salutation? Why does a private
salute an officer in the army? Give all the reasons you can think of to
explain why the candidate should salute the Wardens. In what way do they
represent the law and authority of the lodge?

What is there in the principles of Masonry that has ever caused it to be
the champion of liberty? Can you offer examples not given in the paper?
Can you tell the story of Masonry's part in the Revolutionary War? What
great leaders in that day were Masons? Was Lafayette a Mason?
Washington? Franklin? Where was the Bible obtained on which Washington
took his oath of office?

<span id="page_325">p. 325</span>

II.—Can liberty exist in a monarchy as well as in a democracy? What is
the difference between "freedom" and "liberty"? Between "liberty" and
"independence"? Can a nation be independent without enjoying liberty?
Did Italy secure liberty when she gained independence from Austria and
France? What is a "free thinker"? Are Masons "free thinkers"? Why is law
necessary to liberty? What would become of liberty if laws were
destroyed?

What does law do for us in our daily life? Why should a man desire to be
free? What are the advantages of freedom? What are the relations between
liberty and authority? Are they opposed to each other? Why are Masons
bound to uphold the dignity of law and order? What is meant by "civil
scepticism"? Does the habit of speaking sarcastically of law and of
courts help to uphold man's respect for social order? What should be a
Mason's attitude toward the laws of his own community? Suppose, as was
the case in Italy, that Masonry itself were declared unlawful, should a
Mason under such circumstances oppose the law? If so, why? In what way
should such opposition be different from lawlessness?

Is the desire to substitute a good law for a bad law, lawlessness? How
were the laws of Masonry instituted? How are they enforced? In what way
do they protect the liberty of each member? Would you say that the
Masonic organisation is a constitutionalism or a democracy? What is the
difference?

CHAPTER XX: THE APRON

I.—Why has the apron been interpreted so variously? Give,; a list of the
interpretations you have heard. Why is it dangerous to seek for
symbolisms in the present shape and size of the apron? How long has it
had its present shape and size? If the shape and size has changed from
time to time is it safe to build any symbolism thereon?

II.—Can you give any examples of non-Masonic use of the apron not
mentioned in the text? Why, do you suppose, has the apron been so widely
used? Why did the Operative Mason wear an apron? What do you imagine its
material and size to have been? If it was once of leather, why? Why was
it changed to its present material? Why is the apron we usually wear in

<span id="page_326">p. 326</span>

lodge different from that given to us during initiation? What led
Speculative Masons to change its material and shape? Give usual
dimensions of aprons as worn in American lodges. Why are they sometimes
varied for different degrees and offices?

III.—What is a badge? What is the badge of a Mason? What is the
difference between a badge and an emblem? A symbol? Has the Masonic use
of the apron done anything to wear down the old prejudice against manual
labour? Why were men ever so prejudiced? How long has it been since the
prejudice began to break down? What were the causes? What are the
labours of a Mason? Are they of any great value to society?

IV.—In what way is the apron as now used the symbol of sacrifice and
innocence? Why have men so frequently thought of white as a symbol of
innocence? Give examples of the early use of the colour as such symbol.
What is the meaning of innocence? How can a grown man be innocent? What
is the Masonic meaning of innocence?

What do you think of Brother Crowe's argument as given in the text? Why
is the lamb the symbol of sacrifice? Can you give examples from the
Bible of such a meaning? What is sacrifice? Why is sacrifice necessary?
What is a Mason's sacrifice?

What was the Golden Fleece? The Roman Eagle? Star and Garter? Why is the
apron more ancient and honourable than these? How would it affect human
society if all men accepted the Masonic meaning of toil, innocence and
sacrifice?

CHAPTER XXI: DESTITUTION

I.—What is the significance of the way in which the candidate is
prepared? What is the difference between humility and humiliation? Why
should the symbols in a Masonic lodge cause a man to feel humility? What
is meant by discalceation? What is Mackey's interpretation of
discalceation? What is the meaning of this ceremony in the terms of
every-day life?

II.—What is the meaning of the word holy? What does the Holy Bible teach
concerning holiness? What is meant by sacredness? What is astrology?
alchemy? What was the

<span id="page_327">p. 327</span>

astrological theory about the influence of planets? What does A. E.
Waite say about destitution? What is your theory of destitution?

CHAPTER XXII: THE NORTHEAST CORNER

I.—Why is the candidate "reinvested with that of which he had been
divested"? Why not wait until the end of the degree? What means
"Northeast"? Is a boy halfway through school standing in education's
"Northeast"? What is the Masonic meaning of "profane"? Why is the North
a place of darkness and the East a place of light? Why is an Entered
Apprentice said to be midway between the two? Do you know of any members
of your lodge who are still in the Northeast? Has your study club helped
you to find the East?

Describe the posture of the candidate as he stands in the Northeast
Corner. Why is he made to stand thus? When is a man morally upright?

What is the function of a cornerstone in a building? Have you ever
attended a ceremony of cornerstone laying? If so, describe what
happened. Why a ceremony? What would you describe as a cornerstone of
government? Of education? Of religion? In what way is the Entered
Apprentice the cornerstone of Masonry?

Describe the cornerstone ceremonies in early times. Why was a living man
sacrificed? What is the real meaning of sacrifice? Have you ever made
sacrifices for Masonry? In what way has the Fraternity a right to expect
sacrifices from its members? Would you agree with this definition of
Masonic sacrifice: "Masonic sacrifice is the surrendering of all that
conflicts with the principles of Masonry"? Name some things which men
commonly do that would so conflict. What sacrifice has Masonry as a
whole been making during the war—not subordinate lodges, but the Craft
as a whole?

II.—What is your opinion of human nature? Do you believe that man is by
nature depraved? Is our hope for the race built on what man is now, or
on his capacities? What can be meant by the divinity of man?

Has man a capacity for the god-like? If so, how does Masonry appeal to
that? How does Masonry help to develop

<span id="page_328">p. 328</span>

it? What is the point of Brother Markham's poem? Do you agree with him?
Is it mere sentimentalism to deal with men in such a way as to call out
the best that is in them? In what way does Masonry make its appeal to
the best that is in us?

CHAPTER XXIII: WORKING TOOLS OF AN ENTERED APPRENTICE

I.—What can you add to the quotation from Carlyle? What particular
accomplishment of man is cited by Bergson to distinguish man from brute?
In what manner do the tools of the brute differ from those of man? How
has man's superiority over the brute developed? Where does man's
superiority lie?

What is the key to Masonry's use of the "working tools"? What is their
use? How are they symbolised? What is the ultimate design to be
accomplished by the use of the working tools of Masonry? Can a Mason
shape his own destiny or be instrumental in shaping the destiny of
others without the aid of his Masonic working tools?

Why is not the newly initiated candidate at once intrusted with all the
working tools or implements of Masonry? With what tools is he intrusted
and instructed in the Masonic application of, in the Entered Apprentice
degree? in the Fellow Craft degree? in the Master Mason degree?

II.—What is a "twenty-four inch guage"? Of what is it the symbol, in our
Monitors? Give the Monitorial exposition of the twenty-four inch guage
in the language of the standard "work" of your Grand Jurisdiction. What
reference to it was made by the old writers in connection with Saints
Ambrose and Augustine and King Alfred? Do you agree with what the author
says regarding the right use and division of time? If not, why not?

What is your definition of "Time"? What definition of it does the author
give? Does Time symbolise to you opportunities to be grasped and
improved upon? Who wastes time, the laggard or the successful man? Do
you consider it a waste of time to attend the Study Club meetings of
your lodge or Study Club? Are you wasting time by not attending these
meetings? Are you applying the twenty-four inch guage to your time as
did Abraham Lincoln and Albert Pike and other busy men?

<span id="page_329">p. 329</span>

What is the fundamental reason for so many men developing into "human
failures"? How may we protect ourselves against becoming failures in
life? How has man heretofore divided his actions? What test should we
apply to our actions? What foundation are Masons laying for the morality
of the future? What great secret have we to learn from the twenty-four
inch guage?

III.—What was the symbolism of the gavel in the Middle 'Ages? Whence was
this symbolism derived? Of what was the gavel a symbol in Scandinavian
mythology? What other peoples attribute to it the same symbolism? What
is the Masonic derivation of the gavel? Give the Monitorial reference o
the gavel as used in the standard "work" of your Grand Jurisdiction. Is
the common gavel a symbol of authority? How is it distinguished from the
implement of authority wielded by the Master of a lodge? What functions
are combined in the common gavel? What is Mackey's explanation of its
probable derivation? What use did the Operative Masons make of the
common gavel? What is a "knob" on a stone? an "excrescence"? What do
these suggest to the author? Do you agree with him in his deductions? If
not, why not?

Does Masonry demand more from its members in the foregoing respect than
do other organizations of their members or employés? What is the first
lesson to be learned by a soldier, or an employé of a corporation? Why
must they learn this lesson? Is "team work" and "co-operation" necessary
to the success of a lodge? of a Grand Lodge? of Masonry as a whole?
Could Masonry successfully cope with the questions which are arising
each day in connection with the great work of reconstruction which the
world is now facing, without some such united organisation as the
recently launched "Masonic Service Association of the United States"?
Did the necessity of "team work" and "co-operation" demand the
organisation of such a Body?

CHAPTER XXIV: AN INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND STEP

I.—What is the meaning of the term Fellow Craft? What were the Schaw
Statutes? What do they say about Fellow

<span id="page_330">p. 330</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Craft? What was a
Mason's mark? What was the ceremony of passing in Operative lodges? When
was the term introduced into England? What was the old-time meaning of
Fellow Craft? How did the term come to have its present meaning?

II.—What was a masterpiece? What is the key word of the Second Degree?
Who was William Preston? What did he set out to do? Who was Hemming?
When were his lectures adopted? Who was Philip Webb? What was the
dominating idea in Preston's time? What did Preston do with the Second
Degree?

III.—What does Pound say about Preston's theory? What is your own theory
concerning the matter? What did the Second Degree mean to you when you
were initiated?

CHAPTER XXV: PASSING

I.—What is the meaning of indentured? What space of time do American
Jurisdictions require between the First and Second Steps? What does
Gould say about marks in Solomon's Temple? How did Operative Masons use
the mark? What is meant by essay? How could present-day lodges make use
of the old custom of the essay or masterpiece?

II.—What do you think about the memory test? What was an intender? What
is the function of custodians of the work? How could the Fraternity
carry on schools of Masonry? What should be demanded of a candidate who
wishes to pass from the First to the Second Degree?

CHAPTER XXVI: SQUARE ON THE BREAST

I.—What is meant by the phrase "arts, parts and points," etc., familiar
to every Mason? What teaching do they convey? Is a Mason expected to be
square and upright only in his dealings with members of the Fraternity?
What has always been expected of him in his relations to the Craft? Is a
Fellow Craft under any stronger tie to the Fraternity than he was as an
Apprentice? Why?

What was the original meaning of virtue? What is its

<span id="page_331">p. 331</span>

present-day definition? What is your definition of "rectitude"? Should
Masons be content with merely observing the conventions of society, or
should they strive to be active at all times in things that tend toward
a higher plane of morality?

II.—Of what is the breast a symbol in Masonry? What are we to realise
from the Fellow Craft application of the square? Has the man who has two
codes of ethics, one of which he practises for effect in his own
community and the other when away from home and among strangers, fully
learned the truth designed to be conveyed by the application of the
square? What kind of a moral code does Masonry demand that its votaries
follow?

CHAPTER XXVII: THE SCRIPTURE READING FROM AMOS

I.—What custom was observed by the Greeks during their ceremony of
Circumambulation? Why did this custom obtain? What similar custom is
practised in Masonic lodges of the present day? Why?

What did Amos seek to do in his day? What is the end to which the Fellow
Craft should apply the knowledge gained in his Masonic studies? What was
the state of society during the time of Amos? What penalty was inflicted
upon Amos because of his teachings? What was Amos’ method of teaching?

II.—What picture does Amos portray to us in the Scripture reading? What
is the author's interpretation of the reading? Have you a better
interpretation?

What was the lesson learned by Job? Can we expect to escape from
punishment for our wrongdoings?

CHAPTER XXVIII: THE OBLONG SQUARE

I.—In what particular does the Fellow Craft's approach to the East
differ from that of the Entered Apprentice? What is the significance of
this variation? Prior to the time of reading this chapter, did you ever
try to discover the origin and meaning of the term "oblong square"? If
so, what did you learn concerning it?

<span id="page_332">p. 332</span>

What is Mackey's definition? What reference does he find in it? Whence
does he seek to trace this reference? What inference does the author
take from Mackey's deductions?

II.—What other interpretations are cited by the author? What objections
are advanced to these interpretations? How are squares classed by
Brother Hunt? Do you agree with him in his deductions? If not, why not?
How is Brother Hunt's theory supported by Irwin?

What theory does the author advance as to the possible manner in which
the "oblong square" was handed down to us? What lesson does he think the
framers of our present-day ritual intended to convey when they retained
the phrase?

CHAPTER XXIX: DUE FORM

I.—Describe the "due form" assumed by the candidate in the Fellow Craft
degree. In certain jurisdictions whenever the signs are given the
brethren must also be on the step of that particular degree at the same
time. It is held that the signs cannot be properly given unless this is
done. The brethren thus place themselves in due form to give the signs.
Try this, and see if the body is not thus brought into the proper
position to facilitate giving the signs properly. Then try giving them
without first being "on the step." Possibly you will thereby discover
the reason for practising such "forms."

Define the words "form" and "formality." What is a "formalist"? What is
"formality"? Is "form" necessary in our every-day business and social
life? Is it necessary in Masonry? If so, for what purpose? Why do we use
the term "due form"? Is a candidate expected to comply with these "due
forms"? What does his compliance signify?

CHAPTER XXX: WORKING TOOLS OF A FELLOW CRAFT

I.—What are the working tools of a Fellow Craft? How have you explained
them to yourself? What is their meaning in your understanding now? Why
do you always think of goodness, holiness, heaven, God, as being above
you? What is the

<span id="page_333">p. 333</span>

difference, in your judgment, between morality and righteousness? Do you
think of your ideal of your own life as being above and beyond you? If
so, what efforts are you making to attain to that ideal? May this not be
one of the suggestions in this working tool of the plumb?

What do you mean by "a hero"? How can a man erect himself above himself?
What influence has the memory of Washington, Pike, Jefferson and Lincoln
had for you? In what way may a true Mason be a hero to his friends? his
family? his race?

II.—What do you understand yourself when you use the word "level"? Do
you really believe that you are equal in all ways to every other
individual? Is every other individual equal to you in all ways? If there
are fundamental differences between you and other individuals, just what
is the nature of these differences? What do you understand by "pride"?
"superciliousness"? In what way are all Masons on a level with each
other? What becomes of your pride when you sincerely stand in a lodge
room on a level with your brother countryman?

III.—How would you explain the meaning of the square when that symbol is
used as one of the working tools of a Fellow Craft? How can the sense of
manly pride and the feeling of equality be joined together in your own
experience? Do you really use your gifts to help your brethren and to
help others in this world? How can a healthy man use his own strength to
help those that are ill? How can a learned man use his learning to help
those that are ignorant? How can a man who has money really help those
that have little or no money? Should not we try to help others in such a
way that they do not even know that we are helping them? How should
parents help their children? How should teachers help their pupils?

How may the Master and officers of a lodge help the members of that
lodge without their knowing it? What is meant by not letting your right
hand know what your left hand is doing?

CHAPTER XXXI: THE ASHLARS

I.—What is your understanding of the Ashlar symbolism? hat is meant by
saying that a profane man, using the word in

<span id="page_334">p. 334</span>

a Masonic sense, is but like a rough block of stone? Is not an ignorant,
unclean, profane, dishonest, unbrotherly man like an unshaped piece of
rough rock from the quarry? If you know of such a man, how can you help
him to become a man more square, cultured and brotherly? What is the
Masonic Fraternity as a whole now doing, in your own honest estimation,
to help this old world to cease to be a wreck of a world?

II.—Is not this present world but a great crude piece of rock in your
eyes? What can our Fraternity do to help make this living human race
more square with the everlasting laws of life, righteousness, health,
happiness and God? Which are you in your own lodge—a rough ashlar or a
perfect ashlar? What do you do with the members of your lodge who make
trouble? Do you grow impatient with them, or do you help them? You see
that all these questions are designed to lead Masonic students to
understand that Freemasonry tries to help us in our daily lives.

CHAPTER XXXII: THE MIDDLE CHAMBER

I.—In what light have you heretofore interpreted the existence of the
"Middle Chamber" of Solomon's Temple—as a literal fact or simply as a
symbol? What is Sir Charles Warren's opinion? What is Mackey's opinion
regarding it? Do you agree with them? If not, what reasons have you for
disagreeing with them?

What is the modern Biblical interpretation of the term "chamber" as used
in the present connection? How many such chambers were there in the
Temple, and what were their uses? Were they used as "paymaster's
offices," or as chambers of instruction?

What is a "myth"? Were our ceremonies contrived as vehicles for the
conveyances of historical facts to candidates? What thought should we
continually bear in mind while pursuing our Masonic studies?

Of what is the Middle Chamber a symbol? What does it represent in the
Second Degree ritualism? How are we benefited by "learning" or
education?

What part does the Second Degree occupy in Ancient Craft

<span id="page_335">p. 335</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Masonry? Would the
system have been complete without it? Have you gained a new conception
of the Second Degree from this section of the author's present study
paper from that which you formerly held of it?

CHAPTER XXXIII: OPERATIVE AND SPECULATIVE

I.—Describe Operative Masonry. Why did Operative Masonry decline? Give
substance of MacBride's theory? What specific elements existed in
Operative Masonry? What is Mac-Bride's theory about this? Give substance
of A. E. Waite's theory. What elements in modern Masonry could not have
come from Operative Masonry? What did Speculative Masonry inherit from
Operative Masonry? What is Masonry's general idea concerning the world?
What is the point of the Browning poem?

How were builders organised in mediæval times, and for what purpose? Why
were they intrusted with signs, words and grips? why were they called
"Operative" Masons?

Why were persons who had no connection with the building trades admitted
into the Order prior to 1717? What attracted them to it? What was the
result of their admittance?

How does Brother MacBride describe the transition from Operative to
Speculative Masonry?

What influence has the speculative element on the operative
organisation?

What did the non-operative element undertake to do after their
acceptance into the organisation, according to Brother Waite? How were
Kabbalistic and Rosicrucian ideas and symbols introduced into the Order?

What did Speculative Masonry inherit from the Operatives? Was all of our
philosophy and mysticism handed down from the Operatives?

What was the work of the Operative Mason, and what were his wages? What
is the work of the Speculative Mason, and what are his wages?

Do you believe with those who claim that the race cannot be improved;
that because evils of one kind and another have always existed, that
they are always to remain with us? What is the mission of Masonry?

<span id="page_336">p. 336</span>

CHAPTER XXXIV: THE TWO GREAT PILLARS

I.—Why did early peoples set up pillars before their places of abode,
about their villages and over the graves of their dead? What did they
believe such pillars to symbolise? What did pillars portray to the Mayas
and Incas? How were they looked upon in Bible times? By whom were
monoliths most widely used? In what manner, and for what purposes? In
the course of religious development what did they come to symbolise?
What did the obelisk symbolise?

Whence did the custom of placing pillars before temple entrances proceed
from Egypt? What did Hiram probably use as his models for the pillars
placed before Solomon's Temple?

What do the pillars used in the lodge room represent? What is the height
of the pillars as given in the Book of Kings? In the Book of Chronicles?
What is the author's theory concerning these variations? How does Mackey
describe the original pillars?

II.—What was the shape and composition of the pillars? What was their
combined weight? What were they respectively called and what were their
positions? How are these names interpreted Masonically? What part did
they occupy during celebrations? Where were the pillars supposedly cast?

What should be the height of the pillars used in our lodge rooms? What
are the heights as adopted by American Grand Lodges? What was the height
of the pillars as now accepted by present-day authorities? Is it
imperative that we know the actual height of the pillars to pursue our
Masonic studies? In what light should we consider them?

What did the pillars symbolise to Preston? To Caldecott? To Covey-Crump?
To Mackey? To the old Jewish Rabbis? What is the author's
interpretation?

Where do you keep the pillars in your lodge room during the time they
are not in actual use? Has such position any particular significance? In
some jurisdictions we find them at either side of the entrance from the
preparation room; in others they stand in front of the Senior Warden's
station. Can you give a reason for either or both of these locations
other than "for convenience"? How did the pillars impress you when you
first saw them? What do they mean to you now?

<span id="page_337">p. 337</span>

CHAPTER XXXV: THE GLOBES

What are the two globes called? Why are they so-called? Describe the
Egyptian symbol of the Winged Globe. What is the objection to the theory
that our globes came from Egypt? What is the author's theory of the
origin of the globes? Why did Preston give the globes a place in the
Second Degree? What do the two globes represent? What sciences deal with
the earth? What sciences deal with the heavens? In what way can a Mason
gain enlightenment from this science?

What two theories have been offered by Masonic scholars concerning the
origin of the globes? How was the first theory suggested? What is the
symbol of the winged globe? What did its oval shape suggest or
symbolise? Do you accept this Egyptian theory? If so, why? If not, why
not?

Why does it appear that Preston modified the chapiters of the pillars
into globes? How is Preston's theory verified? Do you agree with the
author that we of to-day have the same right to interpret the symbols in
our own way as did the ancients? If not, why not?

CHAPTER XXXVI: THE ASCENT

I.—To what extent is the origin of the symbolism of the Winding Stairs
generally known? Is it essential that we discover the exact facts in
order to intelligently pursue our present study?

Have there ever been advanced satisfactory answers concerning the source
of the symbolism? To what extent should discussion of the origin be
considered of value?

Do you agree with the contention of early scholars that there was
actually a winding stair of three, five or seven steps in Solomon's
Temple? What can you offer in support of such contention? Could the
semicircular stairway at the Gate Nicanor where the Levites chanted the
"Psalms of Degrees" have been taken as the prototype of our winding
stairs? What is your opinion concerning this theory? What does Sir
Charles Warren say concerning the staircase?

What is the "Theological Ladder"? When and by whom was it introduced
into the ritual? What was the symbolism of

<span id="page_338">p. 338</span>

the "Theological Ladder"? Have we anything similar to it in our ritual
of the present day? What does the author say about this interpretation?

What is the theory of the Operative origin of the symbolism? Can this
theory be depended upon? If not, why not?

Since the origin of the Winding Stair symbolism cannot be accurately
traced, how should we view the use of the stairs in our work?

II.—What does the use of the mystical numbers suggest to you? Of what is
the Winding Stair as a whole a symbol?

What is Pike's theory concerning the number "15"? What would happen
should our present symbolic arrangement of the Winding Stairs be
changed? Would a change be of any material advantage?

Is the use of numbers in symbolism of modern origin? Can you give a
reason for even numbers being used to denote earthly or human things and
odd numbers to suggest divine or heavenly truths? Has this always been
the case?

What was "the number of the beast" and its interpretation? How were
ancient temples usually approached? Why should we feel gratified that
the symbolism of odd numbers is retained in Masonry?

What is the "triad" or "ternary"? How was it considered by philosophers?

III.—How does the author explain the number "5"?

Of what is the number "7" the symbol? How was knowledge divided in
mediæval times? What does Gould say about the seven sciences?

How can our ritual be made to be of assistance to us in our every-day
life?

What is our most familiar explanation of the "three steps"? How does
Masonry help the individual? Should a Mason feel that he is being left
apart and alone in his endeavours to improve his physical and spiritual
condition?

What great lesson is revealed to us in the five steps?

How is the group of seven steps interpreted? Is this teaching a
necessity? Does Masonry approve ignorance? Is the expression "I have no
time to read or study" one of yours? How did Burritt, Franklin,
Livingstone and others secure their education? What grows out of
ignorance?

<span id="page_339">p. 339</span>

Do you believe that the human race is still progressing? What must we
avoid in measuring progress? In what manner alone can the human race
progress? What are your answers to the author's closing questions?

CHAPTER XXXVII: THE BUILDERS

I.—Why, do you suppose, were so many allusions to the art of
Architecture incorporated in our Ritual and monitorial lectures? What
was Preston's idea in the formation of the Second Degree Lecture? What
advantage has the boy or man of our day over the Masons of Preston's
time?

What is Morris’ definition of Architecture? Is a structure erected with
a view of catering to physical needs only worthy of being designated as
"architecture"?

Is Morris’ definition borne out by facts?

What do the Parthenon and the colonnades at Thebes tell us? What part
did art play in the Middle Ages?

To what have the buildings of men always had a reference? What is the
story of the Tower of Babel?

II.—What is the secret of Masonry's use of architecture? How are Masons
at present interested in building? Is the use of builder's tools as
symbols of modern origin? Is such symbolism to be found in the Bible?
Can you quote illustrations? Are similes in use at the present day? Name
some of them. In what sense do we usually speak of a "builder"? a
destroyer? Is there a connection between the present-day mission of
Masonry and the language of architecture? From what source do we derive
our Masonic institution of the present day?

Is a Mason an "architect"? Why? What manner of a structure is each
individual Mason engaged in the building?

Do you agree with the author's assertion that Masonry is a
"world-builder"? If so, why? If not, why not? When will Masonry's work
be completed?

CHAPTER XXXVIII: THE FIVE SENSES

I.—What part of the ceremonies or lectures most impressed you on the
night you took your Second Degree? How were you impressed by the lecture
on the "Five Senses"? How have

<span id="page_340">p. 340</span>

you expressed or carried out your impressions? Have you ever given the
matter any further thought? Have you "Masonized" your Five Senses?

What thought have you gained from the author's short discourse on the
part played by the senses in a man's life? What is the underlying idea
of the series of paintings in the Congressional Library at Washington
mentioned by the author?

In what direction should our senses be trained?

II.—How does the author interpret the sense of feeling? the sense of
tasting? the sense of smelling? the sense of hearing? the sense of
seeing?

III.—Can you give a different interpretation of any or all of these
senses?

What important lesson has the author endeavoured to emphasise in the
present chapter? What new understandings have you gained from the
foregoing pages?

CHAPTER XXXIX: THE LIBERAL ARTS AND SCIENCES

I.—How many branches of learning were taught in the schools of the
Middle Ages? What were these two groups called? What is the meaning of
"trivium"? "quadrivium"? What branches comprise these two groups? What
does Conder say about the London Society of Masons? What was the Ahiman

your conception of its symbolic meaning? Did you accept the ritualistic
explanation as authentic and final? Or had you at any time subsequent to
receiving your Second Degree investigated the subject from other

CHAPTER XLII: AN INTRODUCTION TO THE THIRD STEP

I.—In a study of the Third Step shall we expect to find architectural
symbolism as in our preceding studies? In what terms were the teachings
in First and Second Steps given to us? Of what will our new studies
treat?

Who originated our Third Degree? and when? Have these questions ever
been satisfactorily answered?

How many degrees were there at the beginning of the Grand Lodge period?
What were they? Why was the old Apprentice Degree divided into two
parts? When was this division made?

Did this change meet with unanimous approval? Was the new degree
universally worked immediately after the division? Why was the new
degree so slow to meet with universal approval? Was it welcomed by
Masons outside of London?

Who is believed to have been responsible for the introduction of this
new material?

II.—What was the new material introduced between 1723 and 1738? Why does
the author not believe that it was the Hiram Abiff legend? What is the

elaborate from the first as it is now? Is it worked uniformly in all
countries? In all Grand Jurisdictions in the United States?

<span id="page_343">p. 343</span>

CHAPTER XLIII: THE VITAL PARTS OF THE BREAST

I.—At the time you received your Third degree what particular impression
did the method of reception make upon you? Did you look upon this
particular part of the ceremony as simply a matter of routine, or did
you endeavour to think out for yourself the true meanings of the words
"friendship, morality and brotherly love"?

Can a man who lives a secluded life apart from his fellows be said to
know the true meaning of happiness? Has the friendship of fellow-members
of your own lodge and those of other lodges with whom you have come into
close contact been a help to you since you became a member of the
Fraternity? Has this friendship caused you to change your opinion of any
of the fellow-members of your own lodge with whom you had but a speaking
acquaintance prior to your becoming a Mason? Has your own mind been
broadened by such friendships?

CHAPTER XLV: THAT WHICH WAS LOST

1.—What is the master symbol of Blue Lodge symbolism? Why should we be
cautious in our endeavours to ascertain the origins of the symbolism of
the "Lost Word"?

How were brethren in the early days of Masonry sometimes "made Masons"?
Have our researchers yet been able to discover what the "Lost Word" was?
What would those who hold to the theory that the Royal Arch Word is the
"Lost Word" lead us to believe? Is there any evidence to prove beyond a
doubt that this word was really the "Lost Word"?

II.—Do you agree with the author that the "Lost Word" was never a
component part of the Blue Lodge work which was later taken away from
the Blue Lodge and transplanted into the Royal Arch Degree? If so, what
are your grounds for so agreeing? If not, what are your reasons for
disagreeing with him?

What is the Legend of the Tetragrammaton? What was the custom among the
Jewish people relative to pronouncing the name of Deity? How was the use
of the name restricted? What finally became the penalty inflicted upon

Apprentice, and their uses? What are the working tools of a Fellow
Craft, and their uses? What is the function of a Trowel in the hands of
a Master Mason? Why is the Trowel most symbolic in the work of temple
building?

II.—Of what power may we consider the Trowel to be a symbol?

What do we say of men who lack unity in their makeup? Whence came the
word "character"? What is its present-day meaning? What may a man who
lacks character do to better himself?

What can he use to accomplish this end?

How did the builders of ancient times lay out their building designs?

their position held to by later writers? What are we to infer from
findings of more recent times?

Had the Jews a tradition of the Grand Master's death? Can we deny
positively that the Legend is not historically true? What is the belief
of other writers, who do not agree with the historical theory? When do
they believe the drama to have had its inception? What are the
assertions of Speth and Marks?

Legend of the Third Degree, and opened up any new thoughts on the
subject? If so, what are they? (A general question.)
