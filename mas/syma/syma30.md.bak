### CHAPTER XXVI

### SQUARE ON THE BREAST

#### I

In the earliest of the Old Charges we find fifteen "points" or rules set
forth for the regulation of the conduct of the Fellow Craft; these were
the "perfect points" of his entrance to the Order as well as in his
transactions with mankind, and it is worthy of note that this code of
ethics was far in advance of the standards of the fifteenth century.
There is no need to analyse these requirements except to say that they
consisted, in essence, of *acting on the square*, that is, the candidate
was to deal squarely with the Craft, with his masters, his fellows, and
with all men whomsoever. In his relations with the Craft he was expected
above all else to keep an *attentive ear* to his instructors, to
preserve carefully the secrets of his Order and his brethren in a
*faithful breast*, and to be evermore ruled by the principle of virtue
in his behaviour. If such qualifications were demanded of Apprentices in
an Operative trade, how much more may they be reasonably required of a
Fellow Craft in a speculative, or moral, science!

In its original form *virtue* meant valour; to-day it means rectitude.
But the rectitude which is virtue is more than a passive *not-doing* of
evil; it is the courageous *doing* of right. "Virtue is but heroic
bravery, to *do* the thing thought to be true, in spite of all enemies
of flesh or spirit, in despite of all temptations or menaces." The man
of conventional morality is content *not to* steal,

<span id="page_176">p. 176</span>

drink, gamble, swear, etc., but often it does not enter his head that
there is an active, aggressive work to be done in cleaning up the world.
Conventional morality is neuter; virtue is masculine; and the Craft that
seeks to *build* the Temple of Humanity needs in its votaries something
more than passive morality.

#### II

Many of the most vital organs are in the breast. A man can go without
water for days; he can do without food, if necessary, for a month or
more; but without breath in his lungs or blood in his heart he cannot
live an hour. The breast, accordingly, is the symbol of the most
essential things in personality,—love, faithfulness, purity, and
character. If the square is applied to the breast it is to compel us to
realise that virtue must rule in the very deeps of us, in the springs of
conduct, and the motives of action, as well as on the surface. The man
whose morality is on the outside of his skin is held up by external
restraints and will often fall into evil if they chance to be removed,
as the deacon of a church or the pillar of a community will sometimes
wallow in vice while among strangers. But when virtue is the law of the
hidden motives of the will, the man will walk as uprightly in the slum
of a city as in the precincts of his home. Should Masonry trust to
conventional morality alone it would build on sands; by demanding virtue
of its members it lays its foundations in bed-rock, and the storm may
come, the winds blow, the rains fall, but its house will not be moved.
And the same virtue that it requires in the lodge room, it expects in
all a Mason's transactions with mankind, else Masonic virtue itself
becomes a lifeless conventionality.
