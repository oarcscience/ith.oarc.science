### XVII.

### KNIGHT OF THE EAST AND WEST.

THIS is the first of the Philosophical Degrees of the Ancient and
Accepted Scottish Rite; and the beginning of a course of instruction
which will fully unveil to you the heart and inner mysteries of Masonry.
Do not despair because you have often seemed on the point of attaining
the inmost light, and have as often been disappointed. In all time,
truth has been hidden under symbols, and often under a succession of
allegories: where veil after veil had to be penetrated before the true
Light was reached, and the essential truth stood revealed. The Human
Light is but an imperfect reflection of a ray of the Infinite and
Divine.

We are about to approach those ancient Religions which once

<span id="page_247">p. 247</span>

ruled the minds of men, and whose ruins encumber the plains of the great
Past, as the broken columns of Palmyra and Tadmor lie bleaching on the
sands of the desert. They rise before us, those old, strange, mysterious
creeds and faiths, shrouded in the mists of antiquity, and stalk dimly
and undefined along the line which divides Time from Eternity; and forms
of strange, wild, startling beauty mingled in the vast throngs of
figures with shapes monstrous, grotesque, and hideous.

The religion taught by Moses, which, like the laws of Egypt, enunciated
the principle of exclusion, borrowed, at every period of its existence,
from all the creeds with which it came in contact. While, by the studies
of the learned and wise, it enriched itself with the most admirable
principles of the religions of Egypt and Asia, it was changed, in the
wanderings of the People, by everything that was most impure or
seductive in the pagan manners and superstitions. It was one thing in
the times of Moses and Aaron, another in those of David and Solomon, and
still another in those of Daniel and Philo.

At the time when John the Baptist made his appearance in the desert,
near the shores of the Dead Sea, all the old philosophical and religious
systems were approximating toward each other. A general lassitude
inclined the minds of all toward the quietude of that amalgamation of
doctrines for which the expeditions of Alexander and the more peaceful
occurrences that followed, with the establishment in Asia and Africa of
many Grecian dynasties and a great number of Grecian colonies, had
prepared the way. After the intermingling of different nations, which
resulted from the wars of Alexander in three-quarters of the globe, the
doctrines of Greece, of Egypt, of Persia, and of India, met and
intermingled everywhere. All the barriers that had formerly kept the
nations apart, were thrown down; and while the People of the West
readily connected their faith with those of the East, those of the
Orient hastened to learn the traditions of Rome and the legends of
Athens. While the Philosophers of Greece, all (except the disciples of
Epicurus) more or less Platonists, seized [eagerly](errata.htm#4.md) upon
the beliefs and doctrines of the East,--the Jews and Egyptians, before
then the most exclusive of all peoples, yielded to that eclecticism
which prevailed among their masters, the Greeks and Romans.

Under the same influences of toleration, even those who embraced
Christianity, mingled together the old and the new, Christianity

<span id="page_248">p. 248</span>

and Philosophy, the Apostolic teachings and the traditions of Mythology.
The man of intellect, devotee of one system, rarely displaces it with
another in all its purity. The people take such a creed as is offered
them. Accordingly, the distinction between the esoteric and the exoteric
doctrine, immemorial in other creeds, easily gained a foothold among
many of the Christians; and it was held by a vast number, even during
the preaching of Paul, that the writings of the Apostles were
incomplete; that they contained only the germs of another doctrine,
which must receive from the hands of philosophy, not only the systematic
arrangement which was wanting, but all the development which lay
concealed therein. The writings of the Apostles, they said, in
addressing themselves to mankind in general, enunciated only the
articles of the vulgar faith; but transmitted the mysteries of knowledge
to superior minds, to the Elect,--mysteries handed down from generation
to generation in esoteric traditions; and to this science of the
mysteries they gave the name of Γνῶσις; \[Gnosis\].

The Gnostics derived their leading doctrines and ideas from Plato and
Philo, the Zend-avesta and the Kabalah, and the Sacred books of India
and Egypt; and thus introduced into the bosom of Christianity the
cosmological and theosophical speculations, which had formed the larger
portion of the ancient religions of the Orient, joined to those of the
Egyptian, Greek, and Jewish doctrines, which the Neo-Platonists had
equally adopted in the Occident.

Emanation from the Deity of all spiritual beings, progressive
degeneration of these beings from emanation to emanation, redemption and
return of all to the purity of the Creator; and, after the
re-establishment of the primitive harmony of all, a fortunate and truly
divine condition of all, in the bosom of God; such were the fundamental
teachings of Gnosticism. The genius of the Orient, with its
contemplations, irradiations, and intuitions, dictated its doctrines.
Its language corresponded to its origin. Full of imagery, it had all the
magnificence, the inconsistencies, and the mobility of the figurative
style.

Behold, it said, the light, which emanates from an immense centre of
Light, that spreads everywhere its benevolent rays; so do the spirits of
Light emanate from the Divine Light. Behold, all the springs which
nourish, embellish, fertilize, and purify the Earth: they emanate from
one and the same ocean; so from the

<span id="page_249">p. 249</span>

bosom of the Divinity emanate so many streams, which form and fill the
universe of intelligences. Behold numbers, which all emanate from one
primitive number, all resemble it, all are composed of its essence, and
still vary infinitely; and utterances, decomposable into so many
syllables and elements, all contained in the primitive Word, and still
infinitely various; so the world of Intelligences emanated from a
Primary Intelligence, and they all resemble it, and yet display an
infinite variety of existences.

It revived and combined the old doctrines of the Orient and the
Occident; and it found in many passages of the Gospels and the Pastoral
letters, a warrant for doing so. Christ himself spoke in parables and
allegories, John borrowed the enigmatical language of the Platonists,
and Paul often indulged in incomprehensible rhapsodies, the meaning of
which could have been clear to the Initiates alone.

It is admitted that the cradle of Gnosticism is probably to be looked
for in Syria, and even in Palestine. Most of its expounders wrote in
that corrupted form of the Greek used by the Hellenistic Jews, and in
the Septuagint and the New Testament; and there was a striking analogy
between their doctrines and those of the Judeo-Egyptian Philo, of
Alexandria; itself the seat of three schools, at once philosophic and
religious--the Greek, the Egyptian, and the Jewish.

Pythagoras and Plato, the most mystical of the Grecian Philosophers (the
latter heir to the doctrines of the former), and who had travelled, the
latter in Egypt, and the former in Phœnicia, India, and Persia, also
taught the esoteric doctrine and the distinction between the initiated
and the profane. The dominant doctrines of Platonism were found in
Gnosticism. Emanation of Intelligences from the bosom of the Deity; the
going astray in error and the sufferings of spirits, so long as they are
remote from God, and imprisoned in matter; vain and long-continued
efforts to arrive at the knowledge of the Truth, and re-enter into their
primitive union with the Supreme Being; alliance of a pure and divine
soul with an irrational soul, the seat of evil desires; angels or demons
who dwell in and govern the planets, having but an imperfect knowledge
of the ideas that presided at the creation; regeneration of all beings
by their return to the κόσμος νοητός, \[kosmos noe\_tos\], the world of
Intelligences, and its Chief, the Supreme Being; sole possible mode of
re-establishing that primitive

<span id="page_250">p. 250</span>

harmony of the creation, of which the music of the spheres of Pythagoras
was the image; these were the analogies of the two systems; and we
discover in them some of the ideas that form a part of Masonry; in
which, in the present mutilated condition of the symbolic Degrees, they
are disguised and overlaid with fiction and absurdity, or present
themselves as casual hints that are passed by wholly unnoticed.

The distinction between the esoteric and exoteric doctrines (a
distinction purely Masonic), was always and from the very earliest times
preserved among the Greeks. It remounted to the fabulous times of
Orpheus; and the mysteries of Theosophy were found in all their
traditions and myths. And after the time of Alexander, they resorted for
instruction, dogmas, and mysteries, to all the schools, to those of
Egypt and Asia, as well as those of Ancient Thrace, Sicily, Etruria, and
Attica.

The Jewish-Greek School of Alexandria is known only by two of its
Chiefs, Aristobulus and Philo, both Jews of Alexandria in Egypt.
Belonging to Asia by its origin, to Egypt by its residence, to Greece by
its language and studies, it strove to show that all truths embedded in
the philosophies of other countries were trans-planted thither from
Palestine. Aristobulus declared that all the facts and details of the
Jewish Scriptures were so many allegories, concealing the most profound
meanings, and that Plato had borrowed from them all his finest ideas.
Philo, who lived a century after him, following the same theory,
endeavored to show that the Hebrew writings, by their system of
allegories, were the true source of all religious and philosophical
doctrines. According to him, the literal meaning is for the vulgar
alone. Whoever has meditated on philosophy, purified himself by virtue,
and raised himself by contemplation, to God and the intellectual world,
and received their inspiration, pierces the gross envelope of the
letter, discovers a wholly different order of things, and is initiated
into mysteries, of which the elementary or literal instruction offers
but an imperfect image. A historical fact, a figure, a word, a letter, a
number, a rite, a custom, the parable or vision of a prophet, veils the
most profound truths; and he who has the key of science will interpret
all according to the light he possesses.

Again we see the symbolism of Masonry, and the search of the Candidate
for light. "Let men of narrow minds withdraw," he says, "with closed
ears. We transmit the divine mysteries to

<span id="page_251">p. 251</span>

those who have received the sacred initiation, to those who practise
true piety, and who are not enslaved by the empty trappings of words or
the preconceived opinions of the pagans."

To Philo, the Supreme Being was the Primitive Light, or the Archetype of
Light, Source whence the rays emanate that illuminate Souls. He was also
the Soul of the Universe, and as such acted in all its parts. He Himself
fills and limits His whole Being. His Powers and Virtues fill and
penetrate all. These Powers \[Δυνάμεις, dunameis\] are Spirits distinct
from God, the "Ideas" of Plato personified. He is without beginning, and
lives in the prototype of Time \[αιων, aion\].

His image is THE WORD \[Λογος\], a form more brilliant than fire; that
not being the *pure* light. This LOGOS dwells in God; for the Supreme
Being makes to Himself within His Intelligence the types or ideas of
everything that is to become reality in this World. The Logos is the
vehicle by which God acts on the Universe, and may be compared to the
speech of man.

The LOGOS being the World of Ideas \[κοσμος νοητος\], by means whereof
God has created visible things, He is the most ancient God, in
comparison with the World, which is the youngest production. The LOGOS,
*Chief of Intelligence*, of which He is the general representative, is
named *Archangel, type and representative* of all spirits, even those of
mortals. He is also styled the man-type and primitive man, Adam Kadmon.

God only is Wise. The wisdom of man is but the reflection and image of
that of God. He is the Father, and His WISDOM the mother of creation:
for He united Himself with WISDOM \[Σοφια, Sophia\], and communicated to
it the germ of creation, and it brought forth the material world. He
created the ideal world only, and caused the material world to be made
real after its type, by His LOGOS, which is His speech, and at the same
time the Idea of Ideas, the Intellectual World. The Intellectual City
was but the *Thought* of the Architect, who meditated the creation,
according to that plan of the Material City.

The Word is not only the Creator, but occupies the place of the Supreme
Being. Through Him all the Powers and Attributes of God act. On the
other side, as first representative of the Human Family, He is the
Protector of men and their Shepherd.

God gives to man the Soul or Intelligence, which exists before the body,
and which he unites with the body. The reasoning

<span id="page_252">p. 252</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Principle comes
from God through the Word, and communes with God and with the Word; but
there is also in man an irrational Principle, that of the inclinations
and passions which produce disorder, emanating from inferior spirits who
fill the air as ministers of God. The body, taken from the Earth, and
the irrational Principle that animates it concurrently with the rational
Principle, are hated by God, while the rational soul which He has given
it, is, as it were, captive in this prison, this coffin, that
encompasses it. The present condition of man is not his primitive
condition, when he was the image of the Logos. He has fallen from his
first estate. But he may raise himself again, by following the
directions of WISDOM \[Σοφια\] and of the Angels which God has
commissioned to aid him in freeing himself from the bonds of the body,
and combating Evil, the existence whereof God has permitted, *to furnish
him the means of exercising his liberty*. The souls that are purified,
not by the Law but by light, rise to the Heavenly regions, to enjoy
there a perfect felicity. Those that persevere in evil go from body to
body, the seats of passions and evil desires. The familiar lineaments of
these doctrines will be recognized by all who read the Epistles of St.
Paul, who wrote after Philo, the latter living till the reign of
Caligula, and being the contemporary of Christ.

And the Mason is familiar with these doctrines of Philo: that the
Supreme Being is a centre of Light whose rays or emanations pervade the
Universe; for that is the Light for which all Masonic journeys are a
search, and of which the sun and moon in our Lodges are only emblems:
that Light and Darkness, chief enemies from the beginning of Time,
dispute with each other the empire of the world; which we symbolize by
the candidate wandering in darkness and being brought to light: that the
world was created, not by the Supreme Being, but by a secondary agent,
who is but His WORD \[the Λογος\], and by types which are but his ideas,
aided by an INTELLIGENCE, or WISDOM \[Σοφια\], which gives one of His
Attributes; in which we see the occult meaning of the necessity of
recovering "the Word"; and of our two columns of STRENGTH and WISDOM,
which are also the two parallel lines that bound the circle representing
the Universe: that the visible world is the image of the invisible
world; that the essence of the Human Soul is the image of God, and it
existed before the body; that the object of its terrestrial life is to
disengage itself of its body or its

<span id="page_253">p. 253</span>

sepulchre; and that it will ascend to the Heavenly regions whenever it
shall be purified; in which we see the meaning, now almost forgotten in
our Lodges, of the mode of preparation of the candidate for
apprenticeship, and his tests and purifications in the first Degree,
according to the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite.

Philo incorporated in his eclecticism neither Egyptian nor Oriental
elements. But there were other Jewish Teachers in Alexandria who did
both. The Jews of Egypt were slightly jealous of, and a little hostile
to, those of Palestine, particularly after the erection of the sanctuary
at Leontopolis by the High-Priest Onias; and therefore they admired and
magnified those sages, who, like Jeremiah, had resided in Egypt. "The
wisdom of Solomon" was written at Alexandria, and, in the time of St.
Jerome, was attributed to Philo; but it contains principles at variance
with his. It personifies Wisdom, and draws between its children and the
Profane, the same line of demarcation that Egypt had long before taught
to the Jews. That distinction existed at the beginning of the Mosaic
creed. Moshah himself was an Initiate in the mysteries of Egypt, as he
was compelled to be, as the adopted son of the daughter of Pharaoh,
*Thouoris*, daughter of *Sesostris-Ramses*; who, as her tomb and
monuments show, was, in the right of her infant husband, Regent of Lower
Egypt or the Delta at the time of the Hebrew Prophet's birth, reigning
at Heliopolis. She was also, as the reliefs on her tomb show, a
Priestess of HATHOR and NEITH, the two great primeval goddesses. As her
adopted son, living in her Palace and presence forty years, and during
that time scarcely acquainted with his brethren the Jews, the law of
Egypt compelled his initiation: and we find in many of his enactments
the intention of preserving, between the common people and the
Initiates, the line of separation which he found in Egypt. Moshah and
Aharun his brother, the whole series of High-Priests, the Council of the
70 Elders, Salomoh and the entire succession of Prophets, were in
possession of a higher science; and of that science Masonry is, at
least, the lineal descendant. It was familiarly known as THE KNOWLEDGE
OF THE WORD.

AMUN, at first the God of Lower Egypt only, where Moshah was reared \[a
word that in Hebrew means Truth\], was the Supreme God. He was styled
"*the Celestial Lord, who sheds Light on hidden things*." He was the
source of that divine life, of which the *crux ansata* is the symbol;
and the source of all power, He

<span id="page_254">p. 254</span>

united all the attributes that the Ancient Oriental Theosophy assigned
to the Supreme Being. He was the πλήρωμα (Pleroma), or "Fullness of
things," for He comprehended in Himself everything; and the LIGHT; for
he was the Sun-God. He was unchangeable in the midst of everything
phenomenal in his worlds. He *created* nothing; but everything
*emanated* from Him; and of Him all the other Gods were but
manifestations.

The Ram was His living symbol; which you see reproduced in this Degree,
lying on the book with seven seals on the tracing-board. He caused the
creation of the world by the Primitive Thought \[Εννοια, Ennoia\], or
*Spirit* \[Πνευμα, Pneuma\], that issued from him by means of his
*Voice* or the WORD; and which *Thought* or *Spirit* was personified as
the Goddess NEITH. She, too, was a divinity of *Light*, and mother of
the Sun; and the Feast of Lamps was celebrated in her honor at Sais. The
Creative *Power*, another manifestation of Deity, proceeding to the
creation conceived of in her, the Divine *Intelligence*, produced with
its Word the Universe, symbolized by an egg issuing from the mouth of
KNEPH; from which egg came PHTHA, image of the Supreme Intelligence as
realized in the world, and the type of that manifested in man; the
principal agent, also, of Nature, or the creative and productive Fire.
PURE or RE, the Sun, or Celestial Light, whose symbol was ☉, the point
within a circle, was the son of PHTHA; and TIPHE, his wife, or the
celestial firmament, with the seven celestial bodies, animated by
spirits of genii that govern them, was represented on many of the
monuments, clad in blue or yellow, her garments sprinkled with stars,
and accompanied by the sun, moon, and five planets; and she was the type
of Wisdom, and they of the Seven Planetary Spirits of the Gnostics, that
with her presided over and governed the Sublunary world.

In this Degree, unknown for a hundred years to those who have practised
it, these emblems reproduced refer to these old doctrines. The lamb, the
yellow hangings strewed with stars, the seven columns, candlesticks, and
seals all recall them to us.

The Lion was the symbol of ATHOM-RE, the Great God of Upper Egypt; the
Hawk, of RA or PHRE; the Eagle, of MENDES; the Bull, of APIS; and three
of these are seen under the platform on which our altar stands.

The first HERMES was the INTELLIGENCE or WORD of God. Moved with
compassion for a race living without law, and wishing

<span id="page_255">p. 255</span>

to teach them that they sprang from His bosom, and to point out to them
the way that they should go \[the books which the first Hermes, the same
with Enoch, had written on the mysteries of divine science, in the
sacred characters, being unknown to those who lived after the flood\],
God sent to man OSIRIS and Isis, accompanied by THOTH, the incarnation
or terrestrial repetition of the first HERMES; who taught men the arts,
science, and the ceremonies of religion; and then ascended to Heaven or
the Moon. OSIRIS was the Principle of Good. TYPHON, like AHRIMAN, was
the principle and source of all that is evil in the moral and physical
order. Like the Satan of Gnosticism, he was confounded with Matter.

From Egypt or Persia the new Platonists borrowed the idea, and the
Gnostics received it from them, that man, in his terrestrial career, is
successively under the influence of the Moon, of Mercury, of Venus, of
the Sun, of Mars, of Jupiter, and of Saturn, until he finally reaches
the Elysian Fields; an idea again symbolized in the Seven Seals.

The Jews of Syria and Judea were the direct precursors of Gnosticism;
and in their doctrines were ample oriental elements. These Jews had had
with the Orient, at two different periods, intimate relations,
familiarizing them with the doctrines of Asia, and especially of Chaldea
and Persia;--their forced residence in Central Asia under the Assyrians
and Persians; and their voluntary dispersion over the whole East, when
subjects of the Seleucidæ and the Romans. Living near two-thirds of a
century, and many of them long afterward, in Mesopotamia, the cradle of
their race; speaking the same language, and their children reared with
those of the Chaldeans, Assyrians, Medes, and Persians, and receiving
from them their names (as the case of Danayal, who was called
Bæltasatsar, proves), they necessarily adopted many of the doctrines of
their conquerors. Their descendants, as Azra and Nahamaiah show us,
hardly desired to leave Persia, when they were allowed to do so. They
had a special jurisdiction, and governors and judges taken from their
own people; many of them held high office, and their children were
educated with those of the highest nobles. Danayal was the friend and
minister of the King, and the Chief of the College of the Magi at
Babylon; if we may believe the book which bears his name, and trust to
the incidents related in its highly figurative and imaginative style.
Mordecai,

<span id="page_256">p. 256</span>

too, occupied a high station, no less than that of Prime Minister, and
Esther or Astar, his cousin, was the Monarch's wife.

The Magi of Babylon were expounders of figurative writings, interpreters
of nature, and of dreams,--astronomers and divines; and from their
influences arose among the Jews, after their rescue from captivity, a
number of sects, and a new exposition, the mystical interpretation, with
all its wild fancies and infinite caprices. The *Aions* of the Gnostics,
the *Ideas* of Plato, the *Angels* of the Jews, and the *Demons* of the
Greeks, all correspond to the *Ferouers* of Zoroaster.

A great number of Jewish families remained permanently in their new
country; and one of the most celebrated of their schools was at Babylon.
They were soon familiarized with the doctrine of Zoroaster, which itself
was more ancient than Kuros. From the system of the Zend-Avesta they
borrowed, and subsequently gave large development to, everything that
could be reconciled with their own faith; and these additions to the old
doctrine were soon spread, by the constant intercourse of commerce, into
Syria and Palestine.

In the Zend-Avesta, God is Illimitable Time. No origin can be assigned
to Him: He is so entirely enveloped in His glory, His nature and
attributes are so inaccessible to human Intelligence, that He can be
only the object of a silent Veneration. Creation took place by emanation
from Him. The first emanation was the primitive Light, and from that the
King of *Light*, ORMUZD. By the "WORD," *Ormuzd* created the world pure.
He is its preserver and judge; a Being Holy and Heavenly; Intelligence
and Knowledge; the First-born of Time without limits; and invested with
all the Powers of the Supreme Being.

Still he is, strictly speaking, the *Fourth* Being. He had a *Ferouer*,
a pre-existing Soul \[in the language of Plato, a *type* or *ideal*\];
and it is said of Him, that He existed from the beginning, in the
primitive *Light*. But, that *Light* being but an element, and His
*Ferouer* a type, he is, in ordinary language, *the First-born* of
ZEROUANE-AKHERENE. Behold, again, "THE WORD" of Masonry; the *Man*, on
the Tracing-Board of this Degree; the LIGHT toward which all Masons
travel.

He created after his own image, six Genii called *Amshaspands*, who
surround his Throne, are his organs of communication with inferior
spirits and men, transmit to Him their prayers, solicit for

<span id="page_257">p. 257</span>

them His favors, and serve them as models of purity and perfection. Thus
we have the *Demiourgos* of Gnosticism, and the six *Genii* that assist
him. These are the Hebrew Archangels of the Planets.

The names of these *Amshaspands* are Bahman, Ardibehest, Schariver,
Sapandomad, Khordad, and Amerdad.

The fourth, the Holy SAPANDOMAD, created the first man and woman.

Then ORMUZD created 28 *Izeds*, of whom MITHRAS is the chief. They
watch, with *Ormuzd* and the *Amshaspands*, over the happiness, purity,
and preservation of the world, which is under their government; and they
are also models for mankind and interpreters of men's prayers. With
*Mithras* and *Ormuzd*, they make a *pleroma* \[or complete number\] of
30, corresponding to the thirty Aions of the Gnostics, and to the
*ogdoade*, *dodecade*, and *decade* of the Egyptians. *Mithras* was the
Sun-God, invoked with, and soon confounded with him, becoming the object
of a special worship, and eclipsing *Ormuzd* himself.

The third order of pure spirits is more numerous. They are the
*Ferouers*, the THOUGHTS of Ormuzd, or the IDEAS which he conceived
before proceeding to the creation of things. They too are superior to
men. They protect them during their life on earth; they will purify them
from evil at their resurrection. They are their tutelary genii, from the
fall to the complete regeneration.

AHRIMAN, second-born of the Primitive Light, emanated from it, pure like
ORMUZD; but, proud and ambitious, yielded to jealousy of the First-born.
For his hatred and pride, the Eternal condemned him to dwell, for 12,000
years, in that part of space where no ray of light reaches; the black
empire of darkness. In that period the struggle between *Light* and
*Darkness*, *Good* and *Evil*, will be terminated.

AHRIMAN scorned to submit, and took the field against ORMUZD. To the
good spirits created by his Brother, he opposed an innumerable army of
Evil Ones. To the seven *Amshaspands* he opposed seven *Archdevs*,
attached to the seven Planets; to the *Izeds* and *Ferouers* an equal
number of *Devs*, which brought upon the world all moral and physical
evils. Hence *Poverty*, *Maladies*, *Impurity*, *Envy*, *Chagrin*,
*Drunkenness*, *Falsehood*, *Calumny*, and their horrible array.

The image of Ahriman was the Dragon, confounded by the

<span id="page_258">p. 258</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Jews with Satan
and the Serpent-Tempter. After a reign of 3000 years, Ormuzd had created
the Material World, in six periods, calling successively into existence
the Light, Water, Earth, plants, animals, and Man. But Ahriman concurred
in creating the earth and water; for darkness was already an element,
and Ormuzd could not exclude its Master. So also the two concurred in
producing Man. Ormuzd produced, by his Will and Word, a Being that was
the type and source of universal life for everything that exists under
Heaven. He placed in man a pure principle, or Life, proceeding from the
Supreme Being. But Ahriman destroyed that pure principle, in the form
wherewith it was clothed; and when Ormuzd had made, of its recovered and
purified essence, the first man and woman, Ahriman seduced and tempted
them with wine and fruits; the woman yielding first.

Often, during the three latter periods of 3000 years each, Ahriman and
Darkness are, and are to be, triumphant. But the pure souls are assisted
by the Good Spirits; the Triumph of Good is decreed by the Supreme
Being, and the period of that triumph will infallibly arrive. When the
world shall be most afflicted with the evils poured out upon it by the
spirits of perdition, three Prophets will come to bring relief to
mortals. SOSIOSCH, the principal of the Three, will regenerate the
earth, and restore to it its primitive beauty, strength, and purity. He
will judge the good and the wicked. After the universal resurrection of
the good, he will conduct them to a home of everlasting happiness.
Ahriman, his evil demons, and all wicked men, will also be purified in a
torrent of melted metal. The law of Ormuzd will reign everywhere; all
men will be happy; all, enjoying unalterable bliss, will sing with
Sosiosch the praises of the Supreme Being.

These doctrines, the details of which were sparingly borrowed by the
Pharisaic Jews, were much more fully adopted by the Gnostics; who taught
the restoration of all things, their return to their original pure
condition, the happiness of those to be saved, and their admission to
the feast of Heavenly Wisdom.

The doctrines of Zoroaster came originally from Bactria, an Indian
Province of Persia. Naturally, therefore, it would include Hindu or
Buddhist elements, as it did. The fundamental idea of Buddhism was,
matter subjugating the intelligence, and intelligence freeing itself
from that slavery. Perhaps something came to Gnosticism from China.
"Before the chaos which preceded

<span id="page_259">p. 259</span>

the birth of Heaven and Earth," says Lao-Tseu, "a single Being existed,
immense and silent, immovable and ever active--the mother of the
Universe. I know not its name: but I designate it by the word Reason.
Man has his type and model in the Earth; Earth in Heaven; Heaven in
Reason; and Reason in Itself." Here again are the Ferouers, the Ideas,
the Aions the REASON or INTELLIGENCE \[Εννοια\], SILENCE \[Σιγή\], WORD
\[Λογος\], and WISDOM \[Σοφια\] of the Gnostics.

The dominant system among the Jews after their captivity was that of the
Pharoschim or Pharisees. Whether their name was derived from that of the
Parsees, or followers of Zoroaster, or from some other source, it is
certain that they had borrowed much of their doctrine from the Persians.
Like them they claimed to have the exclusive and mysterious knowledge,
unknown to the mass. Like them they taught that a constant war was waged
between the Empire of Good and that of Evil. Like them they attributed
the sin and fall of man to the demons and their chief; and like them
they admitted a special protection of the righteous by inferior beings,
agents of Jehovah. All their doctrines on these subjects were at bottom
those of the Holy Books; but singularly developed; and the Orient was
evidently the source from which those developments came.

They styled themselves *Interpreters*; a name indicating their claim to
the exclusive possession of the true meaning of the Holy Writings, by
virtue of the oral tradition which Moses had received on Mount Sinai,
and which successive generations of Initiates had transmitted, as they
claimed, unaltered, unto them. Their very costume, their belief in the
influences of the stars, and in the immortality and transmigration of
souls, their system of angels and their astronomy, were all foreign.

Sadduceeism arose merely from an opposition essentially Jewish, to these
foreign teachings, and that mixture of doctrines, adopted by the
Pharisees, and which constituted the popular creed.

We come at last to the *Essenes* and *Therapeuts*, with whom this Degree
is particularly concerned. That intermingling of oriental and occidental
rites, of Persian and Pythagorean opinions, which we have pointed out in
the doctrines of Philo, is unmistakable in the creeds of these two
sects.

They were less distinguished by metaphysical speculations than by simple
meditations and moral practices. But the latter always

<span id="page_260">p. 260</span>

partook of the Zoroastrian principle, that it was necessary to free the
soul from the trammels and influences of matter; which led to a system
of abstinence and maceration entirely opposed to the ancient [Hebraic
ideas](errata.htm#5.md), favorable as they were to physical pleasures.

In general, the life and manners of these mystical associations, as
Philo and Josephus describe them, and particularly their prayers at
sunrise, seem the image of what the Zend-Avesta prescribes to the
faithful adorer or Ormuzd; and some of their observances cannot
otherwise be explained.

The Therapeuts resided in Egypt, in the neighborhood of Alexandria; and
the Essenes in Palestine, in the vicinity of the Dead Sea. But there was
nevertheless a striking coincidence in their ideas, readily explained by
attributing it to a foreign influence. The Jews of Egypt, under the
influence of the School of Alexandria, endeavored in general to make
their doctrines harmonize with the traditions of Greece; and thence
came, in the doctrines of the Therapeuts, as stated by Philo, the many
analogies between the Pythagorean and Orphic ideas, on one side, and
those of Judaism on the other: while the Jews of Palestine, having less
communication with Greece, or contemning its teachings, rather imbibed
the Oriental doctrines, which they drank in at the source and with which
their relations with Persia made them familiar. This attachment was
particularly shown in the Kabalah, which belonged rather to Palestine
than to Egypt, though extensively known in the latter; and furnished the
Gnostics with some of their most striking theories.

It is a significant fact, that while Christ spoke often of the Pharisees
and Sadducees, He never once mentioned the Essenes, between whose
doctrines and His there was so great a resemblance, and, in many points,
so perfect an identity. Indeed, they are not named, nor even distinctly
alluded to, anywhere in the New Testament.

John, the son of a Priest who ministered in the Temple at Jerusalem, and
whose mother was of the family of Aharun, was in the deserts until the
day of his showing unto Israel. He drank neither wine nor strong drink.
Clad in hair-cloth, and with a girdle of leather, and feeding upon such
food as the desert afforded, he preached, in the country about Jordan,
the baptism of repentance, for the remission of sins; that is, the
necessity of repentance proven by reformation. He taught the people
charity and

<span id="page_261">p. 261</span>

liberality; the publicans, justice, equity, and fair dealing; the
soldiery, peace, truth, and contentment; to do violence to none, accuse
none falsely, and be content with their pay. He inculcated the necessity
of a virtuous life, and the folly of trusting to their descent from
Abraham.

He denounced both Pharisees and Sadducees as a generation of vipers,
threatened with the anger of God. He baptized those who confessed their
sins. He preached in the desert; and therefore in the country where the
Essenes lived, professing the same doctrines. He was imprisoned before
Christ began to preach. Matthew mentions him without preface or
explanation; as if, apparently, his history was too well known to need
any. "In those days," he says, "came John the Baptist, preaching in the
wilderness of Judea." His disciples frequently fasted; for we find them
with the Pharisees coming to Jesus to inquire why *His* Disciples did
not fast as often as they; and He did not denounce *them*, as His habit
was to denounce the Pharisees; but answered them kindly and gently.

From his prison, John sent two of his disciples to inquire of Christ:
"Art thou he that is to come, or do we look for another?" Christ
referred them to his miracles as an answer; and declared to the people
that John was a prophet, and more than a prophet, and that no greater
man had ever been born; but that the humblest Christian was his
superior. He declared him to be Elias, who was to come.

John had denounced to Herod his marriage with his brother's wife as
unlawful; and for this he was imprisoned, and finally executed to
gratify her. His disciples buried him; and Herod and others thought he
had risen from the dead and appeared again in the person of Christ. The
people all regarded John as a prophet; and Christ silenced the Priests
and Elders by asking them whether he was inspired. They feared to excite
the anger of the people by saying that he was not. Christ declared that
he came "in the way of righteousness"; and that the lower classes
believed him, though the Priests and Pharisees did not.

Thus John, who was often consulted by Herod, and to whom that monarch
showed great deference, and was often governed by his advice; whose
doctrine prevailed very extensively among the people and the publicans,
taught *some* creed older than Christianity. That is plain: and it is
equally plain, that the very large

<span id="page_262">p. 262</span>

body of the Jews that adopted his doctrines, were neither Pharisees nor
Sadducees, but the humble, common people. They must, therefore, have
been Essenes. It is plain, too, that Christ applied for baptism as a
sacred rite, well known and long practiced. It was becoming to him, he
said, to fulfill all righteousness.

In the 18th chapter of the Acts of the Apostles we read thus: "And a
certain Jew, named Apollos, born at Alexandria, an eloquent man, and
mighty in the Scriptures, came to Ephesus. This man *was instructed in
the way of the Lord*, and, being fervent in spirit, *he spake and taught
diligently the things of the Lord, knowing only the baptism of John*;
and he began to speak boldly in the synagogue; whom, when Aquilla and
Priscilla had heard, they took him unto them, and expounded unto him
*the way of God* more perfectly."

Translating this from the symbolic and figurative language into the true
ordinary sense of the Greek text, it reads thus: "And a certain Jew,
named Apollos, an Alexandrian by birth, an eloquent man, and of
extensive learning, came to Ephesus. He had learned in the mysteries the
true doctrine in regard to God; and, being a zealous enthusiast, he
spoke and taught diligently the truths in regard to the Deity, having
received no other baptism than that of John." He knew nothing in regard
to Christianity; for he had resided in Alexandria, and had just then
come to Ephesus; being, probably, a disciple of Philo, and a Therapeut.

"That, in all times," says St. Augustine, "is the Christian religion,
which to know and follow is the most sure and certain health, called
according to that name, but not according to the thing itself, of which
it is the name; for the thing itself, which is now called the Christian
religion, *really was known to the Ancients*, nor was wanting at any
time from the beginning of the human race, until the time when Christ
came in the flesh; from whence the true religion, which had previously
existed, began to be called Christian; and this in our days is the
Christian religion, not as having been wanting in former times, but as
having, in later times, received this name." The disciples were first
called "Christians," at Antioch, when Barnabas and Paul began to preach
there.

The Wandering or Itinerant Jews or Exorcists, who assumed to employ the
Sacred Name in exorcising evil spirits, were no doubt Therapeutæ or
Essenes,

<span id="page_263">p. 263</span>

"And it came to pass," we read in the 19th chapter of the Acts, verses 1
to 4, "that while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul, having passed through
the upper parts of Asia Minor, came to Ephesus; and finding certain
*disciples*, he said to them, 'Have ye received the Holy Ghost since ye
became Believers?' And they said unto him, 'We have not so much as heard
that there *is* any Holy Ghost.' And he said to them, 'In what, then,
were you baptized?' And they said 'In John's baptism.' Then said Paul,
'John indeed baptized with the baptism of repentance, saying to the
people that they should believe in Him who was to come after him, that
is, in Jesus Christ. When they heard this, they were baptized in the
name of the Lord Jesus."

This faith, taught by John, and so nearly Christianity, could have been
nothing but the doctrine of the Essenes; and there can be no doubt that
John belonged to that sect. The place where he preached, his macerations
and frugal diet, the doctrines he taught, all prove it conclusively.
There was no other sect to which he *could* have belonged; certainly
none so numerous as his, *except* the Essenes.

We find, from the two letters written by Paul to the brethren at
Corinth, that City of Luxury and Corruption, that there were contentions
among them. Rival sects had already, about the 57th year of our era,
reared their banners there, as followers, some of Paul, some of Apollos,
and some of Cephas. Some of them denied the resurrection. Paul urged
them to adhere to the doctrines taught by himself, and had sent Timothy
to them to bring them afresh to their recollection.

According to Paul, Christ was to come again. He was to put an end to all
other Principalities and Powers, and finally to Death, and then be
Himself once more merged in God; *who should then be all in all*.

The forms and ceremonies of the Essenes were symbolical. They had,
according to Philo the Jew, four Degrees; the members being divided into
two Orders, the *Practici* and *Therapeutici*; the latter being the
contemplative and medical Brethren; and the former the active,
practical, business men. They were Jews by birth; and had a greater
affection for each other than the members of any other sect. Their
brotherly love was intense. They fulfilled the Christian law, "Love one
another." They despised riches. No one was to be found among them,
having more than

<span id="page_264">p. 264</span>

another. The possessions of one were intermingled with those of the
others; so that they all had but one patrimony, and were brethren. Their
piety toward God was extraordinary. Before sunrise they never spake a
word about profane matters; but put up certain prayers which they had
received from their forefathers. At dawn of day, and before it was
light, their prayers and hymns ascended to Heaven. They were eminently
faithful and true, and the Ministers of Peace. They had mysterious
ceremonies, and initiations into their mysteries; and the Candidate
promised that he would ever practise fidelity to all men, and especially
to those in authority, "because no one obtains the government without
God's assistance."

Whatever they said, was firmer than an oath; but they avoided swearing,
and esteemed it worse than perjury. They were simple in their diet and
mode of living, bore torture with fortitude, and despised death. They
cultivated the science of medicine and were very skillful. They deemed
it a good omen to dress in white robes. They had their own courts, and
passed righteous judgments. They kept the Sabbath more rigorously than
the Jews.

Their chief towns were Engaddi, near the Dead Sea, and Hebron. Engaddi
was about 30 miles southeast from Jerusalem, and Hebron about 20 miles
south of that city. Josephus and Eusebius speak of them as an ancient
sect; and they were no doubt the first among the Jews to embrace
Christianity: with whose faith and doctrine their own tenets had so many
points of resemblance, and were indeed in a great measure the same.
Pliny regarded them as a very ancient people.

In their devotions they turned toward the rising sun; as the Jews
generally did toward the Temple. But they were no idolaters; for they
observed the law of Moses with scrupulous fidelity. They held all things
in common, and despised riches, their wants being supplied by the
administration of Curators or Stewards. The Tetractys, composed of round
dots instead of jods, was revered among them. This being a Pythagorean
symbol, evidently shows their connection with the school of Pythagoras;
but their peculiar tenets more resemble those of Confucius and
Zoroaster; and probably were adopted while they were prisoners in
Persia; which explains their turning toward the Sun in prayer.

Their demeanor was sober and chaste. They submitted to the
superintendence of governors whom they appointed over themselves.

<span id="page_265">p. 265</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> The whole of their
time was spent in labor, meditation, and prayer; and they were most
sedulously attentive to every call of justice and humanity, and every
moral duty. They believed in the unity of God. They supposed the souls
of men to have fallen, by a disastrous fate, from the regions of purity
and light, into the bodies which they occupy; during their continuance
in which they considered them confined as in a prison. Therefore they
did not believe in the resurrection of the body; but in that of the soul
only. They believed in a future state of rewards and punishments; and
they disregarded the ceremonies or external forms enjoined in the law of
Moses to be observed in the worship of God; holding that the words of
that lawgiver were to be understood in a mysterious and recondite sense,
and not according to their literal meaning. They offered no sacrifices,
except at home; and by meditation they endeavored, as far as possible,
to isolate the soul from the body, and carry it back to God.

Eusebius broadly admits "that the ancient Therapeutæ were Christians;
and that their ancient writings were our Gospels and Epistles."

The ESSENES were of the Eclectic Sect of Philosophers, and held PLATO in
the highest esteem; they believed that true philosophy, the greatest and
most salutary gift of God to mortals, was scattered, in various
portions, through all the different Sects; and that it was,
consequently, the duty of every wise man to gather it from the several
quarters where it lay dispersed, and to employ it, thus reunited, in
destroying the dominion of impiety and vice.

The great festivals of the Solstices were observed in a distinguished
manner by the Essenes; as would naturally be supposed, from the fact
that they reverenced the Sun, not as a god, but as a symbol of light and
fire; the fountain of which, the Orientals supposed God to be. They
lived in continence and abstinence, and had establishments similar to
the monasteries of the early Christians.

The writings of the Essenes were full of mysticism, parables, enigmas,
and allegories. They believed in the esoteric and exoteric meanings of
the Scriptures; and, as we have already said, they had a warrant for
That in the Scriptures themselves. They found it in the Old Testament,
as the Gnostics found it in the New. The Christian writers, and even
Christ himself, recognized it as a

<span id="page_266">p. 266</span>

truth, that all Scripture had an inner and an outer meaning. Thus we
find it said as follows, in one of the Gospels:

"Unto you it is given to know the mystery of the Kingdom of God; but
unto men *that are without*, all these things are done in parables; that
seeing, they may see and not perceive, and hearing they may hear and not
understand. . . . And the disciples came and said unto him, 'Why
speakest Thou the truth in parables?'--He answered and said unto them,
'Because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the Kingdom of
Heaven, but to them it is not given.'"

Paul, in the 4th chapter of his Epistle to the Galatians, speaking of
the simplest facts of the Old Testament, asserts that they are *an
allegory*. In the 3d chapter of the second letter to the Corinthians, he
declares himself a minister of the New Testament, appointed by God; "Not
of the letter, but of the spirit; for the letter killeth." Origen and
St. Gregory held that the Gospels were not to be taken in their literal
sense; and Athanasius admonishes us that "Should we understand sacred
writ according to the letter, we should fall into the most enormous
blasphemies."

Eusebius said, "Those who preside over the Holy Scriptures, philosophize
over them, and expound their literal sense by allegory."

The sources of our knowledge of the Kabalistic doctrines, are the books
of Jezirah and Sohar, the former drawn up in the second century, and the
latter a little later; but containing materials much older than
themselves. In their most characteristic elements, they go back to the
time of the exile. In them, as in the teachings of Zoroaster, everything
that exists emanated from a source of infinite LIGHT. Before everything,
existed THE ANCIENT OF DAYS, the KING OF LIGHT; a title often given to
the Creator in the *Zend-Avesta* and the code of the *Sabæans*. With the
idea so expressed is connected the pantheism of India. THE KING OR
LIGHT, THE ANCIENT, is ALL THAT IS. He is not only the real cause of all
Existences; he is Infinite \[AINSOPH\]. He is HIMSELF: there is nothing
in Him that We can call *Thou*.

In the Indian doctrine, not only is the Supreme Being the real cause of
all, but he is the only real Existence: all the rest is illusion. In the
Kabalah, as in the Persian and Gnostic doctrines, He is the Supreme
Being unknown to all, the "Unknown Father." The world is his revelation,
and subsists only in Him. His attributes

<span id="page_267">p. 267</span>

are reproduced there, with different modifications, and in different
degrees, so that the Universe is His Holy Splendor: it is but His
Mantle; but it must be revered in silence. All beings have emanated from
the Supreme Being: The nearer a being is to Him, the more perfect it is;
the more remote in the scale, the less its purity.

A ray of Light, shot from the Deity, is the cause and principle of all
that exists. It is at once Father and Mother of All, in the sublimest
sense. It penetrates everything; and without it nothing can exist an
instant. From this double FORCE, designated by the two parts of the word
I∴H∴U∴H∴ emanated the FIRST-BORN of God, the Universal FORM, in which
are contained all beings; the Persian and Platonic Archetype of things,
united with the Infinite by the primitive ray of Light.

This First-Born is the Creative Agent, Conservator, and animating
Principle of the Universe. It is THE LIGHT of LIGHT. It possesses the
three Primitive Forces of the Divinity, LIGHT, SPIRIT, and LIFE \[Φώς,
Πνευμά, and Ζων\]. As it has received what it gives, Light and Life, it
is equally considered as the generative and conceptive Principle, the
Primitive Man, ADAM KADMON. As such, it has revealed itself in ten
emanations or *Sephiroth*, which are not ten different beings, nor even
beings at all; but sources of life, vessels of Omnipotence, and types of
Creation. They are *Sovereignty* or *Will*, *Wisdom*, *Intelligence*,
*Benignity*, *Severity*, *Beauty*, *Victory*, *Glory*, *Permanency*, and
*Empire*. These are attributes of God; and this idea, that God reveals
Himself by His attributes, and that the human mind cannot perceive or
discern God Himself, in his works, but only his mode of manifesting
Himself, is a profound Truth. We know of the Invisible only what the
Visible reveals.

*Wisdom* was called NOUS and LOGOS \[and Νοῦς Λογος\], INTELLECT or the
WORD. *Intelligence*, source of the oil of anointing, responds to the
Holy Ghost of the Christian Faith.

*Beauty* is represented by green and yellow. *Victory* is
YAHOVAH-TSABAOTH, the column on the right hand, the column *Jachin*:
*Glory* is the column *Boaz*, on the left hand. And thus our symbols
appear again in the Kabalah. And again the LIGHT, the object of our
labors, appears as the creative power of Deity. The circle, also, was
the special symbol of the first Sephirah, Kether, or the Crown,

<span id="page_268">p. 268</span>

We do not further follow the Kabalah in its four Worlds of Spirits,
*Aziluth*, *Briah*, *Yezirah*, and *Asiah*, or of *emanation*,
*creation*, *formation*, and *fabrication*, one inferior to and one
emerging from the other, the superior always enveloping the inferior;
its doctrine that, in all that exists, there is nothing purely material;
that all comes from God, and in all He proceeds by irradiation; that
everything subsists by the Divine ray that penetrates creation; and all
is united by the Spirit of God, which is the life of life; so that all
is God; the Existences that inhabit the four worlds, inferior to each
other in proportion to their distance from the Great King of Light: the
contest between the good and evil Angels and Principles, to endure until
the Eternal Himself cones to end it and re-establish the primitive
harmony; the four distinct parts of the Soul of Man; and the migrations
of impure souls, until they are sufficiently purified to share with the
Spirits of Light the contemplation of the Supreme Being whose Splendor
fills the Universe.

The WORD was also found in the Phœnician Creed. As in all those of Asia,
a WORD of God, written in starry characters, by the planetary
Divinities, and communicated by the Demi-Gods, as a profound mystery, to
the higher classes of the human race, to be communicated by them to
mankind, created the world. The faith of the Phœnicians was an emanation
from that ancient worship of the Stars, which in the creed of Zoroaster
alone, is connected with a faith in one God. Light and Fire are the most
important agents in the Phœnician faith. There is a race of children of
the Light. They adored the Heaven with its Lights, deeming it the
Supreme God.

Everything emanates from a Single Principle, and a Primitive Love, which
is the Moving Power of All and governs all. Light, by its union with
Spirit, whereof it is but the vehicle or symbol, is the Life of
everything, and penetrates everything. It should therefore be respected
and honored everywhere; for everywhere it governs and controls.

The Chaldaic and Jerusalem Paraphrasts endeavored to render the phrase,
DEBAR-YAHOVAH \[‏ו ?D?B?R ?Y?H?W?H‎\], the Word of God, a
[personality](errata.htm#6.md), wherever they met with it. The phrase, "And
God created man," is, in the Jerusalem Targum, "And the Word of IHUH
created man."

So, in xxviii. Gen. 20, 21, where Jacob says: "If God \[‏ו ?Y?H?Y?H
?A?L?H?Yמ‎ 

<span id="page_269">p. 269</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> IHIH ALHIM\] will
be with me . . . then shall IHUH be my ALHIM \[‏ו ?W?H?Y?H ?Y?H?W?H ?L?Y
?L?A?L?H?Yמ‎, UHIH IHUH LI LALHIM\]; and this stone shall be God's House
\[‏ו ?Y?H?Y?H ?B?Y?Tה ?A?L?H?Yמ‎, IHUH BITH ALHIM\]: Onkelos paraphrases
it, "If the word of IHUH will be my help . . . . then the word of IHUH
shall be my God."

So, in iii. Gen. 8, for "The Voice of the Lord God" \[‏ו ?Y?H?W?H
?A?L?H?Yמ‎ IHUH ALHIM\], we have, "The Voice of the Word of IHUH."

In ix. Wisdom, 1, "O God of my Fathers and Lord of Mercy! who has made
all things with thy word. ἐν λόγου σου."

And in xviii. Wisdom, 15, "Thine Almighty Word \[Λογος\] leaped down
from Heaven."

Philo speaks of the Word as being the same with God. So in several
places he calls it "δεύτερος Θεἰος Λόγος" the Second Divinity; "εἰκὼν
του Θεοῦ," the Image of God: the Divine Word that made all things: "the
ὕπαρχος" substitute, of God; and the like.

Thus, when John commenced to preach, had been for ages agitated, by the
Priests and Philosophers of the East and West, the great questions
concerning the eternity or creation of matter: immediate or intermediate
creation of the Universe by the Supreme God; the origin, object, and
final extinction of evil; the relations between the intellectual and
material worlds, and between God and man; and the creation, fall,
redemption, and restoration to his first estate, of man.

The Jewish doctrine, differing in this from all the other Oriental
creeds, and even from the Alohay\_istic legend with which the book of
Genesis commences, attributed the creation to the immediate action of
the Supreme Being. The Theosophists of the other Eastern Peoples
interposed more than one intermediary between God and the world. To
place between them but a single Being, to suppose for the production of
the world but a single intermediary, was, in their eyes, to lower the
Supreme Majesty. The interval between God, who is perfect Purity, and
matter, which is base and foul, was too great for them to clear it at a
single step. Even in the Occident, neither Plato nor Philo could thus
impoverish the Intellectual World.

Thus, Cerinthus of Ephesus, with most of the Gnostics, Philo, the
Kabalah, the Zend-Avesta, the Puranas, and all the Orient, deemed the
distance and antipathy between the Supreme Being and the material world
too great, to attribute to the former the creation of the latter. Below,
and emanating from, or created

<span id="page_270">p. 270</span>

by, the Ancient of Days, the Central Light, the Beginning, or First
Principle \[Αρχὴ\], one, two, or more Principles, Existences, or
Intellectual Beings were imagined, to some one or more of whom \[without
any immediate creative act on the part of the Great Immovable, Silent
Deity\], the immediate creation of the material and mental universe was
due.

We have already spoken of many of the speculations on this point. To
some, the world was created by the LOGOS or WORD, first manifestation
of, or emanation from, the Deity. To others, the beginning of creation
was by the emanation of a ray of LIGHT, creating the principle of
*Light* and *Life*. The Primitive THOUGHT, creating the inferior
Deities, a succession of INTELLIGENCES, the Iynges of Zoroaster, his
*Amshaspands*, *Izeds*, and *Ferouers*, the *Ideas* of Plato, the
*Aions* of the Gnostics, the *Angels* of the Jews, the *Nous*, the
*Demiourgos*, the DIVINE REASON, the *Powers* or *Forces* of Philo, and
the Alohayim, Forces or Superior Gods of the ancient legend with which
Genesis begins; to these and other intermediaries the creation was
owing. No restraints were laid on the Fancy and the Imagination. The
veriest Abstractions became Existences and Realities. The attributes of
God, personified, became Powers, Spirits, Intelligences.

God was the *Light of Light*, *Divine Fire*, the *Abstract
Intellectuality*, the *Root* or *Germ* of the Universe. *Simon Magus*,
founder of the Gnostic faith, and many of the early Judaizing
Christians, admitted that the manifestations of the Supreme Being, as
FATHER, or JEHOVAH, SON or CHRIST, and HOLY SPIRIT, were only so many
different *modes* of Existence, or *Forces* \[δυναμεις\] of the same
God. To others they were, as were the multitude of Subordinate
Intelligences, real and distinct beings.

The Oriental imagination revelled in the creation of these Inferior
Intelligences, Powers of Good and Evil, and Angels. We have spoken of
those imagined by the Persians and the Kabalists. In the Talmud, every
star, every country, every town, and almost every tongue has a Prince of
Heaven as its Protector. JEHUEL is the guardian of fire, and MICHAEL, of
water. Seven spirits assist each; those of fire being *Seraphiel*,
*Gabriel*, *Nitriel*, *Tammael*, *Tchimschiel*, *Hadarniel*, and
*Sarniel*. These seven are represented by the square columns of this
Degree, while the columns JACHIN and BOAZ represent the angels of fire
and water. But the columns are not representatives of these alone.

<span id="page_271">p. 271</span>

To Basilides, God was without name, uncreated, at first containing and
concealing in Himself the Plenitude of His Perfections; and when these
are by Him displayed and manifested, there result as many particular
Existences, all analogous to Him, and still and always Him. To the
Essenes and the Gnostics, the East and the West both devised this faith;
that the Ideas, Conceptions, or Manifestations of the Deity were so many
Creations, so many Beings, all God, nothing without Him, but more than
what we now understand by the word *ideas*. They emanated from and were
again merged in God. They had a kind of middle existence between our
modern ideas, and the intelligences or ideas, elevated to the rank of
genii, of the Oriental mythology.

These personified attributes of Deity, in the theory of Basilides, were
the Πρωτόγονος or *First-born*, Νοῦς \[*Nous* or *Mind*\]: from it
emanates Λογος \[*Logos*, or THE WORD\] from it Φρόνησις: \[*Phronesis*,
*Intellect*\]: from it Σοφια \[*Sophia*, *Wisdom*\]: from it Δύναμις
\[*Dunamis*, *Power*\]: and from it Δικαιοσύνη \[*Dikaiosune*,
*Righteousness*\]: to which latter the Jews gave the name of Ειρηνη
\[*Eirene*, *Peace*, or *Calm*\], the essential characteristics of
Divinity, and harmonious effect of all His perfections. The whole number
of successive emanations was 365, expressed by the Gnostics, in Greek
letters, by the mystic word ΑΒΡΑΞΑΣ \[*Abraxas*\]; designating God as
manifested, or the aggregate of his manifestations; but not the Supreme
and Secret God Himself. These three hundred and sixty-five Intelligences
compose altogether the Fullness or *Plenitude* \[Πληρωμα\] of the Divine
Emanations.

With the Ophites, a sect of the Gnostics, there were seven inferior
spirits \[inferior to Ialdabaoth, the Demiourgos or Actual Creator\]:
*Michaël*, *Surièl*, *Raphaël*, *Gabriel*, *Thauthabaoth*, *Erataoth*,
and *Athaniel*, the genii of the stars called the Bull, the Dog, the
Lion, the Bear, the Serpent, the Eagle, and the Ass that formerly
figured in the constellation Cancer, and symbolized respectively by
those animals; as *Ialdabaoth*, *Iao*, *Adonaï*, *Eloï*, *Oraï*, and
*Astaphaï* were the genii of Saturn, the Moon, the Sun, Jupiter, Venus,
and Mercury.

The WORD appears in all these creeds. It is the *Ormuzd* of Zoroaster,
the *Ainsoph* of the Kabalah, the *Nous* of Platonism and Philonism, and
the *Sophia* or *Demiourgos* of the Gnostics.

And all these creeds, while admitting these different manifestations of
the Supreme Being, held that His identity was immutable

<span id="page_272">p. 272</span>

and permanent. That was Plato's distinction between the Being always the
same \[τὸ ὄν\] and the perpetual flow of things incessantly changing,
the Genesis.

The belief in dualism in some shape, was universal. Those who held that
everything emanated from God, aspired to God, and re-entered into God,
believed that, among those emanations were two adverse Principles, of
Light and Darkness, Good and Evil. This prevailed in Central Asia and in
Syria; while in Egypt it assumed the form of Greek speculation. In the
former, a second Intellectual Principle was admitted, active in its
Empire of Darkness, audacious against the Empire of Light. So the
Persians and Sabeans understood it. In Egypt, this second Principle was
Matter, as the word was used by the Platonic School, with its sad
attributes, Vacuity, Darkness, and Death. In their theory, matter could
be animated only by the low communication of a principle of divine life.
It resists the influences that would spiritualize it. That resisting
Power is Satan, the rebellious Matter, Matter that does not partake of
God.

To many there were two Principles; the Unknown Father, or Supreme and
Eternal God, living in the centre of the Light, happy in the perfect
purity of His being; the other, eternal Matter, that inert, shapeless,
darksome mass, which they considered as the source of all evils, the
mother and dwelling-place of Satan.

To Philo and the Platonists, there was a Soul of the world, creating
visible things, and active in them, as agent of the Supreme
Intelligence; realizing therein the ideas communicated to Him by that
Intelligence, and which sometimes excel His conceptions, but which He
executes without comprehending them.

The Apocalypse or Revelations, by whomever written, belongs to the
Orient and to extreme antiquity. It reproduces what is far older than
itself. It paints, with the strongest colors that the Oriental genius
ever employed, the closing scenes of the great struggle of Light, and
Truth, and Good, against Darkness, Error, and Evil; personified in that
between the New Religion on one side, and Paganism and Judaism on the
other. It is a particular application of the ancient myth of Ormuzd and
his Genii against Ahriman and his Devs; and it celebrates the final
triumph of Truth against the combined powers of men and demons. The
ideas and imagery are borrowed from every quarter; and allusions are
found in it to the doctrines of all ages. We are continually reminded

<span id="page_273">p. 273</span>

of the Zend-Avesta, the Jewish Codes, Philo, and the Gnosis. The Seven
Spirits surrounding the Throne of the Eternal, at the opening of the
Grand Drama, and acting so important a part throughout, everywhere the
first instruments of the Divine Will and Vengeance, are the Seven
Amshaspands of Parsism; as the Twenty-four Ancients, offering to the
Supreme Being the first supplications and the first homage, remind us of
the Mysterious Chiefs of Judaism, foreshadow the Eons of Gnosticism, and
re-produce the twenty-four Good Spirits created by Ormuzd and inclosed
in an egg.

The Christ of the Apocalypse, First-born of Creation and of the
Resurrection, is invested with the characteristics of the Ormuzd and
Sosiosch of the Zend-Avesta, the Ainsoph of the Kabalah and the
Carpistes \[Καρπιότης\] of the Gnostics. The idea that the true
Initiates and Faithful become Kings and Priests, is at once Persian,
Jewish, Christian, and Gnostic. And the definition of the Supreme Being,
that He is at once Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end--He that
was, and is, and is to come, *i.e.*, Time illimitable, is Zoroaster's
definition of Zerouane-Akherene.

The depths of Satan which no man can measure; his triumph for a time by
fraud and violence; his being chained by an angel; his reprobation and
his precipitation into a sea of metal; his names of the Serpent and the
Dragon; the whole conflict of the Good Spirits or celestial armies
against the bad; are so many ideas and designations found alike in the
Zend-Avesta, the Kabalah, and the Gnosis.

We even find in the Apocalypse that singular Persian idea, which regards
some of the lower animals as so many Devs or vehicles of Devs.

The guardianship of the earth by a good angel, the renewing of the earth
and heavens, and the final triumph of pure and holy men, are the same
victory of Good over Evil, for which the whole Orient looked.

The gold, and white raiments of the twenty-four Elders are, as in the
Persian faith, the signs of a lofty perfection and divine purity.

Thus the Human mind labored and struggled and tortured itself for ages,
to explain to itself what it felt, without confessing it, to be
inexplicable. A vast crowd of indistinct abstractions, hovering

<span id="page_274">p. 274</span>

in the imagination, a train of words embodying no tangible meaning, an
inextricable labyrinth of subtleties, was the result.

But one grand idea ever emerged and stood prominent and unchangeable
over the weltering chaos of confusion. God is great, and good, and wise.
Evil and pain and sorrow are temporary, and for wise and beneficent
purposes. They *must* be consistent with God's goodness, purity, and
infinite perfection; and there *must* be a mode of explaining them, if
we could but find it out; as, in all ways we will endeavor to do.
Ultimately, Good will prevail, and Evil be overthrown. God alone *can*
do this, and He *will* do it, by an Emanation from Himself, assuming the
Human form and redeeming the world.

Behold the object, the end, the result, of the great speculations and
logomachies of antiquity; the ultimate annihilation of evil, and
restoration of Man to his first estate, by a Redeemer, a Masayah, a
Christos, the incarnate Word, Reason, or Power of Deity.

This Redeemer is the Word or Logos, the Ormuzd of Zoroaster, the Ainsoph
of the Kabalah, the Nous of Platonism and Philonism; He that was in the
Beginning with God, and was God, and by Whom everything was made. That
He was looked for by all the People of the East is abundantly shown by
the Gospel of John and the Letters of Paul; wherein scarcely anything
seemed necessary to be said in proof that such a Redeemer was to come;
but all the energies of the writers are devoted to showing that Jesus
was that Christos whom all the nations were expecting; the "Word," the
Masayah, the Anointed or Consecrated One.

In this Degree the great contest between good and evil, in anticipation
of the appearance and advent of the Word or Redeemer is symbolized; and
the mysterious esoteric teachings of the Essenes and the Cabalists. Of
the practices of the former we gain but glimpses in the ancient writers;
but we know that, as their doctrines were taught by John the Baptist,
they greatly resembled those of greater purity and more nearly perfect,
taught by Jesus; and that not only Palestine was full of John's
disciples, so that the Priests and Pharisees did not dare to deny John's
inspiration; but his doctrine had extended to Asia Minor, and had made
converts in luxurious Ephesus, as it also had in Alexandria in Egypt;
and that they readily embraced the Christian faith, of which they had
before not even heard.

These old controversies have died away, and the old faiths have

<span id="page_275">p. 275</span>

faded into oblivion. But Masonry still survives, vigorous and strong, as
when philosophy was taught in the schools of Alexandria and under the
Portico; teaching the same old truths as the Essenes taught by the
shores of the Dead Sea, and as John the Baptist preached in the Desert;.
truths imperishable as the Deity, and undeniable as Light. Those truths
were gathered by the Essenes from the doctrines of the Orient and the
Occident, from the Zend-Avesta and the Vedas, from Plato and Pythagoras,
from India, Persia, Phœnicia, and Syria, from Greece and Egypt, and from
the Holy Books of the Jews. Hence we are called Knights of the East and
West, because their doctrines came from both. And these doctrines, the
wheat sifted from the chaff, the Truth separated from Error, Masonry has
garnered up in her heart of hearts, and through the fires of
persecution, and the storms of calamity, has brought them and delivered
them unto us. That God is One, immutable, unchangeable, infinitely just
and good; that Light will finally overcome Darkness,--Good conquer Evil,
and Truth be victor over Error;--these, rejecting all the wild and
useless speculations of the Zend-Avesta, the Kabalah, the Gnostics, and
the Schools, are the religion and Philosophy of Masonry.

Those speculations and fancies it is useful to study; that knowing in
what worthless and unfruitful investigations the mind may engage, you
may the more value and appreciate the plain, simple, sublime,
universally-acknowledged truths, which have in all ages been the Light
by which Masons have been guided on their way; the Wisdom and Strength
that like imperishable columns have sustained and will continue to
sustain its glorious and magnificent Temple.
