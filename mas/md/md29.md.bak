### XXVIII.

### KNIGHT OF THE SUN, OR PRINCE ADEPT.

GOD is the author of everything that existeth; the Eternal, the Supreme,
the Living, and Awful Being; from Whom nothing in the Universe is
hidden. Make of Him no idols and visible images; but rather worship Him
in the deep solitudes of sequestered forests; for He is invisible, and
fills the Universe as its soul, and liveth not in any Temple!

Light and Darkness are the World's Eternal ways. God is the principle of
everything that exists, and the Father of all Beings. He is eternal,
immovable, and Self-Existent. There are no bounds to His power. At one
glance He sees the Past, the Present, and the Future; and the procession
of the builders of the Pyramids, with us and our remotest Descendants,
is now passing before Him. He reads our thoughts before they are known
to ourselves. He rules the movements of the Universe, and all events and
revolutions are the creatures of His will. For He is the Infinite Mind
and Supreme Intelligence.

In the beginning Man had the WORD, and that WORD was from God: and out
of the living power which, in and by that WORD, was communicated to man,
came the LIGHT of his existence. Let no man speak the WORD, for by it
THE FATHER made light and darkness, the world and living creatures!

<span id="page_582">p. 582</span>

The Chaldean upon his plains worshipped me, and the sea-loving
Phœnician. They builded me temples and towers, and burned sacrifices to
me upon a thousand altars. Light was divine to them, and they thought me
a God. But I am nothing--*nothing*; and LIGHT is the creature of the
unseen GOD that taught the true religion to the Ancient Patriarchs:
AWFUL, MYSTERIOUS, THE ABSOLUTE.

Man was created pure; and God gave him TRUTH, as He gave him LIGHT. He
has lost the *truth* and found *error*. He has wandered far into
darkness; and round him Sin and Shame hover evermore. The Soul that is
impure, and sinful, and defiled with earthly stains, cannot again unite
with God, until, by long trials and many purifications, it is finally
delivered from the old calamity; and Light overcomes Darkness and
dethrones it, in the Soul.

God is the First; indestructible, eternal, UNCREATED, INDIVISIBLE.
*Wisdom*, *Justice*, *Truth*, and *Mercy*, with *Harmony* and *Love*,
are of His essence, and *Eternity* and *Infinitude of Extension*. He is
silent, and consents with MIND, and is known to Souls through MIND
alone. In Him were all things originally contained, and from Him all
things were evolved. For out of His Divine SILENCE and REST, after an
infinitude of time, was unfolded the WORD, or the Divine POWER; and then
in turn the Mighty, ever-acting, measureless INTELLECT; and from the
WORD were evolved the myriads of suns and systems that make the
Universe; and *fire*, and *light*, and the electric HARMONY, which is
the harmony of spheres and numbers: and from the INTELLECT all Souls and
intellects of men.

In the Beginning, the Universe was but ONE SOUL. HE was THE ALL, alone
with TIME and SPACE, and Infinite as they.

------ HE HAD THIS THOUGHT: "*I Create Worlds*:" and lo! *the Universe*,
and the laws of *harmony* and *motion* that rule it. the expression of a
thought of God; and bird and beast, and every living thing but Man: and
light and air, and the mysterious cur-rents, and the dominion of
mysterious numbers!

------ HE HAD THIS THOUGHT: "*I Create Man, whose Soul shall be my
image, and he shall rule*." And lo! Man, with senses, instinct, and a
reasoning mind!

------ And yet not MAN! but an *animal* that breathed, and saw, and
thought: until an immaterial spark from God's own

<span id="page_583">p. 583</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Infinite Being
penetrated the brain, and became the Soul: and lo, MAN THE IMMORTAL!
Thus, threefold, fruit of God's thought, is Man; that sees and hears and
feels; that thinks and reasons; that loves and is in harmony with the
Universe.

Before the world grew old, the primitive Truth faded out from men's
Souls. Then man asked himself, "*What am I? and how and whence am I? and
whither do I go?*" And the Soul, looking inward upon itself, strove to
learn whether that "I" were mere matter; its thought and reason and its
passions and affections mere results of material combination; or a
material Being enveloping an immaterial Spirit: . . and further it
strove, by self-examination, to learn whether that Spirit were an
individual essence, with a separate immortal existence, or an
infinitesimal portion of a Great First Principle, inter-penetrating the
Universe and the infinitude of space, and undulating like light and
heat: . . and so they wandered further amid the mazes of error; and
imagined vain philosophies; wallowing in the sloughs of materialism and
sensualism, of beating their wings vainly in the vacuum of abstractions
and idealities.

While yet the first oaks still put forth their leaves, man lost the
perfect knowledge of the One True God, the Ancient Absolute Existence,
the Infinite Mind and Supreme Intelligence; and floated helplessly out
upon the shoreless ocean of conjecture. Then the soul vexed itself with
seeking to learn whether the material Universe was a mere chance
combination of atoms, or the work of Infinite, Uncreated Wisdom: . .
whether the Deity was a concentrated, and the Universe an extended
immateriality; or whether He was a personal existence, an Omnipotent,
Eternal, Supreme Essence, regulating matter at will; or subjecting it to
unchangeable laws throughout eternity; and to Whom, Himself Infinite and
Eternal, Space and Time are unknown. With their finite limited vision
they sought to learn the source and explain the existence of Evil, and
Pain, and Sorrow; and so they wandered ever deeper into the darkness,
and were lost; and there was for them no longer any God; but only a
great, dumb, soulless Universe, full of mere emblems and symbols.

You have heretofore, in some of the Degrees through which you have
passed, heard much of the ancient worship of the Sun, the Moon, and the
other bright luminaries of Heaven, and of the Elements and Powers of
Universal Nature. You have been made, to

<span id="page_584">p. 584</span>

some extent, familiar with their personifications as Heroes suffering or
triumphant, or as personal Gods or Goddesses, with human characteristics
and passions, and with the multitude of legends and fables that do but
allegorically represent their risings and settings, their courses, their
conjunctions and oppositions, their domiciles and places of exaltation.

Perhaps you have supposed that we, like many who have written on these
subjects, have intended to represent this worship to you as the most
ancient and original worship of the first men that lived. To undeceive
you, if such was your conclusion, we have caused the Personifications of
the Great Luminary of Heaven, under the names by which he was known to
the most ancient nations, to proclaim the old primitive truths that were
known to the Fathers of our race, before men came to worship the visible
manifestations of the Supreme Power and Magnificence and the Supposed
Attributes of the Universal Deity in the Elements and in the glittering
armies that Night regularly marshals and arrays upon the blue field of
the firmament.

We ask now your attention to a still further development of these
truths, after we shall have added something to what we have already said
in regard to the Chief Luminary of Heaven, in explanation of the names
and characteristics of the several imaginary Deities that represented
him among the ancient races of men.

ATHOM or ATHOM-RE, was the Chief and Oldest Supreme God of Upper Egypt,
worshipped at Thebes; the same as the OM or AUM of the Hindu\_s, whose
name was unpronounceable, and who, like the BREHM of the latter People,
was "The Being that was, and is, and is to come; the Great God, the
Great Omnipotent, Omniscient, and Omnipresent One, the Greatest in the
Universe, the Lord;" whose emblem was a perfect sphere, showing that He
was first, last, midst, and without end; superior to all Nature-Gods,
and all personifications of Powers, Elements, and Luminaries; symbolized
by Light, the Principle of Life.

AMUN was the Nature-God, or Spirit of Nature, called by that name or
AMUN-RE, and worshipped at Memphis in Lower Egypt, and in Libya, as well
as in Upper Egypt. He was the Libyan Jupiter, and represented the
intelligent and organizing force that develops itself in Nature, when
the intellectual types or forms of bodies are revealed to the senses in
the world's order, by their

<span id="page_585">p. 585</span>

union with matter, whereby the generation of bodies is effected. He was
the same with Kneph, from whose mouth issued the Orphic egg out of which
came the Universe.

DIONUSOS was the Nature-God of the Greeks, as AMUN was of the Egyptians.
In the popular legend, Dionusos, as well as Hercules, was a Theban Hero,
born of a mortal mother. Both were sons of Zeus, both persecuted by
Here. But in Hercules the God is subordinate to the Hero; while
Dionusos, even in poetry, retains his divine character, and is identical
with Iacchus, the presiding genius of the Mysteries. Personification of
the Sun in Taurus, as his ox-hoofs showed, the delivered earth from the
harsh dominion of Winter, conducted the mighty chorus of the Stars, and
the celestial revolution of the year, changed with the seasons, and
underwent their periodical decay. He was the Sun as invoked by the
Eleans, Πυριγενης, ushered into the world amidst lightning and thunder,
the Mighty Hunter of the Zodiac, Zagreus the Golden or ruddy-faced. The
Mysteries taught the doctrine of Divine Unity; and that Power Whose
Oneness is a seeming mystery, but really a truism, was Dionusos, the God
of Nature, or of that moisture, which is the life of Nature, who
prepares in darkness, in Hades or Iasion, the return of life and
vegetation, or is himself the light and change evolving their varieties.
In the Egean Islands he was Butes, Dardanus, Himeros or Imbros; in Crete
he appears as Iasius or even Zeus, whose orgiastic worship, remaining
unveiled by the usual forms of mystery, betrayed to profane curiosity
the symbols which, if irreverently contemplated, were sure to be
misunderstood.

He was the same with the dismembered Zagreus, the son of Persephoné, an
Ancient Subterranean Dionusos, the horned progeny of Zeus in the
Constellation of the Serpent, entrusted by his father with the
thunderbolt, and encircled with the protecting dance of Curetes. Through
the envious artifices of Here, the Titans eluded the vigilance of his
guardians and tore him to pieces; but Pallas restored the still
palpitating heart to his father, who commanded Apollo to bury the
dismembered remains upon Parnassus.

Dionusos, as well as Apollo, was leader of the Muses; the tomb of one
accompanied the worship of the other; they were the same, yet different,
contrasted, yet only as filling separate parts in the same drama; and
the mystic and heroic personifications, the God of Nature and of Art,
seem, at some remote period, to have proceeded from a common source.
Their separation was one of form

<span id="page_586">p. 586</span>

rather than of substance: and from the time when Hercules obtained
initiation from Triptolemus, or Pythagoras received Orphic tenets, the
two conceptions were tending to re-combine. It was said that Dionusos or
Poseidon had preceded Apollo in the Oracular office; and Dionusos
continued to be esteemed in Greek Theology as Healer and Saviour, Author
of Life and Immortality. The dispersed Pythagoreans, "Sons of Apollo,"
immediately betook themselves to the Orphic Service of Dionusos, and
there are indications that there was always something Dionysiac in the
worship of Apollo.

Dionusos is the Sun, that liberator of the elements; and his spiritual
meditation was suggested by the same imagery which made the Zodiac the
supposed path of the Spirits in their descent and their return. His
second birth, as offspring of the highest, is a type of the spiritual
regeneration of man. He, as well as Apollo, was
[preceptor](errata.htm#26.md) of the Muses and source of inspiration. His
rule prescribed no unnatural mortification: its yoke was easy, and its
mirthful choruses, combining the gay with the severe, did but
commemorate that golden age when earth enjoyed eternal spring, and when
fountains of honey, milk, and wine burst forth out of its bosom at the
touch of the thyrsus. He is the "Liberator." Like Osiris, he frees the
soul, and guides it in its migrations beyond the grave, preserving it
from the risk of again falling under the slavery of matter or of some
inferior animal form. All soul is part of the Universal Soul, whose
totality is Dionusos; and he leads back the vagrant spirit to its home,
and accompanies it through the purifying processes, both real and
symbolical, of its earthly transit. He died and descended to the Shades;
and his suffering was the great secret of the Mysteries, as death is the
grand mystery of existence. He is the immortal suitor of Psyche (the
Soul), the Divine influence which physically called the world into
being, and which, awakening the soul from its Stygian trance, restores
it from earth to Heaven.

Of HERMES, the Mercury of the Greeks, the Thoth of the Egyptians, and
the Taaut of the Phœnicians, we have heretofore spoken sufficiently at
length. He was the inventor of letters and of Oratory, the winged
messenger of the Gods, bearing the Caduceus wreathed with serpents; and
in our Council he is represented by the ORATOR.

The *Hindu\_s* called the Sun SURYA; the *Persians*, MITHRAS;

<span id="page_587">p. 587</span>

the *Egyptians*, OSIRIS; the *Assyrians* and *Chaldæans*, BEL; the
*Scythians* and *Etruscans* and the ancient *Pelasgi*, ARKALEUS or
HERCULES; the *Phœnicians*, ADONAI or ADON; and the *Scandinavians*,
ODIN.

From the name SURYA, given by the Hindu\_s to the Sun, the Sect who paid
him particular adoration were called *Souras*. Their painters describe
his car as drawn by seven green horses. In the Temple of Visweswara, at
Benares, there is an ancient piece of sculpture, well executed in stone,
representing him sitting in a car drawn by a horse with twelve heads.
His charioteer, by whom he is preceded, is ARUN \[from ‏ו ?A?W?R‎, AUR
the *Crepusculum*?\], or the Dawn; and among his many titles are twelve
that denote his distinct powers in each of the twelve months. Those
powers are called Adityas, each of whom has a particular name. Surya is
supposed frequently to have descended upon earth, in a human shape, and
to have left a race on earth, equally renowned in Indian story with the
Heliades of Greece. He is often styled King of the Stars and Planets,
and thus reminds us of the Adon-Tsbauth (Lord of the Starry Hosts) of
the Hebrew writings.

MITHRAS was the Sun-God of the Persians; and was fabled to have been
born in a grotto or cave, at the Winter Solstice. His feasts were
celebrated at that period, at the moment when the sun commenced to
return Northward, and to increase the length of the days. This was the
great Feast of the Magian religion. The Roman Calendar, published in the
time of Constantine, at which period his worship began to gain ground in
the Occident, fixed his feast-day on the 25th of December. His statues
and images were inscribed, *Deo-Soli invicto Mithræ*--to the invincible
Sun-God Mithras. *Nomen invictum Sol Mithra. . . . Soli Omnipotenti
Mithræ*. To him, gold, incense, and myrrh were consecrated. "Thee," says
Martianus Capella, in his hymn to the Sun, "the dwellers on the Nile
adore as Serapis, and Memphis worships as Osiris; in the sacred rites of
Persia thou art Mithras, in Phrygia, Atys, and Libya bows down to thee
as Ammon, and Phœnician Byblos as Adonis; and thus the whole world
adores thee under different names."

OSIRIS was the son of Helios (Phra), the "divine offspring con-generate
with the dawn," and at the same time an incarnation of Kneph or
Agathodæmon, the Good Spirit, including all his possible manifestations,
either physical or moral. He represented in a familiar form the
beneficent aspect of all higher emanations and

<span id="page_588">p. 588</span>

in him was developed the conception of a Being purely good, so that it
became necessary to set up another power as his adversary, called Seth,
Babys or Typhon, to account for the injurious influences of Nature.

With the phenomena of agriculture, supposed to be the invention of
Osiris, the Egyptians connected the highest truths of their religion.
The soul of man was as the seed hidden in the ground, and the mortal
framework, similarly consigned to its dark resting-place, awaited its
restoration to life's unfailing source. Osiris was not only benefactor
of the living; he was also Hades, Serapis, and Rhadamanthus, the monarch
of the dead. Death, therefore, in Egyptian opinion, was only another
name for renovation, since its God is the same power who incessantly
renews vitality in Nature. Every corpse duly embalmed was called
"Osiris," and in the grave was supposed to be united, or at least
brought into approximation, to the Divinity. For when God became
incarnate for man's benefit, it was implied that, in analogy with His
assumed character, He should submit to all the conditions of visible
existence. In death, as in life, Isis and Osiris were patterns and
precursors of mankind; their sepulchres stood within the temples of the
Superior Gods; yet though their remains might be entombed at Memphis or
Abydus, their divinity was unimpeached, and they either shone as
luminaries in the heavens, or in the unseen world presided over the
futurity of the disembodied spirits whom death had brought nearer to
them.

The notion of a dying God, so frequent in Oriental legend, and of which
we have already said much in former Degrees, was the natural inference
from a literal interpretation of nature-worship; since nature, which in
the vicissitudes of the seasons seems to undergo a dissolution, was to
the earliest religionists the express image of the Deity, and at a
remote period one and the same with the "varied God," whose attributes
were seen not only in its vitality, but in its changes. The unseen Mover
of the Universe was rashly identified with its obvious fluctuations. The
speculative Deity suggested by the drama of nature, was worshipped with
imitative and sympathetic rites. A period of mourning about the Autumnal
Equinox, and of joy at the return of Spring, was almost universal.
Phrygians and Paphlagonians, Bœotians, and even Athenians, were all more
or less attached to such observances; the Syrian damsels sat weeping for
Thammuz or Adoni, mortally

<span id="page_589">p. 589</span>

wounded by the tooth of Winter, symbolized by the boar, its very general
emblem: and these rites, and those of Atys and Osiris, were evidently
suggested by the arrest of vegetation, when the Sun, descending from his
altitude, seems deprived of his generating power.

Osiris is a being analogous to the Syrian ADONI; and the fable of his
history, which we need not here repeat, is a narrative form of the
popular religion of Egypt, of which the Sun is the Hero, and the
agricultural calendar the moral. The moist valley of the Nile, owing its
fertility to the annual inundation, appeared, in contrast with the
surrounding desert, like life in the midst of death. The inundation was
in evident dependence on the Sun, and Egypt, environed with arid
deserts, like a heart within a burning censer, was the female power,
dependent on the influences personified in its God. Typhon his brother,
the type of darkness, drought, and sterility, threw his body into the
Nile; and thus Osiris, the "good," the "Saviour," perished, in the 28th
year of his life or reign, and on the 17th day of the month Athor, or
the 13th of November. He is also made to die during the heats of the
early Summer, when, from March to July, the earth was parched with
intolerable heat, vegetation was scorched, and the languid Nile
exhausted. From that death he rises when the Solstitial Sun brings the
inundation, and Egypt is filled with mirth and acclamation anticipatory
of the second harvest. From his Wintry death he rises with the early
flowers of Spring, and then the joyful festival of Osiris found was
celebrated.

So the pride of Jemsheed, one of the Persian Sun-heroes, or the solar
year personified, was abruptly cut off by Zohak, the tyrant of the West.
He was sawn asunder by a fish-bone, and immediately the brightness of
Iran changed to gloom. Ganymede and Adonis, like Osiris, were hurried
off in all their strength and beauty; the premature death of Linus, the
burthen of the ancient lament of Greece, was like that of the Persian
Siamek, the Bithynian Hylas, and the Egyptian Maneros, Son of Menes or
the Eternal. The elegy called Maneros was sung at Egyptian banquets, and
an effigy enclosed within a diminutive Sarcophagus was handed round to
remind the guests of their brief tenure of existence. The beautiful
Memnon, also, perished in his prime; and Enoch, whose early death was
lamented at Iconium, lived 365 years, the number of

<span id="page_590">p. 590</span>

days of the solar year; a brief space when compared with the longevity
of his patriarchal kindred.

The story of Osiris is reflected in those of Orpheus and Dionusos
Zagreus, and perhaps in the legends of Absyrtus and Pelias, of Æson,
Thyestes, Melicertes, Itys, and Pelops. Io is the disconsolate Isis or
Niobe: and Rhea mourns her dismembered Lord, Hyperion, and the death of
her son Helios, drowned in the Eridanus; and if Apollo and Dionusos are
immortal, they had died under other names, as Orpheus, Linus, or
Hyacinthus. The sepulchre of Zeus was shown in Crete. Hippolytus was
associated in divine honors with Apollo, and after he had been torn to
pieces like Osiris, was restored to life by the Pæonian herbs of Diana,
and kept darkling in the secret grove of Egeria. Zeus deserted Olympus
to visit the Ethiopians; Apollo underwent servitude to Admetus; Theseus,
Peirithous, Hercules, and other heroes, descended for a time to Hades; a
dying Nature-God was exhibited in the Mysteries, the Attic women fasted,
sitting on the ground, during the Thesmophoria, and the Bœotians
lamented the descent of Cora-Proserpine to the Shades.

But the death of the Deity, as understood by the Orientals, was not
inconsistent with His immortality. The temporary decline of the Sons of
Light is but an episode in their endless continuity; and as the day and
year are more convenient subdivisions of the Infinite, so the fiery
deaths of Phaëthon or Hercules are but breaks in the same Phœnix process
of perpetual regeneration, by which the spirit of Osiris lives forever
in the succession of the Memphian Apis. Every year witnesses the revival
of Adonis; and the amber tears shed by the Heliades for the premature
death of their brother, are the golden shower full of prolific hope, in
which Zeus descends from the brazen vault of Heaven into the bosom of
the parched ground.

BAL, representative or personification of the sun, was one of the Great
Gods of Syria, Assyria, and Chaldea, and his name is found upon the
monuments of Nimroud, and frequently occurs in the Hebrew writings. He
was the Great Nature-God of Babylonia, the Power of heat, life, and
generation. His symbol was the Sun, and he was figured seated on a bull.
All the accessories of his great temple at Babylon, described by
Herodotus, are repeated with singular fidelity, but on a smaller scale,
in the Hebrew tabernacle and temple. The golden statue alone is wanted
to complete

<span id="page_591">p. 591</span>

the resemblance. The word *Bal* or *Baal*, like the word *Adon*,
signifies Lord and Master. He was also the Supreme Deity of the
Moabites, Amonites, and Carthaginians, and of the Sabeans in general;
the Gauls worshipped the Sun under the name of Belin or Belinus: and
Bela is found among the Celtic Deities upon the ancient monuments.

The Northern ancestors of the Greeks maintained with hardier habits a
more manly style of religious symbolism than the effeminate enthusiasts
of the South, and had embodied in their *Perseus*, HERCULES and MITHRAS,
the consummation of the qualities they esteemed and exercised.

Almost every nation will be found to have had a mythical being, whose
strength or weakness, virtues or defects, more or less nearly describe
the Sun's career through the seasons. There was a Celtic, a Teutonic, a
Scythian, an Etruscan, a Lydian Hercules, all whose legends became
tributary to those of the Greek hero. The name of Hercules was found by
Herodotus to have been long familiar in Egypt and the East, and to have
originally belonged to a much higher personage than the comparatively
modern hero known in Greece as the Son of Alcmena. The temple of the
Hercules of Tyre was reported to have been built 2300 years before the
time of Herodotus; and Hercules, whose Greek name has been sometimes
supposed to be of Phœnician origin, in the sense of Circuitor, *i.e.*
"rover" and "perambulator" of earth, as well as "Hyperion" of the sky,
was the patron and model of those famous navigators who spread his
altars from coast to coast through the Mediterranean, to the extremities
of the West, where "ARKALEUS" built the City of Gades, and where a
perpetual fire burned in his service. He was the lineal descendant of
Perseus, the luminous child of darkness, conceived within a subterranean
vault of brass; and he a representation of the Persian Mithras, rearing
his emblematic lions above the gates of Mycenæ, and bringing the sword
of Jemsheed to battle against the Gorgons of the West. Mithras is
similarly described in the Zend-Avesta as the "mighty hero, the rapid
runner, whose piercing eye embraces all, whose arm bears the club for
the destruction of the Darood."

Hercules Ingeniculus, who, bending on one knee, uplifts his club and
tramples on the Serpent's head, was, like Prometheus and Tantalus, one
of the varying aspects of the struggling and declining Sun. The
victories of Hercules are but exhibitions of

<span id="page_592">p. 592</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Solar power which
have ever to be repeated. It was in the far North, among the
Hyperboreans, that, divested of his Lion's skin, he lay down to sleep,
and for a time lost the horses of his chariot. Henceforth that Northern
region of gloom, called the "place of the death and revival of Adonis,"
that Caucasus whose summit was so lofty, that, like the Indian Meru, it
seemed to be both the goal and commencement of the Sun's career, became
to Greek imaginations the final bourne of all things, the abode of
Winter and desolation, the pinnacle of the arch connecting the upper and
lower world, and consequently the appropriate place for the banishment
.of Prometheus. The daughters of Israel, weeping for Thammuz, mentioned
by Ezekiel, sat looking to the North, and waiting for his return from
that region. It was while Cybele with the Sun-God was absent among the
Hyperboreans, that Phrygia, abandoned by her, suffered the horrors of
famine. Delos and Delphi awaited the return of Apollo from the
Hyperboreans, and Hercules brought thence to Olympia the olive. To all
Masons, the North has immemorially been the place of darkness; and of
the great lights of the Lodge, none is in the North.

Mithras, the rock-born hero (Πετρογενης), heralded the Sun's return in
Spring, as Prometheus, chained in his cavern, betokened the continuance
of Winter. The Persian beacon on the mountain-top represented the
Rock-born Divinity enshrined in his worthiest temple; and the funeral
conflagration of Hercules was the sun dying in glory behind the Western
hills. But though the transitory manifestation suffers or dies, the
abiding and eternal power liberates and saves. It was an essential
attribute of a Titan, that he should arise again after his fall; for the
revival of Nature is as certain as its decline, and its alternations are
subject to the appointment of a power which controls them both.

"God," says Maximus Tyrius, "did not spare His own Son \[Hercules\], or
exempt Him from the calamities incidental to humanity. The Theban
progeny of Jove had his share of pain and trial. By vanquishing earthly
difficulties he proved his affinity with Heaven. His life was a
continuous struggle. He fainted before Typhon in the desert; and in the
commencement of the Autumnal season (cum longæ redit hora noctis),
descended under the guidance of Minerva to Hades. He died; but first
applied for initiation to Eumolpus, in order to foreshadow that state of
religious preparation which should precede the momentous change. Even in
Hades he

<span id="page_593">p. 593</span>

rescued Theseus and removed the stone of Ascalaphus, reanimated the
bloodless spirits, and dragged into the light of day the monster
Cerberus, justly reputed invincible because an emblem of Time itself; he
burst the chains of the grave (for Busiris is the grave personified),
and triumphant at the close as in the dawn of his career, was received
after his labors into the repose of the heavenly mansions, living
forever with Zeus in the arms of Eternal Youth.

ODIN is said to have borne twelve names among the old Germans, and to
have had 114 names besides. He was the Apollo of the Scandinavians, and
is represented in the Voluspa as destined to slay the monstrous snake.
Then the Sun will be extinguished, the earth be dissolved in the ocean,
the stars lose their brightness, and all Nature be destroyed in order
that it may be renewed again. From the bosom of the waters a new world
will emerge clad in verdure; harvests will be seen to ripen where no
seed was sown, and evil will disappear.

The free fancy of the ancients, which wove the web of their myths and
legends, was consecrated by faith. It had not, like the modern mind, set
apart a petty sanctuary of borrowed beliefs, beyond which all the rest
was common and unclean. Imagination, reason, and religion circled round
the same symbol; and in all their symbols there was serious meaning, if
we could but find it out. They did not devise fictions in the same vapid
spirit in which we, cramped by conventionalities, read them. In
endeavoring to interpret creations of fancy, fancy as well as reason
must guide: and much of modern controversy arises out of heavy
misapprehensions off ancient symbolism.

To those ancient peoples, this earth was the centre of the Universe. To
them there were no other worlds, peopled with living beings, to divide
the care and attention of the Deity. To them the world was a great
plain, of unknown, perhaps inconceivable limits, and the Sun, the Moon,
and the Stars journeyed above it, to give them light. The worship of the
Sun became the basis of all the religions of antiquity. To them light
and heat were mysteries; as indeed they still are to us. As the Sun
caused the day, and his absence the night; as, when he journeyed
Northward, Spring and Summer followed him; and when he again turned to
the South, Autumn and inclement Winter, and cold and long dark nights
ruled the earth; . . . as his influence produced the leaves and flowers,
and ripened the harvests, and brought regular inundation,

<span id="page_594">p. 594</span>

he necessarily became to them the most interesting object of the
material Universe. To them he was the innate fire of bodies, the fire of
nature. Author of Life, heat, and ignition, he was to them the efficient
cause of all generation, for without him there was no movement, no
existence, no form. He was to them immense, indivisible, imperishable,
and everywhere present. It was their need of light, and of his creative
energy, that was felt by all men; and nothing was more fearful to them
than his absence. His beneficent influences caused his identification
with the Principle of Good; and the BRAHMA of the Hindu\_s, the MITHRAS
of the Persians, and ATHOM, AMUN, PHTHA, and OSIRIS, of the Egyptians,
the BEL of the Chaldæans, the ADONAI of the Phœnicians, the ADONIS and
APOLLO of the Greeks became but personifications of the Sun, the
regenerating Principle, image of that fecundity which perpetuates and
rejuvenates the world's existence.

So too the struggle between the Good and Evil Principles was
personified, as was that between life and death, destruction and
re-creation; in allegories and fables which poetically represented the
apparent course of the Sun; who, descending toward the Southern
Hemisphere, was figuratively said to be conquered and put to death by
darkness, or the genius of Evil; but, returning again toward the
Northern Hemisphere, he seemed to be victorious, and to arise from the
tomb. This death and resurrection were also figurative of the succession
of day and night, of death, which is a necessity of life, and of life
which is born of death; and everywhere the ancients still saw the combat
between the two Principles that ruled the world. Everywhere this contest
was embodied in allegories and fictitious histories: into which were
ingeniously woven all the astronomical phenomena that accompanied,
preceded, or followed the different movements of the Sun, and the
changes of Seasons, the approach or withdrawal of inundation. And thus
grew into stature and strange proportions the histories of the contests
between Typhon and Osiris, Hercules and Juno, the Titans and Jupiter,
Ormuzd and Ahriman, the rebellious Angels and the Deity, the Evil Genii
and the Good; and the other like fables, found not only in Asia, but in
the North of Europe, and even among the Mexicans and Peruvians of the
New World; carried thither, in all probability, by those Phœnician
voyagers who bore thither civilization and the arts. The Scythians
lamented the death of Acmon, the Persians that of Zohak conquered

<span id="page_595">p. 595</span>

by Pheridoun, the Hindus that of Soura-Parama slain by Soupra-Muni, as
the Scandinavians did that of Balder, torn to pieces by the blind
Hother.

The primitive idea of infinite space existed in the first men, as it
exists in us. It and the idea of infinite time are the first two innate
ideas. Man cannot conceive how thing can be added to thing, or event
follow event, forever. The idea will ever return, that no matter how
long bulk is added to bulk, there must be, still beyond, an empty void
*without* limit; in which is *nothing*. In the same way the idea of time
without beginning or end forces itself on him. *Time*, without events,
is also a *void*, and *nothing*.

In that empty void space the primitive men knew there was no light nor
warmth. They *felt*, what we know scientifically, that there must be a
thick darkness there, and an intensity of cold of which we have no
conception. Into that void they thought the Sun, the Planets, and the
Stars went down when they set under the Western Horizon. Darkness was to
them an enemy, a harm, a vague dread and terror. It was the very
embodiment of the evil principle; and out of it they said that he was
formed. As the Sun bent Southward toward that void, they shuddered with
dread: and when, at the Winter Solstice, he again commenced his
Northward march, they rejoiced and feasted; as they did at the Summer
Solstice, when most he appeared to smile upon them in his pride of
place. These days have been celebrated by all civilized nations ever
since. The Christian has made them feast-days of the church, and
appropriated them to the two Saints John; and Masonry has done the same.

We, to whom the vast Universe has become but a great *machine*, not
instinct with a great SOUL, but a *clockwork* of proportions
unimaginable, but still infinitely less than infinite; and part at least
of which we with our orreries can imitate; we, who have measured the
distances and dimensions, and learned the specific gravity and
determined the orbits of the moon and the planets; we, who know the
distance to the sun, and his size; have measured the orbits of the
flashing comets, and the distances of the fixed stars; and know the
latter to be suns like our sun, each with his retinue of worlds, and all
governed by the same unerring, mechanical laws and outwardly imposed
forces, centripetal and centrifugal; we, who with our telescopes have
separated the galaxy and the nebula into other stars and groups of
stars; discovered

<span id="page_596">p. 596</span>

new planets, by first discovering their disturbing forces upon those
already known; and learned that they all, Jupiter, Venus, and the fiery
Mars, and Saturn and the others, as well as the bright, mild, and
ever-changing Moon, are mere dark, dull, opaque clods like our earth,
and not living orbs of brilliant fire and heavenly light; we, who have
counted the mountains and chasms in the moon, with glasses that could
distinctly reveal to us the temple of Solomon, if it stood there in its
old original glory; we, who no longer imagine that the stars control our
destinies, and who can calculate the eclipses of the sun and moon,
backward and forward, for ten thousand years; we, with our vastly
increased conceptions of the powers of the Grand Architect of the
Universe, but our wholly material and mechanical view of that Universe
itself; we cannot, even in the remotest degree, *feel*, though we may
partially and imperfectly *imagine*, how those great, primitive,
simple-hearted children of Nature felt in regard to the Starry Hosts,
there upon the slopes of the Himalayas, on the Chaldæan plains, in the
Persian and Median deserts, and upon the banks of that great, strange
River, the Nile. To them the Universe was *alive*--instinct with forces
and powers, mysterious and beyond their comprehension. To them it was no
machine, no great system of clockwork; but a great live creature, an
army of creatures, in sympathy with or inimical to man. To them, all was
a mystery and a miracle, and the stars flashing overhead spoke to their
hearts almost in an audible language. Jupiter, with his kingly
splendors, was the Emperor of the starry legions. Venus looked lovingly
on the earth and blessed it; Mars, with his crimson fires, threatened
war and misfortune; and Saturn, cold and grave, chilled and repelled
them. The ever-changing Moon, faithful companion of the Sun, was a
constant miracle and wander; the Sun himself the visible emblem of the
creative and generative power. To them the earth was a great plain, over
which the sun, the moon, and the planets revolved, its servants, framed
to give it light. Of the stars, some were beneficent existences that
brought with them Spring-time and fruits and flowers,--some, faithful
sentinels, advising them of coming inundation, of the season of storm
and of deadly winds; some heralds of evil, which, steadily foretelling,
they seemed to cause. To them the eclipses were portents of evil, and
their causes hidden in mystery, and supernatural. The regular returns of
the stars, the comings of Arcturus, Orion,

<span id="page_597">p. 597</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Sirius, the
Pleiades, and Aldebarán, and the journeyings of the Sun, were voluntary
and not mechanical to them. What wonder that astronomy became to them
the most important of sciences; that those who learned it became rulers;
and that vast edifices, the Pyramids, the tower or temple of Bel, and
other like erections everywhere in the East, were builded for
astronomical purposes?--and what wonder that, in their great child-like
simplicity, they worshipped Light, the Sun, the Planets, and the Stars,
and personified them, and eagerly believed in the histories invented for
them; in that age when the capacity for belief was infinite; as indeed,
if we but reflect, it still is and ever will be?

If we adhered to the literally historic sense, antiquity would be a mere
inexplicable, hideous chaos, and all the Sages deranged: and so it would
be with Masonry and those who instituted it. But when these allegories
are explained, they cease to be absurd fables, or facts purely local;
and become lessons of wisdom for entire humanity. No one can doubt, who
studies them, that they all came from a common source.

And he greatly errs who imagines that, because the mythological legends
and fables of antiquity are referable to and have their foundation in
the phenomena of the Heavens, and all the Heathen Gods are but mere
names given to the Sun, the Stars, the Planets, the Zodiacal Signs, the
Elements, the Powers of Nature, and Universal Nature herself, therefore
the first men worshipped the Stars, and whatever things, animate and
inanimate, seemed to them to possess and exercise a power or influence,
evident or imagined, over human, fortunes and human destiny.

For ever, in all the nations, ascending to the remotest antiquity to
which the light of History or the glimmerings of tradition reach, we
find, seated above all the gods which represent the luminaries and the
elements, and those which personify the innate Powers of universal
nature, a still higher Deity, silent, undefined, incomprehensible, the
Supreme, one God, from Whom all the rest flow or emanate, or by Him are
created. Above the Time-God Horus, the Moon-Goddess or Earth-Goddess
Isis, and the Sun-God Osiris, of the Egyptians, was Amun, the
Nature-God; and above him, again, the Infinite, Incomprehensible Deity,
ATHOM. BREHM, the silent, self-contemplative, one original God, was the
Source, to the Hindu\_s, of Brahma, Vishnu, and Siva. Above Zeus, or
before him, were Kronos and Ouranos. Over the Alohayim was the great

<span id="page_598">p. 598</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Nature-God AL, and
still beyond him, Abstract Existence, IHUH--He that IS, WAS, and SHALL
BE. Above all the Persian Deities was the Unlimited Time,
ZERUANE-AKHERENE; and over Odin and Thor was the Great Scandinavian
Deity ALFADIR.

The worship of Universal Nature as a God was too near akin to the
worship of a Universal Soul, to have been the instinctive creed of any
savage people or rude race of men. To imagine all nature, with all its
apparently independent parts, as forming one consistent whole, and as
itself a unit, required an amount of experience and a faculty of
generalization not possessed by the rude uncivilized mind, and is but a
step below the idea of a universal Soul.

In the beginning man had the WORD; and that WORD was from God; and out
of the living POWER communicated to man in and by that WORD, came THE
LIGHT of His Existence.

God made man in His own likeness. When, by a long succession of
geological changes, He had prepared the earth to be his habitation, He
created him, and placed him in that part of Asia which all the old
nations agreed in calling the cradle of the human race, and whence
afterward the stream of human life flowed forth to India, China, Egypt,
Persia, Arabia, and Phœnicia. HE communicated to him a knowledge of the
nature of his Creator, and of the pure, primitive, undefiled religion.
The peculiar and distinctive excellence and real essence of the
primitive man, and his true nature and destiny, consisted in his
likeness to God. HE stamped His own image upon man's soul. That image
has been, in the breast of every individual man and of mankind in
general, greatly altered, impaired, and defaced; but its old,
half-obliterated characters are still to be found on all the pages of
primitive history; and the impress, not entirely effaced, every
reflecting mind may discover in its own interior.

Of the original revelation to mankind, of the primitive WORD of Divine
TRUTH, we find clear indications and scattered traces in the sacred
traditions of all the primitive Nations; traces which, when separately
examined, appear like the broken remnants, the mysterious and
hieroglyphic characters, of a mighty edifice that has been destroyed;
and its fragments, like those of the old Temples and Palaces of Nimroud,
wrought incongruously into edifices many centuries younger. And,
although amid the ever-growing degeneracy of mankind, this primeval word
of revelation was

<span id="page_599">p. 599</span>

falsified by the admixture of various errors, and overlaid and obscured
by numberless and manifold fictions, inextricably confused, and
disfigured almost beyond the power of recognition, still a profound
inquiry will discover in heathenism many luminous vestiges of primitive
Truth.

For the old Heathenism had everywhere a foundation in Truth; and if we
could separate that pure intuition into nature and into the simple
symbols of nature, that constituted the basis of all Heathenism, from
the alloy of error and the additions of fiction, those first
hieroglyphic traits of the instinctive science of the first men, would
be found to agree with truth and a true knowledge of nature, and to
afford an image of a free, pure, comprehensive, and finished philosophy
of life.

The struggle, thenceforward to be eternal, between the Divine will and
the natural will in the souls of men, commenced immediately after the
creation. Cain slew his brother Abel, and went forth to people parts of
the earth with an impious race, forgetters and defiers of the true God.
The other Descendants of the Common Father of the race intermarried with
the daughters of Cain's Descendants: and all nations preserved the
remembrance of that division of the human family into the righteous and
impious, in their distorted legends of the wars between the Gods, and
the Giants and Titans. When, afterward, another similar division
occurred, the Descendants of Seth alone preserved the true primitive
religion and science, and transmitted them to posterity in the ancient
symbolical character, on monuments of stone: and many nations preserved
in their legendary traditions the memory of the columns of Enoch and
Seth.

Then the world declined from its original happy condition and fortunate
estate, into idolatry and barbarism: but all nations retained the memory
of that old estate; and the poets, in those early days the only
historians, commemorated the succession of the ages of gold, silver,
brass, and iron.

In the lapse of those ages, the sacred tradition followed various
courses among each of the most ancient nations; and from its original
source, as from a common centre, its various streams flowed downward;
some diffusing through favored regions of the world fertility and life;
but others soon losing themselves, and being dried up in the sterile
sands of human error.

After the internal and Divine WORD originally communicated

<span id="page_600">p. 600</span>

by God to man, had become obscured; after man's connection with his
Creator had been broken, even outward language necessarily fell into
disorder and confusion. The simple and Divine Truth was overlaid with
various and sensual fictions, buried under illusive symbols, and at last
perverted into horrible phantoms.

For in the progress of idolatry it needs came to pass, that what was
originally revered as the symbol of a higher principle, became gradually
confounded or identified with the object itself, and was worshipped;
until this error led to a more degraded form of idolatry. The early
nations received much from the primeval source of sacred tradition; but
that haughty pride which seems an inherent part of human nature led each
to represent these fragmentary relics of original truth as a possession
peculiar to themselves; thus exaggerating their value, and their own
importance, as peculiar favorites of the Deity, who had chosen them as
the favored people to whom to commit these truths. To make these
fragments, as far as possible, their private property, they reproduced
them under peculiar forms, wrapped them up in symbols, concealed them in
allegories, and invented fables to account for their own special
possession of them. So that, instead of preserving in their primitive
simplicity and purity these blessings of original revelation, they
overlaid them with poetical ornament; and the whole wears a fabulous
aspect, until by close and severe examination we discover the truth
which the apparent fable contains.

These being the conflicting elements in the breast of man; the old
inheritance or original dowry of truth, imparted to him by God in the
primitive revelation; and error, or the foundation for error, in his
degraded sense and spirit now turned from God to nature, false faiths
easily sprung up and grew rank and luxuriant, when the Divine Truth was
no longer guarded with jealous care, nor preserved in its pristine
purity. This soon happened among most Eastern nations, and especially
the Indians, the Chaldæans, the Arabians, the Persians, and the
Egyptians; with whom imagination, and a very deep but still sensual
feeling for nature, were very predominant. The Northern firmament,
visible to their eyes, possesses by far the largest and most brilliant
constellations; and they were more alive to the impressions made by such
objects, than are the men of the present day.

With the Chinese, a patriarchal, simple, and secluded people,

<span id="page_601">p. 601</span>

idolatry long made but little progress. They invented writing within
three or four generations after the flood; and they long preserved the
memory of much of the primitive revelation; less overlaid with fiction
than those fragments which other nations have remembered. They were
among those who stood nearest to the source of sacred tradition; and
many passages in their old writings contain remarkable vestiges of
eternal truth, and of the WORD of primitive revelation, the heritage of
old thought, which attest to us their original eminence.

But among the other early nations, a wild enthusiasm and a sensual
idolatry of nature soon superseded the simple worship of the Almighty
God, and set aside or disfigured the pure belief in the Eternal
Uncreated Spirit. The great powers and elements of nature, and the vital
principle of production and procreation through all generations; then
the celestial spirits or heavenly Host, the luminous armies of the
Stars, and the great Sun, and mysterious, ever-changing Moon (all of
which the whole ancient world regarded not as mere globes of light or
bodies of fire, but as animated living substances, potent over man's
fate and destinies); next the genii and tutelar spirits, and even the
souls of the dead, received divine worship. The animals, representing
the starry constellations, first reverenced as symbols merely, came to
be worshipped as gods; the heavens, earth, and the operations of nature
were personified; and fictitious personages invented to account for the
introduction of science and arts, and the fragments of the old religious
truths; and the good and bad principles personified, became also objects
of worship; while, through all, still shone the silver threads .of the
old primitive revelation.

Increasing familiarity with early oriental records seems more and more
to confirm the probability that they all originally emanated from one
source. The eastern and southern slopes of the Paropismus, or
Hindukusch, appear to have been inhabited by kindred Iranian races,
similar in habits, language, and religion. The earliest Indian and
Persian Deities are for the most part symbols of celestial light, their
agency being regarded as an eternal warfare with the powers of Winter,
storm, and darkness. The religion of both was originally a worship of
outward nature, especially the manifestations of fire and light; the
coincidences being too marked to be merely accidental. Deva, God, is
derived from the root *div*, to shine. Indra, like Ormuzd or
Ahura-Mazda,

<span id="page_602">p. 602</span>

is the bright firmament; Sura or Surya, the Heavenly, a name of the Sun,
recurs in the Zend word Huare, the Sun, whence Khur and Khorshid or
Corasch. Uschas and Mitra are Medic as well as Zend Deities and the
Amschaspands or "immortal Holy Ones" of the Zend-Avesta may be compared
with the seven Rishis or Vedic Star-God, of the constellation of the
Bear. Zoroastrianism, like Buddhism, was an innovation in regard to an
older religion; and between the Parsee and Brahmin may be found traces
of disruption as well as of coincidence. The original Nature-worship, in
which were combined the conceptions both of a Universal Presence and
perpetuity of action, took different directions of development,
according to the difference between the Indian and Persian mind.

The early shepherds of the Punjaub, then called the country of the Seven
Rivers, to whose intuitional or inspired wisdom (Veda) we owe what are
perhaps the most ancient religious effusions extant in any language,
apostrophized as living beings the physical objects of their worship.
First in this order of Deities stands Indra, the God of the "blue" or
"glittering" firmament, called Devaspiti, Father of the Devas or
Elemental Powers, who measured out the circle of the sky, and made fast
the foundations of the Earth; the ideal domain of Varouna, "the
All-encompasser," is almost equally extensive, including air, water,
night, the expanse between Heaven and Earth; Agni, who lives on the fire
of the sacrifice, on the domestic hearth, and in the lightnings of the
sky, is the great Mediator between God and Man; Uschas, or the Dawn,
leads forth the Gods in the morning to make their daily repast in the
intoxicating Soma of Nature's offertory, of which the Priest could only
compound from simples a symbolical imitation. Then came the various
Sun-Gods, Adityas or Solar Attributes, Surya the Heavenly, Savitri the
Progenitor, Pashan the Nourisher, Bagha the Felicitous, and Mitra the
Friend.

The coming forth of the Eternal Being to the work of creation was
represented as a marriage, his first emanation being a universal mother,
supposed to have potentially existed with him from Eternity, or, in
metaphorical language, to have been "his sister and his spouse." She
became eventually promoted to be the Mother of the Indian Trinity, of
the Deity under His three Attributes, of Creation, Preservation, and
Change or Regeneration.

The most popular forms or manifestations of Vishnu the Pre-server, were
his successive avataras or historic impersonations,

<span id="page_603">p. 603</span>

which represented the Deity coming forth out of the incomprehensible
mystery of His nature, and revealing Himself at those critical epochs
which either in the physical or moral world seemed to mark a new
commencement of prosperity and order. Combating the power of Evil in the
various departments of Nature, and in successive periods of time, the
Divinity, though varying in form, is ever in reality the same, whether
seen in useful agricultural or social inventions, in traditional
victories over rival creeds, or in physical changes faintly discovered
through tradition, or suggested by cosmogonical theory. As Rama, the
Epic hero armed with sword, club, and arrows, the prototype of Hercules
and Mithras, he wrestles like the Hebrew Patriarch with the Powers of
Darkness; as Chrishna-Govinda, the Divine Shepherd, he is the Messenger
of Peace, overmastering the world by music and love. Under the human
form he never ceases to be the Supreme Being. "The foolish" (he says, in
Bhagavad Ghita), "unacquainted with my Supreme Nature, despise me in
this human form, while men of great minds, enlightened by the Divine
principle within them, acknowledge me as incorruptible and before all
things, and serve me with undivided hearts." "I am not recognized by
all," he says again, "because concealed by the supernatural power which
is in me; yet to me are known all things past, present, and to come; I
existed before Vaivaswata and Menou. I am the Most High God, the Creator
of the World, the Eternal Poorooscha (Man-World or Genius of the World).
And although in my own nature I am exempt from liability to birth or
death, and am Lord of all created things, yet as often as in the world
virtue is enfeebled, and vice and injustice prevail, so often do I
become manifest and am revealed from age to age, to save the just, to
destroy the guilty, and to reassure the faltering steps of virtue. He
who acknowledgeth me as even so, doth not on quitting this mortal frame
enter into another, for he entereth into me; and many who have trusted
in me have already entered into me, being purified by the power of
wisdom. I help those who walk in my path, even as they serve me."

Brahma, the creating agent, [sacrificed](errata.htm#27.md) himself, when,
by descending into material forms, he became incorporated with his work;
and his mythological history was interwoven with that of the Universe.
Thus, although spiritually allied to the Supreme, and Lord of all
creatures (Prajapati), he shared the imperfection and

<span id="page_604">p. 604</span>

corruption of an inferior nature, and, steeped in manifold and
perishable forms, might be said, like the Greek Uranus, to be mutilated
and fallen. He thus combined two characters, formless form, immortal and
mortal, being and non-being, motion and rest. As Incarnate Intelligence,
or THE WORD, he communicated to man what had been revealed to himself by
the Eternal, since he is creation's Soul as well as Body, within which
the Divine Word is written in those living letters which it is the
prerogative of the self-conscious spirit to interpret.

The fundamental principles of the religion of the Hindi's consisted in
the belief in the existence of One Being only, of the immortality of the
soul, and of a future state of rewards and punishments. Their precepts
of morality inculcate the practice of virtue as necessary for procuring
happiness even in this transient life; and their religious doctrines
make their felicity in a future state to depend upon it.

Besides their doctrine of the transmigration of souls, their dogmas may
be epitomized under the following heads: 1st. The existence of one God,
from Whom all things proceed, and to Whom all must return. To him they
constantly apply these expressions--The Universal and Eternal Essence;
that which has ever been and will ever continue; that which vivifies and
pervades all things; He who is everywhere present, and causes the
celestial bodies to revolve in the course He has prescribed to them. 2d.
A tripartite division of the Good Principle, for the purposes of
Creation, Preservation, and Renovation by change and death. 3d. The
necessary existence of an Evil Principle, occupied in counteracting the
benevolent purposes of the first, in their execution by the Devata or
Subordinate Genii, to whom is entrusted the control over the various
operations of nature.

And this was part of their doctrine: "One great and incomprehensible
Being has alone existed from all Eternity. Everything we behold and we
ourselves are portions of Him. The soul, mind or intellect, of gods and
men, and of all sentient creatures, are detached portions of the
Universal Soul, to which at stated periods they are destined to return.
But the mind of finite beings is impressed by one uninterrupted series
of illusions, which they consider as real, until again united to the
great fountain of truth. Of these illusions, the first and most
essential is individuality. By its influence, when detached from its
source, the soul becomes

<span id="page_605">p. 605</span>

ignorant of its own nature, origin, and destiny. It considers itself as
a separate existence, and no longer a spark of the Divinity, a link of
one immeasurable chain, an infinitely small but indispensable portion of
one great whole."

Their love of imagery caused them to personify what they conceived to be
some of the attributes Of God, perhaps in order to present things in a
way better adapted to the comprehensions of the vulgar, than the
abstruse idea of an indescribable, invisible God; and hence the
invention of a Brahma, a Vishnu, and a Siva or Iswara. These were
represented under various forms; but no emblem or visible sign of Brihm
or Brehm, the Omnipotent, is to be found. They considered the great
mystery of the existence of the Supreme Ruler of the Universe, as beyond
human comprehension. Every creature endowed with the faculty of
thinking, they held, must be conscious of the existence of a God, a
first cause; but the attempt to explain the nature of that Being, or in
any way to assimilate it with our own, they considered not only a proof
of folly, but of extreme impiety.

The following extracts from their books will serve to show what were the
real tenets of their creed:

'By one Supreme Ruler is this Universe pervaded; even every world in the
whole circle of nature. . There is one Supreme Spirit, which nothing can
shake, more swift than the thought of man. That Supreme Spirit moves at
pleasure, but in itself is immovable; it is distant from us, yet near
us; it pervades this whole system of worlds; yet it is infinitely beyond
it. That man who considers all beings as existing even in the Supreme
Spirit, and the Supreme Spirit as pervading all beings, henceforth views
no creature with contempt.... All spiritual beings are the same in kind
with the Supreme Spirit. . . . The pure enlightened soul assumes a
luminous form, with no gross body, with no perforation, with no veins or
tendons, unblemished, untainted by sin: itself being a ray from the
Infinite Spirit, which knows the Past and the Future, which pervades
all, which existed with no cause but itself, which created all things as
they are, in ages most remote. That all-pervading Spirit which gives
light to the visible Sun, even the same in *kind* am I, though
infinitely distant in *degree*. Let my soul return to the immortal
Spirit of God, and then let my body, which ends in ashes, return to
dust! O Spirit, who pervadest fire, lead us in a straight path to the
riches of beatitude.

<span id="page_606">p. 606</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Thou, O God,
possessest all the treasures of knowledge! Remove each foul taint from
our souls!

"From what root springs mortal man, when felled by the hand of death?
Who can make him spring again to birth? God, who is perfect wisdom,
perfect happiness. He is the final refuge of the man who has liberally
bestowed his wealth, who has been firm in virtue, who knows and adores
that Great One. . . . Let us adore the supremacy of that Divine Sun, the
Godhead who illuminates all, who re-creates all, from whom all proceed,
to whom all must return, whom we invoke to direct our understandings
aright, in our progress toward his holy seat. . . . What the Sun and
Light are to this visible world, such is truth to the intellectual and
visible Universe. . . . Our souls acquire certain knowledge, by
meditating on the light of Truth, which emanates from the Being of
Beings. . . . That Being, without eyes sees, without ears hears all; he
knows whatever can be known, but there is none who knows him; him the
wise call the Great, Supreme, Pervading Spirit. . . . Perfect Truth,
Perfect Happiness, without equal, immortal; absolute unity, whom neither
speech can describe, nor mind comprehend: all-pervading,
all-transcending, delighted with his own boundless intelligence, nor
limited by space or time; without feet, running swiftly; without hands,
grasping all worlds; without eyes, all-surveying; without ears,
all-hearing; without an intelligent guide, understanding all; without
cause, the first of all causes; all-ruling, all-powerful, the Creator,
Preserver, Transformer of all things: such is the Great One; this the
Vedas declare.

"May that soul of mine, which mounts aloft in my waking hours as an
ethereal spark, and which, even in my slumber, has a like ascent,
soaring to a great distance, as an emanation from the Light of Lights,
be united by devout meditation with the Spirit supremely blest, and
supremely intelligent! . . . May that soul of mine, which was itself the
primeval oblation placed within all creatures. . . . which is a ray of
perfect wisdom, which is the inextinguishable light fixed within created
bodies, without which no good act is performed. . . . in which as an
immortal essence may be comprised whatever has passed, is present, or
will be hereafter. . . . be united by devout meditation with the Spirit
supremely blest and supremely intelligent

"The Being of Beings is the Only God, eternal and everywhere present,
Who comprises everything. There is no God but He . . . . The

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Supreme Being is
invisible, incomprehensible, immovable, without figure or shape. No one
has ever seen Him; time never comprised Him; His essence pervades
everything; all was derived from Him.

"The duty of a good man, even in the moment of his destruction, consists
not only in forgiving, but even in a desire of benefiting his destroyer;
as the sandal-tree, in the instant of its overthrow, sheds perfume on
the axe which fells it."

The Vedanta and Nyaya philosophers acknowledge a Supreme Eternal Being,
and the immortality of the soul: though, like the Greeks, they differ in
their ideas of those subjects. They speak of the Supreme Being as an
eternal essence that pervades space, and gives life or existence. Of
that universal and eternal pervading spirit, the Vedanti suppose four
modifications; but as these do not change its nature, and as it would be
erroneous to ascribe to each of them a distinct essence, so it is
equally erroneous, they say, to imagine that the various modifications
by which the All-pervading Being exists, or displays His power, are
individual existences. Creation is not considered as the instant
production of things, but only as the manifestation of that which exists
eternally in the one Universal Being. The Nyaya philosophers believe
that spirit and matter are eternal; but they do not suppose that the
world in its present form has existed from eternity, but only the
primary matter from which it sprang when operated on by the almighty
Word of God, the Intelligent Cause and Supreme Being, Who produced the
combinations or aggregations which compose the material Universe. Though
they believe that soul is an emanation from the Supreme Being, they
distinguish it from that Being, in its individual existence. Truth and
Intelligence are the eternal attributes of God, not, they say, of the
individual soul, which is susceptible Both of knowledge and ignorance,
of pleasure and pain; and therefore God and it are distinct. Even when
it returns to the Eternal, and attains supreme bliss, it undoubtedly
does not cease. Though *united* to the Supreme Being, it is not
*absorbed* in it, but still retains the abstract nature of definite or
visible existence.

"The dissolution of the world," they say, "consists in the destruction
of the visible forms and qualities of things; but their material essence
remains, and from it new worlds are formed by the creative energy of
God; and thus the Universe is dissolved and renewed in endless
succession."

<span id="page_608">p. 608</span>

The Jainas, a sect at Mysore and elsewhere, say that the ancient
religion of India and of the whole world consisted in the belief in one
God, a pure Spirit, indivisible, omniscient and all-powerful; that God,
having given to all things their appointed order and course of action,
and to man a sufficient portion of reason, or understanding, to guide
him in his conduct, leaves him to the operation of free will, without
the entire exercise of which he could not be held answerable for his
conduct.

Menou, the Hindu\_ lawgiver, adored, not the visible, material Sun, but
"that divine and incomparably greater light," to use the words of the
most venerable text in the Indian Scripture, "which illumines all,
delights all, from which all proceed, to which all must return, and
which alone can irradiate our intellects." He thus commences his
Institutes:

"Be it heard!

"This Universe existed only in the first divine idea yet unexpanded, as
if involved in darkness, imperceptible, undefinable, undiscoverable by
reason, and undiscovered by revelation, as if it were wholly immersed in
sleep:

"Then the Sole Self-existing Power, Himself undiscovered, but making
this world discernible, with five elements, and other principles of
nature, appeared with undiminished glory, *expanding His idea*, or
dispelling the gloom.

"He Whom the mind alone can perceive, whose essence eludes the eternal
organs, who has no visible parts, who exists from Eternity, even He, the
soul of all beings, Whom no being can comprehend, shone forth.

"He, having willed to produce various beings from His own divine
Substance, first with a thought created the waters.... From *that which
is* \[precisely the Hebrew ‏ו ?Y?H?W?H‎\], the first cause, not the
object of sense, existing everywhere in substance, not existing to our
perception, without beginning or end" \[the Α∴ and Ω∴, or the Ι∴Α∴Ω∴\],
"was produced the divine male famed in all worlds under the appellation
of Brahma."

Then recapitulating the different things created by Brahma, he adds:
"He," meaning Brahma \[the Λογος, the WORD\], "whose powers are
incomprehensible, having thus created this Universe, was again absorbed
in the Supreme Spirit, changing the time of energy for the time of
repose."

The *Antareya A’ran’ya*, one of the Vedas, gives this primitive

<span id="page_609">p. 609</span>

idea of the creation: "In the beginning, the Universe was but a Soul:
nothing else, active or inactive, existed. Then HE had this thought, *I
will create worlds*; and thus HE created these different worlds; air,
the light, mortal beings, and the waters.

"HE had this thought: *Behold the worlds; I will create guardians for
the worlds*. So HE took of the water and fashioned a being clothed with
the human form. He looked upon him, and of that being so contemplated,
the mouth opened like an egg, and speech came forth, and from the speech
fire. The nostrils opened, and through them went the breath of
respiration, and by it the air was propagated. The eyes opened; from
them came a luminous ray, and from it was produced the sun. The ears
dilated; from them came hearing, and from hearing space:" . . . and,
after the body of man, with the senses, was formed;--"HE, the Universal
Soul, thus reflected: *How can this body exist without Me*? He examined
through what extremity He could penetrate it. He said to Himself: *If,
without Me, the World is articulated, breath exhales, and sight sees; if
hearing hears, the skin feels, and the: mind reflects, deglutition
swallows, and the generative organ fulfils its functions, what then am
I*? And separating the suture of the cranium, He penetrated into man."

Behold the great fundamental primitive truths! God, an infinite Eternal
Soul or Spirit. Matter, not eternal nor self-existent, but
created--created by a thought of God. After matter, and worlds, then
man, by a like thought: and finally, after endowing him with the senses
and a thinking mind, a portion, a spark, of God Himself penetrates the
man, and becomes a living spirit within him.

The Vedas thus detail the creation of the world:

"In the beginning there was a single God, existing of Himself; Who,
after having passed an eternity absorbed in the contemplation of His own
being, desired to manifest His perfections outwardly of Himself; and
created the matter of the world. The four elements being thus produced,
but still mingled in confusion, He breathed upon the waters, which
swelled up into an immense ball in the shape of an. egg, and, developing
themselves, became the vault and orb of Heaven which encircles the
earth. Having made the earth and the bodies of animal beings, this God,
the essence of movement, gave to them, to animate them, a portion of His
own being. Thus, the soul of everything that breathes

<span id="page_610">p. 610</span>

being a fraction of the universal soul, none perishes; but each soul
merely changes its mould and form, by passing successively into
different bodies. Of all forms, that which most pleases the Divine Being
is Man, as nearest approaching His own perfections. When a man,
absolutely disengaging himself from his senses, absorbs himself in
self-contemplation, he comes to discern the Divinity, and becomes part
of Him."

The Ancient Persians in many respects resembled the Hindu\_s,--in their
language, their poetry, and their poetic legends. Their conquests
brought them in contact with China; and they subdued Egypt and Judea.
Their views of God and religion more resembled those of the Hebrews than
those of any other nation; and indeed the latter people borrowed from
them some prominent doctrines, that we are in the habit of regarding as
an essential part of the original Hebrew creed.

Of the King of Heaven and Father of Eternal Light, of the pure World of
LIGHT, of the Eternal WORD by which all things were created, of the
Seven Mighty Spirits that stand next to the Throne of Light and
Omnipotence, and of the glory of those Heavenly Hosts that encompass
that Throne, of the Origin of Evil, and the Prince of Darkness, Monarch
of the rebellious spirits, enemies of all good, they entertained tenets
very similar to those of the Hebrews. Toward Egyptian idolatry they felt
the strongest abhorrence, and under Cambyses pursued a regular plan for
its utter extirpation. Xerxes, when he invaded Greece, destroyed the
Temples and erected fire-chapels along the whole course of his march.
Their religion was eminently spiritual, and the earthly fire and earthly
sacrifice were but the signs and emblems of another devotion and a
higher power.

Thus the fundamental doctrine of the ancient religion of India and
Persia was at first nothing more than a simple veneration of nature, its
pure elements and its primary energies, the sacred fire, and above all,
Light, the air, not the lower atmospheric air, but the purer and
brighter air of Heaven, the breath that animates and pervades the breath
of mortal life. This pure and simple veneration of nature is perhaps the
most ancient, and was by far the most generally prevalent in the
primitive and patriarchal world. It was not originally a deification of
nature, or a denial of the sovereignty of God. Those pure elements and
primitive essences of created nature offered to the first men, still in
a close communication

<span id="page_611">p. 611</span>

with the Deity, not a likeness of resemblance, nor a mere fanciful image
or a poetical figure, but a natural and true symbol of Divine power.
Everywhere in the Hebrew writings the pure light or sacred fire is
employed as an image of the all-pervading and all-consuming power and
omnipresence of the Divinity. His breath was the first source of life;
and the faint whisper of the breeze announced to the prophet His
immediate presence.

"All things are the progeny of one fire. The Father perfected all
things, and delivered them over to the Second Mind, whom all nations of
men call the First. Natural works co-exist with the intellectual light
of the Father; for it is the Soul which adorns the great Heaven, and
which adorns it after the Father. The Soul, being a bright fire, by the
power of the Father, remains immortal, and is mistress of life, and
fills up the recesses of the world. For the fire which is first beyond,
did not shut up his power in matter by works, but by mind, for the
framer of the fiery world is the mind of mind, who first sprang from
mind, clothing fire with fire. Father-begotten Light! for He alone,
having from the Father's power received the essence of intellect, is
enabled to understand the mind of the Father; and to instill into all
sources and principles the capacity of understanding, and of ever
continuing in ceaseless revolving motion." Such was the language of
Zoroaster, embodying the old Persian ideas.

And the same ancient sage thus spoke of the Sun and Stars: "The Father
made the whole Universe of fire and water and earth, and all-nourishing
ether. He fixed a great multitude of moveless stars, that stand still
forever, not by compulsion and unwillingly, but without desire to
wander, fire acting upon fire. He congregated the seven firmaments of
the world, and so surrounded the earth with the convexity of the
Heavens; and therein set seven living existences, arranging their
apparent disorder in regular orbits, six of them planets, and the Sun,
placed in the centre, the seventh;--in that centre from which all lines,
diverging which way soever, are equal; and the swift sun himself,
revolving around a principal centre, and ever striving to reach the
central and all-pervading light, bearing with him the bright Moon."

And yet Zoroaster added: "Measure not the journeyings of the Sun, nor
attempt to reduce them to rule; for he is carried by the eternal will of
the Father, not for your sake. Do not endeavor to understand the
impetuous course of the Moon; for she runs

<span id="page_612">p. 612</span>

evermore under the impulse of necessity; and the progression of the
Stars was not generated to serve any purpose of yours."

Ormuzd says to Zoroaster, in the Boundehesch: "I am he who holds the
Star-Spangled Heaven in ethereal space; who makes this sphere, which
once was buried in darkness, a flood of light. Through me the Earth
became a world firm and lasting--the earth on which walks the Lord of
the world. I am he who makes the light of Sun, Moon, and Stars pierce
the clouds. I make the corn seed, which perishing in the ground sprouts
anew. . . . I created plan, whose eye is light, whose life is the breath
of his nostrils. I placed within him life's unextinguishable power."

Ormuzd or Ahura-Mazda himself represented the primal light, distinct
from the heavenly bodies, yet necessary to their existence, and the
source of their splendor. The Amschaspands (Ameschaspenta, "immortal
Holy Ones"), each presided over a special department of nature. Earth
and Heaven, fire and water, the Sun and Moon, the rivers, trees, and
mountains, even the artificial divisions of the day and year were
addressed in prayer as tenanted by Divine beings, each separately ruling
within his several sphere. Fire, in particular, that "most energetic of
immortal powers," the visible representative of the primal light, was
invoked as "Son of Ormuzd." The Sun, the Archimagus, that noblest and
most powerful agent of divine power, who "steps forth as a Conqueror
from the top of the terrible Alborj to rule over the world which he
enlightens from the throne of Ormuzd," was worshipped among other
symbols by the name of MITHRAS, a beneficent and friendly genius, who,
in the hymn addressed to him in the Zend-Avesta, bears the names given
him by the Greeks, as the "Invincible" and the "Mediator"; the former,
because in his daily strife with darkness he is the most active
confederate of Ormuzd; the latter, as being the medium through which
Heaven's choicest blessings are communicated to men. He is called "the
eye of Ormuzd, the effulgent Nero, pursuing his course triumphantly,
fertilizer of deserts, most exalted of the Izeds or Yezatas, the
never-sleeping, the protector of the land." "When the dragon foe
devastates my provinces," says Ormuzd, "and afflicts them with famine,
then is he struck down by the strong arm of Mithras, together with the
Devs of Mazanderan. With his lance and his immortal club, the Sleepless
Chief hurls down the Devs into the dust, when as Mediator he interposes
to guard the City from evil,"

<span id="page_613">p. 613</span>

Ahriman was by some Parsee sects considered older than Ormuzd, as
darkness is older than light; he is imagined to have been unknown as a
Malevolent Being in the early ages of the world, and the fall of man is
attributed in the Boundehesch to an apostate worship of him, from which
men were converted by a succession of prophets terminating with
Zoroaster.

Mithras is not only light, but intelligence; that luminary which, though
born in obscurity, will not only dispel darkness but conquer death. The
warfare through which this consummation is to be reached, is mainly
carried on through the instrumentality of the "Word," that "ever-living
emanation of the Deity, by virtue of which the world exists," and of
which the revealed formulas incessantly repeated in the liturgies of the
Magi are but the expression. "What shall I do," cried Zoroaster, "O
Ormuzd, steeped in brightness, in order to battle with Daroodj-Ahriman,
father of the Evil Law; how shall I make men pure and holy?" Ormuzd
answered and said: "Invoke, O Zoroaster, the pure law of the Servants of
Ormuzd; invoke the Amschaspands who shed abundance throughout the seven
Keshwars; invoke the Heaven, Zeruana-Akarana, the birds travailing on
high, the swift wind, the Earth; invoke my Spirit, me who am
Ahura-Mazda, the purest, strongest, wisest, best of beings; me who have
the most majestic body, who through purity am Supreme, whose Soul is the
Excellent Word; and ye, all people, invoke me as I have commanded
Zoroaster."

Ahura-Mazda himself is the living WORD; he is called "First-born of all
things, express image of the Eternal, very light of very light, the
Creator, who by power of the Word which he never ceases to pronounce,
made in 365 days the Heaven and the Earth." The Word is said in the
Yashna to have existed before all, and to be itself a Yazata, a
personified object of prayer. It was revealed in Serosch, in Homa, and
again, under Gushtasp, was manifested in Zoroaster.

Between life and death, between sunshine and shade, Mithras is the
present exemplification of the Primal Unity from which all things arose,
and into which, through his mediation, all contrarieties will ultimately
be absorbed. His annual sacrifice is the Passover of the Magi, a
symbolical atonement or pledge of moral and physical regeneration. He
created the world in the beginning; and as at the close of each
successive year he sets free the current of life to invigorate a fresh
circle of being, so in the

<span id="page_614">p. 614</span>

end of all things he will bring the weary sum of ages as a hecatomb
before God, releasing by a final sacrifice the Soul of Nature from her
perishable frame, to commence a brighter and purer existence.

Iamblichus (*De Mys.* viii. 4) says: "The Egyptians are far from
ascribing all things to physical causes; life and intellect they
distinguish from physical being, both in man and in the Universe. They
place intellect and reason first as self-existent, and from these they
derive the created world. As Parent of generated things they constitute
a Demiurge, and acknowledge a vital force both in the Heavens and before
the Heavens. They place Pure Intellect above and beyond the Universe,
and another (that is, Mind revealed in the Material World), consisting
of one continuous mind pervading the Universe, and apportioned to all
its parts and spheres." The Egyptian idea, then, was that of all
transcendental philosophy--that of a Deity both immanent and
transcendent--spirit passing into its manifestations, but not exhausted
by so doing.

The wisdom recorded in the canonical rolls of Hermes quickly attained in
this transcendental lore, all that human curiosity can ever discover.
Thebes especially is said to have acknowledged a being without beginning
or end, called Amun or Amun-Kneph, the [all-pervading](errata.htm#28.md)
Spirit or Breath of Nature, or perhaps even some still more lofty object
of reverential reflection, whom it was forbidden even to name. Such a
being would in theory stand at the head of the three orders of Gods
mentioned by Herodotus, these being regarded as arbitrary
classifications of similar or equal beings, arranged in successive
emanations, according to an estimate of their comparative dignity. The
Eight Great Gods, or primary class, were probably manifestations of the
emanated God in the several parts and powers of the Universe, each
potentially comprising the whole Godhead.

In the ancient Hermetic books, as quoted by Iamblichus, occurred the
following passage in regard to the Supreme Being:

"Before all the things that actually exist, and before all beginnings,
there is one God, prior even to the first God and King, remaining
unmoved in the singleness of his own Unity: for neither is anything
conceived by intellect inwoven with him, nor anything else; but he is
established as the exemplar of the God who is good, who is his own
father, self-begotten, and has only one

<span id="page_615">p. 615</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Parent. For he is
something greater and prior to, and the fountain of all things, and the
foundation of things conceived by the intellect, which are the first
species. And from this ONE, the self-originated God caused himself to
shine forth; for which reason he is his own father, and self-originated.
For he is both a beginning and God of Gods, a Monad from the One, prior
to substance and the beginning of substance; for from him is
substantiality and substance, whence also he is called the beginning of
things conceived by the intellect. These then are the most ancient
beginnings of all things, which Hermes places before the ethereal and
empyrean and celestial Gods."

"CHANG-TI, or the Supreme Lord or Being," said the old Chinese creed,
"is the principle of everything that exists, and Father of all living.
He is eternal, immovable, and independent: His power knows no bounds:
His sight equally comprehends the Past, the Present, and the Future, and
penetrates even to the inmost recesses of the heart. Heaven and earth
are under his government: all events, all revolutions, are the
consequences of his dispensation and will. He is pure, holy, and
impartial; wickedness offends his sight; but he beholds with an eye of
complacency the virtuous actions of men. Severe, yet just, he punishes
vice in an exemplary manner, even in Princes and Rulers; and often casts
down the guilty, to crown with honor the man who walks after his own
heart, and whom he raises from obscurity. Good, merciful, and full of
pity, he forgives the wicked upon their repentance: and public
calamities and the irregularity of the seasons are but salutary
warnings, which his fatherly goodness gives to men, to induce them to
reform and amend."

Controlled by reason infinitely more than by the imagination, that
people, occupying the extreme East of Asia, did not fall into idolatry
until after the time of Confucius, and within two centuries of the birth
of Christ; when the religion of BUDDHA or Fo was carried thither from
India. Their system was long regulated by the pure worship of God, and
the foundation of their moral and political existence laid in a sound,
upright reason, conformable to true ideas of the Deity. They had no
false gods or images, and their third Emperor *Hoam-ti* erected a
Temple, the first probably ever erected, to the Great Architect of the
Universe. And though they offered sacrifices to divers tutelary angels,
yet they honored

<span id="page_616">p. 616</span>

them infinitely less than XAM-TI or CHANG-TI, the Sovereign Lord of the
World.

Confucius forbade making images or representations of the Deity. He
attached no idea of personality to Him; but considered Him as a Power or
Principle, pervading all Nature. And the Chinese designated the Divinity
by the name of THE, DIVINE REASON.

The Japanese believe in a Supreme Invisible Being, not to be represented
by images or worshipped in Temples. They styled him AMIDA or OMITH; and
say that he is without beginning or end; that he came on earth, where he
remained a thousand years, and became the Redeemer of our fallen race:
that he is to judge all men; and the good are to live forever, while the
bad are to be condemned to Hell.

"The Chang-ti is represented," said Confucius, "under the general emblem
of the visible firmament, as well as under the particular symbols of the
Sun, the Moon, and the Earth, because by their means we enjoy the gifts
of the Chang-ti. The Sun is the source of life and light: the Moon
illuminates the world by night. By observing the course of these
luminaries, mankind are enabled to distinguish times and seasons. The
Ancients, with the view of connecting the act with its object, when they
established the practice of sacrificing to the Chang-ti, fixed the day
of the Winter Solstice, because the Sun, after having passed through the
twelve places assigned apparently by the Chang-ti as its annual
residence, began its career anew, to distribute blessings throughout the
Earth."

He said: "The TEEN is the universal principle and prolific source of all
things. . . . The Chang-ti is the universal principle of existence."

The Arabians never possessed a poetical, high-wrought, and
scientifically arranged system of Polytheism. Their historical
traditions had much analogy with those of the Hebrews, and coincided
with them in a variety of points. The tradition of a purer faith and the
simple Patriarchal worship of the Deity; appear never to have been
totally extinguished among them; nor did idolatry gain much foothold
until near the time of Mahomet; who, adopting the old primeval faith,
taught again the doctrine of one God, adding to it that he was His
Prophet.

To the mass of Hebrews, as well as to other nations, seem to

<span id="page_617">p. 617</span>

have come fragments only of the primitive revelation: nor do they seem,
until after their captivity among the Persians, to have concerned
themselves about metaphysical speculations in regard to the Divine
Nature and essence; although it is evident, from the Psalms of David,
that a select body among them preserved a knowledge, in regard to the
Deity, which was wholly unknown to the mass of the people; and those
chosen few were made the medium of transition for certain truths, to
later ages.

Among the Greeks, the scholars of the Egyptians, all the higher ideas
and severer doctrines on the Divinity, his Sovereign Nature and Infinite
Might, the Eternal Wisdom and Providence that conducts and directs all
things to their proper end, the Infinite Mind and Supreme Intelligence
that created all things, and is raised far above external nature,--all
these loftier ideas and nobler doctrines were expounded more or less
perfectly by Pythagoras, Anaxagoras, and Socrates, and developed in the
most beautiful and luminous manner by Plato, and the philosophers that
succeeded him. And even in the popular religion of the Greeks are many
things capable of a deeper import and more spiritual signification;
though they seem only rare vestiges of ancient truth, vague
presentiments, fugitive tones, and momentary flashes, revealing a belief
in a Supreme Being, Almighty Creator of the Universe, and Common Father
of Mankind.

Much of the primitive Truth was taught to Pythagoras by Zoroaster, who
himself received it from the Indians. His disciples rejected the use of
Temples, of Altars, and of Statues; and smiled at the folly of those
nations who imagined that the Deity sprang from or had any affinity with
human nature. The tops of the highest mountains were the places chosen
for sacrifices. Hymns and prayers were their principal worship. The
Supreme God, who fills the wide circle of Heaven, was the object to Whom
they were addressed. Such is the testimony of Herodotus. Light they
considered not so much as an object of worship, as rather the most pure
and lively emblem of, and first emanation from, the Eternal God; and
thought that man required something visible or tangible to exalt his
mind to that degree of adoration which is due to the Divine Being.

There was a surprising similarity between the Temples, Priests,
doctrines, and worship of the Persian Magi and the British Druids. The
latter did not worship idols in the human shape,

<span id="page_618">p. 618</span>

because they held that the Divinity, being invisible, ought to be adored
without being seen. They asserted the Unity of the God-head. Their
invocations were made to the One All-preserving Power; and they argued
that, as this power was not matter, it must necessarily be the Deity;
and the secret symbol used to express his name was O. I. W. They
believed that the earth had sustained one general destruction by water;
and would again be destroyed by fire. They admitted the doctrines of the
immortality of the soul, a future state, and a day of judgment, which
would be conducted on the principle of man's responsibility. They even
retained some idea of the redemption of mankind through the death of a
Mediator. They retained a tradition of the Deluge, perverted and
localized. But, around these fragments of primitive truth they wove a
web of idolatry, worshipped two Subordinate Deities under the names of
Hu and CERIDWEN, male and female (doubtless the same as Osiris and
Isis), and held the doctrine of transmigration.

The early inhabitants of Scandinavia believed in a God who was "the
Author of everything that existeth; the Eternal, the Ancient, the Living
and Awful Being, the Searcher into concealed things, the Being that
never changeth." Idols and visible representations of the Deity were
originally forbidden, and He was directed to be worshipped in the lonely
solitude of sequestered forests, where He was said to dwell, invisible,
and in perfect silence.

The Druids, like their Eastern ancestors, paid the most sacred regard to
the odd numbers, which, traced backward, ended in Unity or Deity, while
the even numbers ended in nothing. 3 was particularly reverenced. 19
(7+3+3<sup>2</sup>): 30 (7×3+3×3): and 21 (7×3) were numbers observed in
the erection of their temples, constantly appearing in their dimensions,
and the number and distances of the huge stones.

They were the sole interpreters of religion. They superintended all
sacrifices; for no private person could offer one without their
permission. They exercised the power of excommunication; and without
their concurrence war could not be declared nor peace made: and they
even had the power of inflicting the punishment of death. They professed
to possess a knowledge of magic, and practised augury for the public
service.

They cultivated many of the liberal sciences, and particularly

<span id="page_619">p. 619</span>

astronomy, the favorite science of the Orient; in which they attained
considerable proficiency. They considered day as the off-spring of
night, and therefore made their computations by nights instead of days;
and we, from them, still use the words fortnight and sen’night. They
knew the division of the heavens into constellations; and finally, they
practised the strictest morality, having particularly the most sacred
regard for that peculiarly Masonic virtue, Truth.

In the Icelandic Prose Edda is the following dialogue:

"Who is the first or eldest of the Gods?

"In our language he is called ALFADIR (All-Father, or the Father of
All); but in the old Asgard he had twelve names.

"Where is this God? What is his power? and what hath he done to display
his glory?

"He liveth from all ages, he governeth all realms, and swayeth all
things both great and small.

"He hath formed Heaven and earth, and the air, and all things thereunto
belonging.

"He hath made man and given him a soul which shall live and never
perish, though the body shall have mouldered away or have been burnt to
ashes. And all that are righteous shall dwell with him in the place
called *Gimli* or *Vingolf*; but the wicked shall go to *Hel* and thence
to *Niflhel* which is below, in the ninth world."

Almost every heathen nation, so far as we have any knowledge of their
mythology, believed in one Supreme Overruling God, whose name it was not
lawful to utter.

"When we ascend," says Müller, to the most distant heights of Greek
history, the idea of God as the Supreme Being stands before us as a
simple fact. Next to this adoration of One God, the Father of Heaven,
the Father of men, we find in Greece a Worship of Nature." The original
Ζεὺς was the God or Gods, called by the Greeks the Son of Time, meaning
that there was no God before Him, but He was Eternal. "Zeus," says the
Orphic line, "is the Beginning, Zeus the Middle; out of Zeus all things
have been made." And the Peleides of Dodona said, "Zeus was, Zeus is.
Zeus will be; O great Zeus!" Ζεὺς νἦ, Ζεὺς ἐστὶν, Ζεὺς ἐσσεται· ὦ μελάλη
Ζεῦ: and he was Ζεὺς, κύδιστος, μέγιστος, Zeus, Best and Greatest.

<span id="page_620">p. 620</span>

The Parsees, retaining the old religion taught by Zaradisht, say in
their catechism: "We believe in only one God, and do not believe in any
beside Him; Who created the Heavens, the Earth, the Angels. . . . Our
God has neither face nor form, color nor shape, nor fixed place. There
is no other like Him, nor can our mind comprehend Him."

The Tetragrammaton, *or some other word covered by it*, was forbidden to
be pronounced. But that its pronunciation might not be lost among the
Levites, the High-Priest uttered it in the Temple once a year, on the
10th day of the Month Tisri, the day of the great feast of expiation.
During this ceremony, the people were directed to make a great noise,
that the Sacred Word might not be heard by any who had not a right to
it; for every other, said the Jews, would be incontinently stricken
dead.

The Great Egyptian Initiates, before the time of the Jews, did the same
thing in regard to the word Isis; which they regarded as sacred and
incommunicable.

Origen says: "There are names which have a natural potency. Such as
those which the Sages used among the Egyptians, the Magi in Persia, the
Brahmins in India. What is called Magic is not a vain and chimerical
act, as the Stoics and Epicureans pretend. The names SABAOTH and ADONAI
were not made for created beings; but they belong to a mysterious
theology, which goes back to the Creator. From Him comes the virtue of
these names, when they are arranged and pronounced according to the
rules."

The Hindu\_ word AUM represented the three Powers combined in their
Deity: Brahma, Vishnu, and Siva; or the Creating, Pre-serving, and
Destroying Powers: A, the first; U or O^-O^, the second; and M, the
third. This word could not be pronounced, except by the letters: for its
pronunciation as one word was said to make Earth tremble, and even the
Angels of Heaven to quake for fear.

The word AUM, says the Ramayan, represents "The Being of Beings, One
Substance in three forms; without mode, without quality, without
passion: Immense, Incomprehensible, Infinite, Indivisible, Immutable,
Incorporeal, Irresistible."

An old passage in the Purana says: "All the rites ordained in the Vedas,
the sacrifices to the fire, and all other solemn purifications, shall
pass away; but that which shall never pass away is

<span id="page_621">p. 621</span>

the word A∴O^-O^∴ M∴ for it is the symbol of the Lord of all things."

Herodotus says that the Ancient Pelasgi built no temples and worshipped
no idols, and had a sacred name of Deity, which it was not permissible
to pronounce.

The Clarian Oracle, which was of unknown antiquity, being asked which of
the Deities was named ΙΑΩ, answered in these remarkable words: "The
Initiated are bound to conceal the mysterious secrets. Learn, then, that
ΙΑΩis the Great God Supreme, that ruleth over all."

The Jews consider the True Name of God to be irrecoverably lost by
disuse, and regard its pronunciation as one of the Mysteries that will
be revealed at the coming of their Messiah. And they attribute its loss
to the illegality of applying the Masoretic points to so sacred a Name,
by which a knowledge of the proper vowels is forgotten. It is even said,
in the Gemara of Abodah Zara, that God permitted a celebrated Hebrew
Scholar to be burned by a Roman Emperor, because he had been heard to
pronounce the Sacred Name with points.

The Jews feared that the Heathen would get possession of the Name: and
therefore, in their copies of the Scriptures, they wrote it in the
Samaritan character, instead of the Hebrew or Chaldaic, that the
adversary might not make an improper use of it: for they believed it
capable of working miracles; and held that the wonders in Egypt were
performed by Moses, in virtue of this name being engraved on his rod:
and that any person who knew the true pronunciation would be able to do
as much as he did.

Josephus says it was unknown until God communicated it to Moses in the
wilderness: and that it was lost through the wickedness of man.

The followers of Mahomet have a tradition that there is a secret name of
the Deity which possesses wonderful properties; and that the only method
of becoming acquainted with it, is by being initiated into the Mysteries
of the *Ism Abla*.

H∴O∴M∴ was the first framer of the new religion among the Persians, and
His Name was Ineffable.

AMUN, among the Egyptians, was a name pronounceable by none save the
Priests.

The old Germans adored God with [profound](errata.htm#29.md) reverence,
without daring to name Him, or to worship Him in Temples.

<span id="page_622">p. 622</span>

The Druids expressed the name of Deity by the letters O∴I∴W∴

Among all the nations of primitive antiquity, the doctrine of the
immortality of the soul was not a mere probable hypothesis, needing
laborious researches and diffuse argumentation to produce conviction of
its truth. Nor can we hardly give it the name of *Faith*; for it was a
lively *certainty*, like the feeling of one's own existence and
identity, and of what is actually present; exerting its influence on all
sublunary affairs, and the motive of mightier deeds and enterprises than
any mere earthly interest could inspire.

Even the doctrine of transmigration of souls, universal among the
Ancient Hindu\_s and Egyptians, rested on a basis of the old primitive
religion, and was connected with a sentiment purely religious. It
involved this noble element of truth: That since man had gone astray,
and wandered far from God, he must needs make many efforts, and undergo
a long and painful pilgrimage, before he could rejoin the Source of all
Perfection: and the firm conviction and positive certainty, that nothing
defective, impure, or defiled with earthy stains, could enter the pure
region of perfect spirits, or be eternally united to God; wherefore the
soul had to pass through long trials and many purifications before it
could attain that blissful end. And the end and aim of all these systems
of philosophy was the final deliverance of the soul from the old
calamity, the dreaded fate and frightful lot of being compelled to
wander through the dark regions of nature and the various forms of the
brute creation, ever changing its terrestrial shape, and its union with
God, which they held to be the lofty destiny of the wise and virtuous
soul.

Pythagoras gave to the doctrine of the transmigration of souls that
meaning which the wise Egyptians gave to it in their Mysteries. He never
taught the doctrine in that literal sense in which it was understood by
the people. Of that literal doctrine not the least vestige is to be
found in such of his symbols as remain, nor in his precepts collected by
his disciple Lysias. He held that men always remain, in their essence,
such as they were created; and can degrade themselves only by vice, and
ennoble themselves only by virtue.

Hierocles, one of his most zealous and celebrated disciples, expressly
says that he who believes that the soul of man, after his death, will
enter the body of a beast, for his vices, or become a

<span id="page_623">p. 623</span>

plant for his stupidity, is deceived; and is absolutely ignorant of the
eternal form of the soul, which can never change; for, always remaining
man, it is said to become God or beast, through virtue or vice, though
it can become neither one nor the other by nature, but solely by
resemblance of its inclinations to theirs.

And Timæus of Locria, another disciple, says that to alarm men and
prevent them from committing crimes, they menaced them with strange
humiliations and punishments; even declaring that their souls would pass
into new bodies,--that of a coward into the body of a deer; that of a
ravisher into the body of a wolf; that of a murderer into the body of
some still more ferocious animal; and that of an impure sensualist into
the body of a hog.

So, too, the doctrine is explained in the Phædo. And Lysias days, that
after the soul, purified of its crimes, has left the body and returned
to Heaven, it is no longer subject to change or death, but enjoys an
eternal felicity. According to the Indians, it returned to, and became a
part of, the universal soul which animates everything.

The Hindu\_s held that Buddha descended on earth to raise all human
beings up to the perfect state. He will ultimately succeed, and all,
himself included, be merged in Unity.

Vishnu is to judge the world at the last day. It is to be consumed by
fire: The Sun and Moon are to lose their light; the Stars to fall; and a
New Heaven and Earth to be created.

The legend of the fall of the Spirits, obscured and distorted, is
preserved in the Hindu Mythology. And their traditions acknowledged, and
they revered, the succession of the first ancestors of mankind, or the
Holy Patriarchs of the primitive world, under the name of the Seven
Great RISHIS, or Sages of hoary antiquity; though they invested their
history with a cloud of fictions.

The Egyptians held that the soul was immortal; and that Osiris was to
judge the world.

And thus reads the Persian legend:

"After Ahriman shall have ruled the world until the end of time,
SOSIOSCH, the promised Redeemer, will come and annihilate the power of
the DEVS (or Evil Spirits), awaken the dead, and sit in final judgment
upon spirits and men. After that the comet *Gurzsher* will be thrown
down, and a general conflagration take place, which will consume the
whole world. The remains of the

<span id="page_624">p. 624</span>

earth will then sink down into *Duzakh*, and become for three periods a
place of punishment for the wicked. Then, by degrees, all will be
pardoned, even *Ahriman* and the *Devs*, and admitted to the regions of
bliss, and thus there will be a new Heaven and a new earth."

In the doctrines of Lamaism also, we find, obscured, and partly
concealed in fiction, fragments of the primitive truth. For, according
to that faith, "There is to be a final judgment before ESLIK KHAN: The
good are to be admitted to Paradise, the bad to be banished to hell,
where there are eight regions burning hot and eight freezing cold."

In the Mysteries, wherever they were practised, was taught that truth of
the primitive revelation, the existence of One Great Being, Infinite and
pervading the Universe, Who was there worshipped without superstition;
and His marvellous nature, essence, and attributes taught to the
Initiates; while the vulgar attributed His works to Secondary Gods,
personified, and isolated from Him in fabulous independence.

These truths were covered from the common people as with a veil; and the
Mysteries were carried into every country, that, without disturbing the
popular beliefs, truth, the arts, and the sciences might be known to
those who were capable of understanding them, and maintaining the true
doctrine incorrupt; which the people, prone to superstition and
idolatry, have in no age been able to do; nor, as many strange
aberrations and superstitions of the present day prove, any more now
than heretofore. For we need but point to the doctrines of so many sects
that degrade the Creator to the rank, and assign to Him the passions of
humanity, to prove that now, as always, the old truths must be committed
to a few, or they will be overlaid with fiction and error, and
irretrievably lost.

Though Masonry is identical with the Ancient Mysteries, it is so in this
qualified sense; that it presents but an imperfect image of their
brilliancy; the ruins only of their grandeur, and a system that has
experienced progressive alterations, the fruits of social events and
political circumstances. Upon leaving Egypt, the Mysteries were modified
by the habits of the different nations among whom they were introduced.
Though originally more moral and political than religious, they soon
became the heritage, as it were, of the priests, and essentially
religious, though in reality

<span id="page_625">p. 625</span>

limiting the sacerdotal power, by teaching the intelligent laity the
folly and absurdity of the creeds of the populace. They were therefore
necessarily changed by the religious systems of the countries into which
they were transplanted. In Greece, they were the Mysteries of Ceres; in
Rome, of *Bona Dea*, the Good Goddess; in Gaul, the School of Mars; in
Sicily, the Academy of the Sciences; among the Hebrews, they partook of
the rites and ceremonies of a religion which placed all the powers of
government, and all the knowledge, in the hands of the Priests and
Levites. The pagodas of India, the retreats of the Magi of Persia and
Chaldea, and the pyramids of Egypt, were no longer the sources at which
men drank in knowledge. Each people, at all informed, had its Mysteries.
After a time the Temples of Greece and the School of Pythagoras lost
their reputation, and Freemasonry took their place.

Masonry, when properly expounded, is at once the interpretation of the
great book of nature, the recital of physical and astronomical
phenomena, the purest philosophy, and the place of deposit, where, as in
a Treasury, are kept in safety all the great truths of the primitive
revelation, that form the basis of all religions. In the modern Degrees
three things are to be recognized: The image of primeval times, the
tableau of the efficient causes of the Universe, and the book in which
are written the morality of all peoples, and the code by which they must
govern themselves if they would be prosperous.

The Kabalistic doctrine was long the religion of the Sage and the
Savant; because, like Freemasonry, it incessantly tends toward spiritual
perfection, and the fusion of the creeds and Nationalities of Mankind.
In the eyes of the Kabalist, all men are his brothers; and their
relative ignorance is, to him, but a reason for instructing them. There
were illustrious Kabalists among the Egyptians and Greeks, whose
doctrines the Orthodox Church has accepted; and among the Arabs were
many, whose wisdom was not slighted by the Mediæval Church.

The Sages proudly wore the name of Kabalists. The Kabalah embodied a
noble philosophy, pure, not mysterious, but symbolic. It taught the
doctrine of the Unity of God, the art of knowing and explaining the
essence and operations of the Supreme Being, of spiritual powers and
natural forces, and of determining their action by symbolic figures; by
the arrangement of the alphabet,

<span id="page_626">p. 626</span>

the combinations of numbers, the inversion of letters in writing and the
concealed meanings which they claimed to discover therein. The Kabalah
is the key of the occult sciences; and the Gnostics were born of the
Kabalists.

The science of numbers represented not only arithmetical qualities, but
also all grandeur, all proportion. By it we necessarily arrive at the
discovery of the Principle or First Cause of things, called at the
present day THE ABSOLUTE.

Or UNITY,--that loftiest term to which all philosophy directs itself;
that imperious necessity of the human mind, that pivot round which it is
compelled to group the aggregate of its ideas: Unity, this source, this
centre of all systematic order, this principle of existence, this
central point, unknown in its essence, but manifest in its effects;
Unity, that sublime centre to which the chain of causes necessarily
ascends, was the august Idea toward which all the ideas of Pythagoras
converged. He refused the title of *Sage*, which means *one who knows*.
He invented, and applied to himself that of *Philosopher*, signifying
one who *is fond of* or *studies things secret and occult*. The
astronomy which he mysteriously taught, was *astrology*: his science of
numbers was based on Kabalistical principles.

The Ancients, and Pythagoras himself, whose real principles have not
been always understood, never meant to ascribe to numbers, that is to
say, to abstract signs, any special virtue. But the Sages of Antiquity
concurred in recognizing a ONE FIRST CAUSE (material or spiritual) of
the existence of the Universe. Thence, UNITY became the symbol of the
Supreme Deity. It was made to express, to represent God; but without
attributing to the mere, *number* ONE any divine or supernatural virtue.

The Pythagorean ideas as to particular numbers are partially expressed
in the following

\[The Rabbi (President of the Sanhedrin) adds: From all that you have
said, it results that the unit develops itself in 2, is completed in
three internally, and so produces 4 externally; whence, through 6, 7, 8,
9, it arrives at 5, half of the spherical number 10, to ascend, passing
through 11, to 12, and to raise itself, by the number 4 times 10, to the
number 6 times 12, the final term and summit of our eternal happiness.\]

*Qu*∴ What is the generative number?

*Ans*∴ In the Divinity, it is the unit; in created things, the number 2:
Because the Divinity, 1, engenders 2, and in created things 2 engenders
1.

*Qu*∴ What is the most majestic number?

*Ans*∴ 3, because it denotes the triple divine essence.

*Qu*∴ What is the most mysterious number?

*Ans*∴ 6, because it contains the source of our spiritual and corporeal
happiness.

*Qu*∴ What is the most fortunate number?

*Ans*∴ 7, because it leads us to the decade, the perfect number.

*Qu*∴ Which is the number most to be desired?

Sages.

*Qu*∴ Which is the most sublime number?

*Ans*∴ 9, because by it religion and nature are exalted.

*Qu*∴ Which is the most perfect number?

*Ans*∴ 10, because it includes unity, which created everything, and
zero, symbol of matter and chaos, whence everything emerged.

<span id="page_629">p. 629</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> In its figures it
comprehends the created and uncreated, the commencement and the end,
power and force, life and annihilation. By the study of this number, we
find the relations of all things; the power of the Creator, the
faculties of the creature, the Alpha and Omega of divine knowledge.

*Qu*∴ Which is the most multiplying number?

*Ans*∴ 11, because with the possession of two units, we arrive at the
multiplication of things.

*Qu*∴ Which is the most solid number?

*Ans*∴ 12, because it is the foundation of our spiritual and temporal
happiness.

*Qu*∴ Which is the favorite number of religion and nature?

*Ans*∴ 4 times 10, because it enables us, rejecting everything impure,
eternally to enjoy the number 6 times 12, term and summit of our
felicity.

*Qu*∴ What is the meaning of the square?

*Ans*∴ It is the symbol of the four elements contained in the triangle,
or the emblem of the three chemical principles: these things united form
absolute unity in the primal matter.

*Qu*∴ What is the meaning of the centre of the circumference?

*Ans*∴ It signifies the universal spirit, vivifying centre of nature.

*Qu*∴ What do you mean by the quadrature of the circle?

*Ans*∴ The investigation of the quadrature of the circle indicates the
knowledge of the four vulgar elements, which are themselves composed of
elementary spirits or chief principles; as the circle, though round, is
composed of lines, which escape the sight, and are seen only by the
mind.

*Qu*∴ What is the profoundest meaning of the figure 3?

*Ans*∴ The Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. From the action of
these three results the triangle within the square; and from the seven
angles, the decade or perfect number.

*Qu*∴ Which is the most confused figure?

*Ans*∴ Zero,--the emblem of chaos, formless mixture of the elements.

*Qu*∴ What do the four devices of the Degree signify?

*Ans*∴ That we are to hear, see, be silent, and enjoy our happiness.

The *unit* is the symbol of identity, equality, existence, conservation,
and general harmony; the Central Fire, the Point within the Circle.

<span id="page_630">p. 630</span>

*Two*, or the *duad*, is the symbol of diversity, inequality, division,
separation, and vicissitudes.

The figure 1 signifies the living man \[a body standing upright\]; man
being the only living being possessed of this faculty. Adding to it a
head, we have the letter P, the sign of Paternity, Creative

Power; and with a further addition, R, signifying man in motion, going,
*Iens*, *Iturus*.

The Duad is the origin of contrasts. It is the imperfect condition into
which, according to the Pythagoreans, a being falls, when he detaches
himself from the Monad, or God. Spiritual beings,

emanating from God, are enveloped in the duad, and therefore receive
only illusory impressions.

As formerly the number ONE designated harmony, order, or the Good
Principle (the ONE and ONLY GOD, expressed in Latin by *Solus*, whence
the words *Sol*, *Soleil*, symbol of this God), the number Two expressed
the contrary idea. There commenced the fatal knowledge of good and evil.
Everything double, false, opposed to the single and sole reality, was
expressed by the Binary number. It expressed also that state of
contrariety in which nature exists, where everything is double; night
and day, light and darkness, cold and heat, wet and dry, health and
sickness, error and truth, one and the other sex, etc. Hence the Romans
dedicated the second month in the year to Pluto, the God of Hell, and
the second day of that month to the *manès* of the dead.

The number *One*, with the Chinese, signified unity, harmony, order, the
Good Principle, or God; *Two*, disorder, duplicity, false-hood. That
people, in the earliest ages, based their whole philosophical system on
the two primary figures or lines, one straight and unbroken, and the
other broken or divided into two; doubling which, by placing one under
the other, and trebling by placing three under each other, they made the
four symbols and eight *Koua*; which referred to the natural elements,
and the primary principles of all things, and served symbolically or
scientifically to express them. Plato terms unity and duality the
original elements of nature, and first principles of all existence: and
the oldest sacred book of the Chinese says: "The Great First Principle
has produced two equations and differences, or primary rules of
existence; but the two primary rules or two oppositions, namely YN and
YANG, or repose and motion, have produced four signs or

<span id="page_631">p. 631</span>

symbols, and the four symbols have produced the eight KOUA or further
combinations."

The interpretation of the Hermetic fables shows, among every ancient
people, in their principal gods, first, 1, the Creating Monad, then 3,
then 3 times 3, 3 times 9, and 3 times 27. This triple progression has
for its foundation the three ages of Nature, the Past, the Present, and
the Future; or the three degrees of universal generation. . . Birth,
Life, Death... Beginning, middle, end.

The Monad was male, because its action produces no change in itself, but
only *out* of itself. It represented the creative principle.

The Duad, for a contrary reason, was female, ever changing by addition,
subtraction, or multiplication. It represents matter capable of form.

The union of the Monad and Duad produces the Triad, signifying the world
formed by the creative principle out of matter. Pythagoras represented
the world by the right-angled triangle, in which the squares of the two
shortest sides are equal, added together, to the square of the longest
one; as the world, as formed, is equal to the creative cause, and matter
clothed with form.

The ternary is the first of the unequal numbers. The Triad, mysterious
number, which plays so great a part in the traditions of Asia and the
philosophy of Plato, image of the Supreme Being, includes in itself the
properties of the first two numbers. It was, to the Philosophers, the
most excellent and favorite number: a mysterious type, revered by all
antiquity, and consecrated in the Mysteries; wherefore there are but
three essential Degrees among Masons; who venerate, in the triangle, the
most august mystery, that of the Sacred Triad, object of their homage
and study.

In geometry, a line cannot represent a body absolutely perfect. As
little do two lines constitute a figure demonstratively perfect. But
three lines form, by their junction, the TRIANGLE, or the first figure
regularly perfect; and this is why it has served and still serves to
characterize The Eternal; Who, infinitely perfect in His nature, is, as
Universal Creator, the first Being, and consequently the first
Perfection.

The Quadrangle or Square, perfect as it appears, being but the second
perfection, can in no wise represent God; Who is the first. It is to be
noted that the name of God in Latin and French (Deus, Dieu), has for its
initial the Delta or Greek Triangle. Such is the reason, among ancients
and moderns, for the consecration

<span id="page_632">p. 632</span>

of the Triangle, whose three sides are emblems of the three Kingdoms, or
Nature, or God. In the centre is the Hebrew JOD (initial of ‏ו
?Y?H?W?H‎), the Animating Spirit of Fire, the generative principle,
represented by the letter G., initial of the name of Deity in the
languages of the North, and the meaning whereof is Generation.

The first side of the Triangle, offered to the study of the Apprentice,
is the mineral kingdom, symbolized by Tub∴

The second side, the subject of the meditations of the Fellow Craft, is
the vegetable kingdom, symbolized by Schib∴ (an ear of corn). In this
reign begins the Generation of bodies; and this is why the letter G., in
its radiance, is presented to the eyes of the adept.

The third side, the study whereof is devoted to the animal kingdom, and
completes the instruction of the Master, is symbolized by Mach∴ (Son of
putrefaction).

The figure 3 symbolizes the Earth. It is a figure of the terrestrial
bodies. The 2, upper half of 3, symbolizes the vegetable world, the
lower half being hidden from our sight.

Three also referred to harmony, friendship, peace, concord, and
temperance; and was so highly esteemed among the Pythagoreans that they
called it perfect harmony.

Three, four, ten, and twelve were sacred numbers among the Etrurians, as
they were among the Jews, Egyptians, and Hindu\_s.

The name of Deity, in many Nations, consisted of three letters: among
the Greeks, Ι∴Α∴ Ω∴; among the Persians, H∴O∴M∴; among the Hindu\_s,
AUM; among the Scandinavians, I∴O∴W∴. On the upright Tablet of the King,
discovered at Nimroud, no less than five of the thirteen names of the
Great Gods consist of three letters each,--ANU, SAN, YAV, BAR, and BEL.

The quaternary is the most perfect number, and the root of other
numbers, and of all things. The tetrad expresses the first mathematical
power. Four represents also the generative power, from which all
combinations are derived. The Initiates considered it the emblem of
Movement and the Infinite, representing everything that is neither
corporeal nor sensible. Pythagoras communicated it to his disciples as a
symbol of the Eternal and Creative Principle, under the name of
Quaternary, the Ineffable Name of God, which signifies Source of
everything that has received existence; and which, in Hebrew, is
composed of four letters.

<span id="page_633">p. 633</span>

In the Quaternary we find the first solid figure, the universal symbol
of immortality, the pyramid. The Gnostics claimed that the whole edifice
of their science rested on a square whose angles were . . . Σιγή,
*Silence*: Βυθος *Profundity*: Νοος, *Intelligence*: and Αληθεια,
*Truth*. For if the Triangle, figured by the number 3, forms the
triangular base of the pyramid, it is unity which forms its point or
summit.

Lysias and Timæus of Locria said that not a single thing could be named,
which did not depend on the quaternary as its root.

There is, according to the Pythagoreans, a connection between the gods
and numbers, which constitutes the kind of Divination called
Arithmomancy. The soul is a number: it is moved of itself: it contains
in itself the quaternary number.

Matter being represented by the number 9, or 3 times 3, and the Immortal
Spirit having for its essential hieroglyphic the quaternary or the
number 4, the Sages said that Man, having gone astray and become
entangled in an inextricable labyrinth, in going from *four* to *nine*,
the only way which he could take to emerge from these deceitful paths,
these disastrous detours, and the abyss of evil into which he had
plunged, was to retrace his steps, and go from *nine* to *four*.

The ingenious and mystical idea which caused the Triangle to be
venerated, was applied to the figure 4 (4). It was said that it
expressed a living being, I, bearer of the Triangle △, the emblem of
God; *i.e.*, man bearing with himself a Divine principle.

Four was a divine number; it referred to the Deity, and many Ancient
Nations gave God a name of four letters; as the Hebrews ‏ו ?Y?H?W?H‎,
the Egyptians AMUN, the Persians SURA, the Greeks ΘΕΟΣ, and the Latins
DEUS. This was the Tetragrammaton of the Hebrews, and the Pythagoreans
called it Tetractys, and swore their most solemn oath by it. So too ODIN
among the Scandinavians, ΖΕΥΣ among the Greeks, PHTA among the
Egyptians, THOTH among the Phœnicians, and AS-UR and NEBO among the
Assyrians. The list might be indefinitely extended.

The number 5 was considered as mysterious, because it was compounded of
the Binary, Symbol of the False and Double, and the Ternary, so
interesting in its results. It thus energetically expresses the state of
imperfection, of order and disorder, of happiness and misfortune, of
life and death, which we see upon the earth. To the Mysterious Societies
it offered the fearful image of

<span id="page_634">p. 634</span>

the Bad Principle, bringing trouble into the inferior order,--in a word,
the Binary acting in the Ternary.

Under another aspect it was the emblem of marriage; because it is
composed of 2, the first equal number, and of 3, the first unequal
number. Wherefore Juno, the Goddess of Marriage, had for her
hieroglyphic the number 5.

Moreover, it has one of the properties of the number 9, that of
reproducing itself, when multiplied by itself: there being always a 5 on
the right hand of the product; a result which led to its use as a symbol
of material changes.

The ancients represented the world by the number 5. A reason for it,
given by Diodorus, is, that it represents earth, water, air, fire, and
ether or spirit. Thence the origin of πεντε (5) and Παν the Universe, as
the whole.

The number 5 designated the universal quintessence, and symbolized, by
its form ς, the vital essence, the animating spirit, which flows
\[*serpentat*\] through all nature. In fact, this ingenious figure is
the union of the two Greek accents ‘ ’, placed over those vowels which
ought to be or ought not to be aspirated. The first sign ‘ bears the
name of potent spirit; and signifies the Superior Spirit, the Spirit of
God aspirated (*spiratus*), respired by man. The second sign ’ is styled
mild spirit, and represents the secondary spirit, the spirit purely
human.

The triple triangle, a figure of five lines uniting in five points, was
among the Pythagoreans an emblem of Health.

It is the Pentalpha of Pythagoras, or Pentangle of Solomon; has five
lines and five angles; and is, among Masons, the outline or origin of
the five-pointed Star, and an emblem of Fellowship.

The number 6 was, in the Ancient Mysteries, a striking emblem of nature;
as presenting the six dimensions of all bodies; the six lines which make
up their form, viz., the four lines of direction, toward the North,
South, East, and West; with the two lines of height and depth,
responding to the zenith and nadir. The sages applied the senary to the
physical man; while the septenary was, for them, the symbol of his
immortal spirit.

The hieroglyphical senary (the double equilateral triangle) is the
symbol of Deity.

Six is also an emblem of health, and the symbol of justice; because it
is the first perfect number; that is, the first whose aliquot parts
(1/2, 1/3, 1/6, or 3, 2, and 1), added together, make itself.

<span id="page_635">p. 635</span>

Ormuzd created six good spirits, and Ahriman six evil ones. These typify
the six Summer and the six Winter months.

No number has ever been so universally in repute as the septenary. Its
celebrity is due, no doubt, to the planets being seven in number. It
belongs also to sacred things. The Pythagoreans regarded it as formed of
the numbers 3 and 4; the first whereof was, in their eyes, the image of
the three material elements, and the second the principle of everything
that is neither corporeal nor sensible. It presented them, from that
point of view, the emblem of everything that is perfect.

Considered as composed of 6 and unity, it serves to designate the
invisible centre or soul of everything; because no body exists, of which
six lines do not constitute the form, nor without a seventh interior
point, as the centre and reality of the body, whereof the external
dimensions give only the appearance.

The numerous applications of the septenary confirmed the ancient sages
in the use of this symbol. Moreover, they exalted the properties of the
number 7, as having, in a subordinate manner, the perfection of the
unit: for if the unit is untreated, if no number produces it, the seven
is also not engendered by any number contained in the interval between 1
and 10. The number 4 occupies an arithmetical middle-ground between the
unit and 7, inasmuch as it is as much over 1, as it is under 7, the
difference each way being 3.

The number 7, among the Egyptians, symbolized life; and this is why the
letter Ζ of the Greeks was the initial of the verb Ζάω, I live; and Ζεὺς
(Jupiter), Father of Life.

The number 8, or the octary, is composed of the sacred numbers 3 and 5.
Of the heavens, of the seven planets, and of the sphere of the fixed
stars, or of the eternal unity and the mysterious number 7, is composed
the ogdoade, the number 8, the first cube of equal numbers, regarded as
sacred in the arithmetical philosophy.

The Gnostic ogdoade had eight stars, which represented the eight Cabiri
of Samothrace, the eight Egyptian and Phœnician principles, the eight
gods of Xenocrates, the eight angles of the cubic stone.

The number eight symbolizes perfection: and its figure, 8 or ∞ indicates
the perpetual and regular course of the Universe.

It is the first cube (2 × 2 × 2), and signifies friendship, prudence,

<span id="page_636">p. 636</span>

counsel, and justice. It was a symbol of the primeval law which regarded
all men as equal.

The novary, or triple ternary. If the number three was celebrated among
the ancient sages, that of three times three had no less celebrity;
because, according to them, each of the three elements which constitute
our bodies is ternary: the water containing earth and fire; the earth
containing igneous and aqueous particles; and the fire being tempered by
globules of water and terrestrial corpuscles which serve to feed it. No
one of the three elements being entirely separated from the others, all
material beings composed of these three elements, whereof each is
triple, may be designated by the figurative number of three times three,
which has become the symbol of all formations of bodies. Hence the name
of ninth envelope, given to matter. Every material extension, every
circular line, has for representative sign the number nine, among the
Pythagoreans; who had observed the property which this number possesses,
of reproducing itself incessantly and entire, in every multiplication;
thus offering to the mind a very striking emblem of matter which is
incessantly composed before our eyes, after having undergone a thousand
decompositions.

The number nine was consecrated to the Spheres and the Muses. It is the
sign of every circumference; because a circle of 360 degrees is equal to
9, that is to say, 3 + 6 + 0 = 9. Nevertheless, the ancients regarded
this number with a sort of terror: they considered it a bad presage; as
the symbol of versatility, of change, and the emblem of the frailty of
human affairs. Wherefore they avoided all numbers where nine appears,
and chiefly 81, the product of 9 multiplied by itself, and the addition
whereof, 8 + 1, again presents the number 9.

As the figure of the number 6 was the symbol of the terrestrial globe,
animated by a divine spirit, the figure of the number 9 symbolized the
earth, under the influence of the Evil Principle; and thence the terror
it inspired. Nevertheless, according to the Kabalists, the figure 9
symbolizes the generative egg, or the image of a little globular being,
from whose lower side seems to flow its spirit of life.

The Ennead, signifying an aggregate of 9 things or persons, is the first
square of unequal numbers.

Every one is aware of the singular properties of the number 9,

<span id="page_637">p. 637</span>

which, multiplied by itself or any other number whatever, gives a result
whose final sum is always 9, or always divisible by 9.

Nine, multiplied by each of the ordinary numbers, produces an
arithmetical progression, each member whereof, composed of two figures,
presents a remarkable fact; for example:

<div align="center">

|     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   | 6   | 7   | 8   | 9   | 10  |
| 9   | 18  | 27  | 36  | 45  | 54  | 63  | 72  | 81  | 90  |

</div>

The first line of figures gives the regular series, from 1 to 10. The
second reproduces this line doubly; first ascending, from the first
figure of 18, and then returning from the second figure of 81.

It follows, from the curious fact, that the half of the numbers which
compose this progression represents, in inverse order, the figures of
the second half:

<span id="img_63700"></span> ![](img/63700.jpg)

<span id="page_638">p. 638</span>

<span id="img_63800"></span> ![](img/63800.jpg)

The number 10, or the Denary, is the measure of everything; and reduces
multiplied numbers to unity. Containing all the numerical and harmonic
relations, and all the properties of the numbers which precede it, it
concludes the Abacus or Table of Pythagoras. To the Mysterious
Societies, this number typified the assemblage of all the wonders of the
Universe. They wrote it thus θ, that is to say, Unity in the middle of
Zero, as the centre of a circle, or symbol of Deity. They saw in this
figure everything that should lead to reflection: the centre, the ray,
and the circumference, represented to them God, Man, and the Universe.

This number was, among the Sages, a sign of concord, love, and peace. To
Masons it is a sign of union and good faith; because it is expressed by
joining two hands, or the Master's grip, when the number of fingers
gives 10: and it was represented by the Tetractys of Pythagoras.

The number 12, like the number 7, is celebrated in the worship of
nature. The two most famous divisions of the heavens, that by 7, which
is that of the planets, and that by 12, which is that of the Signs of
the Zodiac, are found upon the religious monuments of all the peoples of
the Ancient World, even to the remote extremes of the East. Although
Pythagoras does not speak of the number 12, it is none the less a sacred
number. It is the image of the Zodiac; and consequently that of the Sun,
which rules over it.

Such are the ancient ideas in regard to those numbers which so often
appear in Masonry; and rightly understood, as the old Sages understood
them, they contain many a pregnant lesson.

Before we enter upon the final lesson of Masonic Philosophy, we will
delay a few moments to repeat to you the Christian interpretations of
the Blue Degrees.

<span id="page_639">p. 639</span>

In the First Degree, they said, there are three symbols to be applied.

1st. Man, after the fall, was left naked and defenceless against the
just anger of the Deity. Prone to evil, the human race staggered blindly
onward into the thick darkness of unbelief, bound fast by the strong
cable-tow of the natural and sinful will. Moral corruption was followed
by physical misery. Want and destitution invaded the earth. War and
Famine and Pestilence filled up the measure of evil, and over the sharp
flints of misfortune and wretchedness man toiled with naked and bleeding
feet. This condition of blindness, destitution, misery, and bondage,
from which to save the world the Redeemer came, is symbolized by the
condition of the candidate, when he is brought up for the first time to
the door of the Lodge.

2d. Notwithstanding the death of the Redeemer, man can be saved only by
faith, repentance, and reformation. To repent, he must feel the sharp
sting of conscience and remorse, like a sword piercing his bosom. His
confidence in his guide, whom he is told to follow and fear no danger;
his trust in God, which he is caused to profess; and the point of the
sword that is pressed against his naked left breast over the heart, are
symbolical of the faith, repentance and reformation necessary to bring
him to the light of a life in Christ the Crucified.

3d. Having repented and reformed, and bound himself to the service of
God by a firm promise and obligation, the light of Christian hope shines
down into the darkness of the heart of the humble penitent, and blazes
upon his pathway to Heaven. And this is symbolized by the candidate's
being brought to light, after he is obligated, by the Worshipful Master,
who in that is a symbol of the Redeemer, and so brings him to light,
with the help of the brethren, as He taught the Word with the aid of the
Apostles.

In the Second Degree there are two symbols:

4th. The Christian assumes new duties toward God and his fellows. Toward
God, of love, gratitude, and veneration, and an anxious desire to serve
and glorify Him; toward his fellows, of kindness, sympathy, and justice.
And this assumption of duty, this entering upon good works, is
symbolized by the Fellow-Craft's obligation; by which, bound as an
apprentice to secrecy merely, and set in the Northeast corner of the
Lodge, he descends

<span id="page_640">p. 640</span>

as a Fellow-Craft into the body of the brethren, and assumes the active
duties of a good Mason.

5th. The Christian, reconciled to God, sees the world in a new light.
This great Universe is no longer a mere machine, wound up and set going
six thousand or sixty millions years ago, and left to run on afterward
forever, by virtue of a law of mechanics created at the beginning,
without further care or consideration on the part of the Deity; but it
has now become to him a great emanation from God, the product of His
thought, not a mere dead machine, but a thing of life, over which God
watches continually, and every movement of which is immediately produced
by His present action, the law of harmony being the essence of the
Deity, re-enacted every instant. And this is symbolized by the imperfect
instruction given in the Fellow-Craft's Degree, in the sciences, and
particularly geometry, connected as the latter is with God Himself in
the mind of a Mason, because the same letter, suspended in the East,
represents both; and astronomy, or the knowledge of the laws of motion
and harmony that govern the spheres, is but a portion of the wider
science of geometry. It is so symbolized, because it is here, in the
Second Degree, that the candidate first receives an other than moral
instruction.

There are also two symbols in the Third Degree, which, with the 3 in the
first, and 2 in the second, make the 7.

6th. The candidate, after passing through the first part of the
ceremony, imagines himself a Master; and is surprised to be informed
that as yet he is not, and that it is uncertain whether he ever will be.
He is told of a difficult and dangerous path yet to be travelled, and is
advised that upon that journey it depends whether he will become a
Master. This is symbolical of that which our Saviour said to Nicodemus,
that, notwithstanding his morals might be beyond reproach, he could not
enter the Kingdom of Heaven unless he were born again; symbolically
dying, and again entering the world regenerate, like a spotless infant.

7th. The murder of Hiram, his burial, and his being raised again by the
Master, are symbols, both of the death, burial, and resurrection of the
Redeemer; and of the death and burial in sins of the natural man, and
his being raised again to a new life, or born again, by the direct
action of the Redeemer; after Morality (symbolized by the Entered
Apprentice's grip), and Philosophy (symbolized by the grip of the
Fellow-Craft), had failed to raise

<span id="page_641">p. 641</span>

him. That of the Lion of the House of Judah is the strong grip, never to
be broken, with which Christ, of the royal line of that House, has
clasped to Himself the whole human race, and embraces them in His wide
arms as closely and affectionately as brethren embrace each other on the
five points of fellowship.

As Entered Apprentices and Fellow-Crafts, Masons are taught to imitate
the laudable example of those Masons who labored at the building of King
Solomon's Temple; and to plant firmly and deep in their hearts those
foundation-stones of principle, truth, justice, temperance, fortitude,
prudence, and charity, on which to erect that Christian character which
all the storms of misfortune and all the powers and temptations of Hell
shall not prevail against; those feelings and noble affections which are
the most proper homage that can be paid to the Grand Architect and Great
Father of the Universe, and which make the heart a living temple builded
to Him: when the unruly passions are made to submit to rule and
measurement, and their excesses are struck off with the gavel of
self-restraint; and when every action and every principle is accurately
corrected and adjusted by the square of wisdom, the level of humility,
and the plumb of justice.

The two columns, Jachin and Boaz, are the symbols of that profound faith
and implicit trust in God and the Redeemer that are the Christian's
*strength*; and of those good works by which alone that faith can be
*established* and made operative and effectual to salvation.

The three pillars that support the Lodge are symbols of a Christian's
HOPE; in a future state of happiness; FAITH in the promises and the
divine character and mission of the Redeemer; and CHARITABLE JUDGMENT of
other men.

The three murderers of Khir-Om symbolize Pontius Pilate, Caiaphas the
High-Priest, and Judas Iscariot: and the three blows given him are the
betrayal by the last, the refusal of Roman protection by Pilate, and the
condemnation by the High-Priest. They also symbolize the blow on the
ear, the scourging, and the crown of thorns. The twelve fellow-crafts
sent in search of the body are the twelve disciples, in doubt whether to
believe that the Redeemer would rise from the dead.

The Master's word, supposed to be lost, symbolizes the Christian faith
and religion, supposed to have been crushed and destroyed when the
Saviour was crucified, after Iscariot had betrayed Him,

<span id="page_642">p. 642</span>

and Peter deserted Him, and when the other disciples doubted whether He
would arise from the dead; but which rose from His tomb and flowed
rapidly over the civilized world; and so that which was supposed to be
*lost* was *found*. It symbolizes also the Saviour Himself; the WORD
that was in the beginning--that was *with* God, and that *was* God; the
Word of life, that was made flesh and dwelt among us, and was supposed
to be lost, while He lay in the tomb, for three days, and His disciples
"as yet knew not the scripture that He must rise again from the dead,"
and doubted when they heard of it, and were amazed and frightened and
still doubted when He appeared among them.

The bush of acacia placed at the head of the grave of Khir-Om is an
emblem of resurrection and immortality.

Such are the explanations of our Christian brethren; entitled, like
those of all other Masons, to a respectful 'consideration.

#### CLOSING INSTRUCTION.

There is no pretence to infallibility in Masonry. It is not for us to
dictate to any man what he shall believe. We have hitherto, in the
instruction of the several Degrees, confined ourselves to laying before
you the great thoughts that have found expression in the different ages
of the world, leaving you to decide for yourself as to the orthodoxy or
heterodoxy of each, and what proportion of truth, if any, each
contained. We shall pursue no other course in this closing Philosophical
instruction; in which we propose to deal with the highest questions that
have ever exercised the human mind, with the existence and the nature of
a God, with the existence and the nature of the human soul, and with the
relations of the divine and human spirit with the merely material
Universe. There can be no questions more important to an intelligent
being, none that have for him a more direct and personal interest; and
to this last word of Scottish Masonry we invite your serious and
attentive consideration. And, as what we shall now say will be but the
completion and rounding-off of what we have already said in several of
the preceding Degrees, in regard to the Old Thought and the Ancient
Philosophies, we hope that you have noted and not forgotten our previous
lessons, without which this would seem imperfect and fragmentary.

In its idea of rewarding a faithful and intelligent workman by
conferring upon him a knowledge of the True Word, Masonry

<span id="page_643">p. 643</span>

has perpetuated a very great truth, because it involves the proposition
that the idea which a man forms of God is always the most important
element in his speculative theory of the Universe, and in his particular
practical plan of action for the Church, the State, the Community, the
Family, and his own individual life. It will ever make a vast difference
in the conduct of a people in war or peace, whether they believe the
Supreme God to be a cruel Deity, delighting in sacrifice and blood, or a
God of Love; and an individual's speculative theory as to the mode and
extent of God's government, and as to the nature and reality of his own
free-will and consequent responsibility, will needs have great influence
in shaping the course of his life and conversation.

We see every day the vast influence of the popular idea of God. All the
great historical civilizations of the race have grown out of the
national ideas which were formed of God; or have been intimately
connected with those ideas. The popular Theology, which at first is only
an abstract idea in the heads of philosophers, by and by shows itself in
the laws, and in the punishments for crime, in the churches, the
ceremonies and the sacraments, the festivals and the fasts, the
weddings, the baptisms and the funerals, in the hospitals, the colleges,
the schools, and all the social charities, in the relations of husband
and wife, parent and child, in the daily work and the daily prayer of
every man.

As the world grows in its development, it necessarily *out*grows its
ancient ideas of God, which were only temporary and pro-visional. A man
who has a higher conception of God than those about him, and who denies
that their conception *is* God, is very likely to be called an Atheist
by men who are really far less believers in a God than he. Thus the
Christians, who said the Heathen idols were no Gods, were accounted
Atheists by the People, and accordingly put to death; and Jesus of
Nazareth was crucified as an unbelieving blasphemer, by the Jews.

There is a mere formal Atheism, which is a denial of God in *terms*, but
not in *reality*. A man says, There is no God; that is, no God that is
self-originated, or that never originated, but always WAS and HAD BEEN,
who is the cause of existence, who is the Mind and the Providence of the
Universe; and so the order, beauty, and harmony of the world of matter
and mind do not indicate any plan or purpose of Deity. But, he says,
NATURE,--meaning by that the whole sum-total of existence,--*that* is
powerful,

<span id="page_644">p. 644</span>

active, wise, and good; *Nature* is self-originated, or always was and
had been, the cause of its own existence, the mind of the Universe and
the Providence of itself. There is obviously a plan and purpose whereby
order, beauty, and harmony are brought about; but all that is the plan
and purpose of nature.

In such cases, the absolute denial of God is only formal and not real.
The *qualities* of God are admitted, and affirmed to be real; and it is
a mere change of name to call the possessor of those qualities,
*Nature*, and not *God*. The real question is, whether such Qualities
exist, as we call God; and not, by what particular name we shall
designate the Qualities. One man may call the sum total of these
Qualities, Nature; another, Heaven; a third, Universe, a fourth, Matter;
a fifth, Spirit; a sixth, God, Theos, Zeus, Alfadir, Allah, or what he
pleases. All admit the existence of the Being, Power, or ENS, thus
diversely named. The name is of the smallest consequence.

*Real* Atheism is the denial of the existence of *any* God, of the
actuality of all possible ideas of God. It denies that there is any
Mind, Intelligence, or ENS, that is the Cause and Providence of the
Universe, and of any Thing or any Existence, Soul, Spirit, or Being,
that *intentionally* or *intelligently* produces the Order, Beauty, and
Harmony thereof, and the constant and regular modes of operation
therein. It must necessarily deny that there is any law, order, or
harmony in existence, or any constant mode of operation in the world;
for it is utterly impossible for any human creature to conceive, however
much he may *pretend* to do so, of either of these, except as a
consequence of the action of Intelligence; which is, indeed, that
otherwise unknown thing, the existence of which these alone prove;
otherwise than as the cause of these, not a thing at all; a mere *name*
for the wholly uncognizable cause of these.

The *real* atheist must deny the existence of the Qualities of God, deny
that there is any mind of or in the Universe, any self-conscious
Providence, any Providence at all. He must deny that there is any Being
or Cause of Finite things, that is self-consciously powerful, wise,
just, loving, and faithful to itself and its own nature. He must deny
that there is any *plan* in the Universe or any part of it. He must
hold, either that matter is eternal, or that it originated itself, which
is absurd, or that it was originated by an Intelligence, or at least by
a Cause; and then he admits a. God,

<span id="page_645">p. 645</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> No doubt it is
beyond the reach of our faculties to imagine *how* matter
originated,--how it began to *be*, in space where before was nothing, or
God only. But it is equally beyond the reach of our faculties to imagine
it eternal and *un*originated. To hold it to be eternal, without thought
or will; that the specific forms of it, the seed, the rock, the tree,
the man, the solar system, all came with no forethought planning or
producing them, by "chance" or "the fortuitous concourse of atoms" of
matter that has no thought or will; and that they indicate no mind, no
plan, no purpose, no providence, is absurd. It is not to deny the
*existence* of what we understand by mind, plan, purpose, Providence;
but to insist that these words shall have some other meaning than that
which the human race has ever attached to them: shall mean some unknown
thing, for which the human race has no *name*, because it has of such a
thing no possible idea. Either there never was any such thing as a
"plan," and the word is nonsense, or the Universe exists in conformity
to a plan. The *word* never meant, and never can mean, any other *thing*
than that which the Universe exhibits. So with the word "*purpose*;" so
with the word "*Providence*." They mean nothing, or else only what the
Universe proves.

It was soon found that the denial of a Conscious Power, the cause of man
and of his life, of a Providence, or a Mind and Intelligence arranging
man in reference to the world, and the world in reference to man, would
not satisfy the instinctive desires of *human* nature, or account for
the facts of *material* nature. It did not long answer to say, if it
ever *was* said, that the Universe was drifting in the void inane, and
neither it, nor any mind within or without it, knew of its whence, its
whither, or its whereabouts; that man was drifting in the Universe,
knowing little of his whereabouts, nothing of his whence or whither;
that there was no Mind, no Providence, no Power, that knew any better;
nothing hat guided and directed man in his drifting, or the Universe in
the weltering waste of Time. To say to man and woman, "your heroism,
your bravery, your self-denial all comes to nothing: your nobleness will
do you no good: you will die, and your nobleness will do mankind no
service; for there is no plan or order in all these things; everything
comes and goes by the fortuitous con-course of atoms;" did not, nor ever
will, long satisfy the human mind.

<span id="page_646">p. 646</span>

True, the theory of Atheism has been uttered. It has been said, "Death
is the end: this is a world without a God: you are a body without a
soul: there is a Here, but no Hereafter for you; an Earth, but no
Heaven. Die, and return to your dust. Man is bones, blood, bowels, and
brain; mind is matter: there is no soul in the brain, nothing but
nerves. We can see all the way to a little star in the nebula of Orion's
belt; so distant that it will take light a thousand millions of years to
come from it to the earth, journeying at the rate of twelve millions of
miles a minute. There is no Heaven this side of that: you see all the
way through: there is not a speck of Heaven; and do you think there is
any beyond it; and if so, when would you reach it? There is no
Providence. Nature is a fortuitous concourse of atoms; thought is a
fortuitous function of matter, a fortuitous result of a fortuitous
result, a chance-shot from the great wind-gun of the Universe,
accidentally loaded, pointed at random, and fired off by chance. Things
*happen*; they are not *arranged*. There is luck, and there is ill-luck;
but there is no Providence. Die you into dust!" Does all this satisfy
the human instinct of immortality, that makes us ever long, with
unutterable longing, to join ourselves again to our dear ones who have
gone away before us, and to mankind, for eternal life? Does it satisfy
our mighty hungering and thirst for immortality, our anxious longing to
come nearer to, and to know more of, the Eternal Cause of all things?

Men never could be content to believe that there was no mind that
thought for man, no conscience to enact eternal laws, no heart to love
those whom nothing of earth loves or cares for, no will of the Universe
to marshal the nations in the way of wisdom, justice, and love. History
is not--thank God! we know it is not,--the fortuitous concourse of
events, or Nature that of atoms. We cannot believe that there is no plan
nor purpose in Nature, to guide our going out and coming in: that there
is a mighty going, but it goes nowhere; that all beauty, wisdom,
affection, justice, morality in the world, is an accident, and may end
to-morrow.

All over the world there is heroism unrequited, or paid with misery;
vice on thrones, corruption in high places, nobleness in poverty or even
in chains, the gentle devotion of woman rewarded by brutal neglect or
more brutal abuse and violence; everywhere want, misery, over-work, and
under-wages. Add to these the Atheist's creed,--a body without a soul,
an earth without a

<span id="page_647">p. 647</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Heaven, a world
without a God; and what a Pandemonium would we make of this world!

The intellect of the Atheist would find matter everywhere; but no
Causing and Providing Mind: his moral sense would find no Equitable
Will, no Beauty of Moral Excellence, no Conscience enacting justice into
the unchanging law of right, no spiritual Order or spiritual Providence,
but only material Fate and Chance. His affections would find only finite
things to love; and to them the dead who *were* loved and who died
yesterday, are like the rainbow that yesterday evening lived a moment
and then passed away. His soul, flying through the vast Inane, and
feeling the darkness with its wings, seeking the Soul of all, which at
once is Reason, Conscience, and the Heart of all that is, would find no
God, but a Universe all disorder; no Infinite, no Reason, no Conscience,
no Heart, no Soul of things; nothing to reverence, to esteem, to love,
to worship, to trust in; but only an Ugly Force, alien and foreign to
us, that strikes down those we love, and makes us mere worms on the hot
sand of the world. No voice would speak from the Earth to comfort him.
It is a cruel mother, that great Earth, that devours her young,--a Force
and nothing more. Out of the sky would smile no kind Providence, in all
its thousand starry eyes; and in storms a malignant violence, with its
lightning-sword, would stab into the darkness, seeking for men to
murder.

No man ever was or ever can be content with that. The evidence of .God
has been ploughed into Nature so deeply, and so deeply woven into the
texture of the human soul, that Atheism has never become a faith, though
it has sometimes assumed the shape of theory. Religion is natural to
man. Instinctively he turns to God and reverences and relies on Him. In
the Mathematics of the Heavens, written in gorgeous diagrams of fire, he
sees law, order, beauty, harmony without end: in the ethics of the
little nations that inhabit the ant-hills he sees the same; in all
Nature, animate and inanimate, he sees the evidences of a Design, a
Will, an Intelligence, and a God,--of a God beneficent and loving as
well as wise, and merciful and indulgent as well as powerful.

To man, surrounded by the material Universe, and conscious of the
influence that his material environments exercised upon his fortunes and
his present destiny;--to man, ever confronted with the splendors of the
starry heavens, the regular march of the

<span id="page_648">p. 648</span>

seasons, the phenomena of sunrise and moonrise, and all the evidences of
intelligence and design that everywhere pressed upon and overwhelmed
him, all imaginable questions as to the nature and cause of these
phenomena constantly recurred, demanding to be solved, and refusing to
be sent away unanswered. And still, after the lapse of ages, press upon
the human mind and demand solution, the same great questions--perhaps
still demanding it in vain.

Advancing to the period when man had ceased to look upon the separate
parts and individual forces of the Universe as gods,--when he had come
to look upon it as a whole, this question, among the earliest, occurred
to him, and insisted on being answered: "Is this material Universe
self-existent, or was it created? Is it eternal, or did it originate?"

And then in succession came crowding on the human mind these other
questions:

"Is this material Universe a mere aggregate of fortuitous combinations
of matter, or is it the result and work of intelligence, acting upon a
plan?

"If there *be* such an Intelligence, what and where is it? Is the
material Universe *itself* an Intelligent being? Is it like man, a body
and a soul? Does Nature act upon itself, or is there a Cause beyond it
that acts upon it?

"If there is a *personal* God, *separate from* the material Universe,
that created all things, Himself uncreated, is He corporeal or
incorporeal, material or spiritual, the soul of the Universe or wholly
apart from it? and if He be Spirit, what then is spirit?

"Was that Supreme Deity active or quiescent before the creation; and if
quiescent during a previous eternity, what necessity of His nature moved
Him at last to create a world; or was it a mere whim that had no motive?

"Was matter co-existent with Him, or absolutely created by him out of
nothing? Did He *create* it, or only *mould* and *shape* and *fashion* a
chaos already existing, co-existent with Himself?

"Did the Deity *directly* create matter, or was creation the work of
inferior deities, emanations from Himself?

"If He be good and just, whence comes it that, foreknowing everything,
He has allowed sorrow and evil to exist; and how to reconcile with His
benevolence and wisdom the prosperity of vice and the misfortunes of
virtue in this world?"

<span id="page_649">p. 649</span>

And then, as to man himself, recurred these other questions, as they
continue to recur to all of us:

"What is it in us that thinks? Is Thought the mere result of material
organization; or is there in us a *soul* that thinks, separate from and
resident in the body? If the latter, is it eternal and uncreated; and if
not, how created? Is it distinct from God, or an emanation from Him? Is
it *inherently* immortal, or only so by destination, because God has
willed it? Is it to return to and be merged in Him, or ever to exist,
separately from Him, with its present identity?

"If God has fore-seen and fore-arranged all that occurs, how has man any
real free-will, or the least control over circumstances? How can
anything be done *against* the will of Infinite Omnipotence; and if all
is done *according* to that will, how is there any wrong or evil, in
what Infinite Wisdom and Infinite Power does not choose to prevent?

"What is the foundation of the moral law? Did God enact it of His own
mere pleasure; and if so, can He not, when He pleases, repeal it? Who
shalt assure us He will not repeal it, and make right wrong, and virtue
vice? Or is the moral law a necessity of His nature; and if so, who
enacted it; and does not that assert a power, like the old Necessity,
superior to Deity?"

And, close-following after these, came the great question of HEREAFTER,
of another Life, of the soul's Destiny; and the thousand other
collateral and subordinate questions, as to matter, spirit, futurity,
and God, that have produced all the systems of philosophy, all
metaphysics, and all theology, since the world began.

What the old philosophic mind thought upon these great questions, we
have already, to some extent, developed. With the Emanation-doctrine of
the Gnostics and the Orient, we have endeavored to make you familiar. We
have brought you face to face with the Kabalists, the Essenes, and Philo
the Jew. We have shown that, and how, much of the old mythology was
derived from the daily and yearly recurring phenomena of the heavens. We
have exhibited to you the ancient notions by which they endeavored to
explain to themselves the existence and prevalence of evil; and we have
in some degree made known to you their metaphysical ideas as to the
nature of the Deity. Much more remains to be done than it is within our
power to do.

<span id="page_650">p. 650</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> We stand upon the
sounding shore of the great ocean of Time. In front of us stretches out
the heaving waste of the illimitable Past; and its waves, as they roll
up to our feet along the sparkling slope of the yellow sands, bring to
us, now and then, from the depths of that boundless ocean, a shell, a
few specimens of algæ torn rudely from their stems, a rounded pebble;
and that is all; of all the vast treasures of ancient thought that lie
buried there, with the mighty anthem of the boundless ocean thundering
over them forever and forever.

Let us once more, and for the last time, along the shore of that great
ocean, gather a few more relics of the Past, and listen to its mighty
voices, as they come, in fragmentary music, in broken and interrupted
rhythm, whispering to us from the great bosom of the Past.

Rites, creeds, and legends express, directly or symbolically, some
leading idea, according to which the Mysteries of Being are supposed to
be explained in Deity. The intricacies of mythical genealogies are a
practical acknowledgment of the mysterious nature of the Omnipotent
Deity; displaying in their beautiful but ineffectual imagery the first
efforts of the mind to communicate with nature: the flowers which fancy
strewed before the youthful steps of Psyche, when she first set out in
pursuit of the immortal object of her love. Theories and notions, in all
their varieties of truth and falsehood, are a machinery more or less
efficacious, directed to the same end. Every religion was, in its
origin, an embryo philosophy, or an attempt to interpret the unknown by
mind; and it was only when philosophy, which is essentially progress,
outgrew its first acquisitions, that religion became a thing apart,
cherishing as unalterable dogmas the notions which philosophy had
abandoned. Separated from philosophy, it became arrogant and
fantastical, professing to have already attained what its more authentic
representative was ever pursuing in vain; and discovering, through its
initiations and Mysteries, all that to its contracted view seemed
wanting to restore the well-being of mankind, the means of purification
and expiation, remedies for disease, expedients to cure the disorders of
the soul, and to propitiate the gods.

Why should we attempt to confine the idea of the Supreme Mind within an
arbitrary barrier, or exclude from the limits of veracity any conception
of the Deity, which, if imperfect and

<span id="page_651">p. 651</span>

inadequate, may be only a little more so than our own? "The name of
God," says Hobbes, "is used not to make us *conceive* Him, for He is
inconceivable, but that we may *honor* Him." "Believe in God, and adore
Him," said the Greek Poet, "but investigate Him not; the inquiry is
fruitless, seek not to discover who God is; for, by the desire to know,
you offend Him who chooses to remain unknown." "When we attempt," says
Philo, "to investigate the essence of the Absolute Being, we fall into
an abyss of perplexity; and the only benefit to be derived from such
researches is the conviction of their absurdity."

Yet man, though ignorant of the constitution of the dust on which he
treads, has ventured, and still ventures, to speculate on the nature of
God, and to define dogmatically in creeds the subject least within the
compass of his faculties; and even to hate and persecute those who will
not accept his views as true.

But though a knowledge of the Divine Essence is impossible, the
conceptions formed respecting it are interesting, as indications of
intellectual development. The history of religion is the history of the
human mind; and the conception formed by it of Deity is always in exact
relation to its moral and intellectual attainments. The one is the index
and the measure of the other.

The *negative* notion of God, which consists in abstracting the inferior
and finite, is, according to Philo, the only way in which it is possible
for man worthily to apprehend the nature of God. After exhausting the
varieties of symbolism, we contrast the Divine Greatness with human
littleness, and employ expressions apparently affirmative, such as
"Infinite," "Almighty," "All-wise," "Omnipotent," "Eternal," and the
like; which in reality amount only to denying, in regard to God, those
limits which con-fine the faculties of man; and thus we remain content
with a name which is a mere conventional sign and confession of our
ignorance.

The Hebrew ‏ו ?Y?H?W?H‎ and the Greek *To ON* expressed abstract
existence, without outward manifestation or development. Of the same
nature are the definitions, "God is a sphere whose centre is everywhere,
and whose circumference nowhere;" "God is He who sees all, Himself
unseen:" and finally, that of Proclus and Hegel--"the Το μη ον--that
which has no outward and positive existence." Most of the so-called
ideas or definitions of the "Absolute" are only a collection of
negations; from which, as they affirm nothing, nothing is learned.

<span id="page_652">p. 652</span>

God was first recognized in the heavenly bodies and in the elements.
When man's consciousness of his own intellectuality was matured, and he
became convinced that the internal faculty of thought was something more
subtle than even the most subtle elements, he transferred that new
conception to the object of his worship, and deified a mental principle
instead of a physical one. He in every case makes God after his own
image; for do what we will, the highest efforts of human thought can
conceive nothing higher than the supremacy of intellect; and so he ever
conies back to some familiar type of exalted humanity. He at first
deifies nature, and afterward himself.

The eternal aspiration of the religious sentiment in man is to become
united with God. In his earliest development, the wish and its
fulfillment were simultaneous, through unquestioning belief. In
proportion as the conception of Deity was exalted, the notion of His
terrestrial presence or proximity was abandoned; and the difficulty of
comprehending the Divine Government, together with the glaring
superstitious evils arising out of its misinterpretation, endangered the
belief in it altogether.

Even the lights of Heaven, which, as "bright potentates of the sky,"
were formerly the vigilant directors of the economy of earth, now shine
dim and distant, and Uriel no more descends upon a sunbeam. But the real
change has been in the progressive ascent of man's own faculties, and
not in the Divine Nature; as the Stars are no more distant now than when
they were supposed to rest on the shoulders of Atlas. And yet a little
sense of disappointment and humiliation attended the first awakening of
the soul, when reason, looking upward toward the Deity, was impressed
with a dizzy sense of having fallen.

But hope revives in despondency; and every nation that ever advanced
beyond the most elementary conceptions, felt the necessity of an attempt
to fill the chasm, real or imaginary, separating man from God. To do
this was the great task of poetry, philosophy, and religion. Hence the
personifications of God's attributes, developments, and manifestations,
as "Powers," "Intelligences," "Angels," "Emanations;" through which and
the oracular faculty in himself, man could place himself in communion
with God.

The various ranks and orders of mythical beings imagined by Persians,
Indians, Egyptians, or Etrurians, to preside over the various
departments of nature, had each his share in a scheme to

<span id="page_653">p. 653</span>

bring man into closer approximation to the Deity; they eventually gave
way only before an analogous though less picturesque symbolism; and the
Deities and Dæmons of Greece and Rome were perpetuated with only a
change of names, when their offices were transferred to Saints and
Martyrs. The attempts by which reason had sometimes endeavored to span
the unknown by a bridge of metaphysics, such as the idealistic systems
of Zoroaster, Pythagoras, or Plato, were only a more refined form of the
poetical illusions which satisfied the vulgar; and man still looked back
with longing to the lost golden age, when his ancestors communed face to
face with the Gods; and hoped that, by propitiating Heaven, he might
accelerate the renewal of it in the islands of the Far West, under the
sceptre of Kronos, or in a centralization of political power at
Jerusalem. His eager hope overcame even the terrors of the grave; for
the Divine power was as infinite as human expectation, and the Egyptian,
duly ensepulchred in the Lybian Catacombs, was supposed to be already on
his way to the Fortunate Abodes under the guidance of Hermes, there to
obtain a perfect association and reunion with his God.

Remembering what we have already said elsewhere in regard to the old
ideas concerning the Deity, and repeating it as little as possible, let
us once more put ourselves in communion with the Ancient poetic and
philosophic mind, and endeavor to learn of it what it thought, and how
it solved the great problems that have ever tortured the human
intellect.

The division of the First and Supreme Cause into two parts, one Active
and the other Passive, the Universe Agent and Patient, or the
hermaphroditic God-World, is one of the most ancient and widespread
dogmas of philosophy or natural theology. Almost every ancient people
gave it a place in their worship, their mysteries, and their ceremonies.

Ocellus Lucanus, who seems to have lived shortly after Pythagoras opened
his School in Italy, five or six hundred years before our era, and in
the time of Solon, Thales, and the other Sages who had studied in the
Schools of Egypt, not only recognizes the eternity of the Universe, and
its divine character as an unproduced and indestructible being, but also
the distinction of Active and Passive causes in what he terms the Grand
Whole, or the single hermaphroditic Being that comprehends all
existences, as well causes as effects; and which is a system regularly
ordered, perfect

<span id="page_654">p. 654</span>

and complete, of all Natures. He well apprehended the dividing-line that
separates existence eternally the same, from that which eternally
changes; the nature of celestial from that of terrestrial bodies, that
of causes from that of effects, that which is from that which only
BECOMES,--a distinction that naturally struck every thinking man.

We shall not quote his language at full length. The heavenly bodies, he
thought, are first and most noble; they move of themselves, and ever
revolve, without change of form or essence. Fire, water, earth, and air
change incessantly and continually, not place, but form. Then, as in the
Universe there are generation and cause of generation,--as generation is
where there are change and displacement of parts, and cause where there
is stability of nature, evidently it belongs to what is the cause of
generation, to move and to act, and to the recipient, to be made and
moved. In his view, everything above the Moon was the habitation of the
gods; all below, that of Nature and discord; *this* operates dissolution
of things made; *that*, production of those that are being made. As the
world is unproduced and indestructible, as it had no beginning, and will
have no end, necessarily the principle that operates generation in
another than itself, and that which operates it in itself, have
co-existed.

The former is all above the moon, and especially the sun: the latter is
the sublunary world. Of these two parts, one active, the other
passive--one divine and always the same, the other mortal and ever
changing, all that we call the "world" or "universe" is composed.

These accorded with the principles of the Egyptian philosophy, which
held that man and the animals had always existed together with the
world; that they were its effects, eternal like itself. The chief
divisions of nature into active and passive causes, its system of
generation and destruction, and the concurrence of the two great
principles, Heaven and earth, uniting to form all things, will,
according to Ocellus, always continue to exist. "Enough," he concludes,
"as to the Universe, the generations and destructions effected in it,
the mode in which it now exists, the mode in which it will ever exist,
by the eternal qualities of the two principles, one always moving, the
other always moved; one always *governing*, the other always
*governed*."

Such is a brief summary of the doctrine of this philosopher,

<span id="page_655">p. 655</span>

whose work is one of the most ancient that has survived to us. The
subject on which he treated occupied in his time all men's minds: the
poets sang of cosmogonies and theogonies, and the philosophers wrote
treatises on the birth of the world and the elements of its composition.
The cosmogony of the Hebrews; attributed to Moses; that of the
Phœnicians, ascribed to Sanchoniathon; that of the Greeks, composed by
Hesiod; that of the Egyptians, the Atlantes, and the Cretans, preserved
by Diodorus Siculus; the fragments of the theology of Orpheus, divided
among different writers; the books of the Persians, or their Boundehesh;
those of the Hindu\_s; the traditions of the Chinese and the people of
Macassar; the cosmogonic chants which Virgil puts in the mouth of Iopas
at Carthage; and those of the old Silenus, the first book of the
Metamorphoses of Ovid; all testify to the antiquity and universality of
these fictions as to the origin of the world and its causes.

At the head of the causes of nature, Heaven and earth were placed; and
the most apparent parts of each, the sun, the moon, the fixed stars and
planets, and, above all, the zodiac, among the *active* causes of
generation; and among the *passive*, the several elements. These causes
were not only classed in the progressive order of their energy, Heaven
and earth heading the respective lists, but distinct sexes were in some
sort assigned to them, and characteristics analogous to the mode in
which they concur in universal generation.

The doctrine of Ocellus was the general doctrine everywhere, it
naturally occurring to all to make the same distinction. The Egyptians
did so, in selecting those animals in which they recognized these
emblematic qualities, in order to symbolize the double sex of the
Universe. Their God KNEPH, out of whose mouth issued the Orphic egg,
whence the author of the Clementine Recognitions makes a hermaphroditic
figure to emerge, uniting in itself the two principles whereof Heaven
and the earth are forms, and which enter into the organization of all
beings which the heavens and the earth engender by their concourse,
furnishes another emblem of the double power, active and passive, which
the ancients saw in the Universe, and which they symbolized by the egg.
Orpheus, who studied in Egypt, borrowed from the theologians of that
country the mysterious forms under which the science of nature was
veiled, and carried into Greece the symbolic

<span id="page_656">p. 656</span>

egg, with its division into two parts or causes figured by the
hermaphroditic being that issued from it, and whereof Heaven and earth
are composed.

The Brahmins of India expressed the same cosmogonic idea by a statue,
representative of the Universe, uniting in itself both sexes. The male
sex offered an image of the sun, centre of the active principle, and the
female sex that of the moon, at the sphere whereof, proceeding downward,
the passive portion of nature begins. The Lingam, unto the present day
revered in the Indian temples, being but the conjunction of the organs
of generation of the two sexes, was an emblem of the same. The Hindu\_s
have ever had the greatest veneration for this symbol of
ever-reproductive nature. The Greeks consecrated the same symbols of
universal fruitfulness in their Mysteries; and they were exhibited in
the sanctuaries of Eleusis. They appear among the sculptured ornaments
of all the Indian temples. Tertullian accuses the Valentinians of having
adopted the custom of venerating them; a custom, he says, introduced by
Melampus from Egypt into Greece. The Egyptians consecrated the Phallus
in the Mysteries of Osiris and Isis, as we learn from Plutarch and
Diodorus Siculus; and the latter assures us that these emblems were not
consecrated by the Egyptians alone, but by every people. They certainly
were so among the Persians and Assyrians; and they were regarded
everywhere as symbolic of the generative and productive powers of all
animated beings. In those early ages, the works of Nature and all her
agents were sacred like herself.

For the union of Nature with herself is a chaste marriage, of which the
union of man and woman was a natural image, and their organs were an
expressive emblem of the double energy which manifests itself in Heaven
and Earth uniting together to produce all beings. "The Heavens," says
Plutarch, "seemed to men to fulfill the functions of father, and the
Earth of mother. The former impregnated the earth with its fertilizing
rains, and the earth, receiving them, became fruitful and brought
forth." Heaven, which covers and embraces the earth everywhere, is her
potent spouse, uniting himself to her to make her fruitful, without
which she would languish in everlasting sterility, buried in the shades
of chaos and of night. Their union is their marriage; their productions
or parts are their children. The skies are our Father, and Nature the
great Mother of us all.

<span id="page_657">p. 657</span>

This idea was not the dogma of a single sect, but the general opinion of
all the Sages. "Nature was divided," says Cicero, '"into two parts, one
active, and the other that submitted itself to this action, which it
received, and which modified it. The former was deemed to be a Force,
and the latter the material on which that Force exerted itself."
Macrobius repeated almost literally the doctrine of Ocellus. Aristotle
termed the earth the fruitful mother, environed on all sides by the air.
Above it was Heaven, the dwelling-place of the gods and the divine
stars, its substance ether, or a fire incessantly moving in circles,
divine and incorruptible, and subject to no change. Below it, nature,
and the elements, imitable and acted on, corruptible and mortal.

Synesius said that generations were effected in the portions of the
Universe which we inhabit; while the cause of generations resided in the
portions above us, whence descend to us the germs of the effects
produced here below. Proclus and Simplicius deemed Heaven the Active
Cause and Father, relatively to the earth. The former says that the
World or the Whole is a single Animal; what is done *in* it, is done
*by* it; the same World *acts*, and *acts upon itself*. He divides it
into "Heaven" and "Generation." In the former, he says, are placed and
arranged the conservative causes of generation, superintended by the
Genii and Gods. The Earth, or Rhea, associated ever with Saturn in
production, is mother of the effects of which Heaven is Father; the womb
or bosom that receives the fertilizing energy of the God that engenders
ages. The great work of generation is operated, he says, primarily by
the action of the Sun, and secondarily by that of the Moon, so that the
Sun is the primitive source of this energy, as father and chief of the
male gods that form his court. He follows the action of the male and
female principles through all the portions and divisions of nature,
attributing to the former the origin of stability and identity, to the
latter, that of diversity and mobility. Heaven is to the earth, he says,
as the male to the female. It is the movement of the heavens that, by
their revolutions, furnished the seminal incitements and forces, whose
emanations received by the earth, make it fruitful, and cause it to
produce animals and plants of every kind.

Philo says that Moses recognized this doctrine of two causes, active and
passive; but made the former to reside in the Mind or Intelligence
external to matter.

<span id="page_658">p. 658</span>

The ancient astrologers divided the twelve signs of the Zodiac into six
male and six female, and assigned them to six male and six female Great
Gods. Heaven and Earth, or Ouranos and Ghê, were among most ancient
nations, the first and most ancient Divinities. We find them in the
Phœnician history of Sanchoniathon, and in the Grecian Genealogy of the
Gods given by Hesiod. Everywhere they marry, and by their union produce
the later Gods. "In the beginning," says Apollodorus, "Ouranos or the
Heavens was Lord of all the Universe: he took to wife Ghê or the earth,
and had by her many children." They were the first Gods of the Cretans,
and under other names, of the Armenians, as we learn from Berosus, and
of Panchaîa, an island South of Arabia, as we learn from Euhemerus.
Orpheus made the Divinity, or the "Great Whole," male and female,
because, he said, it could produce nothing, unless it united in itself
the productive force of both sexes. He called Heaven PANGENETOR, the
Father of all things, most ancient of Beings, beginning and end of all,
containing in Himself the incorruptible and unwearying force of
Necessity.

The same idea obtained in the rude North of Europe. The Scythians made
the earth to be the wife of Jupiter; and the Germans adored her under
the name of HERTA. The Celts worshipped the Heavens and the Earth, and
said that without the former the latter would be sterile, and that their
marriage produced all things. The Scandinavians acknowledged BÖR or the
Heavens, and gave FURTUR, his son, the Earth as his wife. Olaus Rudbeck
adds, that their ancestors were persuaded that Heaven intermarried with
the Earth, and thus uniting his forces with hers, produced animals and
plants. This marriage of Heaven and Earth produced the AZES, Genii
famous in the theology of the North. In the theology of the Phrygians
and Lydians, the ASII were born of the marriage of the Supreme God with
the Earth, and Firmicus informs us that the Phrygians attributed to the
Earth supremacy over the other elements, and considered her the Great
Mother of all things.

Virgil sings the impregnation of the joyous earth, by the Ether, its
spouse, that descends upon its bosom, fertilizing it with rains.
Columella sings the loves of Nature and her marriage with Heaven
annually consummated at the sweet Spring-time. He describes the Spirit
of Life, the soul that animates the world, fired with the passion of
Love, uniting with Nature and itself, itself a part of

<span id="page_659">p. 659</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Nature, and
filling its own bosom with new productions. This union of the Universe
with itself, this mutual action of two sexes, he terms "the great
Secrets of Nature," the Mysteries of the Union of Heaven with Earth,
imaged in the Sacred Mysteries of Atys and Bacchus."

Varro tells us that the great Divinities adored at Samothrace were the
Heavens and the Earth, considered as First Causes or Primal Gods, and as
male and female agents, one bearing to the other the relations that the
Soul and Principle of Movement bear to the body or the matter that
receives them. These were the gods revered in the Mysteries of that
Island, as they were in the orgies of Phœnicia.

Everywhere the sacred body of Nature was covered with the veil of
allegory, which concealed it from the profane, and allowed it to be seen
only by the sage who thought it worthy to be the object of his study and
investigation. She showed herself to those only who loved her in spirit
and in truth, and she abandoned the indifferent and careless to error
and to ignorance. "The Sages of Greece," says Pausanias, "never wrote
otherwise than in an enigmatical manner, never naturally and directly."
"Nature," says Sallust the Philosopher, "should be sung only in a
language that imitates the secrecy of her processes and operations. She
is herself an enigma. We see only bodies in movement; the forces and
springs that move them are hidden from us." The poets inspired by the
Divinity, the wisest philosophers, all the theologians, the chiefs of
the initiations and Mysteries, even the gods uttering their oracles,
have borrowed the figurative language of allegory. "The Egyptians," says
Proclus, "preferred that mode of teaching, and spoke of the great
secrets of Nature, only in mythological enigmas." The Gymnosophists of
India and the Druids of Gaul lent to science the same enigmatic
language, and in the same style wrote the Hierophants of Phœnicia.

The division of things into the active and the passive cause leads to
that of the two Principles of Light and Darkness, connected with and
corresponding with it. For Light comes from the ethereal substance that
composes the active cause, and darkness from earth or the gross matter
which composes the passive cause. In Hesiod, the Earth, by its union
with Tartarus, engenders Typhon. Chief of the Powers or Genii of
Darkness. But it unites

<span id="page_660">p. 660</span>

itself with the Ether or Ouranos, when it engenders the Gods of Olympus,
or the Stars, children of Starry Ouranos.

Light was the first Divinity worshipped by men. To it they owed the
brilliant spectacle of Nature. It seems an emanation from the Creator of
all things, making known to our senses the Universe which darkness hides
from our eyes, and, as it were, giving it existence. Darkness, as it
were, reduces all nature again to nothingness, and almost entirely
annihilates man.

Naturally, therefore, two substances of opposite natures were imagined,
to each of which the world was in turn subjected, one contributing to
its felicity and the other to its misfortune. Light multiplied its
enjoyments; Darkness despoiled it of them: the former was its friend,
the latter its enemy. To one all good was attributed; to the other all
evil; and thus the words "Light" and "Good" became synonymous, and the
words "Darkness" and "Evil." It seeming that Good and Evil could not
flow from one and the same source, any more than could Light and
Darkness, men naturally imagined two Causes or Principles, of different
natures and opposite in their effects, one of which shed Light and Good,
and the other Darkness and Evil, on the Universe.

This distinction of the two Principles was admitted in all the
Theologies, and formed one of the principal bases of all religions. It
entered as a primary element into the sacred fables, the cosmogonies and
the Mysteries of antiquity. "We are not to suppose," says Plutarch,
"that the Principles of the Universe are inanimate bodies, as Democritus
and Epicurus thought; nor that a matter devoid of qualities is organized
and arranged by a single Reason or Providence, Sovereign over all
things, as the Stoics held; for it is not possible that a single Being,
good or evil, is the cause of all, inasmuch as God can in nowise be the
cause of any evil. The harmony of the Universe is a combination of
contraries, like the strings of a lyre, or that of a bow, which
alternately is stretched and relaxed." "The good," says Euripides, "is
never separated from the Evil. The two must mingle, that all may go
well." And this opinion as to the two principles, continues Plutarch,
"is that of all antiquity. From the Theologians and Legislators it
passed to the Poets and Philosophers. Its author is unknown; but the
opinion itself is established by the traditions of the whole human race,
and consecrated in the mysteries and sacrifices both of the Greeks and
Barbarians, wherein was recognized the dogma of

<span id="page_661">p. 661</span>

opposing principles in nature, which, by their contrariety, produce the
mixture of good and evil. We must admit two contrary causes, two
opposing powers, which lead, one to the right and the other to the left,
and thus control our life, as they do the sublunary world, which is
therefore subject to so many changes and irregularities of every kind.
For if there can be no effect without a cause, and if the Good cannot be
the cause of the Evil, it is absolutely necessary that there should be a
cause for the Evil, as there is one for the Good." This doctrine, he
adds, has been generally received among most nations, and especially by
those who have had the greatest reputation for wisdom. All have admitted
two gods, with different occupations, one making the good and the other
the evil found in nature. The former has been styled "God," the latter
"Demon." The Persians, or Zoroaster, named the former Ormuzd and the
latter Ahriman; of whom they said one was of the nature of Light, the
other of that of Darkness. The Egyptians called the former Osiris, and
the latter Typhon, his eternal enemy.

The Hebrews, at least after their return from the Persian captivity, had
their good Deity, and the Devil, a bad and malicious Spirit, ever
opposing God, and Chief of the Angels of Darkness, as God was of those
of Light. The word "Satan" means, in Hebrew, simply, "The Adversary."

The Chaldæans, Plutarch says, had their good and evil stars. The Greeks
had their Jupiter and Pluto, and their Giants and Titans, to whom were
assigned the attributes of the Serpent with which Pluto or Serapis was
encircled, and the shape whereof was assumed by Typhon, Ahriman, and the
Satan of the Hebrews. Every people had something equivalent to this.

The People of Pegu believe in two Principles, one author of Good and the
other of Evil, and strive to propitiate the latter, while they think it
needless to worship the former, as he is incapable of doing evil. The
people of Java, of the Moluccas, of the Gold Coast, the Hottentots, the
people of Teneriffe and Madagascar, and the Savage Tribes of America,
all worship and strive to avert the anger and propitiate the good-will
of the Evil Spirit.

But among the Greeks, Egyptians, Chaldæans, Persians, and Assyrians, the
doctrine of the two Principles formed a complete and regularly arranged
theological system. It was the basis of the religion of the Magi and of
Egypt. The author of an ancient

<span id="page_662">p. 662</span>

work, attributed to Origen, says that Pythagoras learned from Zarastha,
a Magus at Babylon (the same, perhaps, as Zerdusht or Zoroaster), that
there are two principles of all things, whereof one is the *father* and
the other the *mother*; the former, Light, and the latter, Darkness.
Pythagoras thought that the Dependencies on Light were warmth, dryness,
lightness, swiftness; and those on Darkness, cold, wet, weight, and
slowness; and that the world derived its existence from these two
principles, as from the male and the female. According to Porphyry, he
conceived two opposing powers, one good, which he termed Unity, the
Light, Right, the Equal, the Stable, the Straight; the other evil, which
he termed Binary, Darkness, the Left, the Unequal, the Unstable, the
Crooked. These ideas he received from the Orientals, for he dwelt twelve
years at Babylon, studying with the Magi. Varro says he recognized two
Principles of all things,--the Finite and the Infinite, Good and Evil,
Life and Death, Day and Night. White he thought was of the nature of the
Good Principle, and Black of that of the Evil; that Light and Darkness,
Heat and Cold, the Dry and the Wet, mingled in equal proportions; that
Summer was the triumph of heat, and Winter of cold; that their equal
combination produced Spring and Autumn, the former producing verdure and
favorable to health, and the latter, deteriorating everything, giving
birth to maladies. He applied the same idea to the rising and setting of
the sun; and, like the Magi, held that God or Ormuzd in the body
resembled light, and in the soul, truth.

Aristotle, like Plato, admitted a principle of Evil, resident in matter
and in its eternal imperfection.

The Persians said that Ormuzd, born of the pure Light, and Ahriman, born
of darkness, were ever at war. Ormuzd produced six Gods, Beneficence,
Truth, Good Order, Wisdom, Riches, and Virtuous Joy. These were so many
emanations from the Good Principle, so many blessings bestowed by it on
men. Ahriman, in his turn, produced six Devs, opponents of the six
emanations from Ormuzd. Then Ormuzd made himself three times as great as
before, ascended as far above the sun as the sun is above the earth, and
adorned the heavens with stars, of which he made Sirius the sentinel or
advance-guard: that he then created twenty-four other Deities, and
placed them in an egg, where Ahriman also placed twenty-four others,
created by him, who broke the egg,

<span id="page_663">p. 663</span>

and so intermingled Good and Evil. Theopompus adds that, according to
the Magi, for two terms of three thousand years, each of the two
Principles is to be by turns victor and the other vanquished; then for
three thousand more for each they are to contend with each other, each
destroying reciprocally the works of the other; after which Ahriman is
to perish, and men, wearing transparent bodies, to enjoy unutterable
happiness.

The twelve great Deities of the Persians, the six Amshaspands and six
Devs, marshalled, the former under the banner of Light, and the latter
under that of Darkness, are the twelve Zodiacal Signs or Months; the six
supreme signs, or those of Light, or of Spring and Summer, commencing
with Aries, and the six inferior, of Darkness, or of Autumn and Winter,
commencing with Libra. Limited Time, as contradistinguished from Time
without limits, or Eternity, is Time created and measured by the
celestial revolutions. It is comprehended in a period divided into
twelve parts, each subdivided into a thousand parts, which the Persians
termed years. Thus the circle annually traversed by the Sun was divided
into 12,000 parts, or each sign into 3,000: and thus, each year, the
Principle of Light and Good triumphed for 3,000 years, that of Evil and
Darkness for 3,000, and they mutually destroyed each other's labors for
6,000, or 3,000 for each: so that the Zodiac was equally divided between
them. And accordingly Ocellus Lucanus, the Disciple of Pythagoras, held
that the principal cause of all sublunary effects resided in the Zodiac,
and that from it flowed the good or bad influences of the planets that
revolved therein.

The twenty-four good and twenty-four evil Deities, enclosed in the Egg,
are the forty-eight constellations of the ancient sphere, equally
divided between the realms of Light and Darkness, on the concavity of
the celestial sphere which was apportioned among them; and which,
enclosing the world and planets, was the mystic and sacred egg of the
Magi, the Indians, and the Egyptians,--the egg that issued from the
mouth of the God Kneph, that figured as the Orphic Egg in the Mysteries
of Greece, that issued from the God Chumong of the Coresians, and from
the Egyptian Osiris and the God Phanes of the Modern Orphics, Principle
of Light,--the egg crushed by the Sacred Bull of the Japanese, and from
which the world emerged; that placed by the Greeks at the feet of
Bacchus the bull-horned God, and from which Aristophanes makes Love
emerge, who with Night organizes Chaos.

<span id="page_664">p. 664</span>

Thus the Balance, the Scorpion, the Serpent of Ophiucus, and the Dragon
of the Hesperides became malevolent Signs and Evil Genii; and entire
nature was divided between the two principles, and between the agents or
partial causes subordinate to them. Hence Michael and his Archangels,
and Satan and his fallen compeers. Hence the wars of Jupiter and the
Giants, in which the Gods of Olympus fought on the side of the
Light-God, against the dark progeny of earth and Chaos; a war which
Proclus regarded as symbolizing the resistance opposed by dark and
chaotic matter to the active and beneficent force which gives it
organization; an idea which in part appears in the old theory of two
Principles, one innate in the active and luminous substance of Heaven,
and the other in the inert and dark substance of matter that resists the
order and the good that Heaven communicates to it.

Osiris conquers Typhon, and Ormuzd, Ahriman, when, at the Vernal
Equinox, the creative action of Heaven and its demiourgic energy is most
strongly manifested. Then the principle of Light and Good overcomes that
of Darkness and Evil, and the world rejoices, redeemed from cold and
wintry darkness by the beneficent Sign into which the Sun then enters
triumphant and rejoicing, after his resurrection.

From the doctrine of the two Principles, Active and Passive, grew that
of the Universe, animated by a Principle of Eternal Life, and by a
Universal Soul, from which every isolated and temporary being received
at its birth an emanation, which, at the death of such being, returned
to its source. The life of matter as much belonged to nature as did
matter itself; and as life is manifested by movement, the sources of
life must needs seem to be placed in those luminous and eternal bodies,
and above all in the Heaven in which they revolve, and which whirls them
along with itself in that rapid course that is swifter than all other
movement. And fire and heat have so great an analogy with life, that
cold, like absence of movement, seemed the distinctive characteristic of
death. Accordingly, the vital fire that blazes in the Sun and produces
the heat that vivifies everything, was regarded as the principle of
organization and life of all sublunary beings.

According to this doctrine, the Universe is not to be regarded, in its
creative and eternal action, merely as an immense machine, moved by
powerful springs and forced into a continual movement, which, emanating
from the circumference, extends to the centre,

<span id="page_665">p. 665</span>

acts and re-acts in every possible direction, and re-produces in
succession all the varied forms which matter receives. So to regard it
would be to recognize a cold and purely mechanical action, the energy of
which could never produce life.

On the contrary, it was thought, the Universe should be deemed an
immense Being, always living, always moved and always moving in an
eternal activity inherent in itself, and which, subordinate to no
foreign cause, is communicated to all its parts, connects them together,
and makes of the world of things a complete and perfect whole. The order
and harmony which reign therein seem to belong to and be a part of it,
and the design of the various plans of construction of organized beings
would seem to be graven in its Supreme Intelligence, source of all the
other Intelligences which it communicates together with life to man.
Nothing existing out of it, it must be regarded as the principle and
term of all things.

Chæremon had no reason for saying that the Ancient Egyptians, inventors
of the sacred fables, and adorers of the Sun and the other luminaries,
saw in the Universe only a machine, without life and without
intelligence, either in its whole or in its parts; and that their
cosmogony was a pure Epicureanism, which required only matter and
movement to organize its world and govern it. Such an opinion would
necessarily exclude all religious worship. Wherever we suppose a
worship, there we must suppose intelligent Deities who receive it, and
are sensible to the homage of their adorers; and no other people were so
religious as the Egyptians.

On the contrary, with them the immense, immutable, and Eternal Being,
termed "God" or "the Universe," had eminently, and in all their
plenitude, that life and intelligence which sublunary beings, each an
infinitely small and temporary portion of itself, possess in a far
inferior degree and infinitely less quantity. It was to them, in some
sort, like the Ocean, whence the springs, brooks, and rivers have risen
by evaporation, and to the bosom whereof they return by a longer or
shorter course, and after a longer or shorter separation from the
immense mass of its waters. The machine of the Universe was, in their
view, like that of man, moved by a Principle of Life which kept it in
eternal activity, and circulated in all its parts. The Universe was a
living and animated being, like man and the other animals; or rather
they were so only because the Universe was essentially so, and for a few
moments communicated to each an infinitely minute portion of

<span id="page_666">p. 666</span>

its eternal life, breathed by it into the inert and gross matter of
sublunary bodies. That withdrawn, man or the animal died; and the
Universe alone, living and circulating around the wrecks of their
bodies, by its eternal movement, organized and animated new bodies,
returning to them the eternal fire and subtle substance which vivifies
itself, and which, incorporated in its immense mass, was its universal
soul.

These were the ancient ideas as to this Great GOD, Father of all the
gods, or of the World; of this BEING, Principle of all things, and of
which nothing other than itself is Principle,--the Universal cause that
was termed God. Soul of the Universe, eternal like it, immense like it,
supremely active and potent in its varied operations, penetrating all
parts of this vast body, impressing a regular and symmetrical movement
on the spheres, making the elements instinct with activity and order,
mingling with everything, organizing everything, vivifying and
preserving everything,--this was the UNIVERSE-GOD which the ancients
adored as Supreme Cause and God of Gods.

Anchises, in the Æneid, taught Æneas this doctrine of Pythagoras,
learned by him from his Masters, the Egyptians, in regard to the Soul
and Intelligence of the Universe, from which *our* souls and
intelligences, as well as our life and that of the animals, emanate,
Heaven, Earth, the Sea, the Moon and the Stars, he said, are moved by a
principle of internal life which perpetuates their existence; a great
intelligent soul, that penetrates every part of the vast body of the
Universe, and, mingling with everything, agitates it by an eternal
movement. It is the source of life in all living things. The force which
animates all, emanates from the eternal fire that burns in Heaven. In
the Georgics, Virgil repeats the same doctrine; and that, at the death
of every animal, the life that animated it, part of the universal life,
returns to its Principle and to the source of life that circulates in
the sphere of the Stars.

Servius makes God the active Cause that organizes the elements into
bodies, the vivifying breath or spirit, that, spreading through matter
or the elements, produces and engenders all things. The elements compose
the substance of our bodies: God composes the souls that vivify these
bodies. From it come the instincts of animals, from it their life, he
says: and when they die, that life returns to and
[re-enters](errata.htm#30.md) into the Universal Soul, and their bodies
into Universal Matter.

<span id="page_667">p. 667</span>

Timæus of Locria and Plato his Commentator wrote of the Soul of the
World, developing the doctrine of Pythagoras, who thought, says Cicero,
that God is the Universal Soul, resident everywhere in nature, and of
which our Souls are but emanations. "*God is one*," says Pythagoras, as
cited by Justin Martyr: "He is not, as some think, *without* the world,
but within it, and entire in its entirety. He sees all that *becomes*,
forms all immortal beings, is the author of their powers and
performances, the origin of all things, the Light of Heaven, the
*Father*, the *Intelligence*, the *Soul* of all beings, the Mover of all
spheres."

God, in the view of Pythagoras, was ONE, a single substance, whose
continuous parts extended through all the Universe, without separation,
difference, or inequality, like the soul in the human body. He denied
the doctrine of the spiritualists, who had severed the Divinity from the
Universe, making Him exist apart from the Universe, which thus became no
more than a material work, on which acted the Abstract Cause, a God,
isolated from it. The Ancient Theology did not so separate God from the
Universe. This Eusebius attests, in saying that but a small number of
wise men, like Moses, had sought for God or the Cause of all, outside of
that ALL; while the Philosophers of Egypt and Phœnicia, real authors of
all the old Cosmogonies, had placed the Supreme Cause *in* the Universe
itself, and in its parts, so that, in their view, the world and all its
parts are *in* God.

The World or Universe was thus compared to man: the Principle of Life
that moves it, to that which moves man; the Soul of the World to that of
man. Therefore Pythagoras called man a *microcosm*, or little world, as
possessing in miniature all the qualities found on a great scale in the
Universe; by his reason and intelligence partaking of the Divine Nature:
and by his faculty of changing aliments into other substances, of
growing, and re-producing himself, partaking of elementary Nature. Thus
he made the Universe a great intelligent Being, like man--an immense
Deity, having in itself, what man has in himself, movement, life, and
intelligence, and besides, a perpetuity of existence, which man has not;
and, as having in itself perpetuity of movement and life, therefore the
Supreme Cause of all.

Everywhere extended, this Universal Soul does not, in the view of
Pythagoras, act everywhere equally nor in the same manner. The highest
portion of the Universe, being as it were its head,

<span id="page_668">p. 668</span>

seemed to him its principal seat, and there was the guiding power of the
rest of the world. In the seven concentric spheres is resident an
eternal order, fruit of the intelligence, the Universal Soul that moves,
by a constant and regular progression, the immortal bodies that form the
harmonious system of the heavens.

Manilius says: "I sing the invisible and potent Soul of Nature; that
Divine Substance which, everywhere inherent in Heaven, Earth, and the
Waters of the Ocean, forms the bond that holds together and makes one
all the parts of the vast body of the Universe. It, balancing all
Forces, and harmoniously arranging the varied relations of the many
members of the world, maintains in it the life and regular movement that
agitate it, as a result of the action of the living breath or single
spirit that dwells in all its parts, circulates in all the channels of
universal nature, flashes with rapidity to all its points, and gives to
animated bodies the configurations appropriate to the organization of
each . . . . This eternal Law, this Divine Force, that maintains the
harmony of the world, makes use of the Celestial Signs to organize and
guide the animated creatures that breathe upon the earth; and gives to
each of them the character and habits most appropriate. By the action of
this Force Heaven rules the condition of the Earth and of its fields
cultivated by the husbandman: it gives us or takes from us vegetation
and harvests: it makes the great ocean overpass its limits at the flow,
and retire within them again at the ebbing, of the tide."

Thus it is no longer by means of a poetic fiction only that the heavens
and the earth become animated and personified, and are deemed living
existences, from which other existences proceed. For now they live, with
their own life, a life eternal like their bodies, each gifted with a
life and perhaps a soul, like those of man, a portion of the universal
life and universal soul; and the other bodies that they form, and which
they contain in their bosoms, live only through them and with their
life, as the embryo lives in the bosom of its mother, in consequence and
by means of the life communicated to it, and which the mother ever
maintains by the active power of her own life. Such is the universal
life of the world, reproduced in all the beings which its superior
portion creates in its inferior portion, that is as it were the *matrix*
of the world, or of the beings that the heavens engender in its bosom,

"The soul of the world," says Macrobius, "is nature itself" \[as

<span id="page_669">p. 669</span>

the soul of man is man himself\], "always acting through the celestial
spheres which .it moves, and which but follow the irresistible impulse
it impresses on them. The heavens, the sun, great seat of generative
power, the signs, the stars, and the planets act only with the activity
of the soul of the Universe. From that soul, through them, come all the
variations and changes of sublunary nature, of which the heavens and
celestial bodies are but the secondary causes. The zodiac, with its
signs, is an existence, immortal and divine, organized by the universal
soul, and producing, or gathering in itself, all the varied emanations
of the different powers that make up the nature of the Divinity."

This doctrine, that gave to the heavens and the spheres living souls,
each a portion of the universal soul, was of extreme antiquity. It was
held by the old Sabæans. It was taught by Timæus, Plato, Speusippus,
Iamblichus, Macrobius, Marcus Aurelius, and Pythagoras. When once men
had assigned a soul to the Universe, containing in itself the plenitude
of the animal life of particular beings, and even of the stars, they
soon supposed that soul to be essentially intelligent, and the source of
intelligence of all intelligent beings. Then the Universe became to them
not only animated but intelligent, and of that intelligence the
different parts of nature partook. Each soul was the vehicle, and, as it
were, the envelope of the intelligence that attached itself to it, and
could repose nowhere else. Without a soul there could be no
intelligence; and as there was a universal soul, source of all souls,
the universal soul was gifted with a universal intelligence, source of
all particular intelligences. So the soul of the world contained in
itself the intelligence of the world. All the agents of nature into
which the universal soul entered, received also a portion of its
intelligence, and the Universe, in its totality and in its parts, was
filled with intelligences, that might be regarded as so many emanations
from the sovereign and universal intelligence. Wherever the divine soul
acted as a cause, there also was intelligence; and thus Heaven, the
stars, the elements, and all parts of the Universe, became the seats of
so many divine intelligences. Every minutest portion of the great soul
became a partial intelligence, and the more it was disengaged from gross
matter, the more active and intelligent it was. And all the old adorers
of nature, the theologians, astrologers, and poets, and the most
distinguished philosophers, supposed that the stars were so many
animated and intelligent beings, or

<span id="page_670">p. 670</span>

eternal bodies, active causes of effects here below, whom a principle of
life animated, and whom an intelligence directed, which was but an
emanation from, and a portion of, the universal life and intelligence of
the world.

The Universe itself was regarded as a supremely intelligent being. Such
was the doctrine of Timæus of Locria. The soul of man was part of the
intelligent soul of the Universe, and therefore itself intelligent. His
opinion was that of many other philosophers. Cleanthes, a disciple of
ZENO, regarded the Universe as God, Or as the unproduced and universal
cause of all effects produced. He ascribed a soul and intelligence to
universal nature, and to this intelligent soul, in his view, divinity
belonged. From it the intelligence of man was an emanation, and shared
its divinity. Chrysippus, the most subtle of the Stoics, placed in the
universal reason that forms the soul and intelligence of nature, that
divine force or essence of the Divinity which he assigned to the world
moved by the universal soul that pervades its every part.

An interlocutor in Cicero's work, *De Natura Deorum*, formally argues
that the Universe is necessarily intelligent and wise, because man, an
infinitely small portion of it, is so. Cicero makes the same argument in
his oration for Milo. The physicists came to the same conclusion as the
philosophers. They supposed that movement essentially belonged to the
soul, and the direction of regular and ordered movements to the
intelligence. And, as both movement and order exist in the Universe,
therefore, they held, there must be in it a soul and an intelligence
that role it, and are not to be distinguished from itself; because the
idea of the Universe is but the aggregate of all the particular ideas of
all things that exist.

The argument was, that the Heavens, and the Stars which make part of
them, are *animated*, because they possess a portion of the Universal
Soul: they are *intelligent* beings, because that Universal Soul, part
whereof they possess, is supremely intelligent; and they share
*Divinity* with Universal Nature, because Divinity resides in the
Universal Soul and Intelligence which move and rule the world, and of
each of which they hold a share. By this process of logic, the
interlocutor in Cicero assigned Divinity to the Stars, as animated
beings gifted with sensibility and intelligence, and composed of the
noblest and purest portions of the ethereal substance, unmixed with
matter of an alien nature, and

<span id="page_671">p. 671</span>

essentially containing light and heat. Hence he concluded them to be so
many gods, of an intelligence superior to that of other existences,
corresponding to the lofty height in which they moved with such perfect
regularity and admirable harmony, with a movement spontaneous and free.
Hence he made them "Gods," active, eternal, and intelligent "Causes";
and peopled the realm of Heaven with a host of Eternal Intelligences,
celestial Genii or Angels, sharing the universal Divinity, and
associated with it in the administration of the Universe, and the
dominion exercised over sublunary nature and man.

*We* make the motive-force of the planets to be a mechanical law, which
we explain by the combination of two forces, the centripetal and
centrifugal, whose *origin* we cannot demonstrate, but whose *force* we
can calculate. The ancients regarded them as moved by an intelligent
force that had its origin in the first and universal Intelligence. Is it
so certain, after all, that we are any nearer the truth than they were;
or that we know what our "centripetal and centrifugal forces" *mean*;
for what *is* a *force*? With us, the entire Deity acts upon and moves
each planet, as He does the sap that circulates in the little blade of
grass, and in the particles of blood in the tiny veins of the invisible
rotifer. With the Ancients, the Deity of each Star was but a portion of
the Universal God, the Soul of Nature. Each Star and Planet, with them,
was moved of *itself*, and directed by *its own* special intelligence.
And this opinion of Achilles Tatius, Diodorus, Chrysippus, Aristotle,
Plato, Heraclides of Pontus, Theophrastus, Simplicius, Macrobius, and
Proclus, that in each Star there is an immortal Soul and Intelligence,
part of the Universal Soul and Intelligence of the Whole,--this opinion
of Orpheus, Plotinus, and the Stoics, was in reality, that of many
Christian philosophers. For Origen held the same opinion; and Augustin
held that every visible thing in the world was superintended by an
[Angelic](errata.htm#31.md) Power: and Cosma, the Monk, believed that every
Star was under the guidance of an Angel; and the author of the
Octateuch, written in the time of the Emperor Justin, says that they are
moved by the impulse communicated to them by Angels stationed above the
firmament. Whether the stars were animated beings, was a question that
Christian antiquity did not decide. Many of the Christian doctors
believed they were. Saint Augustin hesitates, Saint Jerome doubts, if
Solomon did not assign souls to the Stars. Saint

<span id="page_672">p. 672</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Ambrose does not
doubt they *have* souls; and Pamphilus says that many of the Church
believe they are reasonable beings, while many think otherwise, but that
neither one nor the other opinion is heretical.

Thus the Ancient Thought, earnest and sincere, wrought out the idea of a
Soul *inherent* in the Universe and in its several parts. The next step
was to *separate* that Soul from the Universe, and give to it an
external and independent existence and personality; still omnipresent,
in every inch of space and in every particle of matter, and yet not a
part of Nature, but its Cause and its Creator. This is the middle ground
between the two doctrines, of Pantheism (or that all is God, and God is
*in* all and is all), on the one side, and Atheism (or that all is
nature, and there is no other God), on the other; which doctrines, after
all, when reduced to their simplest terms, seem to be the same.

We complacently congratulate ourselves on our recognition of a
*personal* God, as being the conception most suited to human sympathies,
and exempt from the mystifications of Pantheism. But the Divinity
remains still a mystery, notwithstanding all the devices which
symbolism, either from the organic or inorganic creation, can supply;
and personification is itself a symbol, liable to misapprehension as
much as, if not more so than, any other, since it is apt to degenerate
into a mere reflection of our own infirmities; and hence any affirmative
idea or conception that we can, in our own minds, picture of the Deity,
must needs be infinitely inadequate.

The spirit of the Vedas (or sacred Indian Books, of great antiquity), as
understood by their earliest as well as most recent expositors, is
decidedly a pantheistic monotheism--one God, and He all in all; the many
divinities, numerous as the prayers ad-dressed to them, being resolvable
into the titles and attributes of a few, and ultimately into THE ONE.
The machinery of personification was understood to have been
unconsciously assumed as a mere expedient to supply the deficiencies of
language; and the Mimansa justly considered itself as only interpreting
the true meaning of the Mantras, when it proclaimed that, in the
beginning, "Nothing was but Mind, the Creative Thought of Him which
existed alone from the beginning, and breathed without afflation." The
idea suggested in the Mantras is dogmatically asserted and developed in
the Upanischadas. The Vedanta philosophy,

<span id="page_673">p. 673</span>

assuming the mystery of the "ONE IN MANY" as the fundamental article of
faith, maintained not only the Divine Unity, but the identity of matter
and spirit. The unity which it advocates is that of mind. Mind is the
Universal Element, the One God, the Great Soul, Mahaatma. He is the
material as well as efficient cause, and the world is a texture of which
he is both the web and the weaver. He is the Macrocosmos, the universal
organism called Pooroosha, of which Fire, Air, and Sun are only the
chief members. His head is light, his eyes the sun and moon, his breath
the wind, his voice the opened Vedas. All proceeds from Brahm, like the
web from the spider and the grass from the earth.

Yet it is only the impossibility of expressing in language the
origination of matter from spirit, which gives to Hindu philosophy the
appearance of materialism. Formless Himself, the Deity is present in all
forms. His glory is displayed in the Universe as the image of the sun in
water, which is, yet is not, the luminary itself. All maternal agency
and appearance, the subjective world, are to a great extent phantasms,
the notional representations of ignorance. They occupy, however, a
middle ground between reality and non-reality; they are unreal, because
nothing exists but Brahm; yet in some degree real, inasmuch as they
constitute an outward manifestation of him. They are a self-induced
hypostasis of the Deity, under which He *presents to Himself* the whole
of animate and inanimate Nature, the actuality of the moment, the
diversified *appearances* which successively invest the one Pantheistic
Spirit.

The great aim of reason is to generalize; to discover unity in
multiplicity, order in apparent confusion; to separate from the
accidental and the transitory, the stable and universal. In the
contemplation of Nature, and the vague, but almost intuitive perception
of a general uniformity of plan among endless varieties of operation and
form, arise those solemn and reverential feelings, which, if accompanied
by intellectual activity, may eventually ripen into philosophy.

Consciousness of self and of personal identity is co-existent with our
existence. We cannot conceive of mental existence without it. It is not
the work of reflection nor of logic, nor the result of observation,
experiment, and experience. It is a gift from God, like instinct; and
that consciousness of a thinking soul which is

<span id="page_674">p. 674</span>

really the person that we are, and other than our body, is the best and
most solid proof of the soul's existence. We have the same consciousness
of a Power on which we are dependent; which we can *define* and form an
idea or picture of, as little as we can of the soul, and yet which we
*feel*, and therefore *know*, exists. True and correct ideas of that
Power, of the Absolute Existence from which all proceeds, we cannot
trace; if by true and correct we mean *adequate* ideas; for of such we
are not, with our limited faculties, capable. And ideas of His nature,
so far correct as we are capable of entertaining, can only be attained
either by direct inspiration or by the investigations of philosophy.

The idea of the universal preceded the recognition of any system for its
explanation. It was *felt* rather than understood; and it was long
before the grand conception on which all philosophy rests received
through deliberate investigation that analytical development which might
properly entitle it to the name. The sentiment, when first observed by
the self-conscious mind, was, says Plato, "a Divine gift, communicated
to mankind by some Prometheus, or by those ancients who lived nearer to
the gods than our degenerate selves." The mind deduced from its first
experiences the notion of a general Cause or Antecedent, to which it
shortly gave a name and personified it. This was the statement of a
theorem, obscure in proportion to its generality. *It explained all
things but itself*. It was *a true* cause, but an *incomprehensible*
one. Ages had to pass before the nature of the theorem could be rightly
appreciated, and before men, acknowledging the First Cause to be an
object of faith rather than science, were contented to confine their
researches to those nearer relations of existence and succession, which
are really within the reach of their faculties. At first, and for a long
time, the intellect deserted the real for a hastily-formed ideal world,
and the imagination usurped the place of reason, in attempting to put a
construction on the most general and inadequate of conceptions, by
transmuting its symbols into realities, and by substantializing it under
a thousand arbitrary forms.

In poetry, the idea of Divine unity became, as in Nature, obscured by a
multifarious symbolism; and the notionalities of transcendental
philosophy reposed on views of nature scarcely more profound than those
of the earliest symbolists. Yet the idea of unity was rather obscured
than extinguished; and Xenophanes

<span id="page_675">p. 675</span>

appeared as an enemy of Homer, only because he more emphatically
insisted on the monotheistic element, which, in poetry, has been
comparatively overlooked. The first philosophy reasserted the unity
which poetry had lost; but being unequal to investigate its nature, it
again resigned it to the world of approximate sensations, and became
bewildered in materialism, considering the conceptional whole or First
Element as some refinement of matter, unchangeable in its essence,
though subject to mutations of quality and form in an eternal succession
of seeming decay and regeneration; comparing it to water, air, or fire,
as each endeavored to refine on the doctrine of his predecessor, or was
influenced by a different class of theological traditions.

In the philosophical systems, the Divine Activity, divided by the poets
and by popular belief among a race of personifications, in whom the idea
of descent replaced that of cause, or of pantheistic evolution, was
restored, without subdivision or reservation, to nature as a whole; at
first as a mechanical *force* or *life*; afterward as an all-pervading
*soul* or inherent *thought*; and lastly as an external directing
*Intelligence*.

The Ionian revival of pantheism was materialistic. The Moving Force was
inseparable from a material element, a subtle yet visible ingredient.
Under the form of *air* or *fire*, the principle of life was associated
with the most obvious material machinery of nature. Everything, it was
said, is alive and full of gods. The wonders of the volcano, the magnet,
the ebb and flow of the tide, were vital indications, the breathing or
moving of the Great World-Animal. The imperceptible. ether of Anaximenes
had no *positive* quality beyond the atmospheric air with which it was
easily confused: and even the "Infinite" of Anaximander, though free of
the conditions of quality or quantity, was only an ideal chaos, relieved
of its coarseness by negations. It was the illimitable storehouse or
Pleroma, out of which is evolved the endless circle of phenomenal
change. A moving Force was recognized in, but not clearly distinguished
*from*, the material. Space, Time, Figure, and Number, and other common
forms or properties, which exist only as *attributes*, were treated as
*substances*, or at least as making a substantial connection between the
objects to which they belong: and all the conditions of material
existence were supposed to have been evolved out of the Pythagorean
Monad.

The Eleatic philosophers treated conceptions not only as

<span id="page_676">p. 676</span>

entities, but as the only entities, alone possessing the stability and
certainty and reality vainly sought among phenomena. The only reality
was Thought. "All *real* existence," they said, "is mental existence;
non-existence, being inconceivable, is therefore impossible; existence
fills up the whole range of thought, and is inseparable from its
exercise; thought and its object are one."

Xenophanes used ambiguous language, applicable to the material as well
as to the mental, and exclusively appropriate to neither. In other
words, he availed himself of material imagery to illustrate an
indefinite meaning. In announcing the universal being, he appealed to
the heavens as the visible manifestation, calling it *spherical*, a term
borrowed from the material world. He said that God was neither moved nor
unmoved, limited nor unlimited. He did not even attempt to express
clearly what cannot be conceived clearly; admitting, says Simplicius,
that such speculations were above physics. Parmenides employed similar
expedients, comparing his metaphysical Deity to a sphere, or to heat, an
aggregate or a continuity, and so involuntarily withdrawing its nominal
attributes.

The Atomic school, dividing the All into Matter and Force, deemed matter
unchangeable in its ultimate constitution, though infinitely variable in
its resultant forms. They made all variety proceed from the varied
combinations of atoms; but they required no mover nor director of the
atoms external to themselves; no universal Reason; but a Mechanical
Eternal *Necessity*, like that of the Poets. Still it is doubtful
whether there ever was a time when reason could be said to be entirely
asleep, a stranger to its own existence, notwithstanding this apparent
materialism. The earliest contemplation of the external world, which
brings it into an imagined association with ourselves, assigns, either
to its whole or its parts, the sensation and volition which belong to
our own souls.

Anaxagoras admitted the existence of ultimate elementary particles, as
Empedocles did, from the combinations whereof all material phenomena
resulted. But he asserted the Moving Force to be Mind; and yet, though
he clearly saw the impossibility of advancing by illustration or
definition beyond a reasonable faith, or a simple negation of
materiality, yet he could not wholly desist from the endeavor to
illustrate the nature of this non-matter or mind, by symbols drawn from
those physical considerations which

<span id="page_677">p. 677</span>

decided him in placing it in a separate category. Whether as human
reason, or as the regulating Principle in nature, he held it different
from all other things in character and effect, and that therefore it
must necessarily differ in its essential constitution. It was neither
Matter, nor a Force conjoined with matter, or homogeneous with it, but
independent and generically distinct, especially in this, that, being
the source of all motion, separation, and cognition, it is something
entirely unique, pure, and unmixed; and so, being unhindered by any
interfering influence limiting its independence of individual action, it
has Supreme Empire over all things, over the vortex of worlds as well as
over all that live in them. It is most penetrating and powerful, mixing
with other things, though no other thing mixes with it; exercises
universal control and cognition, and includes the *Necessity* of the
Poets, as well as the independent power of thought which we exercise
within ourselves. In short, it is the self-conscious power of thought
extended to the Universe, and exalted into the Supreme External Mind
which sees, knows, and directs all things.

Thus Pantheism and Materialism were both avoided; and matter, though as
infinitely varied as the senses represent it, was held in a bond of
unity transferred to a ruling power apart from it. That Power could not
be Prime Mover, if it were itself moved; nor All-Governing, if not apart
from the things it governs. If the arranging Principle were *inherent*
in matter, it would have been impossible to account for the existence of
a chaos: if something *external*, then the old Ionian doctrine of a
"beginning" became more easily conceivable, as being the epoch at which
the Arranging Intelligence commenced its operations.

But this grand idea of an all-governing independent mind involved
difficulties which proved insuperable; because it gave to matter, in the
form of chaos, an independent and eternal self-existence, and so
introduced a dualism of mind and matter. In the Mind or Intelligence,
Anaxagoras included not only life and motion, but the moral principles
of the noble and good; and probably used the term on account of the
popular misapplication of the word "God," and as being less liable to
misconstruction, and more specifically marking his idea. His
"Intelligence" principle remained practically liable to many of the same
defects as the "Necessity" of the poets. It was the presentiment of a
great idea, which it was for the time impossible to explain or follow
out.

<span id="page_678">p. 678</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> It was not yet
intelligible, nor was even the road opened through which it might be
approached.

Mind cannot advance in metaphysics beyond self-deification. In
attempting to go further, it only enacts the apotheosis of its own
subtle conceptions, and so sinks below the simpler ground already taken.
The realities which Plato could not recognize in phenomena, he
discovered within his own mind, and as unhesitatingly as the old
Theosophists installed its creations among the gods. He, like most
philosophers after Anaxagoras, made the Supreme Being to be
Intelligence; but in other respects left His nature undefined, or rather
indefinite through the variety of definitions, a conception vaguely
floating between Theism and Pan-theism. Though deprecating the
demoralizing tendencies of poetry, he was too wise to attempt to replace
them by other representations of a positive kind. He justly says, that
spiritual things can be made intelligible only through figures; and the
forms of allegorical expression which, in a rude age, had been adopted
unconsciously, were designedly chosen by the philosopher as the most
appropriate vehicles for theological ideas.

As the devices of symbolism were gradually stripped away, in order, if
possible, to reach the fundamental conception, the religious feeling
habitually connected with it seemed to evaporate under the process. And
yet the advocates of Monotheism, Xenophanes and Heraclitus, declaimed
only against the making of gods in human form. They did not attempt to
strip nature of its divinity, but rather to recall religious
contemplation from an exploded symbolism to a purer one. They continued
the veneration which, in the background of poetry, has been maintained
for Sun and Stars, the Fire or Ether. Socrates prostrated himself before
the rising luminary; and the eternal spheres, which seem to have shared
the religious homage of Xenophanes, retained a secondary and qualified
Divinity in the Schools of the Peripatetics and Stoics.

The unseen being or beings revealed only to the Intellect became the
theme of philosophy; and their more ancient symbols, if not openly
discredited, were passed over with evasive generality, as beings
respecting whose problematical existence we must be "content with what
has been reported by those ancients, who, assuming to be their
descendants, must therefore be supposed to have been well acquainted
with their own ancestors and family

<span id="page_679">p. 679</span>

connections." And the Theism of Anaxagoras was still more decidedly
subversive, not only of Mythology, but of the whole religion of outward
nature; it being an appeal from the world without, to the consciousness
of spiritual dignity within man.

In the doctrines of Aristotle, the world moves on uninterruptedly,
always changing, yet ever the same, like Time, the Eternal Now, knowing
neither repose nor death. There is a principle which makes good the
failure of *identity*, by multiplying *resemblances*; the destruction of
the *individual* by an eternal renewal of the *form* in which matter is
manifested. This regular eternal *movement* implies an Eternal Mover;
not an inert Eternity, such as the Platonic *Eidos*, but one always
*acting*, His *essence* being *to act*, for otherwise he might *never*
have acted, and the existence of the world would be an accident; for
what should have, in that case, decided Him to act, after long
inactivity? Nor can He be partly *in act* and partly *potential*, that
is, quiescent and undetermined to act or not to act, for even in that
case motion would not be eternal, but contingent and precarious. He is
therefore *wholly in act*, a pure, untiring activity, and for the sane
reasons wholly immaterial. Thus Aristotle avoided the idea that God was
inactive and self-contemplative for an eternity, and then for some
unknown reason, or by some unknown motive, commenced to act outwardly
and produce; but he incurred the opposite hazard, of making the result
of His action, matter and the Universe, be co-existent with Himself; or,
in other words, of denying that there was any time when His outward
action *commenced*.

The First Cause, he said, unmoved, moves all. Act was *first*, and the
Universe has existed forever; one persistent cause directing its
continuity. The *unity* of the First Mover follows from His
immateriality. If He were not Himself unmoved, the series of motions and
causes of motion would be infinite. Unmoved, therefore, and unchangeable
Himself, all movement, even that in space, is caused by Him: He is
necessary: He cannot be otherwise than as He is; and it is only through
the necessity of His being that we can account for those necessary
eternal relations which make a science of Being possible. Thus Aristotle
leaned to a seemingly personal God; not a Being of parts and passions,
like the God of the Hebrews, or that of the mass even of educated men in
our own day, but a Substantial Head of all the categories of being, an
Individuality of Intelligence, the dogma of Anaxagoras revived

<span id="page_680">p. 680</span>

out of a more elaborate and profound analysis of Nature; something like
that living unambiguous Principle which the old poets, in advance of the
materialistic cosmogonists from Night and Chaos, had discovered in
Ouranos or Zeus. Soon, however, the vision of personality is withdrawn,
and we reach that culminating point of thought where the real blends
with the ideal; where moral action and objective thought (that is,
thought exercised as to anything outside of itself), as well as the
material body, are excluded; and where the divine action in the world
retains its veil of impenetrable mystery, and to the utmost ingenuity of
research presents but a contradiction. At this extreme, the series of
efficient causes resolves itself into the Final Cause. That which moves,
itself *un*moved, can only be the immobility of Thought or Form. God is
both formal, efficient, and final cause; the One Form comprising all
forms, the one good including all good, the goal of the longing of the
University, moving the world as the object of love or rational desire
moves the individual. He is the internal or self-realized Final Cause,
having no end beyond Himself. He is no moral agent; for if He were, He
would be but an instrument for producing something still higher and
greater. One sort of act only, activity of mind or thought, can be
assigned to Him who is at once all act yet all repose. What we call our
highest pleasure, which distinguishes wakefulness and sensation, and
which gives a reflected charm to hope and memory, is with Him perpetual.
His existence is unbroken enjoyment of that which is most excellent but
only temporary with us. The divine quality of active and yet tranquil
self-contemplation characterizing intelligence, is pre-eminently
possessed by the divine mind; His thought, which is His existence,
being, unlike ours, unconditional and wholly act. If He can receive any
gratification or enjoyment from that which exists beyond Himself, He can
also be displeased and pained with it, and then He would be an imperfect
being. To suppose pleasure experienced by Him from anything outward,
supposes an insufficient *prior* enjoyment and happiness, and a sort of
dependency. Man's Good is beyond himself; not so God's. The eternal act
which produces the world's life is the eternal desire of good. The
object of the Absolute Thought is the Absolute Good. Nature is all
movement, and Thought all repose. In contemplating that absolute good,
the Finality can contemplate only itself; and thus, all material
interference being excluded, the distinction of

<span id="page_681">p. 681</span>

subject and object vanishes in complete identification, and the Divine
Thought is "the thinking of thought." The energy of mind is life, and
God is that energy in its purity and perfection. He is therefore life
itself, eternal and perfect; and this sums up all that is meant by the
term "God." And yet, after all this transcendentalism, the very essence
of thought consists in its mobility and power of transference from
object to object; and we can conceive of no thought, without an object
beyond itself, about which to think, or of any activity in mere
self-contemplation, without out-ward act, movement, or manifestation.

Plato endeavors to show how the Divine Principle of Good becomes
realized in Nature: Aristotle's system is a vast analogical induction to
prove how all Nature tends toward a final good. Plato considered Soul as
a principle of movement, and made his Deity realize, that is, turn into
realities, his ideas as a free, intelligent Force. Aristotle, for whom
Soul is the motionless centre from which motion radiates, and to which
it converges, conceives a correspondingly unmoved God. The Deity of
Plato creates, superintends, and rejoices in the universal joy of, His
creatures. That of Aristotle is the perfection of man's intellectual
activity extended to the Universe. When he makes the Deity to be an
eternal act of self-contemplation, the world is not excluded from His
cognizance, for He contemplates it within Himself. Apart from and beyond
the world, He yet mysteriously intermingles with it. He is universal as
well as individual; His agency is necessary and general, yet also makes
the real and the good of the particular.

When Plato had given to the unformed world the animal life of the
Ionians, and added to that the Anaxagorean Intelligence, overruling the
wild principle of Necessity; and when to Intelligence was added
Beneficence; and the dread Wardours, Force and Strength, were made
subordinate to Mildness and Goodness, it seemed as if a further advance
were impossible, and that the Deny could not be more than The Wise and
The Good.

But the contemplation of the Good implies that of its opposite, Evil.
When God is held to be "The Good," it is not because Evil is unknown,
but because it is designedly excluded from His attributes. But if Evil
be a separate and independent existence, how would it fare with His
prerogative of Unity and Supremacy? To meet this dilemma, it remained
only to fall back on something more or less akin to the vagueness of
antiquity; to make a virtual

<span id="page_682">p. 682</span>

confession of ignorance, to deny the ultimate reality of evil, like
Plato and Aristotle, or, with Speusippus, the eternity of its
antithetical existence, to surmise that it is only one of those notions
which are indeed provisionally indispensable in a condition of finite
knowledge, but of which so many have been already discredited by the
advance of philosophy; to revert, in short, to the original conception
of "The Absolute," or of a single Being, in whom all mysteries are
explained, and before whom the disturbing principle is reduced to a mere
turbid spot on the ocean of Eternity, which to the eye of faith may be
said no longer to exist.

But the absolute is nearly allied to the non-existent. Matter and evil
obtruded themselves too constantly and convincingly to he confuted or
cancelled by subtleties of Logic. It is in vain to attempt to merge the
world in God, while the world of experience exhibits contrariety,
imperfection, and mutability, instead of the immutability of its source.
Philosophy was but another name for uncertainty; and after the mind had
successively deified Nature and its own conceptions, without any
practical result but toilsome occupation; when the reality it sought,
without or within, seemed ever to elude its grasp, the intellect,
baffled in its higher flights, sought advantage and repose in aiming at
truth of a lower but more applicable kind.

The Deity of Plato is a Being proportioned to human sympathies; the
Father of the World, as well as its Creator; the author of good only,
not of evil. "Envy," he says, "is far removed from celestial beings, and
man, if willing, and braced for the effort, is permitted to aspire to a
communion with the solemn troops and sweet societies of Heaven. God is
the Idea or Essence of Goodness, the Good itself \[τὸ ἀγαθόν\]; in
goodness, He created the World, and gave to it the greatest perfection
of which it was susceptible; making it, as far as possible, an image of
Himself. The sublime type of all excellence is an object not only of
veneration but love." The Sages of old had already intimated in enigmas
that God is the Author of Good; that like the Sun in Heaven, or
Æsculapius on earth, He is "Healer," "Saviour," and "Redeemer," the
destroyer and averter of Evil, ever healing the mischiefs inflicted by
Herè, the wanton or irrational power of nature.

Plato only asserts with more distinctness the dogma of antiquity when he
recognizes LOVE as the highest and most beneficent of gods, who gives to
nature the invigorating energy restored by the

<span id="page_683">p. 683</span>

art of medicine to the body; since Love is emphatically the physician of
the Universe, the Æsculapius to whom Socrates wished to sacrifice in the
hour of his death.

A figurative idea, adopted from familiar imagery, gave that endearing
aspect to the divine connection with the Universe which had commanded
the earliest assent of the sentiments, until, rising in refinement with
the progress of mental cultivation, it ultimately established itself as
firmly in the deliberate approbation of the understanding, as it had
ever responded to the sympathies. Even the rude Scythians, Bithynians,
and Scandinavians, called God their "Father"; all nations traced their
ancestry more or less directly to Heaven. The Hyperborean Olen, one of
the oldest symbols of the religious antiquity of Greece, made Love the
First-born of Nature. Who will venture to pronounce at what time God was
first worthily and truly honored, or when man first began to feel aright
the mute eloquence of nature? In the obscure physics of the mystical
Theologers who preceded Greek philosophy, Love was the Great First Cause
and Parent of the Universe. "Zeus," says Proclus, "when entering upon
the work of creation, changed Himself into the form of Love: and He
brought forward Aphroditè, the principle of Unity and Universal Harmony,
to display her light to all. In the depths of His mysterious being, He
contains the principle of love within Himself; in Him creative wisdom
and blessed love are united."

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                    "From the first

</div>

The speculators of the venerable East, who had conceived the idea of an
Eternal Being superior to all affection and change, in his own
sufficiency enjoying a plenitude of serene and independent bliss, were
led to inquire into the apparently inconsistent fact of the creation of
the world. Why, they asked, did He, who required nothing external to
Himself to complete His already-existing Perfection, come forth out of
His unrevealed and perfect existence, and become incorporated in the
vicissitudes of nature? The solution of the difficulty was Love. The
Great Being beheld the beauty of His own conception, which dwelt with
Him alone from the beginning, Maia, or Nature's loveliness, at once the
germ

<span id="page_684">p. 684</span>

of passion and the source of worlds. Love became the universal parent,
when the Deity, before remote and inscrutable, became ideally separated
into the loving and the beloved.

And here again recurs the ancient difficulty; that, at whatever early
period this creation occurred, an eternity had previously elapsed,
during which God, dwelling alone in His unimpeached unity, had no object
for His love; and that the very word implies to us an existing object
toward which the love is directed; so that we cannot conceive of love in
the absence of any object to be loved; and therefore we again return to
this point, that if love is of God's essence, and He is unchangeable,
the same necessity of His nature, supposed to have caused creation, must
ever have made His existence without an object to love impossible: and
so that the Universe must have been co-existent with Himself.

The questions how and why evil exists in the Universe: how its existence
is to be reconciled with the admitted wisdom and goodness and
omnipotence of God; and how far man is a free agent, or controlled by an
inexorable necessity or destiny, have two sides. On one, they are
questions as to the qualities and attributes of Got; for we must infer
His moral nature from His mode of governing the Universe, and they ever
enter into any consideration of His intellectual nature: and on the
other, they directly concern the moral responsibility, and therefore the
destiny, of man. All-important, therefore, in both points of view, they
have been much discussed in all ages of the world, and have no doubt
urged men, more than all other questions have, to endeavor to fathom the
profound mysteries of the Nature and the mode of Existence and action of
an incomprehensible God.

And, with these, still another question also presents itself: whether
the Deity governs the Universe by fixed and unalterable laws, or by
special Providences and interferences, so that He may be induced to
change His course and the results of human or material action, by prayer
and supplication.

God alone is all-powerful; but the human soul has in all ages asserted
its claim to be considered as part of the Divine. "The purity of the
spirit," says Van Helmont, "is shown through energy and efficaciousness
of will. God, by the agency of an infinite will, created the Universe,
and the same sort of power in an inferior degree, limited more or less
by external hindrances, exists in all spiritual beings." The higher we
ascend in antiquity, the more

<span id="page_685">p. 685</span>

does prayer take the form of incantation; and that form it still in a
great degree retains, since the rites of public worship are generally
considered not merely as an expression of trust or reverence, as real
spiritual acts, the effect of which is looked for only within the mind
of the worshipper, but as acts from which some direct outward result is
anticipated, the attainment of some desired object, of health or wealth,
of supernatural gifts for body or soul, of exemption from danger, or
vengeance upon enemies. Prayer was able to change the purposes of
Heaven, and to make the Devs tremble under the abyss. It exercised a
compulsory influence over the gods. It promoted the magnetic sympathy of
spirit with spirit; and the Hindu\_ and Persian liturgies, addressed not
only to the Deity Himself, but to His diversified manifestations, were
considered wholesome and necessary iterations of the living or creative
Word which at first effectuated the divine will, and which from instant
to instant supports the universal frame by its eternal repetition.

In the narrative of the Fall we have the Hebrew mode of explaining the
great moral mystery, the origin of evil and the apparent estrangement
from Heaven; and a similar idea, variously modified, obtained in all the
ancient creeds. Everywhere, man had at the beginning been innocent and
happy, and had lapsed, by temptation and his own weakness, from his
first estate. Thus was accounted for the presumed connection of increase
of knowledge with increase of misery, and, in particular, the great
penalty of death was reconciled with Divine Justice. Subordinate to
these greater points were the questions, Why is the earth covered with
thorns and weeds? whence the origin of clothing, of sexual shame and
passion? whence the infliction of labor, and how to justify the degraded
condition of woman in the East, or account for the loathing so generally
felt toward the Serpent Tribe?

The hypothesis of a fall, required under some of its modifications in
all systems, to account for the apparent imperfection in the work of a
Perfect Being, was, in Eastern philosophy, the unavoidable accompaniment
and condition of limited or individual existence; since the Soul,
considered as a fragment of the Universal Mind, might be said to have
lapsed from its pre-eminence when parted from its source, and ceasing to
form part of integral perfection. The theory of its reunion was
correspondent to the assumed cause of its degradation. To reach its
prior condition,

<span id="page_686">p. 686</span>

its individuality must cease; it must be emancipated by re-absorption
into the Infinite, the consummation of all things in God, to be promoted
by human effort in spiritual meditation or self-mortification, and
completed in the magical transformation of death.

And as man had fallen, so it was held that the Angels of Evil had, from
their first estate, to which, like men, they were, in God's good time,
to be restored, and the reign of evil was then to cease forever. To this
great result all the Ancient Theologies point; and thus they all
endeavored to reconcile the existence of Sin and Evil with the perfect
and undeniable wisdom and beneficence of God.

With man's exercise of thought are inseparably connected freedom and
responsibility. Man assumes his proper rank as a moral agent, when with
a sense of the limitations of his nature arise the consciousness of
freedom, and of the obligations accompanying its exercise, the sense of
duty and of the capacity to perform it. To suppose that man ever
imagined himself not to be a free agent until he had argued himself into
that belief, would be to suppose that he was in that below the brutes;
for he, like them, is *conscious* of his freedom to act. Experience
alone teaches him that this freedom of action is limited and controlled;
and when what is outward to him restrains and limits this freedom of
action, he instinctively rebels against it as a wrong. The rule of duty
and the materials of experience are derived from an acquaintance with
the conditions of the external world, in which the faculties are
exerted; and thus the problem of man involves those of Nature and God.
Our freedom, we learn by experience, is determined by an agency external
to us; our happiness is intimately dependent on the relations of the
outward World, and on the moral character of its Ruler.

Then at once arises this problem: The God of Nature must be One, and His
character cannot be suspected to be other than good. Whence, then, came
the evil, the consciousness of which must invariably have preceded or
accompanied man's moral development? On this subject human opinion has
ebbed and flowed between two contradictory extremes, one of which seems
inconsistent with God's Omnipotence, and the other with His beneficence.
If God, it was said, is perfectly wise and good, evil must arise from
some *independent* and *hostile* principle: if, on the other hand, all
agencies are subordinate to One, it is difficult, if evil does indeed
exist,

<span id="page_687">p. 687</span>

if there is any such thing as Evil, to avoid the impiety of making God
the Author of it.

The recognition of a moral and physical dualism in nature was adverse to
the doctrine of Divine Unity. Many of the Ancients thought it absurd to
imagine one Supreme Being, like Homer's Jove, distributing good and evil
out of two urns. They therefore substituted, as we have seen, the
doctrine of two distinct and eternal principles; some making the cause
of evil to be the inherent imperfection of matter and the flesh, without
explaining how God was not the cause of that; while others personified
the required agency, and fancifully invented an Evil Principle, the
question of whose origin indeed involved all the difficulty of the
original problem, but whose existence, if once taken for granted, was
sufficient as a popular solution of the mystery; the difficulty being
supposed no longer to exist when pushed a step further off, as the
difficulty of conceiving the world upheld by an elephant was supposed to
be got rid of when it was said that the elephant was supported by a
tortoise.

The simpler, and probably the older, notion, treated the one only God as
the Author of all things. "I form the light," says Jehovah, "and create
darkness; I cause prosperity and create evil; I, the Lord, do all these
things." "All mankind," says Maximus Tyrius, "are agreed that there
exists one only Universal King and Father, and that the many gods are
His Children." There is nothing improbable in the supposition that the
primitive idea was that there was but one God. A vague sense of Nature's
Unity, blended with a dim perception of an all-pervading Spiritual
Essence, has been remarked among the earliest manifestations of the
Human Mind. Everywhere it was the dim remembrance, uncertain and
indefinite, of the original truth taught by God to the first men.

The Deity of the Old Testament is everywhere represented as the direct
author of Evil, commissioning evil and lying spirits to men, hardening
the heart of Pharaoh, and visiting the iniquity of the individual sinner
on the whole people. The rude conception of sternness predominating over
mercy in the Deity, can alone account for the human sacrifices,
purposed, if not executed, by Abraham and Jephthah. It has not been
uncommon, in any age or country of the world, for men to recognize the
existence of one God, without forming any becoming estimate of His
dignity. The

<span id="page_688">p. 688</span>

causes of both good and ill are referred to a mysterious centre, to
which each assigns such attributes as correspond with his own intellect
and advance in civilization. Hence the assignment to the Deity of the
feelings of envy and jealousy. Hence the provocation given by the
healing skill of Æsculapius and the humane theft of fire by Prometheus.
The very spirit of Nature, personified in Orpheus, Tantalus, or Phineus
was supposed to have been killed, confined, or blinded, for having too
freely divulged the Divine Mysteries to mankind. This Divine Envy still
exists in a modified form, and varies according to circumstances. In
Hesiod it appears in the lowest type of human malignity. In the God of
Moses, it is jealousy of the infringement of the autocratic power, the
check to political treason; and even the penalties denounced for
worshipping other gods often seem dictated rather by a jealous regard
for His own greatness in Deity, than by the immorality and degraded
nature of the worship itself. In Herodotus and other writers it assumes
a more philosophical shape, as a strict adherence to a moral equilibrium
in the government of the world, in the punishment of pride, arrogance,
and insolent pretension.

God acts providentially in Nature by regular and universal laws, by
constant modes of operation; and so takes care of material things
without violating their constitution, acting always according to the
nature of the things which He has made. It is a fact of observation
that, in the material and unconscious world, He works *by* its
materiality and unconsciousness, not against them; in the animal world,
*by* its animality and partial consciousness, not against them. So in
the providential government of the world, He acts by regular and
universal laws, and constant modes of operation; and so takes care of
human things without violating their constitution, acting always
according to the human nature of man, not against if, working in the
human world by means of man's consciousness and partial freedom, not
against them.

God acts by general laws for general purposes. The attraction of
gravitation is a good thing, for it keeps the world together; and if the
tower of Siloam, thereby falling to the ground, slays eighteen men of
Jerusalem, that number is too small to think of, considering the myriad
millions who are upheld by the same law. It could not well be repealed
for *their* sake, and to hold up that tower; nor could it remain in
force, and the tower stand.

It is difficult to conceive of a Perfect *Will* without confounding

<span id="page_689">p. 689</span>

it with something like mechanism; since language has no name for that
combination of the Inexorable with the Moral, which the old poets
personified separately in Ananke or Eimarmene and Zeus. How combine
understandingly the Perfect Freedom of the Supreme and All-Sovereign
Will of God with the inflexible necessity, as part of His Essence, that
He should and must continue to be, in all His great attributes, of
justice and mercy for example, what He is now and always has been, and
with the impossibility of His changing His nature and becoming unjust,
merciless, cruel, fickle, or of His repealing the great moral laws which
make crime wrong and the practice of virtue right?

For all that we familiarly know of Free-Will is that capricious exercise
of it which we experience in ourselves and other men; and therefore the
notion of Supreme Will, still guided by Infallible Law, even if that law
be self-imposed, is always in danger of being either stripped of the
essential quality of Freedom, or degraded under the ill-name of
Necessity to something of even less moral and intellectual dignity than
the fluctuating course of human operations.

It is not until we elevate the idea of law above that of partiality or
tyranny, that we discover that the self-imposed limitations of the
Supreme Cause, constituting an array of certain alternatives, regulating
moral choice, are the very sources and safeguards of human freedom; and
the doubt recurs, whether we do not set a law above God Himself; or
whether laws self-imposed may not be self-repealed: and if not, what
power prevents it.

The Zeus of Homer, like that of Hesiod, is an array of antitheses,
combining strength with weakness, wisdom with folly, universal parentage
with narrow family limitation, omnipotent control over events with
submission to a superior destiny;-DESTINY, a name by means of which the
theological problem was cast back into the original obscurity out of
which the powers of the human mind have proved themselves as incapable
of rescuing it, as the efforts of a fly caught in a spider's web to do
more than increase its entanglement.

The oldest notion of Deity was rather indefinite than repulsive. The
positive degradation was of later growth. The God of nature reflects the
changeful character of the seasons, varying from dark to bright.
Alternately angry and serene, and lavishing abundance which she again
withdraws, nature seems inexplicably capricious,

<span id="page_690">p. 690</span>

and though capable of responding to the highest requirements of the
moral sentiment through a general comprehension of her mysteries, more
liable by a partial or hasty view to become darkened into a Siva, a
Saturn, or a Mexitli, a patron of fierce orgies or blood-stained altars.
All the older poetical personifications exhibit traces of this
ambiguity. They are neither wholly immoral nor purely beneficent.

No people have ever deliberately made their Deity a malevolent or guilty
Being. The simple piety which ascribed the origin of all things to God,
took all in good part, trusting and hoping all things. The Supreme Ruler
was at first looked up to with unquestioning reverence. No startling
discords or contradictions had yet raised a doubt as to His beneficence,
or made men dissatisfied with His government. Fear might cause anxiety,
but could not banish hope, still less inspire aversion. It was only
later, when abstract notions began to assume the semblance of realities,
and when new or more distinct ideas suggested new words for their
expression, that it became necessary to fix a definite barrier between
Evil and Good.

To account for moral evil, it became necessary to devise some new
expedient suited both to the piety and self-complacency of the inventor,
such as the perversity of woman, or an agent distinct from God, a Typhon
or Ahriman, obtained either by dividing the Gods into two classes, or by
dethroning the Ancient Divinity, and changing him into a Dev or Dæmon.
Through a similar want, the Orientals devised the inherent corruption of
the fleshy and material; the Hebrew transferred to Satan everything
illegal and immoral; and the Greek reflection, occasionally adopting the
older and truer view, retorted upon man the obloquy cast on these
creatures of his imagination, and showed how he has to thank himself
alone for his calamities, while his good things are the voluntary
*gifts*, not the *plunder* of Heaven. Homer had already made Zeus
exclaim, in the Assembly of Olympus, "Grievous it is to hear these
mortals accuse the Gods; they pretend that evils come from us; but they
themselves occasion them gratuitously by their own wanton folly." "It is
the fault of man," said Solon; in reference to the social evils of his
day, "not of God, that destruction comes;" and Euripides, after a formal
discussion of the origin of evil, comes to the conclusion that men act
wrongly, not from want of natural good sense and feeling, but because
knowing

<span id="page_691">p. 691</span>

what is good, they yet for various reasons neglect to practise it.

And at last reaching the highest truth, Pindar, Hesiod, Æschylus, Æsop,
and Horace said, "All virtue is a struggle; life is not a scene of
repose, but of energetic action. Suffering is but another name for the
teaching of experience, appointed by Zeus himself, the giver of all
understanding, to be the parent of instruction, the schoolmaster of
life. He indeed put an end to the golden age; he gave venom to serpents
and predacity to wolves; he shook the honey from the leaf, and stopped
the flow of wine in the rivulets; he concealed the element of fire, and
made the means of life scanty and precarious. But in all this his object
was beneficent; it was not to destroy life, but to improve it. It was a
blessing to man, not a curse, to be sentenced to earn his bread by the
sweat of his brow; for nothing great or excellent is attainable without
exertion; safe and easy virtues are prized neither by gods nor men; and
the parsimoniousness of nature is justified by its powerful effect in
rousing the dormant faculties, and forcing on mankind the invention of
useful arts by means of meditation and thought."

Ancient religious reformers pronounced the worship of "idols" to be the
root of all evil; and there have been many iconoclasts in different ages
of the world. The maxim still holds good; for the worship of idols, that
is, of fanciful conceits, if not the source of *all* evil, is still the
cause of much; and it prevails as extensively now as it ever did. Men
are ever engaged in worshipping the picturesque fancies of their own
imaginations.

Human wisdom must always be limited and incorrect; and even right
opinion is only a something intermediate between ignorance and
knowledge. The normal condition of man is that of progress. Philosophy
is a kind of journey, ever learning, yet never arriving at the ideal
perfection of truth. A Mason should, like the wise Socrates, assume the
modest title of a "lover of wisdom"; for he must ever long after
something more excellent than he possesses, something still beyond his
reach, which he desires to make eternally his own.

Thus the philosophic sentiment came to be associated with the poetical
and the religious, under the comprehensive name of Love. Before the
birth of Philosophy, Love had received but scanty and inadequate homage.
This mightiest and most ancient of gods, coeval with the existence of
religion and of the world, had been

<span id="page_692">p. 692</span>

indeed unconsciously felt, but had neither been worthily honored nor
directly celebrated in hymn or pæn. In the old days of ignorance it
could scarcely have been recognized. In order that it might exercise its
proper influence over religion and philosophy, it was necessary that the
God of Nature should cease to be a God of terrors, a personification of
mere Power or arbitrary Will, a pure and stern Intelligence, an
inflictor of evil, and an unrelenting Judge. The philosophy of Plato, in
which this charge became forever established, was emphatically a
mediation of Love. With him, the inspiration of Love first kindled the
light of arts and imparted them to mankind; and not only the arts of
mere existence, but the heavenly art of wisdom, which supports the
Universe. It inspires high and generous deeds and noble self-devotion.
Without it, neither State nor individual could do anything beautiful or
great. Love is our best pilot, confederate, supporter, and saviour; the
ornament and governor of all things human and divine; and he with divine
harmony forever soothes the minds of men and gods.

Man is capable of a higher Love, which, marrying mind with mind and with
the Universe, brings forth all that is noblest in his faculties, and
lifts him beyond himself. This higher love is neither mortal nor
immortal, but a power intermediate between the human and the Divine,
filling up the mighty interval, and binding the Universe together. He is
chief of those celestial emissaries who carry to the gods the prayers of
men, and bring down to men the gifts of the gods. "He is forever poor,
and far from being beautiful as mankind imagine, for he is squalid and
withered; he flies low along the ground, is homeless and unsandalled;
sleeping without covering before the doors and in the unsheltered
streets, and possessing so far his mother's nature as being ever the
companion of want. Yet, sharing also that of his father, he is forever
scheming to obtain things good and beautiful; he is fearless, vehement,
and strong; always devising some new contrivance; strictly cautious and
full of inventive. resource; a philosopher through his whole existence,
a powerful enchanter, and a subtle sophist."

The ideal consummation of Platonic science is the arrival at the
contemplation of that of which earth exhibits no express image or
adequate similitude, the Supreme Prototype of all beauty, pure and
uncontaminated with human intermixture of flesh or color, the Divine
Original itself. To one so qualified is given the prerogative

<span id="page_693">p. 693</span>

of bringing forth not mere images and shadows of virtue, but virtue
itself, as having been conversant not with shadows, but with the truth;
and having so brought forth and nurtured a progeny of virtue, he becomes
the friend of God, and, so far as such a privilege can belong to any
human being, immortal.

Socrates believed, like Heraclitus, in a Universal Reason pervading all
things and all minds, and consequently revealing itself in ideas. He
therefore sought truth in general opinion, and perceived in the
communication of mind with mind one of the greatest prerogatives of
wisdom and the most powerful means of advancement. He believed true
wisdom to be an attainable idea, and that the moral convictions of the
mind, those eternal instincts of temperance, conscientiousness, and
justice, implanted in it by the gods, could not deceive, if rightly
interpreted.

This metaphysical direction given to philosophy ended in visionary
extravagance. Having assumed truth to be discover-able in thought, it
proceeded to treat thoughts as truths. It thus became an idolatry of
notions, which it considered either as phantoms exhaled from objects, or
as portions of the divine pre-existent thought; thus creating a
mythology of its own, and escaping from one thraldom only to enslave
itself afresh. Theories and notions indiscriminately formed and defended
are the false gods or "idols" of philosophy. For the word *idolon* means
image, and a false *mind*-picture of God is as much an idol as a false
*wooden* image of Him. Fearlessly launching into the problem of
universal being, the first philosophy attempted to supply a compendious
and decisive solution of every doubt. To do this, it was obliged to make
the most sweeping assumptions; and as poetry had already filled the vast
void between the human and the divine, by personifying its Deity as man,
so philosophy bowed down before the supposed reflection of the divine
image in the mind of the inquirer, who, in worshipping his own notions,
had unconsciously deified himself. Nature thus was enslaved to common
notions, and notions very often to words.

By the clashing of incompatible opinions, philosophy was gradually
reduced to the ignominious confession of utter incapacity, and found its
check or intellectual fall in skepticism. Xenophanes and Heraclitus
mournfully acknowledged the unsatisfactory result of all the struggles
of philosophy, in the admission of a universality of doubt; and the
memorable effort of Socrates to rally

<span id="page_694">p. 694</span>

the discomfited champions of truth, ended in a similar confession.

The worship of abstractions continued the error which personified Evil
or deified Fortune; and when mystical philosophy resigned its place to
mystical religion, it changed not its nature, but only its name. The
great task remained unperformed, of reducing the outward world and its
principles to the dominion of the intellect, and of reconciling the
conception of the supreme unalterable power asserted by reason, with the
requisitions of human sympathies.

A general idea of purpose and regularity in nature had been suggested by
common appearances to the earliest reflection. The ancients perceived a
natural order, a divine legislation, from which human institutions were
supposed to be derived, laws emblazoned in Heaven, and thence revealed
to earth. But the divine law was little more than an analogical
inference from human law, taken in the vulgar sense of arbitrary will or
partial covenant. It was surmised rather than discovered, and remained
unmoral because unintelligible. It mattered little, under the
circumstances, whether the Universe were said to be governed by chance
or by reason, since the latter, if misunderstood, was virtually one with
the former. "Better far," said Epicurus, "acquiesce in the fables of
tradition, than acknowledge the oppressive necessity of the physicists";
and Menander speaks of God, Chance, and Intelligence as
undistinguishable. Law unacknowledged goes under the name of *Chance*:
perceived, but not understood, it becomes *Necessity*. The wisdom of the
Stoic was a dogged submission to the arbitrary behests of one; that of
the Epicurean an advantage snatched by more or less dexterous management
from the equal tyranny of the other.

Ignorance sees nothing necessary, and is self abandoned to a power
tyrannical because defined by no rule, and paradoxical because
permitting evil, while itself assumed to be unlimited, all-powerful, and
perfectly good. A little knowledge, presuming the identification of the
Supreme Cause with the inevitable certainty of perfect reason, but
omitting the analysis or interpretation of it, leaves the mind
chain-bound in the ascetic fatalism of the Stoic. Free-will, coupled
with the universal rule of Chance; or Fatalism and Necessity, coupled
with Omniscience and fixed and unalterable Law, these are the
alternatives, between which the human

<span id="page_695">p. 695</span>

mind has eternally vacillated. The Supernaturalists, contemplating a
Being acting through impulse, though with superhuman wisdom, and
considering the best courtier to be the most favored subject, combines
contradictory expedients, inconsistently mixing the assertion of free
action with the enervating service of petition; while he admits, in the
words of a learned archbishop, that "if the production of the things we
ask for depend on antecedent, natural, and necessary causes, our desires
will be answered no less by the omission than the offering of prayers,
which, therefore, are a vain thing."

The last stage is that in which the religion of action is made
legitimate through comprehension of its proper objects and conditions.
Man becomes morally free only when both notions, that of Chance and that
of incomprehensible Necessity, are displaced by that of Law. Law, as
applied to the Universe, means that universal, providential
pre-arrangement, whose conditions can be discerned and discretionally
acted on by human intelligence. The sense of freedom arises when the
individual independence develops itself according to its own laws,
without external collisions or hindrance; that of constraint, where it
is thwarted or confined by other Natures, or where, by combination of
external forces, the individual force is compelled into a new direction.
Moral choice would not exist safely, or even at all, unless it were
bounded by conditions determining its preferences. Duty supposes a rule
both intelligible and certain, since an uncertain rule would be
unintelligible, and if unintelligible, there could be no responsibility.
No law that is unknown can be obligatory; and that Roman Emperor was
justly execrated, who pretended to promulgate his penal laws, by putting
them up at such a height that none could read them.

Man commands results, only by selecting among the contingent the
pre-ordained results most suited to his purposes. In regard to absolute
or divine morality, meaning the final cause or purpose of those
comprehensive laws which often seem harsh to the individual, because
inflexibly just and impartial to the universal, speculation must take
refuge in faith; the immediate and obvious purpose often bearing so
small a proportion to a wider and unknown one, as to be relatively
absorbed or lost. The rain that, unseasonable to me, ruins my hopes of
an abundant crop, does so because it could not otherwise have blessed
and prospered the crops of another kind of a whole neighboring district
of country. The

<span id="page_696">p. 696</span>

obvious purpose of a sudden storm of snow, or an unexpected change of
wind, exposed to which I lose my life, bears small proportion to the
great results which are to flow from that storm or wind over a whole
continent. So always, of the good and ill which at first seemed
irreconcilable and capriciously distributed, the one holds its ground,
the other diminishes by being explained. In a world of a multitude of
individuals, a world of action and exertion, a world affording, by the
conflict of interests and the clashing of passions, any scope for the
exercise of the manly and generous virtues, even Omnipotence cannot make
it, that the comfort and convenience of one man alone shall always be
consulted.

Thus the educated mind soon begins to appreciate the moral superiority
of a system of law over one of capricious interference; and as the
jumble of means and ends is brought into more intelligible perspective,
partial or seeming good is cheerfully resigned for the disinterested and
universal. Self-restraint is found not to imply self-sacrifice. The true
meaning of what appeared to be Necessity is found to be, not arbitrary
Power, but Strength and Force enlisted in the service of Intelligence.
God having made us men, and placed us in a world of change and eternal
renovation, with ample capacity and abundant means for rational
enjoyment, we learn that it is folly to repine because we are not
angels, inhabiting a world in which change and the clashing of interests
and the conflicts of passion are unknown.

The mystery of the world remains, but is sufficiently cleared up to
inspire confidence. We are constrained to admit that if every man would
but do the best in his power to do, and that which he knows he ought to
do, we should need no better world than this. Man, surrounded by
necessity, is free, not in a dogged determination of isolated will,
because, though inevitably complying with nature's laws, he is able,
proportionately to his knowledge, to modify, in regard to himself, the
conditions of their action, and so to preserve an average uniformity
between their forces and his own.

Such are some of the conflicting opinions of antiquity; and we have to
some extent presented to you a picture of the Ancient Thought. Faithful,
as far as it goes, it exhibits to us Man's Intellect ever struggling to
pass beyond the narrow bounds of the circle in which its limited powers
and its short vision confine it; and ever we find it travelling round
the circle, like one lost in a

<span id="page_697">p. 697</span>

wood, to meet the same unavoidable and insoluble difficulties. Science
with her many instruments, Astronomy, particularly, with her telescope,
Physics with the microscope, and Chemistry with its analyses and
combinations, have greatly enlarged our ideas of the Deity, by
discovering to us the vast extent of the Universe in both directions,
its star-systems and its invisible swarms of minutest animal life; by
acquainting us with the new and wonderful Force or Substance we call
Electricity, apparently a link between Matter and Spirit: and still the
Deity only becomes more incomprehensible to us than ever, and we find
that in our speculations we but reproduce over and over again the
Ancient Thought.

Where, then, amid all these conflicting opinions, is the True Word of a
Mason?

My Brother, most of the questions which have thus tortured men's minds,
it is not within the reach and grasp of the Human Intellect to
understand; but without understanding, as we have explained to you
heretofore, we may and must *believe*.

The True Word of a Mason is to be found in the concealed and profound
meaning of the Ineffable Name of Deity, communicated by God to Moses;
and which meaning was long lost by the very precautions taken to conceal
it. The true pronunciation of that name was in truth a secret, in which,
however, was involved the far more profound secret of its meaning. In
that meaning is included all the truth than can be known by us, in
regard to the nature of God.

Long known as AL, AL SCHADAI, ALOHAYIM, and ADONAI; as the Chief or
Commander of the Heavenly Armies; as the aggregate of the Forces
\[ALOHAYIM\] of Nature; as the Mighty, the Victorious, the Rival of Bal
and Osiris; as the Soul of Nature, Nature itself, a God that was but Man
personified, a God with human passions, the God of the Heathen with but
a mere change of name, He assumes, in His communications to Moses, the
name ‏ו ?Y?H?W?H‎ \[IHUH\], and says to Him, ‏ו ?A?H?Y?H ?A?Sה?R
?A?H?Y?H‎ \[AHIH ASHR AHIH\], I AM WHAT I AM. Let us examine the
esoteric or inner meaning of this Ineffable Name.

‏ו ?H?Y?H‎ \[HIH\] is the imperfect tense of the verb To BE, of which ‏ו
?Y?H?Y?H‎ \[IHIH\] is the present; ‏ו ?A?H?Y‎ \[AHI--‏ו ?A‎ being the
personal pronoun "I" affixed\] the first person, by apocope; and, ‏ו
?Y?H?Y‎ \[IHI\] the third. The verb has the following forms: . . .
Preterite, 3d person, masculine singular, ‏ו ?H?Y?H‎ \[HIH\], did exist,
was; 3d person corn.

<span id="page_698">p. 698</span>

plural, ‏ו ?H?Y?W‎ \[HIU\] . . . Present, 3d pers. masc. sing. ‏ו
?Y?H?Y?H‎ \[IHIH\], once ‏ו ?Y?H?W?A‎ \[IHUA\], by apocope, ‏ו ?A?H?Y‎,
‏ו ?Y?H?Y‎ \[AHI, IHI\] . . Infinitive, ‏ו ?H?Y?H‎, ‏ו ?H?Y?W‎ \[HIH,
HIU\] . . . Imperative, 2d pers. masc. sing. ‏ו ?H?Y?H‎ \[HIH\], fem. ‏ו
?H?W?Y‎ \[HUI\] . . . Participle, masc. sing. ‏ו ?H?W?H‎ \[HUH\],
ENS--EXISTING . . EXISTENCE.

The verb is never used, as the mere logical copula or connecting word,
is, was, etc., is used with the Greeks, Latins, and ourselves. It always
implies existence, actuality. The present form also includes the future
sense, . . shall or may be or exist. And ‏ו ?H?W?H‎ and ‏ו ?H?W?A‎ \[HUH
and HUA\] Chaldaic forms of the imperfect tense of the verb, are the
same as the Hebrew ‏ו ?H?W?H‎ and ‏ו ?H?Y?H‎ \[HUH and HIH\], and mean
was, existed, became.

Now ‏ו ?H?W?A‎ and ‏ו ?H?Y?A‎ \[HUA and HIA\] are the Personal Pronoun
\[Masculine and Feminine\], HE, SHE. Thus in Gen. iv. 20 we have the
phrase, ‏ו ?H?W?A ?H?Y?H‎ \[HUA HIH\], HE WAS: and in Lev. xxi. 9, ‏ו
?A?Tה ?A?B?Y?H ?H?Y?A‎ \[ATH ABIH HIA\], HER Father. This feminine
pronoun, however, is often written ‏ו ?H?W?A‎ \[HUA\], and ‏ו ?H?Y?A‎
\[HIA\] occurs only eleven times in the Pentateuch. Sometimes the
feminine form means IT; but *that* pronoun is generally in the masculine
form.

When either, ‏ו ?Y‎, ‏ו ?W‎, ‏ו ?H‎,or ‏ו ?A‎, \[Yo\_d, Vav, He, or
Aleph\] terminates a word, and has no vowel either immediately preceding
or following it, it is often rejected; as in ‏ו ?G?Y‎ \[GI\], for ‏ו
?G?Y?A‎ \[GIA\], a valley,

So ‏ו ?H?W?A-?H?Y?A‎ \[HUA-HIA\], He-She, could properly be written ‏ו
?H?W-?H?Y‎ \[HU-HI\]; or by transposition of the letters, common with
the Talmudists, ‏ו ?Y?H-?W?H‎ \[Iii-UH\], which is the Tetragrammaton or
Ineffable Name.

In Gen. i. 27, it is said, "So the ALHIM created man in His image: *in
the image* of ALHIM created He him: MALE and FE-MALE created He them."

Sometimes the word was thus expressed; triangularly:

<span id="img_69800"></span> ![](img/69800.jpg)

And we learn that this designation of the Ineffable Name was, among the
Hebrews, a symbol of Creation. The mysterious union *of God with His
creatures* was in the letter ‏ו ?H‎, which they considered to be the
Agent of Almighty Power; and to enable the possessor of the Name to work
miracles.

The Personal Pronoun ‏ו ?H?W?A‎ \[HUA\], HE, is often used *by itself*,

<span id="page_699">p. 699</span>

to express the Deity. Lee says that in such cases, IHUH, IH, or ALHIM,
or some other name of God, is *understood*; but there is no necessity
for that. It means in such cases the Male, Generative, or Creative
Principle or Power.

It was a common practice with the Talmudists to conceal secret meanings
and sounds of words by transposing the letters.

The reversal of the letters of words was, indeed, anciently common
everywhere. Thus from *Neitha*, the name of an Egyptian Goddess, the
Greeks, writing backward, formed *Athenè*, the name of Minerva. In
Arabic we have *Nahid*, a name of the planet Venus, which, reversed,
gives *Dihan*, Greek, in Persian, *Nihad*, Nature; which Sir William
Jones writes also *Nahid*. Strabo informs us that the Armenian name of
Venus was *Anaitis*.

*Tien*, Heaven, in Chinese, reversed, is *Neit*, or *Neith*, worshipped
at Sais in Egypt. Reverse *Neitha*, drop the *i*, and add an *e*, and
we, as before said, *Athenè*. *Mitra* was the name of Venus among the
ancient Persians. Herodotus, who tells us this, also informs us that her
name, among the Scythians, was *Artim pasa*. *Artim* is *Mitra*,
reversed. So, by reversing it, the Greeks formed Artemis, Diana.

One of the meanings of *Rama*, in Sanscrit, is *Kama*, the Deity of
*Love*. Reverse this, and we have *Amar*, and by changing *a* into *o*,
*Amor*, the Latin word for *Love*. Probably, as the verb is *Amare*, the
oldest reading was *Amar* and not *Amor*. So *Dipaka*, in Sanscrit, one
of the meanings whereof is *love*, is often written *Dipuc*. Reverse
this, and we have, adding *o*, the Latin word *Cupido*.

In Arabic, the radical letters *rhm*, pronounced *rahm*, signify the
*trunk*, *compassion*, *mercy*; this reversed, we have *mhr*, in Persic,
*love* and the *Sun*. In Hebrew we have *Lab*, the *heart*; and in
Chaldee, *Bal*, the *heart*; the radical letters of both being *b* and
*l*.

The Persic word for *head* is *Sar*. Reversed, this becomes *Ras* in
Arabic and Hebrew, Raish in Chaldee, Rash in Samaritan, and Ryas in
Ethiopic; all meaning *head*, *chief*, etc. In Arabic we have *Kid*, in
the sense of *rule*, regulation, article of agreement, obligation;
which, reversed, becomes, adding *e*, the Greek *dikè* justice. In
Coptic we have *Chlom*, a crown. Reversed, we have in Hebrew, *Moloch*
or *Malec*, a King, or he who wears a crown.

In the Kou-onen, or oldest Chinese writing, by Hieroglyphics, <span

initial letter modified\], was the Sun: in Persic, *Gwar* and in Turkish
*Giun*. *Yue* \[<span id="img_69901"></span> ![](img/69901.jpg)\], was
the Moon;

<span id="page_700">p. 700</span>

in Sanscrit *Uh*, and in Turkish *Ai*. It will be remembered that, in
Egypt and elsewhere, the Sun was originally feminine, and the Moon
masculine. In Egypt, *Ioh* was the moon: and in the feasts of Bacchus
they cried incessantly, *Euoï Sabvi*! *Euoï Bakhè*! *Io Bakhe*! *Io
Bakhe*!

Bunsen gives the following personal pronouns for he and she:

<div align="center">

Thus the Ineffable Name not only embodies the Great Philosophical Idea,
that the Deity is the ENS, the TO ON, the Absolute Existence, that of
which the Essence is To Exist, the only Substance of Spinoza, the BEING,
that never could *not* have existed, as contradistinguished from that
which only *becomes*, not Nature or the Soul of Nature, but that which
created Nature; but also the idea of the Male and Female Principles, in
its highest and most profound sense; to wit, that God originally
comprehended in Himself all that is: that matter was not co-existent
with Him, or independent of Him; that He did not merely fashion and
shape a pre-existing chaos into a Universe; but that His Thought
manifested itself outwardly in that Universe, which so *became*, and
before *was not*, except as comprehended in Him: that the Generative
Power or Spirit, and Productive Matter, ever among the ancients deemed
the Female, originally were in God; and that He Was and Is all that Was,
that Is, and that Shall be: *in* Whom all else lives, moves, and has its
being.

This was the great Mystery of the Ineffable Name; and this true
arrangement of its letters, and of course its true pronunciation and its
meaning, soon became lost to all except the select few to whom it was
confided; it being concealed from the common people, because the Deity
thus metaphysically named was not that personal and capricious, and as
it were tangible God in whom they believed, and who alone was within the
reach of their rude capacities.

Diodorus says that the name given by Moses to God was ΙΑΩ. Theodorus
says that the Samaritans termed God *IABE*, but the Jews ΙΑΩ. Philo
Byblius gives the form ΙΕΥΩ; and Clemens

<span id="page_701">p. 701</span>

of Alexandria ΙΑΟΥ. Macrobius says that it was an admitted axiom among
the Heathen, that the triliteral ΙΑΩ was the sacred name of the Supreme
God. And the Clarian oracle said: "Learn thou that ΙΑΩ is the great God
Supreme, that ruleth over all." The letter Ι signified Unity. Α and Ω
are the first and last letters of the Greek Alphabet.

Hence the frequent expression: "I am the First, and I am the Last; and
besides Me there is no other God. I am Α and Ω, the First and the Last.
I am Α and Ω, the Beginning and the Ending, which Is, and Was, and Is to
come: the Omnipotent." For in this we see shadowed forth the same great
truth; that God is all in all--the Cause and the Effect--the beginning,
or Impulse, or Generative Power: and the Ending, or Result, or that
which is produced: that He is in reality all that is, all that ever was,
and all that ever will be; in this sense, that nothing besides Himself
has existed eternally, and co-eternally with Him, independent of Him,
and self-existent, or self-originated.

And thus the meaning of the expression, ALOHAYIM, a *plural* noun, used,
in the account of the Creation with which Genesis commences, with a
singular verb, and of the name or title IHUH-ALHIM, used for the first
time in the 4th verse of the 2d chapter of the same book, becomes clear.
The ALHIM is the aggregate unity of the manifested Creative Forces or
Powers of Deity, His Emanations; and IHUH-ALHIM is the ABSOLUTE
Existence, or Essence of these Powers and Forces, of which they are
Active Manifestations and Emanations.

This was the profound truth hidden in the ancient allegory and covered
from the general view with a double veil. This was the esoteric meaning
of the generation and production of the Indian, Chaldæan, and Phœnician
[cosmogonies](errata.htm#33.md); and the Active and Passive Powers, of the
Male and Female Principles; of Heaven and its Luminaries generating, and
the Earth producing; all hiding from vulgar view, as above its
comprehension, the doctrine that matter is not eternal, but that God was
the only original Existence, the ABSOLUTE, from Whom everything has
proceeded, and to Whom all returns: and that all moral law springs not
from the relation of things, but from His Wisdom and Essential Justice,
as the Omnipotent Legislator. And this Taut WORD is with entire accuracy
said to have been *lost*; because its *meaning* was lost, even among the
Hebrews, although we still find the name (its real

<span id="page_702">p. 702</span>

meaning unsuspected), in the Hu of the Druids and the *FO*-Hi of the
Chinese.

When we conceive of the Absolute Truth, Beauty, or Good, we cannot stop
short at the abstraction of either. We are forced to refer each to some
living and substantial Being, in which they have their foundations, some
being that is the first and last principle of each.

Moral Truth, like every other universal and necessary truth, cannot
remain a mere abstraction. Abstractions are unrealities. In ourselves,
moral truth is merely conceived of. There must be *somewhere* a Being
that not only *conceives* of, but *constitutes* it. It has this
characteristic; that it is not only, to the eyes of our intelligence, an
universal and necessary truth, but one obligatory on our will. It is A
LAW. *We* do not establish that law *ourselves*. It is imposed on us
*despite* ourselves: its principle must be *without* us. It supposes a
*legislator*. He cannot be the being to whom the law applies; but must
be one that possesses in the highest degree all the characteristics of
moral truth. The moral law, universal and necessary, necessarily has as
its author a necessary being;--composed of justice and charity, its
author most be a being possessing the plenitude of both.

As all *beautiful* and all *true* things refer themselves, *these* to a
Unity which is absolute TRUTH, and those to a Unity which is absolute
BEAUTY, so all the *moral* principles centre in a single principle,
which is THE GOOD. Thus we arrive at the conception of GOOD *in itself*,
the ABSOLUTE Good, superior to all *particular* duties, and determinate
in those duties. This Absolute *Good* must necessarily be an attribute
of the Absolute BEING. There cannot be *several* Absolute Beings; the
one in whom are realized Absolute Truth and Absolute Beauty being
different from the one in whom is realized Absolute Good. The Absolute
necessarily implies absolute Unity. The True, the Beautiful, and the
Good are not three distinct essences: but they are one and the same
essence, considered in its fundamental attributes: the different phases
which, in our eyes, the Absolute and Infinite Perfection assumes.
Manifested in the World of the Finite and Relative, these three
attributes separate from each other, and are distinguished by our minds,
which can comprehend nothing except by division. But in the Being from
Whom they emanate, they are indivisibly united; and this Being, at once
triple and one, Who

<span id="page_703">p. 703</span>

sums up in Himself perfect *Beauty*, perfect *Truth*, and the perfect
Good, is GOD.

God is necessarily the principle of Moral Truth, and of personal
morality. Man is a moral person, that is to say, one endowed with reason
and liberty. He is capable of Virtue: and Virtue has with him two
principal forms, respect for others and love of others, *justice* and
*charity*.

The *creature* can possess no real and essential attribute which the
*Creator* does not possess. The *effect* can draw its reality and
existence only from its *cause*. The *cause* contains in itself, at
least, what is essential in the *effect*. The characteristic of the
effect is inferiority, short-coming, imperfection. Dependent and
derivate, it bears in itself the marks and conditions of dependence; and
its imperfection proves the perfection of the cause; or else there would
be in the effect something immanent, without a cause.

God is not a logical Being, whose Nature may be explained by deduction,
and by means of algebraic equations. When, setting out with a primary
attribute, the attributes of God are deduced one from the other, after
the manner of the Geometricians and Scholastics, we have nothing but
abstractions. We must emerge from this empty [dialectic](errata.htm#34.md),
to arrive at a true and living God. The first notion which we have of
God, that of an *Infinite* Being, is not given us *à priori*,
independently of all experience. It is our consciousness of ourself, as
at once a Being and a limited Being, that immediately raises us to the
conception of a Being, the principle of *our* being, and Himself without
limits. If the existence that we possess forces us to recur to a cause
possessing the same existence in an infinite degree, all the substantial
attributes of existence that we possess equally require each an infinite
cause. God, then, is no longer the Infinite, Abstract, Indeterminate
Being, of which reason and the heart cannot lay hold, but a real Being,
determinate like ourselves, a moral person like ourself; and the study
of our own souls will conduct us, without resort to hypothesis, to a
conception of God, both sublime and having a connection with ourselves.

If man be free, God must be so. It would be strange if, while the
creature has that marvellous power of disposing of himself, of choosing
and willing freely, the Being that has made him should be subject to a
necessary development, the cause of which, though

<span id="page_704">p. 704</span>

in Himself, is a sort of abstract, mechanical, or metaphysical power,
inferior to the personal, voluntary cause which we are, and of which we
have the clearest consciousness. God is free *because* we are: but he is
not free *as* we are. He is at once *everything* that we are, and
*nothing* that we are. He possesses the same attributes as we, but
extended to infinity. He possesses, then, an infinite liberty, united to
an infinite intelligence; and as His intelligence is infallible, exempt
from the uncertainty of deliberation, and perceiving at a glance where
the Good is, so His liberty accomplishes it spontaneously and without
effort.

As we assign to God that liberty which is the basis of our existence, so
also we transfer to His character, from our own, justice and charity. In
man they are virtues: in God, His attributes. What is in us the
laborious conquest of liberty, is in Him His very nature. The idea of
the right, and the respect paid to the right, are signs of the dignity
of our existence. If respect of rights is the very essence of justice,
the Perfect Being must know and respect the rights of the lowest of His
creatures; for He assigned them those rights. In God resides a sovereign
justice, that renders to every one what is due him, not according to
deceitful appearances, but according to the truth of things. And if man,
a limited being, has the power to go out of himself, to forget his own
person, to love another like himself, and devote himself to his
happiness, dignity, and perfection, the Perfect Being must have, in an
infinite degree, that disinterested tenderness, that Charity, the
Supreme Virtue of the human person. There is in God an infinite
tenderness for His creatures, manifested in His giving us existence,
which He might have withheld; and every day it appears in innumerable
marks of His Divine Providence.

Plato well understood that love of God, and expresses it in these great
words: "Let us speak of the cause which led the Supreme Arranger of the
Universe to produce and regulate that Universe. He was good; and he who
is good has no kind of ill-will. Exempt from that, He willed that
created things should be, as far as possible, like Himself." And
Christianity in its turn said, "*God has so loved men that He has given
them His only Son*."

It is not correct to affirm, as is often done, that Christianity has in
some sort *discovered* this noble sentiment. We must not lower human
nature, to raise Christianity. Antiquity knew, described, and practised
charity; the first feature of which, so touching, and

<span id="page_705">p. 705</span>

thank God! so common, is goodness, as its loftiest one is heroism.
Charity is devotion to another; and it is ridiculously senseless to
pretend that there ever was an age of the world, when the human soul was
deprived of that part of its heritage, the power of devotion. But it is
certain that Christianity has diffused and popularized this virtue, and
that, before Christ, these words were never spoken: "LOVE ONE ANOTHER;
FOR THAT IS THE WHOLE LAW." *Charity* presupposes *Justice*. He who
truly loves his brother respects the rights of his brother; but he does
more, he forgets his own. Egoism *sells* or *takes*. Love delights in
*giving*. In God, love is what it is in us; but in an infinite degree.
God is inexhaustible in His charity, as He is inexhaustible in His
essence. That Infinite Omnipotence and Infinite Charity, which, by an
admirable good-will, draws from the bosom of its immense love the favors
which it incessantly bestows on the world and on humanity, teaches us
that the more we give, the more we possess.

God being all just and all good, He can will nothing but what is good
and just. Being Omnipotent, whatever He wills He can do, and
consequently does. The world is the work of God: it is therefore
perfectly made.

Yet there is disorder in the world, that seems to impugn the justice and
goodness of God.

A principle indissolubly connected with the very idea of good, tells us
that every moral agent deserves reward when he does well, and punishment
when he does ill. This principle is universal and necessary. It is
absolute. If it does not apply in this world, it is false, or the world
is badly ordered.

But good actions are not always followed by happiness, nor evil ones by
misery. Though often this fact is more apparent than real; though
virtue, a war against the passions, full of dignity but full of sorrow
and pain, has the latter as its condition, yet the pains that follow
vice are greater; and virtue conduces most to health, strength, and long
life;--though the peaceful conscience that accompanies virtue creates
internal happiness; though public opinion generally decides correctly on
men's characters, and rewards virtue with esteem and consideration, and
vice with con-tempt and infamy; and though, after all, justice reigns in
the world, and the surest road to happiness is still that of virtue, yet
there are exceptions. Virtue is not always rewarded, nor vice punished,
in this life.

<span id="page_706">p. 706</span>

The data of this problem are these: 1st. The principle of merit and
demerit within us is absolute: every good action *ought* to be rewarded,
every bad one punished: 2d. God is just as He is all-powerful: 3d. There
are in this world particular cases, contradicting the necessary and
universal law of merit and demerit. What is the result?

To reject the two principles, that God is just, and the law of merit and
demerit absolute, is to raze to the foundations the whole edifice of
human faith.

To maintain them, is to admit that the present life is to be terminated
or continued elsewhere. The moral person who acts well or ill, and
awaits reward or punishment, is connected with a body, lives with it,
makes use of it, depends upon it in a measure, but is not *it*. The
*body* is composed of parts. It diminishes or increases, it is divisible
even to infinity. But this *something* which has a consciousness of
itself, and says "I, ME"; that feels itself free and responsible, feels
too that it is incapable of division, that it is a being *one* and
*simple*; that the ME cannot be halved, that if a limb is cut off and
thrown away, no part of the ME goes with it: that it remains identical
with itself under the variety of phenomena which successively manifest
it. This identity, indivisibility, and absolute unity of the person, are
its *spirituality*, the very essence of the person. It is not in the
least an hypothesis to affirm that the soul differs essentially from the
body. By the soul we mean *the person*, not separated from the
consciousness of the attributes which constitute it,--*thought* and
*will*. The Existence without consciousness is an abstract being, and
not a person. It is *the person*, that is *identical*, *one*, *simple*.
Its attributes, developing it, do not divide it. Indivisible, it is
indissoluble, and may be immortal. If absolute justice requires this
immortality, it does not require what is impossible. The spirituality of
the soul is the condition and necessary foundation of immortality: the
law of merit and demerit the direct demonstration of it. The first is
the metaphysical, the second the moral proof. Add to these the tendency
of all the powers of the soul toward the Infinite, and the principle of
final causes, and the proof of the immortality of the soul is complete.

God, therefore, in the Masonic creed, is INFINITE TRUTH, INFINITE
BEAUTY, INFINITE GOODNESS. He is the Holy of Holies, as Author of the
Moral Law, as the PRINCIPLE of Liberty, of

<span id="page_707">p. 707</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Justice, and of
Charity, Dispenser of Reward and Punishment. Such a God is not an
abstract God; but an intelligent and free *person*, Who has made us in
His image, from Whom we receive the law that presides over our destiny,
and Whose judgment we await. It is His love that inspires us in *our*
acts of charity: it is His justice that governs *our* justice, and that
of society and the laws. We continually remind ourselves that He is
infinite; because otherwise we should degrade His nature: but He would
be for us as if He were not, if His infinite nature had not forms
inherent in ourselves, the forms of our own reason and soul.

When we love Truth, Justice, and Nobility of Soul, we should know that
it is God we love underneath these special forms, and should unite them
all into one great act of total piety. We should feel that we go in and
out continually in the midst of the vast forces of the Universe, which
are only the Forces of God; that in our studies, when we attain a truth,
we confront the thought of God; when we learn the right, we learn the
will of God laid down as a rule of conduct for the Universe; and when we
feel disinterested love, we should know that we partake the feeling of
the Infinite God. Then, when we reverence the mighty cosmic force, it
will not be a blind Fate in an Atheistic or Pantheistic world, but the
Infinite God, that we shall confront and feel and know. Then we shall be
mindful of the mind of God, conscious of God's conscience, sensible of
His sentiments, and our own existence will be in the infinite being of
God.

The world is a whole, which has its harmony; for a God who is One, could
make none but a complete and harmonious work. The harmony of the
Universe responds to the unity of God, as the indefinite quantity is the
defective sign of the infinitude of God. To say that the Universe is
God, is to admit the world only, and deny God. Give it what name you
please, it is atheism at bottom. On the other hand, to suppose that the
Universe is void of God, and that He is wholly apart from it, is an
insupportable and al-most impossible abstraction. To distinguish is not
to separate. I distinguish, but do not separate myself from my qualities
and effects. So God is not the Universe, although He is everywhere
present in spirit and in truth.

To us, as to Plato, absolute truth is in God. It is God Himself under
one of His phases. In God, as their original, are the immutable
principles of reality and cognizance. In Him things receive

<span id="page_708">p. 708</span>

at once their existence and their intelligibility. It is by
participating in the Divine reason that our own reason possesses
something of the Absolute. Every judgment of reason envelopes a
necessary truth, and every necessary truth supposes the necessary
Existence.

Thus, from every direction,--from metaphysics, æsthetics, and morality
above all, we rise to the same Principle, the common centre, and
ultimate foundation of all truth, all beauty, all good. The True, the
Beautiful, the Good, are but diverse revelations of one and the same
Being. Thus we reach the threshold of religion, and are in communion
with the great philosophies which all proclaim a God; and at the same
time with the religions which cover the earth, and all repose on the
sacred foundation of natural religion; of that religion which reveals to
us the natural light given to all men, without the aid of a particular
revelation. So long as philosophy does not arrive at religion, it is
below all worships, even the most imperfect; for they at least give man
a Father, a Witness, a Consoler, a Judge. By religion, philosophy
connects itself with humanity, which, from one end of the world to the
other, aspires to God, believes in God, hopes in God. Philosophy
contains in itself the common basis of all religious beliefs; it, as it
were, borrows from them their principle, and returns it to them
surrounded with light, elevated above uncertainty, secure against all
attack.

From the necessity of His Nature, the Infinite Being must create and
preserve the Finite, and to the Finite must, in its forms, give and
communicate of His own kind. We cannot conceive of any finite thing
existing without God, the Infinite basis and ground thereof; nor of God
existing without something. God is the necessary logical condition of a
world, its necessitating cause; a world, the necessary logical condition
of God, His necessitated consequence. It is according to His Infinite
Perfection to create, and then to preserve and bless whatever He
creates. That is the conclusion of modern metaphysical science. The
stream of philosophy runs down from Aristotle to Hegel, and breaks off
with this conclusion: and then again recurs the ancient difficulty. If
it be of His nature to create,--if we cannot conceive of His existing
*alone*, without creating, without *having* created, then what He
created was co-existent with Himself. If He could exist an instant
without creating, He could as well do so for a

<span id="page_709">p. 709</span>

myriad of eternities. And so again comes round to us the old doctrine of
a God, the Soul of the Universe, and co-existent with it. For what He
created had a *beginning*; and however long since that creation
occurred, an eternity had before elapsed. The difference between *a*
beginning and *no* beginning is infinite.

But of some things we can be certain. We are conscious of ourselves--of
ourselves if not as substances, at least as Powers to be, to do, to
suffer. We are conscious of ourselves not as self-originated at all or
as self-sustained alone; but only as dependent, first for existence,
ever since for support.

Among the primary ideas of consciousness, that are inseparable from it,
the atoms of self-consciousness, we find the idea of God. Carefully
examined by the [scrutinizing](errata.htm#35.md) intellect, it is the idea
of God as infinite, perfectly powerful, wise, just, loving, holy;
absolute being with no limitation. This made us, made all, sustains us,
sustains all; made our body, not by a single act, but by a series of
acts extending over a vast succession of years,--for man's body is the
resultant of all created things,--made our spirit, our mind, conscience,
affections, soul, will, appointed for each its natural mode of action,
set each at its several aim. Thus self-consciousness leads us to
consciousness of God, and at last to consciousness of an infinite God.
That is the highest evidence of our own existence, and it is the highest
evidence of His.

If there is a God at all, He must be omnipresent in space. Beyond the
last Stars He must be, as He is here. There can be no mote that peoples
the sunbeams, no little cell of life that the microscope discovers in
the seed-sporule of a moss, but He is there.

He must also be omnipresent in time. There was no second of time before
the Stars began to burn, but God was in that second. In the most distant
nebulous spot in Orion's belt, and in every one of the millions that
people a square inch of limestone, God is alike present. He is in the
smallest imaginable or even unimaginable portion of time, and in every
second of its most vast and unimaginable volume; His Here conterminous
with the All of Space, His Now coeval with the All of Time.

Through all this Space, in all this Time, His Being extends, spreads
undivided, operates unspent; God in all His infinity, perfectly
powerful, wise, just, loving, and holy. His being is an infinite
activity, a creating, and so a giving of Himself to the

<span id="page_710">p. 710</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> World. The World's
being is a *becoming*, a being created and continued. It is so now, and
was so, incalculable and unimaginable millions of ages ago.

All this is philosophy, the unavoidable conclusion of the human mind. It
is not the *opinion* of Coleridge and Kant, but their *science*; not
what they *guess*, but what they *know*.

In virtue of this in-dwelling of God in matter, we say that the world is
a revelation of Him, its existence a show of His. He is in His work. The
manifold action of the Universe is only His mode of operation, and all
material things are in communion with Him. All grow and move and live in
Him, and by means of Him, and only so. Let Him withdraw from the space
occupied by anything, and it ceases to be. Let Him withdraw any quality
of His nature from anything, and it ceases to be. All must partake of
Him, He dwelling in each, and yet transcending all.

The failure of fanciful religion to become philosophy, does not preclude
philosophy from coinciding with true religion. Philosophy, or rather its
object, the divine order of the Universe, is the intellectual guide
which the religious sentiment needs; while exploring the real relations
of the finite, it obtains a constantly improving and self-correcting
measure of the perfect law of the Gospel of Love and Liberty, and a
means of carrying into effect the spiritualism of revealed religion. It
establishes law, by ascertaining its terms; it guides the spirit to see
its way to the amelioration of life and the increase of happiness. While
religion was stationary, science could not walk alone; when both are
admitted to be progressive, their interests and aims become identified.
Aristotle began to show how religion may be founded on an intellectual
basis; but the basis he laid was too narrow. Bacon, by giving to
philosophy a definite aim and method, gave it at the same time a safer
and self-enlarging basis. Our position is that of intellectual beings
surrounded by limitations; and the latter being constant, have to
intelligence the practical value of laws, in whose investigation and
application consists that seemingly endless career of intellectual and
moral progress which the sentiment of religion inspires and ennobles.
The title of Saint has commonly been claimed for those whose boast it
has been to despise philosophy; yet faith will stumble and sentiment
mislead, unless knowledge be present, in amount and quality sufficient
to purify the one and to give beneficial direction to the other.

<span id="page_711">p. 711</span>

Science consists of those matured inferences from experience which all
other experience confirms. It is no fixed system superior to revision,
but that progressive mediation between ignorance and wisdom in part
conceived by Plato, whose immediate object is happiness, and its impulse
the highest kind of love. Science realizes and unites all that was truly
valuable in both the old schemes of mediation; the heroic, or system of
action and effort; and the mystical theory of spiritual, contemplative
communion. "Listen to me," says Galen, "as to the voice of the
Eleusinian Hierophant, and believe that the study of nature is a mystery
no less important than theirs, nor less adapted to display the wisdom
and power of the Great Creator. Their lessons and demonstrations were
obscure, but ours are clear and unmistakable."

To science we owe it that no man is any longer entitled to consider
himself the central point around which the whole Universe of life and
motion revolves--the immensely important individual for whose
convenience and even luxurious ease and indulgence the whole Universe
was made. On one side it has shown us an infinite Universe of stars and
suns and worlds at incalculable distances from each other, in whose
majestic and awful presence we sink and even our world sinks into
insignificance; while, on the other side, the microscope has placed us
in communication with new worlds of organized livings beings, gifted
with senses, nerves, appetites, and instincts, in every tear and in
every drop of putrid water.

Thus science teaches us that we are but an infinitesimal portion of a
great whole, that stretches out on every side of us, and above and below
us, infinite in its complications, and which infinite wisdom alone .can
comprehend. Infinite wisdom has arranged the infinite succession of
beings, involving the necessity of birth, decay, and death, and made the
loftiest virtues possible by providing those conflicts, reverses,
trials, and hardships, without which even their names could never have
been invented.

Knowledge is convertible into power, and axioms into rules of utility
and duty. Modern science is social and communicative. It is moral as
well as intellectual; powerful, yet pacific and disinterested; binding
man to man as well as to the Universe; filling up the details of
obligation, and cherishing impulses of virtue, and, by affording clear
proof of the consistency and identity of all

<span id="page_712">p. 712</span>

interests, substituting co-operation for rivalry, liberality for
jealousy, and tending far more powerfully than any other means to
realize the spirit of religion, by healing those inveterate disorders
which, traced to their real origin, will be found rooted in an ignorant
assumption as to the penurious severity of Providence, and the
consequent greed of selfish men to confine what seemed as if extorted
from it to themselves, or to steal from each other rather than quietly
to enjoy their own.

We shall probably never reach those higher forms containing the true
differences of things, involving the full discovery and correct
expression of their very self or essence. We shall ever fall short of
the most general and most simple nature, the ultimate or most
comprehensive law. Our widest axioms explain many phenomena, but so too
in a degree did the principles or elements of the old philosophers, and
the cycles and epicycles of ancient astronomy. We cannot in any case of
causation assign the whole of the conditions, nor though we may
reproduce them in practice, can we mentally distinguish them all,
without knowing the essences of the things including them; and we
therefore must not unconsciously ascribe that absolute certainty to
axioms, which the ancient religionists did to creeds, nor allow the
mind, which ever strives to insulate itself and its acquisitions, to
forget the nature of the process by which it substituted scientific for
common notions, and so with one as with the other lay the basis of
self-deception by a pedantic and superstitious employment of them.

Doubt, the essential preliminary of all improvement and discovery, must
accompany all the stages of man's onward progress. His intellectual life
is a perpetual beginning, a preparation for a birth. The faculty of
doubting and questioning, without which those of comparison and judgment
would be useless, is itself a divine prerogative of the reason.
Knowledge is always imperfect, or complete only in a prospectively
boundless career, in which discovery multiplies doubt, and doubt leads
on to new discovery. The boast of science is not so much its manifested
results, as its admitted imperfection and capacity of unlimited
progress. The true religious philosophy of an imperfect being is not a
system of creed, but, as Socrates thought, an infinite search or
approximation. Finality is but another name for bewilderment or defeat.
Science gratifies the religious feeling without arresting it, and

<span id="page_713">p. 713</span>

opens out the unfathomable mystery of the One Supreme into more explicit
and manageable Forms, which express not indeed His Essence, which is
wholly beyond our reach and higher than our faculties can climb, but His
Will, and so feeds an endless enthusiasm by accumulating forever new
objects of pursuit. We have long experienced that knowledge is
profitable, we are beginning to find out that it is moral, and we shall
at last discover it to be religious.

God and truth are inseparable; a knowledge of God is possession of the
saving oracles of truth. In proportion as the thought and purpose of the
individual are trained to conformity with the rule of right prescribed
by Supreme Intelligence, so far is his happiness promoted, and the
purpose of his existence fulfilled. In this way a new life arises in
him; he is no longer isolated, but is a part of the eternal harmonies
around him. His erring will is directed by the influence of a higher
will, informing and moulding it in the path of his true happiness.

Man's power of apprehending outward truth is a qualified privilege; the
mental like the physical inspiration passing through a diluted medium;
and yet, even when truth, imparted, as it were, by intuition, has been
specious, or at least imperfect, the intoxication of sudden discovery
has ever claimed it as full, infallible, and divine. And while human
weakness needed ever to recur to the pure and perfect source, the
revelations once popularly accepted and valued assumed an independent
substantiality, perpetuating not themselves only, but the whole mass of
[derivative](errata.htm#36.md) forms accidentally connected with them, and
legalized in their names. The mists of error thickened under the shadows
of prescription, until the free light again broke in upon the night of
ages, redeeming the genuine treasure from the superstition which
obstinately doted on its accessories.

Even to the Barbarian, Nature reveals a mighty power and a wondrous
wisdom, and continually points to God. It is no wonder that men
worshipped the several things of the world. The world of matter is a
revelation of fear to the savage in Northern climes; he trembles at his
deity throned in ice and snow. The lightning, the storm, the earthquake
startle the rude man, and he sees the divine in the extraordinary.

The grand objects of Nature perpetually constrain men to think of their
Author. The Alps are the great altar of Europe; the nocturnal

<span id="page_714">p. 714</span>

sky has been to mankind the dome of a temple, starred all over with
admonitions to reverence, trust, and love. The Scriptures for the human
race are writ in earth and Heaven. No organ or miserere touches the
heart like the sonorous swell of the sea or the ocean-wave's
immeasurable laugh. Every year the old world puts on new bridal beauty,
and celebrates its Whit-Sunday, when in the sweet Spring each bush and
tree dons reverently its new glories. Autumn is a long All-Saints' day;
and the harvest is Hallowmass to Mankind. Before the human race marched
down from the slopes of the Himalayas to take possession of Asia,
Chaldea, and Egypt, men marked each annual crisis, the solstices and the
equinoxes, and celebrated religious festivals therein; and even then,
and ever since, the material was and has been the element of communion
between man and God.

Nature is full of religious lessons to a thoughtful man. He dissolves
the matter of the Universe, leaving only its forces; he dissolves away
the phenomena of human history, leaving only immortal spirit; he studies
the law, the mode of action of these forces and this spirit, which make
up the material and the human world, and cannot fail to be filled with
reverence, with trust, with boundless love of the Infinite God, who
devised these laws of matter and of mind, and thereby bears up this
marvellous Universe of things and men. Science has its New Testament;
and the beatitudes of Philosophy are profoundly touching. An undevout
astronomer is mad. Familiarity with the grass and the trees teaches us
deeper lessons of love and trust than we can glean from the writings of
Fénélon and Augustine. The great Bible of God is ever open before
mankind. The eternal flowers of Heaven seem to shed sweet influence on
the perishable blossoms of the earth. The great sermon of Jesus was
preached on a mountain, which preached to Him as He did to the people,
and His figures of speech were first natural figures of fact.

If to-morrow I am to perish utterly, then I shall only take counsel for
to-day, and ask for qualities which last no longer. My fathers will be
to me only as the ground out of which my bread-corn is grown; dead, they
are but the rotten mould of earth, their memory of small concern to me.
Posterity!--I shall care nothing for the future generations of mankind!
I am one atom in the trunk of a tree, and care nothing for the roots
below, or the branch above. I shall sow such seed only as will bear
harvest

<span id="page_715">p. 715</span>

to-day. Passion may enact my statutes to-day, and ambition repeal them
to-morrow. I will know no other legislators. Morality will vanish, and
expediency take its place. Heroism will be gone; and instead of it there
will be the savage ferocity of the he-wolf, the brute cunning of the
she-fox, the rapacity of the vulture, and the headlong daring of the
wild bull; but no longer the cool, calm courage that, for truth's sake,
and for love's sake, looks death firmly in the face, and then wheels
into line ready to be slain. Affection, friendship, philanthropy, will
be but the wild fancies of the monomaniac, fit subjects for smiles or
laughter or for pity.

But knowing that we shall live forever, and that the Infinite God loves
all of us, we can look on all the evils of the world, and see that it is
only the hour before sunrise, and that the light is coming; and so we
also, even we, may light a little taper, to illuminate the darkness
while it lasts, and help until the day-spring come. Eternal morning
follows the night: a rainbow scarfs the shoulders of every cloud that
weeps its rain away to be flowers on land and pearls at sea: Life rises
out of the grave, the soul cannot be held by fettering flesh. No dawn is
hopeless; and disaster is only the threshold of delight.

Beautifully, above the great wide chaos of human errors, shines the
calm, clear light of natural human religion, revealing to us God as the
Infinite Parent of all, perfectly powerful, wise, just, loving, and
perfectly holy too. Beautiful around stretches off every way the
Universe, the Great Bible of God. Material nature is its Old Testament,
millions of years old, thick with eternal truths under our feet,
glittering with everlasting glories over our heads; and Human Nature is
the New Testament from the Infinite God, every day revealing a new page
as Time turns over the leaves. Immortality stands waiting to give a
recompense for every virtue not rewarded, for every tear not wiped away,
for every sorrow undeserved, for every prayer, for every pure intention
and emotion of the heart. And over the whole, over Nature, Material and
Human, over this Mortal Life and over the eternal Past and Future, the
infinite Loving-kindness of God the Father comes enfolding all and
blessing everything that ever was, that is, that ever shall be.

Everything is a thought of the Infinite God. Nature is His prose, and
man His Poetry. There is no Chance, no Fate; but God's Great Providence,
enfolding the whole Universe in its

<span id="page_716">p. 716</span>

bosom, and feeding it with everlasting life. In times past there has
been evil which we cannot understand; now there are evils which we
cannot solve, nor make square with God's perfect goodness by any theory
our feeble intellect enables us to frame. There are sufferings, follies,
and sins for all mankind, for every nation, for every man and every
woman. They were all foreseen by the infinite wisdom of God, all
provided for by His infinite power and justice, and all are consistent
with His infinite love. To believe otherwise would be to believe that He
made the world, to amuse His idle hours with the follies and agonies of
mankind, as Domitian was wont to do with the wrigglings and contortions
of insect agonies. Then indeed we might despairingly unite in that
horrible utterance of Heine: "Alas, God's Satire weighs heavily on me!
The Great Author of the Universe, the Aristophanes of Heaven, is bent on
demonstrating, with crushing force, to me, the little, earthly, German
Aristophanes, how my wittiest sarcasms are only pitiful attempts at
jesting, in comparison with His, and how miserably I am beneath Him, in
humor, in colossal mockery."

No, no! God is not thus amused with and prodigal of human suffering. The
world is neither a Here without a Hereafter, a body without a soul, a
chaos with no God; nor a body blasted by a soul, a Here with a worse
Hereafter, a world with a God that hates more than half the creatures He
has made. There is no Savage, Revengeful, and Evil God: but there is an
Infinite God, seen everywhere as Perfect Cause, everywhere as Perfect
Providence, transcending all, yet in-dwelling everywhere, with perfect
power, wisdom, justice, holiness, and love, providing for the future
welfare of each and all, foreseeing and forecaring for every bubble that
breaks on the great stream of human life and human history.

The end of man and the object of existence in this world, being not only
happiness, but happiness in virtue and through virtue, virtue in this
world is the condition of happiness in another life, and the condition
of virtue in this world is suffering, more or less frequent, briefer or
longer continued, more or less intense. Take away suffering, and there
is no longer any resignation or humanity, no more self-sacrifice, no
more devotedness, no more heroic virtues, no more sublime morality. We
are subjected to suffering, both because we are sensible, and because we
ought to be virtuous. If there were no physical evil, there would be no
possible virtue, and the world would be badly adapted to the destiny of
man.

<span id="page_717">p. 717</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> The apparent
disorders of the physical world, and the evils that result from them,
are not disorders and evils that occur despite the power and goodness of
God. God not only allows, but wills them. It is His will that there
shall be in the physical world causes enough of pain for man, to afford
him occasions for resignation and courage.

Whatever is favorable to virtue, whatever gives the moral liberty more
energy, whatever can serve the greater moral development of the human
race, is good. Suffering is not the worst condition of man on earth. The
worst condition is the moral brutalization which the absence of physical
evil would engender.

External or internal physical evil connects itself with the object of
existence, which is to accomplish the moral law here below, whatever the
consequences, with the firm hope that virtue unfortunate will not fail
to be rewarded in another life. The moral law has its sanction and its
reason in itself. It owes nothing to that law of merit and demerit that
accompanies it, but is not its basis. But, though the principle of merit
and demerit ought not to be the determining principle of virtuous
action, it powerfully concurs with the moral law, because it offers
virtue a legitimate ground of consolation and hope.

Morality is the recognition of duty, as duty, and its accomplishment,
whatever the consequences.

Religion is the recognition of duty in its necessary harmony with
goodness; a harmony that must have its realization in another life,
through the justice and omnipotence of God.

Religion is as true as morality; for once morality is admitted, its
consequences must be admitted.

The whole moral existence is included in these two words, harmonious
with each other: DUTY and HOPE.

Masonry teaches that God is infinitely good. What motive, what reason,
and, morally speaking, what possibility can there be to Infinite Power
and Infinite Wisdom, to be anything but good? Our very sorrows,
proclaiming the loss of objects inexpressibly dear to us, demonstrate
His Goodness. The Being that made us intelligent cannot Himself be
without intelligence; and He Who has made us so to love and to sorrow
for what we love, must number love for the creatures He has made, among
His infinite attributes. Amid all our sorrows, we take refuge in the
assurance that He loves us; that He does not capriciously, or through
indifference,

<span id="page_718">p. 718</span>

and still less in mere anger, grieve and afflict us; that He chastens
us, in order that by His chastisements, which are by His universal law
only the consequences of our acts, we may be profited; and that He could
not show so much love for His creatures, by leaving them unchastened,
untried, undisciplined. We have faith in the Infinite; faith in God's
Infinite Love; and it is that faith that must save us.

No dispensations of God's Providence, no suffering or bereavement is a
messenger of wrath: none of its circumstances are indications of God's
Anger. He is incapable of Anger; higher above any such feelings than the
distant stars are above the earth. Bad men do not die because God hates
them. They die because it is best for them that they should do so; and,
bad as they are, it is better for them to be in the hands of the
infinitely good God, than anywhere else.

Darkness and gloom lie upon the paths of men. They stumble at
difficulties, are ensnared by temptations, and perplexed by trouble.
They are anxious, and troubled, and fearful. Pain and affliction and
sorrow often gather around the steps of their earthly pilgrimage. All
this is written indelibly upon the tablets of the human heart. It is not
to be erased; but Masonry sees and reads it in a new light. It does not
expect these ills and trials and sufferings to be removed from life; but
that the great truth will at some time be believed by all men, that they
are the means, selected by infinite wisdom, to purify the heart, and to
invigorate the soul whose inheritance is immortality, and the world its
school.

Masonry propagates no creed except its own most simple and Sublime One;
that universal religion, taught by Nature and by Reason. Its Lodges are
neither Jewish, Moslem, nor Christian Temples. It reiterates the
precepts of morality of all religions. It venerates the character and
commends the teachings of the great and good of all ages and of all
countries. It extracts the good and not the evil, the truth, and not the
error, from all creeds; and acknowledges that there is much which is
good and true in all.

Above all the other great teachers of morality and virtue, it reveres
the character of the Great Master Who, submissive to the will of His and
our Father, died upon the Cross. All must admit, that if the world were
filled with beings like Him, the great ills of society would be at once
relieved. For all coercion, injury, selfishness, and revenge, and all
the wrongs and the greatest sufferings

<span id="page_719">p. 719</span>

of life, would disappear at once. These human years would be happy; and
the eternal ages would roll on in brightness and beauty; and the still,
sad music of Humanity, that sounds through the world, now in the accents
of grief, and now in pensive melancholy, would change to anthems,
sounding to the March of Time, and bursting out from the heart of the
world.

If every man were a perfect imitator of that Great, Wise, Good Teacher,
clothed with all His faith and all His virtues, how the circle of Life's
ills and trials would be narrowed! The sensual passions would assail the
heart in vain. Want would no longer successfully tempt men to act
wrongly, nor curiosity to do rashly. Ambition, spreading before men its
Kingdoms and its Thrones, and offices and honors, would cause none to
swerve from their great allegiance. Injury and insult would be shamed by
forgiveness. "Father," men would say, "forgive them; for they know not
what they do." None would seek to be enriched at another's loss or
expense. Every man would feel that the whole human race were his
brothers. All sorrow and pain and anguish would be soothed by a perfect
faith and an entire trust in the Infinite Goodness of God. The world
around us would be new, and the Heavens above us; for here, and there,
and everywhere, through all the ample glories and splendors of the
Universe, all men would recognize and feel the presence and the
beneficent care of a loving Father.

However the Mason may believe as to creeds, and churches, and miracles,
and missions from Heaven, he must admit that the Life and character of
Him who taught in Galilee, and fragments of Whose teachings have come
down to us, are worthy of all imitation. That Life is an undenied and
undeniable Gospel. Its teachings cannot be passed by and discarded. All
must admit that it would be happiness to follow and perfection to
imitate Him. None ever felt for Him a sincere emotion of contempt, nor
in anger accused Him of sophistry, nor saw immorality lurking in His
doctrines; however they may judge of those who succeeded Him, and
claimed to be His apostles. Divine or human, inspired or only a
reforming Essene, it must be agreed that His teachings are far nobler,
far purer, far less alloyed with error and imperfection, far less of the
earth earthly, than those of Socrates, Plato, Seneca, or Mahomet, or any
other of the great moralists and Reformers of the world.

<span id="page_720">p. 720</span>

If our aims went as completely as His beyond personal care and selfish
gratification; if our thoughts and words and actions were as entirely
employed upon the great work of benefiting our kind--the true work which
we have been placed here to do--as His were; if our nature were as
gentle and as tender as His; and if society, country, kindred,
friendship, and home were as dear to us as they were to Him, we should
be at once relieved of more than half the difficulties and the diseased
and painful affections of our lives. Simple obedience to rectitude,
instead of self-interest; simple self-culture and self-improvement,
instead of constant cultivation of the good opinion of others;
single-hearted aims and purposes, instead of improper objects, sought
and approached by devious and crooked ways, would free our meditations
of many disturbing and irritating questions.

Not to renounce the nobler and better affections of our natures, nor
happiness, nor our just dues of love and honor from men; not to vilify
ourselves, nor to renounce our self-respect, nor a just and reasonable
sense of our merits and deserts, nor our own righteousness of virtue,
does Masonry require, nor would our imitation of Him require; but to
renounce our vices, our faults, our passions, our self-flattering
delusions; to forego all outward advantages, which are to be gained only
through a sacrifice of our inward integrity, or by anxious and petty
contrivances and appliances; to choose and keep the better part; to
secure that, and let the worst take care of itself; to keep a good
conscience, and let opinion come and go as it will; to retain a lofty
self-respect, and let low self-indulgence go; to keep inward happiness,
and let outward advantages hold a subordinate place; to renounce our
selfishness, and that eternal anxiety as to what we are to have, and
what men think of us; and be content with the plenitude of God's great
mercies, and so to be happy. For it is the inordinate devotion to self,
and consideration of self, that is ever a stumbling-block in the way;
that spreads questions, snares, and difficulties around us, darkens the
way of Providence, and makes the world a far less happy one to us than
it might be.

As He taught, so Masonry teaches, affection to our kindred, tenderness
to our friends, gentleness and forbearance toward our inferiors, pity
for the suffering, forgiveness of our enemies; and to wear an
affectionate nature and gentle disposition as the garment of our life,
investing pain, and toil, and agony, and even death,

<span id="page_721">p. 721</span>

with a serene and holy beauty. It does not teach us to wrap ourselves in
the garments of reserve and pride, to care nothing for the world because
it cares nothing for us, to withdraw our thoughts from society because
it does us not justice, and see how patiently we can live within the
confines of our own bosoms, or in quiet communion, through books, with
the mighty dead. No man ever found peace or light in that way. Every
relation, of hate, scorn, or neglect, to mankind, is full of vexation
and torment. There is nothing to do with men but to love them, to admire
their virtues, pity and bear with their faults, and forgive their
injuries. To hate your adversary will not help you; to kill him will
help you still less: nothing within the compass of the Universe will
help you, but to pity, forgive, and love him.

If we possessed His gentle and affectionate disposition, His love and
compassion for all that err and all that offend, how many difficulties,
both within and without us, would they relieve! How many depressed minds
should we console! How many troubles in society should we compose! How
many enmities soften! How many a knot of mystery and misunderstanding
would be untied by a single word, spoken in simple and confiding truth!
How many a rough path would be made smooth, and how many a crooked path
be made straight! Very many places, now solitary, would be made glad;
very many dark places be filled with light.

Morality has its axioms, like the other sciences; and these axioms are,
in all languages, justly termed moral truths. Moral truths, considered
in themselves, are equally as certain as mathematical truths. Given the
idea of a deposit, the idea of keeping it faithfully is attached to it
as necessarily, as to the idea of q, triangle is attached the idea that
its three angles are equal to two right angles. You may violate a
deposit; but in doing so, do not imagine that you change the nature of
things, or make what is in itself a deposit become your own property.
The two ideas exclude each other. You have but a false semblance of
property: and all the efforts of the passions, all the sophisms of
interest, will not overturn essential differences. Therefore it is that
a moral truth is so imperious; because, like all truth, it is what it
is, and shapes itself to please no caprice. Always the same, and always
present, little as we may like it, it inexorably condemns, with a voice
always heard, but not always regarded, the insensate and guilty

<span id="page_722">p. 722</span>

will which thinks to prevent its existing, by denying, or rather by
pretending to deny, its existence.

The moral truths are distinguished from other truths by this singular
characteristic: so soon as we perceive them, they appear to us as the
rule of our conduct. If it is true that a deposit is made in order to be
returned to its legitimate possessor, it *must* be returned. To the
necessity of *believing* the truth, the necessity of *practising* it is
added.

The necessity of practising the moral truths is obligation. The moral
truths, necessary to the eye of reason, are obligatory on the will. The
moral obligation, like the moral truth which is its basis, is absolute.
As necessary truths are not *more* or *less* necessary, so obligation is
not more or less *obligatory*. There are degrees of importance among
different obligations; but there are no degrees in *the obligation
itself*. One is not *nearly* obliged, *almost* obliged; but *wholly* so,
or *not at all*. If there be any place of refuge against the obligation,
it ceases to exist.

If the obligation is *absolute*, it is *immutable* and *universal*. For
if what is obligation *to-day* may not be so *to-morrow*, if what is
obligatory for *me* may not be so for *you*, the obligation differing
from itself, it would be relative and contingent. This fact of absolute,
immutable, universal obligation is certain and manifest. *The good* is
the foundation of obligation. If it be not, obligation has *no*
foundation; and that is impossible. If one act ought to be done, and
another ought not, it must be because evidently there is an essential
difference between the two acts. If one be not good and the other bad,
the obligation imposed on us is arbitrary.

To make the Good a *consequence*, of anything whatever, is to annihilate
it. It is the first, or it is nothing. When we ask an honest man why,
despite his urgent necessities, he has respected the sanctity of a
deposit, he answers, because it was *his duty*. Asked why it was his
duty, he answers, because it was *right*, was *just*, was *good*. Beyond
that there is no answer to be made, but there is also no question to be
asked. No one permits a duty to be imposed on him without giving himself
a reason for it: but when it is admitted that the duty is commanded by
justice, the mind is satisfied; for it has arrived at a principle beyond
which there is nothing to seek, justice being its own principle. The
primary truths include their own reason: and justice, the essential
distinction between good and evil, is the first truth of morality.

<span id="page_723">p. 723</span>

Justice is not a *consequence*; because we cannot ascend to any
principle above it. Moral truth *forces itself* on man, and does not
*emanate from him*. It no more becomes subjective, by appearing to us
obligatory, than truth does by appearing to us necessary. It is in the
very nature of the true and the good that we must seek for the reason of
necessity and obligation. Obligation is founded on the necessary
distinction between the good and the evil; and it is itself the
foundation of liberty. If man has his duties to perform, he must have
the faculty of accomplishing them, of resisting desire, passion, and
interest, in order to obey the law. He must be free; therefore he is so,
or human nature is in contradiction with itself. The certainty of the
*obligation* involves the corresponding certainty of *free will*.

It is the *will* that is free: though sometimes that will may be
ineffectual. The power *to do* must not be confounded with the power *to
will*. The former may be *limited*: the latter is *sovereign*. The
*external effects* may be prevented: *the resolution* itself cannot. Of
this sovereign power of the will we are conscious. We feel in ourselves,
before it becomes determinate, the force which can determine itself in
one way or another. At the same time when I will this or that, I am
equally conscious that I *can* will the contrary. I am conscious that I
am the master of my resolution: that I may check it, continue it, retake
it. When *the act* has ceased, the consciousness of *the power* which
produced if has *not*. That consciousness and the power remain, superior
to all the manifestations of the power. Wherefore free-will is the
essential and ever-subsisting attribute of the will itself.

At the same time that we judge that a free agent has done a good or a
bad act, we form another judgment, as necessary as the first; that if he
has done well, he deserves compensation; if ill, punishment. That
judgment may be expressed in a manner more or less vivid, according as
it is mingled with sentiments more or less ardent. Sometimes it will be
a merely kind feeling toward a virtuous agent, and moderately hostile to
a guilty one; sometimes enthusiasm or indignation. The judgment of merit
and demerit is intimately connected with the judgment of good and evil.
Merit is the natural right which we have to be rewarded; demerit the
natural right which others have to punish us. But whether the reward is
received, or the punishment undergone, or not, the merit or demerit
equally subsists. Punishment and reward are

<span id="page_724">p. 724</span>

the satisfaction of merit and demerit, but do not constitute them. Take
away the former, and the latter continue. Take away the latter, and
there are no longer real rewards or punishments. When a base man
encompasses our merited honors, he has obtained but the mere appearance
of a reward; a mere material advantage. The reward is essentially moral;
and its value is independent of its form. One of those simple crowns of
oak with which the early Romans rewarded heroism, was of more real value
than all the wealth of the world, when it was the sign of the gratitude
and admiration of a people. Reward accorded to merit is a debt; without
merit it is an alms or a theft.

The Good is good in itself, and to be accomplished, whatever the
consequences. The results of the Good cannot but be fortunate.
Happiness, separated from the Good, is but a fact to which no moral idea
is attached. As an effect of the Good, it enters into the moral order,
completes and crowns it.

Virtue without happiness, and crime without misery, is a contradiction
and disorder. If virtue suppose sacrifice (that is, suffering), eternal
justice requires that sacrifice generously accepted and courageously
borne, shall have for its reward the same happiness that was sacrificed:
and it also requires that crime shall be punished with unhappiness, for
the guilty happiness which it attempted to procure.

This law that attaches pleasure and sorrow to the good and the evil, is,
in general, accomplished even here below. For order rules in the world;
because the world lasts. Is that order sometimes disturbed? Are
happiness and sorrow not always distributed in legitimate proportion to
crime and virtue? The absolute judgment of the Good, the absolute
judgment of obligation, the absolute judgment of merit and demerit,
continue to subsist, inviolable and imprescriptible; and we cannot help
but believe that He Who has implanted in us the sentiment and idea of
order, cannot therein Himself be wanting; and that He will, sooner or
later, re-establish the holy harmony of virtue and happiness, by means
belonging to Himself.

The Judgment of the Good, the decision that such a thing is goad, and
that such another is not,--this is the primitive fact, and reposes on
itself. By its intimate resemblances to the judgment of the true and the
beautiful, it shows us the secret affinities of morality, metaphysics,
and esthetics. The good, so especially

<span id="page_725">p. 725</span>

united to the true, is distinguished from it, only because it is truth
put in practice. The good is obligatory. These are two indivisible but
not identical ideas. The idea of obligation reposes on the idea of the
Good. In this intimate alliance, the former borrows from the latter its
universal and absolute character.

The obligatory good is the moral law. That is the foundation of all
morality. By it we separate ourselves from the morality of interest and
the morality of sentiment. We admit the existence of those facts, and
their influence; but we do not assign them the same rank.

To the moral law, in the reason of man, corresponds liberty in action.
Liberty is deduced from obligation, and is a fact irresistibly evident.
Man, as free, and subject to obligation, is a moral person; and that
involves the idea of rights. To these ideas is added that of merit and
demerit; which supposes the distinction between good and evil,
obligation and liberty; and creates the idea of reward and punishment.

The sentiments play no unimportant part in morality. All the moral
judgments are accompanied by sentiments that respond to them. From the
secret sources of enthusiasm the human will draws the mysterious virtue
that makes heroes. Truth enlightens and illumines. Sentiment warms and
inclines to action. Interest also bears its part; and the hope of
happiness is the work of God, and one of the motive powers of human
action.

Such is the admirable economy of the moral constitution of man. His
Supreme Object, the Good: his law, Virtue, which often imposes upon him
suffering, thus making him to excel all other created beings known to
us. But this law is harsh, and in contradiction with the instinctive
desire for happiness. Wherefore the Beneficent Author of his being has
placed in his soul, by the side of the severe law of duty, the sweet,
delightful force of sentiment. Generally he attaches happiness to
virtue; and for the exceptions, for such there are, he has placed Hope
at the end of the journey to be travelled.

Thus there is a side on which morality touches religion. It is a sublime
necessity of Humanity to see in God the Legislator supremely wise, the
Witness always present, the infallible judge of virtue. The human mind,
ever climbing up to God, would deem the foundations of morality too
unstable, if it did not place in God the first principle of the moral
law. Wishing to give to the

<span id="page_726">p. 726</span>

moral law a religious character, we run the risk of taking from it its
moral character. We may refer it so entirely to God as to make His will
an arbitrary degree. But the will of God, whence we deduce morality, in
order to give it authority, itself has no moral authority, except as it
is just. The Good comes from the will of God alone; but from His will,
in so far as it is the expression of His wisdom and justice. The Eternal
Justice of God is the sole foundation of Justice, such as Humanity
perceives and practises it. The Good, duty, merit and demerit, are
referred to God, as everything is referred to him; but they have none
the less a proper evidence and authority. Religion is the crown of
Morality, not its base. The base of Morality is in itself.

The Moral Code of Masonry is still more extensive than that developed by
philosophy. To the requisitions of the law of Nature and the law of God,
it adds the imperative obligation of a con-tract. Upon entering the
Order, the Initiate binds to himself every Mason in the world. Once
enrolled among the children of Light, every Mason on earth becomes his
brother, and owes him the duties, the kindnesses, and the sympathies of
a brother. On every one he may call for assistance in need, protection
against danger, sympathy in sorrow, attention in sickness, and decent
burial after death. There is not a Mason in the world who is not bound
to go to his relief, when he is in danger, if there be a greater
probability of saving his life than of losing his own. No Mason can
wrong him to the value of anything, knowingly, himself, nor suffer it to
be done by others, if it be in his power to prevent it. No Mason can
speak evil of him, to his face or behind his back. Every Mason must keep
his lawful secrets, and aid him in his business, defend his character
when unjustly assailed, and protect, counsel, and assist his widow and
his orphans. What so many thousands owe to him, he owes to each of them.
He has solemnly bound himself to be ever ready to discharge this sacred
debt. If he fails to do it he is dishonest and forsworn; and it is an
unparalleled meanness in him to obtain good offices by false pretences,
to receive kindness and service, rendered him under the confident
expectation that he will in his turn render the same, and then to
disappoint, without ample reason, that just expectation.

Masonry holds him also, by his solemn promise, to a purer life, a nobler
generosity, a more perfect charity of opinion and action; to be
tolerant, catholic in his love for his race, ardent in his zeal

<span id="page_727">p. 727</span>

for the interest of mankind, the advancement and progress of humanity.

Such are, we think, the Philosophy and the Morality, such the TRUE WORD
of a Master Mason.

The world, the ancients believed, was governed by Seven Secondary
Causes; and these were the universal forces, known to the Hebrews by the
plural name ELOHIM. These forces, analogous and contrary one to the
other, produce equilibrium by their contrasts, and regulate the
movements of the spheres. The Hebrews called them the Seven great
Archangels, and gave them names, each of which, being a combination of
another word with AL, the first Phœnician Nature-God, considered as the
Principle of Light, represented them as His manifestations. Other
peoples assigned to these Spirits the government of the Seven Planets
then known, and gave them the names of their great divinities.

So, in the Kabala, the last Seven Sephiroth constituted ATIK YOMIN, the
Ancient of Days; and these, as well as the Seven planets, correspond
with the Seven colors separated by the prism, and the Seven notes of the
musical octave.

Seven is the sacred number in all theogonies and all symbols, because it
is composed of 3 and 4. It represents the magical. power in its full
force. It is the Spirit assisted by all the Elementary Powers, the Soul
served by Nature, the Holy Empire spoken of in the clavicules of
Solomon, symbolized by a warrior, crowned, bearing a triangle on his
cuirass, and standing on a cube, to which are harnessed two Sphinxes,
one white and the other black, pulling contrary ways, and turning the
head to look backward.

The vices are Seven, like the virtues; and the latter were anciently
symbolized by the Seven Celestial bodies then known as planets. FAITH,
as the converse of arrogant Confidence, was represented by the *Sun*;
HOPE, enemy of Avarice, by the *Moon*; CHARITY, opposed to Luxury, by
*Venus*; FORCE, stronger than Rage, by *Mars*; PRUDENCE, the opposite of
Indolence, by *Mercury*; TEMPERANCE, the antipodes of Gluttony, by
*Saturn*; and JUSTICE, the opposite of Envy, by *Jupiter*.

The Kabalistic book of the Apocalypse is represented as closed with
Seven Seals. In it we find the Seven genii of the Ancient Mythologies;
and the doctrine concealed under its emblems is the pure Kabala, already
lost by the Pharisees at the advent of the Saviour. The pictures that
follow in this wondrous epic are so

<span id="page_728">p. 728</span>

many pantacles, of which the numbers 3, 4, 7, and 12 are the keys.

The Cherub, or symbolic bull, which Moses places at the gate of the
Edenic world, holding a blazing sword, is a Sphinx, with the body of a
bull and a human head; the old Assyrian Sphinx whereof the combat and
victory of Mithras were the hieroglyphic analysis. This armed Sphinx
represents the law of the Mystery, which keeps watch at the door of
initiation, to repulse the Profane. It also represents the grand Magical
Mystery, all the elements whereof the number 7 expresses, still without
giving its last word. This "unspeakable word" of the Sages of the school
of Alexandria, this word, which the Hebrew Kabalists wrote; ‏ו ?Y?H?W?H‎
\[IHUH\], and translated by ‏ו ?A?R?A?R?Y?Tה?A‎, \[ARARITA,\] so
expressing the threefoldness of the Secondary Principle, the dualism of
the middle ones, and the Unity as well of the first Principle as of the
end; and also the junction of the number 3 with the number 4 in a word
composed of four letters, but formed of seven by one triplicate and two
repeated,--this word is pronounced *Ararita*.

The vowels in the Greek language are also Seven in number, and were used
to designate the Seven planets.

Tsadok or Sydyc was the Supreme God in Phœnicia. His Seven Sons were
probably the Seven Cabiri; and he was the Heptaktis, the God of Seven
Rays.

Kronos, the Greek Saturn, Philo makes Sanchoniathon say, had six sons,
and by Astarte Seven daughters, the Titanides. The Persians adored Ahura
Masda or Ormuzd and the Six Amshaspands, the first three of whom were
Lords of the Empires of Light, Fire, and Splendor; the Babylonians, Bal
and the Gods; the Chinese, Shangti, and the Six Chief Spirits; and the
Greeks, Kronos, and the Six great Male Gods, his progeny, Zeus,
Poseidon, Apollo, Are\_s, He\_phaistos, and Hermes; while the female
deities were also Seven: Rhea, wife of Kronos, He\_re\_, Athe\_ne\_,
Artemis, Aphrodite\_, Hestia, and De\_me\_te\_i. In the Orphic Theogony,
Gaia produced the fourteen Titans, Seven male and Seven female, Kronos
being the most potent of the males; and as the number *Seven* appears in
these, nine by threes, or the triple triangle, is found in the three
Mœraê or Fates, the three Centimane\_s, and the three Cyclope\_s,
offspring of Ouranos and Gaia, or Heaven and Earth.

The metals, like the colors, were deemed to be Seven in number, and a
metal and color were assigned to each planet. Of

<span id="page_729">p. 729</span>

the metals, gold was assigned to the Sun and silver to the Moon.

The palace of Deioces in Ecbatana had Seven circular walls of different
colors, the two innermost having their battlements covered respectively
with silvering and gilding.

And the Seven Spheres of Borsippa were represented by the Seven Stories,
each of a different color, of the tower or truncated pyramid of Bel at
Babylon.

Pharaoh saw in his dream, which Joseph interpreted, *Seven* ears of
wheat on one stalk, full and good, and after them *Seven* ears,
withered, thin, and blasted with the East wind; and the Seven thin ears
devoured the Seven good ears; and Joseph interpreted these to mean Seven
years of plenty succeeded by Seven years of famine.

Connected with this Ebn Hesham relates that a flood of rain laid bare to
view a sepulchre in Yemen, in which lay a woman having on her neck
*Seven* collars of *pearls*, and on her hands and feet bracelets and
ankle-rings and armlets, Seven on each, with an inscription on a tablet
showing that, after attempting in vain to purchase grain of Joseph, she,
Tajah, daughter of Dzu Shefar, and her people, died of famine.

Hear again the words of an adept, who had profoundly studied the
mysteries of science, and wrote, as the Ancient Oracles spoke, in
enigmas; but who knew that the theory of mechanical forces and of the
materiality of the most potent agents of Divinity, explains nothing, and
ought to satisfy no one!

Through the veil of all the hieratic and mystic allegories of the
ancient dogmas, under the seal of all the sacred writings, in the ruins
of Nineveh or Thebes, on the worn stones of the ancient temples, and on
the blackened face of the sphinx of Assyria or Egypt, in the monstrous
or marvellous pictures which the sacred pages of the Vedas translate for
the believers of India, in the strange emblems of our old books of
alchemy, in the ceremonies of reception practised by all the mysterious
Societies, we find the traces of a doctrine, everywhere the same, and
everywhere carefully concealed. The occult philosophy seems to have been
the nurse or the godmother of all religions, the secret lever of all the
intellectual forces, the key of all divine obscurities, and the absolute
Queen of Society, in the ages when it was exclusively reserved for the
education of the Priests and Kings.

<span id="page_730">p. 730</span>

It had reigned in Persia with the Magi, who perished one day, as the
masters of the world had perished, for having abused their power. It had
endowed India with the most marvellous traditions, and an incredible
luxury of poetry, grace, and terror in its emblems: it had civilized
Greece by the sounds of the lyre of Orpheus: it hid the principles of
all the sciences, and of the whole progression of the human spirit, in
the audacious calculations of Pythagoras: fable teemed with its
miracles; and history, when it undertook to judge of this unknown power,
confounded itself with fable: it shook or enfeebled empires by its
oracles; made tyrants turn pale on their thrones, and ruled over all
minds by means of curiosity or fear. To this science, said the crowd,
nothing is impossible; it commands the elements, knows the language of
the planets, and controls the movements of the stars; the moon, at its
voice, falls, reeking with blood, from Heaven; the dead rise upright on
their graves, and shape into fatal words the wind that breathes through
their skulls. Controller of Love or Hate, this science can at pleasure
confer on human hearts Paradise or Hell: it disposes at will of all
forms, and distributes beauty or deformity as it pleases: it changes in
turn, with the rod of Circe, men into brutes and animals into men: it
even disposes of Life or of Death, and can bestow on its adepts riches
by the transmutation of metals, and immortality by its quintessence and
elixir, compounded of gold and light.

This is what magic had been, from Zoroaster to Manes, from Orpheus to
Apollonius Thyaneus; when positive Christianity, triumphing over the
splendid dreams and gigantic aspirations of the school of Alexandria,
publicly crushed this philosophy with its anathemas, and compelled it to
become more occult and more mysterious than ever.

At the bottom of magic, nevertheless, was science, as at the bottom of
Christianity there was love; and in the Evangelic Symbols we see the
incarnate WORD adored in its infancy by three magi whom a star guides
(the ternary and the sign of the microcosm), and receiving from them
gold frankincense, and myrrh; another mysterious ternary, under the
emblem whereof are allegorically contained the highest secrets of the
Kabala.

Christianity should not have hated magic; but human ignorance always
fears the unknown. Science was obliged to conceal itself, to avoid the
impassioned aggressions of a blind love. It

<span id="page_731">p. 731</span>

enveloped itself in new hieroglyphs, concealed its efforts, disguised
its hopes. Then was created the jargon of alchemy, a continual deception
for the vulgar herd, greedy of gold, and a living language for the true
disciples of Hermes alone.

Resorting to Masonry, the alchemists there invented Degrees, and partly
unveiled their doctrine to their Initiates; not by the language of their
receptions, but by oral instruction afterward; for their rituals, to one
who has not the key, are but incomprehensible and absurd jargon.

Among the sacred books of the Christians are two works which the
infallible church does not pretend to understand, and never attempts to
explain,--the prophecy of Ezekiel and the Apocalypse; two cabalistic
clavicules, reserved, no doubt, in Heaven, for the exposition of the
Magian kings; closed with Seven seals for all faithful believers; and
perfectly clear to the unbeliever initiated in the occult sciences.

For Christians, and in their opinion, the scientific and magical
clavicules of Solomon are lost. Nevertheless, it is certain that, in the
domain of intelligence governed by the WORD, nothing that is written is
lost. Only those things which men cease to understand no longer exist
for them, at least as WORD; then they enter into the domain of enigmas
and mystery.

The mysterious founder of the Christian Church was saluted in His cradle
by the three Magi, that is to say by the hieratic ambassadors from the
three parts of the known world, and from the three analogical worlds of
the occult philosophy.

In the school of Alexandria, Magic and Christianity almost take each
other by the hand under the auspices of Ammonius Saccos and Plato. The
dogma of Hermes is found almost entire in the writings attributed to
Dionysius the Areopagite. Synesius traces the plan of a treatise on
dreams, which was subsequently to be commented on by Cardan, and
composes hymns which might serve for the liturgy of the Church of
Swedenborg, if a church of illuminati could have a liturgy.

To this epoch of ardent abstractions and impassioned logomachies belongs
the philosophical reign of Julian, an illuminatus and Initiate of the
first order, who believed in the unity of God and the universal Dogma of
the Trinity, and regretted the loss of nothing of the old world but its
magnificent symbols and too graceful images. He was no Pagan, but a
Gnostic, infected with

<span id="page_732">p. 732</span>

the allegories of Grecian polytheism, and whose misfortune it was to
find the name of Jesus Christ less sonorous than that of Orpheus.

We may be sure that so soon as Religion and Philosophy become distinct
departments, the mental activity of the age is in advance of its Faith;
and that, though habit may sustain the latter for a time, its vitality
is gone.

The dunces who led primitive Christianity astray, by substituting faith
for science, reverie for experience, the fantastic for the reality; and
the inquisitors who for so many ages waged against Magism a war of
extermination, have succeeded in shrouding in darkness the ancient
discoveries of the human mind; so that we now grope in the dark to find
again the key of the phenomena of nature. But all natural phenomena
depend on a single and immutable law, represented by the philosophal
stone and its symbolic form, which is that of a cube. This law,
expressed in the Kabala by the number 4, furnished the Hebrews with all
the mysteries of their divine Tetragram.

Everything is contained in that word of four letters. It is the *Azot*
of the Alchemists, the *Thot* of the Bohemians, the *Taro* of the
Kabalists. It supplies to the Adept the last word of the human Sciences,
and the Key of the Divine Power: but he alone understands how to avail
himself of it who comprehends the necessity of never revealing it. If
Œdipus, in place of *slaying* the Sphynx, had *conquered* it, and driven
it into Thebes harnessed to his chariot, he would have been King,
without incest, calamities, or exile. If Psyche, by submission and
caresses, had persuaded Love to reveal himself, she would never have
lost him. Love is one of the mythological images of the grand secret and
the grand agent, because it expresses at once an action and a passion, a
void and a plenitude, an arrow and a wound. The Initiates ought to
understand this, and, lest the profane should overhear, Masonry never
says too much.

When Science had been overcome in Alexandria by the fanaticism of the
murderers of Hypatia, it became Christian, or, rather, it concealed
itself under Christian disguises, with Ammonius, Synosius, and the
author of the books of Dionysius the Areopagite. Then it was necessary
to win the pardon of miracles by the appearances of superstition, and of
science by a language unintelligible. Hieroglyphic writing was revived,
and pantacles and

<span id="page_733">p. 733</span>

characters were invented, that summed up a whole doctrine in a sign, a
whole series of tendencies and revelations in a word. What was the
object of the aspirants to knowledge? They sought for the secret of the
great work, or the Philosophal Stone, or the perpetual motion, or the
squaring of the circle, or the universal medicine; formulas which often
saved them from persecution and general ill-will, by exposing them to
the charge of folly; and each of which expressed one of the forces of
the grand magical secret. This lasted until the time of the Roman de la
Rose, which also expresses the mysterious and magical meaning of the
poem of Dante, borrowed from the High Kabalah, that immense and
concealed source of the universal philosophy.

It is not strange that man knows but little of the powers of the human
will, and imperfectly appreciates them; since he knows nothing as to the
nature of the will and its mode of operation. That his own will can move
his arm, or compel another to obey him; that his thoughts, symbolically
expressed by the signs of writing, can influence and lead other men, are
mysteries as incomprehensible to him, as that the will of Deity could
effect the creation of a Universe.

The powers of the will are as yet chiefly indefinite and unknown.
Whether a multitude of well-established phenomena are to be ascribed to
the power of the will alone, or to magnetism or some other natural
agent, is a point as yet unsettled; but it is agreed by all that a
concentrated effort of the will is in every case necessary to success.

That the phenomena are real is not to be doubted, unless credit is no
longer to be given to human testimony; and if they are real, there is no
reason for doubting the exercise heretofore, by many adepts, of the
powers that were then termed magical. Nothing is better vouched for than
the extraordinary performances of the Brahmins. No religion is supported
by stronger testimony; nor has any one ever even attempted to explain
what may well be termed their miracles.

How far, in this life, the mind and soul can act without and
in-dependently of the body, no one as yet knows. That the will can act
at all without bodily contact, and the phenomena of dreams, are
mysteries that confound the wisest and most learned, whose explanations
are but a Babel of words.

Man as yet knows little of the forces of nature. Surrounded,

<span id="page_734">p. 734</span>

controlled, and governed by them, while he vainly thinks himself
independent, not only of his race, but the universal nature and her
infinite manifold forces, he is the slave of these forces, unless he
becomes their master. He can neither ignore their existence nor be
simply their neighbor.

There is in nature one most potent force, by means whereof a single man,
who could possess himself of it, and should know how to direct it, could
revolutionize and change the face of the world.

This force was known to the ancients. It is a universal agent, whose
Supreme law is equilibrium; and whereby, if science can but learn how to
control it, it will be possible to change the order of the Seasons, to
produce in night the phenomena of day, to send a thought in an instant
round the world, to heal or slay at a distance, to give our words
universal success, and make them reverberate everywhere.

This agent, partially revealed by the blind guesses of the disciples of
Mesmer, is precisely what the Adepts of the middle ages called the
elementary matter of the great work. The Gnostics held that it composed
the igneous body of the Holy Spirit; and it was adored in the secret
rites of the Sabbat or the Temple, under the hieroglyphic figure of
Baphomet or the hermaphroditic goat of Mendes.

There is a Life-Principle of the world, a universal agent, wherein are
two natures and a double current, of love and wrath. This ambient fluid
penetrates everything. It is a ray detached from the glory of the Sun,
and fixed by the weight of the atmosphere and the central attraction. It
is the body of the Holy Spirit, the universal Agent, the Serpent
devouring his own tail. With this electro-magnetic ether, this vital and
luminous caloric, the ancients and the alchemists were familiar. Of this
agent, that phase of modern ignorance termed physical science talks
incoherently, knowing naught of it save its effects; and theology might
apply to it all its pretended definitions of spirit. Quiescent, it is
appreciable by no human sense; disturbed or in movement, none can
explain its mode of action; and to term it a "fluid," and speak of its
"currents," is but to veil a profound ignorance under a cloud of words.

Force attracts force, life attracts life, health attracts health. It is
a law of nature.

<span id="page_735">p. 735</span>

If two children live together, and still more if they sleep together,
and one is feeble and the other strong, the strong will absorb the
feeble, and the latter will perish.

In schools, some pupils absorb the intellect of the others, and in every
circle of men some one individual is soon found, who possesses himself
of the wills of the others.

Enthralments by currents is very common; and one is carried away by the
crowd, in morals as in physics. The human will has an almost absolute
power in determining one's acts; and every external demonstration of a
will has an influence on external things.

Tissot ascribed most maladies to disorders of the will, or the perverse
influences of the wills of others. We become subject to the wills of
others by the analogies of our inclinations, and still more by those of
our defects. To caress the weaknesses of an individual, is to possess
ourself of him, and make of him an instrument in the order of the same
errors or depravations. But when two natures, analogical in defects, are
subordinated one to the other, there is effected a kind of substitution
of the stronger instead of the weaker, and a genuine imprisonment of one
mind by the other. Often the weaker struggles, and would fain revolt;
and then falls lower than ever in servitude.

We each have some dominant defect, by which the enemy can grasp us. In
some it is vanity, in others indolence, in most egotism. Let a cunning
and evil spirit possess himself of this, and you are lost. Then you
become, not foolish, nor an idiot, but positively a lunatic, the slave
of an impulse from without. You have an instinctive horror for
everything that could restore you to reason, and will not even listen to
representations that contravene your insanity.

Miracles are the natural effects of exceptional causes.

The immediate action of the human will on bodies, or at least this
action exercised without visible means, constitutes a miracle in the
physical order.

The influence exercised on wills or intellects, suddenly or within a
given time, and capable of taking captive the thoughts, changing the
firmest resolutions, paralyzing the most violent passions, constitutes a
miracle in the moral order.

The common error in relation to miracles is, to regard them as effects
without causes; as contradictions of nature; as sudden fictions of the
Divine imagination; and men do not reflect that a

<span id="page_736">p. 736</span>

single miracle of this sort would break the universal harmony and
re-plunge the Universe into Chaos.

There are miracles impossible to God Himself: absurd miracles are so. If
God could be absurd for a single instant, neither He nor the Universe
would exist an instant afterward. To expect of the Divine Free-Will an
effect whose cause is unacknowledged or does not exist, is what is
termed tempting God. It is to precipitate one's self into the void.

God acts by His works: in Heaven, by angels; on earth, by men.

In the heaven of human conceptions, it is humanity that creates God; and
men think that God has made them in His image, because they make Him in
theirs.

The domain of man is all corporeal nature, visible on earth; and if he
does not rule the planets or the stars, he can at least calculate their
movement, measure their distances, and identify his will with their
influence: he can modify the atmosphere, act to a certain point on the
seasons, cure and afflict with sickness other men, preserve life and
cause death.

The absolute in reason and will is the greatest power which it is given
to men to attain; and it is by means of this power that what the
multitude admires under the name of miracles, are effected.

POWER is the wise use of the will, which makes Fatality itself serve to
accomplish the purposes of Sages.

Omnipotence is the most absolute Liberty; and absolute Liberty cannot
exist without a perfect equilibrium; and the columns JACHIN and BOAZ are
also the unlimited POWER and SPLENDOR OF PERFECTION of the Deity, the
seventh and eighth SEPHIROTH of the Kabalah, from whose equilibrium
result the eternal permanence and Stability of His plans and works, and
of that perfect Success and undivided, unlimited Dominion, which are the
ninth and tenth SEPHIROTH, and of which the Temple of Solomon, in its
stately symmetry, erected without the sound of any tool of metal being
heard, is to us a symbol. "For Thine," says the Most Perfect of Prayers,
"is the DOMINION, the POWER, and the GLORY, during all the ages! Amen!"

The ABSOLUTE is the very *necessity* of BEING, the immutable law of
Reason and of Truth. It is THAT WHICH IS. BUT THAT WHICH IS is in some
sort before HE WHO IS. God Himself is not without *a reason of
existence*. He does not exist accidentally. He could not *not* have
been. His Existence, then, is *necessitated*,

<span id="page_737">p. 737</span>

is *necessary*. He *can* exist only in virtue of a Supreme and
inevitable REASON. That REASON, then, is THE ABSOLUTE; for it is in IT
we must believe, if we would that our faith should have a reasonable and
solid basis. It has been said in our times, that God is a Hypothesis;
but Absolute Reason is not one: it is essential to Existence.

Saint Thomas said, "*A thing is not just because God wills it*, BUT GOD
WILLS IT BECAUSE IT IS JUST." If he had deduced all the consequences of
this fine thought, he would have discovered the true Philosopher's
Stone; the magical elixir, to convert all the trials of the world into
golden mercies. Precisely as it is a necessity for God to BE, so it is a
necessity for Him to be just, loving, and merciful. He cannot be unjust,
cruel, merciless. He cannot repeal the law of right and wrong, of merit
and demerit; for the moral laws are as absolute as the physical laws.
There are impossible things. As it is impossible to make two and two be
five and not four; as it is impossible to make a thing be and not be at
the same time; so it is impossible for the Deity to make crime a merit,
and love and gratitude crimes. So, too, it was impossible to make Man
perfect, with his bodily senses and appetites, as it was to make his
nerves susceptible of pleasure and not also of pain.

Therefore, according to the idea of Saint Thomas, the moral laws are the
*enactments* of the Divine WILL, only because they are the *decisions*
of the Absolute WISDOM and REASON, and the *Revelations* of the Divine
NATURE. In this alone consists the *right* of Deity to enact them; and
thus only do we attain the certainty in Faith that the Universe is one
Harmony.

To believe in the Reason of God, and in the God of Reason, is to make
Atheism impossible. It is the Idolaters who have made the Atheists.

Analogy gives the Sage all the forces of Nature. It is the key of the
Grand Arcanum, the root of the Tree of Life, the science of Good and
Evil.

The Absolute, is REASON. Reason IS, by means of Itself. It IS BECAUSE IT
IS, and not because we suppose it. IT IS, where nothing *exists*; but
nothing could possibly exist without IT. Reason is Necessity, Law, the
Rule of all Liberty, and the direction of every Initiative. If God IS,
HE IS by Reason. The conception of an Absolute Deity, outside of, or
independent of, Reason, is the IDOL of Black Magic, the PHANTOM of the
Dæmon.

<span id="page_738">p. 738</span>

The Supreme Intelligence is necessarily *rational*. God, in philosophy,
can be no more than a Hypothesis; but a Hypothesis imposed by good sense
on Human Reason. To personify the Absolute Reason, is to determine the
Divine Ideal.

NECESSITY, LIBERTY, and REASON! Behold the great and Supreme Triangle of
the Kabalists!

FATALITY, WILL, and POWER! Such is the magical ternary which, in human
things, corresponds with the Divine Triangle.

FATALITY is the inevitable linking together, in succession, of effects
and causes, in a given order.

WILL is the faculty that directs the forces of the Intellect, so as to
reconcile the liberty of persons with the necessity of things.

The argument from these premises must be made by yourself. Each one of
us does that. "Seek," say the Holy Writings, "and ye shall find." Yet
discussion is not forbidden; and without doubt the subject will be fully
treated of in your hearing hereafter. Affirmation, negation,
discussion,--it is by these the truth is attained.

To explore the great Mysteries of the Universe and seek to solve its
manifold enigmas, is the chief use of Thought, and constitutes the
principal distinction between Man and the animals. Accordingly, in all
ages the Intellect has labored to understand and explain to itself the
Nature of the Supreme Deity.

That one Reason and one Will created and governed the Universe was too
evident not to be at once admitted by the *philosophers* of all ages. It
was the ancient *religions* that sought to multiply gods. The *Nature*
of the One Deity, and the mode in which the Universe had its beginning,
are questions that have always been the racks in which the human
intellect has been tortured: and it is chiefly with these that the
Kabalists have dealt.

It is true that, in one sense, we can have no actual knowledge of the
Absolute Itself, the *very* Deity. Our means of obtaining what is
commonly termed *actual* knowledge, are our senses only. If to *see* and
*feel* be *knowledge*, we have none of our own Soul, of electricity, of
magnetism. We see and feel and taste an acid or an alkali, and know
something of the *qualities* of each; but it is only when we use them in
combination with other substances, and learn their *effects*, that we
really begin to know their *nature*. It is the combination and
experiments of Chemistry that give

<span id="page_739">p. 739</span>

as a knowledge of the nature and powers of most animal and vegetable
substances. As these are cognizable by inspection by our senses, we may
partially know them by that alone: but the Soul, either of ourself or of
another, being beyond that cognizance, can only be known by the acts and
words which are its effects. Magnetism and electricity, when at rest,
are equally beyond the jurisdiction of the senses; and when they are in
action, we see, feel, hear, taste, and smell only their effects. We do
not know what they *are*, but only what they *do*. We can know the
attributes of Deity only through His manifestations. To ask anything
more, is to ask, not *knowledge*, but something else, for which we have
no name. God is a Power; and we know nothing of any Power *itself*, but
only its effects, results, and action, and what Reason teaches us by
analogy;

In these later days, in laboring to escape from all *material* ideas in
regard to Deity, we have so refined away our notions of GOD, as to have
no idea of Him at all. In struggling to regard Him as a pure immaterial
Spirit, we have made the word *Spirit* synonymous with *nothing*, and
can only say that He is a *Somewhat*, with certain attributes, such as
Power, Wisdom, and Intelligence. To compare Him to LIGHT, would now be
deemed not only unphilosophical, but the equivalent of Atheism; and we
find it necessary to excuse and pity the ancients for their inadequate
and gross ideas of Deity, expressed in considering Him as the
Light-Principle, the invisible essence or substance from which visible
Light flows.

Yet our own holy writings continually speak of Him as Light; and
therefore the Tsabeans and the Kabala may well be pardoned for doing the
same; especially since they did not regard Him as the *visible* Light
known to us, but as the Primordial Ether-Ocean from which light flows.

Before the creation, did the Deity dwell alone in the Darkness, or in
the Light? Did the Light co-exist with Him, or was it created, after an
eternity of darkness? and if it co-existed, was it an effluence from
Him, filling all space as He also filled it, He and the Light at the
same time filling the same place and every place?

MILTON says, expressing the Hebraic doctrine:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Hail, Holy Light, offspring of Heaven first-born,  
Or of th’ Eternal, co-eternal beam!  
May I express thee unblamed, *since God is Light*. <span
id="page_740">p. 740</span>  
And never but in unapproached Light  
Dwelt from Eternity; dwelt then in Thee,  
*Bright effluence of bright Essence uncreate*."</span>

</div>

"The LIGHT," says the Book *Omschim*, or Introduction to the Kabala,
"Supremest of all things, and most Lofty, and Limitless, and styled
INFINITE, can be attained unto by no cogitation or speculation; and its
VERY SELF is evidently withdrawn and removed beyond all intellection. It
WAS, before all things whatever, produced, created, formed, and made by
Emanation; and in it was neither Time, Head, or Beginning; since it
always existed, and remains forever, without commencement or end."

"Before the Emanations flowed forth, and created things were created,
the Supreme Light was infinitely extended, and filled the whole WHERE;
so that with reference to Light no vacuum could be affirmed, nor any
unoccupied space; but the ALL was filled with that Light of the
Infinite, thus extended, whereto in every regard was no end, inasmuch as
nothing was, except that extended Light, which, with a certain single
and simple equality, was everywhere like unto itself."

AINSOPH is called *Light*, says the Introduction to the Sohar, because
it is impossible to express it by any other word.

To conceive of God as an actuality, and not as a mere non-substance or
name, which involved non-*existence*, the Kabala, like the Egyptians,
imagined Him to be "a most occult Light," AUR; not our material and
visible Light, but the Substance out of which Light flows, the *fire*,
as relative to its heat and flame. Of this Light or Ether, the Sun was
to the Tsabeans the only manifestation or out-shining, and as such it
was worshipped, and not as the type of dominion and power. God was the
*Pho\_s Noe\_ton*, the Light cognizable only by the Intellect, the
Light-Principle, the Light-Ether, from which souls emanate, and to which
they return.

Light, Fire, and Flame, with the Phœnicians, were the sons of Kronos.
They are the Trinity in the Chaldæan Oracles, the AOR of the Deity,
manifested in *flame*, that issues out of the invisible *Fire*.

In the first three Persian Amshaspands, Lords of LIGHT, FIRE, and
SPLENDOR, we recognize the AOR, ZOHAR, and ZAYO, *Light*, *Splendor*,
and *Brightness*, of the Kabalah. The first of these is termed AOR
MUPALA, *Wonderful or Hidden Light*, unrevealed, undisplayed--which is
KETHER, the first Emanation or *Sephirah*,

<span id="page_741">p. 741</span>

the *Will* of Deity: the second is NESTAR, *Concealed*--which is
HAKEMAH, the second *Sephirah*, or the Intellectual Potence of the
Deity: and the third is METANOTSATS, *coruscating*--which is BINAH, the
third *Sephirah*, or the intellectual *producing* capacity. In other
words, they are THE VERY SUBSTANCE of light, *in* the Deity: *Fire*,
which is that light, limited and furnished with attributes, so that it
*can* be revealed, but yet remains unrevealed, and its *splendor* or
out-shining, or the *light* that goes out from the fire.

Masonry is a search after Light. That search leads us directly back, as
you see, to the Kabalah. In that ancient and little understood medley of
absurdity and philosophy, the Initiate will find the source of many
doctrines; and may in time come to understand the Hermetic philosophers,
the Alchemists, all the Anti-papal Thinkers of the Middle Ages, and
Emanuel Swedenborg.

The Hansavati Rich, a celebrated Sanscrit Stanza, says: "He is Hansa
(the Sun), dwelling in light; Vasu, the atmosphere dwelling in the
firmament; the invoker of the gods (Agni), dwelling on the altar
(*i.e.*, the altar fire); the guest (of the worshipper), dwelling in the
house (the domestic fire); the dweller amongst men (as consciousness);
the dweller in the most excellent orb, (the Sun); the dweller in truth;
the dweller in the sky (the air); born in the waters, in the rays of
light, in the verity (of manifestation), in the Eastern mountains; the
Truth (itself)."

"In the beginning," says a Sanscrit hymn, "arose the Source of golden
light. *He was the only born Lord of all that is*. He established the
earth and the sky. Who is the God to Whom we shall offer our sacrifice?"

"He who gives life, He who gives strength; Whose blessing all the bright
gods desire; *Whose shadow is immortality; Whose shadow is death*; Who
is the God, etc?"

"He through Whom the sky is bright and the earth for us; He through Whom
the Heaven was established, nay, the highest Heaven; He who measured out
the light in the air; Who is the God, etc?"

"He to Whom the Heaven and earth, standing firm by His will, look up
trembling inwardly; He over Whom the rising sun shines forth; Who is the
God, etc?"

"Wherever the mighty water-clouds went, where they placed

<span id="page_742">p. 742</span>

the seed and lit the fire, thence arose He Who is the only life of the
bright gods; Who is the God, etc?"

The WORD of God, said the Indian philosophy, is the universal 'and
invisible Light, cognizable by the senses, that emits its blaze in the
Sun, Moon, Planets, and other Stars. Philo calls it the "Universal
Light," which loses a portion of its purity and splendor in descending
from the intellectual to the sensible world, manifesting itself
outwardly from the Deity; and the Kabalah represents that only so much
of the Infinite Light flowed into the circular void prepared for
creation within the Infinite Light and Wisdom, as could pass by a canal
like a line or thread. The Sephiroth, emanating from the Deity, were the
rays of His splendor.

The Chaldæan Oracles said: "The intellect of the Generator, stirred to
action, out-spoke, forming within itself, by intellection, universals of
every possible form and fashion, which issued out, flowing forth from
the One Source . . . For Deity, impersonated as Dominion, before
fabricating the manifold Universe, posited an intellected and
unchangeable universal, the impression of the form whereof goes forth
through the Universe; and that Universe, formed and fashioned
accordingly, becomes visibly beautified in infinitely varying types and
forms, the Source and fountain whereof is one. . . . Intellectual
conceptions and forms from the Generative source, succeeding each other,
considered in relation to ever-progressing Time, and intimately
partaking of THE PRIMAL ETHER or FIRE; but yet all these Universals and
Primal Types and Ideas flowed forth from, and are part of, the first
Source of the Generative Power, perfect in itself."

The Chaldæans termed the Supreme Deity ARAOR, Father of Light. From Him
was supposed to flow the light above the world, which illuminates the
heavenly regions. This Light or Fire was considered as the Symbol of the
Divine Essence, extending itself to inferior spiritual natures. Hence
the Chaldæan oracles say: "The Father took from Himself, and did not
confine His proper fire within His intellectual potency:" . . "All
things are begotten from one Fire."

The Tsabeans held that all inferior spiritual beings were emanations
from the Supreme Deity; and therefore Proclus says: "The progression of
the gods is one and continuous, proceeding downward from the
intelligible and latent unities, and terminating in the last partition
of the Divine cause."

<span id="page_743">p. 743</span>

It is impossible to speak clearly of the Divinity. Whoever attempts to
express His attributes by the help of abstractions, confines himself to
negatives, and at once loses sight of his ideas, in wandering through a
wilderness of words. To heap Superlatives on Superlatives, and call Him
*best*, *wisest*, *greatest*, is but to exaggerate qualities which- are
found in man. That there exists one only God, and that He is a Perfect
and Beneficent Being, Reason legitimately teaches us; but of the Divine
*Nature*, of the *Substance* of the Deity, of the manner of His
Existence, or of the mode of creation of His Universe, the human mind is
inadequate to form any just conception. We can affix no clear ideas to
Omnipotence, Omniscience, Infinity or Eternity; and we have no more
right to attribute intelligence to Him, than any other mental quality of
ourselves, extended indefinitely; or than we have to attribute our
senses to Him, and our bodily organs, as the Hebrew writings do.

We satisfy ourselves with negativing in the Deity everything that
constitutes existence, so far as we are capable of conceiving of
existence. Thus He becomes to us logically nothing, *Non-Ens*. The
Ancients saw no difference between that and Atheism, and sought to
conceive of Him as something real. It is a necessity of Human Nature.
The theological idea, or rather non-idea, of the Deity, is not shared or
appreciated by the unlearned. To them, God will always be The Father Who
is in Heaven, a Monarch on His Throne, a Being with human feelings and
human sympathies, angry at their misdeeds, lenient if they repent,
accessible to their supplications. It is the Humanity, far more than the
Divinity, of Christ, that makes the mass of Christians worship Him, far
more than they do the Father.

"The Light of the Substance of The Infinite," is the Kabalistic
expression. Christ was, according to Saint John, "the Light that
lighteth every man that cometh into the. world"; and "that Light was the
life of men." "The Light shone in the darkness: and the darkness
comprehended it not."

The ancient ideas in respect to Light were perhaps quite as correct as
our own. It does not appear that they ascribed to Light any of the
qualities of matter. But modern Science defines it to be a flood of
particles of *matter*, flowing or shot out from the Sun and Stars, and
moving through space to come to us. On the theories of mechanism and
force, what force of attraction here or

<span id="page_744">p. 744</span>

repulsion at the Sun or at the most distant Star could draw or drive
these impalpable, weightless, infinitely minute particles, appreciably
by the Sense of Sight alone, so far through space? What has become of
the immense aggregate of particles that have reached the earth since the
creation? Have they increased its bulk? Why cannot chemistry detect and
analyze them? If matter, why can they travel only in right lines?

No characteristic of matter belongs to Light, or Heat, or flame, or to
Galvanism, Electricity, and Magnetism. The electric spark is light, and
so is that produced by the flint, when it cuts off particles of steel.
Iron, melted or heated, radiates light; and insects, infusoria, and
decayed wood emit it. Heat is produced by friction and by pressure; to
explain which, Science tells us of *latent* Caloric, thus representing
it to us as existing without its only known distinctive quality. What
quality of matter enables lightning, blazing from the Heavens, to rend
the oak? What quality of matter enables it to make the circuit of the
earth in a score of seconds?

Profoundly ignorant of the nature of these mighty agents of Divine
Power, we conceal our ignorance by words that have no meaning; and we
might well be asked *why* Light may not be an effluence from the Deity,
as has been agreed by all the religions of all the Ages of the World.

All truly dogmatic religions have issued from the Kabalah and return to
it: everything scientific and grand in the religious dreams of all the
illuminati, Jacob Bœhme, Swedenborg, Saint-Martin, and others, is
borrowed from the Kabalah; all the Masonic associations owe to it their
Secrets and their Symbols.

The Kabalah alone consecrates the alliance of the Universal Reason and
the Divine Word; it establishes, by the counterpoises of two forces
apparently opposite, the eternal balance of being; it alone reconciles
Reason with Faith, Power with Liberty, Science with Mystery; it has the
keys of the Present, the Past, and the Future.

The Bible, with all the allegories it contains, expresses, in an
incomplete and veiled manner only, the religious science of the Hebrews.
The doctrine of Moses and the Prophets, identical at bottom with that of
the ancient Egyptians, also had its outward meaning and its veils. The
Hebrew books were written only to recall to memory the traditions; and
they were written in Symbols

<span id="page_745">p. 745</span>

unintelligible to the Profane. The Pentateuch and the prophetic poems
were merely elementary books of doctrine, morals, or liturgy; and the
hue secret and traditional philosophy was only written afterward, under
veils still less transparent. Thus was a second Bible born, unknown to,
or rather uncomprehended by, the Christians; a collection, *they* say,
of monstrous absurdities; a monument, the adept says, wherein is
everything that the genius of philosophy and that of religion have ever
formed or imagined of the sublime; a treasure surrounded by thorns; a
diamond concealed in a rough dark stone.

One is filled with admiration, on penetrating into the Sanctuary of the
Kabalah, at seeing a doctrine so logical, so simple, and at the same
time so absolute. The necessary union of ideas and signs, the
consecration of the most fundamental realities by the primitive
characters; the Trinity of Words, Letters, and Numbers; a philosophy
simple as the alphabet, profound and infinite as the Word; theorems more
complete and luminous than those of Pythagoras; a theology summed up by
counting on one's fingers; an Infinite which can be held in the hollow
of an infant's hand; ten ciphers, and twenty-two letters, a triangle, a
square, and a circle,--these are all the elements of the Kabalah. These
are the elementary principles of the written Word, reflection of that
spoken Word that created the world!

This is the doctrine of the Kabalah, with which you will no doubt seek
to make yourself acquainted, as to the Creation.

The Absolute Deity, with the Kabalists, has no name. The terms applied
to Him are ‏ו ?A?W?R ףה?Sה?W?T‎, AOR PASOT, the Most Simple \[or Pure\]
Light, "called, ‏ו ?A?Yנ ?S?Wפ‎, AYEN SOPH, or INFINITE, before any
Emanation. For then there was no space or vacant place, but all was
infinite Light."

Before the Deity created any Ideal, any limited and intelligible Nature,
or any form whatever, He was alone, and without form or similitude, and
there could be no cognition or comprehension of Him in any wise. He was
without Idea or Figure, and it is forbidden to form any Idea or Figure
of Him, neither by the letter He (‏ו ?H‎), nor by the letter Yo\_d (‏ו
?Y‎), though these are contained in the Holy Name; nor by any other
letter or point in the world.

But after He created this Idea \[this limited and
existing-in-intellection Nature, which the ten Numerations, SEPHIROTH or

<span id="page_746">p. 746</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Rays are\], of the
Medium, the First Man ADAM KADMON, He descended therein, that, by means
of this Idea, He might be called by the name TETRAGRAMMATON; that
created things might have cognition of Him, in His own likeness.

When the Infinite God willed to emit what were to flow forth, He
contracted Himself in the centre of His light, in such manner that that
most intense light should recede to a certain circumference, and on all
sides upon itself. And this is the first contraction, and termed ‏ו
?Cם?Cמ‎ *Tsemsum*.

‏ו ?A?Dמ ?Q?Dם?Wנ‎, ADAM KADMON, the Primal or First Man, is the first
Aziluthic emanant from the Infinite Light, immitted into the evacuated
Space, and from which, afterward, all the other degrees and systems had
their beginnings. It is. called the Adam prior to all the first. In it
are imparted ten spherical numerations; and thereafter issued forth the
rectilinear figure of a man in his sephirothic decade, as it were the
diameter of the said circles; as it were the axis of these spheres,
reaching from their highest point to their lowest; and from it depend
all the systems.

But now, as the Infinite Light would be too excellent and great to be
borne and endured, except through the medium of this Adam Kadmon, its
most Secret Nature preventing this, its illuminating light had again to
emanate in streams out of itself, by certain apertures, as it were, like
windows, and which are termed the ears, eyes, nostrils, and mouth.

The light proceeding from this Adam Kadmon is indeed but one; but in
proportion to its remoteness from the place of out-flowing, and to the
grades of its descent, it is more dense.

From the word ‏ו ?A?C?L‎, ATSIL, to emanate or flow forth, comes the
word ‏ו ?A?C?Y?L?W?Tה‎, ATSILOTH or Aziluth, Emanation, or the System of
Emanants. When the primal space was evacuated, the surrounding Light of
the Infinite, and the Light immitted into the void, did not touch each
other; but the Light of the Infinite flowed into that void through a
line or certain slender canal; and that Light is the Emanative and
emitting Principle, or the out-flow and origin of Emanation: but the
Light within the void is the emanant subordinate; and the two cohere
only by means of the aforesaid line.

Aziluth means specifically and principally the first system of the four
Olamoth \[‏ו ?O?Lם?W?Tה‎\], worlds or systems; which is thence called
the Aziluthic World.

<span id="page_747">p. 747</span>

The ten Sephiroth of the general Aziluthic system are ten Nekudoth or
Points.

‏ו ?A?Yן?Zפ‎ AINSOPH, AENSOPH, or AYENSOPH, is the title of the Cause of
Causes, its meaning being "*endless*," because there is no limit to Its
loftiness, and nothing can comprehend it. Sometimes, also, the name is
applied to KETHER, or the CROWN, the first emanation, because that is
the Throne of the Infinite, that is, its first and highest Seat, than
which none is higher, and because Ainsoph resides and is concealed
therein: hence it rejoices in the same name.

Before that anything was, says the *Emech Hammelech*, He, of His mere
will, proposed to Himself to make worlds . . . but at that time there
was no vacant space for worlds; but all space was filled with the light
of His Substance, which He had with fixed limits placed in the centre of
Himself, and of the parts whereof, and wherein, He was thereafter to
effect a folding together.

What then did the Lord of the Will, that most perfectly free Agent, do?
By His own estimation, He measured off within His own Substance the
width and length of a circular space to be made vacant, and wherein
might be posited the worlds aforesaid; and of that Light which was
included within the circle so measured, He compressed and folded over a
certain portion . . . and that Light He lifted higher up, and so a place
was left unoccupied by the Primal Light.

But yet was not this space left altogether empty of that Light; for the
vestiges of the Primal Light still remained in the place where Itself
had been; and they did not recede therefrom.

Before the Emanations out-flowed, and created things were created, the
Supreme Light was infinitely extended, and filled the whole *Where*:
nothing *was*, except that extended light, called AOR H’ AINSOPH, the
Light of the non-finite.

When it came into the mind of the Extended to will to make worlds, and
by forth-flowing to utter Emanations, and to emit as Light the
perfection of His active powers, and of His aspects and attributes,
which was the impelling cause of the creation of worlds; then that
Light, in some measure compressed, receded in every direction from a
particular central point, and on all sides of it drew back, and so a
certain vacuum was left, called void space, its circumference everywhere
equidistant from that point which was exactly in the centre of the space
. . . a certain void place and

<span id="page_748">p. 748</span>

space left in Mid-Infinite: a certain *Where* was thereby constituted
wherein Emanations might BE, and the Created, the Fashioned and the
Fabricated.

This world of the *garmenting*,--this circular vacant space, with the
vestiges of the withdrawn light of the Infinite yet remaining, is the
inmost garment, nearest to His substance; and to it belongs the name AOR
PENAI-AL, *Light of the Countenance of God*.

An interspace surrounds this great circle, established *between* the
light of the *very* substance, surrounding the circle on its outside,
and the substance contained *within* the circle. This is called SPLENDOR
EXCELSUS, in contradistinction to Simple Splendor.

This light "of the vestige of the garment," is said to be, relatively to
that of the vestige of the substance, like a point in the centre of a
circle. This light, a point in the centre of the Great Light, is called
Auir, Ether, or Space.

This Ether is somewhat more gross than the Light--not so Subtle--*though
not perceptible by the Senses*--is termed the Primal Ether--extends
everywhere; Philosophers call it *the Soul of the World*.

The Light so *forth-shown* from the Deity, cannot be said to be
*severed* or *diverse* from Him. "It is flashed forth from Him, and yet
all continues to be perfect unity . . . The Sephiroth, sometimes called
the *Persons* of the Deity, *are His rays*, by which He is enabled most
perfectly to manifest Himself.

The Introduction to the Book SONAR says:

The first compression was effected, in order that the Primal Light might
be upraised, and a space become vacant. The second compression occurred
when the vestiges of the removed Light remaining were compressed into
points; and that compression was effected by means of the emotion of
joy; the Deity rejoicing, it had already been said, on account of His
Holy People, thereafter to come into being; and that joy being vehement,
and a commotion and exhilaration in the Deity being caused by it, so
that He flowed forth in His delight; and of this commotion an abstract
power of judgment being generated, which is a collection of the letters
generated by the points of the vestiges of Light left within the circle.
*For He writes the finite expressions, or limited manifestations of
Himself upon the Book, in single letters*.

Like as when water or fire, it had been said, is blown upon by the wind,
it is wont to be greatly moved, and with flashes like

<span id="page_749">p. 749</span>

lightning to smite the eyes, and gleam and coruscate hither and thither,
even so The Infinite was moved within Himself, and shone and coruscated
in that circle, from the centre outward and again to the centre: and
that commotion we term exhilaration; and from that exhilaration,
variously divided within Himself, was generated the potency of
determining the fashioning of the letters.

Of that exhilaration, it had also been said, was generated the
determination of *forms*, by which determination the Infinite determined
them within Himself, as if by saying: "Let this Sphere be the appointed
place, wherein let all worlds be created!"

He, by radiating and coruscating, effected the points, so that their
sparkling should smite the eyes like lightning. Then He combined
diversely the single points, until *letters* were fashioned thereof, in
the similitude and image of those wherewith THE BLESSED had set forth
the decrees of His Wisdom.

It is not possible to attain to an understanding of the creation of man,
except by the mystery of letters; and in these worlds of The Infinite is
nothing, except the letters of the Alphabet and their combinations. All
the worlds are Letters and Names; but He Who is the Author of all, has
no name.

This world of the covering \[or *garment*--*vestimenti*\], \[that is,
the circular vacant space, with the vestiges of the removed Light of The
Infinite still remaining after the first contraction and compression\],
is the *inmost* covering, *nearest* to His substance; and to this
covering belongs the general name AUR PENIAL, *Light of the Countenance
of God*: by which we are to understand the Light of The Substance.

And after this covering was effected, He contracted it, so as to lift up
the lower moiety; . . . and this is the *third* contraction; and in this
manner He made vacant a space for the worlds, which had not the capacity
to use the great Light of the covering, the end whereof was lucid and
excellent as its beginning. And so \[by drawing up the lower half and
half the letters\], are made the *Male* and *Female*, that is, the
anterior and posterior adhering mutually to one another.

The vacant space effected by this retraction is called AUIR KADMON, the
PRIMAL SPACE: for it was the first of all Spaces; nor was it allowable
to call it *covering*, which is AUR PENI-BAL, the Light of the
Countenance of God.

<span id="page_750">p. 750</span>

The vestiges of the Light of the Garment still remained there. And this
world of the garment has a name *that includes all things*, which is the
name IHUH. Before the world of the vacant space was created, HE was, and
His Name, and they alone; that is, AINSOPH and His garmenting.

The EMECH HAMMELECH says again:

The lower half of the garment \[by the third retraction\], was left
empty of the light of the garment. But the vestiges of that light
remained in the place so vacated . . . and *this* garment is called
SHEKINAH, God in-dwelling; that is, the place where ‏ו ?Y?H‎ Yo\_d He,
of the anterior \[or male\], and ‏ו ?W?H‎ Vav He, of the posterior \[or
female\], combinations of letters dwelt.

This vacant space was square, and is called the *Primal Space*; and in
Kabalah it is called *Auira Kadmah*, or *Rasimu Ailah*, The Primal
Space, or The Sublime Vestige. It is the vestige of the Light of the
Garment, with which is intermingled somewhat of the vestige of the Very
Substance. It is called *Primal Ether*, but not void Space. . . The
Light of the Vestige still remains in the place it occupied, and adheres
there, like somewhat spiritual, of extreme tenuity.

In this Ether are two Lights; that is, the Light of the SUBSTANCE, which
was taken away, and that of the Garment. There is a vast difference
between the two; for that of the Vestige of the Garment is, relatively
to that of the Vestige of the Substance, *like a point in the centre of
a circle*. And as the only appropriate name for the Light of the Vestige
of Ainsoph is AUR, *Light*, therefore the Light of the Vestige of the
Garment could not be called by *that* name; and so we term it a *point*,
that is, Yo\_d \[’ or ‏ו ?Y‎\], which is that point in the centre of
Light . . . and *this* Light, a point in the centre of the Great Light,
is called *Auir*, Ether, or Space.

This Ether is somewhat more gross than The Light . . . . not so subtle,
though not perceptible by the senses . . . is termed the Primal Ether .
. . extends everywhere; whence the Philosophers call it The Soul of the
World . . . Light is visible, though not perceptible. *This Ether is
neither perceptible nor visible*.

The Introduction to the Book Sohar continues, in the Section of the
Letter Yo\_d, etc:

Worlds could not be framed in this Primal Ether, on account of its
extreme tenuity and the excess of Light; and also because

<span id="page_751">p. 751</span>

in it remained the vital Spirit of the Vestige of the Light Ainsoph, and
that of the Vestige of the Light of the Garment; whereby such
manifestation was prevented.

Wherefore HE directed the letter Yo\_d, since it was not so brilliant as
the Primal Ether, to descend, and take to itself the light remaining in
the Primal Ether, and return above, with that Vestige which so impeded
the manifestation; which Yo\_d did.

It descended below five times, to remove the vital Spirit of the Vestige
of the Light Ainsoph; and the Vestige of the Light and vital Spirit of
the Garment from the Sphere of Splendor, so as to make of it ADAM,
called KADMON. And by its return, manifestation is effected in the space
below, and a Vestige of the Sublime Brilliance yet remains there,
existing as a Spherical Shape, and termed in the Sohar simply *Tehiru*,
that is, Splendor; and it is styled The First Matter. . . . it being, as
it were, vapor, and, as it were, smoke. And as smoke is formless, not
comprehended under any fixed definite form, so this Sphere is a formless
somewhat, since it seems to be somewhat that is spherical, and yet is
not limited.

The letter Yo\_d, while adhering to the Shekinah, had adhering to
himself the Light of the Shekinah, though his light was not so great as
that of the Shekinah. But when he descended, he left that light of his
own below, and the Splendor consisted of it. After which there was left
in Yo\_d only a vestige of that light, inasmuch as he could not
re-ascend to the Shekinah and adhere to it. Wherefore The Holy and
Blessed directed the letter He \[‏ו ?H‎, the female letter\], to
communicate to Yo\_d of her Light; and sent him forth, to descend and
share with *that* light in the Splendor aforesaid . . . and when he
re-descended into the Sphere of Splendor, he diffused abroad in it the
Light communicated to him by the letter He.

And when he again ascended he left behind him the productive light of
the letter He, and thereof was constituted another Sphere, *within* the
Sphere of Splendor; which *lesser* Sphere is termed in the Sohar KETHER
AILAH, CORONA SUMMA, *The Supreme Crown*, and also ATIKA DI ATIKIM,
*Antiquus Antiquum*, *The Ancient of Ancients*, and even AILIT H’ AILIT,
*Causa Causarum*, the *Cause of Causes*. But the Crown is very far
smaller than the Sphere of Splendor, so that within the latter an
immense unoccupied place and space is still left.

The BETH ALOHIM says:

Before the Infinite God, the Supreme and First Good, formed objectively
within Himself a particular conception, definite, limited, and the
object of intellection, and gave form and shape to an intellectual
conception and image. HE was alone, companionless, without form or
similitude, utterly without Ideal or Figure . . . It is forbidden to
make of Him any figure whatever, by any image in the world, neither by
the letter He nor by the letter Yo\_d, nor by any other letter or point
in the world.

But after He had formed this Idea, the particular conception, limited
and intelligible, which the Ten Numerations are, of the medium of
transmission, Adam Kadmon, the Primal or Supreme Man, He by that medium
descended, and may, through that Idea, be called by the name IHUH, and
so created things have cognizance of Him, by means of His proper
likeness.

Woe unto him who makes God to be like unto any mode or attribute
whatever, even were it to one of His own; and still more if he make Him
like unto the Sons of Men, whose elements are earthly, and so are
consumed and perish!

There can be no conception had of Him, except in so far as He manifests
Himself, in exercising dominion by and through some attribute . . .
Abstracted from this, there can be no attribute, conception, or ideal of
Him. He is comparable only to the Sea, filling some great reservoir, its
bed in the earth, for example; wherein it fashions for itself a certain
concavity, so that thereby we may begin to compute the dimensions of the
Sea itself.

For example, the Spring and Source of the Ocean is a somewhat, which is
*one*. If from this Source or Spring there issues forth a certain
fountain, proportioned to the space occupied by the Sea in that
hemispherical reservoir, such as is the letter Yo\_d, there the Source
of Spring is the first somewhat, and the fountain that flows forth from
it is the second. Then let there be made a great reservoir, as by
excavation, and let this be called the Ocean, and we have the third
thing, a vessel \[*Vas*\]. Now let this great reservoir be divided into
seven beds of rivers, that is, into seven oblong reservoirs, so that
from this ocean the waters may flow forth in- seven rivers; and the
Source, Fountain, and Ocean thus make *ten* in all.

The Cause of Causes made ten Numerations, and called the Source of
Spring KETHER, *Corona*, the Crown, in which the idea

<span id="page_753">p. 753</span>

of circularity is involved, for there is no end to the out-flow of
Light; and therefore He called this, like Himself, *endless*; for this
also, like Him, has no similitude or configuration, nor hath it any
vessel or receptacle wherein it may be contained, or by means whereof
any possible cognizance can be had of it.

After thus forming the Crown, He constituted a certain smaller
receptacle, the letter Yo\_d, and filled it from that source; and this
is called "The Fountain gushing with Wisdom," and, manifested in this,
He called Himself WISE, and the vessel He called HAKEMAH, *Wisdom*,
*Sapientia*.

Then He also constituted a great reservoir, which He called the Ocean;
and to it He gave the name of BINAH, Understanding, *Intelligentia*. In
this He characterized Himself as Intelligent or *Conceiver*. HE is
indeed the Absolutely Wise and Intelligent, but Hakemah is not Absolute
Wisdom of itself, *but is wise by means of Binah*, who fills Himself
from it, and if this supply were taken from it, would be dry and
unintelligent.

And thereupon seven precious vessels become, to which are given the
following names: GEDULAH, *Magnificence* or *Benignity* \[or KHASED,
*Mercy*\]; GEBURAH, *Austerity*, *Rigor* or *Severity*; TEPHARETH,
*Beauty*; NETSAKH, *Victory*; HO\_D, *Glory*; YESOD, *Foundation* or
*Basis*; and MALAKOTH, *Rule*, *Reign*, *Royalty*, *Dominion* or
*Power*. And in GEDULAH He took the character of *Great* and
*Benignant*; in GEBURAH, of *Severe*; in TEPHARETH, of *Beautiful*; in
NETSAKH, of *Overcoming*; in HO\_D, of OUR GLORIOUS AUTHOR; in YESOD, of
*Just*, by Yesod all vessels and worlds being upheld; and in MALAKOTH He
applied to Himself the title of *King*.

These numerations or Sephiroths are held in the Kabala to have been
originally contained in each other; that is, Kether contained the nine
others, Hakemah contained Binah, and Binah contained the last seven.

For all things, says the commentary of Rabbi *Jizchak Lorja*, in a
certain most abstruse manner, consist or reside and are contained in
Binah, and it projects them, and sends them downward, species by
species, into the several worlds of Emanation, Creation, Formation, and
Fabrication; all whereof are derived from what are above them, and are
termed their out-flowings; for, from the potency which was their state
there, they descend into actuality.

<span id="page_754">p. 754</span>

The INTRODUCTION says:

It is said in many places in the Sohar, that all things that emanate or
are created have their root above. Hence also the Ten Sephiroth have
their root above, in the world of the garment, with the very Substance
of HIM. And AINSOPH had full consciousness and appreciation, prior to
their actual existence, of all the Grades and Impersonations contained
unmanifested within Himself, with regard to the essence of each, and its
domination then in potency . . . When He came to the Sephirah of the
Impersonation Malakoth, which He then contained hidden within Himself,
He concluded within Himself that therein worlds should be framed; since
the scale of the first nine Sephiroths was so constituted, that it was
neither fit nor necessary for worlds to be framed from *them*; for all
the attributes of these nine Superior Sephiroth could be assigned to
Himself, even if He should never operate outwardly; but Malakoth, which
is Empire or Dominion, could not be attributed to Him, unless He ruled
over other Existences; whence from the point Malakoth He produced all
the worlds into actuality.

These circles are ten in number. Originated by points, they expanded in
circular shape. Ten Circles, under the mystery of the ten Sephiroth, and
between them ten Spaces; whence it appears that the sphere of Splendor
is in the centre of the space Malakoth of the First Occult Adam.

The First Adam, *in the ten circles above the Splendor*, is called the
First *occult* Adam; and in each of these spaces are formed many
thousand worlds. The first Adam is *involved* in the Primal Ether, and
is the analogue of the world Binah.

Again the Introduction repeats the first and second descent of Yo\_d
into the vacated space, to make the light there less great and subtile;
the constitution of the *Tehiru*, Splendor, from the light left behind
there by him; the communication of Light to him by the female letter He;
the emission by him of that Light, within the sphere of Splendor, and
the formation thereof, within the sphere, "of a certain sphere called
the Supreme Crown," *Corona Summa*, KETHER, "wherein were contained, in
potence, all the remaining Numerations, so that they were not
distinguishable from it. Precisely as in man exist the four elements, in
potence specifically undistinguishable, so in this Corona were in
potence all the ten Numerations, specifically undistinguishable." This
Crown, it is

<span id="page_755">p. 755</span>

added, was called, after the restoration, The Cause of Causes, and the
Ancient of the Ancients.

The point, Kether, adds the Introduction, was the aggregate of all the
Ten . . . when it first emanated, it consisted of all the Ten; and the
Light which extended from the Emanative Principle simultaneously flowed
into *it*; and beheld the two *Universals* \[that is, the Unities out of
which manifoldness flows; as, for example, the *idea*, within the Deity,
of Humanity as a Unit, out of which the individuals were to flow\], the
Vessel or Receptacle containing this immitted Light, and the Light
Itself within it. And *this Light is the Substance of the point Kether;
for the WILL of God is the Soul of all things that are*.

The Ainsophic Light, it had said, was infinite in every direction, and
without end or limit. To prevent it from flowing into and re-filling the
quasi-vacant space, occupied by an infinitely less Splendor, a partition
between the greater and lesser Splendor was necessary; and this
partition, the boundary of the sphere of Splendor, and a like one
bounding the sphere Kether, were called *Vessels* or *Receptacles*,
*containing*, including, and enclosing within themselves the light of
the sphere. Imagine a sea of pellucid water, and in the centre of it a
spherical mass of denser and darker water. The outer surface of this
sphere, or its limits every way, is the vessel containing it. The
Kabalah regards the vessels "as by their nature somewhat opaque, and not
so splendid as the light they enclose."

The contained Light is the *Soul* of the vessels, and is active in them,
like the Human Soul in the human body. The Light of the Emanative
Principle \[Ainsoph\] *inheres* in the vessels, as their *Life*,
internal *Light*, and *Soul*. . . Kether emanated, with its Very
Substance, at the same time as Substance and Vessel, in like manner as
the flame is annexed to the live coal, and as the Soul pervades, and is
within, the body. All the Numerations were potentially contained in it.

And this potentiality is thus explained: When a woman conceives, a Soul
is immediately sent into the embryo which is to become the infant, in
which Soul are then, potentially, all the members and veins of the body,
which afterward, from that potency of the Soul, *become* in the human
body of the child to be born.

Then the wisdom of God commanded that these Numerations

<span id="page_756">p. 756</span>

potentially in Kether, should be produced from potentiality into
actuality, in order that worlds might consist; and HE directed Yo\_d
again to descend, and to enter into and shine within Kether, and then to
re-ascend: which was so done. From which illumination and re-ascension,
all the other numerations, potentially in Kether, were manifested and
disclosed; but they continued still compacted together, remaining within
Kether in a circle.

When God willed to produce the other emanations or numerations from
Kether, it is added, HE sent Yo\_d down again, to the upper part of
Kether, one-half of him to remain without and one-half to penetrate
within the sphere of Kether. Then HE sent the letter Vav into the
Splendor, to pour out its light on Yo\_d: and thus,--

Yo\_d received light from Vav, and thereby so directed his countenance
that it should illuminate and confer exceeding great energy on Hakemah,
which yet remained in Kether; so giving it the faculty to proceed forth
therefrom; and that it might collect and contain within itself, and
there reveal, all the other eight numerations, until that time in
Kether.

The sphere of Kether opened, and thereout issued Hakemah, to remain
below Kether, containing in itself all the other numerations.

By a similar process, Binah, illuminated within Hakemah by a second
Yo\_d, "issued forth out of Hakemah, having within itself the Seven
lower Numerations."

And since the vessel of Binah was excellent, and coruscated with rays of
the color of sapphire, and was so nearly of the same color as the vessel
of Hakemah that there was scarcely any difference between them, hence it
would not quietly remain below Hakemah, but rose, and placed itself on
his left side.

And because the light from above profusely flowed into and accumulated
in the vessel of Hakemah, to so great an extent that it overflowed, and
escaped, coruscating, outside of that vessel, and, flowing off to the
left, communicated potency and increase to the vessel of Binah . . . .
For Binah is *female* . . . .

Binah, therefore, by means of this energy that flowed into it from the
left side of Hakemah, by virtue of the second Yo\_d, came to possess
such virtue and potency, as to project beyond itself the Seven remaining
vessels contained within itself, and so emitted them all, continuously,
one after the other . . . all connected and linked one with the other,
like the links of a chain.

<span id="page_757">p. 757</span>

Three points first emanated, one under the other; Kether, Hakemah, and
Binah; and, so far, there was no copulation. But afterward the positions
of Hakemah and Binah changed, so that they were side by side, Kether
remaining above them; and then conjunction of the Male and Female, ABA
and IMMA, *Father* and *Mother*, as points.

He, from Whom all emanated, created Adam Kadmon, consisting of all the
worlds, so that in him should be somewhat from those above, and somewhat
from those below. Hence in Him was NEPHESCH \[PSYCHE, *anima infima*,
the lowest spiritual part of man, Soul\], from the world ASIAH, which is
one letter *He* of the Tetragrammaton; RUACH \[ SPIRITUS, *anima media*,
the next higher spiritual part, or *Spirit*\], from the world YEZIRAH,
which is the *Vav* of the Tetragrammaton; NESCHAMAH \[the highest
spiritual part, *mens* or *anima superior*\], from the world BRIAH,
which is the other letter *He*; and NESCHAMAH LENESCHAMAH, from the
world ATSILUTH, which is the YO\_D of the Tetragrammaton.

And these letters \[the Sephiroth\] were changed from the spherical form
into the form of a person, the symbol of which person is the BALANCE, it
being *Male* and *Female* . . . Hakemah on one side, Binah on the other,
and Kether over them: and so Gedulah on one side, Geburah on the other,
and Tephareth under them.

The Book *Omschim* says: Some hold that the ten Sephiroth succeeded one
another in ten degrees, one above the other, in regular gradation, one
connected with the other in a direct line, from the highest to the
lowest. Others hold that they issued forth in three lines, parallel with
each other, one on the right hand, one on the left, and one in the
middle; so that, beginning with the highest and going down to the
lowest, Hakemah, Khased \[or Gedulah\], and Netsach are one over the
other, in a perpendicular line, on the right hand; Binah, Geburah, and
Ho\_d on the left; and Kether, Tephareth, Yesod, and Malakoth in the
middle: and many hold that all the ten subsist in circles, one within
the other, and all homocentric.

It is also to be noted, that the Sephirothic tables contain still
another numeration, sometimes called also a Sephirah, which is called
Daath, cognition. It is in the middle, below Hakemah and Binah, and is
the result of the conjunction of these two.

To Adam Kadmon, the Idea of the Universe, the Kabalah assigns a human
form. In this, Kether is the cranium, Hakemah and

<span id="page_758">p. 758</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Binah the two
lobes of the brain, Gedulah and Geburah the two arms, Tephareth the
trunk, Netsach and Ho\_d the thighs, Yesod the male organ, and Malkuth
the female organ, of generation.

Yo\_d is Hakemah, and He Dinah; Vav is Tephareth, and the last He,
Malkuth.

The whole, say the *Books Mysterii* or of *Occultation*, is thus summed
up: The intention of God The Blessed was to form Impersonations, in
order to diminish the Light. Wherefore HE constituted, in Macroprosopos,
Adam Kadmon, or Arik Anpin, three Heads. The first is called, "The Head
whereof is no cognition"; the second, "The Head of that which is
non-existent"; and the third, "The Very Head of Macroprosopos"; and
these three are *Corona*, *Sapientia*, and *Informatio*, Kether,
Hakemah, and Binah, existent in the Corona of the World of Emanation, or
in Macroprosopos; and these three are called in the Sohar ATIKA
KADISCHA, *Senex Sanctissimus*, The Most Holy Ancient. But the Seven
inferior Royalties of the first Adam are called "The Ancient of Days";
and this Ancient of Days is the internal part, or Soul, of
Macroprosopos.

The human mind has never struggled harder to understand and explain to
itself the process of creation, and of Divine manifestation, *and at the
same time to conceal its thoughts from all but the initiated*, than in
the Kabalah. Hence, much of it seems at first like jargon. Macroprosopos
or Adam Kadmon is, we have said, the idea or intellectual aggregate of
the whole Universe, included and contained unevolved in the manifested
Deity, Himself yet contained unmanifested in the Absolute. The Head,
Kether, "whereof is no cognition," is the *Will* of the Deity, or the
Deity *as* Will. Hakemah, the head "of that which is non-existent," is
the Generative Power of begetting or producing Thought; yet *in* the
Deity, not in action, and therefore non-existent. Binah, "the very or
actual head" of Macroprosopos, is the productive intellectual capacity,
which, impregnated by Hakemah, is to *produce* the Thought. This Thought
is Daath; or rather, the result is Intellection, Thinking; the Unity, of
which Thoughts are the manifold outflowings.

This may be illustrated by a comparison. Pain, in the human being, is a
feeling or sensation. It must be *produced*. To produce it, there must
be, not only the *capacity* to *produce* it, in the nerves, but also the
*power* of *generating* it by means of that capacity.

<span id="page_759">p. 759</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> This generative
Power, the Passive Capacity which produces, and the pain produced, are
like Hakemah, Dinah, and Daath.

The four Worlds or Universals, Aziluth, Briah, Yetzirah, and Asiah, of
Emanation, Creation, Formation, and Fabrication, are another enigma of
the Kabalah. The first three are wholly *within* the Deity. The first is
the Universe, as it exists potentially in the Deity, determined and
imagined, but as yet wholly formless and undeveloped, except so far as
it is contained in His Emanations. The second is the Universe in idea,
distinct within the Deity, but not invested with forms; a simple unity.
The third is the same Universe in potence in the Deity, unmanifested,
but invested with forms,--the idea developed into manifoldness and
individuality, and succession of species and individuals; and the fourth
is the potentiality become the Actuality, the Universe fabricated, and
existing as it exists for us.

The Sephiroth, says the *Porta Cælorum*, by the virtue of their Infinite
Emanator, who uses them as a workman uses his tools, and who operates
with and through them, are the cause of existence of everything created,
formed, and fashioned, employing in their production certain *media*.
But these same *Sephiroth*, *Persons* and *Lights*, are not creatures
*per se*, but *ideas*, and *Rays* of THE INFINITE, which, by different
gradations, so descended from the Supreme Source as still not to be
severed from It; but It, through them, is extended to the production and
government of all Entities, and is the Single and Perfect Universal
Cause of All, though becoming determinate for this or the other
operation, through this or that Sephiroth or MODE.

God produced all things by His Intellect and Will and free
Determination. He willed to produce them by the mediation of His
Sephiroth, and Persons . . . . . by which He is enabled most perfectly
to manifest Himself; and that the *more* perfectly, by producing the
causes themselves, and the Causes of Causes, and not merely the viler
effects.

God produced, in the first Originate, all the remaining causates. For,
as He Himself is most simply One, and from One Simple Being One only can
*im*mediately proceed, hence it results that from the First Supreme
Infinite Unity flowed forth at the same time All and One. One, that is,
in so far as flowing from the Most Simple Unity, and being like unto It;
but also All, in so far as, departing from that perfect Singleness which
can be measured

<span id="page_760">p. 760</span>

by no other Singleness, it became, to a certain extent, manifold, though
still Absolute and Perfect.

Emanation, says the same, is the Resulting displayed from the
Unresulting, the Finite from the Infinite, the Manifold and Composite
from the Perfect Single and Simple, Potentiality from that which is
Infinite Power *and* Act, the mobile from that which is perennially
permanent; and therefore in a more imperfect and diminished mode than
His Infinite Perfection is. As the First Cause is all things, in an
unresulting and Infinite mode, so the Entities that flow from Him are
the First Causes, in a resulting and finite mode.

THE NECESSARY ENTITY, subsisting of Itself, as It cannot be dissevered
into the manifold, yet becomes, as it were, multiplied in the Causates,
in respect of their Nature, or of the Subsistences, Vessels, and
openings assigned to them; whereby the Single and Infinite Essence,
being inclosed or comprehended in these limits, bounds, or
externalnesses, takes on Itself Definiteness of dimension, and becomes
Itself manifold, by the manifoldness of these envelopes.

As man \[the unit of Humanity\] is a microcosm, so Adam Kadmon is a
macrocosm, containing all the Causates of the First Cause . . . . . as
the Material Man is the end and completion of all creation, so in the
Divine Man is the beginning thereof. As the inferior Adam *receives* all
things *from* all, so the superior Adam *supplies* all things *to* all.
As the former is the principle of *reflected* light, so the latter is of
*Direct* Light. The former is the terminus of the Light, descending; the
latter its terminus, ascending. As the Inferior man ascends from the
lowest matter even to the First Cause, so the Superior Adam descends
from the Simple and Infinite Act, even to the lowest and most attenuated
Potence.

The Ternary is the bringing back of duality to unity.

The Ternary is the Principle of Number, because, bringing back the
binary to unity, it restores to it the same quantity whereby it had
departed from unity. It is the first odd number, containing in itself
the first even number and the unit, which are the Father and Mother of
all Numbers; and it has in itself the beginning, middle, and end.

Now, Adam Kadmon emanated from the Absolute Unity, and so is himself a
unit; but he also descends and flows downward into

<span id="page_761">p. 761</span>

his own Nature, and so is duality. Again, he returns to the Unity, which
he hath in himself, and to The Highest, and so is the Ternary and
Quaternary.

And this is why the Essential Name has four letters,--three different
ones, and one of them once repeated; since the first He is the wife of
the Yo\_d, and the second He is the wife of the Vav.

Those *media* which manifest the First Cause, in Himself profoundly
hidden, are the Sephiroth, which emanate immediately from that First
Cause, and by Its Nature have produced and do control all the rest.

These Sephiroth were put forth from the One First and Simple,
manifesting His Infinite Goodness. They are the mirrors of His Truth,
and the analogues of His Supremest Essence, the Ideas of His Wisdom, and
the representations of His will; the receptacles of His Potency, and the
instruments with which He operates; the Treasury of His Felicity, the
dispensers of His Benignity, the Judges of His Kingdom, and reveal His
Law; and finally, the Denominations, Attributes, and Names of Him Who is
above all and the Cause of all . . . . . the ten categories, wherein all
things are contained; the universal genera, which in themselves include
all things, and utter them outwardly . . . . the Second Causes, whereby
the First Cause effects, preserves, and governs all things; the rays of
the Divinity, whereby all things are illumined and manifested; the Forms
and Ideas and Species, out whereof all things issue forth; the Souls and
Potencies, whereby essence, life, and movement are given to all things;
the Standard of times, whereby all things are measured; the incorporeal
Spaces which, in themselves, hold and inclose the Universe; the Supernal
Monads to which all manifolds are referred, and through them to The One
and Simple; and finally the Formal Perfections, flowing forth from and
still connected with the One Eminent Limitless Perfection, are the
Causes of all dependent Perfections, and so illuminate the elementary
Intelligences, not adjoined to matter, and the intellectual Souls, and
the Celestial, Elemental and Element-produced bodies.

The IDRA SUTA says:

HE, the Most Holy Hidden Eldest, separates Himself, and is ever more and
more separated from all that are; nor yet does HE in very deed separate
Himself; because all things cohere with

<span id="page_762">p. 762</span>

Him and HE with All. HE is All that is, the Most Holy Eldest of All, the
Occult by all possible occultations.

When HE takes shape, HE produces nine Lights, which shine forth from
Him, from His outforming. And those Lights out-shine from Him and emit
flames, and go forth and spread out on every side; as from one elevated
Lamp the Rays are poured forth in every direction, and these Rays thus
diverging, are found to be, when one approaching has cognizance of them,
but a single Lamp.

The Space in which to create is fixed by THE MOST HOLY ANCIENT, and
illuminated by His inflowing, which is the Light of Wisdom, and the
Beginning from which manifestation flows.

And HE is conformed in three Heads, which are but one Head; and these
three are extended into Microprosopos, and from them shines out all that
is.

Then this Wisdom instituted investiture with form, whereby the
unmanifested and informous became manifested, putting on form; and
produced a certain outflow.

When this Wisdom is thus expanded by flowing forth, then it is called
"Father of Fathers," the whole Universe of Things being contained and
comprehended in it. This Wisdom is the principle of all things, and in
it beginning and end are found.

The Book of the Abstruse, says the *Siphra de Zeniutha*, is that which
describes the equilibrium of the Balance. Before the Balance was, face
did not look toward face.

And the *Commentary* on it says: The Scales of the Balance are
designated as Male and Female. In the Spiritual world Evil and Good are
*in equilibrio*, and it will be restored, when of the Evil Good becomes,
until all is Good. Also this other world is called the World of the
Balance. For, as in the Balance are two scales, one on either side and
the beam and needle between them, so too in this world of restoration,
the Numerations are arranged as distinct persons. For Hakemah is on the
right hand, on the side of Gedulah, and Binah on the left, on the side
of Geburah; and Kether is the beam of the Balance above them in the
middle. So Gedulah or Khased is on one hand, and Geburah on the other,
and under these Tephareth; and Netsach is on one side, and Ho\_d on the
other, and under these Yeso\_d.

The Supreme Crown, which is the Ancient Most Holy, the most Hidden of
the Hidden, is fashioned, *within* the occult Wisdom, of both sexes,
Male and Female.

<span id="page_763">p. 763</span>

Hakemah, and Binah, the Mother, whom it impregnates, are quantitatively
equal. Wisdom and the Mother of Intellection go forth at once and dwell
together; for when the Intellectual Power emanates, the productive
*Source* of intellection is included in Him.

Before Adam Kadmon was fashioned into Male and Female, and the state of
equilibrium introduced, the Father and Mother did not look each other in
the face; for the Father denotes most perfect Love, and the Mother most
perfect Rigor; and she averted her face.

There is no *left* \[female\], says the *Idra Rabba*, in the Ancient and
Hidden One; but His totality is Right \[male\]. The totality of things
is HUA, HE, and HE is hidden on every side.

Macroprosopos \[Adam Kadmon\] is not so near unto us as to speak to us
in the first person; but is designated in the third person, HUA, HE.

Of the letters it says:

Yo\_d is male, He is female, Vav is both.

In Yo\_d \[‏ו ?Y‎\] are three Yo\_ds, the upper and the lower apex, and
Vav in the middle. By the upper apex is denoted the Supreme Kether; by
Vav in the middle, Hakemah; and by the lower apex, Binah.

The IDRA SUTA says:

The Universe was out-formed in the form of Male and Female. Wisdom,
pregnant with all that is, when it flowed and shone forth, shone
altogether under the form of male and female. Hakemah is the Father, and
Binah is the Mother; and so the two are in equilibrium as male and
female, and for this reason, all things whatsoever are constituted in
the form of male and female; *and if it were not so they would not
exist*.

This Principle, Hakemah, is the Generator of all things; and He and
Binah conjoin, and she shines within Him. When they thus conjoin, she
conceives, and the out-flow is Truth.

Yo\_d impregnates the letter He and begets a son; and she, thus
pregnant, brings forth. The Principle called Father \[the Male or
Generative Principle\] is comprehended in Yo\_d, which itself flows
downward from the energy of the Absolute Holy One.

Yo\_d is the beginning and the end of all things that are. The stream
that flows forth is the Universe of things, which always *becomes*,
having no cessation. And this *becoming* world is created by Yo\_d: for
Yo\_d includes two letters. All things are included in Yo\_d; wherefore
it is called the Father of all.

<span id="page_764">p. 764</span>

All Categories whatever go forth from Hakemah; and in it are contained
all things, unmanifested; and the aggregate of all things, or the Unity
*in* which the many *are*, and *out* of which all flow, is the Sacred
Name IHUH.

In the view of the Kabalists, all individuals are *contained* in
species, and all species in genera, and all particulars in a Universal,
which is an idea, abstracted from all consideration of individuals; not
an *aggregate* of individuals; but, as it were, an *Ens*, Entity or
Being, ideal or intellectual, but none the less real; prior to *any*
individual, *containing* them all, and out of which they are all in
succession evolved.

If this discontents you, reflect that, supposing the theory correct,
that *all* was originally in the Deity, and that the Universe has
proceeded forth from Him, and not been *created* by Him out of nothing,
the *idea* of the Universe, existing in the Deity before its out-flow,
must have been as real as the Deity Himself. The whole Human race, or
Humanity, for example, then existed in the Deity, not distinguished into
individuals, but as a Unit, out of which the Manifold was to flow.

Everything *actual* must also first have been *possible*, before having
actual existence; and this possibility or potentiality was to the
Kabalists a real Ens. Before the evolvement of the Universe, it had to
exist *potentially*, the whole of it, with all its individuals, included
in a single Unity. This was the Idea or Plan of the Universe; and this
had to be *formed*. It had to emanate from the Infinite Deity, and be
*of* Himself, though not His Very Self.

Geburah, Severity, the Sephirah opposite to and conjoined sexually with
Gedulah, to produce Tephareth, Harmony and Beauty, is also called in the
Kabalah "*Judgment*," in which term are included the ideas of
*limitation* and *conditioning*, which often seems, indeed, to be its
principal sense; while Benignity is as often styled *Infinite*. Thus it
is obscurely taught that in everything that is, not only the *Finite*
but also the *Infinite* is present; and that the rigor of the stern law
of limitation, by which everything below or beside the Infinite Absolute
is limited, bounded, and conditioned, is tempered and modified by the
*grace*, which so relaxes it that the Infinite, Unlimited,
Unconditioned, is also everywhere present; and that it is thus the
Spiritual and Material Natures are *in equilibrio*, Good everywhere
counterbalancing Evil, Light everywhere in equilibrium with Darkness:
from which again results

<span id="page_765">p. 765</span>

the Universal Harmony of things. In the vacant space effected for
creation, there at last remained a faint vestige or trace of Ainsophic
Light, of the Light of the Substance of the Infinite. Man is thus both
human and divine: and the *apparent* antagonisms in his Nature are a
real equilibrium, *if he wills it shall be so*; from which results the
Harmony, not only of Life and Action, but of Virtue and Perfection.

To understand the Kabalistic idea of the Sephiroth, it must be borne in
mind that they were assigned, not only to the world of Emanation,
Aziluth, but also to each of the other worlds, Briah, Jezirah, and
Asiah. They were not only attributes of the Unmanifested Deity, not only
Himself in limitation, but His actual manifestations, or His qualities
made apparent as modes; and they were also qualities of the Universal
Nature--Spiritual, Mental, and Material, produced and made existent by
the outflow of Himself.

In the view of the Kabalah, God and the Universe were One, and in the
One General, as the type or source, were included and involved, and from
it have been evolved and issued forth, the manifold and all particulars.
Where, indeed, does individuality begin? Is it the Hidden Source and
Spring alone that is the individual, the Unit, or is it the flowing
fountain that fills the ocean, or the ocean itself, or its waves, or the
drops, or the vaporous particles, that are the individuals? The Sea and
the River--these are each One; but the drops of each are many. The tree
is one; but its leaves are a multitude: they drop with the frosts, and
fall upon his roots; but the tree still continues to grow, and new
leaves come again in the Spring. Is the Human Race not the Tree, and are
not individual men the leaves? How else explain the force of will and
sympathy, and the dependence of one man at every instant of his life on
others, except by the oneness of the race? The links that bind all
created things together are the links of a single Unity, and the whole
Universe is One, developing itself into the manifold.

Obtuse commentators have said that the Kabalah assigns sexual
characteristics to the very Deity. There is no warrant for such an
assertion, anywhere in the Sohar or in any commentary upon it. On the
contrary, the whole doctrine of the Kabalah is based on the fundamental
proposition, that the Very Deity is Infinite, everywhere extended,
without limitation or determination, and therefore without any
conformation whatever. In order to commence

<span id="page_766">p. 766</span>

the process of creation, it was necessary for Him, first of all, to
effect a vacant space within Himself. To this end the Deity, whose
Nature is approximately expressed by describing Him as Light filling all
space, formless, limitless, contracts Himself on all sides from a point
within Himself, and thus effects a quasi-vacant space, in which only a
vestige of His Light remains; and into this circular or spherical space
He [emits](errata.htm#37.md) His Emanations, portions of His Light or
Nature; and to some of these, sexual characteristics are symbolically
assigned.

The Infinite first limits Himself by flowing forth in the shape of
*Will*, of determination to act. This *Will* of the Deity, or the Deity
as will, is *Kether*, or the *Crown*, the first Sephirah. In it are
*included* all other Emanations. This is a philosophical necessity. The
Infinite does not *first* will, and *then*, as a sequence to, or
consequence of, that determination, *subsequently* perform. To will and
to act must be, with Him, not only simultaneous, but in reality *the
same* . . Nor does He, by His Omniscience, *learn* that a particular
action will be wise, and then, in consequence of being so convinced,
first *determine* to do the act, and *then* do it. His Wisdom and His
Will, also, act simultaneously; and, with Him, to decide that it was
wise to create, *was* to create. Thus His will contains in itself all
the Sephiroth. This will, determining Him to the exercise of
intellection, to thought, to frame the Idea of the Universe, caused the
Power in Him to excite the intellectual Faculty to exercise, and *was*
that Power. Its SELF, which had flowed forth from Ainsoph as Will, now
flows forth as the Generative Power to beget intellectual action in the
Intellectual Faculty, or Intelligence, Binah. The *Act* itself, the
Thought, the Intellection, producing the Idea, is *Daath*; and as the
text of the *Siphra de Zeniutha* says, The Power and Faculty, the
Generative and Productive, the Active and Passive, the Will and
Capacity, which unite to produce that Act of reflection or Thought or
Intellection, are *always* in conjunction. As is elsewhere said in the
Kabalah, both of them are *contained* and essentially *involved* in the
result. And the Will, *as* Wisdom or Intellectual Power, and the
Capacity or Faculty, are really the Father and Mother of all that is;
for to the creation of *anything*, it was absolutely necessary that The
Infinite should form for Himself and *in* Himself, an idea of what HE
willed to produce or create: and, as there is no Time with Him, to *will
was* to *create*, to *plan* was to *will* and to

<span id="page_767">p. 767</span>

*create*; and in the Idea, the Universe in potence, the universal
succession of things was included. Thenceforward all was merely
evolution and development.

Netsach and Ho\_d, the Seventh and Eighth Sephiroth, are usually called
in the Kabalah, Victory and Glory. Netsach is the perfect *Success*,
which, with the Deity, to Whom the Future is present, *attends*, and to
His creatures is to *result*, from the plan of Equilibrium everywhere
adopted by Him. It is the reconciliation of Light and Darkness, Good and
Evil, Free-will and Necessity, God's omnipotence and Man's liberty; and
the harmonious issue and result of all, without which the Universe would
be a failure. It is the inherent Perfection of the Deity, manifested in
His Idea of the Universe, and in all the departments or worlds,
spiritual, mental, or material, of that Universe; but it is that
Perfection regarded as the successful *result*, which it both causes or
produces and *is*; the *perfection* of the plan *being* its *success*.
It is the prevailing of Wisdom over Accident; and it, in turn, both
produces and is the Glory and Laudation of the Great Infinite Contriver,
whose plan is thus Successful and Victorious.

From these two, which are one,--from the excellence and perfection of
the Divine Nature and Wisdom, considered as Success and Glory, as the
opposites of Failure and Mortification, results what the Kabalah,
styling it Yesod, Foundation or Basis, characterizes as the Generative
member of the Symbolical human figure by which the ten Sephiroth are
represented, and from this flows Malakoth, Empire, Dominion, or Rule.
Yesod is the Stability and Permanence, which would, in ordinary
language, be said to *result* from the perfection of the Idea or
Intellectual Universal, out of which all particulars are evolved; from
the *success* of that scheme, and the consequent *Glory* or
Self-Satisfaction of the Deity; but which Stability and Permanence that
Perfection, Success, and Glory really Is; since the Deity, infinitely
Wise, and to Whom the Past, Present, and Future were and always will be
one Now, and all space one HERE, had not to await the operation and
evolution of His plan, as men do the result of an experiment, in order
to see if it would succeed, and so to determine whether it should stand,
and be stable and permanent, or fall and be temporary. Its *Perfection*
was its *Success*; His *Glory*, its *permanence* and *stability*: and
the Attributes of Permanence and Stability belong,

<span id="page_768">p. 768</span>

like the others, to the Universe, material, mental, spiritual, and real,
*because* and *as* they belong to the Infinite Himself.

This Stability and Permanence causes continuance and generates
succession. It *is* Perpetuity, and continuity without solution; and by
this continuous succession, whereby out of Death comes new Life, out of
dissolution and resolution comes reconstruction, Necessity and Fatality
result as a consequence: that is to say, the absolute control and
dominion (Malakoth) of The Infinite Deity over all that He produces, and
over chance and accident; and the absolute non-existence in the
Universe, in Time and in Space, of any other powers or influences than
those which, proceeding from Him, are and cannot *not* be perfectly
submissive to His will. This *results*, humanly speaking; but in
reality, the Perfection of the plan, which is its *success*, His
*glory*, and its *stability*, is also His Absolute Autocracy, and the
utter absence of Chance, Accident, or Antagonism. And, as the Infinite
Wisdom or Absolute Reason rules in the Divine Nature itself, so also it
does in its Emanations, and in the worlds or systems of Spirit, Soul,
and Matter; in each of which there is as little Chance or Accident or
Unreasoning Fate, as in the Divine Nature unmanifested.

This is the Kabalistic theory as to each of the four worlds;--1st, of
the Divine Nature, or Divinity itself, quantitatively limited and
determined, but not manifested into Entities, which is the world of
*Emanation*, 2d, of the first Entities, that is, of Spirits and Angels,
which is the world of *Creation*; 3d, of the first *forms*, souls, or
psychical natures, which is the world of *Formation* or *Fashioning*;
and, 4th, of Matter and Bodies, which is the world of *Fabrication*, or,
as it were, of manufacture. In each of these the Deity is *present*,
*as*, *in*, and *through* the Ten Sephiroth. First of these, in each, is
Kether, the Crown, ring, or circlet, the HEAD. Next, *in* that Head, as
the two Hemispheres of the Brain, are Hakemah and Binah, and their
result and progeny, Daath. These three are found also in the Spiritual
world, and are universals in the psychical and material world, producing
the lower Sephiroth. Then follow, in perfect Equilibrium, Law and
Equity, Justice and Mercy, the Divine Infinite Nature and the Human
Finite Nature, Good and Evil, Light and Darkness, Benignity and
Severity, the Male and the Female again, as Hakemah and Binah are,
mutually tempering each other, and by their intimate union producing the
other Sephiroth.

<span id="page_769">p. 769</span>

The whole Universe, and all the succession of entities and events were
present to The Infinite, before any act of creation; and His Benignity
and Leniency, tempering and qualifying the law of rigorous Justice and
inflexible Retribution, enabled Him to create: because, but for it, and
if He could not but have administered the strict and stern law of
justice, that would have compelled Him to destroy, immediately after its
inception, the Universe He purposed to create, and so would have
*prevented* its creation. This Leniency, therefore, was, as it were, the
very essence and quintessence of the Permanence and Stability of the
plan of Creation, and part of the Very Nature of the Deity. The Kabalah,
therefore, designates it as *Light* and *Whiteness*, by which the Very
Substance of Deity is symbolized. With this agree Paul's ideas as to Law
and Grace; for Paul had studied the Kabalah at the feet of Gamaliel the
Rabbi.

With this Benignity, the Autocracy of the dominion and control of the
Deity is imbued and interpenetrated. The former, *poured*, as it were,
into the latter, is an integral and essential *part* of it, and causes
it to give birth to the succession and continuance of the Universe. For
Malakoth, in the Kabalah, is *female*, and the matrix or womb out of
which all creation is born.

☞ *The Sephiroth may be arranged as on page [770](#page_770.md)*.

The Kabalah is the primitive tradition, and its entirety rests on the
single dogma of Magism, "the visible is for us the proportional measure
of the invisible." The Ancients, observing that equilibrium is in
physics the universal law, and that it results from the apparent
opposition of two forces, concluded from the physical to the
metaphysical equilibrium, and thought that in God, that is to say, in
the first living and active cause, two properties necessary to each
other, should be recognized; stability and movement, necessity and
liberty, order dictated by reason and the self-rule of Supreme Will,
Justice, and Love, and consequently Severity and Grace, Mercy or
Benignity.

The idea of equilibrium among all the impersonations; of the male on one
side, and the female on the other, with the Supreme Will, which *is*
also the Absolute Reason, above each two, holding the balance, is,
according to the Kabalah, the foundation of all religions and all
sciences, the primary and immutable idea of things. The Sephiroth are a
triple triangle and a circle, the idea of the Ternary explained by the
balance and multiplied by itself in the

<span id="page_771">p. 771</span>

domain of the Ideal; then the realization of this Idea in forms.

Unity can only be manifested by the Binary. Unity itself and the idea of
Unity are already two.

The human unity is made complete by the right and left. The primitive
man was of both sexes.

The Divinity, one in its essence, has two essential conditions as
fundamental bases of its existence--Necessity and Liberty.

The laws of the Supreme Reason necessitate and regulate liberty in God,
Who is necessarily reasonable and wise.

Knowledge supposes the binary. An object known is indispensable to the
being that knows.

The binary is the generator of Society and the law. It is also the
number of the *gnosis*, a word adopted in lieu of *Science*, and
expressing only the idea of cognizance by intuition. It is Unity,
multiplying itself by itself to create; and therefore it is that the
Sacred Symbols make Eve issue from the very chest of Adam.

Adam is the human Tetragram, which is summed up in the mysterious Yo\_d
of the Kabalah, image of the Kabalistic Phallus. Add to this Yo\_d \[‏ו
?Y‎\] the ternary name of Eve, and you form the name of Jehova, the
*Divine* Tetragram, the transcendent Kabalistic and magical word:

‏ו ?Y?H?W?H‎

Thus it is that Unity, complete in the fecundity of the Ternary, forms,
with it, the Quaternary, which is the key of all numbers, movements, and
forms.

The Square, turning upon itself, produces the circle equal to itself,
and the circular movement of four equal angles turning around one point,
is the quadrature of the circle.

The Binary serves as a measure for Unity; and the relation of equality
between the Above and the Below, forms with them the Ternary.

To us, Creation is Mechanism: to the Ancients it was Generation. The
world-producing egg figures in all cosmogonies; and modern science has
discovered that all animal production is oviparous. From this idea of
generation came the reverence everywhere paid the image of generative
power, which formed the Stauros of the Gnostics, and the philosophical
Cross of the Masons.

*Aleph* is the man; *Beth* is the woman. One is the Principle;

<span id="page_772">p. 772</span>

*two* is the Word. A∴ is the Active; B∴ is the Passive. Unity is Boaz,
and the Binary is Jachin.

The two columns, Boaz and Jachin, explain in the Kabalah all the
mysteries of natural, political, and religious antagonism.

Woman is man's creation; and universal creation is the female of the
First Principle. When the Principle of Existence made Himself Creator,
He produced by emanation an ideal Yo\_d; and to make room for it in the
plenitude of the uncreated Light, He had to hollow out a pit of shadow,
equal to the dimension determined by His creative desire; and attributed
by Him to the ideal Yo\_d of radiating Light.

The nature of the Active Principle is to diffuse: of the Passive
Principle, to collect and make fruitful.

Creation is the habitation of the Creator-Word. To create, the
Generative Power and Productive Capacity must unite, the Binary become
Unity again by the conjunction. The WORD is the First-BEGOTTEN, not the
first *created* Son of God.

SANCTA SANCTIS, we repeat again; the Holy things to the Holy, and to him
who is so, the mysteries of the Kabalah will be holy. Seek and ye shall
find, say the Scriptures: knock and it shall be opened unto you. If you
desire to find and to gain admission to the Sanctuary, we have said
enough to show you the way. If you do not, it is useless for us to say
more, as it has been useless to say so much.

The Hermetic philosophers also drew their doctrines from the Kabalah;
and more particularly from the Treatise *Beth Alohim* or *Domus Dei*,
known as the *Pneumatica Kabalistica*, of Rabbi Abraham Cohen Irira, and
the Treatise *De Revolutionibus Animarum* of Rabbi Jitz-chak Lorja.

This philosophy was concealed by the Alchemists under their Symbols, and
in the jargon of a rude Chemistry,--a jargon incomprehensible and absurd
except to the Initiates; but the key to which is within your reach; and
the philosophy, it may be, worth studying. The labors of the human
intellect are always interesting and instructive.

To be always rich, always young, and never to die: such has been in all
times the dream of the Alchemists.

To change into gold, lead, mercury, and all the other metals; to possess
the universal medicine and elixir of life; such is the problem

<span id="page_773">p. 773</span>

to be resolved, in order to accomplish this desire and realize this
dream.

Like all the Mysteries of Magism, the Secrets of "the Great Work" have a
threefold signification: they are religious, philosophical, and natural.

The philosophal gold, in religion, is the Absolute and Supreme Reason:
in philosophy, it is the Truth; in visible nature, the Sun; in the
subterranean and mineral world, the most perfect and pure gold.

It is for this that the pursuit of the Great Work is called the Search
for the Absolute; and the work itself, the work of the Sun.

All the masters of the Science admit that it is impossible to attain the
material results, unless there are found in the two higher Degrees all
the analogies of the universal medicine and of the philosophal stone.

Then, they say, the work is simple, easy, and inexpensive; otherwise, it
consumes fruitlessly the fortune and lives of the seekers.

The universal medicine for the Soul is the Supreme Reason and Absolute
Justice; for the mind, mathematical and practical Truth; for the body,
the Quintessence, a combination of light and gold.

The prima materia of the Great Work, in the Superior World, is
enthusiasm and activity; in the intermediate world, intelligence and
industry; in the lower world, labor: and, in Science, it is the Sulphur,
Mercury, and Salt, which by turns volatilized and fixed, compose the
AZOTH of the Sages.

The Sulphur corresponds with the elementary form of the Fire; Mercury
with the Air and Water; and Salt with the Earth.

The Great Work is, above all things, the creation of man by himself;
that is to say, the fall and entire conquest which he effects of his
faculties and his future. It is, above all, the perfect emancipation of
his will, which assures him the universal empire of Azoth, and the
domain of magnetism, that is, complete power over the universal Magical
agent.

This Magical agent, which the Ancient Hermetic philosophers disguised
under the name of "*Prima Materia*," determines the forms of the
modifiable Substance; and the Alchemists said that by means of it they
could attain the transmutation of metals and the universal medicine.

<span id="page_774">p. 774</span>

There are two Hermetic operations, one spiritual, the other material,
dependent the one on the other.

The whole Hermetic Science is contained in the dogma of Hermes, engraven
originally, it is said, on a tablet of emerald. Its sentences that
relate to operating the Great Work are as follows:

"Thou shalt separate the earth from the fire, the subtile from the
gross, gently, with much industry.

"It ascends from earth to Heaven, and again descends to earth, and
receives the force of things above and below.

"Thou shalt by this means possess the glory of the whole world, and
therefore all obscurity shall flee away from thee.

"This is the potent force of all force, for it will overcome everything
subtile, and penetrate everything solid.

"So the world was created."

All the Masters in Alchemy who have written of the Great Work, have
employed symbolic and figurative expressions; being constrained to do
so, as well to repel the profane from a work that would be dangerous for
them, as to be well understood by Adepts, in revealing to them the whole
world of analogies governed by the single and sovereign dogma of Hermes.

So, in their language, gold and silver are the King and Queen, or the
Sun and Moon; Sulphur, the flying Eagle; Mercury, the Man-woman, winged,
bearded, mounted on a cube, and crowned with flames; Matter or Salt, the
winged Dragon; the Metals in ebullition, Lions of different colors; and,
finally, the entire work has for its symbols the Pelican and the Phœnix.

The Hermetic Art is, therefore, at the same time a religion, a
philosophy, and a natural science. As a religion, it is that of the
Ancient Magi and the Initiates of all ages; as a philosophy, we may find
its principles in the school of Alexandria and the theories of
Pythagoras; as a science, we must inquire for its processes of
Paracelsus, Nicholas Flamel, and Raymond Lulle.

The Science is a real one only for those who admit and understand the
philosophy and the religion; and its process will succeed only for the
Adept who has attained the sovereignty of will, and so become the King
of the elementary world: for the grand agent of the operation of the
Sun, is that force described in the Symbol of Hermes, of the table of
emerald; it is the universal magical power; the spiritual, fiery, motive
power; it is the Od, according to the Hebrews, and the Astral light,
according to others.

<span id="page_775">p. 775</span>

Therein is the secret fire, living and philosophical, of which all the
Hermetic philosophers speak with the most mysterious re-serve: the
Universal Seed, the secret whereof they kept, and which they represented
only under the figure of the Caduceus of Hermes.

This is the grand Hermetic arcanum. What the Adepts call dead matter are
bodies as found in nature; living matters are substances assimilated and
magnetized by the science and will of the operator.

So that the Great Work is more than a chemical operation; it is a real
creation of the human word initiated into the power of the Word of God.

The creation of gold in the Great Work is effected by transmutation and
multiplication.

Raymond Lulle says, that to make gold, one must have gold and mercury;
and to make silver, silver and mercury. And he adds: "I mean by mercury,
that mineral spirit so fine and pure that it gilds even the seed of
gold, and silvers that of silver." He meant by this, either electricity,
or Od, the astral light.

The Salt and Sulphur serve in the work only to prepare the mercury, and
it is to the mercury especially that we must assimilate, and, as it
were, incorporate with it, the magnetic agent. Paracelsus, Lulle, and
Flamel alone seem to have perfectly known this mystery.

The Great Work of Hermes is, therefore, an operation essentially
magical, and the highest of all, for it supposes the Absolute in Science
and in Will. There is light in gold, gold in light, and light in all
things.

The disciples of Hermes, before promising their adepts the elixir of
long life or the powder of projection, advised them to seek for the
Philosophal *Stone*.

The Ancients adored the *Sun*, under the form of a black Stone, called
Elagabalus, or Heliogabalus. The faithful are promised, in the
Apocalypse, a white Stone.

This *Stone*, says the Masters in Alchemy, is the true *Salt* of the
philosophers, which enters as one-third into the composition of Azoth.
But Azoth is, as we know, the name of the grand Hermetic Agent, and the
true philosophical Agent: wherefore they represent their Salt under the
form of a cubical Stone.

The Philosophal Stone is the foundation of the Absolute philosophy, the
Supreme and unalterable Reason. Before thinking of

<span id="page_776">p. 776</span>

the Metallic work, we must be firmly fixed on the Absolute principles of
Wisdom; we must be in possession of this Reason, which is the touchstone
of Truth. A man who is the slave of prejudices will never become the
King of Nature and the Master of transmutations. The Philosophal Stone,
therefore, is necessary above all things. How shall it be found? Hermes
tells us, in his "Table of Emerald," we must separate the subtile from
the fixed, with great care and extreme attention. So we ought to
separate our certainties from our beliefs, and make perfectly distinct
the respective domains of science and faith; and to comprehend that we
do not know the things we believe, nor believe anything that we come to
know; and that thus the essence of the things of Faith are the unknown
and indefinite, while it is precisely the contrary with the things of
Science. Whence we shall conclude, that Science rests on reason and
experience, and Faith has for its bases sentiment and reason.

The Sun and Moon of the Alchemists concur in perfecting and giving
stability to the Philosophal Stone. They correspond to the two columns
of the Temple, Jachin and Boaz. The Sun is the hieroglyphical sign of
Truth, because it is the source of Light; and the rough Stone is the
symbol of Stability. Hence the Medieval Alchemists indicated the
Philosophal Stone as the first means of making the philosophical gold,
that is to say, of transforming all the vital powers figured by the six
metals into Sun, that is, into Truth and Light; which is the first and
indispensable operation of the Great Work, which leads to the secondary
adaptation, and enables the creators of the spiritual and living gold,
the possessors of the true philosophical Salt, Mercury, and Sulphur, to
discover, by the analogies of Nature, the natural and palpable gold.

To find the Philosophal Stone, is to have discovered the Absolute, as
all the Masters say. But the Absolute is that which admits of no errors,
is the Fixed from the Volatile, is the Law of the Imagination, is the
very necessity of Being, is the immutable Law of Reason and Truth. The
Absolute is that which IS.

To find the Absolute in the Infinite, in the Indefinite, and in the
Finite, this is the Magnum Opus, the Great Work of the Sages, which
Hermes called the Work of the Sun.

To find the immovable bases of true religious Faith, of Philosophical
Truth, and of Metallic transmutation, this is the secret of Hermes in
its entirety, the Philosophal Stone.

<span id="page_777">p. 777</span>

This stone is one and manifold; it is decomposed by Analysis, and
re-compounded by Synthesis. In Analysis, it is a powder, the powder of
projection of the Alchemists; before Analysis, and in Synthesis, it is a
stone.

The Philosophal Stone, say the Masters, must not be exposed to the
atmosphere, nor to the gaze of the Profane; but it must be kept
concealed and carefully preserved in the most secret place of the
laboratory, and the possessor must always carry on his person the key of
the place where it is kept.

He who possesses the Grand Arcanum is a genuine King, and more than a
king, for he is inaccessible to all fear and all empty hopes. In all
maladies of soul and body, a single particle from the precious stone, a
single grain of the divine powder, is more than sufficient to cure him.
"Let him hear, who hath ears to hear!" the Master said.

The Salt, Sulphur, and Mercury are but the accessorial elements and
passive instruments of the Great Work. All depends, as we have said, on
the internal Magnet of Paracelsus. The entire work consists in
*projection*: and the projection is perfectly accomplished by the
effective and realizable understanding of a single word.

There is but a single important operation in the work; this consists in
*Sublimation*, which is nothing else, according to Geber than the
elevation of dry matter, by means of fire, with adhesion to its proper
vessel.

He who desires to attain to the understanding of the Grand Word and the
possession of the Great Secret, ought carefully to read the Hermetic
philosophers, and will undoubtedly attain initiation, as others have
done; but he must take, for the key of their allegories, the single
dogma of Hermes, contained in his table of Emerald, and follow, to class
his acquisitions of knowledge and direct the operation, the order
indicated in the Kabalistic alphabet of the Tarot.

Raymond Lulle has said that, to make gold, we must first have gold.
Nothing is made out of nothing; we do not absolutely create wealth; we
increase and multiply it. Let aspirants to science well understand,
then, that neither the juggler's tricks nor miracles are to be asked of
the adept. The Hermetic science, like all the real sciences, is
mathematically demonstrable. Its results, even material, are as rigorous
as that of a correct equation.

<span id="page_778">p. 778</span>

The Hermetic Gold is not only a true dogma, a light without Shadow, a
Truth without alloy of falsehood; it is also a material gold, real,
pure, the most precious that can be found in the mines of the earth.

But the living gold, the living sulphur, or the true fire of the
philosophers, is to be sought for in the house of Mercury. This fire is
fed by the air: to express its attractive and expansive power, no better
comparison can be used than that of the lightning, which is at first
only a dry and earthly exhalation, united to the moist vapor, but which,
by self-exhalation, takes a fiery nature, acts on the humidity inherent
in it, which it attracts to itself and transmutes in its nature; after
which it precipitates itself rapidly toward the earth, whither it is
attracted by a fixed nature like unto its own.

These words, in form enigmatic, but clear at bottom, distinctly express
what the philosophers mean by their Mercury, fecundated by Sulphur, and
which becomes the Master and regenerator of the Salt. It is the AZOTH,
the universal magnetic force, the grand magical agent, the Astral light,
the light of life, fecundated by the mental force, the intellectual
energy, which they compare to sulphur, on account of its affinities with
the Divine fire.

As to the Salt, it is Absolute Matter. Whatever is matter contains salt;
and all salt \[nitre\] may be converted into pure gold by the combined
action of Sulphur and Mercury, which sometimes act so rapidly, that the
transmutation may be effected in an instant, in an hour, without fatigue
to the operator, and almost without expense. At other times, and
according to the more refractory temper of the atmospheric *media*, the
operation requires several days, several months, and sometimes even
several years.

Two primary laws exist in nature, two essential laws, which produce, by
counterbalancing each other, the universal equilibrium of things. These
are fixedness and movement, analogous, in philosophy, to Truth and
Fiction, and, in Absolute Conception, to Necessity and Liberty, which
are the very essence of Deity. The Hermetic philosophers gave the name
*fixed* to everything ponder-able, to everything that tends by its
natural to central repose and immobility; they term *volatile*
everything that more naturally and more readily obeys the law of
movement; and they form their stone by analysis, that is to say, by the
volatilization of the Fixed, and then by synthesis, that is, by fixing
the volatile, which they effect

<span id="page_779">p. 779</span>

by applying to the fixed, which they call their salt, the sulphurated
Mercury, or the light of life, directed and made omnipotent by a
Sovereign Will. Thus they master entire Nature, and their stone is found
wherever there is salt, which is the reason for saying that no substance
is foreign to the Great Work, and that even the most despicable and
apparently vile matters may be changed into gold, which is true in this
sense, that they all contain the original salt-principle, represented in
our emblems by the cubical stone.

To know how to extract from all matter the pure salt concealed in it, is
to have the Secret of the Stone. Wherefore this is a Saline stone, which
the Od or universal astral light decomposes or re-compounds: it is
single and manifold; for it may be dissolved like ordinary salt, and
incorporated with other substances. Obtained by analysis, we might term
it *the Universal Sublimate*: found by way of synthesis, it is the true
*panacea* of the ancients, for it cures all maladies of soul and body,
and has been styled, *par-excellence*, the medicine of all nature. When
one, by absolute initiation, comes to control the forces of the
universal agent, he always has this stone at his disposal, for its
extraction is then a simple and easy operation, very distinct from the
metallic projection or realization. This stone, when in a state of
sublimation, must not be exposed to contact with the atmospheric air,
which might partially dissolve it and deprive it of its virtue; nor
could its emanations be inhaled without danger. The Sage prefers to
preserve it in its natural envelopes, assured as he is of extracting it
by a single effort of his will, and a single application of the
Universal Agent to the envelopes, which the Kabalists call *cortices*,
the shells, bark, or integuments.

Hieroglyphically to express this law of prudence, they gave their
Mercury, personified in Egypt as Hermanubis, a dog's head; and to their
Sulphur, represented by the Baphomet of the Temple, that goat's head
which brought into such disrepute the occult Mediæval associations.

Let us listen for a few moments to the Alchemists themselves, and
endeavor to learn the hidden meaning of their mysterious words.

The RITUAL of the Degree of Scottish Elder MASTER, and Knight of Saint
Andrew, being the fourth Degree of Ramsay, it is said upon the
title-page, or of the Reformed or Rectified Rite of Dresden, has these
passages:

<span id="page_780">p. 780</span>

"O how great and glorious is the *presence* of the Almighty God which
gloriously shines from between the Cherubim!

"How adorable and astonishing are the *rays* of that glorious *Light*,
that sends forth its bright and brilliant beams from the Holy Ark of
Alliance and Covenant!

"Let us with the deepest veneration and devotion adore the great Source
of Life, that Glorious Spirit who is the Most Merciful and Beneficent
Ruler of the Universe and of all the creatures it contains!

"The secret knowledge of the Grand Scottish Master relates to the
combination and transmutation of different substances; where-of that you
may obtain a clear idea and proper understanding, you are to know that
all matter and all material substances are composed of combinations of
three several substances, extracted from the four elements, which three
substances in combination are, <span id="img_78000"></span>
![](img/78000.jpg), *Salt*, <span id="img_78001"></span>
![](img/78001.jpg), *Sulphur*, and <span id="img_78002"></span>
![](img/78002.jpg), *Spirit*. The first of these produces *Solidity*,
the second *Softness*, and the third the *Spiritual*, vaporous
particles. These three compound substances work potently together; and
therein consists the true process for the transmutation of metals.

"To these three substances allude the three golden basins, in the first
of which was engraved the letter M∴, in the second, the letter G∴, and
in the third nothing. The first, M∴, is the initial letter of the Hebrew
word *Malakh*, which signifies *Salt*; and the second, G∴, of the Hebrew
word *Geparaith*, which signifies *Sulphur*; and as there is no word in
Hebrew to express the vaporous and intangible *Spirit*, there is no
letter in the third basin.

"With these three principal substances you may effect the transmutation
of metals, which must be done by means of the five points or rules of
the Scottish Mastership.

"The first Master's point shows us the Brazen Sea, wherein must always
be rain-water; and out of this rain-water the Scottish Masters extract
the first substance, which is Salt; which salt must afterward undergo a
*seven-fold* manipulation and purification, before it will be properly
prepared. This seven-fold purification is symbolized by the Seven Steps
of Solomon's Temple, which symbol is furnished us by the first point or
rule of the Scottish Masters.

"After preparing the first substance, you are to extract the

<span id="page_781">p. 781</span>

second, Sulphur, out of the purest gold, to which must then be added the
purified or celestial Salt. They are to be mixed as the Art directs, and
then placed in a vessel in the form of a SHIP, in which it is to remain,
as the Ark of Noah was afloat, one hundred and fifty days, being brought
to the first damp, warm degree of fire, that it may putrefy and produce
the mineral fermentation. This is the second point or rule of the
Scottish Masters."

If you reflect, my Brother, that it was impossible for any one to
imagine that either common salt or nitre could be extracted from
rain-water, or sulphur from pure gold, you will no doubt suspect that
some secret meaning was concealed in these words.

The Kabalah considers the immaterial part of man as threefold,
consisting of NEPHESCH, RUACH, and NESCHAMAH, *Psyche*, *Spiritus*, and
*Mens*, or *Soul*, *Spirit*, and *Intellect*. There are Seven Holy
Palaces, Seven Heavens and Seven Thrones; and Souls are purified by
ascending through Seven Spheres. A *Ship*, in Hebrew, is *Ani*; and the
same word means *I*, *Me*, or *Myself*.

The RITUAL continues:

"Multiplying the substance thus obtained, is the third operation, which
is done by adding to them the animate, volatile *Spirit*; which is done
by means of the water of the Celestial Salt, as well as by the Salt,
which must daily be added to it very carefully, and strictly observing
to put neither too much nor too little; inasmuch as, if you add too
much, you will destroy that growing and multiplying substance; and if
too little, it will be self-consumed and destroyed, and shrink away, not
having sufficient substantiality for its preservation. This third point
or rule of the Scottish Masters gives us the emblem of the building of
the Tower of Babel, used by our Scottish Masters, because by
irregularity and want of due proportion and harmony that work was
stopped; and the workmen could proceed no further.

"Next comes the fourth operation, represented by the Cubical Stone,
whose faces and angles are all equal. As soon as the work is brought to
the necessary point of multiplication, it is to be submitted to the
third Degree of Fire, wherein it will receive the due proportion of the
strength and substance of the metallic particles of the Cubical Stone;
and this is the fourth point or rule of the Scottish Masters.

"Finally, we come to the fifth and last operation, indicated to us by
the Flaming Star. After the work has become a duly-proportioned

<span id="page_782">p. 782</span>

substance, it is to be subjected to the fourth and strongest Degree of
fire, wherein it must remain three times twenty-seven hours; until it is
thoroughly glowing, by which means it becomes a bright and shining
tincture, wherewith the lighter metals may be changed, by the use of one
part to a thousand of the metal. Wherefore this Flaming Star shows us
the fifth and last point of the Scottish Masters.

"You should pass practically through the five points or rules of the
Master, and by the use of one part to a thousand, trans-mute and ennoble
metals. You may then in reality say that your age is a thousand years."

In the oration of the Degree, the following hints are given as to its
true meaning:

"The three divisions of the Temple, the Outer Court, Sanctuary, and Holy
of Holies, signify the three Principles of our Holy Order, which direct
to the knowledge of morality, and teach those most practical virtues
that ought to be practised by mankind. Therefore the Seven Steps which
lead up to the Outer Court of the Temple, are the emblem of the
Seven-fold Light which we need to possess, before we can arrive at the
height of knowledge, in which consist the ultimate limits of our order.

"In the Brazen Sea we are symbolically to purify ourselves from all
pollutions, all faults and wrongful actions, as well those committed
through error of judgment and mistaken opinion, as those intentionally
done; inasmuch as they equally prevent us from arriving at the knowledge
of True Wisdom. We must thoroughly cleanse and purify our hearts to
their inmost recesses, before we can of right contemplate that *Flaming
Star*, which is the emblem of the Divine and Glorious Shekinah, or
presence of God; before we may dare approach the Throne of Supreme
Wisdom."

In the Degree of The True Mason \[*Le Vrai Maçon*\], styled in the
title-page of its Ritual the 23d Degree of Masonry, or the 12th of the
5th class, the Tracing-board displays a luminous Triangle, with a great
Yo\_d in the centre.

"The Triangle," says the Ritual, "represents one God in three Persons;
and the great Yo\_d is the initial letter of the last word.

"The Dark Circle represents the Chaos, which in the beginning God
created.

"The Cross within the Circle, the Light by means whereof He developed
the Chaos.

<span id="page_783">p. 783</span>

"The Square, the four Elements into which it was resolved.

"The Triangle, again, the three *Principles* \[Salt, Sulphur, and
Mercury\], which the intermingling of the elements produced.

"God *creates*; Nature *produces*; Art *multiplies*. God created Chaos;
Nature produced it; God, Nature, and Art, have perfected it.

"The Altar of Perfumes indicates the *Fire* that is to be applied to
Nature. The two *towers* are the two furnaces, moist and dry, in which
it is to be worked. The bowl is the mould of oak that is to inclose the
philosophal egg.

"The two figures surmounted by a Cross are the two vases, Nature and
Art, in which is to be consummated the double marriage of the white
woman with the red Servitor, from which marriage will spring a most
Potent King.

"Chaos means universal matter, formless, but susceptible of all forms.
Form is the Light inclosed in the seeds of all species; and its home is
in the Universal Spirit.

"To work on universal matter, use the internal and external fire: the
four elements result, the *Principia Principiorum* and *Inmediata*;
Fire, Air, Water, Earth. There are four qualities of these elements--the
warm and dry, the cold and moist. Two appertain to each element: The dry
and cold, to the Earth; the cold and moist, to Water; the moist and
warm, to the Air; and the warm and dry, to Fire: whereby the Fire
connects with the Earth; all the elements, as Hermes said, moving in
circles.

"From the mixture of the four Elements and of their four qualities,
result the three Principles,--Mercury, Sulphur, and Salt. These are the
philosophical, not the vulgar.

"The philosophical *Mercury* is a *Water* and SPIRIT, which dissolves
and sublimates the Sun; the philosophical *Sulphur*, a *fire* and a
SOUL, which mollifies and colors it; the philosophical *Salt*, an Earth
and a BODY, which coagulates and fixes it; and the whole is done in the
bosom of the *Air*.

"From these three-Principles result the four Elements duplicated, or the
Grand Elements, *Mercury*, *Sulphur*, *Salt*, and *Glass*; two of which
are volatile,--the Water \[Mercury\] and the Air \[Sulphur\], which is
oil; for all substances liquid in their nature avoid fire, which takes
from the one \[water\] and burns the other \[oil\]; but the other two
are dry and solid, to wit, the Salt, wherein Fire is contained, and the
pure *Earth*, which is the *Glass*; on

<span id="page_784">p. 784</span>

both of which the Fire has no other action than to melt and refine them,
unless one makes use of the liquid alkali; for, just as each element
consists of two qualities, so these great duplicated Elements partake,
each of two of the simple elements, or, more properly speaking, of all
the four, according to the greater or less degree of each,--the Mercury
partaking more of the Water, to which it is assigned; the Oil or
Sulphur, more of the Air; the Salt, of the Fire; and the Glass, of the
Earth; which is found, pure and clear, in the centre of all the
elementary composites, and is the last to disengage itself from the
others.

"The four Elements and three Principles reside in all the Compounds,
Animal, Vegetable, and Mineral; but more potently in some than in
others.

"The Fire gives them Movement; the Air, Sensation; the Water, Nutriment;
and the Earth, Subsistence.

"The four duplicated Elements engender THE STONE, if one is careful
enough to supply them with the proper quantity of fire, and to combine
them according to their natural weight. Ten parts of Air make one of
Water; ten of Water, one of Earth; and ten of Earth, one of Fire; the
whole by the Active Symbol of the one, and the Passive Symbol of the
other, whereby the conversion of the Elements is effected."

The Allusion of the Ritual, here, is obviously to the four Worlds of the
Kabalah. The ten Sephiroth of the world Briah proceed from Malakoth, the
last of the ten Emanations of the world Aziluth; the ten Sephiroth of
the world Yezirah, from Malakoth of Brian; and the ten of the world
Asiah, from Malakoth of Yezirah. The Pass-word of the Degree is given as
*Metralon*, which is a corruption of METATRON, the Cherub, who and
Sandalphon are in the Kabalah the Chief of the Angels. The Active and
Passive Symbols are the Male and Female.

The Ritual continues:

"It is thereby evident that, in the Great Work, we must employ ten parts
of philosophical Mercury to one of Sun or Moon.

"This is attained by *Solution* and *Coagulation*. These words mean that
we must dissolve the body and coagulate the spirit; which operations are
effected by the moist and dry bath.

"Of colors, *black* is the Earth; *white*, the Water; *blue*, the Air;
and *red*, the Fire; wherein also are involved very great secrets and
mysteries.

<span id="page_785">p. 785</span>

"The apparatus employed in 'The Great Work' consists of the Moist bath,
the Dry bath, the Vases of Nature and Art, the bowl of oak, *lutum
sapientiæ*, the Seal of Hermes, the tube, the physical lamp, and the
iron rod.

"The work is perfected in seventeen philosophical months, according to
the mixture of ingredients. The benefits reaped from it are of two
kinds--one affecting the soul, and the other the body. *The former
consist in knowing God, Nature, and ourself*; and those to the body are
wealth and health.

"The Initiate traverses Heaven and Earth. Heaven is the World manifest
to the Intelligence, subdivided into Paradise and Hell; Earth is the
World manifest to the Senses, also subdivided into the Celestial and
that of the Elements.

"There are Sciences specially connected with each of these. *The one is
ordinary and common; the other, mystic and secret*. The World cognizable
by the Intellect has the Hermetic Theology and the Kabalah; the
Celestial Astrology; and that of the Elements, Chemistry, which by its
decompositions and separations, effected by fire, reveals all the most
hidden secrets of Nature, in the three kinds of Compound Substances.
This last science is styled 'Hermetic,' or 'The operating of the Great
Work.'"

The Ritual of the Degree of Kabalistic and Hermetic Rose ✠, has these
passages:

"The true Philosophy, known and practised by Solomon, is the basis on
which Masonry is founded.

"Our Ancient Masons have concealed from us the most important point of
this Divine Art, under hieroglyphical characters, which are but enigmas
and parables, to all the Senseless, the Wicked, and the Ambitious.

"He will be supremely fortunate, who shall, by arduous labor, discover
this sacred place of deposite, wherein all naked the sublime Truth is
hidden; for he may be assured that he has found the True Light, the True
Felicity, the True Heavenly Good. Then may it truly be said that he is
one of the True Elect; for *it is the only real and most Sublime Science
of all those to which a mortal can aspire*: his days will be prolonged,
and his soul freed of all vices and corruption; into which" (it is
added, to mislead, as if from fear too much would be disclosed), "*the
human race is often led by indigence*."

<span id="page_786">p. 786</span>

As the symbolism of the Hall and the language of the ritual mutually
explain each other, it should be noted here, that in this Degree the
columns of the hall, 12 in number, are white variegated with black and
red. The hangings are black, and over that crimson.

Over the throne is a great Eagle, in gold, on a black ground. In the
centre of the Canopy the Blazing Star in gold, with the letter Yo\_d in
its centre. On the right and left of the throne are the Sun in gold and
the Moon in silver. The throne is ascended to by *three* Steps. The hall
and ante-room are each lighted by *ten* lights, and a single one at the
entrance. The colors, black, white, and crimson appear in the clothing;
and the Key and Balance are among the symbols.

The duty of the Second Grand Prior, says the Ritual, is "to see if the
Chapter is hermetically sealed; whether the materials are ready, and the
elements; whether the Black gives place to the White, and the White to
the Red."

"Be laborious," it says, "like the Star, and procure the light of the
Sages, and hide yourself from the Stupid Profane and the Ambitious, and
be like the Owl, which sees only by night, and hides itself from
treacherous curiosity."

"The Sun, on entering each of his houses, should be received there by
the four elements, which you must be careful to invite to accompany you,
that they may aid you in your undertaking; for without them the House
would be melancholy: wherefore you will give him to feast upon the four
elements.

"When he shall have visited his twelve houses, and seen you attentive
there to receive him, you will become one of his chiefest favorites, and
he will allow you to share all his gifts. Matter will then no longer
have power over you; you will, so to say, be no longer a dweller on the
earth; but after certain periods you will give back to it a body which
is its own, to take in its stead one altogether Spiritual. Matter is
then deemed to be dead to the world.

"Therefore it must be re-vivified, and made to be born again from its
ashes, which you will effect by virtue of the vegetation of the Tree of
Life, represented to us by the branch of acacia. Whoever shall learn to
comprehend and execute this great work, will know great things, say the
Sages of the work; but whenever you depart from the centre of the Square
and the Compass you will no longer be able to work with success.

<span id="page_787">p. 787</span>

"Another Jewel is necessary for you, and in certain undertakings cannot
be dispensed with. It is what is termed the Kabalistic pantacle . . .
This carries with it the power of commanding the spirits of the
elements. It is necessary for you to know how to use it, and that you
will learn by perseverance if you are a lover of the science of our
predecessors the Sages.

"A great Black Eagle, the King of Birds. He alone it is that can fire
the Sun, material in its nature, that has no form, and yet by its form
develops color. The black is a complete harbinger of the work: it
changes color and assumes a natural form, out whereof will emerge a
brilliant Sun.

"The birth of the Sun is always announced by its Star, represented by
the Blazing Star, which you will know by its fiery color; and it is
followed in its course by the silvery lustre of the Moon.

"A rough Ashlar is the shapeless stone which is to be prepared in order
to commence the philosophical work; and to be developed, in order to
change its form from triangular to cubic, after the separation from it
of its Salt, Sulphur, and Mercury, by the aid of the Square, Level,
Plumb, and Balance, and all the other Masonic implements *which we use
symbolically*.

"Here me put them to philosophical use, to constitute a
well-proportioned edifice, through which you are to make pass the crude
material, analogous to a candidate commencing his initiation into our
Mysteries. When we build we must observe all the rules and proportions;
for otherwise the Spirit of Life cannot lodge therein. So you will build
the great tower, in which is to burn the fire of the Sages, or, in other
words, the fire of Heaven; as also the Sea of the Sages, in which the
Sun and Moon are to bathe. That is the basin of Purification, in which
will be the water of Celestial Grace, water that doth not soil the
hands, but purifies all leprous bodies.

"Let us labor to instruct our Brother, to the end that by his toils he
may succeed in discovering the principle of life contained in the
profundity of matter, and known by the name of *Alkahest*.

"The most potent of the names of Deity is ADONAI. Its power is to put
the Universe in movement; and the Knights who shall be fortunate enough
to possess it, with weight and measure, shall have at their disposition
all the potences that inhabit it, the Elements,

<span id="page_788">p. 788</span>

and the cognizance of all the virtues and sciences that man is capable
of knowing. By its power they would succeed in discovering the primary
metal of the Sun, which holds within itself the Principle of the germ,
and wherewith we can put in alliance and six other metals, each of which
contains the principles and primitive seed of the grand philosophical
work.

"The six other metals are Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Venus, Mercury, and
Luna; vulgarly known as Lead, Tin, Iron, Copper, Quicksilver, and
Silver. Gold is not included; because it is not in its nature a metal.
It is all Spirit and incorruptible; wherefore it is the emblem of the
Sun, which presides over the Light.

"The vivifying Spirit, called Alkahest, has in itself the generative
virtue of producing the triangular Cubical Stone, and contains in itself
all the virtues to render men happy in this world and in that to come.
To arrive at the composition of that Alkahest, we begin by laboring at
the science of the union of the four Elements which are to be educed
from the three Kingdoms of Nature, Mineral, Vegetable, and Animal; the
rule, measure, weight, and equipoise whereof have each their key. We
then employ in one work the animals, vegetables, and minerals, each in
his season, which make the space of the Houses of the Sun, where they
have all the virtues required.

"Something from each of the three Kingdoms of Nature is assigned to each
Celestial House, to the end that everything may be done in accordance
with sound philosophical rules; and that everything maybe thoroughly
purified in its proper time and place in order to be presented at the
wedding-table of the Spouse and the six virgins who hold the mystic
shovel, without a common fire, but with an elementary fire, that comes
primarily by attraction, and by digestion in the philosophical bed
lighted by the four elements.

"At the banquet of the Spouses, the viands, being thoroughly, purified,
are served in Salt, Sulphur, Spirit, and Oil; a sufficient quantity
thereof is taken every month, and therewith is compounded, by means of
the Balance of Solomon, the Alkahest, to serve the Spouses, when they
are laid on the nuptial bed, there to engender their embryo, producing
for the human race immense treasures, that will last as long as the
world endures.

"Few are capable of engaging in this great work. Only the true
Free-Masons may of right aspire to it; and even of them,

<span id="page_789">p. 789</span>

very few are worthy to attain it, because most of them are ignorant of
the Clavicules and their contents, and of the Pantacle of Solomon, which
teaches how to labor at the great work.

"The weight raised by Solomon with his balance was 1, 2, 3, 4, 5; which
contains 25 times unity, 2 multiplied by 2; 3 multiplied by 3; 4
multiplied by 4; 5 multiplied by 5, and once 9; these numbers thus
involving the squares of 5 and 2, the cube of 2, the square of the
square of 2, and the square of 3."

Thus far the Ritual, in the numbers mentioned by it, is an allusion to
the 47th problem of Euclid, a symbol of Blue Masonry, entirely out of
place there, and its meaning unknown. The base of the right-angled
triangle being 3, and the perpendicular 4, the hypothenuse is 5, by the
rule that the sum of the squares of the two former equals the square of
the latter,--3×3 being 9; and 4×4, 16; and 9+16 being 25, the square of
5. The triangle contains in its sides the numbers 1, 2, and 3. The
Perpendicular is the Male; the Base, the Female; the Hypothenuse, the
product of the two.

<span id="img_78900"></span> ![](img/78900.jpg)

To fix the volatile, in the Hermetic language, means to materialize the
spirit; to volatilize the fixed is to spiritualize matter.

To separate the subtile from the gross, in the first operation,

<span id="page_790">p. 790</span>

which is wholly internal, is to free our soul from all prejudice and all
vice. This is effected by the use of the philosophical SALT, that is to
say, of WISDOM; of MERCURY, that is to say, of personal aptitude and
labor; and of SULPHUR, which represents the vital energy, and the ardor
of the will. Thus we succeed in changing into spiritual gold such things
even as are of least value, and even the foul things of the earth.

It is in this sense we are to understand the parables of the Hermetic
philosophers and the prophets of Alchemy; but in their works, as in the
Great Work, we must skillfully separate the subtile from the gross, the
mystic from the positive, allegory from theory. If you would read them
with pleasure and understandingly, you must first understand them
allegorically in their entirety and then descend from allegories to
realities by way of the correspondences or analogies indicated in the
single dogma:

"What is above is like what is below; and what is below is like what is
above."

The treatise "*Minerva Mundi*," attributed to Hermes Trismegistus,
contains, under the most poetical and profound allegories, the dogma of
the self-creation of beings, or of the law of creation that results from
the accord of two forces, these which the Alchemists called the Fixed
and the Volatile, and which are, in the Absolute, Necessity and Liberty.

When the Masters in Alchemy say that it needs but little time and
expense to accomplish the works of Science. when they affirm, above all,
that but a single vessel is necessary, when they speak of the Great and
Single furnace, which all can use, which is within the reach of all the
world, and which men possess without knowing it, they allude to the
philosophical and moral Alchemy. In fact, a strong and determined will
can, in a little while, attain complete independence; and we all possess
that chemical instrument, the great and single athanor or furnace, which
serves to separate the subtile from the gross, and the fixed from the
volatile. This instrument, complete as the world, and accurate as the
mathematics themselves, is designated by the Sages under the emblem of
the Pentagram or Star with five points, the absolute sign of human
intelligence.

The end and perfection of the Great Work is expressed, in alchemy, by a
triangle surmounted by a cross: and the letter Tau, ‏ו ?Tה‎, the last of
the Sacred alphabet, has the same meaning.

<span id="page_791">p. 791</span>

The "elementary fire," that comes primarily by attraction, is evidently
Electricity or the Electric Force, primarily developed as magnetism, and
in which is perhaps the secret of life or the vital force.

Paracelsus, the great Reformer in medicine, discovered magnetism long
before Mesmer, and pushed to its last consequences this luminous
discovery, or rather this initiation into the magic of the ancients, who
understood the grand magical agent better than we do, and did not regard
the Astral Light, Azoth, the universal magnetism of the Sages, as an
animal and particular fluid, emanating only from certain special beings.

The four Elements, the four symbolic animals, and the re-duplicated
Principles correspond with each other, and are thus arranged by the
Hermetic Masons:

<span id="img_79100"></span> ![](img/79100.jpg)

The Air and Earth represent the *Male* Principle; and the Fire and Water
belong to the *Female* Principle. To these four forms correspond the
four following philosophical ideas.

Spirit: Matter: Movement: Repose.

Alchemy reduces these four things to three:

The Absolute: the Fixed: the Volatile.

Reason: Necessity; Liberty: are the synonyms of these three words.

As all the great Mysteries of God and the Universe are thus hidden in
the Ternary, it everywhere appears in Masonry and in the Hermetic
Philosophy under its mask of Alchemy. It even

<span id="page_792">p. 792</span>

appears where Masons do not suspect it; to teach the doctrine of the
equilibrium of Contraries, and the resultant Harmony.

The double triangle of Solomon is explained by Saint John in a
remarkable manner: There are, he says, three witnesses in Heaven,--the
Father, the Word, and the Holy Spirit; and three witnesses on
earth,--the breath, water, and blood. He thus agrees with the Masters of
the Hermetic Philosophy, who give to their Sulphur the name of Ether, to
their Mercury the name of philosophical water, to their Salt that of
blood of the dragon, or menstruum of the earth. The blood, or Salt,
corresponds by opposition with the Father; the Azothic, or Mercurial
water, with the Word, or Logos; and the breath, with the Holy Spirit.
But the things of High Symbolism can be well understood only by the true
children of Science.

Alchemy has its Symbolic Triad of Salt, Sulphur, and Mercury,--man
consisting, according to the Hermetic philosophers, of Body, Soul, and
Spirit. The Dove, the Raven, and the Phœnix are striking Symbols of Good
and Evil, Light and Darkness, and the Beauty resulting from the
equilibrium of the two.

If you would understand the true secrets of Alchemy, you must study the
works of the Masters with patience and assiduity. Every word is often an
enigma; and to him who reads in haste, the whole will seem absurd. Even
when they seem to teach that the Great Work is the purification of the
Soul, and so to deal only with morals, they most conceal their meaning,
and deceive all but the Initiates.

Yo\_d \[σ or ‏ו ?Y‎\] is termed in the Kabalah the *opifex*, *workman*
of the Deity. It is, says the *Porta Cælorum*, single and primal, like
*one*, which is the first among numbers; and like a *point*, the first
before all bodies. Moved lengthwise, it produces a *line*, which is Vau,
and this moved sidewise produces a *superficies*, which is Daleth. Thus
Vau \[‏ו ?W‎\] becomes Daleth \[‏ו ?D‎\]; for movement tends from right
to left; and all communication is from above to below. The *plenitude*
of Yo\_d, that is, the *name* of this letter, spelled, is ‏ו ?Y?W?D‎,
Y-O-D. Vau \[which represents 6\] and Daleth \[4\] are 10; like Yo\_d,
their principle.

Yo\_d, says the *Siphra de Zeniutha*, is the Symbol of Wisdom and of the
Father.

The Principle called Father, says the *Idra Suta*, is comprehended in
Yo\_d, which flows downward from the Holy influence,

<span id="page_793">p. 793</span>

wherefore Yo\_d is the most occult of all the letters; for he is the
beginning and end of all things. The Supernal Wisdom is Yo\_d; and all
things are included in Yo\_d, who is therefore called Father of Fathers,
or the Generator of the Universal. The Principle of all things is called
the House of all things: wherefore Yo\_d is the beginning and end of all
things; as it is written: "*Thou halt made all things in Wisdom*." For
The All is termed Wisdom; and in it The All is contained; and the
summary of all things is the Holy Name.

Yo\_d, says the *Siphra de Zeniutha*, signifying the Father, approaches
the letter He, which is the Mother; and by the combination of these two
is denoted that luminous influence wherewith Binah is imbued by the
Supernal Wisdom.

In the name ‏ו ?Y?H?W‎, says the same, are included the Father, Mother,
and Microprosopos, their issue. He, impregnated by Vau, produced
Microprosopos, or Seir Anpin.

Wisdom, Hakemah, is the Principle of all things: it is the Father of
Fathers, and in it are the beginning and end of all things.
Microprosopos, the second Universal, is the issue of Wisdom, the Father,
and Binah, the Mother, and is composed of the six Numerations, Geburah,
Gedulah, and Tephareth, Netsach, [Ho\_d](errata.htm#38.md), and Yesod; is
represented under the form of a man, and said to have at first occupied
the place afterward filled by the world Briah \[of Creation\], but
afterward to have been raised to the Aziluthic sphere, and received
Wisdom, Intelligence, and Cognition \[Daath\] from the Supernal Wisdom
and Intellectuality.

Vau, in the tri-literal word, denotes these six members of
Microprosopos. For this latter is. formed after the fashion of
Macroprosopos, but without Kether, the will, which remains in the first
prototype or Universal; though invested with a portion of the Divine
Intellectual Power and Capacity. The first Universal does not use the
first person, and is called in the third person, ‏ו ?H?W?A‎, HUA, HE:
but the second Universal speaks in the first person, using the word ‏ו
?Aן?Y‎ ANI, I.

The IDRA RABBA, or Synodus Magna, one of the books of the Sohar, says:

The Eldest of the Eldest \[the Absolute Deity\] is in Microprosopos. All
things are one: all was, all is, all will be: there neither will be, nor
is, nor has been, mutation.

But He conformed Himself, by the formings, into a form that contains all
forms, in a form which comprehends all genera.

<span id="page_794">p. 794</span>

This form is in the likeness of His form; and is not that form but its
analogue: wherefore the human form is the form of all above and below,
which are included in it: and because it embraces all above and below.
The Most Holy so took form, and so Microprosopos was configured. All
things are equally one, in each of the two Universals; but in the second
His ways are divided, and judgment is on our side, and on the side that
looks toward us, also, they differ.

These Secrets are made known only to the reapers in the Holy Field.

The Most Holy Ancient is not called ATHAH, Thou, but Hun, He: but in
Microprosopos, where is the beginning of things, He has the name ATHAH,
and also AB, Father. From Him is the beginning, and He is called Thou,
and is the Father of Fathers. He issues from the Non-Ens; and therefore
is beyond cognition.

Wisdom is the Principle of the Universe, and from it thirty-two ways
diverge: and in them the law is contained, in twenty-two letters and ten
words. Wisdom is the Father of Fathers, and in this Wisdom is found the
Beginning and the End: wherefore there is a wisdom in each Universal,
one above, the other below.

The *Commentary of Rabbi Chajun Vital*, on the *Siphra de Zeniutha*,
says: At the beginning of emanation, Microprosopos issued from the
Father, and was intermingled with the Mother, under the mysteries of the
letter,‏ו ?H‎ \[He\], resolved in ‏ו ?D?W‎, that is, Daleth and Vau; by
which Vau is denoted Microprosopos: because Vau is six, and he is
constituted of the six parts that follow Hakemah and Binah. And,
according to this conception, the Father is called Father of Fathers,
because from Him these Fathers proceed, Benignity, Severity, and Beauty.
Microprosopos was then like the letter Vau in the letter He, because He
had no head; but when He was now born, three brains were constituted for
Him, by the flow of Divine Light from above.

And as the world of restitution \[after the vessels of the Sephiroth
below Binah had been broken, that from the fragments evil might be
created\] is instituted after the fashion of the Balance, so also is it
formed throughout in the human form. But Malakoth, Regnum, is a complete
and separate person, behind Microprosopos, and in conjunction with him,
and the two are called man.

<span id="page_795">p. 795</span>

The first world \[of Inanity\] could not continue and did not subsist,
because it had no human conformation nor the system of the Balance, the
Sephiroth being points, one below the other. The first Adam
\[Microprosopos, as distinguished from Macroprosopos, the first *Occult*
Adam\] was the beginning, wherein the ten Numerations proceeded forth
from potence into act.

Microprosopos is the second garment or interposed medium, with respect
to the Elder Most Holy, who is the name Tetragrammaton; and he is called
Alohim; because the former is Absolute Commiseration; while in
Macroprosopos his lights have the nature of Severities, with respect to
the elder Universal; though they are Commiseration, with respect to the
lights of Malakoth and the three lower worlds.

All the conformations of Macroprosopos come from the first Adam; who, to
interpose a second covering, caused a single spark to issue from the
sphere of Severity, of whose five letters is generated the name Alohim.
With this issued from the brain a most subtle air, which takes its place
on the right hand, while the spark of fire is on the left. Thus the
white and red do not intermix, that is, the Air and Fire, which are
Mercy and Judgment.

Microprosopos is the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil, his
Severities being the Evil.

REGNUM, to which is given the name of Word of The Lord, superinvests
Heaven, as the six members of the Degree Tephareth are called, and these
become and are constituted by that superior vestiture. For every
conformation and constitution is effected by means of veiling, because
occultation here is the same as manifestation, the excess of light being
veiled, so that, diminished in intensity and degree, it may be received
by those below. Those six members conceived of as contained in Binah,
are said to be in the World of Creation; as in Tephareth, in that of
Formation; and as in Malakoth, in that of Fabrication.

Before the institution of equilibrium, face was not toward face:
Microprosopos and his wife issuing forth back to back, and yet cohering.
So above; before the prior Adam was conformed into male and female, and
the state of equilibrium established, the Father and Mother were not
face to face. For the Father denotes the most perfect Love; and the
Mother the most perfect Rigor. And the seven supernal sons who proceeded
from her, from Binah, who brought forth seven, were all most perfect
rigors, having no

<span id="page_796">p. 796</span>

connection with a root in the Most Holy Ancient; that is, they were all
*dead*, destroyed, shattered; but they were placed in equilibrium, in
the equipoise of the Occult Wisdom, when it was conformed into male and
female, Rigor and Love, and they were then restored, and there was given
them a root above.

The Father is Love and Mercy, and with a pure and subtle Aur or
Benignity impregnates the Mother, who is Rigor and Severity of
Judgments; and the product is the brain of Microprosopos.

It was determined, says the *Introduction* to the Book *Sohar*, by the
Deity, to create Good and Evil in the world, according to what is said
in Isaiah, "*who makes the bight and creates the Evil*." But the Evil
was at first occult, and could not be generated and brought forth,
except by the sinning of the First Adam. Wherefore He determined that
the numerations first emanated, from Benignity downward, should be
destroyed and shattered by the excessive influx of His Light; His
intention being to create of them the worlds of Evils. But the first
three were to remain and subsist, that among the fragments should be
neither Will, Intellectual Power, nor the Capacity of Intellection of
the Divinity. The last seven numerations were *points*, like the first
three, each subsisting independently, unsustained by companionship;
which was the cause of their dying and being shattered.

There was then no Love between them, but only a two-fold Fear; Wisdom,
for example, fearing lest it should ascend again to its Source in
Kether; and also lest it should descend into Binah. Hence there was no
union between any two, except Hakemah and Binah, and this imperfect,
with averted faces. This is the meaning of the saying, that the world
was created by Judgment, which is fear. And so that world could not
subsist, and the Seven Kings were dethroned, until the attribute of
Compassion was adjoined to it, and then restoration took place. Thence
came Love and Union, and six of the parts were united into one person;
for Love is the attribute of Compassion or Mercy.

Binah produced the Seven Kings, not successively, but all together. The
Seventh is Regnum, called a stone, the corner-stone, because on it are
builded the palaces of the three lower worlds.

The first six were shattered into fragments; but Regnum was crushed into
a formless mass, lest the malignant demons created from the fragments of
the others should receive bodies from it, since from it came bodies and
vitality \[Nephesch\].

<span id="page_797">p. 797</span>

From the fragments of the vessels came all Evils; judgments, turbid
waters, impurities, the Serpent, and Adam Belial \[Baal\]. But their
internal light re-ascended to Binah, and then flowed down again into the
worlds Briah and Yezirah, there to form vestiges of the Seven
Numerations. The Sparks of the great Influence of the shattered vases
descending into the four spiritual elements, Fire, Air, Water, and
Earth, and thence into the inanimate, vegetable, living, and speaking
kingdoms, became Souls.

Selecting the suitable from the unsuitable lights, and separating the
good from the evil, the Deity first restored the universality of the
Seven Kings of the World Aziluth, and afterward the three other Worlds.

And though in them were both good and evil, still this evil did not
develop itself in act, since the Severities remained, though mitigated;
some portion of them being necessary to prevent the fragments of the
integuments from ascending. These were also left, because connection of
two is necessary to generation. And this necessity for the existence of
Severity is the mystery of the pleasure and warmth of the generative
appetite; and thence Love between husband and wife.

If the Deity, says the Introduction, had not created worlds and then
destroyed them, there could have been no evil in the world, but all
things must have been good. There would have been neither reward nor
punishment in the world. There would have been no merit in
righteousness, for the Good is known by the evil, nor would there have
been fruitfulness or multiplication in the world. If all carnal
concupiscence were enchained for three days in the mouth of the great
abyss, the egg of one of the days would be wanting to the sick man. In
time to come it will be called Laban \[‏ו ?L?Bנ‎--*white*\], because it
will be whitened of its impurity, and will return to the realm Israel,
and they will pray the Lord to give them the appetite of carnal
concupiscence, for the begetting of children.

The intention of God was, when He created the world, that His creatures
should recognize His existence. Therefore He created evils, to afflict
them withal when they should sin, and Light and Blessing to reward the
just. And therefore man necessarily has free-will and election, since
Good and Evil are in the World.

And these kings died, says the *Commentary*, because the condition of
equilibrium did not yet exist, nor was Adam Kadmon

<span id="page_798">p. 798</span>

formed male and female. They were not in contact with what was alive:
nor had any root in Adam Kadmon; nor was Wisdom which outflowed from
Him, their root, nor did they connect with it. For all these were pure
mercies and most simple Love; but those were rigorous judgments. Whence
face looked not toward face; nor the Father toward the Mother, because
from her proceeded judgments. Nor Macroprosopos toward Microprosopos.
And Regnum, the last numeration, was empty and inane. It has nothing of
itself; and, as it were, was nothing, receiving nothing from them. Its
need was, to receive Love from the Male; for it is mere rigor and
judgment; and the Love and Rigor must temper each other, to produce
creation, and its multitudes above and below. For it was made to be
inhabited; and when rigorous judgments rule in it, it is inane because
its processes cannot be carried on.

Wherefore the Balance must needs be instituted, that there might be a
root above, so that judgments might be restored and tempered, and live
and not again die. And Seven Conformations descend; and all things
become in equilibrium, and the needle of the Balance is the root above.

In the world Yezirah, says the *Pneumatica Kabalistica*, ‏ו ?Y‎ de-notes
Kether; ‏ו ?Y?H‎, Hakemah and Binah; and ‏ו ?Y?H?W‎, Gedulah, Geburah,
and Tephareth; and thus Vau is Beauty and Harmony. The *Man* is Hakemah;
the *Eagle*, Binah; the *Lion*, Gedulah; and the *Ox*, Geburah. And the
mysterious circle is thus formed by the Sohar and all the Kabalists:
Michael and the face of the Lion are on the South, and the right hand,
with the letter ‏ו ?Y‎, [Yo\_d](errata.htm#39.md), and Water; Gabriel and
the face of the Ox, on the North, and left hand, with the first ‏ו ?H‎
of the Tetragrammaton and Fire; Uriel and the face of the Eagle, on the
East and forward, with ‏ו ?W‎ and Air; and Raphael and the face of the
Man, on the West, and backward with the last ‏ו ?H‎, and Earth. In the
same order, the four letters represent the four worlds.

Rabbi Schimeon Ben Jochai says that the four animals of the Mysterious
Chariot, whose wheels are Netsach and Had, are Gedulah, whose face is
the Lion's; Geburah, with that of the Ox; Tephareth, with that of the
Eagle; and Malakoth, with that of the Man.

The Seven lower Sephiroth, says the *Æsch Mezareph*, will represent
Seven Metals; Gedulah and Geburah, Silver and Gold;

<span id="page_799">p. 799</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Tephareth, Iron;
Netsach and [Ho\_d](errata.htm#40.md), Tin and Copper; Yesod, Lead; and
Malakoth will be the metallic Woman and Morn of the Sages, the field
wherein are to be sowed the Seeds of the Secret Minerals, to wit, the
Water of Gold; but in these such mysteries are concealed as no tongue
can utter.

The word ‏ו ?Aם?Sה‎, Amas, is composed of the initials of the three
Hebrew words that signify Air, Water, and Fire; by which, say the
Kabalists, are denoted Benignity, Judicial Rigor, and Mercy or
Compassion mediating between them.

Malakoth, says the *Apparatus*, is called *Haikal*, Temple or Palace,
because it is the Palace of the Degree Tephareth, which is concealed and
contained in it, and Haikal denotes the place in which all things are
contained.

For the better understanding of the Kabalah, remember that Kether, or
the Crown, is treated of as a person, composed of the ten Numerations,
and as such termed Arik Anpin, or Macroprosopos:

That Hakemah is a person, and termed *Abba*, or *Father*:

That Binah is a person, and termed *Mother*, *Imma*:

That Tephareth, including all the Numerations from Khased or Gedulah to
Yesod, is a person, called Seir Anpin, or Microprosopos. These
Numerations are six in number, and are represented by the interlaced
triangle, or the Seal of Solomon.

And Malakoth is a person, and called the wife of Microprosopos. Vau
represents the Beauty or Harmony, consisting of the six parts which
constitute Seir Anpin.

The wife, Malakoth, is said to be *behind* the husband, Seir, and to
have no other cognition of him. And this is thus explained: That every
cognizable object is to be known in two ways: *à priori*, which is when
it is known by means of its cause, or of itself; or, *à posteriori* when
it is known by its effects. The most nearly perfect mode of cognition
is, when the intellect knows the thing itself, in itself, and through
itself. But if it knows the thing by its similitude or idea, or species
separate from it, or by its effects and operations, the cognition is
much feebler and more imperfect. And it is thus only that Regnum, the
wife of Seir, knows her husband, until face is turned to face, when they
unite, and she has the more nearly perfect knowledge. For then the
Deity, as limited and manifested in Seir and the Universe are one.

Vau is Tephareth, considered as the Unity in which are

<span id="page_800">p. 800</span>

the six members, of which itself is one. Tephareth, Beauty, is the
column which supports the world, symbolized by the column of the junior
Warden in the Blue Lodges. The world was first created by Judgment: and
as it could not so subsist, Mercy was conjoined with Judgment, and the
Divine Mercies sustain the Universe.

God, says the *Idra Suta*, formed all things in the form of male and
female, since otherwise the continuance of things was impossible. The
All-embracing Wisdom, issuing and shining from the Most Holy Ancient,
shines not otherwise than as male and female. Wisdom as the Father,
Intelligence the Mother, are in equilibrium as male and female, and they
are conjoined, and one shines in the other. Then they generate, and are
expanded in the Truth. Then the two are the Perfection of all things,
when they are coupled; and when the Son is in them, the summary of all
things is in one.

These things are intrusted only to the Holy Superiors, who have entered
and gone out and known the ways of the Most Holy God, so as not to err
in them, to the right hand or to the left: For these things are hidden;
and the lofty Holinesses shine in them, as light flows from the splendor
of a lamp.

These things are committed only to those who have entered and not
withdrawn; for he who has not done so had better never have been born.

All things are comprehended in the letters Vau and He; and all are one
system; and these are the letters, ‏ו ?Tה?B?Wן?Tה‎. Tabunah,
Intelligence.
