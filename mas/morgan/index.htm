<P>
This book has a controversial backstory which is part of the mythology
of anti-Freemasonry.
'Captain' William Morgan, the author, was a
disappointed Freemason in Batavia, New York.
Rejected by the local lodge, he announced that he was going
to publish a work exposing Masonic rituals and secrets.
Shortly before publication in 1826, he disappeared,
and three Masons were later convicted of kidnapping him.
Although claims were made that Morgan had been murdered, some say that
he was forced to leave the US.
Either way, it was good publicity for this book, which was published in 
1827, but bad for the Masons.
The incident led to widespread protests against Freemasons in the US, and
eventually an anti-Masonic Party, which at its height in 1832 
got seven electoral votes for William Wirt for President.
</P>
<P>
So why read this book?
Stripped of the fevered historical background, and ignoring the
publisher's antimasonic introduction, this becomes simply
one of the first published accounts of US Freemasonry
in the early 19th century.
It seems accurate, based on other published Monitors, such
as <A HREF="../dun/index.htm">Ducan's</A>.
At this perspective, <CITE>Illustrations</CITE> is no more offensive than
<CITE>Robert's Rules of Order</CITE>,
although it makes more interesting reading.
</P>
<P>
Production Notes: I have, as is the usual practice, silently cleaned up
egregious punctuation errors in the text, particularly quotation marks.
There were no obvious chapter breaks, so I have
inserted file breaks at logical boundaries in the text.
As usual, any text in small green type was added to the text by the
transcriber.--J. B. Hare.
