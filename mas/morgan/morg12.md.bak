### THE THIRD, OR MASTER MASON'S DEGREE.

<span id="img_06900"></span>

The traditional account of the death and several burials, and
resurrection of Hiram Abiff, the widow's son \[as hereafter narrated\],
admitted as facts, this degree is certainly very interesting. The Bible
informs us that there was a person of that name employed at the building
of King Solomon's Temple; but neither the Bible, the writings of
Josephus, nor any other writings, however ancient, of which I have any
knowledge, furnish any information respecting his death. It certainly is
very singular, that a man so celebrated as Hiram Abiff, was an arbiter
between Solomon, king of Israel, and Hiram, king of Tyre, universally

<span id="page_70">p. 70</span>

acknowledged as the third most distinguished man then living, and in
many respects the greatest man in the world, should pass off the stage
of action in the presence of King Solomon, three thousand three hundred
grand overseers, and one hundred and fifty thousand workmen, with whom
he had spent a number of years, and neither King Solomon, his bosom
friend, nor any other among his numerous friends even recorded his death
or anything about him. I make these remarks now, hoping that it may
induce some person who has time and capacity to investigate the subject,
and promulgate the result of his investigation. I shall let the subject
rest where it is, at present; it is not intended that it should form any
part of this little volume. The principal object of this work is to lay
before the world a true history of Freemasonry, without saying anything
for or against it.

A person who has received the two preceding degrees, and wishes to be
raised to the sublime degree of a Master Mason, is \[the lodge being
opened as in the preceding degrees\] conducted from the preparation room
to the door, <span id="img_07000"></span>

|                    |

\[the manner of preparing him is particularly explained in the lecture\]
where he gives three distinct knocks, when the Senior Warden rises and
says, "Worshipful, while we are peaceably at work on the third degree of
Masonry, under the influence of humanity, brotherly love, and affection,
the door of our lodge appears to be alarmed."

The Master to the Senior Deacon, "Brother Senior, enquire the cause of
that alarm."

The Senior Deacon then steps to the door and answers the three knocks
that have been given by three more: \[these knocks are much louder than
those given on any occasion, other than that of the admission of
candidates in the several degrees\] one knock is then given without and

<span id="page_71">p. 71</span>

answered by one within, when the door is partly opened and the Junior
Deacon asks, "Who comes there? Who comes there? Who comes there?"

The Senior Deacon answers, "A worthy brother who has been regularly
initiated as an Entered Apprentice Mason, passed to the degree of a
Fellow Craft, and now wishes for further light in Masonry by being
raised to the sublime degree of a Master Mason."

Junior Deacon to Senior Deacon, "Is it of his own free will and accord
he makes this request?"

Ans. "It is."

Junior Deacon to Senior Deacon, "Is he duly and truly prepared."

Ans. "He is."

Junior Deacon to Senior Deacon, "Is he worthy and well qualified?"

Ans. "He is."

Junior Deacon to Senior Deacon, "Has he made suitable proficiency in the
preceding degrees?"

Ans. "He has."

Junior Deacon to Senior Deacon, "By what further rights does he expect
to obtain this benefit?"

Ans. "By the benefit of a pass-word."

Junior Deacon to Senior Deacon, "Has he a pass-word?"

Ans. "He has not, but I have got it for him."

The Junior Deacon to the Senior Deacon, "Will you give it to me.?"

The Senior Deacon then whispers in the ear of the Junior Deacon, "<span
class="smallcaps">Tubal Cain</span>."

Junior Deacon says, "The pass is right. Since this is the case, you will
wait till the Worshipful Master be made acquainted with his request and
his answer returned."

The Junior Deacon then repairs to the Master and gives three knocks as
at the door; after answering of which, the same questions are asked and
answers returned as at the door, when the Master says, "Since he comes
endued with all these necessary qualifications, let him enter this
worshipful lodge, in the name of the Lord, and take heed on what he
enters."

The Junior Deacon returns to the door and says, "Let

<span id="page_72">p. 72</span>

him enter this worshipful lodge, in the name of the Lord, and take heed
on what he enters."

In entering, both points of the compass are pressed against his naked
right and left breasts, when the Junior Deacon stops the candidate and
says, "Brother, when you first entered this lodge, you were received on
the point of the compass, pressing your naked left breast, which was
then explained to you; when you entered it the second time you were
received on the angle of the square, which was also explained to you; on
entering now you are received on the two extreme points of the compass,
pressing your right and left breasts, which are thus explained: As the
most vital parts of man are contained between the two breasts, so are
the most valuable tenets of Masonry contained between the two extreme
points of the compass, which are virtue, morality, and brotherly love."

The Senior Deacon then conducts the candidate three times regularly
round the lodge. \[I wish the reader to observe, that on this, as well
as every other degree, that the Junior Warden is the first of the three
principal officers that the candidate passes, traveling with the sun
when he starts round the lodge, and that as he passes the Junior Warden,
Senior Warden and Master, the first time going round, they each give one
rap, the second time two raps, and third time three raps each. The
number of raps given on those occasions are the same as the number of
the degree, except the first degree, on which three are given, I always
thought improperly.\] During the time the candidate is traveling round
the room, the Master reads the following passages of Scripture, the
conductor and candidate traveling and the Master reading so that the
traveling and reading terminate at the same time:

"Remember now thy Creator in the days of thy youth, while the evil days
come not, nor the years draw nigh when thou shalt say, I have no
pleasure in them while the sun or the light, or the moon, or the stars
be not darkened, nor the clouds return after the rain; in the day when
the keepers of the house shall tremble, and the strong men shall bow
themselves, and the grinders shall cease because they are few, and those
that look out of the windows

<span id="page_73">p. 73</span>

be darkened, and the doors shall be shut in the streets; when the sound
of the grinding is low, and he shall rise up at the voice of the bird,
and all the daughters of music shall be brought low. Also, when they
shall be afraid of that which is high, and fears shall be in the way,
and the almond tree shall flourish, and the grasshopper shall be a
burden, and desire shall fail; because man goeth to his long home, and
the mourners go about the streets; or ever the silver cord be loosed, or
the golden bowl be broken, or the pitcher be broken at the fountain, or
the wheel at the cistern. Then shall the dust return to the earth as it
was; and the spirit shall return unto God who gave it."

The conductor and candidate halt at the Junior Warden in the South,
where the same questions are asked and answers returned as at the door.
He is then conducted to the Senior Warden in the west, where the same
questions are asked and answers returned as before; from whence he is
conducted to the Worshipful Master in the east, who asks the same
questions and receives the same answers as before, and who likewise asks
the candidate from whence he came. and whither he is traveling.

Ans. "From the west, and traveling to the east"

"Why do you leave the west, and travel to the east?"

Ans. "In search of more light."

The Master then says to the Senior Deacon, "You will please conduct him
back to the west, from whence he came and put him in care of the Senior
Warden, and request him to teach the candidate how to approach the east,
by advancing upon three upright, regular steps to the third step, his
feet forming a square, his body erect at the altar, before the
Worshipful Master, and place him in a proper position to take upon him
the solemn oath or obligation of a Master Mason."

The Master then comes to the candidate and says, "Brother, you are now
placed in a proper position \[the lecture explains it\] to take upon you
the solemn oath or obligation of a Master Mason, which I assure you, as
before, is neither to affect your religion or politics. If you are
willing to take it, repeat your name and say after me:"

I, A. B., of my own free will and accord, in the presence

<span id="page_74">p. 74</span>

of Almighty God, and this worshipful lodge of Master Masons, dedicated
to God, and held forth to the holy order of St. John, do hereby and
hereon most solemnly and sincerely promise and swear, in addition to my
former obligations, that I will not give the degree of a Master Mason to
any of an inferior degree, nor to any other being in the known world,
except it be to a true and lawful brother or brethren Master Masons,
within the body of a just and lawfully constituted lodge of such; and
not unto him nor unto them whom I shall hear so to be, but unto him and
them only whom I shall find so to be, after strict trial and due
examination, or lawful information received. Furthermore do I promise
and swear, that I will not give the Master's word which I shall
hereafter receive, neither in the lodge nor out of it, except it be on
the five points of fellowship, and then not above my breath. Furthermore
do I promise and swear, that I will not give the grand hailing sign of
distress except I am in real distress, or for the benefit of the Craft
when at work; and should I ever see that sign given or the word
accompanying it, and the person who gave it appearing to be in distress
I will fly to his relief at the risk of my life, should there be a
greater probability of saving his life than losing my own. Furthermore
do I promise and swear that I will not wrong this lodge, nor a brother
of this degree to the value of one cent, knowingly, myself, or suffer it
to be done by others, if in my power to prevent it. Furthermore do I
promise and swear, that I will not be at the initiating, passing and
raising a candidate at one communication, without a regular dispensation
from the Grand Lodge for the same.

Furthermore do I promise and swear that I will not be at the initiating,
passing, or raising a candidate in a clandestine lodge, I knowing it to
be such. Furthermore do I promise and swear that I will not be at the
initiating of an old man in dotage, a young man in nonage, an Atheist,
irreligious libertine, idiot, mad-man, hermaphrodite, or woman.
Furthermore do I promise and swear that I will not speak evil of a
brother Master Mason, neither behind his back nor before his face, but
will apprise him of all approaching danger, if in my power. Furthermore
do I promise and swear that I will not violate the chastity of a Master
Mason's wife, mother,

<span id="page_75">p. 75</span>

sister, or daughter. I knowing them to be such, nor suffer it to be done
by others, if in my power to prevent it. Furthermore do I promise and
swear that I will support the constitution of the Grand Lodge of the
state of ——, under which the lodge is held, and conform to all the
by-laws, rules, and regulations of this or any other lodge of which I
may at any time hereafter become a member.

Furthermore do I promise and swear that I will obey all regular signs,
summonses, or tokens given, handed, sent, or thrown to me from the hand
of a brother Master Mason, or from the body of a just and lawfully
constituted lodge of such, provided it be within the length of my
cable-tow.

Furthermore do I promise and swear that a Master Mason's secrets, given
to me in charge as such, and I knowing them to be such, shall remain as
secure and inviolable in my breast as in his own, when communicated to
me, murder and treason excepted; and they left to my own election.

Furthermore do I promise and swear that I will go on a Master Mason's
errand whenever required, even should I have to go bare-foot and
bare-headed, if within the length of my cable-tow.

Furthermore do I promise and swear that I will always remember a brother
Master Mason when on my knees offering up my devotions to Almighty God.

Furthermore do I promise and swear that I will be aiding and assisting
all poor, indigent Master Masons, their wives and orphans, wheresoever
disposed around the globe, as far as in my power, without injuring
myself or family materially.

Furthermore do I promise and swear that if any part of my solemn oath or
obligation be omitted at this time, that I will hold myself amenable
thereto whenever informed. To all which I do most sincerely promise and
swear, with a fixed and steady purpose of mind in me to keep and perform
the same, binding myself under no less penalty than to have my body
severed in two in the midst, and divided to the north and south, my
bowels burnt to ashes in the center, and the ashes scattered before the
four winds of heaven, that there might not the least track or trace of
remembrance remain among men. or Masons, of so vile and perjured a
wretch at

<span id="page_76">p. 76</span>

should be, were I ever to prove willfully guilty of violating any part
of this my solemn oath or obligation of a Master Mason. So help me God,
and keep me steadfast in the due performance of the same.

The Master then asks the candidate, "What do you most desire?"

The candidate answers after his prompter, "More light."

The bandage which was tied round his head in the preparation room is, by
one of the brethren who stands behind him for that purpose, loosened and
put over both eyes, and he is immediately brought to light in the same
manner as in the preceding degree, except three stamps on the floor and
three claps of the hands are given in this degree. On being brought to
light, the Master says to the candidate, "You first discover, as before,
three great lights in Masonry, by the assistance of three lesser, with
this difference: both points of the compass are elevated above the
square, which denotes to you that you are about to receive all the light
that can be conferred on you in a Master's lodge." The Master steps back
from the candidate and says, "Brother, you now discover me, as Master of
this lodge, approaching you from the east, under the sign and due-guard
of a Master Mason. "The sign<span id="img_07600"></span>

|                    |
|--------------------|
| ![](img/07600.jpg) |

is given by raising both hands and arms to the elbows, perpendicularly,
one on each side of the head, the elbows forming a square. The words
accompanying this sign, in case of distress, are, "O Lord, my God! is
there no help for the widow's son?" As the last words drop from your
lips, you let your hands fall, in that manner best calculated to
indicate solemnity. King Solomon is said to have made this exclamation
on the receipt of the information of the death of Hiram Abiff. Masons
are all charged never to give the words except in the dark, when the
sign cannot be seen.

Here Masons differ very much; some contend that Solomon gave this sign
and made this exclamation when informed

<span class="small">½ Note.—The sign as now given is shown on the next
page.</span>

<span id="page_77">p. 77</span>

of Hiram's death, and work accordingly in their lodges. Others say the
sign was given and the exclamation made at the grave, when Solomon went
to raise Hiram, and, of course, they work accordingly; that is to say,
the Master who governs the lodge, holding the latter opinion, gives the
sign, etc., at the grave, when he goes to raise the body, and vice
versa.

<span id="img_07700"></span>

|                    |
|--------------------|
| ![](img/07700.jpg) |

The Due Guard is made by holding both hands in front, palms down, as
shown in cut, and alludes to the manlier of holding the hands while
taking the obligation of Master Mason.

The Penal Sign is given by putting the right hand to the left side of
the bowels, the hand open, with the thumb next to the belly, and drawing
it across the belly, and letting it fall; this is done tolerably quick.
This alludes to the penalty of the obligation: "Having my body severed
in twain," etc. See page [75](#page_75.md). After the Master has given the
sign and due guard, which does not take more than a minute. he says,
"Brother, I now present you with my right hand, in token of brotherly
love and affection, and with it the pass-grip and word."

<span id="img_07701"></span>

|                    |
|--------------------|
| ![](img/07701.jpg) |

The pass-grip is given by pressing the thumb between the joints of the
second and third fingers where they join the hand; the word or name is
<span class="smallcaps">Tubal Cain</span>. It is the pass-word to the
Master's degree. The Master, after giving the candidate the pass-grip
and word, bids him rise and salute the Junior and Senior Wardens, and
convince them that he is an obligated Master Mason, and is in possession
of the pass-grip and word. While the Wardens are examining the
candidate, the Master returns to the east and gets an apron, and, as he
returns to the candidate, one of the Wardens (sometimes both) says to
the Master, "Worshipful. we are satisfied that Bro. —— is an obligated
Master Mason." The Master then says to the candidate, "Brother, I now
have the honor to present you with a lamb-skin or white apron, as
before, which I hope you will continue to wear, with credit to yourself
and satisfaction and advantage to the brethren; you will please carry it
to the Senior Warden in the west, who will teach you how to wear it as a
Master Mason.

The Senior Warden ties on the apron and lets the flaps

<span id="page_78">p. 78</span>

fall down before, in its natural and common situation.

The Master returns to the seat and the candidate is con. ducted to him.
Master to candidate, "Brother, I perceive you are dressed, it is of
course necessary you should have tools to work with. I will now present
you with the working tools of the Master Mason, and explain their use to
you. The working tools of a Master Mason are all the implements of
Masonry indiscriminately, but more especially the trowel. The trowel is
an instrument made use of by operative masons to spread the cement which
unites a building into one mass, but we, as Free and Accepted Masons,
are taught to make use of it for the more noble and glorious purpose of
spreading the cement of brotherly love and affection; that cement which
unites us into one sacred band or society of friends and brothers, among
whom no contention should ever exist but that noble contention, or,
rather, emulation, of who can best work or best agree. I also present
you with three precious jewels; their names are *Humanity*,
*Friendship*, and *Brotherly Love*.

Brother, you are not invested with all the secrets of this degree, nor
do I know whether you ever will be until I know how you withstand the
amazing trials and dangers that await you.

You are now about to travel, to give us a specimen of your fortitude,
perseverance, and fidelity in the preservation of what you have already
received. Fare you well, and may the Lord be with you and support you
through all your trials and difficulties." \[In some lodges they make
him pray before he starts.\] The candidate is then conducted out of the
lodge, clothed, and returns; as he enters the door his conductor says to
him, "Brother, we are now in a place representing the sanctum sanctorum,
or holy of holies, of King Solomon's temple. It was the custom of our
Grand Master, Hiram Abiff, every day at high twelve, when the Crafts
were from labor to refreshment, to enter into the sanctum sanctorum, and
offer up his devotions to the ever living God. Let us, in imitation of
him, kneel and pray." They then kneel and the conductor says the
following prayer:

"Thou, O God, knowest our down-sitting and up-rising, and understandest
our thoughts afar off, shield and defend

<span id="page_79">p. 79</span>

us from the evil intentions of our enemies, and support us under the
trials and afflictions which we are destined to endure while traveling
through this vale of tears. Man that is born of a woman is of few days
and full of trouble. He cometh forth as a flower, and is cut down, he
fleeth also as a shadow, and continueth not. Seeing his days are
determined, the number of months are with thee, thou hast appointed his
bounds that he cannot pass; turn from him that he may rest, till he
shall accomplish his day. For there is hope of a tree, if it be cut
down, that it will sprout again, and that the tender branch thereof will
not cease. But man dieth and wasteth away; yea, man giveth up the ghost,
and where is he? As the waters fall from the sea, and the flood decayeth
and drieth up, so man lieth down and riseth not up till the heavens
shall be no more. Yet, O Lord, have compassion on the children of thy
creation; administer unto them comfort in time of trouble, and save them
with an everlasting salvation. Amen, so mote it be."

They then rise, and the conductor says to the candidate: "Brother, in
further imitation of our Grand Master, Hiram Abiff, let us retire at the
south gate." They then advance to the Junior Warden \[who represents
*Jubela*, one of the ruffians\], who exclaims, "Who comes here?" \[The
room is dark, or the candidate hoodwinked.\] The conductor answers,
"Grand Master, Hiram Abiff."

"Our Grand Master, Hiram Abiff!" exclaims the ruffian; "he is the very
man I wanted to see." \[Seizing the candidate by the throat at the same
time, and jerking him about with violence.\] "Give me the Master Mason's
word or I'll take your life!" The conductor replies, "I cannot give it
now, hut if you will wait till the Grand Lodge assembles at Jerusalem,
if you are found worthy, you shall then receive it, otherwise you
cannot." The ruffian then gives the candidate a blow with the
twenty-four inch gauge across the throat, on which he fled to the west
gate, where he was accosted by the second ruffian, *Jubelo*, with more
violence, and on his refusal to comply with his request, he gave him a
severe blow with the square across his breast, on which he attempted to
make his escape at the east gate, where he was accosted by the third
ruffian, *Jubelum*, with still more violence, and on refusing to

<span id="page_80">p. 80</span>

comply with his request, the ruffian gave him a violent blow with the
common gavel on the forehead, which brought him

<span id="img_08000"></span> ![](img/08000.jpg)

to the floor; on which one of them exclaimed, "What shall we do? We have
killed our Grand Master, Hiram Abiff!"

Another answers, "Let us carry him out of the east gate, and bury him in
the rubbish till low twelve, and then meet and carry him a westerly
course and bury him."

The candidate is taken up in a blanket, on which he fell, and carried to
the west end of the lodge, and covered up and left; by this time the
Master has resumed his seat \[King Solomon is supposed to arrive at the
temple at this juncture\] and calls to order, and asks the Senior Warden
the cause of all that confusion.

The Senior Warden answers, "Our Grand Master, Hiram Abiff, is missing,
and there are no plans or designs laid down on the Trestle-board for the
Craft to pursue their labors."

The Master, alias King Solomon, replies, "Our Grand Master missing! Our
Grand Master has always been very punctual in his attendance; I fear he
is indisposed; assemble the Crafts, and search in and about the temple,
and see if he can be found.

They all shuffle about the floor awhile, when the Master calls them to
order and asks the Senior Warden, "What success?"

<span id="page_81">p. 81</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> He answers, "We
cannot find our Grand Master, my lord."

The Master then orders the Secretary to call the roll of workmen and see
whether any of them are missing.

The Secretary calls the roll and says, "I have called the roll, my lord,
and find that there are three missing, viz.: Jubela, Jubelo, and
Jubelum."

His lordship then observed, "This brings to my mind a circumstance that
took place this morning. Twelve Fellow Crafts, clothed in white gloves
and aprons, in token of their innocence, carne to me and confessed that
they twelve, with three others, had conspired to extort the Master
Mason's word from their Grand Master, Hiram Abiff, and in case of
refusal to take his life. They twelve had recanted, but feared the other
three had been base enough to carry their atrocious designs into
execution."

Solomon then ordered twelve Fellow Crafts to be drawn from the bands of
the workmen, clothed in white gloves and aprons, in token of their
innocence, and sent three east, three west, three north, and three south
in search of the ruffians, and if found to fetch them forward.

Here the members all shuffle about the floor awhile, and fall in with a
reputed traveler, and inquire of him if he had seen any traveling men
that way; he tells them that he has seen three that morning near the
coast of Joppa, who from their dress and appearance were Jews, and who
were workmen from the temple, inquiring for a passage to Ethiopia, but
were unable to obtain one in consequence of an embargo which had
recently been laid on all the shipping, and had turned back into the
country.

The Master now calls them to order again, and asks the Senior Warden,
"What success?" He answers by relating what had taken place.

Solomon observes, "I had this embargo laid to prevent the ruffians from
making their escape," and adds, "You will go and search again, and
search till you find them, if possible, and if they are not found the
twelve who confessed shall be considered as the reputed murderers and
suffer accordingly."

The members all start again and shuffle about awhile,

<span id="page_82">p. 82</span>

until one of them, as if by accident, finds the body of Hiram Abiff,
alias the candidate, and hails his traveling companions, who join him,
and while they are hammering out something over the candidate the three
reputed ruffians, who are seated in a private corner near the candidate,
are heard to exclaim in the following manner:

First, Jubela—"O that my throat had been cut across, my tongue torn out,
and my body burled in the rough sands of the sea, at low water mark,
where the tide ebbs and flows twice in twenty-four hours, ere I had been
accessory to the death of so good a man as our Grand Master, Hiram
Abiff!"

The second, Jubelo—"O that my left breast had been torn open and my
heart and vitals taken from thence and thrown over my left shoulder,
carried into the valley of Jehosaphat, and there to become a prey to the
wild beasts of the field and vultures of the air, ere I had conspired
the death of so good a man as our Grand Master, Hiram Abiff!"

The third, Jubelum—"O that my body had been severed in two in the midst,
and divided to the north and south, my bowels burnt to ashes in the
center, and the ashes scattered by the four winds of heaven, that there
might not the least track or remembrance remain among men, or Masons, of
so vile and perjured a wretch as I am; ah, Jubela and Jubelo, it was I
that struck him harder than you both. It was I that gave him the fatal
blow; it was I that killed him outright;"

The three Fellow Crafts who had stood by the candidate all this time,
listening to the ruffians, whose voices they recognized, say, one to the
other:

"What shall we do; there are three of them, and only three of us?"

"It is," said one, in reply; "our cause is good, let us seize them."

On which they rush forward, seize and carry them to the Master, to whom
they relate what had passed. The Master then addresses them in the
following manner \[they in many lodges kneel or lie down, in token of
their guilt and penitence\]:

"Well, Jubela, what have you got to say for yourself, guilty or not
guilty?"

<span id="page_83">p. 83</span>

Ans. "Guilty, my lord."

"Jubelo, guilty or not guilty?"

Ans. "Guilty, my lord."

"Jubelum, guilty or not guilty?"

Ans. "Guilty, my lord."

The Master, to the three Fellow Crafts who took them:

"Take them without the west gate of the temple and have them executed
according to the several imprecations of their own mouths."

They are then hurried off to the west end of the room. Here this part of
the farce ends. The Master then orders fifteen Fellow Crafts to be
selected from the bands of workmen, and sent, three east, three west,
three north, three south, and three in and about the temple, in search
of their Grand Master, Hiram Abiff \[in some lodges they send only
twelve, when their own lectures say fifteen were sent\], and charges
them, if they find the body, to examine carefully on and about it for
the Master's word or a key to it. The three that travel a westerly
course come to the candidate, and finger about him a little, and are
called to order by the Master, when they report that they had found the
grave of their Grand Master, Hiram Abiff, and, on moving the earth till
they come to the body, they involuntarily found their hands raised in
this position (showing it at the same time; it is the due-guard of this
degree), to guard their nostrils against the offensive effluvia which
arose from the grave, and that they had searched carefully on and about
the body for the Master's word, but had not discovered anything but a
faint resemblance of the letter G on the left breast. The Master, on the
receipt of this information (raising himself), raises his hands three
several times above his head (as herein before described) and exclaims,
"Nothing but a faint resemblance of the letter G! That is not the
Master's word nor a key to it. I fear the Master's word is forever lost!
Nothing but a faint resemblance to the letter G! That is not the
Master's word nor a key to it. I fear the Master's word is forever lost!
\[The third acclamation is different from the other two; attend to it.
It has been described on page [76](#page_76.md).\] Nothing but a faint
resemblance of the letter G! That is not the Master's word

nor a key to it. O Lord, my God, is there no help for the widow's son?"

The Master then orders the Junior Warden to summon a lodge of Entered
Apprentice Masons, and repair to the grave and try to raise their Grand
Master by the Entered Apprentice's grip. They go to the candidate and
take hold of his forefinger and pull it; return and tell the Master that
they could not raise him by the Entered Apprentice's grip; that the skin
cleaved from the bone. A lodge of Fellow Crafts are then sent, who act
as before, except that they pull the candidate's second finger. The
Master then directs the Senior Warden (generally) to summon a lodge of
Master Masons, and says, "I will go with them myself in person, and try
to raise the body by the Master's grip, or lion's paw." \[Some say by
the strong grip, or lion's paw.\] They then all assemble round the
candidate, the Master having declared that the first word spoken after
the body was raised should be adopted as a substitute for the Master's
word, for the government of Master Masons’ lodges in all future
generations. He proceeds to raise the candidate, *alias* the
representative of the dead body of Hiram Abiff. He (the candidate) is
raised on what is called the five points of fellowship, which are foot
to foot, knee to knee, breast to breast, hand to back and mouth<span
id="img_08400"></span>

to ear. This is done by putting the inside of your right foot to the
inside of the right foot of the person to whom you are going to give the
word, the inside of your knee to his, laying your right breast against
his, your left hands on the back of each other, and your mouths to each
other's right ear (in which position alone you are permitted to give the
word), and whisper the word *Mahhahbone*.<span id="img_08401"></span>

|                    |

The Master's grip is given by taking hold of each other's hand as though
you were going to shake hands, and sticking the nails of each of your
fingers into the joint of the other's wrist where it unites with the
hand. In this position

<span id="page_85">p. 85</span>

the candidate is raised, he keeping his whole body stiff, as though
dead. The Master, in raising him, is assisted by some of the brethren,
who take hold of the candidate by the arms and shoulders; as soon as he
is raised to his feet, they step back and the Master whispers the word
Mah-hah-bone in his ear, and causes the candidate to repeat it, telling
him, at the same time, that he must never give it in any manner other
than that in which he receives it. He is also told that Mah-hah-bone
signifies marrow in the bone. They then separate, and the Master then
makes the following explanation respecting the five points of
fellowship:

Master to candidate. "Brother, foot to foot teaches you that you should,
whenever asked, go on a brother's errand, if within the length of your
cable-tow, even if you should have to go barefoot and bareheaded. Knee
to knee, that you should always remember a Master Mason in your
devotions to Almighty God. Breast to breast, that you should keep the
Master Mason's secrets, when given to you in charge as such, as secure
and inviolable in your breast as they were in his own before
communicated to you. Hand to back, that you should support a Master
Mason behind his back as before his face. Mouth to ear, that you should
support his good name as well behind his back as before his face."

After the candidate is through with what is called the work part, the
Master addresses him in the following manner: "Brother, you may suppose,
from the manner you have been dealt with to-night, that we have been
fooling with you, or that we have treated you different from others; but
I assure you that is not the case. You have this night represented one
of the greatest men that ever lived in the tragical catastrophe of his
death, burial, and resurrection; I mean Hiram Abiff, the widow's son,
who was slain by three ruffians at the building of King Solomon's
temple, and who, in his inflexibility, integrity, and fortitude, never
was surpassed by man. The history of that momentous event is thus
related: Masonic tradition informs us that, at the building of King
Solomon's temple, fifteen Fellow Crafts, discovering that the temple was
almost finished, and not having the Master Mason's word, became very
impatient and entered into a horrid conspiracy to extort the Master
Mason's word from their

<span id="page_86">p. 86</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Grand Master,
Hiram Abiff, the first time they met him alone, or take his life, that
they might pass as Masters in other countries, and receive wages as
such, but, before they could accomplish their designs, twelve of them
recanted, but the other three were base enough to carry their atrocious
designs into execution. Their names were Jubela, Jubelo, and Jubelum. It
was the custom of our Grand Master, Hiram Abiff, every day at high
twelve, when the Craft were from labor to refreshment, to enter into the
sanctum sanctorum and offer up his devotions to the ever-living God, and
draw out his plans and designs on the trestle-board, for the Crafts to
pursue their labor. On a certain day (not named in any of our
traditional accounts) Jubela, Jubelo, and Jubelum placed themselves at
the south, west, and east gates of the temple, and Hiram, having
finished his devotions and labor, attempted (as was his usual custom) to
retire at the south gate, where he was met by Jubela, who demanded of
him the Master Mason's word \[some say the secrets of a Master Mason\],
and on his refusal to give it Jubela gave him a violent blow with the
twenty-four inch gauge across the throat; on which Hiram fled to the
west gate, where he was accosted in the same manner by Jubelo, but with
more violence. Hiram told him that he could not give the word then
because Solomon, king of Israel, Hiram, king of Tyre, and himself had
entered into a solemn league that the word never should be given unless
they three were present; but, if he would wait with patience till the
Grand Lodge assembled at Jerusalem, if he was then found worthy he
should receive it, otherwise he could not. Jubelo replied, in a very
peremptory manner: 'If you do not give me the Master's word I'll take
your life'; and on Hiram's refusal to give it Jubelo gave him a severe
blow with the square across the left breast, on which he fled to the
east gate, where he was accosted by Jubelum in the same manner, but with
still more violence. Here Hiram reasoned as before; Jubelum told him
that he had heard his caviling with Jubela and Jubelo long enough, and
that he was still put off, and the temple was almost finished, and he
was determined to have the word or take his life. 'I want it so that I
may be able to get wages as a Master Mason in any country to which I may
go for employ, after the temple is finished, and that I might be

<span id="page_87">p. 87</span>

able to support my wife and children.' Hiram persisting in his refusal,
he gave Hiram a violent blow with the gavel on the forehead, which
felled him to the floor and killed him. They took the body and carried
it out of the east gate and buried it in the rubbish till low twelve at
night (which is 12 o'clock), when the three met, agreeable to
appointment, and carried the body a westerly direction, and buried it at
the brow of a hill, in a grave dug due east and west, six feet
perpendicular, and made their escape. King Solomon, coming up to the
temple at low six in the morning (as was his usual custom), found the
Crafts all in confusion, and, on inquiring the cause, was informed that
their Grand Master, Hiram Abiff, was missing, and there were no plans
and designs laid down on the trestle-board for the Crafts to pursue
their labor. Solomon ordered immediate search to be made in and about
the Temple for him; no discovery being made, he then ordered the
Secretary to call the roll of workmen, to see if any were missing; it
appearing that there were three, viz: Jubela, Jubelo and Jubelum,
Solomon observed:

"This brings to my mind a circumstance that took place this morning.
Twelve Fellow Crafts came to me, dressed in white gloves and aprons in
token of their innocence, and confessed that they twelve with three
others had conspired to extort the Master Mason's word from their Grand
Master, Hiram Abiff, and in case of his refusal to take his life; they
twelve had recanted, but feared the other three had been base enough to
carry their atrocious design into execution."

Solomon immediately ordered twelve Fellow Crafts to be selected from the
bands of the workmen, clothed in white gloves and aprons in token of
their innocence, and sent three east, three west, three north and three
south, in search of the ruffians, and if found to bring them up before
him. The three that traveled a westerly course, coming near the coast of
Joppa, fell in with a warfaring man, who informed them that he had seen
three men pass that way that morning, who, from their appearance and
dress, were workmen from the Temple, inquiring for a passage to
Ethiopia, but were unable to obtain one in consequence of an embargo
which had recently been laid on all the shipping, and had turned back
into the country. After making still further and more diligent search,

<span id="page_88">p. 88</span>

and after making no further discovery, they returned to the Temple and
reported to Solomon the result of their pursuit and inquiries. On which
Solomon directed them to go and search again, and search until they
found their Grand Master, Hiram Abiff, if possible, and if he was not
found, the twelve who had confessed should be considered as the
murderers and suffer accordingly.

They returned again in pursuit of the ruffians, and one of the three
that traveled a westerly course, being more weary than the rest, sat
down at the brow of a hill to rest and refresh himself; and in
attempting to rise caught hold of a sprig of cassia, which easily gave
way and excited his curiosity, and made him suspicious of a deception,
on which he hailed his companions, who immediately assembled, and on
examination found that the earth had been recently moved; and, on moving
the rubbish, discovered the appearance of a grave; and while they were
confabulating about what measure to take, they heard voices issuing from
a cavern in the clefts of the rocks, on which they immediately repaired
to the place, where they heard the voice of Jubela exclaim, "O! that my
throat had been cut across, my tongue torn out, and my body buried in
the rough sands of the sea at low water-mark, where the tide ebbs and
flows twice in twenty-four hours, ere I had been accessory to the death
of so good a man as our Grand Master, Hiram Abiff." On which they
distinctly heard the voice of Jubelo exclaim, "O! that my breast had
been torn open, and my heart and vitals taken from thence and thrown
over my left shoulder, to the valley of Jehosaphat, there to become a
prey to the wild beasts of the field and vultures of the air, ere I had
conspired to take the life of so good a man as our Grand Master, Hiram
Abiff. When they more distinctly heard the voice of Jubelum exclaim, "O!
that my body had been severed in two in the midst, and divided to the
north and the south, my bowels burnt to ashes in the center, and the
ashes scattered by the four winds of heaven, that there might not remain
the least track or trace of remembrance among men or Masons of so vile
and perjured a wretch as I am, who wilfully took the life of so good a
man as our Grand Master, Hiram Abiff. Ah! Jubela and Jubelo, it was I
that struck him harder than you both! It

<span id="page_89">p. 89</span>

was I that gave him the fatal blow! It was I that killed him outright!"
On which they rushed forward, seized, bound, and carried them up before
King Solomon, who, after hearing the testimony of the three Fellow
Crafts, and the three ruffians having plead guilty, ordered them to be
taken out at the west gate of the Temple and executed agreeable to the
several imprecations of their own mouths. King Solomon then ordered
fifteen Fellow Crafts to be selected from the bands of the workmen,
clothed with white gloves and aprons, in token of their innocence, and
sent three east, three west, three north, three south and three in and
about the Temple, in search of the body of their Grand Master, Hiram
Abiff, and the three that traveled a westerly course found it under that
sprig of cassia, where a worthy brother sat down to rest and refresh
himself; and on removing the earth till they came to the coffin, they
involuntarily found their hands raised, as herein before described, to
guard their nostrils against the offensive effluvia that arose from the
grave. It is also said that the body had lain there fourteen days, some
say fifteen, The body was raised in the manner herein before described,
carried up to the Temple, and buried as explained in the closing clauses
of the lecture. Not one third part of the preceding history of this
degree is ever given to a candidate. A few general, desultory,
unconnected remarks are made to him, and he is generally referred to the
manner of raising, and the lecture, for information as to the
particulars. Here follows a charge which ought to be and sometimes is
delivered to the candidate after hearing the history of the degree.

*An address to be delivered to the candidate after the history has been
given*.

"Brother, your zeal for the institution of Masonry, the progress you
have made in the mystery, and your conformity to our regulations, have
pointed you out as a proper object of our favor and esteem. You are
bound by duty, honor and gratitude to be faithful to your trust, to
support the dignity of your character on every occasion, and to enforce,
by precept and example, obedience to the tenets of the order. In the
character of Master Mason, you are authorized to correct the errors and
irregularities of your uninformed brethren,

<span id="page_90">p. 90</span>

and to guard them against breach of fidelity. To preserve the reputation
of the fraternity, unsullied, must be your constant care—and for this
purpose it is your province to recommend to your inferiors, obedience
and submission; to your equals, courtesy and affability; to your
superiors, kindness and condescension. Universal benevolence you are
always to inculcate; and by the regularity of your own behavior, afford
the best example for the conduct of others less informed. The ancient
landmarks of the order, entrusted to your care, you are carefully to
preserve; and never suffer them to be infringed, or countenance a
deviation from the established usages and customs of the fraternity.
Your virtue, honor, and reputation are concerned in supporting with
dignity the character you now bear. Let no motive, therefore, make you
swerve from your duty, violate your vows, or betray your trust; but be
true and faithful, and imitate the example of that celebrated artist
whom you this evening represent; thus you will render yourself deserving
the honor which we have conferred, and merit the confidence that we have
reposed."

Here follows the lecture on this degree, which is divided into three
sections.
