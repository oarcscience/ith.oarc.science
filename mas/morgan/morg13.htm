<p>"Are you a Master Mason"</p>  
<p>Ans. "I am&#8212;try me, prove me&#8212;disprove me if yon can."</p>  
<p>"Where were you prepared to be made a Master Mason?"</p>  
<p>Ans. "In a room adjacent to the body of a just and lawfully constituted lodge of such, duly assembled in a room representing the sanctum sanctorum, or holy of holies, of King Solomon's Temple."</p>  
<p>"How were you prepared?"</p>  
<p>Ans. "By being divested of all metals; neither naked nor clothed; barefoot nor shod; with a cable-tow three times about my naked body; in which posture I was conducted to the door of the lodge, where I gave three distinct knocks."</p>  
<p>"What did those three distinct knocks allude to?"</p>  
<p>Ans. "To the third degree of Masonry; it being that on</p>  
<p><a name="page_91"><font size="1" color="green">p. 91</font></A></p>  
<p>which I was about to enter."</p>  
<p>"What was said to you from within?"</p>  
<p>Ans. "Who comes there? Who comes there? Who comes there?"</p>  
<p>"Your answer?'</p>  
<p>Ans. "A worthy brother who has been regularly initiated as an Entered Apprentice Mason, passed to the degree of a Fellow Craft, and now wishes for further light in Masonry, by being raised to the sublime degree of a Master Mason."</p>  
<p>"What further was said to you from within?"</p>  
<p>Ans. "I was asked if it was of my own free will and accord I made that request; if I was duly and truly prepared; worthy and well qualified, and had made suitable proficiency in the preceding degrees; all of which being answered in the affirmative, I was asked by what further rights I expected to obtain that benefit."</p>  
<p>"Your answer?"</p>  
<p>Ans. "By the benefit of a pass-word."</p>  
<p>"What is that pass-word?"</p>  
<p>Ans. "<i>Tubal Cain</i>."</p>  
<p>"What next was said to you?"</p>  
<p>Ans. "I was bid to wait till the Worshipful Master in the east was made acquainted with my request and his answer returned."</p>  
<p>"What followed after his answer was returned?"</p>  
<p>Ans. "I was caused to enter the lodge on the two extreme points of the compass, pressing my naked right and left breasts, in the name of the Lord."</p>  
<p>"How were you then disposed of?"</p>  
<p>Ans. "I was conducted three times regularly round the lodge, and halted at the Junior Warden in the south, where the same questions were asked and answers returned as at the door."</p>  
<p>"How did the Junior Warden dispose of you?"</p>  
<p>Ans. "He ordered me to be conducted to the Senior Warden in the west, where the same questions were asked and answers returned as before."</p>  
<p>"How did the Senior Warden dispose of you?"</p>  
<p>Ans. "He ordered me to be conducted to the Worshipful Master in the east, where by him the same questions were asked, and answers returned as before, who likewise demanded</p>  
<p><a name="page_92"><font size="1" color="green">p. 92</font></A></p>  
<p>of me from whence I came, and whither I was traveling."</p>  
<p>"Your answer?"</p>  
<p>Ans. "From the east and traveling to the west"</p>  
<p>"Why do you leave the east, and travel to the west?"</p>  
<p>Ans. "In search of light."</p>  
<p>"How did the Worshipful Master then dispose of you?"</p>  
<p>Ans. "He ordered me to be conducted back to the west, from whence I came, and put in care of the Senior Warden, who taught me how to approach the east, by advancing upon three upright, regular steps to the third step, my feet forming a square and my body erect at the altar before the Worshipful Master."</p>  
<p>"What did the Worshipful Master do with you?"</p>  
<p>Ans. "He made an obligated Master Mason of me."</p>  
<p>"How?"</p>  
<p>Ans. "In due form."</p>  
<p>"What was that due form?"</p>  
<p>Ans. "Both my knees bare bent, they forming a square; both hands on the Holy Bible, Square and Compass; in which posture I took upon me the solemn oath or obligation of a Master Mason."</p>  
<p>"After your obligation, what was said to you?"</p>  
<p>Ans. "What do you most desire?"</p>  
<p>"Your answer?"</p>  
<p>Ans. "More light."</p>  
<p>[The bandage round the head is now dropped over the eyes.]</p>  
<p>"Did you receive light?"</p>  
<p>Ans. "I did."</p>  
<p>"On being brought to light on this degree, what did you first discover?"</p>  
<p>Ans. "Three great lights in Masonry, by the assistance of three lesser, and both points of the compass elevated above the square, which denoted to me that I had received, or was about to receive all the light that could be conferred on me in a Master's Lodge."</p>  
<p>"What did you next discover?"</p>  
<p>Ans. "The Worshipful Master approaching me from the east, under the sign and due-guard of a Master Mason, who presented me with his right hand in token of brotherly love</p>  
<p><a name="page_93"><font size="1" color="green">p. 93</font></A></p>  
<p>and confidence, and proceeded to give me the pass-grip and word of a Master Mason, [the word is the name of the pass-grip] and bid me arise and salute the Junior and Senior Wardens and convince them that I was an obligated Master Mason, and had the sign, pass-grip and word. [Tubal Cain.] "What did you next discover?"</p>  
<p>Ans. "The Worshipful Master approaching me the second time from the east, who presented me with a lamb-skin or white apron, which he said he hoped I would continue to wear, with honor to myself, and satisfaction and advantage to the brethren."</p>  
<p>"What were you next presented with?"</p>  
<p>Ans. "The working tools of a Master Mason."</p>  
<p>"What are they?"</p>  
<p>Ans. "All the implements of Masonry indiscriminately, but more especially the trowel."</p>  
<p>"How explained?"</p>  
<p>Ans. "The trowel is an instrument made use of by operative masons to spread the cement which unites a building into one common mass, but we, as Free and Accepted Masons, are taught to make use of it for the more noble and glorious purpose of spreading the cement of brotherly love and affection, that cement which unites us into one sacred band or society of brothers, among whom no contention should ever exist, but that noble emulation of who can best work or best agree."</p>  
<p>"What were you next presented with?"</p>  
<p>Ans. "Three precious jewels."</p>  
<p>"What are they?"</p>  
<p>Ans. "Humanity, friendship and brotherly love."</p>  
<p>"How were you then disposed of?"</p>  
<p>Ans. "I was conducted out of the lodge and invested with what I had been divested, and returned again in due season."</p>
