### INTRODUCTION.

#### (WRITTEN FOR THE ORIGINAL EDITION.

##### *By the Publisher, Col. David C. Miller, Batavia, N. Y.*)

In the absence of the author, or rather compiler of the following work,
who was kidnapped and carried away from the village of Batavia, on the
11th day of September, 1826, by a number of Freemasons, it devolves upon
the publisher to attempt to set forth some of the leading views that
governed those who embarked in the undertaking.

To contend with prejudice, and to struggle against customs and opinions,
which superstition, time, and ignorance have hallowed, requires time,
patience, and magnanimity. When we begin to pull down the strongholds of
error, the batteries we level against them, though strong, and powerful;
and victorious at last, arc at first received with violence; and when in
our conquering career we meet with scoffs and revilings from the
beseiged partisans of untenable positions, it the more forcibly
impresses us we are but men; and that in every work of reformation and
renovation we must encounter various difficulties. For a full
confirmation of our statement we might refer to the history of the
world. It is not our intention, however, to give a full detail of the
whims and caprices man to bring forth the historic records of other
years as roof of the windings and shiftings of the various characters
who have "Strutted their brief hour on life's stage" in order to
convince that customs, associations, and institutions are like the lives
of the authors and abettors, fleeting and fragile. Many of them rise up
as bubbles on the ocean, and die away. Circumstances give them
existence, and when these causes cease to exist, they go into the same
gulf of oblivion as countless exploded opinions and tenets have gone
before them. The mind that formed and planned them, goes on in its
dazzling flight, bounding over barrier after barrier, till it has
arrived at the ultimate goal of consummation.

The daily occurrences before us bring forth the full conviction that the
emanation from the God of light is gradually ascending to regions of
greater intellectual brilliancy.

<span id="page_iv">p. iv</span>

When we view man, in the infancy of society, as in the childhood of his
existence, he is weak, powerless and defenceless; but in his manhood and
riper years, he has grown to his full stature, and stands forth in
commanding attitude, the favored and acknowledged lord of the world. For
his comfort and well-being as a member of society, rules and regulations
are necessary. In the various stages of his progress, these systematic
improvements undergo various changes, according to circumstances and
situations. What is proper and necessary in one grade of society, is
wholly useless, and may be alarming in another. Opinions and usages that
go down in tradition, and interfere not with our improvements in social
concerns, adhere to us more closely and become entwined in all our
feelings. It is to this we owe our bigoted attachment to antiquity—it is
this that demands from us a superstitious reverence for the opinions and
practices of men of former times, and closes the ear against truth, and
blinds the eyes to the glare of new lights and new accessions of
knowledge through which medium only can they break in upon the mind.

We have within ourselves the knowledge; and everywhere around us the
proofs that we are beings destined not to stand still. In our present
state of advancement, we lock with pity on the small progress of our
fathers in arts and sciences, and social institutions; and when compared
with our elevated rank, we have just cause of pride and of grateful
feelings. They did well for the times in which they lived, but to the
ultimatum of perfectability we are nearer, and in the monuments we have
before us of the skill and genius of our times and age we have only
fulfilled these destinies for which we were created; and we object to
every obstacle that opposes or attempts to oppose the will of heaven.

In the present enlightened state to which society has advanced, we
contend that the opinions and tenets and pretended secrecies of "olden
times," handed down to us, should be fully, fairly and freely canvassed;
that from the mist and darkness which have hung over them, they should
come out before the open light of day, and be subject to the rigid test
of candid investigation. These preliminary remarks lead as to the main
object of our introduction.

We come to lay before the world the claims of an institution

<span id="page_v">p. v</span>

which has been sanctioned by ages, venerated for wisdom, exalted for
"light;" but, an institution whose benefits have always been overrated,
and whose continuance is not in the slightest degree, necessary. We meet
it with its high requirements, its "time honored customs," its swelling
titles, and shall show it in its nakedness and simplicity. Strip it of
its "borrowed trappings" and it is a mere nothing, a toy not now worthy
the notice of a child to sport with. We look back to it as, at one
period, a "cement of society and bond of union"—we view it as, at one
time, a venerable fort—but now in ruins—which contained within its walls
many things that dignified and adorned human nature. We give it due
credit for the services it has done; but at present when light has gone
abroad into the utmost recesses and corners of the world—when
information is scattered wide around us, and knowledge is not closeted
in cloisters and cells but "stalks abroad with her beams of light, and
her honors and rewards," we may now, when our minority has expired, act
up to our character and look no longer to Masonry as our guide and
conductor; it has nothing in it now valuable that is not known to every
inquiring mind. It contains, wrapped up in its supposed mysteries, no
useful truth, no necessary knowledge that has not gone forth to the
world through. other channels and by other means. If we would have a
knowledge of sacred history—of the religion and practices of the Jews,
and the terms and technicalities of the Mosaic institutions, we can have
recourse to the Bible. If we wish further communications from heaven, we
have open to our view the pages of the New Testament. If we would "climb
the high ascent of human science, and trace the mighty progress of human
genius in every gigantic effort of mind in logic, geometry, mathematics,
chemistry, and every other branch of knowledge," we ridicule the idea
that Masonry, in her retirements, contains the arts and sciences. The
sturdiest Mason in the whole fraternity is not bold enough to uphold or
maintain the opinion for one moment in sober reality. The origin of the
institution is easily traced to the rude ages of the world—to a body of
mechanics, or a corporation of operative workmen, who formed signs and
regulations, the more easily to carry on their work, and to protect
their order. \[The very obligations solemnly tendered to every member,

<span id="page_vi">p. vi</span>

carry the strongest internal evidence of the semi-barbarity that
prevailed at the time of the institution of the order,\] In the course
of time, as society increased, and knowledge became more general, it
spread, and embracing in its grasp other objects than at first, it
enrolled in its ranks men of the first respectability in wealth, talents
and worth. But that there is anything intrinsically valuable in the
signs, symbols, or words of Masonry, no man of sense will contend. That
there is not any hidden secret which operates as a talismanic charm on
its possessors, every man of intelligence, Mason or no Mason, must
candidly acknowledge. It is worse than idleness for the defenders of the
order, at the present day to entrench themselves behind their outward
show—the semblance before the world—and to say they are in possession of
superior knowledge.

We pretend not to act under a cover. We shall "tell the truth, the whole
truth, and nothing but the truth." Masonry, it is true, has long been
eulogized in song—it has formed the burthen of the poet's theme, and
been the subject of the orator's best performances. Fancy has been
almost exhausted in bringing out "new flowers to deck the fairy queen;"
but when we come behind the scenes, what is the picture we behold? Are
we to rest satisfied with the ipse dixit of others, or to examine the
truth for ourselves? The touchstone is before our readers in the present
publication.

Masonry is of itself naked and worthless. It consists of gleanings from
the Holy Scriptures, and from the arts and sciences, which have shone in
the world. Linking itself with philosophy and science and religion, on
this it rests all its claims to veneration and respect. Take away this
borrowed aid, and it falls into ruins.

Much weight is still attached to the argument, that as a tie uniting
men—that, as a significant speech, symbolically speaking every language,
and at the same time embodying in its constitution everything that is
valuable, it should command respect. We meet this argument with facts
that cannot be controverted. We put it on a basis that will fling into
the back ground every quibble and artifice on the subject; and, in the
language of a polemic writer, we challenge opposition to our
[position](errata.htm#0.md).

The religion inculcated by the Son of Man does all this;

<span id="page_vii">p. vii</span>

and in no possible situation can man be placed, that the benign
influence of Christianity does not completely supersede the use of a
mere human institution. Place a brother in a desert, unfriended and
unknown,—leave him in a wilderness where human footsteps never printed
the ground, the Divine Benefactor is at his side, and watches over him
with parental guidance. Let him be driven on a barbarous coast, in the
midst of savage men, and there it is that the breathings of the divine
influence spreads around him its shield, brings him into civilized
society—in the busy walks of men, and are we to be told, as members of
community, sojourners on earth, and candidates for heaven, we must be
taught our duty at a Mason's lodge? Wherever Masonry exercises its
influence with success, there Christianity can have, or should have a
more powerful effect. Whenever Masonry claims "kindred with the skies,"
and exalts herself above every living sublunary thing, then, with an
unhallowed step, it obtrudes on the sacred borders of religion, and
decks itself in borrowed garments.

Entrenched within these strong walls—decked with all the glitter of high
sounding professions, claiming what does not belong to it,—it dazzles
"but to bewilder and destroy." In its train, in these United States, are
enrolled many periodical works devoted to Masonry; and under the guise
of patronizing mechanics—the arts and sciences—lend their aid to carry
on the imposing delusion. They take up the specious title of throwing a
little illumination on this benighted country, from their secret
depositories. Arrogating to itself what should deck other's
brows—assuming to be the [patron](errata.htm#1.md), the life and soul of
all that is great and valuable—it deceives many of its votaries, and
from its *gaudy* premises the most untenable and onerous conclusions are
drawn.

Are we astonished at the wild and heedless manner in which many of the
votaries of Masonry rush into every excess, putting at defiance the laws
of our civil institutions, which suffer no one to put in jeopardy, but
by due forms, and disregarding the command of the Most High, which says,
"Thou shalt not kill?"—we can readily trace the cause to the impressions
and practices obtained from its false tenets and descriptive arrogance.
Masonry is to the modern world what the whore of Babylon was to the
ancient; and is the

<span id="page_viii">p. viii</span>

beast with seven heads and ten horns, ready to tear out our bowels, and
*scatter them to the four winds of heaven*. Masonry gives rogues and
evil-minded characters an opportunity of visiting upon their devoted
victim, all the ills at tending combined power, when exerted to
accomplish destruction. It works unseen, at all silent hours, and secret
times and places; and, like death when summoning his diseases, pounces
upon its devoted subject, and lays him prostrate in the dust. Like the
great enemy of man, it has shown its cloven foot, and put the public
upon its guard against its Secret machinations.

This part of the subject requires no further discussion either by way of
ridicule or downright sincerity, but the remark which cannot be too
often reiterated, that the world, in its present advanced state,
requires no such order for our social intercourse; and when the Masonic
mania prevails as it now does in this country, we are exalting a mere
human ordinance, with its useless trumpery and laughable accompaniments,
for the sublime and unadorned lessons of Heaven.

To some men it is galling and mortifying in the extreme to give up their
darling systems. With the increase of years their fondness becomes so
great that they cling to them with wild and bewildered attachment. But
we would ask them, where now are the Knights of Malta and Jerusalem, and
the objects that called forth their perils and journeyings? Where are
the crusades and excursions on which our Grand Commanders,
Generalissimos and Sir Knights are to be engaged . . . . . . . . . In no
other excursions than Cervantes describes of his redoubtable hero *Don
Quixote*. The days and occasions that called forth these deeds of
chivalry and valor have passed like those before the flood; and the mock
dignitaries and *puppet show* actions of Masons in their imitation call
forth pity and indignation. When we now see the gaudy show in a
lodge-room, and a train of nominal officers with their distinction and
badges, it may give us some faint idea of scenes that are past, and may
gratify an idle curiosity, but produces no substantial good under
heaven. When monasteries and cloisters, and inquisitor's cells and
prisons have been broken up before the sweeping march of the moral mind,
why this unnecessary mummery should be so much countenanced in this
country, above all other

<span id="page_ix">p. ix</span>

countries in the world, is a matter of astonishment.

The day we trust will never arrive here, when ranks in Masonry will be
stepping-stones to places of dignity and power—when this institution
will be a machine to press down the free born spirit of men. We have now
no tyrant to rule over us—no kingly potentate to move over our heads the
rod of authority; but high in our elevation, and invincible in our
strongholds, we put at defiance secret cabals and associations. The
public opinion is like a mighty river, and gigantic in its course it
will sweep every interposing obstacle before it.

In the work which we submit to the public we have given false coloring
to nothing; nor in these remarks have we set down aught in malice. In
the firm discharge of our undertaking we have been stern and unbending
as the rugged mountain oak; and persecutions, pains and perils have not
deterred us from our purpose. We have triumphed over tumult, and clamor,
and evil speaking.

When our book goes out to the world, it will meet with attacks of a
violent nature from one source, and men of mock titles and order will
endeavor to heap upon it every calumny. Men more tenacious of absolute
forms and practice than they are attentive to truth and honor, will deny
our expositions, and call us liars and impostors.

Such is the treatment, however ungenerous and unjust, which we expect to
meet, and for which we are prepared. Truth, we know, is majestic and
will finally prevail. The little petty effusions of malice that will be
thrown out, will die with their authors, whom this work will survive.

We now aver, in defiance of whatever may be said to the contrary—no
matter by whom, how exalted his rank—that this book is what it pretends
to be; that it is a master key to the secrets of Masonry; that in the
pages before him. the man of candor and inquiry can judge for himself,
and then a proper judgment will be formed of our intention.
