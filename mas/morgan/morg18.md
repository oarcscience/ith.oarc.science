<span class="smallcaps">Preparation of Candidate Master Mason's
Degree</span>.—He is conducted into the preparation room as in the
preceding degree. All his clothing is removed as before; both legs of
the drawers are tucked up above the knees, both sleeves of the shirt are
tucked up above the elbows, both breasts of the shirt are turned, making
both breasts bare. The hoodwink is again fastened over both eyes and the
cable-tow is put three times around his body. No slipper is used in this
degree. Should the shirt be closed in front, it must be taken off or
turned front backwards, as both breasts must be bare. An apron is then
tied on and worn as a Fellow Craft, and thus he is "duly and truly
prepared."

Worshipful Master to Candidate, "You will advance to the altar, kneel
upon both your naked knees, both hands resting n the Holy Bible, square
and compass in which due form you will say, "I," with your name in full
and repeat after me"

towards the body. Then drop the hand perpendicularly to the side.
