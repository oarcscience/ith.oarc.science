*It began to shape itself to my intellectual vision into something more
imposing and majestic, solemnly mysterious and grand. It seemed to me
like the Pyramids in their loneliness, in whose yet undiscovered
chambers may be hidden, for the enlightenment of coming generations, the
sacred books of the Egyptians, so long lost to the world; like the
Sphynx half buried in the desert*.

*In its symbolism, which and its spirit of brotherhood are its essence,
Freemasonry is more ancient than any of the world's living religions. It
has the symbols and doctrines which, older than himself, Zarathrustra
inculcated; and it seemed to me a spectacle sublime, yet pitiful—the
ancient Faith of our ancestors holding out to the world its symbols once
so eloquent, and mutely and in vain asking for an interpreter*.

*And so I came at last to see that the true greatness and majesty of
Freemasonry consist in its proprietorship of these and its other
symbols; and that its symbolism is its soul*.

—ALBERT PIKE, *Letter to Gould*

### CHAPTER II

### The Working Tools

NEVER were truer words than those of Goethe in the last lines of Faust,
and they echo one of the oldest instincts of humanity: "All things
transitory but as symbols are sent." From the beginning man has divined
that the things open to his senses are more than mere facts, having
other and hidden meanings. The whole world was close to him as an
infinite parable, a mystical and prophetic scroll the lexicon of which
he set himself to find. Both he and his world were so made as to convey
a sense of doubleness, of high truth hinted in humble, nearby things. No
smallest thing but had its skyey aspect which, by his winged and
quick-sighted fancy, he sought to surprise and grasp.

Let us acknowledge that man was born a poet, his mind a chamber of
imagery, his world a gallery of art. Despite his utmost efforts, he can
in nowise strip his thought of the flowers and fruits that cling to it,
withered though they often are. As a fact, he has ever been a citizen of
two worlds, using the

<span id="page_20">p. 20</span>

scenery of the visible to make vivid the realities of the world Unseen.
What wonder, then, that trees grew in his fancy, flowers bloomed in his
faith, and the victory of spring over winter gave him hope of life after
death, while the march of the sun and the great stars invited him to
"thoughts that wander through eternity." Symbol was his native tongue,
his first form of speech—as, indeed, it is his last—whereby he was able
to say what else he could not have uttered. Such is the fact, and even
the language in which we state it is "a dictionary of faded metaphors,"
the fossil poetry of ages ago.

#### I

That picturesque and variegated maze of the early symbolism of the race
we cannot study in detail, tempting as it is. Indeed, so luxuriant was
that old picture-language that we may easily miss our way and get lost
in the labyrinth, unless we keep to the right path. <span
id="fr_9"></span>[1](#fn_9.md) First of all, throughout

<span id="page_21">p. 21</span>

this study of prophecy let us keep ever in mind a very simple and
obvious fact, albeit not less wonderful because obvious. Socrates made
the discovery—perhaps the greatest ever made—that human nature is
universal. By his searching questions he found out that when men think
round a problem, and think deeply, they disclose a common nature and a
common system of truth. So there dawned upon him, from this fact, the
truth of the kinship of mankind and the unity of mind. His insight is
confirmed many times over, whether we study the earliest gropings of the
human mind or set the teachings of the sages side by side. Always we
find, after comparison, that the final conclusions of the wisest minds
as to the meaning of life and the world are harmonious, if not
identical.

Here is the clue to the striking resemblances between the faiths and
philosophies of widely separated peoples, and it makes them intelligible
while adding to their picturesqueness and philosophic interest. By the
same token, we begin to understand why the same signs, symbols, and
emblems were used by all peoples to express their earliest aspiration
and

<span id="page_22">p. 22</span>

thought. We need not infer that one people learned them from another, or
that there existed a mystic, universal order which had them in keeping.
They simply betray the unity of the human mind, and show how and why, at
the same stage of culture, races far removed from each other came to the
same conclusions and used much the same symbols to body forth their
thought. Illustrations are innumerable, of which a few may be named as
examples of this unity both of idea and of emblem, and also as
confirming the insight of the great Greek that, however shallow minds
may differ, in the end all seekers after truth follow a common path,
comrades in one great quest.

An example in point, as ancient as it is eloquent, is the idea of the
trinity and its emblem, the triangle. What the human thought of God is
depends on what power of the mind or aspect of life man uses as a lens
through which to look into the mystery of things. Conceived of as the
will of the world, God is one, and we have the monotheism of Moses. Seen
through instinct and the kaleidoscope of the senses, God is multiple,
and the result is polytheism and its gods without number. For the
reason, God is a dualism made up of matter and mind, as in the faith of
Zoroaster and many other cults. But when the social life of man becomes
the prism

<span id="page_23">p. 23</span>

of faith, God is a trinity of Father, Mother, Child. Almost as old as
human thought, we find the idea of the trinity and its triangle emblem
everywhere—Siva, Vishnu, and Brahma in India corresponding to Osiris,
Isis, and Horus in Egypt. No doubt this idea underlay the old pyramid
emblem, at each corner of which stood one of the gods. No missionary
carried this profound truth over the earth. It grew out of a natural and
universal human experience, and is explained by the fact of the unity of
the human mind and its vision of God through the family.

Other emblems take us back into an antiquity so remote that we seem to
be walking in the shadow of prehistoric time. Of these, the mysterious
Swastika is perhaps the oldest, as it is certainly the most widely
distributed over the earth. As much a talisman as a symbol, it has been
found on Chaldean bricks, among the ruins of the city of Troy, in Egypt,
on vases of ancient Cyprus, on Hittite remains and the pottery of the
Etruscans, in the cave temples of India, on Roman altars and Runic
monuments in Britain, in Thibet, China, and Korea, in Mexico, Peru, and
among the prehistoric burial-grounds of North America. There have been
many interpretations of it. Perhaps the meaning, most usually assigned
to it is that of the Sanskrit

<span id="page_24">p. 24</span>

word having in its roots an intimation of the beneficence of life, *to
be* and *well*. As such, it is a sign indicating "that the maze of life
may bewilder, but a path of light runs through it: *It is well* is the
name of the path, and the key to life eternal is in the strange
labyrinth for those whom God leadeth." <span
id="fr_10"></span>[1](#fn_10.md) Others hold it to have been an emblem of
the Pole Star whose stability in the sky, and the procession of the Ursa
Major around it, so impressed the ancient world. Men saw the sun
journeying across the heavens every day in a slightly different track,
then standing still, as it were, at the solstice, and then returning on
its way back. They saw the moon changing not only its orbit, but its
size and shape and time of appearing. Only the Pole Star remained fixed
and stable, and it became, not unnaturally, a light of assurance and the
footstool of the Most High. <span id="fr_11"></span>[2](#fn_11.md) Whatever
its meaning, the Swastika shows us the efforts of the early man to read
the riddle of things, and his intuition of a love at the heart of life.

Akin to the Swastika, if not an evolution from it, was the Cross, made
forever holy by the highest

<span id="page_25">p. 25</span>

heroism of Love. When man climbed up out of the primeval night, with his
face to heaven upturned, he had a cross in his hand. Where he got it,
why he held it, and what he meant by it, no one can conjecture much less
affirm. <span id="fr_12"></span>[1](#fn_12.md) Itself a paradox, its arms
pointing to the four quarters of the earth, it is found in almost every
part of the world carved on coins, altars, and tombs, and furnishing a
design for temple architecture in Mexico and Peru, in the pagodas of
India, not less than in the churches of Christ. Ages before our era,
even from the remote time of the cliff-dweller, the Cross seems to have
been a symbol of life, though for what reason no one knows. More often
it was an emblem of eternal life, especially when inclosed within a
Circle which ends not, nor begins—the type of Eternity. Hence the Ank
Cross or Crux Ansata of Egypt, scepter of the Lord of the Dead that
never die. There is less mystery about the Circle, which was an image of
the disk of the Sun and a natural symbol of completeness, of eternity.
With a point within the center it became, as naturally, the emblem of
the Eye of the World—that All-seeing eye of the eternal Watcher of the
human scene.

Square, triangle, cross, circle—oldest symbols of humanity, all of them
eloquent, each of them

<span id="page_26">p. 26</span>

pointing beyond itself, as symbols always do, while giving form to the
invisible truth which they invoke and seek to embody. They are beautiful
if we have eyes to see, serving not merely as chance figures of fancy,
but as forms of reality as it revealed itself to the mind of man.
Sometimes we find them united, the Square within the Circle, and within
that the Triangle, and at the center the Cross. Earliest of emblems,
they show us hints and foregleams of the highest faith and philosophy,
betraying not only the unity of the human mind but its kinship with the
Eternal—the fact which lies at the root of every religion, and is the
basis of each. Upon this Faith man builded, finding a rock beneath,
refusing to think of Death as the gigantic coffin-lid of a dull and
mindless universe descending upon him at last.

#### II

From this brief outlook upon a wide field, we may pass to a more
specific and detailed study of the early prophecies of Masonry in the
art of the builder. Always the symbolic must follow the actual, if it is
to have reference and meaning, and the real is ever the basis of the
ideal. By nature an Idealist, and living in a world of radiant mystery,
it was inevitable that man should attach moral and spiritual meanings to
the tools, laws, and materials

<span id="page_27">p. 27</span>

of building. Even so, in almost every land and in the remotest ages we
find great and beautiful truth hovering about the builder and clinging
to his tools. <span id="fr_13"></span>[1](#fn_13.md) Whether there were
organized orders of builders in the early times no one can tell, though
there may have been. No matter; man mixed thought and worship with his
work, and as he cut his altar stones and fitted them together he thought
out a faith by which to live.

Not unnaturally, in times when the earth was thought to be a Square the
Cube had emblematical meanings it could hardly have for us. From
earliest ages it was a venerated symbol, and the oblong cube signified
immensity of space from the base of earth to the zenith of the heavens.
It was a sacred emblem of the Lydian Kubele, known to the Romans in
after ages as Ceres or Cybele—hence, as some

<span id="page_28">p. 28</span>

aver, the derivation of the word "cube." At first rough stones were most
sacred, and an altar of hewn stones was forbidden. <span
id="fr_14"></span>[1](#fn_14.md) With the advent of the cut cube, the
temple became known as the House of the Hammer—its altar, always in the
center, being in the form of a cube and regarded as "an index or emblem
of Truth, ever true to itself." <span id="fr_15"></span>[2](#fn_15.md)
Indeed, the cube, as Plutarch points out in his essay *On the Cessation
of Oracles*, "is palpably the proper emblem of rest, on account of the
security and firmness of the superficies." He further tells us that the
pyramid is an image of the triangular flame ascending from a square
altar; and since no one knows, his guess is as good as any. At any rate,
Mercury, Apollo, Neptune, and Hercules were worshiped under the form of
a square stone, while a large black stone was the emblem of Buddha among
the Hindoos, of Manah Theus-Ceres in Arabia, and of Odin in Scandinavia.
Everyone knows of the Stone of Memnon in Egypt, which was said to speak
at sun-rise—as, in truth, all stones spoke to man in the sunrise of
time. <span id="fr_16"></span>[3](#fn_16.md)

More eloquent, if possible, was the Pillar uplifted, like the pillars of
the gods upholding the heavens. Whatever may have been the origin of
pillars, and

<span id="page_29">p. 29</span>

there is more than one theory, Evans has shown that they were everywhere
worshiped as gods. <span id="fr_17"></span>[1](#fn_17.md) Indeed, the gods
themselves were pillars of Light and Power, as in Egypt Horus and Sut
were the twin-builders and supporters of heaven; and Bacchus among the
Thebans. At the entrance of the temple of Amenta, at the door of the
house of Ptah—as, later, in the porch of the temple of Solomon—stood two
pillars. Still further back, in the old solar myths, at the gateway of
eternity stood two pillars—Strength and Wisdom. In India, and among the
Mayas and Incas, there were three pillars at the portals of the earthly
and skyey temple—Wisdom, Strength, and Beauty. When man set up a pillar,
he became a fellow-worker with Him whom the old sages of China used to
call "the first Builder." Also, pillars were set up to mark the holy
places of vision and Divine deliverance, as when Jacob erected a pillar
at Bethel, Joshua at Gilgal, and Samuel at Mizpeh and Shen. Always they
were symbols of stability, of what the Egyptians described as "the place
of establishing forever,"—emblems of the faith "that the pillars of the
earth are the Lord's, and He hath set the world upon them." <span
id="fr_18"></span>[2](#fn_18.md)

Long before our era we find the working tools of the Mason used as
emblems of the very truths which they teach today. In the oldest classic
of China,

<span id="page_30">p. 30</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> *The Book of
History*, dating back to the twentieth century before Christ, we read
the instruction: "Ye officers of the Government, apply the compasses."
Even if we begin where *The Book of History* ends, we find many such
allusions more than seven hundred years before the Christian era. For
example, in the famous canonical work, called *The Great Learning*,
which has been referred to the fifth century B. C., we read, that a man
should abstain from doing unto others what he would not they should do
to him; "and this," the writer adds, "is called the principle of acting
on the square." So also Confucius and his great follower, Mencius. In
the writings of Mencius it is taught that men should apply the square
and compasses morally to their lives, and the level and the marking line
besides, if they would walk in the straight and even paths of wisdom,
and keep themselves within the bounds of honor and virtue. <span
id="fr_19"></span>[1](#fn_19.md) In the sixth book of his philosophy we
find these words:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">A Master Mason, in teaching apprentices, makes use
of the compasses and the square. Ye who are engaged in the pursuit of
wisdom must also make use of the compass and square. <span
id="fr_20"></span>[2](#fn_20.md)</span>

</div>

There are even evidences, in the earliest historic

<span id="page_31">p. 31</span>

records of China, of the existence of a system of faith expressed in
allegoric form, and illustrated by the symbols of building. The secrets
of this faith seem to have been orally transmitted, the leaders alone
pretending to have full knowledge of them. Oddly enough, it seems to
have gathered about a symbolical temple put up in the desert, that the
various officers of the faith were distinguished by symbolic jewels, and
that at its rites they wore leather aprons. <span
id="fr_21"></span>[1](#fn_21.md) From such records as we have it is not
possible to say whether the builders themselves used their tools as
emblems, or whether it was the thinkers who first used them to teach
moral truths. In any case, they were understood; and the point here is
that, thus early, the tools of the builder were teachers of wise and
good and beautiful truth. Indeed, we need not go outside the Bible to
find both the materials and working tools of the Mason so
employed: <span id="fr_22"></span>[2](#fn_22.md)

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">For every house is builded by some man; but the
builder of all things is God . . . whose house we are. <span

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Behold, I lay in Zion for a foundation a tried stone, a precious
corner-stone, a sure foundation. <span id="fr_24"></span>[1](#fn_24.md)

</div>

<span id="page_33">p. 33</span>

If further proof were needed, it has been preserved for us in the
imperishable stones of Egypt. <span id="fr_33"></span>[1](#fn_33.md) The
famous obelisk, known as Cleopatra's Needle, now in Central Park, New
York, the gift to our nation from Ismail, Khedive of Egypt in 1878, is a
mute but eloquent witness of the antiquity of the simple symbols of the
Mason. Originally it stood as one of the forest of obelisks surrounding
the great temple of the Sun-god at Heliopolis, so long a seat of
Egyptian learning and religion, dating back, it is thought, to the
fifteenth century before Christ. It was removed to Alexandria and
re-erected by a Roman architect and engineer named Pontius, B. C. 22.
When it was taken down in 1879 to be brought to America, all the emblems
of the builders were found in the foundation. The rough Cube and the
polished Cube in pure white limestone, the Square cut in syenite, an
iron Trowel, a lead Plummet, the arc of a Circle, the serpent-symbols of
Wisdom, a stone Trestle-board, a stone bearing the Master's Mark, and a
hieroglyphic word meaning *Temple*—all so placed and preserved as to
show, beyond doubt, that they had high symbolic meaning.

<span id="page_34">p. 34</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Whether they were
in the original foundation, or were placed there when the obelisk was
removed, no one can tell. Nevertheless, they were there, concrete
witnesses of the fact that the builders worked in the light of a
mystical faith, of which they were emblems.

Much has been written of buildings, their origin, age, and architecture,
but of the builders hardly a word—so quickly is the worker forgotten,
save as he lives in his work. Though we have no records other than these
emblems, it is an obvious inference that there were orders of builders
even in those early ages, to whom these symbols were sacred; and this
inference is the more plausible when we remember the importance of the
builder both to religion and the state. What though the builders have
fallen into dust, to which all things mortal decline, they still hold
out their symbols for us to read, speaking their thoughts in a language
easy to understand. Across the piled-up debris of ages they whisper the
old familiar truths, and it will be a part of this study to trace those
symbols through the centuries, showing that they have always had the
same high meanings. They bear witness not only to the unity of the human
mind, but to the existence of a common system of truth veiled in
allegory and taught in symbols. As such, they are prophecies of Masonry
as

<span id="page_35">p. 35</span>

we know it, whose genius it is to take what is old, simple, and
universal, and use it to bring men together and make them friends.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_9"></span>[20:1](bui04.htm#fr_9.md) There are many books in
this field, but two may be named: *The Lost Language of Symbolism*, by
Bayley, and the *Signs and Symbols of Primordial Man*, by Churchward,
each in its own way remarkable. The first aspires to be for this field
what Frazer's *Golden Bough* is for religious anthropology, and its
dictum is: "Beauty is Truth; Truth Beauty." The thesis of the second is
that Masonry is founded upon Egyptian eschatology, which may be true;
but unfortunately the book is too polemical. Both books par take of the
poetry, if not the confusion, of the subject; but not for <span
id="page_21">p. 21</span> a world of dust would one clip their wings of
fancy and suggestion. Indeed, their union of scholarship and poetry is
unique. When the pains of erudition fail to track a fact to its lair,
they do not scruple to use the divining rod; and the result often passes
out of the realm of pedestrian chronicle into the world of winged
literature.

<span id="fn_10"></span>[24:1](bui04.htm#fr_10.md) *The Word in the

Churchward, chap. xvii.

<span id="fn_13"></span>[27:1](bui04.htm#fr_13.md) Here again the
literature is voluminous, but not entirely satisfactory. A most
interesting book is *Signs and Symbols of Primordial Man*, by
Churchward, in that it surveys the symbolism of the race always with
reference to its Masonic suggestion. Vivid and popular is *Symbols and
Legends of Freemasonry*, by Finlayson, but he often strains facts in
order to stretch them over wide gaps of time. Dr. Mackey's *Symbolism of
Freemasonry*, though written more than sixty years ago, remains a
classic of the order. Unfortunately the lectures of Albert Pike on
*Symbolism* are not accessible to the general reader, for they are rich
mines of insight and scholarship, albeit betraying his partisanship of
the Indo-Aryan race. Many .minor books might be named, but we need a
work brought up to date and written in the light of recent research.
