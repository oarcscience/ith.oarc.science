# PART II—HISTORY

<span id="page_96">p. 96</span>

*The curious history of Freemasonry has unfortunately been treated only
by its panegyrists or calumniators, both equally mendacious. I do. not
wish to pry into the mysteries of the craft; but it would be interesting
to know more of their history during the period when they were literally
architects. They are charged by an act of Parliament with fixing the
price of their labor in their annual chapters, contrary to the statute
of laborers, and such chapters were consequently prohibited. This is
their first persecution; they have since undergone others, and are
perhaps reserved for still more. It is remarkable, that Masons were
never legally incorporated, like other traders; their bond of union
being stronger than any charter*.

### CHAPTER I

### Free-Masons

#### I

FROM the foregoing pages it must be evident that Masonry, as we find it
in the Middle Ages, was not a novelty. Already, if we accept its own
records, it was hoary with age, having come down from a far past,
bringing with it a remarkable deposit of legendary lore. Also, it had in
its keeping the same simple, eloquent emblems which, as we have seen,
are older than the oldest living religion, which it received as an
inheritance and has transmitted as a treasure. Whatever we may think of
the legends of Masonry, as recited in its oldest documents, its symbols,
older than the order itself, link it with the earliest thought and faith
of the race. No doubt those emblems lost some of their luster in the
troublous time of transition we are about to traverse, but their beauty
never wholly faded, and they had only to be touched to shine.

If not the actual successors of the Roman College of Architects, the
great order of Comacine Masters was founded upon its ruins, and
continued its tradition

<span id="page_98">p. 98</span>

both of [symbolism](errata.htm#3.md) and of art. Returning to Rome after
the death of Diocletian, we find them busy there under Constantine and
Theodosius; and from remains recently brought to knowledge it is plain
that their style of building at that time was very like that of the
churches built at Hexham and York in England, and those of the Ravenna,
also nearly contemporary. They may not have been actually called
Free-masons as early as Leader Scott insists they were, <span
id="fr_64"></span>[1](#fn_64.md) but they were free in fact, traveling far
and near where there was work to do, following the missionaries of the
Church as far as England. When there was need for the name Free-masons,
it was easily suggested by the fact that the cathedral-builders were
quite distinct from the Guild-masons, the one being a universal order
whereas the other was local and restricted. Older than Guild-masonry,
the order of the cathedral-builders was more powerful, more artistic,
and, it may be added, more religious; and it is from this order that the
Masonry of today is descended.

Since the story of the Comacine Masters has come to light, no doubt any
longer remains that during the building period the order of Masons was
at the height of its influence and power. At that time the building art
stood above all other arts, and made the other arts bow to it,
commanding the services of the

<span id="page_99">p. 99</span>

most brilliant intellects and of the greatest artists of the age.
Moreover, its symbols were wrought into stone long before they were
written on parchment, if indeed they were ever recorded at all. Efforts
have been made to rob those old masters of their honor as the designers
of the cathedrals, but it is in vain. <span
id="fr_65"></span>[1](#fn_65.md) Their monuments are enduring and still
tell the story of their genius and art. High upon the cathedrals they
left cartoons in stone, of which Findel gives a list, <span
id="fr_66"></span>[2](#fn_66.md) portraying with searching

<span id="page_100">p. 100</span>

satire abuses current in the Church. Such figures and devices would not
have been tolerated but for the strength of the order, and not even then
had the Church known what they meant to the adepts.

History, like a mirage, lifts only a part of the past into view, leaving
much that we should like to know in oblivion. At this distance the
Middle Ages wear an aspect of smooth uniformity of faith and opinion,
but that is only one of the many illusions of time by which we are
deceived. What looks like uniformity was only conformity, and underneath
its surface there was almost as much variety of thought as there is
today, albeit not so freely expressed. Science itself, as well as
religious ideas deemed heretical, sought seclusion; but the human mind
was alive and active none the less, and a great secret Order like
Masonry, enjoying the protection of the Church, yet independent of it,
invited freedom of thought and faith. <span
id="fr_67"></span>[1](#fn_67.md) The Masons, by the very nature of their
art, came into contact with all classes of men, and they had
opportunities to know the defects

<span id="page_101">p. 101</span>

of the Church. Far ahead of the masses and most of the clergy in
education, in their travels to and fro, not only in Europe, but often
extending to the far East, they became familiar with widely-differing
religious views. They had learned to practice toleration, and their
Lodges became a sure refuge for those who were persecuted for the sake
of opinion by bigoted fanaticism.

While, as an order, the Comacine Masters served the Church as builders,
the creed required for admission to their fraternity was never narrow,
and, as we shall see, it became every year broader. Unless this fact be
kept in mind, the influence of the Church upon Masonry, which no one
seeks to minify, may easily be exaggerated. Not until cathedral building
began to decline by reason of the impoverishment of the nations by long
wars, the dissolution of the monasteries, and the advent of Puritanism,
did the Church greatly influence the order; and not even then to the
extent of diverting it from its original and unique mission. Other
influences were at work betimes, such as the persecution of the Knights
Templars and the tragic martyrdom of De Molai, making themselves
felt, <span id="fr_68"></span>[1](#fn_68.md) and Masonry began to be
suspected of harboring heresy. So tangled were the

<span id="page_102">p. 102</span>

tendencies of that period that they are not easily followed, but the
fact emerges that Masonry rapidly broadened until its final break with
the Church. Hardly more than a veneer, by the time of the German
Reformation almost every vestige of the impress of the Church had
vanished never to return. Critics of the order have been at pains to
trace this tendency, not knowing, apparently, that by so doing they only
make more emphatic the chief glory of Masonry.

#### II

Unfortunately, as so often happens, no records of old Craft-masonry,
save those wrought into stone, were made until the movement had begun to
decline; and for that reason such documents as have come down to us do
not show it at its best. Nevertheless, they range over a period of more
than four centuries, and are justly held to be the title deeds of the
Order. Turning to these *Old Charges* 

<span id="page_103">p. 103</span>

and *Constitutions*, <span id="fr_69"></span>[1](#fn_69.md) as they are
called, we find a body of quaint and curious writing, both in poetry and
prose, describing the Masonry of the late cathedral-building period,
with glimpses at least of greater days of old. Of these, there are more
than half a hundred—seventy-eight, to be exact—most of which have come
to light since 1860, and all of them, it would seem, copies of documents
still older. Naturally they have suffered at the hands of unskilled or
unlearned copyists, as is evident from errors, embellishments, and
interpolations. They were called *Old Charges* because they contained
certain rules as to conduct and duties which, in a bygone time, were
read or recited to a newly admitted member of the craft. While they
differ somewhat in details, they relate substantially the same legend as
to the origin of the order, its early history, its laws and regulations,
usually beginning with an invocation and ending with an Amen.

<span id="page_104">p. 104</span>

Only a brief account need here be given of the dates and characteristics
of these documents, of the two oldest especially, with a digest of what
they have to tell us, first, of the Legend of the order; second, its
early History; and third, its Moral teaching, its workings, and the
duties of its members. The first and oldest of the records is known as
the *Regius MS* which, owing to an error of David Casley who in his
catalogue of the MSS in the King's Library marked it *A Poem of Moral
Duties*, was overlooked until James Halliwell discovered its real nature
in 1839. Although not a Mason, Halliwell was attracted by the MS and
read an essay on its contents before the Society of Antiquarians, after
which he issued two editions bearing date of 1840 and 1844. Experts give
it date back to 1390, that is to say, fifteen years after the first
recorded use of the name *Free*-mason in the history of the Company of
Masons of the City of London, in 1375. <span
id="fr_70"></span>[1](#fn_70.md)

More poetical in spirit than in form, the old manuscript begins by
telling of the number of unemployed in early days and the necessity of
finding

<span id="page_105">p. 105</span>

work, "that they myght gete there lyvyngs therby." Euclid was consulted,
and recommended the "onest craft of good masonry," and the origin of the
order is found "yn Egypte lande." Then, by a quick shift, we are landed
in England "yn tyme of good Kinge Adelstonus day," who is said to have
called an assembly of Masons, when fifteen articles and as many points
were agreed upon as rules of the craft, each point being duly described.
The rules resemble the Ten Commandments in an extended form, closing
with the legend of the Four Crowned Martyrs, as an incentive to
fidelity. Then the writer takes up again the question of origins, going
back this time to the days of Noah and the Flood, mentioning the tower
of Babylon and the great skill of Euclid, who is said to have commenced
"the syens seven." The seven sciences are then named, to-wit, Grammar,
Logic, Rhetoric, Music, Astronomy, Arithmetic, Geometry, and each
explained. Rich reward is held out to those who use the seven sciences
aright, and the MS proper closes with the benediction:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Amen! Amen! so mote it be!  
So say we all for Charity.</span>

</div>

There follows a kind of appendix, evidently added by a priest,
consisting of one hundred lines in which pious exhortation is mixed with
instruction in etiquette, such as lads and even men unaccustomed to

<span id="page_106">p. 106</span>

polite society and correct deportment would need. These lines were in
great part extracted from Instructions for Parish Priests, by Mirk, a
manual in use at the time. The whole poem, if so it may be called, is
imbued with the spirit of freedom, of gladness, of social good will; so
much so, that both Gould and Albert Pike think it points to the
existence of symbolic Masonry at the date from which it speaks, and may
have been recited or sung by some club commemorating the science, but
not practicing the art, of Masonry. They would find intimation of the
independent existence of speculative Masonry thus early, in a society
from whom all but the memory or tradition of its ancient craft had
departed. One hesitates to differ with writers so able and
distinguished, yet this inference seems far-fetched, if not forced. Of
the existence of symbolic Masonry at that time there is no doubt, but of
its independent existence it is not easy to find even a hint in this old
poem. Nor would the poem be suitable for a mere social, or even a
symbolic guild, whereas the spirit of genial, joyous comradeship which
breathes through it is of the very essence of Masonry, and has ever been
present when Masons meet.

Next in order of age is the *Cooke MS*, dating from the early part of
the fifteenth century, and first published in 1861. If we apply the laws
of higher-criticism

<span id="page_107">p. 107</span>

to this old document a number of things appear, as obvious as they are
interesting. Not only is it a copy of an older record, like all the MSS
we have, but it is either an effort to join two documents together, or
else the first part must be regarded as a long preamble to the
manuscript which forms the second part. For the two are quite unlike in
method and style, the first being diffuse, with copious quotations and
references to authorities, <span id="fr_71"></span>[1](#fn_71.md) while the
second is simple, direct, unadorned, and does not even allude to the
Bible. Also, it is evident that the compiler, himself a Mason, is trying
to harmonize two traditions as to the origin of the order, one tracing
it through Egypt and the other through the Hebrews; and it is hard to
tell which tradition he favors most. Hence a duplication of the
traditional history, and an odd mixture of names and dates, often,
indeed, absurd, as when he makes Euclid a pupil of Abraham. What is
clear is that, having found an old Constitution of the Craft, he thought
to write a kind of commentary upon it, adding proofs and illustrations
of his own, though he did not manage his materials very successfully.

<span id="page_108">p. 108</span>

After his invocation, <span id="fr_72"></span>[1](#fn_72.md) the writer
begins with a list of the Seven Sciences, giving quaint definitions of
each, but in a different order from that recited in the *Regius Poem*;
and he exalts Geometry above all the rest as "the first cause and
foundation of all crafts and sciences." Then follows a brief sketch of
the sons of Lamech, much as we find it in the book of Genesis which,
like the old MS we are here studying, was compiled from two older
records: the one tracing the descent from Cain, and the other from Seth.
Jabal and Jubal, we are told, inscribed their knowledge of science and
handicraft on two pillars, one of marble, the other of lateres; and
after the flood one of the pillars was found by Hermes, and the other by
Pythagoras, who taught the sciences they found written thereon. Other
MSS give Euclid the part here assigned to Hermes. Surely this is all
fantastic enough, but the blending of the names of Hermes, the "father
of Wisdom," who is so supreme a figure in the Egyptian Mysteries, and
Pythagoras who used numbers as spiritual emblems, with old Hebrew
history, is significant. At

<span id="page_109">p. 109</span>

any rate, by this route the record reaches Egypt where, like the *Regius
Poem*, it locates the origin of Masonry. In thus ascribing the origin of
Geometry to the Egyptians the writer was but following a tradition that
the Egyptians were compelled to invent it in order to restore the
landmarks effaced by the inundations of the Nile; a tradition confirmed
by modern research.

[Proceeding](errata.htm#4.md), the compiler tells us that during their
sojourn in Egypt the Hebrews learned the art and secrets of Masonry,
which they took with them to the promised land. Long years are rapidly
sketched, and we come to the days of David, who is said to have loved
Masons well, and to have given them "wages nearly as they are now."
There is but a meager reference to the building of the Temple of
Solomon, to which is added: "In other chronicles and old books of
Masonry, it is said that Solomon confirmed the charges that David had
given to Masons; and that Solomon taught them their usages differing but
slightly from the customs now in use." While allusion is made to the
master-artist of the temple, his name is not mentioned, *except in
disguise*. Not one of the *Old Charges* of the order ever makes use of
his name, but always employs some device whereby to conceal it. <span
id="fr_73"></span>[1](#fn_73.md) Why so, when the

<span id="page_110">p. 110</span>

name was well known, written in the Bible which lay upon the altar for
all to read? Why such reluctance, if it be not that the name and the
legend linked with it had an esoteric meaning, as it most certainly did
have long before it was wrought into a drama? At this point the writer
drops the old legend and traces the Masons into France and England,
after the manner of the *Regius MS*, but with more detail. Having noted
these items, he returns to Euclid and brings that phase of the tradition
up to the advent of the order into England, adding, in conclusion, the
articles of Masonic law agreed upon at an early assembly, of which he
names nine, instead of the fifteen recited in the *Regius Poem*.

What shall we say of this Legend, with its recurring and insistent
emphasis upon the antiquity of the order, and its linking of Egypt with
Israel? For one thing, it explodes the fancy that the idea of the
symbolical significance of the building of the Temple of Solomon
originated with, or was suggested by, Bacon's *New Atlantis*. Here is a
body of tradition uniting the Egyptian Mysteries with the Hebrew history
of the Temple in a manner unmistakable. Wherefore such names as Hermes,
Pythagoras,

<span id="page_111">p. 111</span>

and Euclid, and how did they come into the old craft records if not
through the Comacine artists and scholars? With the story of that great
order before us, much that has hitherto been obscure becomes plain, and
we recognize in these *Old Charges* the inaccurate and perhaps faded
tradition of a lofty symbolism, an authentic scholarship, and an actual
history. As Leader Scott observes, after reciting the old legend in its
crudest form:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">*The significant point is that all these names and
Masonic emblems point to something real which existed in some long-past
time, and, as regards the organization and nomenclature, we find the
whole thing in its vital and actual working form in the Comacine
Guild*. <span id="fr_74"></span>[1](#fn_74.md)</span>

</div>

Of interest here, as a kind of bridge between old legend and the early
history of the order in England, and also as a different version of the
legend itself, is another document dating far back. There was a MS
discovered in the Bodleian Library at Oxford about 1696, supposed to
have been written in the year 1436, which purports to be an examination
of a Mason by King Henry VI, and is allowed by all to be genuine. Its
title runs as follows: "*Certain questions with answers to the same
concerning the mystery of masonry written by King Henry the Sixth and
faithfully copied by me, John* 

<span id="page_112">p. 112</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> *Laylande,
antiquarian, by command of his highness*." Written in quaint old
English, it would doubtless be unintelligible to all but antiquarians,
but it reads after this fashion:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

What mote it be?—It is the knowledge of nature, and the power of its
various operations; particularly the skill of reckoning, of weights and
measures, of constructing buildings and dwellings of all kinds, and the
true manner of forming all things for the use of man.

Where did it begin?—It began with the first men of the East, who were
before the first men of the West, and coming with it, it hath brought
all comforts to the wild and comfortless.

Who brought it to the West?—The Phoenicians who, being great merchants,
came first from the East into Phoenicia, for the convenience of
commerce, both East and West by the Red and Mediterranean Seas.

How came it into England?—Pythagoras, a Grecian, traveled to acquire
knowledge in Egypt and Syria, and in every other land where the
Phoenicians had planted Masonry; and gaining admittance into all lodges
of Masons, he learned much, and returned and dwelt in Grecia Magna,
growing and becoming mighty wise and greatly renowned. Here he formed a
great lodge at Crotona, and made many Masons, some of whom traveled into
France, and there made many more, from whence, in process of time, the
art passed into England.

</div>

#### III

With the conquest of Britain by the Romans, the *Collegia*, without
which no Roman society was complete,

<span id="page_113">p. 113</span>

made their advent into the island, traces of their work remaining even
to this day. Under the direction of the mother College at Rome, the
Britons are said to have attained to high degree of excellence as
builders, so that when the cities of Gaul and the fortresses along the
Rhine were destroyed, Chlorus, A. D. 298, sent to Britain for architects
to repair or rebuild them. Whether the *Collegia* existed in Britain
after the Romans left, as some affirm, or were suppressed, as we know
they were on the Continent when the barbarians overran it, is not clear.
Probably they were destroyed, or nearly so, for with the revival of
Christianity in 598 A. D., we find Bishop Wilfred of York joining with
the Abbott of Wearmouth in sending to France and Italy to induce Masons
to return and build in stone, as he put it, "after the Roman manner."
This confirms the Italian chroniclists who relate that Pope Gregory sent
several of the fraternity of *Liberi muratori* with St. Augustine, as,
later, they followed St. Boniface into Germany.

Again, in 604, Augustine sent the monk Pietro back to Rome with a letter
to the same Pontiff, begging him to send more architects and workmen,
which he did. As the *Liberi muratori* were none other than the Comacine
Masters, it seems certain that they were at work in England *long before
the period with which the* OLD CHARGES *begin their* 

<span id="page_114">p. 114</span>

*story of English Masonry*. <span id="fr_75"></span>[1](#fn_75.md) Among
those sent by Gregory was Paulinus, and it is a curious fact that he is
spoken of under the title of *Magister*, by which is meant, no doubt,
that he was a member of the Comacine order, for they so described their
members; and we know that many monks were enrolled in their lodges,
having studied the art of building under their instruction. St. Hugh of
Lincoln was not the only Bishop who could plan a church, instruct the
workman, or handle a hod. Only, it must be kept in mind that these
ecclesiastics who became skilled in architecture *were taught by the
Masons*, and that it was not the monks, as some seem to imagine, who
taught the Masons their art. Speaking of this early and troublous time,
Giuseppe Merzaria says that only one lamp remained alight, making a
bright spark in the darkness that extended over Europe:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">It was from the *Magistri Comacini*. Their
respective names are unknown, their individual works unspecialized, but
the breadth of their spirit might be felt all through those centuries,
and their name collectively is legion. We may safely say that of all the
works of art between <span id="page_115">p. 115</span> A. D. 800 and
1000, the greater and better part are due to that brotherhood—always
faithful and often secret—of the *Magistri Comacini*. The authority and
judgment of learned men justify the assertion. <span
id="fr_76"></span>[1](#fn_76.md)</span>

</div>

Among the learned men who agree with this judgment are Kugler of
Germany, Ramee of France, and Selvatico of Italy, as well as Quatremal
de Quincy, in his *Dictionary of Architecture*, who, in the article on
the Comacine, remarks that "to these men, who were both designers and
executors, architects, sculptors, and mosaicists, may be attributed the
renaissance of art, and its propagation in the southern countries, where
it marched with Christianity. Certain it is that we owe it to them, that
the heritage of antique ages was not entirely lost, and it is only by
their tradition and imitation that the art of building was kept alive,
producing works which we still admire, and which become surprising when
we think of the utter ignorance of all science in those dark ages." The
English writer, Hope, goes further and credits the Comacine order with
being the cradle of the associations of Free-masons, who were, he adds,
"the first after Roman times to enrich architecture with a complete and
well-ordinated system, which dominated wherever the Latin Church
extended its influence." <span id="fr_77"></span>[2](#fn_77.md) So

<span id="page_116">p. 116</span>

then, even if the early records of old Craft-masonry in England are
confused, and often confusing, we are not left to grope our way from one
dim tradition to another, having the history and monuments of this great
order which *spans the whole period*, and links the fraternity of
Free-masons with one of the noblest chapters in the annals of art.

Almost without exception the *Old Charges* begin their account of
Masonry in England at the time of Athelstan, the grandson of Alfred the
Great; that is, between 925 and 940. Of this prince, or knight, they
record that he was a wise and pacific ruler; that "he brought the land
to rest and peace, and built many great buildings of castles and abbeys,
for he loved Masons well." He is also said to have called an assembly of
Masons at which laws, rules, and charges were adopted for the regulation
of the craft. Despite these specific details, the story of Athelstan and
St. Alban is hardly more than a legend, albeit dating at no very remote
epoch, and well within the reasonable limits of tradition. Still, so
many difficulties beset it that it has baffled the acutest critics, most
of whom throw it aside. <span id="fr_78"></span>[1](#fn_78.md) That

<span id="page_117">p. 117</span>

is, however, too summary a way of disposing of it, since the record,
though badly blurred, is obviously trying to preserve a fact of
importance to the order.

Usually the assembly in question is located at York, in the year 926, of
which, however, no slightest record remains. Whether at York or
elsewhere, some such assembly must have been convoked, either as a civil
function, or as a regular meeting of Masons authorized by legal power
for upholding the honor of the craft; and its articles became the laws
of the order. It was probably a civil assembly, a part of whose
legislation was a revised and approved code for the regulation of
Masons, and not unnaturally, by reason of its importance to the order,
it became known as a Masonic assembly. Moreover, the Charge agreed upon
was evidently no ordinary charge, for it is spoken of as "*the* Charge,"
called by one MS "a deep charge for the observation of such articles as
belong to Masonry," and by another MS "a rule to be kept forever."

<span id="page_118">p. 118</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Other assemblies
were held afterwards, either annually or semi-annually, until the time
of Inigo Jones who, in 1607, became superintendent general of royal
buildings and at the same time head of the Masonic order in England; and
he it was who instituted quarterly gatherings instead of the old annual
assemblies.

Writers not familiar with the facts often speak of Freemasonry as an
evolution from Guild-masonry, but that is to err. They were never at any
time united or the same, though working almost side by side through
several centuries. Free-masons existed in large numbers long before any
city guild of Masons was formed, and even after the Guilds became
powerful the two were entirely distinct. The Guilds, as Hallam
says, <span id="fr_79"></span>[1](#fn_79.md) "were Fraternities by
voluntary compact, to relieve each other in poverty, and to protect each
other from injury. Two essential

<span id="page_119">p. 119</span>

characteristics belonged to them: the common banquet, and the common
purse. They had also, in many instances, a religious and sometimes a
secret ceremonial to knit more firmly the bond of fidelity. They readily
became connected with the exercises of trades, with training of
apprentices, and the traditional rules of art." Guild-masons, it may be
added, had many privileges, one of which was that they were allowed to
frame their own laws, and to enforce obedience thereto. Each Guild had a
monopoly of the building in its city or town, except ecclesiastical
buildings, but with this went serious restrictions and limitations. No
member of a local Guild could undertake work outside his town, but had
to hold himself in readiness to repair the castle or town walls, whereas
Free-masons journeyed the length and breadth of the land wherever their
labor called them. Often the Free-masons, when at work in a town,
employed Guild-masons, but only for rough work, and as such called them
"rough-masons." No Guild-mason was admitted to the order of Free-masons
unless he displayed unusual aptitude both as a workman and as a man of
intellect. Such as adhered only to the manual craft

<span id="page_120">p. 120</span>

and cared nothing for intellectual aims, were permitted to go back to
the Guilds. For the Free-masons, be it once more noted, were not only
artists doing a more difficult and finished kind of work, but an
intellectual order, having a great tradition of science and symbolism
which they guarded.

Following the Norman Conquest, which began in 1066, England was invaded
by an army of ecclesiastics, and churches, monasteries, cathedrals, and
abbeys were commenced in every part of the country. Naturally the
Free-masons were much in demand, and some of them received rich reward
for their skill as architects—Robertus Cementarius, a Master Mason
employed at St. Albans in 1077, receiving a grant of land and a house in
the town. <span id="fr_80"></span>[1](#fn_80.md) In the reign of Henry II
no less than one hundred and fifty-seven religious buildings were
founded in England, and it is at this period that we begin to see
evidence of a new style of architecture—the Gothic. Most of the great
cathedrals of Europe date from the eleventh century—the piety of the
world having been wrought to a pitch of intense excitement by the
expected end of all things, unaccountably fixed by popular belief to

<span id="page_121">p. 121</span>

year one thousand. When the fatal year—and the following one, which some
held to be the real date for the sounding of the last trumpet—passed
without the arrival of the dreaded catastrophe, the sense of general
relief found expression in raising magnificent temples to the glory of
God who had mercifully abstained from delivering all things to
destruction. And it was the order of Free-masons who made it possible
for men to "sing their souls in stone," leaving for the admiration of
after times what Goethe called the "frozen music" of the Middle
Ages—monuments of the faith and gratitude of the race which adorn and
consecrate the earth.

Little need be added to the story of Freemasonry during the
cathedral-building period; its monuments are its best history, alike of
its genius, its faith, and its symbols—as witness the triangle and the
circle which form the keystone of the ornamental tracery of every Gothic
temple. Masonry was then at the zenith of its power, in its full
splendor, the Lion of the tribe of Judah its symbol, strength, wisdom,
and beauty its ideals; its motto to be faithful to God and the
Government; its mission to lend itself to the public good and fraternal
charity. Keeper of an ancient and high tradition, it was a refuge for
the oppressed, and a teacher of art and morality to mankind. In 1270, we
find

<span id="page_122">p. 122</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Pope Nicholas III
confirming all the rights previously granted to the Free-masons, and
bestowing on them further privileges. Indeed, all the Popes up to
Benedict XII appear to have conceded marked favors to the order, even to
the length of exempting its members from the necessity of observance of
the statutes, from municipal regulations, and from obedience to royal
edicts.

What wonder, then, that the Free-masons, ere long, took *Liberty* for
their motto, and by so doing aroused the animosity of those in
authority, as well as the Church which they had so nobly served. Already
forces were astir which ultimately issued in the Reformation, and it is
not surprising that a great secret order was suspected of harboring men
and fostering influences sympathetic with the impending change felt to
be near at hand. As men of the most diverse views, political and
religious, were in the lodges, the order began first to be accused of
refusing to obey the law, and then to be persecuted. In England a
statute was enacted against the Free-masons in 1356, prohibiting their
assemblies under severe penalties, but the law seems never to have been
rigidly enforced; though the order suffered greatly in the civil
commotions of the period. However, with the return of peace after the
long War of the Roses, Freemasonry revived

<span id="page_123">p. 123</span>

for a time, and regained much of its prestige, adding to its fame in the
rebuilding of London after the fire, and in particular of St. Paul's
Cathedral. <span id="fr_81"></span>[1](#fn_81.md)

When cathedral-building ceased, and the demand for highly skilled
architects decreased, the order fell into decline, but never at any time
lost its identity, its organization, and its ancient emblems. The
Masons' Company of London, though its extant records date only from
1620, is considered by its historian, Conder, to have been established
in 1220, if not earlier, at which time there was great activity in
building, owing to the building of London Bridge, begun in 1176, and of
Westminster Abbey in 1221; thus reaching back into the cathedral period.
At one time the Free-masons seem to have been stronger in Scotland than
in England, or at all events to have left behind more records—for the
minutes of the Lodge of Edinburgh go back to 1599, and the *Schaw
Statutes* to an earlier date.

<span id="page_124">p. 124</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Nevertheless, as
the art of architecture declined Masonry declined with it, not a few of
its members identifying themselves with the Guilds of ordinary
"rough-masons," whom they formerly held in contempt; while others,
losing sight of high aims, turned its lodges into social clubs. Always,
however, despite defection and decline, there were those, as we shall
see, who were faithful to the ideals of the order, devoting themselves
more and more to its moral and spiritual teaching until what has come to
be known as "the revival of 1717."

Builders*, chap. i.

<span id="fn_65"></span>[99:1](bui08.htm#fr_65.md) "The honor due to the
original founders of these edifices is almost invariably transferred to
the ecclesiastics under whose patronage they rose, rather than to the
skill and design of the Master Mason, or professional architect, because
the only historians were monks. . . They were probably not so well
versed in geometrical science as the Master Masons, for mathematics
formed a part of monastic learning in a very limited degree."—James
Dallaway, *Architecture in England*; and his words are the more weighty
for that he is not a Mason.

<span id="fn_66"></span>[99:2](bui08.htm#fr_66.md) *History of Masonry*. In
the St. Sebaldus Church, Nuremburg, is a carving in stone showing a nun
in the embrace of a monk. In Strassburg a hog and a goat may be seen
carrying a sleeping fox as a sacred relic, in advance a bear with a
cross and a wolf with a taper. An ass is reading mass at an altar. In
Wurzburg Cathedral are the pillars of Boaz and Jachin, and in the altar
of the Church of Doberan, in Mecklenburg, placed as Masons use them, and
a most significant scene in which priests are turning a mill grinding
out dogmatic doctrines; and at the bottom the Lord's Supper in which the
Apostles are shown in well-known Masonic attitudes. In the Cathedral of
Brandenburg a fox in priestly robes is preaching to a flock of geese;
and in the Minster at Berne the Pope is placed among those who are lost
in perdition. These were bold strokes which even heretics hardly dared
to indulge in.

<span id="fn_67"></span>[100:1](bui08.htm#fr_67.md) *History of Masonry*,
by Steinbrenner, chap. iv. There were, Indeed, many secret societies in
the Middle Ages, such as the Catharists, Albigenses, Waldenses, and
others, whose initiates and adherents traveled through all Europe,
forming new communities and making proselytes not only among the masses,
but also among nobles, and even among the monks, abbots, and bishops.
Occultists, Alchemists, Kabbalists, all wrought in secrecy, keeping
their flame aglow under the crust of conformity.

<span id="fn_68"></span>[101:1](bui08.htm#fr_68.md) *Realities of Masonry*,
by Blake (chap. ii). While the theory of the descent of Masonry from the
Order of the Temple is untenable, a connection between the two
societies, in the sense in which <span id="page_102">p. 102</span> an
artist may be said to be connected with his employer, is more than
probable; and a similarity may be traced between the ritual of reception
in the Order of the Temple and that used by Masons, but that of the
Temple was probably derived from, or suggested by, that of the Masons;
or both may have come from an original source further back. That the
Order of the Temple, as such, did not actually coalesce with the Masons
seems clear, but many of its members sought refuge under the Masonic
apron (*History of Free-masonry and Concordant Orders*, by Hughan and
Stillson).

<span id="fn_69"></span>[103:1](bui08.htm#fr_69.md) Every elaborate History
of Masonry—as, for example, that of Gould—reproduces these old documents
in full or in digest, with exhaustive analyses of and commentaries upon
them. Such a task obviously does not come within the scope of the
present study. One of the best brief comparative studies of the *Old
Charges* is an essay by W. H. Upton, "The True Text of the *Book of
Constitutions*," in that it applies approved methods of historical
criticism to all of them (*A. Q. C.*, vii, 119). See also *Masonic
Sketches and Reprints*, by Hughan. No doubt these *Old Charges* are
familiar, or should be familiar, to every intelligent member of the
order, as a man knows the deeds of his estate.

<span id="fn_70"></span>[104:1](bui08.htm#fr_70.md) *The Hole Craft and
Fellowship of Masonry*, by Conder. Also exhaustive essays by Conder and
Speth, *A. Q. C.*, ix, 29; x, 10. Too much, it seems to me, has been
made of both the name and the date, since the fact was older than
either. Findel finds the name *Free*-mason as early as 1212, and Leader
Scott goes still further back; but the fact may be traced back to the
Roman Collegia.

<span id="fn_71"></span>[107:1](bui08.htm#fr_71.md) He refers to Herodotus
as the Master of History; quotes from the *Polychronicon*, written by a
Benedictine monk who died in 1360; from *De Imagine Mundi*, Isodorus,
and frequently from the Bible. Of more than ordinary learning for his
day and station, he did not escape a certain air of pedantry in his use
of authorities.

<span id="fn_72"></span>[108:1](bui08.htm#fr_72.md) These invocations vary
in their phraseology, some bearing more visibly than others the mark of
the Church. Toulmin Smith, in his English Guilds, notes the fact that
the form of the invocations of the Masons "differs strikingly from that
of most other Guilds. In almost every other case, God the Father
Almighty would seem to have been forgotten." But Masons never forgot the
corner-stone upon which their order and its teachings rest; not for a
day.

<span id="fn_73"></span>[109:1](bui08.htm#fr_73.md) Such names as Aynone,
Aymon, Ajuon, Dynon, Amon, Anon, Annon, and Benaim are used,
deliberately, it would seem, and of <span id="page_110">p. 110</span>
set design. The *Inigo Jones MS* uses the Bible name, but, though dated
1607, it has been shown to be apocryphal. See *Gould's History*,
appendix. Also *Bulletin* of Supreme Council S. J., U. S. (vii, 200),
that the Strassburg builders pictured the legend in stone.

<span id="fn_74"></span>[111:1](bui08.htm#fr_74.md) *The Cathedral
Builders*, bk. i, chap. i.

<span id="fn_75"></span>[114:1](bui08.htm#fr_75.md) See the account of "The
Origin of Saxon Architecture," in the *Cathedral Builders* (bk. ii,
chap. iii), written by Dr. W. M. Barnes in England independently of the
author who was living in Italy; and it is significant that the facts led
both of them to the same conclusions. They show quite unmistakably that
the Comacine builders were in England as early as 600 A. D., both by
documents and by a comparative study of styles of architecture.

<span id="fn_76"></span>[115:1](bui08.htm#fr_76.md) *Maestri Comacini*,
vol. i, chap. ii.

<span id="fn_77"></span>[115:2](bui08.htm#fr_77.md) *Story of
Architecture*, chap. xxii.

<span id="fn_78"></span>[116:1](bui08.htm#fr_78.md) Gould, in his *History
of Masonry* (i, 31, 65), rejects the legend as having not the least
foundation in fact, as indeed, he rejects almost everything that cannot
prove itself in a court of law. For the other side see a "Critical
Examination of the Alban and Athelstan Legends," by C. C. Howard (*A. Q.
C.*, vii, 73). Meanwhile, Upton <span id="page_117">p. 117</span> points
out that St. Alban was the name of a town, not of a man, and shows how
the error may have crept into the record (*A. Q. C.*, vii, 119-131). The
nature of the tradition, its details, its motive, and the absence of any
reason for fiction, should deter us from rejecting it. See two able
articles, pro and con, by Begemann and Speth, entitled "The Assembly"
(*A. Q. C.*, vii). Older Masonic writers, like Oliver and Mackey,
accepted the York assembly as a fact established (*American Quarterly
Review of Freemasonry*, vol. i, 546; ii, 245).

<span id="fn_79"></span>[118:1](bui08.htm#fr_79.md) *History of the English
Constitution*. Of course the Guild was indigenous to almost every age
and land, from China to ancient Rome (*The Guilds of China*, by H. B.
Morse), and they survive in the trade and labor unions of our day. The
story of *English Guilds* has been told by Toulmin Smith, and in the
histories of particular companies by Herbert and Hazlitt, leaving little
for any one to add. No doubt the Guilds were influenced by the
Free-masons in respect of officers and emblems, and we know that some of
them, like the German Steinmetzen, attached moral meanings to their
working tools, and that others, like the French Companionage, even held
the legend of Hiram; but these did not make them Free-masons. English
writers like Speth go too far when they deny to <span id="page_119">p.
119</span> the Steinmetzen any esoteric lore, and German scholars like
Krause and Findel are equally at fault in insisting that they were
Free-masons. (See essay by Speth, *A. Q. C.*, i, 17, and *History of
Masonry*, by Steinbrenner, chap. iv.)

<span id="fn_80"></span>[120:1](bui08.htm#fr_80.md) *Notes on the
Superintendents of English Buildings in the Middle Ages*, by Wyatt
Papworth. [Cementarius](errata.htm#5.md) is also mentioned in connection
with the Salisbury Cathedral, again in his capacity as a Master Mason.

<span id="fn_81"></span>[123:1](bui08.htm#fr_81.md) Hearing that the Masons
had certain secrets that could not be revealed to her (for that she
could not be Grand Master) Queen Elizabeth sent an armed force to break
up their annual Grand Lodge at York, on St. John's Day, December 27,
1561. But Sir Thomas Sackville took care to see that some of the men
sent were Free-masons, who, joining in the communication, made "a very
honorable report to the Queen, who never more attempted to dislodge or
disturb them; but esteemed them a peculiar sort of men, that cultivated
peace and friendship, arts and sciences, without meddling in the affairs
of Church or State" (*Book of Constitutions*, by Anderson).
