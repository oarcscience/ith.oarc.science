<span id="page_238">p. 238</span>

*I am afraid you may not consider it an altogether substantial concern.
It has to be seen in a certain way, under certain conditions. Some
people never see it at all. You must understand, this is no dead pile of
stones and unmeaning timber. It is a LIVING thing*.

*When you enter it you hear a sound—a sound as of some mighty poem
chanted. Listen long enough, and you will learn that it is made up of
the beating of human hearts, of the nameless music of men's souls—that
is, if you have ears to hear. If you have eyes, you will presently see
the church itself—a looming mystery of many shapes and shadows, leaping
sheer from floor to dome. The work of no ordinary builder*!

*The pillars of it go up like the brawny trunks of heroes; the sweet
flesh of men and women is molded about its bulwarks, strong,
impregnable; the faces of little children laugh out from every corner
stone; the terrible spans and arches of it are the joined hands of
comrades; and up in the heights and spaces are inscribed the numberless
musings of all the dreamers of the world. It is yet building—building
and built upon*.

*Sometimes the work goes on in deep darkness; sometimes in blinding
light; now under the burden of unutterable anguish; now to the tune of
great laughter and heroic shoutings like the cry of thunder. Sometimes,
in the silence of the night-time, one may hear the tiny hammerings of
the comrades at work up in the dome—the comrades that have climbed
ahead*.

### CHAPTER I

### What is Masonry

#### I

WHAT, then, is Masonry, and what is it trying to do in the world?
According to one of the *Old Charges*, Masonry is declared to be an
"ancient and honorable institution: ancient no doubt it is, as having
subsisted from time immemorial; and honorable it must be acknowledged to
be, as by natural tendency it conduces to make those so who are obedient
to its precepts. To so high an eminence has its credit been advanced
that in every age Monarchs themselves have been promoters of the art,
have not thought it derogatory from their dignity to exchange the
scepter for the trowel, have patronized our mysteries and joined in our
Assemblies."

While that eulogy is more than justified by sober facts, it does not
tell us what Masonry is, much less its mission and ministry to mankind.
If now we turn to the old, oft-quoted definition, we learn that Masonry
is "a system of morality veiled in allegory

<span id="page_240">p. 240</span>

and illustrated by symbols." That is, in so far, true enough, but it is
obviously inadequate, the more so when it uses the word "peculiar" as
describing the morality of Masonry; and it gives no hint of a
world-encircling fellowship and its far-ramifying influence. Another
definition has it that Masonry is "a science which is engaged in the
search after divine truth;" <span id="fr_162"></span>[1](#fn_162.md) but
that is vague, indefinite, and unsatisfactory, lacking any sense of the
uniqueness of the Order, and as applicable to one science as to another.
For surely all science, of whatever kind, is a search after divine
truth, and a physical fact, as Agassiz said, is as sacred as a moral
truth—every fact being the presence of God.

Still another writer defines Masonry as "Friendship, Love, and
Integrity—Friendship which rises superior to the fictitious distinctions
of society, the prejudices of religion, and the pecuniary conditions of
life; Love which knows no limit, nor inequality, nor decay; Integrity
which binds man to the eternal law of duty." <span
id="fr_163"></span>[2](#fn_163.md) Such is indeed the very essence and
spirit of Masonry, but Masonry has no monopoly of

<span id="page_241">p. 241</span>

that spirit, and its uniqueness consists, rather, in the form in which
it seeks to embody and express the gracious and benign spirit which is
the genius of all the higher life of humanity. Masonry is not
everything; it is a thing as distinctly featured as a statue by Phidias
or a painting by Angelo. Definitions, like delays, may be dangerous, but
perhaps we can do no better than to adopt the words of the German
*Handbuch* <span id="fr_164"></span>[1](#fn_164.md) as the best description
of it so far given:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">*Masonry is the activity of closely united men who,
employing symbolical forms borrowed principally from the mason's trade
and from architecture, work for the welfare of mankind, striving morally
to ennoble themselves and others, and thereby to bring about a universal
league of mankind, which they aspire to exhibit even now on a small
scale*.</span>

</div>

Civilization could hardly begin until man had learned to fashion for
himself a settled habitation, and thus the earliest of all human arts
and crafts, and perhaps also the noblest, is that of the builder.
Religion took outward shape when men first reared an altar for their
offerings, and surrounded it with a sanctuary of faith and awe, of pity
and consolation, and piled a cairn to mark the graves where their dead
lay asleep. History is no older than architecture. How fitting, then,
that the idea and art of

<span id="page_242">p. 242</span>

building should be made the basis of a great order of men which has no
other aim than the upbuilding of humanity in Faith, Freedom, and
Friendship. Seeking to ennoble and beautify life, it finds in the common
task and constant labor of man its sense of human unity, its vision of
life as a temple "building and built upon," and its emblems of those
truths which make for purity of character and the stability of society.
Thus Masonry labors, linked with the constructive genius of mankind, and
so long as it remains true to its Ideal no weapon formed against it can
prosper.

One of the most impressive and touching things in human history is that
certain ideal interests have been set apart as especially venerated
among all peoples. Guilds have arisen to cultivate the interests
embodied in art, science, philosophy, fraternity, and religion; to
conserve the precious, hard-won inheritances of humanity; to train men
in their service; to bring their power to bear upon the common life of
mortals, and send through that common life the light and glory of the
Ideal—as the sun shoots its transfiguring rays through a great dull
cloud, evoking beauty from the brown earth. Such is Masonry, which
unites all these high interests and brings to their service a vast,
world-wide fraternity of free and devout men, built upon a foundation of

<span id="page_243">p. 243</span>

spiritual faith and moral idealism, whose mission it is to make men
friends, to refine and exalt their lives, to deepen their faith and
purify their dream, to turn them from the semblance of life to homage
for truth, beauty, righteousness, and character. More than an
institution, more than a tradition, more than a society, Masonry is one
of the forms of the Divine Life upon earth. No one may ever hope to
define a spirit so gracious, an order so benign, an influence so
prophetic of the present and future up-building of the race.

There is a common notion that Masonry is a secret society, and this idea
is based on the secret rites used in its initiations, and the signs and
grips by which its members recognize each other. Thus it has come to
pass that the main aims of the Order are assumed to be a secret policy
or teaching, <span id="fr_165"></span>[1](#fn_165.md) whereas

<span id="page_244">p. 244</span>

*its one great secret is that it has no secret*. Its principles are
published abroad in its writings; its purposes and laws are known, and
the times and places of its meetings. Having come down from dark days of
persecution, when all the finer things sought the protection of
seclusion, if it still adheres to secret rites, it is not in order to
hide the truth, but the better to teach it more impressively, to train
men in its pure service, and to promote union and amity upon earth. Its
signs and grips serve as a kind of universal language, and still more as
a gracious cover for the practice of sweet charity—making it easier to
help a fellow man in dire plight without hurting his self-respect. If a
few are attracted to it by curiosity, all remain to pray, finding
themselves members of a great historic fellowship of the seekers and
finders of God. <span id="fr_166"></span>[1](#fn_166.md) It is old because
it is true; had it been false it would have perished long ago. When all
men practice its simple precepts, the innocent secrets of Masonry will
be laid bare, its mission accomplished, and its labor done.

#### II

Recalling the emphasis of the foregoing pages, it need hardly be added
that Masonry is in no sense a

<span id="page_245">p. 245</span>

political party, still less a society organized for social agitation.
Indeed, because Masonry stands apart from partisan feud and particular
plans of social reform, she has been held up to ridicule equally by the
unthinking, the ambitious, and the impatient. Her critics on this side
are of two kinds. There are those who hold that the humanitarian ideal
is an error, maintaining that human nature has no moral aptitude, and
can be saved only by submission to a definite system of dogma. Then
there are those who look for salvation solely in political action and
social agitation, who live in the delusion that man can be made better
by passing laws and counting votes, and to whom Masonry has nothing to
offer because in its ranks it permits no politics, much less party
rancor. Advocates of the first view have fought Masonry from the
beginning with the sharpest weapons, while those who hold the second
view regard it with contempt, as a thing useless and not worth
fighting. <span id="fr_167"></span>[1](#fn_167.md)

Neither adversary understands Masonry and its cult of the creative love
for humanity, and of each man for his fellow, without which no dogma is
of any worth; lacking which, the best laid plans of social seers "gang
aft aglee." Let us look at things as they are. That we must press
forward towards

<span id="page_246">p. 246</span>

righteousness—that we must hunger and thirst after a social life that is
true and pure, just and merciful—all will agree; but they are blind who
do not see that the way is long and the process slow. What is it that so
tragically delays the march of man to-ward the better and wiser social
order whereof our prophets dream? Our age, like the ages gone before, is
full of schemes of every kind for the reform and betterment of mankind.
Why do they not succeed? Some fail, perhaps, because they are imprudent
and ill-considered, in that they expect too much of human nature and do
not take into account the stubborn facts of life. But why does not the
wisest and noblest plan do more than half what its advocates hope and
pray and labor so heroically to bring about? Because there are not
enough men fine enough of soul, large enough of sympathy, sweet enough
of spirit, and noble enough of nature to make the dream come true!

There are no valid arguments against a great-spirited social justice but
this—that men will not. Indolence, impurity, greed, injustice, meanness
of spirit, the aggressiveness of authority, and above all jealousy—these
are the real obstacles that thwart the nobler social aspiration of
humanity. There are too many men like *The Master-Builder* who tried to
build higher than any one else, without regard to

<span id="page_247">p. 247</span>

others, all for his own selfish glory. Ibsen has shown us how *The
Pillars of Society*, resting on rotten foundations, came crashing down,
wounding the innocent in their wreck. Long ago it was said that "through
wisdom is an house builded, and by under-standing it is established; and
by knowledge shall the chambers be filled with pleasant and precious
riches." <span id="fr_168"></span>[1](#fn_168.md) Time has shown that the
House of Wisdom must be founded upon righteousness, justice, purity,
character, faith in God and love of man, else it will fall when the
floods descend and the winds beat upon it. What we need to make our
social dreams come true is not more laws, not more dogmas, not less
liberty, but better men, cleaner minded, more faithful, with loftier
ideals and more heroic integrity; men who love the right, honor the
truth, worship purity, and prize liberty—upright men who meet all
horizontals at a perfect angle, assuring the virtue and stability of the
social order.

Therefore, when Masonry, instead of identifying itself with particular
schemes of reform, and thus becoming involved in endless turmoil and
dispute, estranging men whom she seeks to bless, devotes all her benign
energy and influence to *ennobling the souls of men*, she is doing
fundamental work in behalf of all high enterprises. By as much as she
succeeds,

<span id="page_248">p. 248</span>

every noble cause succeeds; by as much as she fails, everything fails!
By its ministry to the individual man—drawing him into the circle of a
great friendship, exalting his faith, refining his ideals, enlarging his
sympathies, and setting his feet in the long white path—Masonry best
serves society and the state. <span id="fr_169"></span>[1](#fn_169.md)
While it is not a reformatory, it is a center of moral and spiritual
power, and its power is used, not only to protect the widow and orphan,
but also, and still more important, to remove the cause of their woe and
need by making men just, gentle, and generous to all their fellow
mortals. Who can measure such a silent, persistent, unresting labor; who
can describe its worth in a world of feud, of bitterness, of sorrow!

No one needs to be told that we are on the eve, if not in the midst, of
a most stupendous and bewildering revolution of social and industrial
life. It shakes England today. It makes France tremble tomorrow. It
alarms America next week. Men want

<span id="page_249">p. 249</span>

shorter hours, higher wages, and better homes—of course they do—but they
need, more than these things, to know and love each other; for the
questions in dispute can never be settled in an air of hostility. If
they are ever settled at all, and settled right, it must be in an
atmosphere of mutual recognition and respect, such as Masonry seeks to
create and make prevail. Whether it be a conflict of nations, or a clash
of class with class, appeal must be made to intelligence and the moral
sense, as befits the dignity of man. Amidst bitterness and strife
Masonry brings men of every rank and walk of life together as men, and
nothing else, at an altar where they can talk and not fight, discuss and
not dispute, and each may learn the point of view of his fellow. Other
hope there is none save in this spirit of friendship and fairness, of
democracy and the fellowship of man with man. Once this spirit has its
way with mankind, it will bring those brave, large reconstructions,
those profitable abnegations and brotherly feats of generosity that will
yet turn human life into a glad, beautiful, and triumphant coöperation
all round this sunlit world.

Surely the way of Masonry is wise. Instead of becoming only one more
factor in a world of factional feud, it seeks to remove all hostility
which may arise from social, national, or religious differences. It
helps to heal the haughtiness of the rich and the

<span id="page_250">p. 250</span>

envy of the poor, and tends to establish peace on earth by allaying all
fanaticism and hatred on account of varieties of language, race, creed,
and even color, while striving to make the wisdom of the past available
for the culture of men in faith and purity. Not a party, not a sect, not
a cult, it is a great order of men selected, initiated, sworn, and
trained to make sweet reason and the will of God prevail! Against the
ancient enmities and inhumanities of the world it wages eternal war,
without vengeance, without violence, but by softening the hearts of men
and inducing a better spirit. Apparitions of a day, here for an hour and
tomorrow gone, what is our puny warfare against evil and ignorance
compared with the warfare which this venerable Order has been waging
against them for ages, and will continue to wage after we have fallen
into dust!

#### III

Masonry, as it is much more than a political party or a social cult, is
also more than a church—unless we use the word church as Ruskin used it
when he said: "There is a true church wherever one hand meets another
helpfully, the only holy or mother church that ever was or ever shall
be!" It is true that Masonry is not *a* religion, but it is Religion, a
worship in which all good men may unite, that each

<span id="page_251">p. 251</span>

may share the faith of all. Often it has been objected that some men
leave the Church and enter the Masonic Lodge, finding there a religious
home. Even so, but that may be the fault, not of Masonry, but of the
Church so long defamed by bigotry and distracted by sectarian feud, and
which has too often made acceptance of abstract dogmas a test of its
fellowship. <span id="fr_170"></span>[1](#fn_170.md) Naturally many fine
minds have been estranged from the Church, not because they were
irreligious, but because they were required to believe what it was
impossible for them to believe; and, rather than sacrifice their
integrity of soul, they . have turned away from the last place from
which a man should ever turn away. No part of the ministry of Masonry is
more beautiful and wise than its appeal, not for tolerance, but for
fraternity; not for uniformity, but for unity of spirit amidst varieties

<span id="page_252">p. 252</span>

of outlook and opinion. Instead of criticizing Masonry, let us thank God
for one altar where no man is asked to surrender his liberty of thought
and become an indistinguishable atom in a mass of sectarian
agglomeration. What a witness to the worth of an Order that it brings
together men of all creeds in behalf of those truths which are greater
than all sects, deeper than all doctrines—the glory and the hope of man!

While Masonry is not a church, it has religiously preserved some things
of highest importance to the Church—among them the right of each
individual soul to its own religious faith. Holding aloof from separate
sects and creeds, it has taught all of them

<span id="page_253">p. 253</span>

how to respect and tolerate each other; asserting a principle broader
than any of them—the sanctity of the soul and the duty of every man to
revere, or at least to regard with charity, what is sacred to his
fellows. It is like the crypts underneath the old cathedrals—a place
where men of every creed who long for something deeper and truer, older
and newer than they have hitherto known, meet and unite. Having put away
childish things, they find themselves made one by a profound and
childlike faith, each bringing down into that quiet crypt his own pearl
of great price—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">The Hindu his innate disbelief in this world, and
his unhesitating belief in another world; the Buddhist his perception of
an eternal law, his submission to it, his gentleness, his pity; the
Mohammedan, if nothing else, his sobriety; the Jew his clinging, through
good and evil days, to the one God who loveth righteousness, and whose
name is "I AM;" the Christian, that which is better than all, if those
who doubt it would try it—our love of God, call Him what you will,
manifested in our love of man, our love of the living, our love of the
dead, our living and undying love. Who knows but that the crypt of the
past may become the church of the future? <span
id="fr_171"></span>[1](#fn_171.md)</span>

</div>

Of no one age, Masonry belongs to all ages; of no one religion, it finds
great truths in all religions. Indeed, it holds that truth which is
common to all elevating and benign religions, and is the basis of

<span id="page_254">p. 254</span>

each; that faith which underlies all sects and over-arches all creeds,
like the sky above and the river bed below the flow of mortal years. It
does not under-take to explain or dogmatically to settle those questions
or solve those dark mysteries which out-top human knowledge. Beyond the
facts of faith it does not go. With the subtleties of speculation
concerning those truths, and the unworldly envies growing out of them,
it has not to do. There divisions begin, and Masonry was not made to
divide men, but to unite them, leaving each man free to think his own
thought and fashion his own system of ultimate truth. All its emphasis
rests upon two extremely simple and profound principles—love of God and
love of man. Therefore, all through the ages it has been, and is today,
a meeting place of differing minds, and a prophecy of the final union of
all reverent and devout souls.

Time was when one man framed a dogma and declared it to be the eternal
truth. Another man did the same thing, with a different dogma; then the
two began to hate each other with an unholy hatred, each seeking to
impose his dogma upon the other—and that is an epitome of some of the
blackest pages of history. Against those old sectarians who substituted
intolerance for charity, persecution for friendship, and did not love
God because they hated

<span id="page_255">p. 255</span>

their neighbors, Masonry made eloquent protest, putting their bigotry to
shame by its simple insight, and the dignity of its golden voice. A vast
change of heart is now taking place in the religious world, by reason of
an exchange of thought and courtesy, and a closer personal touch, and
the various sects, so long estranged, are learning to unite upon the
things most worth while and the least open to debate. That is to say,
they are moving toward the Masonic position, and when they arrive
Masonry will witness a scene which she has prophesied for ages.

At last, in the not distant future, the old feuds of the sects will come
to an end, forgotten in the discovery that the just, the brave, the
true-hearted are everywhere of one religion, and that when the masks of
misunderstanding are taken off they know and love one another. Our
little dogmas will have their day and cease to be, lost in the vision of
a truth so great that all men are one in their littleness; one also in
their assurance of the divinity of the soul and "the kindness of the
veiled Father of men." Then men of every name will ask, when they meet:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Not what is your creed?  
But what is your need?</span>

</div>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> High above all
dogmas that divide, all bigotries that blind, all bitterness that
beclouds, will be written the

<span id="page_256">p. 256</span>

simple words of the one eternal religion—the Fatherhood of God, the
brotherhood of man, the moral law, the golden rule, and the hope of a
life everlasting!

<span id="fn_165"></span>[243:1](bui13.htm#fr_165.md) Much has been written
about the secrecy of Masonry. Hutchinson, in his lecture on "The Secrecy
of Masons," lays all the stress upon its privacy as a shelter for the
gentle ministry of Charity (*Spirit of Masonry*, lecture x). Arnold is
more satisfactory in his essay on "The Philosophy of Mystery," quoting
the words of Carlyle in *Sartor Resartus*: "Bees will not work except in
darkness; thoughts will not work except in silence; neither will virtue
work except in secrecy" (*History and Philosophy of Masonry*, chap.
xxi). But neither writer seems to realize the psychology and pedagogy of
secrecy—the value of curiosity, of wonder and expectation, in the
teaching of great truths deemed commonplace because old. Even in that
atmosphere, the real secret of Masonry remains hidden to many—as
sunlight hides the depths of heaven.

<span id="fn_169"></span>[248:1](bui13.htm#fr_169.md) While Masonry abjures
political questions and disputes in its Lodges, it is all the while
training good citizens, and through the quality of its men it influences
public life—as Washington, Franklin, and Marshall carried the spirit of
Masonry into the organic law of this republic. It is not politics that
corrupts character; it is bad character that corrupts politics—and by
building men up to spiritual faith and character, Masonry is helping to
build up a state that will endure the shocks of time; a nobler structure
than ever was wrought of mortar and marble (*The Principles of
Freemasonry in the Life of Nations*, by Findel).

<span id="fn_170"></span>[251:1](bui13.htm#fr_170.md) Not a little
confusion has existed, and still exists, in regard to the relation of
Masonry to religion. Dr. Mackey said that old Craft-masonry was
sectarian (*Symbolism of Masonry*); but it was not more so than Dr.
Mackey himself, who held the curious theory that the religion of the
Hebrews was genuine and that of the Egyptians spurious. Nor is there any
evidence that Craft-masonry was sectarian, but much to the contrary, as
has been shown in reference to the invocations in the *Old Charges*. At
any rate, if it was ever sectarian, it ceased to be so with the
organization of the Grand Lodge of England. Later, some of the chaplains
of the order sought to identify Masonry with Christianity, as Hutchinson
did—and even Arnold in his chapter on "Christianity and Freemasonry"
(*History and Philosophy of Masonry*). All this confusion results from a
<span id="page_252">p. 252</span> misunderstanding of what religion is.
Religions are many; religion is one—perhaps we may say one thing, but
that one thing includes everything—the life of God in the soul of man,
which finds expression in all the forms which life and love and duty
take. This conception of religion shakes the poison out of all our wild
flowers, and shows us that it is the inspiration of all scientific
inquiry, all striving for liberty, all virtue and charity; the spirit of
all thought, the motif of all great music, the soul of all sublime
literature. The church has no monopoly of religion, nor did the Bible
create it. Instead, it was religion—the natural and simple trust of the
soul in a Power above and within it, and its quest of a right relation
to that Power—that created the Bible and the Church, and, indeed, all
our higher human life. The soul of man is greater than all books, deeper
than all dogmas, and more enduring than all institutions. Masonry seeks
to free men from a limiting conception of religion, and thus to remove
one of the chief causes of sectarianism. It is itself one of the forms
of beauty wrought by the human soul under the inspiration of the Eternal
Beauty, and as such is religious.
