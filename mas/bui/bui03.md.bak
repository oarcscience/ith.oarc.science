*By Symbols is man guided and commanded, made happy, made wretched. He
everywhere finds himself encompassed with Symbols, recognized as such or
not recognized: the Universe is but one vast Symbol of God; nay, if thou
wilt have it, what is man himself but a Symbol of God; is not all that
he does symbolical; a revelation to Sense of the mystic God-given force
that is in him; a Gospel of Freedom, which he, the Messiah of Nature,
preaches, as he can, by word and act? Not a Hut he builds but is the
visible embodiment of a Thought; but bears visible record of invisible
things; but is, in the transcendental sense, symbolical as well as
real*.

### CHAPTER I

### The Foundations

TWO arts have altered the face of the earth and given shape to the life
and thought of man, Agriculture and Architecture. Of the two, it would
be hard to know which has been the more intimately interwoven with the
inner life of humanity; for man is not only a planter and a builder, but
a mystic and a thinker. For such a being, especially in primitive times,
any work was something more than itself; it was a truth found out. In
becoming useful it attained some form, enshrining at once a thought and
a mystery. Our present study has to do with the second of these arts,
which has been called the matrix of civilization.

When we inquire into origins and seek the initial force which carried
art forward, we find two fundamental factors—physical necessity and
spiritual aspiration. Of course, the first great impulse of all
architecture was need, honest response to the demand for shelter; but
this demand included a Home for the Soul, not less than a roof over the
head.

<span id="page_6">p. 6</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Even in this
response to primary need there was something spiritual which carried it
beyond provision for the body; as the men of Egypt, for instance, wanted
an indestructible resting-place, and so built the pyramids. As Capart
says, prehistoric art shows that this utilitarian purpose was in almost
every case blended with a religious, or at least a magical,
purpose. <span id="fr_0"></span>[1](#fn_0.md) The spiritual instinct, in
seeking to recreate types and to set up more sympathetic relations with
the universe, led to imitation, to ideas of proportion, to the passion
for beauty, and to the effort after perfection.

Man has been always a builder, and nowhere has he shown himself more
significantly than in the buildings he has erected. When we stand before
them—whether it be a mud hut, the house of a cliff-dweller stuck like
the nest of a swallow on the side of a cañon, a Pyramid, a Parthenon, or
a Pantheon—we seem to read into his soul. The builder may have gone,
perhaps ages before, but here he has left something of himself, his
hopes, his fears, his ideas, his dreams. Even in the remote recesses of
the Andes, amidst the riot of nature, and where man is now a mere
savage, we come upon the remains of vast, vanished civilizations, where
art and science and religion reached unknown heights.

<span id="page_7">p. 7</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Wherever humanity
has lived and wrought, we find the crumbling ruins of towers, temples,
and tombs, monuments of its industry and its aspiration. Also, whatever
else man may have been—cruel, tyrannous, vindictive—his buildings always
have reference to religion. They bespeak a vivid sense of the Unseen and
his awareness of his relation to it. Of a truth, the story of the Tower
of Babel is more than a myth. Man has ever been trying to build to
heaven, embodying his prayer and his dream in brick and stone.

For there are two sets of realities—material and spiritual—but they are
so interwoven that all practical laws are exponents of moral laws. Such
is the thesis which Ruskin expounds with so much insight and eloquence
in his *Seven Lamps of Architecture*, in which he argues that the laws
of architecture are moral laws, as applicable to the building of
character as to the construction of cathedrals. He finds those laws to
be Sacrifice, Truth, Power, Beauty, Life, Memory, and, as the crowning
grace of all, that principle to which Polity owes its stability, Life
its happiness, Faith its acceptance, and Creation its
continuance—*Obedience*. He holds that there is no such thing as
liberty, and never can be. The stars have it not; the earth has it not;
the sea has it not. Man fancies that he has freedom, but if he

<span id="page_8">p. 8</span>

would use the word Loyalty instead of Liberty, he would be nearer the
truth, since it is by obedience to the laws of life and truth and beauty
that he attains to what he calls liberty.

Throughout that brilliant essay, Ruskin shows how the violation of moral
laws spoils the beauty of architecture, mars its usefulness, and makes
it unstable. He points out, with all the variations of emphasis,
illustration, and appeal, that beauty is what is imitated from natural
forms, consciously or unconsciously, and that what is not so derived,
but depends for its dignity upon arrangement received from the human
mind, expresses, while it reveals, the quality of the mind, whether it
be noble or ignoble. Thus:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">All building, therefore, shows man either as
gathering or governing; and the secrets of his success are his knowing
what to gather, and how to rule. These are the two great intellectual
Lamps of Architecture; the one consisting in a just and humble
veneration of the works of God upon earth, and the other in an
understanding of the dominion over those works which has been vested in
man. <span id="fr_1"></span>[1](#fn_1.md)</span>

</div>

What our great prophet of art thus elaborated so eloquently, the early
men forefelt by instinct, dimly it may be, but not less truly. If
architecture was born of need it soon showed its magic quality, and

<span id="page_9">p. 9</span>

all true building touched depths of feeling and opened gates of wonder.
No doubt the men who first balanced one stone over two others must have
looked with astonishment at the work of their hands, and have worshiped
the stones they had set up. This element of mystical wonder and awe
lasted long through the ages, and is still felt when work is done in the
old way by keeping close to nature, necessity, and faith. From the
first, ideas of sacredness, of sacrifice, of ritual rightness, of magic
stability, of likeness to the universe, of perfection of form and
proportion glowed in the heart of the builder, and guided his arm. Wren,
philosopher as he was, decided that the delight of man in setting up
columns was acquired through worshiping in the groves of the forest; and
modern research has come to much the same view, for Sir Arthur Evans
shows that in the first European age columns were gods. All over Europe
the early morning of architecture was spent in the worship of great
stones. <span id="fr_2"></span>[1](#fn_2.md)

If we go to old Egypt, where the art of building seems first to have
gathered power, and where its remains are best preserved, we may read
the ideas of the earliest artists. Long before the dynastic period a
strong people inhabited the land who developed many arts which they
handed on to the

<span id="page_10">p. 10</span>

pyramid-builders. Although only semi-naked savages using flint
instruments in a style much like the Bushmen, they were the root, so to
speak, of a wonderful artistic stock. Of the Egyptians Herodotus said,
"They gather the fruits of the earth with less labor than any other
people." With agriculture and settled life came trade and stored-up
energy which might essay to improve on caves and pits and other rude
dwellings. By the Nile, perhaps, man first aimed to overpass the routine
of the barest need, and obey his soul. There he wrought out beautiful
vases of fine marble, and invented square building.

At any rate, the earliest known structure actually discovered, a
prehistoric tomb found in the sands at Hieraconpolis, is already
right-angled. As Lethaby reminds us, modern people take squareness very
much for granted as being a self-evident form, but the discovery of the
square was a great step in geometry. <span id="fr_3"></span>[1](#fn_3.md)
It opened a new era in the story of the builders. Early inventions must
have seemed like revelations, as indeed they were; and it is not strange
that skilled craftsmen were looked upon as magicians. If man knows as
much as he does, the discovery of the Square was a great event to the
primitive mystics of the Nile. Very early it became

<span id="page_11">p. 11</span>

an emblem of truth, justice, and righteousness, and so it remains to
this day though uncountable ages have passed. Simple, familiar,
eloquent, it brings from afar a sense of the wonder of the dawn, and it
still teaches a lesson which we find it hard to learn. So also the cube,
the compasses, and the keystone, each a great advance for those to whom
architecture was indeed "building touched with emotion," as showing that
its laws are the laws of the Eternal.

Maspero tells us that the temples of Egypt, even from earliest times,
were built in the image of the earth as the builders had imagined
it. <span id="fr_4"></span>[1](#fn_4.md) For them the earth was a sort of
flat slab more long than wide, and the sky was a ceiling or vault
supported by four great pillars. The pavement represented the earth; the
four angles stood for the pillars; the ceiling, more often flat, though
sometimes curved, corresponded to the sky. From the pavement grew
vegetation, and water plants emerged from the water; while the ceiling,
painted dark blue, was strewn with stars of five points. Sometimes, the
sun and moon were seen floating on the heavenly ocean escorted by the
constellations, and the months and days. There was a far withdrawn holy
place, small and obscure, approached through a succession

<span id="page_12">p. 12</span>

of courts and columned halls, all so arranged on a central axis as to
point to the sunrise. Before the outer gates were obelisks and avenues
of statues. Such were the shrines of the old solar religion, so oriented
that on one day in the year the beams of the rising sun, or of some
bright star that hailed his coming, should stream down the nave and
illumine the altar. <span id="fr_5"></span>[1](#fn_5.md)

Clearly, one ideal of the early builders was that of sacrifice, as seen
in their use of the finest materials; and another was accuracy of
workmanship. Indeed, not a little of the earliest work displayed an
astonishing technical ability, and such work must point to some
underlying idea which the workers sought to realize. Above all things
they sought permanence. In later inscriptions relating to buildings,
phrases like these occur frequently: "it is such as the heavens in all
its quarters;" "firm as the heavens." Evidently the basic idea was that,
as the heavens were stable, not to be moved, so a building put into
proper relation with the universe would acquire magical stability. It is
recorded that when Ikhnaton founded his new city, four boundary stones
were accurately placed, that so it might be exactly square, and thus
endure forever. Eternity was the ideal aimed at, everything else being
sacrificed for that aspiration.

<span id="page_13">p. 13</span>

How well they realized their dream is shown us in the Pyramids, of all
monuments of mankind the oldest, the most technically perfect, the
largest, and the most mysterious. Ages come and go, empires rise and
fall, philosophies flourish and fail, and man seeks him out many
inventions, but they stand silent under the bright Egyptian night, as
fascinating as they are baffling. An obelisk is simply a pyramid, albeit
the base has become a shaft, holding aloft the oldest emblems of solar
faith—a Triangle mounted on a Square. When and why this figure became
holy no one knows, save as we may conjecture that it was one of those
sacred stones which gained its sanctity in times far back of all
recollection and tradition, like the *Ka’aba* at Mecca. Whether it be an
imitation of the triangle of zodiacal light, seen at certain times in
the eastern sky at sunrise and sunset, or a feat of masonry used as a
symbol of Heaven, as the Square was an emblem of Earth, no one may
affirm. <span id="fr_6"></span>[1](#fn_6.md) In the Pyramid Texts the
Sun-god, when he created all the other gods, is shown sitting on the
apex of the sky in the form of a Phoenix—that

<span id="page_14">p. 14</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Supreme God to
whom two architects, Suti and Hor, wrote so noble a hymn of
praise. <span id="fr_7"></span>[1](#fn_7.md)

White with the worship of ages, ineffably beautiful and pathetic, is the
old light-religion of humanity—a sublime nature-mysticism in which Light
was love and life, and Darkness evil and death. For the early man light
was the mother of beauty, the unveiler of color, the elusive and radiant
mystery of the world, and his speech about it was reverent and grateful.
At the gates of the morning he stood with uplifted hands, and the sun
sinking in the desert at eventide made him wistful in prayer, half fear
and half hope, lest the beauty return no more. His religion, when he
emerged from the night of animalism, was a worship of the Light—his
temple hung with stars, his altar a glowing flame, his ritual a woven
hymn of night and day. No poet of our day, not even Shelley, has written
lovelier lyrics in praise of the Light than those hymns of Ikhnaton in
the morning of the world. <span id="fr_8"></span>[2](#fn_8.md) Memories of
this religion of the dawn linger with

<span id="page_15">p. 15</span>

us today in the faith that follows the Day-Star from on high, and the
Sun of Righteousness—One who is the Light of the World in life, and the
Lamp of Poor Souls in the night of death.

Here, then, are the real foundations of Masonry, both material and
moral: in the deep need and aspiration of man, and his creative impulse;
in his instinctive Faith, his quest of the Ideal, and his love of the
Light. Underneath all his building lay the feeling, prophetic of his
last and highest thought, that the earthly house of his life should be
in right relation with its heavenly prototype, the
world-temple—imitating on earth the house not made with hands, eternal
in the heavens. If he erected a square temple, it was an image of the
earth; if he built a pyramid, it was a picture of a beauty shown him in
the sky; as, later, his cathedral was modelled after the mountain, and
its dim and lofty arch a memory of the forest vista—its altar a fireside
of the soul, its spire a prayer in stone. And as he wrought his faith
and dream into reality, it was but natural that the tools of the builder
should become emblems of the thoughts of the thinker. Not only his
tools, but, as we shall see, the very stones with which he worked became
sacred symbols—the temple itself a vision of that House of Doctrine,
that Home of the Soul, which, though unseen, he is building in the midst
of the years.

where Horns of the Horizon had his throne. This is, in so far, true; but
the pyramid emblem was older than Osiris, Isis, and Horns, and runs hack

Dr. Breasted puts his lyrics alongside the poems of Wordsworth and the

the revenge of his enemies, he stands out as a lonely, heroic, prophetic
