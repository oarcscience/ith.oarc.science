*These signs and tokens are of no small value; they speak a universal
language, and act as a passport to the attention and support of the
initiated in all parts of the world. They cannot be lost so long as
memory retains its power. Let the possessor of them be expatriated,
ship-wrecked, or imprisoned; let him be stripped of everything he has
got in the world; still these credentials remain and are available for
use as circumstances require*.

*The great effects which they have produced are established by the most
incontestable facts of history. They have stayed the uplifted hand of
the destroyer; they have softened the asperities of the tyrant; they
have mitigated the horrors of captivity; they have subdued the rancor of
malevolence, and broken down the barriers of political animosity and
sectarian alienation*.

*On the field of battle, in the solitude of the uncultivated forests, or
in the busy haunts of the crowded city, they have made men of the most
hostile feelings, and most distant religions, and the most diversified
conditions, rush to the aid of each other, and feel a social joy and
satisfaction that they have been able to afford relief to a brother
Mason*.—BENJAMIN FRANKLIN

### CHAPTER V

### Universal Masonry

#### I

HENCEFORTH the Masons of England were no longer a society of
handicraftsmen, but an association of men of all orders and every
vocation, as also of almost every creed, who met together on the broad
basis of humanity, and recognized no standard of human worth other than
morality, kindliness, and love of truth. They retained the symbolism of
the old Operative Masonry, <span id="fr_132"></span>[1](#fn_132.md) its
language, its legends, its ritual, and its oral tradition. No longer did
they build churches, but the spiritual

<span id="page_202">p. 202</span>

temple of humanity; using the Square not to measure right angles of
blocks of stone, but for evening the inequalities of human character,
nor the Compass any more to describe circles on a tracing-board, but to
draw a Circle of goodwill around all mankind.

Howbeit, one generation of men, as Hume re-marks, does not go off the
stage at once, and another succeed, like silkworms and butterflies. No
more did this metamorphosis of Masonry, so to name it, take place
suddenly or radically, as it has become the fashion to think. It was a
slow process, and like every such period the Epoch of Transition was
attended by many problems, uncertainties, and difficulties. Some of the
Lodges, as we have noted, would never agree to admit Accepted Masons, so
jealous were they of the ancient landmarks of the Craft. Even the Grand
Lodge, albeit a revival of the old Assembly, was looked upon with
suspicion by not a few, as tending toward undue centralization; and not
without cause. From the first the Grand Master was given more power than
was ever granted to the President of an ancient Assembly; of necessity
so, perhaps, but it led to misunderstanding. Other influences added to
the confusion, and at the same time emphasized the need of welding the
order into a more coherent unity for its wider service to humanity.

<span id="page_203">p. 203</span>

There are hints to the effect that the new Masonry, if so it may be
called, made very slow progress in the public favor at first, owing to
the conditions just stated; and this despite the remark of Anderson in
June, 1719: "Now several old Brothers that had neglected the Craft,
visited the Lodges; some Noblemen were also made Brothers, and more new
Lodges were constituted." Stuckely, the antiquarian, tells us in his
*Diary* under date of January, 1721—at which time he was initiated—that
he was the first person made a Mason in London for years, and that it
was not easy to find men enough to perform the ceremony. Incidentally,
he confides to us that he entered the order in search of the long hidden
secrets of "the Ancient Mysteries." No doubt he exaggerated in the
matter of numbers, though it is possible that initiations were
comparatively few at the time, the Lodges being recruited, for the most
part, by the adhesion of old Masons, both Operative and Speculative; and
among his friends he may have had some difficulty in finding men with an
adequate knowledge of the ritual. But that there was any real difficulty
in gathering together seven Masons in London is, on the face of it,
absurd. Immediately thereafter, Stuckely records, Masonry "took a run,
and ran itself out of breath through the folly of its members," but he
does not tell us what the folly was. The "run" referred to was almost

<span id="page_204">p. 204</span>

certainly due to the acceptance by the Duke of Montagu of the Grand
Mastership, which gave the order a prestige it had never had before; and
it was also in the same year, 1721, that the old Constitutions of the
Craft were revised.

Twelve Lodges attended the June quarterly communication of the Grand
Lodge in 1721, sixteen in September, twenty in December, and by April,
1723, the number had grown to thirty. All these Lodges, be it noted,
were in London, a fact amply justifying the optimism of Anderson in the
last paragraph of the *Book of Constitutions*, issued in that year. So
far the Grand Lodge had not extended its jurisdiction beyond London and
Westminster, but the very next year, 1724, there were already nine
Lodges in the provinces acknowledging its obedience, the first being the
Lodge at the Queen's Head, City of Bath. Within a few years Masonry
extended its labors abroad, both on British and on foreign soil. The
first Lodge on foreign soil was founded by the Duke of Wharton at
Madrid, in 1728, and regularized the following year, by which time a
Lodge had been established at the East India Arms, Bengal, and also at
Gibraltar. It was not long before Lodges arose in many lands, founded by
English Masons or by men who had received initiation in England; these
Lodges, when sufficiently numerous, uniting under Grand Lodges—the old
Lodge at York, that

<span id="page_205">p. 205</span>

ancient Mecca of Masonry, had called itself a Grand Lodge as early as
1725. The Grand Lodge of Ireland was created in 1729, those of
Scotland <span id="fr_133"></span>[1](#fn_133.md) and France in 1736; a
Lodge at Hamburg in 1737, <span id="fr_134"></span>[2](#fn_134.md) though
it was not patented until 1740; the Unity Lodge at Frankfort-on-the-Main
in 1742, another at Vienna the same year; the Grand Lodge of the Three
World-spheres at Berlin in 1744; and so on, until the order made its
advent in Sweden, Switzer-land, Russia, Italy, Spain, and Portugal.

Following the footsteps of Masonry from land to land is almost as
difficult as tracing its early history, owing to the secrecy in which it
enwrapped

<span id="page_206">p. 206</span>

its movements. For example, in 1680 there came to South Carolina one
John Moore, a native of England, who before the close of the century
removed to Philadelphia, where, in 1703, he was Collector of the Port.
In a letter written by him in 1715, he mentions having "spent a few
evenings in festivity with my Masonic brethren." <span
id="fr_135"></span>[1](#fn_135.md) This is the first vestige of Masonry in
America, unless we accept as authentic a curious document in the early
history of Rhode Island, as follows: "This ye \[day and month
obliterated\] 1656, Wee mett att y House off Mordicai Campanell and
after synagog gave Abram Moses the degrees of Maconrie." <span
id="fr_136"></span>[2](#fn_136.md) On June 5, 1730, the first authority for
the assembling of Free-masons in America was issued by the Duke of
Norfolk, to Daniel Coxe, of New Jersey, appointing him Provincial Grand
Master of New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania; and three years later
Henry Price, of Boston, was appointed to the same office for New
England. But Masons had evidently been coming to the New World for
years, for the

<span id="page_207">p. 207</span>

two cases just cited date back of the Grand Lodge of 1717.

How soon Coxe acted on the authority given him is not certain, but the
*Pennsylvania Gazette*, published by Benjamin Franklin, contains many
references to Masonic affairs as early as July, 1730. Just when Franklin
himself became interested in Masonry is not of record—he was initiated
in 1730-31 <span id="fr_137"></span>[1](#fn_137.md)—but he was a leader, at
that day, of everything that would advance his adopted city; and the
"Junto," formed in 1725, often inaccurately called the Leathern-Apron
Club, owed its origin to him. In a Masonic item in the *Gazette* of
December 3, 1730, he refers to "several Lodges of Free-masons" in the
Province, and on June 9, 1732, notes the organization of the Grand Lodge
of Pennsylvania, of which he was appointed a Warden, at the Sun Tavern,
in Water Street. Two years later Franklin was elected Grand Master, and
the same year published an edition of the *Book of Constitutions*—the
first Masonic book issued in America.

<span id="page_208">p. 208</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Thus Masonry made
an early advent into the new world, in which it has labored so nobly,
helping to lay the foundations and building its own basic principles
into the organic law of the greatest of all republics.

### II

Returning to the Grand Lodge of England, we have now to make record of
ridicule and opposition from without, and, alas, of disloyalty and
discord within the order itself. With the publication of the *Book of
Constitutions*, by Anderson, in 1723, the platform and principles of
Masonry became matters of common knowledge, and its enemies were alert
and vigilant. None are so blind as those who will not see, and not a
few, unacquainted with the spirit of Masonry, or unable to grasp its
principle of liberality and tolerance, affected to detect in its secrecy
some dark political design; and this despite the noble charge in the
*Book of Constitutions* enjoining politics from entering the lodge—a
charge hardly less memorable than the article defining its attitude
toward differing religious creeds, and which it behooves Masons to keep
always in mind as both true and wise, especially in our day when effort
is being made to inject the religious issue into politics:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">In order to preserve peace and harmony no private
piques or quarrels must be brought within the door of <span
id="page_209">p. 209</span> the Lodge, far less any quarrel about
Religions or Nations or State-Policy, we being only, as Masons, of the
Catholic Religion above mentioned (the religion in which all men agree);
we are also of all Nations, Tongues, Kindreds and Languages, and are
resolved against all Politics as what never yet conduced to the welfare
of the Lodge, nor ever will. This charge has always been actively
enjoined and observed; but especially ever since the Reformation in
Britain or the dissent and secession of these Nations from the communion
of Rome.</span>

</div>

No sooner had these noble words been printed, <span
id="fr_138"></span>[1](#fn_138.md) than there came to light a secret
society calling itself the "truly Ancient Noble Order of the Gormogons,"
alleged to have been instituted by Chin-Quaw Ky-Po, the first Emperor of
China, many thousand years before Adam. Notice of a meeting of the order
appeared in the *Daily Post*, September 3, 1723, in which it was stated,
among other high-sounding declarations, that "no Mason will be received
as a Member till he has renounced his noble order and been properly
degraded." Obviously, from this notice and others of like kind—all
hinting at the secrets of the Lodges—the order was

<span id="page_210">p. 210</span>

aping Masonry by way of parody with intent to destroy it, if possible,
by ridicule. For all that, if we may believe the Saturday Post of
October following, "many eminent Freemasons" had by that time "degraded
themselves" and gone over to the Gormogons. Not "many" perhaps, but,
alas, one eminent Mason at least, none other than a Past Grand Master,
the Duke of Wharton, who, piqued at an act of the Grand Lodge, had
turned against it. Erratic of mind, unstable of morals, having an
inordinate lust for praise, and pilloried as a "fool" by Pope in his
Moral Essays, he betrayed his fraternity—as, later, he turned traitor to
his faith, his flag, and his native land!

Simultaneously with the announcement that many eminent Masons had
"degraded themselves"—words most fitly chosen—and gone over to the
Gormogons, there appeared a book called the *Grand Mystery of Freemasons
Discovered*, and the cat was out of the bag. Everything was plain to the
Masons, and if it had not been clear, the way in which the writer
emphasized his hatred of the Jesuits would have told it all. It was a
Jesuit <span id="fr_139"></span>[1](#fn_139.md) plot hatched

<span id="page_211">p. 211</span>

in Rome to expose the secrets of Masonry, and making use of the
dissolute and degenerate Mason for that purpose—tactics often enough
used in the name of Jesus! Curiously enough, this was further made
evident by the fact that the order ceased to exist in 1738, the year in
which Clement XII published his Bull against the Masons. Thereupon the
"ancient order of Gormogons" swallowed itself, and so disappeared—not,
however, without one last, futile effort to achieve its ends. <span
id="fr_140"></span>[1](#fn_140.md) Naturally this episode stirred the
Masons deeply. It was denounced in burning words on the floor of the
Grand Lodge, which took new caution to guard its rites from treachery
and vandalism, in which respects it had not exercised due care,
admitting men to the order who were unworthy of the honor.

<span id="page_212">p. 212</span>

There were those who thought that the power of Masonry lay in its
secrecy; some think so still, not knowing that its *real* power lies in
the sanctity of its truth, the simplicity of its faith, the sweetness of
its spirit, and its service to mankind, and that if all its rites were
made public today it would still hold the hearts of men. <span
id="fr_141"></span>[1](#fn_141.md) Nevertheless, of alleged exposures there
were many between 1724 and 1730, both anonymous and signed, and they
made much ado, especially among men who were not Masons. It will be
enough to name the most famous, as well as the most elaborate, of them
all, *Masonry Dissected*, by Samuel Prichard, which ran through three
editions in one month, October, 1730, and called out a noble *Defence of
Masonry*, written, it is thought, by Anderson, but the present writer
believes by Desaguliers. Others came later, such as *Jachin and Boaz*,
the *Three Distinct Knocks*, and so forth. They had their day and ceased
to be, having now only an antiquarian interest to those who would know
the manners and customs of a far-off time. Instead of injuring the
order, they really helped it, as such things usually do, by showing that
there must be something

<span id="page_213">p. 213</span>

to expose since so many were trying to do it. But Masonry went marching
on, leaving them behind in the rubbish of things forgotten, as it does
all its back-stair spies and heel-snapping critics.

More serious by far was the series of schisms within the order which
began in 1725, and ran on even into the next century. For the student
they make the period very complex, calculated to bewilder the beginner;
for when we read of four Grand Lodges in England, and for some years all
of them running at once, and each one claiming to be the Grand Lodge of
England, the confusion seems not a little confounded. Also, one Grand
Lodge of a very limited territory, and few adherents, adopted the title
of Grand Lodge of *all* England, while another which commenced in the
middle of the century assumed the title of "The Ancients," and dubbed
the older and parent Grand Lodge "The Moderns." Besides, there are
traces of an unrecorded Grand body calling itself "The Supreme Grand
Lodge," <span id="fr_142"></span>[1](#fn_142.md) as if each were trying to
make up in name what was lacking in numbers. Strict search and due
inquiry into the causes of these divisions would seem to show the
following results:

<span id="page_214">p. 214</span>

First, there was a fear, not unjustified by facts, that the ancient
democracy of the order had been infringed upon by certain acts of the
Grand Lodge of 1717—as, for example, giving to the Grand Master power to
appoint the Wardens. <span id="fr_143"></span>[1](#fn_143.md) Second, there
was a tendency, due to the influence of some clergymen active in the
order, to give a distinctively Christian tinge to Masonry, first in
their interpretations of its symbols, and later to the ritual itself.
This fact has not been enough emphasized by our historians, for it
explains much. Third, there was the further fact that Masonry in
Scotland differed from Masonry in England, in details at least, and the
two did not all at once harmonize, each being rather tenacious of its
usage and tradition, Fourth, in one instance, if no more, pride of
locality and historic memories led to independent organization. Fifth,
there was the ever-present element of personal ambition with which all
human societies, of whatever kind, must reckon at all times and places
this side

<span id="page_215">p. 215</span>

of heaven. Altogether, the situation was amply conducive to division, if
not to explosion, and the wonder is that the schisms were so few.

#### III

Time out of mind the ancient city of York had been a seat of the Masonic
Craft, tradition tracing it back to the days of Athelstan, in 926 A. D.
Be that as it may, the Lodge minutes of York are the oldest in the
country, and the relics of the Craft now preserved in that city entitle
it to be called the Mecca of Masonry. Whether the old society was a
Private or a Grand Lodge is not plain; but in 1725 it assumed the title
of the "Grand Lodge of All England,"—feeling, it would seem, that its
inherent right by virtue of antiquity had in some way been usurped by
the Grand Lodge of London. After ten or fifteen years the minutes cease,
but the records of other grand bodies speak of it as still working. In
1761 six of its surviving members revived the Grand Lodge, which
continued with varying success until its final extinction in 1791,
having only a few subordinate Lodges, chiefly in Yorkshire. Never
antagonistic, it chose to remain independent, and its history is a noble
tradition. York Masonry was acknowledged by all parties to be both
ancient and orthodox, and even to this day, in England and over

<span id="page_216">p. 216</span>

the seas, a certain mellow, magic charm clings to the city which was for
so long a meeting place of Masons. <span id="fr_144"></span>[1](#fn_144.md)

Far more formidable was the schism of 1753, which had its origin, as is
now thought, in a group of Irish Masons in London who were not
recognized by the premier Grand Lodge. <span
id="fr_145"></span>[2](#fn_145.md) Whereupon they denounced the Grand
Lodge, averring that it had adopted "new plans" and departed from the
old landmarks, reverted, as they alleged, to the old forms, and set
themselves up as *Ancient* Masons—bestowing upon their rivals the odious
name of *Moderns*. Later the two were further distinguished from each
other by the names of their respective Grand Masters, one called Prince
of Wales' Masons, the other the Atholl Masons. <span
id="fr_146"></span>[3](#fn_146.md) The great figure in the Atholl Grand
body was Lawrence Dermott, to whose keen pen and indefatigable industry
as its secretary for more than thirty years was due, in large measure,
its success. In 1756 he published its first book of laws, entitled
*Ahiman Rezon, Or Help to a Brother*, much of which was taken from the

<span id="page_217">p. 217</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> *Irish
Constitutions* of 1751, by Pratt, and the rest from the *Book of
Constitutions*, by Anderson—whom he did not fail to criticize with
stinging satire, of which he was a master. Among other things, the
office of Deacon seems to have had its origin with this body. Atholl
Masons were presided over by the Masters of affiliated Lodges until
1756, when Lord Blessington, their first titled Grand Master, was
induced to accept the honor—their warrants having been left blank
betimes, awaiting the coming of a Nobleman to that office. Later the
fourth Duke of Atholl was Grand Master at the same time of Scotland and
of the Atholl Grand Lodge, the Grand Lodges of Scotland and Ireland
being represented at his installation in London.

Still another schism, not serious but significant, came in 1778, led by
William Preston, <span id="fr_147"></span>[1](#fn_147.md) who afterwards
became a shining light in the order. On St. John's Day, December 27,
1777, the Antiquity

<span id="page_218">p. 218</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Lodge of London,
of which Preston was Master—one of the four original Lodges forming the
Grand Lodge—attended church in a body, to hear a sermon by its Chaplain.
They robed in the vestry, and then marched into the church, but after
the service they walked back to the Hall wearing their Masonic clothing.
Difference of opinion arose as to the regularity of the act, Preston
holding it to be valid, if for no other reason, by virtue of the
inherent right of Antiquity Lodge itself. Three members objected to his
ruling and appealed to the Grand Lodge, he foolishly striking their
names off the Lodge roll for so doing. Eventually the Grand Lodge took
the matter up, decided against Preston, and ordered the reinstatement of
the three protesting members. At its next meeting the Antiquity Lodge
voted not to comply with the order of the Grand Lodge, and, instead, to
withdraw from that body and form an alliance with the "Old Grand Lodge
of All England at York City," as they called it. They were received by
the York Grand Lodge, and soon thereafter obtained a constitution for a
"Grand Lodge of England South of the Trent." Although much vitality was
shown at the outset, this body only constituted two subordinate Lodges,
and ceased to exist. Having failed, in 1789 Preston and his friends
recanted their folly, apologized to the Grand Lodge, reunited with the
men whom they had expelled, and were

<span id="page_219">p. 219</span>

received back into the fold; and so the matter ended.

These divisions, while they were in some ways unhappy, really made for
the good of the order in the sequel—the activity of contending Grand
Lodges, often keen, and at times bitter, promoting the spread of its
principles to which all were alike loyal, and to the enrichment of its
Ritual <span id="fr_148"></span>[1](#fn_148.md) to which each contributed.
Dermott, an able executive and audacious antagonist, had left no stone
unturned to advance the interests of Atholl Masonry, inducing its Grand
Lodge to grant warrants to army Lodges, which bore fruit in making
Masons in every part of the world where the English army went. <span
id="fr_149"></span>[2](#fn_149.md) Howbeit,

<span id="page_220">p. 220</span>

when that resourceful secretary and uncompromising fighter had gone to
his long rest, a better mood began to make itself felt, and a desire to
heal the feud and unite all the Grand Lodges—the way having been
cleared, meanwhile, by the demise of the old York Grand Lodge and the
"Grand Lodge South of the Trent." Overtures to that end were made in
1802 without avail, but by 1809 committees were meeting and reporting on
the "propriety and practicability of union." Fraternal letters were
exchanged, and at last a joint committee met, canvassed all differences,
and found a way to heal the schism. <span
id="fr_150"></span>[1](#fn_150.md)

<span id="page_221">p. 221</span>

Union came at length, in a great Lodge of Reconciliation held in
Freemason's Hall, London, on St. John's Day, December 27, 1813. It was a
memorable and inspiring scene as the two Grand Lodges, so long
estranged, filed into the Hall—delegates of 641 Modern and 359 Ancient
or Atholl Lodges—so mixed as to be indistinguishable the one from the
other. Both Grand Masters had seats of honor in the East. The hour was
fraternal, each side willing to sacrifice prejudice in behalf of
principles held by all in common, and all equally anxious to preserve
the ancient landmarks of the Craft—a most significant fact being that
the Atholl Masons had insisted that Masonry erase such distinctively
[Christian](errata.htm#9.md) color as had crept into it, and return to its
first platform. <span id="fr_151"></span>[1](#fn_151.md) Once united, free
of feud, cleansed of

<span id="page_222">p. 222</span>

rancor, and holding high its unsectarian, non-partisan flag, Masonry
moved forward to her great ministry. If we would learn the lesson of
those long dead schisms, we must be vigilant, correcting our judgments,
improving our regulations, and cultivating that spirit of Love which is
the fountain whence issue all our voluntary efforts for what is right
and true: union in essential matters, liberty in everything unimportant
and doubtful; Love always—one bond, one universal law, one fellowship in
spirit and in truth!

#### IV

Remains now to give a glimpse—and, alas, only a glimpse—of the growth
and influence of Masonry in America; and a great story it is, needing
many volumes to tell it aright. As we have seen, it came early to the
shores of the New World, long before the name of our great republic had
been uttered, and with its gospel of Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity
it helped to shape the institutions of this Continent. Down the Atlantic
Coast, along the Great Lakes, into the wilderness of the Middle West and
the forests of the far South—westward it

<span id="page_223">p. 223</span>

marched as "the star of empire" led, setting up its altar on .remote
frontiers, a symbol of civilization, of loyalty to law and order, of
friendship with school-house and church. If history recorded the unseen
influences which go to the making of a nation, those forces for good
which never stop, never tarry, never tire, and of which our social order
is the outward and visible sign, then might the real story of Masonry in
America be told.

Instead of a dry chronicle, <span id="fr_152"></span>[1](#fn_152.md) let us
make effort to capture and portray the spirit of Masonry in American
history, if so that all may see how this great order actually presided
over the birth of the republic, with whose growth it has had so much to
do. For example, no one need be told what patriotic memories cluster
about the old Green Dragon Tavern,

<span id="page_224">p. 224</span>

in Boston, which Webster, speaking at Andover in 1823, called "*the
headquarters of the Revolution*." Even so, but it was also a *Masonic
Hall*, in the "Long Room" of which the Grand Lodge of Massachusetts—an
off-shoot of St. Andrew's Lodge—was organized on St. John's Day, 1767,
with Joseph Warren, who afterwards fell at Bunker Hill, as Grand Master.
There Samuel Adams, Paul Revere, Warren, Hancock, Otis and others met
and passed resolutions, and then laid schemes to make them come true.
There the Boston Tea Party was planned, and executed by Masons disguised
as Mohawk Indians—not by the Lodge as such, but by a club formed within
the Lodge, calling itself the *Caucus Pro Bono Publico*, of which Warren
was the leading spirit, and in which, says Elliott, "the plans of the
Sons of Liberty were matured." As Henry Purkett used to say, he was
present at the famous Tea Party as a spectator, and in disobedience to
the order of the Master of the Lodge, who was actively present. <span
id="fr_153"></span>[1](#fn_153.md)

As in Massachusetts, so throughout the Colonies—the Masons were
everywhere active in behalf of a nation "conceived in liberty and
dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal." Of the men
who signed the Declaration of Independence, the following are known to
have been

<span id="page_225">p. 225</span>

members of the order: William Hooper, Benjamin Franklin, Matthew
Thornton, William Whipple, John Hancock, Philip Livingston, Thomas
Nelson; and no doubt others, if we had the Masonic records destroyed
during the war. Indeed, it has been said that, with four men out of the
room, the assembly could have been opened in form as a Masonic Lodge, on
the Third Degree. Not only Washington, <span
id="fr_154"></span>[1](#fn_154.md) but nearly all of his generals, were
Masons; such at least as Greene, Lee, Marion, Sullivan, Rufus and Israel
Putnam, Edwards, Jackson, Gist, Baron Steuben, Baron De Kalb, and the
Marquis de Lafayette who was made a Mason in one of the many military
Lodges held in the Continental Army. <span
id="fr_155"></span>[2](#fn_155.md) If the history of those old camp-lodges
could be written, what a story it would tell. Not only did they initiate
such men as Alexander Hamilton and John Marshall, the immortal Chief
Justice, but they made the spirit of Masonry felt in "times that try
men's souls" <span id="fr_156"></span>[3](#fn_156.md)—a spirit passing
through picket-lines, eluding sentinels, and softening the horrors of
war.

<span id="page_226">p. 226</span>

Laying aside their swords, these Masons helped to lay wide and deep the
foundations of that liberty under the law which has made this nation, of
a truth, "the last great hope of man." Nor was it an accident, but a
scene in accord with the fitness of things, that George Washington was
sworn into office as the first President of the Republic by the Grand
Master of New York, taking his oath on a Masonic Bible. It was a parable
of the whole period. If the Magna Charta demanded rights which
government can grant, Masonry from the first asserted those inalienable
rights which man derives from God the rather of men. Never did this
truth find sweeter voice than in the tones of the old Scotch fiddle on
which Robert Burns, a Master Mason, sang, in lyric glee, of the
sacredness of the soul, and the native dignity of humanity as the only
basis of society and the state. That music went marching on, striding
over continents and seas, until it found embodiment in the Constitution
and laws of this nation, where today more than a million Masons are
citizens.

How strange, then, that Masonry should have been made the victim of the
most bitter and baseless persecution, for it was nothing else, in the
annals

<span id="page_227">p. 227</span>

of the Republic. Yet so it came to pass between 1826 and 1845, in
connection with the Morgan <span id="fr_157"></span>[1](#fn_157.md) affair,
of which so much has been written, and so little truth told. Alas, it
was an evil hour when, as Galsworthy would say, "men just feel something
big and religious, and go blind to justice, fact, and reason." Although
Lodges everywhere repudiated and denounced the crime, if crime it was,
and the Governor of New York, himself a Mason, made every effort to
detect and punish those involved, the fanaticism

<span id="page_228">p. 228</span>

would not be stayed: the mob-mood ruled. An Anti-Masonic political
party <span id="fr_158"></span>[1](#fn_158.md) was formed, fed on frenzy,
and the land was stirred from end to end. Even such a man as John Quincy
Adams, of great credulity and strong prejudice, was drawn into the fray,
and in a series of letters flayed Masonry as an enemy of society and a
free state—forgetting that Washington, Franklin, Marshall, and Warren
were members of the order! Meanwhile—and, verily, it was a mean
while—Weed, Seward, Thaddeus Stevens, and others of their ilk, rode into
power on the strength of it, as they had planned to do, defeating Henry
Clay for President, because he was a Mason—and, incidentally, electing
Andrew Jackson, another Mason! Let it be said that, if the Masons found
it hard to keep within the Compass, they at least acted on the Square.
Finally the fury spent itself, leaving the order purged of feeble men
who were Masons only in form, and a revival of Masonry followed, slowly
at first, and then with great rapidity.

No sooner had Masonry recovered from this or-deal than the dark clouds
of Civil War covered the land like a pall—the saddest of all wars,
dividing a nation one in arts and arms and historic memories,

<span id="page_229">p. 229</span>

and leaving an entail of blood and fire and tears. Let it be forever
[remembered](errata.htm#10.md) that, while churches were severed and states
were seceding, *the Masonic order remained unbroken* in that wild and
fateful hour. An effort was made to involve Masonry in the strife, but
the wise counsel of its leaders, North and South, prevented the mixing
of Masonry with politics; and while it could not avert the tragedy, it
did much to mitigate the woe of it—building rainbow bridges of mercy and
goodwill from army to army. Though passion may have strained, it could
not break the tie of Masonic love, which found a ministry on red fields,
among the sick, the wounded, and those in prison; and many a man in gray
planted a Sprig of Acacia on the grave of a man who wore the blue. Some
day the writer hopes to tell that story, or a part of it, and then men
will under-stand what Masonry is, what it means, and what it can do to
heal the hurts of humanity. <span id="fr_159"></span>[1](#fn_159.md)

<span id="page_230">p. 230</span>

Even so it has been, all through our national history, and today Masonry
is worth more for the sanctity and safety of this republic than both its
army and its navy. At every turn of events, when the rights of man have
been threatened by enemies obvious or insidious, it has stood guard—its
altar lights like signal fires along the heights of liberty, keeping
watch. Not only in our own land, but everywhere over the broad earth,
when men have thrown off the yoke of tyranny, whether political or
spiritual, and demanded the rights that belong to manhood, they have
found a friend in the Masonic order—as did Mazzini and Garibaldi in
Italy. Nor must we be less alert and vigilant today when, free of danger
of foes from without, our republic is imperiled by the negligence of
indifference, the seduction of luxury, the machinations of politicians,
and the shadow of a passion-clouded, impatient discontent, whose end is
madness and folly; lest the most hallowed of all liberties be lost.

Truly, the very existence of such a great historic fellowship in the
quest and service of the Ideal is a fact eloquent beyond all words, and
to be counted among the precious assets of humanity. Forming one vast
society of free men, held together by voluntary obligations, it covers
the whole globe from Egypt to India, from Italy to England, from America
to Australia, and the isles of the sea; from London to Sidney, from
Chicago to Calcutta. In all civilized lands, and among folk of every
creed worthy of the name, Masonry is found—and everywhere it upholds all
the redeeming ideals of humanity, making all good things better by its
presence, like a stream underflowing a meadow. <span
id="fr_160"></span>[1](#fn_160.md) Also, wherever Masonry flourishes and is
allowed to build freely after its divine design, liberty, justice,
education, and true religion flourish; and where it is hindered, they
suffer. Indeed, he who would reckon the spiritual possessions of the
race, and estimate the forces that make for social beauty, national
greatness, and human welfare, must take account of the genius of

<span id="page_232">p. 232</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Masonry and its
ministry to the higher life of the race.

Small wonder that such an order has won to its fellowship men of the
first order of intellect, men of thought and action in many lands, and
every walk and work of life: soldiers like Wellington, Blucher, and
Garibaldi; philosophers like Krause, Fichte, and John Locke; patriots
like Washington and Mazzini; writers like Walter Scott, Voltaire,
Steele, Lessing, Tolstoi; poets like Goethe, Burns, Byron, Kipling,
Pike; musicians like Haydn and Mozart—whose opera, *The Magic Flute*,
has a Masonic motif; masters of drama like Forrest and Edwin Booth;
editors such as Bowles, Prentice, Childs, Grady; ministers of many
communions, from Bishop Potter to Robert Collyer; statesmen,
philanthropists, educators, jurists, men of science—Masons many, <span
id="fr_161"></span>[1](#fn_161.md) whose names shine like stars in the
great world's crown of intellectual

<span id="page_233">p. 233</span>

and spiritual glory. What other order has ever brought together men of
such diverse type, temper, training, interest, and achievement, uniting
them at an altar of prayer in the worship of God and the service of man?

For the rest, if by some art one could trace those invisible influences
which move to and fro like shuttles in a loom, weaving the network of
laws, reverences, sanctities which make the warp and woof of
society—giving to statutes their dignity and power, to the gospel its
opportunity, to the home its canopy of peace and beauty, to the young an
enshrinement of inspiration, and to the old a mantle of protection; if
one had such art, then he might tell the true story of Masonry. Older
than any living religion, the most widespread of all orders of men, it
toils for liberty, friendship, and righteousness; binding men with
solemn vows to the right, uniting them upon the only basis upon which
they can meet without reproach—like those fibers running through the
glaciers, along which sunbeams journey, melting the frozen mass and
sending it to the valleys

<span id="page_234">p. 234</span>

below in streams of blessing. Other fibers are there, but none is more
far-ramifying, none more tender, none more responsive to the Light than
the mystical tie of Masonic love.

Truth will triumph. Justice will yet reign from sun to sun, victorious
over cruelty and evil. Finally Love will rule the race, casting out
fear, hatred, and all unkindness, and pity will heal the old hurt and
heart-ache of humanity. There is nothing in history, dark as much of it
is, against the ultimate fulfilment of the prophetic vision of Robert
Burns—the Poet Laureate of Masonry:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Then let us pray, that come it may—  
As come it will, for a' that—  
.  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .

Shall brothers be, for a' that.</span>

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_132"></span>[201:1](bui12.htm#fr_132.md) Operative Masonry, it
should be remembered, was not entirely dead, nor did it all at once
disappear. Indeed, it still exists in some form, and an interesting
account of its forms, degrees, symbols, usages, and traditions may be
found in an article on "Operative Masonry," by C. F. Stretton
(*Transactions Leicester Lodge of Research*, 1909-10, 1911-12). The
second of these volumes also contains an essay on "Operative
Free-masons," by Thomas Carr, with a list of lodges, and a study of
their history, customs, and emblems—especially the Swastika. Speculative
Masons are now said to be joining these Operative Lodges, seeking more
light on what are called the Lost Symbols of Masonry.

<span id="fn_133"></span>[205:1](bui12.htm#fr_133.md) The Grand Lodges of
Ireland and Scotland, it may be added, were self-constituted, without
assistance or intervention from England in any form.

<span id="fn_134"></span>[205:2](bui12.htm#fr_134.md) A deputation of the
Hamburg Lodge initiated Frederick—afterwards Frederick the Great of
Prussia—into the order of Masons at Brunswick, August 14, 1738
(*Frederick and his Times*, by Campbell, *History of Frederick*, by
Carlyle, Findel's *History of Masonry*). Other noblemen followed his
example, and their zeal for the order gave a new date to the history of
Masonry in Germany. When Frederick ascended the throne, in 1740, the
Craft was honored, and it flourished in his kingdom. As to the interest
of Frederick in the order in his later years, the facts are not clear,
but that he remained its friend seems certain (Mackey, *Encyclopedia*).
However, the Craft underwent many vicissitudes in Germany, a detailed
account of which Findel recites (*History of Masonry*). Few realize
through what frightful persecutions Masonry has passed in many lands,
owing in part to its secrecy, but in larger part to its principle of
civil and religious liberty. Whenever that story is told, as it surely
will be, men everywhere will pay homage to the Ancient Free and Accepted
Masons as friends of mankind.

<span id="fn_135"></span>[206:1](bui12.htm#fr_135.md) This letter was the
property of Horace W. Smith, Philadelphia. John Moore was the father of
William Moore, whose daughter became the wife of Provost Smith, who was
a Mason in 1775, and afterward Grand Secretary of the Grand Lodge of
Pennsylvania, and whose son was Grand Master of Masons in Pennsylvania
in 1796 and 1797 (*History of Freemasonry*, by Hughan and Stillson).

<span id="fn_136"></span>[206:2](bui12.htm#fr_136.md) *Ibid*, chapter on
"Early American Masonic History."

<span id="fn_137"></span>[207:1](bui12.htm#fr_137.md) *Benjamin Franklin as
a Free Mason*, by J. F. Sachse. Oddly enough, there is no mention of
Masonry by Franklin in his *Autobiography*, or in any of his letters,
with but two exceptions, so far as known; which is the more remarkable
when we look at his Masonic career in France during the later years of
his life, where he was actively and intimately associated with the
order, even advancing to the higher degrees. Never for a day did he
abate by one jot his interest in the order, or his love for it.

<span id="fn_138"></span>[209:1](bui12.htm#fr_138.md) This injunction was
made doubly strong in the edition of the *Book of Constitutions*, in
1738. For example: "no quarrels about nations, families, religion or
politics must by any means or under any color or pretense whatever be
brought within the door of the Lodge . . . Masons being of all nations
upon the square, level and plumb; and like our predecessors in all ages,
we are resolved against political disputes," etc.

<span id="fn_139"></span>[210:1](bui12.htm#fr_139.md) Masons have sometimes
been absurdly called "Protestant Jesuits," but the two orders are
exactly opposite in spirit, principle, purpose, and method. All that
they have in common is that they are both secret societies, which makes
it plain that the opposition of the Latin church to Masonry is not on
the ground of its being a secret <span id="page_211">p. 211</span>
order, else why sanction the Jesuits, to name no other? The difference
has been stated in this way: "Opposite poles these two societies are,
for each possesses precisely those qualities which the other lacks. The
Jesuits are strongly centralized, the Freemasons only con-federated.
Jesuits are controlled by one man's will, Freemasons are under majority
rule. Jesuits bottom morality in expediency, Freemasons in regard for
the well-being of mankind. Jesuits recognize only one creed, Freemasons
hold in respect all honest convictions. Jesuits seek to break down
individual independence, Freemasons to build it up" (*Mysteria*, by Otto
Henne Am Rhyn).

<span id="fn_140"></span>[211:1](bui12.htm#fr_140.md) For a detailed
account of the Duke of Wharton and the true history of the Gormogons,
see an essay by R. F. Gould, in his "Masonic Celebrities" series (*A. Q.
C.*, viii, 144), and more recently, *The Life and Writings of Philip,
Duke of Wharton*, by Lewis Melville.

<span id="fn_141"></span>[212:1](bui12.htm#fr_141.md) Findel has a nobly
eloquent passage on this point, and it tells the everlasting truth
(History of Masonry, p. 378). His whole history, indeed, is exceedingly
worth reading, the more so because it was one of the first books of the
right kind, and it stimulated research.

<span id="fn_142"></span>[213:1](bui12.htm#fr_142.md) A paper entitled "An
Unrecorded Grand Lodge," by Sadler (*A. Q. C.*, vol. xviii, 69-90),
tells practically all that is known of this movement, which merged with
the Grand Lodge of London in 1776.

<span id="fn_143"></span>[214:1](bui12.htm#fr_143.md) Nor was that all. In
1735 it was resolved in the Grand Lodge "that in the future all Grand
Officers (except Grand Master) shall be selected out of that
body"—meaning the past Grand Stewards. This act was amazing. Already the
Craft had let go its power to elect the Wardens, and now the choice of
the Grand Master was narrowed to the ranks of an oligarchy in its worst
form—a queer outcome of Masonic equality. Three months later the Grand
Stewards presented a memorial asking that they "might form themselves
into a special lodge," with special jewels, etc. Naturally this bred
discontent and apprehension, and justly so.

<span id="fn_144"></span>[216:1](bui12.htm#fr_144.md) Often we speak of
"the York Rite," as though it were the oldest and truest form of
Masonry, but, while it serves to distinguish one branch of Masonry from
another, it is not accurate; for, strictly speaking, there is no such
thing as a York Rite. The name is more a tribute of reverence than a
description of fact.

<span id="fn_145"></span>[216:2](bui12.htm#fr_145.md) *Masonic Facts and
Fictions*, by Henry Sadler.

<span id="fn_146"></span>[216:3](bui12.htm#fr_146.md) *Atholl Lodges*, by
R. F. Gould.

<span id="fn_147"></span>[217:1](bui12.htm#fr_147.md) William Preston was
born in Edinburgh in 1742, and came as a journeyman printer to London in
1760, where he made himself conversant with the history, laws, and rites
of the Craft, being much in demand as a lecturer. He was a good speaker,
and frequently addressed the Lodges of the city. After his blunder of
seceding had been forgiven, he was honored with many offices, especially
the Grand Secretaryship, which gave him time to pursue his studies.
Later he wrote the *Freemason's Callender*, an appendix to the *Book of
Constitutions*, a *History of Masonry*, and, most famous of all,
*Illustrations of Masonry*, which passed through a score of editions.
Besides, he had much to do with the development of the Ritual.

<span id="fn_148"></span>[219:1](bui12.htm#fr_148.md) The history of the
Ritual is most interesting, and should be written in more detail
(*History of Masonry*, by Steinbrenner, chap. vii, "The Ritual"). An
article giving a brief story of it appeared in the *Masonic Monthly*, of
Boston, November, 1863 (reprinted in the *New England Craftsman*, vol.
vii, and still later in the *Bulletin of Iowa Masonic Library*, vol. xv,
April, 1914). This article is valuable as showing the growth of the
Ritual—as much by subtraction as by addition—and especially the
introduction into it of Christian imagery and interpretation, first by
Martin Clare in 1732, and by Duckerley and Hutchinson later. One need
only turn to *The Spirit of Masonry*, by Hutchinson (1802), to see how
far this tendency had gone when at last checked in 1813. At that time a
committee made a careful comparative study of all rituals in use among
Masons, and the ultimate result was the Preston-Webb lectures now
generally in use in this country. (See a valuable article by Dr. Mackey
on "The Lectures of Freemasonry," *American Quarterly Review of
Freemasonry*, vol. ii, p. 297.) What a pity that this *Review* died of
too much excellence!

<span id="fn_149"></span>[219:2](bui12.htm#fr_149.md) *Military Lodges*, by
Gould; also Kipling's poem, *The Mother Lodge*.

<span id="fn_150"></span>[220:1](bui12.htm#fr_150.md) Among the articles of
union, it was agreed that Freemasonry should consist of the three
symbolic degrees, "*including the Holy Royal Arch*." The present study
does not contemplate a detailed study of Capitular Masonry, which has
its own history and historians (*Origin of the English Rite*, Hughan),
except to say that it seems to have begun about 1738-40, the
[consensus](errata.htm#8.md) of opinion differing as to whether it began in
England or on the Continent ("Royal Arch Masonry," by C. P. Noar,
*Manchester Lodge of Research*, vol. iii, 1911-12). Lawrence Dermott,
always alert, had it adopted by the Atholl Grand Lodge about thirty
years before the Grand Lodge of England took it up in 1770-76, when
Thomas Duckerley was appointed to arrange and introduce it. Dermott held
it to be "the very essence of Masonry," and he was not slow in using it
as a club with which to belabor the Moderns; but he did not originate
it, as some imagine, having received the degrees before he came to
London, perhaps in an unsystemized form. Duckerley was accused of
shifting the original Grand Masonic word from the Third Degree to the
Royal Arch, and of substituting another in its stead. Enough to say that
Royal Arch Masonry is [p. 221](#page_221.md) authentic Masonry, being a
further elaboration in drama, following the Third Degree, of the spirit
and motif of old Craft Masonry (*History of Freemasonry and Concordant
Orders*, by Hughan and Stillson).

<span id="fn_151"></span>[221:1](bui12.htm#fr_151.md) It is interesting to
note that the writer of the article on "Masonry" in the *Catholic
Encyclopedia*—an article admirable in many ways, and for the most part
fair—makes much of this point, and rightly so, albeit his interpretation
of it is altogether wrong. He imagines that the objection to Christian
imagery in the ritual was due to enmity to Christianity. Not so. Masonry
was not then, and has never at any time been, opposed to Christianity,
or to any other religion. Far from it. But Christianity in those
days—as, alas, too often now—was another name for a petty and bigoted
sectarianism; and Masonry by its very genius was, and is, unsectarian.
Many Masons then were devout Christians, as they are <span
id="page_222">p. 222</span> now—not a few clergymen—but the order itself
is open to men of all faiths, Catholic and Protestant, Hebrew and Hindu,
who confess faith in God; and so it will always remain if it is true to
its principles and history.

<span id="fn_152"></span>[223:1](bui12.htm#fr_152.md) As for the chronicle,
the one indispensable book to the student of American Masonry is the
*History of Freemasonry and Concordant Orders*, by W. J. Hughan and H.
L. Stillson, aided by one of the ablest board of contributors ever
assembled. It includes a history of Masonry in all its Rites in North,
Central, and South America, with accurate accounts of the origin and
growth of every Grand Lodge in the United States and British America;
also admirable chapters on Early American Masonic History, the Morgan
Excitement, Masonic Jurisprudence, and statistics up to date of 1891—all
carefully prepared and well written. Among other books too many to name,
there are the *History of Symbolic Masonry* in the United States, by J.
H. Drummond, and "The American Addenda" to Gould's massive and
magnificent *History of Masonry*, vol. iv. What the present pages seek
is the spirit behind this forest of facts.

<span id="fn_153"></span>[224:1](bui12.htm#fr_153.md) For the full story,
see "Reminiscences of the Green Dragon Tavern," in *Centennial Memorial
of St. Andrew's Lodge*, 1870.

<span id="fn_154"></span>[225:1](bui12.htm#fr_154.md) *Washington, the Man
and the Mason*, by C. H. Callahan. Jackson, Polk, Fillmore, Buchanan,
Johnson, Garfield, McKinley, Roosevelt, Taft, all were Masons. A long
list may be found in *Cyclopedia of Fraternities*, by Stevens, article
on "Freemasonry: Distinguished Americans."

<span id="fn_155"></span>[225:2](bui12.htm#fr_155.md) *Washington and his
Masonic Compeers*, by Randolph Hayden.

<span id="fn_156"></span>[225:3](bui12.htm#fr_156.md) Thomas Paine, whose
words these are, though not a Mason, has left us an essay on *The Origin
of Freemasonry*. Few men have ever been more unjustly and cruelly
maligned than this great patriot, who was the first to utter the name
"United States," and who, instead <span id="page_226">p. 226</span> of
being a sceptic, believed in "the religion in which all men agree"—that
is, in God, Duty, and the immortality of the soul.

<span id="fn_157"></span>[227:1](bui12.htm#fr_157.md) William Morgan was a
dissolute, nondescript printer in Batavia, New York, who, having failed
in everything else, thought to make money by betraying the secrets of an
order which his presence polluted. Foolishly misled, a few Masons had
him arrested on a petty charge, got him out of the country, and
apparently paid him to stay out. Had no attention been paid to his
alleged exposure it would have fallen still-born from the press, like
many another before it. Rumors of abduction started, then Morgan was
said to have been thrown into Niagara River, whereas there is no proof
that he was ever killed, much less murdered by Masons. Thurlow Weed and
a pack of unscrupulous politicians took it up, and the rest was easy.
One year later a body was found on the shore of Lake Ontario which Weed
and the wife of Morgan identified—a *year afterward*!—she, no doubt,
having been paid to do so; albeit the wife of a fisherman named Munroe
identified the same body as that of her husband drowned a week or so
before. No matter; as Weed said, "*It's good enough Morgan until after
the election*"—a characteristic remark, if we may judge by his own
portrait as drawn in his *Autobiography*. Politically, he was capable of
anything, if he could make it win, and here he saw a chance of stirring
up every vile and slimy thing in human nature for sake of office. (See a
splendid review of the whole matter in *History of Masonry*, by Hughan
and Stillson, also by Could in vol. iv of his *History*.)

<span id="fn_158"></span>[228:1](bui12.htm#fr_158.md) *Cyclopedia of
Fraternities*, by Stevens, article, "Anti-Masonry," gives detailed
account with many interesting facts.

<span id="fn_159"></span>[229:1](bui12.htm#fr_159.md) Following the first
day of the battle of Gettysburg, there was a Lodge meeting in town, and
"Yanks" and "Johnny Rebs" met and mingled as friends under the Square
and Compass. Where else could they have done so? (*Tennessee Mason*).
When the Union army attacked Little Rock, Ark., the commanding officer,
Thomas H. Benton—Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of Iowa—threw a guard
about the home of General Albert Pike, to *protect his Masonic library*.
Marching through burning Richmond, a Union officer saw the familiar
emblems over a hall. He put a guard about the Lodge room, and that
night, together with a number of Confederate Masons, organized a society
for the relief of widows and <span id="page_230">p. 230</span> orphans
left destitute by the war (*Washington, the Man and the Mason*,
Callahan). But for the kindness of a brother Mason, who saved the life
of a young soldier of the South, who was a prisoner of war at Rock
Island, Ill., the present writer would never have been born, much less
have written this book. That young soldier was my father! Volumes of
such facts might be gathered in proof of the gracious ministry of
Masonry in those awful years.

<span id="fn_160"></span>[231:1](bui12.htm#fr_160.md) *Cyclopedia of
Fraternities*, by Stevens (last edition), article, "Free Masonry,"
pictures the extent of the order, with maps and diagrams showing its
world-wide influence.

<span id="fn_161"></span>[232:1](bui12.htm#fr_161.md) Space does not permit
a survey of the literature of Masonry, still less of Masonry in
literature. (Findel has two fine chapters on the literature of the
order, but he wrote, in 1865, *History of Masonry*.) For traces of
Masonry in literature, there is the famous chapter in *War and Peace*,
by Tolstoi; *Mon Oncle Sosthenes*, by Maupassant; *Nathan the Wise*, and
*Ernest and Falk*, by Lessing; the Masonic poems of Goethe, and many
hints in *Wilhelm Meister*; the writings of Herder (*Classic Period of
German Letters*, Findel), *The Lost Word*, by Henry Van Dyke; and, of
course, the poetry of Burns.

Masonic phrases and allusions—often almost too revealing—are found all
through the poems and stories of Kipling. Besides <span id="page_233">p.
233</span> the poem *The Mother Lodge*, so much admired, there is *The
Widow of Windsor*, such stories as *With the Main Guard*, *The Winged
Hats*, *Hal o’ the Draft*, *The City Walls*, *On the Great Wall*, many
examples in *Kim*, also in *Traffics and Discoveries*, *Puck of Pook's
Hill*, and, by no means least, *The Man Who Would be King*, one of the
great short stories of the world.
