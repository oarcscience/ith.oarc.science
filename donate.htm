<P>
Okay, listen up. It's not cheap running a site like this.
In fact you could buy a new luxury car outright for what it costs yearly to run
sacred-texts.
Instead we walk everywhere...
</P>
<P>
Mostly, the <A HREF="index.htm">Intangible Textual Heritage Disk</A>
pays the bills around here, and to a lesser extent, advertising
provided by Amazon and Google.
We typically get less than a $100 a year in donations.
That's all right, because this isn't a formal non-profit organization,
even though it <I>does</I> have an altruistic mission.
</P>

<P>
If you <I>do</I> want to give us money out of the kindness of your heart,
that's great.
</P>

<P><I>Please note that donations are non-refundable, and not tax deductable.</I></P>

<P>We suggest a minimum donation of $10. You can make a PayPal donation
using your credit card or checking account.</P>

<P>To donate, please press the button above.</P>
