### CHAPTER XI.

> "Not to commit any sin, to do good, and to purify one's mind, that is
> the teaching of the Awakened. . . .

> "Better than Sovereignty over the earth, better than going to heaven,
> better than lordship over all the worlds is the reward of the first
> step in holiness."--*Dhammapada*, verses 178-183.

> "Creator, where are these tribunals, where do these courts proceed,
> where do these courts assemble, where do the tribunals meet to which
> the man of the embodied world gives an account for his
> soul?"--*Persian Vendidad,* xix. 89.

> "Hail to thee O Man, who art come from the transitory place to the
> imperishable!"--*Vendidad,* farg. vii., 136.

> "To the true believer, truth, wherever it appears, is welcome, nor
> will any doctrine seem the less true or the less precious, because it
> was seen not only by Moses or Christ, but likewise by Buddha or
> Lao-tse."--**M**AX **M**ULLER.

UNLUCKILY for those who would have been glad to render justice to the
ancient and modern religious philosophies of the Orient, a fair
opportunity has hardly ever been given to them. Of late there has been a
touching accord between philologists holding high official positions,
and missionaries from heathen lands. Prudence before truth when the
latter endangers our sinecures! Besides, how easy to compromise with
conscience. A State religion is a prop of government; all State
religions are "exploded humbugs"; therefore, since one is as good, or
rather as bad, as another, *the* State religion may as well be
supported. Such is the diplomacy of official science.

Grote in his *History of Greece,* assimilates the Pythagoreans to the
Jesuits, and sees in their Brotherhood but an ably-disguised object to
acquire political ascendancy. On the loose testimony of Herakleitus and
some other writers, who accused Pythagoras of craft, and described him
as a man "of extensive research . . . but artful for mischief and
destitute of sound judgment," some historical biographers hastened to
present him to posterity in such a character.

How then if they must accept the Pythagoras painted by the satirical
Timon: "a juggler of solemn speech engaged in fishing for men," can they
avoid judging of Jesus from the sketch that Celsus has embalmed in his
satire? Historical impartiality has nought to do with creeds and
personal beliefs, and exacts as much of posterity for one as for the
other. The life and doings of Jesus are far less attested than

###### <span id="page_530">p. 530</span>

those of Pythagoras, if, indeed, we can say that they are attested at
all by any *historical* proof. For assuredly no one will gainsay that as
a real personage Celsus has the advantage as regards the credibility of
his testimony over Matthew, or Mark, or Luke, or John, who never wrote a
line of the *Gospels* attributed to them respectively. Withal Celsus is
at least as good a witness as Herakleitus. He was known as a scholar and
a Neo-platonist to some of the Fathers; whereas the very existence of
the four Apostles must be taken on blind faith. If Timon regarded the
sublime Samian as "a juggler," so did Celsus hold Jesus, or rather those
who made all the pretenses for him. In his famous work, addressing the
Nazarene, he says: "Let us grant that the wonders were performed by you
. . . but are they not common with those who have been taught by the
Egyptians to perform in the middle of the forum for a few oboli." And we
know, on the authority of the *Gospel according to Matthew,* that the
Galilean prophet was also a man of solemn speech, and that he called
himself and offered to make his disciples "fishers of men."

Let it not be imagined that we bring this reproach to any who revere
Jesus as God. Whatever the faith, if the worshipper be but sincere, it
should be respected in his presence. If we do not accept Jesus as God,
we revere *him as a man.* Such a feeling honors him more than if we were
to attribute to him the powers and personality of the Supreme, and
credit him at the same time with having played a useless comedy with
mankind, as, after all, his mission proves scarcely less than a complete
failure; 2,000 years have passed, and Christians do not reckon one-fifth
part of the population of the globe, nor is Christianity likely to
progress any better in the future. No, we aim but at strict justice,
leaving all personality aside. We question those who, adoring neither
Jesus, Pythagoras, nor Apollonius, yet recite the idle gossip of their
contemporaries; those who in their books either maintain a prudent
silence, or speak of "our Saviour" and "our Lord," as though they
believed any more in the made-up theological Christ, than in the
fabulous Fo of China.

There were no Atheists in those days of old; no disbelievers or
materialists, in the modern sense of the word, as there were no bigoted
detractors. He who judges the ancient philosophies by their external
phraseology, and quotes from ancient writings sentences *seemingly*
atheistical, is unfit to be trusted as a critic, for he is unable to
penetrate into the inner sense of their metaphysics. The views of
Pyrrho, whose rationalism has become proverbial, can be interpreted only
by the light of the oldest Hindu philosophy. From Manu down to the
latest Swabhavika, its leading metaphysical feature ever was to proclaim
the reality and supremacy of spirit, with a vehemence proportionate to
the denial of the objective existence of our material world--passing
phantom of

###### <span id="page_531">p. 531</span>

temporary forms and beings. The numerous schools begotten by Kapila,
reflect his philosophy no clearer than the doctrines left as a legacy to
thinkers by Timon, Pyrrho's "Prophet," as Sextus Empiricus calls him.
His views on the divine repose of the soul, his proud indifference to
the opinion of his fellow men, his contempt for sophistry, reflect in an
equal degree stray beams of the self-contemplation of the Gymnosophists
and of the Buddhist *Vaibhashika.* Notwithstanding that he and his
followers are termed, from their state of constant suspense, "skeptics,"
"doubters," inquirers, and ephectics, only because they postponed their
final judgment on dilemmas, with which our modern philosophers prefer
dealing, Alexander-like, by cutting the Gordian knot, and then declaring
the dilemma a superstition, such men as Pyrrho cannot be pronounced
atheists. No more can Kapila, or Giordano Bruno, or again Spinoza, who
were also treated as atheists; nor yet, the great Hindu poet,
philosopher, and dialectician, Veda-Vyasa, whose principle that all is
illusion--save the Great Unknown and His direct essence--Pyrrho has
adopted in full.

These philosophical beliefs extended like a net-work over the whole
pre-Christian world; and, surviving persecution and misrepresentations,
form the corner-stone of every now existing religion outside
Christianity.

Comparative theology is a two-edged weapon, and has so proved itself.
But the Christian advocates, unabashed by evidence, force comparison in
the serenest way; Christian legends and dogmas, they say, do somewhat
resemble the heathen, it is true; but see, while the one teaches us the
existence, powers, and attributes of an all-wise, all-good Father-God,
Brahmanism gives us a multitude of minor gods, and Buddhism none
whatever; one is fetishism and polytheism, the other bald atheism.
Jehovah is the one true God, and the Pope and Martin Luther are His
prophets! This is one edge of the sword, and this the other: Despite
missions, despite armies, despite enforced commercial intercourse, the
"heathen" find nothing in the teachings of Jesus--sublime though some
are--that Christna and Gautama had not taught them before. And so, to
gain over any new converts, and keep the few already won by centuries of
cunning, the Christians give the "heathen" dogmas more absurd than their
own, and cheat them by adopting the habit of their native priests, and
practicing the very "idolatry and fetishism" which they so disparage in
the "heathens." Comparative theology works both ways.

In Siam and Burmah, Catholic missionaries have become perfect Talapoins
to all external appearance, *i.e*., minus their virtues; and throughout
India, especially in the south, they were denounced by their

###### <span id="page_532">p. 532</span>

own colleague, the Abbe Dubois. <span id="fr_1038"></span>[\*](#fn_1037)
This was afterward vehemently denied. But now we have living witnesses
to the correctness of the charge. Among others, Captain O'Grady, already
quoted, a native of Madras, writes the following on this systematic
method of deception: <span id="fr_1039"></span>[\*\*](#fn_1038) "The
hypocritical beggars profess total abstinence and horror of flesh to
conciliate converts from Hinduism. . . . I got one father, or rather, he
got himself gloriously drunk in my house, time and again, and the way he
pitched into roast beef was a caution." Further, the author has pretty
stories to tell of "black-faced Christs," "Virgins on wheels," and of
Catholic processions in general. We have seen such solemn ceremonies
accompanied by the most infernal cacophony of a Cingalese orchestra,
tam-tam and gongs included, followed by a like Brahmanic procession,
which, for its picturesque coloring and *mise en scene,* looked far more
solemn and imposing than the Christian saturnalias. Speaking of one of
these, the same author remarks: "It was more devilish than religious. .
. . The bishops walked off Romeward, <span
id="fr_1040"></span>[\*\*\*](#fn_1039) with a mighty pile of Peter's
pence gathered in the minutest sums, with gold ornaments, nose-rings,
anklets, elbow bangles, etc., etc., in profusion, recklessly thrown in
heaps at the feet of the grotesque copper-colored image of the Saviour,
with its Dutch metal halo and gaudily-striped cummerbund and--shade of
Raphael!--blue turban." <span id="fr_1041"></span>[\*\*\*\*](#fn_1040)

As every one can see, such voluntary contributions make it quite
profitable to mimic the native Brahmans and bonzes. Between the
worshippers of Christna and Christ, or Avany and the Virgin Mary, there
is less substantial difference, in fact, than between the two native
sects, the Vishnavites and the Sivites. For the *converted* Hindus,
Christ is a slightly modified Christna, that is all. Missionaries carry
away rich donations and Rome is satisfied. Then comes a year of famine;
but the nose-rings and gold elbow-bangles are gone and people starve by
thousands. What matters it? They die in Christ, and Rome scatters her
blessings over their corpses, of which thousands float yearly down the
sacred rivers to the ocean. <span
id="fr_1042"></span>[\*\*\*\*\*](#fn_1041) So servile are the Catholics
in their imita-

<span id="page_533">p. 533</span>

tion, and so careful not to give offense to their parishioners, that if
they happen to have a few higher caste converts in a Church, no pariah
nor any man of the lower castes, however good a Christian he may be, can
be admitted into the same Church with them. And yet they dare call
themselves the servants of Him who sought in preference the society of
the publicans and sinners; and whose appeal--"Come unto me all ye that
are heavy laden, and I will give you rest" has opened to him the hearts
of millions of the suffering and the oppressed!

Few writers are as bold and outspoken as the late lamented Dr. Thomas
Inman, of Liverpool, England. But however small their number, these men
all agree unanimously, that the philosophy of both Buddhism and
Brahmanism must rank higher than Christian theology, and teach neither
atheism or fetishism. "To my own mind," says Inman, "the assertion that
Sakya did not believe in God is wholly unsupported. Nay, his whole
scheme is built upon the belief that there are powers above which are
capable of punishing mankind for their sins. It is true that these gods
were not called Elohim, nor Jah, nor Jehovah, nor Jahveh, nor Adonai,
nor Ehieh, nor Baalim, nor Ashtoreth--yet, for the son of Suddhadana,
there was a Supreme Being." <span id="fr_1043"></span>[\*](#fn_1042)

There are four schools of Buddhist theology, in Ceylon, Thibet, and
India. One is rather pantheistical than atheistical, but the other three
are purely

theistical.

On the first the speculations of our philologists are based. As to the
second, third, and the fourth, their teachings vary but in the external
mode of expression. We have fully explained the spirit of it elsewhere.

As to practical, not theoretical views on the Nirvana, this is what a
rationalist and a skeptic says: "I have questioned at the very doors of
their temples several hundreds of Buddhists, and have not found one but
strove, fasted, and gave himself up to every kind of austerity, to
perfect himself and acquire immortality; not to attain final
annihilation.

"There are over 300,000,000 of Buddhists who fast, pray, and toil. . . .
Why make of these 300,000,000 of men idiots and fools, macerating their
bodies and imposing upon themselves most fearful privations of every
nature, in order to reach a fatal annihilation which must overtake them
anyhow?" <span id="fr_1044"></span>[\*\*](#fn_1043)

As well as this author we have questioned Buddhists and Brahmanists and
studied their philosophy. *Apavarg* has wholly a different meaning

###### <span id="page_534">p. 534</span>

from annihilation. It is but to become more and more like Him, of whom
he is one of the refulgent sparks, that is the aspiration of every Hindu
philosopher and the hope of the most ignorant is *never to yield up his
distinct individuality.* "Else," as once remarked an esteemed
correspondent of the author, "mundane and separate existence would look
like God's comedy and our tragedy; sport to Him that we work and suffer,
death to us to suffer it."

The same with the doctrine of metempsychosis, so distorted by European
scholars. But as the work of translation and analysis progresses, fresh
religious beauties will be discovered in the old faiths.

Professor Whitney has in his translation of the *Vedas* passages in
which he says, the assumed importance of the body to its old tenant is
brought out in the strongest light. These are portions of hymns read at
the funeral services, over the body of the departed one. We quote them
from Mr. Whitney's scholarly work:

> "Start onward! bring together all thy members;  
> let not thy limbs be left, nor yet thy body;  
> Thy spirit gone before, now follow after;  
> Wherever it delights thee, go thou thither.  
> . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  
> Collect thy body; with its every member;  
> thy limbs with help of rites I fashion for thee.  
> . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  
> If some one limb was left behind by Agni,  
> When to thy Fathers' world he hence conveyed you,  
> That very one I now again supply you;  
> rejoice in heaven with all your limbs, ye Fathers!" <span
> id="fr_1045"></span>[\*](#fn_1044)

The "body" here referred to is not the physical, but the *astral*
one*--*a very great distinction, as may be seen.

Again, belief in the individual existence of the immortal spirit of man
is shown in the following verses of the Hindu ceremonial of incremation
and burial.

> "They who within the sphere of earth are stationed,  
> or who are settled now in realms of pleasure,  
> The Fathers who have the earth--the atmosphere--the heaven for their
> seat,  
> The 'fore-heaven' the third heaven is styled,  
> and where the Fathers have their seat."--(*Rig-Veda,* x.)

With such majestic views as these people held of God and the immortality
of man's spirit, it is not surprising that a comparison between the

###### <span id="page_535">p. 535</span>

Vedic hymns and the narrow, unspiritual Mosaic books should result to
the advantage of the former in the mind of every unprejudiced scholar.
Even the ethical code of *Manu* is incomparably higher than that of the
*Pentateuch* of Moses, in the literal meaning of which all the
uninitiated scholars of two worlds cannot find a single proof that the
ancient Jews believed either in a future life or an immortal spirit in
man, or that Moses himself ever taught it. Yet, we have eminent
Orientalists who begin to suspect that the "dead letter" conceals
something not apparent at first sight. So Professor Whitney tells us
that "as we look yet further into the forms of the modern Hindu
ceremonial we discover not a little of the same discordance between
creed and observance; the one is not explained by the other," says this
great American scholar. He adds: "We are forced to the conclusion either
that India derived its system of rites from some foreign source, and
practiced them blindly, careless of their true import, or *else that
those rites are the production of another doctrine of older date,* and
have maintained themselves in popular usage after the decay of the creed
of which they were the original expression." <span
id="fr_1046"></span>[\*](#fn_1045)

This creed has not decayed, and its hidden philosophy, as understood now
by the initiated Hindus, is just as it was 10,000 years ago. But can our
scholars seriously hope to have it delivered unto them upon their first
demand? Or do they still expect to fathom the mysteries of the
World-Religion in its popular exoteric rites?

No orthodox Brahmans and Buddhists would deny the Christian incarnation;
only, they understand it in their own philosophical way, and how could
they deny it? The very corner-stone of their religious system is
periodical incarnations of the Deity. Whenever humanity is about merging
into materialism and moral degradation, a Supreme Spirit incarnates
himself in his creature selected for the purpose. The "Messenger of the
Highest" links itself with the duality of matter and soul, and the triad
being thus completed by the union of its Crown, a saviour is born, who
helps restore humanity to the path of truth and virtue. The early
Christian Church, all imbued with Asiatic philosophy, evidently shared
the same belief--otherwise *it would have neither erected into an
article of faith the second advent, nor cunningly invented the fable of
Anti-Christ as a precaution against possible future incarnations.*
Neither could they have imagined that Melchisedek was an avatar of
Christ. They had only to turn to the *Bagavedgitta* to find Christna or
Bhagaved saying to Arjuna: "He who follows me is saved by wisdom and
even by works. . . . *As often as virtue declines in the world, I make
myself manifest to save it*."

###### <span id="page_536">p. 536</span>

Indeed, it is more than difficult to avoid sharing this doctrine of
periodical incarnations. Has not the world witnessed, at rare intervals,
the advent of such grand characters as Christna, Sakya-muni, and Jesus?
Like the two latter personages, Christna seems to have been a real
being, deified by his school at some time in the twilight of history,
and made to fit into the frame of the time-honored religious programme.
Compare the two Redeemers, the Hindu and the Christian, the one
preceding the other by some thousands of years; place between them
Siddhartha Buddha, reflecting Christna and projecting into the night of
the future his own luminous shadow, out of whose collected rays were
shaped the outlines of the mythical Jesus, and from whose teachings were
drawn those of the historical Christos; and we find that under one
identical garment of poetical legend lived and breathed three real human
figures. The individual merit of each of them is rather brought out in
stronger relief than otherwise by this same mythical coloring; for no
unworthy character could have been selected for deification by the
popular instinct, so unerring and just when left untrammeled. *Vox
populi, vox Dei* was once true, however erroneous when applied to the
present priest-ridden mob.

Kapila, Orpheus, Pythagoras, Plato, Basilides, Marcian, Ammonius and
Plotinus, founded schools and sowed the germs of many a noble thought,
and disappearing left behind them the refulgence of demi-gods. But the
three personalities of Christna, Gautama, and Jesus appeared like true
gods, each in his epoch, and bequeathed to humanity three religions
built on the imperishable rock of ages. That all three, especially the
Christian faith, have in time become adulterated, and the latter almost
unrecognizable, is no fault of either of the noble Reformers. It is the
priestly self-styled husbandmen of the "vine of the Lord" who must be
held to account by future generations. Purify the three systems of the
dross of human dogmas, the pure essence remaining will be found
identical. Even Paul, the great, the honest apostle, in the glow of his
enthusiasm either unwittingly perverted the doctrines of Jesus, or else
his writings are disfigured beyond recognition. The *Talmud,* the record
of a people who, notwithstanding his apostasy from Judaism, yet feel
compelled to acknowledge Paul's greatness as a philosopher and
religionist, says of Aher (Paul), <span
id="fr_1047"></span>[\*](#fn_1046)

###### <span id="page_537">p. 537</span>

in the *Yerushalmi,* that "he corrupted the work of that man"--meaning
Jesus. <span id="fr_1048"></span>[\*](#fn_1047)

Meanwhile, before this smelting is completed by honest science and
future generations, let us glance at the present aspect of the legendary
three religions.

RESULT.

About the middle of the present century, the followers of these three
religions were reckoned as follows: <span
id="fr_1050"></span>[\*\*](#fn_1049)

OF **C**HRISTNA.  
Brahmans, 60,000,000.

OF **B**UDDHA.  
Buddhists, 450,000,000.

OF **J**ESUS.  
Christians, 260,000,000.

Such is the present aspect of these three great religions, of which each
is in turn reflected in its successor. Had the Christian dogmatizers
stopped there, the results would not have been so disastrous, for it
would be hard, indeed, to make a bad creed out of the lofty teachings of
Gautama, or Christna, as *Bhagaved.* But they went farther, and added to
pure primitive Christianity the fables of Hercules, Orpheus, and
Bacchus. As Mussulmans will not admit that their *Koran* is built on the
substratum of the Jewish *Bible,* so the Christians will not confess
that they owe next to everything to the Hindu religions. But the Hindus
have chronology to prove it to them. We see the best and most learned of
our writers uselessly striving to show that the extraordinary
similarities--amounting to identity--between Christna and Christ are due
to the spurious *Gospels of the Infancy* and of *St. Thomas* having
"probably circulated on the coast of Malabar, and giving color to the
story of Christna." <span id="fr_1051"></span>[\*\*\*](#fn_1050) Why not
accept truth in all sincerity, and reversing matters, admit that St.
Thomas, faithful to that policy of proselytism which marked the earliest
Christians, when he found in Malabar the original of the mythical Christ
in Christna, tried to blend the two; and, adopting in his gospel (from
which all others were copied) the most important details of the story of
the Hindu Avatar, engrafted the Christian heresy on the primitive
religion of Christna. For any one acquainted with the spirit of
Brahmanism, the idea of Brahmans accepting anything from a stranger,
especially from a foreigner, is simply ridiculous. That they, the most
fanatic people in religious matters, who, during centuries, cannot be
compelled to adopt the most simple of European usages, should be
suspected of having introduced into their sacred books unverified

###### <span id="page_540">p. 540</span>

legends about a foreign God, is something so preposterously illogical,
that it is really waste of time to contradict the idea!

We will not stop to examine the too well-known resemblances between the
external form of Buddhistic worship--especially Lamaism--and Roman
Catholicism, for noticing which poor Huc paid dear--but proceed to
compare the most vital points. Of all the original manuscripts that have
been translated from the various languages in which Buddhism is
expounded, the most extraordinary and interesting are *Buddha's
Dhammapada,* or *Path of Virtue,* translated from the Pali by Colonel
Rogers, <span id="fr_1052"></span>[\*](#fn_1051) and the *Wheel of the
Law,* containing the views of a Siamese Minister of State on his own and
other religions, and translated by Henry Alabaster. <span
id="fr_1053"></span>[\*\*](#fn_1052) The reading of these two books, and
the discovery in them of similarities of thought and doctrine often
amounting to identity, prompted Dr. Inman to write the many profoundly
true passages embodied in one of his last works, *Ancient Faith and
Modern*. <span id="fr_1054"></span>[\*\*\*](#fn_1053) "I speak with
sober earnestness," writes this kind-hearted, sincere scholar, "when I
say that after forty years' experience among those who profess
Christianity, and those who proclaim . . . more or less quietly their
disagreement with it, I have noticed more sterling virtue and morality
amongst the last than the first. . . . I know personally many pious,
good Christian people, whom I honor, admire, and, perhaps, would be glad
to emulate or to equal; but they deserve the eulogy thus passed on them,
in consequence of their good sense, having ignored the doctrine of faith
to a great degree, and having cultivated the practice of good works. . .
. In my judgment the most praiseworthy Christians whom I know are
*modified Buddhists,* though probably, not one of them ever heard of
Siddartha." <span id="fr_1055"></span>[\*\*\*\*](#fn_1054)

Between the Lamaico-Buddhistic and Roman Catholic articles of faith and
ceremonies, there are fifty-one points presenting a perfect and striking
similarity; and four diametrically antagonistic.

As it would be useless to enumerate the "similarities," for the reader
may find them carefully noted in Inman's work on *Ancient Faith and
Modern,* pp. 237-240, we will quote but the four dissimilarities, and
leave every one to draw his own deductions therefrom:

|                                                                                                               |                                                                                                                                                     |

Which of these theologies most commends itself to the sincere inquirer,
is a question that may safely be left to the sound judgment of the
reader. One offers light, the other darkness.

The *Wheel of the Law* has the following:

"Buddhists believe that every act, word, or thought has its consequence,
which will appear sooner or later in the present or in the future state.
Evil acts will produce evil consequences, <span
id="fr_1057"></span>[\*](#fn_1056) good acts will produce good
consequences: prosperity in this world, or birth in heaven . . . in some
future state." <span id="fr_1058"></span>[\*\*](#fn_1057)

This is strict and impartial justice. This is the idea of a Supreme
Power which cannot fail, and therefore, can have neither wrath nor
mercy, but leaves every cause, great or small, to work out its
inevitable effects. "With what measure you mete, it shall be measured to
you again" <span id="fr_1059"></span>[\*\*\*](#fn_1058) neither by
expression nor implication points to any hope of future mercy or
salvation by proxy. Cruelty and mercy are finite feelings. The Supreme
Deity is infinite, hence it can only be **J**UST, and Justice must be
blind. The ancient Pagans held on this question far more philosophical
views than modern Christians, for they represented their Themis
blindfold. And the Siamese author of the work under notice, has again a
more reverent conception of the Deity than the Christians have, when he
thus gives vent to his thought: "A Buddhist might believe in the
existence of a God, sublime above all human qualities and attributes--a
perfect God, above love, and hatred, and jealousy, calmly resting in a
quiet happiness that nothing could disturb; and of such a God he would
speak no disparagement, not from a desire to please Him, or fear to
offend Him, but from natural veneration. But he cannot understand a God
with the attributes and qualities of men, a God who loves and hates, and
shows anger; a Deity, who, whether described to

###### <span id="page_542">p. 542</span>

him by Christian missionaries, or by Mahometans, or Brahmans, or Jews,
falls below his standard of even an ordinary good man." <span
id="fr_1060"></span>[\*](#fn_1059)

We have often wondered at the extraordinary ideas of God and His justice
that seem to be honestly held by those Christians who blindly rely upon
the clergy for their religion, and never upon their own reason. How
strangely illogical is this doctrine of the Atonement. We propose to
discuss it with the Christians from the Buddhistic stand-point, and show
at once by what a series of sophistries, directed toward the one object
of tightening the ecclesiastical yoke upon the popular neck, its
acceptance as a divine command has been finally effected; also, that it
has proved one of the most pernicious and demoralizing of doctrines.

The clergy say: no matter how enormous our crimes against the laws of
God and of man, we have but to believe in the self-sacrifice of Jesus
for the salvation of mankind, and His blood will wash out every stain.
God's mercy is boundless and unfathomable. It is impossible to conceive
of a human sin so damnable that the price paid in advance for the
redemption of the sinner would not wipe it out if a thousandfold worse.
And, furthermore, it is never too late to repent. Though the offender
wait until the last minute of the last hour of the last day of his
mortal life, before his blanched lips utter the confession of faith, he
may go to Paradise; the dying thief did it, and so may all others as
vile. These are the assumptions of the Church.

But if we step outside the little circle of creed and consider the
universe as a whole balanced by the exquisite adjustment of parts, how
all sound logic, how the faintest glimmering sense of Justice revolts
against this Vicarious Atonement! If the criminal sinned only against
himself, and wronged no one but himself; if by sincere repentance he
could cause the obliteration of past events, not only from the memory of
man, but also from that imperishable record, which no deity--not even
the Supremest of the Supreme--can cause to disappear, then this dogma
might not be incomprehensible. But to maintain that one may wrong his
fellow-man, kill, disturb the equilibrium of society, and the natural
order of things, and then--through cowardice, hope, or compulsion,
matters not--be forgiven by believing that the spilling of one blood
washes out the other blood spirt--this is preposterous! Can the
*results* of a crime be obliterated even though the crime itself should
be pardoned? The effects of a cause are never limited to the boundaries
of the cause, nor can the results of crime be confined to the offender
and his victim. Every good as well as evil action has its effects, as
palpably as the stone flung into a calm water. The simile is trite, but
it is the best ever conceived, so let us use

###### <span id="page_543">p. 543</span>

it. The eddying circles are greater and swifter, as the disturbing
object is greater or smaller, but the smallest pebble, nay, the tiniest
speck, makes its ripples. And this disturbance is not alone visible and
on the surface. Below, unseen, in every direction--outward and
downward--drop pushes drop until the sides and bottom are touched by the
force. More, the air, above the water is agitated, and this disturbance
passes, as the physicists tell us, from stratum to stratum out into
space forever and ever; an impulse has been given to matter, and that is
never lost, can never be recalled! . . .

So with crime, and so with its opposite. The action may be
instantaneous, the effects are eternal. When, after the stone is once
flung into the pond, we can recall it to the hand, roll back the
ripples, obliterate the force expended, restore the etheric waves to
their previous state of non-being, and wipe out every trace of the act
of throwing the missile, so that Time's record shall not show that it
ever happened, then, *then* we may patiently hear Christians argue for
the efficacy of this Atonement.

The Chicago *Times* recently printed the hangman's record of the first
half of the present year (1877)--a long and ghastly record of murders
and hangings. Nearly every one of these murderers received religious
consolation, and many announced that they had received God's forgiveness
through the blood of Jesus, and were going that day to Heaven! *Their
conversion was effected in prison.* See how this ledger-balance of
Christian justice (!) stands: These red-handed murderers, urged on by
the demons of lust, revenge, cupidity, fanaticism, or mere brutal thirst
for blood, slew their victims, in most cases, without giving them time
to repent, or call on Jesus to wash them clean with his blood. They,
perhaps, died sinful, and, of course,--consistently with theological
logic--met the reward of their greater or lesser offenses. But the
murderer, overtaken by human justice, is imprisoned, wept over by
sentimentalists, prayed with and at, pronounces the charmed words of
conversion, and goes to the scaffold a redeemed child of Jesus! Except
for the murder, he would not have been prayed with, redeemed, pardoned.
Clearly this man did well to murder, for thus he gained eternal
happiness? And how about the victim, and his or her family, relatives,
dependants, social relations--has justice no recompense for them? Must
they suffer in this world and the next, while he who wronged them sits
beside the "holy thief" of Calvary and is forever blessed? On this
question the clergy keep a prudent silence.

Steve Anderson was one of these American criminals--convicted of double
murder, arson, and robbery. Before the hour of his death he was
"converted," but, the record tells us that "*his clerical attendants
objected to his reprieve, on the ground that they felt sure of his
salvation* 

###### <span id="page_544">p. 544</span>

*should he die then, but could not answer for it if his execution was
postponed.*" We address these ministers, and ask them to tell us on what
grounds they felt sure of such a monstrous thing. How they could feel
*sure,* with the dark future before them, and the endless results of
this double murder, arson, and robbery? They could be sure of nothing,
but that their abominable doctrine is the cause of three-fourths of the
crimes of so-called Christians; that these terrific causes must produce
like monstrous effects, which in their turn will beget other results,
and so roll on throughout eternity to an accomplishment that no man can
calculate.

Or take another crime, one of the most selfish, cruel, and heartless,
and yet the most frequent, the seduction of a young girl. Society, by an
instinct of self-preservation, pitilessly judges the victim, and
ostracizes her. She may be driven to infanticide, or self-murder, or if
too averse to die, live to plunge into a career of vice and crime. She
may become the mother of criminals, who, as in the now celebrated Jukes,
of whose appalling details Mr. Dugdale has published the particulars,
breed other generations of felons to the number of hundreds, in fifty or
sixty years. All this social disaster came through one man's selfish
passion; shall he be forgiven by Divine Justice until his offense is
expiated, and punishment fall only upon the wretched human scorpions
begotten of his lust?

An outcry has just been made in England over the discovery that Anglican
priests are largely introducing auricular confession and granting
absolution after enforcing penances. Inquiry shows the same thing
prevailing more or less in the United States. Put to the ordeal of
cross-examination, the clergy quote triumphantly from the English *Book
of Common Prayer* the rubrics which clearly give them the absolving
authority, through the power of "God, the Holy Ghost," committed unto
them by the bishop by imposition of hands at their ordination. The
bishop, questioned, points to *Matthew* xvi., 19, for the source of his
authority to bind and loose on earth those who are to be blessed or
damned in heaven; and to the apostolic succession for proof of its
transmission from Simon Barjona to himself. The present volumes have
been written to small purpose if they have not shown, 1, that Jesus, the
Christ-God, is a myth concocted two centuries after the real Hebrew
Jesus died; 2, that, therefore, he never had any authority to give
Peter, or any one else, plenary power; 3, that even if he had given such
authority, the word Petra (rock) referred to the revealed truths of the
Petroma, not to him who thrice denied him; and that besides, the
apostolic successon is a gross and palpable fraud; 4, that the *Gospel
according to Matthew* is a fabrication based upon a wholly different
manuscript. The whole thing, therefore, is an imposition alike upon
priest and penitent. But putting all these points aside for the moment,
it suffices to ask these pretended

###### <span id="page_545">p. 545</span>

agents of the three gods of the Trinity, how they reconcile it with the
most rudimental notions of equity, that if the power to pardon sinners
for sinning has been given them, *they did not also receive the ability
by miracle to obliterate the wrongs done against person or property.*
Let them restore life to the murdered; honor to the dishonored; property
to those who have been wronged, and force the scales of human and divine
justice to recover their equilibrium. Then we may talk of their divine
commission to bind and loose. Let them say, if they can do this.
Hitherto the world has received nothing but sophistry--believed on
*blind* faith; we ask palpable, tangible evidence of their God's justice
and mercy. But all are silent; no answer, no reply, and still the
inexorable unerring Law of Compensation proceeds on its unswerving path.
If we but watch its progress, we will find that it ignores all creeds,
shows no preferences, but its sunlight and its thunderbolts fall alike
on heathen and Christian. No absolution can shield the latter when
guilty, no anathema hurt the former when innocent.

Away from us such an insulting conception of divine justice as that
preached by priests on their own authority. It is fit only for cowards
and criminals! If they are backed by a whole array of Fathers and
Churchmen, we are supported by the greatest of all authorities, an
instinctive and reverential sense of the everlasting and everpresent law
of harmony and justice.

But, besides that of reason, we have other evidence to show that such a
construction is wholly unwarranted. The *Gospels* being "Divine
revelation," doubtless Christians will regard their testimony as
conclusive. Do they affirm that Jesus gave himself as a voluntary
sacrifice? On the contrary, there is not a word to sustain the idea.
They make it clear that he would rather have lived to continue what he
considered his mission, and that *he died because he could not help it,
and only when betrayed.* Before, when threatened with violence, *he had
made himself invisible* by employing the mesmeric power over the
bystanders, claimed by every Eastern adept, and escaped. When, finally,
he saw that his time had come, he succumbed to the inevitable. But see
him in the garden, on the Mount of Olives, writhing in agony until "his
sweat was, as it were, great drops of blood," praying with fervid
supplication that the cup might be removed from him; exhausted by his
struggle to such a degree that an angel from heaven had to come and
strengthen him; and say if the picture is that of a self-immolating
hostage and martyr. To crown all, and leave no lingering doubt in our
minds, we have his own despairing words, "**N**OT MY WILL, *but thine*,
be done!" (*Luke* xxii. 42. 43.)

Again, in the *Puranas* it may be found that Christna was nailed to a
tree by the arrow of a hunter, who, begging the dying god to forgive

###### <span id="page_546">p. 546</span>

him, receives the following answer: "Go, hunter, through my favor, to
Heaven, the abode of the gods. . . . Then the illustrious Christna,
having united himself with his own pure, spiritual, inexhaustible,
inconceivable, unborn, undecaying, imperishable, and universal Spirit,
which is one with Vasudeva, abandoned his mortal body, and . . . he
became Nirguna" (Wilson's *Vishnu Purana,* p. 612). Is not this the
original of the story of Christ forgiving the thief on the cross, and
promising him a place in Heaven? Such examples "challenge inquiry as to
their origin and meaning *so long anterior to Christianity,*" says Dr.
Lundy in *Monumental Christianity,* and yet to all this he adds: "The
idea of Krishna as a shepherd, I take to be older than either (the
*Gospel of Infancy* and that of *St. John*)*, and prophetic of Christ*"
(p. 156).

Facts like these, perchance, furnished later a plausible pretext for
declaring apocryphal all such works as the *Homilies,* which proved but
too clearly the utter want of any early authority for the doctrine of
atonement. The *Homilies* clash but little with the Gospels*;* they
disagree entirely with the dogmas of the Church. Peter knew nothing of
the atonement; and his reverence for the mythical father Adam would
never have allowed him to admit that this patriarch had sinned and was
accursed. Neither do the Alexandrian theological schools appear to have
been cognizant of this doctrine, nor Tertullian; nor was it discussed by
any of the earlier Fathers. Philo represents the story of the *Fall* as
symbolical, and Origen regarded it the same way as Paul, as an
allegory. <span id="fr_1061"></span>[\*](#fn_1060)

Whether they will or not, the Christians have to credit the foolish
story of Eve's temptation by a serpent. Besides, Augustine has formally
pronounced upon the subject. "God, by His arbitrary will," he says, "has
selected beforehand certain persons, *without regard to foreseen faith
or good actions, and has irretrievably ordained to bestow upon them
eternal happiness; while He has condemned others in the same way to
eternal reprobation*"!! (*De dono perseverantae*). <span
id="fr_1062"></span>[\*\*](#fn_1061)

<span id="page_547">p. 547</span>

Calvin promulgated views of Divine partiality and bloodthirstiness
equally abhorrent. "The human race, corrupted radically in the fall with
Adam, has upon it the guilt and impotence of original sin; its
redemption can be achieved only through an incarnation and a
propitiation; of this redemption only electing grace can make the soul a
participant, and such grace, once given, is never lost; *this election
can come only from God, and it includes only a part of the race, the
rest being left to perdition;* election and perdition (the *horribile
decretum*) are both predestinated in the Divine plan; that plan is a
decree, and this decree is eternal and unchangeable . . . justification
is by *faith alone,* and *faith is the gift of God.*"

O Divine Justice, how blasphemed has been thy name! Unfortunately for
all such speculations, belief in the propitiatory efficacy of blood can
be traced to the oldest rites. Hardly a nation remained ignorant of it.
Every people offered animal and even human sacrifices to the gods, in
the hope of averting thereby public calamity, by pacifying the wrath of
some avenging deity. There are instances of Greek and Roman generals
offering their lives simply for the success of their army. Caesar
complains of it, and calls it a superstition of the Gauls. "They devote
themselves to death . . . believing that unless life is rendered for
life the immortal gods cannot be appeased," he writes. "If any evil is
about to befall either those who now sacrifice, or Egypt, may it be
averted on this head," was pronounced by the Egyptian priests when
sacrificing one of their sacred animals. And imprecations were uttered
over the head of the expiatory victim, around whose horns a piece of
byblus was rolled. <span id="fr_1064"></span>[\*](#fn_1063) The animal
was generally led to some barren region, sacred to Typhon, in those
primitive ages when this fatal deity was yet held in a certain
consideration by the Egyptians. It is in this custom that lies the
origin of the "scape-goat" of the Jews, who, when the rufous ass-god was
rejected by the Egyptians, began sacrificing to another deity the "red
heifer."

"Let all sins that have been committed in this world fall on me that the
world may be delivered," exclaimed Gautama, the Hindu Saviour, centuries
before our era.

###### <span id="page_548">p. 548</span>

No one will pretend to assert in our own age that it was the Egyptians
who borrowed anything from the Israelites, as they now accuse the Hindus
of doing. Bunsen, Lepsius, Champollion, have long since established the
precedence of Egypt over the Israelites in age as well as in all the
religious rites that we now recognize among the "chosen people." Even
the *New Testament* teems with quotations and repetitions from the *Book
of the Dead,* and Jesus, if everything attributed to him by his four
biographers is true--must have been acquainted with the Egyptian
Funereal Hymns. <span id="fr_1065"></span>[\*](#fn_1064) In the Gospel
according to *Matthew* we find whole sentences from the ancient and
sacred *Ritual* which preceded our era by more than 4,000 years. We will
again compare. <span id="fr_1066"></span>[\*\*](#fn_1065)

The "soul" under trial is brought before Osiris, the "Lord of Truth,"
who sits decorated with the Egyptian cross, emblem of eternal life, and
holding in his right hand the *Vannus* or the flagellum of
justice. <span id="fr_1067"></span>[\*\*\*](#fn_1066) The spirit begins,
in the "Hall of the Two Truths," an earnest appeal, and enumerates its
good deeds, supported by the responses of the forty-two assessors--*its
incarnated deeds and accusers.* If justified, it is addressed as
*Osiris,* thus assuming the appellation of the Deity whence its divine
essence proceeded, and the following words, full of majesty and justice,
are pronounced! "Let the *Osiris* go; ye see he is without fault. . . .
He lived on truth, he has fed on truth. . . . *The god has welcomed him*
as he desired. *He has given food to my hungry, drink to my thirsty
ones, clothes to my naked*. . . . He has made the sacred food of the
gods the meat of the spirits."

In the parable of *the Kingdom of Heaven* (*Matthew* xxv.), the *Son of
Man* (Osiris is also called the Son) sits upon the throne of his glory,
judging the nations, and says to the justified, "Come ye blessed of my
Father (*the* God) inherit the kingdom. . . . For *I* *was an hungered,
and ye gave me meat; I was thirsty and ye gave me drink* . . . *naked
and* 

###### <span id="page_549">p. 549</span>

*ye clothed me*." <span id="fr_1068"></span>[\*](#fn_1067) To complete
the resemblance (*Matthew* iii. 12): John is made to describe Christ as
Osiris, "whose *fan* (winnow or *vannus*) is in his hand, and who will
"purge his floor and gather his wheat into the garner."

The same in relation to Buddhist legends. In *Matthew* iv. 19, Jesus is
made to say: "Follow me and I will make you *fishers* of men," the whole
adapted to a conversation between him and Simon Peter and Andrew his
brother.

In Schmidt's "*Der Weise und der Thor*," <span
id="fr_1069"></span>[\*\*](#fn_1068) a work full of anecdotes about
Buddha and his disciples, the whole from original texts, it is said of a
new convert to the faith, that "he had been caught by the hook of the
doctrine, just as a fish, who has caught at the bait and line is
securely pulled out." In the temples of Siam the image of the expected
Buddha, the Messiah Maitree, is represented with a fisherman's net in
the hand, while in Thibet he holds a kind of a trap. The explanation of
it reads as follows: "He (Buddha) disseminates upon the Ocean of birth
and decay the Lotus-flower of the excellent law as *a bait;* with the
loop of devotion, never cast out in vain, he brings living beings up
like fishes, and carries them to the other side of the river, where
there is true understanding." <span
id="fr_1070"></span>[\*\*\*](#fn_1069)

Had the erudite Archbishop Cave, Grabe, and Dr. Parker, who so zealously
contended in their time for the admission of the *Epistles of Jesus
Christ and Abgarus, King of Edessa,* into the Canon of the *Scripture,*
lived in our days of Max Muller and Sanscrit scholarship, we doubt
whether they would have acted as they did. The first mention of these
Epistles ever made, was by the famous Eusebius. This pious bishop seems
to have been self-appointed to furnish Christianity with the most
unexpected proofs to corroborate its wildest fancies. Whether

###### <span id="page_550">p. 550</span>

among the many accomplishments of the Bishop of Caesarea, we must
include a knowledge of the Cingalese, Pehlevi, Thibetan, and other
languages, we know not; but he surely transcribed the letters of Jesus
and Abgarus, and the story of the miraculous portrait of Christ taken on
a piece of cloth, by the simple wiping of his face, from the
Buddhistical Canon. To be sure, the bishop declared that he found the
letter himself written in Syriac, preserved among the registers and
records of the city of Edessa, where Abgarus reigned. <span
id="fr_1071"></span>[\*](#fn_1070) We recall the words of Babrias:
"Myth, O son of King Alexander, is an ancient human invention of
Syrians, who lived in old time under Ninus and Belus." Edessa was one of
the ancient "holy cities." The Arabs venerate it to this day; and the
purest Arabic is there spoken. They call it still by its ancient name
Orfa, once the city *Arpha-Kasda* (Arphaxad) the seat of a College of
Chaldeans and Magi; whose missionary, called Orpheus, brought thence the
Bacchic Mysteries to Thrace. Very naturally, Eusebius found there the
tales which he wrought over into the story of Abgarus, and the sacred
picture taken on a cloth; as that of Bhagavat, or the blessed Tathagata
(Buddha) <span id="fr_1072"></span>[\*\*](#fn_1071) was obtained by King
Binsbisara. <span id="fr_1073"></span>[\*\*\*](#fn_1072) The King having
brought it, Bhagavat projected his shadow on it. <span
id="fr_1074"></span>[\*\*\*\*](#fn_1073) This bit of "miraculous stuff,"
with its shadow, is still preserved, say the Buddhists; "only the shadow
itself is rarely seen."

In like manner, the Gnostic author of *the Gospel according to John,*
copied and metamorphosed the legend of Ananda who asked drink of a
Matangha woman--the antitype of the woman met by Jesus at the
well, <span id="fr_1075"></span>[\*\*\*\*\*](#fn_1074)

<span id="page_551">p. 551</span>

and was reminded by her that she belongs to a low caste, and may have
nothing to do with a holy monk. "I do not ask thee, my sister," answers
Ananda to the woman, "either thy caste or thy family, I only ask thee
for water, if thou canst give me some." This Matangha woman, charmed and
moved to tears, repents, joins the monastic Order of Gautama, and
becomes a saint, rescued from a life of unchastity by Sakya-muni. Many
of her subsequent actions were used by Christian forgers, to endow Mary
Magdalen and other female saints and martyrs.

"And whosoever shall give to drink unto one of these little ones a cup
of cold water only in the name of a disciple, verily I say unto you, he
shall in no wise lose his reward," says the Gospel (*Matthew* x. 42).
"Whosoever, with a purely believing heart, offers nothing but a handful
of water, or presents so much to the spiritual assembly, or gives drink
therewith to the poor and needy, or to a beast of the field; this
meritorious action will not be exhausted in many ages," <span
id="fr_1076"></span>[\*](#fn_1075) says the Buddhist

Canon.

At the hour of Gautama-Buddha's birth there were 32,000 wonders
performed. The clouds stopped immovable in the sky, the waters of the
rivers ceased to flow; the flowers ceased unbudding; the birds remained

###### <span id="page_552">p. 552</span>

silent and full of wonder; all nature remained suspended in her course,
and was full of expectation. "There was a preternatural light spread all
over the world; animals suspended their eating; the blind saw; and the
lame and dumb were cured," etc. <span id="fr_1077"></span>[\*](#fn_1076)

We now quote from the

Protevangelion:

"At the hour of the Nativity, as Joseph looked up into the air, 'I saw,'
he says, '*the clouds astonished,* and the fowls of the air stopping in
the midst of their flight. . . . And I beheld the sheep dispersed . . .
and *yet the sheep stood still;* and I looked into a river, and saw the
kids

with their mouths close to the water, and touching it, but they did not
drink.

"*Then a bright cloud overshadowed the cave.* But on a sudden the cloud
became *a great light* in the cave, so that their eyes could not bear
it. . . . The hand of Salome, which was withered, was straightway cured.
. . . The blind saw; the lame and dumb were cured." <span
id="fr_1078"></span>[\*\*](#fn_1077)

When sent to school, the young Gautama, without having ever studied,
completely worsted all his competitors; not only in writing, but in
arithmetic, mathematics, metaphysics, wrestling, archery, astronomy,
geometry, and finally vanquishes his own professors by giving the
definition of sixty-four kinds of writings, which were unknown to the
masters themselves. <span id="fr_1079"></span>[\*\*\*](#fn_1078)

And this is what is said again in the *Gospel of the Infancy:* "And when
he (Jesus) was twelve years old . . . a certain principal Rabbi asked
him, 'Hast thou read books?' and a certain astronomer asked the Lord
Jesus whether he had studied astronomy. And Lord Jesus explained to him
. . . about the spheres . . . about the physics and metaphysics. Also
things that reason of man had never discovered. . . . The constitutions
of the body, how the soul operated upon the body, . . . etc. And at this
the master was so surprised that he said: 'I believe this boy was born
before Noah . . . he is more learned than any master.' " <span
id="fr_1080"></span>[\*\*\*\*](#fn_1079)

The precepts of Hillel, who died forty years B. C., appear rather as
quotations than original expressions in the Sermon on the Mount. Jesus
taught the world nothing that had not been taught as earnestly before by
other masters. He begins his sermon with certain purely Buddhistic

###### <span id="page_553">p. 553</span>

precepts that had found acceptance among the Essenes, and were generally
practiced by the *Orphikoi,* and the Neo-platonists. There were the
Philhellenes, who, like Apollonius, had devoted their lives to moral and
physical purity, and who practiced asceticism. He tries to imbue the
hearts of his audience with a scorn for worldly wealth; a fakir-like
unconcern for the morrow; love for humanity, poverty, and chastity. He
blesses the poor in spirit, the meek, the hungering and the thirsting
after righteousness, the merciful and the peace-makers, and,
Buddha-like, leaves but a poor chance for the proud castes to enter into
the kingdom of heaven. Every word of his sermon is an echo of the
essential principles of monastic Buddhism. The ten commandments of
Buddha, as found in an appendix to the *Pratimoksha Sutra* (Pali-Burman
text), are elaborated to their full extent in *Matthew.* If we desire to
acquaint ourselves with the historical Jesus we have to set the mythical
Christ entirely aside, and learn all we can of the man in the first
Gospel. His doctrines, religious views, and grandest aspirations will be
found concentrated in his sermon.

This is the principal cause of the failure of missionaries to convert
Brahmanists and Buddhists. These see that the little of really good that
is offered in the new religion is paraded only in theory, while their
own faith demands that those identical rules shall be applied in
practice. Notwithstanding the impossibility for Christian missionaries
to understand clearly the spirit of a religion wholly based on that
doctrine of emanation which is so inimical to their own theology, the
reasoning powers of some simple Buddhistical preachers are so high, that
we see a scholar like Gutzlaff, <span id="fr_1081"></span>[\*](#fn_1080)
utterly silenced and put to great straits by Buddhists. Judson, the
famous Baptist missionary in Burmah, confesses, in his *Journal,* the
difficulties to which he was often driven by them. Speaking of a certain
Ooyan, he remarks that his strong mind was capable of grasping the most
difficult subjects. "His words," he remarks, "are as smooth as oil, as
sweet as honey, and as sharp as razors; his mode of reasoning is soft,
insinuating, and acute; and so adroitly does he act his part, that *I
with the strength of truth,* was scarcely able to keep him down." It
appears though, that at a later period of his mission, Mr. Judson found
that he had utterly mistaken the doctrine. "I begin to find," he says,
"that the semi-atheism, which I had sometimes mentioned, is nothing but
a refined Buddhism, having its foundation in the Buddhistic Scriptures."
Thus he discovered at last that while there is in Buddhism "a generic
term of most exalted perfection actually applied to numerous
individuals, a Buddha superior to the whole host of subordinate
deities," there are also lurking in the

###### <span id="page_554">p. 554</span>

system "the glimmerings of an *anima mundi* anterior to, and even
superior to, Buddha." <span id="fr_1082"></span>[\*](#fn_1081)

This is a happy discovery, indeed!

Even the so-slandered Chinese believe in *One*, Highest God. "The
Supreme Ruler of Heavens." Yuh-Hwang-Shang-ti, has his name inscribed
only on the golden tablet before the altar of heaven at the great temple
at Pekin, T'Iantan. "This worship," says Colonel Yule, "is mentioned by
the Mahometan narrator of Shah Rukh's embassy (A.D. 1421): 'Every year
there are some days on which the emperor eats no animal food. . . . He
spends his time in an apartment which contains *no* *idol,* and says
that *he is worshipping the God of Heaven.*' " <span
id="fr_1083"></span>[\*\*](#fn_1082)

Speaking of Shahrastani, the great Arabian scholar, Chwolsohn says that
for him Sabaeism was not astrolatry, as many are inclined to think. He
thought "that God is too sublime and too great to occupy Himself with
the immediate management of this world; that He has, therefore,
transferred the government thereof to the gods, and retained only the
most important affairs for Himself; that further, man is too weak to be
able to apply immediately to the Highest; that he must, therefore,
address his prayers and sacrifices to the intermediate divinities, to
whom the management of the world has been entrusted by the Highest."
Chwolsohn argues that this idea is as old as the world, and that "in the
heathen world this view was universally shared by the cultivated." <span
id="fr_1084"></span>[\*\*\*](#fn_1083)

Father Boori, a Portuguese missionary, who was sent to convert the "poor
heathen" of Cochin-China, as early as the sixteenth century, "protests
in despair, in his narrative, that there is not a dress, office, or
ceremony in the Church of Rome, to which the Devil has not here provided
some counterpart. Even when the Father began inveighing against the
idols, he was answered that these were the images of departed great men,
whom they worshipped exactly on the same principle, and in the same
manner, as the Catholics did the images of the apostles and
martyrs." <span id="fr_1085"></span>[\*\*\*\*](#fn_1084) Moreover, these
idols have importance but in the eyes of the ignorant multitudes. The
*philosophy* of Buddhism ignores images and fetishes. Its strongest
vitality lies in its psychological conceptions of man's *inner* self.
The road to the supreme state of felicity, called the Ford of Nirvana,
winds its invisible paths through the spiritual, not physical life of a
person while on this earth. The sacred Buddhistical literature points
the way by stimulating man to follow *practically* the example of
Gautama.

###### <span id="page_555">p. 555</span>

Therefore, the Buddhistical writings lay a particular stress on the
spiritual privileges of man, advising him to cultivate his powers for
the production of *Meipo* (phenomena) during life, and for the
attainment of Nirvana in the hereafter.

But turning again from the historical to the mythical narratives,
invented alike about Christna, Buddha, and Christ, we find the
following:

Setting a model for the Christian avatar and the archangel Gabriel to
follow, the luminous San-tusita (Bodhisat) appeared to Maha-maya 'like a
cloud in the moonlight, coming from the north, and in his hand holding a
white lotus.' He announced to her the birth of her son, and
circumambulating the queen's couch thrice . . . passed away from the
dewa-loka and was conceived *in the world of men. <span
id="fr_1086"></span>[\*](#fn_1085)* The resemblance will be found still
more perfect upon examining the illustrations in mediaeval
psalters, <span id="fr_1087"></span>[\*\*](#fn_1086) and the
panel-paintings of the sixteenth century (in the Church of Jouy, for
instance, in which the Virgin is represented kneeling, with her hands
uplifted toward the Holy Ghost, and the unborn child is miraculously
seen through her body), and then finding the same subject treated in the
identical way in the sculptures in certain convents in Thibet. In the
Pali-Buddhistic annals, and other religious records, it is stated that
Maha-devi and all her attendants were constantly "gatified with the
sight of the infant Bodhisatva quietly developing within his mother's
bosom, and beaming already, from his place of gestation, upon humanity
"the resplendent moonshine of his future benevolence." <span
id="fr_1088"></span>[\*\*\*](#fn_1087)

Ananda, the cousin and future disciple of Sakya-muni, is represented as
having been born at the same time. He appears to have been the original
for the old legends about John the Baptist. For example, the Pali
narrative relates that Maha-maya, while pregnant with the sage, paid a
visit to his mother, as Mary did to the mother of the Baptist.
Immediately, as she entered the apartment, the unborn Ananda greeted the
unborn Buddha-Siddhartha, who also returned the salutation; and in like
manner the babe, afterward John the Baptist, leaped in the womb of
Elizabeth when Mary came in. <span
id="fr_1089"></span>[\*\*\*\*](#fn_1088) More even that that; for Didron
describes a scene of salutation, painted on shutters at Lyons, between
Elizabeth and Mary, in which the two unborn infants, both pictured as
outside their mothers, are also saluting each other. <span
id="fr_1090"></span>[\*\*\*\*\*](#fn_1089)

If we turn now to Christna and attentively compare the prophecies
respecting him, as collected in the Ramatsariarian traditions of the

###### <span id="page_556">p. 556</span>

Atharva, the *Vedangas,* and the *Vedantas, <span
id="fr_1091"></span>[\*](#fn_1090)* with passages in the *Bible* and
apocryphal Gospels, of which it is pretended that some presage the
coming of Christ, we shall find very curious facts. Following are

Let there be exaggeration or not in attributing to the *Atharva-Veda*
and the other books such a great antiquity, the fact remains that *these
prophecies and their realization preceded Christianity,* and Christna
preceded Christ. That is all we need care to inquire.

One is completely overwhelmed with astonishment upon reading Dr. Lundy's
*Monumental Christianity.* It would be difficult to say whether an
admiration for the author's erudition, or amazement at his serene and
unparalleled sophistry is stronger. He has gathered a world of facts
which prove that the religions, far more ancient than Christianity, of
Christna, Buddha, and Osiris had anticipated even its minutest symbols.
His materials come from no forged papyri, no interpolated Gospels, but
from sculptures on the walls of ancient temples, from monuments,
inscriptions, and other archaic relics, only mutilated by the hammers of
iconoclasts, the cannon of fanatics, and the effects of time. He shows
us Christna and Apollo as good shepherds; Christna holding the cruciform
*chank* and the *chakra,* and Christna "crucified in space," as he calls
it (*Monumental Christianity,* fig. 72). Of this figure--borrowed by Dr.
Lundy from Moor's *Hindu Pantheon--*it may be truly said that it is
calculated to petrify a Christian with astonishment, for it is the
crucified Christ of Romish art to the last degree of resemblance. Not a
feature is lacking; and, the author says of it himself: "This
representation I believe to be anterior to Christianity. . . . It looks
like a Christian crucifix in many respects. . . . The drawing, the
attitude, the nail-marks in hands and feet, indicate a Christian origin,
while the Parthian coronet of seven points, the absence of the wood, and
of the usual inscription, and the rays of glory above, would seem to
point to some other than a Christian origin. Can it be the victim-man,
or the priest and victim both in one, of the Hindu Mythology, who
offered himself a sacrifice before the worlds were? Can it be Plato's
Second God who impressed himself on the universe in the form of the
cross? Or is it his divine man who would be scourged, tormented,
fettered; have his eyes burnt out; and lastly . . . *would be
crucified?*" (*Republic,* c. ii., p. 52, *Spens. Trans.*). It is all
that and much more; *Archaic Religious Philosophy* was universal.

As it is, Dr. Lundy contradicts Moor, and maintains that this figure is
that of *Wittoba,* one of the avatars of Vishnu, hence Christna, and
*anterior to Christianity,* which is a fact not very easily to be put
down. And yet although he finds it prophetic of Christianity, he thinks
it has no relation whatever to Christ! His only reason is that "in a
Christian crucifix the glory always comes from the sacred head; here it
is from above and beyond. . . . The Pundit's Wittoba then, given to
Moor, would seem to be the crucified *Krishna,* the shepherd-god of
Mathura

###### <span id="page_558">p. 558</span>

. . . a *Saviour--the Lord of the Covenant, as well as Lord of Heaven
and earth--pure and impure, light and dark, good and bad, peaceful and
war-like, amiable and wrathful, mild and turbulent, forgiving and
vindictive, God and a strange mixture of man,* but not the Christ of the
Gospels."

Now all these qualities must pertain to Jesus as well as to Christna.
The very fact that Jesus was a man upon the mother's side--even though
he were a *God,* implies as much. His behavior toward the fig-tree, and
his self-contradictions, in *Matthew,* where at one time he promises
peace on earth, and at another the sword, etc., are proofs in this
direction. Undoubtedly this cut was never intended to represent Jesus of
Nazareth. It was Wittoba, as Moor was told, and as moreover the Hindu
*Sacred Scriptures* state, Brahma, the sacrificer who is "at once both
sacrificer and victim"; it is "Brahma, victim in His Son Christna, who
came to die on earth for our salvation, who Himself accomplishes the
solemn sacrifice (of the Sarvameda)." And yet, it is the man Jesus as
well as the man Christna, for both were united to their

Chrestos.

Thus we have either to admit periodical "incarnations," or let
Christianity go as the greatest imposture and plagiarism of the ages!

As to the Jewish *Scriptures,* only such men as the Jesuit de Carriere,
a convenient representative of the majority of the Catholic clergy, can
still command their followers to accept only the chronology established
by the Holy Ghost. It is on the authority of the latter that we learn
that Jacob went, with a family of seventy persons, all told, to settle
in Egypt in A.M. 2298, and that in A.M. 2513--just 215 years
afterward--these seventy persons had so increased that they left Egypt
600,000 fighting men strong, "without counting women and children,"
which, according to the science of statistics, should represent a total
population of between two and three millions!! Natural history affords
no parallel to such fecundity, except in red herrings. After this let
the Christian missionaries laugh, if they can, at Hindu chronology and
computations.

"Happy are those persons, but not to be envied," exclaims Bunsen, "who
have no misgivings about making Moses march out with more than two
millions of people at the end of a popular conspiracy and rising, in the
sunny days of the eighteenth dynasty; who make the Israelites conquer
Kanaan under Joshua, during and previous to the most formidable
campaigns of conquering Pharaohs in that same country. The Egyptian and
Assyrian annals, combined with the historical criticism of the *Bible,*
prove that the exodus could only have taken place under Menephthah, so
that Joshua could not have crossed the Jordan before Easter 1280, the
last campaign of Ramses **III**. in Palestine being in 1281." <span
id="fr_1092"></span>[\*](#fn_1091)

###### <span id="page_559">p. 559</span>

But we must resume the thread of our narrative with Buddha.

Neither he nor Jesus ever wrote one word of their doctrines. We have to
take the teachings of the masters on the testimony of the disciples, and
therefore it is but fair that we should be allowed to judge both
doctrines on their intrinsic value. Where the logical preponderance
lies, may be seen in the results of frequent encounters between
Christian missionaries and Buddhist theologians (*pungui*). The latter
usually, if not invariably, have the better of their opponents. On the
other hand, the "Lama of Jehovah" rarely fails to lose his temper, to
the great delight of the Lama of Buddha, and practically demonstrates
his religion of patience, mercy, and charity, by abusing his disputant
in the most uncanonical language. This we have witnessed repeatedly.

Despite the notable similarity of the direct teachings of Gautama and
Jesus, we yet find their respective followers starting from two
diametrically opposite points. The Buddhist divine, following literally
the ethical doctrine of his master, remains thus true to the legacy of
Gautama; while the Christian minister, distorting the precepts recorded
by the four *Gospels* beyond recognition, teaches, not that which Jesus
taught, but the absurd, too often pernicious, interpretations of
fallible men--Popes, Luthers, and Calvins included. The following are
two instances selected from both religions, and brought into contrast.
Let the reader judge for himself:

"Do not believe in anything because it is rumored and spoken of by
many," says Buddha; "do not think that is a proof of its truth.

"Do not believe merely because the written statement of some old sage is
produced; do not be sure that the writing has ever been revised by the
said sage, or can be relied on. Do not believe in what you have fancied,
thinking that,

because an idea is extraordinary, it must have been implanted by a Deva,
or some wonderful being.

"Do not believe in guesses, that is, assuming something at hap-hazard as
a starting-point, and then drawing conclusions from it--reckoning your
two and your three and your four

before you have fixed your number one.

"*Do not believe merely on the authority of your teachers and masters,*
or believe and practice merely

because they believe and practice.

"I \[Buddha\] tell you all, you must of yourselves know that this is
evil, this is punishable, this is censured by wise men; belief in this
will bring no advantage to any one, but will cause sorrow; and when you
know this, then eschew it." <span id="fr_1093"></span>[\*](#fn_1092)

It is impossible to avoid contrasting with these benevolent and human
sentiments, the fulminations of the OEcumenical Council and the Pope,

###### <span id="page_560">p. 560</span>

against the employment of reason, and the pursuit of science when it
clashes with revelation. The atrocious Papal benediction of Moslem arms
and cursing of the Russian and Bulgarian Christians have roused the
indignation of some of the most devoted Catholic communities. The
Catholic Czechs of Prague on the day of the recent semi-centennial
jubilee of Pius **IX**., and again on the 6th of July, the day sacred to
the memory of John Huss, the burned martyr, to mark their horror of the
Ultramontane policy in this respect, gathered by thousands upon the
neighboring Mount Zhishko, and with great ceremony and denunciations,
burned the Pope's portrait, his Syllabus, and last allocution against
the Russian Czar, saying that they were good Catholics, but better
Slavs. Evidently, the memory of John Huss is more sacred to them than
the Vatican Popes.

"The worship of words is more pernicious than the worship of images,"
remarks Robert Dale Owen. "Grammatolatry is the worst species of
idolatry. We have arrived at an era in which literalism is destroying
faith. . . . The letter killeth." <span
id="fr_1094"></span>[\*](#fn_1093)

There is not a dogma in the Church to which these words can be better
applied than to the doctrine of *transubstantiation.* <span
id="fr_1095"></span>[\*\*](#fn_1094) "Whoso eateth my flesh and drinketh
my blood hath eternal life," Christ is made to say. "This is a hard
saying," repeated his dismayed listeners. The answer *was that of an
initiate.* "Doth this offend you? It is the Spirit that quickeneth; the
flesh profiteth nothing. The words (*remata,* or arcane utterances) that
I speak unto you, they are Spirit and they are Life."

During the Mysteries wine represented Bacchus, and bread Ceres. <span
id="fr_1096"></span>[\*\*\*](#fn_1095)

<span id="page_561">p. 561</span>

The hierophant-initiator presented symbolically before the final
*revelation* wine and bread to the candidate who had to eat and drink of
both in token that the spirit was to quicken matter, *i.e*., the divine
wisdom was to enter into his body through what was to be revealed to
him. Jesus, in his Oriental phraseology, constantly assimilated himself
to the true vine (*John* xv. 1). Furthermore, the hierophant, the
discloser of the Petroma, was called "Father." When Jesus says, "Drink .
. . this is my blood," what else was meant, it was simply a metaphorical
assimilation of himself to the vine, which bears the grape, whose juice
is its blood--wine. It was a hint that as he had himself been initiated
by the "Father," so he desired to initiate others. His "Father" was the
husbandman, himself the vine, his disciples the branches. His followers
being ignorant of the terminology of the Mysteries, wondered; they even
took it as an offense, which is not surprising, considering the Mosaic
injunction against blood.

There is quite enough in the four gospels to show what was the secret
and most fervent hope of Jesus; the hope in which he began to teach, and
in which he died. In his immense and unselfish love for humanity, he
considers it unjust to deprive the many of the results of the knowledge
acquired by the few. This result he accordingly preaches--the unity of a
spiritual God, whose temple is within each of us, and in whom we live as
He lives in us--in Spirit. This knowledge was in the hands of the Jewish
adepts of the school of Hillel and the kabalists. But the "scribes," or
lawyers, having gradually merged into the dogmatism of the dead letter,
had long since separated themselves from the Tanaim, the true spiritual
teachers; and the practical kabalists were more or less persecuted by
the Synagogue. Hence, we find Jesus exclaiming: "Woe unto you lawyers!
*For ye have taken away the key of knowledge* \[the Gnosis\]: ye entered
not in yourselves, and them that were entering ye prevented" (*Luke* xi.
52). The meaning here is clear. They did take the key away, and could
not even profit by it themselves, for the *Masorah* (tradition) had
become a closed book to themselves as well as to others.

###### <span id="page_562">p. 562</span>

Neither Renan nor Strauss, nor the more modern Viscount Amberley seem to
have had the remotest suspicion of the real meaning of many of the
parables of Jesus, or even of the character of the great Galilean
philosopher. Renan, as we have seen, presented him to us as a Gallicized
Rabbi, "*le plus charmant de tous,*" still but a Rabbi; and one,
moreover, who does not even come out of the school of Hillel, or any
school either, albeit he terms him repeatedly "the charming
doctor." <span id="fr_1097"></span>[\*](#fn_1096) He shows him as a
sentimental young enthusiast, sprung out of the plebeian classes of
Galilee, who imagines the ideal kings of his parables the empurpled and
jewelled beings of whom one reads in nursery tales. <span

Lord Amberley's Jesus, on the other hand, is an "iconoclastic idealist,"
far inferior in subtilty and logic to his critics. Renan looks over at
Jesus with the one-sidedness of a Semitomaniac; Viscount Amberley looks
down upon him from the social plane of an English lord. *Apropos* of
this marriage-feast parable, which he considers as embodying "a curious
theory of social intercourse," the Viscount says: "Nobody can object to
charitable individuals asking poor people or invalids *without rank* at
their houses. . . . But we cannot admit that this kind action ought to
be rendered obligatory . . . it is eminently desirable that we should do
exactly what Christ would forbid us doing--namely, invite our neighbors
and be invited by them as circumstances may require. The fear that we
may receive a recompense for the dinner-parties we may give, is surely
chimerical. . . . Jesus, in fact, overlooks entirely the more
intellectual side of society." <span
id="fr_1099"></span>[\*\*\*](#fn_1098) All of which unquestionably shows
that the "Son of God" was no master of social etiquette, nor fit for
"society"; but it is also a fair example of the prevalent misconception
of even his most suggestive parables.

The theory of Anquetil du Perron that the *Bagaved-gita* is an
independent work, as it is absent from several manuscripts of the
*Maha-Bharata,* may be as much a plea for a still greater antiquity as
the reverse. The work is purely metaphysical and ethical, and in a
certain sense it is *anti-Vedic*; so far, at least, that it is in
opposition with many of the later Brahmanical interpretations of the
*Vedas.* How comes it, then, that instead of destroying the work, or, at
least, of sentencing it as uncanonical--an expedient to which the
Christian Church would never have failed to resort--the Brahmans show it
the greatest reverence? Perfectly *unitarian* in its aim, it clashes
with the popular idol-worship. Still, the only precaution taken by the
Brahmans to keep its tenets from becoming too well known, is to preserve
it more secretly than any other

###### <span id="page_563">p. 563</span>

religious book from every caste except the sacerdotal; and, to impose
upon that even, in many cases, certain restrictions. The grandest
mysteries of the Brahmanical religion are embraced within this
magnificent poem; and even the Buddhists recognize it, explaining
certain dogmatic difficulties in their own way. "Be unselfish, subdue
your senses and passions, which obscure reason and lead to deceit," says
Christna to his disciple Arjuna, thus enunciating a purely Buddhistic
principle. "Low men follow examples, great men give them. . . . The soul
ought to free itself from the bonds of action, and act absolutely
according to its divine origin. *There is but one God,* and all other
devotas are inferior, and mere forms (powers) of Brahma or of myself.
*Worship by deeds predominates over that of contemplation.*" <span
id="fr_1100"></span>[\*](#fn_1099)

This doctrine coincides perfectly with that of Jesus himself. <span
id="fr_1101"></span>[\*\*](#fn_1100) Faith alone, unaccompanied by
"works," is reduced to naught in the *Bagaved-gita.* As to the
*Atharva-Veda,* it was and is preserved in such secrecy by the Brahmans,
that it is a matter of doubt whether the Orientalists have a *complete*
copy of it. One who has read what Abbe Dubois says may well doubt the
fact. "Of the last species--the Atharva--there are very few," he says,
writing of the *Vedas,* "and many people suppose they no longer exist.
But the truth is, they do exist, though they conceal themselves with
more caution than the others, from the fear of being suspected to be
initiated in the magic mysteries and other dreaded mysteries which the
work is believed to teach." <span id="fr_1102"></span>[\*\*\*](#fn_1101)

There were even those among the highest *epoptae* of the greater
*Mysteries* who knew nothing of their last and dreaded rite--the
voluntary transfer of life from hierophant to candidate. In
*Ghost-Land <span id="fr_1103"></span>[\*\*\*\*](#fn_1102)* this
mystical operation of the adept's transfer of his spiritual entity,
after the death of his body, into the youth he loves with all the ardent
love of a spiritual parent, is superbly described. As in the case of the
reincarnation of the lamas of Thibet, an adept of the highest order may
live indefinitely. His mortal casket wears out notwithstanding certain
alchemical secrets for prolonging the youthful vigor far beyond the
usual limits, yet the body can rarely be kept alive beyond ten or twelve
score of years. The old garment is then worn out, and the spiritual Ego
forced to leave it, selects for its habitation a new body, fresh and
full of healthy vital principle. In case the reader should feel inclined
to ridicule this asser-

###### <span id="page_564">p. 564</span>

tion of the possible prolongation of human life, we may as well refer
him to the statistics of several countries. The author of an able
article in the *Westminster Review,* for October, 1850, is responsible
for the statement that in England, they have the authentic instances of
one Thomas Jenkins dying at the age of 169, and "Old Parr" at 152; and
that in Russia some of the peasants are "known to have reached 242
years." <span id="fr_1104"></span>[\*](#fn_1103) There are also cases of
centenarianism reported among the Peruvian Indians. We are aware that
many able writers have recently discredited these claims to an extreme
longevity, but we nevertheless affirm our belief in their truth.

True or false there are "superstitions" among the Eastern people such as
have never been dreamed even by an Edgar Poe or a Hoffmann. And these
beliefs run in the very blood of the nations with which they originated.
Carefully stripped of exaggeration they will be found to embody an
universal belief in those restless, wandering, astral souls, which are
called ghouls and vampires. An Armenian Bishop of the fifth century,
named Yeznik, gives a number of such narratives in a manuscript work
(Book i., §§ 20, 30)*,* preserved some thirty years ago in the library
of the Monastery of Etchmeadzine. <span
id="fr_1105"></span>[\*\*](#fn_1104) Among others, there is a tradition
dating from the days of heathendom, that whenever a hero whose life is
needed yet on earth falls on the battle-field, the Aralez, the popular
gods of ancient Armenia, empowered to bring back to life those
slaughtered in battle, lick the bleeding wounds of the victim, and
breathe on them until they have imparted a new and vigorous life. After
that the warrior rises, washes off all traces of his wounds, and resumes
his place in the fray. But his immortal spirit has fled; and for the
remainder of his days he lives--a deserted temple.

Once that an adept was initiated into the last and most solemn mystery
of the life-transfer, the awful *seventh* rite of the great sacerdotal
operation, which is the highest theurgy, he belonged no more to this
world. His soul was free thereafter, and the *seven* mortal sins lying
in wait to devour his heart, as the soul, liberated by death, would be
crossing the *seven* halls and *seven* staircases, could hurt him no
more alive or dead; he has passed the "twice seven trials" the *twelve*
labors of the final hour. <span id="fr_1106"></span>[\*\*\*](#fn_1105)

The High Hierophant alone knew how to perform this solemn operation

###### <span id="page_565">p. 565</span>

by infusing his own vital life and astral soul into the adept, chosen by
him for his successor, who thus became endowed with a double life. <span
id="fr_1107"></span>[\*](#fn_1106)

"Verily, verily, I say unto thee, except a man *be born again,* he
cannot see the kingdom of God" (*John* iii. 3). Jesus tells Nicodemus,
"That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the
spirit is spirit."

This allusion, so unintelligible in itself, is explained in the
*Satapa-Brahmana.* It teaches that a man striving after spiritual
perfection must have *three* births: 1st. Physical from his mortal
parents; 2d. *Spiritual*, through religious sacrifice (initiation); 3d.
His final birth into the world of spirit--at death. Though it may seem
strange that we should have to go to the old land of the Punjab and the
banks of the sacred Ganges, for an interpreter of words spoken in
Jerusalem and expounded on the banks of the Jordan, the fact is evident.
This second birth, or regeneration of spirit, after the natural birth of
that which is born of the flesh, might have astonished a Jewish ruler.
Nevertheless, it had been taught 3,000 years before the appearance of
the great Galilean prophet, not only in old India but to all the
*epoptae* of the Pagan initiation, who were instructed in the great
mysteries of **L**IFE and **D**EATH. This secret of secrets, that *soul*
is not knit to flesh, was practically demonstrated in the instance of
the Yogis, the followers of Kapila. Having emancipated their souls from
the fetters of *Prakriti,* or *Mahat* (the physical perception of the
senses and mind--in one sense, creation), they so developed their
soul-power and *will-force,* as to have actually enabled themselves,
while on earth, to communicate with the supernal worlds, and perform
what is bunglingly termed "miracles." <span
id="fr_1108"></span>[\*\*](#fn_1107) Men whose astral

<span id="page_566">p. 566</span>

spirits have attained on earth the *nehreyasa,* or the *mukti,* are
half-gods; disembodied spirits, they reach Moksha or *Nirvana,* and this
is their *second* spiritual birth.

Buddha teaches the doctrine of a new birth as plainly as Jesus does.
Desiring to break with the ancient Mysteries, to which it was impossible
to admit the ignorant masses, the Hindu reformer, though generally
silent upon more than one secret dogma, clearly states his thought in
several passages. Thus, he says: "*Some people are born again*;
evil-doers go to Hell; righteous people go to Heaven; those who are free
from all worldly desires enter Nirvana" (*Precepts of the Dhammapada,*
v., 126). Elsewhere Buddha states that "it is better to believe in a
future life, in which happiness or misery can be felt; for if the heart
believes therein, it will abandon sin and act virtuously; and even if
there is no resurrection, such a life will bring a good name and the
regard of men. *But those who believe in extinction at death will not
fail to commit any sin* that they may choose, because of their disbelief
in a future." <span id="fr_1109"></span>[\*](#fn_1108)

The *Epistle to the Hebrews* treats of the sacrifice of blood. "Where a
testament is," says the writer, "there must be of necessity *the death*
of the testator. . . . Without the shedding *of blood* is no remission."
Then again: "Christ glorified not himself to *be made High Priest;* but
He that said unto him: Thou art my son; TO-DAY HAVE **I** BEGOTTEN THEE"
(*Heb.* v. 5). This is a very clear inference, that, 1, Jesus was
considered only in the light of a high priest, like Melchisedek--another
*avatar*, or incarnation of Christ, according to the Fathers; and, 2,
that the writer thought that Jesus had become a "Son of God" only at the
moment of his initiation by water; hence, that he was not born a god,
neither was he begotten physically by Him. Every initiate of the "last
hour" became, by the very fact of his initiation, a son of God. When
Maxime, the Ephesian, initiated the Emperor Julian into the Mithraic
Mysteries, he pronounced as the usual formula of the rite, the
following: "By this blood, I wash thee from thy sins. The Word of the
Highest has entered unto thee, and His Spirit henceforth will rest upon
the NEWLY-BORN, *the now*-begotten of the Highest God. . . . Thou art
the son of Mithra." "Thou art the '*Son of God,*' " repeated the
disciples after Christ's baptism. When Paul shook off the viper into the
fire without further injury to himself, the people of Melita said "that
he was *a god*" (*Acts* xxviii.). "He is the son of God, the Beautiful!"
was the term used by the disciples of Simon

###### <span id="page_567">p. 567</span>

Magus, for they thought they recognized the "great power of God" in him.

A man can have no god that is not bounded by his own human conceptions.
The wider the sweep of his spiritual vision, the mightier will be his
deity. But where can we find a better demonstration of Him than in man
himself; in the spiritual and divine powers lying dormant in every human
being? "The very capacity to imagine the possibility of thaumaturgical
powers, is itself evidence that they exist," says the author of
*Prophecy.* "The critic, as well as the skeptic, is generally inferior
to the person or subject that he is reviewing, and, therefore, is hardly
a competent witness. *If there are counterfeits, somewhere there must
have been a genuine* original." <span id="fr_1110"></span>[\*](#fn_1109)

Blood begets phantoms, and its emanations furnish certain spirits with
the materials required to fashion their temporary appearances. "Blood,"
says Levi, "is the first incarnation of the universal fluid; it is the
materialized *vital light.* Its birth is the most marvellous of all
nature's marvels; it lives only by perpetually transforming itself, for
it is the universal Proteus. The blood issues from principles where
there was none of it before, and it becomes flesh, bones, hair, nails .
. . tears, and perspiration. It can be allied neither to corruption nor
death; when life is gone, it begins decomposing; if you know how to
reanimate it, to infuse into it life by a new magnetization of its
globules, life will return to it again. The universal substance, with
its double motion, is the great arcanum of being; blood is the great
arcanum of life."

"Blood," says the Hindu Ramatsariar, "contains all the mysterious
secrets of existence, no living being can exist without. It is profaning
the great work of the Creator to eat blood."

In his turn Moses, following the universal and traditional law, forbids
eating blood.

Paracelsus writes that with the fumes of blood one is enabled to call
forth any spirit we desire to see; for with its emanations it will build
itself an appearance, a *visible* body--only this is sorcery. The
hierophants of Baal made deep incisions all over their bodies and
produced apparitions, objective and tangible, with their own blood. The
followers of a certain sect in Persia, many of whom may be found around
the Russian settlements in Temerchan-Shoura, and Derbent, have their
religious mysteries in which they form a large ring, and whirl round in
a frantic dance. Their temples are ruined, and they worship in large
temporary buildings, securely enclosed, and with the earthen floor
deeply strewn with sand. They are all dressed in long white robes, and
their heads are

###### <span id="page_568">p. 568</span>

bare and closely shaved. Armed with knives, they soon reach a point of
furious exaltation, and wound themselves and others until their garments
and the sand on the floor are soaked with blood. Before the end of the
"Mystery" *every man has a companion,* who whirls round with him.
Sometimes the spectral dancers have *hair on their heads,* which makes
them quite distinct from their unconscious creators. As we have solemnly
promised never to divulge the principal details of this terrible
ceremony (which we were allowed to witness but once), we must leave the
subject. <span id="fr_1111"></span>[\*](#fn_1110)

In the days of antiquity the sorceresses of Thessaly added sometimes to
the blood of a black lamb that of an infant, and by this means evoked
the shadows. The priests were taught the art of calling up the spirits
of the dead, as well as those of the elements, but their mode was
certainly not that of Thessalian sorceresses.

Among the Yakuts of Siberia there is a tribe dwelling on the very
confines of the Transbaikal regions near the river Vitema (eastern
Siberia) which practices sorcery as known in the days of the Thessalian
witches. Their religious beliefs are curious as a mixture of philosophy
and superstition. They have a chief or supreme god Aij-Taion, who did
not create, they say, but only *presides* over the creation of all the
worlds. He lives on the *ninth* heaven, and it is but from the *seventh*
that the other minor gods--his servants--can manifest themselves to
their creatures. This ninth heaven, according to the revelation of the
minor deities (spirits, we suppose), has three suns and three moons, and
the ground of this abode is formed of four lakes (the four cardinal
points) of "soft air" (ether), instead of water. While they offer no
sacrifices to the Supreme Deity, for he needs none, they do try to
propitiate both the good and bad deities, which they respectively term
the "white" and the "black" gods. They do it, because neither of the two
classes are good or bad through personal merit or demerit. As they are
all subject to the Supreme Aij-Taion, and each has to carry on the duty
assigned to him from eternity, they are not responsible for either the
good or evil they produce in this world. The reason given by the Yakuts
for such sacrifices is very curious. Sacrifices, they say, help each
class of gods to perform their mission the better, and so please the
Supreme; and every mortal that helps either of them in performing his
duty must, therefore,

###### <span id="page_569">p. 569</span>

please the Supreme as well, for he will have helped justice to take
place. As the "black" gods are appointed to bring diseases, evils, and
all kinds of calamities to mankind, each of which is a punishment for
some transgression, the Yakuts offer to them "bloody" sacrifices of
animals; while to the "white" they make pure offerings, consisting
generally of an animal consecrated to some special god and taken care of
with great ceremony, as having become sacred. According to their ideas
the souls of the dead become "shadows," and are doomed to wander on
earth, till a certain change takes place either for the better or worse,
which the Yakuts do not pretend to explain. The *light* shadows, *i.e*.,
those of good people, become the guardians and protectors of those they
loved on earth; the "dark" shadows (the wicked) always seek, on the
contrary, to hurt those they knew, by inciting them to crimes, wicked
acts, and otherwise injuring mortals. Besides these, like the ancient
Chaldees, they reckon seven divine *Sheitans* (daemons) or minor gods.
It is during the sacrifices of blood, which take place at night, that
the Yakuts call forth the wicked or *dark* shadows, to inquire of them
what they can do to arrest their mischief; hence, *blood is necessary,*
for without its fumes the ghosts could not make themselves clearly
visible, and would become, according to their ideas, but the more
dangerous, for they would suck it from living persons by their
perspiration. <span id="fr_1112"></span>[\*](#fn_1111) As to the good,
*light* shadows, they need not be called out; besides that, such an act
disturbs them; they can make their presence felt, when needed, without
any preparation and ceremonies.

The blood-evocation is also practiced, although with a different
purpose, in several parts of Bulgaria and Moldavia, especially in
districts in the vicinity of Mussulmans. The fearful oppressions and
slavery to which these unfortunate Christians have been subjected for
centuries has rendered them a thousand-fold more impressible, and at the
same time more superstitious, than those who live in civilized
countries. On every seventh of May the inhabitants of every
Moldavo-Valachian and Bulgarian city or village, have what they term the
"feast of the dead." After sunset, immense crowds of women and men, each
with a lighted wax taper in hand, resort to the burial places, and pray
on the tombs of their departed friends. This ancient and solemn
ceremony, called *Trizna,* is everywhere a reminiscence of primitive
Christian rites, but far more solemn yet, while in Mussulman slavery.
Every tomb is furnished with a kind of cupboard, about half a yard high,
built of four stones, and with hinged double-doors. These closets
contain what is termed the household of the defunct: namely, a few wax
tapers, some

###### <span id="page_570">p. 570</span>

oil and an earthen lamp, which is lighted on that day, and burns for
twenty-four hours. Wealthy people have silver lamps richly chiselled,
and bejewelled images, which are secure from thieves, for in the burial
ground the closets are even left open. Such is the dread of the
population (Mussulman and Christian) of the revenge of the dead that a
thief bold enough to commit any murder, would never dare touch the
property of a dead person. The Bulgarians have a belief that every
Saturday, and especially the eve of Easter Sunday, and until Trinity day
(about seven weeks) the souls of the dead descend on earth, some to beg
forgiveness from those living whom they had wronged; others to protect
and commune with their loved ones. Faithfully following the traditional
rites of their forefathers, the natives on each Saturday of these seven
weeks keep either lamps or tapers lighted. In addition to that, on the
*seventh* of May they drench the tombs with grape wine, and burn incense
around them from sunset to sunrise. With the inhabitants of towns, the
ceremony is limited to these simple observances. With some of the
rustics though, the rite assumes the proportions of a theurgic
evocation. On the eve of Ascension Day, Bulgarian women light a quantity
of tapers and lamps; the pots are placed upon tripods, and incense
perfumes the atmosphere for miles around; while thick white clouds of
smoke envelope each tomb, as though a veil had separated it from the
others. During the evening, and until a little before midnight, in
memory of the deceased, acquaintances and a certain number of mendicants
are fed and treated with wine and *raki* (grape-whiskey), and money is
distributed among the poor according to the means of the surviving
relatives. When the feast is ended, the guests approaching the tomb and
addressing the defunct by name, thank him or her for the bounties
received. When all but the nearest relatives are gone, a woman, usually
the most aged, remains alone with the dead, and--some say--resorts to
the ceremony of invocation.

After fervent prayers, repeated face downward on the grave-mound, more
or less drops of blood are drawn from near the left bosom, and allowed
to trickle upon the tomb. This gives strength to the invisible spirit
which hovers around, to assume for a few instants a visible form, and
whisper his instructions to the Christian theurgist--if he has any to
offer, or simply to "bless the mourner" and then disappear again till
the following year. So firmly rooted is this belief that we have heard,
in a case of family difficulty, a Moldavian woman appeal to her sister
to put off every decision till Ascension-night, when their dead father
*would be able to tell them of* *his will and pleasure in person;* to
which the sister consented as simply as though their parent were in the
next room.

###### <span id="page_571">p. 571</span>

That there are fearful secrets in nature may well be believed when, as
we have seen in the case of the Russian *Znachar,* the sorcerer *cannot*
die until he has passed the word to another, and the hierophants of
White Magic rarely do. It seems as if the dread power of the "Word"
could only be entrusted to one man of a certain district or body of
people at a time. When the Brahmatma was about to lay aside the burden
of physical existence, he imparted his secret to his successor, either
orally, or by a writing placed in a securely-fastened casket which went
into the latter's hands alone. Moses "lays his hands" upon his neophyte,
Joshua, in the solitudes of Nebo and passes away forever. Aaron
initiates Eleazar on Mount Hor, and dies. Siddhartha-Buddha promises his
mendicants before his death to live in him who shall deserve it,
embraces his favorite disciple, whispers in his ear, and dies; and as
John's head lies upon the bosom of Jesus, he is told that he shall
"tarry" until he shall come. Like signal-fires of the olden times,
which, lighted and extinguished by turns upon one hill-top after
another, conveyed intelligence along a whole stretch of country, so we
see a long line of "wise" men from the beginning of history down to our
own times communicating the word of wisdom to their direct successors.
Passing from seer to seer, the "Word" flashes out like lightning, and
while carrying off the initiator from human sight forever, brings the
new initiate into view. Meanwhile, whole nations murder each other in
the name of another "Word," an empty substitute accepted literally by
each, and misinterpreted by all!

We have met few sects which truly practice sorcery. One such is the
Yezidis, considered by some a branch of the Koords, though we believe
erroneously. These inhabit chiefly the mountainous and desolate regions
of Asiatic Turkey, about Mosul, Armenia, and are found even in
Syria, <span id="fr_1113"></span>[\*](#fn_1112) and Mesopotamia. They
are called and known everywhere as devil-worshippers; and most certainly
it is not either through ignorance or mental obscuration that they have
set up the worship and a regular inter-communication with the lowest and
the most malicious of both elementals and elementaries. They recognize
the present wickedness of the chief of the "black powers"; but at the
same time they dread his power, and so try

###### <span id="page_572">p. 572</span>

to conciliate to themselves his favors. He is in an open quarrel with
Allah, they say, but a reconciliation can take place between the two at
any day; and those who have shown marks of their disrespect to the
"black one" now, may suffer for it at some future time, and thus have
both God and Devil against them. This is simply a cunning policy that
seeks to propitiate his Satanic majesty, who is no other than the great
*Tcherno-bog* (the black god) of the Variagi-Russ, the ancient
idolatrous Russians before the days of Vladimir.

Like Wierus, the famous demonographer of the sixteenth century (who in
his *Pseudomonarchia Daemonum* describes and enumerates a regular
infernal court, which has its dignitaries, princes, dukes, nobles, and
officers), the Yezidis have a whole pantheon of devils, and use the
Jakshas, aerial spirits, to convey their prayers and respects to Satan
their master, and the Afrites of the Desert. During their
prayer-meetings, they join hands, and form immense rings, with their
Sheik, or an officiating priest in the middle who claps his hands, and
intones every verse in honor of Sheitan (Satan). Then they whirl and
leap in the air. When the frenzy is at its climax, they often wound and
cut themselves with their daggers, occasionally rendering the same
service to their next neighbors. But their wounds do not heal and
cicatrize as easily as in the case of lamas and holy men; for but too
often they fall victims to these self-inflicted wounds. While dancing
and flourishing high their daggers without unclasping hands--for this
would be considered a sacrilege, and the spell instantly broken, they
coax and praise Sheitan, and entreat him to manifest himself in his
works by "miracles." As their rites are chiefly accomplished during
night, they do not fail to obtain manifestations of various character,
the least of which are enormous globes of fire which take the shapes of
the most uncouth animals.

Lady Hester Stanhope, whose name was for many years a power among the
masonic fraternities of the East, is said to have witnessed, personally,
several of these Yezidean ceremonies. We were told by an *Ockhal,* of
the sect of Druses, that after having been present at one of the
Yezidis' "Devil's masses," as they are called, this extraordinary lady,
so noted for personal courage and daring bravery, fainted, and
notwithstanding her usual Emir's male attire, was recalled to life and
health with the greatest difficulty. Personally, we regret to say, all
our efforts to witness one of these performances failed.

A recent article in a Catholic journal on Nagualism and Voodooism
charges Hayti with being the centre of secret societies, with terrible
forms of initiation and bloody rites, where *human infants are
sacrificed and devoured by the adepts* (!!). Piron, a French traveller,
is quoted at length, describing a most fearful scene witnessed by him in
Cuba, in the

###### <span id="page_573">p. 573</span>

house of a lady whom he never would have suspected of any connection
with so monstrous a sect. "A naked white girl acted as a voodoo
priestess, wrought up to frenzy by dances and incantations that followed
the sacrifice of a white and a black hen. A serpent, trained to its
part, and acted on by the music, coiled round the limbs of the girl, its
motions studied by the votaries dancing around or standing to watch its
contortions. The spectator fled at last in horror when the poor girl
fell writhing in an epileptic fit."

While deploring such a state of things in Christian countries, the
Catholic article in question explains this tenacity for ancestral
religious rites as evidence of the *natural depravity of the human
heart,* and makes a loud call for greater zeal on the part of Catholics.
Besides repeating the absurd fiction about devouring children, the
writer seems wholly insensible to the fact that a devotion to one's
faith that centuries of the most cruel and bloody persecution cannot
quench, makes heroes and martyrs of a people, whereas their conversion
to any other faith would turn them simply into renegades. A compulsory
religion can never breed anything but deceit. The answer received by the
missionary Margil from some Indians supports the above truism. The
question being: "How is it that you are so heathenish after having been
Christians so long?" The answer was: "What would you do, father, if
enemies of your faith entered your land? Would you not take all your
books and vestments and signs of religion and retire to the most secret
caves and mountains? This is just what our priests, and prophets, and
soothsayers, and nagualists have done to this time and are still doing."

Such an answer from a Roman Catholic, questioned by a missionary of
either Greek or Protestant Church, would earn for him the crown of a
saint in the Popish martyrology. Better a "heathen" religion that can
extort from a Francis Xavier such a tribute as he pays the Japanese, in
saying that "in virtue and probity they surpassed all the nations he had
ever seen"; than a Christianity whose advance over the face of the earth
sweeps aboriginal nations out of existence as with a hurricane of
fire. <span id="fr_1114"></span>[\*](#fn_1113) Disease, drunkenness, and
demoralization are the immediate results of apostasy from the faith of
their fathers, and conversion into a religion of mere forms.

sources to inquire. Captain O'Grady, the British ex-official, says: "The
British government is doing a shameful thing in turning the natives of
India from a sober race to a nation of drunkards. And for pure *greed*.
Drinking is forbidden by the religion alike of Hindus and Mussulmans.
But . . . drinking is daily becoming more and more prevalent. . . . What
the accursed opium traffic, forced on China by British greed, has been
to that unhappy country, the government sale of liquor is likely to
become to India. For it is a government monopoly, based on almost
precisely the same model as the government monopoly of tobacco in Spain.
. . . The outside domestics in European families usually get to be
terrible drunkards. . . . The indoor servants usually detest drinking,
and are a good deal more respectable in this particular than their
masters and mistresses . . . everybody drinks . . . bishops, chaplains,
freshly-imported boarding-school girls, and all."

Yes, these are the "blessings" that the modern Christian religion brings
with its *Bibles* and *Catechisms* to the "poor heathen." Rum and
bastardy to Hindustan; opium to China; rum and foul disorders to Tahiti;
and, worst of all, the example of hypocrisy in religion, and a practical
skepticism and atheism, which, since it seems to be good enough for
*civilized* people, may well in time be thought good enough for those
whom theology has too often been holding under a very heavy yoke. On the
other hand, everything that is noble, spiritual, elevating, in the old
religion is denied, and even deliberately falsified.

Take Paul, read the little of original that is left of him in the
writings attributed to this brave, honest, sincere man, and see whether
any one can find a word therein to show that Paul meant by the word
Christ anything more than the abstract ideal of the personal divinity
indwelling in man. For Paul, Christ is not a person, but an embodied
idea. "If any man is in Christ he is a new creation," *he is reborn,* as
after initiation, for the Lord is spirit--the spirit of man. Paul was
the only one of the apostles who had understood the secret ideas
underlying the teachings of Jesus, although he had never met him. But
Paul had been initiated himself; and, bent upon inaugurating a new and
broad reform, one embracing the whole of humanity, he sincerely set his
own doctrines far above the wisdom of the ages, above the ancient
Mysteries and final revelation to the epoptae. As Professor A. Wilder
well proves in a series of able articles, it *was not Jesus, but Paul
who was the real founder of Christianity.* "The disciples were called
Christians first in Antioch," say the *Acts of the Apostles.* "Such men
as Irenaeus, Epiphanius, and Eusebius have transmitted to posterity a
reputation for untruth and dishonest practices; and the heart sickens at
the story of the crimes of that

period," writes this author, in a recent article. <span
id="fr_1115"></span>[\*](#fn_1114) "It will be remembered," he adds,
"that when the Moslems overran Syria and Asia Minor for the first time,
they were welcomed by the Christians of those regions as deliverers from
the intolerable oppression of the ruling authorities of the Church."

Mahomet never was, neither is he now, considered a god; yet under the
stimulus of his name millions of Moslems have served their God with an
ardor that can never be paralleled by Christian sectarianism. That they
have sadly degenerated since the days of their prophet, does not alter
the case in hand, but only proves the more the prevalence of matter over
spirit all over the world. Besides, they have never degenerated more
from primitive faith than Christians themselves. Why, then, should not
Jesus of Nazareth, a thousandfold higher, nobler, and morally grander
than Mahomet, be as well revered by Christians and followed in practice,
instead of being blindly adored in fruitless faith as a god, and at the
same time worshipped much after the fashion of certain Buddhists, who
turn their wheel of prayers. That this faith has become sterile, and is
no more worthy the name of Christianity than the fetishism of Calmucks
that of the philosophy preached by Buddha, is doubted by none. "We would
not be supposed to entertain the opinion," says Dr. Wilder, "that modern
Christianity is in any degree identical with the religion preached by
Paul. It lacks his breadth of view, his earnestness, his keen spiritual
perception. Bearing the impress of the nations by which it is professed,
it exhibits as many forms as there are races. It is one thing in Italy
and Spain, but widely differs in France, Germany, Holland, Sweden, Great
Britain, Russia, Armenia, Kurdistan, and Abyssinia. As compared with the
preceding worships, the change seems to be more in name than in genius.
Men had gone to bed Pagans and awoke Christians. As for the *Sermon on
the Mount,* its conspicuous doctrines are more or less repudiated by
every Christian community of any considerable dimensions. Barbarism,
oppression, cruel punishments, are as common now as in the days of
Paganism.

"The Christianity of Peter exists no more; that of Paul supplanted it,
and was in its turn amalgamated with the other world-religions. When
mankind are enlightened, or the barbarous races and families are
supplanted by those of nobler nature and instincts, the ideal
excellencies may become realities.

"The 'Christ of Paul' has constituted an enigma which evoked the most
strenuous endeavor to solve. He was something else than the Jesus of the
*Gospels.* Paul disregarded utterly their 'endless genealogies.' The

###### <span id="page_576">p. 576</span>

author of the fourth *Gospel,* himself an Alexandrian Gnostic, describes
Jesus as what would now be termed a 'materialized' divine spirit. He was
the Logos, or First Emanation--the Metathron. . . . The 'mother of
Jesus,' like the Princess Maya, Danae, or perhaps Periktione, had given
birth, not to a love-child, but to a divine offspring. No Jew of
whatever sect, no apostle, no early believer, ever promulgated such an
idea. Paul treats of Christ as a personage rather than as a person. The
sacred lessons of the secret assemblies often personified the divine
good and the divine truth in a human form, assailed by the passions and
appetites of mankind, but superior to them; and this doctrine, emerging
from the crypt, was apprehended by churchlings and gross-minded men as
that of immaculate conception and divine incarnation."

In the old book, published in 1693 and written by the Sieur de la
Loubere, French Ambassador to the King of Siam, are related many
interesting facts of the Siamese religion. The remarks of the satirical
Frenchman are so pointed that we will quote his words about the Siamese
Saviour--Sommona-Cadom.

"How marvellous soever they pretend the birth of their Saviour has been,
they cease not to give *him a father and a mother*. <span
id="fr_1116"></span>[\*](#fn_1115) His mother, whose name is found in
some of their *Balie* (Pali?) books, was called, as they say, *Maha*
**M**ARIA, which seems to signify the great Mary, for Maha signifies
great. However it be, this ceases not to give attention to the
missionaries, and has perhaps given occasion to the Siamese to believe
that Jesus being the son of *Mary,* was brother to Sommona-Cadom, and
that, having been crucified, he was that *wicked* brother whom they give
to Sommona-Cadom, under the name of Thevetat, and whom they report to be
punished in Hell, with a punishment which participates something of a
cross. . . . The Siamese expect another Sommona-Cadom, I mean, another
miraculous man like him, whom they already named *Pronarote,* and whom
they say was foretold by Sommona. He made all sorts of miracles. . . .
He had two disciples, both standing on each hand of his idol; one on the
right hand, and the other on the left . . . the first is named
Pra-Magla, and the second *Pra Scaribout*. . . . The father of
Sommona-Cadom was, according to this same *Balie* Book, a King of Teve
Lanca, that is to say, a King of Ceylon. But *the Balie Books being
without date and without the author's name, have no more authority than
all the traditions, whose origin is unknown.*" <span
id="fr_1117"></span>[\*\*](#fn_1116)

###### <span id="page_577">p. 577</span>

This last argument is as ill-considered as it is naively expressed. We
do not know of any book in the whole world less authenticated as to
date, authors' names, or tradition, than our Christian *Bible*. Under
these circumstances the Siamese have as much reason to believe in their
miraculous Sommona-Cadom as the Christians in their miraculously-born
Saviour. Moreover, they have no better right to force their religion
upon the Siamese, or any other people, against their will, and in their
own country, where they go unasked, than the so-called heathen "to
compel France or England to accept Buddhism at the point of the sword."
A Buddhist missionary, even in free-thinking America, would daily risk
being mobbed, but this does not at all prevent missionaries from abusing
the religion of the Brahmans, Lamas, and Bonzes, publicly to their
teeth; and the latter are not always at liberty to answer them. This is
termed diffusing the beneficent light of Christianity and civilization
upon the darkness of heathenism!

And yet we find that these pretensions--which might appear ludicrous
were they not so fatal to millions of our fellow-men, who only ask to be
left alone--were fully appreciated as early as in the seventeenth
century. We find the same witty Monsieur de la Loubere, under a pretext
of pious sympathy, giving some truly curious instructions to the
ecclesiastical authorities at home, <span
id="fr_1118"></span>[\*](#fn_1117) which embody the very soul of
Jesuitism.

"From what I have said concerning the opinions of the Orientals," he
remarks, "it is easy to comprehend how difficult an enterprise it is to
bring them over to the Christian religion; and of what consequence it is
that the missionaries, which preach the Gospel in the East, do perfectly
understand the manners and belief of these people. For as the apostles
and first Christians, when God supported their preaching by so many
wonders, did not on a sudden discover to the heathens all the mysteries
which we adore, but a long time concealed from them, and the Catechumens
themselves, the knowledge of those which might scandalize them; it seems
very rational to me that the missionaries, who have not

###### <span id="page_578">p. 578</span>

the gift of miracles, ought not presently to discover to the Orientals
all the mysteries nor all the practices of Christianity.

"'Twould be convenient, for example, if I am not mistaken, not to preach
unto them, *without great caution,* the worshipping of saints; and as to
the knowledge of Jesus Christ, I think it would be necessary to manage
it with them, if I may so say, and *not to speak to them of the mystery
of the Incarnation,* till after having convinced them of the existence
of a God Creator. For what probability is there, to begin with, of
persuading the Siamese to remove Sommona-Cadom, Pra Mogla, and Pra
Scaribout from the altars, to set up Jesus Christ, St. Peter, and St.
Paul, in their stead? 'Twould, perhaps, be more proper not to preach
unto them Jesus Christ crucified, till they have first comprehended that
one may be *unfortunate* and *innocent*; and that by the rule received,
even amongst them, which is, that the innocent might load himself with
the crimes of the guilty, it was necessary *that a god should become
man,* to the end that this man-God should, by a laborious life, and a
shameful but voluntary death, satisfy for all the sins of men; but
before all things it would be necessary to give them the true idea of a
God Creator, and justly provoked against men. The Eucharist, after this,
will not scandalize the Siamese, as it formerly scandalized the Pagans
of Europe; forasmuch as the Siamese do not believe Sommona-Cadom could
give his wife and children to the Talapoins to eat.

"On the contrary, as the Chinese are respectful toward their parents
even to a scruple, I doubt not that if the Gospel should be presently
put into their hands, they would be scandalized at that place, where,
when some told Jesus Christ that his mother and his brethren asked after
him, he answered in such a manner, that he seems so little to regard
them, that he affected not to know them. They would *not be less
offended* at those other mysterious words, which our divine Saviour
spoke to the young man, who desired time to go and bury his parents:
'Let the dead,' said he, 'bury the dead.' Every one knows the trouble
which the Japanese expressed to St. Francis Xavier *upon the eternity of
damnation,* not being able to believe that their dead parents should
fall into so horrible a misfortune for *want of having embraced
Christianity, which they had never heard of*. . . . It seems necessary,
therefore, to prevent and mollify this thought, by the means which that
great apostle of the Indies used, in first establishing the idea of an
omnipotent, all-wise, and most just God, the author of all good, to whom
only everything is due, and by whose will we owe unto kings, bishops,
magistrates and to our parents the respects which we owe them.

"These examples are sufficient to show with what precautions it is

###### <span id="page_579">p. 579</span>

necessary to prepare the minds of the Orientals to think like us, and
*not to be offended with most* of the articles of the Christian
faith." <span id="fr_1119"></span>[\*](#fn_1118)

And what, we ask, is left to preach? With no Saviour, no atonement, no
crucifixion for human sin, no Gospel, no eternal damnation to tell them
of, and no miracles to display, what remained for the Jesuits to spread
among the Siamese but the dust of the Pagan sanctuaries with which to
blind their eyes? The sarcasm is biting indeed. The morality to which
these poor heathen are made to adhere by their ancestral faith is so
pure, that Christianity has to be stripped of every distinguishing mark
before its priests can venture to offer it for their examination. A
religion that cannot be trusted to the scrutiny of an unsophisticated
people who are patterns of filial piety, of honest dealing, of deep
reverence for God and an instinctive horror of profaning His majesty,
must indeed be founded upon error. That it is so, our century is
discovering little by little.

In the general spoliation of Buddhism to make up the new Christian
religion, it was not to be expected that so peerless a character as
Gautama-Buddha would be left unappropriated. It was but natural that
after taking his legendary history to fill out the blanks left in the
fictitious story of Jesus, after using what they could of Christna's,
they should take the man Sakya-muni and put him in their calendar under
an *alias.* This they actually did, and the Hindu Saviour in due time
appeared on the list of saints as Josaphat, to keep company with those
martyrs of religion, **SS**. Aura and Placida, Longinus and Amphibolus.

In Palermo there is even a church dedicated to *Divo Josaphat.* Among
the vain attempts of subsequent ecclesiastical writers to fix the
genealogy of this mysterious saint, the most original was the making him
Joshua, the son of Nun. But these trifling difficulties being at last
surmounted, we find the history of Gautama copied *word for word* from
Buddhist sacred books, into the *Golden Legend.* Names of individuals

###### <span id="page_580">p. 580</span>

are changed, the place of action, India, remains the same--in the
Christian as in the Buddhist Legends. It can be also found in the
*Speculum Historiale* of Vincent of Beauvais, which was written in the
thirteenth century. The first discovery is due to the historian de
Couto, although Professor Muller credits the first recognition of the
identity of the two stories to M. Laboulaye, in 1859. Colonel Yule tells
us that <span id="fr_1120"></span>[\*](#fn_1119) these stories of
Barlaam and Josaphat, are recognized by Baronius, and are to be found at
p. 348, of *The Roman Martyrology,* set forth by command of Pope Gregory
**XIII**., and revised by the authority of Pope Urban **VIII**.,
translated out of Latin into English by G. K. of the Society of
Jesus. <span id="fr_1121"></span>[\*\*](#fn_1120)

To repeat even a small portion of this ecclesiastical nonsense would be
tedious and useless. Let him who doubts and who would learn the story
read it as given by Colonel Yule. Some <span
id="fr_1122"></span>[\*\*\*](#fn_1121) of the Christian and
ecclesiastical speculations seem to have embarrassed even Dominie
Valentyn. "There be some, who hold this Budhum for a fugitive Syrian
Jew," he writes; "others who hold him for a disciple of the Apostle
Thomas; but how in that case he could have been born 622 years before
Christ I leave them to explain. Diego de Couto stands by the belief that
he was certainly *Joshua,* which is still more absurd!"

"The religious romance called *The History of Barlaam and Josaphat* was,
for several centuries, one of the most popular works in Christendom,"
says Col. Yule. "It was translated into all the chief European
languages, including Scandinavian and Sclavonic tongues. . . . This
story first appears among the works of St. John of Damascus, a
theologian of the early part of the eighth century." <span
id="fr_1123"></span>[\*\*\*\*](#fn_1122) Here then lies the secret of
its origin, for this St. John, before he became a divine, held a high
office at the court of the Khalif Abu Jafar Almansur, where he probably
learned the story, and afterwards adapted it to the new orthodox
necessities of the Buddha turned into a Christian saint.

Having repeated the plagiarized story, Diego de Couto, who seems to
yield up with reluctance his curious notion that Gautama was Joshua,
says: "To this name (Budao) the Gentiles throughout all India have
dedicated great and superb pagodas. With reference to this story, we
have been diligent in inquiring if the ancient Gentiles of those parts
had in their writings any knowledge of St. Josaphat who was converted by
Balaam, and who in his legend is represented as the son of a great king
of India, and who had just the same up-bringing, with all the same
particulars that we have recounted of the life of the Budao. And as I
was

###### <span id="page_581">p. 581</span>

travelling in the Isle of Salsette, and went to see that rare and
admirable pagoda, which we call the Canara Pagoda (Kanhari Caves) made
in a mountain, with many halls cut out of one solid rock, and inquiring
of an old man about the work, what he thought as to who had made it, he
told us that without doubt the work was made by order of the father of
St. Josaphat to bring him up in seclusion, as the story tells. And as it
informs us that he was the son of a great king in India, it may well be,
as we have just said, that *he* was the Budao, of whom they relate such
marvels." <span id="fr_1124"></span>[\*](#fn_1123)

The Christian legend is taken, moreover, in most of its details, from
the Ceylonese tradition. It is on this island that originated the story
of young Gautama rejecting his father's throne, and the king's erecting
a superb palace for him, in which he kept him half prisoner, surrounded
by all the temptations of life and wealth. Marco Polo told it as he had
it from the Ceylonese, and his version is now found to be a faithful
repetition of what is given in the various Buddhist books. As Marco
naively expresses it, Buddha led a life of such hardship and sanctity,
and kept such great abstinence, "*just as if he had been a Christian.*
Indeed*,*" he adds, "had he but been so, he would have been a great
saint of our Lord Jesus Christ, so good and pure was the life he led."
To which pious apothegm his editor very pertinently remarks that "Marco
is not the only eminent person who has expressed this view of
Sakya-muni's life in such words." And in his turn Prof. Max Muller says:
"And whatever we may think of the sanctity of saints, let those who
doubt the right of Buddha to a place among them, read the story of his
life as it is told in the Buddhistical canon. If he lived the life which
is there described, few saints have a better claim to the title than
Buddha; and no one either in the Greek or the Roman Church need be
ashamed of having paid to his memory the honor that was intended for St.
Josaphat, the prince, the hermit, and the saint."

The Roman Catholic Church has never had so good a chance to Christianize
all China, Thibet, and Tartary, as in the thirteenth century, during the
reign of Kublai-Khan. It seems strange that they did not embrace the
opportunity when Kublai was hesitating at one time between the four
religions of the world, and, perhaps through the eloquence of Marco
Polo, favored Christianity more than either Mahometanism, Judaism, or
Buddhism. Marco Polo and Ramusio, one of his interpreters, tell us why.
It seems that, unfortunately for Rome, the embassy of Marco's father and
uncle failed, because Clement **IV**. happened to die just at that very
time. There was no Pope for several months to

###### <span id="page_582">p. 582</span>

receive the friendly overtures of Kublai-Khan; and thus the one hundred
Christian missionaries invited by him could not be sent to Thibet and
Tartary. To those who believe that there is an intelligent Deity above
who takes a certain concern in the welfare of our miserable little
world, this *contretemps* must in itself seem a pretty good proof that
Buddhism should have the best of Christianity. Perhaps--who knows--Pope
Clement fell sick so as to save the Buddhists from sinking into the
idolatry of Roman Catholicism?

From pure Buddhism, the religion of these districts has degenerated into
lamaism; but the latter, with all its blemishes--purely formalistic and
impairing but little the doctrine itself--is yet far above Catholicism.
The poor Abbe Huc very soon found it out for himself. As he moved on
with his caravan, he writes--"every one repeated to us that, as we
advanced toward the west, we should find the doctrines growing more
luminous and sublime. Lha-Ssa was the great focus of light, the rays
from which became weakened as they were diffused." One day he gave to a
Thibetan lama "a brief summary of Christian doctrine, which appeared by
no means unfamiliar to him \[we do not wonder at that\], and he even
maintained that it \[Catholicism\] did not differ much from the faith of
the grand lamas of Thibet. . . . These words of the Thibetan lama
astonished us not a little," writes the missionary; "the unity of God,
the mystery of the Incarnation, the dogma of the real presence, appeared
to us in his belief. . . . The new light thrown on the religion of
Buddha induced us really to believe that we should find among the lamas
of Thibet a more purified system." <span
id="fr_1125"></span>[\*](#fn_1124) It is these words of praise to
lamaism, with which Huc's book abounds, that caused his work to be
placed on the Index at Rome, and himself to be unfrocked.

When questioned why, since he held the Christian faith to be the best of
the religions protected by him, he did not attach himself to it, the
answer given by Kublai-Khan is as suggestive as it is curious:

"How would you have me to become a Christian? There are four prophets
worshipped and revered by all the world. The Christians say their God is
Jesus Christ; the Saracens, Mahomet; the Jews, Moses; the idolaters,
Sogomon Borkan (Sakya-muni Burkham, or Buddha), who was the first god
among the idols; and I worship and pay respect to all four, and pray
that he among them who is greatest in heaven in very truth may aid me."

We may ridicule the Khan's prudence; we cannot blame him for trustingly
leaving the decision of the puzzling dilemma to Providence itself. One
of his most unsurmountable objections to embrace Christianity

###### <span id="page_583">p. 583</span>

he thus specifies to Marco: "You see that the Christians of these parts
are so ignorant that they achieve nothing and can achieve nothing,
whilst you see the idolaters can do anything they please, insomuch that
when I sit at table, the cups from the middle of the hall come to me
full of wine or other liquor, without being touched by anybody, and I
drink from them. They control storms, causing them to pass in whatever
direction they please, and do many other marvels; whilst, as you know,
their idols speak, and give them predictions on whatever subjects they
choose. But if I were to turn to the faith of Christ and become a
Christian, then my barons and others who are not converted, would say:
'What has moved you to be baptized? . . . What powers or miracles have
you witnessed on the part of Christ? You know the idolaters here say
that their wonders are performed by the sanctity and power of their
idols.' Well, I should not know what answer to make, so they would only
be confirmed in their errors, and the idolaters, who are adepts in such
surprising arts, would easily compass my death. But now you shall go to
your Pope, and pray him on my part to send hither an hundred men skilled
in your law; and if they are capable of rebuking the practices of
idolaters to their faces, and of proving to them *that they too know how
to do such things, but will not,* because they are done by the help of
the Devil and other evil spirits; and if they so control the idolaters
that these shall have no power to perform such things in their presence,
*and when we shall witness this,* we will denounce the idolaters and
their religion, and then I will receive baptism, and then all my barons
and chiefs shall be baptized also, and thus, in the end, there will be
more Christians here than exist in your part of the world." <span
id="fr_1126"></span>[\*](#fn_1125)

The proposition was fair. Why did not the Christians avail themselves of
it? Moses is said to have faced such an ordeal before Pharaoh, and come
off triumphant.

To our mind, the logic of this uneducated Mongol was unanswerable, his
intuition faultless. He saw good results in all religions, and felt
that, whether a man be Buddhist, Christian, Mahometan, or Jew, his
spiritual powers might equally be developed, his faith equally lead him
to the highest truth. All he asked before making choice of a creed for
his people, was the evidence upon which to base faith.

To judge alone by its jugglers, India must certainly be better
acquainted with alchemy, chemistry, and physics than any European
academy. The psychological wonders produced by some fakirs of Southern
Hindustan, and by the shaberons and hobilhans of Thibet and Mongolia,
alike prove our case. The science of psychology has there reached an
acme of perfection

###### <span id="page_584">p. 584</span>

never attained elsewhere in the annals of the marvellous. That such
powers are not alone due to study, but are natural to every human being,
is now proved in Europe and America by the phenomena of mesmerism and
what is termed "spiritualism." If the majority of foreign travellers,
and residents in British India, are disposed to regard the whole as
clever jugglery, not so with a few Europeans who have had the rare luck
to be admitted *behind the veil* in the pagodas. Surely these will not
deride the rites, nor undervalue the phenomena produced in the secret
lodges of India. The *mahadthevassthanam* of the pagodas (usually termed
*goparam,* from the sacred pyramidal gateway by which the buildings are
entered) has been known to Europeans before now, though to a mere
handful in all.

We do not know whether the prolific Jacolliot <span
id="fr_1127"></span>[\*](#fn_1126) was ever admitted into one of these
lodges. It is extremely doubtful, we should say, if we may judge from
his many fantastic tales of the immoralities of the mystical rites among
the Brahmans, the fakirs of the pagodas, and even the Buddhists (!!) at
all of which he makes himself figure as a Joseph. Anyhow, it is evident
that the Brahmans taught him no secrets, for speaking of the fakirs and
their wonders, he remarks, "under the direction of initiated Brahmans
they practice in the seclusion of the pagodas, the *occult sciences*. .
. . And let no one be surprised at this word, which seems to open the
door of the supernatural; while there are in the sciences which the
Brahmans call occult, phenomena so extraordinary as to baffle all
investigation, there is not one which cannot be explained, and which is
not subject to natural law."

Unquestionably, any initiated Brahman could, if he would, explain every
phenomenon. But *he will not*. Meanwhile, we have yet to see an
explanation by the best of our physicists of even the most trivial
occult phenomenon produced by a fakir-pupil of a pagoda.

Jacolliot says that it will be quite impracticable to give an account of
the marvellous facts witnessed by himself. But adds, with entire
truthfulness, "let it suffice to say, that in regard to magnetism and
spiritism, Europe

###### <span id="page_585">p. 585</span>

has yet to stammer over the first letters of the alphabet, and that the
Brahmans have reached, in these two departments of learning, results in
the way of phenomena that are truly stupefying. When one sees these
strange manifestations, whose power one cannot deny, without grasping
the laws that the Brahmans *keep so carefully concealed,* the mind is
overwhelmed with wonder, and one feels that he must run away and break
the charm that holds him."

"The only explanation that we have been able to obtain on the subject
from a learned Brahman, with whom we were on terms of the closest
intimacy, was this: 'You have studied physical nature, and you have
obtained, through the laws of nature, marvellous results--steam,
electricity, etc.; *for twenty thousand years or more, we have studied*
the *intellectual* forces, we have discovered their laws, and *we
obtain, by making them act alone or in concert with matter, phenomena
still more astonishing than your own.*' "

Jacolliot must indeed have been stupefied by wonders, for he says: "We
have seen things such as one does not describe for fear of making his
readers doubt his intelligence . . . but still we have seen them. And
truly one comprehends how, in presence of such facts, the ancient world
believed . . . in possessions of the Devil and in exorcism." <span
id="fr_1128"></span>[\*](#fn_1127)

But yet this uncompromising enemy of priestcraft, monastic orders, and
the clergy of every religion and every land--including Brahmans, lamas,
and fakirs--is so struck with the contrast between the fact-supported
cults of India, and the empty pretences of Catholicism, that after
describing the terrible self-tortures of the fakirs, in a burst of
honest indignation, he thus gives vent to his feelings: "Nevertheless,
these fakirs, these mendicant Brahmans, have still something grand about
them: when they flagellate themselves, when during the self-inflicted
martyrdom the flesh is torn out by bits, the blood pours upon the
ground. But you (Catholic mendicants), what do you do to-day? You, Gray
Friars, Capuchins, Franciscans, who play at fakirs, with your knotted
cords, your flints, your hair shirts, and your rose-water flagellations,
your bare feet and your comical mortifications--fanatics without faith,
martyrs without tortures? Has not one the right to ask you, if it is to
obey the law of God that you shut yourselves in behind thick walls, and

. . . Away, you are only beggars!"

Let them pass on--we have devoted too much space to them and their
conglomerate theology, already. We have weighed both in the balance of
history, of logic, of truth, and found them wanting. Their

###### <span id="page_586">p. 586</span>

system breeds atheism, nihilism, despair, and crime; its priests and
preachers are unable to prove by works their reception of divine power.
If both Church and priest could but pass out of the sight of the world
as easily as their names do now from the eye of our reader, it would be
a happy day for humanity. New York and London might then soon become as
moral as a heathen city unoccupied by Christians; Paris be cleaner than
the ancient Sodom. When Catholic and Protestant would be as fully
satisfied as a Buddhist or Brahman that their every crime would be
punished, and every good deed rewarded, they might spend upon their own
*heathen* what now goes to give missionaries long picnics, and to make
the name of Christian hated and despised by every nation outside the
boundaries of Christendom.

--------

As occasion required, we have reinforced our argument with descriptions
of a few of the innumerable phenomena witnessed by us in different parts
of the world. The remaining space at our disposal will be devoted to
like subjects. Having laid a foundation by elucidating the philosophy of
occult phenomena, it seems opportune to illustrate the theme with facts
that have occurred under our own eye, and that may be verified by any
traveller. Primitive peoples have disappeared, but primitive wisdom
survives, and is attainable by those who "will," "dare," and can "keep
silent."

<span id="fn_1061"></span>[546:\*\*](iu110.htm#fr_1062) This is the
doctrine of the Supralapsarians, who asserted that "He \[God\]
*predestinated the fall of Adam,* with all its pernicious consequences,
from all eternity, and that our first parents had no liberty from the
beginning."

It is also to this highly-moral doctrine that the Catholic world became
indebted, in the eleventh century, for the institution of the Order
known as the Carthusian monks. Bruno, its founder, was driven to the
foundation of this monstrous Order by a circumstance well worthy of
being recorded here, as it graphically illustrates this *divine*
predestination. A friend of Bruno, a French physician, famed far and
wide for his extraordinary *piety, purity of morals,* and *charity,*
died, and his body was watched by Bruno himself. Three days after his
death, and as he was going to be buried, the pious physician suddenly
sat up in his coffin and declared, in a loud and solemn voice, "that by
the <span id="page_547">p. 547</span> just judgment of God he was
eternally damned." After which consoling message from beyond the "dark
river," he fell back and relapsed into death.

In their turn, the Parsi theologians speak thus: "If any of you commit
sin under the belief that he shall be saved by *somebody,* both the
deceiver as well as the deceived shall be damned to the day of Rasta
Khez. . . . There is no Saviour. In the other world you shall receive
the return according to your actions. . . . *Your Saviour is* *your
deeds* and God Himself.  <span id="fr_1063"></span>[1](#fn_1062)

some records which show the language and religious worship of the
Egyptians, for instance, not only existing at the opening of the old
Empire, "but already so fully established and fixed as to receive *but*
*a very slight development* in the course of the old, middle, and modern
Empires," and while this opening of the old Empire is placed by him
beyond the Menes period, at least 4,000 years B.C., the origin of the
ancient Hermetic prayers and hymns of the "Book of the Dead," is
assigned by Bunsen to the pre-Menite dynasty of Abydos (between 4,000
and 4,500 B.C.), thus showing that "the system of Osirian worship and
mythology was already formed 3,000 years before the days of Moses."

<span id="fn_1074"></span>[550:\*\*\*\*\*](iu110.htm#fr_1075) Moses was
a most notable practitioner of Hermetic Science. Bearing in mind that
Moses (Asarsiph) is made to run away to the Land of Midian, and that he
"sat down by a well" (Exod. ii.), we find the following:

The "Well" played a prominent part in the Mysteries of the Bacchic
festivals. In the sacerdotal language of every country, it had the same
significance. A well is "the fountain of salvation" mentioned in
*Isaiah* (xii*.* 3). The water is the *male* *principle* in its
spiritual sense. In its physical relation in the allegory of creation,
the water is chaos, and chaos is the female principle vivified by the
Spirit of God--the male principle. In the "Kabala," *Zachar* means
"male"; and the Jordan was called Zachar ("Universal History," vol. ii.,
p. 429). It is curious that the Father of St. John the Baptist, the
Prophet of *Jordan--*Zacchar--should be called *Zachar-ias.* One of the
names of Bacchus is *Zagreus.* The ceremony of pouring water on the
shrine was sacred in the Osirian rites as well as in the Mosaic
institutions. In the *Mishna* it is said, "Thou shalt dwell in Succa and
*pour out water* seven, and the pipes six days" ("Mishna Succah," p. 1).
"Take *virgin earth* . . . and work up the *dust* with *living* <span
id="page_551">p. 551</span> WATER," prescribes the *Sohar* (Introduction
to "Sohar"; "Kabbala Denudata," ii., pp. 220, 221). Only "earth and
water, according to Moses, can bring forth a *living soul,*" quotes
Cornelius Agrippa. The water of Bacchus was considered to impart the
Holy *Pneuma* to the initiate; and it washes off all sin by baptism
through the Holy *Ghost,* with the Christians. The "well" in the
kabalistic sense, is the mysterious emblem of the *Secret Doctrine.* "If
any man thirst, let him come *unto me and drink*," says Jesus (John
vii.).

Therefore, Moses the adept, is naturally enough represented sitting by a
well. He is approached by the *seven* daughters of the Kenite Priest of
Midian coming to fill the troughs, *to water their father's flock.* Here
we have seven again--the mystic number. In the present biblical allegory
the daughters represent the *seven occult powers.* "The shepherds came
and drove them (the seven daughters) away, but Moses stood up, and
helped them, and watered their flock." The shepherds are shown, by some
kabalistic interpreters, to represent the seven "badly-disposed
Stellars" of the Nazarenes; for in the old Samaritan text the number of
these Shepherds is also said to be seven (see kabalistic books).

Then Moses, who had conquered the seven *evil* Powers, and won the
friendship of the seven *occult* and beneficent ones, is represented as
living with the Reuel Priest of Midian, who invites "the Egyptian" to
eat bread, *i.e*., to partake of his wisdom. In the Bible the elders of
Midian are known as great soothsayers and diviners. Finally, Reuel or
Jethro, the initiator and instructor of Moses, gives him in marriage his
daughter. This daughter is Zipporah, *i.e*., the esoteric Wisdom, the
shining light of knowledge, for Siprah means the "shining" or
"resplendent," from the word "Sapar" to shine. Sippara, in Chaldea, was
the city of the "Sun." Thus Moses was initiated by the Midianite, or
rather the Kenite, and thence the biblical allegory.

impossibility *of transubstantiation,* the various modes of fulsome
idolatry and lying impostures, the uncertainty of their loyalty to their
lawful sovereigns by their superstitious adhesion to the spiritual
tyranny of the Pope, and that *barbarous and ferine cruelty* *against
those* that are not either such fools as to be persuaded to believe such
things as they would obtrude upon men, or, are not so false to God and
their own consciences, as, knowing better, yet to profess them"
(Postscript to "Glanvill").

<span id="fn_1095"></span>[560:\*\*\*](iu110.htm#fr_1096) Payne Knight
believes that Ceres was not a personification of the brute matter which
composed the earth, but of the female *productive principle* supposed to
pervade it, which, joined to the active, was held to be the cause of the
organization and animation of its substance. . . . She is mentioned as
the wife of the Omnipotent Father, AEther, or Jupiter ("The Symbolical
Language of Ancient Art and Mythology," xxxvi.). Hence the word, of
Christ, "it is the Spirit that quickeneth, *flesh profiteth nothing,*"
applied in their dual meaning to both spiritual and terrestrial things,
to spirit and matter.

Bacchus, as Dionysus, is of Indian origin. Cicero mentions him as a son
of Thyone and Nisus. Διονυσος means the god Dis from Mount Nys in India.
Bacchus, crowned <span id="page_561">p. 561</span> with ivy, or
*kissos,* is Christna, one of whose names was *Kissen.* Dionysus is
preeminently the deity on whom were centred all the hopes for future
life; in short, he was the god who was expected to *liberate the souls
of men* from their prisons of flesh. Orpheus, the poet-Argonaut, is also
said to have come on earth to purify the religion of its gross, and
terrestrial anthropomorphism, he abolished human sacrifice and
instituted a mystic theology based on pure spirituality. Cicero calls
Orpheus a son of Bacchus. It is strange that both seem to have
originally come from India. At least, as Dionysus Zagreus, Bacchus is of
undoubted Hindu origin. Some writers deriving a curious analogy between
the name of Orpheus and an old Greek term, ορφος, *dark or
tawny-colored,* make him Hindu by connecting the term with his dusky
Hindu complexion. See Voss, Heyne and Schneider on the Argonauts.

<span id="fn_1106"></span>[565:\*](iu110.htm#fr_1107) The atrocious
custom subsequently introduced among the people, of sacrificing human
victims, is a perverted copy of the Theurgic Mystery. The Pagan priests,
who did not belong to the class of the hierophants, carried on for
awhile this hideous rite, and it served to screen the genuine purpose.
But the Grecian Herakles is represented as the adversary of human
sacrifices and as slaying the men and monsters who offered them. Bunsen
shows, by the very absence of any representation of human sacrifice on
the oldest monuments, that this custom had been abolished in the old
Empire, at the close of the seventh century after Menes; therefore,
3,000 years B.C., Iphicrates had stopped the human sacrifices entirely
among the Carthaginians. Diphilus ordered bulls to be substituted for
human victims. Amosis forced the priests to replace the latter by
figures of wax. On the other hand, for every stranger offered on the
shrine of Diana by the inhabitants of the Tauric Chersonesus, the
Inquisition and the Christian clergy can boast of a dozen of heretics
offered on the altar of the "mother of God," and her "Son." And when did
the Christians ever think of substituting either animals or wax-figures
for living heretics, Jews, and witches? They burned these in effigy only
when, through providential interference, the doomed victims had escaped
their clutches.

<span id="fn_1107"></span>[565:\*\*](iu110.htm#fr_1108) This is why
Jesus recommends prayer in the solitude of one's closet. This secret
prayer is but the *paravidya* of the Vedantic philosopher: "He who knows

the region of *Swarga* (the heavenly realm) in his own heart," says the
*Brihad-Aranyaka.* The Vedantic philosopher recognizes the Atman, the
spiritual *self,* as the sole and Supreme God.

theirs, and simply is, Adi--the God of wisdom or the Parsi Ab-ad the
first ancestor of the human race, or again Adh-Buddha of the Hindus,
anthropomorphized and degenerated.

four months we have collected from the daily papers forty-seven cases of
crime, ranging from drunkenness up to murder, committed by ecclesiastics
in the United States only. By the end of the year our correspondents in
the East will have valuable facts to offset missionary denunciations of
"heathen" misdemeanors.

been fully established for these Pali Books in our own century;
sufficiently so, at least, to show that they existed in Ceylon, 316
B.C., when Mahinda, the son of Asoka, was there (See Max Muller, "Chips,
etc.," vol. i., on Buddhism).

<span id="fn_1117"></span>[577:\*](iu110.htm#fr_1118) "A New Historical
Relation of the Kingdom of Siam," by M. de la Loubere, Envoy to Siam
from France, 1687-8, chap. xxv., London; "Diverse Observations to be
Made in Preaching the Gospel to the Orientals."

The Sieur de la Loubere's report to the king was made, as we see, in
1687-8. How thoroughly his proposition to the Jesuits, to suppress and
dissemble in preaching Christianity to the Siamese, met their approval,
is shown in the passage elsewhere quoted from the Thesis propounded by
the Jesuits of Caen ("Thesis propugnata in regio Soc. Jes. Collegio,
celeberrimae Academiae Cadoniensis," die Veneris, 30 Jan., 1693), to the
following effect: ". . . neither do the Fathers of the Society of Jesus
dissemble *when they adopt the institute and the habit* of the Talapoins
of Siam." In five years the Ambassador's little lump of leaven had
leavened the whole.

<span id="fn_1118"></span>[579:\*](iu110.htm#fr_1119) In a discourse of
Hermes with Thoth, the former says: "It is impossible for thought to
rightly conceive of God. . . . One cannot describe, through material
organs, that which is immaterial and eternal. . . . One is a perception
of the spirit, the other a reality. That which can be perceived by our
senses can be described in words; but that which is incorporeal,
invisible, immaterial, and without form cannot be realized through our
ordinary senses. I understand thus, O Thoth, I understand that God is
ineffable."

In the *Catechism of the Parsis,* as translated by M. Dadabhai Naoroji,
we read the following:

"Q. What is the form of our God?"

"A. Our God has neither face nor form, color nor shape, nor fixed place.
There is no other like Him. He is Himself, singly such a glory that we
cannot praise or describe Him; nor our mind comprehend Him."

<span id="fn_1126"></span>[584:\*](iu110.htm#fr_1127) His twenty or more
volumes on Oriental subjects are indeed a curious conglomerate of truth
and fiction. They contain a vast deal of fact about Indian traditions,
philosophy and chronology, with most just views courageously expressed.
But it seems as if the philosopher were constantly being overlaid by the
romancist. It is as though two men were united in their authorship--one
careful, serious, erudite, scholarly, the other a sensational and
sensual French romancer, who judges of facts not as they are but as *he*
imagines them. His translations from *Manu* are admirable; his
controversial ability marked; his views of priestly morals unfair, and
in the case of the Buddhists, positively slanderous. But in all the
series of volumes there is not a line of dull reading; he has the eye of
the artist, the pen of the poet of nature.
