IN that famous work of Bodin, on sorcery, <span
id="fr_85"></span>[\*](#fn_85) a frightful story is told about Catherine
of Medicis. The author was a learned publicist, who, during twenty years
of his life, collected authentic documents from the archives of nearly
every important city of France, to make up a complete work on sorcery,
magic, and the power of various "demons." To use an expression of
Eliphas Levi, his book offers a most remarkable collection of "bloody
and hideous facts; acts of revolting superstition, arrests, and
executions of stupid ferocity." "Burn every body!" the Inquisition
seemed to say--God will easily sort out His own! Poor fools, hysterical
women, and idiots were roasted alive, without mercy, for the crime of
"magic." But, "at the same time, how many great culprits escaped this
unjust and sanguinary *justice*! This is what Bodin makes us fully
appreciate."

Catherine, the pious Christian--who has so well deserved in the eyes of
the Church of Christ for the atrocious and never-to-be-forgotten
massacre of St. Bartholomew--the Queen Catherine, kept in her service an
apostate Jacobin priest. Well versed in the "black art," so fully
patronized by the Medici family, he had won the gratitude and protection
of his pious mistress, by his unparalleled skill in killing people at a
distance, by torturing with various incantations their wax simulacra.
The process has been described over and over again, and we scarcely need
repeat it.

Charles was lying sick of an incurable disease. The queen-mother, had
everything to lose in case of his death, resorted to necromancy,
consulted the oracle of the "bleeding head." This infernal operation
required the decapitation of a child who must be possessed of great
beauty and purity. He had been prepared in secret for his first
communion, by *the chaplain* of the palace, who was apprised of the
plot, and at midnight of the appointed day, in the chamber of the sick
man, and in presence only of Catherine and a few of her confederates,
the "devil's mass" was celebrated. Let us give the rest of the story as
we find it in one of Levi's works: "At this mass, celebrated before the
image of the demon, having under his feet a reversed cross, the sorcerer
consecrated two wafers, one black and one white. The white was given to
the child, whom they brought clothed as for baptism, and who was
murdered upon the very steps of the altar, immediately after his
communion. His head, separated from the trunk by a single blow, was
placed, all palpitating, upon the great black wafer which covered the
bottom of the paten, then placed upon a table where some mysterious
lamps were burning. The exorcism then began, and the demon was charged
to pronounce an oracle, and reply by the mouth of this head to a secret
question that the king dared not speak aloud, and that had been confided
to no one. Then a feeble voice, a strange voice, which had nothing of
human character about it, made itself audible in this poor little
martyr's head." The sorcery availed nothing; the king died,
and--Catherine remained the faithful daughter of Rome!

How strange, that des Mousseaux, who makes such free use of Bodin's
materials to construct his formidable indictment against Spiritualists
and other sorcerers, should have overlooked this interesting episode!

It is a well-attested fact that Pope Sylvester **II**. was publicly
accused by Cardinal Benno with being a sorcerer and an enchanter. The
brazen "oracular head" made by his Holiness was of the same kind as the
one fabricated by Albertus Magnus. The latter was smashed to pieces by
Thomas Aquinas, not because it was the work of or inhabited by a
"demon," but because the spook who was fixed inside, by mesmeric power,
talked incessantly, and his verbiage prevented the eloquent saint from
working out his mathematical problems. These heads and other talking
statues, trophies of the magical skill of monks and bishops, were
fac-similes of the "animated" gods of the ancient temples. The
accusation against the Pope was proved at the time. It was also
demonstrated that he was constantly attended by "demons" or spirits. In
the preceding chapter we have mentioned Benedict **IX**., John **XX**.,
and the **VI**th and **VII**th Gregory, who were all known as magicians.
The latter Pope, moreover, was the famous Hildebrand, who was said to
have

###### <span id="page_57">p. 57</span>

been so expert at "shaking lightning out of his sleeve." An expression
which makes the venerable spiritualistic writer, Mr. Howitt, think that
"it was the origin of the celebrated thunder of the Vatican."

The magical achievements of the Bishop of Ratisbon and those of the
"angelic doctor," Thomas Aquinas, are too well known to need repetition;
but we may explain farther how the "illusions" of the former were
produced. If the Catholic bishop was so clever in making people believe
on a bitter winter night that they were enjoying the delights of a
splendid summer day, and cause the icicles hanging from the boughs of
the trees in the garden to seem like so many tropical fruits, the Hindu
magicians also practice such biological powers unto this very day, and
claim the assistance of neither god nor devil. Such "miracles" are all
produced by the same human power that is inherent in every man, if he
only knew how to develop it.

About the time of the Reformation, the study of alchemy and magic had
become so prevalent among the clergy as to produce great scandal.
Cardinal Wolsey was openly accused before the court and the
privy-council of confederacy with a man named Wood, a sorcerer, who said
that "*My Lord Cardinale had suche a rynge that whatsomevere he askyd of
the Kynges grace that he hadd yt*"; adding that "*Master Cromwell, when
he* . . . *was servaunt in my lord cardynales housse* . . . *rede many
bokes and specyally the boke of Salamon .* . *. and studied mettells and
what vertues they had after the canon of Salamon.*" This case, with
several others equally curious, is to be found among the Cromwell papers
in the Record Office of the Rolls House.

A priest named William Stapleton was arrested as a conjurer, during the
reign of Henry **VIII**., and an account of his adventures is still
preserved in the Rolls House records. The Sicilian priest whom Benvenuto
Cellini calls a necromancer, became famous through his successful
conjurations, and was never molested. The remarkable adventure of
Cellini with him in the Colosseum, where the priest conjured up a whole
host of devils, is well known to the reading public. The subsequent
meeting of Cellini with his mistress, as predicted and brought about by
the conjurer, at the precise time fixed by him, is to be considered, as
a matter of course, a "curious coincidence." In the latter part of the
sixteenth century there was hardly a parish to be found in which the
priests did not study magic and alchemy. The practice of exorcism to
cast out devils "in imitation of Christ," who by the way never used
exorcism at all, led the clergy to devote themselves openly to "sacred"
magic in contradistinction to black art, of which latter crime were
accused all those who were neither priests nor monks.

###### <span id="page_58">p. 58</span>

The occult knowledge gleaned by the Roman Church from the once fat
fields of theurgy she sedulously guarded for her own use, and sent to
the stake only those practitioners who "poached" on her lands of the
*Scientia Scientiarum,* and those whose sins could not be concealed by
the friar's frock. The proof of it lies in the records of history. "In
the course only of fifteen years, between 1580 to 1595, and only in the
single province of Lorraine, the President Remigius burned 900 witches,"
says Thomas Wright, in his *Sorcery and Magic.* It was during these
days, prolific in ecclesiastical murder and unrivalled for cruelty and
ferocity, that Jean Bodin wrote.

While the orthodox clergy called forth whole legions of "demons" through
magical incantations, unmolested by the authorities, provided they held
fast to the established dogmas and taught no heresy, on the other hand,
acts of unparalleled atrocity were perpetrated on poor, unfortunate
fools. Gabriel Malagrida, an old man of eighty, was burnt by these
evangelical Jack Ketches in 1761. In the Amsterdam library there is a
copy of the report of his famous trial, translated from the Lisbon
edition. He was accused of sorcery and illicit intercourse with the
Devil, who had "disclosed to him *futurity.*" (?) The prophecy imparted
by the Arch-Enemy to the poor visionary Jesuit is reported in the
following terms: "The culprit hath confessed that the demon, under the
form of the blessed Virgin, having commanded him to write the life of
Antichrist (?), told him that he, Malagrida, was a second John, but more
clear than John the Evangelist; that there were to be three Antichrists,
and that the last should be born at Milan, of a monk and a nun, in the
year 1920; that he would marry Proserpine, one of the infernal furies,"
etc.

The prophecy is to be verified forty-three years hence. Even were all
the children born of monks and nuns really to become antichrists if
allowed to grow up to maturity, the fact would seem far less deplorable
than the discoveries made in so many convents when the foundations have
been removed for some reason. If the assertion of Luther is to be
disbelieved on account of his hatred for popery, then we may name
discoveries of the same character made quite recently in Austrian and
Russian Poland. Luther speaks of a fish-pond at Rome, situated near a
convent of nuns, which, having been cleared out by order of Pope
Gregory, disclosed, at the bottom, over six thousand infant skulls; and
of a nunnery at Neinburg, in Austria, whose foundations, when searched,
disclosed the same relics of celibacy and chastity!

"*Ecclesia non novit Sanguinem*!" meekly repeated the scarlet-robed
cardinals. And to avoid the spilling of blood which horrified them, they
instituted the Holy Inquisition. If, as the occultists maintain, and
science half confirms, our most trifling acts and thoughts are indelibly
impressed

###### <span id="page_59">p. 59</span>

upon the eternal mirror of the astral ether, there must be somewhere, in
the boundless realm of the unseen universe, the imprint of a curious
picture. It is that of a gorgeous standard waving in the heavenly breeze
at the foot of the great "white throne" of the Almighty. On its crimson
damask face a cross, symbol of "the Son of God who died for mankind,"
with an *olive* branch on one side, and a sword, stained to the hilt
with human gore, on the other. A legend selected from the *Psalms*
emblazoned in golden letters, reading thus: "*Exurge, Domine, et judica
causam meam.*" For such appears the standard of the Inquisition, on a
photograph in our possession, from an original procured at the Escurial
of Madrid.

Under this Christian standard, in the brief space of fourteen years,
Tomas de Torquemada, the confessor of Queen Isabella, burned over ten
thousand persons, and sentenced to the torture eighty thousand more.
Orobio, the well-known writer, who was detained so long in prison, and
who hardly escaped the flames of the Inquisition, immortalized this
institution in his works when once at liberty in Holland. He found no
better argument against the Holy Church than to embrace the Judaic faith
and submit even to circumcision. "In the cathedral of Saragossa," says a
writer on the Inquisition, "is the tomb of a famous inquisitor. Six
pillars surround the tomb; *to each is chained a Moor,* as preparatory
to being burned." On this St. Foix ingenuously observes: "If ever the
Jack Ketch of any country should be rich enough to have a splendid tomb,
this might serve as an excellent model!" To make it complete, however,
the builders of the tomb ought not to have omitted a bas-relief of the
famous horse which was burnt for sorcery and witchcraft. Granger tells
the story, describing it as having occurred in his time. The poor animal
"had been taught to tell the spots upon cards, and the hour of the day
by the watch. Horse and owner were both indicted by the sacred office
for dealing with the Devil, and both were burned, with a great ceremony
of *auto-da-fe,* at Lisbon, in 1601, as wizards!"

This immortal institution of Christianity did not remain without its
Dante to sing its praise. "Macedo, a Portuguese Jesuit," says the author
of *Demonologia,* "has discovered the origin of the Inquisition, in the
terrestrial Paradise, and presumes to allege that God was the first who
began the functions of an inquisitor over Cain and the workmen of
Babel!"

Nowhere, during the middle ages, were the arts of magic and sorcery more
practiced by the clergy than in Spain and Portugal. The Moors were
profoundly versed in the occult sciences, and at Toledo, Seville, and
Salamanca, were, once upon a time, the great schools of magic. The
kabalists of the latter town were skilled in all the abstruse sciences;
they

###### <span id="page_60">p. 60</span>

knew the virtues of precious stones and other minerals, and had
extracted from alchemy its most profound secrets.

The authentic documents pertaining to the great trial of the Marechale
d'Ancre, during the regency of Marie de Medicis, disclose that the
unfortunate woman perished through the fault of the priests with whom,
like a true Italian, she surrounded herself. She was accused by the
people of Paris of sorcery, because it had been asserted that she had
used, after the ceremony of exorcism, newly-killed white cocks.
Believing herself constantly bewitched, and being in very delicate
health, the Marechale had the ceremony of exorcism publicly applied to
herself in the Church of the Augustins; as to the birds, she used them
as an application to the forehead on account of dreadful pains in the
head, and had been advised to do so by Montalto, the Jew physician of
the queen, and the Italian priests.

In the sixteenth century, the Cure de Barjota, of the diocese of
Callahora, Spain, became the world's wonder for his magical powers. His
most extraordinary feat consisted, it was said, in transporting himself
to any distant country, witnessing political and other events, and then
returning home to predict them in his own country. He had a familiar
demon, who served him faithfully for long years, says the *Chronicle,*
but the cure turned ungrateful and cheated him. Having been apprised by
his demon of a conspiracy against the Pope's life, in consequence of an
intrigue of the latter with a fair lady, the cure transported himself to
Rome (in his double, of course) and thus saved his Holiness' life. After
which he repented, confessed his sins to the gallant Pope, and *got
absolution.* "On his return he was delivered, as a matter of form, into
the custody of the inquisitors of Logrono, but was acquitted and
restored to his liberty very soon."

Friar Pietro, a Dominican monk of the fourteenth century--the magician
who presented the famous Dr. Eugenio Torralva, a physician attached to
the house of the admiral of Castile, with a *demon* named Zequiel--won
his fame through the subsequent trial of Torralva. The procedure and
circumstances attendant upon the extraordinary trial are described in
the original papers preserved in the Archives of the Inquisition. The
Cardinal of Volterra, and the Cardinal of Santa Cruz, both saw and
communicated with Zequiel, who proved, during the whole of Torralva's
life, to be a pure, kind, elemental spirit, doing many beneficent
actions, and remaining faithful to the physician to the last hour of his
life. Even the Inquisition acquitted Torralva, on that account; and,
although an immortality of fame was insured to him by the satire of
Cervantes, neither Torralva nor the monk Pietro are fictitious heroes,
but historical personages, recorded in ecclesiastical documents of Rome
and Cuenca,

in which town the trial of the physician took place, January the 29th,
1530.

The book of Dr. W. G. Soldan, of Stuttgart, has become as famous in
Germany, as Bodin's book on *Demonomania* in France. It is the most
complete German treatise on witchcraft of the sixteenth century. One
interested to learn the secret machinery underlying these thousands of
legal murders, perpetrated by a clergy who pretended to believe in the
Devil, and succeeded in making others believe in him, will find it
divulged in the above-mentioned work. <span
id="fr_86"></span>[\*](#fn_86) The true origin of the daily accusations
and death-sentences for sorcery are cleverly traced to personal and
political enmities, and, above all, to the hatred of the Catholics
toward the Protestants. The crafty work of the Jesuits is seen at every
page of the bloody tragedies; and it is in Bamberg and Wurzburg, where
these worthy sons of Loyola were most powerful at that time, that the
cases of witchcraft were most numerous. On the next page we give a
curious list of some victims, many of whom were children between the
ages of seven and eight years, and Protestants. "Of the multitudes of
persons who perished at the stake in Germany during the first half of
the seventeenth century for sorcery, the crime of many was their
attachment to the religion of Luther," says T. Wright, " . . . and the
petty princes were not unwilling to seize upon any pretense to fill
their coffers . . . the persons most persecuted being those whose
property was a matter of consideration. . . . At Bamberg, as well as at
Wurzburg, the bishop was a sovereign prince in his dominions. The
Prince-Bishop, John George **II**., who ruled Bamberg . . . after
several unsuccessful attempts to root out Lutheranism, distinguished his
reign by a series of sanguinary witch-trials, which disgrace the annals
of that city. . . . We may form some notion of the proceedings of his
worthy agent, <span id="fr_87"></span>[\*\*](#fn_87) from the statement
of the most authentic historians, that between 1625 and 1630, not less
than 900 trials took place in the two courts of Bamberg and Zeil; and a
pamphlet published at Bamberg by authority, in 1659, states the number
of persons whom Bishop John George had caused to be burned for sorcery,
to have been 600." <span id="fr_88"></span>[\*\*\*](#fn_88)

Regretting that space should prevent our giving one of the most curious
lists in the world of burned witches, we will nevertheless make a few
extracts from the original record as printed in Hauber's *Bibliotheca* 

###### <span id="page_62">p. 62</span>

*Magica.* One glance at this horrible catalogue of murders in Christ's
name, is sufficient to discover that out of 162 persons burned, more
than one-half of them are designated as *strangers* (*i.e.,*
Protestants) in this hospitable town; and of the other half we find
*thirty-four children,* the oldest of whom was fourteen, the youngest
*an infant* child of Dr. Schutz. To make the catalogue shorter we will

In nineteen months, 162 persons.

"There were," says Wright, "little girls of from seven to ten years of
age among the witches, and *seven and twenty* of them were convicted and
burnt," at some of the other *brande,* or burnings. "The numbers brought
to trial in these terrible proceedings were so great, and they were
treated with so little consideration, that it was usual not even to take
the trouble of setting down their names, but they were cited as the
accused No. 1, No. 2, No. 3, and so on. <span
id="fr_90"></span>[\*](#fn_90) The Jesuits took their confessions in
private."

What room is there in a theology which exacts such holocausts as these
to appease the bloody appetites of its priests for the following gentle
words:

"Suffer the little children to come unto me, and forbid them not; for of
such is the kingdom of Heaven." "Even so it is not the will of your
Father . . . that one of these little ones should perish." "But whoso
shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me, it *were
better for him that a millstone were hanged* about his neck and that he
were drowned in the depths of the sea."

We sincerely hope that the above words have proved no vain threat to
these child-burners.

Did this butchery in the name of their Moloch-god prevent these
treasure-hunters from resorting to the black art themselves? Not in the
least; for in no class were such consulters of "familiar" spirits more
numerous than among the clergy during the fifteenth, sixteenth, and
seventeenth centuries. True, there were some Catholic priests among the
victims, but though these were generally accused of having "been

###### <span id="page_66">p. 66</span>

led into practices too dreadful to be described," it was not so. In the
twenty-nine burnings above catalogued we find the names of *twelve
vicars, four* canons, and two doctors of divinity *burnt alive.* But we
have only to turn to such works as were published at the time to assure
ourselves that each popish priest executed was accused of "damnable
heresy," *i.e.*, a tendency to reformation--a crime more heinous far
than sorcery.

We refer those who would learn how the Catholic clergy united duty with
pleasure in the matter of exorcisms, revenge, and treasure-hunting, to
volume **II**., chapter i., of W. Howitt's *History of the
Supernatural.* "In the book called *Pneumatologia Occulta et Vera,* all
the forms of adjuration and conjuration were laid down," says this
veteran writer. He then proceeds to give a long description of the
favorite *modus operandi.* The *Dogme et Rituel de la Haute Magie* of
the late Eliphas Levi, treated with so much abuse and contempt by des
Mousseaux, tells nothing of the weird ceremonies and practices but what
was practiced legally and with the tacit if not open consent of the
Church, by the priests of the middle ages. The exorcist-priest entered a
circle at midnight; he was clad in a new surplice, and had a consecrated
band hanging from the neck, covered with sacred characters. He wore on
the head a tall pointed cap, on the front of which was written in Hebrew
the holy word, Tetragrammaton--the ineffable name. It was written with a
new pen dipped in the blood of a white dove. What the exorcists most
yearned after, was to release miserable spirits *which haunt spots where
hidden treasures lie.* The exorcist sprinkles the circle with the blood
of a black lamb and a white pigeon. The priest had to adjure the evil
spirits of hell--Acheront, Magoth, Asmodei, Beelzebub, Belial, and all
the damned souls, in the mighty names of Jehovah, Adonay, Elohah, and
Sabaioth, which latter was the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, who
dwelt in the Urim and Thummim. When the damned souls flung in the face
of the exorcist that he was a sinner, and could not get the treasure
from them, the priest-sorcerer had to reply that "all his sins were
washed out in the blood of Christ, <span id="fr_91"></span>[\*](#fn_91)
and he bid them depart as cursed ghosts and damned flies." When the
exorcist dislodged them at last, the poor soul was "comforted in the
name of the Saviour, and *consigned to the care of good angels,*" who
were less powerful, we must think, than the exorcising Catholic
worthies, "and the rescued treasure, of course, was secured for the
Church."

"Certain days," adds Howitt, "are laid down in the calendar of the

###### <span id="page_67">p. 67</span>

Church as most favorable for the practice of exorcism; and, if the
devils are difficult to drive, a fume of sulphur, assafoetida, bear's
gall, and rue is recommended, which, it was presumed, would outstench
even devils."

This is the Church, and this the priesthood, which, in the nineteenth
century, pays 5,000 priests to teach the people of the United States the
infidelity of science and the infallibility of the Bishop of Rome!

We have already noticed the confession of an eminent prelate that the
elimination of Satan from theology would be fatal to the perpetuity of
the Church. But this is only partially true. The Prince of Sin would be
gone, but sin itself would survive. If the Devil were annihilated, the
*Articles of Faith* and the *Bible* would remain. In short there would
still be a pretended divine revelation, and the necessity for
self-assumed inspired interpreters. We must, therefore, consider the
authenticity of the *Bible* itself. We must study its pages, and see if
they, indeed, contain the commands of the Deity, or but a compendium of
ancient traditions and hoary myths. We must try to interpret them for
ourselves--if possible. As to its pretended interpreters, the only
possible assimilation we can find for them in the *Bible* is to compare
them with the man described by the wise King Solomon in his *Proverbs,*
with the perpetrator of these "six things . . . yea *seven* . . . which
doth the Lord hate," and which are an abomination unto Him, to wit: "A
*proud* look, a *lying* tongue, and hands that shed *innocent blood;* an
heart *that deviseth wicked imaginations,* feet that be swift in running
to mischief; a *false witness* that speaketh lies, and *he that soweth
discord among brethren*" (*Proverbs* vi. 16, 17, 18, 19).

Of which of these accusations are the long line of men who have left the
imprint of their feet in the Vatican guiltless?

"When the demons," says Augustine, "*insinuate* themselves in the
creatures, they begin by conforming themselves *to the will of every
one.* . . . In order to attract men, they begin by seducing them, by
simulating obedience. . . . *How could one know, had he not been taught
by the demons themselves,* what they like or what they hate; *the name
which attracts, or that which forces them into obedience;* all this art,
in short, of *magic,* the whole science of the magicians?" <span
id="fr_92"></span>[\*](#fn_92)

To this impressive dissertation of the "saint," we will add that no
magician has ever denied that he had learned the *art* from "spirits,"
whether, being a medium, they acted independently on him, or he had been
initiated into the science of "evocation" by his fathers who knew it
before himself. But who was it then that taught the exorcist? The priest

###### <span id="page_68">p. 68</span>

who clothes himself with an authority not only over the magician, but
even over all these "spirits," whom he calls demons and *devils* as soon
as he finds them obeying any one but himself? He must have learned
somewhere from some one that power which he pretends to possess. For, ".
. . *how could one know had he not been taught by the demons themselves*
. . . *the name which attracts, or that which forces them into
obedience?*" asks Augustine.

Useless to remark that we know the answer beforehand: "Revelation . . .
*divine* gift . . . the Son of God; nay, God Himself, through His direct
Spirit, who descended on the apostles as the Pentecostal fire," and who
is now alleged to overshadow every priest who sees fit to exorcise for
either glory or a gift. Are we then to believe that the recent scandal
of public exorcism, performed about the 14th of October, 1876, by the
senior priest of the Church of the Holy Spirit, at Barcelona, Spain, was
also done under the direct superintendence of the Holy Ghost? <span
id="fr_93"></span>[\*](#fn_93)

<span id="page_69">p. 69</span>

It will be urged that the "bishop was not cognizant of this freak of the
clergy"; but even if he were, how could he have protested against a rite
considered since the days of the apostles, one of the most holy
prerogatives of the Church of Rome? So late as in 1852, only twenty-five
years ago, these rites received a public and solemn sanction from the
Vatican, and a new *Ritual of Exorcism* was published in Rome, Paris,
and other Catholic capitals. Des Mousseaux, writing under the immediate
patronage of Father Ventura, the General of the Theatines of Rome, even
favors us with lengthy extracts from this famous ritual, and explains
the reason *why* it was enforced again. It was in consequence of the
revival of Magic under the name of Modern Spiritualism. The bull of Pope
Innocent **VIII**. is exhumed, and translated for the benefit of des
Mousseaux's readers. "We have heard," exclaims the Sovereign Pontiff,
"that a great number of persons of both sexes have feared not to enter
into relations with the spirits of hell; and that, by their practice of
sorcery . . . they strike with sterility the conjugal bed, destroy the
germs of humanity in the bosom of the mother, and throw spells on them,
and set a barrier to the multiplication of animals . . . etc., etc.";
then follow curses and anathemas against the practice.

This belief of the Sovereign Pontiffs of an enlightened Christian
country is a direct inheritance by the most ignorant multitudes from the
southern Hindu rabble--the "heathen." The diabolical arts of certain
kangalins (witches) and jadugar (sorcerers) are firmly believed in by
these people. The following are among their most dreaded powers: to
inspire love and hatred at will; to send a devil to take possession of a
person and torture

###### <span id="page_70">p. 70</span>

him; to expel him; to cause sudden death or an incurable disease; to
either strike cattle with or protect them from epidemics; to compose
philtres that will either strike with sterility or provoke unbounded
passions in men and women, etc., etc. The sight alone of a man said to
be such a sorcerer excites in a Hindu profound terror.

And now we will quote in this connection the truthful remark of a writer
who passed years in India in the study of the origin of such
superstitions: "Vulgar magic in India, like a degenerated infiltration,
goes hand-in-hand with the most ennobling beliefs of the sectarians of
the *Pitris.* It was the *work of the lowest clergy,* and designed to
hold the populace in a perpetual state of fear. It is thus that in all
ages and under every latitude, side by side with philosophical
speculations of the highest character, one always finds *the religion of
the rabble.*" <span id="fr_94"></span>[\*](#fn_94) In India it was the
work of the *lowest clergy;* in Rome, that of the *highest Pontiffs.*
But then, have they not as authority their greatest saint, Augustine,
who declares that "whoever believes not in the evil spirits, refuses to
believe in Holy Writ?" <span id="fr_95"></span>[\*\*](#fn_95)

Therefore, in the second half of the nineteenth century, we find the
counsel for the Sacred Congregation of Rites (exorcism of demons
included), Father Ventura de Raulica, writing thus, in a letter
published by des Mousseaux, in 1865:

"We are in full magic! and under false names; the Spirit of lies and
impudicity goes on perpetrating his horrible deprecations. . . . The
most grievous feature in this is that among the most serious persons
they do not attach the importance to the strange phenomena which they
deserve, these manifestations that we witness, and which become with
every day more weird, striking, as well as most fatal.

"I cannot sufficiently admire and praise, from this standpoint, the zeal
and courage displayed by you in your work. The facts which you have
collected are calculated to throw light and conviction into the most
skeptical minds; and after reading this remarkable work, written with so
much learnedness and consciousness, blindness is no longer possible.

"If anything could surprise us, it would be the indifference with which
these phenomena have been treated by *false* Science, endeavoring as she
has, to turn into ridicule so grave a subject; the childish simplicity
exhibited by her in the desire to explain the facts by absurd and
contradictory hypotheses. . . .  <span
id="fr_96"></span>[\*\*\*](#fn_96)

\[Signed\] "*The Father Ventura de Raulica,* etc., etc."

Thus encouraged by the greatest authorities of the Church of Rome,
ancient and modern, the Chevalier argues the necessity and the efficacy
of exorcism by the priests. He tries to demonstrate--*on faith,* as
usual --

###### <span id="page_71">p. 71</span>

that the power of the spirits of hell is closely related to certain
rites, words, and formal signs. "In the diabolical Catholicism," he
says, "as well as in the *divine* Catholicism, potential grace is
*bound* (*liee*) to certain signs." While the power of the Catholic
priest proceeds from God, that of the Pagan priest proceeds from the
Devil. The Devil, he adds, "is forced to submission" before the holy
minister of God--"*he dares not* LIE." <span
id="fr_97"></span>[\*](#fn_97)

We beg the reader to note well the underlined sentence, as we mean to
test its truth impartially. We are prepared to adduce proofs, undeniable
and undenied even by the Popish Church--forced, as she was, into the
confession--proofs of hundreds of cases in relation to the most solemn
of her dogmas, wherein the "spirits" lied from beginning to end. How
about certain holy relics authenticated by visions of the blessed
Virgin, and a host of saints? We have at hand a treatise by a pious
Catholic, Jilbert de Nogen, on the relics of saints. With honest despair
he acknowledges the "great number of false relics, as well as false
legends," and severely censures the inventors of these lying miracles.
"It was on the occasion *of one of our Saviour's teeth,*" writes the
author of *Demonologia,* "that de Nogen took up his pen on this subject,
by which the monks of St. Medard de Soissons pretended to work miracles;
a pretension which he asserted to be as chimerical as that of several
persons who believed they possessed the navel, and other parts less
comely, of the body of Christ." <span id="fr_98"></span>[\*\*](#fn_98)

"A monk of St. Antony," says Stephens, <span
id="fr_99"></span>[\*\*\*](#fn_99) "having been at Jerusalem, saw there
several relics, among which was a bit of *the finger of the Holy Ghost,*
as sound and entire as it had ever been; the snout of the seraph that
appeared to St. Francis; one of the nails of a cherub; one of the ribs
of the *Verbum caro factum* (the Word made flesh); some rays of the star
that appeared to the three kings of the East; a phial of St. Michael's
sweat, that exuded when he was fighting against the Devil, etc. 'All
which things,' observes the monkish treasurer of relics, 'I have brought
with me home very devoutly.' "

And if the foregoing is set aside as the invention of a Protestant
enemy, may we not be allowed to refer the reader to the History of
England and authentic documents which state the existence of a relic not
less extraordinary than the best of the others? Henry **III**. received
from the Grand Master of the Templars a phial containing a small portion
of the sacred blood of Christ which he had shed upon the cross. It was
attested to be genuine by the seals of the Patriarch of Jerusalem, and
others. The

###### <span id="page_72">p. 72</span>

procession bearing the sacred phial from St. Paul's to Westminster Abbey
is described by the historian: "Two monks received the phial, and
deposited it in the Abbey . . . which made all England shine with glory,
dedicating it to God and St. Edward."

The story of the Prince Radzivil is well known. It was the undeniable
deception of the monks and nuns surrounding him and his own confessor
which made the Polish nobleman become a Lutheran. He felt at first so
indignant at the "heresy" of the Reformation spreading in Lithuania,
that he travelled all the way to Rome to pay his homage of sympathy and
veneration to the Pope. The latter presented him with a precious box of
relics. On his return home, his confessor saw the Virgin, who descended
from her glorious abode for the sole purpose of blessing these relics
and authenticating them. The superior of the neighboring convent and the
mother-abbess of a nunnery both saw the same vision, with a
reenforcement of several saints and martyrs; they prophesied and "felt
the Holy Ghost" ascending from the box of relics and overshadowing the
prince. A demoniac provided for the purpose by the clergy was exorcised
in full ceremony, and upon being touched by the box immediately
recovered, and rendered thanks on the spot to the Pope and the Holy
Ghost. After the ceremony was over the guardian of the treasury in which
the relics were kept, threw himself at the feet of the prince, and
confessed that on their way back from Rome he had lost the box of
relics. Dreading the wrath of his master, he had procured a similar box,
"which he had filled with the small bones of dogs and cats"; but seeing
how the prince was deceived, he preferred confessing his guilt to such
blasphemous tricks. The prince said nothing, but continued for some time
testing--not the relics, but his confessor and the vision-seers. Their
mock raptures made him discover so thoroughly the gross impositions of
the monks and nuns that he joined the Reformed Church.

This is history. Bayle shows that when the Roman Church is no longer
able to deny that there have been false relics, she resorts to
sophistry, and replies that if false relics have wrought miracles it is
"because of the good intentions of the believers, who thus obtained from
God a reward of their good faith!" The same Bayle shows, by numerous
instances, that whenever it was proved that several bodies of the same
saint, or three heads of him, or three arms (as in the case of
Augustine) were said to exist in different places, and that they could
not well be all authentic, the cool and invariable answer of the Church
was that they were all genuine; for "God had multiplied and miraculously
reproduced them for the greater glory of His Holy Church!" In other
words they would have the faithful believe that the body of a deceased
saint may, through divine miracle, acquire the physiological
peculiarities of a crawfish!

###### <span id="page_73">p. 73</span>

We fancy that it would be hard to demonstrate to satisfaction that the
visions of Catholic saints, are, in any one particular instance, better
or more trustworthy than the average visions and prophecies of our
modern "mediums." The visions of Andrew Jackson Davis--however our
critics may sneer at them--are by long odds more philosophical and more
compatible with modern science than the Augustinian speculations.
Whenever the visions of Swedenborg, the greatest among the modern seers,
run astray from philosophy and scientific truth, it is when they most
run parallel with theology. Nor are these visions any more useless to
either science or humanity than those of the great orthodox saints. In
the life of St. Bernard it is narrated that as he was once in church,
upon a Christmas eve, he prayed that the very hour in which Christ was
born might be revealed to him; and when the "true and correct hour came,
he saw the divine babe appear in his manger." What a pity that the
divine babe did not embrace so favorable an opportunity to fix the
correct day and year of his death, and thereby reconcile the
controversies of his putative historians. The Tischendorfs, Lardners,
and Colensos, as well as many a Catholic divine, who have vainly
squeezed the marrow out of historical records and their own brains, in
the useless search, would at least have had something for which to thank
the saint.

As it is, we are hopelessly left to infer that most of the beatific and
divine visions of the *Golden Legend,* and those to be found in the more
complete biographies of the most important "saints," as well as most of
the visions of our own persecuted seers and seeresses, were produced by
ignorant and undeveloped "spirits" passionately fond of personating
great historical characters. We are quite ready to agree with the
Chevalier des Mousseaux, and other unrelenting persecutors of magic and
spiritualism in the name of the Church, that modern spirits are often
"lying spirits"; that they are ever on hand to humor the respective
hobbies of the persons who communicate with them at "circles"; that they
*deceive* them and, therefore, are not *always* good "spirits."

But, having conceded so much, we will now ask of any impartial person:
is it possible to believe at the same time that the *power* given to the
exorcist-priest, that supreme and *divine* power of which he boasts, has
been given to him by God for the purpose of deceiving people? That the
prayer pronounced by him *in* *the name of Christ,* and which, forcing
the *demon* into submission, makes him reveal himself, is calculated at
the same time to make the devil confess *not the truth,* but that only
which it is the *interest of the church to which the exorcist belongs,*
should *pass for truth?* And this is what invariably happens. Compare,
for instance, the responses given by the demon to Luther, with those
obtained from the devils by St. Dominick. The one argues against the

###### <span id="page_74">p. 74</span>

private mass, and upbraids Luther with placing the Virgin Mary and
saints before Christ, and thus dishonoring the Son of God; <span
id="fr_100"></span>[\*](#fn_100) while the demons exorcised by St.
Dominick, upon seeing the Virgin whom the holy father had also evoked to
help him, roar out: "Oh! our enemy! oh! our damner! . . . why didst thou
descend from heaven to torment us? Why art thou so powerful an
intercessor for sinners! Oh! *thou most certain and secure way to
heaven* . . . thou commandest us *and we are forced to confess* that
nobody is damned who only perseveres in thy holy worship, etc.,
etc." <span id="fr_101"></span>[\*\*](#fn_101) Luther's "Saint Satan"
assures him that while believing in the transubstantiation of Christ's
body and blood he had been worshipping merely bread and wine; and the
*devils* of all the Catholic saints promise *eternal damnation* to
whomsoever disbelieves or even so much as doubts the dogma!

Before leaving the subject, let us give one or two more instances from
the *Chronicles of the Lives of the Saints,* selected from such
narratives as are fully accepted by the Church. We might fill volumes
with proofs of undeniable confederacy between the exorcisers and the
demons. Their very nature betrays them. Instead of being independent,
crafty entities bent on the destruction of men's souls and spirits, the
majority of them are simply the elementals of the kabalists; creatures
with no intellect of their own, but faithful mirrors of the WILL which
evokes, controls, and guides them. We will not waste our time in drawing
the reader's attention to doubtful or obscure thaumaturgists and
exorcisers, but take as our standard one of the greatest saints of
Catholicism, and select a bouquet from that same prolific conservatory
of pious lies, *The Golden Legend,* of James de Voragine. <span
id="fr_102"></span>[\*\*\*](#fn_102)

St. Dominick, the founder of the famous order of that name, is one of
the mightiest saints on the calendar. His order was the first that
received a solemn confirmation from the Pope, <span
id="fr_103"></span>[\*\*\*\*](#fn_103) and he is well known in history
as the associate and counsellor of the infamous Simon de Montfort, the
papal general, whom he helped to butcher the unfortunate Albigenses in
and near Toulouse. The story goes that this saint and the Church after
him, claim that he received from the Virgin, *in propria persona,* a
rosary, whose virtues produced such stupendous miracles that they throw
entirely into the shade those of the apostles, and even of Jesus
himself. A man, says the biographer, an abandoned sinner, was bold
enough to doubt the

###### <span id="page_75">p. 75</span>

virtue of the Dominican rosary; and for this unparalleled blasphemy was
punished on the spot by having 15,000 devils take possession of him.
Seeing the great suffering of the tortured demoniac, St. Dominick forgot
the insult and called the devils to account.

Following is the colloquy between the "blessed exorcist" and the demons:

Question.--How did you take possession of this man, and how many are
you?

Answer of the Devils. --We came into him for having spoken
disrespectfully of the rosary. We are 15,000.

Question.--Why did so many as 15,000 enter him?

Answer.--Because there are fifteen decades in the rosary which he
derided, etc.

Dominick.--Is not all true I have said of the virtues of the rosary?

Devils.--Yes! Yes! (*they emit flames through the nostrils of the
demoniac*). Know all ye Christians that Dominick never said one word
concerning the rosary that is not most true; and know ye further, that
if you do not believe him, great calamities will befall you.

Dominick.--Who is the man in the world the Devil hates the most?

Devils.--(*In chorus*.) Thou art the very man (*here follow verbose
compliments*).

Dominick.--Of which state of Christians are there the most damned?

Devils.--In hell we have merchants, pawnbrokers, fraudulent bankers,
grocers, Jews, apothecaries, etc., etc.

Dominick.--Are there any priests or monks in hell?

Devils.--There are a great number of priests, but *no monks,* with the
exception of such as have transgressed the rule of their order.

Dominick.--Have you any Dominicans?

Devils.--Alas! alas! we have not one yet, but we expect a great number
of them after their devotion is a little cooled.

We do not pretend to give the questions and answers literally, for they
occupy twenty-three pages; but the substance is here, as may be seen by
any one who cares to read the *Golden Legend.* The full description of
the hideous bellowings of the demons, their enforced glorification of
the saint, and so on, is too long for this chapter. Suffice it to say
that as we read the numerous questions offered by Dominick and the
answers of the demons, we become fully convinced that they corroborate
in every detail the unwarranted assertions and support the interests of
the Church. The narrative is suggestive. The legend graphically
describes the battle of the exorcist with the legion from the bottomless
pit. The sulphurous flames which burst forth from the nose, mouth, eyes,
and ears, of the demoniac; the sudden appearance of over a hun-

###### <span id="page_76">p. 76</span>

dred angels, clad in golden armor; and, finally, the descent of the
blessed Virgin herself, in person, bearing a golden rod, with which she
administers a sound thrashing to the demoniac, to force the devils to
confess that of herself which we scarcely need repeat. The whole
catalogue of theological truths uttered by Dominick's devils were
embodied in so many articles of faith by his Holiness, the present Pope,
in 1870, at the last Œcumenical Council.

From the foregoing it is easy to see that the only substantial
difference between infidel "mediums" and orthodox saints lies in the
relative usefulness of the *demons,* if demons we must call them. While
the Devil faithfully supports the Christian exorcist in his *orthodox*
(?) views, the modern spook generally leaves his medium in the lurch.
For, by lying, he acts *against* his or her interests rather than
otherwise, and thereby too often casts foul suspicion on the genuineness
of the mediumship. Were modern "spirits" *devils,* they would evidently
display a little more discrimination and cunning than they do. They
would act as the *demons* of the saint which, compelled by the
ecclesiastical magician and by the power of "the name . . . which forces
them into submission," *lie in accordance with the direct interest* of
the exorcist and his church. The moral of the parallel we leave to the
sagacity of the reader.

"Observe well," exclaims des Mousseaux, "that there are *demons* which
sometimes will speak the truth." "The exorcist," he adds, quoting the
*Ritual,* "must command the demon to tell him whether he is detained in
the body of the demoniac through some magic art, or by *signs,* or any
objects which usually serve for this evil practice. In case the
exorcised person has swallowed the latter, he must vomit them back; and
if they are not in his body, the demon must indicate the proper place
where they are to be found; and having found them they must be
burned." <span id="fr_104"></span>[\*](#fn_104) Thus some "demons reveal
the existence of the bewitchment, tell who is its author, and indicate
the means to destroy the *malefice.* But beware to ever resort, in such
a case, to magicians, sorcerers, or mediums. You must call to help you
but the minister of your Church!" "The Church believes in magic, as you
well see," he adds, "since she expresses it so formally. And those who
*disbelieve in magic,* can they still hope to share the faith of their
own Church? And who can teach them better? To whom did Christ say: 'Go
ye therefore, and teach all nations . . . and lo, I am with you always,
even to the end of the world?' " <span
id="fr_105"></span>[\*\*](#fn_105)

Are we to believe that he said this but to those who wear these black

###### <span id="page_77">p. 77</span>

or scarlet liveries of Rome? Must we then credit the story that this
power was given by Christ to Simon Stylites, the saint who sanctified
himself by perching on a pillar (*stylos*) sixty feet high, for
thirty-six years of his life, without ever descending from it, in order
that, among other miracles stated in the *Golden Legend,* he might cure
a *dragon* of a sore eye? "Near Simon's pillar was the dwelling of a
dragon, so very venomous that the stench was spread for miles round his
cave." This ophidian-hermit met with an accident; he got a thorn in his
eye, and, becoming blind, crept to the saint's pillar, and pressed his
eye against it for three days, without touching any one. Then the
blessed saint, from his aerial seat, "*three feet in diameter,*" ordered
earth and water to be placed on the dragon's eye, out of which suddenly
emerged a thorn (or stake), a cubit in length; when the people saw the
"miracle" they glorified the Creator. As to the grateful dragon, he
arose and, "having adored God for two hours, returned to his cave" <span
id="fr_106"></span>[\*](#fn_106)--a half-converted ophidian, we must
suppose.

And what are we to think of that other narrative, to disbelieve in which
is "*to risk one's salvation*," as we were informed by a Pope's
missionary, of the Order of the Franciscans? When St. Francis preached a
sermon in the wilderness, the birds assembled from the four cardinal
points of the world. They warbled and applauded every sentence; they
sang a holy mass in chorus; finally they dispersed to carry the glad
tidings all over the universe. A grasshopper, profiting by the absence
of the Holy Virgin, who generally kept company with the saint, remained
perched on the head of the "blessed one" for a whole week. Attacked by a
ferocious wolf, the saint, who had no other weapon but the sign of the
cross which he made upon himself, instead of running away from his rabid
assailant, began arguing with the beast. Having imparted to him the
benefit to be derived from the holy religion, St. Francis never ceased
talking until the wolf became as meek as a lamb, and even shed tears of
repentance over his past sins. Finally, he "stretched his paws in the
hands of the saint, followed him like a dog through all the towns in
which he preached, and became half a Christian"! <span
id="fr_107"></span>[\*\*](#fn_107) Wonders of zoology! a horse turned
sorcerer, a wolf and a dragon turned Christians!

These two anecdotes, chosen at random from among hundreds, if rivalled
are not surpassed by the wildest romances of the Pagan thaumaturgists,
magicians, and spiritualists! And yet, when Pythagoras is said to have
subdued animals, even wild beasts, merely through a powerful

###### <span id="page_78">p. 78</span>

mesmeric influence, he is pronounced by one-half of the Catholics a
bare-faced impostor, and by the rest a sorcerer, who worked magic in
confederacy with the Devil. Neither the she-bear, nor the eagle, nor yet
the bull that Pythagoras is said to have persuaded to give up eating
beans, were alleged to have answered with human voices; while St.
Benedict's "black raven," whom he called "brother," argues with him, and
croaks his answers like a born casuist. When the saint offers him
one-half of a poisoned loaf, the raven grows indignant and reproaches
him in Latin as though he had just graduated at the Propaganda!

If it be objected that the *Golden Legend* is now but half supported by
the Church; and that it is known to have been compiled by the writer
from a collection of the lives of the saints, for the most part
unauthenticated, we can show that, at least in one instance, the
biography is no legendary compilation, but the history of one man, by
another one who was his contemporary. Jortin and Gibbon demonstrated
years ago, that the early fathers used to select narratives, wherewith
to ornament the lives of their apocryphal saints, from Ovid, Homer,
Livy, and even from the unwritten popular legends of Pagan nations. But
such is not the case in the above instances. St. Bernard lived in the
twelfth century, and St. Dominick was nearly contemporaneous with the
author of the *Golden Legend.* De Voragine died in 1298, and Dominick,
whose exorcisms and life he describes so minutely, instituted his order
in the first quarter of the thirteenth century. Moreover, de Voragine
was Vicar-General of the Dominicans himself, in the middle of the same
century, and therefore described the miracles wrought by his hero and
patron but a few years after they were alleged to have happened. He
wrote them in the same convent; and while narrating these wonders he had
probably fifty persons at hand who had been eye-witnesses to the saint's
mode of living. What must we think, in such a case, of a biographer who
seriously describes the following: One day, as the blessed saint was
occupied in his study, the Devil began pestering him, in the shape of a
flea. He frisked and jumped about the pages of his book until the
harassed saint, unwilling as he was to act unkindly, even toward a
devil, felt compelled to punish him by fixing the troublesome devil on
the very sentence on which he stopped, by clasping the book. At another
time the same devil appeared under the shape of a monkey. He grinned so
horribly that Dominick, in order to get rid of him, ordered the
devil-monkey to take the candle and hold it for him until he had done
reading. The poor imp did so, and held it until it was consumed to the
very end of the wick; and, notwithstanding his pitiful cries for mercy,
the saint compelled him to hold it till his fingers were burned to the
bones!

Enough! The approbation with which this book was received by the

###### <span id="page_79">p. 79</span>

Church, and the peculiar sanctity attributed to it, is sufficient to
show the estimation in which veracity was held by its patrons. We may
add, in conclusion, that the finest quintessence of Boccaccio's
*Decameron* appears prudery itself by comparison with the filthy realism
of the *Golden Legend*.

We cannot regard with too much astonishment the pretensions of the
Catholic Church in seeking to convert Hindus and Buddhists to
Christianity. While the "heathen" keeps to the faith of his fathers, he
has at least the one redeeming quality--that of not having apostatized
for the mere pleasure of exchanging one set of idols for another. There
may be for him some novelty in his embracing Protestantism; for in that
he gains the advantage, at least, of limiting his religious views to
their simplest expression. But when a Buddhist has been enticed into
exchanging his Shoe Dagoon for the Slipper of the Vatican, or the eight
hairs from the head of Gautama and Buddha's tooth, which work miracles,
for the locks of a Christian saint, and a tooth of Jesus, which work far
less clever miracles, he has no cause to boast of his choice. In his
address to the Literary Society of Java, Sir T. S. Raffles is said to
have narrated the following characteristic anecdote: "On visiting the
great temple on the hills of Nagasaki, the English commissioner was
received with marked regard and respect by the venerable patriarch of
the northern provinces, a man eighty years of age, who entertained him
most sumptuously. On showing him round the courts of the temple, one of
the English officers present heedlessly exclaimed, in surprise, 'Jesus
Christus!' The patriarch turning half round, with a placid smile, bowed
significantly, with the expression: 'We know your Jasus Christus! Well,
don't obtrude him upon us in our temples, and we remain friends.' And
so, with a hearty shake of the hands, these two opposites parted." <span
id="fr_108"></span>[\*](#fn_108)

There is scarcely a report sent by the missionaries from India, Thibet,
and China, but laments the diabolical "obscenity" of the heathen rites,
their lamentable impudicity; all of which "are so strongly suggestive of
devil-worship," as des Mousseaux tells us. We can scarcely be assured
that the morality of the Pagans would be in the least improved were they
allowed a free inquiry into the life of say the psalmist-king, the
author of those sweet *Psalms* which are so rapturously repeated by
Christians. The difference between David performing a phallic dance
before the holy ark--emblem of the female principle--and a Hindu
Vishnavite bearing the same emblem on his forehead, favors the former
only in the eyes of those who have studied neither the ancient faith nor
their own. When a religion which compelled David to cut off and deliver
two hundred foreskins of his enemies before he could become the king's

is accepted as a standard by Christians, they would do well not to cast
into the teeth of heathen the impudicities of their faiths. Remembering
the suggestive parable of Jesus, they ought to cast the beam out of
their own eye before plucking at the mote in their neighbor's. The
sexual element is as marked in Christianity as in any one of the
"heathen religions." Certainly, nowhere in the *Vedas* can be found the
coarseness and downright immodesty of language, that Hebraists now
discover throughout the Mosaic

Bible.

It would profit little were we to dwell much upon subjects which have
been disposed of in such a masterly way by an anonymous author whose
work electrified England and Germany last year; <span
id="fr_109"></span>[\*](#fn_109) while as regards the particular topic
under notice, we cannot do better than recommend the scholarly writings
of Dr. Inman. Albeit one-sided, and in many instances unjust to the
ancient heathen, Pagan, and Jewish religions, the *facts* treated in the
*Ancient and Pagan Christian Symbolism,* are unimpeachable. Neither can
we agree with some English critics who charge him with an intent to
destroy Christianity. If by *Christianity* is meant the external
religious forms of worship, then he certainly seeks to destroy it, for
in his eyes, as well as in those of every truly religious man, who has
studied ancient exoteric faiths, and their symbology, Christianity is
pure heathenism, and Catholicism, with its fetish-worshipping, is far
worse and more pernicious than Hinduism in its most idolatrous aspect.
But while denouncing the exoteric forms and unmasking the symbols, it is
not the religion of Christ that the author attacks, but the artificial
system of theology. We will allow him to illustrate the position in his
own language, and quote from his preface:

"When vampires were discovered by the acumen of any observer," he says,
"they were, we are told, ignominiously killed, by a stake being driven
through the body; but experience showed them to have such tenacity of
life that they rose, again and again, notwithstanding renewed
impalement, and were not ultimately laid to rest till wholly burned. In
like manner, the regenerated heathendom, which dominates over the
followers of Jesus of Nazareth, has risen again and again, after being
transfixed. Still cherished by the many, it is denounced by the few.
Amongst other accusers, I raise my voice against the Paganism which
exists so extensively in ecclesiastical Christianity, and will do my
utmost to expose the imposture. . . . In a vampire story told in
*Thalaba,* by Southey, the resuscitated being takes the form of a
dearly-beloved maiden, and the hero is obliged to kill her with his own
hand. He does so; but, whilst he strikes the form of the loved one, he
feels sure that he slays

###### <span id="page_81">p. 81</span>

only a demon. In like manner, when I endeavor to destroy the current
heathenism, which has assumed the garb of Christianity, *I do not attack
real religion*. <span id="fr_110"></span>[\*](#fn_110) Few would accuse
a workman of malignancy, who cleanses from filth the surface of a noble
statue. There may be some who are too nice to touch a nasty subject, yet
even they will rejoice when some one else removes the dirt. Such a
scavenger is wanted." <span id="fr_111"></span>[\*\*](#fn_111)

But is it merely Pagans and heathen that the Catholics persecute, and
about whom, like Augustine, they cry to the Deity, "Oh, my God! *so do I
wish Thy enemies to be slain*"? Oh, no! their aspirations are more
Mosaic and Cain-like than that. It is against their next of kin in
faith, against their schismatic brothers that they are now intriguing
within the walls which sheltered the murderous Borgias. The *larvae* of
the infanticidal, parricidal, and fratricidal Popes have proved
themselves fit counsellors for the Cains of Castelfidardo and Mentana.
It is now the turn of the Slavonian Christians, the Oriental
Schismatics--the Philistines of the Greek Church!

His Holiness the Pope, after exhausting, in a metaphor of
self-laudation, every point of assimilation between the great biblical
prophets and himself, has finally and truly compared himself with the
Patriarch Jacob "wrestling against his God." He now crowns the edifice
of Catholic piety by openly sympathizing with the Turks! The vicegerent
of God inaugurates his infallibility by encouraging, in a true Christian
spirit, the acts of that Moslem David, the modern Bashi-Bazuk; and it
seems as if nothing would more please his Holiness than to be presented
by the latter with several thousands of the Bulgarian or Servian
"foreskins." True to her policy to be all things to all men to promote
her own interests, the Romish Church is, at this writing (1876),
benevolently viewing the Bulgarian and Servian atrocities, and,
probably, manoeuvring with Turkey against Russia. Better Islam, and the
hitherto-hated Crescent over the sepulchre of the Christian god, than
the Greek Church established at Constantinople and Jerusalem as the
state religion. Like a decrepit and toothless ex-tyrant in exile, the
Vatican is eager for any alliance that promises, if not a restoration of
its own power, at least the weakening of its rival. The axe its
inquisitors once swung, it now toys

###### <span id="page_82">p. 82</span>

with in secret, feeling its edge, and waiting, and hoping against hope.
In her time, the Popish Church has lain with strange bedfellows, but
never before now sunk to the degradation of giving her moral support to
those who for over 1200 years spat in her face, called her adherents
"infidel dogs," repudiated her teachings, and denied godhood to her God!

The press of even Catholic France is fairly aroused at this indignity,
and openly accuses the Ultramontane portion of the Catholic Church and
the Vatican of siding, during the present Eastern struggle, with the
Mahometan against the Christian. "When the Minister of Foreign Affairs
in the French Legislature spoke some mild words in favor of the Greek
Christians, he was only applauded by the liberal Catholics, and received
coldly by the Ultramontane party," says the French correspondent of a
New York paper.

"So pronounced was this, that M. Lemoinne, the well-known editor of the
great liberal Catholic journal, the *Debats,* was moved to say that the
Roman Church felt more sympathy for the Moslem than the schismatic, just
as they preferred an infidel to the Protestant. 'There is at bottom,'
says this writer, 'a great affinity between the *Syllabus* and the
*Koran,* and between the two heads of the faithful. The two systems are
of the same nature, and are united on the common ground of a one and
unchangeable theory.' In Italy, in like manner, the King and Liberal
Catholics are in warm sympathy with the unfortunate Christians, while
the Pope and Ultramontane faction are believed to be inclining to the
Mahometans."

The civilized world may yet expect the apparition of the materialized
Virgin Mary within the walls of the Vatican. The so often-repeated
"miracle" of the Immaculate Visitor in the mediaeval ages has recently
been enacted at Lourdes, and why not once more, as a *coup de grace* to
all heretics, schismatics, and infidels? The miraculous wax taper is yet
seen at Arras, the chief city of Artois; and at every new calamity
threatening her beloved Church, the "Blessed Lady" appears personally,
and lights it with her own fair hands, in view of a whole "biologized"
congregation. This sort of "miracle," says E. Worsley, wrought by the
Roman Catholic Church, "being most certain, and never doubted of by
any." <span id="fr_112"></span>[\*](#fn_112) Neither has the private
correspondence with which the most "Gracious Lady" honors her friends
been doubted. There are two precious missives from her in the archives
of the Church. The first purports to be a letter in answer to one
addressed to her by Ignatius. She confirms all things learned by her
correspondent from "her friend" --

###### <span id="page_83">p. 83</span>

meaning the Apostle John. She bids him hold fast to his vows, and adds
as an inducement: "*I and John will come together and pay you a
visit*." <span id="fr_113"></span>[\*](#fn_113)

Nothing was known of this unblushing fraud till the letters were
published at Paris, in 1495. By a curious accident it appeared at a time
when threatening inquiries began to be made as to the genuineness of the
fourth Synoptic. Who could doubt, after such a confirmation from
headquarters! But the climax of effrontery was capped in 1534, when
another letter was received from the "Mediatrix," which sounds more like
the report of a lobby-agent to a brother-politician. It was written in
excellent Latin, and was found in the Cathedral of Messina, together
with the image to which it alludes. Its contents run as follows:

> "Mary Virgin, Mother of the Redeemer of the world, to the Bishop,
> Clergy, and the other faithful of Messina, sendeth health and
> benediction from *herself* and son: <span
> id="fr_114"></span>[\*\*](#fn_114)

> "Whereas ye have been mindful of establishing the worship of me; now
> this is to let you know that by so doing ye have found great favor in
> my sight. I have a long time reflected with pain upon your city, which
> is exposed to much danger from its contiguity to the fire of Etna, and
> I have often had words about it with my son, for he was vexed with you
> because of your guilty neglect of my worship, so that he would not
> care a pin about my intercession. Now, however, that you have come to
> your senses, and have happily begun to worship me, he has conferred
> upon me the right to become your everlasting protectress; but, at the
> same time, I warn you to mind what you are about, and give me no cause
> of repenting of my kindness to you. The prayers and festivals
> instituted in my honor please me tremendously (*vehementer*), and if

> "**M**ARY **V**IRGIN"

The reader should understand that this document is no anti-Catholic
forgery. The author from whom it is taken, <span
id="fr_115"></span>[\*\*\*](#fn_115) says that the authenticity of the
missive "is attested by the Bishop himself, his Vicar-General,

###### <span id="page_84">p. 84</span>

Secretary, and six Canons of the Cathedral Church of Messina, all of
whom have signed that attestation with their names, and confirmed it
upon oath.

"Both the epistle and image were found upon the high altar, where they
had been placed by angels from heaven."

A Church must have reached the last stages of degradation, when such
sacrilegious trickery as this could be resorted to by its clergy, and
accepted with or without question by the people.

No! far from the man who feels the workings of an immortal spirit within
him, be such a religion! There never was nor ever will be a truly
philosophical mind, whether of Pagan, heathen, Jew, or Christian, but
has followed the same path of thought. Gautama-Buddha is mirrored in the
precepts of Christ; Paul and Philo Judaeus are faithful echoes of Plato;
and Ammonius Saccas and Plotinus won their immortal fame by combining
the teachings of all these grand masters of true philosophy. "Prove all
things; hold fast that which is good," ought to be the motto of all
brothers on earth. Not so is it with the interpreters of the *Bible.*
The seed of the Reformation was sown on the day that the second chapter
of *The Catholic Epistle of James,* jostled the eleventh chapter of the
*Epistle to the Hebrews* in the same *New Testament.* One who believes
in Paul cannot believe in James, Peter, and John. The Paulists, to
remain Christians with their apostle, must withstand Peter "to the
face"; and if Peter "was to be blamed" and *was wrong,* then he was not
infallible. How then can his successor (?) boast of his infallibility?
Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and every
house divided against itself must fall. A plurality of masters has
proved as fatal in religions as in politics. What Paul preached, was
preached by every other mystic philosopher. "Stand *fast therefore in
the liberty* wherewith Christ hath made us free, and *be not entangled
again with the yoke of bondage!*" exclaims the honest
apostle-philosopher; and adds, as if prophetically inspired: "But if ye
bite and devour one another, take heed that ye be not consumed one of
another."

That the Neo-platonists were not always despised or accused of
demonolatry is evidenced in the adoption by the Roman Church of their
very rites and theurgy. The identical evocations and incantations of the
Pagan and Jewish Kabalist, are now repeated by the Christian exorcist,
and the theurgy of Iamblichus was adopted word for word. "Distinct as
were the Platonists and Pauline Christians of the earlier centuries,"
writes Professor A. Wilder, "many of the more distinguished teachers of
the new faith were deeply tinctured with the philosophical leaven.
Synesius, the Bishop of Cyrene, was the disciple of Hypatia. *St.
Anthony reiterated the theurgy of Iamblichus.* The *Logos,* or word of
the

Gospel

###### <span id="page_85">p. 85</span>

according to John, was a Gnostic personification. Clement of Alexandria,
Origen, and others of the fathers drank deeply from the fountains of
philosophy. The ascetic idea which carried away the Church was like that
which was practiced by Plotinus . . . all through the middle ages there
rose up men who accepted the interior doctrines which were promulgated
by the renowned teacher of the Academy." <span
id="fr_116"></span>[\*](#fn_116)

To substantiate our accusation that the Latin Church first despoiled the
kabalists and theurgists of their magical rites and ceremonies, before
hurling anathemas upon their devoted heads, we will now translate for
the reader fragments from the forms of *exorcism* employed by kabalists
and Christians. The identity in phraseology, may, perhaps, disclose one
of the reasons why the Romish Church has always desired to keep the
faithful in ignorance of the meaning of her Latin prayers and ritual.
Only those directly interested in the deception have had the opportunity
to compare the rituals of the Church and the magicians. The best Latin
scholars were, until a comparatively recent date, either churchmen, or
dependent upon the Church. Common people could not read Latin, and even
if they could, the reading of the books on magic was prohibited, under
the penalty of anathema and excommunication. The cunning device of the
confessional made it almost impossible to consult, even surreptitiously,
what the priests call a *grimoire* (a devil's scrawl), or *Ritual of
Magic.* To make assurance doubly sure, the Church began destroying or
concealing everything of the kind she could lay her hands upon.

The following are translated from the *Kabalistic Ritual,* and that
generally known as the *Roman Ritual.* The latter was promulgated in
1851 and 1852, under the sanction of Cardinal Engelbert, Archbishop of
Malines, and of the Archbishop of Paris. Speaking of it, the
demonologist des Mousseaux says: "It is the ritual of Paul V., revised
by the most learned of modern Popes, by the contemporary of Voltaire,
Benedict **XIV**." <span id="fr_117"></span>[\*\*](#fn_117)

It is unnecessary to try the patience of the reader any longer, although
we might multiply examples. It must not be forgotten that we have quoted
from the latest revision of the *Ritual,* that of 1851-2. If we were to
go back to the former one we would find a far more striking identity,
not merely of phraseology but of ceremonial form. For the purpose of
comparison we have not even availed ourselves of the ritual of
ceremonial magic of the *Christian* kabalists of the middle ages,
wherein the language modelled upon a belief in the divinity of Christ
is, with the exception of a stray expression here and there, identical
with the Catholic

###### <span id="page_87">p. 87</span>

Ritual. <span id="fr_121"></span>[\*](#fn_121) The latter, however,
makes one improvement, for the originality of which the Church should be
allowed all credit. Certainly nothing so fantastical could be found in a
ritual of magic. "Give place," apostrophizing the "Demon," it says,
"give place to Jesus Christ . . . thou *filthy, stinking, and ferocious
beast* . . . dost thou rebel? Listen and tremble, Satan; enemy of the
faith, enemy of the human race, introducer of death . . . root of all
evil, promoter of vice, soul of envy, origin of avarice, cause of
discord, prince of homicide, whom God curses; author of incest and
sacrilege, inventor of all obscenity, *professor* of the most detestable
actions, *and Grand Master of Heretics* (!!) (*Doctor Haereticorum*!)
What! . . . dost thou still stand? Dost dare to resist, and thou knowest
that Christ, our Lord, is coming? . . . Give place to Jesus Christ, give
place to the Holy Ghost, which, by His blessed Apostle Peter, has flung
thee down before the public, in the person of Simon the Magician" (*te
manifeste stravit in Simone mago*). <span

After such a shower of abuse, no devil having the slightest feeling of
self-respect could remain in such company; unless, indeed, he should
chance to be an Italian Liberal, or King Victor Emmanuel himself both of
whom, thanks to Pius **IX**., have become anathema-proof.

It really seems too bad to strip Rome of all her symbols at once; but
justice must be done to the despoiled hierophants. Long before the sign
of the Cross was adopted as a Christian symbol, it was employed as a
secret sign of recognition among neophytes and adepts. Says Levi: "The
sign of the Cross adopted by the Christians does not belong exclusively
to them. It is kabalistic, and represents the oppositions and quaternary
equilibrium of the elements. We see by the occult verse of the *Pater,*
to which we have called attention in another work, that there were
originally two ways of making it, or, at least, two very different
formulas to express its meaning--one reserved for priests and initiates;
the other given to neophytes and the profane. Thus, for example, the
*initiate,* carrying his hand to his forehead, said: *To thee;* then he
added, *belong;* and continued, while carrying his hand to the
breast--*the kingdom;* then, to the left shoulder--*justice*; to the
right shoulder--*and mercy.* Then he joined the two hands, adding:
*throughout the generating cycles: 'Tibi sunt Malchut, et Geburah et
Chassed per Æonas*'*--*a sign of the Cross, *absolutely* and
magnificently kabalistic, which the profanations of Gnosticism made the
militant and official Church completely *lose*." <span

###### <span id="page_88">p. 88</span>

How fantastical, therefore, is the assertion of Father Ventura, that,
while Augustine was a Manichean, a philosopher, ignorant of and refusing
to humble himself before the sublimity of the "grand Christian
revelation," he knew nothing, understood naught of God, man, or
universe; ". . . he remained poor, small, obscure, sterile, and wrote
nothing, did nothing really grand or useful." But, hardly had he become
a Christian ". . . when his reasoning powers and intellect, enlightened
at the *luminary of faith,* elevated him to the most sublime heights of
philosophy and theology." And his other proposition that Augustine's
genius, as a consequence, "developed itself in all its grandeur and
prodigious fecundity . . . his intellect radiated with that immense
splendor which, reflecting itself in his immortal writings, has never
ceased for one moment during fourteen centuries to illuminate the Church
and the world"! <span id="fr_124"></span>[\*](#fn_124)

Whatever Augustine was as a Manichean, we leave Father Ventura to
discover; but that his accession to Christianity established an
everlasting enmity between theology and science is beyond doubt. While
forced to confess that "the Gentiles had possibly something *divine* and
true in their doctrines," he, nevertheless, declared that for their
superstition, idolatry, and pride, they had "to be detested, and, unless
they improved, to be punished by divine judgment." This furnishes the
clew to the subsequent policy of the Christian Church, even to our day.
If the Gentiles did not choose to come into the Church, all that was
divine in their philosophy should go for naught, and the divine wrath of
God should be visited upon their heads. What effect this produced is
succinctly stated by Draper: "No one did more than this Father to bring
science and religion into antagonism; it was mainly he who diverted the
*Bible* from its true office--a guide to purity of life--and placed it
in the perilous position of being the arbiter of human knowledge, an
audacious tyranny over the mind of man. The example once set, there was
no want of followers; the works of the Greek philosophers were
stigmatized as profane; the transcendently glorious achievements of the
Museum of Alexandria were hidden from sight by a cloud of ignorance,
mysticism, and unintelligible jargon, out of which there too often
flashed the destroying lightnings of ecclesiastical vengeance." <span
id="fr_125"></span>[\*\*](#fn_125)

Augustine and Cyprian <span id="fr_126"></span>[\*\*\*](#fn_126) admit
that Hermes and Hostanes believed in one true god; the first two
maintaining, as well as the two Pagans, that he is invisible and
incomprehensible, except spiritually. Moreover we invite any man of
intelligence--provided he be not a religious fanatic--after reading
fragments chosen at random from the works of Hermes

###### <span id="page_89">p. 89</span>

and Augustine on the Deity, to decide which of the two gives a more
philosophical definition of the "unseen Father." We have at least one
writer of fame who is of our opinion. Draper calls the Augustinian
productions a "rhapsodical conversation" with God; an "incoherent
dream." <span id="fr_127"></span>[\*](#fn_127)

Father Ventura depicts the saint as attitudinizing before an astonished
world upon "the most sublime heights of philosophy." But here steps in
again the same unprejudiced critic, who passes the following remarks on
this colossus of Patristic philosophy. "Was it for this preposterous
scheme," he asks, "this product of ignorance and audacity, that the
works of the Greek philosophers were to be given up? It was none too
soon that the great critics who appeared at the Reformation, by
comparing the works of these writers with one another, brought them to
their proper level, and taught us to look upon them all with
contempt." <span id="fr_128"></span>[\*\*](#fn_128)

For such men as Plotinus, Porphyry, Iamblichus, Apollonius, and even
Simon Magus, to be accused of having formed a pact with the Devil,
whether the latter personage exist or not, is so absurd as to need but
little refutation. If Simon Magus--the most problematical of all in an
historical sense--ever existed otherwise than in the overheated fancy of
Peter and the other apostles, he was evidently no worse than any of his
adversaries. A difference in religious views, however great, is
insufficient *per se* to send one person to heaven and the other to
hell. Such uncharitable and peremptory doctrines might have been taught
in the middle ages; but it is too late now for even the Church to put
forward this traditional scarecrow. Research begins to suggest that
which, if ever verified, will bring eternal disgrace on the Church of
the Apostle Peter, whose very imposition of herself upon that disciple
must be regarded as the most unverified and unverifiable of the
assumptions of the Catholic clergy.

The erudite author of *Supernatural Religion* assiduously endeavors to
prove that by *Simon Magus* we must understand the apostle Paul, whose
Epistles were secretly as well as openly calumniated by Peter, and
charged with containing "*dysnoetic* learning." The Apostle of the
Gentiles was brave, outspoken, sincere, and very learned; the Apostle of
Circumcision, cowardly, cautious, *insincere,* and very ignorant. That
Paul had been, partially, at least, if not completely, initiated into
the theurgic mysteries, admits of little doubt. His language, the
phraseology so peculiar to the Greek philosophers, certain expressions
used but by the initiates, are so many sure ear-marks to that
supposition. Our suspicion has been strengthened by an able article in
one of the New York periodicals,

###### <span id="page_90">p. 90</span>

entitled *Paul and Plato*, <span id="fr_129"></span>[\*](#fn_129) in
which the author puts forward one remarkable and, for us, very precious
observation. In his *Epistles to the Corinthians* he shows Paul
abounding with "expressions suggested by the initiations of Sabazius and
Eleusis, and the lectures of the (Greek) philosophers. He (Paul)
designates himself an *idiotes--*a person unskilful in the Word, but not
in the *gnosis* or philosophical learning. 'We speak wisdom among the
perfect or initiated,' he writes; 'not the wisdom of this world, nor of
the archons of this world, but divine wisdom in a mystery, secret--which
*none of the Archons of this world knew*.' " <span
id="fr_130"></span>[\*\*](#fn_130) What else can the apostle mean by
these unequivocal words, but that he himself, as belonging to the
*mystae* (initiated), spoke of things shown and explained only in the
Mysteries? The "divine wisdom in a mystery which none of the *archons of
this world knew,*" has evidently some direct reference to the *basileus*
of the Eleusinian initiation who *did know.* The *basileus* belonged to
the staff of the great hierophant, and was an *archon* of Athens; and as
such was one of the chief *mystae*, belonging to the *interior*
Mysteries, to which a very select and small number obtained an
entrance. <span id="fr_131"></span>[\*\*\*](#fn_131) The magistrates
supervising the Eleusinians were called archons.

Another proof that Paul belonged to the circle of the "Initiates" lies
in the following fact. The apostle had his head shorn at Cenchrea (where
Lucius, *Apulcius,* was initiated) because "he had a vow." The
*nazars--*or set apart--as we see in the Jewish Scriptures, had to cut
their hair which they wore long, and which "no razor touched" at any
other time, and sacrifice it on the altar of initiation. And the nazars
were a class of Chaldean theurgists. We will show further that Jesus
belonged to this class.

Paul declares that: "According to the grace of God which is given unto
me, as a wise *master-builder,* I have laid the foundation." <span
id="fr_132"></span>[\*\*\*\*](#fn_132)

This expression, master-builder, used only *once* in the whole *Bible,*
and by Paul, may be considered as a whole revelation. In the Mysteries,
the third part of the sacred rites was called *Epopteia,* or revelation,
reception into the secrets. In substance it means that stage of divine
clairvoyance when everything pertaining to this earth disappears, and
earthly sight is paralyzed, and the soul is united free and pure with
its Spirit, or God. But the real significance of the word is
"overseeing," from οπτομαι--*I see myself.* In Sanscrit the word
*evapto* has the same meaning, as

###### <span id="page_91">p. 91</span>

well as *to obtain*. <span id="fr_133"></span>[\*](#fn_133) The word
*epopteia* is a compound one, from Επι--upon, and οπτομαι-- to look, or
an overseer, an inspector--also used for a master-builder. The title of
master-mason, in Freemasonry, is derived from this, in the sense used in
the Mysteries. Therefore, when Paul entitles himself a "master-builder,"
he is using a word pre-eminently kabalistic, theurgic, and masonic, and
one which no other apostle uses. He thus declares himself an *adept,*
having the right to *initiate* others.

If we search in this direction, with those sure guides, the Grecian
Mysteries and the *Kabala,* before us, it will be easy to find the
secret reason why Paul was so persecuted and hated by Peter, John, and
James. The author of the *Revelation* was a Jewish kabalist *pur sang,*
with all the hatred inherited by him from his forefathers toward the
Mysteries. <span id="fr_134"></span>[\*\*](#fn_134) His jealousy during
the life of Jesus extended even to Peter; and it is but after the death
of their common master that we see the two apostles--the former of whom
wore the Mitre and the Petaloon of the Jewish Rabbis--preach so
zealously the rite of circumcision. In the eyes of Peter, Paul, who had
humiliated him, and whom he felt so much his superior in "Greek
learning" and philosophy, must have naturally appeared as a magician, a
man polluted with the "*Gnosis,*" with the "wisdom" of the Greek
Mysteries--hence, perhaps, "Simon <span
id="fr_135"></span>[\*\*\*](#fn_135) the Magician."

As to Peter, biblical criticism has shown before now that he had
probably no more to do with the foundation of the Latin Church at Rome,
than to furnish the pretext so readily seized upon by the cunning
Irenaeus to benefit this Church with the new name of the
apostle--*Petra* or *Kiffa,* a name which allowed so readily, by an easy
play upon words to connect it with *Petroma,* the double set of stone
tablets used

###### <span id="page_92">p. 92</span>

by the hierophant at the initiations, during the final Mystery. In this,
perhaps, lies concealed the whole secret of the claims of the Vatican.
As Professor Wilder happily suggests: "In the Oriental countries the
designation <span id="img_iu2-92a"></span> ![](img/iu2-92a.jpg), Peter
(in Phoenician and Chaldaic, an interpreter) appears to have been the
title of this personage (the hierophant). . . . There is in these facts
some reminder of the peculiar circumstances of the Mosaic Law . . . and
also of the claim of the Pope to be the successor of Peter, the
hierophant or interpreter of the Christian religion." <span
id="fr_136"></span>[\*](#fn_136)

As such, we must concede to him, to some extent, the right to be such an
interpreter. The Latin Church has faithfully preserved in symbols,
rites, ceremonies, architecture, and even in the very dress of her
clergy, the tradition of the Pagan worship--of the public or exoteric
ceremonies, we should add; otherwise her dogmas would embody more sense
and contain less blasphemy against the majesty of the Supreme and
Invisible God.

An inscription found on the coffin of Queen Mentuhept, of the eleventh
dynasty (2250 B.C.), now proved to have been transcribed from the
seventeenth chapter of the *Book of the Dead* (dating not later than
4500 B.C.), is more than suggestive. This monumental text contains a
group of hieroglyphics, which, when interpreted, read thus:

<span id="img_iu2-92b"></span> ![](img/iu2-92b.jpg)  
Baron Bunsen shows this sacred formulary mixed up with a whole series of
glosses and various interpretations on a monument forty centuries old.
"This is identical with saying that the record (the true interpretation)
was at that time no longer intelligible. . . . We beg our readers to
understand," he adds, "that a sacred text, a hymn, containing the words
of a departed spirit, existed in such a state about 4,000 years ago . .
. as to be all but unintelligible to royal scribes." <span
id="fr_137"></span>[\*\*](#fn_137)

That it was unintelligible to the uninitiated among the latter is as
well proved by the confused and contradictory glossaries, as that it was
a "mystery"-word, known to the hierophants of the sanctuaries, and,
moreover, a word chosen by Jesus, to designate the office assigned by
him to one of his apostles. This word, **PTR**, was partially
interpreted, owing to another word similarly written in another group of
hieroglyphics, on a

###### <span id="page_93">p. 93</span>

stele, the sign used for it being an opened eye. <span
id="fr_138"></span>[\*](#fn_138) Bunsen mentions as another explanation
of **PTR**--"to show." "It appears to me," he remarks, "that our **PTR**
is literally the old Aramaic and Hebrew 'Patar,' which occurs in the
history of Joseph as the specific word for *interpreting*; whence also
*Pitrum* is the term for interpretation of a text, a dream." <span
id="fr_139"></span>[\*\*](#fn_139) In a manuscript of the first century,
a combination of the Demotic and Greek texts, <span
id="fr_140"></span>[\*\*\*](#fn_140) and most probably one of the few
which miraculously escaped the Christian vandalism of the second and
third centuries, when all such precious manuscripts were burned as
magical, we find occurring in several places a phrase, which, perhaps,
may throw some light upon this question. One of the principal heroes of
the manuscript, who is constantly referred to as "the Judean
Illuminator" or Initiate, Τελειοτεσ, is made to communicate but with his
*Patar;* the latter being written in Chaldaic characters. Once the
latter word is coupled with the name *Shimeon.* Several times, the
"Illuminator," who rarely breaks his contemplative solitude, is shown
inhabiting a Κρυπτε (cave), and teaching the multitudes of eager
scholars standing outside, not orally, but through this *Patar.* The
latter receives the words of wisdom by applying his ear to a circular
hole in a partition which conceals the teacher from the listeners, and
then conveys them, with explanations and glossaries, to the crowd. This,
with a slight change, was the method used by Pythagoras, who, as we
know, never allowed his neophytes to see him during the years of
probation, but instructed them from behind a curtain in his cave.

But, whether the "Illuminator" of the Graeco-Demotic manuscript is
identical with Jesus or not, the fact remains, that we find him
selecting a "mystery"-appellation for one who is made to appear later by
the Catholic Church as the janitor of the Kingdom of Heaven and the
interpreter of Christ's will. The word Patar or Peter locates both
master and disciple in the circle of initiation, and connects them with
the "Secret Doctrine." The great hierophant of the ancient Mysteries
never allowed the candidates to see or hear him personally. He was the
Deus-ex-Machina, the presiding but invisible Deity, uttering his will
and instructions through a second party; and 2,000 years later, we
discover that the Dalai-Lamas of Thibet had been following for centuries
the same traditional programme during the most important religious
mysteries of lamaism.

###### <span id="page_94">p. 94</span>

If Jesus knew the secret meaning of the title bestowed by him on Simon,
then he must have been initiated; otherwise he could not have learned
it; and if he was an initiate of either the Pythagorean Essenes, the
Chaldean Magi, or the Egyptian Priests, then the doctrine taught by him
was but a portion of the "Secret Doctrine" taught by the Pagan
hierophants to the few select adepts admitted within the sacred adyta.

But we will discuss this question further on. For the present we will
endeavor to briefly indicate the extraordinary similarity--or rather
identity, we should say--of rites and ceremonial dress of the Christian
clergy with that of the old Babylonians, Assyrians, Phoenicians,
Egyptians, and other Pagans of the hoary antiquity.

If we would find the model of the Papal tiara, we must search the annals
of the ancient Assyrian tablets. We invite the reader to give his
attention to Dr. Inman's illustrated work, *Ancient Pagan and Modern
Christian* *Symbolism.* On page sixty-four, he will readily recognize
the head-gear of the successor of St. Peter in the coiffure worn by gods
or angels in ancient Assyria, "where it appears crowned by an emblem of
the *male* trinity" (the Christian Cross). "We may mention, in passing,"
adds Dr. Inman, "that, as the Romanists adopted the mitre and the tiara
from 'the cursed brood of Ham,' so they adopted the Episcopalian crook
from the augurs of Etruria, and the artistic form with which they clothe
their angels from the painters and urn-makers of Magna Grecia and
Central Italy."

Would we push our inquiries farther, and seek to ascertain as much in
relation to the nimbus and the tonsure of the Catholic priest and
monk? <span id="fr_141"></span>[\*](#fn_141) We shall find undeniable
proofs that they are solar emblems. Knight, in his *Old England
Pictorially Illustrated,* gives a drawing by St. Augustine, representing
an ancient Christian bishop, in a dress probably identical with that
worn by the great "saint" himself. The *pallium,* or the ancient stole
of the bishop, is the feminine sign when worn by a priest in worship. On
St. Augustine's picture it is bedecked with Buddhistic crosses, and in
its whole appearance it is a representation of the Egyptian <span
id="img_sd1-5e"></span> ![](img/sd1-5e.jpg)(tau), assuming slightly the
figure of the letter <span id="img_iu2-94"></span> ![](img/iu2-94.jpg).
"Its lower end is the mark of the masculine triad," says Inman; "the
right hand (of the figure) has the forefinger extended, like the
Assyrian priests while doing homage *to the grove*. . . . When a male
dons the pallium in worship, he becomes the representative of the
trinity in the unity, the *arba,* or mystic four." <span
id="fr_142"></span>[\*\*](#fn_142)

"Immaculate is our Lady Isis," is the legend around an engraving

###### <span id="page_95">p. 95</span>

of Serapis and Isis, described by King, in *The Gnostics and their
Remains*, Ἐ ΚΥΡΙΑ ΕΙΚΙΚ ΑΓΝΕ ". . . the very terms applied afterwards to
that personage (the Virgin Mary) who succeeded to her form, titles,
symbols, rites, and ceremonies. . . . Thus, her devotees carried into
the new priesthood the former badges of their profession, the obligation
to celibacy, the tonsure, and the surplice, omitting, unfortunately, the
frequent ablutions prescribed by the ancient creed." "The 'Black
Virgins,' so highly reverenced in certain French cathedrals . . .
proved, when at last critically examined, basalt figures of Isis"! <span
id="fr_143"></span>[\*](#fn_143)

Before the shrine of Jupiter Ammon were suspended tinkling bells, from
the sound of whose chiming the priests gathered the auguries; "A golden
bell and a pomegranate . . . round about the hem of the robe," was the
result with the Mosaic Jews. But in the Buddhistic system, during the
religious services, the gods of the Deva Loka are always invoked, and
invited to descend upon the altars by the ringing of bells suspended in
the pagodas. The bell of the sacred table of Siva at Kuhama is described
in Kailasa, and every Buddhist vihara and lamasery has its bells.

We thus see that the bells used by Christians come to them directly from
the Buddhist Thibetans and Chinese. The beads and rosaries have the same
origin, and have been used by Buddhist monks for over 2,300 years. The
*Linghams* in the Hindu temples are ornamented upon certain days with
large berries, from a tree sacred to Mahadeva, which are strung into
rosaries. The title of "nun" is an Egyptian word, and had with them the
actual meaning; the Christians did not even take the trouble of
translating the word *Nonna.* The aureole of the saints was used by the
antediluvian artists of Babylonia, whenever they desired to honor or
deify a mortal's head. In a celebrated picture in Moore's *Hindoo
Pantheon,* entitled, "Christna nursed by Devaki, from a highly-finished
picture," the Hindu Virgin is represented as seated on a lounge and
nursing Christna. The hair brushed back, the long veil, and the golden
aureole around the Virgin's head, as well as around that of the Hindu
Saviour, are striking. No Catholic, well versed as he might be in the
mysterious symbolism of iconology, would hesitate for a moment to
worship at that shrine the Virgin Mary, the mother of his God! <span
id="fr_144"></span>[\*\*](#fn_144) In Indur Subba, the south entrance of
the Caves of Ellora, may be seen to this day the figure of Indra's wife,
Indranee, sitting with her infant son-god, pointing the finger to heaven
with the same gesture as the Italian Madonna and child. In *Pagan and
Christian Symbolism,* the author gives a figure from a

###### <span id="page_96">p. 96</span>

mediaeval woodcut--the like of which we have seen by dozens in old
psalters--in which the Virgin Mary, with her infant, is represented as
the Queen of Heaven, on the crescent moon, emblem of virginity. "Being
before the sun, she almost eclipses its light. Than this, nothing could
more completely identify the Christian mother and child with Isis and
Horus, Ishtar, Venus, Juno, and a host of other Pagan goddesses, who
have been called 'Queen of Heaven,' 'Queen of the Universe,' 'Mother of
God,' 'Spouse of God,' 'the Celestial Virgin,' 'the Heavenly
Peace-Maker,' etc." <span id="fr_145"></span>[\*](#fn_145)

Such pictures are not purely astronomical. They represent the male god
and the female goddess, as the sun and moon in conjunction, "the union
of the triad with the unit." The horns of the cow on the head of Isis
have the same significance.

And so above, below, outside, and inside, the Christian Church, in the
priestly garments, and the religious rites, we recognize the stamp of
exoteric heathenism. On no subject within the wide range of human
knowledge, has the world been more blinded or deceived with such
persistent misrepresentation as on that of antiquity. Its hoary past and
its religious faiths have been misrepresented and trampled under the
feet of its successors. Its hierophants and prophets, mystae and
epoptae, <span id="fr_146"></span>[\*\*](#fn_146) of the once sacred
adyta of the temple shown as demoniacs and devil-worshippers. Donned in
the despoiled garments of the victim, the Christian priest now
anathematizes the latter with rites and ceremonies which he has learned
from the theurgists themselves. The Mosaic *Bible* is used as a weapon
against the people who furnished it. The heathen philosopher is cursed
under the very roof which has witnessed his initiation; and the "monkey
of God" (*i.e*., the devil of Tertullian), "the originator and founder
of magical theurgy, the science of illusions and lies, whose father and
author is the demon," is exorcised with holy water by the hand which
holds the identical *lituus <span id="fr_147"></span>[\*\*\*](#fn_147)*
with which the ancient augur, after a solemn prayer, used to determine
the regions of heaven, and evoke, in the name of the HIGHEST, the minor
god (now termed the Devil), who unveiled to his eyes futurity, and
enabled him to prophesy! On the part of the Christians and the clergy it
is nothing but shameful ignorance, prejudice, and that contemptible
pride so boldly denounced by one of their own reverend ministers, T.
Gross, <span id="fr_148"></span>[\*\*\*\*](#fn_148) which rails against
all investigation "as a useless or a criminal labor, when it must be
feared that they will result in the overthrow of preestablished systems
of faith." On the part of the scholars it is the same apprehension of
the possible necessity of having to

###### <span id="page_97">p. 97</span>

modify some of their erroneously-established theories of science.
"Nothing but such pitiable prejudice," says Gross, "can have thus
misrepresented the theology of heathenism, and distorted--nay,
caricatured--its forms of religious worship. It is time that posterity
should raise its voice in vindication of violated truth, and that the
present age should learn a little of that common sense of which it
boasts with as much self-complacency as if the prerogative of reason was
the birthright only of modern times."

All this gives a sure clew to the real cause of the hatred felt by the
early and mediaeval Christian toward his Pagan brother and dangerous
rival. We hate but what we fear. The Christian thaumaturgist once having
broken all association with the Mysteries of the temples and with "these
schools so renowned for magic," described by St. Hilarion, <span
id="fr_149"></span>[\*](#fn_149) could certainly expect but little to
rival the Pagan wonder-workers. No apostle, with the exception perhaps
of healing by mesmeric power, has ever equalled Apollonius of Tyana; and
the scandal created among the apostles by the miracle-doing Simon Magus,
is too notorious to be repeated here again. "How is it," asks Justin
Martyr, in evident dismay, "how is it that the talismans of Apollonius
(the τελεσματα) have power in certain members of creation, for they
prevent, *as we see,* the fury of the waves, and the violence of the
winds, and the attacks of wild beasts; and whilst our Lord's miracles
are preserved by tradition alone, those of Apollonius *are most
numerous,* and actually manifested in present facts, so as to lead
astray all beholders?" <span id="fr_150"></span>[\*\*](#fn_150) This
perplexed martyr solves the problem by attributing very correctly the
efficacy and potency of the charms used by Apollonius to his profound
knowledge of the sympathies and antipathies (or repugnances) of nature.

Unable to deny the evident superiority of their enemies' powers, the
fathers had recourse to the old but ever successful method--that of
slander. They honored the theurgists with the same insinuating calumny
that had been resorted to by the Pharisees against Jesus. "Thou hast a
daemon," the elders of the Jewish Synagogue had said to him. "Thou hast
the Devil," repeated the cunning fathers, with equal truth, addressing
the Pagan thaumaturgist; and the widely-bruited charge, erected later
into an article of faith, won the day.

But the modern heirs of these ecclesiastical falsifiers, who charge
magic, spiritualism, and even magnetism with being produced by a demon,
forget or perhaps never read the classics. None of our bigots has ever
looked with more scorn on the *abuses* of magic than did the true
initiate

###### <span id="page_98">p. 98</span>

of old. No modern or even mediaeval law could be more severe than that
of the hierophant. True, he had more discrimination, charity, and
justice, than the Christian clergy; for while banishing the
"unconscious" sorcerer, the person troubled with a demon, from within
the sacred precincts of the adyta, the priests, instead of mercilessly
burning him, took care of the unfortunate "possessed one." Having
hospitals expressly for that purpose in the neighborhood of temples, the
ancient "medium," if obsessed, was taken care of and restored to health.
But with one who had, by conscious *witchcraft,* acquired powers
dangerous to his fellow-creatures, the priests of old were as severe as
justice herself. "Any person *accidentally* guilty of homicide, or of
any crime, or convicted of *witchcraft,* was excluded from the
Eleusinian Mysteries." <span id="fr_151"></span>[\*](#fn_151) And so
were they from all others. This law, mentioned by all writers on the
ancient initiation, speaks for itself. The claim of Augustine, that all
the explanations given by the Neo-platonists were invented by themselves
is absurd. For nearly every ceremony in their true and successive order
is given by Plato himself, in a more or less covered way. The Mysteries
are as old as the world, and one well versed in the esoteric mythologies
of various nations can trace them back to the days of the ante-Vedic
period in India. A condition of the strictest virtue and purity is
required from the *Vatou,* or candidate in India before he can become an
initiate, whether he aims to be a simple fakir, a *Purohita* (public
priest) or a *Sannyasi,* a saint of the second degree of initiation, the
most holy as the most revered of them all. After having conquered, in
the terrible trials preliminary to admittance to the inner temple in the
subterranean crypts of his pagoda, the sannyasi passes the rest of his
life in the temple, practicing the eighty-four rules and ten virtues
prescribed to the Yogis.

"No one who has not practiced, during his whole life, the ten virtues
which the divine Manu makes incumbent as a duty, can be initiated into
the Mysteries of the council," say the Hindu books of initiation.

These virtues are: "Resignation; the act of rendering good for evil;
temperance; probity; purity; chastity; repression of the physical
senses; the knowledge of the Holy Scriptures; that of the *Superior*
soul (spirit); worship of truth; abstinence from anger." These virtues
must alone direct the life of a true Yogi. "No unworthy adept ought to
defile the ranks of the holy initiates by his presence for twenty-four
hours." The adept becomes guilty after having once broken any one of
these vows. Surely the exercise of such virtues is inconsistent with the
idea one has of *devil*-worship and lasciviousness of purpose!

And now we will try to give a clear insight into one of the chief
objects

###### <span id="page_99">p. 99</span>

of this work. What we desire to prove is, that underlying every ancient
popular religion was the same ancient wisdom-doctrine, one and
identical, professed and practiced by the initiates of every country,
who alone were aware of its existence and importance. To ascertain its
origin, and the precise age in which it was matured, is now beyond human
possibility. A single glance, however, is enough to assure one that it
could not have attained the marvellous perfection in which we find it
pictured to us in the relics of the various esoteric systems, except
after a succession of ages. A philosophy so profound, a moral code so
ennobling, and practical results so conclusive and so uniformly
demonstrable is not the growth of a generation, or even a single epoch.
Fact must have been piled upon fact, deduction upon deduction, science
have begotten science, and myriads of the brightest human intellects
have reflected upon the laws of nature, before this ancient doctrine had
taken concrete shape. The proofs of this identity of fundamental
doctrine in the old religions are found in the prevalence of a system of
initiation; in the secret sacerdotal castes who had the guardianship of
mystical words of power, and a public display of a phenomenal control
over natural forces, indicating association with preterhuman beings.
Every approach to the Mysteries of all these nations was guarded with
the same jealous care, and in all, the penalty of death was inflicted
upon initiates of any degree who divulged the secrets entrusted to them.
We have seen that such was the case in the Eleusinian and Bacchic
Mysteries, among the Chaldean Magi, and the Egyptian hierophants; while
with the Hindus, from whom they were all derived, the same rule has
prevailed from time immemorial. We are left in no doubt upon this point;
for the *Agrushada Parikshai* says explicitly, "Every initiate, to
whatever degree he may belong, who reveals the great sacred formula,
must be put to death."

Naturally enough, this same extreme penalty was prescribed in all the
multifarious sects and brotherhoods which at different periods have
sprung from the ancient stock. We find it with the early Essenes,
Gnostics, theurgic Neo-platonists, and mediaeval philosophers; and in
our day, even the Masons perpetuate the memory of the old obligations in
the penalties of throat-cutting, dismemberment, and disemboweling, with
which the candidate is threatened. As the Masonic "master's word" is
communicated only at "low breath," so the selfsame precaution is
prescribed in the Chaldean *Book of Numbers* and the Jewish *Mercaba.*
When initiated, the neophyte was led by an *ancient* to a secluded spot,
and there the latter whispered *in his ear* the great secret. <span
id="fr_152"></span>[\*](#fn_152) The Mason swears, under the most
frightful penalties, that he will not communicate the secrets of

###### <span id="page_100">p. 100</span>

any degree "to a brother of an *inferior degree*"; and the *Agrushada
Parikshai* says: "Any initiate of the third degree who reveals before
the prescribed time, to the initiates of the second degree, the superior
truths, must be put to death." Again, the Masonic apprentice consents to
have his "tongue torn out by the roots" if he divulge anything to a
profane; and in the Hindu books of initiation, the same *Agrushada
Parikshai,* we find that any initiate of the first degree (the lowest)
who betrays the secrets of his initiation, to members of other castes,
for whom the science should be a closed book, must have "his *tongue cut
out,*" and suffer other mutilations.

As we proceed, we will point out the evidences of this identity of vows,
formulas, rites, and doctrines, between the ancient faiths. We will also
show that not only their memory is still preserved in India, but also
that the Secret Association is still alive and as active as ever. That,
after reading what we have to say, it may be inferred that the chief
pontiff and hierophants, the *Brahmatma,* is still accessible to those
"who know," though perhaps recognized by another name; and that the
ramifications of his influence extend throughout the world. But we will
now return again to the early Christian period.

As though he were not aware that there was any esoteric significance to
the exoteric symbols, and that the Mysteries themselves were composed of
two parts, the lesser at Agrae, and the higher ones at Eleusinia,
Clemens Alexandrinus, with a rancorous bigotry that one might expect
from a renegade Neo-platonist, but is astonished to find in this
generally honest and learned Father, stigmatized the Mysteries as
indecent and diabolical. Whatever were the rites enacted among the
neophytes before they passed to a higher form of instruction; however
misunderstood were the trials of *Katharsis* or purification, during
which they were submitted to every kind of probation; and however much
the immaterial or physical aspect might have led to calumny, it is but
wicked prejudice which can compel a person to say that under this
external meaning there was not a far deeper and spiritual significance.

It is positively absurd to judge the ancients from our own standpoint of
propriety and virtue. And most assuredly it is not for the Church--which
now stands accused by all the modern symbologists of having adopted
precisely these same emblems in their coarsest aspect, and feels herself
powerless to refute the accusations--to throw the stone at those who
were her models. When men like Pythagoras, Plato, and Iamblichus,
renowned for their severe morality, took part in the Mysteries, and
spoke of them with veneration, it ill behooves our modern critics to
judge them so rashly upon their merely external aspects. Iamblichus
explains the worst; and his explanation, for an unprejudiced mind, ought
to be

###### <span id="page_101">p. 101</span>

perfectly plausible. "Exhibitions of this kind," he says, "in the
Mysteries were designed to free us from licentious passions, by
gratifying the sight, and at the same time vanquishing all evil thought,
through *the awful sanctity* with which these rites were
accompanied." <span id="fr_153"></span>[\*](#fn_153) "The wisest and
best men in the Pagan world," adds Dr. Warburton, "are unanimous in
this, that the Mysteries were instituted pure, and proposed the noblest
ends by the worthiest means." <span id="fr_154"></span>[\*\*](#fn_154)

In these celebrated rites, although persons of both sexes and all
classes were allowed to take a part, and a participation in them was
even obligatory, very few indeed attained the higher and final
initiation. The gradation of the Mysteries is given us by Proclus in the
fourth book of his *Theology of Plato.* "The perfective rite τελετε,
precedes in order the initiation--*Muesis--*and the initiation,
*Epopteia,* or the final apocalypse (revelation)." Theon of Smyrna, in
*Mathematica,* also divides the mystic rites into five parts: "the first
of which is the previous purification; for *neither are the Mysteries
communicated to all* who are willing to receive them; . . . there are
certain persons who are prevented by the voice of the crier (Κερυξ) . .
. since it is necessary that such as are not expelled from the Mysteries
should first be refined by certain purifications which the reception of
the sacred rites succeeds. The third part is denominated *epopteia* or
reception. And the fourth, which is the end and design of the
revelation, is *the binding of the head and fixing of the crowns* <span
id="fr_155"></span>[\*\*\*](#fn_155) . . . whether after this he (the
initiated person) becomes . . . an hierophant or sustains some other
part of the sacerdotal office. But the fifth, which is produced from all
these, *is friendship and interior communion with God.*" And this was
the last and most awful of all the Mysteries.

There are writers who have often wondered at the meaning of this claim
to a "friendship and interior communion with God." Christian authors
have denied the pretensions of the "Pagans" to such "communion,"
affirming that only Christian saints were and are capable of enjoying
it; materialistic skeptics have altogether scoffed at the idea of both.
After long ages of religious materialism and spiritual stagnation, it
has most certainly become difficult if not altogether impossible to
substantiate the claims of either party. The old Greeks, who had once
crowded

around the Agora of Athens, with its altar to the "Unknown God," are no
more; and their descendants firmly believe that they have found the
"Unknown" in the Jewish Jehova. The divine ecstasies of the early
Christians have made room for visions of a more modern character, in
perfect keeping with progress and civilization. The "Son of man"
appearing to the rapt vision of the ancient Christian as coming from the
seventh heaven, in a cloud of glory, and surrounded with angels and
winged seraphim, has made room for a more prosaic and at the same time
more business-like Jesus. The latter is now shown as making morning
calls upon Mary and Martha in Bethany; as seating himself on "the
*ottoman*" with the younger sister, a lover of "ethics," while Martha
goes off to the kitchen to cook. Anon the heated fancy of a blasphemous
Brooklyn preacher and harlequin, the Reverend Dr. Talmage, makes us see
her rushing back "with besweated brow, a pitcher in one hand and the
tongs in the other . . . into the presence of Christ," and blowing him
up for not caring that her sister hath left her "to serve alone." <span
id="fr_156"></span>[\*](#fn_156)

From the birth of the solemn and majestic conception of the unrevealed
Deity of the ancient adepts to such caricatured descriptions of him who
died on the Cross for his philanthropic devotion to humanity, long
centuries have intervened, and their heavy tread seems to have almost
entirely obliterated all sense of a spiritual religion from the hearts
of his professed followers. No wonder then, that the sentence of Proclus
is no longer understood by the Christians, and is rejected as a
"vaglary" by the materialists, who, in their negation, are less
blasphemous and atheistical than many of the reverends and members of
the churches. But, although the Greek *epoptai* are no more, we have
now, in our own age, a people far more ancient than the oldest Hellenes,
who practice the so-called "preterhuman" gifts to the same extent as did
their ancestors far earlier than the days of Troy. It is to this people
that we draw the attention of the psychologist and philosopher.

One need not go very deep into the literature of the Orientalists to
become convinced that in most cases they do not even suspect that in

###### <span id="page_103">p. 103</span>DEGREE.

the arcane philosophy of India there are depths which they have not
sounded, and *cannot* sound, for they pass on without perceiving them.
There is a pervading tone of conscious superiority, a ring of contempt
in the treatment of Hindu metaphysics, as though the European mind is
alone enlightened enough to polish the rough diamond of the old Sanscrit
writers, and separate right from wrong for the benefit of their
descendants. We see them disputing over the external forms of expression
without a conception of the great vital truths these hide from the
profane view.

"As a rule, the Brahmans," says Jacolliot, "rarely go beyond the class
of *grihesta* \[priests of the vulgar castes\] and *purahita*
\[exorcisers, divines, prophets, and evocators of spirits\]. And yet, we
shall see . . . once that we have touched upon the question and study of
manifestations and phenomena, that these initiates of the *first* degree
(the lowest) attribute to themselves, and in appearance possess
faculties developed to a degree which has never been equalled in Europe.
As to the initiates of the second and especially of the third category,
they pretend to be enabled to ignore time, space, and to command life
and death." <span id="fr_157"></span>[\*](#fn_157)

Such initiates as these M. Jacolliot *did not meet;* for, as he says
himself, they only appear on the most solemn occasions, and when the
faith of the multitudes has to be strengthened by phenomena of a
superior order. "They are never seen, either in the neighborhood of, or
even inside the temples, except at the grand quinquennial festival of
the fire. On that occasion, they appear about the middle of the night,
on a platform erected in the centre of the sacred lake, like so many
phantoms, and by their conjurations they illumine the space. A fiery
column of light ascends from around them, rushing from earth to heaven.
Unfamiliar sounds vibrate through the air, and five or six hundred
thousand Hindus, gathered from every part of India to contemplate these
demi-gods, throw themselves with their faces buried in the dust,
invoking the souls of their ancestors." <span
id="fr_158"></span>[\*\*](#fn_158)

Let any impartial person read the *Spiritisme dans le Monde,* and he
cannot believe that this "implacable rationalist," as Jacolliot takes
pride in terming himself, said one word more than is warranted by what
he had seen. His statements support and are corroborated by those of
other skeptics. As a rule, the missionaries, even after passing half a
lifetime in the country of "devil-worship," as they call India, either
disingenuously *deny* altogether what they cannot help knowing to be
true, or ridiculously attribute phenomena to this power of the Devil,
that outrival the "miracles" of the apostolic ages. And what do we see
this French

###### <span id="page_104">p. 104</span>

author, notwithstanding his incorrigible rationalism, forced to admit,
after having narrated the greatest wonders? Watch the fakirs as he
would, he is compelled to bear the strongest testimony to their perfect
honesty in the matter of their miraculous phenomena. "Never," he says,
"have we succeeded in detecting a single one in the act of deceit." One
fact should be noted by all who, without having been in India, still
fancy they are clever enough to expose the fraud of *pretended*
magicians. This skilled and cool observer, this redoubtable materialist,
after his long sojourn in India, affirms, "We unhesitatingly avow that
we have not met, either in India or in Ceylon, a single European, even
among the oldest residents, who has been able to indicate the means
employed by these devotees for the production of these phenomena!"

And how should they? Does not this zealous Orientalist confess to us
that even he, who had every available means at hand to learn many of
their rites and doctrines at first hand, failed in his attempts to make
the Brahmans explain to him their secrets. "All that our most diligent
inquiries of the Pourohitas could elicit from them respecting the acts
of their superiors (the invisible initiates of the temples), amounts to
very little." And again, speaking of one of the books, he confesses
that, while purporting to reveal all that is desirable to know, it
"falls back into mysterious formulas, in combinations of magical and
occult letters, the secret of which it has been impossible for us to
penetrate," etc.

The fakirs, although they can never reach beyond the first degree of
initiation, are, notwithstanding, the only agents between the living
world and the "silent brothers," or those initiates who never cross the
thresholds of their sacred dwellings. The Fukara-Yogis belong to the
temples, and who knows but these cenobites of the sanctuary have far
more to do with the psychological phenomena which attend the fakirs, and
have been so graphically described by Jacolliot, than the *Pitris*
themselves? Who can tell but that the fluidic spectre of the ancient
Brahman seen by Jacolliot was the Scin-lecca, the spiritual *double,* of
one of these mysterious sannyasi?

Although the story has been translated and commented upon by Professor
Perty, of Geneva, still we will venture to give it in Jacolliot's own
words: "A moment after the disappearance of the hands, the fakir
continuing his evocations (*mantras*) more earnestly than ever, a cloud
like the first, but more opalescent and more opaque, began to hover near
the small brasier, which, by request of the Hindu, I had constantly fed
with live coals. Little by little it assumed a form entire human, and I
distinguished the spectre--for I cannot call it otherwise--of an old
Brahman sacrificator, kneeling near the little brasier.

"He bore on his forehead the signs sacred to Vishnu, and around his

###### <span id="page_105">p. 105</span>

body the triple cord, sign of the initiates of the priestly caste. He
joined his hands above his head, as during the sacrifices, and his lips
moved as if they were reciting prayers. At a given moment, he took a
pinch of perfumed powder, and threw it upon the coals; it must have been
a strong compound, for a thick smoke arose on the instant, and filled
the two chambers.

"When it was dissipated, I perceived the spectre, which, two steps from
me, was extending to me its fleshless hand; I took it in mine, making a
salutation, and I was astonished to find it, although bony and hard,
warm and living.

" 'Art thou, indeed,' said I at this moment, in a loud voice, 'an
ancient inhabitant of the earth?'

"I had not finished the question, when the word AM, (yes) appeared and
then disappeared in letters of fire, on the breast of the old Brahman,
with an effect much like that which the word would produce if written in
the dark with a stick of phosphorus.

" 'Will you leave me nothing in token of your visit?' I continued.

"The spirit broke the triple cord, composed of three strands of cotton,
which begirt his loins, gave it to me, and vanished at my feet." <span
id="fr_159"></span>[\*](#fn_159)

"Oh Brahma! what is this mystery which takes place every night? . . .
When lying on the matting, with eyes closed, the body is lost sight of,
and the soul escapes to enter into conversation with the Pitris. . . .
Watch over it, O Brahma, when, forsaking the resting body, it goes away
to hover over the waters, to wander in the immensity of heaven, and
penetrate into the dark and mysterious nooks of the valleys and grand
forests of the Hymavat! " (*Agroushada Parikshai.*)

The fakirs, when belonging to some particular temple, never act but
under orders. Not one of them, unless he has reached a degree of
extraordinary sanctity, is freed from the influence and guidance of his
guru, his teacher, who first initiated and instructed him in the
mysteries of the *occult* sciences. Like the *subject* of the European
mesmerizer, the average fakir can never rid himself entirely of the
psychological influence exercised on him by his guru. Having passed two
or three hours in the silence and solitude of the inner temple in prayer
and meditation, the fakir, when he emerges thence, is mesmerically
strengthened and prepared; he produces wonders far more varied and
powerful than before he entered. The "master" has *laid his hands upon
him,* and the fakir feels strong.

It may be shown, on the authority of many Brahmanical and Buddhist
sacred books, that there has ever existed a great difference between

###### <span id="page_106">p. 106</span>

adepts of the higher order, and purely psychological subjects--like many
of these fakirs, who are mediums in a certain qualified sense. True, the
fakir is ever talking of Pitris, and this is natural; for they are his
protecting deities. But are the Pitris *disembodied human beings of our
race?* This is the question, and we will discuss it in a moment.

We say that the fakir may be regarded in a degree as a medium; for he
is--what is not generally known--under the direct mesmeric influence of
a living adept, his sannyasi or guru. When the latter dies, the power of
the former, unless he has received the last transfer of spiritual
forces, wanes and often even disappears. Why, if it were otherwise,
should the fakirs have been excluded from the right of advancing to the
second and third degree? The lives of many of them exemplify a degree of
self-sacrifice and sanctity unknown and utterly incomprehensible to
Europeans, who shudder at the bare thought of such self-inflicted
tortures. But however shielded from control by vulgar and earth-bound
spirits, however wide the chasm between a debasing influence and their
self-controlled souls; and however well protected by the seven-knotted
magical bamboo rod which he receives from the guru, still the fakir
lives in the outer world of sin and matter, and it is possible that his
soul may be tainted, perchance, by the magnetic emanations from profane
objects and persons, and thereby open an access to strange spirits and
*gods.* To admit one so situated, one not under any and all
circumstances sure of the mastery over himself, to a knowledge of the
awful mysteries and priceless secrets of initiation, would be
impracticable. It would not only imperil the security of that which
must, at all hazards, be guarded from profanation, but it would be
consenting to admit behind the veil a fellow being, whose mediumistic
irresponsibility might at any moment cause him to lose his life through
an involuntary indiscretion. The same law which prevailed in the
Eleusinian Mysteries before our era, holds good now in India.

Not only must the adept have mastery over himself, but he must be able
to control the inferior grades of spiritual beings, nature-spirits, and
earthbound souls, in short the very ones by whom, if by any, the fakir
is liable to be affected.

For the objector to affirm that the Brahman-adepts and the fakirs admit
that of themselves they are powerless, and can only act with the help of
disembodied human spirits, is to state that these Hindus are
unacquainted with the laws of their sacred books and even the meaning of
the word *Pitris.* The *Laws of Manu,* the *Atharva-Veda,* and other
books, prove what we now say. "All that exists," says the
*Atharva-Veda,* "is in the power of the gods. The gods are under the
power of magical conjurations. The magical conjurations are under the
control of the Brahmans. Hence

###### <span id="page_107">p. 107</span>

the gods are in the power of the Brahmans." This is logical, albeit
seemingly paradoxical, and it is the fact. And this fact will explain to
those who have not hitherto had the clew (among whom Jacolliot must be
numbered, as will appear on reading his works), why the fakir should be
confined to the first, or lowest degree of that course of initiation
whose highest adepts, or hierophants, are the *sannyasis,* or members of
the ancient Supreme Council of Seventy.

Moreover, in Book I., of the Hindu *Genesis,* or *Book of Creation* of
*Manu,* the *Pitris* are called the *lunar* ancestors of the human race.
They belong to a race of beings different from ourselves, and cannot
properly be called "human spirits" in the sense in which the
spiritualists use this term. This is what is said of them:

"Then they (the gods) created the Jackshas, the Rakshasas, the
Pisatshas, <span id="fr_160"></span>[\*](#fn_160) the Gandarbas <span
id="fr_161"></span>[\*\*](#fn_161) and the Apsaras, and the Asuras, the
Nagas, the Sarpas and the Suparnas, <span
id="fr_162"></span>[\*\*\*](#fn_162) and the Pitris--*lunar ancestors of
the human race*" (See *Institutes of Manu,* Book I., sloka 37, where the
Pitris are termed "progenitors of mankind").

The Pitris are a distinct race of spirits belonging to the mythological
hierarchy or rather to the kabalistical nomenclature, and must be
included with the good genii, the daemons of the Greeks, or the inferior
gods of the invisible world; and when a fakir attributes his phenomena
to the Pitris, he means only what the ancient philosophers and
theurgists meant when they maintained that all the "miracles" were
obtained through the intervention of the gods, or the good and bad
daemons, who control the powers of nature, the *elementals,* who are
subordinate to the power of him "who knows." A ghost or human phantom
would be termed by a fakir *palit,* or *chutna,* as that of a female
human spirit *pichhalpai,* not *pitris.* True*, pitara* means (plural)
fathers, ancestors; and pitra-i is a kinsman; but these words are used
in quite a different sense from that of the Pitris invoked in the
mantras.

To maintain before a devout Brahman or a fakir that any one can converse
with the spirits of the dead, would be to shock him with what would
appear to him blasphemy. Does not the concluding verse of the *Bagavat*
state that this supreme felicity is alone reserved to the holy
sannyasis, the gurus, and yogis?

"Long before they finally rid themselves of their mortal envelopes, the
souls who have practiced only good, such as those of the sannyasis and
the vanaprasthas, acquire the faculty of conversing with the souls which
preceded them to the swarga."

###### <span id="page_108">p. 108</span>

In this case the Pitris instead of genii are the spirits, or rather
souls, of the departed ones. But they will freely communicate only with
those whose atmosphere is as pure as their own, and to whose prayerful
*kalassa* (invocation) they can respond without the risk of defiling
their own celestial purity. When the soul of the invocator has reached
the *Sayadyam,* or perfect identity of essence with the Universal Soul,
when matter is utterly conquered, then the adept can freely enter into
daily and hourly communion with those who, though unburdened with their
corporeal forms, are still themselves progressing through the endless
series of transformations included in the gradual approach to the
Paramatma, or the grand Universal Soul.

Bearing in mind that the Christian fathers have always claimed for
themselves and their saints the name of "friends of God," and knowing
that they borrowed this expression, with many others, from the
technology of the Pagan temples, it is but natural to expect them to
show an evil temper whenever alluding to these rites. Ignorant, as a
rule, and having had biographers as ignorant as themselves, we could not
well expect them to find in the accounts of their beatific visions a
descriptive beauty such as we find in the Pagan classics. Whether the
visions and objective phenomena claimed by both the fathers of the
desert and the hierophants of the sanctuary are to be discredited, or
accepted as facts, the splendid imagery employed by Proclus and Apuleius
in narrating the small portion of the final initiation that they dared
reveal, throws completely into the shade the plagiaristic tales of the
Christian ascetics, faithful *copies* though they were intended to be.
The story of the temptation of St. Anthony in the desert by the female
demon, is a parody upon the preliminary trials of the neophyte during
the *Mikra,* or minor Mysteries of Agrae--those rites at the thought of
which Clemens railed so bitterly, and which represented the bereaved
Demeter in search of her child, and her good-natured hostess
Baubo. <span id="fr_163"></span>[\*](#fn_163)

Without entering again into a demonstration that in Christian, and
especially Irish Roman Catholic, churches <span
id="fr_164"></span>[\*\*](#fn_164) the same apparently indecent customs
as the above prevailed until the end of the last century, we will recur
to the untiring labors of that honest and brave defender of the ancient
faith, Thomas Taylor, and his works. However much dogmatic Greek
scholarship may have found to say against his "mistranslations," his
memory must be dear to every true Platonist, who seeks rather to learn
the inner thought of the great philosopher than enjoy the mere external
mechanism of his writings. Better classical translators may have

###### <span id="page_109">p. 109</span>

rendered us, in more correct phraseology, Plato's *words,* but Taylor
shows us Plato's *meaning,* and this is more than can be said of Zeller,
Jowett, and their predecessors. Yet, as writes Professor A. Wilder,
"Taylor's works have met with favor at the hands of men capable of
profound and recondite thinking; and it must be conceded that he was
endowed with a superior qualification--that of an intuitive perception
of the interior meaning of the subjects which he considered. Others may
have known more Greek, but he knew more Plato." <span
id="fr_165"></span>[\*](#fn_165)

Taylor devoted his whole useful life to the search after such old
manuscripts as would enable him to have his own speculations concerning
several obscure rites in the Mysteries corroborated by writers who had
been initiated themselves. It is with full confidence in the assertions
of various classical writers that we say that ridiculous, perhaps
licentious in some cases, as may appear ancient worship to the modern
critic, it ought not to have so appeared to the Christians. During the
mediaeval ages, and even later, they accepted pretty nearly the same
without understanding the secret import of its rites, and quite
satisfied with the obscure and rather fantastic interpretations of their
clergy, who accepted the exterior form and distorted the inner meaning.
We are ready to concede, in full justice, that centuries have passed
since the great majority of the Christian clergy, who *are not allowed
to pry into God's mysteries nor seek to explain* that which the Church
has once accepted and established, have had the remotest idea of their
symbolism, whether in its exoteric or esoteric meaning. Not so with the
head of the Church and its highest dignitaries. And if we fully agree
with Inman that it is "difficult to believe that the ecclesiastics who
sanctioned the publication of such prints <span
id="fr_166"></span>[\*\*](#fn_166) could have been as ignorant as modern
ritualists," we are not at all prepared to believe with the same author
"that the latter, if they knew the real meaning of the symbols commonly
used by the Roman Church, would *not* have adopted them."

To eliminate what is plainly derived from the sex and nature worship

###### <span id="page_110">p. 110</span>

of the ancient heathens, would be equivalent to pulling down the whole
Roman Catholic image-worship--the *Madonna* element--and reforming the
faith to Protestantism. The enforcement of the late dogma of the
Immaculation was prompted by this very secret reason. The science of
symbology was making too rapid progress. Blind faith in the Pope's
infallibility and in the immaculate nature of the Virgin and *of her
ancestral female lineage to a certain remove* could alone save the
Church from the indiscreet revelations of science. It was a clever
stroke of policy on the part of the vicegerent of God. What matters it
if, by "conferring upon her such an honor," as Don Pascale de Franciscis
naively expresses it, he has made a goddess of the Virgin Mary, an
Olympian Deity, who, having been by her very nature placed in the
impossibility of sinning, can claim no virtue, no personal merit for her
purity, precisely for which, as we were taught to believe in our younger
days, she was chosen among all other women. If his Holiness has deprived
her of this, perhaps, on the other hand, he thinks that he has endowed
her with at least one physical attribute not shared by the other
virgin-goddesses. But even this new dogma, which, in company with the
new claim to *infallibility,* has quasi-revolutionized the Christian
world, is not original with the Church of Rome. It is but a return to a
hardly-remembered *heresy* of the early Christian ages, that of the
Collyridians, so called from their *sacrificing cakes* to the Virgin,
whom they claimed to *be Virgin-born*. <span
id="fr_167"></span>[\*](#fn_167) The new sentence, "O, Virgin Mary,
*conceived without sin,*" is simply a tardy acceptance of that which was
at first deemed a "*blasphemous heresie*" by the orthodox fathers.

To think for one moment that any of the popes, cardinals, or other high
dignitaries "were not aware" from the first to the last of the external
meanings of their symbols, is to do injustice to their great learning
and their spirit of Machiavellism. It is to forget that the emissaries
of Rome will never be stopped by any difficulty which can be skirted by
the employment of Jesuitical artifice. The policy of complaisant
conformity was never carried to greater lengths than by the missionaries
in Ceylon, who, according to the Abbe Dubois--certainly a learned and
competent authority--"conducted the images of the Virgin and Saviour on
triumphal cars, imitated from the orgies of Juggernauth, and introduced
the dancers from the Brahminical rites into the ceremonial of the
church." <span id="fr_168"></span>[\*\*](#fn_168) Let us at least thank
these black-frocked politicians for their consistency in employing the
car of Juggernauth, upon which the "wicked heathen"

###### <span id="page_111">p. 111</span>

convey the *lingham* of Siva. To have used *this* car to carry in its
turn the Romish representative of the female principle in nature, is to
show discrimination and a thorough knowledge of the oldest mythological
conceptions. They have blended the two deities, and thus represented, in
a Christian procession, the "heathen" Brahma, or Nara (the father), Nari
(the mother), and Viradj (the son).

Says Manu: "The Sovereign Master who exists through himself, divides his
body into two halves, male and female, and from the union of these two
principles is born Viradj, the Son." <span
id="fr_169"></span>[\*](#fn_169)

There was not a Christian Father who could have been ignorant of these
symbols in their physical meaning; for it is in this latter aspect that
they were abandoned to the ignorant rabble. Moreover, they all had as
good reasons to suspect the occult symbolism contained in these images;
although as none of them--Paul excepted, perhaps--had been initiated
they could know nothing whatever about the nature of the final rites.
Any person revealing these mysteries was put to death, regardless of
sex, nationality, or creed. A Christian father would no more be proof
against *an accident* than a Pagan *Mysta* or the Μυστες.

If during the *Aporreta* or preliminary arcanes, there were some
practices which might have shocked the pudicity of a Christian
convert--though we doubt the sincerity of such statements--their
mystical symbolism was all sufficient to relieve the performance of any
charge of licentiousness. Even the episode of the Matron Baubo--whose
rather eccentric method of consolation was immortalized in the minor
Mysteries--is explained by impartial mystagogues quite naturally.
Ceres-Demeter and her earthly wanderings in search of her daughter are
the euhemerized descriptions of one of the most
metaphysico-psychological subjects ever treated of by human mind. It is
a mask for the transcendent narrative of the initiated seers; the
celestial vision of the freed soul of the initiate of the last hour
describing the process by which the soul that has not yet been
incarnated descends for the first time into matter, "Blessed is he who
hath seen those *common concerns* of the underworld; he knows both the
end of life and its divine origin from Jupiter," says Pindar. Taylor
shows, on the authority of more than one initiate, that the "dramatic
performances of the Lesser Mysteries were designed by their founders, to
signify *occultly* the condition of the unpurified soul invested with an
earthly body, and enveloped in a material and physical

###### <span id="page_112">p. 112</span>

nature . . . that the soul, indeed, till purified by philosophy, suffers
death through its union with the body."

The body is the sepulchre, the prison of the soul, and many Christian
Fathers held with Plato that the soul is *punished* through its union
with the body. Such is the fundamental doctrine of the Buddhists and of
many Brahmanists too. When Plotinus remarks that "when the soul has
descended into generation (from its *half*-divine condition) she
partakes of evil, and is carried a great way into a state the opposite
of her first purity and integrity, to be entirely merged in which is
nothing more than to fall into dark mire"; <span
id="fr_170"></span>[\*](#fn_170) he only repeats the teachings of
Gautama-Buddha. If we have to believe the ancient initiates at all, we
must accept their interpretation of the symbols. And if, moreover, we
find them perfectly coinciding with the teachings of the greatest
philosophers and that which we know symbolizes the same meaning in the
modern Mysteries in the East, we must believe them to be right.

If Demeter was considered the intellectual soul, or rather the *Astral*
soul, half emanation from the spirit and half tainted with matter
through a succession of spiritual evolutions--we may readily understand
what is meant by the Matron Baubo, the Enchantress, who before she
succeeds in reconciling the soul--Demeter, to its new position, finds
herself obliged to assume the sexual forms of an infant. Baubo is
*matter,* the physical body; and the intellectual, as yet pure astral
soul can be ensnared into its new terrestrial prison but by the display
of innocent babyhood. Until then, doomed to her fate, Demeter, or
*Magna-mater,* the Soul, wonders and hesitates and suffers; but once
having partaken of the magic potion prepared by Baubo, she forgets her
sorrows; for a certain time she parts with that consciousness of higher
intellect that she was possessed of before entering the body of a child.
Thenceforth she must seek to rejoin it again; and when the age of reason
arrives for the child, the struggle--forgotten for a few years of
infancy--begins again. The astral soul is placed between matter (body)
and the highest intellect (its immortal spirit or *nous*). Which of
those two will conquer? The result of the battle of life lies between
the triad. It is a question of a few years of physical enjoyment on
earth and--if it has begotten abuse--of the dissolution of the earthly
body being followed by death of the astral body, which thus is prevented
from being united with the highest spirit of the triad, which alone
confers on us individual immortality; or, on the other hand, of becoming
immortal mystae; initiated before death of the body into the divine
truths of the after life. Demi-gods below, and GODS above.

###### <span id="page_113">p. 113</span>

Such was the chief object of the Mysteries represented as diabolical by
theology, and ridiculed by modern symbologists. To disbelieve that there
exist in man certain arcane powers, which, by psychological study he can
develop in himself to the highest degree, become an hierophant and then
impart to others under the same conditions of earthly discipline, is to
cast an imputation of falsehood and lunacy upon a number of the best,
purest, and most learned men of antiquity and of the middle ages. What
the hierophant was allowed to see at the last hour is hardly hinted at
by them. And yet Pythagoras, Plato, Plotinus, Iamblichus, Proclus, and
many others knew and affirmed their reality.

Whether in the "inner temple," or through the study of theurgy carried
on privately, or by the sole exertion of a whole life of spiritual
labor, they all obtained the practical proof of such divine
possibilities for man fighting his battle with life on earth to win a
life in the eternity. What the last *epopteia* was is alluded to by
Plato in *Phaedrus* (64); ". . . being initiated in those *Mysteries,*
which it is lawful to call the most blessed of all mysteries . . . we
were freed from the molestations of evils which otherwise await us in a
future period of time. Likewise, in consequence of this divine
*initiation,* we became *spectators* of entire, simple, immovable, and
*blessed visions,* resident in a pure light." This sentence shows that
they saw *visions,* gods, spirits. As Taylor correctly observes, from
all such passages in the works of the initiates it may be inferred,
"that the most sublime part of the *epopteia* . . . consisted in
beholding the gods themselves invested with a resplendent light," or
highest planetary spirits. The statement of Proclus upon this subject is
unequivocal: "In all the initiations and mysteries, the gods exhibit
many forms of themselves, and appear in *a variety of shapes,* and
sometimes, indeed, a formless light of themselves is held forth to the
view; sometimes this light is according *to a human form,* and sometimes
it proceeds into a different shape." <span

"Whatever is *on earth is the resemblance and* SHADOW *of something that
is in the sphere,* while that resplendent thing (the prototype of the
soul-spirit) remaineth in *unchangeable* condition, it is well also with
its shadow. But when the *resplendent one* removeth far from its shadow
life removeth from the latter to a distance. And yet, that very light is
the shadow of something still more resplendent than itself." Thus speaks
*Desatir,* the Persian *Book of Shet, <span
id="fr_172"></span>[\*\*](#fn_172)* thereby showing its identity of
esoteric doctrines with those of the Greek philosophers.

The second statement of Plato confirms our belief that the Mysteries of
the ancients were identical with the Initiations, as practiced now

###### <span id="page_114">p. 114</span>

among the Buddhists and the Hindu adepts. The highest visions, the *most
truthful,* are produced, not through *natural* ecstatics or "mediums,"
as it is sometimes erroneously asserted, but through a regular
discipline of gradual initiations and development of psychical powers.
The Mystae were brought into close union with those whom Proclus calls
"mystical natures," "resplendent gods," because, as Plato says, "we were
ourselves pure and immaculate, being liberated from this *surrounding
vestment,* which we denominate body, and to which we are now bound like
an oyster to its shell." <span id="fr_173"></span>[\*](#fn_173)

So the doctrine of planetary and terrestrial Pitris was revealed
*entirely* in ancient India, as well as now, only at the last moment of
initiation, and to the adepts of superior degrees. Many are the fakirs,
who, though pure, and honest, and self-devoted, have yet never seen the
astral form of a purely *human pitar* (an ancestor or father), otherwise
than at the solemn moment of their first and last initiation. It is in
the presence of his instructor, the guru, and just before the
*vatou*-fakir is dispatched into the world of the living, with his
seven-knotted bamboo wand for all protection, that he is suddenly placed
face to face with the unknown PRESENCE. He sees it, and falls prostrate
at the feet of the evanescent form, but is not entrusted with the great
secret of its evocation; for it is the supreme mystery of the holy
syllable. The **A**UM contains the evocation of the Vedic triad, the
*Trimurti* Brahma, Vishnu, Siva, say the Orientalists; <span
id="fr_174"></span>[\*\*](#fn_174) it contains the evocation of
*something more real and objective than this triune abstraction--*we
say, respectfully contradicting the eminent scientists. It is the
trinity of man himself, on his way to become immortal through the solemn
union of his inner triune SELF--the exterior, gross body, the husk not
even being taken in consideration in this human trinity. <span
id="fr_175"></span>[\*\*\*](#fn_175) It is, when this trinity, in
anticipation of the final

<span id="page_115">p. 115</span>WITH.

triumphant reunion beyond the gates of corporeal death became for a few
seconds a UNITY, that the candidate is allowed, at the moment of the
initiation, to behold his future self. Thus we read in the Persian
*Desatir,* of the "Resplendent one"; in the Greek philosopher-initiates,
of the Augoeides--the self-shining "blessed vision resident in the pure
light"; in Porphyry, that Plotinus was united to his "god" six times
during his lifetime; and so on.

"In ancient India, the mystery of the triad, known but to the initiates,
could not, under the penalty of death, be revealed to the vulgar," says
Vrihaspati.

Neither could it in the ancient Grecian and Samothracian Mysteries. *Nor
can it be now.* It is in the hands of the adepts, and must remain a
mystery to the world so long as the materialistic savant regards it as
an undemonstrated fallacy, an insane hallucination, and the dogmatic
theologian, a snare of the Evil One.

Subjective communication with the human, god-like spirits of those who
have preceded us to the silent land of bliss, is in India divided into
three categories. Under the spiritual training of a guru or sannyasi,
the vatou (disciple or neophyte) begins *to feel* them. Were he not
under the immediate guidance of an adept, he would be controlled by the
invisibles, and utterly at their mercy, for among these subjective
influences he is unable to discern the good from the bad. Happy the
sensitive who is sure of the purity of his spiritual atmosphere!

To this subjective consciousness, which is the *first* degree, is, after
a time, added that of clairaudience. This is the *second* degree or
stage of development. The sensitive--when not naturally made so by
psychological training--now audibly hears, but is still unable to
discern; and is incapable of verifying his impressions, and one who is
unprotected the tricky powers of the air but too often delude with
semblances of voices and speech. But the guru's influence is there; it
is the most powerful shield against the intrusion of the *bhutna* into
the atmosphere of the vatou, consecrated to the pure, human, and
celestial Pitris.

The *third* degree is that when the fakir or any other candidate both
feels, hears, and sees; and when he can at will produce the
*reflections* of the Pitris on the mirror of astral light. All depends
upon his psychological and mesmeric powers, which are always
proportionate to the intensity of his *will*. But the fakir will never
control the Akasa, the spiritual life-principle, the omnipotent agent of
every phenomenon, in the same degree as an adept of the third and
highest initiation. And the

###### <span id="page_116">p. 116</span>

phenomena produced by the will of the latter do not generally run the
market-places for the satisfaction of open-mouthed investigators.

The unity of God, the immortality of the spirit, belief in salvation
only through our works, merit and demerit; such are the principal
articles of faith of the Wisdom-religion, and the ground-work of
Vedaism, Buddhism, Parsism, and such we find to have been even that of
the ancient Osirism, when we, after abandoning the popular sun-god to
the materialism of the rabble, confine our attention to the *Books of
Hermes,* the thrice-great.

"The THOUGHT concealed as yet the world in silence and darkness. . . .
Then the Lord who exists through Himself, and *who is not to be divulged
to the external senses of man;* dissipated darkness, and manifested the
perceptible world."

"He that can be perceived only by the spirit, that escapes the organs of
sense, who is without visible parts, eternal, the soul of all beings,
that none can comprehend, displayed His own splendor" *(Manu,* book i.,
slokas, 6-7).

Such is the ideal of the Supreme in the mind of every Hindu philosopher.

"Of all the duties, the principal one is to acquire the knowledge of the
supreme soul (the spirit); it is the first of all sciences, *for it
alone confers on man immortality*" (*Manu,* book xii., sloka 85).

And our scientists talk of the Nirvana of Buddha and the Moksha of
Brahma as of a complete annihilation! It is thus that the following
verse is interpreted by some materialists.

"The man who recognizes the *Supreme Soul,* in his own soul, as well as
in that of all creatures, and who is equally just to all (whether man or
animals) obtains the happiest of all fates, that to be finally
*absorbed* in the bosom of Brahma" (*Manu,* book xii., sloka 125).

The doctrine of the Moksha and the Nirvana, as understood by the school
of Max Muller, can never bear confronting with numerous texts that can
be found, if required, as a final refutation. There are sculptures in
many pagodas which contradict, point-blank, the imputation. Ask a
Brahman to explain Moksha, address yourself to an educated Buddhist and
pray him to define for you the meaning of Nirvana. Both will answer you
that in every one of these religions Nirvana represents the dogma of the
spirit's immortality. That, to reach the Nirvana means absorption into
the great universal soul, the latter representing a *state,* not an
individual being or an anthropomorphic god, as some understand the great
EXISTENCE. That a spirit reaching such a state becomes a *part* of the
integral *whole*, but never loses its individuality for all that.
Henceforth, the spirit lives spiritually, without any fear of further
modi-

###### <span id="page_117">p. 117</span>

fications of form; for form pertains to matter, and the state of
*Nirvana* implies a complete purification or a final riddance from even
the most sublimated particle of matter.

This word, *absorbed,* when it is proved that the Hindus and Buddhists
believe in the *immortality* of the spirit, must necessarily mean
intimate union, not annihilation. Let Christians call them idolaters, if
they still dare do so, in the face of science and the latest
translations of the sacred Sanscrit books; they have no right to present
the speculative philosophy of ancient sages as an inconsistency and the
philosophers themselves as illogical fools. With far better reason we
can accuse the ancient Jews of utter *nihilism.* There is not a word
contained in the Books of Moses--or the prophets either--which, taken
literally, implies the spirit's immortality. Yet every devout Jew hopes
as well to be "gathered into the bosom of A-Braham."

The hierophants and some Brahmans are accused of having administered to
their epoptai strong drinks or anaesthetics to produce visions which
shall be taken by the latter as realities. They did and do use sacred
beverages which, like the Soma-drink, possess the faculty of freeing the
astral form from the bonds of matter; but in those visions there is as
little to be attributed to hallucination as in the glimpses which the
scientist, by the help of his optical instrument, gets into the
microscopic world. A man cannot perceive, touch, and converse with pure
spirit through any of his bodily senses. Only spirit alone can talk to
and see spirit; and even our astral soul, the *Doppelganger,* is too
gross, too much tainted yet with earthly matter to trust entirely to its
perceptions and insinuations.

How dangerous may often become *untrained* mediumship, and how
thoroughly it was understood and provided against by the ancient sages,
is perfectly exemplified in the case of Socrates. The old Grecian
philosopher was a "medium"; hence, he had never been initiated into the
Mysteries; for such was the rigorous law. But he had his "familiar
spirit" as they call it, his *daimonion;* and this invisible counsellor
became the cause of his death. It is generally believed that if he was
not initiated into the Mysteries it was because he himself neglected to
become so. But the *Secret Records* teach us that it was because he
could not be admitted to participate in the sacred rites, and precisely,
as we state, on account of his mediumship. There was a law against the
admission not only of such as were convicted of deliberate
*witchcraft* <span id="fr_176"></span>[\*](#fn_176) but even

<span id="page_118">p. 118</span>

but even of those who were known to have "a familiar spirit." The law
was just and logical, because a genuine medium is more or less
irresponsible; and the eccentricities of Socrates are thus accounted for
in some degree. A medium must be *passive;* and if a firm believer in
his "spirit-guide" he will allow himself to be ruled by the latter, not
by the rules of the sanctuary. A *medium* of olden times, like the
modern "medium" was subject to be *entranced* at the will and pleasure
of the "power" which *controlled* him; therefore, he could not well have
been entrusted with the awful secrets of the final initiation, "never to
be revealed under the penalty of death." The old sage, in unguarded
moments of "spiritual inspiration," revealed that which he had never
learned; and was therefore put to death as an atheist.

How then, with such an instance as that of Socrates, in relation to the
visions and spiritual wonders at the epoptai, of the Inner Temple, can
any one assert that these seers, theurgists, and thaumaturgists were all
"spirit-mediums"? Neither Pythagoras, Plato, nor any of the later more
important Neo-platonists; neither Iamblichus, Longinus, Proclus, nor
Apollonius of Tyana, were ever mediums; for in such case they would not
have been admitted to the Mysteries at all. As Taylor proves--"This
assertion of divine visions in the Mysteries is clearly confirmed by
Plotinus. And in short, that magical evocation formed a part of the
sacerdotal office in them, and that this was universally believed by all
antiquity long before the era of the later Platonists," shows that apart
from natural "mediumship," there has existed, from the beginning of
time, a mysterious science, discussed by many, but known only to a few.

The use of it is a longing toward our only true and real home--the
after-life, and a desire to cling more closely to our parent spirit;
abuse of it is sorcery, witchcraft, *black* magic. Between the two is
placed natural "mediumship"; a soul clothed with imperfect matter, a
ready agent for either the one or the other, and utterly dependent on
its surroundings of life, constitutional heredity--physical as well as
mental--and on the nature of the "spirits" it attracts around itself. A
blessing or a curse, as fate will have it, unless the medium is purified
of earthly dross.

The reason why in every age so little has been generally known of the
mysteries of initiation, is twofold. The first has already been
explained by more than one author, and lies in the terrible penalty
following the least indiscretion. The second, is the superhuman
difficulties and even dangers which the daring candidate of old had to
encounter, and either conquer, or die in the attempt, when, what is
still worse, he did not lose his

###### <span id="page_119">p. 119</span>

reason. There was no real danger to him whose mind had become thoroughly
spiritualized, and so prepared for every terrific sight. He who fully
recognized the power of his immortal spirit, and never doubted for one
moment its omnipotent protection, had naught to fear. But woe to the
candidate in whom the slightest physical fear--sickly child of
matter--made him lose sight and faith in his own invulnerability. He who
was not wholly confident of his moral fitness to accept the burden of
these tremendous secrets was doomed.

The *Talmud* gives the story of the four Tanaim, who are made, in
allegorical terms, to enter into *the garden of delights; i.e*., to be
initiated into the occult and final science.

"According to the teaching of our holy masters the names of the four who
entered the garden of delight, are: Ben Asai, Ben Zoma, Acher, and Rabbi
Akiba. . . .

"Ben Asai looked and--lost his sight.

"Ben Zoma looked and--lost his reason.

"Acher made depredations in the plantation" (mixed up the whole and
failed). "But Akiba, who had entered in peace, came out of it in peace,
for the saint whose name be blessed had said, 'This old man is worthy of
serving us with glory.' "

"The learned commentators of the *Talmud,* the Rabbis of the synagogue,
explain that the *garden of delight,* in which those four personages are
made to enter, is but that mysterious science, the most terrible of
sciences *for weak intellects, which it leads directly to insanity,*"
says A. Franck, in his *Kabbala.* It is not the pure at heart and he who
studies but with a view to perfecting himself and so more easily
acquiring the promised immortality, who need have any fear; but rather
he who makes of the science of sciences a sinful pretext for worldly
motives, who should tremble.

The latter will never withstand the kabalistic evocations of the supreme
initiation.

The licentious performances of the thousand and one early Christian
sects, may be criticised by partial commentators as well as the ancient
Eleusinian and other rites. But why should they incur the blame of the
theologians, the Christians, when their own "Mysteries" of "the divine
incarnation with Joseph, Mary, and the angel" in a sacred *trilogue*
used to be enacted in more than one country, and were famous at one time
in Spain and Southern France? Later, they fell like many other once
secret rites into the hands of the populace. It is but a few years
since, during every Christmas week, Punch-and-Judy-boxes, containing the
above named personages, an additional display of the infant Jesus in his
manger, were carried about the country in Poland and Southern Russia.
They were called *Kaliadovki,* a word the correct etymology of which we
are

###### <span id="page_120">p. 120</span>

unable to give unless it is from the verb *Kaliadovat,* a word that we
as willingly abandon to learned philologists. We have seen this show in
our days of childhood. We remember the three king-Magi represented by
three dolls in powdered wigs and colored tights; and it is from
recollecting the simple, profound veneration depicted on the faces of
the pious audience, that we can the more readily appreciate the honest
and just remark by the editor, in the introduction to the *Eleusinian
Mysteries,* who says: "It is ignorance which leads to profanation. Men
ridicule what they do not properly understand. . . . The undercurrent of
this world is set toward one goal; and inside of human credulity--call
it human weakness, if you please--is a power almost infinite, a holy
faith capable of apprehending the supremest truths of all existence."

If that abstract sentiment called *Christian charity* prevailed in the
Church, we would be well content to leave all this unsaid. We have no
quarrel with Christians whose faith is sincere and whose practice
coincides with their profession. But with an arrogant, dogmatic, and
dishonest clergy, we have nothing to do except to see the ancient
philosophy--antagonized by modern theology in its puny
offspring--Spiritualism--defended and righted so far as we are able, so
that its grandeur and sufficiency may be thoroughly displayed. It is not
alone for the esoteric philosophy that we fight; nor for any modern
system of moral philosophy, but for the inalienable right of private
judgment, and especially for the ennobling idea of a future life of
activity and accountability.

We eagerly applaud such commentators as Godfrey Higgins, Inman, Payne
Knight, King, Dunlap, and Dr. Newton, however much they disagree with
our own mystical views, for their diligence is constantly being rewarded
by fresh discoveries of the Pagan paternity of Christian symbols. But
otherwise, all these learned works are useless. Their researches only
cover half the ground. Lacking the true key of interpretation they see
the symbols only in a physical aspect. They have no password to cause
the gates of mystery to swing open; and ancient spiritual philosophy is
to them a closed book. Diametrically opposed though they be to the
clergy in their ideas respecting it, in the way of interpretation they
do little more than their opponents for a questioning public. Their
labors tend to strengthen materialism as those of the clergy, especially
the Romish clergy, do to cultivate belief in diabolism.

If the study of Hermetic philosophy held out no other hope of reward, it
would be more than enough to know that by it we may learn with what
perfection of justice the world is governed. A sermon upon this text is
preached by every page of history. Among all there is not one that
conveys a deeper moral than the case of the Roman Church. The divine law
of compensation was never more strikingly exemplified than in the

###### <span id="page_121">p. 121</span>

fact that by her own act she has deprived herself of the only possible
key to her own religious mysteries. The assumption of Godfrey Higgins
that there are two doctrines maintained in the Roman Church, one for the
masses and the other--the esoteric--for the "perfect," or the initiates,
as in the ancient Mysteries, appears to us unwarranted and rather
fantastic. They have lost the key, we repeat; otherwise no terrestrial
power could have prostrated her, and except a superficial knowledge of
the means of producing "miracles," her clergy can in no way be compared
in their wisdom with the hierophants of old.

In burning the works of the theurgists; in proscribing those who affect
their study; in affixing the stigma of demonolatry to magic in general,
Rome has left her exoteric worship and *Bible* to be helplessly riddled
by every free-thinker, her sexual emblems to be identified with
coarseness, and her priests to unwittingly turn magicians and even
sorcerers in their exorcisms, which are but necromantic evocations. Thus
retribution, by the exquisite adjustment of divine law, is made to
overtake this scheme of cruelty, injustice, and bigotry, through her own
suicidal acts.

True philosophy and divine truth are convertible terms. A religion which
dreads the light cannot be a religion based on either truth or
philosophy--hence, it must be false. The ancient Mysteries were
mysteries to the profane only, whom the hierophant never sought nor
would accept as proselytes; to the initiates the Mysteries became
explained as soon as the final veil was withdrawn. No mind like that of
Pythagoras or Plato would have contented itself with an unfathomable and
incomprehensible mystery, like that of the Christian dogma. There can be
but one truth, for two small truths on the same subject can but
constitute one great error. Among thousands of exoteric or popular
conflicting religions which have been propagated since the days when the
first men were enabled to interchange their ideas, not a nation, not a
people, nor the most abject tribe, but after their own fashion has
believed in an Unseen God, the First Cause of unerring and immutable
laws, and in the immortality of our spirit. No creed, no false
philosophy, no religious exaggerations, could ever destroy that feeling.
It must, therefore, be based upon an absolute truth. On the other hand,
every one of the numberless religions and religious sects views the
Deity after its own fashion; and, fathering on the unknown its own
speculations, it enforces these purely human outgrowths of overheated
imagination on the ignorant masses, and calls them "revelation." As the
dogmas of every religion and sect often differ radically, they cannot be
*true.* And if untrue, what are they?

"The greatest curse to a nation," remarks Dr. Inman, "is not *a bad
religion,* but a form of faith which prevents manly inquiry. I know of
no nation of old that was priest-ridden which did not fall under the
swords

###### <span id="page_122">p. 122</span>

of those who did not care for hierarchs. . . . The greatest danger is to
be feared from those ecclesiastics who wink at vice, and encourage it as
a means whereby they can gain power over their votaries. So long as
every man does to other men as he would that they should do to him, and
*allows no one to interfere between him and his Maker,* all will go well
with the world." <span id="fr_177"></span>[\*](#fn_177)

<span id="fn_93"></span>[68:\*](iu101.htm#fr_93) A correspondent of the
London "Times" describes the Catalonian exorcist in the following lines:

"About the 14th of October it was privately announced that a young woman
of seventeen or eighteen years of age, of the lower class, having long
been afflicted with 'a hatred of holy things,' the senior priest of the
Church of the Holy Spirit would cure her of her disease. The exhibition
was to be held in a church frequented by the best part of the community.
The church was dark, but a sickly light was shed by wax lights on the
sable forms of some eighty or a hundred persons who clustered round the
*presbyterio,* or sanctuary, in front of the altar. Within the little
enclosure or sanctuary, separated from the crowd by a light railing,
lay, on a common bench, with a little pillow for her head to recline
upon, a poorly-clad girl, probably of the peasant or artisan class; her
brother or husband stood at her feet to restrain her (at times) frantic
kicking by holding her legs. The door of the vestry opened; the
exhibitor--I mean the priest--came in. The poor girl, not without just
reason, 'had an aversion to holy things,' or, at least, the 400 devils
within her distorted body had such an aversion, and in the confusion of
the moment, thinking that the father was 'a holy thing,' she doubled up
her legs, screamed out with twitching mouth, her whole body writhing,
and threw herself nearly off the bench. The male attendant seized her
legs, the women supported her head and swept out her dishevelled hair.
The priest advanced and, mingling familiarly with the shuddering and
horror-struck crowd, said, pointing at the suffering child, now sobbing
and twitching on the bench, 'Promise me, my children, that you will be
prudent (*prudentes*), and of a truth, sons and daughters mine, you
shall see marvels.' The promise was given. The exhibitor went to procure
stole and short surplice (*estola y roquete*), and returned in a moment,
taking his stand at the side of the 'possessed with the devils,' with
his face toward the group of students. The order of the day's
proceedings was a lecture to the bystanders, and the operation of
exorcising the devils. 'You know,' said the priest, 'that so great is
this girl's aversion to holy things, myself included, that she goes into
convulsions, kicks, screams, and distorts her body the moment she
arrives at the corner of this street, and her convulsive struggles reach
their climax when she enters the sacred house of the Most High.' Turning
to the prostrate, shuddering, most unhappy object of his attack, the
priest commenced: 'In the name of <span id="page_69">p. 69</span> God,
of the saints, of the blessed Host, of every holy sacrament of our
Church, I adjure thee, Rusbel, come out of her.' (N. B. 'Rusbel' is the
name of a devil, the devil having 257 names in Catalonia.) Thus adjured,
the girl threw herself--in an agony of convulsion, till her distorted
face, foam-bespattered lips and writhing limbs grew well-nigh stiff--at
full length upon the floor, and, in language semi-obscene, semi-violent,
screamed out, 'I don't choose to come out, you thieves, scamps,
robbers.' At last, from the quivering lips of the girl, came the words,
'I will'; but the devil added, with traditional perversity, 'I will cast
the 100 out, but by the mouth of the girl.' The priest objected. The
exit, he said, of 100 devils out of the small Spanish mouth of the woman
would 'leave her suffocated.' Then the maddened girl said she must
undress herself for the devils to escape. This petition the holy father
refused. 'Then I will come out through the right foot, but first'--the
girl had on a hempen sandal, she was obviously of the poorest
class--'you must take off her sandal.' The sandal was untied; the foot
gave a convulsive plunge; the devil and his myrmidons (so the *cura*
said, looking round triumphantly) had gone to their own place. And,
assured of this, the wretched dupe of a girl lay quite still. The bishop
was not cognizant of this freak of the clergy, and the moment it came to
the ears of the civil authorities, the sharpest means were taken to
prevent a repetition of the scandal."

*true religion* the world shall at last understand the adoration of one
Supreme, invisible, and Unknown Deity, by works and acts, not by the
profession of vain human dogmas. But our intention is to go farther. We
desire to demonstrate that if we exclude ceremonial and fetish worship
from being regarded as essential parts of religion, then the true
Christ-like principles have been exemplified, and true Christianity
practiced since the days of the apostles, exclusively among Buddhists
and "heathen."

should the Roman Catholics object to the claims of the Spiritualists?
If, without proof, they believe in the "materialization" of Mary and
John, for Ignatius, how can they logically deny the materialization of
Katie and John (King), when it is attested by the careful experiments of
Mr. Crookes, the English chemist, and the cumulative testimony of a
large number of witnesses?

<span id="fn_133"></span>[91:\*](iu101.htm#fr_133) In its most extensive
meaning, the Sanscrit word has the same literal sense as the Greek term;
both imply "revelation," by no human agent, but through the "receiving
of the sacred drink." In India the initiated received the "Soma," sacred
drink, which helped to liberate his soul from the body; and in the
Eleusinian Mysteries it was the sacred drink offered at the Epopteia.
The Grecian Mysteries are wholly derived from the Brahmanical Vedic
rites, and the latter from the ante-vedic religious Mysteries--primitive
Buddhist philosophy.

<span id="fn_134"></span>[91:\*\*](iu101.htm#fr_134) It is needless to
state that *the Gospel according to John* was not written by John but by
a Platonist or a Gnostic belonging to the Neo-platonic school.

<span id="fn_135"></span>[91:\*\*\*](iu101.htm#fr_135) The fact that
Peter persecuted the "Apostle to the Gentiles," under that name, does
not necessarily imply that there was no Simon Magus individually
distinct from Paul. It may have become a generic name of abuse.
Theodoret and Chrysostom, the earliest and most prolific commentators on
the Gnosticism of those days, seem actually to make of Simon a rival of
Paul, and to state that between them passed frequent messages. The
former, as a diligent propagandist of what Paul terms the "antitheses of
the Gnosis" (1st Epistle to Timothy), must have been a sore thorn in the
side of the apostle. There are sufficient proofs of the actual existence
of Simon Magus.

must not be understood literally; for as in the initiation of certain
Brotherhoods it has a secret meaning, hinted at by Pythagoras, when he

life"--in Hindu, *a-bi-hayat*, fount of life.

<span id="fn_156"></span>[102:\*](iu101.htm#fr_156) This original and
very long sermon was preached in a church at Brooklyn, N. Y., on the
15th day of April, 1877. On the following morning, the reverend orator
was called in the "Sun" a gibbering charlatan; but this deserved epithet
will not prevent other reverend buffoons doing the same and even worse.
And this is the religion of Christ! Far better disbelieve in him
altogether than caricature one's God in such a manner. We heartily
applaud the "Sun" for the following views: "And then when Talmage makes
Christ say to Martha in the tantrums: 'Don't worry, but sit down on this
ottoman,' he adds the climax to a scene that the inspired writers had
nothing to say about. Talmage's buffoonery is going too far. If he were
the worst heretic in the land, instead of being straight in his
orthodoxy, he would not do so much evil to religion as he does by his
familiar blasphemies."

"The book in question," says the author, "contains numerous figures, all
resembling closely the Mesopotamian emblem of *Ishtar.* The presence of
the woman *therein* identifies the two as symbolic of Isis, or *la
nature;* and a man bowing down in adoration thereof shows the same idea
as is depicted in Assyrian sculptures, where males offer to the goddess
*symbols* of *themselves*" (See "Ancient Pagan and Modern Christian

which properly belongs to it. Witchcraft may be either conscious or
unconscious. Certain wicked and dangerous results may be obtained
through the mesmeric powers of a so-called sorcerer, who misuses his
potential fluid; or again they may be achieved through an easy access of
malicious tricky "spirits" (so much the worse if <span

atmosphere surrounding a medium. How many thousands of such
irresponsible innocent victims have met infamous deaths through the
tricks of those Elementaries!
