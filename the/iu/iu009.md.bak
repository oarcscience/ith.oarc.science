FROM the moment when the foetal embryo is formed until the old man,
gasping his last, drops into the grave, neither the beginning nor the
end is understood by scholastic science; all before us is a blank, all
after us chaos. For it there is no evidence as to the relations between
spirit, soul, and body, either before or after death. The mere
life-principle itself presents an unsolvable enigma, upon the study of
which materialism has vainly exhausted its intellectual powers. In the
presence of a corpse the skeptical physiologist stands dumb when asked
by his pupil whence came the former tenant of that empty box, and
whither it has gone. The pupil must either, like his master, rest
satisfied with the explanation that protoplasm made the man, and force
vitalized and will now consume his body, or he must go outside the walls
of his college and the books of its library to find an explanation of
the mystery.

It is sometimes as interesting as instructive to follow the two great
rivals, science and theology, in their frequent skirmishes. Not all of
the sons of the Church are as unsuccessful in their attempts at advocacy
as the poor Abbe Moigno, of Paris. This respectable, and no doubt
well-meaning divine, in his fruitless attempt to refute the
free-thinking arguments of Huxley, Tyndall, Du Bois-Raymond, and many
others, has met with a sad failure. In his antidotal arguments his
success was more than doubtful, and, as a reward for his trouble, the
"Congregation of the Index" forbids the circulation of his book among
the faithful.

It is a dangerous experiment to engage in a single-handed duel with
scientists on topics which are well demonstrated by experimental
research. In what they do *know* they are unassailable, and until the
old formula is destroyed by their own hands and replaced by a more
newly-discovered one, there is no use fighting against Achilles--unless,
indeed, one is for-

###### <span id="page_337">p. 337</span>

tunate enough to catch the swift-footed god by his vulnerable heel. This
heel is--what they confess they do not know!

That was a cunning device to which a certain well-known preacher
resorted to reach this mortal part. Before we proceed to narrate the
extraordinary though well authenticated facts with which we intend to
fill this chapter, it will be good policy to show once more how fallible
is modern science as to every fact in nature which can be tested neither
by retort nor crucible. The following are a few fragments from a series
of sermons by F. Felix, of Notre Dame, entitled *Mystery and Science.*
They are worthy to be translated for and quoted in a work which is
undertaken in precisely the same spirit as that exhibited by the
preacher. For once the Church silenced for a time the arrogance of her
traditional enemy, in the face of the learned academicians.

It was known that the great preacher, in response to the general desire
of the faithful, and perhaps to the orders of ecclesiastical superiors,
had been preparing himself for a great oratorical effort, and the
historic cathedral was filled with a monster congregation. Amid a
profound silence he began his discourse, of which the following
paragraphs are sufficient for our purpose:

"A portentous word has been pronounced against us to confront progress
with Christianity--SCIENCE. Such is the formidable evocation with which
they try to appall us. To all that we can say to base progress upon
Christianity, they have always a ready response: that is not
*scientific.* We say revelation; revelation is not scientific. We say
miracle; a miracle is not scientific.

"Thus antichristianism, faithful to its tradition, and now more than
ever, pretends to kill us by science. Principle *of darkness,* it
threatens us with light. It proclaims itself the light. . . .

"A hundred times I asked myself, What is, then, that terrible science
which is making ready to devour us? . . . Is it mathematical science? .
. . but we also have our mathematicians. Is it physics? Astronomy?
Physiology? Geology? But we number in Catholicism astronomers,
physicists, geologists, <span id="fr_498"></span>[\*](#fn_497.md) and
physiologists, who make somewhat of a figure in the scientific world,
who have their place in the Academy and their name in history. It would
appear that what is to crush us is neither this nor that science, but
science in general.

"And why do they prophesy the overthrow of Christianity by science?
Listen: . . . we must perish by science because we teach mysteries, and
because the Christian mysteries are in radical antagonism with modern

<span id="page_338">p. 338</span>

science. . . . Mystery is the negation of common sense; science repels
it; science condemns it; she has spoken--Anathema!

"Ah! you are right; if Christian mystery is what you proclaim it, then
in the name of science hurl the anathema at it. Nothing is antipathetic
to science like the absurd and contradictory. But, glory be to the
truth! such is not the mystery of Christianity. If it were so, it would
remain for you to explain the most inexplicable of mysteries: how comes
it that, during nearly 2,000 years, so many superior minds and rare
geniuses have embraced our mysteries, without thinking to repudiate
science or abdicate reason? <span id="fr_499"></span>[\*](#fn_498.md) Talk
as much as you like of your modern science, modern thought, and modern
genius, there were scientists before 1789.

"If our mysteries are so manifestly absurd and contradictory, how is it
that such mighty geniuses should have accepted them without a single
doubt? . . . But God preserve me from insisting upon demonstrating that
mystery implies no contradiction with science! . . . Of what use to
prove, by metaphysical abstractions, that science can reconcile itself
with mystery, when all the realities of creation show unanswerably that
mystery everywhere baffles science? You ask that we should show you,
beyond doubt, that exact science cannot admit mystery; I answer you
decidedly that she cannot escape it. Mystery is the FATALITY of science.

"Shall we choose our proofs? First, then, look around at the purely
material world, from the smallest atom to the most majestic sun. There,
if you try to embrace in the unity of a single law all these bodies and
their movements, if you seek the word which explains, in this vast
panorama of the universe, this prodigious harmony, where all seems to
obey the empire of a single force, you pronounce a word to express it,
and say *Attraction*! . . . Yes, attraction, this is the sublime epitome
of the science of the heavenly bodies. You say that throughout space
these bodies recognize and attract each other; you say that they attract
in proportion to their mass, and in inverse ratio with the squares of
their distances. And, in fact, until the present moment, nothing has
happened to give the lie to this assertion, but everything has confirmed
a formula which now reigns sovereign in the EMPIRE OF HYPOTHESIS, and
therefore it must henceforth enjoy the glory of being an invincible
truism.

"Gentlemen, with all my heart I make my scientific obeisances to the
sovereignty of attraction. It is not I who would desire to obscure a
light in the world of matter which reflects upon the world of spirits.
The

###### <span id="page_339">p. 339</span>

empire of attraction, then, is palpable; it is sovereign; it stares us
in the face!

"But, what is this attraction? who has seen attraction? who has met
attraction? who has touched attraction? How do these mute bodies,
*intelligent,* insensible, exercise upon each other unconsciously this
reciprocity of action and reaction which holds them in a common
equilibrium and unanimous harmony? *Is this force* which draws sun to
sun, and atom to atom, an invisible mediator which goes from one to
another? And, in such case what is this mediator? whence comes to itself
this force which mediates, and this power which embraces, from which the
sun can no more escape than the atom. But is this force nothing
different from the elements themselves which attract each other? . . .
Mystery! Mystery!

"Yes, gentlemen, this attraction which shines with such brightness
throughout the material world, remains to you at bottom an impenetrable
mystery. . . . Well! because of its mystery, will you deny its reality,
which touches you, and its domination, which subjugates you? . . . And
again, remark if you please, mystery is so much at the foundation of all
science that if you should desire to exclude mystery, you would be
compelled to suppress science itself. *Imagine whatever science you
will,* follow the magnificent sweep of its deductions . . . when you
arrive at its parent source, you come face to face with the
*unknown*. <span id="fr_500"></span>[\*](#fn_499.md)

"Who has been able to penetrate the secret of the formation of a body,
the generation of a single atom? What is there I will not say at the
centre of a sun, but at the centre of an atom? who has sounded to the
bottom the abyss in a grain of sand? The grain of sand, gentlemen, has
been studied four thousand years by science, she has turned and returned
it; she divides it and subdivides it; she torments it with her
experiments; she vexes it with her questions to snatch from it the final
word as to its secret constitution; she asks it, with an insatiable
curiosity: 'Shall I divide thee infinitesimally?' Then, suspended over
this abyss, science hesitates, she stumbles, she feels dazzled, she
becomes dizzy, and, in despair says: **I** DO NOT KNOW!

"But if you are so fatally ignorant of the genesis and hidden nature of
a grain of sand, how should you have an intuition as to the generation
of a single living being? Whence in the living being does life come?
Where does it commence? What is the life-principle?" <span
id="fr_501"></span>[\*\*](#fn_500.md)

###### <span id="page_340">p. 340</span>

Can the scientists answer the eloquent monk? Can they escape from his
pitiless logic? Mystery certainly does bound them on every side; and the
*Ultima Thule,* whether of Herbert Spencer, Tyndall, or Huxley, has
written upon the closed portals the words **I**NCOMPREHENSIBLE,
**U**NKNOWABLE. For the lover of metaphor, science may be likened to a
twinkling star shining with resplendent brightness through rifts in a
bank of densely-black clouds. If her votaries cannot define that
mysterious attraction which draws into concrete masses the material
particles which form the smallest pebble on the ocean-beach, how can
they define the limits at which the possible stops and the impossible
begins?

Why should there be an attraction between the molecules of matter, and
none between those of spirit? If, out of the material portion of the
ether, by virtue of the inherent restlessness of its particles, the
forms of worlds and their species of plants and animals can be evolved,
why, out of the spiritual part of the ether, should not successive races
of beings, from the stage of monad to that of man, be developed; each
lower form unfolding a higher one until the work of evolution is
completed on our earth, in the production of immortal man? It will be
seen that, for the moment, we entirely put aside the accumulated facts
which prove the case, and submit it to the arbitrament of logic.

By whatsoever name the physicists may call the energizing principle in
matter is of no account; it is a subtile something apart from the matter
itself, and, as it escapes their detection, it must be something besides
matter. If the law of attraction is admitted as governing the one, why
should it be excluded from influencing the other? Leaving logic to
answer, we turn to the common experience of mankind, and there find a
mass of testimony corroborative of the immortality of the soul, if we
judge but from analogies. But we have more than that--we have the
unimpeachable testimony of thousands upon thousands, that there is a
regular science of the soul, which, notwithstanding that it is now
denied the right of a place among other sciences, *is* a science. This
science, by penetrating the arcana of nature far deeper than our modern
philosophy ever dreamed possible, teaches us how to force the
*invisible* to become visible; the existence of elementary spirits; the
nature and magical properties of the astral light; the power of living
men to bring themselves into communication with the former through the
latter. Let them examine the proofs with the lamp of experience, and
neither the Academy nor the Church, for which Father Felix so
persuasively spoke, can deny them.

Modern science is in a dilemma; it must concede our hypothesis to be
correct, or admit the possibility of miracle. To do so, is to say that
there can be an infraction of natural law. If this can happen in one
case,

###### <span id="page_341">p. 341</span>

what assurance have we that it may not be repeated indefinitely, and so
destroy that fixity of law, that perfect balance of forces by which the
universe is governed. This is a very ancient and an unanswerable
argument. To deny the appearance, in our midst, of supersensual beings,
when they have been seen, at various times and in various countries, by
not merely thousands, but millions of persons, is unpardonable
obstinacy; to say that, in any one instance, the apparition has been
produced by a miracle, fatal to the fundamental principle of science.
What will they do? What can they do, when they shall have awakened from
the benumbing stupor of their pride, but collect the facts, and try to
enlarge the boundaries of their field of investigations?

The existence of spirit in the common mediator, the ether, is denied by
materialism; while theology makes of it a personal god, the kabalist
holds that both are wrong, saving that in ether, the elements represent
but matter--the blind cosmic forces of nature; and Spirit, the
intelligence which directs them. The Hermetic, Orphic, and Pythagorean
cosmogonical doctrines, as well as those of Sanchoniathon and Berosus,
are all based upon one irrefutable formula, viz.: that the ether and
chaos, or, in the Platonic language, mind and matter, were the two
primeval and eternal principles of the universe, utterly independent of
anything else. The former was the all-vivifying intellectual principle;
the chaos, a shapeless, liquid principle, without "form or sense," from
the union of which two, sprang into existence the universe, or rather,
the universal world, the first androgynous deity--the chaotic matter
becoming its body, and ether the soul. According to the phraseology of a
*Fragment of Hermias,* "chaos, from this union with spirit, obtaining
*sense,* shone with pleasure, and thus was produced the *Protogonos*
(the first-born) light." <span id="fr_502"></span>[\*](#fn_501.md) This is
the universal trinity, based on the metaphysical conceptions of the
ancients, who, reasoning by analogy, made of man, who is a compound of
intellect and matter, the microcosm of the macrocosm, or great universe.

If we now compare this doctrine with the speculations of science, which
comes to a full stop at the Borderland of the unknown, and, while
incompetent to solve the mystery, will allow no one else to speculate
upon the subject; or, with the great theological dogma, that the world
was called into existence by a heavenly trick of prestidigitation; we do
not hesitate to believe that, in the absence of better proof, the
Hermetic doctrine is by far the more reasonable, highly metaphysical as
it may appear. The universe is there, and we know that we exist; but how
did it come, and how did we appear in it? Denied an answer by the rep-

###### <span id="page_342">p. 342</span>

resentatives of physical learning, and excommunicated and anathematized
for our blasphemous curiosity by the spiritual usurpers, what can we do,
but turn for information to the sages who meditated upon the subject
ages before the molecules of our philosophers aggregated in ethereal
space?

This visible universe of spirit and matter, they say, is but the
concrete image of the ideal abstraction; it was built on the model of
the first divine IDEA. Thus our universe existed from eternity in a
latent state. The soul animating this purely spiritual universe is the
central sun, the highest deity itself. It was not himself who built the
concrete form of his idea, but his first-begotten; and as it was
constructed on the geometrical figure of the dodecahedron, <span
id="fr_503"></span>[\*](#fn_502.md) the first-begotten "was pleased to
employ twelve thousand years in its creation." The latter number is
expressed in the Tyrrhenian cosmogony, <span
id="fr_504"></span>[\*\*](#fn_503.md) which shows man created in the sixth
millennium. This agrees with the Egyptian theory of 6,000 "years," <span
id="fr_505"></span>[\*\*\*](#fn_504.md) and with the Hebrew computation.
Sanchoniathon, <span id="fr_506"></span>[\*\*\*\*](#fn_505.md) in his
*Cosmogony,* declares that when the wind (spirit) became enamored of its
own principles (the chaos), an intimate union took place, which
connection was called *pothos,* and from this sprang the seed of all.
And the chaos knew not its own production, for it was *senseless;* but
from its embrace with the wind was generated mot, or the ilus
(mud). <span id="fr_507"></span>[\*\*\*\*\*](#fn_506.md) From this
proceeded the spores of creation and the generation of the universe.

The ancients, who named but four elements, made of aether a fifth one.
On account of its essence being made divine by the unseen presence it
was considered as a medium between this world and the next. They held
that when the directing intelligences retired from any portion of ether,
one of the four kingdoms which they are bound to superintend, the space
was left in possession of *evil*. An adept who prepared to converse with
the "invisibles," had to know well his ritual, and be perfectly
acquainted with the conditions required for the perfect equilibrium of
the four elements in the astral light. First of all, he must purify the
essence, and within the circle in which he sought to attract the pure
spirits, equilibrize the elements, so as to prevent the ingress of the
elementaries into their respective spheres. But woe to the imprudent
inquirer who ignorantly trespasses upon forbidden ground; danger will
beset him at every step. He evokes powers that he cannot control; he
arouses sentries which allow only their masters to pass. For, in the
words of the immortal Rosicrucian, "Once that thou hast resolved to
become a cooperator with the spirit of

###### <span id="page_343">p. 343</span>

the *living* God, take care not to hinder Him in His work; for, if thy
heat exceeds the natural proportion thou hast stirr'd the wrath of the
*Moyst* <span id="fr_508"></span>[\*](#fn_507.md) *natures,* and they will
stand up against the *central fire,* and the central fire against them,
and there will be a terrible division in the *chaos*." <span
id="fr_509"></span>[\*\*](#fn_508.md) The spirit of harmony and union will
depart from the elements, disturbed by the imprudent hand; and the
currents of blind forces will become immediately infested by numberless
creatures of matter and instinct--the bad daemons of the theurgists, the
devils of theology; the gnomes, salamanders, sylphs, and undines will
assail the rash performer under multifarious aerial forms. Unable to
invent anything, they will search your memory to its very depths; hence
the nervous exhaustion and mental oppression of certain sensitive
natures at spiritual circles. The elementals will bring to light
long-forgotten remembrances of the past; forms, images, sweet mementos,
and familiar sentences, long since faded from our own remembrance, but
vividly preserved in the inscrutable depths of our memory and on the
astral tablets of the imperishable "**B**OOK OF **L**IFE."

Every organized thing in this world, visible as well as invisible, has
an element appropriate to itself. The fish lives and breathes in the
water; the plant consumes carbonic acid, which for animals and men
produces death; some beings are fitted for rarefied strata of air,
others exist only in the densest. Life, to some, is dependent on
sunlight, to others, upon darkness; and so the wise economy of nature
adapts to each existing condition some living form. These analogies
warrant the conclusion that, not only is there no unoccupied portion of
universal nature, but also that for each thing that has life, special
conditions are furnished, and, being furnished, they are necessary. Now,
assuming

###### <span id="page_344">p. 344</span>

that there is an invisible side to the universe, the fixed habit of
nature warrants the conclusion that this half is occupied, like the
other half; and that each group of its occupants is supplied with the
indispensable conditions of existence. It is as illogical to imagine
that identical conditions are furnished to all, as it would be to
maintain such a theory respecting the inhabitants of the domain of
visible nature. That there are spirits implies that there is a diversity
of spirits; for men differ, and human spirits are but disembodied men.

To say that all spirits are alike, or fitted to the same atmosphere, or
possessed of like powers, or governed by the same attractions--electric,
magnetic, odic, astral, it matters not which--is as absurd as though one
should say that all planets have the same nature, or that all animals
are amphibious, or all men can be nourished on the same food. It accords
with reason to suppose that the grossest natures among the spirits will
sink to the lowest depths of the spiritual atmosphere--in other words,
be found nearest to the earth. Inversely, the purest would be farthest
away. In what, were we to coin a word, we should call the *Psychomatics*
of Occultism, it is as unwarrantable to assume that either of these
grades of spirits can occupy the place, or subsist in the conditions, of
the other, as in hydraulics it would be to expect that two liquids of
different densities could exchange their markings on the scale of
Beaume's hydrometer.

Gorres, describing a conversation he had with some Hindus of the Malabar
coast, reports that upon asking them whether they had ghosts among them,
they replied, "Yes, but we know them to be *bad spirits* . . . good ones
can hardly ever appear at all. They are principally the spirits of
*suicides* and *murderers,* or of those who die violent deaths. They
constantly flutter about and appear as phantoms. Night-time is favorable
to them, they seduce the feeble-minded and tempt others in a thousand
different ways." <span id="fr_510"></span>[\*](#fn_509.md)

Porphyry presents to us some hideous facts whose verity is substantiated
in the experience of every student of magic. "The *soul*," <span
id="fr_511"></span>[\*\*](#fn_510.md) says he, "having even after death a
certain affection for its body, an affinity proportioned to the violence
with which their union was broken, we see many spirits hovering in
despair about their earthly remains; we even see them eagerly seeking
the putrid remains of other bodies, but above all freshly-spilled blood,
which seems to impart to them for the moment some of the faculties of
life." <span id="fr_512"></span>[\*\*\*](#fn_511.md)

###### <span id="page_345">p. 345</span>

Let spiritualists who doubt the theurgist, try the effect of about half
a pound of freshly-drawn human blood at their next materializing seance!

"The gods and the angels," says Iamblichus, "appear to us among peace
and harmony; the bad demons, in tossing everything in confusion. . . .
As to the *ordinary souls,* we can perceive them more rarely,
etc." <span id="fr_513"></span>[\*](#fn_512.md)

"The human soul (the astral body) is a demon that our language may name
genius," says Apuleius. <span id="fr_514"></span>[\*\*](#fn_513.md) "She is
an *immortal god,* though in a certain sense she is born at the same
time as the man in whom she is. Consequently, we may say that she dies
in the same way that she is born."

"The soul is born in this world upon leaving *another world* (*anima
mundi*)*,* in which her existence precedes the one we all know (on
earth). Thus, the gods who consider her proceedings in all the phases of
various existences and as a whole, punish her sometimes for sins
committed during an anterior life. She dies when she separates herself
from a body in which she crossed this life as in a frail bark. And this
is, if I mistake not, the secret meaning of the tumulary inscription, so
simple for the initiate: "*To the gods manes who lived.*" But this kind
of death does not annihilate the soul, it only transforms it into a
*lemure.* Lemures are the manes or ghosts, which we know under the name
of lares. When they keep away and *show us a beneficient protection,* we
honor in them the protecting divinities of the family hearth; but, if
their crimes sentence them to err, we call them *larvae.* They become a
plague for the wicked, and the *vain terror* of the good."

This language can hardly be called ambiguous, and yet, the
Reincarnationists quote Apuleius in corroboration of their theory that
man passes through a succession of physical human births upon this
planet, until he is finally purged from the dross of his nature. But
Apuleius distinctly says that we come upon this earth from another one,
where we had an existence, the recollection of which has faded away. As
the watch passes from hand to hand and room to room in a factory, one
part being added here and another there, until the delicate machine is
perfected, according to the design conceived in the mind of the master
before the work was begun; so, according to ancient philosophy, the
first divine conception of man takes shape little by little, in the
several departments of the universal workshop, and the perfect human
being finally appears on our scene.

This philosophy teaches that nature never leaves her work unfinished;

###### <span id="page_346">p. 346</span>

if baffled at the first attempt, she tries again. When she evolves a
human embryo, the intention is that a man shall be
perfected--physically, intellectually, and spiritually. His body is to
grow mature, wear out, and die; his mind unfold, ripen, and be
harmoniously balanced; his divine spirit illuminate and blend easily
with the *inner* man. No human being completes its grand cycle, or the
"circle of necessity," until all these are accomplished. As the laggards
in a race struggle and plod in their first quarter while the victor
darts past the goal, so, in the race of immortality, some souls outspeed
all the rest and reach the end, while their myriad competitors are
toiling under the load of matter, close to the startingpoint. Some
unfortunates fall out entirely, and lose all chance of the prize; some
retrace their steps and begin again. This is what the Hindu dreads above
all things--*transmigration* and *reincarnation;* only on other and
inferior planets, never on this one. But there is a way to avoid it, and
Buddha taught it in his doctrine of poverty, restriction of the senses,
perfect indifference to the objects of this earthly vale of tears,
freedom from passion, and frequent intercommunication with the
Atma--soul-contemplation. The cause of reincarnation is ignorance of our
senses, and the idea that there is any reality in the world, anything
except abstract existence. From the organs of sense comes the
"hallucination" we call contact; "from contact, desire; from desire,
sensation (which also is a deception of our body); from sensation, the
cleaving to existing bodies; from this cleaving, reproduction; and from
reproduction, disease, decay, and death."

Thus, like the revolutions of a wheel, there is a regular succession of
death and birth, the moral cause of which is the cleaving to existing
objects, while the instrumental cause is *karma* (the power which
controls the universe, prompting it to activity), merit and demerit. "It
is, therefore, the great desire of all beings who would be released
*from the sorrows of successive birth,* to seek the destruction of the
moral cause, the cleaving to existing objects, or evil desire." They, in
whom evil desire is entirely destroyed, are called *Arhats*. <span
id="fr_515"></span>[\*](#fn_514.md) Freedom from evil desire insures the
possession of a *miraculous* power. At his death, the Arhat is never
reincarnated; he invariably attains Nirvana--a word, by the bye, falsely
interpreted by the Christian scholars and skeptical commentators.
Nirvana is the world of *cause,* in which all deceptive effects or
delusions of our senses disappear. Nirvana is the highest attainable
sphere. The *pitris* (the pre-Adamic spirits) are considered as
*reincarnated,* by the Buddhistic philosopher, though in a degree far
superior to that of the man of earth. Do they not die in their turn? Do
not their astral bodies

###### <span id="page_347">p. 347</span>

suffer and rejoice, and feel the same curse of illusionary feelings as
when embodied?

What Buddha taught in the sixth century, B.C., in India, Pythagoras
taught in the fifth, in Greece and Italy. Gibbon shows how deeply the
Pharisees were impressed with this belief in the transmigration of
souls. <span id="fr_516"></span>[\*](#fn_515.md) The Egyptian circle of
necessity is ineffaceably stamped on the hoary monuments of old. And
Jesus, when healing the sick, invariably used the following expression:
"Thy sins are forgiven thee." This is a pure Buddhistical doctrine. "The
Jews said to the blind man: Thou wast *altogether born in sins,* and
dost thou teach us? The doctrine of the disciples (of Christ) is
analogous to the 'Merit and Demerit' of the Buddhists; for the sick
recovered, *if their sins were forgiven*." <span
id="fr_517"></span>[\*\*](#fn_516.md) But, this *former life* believed in
by the Buddhists, is not a life *on this* planet, for, more than any
other people, the Buddhistical philosopher appreciated the great
doctrine of cycles.

The speculations of Dupuis, Volney, and Godfrey Higgins on the secret
meaning of the cycles, or the *kalpas* and the yugs of the Brahmans and
Buddhists, amounted to little, as they did not have the key to the
esoteric, spiritual doctrine therein contained. No philosophy ever
speculated on God as an *abstraction,* but considered Him under His
various manifestations. The "First Cause" of the Hebrew Bible, the
Pythagorean "Monad," the "One Existence" of the Hindu philosopher, and
the kabalistic "En-Soph"--the *Boundless--*are identical. The Hindu
Bhagavant does not create; he enters the egg of the world, and emanates
from it as Brahm, in the same manner as the Pythagorean Duad evolves
from the highest and solitary Monas. <span

sopher is the Hindu Monas (mind), "who has no first cause (apurva, or
material cause), nor is liable to destruction." <span
id="fr_519"></span>[\*](#fn_518.md) Brahma, as Prajapati, manifests himself
first of all as "twelve bodies," or attributes, which are represented by
the twelve gods, symbolizing 1, Fire; 2, the Sun; 3, Soma, which gives
omniscience; 4, all living Beings; 5, Vayu, or material Ether; 6, Death,
or breath of destruction--Siva; 7, Earth; 8, Heaven; 9, Agni, the
Immaterial Fire; 10, Aditya, the immaterial and female invisible Sun;
11, Mind; 12, the great Infinite Cycle, "which is not to be
stopped." <span id="fr_520"></span>[\*\*](#fn_519.md) After that, Brahma
dissolves himself into the Visible Universe, every atom of which is
himself. When this is done, the not-manifested, indivisible, and
indefinite Monas retires into the undisturbed and majestic solitude of
its unity. *The* manifested deity, a duad at first, now becomes a triad;
its triune quality emanates incessantly spiritual powers, who become
immortal gods (souls). Each of these souls must be united in its turn
with a human being, and from the moment of its consciousness it
commences a series of births and deaths. An Eastern artist has attempted
to give pictorial expression to the kabalistic doctrine of the cycles.
The picture covers a whole inner wall of a subterranean temple in the
neighborhood of a great Buddhistic pagoda, and is strikingly suggestive.
Let us attempt to convey some idea of the design, as we recall it.

Imagine a given point in space as the primordial one; then with
compasses draw a circle around this point; where the beginning and the
end unite together, emanation and reabsorption meet. The circle itself
is composed of innumerable smaller circles, like the rings of a
bracelet, and each of these minor rings forms the belt of the goddess
which represents that sphere. As the curve of the arc approaches the
ultimate point of the semi-circle--the nadir of the grand cycle--at
which is placed our planet by the mystical painter, the face of each
successive goddess becomes more dark and hideous than European
imagination is able to conceive. Every belt is covered with the
representations of plants, animals, and human beings, belonging to the
fauna, flora, and anthropology of that particular sphere. There is a
certain distance between each of the spheres, purposely marked; for,
after the accomplishment of the circles through

###### <span id="page_349">p. 349</span>

various transmigrations, the soul is allowed a time of temporary
nirvana, during which space of time the atma loses all remembrance of
past sorrows. The intermediate ethereal space is filled with strange
beings. Those between the highest ether and the earth below are the
creatures of a "middle nature"; nature-spirits, or, as the kabalists
term it sometimes, the elementary.

This picture is either a copy of the one described to posterity by
Berosus, the priest of the temple of Belus, at Babylon, or the original.
We leave it to the shrewdness of the modern archaeologist to decide. But
the wall is covered with precisely such creatures as described by the
semi-demon, or half-god, Oannes, the Chaldean man-fish, <span
id="fr_521"></span>[\*](#fn_520.md) " . . . hideous beings, which were
produced of a two-fold principle"--the astral light and the grosser
matter.

Even remains of architectural relics of the earliest races have been
sadly neglected by antiquarians, until now. The caverns of Ajunta, which
are but 200 miles from Bombay, in the Chandor range, and the ruins of
the ancient city of Aurungabad, whose crumbling palaces and curious
tombs have lain in desolate solitude for many centuries, have attracted
attention but very recently. Mementos of long by-gone civilization, they
were allowed to become the shelter of wild beasts for ages before they
were found worthy of a scientific exploration, and it is only recently
that the *Observer* gave an enthusiastic description of these archaic
ancestors of Herculaneum and Pompeii. After justly blaming the local
government which "has provided a bungalow where the traveller may find
shelter and safety, but that is all," it proceeds to narrate the wonders
to be seen in this retired spot, in the following words:

"In a deep glen away up the mountain there is a group of cave-temples
which are the most wonderful caverns on the earth. It is not known at
the present age how many of these exist in the deep recesses of the
mountains; but twenty-seven have been explored, surveyed, and, to some
extent, cleared of rubbish. There are, doubtless, many others. It is
hard to realize with what indefatigable toil these wonderful caves have
been hewn from the solid rock of amygdaloid. They are said to have been
wholly Buddhist in their origin, and were used for purposes of worship
and asceticism. They rank very high as works of art. They extend over
500 feet along a high cliff, and are carved in the most curious manner,
exhibiting, in a wonderful degree, the taste, talent, and persevering
industry of the Hindu sculptors.

###### <span id="page_350">p. 350</span>

"These cave-temples are beautifully cut and carved on the outside; but
inside they were finished most elaborately, and decorated with a vast
profusion of sculptures and paintings. These long-deserted temples have
suffered from dampness and neglect, and the paintings and frescos are
not what they were hundreds of years ago. But the colors are still
brilliant, and scenes gay and festive still appear upon the walls. Some
of the figures cut in the rock are taken for marriage-processions and
scenes in domestic life that are represented as joyful. The female
figures are beautiful, delicate, and fair as Europeans. Every one of
these representations is artistic, and all of them are unpolluted by any
grossness or obscenity generally so prominent in Brahmanical
representations of a similar character.

"These caves are visited by a great number of antiquarians, who are
striving to decipher the hieroglyphics inscribed on the walls and
determine the age of these curious temples.

"The ruins of the ancient city of Aurungabad are not very far from these
caves. It was a walled city of great repute, but is now deserted. There
are not only broken walls, but crumbling palaces. They were built of
immense strength, and some of the walls appear as solid as the
everlasting hills.

"There are a great many places in this vicinity where there are Hindu
remains, consisting of deep caves and rock-cut temples. Many of these
temples are surrounded by a circular enclosure, which is often adorned
with statues and columns. The figure of an elephant is very common,
placed before or beside the opening of a temple, as a sort of sentinel.
Hundreds and thousands of niches are beautifully cut in the solid rock,
and when these temples were thronged with worshippers, each niche had a
statue or image, usually in the florid style of these Oriental
sculptures. It is a sad truth that almost every image here is shamefully
defaced and mutilated. It is often said that no Hindu will bow down to
an imperfect image, and that the Mahometans, knowing this, purposely
mutilated all these images to prevent the Hindus from worshipping them.
This is regarded by the Hindus as sacrilegious and blasphemous,
awakening the keenest animosities, which every Hindu inherits from his
father, and which centuries have not been able to efface.

"Here also are the remains of buried cities--sad ruins--generally
without a single inhabitant. In the grand palaces where royalty once
gathered and held festivals, wild beasts find their hiding-places. In
several places the track of the railway has been constructed over or
through these ruins, and the material has been used for the bed of the
road. . . . Enormous stones have remained in their places for thousands
of years, and probably will for thousands of years to come. These rock-

###### <span id="page_351">p. 351</span>

cut temples, as well as these mutilated statues, show a workmanship that
no work now being done by the natives can equal. <span
id="fr_522"></span>[\*](#fn_521.md) It is very evident that hundreds of
years since these hills were alive with a vast multitude, where now it
is all utter desolation, without cultivation or inhabitants, and given
over to wild beasts.

"It is good hunting ground, and, as the English are mighty hunters, they
may prefer to have these mountains and ruins remain without change."

We fervently hope they will. Enough vandalism was perpetrated in earlier
ages to permit us the hope that at least in this century of exploration
and learning, science, in its branches of archaeology and philology,
will not be deprived of these most precious records, wrought on
imperishable tablets of granite and rock.

We will now present a few fragments of this mysterious doctrine of
reincarnation--as distinct from metempsychosis--which we have from an
authority. Reincarnation, *i.e.*, the appearance of the same individual,
or rather of his astral monad, twice on the same planet, is not a rule
in nature; it is an exception, like the teratological phenomenon of a
two-headed infant. It is preceded by a violation of the laws of harmony
of nature, and happens only when the latter, seeking to restore its
disturbed equilibrium, violently throws back into earth-life the astral
monad which had been tossed out of the circle of necessity by crime or
accident. Thus, in cases of abortion, of infants dying before a certain
age, and of congenital and incurable idiocy, nature's original design to
produce a perfect human being, has been interrupted. Therefore, while
the gross matter of each of these several entities is suffered to
disperse itself at death, through the vast realm of being, the immortal
spirit and astral monad of the individual--the latter having been set
apart to animate a frame and the former to shed its divine light on the
corporeal organization--must try a second time to carry out the purpose
of the creative intelligence.

If reason has been so far developed as to become active and
discriminative, there is no reincarnation on this earth, for the three
parts of the triune man have been united together, and he is capable of
running the race. But when the new being has not passed beyond the
condition of monad, or when, as in the idiot, the trinity has not been
completed, the immortal spark which illuminates it, has to reenter on
the earthly plane as it was frustrated in its first attempt. Otherwise,
the mortal or astral,

###### <span id="page_352">p. 352</span>

and the immortal or divine, souls, could not progress in unison and pass
onward to the sphere above. Spirit follows a line parallel with that of
matter; and the spiritual evolution goes hand in hand with the physical.
As in the case exemplified by Professor Le Conte (vide chap. ix.),
"there is no force in nature"--and the rule applies to the spiritual as
well as to the physical evolution--"which is capable of raising at once
spirit or matter from No. 1 to No. 3, or from 2 to 4, without stopping
and receiving an accession of force of a different kind *on the
intermediate plane.*" That is to say, the monad which was imprisoned in
the elementary being--the rudimentary or lowest astral form of the
future man--after having passed through and quitted the *highest*
physical shape of a dumb animal--say an orang-outang, or again an
elephant, one of the most intellectual of brutes--that monad, we say,
cannot skip over the physical and intellectual sphere of the terrestrial
man, and be suddenly ushered into the spiritual sphere above. What
reward or punishment can there be in that sphere of disembodied human
entities for a foetus or a human embryo which had not even time to
breathe on this earth, still less an opportunity to exercise the divine
faculties of the spirit? Or, for an irresponsible infant, whose
senseless monad remaining dormant within the astral and physical casket,
could as little prevent him from burning himself as another person to
death? Or for one idiotic from birth, the number of whose cerebral
circumvolutions is only from twenty to thirty per cent of those of sane
persons; <span id="fr_523"></span>[\*](#fn_522.md) and who therefore is
irresponsible for either his disposition, acts, or the imperfections of
his vagrant, half-developed intellect?

No need to remark that if even hypothetical, this theory is no more
ridiculous than many others considered as strictly orthodox. We must not
forget that either through the inaptness of the specialists or some
other reason, physiology itself is the least advanced or understood of
sciences, and that some French physicians, with Dr. Fournie, positively
despair of ever progressing in it beyond pure hypotheses.

Further, the same occult doctrine recognizes another possibility; albeit
so rare and so vague that it is really useless to mention it. Even the
modern Occidental occultists deny it, though it is universally accepted
in Eastern countries. When, through vice, fearful crimes and animal
passions, a disembodied spirit has fallen to the eighth sphere--the
allegorical Hades, and the *gehenna* of the Bible--the nearest to our
earth--he can, with the help of that glimpse of reason and consciousness
left to him, repent; that is to say, he can, by exercising the remnants
of his will-power, strive upward, and like a drowning man, struggle once
more to the sur-

###### <span id="page_353">p. 353</span>

face. In the *Magical and Philosophical Precepts* of Psellus, we find
one which, warning mankind, says:

> "Stoop not down, for a precipice lies below the earth,  
> Drawing *under* *a descent of* SEVEN *steps,* beneath which  
> Is the throne of dire necessity." <span
> id="fr_524"></span>[\*](#fn_523.md)

A strong aspiration to retrieve his calamities, a pronounced desire,
will draw him once more into the earth's atmosphere. Here he will wander
and suffer more or less in dreary solitude. His instincts will make him
seek with avidity contact with living persons. . . . These spirits are
the invisible but too tangible magnetic vampires; the *subjective*
daemons so well known to mediaeval ecstatics, nuns, and monks, to the
"witches" made so famous in the *Witch-Hammer;* and to certain sensitive
clairvoyants, according to their own confessions. They are the
blood-daemons of Porphyry, the *larvae* and *lemures* of the ancients;
the fiendish instruments which sent so many unfortunate and weak victims
to the rack and stake. Origen held all the daemons which possessed the
demoniacs mentioned in the *New Testament* to be *human* "spirits." It
is because Moses knew so well what they were, and how terrible were the
consequences to weak persons who yielded to their influence, that he
enacted the cruel, murderous law against such would-be "witches"; but
Jesus, full of justice and divine love to humanity, *healed* instead of
*killing* them. Subsequently our clergy, the pretended exemplars of
Christian principles, followed the law of Moses, and quietly ignored the
law of Him whom they call their "one living God," by burning dozens of
thousands of such pretended "witches."

Witch! mighty name, which in the past contained the promise of
ignominious death; and in the present has but to be pronounced to raise
a whirlwind of ridicule, a tornado of sarcasms! How is it then that
there have always been men of intellect and learning, who never thought
that it would disgrace their reputation for learning, or lower their
dignity, to publicly affirm the possibility of such a thing as a
"witch," in the correct acceptation of the word. One such fearless
champion was Henry More, the learned scholar of Cambridge, of the
seventeenth century. It is well worth our while to see how cleverly he
handled the question.

It appears that about the year 1678, a certain divine, named John
Webster, wrote *Criticisms and Interpretations of Scripture,* against
the existence of witches, and other "superstitions." Finding the work "a
weak and impertinent piece," Dr. More criticised it in a letter to
Glanvil, the author of *Sadducismus Triumphatus,* and as an appendix
sent a

###### <span id="page_354">p. 354</span>

treatise on witchcraft and explanations of the word witch, itself. This
document is very rare, but we possess it in a fragmentary form in an old
manuscript, having seen it mentioned besides only in an insignificant
work of 1820, on *Apparitions,* for it appears that the document itself
was long since out of print.

The words *witch* and *wizard*, according to Dr. More, signify no more
than a wise man or a wise woman. In the word *wizard,* it is plain at
the very sight; and "the most plain and least operose deduction of the
name witch, is from *wit*, whose derived adjective might be *wittigh* or
*wittich,* and by contraction, afterwards witch; as the noun wit is from
the verb to *weet,* which is, to know. So that a witch, thus far, is no
more than a knowing woman; which answers exactly to the Latin word
*saga,* according to that of Festus, *sagae dictae anus quae multa
sciunt.*"

This definition of the word appears to us the more plausible, as it
exactly answers the evident meaning of the Slavonian-Russian names for
witches and wizards. The former is called *vyedma*, and the latter
*vyedmak,* both from the verb *to know, vedat* or *vyedat;* the root,
moreover, being positively Sanscrit. "Veda," says Max Muller, in his
*Lecture on the Vedas,* "means originally knowing, or knowledge. Veda is
the same word which appears in Greek οιδα, I know \[the digamma, *vau*
being omitted\], and in the English wise, wisdom, to wit." <span
id="fr_525"></span>[\*](#fn_524.md) Furthermore, the Sanscrit word *vidma*,
answering to the German *wir wissen,* means literally "*we know.*" It is
a great pity that the eminent philologist, while giving in his lecture
the Sanscrit, Greek, Gothic, Anglo-Saxon, and German comparative roots
of this word, has neglected the Slavonian.

Another Russian appellation for *witch* and *wizard*, the former being
purely Slavonian, is *znahar* and *znaharka* (feminine) from the same
verb *znat* to know. Thus Dr. More's definition of the word, given in
1678, is perfectly correct, and coincides in every particular with
modern philology.

"Use," says this scholar, "questionless had appropriated the word to
such a kind of skill and knowledge as was out of the common road or
extraordinary. *Nor did this peculiarity imply any unlawfulness*. But
there was after a further restriction, in which alone now-a-days the
words *witch* and *wizard* are used. And that is, for one that has the
knowledge and skill of doing or telling things in an extraordinary way,
and that in virtue of either an express or implicit sociation or
confederacy with some *bad spirits.*" In the clause of the severe law of
Moses, so many names are reckoned up with that of witch, that it is
difficult as well as useless to give here the definition of every one of
them as found in Dr.

###### <span id="page_355">p. 355</span>

More's able treatise. "There shall not be found among you any one that
useth divination, or an observer of time, or an enchanter, or a witch,
or a charmer, or a consulter with familiar spirits, or a wizard, or a
necromancer," says the text. We will show, further on, the real object
of such severity. For the present, we will remark that Dr. More, after
giving a learned definition of every one of such appellations, and
showing the value of their real meaning in the days of Moses, proves
that there is a vast difference between the "enchanters," "observers of
time," etc., and a witch. "So many names are reckoned up in this
prohibition of Moses, that, as in our common law, the sense may be more
sure, and leave no room to evasion. And that the name of 'witch' is not
from any tricks of legerdemain as in common jugglers, that delude the
sight of the people at a market or fair, but that it is the name of such
as raise magical spectres to deceive men's sight, and so are most
certainly witches--women and men who have a *bad spirit* in them. 'Thou
shalt not suffer' מכשפה *mecassephah,* that is, 'a witch, to live.'
Which would be a law of extreme severity, or rather cruelty, against a
poor hocus-pocus for his tricks of legerdemain."

Thus, it is but the sixth appellation, that of a consulter with familiar
spirits or a witch, that had to incur the greatest penalty of the law of
Moses, for it is only a *witch* which must *not* be suffered to live,
while all the others are simply enumerated as such with whom the people
of Israel were forbidden to communicate on account of their idolatry or
rather religious views and learning chiefly. This sixth word is שיאל
אוב*, shoel aub*, which our English translation renders, "a consulter
with familiar spirits"; but which the Septuagint translates,
ενγαστριμυθος, one that has a familiar spirit *inside* him, one
possessed with the spirit of divination, which was considered to be
Python by the Greeks, and *obh* by the Hebrews, the old serpent; in its
esoteric meaning the spirit of concupiscence and *matter*; which,
according to the kabalists, is always an elementary *human* spirit of
the eighth sphere.

"*Shoel obh,* I conceive," says Henry More, "is to be understood of the
witch herself who asks counsel of her or his familiar. The reason of the
name *obh,* was taken first from that spirit that was in the body of the
party, and swelled it to a protuberancy, the voice always seeming to
come out as from a bottle, for which reason they were named
*ventriloquists. Ob* signifies as much as *Pytho,* which at first took
its name from the *pythii vates,* a spirit that tells hidden things, or
things to come. In *Acts* xvi. 16, πνευμα πυθονος, when "Paul being
grieved, turned and said to that spirit, I command thee, in the name of
Jesus Christ, to come out of her, and he came out at the same hour."
Therefore, the words obsessed or *possessed* are synonyms of the word
*witch;* nor could this

###### <span id="page_356">p. 356</span>

pytho of the eighth sphere come out of her, unless it was a spirit
distinct from her. And so it is that we see in *Leviticus* xx. 27: "A
man also or woman that hath a familiar spirit, or that is a wizard (an
irresponsible *jidegnoni*) shall surely be put *to death,* they shall
stone them with stones, *their blood shall be* upon them."

A cruel and unjust law beyond doubt, and one which gives the lie to a
recent utterance of "Spirits," by the mouth of one of the most popular
*inspirational* mediums of the day, to the effect that modern
philological research proves that the Mosaic law never contemplated the
killing of the poor "mediums" or *witches* of the *Old Testament,* but
that the words, "thou shalt not suffer a witch *to live,*" meant to live
by their mediumship, that is, to gain their livelihood! An
interpretation no less ingenious than novel. Certainly, nowhere short of
the source of such *inspiration* could we find such philological
profundity! <span id="fr_526"></span>[\*](#fn_525.md)

"Shut the door in the face of the daemon," says the *Kabala,* "and he
will keep running away from you, as if you pursued him," which means,
that you must not give a hold on you to such spirits of obsession by
attracting them into an atmosphere of congenial sin.

These daemons seek to introduce themselves into the bodies of the
simple-minded and idiots, and remain there until dislodged therefrom by
a powerful and *pure* will. Jesus, Apollonius, and some of the apostles,
had the power to cast out *devils,* by purifying the atmosphere *within*
and *without* the patient, so as to force the unwelcome tenant to
flight. Certain volatile salts are particularly obnoxious to them; and
the effect of the chemicals used in a saucer, and placed under the bed
by Mr. Varley, of London, <span id="fr_527"></span>[\*\*](#fn_526.md) for
the purpose of keeping away some disagreeable

<span id="page_357">p. 357</span>

physical phenomena at night, are corroborative of this great truth. Pure
or even simply inoffensive human spirits fear nothing, for having rid
themselves of *terrestrial* matter, terrestrial compounds can affect
them in no wise; such spirits are like a *breath.* Not so with the
earth-bound souls and the nature-spirits.

It is for these carnal terrestrial *larvae*, degraded human spirits,
that the ancient kabalists entertained a hope of *reincarnation.* But
when, or how? At a fitting moment, and if helped by a sincere desire for
his amendment and repentance by some strong, sympathizing person, or the
will of an adept, or even a desire emanating from the erring spirit
himself, provided it is powerful enough to make him throw off the burden
of sinful matter. Losing all consciousness, the once bright monad is
caught once more into the vortex of our terrestrial evolution, and it
repasses the subordinate kingdoms, and again breathes as a living child.
To compute the time necessary for the completion of this process would
be impossible. Since there is no perception of time in eternity, the
attempt would be a mere waste of labor.

As we have said, but few kabalists believe in it, and this doctrine
originated with certain astrologers. While casting up the nativities of
certain historical personages renowned for some peculiarities of
disposition, they found the conjunction of the planets answering
perfectly to remarkable oracles and prophesies about other persons born
ages later. Observation, and what would now be termed "remarkable
coincidences," added to revelation during the "sacred sleep" of the
neophyte, disclosed the dreadful truth. So horrible is the thought that
even those who ought to be convinced of it prefer ignoring it, or at
least avoid speaking on the subject.

This way of obtaining oracles was practiced in the highest antiquity. In
India, this sublime lethargy is called "the sacred sleep of \* \* \*" It
is an oblivion into which the subject is thrown by certain magical
processes, supplemented by draughts of the juice of the soma. The body
of the sleeper remains for several days in a condition resembling death,
and by the power of the adept is purified of its earthliness and made
fit

###### <span id="page_358">p. 358</span>

to become the temporary receptacle of the brightness of the immortal
Augoeides. In this state the torpid body is made to reflect the glory of
the upper spheres, as a burnished mirror does the rays of the sun. The
sleeper takes no note of the lapse of time, but upon awakening, after
four or five days of trance, imagines he has slept but a few moments.
What his lips utter he will never know; but as it is the spirit which
directs them they can pronounce nothing but divine truth. For the time
being the poor helpless clod is made the shrine of the sacred presence,
and converted into an oracle a thousand times more infallible than the
asphyxiated Pythoness of Delphi; and, unlike her mantic frenzy, which
was exhibited before the multitude, this holy sleep is witnessed only
within the sacred precinct by those few of the adepts who are worthy to
stand in the presence of the **A**DONAI.

The description which Isaiah gives of the purification necessary for a
prophet to undergo before he is worthy to be the mouthpiece of heaven,
applies to the case in point. In customary metaphor he says: "Then flew
one of the seraphim unto me having a live coal in his hand, which he had
taken with the tongs from off the altar . . . and he laid it upon my
mouth and said, Lo! this hath touched thy lips and thine iniquity is
taken away."

The invocation of his own Augoeides, by the purified adept, is described
in words of unparalleled beauty by Bulwer-Lytton in *Zanoni,* and there
he gives us to understand that the slightest touch of mortal passion
unfits the hierophant to hold communion with his spotless soul. Not only
are there few who can successfully perform the ceremony, but even these
rarely resort to it except for the instruction of some neophytes, and to
obtain knowledge of the most solemn importance.

And yet how little is the knowledge treasured up by these hierophants
understood or appreciated by the general public! "There is another
collection of writings and traditions bearing the title of *Kabala,*
attributed to Oriental scholars," says the author of *Art-Magic;* "but
as this remarkable work is of little or no value without a key, which
*can only be furnished by Oriental fraternities,* its transcript would
be of no value to the general reader." <span
id="fr_528"></span>[\*](#fn_527.md) And how they are ridiculed by every
Houndsditch commercial traveller who wanders through India in pursuit of
"orders" and writes to the *Times,* and misrepresented by every
nimble-fingered trickster who pretends to show by legerdemain, to the
gaping crowd, the feats of true Oriental magicians!

But, notwithstanding his unfairness in the Algerian affair, Robert
Houdin, an authority on the art of prestidigitation, and Moreau-Cinti,

###### <span id="page_359">p. 359</span>

another, gave honest testimony in behalf of the French mediums. They
both testified, when cross-examined by the Academicians, that none but
the "mediums" could possibly produce the phenomena of table-rapping and
levitation without a suitable preparation and furniture adapted for the
purpose. They also showed that the so-called "levitations without
contact" were feats utterly beyond the power of the *professional*
juggler; that for them, such levitations, unless produced in a room
supplied with secret machinery and concave mirrors, was *impossible.*
They added moreover, that the simple apparition of a diaphanous hand, in
a place in which confederacy would be rendered impossible, the medium
having been previously searched, would be a demonstration that it was
the work *of no human agency,* whatever else that agency might be. The
*Siecle,* and other Parisian newspapers immediately published their
suspicions that these two professional and very clever gentlemen had
become the confederates of the spiritists!

Professor Pepper, director of the Polytechnic Institute of London,
invented a clever apparatus to produce spiritual appearances on the
stage, and sold his patent in 1863, in Paris, for the sum of 20,000
francs. The phantoms looked real and were evanescent, being but an
effect produced by the reflection of a highly-illuminated object upon
the surface of plateglass. They seemed to appear and disappear, to walk
about the stage and play their parts to perfection. Sometimes one of the
phantoms placed himself on a bench; after which, one of the living
actors would begin quarrelling with him, and, seizing a heavy hatchet,
would part the head and body of the ghost in two. But, joining his two
parts again, the spectre would reappear, a few steps off, to the
amazement of the public. The contrivance worked marvellously well, and
nightly attracted large crowds. But to produce these ghosts required a
stage-apparatus, and more than one confederate. There were nevertheless
some reporters who made this exhibition the pretext for ridiculing the
*spiritists--*as though the two classes of phenomena had the slightest
connection!

What the Pepper ghosts pretended to do, genuine disembodied human
spirits, when their reflection is materialized by the elementals, can
actually perform. They will permit themselves to be perforated with
bullets or the sword, or to be dismembered, and then instantly form
themselves anew. But the case is different with both cosmic and human
elementary spirits, for a sword or dagger, or even a pointed stick, will
cause them to vanish in terror. This will seem unaccountable to those
who do not understand of what a material substance the elementary are
composed; but the kabalists understand perfectly. The records of
antiquity and of the middle ages, to say nothing of the modern wonders
at Cideville, which have been judicially attested for us, corroborate
these facts.

###### <span id="page_360">p. 360</span>

Skeptics, and even skeptical spiritualists, have often unjustly accused
mediums of fraud, when denied what they considered their inalienable
right to test the spirits. But where there is one such case, there are
fifty in which spiritualists have permitted themselves to be practiced
upon by tricksters, while they neglected to appreciate genuine
manifestations procured for them by their mediums. Ignorant of the laws
of mediumship, such do not know that when an honest medium is once taken
possession of by spirits, whether disembodied or elemental, he is no
longer his own master. He cannot control the actions of the spirits, nor
even his own. They make him a puppet to dance at their pleasure while
they pull the wires behind the scenes. The false medium may seem
entranced, and yet be playing tricks all the while; while the real
medium may appear to be in full possession of his senses, when in fact
he is far away, and his body is animated by his "Indian guide," or
"control." Or, he may be entranced in his cabinet, while his astral body
(double) or *doppelganger,* is walking about the room moved by another
intelligence.

Among all the phenomena, that of *re-percussion,* closely allied with
those of bi-location and aerial "travelling," is the most astounding. In
the middle ages it was included under the head of sorcery. De Gasparin,
in his refutations of the miraculous character of the marvels of
Cideville, treats of the subject at length; but these pretended
explanations were all in their turn exploded by de Mirville and des
Mousseaux, who, while failing in their attempt to trace the phenomena
back to the Devil, did, nevertheless, prove their spiritual origin.

"The prodigy of re-percussion," says des Mousseaux, "occurs when a blow
aimed at the spirit, visible or otherwise, of an absent *living* person,
or at the phantom which represents him, strikes this person himself, at
the same time, and in the very place at which the spectre or his double
is touched! We must suppose, therefore, that the blow is re-percussed,
and that it reaches, as if rebounding, from the image of the living
person--his phantasmal <span id="fr_529"></span>[\*](#fn_528.md)
duplicate--the original, wherever he may be, in flesh and blood.

"Thus, for instance, an individual appears before me, or, remaining
invisible, declares war, threatens, and causes me to be threatened with
obsession. I strike at the place where I perceive his phantom, where I
hear him moving, where I feel *somebody,* something which molests and
resists me. I strike; the blood will appear sometimes on this place, and
occasionally a scream may be heard; *he* is wounded--perhaps, dead! It
is done, and I have explained the fact." <span
id="fr_530"></span>[\*\*](#fn_529.md)

###### <span id="page_361">p. 361</span>

"Notwithstanding that, at the moment I struck him, his presence in
another place is authentically proved; . . . I saw--yes, I saw plainly
the phantom hurt upon the cheek or shoulder, and this same wound is
found precisely on the living person, re-percussed upon his cheek or
shoulder. Thus, it becomes evident that the facts of re-percussion have
an intimate connection with those of bi-location or *duplication,*
either spiritual or corporeal."

The history of the Salem witchcraft, as we find it recorded in the works
of Cotton Mather, Calef, Upham, and others, furnishes a curious
corroboration of the fact of the double, as it also does of the effects
of allowing elementary spirits to have their own way. This tragical
chapter of American history has never yet been written in accordance
with the truth. A party of four or five young girls had become
"developed" as mediums, by sitting with a West Indian negro woman, a
practitioner of *Obeah.* They began to suffer all kinds of physical
torture, such as pinching, having pins stuck in them, and the marks of
bruises and teeth on different parts of their bodies. They would declare
that they were hurt by the spectres of various persons, and we learn
from the celebrated *Narrative of Deodat Lawson* (London, 1704), that
"some of them confessed that they did afflict the sufferers (*i.e*.,
these young girls), according to the time and manner they were accused
thereof; and, being asked what they did to afflict them, some said that
they pricked pins into poppets, made with rags, wax, and other
materials. One that confessed after the signing of her death-warrant,
said she used to afflict them by clutching and pinching her hands
together, and *wishing* in what part and after what manner she would
have them afflicted, and *it was done.*"

Mr. Upham <span id="fr_531"></span>[\*](#fn_530.md) tells us that Abigail
Hobbs, one of these girls, acknowledged that she had confederated with
the Devil, who "came to her in the shape of a man," and commanded her to
afflict the girls, bringing images made of wood in their likeness, with
thorns for her to prick into the images, which she did; whereupon, the
girls cried out that they were hurt by her."

###### <span id="page_362">p. 362</span>

How perfectly these facts, the validity of which was proven by
unimpeachable testimony in court, go to corroborate the doctrine of
Paracelsus. It is surpassingly strange that so ripe a scholar as Mr.
Upham should have accumulated into the 1,000 pages of his two volumes
such a mass of legal evidence, going to show the agency of earth-bound
souls and tricksy nature-spirits in these tragedies, without suspecting
the truth.

Ages ago, the old Ennius was made by Lucretius to say:

> "Bis duo sunt homines, manes, caro, *spiritus* umbra;  
> Quatuor ista loci bis duo suscipirent;  
> Terra tegit carnem;--tumulum circumvolat umbra,  
> Orcus habet manes."

In this present case, as in every similar one, the scientists, being
unable to explain the fact, assert that *it cannot* exist.

But we will now give a few historical instances going to show that some
daimons, or elementary spirits, are afraid of sword, knife, or any thing
sharp. We do not pretend to explain the reason. That is the province of
physiology and psychology. Unfortunately, physiologists have not yet
been able to even establish the relations between speech and thought,
and so, have handed it over to the metaphysicians, who, in their turn,
according to Fournie, have done nothing. Done nothing, we say, but
claimed everything. No fact could be presented to some of them, that was
too large for these learned gentlemen to at least try to stuff into
their pigeon-holes, labelled with some fancy Greek name, expressive of
everything else but the true nature of the phenomenon.

"Alas, alas! my son!" exclaims the wise Muphti, of Aleppo, to his son
Ibrahim, who choked himself with the head of a huge fish. "When will you
realize that your stomach is smaller than the ocean?" Or, as Mrs.
Catherine Crowe remarks in her *Night-Side of Nature,* when will our
scientists admit that "their intellects are no measure of God Almighty's
designs?"

We will not ask which of the ancient writers mention facts of
seemingly*-supernatural* nature; but rather which of them does not? In
Homer, we find Ulysses evoking the spirit of his friend, the soothsayer
Tiresias. Preparing for the ceremony of the "festival of blood," Ulysses
draws his sword, and thus frightens away the thousands of phantoms
attracted by the sacrifice. The friend himself, the so-long-expected
Tiresias, dares not approach him so long as Ulysses holds the dreaded
weapon in his hand. <span id="fr_532"></span>[\*](#fn_531.md) Æneas
prepares to descend to the kingdom of the shadows, and as soon as they
approach its entrance, the Sibyl who

###### <span id="page_363">p. 363</span>

guides him utters her warning to the Trojan hero, and orders him to draw
his sword and clear himself a passage through the dense crowd of
flitting forms:

> "*Tuque invade viam, vaginaque eripe ferrum*." <span
> id="fr_533"></span>[\*](#fn_532.md)

Glanvil gives a wonderful narrative of the apparition of the "Drummer of
Tedworth," which happened in 1661; in which the *scin-lecca,* or double,
of the drummer-sorcerer was evidently very much afraid of the sword.
Psellus, in his work, <span id="fr_534"></span>[\*\*](#fn_533.md) gives a
long story of his sister-in-law being thrown into a most fearful state
by an elementary *daimon* taking possession of her. She was finally
cured by a conjurer, a foreigner named Anaphalangis, who began by
threatening the invisible occupant of her body with a *naked sword,*
until he finally dislodged him. Psellus introduces a whole catechism of
demonology, which he gives in the following terms, as far as we
remember:

"You want to know," asked the conjurer, "whether the bodies of the
spirits can be hurt by sword or any other weapon? <span
id="fr_535"></span>[\*\*\*](#fn_534.md) Yes, they can. Any hard substance
striking them can make them sensible to pain; and though their bodies be
made neither of solid nor firm substance, they feel it the same, for in
beings endowed with sensibility it is not their nerves only which
possess the faculty of feeling, but likewise also the spirit which
resides in them . . . the body of a spirit can be sensible in its
*whole,* as well as in each one of its parts. Without the help of any
physical organism the spirit sees, hears, and if you touch him feels
your touch. If you divide him in two, he will feel the pain as would any
living man, for he is *matter* still, though so refined as to be
generally invisible to our eye. . . . One thing, however, distinguishes
him from the living man, viz.: that when a man's limbs are once divided,
their parts cannot be reunited very easily. But, cut a *demon* in two,
and you will see him immediately join himself together. As water or air
closes in behind a solid body <span
id="fr_536"></span>[\*\*\*\*](#fn_535.md) passing through it, and no trace
is left, so does the body of a demon condense itself again, when the
penetrative weapon is withdrawn from the wound. But every rent made in
it causes him pain nevertheless. *That* *is why daimons* dread the point
of a sword or any sharp weapon. Let those who want to see them flee try
the experiment."

One of the most learned scholars of his century, Bodin, the
Demonologian,

###### <span id="page_364">p. 364</span>

held the same opinion, that both the human and cosmical elementaries
"were sorely afraid of swords and daggers." It is also the opinion of
Porphyry, Iamblichus, and Plato. Plutarch mentions it several times. The
practicing theurgists knew it well and acted accordingly; and many of
the latter assert that "the demons suffer from any rent made in their
bodies." Bodin tells us a wonderful story to this effect, in his work
*On the Daemons,* p. 292.

"I remember," says the author, "that in 1557 an elemental demon, one of
those who are called *thundering,* fell down *with the lightning,* into
the house of Poudot, the shoemaker, and immediately began flinging
stones all about the room. We picked up so many of them that the
landlady filled a large chest full, after having securely closed the
windows and doors and locked the chest itself. But it did not prevent
the demon in the least from introducing other stones into the room, but
without injuring any one for all that. Latomi, who was then
*Quarter-President*, <span id="fr_537"></span>[\*](#fn_536.md) came to see
what was the matter. Immediately upon his entrance, the spirit knocked
the cap off his head and made him run away. It had lasted for over six
days, when M. Jean Morgnes, Counsellor at the *Presidial,* came to fetch
me to see the mystery. When I entered the house, some one advised the
master of it to pray to God with all his heart and to wheel round a
sword in the air about the room; he did so. On that following day the
landlady told us, that from that very moment they did not hear the least
noise in the house; but that during the seven previous days that it
lasted they could not get a moment's rest."

The books on the witchcraft of the middle ages are full of such
narratives. The very rare and interesting work of Glanvil, called
*Sadducismus Triumphatus,* ranks with that of Bodin, above mentioned, as
one of the best. But we must give space now to certain narratives of the
more ancient philosophers, who explain at the same time that they
describe.

And first in rank for wonders comes Proclus. His list of facts, most of
which he supports by the citation of witnesses--sometimes well-known
philosophers--is staggering. He records many instances in his time of
dead persons who were found to have changed their recumbent positions in
the sepulchre, for one of either sitting or standing, which he
attributes to their being *larvae*, and which he says "is related by the
ancients of Aristius, Epimenides, and Hermodorus." He gives five such
cases from the history of Clearchus, the disciple of Aristotle. 1.
Cleonymus, the Athenian. 2. Polykritus, an illustrious man among the
AEolians. It is related by the historian Nomachius, that Polykritus
died, and returned in the ninth month after his death. "Hiero, the
Ephesian, and other

###### <span id="page_365">p. 365</span>

historians," says his translator, Taylor, "testify to the truth of
this." 3. In Nicopolis, the same happened to one Eurinus. The latter
revived on the fifteenth day after his burial, and lived for some time
after that, leading an exemplary life. 4. Rufus, a priest of
Thessalonica, restored to life the third day after his death, for the
purpose of performing certain sacred ceremonies according to promise; he
fulfilled his engagement, and died again to return no more. 5. This is
the case of one Philonaea, who lived under the reign of Philip. She was
the daughter of Demostratus and Charito of Amphipolos. Married against
her wish to one Kroterus, she died soon after. But in the sixth month
after her death, she revived, as Proclus says: "through her love of a
youth named Machates, who came to her father Demostratus, from Pella."
She visited him for many nights successively, but when this was finally
discovered, she, or rather the vampire that represented her, died of
rage. Previous to this she declared that she acted in this manner
according to the will of *terrestrial demons.* Her dead body was seen at
this second death by every one in the town, lying in her father's house.
On opening the vault, where her body had been deposited, it was found
empty by those of her relatives, who being incredulous upon that point,
went to ascertain the truth. The narrative is corroborated by the
*Epistles of Hipparchus* and those of Arridaeus to Philip. <span
id="fr_538"></span>[\*](#fn_537.md)

Says Proclus: "Many other of the ancients have collected a history of
those that have apparently died, and afterward revived. Among these is
the natural philosopher Demokritus. In his writings concerning Hades, he
affirms that \[in a certain case under discussion\] death was not, as it
seemed, an entire desertion of the whole life of the body, but a
cessation caused by some blow, or perhaps a wound; but the bonds of the
soul yet remained rooted about the marrow, and the heart contained in
its profundity the empyreuma of life; and this remaining, it again
acquired the life, which had been extinguished, in consequence of being
adapted to animation."

He says again, "That it is possible for the soul to depart from and
enter into the body, is evident from him, who, according to Clearchus,
used a *soul-attracting wand* on a sleeping boy; and who persuaded
Aristotle, as Clearchus relates in his *Treatise on Sleep,* that the
soul may be separated from the body, and that it enters into a body and
uses it as a lodging. For, striking the boy with the wand, he drew out,
and, as it were, led his soul, for the purpose of evincing that the body
was immova-

###### <span id="page_366">p. 366</span>

ble when the soul (astral body) was at a distance from it, and that it
was preserved uninjured; but the soul being again led into the body by
means of the wand, after its entrance, narrated every particular. From
this circumstance, therefore, both the spectators and Aristotle were
persuaded that the soul is separate from the body."

It may be considered quite absurd to recall so often the facts of
witchcraft, in the full light of the nineteenth century. But the century
itself is getting old; and as it gradually approaches the fatal end, it
seems as if it were falling into dotage; not only does it refuse to
recollect how abundantly the facts of witchcraft were proven, but it
refuses to realize what has been going on for the last thirty years, all
over the wide world. After a lapse of several thousand years we may
doubt the magic powers of the Thessalonian priests and their
"sorceries," as mentioned by Pliny; <span
id="fr_539"></span>[\*](#fn_538.md) we may throw discredit upon the
information given us by Suidas, who narrates Medea's journey through the
air, and thus forget that magic was the highest knowledge of natural
philosophy; but how are we to dispose of the frequent occurrence of
precisely such journeys "through the air" when they happen before our
own eyes, and are corroborated by the testimony of hundreds of
apparently sane persons? If the universality of a belief be a proof of
its truth, few facts have been better established than that of sorcery.
"Every people, from the rudest to the most refined, we may also add in
every age, have believed in the kind of supernatural agency, which we
understand by this term," says Thomas Wright, the author of *Sorcery and
Magic,* and a skeptical member of the National Institute of France. "It
was founded on the equally extensive creed, that, besides our own
visible existence, we live in an invisible world of spiritual beings, by
which our actions *and even our thoughts* are often guided, and which
have a certain degree of power over the elements and over the ordinary
course of organic life." Further, marvelling how this mysterious science
flourished everywhere, and noticing several famous schools of magic in
different parts of Europe, he explains the time-honored belief, and
shows the difference between sorcery and magic as follows: "The magician
differed from the witch in this, that, *while* *the latter was an
ignorant instrument in the hands of the demons, the former had become
their master by the powerful intermediation of Science,* which was only
within reach of the few, and which these beings were unable to
disobey." <span id="fr_540"></span>[\*\*](#fn_539.md) This delineation,
established and known since the days of Moses, the author gives as
derived from "the most authentic sources."

###### <span id="page_367">p. 367</span>

If from this unbeliever we pass to the authority of an adept in that
mysterious science, the anonymous author of *Art-Magic,* we find him
stating the following: "The reader may inquire wherein consists the
difference between a medium and a magician? . . . The medium is one
through whose astral spirit other spirits can manifest, making their
presence known by various kinds of phenomena. Whatever these consist in,
the medium is only a passive agent in their hands. He can *neither
command* their presence, nor *will* their absence; can never compel the
performance of any special act, nor direct its nature. The magician, on
the contrary, *can summon and dismiss spirits at will;* can perform many
feats of occult power through his own spirit; can compel the presence
and assistance of spirits of lower grades of being than himself, and
effect transformations in the realm of nature upon animate and inanimate
bodies." <span id="fr_541"></span>[\*](#fn_540.md)

This learned author forgot to point out a marked distinction in
mediumship, with which he must have been entirely familiar. Physical
phenomena are the result of the manipulation of forces through the
physical system of the medium, by the unseen intelligences, of whatever
class. In a word, physical mediumship depends on a peculiar organization
of the *physical* system; spiritual mediumship, which is accompanied by
a display of subjective, intellectual phenomena, depends upon a like
peculiar organization of the *spiritual* nature of the medium. As the
potter from one lump of clay fashions a vessel of dishonor, and from
another a vessel of honor, so, among physical mediums, the plastic
astral spirit of one may be prepared for a certain class of objective
phenomena, and that of another for a different one. Once so prepared, it
appears difficult to alter the phase of mediumship, as when a bar of
steel is forged into a certain shape, it cannot be used for any other
than its original purpose without difficulty. As a rule, mediums who
have been developed for one class of phenomena rarely change to another,
but repeat the same performance

ad infinitum.

Psychography, or the direct writing of messages by spirits, partakes of
both forms of mediumship. The writing itself is an objective physical
fact, while the sentiments it contains may be of the very noblest
character. The latter depend entirely on the moral state of the medium.
It does not require that he should be educated, to write philosophical
treatises worthy of Aristotle, nor a poet, to write verses that would
reflect honor upon a Byron or a Lamartine; but it does require that the
soul of the medium shall be pure enough to serve as a channel for
spirits who are capable of giving utterance to such lofty sentiments.

###### <span id="page_368">p. 368</span>

In *Art-Magic,* one of the most delightful pictures presented to us is
that of an innocent little child-medium, in whose presence, during the
past three years, four volumes of **MSS**., in the ancient Sanscrit,
have been written by the spirits, without pens, pencils, or ink. "It is
enough," says the author, "to lay the blank sheets on a tripod,
carefully screened from the direct rays of light, but still dimly
visible to the eyes of attentive observers. The child sits on the ground
and lays her head on the tripod, embracing its supports with her little
arms. In this attitude she most commonly sleeps for an hour, during
which time the sheets lying on the tripod are filled up with exquisitely
formed characters in the ancient Sanscrit." This is so remarkable an
instance of psychographic mediumship, and so thoroughly illustrates the
principle we have above stated, that we cannot refrain from quoting a
few lines from one of the Sanscrit writings, the more so as it embodies
that portion of the Hermetic philosophy relating to the antecedent state
of man, which elsewhere we have less satisfactorily described.

"Man lives on many earths before he reaches this. Myriads of worlds
swarm in space where the soul in rudimental states performs its
pilgrimages, ere he reaches the large and shining planet named the
Earth, the glorious function of which is to confer *self-consciousness.*
At this point only is he man; at every other stage of his vast, wild
journey he is but an embryonic being--a fleeting, temporary shape of
matter--a creature in which a *part,* but only a part, of the high,
imprisoned soul shines forth; a rudimental shape, with rudimental
functions, ever living, dying, sustaining a flitting spiritual existence
as rudimental as the material shape from whence it emerged; a butterfly,
springing up from the chrysalitic shell, but ever, as it onward rushes,
in new births, new deaths, new incarnations, anon to die and live again,
but still stretch upward, still strive onward, still rush on the giddy,
dreadful, toilsome, rugged path, until it awakens once more--once more
to live and be a material shape, a thing of dust, a creature of flesh
and blood, but now--*a man.*" <span id="fr_542"></span>[\*](#fn_541.md)

We witnessed once in India a trial of psychical skill between a holy
*gossein* <span id="fr_543"></span>[\*\*](#fn_542.md) and a sorcerer, <span
id="fr_544"></span>[\*\*\*](#fn_543.md) which recurs to us in this
connection. We had been discussing the relative powers of the fakir's
Pitris,--pre-Adamite spirits, and the juggler's invisible allies. A
trial of skill was agreed upon, and the writer was chosen as a referee.
We were taking our noon-day rest, beside a small lake in Northern India.
Upon the surface of the glassy water floated innumerable aquatic
flowers, and large shining leaves. Each of the contestants plucked a
leaf. The fakir, laying his against his breast, folded his hands across
it, and fell into a mo-

###### <span id="page_369">p. 369</span>

mentary trance. He then laid the leaf, with its surface downward, upon
the water. The juggler pretended to control the "water-master," the
spirit dwelling in the water; and boasted that he would compel the
*power* to prevent the Pitris from manifesting any phenomena upon the
fakir's leaf in *their* element. He took his own leaf and tossed it upon
the water, after going through a form of barbarous incantation. It at
once exhibited a violent agitation, while the other leaf remained
perfectly motionless. After the lapse of a few seconds, both leaves were
recovered. Upon that of the fakir were found--much to the indignation of
the juggler--something that looked like a symmetrical design traced in
milk-white characters, as though the juices of the plant had been used
as a corrosive writing fluid. When it became dry, and an opportunity was
afforded to examine the lines with care, it proved to be a series of
exquisitely-formed Sanscrit characters; the whole composed a sentence
embodying a high moral precept. The fakir, let us add, could neither
read nor write. Upon the juggler's leaf, instead of writing, was found
the tracing of a most hideous, impish face. Each leaf, therefore, bore
an impression or allegorical reflection of the character of the
contestant, and indicated the quality of spiritual beings with which he
was surrounded. But, with deep regret, we must once more leave India,
with its blue sky and mysterious past, its religious devotees and its
weird sorcerers, and on the enchanted carpet of the historian, transport
ourselves back to the musty atmosphere of the French Academy.

To appreciate the timidity, prejudice, and superficiality which have
marked the treatment of psychological subjects in the past, we propose
to review a book which lies before us. It is the *Histoire du
Merveilleux dans les Temps Modernes.* The work is published by its
author, the learned Dr. Figuier, and teems with quotations from the most
conspicuous authorities in physiology, psychology, and medicine. Dr.
Calmeil, the well-known director-in-chief of Charenton, the famous
lunatic asylum of France, is the robust Atlas on whose mighty shoulders
rests this world of erudition. As the ripe fruit of the thought of 1860
it must forever keep a place among the most curious of works of *art*.
Moved by the restless demon of science, determined to kill
superstition--and, as a consequence, spiritism--at one blow, the author
affords us a summary view of the most remarkable instances of
mediumistic phenomena during the last two centuries.

The discussion embraces the Prophets of Cevennes, the Camisards, the
Jansenists, the Abbe Paris, and other historical epidemics, which, as
they have been described during the last twenty years by nearly every
writer upon the modern phenomena, we will mention as briefly as
possible. It is not *facts* that we desire to bring again under
discussion, but

###### <span id="page_370">p. 370</span>

merely the way in which such facts were regarded and treated by those
who, as physicians and recognized authorities, had the greater
responsibility in such questions. If this prejudiced author is
introduced to our readers at this time, it is only because his work
enables us to show what occult facts and manifestations may expect from
orthodox science. When the most world-renowned psychological epidemics
are so treated, what will induce a materialist to seriously study other
phenomena as well authenticated and as interesting, but still less
popular? Let it be remembered that the reports made by various
committees to their respective academies at that time, as well as the
records of the judicial tribunals, are still in existence, and may be
consulted for purposes of verification. It is from such unimpeachable
sources that Dr. Figuier compiled his extraordinary work. We must give,
at least, in substance, the unparalleled arguments with which the author
seeks to demolish every form of super-naturalism, together with the
commentaries of the demonological des Mousseaux, who, in one of his
works, <span id="fr_545"></span>[\*](#fn_544.md) pounces upon his skeptical
victim like a tiger upon his prey.

Between the two champions--the materialist and the bigot--the unbiassed
student may glean a good harvest.

We will begin with the Convulsionnaires of Cevennes, the epidemic of
whose astounding phenomena occurred during the latter part of 1700. The
merciless measures adopted by the French Catholics to extirpate the
spirit of prophecy from an entire population, is historical, and needs
no repetition here. The fact alone that a mere handful of men, women,
and children, not exceeding 2,000 persons in number, could withstand for
years king's troops, which, with the militia, amounted to 60,000 men, is
a miracle in itself. The marvels are all recorded, and the *proces
verbaux* of the time preserved in the Archives of France until this day.
There is in existence an official report among others, which was sent to
Rome by the ferocious Abbe Chayla, the prior of Laval, in which he
complains that the *Evil One* is so powerful, that no torture, no amount
of inquisitory exorcism, is able to dislodge him from the Cevennois. He
adds, that he closed their hands upon burning coals, and they were not
even singed; that he had wrapped their whole persons in *cotton soaked
with oil, and had set them on fire,* and in many cases did not find one
blister on their skins; that balls were shot at them, and found
flattened between the skin and clothes, without injuring them, etc.,
etc.

Accepting the whole of the above as a solid ground-work for his learned
arguments, this is what Dr. Figuier says: "Toward the close of the
seventeenth century, an old maid imports into Cevennes the spirit of

###### <span id="page_371">p. 371</span>

prophecy. She communicates it (?) to young boys and girls, who transpire
it in their turn, and spread it in the surrounding atmosphere. . . .
Women and children become the most sensitive to the infection" (vol.
ii., p. 261). "Men, women, and *babies* speak under inspiration, not in
ordinary *patois,* but in the purest French--a language at that time
utterly unknown in the country. Children of twelve months, and even
less, as we learn from the *proces verbaux,* who previously could hardly
utter a few short syllables, spoke fluently, and prophesied." "Eight
thousand prophets," says Figuier, "were scattered over the country;
doctors and eminent physicians were sent for." Half of the medical
schools of France, among others, the Faculty of Montpellier, hastened to
the spot. Consultations were held, and the physicians declared
themselves "delighted, lost in wonder and admiration, upon hearing young
girls and boys, ignorant and illiterate, deliver discourses on things
*they had never learned*." <span id="fr_546"></span>[\*](#fn_545.md) The
sentence pronounced by Figuier against these treacherous professional
brethren, for being so delighted with the young prophets, is that they
"did not understand, themselves, what they saw." <span
id="fr_547"></span>[\*\*](#fn_546.md) Many of the prophets forcibly
communicated their spirit to those who tried to break the spell. <span
id="fr_548"></span>[\*\*\*](#fn_547.md) A great number of them were
*between three and twelve years* of age; still others *were* *at the
breast,* and spoke French distinctly and correctly. <span
id="fr_549"></span>[\*\*\*\*](#fn_548.md) These discourses, which often
lasted for several hours, would have been impossible to the little
orators, were the latter in their natural or normal state. <span
id="fr_550"></span>[\*\*\*\*\*](#fn_549.md)

"Now," asks the reviewer, "what was the meaning of such a series of
prodigies, all of them freely admitted in Figuier's book? No meaning at
all! It was nothing," he says, "except the effect of a 'momentary
exaltation of the intellectual faculties.' " <span
id="fr_551"></span>[\*\*\*\*\*\*](#fn_550.md) "These phenomena," he adds,
"are observable in many of the cerebral affections."

"*Momentary exaltation,* lasting for many hours *in the brains of babies
under one year old,* not weaned yet, speaking good French before they
had learned to say one word in their own *patois!* Oh, miracle of
physiology! *Prodigy* ought to be thy name!" exclaims des Mousseaux.

"Dr. Calmeil, in his work on insanity," remarks Figuier, "when reporting
on the ecstatic *theomania* of the Calvinists, concludes that the
disease must be attributed in the simpler cases to HYSTERIA, and in
those of more serious character to *epilepsy*. . . . We rather incline
to the opinion," says Figuier, "that it was a disease *sui generis,* and
in order

###### <span id="page_372">p. 372</span>

to have an appropriate name for such a disease, we must be satisfied
with the one of the Trembling Convulsionaires of Cevennes." <span
id="fr_552"></span>[\*](#fn_551.md)

Theomania and *hysteria*, again! The medical corporations must
themselves be possessed with an incurable *atomomania*; otherwise why
should they give out such absurdities for science, and hope for their
acceptance?

"Such was the fury for exorcising and *roasting*," continues Figuier,
"that monks saw possessions by demons everywhere when they felt in need
of miracles to either throw more light on the omnipotency of the Devil,
or keep their dinner-pot boiling at the convent." <span
id="fr_553"></span>[\*\*](#fn_552.md)

For this sarcasm the pious des Mousseaux expresses a heartfelt gratitude
to Figuier; for, as he remarks, "he is *in France* one of the first
writers whom we find, to our surprise, *not denying* the phenomena which
have been made long since *undeniable*. Moved by a sense of lofty
superiority and even disdain for the method used by his predecessors,
Dr. Figuier desires his readers to know that he does *not* follow the
same path as they. 'We will not reject,' says he, 'as being unworthy of
credit, *facts* only because they are embarrassing for our system. On
the contrary, we will collect all of the facts that the same historical
evidence has transmitted to us . . . and which, consequently, are
entitled to the same credence, and it is upon the whole mass of such
facts that we will base the *natural explanation*, which we have to
offer, in our turn, as a sequel to those of the savants who have
preceded us on this subject.' " <span
id="fr_554"></span>[\*\*\*](#fn_553.md)

Thereupon, Dr. Figuier proceeds. <span
id="fr_555"></span>[\*\*\*\*](#fn_554.md) He takes a few steps, and,
placing himself right in the midst of the Convulsionaires of St. Medard,
he invites his readers to scrutinize, under his direction, *prodigies*
which are for him but simple effects of nature.

But before we proceed, in our turn, to show Dr. Figuier's opinion, we
must refresh the reader's memory as to what the Jansenist miracles
comprised, according to historical evidence.

Abbe Paris was a Jansenist, who died in 1727. Immediately after his
decease the most surprising phenomena began to occur at his tomb. The
churchyard was crowded from morning till night. Jesuits, exasperated at
seeing heretics perform wonders in healing, and other works, got from
the magistrates an order to close all access to the tomb of the Abbe.
But, notwithstanding every opposition, the wonders lasted for over
twenty years. Bishop Douglas, who went to Paris for that sole purpose in
1749, visited the place, and he reports that the miracles were still
going on among the Convulsionaires. When every endeavor to stop them
failed, the Catholic clergy were forced to admit their reality, but
screened them-

###### <span id="page_373">p. 373</span>

selves, as usual, behind the Devil. Hume, in his *Philosophical Essays,*
says: "There surely never was so great a number of miracles ascribed to
one person as those which were lately said to have been wrought in
France upon the tomb of the Abbe Paris. The curing of the sick, giving
hearing to the deaf and sight to the blind, were everywhere talked of as
the effects of the holy sepulchre. But, what is more extraordinary, many
of the miracles were immediately proved *upon the spot,* before judges
of unquestioned credit and distinction, in a learned age, and on the
most eminent theatre that is now in the world . . . nor were the
Jesuits, though a learned body, supported by the civil magistrates, and
determined enemies to those opinions in whose favor the miracles were
said to have been wrought, ever able distinctly to refute or detect them
. . . such is historic evidence." <span id="fr_556"></span>[\*](#fn_555.md)
Dr. Middleton, in his *Free Enquiry,* a book which be wrote at a period
when the manifestations were already decreasing, *i.e*., about nineteen
years after they had first begun, declares that the evidence of these
miracles is fully as strong as that of the wonders recorded of the
Apostles.

The phenomena so well authenticated by thousands of witnesses before
magistrates, and in spite of the Catholic clergy, are among the most
wonderful in history. Carre de Montgeron, a member of parliament and a
man who became famous for his connection with the Jansenists, enumerates
them carefully in his work. It comprises four thick quarto volumes, of
which the first is dedicated to the king, under the title: "*La*
*Verite* *des Miracles operes par l'Intercession de M. de Paris,
demontree contre l'Archeveque de Sens. Ouvrage dedie au Roi, par M. de
Montgeron,* *Conseiller au Parlement.*" The author presents a vast
amount of personal and official evidence to the truthfulness of every
case. For speaking *disrespectfully* of the Roman clergy, Montgeron was
thrown into the Bastille, but his work was accepted.

And now for the views of Dr. Figuier upon these remarkable and
unquestionably historical phenomena. "A Convulsionary bends back into an
arc, her loins supported by the sharp point of a peg," quotes the
learned author, from the *proces verbaux.* "The pleasure that she begs
for is to be pounded by a stone weighing fifty pounds, and suspended by
a rope passing over a pulley fixed to the ceiling. The stone, being
hoisted to its extreme height, falls with all its weight upon the
patient's stomach, her back resting all the while on the sharp point of
the peg. Montgeron and numerous other witnesses testified to the fact
that neither the flesh nor the skin of the back were ever marked in the
least, and that the girl, to show she suffered no pain whatever, kept
crying out, 'Strike harder--harder!'

###### <span id="page_374">p. 374</span>

"Jeanne Maulet, a girl of twenty, leaning with her back against a wall,
received upon her stomach one hundred blows of a hammer weighing thirty
pounds; the blows, administered by a very strong man, were so terrible
that they shook the wall. To test the force of the blows, Montgeron
tried them on the stone wall against which the girl was leaning. . . .
He gets one of the instruments of the Jansenist healing, called the
'GRAND SECOURS.' At the twenty-fifth blow," he writes, "the stone upon
which I struck, which had been shaken by the preceding efforts, suddenly
became loose and fell on the other side of the wall, making an aperture
more than half a foot in size." When the blows are struck with violence
upon an iron drill held against the stomach of a Convulsionnaire (who,
sometimes, is but a weak woman), "it seems," says Montgeron, "as if it
would penetrate through to the spine and rupture all the entrails under
the force of the blows" (vol. i., p. 380). "But, so far from that
occurring, the Convulsionnaire cries out, with an expression of perfect
rapture in her face, 'Oh, how delightful! Oh, that does me good!
Courage, brother; strike twice as hard, if you can!' It now remains,"
continues Dr. Figuier, "to try to explain the strange phenomena which we
have described."

"We have said, in the introduction to this work, that at the middle of
the nineteenth century one of the most famous epidemics of possession
broke out in Germany: that of the *Nonnains,* who performed all the
miracles most admired since the days of St. Medard, and even some
greater ones; who turned summersaults, who CLIMBED DEAD WALLS, and spoke
FOREIGN LANGUAGES." <span id="fr_557"></span>[\*](#fn_556.md)

The official report of the wonders, which is more full than that of
Figuier, adds such further particulars as that "the affected persons
would stand on their heads for hours together, and correctly describe
distant events, even such as were happening in the homes of the
committee-men; as it was subsequently verified. Men and women were held
suspended in the air, by an invisible force, and the combined efforts of
the committee were insufficient to pull them down. Old women climbed
perpendicular walls thirty feet in height with the agility of wild cats,
etc., etc."

Now, one should expect that the learned critic, the eminent physician
and psychologist, who not only credits such incredible phenomena but
himself describes them minutely, and *con amore,* so to say, would
necessarily startle the reading public with some explanation so
extraordinary that his scientific views would cause a real hegira to the
unexplored fields of psychology. Well, he does startle us, for to all
this he quietly

###### <span id="page_375">p. 375</span>

observes: "Recourse *was had to marriage* to bring to a stop these
disorders of the Convulsionnaires!" <span
id="fr_558"></span>[\*](#fn_557.md)

For once des Mousseaux had the best of his enemy: "Marriage, do you
understand this?" he remarks. "Marriage cures them of this faculty of
climbing dead-walls like so many flies, and of speaking foreign
languages. Oh! the curious properties of marriage in those remarkable
days!"

"It should be added," continues Figuier, "that with the fanatics of St.
Medard, the blows were never administered except during the convulsive
crisis; and that, therefore, as Dr. Calmeil suggests, meteorism of the
abdomen, the *state of spasm* of the uterus of women, of the alimentary
canal in all cases, the state of *contraction, of erethism, of
turgescence of the carneous envelopes of the muscular coats* which
protect and cover the abdomen, chest, and principal vascular masses and
the osseous surfaces, *may have singularly contributed toward reducing,
and even destroying,* the force of the blows!"

"The astounding resistance that the skin, the areolar tissue, the
surface of the bodies and limbs of the Convulsionnaires offered to
things which seem as if they ought to have torn or crushed them, is of a
nature to excite more surprise. Nevertheless, it can be explained. This
resisting force, this insensibility, seems to partake of the extreme
changes in sensibility which can occur in the animal economy during a
time of great exaltation. Anger, fear, in a word, every passion,
provided that it be carried to a paroxysmal point, can produce this
insensibility." <span id="fr_559"></span>[\*\*](#fn_558.md)

"Let us remark, besides," rejoins Dr. Calmeil, quoted by Figuier, "that
for striking upon the bodies of the Convulsionnaires use was made either
of massive objects with flat or rounded surfaces, or of cylindrical and
blunt shapes. <span id="fr_560"></span>[\*\*\*](#fn_559.md) The action of
such physical agents is not to be compared, in respect to the danger
which attaches to it, with that of cords, supple or flexible
instruments, and those having a sharp edge. In fine, the contact and the
shock of the blows produced upon the Convulsionnaires *the effect of a
salutary shampooing,* and reduced the violence of the tortures of
HYSTERIA."

The reader will please observe that this is not intended as a joke, but
is the sober theory of one of the most eminent of French physicians,
hoary with age and experience, the Director-in-Chief of the Government
Insane Asylum at Charenton. Really, the above explanation might lead the
reader to a strange suspicion. We might imagine, perhaps, that Dr.

###### <span id="page_376">p. 376</span>

Calmeil has kept company with the patients under his care a few more
years than was good for the healthy action of his own brain.

Besides, when Figuier talks of massive objects, of cylindrical and blunt
shapes, he surely forgets the sharp swords, pointed iron pegs, and the
hatchets, of which he himself gave a graphic description on page 409 of
his first volume. The brother of Elie Marion is shown by him striking
his stomach and abdomen with the sharp point of a knife, with tremendous
force, "his body all the while resisting as if it were made of iron."

Arrived at this point, des Mousseaux loses all patience, and indignantly
exclaims:

"Was the learned physician quite awake when writing the above sentences?
. . . If, perchance, the Drs. Calmeil and Figuier should seriously
maintain their assertions and insist on their theory, we are ready to
answer them as follows: 'We are perfectly willing to believe you. But
before such a superhuman effort of condescension, will you not
demonstrate to us the truth of your theory in a more practical manner?
Let us, for example, develop in you a violent and terrible passion;
anger--rage if you choose. You shall permit us for a single moment to be
in your sight irritating, rude, and insulting. Of course, we will be so
only at *your request* and in the interest of science and your cause.
Our duty under the contract will consist in humiliating and provoking
you to the last extremity. Before a public audience, who shall know
nothing of our agreement, but whom you must satisfy as to your
assertions, we will insult you; . . . we will tell you that your
writings are an ambuscade to truth, an insult to common sense, a
disgrace which paper only can bear; but which the public should
chastise. We will add that *you lie to science,* you lie to the ears of
the ignorant and stupid fools gathered around you, open-mouthed, like
the crowd around a peddling quack. . . . And when, transported beyond
yourself, your face ablaze, and anger *tumefying,* you shall have
*displaced your fluids;* when your fury has reached the point of
bursting, we will cause your *turgescent* muscles to be struck with
powerful blows; your friends shall show us the most insensible places;
we will let a perfect shower, an avalanche of stones fall upon them . .
. for so was treated the flesh of the convulsed women whose appetite for
such blows could never be satisfied. But, in order to procure for you
the gratification of *a salutary shampooing--*as you deliciously express
it--your limbs shall only be pounded with objects having *blunt surfaces
and cylindrical shapes,* with clubs and sticks devoid of suppleness,
and, if you prefer it, neatly turned in a lathe.' "

So liberal is des Mousseaux, so determined to accommodate his
antagonists with every possible chance to prove their theory, that he
offers them

###### <span id="page_377">p. 377</span>

the choice to substitute for themselves in the experiment their wives,
mothers, daughters, and sisters, "since," he says, "you have remarked
that the weaker sex is the strong and resistant sex in these
disconcerting trials."

Useless to remark that des Mousseaux's challenge remained unanswered.

<span id="fn_508"></span>[343:\*\*](iu009.htm#fr_509.md) The most positive
of materialistic philosophers agree that all that exists was evolved
from ether; hence, air, water, earth, and fire, the four primordial
elements must also proceed from ether and chaos the first *Duad;* all
the imponderables, whether now known or unknown, proceed from the same
source. Now, if there is a spiritual essence in matter, and that essence
forces it to shape itself into millions of individual forms, why is it
illogical to assert that each of these spiritual kingdoms in nature is
peopled with beings evolved out of its own material? Chemistry teaches
us that in man's body there are air, water, earth, and heat, or
fire--*air* is present in its components; *water* in the secretions;
*earth* in the inorganic constituents; and *fire* in the animal heat.
The Kabalist knows by experience that an elemental spirit contains only
one, and that each one of the four kingdoms has its own peculiar
elemental spirits; man being higher than they, the law of evolution
finds its illustration in the combination of all four in him.

("Classical Dictionary," art. "Pythagoras") says that "there is great
reason to suspect the truth of the whole narrative of Pythagoras'
journey into India," and concludes by saying that this philosopher had
never seen either Gymnosophists or their country. If this be so, how
account for the doctrine of the metempsychosis of Pythagoras, which is
far more that of the Hindu in its details than the Egyptian? But, above
all, how account for the fact that the name **M**ONAS, applied by him to
the First Cause, is the identical appellation given to that Being in the
Sanscrit tongue? In 1792-7, when Lempriere's "Dictionary" appeared, the
Sanscrit was, we may say, utterly unknown; Dr. Haug's translation of the
"Aitareya Brahmana" ("Rig-Vedas"), in which this word occurs, was
published only about *twenty* years ago, and until that valuable
addition to the literature of archaic ages was completed, and the
precise age of the "Aitareya"--now fixed by Haug at 2000-2400 B.C.--was
a mystery, it might be suggested, as in the case of Christian symbols,
that the Hindus *borrowed* it from Pythagoras. But now, unless philology
can show it to be a "coincidence," and that the word *Monas* is not the
same in its minutest definitions, we have a right to assert that
Pythagoras was in India, and that it was the Gymnosophists who
instructed him <span id="page_348">p. 348</span> in his metaphysical
theology. The fact alone that "Sanscrit, as compared with Greek and
Latin, is an elder sister," as Max Muller shows, is not sufficient to
account for the perfect identity of the Sanscrit and Greek words
**M**ONAS, in their most metaphysical, abstruse sense. The Sanscrit word
Deva (god) has become the Latin *deus*, and points to a common source;
but we see in the Zoroastrian "Zend-Avesta" the same word, meaning
diametrically the opposite, and becoming *daeva*, or evil spirit, from
which comes the word *devil*.

being contradicted by some spiritualists we give verbatim the language
in question, as a specimen of the unreliability of the oracular
utterances of certain "spirits." Let them be human or elemental, but
spirits capable of such effrontery may well be regarded by occultists as
anything but safe guides in philosophy, exact science, or ethics. "It
will be remembered," says Mrs. Cora V. Tappan, in a public discourse
upon the "History of Occultism and its Relations to Spiritualism" (see
"Banner of Light," Aug. 26, 1876), "that the ancient word witchcraft, or
the exercise of it, was forbidden among the Hebrews. The translation is
that no witch should be allowed to live. That has been supposed to be
the literal interpretation; and acting upon that, your very pious and
devout ancestors put to death, without adequate testimony, numbers of
very intelligent, wise, and sincere persons, under the condemnation of
witchcraft. It has now turned out that the interpretation or translation
should be, that no witches should be allowed to obtain a living by the
practice of their art. That is, it should not be made a profession." May
we be so bold as to inquire of the celebrated speaker, through *whom or
according to what* authority such a thing has ever *turned out*?

Britain, which is reported in the "Spiritualist" (London, April 14,
1876, pp. 174, 175). He thought that the effect of free nitric acid in
the atmosphere was able to drive away what he calls "unpleasant
spirits." He thought that those who were troubled by unpleasant spirits
at home, would find relief by pouring one ounce of vitriol upon two
ounces of finely-powdered nitre in a saucer and putting the mixture
under the bed. Here is a scientist, whose reputation extends over two
continents, who gives a recipe to drive away bad spirits. And yet the
general public mocks as a "*superstition*" the herbs and incenses
employed by Hindus, Chinese, Africans, and other races to accomplish the
self-same purpose.

possible," he says, "that my spirit, without the help of the body, and
through a fiery will alone, and without a sword, can stab and wound
others. It is also possible that I can bring the spirit of my adversary
into an image, and then double him up and lame him . . . the exertion of
will is a great point in medicine. . . . Every imagination of man comes
through the heart, for this is the sun of the microcosm, and out of the
microcosm proceeds the imagination into the great world (universal
ether) . . . the imagination of man is a seed which is *material*." (Our
atomical modern scientists have proved it; see Babbage and Professor
Jevons.) "Fixed thought is also a means to an end. The magical is a
great *concealed wisdom,* and reason is a great public foolishness. No
armor protects against magic, for it injures the *inward* spirit of
life."
