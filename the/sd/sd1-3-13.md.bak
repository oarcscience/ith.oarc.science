#### XIII. SCIENTIFIC AND ESOTERIC EVIDENCE FOR, AND OBJECTIONS TO, THE MODERN NEBULAR THEORY.

**O**F late Esoteric Cosmogony has been frequently opposed by the
phantom of this theory and its ensuing hypotheses. "Can this most
scientific teaching be denied by your adepts?" it is asked. "Not
entirely," is the reply, "but the admissions of the men of Science
themselves *kill* it; and there remains nothing for the adepts to deny."

To make of Science an integral *whole* necessitates, indeed, the study
of spiritual and psychic, as well as physical Nature. Otherwise it will
ever be like the anatomy of man, discussed of old by the profane from
the point of view of his shell-side and in ignorance of the interior
work. Even Plato, the greatest philosopher of his country, became
guilty, before his initiation, of such statements as that liquids pass
into the stomach through the lungs. Without metaphysics, as Mr. H. J.
Slack says, *real* science is inadmissible.

The nebulae exist; yet the nebular theory is wrong. A nebula exists in a
state of entire elemental dissociation. It *is* gaseous and -- something
else besides, which can hardly be connected with gases, as known to
physical science; and it *is* self-luminous. But that is all. The
sixty-two "coincidences" enumerated by Professor Stephen Alexander,\*
confirming the nebular theory, may all be explained by esoteric science;
though, as this is not an astronomical work, the refutations are not
attempted at present. Laplace and Faye come nearer to the correct theory
than any; but of the speculations of Laplace there remains little in the
present theory except its general features. Nevertheless, "there is in
Laplace's theory," says John Stuart Mill, "*nothing hypothetical*; it is
an example of legitimate reasoning from present effect to its past
cause; it assumes nothing more than that objects which really exist,
obey the laws which are known to be obeyed by all terrestrial objects
resembling them." (*System of Logic*, p. 229).

This from such an eminent logician as Mill was, would be valuable, if it
could only be proved that "terrestrial objects *resembling .* . ."
celestial objects at such a distance as the nebulae are -- *resemble
those objects in reality*, *not alone in appearance.*

Another of the fallacies from the Occult stand-point, which are embodied
in the modern theory as it now stands, is the hypothesis that the
planets were all detached from the Sun; that they are bone of

his bone, and flesh of his flesh; whereas, the Sun and planets are only
co-uterine brothers, having had the same nebular origin, only in a
different mode from that postulated by modern astronomy.

The many objections raised against the homogeneity of original diffuse
matter, on the ground of the uniformity in the composition of the fixed
stars, by some opponents of the modern nebular theory, do not affect the
question of that homogeneity at all, but only the said theory. Our solar
nebula may not be completely homogeneous, or, rather, it may fail to
reveal itself as such to the astronomers, and yet be *de facto*
homogeneous. The stars do differ in their constituent materials and even
exhibit elements quite unknown on earth; nevertheless, this does not
affect the point that primeval matter -- *i.e.*, as it *appeared even in
its first* differentiation from its *laya* condition\* -- is yet to this
day homogeneous, at immense distances, in the depths of infinitude, and
likewise at points not far removed from the outskirts of our solar
system.

Finally, there does not exist one single fact brought forward by the
learned objectors against the "nebular theory," (false as it is, and
hence, *illogically enough*, fatal to the hypothesis of the homogeneity
of matter,) that can withstand criticism. One error leads into another.
A false premise will naturally lead to a false conclusion, although an
inadmissible inference does not *necessarily* affect the validity of the
major proposition of the syllogism. Thus, one may leave every side-issue
and inference from the evidence of spectra, and lines, as simply
provisional for the present, and abandon all matters of detail to
physical science. The duty of the Occultist lies with the *Soul and
Spirit* of Cosmic Space, not merely with its illusive appearance and
behaviour. That of official physical science is to analyze and study its
*shell* -- the *Ultima Thule* of the Universe and man, in the opinion of
Materialism.

With the latter, Occultism has nought to do. It is only with the
theories of such men of learning as Kepler, Kant, Oersted, and Sir W.
Herschell, who believed in a Spiritual world, that Occult Cosmogony
might treat, and attempt a satisfactory compromise. But the views of
those physicists differed vastly from the latest modern speculations.
Kant and Herschell had in their mind's eye speculations upon the origin
and *the final destiny*, as well as the present aspect, of the Universe,
from a far more philosophical and psychic standpoint; whereas modern
Cosmology and Astronomy now repudiate anything like research into the
mysteries of being. The result is what might be expected: complete
failure and inextricable contradictions in the thousand and one
varieties of so-called scientific theories, and in this theory as in all
others.

The nebular hypothesis, involving the theory of the existence of a

###### \[\[Footnote(s)\]\] -------------------------------------------------

\* Beyond the zero-line of action.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

###### \[\[Vol. 1, Page\]\] 590 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.

primeval matter, diffused in a nebulous condition, is of no modern date
in astronomy as everyone knows. Anaximenes, of the Ionian school, had
already taught that the sidereal bodies were formed through the
progressive condensation of a primordial *pregenetic* matter, which had
almost a negative weight, and was spread out through Space in an
extremely sublimated condition.

Tycho Brahe, who viewed the Milky Way as an ethereal substance, thought
the new star that appeared in Cassiopoeia, in 1572, had been formed out
of that matter. ("*Progymnasmata*" p. 795.) Kepler believed the star of
1606 had been likewise formed out of the ethereal substance that fills
the universe ("*De stella nova in pede Serpentarii*," p*.* 115). He
attributed to that same ether the apparition of a luminous ring around
the moon, during the total eclipse of the sun observed at Naples in
1605*.* ("*Hypotheses Cosmogoniques*," *C. Wolf.*) Still later, in 1714,
-- the existence of a self-luminous matter was recognised by Halley
("*Philosophical Transactions*")*.* Finally, the journal of this name
published in 1811 the famous hypothesis on the transformation of the
nebulae into stars, by the eminent astronomer, Sir W. Herschell (*See*
"*Philosophical Transactions*," *of* 1811, p. 269, *et seq.*), after
which the nebular theory was accepted by the Royal Academies.

In "Five years of Theosophy," on p. 245, an article headed "*Do* *the
Adepts deny the Nebular Theory?*" may be read. The answer there given is
"No; they do not deny *its general propositions*, *nor the approximative
truth of the scientific* hypotheses. They only deny the *completeness*
of the present, as well as the entire error of the many so-called
"exploded" old theories, which, during the last century, have followed
each other in such rapid succession."

This was proclaimed at the time "an evasive answer." Such disrespect to
official science, it was argued, must be justified by the presentation,
to replace the *orthodox* speculation, of another theory more complete
than theirs, and having a firmer ground to stand upon. To this there is
but one reply; it is useless to give out isolated theories with regard
to things embodied in a whole and consecutive system, which, when
separated from the main body of the teaching, would necessarily lose
their vital coherence and thus do no good when studied independently. To
be able to appreciate and accept the occult views on the nebular theory,
one has to study the whole esoteric cosmogonical system. And the time
has hardly arrived for the astronomers to be asked to accept *Fohat* and
the divine Builders. Even the undeniably correct surmises of Sir W.
Herschell\], that had nothing "supernatural" in them, about the sun
being called "*globe of fire*" (perhaps) *metaphorically*, and his early
speculations about the nature of that which is now called the Nasmyth
willow-leaf theory -- caused that most eminent of all astro-

###### \[\[Vol. 1, Page\]\] 591 FORCES ARE EMANATIONS.

nomers to be smiled at by other, far less eminent colleagues, who saw
and now see in his ideas only "imaginative and fanciful theories."
Before the whole esoteric system could be given out and appreciated by
the astronomers, they would have to return to some of those "antiquated
ideas," not only to those of Herschell, but to the dreams of the oldest
Hindu astronomers, and to abandon their own theories, none the less
"fanciful" because they have appeared in one case nearly 80 years and in
the other many thousands of years later. Foremost of all they would have
to repudiate the ideas on the Sun's *solidity* and *incandescence;* the
sun "glowing" most undeniably, but not "burning." Then it is stated,
with regard to Sir W. Herschell's view that those "objects," as he
called the "willow leaves," are the immediate *sources* *of the solar
light and heat.* And though the esoteric teaching does not regard these
as he did -- namely, *organisms* as partaking of the nature of life,"
for the Solar "Beings" will hardly place themselves within telescopic
focus -- yet it asserts that the whole Universe is full of such
"organisms," conscious and active according to the proximity or distance
of their planes to, or from, our plane of consciousness; and that
finally the great astronomer was right in saying that "we do not know
that vital action is competent to develop at once heat, light, and
electricity" while speculating on those supposed "organisms." For, at
the risk of being laughed at by the whole world of physicists, the
Occultists maintain that all the "Forces" of the Scientists have their
origin in the *Vital Principle*, the ONE LIFE collectively of our Solar
system -- that "*life*" being a portion, or rather one of the *aspects*
of the One Universal LIFE.

We may, therefore, as in the article under consideration, wherein, on
the authority of the Adepts, it was maintained that it is "sufficient to
make a *resume* of what the solar physicists *do not know*," -- we may,
we maintain, define our position with regard to the modern nebular
theory and its evident incorrectness, by simply pointing out facts
diametrically opposed to it in its present form. And to begin with, what
does it teach?

Summarizing the aforesaid hypotheses, it becomes plain that Laplace's
theory -- now made quite unrecognisable, moreover -- was an unfortunate
one. He postulates in the first place Cosmic matter, existing in a state
of diffuse nebulosity "so fine that its presence could hardly have been
suspected." No attempt is made by him to penetrate into the arcana of
being, except as regards the immediate evolution of our small solar
system.

Consequently, whether one accepts or rejects his theory in its bearing
upon the immediate cosmological problems presented for solution, he can
only be said to have thrown back the mystery a little further. To the
eternal query -- "Whence matter itself; whence the evolutionary impetus

###### \[\[Vol. 1, Page\]\] 592 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.

determining its cyclic aggregations and dissolutions; whence the
exquisite symmetry and order into which the primeval atoms arrange and
group themselves?" -- no answer is attempted by Laplace. All we are
confronted with, is a sketch of the *probable* broad principles on which
the actual process is assumed to be based. Well, and what is this now
celebrated note on the said process? What has he given so wonderfully
new and original, that its ground-work, at any rate, should have served
as a basis for the modern nebular theory? This is what one gathers from
various astronomical works.

Laplace thought that, consequent on the condensation of the atoms of the
primeval nebula, according to the "Law" of gravity, the now gaseous, or
perhaps, partially liquid mass, acquired a rotatory motion. As the
velocity of this rotation increased, it assumed the form of a thin disc;
finally, the centrifugal force overpowering that of cohesion, huge rings
were detached from the edge of the whirling incandescent masses,
contracting necessarily by gravitation (as accepted) into spheroidal
bodies, which would necessarily still continue to preserve the same
orbit occupied previously by the outer zone from which they were
separated. ("Laplace conceived that the external and internal zones of
the ring would rotate with the same angular velocity, which would be the
case with a solid ring; but the principle of equal areas requires the
inner zones to rotate more rapidly than the outer.")\* The velocity of
the outer edge of each nascent planet, he said, exceeding that of the
inner, there results a rotation on its axis. The more dense bodies would
be thrown off last; and finally, during the preliminary state of their
formation, the newly-segregated orbs in their turn throw off one or more
satellites . . . In formulating the history of the rupture and
planetation of rings, Laplace says:

> "Almost always each ring of vapours must have broken up into numerous
> masses, which, moving with a nearly uniform velocity, must have
> continued to circulate at the same distance around the Sun. These
> masses must have taken a spheroidal form with a motion of rotation in
> the same direction as their revolution, since the inner molecules
> (those nearer to the Sun) would have less actual velocity than the
> exterior ones. They must then have formed as many planets in a state
> of vapour. But, if one of them was sufficiently powerful to unite
> successively, by its attraction, all the others around its centre, the
> ring of vapours must have been thus transformed into a single
> spheroidal mass of vapours circulating around the Sun with a rotation
> in the same direction as its revolution. The latter case has been the
> more common, but the solar system presents us the first case, in the
> four small planets which move between Jupiter and Mars."

While few will be found to deny "the magnificent audacity of this

hypothesis," it is impossible not to recognise the insurmountable
difficulties with which it is attended. Why, for instance, do we find
that the satellites of Neptune and Uranus display a retrograde motion;
that, in spite of its closer proximity to the Sun, Venus is less dense
than the Earth? Similarly, the more distant Uranus is more dense than
Saturn? How is it that so many variations in the inclination of their
axes and orbits are present in the supposed progeny of the central orb;
that such startling variations in the size of the planets is noticeable;
that the Satellites of Jupiter are more dense by .288 than their primary
-- that the phenomena of meteoric and cometic systems still remain
unaccounted for? To quote the words of a Master: "They (the Occultists)
find that the centrifugal theory of Western birth is unable to cover
*all* the ground. That, unaided, it can neither account for every oblate
spheroid, nor explain away such evident difficulties as are presented by
the relative density of some planets. How, indeed, can any calculation
of centrifugal force explain to us, for instance, why Mercury, whose
rotation is, we are told, only about one-third that of the Earth, and
its density only about one-fourth greater than the Earth, should have a
polar compression *more than ten times as great as the latter?* And
again, why Jupiter, whose equatorial rotation is said to be
'twenty-seven times greater, and its density only about one-fifth that
of the earth' should have its polar compression seventeen times greater
than that of the earth? Or why Saturn, with an equatorial velocity
fifty-five times greater than Mercury for centripetal force to contend
with, should have its polar compression *only three times* greater than
Mercury's? To crown the above contradictions, we are asked to believe in
the Central Forces, as taught by Modern Science, even when told that the
equatorial matter of the Sun, with more than four times the centrifugal
velocity of the Earth's equatorial surface, and only about one-fourth
part of the gravitation of the equatorial matter, has not manifested any
tendency to bulge at the Solar equator, nor shown the least flattening
of the poles of the Solar axis. In other and clearer words, the Sun,
with only one fourth of our Earth's density for the centrifugal force to
work upon, has no polar compression at all! We find this objection made
by more than one astronomer, yet never explained away satisfactorily so
far as the 'Adepts' are aware."

"Therefore, do they (the Adepts) say, that the great men of science of
the West, knowing . . . . . next to nothing either about cometary
matter, centrifugal and centripetal forces, the nature of the nebulae,
or the physical constitution of the Sun, the Stars, or even the Moon,
are imprudent to speak as confidently as they do about the 'central mass
of the Sun' whirling out into space planets, comets, and what not . . .

Soul of those bodies, *giving and receiving* it back, in our solar
system, as the 'Universal Life-Giver' . . . . in infinitude and
Eternity; that the solar system is as much the *microcosm* of the ONE
Macrocosm as man is the former when compared with his own little Solar
Cosmos."\*

The essential faculty possessed by all the cosmic and terrestrial
elements, of generating within themselves a regular and harmonious
series of results, a concatenation of causes and effects, is an
irrefutable proof that they are either animated by an *extra* or *intra*
INTELLIGENCE, or conceal such within or behind the *manifested veil.*
Occultism does not deny the certainty of the mechanical origin of the
Universe; it only claims the absolute necessity of mechanicians of some
sort behind those Elements (or *within*) -- a dogma with us. It is not
the fortuitous assistance of the atoms of Lucretius, who himself knew
better, that built the Kosmos and all in it. Nature herself contradicts
such a theory. Celestial space, containing matter so attenuated as is
Ether, cannot be called on, with or without attraction, to explain the
common motion of the sidereal hosts. Although the perfect accord of
their mutual revolution indicates clearly the presence of a mechanical
cause in Nature, Newton, who of all men had best right to trust to his
deductions and views, was nevertheless forced to abandon the idea of
ever explaining, by the laws of *known* Nature and its Material forces,
the original impulse given to the millions of orbs. He recognised fully
the limits that separate the action of natural Forces from that of the
**I**NTELLIGENCES that set the immutable laws into order and action. And
if a **N**EWTON had to renounce such hope, which of the modern
materialistic pigmies has the right of saying: "I know better"?

To become complete and comprehensible, a cosmogonical theory has to
start with a primordial Substance diffused throughout boundless Space,
*of an intellectual and divine Nature.* That substance must be the Soul
and Spirit, the Synthesis and *Seventh Principle* of the manifested
Kosmos, and, to serve as a spiritual *Upadhi* to this, there must be the
sixth, its vehicle -- *primordial physical matter*, so to speak, though
its nature must escape for ever our limited *normal* senses. It is easy
for an astronomer, if endowed with an imaginative faculty, to build a
theory of the emergence of the universe out of chaos, by simply applying
to it the principles of mechanics. But such a universe will always
prove, with respect to its scientific human creator, a Frankenstein's
monster; it will lead him into endless perplexities. The application of
the mechanical laws only can never carry the speculator beyond the
objective world; nor will it unveil to men the origin and final destiny
of Kosmos. This is

###### \[\[Vol. 1, Page\]\] 595 WHAT ARE THE NEBULAE?

whither the nebular theory has led Science. In sober fact and truth this
theory is twin sister to that of Ether, and both are the offsprings of
necessity; one as indispensable to account for the transmission of
light, as the other to explain the problem of the origin of the solar
systems. The question with them is, how the same homogeneous matter\*
could, obeying the laws of Newton, give birth to bodies -- sun, planets,
and their satellites -- subject to conditions of identity of motion and
formed of such heterogeneous elements.

Has the nebular theory helped to solve the problem, even if applied
solely to bodies considered as inanimate and material? We say most
decidedly not. What progress has it made since 1811, when Sir W.
Herschell's paper, first presenting facts based on observation and
showing the existence of nebular matter, made the "Sons" of the Royal
Society "shout for joy"? Since then a still greater discovery has
permitted, through spectrum analysis, the verification and corroboration
of Sir W. Herschell's conjecture. Laplace demanded some kind of
primitive "world stuff " to prove the idea of progressive
world-evolution and growth. Here it is, as offered two millenniums ago.

The "world stuff," now *nebulae*, was known from the highest antiquity.
Anaxagoras taught that, having differentiated, the subsequent commixture
of heterogeneous substances remained motionless and unorganized, until
finally "the Mind" -- the collective body of Dhyan Chohans, we say --
began to work upon and communicated to it motion and order
(*Aristotle*'*s* "*Physica*," *viii*, 1*.*) The theory is now taken up
in its first portion, that of *any* "Mind" interfering with it being
rejected. Spectrum analysis reveals the existence of nebulae formed
entirely of gases and luminous vapours. Is this the primitive nebular
matter? The spectra reveal, it is said, the physical conditions of the
matter which emits cosmic light. The spectra of the resolvable and the
irresolvable nebulae are shown to be entirely different, the spectra of
the latter showing their physical state to be that of glowing gas or
vapour. The bright lines of one nebula reveal the existence of hydrogen
in it, and of other material substances known and unknown. The same in
the atmospheres of the Sun and stars. This leads to the direct inference
that a star is formed by the condensation of a nebula; hence that even
the metals themselves on earth are

\* Had astronomers held simply, in their present state of knowledge, to
the hypothesis of Laplace, which was simply the formation of the
planetary system, it might in time have resulted in something like an
approximate truth. But the two parts of the general problem, that of the
formation of the universe, or the formation of the suns and stars from
the primitive matter, and then the development of the planets around
their sun, rest on quite different facts in nature and are even so
viewed by Science itself. They are at the opposite poles of being.

###### \[\[Vol. 1, Page\]\] 596 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.

formed owing to the condensation of hydrogen or some other primitive
matter, some ancestral cousin to "helium," perhaps, or some yet unknown
stuff? *This does not clash with the occult teachings.* And this is the
problem that chemistry is trying to solve; and it must succeed sooner or
later in the task, accepting *nolens volens*, when it does, the esoteric
teaching. But when this does happen, it will kill the nebular theory as
it now stands.

Meanwhile Astronomy cannot accept in any way, if it is to be regarded as
*an exact* science, the present theory of the filiation of stars -- even
if occultism does so in its own way, as it explains this filiation
differently -- because astronomy has *not one single physical datum* to
show for it. Astronomy could anticipate Chemistry in proving the
existence of the fact, if it could show a planetary nebula exhibiting a
spectrum of three or four bright lines, gradually condensing and
transforming into a star, with a spectrum all covered with a number of
dark lines. But "the question of the variability of the nebula, even as
to their form, is yet one of the mysteries of Astronomy. The data of
observation possessed so far are of too recent an origin, too uncertain
to permit us to affirm anything*.*" (*Cosmogonical Hypotheses of Wolf.*)

Since the discovery of the spectroscope, its magic power has revealed to
its adepts only one single transformation of a star of this kind; and
even that one showed directly the reverse of what is needed as proof in
favour of the nebular theory; namely -- *a star transforming itself into
a planetary nebula.* As told in *The Observatory* (*Vol. I.*, *p.* 185),
the temporary star which appeared in the constellation Cygnus, in
November, 1876, discovered by J. F. J. Schmidt, exhibited a spectrum
broken by very brilliant lines. Gradually, the continuous spectrum and
most of the lines disappeared, leaving finally one single brilliant
line, which appeared to coincide with the green line of the nebula.

Though this metamorphosis is not irreconcileable with the hypothesis of
the nebular origin of the stars, nevertheless this single solitary case
rests on no observation whatever, least of all on direct observation.
The occurrence may have been due to several other causes. Since
astronomers are inclined to think our planets are tending toward
precipitation on the Sun, why should not that star have blazed out owing
to a collision of such precipitated planets, or, as many suggest, the
appulse of a comet? Anyhow, the only known instance of a star
transformation since 1811 is not favourable to the nebular theory.
Moreover, on the question of this theory, as in all others, astronomers
disagree.

In our own age, it was Buffon, before Laplace ever thought of it, who,
very much struck by the identity of motion in the planets, was the first
to propose the hypothesis of the planets and their satellites
originating in

------------------------------------------------------------------------

###### \[\[Vol. 1, Page\]\] 597 THE META-ELEMENTS OF PHYSICAL SCIENCE.

the bosom of the Sun. Forthwith, and for the purpose, he invented a
special comet, supposed to have torn out, by a powerful oblique blow,
the quantity of matter necessary to their formation. Laplace gave its
dues to the "comet" in his "*Exposition du Systeme du Monde.*" (Note
VII.) But the idea was seized and even improved upon by a conception of
the alternate evolution from the Sun's central mass of planets
*apparently* without weight or influence on the motion of the visible
planets -- and as evidently without any more existence than the likeness
of Moses in the moon.

But the modern theory is also a variation on the systems elaborated by
Kant and Laplace. The idea of both was that, at the origin of things,
all that matter which now enters into the composition of the planetary
bodies was spread over all the space comprised in the solar system --
and even beyond. It was a nebula of extremely small density, whose
condensation gradually gave birth, by a mechanism that has hitherto
never been explained, to the various bodies of our systems. This is the
original nebular theory, an *incomplete* yet faithful repetition -- a
short chapter out of the large volume of universal *esoteric* cosmogony
-- of the teachings in the Secret Doctrine. And both systems, Kant's and
Laplace's, differ greatly from the modern theory, redundant with
conflicting *sub*-theories and fanciful hypotheses.

"*The essence of cometary matter and of that which composes the stars is
totally different from any of the chemical or physical characteristics*
*with which Western Science is now acquainted.* While the spectroscope
has shown the probable similarity (owing *to the chemical action of
terrestrial light* upon the intercepted rays) of earthly and sidereal
substance, the chemical actions, peculiar to the variously progressed
orbs of space, have not been detected, nor proven to be identical with
those observed on our own planet" -- say the Teachers (*op. cit.*)*.*
Mr. Crookes says almost the same in the fragment quoted from his
lecture, "*Elements and Meta-Elements.*"

difficulty arising for them out of such undeniable variety and
heterogeneity of matter in the constitution of nebulae, did admit, with
the ancients, that the origin of all the visible and invisible heavenly
bodies must be sought for in one primordial homogeneous world-stuff, in
a kind of PRE-*protyle*,\* -- it is evident that this would not put an
end to their perplexities. Unless they admit also that our actual
visible Universe is merely the *Sthula*-*Sharira*, the gross body, of
the sevenfold Kosmos, they will have to face another problem; especially
if they risk maintaining that its now visible bodies are the result of
the condensation of that one and single primordial matter. For mere
observation shows them that the actions which produced the actual
Universe are far more complex than could ever be embraced in that
theory.

First of all, there are two distinct classes of *irresolvable* nebulae,
-- as Science itself teaches.

The telescope is unable to distinguish between the two, but the
spectroscope can, and notices, therefore, an essential difference
between their physical constitutions.\*\*

"Some of these," Wolf tells us, "have a spectrum of three or four bright
lines, others a continuous spectrum. The first are gaseous, the others
formed of a pulverulent matter. The former must constitute a veritable
atmosphere: it is among these that the solar nebula of Laplace has to be
placed. The latter form an *ensemble* of particles that may be
considered as independent, and the rotation of which obeys the laws of

\* Mr. Crookes' "Protyle" must not be regarded as the *primary* stuff,
out of which the Dhyan Chohans, in accordance with the immutable laws of
nature, wove our solar system. This *protyle* cannot even be the first
*prima*-*materia* of Kant, which that great mind saw used up in the
formation of the worlds, and thus existing no longer in a diffused
state. It is a MEDIATE phase in the progressive differentiation of
cosmic substance from its normal undifferentiated state. *Protyle* is
then the aspect assumed by matter in its middle passage into full
objectivity.

\*\* "The question of the resolvability of the nebulae has been often
presented in too affirmative a manner and quite contrary to the ideas
expressed by the illustrious experimenter with the spectra of these
constellations -- Mr. Huggins. Every nebula whose spectrum contains only
bright lines is gaseous, it is said, and hence is irresolvable; every
nebula with a continuous spectrum must end by resolving into stars with
an instrument of sufficient power. This assumption is contrary at once
to the results obtained, and to spectroscopic theory. The *Lyra* nebula,
the *Dumb*-*bell* nebula, the central region of the nebula of Orion,
appear resolvable, and show a spectrum of bright lines; the nebula of
*Canis Venatici* is not resolvable, and gives a continuous spectrum.
Because, indeed, the spectroscope informs us of the physical state of
the constituent matter of the stars, but affords us no notions of their
modes of aggregation. A nebula formed of gaseous globes (or even of
nuclei, faintly luminous, surrounded by a powerful atmosphere) would
give a spectrum of lines and be still resolvable; such seems to be the
state of Huggins' region in the Orion nebula. A nebula formed of solid
or fluidic particles in a state of incandescence, a true cloud, will
give a continuous spectrum but will be *irresolvable.*" (*C. Wolf*,
*Cosmogonical Hypotheses.*)

internal weight: such are the nebulae adopted by Kant and Faye.
Observation allows us to place the one as the other at the very origin
of the planetary world. But when we try to go beyond and ascend to the
primitive chaos which has produced the totality of the heavenly bodies,
we have first to account for the actual existence of these two classes
of nebulae. If the primitive chaos were *a cold luminous gas*,\* one
could understand how the contraction resulting from attraction could
have heated it and made it luminous. We have to explain the condensation
of this gas to the state of incandescent particles, the presence of
which is revealed to us in certain nebulae by the spectroscope. If the
original chaos was composed of such particles, how did certain of their
portions pass into the gaseous state, while others have preserved their
primitive condition? . . . ."

Such is the synopsis of the objections and difficulties to the
acceptance of the nebular theory brought forward by the French *savant*,
who concludes his interesting chapter by declaring that: --

"The first part of the Cosmogonical problem, -- what is the primitive
matter of chaos; and how did that matter give birth to the sun and
stars? -- thus remains to this day in THE DOMAIN OF ROMANCE AND OF MERE
IMAGINATION."\*\*

If this is the last word of Science upon that subject, whither then
should one turn in order to learn what the nebular theory is supposed to
teach? What, in fact, is this theory? What it *is*, no one seems to know
for a certainty. What it *is not* -- we learn from the erudite author of
the "World-Life." He tells us that: --

(I.) It "*is not a theory of the evolution* of the Universe . . . but
only and primarily a genetic explanation of the phenomena of the solar
system, and accessorily a co-ordination of the principal phenomena in
the stellar and nebular firmament, *as far as human vision has been able
to penetrate.*"

(II.) "That it does not regard the Comets as involved in that particular
evolution which has produced the solar system." (*Esoteric doctrine
does.*)

(It does, because it, too, recognises the comets as forms of cosmic
existence *co*-*ordinated with earlier stages of nebular evolution;* and
it actually assigns *to them chiefly* the formation of all worlds.)

(III.) "*That it does not deny an antecedent history of the luminous
fire mist*" -- (the *secondary* stage of evolution in the Secret
Doctrine) . . . . "and makes no claim to having reached an absolute
beginning." And even

\* See Stanza III. about "Light, or the *cold* Flame," and Commentary
Number 8, where it is explained that the "mother" (Chaos) is a cold
Fire, a cool Radiance, colourless, formless, devoid of every quality.
"Motion is the One Eternal *is*, and contains the potentialities of
every quality in the Manvantaric Worlds," it is said.

it allows that this "fire mist may have previously existed in a cold,
nonluminous and *invisible* condition" . . . .

(IV.) "And that finally: it does not profess to discover the ORIGIN of
things, *but only a stadium in material history*" . . . . leaving "the
philosopher and theologian as free as they ever were to seek for the
origin of the modes of being."\*

But this is not all. Even the greatest philosopher of England -- Mr.
Herbert Spencer -- arrayed himself against the fantastic theory by
saying that (*a*) "The problem of existence is not resolved" by it;
(*b*) the nebular hypothesis "throws no light upon the origin of
diffused matter," and (*c*) that "the nebular hypothesis (as it now
stands) implies a First Cause."\*\*

The latter, we are afraid, is more than our modern physicists have
bargained for. Thus, it seems that the poor "hypothesis" can hardly
expect to find help or corroboration even in the world of the
metaphysicians.

Considering all this, the Occultists believe they have a right to
present *their* philosophy, however misunderstood and ostracised it may
be at present. And they maintain that this failure of the scientists to
discover the truth is entirely due to their materialism and contempt for
transcendental sciences. Yet although the scientific minds in our
century are as far from the true and correct doctrine of Evolution as
ever, there may be still some hope left for the future, as we find
another great scientist giving us a faint glimmer of it.

In an article in *Popular Science Review* (Vol. **XIV**., p. 252) on
"Recent Researches in Minute Life," we find Mr. H. J. Slack, F.C.S.,
Sec. R.M.S., saying: "There is an evident convergence of all sciences,
from physics to chemistry and physiology, toward *some* doctrine of
evolution and development, of which the facts of Darwinism *will form
part*, but what ultimate aspect this doctrine will take, there is
little, if any, evidence to show, and *perhaps it will not be shaped by
the human mind until metaphysical as well as physical inquiries are much
more advanced.*"

This is a happy forecast indeed. The day *may* come, then, when the
"Natural Selection," as taught by Mr. Darwin and Mr. Herbert Spencer,
will form only *a part*, in its ultimate modification, of our Eastern
doctrine of Evolution, which will be Manu and Kapila *esoterically
explained.*
