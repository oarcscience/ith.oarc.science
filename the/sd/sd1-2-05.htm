ON THE HIDDEN DEITY, ITS SYMBOLS AND GLYPHS.</H4>

<P>
<STRONG>T</STRONG>HE Logos or Creative deity, the &quot;Word made
Flesh,&quot; of every religion, has to be traced to its ultimate
source and Essence. In India, it is a Proteus of 1,008 divine
names and aspects in each of its <EM>personal </EM>transformations,
from Brahma-Purusha down through the Seven <EM>divine </EM>Rishis
and ten <EM>semi</EM>-divine Prajapati (also Rishis) to the <EM>divine-human
</EM>Avatars. The same puzzling problem of the &quot;One in many&quot;
and the multitude in One, is found in other Pantheons, in the
Egyptian, the Greek and the Chaldeo-Judaic, the latter having
made confusion still more confused by presenting its Gods as euhemerizations,
in the shapes of Patriarchs. The latter are now accepted by those
who reject Romulus as a myth, and are represented as living and
<EM>historical </EM>Entities<EM>. Verbum satis sapienti.</EM>

<P>
In the Zohar, En-Soph is also the <STRONG>O</STRONG>NE, and the
infinite Unity. This was known to the very few learned Fathers
of the Church, who were aware that Jehovah was but a <EM>third
rate </EM>potency and no &quot;highest&quot; God. But while complaining
bitterly of the Gnostics and saying . . . &quot;our Heretics hold
. . . that <STRONG>P</STRONG>ROPATOR is known but to the <EM>Only
begotten </EM>Son* (who is Brahma among the rest) that is to the
mind&quot; (<EM>nous</EM>),<EM> </EM>Irenaeus never mentioned
that the Jews did the same in their real <EM>secret </EM>books.
Valentinus, &quot;the profoundest doctor of the Gnosis,&quot;
held that &quot;there was a perfect AION who existed before Bythos,
or Buthon (the first father of unfathomable nature, which is the
second Logos) called Propator.&quot; It is thus <STRONG>A</STRONG>ION,
who springs as a Ray from Ain-Soph (who <EM>does not create</EM>),<EM>
</EM>and <STRONG>A</STRONG>ION, who creates, or <EM>through </EM>whom,
rather, everything is created, or evolves.

<P>
* As Mulaprakriti is known only to Iswar, the <B>L</B>OGOS, as
he is called now by Mr. T. Subba Row, of Madras. (See his <EM>Bhagavadgita
</EM>Lectures.)<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 350 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</H6>

<P>
For, as the Basilidians taught, &quot;there was a supreme god,
<EM>Abraxas</EM>,<EM> </EM>by<EM> </EM>whom was created mind&quot;
(<EM>Mahat</EM>,<EM> </EM>in Sanskrit, <EM>Nous </EM>in Greek).
&quot;From Mind proceeded the word, <EM>Logos</EM>,<EM> </EM>from
the word, Providence (Divine Light, rather), then from it Virtue
and Wisdom in Principalities, Powers, Angels, etc., etc.&quot;
By these (Angels) the 365 AEons were created. &quot;Amongst the
lowest, indeed, and those who made this world, he (Basilides)
sets last of all the God of the Jews, whom he denies to be God
(and very rightly), affirming he is one of the angels&quot; (<EM>Ibid.</EM>)<EM>.
</EM>Here, then, we find the same system as in the Puranas, wherein
the Incomprehensible drops a seed, which becomes the golden egg,
from which Brahma is produced. Brahma produces Mahat, etc., etc.
True Esoteric philosophy, however, speaks neither of &quot;creation&quot;
nor of &quot;evolution&quot; in the sense the exoteric religions
do. All these personified Powers are not evolutions from one another,
but so many aspects of the one and sole manifestation of the <STRONG>A</STRONG>BSOLUTE
all. The same system as the gnostic prevails in the Sephirothal
aspects of Ain-Soph, yet, as <EM>these aspects are in Space and
Time</EM>,<EM> </EM>a certain order is maintained in their successive
appearances. Therefore, it becomes impossible not to take notice
of the great changes that the <EM>Zohar </EM>has undergone under
the handling of generations of Christian Mystics. For, even in
the metaphysics of the Talmud, the &quot;lower Face&quot; (or
&quot;Lesser Countenance&quot;), the microprosopus, in fact, could
never be placed on the plane of the same abstract ideal as the
Higher, or &quot;Greater Countenance,&quot; macroprosopus. The
latter is, in the Chaldean Kabala, a pure abstraction; the Word
or <STRONG>L</STRONG>OGOS, or <STRONG>D</STRONG>ABAR (in Hebrew),
which Word, though it becomes in fact a plural number, or &quot;Words&quot;
-- <STRONG>D</STRONG>(a)<STRONG>B</STRONG>(a)<STRONG>R</STRONG>IM,
when it reflects itself, or falls into the aspect of a Host (of
angels, or Sephiroth, &quot;numbers&quot;) is still collectively
<STRONG>O</STRONG>NE, and on the ideal plane a nought -- 0, a
&quot;No-thing.&quot; <STRONG>I</STRONG>T is without form or being,
&quot;with no likeness with anything else.&quot; (<EM>Franck</EM>,<EM>
</EM>&quot;<EM>Die Kabbala</EM>,&quot;<EM> p. </EM>126.) And even
Philo calls the Creator, the<EM> Logos </EM>who stands next God,
&quot;<EM>the </EM><STRONG>S</STRONG>ECOND <STRONG>G</STRONG>OD,&quot;
and &quot;the second God who is his (Highest God's) <STRONG>W</STRONG>ISDOM&quot;
(<EM>Philo. Quaest. et Solut</EM>)<EM>. </EM>Deity is not God.
It is NOTHING, and DARKNESS. It is nameless, and therefore called
<EM>Ain-Soph</EM> --<EM> </EM>&quot;the<EM> </EM>word<EM> Ayin</EM>
meaning nothing.&quot; <EM>See Franck </EM>&quot;<EM>Die Kabbala</EM>,&quot;<EM>
p. </EM>153. <EM> See also Section XII.</EM>,<EM> </EM>&quot;<EM>Theogony
of the Creative Gods.</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>The &quot;Highest God&quot;
(the unmanifested <STRONG>L</STRONG>OGOS) is its Son.
<P>
Nor are most of the gnostic systems, which come down to us mutilated
by the Church Fathers, anything better than the distorted shells
of the original speculations. Nor were they <EM>open </EM>to the
public or reader, at any time; <EM>i.e.</EM>, had their hidden
meaning or esotericism been revealed, it would have been no more
an esoteric teaching, and this could never be. Alone Marcus (the
chief of the Marcosians, 2nd century), who taught<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 351 THE GNOSTIC IDEA.</H6>

<P>
that deity had to be viewed under the symbol of <EM>four syllables</EM>,<EM>
</EM>gave out more of the esoteric truths than any other Gnostic.
But even he was never well understood. For it is only on the surface
or dead letter of his<EM> Revelation </EM>that it appears that
God is a quaternary, to wit: &quot;the Ineffable, the Silence,
the Father, and Truth,&quot; -- in reality it is quite erroneous,
and divulges only one more esoteric riddle. This teaching of Marcus
was that of the early Kabalists and ours. For he makes of Deity,
the number 30 <EM>in </EM>4 <EM>syllables</EM>,<EM> </EM>which,
translated esoterically, means a Triad or <EM>Triangle</EM>,<EM>
</EM>and a Quaternary or a square, in all <EM>seven</EM>,<EM>
</EM>which, on the lower plane made the seven divine or secret
letters of which the God-name is composed. This requires demonstration.
In his &quot;Revelation,&quot; speaking of divine mysteries expressed
by means of letters and numbers, Marcus narrates how the &quot;Supreme
Tetrad came down unto me (him) from the region which cannot be
seen nor named, <EM>in a female form</EM>,<EM> because the world
would have been unable to bear her appearing under a male figure</EM>,&quot;<EM>
</EM>and revealed to him &quot;the generation of the universe,
<EM>untold before to either </EM>gods or men.&quot;
<P>
This first sentence already contains a double meaning. Why should
a female figure be more easily borne or listened to by the world
than a male figure? On the very face of it this appears nonsensical.
Withal it is quite simple and clear to one who is acquainted with
the mystery-language. <EM>Esoteric Philosophy</EM>,<EM> </EM>or
the Secret Wisdom, was symbolized by a female form, while a male
figure stood for the <EM>Unveiled </EM>mystery. Hence, the world
not being ready to receive, could not bear it, and the Revelation
of Marcus had to be given allegorically. Then he writes:
<P>
&quot;When first the Inconceivable, the Beingless and Sexless
(the Kabalistic Ain-Soph) began to be in labour (<EM>i.e.</EM>,
when the hour of manifesting Itself had struck) and desired that
Its Ineffable should be born (the first <STRONG>L</STRONG>OGOS,
or AEon, or Aion), and its invisible should be clothed with form,
its mouth opened and uttered the word like unto itself. This word
(logos) manifested itself in the form of the Invisible One. The
uttering of the (ineffable) name (through the word) came to pass
in this manner. He (the Supreme Logos) uttered the first word
of his name, which is a <EM>syllable of four letters. </EM>Then
the second syllable was added, <EM>also of four letters. </EM>Then
the third, composed of <EM>ten </EM>letters; and after this the
fourth, which contains <EM>twelve</EM> letters. The whole name
consists thus of <EM>thirty letters </EM>and of <EM>four syllables.
</EM>Each letter has its own accent and way of writing, but neither
understands nor ever beholds that form of the whole Name, -- no;
not even the power of the letter that stands next to Itself (to
the Beingless and the Inconceivable.)* All these sounds when united
are the collective Beingless,
<H6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
</H6>

<P>
* Iswara, or the Logos, cannot see Parabrahmam, but only Mulaprakriti,
says the lecturer, in the Four Lectures on Bhagavatgita. (See<EM>
Theosophist</EM>,<EM> </EM>Feb., 1887.)<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 352 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</H6>

<P>
unbegotten AEon, and <EM>these </EM>are the Angels that are ever
beholding the face of the Father* (the Logos, the &quot;second
God,&quot; who stands next God, &quot;the Inconceivable,&quot;
according to Philo).
<P>
This is as plain as ancient esoteric secrecy would make it. It
is as Kabalistic, but less veiled than the Zohar in which the
mystic names or attributes are also four syllabled, twelve, forty-two,
and even seventy-two syllabled words! The <EM>Tetrad </EM>shows
to Marcus the TRUTH in the shape of a naked woman, and letters
every limb of that figure, calling her head [[omega]], her neck
[[psi]], shoulders and hands [[gamma]], and [[chi]], etc., etc.
In this Sephira is easily recognised, the Crown (<EM>Kether</EM>)<EM>
</EM>or head being numbered <EM>one</EM>; the brain or Chochmah,
2; the heart, or Intelligence (Binah), 3; and the other seven
Sephiroth representing the limbs of the body. The Sephirothal
Tree is the Universe, and Adam Kadmon represents it in the West
as Brahma represents it in India.
<P>
Throughout, the 10 Sephiroth are represented as divided into the
three higher, or the spiritual <EM>Triad</EM>,<EM> </EM>and the
lower Septenary. The true Esoteric meaning of the sacred number
seven is cleverly veiled in the <EM>Zohar; </EM>yet was betrayed
by the double way of writing &quot;in the beginning&quot; or <EM>Be-resheeth</EM>,<EM>
</EM>and Be-raishath, the latter the &quot;Higher, or <EM>Upper
</EM>Wisdom.&quot; As shown by Mr. Macgregor Mathers in his <EM>Kabbalah
</EM>(p. 47), and in the <EM>Qabbalah </EM>of Mr. T. Myer (p.
233), both of these Kabalists being supported by the best ancient
authorities, these words have a dual and secret meaning. <EM>Braisheeth
bara Elohim </EM>means that the <EM>six</EM>,<EM> </EM>over which
stands the <EM>seventh </EM>Sephiroth, belong to the lower material
class, or, as the author says: &quot;Seven . . . . are applied
to the Lower Creation, and three to the spiritual man, the Heavenly
Prototypic or first Adam.&quot;
<P>
When the Theosophists and Occultists say that God is no <STRONG>B</STRONG>EING,
for <STRONG>I</STRONG>T is nothing, <EM>No-Thing</EM>,<EM> </EM>they
are more reverential and religiously respectful to the Deity than
those who call God a <STRONG>H</STRONG>E, and thus make of Him
a gigantic <STRONG>M</STRONG>ALE.
<P>
He who studies the Kabala will soon find the same idea in the
ultimate thought of its authors, the earlier and great Hebrew
Initiates, who got this secret Wisdom at Babylonia from the Chaldean
Hierophants, while Moses got his in Egypt. The Zohar cannot well
be judged by its after translations in Latin and other tongues,
as all those ideas were, of course, softened and made to fit in
with the views and <EM>policy </EM>of its Christian arrangers;
but in truth its ideas are identical with those of all other religious
systems. The various Cosmogonies show that the Archaic Universal
Soul was held by every nation as the &quot;Mind&quot; of the Demiurgic
Creator; and that it

was called the &quot;Mother,&quot; <EM>Sophia </EM>with the Gnostics
(or the female Wisdom), the <EM>Sephira </EM>with the Jews, Saraswati
or Vach, with the Hindus, <EM>the Holy Ghost being a female Principle.</EM>

<P>
Hence, born from it, the <EM>Kurios </EM>or Logos was, with the
Greeks, the &quot;God, mind&quot; (<EM>nous</EM>)<EM>. </EM>&quot;Now
Koros (<EM>Kurios</EM>)<EM> </EM>signifies the pure and unmixed
nature of intellect -- wisdom,&quot; says Plato in &quot;Cratylus&quot;;
and Kurios is Mercury, the Divine Wisdom, and &quot;mercury is
the Sol&quot; (Sun) (&quot;<EM>Arnobius</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>vi.,
xii.), from whom Thot-Hermes received this divine Wisdom. While,
then, the <EM>Logoi </EM>of all countries and religions are correlative
(in their sexual aspects) with the female Soul of the World or
the &quot;Great Deep;&quot; the deity, from which these <EM>two
in one </EM>have their being, is ever concealed and called the
&quot;Hidden One,&quot; connected only indirectly with Creation,*
as it can act only through the Dual Force emanating from the Eternal
Essence. Even AEsculapius, called the &quot;Saviour of all,&quot;
is identical, according to ancient classics, with <EM>Phta</EM>,<EM>
</EM>the Egyptian Creative Intellect (or Divine Wisdom), and with
Apollo, Baal, Adonis and Hercules (<EM>see Dunlap</EM>'<EM>s </EM>&quot;<EM>Mystery
of Adonis</EM>,&quot;<EM> pp. </EM>23<EM> and </EM>95); and Phta
is, in one of its aspects, the &quot;Anima Mundi,&quot; the Universal
Soul of Plato, the &quot;Divine Spirit&quot; of the Egyptians,
the &quot;Holy Ghost&quot; of the early Christians and Gnostics,
and the <EM>Akasa </EM>of the Hindus, and even, in its lower aspect,
the <EM>Astral Light. </EM>For <EM>Phta </EM>was originally the
&quot;God of the Dead,&quot; he in whose bosom they were received,
hence the <EM>Limbus </EM>of<EM> </EM>the Greek Christians, or
the Astral Light. It is far later that <EM>Phta </EM>was classed
with the Sun-gods, his name signifying &quot;he who opens,&quot;
as he is shown to be the first to unveil the face of the dead
mummy, to call the soul to <EM>life in his bosom. </EM>(See<EM>
Maspero</EM>'<EM>s </EM>&quot;<EM>Bulaq Museum.</EM>&quot;)<EM>
</EM><B>K</B>NEPH, the Eternal <EM>Unrevealed</EM>,<EM> </EM>is
represented by the snake-emblem of eternity encircling a water-urn,
with its head hovering <EM>over the </EM>&quot;<EM>waters</EM>&quot;<EM>
which it incubates with its breath </EM>-- another form of one
and the same idea of &quot;Darkness,&quot; its ray moving on the
waters, &amp;c. As &quot;Logos-Soul,&quot; this <EM>permutation
</EM>is called Phta; as Logos-Creator, he becomes <EM>Imhot-pou</EM>,<EM>
</EM>his son, &quot;the god of the handsome face.&quot; In their
primitive characters these two were the first Cosmic Duad, <EM>Noot</EM>,<EM>
</EM>&quot;space or <EM>Sky</EM>,&quot;<EM> </EM>and<EM> Noo</EM>,<EM>
</EM>&quot;the primordial Waters,&quot; the Androgyne Unity, above
whom was the <EM>Concealed </EM><STRONG>B</STRONG>REATH of Kneph.
And all of them had the aquatic animals and plants sacred to them,
the <EM>ibis</EM>,<EM> </EM>the <EM>swan</EM>,<EM> </EM>the<EM>

long as the <EM>Absolute </EM>is within <EM>Oulom</EM>,<EM>* </EM>the
boundless and termless time, as such, En-Soph cannot be the Creator
or even the modeller of the Universe, nor can he be <EM>Aur </EM>(light).
Therefore En-Soph is also Darkness. The <EM>immutably </EM>Infinite
and the <EM>absolutely </EM>Boundless can neither will, think,
nor act. To do this it has to become finite, and it does so, by
its ray penetrating into the mundane egg -- infinite space --
and emanating from it as a finite god. All this is left to the
ray latent in the one. When the period arrives, the absolute will
expands naturally the force within it, according to the Law of
which it is the inner and ultimate Essence. The Hebrews did not
adopt the egg as a symbol, but they substituted for it the &quot;Duplex
heavens,&quot; for, translated correctly, the sentence &quot;God
made the heavens and the earth&quot; would read: -- &quot;In and
out of his own essence as a womb (the mundane egg), God created
the two heavens.&quot; But the Christians have chosen as the symbol
of their Holy Ghost, the dove.
<P>
&quot;Whosoever acquaints himself with <IMG SRC="sd1-354.gif" ALIGN="MIDDLE">
the Mercaba and the <EM>lahgash </EM>(secret speech or incantation),
will learn the secret of secrets.&quot; <EM>Lahgash </EM>is nearly
identical in meaning with Vach, the hidden power of the Mantras.
<P>
When the active period has arrived, from within the eternal essence
of Ain-Soph, comes forth Sephira, the active Power, called the
Primordial Point, and the Crown, <EM>Kether. </EM>It is only through
her that the &quot;Un-bounded Wisdom&quot; could give a concrete
form to the abstract Thought. Two sides of the upper triangle
by which the ineffable Essence and the universe -- its manifested
body -- are symbolized, the right side and the base are composed
of unbroken lines; the third, the left side, is dotted. It is
through the latter that emerges Sephira. Spreading in every direction,
she finally encompasses the whole triangle. In this emanation
the triple triad is formed. From the invisible Dew falling from
the higher <EM>Uni-triad </EM>(thus leaving 7 sephiroths only),
the &quot;Head&quot; Sephira <EM>creates </EM>primeval waters,
<EM>i.e.</EM>, Chaos takes shape. It is the first stage towards
the solidification of spirit which through various modifications
will produce earth. &quot;<EM>It requires earth and water to make
a living soul</EM>,&quot;<EM> </EM>says Moses. It requires the
image of an aquatic bird to connect it with water, the female
element of procreation with the egg and the bird that fecundates
it.
<P>
When Sephira emerges like an active power from within the latent
Deity, she is female; when she assumes the office of a creator,
she becomes a male; hence, she is androgyne. She is the &quot;Father
and

* With the ancient Jews, as shown by Le Clerc, the word <EM>Oulom</EM>
meant only a time whose beginning or end is not known. The term
&quot;eternity,&quot; properly speaking, did not exist in the
Hebrew tongue with the meaning, for instance, applied by the Vedantins
to Parabrahm.<HR>

Mother Aditi,&quot; of the Hindu Cosmogony and of <EM>the Secret
Doctrine. </EM>If the oldest Hebrew scrolls had been preserved,
the modern Jehovah-worshipper would have found that many and uncomely
were the symbols of the <EM>creative </EM>god. The frog in the
moon, typical of his generative character, was the most frequent.
All the birds and animals now held &quot;unclean&quot; in the
Bible had been the symbols of the Deity in days of old. It was
because they were too sacred that a mask of uncleanness was placed
over them, in order to preserve them from destruction. The brazen
serpent was not a bit more poetical than the goose or swan, if
symbols are to be accepted <EM>a la lettre.</EM> 
<P>
In the words of the <EM>Zohar: </EM>&quot;The Indivisible Point,
which has no limit and cannot be comprehended because of its purity
and brightness, expanded <EM>from without</EM>,<EM> </EM>forming
a brightness that served the indivisible Point as a veil;&quot;
yet the latter also &quot;<EM>could not be viewed in </EM>consequence
of its immeasurable light. It too <EM>expanded from without</EM>,<EM>
</EM>and this expansion was its garment. Thus through a constant
<EM>upheaving </EM>(motion) finally the world originated&quot;
(<EM>Zohar I. </EM>20<EM>a</EM>)<EM>. </EM>The Spiritual substance
sent forth by the Infinite Light is the <EM>first </EM>Sephira
or <EM>Shekinah: </EM>Sephira<EM> exoterically </EM>contains all
the other nine Sephiroths in her<EM>. Esoterically </EM>she contains
but two,* <EM>Chochmah </EM>or<EM> Wisdom</EM>,<EM> </EM>&quot;a<EM>
</EM>masculine, <EM>active</EM> potency whose divine name is <EM>Jah</EM>
(<IMG SRC="sd1-355a.gif" ALIGN="MIDDLE">),&quot; and <STRONG>B</STRONG>INAH,
a feminine passive potency, Intelligence, represented by the divine
name Jehovah (<IMG SRC="sd1-355b.gif" ALIGN="MIDDLE">); which
two potencies form, with Sephira the third, the Jewish trinity
or the Crown, <STRONG>K</STRONG>ETHER. These two Sephiroths called
Father, <EM>Abba</EM>,<EM> </EM>and Mother <EM>Amona</EM>,<EM>
</EM>are the duad or the double-sexed <EM>logos </EM>from which
issued the other seven Sephiroths. (See <EM>Zohar.</EM>)<EM> </EM>This<EM>
</EM>first Jewish triad (Sephira, Chochmah, and Binah) is the
Hindu <EM>Trimurti.* </EM>However veiled, even in the <EM>Zohar</EM>,<EM>
</EM>and more still in the exoteric Pantheon of India, every particular
connected with one is reproduced in the other. The <EM>Prajapati
</EM>are the Sephiroths. Ten with Brahma they dwindle to seven,
when the Trimurti, and the Kabalistic triad, are separated from
the rest. The seven Builders (Creators) become the seven <EM>Prajapati</EM>,<EM>
</EM>or the seven Rishis, in the same order as the Sephiroths
become the Creators; then the Patriarchs, etc. In both Secret
Systems, the One Universal Essence is incomprehensible and <EM>inactive
</EM>in its absoluteness, and can be connected with the building
of the Universe only in an indirect way. In both, the primeval
Malefemale or androgynous Principle, and their ten and seven Emanations
(Brahma-Viraj and Aditi-Vach on the one part and the Elohim-Jehovah,
or Adam-Adami (Adam Kadmon) and Sephira Eve on the

Creator, whose seven &quot;mind born&quot; sons are the primeval

other), with their Prajapati and Sephiroths, represent in their
totality, first of all the Archetypal man, the <EM>Proto-logos;
</EM>and only in their secondary aspect do they become Cosmic
powers, and astronomical or sidereal bodies. If Aditi is the mother
of the gods, <EM>Deva-Matri</EM>,<EM> </EM>Eve<EM> </EM>is the
mother of all living; they are the <EM>Sakti </EM>or generative
power in their female aspect of the &quot;Heavenly man,&quot;
and they are all compound Creators. Says a &quot;<EM>Gupta Vidya</EM>&quot;<EM>
</EM>Sutra: &quot;In the beginning, a ray issuing from Paramarthika
(<EM>the one </EM>and only true existence), it became manifested
in Vyavaharika (conventional existence) which was used as a <EM>Vahan
</EM>to descend into the Universal Mother, and to cause her to
expand (swell, <EM>brih</EM>)<EM>.</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>And in
the <EM>Zohar </EM>it is stated: &quot;The Infinite Unity, formless
and without similitude, after the form of the heavenly man was
created, used it. The Unknown Light* (Darkness) used the <IMG SRC="sd1-356a.gif" ALIGN="MIDDLE">(heavenly
form) as a chariot <IMG SRC="sd1-356b.gif" ALIGN="MIDDLE">through
which to descend, and wished to be called by this form, which
is the sacred name Jehovah.&quot;
<P>
As the Zohar says: &quot;In the beginning was the Will of the
King, prior to any other existence. . . . It (the Will) sketched
the forms of all things that had been concealed but now came into
view. And there went forth as a sealed secret from the head of
Ain Soph, a nebulous spark of matter, without shape or form. .
. . Life is drawn from below, and from above the source renews
itself, the sea is always full and spreads its waters everywhere.&quot;
Thus the deity is compared to a shoreless sea, to water which
is &quot;the fountain of life&quot; (Zohar iii., 290). &quot;The
seventh palace, the fountain of life, is the first in the order
from above&quot; (ii. 261). Hence the Kabalistic tenet on the
lips of the very Kabalistic Solomon, who says in Proverbs ix.,
1: &quot;Wisdom hath builded her house; it hath hewn out its <EM>seven
</EM>pillars.&quot;

Whence then, all this identity of ideas, if there was no primeval
<STRONG>U</STRONG>NIVERSAL Revelation? The few points shown are
like a few straws in a hayrick, in comparison to that which will
be shown as the work proceeds. If we turn to that most hazy of
all Cosmogonies -- the Chinese, even there the same idea is found.
<EM>Tsi-tsai </EM>(the Self-Existent) is the unknown Darkness,
the root of the <EM>Wuliang-sheu </EM>(Boundless<EM> </EM>Age),
Amitabhe, and Tien (heaven) come later on. The &quot;great Extreme&quot;
of Confucius gives the same idea, his &quot;straws&quot; notwithstanding.
The latter are a source of great amusement to the missionaries.

brother Christians of other denominations, and yet one and all
accept <EM>a la lettre </EM>their own <EM>Genesis. </EM>If we
turn to Chaldea we find in it <EM>Anu</EM>,<EM> </EM>the concealed
deity, the One, whose name, moreover, shows it to be of Sanskrit
origin. <EM>Anu</EM>, which means in Sanskrit &quot;atom,&quot;
aniyamsam aniyasam (smallest of the small), is a name of Parabrahm
in the Vedantic philosophy; Parabrahm being described as smaller
than the smallest atom, and greater than the greatest sphere or
universe: &quot;<EM>Anagraniyam and Mahatorvavat.</EM>&quot;<EM>
</EM>This is what George Smith gives as the first verses of the
Akkadian <EM>Genesis </EM>as found in the Cuneiform Texts on the
&quot;<EM>Lateras Coctiles.</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>There also, we
find <EM>Anu </EM>the passive deity or En-Soph, <EM>Bel</EM>,
the Creator, the Spirit of God (Sephira) moving on the face of
the waters, hence water itself, and <EM>Hea</EM>,<EM> </EM>the
Universal Soul or wisdom of the three combined.

The first eight verses read thus:

1. When above, were not raised the heavens;<BR>
2<EM>.</EM> And below on the earth a plant had not grown up.<BR>
3. The abyss had not broken its boundaries.<BR>
4. The chaos (or water) Tiamat (the sea) was the producing mother
of the whole of them. (This is the Cosmical Aditi and Sephira.)
<BR>
5. Those waters at the beginning were ordained but --<BR>
6. A tree had not grown, a flower had not unfolded.<BR>
7. When the gods had not sprung up, any one of them.<BR>
8. A plant had not grown, and order did not exist.

This was the chaotic or ante-genetic period -- the double Swan
and the Dark Swan, which becomes white, when Light is created.*
<P>
The symbol chosen for the majestic ideal of the Universal Principle
will seem little calculated to answer its sacred character. A
goose, or even a swan, may appear unfit, no doubt, to represent
the grandeur of the Spirit. Nevertheless, it must have had some
deep occult meaning, since it figures not only in every cosmogony
and world religion, but even was chosen by the mediaeval Christians,
the Crusaders, as the<EM> vehicle </EM>of the Holy Ghost supposed
to lead the army to Palestine, to wrench the Tomb of the Saviour
from the hands of the Saracen. If we are to credit Professor Draper's
statement in his &quot;Intellectual Development of Europe,&quot;
the Crusaders, led on by Peter the Hermit, were preceded, at the
head of the army, by the Holy Ghost under the shape of a white
gander in company of a goat. The Egyptian God of Time, Seb, carries
a goose on his head. Jupiter assumes the form of a swan and Brahma
also, because the root of all this is that mystery of mysteries
-- the <STRONG>M</STRONG>UNDANE <STRONG>E</STRONG>GG. (See preceding
&#167;).

* The Seven Swans that are believed to land from Heaven into Lake
Mansarovara, are in the popular fancy the Seven Rishis of the
Great Bear, who assume that form to visit the locality where the
Vedas were written.<HR>

One has to learn the reason of a symbol before one depreciates
it. The dual element of Air and Water is that of the ibis, swan,
goose and pelican, of crocodiles and frogs, lotus flowers and
water lilies, &amp;c.; and the result is the choice of the most
unseemly symbols among the modern as much as the ancient mystics.
Pan, the great god of nature, was generally figured in connection
with aquatic birds, geese especially, and so were other gods.
If, later on, with the gradual degeneration of religion, the gods
to whom geese were sacred, became Priapic deities, it does not
stand to reason that water fowls were made sacred to Pan and other
Phallic deities as some scoffers even of antiquity would have
it (<EM>see Petronii Satyrica</EM>,<EM> </EM>cxxxvi.); but that
the abstract and divine power of procreative nature had become
grossly anthropomorphized. Nor does the Swan of Leda show &quot;Priapic
doings and her enjoyment thereof,&quot; as Mr. Hargrave Jennings
chastely expresses it -- for the myth is but another version of
the same philosophical idea of cosmogony. Swans are frequently
found associated with Apollo, as they are the emblems of water
and fire (sun-light also), before the separation of the Elements.
<P>
Our modern symbologists might profit by some remarks made by a
well-known writer, Mrs. Lydia Maria Child. &quot;From time immemorial
an emblem has been worshipped in Hindostan as the type of creation,
or the origin of life. . . . Siva or the Mahadeva being not only
the reproducer of human forms, but also the fructifying principle,
the generative power that pervades the Universe. The maternal
emblem is likewise a religious type. This reverence for the production
of life, introduced into the worship of Osiris the sexual emblems.
Is it strange that they regarded with reverence the great mystery
of human birth? Were they impure thus to regard it? Or are <EM>we</EM>
impure that do not so regard it? But <EM>no clean and thoughtful
mind </EM>could so regard them. . . . We have travelled far, and
unclean have been the paths, since those old Anchorites first
spoke of God and the soul in the solemn depths of their first
sanctuaries. Let us not smile at their mode of tracing the infinite
and the incomprehensible Cause throughout all the mysteries of
nature, lest by so doing we cast the shadow of our own grossness
on their patriarchal simplicity.&quot; (&quot;<EM>Progress of
