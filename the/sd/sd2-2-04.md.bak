**T**HE **E**VIL **S**PIRIT: **W**HO, AND **W**HAT?

**O**UR present quarrel is exclusively with theology. The Church
enforces belief in a personal god and a personal devil, while Occultism
shows the fallacy of such a belief. And though for the Pantheists and
Occultists, as much as for the Pessimists, Nature is no better than "a
comely mother, but stone cold" -- this is true only so far as regards
*external* physical nature. They both agree that, to the superficial
observer, she is no better than an immense slaughter-house wherein
butchers become victims, and victims executioners in their turn. It is
quite natural that the pessimistically inclined profane, once convinced
of Nature's numerous shortcomings and failures, and especially of her
autophagous propensities, should imagine this to be the best evidence
that there is no deity *in abscondito* within Nature, nor anything
divine in her. Nor is it less natural that the materialist and the
physicist should imagine that everything is due to blind force and
chance, and to the survival of the *strongest,* even more often than of
the *fittest.* But the Occultists, who regard physical nature as a
bundle of most varied illusions on the plane of deceptive perceptions;
who recognise in every pain and suffering but the necessary pangs of
incessant procreation: a series of stages toward an ever-growing
perfectibility, which is visible in the silent influence of never-erring
Karma, or *abstract* nature -- the Occultists, we say, view the great
Mother otherwise. Woe to those who live without suffering. Stagnation
and death is the future of all that vegetates without a change. And how
can there be any change for the better without proportionate suffering
during the preceding stage? Is it not those only who have learnt the
deceptive value of earthly hopes and the illusive allurements of
external nature who are destined to solve the great problems of life,
pain, and death?

If our modern philosophers -- preceded by the medieval scholars -- have
helped themselves to more than one fundamental idea of antiquity,
theologians have built their God and his Archangels, their Satan and his
Angels, along with the Logos and his staff, entirely out of the
*dramatis personae* of the old heathen Pantheons. They would have been

welcome to these, had they not cunningly distorted the original
characters, perverted the philosophical meaning, and taking advantage of
the ignorance of Christendom -- the result of long ages of mental sleep,
during which humanity was permitted to think only by proxy -- tossed
every symbol into the most inextricable confusion. One of their most
sinful achievements in this direction, was the transformation of the
divine *alter ego* into the grotesque Satan of their theology.

As the whole philosophy of the problem of evil hangs upon the correct
comprehension of the constitution of the *inner* being of nature and
man, of the divine within the animal, and hence also the correctness of
the whole system as given in these pages, with regard to the crown piece
of evolution -- **M**AN -- we cannot take sufficient precautions against
theological subterfuges. When the good St. Augustine and the fiery
Tertullian called the Devil "the monkey of God," this could be
attributed to the ignorance of the age they lived in. It is more
difficult to excuse our modern writers on the same ground. The
translation of Mazdean literature has afforded to the Roman Catholic
writers the pretext for proving their point in the same direction once
more. They have taken advantage of the dual nature of Ahura Mazda in the
Zend Avesta and the Vendidad, and of his Amshaspends, to emphasize still
further their wild theories. *Satan is the plagiarist and the copyist*
*by anticipation* of the religion which came ages later. This was one of
the master strokes of the Latin Church, its best trump-card after the
appearance of Spiritualism in Europe. Though only a *succes d'estime,*
in general, even among those who are not interested in either Theosophy
or Spiritualism, yet the weapon is often used by the Christian (Roman
Catholic) Kabalists against the Eastern Occultists.

Now even the Materialists are quite harmless, and may be regarded as the
friends of Theosophy, when compared to some fanatical "Christian" (as
they call themselves, "Sectarian" as we call them) Kabalists, on the
Continent. These read the *Zohar,* not to find in it ancient Wisdom, but
to discover in its verses, by mangling the texts and meaning, Christian
dogmas, where none could ever have been meant; and, having fished them
out with the collective help of jesuitical casuistry and learning, the
supposed "Kabalists" proceed to write books and to mislead less
far-sighted students of the Kabala.\*

###### \[\[Footnote(s)\]\] -------------------------------------------------

\* Such a *pseudo*-Kabalist was the Marquis de Mirville in France, who,
having studied the *Zohar* and other old remnants of Jewish Wisdom under
the "Chevalier" Drach, an ancient Rabbi Kabalist converted to the Romish
Church -- wrote with his help half a dozen volumes full of slander and
calumnies against every prominent Spiritualist and Kabalist. From 1848
up to 1860 he persecuted unrelentingly the old Count d'Ourches, one of
the earliest Eastern Occultists in France, a man the scope of whose
occult knowledge will never be appreciated correctly by his survivors,
because he screened his real beliefs and knowledge under the mask of
Spiritism.

\[\[Vol. 2, Page\]\] 477 THE GENESIS OF THE DEVIL.

May we not then be permitted to drag the deep rivers of the Past, and
thus bring to the surface the root idea that led to the transformation
of the Wisdom-God, who had first been regarded as the creator of
everything that exists, into an Angel of Evil -- a ridiculous horned
biped, half goat and half monkey, with hoofs and a tail? We need not go
out of the way to compare the pagan demons of either Egypt, India, or
Chaldea with the devil of Christianity, for no such comparison is
possible. But we may stop to glance at the biography of the Christian
Devil, a piratical reprint from the Chaldeo-Judaean mythology: --

The primitive origin of this personification rests upon the Akkadian
conception of the cosmic powers -- the Heavens and the Earth -- in
eternal feud and struggle with Chaos. Their Silik-Muludag, "the God
amongst all the Gods," the "merciful guardian of men on Earth," was the
Son of Hea (or Ea) the great God of Wisdom, called by the Babylonians
Nebu. With both peoples -- as in the case of the Hindu gods -- their
deities were both beneficent and maleficent. As Evil and punishment are
the agents of Karma, in an absolutely just retributive sense, so Evil
was the servant of the good (Hibbert Lect. 1887, pp. 101-115). The
reading of the Chaldeo-Assyrian tiles has now demonstrated it beyond a
shadow of doubt. We find the same idea in the Zohar. Satan was a Son,
and an Angel of God. With all the Semitic nations, the Spirit of the
Earth was as much the Creator in his own realm as the Spirit of the
Heavens. They were twin brothers and interchangeable in their functions,
when not two in one. Nothing of that which we find in Genesis is absent
from the Chaldeo-Assyrian religious beliefs, even in the little that has
hitherto been deciphered. The great "Face of the Deep" of Genesis is
traced in the *Tohu-bohu,* "Deep," "Primeval Space," or Chaos of the
Babylonians. Wisdom (the Great Unseen God) -- called in *Genesis* chap.
i. the "Spirit of God" -- lived, for the older Babylonians as for the
Akkadians, in the *Sea of Space.* Toward the days described by Berosus,
this sea became the visible waters *on the face of the Earth* -- the
crystalline abode of the great mother, the mother of Ea and all the
gods, which became, still later, the great Dragon Tiamat, the Sea
Serpent. Its last stage of development was the great struggle of Bel
with the Dragon -- the Devil!

Whence the Christian idea that God cursed the Devil? The God of the
Jews, whomsoever he was, forbids cursing Satan. Philo Judaeus and
Josephus both state that the Law (the Pentateuch and the Talmud)
undeviatingly forbid one to curse the adversary, as also the gods of the
gentiles. "Thou shalt not revile the gods," quoth the god of Moses
(Exodus xxii. 28), for it is God who "hath divided (them) unto all
nations" (Deut. iv. 19); and those who speak evil of

------------------------------------------------------------------------

\[\[Vol. 2, Page\]\] 478 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.

"Dignities" (gods) are called "*filthy* dreamers" by Jude (8). For even
Michael the Archangel durst not bring against him (the devil) a railing
accusation, but said: "The Lord rebuke thee" (*ibid* 9). Finally the
same is repeated in the Talmud.\* "Satan appeared one day to a man who
used to curse him daily, and said to him: 'Why dost thou this?' Consider
that *God himself* would not curse me, but merely said: 'The Lord rebuke
thee, Satan.' "\*\*

This bit of Talmudic information shows plainly two things: (*a*) that
St. Michael is called "God" in the Talmud, and somebody else "the Lord";
and (*b*) that Satan is *a God,* of whom even the "Lord" is in fear. All
we read in the Zohar and other Kabalistic works on Satan shows plainly
that this "personage" is simply the personification of the abstract
evil, which is the weapon of Karmic law and **K**ARMA. It is our human
nature and man himself, as it is said that "Satan is always near and
inextricably interwoven with man." It is only a question of that Power
being latent or active in us.

It is a well-known fact -- to learned Symbologists at all events -- that
in every great religion of antiquity, it is the Logos Demiurge (the
second logos), or the first emanation from the mind (Mahat), who is made
to strike, so to say, the key-note of that which may be called the
correlation of individuality and personality in the subsequent scheme of
evolution. The Logos it is, who is shown in the mystic symbolism of
cosmogony, theogony, and anthropogony, playing two parts in the drama of
Creation and Being, *i.e*., that of the purely human personality and the
divine impersonality of the so-called Avatars, or divine incarnations,
and of the universal Spirit, called Christos by the Gnostics, and the
Farvarshi (or *Ferouer)* of Ahura Mazda in the Mazdean philosophy. On
the lower rungs of theogony the celestial Beings of lower Hierarchies
had each a *Farvarshi,* or a celestial "Double." It is the same, only a
still more mystic, reassertion of the Kabalistic axiom, *"Deus est Demon
inversus";* the word "demon," however, as in the case of Socrates, and
in the spirit of the meaning given to it by the whole of antiquity,
standing for the guardian Spirit, an "Angel," not a devil of Satanic
descent, as theology will have it. The Roman Catholic Church shows its
usual logic and consistency by accepting, as the *ferouer* of Christ,
St. Michael, who was "his Angel Guardian," as *proved* by St.
Thomas,\*\*\* while he calls the prototypes of Michael and his synonyms,
such as Mercury, for example, devils

------------------------------------------------------------------------

###### \[\[Vol. 2, Page\]\] 479 GOD AND DEVIL, BOTH METATRONS.

The Church accepts positively the tenet that Christ has his *Ferouer* as
any other god or mortal has. Writes de Mirville: "Here we have the two
heroes of the Old Testament, the *Verbum* (?), or the *second* Jehovah,
and his *face* ('Presence,' as the Protestants translate) forming both
but one, and yet being two, a mystery which seemed to us unsolvable
before we had studied the doctrine of the Mazdean *ferouers,* and learnt
that the *ferouer* was the spiritual potency, at once *image,* *face,*
and the *guardian* of the Soul which finally assimilates the *ferouer."*
(*Memoires a l'Academie,* Vol. v., p. 516.) This is *almost* correct.

Among other absurdities, the Kabalists maintain that the word *metatron*
being divided into \[\[*meta*, *thronon*\]\], means *near the throne.*
It means quite the reverse, as meta means "beyond" and not "near." This
is of great importance in our argument. St. Michael, then, the *quis ut*
*Deus,* is the translator, so to speak, of the invisible world into the
visible and the objective.

They maintain, furthermore, along with the Roman Catholic Church, that
in the Biblical and Christian theology there does not exist a "higher
celestial personality, after the Trinity, than that of the Archangel or
the Seraphim, *Michael*." According to them, the conqueror of the Dragon
is "the archisatrap of the sacred militia, the guardian of the planets,
the King of the Stars, the slayer of Satan and the most powerful
Rector." In the mystic astronomy of these gentlemen, he is "the
conqueror of Ahriman, who having upset the sidereal throne of the
usurper, bathes in his stead in the solar fires"; and, defender of the
Christ-Sun, he approaches so near his Master, "that he seems to become
one with him . . . . Owing to this fusion with the **W**ORD (*Verbum*)
the Protestants, and among them Calvin, ended by losing sight entirely
of the duality, and saw no Michael but only his Master," writes the Abbe
Caron. The Roman Catholics, and especially their Kabalists, know better;
and it is they who explain to the world this duality, which affords to
them the means of glorifying the chosen ones of the Church, and of
rejecting and anathematizing all those Gods who may be in the way of
their dogmas.

Thus the same titles and the same names are given in turn to God and the
Archangel. Both are called *Metatron,* "both have the name of Jehovah
applied to them when they speak *one in the other" (sic)* as, according
to the *Zohar,* the term signifies equally "the Master and the
Ambassador." Both are the *Angel of the Face,* because, as we are
informed, if, on the one hand, the "Word" is called "the face (or the
Presence) and the image of the substance of God," on the other, "when

honour in the Latin Church.

speaking of the *Saviour* to the Israelites, Isaiah (?) tells them that
"the angel of his presence saved them in their affliction" -- "so he was
their Saviour."\* Elsewhere he (Michael) is called very plainly "the
Prince of the *Faces* of the Lord, the *glory* of the Lord." Both
(Jehovah and Michael) are "the *guides* of Israel\*\* . . . chiefs of
the *armies* of the Lord, *Supreme Judges* of the souls and even
Seraphs."\*\*\*

The whole of the above is given on the authority of various works by
Roman Catholics, and must, therefore, be orthodox. Some expressions are
translated to show what subtle theologians and casuists mean by the term
Ferouer,\*\*\*\* a word borrowed by some French writers from the *Zend
Avesta,* as said, and utilized in Roman Catholicism for a purpose
Zoroaster was very far from anticipating. In Fargard **XIX**. of the
*Vendidad* it is said (verse 14), "Invoke, O Zarathustra! my Farvarshi,
who am Ahura Mazda, the greatest, the best, the fairest of all beings,
the most solid, the most intelligent, . . . . and whose soul is the Holy
Word" (Mathra Spenta). The French Orientalists translate *Farvarshi* by
*"Ferouer."*

Now what is a Ferouer, or Farvarshi? In some Mazdean works (*e.g*.,
Ormazd Ahriman, ยงยง 112, 113), it is plainly implied that Farvarshi is
the *inner*, immortal man (or that *Ego* which reincarnates); that it
existed before its physical body and survives all such it happens to be
clothed in. "Not only man was endowed with the Farvarshi, *but gods*
*too,* and the sky, fire, waters, and plants." (Introduction to the
*Vendidad,* by J. Darmesteter). This shows as plainly as can be shown
that the *ferouer* is the "spiritual counterpart" of whether god,
animal, plant, or even element, *i.e*., the refined and the *purer* part
of the grosser creation, the soul of the body, whatever the body may
happen to be. Therefore does Ahura Mazda recommend Zarathustra to invoke
his *Farvarshi* and not himself (Ahura-Mazda); that is to say, the
impersonal and *true* Essence of Deity, *one with Zoroaster's own Atman*
(or Christos), not the *false* and personal appearance. This is quite
clear.

Now it is on this divine and ethereal prototype that the Roman Catholics
seized so as to build up the supposed difference between their god and
angels, and the deity and its aspects, or the gods of the old religions.
Thus, while calling Mercury, Venus, Jupiter (whether as gods or planets)
**D**EVILS, they yet make of the same Mercury the *ferouer* of their
Christ. This fact is undeniable. Vossius (*De Idol.,* **II**., 373)

proves that Michael is the Mercury of the *pagans,* and Maury and other
French writers corroborate him, and add that "according to great
theologians *Mercury and the Sun are one,"* (?) and no wonder, they
think, since "Mercury being so near the Wisdom of the *Verbum* (the
Sun), must be absorbed by and confounded with him."

This "pagan" view was accepted from the first century of our era, as
shown in the ORIGINAL *Acts of the Apostles* (the English translation
being worthless). So much is Michael the Mercury of the Greeks and other
nations, that when the inhabitants of Lystra mistook Paul and Barnabas
for Mercury and Jupiter -- "the gods have come down to us in the
likeness of men," -- verse 12 (xiv.) adds: "And they called Barnabas
Zeus, and Paul, Hermes (or Mercury), because he was the *leader of the*
WORD *(Verbum),*" and not "the chief speaker," as erroneously translated
in the authorised, and repeated even in the revised, English Bible.
Michael is the angel in the Vision, the Son of God, "who was like unto a
Son of Man." It is the Hermes-Christos of the Gnostics, the
Anubis-Syrius of the Egyptians, the Counsellor of Osiris in *Amenti,*
the Michael *leontoid* \[\[*ophiomorphos*\]\] of the Ophites, who wears
on certain Gnostic jewels a lion *head,* like his father Ildabaoth. (See
King's *Gnostics*.)

Now to all this the Roman Catholic Church consents tacitly, many of her
writers avowing it publicly. And, unable to deny the flagrant
"borrowing" of their Church, who "spoilt" the symbols of her seniors, as
the Jews had "spoilt" the Egyptians of their jewels of silver and gold,
they explain the fact quite coolly and as seriously. Thus the writers
who were hitherto *timid* enough to see, in this repetition by Christian
dogmas of old Pagan ideas, "a *legendary plagiarism* perpetrated by
man," are gravely assured that, far from such a simple solution of the
almost perfect resemblance, it has to be attributed to quite another
cause: "to a *prehistorical* plagiarism, of a *superhuman* origin."

If the reader would know how, he must kindly turn to the same fifth
volume of de Mirville's work. Please note that this author was the
*official and recognised defender* of the Roman Church, and was helped
by the learning of all the Jesuits. On page 518 we read: --

"We have pointed out several demi-gods, and also very historical heroes
of the pagans, who were predestined from the moment of their birth, *to
ape while dishonouring it,* the nativity of the hero, *who was quite*
*God,* before whom the whole earth had to bow; we traced them being born
as *he* was, from an immaculate mother; we saw them strangling serpents
in their cradles, fighting against demons, performing miracles, dying as
martyrs, descending to the nether world and rising again from the dead.
And we have bitterly deplored that timid and shy Christians should feel
compelled to explain all such identities on the ground of

coincidence of myth and symbol. They forgot apparently these words of
the Saviour: '**A**LL THAT CAME BEFORE ME ARE THIEVES AND ROBBERS,' a
word which explains all without any absurd negation and which I
commented in these words 'The Evangel is a sublime drama, *parodied*
*and played before its appointed time by ruffians.*' "

The "ruffians" (*les droles*)*,* are of course *demons* whose manager is
Satan. Now this is the easiest and the most sublime and simple way of
getting out of the difficulty! The Rev. Dr. Lundy, a Protestant de
Mirville, followed the happy suggestion in his "Monumental
Christianity," and so did Dr. Sepp of Munich in his works written to
prove the divinity of Jesus and the Satanic origin of all other
Saviours. So much greater the pity that a systematic and collective
plagiarism, which went on for several centuries on the most gigantic
scale, should be explained by another plagiarism, this time in the
fourth Gospel. For the sentence quoted from it, "All that ever came
before me, etc.," is a *verbatim* repetition of words written in the
"Book of Enoch" lxxxix. In the *Introduction* to Archbishop Lawrence's
translation of it from an Ethiopic **MS**. in the Bodleian Library, the
editor, author of the "Evolution of Christianity," remarks: --

"In revising the proof-sheets of the Book of Enoch . . . . . the parable
of the sheep, rescued by the good Shepherd from hireling guardians and
ferocious wolves, *is obviously borrowed by the fourth* *Evangelist*
from Enoch, lxxxix., in which the author depicts the shepherds as
killing . . . the sheep before the advent of their Lord, and thus
discloses the true meaning of that hitherto mysterious passage in the
Johannine parable -- 'All that ever came before me are thieves and
robbers' -- language in which we now detect an obvious reference to the
allegorical shepherds of Enoch."

It is too late in the day to claim that it is Enoch who borrowed from
the New Testament, instead of *vice versa.* Jude (14-15) quotes
*verbatim* from Enoch a long passage about the coming of the Lord with
his 10,000 saints, and naming specifically the prophet, *acknowledges*
the source. This "parallelism between prophet and apostle, have placed
beyond controversy that, *in the eyes of the author of an Epistle
accepted* *as divine revelation,* the Book of Enoch *was the inspired
production of an* *antediluvian patriarch .* . . " and further " . . .
the cumulative coincidence of language and ideas in Enoch and the
authors of **N.T**. Scripture, . . . clearly indicates that the work of
the Semitic Milton was the inexhaustible source from which Evangelists
and Apostles, or the men who wrote in their names, borrowed their
conceptions of the resurrection, judgment, immortality, perdition, and
of the universal reign of righteousness under the eternal dominion of
the Son of Man. This *Evangelical* *plagiarism* culminates in the
Revelation of John, which adapts the visions

of Enoch to Christianity, with modifications in which we miss the
sublime simplicity of the great Master of apocalyptic *prediction,* who
prophesied in the name of the antediluvian Patriarch." (**I**NT. xxxv.)

"Antediluvian," truly; but if the phraseology of the text dates hardly a
few centuries or even millenniums before the historical era, then it is
no more the original *prediction* of the events to come, but, in its
turn, a copy of some scripture of a prehistoric religion. . . . . "In
the Krita age, Vishnu, in the form of Kapila and other (inspired sages)
. . . imparts to the world true wisdom as Enoch did. In the Treta age he
restrains the wicked, in the form of a universal monarch (the
Chakravartin or the 'Everlasting King' of Enoch\*) and protects the
three worlds (or races). In the Dwapara age, in the person of
Veda-Vyasa, he divides the one Veda into four, and distributes it into
hundreds (*Sata*) of branches." Truly so; the *Veda* of the earliest
Aryans, before it was written, went forth into every nation of the
Atlanto-Lemurians, and sowed the first seeds of all the now existing old
religions. The off-shoots of the never dying tree of wisdom have
scattered their dead leaves even on Judaeo-Christianity. And at the end
of the Kali, our present age, Vishnu, or the "Everlasting King" will
appear as Kalki, and re-establish righteousness upon earth. The minds of
those who live at that time shall be awakened, and become as pellucid as
crystal. "The men who are thus changed by virtue of that peculiar time
(the sixth race) *shall be as the seeds* of other human beings, and
shall give birth to a race who shall follow the laws of the Krita age of
purity"; *i.e*., it shall be the seventh race, the race of "Buddhas,"
the "Sons of God," born of *immaculate* parents.

Thus it is pretty well established that Christ, the Logos, or the God in
Space and the Saviour on Earth, is but one of the echoes of the same
antediluvian and sorely misunderstood Wisdom. The history begins by the
descent on Earth of the "Gods" who incarnate in mankind, and this is the

the fall of a God into generation. Nowhere is the metaphysical truth
more clear, when explained esoterically, or more hidden from the average
comprehension of those who instead of appreciating the sublimity of the
idea can only degrade, than in the *Upanishads,* the esoteric glossaries
of the Vedas. The Rig-Veda, as Guignault characterized it, "is the most
sublime conception of the great highways of Humanity." The Vedas are,
and will remain for ever, in the esotericism of the Vedanta and the
Upanishads, "the mirror of the eternal Wisdom."

For over sixteen centuries the new masks, forced on the faces of the old
gods, have screened them from public curiosity, but they have finally
proved a misfit. Yet the metaphorical **F**ALL, and as metaphorical
atonement and crucifixion, led Western Humanity through roads knee-deep
in blood. Worse than all, they led it to believe in the dogma of the
evil spirit distinct from the spirit of all good, whereas the former
lives in all matter and pre-eminently in man. Finally it created the
God-slandering dogma of Hell and eternal perdition; it spread a thick
film between the higher intuitions of man and divine verities; and, most
pernicious result of all, it made people remain ignorant of the fact
that there were no fiends, no dark demons in the Universe before man's
own appearance on this, and probably on other earths. Henceforth the
people were led to accept, as the problematical consolation for this
world's sorrows, the thought of original sin.

The philosophy of that law in Nature, which implants in man as well as
in every beast a passionate, inherent, and instinctive desire for
freedom and self-guidance, pertains to psychology and cannot be touched
on now. To show the feeling in higher Intelligences, to analyse and give
a natural reason for it, would necessitate, moreover, an endless
philosophical explanation for which there is no room here. Perhaps, the
best synthesis of this feeling is found in three lines of Milton's
*Paradise Lost.* Says the "Fallen One": --

> "Here we may reign secure; and in my choice,  
> To reign is worth ambition, though in hell!  
> Better to reign in hell than serve in heaven . . . ."

Better be man, the crown of terrestrial production and king over its
*opus operatum,* than be lost among the will-less spiritual Hosts in
Heaven.

We have said elsewhere that the dogma of the first *Fall* rested on a
few verses in *Revelation;* these verses being now shown a plagiarism
from Enoch by some scholars. These grew into endless theories and
speculations, which gradually acquired the importance of dogma and
inspired tradition. Every one wanted to explain the verse about the
seven-headed dragon with his ten horns and seven crowns, whose tail

"drew the third part of the stars of heaven, and did cast them to the
earth," and whose place, with that of his angels, "was found no more in
heaven." What the seven heads of the Dragon (cycle) mean, and its *five*
wicked kings also, may be learned in the *Addenda* which close Part
**III**. of this Volume.

From Newton to Bossuet speculations were incessantly evolved in
Christian brains with regard to these obscure verses. . . . . "The star
that falls, is the heresiarch Theodosius" . . . . explains Bossuet. "The
clouds of smoke, are the heresies of the Montanists. . . . . The third
part of the stars, are the martyrs, and especially the doctors of
divinity. . . . ."

Bossuet ought to have known, however, that the events described in
*Revelation* were not original, and may, as shown, be found in other and
pagan traditions. There were no scholastics nor Montanists during Vedic
times, nor yet far later in China. But Christian *theology* had to be
*protected and saved.*

This was only natural. But why should truth be sacrificed in order to
protect from destruction the lucubrations of Christian theologians?

The *princeps aeris hujus,* the "prince of the air" of St. Paul, is not
the devil, but the effects of the astral light, as Eliphas Levi
correctly explains. The Devil is not "the God *of this period,"* as he
says, for it is the deity of every age and period, since man appeared on
earth, and matter, in its countless forms and states, had to fight for
its evanescent existence against other disintegrating Forces.

The "Dragon" is simply the symbol of the cycle and of the "Sons of
Manvantaric Eternity," who had descended on earth during a certain epoch
of its formative period. The "clouds of smoke" are a geological
phenomenon. The "third part of the stars of heaven" cast down to the
earth -- refers to the divine Monads, (the Spirits of the Stars in
Astrology) that circumambulate our globe; *i.e.*, the *human* Egos
destined to perform the whole cycle of incarnations. This sentence,
*qui* *circumambulat terram*, however, is again referred to the
**D**EVIL in theology, the mythical father of Evil being said to "fall
like lightning." Unfortunately for this interpretation, the "Son of
Man," or Christ, is expected, on the personal testimony of Jesus, to
descend on earth likewise, "As the lightning cometh out of the East,"\*
just in the same shape and under the same symbol as Satan, who is seen
"as lightning to fall from heaven."\*\* All these metaphors and figures
of speech, pre-eminently Oriental in their character, must have their
origin searched for in the East. In all the ancient cosmogonies *light*
comes from *darkness.* In Egypt, as elsewhere, *darkness* was "the

principle of all things." Hence Pymander, the "Thought *divine*," issues
as *light* from DARKNESS. *Behemoth\** is the principle of Darkness, or
*Satan,* in Roman Catholic Theology, and yet Job says of him that
"Behemoth is the chief (principle) of the ways of God" (xl. 19) --
*"Principium viarum Domini Behemoth!"*

Consistency does not seem to be a favourite virtue in any portion of
divine Revelation, so-called -- not as interpreted by theologians, at
any rate.

The Egyptians and the Chaldeans referred the birth of their *divine*
*Dynasties* to that period when creative Earth was in her last final
throes, in giving birth to her prehistoric mountain ranges, which have
since disappeared, her seas and her continents. Her face was covered
with "deep Darkness and in that (Secondary) Chaos was the principle of
all things" that developed on the globe later on. And our geologists
have ascertained that there was such a terrestrial conflagration in the
early geological periods, several hundred millions of years ago.\*\* As
to the tradition itself, every country and nation had it, each under its
respective national form.

It is not alone Egypt, Greece, Scandinavia or Mexico, that had their
Typhon, Python, Loki and its "falling" Demon, but China, also. The
Celestials have a whole literature upon the subject. In *King,* it is
said that in consequence of a rebellion against *Ti* of a proud Spirit
who said he was *Ti* himself, seven choirs of celestial spirits were
exiled upon earth, which *"brought a change in all nature,* heaven
itself *bending* down and uniting with earth."

And in the "Y-King," one reads: "The flying Dragon, superb and
rebellious, suffers now, and his pride is punished; he thought he would
reign in heaven, he reigns only on the earth."

Again, the *Tchoon-Tsieoo* says allegorically: "one night the stars
ceased shining in darkness, and deserted it, falling down like rain upon
the earth, *where they are now hidden."* These stars are the Monads.

Chinese cosmogonies have their "Lord of the Flame" and their "Celestial
Virgin," with little "Spirits to help and minister to her; and big
Spirits to fight those who are the enemies of other gods." But all this
does not prove that the said allegories are *presentments* or
*prophetic* writings which all refer to Christian theology.

The best proof one can offer to Christian Theologians that the

esoteric meaning in the Bible -- in both Testaments -- was the assertion
of the same idea as in our Archaic teachings -- to wit, that the "Fall
of the Angels" referred simply to the incarnation of angels "who had
broken through the Seven Circles" -- is found in the *Zohar.* Now the
Kabala of Simeon Ben Iochai is the soul and essence of its allegory, as
the later *Christian* Kabala is the "dark cloaked" Mosaic Pentateuch.
And it says (in the Agrippa **MSS**.):

"The wisdom of the Kabala rests in the science of the equilibrium and
Harmony."

"Forces that manifest without having been first equilibrized perish in
space" ("equilibrized" meaning differentiated).

"Thus perished the first Kings (the Divine Dynasties) of the ancient
world, the *self-produced* Princes of giants. They fell like rootless
trees, and were seen no more: for *they were the Shadow of the
Shadow*"*;* to wit, the *chhaya* of the Shadowy Pitris. (*Vide* about
the "Kings of Edom.")

"But those that came after them, who shooting down like falling stars
were enshrined in the shadows -- prevailed and to this day": Dhyanis,
who by incarnating in those "empty shadows," inaugurated the era of
mankind.

Every sentence in the ancient cosmogonies, unfolds to him who can read
between the lines the identity of the ideas, though under different
garbs.

The first lesson taught in Esoteric philosophy is, that the incognizable
Cause does not put forth evolution, whether consciously or
unconsciously, but only exhibits periodically *different aspects of
itself* to the perception of *finite* Minds. Now the collective Mind --
the Universal -- composed of various and numberless Hosts of Creative
Powers, however infinite in manifested Time, is still finite when
contrasted with the unborn and undecaying Space in its supreme essential
aspect. That which is finite cannot be perfect. Therefore there are
inferior Beings among those Hosts, but there never were any *devils* or
"disobedient Angels," for the simple reason that they are all governed
by Law. The *Asuras* who incarnated (call them by any other name),
followed in this a law as implacable as any other. They had manifested
prior to the Pitris, and as time (in Space) proceeds in Cycles, their
turn had come -- hence the numerous allegories *(Vide "Demon est Deus
inversus,"* Part **II**., Vol. I.). The name of *Asura* was first given
by the Brahmans indiscriminately to those who opposed their mummeries
and sacrifices, as the great *Asura* called "Asurendra" did. It is to
those ages, probably, that the origin of the idea of the demon, as
opposer and adversary, has to be traced.

The Hebrew Elohim, called in the translations "God," and who create
"light," are identical with the Aryan Asuras. They are also

referred to as the "Sons of Darkness" as a philosophical and logical
contrast to light immutable and eternal. The earliest Zoroastrians did
not believe in Evil or Darkness being *co-eternal* with Good or Light,
and they give the same interpretation. Ahriman is the manifested
*shadow* of **A**HURA-MAZDA *(Asura-mazda),* himself issued from
*Zeruana Akerne* "boundless (circle of) Time" or the Unknown Cause. "Its
glory," they say of the latter, "is too exalted, its light too
resplendent for either human intellect or mortal eye to grasp and see."
Its primal emanation *is eternal light, which, from having been
previously concealed in* **D**ARKNESS *was called to manifest itself and
thus was formed Ormazd, the* *"King of Life."* He is the "first-born" in
BOUNDLESS TIME, but, like his own antitype (pre-existing Spiritual
idea), *has lived within darkness from* *all eternity.* The six
Amshaspends (seven with himself, chief of all), the *primitive Spiritual
Angels and Men* are *collectively his Logos.* The Zoroastrian
Amshaspends create the world in six days or periods also, and rest on
the Seventh; whereas that *Seventh* is the *first* period or "day," in
esoteric philosophy, (*Primary* creation in the Aryan cosmogony). It is
that intermediate AEon which is the *Prologue* to creation, and which
stands on the borderland between the uncreated eternal Causation and the
produced finite effects; a state of *nascent* activity and energy as the
first aspect of the eternal immutable Quiescence. In *Genesis,* on which
no metaphysical energy has been spent, but only an extraordinary
acuteness and ingenuity to veil the esoteric Truth, "Creation" begins at
the third stage of manifestation. "God" or the *Elohim* are the "Seven
Regents" of Pymander. They are identical with all the other Creators.

But even in Genesis that *period* is hinted at by the abruptness of the
picture, and the *"darkness"* that was on the face of the deep. The
*Alahim* are shown to "create" -- that is to say, to build or to produce
the two or "double heaven" (*not* Heaven and Earth); which means, in so
many words, that they separated the upper manifested (angelic) heaven,
or plane of consciousness, from the lower or terrestrial plane; the (to
us) eternal and immutable *AEons* from those periods that are in space,
time and duration; Heaven from Earth, the unknown from the KNOWN -- to
the profane. Such is the meaning of the sentence in Pymander, which says
that: "**T**HOUGHT, the divine, which is **L**IGHT and **L**IFE (Zeruana
Akerne) produced through its **W**ORD, or first aspect," the *other,
operating* **T**HOUGHT, which being the god of Spirit and Fire,
constructed *seven Regents* enclosing within their circle the world of
Senses, named "fatal destiny." The latter refers to Karma; the "seven
circles" are the seven planets and planes, as also the seven invisible
Spirits, in the angelic spheres, whose visible symbols are the seven
planets,\* the

###### \[\[Footnote(s)\]\] -------------------------------------------------

\* Another proof, if any were needed, that the ancient Initiates knew of
more than seven planets is to be found in the Vishnu Purana, Book
**II**., ch. xii., where, describing \[\[continued on following page\]\]

seven *Rishis* of the great Bear and other glyphs. As said of the
Adityas by Roth: "they are neither sun, nor moon, nor stars, nor dawn,
but the eternal sustainers of this luminous life which exists as it were
behind all these phenomena."

It is they -- the "Seven Hosts" -- who, having "considered in their
Father (*divine* Thought) the plan of the operator," as says Pyrnander,
*desired* to operate (or build the world with its creatures) likewise;
for, having been born *"within* the sphere of operation" -- the
manifesting Universe -- such is the Manvantaric **L**AW. And now comes
the second portion of the passage, or rather of two passages merged into
one to conceal the full meaning. Those who were born within the sphere
of operation were "the brothers who loved him well." The latter -- the
"him" -- were the primordial angels: the Asuras, the Ahriman, the Elohim
-- or "Sons of God," of whom *Satan* was one -- all those spiritual
beings who were called the "Angels of Darkness," because that darkness
is *absolute* light, a fact now neglected if not entirely forgotten in
theology. Nevertheless, the spirituality of those much abused "Sons of
Light" which is Darkness, must be evidently as great in comparison with
that of the Angels next in order, as the ethereality of the latter would
be, when contrasted with the density of the human body. The former are
the "First-born"; therefore so near to the confines of pure quiescent
Spirit as to be merely the "PRIVATIONS" -- in the Aristotelian sense --
the *ferouers* or the ideal types of those who followed. They could not
create material, *corporeal* *things;* and, therefore, were said in
process of time to *have refused to* create, as *commanded by* "*God*"
-- otherwise, TO HAVE REBELLED.

Perchance, this is justified on that principle of the *Scientific*
theory which teaches us about light and sound and the effect of two
waves of equal length meeting. "If the two sounds be of the same
intensity, their coincidence produces a sound four times the intensity
of either, while their interference produces *absolute silence."*

Explaining some of the "heresies" of his day, Justin Martyr shows the
identity of all the world religions at their starting points. The first
*beginning* opens invariably with the *unknown* and PASSIVE deity, from
which emanates a certain active power or virtue, the Mystery that is
sometimes called **W**ISDOM, sometimes the **S**ON, very often God,
Angel, Lord, and **L**OGOS.\* The latter is sometimes applied to the
very first emanation, but in several systems it proceeds from the first
androgyne or double ray produced at the beginning by the unseen. Philo
depicts this wisdom as male and female. But though its first
manifestation

had a beginning, for it proceeded from *Oulom\** (Aion, time), the
highest of the AEons when emitted from the Father, it had remained with
him *before all creations,* for it is part of him.\*\* Therefore, Philo
Judaeus calls Adam Kadmon *"mind"* (the Ennoia of *Bythos* in the
Gnostic system). "The mind, let it be named Adam.\*\*\*

As the old Magian books explain it, the whole *event* becomes clear. A
thing can only exist through its opposite -- Hegel teaches us, and only
a little philosophy and spirituality are needed to comprehend the origin
of the later dogma, which is so truly satanic and infernal in its cold
and cruel wickedness. The Magians accounted for the origin of evil in
their exoteric teachings in this way. "Light can produce nothing but
light, and can never be the origin of evil"; how then was the evil
produced, since there was nothing co-equal or like the Light in its
production? Light, say they, produced several Beings, all of them
spiritual, luminous, and powerful. But a **G**REAT ONE (the "Great
Asura," Ahriman, Lucifer, etc., etc.) had an *evil thought,* contrary to
the Light. He doubted, and by that doubt he became dark.

This is a little nearer to the truth, but still wide of the mark. There
was no "EVIL thought" that originated the opposing Power, but simply
THOUGHT *per se;* something which, being cogitative, and containing
design and purpose, is therefore finite, and must thus find itself
naturally in opposition to pure quiescence, the as natural state of
absolute Spirituality and Perfection. It was simply the law of Evolution
that asserted itself; the progress of mental unfolding, differentiated
from spirit, involved and entangled already with matter, into which it
is irresistibly drawn. Ideas, in their very nature and essence, as
conceptions bearing relation to objects, whether true or imaginary, are
opposed to absolute THOUGHT, that unknowable ALL of whose mysterious
operations Mr. Spencer predicates that nothing can be said, but that "it
has no kinship of nature with Evolution" (*Principles of
Psychology,*\*\*\*\* 474) -- which it certainly has not.

The *Zohar* gives it very suggestively. When the "Holy One" (the Logos)
desired to create man, he called the *highest* host of Angels and said
to them what he wanted, but they *doubted* the wisdom of this desire and
answered: "Man will not continue one night in his glory" -- for

Idealist be right, the doctrine of evolution is a dream," says Mr.
Herbert Spencer. (See foot note, pp. 1 and 2, Book **II**.)

which they were burnt (annihilated?), by the "Holy" Lord. Then he called
another, lower Host, and said the same. And they contradicted the "Holy
One": "What is the good of Man?" they argued. Still Elohim created man,
and when man *sinned* there came the hosts of Uzza and Azael, and
twitted God: "Here is the Son of Man that thou hast made," they said.
"Behold, he sinned!" Then the Holy One replied: "If you had been among
them (men) you would have been worse than they." And he threw them from
their exalted position in Heaven even down on the Earth; and "they were
changed (into men) and sinned after the women of the earth"; (*Zohar,*
9, b.). This is quite plain. No mention is made in *Genesis* of these
"Sons of God" (chap. vi.) having been *punished* for it. The only
reference to it in the Bible is in Jude (6). "And the angels which kept
not their first estate but left their habitation, he hath reserved in
*everlasting chains under darkness* *unto the judgment of the great
day."* And this means simply that the "Angels," doomed to incarnation,
*are in the chains* of flesh and matter, under the *darkness of
ignorance,* till the "Great Day," which will come as always after the
seventh round, after the expiration of the "Week," on the **S**EVENTH
**S**ABBATH, or in the post-Manvantaric Nirvana.

How truly esoteric and consonant with the Secret Doctrine is
"**P**YMANDER the Thought Divine" of Hermes, may be inferred from its
original and primitive translations in Latin and Greek only. On the
other hand how disfigured it has been later on by Christians in Europe,
is seen from the remarks and unconscious *confessions* made by de St.
Marc, in his *Preface* and letter to the Bishop of Ayre, in 1578.
Therein, the whole cycle of transformations from a Pantheistic and
Egyptian into a mystic Roman Catholic treatise is given, and we see how
**P**YMANDER has become what it is now. Still, even in St. Marc's
translation, traces are found of the real **P**YMANDER -- the "Universal
Thought" or "**M**IND." This is the *verbatim* translation from the old
French translation, the original being given in the foot-note\* in its
quaint old French: --

"Seven men (principles) were generated in Man." "The nature of the
harmony of the Seven of the Father and of the Spirit. Nature . . . .

###### \[\[Footnote(s)\]\] -------------------------------------------------

And a gap is made in the translation, which can be filled partially by
resorting to the Latin text of Apuleius. The commentator, the Bishop,
says: "Nature produced in him (man) seven men" (seven principles).

Spirits" "having in them, potentially, the two sexes."

Metaphysically, the Father and the Son are the "Universal Mind" and the
"periodical Universe"; the "Angel" and the "Man." It is the **S**ON and
the **F**ATHER at one and the same time; in Pymander, the *active* IDEA
and the *passive* THOUGHT that generates it; the radical key-note in
Nature which gives birth to the seven notes -- the septenary scale of
the creative Forces, and to the seven prismatic *aspects* of colour, all
born from the one *white ray,* or **L**IGHT -- itself generated in
DARKNESS.
