<H4><STRONG>T</STRONG>HE <STRONG>M</STRONG>ANY <STRONG>M</STRONG>EANINGS
OF THE &quot;<STRONG>W</STRONG>AR IN <STRONG>H</STRONG>EAVEN.&quot;
</H4>

<P>
The Secret Doctrine points out, as a self-evident fact, that Mankind,
collectively and individually, is, with all manifested nature,
the vehicle (<EM>a</EM>)<EM> </EM>of the breath of One Universal
Principle, in its primal differentiation; and (<EM>b</EM>) of
the countless &quot;breaths&quot; proceeding from that One <STRONG>B</STRONG>REATH
in its secondary and further differentiations, as Nature with
its many <EM>mankinds </EM>proceeds downwards toward the planes
that are ever increasing in materiality. The primary Breath informs
the higher Hierarchies; the secondary -- the lower, on the constantly
descending planes.
<P>
Now there are many passages in the Bible which prove on their
face, <EM>exoterically, </EM>that this belief was at one time
<EM>Universal</EM>;<EM> </EM>and the most convincing are the two
chapters Ezekiel xxviii. and Isaiah xiv. Christian theologians
are welcome to interpret both as referring to the great War before
Creation, the Epos of Satan's rebellion, etc., if they so choose,
but the absurdity of the idea is too apparent. Ezekiel addresses
his lamentations and reproofs to the King of Tyre; Isaiah -- to
King Ahaz, who indulged in the worship of idols, as did the rest
of the nation, with the exception of a few Initiates (the <EM>Prophets,
</EM>so called), who tried to arrest it on its way to exotericism,
or idolatry, which is the same thing. Let the student judge.
<P>
In <I>Ezekiel</I> xxviii. it is said, &quot;Son of Man, say unto
the prince of Tyrus, thus saith the Lord God (as we understand
it, the &quot;god&quot; <STRONG>K</STRONG>ARMA): Because thine
heart <EM>is </EM>lifted up, and thou hast said I <I>am </I>a
God . . . . and yet thou <EM>art </EM>a man . . . . behold I shall
bring strangers upon thee . . . . and they shall draw their swords
against the beauty of thy wisdom . . . . and they shall bring
thee down to the pit . . . .&quot; or Earth-life.
<P>
The origin of the &quot;prince of Tyrus&quot; is to be traced
to, and sought in<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 493 THE REAL MEANING OF THE CHERUB.</H6>

<P>
the &quot;divine Dynasties&quot; of the iniquitous Atlanteans,
the Great Sorcerers (See last Comments, on Stanza <STRONG>XII</STRONG>.,
verses 47-49). There is no metaphor in the words of Ezekiel, but
actual <EM>history, </EM>this time. For the voice <EM>in</EM>
the prophet, the voice of the &quot;Lord,&quot; his own Spirit,
which spake unto him, says: -- &quot;Because thou hast said, 'I
<EM>am</EM> a God, I sit in the seat of God(s) -- (divine Dynasties),
in <EM>the midst of the seas</EM>,' yet thou art a man. . . .
. Behold thou <EM>art </EM>wiser than Daniel; there is no secret
that they can hide from thee: with thy wisdom . . . thou hast
increased thy riches, and thine heart is lifted up because of
thy riches. Behold therefore . . . strangers shall draw their
swords against the beauty of thy wisdom . . . they shall bring
thee down . . . and thou shalt die the deaths <EM>of them that
are </EM>slain <EM>in the midst of the seas.</EM>&quot; (Verses
3-8.) All such imprecations are not <EM>prophecy, </EM>but simply
<EM>reminders </EM>of the fate of the Atlanteans, the &quot;Giants
on Earth.&quot;
<P>
What can be the meaning of this last sentence if it is not a narrative
of the fate of the Atlanteans? Verse 17 saying, &quot;thine heart
was lifted up because of thy beauty,&quot; may refer to the &quot;Heavenly
Man&quot; in Pymander, or to the Fallen Angels, who are accused
of having fallen through pride on account of the great beauty
and wisdom which became their lot. There is no metaphor here,
except in the preconceived ideas of our theologians, perhaps.
These verses relate to the Past and belong more to the Knowledge
acquired at the mysteries of Initiation than to retrospective
clairvoyance! Says the voice, again: --
<P>
&quot;Thou hast been in Eden, the garden of God (in the Satya
Yuga) every precious stone was thy covering . . . . the workmanship
of thy tabrets and thy pipes <EM>was prepared in thee </EM>in
the day <EM>thou was created</EM>. . . <EM>Thou art the anointed
cherub</EM> . . . thou hast walked up and down in the midst of
the stones of fire . . . thou wast perfect in thy ways from the
day that thou wast created, till iniquity was found in thee. Therefore
I will cast thee out of the <EM>mountain of God </EM>and destroy
thee. . . . &quot;
<P>
The &quot;Mountain of God&quot; means the &quot;Mountain of <EM>the
Gods</EM>&quot;<EM> or</EM><I> </I>Meru, whose representative
in the Fourth Race was Mount Atlas, the <EM>last form of one of
the divine Titans, </EM>so high in those days that the ancients
believed that the heavens rested on its top. Did not Atlas assist
the giants in their war against the gods? (Hyginus). Another version
shows the <EM>fable </EM>as arising from the fondness of Atlas,
son of Iapetus and Clymene, for astronomy, and from his dwelling
for that reason on the highest mountain peaks. The truth is that
Atlas, &quot;the mountain of the gods,&quot; and also the hero
of that name, are the esoteric symbols of the Fourth Race, and
his seven daughters, the Atlantides, are the symbols of its Seven
Sub-races. Mount Atlas, according to all the legends, was three
times as high as it is now; having sunk at two different times.
It is of a volcanic origin, and therefore the voice <HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 494 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</H6>

<P>
within Ezekiel says: &quot;I will <EM>bring forth a fire from
the midst of thee, </EM>it shall devour thee,&quot; etc. (v. 18).
Surely it does not mean, as seems to be the case from the translated
texts, that this fire was to be brought from the midst of the
Prince of Tyrus, or his people, but from Mount Atlas, symbolising
the proud race, learned in magic and high in arts and civilization,
whose last remnant was destroyed almost at the foot of the range
of those once gigantic mountains.
<P>
Truly, &quot;thou shalt be a terror, and never <EM>shalt </EM>thou
be <EM>any more</EM>&quot;;<EM> as</EM><I> </I>the very name of
the race and its fate is now annihilated from man's memory. Bear
in mind, that almost every ancient King and priest was an initiate;
that from toward the close of the Fourth Race there had been a
feud between the Initiates of the <EM>Right </EM>and those of
the <EM>Left </EM>Path; finally, that the garden of Eden is referred
to by other personages than the Jews of the <EM>Adamic </EM>race,
since even Pharaoh is compared to the fairest tree of Eden by
this same Ezekiel, who shows &quot;all the trees of Eden, the
choicest and best of Lebanon, . . . comforted in the nether parts
of the earth . . . ,&quot; for &quot;they also went down into
hell with him&quot; (Pharaoh)* unto the nether parts, which are
in fact the bottom of the ocean, whose floor gaped wide to devour
the lands of the Atlanteans and themselves. If one bears all this
in mind and compares the various accounts, then one will find
out that the whole of chapters xxviii. and xxxi. of Ezekiel relate
neither to Babylon, Assyria, nor yet Egypt, since none of these
have been so destroyed, but simply fell into ruins on the <EM>surface,</EM>
not<EM> beneath </EM>the earth -- but indeed to Atlantis and most
of its nations. And he will see that the &quot;garden of Eden&quot;
of the Initiates was no myth, but a locality now submerged. Light
will dawn upon him, and he will appreciate such sentences as these
at their true esoteric value: &quot;Thou hast been in Eden; .
. . thou wast upon the holy mountain of God&quot; -- for every
nation had and many still have <I>holy</I> mountains: some, Himalayan
Peaks, others, Parnassus, and Sinai. They were all places of initiation
and the abodes of the <EM>chiefs </EM>of the communities of ancient
and even modern adepts. And again: &quot;Behold, the Assyrian
(why not Atlantean, Initiate?) was a cedar in Lebanon; . . . <EM>his
height was exalted above all the trees</EM>;<EM> </EM>. . . .
the cedars in the garden of God could not hide him, . . . so that
all the trees of Eden . . . . envied him&quot; (Ezekiel xxxi.
3-9).
<P>
Throughout all Asia Minor, the Initiates were called the &quot;trees
of Righteousness,&quot; and the cedars of Lebanon, as also were
some kings of Israel. So were the great adepts in India, but only
the adepts of the

<P>
* The only Pharaoh whom the Bible shows going down into the Red
Sea was the king who pursued the Israelites, and who remained
unnamed, for very good reasons, perhaps. The story was surely
made up from the Atlantean legend.<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 495 VARIOUS NAMES FOR INITIATES.</H6>

<P>
left hand. When Vishnu Purana narrates that &quot;the world was
overrun with trees,&quot; while the Prachetasas -- who &quot;passed
10,000 years of austerity in the vast ocean&quot; -- were absorbed
in their devotions, the allegory relates to the Atlanteans and
the adepts of the early Fifth Race -- the Aryans. Other &quot;<EM>trees
</EM>(adept Sorcerers) spread, and overshadowed the unprotected
earth; and the people perished . . . unable to labour for ten
thousand years.&quot; Then the sages, the Rishis of the Aryan
race, called Prachetasas, are shown &quot;coming forth <EM>from
the</EM> <EM>deep,</EM>&quot;<EM>* </EM>and destroying by the
wind and flame issuing from their mouths, the iniquitous &quot;trees&quot;
and the whole vegetable kingdom; until Soma (the moon), the sovereign
of the vegetable world, pacifies them by making alliance with
the adepts of the <EM>Right </EM>Path, to whom he offers as bride
Marisha, &quot;the offspring of the trees.&quot;** This means
that which is given in the Stanzas and Commentaries, and what
is also given in Part <STRONG>II</STRONG>. of Vol. I., &quot;The
Sacred Island.&quot; It hints at the great struggle between the
&quot;Sons of God&quot; and the Sons of the Dark Wisdom -- our
forefathers; or the Atlantean and the Aryan Adepts.
<P>
The whole History of that period is allegorized in the <EM>Ramayana,</EM>
which is the mystic narrative in epic form of the struggle between
Rama -- the first king of the <EM>divine</EM> dynasty of the early
Aryans -- and Ravana, the symbolical personation of the Atlantean
(Lanka) race. The former were the incarnations of the Solar Gods;
the latter, of the lunar Devas. This was the great battle between
Good and Evil, between white and black magic, for the supremacy
of the divine forces, or of the lower terrestrial or cosmic powers.
If the student would understand better the last statement, let
him turn to the <EM>Anugita </EM>episode of the Mahabharata, chapter
v., where the Brahmana tells his wife, &quot;I have perceived
by means of the Self the seat abiding in the Self -- (the seat)
where dwells the Brahman free from the pairs of opposites and
the moon, together with the fire (or the sun), upholding (all)
beings (as), the mover of the intellectual principle.&quot; The
moon <EM>is</EM> the deity of the mind (Manas) but only on the
lower plane. &quot;Manas is dual -- <EM>lunar </EM>in the lower,
<EM>solar </EM>in its upper portion,&quot; says a commentary.
That is to say, it is attracted in its higher aspect towards Buddhi,
and in its
<H6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
</H6>

<P>
* Vishnu Purana, Book I., ch. xv.
<P>
** This is pure allegory. The waters are a symbol of wisdom and
of occult learning. Hermes represented the sacred Science under
the symbol of <EM>fire</EM>; the Northern Initiates, under that
of water. The latter is the production of <EM>Nara</EM>, the &quot;Spirit
of God,&quot; or rather <EM>Paramatman</EM>, the &quot;Supreme
Soul,&quot; says Kulluka Bhatta, Narayana, meaning &quot;he who
abides in the deep&quot; or plunged in the Waters of Wisdom --
&quot;water being the body of Nara&quot; (<EM>Vayu</EM>). Hence
arises the statement that for 10,000 years they remained in austerity
&quot;in the vast Ocean&quot;; and are shown emerging from it.
Ea, the God of Wisdom, is the &quot;Sublime Fish,&quot; and Dagon
or Oannes is the Chaldean man-fish, who emerges from the waters
to teach wisdom.<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 496 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</H6>

<P>
lower descends into, and listens to the voice of its <EM>animal
</EM>soul full of selfish and sensual desires; and herein is contained
the mystery of an adept's as of a profane man's life, as also
that of the <EM>post-mortem </EM>separation of the divine from
the animal man. The Ramayana -- every line of which has to be
read esoterically -- discloses in magnificent symbolism and allegory
the tribulations of both man and soul. &quot;Within the body,
in the midst of all these life-winds (? principles), which move
about in the body, and swallow up one another,* blazes the Vaishvana
fire** sevenfold, of which 'I' am the goal,&quot; says the Brahmana.***
<P>
But the chief &quot;Soul&quot; is <EM>Manas </EM>or mind; hence,
Soma, the moon, is shown as making an alliance with the solar
portion in it, personified as the Prachetasas. But of the seven
keys that open the seven aspects of the Ramayana, as of every
other Scripture, this is only one -- the metaphysical.
<P>
The symbol of the &quot;Tree&quot; standing for various Initiates
was almost universal. Jesus is called &quot;the tree of Life,&quot;
as also all the adepts of the good Law, while those of the <EM>left
</EM>Path are referred to as the &quot;withering trees.&quot;
John the Baptist speaks of &quot;the axe&quot; which &quot;is
laid to the root of the trees&quot; (Matth. iii. 10); and the
King of Assyria's armies are called <EM>trees </EM>(Isaiah x.
19).
<P>
The true meaning of the Garden of Eden was sufficiently given
in &quot;<EM>Isis Unveiled.</EM>&quot;
<P>
The writer has more than once heard surprise expressed that <EM>Isis</EM>
should contain so few of the doctrines now taught. This is quite
erroneous. For the allusions to such teachings are plentiful,
even if the teachings themselves were still withheld. The time
had not arrived then, as the hour has not struck now <EM>to say
all. </EM>&quot;No Atlanteans, or the Fourth Race which preceded
our Fifth Race, are mentioned in '<EM>Isis Unveiled,</EM>'<EM>
</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>a critic on &quot;Esoteric Buddhism&quot;
wrote one day. I, who wrote <EM>Isis Unveiled, </EM>maintain that
the Atlanteans <EM>are </EM>mentioned as our predecessors, namely,
in Volume I., p. 133, when speaking of the Book of Job. For what
can be plainer than this: &quot;In the original text, instead
of 'dead things,' it is written dead <EM>Rephaim,</EM> giants,
or mighty primitive men, from whom 'Evolution' <EM>may one</EM>
<EM>day trace our present race.</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>It is invited
to do so now, now that this hint is explained quite openly; but
Evolutionists are as sure to
<H6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
</H6>

<P>
* This is explained by the able translator of Anugita in a foot-note
(p. 258) in these words: &quot;The sense appears to be this; the
course of worldly life is due to the operations of the life-winds
which are attached to the <STRONG>SELF</STRONG>, and lead to its
manifestations as individual souls.

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 497 TRACES OF PRE-HISTORIC STRIFES.</H6>

<P>
decline nowadays as they did ten years ago. Science and theology
are against us: therefore we question both, and have to do so
in self-defence. On the strength of hazy metaphors scattered throughout
the prophets, and in St. John's Revelation, a grand but re-edited
version of the Book of Enoch, on these insecure grounds Christian
theology built its dogmatic Epos of the War in Heaven. It did
more: it used the symbolical visions, intelligible only to the
Initiates, as pillars upon which to support the whole bulky edifice
of its religion; and now the pillars have been found very weak
reeds, and the cunning structure is foundering. The entire Christian
scheme rests upon these <EM>Jakin </EM>and <EM>Boaz</EM> -- the
two contrary forces of good and evil, Christ and Satan the [[<EM>agathai
kai kakai dunameis</EM>]]. Take away from Christianity its main
prop of the Fallen Angels, and the Eden Bower vanishes with its
Adam and Eve into thin air; and Christ, in the exclusive character
of the One God and Saviour, and the victim of Atonement for the
Sin of animal-man, becomes forthwith a useless, meaningless myth.
<P>
In an old number of the <EM>Revue Archaeologique </EM>for the
year 1845 (p. 41), a French writer, M. Maury, remarks: -- &quot;This
universal strife between good and bad spirits seems to be only
the reproduction of <EM>another more ancient and more terrible
strife, </EM>that, according to an ancient myth, took place before
the creation of the universe, between the faithful and the rebellious
legions.&quot;
<P>
Once more, it is a simple question of priority. Had John's <EM>Revelation</EM>
been written during the Vedic period, and were not one sure now
of its being simply another version of the <EM>Book of Enoch </EM>and
the Dragon legends of pagan antiquity -- the grandeur and the
beauty of the imagery might have biased the critics' opinion in
favour of the Christian interpretation of that first war, whose
battle field was starry Heaven, and the first slaughterers --
the Angels. As the matter stands now, however, one has to trace
Revelation, event by event, to other and far older visions. For
the better comprehension of the Apocalyptic allegories and of
the esoteric <EM>epos </EM>we ask the reader to turn to <EM>Revelation,</EM>
and to read chapter xii., from verse 1 to verse 7.
<P>
This has several meanings, most of which have been found out with
regard to the astronomical and numerical keys of this universal
myth. That which may be given now, is a fragment, a few hints
as to its secret meaning, as embodying the record of a real war,
the struggle between the Initiates of the two schools. Many and
various are the still existing allegories built on that same foundation
stone. The true narrative, that which gives the full esoteric
meaning, is in the Secret books, but the writer has had no access
to these.
<P>
In the exoteric works, however, the episode of the Taraka war,
and some esoteric commentaries, may offer a clue perhaps. In every
Purana<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 498 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</H6>

<P>
the event is described with more or less variations, which show
its allegorical character.
<P>
In the Mythology of the earliest Vedic Aryans as in the later
<EM>Puranic</EM> narratives, mention is made of Budha, the &quot;Wise&quot;;
one &quot;learned in the <EM>Secret </EM>Wisdom,&quot; and who
is the planet Mercury in his euhemerization. The <EM>Hindu Classical
Dictionary </EM>credits Budha with being the author of a hymn
in the Rig Veda. Therefore, he can by no means be &quot;a later
fiction of the Brahmins,&quot; but is a very old personation indeed.
<P>
It is by inquiring into his genealogy, or theogony, rather, that
the following facts are disclosed. As a myth, he is the son of
Tara, the wife of Brihaspati the &quot;gold coloured,&quot; and
of &quot;Soma&quot; the (male) Moon, who, Paris-like, carries
this new Helen of the Hindu sidereal Kingdom away from her husband,
which causes a great strife and <EM>war</EM> in Swarga (Heaven).
The episode brings on a battle between the gods and the Asuras:
King Soma, finds allies in Usanas (Venus), the leader of the Danavas;
and the gods are led by Indra and Rudra, who side with Brihaspati.
The latter is helped by Sankara (Siva), who, having had for his
guru Brihaspati's father, Angiras, befriends his son. Indra is
here the Indian prototype of Michael, the Archistrategus and the
slayer of the &quot;Dragon's&quot; angels -- since one of his
names is <EM>Jishnu</EM> &quot;leader of the (celestial) Host.&quot;
Both fight, as some Titans did against other Titans in defence
of revengeful gods, one -- of Jupiter <EM>tonans </EM>(in India,
Brihaspati is the planet Jupiter, which is a curious coincidence);
the other, in support of the ever-thundering Rudra Sankara. During
this war, he is deserted by his body-guard, the storm-gods (Maruts).
The story is very suggestive in some of its details.
<P>
Let us examine some of them, and seek to discover their meaning.
<P>
The presiding genius, or &quot;regent&quot; of the planet Jupiter
is Brihaspati, the wronged husband. He is the instructor or spiritual
guru of the gods, who are the representatives of the procreative
powers. In the Rig Veda, he is called <EM>Brahmanaspati, </EM>a
name meaning &quot;the deity in whom <EM>the action of the worshipped
</EM>upon the gods is personified.&quot; Hence Brahmanaspati represents
the materialization of the <EM>divine grace, </EM>so to say, by
means of ritual and ceremonies, or the exoteric worship.
<P>
&quot;<STRONG>T</STRONG>ARA&quot;* -- his wife -- is on the other
hand the personification of the powers of one initiated into <EM>Gupta
Vidya </EM>(secret knowledge), as will be shown.
<P>
<STRONG>S</STRONG>OMA is the moon astronomically; but in mystical
phraseology, it is also the name of the sacred beverage drunk
by the Brahmins and the Initiates during their mysteries and sacrificial
rites. The &quot;Soma&quot; plant is the<EM> asclepias acida,
</EM>which yields a juice from which that mystic beverage,
<H6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
</H6>

<P>
* See Dowson's <EM>Classical Dictionary.</EM> <HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 499 ALLEGORIES ON THE &quot;WAR IN HEAVEN.&quot;
</H6>

<P>
the<EM> Soma </EM>drink, is made. Alone the descendants of the
Rishis, the <EM>Agnihotri </EM>(the fire priests) of the great
mysteries knew all its powers. But the real property of the true
Soma was (and <EM>is</EM>)<EM> </EM>to make a new <EM>man </EM>of
the Initiate, after he is <EM>reborn, </EM>namely once that he
begins to live in his <EM>astral </EM>body (See &quot;The Elixir
of Life&quot;*); for, his spiritual nature overcoming the physical,
he would soon snap it off and part even from that etherealized
form.**
<P>
Soma was never given in days of old to the non-initiated Brahman
-- the simple <EM>Grihasta, </EM>or priest of the exoteric ritual.
Thus Brihaspati -- &quot;guru of the gods&quot; though he was
-- still represented the dead-letter form of worship. It is Tara
<EM>his wife -- </EM>the symbol of one who, though wedded to dogmatic
worship, longs for true wisdom -- who is shown as initiated into
his mysteries by King <EM>Soma, </EM>the giver of that Wisdom.
Soma is thus made in the allegory <EM>to carry her away. </EM>The
result of this is the birth of Budha -- <EM>esoteric Wisdom --
</EM>(Mercury, or Hermes in Greece and Egypt). He is represented
as &quot;so beautiful,&quot; that even the husband, though well
aware that Budha is not the progeny of his <EM>dead-letter</EM>
worship -- claims the &quot;new-born&quot; as his Son, the fruit
of his ritualistic and meaningless forms.*** Such is, <EM>in brief,
one </EM>of the meanings of the allegory.
<P>
<EM>War in Heaven </EM>refers to several events of that kind on
various and different planes of being. The first is a purely astronomical
and cosmical fact pertaining to cosmogony. Mr. John Bentley thought
that with the Hindus <EM>war in Heaven </EM>is only a figure referring
to their calculations of time periods (see Bentley's <EM>Hindu
Astronomy</EM>)<EM>.*</EM>***
<H6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
</H6>

<P>
* See &quot;Five Years of Theosophy.&quot;
<P>
** The partaker of <EM>Soma </EM>finds himself both linked to
his external body, and yet away from it in his spiritual form.
The latter, freed from the former, soars for the time being in
the ethereal higher regions, becoming virtually &quot;as one of
the gods,&quot; and yet preserving in his physical brain the memory
of what he sees and learns. Plainly speaking, <EM>Soma </EM>is
the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge forbidden by the jealous Elohim
to Adam and Eve or <EM>Yah-ve</EM>, &quot;lest Man should become
as one of us.&quot;
<P>
*** We see the same in the modern exoteric religions.
<P>
<EM>**** &quot;Historical Views of Hindu Astronomy.</EM>&quot;<EM>
</EM>Quoting from the work in reference to Aryachatta, who is
said to give a near approach to the true relation among the various
values for the computations of the value of [[<I>pi</I>]], the
author of the &quot;Source of Measures&quot; reproduces a curious
statement. Mr. Bentley, it is said, &quot;was greatly familiar
with the Hindu astronomical and mathematical knowledge . . . this
statement of his then may be taken as authentic: the same remarkable
trait, among so many Eastern and ancient nations of <EM>sedulously
concealing the arcana of this kind of knowledge, is</EM> <EM>a
marked one </EM>among the Hindus. That which was given out to
be popularly taught and to be exposed to public inspection, <EM>was
but the approximate of a more exact but hidden</EM> <EM>knowledge.
</EM>And this very formulation of Mr. Bentley will strangely exemplify
the assertion; and explained, will show that it (the Hindu <I>exoteric</I>
astronomy and sciences) was derived <EM>from a system exact beyond
the European one, </EM>in which Mr. Bentley himself, of [[footnote
continued on following page]]<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 500 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</H6>

<P>
This served as a prototype, he thinks, for the Western nations
to build their <EM>war of the Titans </EM>upon. The author is
not quite wrong, but neither is he quite right. If the sidereal
prototype refers indeed to a <I>pre</I>-manvantaric period, and
rests entirely on the Knowledge claimed by the Aryan Initiates
of the whole programme and progress of cosmogony,* the <EM>war
of the Titans </EM>is but a legendary and deified copy of the
real war that took place in the Himalayan <EM>Kailasa </EM>(heaven)
instead of in the depths of Cosmic interplanetary Space. It is
the record of the terrible strife between the &quot;Sons of God&quot;
and the &quot;Sons of the Shadow&quot; of the Fourth and the Fifth
Races. It is on these two events, blended together by legends
borrowed from the exoteric account of the war waged by the Asuras
against the gods, that every subsequent national tradition on
the subject has been built.
<P>
Esoterically, the <EM>Asuras, </EM>transformed subsequently into
evil Spirits and lower gods, who are eternally at war with the
<I>great</I> deities -- are the gods of the Secret Wisdom. In
the oldest portions of the Rig Veda, they are the spiritual and

(See Darmesteter's <STRONG>V</STRONG>ENDIDAD). There was a time
when the gods Indra, Agni, and Varuna themselves belonged to the
<EM>Asuras.</EM> 
<P>
In the Aitareya Brahmana, the breath (<EM>asu</EM>)<EM> </EM>of
Brahma-Prajapati became alive, and from that breath he created
the Asuras. Later on, after the war, the Asuras are called the
enemies of the gods, hence -- &quot;A-suras,&quot; the initial
&quot;A&quot; being a negative prefix -- or &quot;<EM>no</EM>-gods&quot;
-- the &quot;gods&quot; being referred to as &quot;Suras.&quot;
This then connects the <EM>Asuras</EM> and their &quot;Hosts,&quot;
enumerated further on, with the &quot;Fallen Angels&quot; of the
Christian Churches, a hierarchy of spiritual Beings to be found
in every Pantheon of ancient and even modern nations -- from the
Zoroastrian down to that of the Chinaman. They are the sons of
the primeval Creative Breath at the beginning of every new Maha
Kalpa, or Manvantara; in the same rank as the Angels who had remained
&quot;faithful.&quot; These <EM>were the allies of Soma </EM>(the

Which is Mr. Bentley's misfortune, and does not take away from

* The Secret Doctrine teaches that every event of universal importance,
such as geological cataclysms at the end of one race and the beginning
of a new one, involving a great change each time in mankind, spiritual,
moral and physical -- is pre-cogitated and preconcerted, so to
say, in the sidereal regions of our planetary system. Astrology
is built wholly upon this mystic and intimate connection between
the heavenly bodies and mankind; and it is one of the great secrets
of Initiation and Occult mysteries.<HR>

worship). Evidently they have been degraded in Space and Time
into opposing powers or demons by the ceremonialists, on account
of their rebellion against hypocrisy, sham-worship, and the dead-letter
form.
<P>
Now what is the real character of all those who fought along with
them? They are (1) the<EM> Usanas, </EM>or the &quot;host&quot;
of the planet Venus, become now in Roman Catholicism -- <EM>Lucifer,
</EM>the genius of the &quot;morning star&quot; (see Isaiah xiv.,
12), the<EM> tsaba, </EM>or army of &quot;Satan.&quot; (2) The
<EM>Daityas </EM>and<EM> Danavas </EM>are the Titans, the demons
and giants whom we find in the Bible (<EM>Gen. </EM>vi.) -- the
progeny of the &quot;Sons of God&quot; and the &quot;Daughters
of Men.&quot; Their generic name shows their alleged character,
and discloses at the same time the secret <EM>animus </EM>of the
Brahmins: for they are the <EM>Krati-dwishas -- </EM>the &quot;enemies
of the sacrifices&quot; or exoteric <EM>shams. </EM>These are
the &quot;hosts&quot; that fought against Brihaspati, the representative
of <EM>exoteric </EM>popular and national religions; and Indra
-- the god of the <EM>visible </EM>heaven, the firmament, who,
in the early <EM>Veda, </EM>is the <EM>highest </EM>god of Cosmic
heaven, the fit habitation for an <EM>extra</EM>-Cosmic and personal
God, higher than whom no exoteric worship can ever soar.
<P>
(3) Then come the Nagas,* the <EM>Sarpa </EM>(serpents or Seraphs).
These, again, show their character by the hidden meaning of their
glyph. In Mythology they are <EM>semi-divine </EM>beings with
a human face and the tail of a Dragon. They are therefore, undeniably,
the Jewish <EM>seraphim </EM>(from <EM>Serapis </EM>and<EM> Sarpa,
</EM>Serpent); the plural being <EM>saraph, </EM>&quot;burning,
fiery&quot; (See Isaiah, vi. 23). Christian and Jewish angelology
distinguishes between the Seraphim and the <EM>Cherubim </EM>or
Cherubs, who come second in order; esoterically, and Kabalistically,
they are identical; the <EM>cherubim </EM>being simply the name
for the images or likenesses of any of the divisions of the celestial
hosts. Now, as said before, the Dragons and <EM>Nagas </EM>were
the names given to the Initiates-hermits, on account of their
great Wisdom and Spirituality and their living in caves. Thus,
when Ezekiel applies the adjective of <EM>Cherub </EM>to the King
of Tyre, and tells him that by his <EM>wisdom </EM>and his <EM>understanding
</EM>there is <EM>no secret </EM>that can be hidden from him (v.
3, 4, xxviii.), he shows to an Occultist that it is a &quot;prophet,&quot;
perhaps, still a follower of <EM>exoteric </EM>worship, who fulminates
against an <EM>Initiate </EM>of another school and not against
an imaginary Lucifer, a fallen cherub from the stars, and then
from the garden of Eden. Thus the so-called &quot;war&quot; is,
in one of its many meanings, also an allegorical record of the
strife between the two classes of adepts -- of the right and of
the left path. There were three classes of Rishis in India, who
were
<H6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
</H6>

<P>
* <EM>The Nagas </EM>are described by the Orientalists as a mysterious
people whose landmarks are found abundantly in India to this day,
and who lived in <EM>Naga dwipa </EM>one of the <I>Seven</I> continents
or divisions of <EM>Bharatavarsha </EM>(old India), the town of
Nagpur being one of the most ancient cities in the country.<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 502 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</H6>

<P>
the earliest adepts known; the royal, or Rajarshis, kings and
princes, who adopted the ascetic life; the Devarshis, divine,
or the sons of Dharma or Yoga; and Brahmarshis, descendants of
those Rishis who were the founders of <EM>gotras </EM>of Brahmans,
or caste-races. Now, leaving the mythical and astronomical keys
for one moment aside, the secret teachings show many Atlanteans
who belonged to these divisions; and there were strifes and wars
between them, <EM>de facto </EM>and<EM> de jure. </EM>Narada,
one of the greatest Rishis, was a <EM>Devarishi</EM>;<EM> </EM>and
he is shown in constant and everlasting feud with Brahma, Daksha,
and other gods and sages. Therefore we may safely maintain that
whatever the <EM>astronomical </EM>meaning of this universally
accepted legend, its human phase is based on real and historical
events, disfigured into a theological dogma only to suit ecclesiastical
purposes. As above so below. Sidereal phenomena, and the behaviour
of the celestial bodies in the heavens, were taken as a model,
and the plan was carried out below, on earth. Thus, space, in
its abstract sense, was called &quot;the realm of divine knowledge,&quot;
and by the <EM>Chaldees </EM>or Initiates <EM>Ab Soo, </EM>the
habitat (or Father, <EM>i.e.</EM>, the source) of knowledge, because
it is in space that dwell the intelligent Powers which <EM>invisibly
</EM>rule the Universe.*
<P>
In the same manner and on the plan of the Zodiac in the <EM>upper</EM>
Ocean or the heavens, a certain realm on Earth, an inland sea,
was consecrated and called &quot;the Abyss of Learning&quot;;
twelve centres on it in the shape of twelve small islands representing
the Zodiacal signs -- two of which remained for ages the &quot;mystery
signs&quot;** and were the abodes of twelve Hierophants and masters
of wisdom. This &quot;sea of knowledge&quot; or learning*** remained
for ages there, where now stretches the Shamo, or Gobi desert.
It existed until the last great glacial period, when a

* Not less suggestive are the qualities attributed to Rudra Siva,
the great <EM>Yogi,</EM> the forefather of all the Adepts -- in
Esotericism one of the greatest Kings of the Divine Dynasties.
Called &quot;the Earliest&quot; and the &quot;Last,&quot; he is
the patron of the Third, Fourth, and the Fifth Root-Races. For,
in his earliest character, he is the ascetic <EM>Dig-ambara, </EM>&quot;clothed
with the Elements,&quot; <EM>Trilochana, </EM>&quot;the <I>three</I>-eyed&quot;;
<EM>Pancha-anana, </EM>&quot;the five-faced,&quot; an allusion
to the past four and the present fifth race, for, though <I>five</I>-faced,
he is only &quot;four-armed,&quot; as the fifth race is still
alive. He is the &quot;God of Time,&quot; Saturn-Kronos, as his
<I>damaru</I> (drum), in the shape of an hour-glass, shows; and
if he is accused of having cut off Brahma's fifth head, and left
him with only four, it is again an allusion to a certain degree
in initiation, and also to the Races.
<P>
** G. Seiffarth's idea that the signs of the Zodiac were in ancient
times only ten is erroneous. Ten only were known to the profane;
the initiates, however, knew them all, <EM>from the time of the
separation of mankind into sexes, </EM>whence arose the separation
of Virgo-Scorpio into two; which, owing to a secret sign added
and the <I>Libra </I>invented by the Greeks, instead of the secret
name which was not given, made 12. (<EM>Vide Isis Unveiled, </EM>Vol.

local cataclysm, which swept the waters south and west and so
formed the present great desolate desert, left only a certain
oasis, with a lake and one island in the midst of it, as a relic
of the <EM>Zodiacal Ring </EM>on Earth. For ages the watery abyss
-- which, with the nations that preceded the later Babylonians,
was the abode of the &quot;great mother&quot; (the terrestrial
post-type of the &quot;great mother chaos&quot; in heaven), the
parent of Ea (Wisdom), himself the early prototype of Oannes,
the man-Fish of the Babylonians -- for ages, then, the &quot;Abyss&quot;
or <EM>Chaos</EM> was the abode of wisdom and not of evil. The
struggle of Bel and then of Merodach, the Sun-god, with <EM>Tiamat,
</EM>the Sea and its Dragon, a &quot;war&quot; which ended in
the defeat of the latter, has a purely cosmic and geological meaning,
as well as an historical one. It is a page torn out of the History
of the Secret and Sacred Sciences, their evolution, growth and
DEATH -- <EM>for the profane masses. </EM>It relates (<EM>a</EM>)
to the systematic and gradual drying up of immense territories
by the fierce Sun at a certain pre-historic period; one of the
terrible droughts which ended by a gradual transformation of once
fertile lands abundantly watered into the sandy deserts which
they are now; and (<EM>b</EM>) to the as systematic persecution
of the Prophets of the Right Path by those of the Left. The latter,
having inaugurated the birth and evolution of the sacerdotal castes,
have finally led the world into all these exoteric religions,
invented to satisfy the depraved tastes of the &quot;<EM>hoi polloi</EM>&quot;<EM>
</EM>and the ignorant for ritualistic pomp and the materialization
of the ever-immaterial and Unknowable Principle.
<P>
This was a certain improvement on the Atlantean sorcery, the memory
of which lingers in the remembrances of all the literary and Sanskrit-speaking
portion of India, as well as in the popular legends. Still it
was a parody on, and the desecration of the Sacred Mysteries and
their science. The rapid progress of anthropomorphism and idolatry
led the early Fifth, as it had already led the Fourth Race, into
sorcery once more, though on a smaller scale. Finally, even <EM>the
four</EM> &quot;<EM>Adams</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>(symbolizing under
other names the four preceding races) were forgotten; and passing
from one generation into another, each loaded with some additional
myths, got at last drowned in that ocean of popular symbolism
called the Pantheons. Yet they exist to this day in the oldest
Jewish traditions, as the <EM>Tzelem, </EM>&quot;the Shadow-Adam&quot;
(the <EM>Chhayas </EM>of our doctrine); the &quot;model&quot;
Adam, the copy of the first, and the &quot;male and female&quot;
of the exoteric genesis (chap. i.); the third, the &quot;earthly
Adam&quot; before the Fall, an androgyne; and the Fourth -- the
Adam after <EM>his fall, i.e., </EM>separated into sexes, or the
pure Atlantean. The Adam of the garden of Eden, or the forefather
of our race -- the fifth -- is an ingenious compound of the above
four. As stated in <EM>Zohar</EM> (iii., fol. 4, col. 14, Cremona
Ed.) Adam, the FIRST <EM>man</EM>, is not found<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 504 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</H6>

<P>
now on earth, he &quot;is not found in all, below.&quot; Because,
&quot;where does the lower earth come from? <EM>From the chain
of the Earth, and heaven</EM> <EM>above,</EM>&quot;<EM> i.e.,
</EM>from the superior globes, those which precede and are above
our Earth. &quot;And there came out from it (the chain) creatures
of all kinds. Some of them in (solid) skins, some in shells (<EM>Klippoth</EM>)<EM>
. </EM>. . some in red shells, some in black, some in white, and
some of other colours . . . &quot; (See<EM> Qabbalah</EM>).
<P>
As in the Chaldean Cosmogony of Berosus and the Stanzas just given,
some treatises on the Kabala speak of creatures with two faces,
some with four, and some with one face: for &quot;the highest
Adam did not come down in all the countries, or produce progeny
and have many wives,&quot; but is a Mystery.
<P>
So is the Dragon a mystery. Truly, says Rabbi Simeon Ben-Iochai,
that to understand the meaning of the Dragon is not given to the
&quot;Companions&quot; (students, or <EM>chelas</EM>)<EM>, </EM>but
only to &quot;the little ones,&quot; <EM>i.e</EM>., the<EM> perfect
Initiates.* </EM>&quot;The work of the beginning the companions
understand; but it is only the little ones who understand the
parable on the work in the <EM>Principium </EM>by<EM> the mystery
of the serpent of the Great</EM> <EM>Sea.</EM>&quot;<EM>** </EM>And
those Christians, who may happen to read this, will also understand
by the light of the above sentence who their &quot;Christ&quot;
was. For Jesus states repeatedly that he who &quot;shall not receive
the Kingdom of God as a <EM>little child, </EM>he shall not enter
therein&quot;; and if some of his sayings have been meant to apply
to children without any metaphor, most of what relates to the
&quot;little ones&quot; in the Gospels, related to the <EM>Initiates,
of whom Jesus was one. </EM>Paul (Saul) is referred to in the
Talmud as &quot;the little one.&quot;
<P>
That &quot;Mystery of the Serpent&quot; was this: Our Earth, or
rather <EM>terrestrial life, </EM>is often referred to in the
Secret Teachings as the great Sea, &quot;the sea of life&quot;
having remained to this day a favourite metaphor. The <EM>Siphrah
Dzeniouta </EM>speaks of primeval chaos and the evolution of the
Universe after a destruction (<EM>pralaya</EM>), comparing it
to an uncoiling serpent: -- &quot;Extending hither and thither,
its tail in its mouth, the head twisting on its neck, it is enraged
and angry. . . It watches and conceals itself. <EM>Every thousand
Days </EM>it is manifested.&quot; (I., &#167; 16).
<P>
[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------

* Such was the name given in ancient Judea to the Initiates, called
also the &quot;Innocents&quot; and the &quot;Infants,&quot; <EM>i.e</EM>.,
once more reborn. This <EM>key </EM>opens a vista into one of
the New Testament mysteries; the slaughter by Herod of the 40,000
&quot;Innocents.&quot; There is a legend to this effect, and the
event which took place almost a century <STRONG>B.C.</STRONG>,
shows the origin of the tradition blended at the same time with
that of Krishna and his uncle Kansa. In the case of the N. T.,
Herod stands for Alexander Janneus (of Lyda), whose persecution
and murder of hundreds and thousands of Initiates led to the adoption
of the Bible story.

** Zohar ii., 34.<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 505 THE SACREDNESS OF THE SERPENT.</H6>

<P>
A commentary on the Puranas says: &quot;Ananta-Sesha is a form
of Vishnu, the Holy Spirit of Preservation, and a symbol of the
Universe, on which it is supposed to sleep during the intervals
of the <EM>Days </EM>of Brahma. The seven heads of Sesha support
the Universe. . . . &quot;
<P>
So the Spirit of God &quot;sleeps,&quot; is &quot;breathing&quot;
(meracha' pheth') over the Chaos of undifferentiated matter, before
each new &quot;Creation.&quot; (<EM>Siphrah Dzeniouta</EM>)<EM>.
</EM>Now one &quot;Day&quot; of Brahma is composed, as already
explained, of <EM>one thousand </EM>Mahayugas; and as each &quot;Night&quot;
or period of rest is equal in duration to this &quot;day,&quot;
it is easy to see to what this sentence in <EM>Siphrah Dzeniouta
</EM>refers, viz.: -- that the serpent manifests &quot;once in
a thousand days.&quot; Nor is it more difficult to see whither
the initiated writer of the <EM>Siphrah </EM>is leading us, when
he says: &quot;Its head is broken in the waters of the great sea,
as it is written: 'Thou dividest the sea by thy strength, thou
brakest the <EM>heads </EM>of the <EM>dragons</EM> in the waters'
&quot; (lxxiv. 13). It refers to the trials of the Initiates in
this physical life, the &quot;sea of sorrow,&quot; if read with
one key; it hints at the successive destruction of the seven spheres
of a chain of worlds in the great sea of space, when read with
another key: for every sidereal globe or sphere, every world,
star, or group of stars, is called in symbolism &quot;the Dragon's
head.&quot; But however it may read, the Dragon was never regarded
as Evil, nor was the Serpent either -- in antiquity. In the metaphors,
whether astronomical, cosmical, theogonical or simply physiological,
<EM>i.e.</EM>, phallic -- the Serpent was always regarded as a
<EM>divine </EM>symbol. When it is said &quot;The (Cosmic) Serpent
which runs with 370 leaps&quot; (<EM>Siphrah Dzeniouta</EM>, &#167;
33) it means the cyclic periods of the great Tropical year (25,868
years), divided in the esoteric calculation into 370 periods or
cycles, as one solar year is divided into 365 days. And if Michael
was regarded by the Christians as the Conqueror of Satan, the
Dragon, it is because in the Talmud this fighting personage is
represented as the Prince of Waters, who had seven subordinate
Spirits under him -- a good reason why the Latin Church made him
the patron Saint of every promontory in Europe. In the Kabala
(<EM>Siph. Dzen</EM>.)<EM> </EM>the creative Force &quot;makes
sketches and spiral lines of his creation <EM>in the</EM> <EM>shape
of a Serpent.</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>It &quot;holds its tail in its
mouth,&quot; because it is the symbol of endless eternity and
of cyclic periods. Its meanings, however, would require a volume,
and we must end.
<P>
Thus the reader may now see for himself what are the several meanings
of the &quot;War in Heaven,&quot; and of the &quot;great dragon.&quot;
The most solemn and dreaded of church dogmas, the alpha and omega
of Christian faith, and the pillar of its <STRONG>F</STRONG>ALL
and <STRONG>A</STRONG>TONEMENT, dwindles down to a pagan symbol,
in the many allegories about those prehistoric struggles.
