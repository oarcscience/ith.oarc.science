All that which precedes was known to Plato, and to many others. But as
no Initiate had the right to divulge and declare all he knew, posterity
got only hints. Aiming more to instruct as a moralist than as a
geographer and ethnologist or historian, the Greek philosopher merged
the history of Atlantis, which covered several million years, into one

event which he located on one comparatively small island 3000 stadia
long by 2000 wide; (or about 350 miles by 200, which is about the size
of Ireland), whereas the priests spoke of Atlantis as a continent vast
as "all Asia and Lybia" put together. But, however altered in its
general aspect, Plato's narrative bears the impress of truth upon it.\*
It was not he who invented it, at any rate, since Homer, who preceded
him by many centuries, also speaks of the Atlantes (who are our
Atlanteans) and of their island in his Odyssey. Therefore the tradition
was older than the bard of Ulysses. The Atlantes and the Atlantides of
mythology are based upon the Atlantes and the Atlantides of history.
Both Sanchoniathon and Diodorus have preserved the histories of those
heroes and heroines, however much these accounts may have become mixed
up with the mythical element.

In our own day we witness the stupendous fact that such comparatively
recent personages as Shakespeare and William Tell are all but denied, an
attempt being made to show one to be a *nom de plume,* and the other a
person who never existed. What wonder then, that the two powerful races
-- the Lemurians and the Atlanteans -- have been merged into and
identified, in time, with a few half mythical peoples, who all bore the
same patronymic?

Herodotus speaks of the *Atlantes --* a people of Western Africa which
gave its name to Mount Atlas; who were vegetarians, and "whose sleep was
never disturbed by dreams"; and who, moreover, "daily cursed the sun at
his rising and at his setting because his excessive heat scorched and
tormented them."

These statements are based upon moral and psychic facts and not on
physiological disturbance. The story of Atlas (*Vide supra*) gives the
key to it. If the Atlanteans never had their sleep disturbed by dreams,
it is because that particular tradition is concerned with the earliest
Atlanteans, whose physical frame and brain were not yet sufficiently
consolidated, in the physiological sense, to permit the nervous centres
to act during sleep. With regard to that other statement -- namely, that

###### \[\[Footnote(s)\]\] -------------------------------------------------

\* Plato's veracity has been so unwarrantably impeached by even such
friendly critics as Professor Jowett, when the "story of Atlantis" is
discussed, that it seems well to cite the testimony of a specialist on
the subject. It is sufficient to place mere literary cavillers in a very
ridiculous position: --

"If our knowledge of Atlantis was more thorough, it would no doubt
appear that in every instance wherein the people of Europe accord with
the people of America, they were both in accord with the people of
Atlantis. . . . . It will be seen that *in every* *case where Plato
gives us information in this respect as to Atlantis,* *we find this
agreement to exist.* It existed in *architecture, sculpture, navigation,
engraving, writing,* an *established priesthood,* the *mode of worship,
agriculture,* and the *construction of roads and canals*; and it is
reasonable to suppose that the same correspondence extended down to all
the minor details." (Donnelly, "Atlantis," p. 194.)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

###### \[\[Vol. 2, Page\]\] 762 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.

they daily "cursed the Sun" -- this again has nothing to do with the
heat, but with the moral degeneration that grew with the race. It is
explained in our Commentaries. "They (the sixth sub-race of the
Atlanteans) used magic incantations even against the Sun" -- failing in
which, they cursed it. The sorcerers of Thessaly were credited with the
power of calling down the moon, as Greek history assures us. The
Atlanteans of the later period were renowned for their magic powers and
wickedness, their ambition and defiance of the gods. Thence the same
traditions taking form in the Bible about the antediluvian giants and
the Tower of Babel, found also in the "Book of Enoch."

Diodorus records another fact or two: the Atlanteans boasted of
possessing the land in which all the gods had received their birth; as
also of having had Uranus for their first King, he being also the first
to teach them astronomy. Very little more than this has come down to us
from Antiquity.

The myth of Atlas is an allegory easily understood. Atlas is the old
continents of Lemuria and Atlantis, combined and personified in one
symbol. The poets attribute to Atlas, as to Proteus, a superior wisdom
and an universal knowledge, and especially *a thorough acquaintance with
the depths of the ocean*: because both continents bore races instructed
by *divine* masters, and because both were transferred to the bottom of
the seas, where they now slumber until their next reappearance above the
waters. Atlas is the son of an ocean nymph, and his daughter is Calypso
-- "the watery deep," (*See Hesiod*'*s Theogony,* 507-509, *and Odyssey*
1, 51): Atlantis has been submerged beneath the waters of the ocean, and
its progeny is now sleeping its eternal sleep on the ocean floors. The
*Odyssey* makes of him the guardian and the "sustainer" of the huge
pillars that separate the heavens from the earth (1, 52-53)*.* He is
their "supporter." And as both Lemuria, destroyed by submarine fires,
and Atlantis, submerged by the waves, perished in the ocean deeps,\*
Atlas is said to have been compelled to leave the surface of the earth,
and join his brother Iapetos in the depths of Tartarus. Sir Theodore
Martin is right in interpreting this allegory as meaning, Atlas
"standing on the solid floor of the inferior hemisphere of the universe
and thus carrying at the same time the *disc* of the earth and the
celestial vault -- the solid envelope of the superior hemisphere" . . .
(*Memoires de l*'*Academie des*

###### \[\[Footnote(s)\]\] -------------------------------------------------

\* Christians ought not to object to this doctrine of the periodical
destruction of continents by fire and water; for St. Peter speaks of the
earth "standing *out of the water,* and *in the water,* which earth,
being *overflowed, perished,* but *is now reserved unto fire*"; (*See
also the* "*Lives of Alchemystical Philosophers,*" *p.* 4*, London,*
1815)*.*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

###### \[\[Vol. 2, Page\]\]763 THE HEIRLOOM OF ATLANTIS.

*Inscriptions, p.* 176). For Atlas is Atlantis which supports the new
continents and their horizons on its "shoulders."

Decharme, in his *Mythologie de la Grece Antique,* expresses a doubt as
to the correctness of Pierron's translation of the Homeric word
\[\[*echei*\]\] by *sustinet,* as it is not possible to see "how Atlas
can support or bear at once several pillars situated in various
localities." If Atlas were an individual it would be an awkward
translation. But, as he personifies a continent in the west said to
support heaven and earth at once (*AEschylus,* "*Prometheus Vinctus,*"
351, 429, *etc.*) *-- i.e.*, the feet of the giant tread the earth while
his shoulders support the celestial vault, an allusion to the gigantic
peaks of the Lemurian and Atlantean continents -- the epithet
"supporter" becomes very correct. The term "conservator" for the Greek
word \[\[*echei*\]\], which Decharme, following Sir Theodore Martin,
understands as meaning \[\[*phulassei*\]\] and \[\[*epimeleitai*\]\],
does not render the same sense.

The conception was certainly due to the gigantic mountain chain running
along the terrestrial border (or disc). These mountain peaks plunged
their roots into the very bottom of the seas, while they raised their
heads heavenward, their summits being lost in the clouds. The ancient
continents had more mountains than valleys on them. Atlas, and the
Teneriffe Peak, now two of the dwarfed relics of the two lost
continents, were thrice as lofty during the day of Lemuria and twice as
high in that of Atlantis. Thus, the Lybians called Mount Atlas "the
pillar of Heaven," according to Herodotus (*IV*., 184), and Pindar
qualified the later AEtna as "the celestial pillar" (*Pyth.* 1, 20;
*Decharme,* 315). Atlas was an inaccessible island peak in the days of
Lemuria, when the African continent had not yet been raised. It is the
sole Western relic which survives, *independent,* of the continent on
which the Third Race was born, developed and *fell*,\* for Australia is
now part of the Eastern continent. Proud Atlas, according to esoteric
tradition, having sunk one third of its size into the waters, its two
parts remained as an heirloom of Atlantis.

This again was known to the priests of Egypt and to Plato himself, the
solemn oath of secrecy, which extended even to the mysteries of
Neo-Platonism, alone preventing the whole truth from being told.\*\* So

###### \[\[Footnote(s)\]\] -------------------------------------------------

\* This does not mean that Atlas is the locality where it fell, for this
took place in Northern and Central Asia; but that Atlas formed part of
the continent.

\*\* Had not Diocletian burned the esoteric works of the Egyptians in
296, together with their books on alchemy -- "\[\[*peri chumeias kai
chrusou*\]\]"; Caesar 700,000 rolls at Alexandria, and Leo Isaurus
300,000 at Constantinople (*viiith cent.*); and the Mahomedans all they
could lay their sacrilegious hands on -- the world might know to-day
more of Atlantis than it does. For Alchemy had its birth-place in
Atlantis during the Fourth Race, and had only its *renaissance* in
Egypt.

###### \[\[Vol. 2, Page\]\] 764 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.

secret was the knowledge of the last islands of Atlantis, indeed, -- on
account of the superhuman powers possessed by its inhabitants, the last
direct descendants of the gods or divine Kings, as it was thought --
that to divulge its whereabouts and existence was punished by death.
Theopompus says as much in his ever-suspected *Meropis,* when he speaks
of the Phoenicians as being the only navigators in the seas which wash
the Western coast of Africa; and who did it with such mystery that very
often they sunk their own vessels to make the too inquisitive foreigners
lose all trace of them.

There are those Orientalists and historians -- and they form the
majority -- who, while feeling quite unmoved at the rather crude
language of the Bible, and some of the events narrated in it, show great
disgust at the *immorality* in the pantheons of India and Greece.\* We
may be told that before them Euripides, Pindar, and even Plato, express
the same; that they too felt irritated with the tales invented --"those
miserable stories of the poets," as Euripides expresses it (\[\[*haoidon
hoide dustenoi logoi*\]\], *Hercules furens,* 1346*, Dindorf*'*s
Edition*)*.*

But there may have been another reason for this, perhaps. To those who
knew that there was more than one key to theogonic symbolism, it was a
mistake to have expressed it in a language so crude and misleading. For
if the educated and learned philosopher could discern the kernel of
wisdom under the coarse rind of the fruit, and knew that the latter
concealed the greatest laws and truths of psychic and physical nature,
as well as the origin of all things -- not so with the uninitiated
profane. For him the dead letter was *religion*; the interpretation --
sacrilege. And this dead letter could neither edify nor make him more
perfect, seeing that such an example was given him by his gods. But

###### \[\[Footnote(s)\]\] -------------------------------------------------

\* Professor Max Muller's Lectures -- "on the Philosophy of Mythology"
-- are before us. We read his citations of Herakleitos (460 **B.C**.),
declaring that Homer deserved "to be ejected from public assemblies and
flogged;" and of Xenophanes "holding Homer and Hesiod responsible for
the popular superstitions of Greece. . . . " and for ascribing "to the
gods whatever is disgraceful and scandalous among men . . . unlawful
acts, such as theft, adultery, and fraud." Finally the Oxford Professor
quotes from Professor Jowett's translation of Plato, where the latter
tells Adaimantos (Republic) that "the young man (in the State) should
not be told that in committing the worst of crimes, he is far from doing
anything outrageous, and that he may chastise his father (as Zeus did
with Kronos) . . in any manner that he likes, and in this will only be
following the example of the first and greatest of the gods. . . In my
opinion, these stories are *not fit to be repeated.*" To this Dr. Max
Muller observes that "the Greek religion was clearly a national and
*traditional* religion, and, as such, it shared both the advantages and
disadvantages *of this form* *of religious* *belief*"; while the
Christian religion is "an *historical* and, to a great extent, an
individual religion, and it possesses the advantage of an authorised
codex and of a settled system of faith" (p. 349). So much the worse if
it is "historical," for surely Lot's incident with his daughters would
only gain, were it "allegorical."

###### \[\[Vol. 2, Page\]\] 765 THE GOD-BEARING LAND.

to the philosopher -- especially the Initiate -- Hesiod's theogony is as
*historical* as any history can be. Plato accepts it as such, and gives
out as much of its truths as his pledges permitted him.

The fact that the Atlantes claimed Uranos for their first king, and that
Plato commences his story of Atlantis by the division of the great
continent by Neptune, the grandson of Uranos, shows that there were
continents and kings before Atlantis. For Neptune, to whose lot that
continent fell, finds on a small island only one human couple made of
clay (*i.e.*, the first physical *human* man, whose origin began with
the last sub-races of the Third Root-Race). It is their daughter Clito
that the god marries, and it is his eldest son *Atlas* who receives for
his part the mountain and the continent which was called by his name.

Now all the gods of Olympus, as well as those of the Hindu Pantheon and
the Rishis, were the septiform personations (1) of the *noumena* of the
intelligent Powers of nature; (2) of Cosmic Forces; (3) of celestial
bodies; (4) of gods or Dhyan Chohans; (5) of psychic and spiritual
powers; (6) of divine kings on earth (or the incarnations of the gods);
and (7) of terrestrial heroes or men. The knowledge how to discern among
these seven forms the one that is meant, belonged at all times to the
Initiates, whose earliest predecessors had created this symbolical and
allegorical system.

Thus while Uranos (or the host representing this celestial group)
reigned and ruled over the Second Race and their (then) Continent;
Kronos or Saturn governed the Lemurians; and Jupiter, Neptune\* and
others fought in the allegory for Atlantis, which was the whole earth in
the day of the Fourth Race. Poseidonis, or the (last) island of Atlantis
"the third step of Idaspati" (or Vishnu) in the mystic language of the
secret books -- lasted till about 12,000 years ago.\*\* The Atlantes of
Diodorus were right in claiming that it was their country, the region
surrounding Mount Atlas, where "the gods were born" -- *i.e.*,
"incarnated." But it was after their fourth incarnation that they
became, for the first time, human Kings and rulers.

Diodorus speaks of Uranos as the first king of Atlantis, confusing,
either consciously or otherwise, the continents; but, as shown, Plato
indirectly corrects the statement. The first astronomical teacher of men
was Uranos, because he is one of the seven Dhyan Chohans of that second
period or Race. Thus also in the second Manvantara

###### \[\[Footnote(s)\]\] -------------------------------------------------

\* Neptune or Poseidon is the Hindu Idaspati, identical with Narayana
(the mover on the waters) or Vishnu, and like this Hindu god he is shown
crossing the whole horizon *in three* steps. Idaspati means also "the
master of the waters."

\*\* Bailly's assertion that the 9,000 years mentioned by the Egyptian
priests do not represent "solar years" is groundless. Bailly knew
nothing of geology and its calculations; otherwise he would have spoken
differently.

(that of Swarochisha), among the seven sons of the Manu, the presiding
gods or Rishis of that race, we find *Jyotis,\** the teacher of
astronomy (Jyotisha), one of the names of Brahma. And thus also the
Chinese revere *Tien* (or the sky, Ouranos), and name him as their first
teacher of astronomy. Uranos gave birth to the Titans of the Third Race,
and it is they who (personified by Saturn-Kronos) mutilated him. For as
it is the Titans who *fell into generation,* when "creation *by will*
was superseded by physical procreation," they needed Uranos no more.

And here a short digression must be permitted and pardoned. In
consequence of the last scholarly production of Mr. Gladstone in the
*Nineteenth Century,* "The Greater Gods of Olympos," the ideas of the
general public about Greek Mythology have been still further perverted
and biassed. Homer is credited with an inner thought, which is regarded
by Mr. Gladstone as "the true key to the Homeric conception," whereas
this "key" was merely a *blind*. Poseidon "is indeed essentially of the
earth earthy . . . . strong and self-asserting, sensual and intensely
jealous and vindictive," -- but this is because he symbolises the Spirit
of the Fourth Root-Race, the ruler of the Seas, that race which lives
above the surface of the seas (\[\[*limne*\]\], Il. xxiv., 79), which is
composed of the giants, the children of Eurymedon, the race which is the
father of Polyphemus, the Titan and *one-eyed* Cyclops. Though Zeus
reigns over the Fourth Race, it is Poseidon who rules, and who is the
true key to the triad of the Kronid Brothers and to our *human* races.
Poseidon and Nereus *are one*: the former the ruler or spirit of
Atlantis before the beginning of its submersion, the latter, after.
Neptune is the titanic strength of the *living* race; Nereus, its spirit
reincarnated in the subsequent Fifth or Aryan Race: and this is what the
great Greek scholar of England has not yet discovered, or even dimly
perceived. And yet he makes many observations upon the "artfulness" of
Homer, who never names Nereus, at whose designation we arrive . . . .
only through the patronymic of the Nereids!

Thus the tendency of even the most erudite Hellenists is to confine
their speculations to the exoteric images of mythology and to lose sight
of their inner meaning: and it is remarkably illustrated in the case of
the Right Hon. W. E. Gladstone, as we have shown. While almost the most
conspicuous figure of our age as a statesman, he is at the same time one
of the most cultured scholars England has given birth to. Grecian
literature has been the loving study of his life, and he has found time
amid the bustle of public affairs to enrich contemporary literature with
contributions to Greek scholarship which will make his name famous
through coming generations. At the same time, as his sincere

admirer, the present writer cannot but feel a deep regret that
posterity, while acknowledging his profound erudition and splendid
culture, will yet, in the greater light which *must* then shine upon the
whole question of symbolism and mythology, judge that he has failed to
grasp the spirit of the religious system which he has often criticised
from the dogmatic Christian standpoint. In that future day it will be
perceived that the esoteric key to the mysteries of the Christian as
well as of the Grecian theogonies and Sciences, is the *Secret Doctrine*
of the pre-historic nations, which, along with others, he has denied. It
is that Doctrine alone which can trace the kinship of all human
religious speculations or even so-called *Revelations,* and it is this
teaching which infuses the Spirit of life into the lay figures on the
Mounts of Meru, Olympus, Walhalla, or Sinai. If Mr. Gladstone were a
younger man, his admirers might hope that his scholastic studies would
be crowned by the discovery of this underlying truth. As it is, he but
wastes the golden hours of his declining years in futile disputations
with that giant free-thinker, Col. Ingersoll, each fighting with the
weapons of exoteric temper, drawn from the arsenals of *ignorant *
**L**ITERALISM. These two great controversialists are equally blind to
the true esoteric meaning of the texts which they hurl at each other's
head like iron bullets, while the world alone suffers by such
controversies: since the one helps to strengthen the ranks of
materialism, and the other those of blind Sectarianism and of the dead
letter. And now we may return once more to our immediate subject.

Many a time Atlantis is spoken of under another name, one unknown to our
commentators. The *power of names* is great, and was known since the
first men were instructed by the *divine* masters. And as Solon had
studied it, he translated the "Atlantean" names into names devised by
himself. In connection with the continent of Atlantis, it is desirable
to bear in mind that the accounts which have come down to us from the
old Greek writers contain a confusion of statements, some referring to
the Great Continent and others to the last small island of Poseidonis.
It has become customary to take them all as referring to the latter
only, but that this is incorrect is evident from the incompatibility of
the various statements as to the size, etc., of "Atlantis."

Thus, in the Timaeus and Critias, Plato says, that the plain surrounding
the city was itself surrounded by mountain chains. . . . . And the plain
was smooth and level, and of an oblong shape, lying north and south,
three thousand stadia in one direction and two thousand in the other. .
. . . They surrounded the plain by an enormous canal or dike, 101 feet
deep, 606 feet broad, and 1,250 miles in length.

Now in other places the entire size of the *island* of Poseidonis is
given as about the same as that assigned here to the "*plain* around the

------------------------------------------------------------------------

###### \[\[Vol. 2, Page\]\] 768 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.

city" alone. Obviously, one set of statements refers to the great
continent, and the other to its last remnant -- Plato's island.

And, again, the standing army of Atlantis is given as upwards of a
million men; its navy as 1,200 ships and 240,000 men. Such statements
are quite inapplicable to a small island state, of about the size of
Ireland!

The Greek allegories give to Atlas, or Atlantis, seven daughters (seven
sub-races), whose respective names are Maia, Electra, Taygeta, Asterope,
Merope, Alcyone, and Celaeno. This ethnologically, as they are credited
with having married gods and with having become the mothers of famous
heroes, the founders of many nations and cities. Astronomically, the
Atlantides have become the seven Pleiades (?). In occult science the two
are connected with the destinies of nations, those destinies being
shaped by the past events of their early lives according to Karmic law.

Three great nations claimed in antiquity a direct descent from the
kingdom of Saturn or Lemuria (confused already several thousands of
years before our era with Atlantis): and these were the Egyptians, the
Phoenicians (*Vide* Sanchoniathon), and the old Greeks (*Vide* Diodorus,
after Plato). But the oldest civilized country of Asia -- India -- can
be shown to claim the same descent likewise. Sub-races guided by Karmic
law or destiny repeat unconsciously the first steps of their respective
mother-races. As the comparatively fair Brahmins have come -- when
invading India with its dark-coloured Dravidians -- from the North, so
the Aryan Fifth Race must claim its origin from northern regions. The
occult sciences show that the founders (the respective groups of the
seven Prajapatis) of the Root Races have all been connected with the
Pole Star. In the Commentary we find: --

"*He who understands the age of Dhruva\* who measures 9090 mortal years,
will understand the times of the pralayas, the final destiny of nations,
O Lanoo.*"

Moreover there must have been a good reason why an Asiatic nation should
locate its great progenitors and saints in the *Ursa Major,* a *northern
constellation.* It is 70,000 YEARS, HOWEVER, SINCE THE POLE OF THE EARTH
POINTED TO THE FURTHER END OF URSA MINOR'S TAIL; and many more thousand
years since the seven Rishis could have been identified with the
constellation of Ursa Major.

The Aryan race was born and developed in the far north, though after the
sinking of the continent of Atlantis its tribes emigrated further south
into Asia. Hence Prometheus is son of Asia, and Deukalion, his son, the
Greek Noah -- he who created men out of the stones of mother

earth -- is called a northern Scythe, by Lucian, and Prometheus is made
the brother of Atlas and is tied down to Mount Caucasus amid the
Snows.\*

Greece had her *Hyperborean* as well as her *Southern* Apollo. Thus
nearly all the gods of Egypt, Greece, and Phoenicia, as well as those of
other Pantheons, are of a northern origin and originated in Lemuria,
towards the close of the Third Race, after its full physical and
physiological evolution had been completed.\*\* All the "fables" of
Greece were built on historical facts, if that history had only passed
unadulterated by myths to posterity. The "one-eyed" Cyclopes, the giants
fabled as the sons of *Coelus* and *Terra --* three in number, according
to Hesiod -- were the last three sub-races of the Lemurians, the
"one-eye" referring to the Wisdom eye\*\*\*; for the two front eyes were
fully developed as physical organs only in the beginning of the Fourth
Race. The allegory of Ulysses, whose companions were devoured while the
king of Ithaca was saved by putting out with a fire-brand the eye of
Polyphemus, is based upon the psycho-physiological atrophy of the
"third" eye. Ulysses belongs to the cycle of the heroes of the Fourth
Race, and, though a "sage" in the sight of the latter, must have been a
profligate in the opinion of the pastoral Cyclopes.\*\*\*\* His
adventure with the latter -- a savage gigantic race, the antithesis of
cultured civilization in the Odyssey -- is an allegorical record of the
gradual passage from the Cyclopean civilization of stone and colossal
buildings to the more sensual and physical culture of the Atlanteans,
which finally caused the last of

\* Deukalion is said to have brought the worship of Adonis and Osiris
into Phoenicia. Now the worship is that of the Sun, lost and found again
in its astronomical significance. It is only at the Pole where the Sun
dies out for such a length of time as six months, for in latitude 68
\[\[degrees\]\] it remains *dead* only for forty days, as in the
festival of Osiris. The two worships were born in the north of Lemuria,
or on that continent of which Asia was a kind of broken prolongation,
and which stretched up to the Polar regions. This is well shown by de
Gebelin's "*Allegories d*'*Orient,*" p. 246, and by Bailly; though
neither Hercules nor Osiris are *solar myths,* save in one of their
seven aspects.

\*\* The Hyperboreans, now regarded as mythical, were described (*Herod,
IV.,* 33-35; *Pausanias,* 1*,* 31, 2; V., 7, 8; *ad X.,* 5, 7, 8) as the
beloved priests and servants of the gods, and of Apollo chiefly.

\*\*\* The Cyclopes are not the only "one-eyed" representatives in
tradition. The Arimaspes were a Scythian people, and were also credited
with but one eye. (*Geographie ancienne, Vol. II, p.* 321.) It is they
whom Apollo destroyed with his shafts. (*See supra.*)

\*\*\*\* Ulysses was wrecked on the isle of AEaea, where Circe changed
all his companions into pigs for *their voluptuousness*; and after that
he was thrown into Ogygia, the island of Calypso, where for some seven
years he lived with the nymph in illicit connection (*Odyssey and
elsewhere*)*.* Now Calypso was a daughter of *Atlas* (*Odys. Book
XII.*)*,* and all the traditional ancient versions, when speaking of the
Isle of Ogygia, say that it was very distant from Greece, and right in
the middle of the ocean: thus identifying it with Atlantis.

the Third Race to lose their all-penetrating *spiritual* eye. That other
allegory, which makes Apollo kill the Cyclops to avenge the death of his
son Asclepios, does not refer to the three races represented by the
three sons of Heaven and Earth, but to the Hyperborean Arimaspian
Cyclopes, the last of the race endowed with the "Wisdom-eye." The former
have left relics of their buildings everywhere, in the south as much as
in the north; the latter, were confined to the north solely. Thus Apollo
-- pre-eminently the god of the Seers, whose duty it is to punish
desecration -- killed them -- his shafts representing human passions,
fiery and lethal -- and hid his shaft behind a mountain in the
Hyperborean regions. (*Hygin.* "*Astron. Poetique,*" *Book ii. c.*
15)*.* Cosmically and astronomically this Hyperborean god is the Sun
personified, which during the course of the sidereal year (25,868 y.)
changes the climates on the earth's surface, making of tropical, frigid
regions, and *vice versa.* Psychically and spiritually his significance
is far more important. As Mr. Gladstone pertinently remarks in his
"Greater Gods of Olympos," "the qualities of Apollo (jointly with
Athene) are impossible to be accounted for without repairing to sources,
which lie beyond the limit of the traditions most commonly explored for
the elucidation of the Greek mythology" (*Nineteenth Century,* July,
1887.)

The history of Latona (Leto), Apollo's mother, is most pregnant in
various meanings. Astronomically, Latona is the polar region and the
night, giving birth to the Sun, Apollo, Phoebus, etc. She is born in the
Hyperborean countries wherein all the inhabitants were priests of her
son, celebrating his resurrection and descent to their country every
nineteen years at the renewal of the lunar cycle (*Diod. Sic. II.* 307).
Latona is the Hyperborean Continent, and its race -- geologically.\*

\* To make a difference between Lemuria and Atlantis, the ancient
writers referred to the latter as the northern or Hyperborean Atlantis,
and to the former as the southern. Thus Apollodorus says (*Mythology,
Book II.*): "The golden apples carried away by Hercules are not, as some
think, in Lybia; they are in the Hyperborean Atlantis." The Greeks
naturalised all the gods they borrowed and made Hellenes of them, and
the moderns helped them. Thus also the mythologists have tried to make
of Eridan the river Po, in Italy. In the myth of Phaeton it is said that
at his death his sisters dropped hot tears which fell into Eridan and
were changed into amber! Now amber is found only in the northern seas,
in the Baltic. Phaeton, meeting with his death while carrying heat to
the frozen stars of the boreal regions, awakening at the Pole the Dragon
made rigid by cold, and being hurled down into the Eridan, is an
allegory referring directly to the changes of climate in those distant
times when, from a frigid zone, the polar lands had become a country
with a moderate and warm climate. The usurper of the functions of the
sun, Phaeton, being hurled into the Eridan by Jupiter's thunderbolt, is
an allusion to the second change that took place in those regions when,
once more, the land where "the magnolia blossomed" became the desolate
forbidding land of the farthest north and eternal ices. This allegory
covers then the events of two *pralayas*; and if well understood ought
to be a demonstration of the enormous antiquity of the human races.

When the astronomical meaning cedes its place to the spiritual and
divine -- Apollo and Athene transforming themselves into the form of
*birds,* the symbol and glyph of the higher divinities and angels --
then the bright god assumes divine creative powers. Apollo becomes the
personification of Seership, when he sends the astral double of AEneas
to the battle field (**II.** 431-53), and has the gift of appearing to
his Seers without being visible to other persons present -- (Iliad,
xvii., 322-36) -- a gift, however, shared by every high Adept.

The King of the Hyperboreans, was, therefore, the son of Boreas, the
north-wind, and the High Priest of Apollo. The quarrel of Latona with
Niobe (the Atlantean race) -- the mother of seven sons and seven
daughters personifying the seven sub-races of the Fourth Race and their
seven branches (see Apollodorus for this number) -- allegorizes the
history of the two continents. The wrath of "the sons of god," or of
"Will and Yoga," at seeing the steady degradation of the Atlanteans was
great (*See* "*The Sons of God and the Sacred Island*"); and the
destruction of the "children of Niobe" by the children of Latona --
Apollo and Diana, the deities of light, wisdom and purity, or the Sun
and Moon astronomically, whose influence causes changes in the earth's
axis, deluges and other cosmic cataclysms -- is thus very clear.\* The
fable about the

###### \[\[Footnote(s)\]\] -------------------------------------------------

\* So occult and mystic is one of the aspects of Latona that she is made
to reappear even in *Revelation* (*xii.*) as the woman clothed with the
Sun (Apollo) and the Moon (Diana) under her feet, who being with child
"cries, travailing in birth, pained to be delivered." A great red
Dragon, etc., stands before the woman ready to devour the child. She
brings forth the man child who was to rule all nations with a rod of
iron, and who was caught unto the throne of God (the Sun). The woman
fled to the wilderness still pursued by the Dragon, who flees again, and
casts out of his mouth water as a flood, when the earth helped the woman
and swallowed the flood; and the Dragon went to make war with the
remnant of her seed who keep the commandment of God, etc. (*See xii.,*
1, 17.) Anyone, who reads the allegory of Latona pursued by the revenge
of jealous Juno, will recognise the identity of the two versions. Juno
sends Python, the Dragon, to persecute and destroy Latona and devour her
babe. The latter is Apollo, the Sun, for "the man-child, who was to rule
all nations with a rod of iron" of *Revelation,* is surely not the meek
"Son of God," Jesus, but the physical Sun, "who rules all nations"; the
Dragon being the North Pole, gradually chasing the early Lemurians from
the lands which became more and more Hyperborean and unfit to be
inhabited by those who were fast developing into physical men, for they
now had to deal with the climatic variations. The Dragon will not allow
Latona "to bring forth" -- (the Sun to appear). "She is driven from
heaven, and finds no place where she can bring forth," until Neptune
(the ocean), moved with pity, makes immovable the floating isle of Delos
(the nymph Asteria, hitherto hiding from Jupiter under the waves of the
ocean) on which Latona finds refuge and where the bright god
\[\[*Delios*\]\] is born, the god, who no sooner appears than he kills
Python, the cold and frost of the Arctic region, in whose deadly coils
all life becomes extinct. In other words, Latona-Lemuria is transformed
into Niobe-Atlantis, over which her son Apollo, or the Sun, reigns --
with an iron rod, truly, since Herodotus makes the Atlantes *curse* his
too great heat. This allegory is reproduced in its other mystic meaning
(another of the seven keys) in the \[\[Footnote continued on next

never-ceasing tears of Niobe, whose grief causes Zeus to change her into
a fountain -- Atlantis covered with water -- is no less graphic as a
symbol. Niobe, let it be remembered, is the daughter of one of the
Pleiades (or Atlantides) the *grand-daughter* of Atlas therefore, (*See*
"*Metamorphoses of Ovid,*" *Book VI.*)*,* because she represents the
last generations of the doomed continent.

A true remark, that of Bailly, which says that Atlantis had an enormous
influence on antiquity. "If these names," he adds, "are mere allegories,
then all that those fables contain of truth comes from Atlantis; if the
fable is a real tradition -- however altered -- then the whole of the
ancient history is still in it." (*Lettres sur l*'*Atlantide, p.* 137.)

So much so, that all ancient writings -- prose and poetry -- are full of
the reminiscences of the Lemuro-Atlanteans, the first *physical* races,
though the Third and the Fourth in number. Hesiod records the tradition
about the men of the age of Bronze, whom Jupiter had made out of
ash-wood and who had hearts harder than diamond. Clad in bronze from
head to foot they passed their lives in fighting. Monstrous in size,
endowed with a terrible strength, invincible arms and hands descended
from their shoulders, says the poet (*Hesiod, in oper. and dieb. v*.
143). Such were the giants of the first physical races. The Iranians
have a reference to the later Atlanteans in Yasna ix. 15. Tradition
maintains that the "Sons of God," or the great Initiates of the Sacred
Island, took advantage of the Deluge, to rid the earth of all the
Sorcerers among the Atlanteans. The said verse addresses Zoroaster as
one of the "Sons of God." -- It says: "Thou, O Zarathustra, didst make
all demons (*i.e.*, Sorcerers), who before roamed the world in human
forms, conceal themselves in the earth" (*i.e.*, helped them to get
submerged).

The Lemurians, as also the early Atlanteans, were divided into two
distinct classes -- the "Sons of Night" or Darkness, and the "Sons of
the Sun," or Light. The old books tell us of terrible battles between
the two, when the former, leaving their land of Darkness, from whence
the Sun departed for long months, descended from their inhospitable
regions and "tried to wrench the lord of light" from their better
favoured brothers of the equatorial regions. We may be told that the
ancients knew nothing of the long night of six months' duration in the
Polar regions. Even Herodotus, more learned

\[\[Footnote continued from previous page\]\] chapter just cited of the
*Apocalypse.* Latona became a powerful goddess indeed, and saw her son
receive worship (solar worship) in almost every fane of antiquity. In
his occult aspect Apollo is patron of Number 7. He is born on the
seventh of the month, and the swans of Myorica swim seven times around
Delos singing that event; he is given seven chords to his Lyre -- the
seven rays of the sun and the seven forces of nature. But this only in
the astronomical meaning, whereas the above is purely geological.

than the rest, only mentions a people who *slept* for six months in the
year, and remained awake the other half. Yet the Greeks knew well that
there was a country in the north where the year was divided into a day
and night of six months' duration each, for Pliny says so in his Fourth
Book, c. 12. They speak of the Cimmerians and of the Hyperboreans, and
draw a distinction between the two. The former inhabited the *Palus
Maeotis* (between 45 \[\[degrees\]\] and 50 \[\[degrees\]\] latitude).
Plutarch explains that they were *but a small portion of a great nation*
driven away by the Scythians, which nation stopped near Tanais, *having
crossed Asia.* "These warlike multitudes lived formerly on the ocean
shores, in dense forests, and *under a tenebrous sky.* There the pole is
almost touching the head, there *long nights and days divide the year*"
(*in Mario*)*.* As to the Hyperboreans, these peoples, as expressed by
Solinus Polyhistor (*c*. 16), "sow in the morning, reap at noon, gather
their fruits in the evening, and store them during the night in their
caves."

Even the writers of the *Zohar* knew of the fact (as shown in iii., fol.
10*a*), as it is written: "In the Book of Hammannunah, the Old, we learn
. . . . there are some countries of the earth which are lightened,
whilst others are in darkness; these have the day, when for the former
it is night; and *there are countries in which* it is constantly day, or
in which at least the night continues only some instants." (Isaac Myer's
"*Qabbalah,*" p. 139).

The island of *Delos,* the Asteria of the Greek mythology, was never in
Greece, a country which, in its day, was not yet in existence, not even
in its molecular form. Several writers have shown that it represented a
country or an island, far larger than the small dots of land which
became Greece. Both Pliny and Diodorus Siculus place it in the Northern
seas. One calls it *Basilea* or "royal" (*Vol. II., p.* 225 *of Diod.*);
the other, Pliny, names it *Osericta* (*Book xxxvii, c.* 2)*,* a word,
according to Rudbeck (*Vol. I., p.* 462-464), having had "a significance
in the northern languages, equivalent to the Island of the *divine*
Kings or god-Kings," or again the "royal island of the gods," because
the gods were born there, *i.e.*, the divine dynasties of the kings of
Atlantis proceeded from that place. Let geographers and geologists seek
for it among that group of islands discovered by Nordenskiold on his
*Vega* voyage in the arctic regions.\* The secret books inform us that
*the climate has changed in those regions more than once* since the
first men inhabited those now almost inaccessible latitudes. They were a
paradise before they became hell;

###### \[\[Footnote(s)\]\] -------------------------------------------------

\* These islands were "found strewn with fossils of horses, sheep, oxen,
etc., among gigantic bones of elephants, mammoths, rhinoceroses," etc.
If there was no man on earth at that period "how came horses and sheep
to be found in company with the huge antediluvians?" asks a master in a
letter. ("*Esoteric Buddhism,*" 67). The reply is given above in the
text.

the dark Hades of the Greeks and the cold realm of Shades where the
Scandinavian Hel, the goddess-Queen of the country of the dead, "holds
sway deep down in Helheim and Niflheim." Yet, it was the birth-place of
Apollo, who was the brightest of gods, in heaven -- astronomically -- as
he was the most enlightened of the divine kings who ruled over the early
nations, in his human meaning. The latter fact is borne out in the
*Iliad IV.,* 239-62*, Vide* "The Greater gods" -- wherein Apollo is said
to have appeared four times in his own form (as the god of the four
races) and six times in human form, *i.e.*, as connected with the divine
Dynasties of the earlier unseparated Lemurians.

It is those early mysterious peoples, their countries (which have now
become uninhabitable), as well as the name given to man both dead and
alive, which have furnished an opportunity to the ignorant Church
fathers for inventing a hell, which they have transformed into a burning
instead of a freezing locality.\*

It is, of course, evident that it is neither the Hyperboreans, nor the
Cimmerians, the Arimaspes, nor even the Scyths -- known to and
communicating with the Greeks -- who were our Atlanteans. But they were
all the descendants of their last sub-races. The Pelasgians were
certainly one of the root-races of future Greece, and were a remnant of
a sub-race of Atlantis. Plato hints as much in speaking of the latter,
whose name it is averred came from *pelagus,* the great sea. Noah's
Deluge is astronomical and allegorical, but it is not mythical, for the
story is based upon the same archaic tradition of men -- or rather of
nations -- which were saved during the cataclysms, in canoes, arks, and
ships. No one would presume to say that the Chaldean Xisuthrus, the
Hindu Vaivasvata, the Chinese Peirun -- the "beloved of the gods," who
rescued him from the flood in a canoe -- or the Swedish Belgamer, for
whom the gods did the same in the north, are all identical as a
personage. But their legends have all sprung from the catastrophe which
involved both the continent and the island of Atlantis.

The allegory about the antediluvian giants and their achievements in
Sorcery is no myth. Biblical events *are* revealed indeed. But it is
neither by the voice of God amid thunder and lightning on Mount

###### \[\[Footnote(s)\]\] -------------------------------------------------

\* A good proof that all the gods, and religious beliefs, and myths have
come from the north, which was also the cradle of *physical* man, lies
in several suggestive words which have originated and remain to this day
among the northern tribes in their primeval significance; but although
there was a time when all the nations were "of one lip," these words
have received a different meaning with the Greeks and Latins. One such
word is *Mann, Man,* a living being, and *Manes,* dead men. The
Laplanders call their corpses to this day *manee,* (*Voyage de Renard en
Laponie* I., 184). Mannus is the ancestor of the German race; the Hindu
Manu, the thinking being, from man; the Egyptian *Menes*; and *Minos,*
the King of Crete, judge of the infernal regions after his death -- all
proceed from the same root or word.

###### \[\[Vol. 2, Page\]\] 775 WHO WERE THE NEPHILIM?

Sinai, nor by a divine finger tracing the record on tablets of stone,
but simply through tradition *via* pagan sources. It was not surely the
Pentateuch that Diodorus was repeating when he wrote upon the Titans --
the giants born of Heaven and Earth, or, rather, born of the Sons of God
who took to themselves for wives the daughters of men who were fair. Nor
was Pherecydes quoting from Genesis when giving details on those giants
which are not to be found in the Jewish Scriptures. He says that the
Hyperboreans were of the race of the Titans, which race descended from
the earliest giants, and that it was that Hyperborean region which was
the birth-place of the first giants. The Commentaries on the sacred
books explain that the said region was the far north, the polar lands
now, the pre-Lemurian earliest continent, embracing once upon a time the
present Greenland, Spitzbergen, Sweden, Norway, etc.

But who were the *Nephilim* of Genesis vi. 4? There were Palaeolithic
and Neolithic men in Palestine ages before the events recorded in the
book of the Beginnings. The theological tradition identifies these
Nephilim with hairy men or Satyrs, the latter being mythical in the
Fifth Race and the former historical in both the Fourth and Fifth Races.
We have stated elsewhere what the prototypes of these Satyrs were, and
have spoken of the bestiality of the early and later Atlantean race.
What is the meaning of Poseidon's amours under such a variety of
*animal* forms? He became a dolphin to win Amphitrite; a horse, to
seduce Ceres; a ram, to deceive Theophane, etc., etc. Poseidon is not
only the personation of the Spirit and Race of Atlantis, but also of the
vices of these giants. Gesenius and others devote an enormous space to
the meaning of the word *Nephilim* and explain very little. But Esoteric
records show these hairy creatures to be the last descendants of those
Lemuro-Atlantean races, which begot children on female animals, of
species now long extinct; thus producing *dumb* men, "monsters," as the
Stanzas have it.

Now mythology, built upon Hesiod's Theogony, which is but a poetised
record of actual traditions, or oral history, speaks of three giants,
called Briareus, Kottos, and Gyges, living in a dark country where they
were imprisoned by Kronos for their rebellion against him. All the three
are endowed by myth with an hundred arms and fifty heads, the latter
standing for races, the former for sub-races and tribes. Bearing in mind
that in mythology every personage almost is a god or derni-god, and also
a king or simple mortal in his second aspect;\* and

###### \[\[Footnote(s)\]\] -------------------------------------------------

\* Thus, for instance, Gyges is a hundred-armed and fifty-headed
monster, a demi-god in one case, and a Lydian, the successor of
Candaules, king of the country, in another version. The same is found in
the Indian Pantheon, where Rishis and the Sons of Brahma are reborn as
mortals.

###### \[\[Vol. 2, Page\]\] 776 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.

that both stand as symbols for lands, islands, powers of nature,
elements, nations, races and sub-races, the esoteric Commentary will
become comprehensible. It says that the three giants are three polar
lands which have changed form several times, at each new cataclysm, or
disappearance of one continent to make room for another. The whole globe
is convulsed periodically; and has been so convulsed, since the
appearance of the First Race, four times. Yet, though the whole face of
the earth was transformed thereby each time, the conformation of the
arctic and antarctic poles has but little altered. The polar lands unite
and break off from each other into islands and peninsulas, yet remain
ever the same. Therefore northern Asia is called the "eternal or
perpetual land," and the Antarctic the "ever living" and "the
concealed"; while the Mediterranean, Atlantic, Pacific and other regions
disappear and reappear in turn, into and above the great waters.

From the first appearance of the great continent of Lemuria, the three
polar giants had been imprisoned in their circle by Kronos. Their gaol
is surrounded by a wall of bronze, and the exit is through gates
fabricated by Poseidon (or Neptune, hence by the seas), which they
cannot cross; and it is in that damp region, where eternal darkness
reigns, that the three brothers languish. The Iliad (viii., 13) makes of
it the Tartaros. When the gods and Titans rebelled in their turn against
Zeus -- the deity of the Fourth Race -- the father of the gods bethought
himself of the imprisoned giants in order to conquer the gods and
Titans, and to precipitate the latter into Hades; or, in clearer words,
to have Lemuria hurled amid thunder and lightning to the bottom of the
seas, so as to make room for Atlantis, which was to be submerged and
perish in its turn.\* The geological upheaval and deluge of Thessaly was
a repetition on a small scale of the great cataclysm; and, remaining
impressed on the memory of the Greeks, was merged by them into, and
confused with, the general fate of Atlantis. So, also, the war between
the Rakshasas of Lanka and the Bharateans, the melee of the Atlanteans
and Aryans in their supreme struggle, or the conflict between the Devs
and Izeds (or Peris), became, ages later, the struggle of Titans,
separated into two inimical camps, and still later the war between the
angels of God and the angels of Satan. Historical facts became
theological dogmas. Ambitious scholiasts, men of a small sub-race born
but yesterday, and one of the latest issues of the Aryan stock, took
upon themselves to overturn the religious

earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, or by sinking and the great
displacement of waters. Our continents have to perish owing to the
former cataclysmal process. The incessant earthquakes of this and the
past years may be a warning.

thought of the world, and succeeded. For nearly two thousand years they
impressed thinking Humanity with the belief in the existence of Satan.

But as it is now the conviction of more than one Greek scholar -- as it
was that of Bailly and Voltaire -- that Hesiod's theogony was based upon
historical facts (*see Decharme*'*s Mythol. de la Grece Antique*)*,* it
becomes easier for the occult teachings to find their way into the minds
of thoughtful men, and therefore are these passages from mythology
brought forward in our discussion upon modern learning in this
*Addendum.*

Such symbolisms as are found in all the exoteric creeds, are so many
landmarks of prehistoric truths. The sunny, happy land, the primitive
cradle of the earliest human races, has become several times since then
hyperborean and Saturnine\*; thus showing the Golden Age and reign of
Saturn from multiform aspects. It was many-sided in its character indeed
-- climatically, ethnologically and morally. For, the Third, Lemurian
Race must be physiologically divided into the early androgynous and the
later bi-sexual race; and the climate of its dwelling places and
continents into that of an eternal spring and eternal winter, into life
and death, purity and impurity. The Cycle of legends is ever being
transformed on its journey by popular fancy. Yet it may be cleansed from
the dross it has picked up on its way through many nations and through
the countless minds which have added their own exuberant additions to
the original facts. Leaving for a while the Greek interpretations we may
seek for some more corroborations of the latter in the scientific and
geological proofs.

###### \[\[Footnote(s)\]\] -------------------------------------------------

\* Denis, the geographer, tells us that the great sea North of Asia was
called glacial, or *Saturnine* (*v.* 35). Orpheus (*v*. 1077) and Pliny
(*Book IV., c.* 16) corroborate the statement by showing that it is its
giant inhabitants who gave it the name. And the Secret Doctrine explains
both assertions by telling us that all the continents were formed from
North to South; and that as the sudden change of climate dwarfed the
race that had been born on it, arresting its growth, so, several degrees
southward, various conditions had always produced the tallest men in
every new humanity, or race. We see it to this day. The tallest men now
found are those in Northern countries, while the smallest are Southern
Asiatics, Hindus, Chinamen, Japanese, etc. Compare the tall Sikhs and
Punjabees, the Afghans, Norwegians, Russians, Northern Germans,
Scotchmen, and the English, with the inhabitants of central India and
the average European on the continent. Thus also the giants of Atlantis,
and hence the Titans of Hesiod, are all Northerners.
