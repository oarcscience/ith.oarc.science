triple&quot; of Kwan-Shai-Yin because in her correlations, metaphysical
and cosmical, she is the &quot;Mother, the Wife and the Daughter&quot;
of the <EM>Logos</EM>,<EM> </EM>just as in the later theological
translations she became &quot;the Father, Son and (the female)
Holy Ghost&quot; -- the<EM> Sakti </EM>or Energy -- the Essence
of the three. Thus in the Esotericism of the Vedantins, <EM>Daiviprakriti</EM>,
the<EM> </EM>Light manifested through Eswara, the <EM>Logos,**
</EM>is at one and the same time the Mother and also the Daughter
of the Logos or Verbum of Parabrahmam; while in that of the trans-Himalayan
teachings it is -- in the hierarchy of allegorical and metaphysical
theogony -- &quot;the <STRONG>M</STRONG>OTHER&quot; or abstract,
ideal matter, Mulaprakriti, the Root of Nature; -- from the metaphysical
standpoint, a correlation of Adi-Bhuta, manifested in the Logos,
Avalokiteshwara; -- and from the purely occult and

* This stanza is translated from the Chinese text, and the names,
as the equivalents of the original terms, are preserved. The real
esoteric nomenclature cannot be given, as it would only confuse
the reader. The Brahmanical doctrine has no equivalent to these.
Vach seems, in many an aspect, to approach the Chinese Kwan-yin,
but there is no regular worship of Vach under this name in India,
as there is of Kwan-Yin in China. No exoteric religious system
has ever adopted a female Creator, and thus woman was regarded
and treated, from the first dawn of popular religions, as inferior
to man. It is only in China and Egypt that Kwan-Yin and Isis were
placed on a par with the male gods. Esotericism ignores both sexes.
Its highest Deity is sexless as it is formless, neither Father
nor Mother; and its first manifested beings, celestial and terrestrial
alike, become only gradually androgynous and finally separate
into distinct sexes.

<P>
Cosmical, Fohat,* the &quot;Son of the Son,&quot; the androgynous
energy resulting from this &quot;Light of the Logos,&quot; and
which manifests in the plane of the objective Universe as the
hidden, as much as the revealed, Electricity -- which is <STRONG>L</STRONG>IFE.
<P>
(<EM>b</EM>)<EM> Kwan-Yin-Tien </EM>means the &quot;melodious
heaven of Sound,&quot; the abode of Kwan-Yin, or the &quot;<EM>Divine
Voice</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>literally. This &quot;Voice&quot; is
a synonym of the <EM>Verbum </EM>or the Word: &quot;Speech,&quot;
as the expression of thought. Thus may be traced the connection
with, and even the origin of the Hebrew <EM>Bath-Kol</EM>,<EM>
</EM>the &quot;daughter of the Divine Voice,&quot; or <EM>Verbum,
</EM>or the male and female Logos, the &quot;Heavenly Man&quot;
or Adam Kadmon, who is at the same time Sephira. The latter was
surely anticipated by the Hindu Vach, the goddess of Speech, or
of the Word. For Vach -- the daughter and the female portion,
as is stated, of Brahma, one &quot;generated by the gods&quot;
-- is, in company with Kwan-Yin, with Isis (also the <EM>daughter</EM>,
wife and <EM>sister </EM>of Osiris) and other goddesses, the female
<EM>Logos, </EM>so to speak, the goddess of the <EM>active </EM>forces
in Nature, the Word, Voice or Sound, and Speech. If Kwan-Yin is
the &quot;melodious Voice,&quot; so is Vach; &quot;the melodious
cow who milked forth sustenance and water&quot; (the female principle)
-- &quot;who yields us nourishment and sustenance,&quot; as Mother-Nature.
She is associated in the work of creation with the Prajapati.
She is male and female <EM>ad libitum</EM>, as<EM> </EM>Eve is
with Adam. And she is a form of Aditi -- the principle higher
than <EM>Ether</EM> -- in Akasa, the synthesis of all the forces
in Nature; thus Vach and Kwan-Yin are both the magic potency of
Occult sound in Nature and Ether -- which &quot;Voice&quot; calls
forth Sien-Tchan, the illusive form of the Universe out of Chaos
and the Seven Elements.
<P>
Thus in Manu Brahma (the <EM>Logos </EM>also) is shown dividing
his body into two parts, male and female, and creating in the
latter, who is Vach, Viraj, who is himself, or Brahma again --
it is in this way a learned Vedantin Occultist speaks of that
&quot;goddess,&quot; explaining the reason why Eswara (or Brahma)
is called <EM>Verbum </EM>or<EM> Logos</EM>;<EM> </EM>why in fact
it is called Sabda Brahmam: --

<P>
* Says the lecturer on p. 306: &quot;Evolution is commenced by
the intellectual energy of the <EM>Logos</EM>, not merely on account
of the potentialities locked up in <EM>Mulaprakriti. </EM>This
light of the Logos is the link . . . between objective matter
and the subjective thought of <EM>Eswara </EM>(or Logos). It is
called in several Buddhist books <EM>Fohat. </EM>It is the one
instrument with which the <EM>Logos </EM>works.&quot;<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 138 THE SECRET DOCTRINE. </H6>

<P>
&quot;The explanation I am going to give you will appear thoroughly
mystical; but if mystical, it has a tremendous significance when
properly understood. Our old writers said that <EM>Vach </EM>is
of four kinds (see Rig Veda and the Upanishads). <EM>Vaikhari-Vach
</EM>is what we utter. Every kind of <EM>Vaikhari-Vach </EM>exists
in its <EM>Madhyama</EM>,<EM> </EM>further in its <EM>Pasyanti</EM>,<EM>
</EM>and ultimately in its <EM>Para </EM>form.* The reason why
this Pranava is called Vach is this, that the four principles
of the great Kosmos correspond to these four forms of <EM>Vach.
</EM>Now the whole manifested solar System exists in its <EM>Sukshma
</EM>form in the light or energy of the <EM>Logos</EM>, because
its energy is caught up and transferred to Cosmic matter. . .
. The whole Kosmos in its objective form is <EM>Vaikhari-Vach</EM>,
the light of the <EM>Logos </EM>is the <EM>Madhyama </EM>form,
and the Logos itself the <EM>Pasyanti </EM>form, and Parabrahm
the <EM>Para </EM>form or aspect of that Vach. It is by the light
of this explanation that we must try to understand certain statements
made by various philosophers to the effect that the manifested
Kosmos is the <EM>Verbum </EM>manifested as Kosmos&quot; (see
Lecture on the Bhagavadgita, referred to above).

<P>
(<EM>a.</EM>) The seven <EM>Layu </EM>centres are the seven Zero
points, using the term Zero in the same sense that Chemists do,
to indicate a point at which, in Esotericism, the scale of reckoning
of differentiation begins. From the Centres -- beyond which Esoteric
philosophy allows us to perceive the dim metaphysical outlines
of the &quot;Seven Sons&quot; of Life and Light, the Seven Logoi
of the Hermetic and all other philosophers -- begins

<P>
the differentiation of the elements which enter into the constitution
of our Solar System. It has often been asked what was the exact
definition of Fohat and his powers and functions, as he seems
to exercise those of a Personal God as understood in the popular
religions. The answer has just been given in the comment on Stanza
V. As well said in the Bhagavadgita Lectures, &quot;The whole
Kosmos must necessarily exist in the One Source of energy from
which this light (<EM>Fohat</EM>)<EM> </EM>emanates.&quot; Whether
we count the principles in Kosmos and man as seven or only as
four, the forces of, and in, physical Nature are Seven; and it
is stated by the same authority that &quot;<EM>Pragna</EM>,<EM>
</EM>or the capacity of perception, exists in seven different
aspects corresponding to the seven conditions of matter&quot;
(<EM>Personal and impersonal God</EM>)<EM>. </EM>For, &quot;just
as a human being is composed of seven principles, differentiated
matter in the Solar System exists in seven different conditions&quot;
(<EM>ibid</EM>)<EM>. </EM>So does Fohat.* He is One and Seven,
and on the Cosmic plane is behind all such manifestations as light,
heat, sound, adhesion, etc., etc., and is the &quot;spirit&quot;
of <STRONG>E</STRONG>LECTRICITY, which is the <STRONG>L</STRONG>IFE
of the Universe. As an abstraction, we call it the <STRONG>O</STRONG>NE
<STRONG>L</STRONG>IFE; as an objective and evident Reality, we
speak of a septenary scale of manifestation, which begins at the
upper rung with the One Unknowable <STRONG>C</STRONG>AUSALITY,
and ends as Omnipresent Mind and Life immanent in every atom of
Matter. Thus, while science speaks of its evolution through brute
matter, blind force, and senseless motion, the Occultists point
to <EM>intelligent </EM><STRONG>L</STRONG>AW and <EM>sentient
</EM><STRONG>L</STRONG>IFE, and add that Fohat is the guiding
Spirit of all this. Yet he is no personal god at all, but the
emanation of those other Powers behind him whom the Christians
call the &quot;Messengers&quot; of their God (who is in reality
only the Elohim, or rather one of the Seven Creators called Elohim),
and we, the &quot;Messenger of the primordial Sons of Life and
Light.&quot;
<P>
(<EM>b.</EM>)<EM> </EM>The &quot;Elementary Germs&quot; with which
he fills Sien-Tchan (the &quot;Universe&quot;) from Tien-Sin (the
&quot;Heaven of Mind,&quot; literally, or that which is absolute)
are the Atoms of Science and the Monads of Leibnitz.

* &quot;Fohat&quot; has several meanings. (See Stanza V., Commentary

our Septenary chain. <HR>

GIVING BIRTH TO THE OTHER (<EM>b</EM>).
<P>
(<EM>a.</EM>) Although these Stanzas refer to the whole Universe
after a Mahapralaya (universal destruction), yet this sentence,
as any student of Occultism may see, refers also by analogy to
the evolution and final formation of the primitive (though compound)
Seven Elements on our Earth. Of these, four elements are now fully
manifested, while the fifth -- Ether -- is only partially so,
as we are hardly in the second half of the Fourth Round, and consequently
the fifth Element will manifest fully only in the Fifth Round.
The Worlds, including our own, were of course, as germs, primarily
evolved from the ONE Element in its second stage (&quot;Father-Mother,&quot;
the differentiated World's Soul, not what is termed the &quot;Over-Soul&quot;
by Emerson), whether we call it, with modern Science, Cosmic dust
and Fire Mist, or with Occultism -- Akasa, Jivatma, divine Astral
Light, or the &quot;Soul of the World.&quot; But this first stage
of Evolution was in due course of time followed by the next. No
world, as no heavenly body, could be constructed on the objective
plane, had not the Elements been sufficiently differentiated already
from their primeval <EM>Ilus</EM>, resting in <EM>Laya. </EM>The
latter term is a synonym of Nirvana. It is, in fact, the Nirvanic
dissociation of all substances, merged after a life-cycle into
the latency of their primary conditions. It is the luminous but
bodiless shadow of the matter <EM>that was</EM>,<EM> </EM>the
realm of negativeness -- wherein lie latent during their period
of rest the active Forces of the Universe. Now, speaking of Elements,
it is made the standing reproach of the Ancients, that they &quot;supposed
their Elements simple and undecomposable.&quot;* Once more this
is an unwarrantable state-
<H6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
</H6>

<P>
* The shades of our pre-historical ancestors might return the
compliment to modern physicists, now that new discoveries in chemistry
have led Mr. Crookes, <STRONG>F.R.S</STRONG>., to admit that Science
is yet a thousand leagues from the knowledge of the compound nature
of the simplest molecule. From him we learn that such a thing
as a really simple [[Footnote continued on next page]] <HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 141 WERE THE ANCIENTS IGNORANT OF THE PHYSICAL
SCIENCES?</H6>

<P>
ment; as, at any rate, their initiated philosophers can hardly
come under such an imputation, since it is they who have invented
allegories and religious myths from the beginning. Had they been
ignorant of the Heterogeneity of their Elements they would have
had no personifications of Fire, Air, Water, Earth, and AEther;
their Cosmic gods and goddesses would never have been blessed
with such posterity, with so many sons and daughters, elements
born <EM>from </EM>and<EM> within each respective Element</EM>.
Alchemy and occult phenomena would have been a delusion and a
snare, even in theory, had the Ancients been ignorant of the potentialities
and correlative functions and attributes of every element that
enters into the composition of Air, Water, Earth, and even <EM>Fire</EM>
--<EM> </EM>the latter a terra incognita to this day to modern
Science, which is obliged to call it Motion, evolution of light
and heat, state of ignition, -- defining it by its outward aspects
in short, and remaining ignorant of its nature. But that which
<H6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
</H6>

<P>
[[Footnote continued from previous page]] molecule entirely homogeneous
is <EM>terra incognita </EM>in chemistry. &quot;Where are we to
draw the line?&quot; he asks; &quot;is there no way out of this
perplexity? Must we either make the elementary examinations so
stiff that only 60 or 70 candidates can pass, or must we open
the examination doors so wide that the number of admissions is
limited only by the number of applicants?&quot; And then the learned
gentleman gives striking instances. He says: &quot;Take the case
of yttrium. It has its definite atomic weight, it behaved in every
respect as a simple body, an element, to which we might indeed
add, but from which we could not take away. Yet this yttrium,
this supposed homogeneous whole, on being submitted to a certain
method of fractionation, is resolved into portions not absolutely
identical among themselves, and exhibiting a gradation of properties.
Or take the case of didymium. Here was a body betraying all the
recognised characters of an element. It had been separated with
much difficulty from other bodies which approximated closely to
it in their properties, and during this crucial process it had
undergone very severe treatment and very close scrutiny. But then
came another chemist, who, treating this assumed homogeneous body
by a peculiar process of fractionation, resolved it into the two
bodies praseodymium and neodymium, between which certain distinctions
are perceptible. Further, we even now have no certainty that neodymium
and praseodymium are simple bodies. On the contrary, they likewise
exhibit symptoms of splitting up. Now, if one supposed element
on proper treatment is thus found to comprise dissimilar molecules,
we are surely warranted in asking whether similar results might
not be obtained in other elements, perhaps in all elements, if
treated in the right way. We may even ask where the process of
sorting-out is to stop -- a process which of course pre-supposes
variations between the individual molecules of each species. And
in these successive separations we naturally find bodies approaching
more and more closely to each other.&quot; (Presidential address
before the Royal Society of Chemists, March, 1888.)<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 142 THE SECRET DOCTRINE. </H6>

<P>
modern Science seems to fail to perceive is that, differentiated
as may have been those simple chemical atoms -- which archaic
philosophy called &quot;the creators of their respective Parents,&quot;
fathers, brothers, husbands of their mothers, and those mothers
the daughters of their own sons, like Aditi and Daksha, for example
-- differentiated as these elements were in the beginning, still,
they were not the compound bodies known to science, as they are
now. Neither Water, Air, Earth (synonym for solids generally)
existed in their present form, representing the three states of
matter alone recognised by Science; for all these are the productions
already recombined by the atmospheres of globes completely formed
-- even to fire -- so that in the first periods of the earth's
formation they were something quite <EM>sui generis. </EM>Now
that the conditions and laws ruling our solar system are fully
developed; and that the atmosphere of our earth, as of every other
globe, has become, so to say, a crucible of its own, Occult Science
teaches that there is a perpetual exchange taking place in space
of molecules, or of atoms rather, correlating, and thus changing
their combining equivalents on every planet. Some men of Science,
and those among the greatest physicists and chemists, begin to
suspect this fact, which has been known for ages to the Occultists.
The spectroscope only shows the probable similarity (on external
evidence) of terrestrial and sidereal substance; it is unable
to go any farther, or to show whether atoms gravitate towards
one another in the same way and under the same conditions as they
are supposed to do on our planet, physically and chemically. The
scale of temperature, from the highest degree to the lowest that
can be conceived of, may be imagined to be one and the same in
and for the whole Universe; nevertheless, its properties, other
than those of dissociation and reassociation, differ on every
planet; and thus atoms enter into new forms of existence, undreamt
of, and incognizable to, physical Science. As already expressed
in &quot;Five Years of Theosophy,&quot; the essence of Cometary
matter, for instance, &quot;is totally different from any of the
chemical or physical characteristics with which the greatest chemists
and physicists of the earth are acquainted&quot; (p. 242). And
even that matter, during rapid passage through our atmosphere,
undergoes a certain change in its nature. Thus not alone the elements
of our planets, but even those of all its sisters in the Solar
System, differ as widely from each other in their combinations,
as from the Cosmic elements beyond our<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 143 THE SLEEP OF THE ETERNAL MOTHER.</H6>

<P>
Solar limits.* Therefore, they cannot be taken as a standard for
comparison with the same in other worlds.** Enshrined in their
virgin, pristine state within the bosom of the Eternal Mother,
every atom born beyond the threshold of her realm is doomed to
incessant differentiation. &quot;The Mother sleeps, yet is ever
breathing.&quot; And every breath sends out into the plane of
manifestation her Protean products, which, carried on by the wave
of the efflux, are scattered by Fohat, and driven toward and beyond
this or another planetary atmosphere. Once caught by the latter,
the atom is lost; its pristine purity is gone for ever, unless
Fate dissociates it by leading it to &quot;a current of EFFLUX&quot;
(an occult term meaning quite a different process from that which
the ordinary term implies); when it may be carried once more to
the borderland where it had perished, and taking its flight, not
into Space <EM>above </EM>but into Space <EM>within</EM>,<EM>
</EM>it will be brought under a state of differential equilibrium
and happily re-absorbed. Were a truly learned Occultist-alchemist
to write the &quot;Life and Adventures of an Atom&quot; he would
secure thereby the eternal scorn of the modern chemist, perchance
also his subsequent
<H6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
</H6>

<P>
* This is again corroborated by the same man of science in the
same lecture, who quotes Clerk Maxwell, saying &quot;that the
elements are not absolutely homogeneous.&quot; He writes: &quot;It
is difficult to conceive of selection and elimination of intermediate
varieties, for where can these eliminated molecules have gone
to, if, as we have reason to believe, the hydrogen, &amp;c. of
the fixed stars is composed of molecules identical in all respects
with our own.&quot; And he adds: &quot;In the first place we may
call in question this absolute molecular identity, since we have
hitherto had no means for coming to a conclusion save the means
furnished by the spectroscope, while it is admitted that, for
accurately comparing and discriminating the spectra of two bodies,
they should be examined under identical states of temperature,
pressure, and all other physical conditions. We have certainly
seen, in the spectrum of the sun, rays which we have not been
able to identify.&quot;
<P>
** &quot;Each world has its Fohat, who is omnipresent in his own
sphere of action. But there are as many Fohats as there are worlds,
each varying in power and degree of manifestations. The individual
Fohats make one Universal, Collective Fohat -- the aspect-Entity
of the one absolute Non-Entity, which is absolute Be-Ness, 'SAT.'
&quot;Millions and billions of worlds are produced at every Manvantara&quot;
-- it is said. Therefore there must be many Fohats, whom we consider
as conscious and <EM>intelligent </EM>Forces. This, no doubt,
to the disgust of scientific minds. Nevertheless the Occultists,
who have good reasons for it, consider all the forces of Nature
as veritable, though supersensuous, states of Matter; and as possible
objects of perception to Beings endowed with the requisite senses.

Rudra from Brahma &quot;from the brain of the Father and the bosom

a male and a female, <EM>i.e.</EM>, polarity, into positive and

contact</EM> -- whether an embrace or a fight. To avoid this,
he binds together and unites those of unlike nature and separates
those of similar temperaments. This, of course, relates, as any
one can see, to electricity generated by friction and to the law
involving attraction between two objects of unlike, and repulsion
between those of like polarity. The Seven &quot;Sons-brothers,&quot;
however, represent and personify the seven forms of Cosmic magnetism
called in <EM>practical Occultism </EM>the &quot;Seven Radicals,&quot;
whose co-operative and active progeny are, among other energies,
Electricity, Magnetism, Sound, Light, Heat, Cohesion, etc. Occult
Science defines all these as Super-sensuous effects in their hidden
behaviour, and as objective phenomena in the world of senses;
the former requiring abnormal faculties to perceive them -- the
latter, our ordinary physical senses. They all pertain to, and
are the emanations of, still more supersensuous spiritual qualities,
not personated by, but belonging to, real and conscious CAUSES.
To attempt a description of such ENTITIES would be worse than
useless. The reader must bear in mind that, according to our teaching
which regards this phenomenal Universe as a great <EM>Illusion</EM>,<EM>
</EM>the nearer a body is to the <STRONG>U</STRONG>NKNOWN <STRONG>S</STRONG>UBSTANCE,
the more it approaches <EM>reality</EM>,<EM> </EM>as being removed
the farther<HR>

<P>
from this world of <EM>Maya. </EM>Therefore, though the molecular
constitution of their bodies is not deducible from their manifestations
on this plane of consciousness, they nevertheless (from the standpoint
of the adept Occultist) possess a distinctive objective if not
material structure, in the relatively noumenal -- as opposed to
the phenomenal -- Universe. Men of science may term them Force
or Forces generated by matter, or &quot;modes of its motion,&quot;
if they will; Occultism sees in the effects &quot;Elemental&quot;
(forces), and, in the direct causes producing them, intelligent
<STRONG>D</STRONG>IVINE Workmen. The intimate connection of those
Elementals (guided by the unerring hand of the Rulers) -- their
correlation we might call it -- with the elements of pure Matter,
results in our terrestrial phenomena, such as light, heat, magnetism,
etc., etc. Of course we shall never agree with the American Substantialists*
who call every Force and Energy -- whether Light, Heat, Electricity
or Cohesion -- an &quot;Entity&quot;; for this would be equivalent
to calling the noise produced by the rolling of the wheels of
a vehicle an <EM>Entity</EM> --<EM> </EM>thus confusing and identifying
that &quot;noise&quot; with the driver <EM>outside</EM>, and the
guiding Master Intelligence <I>within </I>the vehicle. But we
certainly give that name to the &quot;drivers&quot; and to these
guiding Intelligences -- the ruling Dhyan Chohans, as shown. The
&quot;Elementals,&quot; the Nature-Forces, are the acting, though
invisible, or rather imperceptible, secondary Causes and in themselves
the effects of primary Causes behind the Veil of all terrestrial
phenomena. Electricity, light, heat, etc., have been aptly termed
the &quot;Ghost or Shadow of Matter in Motion,&quot; <EM>i.e.</EM>,
supersensuous states of matter whose effects only we are able
to cognize. To expand, then, the simile given above. The sensation
of light is like the sound of the rolling wheels -- a purely phenomenal
effect, having no existence outside the observer; the proximate
exciting cause of the sensation is comparable to the driver --
a supersensuous state of matter in motion, a Nature-Force or Elemental.
But, behind even this, stand -- just as the owner of the carriage
directs the driver from within -- the higher and <EM>noumenal
</EM>causes, the <EM>Intelligences </EM>from whose essence radiate
these States of &quot;<EM>Mother</EM>,&quot;<EM> </EM>generating
the countless milliards of Elementals or psychic Nature-Spirits,
just as every drop of water generates its physical

from one planet to the other, from one star to another -- child-star.
When a planet dies, its informing principles are transferred to
a <EM>laya </EM>or sleeping centre, with potential but latent
energy in it, which is thus awakened into life and begins to form
itself into a new sidereal body. (<EM>Vide infra</EM>,<EM> </EM>&quot;A
Few Theosophical Misconceptions, etc.&quot;)
<P>
It is most remarkable that, while honestly confessing their entire
ignorance of the true Nature of even terrestrial matter -- primordial
substance being regarded more as a dream than as a sober reality
-- the physicists should set themselves up as judges, nevertheless,
of that matter, and claim to know what it is able and is not able
to do, in various combinations. Scientists know it (matter) hardly
skin-deep, and yet they will dogmatise. It is &quot;a mode of
motion&quot; and nothing else. But the <EM>force </EM>that is
inherent in a living person's breath, when blowing a speck of
dust from the table, is also, and undeniably, &quot;a mode of
motion&quot;; and it is as undeniably not a quality of the matter,
or the particles of that speck, and it emanates from the living
and thinking Entity that breathed, whether the impulse originated
consciously or unconsciously. Indeed, to endow matter -- something
of which nothing is known so far -- with an inherent quality called
Force, of the nature of which still less is known, is to create
a far more serious difficulty than that which lies in the acceptation
of the intervention of our &quot;Nature-Spirits&quot; in every
natural phenomenon.
<P>
The Occultists, who do not say -- if they would express themselves
correctly -- that <EM>matter</EM>, but only the <EM>substance
</EM>or<EM> essence </EM>of matter, is indestructible and eternal,
(<EM>i.e.</EM>, the Root of all, <EM>Mulaprakriti</EM>)<EM>: </EM>assert
that all the so-called Forces of Nature, Electricity, Magnetism,
Light, Heat, etc., etc., far from being modes of motion of material
particles, are <EM>in esse</EM>,<EM> i.e.</EM>,<EM> </EM>in their
ultimate constitution, the differentiated aspects of that Universal
Motion which is discussed and explained in the first pages of
this volume (<EM>See Proem</EM>)<EM>. </EM>When Fohat is said
to produce &quot;Seven Laya Centres,&quot; it means that for formative
or creative purposes, the <STRONG>G</STRONG>REAT <STRONG>L</STRONG>AW
(Theists may call it God) stops, or rather modifies its perpetual
motion on seven invisible points within the area of the manifested
Universe. &quot;<EM>The great Breath digs through Space seven
holes into Laya to cause them to circumgyrate during Manvantara</EM>&quot;<EM>
</EM>(Occult Catechism). We<HR>

<P>
have said that Laya is what Science may call the Zero-point or
line; the realm of absolute negativeness, or the one real absolute
Force, the NOUMENON of the Seventh State of that which we ignorantly
call and recognise as &quot;Force&quot;; or again the Noumenon
of Undifferentiated Cosmic Substance which is itself an unreachable
and unknowable object to finite perception; the root and basis
of all states of objectivity and subjectivity too; the neutral
axis, not one of the many aspects, but its centre. It may serve
to elucidate the meaning if we attempt to imagine a neutral centre
-- the dream of those who would discover perpetual motion. A &quot;neutral
centre&quot; is, in one aspect, the limiting point of any given
set of senses. Thus, imagine two consecutive planes of matter
as already formed; each of these corresponding to an appropriate
set of perceptive organs. We are forced to admit that between
these two planes of matter an incessant circulation takes place;
and if we follow the atoms and molecules of (say) the lower in
their transformation upwards, these will come to a point where
they pass altogether beyond the range of the faculties we are
using on the lower plane. In fact, to us the matter of the lower
plane there vanishes from our perception into nothing -- or rather
it passes on to the higher plane, and the state of matter corresponding
to such a point of transition must certainly possess special and
not readily discoverable properties. Such &quot;Seven Neutral
Centres,&quot;* then, are produced by Fohat, who, when, as Milton
has it --

quickens matter into activity and evolution.
<P>
The<EM> Primordial Atom </EM>(<EM>anu</EM>)<EM> </EM>cannot be
multiplied either in its pregenetic state, or its primogeneity;
therefore it is called &quot;SUM TOTAL,&quot; figuratively, of
course, as that &quot;SUM TOTAL&quot; is boundless. (See Addendum
to this Book.) That which is the abyss of nothingness to the physicist,
who knows only the world of visible causes and effects, is the
boundless Space of the Divine <EM>Plenum </EM>to the Occultist.
Among many other objections to the doctrine of an endless evolution
and re-involution (or re-absorption) of the Kosmos, a process
which, according to the Brahminical and Esoteric Doctrine, is
without a beginning or an end, the Occultist is told that it cannot
be, since &quot;by all the admissions of

modern scientific philosophy it is a necessity of Nature to run
down.&quot; If the tendency of Nature &quot;to run down&quot;
is to be considered so forcible an objection to Occult Cosmogony,
&quot;How,&quot; we may ask, &quot;do your Positivists and Free-thinkers
and Scientists account for the phalanx around us of active stellar
systems?&quot; They had eternity to &quot;run down&quot; in; why,
then, is not the Kosmos a huge inert mass? Even the moon is only
hypothetically believed to be a dead planet, &quot;run down,&quot;
and astronomy does not seem to be acquainted with many such dead
planets.* The query is unanswerable. But apart from this it must
be noted that the idea of the amount of &quot;transformable energy&quot;
in our little system coming to an end is based purely on the fallacious
conception of a &quot;white-hot, incandescent Sun&quot; perpetually
radiating away his heat without compensation into Space. To this
we reply that nature runs down and disappears from the objective
plane, only to re-emerge after a time of rest out of the subjective
and to reascend once more. Our Kosmos and Nature will run down
only to reappear on a more perfect plane after every <STRONG>P</STRONG>RALAYA.
The <EM>matter </EM>of the Eastern philosophers is not the &quot;matter&quot;
and Nature of the Western metaphysicians. For what is Matter?
And above all, what is our scientific philosophy but that which
was so justly and so politely defined by Kant as &quot;the Science
of the <EM>limits </EM>to our Knowledge&quot;? Where have the
many attempts made by Science to bind, to connect, and define
all the phenomena of organic life by mere physical and chemical
manifestations, brought it to? To speculation generally -- mere
soap-bubbles, that burst one after the other before the men of
Science were permitted to discover real facts. All this would
have been avoided, and the progress of knowledge would have proceeded
with gigantic strides, had only Science and its philosophy abstained
from accepting hypotheses on the mere one-sided Knowledge of <I>their</I>
Matter.**

of our Solar System out of the nebulous rings, put [[Footnote

<P>
If no physical intellect is capable of counting the grains of
sand covering a few miles of sea-shore; or to fathom the ultimate
nature and essence of those grains, palpable and visible on the
palm of the naturalist, how can any materialist limit the laws
changing the conditions and being of the atoms in primordial chaos,
or know anything certain about the capabilities and potency of
their atoms and molecules before and after their formation into
worlds? These changeless and eternal molecules -- far thicker
in space than the grains on the ocean shore -- may differ in their
constitution along the line of their planes of existence, as the
soul-substance differs from its vehicle, the body. Each atom has
seven planes of being or existence, we are taught; and each plane
is governed by its specific laws of evolution and absorption.
Ignorant of any, even approximate, chronological data from which
to start in attempting to decide the age of our planet or the
origin of the solar system, astronomers, geologists, and physicists
are drifting with each new hypothesis farther and farther away
from the shores of fact into the fathomless depths of speculative
ontology.* The Law of Analogy in the plan of structure between
the trans-Solar systems and the intra-Solar planets, does not
necessarily bear upon the finite conditions to which every visible
body is subject, in this our plane of being. In Occult Science
this law is the first and most important key to Cosmic physics;
but it has to be studied in its minutest details and, &quot;to
be

[[Footnote continued from previous page]] forward by Kant and
Laplace, was chiefly based on the above fact that all the planets
revolved in the same direction. It is on this fact, mathematically
demonstrated during the time of Laplace, that this great astronomer,
calculating on the theory of probabilities, offered to bet three
milliards to one that the next planet discovered would have in
its system the same peculiarity of motion Eastward. The immutable
laws of scientific mathematics got &quot;worsted by further experiments
and observations,&quot; it was said. This idea of Laplace's mistake
prevails generally to this day; but some astronomers have finally
succeeded in demonstrating (?) that the mistake had been in accepting
Laplace's assertion for a mistake; and steps to correct it without
attracting general attention to the bevue are now being taken.
Many such unpleasant surprises are in store for hypotheses of
even a purely physical character. What further disillusions, then,
may there not be in questions of a transcendental, Occult Nature?
At any rate, Occultism teaches that the so-called &quot;reverse
rotation&quot; is a fact.

* The Occultists, having most perfect faith in their own exact
records, astronomical and mathematical, calculate the age of Humanity,
and assert that the latter (as separate sexes) has existed in

and even some Hindu calendars declare.<HR>

turned seven times,&quot; before one comes to understand it. Occult
philosophy is the only science that can teach it. How, then, can
anyone hang the truth or the untruth of the Occultist's proposition
that &quot;the Kosmos is eternal in its unconditioned collectivity,
and finite but in its conditioned manifestations&quot; on this
one-sided physical enunciation that &quot;it is a necessity of
Nature to run down?&quot;

With these verses -- the 4th Sloka of Stanza VI. -- ends that
portion of the Stanzas which relates to the Universal Cosmogony
after the last Mahapralaya or Universal destruction, which, when
it comes, sweeps out of Space every differentiated thing, Gods
as atoms, like so many dry leaves. From this verse onwards, the
Stanzas are concerned only with our Solar System in general, with
the planetary chains therein, inferentially, and with the history
of our globe (the 4th and its chain) especially. All the Stanzas
and verses which follow in this Book I. refer only to the evolution
of, and on, our Earth. With regard to the latter, a strange tenet
-- strange from the modern scientific stand-point only, of course
-- is held, which ought to be made known.
<P>
But before entirely new and rather startling theories are presented
to the reader, they must be prefaced by a few words of explanation.
This is absolutely necessary, as these theories clash not only
with modern science, but contradict, on certain points, earlier
statements made by other Theosophists, who claim to base their
explanations and renderings of these teachings on the same authority
as we do.*
<P>
This may give rise to the idea that there is a decided contradiction
between the expounders of the same doctrine; whereas the difference,
in reality, arises from the incompleteness of the information
given to earlier writers, who thus drew some erroneous conclusions
and indulged in premature speculations, in their endeavour to
present a complete system to the public. Thus the reader, who
is already a student of Theosophy, must not be surprised to find
in these pages the rectification of certain statements made in
various Theosophical works, and also the explanation of certain
points which have remained obscure, because they were necessarily
left incomplete. Many are the questions upon which even the author
of &quot;Esoteric Buddhism&quot; (the best and

<P>
most accurate of all such works) has not touched. On the other
hand, even he has introduced several mistaken notions which must
now be presented in their true mystic light, as far as the present
writer is capable of doing so.
<P>
Let us then make a short break between the Slokas just explained
and those which follow, for the Cosmic periods which separate
them are of immense duration. This will afford us ample time to
take a bird's eye view of some points pertaining to the Secret
Doctrine, which have been presented to the public under a more
or less uncertain and sometimes mistaken light.
