43\. **T**HEY (*the Lemurians*) BUILT HUGE CITIES. **O**F RARE EARTHS
AND METALS THEY BUILT. **O**UT OF THE FIRES (*lava*) VOMITED. **O**UT OF
THE WHITE STONE OF THE MOUNTAINS (*marble*) AND THE BLACK STONE (*of the
subterranean fires*) THEY CUT THEIR OWN IMAGES, IN THEIR SIZE AND
LIKENESS, AND WORSHIPPED THEM (*a*).

(*a*) As the History of the first two human races -- the last of the
Lemurians and the first of the future Atlanteans -- proceeds, we have at
this point to blend the two, and speak of them for a time collectively.

Here reference is also made to the *divine* Dynasties, such as were
claimed by the Egyptians, Chaldeans, Greeks, etc., to have preceded
their *human* kings; they are still believed in by the modern Hindus,
and are enumerated in their sacred books. But of these we shall treat in
their proper place. What remains to be shown is, that our modern
geologists are now being driven into admitting the evident existence of
submerged continents. But to confess their presence is not to accept
that there were men on them during the early geological periods;\* --

###### \[\[Footnote(s)\]\] -------------------------------------------------

\* This is the reason why, perhaps, even Easter Island with its wondrous
gigantic statues -- a speaking witness to a submerged continent with a
civilized mankind on it -- is hardly mentioned anywhere in the modern
Encyclopaedias. Its mention is carefully avoided except in some books of
Travels; modem science has an undeniable predilection for forcing upon
the cultured public hypotheses, built on personal hobbies, as
well-established evidence, for offering it *guesses* instead of
Knowledge, and calling them "scientific conclusions." Its specialists
will evolve a thousand and one contradictory speculations rather than
confess an *awkward self-evident fact -*- pre-eminent among such
specialists being Haeckel and his English admirers and co-thinkers. Yet
"they are authorities" -- we are sternly reminded. What of that? The
Pope of Rome is also an AUTHORITY and an infallible one -- for *his*
followers; whereas the remarkable fallibility of Scientific speculations
is being proven periodically with every change of the moon.

ay, men and civilized nations, not Palaeolithic savages only; who, under
the guidance of their divine Rulers, built large cities, cultivated arts
and sciences, and knew astronomy, architecture and mathematics to
perfection. This primeval civilization did not, as one may think,
immediately follow their physiological transformation. Between the final
evolution and the first city built, many hundred thousands of years had
passed. Yet, we find the Lemurians in their sixth sub-race building
their first rock-cities out of stone and lava.\* One of such great
cities of primitive structure was built entirely of lava, some thirty
miles west from where Easter Island now stretches its narrow piece of
sterile ground, and was entirely destroyed by a series of volcanic
eruptions. The oldest remains of Cyclopean buildings were all the
handiwork of the Lemurians of the last sub-races; and an occultist
shows, therefore, no wonder on learning that the stone relics found on
the small piece of land called Easter Island by Captain Cook, are "very
much like the walls of the Temple of Pachacamac or the Ruins of
Tia-Huanuco in Peru," ("The Countries of the World," by Robert Brown,
Vol. 4, p. 43); and that they are in the **C**YCLOPEAN STYLE. The first
large cities, however, appeared on that region of the continent which is
now known as the island of Madagascar. There were civilized people and
savages in

\[\[Footnote(s)\]\] -------------------------------------------------

\* Our best modern novelists, who are neither Theosophists nor
Spiritualists, begin to have, nevertheless, very psychological and
suggestively Occult dreams: witness Mr. Louis Stephenson and his Dr.
Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, than which no grander psychological essay on Occult
lines exists. Has the rising novelist, Mr. Rider Haggard, also had a
prophetic or rather a retrospective clairvoyant dream before he wrote
"**S**HE"? His imperial Kor, the great city of the dead, whose surviving
living men sailed northwards after the plague had killed almost a whole
nation, seems to step out in its general outlines from the imperishable
pages of the old archaic records. Ayesha suggests "that those men who
sailed north may have been the fathers of the first Egyptians"; and then
seems to attempt a synopsis of certain letters of a **M**ASTER quoted in
"Esoteric Buddhism." For, she says, "Time after time have nations, ay,
and rich and strong nations, learned in the arts, been, and passed away,
and been forgotten, so that no memory of them remains. This (the nation
of Kor) is but one of several; for time eats up the work of man unless,
indeed, he digs in caves like the people of Kor, and *then mayhap the
sea swallows* t*hem, or the earthquake shakes them* *in*. . . . . Yet
were not these people utterly destroyed, as I think. Some few remained
in the other cities, for their cities were many. But the barbarians . .
. came down upon them, and took their women to wife, and the race of the
Amahagger that is now is a bastard brood of the mighty sons of Kor, and
behold it dwelleth in the tombs with its fathers' bones. . ." (*pp.*
180, 181.)

Here the clever novelist seems to repeat the history of all the now
degraded and down-fallen races of humanity. The Geologists and
Anthropologists would place at the head of humanity as descendants of
*Homo primigenius,* the ape-man, of which "NO FOSSIL REMAINS ARE AS YET
KNOWN TO US," but (which) "were PROBABLY akin to *the gorilla* and
*orang of the present day*" (*Haeckel*)*.* In answer to whose
"probably," occultists point to another and a greater *probability --*
the one given in our text. (*See above.*)

those days as there are now. Evolution achieved its work of perfection
with the former, and Karma -- its work of destruction on the latter. The
Australians and their like are the descendants of those, who, instead of
vivifying the spark dropped into them by the "Flames," extinguished it
by long generations of bestiality.\* The Aryan nations could trace their
descent through the Atlanteans from the more spiritual races of the
Lemurians, in whom the "Sons of Wisdom" had personally incarnated.\*\*

It is with the advent of the divine Dynasties that the first
civilizations were started. And while, in some regions of the Earth, a
portion of mankind preferred leading a nomadic and patriarchal life, and
in others savage man was hardly learning to build a fire and to protect
himself against the Elements, his brothers -- more favoured than he by
their *Karma,* and helped by the divine intelligence which informed them
-- built cities, and cultivated arts and sciences. Nevertheless, and
civilization notwithstand-

###### \[\[Footnote(s)\]\] -------------------------------------------------

\* See Stanza II, *ante.* This would account for the great difference
and variation between the intellectual capacities of races, nations, and
individual men. While incarnating, and in other cases only informing the
human vehicles evolved by the first brainless (*manasless*) race, the
incarnating Powers and Principles had to make their choice between, and
take into account, the past Karmas of the *Monads,* between which and
their bodies they had to become the connecting link. Besides which, as
correctly stated in "*Esoteric Buddhism*" (*p.* 30), "the fifth
principle, or human (intellectual) soul, in the majority of mankind is
not even yet fully developed."

\*\* It is said by Krishna, the *Logos* incarnate, in the
*Bhagavat-gita,* "The seven great Rishis, the four preceding Manus,
partaking of my nature, were born from my mind: from them sprang
(emanated or was born) the human race and the world," (*Chap. X. Verse
6.*)

Here, by the seven great Rishis, the seven great *rupa* hierarchies or
classes of Dhyan Chohans, are meant. Let us bear in mind that the
*Saptarshi* (the seven Rishis) are the regents of the seven stars of the
Great Bear, therefore, of the same nature as the angels of the planets,
or the seven great Planetary Spirits. They were all reborn, all men on
earth in various Kalpas and races. Moreover, "the four preceding Manus"
are the four classes of the originally *arupa* gods -- the Kumaras, the
Rudras, the Asuras, etc.: who are also said *to have incarnated.* They
are not the Prajapatis, as the first are, but their informing principles
-- some of which have incarnated in men, while others have made other
men simply the vehicles of their reflections. As Krishna truly says
--the same words being repeated later by another *vehicle* of the
**L**OGOS -- "I am the same to all beings. . . . those who worship me
(the 6th principle or the intellectual *divine* Soul, *Buddhi,* made
conscious by its union with the higher faculties of *Manas*) *are in me,
and I am* *in them.*" (*Ibid,* 29.) The Logos, being no personality but
the universal principle, is represented by all the divine Powers *born
of its mind -*- the pure Flames, or, as they are called in Occultism,
the "Intellectual Breaths" -- those angels who are said to *have made
themselves independent, i.e.,* passed from the passive and quiescent,
into the active state of Self-Consciousness. When this is recognised,
the true meaning of Krishna becomes comprehensible. But see Mr. Subba
Row's excellent lecture on the *Bhagavatgita,* ("*Theosophist,*" *April*
1887, *p*. 444.)

ing, while their pastoral brethren enjoyed wondrous powers as their
birthright, they, the builders, could now obtain theirs only gradually;
even these being generally used for power over physical nature and
selfish and unholy purposes. Civilization has ever developed the
physical and the intellectual at the cost of the psychic and spiritual.
The command and the guidance over his own psychic nature, which foolish
men now associate with the supernatural, were with early Humanity innate
and congenital, and came to man as naturally as walking and thinking.
"There is no such thing as magic" philosophises "**S**HE," the author
forgetting that "magic" in her early day still meant the great SCIENCE
of WIDOM, and that Ayesha could not possibly know anything of the modern
perversion of thought -- "though there is such a thing as knowledge of
the Secrets of Nature." (p. 152). But they have become "Secrets" only in
our race, and were public property with the Third.

Gradually, mankind went down in stature, for, even before the real
advent of the Fourth or Atlantean race, the majority of mankind had
fallen into iniquity and sin, save the hierarchy of the "Elect," the
followers and disciples of the "Sons of Will and Yoga" -- called later
the "Sons of the Fire Mist."

Then came the Atlanteans; the giants whose physical beauty and strength
reached their climax, in accordance with evolutionary law, toward the
middle period of their fourth sub-race. But, as said in the Commentary:
--

*The last survivors of the fair child of the White Island* (the
primitive Sveta-dwipa) *had perished ages before. Their* (Lemuria's)
*elect, had taken shelter on the sacred Island* (now the "fabled"
Shamballah, in the Gobi Desert), *while some of their accursed races,
separating from the main stock, now lived in the jungles and
underground* ("cave-men"), *when the golden yellow race* (the Fourth)
*became in its turn* "*black with sin.*" *From pole to pole the Earth
had changed her face for the third time, and was no longer inhabited by
the Sons of Sveta-dwipa, the blessed, and Adbhitanya, east and west, the
first, the one and the pure, had become corrupted*. . . . *The demi-gods
of the Third had made room for the semi-demons of the Fourth Race.
Sveta-dwipa, whose northern parts of the Toyambudhi the seven Kumaras*
(*Sanaka, Sananda, Sanatana, Sanatkumara, Jata, Vodhu, and Panchasikha*)
*had visited, agreeably with exoteric tradition* (See the Uttara Khanda
of the Padma Purana; Asiat. Researches also, Vol. **XI**., pp. 99, 100);
*the White Island had veiled her face. Her children now lived on the
Black land, wherein, later on, Daityas from the seventh Dwipa*
(*Pushkara*) *and Rakshasas from the seventh*

###### \[\[Vol. 2, Page\]\] 320 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.

*climate replaced the Saddhus and the ascetics of the Third age, who*
"*had descended to them from other and higher regions.*" . . . .

It is evident that, taken in their dead letter, the Puranas read as an
absurd tissue of fairy tales and no better. But if one reads chapters
**I.**, **II**. and **III**. from Book II. (Vol. II.) of Vishnu Purana
and accepts *verbatim* its geography, geodesy, and ethnology, in the
matter of Priyavrata's seven sons, among whom the father divides the
seven *Dwipas* (Continental Islands); and then proceeds to study how the
eldest son, the King of *Jambu-dwipa,* Agnidhra, apportioned Jambu-dwipa
among his nine sons; and then how Nabhi *his* son, who had a *hundred
sons* and apportioned all these in his turn -- then the reader is likely
to throw the book away and pronounce it a farrago of nonsense. But the
esoteric student will understand that, in the days when the Puranas were
written, the true meaning was clear only to the Initiated Brahmins, who
wrote those works allegorically and would not give the *whole* truth to
the masses. And he will explain to the Orientalists who, beginning with
Colonel Wilford and ending with Professor Weber, made and still are
making such a mess of it, that the first three chapters (*See Wilson*'*s
trans. of Vishnu Purana Book II et seq.*) purposely confuse the
following subjects and events: --

I. The series of Kalpas or Ages (also of Races) are never taken into
account; *e.g*., events which have happened in one being allowed to
stand along with those which took place in another. The chronological
order is entirely ignored. This is shown by several of the Sanskrit
commentators, who explain the incompatibility of events and calculations
in saying -- "Whenever any contradictions in different Puranas are
observed, they are ascribed . . . to differences of Kalpas and the
*like*" (*Vishnu and Bhagavata Puranas*).

II\. The several meanings of the words "Manvantara" and "Kalpa" or age,
are withheld, and the general one only given.

III\. In the genealogy and geography of the Kings and their *Varshas*
(countries) and Dwipas, they are all allowed to be regarded as
terrestrial regions.

Now, the truth is that, without entering into too minute details, it is
easy and permissible to show that: --

(*a*) The Seven *Dwipas* apportioned to Priyavrata's septenary progeny
refer to several localities: first of all to our planetary chain.
*Jambu-dwipa* alone representing our globe, the six others are the (to
us) invisible companion globes of this earth. This is shown by the very
nature of the allegorical and symbolic descriptions. *Jambu* (dwipa)
"*is in the centre of all these* (the so-called insular continents) and
is surrounded" by a *sea of salt water* (lavana), whereas Plaksha,
Salmalia,

------------------------------------------------------------------------

###### \[\[Vol. 2, Page\]\] 321 THE HINDU SYMBOLIZATION.

Kusa, Krauncha, Saka and Pushkara, are "surrounded severally -- by great
seas of sugar-cane juice, of wine, of clarified butter, of curds, of
milk," etc., etc., and such like metaphorical names. (*Chap. II, Book
II*) This is shown furthermore by --

(*b*) Bhaskara Acharya, who uses expressions from the *Secret Doctrine*
and its books, in his description of the sidereal position of all these
dwipas: -- "the sea of milk and the sea of curds" etc., meaning the
Milky Way, and the various congeries of nebulae; the more so, since he
names "the country to the south of the equator *Bhur-loka,* that to the
north *Bhuva-loka, Swar, Mahar, Jana, Tapo* and *Satya lokas*"; *and*
says: "Those lokas are gradually attained by increasing religious
merits," *i.e.*, they are various *paradises.* (*See Bibliotheca Indica.
Trans. of the Goladhyaya of the Siddhanta-siromani III.,* 21-44).

(*c*) That this geographical division of seven allegorical continents,
islands, mountains, seas and countries, does not belong only to *our*
Round nor even to *our* races (the name of Bharata Varsha (India)
notwithstanding), is explained in the texts themselves by the narrator
of *Vishnu Purana.* For he closes the first chapter by saying: "Bharata
(the son of *Nabhi,* who gave his name to Bharata-Varsha or India)
consigned the Kingdom to his son Sumati . . . . and abandoned his life
at Salagrama. He was afterwards born again as a religious Brahman, in a
distinguished family of ascetics . . . . under these princes (Bharata's
descendants) Bharata Varsha was divided into nine portions, and their
descendants held successively possession of the country for seventy-one
periods of the aggregate of the four ages," or the reign of a Manu,
representing a Mahayuga of 4,320,000 years.

But having said so much, Parasara suddenly explains that "this was the
creation of Swayambhuva Manu, by which the earth was peopled *when he
presided over the first Manvantara,* in the Kalpa of Varaha," *i.e*.,
the *boar* incarnation, or *Avatar.* Now every Brahmin knows that *it is
only with Vaivasvata Manu* that *our* Humanity began on this Earth (or
*Round*)*.* And if the Western reader turns to the sub-section on "*The
Primeval Manus of Humanity,*" he will see that Vaivasvata is the
*seventh* of the fourteen Manus who preside over our planetary chain
during its life cycle: *i.e.*, that representing or standing in every
Round for two Manus of the same name (a *Root* and a *Seed* Manu), he is
the Root Manu of the Fourth Round, hence the seventh. Wilson finds in
this only "an incongruity" (see his *Vishnu Purana,* vol. II., p. 108,
footnote), and speculates that "the patriarchial genealogies are older
than the chronological system of Manvantaras and Kalpas," and thus "have
been rather clumsily distributed amongst the different periods." It is
nothing of the kind.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

###### \[\[Vol. 2, Page\]\] 322 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.

But as Orientalists know nothing of the secret teaching, they will take
everything *literally,* and then turn round and abuse the writers of
that which they do not comprehend!

These genealogies embrace a period of *three and a half Rounds*; *they*
speak of *pre-human* periods, and explain the descent into generation of
every Manu -- the first manifested sparks of the **O**NE Unity -- and
show, furthermore, each of these human sparks dividing into, and
multiplying by, first, the *Pitars,* the human ancestors, then by human
Races. No being can become God, or Deva, unless he passes through the
human cycles. Therefore the Sloka says, "Happy are those who are born,
even from the (latent) condition of gods, *as men,* in Bharata-varsha;
as that is the way to . . . final liberation." In Jambu-dwipa, Bharata
is considered *the best of its divisions,* because IT IS THE LAND OF
WORKS. In it alone "it is that the succession of four Yugas (ages), the
Krita, the Treta, the Dwapara, and Kali take place"; when, therefore,
Parasara, asked by Maitreya "to give him the descriptions of the Earth,"
returns again to the enumeration of the same Dwipas with the same seas,
etc., as those he had described in the Swayambhuva Manvantara -- it is
simply a *blind,* yet, to him who reads between the lines, the Four
great Races and the Fifth are there, ay, with their sub-divisions,
islands, and continents, some of which were called by the names of
celestial lokas, and by those of other globes. Hence the confusion.

All these are called by the Orientalists "mythical" and "fabulous"
islands and lands.\* Very true, some *are not of this earth,* but they
still exist. The "White Island" and *Atala,* at all events, are no
myths, since the latter was the name contemptuously applied by the
earliest pioneers of the Fifth Race to the land of Sin -- Atlantis, in
general, not to Plato's island alone; and since the former was (*a*) the
Sveta-dwipa of theogony, and (*b*) Saka-dwipa, or Atlantis (its earliest
portions) in its beginnings. This was when it yet had its "seven holy
rivers that washed away all sin," and its "seven districts, wherein
there was no dereliction of virtue, no contention, no deviation from
virtue," as it was then inhabited by the caste of the *Magas -- that*
caste which even the Brahmins acknowledged as not inferior to their own
-- and which was

###### \[\[Footnote(s)\]\] -------------------------------------------------

\* In a lecture, Professor Pengelly, **F.R.S**., quoting Professor
Oliver, makes him say "that the present Atlantic islands' Flora affords
no substantial evidence of a former direct communication with the
mainland of the New World," but himself adds that, at the same time, "at
some period of the Tertiary epoch, N. E. Asia was united to N. W.
America, perhaps by the line where the Aleutian chain of islands now
extends." Thus Occult Science alone can reconcile the contradictions and
hesitations of modern Science. Moreover, surely the argument for the
existence of Atlantis does not rest on Botany alone.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

###### \[\[Vol. 2, Page\]\] 323 THE MAGIS IN THE DAYS OF KRISHNA.

the nursery of the first Zaratushta. The Brahmins are shown consulting
with Gauramukha, on Narada's advice, who told them to invite the *Magas*
as priests of the Sun in the temple built by Samba (the reputed) son of
Krishna, who in reality had none. In this the Puranas are *historical
--*allegory notwithstanding -- and Occultism is stating facts.

The whole story is told in Bhavishya Purana. It is stated that, having
been cured by Surya (the Sun) of leprosy, Samba, having built a temple
dedicated to the Sun, was looking for pious Brahmins to perform the
appointed rites in it, and receive donations made to the God. But Narada
(this virgin ascetic whom one finds in every age in the Puranas) advised
him not to do so, as Manu forbade the Brahmins to receive emoluments for
the performance of religious rites. He therefore referred Samba to
Gauramukha (white face), the *Purohita* or family priest of Hgrasena,
King of Mathura, who would tell him whom he could best employ. The
priest directed Samba to invite the *Magas,* the worshippers of Surya,
to discharge the duty. Ignorant of the place they lived in, it is Surya,
the Sun himself, who directs Samba to Sakadwipa *beyond the salt water.*
Then Samba performs the journey, using Garuda (Vishnu's and Krishna's
vehicle, the great Bird) who lands him among the Magas, etc.

Now Krishna, who lived 5,000 years ago, and Narada, who is found reborn
in every cycle (or race), besides Garuda -- the symbol esoterically of
the great cycle -- show the allegory; yet the Magas are the Magi of
Chaldea, and their class and worship were born on the earlier Atlantis,
in Saka-dwipa, the Sinless. All the Orientalists are agreed that the
Magas of Saka-dwipa are the forefathers of the fire-worshipping Parsis.
Our quarrel with them rests, as usual, on their dwarfing hundreds of
thousands to a few centuries this time: they carry the event -- Narada
and Samba notwithstanding -- to the days of the flight of the Parsis to
Gujerat, which is simply absurd, as that was in the **VIII**th cent. of
our era. Though the Magas in the Bhavishya Purana are credited with
still living in Saka-dwipa in the day of Krishna's Son, yet the last of
it -- Plato's "Atlantis" -- had perished 6000 years before. They were
Mag "late of" Saka-Dwipa, and lived in those days in Chaldea. This is an
intentional confusion, again.

The earliest pioneers of the Fourth Race were not Atlanteans, nor yet
the human *Asuras* and the *Rakshasas* which they became later. In those
days large portions of the future continent of Atlantis were yet part
and parcel of the Ocean floors. "Lemuria," as we have called the
continent of the Third Race, was then a gigantic land.\* It covered

name of Lemuria nor even Atlantis are the real *archaic* names of the
lost continents, but have been adopted by us for the sake of clearness.

the whole area of space from the foot of the Himalayas, which separated
it from the inland sea rolling its waves over what is now Tibet,
Mongolia, and the great desert of Schamo (Gobi); from Chittagong,
westward to Hardwar, and eastward to Assam. From thence, it stretched
South across what is known to us as Southern India, Ceylon, and Sumatra;
then embracing on its way, as we go South, Madagascar on its right hand
and Australia and Tasmania on its left, it ran down to within a few
degrees of the Antarctic Circle; when, from Australia, an inland region
on the Mother Continent in those ages, it extended far into the Pacific
Ocean, not only beyond Rapa-nui (Teapy, or Easter Island) which now lies
in latitude 26 S., and longitude 110 W. (*See Addenda to this Book II.,
Section,* "*Proofs of the Submerged Continents.*") This statement seems
corroborated by Science, -- even if only partially; as, when discussing
continental trends, and showing the infra-Arctic masses trending
generally with the Meridian, several ancient continents are generally
mentioned, though inferentially. Among such the "Mascarene continent,"
which included Madagascar, stretching north and south, is spoken of, and
the existence of another *ancient* continent running "from Spitzbergen
to the Straits of Dover, while most of the other parts of Europe were
sea bottom," is taught.\* The latter corroborates, then, the Occult
teaching which shows the (now) polar regions as the earliest of the
seven cradles of Humanity, and as the tomb of the bulk of the mankind of
that region during the Third Race, when the gigantic continent of
Lemuria began separating into smaller continents. This is due, according
to the explanation in the Commentary, to a decrease of velocity in the
earth's rotation: --

"*When the Wheel runs at the usual rate, its extremities* (the poles)
*agree with its middle circle* (equator), *when it runs slower and tilts
in every direction, there is a great disturbance on the face of the
Earth. The* *waters flow toward*

###### \[\[Footnote(s)\]\] -------------------------------------------------

\[\[Footnote continued from previous page\]\] portions of the submerged
Fourth-Race continent which were "beyond the pillars of Hercules," and
which happened to keep above water after the general cataclysm. The last
remnant of these -- Plato's *Atlantis,* or the "Poseidon" (another
*substitute* or rather a translation of the real name) -- was the last
of it some 11,000 years ago. Most of the correct names of the countries
and islands of both continents are given in the Puranas; but to mention
them specially, as found in other more ancient works, such as the *Surya
Siddhanta,* would necessitate too lengthy explanations. If, in earlier
writings, the two seem to have been too faintly disconnected, this must
be due to careless reading and want of reflection. If ages hence,
Europeans are referred to as Aryans, and a reader confuses them with the
Hindus and the latter with the Fourth Race, as they live (some of them)
in ancient Lanka -- the blame will not fall on the writer.

\* See Professor Dana's article, "*American Journal of Science,*"
**III**, v. 442-3; Prof. Winchell's "*World Life*"; and other geological
works.

*the two ends, and new lands arise in the middle belt* (equatorial
lands), *while those at the ends are subject to pralayas by submersion*
. . . ."

And again: --

. . . "*Thus the wheel* (the Earth) *is subject to, and regulated by,
the Spirit of the Moon, for the breath of its waters* (tides). *Toward
the close of the age* (Kalpa) *of a great* (root) *race, the regents of
the moon* (the Pitar fathers, or Pitris) *begin drawing harder, and thus
flatten the wheel about its belt, when it goes down in some places and
swells in others, and the swelling running toward the extremities*
(poles) *new lands will arise and old ones be sucked in.*"

We have but to read astronomical and geological works, to see the
meaning of the above very clearly. Scientists (*modern* Specialists)
have ascertained the influence of the tides on the geological
distribution of land and water on the planets, and the shifting of the
oceans with a corresponding subsidence and rise of continents and new
lands. Science knows, or thinks it knows, that this occurs
periodically.\* Professor Todd believes he can trace the series of
oscillations backward to the periods of the earth's first incrustation.
(*See* "*American Naturalist,*" *XVIII.,* 15 *et seq.*); therefore it
seems easy for Science to verify the Esoteric statements. We propose to
treat of this at greater length in the *Addenda.* (*Vide* § § V. and
VI.)

It is asked by some Theosophists: "What will Atlantis be like when
raised?" they understanding from a few words in "*Esoteric Buddhism*"
that "old continents" that have been submerged will reappear. Here,
again, there is a slight misconception. Were the *same* identical lands
of Atlantis that were submerged to be raised again, then they would,
indeed, be *barren for ages.* Because the Atlantic sea-bottom is covered
with some 5,000 feet of chalk at present, and more is forming -- a new
"cretaceous formation" of strata, in fact -- is no reason why, when the
time for a new continent to appear arrives, a geological convulsion and
upraising of the sea bottom should not dispose of these 5,000 feet of
chalk for the formation of some mountains and 5,000 more come to the
surface. The racial cataclysms are not a Noah's deluge of forty days --
a kind of Bombay monsoon.

\* Speaking on periodical elevation and subsidence of the equatorial and
polar regions, and ensuing changes of climate, Mr. Winchell (professor
of Geology at Michigan) says -- "As the movements here contemplated are
cyclical, the same conditions would recur again and again; and
accordingly the same fauna might return again and again to the same
region, with intervals of occupation by another fauna. Progressive
sedimentation would preserve the records of such faunal alterations; and
there would be presented the phenomena of 'colonies' 're-apparitions'
and other faunal dislocations in the vertical and horizontal
distributions of fossil remains. These phenomena are well known to the
student of geology." ("*Effects of Astronomical Changes*.")

That the periodical sinking and re-appearance of the mighty continents,
now called Atlantis and Lemuria by the modern writers, is no fiction,
will be demonstrated in the Section in which all the proofs of the same
have been collated together. The most archaic Sanskrit and Tamil works
teem with references to both Continents. The seven sacred Islands
(Dwipas) are mentioned in the *Surya Siddhanta,* the oldest astronomical
work in the whole world, and in the works of Asura Maya, the Atlantean
astronomer whom Professor Weber has made out re-incarnated in Ptolemy.
Yet, it is a mistake to call these "sacred islands" *Atlantean --* as
done by us; for, like everything else in the Hindu Sacred Books, they
are made to refer to several things. The heirloom left by Priyavrata,
the Son of Swayambhuva Manu, to his seven sons -- was not *Atlantis,*
even though one or two of these islands survived the subsidence of their
fellows, and offered shelter, ages later, to Atlanteans, whose continent
had been submerged in its turn. When originally mentioned by Parasara
(*Vishnu Purana*) the seven refer to an esoteric doctrine which is
explained further on. Of all the seven islands, Jambu-dwipa is the only
one that is terrestrial, for *it is our globe.* In the Puranas every
reference to the North of Meru is connected with that primeval Eldorado,
now the North Polar region; which, when the magnolia blossomed there
where now we see an unexplored endless desert of ice, was then a
continent again. Science speaks of an ancient continent which stretched
from Spitzbergen down to the Straits of Dover. The Secret Doctrine
teaches that, in the earliest geological periods, these regions formed a
horse-shoe-like continent, whose one end, the Eastern, far more
northward than North Cornwall, included Greenland, and the other
contained Behring Straits as an inland piece of ground, and descended
southward in its natural trend down to the British Isles, which in those
days must have been right under the lower curve of the semi-circle. This
continent was raised simultaneously with the submersion of the
equatorial portions of Lemuria. Ages later, some of the Lemurian remains
re-appeared again on the face of the Oceans. Therefore, though it can be
said without departing from truth that Atlantis is included in the Seven
great insular continents, since the Fourth Race Atlanteans got some of
the Lemurian relics, and, settling on the islands, included them among
*their* lands and continents, yet a difference should be made and an
explanation given, once that a fuller and more accurate account is
attempted, as in the present work. Easter Island was also taken
possession of in this manner by some Atlanteans; who, having escaped
from the cataclysm which befell their own land, settled on that remnant
of Lemuria only to perish thereon, when destroyed in one day by its
volcanic fires and lava. This may be regarded as fiction by certain
geographers and geologists; to the Occul-

tists it is *history.* What does Science know to the contrary? "Until
the appearance of a map, published at Basle in 1522, wherein the name of
America appears for the first time, *the latter was believed to be part
of India* . . . . . Science also refuses to sanction the *wild*
hypothesis that there was a time when the Indian peninsula at one end of
the line, and South America at the other, were connected by a belt of
islands and continents. The India of the pre-historic ages . . . . was
doubly connected with the two Americas. The lands of the ancestors of
those whom Ammianus Marcellinus calls the 'Brahmans of Upper India'
stretched from Kashmir far into the (now) deserts of Schamo. A
pedestrian from the north might then have reached -- hardly wetting his
feet -- the Alaskan peninsula, through Manchooria, across the *future*
Gulf of Tartary, the Kurile and Aleutian islands; while another
traveller, furnished with a canoe, and starting from the South, could
have walked over from Siam, crossed the Polynesian Islands and trudged
into any part of the continent of South America." (*But see* "*Five
years of Theosophy,*" *art.* "*Leaflets from Esoteric History,*" *pp.*
338 *and* 340.) This was written from the words of a **M**ASTER -- a
rather doubtful authority for the materialists and the sceptics. But
here we have one of their own flock, and a bird of the same feather --
Ernest Haeckel, who, in *his* distribution of races, corroborates the
statement almost *verbatim: .* . . . "It would seem that the region on
the earth's surface where the evolution of these primitive men from the
CLOSELY RELATED CATARRHINE APES (! !) took place, must be sought either
in Southern Asia or Eastern Africa \[which, by the bye, was not even in
existence when the Third Race flourished -- *H.P.B.\]* or in Lemuria.
Lemuria is an ancient continent now sunk beneath the waters of the
Indian Ocean, which, lying to the South of the Asia of to-day, stretched
on the one hand eastwards to upper India and Sunda Island, on the other
westward as far as Madagascar and Africa." (*See supra and compare*
"*The Pedigree of Man,*" *p.* 80-81.)

In the epoch we are treating of, the Continent of "Lemuria," had already
broken asunder in many places, and formed new separate continents. There
was, nevertheless, neither Africa nor the Americas, still less Europe in
those days, all these slumbering yet on the Ocean floors. Nor was there
much of present Asia; for the cis-Himalayan regions were covered with
seas, and beyond this stretched the "lotus leaves" of *Sveta-dwipa,* the
countries now called Greenland, Eastern and Western Siberia, etc., etc.
The immense Continent, which had once reigned supreme over the Indian,
Atlantic, and Pacific Oceans, now consisted of huge islands which were
gradually disappearing one after the other, until the final convulsion
engulfed the last remains of it. Easter Isle, for instance, belongs to
the earliest civilisation of the Third

Race. Submerged with the rest, a volcanic and sudden uplifting of the
Ocean floor, raised the small relic of the Archaic ages untouched, with
its volcano and statues, during the Champlain epoch of northern polar
submersion, as a standing witness to the existence of Lemuria. It is
said that some of the Australian tribes are the last remnants of the
last descendants of the Third Race.

In this we are again corroborated to a degree by materialistic Science.
Haeckel, when speaking of Blumenbach's brown or Malay race and the
Australians and Papuans, remarks: -- "There is much likeness between
these last and the Aborigines of Polynesia, that Australian
island-world, that *seems to have been once on a time a gigantic and
continuous continent.*" ("*Pedigree of Man,*" *p. 82. But see footnote
supra and the Addenda.*)

It certainly was, since it stretched, during the Third Race, east and
west, as far as where the two Americas now lie, and since the present
Australia is but a portion of it, as are also a few surviving islands
sown hither and thither on the face of the Pacific and a large bit of
California, which belonged to it. Funnily enough, Haeckel, in his
fantastic "Pedigree of Man," considers "the Australians of to-day as the
lineal descendants, almost unchanged (? !), of that *second* branch of
the primitive human race. . . that spread northwards, at first chiefly
in Asia, from the home of man's infancy, and seems to have been the
parent of all the other straight-haired races of men. . . . The one,
woolly-haired, migrated in part, westwards" . . *.* (*i.e*., to Africa
and northwards to New Guinea, which countries had then, as said, no
existence as yet) . . . "the other, straight-haired, was evolved farther
to the north in Asia . . . . and peopled Australia . . . " (p. 81).
"Behold," writes a MASTER, "the relics of that once great nation
(Lemuria of the Third Race) in *some* of the flat-headed aborigines of
your Australia" ("*Esoteric Buddhism,*" *p.* 65). But they belong to the
last remnants of the Seventh Sub-race of the Third. Prof. Haeckel must
also have *dreamt* a dream and seen for once a *true* vision!

It is to this period that we have to look for the first appearance of
the Ancestors of those, who are termed by us the most ancient peoples of
the world -- now called respectively the Aryan Hindus, the Egyptians,
and the oldest Persians, on the one hand, and the Chaldees and
Phoenicians on the other. These were governed by the DIVINE DYNASTIES,
*i.e*., kings and rulers who had of mortal man only his physical
appearance *as it was then,* but who were Beings from spheres higher and
more celestial than our own sphere will be, long Manvantaras hence. It
is useless of course to attempt to force their existence on sceptics.
*Their* greatest pride consists in proving their patronymic denomination
*as catarrhinides*; which fact they try to demonstrate on the alleged

authority of the *Coccyx* appended to their *os sacrum,* that
rudimentary tail which, if they only had it long enough, they would wag
in joy and for ever, in honour of its eminent discoverer. These will
remain as faithful to their ape-ancestors as Christians will to tailless
Adam. The Secret Doctrine, however, sets right on this point
theosophists and students of Occult Sciences.

If we regard the Second portion of the Third Race as the first
representatives of the *really human race* with solid bones, then
Haeckel's surmise that "the evolution of the primitive men took place .
. . . in *either* Southern Asia or . . . . Lemuria" -- Africa, whether
Eastern or Western being out of question -- is correct enough, if not
entirely so. To be accurate, however, in the same way that the evolution
of the First Race (from the bodies of the *pitars*) took place on seven
distinctly separated regions of the (then) only Earth at the arctic pole
-- so did the ultimate transformation of the Third occur: it began in
those northern regions, which have just been described a few pages back
as including Behring's Straits, and what there then was of dry land in
Central Asia, when the climate was semi-tropical even in the Arctic
regions and most adapted to the primitive wants of nascent physical man.
That region, however, has been more than once frigid and tropical in
turn since the appearance of man. The commentary tells us that the Third
Race was only about the middle point of its development when: --

"*The axle of the Wheel tilted. The Sun and Moon shone no longer over
the heads of that portion of the* **S**WEAT **B**ORN; *people knew snow,
ice, and frost, and men, plants, and animals were dwarfed in their
growth. Those that did not perish* REMAINED AS HALF-GROWN BABES\* IN
SIZE AND INTELLECT. *This was the third pralaya of the races.\*\**

Which means again, that our globe is subject to seven periodical
*entire* changes which go *pari passu* with the races. For the Secret
Doctrine teaches that, during this Round, there must be seven
terrestrial *pralayas,* three occasioned by the change in the
inclination of the earth's axis. It is a *law* which acts at its
appointed time, and not at all blindly, as science may think, but in
strict accordance and harmony with *Karmic* law. In Occultism this
inexorable law is referred to as "the great ADJUSTER." Science confesses
its ignorance of the cause producing climatic vicissitudes and such
changes in the axial direction, which are always followed by these
vicissitudes; nor does it seem so sure of the axial changes. And being
unable to account for them, it is prepared rather to deny the axial
phenomena altogether, than admit the intelligent Karmic hand and

law which alone could reasonably explain such sudden changes and their
results. It has tried to account for them by various more or less
fantastic speculations; one of which would be the sudden, and as
imaginary, collision of our earth with a comet (De Boucheporn's
hypothesis), as the cause of all the geological revolutions. But we
prefer holding to our esoteric explanation, since **F**OHAT is as good
as any comet, having, in addition, universal intelligence to guide him.

Thus, since Vaivasvata Manu's Humanity appeared on this Earth, there
have already been four such axial disturbances; when the old continents
-- save the first one -- were sucked in by the oceans, other lands
appeared, and huge mountain chains arose where there had been none
before. The face of the Globe was completely changed each time; the
*survival of the fittest* nations and races was secured through timely
help; and the unfit ones -- the failures -- were disposed of by being
swept off the earth. Such sorting and shifting does not happen between
sunset and sunrise, as one may think, but requires several thousands of
years before the new house is set in order.

The *Sub*-races are subject to the same cleansing process, as also the
side-branchlets (the family-Races). Let one, well-acquainted with
astronomy and mathematics, throw a retrospective glance into the
twilight and shadows of the Past. Let him observe, take notes of what he
knows of the history of peoples and nations, and collate their
respective rises and falls with what is known of astronomical cycles --
especially with the *Sidereal year,* equal to 25,868 of our solar
years.\* If the observer is gifted with the faintest intuition, then
will he find how the weal and woe of nations is intimately connected
with the beginning and close of this sidereal cycle. True, the
non-occultist has the disadvantage that he has no such far distant times
to rely upon. He knows nothing, through exact Science, of what took
place nearly 10,000 years ago; yet he may find consolation in the
knowledge or -- if he so prefers -- speculation on the fate of every one
of the modern nations he knows of -- about 16,000 years hence.

###### \[\[Footnote(s)\]\] -------------------------------------------------

\* There are other cycles, of course, *cycles within cycles -*- and this
is just that which creates such a difficulty in the calculations of
racial events. The circuit of the ecliptic is completed in 25,868 years.
And, with regard to our Earth, it is calculated that the equinoctial
point falls back fifty minutes ten seconds, annually. But there is
another cycle within this one. It is said that "as the apsis goes
forward to meet it at the rate of eleven minutes twenty-four seconds,
annually," (see the article on *Astronomy in Encyclopaedia Britannica*),
"this would complete a revolution in one hundred and fifteen thousand
three hundred and two years (115,302). The approximation of the equinox
and the apsis is the sum of these motions, sixty-one minutes thirty-four
seconds, and hence the equinox returns to the same position in relation
to the apsis in 21,128 years." We have mentioned this cycle in *Isis
Unveiled,* Vol. I., in relation to other cycles. Each has a marked
influence on its contemporary race.

###### \[\[Vol. 2, Page\]\] 331 PRE-HISTORIC STATUES.

Our meaning is very clear. Every sidereal year the tropics recede from
the pole *four degrees* in each revolution from the equinoctial points,
as the equator rounds through the Zodiacal constellations. Now, as every
astronomer knows, at present the tropic is only twenty-three degrees and
a fraction less than half a degree from the equator. Hence it has still
2 1/2 degrees to run before the end of the Sidereal year; which gives
humanity in general, and our civilized races in *particular,* a reprieve
of about 16,000 years.\*

After the Great Flood of the Third Race (the Lemurians) --

"*Men decreased considerably in stature, and the duration of their lives
was diminished. Having fallen down in godliness they mixed with animal
races, and intermarried among giants and Pigmies* (the dwarfed races of
the Poles) . . . *Many acquired DIVINE, more* -- UNLAWFUL *knowledge,
and followed willingly the* **LEFT PATH.**" (Commentary xxxiii.)

Thus were the Atlanteans approaching destruction in their turn. How many
geological periods it took to accomplish this *fourth* destruction? Who
can tell. . . . But we are told that --

-------

(44.) **T**HEY (*the Atlanteans*) BUILT GREAT IMAGES, NINE YATIS HIGH
(27 *feet*) *--* THE SIZE OF THEIR BODIES (*a*). **L**UNAR FIRES HAD
DESTROYED THE LAND OF THEIR FATHERS (*the Lemurians*). **W**ATER
THREATENED THE **F**OURTH (*Race*) (*b*)*.*

(*a*) It is well worth noticing that most of the gigantic statues
discovered on Easter Island, a portion of an undeniably submerged
continent -- as also those found on the outskirts of Gobi, a region
which had been submerged for untold ages -- are all between 20 and 30
feet high. The statues found by Cook on Easter Island measured almost
all *twenty-seven* feet in height, and eight feet across the shoulders.
(*See §* "*Stones, Witnesses to Giants,*" at the end of this Stanza.)
The writer is well aware that the modern archaeologists have decided now
that "these statues are not very old," as declared by one of the high
officials of the British Museum, where some of them now are. But this is
one of those arbitrary decisions of modern science which does not carry
much weight.

We are told that it is after the destruction of "Lemuria" by
subterranean fires that men went on steadily decreasing in stature -- a
process already commenced after their *physical* **F**ALL *-*- and that
finally, some millions of years after, they reached between six and
seven feet, and are now dwindling down (as the older Asiatic races) to
nearer five than

six feet. As Pickering shows, there is in the Malay race (a sub-race of
the Fourth Root Race) a singular diversity of stature; the members of
the Polynesian family (Tahitians, Samoans, and Tonga islanders) are of a
*higher stature than the rest of mankind*; but the Indian tribes and the
inhabitants of the Indo-Chinese countries are decidedly below the
general average. This is easily explained. The Polynesians belong to the
very earliest of the surviving sub-races, the others to the very last
and transitory stock. As the Tasmanians are now completely extinct, and
the Australians rapidly dying out, so will the other old races soon
follow.

(*b*) Now, how could those records have been preserved? we may be asked.
Even the knowledge of the Zodiac is denied to the Hindus by our kind and
learned Orientalists, who *conclude* that the Aryan Hindus knew nothing
of it, before the Greeks brought it into the country. This uncalled-for
slander was so sufficiently refuted by Bailly, and what is more, by the
clear *evidence of facts,* as not to need very much additional
refutation. While the Egyptians have on their Zodiacs (See *Denon*'*s*
"*Voyage en Egypte*" *Vol. II.*) irrefutable proofs of records having
embraced more than three-and-a-half *sidereal years --* or about 87,000
years -- the Hindu calculations cover nearly thirty-three such years, or
850,000 years. The Egyptian priests assured Herodotus that the Pole of
the Earth and the Pole of the Ecliptic had formerly coincided. But, as
remarked by the author of the *Sphinxiad,* "These *poor benighted*
Hindoos have registered a knowledge of Astronomy for ten times 25,000
years since the (last local) *Flood* (in Asia), or *Age of Horror,*" in
the latitude of India. And they possess recorded observations from the
date of the first *Great* Flood within the Aryan *historical* memory --
that which submerged the last portions of Atlantis, 850,000 years ago.
The floods which preceded are, of course, more traditional than
historical.

The sinking and transformation of Lemuria beginning nearly at the Arctic
Circle (Norway), the Third Race ended its career in Lanka, or rather on
that which became Lanka with the Atlanteans. The small remnant now known
as Ceylon is the Northern highland of ancient Lanka, while the enormous
island of that name was, in the Lemurian period, the gigantic continent
described a few pages back. As a **M**ASTER says (See "*Esoteric
Buddhism,*" p*.* 65): -- "Why should not your geologists bear in mind
that under the continents explored and fathomed by them . . . . there
may be hidden, deep in the fathomless, or rather unfathomed ocean beds,
other and far older continents whose strata have never been geologically
explored; and that they may some day upset entirely their present
theories? Why not admit that our present continents have, like Lemuria
and Atlantis,

been several times already submerged, and had the time to re-appear
again and bear their new groups of mankind and civilisations; and that
at the first great geological upheaval at the next cataclysm, in the
series of periodical cataclysms that occur from the beginning to the end
of every Round, our already autopsized continents will go down and the
Lemurias and Atlantises come up again?"

Not the *same* identical continents, of course.

But here an explanation is needed. No confusion need arise as regards
the postulation of a Northern "Lemuria." The prolongation of that great
continent into the North Atlantic Ocean is in no way subversive of the
opinions so widely held as to the site of the lost Atlantis, and one
corroborates the other. It must be noted that the Lemuria, which served
as the cradle of the Third Root-Race, not only embraced a vast area in
the Pacific and Indian Oceans, but extended in the shape of a horse-shoe
past Madagascar, round "South Africa" (then a mere fragment in process
of formation), through the Atlantic up to Norway. The great *English
fresh-water deposit called the Wealden -- which every geologist regards
as the mouth of a former great river -- is the bed of the main stream
which drained Northern Lemuria in the Secondary Age.* The former reality
of this river is a fact of science -- will its votaries acknowledge the
necessity of accepting the Secondary-age Northern Lemuria, which their
data demand? Professor Berthold Seeman not only accepted the reality of
such a mighty continent, but regarded *Australia and Europe as formerly
portions of one continent --* thus corroborating the whole "horse-shoe"
doctrine already enunciated. No more striking confirmation of our
position could be given, than the fact that the ELEVATED RIDGE in the
Atlantic basin, 9,000 feet in height, which runs for some two or three
thousand miles southwards from a point near the British Islands, first
slopes towards South America, then *shifts almost at right angles* to
proceed in a SOUTH-EASTERLY *line toward the African coast,* whence it
runs on southward to Tristan d'Acunha. This ridge is a remnant of an
Atlantic continent, and, could it be traced further, would establish the
reality of a submarine horse-shoe junction with a former continent in
the Indian Ocean. (*Cf. chart adapted from the* "*Challenger*" *and*
"*Dolphin*" *soundings in Mr. Donnelly*'*s,* "*Atlantis, the
Antediluvian World,*" *p.* 47.)

*The Atlantic portion of Lemuria* was the geological basis of what is
generally known as Atlantis. The latter, indeed, must be regarded rather
as a development of the Atlantic prolongation of Lemuria, than as an
entirely new mass of land upheaved to meet the special requirements of
the Fourth Root-Race. Just as in the case of Race-evolution, so in that
of the shifting and re-shifting of continental masses, no hard and fast
line can be drawn where a new order ends and another begins. Continuity
in natural processes is never broken. Thus the Fourth Race

------------------------------------------------------------------------

###### \[\[Vol. 2, Page\]\] 334 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.

Atlanteans were developed from a nucleus of Northern Lemurian Third Race
Men, centred, roughly speaking, toward a point of land in what is now
the mid-Atlantic Ocean. Their continent was formed by the coalescence of
many islands and peninsulas which were upheaved in the ordinary course
of time *and became ultimately the true home of the great Race known as
the Atlanteans.* After this consummation was once attained it follows,
as stated on the highest "occult" authority, that "Lemuria should no
more be confounded with the Atlantis Continent, than Europe with
America." ("*Esoteric Buddhism,*" p. 58.)

The above, coming from quarters so discredited by orthodox Science,
will, of course, be regarded by it as a more or less happy fiction. Even
the clever work of Donnelly, already mentioned, is put aside,
notwithstanding that its statements are all confined within a frame of
strictly scientific proofs. But we write for the future. Discoveries in
this direction will vindicate the claims of the Asiatic philosophers,
who maintain that Sciences -- Geology, Ethnology, and History included
--were pursued by the Antediluvian nations who lived an untold number of
ages ago. Future finds will justify the correctness of the present
observations of such acute minds as H. A. Taine and Renan. The former
shows that the civilizations of such archaic nations as the Egyptians,
Aryans of India, Chaldeans, Chinese, and Assyrians are the result of
preceding civilizations during "*myriads* of centuries";\* and the
latter points to the fact that, "Egypt at the beginning appears mature,
old, and entirely without mythical and heroic ages, as if the country
had never known youth. Its civilization has no infancy, and its art no
archaic period. The civilization of the Old Monarchy did not begin with
infancy. It was already mature."\*\* To this Professor R. Owen adds
that, "Egypt is recorded to have been a civilized and governed community
*before* the time of Menes"; and Winchell ("Pre-Adamites," p. 120), that
"at the epoch of Menes the Egyptians were already a civilized and
numerous people. Manetho tells us that Athotis, the son of this first
king Menes, built the palace of Memphis; that he was a physician, and
left *anatomical books.*"

This is quite natural if we have to believe the statements of Herodotus,
who records in *Euterpe* (cxlii.), that the written history of the
Egyptian priests dated from about 12,000 years before his time. But what
are 12,000 or even 120,000 years compared with the millions of years
elapsed since the Lemurian period? The latter, however, has not been
left without witnesses, its tremendous antiquity, notwithstanding. The
complete records of the growth, development, social, and even political
life of the Lemurians, have been preserved in the

secret annals. Unfortunately, few are those who can read them; and those
who could would still be unable to understand the language, unless
acquainted with all the seven keys of its symbolism. For the
comprehension of the Occult Doctrine is based on that of the seven
sciences; which sciences find their expression in the seven different
applications of the secret records to the exoteric texts. Thus we have
to deal with modes of thought on seven entirely different planes of
Ideality. Every text relates to, and has to be rendered from, one of the
following standpoints --

> 1\. The Realistic plane of thought;  
> 2. The Idealistic;  
> 3. The purely Divine or Spiritual.

The other planes too far transcend the average consciousness, especially
of the materialistic mind, to admit of their being even symbolized in
terms of ordinary phraseology. There is no purely *mythical* element in
any of the ancient religious texts; but the mode of thought in which
they were originally written has to be found out and closely adhered to
during the process of interpretation. For, it is either symbolical
(archaic mode of thought), emblematical (a later though very ancient
mode of thought), parabolical (allegory), hieroglyphical, or again
*logo-grammical --* the most difficult method of all, as every letter,
as in the Chinese language, represents a whole word. Thus, almost every
proper name, whether in the Vedas, the "Book of the Dead," or the Bible
(to a degree), is composed of such logograms. No one who is not
initiated into the mystery of the occult religious logography can
presume to know what a name in any ancient fragment means, before he has
mastered the meaning of every letter that composes it. How is it to be
expected that the merely profane thinker, however great his erudition in
*orthodox* symbolism, so to say -- *i.e*., in that symbolism which can
never get out of the old grooves of Solar-myth and sexual-worship --
shall penetrate into the arcana. behind the veil. One who deals with the
husk or shell of the dead letter, and devotes himself to the
kaleidoscopic transformation of barren word-symbols, can never expect to
get beyond the vagaries of modern mythologists.

Thus, Vaivasvata, Xisuthrus, Deukalion, Noah, etc., etc. -- all the
head-figures of the world-deluges, universal and partial, astronomical
or geological -- all furnish in their very names the records of the
causes and effects which led to the event, if one can but read them
fully. All such deluges are based on events that took place in nature,
and stand as *historical* records, therefore, whether they were
sidereal, geological, or even simply allegorical, of a moral event on
other and higher planes of being. This we believe has now been
sufficiently demonstrated during the long explanation necessitated by
the allegorical Stanzas.

To speak of a race nine *yatis,* or 27 feet high, in a work claiming a
more scientific character than "Jack the Giant-Killer," is a somewhat
unusual proceeding. "Where are your proofs?" the writer will be asked.
In History and tradition, is the answer. Traditions about a race of
giants in days of old are universal; they exist in oral and written
lore. India had her Danavas and Daityas; Ceylon had her Rakshasas;
Greece, her Titans; Egypt, her colossal Heroes; Chaldea, her Izdubars
(Nimrod); and the Jews their *Emims* of the land of Moab, with the
famous giants, Anakim (*Numbers* xiii. 33). Moses speaks of Og, a king
who was nine cubits high (15 ft. 4 in.) and four wide (Deut. iii. 11),
and Goliath was "six cubits and a span in height" (or 10 ft. 7 in.). The
only difference found between the "revealed Scripture" and the evidence
furnished to us by Herodotus, Diodorus Siculus, Homer, Pliny, Plutarch,
Philostratus, etc., etc., is this: While the pagans mention only *the
skeletons of giants,* dead untold ages before, relics that some of *them
had personally seen,* the Bible interpreters unblushingly demand that
geology and archaeology should believe, that several countries were
inhabited by such giants in the day of Moses; giants before whom the
Jews were as grasshoppers, and who still existed in the days of Joshua
and David. Unfortunately their own chronology is in the way. Either the
latter or the giants have to be given up. (But see Part III., *Addenda,*
the closing chapter.)

Of still standing witnesses to the submerged continents, and the
colossal men that inhabited them, there are still a few. Archaeology
claims several such on this globe, though beyond wondering "what these
may be" -- it never made any serious attempt to solve the mystery.
Besides the Easter Island statues mentioned already, to what epoch do
the colossal statues, still erect and intact near Bamian, belong?
Archaeology assigns them to the first centuries of Christianity (as
usual), and errs in this as it does in many other speculations. A few
words of description will show the readers what are the statues of both
Easter Isle and Bamian. We will first examine what is known of them to
orthodox Science. In "*The Countries of the World*," *by* Robert Brown,
in Vol. **IV**., page 43, it is stated that --

> "Teapi, Rapa-nui, or Easter Island, is an isolated spot almost 2,000
> miles from the South American coast. . . . In length it is about
> twelve miles, in breadth four . . . and there is an extinct crater
> 1,050 feet high in its centre. The island abounds in craters, which
> have been extinct for so long that no tradition of their activity
> remains. . . .

> " . . . But who made the great stone images (p. 44, etc.) which are

"**T**HERE IS NO REASON TO BELIEVE THAT ANY OF THE STATUES HAVE BEEN
BUILT UP, BIT BY BIT, BY SCAFFOLDING ERECTED AROUND THEM" -- adds the
journal very suggestively -- without explaining *how* they could be
built otherwise, unless made by giants of the same size as the statues
themselves. One of the best of these colossal images is now in the
British Museum. The images at Ronororaka -- the only ones now found
erect -- are four in number, three deeply sunk in the soil, and one
resting on the back of its head like the head of a man asleep. Their
types, though all are long-headed, are different; and they are evidently
meant for portraits, as the noses, the mouths and chins differ greatly
in form, their head-dress, moreover -- a kind of flat cap with a back
piece attached to it to cover the back portion of the head --showing
that the originals were no savages of the stone period. Verily the
question may be asked -- "Who made them?" -- but it is not archaeology
nor yet geology that is likely to answer, though the latter recognizes
in the Island a portion of a submerged continent.

But who cut the Bamian, still more colossal, statues, the tallest and
the most gigantic in the whole world, for Bartholdi's "Statue of
Liberty" (now at New York) *is a dwarf* when compared with the largest
of the five images. Burnes, and several learned Jesuits who have visited
the place, speak of a mountain "*all honeycombed with gigantic cells,*"
with two immense giants cut in the same rock. They are referred to as
the modern *Miaotse* (*vide supra,* quotation from *Shoo-King*) the last
surviving witnesses of the *Miaotse* who had "troubled the earth"; the
Jesuits are right, and the Archaeologists, who see Buddhas in the
largest of these statues, are mistaken. For all those numberless
gigantic ruins discovered one after the other in our day, all those
immense avenues of colossal ruins that cross North America along and
beyond the Rocky Mountains, are the work of the Cyclopes, the true and
actual Giants of old. "Masses of enormous human bones" were found "in
America, near Misorte," a celebrated modern traveller tells us,
precisely on the spot which local tradition points out as the landing

spot of those giants who overran America when it had hardly arisen from
the waters (See "*De La Vega,*" *Vol.* ix., ch. ix.).\*

Central Asian traditions say the same of the Bamian statues. What are
they, and what is the place where they have stood for countless ages,
defying the cataclysms around them, and even the hand of man, as in the
instance of the hordes of Timoor and the Vandal-warriors of Nadir-Shah?
Bamian is a small, miserable, half-ruined town in Central Asia, half-way
between Cabul and Balkh, at the foot of Kobhibaba, a huge mountain of
the Paropamisian (or Hindu-Kush) chain, some 8,500 feet above the level
of the sea. In days of old, Bamian was a portion of the ancient city of
Djooljool, ruined and destroyed to the last stone by Tchengis-Khan in
the **XIII**th century. The whole valley is hemmed in by colossal rocks,
which are full of partially natural and partially artificial caves and
grottoes, once the dwellings of Buddhist monks who had established in
them their *viharas. Such viharas* are to be met with in profusion, to
this day, in the rock-cut temples of India and the valleys of
Jellalabad. It is at the entrance of some of these that five enormous
statues, of what is regarded as Buddha, have been discovered or rather
*rediscovered* in our century, as the famous Chinese traveller,
Hiouen-Thsang, speaks of, and saw them, when he visited Bamian in the
**VII**th century.

When it is maintained that no larger statues exist on the whole globe,
the fact is easily proven on the evidence of all the travellers who have
examined them and taken their measurements. Thus, the largest is 173
feet high, or *seventy* feet higher than the "Statue of Liberty" now at
New York, as the latter is only 105 feet or 34 metres high. The famous
Colossus of Rhodes itself, between whose limbs passed easily the largest
vessels of those days, measured only 120 to 130 feet in height. The
second statue, cut out in the rock like the first one, is only 120 feet
(15 feet taller than the said "Liberty").\*\* The third statue is only
60 feet high -- the two others still smaller, the last one being only a
little larger than the average tall man of our present race. The first
and largest of the Colossi represents a man draped in a kind of *toga*;
*M.* de Nadeylac thinks (See *infra*) that the general appearance of the
figure, the lines of the head, the drapery, and especially the large
hanging ears, point out undeniably that Buddha was meant to be
represented. But the above proves nothing. Notwithstanding the fact

\* See also "*Pneumatologie des Esprits*" *Vol. III., p. 55, de
Mirville.*

\*\* The first and second have, in common with Bartholdi's Statue, an
entrance at the foot, leading by a winding staircase cut in the rock up
into the heads of the statues. The eminent French archeologist and
anthropologist, the Marquis de Nadeylac, justly remarks in his work that
there never was in ancient or in modern times a sculptured human figure
more colossal than the first of the two.

that most of the now existing figures of Buddha, represented in the
posture of *Samadhi,* have large drooping ears, this is a later
innovation and an afterthought. The primitive idea was due to esoteric
allegory. The unnaturally large ears symbolize the omniscience of
wisdom, and were meant as a reminder of the power of Him who *knows and
hears all,* and whose benevolent love and attention for all creatures
nothing can escape. "The merciful Lord, our Master, hears the cry of
agony of the smallest of the small, beyond vale and mountain, and
hastens to its deliverance": --says a Stanza. Gautama Buddha was an
Aryan Hindu, and an approach to such ears is found only among the
Mongolian Burmese and Siamese, who, as in Cochin, distort them
artificially. The Buddhist monks, who turned the grottos of the
*Miaotse* into *Viharas* and cells, came into Central Asia about or in
the first century of the Christian era. Therefore Hiouen Thsang,
speaking of the colossal statue, says that "the shining of the gold
ornamentation that overlaid the statue" in his day "dazzled one's eyes,"
but of such gilding there remains not a vestige in modern times. The
very drapery, in contrast to the figure itself, cut out in the standing
rock, is made of plaster and modelled over the stone image. Talbot, who
has made the most careful examination, found that this drapery belonged
to a far later epoch. The statue itself has therefore to be assigned to
a far earlier period than Buddhism. Whom does it represent in such case,
it may be asked?

Once more tradition, corroborated by written records, answers the query,
and explains the mystery. The Buddhist Arhats and Ascetics found the
five statues, and many more, now crumbled down to dust, and as the three
were found by them in colossal niches at the entrance of their future
abode, they covered the figures with plaster, and, over the old,
modelled new statues made to represent Lord Tathagata. The interior
walls of the niches are covered to this day with bright paintings of
human figures, and the sacred image of Buddha is repeated in every
group. These frescoes and ornaments -- which remind one of the Byzantine
style of painting -- are all due to the piety of the monk-ascetics, like
some other minor figures and rock-cut ornamentations. But the five
statues belong to the handiwork of the Initiates of the Fourth Race, who
sought refuge, after the submersion of their continent, in the
fastnesses and on the summits of the Central Asian mountain chains.
Moreover, the five statues are an imperishable record of the esoteric
teaching about the gradual evolution of the races.

The largest is made to represent the First Race of mankind, its ethereal
body being commemorated in hard, everlasting stone, for the instruction
of future generations, as its remembrance would otherwise never have

survived the Atlantean Deluge. The second -- 120 feet high -- represents
the sweat-born; and the third -- measuring 60 feet -- immortalizes the
race that fell, and thereby inaugurated the first *physical* race, born
of father and mother, the last descendants of which are represented in
the Statues found on Easter Isle; but they were only from 20 to 25 feet
in stature at the epoch when Lemuria was submerged, after it had been
nearly destroyed by volcanic fires. The Fourth Race was still smaller,
though gigantic in comparison with our present Fifth Race, and the
series culminated finally in the latter. (See the following sub-section
on "Cyclopean Ruins, and Colossal Stones as Witnesses to Giants.")

These are, then, the "Giants" of antiquity, the ante- and post-diluvian
*Gibborim* of the Bible. They lived and flourished one million rather
than between three and four thousand years ago. The *Anakim* of Joshua,
whose hosts were as "grasshoppers" in comparison with them, are thus a
piece of Israelite fancy, unless indeed the people of Israel claim for
Joshua an antiquity and origin in the Eocene, or at any rate in the
Miocene age, and change the millenniums of their chronology into
millions of years.

In everything that pertains to prehistoric times the reader ought to
bear the wise words of Montaigne in his mind. Saith the great French
philosopher: --

> " . . . It is a sottish presumption to disdaine and condemne that for
> false, which unto us seemeth to beare no show of likelihood or truth:
> which is an ordinarie fault in those who persuade themselves to be of
> more sufficiencie than the vulgar sort.

> " . . . But reason hath taught me, that so resolutely to condemne a
> thing for false and impossible, is to assume unto himself the
> advantage to have the bounds and limits of God's will, and the power
> of our common Mother Nature tied to his sleeve, and that there is no
> greater folly in the world than to reduce them to the measure of our
> capacitie and bounds of our sufficiencie.

> "If we term those things monsters or miracles to which our reason
> cannot attain, how many doe such daily present themselves unto our
> sight? Let us consider through what cloudes, and how blinde-folde we
> are led to the knowledge of most things that passe our hands; verily
> we shall finde it is rather custome than Science that receiveth, the
> strangenesse of them from us: and that those things, were they newly
> presented unto us, wee should doubtless deeme them as much or more
> unlikely and incredible than any other." (*Essays,* chap. xxvi.)

A fair-minded scholar should, before denying the possibility of *our*
history and records, search modern History, as well as the universal
traditions scattered throughout ancient and modern literature, for
traces left by these marvellous early races. Few among the unbelievers
suspect the wealth of corroborative evidence which is found scattered
about and buried even in the British Museum alone. The
