#### ยง VIII. THE LOTUS, AS A UNIVERSAL SYMBOL.

**T**HERE are no ancient symbols, without a deep and philosophical
meaning attached to them; their importance and significance increasing
with their antiquity. Such is the **L**OTUS. It is the flower sacred to
nature and her Gods, and represents the abstract and the Concrete
Universes, standing as the emblem of the productive powers of both
spiritual and physical nature. It was held sacred from the remotest
antiquity by the Aryan Hindus, the Egyptians, and the Buddhists after
them; revered in China and Japan, and adopted as a Christian emblem by
the Greek and Latin Churches, who made of it a messenger as the
Christians do now, who replace it with the water lily.\* It had, and
still has, its mystic meaning which is identical with every nation on
the earth. We refer the reader to Sir William Jones.\*\* With the
Hindus, the lotus is the emblem of the productive power of nature,
through the agency of fire and water (spirit and matter). "Eternal!"
says a verse in the Bhagavad Gita, "I see Brahm the creator enthroned in
thee above the lotus!"; and Sir W. Jones shows, as noted in the Stanzas,
that the seeds of the lotus contain, even before they germinate,
perfectly-formed leaves, the miniature shapes of what one day, as
perfected plants, they will become. The lotus, in India, is the symbol
of prolific earth, and what is more, of Mount Meru. The four angels or
genii of the four quarters of Heaven (the Maharajahs, see *Stanzas*)
stand each on a lotus. The lotus is the two-fold type of the Divine and
human hermaphrodite, being of dual sex, so to say.

The spirit of Fire (or Heat), which stirs up, fructifies, and develops
into concrete form everything (from its ideal prototype), which is born
of WATER or primordial Earth, evolved Brahma -- with the Hindus. The
lotus flower, represented as growing out of Vishnu's navel -- that God
resting on the waters of space and his Serpent of Infinity -- is the
most graphic allegory ever made: the Universe evolving from the central
Sun, the POINT, the ever-concealed germ. Lakshmi, who is the

\* In the Christian religion Gabriel, the Archangel, holding in his hand
a spray of water lilies, appears to the Virgin Mary in every picture of
the Annunciation. This spray typifying fire and water, or the idea of
creation and generation, symbolizes *precisely the same idea as the
lotus* in the hand of the Bodhisat who announces to Maha-Maya, Gautama's
mother, the birth of the world's Saviour, Buddha. Thus also, Osiris and
Horus were represented by the Egyptians constantly in association with
the lotus-flower, the two being Sun-gods or Fire (the Holy Ghost being
still typified by "tongues of fire"), (Acts).

female aspect of Vishnu,\* and who is also called *Padma*, the lotus, is
likewise shown floating at "Creation," on a lotus flower, and during the
"churning of the ocean" of space, springing from the "sea of milk," like
Venus from the froth.

> ". . . Then seated on a lotus  
> Beauty's bright goddess, peerless Sri, arose  
> Out of the waves . . . "

sings an English Orientalist and poet (Sir Monier Williams).

The underlying idea in this symbol is very beautiful, and it shows,
furthermore, its identical parentage in all the religious systems.
Whether in the lotus or water-lily shape it signifies one and the same
philosophical idea -- namely, the emanation of the objective from the
subjective, divine Ideation passing from the abstract into the concrete
or visible form. For, as soon as **D**ARKNESS -- or rather that which is
"darkness" for ignorance -- has disappeared in its own realm of eternal
Light, leaving behind itself only its divine manifested Ideation, the
creative Logoi have their understanding opened, and they see in the
ideal world (hitherto concealed in the divine thought) the archetypal
forms of all, and proceed to copy and build or fashion upon these models
forms evanescent and transcendent.

At this stage of action, the Demiurge\*\* is not yet the Architect. Born
in the twilight of action, he has yet to first perceive the plan, to
realise the ideal forms which lie buried in the bosom of Eternal
Ideation, as the future lotus-leaves, the immaculate petals, are
concealed within the seed of that plant. . . . .

In chapter lxxxi. of the *Ritual* (*Book of the Dead*), called
"Transformation into the Lotus," a head emerging from this flower, the
god exclaims: "I am the pure lotus, emerging from the Luminous one. . .
. . I carry the messages of Horus. I am the pure lotus which comes from
the Solar Fields. . . . ."

The lotus-idea may be traced even in the Elohistic chapter, the 1st of
*Genesis*, as stated in *Isis.*

###### \[\[Footnote(s)\]\] -------------------------------------------------

\* Lakshmi is Venus -- Aphrodite, and, like the latter, she sprang from
the froth of the ocean with a lotus in her hand. In the Ramayana she is
called Padma.

\*\* In Esoteric philosophy the Demiurge or *Logos*, regarded as the
**C**REATOR, is simply an abstract term, an idea, like "army." As the
latter is the all-embracing term for a body of active forces or working
units -- soldiers -- so is the Demiurge the qualitative compound of a
multitude of Creators or Builders. Burnouf, the great Orientalist, has
seized the idea perfectly when saying that Brahma does *not* create the
earth, any more than the rest of the universe. "Having evolved himself
from the soul of the world, once separated from the first cause, he
evaporates with, and emanates all nature out of himself. He does not
stand above it, but is mixed up with it; Brahma and the universe form
one Being, each particle of which is in its essence Brahma himself, who
proceeded out of himself."

------------------------------------------------------------------------

###### \[\[Vol. 1, Page\]\] 381 THE EXOTERIC AND THE ESOTERIC.

It is in this idea that we must look for the origin and explanation of
the verse in the Jewish cosmogony, which reads: "And God said, Let the
earth bring forth . . . . the fruit-tree yielding fruit after his kind,
whose seed is in itself." In all the primitive religions, the "Son of
the Father" is the creative God -- *i.e.*, His thought made visible; and
before the Christian era, from the Trimurti of the Hindus down to the
three kabalistic heads of the scriptures as explained by the Jews, the
triune godhead of each nation was fully defined and substantiated in its
allegories.

Such is the cosmic and ideal significance of this great symbol with the
Eastern peoples. But, applied to practical and exoteric worship -- which
had also its esoteric symbology -- the lotus became in time the carrier
and container of a more terrestrial idea. No dogmatic religion has ever
escaped the sexual element in it; and to this day it soils the moral
beauty of the root idea. The following is quoted from the same
Kabalistic **MSS**. already mentioned: --

> "Pointing to like signification was the lotus growing in the waters of
> the Nile. Its mode of growth peculiarly fitted it as a symbol of the

\* In Indian Puranas it is Vishnu, the first, and Brahma, the second
logos, or the ideal and practical creators, who are respectively
represented, one as manifesting the lotus, the other as issuing from it.

\*\* Not the "efforts" of the trained psychic faculties of an Initiate
into Eastern metaphysics, and the mysteries of creative Nature. It is
the profane of the past ages who have degraded the pure ideal of cosmic
creation into an emblem of mere human reproduction and sexual functions:
it is the esoteric teachings, and the initiates of the Future, whose
mission it is, and will be, to redeem and ennoble once more the
primitive conception so sadly profaned by its crude and gross
application to exoteric dogmas and personations by theological and
ecclesiastical religionists. The silent worship of abstract or
*noumenal* Nature, the only divine manifestation, is the one ennobling
religion of Humanity.

This is a correct rendering of the underlying ideas of old, of the
purely pantheistic conceptions, *impersonal* and reverential, of the
archaic philosophers of the prehistoric ages. Not so, however, when
applied to sinful humanity, to the gross ideas attached to personality.
Therefore, no pantheistic philosopher would fail to find the remarks
that follow the above and which represent the anthropomorphism of Judean
symbology, other than dangerous for the sacredness of true religion, and
fitting only our materialistic age, which is the direct outcome and
result of that anthropomorphic character. For this is the key-note to
the entire spirit and essence of the Old Testament. "Therefore," goes on
the MSS., treating of the symbolism of art-speech of the Bible: --

> "The locality of the *womb* is to be taken as the MOST HOLY PLACE, the
> SANCTUM SANCTORUM, and the *veritable* **T**EMPLE OF THE **L**IVING
> **G**OD.\* With man the possession of the woman has always been

No such thought "carried to the extreme" ever existed among the old
primitive Aryans. This is proven by the fact that in the Vedic period
their women were not placed apart from men in *penetralia*, or
"Zenanas." Their seclusion began when the Mahomedans -- the next heirs
to Hebrew symbolism after Christian ecclesiasticism -- had conquered the
land and gradually enforced their ways and customs upon the Hindus. The
pre- and *post-*Vedic woman was as free as man; and no impure
terrestrial thought was ever mixed with the religious symbo-

###### \[\[Footnote(s)\]\] -------------------------------------------------

\* Surely the words of the old Initiate into the *primitive* mysteries
of Christianity, "*Know ye not ye are the Temple of God*" (I Corinth.
*iii*. 16) could not be applied in *this* sense to *men?* The meaning
may have been, and *was* so, undeniably, in the minds of the Hebrew
compilers of the *Old* Testament. And here is the abyss that lies
between the symbolism of the New Testament and the Jewish canon. This
gulf would have remained and ever widened, had not Christianity --
especially and most glaringly the Latin Church -- thrown a bridge over
it? Modern Popery has now spanned it entirely, by its dogma of the two
immaculate conceptions, and the anthropomorphic and at the same time
idolatrous character it has conferred upon the Mother of its God.

\*\* It was so carried *only* in the Hebrew Bible, and its servile
copyist, Christian theology.

logy of the early Aryans. The idea and application are purely Semitic.
This is corroborated by the writer of the said intensely learned and
Kabalistic revelation himself, when he closes the above-quoted passages
by adding: --

> "If to these organs as symbols of creative cosmic agencies the idea of
> the origin of measures as well as of time-periods can be attached,
> then indeed, in the constructions of the Temples as Dwellings of
> Deity, or of Jehovah, that part designated as the Holy of Holies, or

> sacredness of the generative organs, considered as symbols of measures
> as well as of creative cause. With the ancient WISE, *there was no
> name and no idea*, *and no symbol* of A FIRST CAUSE." . . . .

Most decidedly not. Rather never give a thought to it and leave it for
ever *nameless*, as the early Pantheists did, than degrade the
sacredness of that *Ideal of Ideals*, by dragging down its symbols into
such anthropomorphic forms! Here again one perceives the immense chasm
between Aryan and Semitic religious thought: two opposite poles --
Sincerity and Concealment. With the Brahmins, who have never invested
with an "original Sin" element the natural procreative functions of
mankind, it is a *religious duty* to have a son. A Brahmin, in days of
old, having accomplished his mission of human creator, retired to the
jungle and passed the rest of his days in religious meditations. He had
accomplished his duty to nature as mortal man and its co-worker, and
henceforth gave all his thoughts to the spiritual immortal portion in
himself, regarding the terrestrial as a mere illusion, an evanescent
dream -- which it is. With the Semite, it was different. He invented a
temptation of flesh in a garden of Eden; showed his God (esoterically,
the Tempter and the Ruler of Nature) CURSING *for ever* an act, which
was in the logical programme of that nature.\* All this exoterically, as
in the *cloak* and dead letter of Genesis and the rest; and at the same
time *esoterically* he regarded the supposed *sin* and FALL as an act so
sacred, as to choose the organ, the perpetrator of the *original sin*,
as the fittest and most sacred symbol to represent that God, who is
shown as branding its entering into function as disobedience and
everlasting SIN!

Who can ever fathom the paradoxical depths of the Semitic mind? And this
paradoxical element, *minus* its innermost significance, has now passed
entirely into Christian theology and dogma!

Whether the early Fathers of the Church knew the esoteric meaning of the
Hebrew (Old) Testament, or whether only a few of them were aware of it,
while the others remained ignorant of the secret, is for

###### \[\[Footnote(s)\]\] -------------------------------------------------

\* The same idea is carried out exoterically in the incidents of Egypt.
The Lord God tempts sorely Pharaoh and "plagues him with great plagues,"
lest the king should escape punishment, and thus afford no pretext for
one more triumph to his "Chosen people."

------------------------------------------------------------------------

posterity to decide. One thing is certain, at any rate. As the
esotericism of the New Testament agrees perfectly with that of the
Hebrew Mosaic Books; and since, at the same time, a number of purely
Egyptian symbols and pagan dogmas in general -- the Trinity for example
-- have been copied by, and incorporated into, the Synoptics and St.
John, it becomes evident that the identity of those symbols was known to
the writers of the New Testament, whoever they were. They must have been
aware also of the priority of the Egyptian esotericism, since they have
adopted several such symbols that typify purely Egyptian conceptions and
beliefs -- in their outward and inward meaning -- and which are not to
be found in the Jewish Canon. One of such is the water-lily in the hands
of the Archangel in the early representations of his appearance to the
Virgin Mary; and these symbolical images are preserved to this day in
the iconography of the Greek and Roman Churches. Thus water, fire, the
Cross, as well as the Dove, the Lamb, and other sacred animals, with all
their combinations, yield esoterically an identical meaning, and must
have been accepted as an improvement upon Judaism pure and simple.

For the Lotus and Water are among the oldest symbols, and in their
origin are purely Aryan, though they became common property during the
branching-off of the fifth race. Let us give an example. Letters, as
much as numbers, were all mystic, whether in combination or each taken
separately. The most sacred of all is the letter M. It is both feminine
and masculine, or androgyne, and is made to symbolize WATER, the great
deep, in its origin. It is mystic in all the languages, Eastern and
Western, and stands as a glyph for the waves, thus: ![](sd1-384.gif). In
the Aryan Esotericism, as in the Semitic, this letter has always stood
for the waters; *e.g*., in Sanskrit MAKARA -- the tenth sign of the
Zodiac -- means a crocodile, or rather an aquatic monster associated
always with water. The letter MA is equivalent to and corresponds with
number 5 -- composed of a *binary*, the symbol of the two sexes
separated, and of the *ternary*, symbol of the third life, the progeny
of the *binary.* This, again, is often symbolised by a *Pentagon*, the
latter being a sacred sign, a divine Monogram. **M**AITREYA is the
secret name of the *Fifth* Buddha, and the *Kalki* Avatar of the
Brahmins -- the last **M**ESSIAH who will come at the culmination of the
Great Cycle. It is also the initial letter of the Greek Metis or *Divine
Wisdom*; of *Mimra*, the "word" or *Logos*; and of *Mithras* (the
*Mihr*), the *Monad*, *Mystery.* All these are born in, and from, the
great Deep, and are the Sons of *Maya* -- the *Mother;* in Egypt,
*Mouth*, in Greece *Minerva* (divine wisdom), *Mary*, or *Miriam*,
*Myrrha*, etc.; of the Mother of the Christian Logos, and of *Maya*, the
mother of Buddha. *Madhava* and *Madhavi* are the titles of the most
important gods and goddesses of the Hindu Pantheon. Finally, *Mandala*
is in

Sanskrit "a circle," or an orb (the ten divisions of the *Rig Veda*)*.*
The most sacred names in India begin with this letter generally -- from
*Mahat*, the first manifested intellect, and *Mandara*, the great
mountain used by the gods to churn the *Ocean*, down to *Mandakin*, the
heavenly *Ganga* (Ganges), *Manu*, etc., etc.

Shall this be called a coincidence? A strange one it is then, indeed,
when we find even Moses -- found in the water of the Nile -- having the
symbolical consonant in his name. And Pharaoh's daughter "called his
name Moses . . . because," she said, "*I drew him out of* **W**ATER"
(*Exod. ii.*, 10.)\* Besides which the Hebrew sacred name of God
*applied to this letter M* is *Meborach*, the "Holy" or the "Blessed,"
and the name for the water of the *Flood* is *M*'*bul.* A reminder of
the "*three* Maries" at the Crucifixion and their connection with *Mar*,
the Sea, or *Water*, may close this example. This is why in Judaism and
Christianity the *Messiah* is always connected with Water, Baptism, the
*Fishes* (the sign of the Zodiac called *Meenam* in Sanskrit), and even
with the *Matsya* (fish) Avatar, and the Lotus -- the symbol of the
womb, or the water-lily, which is the same.

In the relics of ancient Egypt, the greater the antiquity of the votive
symbols and emblems of the objects exhumed, the oftener are the lotus
flowers and the water found in connection with the Solar Gods. The god
*Khnoom* -- the moist power -- water, as Thales taught it, being the
principle of all things, sits on a throne enshrined in a lotus (Saitic
epoch, *Serapeum*)*.* The god Bes stands on a lotus, ready to devour his
progeny. (*Ibid*, Abydos.) Thot, the god of mystery and Wisdom, the
sacred Scribe of Amenti, wearing the Solar disc as head gear, sits with
a bull's head (the sacred bull of Mendes being a form of Thot) and a
human body, on a full blown lotus. (*IVth Dynasty.*) Finally it is the
goddess *Hiquet*, under her shape of a frog, who rests on the lotus,
thus showing her connection with water. And it is this frog-symbol,
undeniably the most ancient of their Egyptian deities, from whose
unpoetical shape the Egyptologists have been vainly trying to unravel
her mystery and functions. Its adoption in the Church by the early
Christians shows that they knew it better than our modern Orientalists.
The "frog or toad goddess" was one of the chief cosmic deities connected
with creation, on account of her amphibious nature, and chiefly because
of her apparent resurrection, after long ages of solitary life enshrined
in old walls, in rocks, etc. She not only participated in the
organization of the world, together with *Khnoom*, but was also
connected with *the*

*dogma of resurrection.*\* There must have been some very profound and
sacred meaning attached to this symbol, since, notwithstanding the risk
of being charged with a disgusting form of zoolatry, the early Egyptian
Christians adopted it in their Churches. A frog or toad enshrined in a
lotus flower, or simply without the latter emblem, was the form chosen
*for the Church lamps*, on which were engraved the words "I am the
resurrection" "\[\[*ego eimi anastasis*\]\]."\*\* These frog goddesses
are also found on all the mummies.
