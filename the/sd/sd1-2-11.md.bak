**T**HIS symbolical sentence, in its many-sided forms, is certainly most
dangerous and iconoclastic in the face of all the dualistic later
religions -- or rather theologies -- and especially so in the light of
Christianity. Yet it is neither just nor correct to say that it is
Christianity which has conceived and brought forth Satan. As an
"adversary," the opposing Power required by the equilibrium and harmony
of things in Nature -- like Shadow to throw off still brighter the
Light, like Night to bring into greater *relief* the Day, and like cold
to make one appreciate the more the comfort of heat -- **S**ATAN has
ever existed. Homogeneity is one and indivisible. But if the homogeneous
One and Absolute is no mere figure of speech, and if heterogeneity in
its dualistic aspect, is its offspring -- its bifurcous shadow or
reflection -- then even that divine Homogeneity must contain in itself
the essence of

both good and evil. If "God" is Absolute, Infinite, and the Universal
Root of all and everything in Nature and its universe, whence comes Evil
or D'Evil if not from the same "Golden Womb" of the absolute? Thus we
are forced either to accept the emanation of good and evil, of
Agathodaemon and Kakodaemon as offshoots from the same trunk of the Tree
of Being, or to resign ourselves to the absurdity of believing in two
eternal Absolutes!

Having to trace the origin of the idea to the very beginnings of human
mind, it is but just, meanwhile, to give his due even to the proverbial
devil. Antiquity knew of no isolated, thoroughly and absolutely bad "god
of evil." Pagan thought represented good and evil as twin brothers, born
from the same mother -- Nature; so soon as that thought ceased to be
Archaic, Wisdom too became Philosophy. In the beginning the symbols of
good and evil were mere abstractions, Light and Darkness; then their
types became chosen among the most natural and ever-recurrent periodical
Cosmic phenomena -- the Day and the Night, or the Sun and Moon. Then the
Hosts of the Solar and Lunar deities were made to represent them, and
the Dragon of Darkness was contrasted with the Dragon of Light (See
*Stanzas* V*.*, VII. of Book I.) The Host of Satan is a Son of God, no
less than the Host of the B'ni Alhim, these children of God coming to
"present themselves before the Lord," their father (see *Job ii.*)*.*
"The Sons of God" become the "Fallen Angels" only after perceiving that
the daughters of men *were fair*, (*Genesis vi.*) In the Indian
philosophy, the *Suras* are among the earliest and the brightest gods,
and become *Asuras* only when dethroned by Brahminical fancy. Satan
never assumed an anthropomorphic, individualized shape, until the
creation by man, of a "one *living* personal god," had been
accomplished; and then merely as a matter of prime necessity. A screen
was needed; a scape-goat to explain the cruelty, blunders, and but
too-evident injustice, perpetrated by him for whom absolute perfection,
mercy, and goodness were claimed. This was the first Karmic effect of
abandoning a philosophical and logical Pantheism, to build, as a prop
for lazy man, "a merciful father in Heaven," whose daily and hourly
actions as *Natura naturans*, the "comely mother but stone cold," belie
the assumption. This led to the primal twins, Osiris-Typhon,
Ormazd-Ahriman, and finally Cain-Abel and the *tutti-quanti* of
contraries.

Having commenced by being synonymous with Nature, "God," the Creator,
ended by being made its author. Pascal settles the difficulty very
cunningly: "Nature has perfections, in order to show that she is the
image of God: and defects, in order to show that she is *only* his
image," he says.

The further back one recedes into the darkness of the prehistoric

ages, the more philosophical does the prototypic figure of the later
Satan appear. The first "Adversary" in individual human form that one
meets with in old Puranic literature is one of her greatest Rishis and
Yogis -- Narada, surnamed the "Strife-maker."

And he is a Brahmaputra, a son of Brahma, the male. But of him later on.
Who the great "Deceiver" really is, one can ascertain by searching for
him *with open eyes* and an unprejudiced mind, in every old cosmogony
and Scripture.

It is the anthropomorphised *Demiurge*, the Creator of Heaven and Earth,
when separated from the collective Hosts of his fellow-Creators, whom,
so to speak, he represents and synthesizes. It is *now* the God of
*theologies.* "The thought is father to the wish." Once upon a time, a
philosophical symbol left to perverse human fancy; afterwards fashioned
into a fiendish, deceiving, cunning, and jealous God.

Dragons and other fallen angels being described in other parts of this
work, a few words upon the much-slandered Satan will be sufficient. That
which the student will do well to remember is that, with every people
except the Christian nations, the Devil is to this day no worse an
entity than the opposite aspect in the dual nature of the so-called
Creator. This is only natural. One cannot claim God as the synthesis of
the whole Universe, as Omnipresent and Omniscient and Infinite, and then
divorce him from evil. As there is far more evil than good in the world,
it follows on logical grounds that either God must include evil, or
stand as the direct cause of it, or else surrender his claims to
absoluteness. The ancients understood this so well that their
philosophers -- now followed by the Kabalists -- defined evil as the
lining of God or Good: *Demon est Deus inversus*, being a very old
adage. Indeed, evil is but an antagonizing blind force in nature; it is
*reaction*, *opposition*, and *contrast*, -- evil for some, good for
others. There is no *malum in se:* only the shadow of light, without
which light could have no existence, even in our perceptions. If evil
disappeared, good would disappear along with it from Earth. The "Old
Dragon" was pure spirit before he became matter, *passive* before he
became *active.* In the Syro-Chaldean magic both Ophis and Ophiomorphos
are joined in the Zodiac, at the sign of the Androgyne *Virgo-Scorpio.*
Before its fall on earth the "Serpent" was *Ophis-Christos*, and after
its fall it became Ophiomorphos-**C**HRESTOS. Everywhere the
speculations of the Kabalists treat of Evil as a FORCE, which is
antagonistic, but at the same time essential, to Good, as giving it
vitality and existence, which it could never have otherwise. There would
be no *life* possible (in the *Mayavic* sense) without *Death*, nor
regeneration and reconstruction without destruction. Plants would perish
in eternal sunlight, and so would man, who would become an automaton
without the exercise of his free will and aspirations

------------------------------------------------------------------------

###### \[\[Vol. 1, Page\]\] 414 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.

after that sunlight, which would lose its being and value for him had he
nothing but light. Good is infinite and eternal only in the eternally
concealed from us, and this is why we imagine it eternal. On the
manifested planes, one equilibrates the other. Few are those theists and
believers in a personal God, who do not make of Satan the shadow of God;
or who, confounding both, do not believe they have a right to pray to
that idol asking its help and protection for the exercise and impunity
of their evil and cruel deeds. "Lead us not into Temptation" is
addressed daily to "our Father, which art in Heaven," and not to the
Devil, by millions of human Christian hearts. They do so, repeating the
very words put in the mouth of their Saviour, and do not give one
thought to the fact that their meaning is contradicted point blank by
James "the brother of the Lord." "Let no man say when he is tempted, I
am tempted of God: for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth
he any man." -- (The Gen. Ep. of James, i, 13). Why, then, say that it
is the Devil who tempts us, when the Church teaches us *on the authority
of Christ* that it is God who does so? Open any pious volume in which
the word "temptation" is defined in its theological sense, and forthwith
you find two definitions: (1) "Those afflictions and troubles *whereby
God tries his people;*" (2) Those means and enticements which the Devil
makes use of to *ensnare* and allure mankind. (St. James i., 2, 12, and
Mat. vi., 13.) If accepted literally, the two teachings of Christ and
James contradict each other, and what dogma can reconcile the two if the
occult meaning is rejected?

Between the alternative allurements, wise will be that philosopher who
will be able to decide where God disappears to make room for the Devil!
Therefore when we read that "the Devil is a liar and the father of it,"
*i.e.*, INCARNATE LIE, and are told in the same breath that Satan -- the
Devil -- was a son of God and the most beautiful of his archangels,
rather than believe that Father and Son are a gigantic, personified and
eternal LIE, we prefer to turn to Pantheism and to Pagan philosophy for
information.

Once that the key to Genesis is in our hands, it is the scientific and
symbolical Kabala which unveils the secret. The great Serpent of the
Garden of Eden and the "Lord God" are identical, and so are Jehovah and
Cain ONE -- that Cain who is referred to in theology as the "murderer"
and the LIAR to God! Jehovah tempts the King of Israel to number the
people, and Satan tempts him to do the same in another place. Jehovah
turns into the fiery serpents to bite those he is displeased with; and
Jehovah informs the brazen serpent that heals them.

These short, and seemingly contradictory, statements in the Old
Testament (contradictory because the two Powers are separated instead of
being regarded as the two faces of one and the same thing) are the

------------------------------------------------------------------------

###### \[\[Vol. 1, Page\]\] 415 THEOLOGICAL ETYMOLOGIES.

echoes -- distorted out of recognition by exotericism and theology -- of
the universal and philosophical dogmas in nature, so well understood by
the primitive Sages. We find the same groundwork in several
personifications in the Puranas, only far more ample and philosophically
suggestive.

Thus Pulastya, a "Son of God" -- one of the first progeny -- is made the
progenitor of Demons, the Rakshasas, the tempters and the Devourers of
men. *Pisacha* (female Demon) is a daughter of Daksha, a "Son of God"
too, and a God, and the mother of all the Pisachas (*Padma Purana*)*.*
The Demons, so called in the Puranas, are very extraordinary devils when
judged from the standpoint of European and orthodox views about these
creatures, since all of them -- Danavas, Daityas, Pisachas, and the
Rakshasas -- are represented as extremely pious, following the precepts
of the Vedas, some of them even being great Yogis. But they oppose the
clergy and Ritualism, sacrifices and forms -- just what the full-blown
Yogins do to this day in India -- and are no less respected for it,
though they are allowed to follow neither caste nor ritual; hence all
those Puranic giants and Titans are called Devils. The Missionaries,
ever on the watch to show, if they can, the Hindu traditions no better
than *a reflection* of the Jewish Bible, have evolved a whole romance on
the alleged identity of Pulastya with Cain, and of the Rakshasas with
the Cainites, "the accursed," the cause of the *Noachian* Deluge. (See
the work of Abbe Gorresio, who "etymologises" Pulastya's name as meaning
the "rejected," hence Cain, if you please). Pulastya dwells in *Kedara*,
he says, which means a "dug-up place," a *mine*, and Cain is shown in
tradition and the Bible as the first worker in metals and a miner
thereof!

While it is very probable that the *Gibborim* (the giants) of the Bible
are the Rakshasas of the Hindus, it is still more certain that both are
Atlanteans, and belong to the submerged races. However it may be, no
Satan could be more persistent in slandering his enemy, or more spiteful
in his hatred, than the Christian theologians are in cursing him as the
father of every evil. Compare their vituperations and opinions given
about the Devil with the philosophical views of the Puranic sages and
their Christ-like mansuetude. When Parasara, whose father was devoured
by a Rakshasa, was preparing himself to destroy (magically) the whole
race, his grandsire, Vasishta, says a few extremely suggestive words to
him. He shows the irate Sage, on his own confession, that there is Evil
and *Karma*, but no "evil spirits." "Let thy wrath be appeased," he
says. "The Rakshasas are not culpable; thy father's death *was the work
of Karma.* Anger is the passion of fools; it becometh not a wise man.
*By whom*, *it may be asked*, *is any one killed?* Every man *reaps the
consequences of his own acts.* Anger, my son, is the destruction of

all that man obtains . . . and prevents the attainment of emancipation.
The sages shun wrath. Be not thou, my child, subject to its influence.
Let not those *unoffending* spirits of darkness be consumed; let thy
sacrifice cease. Mercy is the might of the righteous" (*Vishnu Purana*,
Book i., ch. i.). Thus, every such "sacrifice" or prayer to God for help
is *no better than an act of black magic.* That which Parasara prayed
for, was the destruction of the Spirits of Darkness, for his personal
revenge. He is called a *Pagan*, and the Christians have doomed him as
such, to eternal hell. Yet, in what respect is the prayer of sovereigns
and generals, who pray before every battle for the destruction of their
enemy, any better? Such a prayer is in every case *black magic* of the
worst kind, concealed like a demon "Mr. Hyde" under a sanctimonious "Dr.
Jekyll."

In human nature, evil denotes only the polarity of matter and Spirit, a
struggle for life between the two manifested Principles in Space and
Time, which principles are one *per se*, inasmuch they are rooted in the
Absolute. In Kosmos, the equilibrium must be preserved. The operations
of the two contraries produce harmony, like the centripetal and
centrifugal forces, which are necessary to each other -- mutually
inter-dependent -- "in order that both should live." If one is arrested,
the action of the other will become immediately self-destructive.

Since the personification called Satan has been amply analyzed from its
triple aspect -- in the Old Testament, Christian theology and the
ancient Gentile attitude of thought -- those who would learn more of it
are referred to Vol. II. of **I**SIS **U**NVEILED, chap. x. See also
several sections in Book II., Part II. of this work. The present subject
is touched upon and fresh explanations attempted for a very good reason.
Before we can approach the evolution of physical and *divine* man, we
have first to master the idea of cyclic evolution, to acquaint ourselves
with the philosophies and beliefs of the four races which preceded our
present race, to learn what were the ideas of those Titans and giants --
giants, verily, mentally as well as physically. The whole of antiquity
was imbued with that philosophy which teaches the involution of spirit
into matter, the progressive, downward cyclic descent, or active,
self-conscious evolution. The Alexandrian Gnostics have sufficiently
divulged the secret of initiations, and their records are full of "the
sliding down of *AEons*" in their double qualification of Angelic Beings
and Periods: the one the natural evolution of the other. On the other
hand, Oriental traditions on both sides of the "black water" -- the
oceans that separate the two *Easts* -- are as full of allegories about
the downfall of Pleroma, of that of the gods and Devas. One and all,
they allegorized and explained the **F**ALL as *the*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

###### \[\[Vol. 1, Page\]\] 417 THE ANGELS SLANDERED.

*desire to learn and acquire knowledge* -- to KNOW. This is the natural
sequence of mental evolution, the spiritual becoming transmuted into the
material or physical. The same law of descent into materiality and
re-ascent into spirituality asserted itself during the Christian era,
the reaction having stopped only just now, in our own special
*sub-race.*

That which, perhaps ten millenniums ago, was allegorized in *Pymander*
in a triune character of interpretation, meant as a record of an
astronomical, anthropological, and even alchemical fact, namely, the
allegory of the seven rectors breaking through the seven circles of
fire, was dwarfed into one material and anthropomorphic interpretation
-- the rebellion and *Fall of the Angels.* The multivocal, profoundly
philosophical narrative, under its poetical form of the "Marriage of
Heaven with Earth," the love of nature for Divine form and the "Heavenly
man," enraptured with his own beauty mirrored in nature -- *i.e.*,
Spirit attracted into matter -- has now become, under theological
handling: "the seven Rectors disobeying Jehovah, self admiration
generating Satanic Pride, followed by their **F**ALL, Jehovah permitting
no worship to be lost save upon himself." In short, the beautiful
Planet-Angels, the glorious cyclic aeons of the ancients, became
henceforward synthesized in their most orthodox shape in Samael, the
chief of the Demons in the Talmud, "That great serpent with *twelve
wings* that draws down after himself, in his Fall, the solar system, or
the Titans." But *Schemal*, the *alter ego* and the Sabean type of
Samael, meant, in his philosophical and esoteric aspect, the "year" in
its astrological evil aspect, its twelve months or wings of unavoidable
evils, in nature; and in esoteric theogony (see Chwolson in
**N**ABATHEAN **A**GRICULTURE, Vol. II., p. 217), both Schemal and
Samael represented a particular divinity. With the Kabalists they are
"the Spirit of the Earth," the personal god that governs it, identical
*de facto* with Jehovah. For the Talmudists admit themselves that
**S**AMAEL is a god-name of one of the seven Elohim. The Kabalists,
moreover, show the two, Schemal and Samael, as a symbolical form of
Saturn, **C**HRONOS, the twelve wings standing for the 12 months, and
the symbol in its collectivity representing *a racial cycle.* Jehovah
and Saturn are also glyphically identical.

This leads in its turn to a very curious deduction from a Roman Catholic
dogma. Many renowned writers belonging to the Latin Church admit that a
difference exists, and should be made, between the Uranian Titans, the
antediluvian giants (also Titans), and those post-diluvian giants in
whom they (the Roman Catholics) *will* see the descendants of the
mythical Ham. In clearer words, there is a difference to be made between
the Cosmic, *primordial* opposing Forces -- guided by cyclic law -- the
Atlantean human giants, and the post-diluvian great adepts, whether

of the *right* or the *left* hand. At the same time they show that
Michael, "the *generalissimos* of the fighting Celestial Host, the
*bodyguard of Jehovah*," as it would seem (see de Mirville) is also a
Titan, only with the adjective of "divine" before the cognomen. Thus
those "Uranides" who are called everywhere "divine Titans," and who,
having rebelled against Kronos (Saturn), are therefore also shown to be
the enemies of Samael (an Elohim, also and synonymous with Jehovah in
his collectivity), are identical with Michael and his host. In short,
the *roles* are reversed, all the combatants are confused, and no
student is able to distinguish clearly which is which. Esoteric
explanation may, however, bring some order into this confusion, in which
Jehovah becomes Saturn, and Michael and his army, Satan and the
rebellious angels, owing to the indiscreet endeavours of the too
faithful zealots to see in every pagan god a devil. The true meaning is
far more philosophical, and the legend of the first "Fall" (of the
angels) assumes a scientific colouring when correctly understood.

Kronos stands for endless (hence immovable) Duration, without beginning,
without an end, beyond divided Time and beyond Space. Those "Angels,"
genii, or Devas, who were born *to act in space and time*, *i.e.*, to
break through the *seven circles of the superspiritual* planes into the
phenomenal, or circumscribed, super-terrestrial regions, are said
allegorically to *have rebelled* against Kronos and fought the (then)
one living and highest God. In his turn, when Kronos is represented as
mutilating Uranus, his father, the meaning of this mutilation is very
simple: Absolute Time is made to become the finite and the conditioned;
a portion is robbed from the whole, thus showing that Saturn, the father
of the gods, has been transformed from *Eternal Duration* into a limited
Period. Chronos cuts down with his scythe even the longest and (to us)
seemingly endless cycles, yet, for all that, limited in Eternity, and
puts down with the same scythe the mightiest rebels. Aye, not one will
escape the scythe of Time! Praise the god or gods, or flout, one or
both, and that scythe will not be made to tremble one millionth of a
second in its ascending or descending course.

The Titans of Hesiod's *Theogony* were copied in Greece from the *Suras*
and *Asuras* of India. These Hesiodic Titans, the *Uranides*, numbered
once upon a time as only six, have been recently discovered to be
*seven* -- the seventh being called Phoreg -- in an old fragment
relating to the Greek myth. Thus their identity with the Seven rectors
is fully demonstrated. The origin of the "War in Heaven" and the
**F**ALL has, in our mind, to be traced unavoidably to India, and
perhaps far earlier than the Puranic accounts thereof. For **T**ARAMAYA
was in a later age, and there are three accounts, each of a distinct
war, to be traced in almost every Cosmogony.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

###### \[\[Vol. 1, Page\]\] 419 THE WAR OF THE GODS.

The first war happened in the night of time, between the gods the
(A)-*suras*, and lasted for the period of one "divine year."\* On this
occasion the deities were defeated by the Daityas, under the leadership
of Hrada. After that, owing to a device of Vishnu, to whom the conquered
gods applied for help, the latter defeated the Asuras. In the Vishnu
Purana no interval is found between the two wars. In the Esoteric
Doctrine, one war takes place before the building of the Solar system;
another, on earth, at the "creation" of man; and a third "war" is
mentioned as taking place at the close of the 4th Race, between its
adepts and those of the 5th Race, *i.e.*, between the Initiates of the
"Sacred Island" and the Sorcerers of Atlantis. We shall notice the first
contest, as recounted by Parasara, while trying to separate the two
accounts, purposely blended together. It is there stated that as the
Daityas and Asuras were engaged in the duties of their respective orders
(*Varna*) and followed the paths prescribed by holy writ, practising
also religious penance (a queer employment for *demons* if they are
*identical with our devils*, as it is claimed) -- it was impossible for
the gods to destroy them. The prayers addressed by the gods to Vishnu
are curious as showing the ideas involved in an anthropomorphic deity.
Having, after their defeat, "fled to the Northern shore of the Milky
Ocean (Atlantic Ocean),\*\* the discomfited gods address many
supplications "to the first

\* One "Day of Brahma" lasting 4,320,000,000 years -- multiply this by
365! The Asuras here (no-gods, but demons) are still *Suras*, gods
higher in hierarchy than such secondary gods as are not even mentioned
in the Vedas. The duration of the war shows its significance, and that
they are only the personified Cosmic powers. It is evidently for
sectarian purposes and out of *odium theologicum* that the illusive form
assumed by Vishnu *Mayamoha*, was attributed in later rearrangements of
old texts to Buddha and the Daityas, in the *Vishnu Purana*, unless it
was a fancy of Wilson himself. He also fancied he found an allusion to
Buddhism in Bhagavatgita, whereas, as proved by K. T. Telang, he had
only confused the Buddhists and the older Charvaka materialists. The
version exists nowhere in other Puranas if the inference does, as
Professor Wilson claims, in the "Vishnu Purana"; the translation of
which, especially of Book iii., ch. xviii., where the reverend
Orientalist arbitrarily introduces Buddha, and shows him teaching
Buddhism to Daityas -- led to another "great war" between himself and
Col. Vans Kennedy. The latter charged him publicly with wilfully
distorting Puranic texts. "I affirm," wrote the Colonel at Bombay, in
1840, "that the Puranas do not contain what Professor Wilson has stated
is contained in them . . . until such passages are produced I may be
allowed to repeat my former conclusions, that Professor Wilson's
opinion, that the Puranas as now extant are compilations made between
the eighth and seventeenth centuries (**A.D**.!) rests solely *on
gratuitous assumptions and unfounded assertions*, and that his reasoning
in support of it is either futile, fallacious, contradictory, or
improbable." (See *Vishnu Purana*, trans. by Wilson, edit. by Fitzedward
Hall, Vol. V., Appendix.)

continents, seas and rivers are mentioned in connection with it.

of beings, the divine Vishnu," and among others this one: "Glory to
thee, who art one with the Saints, whose perfect nature is ever blessed.
. . . Glory to thee, *who art one with the Serpent-race*,
*double-tongued*, *impetuous*, *cruel*, *insatiate of enjoyment* and
abounding with wealth. . . . Glory to thee, . . . . O Lord, *who hast
neither colour nor extension*, nor size (*ghana*), *nor any predicable
qualities*, and whose essence (*rupa*), purest of the pure is
appreciable only by holy *Paramarshi* (greatest of sages or Rishis). We
bow to thee, in the nature of Brahma uncreated, undecaying (*avyaya*),
who *art in our bodies* and *in all other bodies*, *and in all living
creatures*, and beside whom nothing exists. We glorify that Vasudeva,
the lord of all, who is without soil, the seed of all things, exempt
from dissolution, unborn, eternal; being in essence *Paramapadatmavat*
(beyond the condition of spirit) and in essence and substance (*rupa*),
the whole of this (Universe)." (Book III., ch. xvii., *Vish. Purana.*)

The above is quoted as an illustration of the vast field offered by the
Puranas to adverse and erroneous criticism, by every European bigot who
forms an estimate of an alien religion on mere external evidence. Any
man accustomed to subject what he reads to thoughtful analysis, will see
at a glance the incongruity of addressing the accepted "Unknowable," the
formless, and attributeless **A**BSOLUTE, such as the Vedantins define
**B**RAHMA, as being "one with the serpent-race, double-tongued, cruel
and insatiable," thus associating the abstract with the concrete, and
bestowing adjectives on that which is freed from any limitations, and
conditionless. Even Dr. Wilson, who, after living surrounded by Brahmins
and Pundits in India for so many years, ought to have known better --
even that scholar lost no opportunity to criticize the Hindu Scriptures
on this account. Thus, he exclaims: --\*

"The Puranas constantly teach incompatible doctrines! According to this
passage, the Supreme being is not the inert cause of creation only, but
exercises the functions of an active providence. The Commentator quotes
a text of the Veda in support of this view: 'Universal Soul entering
into men, governs their conduct.' Incongruities, however, are as
frequent in the Vedas as in the Puranas. . . . ."

Less frequent, in sober truth, than in the Mosaic Bible. But prejudice
is great in the hearts of our Orientalists -- especially in those of
"reverend" scholars. **U**NIVERSAL **S**OUL is *not* the inert Cause of
Creation or (Para) Brahma, but simply that which we call the sixth
principle of *intellectual* Kosmos, on the manifested plane of being. It
is Mahat, or *Mahabuddhi*, the great Soul, the vehicle of Spirit, the
first primeval reflection of the formless **C**AUSE, and that which is
even *beyond* **S**PIRIT.

###### \[\[Vol. 1, Page\]\] 421 THE DECEPTION OF THE GODS.

So much for Professor Wilson's uncalled-for fling. As for the apparently
incongruous appeal to Vishnu by the defeated gods, the explanation is
there, in the text of Vishnu Purana, if Orientalists would only notice
it.\* There is Vishnu, as Brahma, and Vishnu *in his two aspects*,
philosophy teaches. There is but one Brahma, "essentially *prakriti* and
*Spirit*," &c.

Therefore, it is not Vishnu -- "the inert cause of creation" -- which
exercised the functions of an *active* Providence, but the Universal
Soul, that which E. Levi calls *Astral Light* in its material aspect.
And this "Soul" is, in its dual aspect of spirit and matter, the true
anthropomorphic God of the Theists; as this God is a *personification*
of that Universal Creative Agent, pure and impure both, owing to its
manifested condition and differentiation in this Mayavic World -- *God*
and *Devil* -- truly. But Dr. Wilson failed to see how Vishnu, in this
character, closely resembles the Lord God of Israel, "especially in his
policy of deception, temptation, and cunning."

In the Vishnu Purana this is made as plain as can be. For it is said
there, that "at the conclusion of their prayers (*stotra*) the gods
beheld the Sovereign Deity Hari (Vishnu) armed with the conch, the
discus, and the mace, *riding on Garuda.* ." Now "Garuda" is the
manvantaric *cycle*, as will be shown in its place. Vishnu, therefore,
is the deity *in space and time*; the peculiar God of the Vaishnavas (a
*tribal* or *racial God*, as they are called in esoteric philosophy):
*i.e.*, one of the many Dhyanis or Gods, or Elohim, one of whom was
generally chosen for some special reasons by a nation or a tribe, and
thus became gradually a "God *above all* Gods" (2 Chronicles ii. 5,) the
"highest God" as Jehovah, Osiris, Bel, or any other of the *Seven*
Regents.

"The tree is known by its fruit," -- the nature of a God by his actions.
The latter, we have either to judge by the dead-letter narratives, or to
accept allegorically. If we compare the two -- Vishnu, as the defender
and champion of the defeated gods; and Jehovah, the defender and
champion of the "chosen" people, so called by antiphrasis, no doubt, as
it is the Jews who had *chosen* that "jealous" God -- we shall find that
both use deceit and cunning. They do so on the principle of "the end
justifying the means," in order to have the best of their

\* This ignorance is truly and beautifully expressed in the praise of
the Yogins to Brahma, "the upholder of the earth" (in Book I., chap. iv.
of V. P.), when they say, "Those who have not practised devotion
conceive erroneously of the nature of the world. The ignorant who do not
perceive that this Universe is of the nature of wisdom, and judge of it
as an object of perception only, are lost in the ocean of spiritual
ignorance. But they who know true wisdom, and whose minds are pure,
behold this whole world *as one with divine knowledge*, as one with
thee, O God! Be favourable, O universal Spirit!"

respective opponents and foes -- the demons. Thus while (according to
the Kabalists) Jehovah assumes the shape of the tempting Serpent in the
Garden of Eden; sends Satan with a special mission to tempt Job; and
harasses and wearies Pharaoh with Sarai, Abraham's wife, and "*hardens*"
his heart against Moses, lest there should be no opportunity for
*plaguing* his victims "with great plagues" (*Genesis* xii., *Exodus*)
-- Vishnu is made in *his* Purana to resort to a trick no less unworthy
of any respectable god.

Finally the Daityas were seduced by the wily talk of *Mahamoha*, as Eve
was seduced by the advice of the Serpent. They became apostates to the
Vedas. As Dr. Muir translates the passage: --

> "The great Deceiver, practising illusion, next beguiled other Daityas,

Whatever may be thought of Hindus, no enemy of theirs can regard them as
fools. A people whose holy men and sages have left to the world the
greatest and most sublime philosophies that ever emanated from the minds
of men, must have known the difference between right and wrong. Even a
savage can discern white from black, good from bad, and deceit from
sincerity and truthfulness. Those who had narrated this event in the
biography of their god, must have seen that in this case it was that God
who was the arch-Deceiver, and the Daityas, who "never transgressed the
precepts of the Vedas," who had the sunny side in the transaction, and
who were the true "Gods." Thence there must have been, and *there is* a
secret meaning hidden under this allegory. In no class of Society, in no
nation, are deceit and craft considered as Divine virtues -- except
perhaps in the clerical classes of theologians and modern Jesuitism.

The Vishnu Purana,\* like all other works of this kind, has passed at a
later period into the hands of the temple-Brahmins, and the old **MSS**.
have, no doubt, been once more tampered with by sectarians. But there
was a time when the Puranas were esoteric works, and so they are still
for the Initiates who can read them with the key that is in their
possession.

Whether the Brahmin Initiates will ever give out the full meaning of
these allegories, is a question with which the writer is not concerned.
The present object is to show that, while honouring the *creative
Powers* in their multiple forms, no philosopher could, or ever has,
accepted the allegory for the true Spirit, except, perhaps, some
philosophers belonging to the present "superior and civilized" Christian
races. For, as shown, Jehovah is not one whit the superior of Vishnu on
the plane of ethics. This is why the Occultists and even some Kabalists,
whether they regard or not those creative Forces *as living and
conscious Entities* -- and one does not see why they should not be so
accepted -- will never confuse the **C**AUSE with the effect, and accept
the Spirit of the Earth for Parabrahm or Ain-Soph. At all events they
know well the true nature of what was called Father-AEther by the
Greeks, Jupiter-Titan, etc., etc. They know that the soul of the
**A**STRAL **L**IGHT is divine, and

its body (the light-waves on the lower planes) infernal. This Light is
symbolized by the "Magic Head" in the *Zohar*, the double Face on the
double Pyramid: the black pyramid rising against a pure white ground,
with *a white head and face within its black triangle;* the white
pyramid, inverted -- the reflection of the first in the dark waters,
showing the *black reflection of the white face*. . . . .

This is the "Astral Light," or **D**EMON EST **D**EUS **I**NVERSUS.
