##### (SECRET DOCTRINE.) § I. SYMBOLISM AND IDEOGRAPHS.

> "A symbol is ever, to him who has eyes for it, some dimmer or clearer
> revelation of the God-like. Through all there glimmers something of a
> divine idea; nay, the highest ensign that men ever met and embraced
> under the cross itself, had no meaning, save an accidental extrinsic
> one." **C**ARLYLE.

**T**HE study of the hidden meaning in every religious and profane
legend, of whatsoever nation, large or small -- pre-eminently the
traditions of the East -- has occupied the greater portion of the
present writer's life. She is one of those who feel convinced that no
mythological story, no traditional event in the folk-lore of a people
has ever been, at any time, pure fiction, but that every one of such
narratives has an actual, historical lining to it. In this the writer
disagrees with those symbologists, however great their reputation, who
find in every myth nothing save additional proofs of the superstitious
bent of mind of the ancients, and believe that all mythologies sprung
from and are built upon *solar myths.* Such superficial thinkers were
admirably disposed of by Mr. Gerald Massey, the poet and Egyptologist,
in a lecture on "Luniolatry, Ancient and Modern." His pointed criticism
is worthy of reproduction in this part of this work, as it echoes so
well our own feelings, expressed openly so far back as 1875, when "Isis
Unveiled" was written.

This is a very correct exposition of the lunar-mythos from its
astronomical aspect. Selenography, however, is the least esoteric of the
divisions of lunar Symbology. To master thoroughly -- if one is
permitted to coin a new word -- *Selenognosis*, one must become
proficient in more than its astronomical meaning. The moon (*vide* §
VII. *Deus Lunus*) is intimately related to the Earth, as shown in
Stanza VI. of Book I., and is more directly concerned with all the
mysteries of our globe than is even Venus-Lucifer, the occult sister and
*alter-ego* of the Earth.

The untiring researches of Western, and especially German, symbologists,
during the last and the present centuries, have brought every Occultist
and most unprejudiced persons to see that without the help of symbology
(with its seven departments, of which the moderns know nothing) no
ancient Scripture can ever be correctly understood. Symbology must be
studied from every one of its aspects, for each nation had its own
peculiar methods of expression. In short, no Egyptian papyrus, no Indian
tolla, no Assyrian tile, or Hebrew scroll, should be read and accepted
*literally.*

This every scholar now knows. The able lectures of Mr. G. Massey alone
are sufficient in themselves to convince any *fair-minded* Christian
that to accept the dead-letter of the Bible is equivalent to falling
into a grosser error and superstition than any hitherto evolved by the
brain of the savage South Sea Islander. But the point to which even the
most truth-loving and truth-searching Orientalists -- whether Aryanists
or Egyptologists -- seem to remain blind, is the fact that every symbol
in papyrus or *olla* is a many-faced diamond, each of whose facets not
merely bears several interpretations, but relates likewise to several
sciences. This is instanced in the just quoted interpretation of the
moon symbolized by the cat -- an example of sidero-terrestrial imagery;
the moon bearing many other meanings besides this with other nations.

As a learned Mason and Theosophist, the late Mr. Kenneth Mackenzie, has
shown in his *Royal Masonic Cyclopaedia*, there is a great difference
between *emblem* and *symbol.* The former "comprises a larger series of
thoughts than a symbol, which may be said rather to illustrate some
single special idea." Hence, the symbols (say lunar, or solar) of
several countries, each illustrating such a special idea, or series of
ideas, form collectively an esoteric emblem. The latter is "a concrete
visible

picture or sign representing principles, or a series of principles,
*recognizable by those who have received certain instructions*"
(initiates). To put it still plainer, an emblem is *usually a series of
graphic pictures* viewed and explained allegorically, and unfolding an
idea in panoramic views, one after the other. Thus the Puranas are
written emblems. So are the Mosaic and Christian Testaments, or the
Bible, and all other exoteric Scriptures. As the same authority shows:
--

> "All esoteric Societies have made use of emblems and symbols, such as
> the Pythagorean Society, the Eleusinian, the Hermetic Brethren of
> Egypt, the Rosicrucians, and the Freemasons. Many of these emblems it
> is not proper to divulge to the general eye, and *a very minute
> difference may make the emblem or symbol* differ widely in its
> meaning. The magical sigillae, being founded on certain principles of
> numbers, partake of this character, and although monstrous or
> ridiculous in the eyes of the uninstructed, convey a whole body of
> doctrine to those who have been trained to recognise them."

The above enumerated societies are all comparatively modern, none dating
back earlier than the middle ages. How much more proper, then, that the
students of the oldest Archaic School should be careful not to divulge
secrets of far more importance to humanity (in the sense of being
dangerous in the hands of the latter) than any of the so-called "Masonic
Secrets," which have now become, as the French say, those of
"Polichinelle!" But this restriction can apply only to the psychological
or rather psycho-physiological and Cosmical significance of symbol and
emblem, and even to that only partially. An adept must refuse to impart
the conditions and means that lead to a correlation of elements, whether
psychic or physical, that may produce a hurtful result as well as a
beneficent one. But he is ever ready to impart to the earnest student
the secret of the ancient thought in anything that regards history
concealed under mythological symbolism, and thus to furnish a few more
land-marks towards a retrospective view of the past, as containing
useful information with regard to the origin of man, the evolution of
the races and geognosy; yet it is the crying complaint of to-day, not
only among theosophists, but also among the few profane interested in
the subject. "Why do not the adepts reveal that which they know?" To
this, one might answer, "Why should they, since one knows beforehand
that no man of science will accept, even as an hypothesis, let alone as
a theory or axiom, the facts imparted. Have you so much as accepted or
believed in the A B C of the Occult philosophy contained in the
*Theosophist*, "Esoteric Buddhism," and other works and periodicals? Has
not even the little which was given, been ridiculed and derided, and
made to face the "animal" and "ape theory" of Huxley -- Haeckel, on one
hand, and the rib of Adam and the apple on the other? Notwithstanding
such an unenviable prospect, a mass of facts is given in the present
work. And now the origin of man, the evolution of the globe and

the races, human and animal, are as fully treated here as the writer is
able to treat them.

The proofs brought forward in corroboration of the old teachings are
scattered widely throughout the old scriptures of ancient civilizations.
The Puranas, the Zendavesta, and the old classics are full of them; but
no one has ever gone to the trouble of collecting and collating together
those facts. The reason for this is, that all such events were recorded
symbolically; and that the best scholars, the most acute minds, among
our Aryanists and Egyptologists, have been too often darkened by one or
another preconception; still oftener, by one-sided views of the secret
meaning. Yet even a parable is a spoken symbol: a fiction or a fable, as
some think; an allegorical representation, we say, of life-realities,
events, and facts. And, as a moral was ever drawn from a parable, that
moral being an actual truth and fact in human life, so an historical,
real event was deduced -- by those versed in the hieratic sciences --
from certain emblems and symbols recorded in the ancient archives of the
temples. The religious and esoteric history of every nation was embedded
in symbols; it was never expressed in so many words. All the thoughts
and emotions, all the learning and knowledge, revealed and acquired, of
the early races, found their pictorial expression in allegory and
parable. Why? Because *the spoken word has a potency unknown to*,
*unsuspected and disbelieved in*, by the modern "sages." Because sound
and rhythm are closely related to the four Elements of the Ancients; and
because such or another vibration in the air is sure to awaken
corresponding powers, union with which produces good or bad results, as
the case may be. No student was ever allowed to recite historical,
religious, or any real events in so many unmistakable words, lest the
powers connected with the event should be once more attracted. Such
events were narrated only during the Initiation, and every student had
to record them in corresponding symbols, drawn out of his own mind and
examined later by his master, before they were finally accepted. Thus
was created in time the Chinese Alphabet, as, before that, the hieratic
symbols were fixed upon in old Egypt. In the Chinese language, the
alphabet of which may be read in any language,\* and which is only a
little less ancient than the Egyptian alphabet of Thoth, every word has
its corresponding symbol conveying the word needed in a pictorial form.
The language possesses many thousands of such symbol letters, or
logograms, each meaning a whole word; for letters proper, or an
alphabet, do not exist in the Chinese language any more than they did in
the Egyptian till a far later period.

\* Thus, a Japanese who does not understand one word of Chinese, meeting
with a Chinaman who has never heard the language of the former, will
communicate in writing with him, and they will understand each other
perfectly -- because the writing is symbolical.

The explanation of the chief symbols and emblems is now attempted, as
Book II., which treats of Anthropogenesis, would be most difficult to
understand without a preparatory acquaintance with the metaphysical
symbols at least.

Nor would it be just to enter upon an esoteric reading of symbolism
without giving due honour to one who has rendered it the greatest
service in this century, by discovering the chief key to ancient Hebrew
symbology, interwoven strongly with metrology, one of the keys to the
once universal mystery language. Mr. Ralston Skinner, of Cincinnati, the
author of "The Hebrew-Egyptian Mystery and the Source of Measures" has
our thanks. A mystic and a Kabalist by nature, he has laboured for many
years in this direction, and his efforts were certainly crowned with
great success. In his own words: --

> "The writer is quite certain that there was an ancient language which

"Divine origin" does not mean here a revelation from an anthropomorphic
god on a mount amidst thunder and lightning; but, as we understand it, a
language and a system of science imparted to the early mankind by a more
advanced *mankind*, so much higher as to be *divine* in the sight of
that infant humanity. By a "mankind," in short, from other spheres; an
idea which contains nothing supernatural in it, but the acceptance or
rejection of which depends upon the degree of conceit and arrogance in
the mind of him to whom it is stated. For, if the professors of modern
knowledge would only confess that, though they know nothing of the
future of the disembodied man -- or rather will accept nothing -- yet
this future may be pregnant with surprises and unexpected revelations to
them, once their Egos are rid of their gross bodies -- then
materialistic unbelief would have fewer chances than it has. Who of them
knows, or can tell, what may happen when once the life cycle of this
globe is run down and our mother earth herself falls into her last
sleep? Who is bold enough to say that the *divine Egos* of our mankind
-- at least the elect out of the multitudes passing on to other spheres
-- *will not become in their turn* the "divine" instructors of a new
mankind generated by them on a new globe, called to life and activity by
the disembodied "principles" of our Earth? (See Stanza VI., Book I.,
Part 1.) All this may have been the experience of the **P**AST, and
these strange records lie embedded in the "Mystery language" of the
prehistoric ages, the language now called **S**YMBOLISM.
