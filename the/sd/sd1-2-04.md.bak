#### ยง IV. CHAOS -- THEOS -- KOSMOS.

**T**HESE three are the containment of Space; or, as a learned Kabalist
has defined it, "Space, the all containing uncontained, is the primary
embodiment of simply Unity. . . . boundless extension."\* But, he asks
again, "boundless extension of what?" -- and makes the correct reply --
"The *unknown container of all*, *the Unknown FIRST CAUSE.*" This is a
most correct definition and answer, most esoteric and true, from every
aspect of occult teaching.

*SPACE***,** which, in their ignorance and iconoclastic tendency to
destroy every philosophic idea of old, the modern wiseacres have
proclaimed "an abstract idea" and a *void*, is, in reality, the
container and *the body of the Universe* with its seven principles. It
is a body of limitless extent, whose *PRINCIPLES*, in Occult phraseology
-- each being in its turn a septenary -- manifest in our phenomenal
world only the grossest fabric of *their sub-divisions.* "No one has
ever seen the Elements in their fulness," the Doctrine teaches. We have
to search for our Wisdom in the original expressions of the primeval
people and in their synonyms. Even the latest of them -- the Jews --
show in their Kabalistic teachings this idea, *e.g*., the seven-headed
Serpent of Space, called "the great Sea." "In the beginning, the *Alhim*
created the heavens and the earth; the 6 (Sephiroth). . . . They created
six, and on these all things are based. And those (six) depend upon *the
seven forms of the cranium* up to Dignity of all Dignities (*Siphrah
Dzenioota*, i, ยง 16), see part ii., vol. ii. "Ancient Divisions and the
Mystic Numbers."

Now *Wind*, *Air and Spirit* have ever been synonymous with every
nation. Pneuma (Spirit) and Anemos (the wind) with the Greeks,
*Spiritus* and *Ventus* with the Latins, were convertible terms even if
dissociated from the original idea of the breath of life. In the
"Forces" of Science we see but the *material effect of the spiritual
affect* of one or the other of the four primordial Elements, transmitted
to us by the 4th Race, as we shall transmit Ether (or rather the gross
subdivision of it) in its fulness to the Sixth Root Race. This is
explained in the text of this and the following Book.

"Chaos" is called *senseless* by the ancients, because it represented
and contained in itself (Chaos and Space being synonymous) all the
Elements in their rudimentary, undifferentiated State. They made of
Ether, the fifth element, the synthesis of the other four; for the
AEther of the Greek philosophers is not its dregs -- of which indeed
they knew more

than science does now -- which are rightly enough supposed to act as an
agent for many forces that manifest on Earth. Their AEther was the
*Akasa* of the Hindus; the Ether accepted in physics is but one of its
subdivisions, on our plane, -- the *Astral Light* of the Kabalists with
all its *evil* as well as good effects.

On account of the Essence of AEther, or the Unseen Space, being held
divine as the supposed veil of Deity, it was regarded as the medium
between this life and the next one. The ancients considered that when
the directing active "Intelligences" (the gods) retired from any portion
of Ether *in our Space* -- the four realms which they superintend --
then that particular place was left in the possession of evil, so called
by reason of the absence of the *Good* from it.

"*Nature abhors Vacuum*" said the Peripatetics, who comprehended
perhaps, though materialists in their way, why Democritus, with his
instructor Leucippus, taught that the first principles of all things
contained in the Universe were atoms and a *vacuum.* The latter means
simply *latent* Deity or force; which, before its first manifestation
when it became WILL -- communicating the first impulse to these atoms --
was the great *Nothingness*, Ain-Soph, or NO-THING; was, therefore, to
every sense, a Void -- or **C**HAOS.

That Chaos, however, became the "Soul of the World," according to Plato
and the Pythagoreans. According to Hindu teaching, Deity in the shape of
AEther (Akasa) pervades all things; and it was called there-

fore by the theurgists "the living fire," the "Spirit of Light," and
sometimes *Magnes.* It was the highest Deity itself which, according to
Plato, built the Universe in the geometrical form of the Dodecahedron;
and its "first begotten" was born of Chaos and Primordial Light (the
Central Sun). This "First-Born," however, was only the aggregate of the
Host of the "Builders," the first constructive Forces, who are called in
ancient Cosmogonies the *Ancients* (born of the Deep, or Chaos) and the
"First Point." He is the Tetragrammaton, so-called, at the head of the
Seven lower Sephiroth. This was the belief of the Chaldees. "These
Chaldeans," writes Philo, the Jew, speaking very flippantly of the first
instructors of his ancestors, "were of opinion that the Kosmos, *among
the things that exist* (?) is a single point, either being itself God
(Theos) or that in it is God, comprehending the soul of all things."
(See his "*Migration of Abraham*," 32*.*)

Chaos-Theos-Kosmos are but the three aspects of their synthesis --
SPACE. One can never hope to solve the mystery of this *Tetraktis by*
holding to the dead-letter even of the old philosophies, as now extant.
But, even in these CHAOS-THEOS-KOSMOS = SPACE, are identified in all
Eternity, as the One Unknown Space, the last word about which will,
perhaps, never be known before our seventh Round. Nevertheless, the
allegories and metaphysical symbols about the primeval and *perfect*
CUBE, are remarkable even in the exoteric Puranas.

There, also, Brahma is the *Theos*, evolving out of *Chaos*, or the
great "Deep," the waters, over which Spirit = SPACE, personified by
*ayana* -- the Spirit moving over the face of the future boundless
Kosmos -- is silently hovering, in the first hour of re-awakening. It is
also Vishnu, sleeping on Ananta-Sesha, the great Serpent of Eternity, of
which Western theology, ignorant of the Kabala, the only key that opens
the secrets of the Bible, has made -- the Devil. It is the first
*triangle* or the Pythagorean *triad*, the "God of the *three* Aspects,"
before it is transformed through its perfect quadrature of the infinite
Circle into the "four-faced Brahma."

"Of him who is and yet is not, from the not-being, Eternal Cause, is
born the Being-Purusha," says Manu, the legislator.

In *Isis Unveiled*, it is said that: --

> "In the Egyptian mythology, Kneph, the Eternal *Unrevealed* God, is
> represented by a snake emblem of Eternity encircling a water urn, with
> its head hovering over the waters, which it incubates with its breath.

"In the primordial state of the creation," says Polier's *Mythologie des
Indous*, "the rudimental universe, submerged in water, reposed in the
bosom of Vishnu. Sprung from this chaos and darkness, Brahma, the
architect of the world, poised on a lotus-leaf, floated (moved) upon the
waters, unable to discern anything but water and darkness." Perceiving
such a dismal state of things, Brahma soliloquises in consternation:
"Who am I? Whence came I?" Then he hears a voice:\*\* "Direct your
thoughts to Bhagavat." Brahma, rising from his natatory position, seats
himself upon the lotus in an attitude of contemplation, and reflects
upon the Eternal, who, pleased with this evidence of piety, disperses
the primeval darkness and opens his understanding. "After this Brahma
issues from the universal egg (infinite chaos) as *light*, for his
understanding is now opened, and he sets himself to work: he *moves* on
the eternal waters, with the spirit of God within himself; and in his
capacity of *mover* of the waters he is Vishnu, or *Narayana.*" This is

exoteric, of course, yet in its main idea as identical as possible with
the Egyptian cosmogony, which shows in its opening sentences Athtor,\*
or Mother Night (which represents illimitable darkness), as the primeval
element which covered the infinite abyss, animated by water and the
universal spirit of the Eternal, dwelling alone in Chaos. Similarly in
the Jewish Scriptures, the history of the creation opens with the spirit
of God and his creative emanation -- another Deity.\*\*

The Zohar teaches that it is the primordial elements -- the trinity of
Fire, Air and Water -- the four cardinal points, and all the Forces of
Nature, which form collectively the **V**OICE of the **W**ILL *Memrab*,
or the "Word," the Logos of the Absolute Silent ALL. "The indivisible
point, limitless and unknowable" spreads itself over the endless space,
and thus forms a veil (the Mulaprakriti of Parabraham) which conceals
this Absolute point. (*Vide infra*)*.*

In the cosmogonies of all the nations it is the "Architects" synthesized
by Demiurgos (in the Bible the "Elohim"), who fashion Kosmos out of
Chaos, and who are the collective *Theos*, "male-female," Spirit and
matter. "By a series (*yom*) of foundations (*hasoth*) the Alhim caused
earth and heaven to be" (Gen. ii., 4). In the Bible it is first *Alhim*,
then Jahva-Alhim, and finally Jehovah --after the separation of the
sexes in chapter iv. of Genesis. It is noticeable that nowhere, except
in the later, the *last* Cosmogonies of our Fifth race, is the ineffable
and unutterable **N**AME\*\*\* -- the symbol of the Unknown Deity, which
was used only in the **M**YSTERIES -- used in connection with the
"Creation" of the Universe. It is the "Movers," the "Runners," the
*theoi* (from \[\[*theein*\]\], "to run"), who do the work of formation,
the "Messengers" of the manvantaric law, who have now become in
Christianity the "messengers" (malachim); and it seems the same in
Hinduism or early Brahmanism. For it is not Brahma who creates in the
*Rig Veda*, but the Prajapati, the "Lords of Being," who are the
*Rishis;* the word *Rishi* (according to Professor Mahadeo Kunte) being
connected with the word to move, to lead on, applied to them in their
terrestrial character, when, as Patriarchs, they lead their hosts on the
Seven Rivers.

Moreover, the very word "God" in the singular, embracing all the gods --
or *theos* from *theoi* -- came to the "superior" civilized nations from
a strange source, one entirely and as pre-eminently *phallic* as the

century preceding our era.

sincere, open-spoken *lingham* of India. The attempt to derive God from
the Anglo-Saxon synonym "good" is an abandoned idea, for in no other
language, in all of which the term varies more or less, from the Persian
Khoda down to the Latin *Deus*, has an instance been found of a name of
God being derived from the attribute of *Goodness.* To the Latin races
it comes from the Aryan *Dyaus* (the Day); to the Slavonian, from the
Greek Bacchus (*Bagh-bog*); and to the Saxon races directly from the
Hebrew *Yodh* or *Jod.* The latter is ![](sd1-78c.gif), the
number-letter 10, male and female, and Jod the phallic *hook:* -- hence
the Saxon *Godh*, the Germanic *Gott*, and the English *God.* This
symbolic term may be said to represent the Creator of physical
"Humanity," on the *terrestrial* plane; but surely it had nothing to do
with the formation or "Creation" of Spirit, gods, or Kosmos!

Chaos-Theos-Kosmos, the triple deity, is *all in all.* Therefore, it is
said to be male and female, good and evil, positive and negative: the
whole series of contrasted qualities. When latent (in pralaya) it is
incognizable and becomes the *unknowable Deity.* It can be known only in
its active functions; hence as *matter-Force* and *living Spirit*, the
correlations and outcome, or the expression, on the visible plane, of
the ultimate and ever-to-be unknown UNITY.

In its turn this triple unit is the producer of the four primary
"Elements,"\* which are known in our visible terrestrial nature as the
seven (so far the *five*) Elements, each divisible into forty-nine (or
seven times seven) sub-elements, with about seventy of which Chemistry
is acquainted. Every Cosmical Element such as Fire, Air, Water, Earth,
partaking of the qualities and defects of their Primaries, are in their
nature Good and Evil, Force (or Spirit) and Matter, etc., etc.; and
each, therefore, is at one and the same time Life and Death, Health and
Disease, Action and Reaction. (*See Section XIV.*, "*The Four
Elements.*") They are ever and constantly forming matter under the
never-ceasing impulse of the **O**NE Element (the *incognizable*),
represented in the world of phenomena by 'AEther, or "the immortal gods
who give birth and life to all."

In "the Philosophical writings of Solomon Ben Yehudah Ibn Gebirol"
(translated in Mr. Isaac Myer's *Kabbalah*, just published) it is said
on the structure of the Universe, "R. Yehudah began, it is written: --
'Elohim said: Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters.'
Come, see, at the time that the Holy. . . . created the World, He

###### \[\[Footnote(s)\]\] -------------------------------------------------

\* The Cosmic Tabernacle of Moses, erected by him in the Desert, was
*square*, representing the four cardinal points and the four Elements,
as Josephus tells his readers (*Antiq. 1*, *viii ch.*, *xxii.*) It is
the idea taken from the pyramids in Egypt and in Tyre, where the
pyramids became pillars, the Genii, or Angels have their abodes in the
four respective points (See ยง *xiv.;* "*The Four Elements.*")

created 7 heavens above, 7 earths below, 7 seas, 7 days, 7 rivers, 7
weeks, 7 years, 7 times, and 7,000 years that the world has been. The
Holy *is the seventh* of all," etc. (p. 415).

This, besides showing a strange identity with the cosmogony of the
Puranas (*e.g*., Vishnu Purana 1st Book), corroborates with regard to
number seven, all our teachings as briefly given in "Esoteric Buddhism."

The Hindus have an endless series of allegories to express this idea. In
the primordial Chaos, before it became developed into the *Seven Oceans*
(Sapta Samudra) -- emblematical of the *seven gunas* (conditioned
qualities) composed of *trigunas* (Satwa, Rajas and Tamas, see Puranas)
-- lie latent both *Amrita* (immortality) and *Visha* (poison, death,
evil). This allegory is found in the "Churning of the Ocean" by the
gods. *Amrita* is beyond any guna, for it is UNCONDITIONED *per se;* yet
when fallen into the phenomenal creation it got mixed up with **E**VIL,
*Chaos*, with latent *theos* in it, and before *Kosmos* was evolved.
Hence, one finds Vishnu -- standing here for eternal Law -- periodically
calling forth Kosmos into activity -- "churning out of the *primitive*
Ocean (boundless Chaos) the *Amrita* of Eternity, reserved only for the
gods and devas; and he has to employ in the task *Nagas* and *Asuras* --
demons in exoteric Hinduism. The whole allegory is highly philosophical,
and we find it repeated in every philosophical System. Plato, having
fully embraced the ideas of Pythagoras -- who had brought them from
India -- compiled and published them in a form more intelligible than
the mysterious numerals of the Greek Sage. Thus the *Kosmos* is "the
Son" with Plato, having for his father and mother the Divine Thought and
Matter.\*

"The Egyptians," says Dunlap,\*\* "distinguish between an older and
younger Horus; the former the *brother* of Osiris, the latter the *son*
of Osiris and Isis." The first is the *Idea* of the world remaining in
the Demiurgic Mind, "born in darkness before the creation of the world."
The second Horus is this "Idea" going forth from the *Logos*, becoming
clothed with matter, and assuming an actual existence.\*\*\*

"The Mundane God, eternal, boundless, young and old, of winding
form,"\*\*\*\* say the *Chaldean oracles.*

This "winding form" is a figure to express the vibratory motion of the
Astral Light, with which the ancient priests were perfectly well
acquainted, though its name was invented by the Martinists.

Now Cosmolatry has the finger of scorn pointed at its superstitions by
modern Science, which ought, however, as advised by a French

savant, before laughing at it "to remodel entirely its own system of
cosmo-pneumatological education." *Satis eloquentiae*, *sapientiae
parvum.* Cosmolatry like Pantheism may be made to yield in its ultimate
expression the words applied to Vishnu . . . . "He is only the *ideal*
Cause of the *Potencies* to be created in the work of creation; and from
him proceed the potencies to be created, after they have become the real
cause. *Save that one ideal cause*, there is no other to which the world
can be referred. . . . *Through the potency of that cause*, every
created thing comes by its proper nature." (*Original Sanskrit Texts*,
