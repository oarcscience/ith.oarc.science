(*a*) This relates to an inclination of the axis -- of which there were
several -- to a consequent deluge and chaos on Earth (having, however,
no reference to primeval chaos), in which monsters, half-human,
half-animal, were generated. We find it mentioned in the "Book of the
Dead," and also in the Chaldean account of creation, on the Cutha
Tablets, however mutilated.

division. In the "*Physician*'*s Hymn,*" (X 97 1) it is said that "the
plants came into being *three ages* (Triyugam) before the gods" on our
Earth (See "Chronology of the Brahmins" at the end of this Stanza).

It is not even allegory. Here we have *facts,* that are found repeated
in the account of *Pymander,* as well as in the Chaldean tablets of
creation. The verses may almost be checked by the Cosmogony, as given by
Berosus, which has been disfigured out of recognition by Eusebius, but
some of the features of which may yet be found in fragments left by
ancient Greek authors -- Apollodorus, Alexander Polyhistor, etc., etc.
"The water-men terrible and bad," who were the production of physical
nature alone, a result of the "evolutionary impulse" and the first
attempt to create *man* the "crown," and the aim and goal of all animal
life on Earth -- are shown to be failures in our Stanzas. Do we not find
the same in the Berosian Cosmogony, denounced with such vehemence as the
culmination of heathen absurdity? And yet who of the Evolutionists can
say that things in the beginning have not come to pass as they are
described? That, as maintained in the Puranas, the Egyptian and Chaldean
fragments, and even in Genesis, there have not been two, and even more,
"creations" before the last formation of the Globe; which, changing its
geological and atmospheric conditions, changed also its flora, its
fauna, and its men? This claim agrees not only with every ancient
Cosmogony, but also with modern science, and even, to a certain degree,
with the theory of evolution, as may be demonstrated in a few words.

There is no "dark creation," no "Evil Dragon" conquered by a Sun-God, in
the earliest World-Cosmogonies. Even with the Akkads, the great Deep
(the Watery Abyss, or **S**PACE) was the birthplace and abode of Ea,
Wisdom, the incognizable infinite Deity. But with the Semites and the
later Chaldeans, the fathomless Deep of Wisdom becomes gross matter,
sinful Substance, and Ea is changed into Tiamat, the dragon slain by
Merodach, or Satan, in the astral waves.

In the Hindu Puranas, Brahma, the creator, is seen recommencing *de*
*novo* several creations after as many failures; and two great creations
are mentioned,\* the Padma and the Varaha, the present, when the Earth
was lifted out of the water by Brahma, in the shape of a boar, or
"Varaha Avatar." Creation is shown as a sport, an amusement (Lila) of
the creative god. The Zohar speaks of primordial worlds, which perished
as soon as they came into existence. And the same is said in Midraish,
Rabbi Abahu explaining distinctly (in Bereschith Rabba, Parscha **IX**.)
that "the Holy One" had successively created and de-

###### \[\[Footnote(s)\]\] -------------------------------------------------

\* These two must not be confused with the seven creations or divisions
in each Kalpa (See Book I. "*The Seven Creations*")*.* The *primary* and
*secondary* creations are here meant.

stroyed sundry worlds, before he succeeded in the present one. This does
not relate only to other worlds in space, but to a mystery of our own
globe contained in the allegory about the "kings of Edom." For the
words, "This one pleases me," are repeated in Genesis i. 31, though in
disfigured terms, as usual. The Chaldean fragments of Cosmogony on the
Cuneiform inscriptions, and elsewhere, show two distinct creations of
animals and men, the first being destroyed, as it was a failure. The
Cosmogonical tablets prove that this our actual creation was preceded by
others (See "Hibbert Lectures," p. 390); and as shown by the author of
"The Qabbalah," in the Zohar, Siphrah Dzeniouta, in Jovah Rabbah,
128*a*, etc., etc. The Kabala states the same.

(*b*) Oannes (or Dagon, the Chaldean "Man-fish") divides his Cosmogony
and Genesis into two portions. First the abyss of waters and darkness,
wherein resided most hideous beings --

-men with wings, four and two-faced men, human beings with two heads,
with the legs and horns of a goat (our "goat-men,")\* hippocentaurs,
bulls with the heads of men, and dogs with tails of fishes. In short,
combinations of various animals and men, of fishes, reptiles and other
monstrous animals assuming each other's shapes and countenances. The
feminine element they resided in, is personified by Thalatth -- the Sea,
or "Water" -- which was finally conquered by Belus, the male principle.
And Polyhistor says: "Belus came and cut the woman asunder, and of one
half of her he formed the Earth, and of the other half the heavens, and
at the same time he destroyed the animals within her." As pertinently
remarked by I. Myer, "with the Akkadians each object and power of Nature
had its Zi, Spirit. The Akkadians formed their deities into triads,
usually males (sexless, rather?); the Semites also had triadic deities,
but introduced sex" (p. 246) -- or phallicism. With the Aryans and the
earliest Akkadians all things are emanations *through,* not *by,* a
creator or logos. With the Semites everything is *begotten.*

\* Whence the identity of the ideas? The Chinese have the same
traditions. According to the commentator Kwoh P'oh, in the work called
*Shan-Hai-King,* "Wonders by Sea and Land," a work which was written by
the historiographer Chung Ku from engravings on nine urns made by the
Emperor Yu, (B.C. 2255), an interview is mentioned with men *having two
distinct faces on their heads,* before and behind, monsters with bodies
of goats and human faces, etc. Gould, in his "*Mythical Monsters,*" p.
27, giving the names of some authors on Natural History, mentions
*Shan-Hai-King. Ac*cording to Kwoh P'oh (A.D. 276-324) this work was
compiled three thousand years before his time, or at seven dynasties
distance. Yang Sun of the Ming Dynasty (commencing A.D. 1368) states
that it was compiled by Kung Chia and Chung Ku (as stated above). Chung
Ku at the time of the last emperor of the Hia dynasty, B.C. 1818,
fearing that the emperor might destroy the books treating of the ancient
time, carried them in his flight to Yin. (See "*Mythical Monsters,*" by
C. Gould, p. 27.)

(*a*) The explanations given in our Stanzas are far more clear than that
which the legend of creation from the *Cutha* tablet would give, even
were it complete. What is preserved on it, however, corroborates them.
For, in the tablet, "the Lord of Angels" destroys the men in the abyss,
when "there were not left the carcases and waste" after they were
slaughtered. After which they, the Great Gods, create men with the
bodies of birds of the desert, human beings, "seven kings, brothers of
the same family," etc., which is a reference to the locomotive qualities
of the primary ethereal bodies of men, which could fly as well as they
could walk,\*\* but who "were destroyed" because they were not
"*perfect,*" *i.e.*, they "were sexless, like the Kings of Edom."

Weeded of metaphors and allegories, what will science say to this idea
of a primordial creation of species? It will object to the "Angels" and
"Spirits" having anything to do therewith: but if it is nature and the
physical law of evolution that are the creators of all there is now on
Earth, why could there be "no such abyss" when the globe was covered
with waters, in which numbers of monstrous beings were generated? Is it
the "human beings" and animals with human heads and double faces, which
are a point of the objection? But if man is only a higher animal and has
evolved from the brute species by an infinite series of transformations,
why could not the "missing links" have had human heads attached to the
bodies of animals, or, being two-headed, have heads of beasts and *vice
versa,* in Nature's early efforts? Are we not shown during the
geological periods, in the ages of the reptiles and the mammalia,
lizards with birds' wings, and serpents' heads on animal bodies.\*\*\*
And, arguing from the standpoint of science, does not even our modern
human race occasionally furnish us with monster-specimens: two-headed
children, animal bodies with human heads, dog-headed babies, etc., etc.?
And this proves that, if nature will still play such

freaks now that she has settled for ages into the order of her
evolutionary work, monsters, like those described by Berosus, were a
possibility in her opening programme; which possibility may even have
existed once upon a time as a law, before she sorted out her species and
began regular work upon them; which indeed now admits of definite proof
by the bare fact of "**R**EVERSION," as science puts it.

This is what the doctrine teaches and demonstrates by numerous proofs.
But we shall not wait for the approval of either dogmatic theology or
materialistic science, but proceed with the Stanzas. Let these speak for
themselves, with the help of the light thrown by the Commentaries and
their explanations; the scientific aspect of these questions will be
considered later on.

Thus physical nature, when left to herself in the creation of animal and
man, is shown to have failed. She can produce the first two and the
lower animal kingdoms, but when it comes to the turn of man, spiritual,
independent and intelligent powers are required for his creation,
besides the "coats of skin" and the "Breath of animal Life." The human
Monads of preceding Rounds need something higher than purely physical
materials to build their personalities with, under the penalty of
remaining even below any "Frankenstein" animal.\*

-------

###### \[\[Footnote(s)\]\] -------------------------------------------------

\* In the first volume of the lately published "*Introduction a
l*'*atude des Races Humaines,*" by M. de Quatrefages, there is proof
that since the post-tertiary period and even before that time -- since
many Races were already scattered during that age on the face of the
Earth -- man has not altered one iota in his physical structure. And if,
surrounded for ages by a fauna that altered from one period or cycle to
another, which died out, which was reborn in other forms -- so that now
there does not exist one single animal on Earth, large or small,
contemporary with the man of that period -- if, then, every animal has
been transformed save man himself, this fact goes to prove not only his
antiquity, but that he is a *distinct Kingdom.* Why should he alone have
escaped transformation? Because, says de Quatrefages, the weapon used by
him, in his struggle with nature and the ever-changing geological
conditions and elements, was "his *psychic force,* *not his physical
strength or body*," as in the case of animals. Give man only that dose
of intelligence and reason with which other mammalia are endowed, and
with his present bodily organization he will show himself the most
helpless of creatures of Earth. And as everything goes to prove that the
*human* *organism with all its characteristics, peculiarities and
idiosyncrasies existed already on our Globe in those far distant
geological periods when there was not yet one single specimen of the
now-existing forms of mammalia*, what is the unavoidable conclusion? Why
this: Since all the human races are of one and the same species, it
follows that this species is the *most ancient of all* the now-living
mammalia. Therefore it is the most stable and persevering of all, and
was already as fully developed as it is now when all the other mammalia
now known had not made even their first approach to appearance on this
Earth. Such is the opinion of the great French Naturalist, who gives
thereby a terrible blow to Darwinism.

(*a*) Says the Catechism (Commentaries): --

"*It is from the material Worlds that descend they, who fashion physical
man at the new Manvantaras. They are inferior Lha* (*Spirits*)*,
possessed of a dual body* (an astral within an ethereal form). *They are
the fashioners and creators of our body of illusion*." . . . .

"*Into the forms projected by the Lha* (Pitris) *the two letters\*\**
(the Monad, called also 'the Double Dragon') *descend from the spheres
of expectation.\*\*\* But they are like a roof with no walls, nor
pillars to rest upon*." . . . .

"*Man needs four flames and three fires to become one on Earth, and he
requires the essence of the forty-nine fires\*\*\*\* to be perfect. It
is those who have deserted the Superior Spheres, the Gods of
Will,\*\*\*\*\* who complete the Manu of illusion. For the* '*Double
Dragon*' *has no hold upon the mere form. It is like the breeze where
there is no tree or branch to receive and harbour it. It cannot affect
the form where there is no agent of transmission* (Manas, "Mind") *and
the form knows it not.*"

"*In the highest worlds, the three are one,\*\*\*\*\*\* on Earth* (*at
first*) *the one becomes two. They are like the two* (*side*) *lines of
a triangle that has lost its bottom line -- which is the third fire.*"

Now this requires some explanation before proceeding any further. To do
so especially for the benefit of our Aryan Hindu brethren --

is the father of the fire of the *Pitris* (See *Vayu Purana*). But this

whose esoteric interpretations may differ from our own -- we shall have
to explain to them the foregoing by certain passages in their own
exoteric books, namely, the Puranas. In the allegories of the latter,
Brahma, who is collectively the creative Force of the Universe, is said
to be "at the beginning of the Yugas (cycles) . . . . *Possessed of the
desire and of the power to create, and, impelled by the potencies of
what is to be created,* again and again does he, at the outset of a
Kalpa, put forth a similar creation," (see *Vishnu Purana,* Book I. ch.
V., closing Sloka. Also "*Manava Dharma Shastra*" I. 30.) It is now
proposed to examine the exoteric account in the Vishnu Purana, and see
how much it may agree or disagree with our occult version.

-------

**C**REATION OF **D**IVINE **B**EINGS IN THE **E**XOTERIC **A**CCOUNTS.

In the *Vishnu Purana* -- which is certainly the earliest of all the
scriptures of that name -- we find, as in all the others, Brahma
assuming as the male God, for purposes of creation, "*four bodies
invested by three qualities.*"*\** It is said: "In this manner,
Maitreya, *Jyotsna* (dawn), *Ratri* (night)*, Ahan* (day), and *Sandhya*
(evening twilight) are the four bodies of Brahma" . . (p. 81, Vol. I.,
Wilson's translation). As Parasara explains it, when Brahma wants to
create the world anew and construct progeny *through his will*, in the
fourfold condition (or the four orders of beings) termed gods (Dhyan
Chohans), Demons\*\* (*i.e.*, more material Devas), Progenitors (Pitris)
and men, "he collects Yoga-like (Yuyuje) his mind."

Strange to say, he begins by creating DEMONS, who thus take precedence
over the angels or gods. This is no incongruity, nor is it due to
inconsistency, but has, like all the rest, a profound esoteric meaning,
quite clear to one free from Christian theological prejudice. He who
bears in mind that the principle **M**AHAT, or Intellect, the "Universal
Mind" (literally "the great"), which esoteric philosophy explains as the
"manifested Omniscience" -- the "first product" of Pradhana (primordial
matter) as Vishnu Purana says, but the first Cosmic aspect of Parabrahm
or the esoteric SAT, the Universal Soul,\*\*\* as Occultism

###### \[\[Footnote(s)\]\] -------------------------------------------------

\* This has in *esotericism* a direct bearing upon the seven principles
of the manifested Brahma, or universe, in the same order as in man.
Exoterically, it is only four principles.

\*\* *Demons* is a very loose word to use, as it applies to a great
number of inferior -- *i.e.,* more material -- Spirits, or minor Gods,
who are so termed because they "war" with the higher ones; but they are
no devils.

\*\*\* The same order of principles in man: -- *Atma* (Spirit)*, Buddhi*
(Soul), its vehicle, as Matter is the *Vahan* of Spirit, and *Manas*
(mind), the third, or the fifth microcosmically. On the *plane of
personality, Manas* is the first.

###### \[\[Vol. 2, Page\]\] 59 THE BODIES OF BRAHMA.

teaches -- is at the root of **S**ELF-Consciousness, will understand the
reason why. The so-called "Demons" -- who are (esoterically) the
Self-asserting and (intellectually) active Principle -- are the
*positive poles of creation,* so to say; hence, the first produced. This
is in brief the process as narrated allegorically in the Puranas.

"Having concentrated his mind into itself and the quality of darkness
pervading Brahma's assumed body, the Asuras, issuing from his thigh,
were first produced; after which, abandoning this body, it was
transformed into NIGHT." (See Part **II.**, ยง "*The Fallen Angels.*")

Two important points are involved herein: -- (*a*) Primarily in the
*Rig-Veda,* the "Asuras" are shown as *spiritual divine beings;* their
etymology is derived from *asu* (breath), the "Breath of God," and they
mean the same as the Supreme Spirit or the Zoroastrian *Ahura.* It is
later on, for purposes of theology and dogma, that they are shown
issuing from Brahma's thigh, and that their name began to be derived
from a privative, and *sura,* god (solar deities), or *not-a-god,* and
that they became the enemies of the gods. Every ancient theogony without
exception -- from the Aryan and the Egyptian down to that of Hesiod --
places, in the order of Cosmogonical evolution, Night before the Day;
even *Genesis,* where "darkness is upon the face of the deep" before
"the *first day.*" The reason for this is that every Cosmogony -- except
in the Secret Doctrine -- begins by the "Secondary Creation" so-called:
to wit, the *manifested* Universe, the Genesis of which has to open by a
marked differentiation between the eternal Light of *Primary* Creation,
whose mystery must remain for ever "Darkness" to the prying finite
conception and intellect of the profane, and the Secondary Evolution of
manifested visible nature. The Veda contains the whole philosophy of
that division without having ever been correctly explained by our
Orientalists, because it has *never been understood* by them.

Continuing to create, Brahma assumes another form, that of the Day, and
creates from his breath the gods, who are endowed with the quality of
goodness (passivity)\*. In his next body the quality of great passivity
prevailed, which is also (negative) goodness, and from the side of that
personage issued the Pitris, the progenitors of men, because, as the
text explains, "Brahma thought of himself (during the process) as the
father of the world."\*\* This is *Kriya-sakti --* the mysterious *Yoga*
power

###### \[\[Footnote(s)\]\] -------------------------------------------------

\* Thus, says the Commentary, the saying "by day the gods are most
powerful, and by night the demons," is purely allegorical.

\*\* This *thinking of oneself* as this, that, or the other, is the
chief factor in the production of every kind of psychic or even physical
phenomena. The words "whosoever shall say to this mountain be thou
removed and cast into the sea, and *shall not doubt* . . . . that thing
will come to pass," are no vain words. Only the word "faith" ought to be
translated by WILL. Faith without Will is like a wind-mill without
*wind* -- barren of results.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

###### \[\[Vol. 2, Page\]\] 60 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.

explained elsewhere. This body of Brahma when cast off became the
*Sandhya* (evening twilight), the interval between day and night.

Finally Brahma assumed his last form pervaded by the *quality of
foulness,* "and from this MEN, in whom foulness and passion predominate,
were produced." This body when cast off became the dawn, or morning
twilight -- the twilight of Humanity. Here Brahma stands esoterically
for the *Pitris.* He is collectively the Pitar, "father."

The true esoteric meaning of this allegory must now be explained. Brahma
here symbolizes personally the collective creators of the World and Men
-- the universe with all its numberless productions of things movable
and (seemingly) immovable.\* He is collectively the Prajapatis, the
Lords of Being; and the four bodies typify the four classes of creative
powers or Dhyan Chohans, described in the Commentary directly following
Stanza **VII**. in Book I. The whole philosophy of the so-called
"Creation" of the good and evil in this world and of the whole cycle of
Manvantaric results therefrom, hangs on the correct comprehension of
these Four bodies of Brahma.

The reader will now be prepared to understand the real, the esoteric
significance of what follows. Moreover there is an important point to be
cleared up. Christian theology having arbitrarily settled and agreed
that Satan with his Fallen Angels belonged to the earliest creation,
Satan being the first-created, the wisest and most beautiful of God's
Archangels, the word was given, the key-note struck. Henceforth all the
*pagan* scriptures were made to yield the same meaning, and all were
shown to be demoniacal, and it *was* and *is* claimed that *truth and
fact* belong to, and commence only with, Christianity. Even the
Orientalists and Mythologists, some of them no Christians at all but
"infidels," or men of science, entered unconsciously to themselves, and
by the mere force of association of ideas and habit, into the
theological groove. Purely Brahmanical considerations, based on greed of
power and ambition, allowed the masses to remain in ignorance of great
truths; and the same causes led the Initiates among the early Christians
to remain silent, while those who had never known the truth disfigured
the order of things, judging of the hierarchy of "Angels" by their
exoteric form. Thus as the *Asuras* had become the rebellious inferior
gods fighting the higher ones in popular creeds, so the highest
archangel, in truth the Agathodaemon, the eldest benevolent Logos,
became with theology the "Adversary" or *Satan.* But is this warranted
by the correct interpretation of any old Scripture? The answer is, *most
certainly not.* As the Mazdean Scriptures of the

###### \[\[Footnote(s)\]\] -------------------------------------------------

\* The same idea is found in the first four chapters of *Genesis,* with
their "Lord" and "God," which are the *Elohim* and the Androgynous
*Eloha*.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

###### \[\[Vol. 2, Page\]\] 61 WHAT THE GNOSTICS SAY.

*Zend-Avesta,* the *Vendidad* and others correct and expose the later
cunning shuffling of the gods in the Hindu Pantheon, and restore through
**A**HURA the *Asuras* to their legitimate place in theogony, so the
recent discoveries of the Chaldean tablets vindicate the good name of
the first divine Emanations. This is easily proved. Christian Angelology
is directly and solely derived from that of the Pharisees, who brought
their tenets from Babylonia. The Sadducees, the real guardians of the
Laws of Moses, knew not of, and rejected, any angels, opposing even the
immortality of the human *Soul* (not impersonal Spirit). In the Bible
the only "Angels" spoken of are the "Sons of God" mentioned in Genesis
vi. (who are now regarded as the *Nephilim,* the Fallen Angels), and
several angels in human form, the "Messengers" of the Jewish God, whose
own rank needs a closer analysis than heretofore given. (*Vide Supra,*
Stanza I., sub-sections 2, *3, et seq.,* where it is shown that the
early Akkadians called *Ea*, Wisdom, that which was disfigured by the
later Chaldees and Semites into *Tismat,* Tisalat and the Thallath of
Berosus, the female Sea Dragon, now Satan.) Truly -- "How art thou
fallen (by the hand of man), O bright star and son of the morning"!

Now what do the Babylonian accounts of "Creation," as found on the
Assyrian fragments of tiles, tell us; those very accounts upon which the
Pharisees built their angelology? But compare Mr. G. Smith's "*Assyrian
Discoveries,*" p. 398, and his "*Chaldean Account of Genesis,*" p. 107.
The "*Tablet with the story of the Seven Wicked Gods or Spirits,*" has
the following account -- we print the important passages in italics: --

> 1\. In the *first days* the evil Gods,  
> 2. the *angels, who were in rebellion,* who *in the lower part of
> heaven*  
> 3*. had been created,*  
> 4. they caused their evil work  
> 5. devising with wicked heads . . . . etc.

Thus we are shown, as plainly as can be, on a fragment which remained
unbroken, so that there can be no dubious reading, that the "rebellious
angels" had been created in the *lower part of heaven, i.e.,* that they
belonged and do belong to a *material plane of evolution,* although as
it is not the plane of which we are made cognizant through our senses,
it remains generally invisible to us, and is thus regarded as
subjective. Were the Gnostics so wrong, after this, in affirming that
this our visible world, and especially the Earth, had been created by
*lower* angels, the inferior Elohim, of which, as they taught, the God
of Israel was one. These Gnostics were nearer in time to the records of
the Archaic Secret Doctrine, and therefore ought to be allowed to have
known better than non-initiated Christians, who took upon themselves,
hundreds of years

later, to remodel and *correct* what was said. But let us see what the
same Tablet says further on: --

> 7\. There were seven of them (the wicked gods) . . . . (then follows

> 15\. The seven of them, messengers of the God Anu, their king.

Now Anu belongs to the Chaldean trinity, and is identical with Sin, the
"Moon," in one aspect. And the Moon in the Hebrew Kabala is the Argha of
the seed of all material life, and is still more closely connected,
kabalistically, with Jehovah, who is double-sexed as Anu is. They are
both represented in Esotericism and viewed from a dual aspect: male or
spiritual, female or material, or Spirit and Matter, the two
antagonistic principles. Hence the "Messengers of Anu," (who is Sin, the
"Moon,") are shown, in verses 28 to 41, as being finally overpowered by
the same Sin with the help of Bel (the Sun) and Ishtar (Venus). This is
regarded as a contradiction by the Assyriologists, but is simply
*metaphysics* in the esoteric teaching.

There is more than one interpretation, for there are seven keys to the
mystery of the Fall. Moreover there are two "Falls" in Theology: the
rebellion of the Archangels and their "Fall," and the "Fall" of Adam and
Eve. Thus the lower as well as the higher Hierarchies are charged with a
supposed crime. The word "supposed" is the true and correct term, for in
both cases it is founded on misconception. Both are considered in
Occultism as Karmic effects, and both belong to the law of Evolution:
intellectual and spiritual on the one hand, physical and psychic on the
other. The "Fall" is a universal allegory. It sets forth at one end of
the ladder of Evolution the "rebellion," *i.e.,* the action of
differentiating intellection or consciousness on its various planes,
seeking union with matter; and at the other, the lower end, the
rebellion of matter against Spirit, or of action against spiritual
inertia. And here lies the germ of an error which has had such
disastrous effects on the intelligence of civilized societies for over
1,800 years. In the original allegory it is matter -- hence the more
material angels -- which was regarded as the conqueror of Spirit, or the
Archangels who "fell" on this plane. "They of the *flaming sword* (or
animal passions) had put to flight the Spirits of Darkness." Yet it is
the latter who fought for the supremacy of the conscious and divine
spirituality on Earth and failed, succumbing to the power of matter. But
in theological dogma we see the reverse. It is Michael, "who is like
unto God," the representative of Jehovah, who is the leader of the
celestial hosts -- as Lucifer, in Milton's fancy, is of the infernal
hosts -- who has the best of Satan. It is true that the nature of

------------------------------------------------------------------------

###### \[\[Vol. 2, Page\]\] 63 WHO ARE THE "FLAMES"?

Michael depends upon that of his Creator and Master. Who the latter is,
one may find out by carefully studying the allegory of the "War in
Heaven" with the astronomical key. As shown by Bentley, the "War of the
Titans against the gods" in Hesiod, and also the war of the Asuras (or
the Tarakamaya) against the devas in Puranic legend, are identical in
all save the names. The aspects of the stars show (Bentley taking the
year 945 **B.C**. as the nearest date for such conjunction) that "all
the planets, except Saturn, were on the same side of the heavens as the
Sun and Moon," and hence were his opponents. And yet it is Saturn, or
the Jewish "Moon-god," who is shown as prevailing, both by Hesiod and
Moses, neither of whom was understood. Thus it was that the real meaning
became distorted.

(*a*) The "Flames" are a Hierarchy of Spirits parallel to, if not
identical with, the "burning" fiery *Saraph* (Seraphim) mentioned by
Isaiah (vi. 2-6), those who attend, according to Hebrew Theogony, "the
Throne of the Almighty." Melha is the Lord of the "Flames." When he
appears on Earth, he assumes the personality of a Buddha, says a popular
legend. He is one of the most ancient and revered *Lhas, a* Buddhist St.
Michael.

(*b*) The word "Below" must not be taken to mean infernal regions, but
simply a spiritual, or rather ethereal, Being of a lower grade, because

the capital of Tibet, *Lha-ssa.*

evolution of life on Earth, there may be another allegorical meaning
attached to this Sloka, or indeed, as is taught, several. The FLAMES, or
"Fires," represent Spirit, or the male element, and "Water," matter, or
the opposite element. And here again we find, in the action of the
Spirit slaying the purely material form, a reference to the eternal
struggle, on the physical and psychic planes, between Spirit and Matter,
besides a scientific cosmic fact. For, as said in the next verse: --

-------

9\. **M**OTHER-WATER, THE GREAT SEA WEPT. **S**HE AROSE, SHE DISAPPEARED
IN THE **M**OON, WHICH HAD LIFTED HER, WHICH HAD GIVEN HER BIRTH (*a*).

(*a*) Now what can this mean? Is it not an evident reference to tidal
action in the early stage of the history of our planet in its fourth
Round? Modern research has been busy of late in its speculations on the
Palaeozoic high-tides. Mr. Darwin's theory was that not less than
52,000,000 years ago -- and probably much more -- the Moon originated
from the Earth's plastic mass. Starting from the point where research
was left by Helmholtz, Ferrel, Sir William Thomson and others, he
retraced the course of tidal retardation of the earth's rotary motions
far back into the very night of time, and placed the Moon during the
infancy of our planet at only "a fraction of its present distance." In
short, his theory was that it is the Moon which separated from the
Earth. The tidal elevation concurring with the swing of the globular
mass -- centrifugal tendency being then nearly equal to gravity -- the
latter was overcome, and the tidally elevated mass could thus separate
completely from the Earth.\*

The Occult teaching is the reverse of this. The Moon is far older than
the Earth; and, as explained in Book I., it is the latter which owes its
being to the former, however astronomy and geology may explain the fact.
Hence, the tides and the attraction to the Moon, as shown by the liquid
portion of the Globe ever striving to raise itself towards its parent.
This is the meaning of the sentence that "the Mother-Water arose and
disappeared in the Moon, which had lifted her, which had given her
birth."

geologists, against this theory. Compare Sir R. S. Bull's article in
"*Nature*" (Dec. 1, 1881), and also what the American geologists say.

(*a*) The time for its incrustation had arrived. The waters had
separated and the process was started. It was the beginning of a new
life. This is what one key divulges to us. Another key teaches the
origin of Water, its admixture with Fire (liquid fire it calls
it),\*\*\* and enters upon an alchemical description of the progeny of
the two -- solid matter such as minerals and earths. From the "Waters of
Space," the progeny of the male Spirit-Fire and the female (gaseous)
Water has become the Oceanic expanse on Earth. Varuna is dragged down
from the infinite Space, to reign as Neptune over the finite Seas. As
always, the popular fancy is found to be based on a strictly scientific
foundation.

Water is the symbol of the female element everywhere; *mater*, from
which the letter M, is derived pictorially from \[\[diagram\]\] a water
hieroglyph. It is the universal matrix or the "Great Deep." Venus, the
great Mother-Virgin, issues forth from the Sea-wave, and Cupid or *Eros
is* her son. But Venus is the later mythological variant of *Gaia* (or
*Gaea*)*,* the Earth, which, in its higher aspect is Nature
(*Prakriti*)*,* and metaphysically Aditi, and even Mulaprakriti, the
root of Prakriti or its noumenon.

Hence Cupid or Love in his primitive sense is Eros, the Divine Will, or
*Desire of manifesting itself through visible creation.* Thence Fohat,
the prototype of Eros, becomes on Earth the great power
"Life-electricity," or the Spirit of "Life-giving." Let us remember the
Greek Theogony and enter into the spirit of its philosophy. We are
taught by the Greeks (See "*Iliad*" IV., 201, 246) that all things, gods
included, owe their being to the Ocean and his wife Tethys, the latter
being Gaea, the Earth or Nature. But who is *Ocean?* Ocean is the
immeasurable SPACE (Spirit in Chaos), which is the Deity (*see* Book
I.); and Tethys is not the Earth, but primordial matter in the process
of formation. In our case it is no longer Aditi-Gaea who begets
*Ouranos* or Varuna, the chief Aditya among the seven planetary gods,
but Prakriti, materialised and localised. The Moon, masculine in its
theogonic character, is,

account of Berosus, was Thallath, in Greek *Thalassa,* "the Sea."

the heads of horses) created by Brahma in the commencement of the Kalpa.

is the male emblem thereof. Water is the progeny of the Moon, an
androgyne deity with every nation.

Evolution proceeds on the laws of analogy in Kosmos as in the formation
of the smallest globe. Thus the above, applying to the *modus operandi*
at the time when the Universe was appearing, applies also in the case of
our Earth's formation.

This Stanza opens by speaking of thirty crores, 30,000,000, of years. We
may be asked -- What could the ancients know of the duration of
geological periods, when no modern scientist or mathematician is able to
calculate their duration with anything like approximate accuracy?
Whether they had or had not better means (and it is maintained that they
had them in their Zodiacs), still the chronology of the ancient Brahmins
shall now be given as faithfully as possible.

**<span id="chronology">T</span>**HE **C**HRONOLOGY OF THE **B**RAHMINS.

No greater riddle exists in science, no problem is more hopelessly
insoluble, than the question: How old -- even approximately -- are the
Sun and Moon, the Earth and Man? What does modern science know of the
duration of the ages of the World, or even of the length of geological
periods?

Nothing; *absolutely nothing.*

If one turns to science for chronological information, one is told by
those who are straightforward and truthful, as for instance Mr.
Pengelly, the eminent geologist, "We do not know."\* One will learn
that, so far, no trustworthy numerical estimate of the ages of the world
and man could be made, and that both geology and anthropology are at
sea. Yet when a student of esoteric philosophy presumes to bring forward
the teachings of Occult Science, he is at once sat upon. Why should this
be so, since, when reduced to their own physical methods, the greatest
scientists have failed to arrive even at an approximate agreement?

It is true that science can hardly be blamed for it. Indeed, in the
Cimmerian darkness of the prehistoric ages, the explorers are lost in a
labyrinth, whose great corridors are doorless, allowing no visible exit
into the Archaic past. Lost in the maze of their own conflicting
speculations, rejecting, as they have always done, the evidence of
Eastern tradition, without any clue, or one single certain milestone to
guide them, what can geologists or anthropologists do but pick up the
slender

thread of Ariadne where they first perceive it, and then proceed at
perfect random? Therefore we are first told that the farthest date to
which documentary record extends is now generally regarded by
Anthropology as but "the earliest distinctly visible point of the
pre-historic period*.*" (*Encyclopaedia Britannica.*)

At the same time it is confessed that "beyond that period stretches back
a vast indefinite series of prehistoric ages." (*Ibid.*)

It is with those specified "Ages" that we shall begin. They are
"prehistoric" to the naked eye of matter only. To the spiritual eagle
eye of the seer and the prophet of every race, Ariadne's thread
stretches beyond that "historic period" without break or flaw, surely
and steadily, into the very night of time; and the hand which holds it
is too mighty to drop it, or even let it break. Records exist, although
they may be rejected as fanciful by the profane; though many of them are
tacitly accepted by philosophers and men of great learning, and meet
with an unvarying refusal only from the official and collective body of
*orthodox* science. And since the latter refuses to give us even an
approximate idea of the duration of the geological ages -- save in a few
conflicting and contradictory hypotheses -- let us see what Aryan
philosophy can teach us.

Such computations as are given in Manu and the Puranas -- save trifling
and most evidently *intentional* exaggerations -- are, as already
stated, almost identical with those taught in esoteric philosophy. This
may be seen by comparing the two in any Hindu calendar of recognised
orthodoxy.

The best and most complete of all such calendars, at present, as vouched
for by the learned Brahmins of Southern India, is the already mentioned
Tamil calendar called the "Tirukkanda Panchanga," compiled, as we are
told, from, and in full accordance with, secret fragments of Asuramaya's
data. As Asuramaya is said to have been the greatest astronomer, so he
is whispered to have also been the most powerful "Sorcerer" of the
"**W**HITE **I**SLAND, which had become **B**LACK with sin," *i.e.,* of
the islands of Atlantis.

The "White Island" is a symbolical name. Asuramaya is said to have lived
(see the tradition of Jhana-bhaskara) in *Romaka-pura* in the West:
because the name is an allusion to the land and cradle of the
"Sweat-born" of the Third Race. That land or continent had disappeared
ages before Asuramaya lived, since he was an Atlantean; but he was a
direct descendant of the *Wise Race, the Race that never dies.* Many are
the legends concerning this hero, the pupil of Surya (the Sun-God)
himself, as the Indian accounts allege. It matters little whether he
lived on one or another island, but the question is to prove that he was
no myth, as Dr. Weber and others would make him. The

------------------------------------------------------------------------

###### \[\[Vol. 2, Page\]\] 68 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.

fact of "*Romaka-pura* in the West" being named as the birth-place of
this hero of the archaic ages, is the more interesting because it is so
very suggestive of the esoteric teaching about the "Sweat-born" Races,
the men born from the *pores of their parents.* "**R**OMAKUPAS" means
"hair-pores" in Sanskrit. In *Mahabharata XII.* 10,308, a people named
Raumyas are said to have been created from the pores of Virabhadara, the
terrible giant, who destroyed Daksha's sacrifice. Other tribes and
people are also represented as born in this way. All these are
references to the later Second and the earlier Third Root Races.

The following figures are from the calendar just referred to; a footnote
marks the points of disagreement with the figures of the Arya Samaj
school: --

> I. From the beginning of cosmic evolution,\* up  
> to the Hindu year *Tarana* (or 1887) ....................
> 1,955,884,687 years.

> II\. The (astral) mineral, vegetable and animal

> III\. Time, from the first appearance of  
> "Humanity" (on planetary chain)..........................1,664,500,987
> years.\*\*\*

###### \[\[Footnote(s)\]\] -------------------------------------------------

\* The esoteric doctrine says that this "cosmic evolution" refers only
to our solar system; while exoteric Hinduism makes the figures refer, if
we do not mistake, to the whole Universal System.

\*\* Another point of disagreement. Occultism says: "The astral
prototypes of the mineral, vegetable and animal kingdoms up to man have
taken that time (300 million years) to evolve, re-forming out of the
cast-off materials of the preceding Round, which, though very dense and
physical in their own cycle, are relatively ethereal as compared with
the materiality of our present middle Round. At the expiration of these
300 million years, Nature, on the way to the physical and material, down
the arc of descent, begins with mankind and works downwards, hardening
or materialising forms as it proceeds. Thus the fossils found in strata,
to which an antiquity, not of eighteen, but of many hundreds of millions
of years, must be ascribed, belong in reality to forms of the preceding
Round, which, while living, were far more ethereal than physical, as
*we* *know the physical.* That we perceive and disinter them as tangible
forms, is due to the process of materialization or crystallization
referred to, which took place subsequently, at the beginning of the
Fourth Round, and reached its maximum after the appearance of man,
proceeding parallel with his physical evolution. This alone illustrates
the fact that the degree of materiality of the Earth changes *pari
passu* with that of its inhabitants. And thus man now finds, as tangible
fossils, what were once the (to his present senses) ethereal forms of
the lower kingdoms. The above Brahmanical figures refer to evolution
beginning on Globe A, and in the First Round. In this Volume we speak
only of this, the Fourth Round."

\*\*\* This difference and the change of cyphers in the last three
triplets of figures, the writer cannot undertake to account for.
According to every calculation, once the three hundred millions are
subtracted, the figures ought to stand, 1,655,884,687. But they are
given as stated in the Tamil calendar above-named and as they were
translated. The school of the late Pandit Dayanand Saraswati, founder of
the Arya Samaj, gives a date of 1,960,852,987. See the "Arya Magazine"
of Lahore, the cover of which bears the words: "Aryan era
1,960,852,987."

\* **V**AIVASVATA Manu is the one human being -- some versions add to
him the seven Rishis -- who in the *Matsya* Avatar allegory is saved
from the Deluge in a boat, like Noah in the Ark. Therefore, this
*Vaivasvata Manvantara* would be the "post-Diluvian" period. This,
however, does not refer to the later "Atlantean" or Noah's deluge, nor
to the Cosmic *Deluge* or *Pralaya* of obscuration, which preceded our
Round, but to the appearance of mankind in the latter Round. There is a
great difference made, however, between the "*Naimitika,*" occasional or
incidental, "*Prakritika*," elemental, "*Atyantika,*" the absolute, and
"*Nitya,*" the perpetual Pralaya; the latter being described as
"Brahma's contingent recoalescence of the Universe at the end of
Brahma's **D**AY." The question was raised by a learned Brahmin
Theosophist: "Whether there is such a thing as *Cosmic* Pralaya;
because, otherwise, the *Logos* (Krishna) would have to be reborn, and
he is *Aja* (unborn)." We cannot see why. The *Logos* is said to be born
only metaphorically, as the Sun is born daily, or rather a beam of that
Sun is born in the morning and is said to die when it disappears,
whereas it is simply reabsorbed into the parent essence. Cosmic
*Pralaya* is for things visible, not for the *Arupa*, formless, world.
The Cosmic or Universal *Pralaya* comes only at the end of one hundred
years of Brahma; when the Universal dissolution is said to take place.
Then the *Avyaya,* say the exoteric scriptures, the eternal life
symbolized by Vishnu, assuming the character of Rudra, the *Destroyer,*
enters into the *Seven* Rays of the Sun and drinks up all the waters of
the Universe. "Thus fed, the seven solar Rays dilate to *seven Suns* and
set fire to the whole Cosmos. . . . ."

These are the exoteric figures accepted throughout India, and they
dovetail pretty nearly with those of the Secret works. The latter,
moreover, amplify them by a division into a number of esoteric cycles,
never mentioned in Brahmanical popular writings -- one of which, the
division of the Yugas into racial cycles, is given elsewhere as an
instance. The rest, in their details, have of course never been made
public. They are, nevertheless, known to every "*Twice-born*" (Dwija, or
Initiated) Brahmin, and the Puranas contain references to some of them
in veiled terms, which no matter-of-fact Orientalist has yet endeavoured
to make out, nor could he if he would.

These sacred astronomical cycles are of immense antiquity, and most of
them pertain, as stated, to the calculations of Narada and Asuramaya.
The latter has the reputation of a giant and a sorcerer. But the
antediluvian giants (the Gibborim of the Bible) were not all bad or
Sorcerers, as Christian Theology, which sees in every Occultist a
servant of the Evil one, would have it; nor were they worse than many of
"the faithful sons of the Church." A Torquemada and a Catherine de
Medicis certainly did more harm in their day and in the name of their
Master than any Atlantean giant or demigod of antiquity ever did;
whether his name was Cyclops, or Medusa, or yet the Orphic Titan, the
*anguipedal* monster known as Ephialtes. There were *good* "giants" in
days of old just as there are *bad* "pigmies" now; and the Rakshasas and
Yakshas of Lanka are no worse than our modern dynamiters, and certain
Christian and civilised generals during modern wars. Nor are they myths.
"He who would laugh at Briareus and Orion ought to abstain from going
to, or even talking of, Karnac or Stonehenge," remarks somewhere a
modern writer.

As the Brahmanical figures given above are approximately the basic
calculations of our esoteric system, the reader is requested to
carefully keep them in mind.

In the "*Encyclopaedia Britannica*" one finds, as the last word of
science, that the antiquity of man is allowed to stretch *only over*
"tens of thou-

------------------------------------------------------------------------

###### \[\[Vol. 2, Page\]\] 71 SCIENTIFIC SELF-COMPLACENCE.

sands of years."\* It becomes evident that as these figures may be made
to fluctuate between 10,000 and 100,000, therefore they mean very little
if anything, and only render still denser the darkness surrounding the
question. Moreover, what matters it that science places the birth of man
in the "pre- or post-glacial drift," if we are told at the same time
that the so-called "ice age" is simply a long succession of ages which
"shaded without abrupt change of any kind into what is termed the human
or Recent period . . . the overlapping of geological periods having been
the rule from the beginning of time." The latter "rule" only results in
the still more puzzling, even if strictly *scientific* and correct,
information, that "even to-day man is contemporary with the ice-age in
the Alpine valleys and in the Finmark."\*\*

Thus, had it not been for the lessons taught by the *Secret Doctrine,*
and even by exoteric Hinduism and its traditions, we should be left to
this day to float in perplexed uncertainty between the indefinite ages
of one school of science, the "tens of thousands" of years of the other,
and the 6,000 years of the Bible interpreters. This is one of the
several reasons why, with all the respect due to the conclusions of the
men of learning of our modern day, we are forced to ignore them in all
such questions of pre-historic antiquity.

Modern Geology and Anthropology must, of course, disagree with our
views. But Occultism will find as many weapons against these two
sciences as it has against astronomical and physical theories, in spite
of Mr. Laing's assurances that\*\*\* "in (chronological) calculations of
this sort, concerning older and later formations, there is no *theory,*
and they are based on positive *facts,* limited only by a certain
possible (?) amount of error either way," occultism will prove,
scientific confessions in hand, that geology is very much in error, and
very often even more so than Astronomy. In this very passage by Mr.
Laing, which gives to Geology pre-eminence for correctness over
Astronomy, we find a passage in flagrant contradiction to the admissions
of the best Geologists themselves. Says the author --

"In short, the conclusions of Geology, at any rate up to the Silurian
period,\*\*\*\* when the present order of things was fairly inaugurated,
are approximate (truly so) *facts* and not *theories,* while the
astronomical conclusions are *theories* based on *data so uncertain,*

cases they give results incredibly short . . . in others they give
results almost incredibly long."

After which, the reader is advised that the safest course "seems to be
to *assume* that Geology really proves the *duration of the present
order of things* to have been somewhere over 100 millions of years," as
"Astronomy gives an enormous though unknown time in the past, and to
come in the future, for the birth, growth, maturity, decline, and death
of the Solar System, of which our Earth is a small planet now passing
through the habitable phase." (p. 49.)

Judging from past experience, we do not entertain the slightest doubt
that, once called upon to answer "the absurd unscientific and
preposterous claims of exoteric (and esoteric) Aryan chronology," the
scientist of "the results incredibly short," *i.e.*, only 15,000,000
years, and the scientist, who "would require 600,000,000 years,"
together with those who accept Mr. Huxley's figures of 1,000,000,000
"since sedimentation began in Europe" (*World Life*)*,* would all be as
dogmatic one as the other. Nor would they fail to remind the Occultist
and the Brahmin, that it is the modern men of science alone who
represent exact science, whose duty it is to fight *inaccuracy* and
*superstition.*

The earth is passing through the "habitable phase" only for the *present
order* of things, and as far as our present mankind is concerned with
its actual "coats of skin" and phosphorus for bones and brain.

We are ready to concede the 100 millions of years offered by Geology,
since we are taught that our present physical mankind -- or the
*Vaivasvata* humanity -- began only 18 millions of years ago. But
Geology has no facts to give us for the duration of geological periods,
as we have shown, no more indeed than has Astronomy. The authentic
letter from Mr. W. Pengelly, **F.R.S**., quoted elsewhere, says that:
"It is at present, and perhaps always will be, **IMPOSSIBLE** to reduce,
even approximately, geological time into years or even into
millenniums." And having never, hitherto, excavated a fossil man of any
other than the *present form --* what does Geology know of him? It has
traced zones or strata and, with these, primordial zoological life, down
to the Silurian. When it has, in the same way, traced man down to his
primordial protoplasmic form, then we will admit that it may know
something of primordial man. If it is not very material "to the bearings
of modern scientific discovery on modern thought," whether "man has
existed in state of constant though slow progression for the last 50,000
years of period of 15 millions, or for the last 500,000 years of a
period of 150 millions" ("Modern Science, etc." p. 49), as Mr. S. Laing
tells his readers, it is very much so for the claims of the Occultists.
Unless the latter show that it is a *possibility,* if not a perfect
certainty, that man

lived 18 millions of years ago, the Secret Doctrine might as well have
remained unwritten. An attempt must, therefore, be made in this
direction, and it is our modern geologists and men of science generally
who will be brought to testify to this fact in the third part of this
volume. Meanwhile, and notwithstanding the fact that Hindu Chronology is
constantly represented by the Orientalists as a fiction based on no
"*actual* computation,"\* but simply a "childish boasting," it is
nevertbeless often twisted out of recognition to make it yield to, and
fit in with, Western theories. No figures have ever been more meddled
with and tortured than the famous 4, *3, 2,* followed by cyphers of the
Yugas and Maha-Yugas.

As the whole cycle of prehistoric events, such as the evolution and
transformation of Races and the extreme antiquity of man, hangs upon the
said Chronology, it becomes extremely important to check it by other
existing calculations. If the Eastern Chronology is rejected, we shall
at least have the consolation of proving that no other -- whether the
figures of Science or of the Churches -- is one whit more reliable. As
Professor Max Muller expresses it, it is often as useful to prove what a
thing is not as to show what it may be. And once we succeed in pointing
out the fallacies of both Christian and scientific computations -- by
allowing them a fair chance of comparison with our Chronology -- neither
of the two will have a reasonable ground to stand upon, in pronouncing
the esoteric figures less reliable than its own.

We may here refer the reader to our earlier work "*Isis Unveiled,*" Vol.
I., p. 32, for some remarks concerning the figures which were cited a
few pages back.

To-day a few more facts may be added to the information there given,
which is already known to every Orientalist. The sacredness of the cycle
of 4320, with additional cyphers, lies in the fact that the figures
which compose it, taken separately or joined in various combinations,
are each and all symbolical of the greatest mysteries in Nature. Indeed,
whether one takes the 4 separately, or the 3 by itself, or the two
together making 7, or again the three added together and yielding 9, all
these numbers have their application in the most sacred and occult
things, and record the workings of Nature in her eternally periodical
phenomena. They are never erring, perpetually recurring numbers,
unveiling, to him who studies the secrets of Nature, a truly divine
System, an *intelligent* plan in Cosmogony, which results in natural
cosmic divisions of times, seasons, invisible influences, astronomical
phenomena, with their action and reaction on terrestrial and even moral
nature; on

birth, death, and growth, on health and disease. All these natural
events are based and depend upon cyclical processes in the Kosmos
itself, producing periodic agencies which, acting from without, affect
the Earth and all that lives and breathes on it, from one end to the
other of any Manvantara. Causes and effects are esoteric, exoteric, and
*endexoteric,* so to say.

In *Isis Unveiled* we wrote that which we now repeat: -- "*We are at the
bottom of a cycle and evidently in a transitory state.* Plato divides
the intellectual progress of the universe during every cycle into
fertile and barren periods. In the sublunary regions, the spheres of the
various elements remain eternally in perfect harmony with the divine
nature, he says; 'but their parts,' owing to a too close proximity to
earth, and their commingling with the *earthly* (which is matter, and
therefore the realm of evil), 'are sometimes according, and sometimes
contrary to (divine) nature.' When those circulations -- which Eliphas
Levi calls ' currents of the astral light' -- in the universal ether
which contains in itself every element, take place in harmony with the
divine spirit, our earth and everything pertaining to it enjoys a
fertile period. The occult powers of plants, animals, and minerals
magically sympathize with the ' superior natures,' and the divine soul
of man is in perfect intelligence with these 'inferior' ones. But during
the barren periods, the latter lose their magic sympathy, and the
spiritual sight of the majority of mankind is so blinded as to lose
every notion of the superior powers of its own divine spirit. We are in
a barren period: the eighteenth century, during which the malignant
fever of scepticism broke out so irrepressibly, has entailed unbelief as
an hereditary disease upon the nineteenth. The divine intellect is
veiled in man; his animal brain alone *philosophizes.*" And
philosophizing alone, how can it understand the "**S**OUL **D**OCTRINE"?

In order not to break the thread of the narrative we shall give some
striking proofs of these cyclic laws in Part II., proceeding meanwhile
with our explanations of geological and racial cycles.
