#### ยง VII. THE DAYS AND NIGHTS OF BRAHMA.

**T**HIS is the name given to the Periods called **M**ANVANTARA
(*Manuantara*, or between the Manus) and **P**RALAYA (Dissolution); one
referring to the active periods of the Universe, the other to its times
of relative and complete *rest* -- according to whether they occur at
the end of a "Day," or an "Age" (a life) of Brahma. These periods, which
follow each other in regular succession, are also called *Kalpas*, small
and great, the minor and the *Maha Kalpa;* though, properly speaking,
the Maha Kalpa is never a "day," but a whole life or age of Brahma, for
it is said in the Brahma Vaivarta: "Chronologers compute a Kalpa by the
Life of Brahma; minor Kalpas, as Samvarta and the rest, are numerous."
In sober truth they are infinite; as they have never had a commencement,
*i.e.*, there never was a *first* Kalpa, nor will there ever be a *last*
one, in Eternity.

One *Parardha* -- in the ordinary acceptation of this measure of time --
or half of the existence of Brahma (in the present *Maha Kalpa*) has
already expired; the last Kalpa was the Padma, or that of the Golden
Lotos; the present one being *Varaha\** (the "boar" incarnation, or
*Avatar*)*.*

###### \[\[Footnote(s)\]\] -------------------------------------------------

\* There is a curious piece of information in the Buddhist esoteric
traditions. The exoteric or *allegorical* biography of Gautama Buddha
shows this great Sage dying of an indigestion of *pork and rice*, a very
prosaic end, indeed, having little of the solemn element in it. This is
explained as an allegorical reference to his having been born in the
"Boar," or Varaha-Kalpa when Brahma assumed the form of that animal to
raise the Earth out of the "Waters of Space." And as the Brahmins
descend direct from Brahma and are, so to speak, identified with him;
and as they are at the same time the mortal enemies of Buddha and
Buddhism, we have the curious allegorical hint and combination.
Brahminism (of the Boar, or *Varaha Kalpa*) has slaughtered the religion
of Buddha in India, swept it away from its face; therefore Buddha,
identified with his philosophy, is said to have died from the effects of
eating of the flesh of a wild hog. \[\[Footnote continued on next

By the scholar who studies the Hindu religion from the Puranas, one
thing is to be especially noted. He must not take literally, and in one
sense only, the statements therein found; since those which especially
concern the Manvantaras or Kalpas have to be understood in their several
references. So, for instance, these periods relate in the same language
to both the great and the small periods, to Maha Kalpas and to minor
Cycles. The *Matsya*, or Fish Avatar, happened before the Varaha or Boar
Avatar; the allegories, therefore, must relate to both the *Padma* and
the present manvantara, and also to the minor cycles which took place
since the reappearance of our Chain of Worlds and Earth. And, as the
Matsya Avatar of Vishnu and Vaivasvata's Deluge are correctly connected
with an event that happened on our Earth during this Round, it is
evident that while it may relate to pre-cosmic events (in the sense of
*our* Kosmos or Solar system) it has reference in our case to a distant
geological period. Not even Esoteric philosophy can claim to know,
except by analogical inference, that which took place before the
reappearance of our Solar System and previous to the last *Maha
Pralaya.* But it teaches distinctly that after the first geological
disturbance in the Earth's axis which ended in the sweeping down to the
bottom of the Seas of the whole second Continent, with its primeval
races -- of which successive "Earths" or Continents Atlantis was the
fourth -- there came another disturbance by the axis resuming as rapidly
its previous degree of inclination; when the Earth was indeed *raised
once more* out of the Waters, and -- as above so it is below; and *vice
versa.* There were "gods" on Earth in those days -- gods, and not men,
as we know them now, says the tradition. As will be shown in Book II.,
the computation of periods in exoteric Hinduism refers to both the great
cosmic and the small terrestrial events and cataclysms, and the same may
be shown for names. For instance Yudishthira -- the first King of the
*Sacea*, who opens the Kali Yuga era, which has to last 432,000 years --
"an actual King and man who lived 3,102 years B.C.," applies also, name
and all, to the great Deluge at the time of the first sinking of
Atlantis. He is the "Yudishthira\* born on the mountain of the hundred
peaks at the extremity of

###### \[\[Footnote(s)\]\] -------------------------------------------------

\[\[Footnote continued from previous page\]\] The idea alone of one who
established the most rigorous vegetarianism and respect for animal life
-- even to refusing to eat eggs as *vehicles of a latent future life* --
dying of a meat indigestion, is absurdly contradictory and has puzzled
more than one Orientalist. But this explanation, unveiling the allegory,
explains all the rest. The *Varaha*, however, is no simple boar, and
seems to have meant at first some antediluvian lacustrine animal
"delighting to sport in water." (*Vayu Purana.*)

\* According to Colonel Wilford, the conclusion of the "Great War" was
B.C. 1370. (*See A. R.*, *Vol.*9, *p*. 116); according to Bentley, 575
B.C.!! We may hope, perhaps, that before the end of this century, the
Mahabharatean epics will be found and proclaimed identical with the wars
of the great Napoleon.

the world *beyond which nobody can go*" and "immediately after the
flood." (*See Royal Asiat. Soc.*, *Vol.* 9, *p*. 364.) We know of no
"Flood" 3,102 years B.C. -- not even that of Noah, for, agreeably with
Judaeo-Christian chronology, it took place 2,349 years B.C.

This relates to an esoteric division of time and a mystery explained
elsewhere, and may therefore be left aside for the present. Suffice to
remark at this juncture that all the efforts of imagination of the
Wilfords, Bentleys, and other would-be OEdipuses of esoteric Hindu
Chronology have sadly failed. No computation of either the Four Ages, or
the Manvantaras, has ever been unriddled by our very learned
Orientalists, who have therefore cut the Gordian Knot by proclaiming the
whole "a figment of the Brahmanical brain." So be it, and may the great
scholars rest in peace. This "figment" is given in the Preliminary
Sections which preface *Anthropogenesis* in Book II., and with esoteric
additions.

Let us see, however, what were the three kinds of *pralayas*, and what
is the *popular* belief about them. For once it agrees with Esotericism.

Of the *pralaya* before which fourteen Manvantaras elapse, having over
them as many presiding Manus, and at whose close occurs the "incidental"
or Brahma's dissolution, it is said in *Vishnu Purana*, in condensed
form, that "at the end of a thousand periods of four ages, which
complete a day of Brahma, the earth is almost exhausted. The eternal
*Avyaya* (Vishnu) assumes then the character of Rudra (the destroyer,
Siva) and re-unites all his creatures to himself. He enters the Seven
rays of the Sun and drinks up all the waters of the globe; he causes the
moisture to evaporate, thus drying up the whole Earth. Oceans and
rivers, torrents and small streams, are all exhaled. Thus fed with
abundant moisture the seven solar rays become sevens suns by dilation,
and they finally set the world on fire. Hari, the destroyer of all
things, who is 'the flame of time, *Kalagni*,' finally consumes the
Earth. Then Rudra, becoming Janardana, breathes clouds and rain."

There are many kinds of *Pralaya*, but three chief ones are specially
mentioned in old Hindu books; and of these, as Wilson shows: -- The
first is called **N**AIMITTIKA\* "occasional" or "incidental," caused by
the intervals of "Brahma's Days;" it is the destruction of creatures, of
all that lives and has a form, but not of the substance which remains in
*statu quo* till the new DAWN in that "Night." The

###### \[\[Footnote(s)\]\] -------------------------------------------------

\* In the *Vedanta* and *Nyaya* "nimitta" (from which "Naimittika") is
rendered as the *efficient* cause, when antithesized with *upadana* the
physical or material cause. In the Sankhya *pradhana* is a cause
inferior to Brahma, or rather Brahma being himself a cause, is superior
to Pradhana. Hence "incidental" is wrongly translated, and ought to be
translated, as shown by some scholars, "Ideal" cause, and even *real*
cause would have been better.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

###### \[\[Vol. 1, Page\]\] 371 THE RE-BIRTH OF GODS.

other is called **P**RAKRITIKA -- and occurs at the end of the *Age* or
Life of Brahma, when everything that exists is resolved into the primal
element, to be remodelled at the end of that longer night. But the
third, *Atyantika*, does not concern the Worlds or the Universe, but
only the individualities of some people; it is thus individual pralaya
or NIRVANA; after having reached which, there is no more future
existence possible, no rebirth till after the *Maha Pralaya.* The latter
night, lasting as it does 311,040,000,000,000 years, and having the
possibility of being almost doubled in case the lucky *Jivanmukti*
reaches Nirvana at an early period of a Manvantara, is long enough to be
regarded as *eternal*, if not endless. The *Bhagavata* (**XII**., iv,
35) speaks of a fourth kind of pralaya, the *Nitya* or constant
dissolution, and explains it as the change which takes place
imperceptibly in everything in this Universe from the globe down to the
atom -- without cessation. It is growth and decay (life and death).

When the Maha Pralaya arrives, the inhabitants of Swar-loka (the upper
sphere) disturbed by the conflagration, seek refuge "with the Pitris,
their progenitors, the Manus, the Seven Rishis, the various orders of
celestial Spirits and the Gods, in Maharloka." When the latter is
reached also, the whole of the above enumerated beings migrate in their
turn from Maharloka, and repair to Jana-loka in "*their subtile forms*,
*destined to become re*-*embodied*, *in similar capacities as their
former*, *when the world is renewed at the beginning of the succeeding
Kalpa*;" (Vayu Purana).

" . . . . These clouds, mighty in size, and loud in thunder, fill up all
space (Nabhas-tala)," goes on Vishnu Purana. -- (Book VI., ch. iii.)
"Showering down torrents of water, these clouds quench the dreadful
fires, and then they rain uninterruptedly for a hundred (divine) years,
and deluge the whole world (Solar System). Pouring down, in drops as
large as dice, these rains overspread the earth, and fill the middle
region (*Bhuvaloka*) and inundate heaven. The world is now enveloped in
darkness, and all things animate, or inanimate, having perished, the
clouds continue to pour down their waters" . . . "and the Night of
Brahma reigns supreme over the scene of desolation . . . . ."

This is what we call in the Esoteric Doctrine a "Solar Pralaya" . . .
When the waters have reached the region of the Seven Rishis, and the
world (our Solar System) is one ocean, they stop. The breath of Vishnu
becomes a strong wind, which blows for another hundred (divine) years
until all clouds are dispersed. The wind is then reabsorbed: and
"**T**HAT, of which all things are made, the Lord by whom all things
exist, He who is inconceivable, without beginning, the beginning of the
universe, reposes, sleeping upon Sesha (the Serpent of Infinity) in the
midst of the deep. The *Adikrit*

(Creator?) *Hari*, sleeps upon the ocean of Space in the form of Brahma
-- glorified by Sanaka\* and the *Siddha* (Saints) of Jana-loka, and
contemplated by the holy denizens of Brahma-loka, anxious for final
liberation, involved in mystic slumber, the celestial personification of
his own illusions. . . ." This is the *Pratisanchara* (dissolution?)
termed incidental because *Hari* is its incidental (ideal) Cause. . . .
.\*\* When the Universal Spirit wakes, the world revives; when he closes
his eyes, all things fall upon the bed of mystic slumber. In like
manner, as 1,000 great ages constitute a Day of Brahma (in the original
it is Padma-yoni, the same as *Abjayoni* -- "lotos-born," not Brahma),
so his Night consists of the same period. "Awaking at the end of his
night, the unborn . . . creates the Universe anew. . . *.*" (*Vishnu
Purana.*)

This is "incidental" pralaya; what is the Elemental Dissolution? "When
by dearth and fire," says Parasara to Maitreya, "all the worlds and
Patalas (hells) are withered up . . .\*\*\* the progress of elemental
dissolution is begun. Then, first the waters swallow up the property of
Earth (which is the rudiment of smell), and earth deprived of this
property proceeds to destruction -- and becomes one with water . . . .
when the Universe is thus pervaded by the waves of the watery Element,
its rudimentary flavour is locked up by the elements of fire . . . on
account of which the waters themselves are destroyed . . . and become
one with fire; and the Universe is therefore, entirely filled with flame
(ethereal) which gradually overspreads the whole world. While Space is
one flame, the element of wind seizes upon the rudimental property or
form, which is the cause of light, and that being withdrawn (*pralina*)
all becomes of the nature of air. The rudiment of form being destroyed,
and *Vibhavasu* (fire?) deprived of its rudiment, air extinguishes fire
and spreads over space, which is deprived of light when fire merges into
air. Air, then, accompanied by sound, which is the source of Ether,
extends everywhere throughout the ten regions . . . . until Ether seizes
upon cohesion (*Sparsa* -- Touch?) its rudimental property, by the loss
of which, air is destroyed, and KHA remains unmodified; devoid of form,
flavour, touch (*Sparsa*), and smell, it exists, embodied (*murttimat*)
and vast, and pervades the whole Space. Akasa, whose characteristic
property and rudiment is sound (the "Word"), occupies the whole
containment of Space. Then the origin (Noumenon?) of the Elements
(*Bhutadi*), devours sound (collective *Demiurgos*); and the hosts of
Dhyan Chohans, and all the existing

Elements\* are at once merged into their original. The primary Element,
Consciousness, combined with *tamasa* (spiritual darkness) is itself
disintegrated by MAHAT (the Universal Intellect), whose characteristic
property is *Buddhi*, and earth and Mahat are the inner and outer
boundaries of the Universe." Thus as (in the beginning) "were the seven
forms of Prakriti (nature) reckoned from Mahat to earth, so *these
seven* successively re-enter into each other."\*\*

"The Egg of Brahma (*Sarva*-*mandala*) is dissolved in the waters that
surround it, with its seven zones (*dwipas*) seven oceans, seven
regions, and their mountains; the investure of water is drunk by the
fire; the (*stratum* of) fire is absorbed by (that of) air; air blends
itself with ether (Akasa); the *Bhutadi* (the origin, or rather the
*cause*, of the primary element) devours the ether and is (itself)
destroyed by Mahat (the Great, the Universal mind), which along with all
these is seized upon by Prakriti and disappears. The Prakriti is
essentially the same, whether discrete or indiscrete; only that which is
discrete is finally absorbed by and lost in the indiscrete. **P**UMS
(*Spirit*) also, which is one, pure, imperishable, eternal,
all-pervading, is a portion of that Supreme spirit which is all things.
That Spirit (*Sarvesa*) which is other than (embodied) Spirit, and in
which there are no attributes of name, species (*naman* and *jati*, *or
rupa*, hence body rather than species), or the like -- remains as the
sole existence (**S**ATTA). . . Prakriti and Purusha both resolving
finally into **S**UPREME **S**PIRIT. . . ." (*From Vishnu Purana*,
Wilson's mistakes being here corrected, and original words put in
brackets).

This is the final **P**RALAYA\*\*\* -- the Death of Kosmos -- after
which its Spirit rests in Nirvana, or in **T**HAT for which there is
neither Day nor Night. All the other pralayas are periodical and follow,
in regular succession, the Manvantaras, as the night follows the day of
every human creature, animal, and plant. The cycle of creation of the
*lives* of Kosmos is run down, the energy of the manifested "Word"
having

###### \[\[Footnote(s)\]\] -------------------------------------------------

\* The term "Elements" must be understood here to mean not only the
visible and physical Elements, but also that which St. Paul calls
Elements -- the spiritual, intelligent Potencies -- Angels and Demons in
their Manvantaric form.

\*\* When this description is correctly understood by Orientalists in
its esoteric significance then it will be found that this Cosmic
correlation of World-Elements may explain the correlation of physical
forces better than those now known. At any rate, theosophists will
perceive that Prakriti has *seven forms*, or principles, "reckoned from
Mahat to Earth." The "Waters" mean here the Mystic "mother"; the Womb of
abstract nature, in which the manifested Universe is conceived. The
Seven "zones" have reference to the Seven Divisions of that Universe, or
the Noumena of the Forces that bring it into being. It is all
allegorical.

\*\*\* As it is the *Maha*, the Great, or so-called final **P**RALAYA
which is here described, every thing is re-absorbed into its original
ONE Element -- the "Gods themselves, Brahma and the rest" being said to
die and disappear during that long NIGHT.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

###### \[\[Vol. 1, Page\]\] 374 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.

its growth, culmination, and decrease, as have all things temporary,
however long their duration. The Creative Force is Eternal as Noumenon;
as a phenomenal manifestation in its aspects, it has a *beginning* and
must, therefore, have an end. During that interval it has its periods of
activity and its periods of rest. And these are the "Days and the nights
of Brahma." But Brahma, the Noumenon, never rests, as IT never changes
and ever IS, though IT cannot be said to be anywhere. . . . .

The Jewish Kabalists felt this necessity of *immutability* in an
eternal, infinite Deity, and therefore applied the same thought to the
anthropomorphic god. The idea is poetical and very appropriate in its
application. In the *Zohar* we read as follows: --

"As Moses was keeping a vigil on Mount Sinai, in company with the deity,
who was concealed from his sight by a cloud, he felt a great fear
overcome him, and suddenly asked: 'Lord, where art thou . . . . sleepest
thou, O Lord? . . .' And the *Spirit* answered him: 'I never sleep: were
I to fall asleep for a moment BEFORE MY TIME, all the creation would
crumble into dissolution in one instant.' "

"*Before my time*" is very suggestive. It shows the God of Moses to be
only a temporary substitute, like Brahma the male, a substitute and an
aspect of THAT which is immutable, and which therefore can take no part
in the "days," or in the "nights," nor have any concern whatever with
reaction or dissolution.

While the Eastern Occultists have seven modes of interpretation, the
Jews have only four -- namely, the real-mystical; the allegorical; the
moral; and the literal or *Pashut.* The latter is the key of the
exoteric Churches and not worth discussion. Read in the first, or
mystical key, here are several sentences which show the identity of the
foundations of construction in every Scripture. It is given in Mr. T.
Myer's excellent book on the Kabalistic works he seems to have well
studied. I quote *verbatim.* "*B*'*raisheeth barah elohim ath hash ama
yem v*'*ath haa*'*retz* -- *i.e.*, 'In the beginning the God(s) created
the heavens and the earth;" (the meaning of which is:) the six Sephiroth
of Construction,\* over which B'raisheeth stands, *all belong Below.* It
created six (and) on these stand all Things. And those depend upon *the
seven forms of the Cranium* up to the Dignity of all Dignities. And the
second 'Earth' does not come into calculation, therefore it has been
said: 'And from it (that Earth) which underwent the curse, came it
forth.' . . . . 'It (the Earth) was without form and void; and darkness
was over the face of the Abyss, and the Spirit of elohim . . . . was
breathing (*me*' *racha* '*phath*) -- *i.e.*, hovering, brooding over,
moving. . . . . Thirteen depend on thirteen

(forms) of the most worthy Dignity. Six thousand years hang (are
referred to) in the first six words. The seventh (thousand, the
millennium) above it (the cursed Earth) is that which is strong by
Itself. And it was rendered entirely desolate during twelve hours (one .
. . . Day) as is written. . . . . In the thirteenth, It (the Deity)
shall restore all . . . . and everything shall be renewed as before; and
all those six shall continue . . . . etc*.*" (*Qabbalah*, p. 233, from
*Siphrah Dzeniuta*, c. i., ยง 16, *s*. 9.)

The "Sephiroth of Construction" are the six Dhyan Chohans, or Manus, or
Prajapati, synthesized by the seventh "B'raisheeth (the First Emanation
or *Logos*), and who are called, therefore, the Builders of the Lower or
physical Universe" all belong Below. These *six* ![](sd1-375.gif) whose
essence is *of the Seventh* -- are the *Upadhi*, the base or fundamental
stone on which the objective Universe is built, the *noumenoi* of all
things. Hence they are, at the same time, the Forces of nature, the
Seven Angels of the Presence, the sixth and seventh principles in man;
the spirito-psycho-physical spheres of the Septenary chain, the Root
Races, etc., etc. They all "depend upon the Seven forms of the Cranium"
up to the highest. The "*second* Earth" "does not come into calculation"
because it is *no Earth*, but the Chaos or Abyss of Space in which
rested the paradigmatic, or model universe in ideation of the OVER-SOUL
brooding over it. The term "Curse" is here very misleading, for it means
simply *doom* or *destiny*, or *that fatality which sent it forth* into
the objective state. This is shown by that "Earth" under the "Curse"
being described as "without form and void," in whose abysmal depths the
"Breath" of the Elohim (collective Logoi) produced or photographed the
first divine **I**DEATION *of the things to be.* This process is
repeated after every *Pralaya* before the beginnings of a new
Manvantara, or period of sentient individual being. "Thirteen depend on
thirteen forms," refers to the thirteen periods personified by the
thirteen Manus, with Swayambhuva the fourteenth (13, instead of 14,
being an additional *veil*): those fourteen Manus who reign within the
term of a Mahayuga, a "Day" of Brahma. These (thirteen-fourteen) of the
objective Universe depend on the thirteen (fourteen) *paradigmatic*,
*ideal* forms. The meaning of the "Six thousand *years*" which "hang in
the first six words," has again to be sought in the Indian Wisdom. They
refer to the primordial six (seven) "Kings of Edom" who typify the
worlds (or spheres) of our chain during the first Round, as well as the
primordial men of this Round. They are the septenary *pre*-*Adamic* (or
before the Third, *Separated* Race) first Root-race. As they were
*shadows*, and senseless (they had not eaten yet of the fruit of the
Tree of Knowledge), they could not see the

------------------------------------------------------------------------

###### \[\[Vol. 1, Page\]\] 376 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.

*Parguphim*, or "Face could not see Face" (primeval men were
unconscious), "therefore, the primordial (seven) Kings died," *i.e.*,
were destroyed (*vide Sepherah Djenioutha*)*.* Now, who are they? They
are the Kings who are "the Seven Rishis, certain (secondary) divinities,
Sakra (Indra), Manu, and the Kings his Sons, who *are created and perish
at one period*," as said in Vishnu Purana (Book I. chap. iii.). For the
seventh ("thousand") (*not the millennium of exoteric Christianity*,
*but that of Anthropogenesis*) represents both the "seventh period of
creation," that of physical man (Vishnu Purana), and the seventh
Principle -- both macrocosmic and microcosmic, -- as also the *pralaya*
after the Seventh period, the "Night" which has the same duration as the
"Day" of Brahma. "It was rendered entirely desolate during twelve hours,
as is written." It is in the Thirteenth (twice six and the Synthesis)
that everything shall be restored "and the *six* will continue."

Thus the author of the *Qabbalah* remarks quite truly that "Long before
his (Ibn Gebirol's) time . . . many centuries before the Christian era,
there was in Central Asia a 'Wisdom Religion;' fragments of which
subsequently existed among the learned men of the archaic Egyptians, the
ancient Chinese, Hindus, etc. . . ." and that . . . . . "The Qabbalah
most likely originally came from Aryan sources, through Central Asia,
Persia, India and Mesopotamia, for from Ur and Haran came Abraham and
many others into Palestine" (p. 221). And such was the firm conviction
of C. W. King, the author of "The Gnostics and their Remains."

Vamadeva Modelyar (*Modely*) describes the coming "night" most
poetically. Though it is given in *Isis Unveiled*, it is worthy of
repetition.

"Strange noises are heard, proceeding from every point . . . These are
the precursors of the Night of Brahma; *dusk rises at the horizon*, and
the Sun passes away behind the thirteenth degree of Macara (sign of the
Zodiac), and will reach no more the sign of the *Minas* (zodiacal
*pisces*, or fish). The gurus of the pagodas appointed to watch the
*rasichakr* (Zodiac), may now break their circle and instruments, for
they are henceforth useless.

"Gradually light pales, heat diminishes, uninhabited spots multiply on
the earth, the air becomes more and more rarified; the springs of waters
dry up, the great rivers see their waves exhausted, the ocean shows its
sandy bottom and plants die. Men and animals decrease in size daily.
Life and motion lose their force, planets can hardly gravitate in space;
they are extinguished one by one, like a lamp which the hand of the
chokra (servant) neglects to replenish. Surya (the Sun) flickers and
goes out, matter falls into dissolution (pralaya), and Brahma merges
back into Dayus, the Unrevealed God, and, his task being

accomplished, he falls asleep. Another day is passed, night sets in, and
continues until the future dawn.

"And now again he re-enters into the golden egg of His Thought, the
germs of all that exist, as the divine Manu tells us. During His
peaceful rest, the animated beings, endowed with the principles of
action, cease their functions, and all feeling (manas) becomes dormant.
When they are all absorbed in the **S**UPREME **S**OUL, this Soul of all
the beings sleeps in complete repose till the day when it resumes its
form, and awakes again from its primitive darkness."\*

As the "*Satya*-*yuga*" is always the first in the series of the four
ages or Yugas, so the Kali ever comes the last. The *Kali yuga* reigns
now supreme in India, and it seems to coincide with that of the Western
age. Anyhow, it is curious to see how prophetic in almost all things was
the writer of Vishnu Purana when foretelling to Maitreya some of the
dark influences and sins of this Kali Yug. For after saying that the
"barbarians" will be masters of the banks of the Indus, of Chandrabhaga
and Kasmera, he adds:

"There will be contemporary monarchs, reigning over the earth -- kings
of churlish spirit, violent temper, and ever addicted to falsehood and
wickedness. They will inflict death on women, children, and cows; they
will seize upon the property of their subjects, and *be intent upon the
wives of others;* they will be of unlimited power, their lives will be
short, their desires insatiable. . . . People of various countries
intermingling with them, will follow their example; and the barbarians
being powerful (in India) in the patronage of the princes, while purer
tribes are neglected, the people will perish (or, as the Commentator has
it, 'The Mlechchhas will be in the centre and the Aryas in the
end.')\*\* Wealth and piety will decrease until the world will be wholly
depraved. Property alone will confer rank; wealth will be the only
source of devotion; passion will be the sole bond of union between the
sexes; falsehood will be the only means of success in litigation; and
women will be objects merely of sensual gratification. . . . . .
*External types will be the only distinction of the several orders of
life;* . . . . . a man if rich will be reputed pure; dishonesty
(*anyaya*) *will* be the universal means of subsistence, weakness the
cause of dependence, menace and presumption will be substituted for
learning; liberality will be devotion; mutual assent, marriage; fine
clothes, dignity. He who is the strongest will reign; the people, unable
to bear the heavy burthen, *Khara bhara* (the load of taxes) will take
refuge among the valleys. . . . Thus, in the Kali age will decay

the human race approaches its annihilation (pralaya) . . . . When the
close of the Kali age shall be nigh, a portion of that divine being
which exists, of its own spiritual nature . . . shall descend on Earth .
. . (*Kalki Avatar*) endowed with the eight superhuman faculties. . . .
He will re-establish righteousness on earth, and the minds of those who
live at the end of Kali Yuga shall be awakened and become as pellucid as
crystal. The men who are thus changed . . . *shall be the seeds of human
beings*, and shall give birth to a race who shall follow the laws of the
Krita age, the age of purity. As it is said, 'When the sun and moon and
the lunar asterism Tishya and the planet Jupiter are in one mansion, the
Krita (or Satya) age shall return.' "

". . . . Two persons, Devapi, of the race of Kuru and Moru, of the
family of Ikshwaku, continue alive throughout the four ages, residing at
Kalapa.\* They will return hither in the beginning of the Krita age . .
. Moru\*\* the son of Sighru through the power of Yoga is still living .
. . . and will be the restorer of the Kshattriya race of the Solar
dynasty."\*\*\* (*Vayu Purana*, Vol. III, *p*. 197).

Whether right or wrong with regard to the latter prophecy, the
*blessings* of Kali Yuga are well described, and fit in admirably even
with that which one sees and hears in Europe and other civilized and
Christian lands in full XIXth, and at the dawn of the XXth century of
our great era of **E**NLIGHTENMENT.

\* Matsya Purana gives Katapa.

\*\* Max Muller translates the name as Morya, of the Morya dynasty, to
which Chandragupta belonged (see Sanscrit Literature). In Matsya Purana,
chapter cclxxii, the dynasty of ten Moryas (or Maureyas) is spoken of.
In the same chapter, cclxxii, it is stated that the Moryas will one day
reign over India, after restoring the Kshattriya race many thousand
years hence. Only that reign will be purely Spiritual and "not of this
world." It will be the kingdom of the next Avatar. Colonel Tod believes
the name Morya (or *Maureyas*) a corruption of Mori, a Rajpoot tribe,
and the commentary on Mahavansa thinks that some princes have taken
their name Maurya from their town called Mori, or, as Professor Max
Muller gives it, Morya-Nagara, which is more correct, after the original
Mahavansa. Vachaspattya, we are informed by our Brother, Devan Badhadur
R. Ragoonath Rao, of Madras, a Sanscrit Encyclopedia, places Katapa
(Kalapa) on the northern side of the Himalayas, hence in Tibet. The same
is stated in chapter xii. (Skanda) of Bhagavat, Vol. III, p. 325.

\*\*\* The Vayu Purana declares that Moru will re-establish the
Kshattriya in the Nineteenth coming Yuga. (*See* "*Five years of
Theosophy*," *p.* 483*.* "*The Moryas and Koothoomi.*")
