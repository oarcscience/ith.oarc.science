CYCLIC EVOLUTION AND KARMA.</H4>

<P>
<STRONG>I</STRONG>T is the Spiritual evolution of the <EM>inner</EM>,<EM>
</EM>immortal man that forms the fundamental tenet in the Occult
Sciences. To realize even distantly such a process, the student
has to believe (<EM>a</EM>) in the ONE Universal Life, independent
of matter (or what Science regards as matter); and (<EM>b</EM>)
in the individual intelligences that animate the various manifestations
of this Principle. Mr. Huxley does not believe in &quot;Vital
Force,&quot; others do. Dr. J. H. Hutchinson Sterling's work &quot;Concerning
Protoplasm&quot; has made no small havoc of this dogmatic negation.
Professor Beale's decision is also in favour of a Vital Principle;
and Dr. B. W. Richardson's lectures on the &quot;Nervous Ether,&quot;
have been sufficiently quoted from. Thus, opinions are divided.
<P>
The ONE LIFE is closely related to <EM>the one </EM>law which
governs the World of Being -- <STRONG>K</STRONG>ARMA. Exoterically,
this is simply and literally &quot;action,&quot; or rather an
&quot;effect-producing cause.&quot; Esoterically it is quite a
different thing in its far-fetching moral effects. It is the unerring
<STRONG>L</STRONG>AW OF <STRONG>R</STRONG>ETRIBUTION. To say to
those ignorant of the real significance, characteristics and awful
importance of this eternal immutable law, that no theological
definition of a personal deity can give an idea of this impersonal,
yet ever present and active Principle, is to speak in vain. Nor
can it be called Providence. For Providence, with the Theists
(the Christian Protestants, at any rate), rejoices in a personal
male gender, while with the Roman Catholics it is a female potency,
&quot;Divine Providence tempers His blessings to secure their
better effects,&quot; Wogan tells us. Indeed &quot;He&quot; tempers
them, which Karma -- a sexless principle -- does not.
<P>
Throughout the first two Parts, it was shown that, at the first
flutter<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 635 THE ROOTS AND CAUSES.</H6>

<P>
of renascent life, Svabhavat, &quot;the mutable radiance of the
Immutable Darkness unconscious in Eternity,&quot; passes, at every
new rebirth of Kosmos, from an inactive state into one of intense
activity; that it differentiates, and then begins its work through
that differentiation. This work is <STRONG>K</STRONG>ARMA.
<P>
The Cycles are also subservient to the effects produced by this
activity. &quot;The one Cosmic atom becomes seven atoms on the
plane of matter, and each is transformed into a centre of energy;
that same atom becomes seven rays on the plane of spirit, and
the seven creative forces of nature, radiating from the root-essence
. . . . follow, one the right, the other the left path, separate
till the end of the Kalpa, and yet are in close embrace. What
unites them? <STRONG>K</STRONG>ARMA.&quot; The atoms emanated
from the Central Point emanate in their turn new centres of energy,
which, under the potential breath of <EM>Fohat</EM>,<EM> </EM>begin
their work from within without, and multiply other minor centres.
These, in the course of evolution and involution, form in their
turn the roots or developing causes of new effects, from worlds
and &quot;man-bearing&quot; globes, down to the genera, species,
and classes of all the <EM>seven </EM>kingdoms* (of which <EM>we
know only four</EM>)<EM>. </EM>For &quot;the blessed workers have
received the <EM>Thyan</EM>-<EM>kam</EM>,<EM> </EM>in the eternity&quot;
(Book of &quot;The Aphorisms of <EM>Tson</EM>-<EM>ka</EM>-<EM>pa</EM>&quot;)<EM>.</EM>

<P>
&quot;Thyan-kam&quot; is the power or knowledge of guiding the
impulses of cosmic energy in the right direction.
<P>
The true Buddhist, recognising no &quot;personal god,&quot; nor
any &quot;Father&quot; and<EM> </EM>&quot;<EM>Creator </EM>of
Heaven and Earth,&quot; still believes in an <EM>absolute consciousness</EM>,<EM>
</EM>&quot;Adi-Buddhi&quot;; and the Buddhist philosopher <EM>knows
</EM>that there are Planetary Spirits, the &quot;Dhyan Chohans.&quot;
But though he admits of &quot;spiritual lives,&quot; yet, as they
are temporary in eternity, even they, according to his philosophy,
are &quot;the <EM>maya </EM>of the <EM>day</EM>,&quot; the<EM>
illusion </EM>of a &quot;day of Brahma,&quot; a short manvantara
of 4,320,000,000 years. The &quot;Yin-Sin&quot; is not for the
speculations of men, for the Lord Buddha has strongly prohibited
all such inquiry. If the Dhyan Chohans and all the invisible Beings
-- the <EM>Seven </EM>Centres and their direct Emanations, the
<EM>minor </EM>centres of Energy -- are the direct reflex of the
<STRONG>O</STRONG>NE Light, yet men are far removed from these,
since the whole of the <EM>visible </EM>Kosmos consists of &quot;<EM>self</EM>-<EM>produced
</EM>beings, the creatures of <EM>Karma.</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>Thus
regarding a personal God &quot;as only a gigantic shadow thrown
upon the void of space by the imagination of ignorant men,&quot;**
they teach that only &quot;two things are (objectively) eternal,
namely <EM>Akasa </EM>and<EM> Nirvana</EM>&quot;;<EM> </EM>and
that these are ONE in reality, and but a <EM>maya </EM>when divided.
&quot;Buddhists deny creation and cannot conceive of a <EM>Creator.</EM>&quot;<EM>

**<EM> Buddhist Catechism</EM>,<EM> </EM>by H. S. Olcott, President
of the Theosophical Society.<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 636 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</H6>

<P>
on our earth) in obedience to a law of motion inherent in it,
and after a certain existence passes away. Nothing ever came out
of nothing.&quot; (<EM>Buddhist Catechism.</EM>)
<P>
If a Vedantic Brahmin of the Adwaita Sect, when asked whether
he believes in the existence of God, is always likely to answer,
as Jacolliot was answered -- &quot;I am myself 'God';&quot; a
Buddhist (a Sinhalese especially) would simply laugh, and say
in reply, &quot;There is no God; no Creation.&quot; Yet the root
philosophy of both Adwaita and Buddhist scholars is <EM>identical</EM>,<EM>
</EM>and both have the same respect for animal life, for both
believe that every creature on earth, however small and humble,
&quot;is an immortal portion of the immortal matter&quot; -- for
matter with them has quite another significance than it has with
either Christian or materialist -- and that every creature is
subject to Karma.
<P>
The answer of the Brahmin is one which would suggest itself to
every ancient philosopher, Kabalist, and Gnostic of the early
days. It contains the very spirit of the Delphic and Kabalistic
commandments, for esoteric philosophy solved, ages ago, the problem
of what man <EM>was</EM>,<EM> is</EM>,<EM> </EM>and <EM>will be;
</EM>of man's origin, life-cycle -- interminable in its duration
of successive incarnations or rebirths -- and finally of his absorption
into the source from which he started.
<P>
But it is not physical Science that we can ever ask to read man
for us, as the riddle of the Past, or that of the Future; since
no philosopher is able to tell us even what man is, as he is known
both to physiology and psychology. In doubt whether man was &quot;a
god or beast,&quot; he is now connected with the latter and derived
from an animal. No doubt that the care of analyzing and classifying
the human being as a <EM>terrestrial animal </EM>may be left to
Science, which occultists -- of all men -- regard with veneration
and respect. They recognize its ground and the wonderful work
done by it, the progress achieved in physiology, and even -- to
a degree -- in biology. But man's <EM>inner</EM>,<EM> </EM>spiritual,
psychic, or even moral, nature cannot be left to the tender mercies
of an ingrained materialism; for not even the higher psychological
philosophy of the West is able, in its present incompleteness
and tendency towards a decided agnosticism, to do justice to the
inner; especially to his higher capacities and perceptions, and
those states of consciousness, across the road to which such authorities
as Mill draw a strong line, saying &quot;So far, and no farther
shalt thou go.&quot;
<P>
No Occultist would deny that man -- no less than the elephant
and the microbe, the crocodile and the lizard, the blade of grass
or the crystal -- is, in his physical formation, the simple product
of the evolutionary forces of nature through a numberless series
of transformations; but he puts the case differently.
<P>
It is not against zoological and anthropological discoveries,
based on<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 637 THE SWING OF KARMA.</H6>

<P>
the fossils of man and animal, that every mystic and believer
in a divine soul inwardly revolts, but only against the uncalled-for
conclusions built on preconceived theories and made to fit in
with certain prejudices. Their premises may or may not be always
true; and as some of these theories live but a short life, the
deductions therefrom must ever be one-sided with materialistic
evolutionists. Yet it is on the strength of such very ephemeral
authority, that most of the men of science frequently receive
undue honours where they deserve them the least.*
<P>
To make the working of Karma, in the periodical renovations of
the Universe, more evident and intelligible to the student when
he arrives at the origin and evolution of man, he has now to examine
with us the esoteric bearing of the Karmic Cycles upon Universal
Ethics. The question is, do those mysterious divisions of time,
called Yugas and Kalpas by the Hindus, and so very graphically
-- [[<EM>Kuklos</EM>]] -- &quot;cycle,&quot; ring or circle, by
the Greeks, have any bearing upon, or any direct connection with,
human life? Even exoteric philosophy explains that these perpetual
circles of time are ever returning on themselves, periodically,
and
<H6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
</H6>

<P>
* We refer those who would regard the statement as an impertinence
or <EM>irreverence </EM>against accepted Science, to Mr. James
Hutchinson Stirling's work concerning &quot;Protoplasm,&quot;
which is a defence of a <EM>vital</EM> Principle <EM>versus </EM>the
Molecularists -- Huxley, Tyndall, Vogt, and Co. -- and request
them to examine whether it is true or not to say that the scientific
premises may not be always correct, but that they are accepted,
nevertheless, to fill up a gap or a hole in some beloved materialistic
hobby. Speaking of protoplasm and the organs of man, as &quot;viewed
by Mr. Huxley,&quot; the author says: &quot;Probably then, in
regard to any continuity in protoplasm of power, of form, or of
substance, we have seen <EM>lacunae</EM> enow. Nay, Mr. Huxley
himself can be adduced in evidence on the same side. <EM>Not rarely
do we find in his essay admissions </EM>of PROBABILITY, <EM>where
it is </EM>CERTAINTY <EM>that is alone in place. </EM>He says,
for example: 'It is more than probable that <EM>when</EM> the
vegetable world is thoroughly explored we <EM>shall </EM>find
all plants in possession of the same powers.' When <EM>a conclusion
is decidedly announced</EM>,<EM> </EM>it is rather disappointing
to be told, as here, that <EM>the premisses are still to collect</EM>'<EM>
(!!)</EM> . . . . . Again, here is a passage in which he is seen
to cut his own '<EM>basis</EM>'<EM> </EM>from beneath his own
feet. After telling us that all forms of protoplasm consist of
carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen 'in very complex union,'
he continues: 'To this complex combination, <EM>the nature of
which has never been determined with exactness (!!)</EM>, the
name of <EM>protein </EM>has been applied.' This, plainly, is
an identification, on Mr. Huxley's own part, of protoplasm and
protein; and what is said of one, being necessarily true of the
other, it follows that he admits the nature of protoplasm never
to have been determined with exactness, and that even in his eyes
the <EM>lis </EM>is still <EM>sub judice. </EM>This admission
is strengthened by the words, too, 'If we use this term -- <EM>protein
</EM>--<EM> </EM>with such <EM>caution </EM>as may properly arise
out of our <EM>comparative ignorance </EM>of the things for which
it stands . . . etc., etc. (p. 33 and 34, in reply to Mr. Huxley
in &quot;Yeast&quot;).
<P>
This is the eminent Huxley, the king of physiology and biology,
who is proven playing at blind man's buff with <EM>premisses </EM>and<EM>
facts. </EM>What may not the &quot;smaller fry&quot; of science
do after this!<HR>

<P>
intelligently in Space and Eternity. There are &quot;Cycles of
matter&quot;* and there are &quot;Cycles of Spiritual evolution.&quot;
Racial, national, and individual cycles. May not esoteric speculation
allow us a still deeper insight into the workings of these?
<P>
This idea is beautifully expressed in a very clever scientific
work: --
<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;The possibility of rising to a comprehension of a system
of co-ordination so far outreaching in time and space all reach
of human observations, is a circumstance which signalizes the
power of man to transcend the limitations of changing and inconsistent
matter, and assert his superiority over all unstable and perishable
forms of being. <I>There is a method in the succession of events</I>,<I>
</I>and in the relation of co-existent things, which the mind
of man seizes hold of; and by means of this as a clue, he runs
back or forward over aeons of material history of which human
experience can never testify. Events germinate and unfold. They
have a past which is connected with their present, and we feel
a well-justified confidence that a future is appointed which will
be similarly connected with the present and the past. This continuity
and unity of history repeat themselves before our eyes in all
conceivable stages of progress. The phenomena furnish us the grounds
for the generalization of two laws which are truly <I>principles
of scientific divination</I>,<I> </I>by which alone the human
mind penetrates the sealed records of the past and the unopened
pages of the future. The first of these is the law of evolution,
or, to phrase it for our purpose, <I>the law of correlated successiveness
or organized history in the individual</I>,<I> </I>illustrated
in the changing phases of every single maturing system of results.
. . . These thoughts summon into our immediate presence the measureless
past and the measureless future of material history. They seem
almost to open vistas through infinity, and to endow the human
intellect with an existence and a vision exempt from the limitations
of time and space and finite causation, and lift it up toward
a sublime apprehension of the Supreme Intelligence whose dwelling
place is Eternity.&quot; (&quot;World-Life,&quot; p. 535 and 548.)
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
According to the teachings, Maya, or the illusive appearance of
the marshalling of events and actions on this earth, changes,
varying with nations and places. But the chief features of one's
life are always in accordance with the &quot;Constellation&quot;
one is born under, or, we should say, with the characteristics
of its animating principle or the deity that presides over it,
whether we call it a <EM>Dhyan Chohan</EM>,<EM> </EM>as in Asia,
or an Archangel, as with the Greek and Latin churches. In ancient
Symbolism it was always the <STRONG>S</STRONG>UN (though the Spiritual,
not the visible, Sun was meant), that was supposed to send forth
the chief Saviours and Avatars. Hence the connecting link between
the Buddhas, the Avatars, and so many other incarnations of the
highest <STRONG>S</STRONG>EVEN. The closer the approach to one's<EM>
Prototype</EM>,<EM> </EM>&quot;in Heaven,&quot; the better for
the mortal whose personality was chosen, by his own <EM>personal
</EM>deity (the seventh principle), as its terrestrial abode.

<P>
with that &quot;Self-god,&quot; one of the lower rays breaks and
the spiritual entity of man is drawn higher and ever higher to
the ray that supersedes the first, until, from ray to ray, the
inner man is drawn into the one and highest beam of the Parent-<STRONG>S</STRONG>UN.
Thus, &quot;the events of humanity <EM>do </EM>run coordinately
with the number forms,&quot; since the single units of that humanity
proceed one and all from the same source -- the <EM>central</EM>
and its <EM>shadow</EM>,<EM> </EM>the visible <STRONG>S</STRONG>UN.
For the equinoxes and solstices, the periods and various phases
of the Solar course, astronomically and numerically expressed,
are only the concrete symbols of the eternally living verity,
though they do seem <EM>abstract ideas </EM>to uninitiated mortals.
And this explains the extraordinary numerical coincidences with
geometrical relations, as shown by several authors.
<P>
Yes; &quot;our destiny <EM>is </EM>written in the stars!&quot;
Only, the closer the union between the mortal reflection MAN and
his celestial PROTOTYPE, the less dangerous the external conditions
and subsequent reincarnations -- which neither Buddhas nor Christs
can escape. This is not superstition, least of all is it <EM>Fatalism.
</EM>The latter implies a blind course of some still blinder power,
and man is a free agent during his stay on earth. He cannot escape
his <EM>ruling </EM>Destiny, but he has the choice of two paths
that lead him in that direction, and he can reach the goal of
misery -- if such is decreed to him, either in the snowy white
robes of the Martyr, or in the soiled garments of a volunteer
in the iniquitous course; for, there are <EM>external and internal
conditions </EM>which affect the determination of our will upon
our actions, and it is in our power to follow either of the two.
Those who believe in <EM>Karma </EM>have to believe in<EM> destiny</EM>,<EM>
</EM>which, from birth to death, every man is weaving thread by
thread around himself, as a spider does his cobweb; and this destiny
is guided either by the heavenly voice of the invisible <EM>prototype</EM>
outside of us, or by our more intimate <EM>astral</EM>,<EM> </EM>or
inner man, who is but too often the evil genius of the embodied
entity called man. Both these lead on the outward man, but one
of them must prevail; and from the very beginning of the invisible
affray the stern and implacable <EM>law of compensation </EM>steps
in and takes its course, faithfully following the fluctuations.
When the last strand is woven, and man is seemingly enwrapped
in the net-work of his own doing, then he finds himself completely
under the empire of this <EM>self</EM>-<EM>made </EM>destiny.
It then either fixes him like the inert shell against the immovable
rock, or carries him away like a feather in a whirlwind raised
by his own actions, and this is -- <STRONG>K</STRONG>ARMA.
<P>
A materialist, treating upon the periodical creations of our globe,
has expressed it in one sentence. &quot;The whole <EM>past </EM>of
the Earth is nothing but an unfolded <EM>present.</EM>&quot;<EM>
</EM>This was Buchner, who little suspected that he was repeating
an axiom of the Occultists. It is quite true also, as Burmeister
(quoted in &quot;<EM>Force and matter</EM>&quot;)<EM> </EM>remarks,
that<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 640 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</H6>

<P>
&quot;the historical investigation of the development of the Earth
has proved that <EM>now and then </EM>rest upon the same base;
that the past has been developed in the same manner as the present
rolls on; and that the Forces which were in action ever remained
the same.&quot;
<P>
The &quot;Forces&quot; -- their <EM>noumena </EM>rather -- are
the same, of course; therefore, the phenomenal Forces must be
the same also. But how can any one feel so sure that the attributes
of matter have not altered under the hand of Protean Evolution?
How can any materialist assert with such confidence, as is done
by Rossmassler, that &quot;this eternal conformity in the essence
of phenomena renders it certain that fire and water possessed
<EM>at all times </EM>the same powers and ever will possess them?&quot;
Who are they &quot;that darken counsel with words without knowledge,&quot;
and where were the Huxleys and Buchners when the foundations of
the earth were laid by the great Law? It is a fundamental principle
of the Occult philosophy, this same homogeneity of matter and
immutability of natural laws, which are so much insisted upon
by materialism; but that unity rests upon the inseparability of
Spirit from matter, and, if the two are once divorced, the whole
Kosmos would fall back into chaos and non-being. Therefore, it
is absolutely <EM>false</EM>,<EM> </EM>and but an additional demonstration
of the great conceit of our age, to assert (as men of science
do) that all the great geological changes and terrible convulsions
have been produced <EM>by</EM> <EM>ordinary and known physical
forces. </EM>For these forces were but the tools and final means
for the accomplishment of certain purposes, acting periodically,
and apparently mechanically, through an inward impulse mixed up
with, but beyond their material nature. There is a purpose in
every important act of Nature, whose acts are all cyclic and periodical.
But spiritual Forces having been usually confused with the purely
physical, the former are denied by, and therefore, have to remain
unknown to Science, because left unexamined.*
<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;The history of the World begins with its general aim,&quot;
says Hegel; &quot;the realization of the Idea of Spirit -- only
in an <I>implicit </I>form (<I>an sich</I>),<I> </I>that is, as
Nature; a hidden, most profoundly hidden unconscious instinct,
and the whole process of History . . . is directed to rendering
this unconscious impulse a conscious one. Thus appearing in the
form of merely natural existence, natural will -- that which has
been called the subjective side -- physical craving, instinct,
passion, private interest, as also opinion and subjective conception
-- spontaneously present themselves at the very commencement.

* Men of science will say: We deny, because nothing of the kind
has ever come within the scope of our experience. But, as argued
by Charles Richet, the physiologist: &quot;So be it, but have
you at least demonstrated the contrary? . . . Do not, at any rate,
deny <EM>a priori. </EM>Actual Science <EM>is not sufficiently
advanced to give you such right.</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>(&quot;La

SPIRIT <I>for attaining its object; </I>bringing it to consciousness
and realising it. And this aim is none other than finding itself
-- coming to itself -- and contemplating itself in concrete actuality.
But that those manifestations of vitality on the part of individuals
and peoples, in which they seek and satisfy their own purposes,
are at the same time <I>the means and instruments of a higher
power</I>,<I> of a higher and broader purpose of which they know
nothing </I>--<I> </I>which they realise unconsciously -- might
be made a matter of question; rather has been questioned . . .
on this point I announced my view at the very outset, and asserted
our hypothesis . . . and our belief <I>that Reason governs the
World and has consequently governed its history. </I>In relation
to this independently universal and substantial existence -- all
else is subordinate, subservient to it, and the means for its
development.&quot;*
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
No metaphysician or theosophist could demur to these truths, which
are all embodied in esoteric teachings. There <EM>is </EM>a predestination
in the geological life of our globe, as in the history, past and
future, of races and nations. This is closely connected with what
we call <EM>Karma </EM>and Western Pantheists, &quot;Nemesis&quot;
and &quot;Cycles.&quot; The law of evolution is now carrying us
along the ascending arc of <EM>our </EM>cycle,<EM> when the effects
will be once more re</EM>-<EM>merged into</EM>,<EM> </EM>and re-become
the (now neutralized) causes, and all things affected by the former
will have regained their original harmony. This will be the cycle
of our special &quot;Round,&quot; a moment in the duration of
the great cycle, or the <EM>Mahayuga.</EM> 
<P>
The fine philosophical remarks of Hegel are found to have their
application in the teachings of Occult Science, which shows nature
ever acting with a given purpose, whose results are always dual.
This was stated in our first Occult volumes, in <EM>Isis Unveiled</EM>,<EM>
</EM>p. 268, Vol. II., in the following words: --
<BLOCKQUOTE>
As our planet revolves once every year around the sun, and at
the same time turns once in every twenty-four hours upon its own
axis, thus traversing minor circles within a larger one, so is
the work of the smaller cyclic periods accomplished and recommenced,
within the Great Saros.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The revolution of the physical world, according to the ancient
doctrine, is attended by a like revolution in the world of intellect
-- the spiritual evolution of the world proceeding in cycles,
like the physical one.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Thus we see in history a regular alternation of ebb and flow in
the tide of human progress. The great kingdoms and empires of
the world, after reaching the culmination of their greatness,
descend again, in accordance with the same law by which they ascended;
till, having reached the lowest point, humanity reasserts itself
and mounts up once more, the height of its attainment being, by
this law of ascending progression by cycles, somewhat higher than
the point from which it had before descended.

But these cycles -- wheels within wheels, so comprehensively and
ingeniously symbolized by the various Manus and Rishis in India,

<EM>time </EM>--<EM> </EM>as explained in the <EM>Racial division
of Cycles </EM>(<EM>See sub</EM>-<EM>section </EM>6.) Hence, as
we see, the difficulty of comprehending, and discriminating between
them, with regard to their physical and spiritual effects, without
having thoroughly mastered their relations with, and action upon
the respective positions of nations and races, in their destiny
and evolution. This system cannot be comprehended if the spiritual
action of these periods<EM> </EM>--<EM> pre</EM>-<EM>ordained</EM>,<EM>
</EM>so to say, by Karmic law --is separated from their physical
course. The calculations of the best astrologers would fail, or
at any rate remain imperfect, unless this dual action is thoroughly
taken into consideration and dealt with upon these lines. And
this mastery can be achieved only through INITIATION.
<P>
The Grand Cycle includes the progress of mankind from the appearance
of primordial man of ethereal form. It runs through the inner
cycles of his (man's) progressive evolution from the ethereal
down to the semi-ethereal and purely physical: down to the redemption
of man from his<EM> coat of skin </EM>and matter, after which
it continues running its course downward and then upward again,
to meet at the culmination of a Round, when the manvantaric &quot;Serpent
swallows its tail&quot; and seven minor cycles are passed. These
are the great Racial Cycles which affect equally all the nations
and tribes included in that special Race; but there are minor
and national as well as tribal cycles within those, which run
independently of each other. They are called in the Eastern esotericism
the <EM>Karmic </EM>cycles. In the West, since Pagan Wisdom has
been repudiated as having grown from and been developed by the
dark powers supposed to be at constant war and in opposition to
the little tribal Jehovah -- the full and awful significance of
the Greek <STRONG>N</STRONG>EMESIS (or Karma) has been entirely
forgotten. Otherwise Christians would have better realized the
profound truth that Nemesis is without attributes; that while
the dreaded goddess is absolute and immutable as a Principle,
it is we ourselves -- nations and individuals -- who propel her
to action and give the impulse to its direction. <STRONG>K</STRONG>ARMA-<STRONG>N</STRONG>EMESIS
is the creator of nations and mortals, but once created, it is
they who make of her either a fury or a rewarding Angel. Yea --

<P>
-- as the <EM>chorus </EM>tells Prometheus. And as unwise they,
who believe that the goddess may be propitiated by whatever sacrifices
and prayers, or have her wheel diverted from the path it has once
taken. &quot;The triform Fates and ever mindful Furies&quot; are
her attributes only on earth, and begotten by ourselves. There
is no return from the paths she cycles over; yet those paths are
of our own making, for it is we, collectively or individually,
who prepare them. Karma-Nemesis is the synonym of <B>P</B>ROVIDENCE,
minus <EM>design</EM>, goodness, and every other <EM>finite </EM>attribute
and qualification, so unphilosophically attributed to the latter.
An Occultist or a philosopher will not speak of the goodness or
cruelty of Providence; but, identifying it with Karma-Nemesis,
he will teach that nevertheless it guards the good and watches
over them in this, as in future lives; and that it punishes the
evil-doer -- aye, even to his seventh rebirth. So long, in short,
as the effect of his having thrown into perturbation even the
smallest atom in the Infinite World of harmony, has not been finally
readjusted. For the only decree of Karma -- an eternal and immutable
decree -- is absolute Harmony in the world of matter as it is
in the world of Spirit. It is not, therefore, Karma that rewards
or punishes, but it is we, who reward or punish ourselves according
to whether we work with, through and along with nature, abiding
by the laws on which that Harmony depends, or -- break them.
<P>
Nor would the ways of Karma be inscrutable were men to work in
union and harmony, instead of disunion and strife. For our ignorance
of those ways -- which one portion of mankind calls the ways of
Providence, dark and intricate; while another sees in them the
action of blind Fatalism; and a third, simple chance, with neither
gods nor devils to guide them -- would surely disappear, if we
would but attribute all these to their correct cause. With right
knowledge, or at any rate with a confident conviction that our
neighbours will no more work to hurt us than we would think of
harming them, the two-thirds of the World's evil would vanish
into thin air. Were no man to hurt his brother, Karma-Nemesis
would have neither cause to work for, nor weapons to act through.
It is the constant presence in our midst of every element of strife
and opposition, and the division of races, nations, tribes, societies
and individuals into Cains and Abels, wolves and lambs, that is
the chief cause of the &quot;ways of Providence.&quot; We cut
these numerous windings in our destinies daily with our own hands,
while we imagine that we are pursuing a track on the royal high
road of respectability and duty, and then complain of those ways
being so intricate and so dark. We stand bewildered before the
mystery of our own making, and the riddles of life that <EM>we
will not </EM>solve, and then accuse the great Sphinx of devouring
us. But verily there is not an accident in our lives,<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 644 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</H6>

<P>
not a misshapen day, or a misfortune, that could not be traced
back to our own doings in this or in another life. If one breaks
the laws of Harmony, or, as a theosophical writer expresses it,
&quot;the laws of life,&quot; one must be prepared to fall into
the chaos one has oneself produced. For, according to the same
writer, &quot;the only conclusion one can come to is that these
laws of life are their own avengers; and consequently that every
avenging Angel is only a typified representation of their re-action.&quot;
<P>
Therefore, if any one is helpless before these immutable laws,
it is not ourselves, the artificers of our destinies, but rather
those angels, the guardians of harmony. Karma-Nemesis is no more
than the (spiritual) dynamical effect of causes produced and forces
awakened into activity by our own actions. It is a law of occult
dynamics that &quot;a given amount of energy expended on the spiritual
or astral plane is productive of far greater results than the
same amount expended on the physical objective plane of existence.&quot;
<P>
This state will last till man's spiritual intuitions are fully
opened, which will not happen before we fairly cast off our thick
coats of matter; until we begin acting from <EM>within</EM>,<EM>
</EM>instead of ever following impulses from <EM>without; </EM>namely,
those produced by our physical senses and gross selfish body.
Until then the only palliative to the evils of life is union and
harmony -- a Brotherhood IN ACTU, and <EM>altruism </EM>not simply
in name. The suppression of one single bad <EM>cause </EM>will
suppress not one, but a variety of bad effects. And if a Brotherhood
or even a number of Brotherhoods may not be able to prevent nations
from occasionally cutting each other's throats -- still unity
in thought and action, and philosophical research into the mysteries
of being, will always prevent some, while trying to comprehend
that which has hitherto remained to them a riddle, from creating
additional causes in a world already so full of woe and evil.
Knowledge of Karma gives the conviction that if --

<P>
it is only because that mankind has ever shut its eyes to the
great truth that man is himself his own saviour as his own destroyer.
That he need not accuse Heaven and the gods, Fates and Providence,
of the apparent injustice that reigns in the midst of humanity.
But let him rather remember and repeat this bit of Grecian wisdom,
which warns man to forbear accusing <EM>That </EM>which --

and tribe, like their Eastern brethren of the Fifth Race, their
Golden and their Iron ages, their period of comparative irresponsibility,

their Iron Age, the <EM>Kali-Yuga</EM>,<EM> </EM>an age <STRONG>B</STRONG>LACK
WITH <STRONG>H</STRONG>ORRORS. . . . .
<P>
It is true, on the other hand, that the exoteric cycles of every
nation have been correctly made to be derived from, and depend
on, sidereal motions. The latter are inseparably blended with
the destinies of nations and men. But in their purely physical
sense, Europe knows of no other cycles than the astronomical,
and makes its computations accordingly. Nor will it hear of any
other than <EM>imaginary </EM>circles or circuits in the starry
heavens that gird them --

<P>
But with the pagans, with whom, as Coleridge has it -- &quot;.
. . . . Time, cyclical time, was their abstraction of the Deity
. .&quot; that &quot;Deity&quot; manifesting co-ordinately with,
and only through Karma, and being that KARMA-NEMESIS itself, the
cycles meant something more than a mere succession of events,
or a periodical space of time of more or less prolonged duration.
For they were generally marked with recurrences of a more varied
and intellectual character than are exhibited in the periodical
return of seasons or of certain constellations. Modern wisdom
is satisfied with astronomical computations and prophecies based
on unerring mathematical laws. Ancient Wisdom added to the cold
shell of astronomy the vivifying elements of its soul and spirit
-- ASTROLOGY. And, as the sidereal motions <EM>do</EM> regulate
and determine other events on Earth -- besides potatoes and the
periodical disease of that useful vegetable -- (a statement which,
not being amenable to scientific explanation, is merely derided,
while accepted) -- those events have to be allowed to find themselves
predetermined by even simple astronomical computations. Believers
in astrology will understand our meaning, sceptics will laugh
at the belief and mock the idea. Thus they shut their eyes, ostrich-like,
to their own fate. . . . . . .*

<P>
* Not all, however, for there are men of Science awakening to
truth. This is what we read: &quot;Whatever way we turn our eyes
we encounter a mystery . . . . all in Nature for us is <EM>the
unknown</EM>. . . Yet they are numerous, those superficial minds
for whom nothing can be produced by natural forces outside of
facts observed long ago, consecrated in books and grouped more
or less skilfully with the help of theories whose ephemeral duration
ought, by this time, to have demonstrated their insufficiency,
. . . . I do not pretend <EM>to contest the possibility of invisible
Beings</EM>,<EM> of a nature different from ours and susceptible
of moving matter to action. </EM>Profound philosophers have admitted
it in all epochs as a consequence of the great law of continuity
which rules the Universe. That intellectual life, which we see
starting in some way from non-being (<EM>neant</EM>) and gradually
reaching man, can it stop abruptly at man to reappear only in
the infinite, in the sovereign regulator of the world? This is
little probable.&quot; Therefore . . &quot;I [[Footnote continued

<H6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 646 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</H6>

<P>
This because their little <EM>historical </EM>period, so called,
allows them no margin for comparison. Sidereal heaven is before
them; and though their spiritual vision is still unopened and
the atmospheric dust of terrestrial origin seals their sight and
chains it to the limits of physical systems, still they do not
fail to perceive the movements and note the behaviour of meteors
and comets. They record the periodical advents of those wanderers
and &quot;flaming messengers,&quot; and prophesy, in consequence,
earthquakes, meteoric showers, the apparition of certain stars,
comets, etc., etc. Are they soothsayers for all that? No, they
are learned astronomers.
<P>
Why, then, should occultists and astrologers, as learned, be disbelieved,
when they prophesy the return of some cyclic event on the same
mathematical principle? Why should the claim that they <EM>know
it </EM>be ridiculed? Their forefathers and predecessors, having
recorded the recurrence of such events in their time and day,
throughout a period embracing hundreds of thousands of years,
the conjunction of the same constellations must necessarily produce,
if not quite the same, at any rate, similar effects. Are the prophecies
derided, because of the claim of the hundreds of thousands of
years of observation, and the millions of years of the human races?
In its turn modern Science is laughed at for its far more modest
geological and anthropological figures, by those who hold to Biblical
chronology. Thus Karma adjusts even human laughter at the mutual
expense of sects, learned societies, and individuals. Yet in the
prognostication of <EM>such </EM>future events, at any rate, all
foretold on the authority of cyclic recurrences, there is no psychic
phenomenon involved. It is neither <EM>prevision</EM>,<EM> nor
prophecy; </EM>no more than is the signalling of a comet or star,
several years before its appearance. It is simply knowledge and
mathematically correct computations which enable the <STRONG>W</STRONG>ISE
<STRONG>M</STRONG>EN OF THE <STRONG>E</STRONG>AST to foretell,
for instance, that England is on the eve of such or another catastrophe;
France, nearing such a point of her cycle, and Europe in general
threatened with, or rather, on the eve of, a cataclysm, which
her own cycle of racial <EM>Karma has led her </EM>to. The reliability
of the information depends, of course, on the acceptation or rejection
of the claim for a tremendous period of historical observation.
Eastern Initiates maintain that they have preserved records of
the racial development and of events of universal import ever
since the beginning of the Fourth Race -- that which preceded
being traditional. Moreover, those who believe in Seership and

powers will have no difficulty in crediting the general character,
at least, of the information given, even if traditional, once
the latter is checked and corrected by the corroboration of clairvoyance
and esoteric knowledge. But in the present case no such metaphysical
belief is claimed as our chief dependence, but a proof is given
on what, to every Occultist, is quite scientific evidence -- the
records preserved through the <EM>Zodiac </EM>for incalculable
ages.
<P>
It is now amply proved that even horoscopes and judiciary astrology
are not quite based on a fiction, and that stars and constellations,
consequently, have an occult and mysterious influence on, and
connection with, individuals. And if with the latter, why not
with nations, races, and mankind in bulk? This, again, is a claim
made on the authority of the Zodiacal records. We shall examine
then, if you please, how far the Zodiac was known to the ancients,
and how far it is forgotten by the moderns.
