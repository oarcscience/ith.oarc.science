### ยง V. ORGANIC EVOLUTION AND CREATIVE CENTRES.

**I**T is argued that the Universal Evolution, otherwise, the gradual
development of species in all the kingdoms of nature, works by uniform
laws. This is admitted, and the law enforced far more strictly in
Esoteric than in modern Science. But we are told also, that it is
equally a law that "development works from the less to the more perfect,
and from the simpler to the more complicated, by incessant changes,
small in themselves, but constantly accumulating in the required
direction." It is from the infinitesimally small that the comparatively
gigantic species are produced.

Esoteric Science agrees with it, but adds that this law applies only to
what is known to it as the *Primary Creation* -*-* the evolution of
worlds from primordial atoms, and the *pre-primordial* **A**TOM, at the
first differentiation of the former; and that during the period of
cyclic evolution in space and time, this law is limited and works only
in the lower kingdoms. It did so work during the first geological
periods, from simple to complex, on the rough material surviving from
the relics of the Third Round, which relics are projected into
objectivity when terrestrial activity recommences.

No more than Science, does esoteric philosophy admit *design* or
*"*special creation." It rejects every claim to the "miraculous," and
accepts nothing outside the uniform and immutable laws of Nature. But it
teaches a cyclic law, a double stream of force (or spirit) and of
matter, which, starting from the *neutral centre* of Being, develops in
its cyclic progress and incessant transformations. The primitive germ
from which all vertebrate life has developed throughout the ages, being
distinct from the primitive germ from which the vegetable and the animal
life have evolved, there are side laws whose work is determined by the
conditions in which the materials to be worked upon are found by them,
and of which Science -- physiology and anthropology especially -- seems
to be little aware. Its votaries speak of that "primitive germ," and
maintain that it is shown beyond any doubt that the "design" and the
"*designer,*" if there be any, in the case of man, with the wonderful
structure of his limbs, and his hand especially, "must be placed very
much farther back, and (the design) is, in fact, involved in the
primitive germ," from which not only all vertebrate life, but, "probably
all life, animal and vegetable, have been slowly developed" (*p*. 94
*of* "*Modern Science and Modern Thought*")*.*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

###### \[\[Vol. 2, Page\]\] 732 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.

This is as true of the "primitive germ" as it is false that that "germ"
is only "very much farther back" than man is; for it is at an
immeasurable and inconceivable distance (*in time,* though not in space)
from the origin even of our Solar system. As the Hindu philosophy very
justly teaches, the "*Aniyamsam Aniyasam,*" can be known only through
false notions. It is the "many" that proceed from the ONE -- the living
spiritual germs *or centres of forces* -- each in a septenary form,
which first generate, and then give the PRIMARY IMPULSE to the law of
evolution and gradual slow development.

Limiting the teaching strictly to this, our earth, it may be shown that,
as the ethereal forms of the first Men are first projected on seven
zones by seven Dhyan-Chohanic *centres of* Force, so there are centres
of creative power for every ROOT or parent species of the host of forms
of vegetable and animal life. This is, again, no "special creation," nor
is there any "Design," except in the general "ground-plan" worked out by
the universal law. But there are certainly "designers," though these are
neither omnipotent nor omniscient in the absolute sense of the term.
They are simply *Builders,* or Masons, working under the impulse given
them by the ever-to-be-unknown (on our plane) Master Mason -- the
**O**NE **L**IFE and Law. Belonging to this sphere, they have no hand
in, or possibility of working on any other, during the present
Manvantara, at any rate. That they work in cycles and on a strictly
geometrical and mathematical scale of progression, is what the extinct
animal species amply demonstrate; that they act by *design* in the
details of minor lives (of side animal issues, etc.) is what natural
history has sufficient evidence for. In the *creation* of new species,
departing sometimes very widely from the Parent stock, as in the great
variety of the *genus Felis --* like the lynx, the tiger, the cat, etc.
-- it is the "designers" who direct the new evolution by adding to, or
depriving the species of certain appendages, either needed or becoming
useless in the new environments. Thus, when we say that *Nature*
provides for every animal and plant, whether large or small, we speak
correctly. For, it is those terrestrial spirits of Nature, who form the
aggregated Nature; which, if it fails occasionally in its design, is
neither to be considered blind, nor to be taxed with the failure; since,
belonging to *a differentiated* sum of qualities and attributes, it is
in virtue of that alone *conditioned and imperfect.*

Were there no such thing as evolutionary cycles, an eternal spiral
progress into matter with a proportionate *obscuration* of spirit --
though the two are one -- followed by an inverse ascent into spirit and
the defeat of matter -- active and passive by turn -- how explain the
discoveries of zoology and geology? How is it that, on the dictum of
authoritative science, one can trace the animal life from the mollusc up

to the great Sea Dragon, from the smallest land-worm up again to the
gigantic animals of the Tertiary Period; and that the latter were once
crossed is shown by the fact of all those species *decreasing, dwindling
down and being dwarfed.* If the seeming process of development working
from the less to the more perfect, and from the simpler to the more
complex, were a universal law indeed, instead of being a very imperfect
generalization of a mere secondary nature in the great Cosmic process,
and if there were no such cycles as those claimed, then the Mesozoic
fauna and flora ought to change places with the latest Neolithic. It is
the Plesiosauri and the Ichthyosauri that we ought to find developing
from the present sea and river reptiles, instead of giving place to
their dwarfed modern analogies. It is, again, our old friend, the
good-tempered elephant, that would be the fossil antediluvian ancestor,
and the mammoth of the Pliocene age who would be in the *menagerie*; the
megalonyx and the gigantic megatherium would be found instead of the
lazy sloth in the forests of South America, in which the colossal ferns
of the carboniferous periods would take the place of moss and present
trees -- dwarfs, even the giants of California, in comparison with the
Titan-trees of past geological periods. Surely the organisms of the
megasthenian world of the Tertiary and the Mesozoic Ages must have been
*more complex and perfect* than those of the microsthenian plants and
animals of the present age? The Dryopithecus, for instance, is found
more perfect anatomically, more fit for a greater development of brain
power, than the modern gorilla or gibbon? How is this, then? Are we to
believe that the constitution of all those colossal land and
sea-dragons, of the gigantic flying reptiles, was not far more developed
and complex than the anatomy of the lizards, turtles, crocodiles, and
even of the whales -- in short, all those animals we are acquainted
with?

Let us admit, however, for argument's sake, that all those cycles,
races, septenary forms of evolution and the *tutti quanti* of esoteric
teaching, are no better than a delusion and a snare. Let us agree with
Science and say that man, instead of being an imprisoned "Spirit," and
his vehicle, the *shell* or body, a gradually perfected and now complete
mechanism for material and terrestrial uses, as claimed by the
Occultists -- is simply a more developed animal, whose primal form
emerged from one and the same primitive germ on this earth, as the
flying dragon and the gnat, the whale and the amoeba, the crocodile and
the frog, etc., etc. In this case, he must have passed through the
identical developments and through the same process of growth as all the
other mammals? If man is an animal, *and* *nothing more,* a highly
intellectual *ex-brute,* he should be privileged, at least, and allowed
to have been a gigantic mammal of his kind, a

*meganthropos* in his day. It is just this, that esoteric science shows
as having taken place in the first three rounds, and in this, as in most
other things, it is more logical and consistent than modern science. It
classifies the human body with the brute creation, and maintains it in
the path of animal evolution, from first to last, while science leaves
man a parentless orphan born of sires unknown, an "unspecialized
skeleton" truly! And this mistake is due to a stubborn rejection of the
doctrine of cycles.

**T**HE **O**RIGIN AND **E**VOLUTION OF THE **M**AMMALIA: **S**CIENCE
AND THE

**E**SOTERIC **P**HYLOGENY.

Having dealt almost exclusively with the question of the origin of Man
in the foregoing criticism of Western Evolutionism, it may not be amiss
to define the position of the Occultists with regard to the
differentiation of species. The *pre-human* fauna and flora have been
already generally dealt with in the Commentary on the Stanzas, and the
truth of much of modern biological speculation admitted, *e.g.*, the
derivation of birds from reptiles, the *partial* truth of "natural
selection," and the transformation theory generally. It now remains to
clear up the mystery of the origin of those first mammalian fauna which
M. de Quatrefages so brilliantly endeavours to prove as contemporary
with the Homo primigenius of the Secondary Age.

The somewhat complicated problem relating to the "Origin of Species," --
more especially of the varied groups of fossil or existing mammalian
fauna -- will be rendered less obscure by the aid of a diagram. It will
then be apparent to what extent the "Factors of Organic Evolution,"
relied upon by Western biologists,\* are to be considered as

###### \[\[Footnote(s)\]\] -------------------------------------------------

\* The Darwinian theory has been so strained, that even Huxley was
forced at one time to deprecate its occasional degeneration into
"fanaticism." Oscar Schmidt presents a good instance of a thinker who
unconsciously exaggerates the worth of an hypothesis. He admits ("The
Doctrine of Descent and Darwinism," p. 158), that "natural selection"
"is in some cases . . . *inadequate*, . . . in others . . . not
requisite, as the solution of the formation of species is found in other
natural conditions." He also asserts the "*intermediate grades are* . .
. *wanting*, which would entitle us to infer with certainty the direct
transition from unplacental to placental mammals" (p. 271); that "we are
referred *entirely to conjecture and* *inference* for the origin of the
mammals" (p. 268); and the repeated failures of the framers of
"*hypothetical pedigrees,*" more especially of Haeckel. Nevertheless he
asserts on p. 194, that "what we have gained by the Doctrine of Descent
based on the theory of selection is the KNOWLEDGE of the connection of
organisms as 'consanguineous beings.' " Knowledge in the face of the
above-cited concessions, is, then, the synonym for conjecture and theory
only?

###### \[\[Vol. 2, Page\]\] 735 CONJECTURES ARE NOT FACTS.

adequate to meet the facts. The line of demarcation between
etherospiritual, astral and physical evolution must be drawn. Perhaps,
if Darwinians deigned to consider the possibility of the second process,
they would no longer have to lament the fact that "we are *referred to
conjecture and inference* for the origin of the Mammals"!! (*The
Doctrine of Descent and Darwinism,* p. 268, by Professor O. Schmidt.) At
present the admitted chasm between the systems of reproduction of the
oviparous vertebrates and mammalia, constitutes a hopeless crux to those
thinkers who, with the Evolutionists, seek to link all existing organic
forms in a continuous line of descent.

Let us take -- *exempli gratia* -- the case of the ungulate mammals. "In
no other division," it is said, "do we possess such abundant fossil
material." So much progress has been made in this direction, that in
some instances the intermediate links between the modern and Eocene
ungulates have been unearthed; a notable example being that of the
complete proof of the derivation of the present one-toed horse from the
three-toed Anchitherium of the old Tertiary. This standard of comparison
between Western Biology and the Eastern doctrine could not, therefore,
be improved upon. The pedigree here utilized, as embodying the views of
scientists in general, is that of Schmidt based on the exhaustive
researches of Rutimeyer. Its *approximate* accuracy -- from the
standpoint of evolutionism -- leaves little to be desired: --

The midway point of evolution. Science comes to a standstill. "*The*
*root to which these two families lead back* IS UNKNOWN" (Schmidt).

![](sd2-736.gif)

No. I. represents the realm explored by Western Evolutionists, the area
in which climatic influences, "natural selection," and all the other
*physical* causes of organic differentiation are present. Biology and
palaeontology find their province here in investigating the many
physical agencies which contribute so largely, as shown by Darwin,
Spencer and others, to the *segregation of species.* But even in this
domain the sub-conscious workings of the *Dhyan-Chohanic wisdom* are at
the root of all the "ceaseless striving towards perfection," though its
influence is vastly modified by those purely material causes which de
Quatrefages terms the "*milieux*" and Spencer the "Environment."

The "midway point of evolution" is that stage where the *astral*
prototypes definitely begin to pass into the physical, and thus become
subject to the differentiating agencies now operative around us.
Physical causation supervenes immediately on the assumption of "coats of
skin" -- *i.e.*, the physiological equipment in general. The forms of
Men and mammalia previous to the separation of sexes\* are woven out of
astral matter, and possess a structure utterly unlike that of the
physical organisms, which eat, drink, digest, etc., etc., etc. The known
physiological contrivances in organisms were almost entirely evolved
subsequently to the incipient physicalization of the 7 Root-Types out of
the astral -- during the "midway halt" between the two planes of
existence. Hardly had the "ground-plan" of evolution been limned out in
these ancestral types, than the influence of the accessory terrestrial
laws, familiar to us, supervened, resulting in the whole crop of
mammalian species. AEons of slow differentiation were, however, required
to effect this end.

###### \[\[Footnote(s)\]\] -------------------------------------------------

\* Bear in mind, please, that though the animals -- mammalians included
-- have all been evolved after and partially *from* man's cast-off
tissues, still, as a far lower being, the mammalian animal became
placental and separated far earlier than man.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

\[\[Vol. 2, Page\]\] 737 THE UNITY OF TYPE.

No. **II**. represents the domain of the purely astral prototypes
previous to their descent into (gross) matter. Astral matter, it must be
noted, is fourth state matter, having, like our gross matter, its own
"protyle." There are several "protyles" in Nature, corresponding to the
various planes of matter. The two sub-physical elemental kingdoms, the
plane of mind (*manas,* the fifth state matter), as also that of Buddhi
(sixth state matter), are each and all evolved from one of the six
"protyles" which constitute the basis of the Object-Universe. The three
"states," so-called of our terrestrial matter, known as the "solid,"
"liquid," and "gaseous," are only, in strict accuracy, SUB-states. As to
the former reality of the descent into the physical, which culminated in
physiological man and animal, we have a palpable testimony in the fact
of the so-called spiritualistic "materializations."

In all these instances a complete temporary mergence of the astral into
the physical takes place. The evolution of *physiological* Man out of
the astral races of *early* Lemurian age -- the Jurassic age of Geology
-- is exactly paralleled by the "materialization" of "spirits" (?) in
the seance-room. In the case of Professor Crookes' "Katie King," the
presence of a *physiological* mechanism -- heart, lungs, etc. -- was
indubitably demonstrated!!

This, in a way, is the **A**RCHETYPE of Goethe. Listen to his words:
"Thus much we should have gained . . . all the nine perfect organic
beings . . . (are) formed *according to an archetype* which merely
fluctuates more or less in its very persistent parts and, moreover, day
by day, completes and transforms itself by means of reproduction." This
is a seemingly imperfect foreshadowing of the occult fact of the
differentiation of species from the primal *astral root-types.* Whatever
the whole posse comitatus of "natural selection," etc., etc., may
effect, the *fundamental unity of structural plan* remains practically
unaffected by all subsequent modifications. The "Unity of Type" common,
in a sense, to all the animal and human kingdoms, is not, as Spencer and
others appear to hold, a proof of the consanguineity of *all* organic
forms, but a witness to the essential unity of the "ground-plan" Nature
has followed in fashioning her creatures.

To sum up the case, we may again avail ourselves of a tabulation of the
actual *factors* concerned in the differentiation of species. The stages
of the process itself need no further comment here, being the basic
principles underlying organic development, than to enter on the domain
of the biological specialist.

**I**S Science against those who maintain that down to the Quaternary
period the distribution of the human races was widely different from
what it is now? Is Science against those who, further, maintain that the
fossil men found in Europe -- although having almost reached a plane of
sameness and unity from the fundamental physiological and
anthropological aspects which continues till this day -- still differ,
sometimes greatly, from the type of the now existing populations. The
late Littre confesses it in an article published by him on the Memoir
called *Antiquites Celtiques et Antediluviennes* by Boucher de Perthes
(1849) -*-* in the *Revue des Deux Mondes* (*March* 1,1859)*.* He says
in it (*a*) that in these periods when the Mammoths, exhumed with the
hatchets in Picardy, lived in the latter region, there must have been an
eternal spring reigning over all the terrestrial globe\*; nature was the
contrary of what it is now -- thus leaving an *enormous margin for the
antiquity of*

contention as to the balmy spring of the *Quaternary --* to which
deposits M. de Perthes' discoveries of flint implements are traceable
(since when the Somme has worn down its valley many scores of feet) --
must be accepted with much reservation. The Somme-valley relics are
*post-glacial,* and possibly point to the immigration of savages during
one of the more temperate periods intervening between *minor* ages of
Ice.

*those* "*periods*" and then adds: (*b*) "Spring, professor of the
Faculty of Medicine at Liege, found in a grotto near Namur, in the
mountain of Chauvaux, numerous human bones '*of a race quite distinct
from ours.*' "

Skulls exhumed in Austria offered a great analogy with those of African
negro races, according to Littre, while others, discovered on the shores
of the Danube and the Rhine, resembled the skulls of the Caribs and
those of the ancient inhabitants of Peru and Chili. Still, the *Deluge,*
whether Biblical or Atlantean, was denied. But further geological
discoveries having made Gaudry write conclusively: "Our forefathers were
positively contemporaneous with the *rhinoceros tichorrhinus,* the
*hippopotamus major*"; and add that the soil called *diluvial* in
geology "was formed *partially* at least after man's apparition on
earth" -- Littre pronounced himself finally. He then showed the
necessity, before "the resurrection of so many old witnesses," of
*rehandling* all the origins, all the durations, and added that there
was AN AGE hitherto unknown to study "either at the dawn of the actual
epoch or, as I believe, at the beginning of the epoch *which preceded
it.*"

The types of the skulls found in Europe are of two kinds, as is well
known: the orthognathous and the prognathous, or the Caucasian and the
negro types; such as are now found only in the African and the lower
savage tribes. Professor Heer -- who argues that the facts of Botany
necessitate the hypothesis of an Atlantis -- has shown that the plants
of the Neolithic lake-villagers are mainly of *African* origin. How did
the latter come to be in Europe if there was no former point of union
between Africa and Europe? How many thousand years ago did the seventeen
men live whose skeletons were exhumed in the Department of the Haute
Garonne, in a squatting posture near the remains of a coal fire, with
some amulets and broken crockery around them, and in company with the
bear *spelaeus,* the *Elephas primigenius,* the *aurochs* (regarded by
Cuvier as a distinct species), the *Megaceros hibernicus --* all
antediluvian mammals? Certainly at a most distant epoch, but not one
which carries us further back than the Quaternary. A much greater
antiquity for Man has yet to be proved. Dr. James Hunt, the late
President of the Anthropological Society, makes it 9,000,000 years. This
man of science, at any rate, makes some approach to our esoteric
computation, if we leave the first two semi-human, ethereal races, and
the early Third Race out of the computation.

The question, however, arises -- who were these Palaeolithic men of the
European quaternary epoch? Were they aboriginal, or the outcome of some
immigration dating back into the unknown past? The latter is the only
tenable hypothesis, as all scientists agree in eliminating Europe from
the category of possible "cradles of mankind." Whence, then, radiated
the various successive streams of "primitive" men?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

###### \[\[Vol. 2, Page\]\] 740 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.

The earliest Palaeolithic men in Europe -- about whose origin Ethnology
is silent, and whose very characteristics are but imperfectly known,
though expatiated on as "ape-like" by imaginative writers such as Mr.
Grant Allen -- were of pure Atlantean and "Africo"-Atlantean stocks.\*
(It must be borne in mind that by this time the Atlantis continent
itself was a dream of the past.) Europe in the quaternary epoch was very
different from the Europe of to-day, being then only in process of
formation. It was united to N. Africa -- or rather what is now N. Africa
-- by a neck of land running across the present Straits of Gibraltar --
N. Africa thus constituting a species of extension of Spain, while a
broad sea washed the great basin of the Sahara. Of the great Atlantis,
the main bulk of which sank in the Miocene, there remained only Ruta and
Daitya and a stray island or so. The Atlantean connections of the
forefathers\*\* of the Palaeolithic cave-men are evidenced by the
upturning of fossil skulls (in Europe) reverting closely to the *West
Indian* Carib and *ancient Peruvian* type -- a mystery indeed to all
those who refuse to sanction the "hypothesis" of a former Atlantic
continent to bridge the ocean (Cf. "Scientific and geological proofs of
the reality of several submerged continents"). What are we also to make
of the fact that while de Quatrefages points to that "*magnificent
race,*" the TALL Cro-Magnon cave-men and the *Guanches* of the Canary
Islands as representatives of one type -- Virchow also allies the
*Basques* with the latter in a similar way? Professor Retzius
independently proves the relationship of the aboriginal *American*
dolichocephalous tribes and these same *Guanches.* The several links in
the chain of evidence are securely joined together. Legions of similar
facts could be adduced. As to the African tribes -- themselves diverging
offshoots of Atlanteans modified by climate and conditions -- they
crossed into Europe over the peninsula which made the Mediterranean an
inland sea. Fine races were many of these European cave-men; the
Cro-Magnon, for instance. But, as was to be expected, *progress is
almost non-existent* through the whole of the vast period allotted

Allen).

inhospitable climate, but moved into Europe from* *some more genial
region --* (Dr. Southall "*Epoch* *of the Mammoth*" p. 315).

\*\* The *pure* Atlantean stocks -- of which the tall quaternary
cave-men were, in part, the direct descendants -- immigrated into Europe
long prior to the Glacial Period; in fact as far back as the Pliocene
and Miocene times in the Tertiary. *The worked Miocene flints of Thenay,
and the traces of Pliocene man discovered by Professor Capellini in
Italy, are witnesses to the fact.* These colonists were portions of the
once glorious race, whose cycle from the *Eocene* downwards had been

by Science to the Chipped Stone-Age.\* *The cyclic impulse downwards*
weighs heavily on the stocks thus transplanted -- the incubus of the
*Atlantean Karma* is upon them. Finally, Palaeolithic man makes room for
his successor -- and disappears almost entirely from the scene.
Professor Lefevre asks in this connection: --

"Has the Polished succeeded the Chipped Stone-Age by an imperceptible
transition, or was it due to an invasion of brachycephalous Celts? But
whether, again, the deterioration produced in the populations of La
Vezere was the result of violent crossings, or of a general retreat
northwards in the wake of the reindeer, is of little moment to us." He
continues: --

"Meantime the bed of the ocean has been upheaved, Europe is now fully
formed, her flora and fauna fixed. With the taming of the dog begins the
pastoral life. *We enter on those polished stone and bronze periods,*
which succeed each other at irregular intervals, which even overlap one
another in the midst of ethnical fusions and migrations. . . . The
primitive European populations are interrupted in their special
evolution and, without perishing, become absorbed in other races,
engulfed . . . by successive waves of migration overflowing from Africa,
*possibly from a lost Atlantis* \[?? far too late by aeons of years\]
and from prolific Asia . . . all FORERUNNERS OF THE GREAT **A**RYAN
**I**NVASION" (Fifth Race).

\* The artistic skill displayed by the old cave-men renders the
hypothesis which regards them as approximations to the "pithecanthropus
alalus" -- that very mythical Haeckelian monster -- an absurdity
requiring no Huxley or Schmidt to expose it. We see in their skill in
engraving a *gleam* of Atlantean culture *atavistically* re-appearing.
It will be remembered that Donnelly regards modern European as a
*renaissance* of Atlantean civilization. ("Atlantis," pp. 237-264.)
