**A**.

**G**EOLOGICAL **F**ACTS BEARING ON THE **Q**UESTION OF THEIR
**R**ELATIONSHIP.

**T**HE data derived from scientific research as to "primeval man" and
the ape lend no countenance to theories deriving the former from the
latter. "Where, then, must we look for primeval man?" still queries Mr.
Huxley, after having vainly searched for him in the very depths of the
quaternary strata. "Was the oldest *Homo sapiens* Pliocene or Miocene,
or yet more ancient? In still older strata do the fossilized bones of
*an ape more anthropoid,* or *a man more pithecoid* than any yet known,
await the researches of some unborn palaeontologist? Time will show . .
. ." ("Man's Place in Nature," p. 159).

It will -- undeniably -- and thus vindicate the anthropology of the
Occultists. Meanwhile, in his eagerness to vindicate Mr. Darwin's
*Descent of Man,* Mr. Boyd Dawkins believes he has all but found the
"missing link" -- in theory. It was due to theologians more than to
geologists that, till nearly 1860, man had been considered a relic no
older than the Adamic orthodox 6,000 years. As Karma would have it
though, it was left to a French Abbe -- l'abbe Bourgeois -- to give this
easy-going theory even a worse blow than had been given to it by the
discoveries of Boucher de Perthes. Everyone knows that the Abbe
discovered and brought to light good evidence that man already existed
during the Miocene period; for flints of undeniably human making were
excavated from Miocene strata. In the words of the author of "Modern
Science and Modern Thought": --

Or -- *the descendant of Eocene Man,* which is a variant offered to the
theory. Meanwhile, the Dryopithecus with such fine mental endowments is
yet to be discovered. On the other hand, Neolithic and even Palaeolithic
man having become an absolute certainty, -- and, as the same author
justly observes: "If 100,000,000 years have elapsed since

the earth became sufficiently solidified to support vegetable and animal
life, the Tertiary period may have lasted for 5,000,000; or for
10,000,000 years, if the life-sustaining order of things has lasted, as
Lyell supposes, for at least 200,000,000 years" -- why should not
another theory be tried? Let us carry man, as an hypothesis, to the
close of Mesozoic times -- admitting *argumenti causa* that the (much
more recent) higher apes then existed! This would allow ample time to
man and the modern apes to have diverged from the mythical "*ape more
anthropoid,*" and even for the latter to have degenerated into those
that are found *mimicking* man in using "branches of trees as clubs, and
cracking cocoa-nuts with hammer and stones."\* Some savage tribes of
hillmen in India build their abodes on trees, just as the gorillas build
their dens. The question, which of the two, the beast or the man, has
become the imitator of the other, is scarcely an open one, even granting
Mr. Boyd Dawkins' theory. The fanciful character of his hypothesis, is,
however, generally admitted. It is argued that while in the Pliocene and
Miocene periods there were true apes and baboons, and man was undeniably
contemporaneous with the former of those times -- though as we see
orthodox anthropology still hesitates in the teeth of facts to place him
in the era of the Dryopithecus, which latter "has been considered by
some anatomists as in some respects superior to the chimpanzee or the
gorilla" -- yet, in the Eocene there have been no other fossil
*primates* unearthed and no pithecoid stocks found save a few extinct
lemurian forms. And we find it also *hinted* that the Dryopithecus *may
have been* the "missing link," though the brain of the creature no more
warrants the theory than does the brain of the modern gorilla. (*Vide*
also Gaudry's speculations.)

Now we would ask who among the Scientists is ready to prove that *there
was no man* in existence in the early Tertiary period? What is it that
prevented his presence? Hardly thirty years ago his existence any
farther back than 6, or 7,000 years was indignantly denied. Now he is
refused admission into the Eocene age. Next century it may become a
question whether man was not contemporary with the "flying Dragons;" the
pterodactyl, the plesiosaurus and iguanodon, etc., etc. Let us listen,
however, to the echo of Science.

islands. We do know of large apes who, tamed and living in houses, will
mimic men to the length of donning hats and coats. The writer had
personally a chimpanzee who, without being taught, opened a newspaper
and pretended to read in it. It is the descending generations, the
children, who mimic their parents -- not the reverse.

While most of the men of Science, who are uncompromising in their belief
in the descent of man from an "extinct anthropoid mammal," will not
accept even the bare tenability of any other theory than an ancestor
common to man and the Dryopithecus, it is refreshing to find in a work
of real scientific value such a margin for compromise. Indeed, it is as
wide as it can be made under the circumstances, *i.e.*, without
immediate danger of getting knocked off one's feet by the tidal wave of
"science-adulation." Believing that the difficulty of accounting "for
the development of *intellect* and *morality* by evolution is *not so

There *was* a "special creation" for man, and a "special creation" for
the ape, *his* progeny; only on other lines than ever bargained for by
Science. Albert Gaudry and others give some weighty reasons why man
cannot be regarded as the crown of an ape-stock. When one finds that not
only was the "primeval savage" (?) a reality in the Miocene times, but
that, as de Mortillet shows, the flint relics he has left behind him
were splintered *by* *fire* in that remote epoch; when we learn that the
Dryopithecus, *alone of the anthropoids,* appears in those strata, what
is the natural inference? That the Darwinians are in a quandary. The
very manlike Gibbon is *still in the same low grade of development, as
it was when it co-existed with Man at the close of the Glacial Period.*
It has not appreciably altered since the Pliocene times. Now there is
little to choose between the Dryopithecus and the existing anthropoids
-- gibbon, gorilla, etc. If, then, the Darwinian theory is
all-sufficient, how are we to "explain" the evolution of this

ape into Man during the first half of the Miocene? The time is far too
short for such a theoretical transformation. The extreme slowness with
which variation in species supervenes renders the thing inconceivable --
more especially on the Natural Selection hypothesis. The enormous mental
and structural gulf between a savage acquainted with fire and the mode
of kindling it, and a brutal anthropoid, is too much to bridge even in
idea, during so contracted a period. Let the Evolutionists push back the
process into the preceding *Eocene,* if they prefer to do so; let them
even trace both Man and Dryopithecus to a common ancestor; the
unpleasant consideration has, nevertheless, to be faced that in Eocene
strata the anthropoid fossils are as conspicuous by their absence, as is
the fabulous *pithecanthropus* of Haeckel. Is an exit out of this *cul
de sac* to be found by an appeal to the "unknown," and a reference with
Darwin to the "imperfection of the geological record"? So be it; but the
same right of appeal must be accorded equally to the Occultists, instead
of remaining the monopoly of puzzled materialism. Physical man, we say,
existed before the first bed of the Cretaceous rocks was deposited. In
the early part of the Tertiary Age, the most brilliant civilization the
world has ever known flourished at a period when the Haeckelian
*man-ape* is conceived to have roamed through the primeval forests, and
Mr. Grant Allen's putative ancestor to have swung himself from bough to
bough with his hairy mates, the degenerated Liliths of the Third Race
Adam. Yet there were no anthropoid apes in the brighter days of the
civilization of the Fourth Race; but Karma is a mysterious law, and no
respecter of persons. The monsters bred in sin and shame by the
Atlantean giants, "*blurred copies*" of their bestial sires, and hence
of modern man (Huxley), now mislead and overwhelm with error the
speculative Anthropologist of European Science.

Where did the first men live? Some Darwinists say in Western Africa,
some in Southern Asia, others, again, believe in an independent origin
of human stocks in Asia and America from a Simian ancestry (Vogt).
Haeckel, however, advances gaily to the charge. Starting from his
"prosimiae" . . . "the ancestor common to all other catarrhini,
including man" -- a "link" now, however, disposed of for good by recent
anatomical discoveries! -- he endeavours to find a habitat for the
primeval Pithecanthropus alalus. "In all probability it (the
transformation of animal into man) occurred in Southern Asia, in which
region many evidences are forthcoming that here was the original home of
the different species of men. Probably Southern Asia itself was not the
earliest cradle of the human race, but **L**EMURIA, *a continent that
lay to the south of Asia, and sank later on beneath the surface of the
Indian Ocean.* (*Vide infra,* "Scientific and geological proofs of the
former existence of several

submerged continents.") "The period during which the evolution of the
anthropoid apes into apelike men took place was probably the last part
of the tertiary period, the Pliocene Age, and perhaps the Miocene, its
forerunner." (Pedigree of Man, p. 73.)

Of the above speculations, the only one of any worth is that referring
to Lemuria, which *was* the cradle of mankind -- of the physical sexual
creature who materialized through long aeons out of the ethereal
hermaphrodites. Only, if it is proved that *Easter Island* is an actual
relic of Lemuria, we must believe that according to Haeckel the "*dumb
ape-men*," just removed from a brutal mammalian monster, built the
gigantic portrait-statues, some of which are now in the British Museum.
Critics are mistaken in terming Haeckelian doctrines "abominable,
revolutionary, immoral" -- though materialism is the legitimate outcome
of the ape-ancestor myth -- they are simply too absurd to demand
disproof.

**M**AN AND  
THE **A**NTHROPOID IN **N**O **W**AY A **C**ONFIRMATION OF
**D**ARWINISM.

We are told that while every other heresy against modern science may be
disregarded, this, our denial of the Darwinian theory as applied to Man,
will be the one "unpardonable" sin. The Evolutionists stand firm as rock
on the evidence of similarity of structure between the ape and the man.
The anatomical evidence, it is urged, is quite overpowering in this
case; it is *bone for bone,* and *muscle for muscle,* even the brain
conformation being very much the same.

Well, what of that? All this was known before King Herod; and the
writers of the *Ramayana,* the poets who sang the prowess and valour of
Hanuman, the monkey-God, "whose feats were great and Wisdom never
rivalled," must have known as much about his anatomy and brain as does
any Haeckel or Huxley in our modern day. Volumes upon volumes were
written upon this similarity, in antiquity as in more modern times.
Therefore, there is nothing new whatever given to the world or to
philosophy, in such volumes as Mivart's "Man and Apes," or Messrs. Fiske
and Huxley's defence of Darwinism. But what are those *crucial* proofs
of man's descent from a pithecoid ancestor? If the Darwinian theory *is
not the true one --* we are told -- if man and ape do not descend from a
common ancestor, then we are called upon to explain the reason of: --

(I.) The similarity of structure between the two; the fact that the

------------------------------------------------------------------------

###### \[\[Vol. 2, Page 681\]\] HUXLEY CALLS THE DARWINISTS TO ORDER.

higher animal world -- man and beast -- is physically of one type or
pattern.

(II.) The presence of *rudimentary organs* in man, *i.e.*, traces of
former organs now atrophied by disuse. Some of these organs, it is
asserted, could not have had any scope for employment, except for a
semi-animal, semi-arboreal monster. Why, again, do we find in Man those
"rudimentary" organs (as useless as its rudimentary wing is to the
*Apteryx* of Australia), the vermiform appendix of the *coecum,* the ear
muscles,\* the "rudimentary tail" (with which children are still
sometimes born), etc., etc.?

Such is the war cry; and the cackle of the smaller fry among the
Darwinians is louder, if possible, than even that of the scientific
Evolutionists themselves!

Furthermore, the latter themselves -- with their great leader Mr.
Huxley, and such eminent zoologists as Mr. Romanes and others -- while
defending the Darwinian theory, are the first to confess the almost
insuperable difficulties in the way of its final demonstration. And
there are as great men of science as the above-named, who deny, most
emphatically, the uncalled-for assumption, and loudly denounce the
unwarrantable exaggerations on the question of this supposed similarity.
It is sufficient to glance at the works of Broca, Gratiolet, of Owen,
Pruner-Bey, and finally, at the last great work of de Quatrefages,
"*Introduction a l*'*Etude des Races humaines, Questions generales,*" to
discover the fallacy of the Evolutionists. We may say more: the
exaggerations concerning such similarity of structure between man and
the anthropomorphous ape have become so glaring and absurd of late, that
even Mr. Huxley found himself forced to protest against the too sanguine
expectations. It was that great anatomist personally who called the
"smaller fry" to order, by declaring in one of his articles that the
differences in the structure of the human body and that of the highest
anthropomorphous pithecoid, were not only *far from being trifling and
unimportant,* but were, on the contrary, very great and suggestive:
"each of the bones of the gorilla has its own specific impress on it
that distinguishes it from a similar human bone." Among the existing
creatures there is not one single intermediate form that could fill the
gap between man and the ape. To ignore that gap, he added, "was *as
uncalled-for as it was absurd.*"*\*\**

"animal progenitor" to solve it.

Finally, the absurdity of such an *unnatural* descent of man is so
palpable in the face of all the proofs and evidence of the skull of the
pithecoid as compared to that of man, that even de Quatrefages resorted
unconsciously to our esoteric theory by saying *that it is rather the
apes that can claim descent from man* than *vice versa.* As proven by
Gratiolet, with regard to the cavities of the brain of the anthropoids,
in which species that organ develops in an inverse ratio to what would
be the case were the corresponding organs in man really the product of
the development of the said organs in the apes -- the size of the human
skull and its brain, as well as the cavities, increase with the
individual development of man. His intellect develops and increases with
age, while his facial bones and jaws diminish and straighten, thus being
more and more spiritualized: whereas with the ape it is the reverse. In
its youth the anthropoid is far more intelligent and good-natured, while
with age it becomes duller; and, as its skull recedes and seems to
diminish as it grows, its facial bones and jaws develop, the brain being
finally crushed, and thrown entirely back, to make with every day more
room for the animal type. The organ of thought -- the brain -- recedes
and diminishes, entirely conquered and replaced by that of the wild
beast -- the jaw apparatus.

Thus, as wittily remarked in the French work, a gorilla would have a
perfect right to address an Evolutionist, claiming its right of descent
from himself. It would say to him, "We, anthropoid apes, form a
retrogressive departure from the human type, and therefore our
development and evolution are expressed by a transition from a
human-like to an animal-like structure of organism; but in what way
could *you,* men, descend from us -- how can you form a continuation of
our genus? For, to make this possible, your organization would have to
differ still more than ours does from the human structure, it would have
to approach still closer to that of the beast than ours does; and in
such a case justice demands that you should give up to us your place in
nature. You are lower than we are, once that you insist on tracing your
genealogy from our kind; for the structure of our organization and its
development are such that we are unable to generate forms of a higher
organization than our own."

This is where the Occult Sciences agree entirely with de Quatre-

this species is *still in the same low grade,* and *side by side* with
it at the end of the Ice-period, man is found in the same high grade as
to-day, the ape not having approximated more nearly to the man, and
modern man not having become further removed from the ape than the first
(fossil) man . . . these facts contradict a theory of constant
progressive development." (Pfaff.) When, according to Vogt, the the
average Australian brain = 99.35 cub. inches; that of the gorilla 30.51
cub. in., and that of the chimpanzee only 25.45, the *giant gap* to be
bridged by the advocate of "Natural" Selection becomes apparent.

fages. Owing to the very type of his development man *cannot descend*
from either an ape or an ancestor common to both, but shows his origin
from a type far superior to himself. And this type is the "Heavenly man"
-- the Dhyan Chohans, or the *Pitris* so-called, as shown in the first
Part of this volume. On the other hand, the pithecoids, the
orang-outang, the gorilla, and the chimpanzee *can*, and, as the Occult
Sciences teach, *do,* descend from the animalized Fourth human
Root-Race, being the product of man and an extinct species of mammal --
whose *remote* ancestors were themselves the product of Lemurian
bestiality -- which lived in the Miocene age. The ancestry of this
semi-human monster is explained in the Stanzas as originating in the sin
of the "Mind-less" races of the middle Third Race period.

When it is borne in mind that all forms which now people the earth, are
so many variations on *basic types* originally thrown off by the **M**AN
of the Third and Fourth Round, such an evolutionist argument as that
insisting on the "unity of structural plan" characterising all
vertebrates, loses its edge. The basic types referred to were very few
in number in comparison with the multitude of organisms to which they
ultimately gave rise; but a general unity of type has, nevertheless,
been preserved throughout the ages. The economy of Nature does not
sanction the co-existence of several utterly opposed "ground plans" of
organic evolution on one planet. Once, however, that the general drift
of the occult explanation is formulated, inference as to detail may well
be left to the intuitive reader.

Similarly with the important question of the "rudimentary" organs
discovered by anatomists in the human organism. Doubtless this line of
argument, when wielded by Darwin and Haeckel against their European
adversaries, proved of great weight. Anthropologists, who ventured to
dispute the derivation of man from an animal ancestry, were sorely
puzzled how to deal with the presence of gill-clefts, with the "tail"
problem, and so on. Here again Occultism comes to our assistance with
the necessary data.

The fact is that, as previously stated, the human type is the repertory
of all potential organic forms, and the central point from which these
latter radiate. In this postulate we find a true "*Evolution*" or
"*Unfolding*" *--* a sense which cannot be said to belong to the
mechanical theory of natural selection. Criticising Darwin's inference
from "rudiments," an able writer remarks: "Why is it not just as
probably a true hypothesis to suppose that Man was *created with the
rudimentary sketches in his organization, and that they became useful
appendages in the lower animals into which man degenerated,* as to
suppose that these parts existed in full development in the lower
animals out of which man was generated?" ("Creation or Evolution?" Geo.
T. Curtis, p. 76.)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

###### \[\[Vol. 2, Page\]\] 684 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.

Read for "into which Man degenerated," "the prototypes which man *shed*
in the course of his astral developments," and an aspect of the true
esoteric solution is before us. But a wider generalization is now to be
formulated.

So far as our present *Fourth Round* terrestrial period is concerned,
the mammalian fauna are alone to be regarded as traceable to prototypes
shed by Man. The amphibia, birds, reptiles, fishes, etc., are the
resultants of the Third Round, astral fossil forms stored up in the
auric envelope of the Earth and projected into physical objectivity
subsequent to the deposition of the first Laurentian rocks. "Evolution"
has to deal with the progressive modifications, which palaeontology
shows to have affected the lower animal and vegetable kingdoms in the
course of geological time. It does not, and from the nature of things
cannot, touch on the subject of the pre-physical types which served as
the basis for future differentiation. Tabulate the general laws
controlling the development of physical organisms it certainly may, and
to a certain extent it has acquitted itself ably of the task.

To return to the immediate subject of discussion. The mammalia, whose
first traces are discovered in the marsupials of the Triassic rocks of
the Secondary Period, were evolved from *purely* astral progenitors
contemporary with the Second Race. They are thus *post-Human,* and,
consequently, it is easy to account for the general resemblance between
their embryonic stages and those of Man, who necessarily embraces in
himself and epitomizes in his development the features of the group he
originated. This explanation disposes of a portion of the Darwinist
brief. "But how to account for the presence of the gill-clefts in the
human foetus, which represent the stage through which the branchiae of
the fish are developed;\* for the pulsating vessel corresponding to the
heart of the lower fishes, which constitutes the foetal heart; for the
entire analogy presented by the segmentation of the human ovum, the
formation of the blastoderm, and the appearance of the 'gastrula' stage,
with corresponding stages in lower vertebrate life and even among the
sponges; for the various types of lower animal life which the form of
the future child shadows forth in the cycle of its growth?" "How comes
it to pass that stages in the life of fishes, whose ancestors swam" --
aeons before the epoch of the First Root-Race,

\* "At this period," writes Darwin, "the arteries run in arch-like
branches, as if to carry the blood to branchiae which are not present in
the higher vertebrata, though the slits on the side of the neck still
remain, marking their former (?) position."

It is noteworthy that, though gill-clefts are absolutely useless to all
but amphibia and fishes, etc., their appearance is regularly noted in
the foetal development of vertebrates. Even children are occasionally
born with an opening in the neck corresponding to one of the clefts.

-- "in the seas of the Silurian period, as well as stages in that of the
later amphibian, reptilian fauna, are mirrored in the 'epitomized
history' of human foetal development?"

This plausible objection is met by the reply that the *Third Round*
terrestrial animal forms were just as much referable to types thrown off
by Third Round man, as that new importation into our planet's area --
the mammalian stock -- is to the Fourth Round Humanity of the Second
Root-race. The process of human foetal growth epitomizes not only the
general characteristics of the Fourth, but of the Third Round
terrestrial life. The diapason of type is run through in brief.
Occultists are thus at no loss to "account for" the birth of children
with an actual caudal appendage, or for the fact that the tail in the
human foetus is, at one period, double the length of the nascent legs.
The potentiality of every organ useful to animal life is locked up in
Man -- the microcosm of the Macrocosm -- and abnormal conditions may not
unfrequently result in the strange phenomena which Darwinists regard as
"reversion to ancestral features."\* Reversion, indeed, but scarcely in
the sense contemplated by our present-day empiricists!

AND THEIR **A**NCESTRY.

The public has been notified by more than one eminent modern geologist
and man of science, that "all estimate of geological duration is not
merely *impossible,* but necessarily imperfect; for we are ignorant of
the causes, though they must have existed, which quickened or retarded
the progress of the sedimentary deposits."\*\* And now another man of
Science, as well known (Croll), calculating that the tertiary age began
either 15 or 2 1/2 million of years ago -- the former being a more
correct calculation, according to Esoteric doctrine, than the latter
there -- seems in this case, at least, no very great disagreement. Exact
Science, refusing to see in man "a special creation" (to a certain
degree the Secret Sciences do the same), is at liberty to ignore the
first three, or rather two-and-a-half Races -- *the Spiritual, the
semi-astral, and the*

\* Those who with Haeckel regard the gill-clefts with their attendant
phenomena as illustrative of an active function in our amphibian and
piscine ancestors (Vide his **XII.** and **XIII**. stages), ought to
explain why the "*Vegetable with leaflets*" (Lefevre) represented in
foetal growth, does not appear in his 22 stages through which the monera
have passed in their ascent to Man. Haeckel does *not* postulate a
*vegetable* ancestor. The embryological argument is thus a two-edged
sword and here cuts its possessor.

*semi-human -*- of our teachings. But it can hardly do the same in the
case of the Third at its closing period, the Fourth, and the Fifth
Races, since it already divides mankind into Palaeolithic and Neolithic
man.\* The geologists of France place man in the mid-miocene age
(Gabriel de Mortillet), and some even in the *Secondary* period, as de
Quatrefages suggests; while the English *savants* do not generally
accept such antiquity for their species. But they may know better some
day. For "If we consider," says Sir Charles Lyell in "Antiquity of Man,"
p. 246 --

> "the absence or extreme scarcity of human bones and works of art in
> all strata, whether marine or fresh water, even in those formed in the
> immediate proximity of land inhabited by millions of human beings, we

> seas infested with icebergs, and if a few of them left their bones or
> weapons in moraines or in marine drifts, the chances, after the lapse
> of thousands of years, of a geologist meeting with one of them must be
> infinitesimally small."

The men of Science avoid pinning themselves down to any definite
statement concerning the age of man, as indeed they hardly could, and
thus leave enormous latitude to bolder speculations. Nevertheless, while
the majority of the Anthropologists carry back the existence of man
*only* into the period of the *post*-glacial drift, or what is called
the Quaternary period, those of them who, as *Evolutionists, trace man
to a common origin with that of the monkey,* do not show great
consistency in their speculations. The Darwinian hypothesis demands, in
reality, a far greater antiquity for man, than is even dimly suspected
by superficial thinkers. This is proven by the greatest authorities on
the question -- Mr. Huxley, for instance. Those, therefore, who accept
the Darwinian evolution, *ipso facto* hold very tenaciously to an
antiquity

###### \[\[Footnote(s)\]\] -------------------------------------------------

\* We confess to not being able to see any good reasons for Mr. E.
Clodd's certain statement in *Knowledge.* Speaking of the men of
Neolithic times, "concerning whom Mr. Grant Allen has given . . . a
vivid and accurate sketch," and who are "the direct ancestors of peoples
of whom remnants yet lurk in out-of-the-way corners of Europe, where
they have been squeezed or stranded," he adds to this: "but the men of
Palaeolithic times can be identified with no existing races; they were
savages of a more degraded type than any extant; tall, yet barely erect,
with short legs and twisted knees, with prognathous, that is, projecting
ape-like jaws, and small brains. Whence they come we cannot tell, and
their 'grave knoweth no man to this day.' "

Besides the possibility that there may be men who *know* whence they
came and how they perished -- it is not true to say that the
Palaeolithic men, or their fossils, are all found with "small brains."
The oldest skull of all those hitherto found, the "Neanderthal skull,"
is of average capacity, and Mr. Huxley was compelled to confess that it
was no real approximation whatever to that of the "missing link." There
are aboriginal tribes in India whose brains are far smaller and nearer
to that of the ape than any hitherto found among the skulls of
Palaeolithic man.

of man so very great, indeed, that it falls not so far short of the
Occultist's estimate.\* The modest thousands of years of the
*Encyclopaedia Britannica* and the 100,000 years, to which Anthropology
in general limits the age of Humanity, seem quite microscopical when
compared with the figures implied in Mr. Huxley's bold speculations. The
former, indeed, makes of the original race of men ape-like
cave-dwellers. The great English biologist, in his desire to prove man's
pithecoid origin, insists that the transformation of the primordial ape
into a human being must have occurred *millions of years back.* For in
criticising the excellent average cranial capacity of the Neanderthal
skull, notwithstanding his assertion that it is overlaid with "pithecoid
bony walls," coupled with Mr. Grant Allen's assurances that this skull
"possesses large bosses on the forehead, strikingly (?) suggestive of
those which give the gorilla its peculiarly fierce appearance,"\*\*
(*Fortnightly Review,* 1882,) still Mr. Huxley is forced to admit that,
in the said skull, his theory is once more defeated by the "completely
human proportions of the accompanying limb-bones, together with the fair
development of the Engis skull." In consequence of all this we are
notified that those skulls, "clearly indicate that the first traces of
the primordial stock whence man has proceeded, need no longer be sought
by those who entertain any form of the doctrine of progressive
development in the newest Tertiaries; but that they *may be looked for
in an epoch more distant from the age of the* ELEPHAS PRIMIGENIUS *than
that is from us*"*\*\*\** (Huxley).

###### \[\[Footnote(s)\]\] -------------------------------------------------

\* The *actual* time required for such a theoretical transformation is
necessarily enormous. "If," says Professor Pfaff, "in the hundreds of
thousands of years which you (the Evolutionists) accept between the rise
of palaeolithic man and our own day, a greater distance of man from the
brute is not demonstrable, (*the most ancient man was just as far
removed from the brute as the now living man*), what reasonable ground
can be advanced for believing that man has been developed from the
brute, and has receded further from it by infinitely small gradations."
. . . . "*The longer the interval of time placed between our times and
the so-called palaeolithic men, the more ominous and destructive for the
theory of the gradual development of man from the animal kingdom is the
result stated.*" Huxley states ("Man's Place in Nature," p. 159) that
the *most liberal* estimates for the antiquity of Man *must be still
further* extended.

\*\* The baselessness of this assertion, as well as that of many other
exaggerations of the imaginative Mr. Grant Allen, was ably exposed by
the eminent anatomist, Professor R. Owen, in "Longman's Magazine," No.
1. Must it be repeated, moreover, that the Cro-Magnon Palaeolithic type
is superior to a very large number of existing races?

\*\*\* It thus stands to reason that science would never dream of a
*pre*-tertiary man, and that de Quatrefages' *secondary* man makes every
Academician and "**F.R.S**." faint with horror because, TO PRESERVE THE
APE-THEORY, SCIENCE MUST MAKE MAN POST-SECONDARY. This is just what de
Quatrefages has twitted the Darwinists with, adding, that on the whole
there were more scientific reasons to trace the ape from man than man
from the anthropoid. With this exception science has not one single
valid argu- \[\[Footnote continued on next page\]\]

An *untold* antiquity for man is thus, then, the scientific *sine qua
non* in the question of Darwinian Evolution, since the oldest
Palaeolithic man shows as yet no appreciable differentiation from his
modern descendant. It is only of late that modern Science began to widen
with every year the abyss that now separates her from old Science, that
of the Plinies and Hippocrateses, none of whom would have derided the
archaic teachings with respect to the evolution of the human races and
animal species, as the present day Scientist -- geologist or
anthropologist -- is sure to do.

Holding, as we do, that the mammalian type was a post-human Fourth Round
product, the following diagram -- as the writer understands the teaching
-- may make the process clear: --

\[\[Footnote continued from previous page\]\] ment to offer against the
antiquity of man. But in this case modern Evolution demands far more
than the fifteen million years of Croll for the Tertiary period, for two
very simple but good reasons: (*a*) No anthropoid ape has been found
before the Miocene period: (*b*) man's flint relics have been traced to
the Pliocene and their presence *suspected,* if not accepted by all, in
the Miocene strata. Again, where is the "missing link" in such case? And
how could even a Palaeolithic Savage, a "Man of Canstadt," evolve into
*thinking* men from the brute Dryopithecus of the Miocene *in* *so short
a time.* One sees now the reason why Darwin rejected the theory that
only 60,000,000 years had elapsed since the Cambrian period. "He judges
from the small amount of organic changes since the glacial epoch, and
adds that the previous 140 million years can hardly be considered as
sufficient for the development of the varied forms of life which
certainly existed toward the close of the Cambrian period." (Ch. Gould.)

\* Let us remember in this connection the esoteric teaching which tells
us of Man having had in the Third Round a GIGANTIC APE-LIKE FORM on the
astral plane. And similarly at the close of the Third Race in this
Round. Thus it accounts for the *human* features of the apes, especially
of the later anthropoids -- apart from the fact that these latter
preserve by *Heredity* a resemblance to their Atlanto-Lemurian sires.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

###### \[\[Vol. 2, Page\]\] 689 THE INCUBUS OF ETHNOLOGY.

Man -- to develop the necessary barrier. Medical science records such
cases of monsters, bred from human and animal parents, even in our own
day. The possibility is, therefore, only one of *degree,* not of fact.
Thus it is that Occultism solves one of the strangest problems presented
to the consideration of the anthropologist.

The pendulum of thought oscillates between extremes. Having now finally
emancipated herself from the shackles of theology, Science has embraced
the opposite fallacy; and in the attempt to interpret Nature on purely
materialistic lines, she has built up that most extravagant theory of
the ages -- the derivation of man from a ferocious and brutal ape. So
rooted has this doctrine, in one form or another, now become, that the
most Herculean efforts will be needed to bring about its final
rejection. The Darwinian anthropology is the incubus of the ethnologist,
a sturdy child of modem Materialism, which has grown up and acquired
increasing vigour, as the ineptitude of the theological legend of Man's
"creation" became more and more apparent. It has thriven on account of
the strange delusion that -- as a scientist of repute puts it -- "All
hypotheses and theories with respect to the rise of man can be reduced
to *two* (the Evolutionist and the Biblical exoteric account) . . .
There is no other hypothesis conceivable . . . " !! The anthropology of
the secret volumes is, however, the best possible answer to such a
worthless contention.

The anatomical resemblance between Man and the higher Ape, so frequently
cited by Darwinists as pointing to some former ancestor common to both,
presents an interesting problem, the proper solution of which is to be
sought for in the esoteric explanation of the genesis of the pithecoid
stocks. We have given it as far as was useful, by stating that the
bestiality of the primeval mindless races resulted in the production of
huge man-like monsters -- the offspring of human and animal parents. As
time rolled on, and the still semi-astral forms consolidated into the
physical, the descendants of these creatures were modified by external
conditions, until the breed, dwindling in size, culminated in the lower
apes of the Miocene period. With these the later Atlanteans renewed the
sin of the "Mindless" -- this time with full responsibility. The
resultants of their crime were the species of apes now known as
Anthropoid.

It may be useful to compare this very simple theory -- and we are
willing to offer it even as a hypothesis to the unbelievers -- with the
Darwinian scheme, so full of insurmountable obstacles, that no sooner is
one of these overcome by a more or less ingenious hypothesis, than ten
worse difficulties are forthwith discovered behind the one disposed of.
