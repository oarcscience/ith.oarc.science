> "Gently to hear, kindly to judge."  
> -- **S**HAKESPEARE.

**S**INCE the appearance of Theosophical literature in England, it has
become customary to call its teachings "Esoteric Buddhism." And, having
become a habit -- as an old proverb based on daily experience has it --
"Error runs down an inclined plane, while Truth has to laboriously climb
its way up hill."

Old truisms are often the wisest. The human mind can hardly remain
entirely free from bias, and decisive opinions are often formed before a
thorough examination of a subject from all its aspects has been made.
This is said with reference to the prevailing double mistake (*a*) of
limiting Theosophy to Buddhism: and (*b*) of confounding the tenets of
the religious philosophy preached by Gautama, the Buddha, with the
doctrines broadly outlined in "Esoteric Buddhism." Any thing more
erroneous than this could be hardly imagined. It has enabled our enemies
to find an effective weapon against theosophy; because, as an eminent
Pali scholar very pointedly expressed it, there was in the volume named
"neither esotericism nor Buddhism." The esoteric truths, presented in
Mr. Sinnett's work, had ceased to be esoteric from the moment they were
made public; nor did it contain the religion of Buddha, but simply a few
tenets from a hitherto hidden teaching which are now supplemented by
many more, enlarged and explained in the present volumes. But even the
latter, though giving out many fundamental tenets *from the* **S**ECRET
**D**OCTRINE *of the East,* raise but a small corner of the dark veil.
For no one, not even the greatest living adept, would be permitted to,
or could -- even if he would -- give out promiscuously, to a mocking,
unbelieving world, that which has been so effectually concealed from it
for long aeons and ages.

"Esoteric Buddhism" was an excellent work with a very unfortunate

title, though it meant no more than does the title of this work, the
"**S**ECRET **D**OCTRINE." It proved unfortunate, because people are
always in the habit of judging things by their appearance, rather than
their meaning; and because the error has now become so universal, that
even most of the Fellows of the Theosophical Society have fallen victims
to the same misconception. From the first, however, protests were raised
by Brahmins and others against the title; and, in justice to myself, I
must add that "Esoteric Buddhism" was presented to me as a completed
volume, and that I was entirely unaware of the manner in which the
author intended to spell the word "Budh-ism."

This has to be laid directly at the door of those who, having been the
first to bring the subject under public notice, neglected to point out
the difference between "Buddhism" -- the religious system of ethics
preached by the Lord Gautama, and named after his title of Buddha, "the
Enlightened" -- and *Budha,* "Wisdom," or knowledge (*Vidya*), the
faculty of cognizing, from the Sanskrit root "Budh," *to know.* We
theosophists of India are ourselves the real culprits, although, at the
time, we did our best to correct the mistake. (See *Theosophist,* June,
1883.) To avoid this deplorable misnomer was easy; the spelling of the
word had only to be altered, and by common consent both pronounced and
written "Budhism," instead of "Buddhism." Nor is the latter term
correctly spelt and pronounced, as it ought to be called, in English,
Buddhaism, and its votaries "Buddhaists."

This explanation is absolutely necessary at the beginning of a work like
this one. The "Wisdom Religion" is the inheritance of all the nations,
the world over, though the statement was made in "Esoteric Buddhism"
(*Preface* to the original Edition) that "two years ago (*i.e.* 1883),
neither I *nor any other European living*, knew the alphabet of the
Science, here for the first time put into a scientific shape," etc. This
error must have crept in through inadvertence. For the present writer
knew all that which is "divulged" in "Esoteric Buddhism" -- and much
more -- *many years* before it became her duty (in 1880) to impart a
small portion of the Secret Doctrine to two *European* gentlemen, one of
whom was the author of "Esoteric Buddhism"; and surely the present
writer has the undoubted, though to her, rather equivocal, privilege of
being a European, by birth and education. Moreover, a considerable part
of the philosophy

expounded by Mr. Sinnett was taught in America, even before *Isis
Unveiled* was published, to two Europeans and to my colleague, Colonel
H. S. Olcott. Of the three teachers the latter gentleman has had, the
first was a Hungarian Initiate, the second an Egyptian, the third a
Hindu. As permitted, Colonel Olcott has given out some of this teaching
in various ways; if the other two have not, it has been simply because
they were not allowed: their time for public work having not yet come.
But for others it has, and the appearance of Mr. Sinnett's several
interesting books is a visible proof of the fact. It is above everything
important to keep in mind that no theosophical book acquires the least
additional value from pretended authority.

In etymology *Adi*, and *Adhi* Budha, the *one* (or the First) and
"Supreme Wisdom" is a term used by Aryasanga in his Secret treatises,
and now by all the mystic Northern Buddhists. It is a Sanskrit term, and
an appellation given by the earliest Aryans to the Unknown deity; the
word "Brahma" not being found in the Vedas and the early works. It means
the absolute Wisdom, and "Adi-bhuta" is translated "the primeval
uncreated cause of all" by Fitzedward Hall. AEons of untold duration
must have elapsed, before the epithet of Buddha was so humanized, so to
speak, as to allow of the term being applied to mortals and finally
appropriated to one whose unparalleled virtues and knowledge caused him
to receive the title of the "Buddha of Wisdom unmoved." *Bodha* means
the innate possession of divine intellect or "understanding"; "Buddha,"
the acquirement of it by personal efforts and merit; while *Buddhi* is
the faculty of cognizing the channel through which divine knowledge
reaches the "Ego," the discernment of good and evil, "divine conscience"
also; and "Spiritual Soul," which is the vehicle of *Atma.* "When
*Buddhi* absorbs our **E**GOtism (destroys it) with all its *Vikaras,*
Avalokiteshvara becomes manifested to us, and Nirvana, or *Mukti,* is
reached," "Mukti" being the same as Nirvana, *i.e.*, freedom from the
trammels of "Maya" or *illusion.* "Bodhi" is likewise the name of a
particular state of trance condition, called *Samadhi,* during which the
subject reaches the culmination of spiritual knowledge.

Unwise are those who, in their blind and, in our age, untimely hatred of
Buddhism, and, by re-action, of "Budhism," deny its esoteric teachings
(which are those also of the Brahmins), simply because the name

------------------------------------------------------------------------

###### \[\[Vol. 1, Page\]\] xx INTRODUCTORY.

suggests what to them, as Monotheists, are noxious doctrines. *Unwise*
is the correct term to use in their case. For the Esoteric philosophy is
alone calculated to withstand, in this age of crass and illogical
materialism, the repeated attacks on all and everything man holds most
dear and sacred, in his inner spiritual life. The true philosopher, the
student of the Esoteric Wisdom, entirely loses sight of personalities,
dogmatic beliefs and special religions. Moreover, Esoteric philosophy
reconciles all religions, strips every one of its outward, human
garments, and shows the root of each to be identical with that of every
other great religion. It proves the necessity of an absolute Divine
Principle in nature. It denies Deity no more than it does the Sun.
Esoteric philosophy has never rejected God in Nature, nor Deity as the
absolute and abstract *Ens.* It only refuses to accept any of the gods
of the so-called monotheistic religions, gods created by man in his own
image and likeness, a blasphemous and sorry caricature of the Ever
Unknowable. Furthermore, the records we mean to place before the reader
embrace the esoteric tenets of the whole world since the beginning of
our humanity, and Buddhistic occultism occupies therein only its
legitimate place, and no more. Indeed, the secret portions of the
"*Dan*" *or Jan-na*"*\** ("*Dhyan*") of Gautama's metaphysics -- grand
as they appear to one unacquainted with the tenets of the Wisdom
Religion of antiquity -- are but a very small portion of the whole. The
Hindu Reformer limited his public teachings to the purely moral and
physiological aspect of the Wisdom Religion, to Ethics and MAN alone.
Things "unseen and incorporeal," the mystery of Being outside our
terrestrial sphere, the great Teacher left entirely untouched in his
public lectures, reserving the hidden Truths for a select circle of his
Arhats. The latter received their Initiation at the famous Saptaparna
cave (the *Sattapanni* of Mahavansa) near Mount Baibhar (the Webhara of
the Pali MSS.). This cave was in Rajagriha, the ancient capital of
Mogadha, and was the *Cheta* cave of Fa-hian, as rightly suspected by
some archaeologists.\*\*

\* *Dan*, now become in modern Chinese and Tibetan phonetics *ch*'*an*,
is the general term for the esoteric schools, and their literature. In
the old books, the word Janna is defined as "to reform one's self by
meditation and knowledge," a second *inner* birth. Hence Dzan, *Djan*
phonetically, the "Book of *Dzyan*."

archaeologist, was the first, we believe, to discover it.

sophy of these teachings, once that they were transplanted from the
secret and sacred circle of the Arhats, during the course of their work
of proselytism, into a soil less prepared for metaphysical conceptions
than India; *i.e.*, once they were transferred into China, Japan, Siam,
and Burmah. How the pristine purity of these grand revelations was dealt
with may be seen in studying some of the so-called "esoteric" Buddhist
schools of antiquity in their modern garb, not only in China and other
Buddhist countries in general, but even in not a few schools in Thibet,
left to the care of uninitiated Lamas and Mongolian innovators.

Thus the reader is asked to bear in mind the very important difference
between *orthodox* Buddhism -- *i.e.*, the public teachings of Gautama
the Buddha, and his esoteric *Budhism.* His Secret Doctrine, however,
differed in no wise from that of the initiated Brahmins of his day. The
Buddha was a child of the Aryan soil; a born Hindu, a Kshatrya and a
disciple of the "twice born" (the initiated Brahmins) or Dwijas. His
teachings, therefore, could not be different from their doctrines, for
the whole Buddhist reform merely consisted in giving out a portion of
that which had been kept secret from every man outside of the
"enchanted" circle of Temple-Initiates and ascetics. Unable to teach
*all* that had been imparted to him -- owing to his pledges -- though he
taught a philosophy built upon the ground-work of the true esoteric
knowledge, the Buddha gave to the world only its *outward* material body
and kept its *soul* for his Elect. (See also Volume II.) Many Chinese
scholars among Orientalists have heard of the "Soul Doctrine." None seem
to have understood its real meaning and importance.

That doctrine was preserved secretly -- too secretly, perhaps -- within
the sanctuary. The mystery that shrouded its chief dogma and aspirations
-- Nirvana -- has so tried and irritated the curiosity of those scholars
who have studied it, that, unable to solve it logically and
satisfactorily by untying the Gordian knot, they cut it through, by
declaring that Nirvana meant *absolute annihilation.*

Toward the end of the first quarter of this century, a distinct class of
literature appeared in the world, which became with every year more
defined in its tendency. Being based, *soi-disant,* on the scholarly
researches of Sanskritists and Orientalists in general, it was held
scientific. Hindu, Egyptian, and other ancient religions, myths, and
emblems were made to yield anything the symbologist wanted them to

------------------------------------------------------------------------

###### \[\[Vol. 1, Page\]\] xxii INTRODUCTORY.

yield, thus often giving out the rude *outward* form in place of the
*inner* meaning. Works, most remarkable for their ingenious deductions
and speculations, in *circulo vicioso,* foregone conclusions generally
changing places with premisses as in the syllogisms of more than one
Sanskrit and Pali scholar, appeared rapidly in succession, over-flooding
the libraries with dissertations rather on phallic and sexual worship
than on real symbology, and each contradicting the other.

This is the true reason, perhaps, why the outline of a few fundamental
truths from the Secret Doctrine of the Archaic ages is now permitted to
see the light, after long millenniums of the most profound silence and
secrecy. I say "a *few* truths," advisedly, because that which must
remain unsaid could not be contained in a hundred such volumes, nor
could it be imparted to the present generation of Sadducees. But, even
the little that is now given is better than complete silence upon those
vital truths. The world of to-day, in its mad career towards the unknown
-- which it is too ready to confound with the unknowable, whenever the
problem eludes the grasp of the physicist -- is rapidly progressing on
the reverse, material plane of spirituality. It has now become a vast
arena -- a true valley of discord and of eternal strife -- a necropolis,
wherein lie buried the highest and the most holy aspirations of our
Spirit-Soul. That soul becomes with every new generation more paralyzed
and atrophied. The "amiable infidels and accomplished profligates" of
Society, spoken of by Greeley, care little for the revival of the *dead*
sciences of the past; but there is a fair minority of earnest students
who are entitled to learn the few truths that may be given to them now;
and *now* much more than ten years ago, when "Isis Unveiled," or even
the later attempts to explain the mysteries of esoteric science, were
published.

One of the greatest, and, withal, the most serious objection to the
correctness and reliability of the whole work will be the preliminary
**S**TANZAS: "How can the statements contained in them be verified?"
True, if a great portion of the Sanskrit, Chinese, and Mongolian works
quoted in the present volumes are known to some Orientalists, the chief
work -- that one from which the Stanzas are given -- is not in the
possession of European Libraries. The Book of Dzyan (or "Dzan") is
utterly unknown to our Philologists, or at any rate was never heard of
by them under its present name. This is, of course, a great drawback

------------------------------------------------------------------------

###### \[\[Vol. 1, Page\]\] xxiii INTRODUCTORY.

to those who follow the methods of research prescribed by official
Science; but to the students of Occultism, and to every genuine
Occultist, this will be of little moment. The main body of the Doctrines
given is found scattered throughout hundreds and thousands of Sanskrit
**MSS**., some already translated -- disfigured in their
interpretations, as usual, -- others still awaiting their turn. Every
scholar, therefore, has an opportunity of verifying the statements
herein made, and of checking most of the quotations. A few new facts
(*new* to the profane Orientalist, only) and passages quoted from the
Commentaries will be found difficult to trace. Several of the teachings,
also, have hitherto been transmitted orally: yet even those are in every
instance hinted at in the almost countless volumes of Brahminical,
Chinese and Tibetan temple-literature.

However it may be, and whatsoever is in store for the writer through
malevolent criticism, one fact is quite certain. The members of several
esoteric schools -- the seat of which is beyond the Himalayas, and whose
ramifications may be found in China, Japan, India, Tibet, and even in
Syria, besides South America -- claim to have in their possession the
*sum total* of sacred and philosophical works in **MSS**. and type: all
the works, in fact, that have ever been written, in whatever language or
characters, since the art of writing began; from the ideographic
hieroglyphs down to the alphabet of Cadmus and the Devanagari.

It has been claimed in all ages that ever since the destruction of the
Alexandrian Library (see *Isis Unveiled,* Vol. II., p. 27), every work
of a character that might have led the profane to the ultimate discovery
and comprehension of some of the mysteries of the Secret Science, was,
owing to the combined efforts of the members of the Brotherhoods,
diligently searched for. It is added, moreover, by those who know, that
once found, save three copies left and stored safely away, such works
were all destroyed. In India, the last of the precious manuscripts were
secured and hidden during the reign of the Emperor Akbar.\*

It is maintained, furthermore, that every sacred book of that kind,
whose text was not sufficiently veiled in symbolism, or which had any

\* Prof. Max Muller shows that no bribes or threats of Akbar could
extort from the Brahmans the original text of the Veda; and boasts that
European Orientalists have it (*Lecture on the* "*Science of Religion,*"
p. 23). Whether Europe has the *complete text* is very doubtful, and the
future may have very disagreeable surprises in store for the
Orientalists.

direct references to the ancient mysteries, after having been carefully
copied in cryptographic characters, such as to defy the art of the best
and cleverest palaeographer, was also destroyed to the last copy. During
Akbar's reign, some fanatical courtiers, displeased at the Emperor's
sinful prying into the religions of the infidels, themselves helped the
Brahmans to conceal their **MSS.** Such was Badaoni, who had an
*undisguised horror* for Akbar's mania for idolatrous religions.\*

Moreover in all the large and wealthy lamasaries, there are subterranean
crypts and *cave-libraries,* cut in the rock, whenever the *gonpa* and
the *lhakhang* are situated in the mountains. Beyond the Western
Tsay-dam, in the solitary passes of *Kuen-lun\*\** there are several
such hiding places. Along the ridge of Altyn-Toga, whose soil no
European foot has ever trodden so far, there exists a certain hamlet,
lost in a deep gorge. It is a small cluster of houses, a hamlet rather
than a monastery, with a poor-looking temple in it, with one old lama, a
hermit, living near by to watch it. Pilgrims say that the subterranean
galleries and halls under it contain a collection of books, the number
of which, according to the accounts given, is too large to find room
even in the British Museum.\*\*\*

All this is very likely to provoke a smile of doubt. But then, before

\* Badaoni wrote in his *Muntakhab at Tawarikh:* "His Majesty relished
inquiries into the sects of these infidels (who cannot be counted, so
numerous they are, and who have no end of *revealed books*) . . . As
they (the Sramana and Brahmins) surpass other learned men in their
treatises on morals, on physical and religious sciences, and reach a
high degree *in their knowledge of the future*, in spiritual power, and
human perfection, they brought proofs based on reason and testimony, and
inculcated their doctrines so firmly that no man could now raise a doubt
in his Majesty even if mountains were to crumble to dust, or the heavens
were to tear asunder." This work "was kept secret, and was not published
till the reign of Jahangir." (Ain i Akbari, translated by Dr. Blochmann,

At present, hardly a few verdant oases relieve its dead solitude. One
such, sprung on the sepulchre of a vast city swallowed by and buried
under the sandy soil of the desert, belongs to no one, but is often
visited by Mongolians and Buddhists. The same tradition speaks of
immense subterranean abodes, of large corridors filled with tiles and

the reader rejects the truthfulness of the reports, let him pause and
reflect over the following well known facts. The collective researches
of the Orientalists, and especially the labours of late years of the
students of comparative Philology and the Science of Religions have led
them to ascertain as follows: An immense, incalculable number of
**MSS**., and even printed works *known to have existed*, *are now to be
found no more.* They have disappeared without leaving the slightest
trace behind them. Were they works of no importance they might, in the
natural course of time, have been left to perish, and their very names
would have been obliterated from human memory. But it is not so; for, as
now ascertained, most of them contained the true keys to works still
extant, and *entirely incomprehensible,* for the greater portion of
their readers, *without those additional volumes of Commentaries and
explanations.* Such are, for instance, the works of Lao-tse, the
predecessor of Confucius.\*

He is said to have written 930 books on Ethics and religions, and
*seventy* on magic, *one thousand in all.* His great work, however, the
*heart* of his doctrine, the "Tao-te-King," or the sacred scriptures of
the *Taosse,* has in it, as Stanislas Julien shows, only "about 5,000
words" (*Tao-te-King,* p. xxvii.), hardly a dozen of pages, yet
Professor Max Muller finds that "the text is unintelligible without
commentaries, so that Mr. Julien had to consult more than sixty
commentators for the purpose of his translation," the earliest going
back as far as the year 163 **B.C**., *not earlier,* as we see. During
the four centuries and a half that preceded this *earliest* of the
commentators there was ample time to veil the true Lao-tse doctrine from
all but his initiated priests. The Japanese, among whom are now to be
found the most learned of the priests and followers of Lao-tse, simply
laugh at the blunders and hypotheses of the European Chinese scholars;
and tradition affirms that the commentaries to which our Western
Sinologues have access are not the *real occult* records, but
intentional veils, and that the true commentaries, as well as almost all
the texts, have long since *disappeared* from the eyes of the profane.

###### \[\[Footnote(s)\]\] -------------------------------------------------

\* "If we turn to China, we find that the religion of Confucius is
founded on the Five *King* and the Four *Shu*-books, in themselves of
considerable extent and surrounded by voluminous Commentaries, without
which even the most learned scholars would not venture to fathom *the
depth of their sacred canon.*" (*Lectures on the* "*Science of
Religion,*" p. 185. Max Muller.) But they have not fathomed it -- and
this is the complaint of the Confucianists, as a very learned member of
that body, in Paris, complained in 1881.

If one turns to the ancient literature of the Semitic religions, to the
Chaldean Scriptures, the elder sister and instructress, if not the
fountain-head of the Mosaic Bible, the basis and starting-point of
Christianity, what do the scholars find? To perpetuate the memory of the
ancient religions of Babylon; to record the vast cycle of astronomical
observations of the Chaldean Magi; to justify the tradition of their
splendid and eminently occult literature, what now remains? -- only a
few fragments, *said to be by* Berosus.

These, however, are almost valueless, even as a clue to the character of
what has disappeared. For they passed through the hands of his Reverence
the Bishop of Caesarea -- that self-constituted censor and editor of the
sacred records of other men's religions -- and they doubtless bear to
this day the mark of his eminently veracious and trustworthy hand. For
what is the history of this treatise on the once grand religion of
Babylon?

Written in Greek by Berosus, a priest of the temple of Belus, for
Alexander the Great, from the astronomical and chronological records
preserved by the priests of that temple, and covering a period of
200,000 years, it is now lost. In the first century **B.C**. Alexander
Polyhistor made a series of extracts from it -- *also lost.* Eusebius
used these extracts in writing his *Chronicon* (270-340 **A.D**.). The
points of resemblance -- almost of identity -- between the Jewish and
the Chaldean Scriptures,\* made the latter most dangerous to Eusebius,
in his *role* of defender and champion of the new faith which had
adopted the Jewish Scriptures, and with them an absurd chronology. It is
pretty certain that Eusebius did not spare the Egyptian Synchronistic
tables of Manetho -- so much so that Bunsen\*\* charges him with
mutilating history most unscrupulously. And Socrates, a historian of the
fifth century, and Syncellus, vice-patriarch of Constantinople (eighth
century), both denounce him as the most daring and desperate forger.

Is it likely, then, that he dealt more tenderly with the Chaldean
records, which were already menacing the new religion, so rashly
accepted?

Revelation!*

So that, with the exception of these more than doubtful fragments, the
entire Chaldean sacred literature has disappeared from the eyes of the
profane as completely as the lost Atlantis. A few facts that were
contained in the Berosian History are given in Part II. of Vol. II., and
may throw a great light on the true origin of the Fallen Angels,
personified by Bel and the Dragon.

Turning now to the oldest Aryan literature, the Rig-Veda, the student
will find, following strictly in this the data furnished by the said
Orientalists themselves, that, although the Rig-Veda contains only
"about 10,580 verses, or 1,028 hymns," in spite of the Brahmanas and the
mass of glosses and commentaries, it is not understood correctly to this
day. Why is this so? Evidently because the Brahmanas, "the scholastic
and oldest treatises on the primitive hymns," *themselves require a
key,* which the Orientalists have failed to secure.

What do the scholars say of Buddhist literature? Have they got it in its
completeness? Assuredly not. Notwithstanding the 325 volumes of the
*Kanjur* and the *Tanjur* of the Northern Buddhists, each volume we are
told, "weighing from four to five pounds," nothing, in truth, is known
of Lamaism. Yet, the sacred canon of the Southern Church is said to
contain 29,368,000 letters in the Saddharma alankara,\* or, exclusive of
treatises and commentaries, "five or six times the amount of the matter
contained in the Bible," the latter, in the words of Professor Max
Muller, rejoicing only in 3,567,180 letters. Notwithstanding, then,
these "325 volumes" (*in reality* there are 333, *Kanjur* comprising
108, and *Tanjur* 225 volumes), "the translators, instead of supplying
us with correct versions, have interwoven them *with their own
commentaries*, for the purpose of justifying the dogmas of their several
schools."\*\* Moreover, "according to a tradition preserved by the
Buddhist schools, both of the South and of the North, the sacred
Buddhist Canon comprised originally 80,000 or 84,000 tracts, *but most
of them were lost*, so that there remained but 6,000," the professor
tells his audiences. "Lost" as usual for Europeans. But who can be quite
sure that they are likewise lost for Buddhists and Brahmins?

Considering the sacredness for the Buddhists of every line written

upon Buddha or his "Good Law," the loss of nearly 76,000 *tracts* does
seem miraculous. Had it been *vice versa,* every one acquainted with the
natural course of events would subscribe to the statement that, of these
76,000, five or six thousand treatises *might have been* destroyed
during the persecutions in, and emigrations from, India. But as it is
well ascertained that Buddhist Arhats began their religious exodus, for
the purpose of propagating the new faith beyond Kashmir and the
Himalayas, as early as the year 300 before our era,\* and reached China
in the year 61 **A.D**.\*\* when Kashyapa, at the invitation of the
Emperor Ming-ti, went there to acquaint the "Son of Heaven" with the
tenets of Buddhism, it does seem strange to hear the Orientalists
speaking of such a loss as though it were really possible. They do not
seem to allow for one moment the possibility that the texts may be
*lost* only for West and *for themselves*; or, that the Asiatic people
should have the unparalleled boldness to keep their most sacred records
out of the reach of foreigners, thus refusing to deliver them to the
profanation and misuse of races even so "vastly superior" to themselves.

Owing to the expressed regrets and numerous confessions of almost every
one of the Orientalists (See Max Muller's *Lectures* for example) the
public may feel sufficiently sure (*a*) that the students of ancient
religions have indeed very few data upon which to build such final
conclusions as they generally do about the old religions, and (*b*) that
such lack of data does not prevent them in the least from dogmatising.
One would imagine that, thanks to the numerous records of the Egyptian
theogony and mysteries preserved in the classics, and in a number of
ancient writers, the rites and dogmas of Pharaonic Egypt ought to be
well understood at least; better, at any rate, than the too abstruse
philosophies and Pantheism of India, of whose religion and language
Europe had hardly any idea before the beginning of the present century.
Along the Nile and on the face of the whole country, there stand to this
hour, exhumed yearly and daily, fresh relics which eloquently tell their
own history. Still it is not so. The learned Oxford philologist himself

the sacred books of the Egyptians; yet, though much has been deciphered
in the ancient records of that mysterious race, the mainspring of the
religion of Egypt and the original intention of its ceremonial worship
*are* *far from being fully* disclosed to us."\* Here again the
mysterious hieroglyphic documents remain, but the keys by which alone
they become intelligible have disappeared.

Nevertheless, having found that "there is a natural connection between
language and religion"; and, secondly, that there was a *common* Aryan
religion before the separation of the Aryan race; a *common* Semitic
religion before the separation of the Semitic race; and a *common*
Turanian religion before the separation of the Chinese and the other
tribes belonging to the Turanian class; having, in fact, only discovered
"three ancient centres of religion" and "three centres of language," and
though as entirely ignorant of those primitive religions and languages,
as of their origin, the professor does not hesitate to declare "that a
truly *historical basis* for a scientific treatment of those principal
religions of the world has been gained!"

A "scientific treatment" of a subject is no guarantee for its
"historical basis"; and with such scarcity of data on hand, no
philologist, even among the most eminent, is justified in giving out his
own conclusions for *historical* facts*.* No doubt, the eminent
Orientalist has proved thoroughly to the world's satisfaction, that
according to Grimm's law of phonetic rules, Odin and Buddha are two
different personages, quite distinct from each other, and he has shown
it *scientifically.* When, however, he takes the opportunity of saying
in the same breath that Odin "was worshipped as the supreme deity
*during a period long anterior to the age of the Veda* and of Homer"
(*Compar. Theol.,* p. 318), he has not the slightest "*historical*
basis" for it. He makes *history* and *fact* subservient to his

Only a year or two since, one of that kind was discovered at Boulaq,
Cairo. The mummy of what had been considered the wife of an unimportant

own conclusions, which may be very "scientific," in the sight of
Oriental scholars, but yet very wide of the mark of actual truth. The
conflicting views on the subject of chronology, in the case of the
Vedas, of the various eminent philologists and Orientalists, from Martin
Haug down to Mr. Max Muller himself, are an evident proof that the
statement has no *historical* basis to stand upon, "internal evidence"
being very often a jack-o'lantern, instead of a safe beacon to follow.
Nor has the Science of modern Comparative Mythology any better proof to
show, that those learned writers, who have insisted for the last century
or so that there must have been "fragments of a primeval revelation,
granted to the ancestors of the whole race of mankind . . . . preserved
in the temples of Greece and Italy," were entirely wrong. For this is
what all the Eastern Initiates and Pundits have been proclaiming to the
world from time to time. While a prominent Cinghalese priest assured the
writer that it was well known that the most important Buddhist tracts
belonging to the sacred canon were stored away in *countries and places
inaccessible to the European pundits*, the late Swami Dayanand
Sarasvati, the greatest Sanskritist of his day in India, assured some
members of the Theosophical Society of the same fact with regard to
ancient Brahmanical works. When told that Professor Max Muller had
declared to the audiences of his "Lectures" that the theory . . . .
"that *there was a primeval preternatural revelation* granted to the
fathers of the human race, finds but few supporters at present," -- the
holy and learned man laughed. His answer was suggestive. "If Mr. *Moksh
Mooller*, as he pronounced the name, were a Brahmin, and came with me, I
might take him to a *gupta* cave (a secret crypt) near Okhee Math, in
the Himalayas, where he would soon find out that what crossed the
*Kalapani* (the black waters of the ocean) from India to Europe were
only the *bits of rejected copies of some passages from our sacred
books.* There *was* a "primeval revelation," and it still exists; nor
will it ever be lost to the world, but will reappear; though the
Mlechchhas will of course have to wait."

Questioned further on this point, he would say no more. This was at
Meerut, in 1880.

No doubt the mystification played, in the last century at Calcutta, by
the Brahmins upon Colonel Wilford and Sir William Jones was a cruel one.
But it had been well deserved, and no one was more to be blamed

in that affair than the Missionaries and Colonel Wilford themselves. The
former, on the testimony of Sir William Jones himself (see Asiat. Res.,
Vol. I., p. 272), were silly enough to maintain that "the Hindus were
even now almost Christians, because their Brahma, Vishnu and Mahesa were
no other than the Christian trinity."\* It was a good lesson. It made
the Oriental scholars doubly cautious; but perchance it has also made
some of them too shy, and caused, in its reaction, the pendulum of
foregone conclusions to swing too much the other way. For "that first
supply on the Brahmanical market," made for Colonel Wilford, has now
created an evident necessity and desire in the Orientalists to declare
nearly every archaic Sanskrit manuscript so modern as to give to the
missionaries full justification for availing themselves of the
opportunity. That they do so and to the full extent of their mental
powers, is shown by the absurd attempts of late to prove that the whole
Puranic story about Chrishna was *plagiarized by the Brahmins from the
Bible!* But the facts cited by the Oxford Professor in his Lectures on
the "*Science of Religion*," concerning the now famous interpolations,
for the benefit, and later on to the sorrow, of Col. Wilford, do not at
all interfere with the conclusions to which one who studies the Secret
Doctrine must unavoidably come. For, if the results show that neither
the *New* nor even the *Old* Testament borrowed anything from the more
ancient religion of the Brahmans and Buddhists, it does not follow that
the Jews have not borrowed all they knew from the Chaldean records, the
latter being mutilated later on by Eusebius. As to the Chaldeans, they
assuredly got their primitive learning from the Brahmans, for Rawlinson
shows an undeniably Vedic influence in the early mythology of Babylon;
and Col. Vans Kennedy has long since justly declared that Babylonia was,
from her origin, the seat of Sanskrit and Brahman learning. But all such
proofs must lose their value, in the presence of the latest theory
worked out by Prof. Max Muller. What it is everyone knows. The code of
phonetic laws has now become a universal solvent for every
identification and "connection" between

the gods of many nations. Thus, though the Mother of Mercury (Budha,
Thot-Hermes, etc.), was Maia, the mother of Buddha (Gautama), also Maya,
and the mother of Jesus, likewise Maya (illusion, for Mary is *Mare,*
the Sea, the great illusion symbolically) -- yet these three characters
have no connection, nor can they have any, since Bopp, has "laid down
his code of phonetic laws."

In their efforts to collect together the many skeins of unwritten
history, it is a bold step for our Orientalists to take, to deny, *a
priori,* everything that does not dovetail with their special
conclusions. Thus, while new discoveries are daily made of great arts
and sciences having existed far back in the night of time, even the
knowledge of writing is refused to some of the most ancient nations, and
they are credited with barbarism instead of culture. Yet the traces of
an immense civilization, even in Central Asia, are still to be found.
This civilization is undeniably *prehistoric.* And how can there be
civilization without a literature, in some form, without annals or
chronicles? Common sense alone ought to supplement the broken links in
the history of departed nations. The gigantic, unbroken wall of the
mountains that hem in the whole table-land of Tibet, from the upper
course of the river Khuan-Khe down to the Kara-Korum hills, witnessed a
civilization during millenniums of years, and would have strange secrets
to tell mankind. The Eastern and Central portions of those regions --
the Nan-Schayn and the Altyne-taga -- were once upon a time covered with
cities that could well vie with Babylon. A whole geological period has
swept over the land, since those cities breathed their last, as the
mounds of shifting sand, and the sterile and now dead soil of the
immense central plains of the basin of Tarim testify. The borderlands
alone are superficially known to the traveller. Within those table-lands
of sand there is water, and fresh oases are found blooming there,
wherein no European foot has ever yet ventured, or trodden the now
treacherous soil. Among these verdant oases there are some which are
entirely inaccessible even to the native profane traveller. Hurricanes
may "tear up the sands and sweep whole plains away," they are powerless
to destroy that which is beyond their reach. Built deep in the bowels of
the earth, the subterranean stores are secure; and as their entrances
are concealed in such oases, there is little fear that any one should
discover them, even should several armies invade the sandy wastes where

But there is no need to send the reader across the desert, when the same
proofs of ancient civilization are found even in comparatively populated
regions of the same country. The oasis of Tchertchen, for instance,
situated about 4,000 feet above the level of the river
Tchertchen-D'arya, is surrounded with the ruins of archaic towns and
cities in every direction. There, some 3,000 human beings represent the
relics of about a hundred extinct nations and races -- the very names of
which are now unknown to our ethnologists. An anthropologist would feel
more than embarrassed to class, divide and subdivide them; the more so,
as the respective descendants of all these *antediluvian* races and
tribes know as little of their own forefathers themselves, as if they
had fallen from the moon. When questioned about their origin, they reply
that they know not whence their fathers had come, but had heard that
their *first* (or earliest) men were ruled by the great genii of these
deserts. This may be put down to ignorance and superstition, yet in view
of the teachings of the Secret Doctrine, the answer may be based upon
primeval tradition. Alone, the tribe of Khoorassan claims to have come
from what is now known as Afghanistan, long before the days of
Alexander, and brings legendary lore to that effect as corroboration.
The Russian traveller, Colonel (now General) Prjevalsky, found quite
close to the oasis of Tchertchen, the ruins of two enormous cities, the
oldest of which was, according to local tradition, ruined 3,000 years
ago by a hero and giant; and the other by the Mongolians in the tenth
century of our era. "The emplacement of the two cities is now covered,
owing to shifting sands and the desert wind, with strange and
heterogeneous relics; with broken china and kitchen utensils and human
bones. The natives often find copper and gold coins, melted silver,
ingots, diamonds, and turquoises, and what is the most remarkable --
broken glass. . . . ." "Coffins of some undecaying wood, or material,
also, within which beautifully preserved embalmed bodies are found. . .
. . The male mummies are all extremely tall powerfully built men with
long waving hair. . . . . A vault was found with twelve dead men
*sitting* in it. Another time, in a separate coffin, a young girl was
discovered by us. Her eyes were closed with golden discs, and the jaws
held firm by a golden circlet running from under the chin across the top
of the head. Clad in a narrow

woollen garment, her bosom was covered with golden stars, the feet being
left naked." (From a lecture by N. M. Prjevalsky.) To this, the famous
traveller adds that all along their way on the river Tchertchen they
heard legends about twenty-three towns buried ages ago by the shifting
sands of the deserts. The same tradition exists on the Lob-nor and in
the oasis of Kerya.

The traces of such civilization, and these and like traditions, give us
the right to credit other legendary lore warranted by well educated and
learned natives of India and Mongolia, when they speak of immense
libraries reclaimed from the sand, together with various reliques of
ancient **MAGIC** lore, which have all been safely stowed away.

To recapitulate. The Secret Doctrine was the universally diffused
religion of the ancient and prehistoric world. Proofs of its diffusion,
authentic records of its history, a complete chain of documents, showing
its character and presence in every land, together with the teaching of
all its great adepts, exist to this day in the secret crypts of
libraries belonging to the Occult Fraternity.

This statement is rendered more credible by a consideration of the
following facts: the tradition of the thousands of ancient parchments
saved when the Alexandrian library was destroyed; the thousands of
Sanskrit works which disappeared in India in the reign of Akbar; the
universal tradition in China and Japan that the true old texts with the
commentaries, which alone make them comprehensible -- amounting to many
thousands of volumes -- have long passed out of the reach of profane
hands; the disappearance of the vast sacred and occult literature of
Babylon; the loss of those keys which alone could solve the thousand
riddles of the Egyptian hieroglyphic records; the tradition in India
that the real secret commentaries which alone make the Veda
intelligible, though no longer visible to profane eyes, still remain for
the initiate, hidden in secret caves and crypts; and an identical belief
among the Buddhists, with regard to their secret books.

The Occultists assert that all these exist, safe from Western spoliating
hands, to re-appear in some more enlightened age, for which in the words
of the late Swami Dayanand Sarasvati, "the Mlechchhas (outcasts,
savages, those beyond the pale of Aryan civilization) will have to
wait."

For it is not the fault of the initiates that these documents are now
"lost" to the profane; nor was their policy dictated by selfishness, or

###### \[\[Vol. 1, Page\]\] xxxv INTRODUCTORY.

any desire to monopolise the life-giving sacred lore. There were
portions of the Secret Science that for incalculable ages had to remain
concealed from the profane gaze. But this was because to impart to the
unprepared multitude secrets of such tremendous importance, was
equivalent to giving a child a lighted candle in a powder magazine.

The answer to a question which has frequently arisen in the minds of
students, when meeting with statements such as this, may be outlined
here.

"We can understand," they say, "the necessity for concealing from the
herd such secrets as the Vril, or the rock-destroying force, discovered
by J. W. Keely, of Philadelphia, but we cannot understand how any danger
could arise from the revelation of such a purely philosophic doctrine,
as, *e.g*., the evolution of the planetary chains."

The danger was this: Doctrines such as the planetary chain, or the seven
races, at once give a clue to the seven-fold nature of man, for each
principle is correlated to a plane, a planet, and a race; and the human
principles are, on every plane, correlated to seven-fold occult forces
-- those of the higher planes being of tremendous power. So that any
septenary division at once gives a clue to tremendous occult powers, the
abuse of which would cause incalculable evil to humanity. A clue, which
is, perhaps, no clue to the present generation -- especially the
Westerns -- protected as they are by their very blindness and ignorant
materialistic disbelief in the occult; but a clue which would,
nevertheless, have been very real in the early centuries of the
Christian era, to people fully convinced of the reality of occultism,
and entering a cycle of degradation, which made them rife for abuse of
occult powers and sorcery of the worst description.

The documents were concealed, it is true, but the knowledge itself and
its actual existence had never been made a secret of by the Hierophants
of the Temple, wherein **M**YSTERIES have ever been made a discipline
and stimulus to virtue. This is very old news, and was repeatedly made
known by the great adepts, from Pythagoras and Plato down to the
Neoplatonists. It was the new religion of the Nazarenes that wrought a
change for the worse -- in the policy of centuries.

Moreover, there is a well-known fact, a very curious one, corroborated
to the writer by a reverend gentleman attached for years to a Russian
Embassy -- namely, that there are several documents in the St. Peters-

burg Imperial Libraries to show that, even so late as during the days
when Freemasonry, and Secret Societies of Mystics flourished unimpeded
in Russia, *i.e.*, at the end of the last and the beginning of the
present century, more than one Russian Mystic travelled to Tibet *via*
the Ural mountains in search of knowledge and initiation *in the unknown
crypts of Central Asia.* And more than one returned years later, with a
rich store of such information as could never have been given him
anywhere in Europe. Several cases could be cited, and well-known names
brought forward, but for the fact that such publicity might annoy the
surviving relatives of the said late Initiates. Let any one look over
the Annals and History of Freemasonry in the archives of the Russian
metropolis, and he will assure himself of the fact stated.

This is a corroboration of that which has been stated many times before,
and, unfortunately, too indiscreetly. Instead of benefiting humanity,
the virulent charges of deliberate invention and imposture with a
purpose thrown at those who asserted but a truthful, if even a little
known fact, have only generated bad Karma for the slanderers. But now
the mischief is done, and truth should no longer be denied, whatever the
consequences. Is it a new religion, we are asked? By no means; it is not
a *religion,* nor is its philosophy *new*; for, as already stated, it is
as old as thinking man. Its tenets are not now published for the first
time, but have been cautiously given out to, and taught by, more than
one European Initiate -- especially by the late Ragon.

More than one great scholar has stated that there never was a religious
founder, whether Aryan, Semitic or Turanian, who had *invented* a new
religion, or revealed a new truth. These founders were all
*transmitters,* not original teachers. They were the authors of new
forms and interpretations, while the truths upon which the latter were
based were as old as mankind. Selecting one or more of those grand
verities -- actualities visible only to the eye of the real Sage and
Seer -- out of the many orally revealed to man in the beginning,
preserved and perpetuated in the *adyta* of the temples through
initiation, during the **M**YSTERIES and by personal transmission --
they revealed these truths to the masses. Thus every nation received in
its turn some of the said truths, under the veil of its own local and
special symbolism; which, as time went on, developed into a more or less
philosophical cultus, a Pantheon in mythical disguise. Therefore is

legislator in historical chronology, though a very modern Sage in the
World's History, shown by Dr. Legge\* -- who calls him "emphatically *a
transmitter,* not a maker" -- as saying: "I only hand on: I cannot
create new things. I believe in the ancients and therefore I love
them."\*\* (Quoted in "Science of Religions" by Max Muller.)

The writer loves them too, and therefore believes in the ancients, and
the modern heirs to their Wisdom. And believing in both, she now
transmits that which she has received and learnt herself to all those
who will accept it. As to those who may reject her testimony, -- *i.e.*,
the great majority -- she will bear them no malice, for they will be as
right in their way in denying, as she is right in hers in affirming,
since they look at **TRUTH** from two entirely different stand-points.
Agreeably with the rules of critical scholarship, the Orientalist has to
reject *a priori* whatever evidence he cannot fully verify for himself.
And how can a Western scholar accept on hearsay that which he knows
nothing about? Indeed, that which is given in these volumes is selected
from *oral,* as much as from written teachings. This first instalment of
the esoteric doctrines is based upon Stanzas, which are the records of a
people unknown to ethnology; it is claimed that they are written in a
tongue absent from the nomenclature of languages and dialects with which
philology is acquainted; they are said to emanate from a source
(Occultism) repudiated by science; and, finally, they are offered
through an agency, incessantly discredited before the world by all those
who hate unwelcome truths, or have some special hobby of their own to
defend. Therefore, the rejection of these teachings may be expected, and
must be accepted beforehand. No one styling himself a "scholar," in
whatever department of exact science, will be permitted to regard these
teachings seriously. They will be derided and rejected *a priori* in
this century; but only in this one. For in the twentieth century of our
era scholars will begin to recognize that the *Secret Doctrine* has
neither been invented nor exaggerated, but, on the contrary, simply
outlined; and finally, that its teachings antedate the Vedas.\*\*\* Have
not the latter been derided, rejected, and

called "a modern forgery" even so recently as fifty years ago? Was not
Sanskrit proclaimed at one time the progeny of, and a dialect derived
from, the Greek, according to Lempriere and other scholars? About 1820,
Prof. Max Muller tells us, the sacred books of the Brahmans, of the
Magians, and of the Buddhists, "were all but unknown, their very
existence was doubted, and there was not a single scholar who could have
translated a line of the Veda . . . of the Zend Avesta, or . . . of the
Buddhist Tripitaka, and now the Vedas are proved to be the work of the
highest antiquity whose 'preservation amounts almost to a marvel'
(Lecture on the Vedas).

The same will be said of the Secret Archaic Doctrine, when proofs are
given of its undeniable existence and records. But it will take
centuries before much more is given from it. Speaking of the keys to the
Zodiacal mysteries as being almost lost to the world, it was remarked by
the writer in "Isis Unveiled" some ten years ago that: "The said key
must be turned *seven* times before the whole system is divulged. We
will give it but *one* turn, and thereby allow the profane one glimpse
into the mystery. Happy he, who understands the whole!"

The same may be said of the whole Esoteric system. One turn of the key,
and no more, was given in "Isis." Much more is explained in these
volumes. In those days the writer hardly knew the language in which the
work was written, and the disclosure of many things, freely spoken about
now, was forbidden. In Century the Twentieth some disciple more
informed, and far better fitted, may be sent by the Masters of Wisdom to
give final and irrefutable proofs that there exists a Science called
*Gupta-Vidya;* and that, like the once-mysterious sources of the Nile,
the source of all religions and philosophies now known to the world has
been for many ages forgotten and lost to men, but is at last found.

Such a work as this has to be introduced with no simple *Preface,* but
with a volume rather; one that would give *facts,* not mere
disquisitions, since the **S**ECRET **D**OCTRINE is not a treatise, or a
series of vague theories, but contains all that can be given out to the
world in this century.

portions of the esoteric teachings that have now escaped from
confinement, unless the genuineness and authenticity -- at any rate, the
*probability* -- of the existence of such teachings was first
established. Such statements as will now be made, have to be shown
warranted by various authorities: those of ancient philosophers,
classics and even certain learned Church Fathers, some of whom knew
these doctrines because they had studied them, had seen and read works
written upon them; and some of whom had even been personally initiated
into the ancient Mysteries, during the performance of which the arcane
doctrines were allegorically enacted. The writer will have to give
historical and trustworthy names, and to cite well-known authors,
ancient and modern, of recognized ability, good judgment, and
truthfulness, as also to name some of the famous proficients in the
secret arts and science, along with the mysteries of the latter, as they
are divulged, or, rather, *partially* presented before the public in
their strange archaic form.

How is this to be done? What is the best way for achieving such an
object? was the ever-recurring question. To make our plan clearer, an
illustration may be attempted. When a tourist coming from a
well-explored country, suddenly reaches the borderland of a *terra
incognita,* hedged in, and shut out from view by a formidable barrier of
impassable rocks, he may still refuse to acknowledge himself baffled in
his exploratory plans. Ingress beyond is forbidden. But, if he cannot
visit the mysterious region personally, he may still find a means of
examining it from as short a distance as can be arrived at. Helped by
his knowledge of landscapes left behind him, he can get a general and
pretty correct idea of the transmural view, if he will only climb to the
loftiest summit of the altitudes in front of him. Once there, he can
gaze at it, at his leisure, comparing that which he dimly perceives with
that which he has just left below, now that he is, thanks to his
efforts, beyond the line of the mists and the cloud-capped cliffs.

Such a point of preliminary observation, for those who would like to get
a more correct understanding of the mysteries of the pre-archaic periods
given in the texts, cannot be offered to them in these two volumes. But
if the reader has patience, and would glance at the present state of
beliefs and creeds in Europe, compare and check it with what is known to
history of the ages directly preceding and

following the Christian era, then he will find all this in Volume III.
of this work.

In that volume a brief recapitulation will be made of all the principal
adepts known to history, and the downfall of the mysteries will be
described; after which began the disappearance and final and systematic
elimination from the memory of men of the real nature of initiation and
the Sacred Science. From that time its teachings became Occult, and
Magic sailed but too often under the venerable but frequently misleading
name of Hermetic philosophy. As real Occultism had been prevalent among
the Mystics during the centuries that preceded our era, so Magic, or
rather Sorcery, with its Occult Arts, followed the beginning of
Christianity.

However great and zealous the fanatical efforts, during those early
centuries, to obliterate every trace of the mental and intellectual
labour of the Pagans, it was a failure; but the same spirit of the dark
demon of bigotry and intolerance has perverted systematically and ever
since, every bright page written in the pre-Christian periods. Even in
her uncertain records, history has preserved enough of that which has
survived to throw an impartial light upon the whole. Let, then, the
reader tarry a little while with the writer, on the spot of observation
selected. He is asked to give all his attention to that millennium which
divided the pre-Christian and the *post*-Christian periods, by the year
**O**NE of the Nativity. This event -- whether historically correct or
not -- has nevertheless been made to serve as a first signal for the
erection of manifold bulwarks against any possible return of, or even a
glimpse into, the hated religions of the Past; hated and *dreaded --*
because throwing such a vivid light on the new and intentionally veiled
interpretation of what is now known as the "New Dispensation."

However superhuman the efforts of the early Christian fathers to
obliterate the Secret Doctrine from the very memory of man, they all
failed. Truth can never be killed; hence the failure to sweep away
entirely from the face of the earth every vestige of that ancient
Wisdom, and to shackle and gag every witness who testified to it. Let
one only think of the thousands, and perhaps millions, of **MSS**.

mountain, valleys and highlands, seeking for and eager to destroy every
obelisk and pillar, scroll or parchment they could lay their hands on,
if it only bore the symbol of the *tau,* or any other sign borrowed and
appropriated by the new faith; and he will then see plainly how it is
that so little has remained of the records of the Past. Verily, the
fiendish spirits of fanaticism, of early and mediaeval Christianity and
of Islam, have from the first loved to dwell in darkness and ignorance;
and both have made

Both creeds have won their proselytes at the point of the sword; both
have built their churches on *heaven-kissing hecatombs of human
victims.* Over the gateway of Century I. of our era, the ominous words
"the **K**ARMA OF **I**SRAEL," fatally glowed. Over the portals of our
own, the future seer may discern other words, that will point to the
Karma for cunningly made-up **H**ISTORY, for events purposely perverted,

recognition, between the two cars of Jagannatha -- Bigotry and

To this, Professor Max Muller replies: "The sins of Islam are *as
worthless as the dust of Christianity. On the day of resurrection both
Muhammadans and Christians will see the vanity of their religious
doctrines.* Men fight about religion on earth -- in heaven they shall
find out that there is only one true religion -- the worship of God's
**S**PIRIT."\*

In other words -- "**T**HERE IS NO RELIGION (OR LAW) HIGHER THAN TRUTH"
-- "**SATYAT NASTI PARO DHARMAH**" -- the motto of the Maharajah of
Benares, adopted by the Theosophical Society.

As already said in the *Preface,* the Secret Doctrine is not a version
of "Isis Unveiled" -- as originally intended. It is a volume explanatory
of

it rather, and, though entirely independent of the earlier work, an
indispensable corollary to it. Much of what was in Isis could hardly be
understood by theosophists in those days. The Secret Doctrine will now
throw light on many a problem left unsolved in the first work,
especially on the opening pages, which have never been understood.

Concerned simply with the philosophies within our historical times and
the respective symbolism of the fallen nations, only a hurried glance
could be thrown at the panorama of Occultism in the two volumes of Isis.
In the present work, detailed Cosmogony and the evolution of the four
races that preceded our Fifth race Humanity are given, and now two large
volumes explain that which was stated on the first page of **I**SIS
**U**NVEILED alone, and in a few allusions scattered hither and thither
throughout that work. Nor could the vast catalogue of the Archaic
Sciences be attempted in the present volumes, before we have disposed of
such tremendous problems as Cosmic and Planetary Evolution, and the
gradual development of the mysterious Humanities and races that preceded
our "Adamic" Humanity. Therefore, the present attempt to elucidate some
mysteries of the Esoteric philosophy has, in truth, nothing to do with
the earlier work. As an instance, the writer must be allowed to
illustrate what is said.

Volume I. of "Isis" begins with a reference to "an old book" --

> "So very old that our modern antiquarians might ponder over its pages
> an indefinite time, and still not quite agree as to the nature of the
> fabric upon which it is written. It is the only original copy now in

The "very old Book" is the original work from which the many volumes of
*Kiu-ti* were compiled. Not only this latter and the *Siphrah Dzeniouta*
but even the *Sepher Jezirah,\** the work attributed by the Hebrew
Kabalists to their Patriarch Abraham (!), the book of *Shu-king,*
China's primitive Bible, the sacred volumes of the Egyptian
Thoth-Hermes, the Puranas in India, and the Chaldean *Book of Numbers*
and the *Pentateuch* itself, are all derived from that one small parent
volume. Tradition says, that it was taken down in *Senzar,* the secret
sacerdotal tongue, from the words of the Divine Beings, who dictated it
to the sons of Light, in Central Asia, at the very beginning of the 5th
(our) race; for there was a time when its language (the *Sen-zar*) was
known to the Initiates of every nation, when the forefathers of the
Toltec understood it as easily as the inhabitants of the lost Atlantis,
who inherited it, in their turn, from the sages of the 3rd Race, the
*Manushis,* who learnt it direct from the *Devas* of the 2nd and 1st
Races. The "illustration" spoken of in "Isis" relates to the evolution
of these Races and of our 4th and 5th Race Humanity in the Vaivasvata
Manvantara or "Round"; each Round being composed of the Yugas of the
seven periods of Humanity; four of which are now passed in *our* life
cycle, the middle point of the 5th being nearly reached. The
illustration is symbolical, as every one can well understand, and covers
the ground from the beginning. The old book, having described Cosmic
Evolution and explained the origin of everything on earth, including
physical man, after giving the true history of the races from the
*First* down to the Fifth (our) race, goes no further. It stops short at
the beginning of the *Kali Yuga* just 4989 years ago at the death of
Krishna, the bright "Sun-god," the once living hero and reformer.

But there exists another book. None of its possessors regard it as very
ancient, as it was born with, and is only as old as the Black Age,

declared that he had performed "miracles" by means of the *Book of

Oshoi. (See "*Jerusalem Talmud, Sanhedrin,"* c. 7, etc.; and "*Franck,*"
*pp.* 55, 56.) Many of the Mediaeval Occultists, Alchemists, and
Kabalists claimed the same; and even the late modern *Magus,* Eliphas
Levi, publicly asserts it in print in his books on Magic.

namely, about 5,000 years. In about nine years hence, the first cycle of
the first five millenniums, that began with the great cycle of the
Kali-Yuga, will end. And then the last prophecy contained in that book
(the first volume of the prophetic record for the Black Age) will be
accomplished. We have not long to wait, and many of us will witness the
Dawn of the New Cycle, at the end of which not a few accounts will be
settled and squared between the races. Volume II. of the Prophecies is
nearly ready, having been in preparation since the time of Buddha's
grand successor, Sankaracharya.

One more important point must be noticed, one that stands foremost in
the series of proofs given of the existence of one primeval, universal
Wisdom -- at any rate for the Christian Kabalists and students. The
teachings were, at least, partially known to several of the Fathers of
the Church. It is maintained, on purely historical grounds, that Origen,
Synesius, and even Clemens Alexandrinus, had been themselves initiated
into the mysteries before adding to the Neo-Platonism of the Alexandrian
school, that of the Gnostics, under the Christian veil. More than this,
some of the doctrines of the Secret schools -- though by no means all --
were preserved in the Vatican, and have since become part and parcel of
the mysteries, in the shape of disfigured additions made to the original
Christian programme by the Latin Church. Such is the now materialised
dogma of the Immaculate Conception. This accounts for the great
persecutions set on foot by the Roman Catholic Church against Occultism,
Masonry, and *heterodox* mysticism generally.

The days of Constantine were the last turning-point in history, the
period of the Supreme struggle that ended in the Western world
throttling the old religions in favour of the new one, built on their
bodies. From thence the vista into the far distant Past, beyond the
"Deluge" and the Garden of Eden, began to be forcibly and relentlessly
closed by every fair and unfair means against the indiscreet gaze of
posterity. Every issue was blocked up, every record that hands could be
laid upon, destroyed. Yet there remains enough, even among such
mutilated records, to warrant us in saying that there is in them every
possible evidence of the actual existence of a Parent Doctrine.
Fragments have survived geological and political cataclysms to tell the
story; and every survival shows evidence that the now *Secret* Wisdom
was once the

one fountain head, the ever-flowing perennial source, at which were fed
all its streamlets -- the later religions of all nations -- from the
first down to the last. This period, beginning with Buddha and
Pythagoras at the one end and the Neo-Platonists and Gnostics at the
other, is the only focus left in History wherein converge for the last
time the bright rays of light streaming from the aeons of time gone by,
unobscured by the hand of bigotry and fanaticism.

This accounts for the necessity under which the writer has laboured to
be ever explaining the facts given from the hoariest Past by evidence
gathered from the historical period. No other means was at hand, at the
risk even of being once more charged with a lack of method and system.
The public must be made acquainted with the efforts of many
World-adepts, of initiated poets, writers, and classics of every age, to
preserve in the records of Humanity the Knowledge of the existence, at
least, of such a philosophy, if not actually of its tenets. The
Initiates of 1888 would indeed remain incomprehensible and ever a
seemingly impossible myth, were not like Initiates shown to have lived
in every other age of history. This could be done only by naming Chapter
and Verse where may be found mention of these great characters, who were
preceded and followed by a long and interminable line of other famous
Antediluvian and Post-diluvian Masters in the arts. Thus only could be
shown, on semi-traditional and semi-historical authority, that knowledge
of the Occult and the powers it confers on man, are not altogether
fictions, but that they are as old as the world itself.

To my judges, past and future, therefore -- whether they are serious
literary critics, or those howling dervishes in literature who judge a
book according to the popularity or unpopularity of the author's name,
who, hardly glancing at its contents, fasten like lethal *bacilli* on
the weakest points of the body -- I have nothing to say. Nor shall I
condescend to notice those crack-brained slanderers -- fortunately very
few in number -- who, hoping to attract public attention by throwing
discredit on every writer whose name is better known than their own,
foam and bark at their very shadows. These, having first maintained for
years that the doctrines taught in the *Theosophist,* and which
culminated in "Esoteric Buddhism," *had been all invented by the present
writer*, have finally turned round, and denounced "Isis Unveiled" and
the rest as a plagiarism from Eliphas Levi (!), Paracelsus (!!), and,

*dictu,* Buddhism and Brahmanism (!!!) As well charge Renan with having
stolen his *Vie de Jesus* from the Gospels, and Max Muller his "Sacred
Books of the East" or his "Chips" from the philosophies of the Brahmins
and Gautama, the Buddha. But to the public in general and the readers of
the "Secret Doctrine" I may repeat what I have stated all along, and
which I now clothe in the words of Montaigne: Gentlemen, "**I** HAVE
HERE MADE ONLY A NOSEGAY OF CULLED FLOWERS, AND HAVE BROUGHT NOTHING OF
MY OWN BUT THE STRING THAT TIES THEM."

Pull the "string" to pieces and cut it up in shreds, if you will. As for
the nosegay of FACTS -- you will never be able to make away with these.
You can only ignore them, and no more.

We may close with a parting word concerning this Volume I. In an
**I**NTRODUCTION prefacing a Part dealing chiefly with Cosmogony,
certain subjects brought forward might be deemed out of place, but one
more consideration added to those already given have led me to touch
upon them. Every reader will inevitably judge the statements made from
the stand-point of his own knowledge, experience, and consciousness,
based on what he has already learnt. This fact the writer is constantly
obliged to bear in mind: hence, also the frequent references in this
first Book to matters which, properly speaking, belong to a later part
of the work, but which could not be passed by in silence, lest the
reader should look down on this work as a fairy tale indeed -- a fiction
of some modern brain.

Thus, the *Past* shall help to realise the **P**RESENT, and the latter
to better appreciate the **P**AST. The errors of the day must be
explained and swept away, yet it is more than probable -- and in the
present case it amounts to certitude -- that once more the testimony of
long ages and of history will fail to impress anyone but the very
intuitional -- which is equal to saying the very few. But in this as in
all like cases, the *true* and the *faithful* may console themselves by
presenting the sceptical modern Sadducee with the mathematical proof and
memorial of his obdurate obstinacy and bigotry. There still exists
somewhere in the archives of the French Academy, the famous law of
probabilities worked out by an algebraical process for the benefit of
sceptics by certain mathematicians. It runs thus: If two persons give
their evidence to

------------------------------------------------------------------------

###### \[\[Vol. 1, Page\]\] xlvii INTRODUCTORY.

a fact, and thus impart to it each of them 5/6 of certitude; that fact
will have then 35/36 of certitude; *i.e.*, its probability will bear to
its improbability the ratio of 35 to 1. If three such evidences are
joined together the certitude will become 215/216. The agreement of ten
persons giving each 1/2 of certitude will produce 1023/1024 , etc., etc.
The Occultist may remain satisfied, and care for no more.
