#### ENOICHION-HENOCH.

**T**HE history of the evolution of the Satanic myth would not be
complete if we omitted to notice the character of the mysterious and
Cosmopolitan Enoch, variously called Enos, Hanoch, and finally Enoichion
by the Greeks. It is from his Book that the first notions of the Fallen
Angels were taken by the early Christian writers.

The "Book of Enoch" is declared apocryphal. But what is an *Apocrypha?*
The very etymology of the term shows that it is simply a *secret* book*,
i.e.*, one that belonged to the catalogue of temple libraries under the
guardianship of the Hierophants and initiated priests, and was never
meant for the profane. *Apocrypha* comes from the verb *Crypto,
\[\[krupto\]\], "to hide."* For ages the *Enoichion* (the Book of the
**S**EER) was preserved in the "city of letters" and secret works -- the
ancient Kirjath-Sepher, later on, Debir (see *Joshua* xv*.,* 15).

Some of the writers interested in the subject -- especially Masons --
have tried to identify Enoch with Thoth of Memphis, the Greek Hermes,
and even with the Latin Mercury. As individuals, all these are distinct
one from the other; professionally -- if one may use this word, now so
limited in its sense -- they belong one and all to the same category of
sacred writers, of Initiators and Recorders of Occult and ancient
Wisdom. Those who in the *Kuran* (see Surat **XIX.**) are generically
termed the *Edris,* or the "Learned" (the Initiated), bore in Egypt the
name of "Thoth," the inventor of arts, sciences, *writing* or letters,
of music and astronomy. Among the Jews the *Edris* became "Enoch," who,
according to Bar-Hebraeus, "was the first inventor of writing," books,
arts, and sciences, the first who reduced to a system the progress of
the planets. In Greece he was called Orpheus, and thus changed his name
with every nation. The number Seven being attached to, and connected
with, each of those primitive Initiators,\* as well as the number 365,
of the days in the year, astronomically, it identifies the mission,
character, and the sacred office of all those men, but certainly not
their personalities. Enoch is the *seventh* Patriarch; Orpheus is the
possessor of the *phorminx,* the 7-stringed lyre, which is the
seven-fold mystery of initiation. Thoth, with the seven-rayed Solar
Discus on his head, travels in the Solar boat, the 365 degrees, jumping
out every fourth (leap) year for one day. Finally, Thoth-Lunus is the
septenary

well as the "Son of Man," *Enos* (*vide Genesis* iv., 26), esoterically.

god of the seven days, or the week. Esoterically and spiritually,
*Enoichion* means the "Seer of the Open Eye."

The story about Enoch, told by Josephus, namely, that he had concealed
under the pillars of Mercury or Seth his precious rolls or books, is the
same as that told of Hermes, "the father of Wisdom," who concealed his
books of Wisdom under a pillar, and then, finding the two pillars of
stone, found the science written thereon. Yet Josephus, notwithstanding
his constant efforts in the direction of Israel's unmerited
glorification, and though he does attribute that science (of Wisdom) to
the *Jewish* Enoch *--* writes *history.* He shows those pillars as
still existing during his own time. He tells us that they were built by
Seth; and so they may have been, only neither by the Patriarch of that
name, the fabled son of Adam, nor by the Egyptian god of Wisdom -- Teth,
Set, Thoth, Tat, Sat (the later *Sat-an*)*,* or Hermes, who are all one,
-- but by the "sons of the Serpent-god," or "Sons of the Dragon," the
name under which the Hierophants of Egypt and Babylon were known before
the Deluge, as were their forefathers, the Atlanteans.

What Josephus tells us, therefore, must be *allegorically* true, with
the exception of the application made of it. According to his version
the two famous pillars were entirely covered with hieroglyphics, which,
after the discovery, were copied and reproduced in the most secret
corners of the inner temples of Egypt, and have thus become the source
of its Wisdom and exceptional learning. These two "pillars," however,
are the prototypes of the two "tables of stones" hewn by Moses at the
command of the "Lord." Hence, in saying that all the great adepts and
mystics of antiquity -- like Orpheus, Hesiod, Pythagoras and Plato --
got the elements of their theology from those hieroglyphics, he is right
in one sense, and wrong in another; for he errs in accuracy. The Secret
Doctrine teaches us that the arts, sciences, theology, and especially
the philosophy of every nation which preceded the last *universally
known,* but not universal Deluge, had been recorded ideographically from
the primitive oral records of the Fourth Race, and that these were the
inheritance of the latter from the early Third Root-Race before the
allegorical Fall. Hence, also, the Egyptian pillars, the tablets, and
even the "white Oriental porphyry stone" of the Masonic legend -- which
Enoch, fearing that the real and precious secrets would be lost,
concealed before the Deluge in the bowels of the Earth -- were simply
the more or less symbolical and allegorical copies from the primitive
Records. The "Book of Enoch" is one of such copies and is a Chaldean,
now very incomplete compendium. As already said, *Enoichion* means in
Greek the "inner eye," or the Seer; in Hebrew, and with the *help of
Masoretic* points it means the initiator and instructor,

that of several other prophets, Jewish and heathen, with changes of
made-up details, the root-form being the same. Elijah is also taken up
into Heaven *alive*; and the astrologer, at the court of Isdubar, the
Chaldean *Hea*-bani, is likewise raised to heaven by the god Hea, who
was *his* patron, as Jehovah was of Elijah (whose name means in Hebrew
"God-Jah," Jehovah, ![](sd2-531.gif)), and again of *Elihu,* which has
the same meaning. This kind of easy death, or *euthanasia,* has an
esoteric meaning. It symbolises the death of any adept who has reached
the power and degree, as also the purification, which enable him to die
only in the physical body and *still live and lead a conscious life* in
his astral body. The variations on this theme are endless, but the
secret meaning is ever the same. The Pauline expression (Hebrews xi. 5)
"that he should not see death" -- *ut non videret mortem --* has thus an
esoteric meaning, but nothing *supernatural* in it. The mangled
interpretation given of some Biblical hints to the effect that Enoch,
"whose years will equal those of the world," (of the *Solar* year*,* 365
days,) will share with Christ and the prophet Elijah the honours and
bliss of the last advent and of the destruction of Antichrist --
signify, *esoterically,* that some of the great adepts will return in
the Seventh Race, when all Error will be made away with, and the advent
of **T**RUTH will be heralded by those *Sishta,* the holy "Sons of
Light."

The Latin church is not always logical, nor prudent either. She declares
the "Book of Enoch" an apocrypha, and has gone so far as to claim,
through Cardinal Cajetan and other luminaries of the Church, the
rejection from the Canon of even the Book of Jude, who, though an
*inspired* apostle, quotes from and thus sanctifies the Book of Enoch,
which is alleged to be an apocryphal work. Fortunately, some of the
dogmatics perceived the peril in time. Had they accepted Cajetan's
resolution, they would have been forced to reject likewise the fourth
Gospel; as St. John borrows literally from Enoch, and places in the
mouth of Jesus, *a whole sentence!* (*Vide supra,* ยง **XVIII**.,
sub-sect. A, about the sheep and the robbers.)

Ludolph, the "father of Ethiopic literature," commissioned to
investigate the various Enochian **MSS**. presented by Pereisc, the
traveller, to the Mazarine Library, declared that "no book of Enoch
could exist among the Abyssinians"! Further researches and discoveries
worsted his too dogmatic assertion, as all know. Bruce and Ruppel found
and brought that same work from Abyssinia some years later, and Bishop
Laurence translated it. But Bruce despised it, and scoffed at its
contents; as did all the rest of the Scientists. He declared it "a
*Gnostic* work," in which "the age of giants who devour " men -- is
given . . . hence it is another *"Apocalypsis."* Giants! another
*fairy-tale.*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

\[\[Vol. 2, Page\]\] 532 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.

Such, however, was not the opinion of all the best critics. Dr.
Hanneberg places the Book of Enoch along with the Third Book of the
Maccabees, *at the head of the list of those whose authority stands the*
*nearest to that of the canonical works.*

Verily, "where doctors disagree . . ."

As usual, however, they were all right and all wrong. To accept Enoch as
a Biblical character, a single living man, is like accepting Adam as the
first one. Enoch was a generic title, applied to, and borne by, scores
of individuals, at all times and ages, and in every race and nation.
This may be easily inferred from the fact that the ancient Talmudists
and the teachers of Midrashim are not agreed generally in their views
about Hanokh, the Son of Yered. . . . Some say Enoch was a great Saint,
beloved by God, and *taken alive to heaven* (*i.e.,* one who reached
*Mukti* or *Nirvana,* on earth, as Buddha did and others still do); and
others maintain that he was a sorcerer, a wicked magician. This shows
only that Enoch, or its equivalent, was a term, even during the days of
the later Talmudists, which meant "Seer," "Adept in the *Secret
Wisdom*," etc., without any specification as to the character of the
title-bearer. When Josephus, speaking of Elijah and Enoch (Antiquities,
ix., 2), remarks that "it is written in the sacred books they (Elijah
and Enoch) disappeared, but so that nobody knew that they died," it
means simply that *they had died in their personalities,* as Yogis die
to this day in India, or even some Christian monks to the world. They
disappear from the sight of men and die -- on the terrestrial plane --
even for themselves. A seemingly figurative way of speaking, yet
*literally true.*

"Hanokh transmitted the science of (astronomical) calculation and of
computing the seasons to Noah," says the Midrash *Pirkah* R. Eliezar
(cap. viii.), referring to Henoch that which others did to Hermes
Trismegistus, because the two are identical in their esoteric meaning.
"Hanokh" in this case, and his "Wisdom," belong to the cycle of the
Fourth Atlantean Race,\* and Noah to that of the Fifth.\*\* In this case
both represent the Root-Races, the present one and the one that preceded
it. In another sense, Enoch disappeared, "he walked with God, and he was
not, for God took him," the allegory referring to the disappearance of
the Sacred and Secret knowledge from among men; for "God" (or *Java
Aleim --* the high hierophants, the heads of the colleges of initiated
priests\*\*\*) took him; in other words, the Enochs or the *Enoichions,*
the Seers and their knowledge and wisdom, became strictly

confined to the Secret Colleges of the Prophets, with the Jews, and to
the temples with the Gentiles.

Interpreted with the help of merely the symbolical key, Enoch is the
type of the dual nature of man -- spiritual and physical. Hence he
occupies the centre of the astronomical cross (given by Eliphas Levi
from a secret work), which is a six-pointed star, "the Adonai." In the
upper triangle is the Eagle; in the left lower triangle stands the lion;
in the right, the bull: while between the bull and the lion, over them
and under the eagle, is the face of Enoch or man. (*Vide* illustrated
diagram in *Isis Unveiled,* Vol. **II**., p. 452). Now the figures on
the upper triangle represent the Four Races, leaving out the first --
the *Chhayas* or Shadows -- and the "Son of Man," *Enos* or *Enoch,* is
in the centre, because he stands between the two (the Fourth and the
Fifth) Races, as he represents the Secret Wisdom of both. These are the
four animals of *Ezekiel* and of the *Revelation.* The same double
triangle which in *Isis,* Vol. **II**, (p. 453), faces the Hindu
*Adanari,* is by far the best. For there, only the three (for us)
historical races are symbolized: the third, the androgynous, by
Ada-nari; the fourth, symbolized by the strong, powerful lion; and the
fifth -- the Aryan -- by that which is its most sacred symbol to this
day, the bull (and the cow).

A man of great erudition -- a French savant -- M. de Sacy, finds several
most singular statements in the Book of Enoch, "worthy of the most
serious examination," he says. For instance, "the author (Enoch) makes
the solar year consist of 364 days, and seems to know periods of three,
of five, and of eight years, followed by *four* supplementary days,
which, in his system, appear to be those of the equinoxes and
solstices."\* . . . . To which he adds, later on, "I see but one means
to palliate them (these 'absurdities'), it is to suppose that the author
expounds some *fanciful* system which *may have existed* BEFORE THE
ORDER OF **N**ATURE HAD BEEN ALTERED AT THE PERIOD OF THE **U**NIVERSAL
**D**ELUGE."

Precisely so; and the Secret Doctrine teaches that that "order of
nature" has been thus altered, and the series of the Earth's humanities
too. For, as the angel *Uriel* tells Enoch: "Behold, I have showed thee
all things, O Enoch; and all things have I revealed to thee. Thou seest
the Sun, the Moon, and *those which conduct the stars* in Heaven, which
cause all their operations, seasons, and arrivals to return. In the
*days* *of sinners* THE YEARS SHALL BE SHORTENED . . . . the moon shall
change its laws, etc." (chap. lxxix). In those days also, years before
the great Deluge that carried away the Atlanteans and changed the face
of the whole earth -- because "the *earth* (on its axis) *became
inclined"* --

Philosophic,* p. 393.

nature, geologically, astronomically, and cosmically in general, could
not have been the same, just because the Earth *had inclined.* See chap.
1xiv. (Sect. xi.) . . . . "And Noah cried with a bitter voice 'Hear me,
hear me, hear me'; three times. And he said 'The earth labours and is
violently inclined; surely, I shall perish with it.' "

This, by the way, looks like one of those many "inconsistencies," if the
Bible is read literally. For, to say the least, this is a very strange
fear in one who had "found grace in the eyes of the Lord" and been told
to build an ark! But here we find the venerable Patriarch expressing as
much fear as if, instead of a "friend" of God, he had been one of the
Giants doomed by the wrathful deity. The earth has already *inclined,*
and the deluge of waters has become simply a question of time, and yet
Noah seems to know nothing of his intended salvation.

A decree had come indeed; the decree of nature and the Law of Evolution,
that the earth should change its race, and that the Fourth Race should
be destroyed to make room for a better one. The Manvantara had reached
its turning point of *three and a half* Rounds, and gigantic physical
Humanity had reached the acme of gross materiality. Hence the
apocalyptic verse that speaks of a commandment gone forth that they may
be destroyed, "that *their end may be"* (of the race); for they *knew*
truly "every secret of the angels, every oppressive and secret power of
the *Satans,* and every power of those who commit sorcery, as well as of
those who make molten images in the whole earth."

And now a natural question. Who could have informed the apocryphal
author of this powerful vision (to whatever age he may be assigned
before the day of Galileo) that *the Earth could occasionally* *incline
her axis?* Whence has he derived such astronomical and geological
knowledge if the Secret Wisdom, of which the ancient Rishis and
Pythagoras had drunk, is but a fancy, an invention of the later ages?
Has Enoch read prophetically perchance in Frederick Klee's work on the
Deluge (p. 79) these lines: "The position of the terrestrial globe with
reference to the Sun has evidently been, in primitive times, different
from what it is now; and this difference must have been caused by a
displacement of the axis of rotation of the Earth."?

This reminds one of that other *unscientific* statement made by the
Egyptian priests to Herodotus, namely, that the Sun has not always risen
where it arises *now,* and that in former times the ecliptic had cut the
equator at right angles.\*

There are many such "dark sayings" throughout Puranas, Bible and
Mythology; and to the occultist they divulge two facts: (*a*) that the
ancients knew as well, and better, perhaps, than the moderns

do, astronomy, geognosy and cosmography in general; and (*b*) that the
globe and its behaviour have altered more than once since the primitive
state of things. Thus, on the *blind* faith of *his* "ignorant"
religion, which taught that Phaeton, in his desire to learn the *hidden*
truth, made the Sun deviate from its usual course -- Xenophantes asserts
somewhere that, "the Sun turned toward another country"; which is a
parallel, however slightly more scientific, if as bold, of Joshua
stopping the course of the Sun altogether. Yet it may explain the
teaching of the Northern mythology (in Jeruskoven) that, before the
*actual order* of things, the Sun arose in the South, and its placing
the Frigid Zone in the East, whereas now it is in the North.

The Book of Enoch, in short, is a *resume,* a compound of the main
features of the History of the Third, Fourth and Fifth Races; a very few
prophecies from the present age of the world; a long retrospective,
introspective and prophetic summary of universal and quite *historical*
events -- geological, ethnological, astronomical, and psychic -- with a
touch of theogony out of the antediluvian records. The Book of this
mysterious personage is referred to and quoted copiously in the *Pistis*
*Sophia,* and also in the *Zohar* and its most ancient Midrashim. Origen
and Clement of Alexandria held it in the highest esteem. To say,
therefore, that it is a post-Christian forgery is to utter an absurdity
and to become guilty of an anachronism, since Origen, among others,
lived in the second century of the Christian era, yet he mentions it as
an ancient and venerable work. The secret and sacred name and its
potency are well and clearly though allegorically described in the old
volume. From the **XVIII**th to the Lth chapter, the Visions of Enoch
are all descriptive of the Mysteries of Initiation, one of which is the
Burning Valley of the "Fallen Angels."

Perhaps St. Augustine was quite right in saying that the Church rejected
the **B**OOK OF **E**NOCH out of her canon owing to its too great
antiquity, *ob nimiam antiquitatem.*\* There was no room for the events
noticed in it within the limit of the 4004 years **B.C**. assigned to
the world from its "creation"!
