GODS, MONADS, AND ATOMS.</H4>

<P>
<STRONG>S</STRONG>OME years ago we remarked* that &quot;the Esoteric
Doctrine may well be called the 'thread-doctrine,' since, like
<EM>Sutratman</EM>,<EM> </EM>in the Vedanta philosophy,** it passes
through and strings together all the ancient philosophical religious
systems, and reconciles and explains them all.&quot; We say now
it does more. It not only reconciles the various and apparently
conflicting systems, but it checks the discoveries of modern exact
science, and shows some of them to be necessarily correct, since
they are found corroborated in the ancient records. All this will,
no doubt, be regarded as terribly impertinent and disrespectful,
a veritable crime of <EM>lese</EM>-<EM>Science; </EM>nevertheless,
it is a fact.
<P>
Science is, undeniably, ultra-materialistic in our days; but it
finds, in one sense, its justification. Nature behaving <EM>in
actu </EM>ever esoterically, and being, as the Kabalists say,
<EM>in abscondito</EM>,<EM> </EM>can only be judged by the profane
through her appearance, and that appearance is always deceitful
on the physical plane. On the other hand, the naturalists refuse
to blend physics with metaphysics, the body with its informing
soul and spirit, which they prefer ignoring. This is a matter
of choice with some, while the minority strive very sensibly to
enlarge the domain of physical science by trespassing on the forbidden
grounds of metaphysics, so distasteful to some materialists. These
scientists are wise in their generation. For all their wonderful
discoveries would go for nothing, and remain for ever <EM>headless
</EM>bodies, unless they lift the veil of matter and strain their
eyes to see <EM>beyond. </EM>Now that they have studied nature
in the length, breadth, and thickness of her physical frame, it
is time to remove the skeleton to the second plane and search
within the unknown depths for the living and real entity, for
its SUB-<EM>stance </EM>--<EM> </EM>the noumenon of evanescent
matter.

<P>
It is only by acting on such lines that some of the truths, now
called &quot;exploded superstitions,&quot; will be discovered
to be facts and the relics of ancient knowledge and wisdom.
<P>
One of such &quot;degrading&quot; beliefs -- in the opinion of
the all-denying sceptic -- is found in the idea that Kosmos, besides
its objective planetary inhabitants, its humanities in other inhabited
worlds, is full of invisible, intelligent <EM>Existences. </EM>The
so-called Arch-Angels, Angels and Spirits, of the West, copies
of their prototypes, the Dhyan-Chohans, the Devas and Pitris,
of the East, are no real Beings but fictions. On this point Materialistic
Science is inexorable. To support its position, it upsets its
own axiomatic law of uniformity in the laws of nature, that of
continuity, and all the logical sequence of analogies in the evolution
of being. The masses of the profane are asked, and made, to believe
that the accumulated testimony of History, which shows even the
Atheists of old -- such as Epicurus and Democritus -- believing
in <EM>gods</EM>,<EM> </EM>was false; and that philosophers like
Socrates and Plato, asserting their existence, were mistaken enthusiasts
and fools. If we hold our opinions merely on historical grounds,
on the authority of legions of the most eminent Sages, Neo-Platonists,
Mystics of all the ages, from Pythagoras down to the eminent Scientists
and Professors of the present century, who, if they reject &quot;gods,&quot;
believe in &quot;spirits,&quot; shall we consider such authorities
as weak-minded and foolish as any Roman Catholic peasant, who
believes in and prays to his once human Saint, or the Archangel,
St. Michael? But is there no difference between the belief of
the peasant and that of the Western heirs to the Rosicrucians
and Alchemists of the Middle Ages? Is it the Van Helmonts, the
Khunraths, the Paracelsuses and Agrippas, from Roger Bacon down
to St. Germain, who were all blind enthusiasts, hysteriacs or
cheats, or is it the handful of modern sceptics -- the &quot;leaders
of thought&quot; -- who are struck with the cecity of negation?
The latter, we opine. It would be a <EM>miracle </EM>indeed, quite
an abnormal fact in the realm of probabilities and logic, were
that handful of negators to be the sole custodians of <EM>truth</EM>,<EM>
</EM>while the million-strong hosts of believers in gods, angels,
and spirits -- in Europe and America alone -- namely, Greek and
Latin Christians, Theosophists, Spiritualists, Mystics, etc.,
etc., should be no better than deluded fanatics and hallucinated
mediums, and often no higher than the victims of deceivers and
impostors! However varying in their external presentations and
dogmas, beliefs in the Hosts of invisible Intelligences of various
grades have all the same foundation. Truth and error are mixed
in all. The exact extent, depth, breadth, and length of the mysteries
of Nature are to be found only in Eastern esoteric sciences. So
vast and so profound are these that hardly a few, a very few of
the highest Initiates -- those <EM>whose very existence is known
but to a small number of</EM> <HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 612 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</H6>

<P>
<EM>Adepts </EM>-- are capable of assimilating the knowledge.
Yet it is all there, and one by one facts and processes in Nature's
workshops are permitted to find their way into the exact Sciences,
while mysterious help is given to rare individuals in unravelling
its arcana. It is at the close of great Cycles, in connection
with racial development, that such events generally take place.
We are at the very close of the cycle of 5,000 years of the present
Aryan Kaliyuga; and between this time and 1897 there will be a
large rent made in the Veil of Nature, and materialistic science
will receive a death-blow.
<P>
Without throwing any discredit upon time-honoured beliefs, in
whatever direction, we are forced to draw a marked line between
blind faith, evolved by theologies, and knowledge due to the independent
researches of long generations of adepts; between, in short, faith
and philosophy. There have been -- in all ages -- undeniably learned
and good men who, having been reared in sectarian beliefs, died
in their crystallized convictions. For Protestants, the garden
of Eden is the primeval point of departure in the drama of Humanity,
and the solemn tragedy on the summit of Calvary, the prelude to
the hoped-for Millennium. For Roman Catholics, Satan is at the
foundation of Kosmos, Christ in its centre, and Antichrist at
its apex. For both, the Hierarchy of Being begins and ends within
the narrow frames of their respective theologies: one self-created
<EM>personal </EM>God and an Empyrean ringing with the Hallelujas
of <EM>created </EM>angels; the rest, <EM>false </EM>gods, Satan
and fiends.
<P>
Theophilosophy proceeds on broader lines. From the very beginning
of AEons -- in time and space in our Round and Globe -- the Mysteries
of Nature (at any rate, those which it is lawful for our races
to know) were recorded by the pupils of those same now invisible
&quot;heavenly men,&quot; in geometrical figures and symbols.
The keys thereto passed from one generation of &quot;wise men&quot;
to the other. Some of the symbols, thus passed from the east to
the west, were brought therefrom by Pythagoras, who was not the
inventor of his famous &quot;Triangle.&quot; The latter figure,
along with the plane cube and circle, are more eloquent and scientific
descriptions of the order of the evolution of the Universe, spiritual
and psychic, as well as physical, than volumes of descriptive
Cosmogonies and revealed &quot;<EM>Geneses</EM>.&quot; The <EM>ten
points </EM>inscribed within that &quot;Pythagorean <EM>triangle</EM>&quot;<EM>
</EM>are worth all the theogonies and angelologies ever emanated
from the theological brain. For he who interprets them -- on their
very face, and in the order given -- will find in these seventeen
points (the seven Mathematical Points hidden) the uninterrupted
series of the genealogies from the first <EM>Heavenly</EM> to
<EM>terrestrial </EM>man. And, as they give the order of Beings,
so they reveal the order in which were evolved the Kosmos, our
earth, and the primordial elements by<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 613 THE MATHEMATICAL POINT.</H6>

<P>
which the latter was generated. Begotten in the invisible <EM>Depths</EM>,<EM>
</EM>and in the womb of the same &quot;Mother&quot; as its fellow-globes
-- he who will master the mysteries of our Earth, will have mastered
those of all others.
<P>
Whatever ignorance, pride or fanaticism may suggest to the contrary,
Esoteric Cosmology can be shown inseparably connected with both
philosophy and modern science. The gods of the ancients, the monads
-- from Pythagoras down to Leibnitz -- and the atoms of the present
materialistic schools (as borrowed by them from the theories of
the old Greek Atomists) are only a compound unit, or a graduated
unity like the human frame, which begins with body and ends with
spirit. In the occult sciences they can be studied separately,
but never mastered unless viewed in their mutual correlations
during their life-cycle, and as a Universal Unity during <EM>Pralayas.</EM>

<P>
La Pluche shows sincerity, but gives a poor idea of his philosophical
capacities when declaring his personal views on the Monad or the
Mathematical Point. &quot;A point,&quot; he says, &quot;is enough
to put all the schools in the world in a combustion. But what
need has man to know that point, since the creation of such a
small being is beyond his power? <EM>A fortiori</EM>,<EM> </EM>philosophy
acts against probability when, from that point which absorbs and
disconcerts all her meditations, she presumes to pass on to the
generation of the world. . . .&quot;
<P>
Philosophy, however, could never have formed its conception of
a logical, universal, and absolute Deity if it had no Mathematical
Point within the Circle to base its speculations upon. It is only
the manifested Point, lost to our senses after its pregenetic
appearance in the infinitude and <EM>incognizability </EM>of the
Circle, that made a reconciliation between philosophy and theology
possible -- on condition that the latter should abandon its crude
materialistic dogmas. And it is because it has so unwisely rejected
the Pythagorean Monad and geometrical figures, that Christian
theology has evolved its self-created human and personal God,
the monstrous Head from whence flow in two streams the dogmas
of Salvation and Damnation. This is so true that even those clergymen
who would be philosophers and who were masons, have, in their
arbitrary interpretations, fathered upon the ancient sages the
queer idea that &quot;the Monad represented (with them) <EM>the
throne </EM>of the Omnipotent Deity, placed in the centre of the
Empyrean to indicate <B>T.G.A.O.T.U</B>.&quot;* -- read &quot;the
Great Architect of the Universe.&quot; A curious explanation this,
more Masonic than strictly Pythagorean.

ever mean &quot;the exemplification of the unity of the divine
Essence&quot;; for this was exemplified by the plane of the boundless
Circle. What it really meant was the triune co-equal Nature of
the first differentiated Substance, or the <EM>con</EM>-<EM>substantiality
</EM>of the (manifested) Spirit, matter and the Universe -- their
&quot;Son,&quot; who proceeds from the Point (the real, esoteric
<STRONG>L</STRONG>OGOS) or the Pythagorean <STRONG>M</STRONG>ONAD.
For the Greek <EM>Monas </EM>signifies &quot;Unity&quot; in its
primary sense. Those unable to seize the difference between the
monad -- the Universal Unit -- and the <EM>Monads </EM>or<EM>
</EM>the manifested Unity, as also between the ever-hidden and
the revealed <STRONG>L</STRONG>OGOS or the <EM>Word</EM>,<EM>
</EM>ought never to meddle in philosophy, let alone the Esoteric
Sciences. It is needless to remind the educated reader of Kant's
<EM>Thesis </EM>to demonstrate his second <EM>Antinomy.</EM>*<EM>
</EM>Those who have read and understood it will see clearly the
line we draw between the <EM>absolutely Ideal</EM> Universe and
the invisible though manifested Kosmos. Our Gods and Monads are
not the Elements of <EM>extension </EM>itself, but only those
of the invisible reality which is the basis of the manifested
Kosmos. Neither esoteric philosophy, nor Kant, nor Leibnitz would
ever admit that extension can be composed of simple or unextended
parts. But theologian-philosophers will not grasp this. The Circle
and the Point, which latter retires into and merges with the former,
after having emanated the first three points and connected them
with lines, thus forming the first <EM>noumenal </EM>basis of
the Second Triangle in the Manifested World, have ever been an
insuperable obstacle to theological flights into dogmatic Empyreans.
On the authority of this Archaic Symbol, a male, personal god,
the <EM>Creator</EM> and <EM>Father </EM>of all, becomes a third-rate
emanation, the Sephiroth standing <EM>fourth </EM>in descent,
and on the left hand of En-Soph (see the <EM>Kabalistic Tree of
Life</EM>)<EM>. </EM>Hence, the Monad is degraded into a Vehicle
-- a &quot;throne&quot;!
<P>
The Monad -- only the emanation and reflection of the Point (Logos)
in the phenomenal World -- becomes, as the <EM>apex </EM>of the
manifested equilateral triangle, the &quot;Father.&quot; The left
side or line is the <EM>Duad</EM>,<EM> </EM>the &quot;Mother,&quot;
regarded as the evil, counteracting principle (Plutarch, <EM>De</EM>
<EM>Placitis Placitorum</EM>);<EM> </EM>the right side represents
the Son (&quot;his Mother's husband&quot; in every Cosmogony,
as one with the <EM>apex</EM>);<EM> </EM>at the basic line is
the Universal plane of productive Nature, unifying on the phenomenal
plane Father-Mother-Son, as these were unified in the <EM>apex</EM>,<EM>
</EM>in the supersensuous World.** By mystic transmutation they
became the Quaternary -- the triangle became the <STRONG>T</STRONG>ETRAKTIS.

<H6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 615 SPACE, FORCE AND MATTER.</H6>

<P>
This transcendental application of geometry to Cosmic and divine
theogony -- the Alpha and the Omega of mystical conception --
became dwarfed after Pythagoras by Aristotle. By omitting the
Point and the Circle, and taking no account of the apex, he reduced
the metaphysical value of the idea, and thus limited the doctrine
of magnitude to a simple TRIAD -- the <EM>line</EM>,<EM> </EM>the<EM>
surface</EM>,<EM> </EM>and the <EM>body. </EM>His modern heirs,
who play at Idealism, have interpreted these three geometrical
figures as Space, Force, and Matter -- &quot;the potencies of
an interacting Unity.&quot;* Materialistic Science, perceiving
but the basic line of the <EM>manifested </EM>&quot;triangle&quot;
-- the plane of matter -- translates it practically as (Father)-<STRONG>M</STRONG>ATTER,
(Mother)-<STRONG>M</STRONG>ATTER, and (Son)-<STRONG>M</STRONG>ATTER,
and theoretically as Matter, Force, and Correlation.
<P>
But to the average physicist, as remarked by a Kabalist, &quot;Space,
Force, Matter, are, what signs in algebra are to the mathematician,
merely conventional symbols;&quot; or &quot;Force as force, and
Matter as matter, are as absolutely unknowable as is the assumed
empty space in which they are held to interact.&quot; As symbols
representing abstractions, &quot;the physicist bases reasoned
hypotheses of the origin of things . . . . and sees three needs
in what he terms creation: (<EM>a</EM>) a place wherein to create;
(<EM>b</EM>) a medium by which to create; (<EM>c</EM>) a material
from which to create. And in giving a logical expression to this
hypothesis through the terms space, force, matter, he believes
he has proved the existence of that which each of these represents
<EM>as he conceives it to be</EM>.&quot;**
<P>
The physicist who regards Space merely as a representation of
our mind, or extension unrelated to things in it, which Locke
defined as capable of neither resistance nor motion; the paradoxical
materialist, who would have a <EM>void </EM>there, where he can
see no matter, would reject with the utmost contempt the proposition
that &quot;Space is a substantial though (apparently) an absolutely
unknowable living Entity.&quot; (<EM>New Aspects</EM>,<EM> </EM>p.
9.) Such is, nevertheless, the Kabalistic teaching, and it is
that of Archaic philosophy. Space is the real world, while our
world is an artificial one. It is the One Unity throughout its
infinitude: in its bottomless depths as on its illusive surface;
a surface studded with countless phenomenal Universes, systems
and mirage-like worlds. Nevertheless, to the Eastern Occultist,
who is an objective Idealist at the bottom, in the <EM>real</EM>
world, which is a Unity of Forces, there is &quot;a connection
of all matter in the <EM>plenum</EM>,&quot;<EM> </EM>as Leibnitz
would say. This is symbolized in the Pythagorean Triangle.

It consists of <EM>ten points </EM>inscribed pyramid-like (from
one to the last four) within its three lines, and it symbolizes
the Universe in the famous Pythagorean Decad. The upper single
dot is a Monad, and represents a Unit-Point, which is <EM>the</EM>
Unity from whence all proceeds, and all is of the same essence
with it. While the ten dots within the triangle represent the
phenomenal world, the three sides of the equilateral triangle
which enclose the pyramid of dots are the barriers of <EM>noumenal
</EM>Matter, or Substance, that separate it from the world of
Thought. &quot;Pythagoras considered a <EM>point </EM>to correspond
in proportion to unity; a <EM>line </EM>to 2; a <EM>superficies</EM>
to 3; a <EM>solid </EM>to 4; and he defined a point as a Monad
having position, and the beginning of all things; a line was thought
to correspond with duality, because it was produced by the first
motion from indivisible nature, and formed the junction of two
points. A superficies was compared to the number three because
it is the first of all causes that are found in figures; for a
circle, which is the principal of all round figures, comprises
a triad, in centre -- space -- circumference. But a triangle,
which is the first of all rectilineal figures, is included in
a ternary, and receives its form according to that number; and
was considered by the Pythagoreans to be the creator of all sublunary
things. The four points at the base of the Pythagorean triangle
correspond with a solid or cube, which combines the principles
of length, breadth, and thickness, for no solid can have less
than four extreme boundary points.&quot; (<EM>Pythag. Triangle</EM>,<EM>
</EM>p. 19.)
<P>
It is argued that &quot;the human mind cannot conceive an indivisible
unit short of the annihilation of the idea with its subject.&quot;
This is an error, as the Pythagoreans have proved, and a number
of Seers before them, although there is a special training for
it, and although the profane mind can hardly grasp it. But there
are such things as <EM>metamathematics</EM> and <EM>metageometry.
</EM>Even mathematics pure and simple proceed from the Universal
to the particular, from the mathematical, hence <EM>indivisible
</EM>Point, to solid figures. The teaching originated in India,
and was taught in Europe by Pythagoras, who, throwing a veil over
the Circle and the Point -- which no living man can define except
as incomprehensible abstractions -- laid the origin of the differentiated
Cosmic matter in the basic or horizontal line of the Triangle.
Thus the latter became the earliest of geometrical figures. The
author of &quot;New Aspects of Life&quot; and of the Kabalistic
Mysteries -- objects to the objectivization, so to speak, of the
Pythagorean conception and use of the equilateral triangle, and
calls it a <EM>misnomer. </EM>His argument that a solid equilateral
body -- &quot;one whose base, and each of its sides, form equal
triangles -- must have four co-equal sides or surfaces, while
a triangular plane will as necessarily possess five,&quot; demonstrates
on the contrary the grandeur of the conception in all its esoteric
application to the idea of<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 617 PHANTOMS OF THE MIND.</H6>

<P>
the <EM>pregenesis</EM>,<EM> </EM>and the genesis of Kosmos. Granted,
that an ideal triangle, depicted by mathematical, imaginary lines
&quot;can have no sides at all, being simply <EM>a phantom of
the mind </EM>(if sides be imputed to which, they must be the
sides of the object it constructively represents).&quot; But in
such case most of the scientific hypotheses are no better than
&quot;phantoms of the mind&quot;; they are unverifiable, except
on inference, and have been adopted merely to answer scientific
necessities. Furthermore, the ideal triangle -- &quot;as the abstract
idea of a triangular body, and, therefore, as the type of an abstract
idea&quot; -- accomplished and carried out to perfection the double
symbolism intended. As an emblem applicable to the objective idea,
the simple triangle became a solid. When repeated in stone on
the four cardinal points, it assumed the shape of the Pyramid
-- the symbol of the phenomenal merging into the noumenal Universe
of thought -- at the apex of the four triangles; and, as an &quot;imaginary
figure constructed of three mathematical lines,&quot; it symbolized
the subjective spheres -- those lines &quot;enclosing a mathematical
space -- which is equal to nothing enclosing nothing.&quot; Because,
to the senses and the untrained consciousness of profane and scientist,
everything beyond the line of differentiated matter -- <EM>i.e.</EM>,
outside of, and beyond the realm of even the most spiritual <EM>substance</EM>
-- has<EM> </EM>to<EM> </EM>remain for ever <EM>equal to nothing.
</EM>It is the <STRONG>A</STRONG>IN-<STRONG>S</STRONG>OPH -- the
<EM>No</EM>-THING.
<P>
Yet these &quot;phantoms of the mind&quot; are in truth no greater
abstractions than the abstract ideas in general upon evolution
and physical development -- <EM>e.g</EM>., Gravity, Matter, Force,
etc. -- on which the exact sciences are based. Our most eminent
chemists and physicists are earnestly pursuing the not hopeless
attempt of finally tracing to its hiding-place the <EM>protyle</EM>,<EM>
</EM>or the basic line of the Pythagorean triangle. The latter
is, as said, the grandest conception imaginable, as it symbolizes
both the ideal and the visible universes.* For if &quot;<EM>the
possible unit is only a possibility as an actuality of nature</EM>,<EM>
as an individual of any kind</EM>,&quot;<EM> </EM>and as every
individual natural object is capable of division, and by division
loses its unity, <EM>or ceases to be a unit</EM>,**<EM> </EM>it
is so only in the realm of exact sciences in a world as deceptive
as it is illusive. In the realm of the Esoteric sciences the unit
divided <EM>ad infinitum</EM>,<EM> </EM>instead of losing its
unity, approaches with every division the planes of the only eternal
<STRONG>R</STRONG>EALITY. The eye of the <STRONG>S</STRONG>EER
can follow and behold it in all its pregenetic glory. This same
idea of the reality of the subjective, and the unreality of the
objective universes, is found at the bottom of the Pythagorean
and Platonic teachings -- limited to the <EM>Elect </EM>alone;

Porphyry, speaking of the <EM>Monad </EM>and the <EM>Duad</EM>,<EM>
</EM>says that the former only was considered substantial and
real, &quot;<EM>that most simple Being</EM>,<EM> the cause of
all unity and the measure of all things.</EM>&quot;
<P>
But the Duad, although the origin of Evil, or Matter -- thence
<EM>unreal </EM>in philosophy -- is still Substance during Manvantara,
and is often called the<EM> third </EM>monad, in Occultism, and
the connecting line as between two Points, . . . or Numbers which
proceeded from THAT, &quot;which was before all Numbers,&quot;
as expressed by Rabbi Barahiel. And from this Duad proceeded all
the <EM>Scintillas </EM>of the three upper and the four lower
worlds or planes -- which are in constant interaction and correspondence.
This is a teaching which the Kabala has in common with Eastern
Occultism. For in the occult philosophy there are the &quot;<STRONG>O</STRONG>NE
Cause&quot; and the &quot;<EM>Primal </EM>Cause,&quot; which latter
thus becomes, paradoxically, the second, as clearly expressed
by the author of the &quot;<EM>Qabbalah</EM>,<EM> from the philosophical
writings of Ibn Gabirol</EM>,&quot;<EM> </EM>--<EM> </EM>&quot;in
the treatment of the Primal cause, two things must be considered,
the Primal Cause <EM>per se</EM>,<EM> </EM>and the relation and
connection of the Primal Cause with the visible and unseen universe.&quot;
Thus he shows the early Hebrews following in the steps of the
Oriental philosophy -- Chaldean, Persian, Hindu, Arabic, etc.
Their Primal Cause was designated at first &quot;by the triadic
Shaddai, the (triune) Almighty, subsequently by the Tetragrammaton,
<B>YHVH</B>, symbol of the Past, Present, and Future,&quot; and,
let us add, of the eternal <STRONG>I</STRONG>S, or the <STRONG>I</STRONG>
<STRONG>A</STRONG>M. Moreover, in the Kabala the name <B>YHVH</B>
(or Jehovah) expresses a He and a She, male and female, two in
one, or Hokhmah and Binah, and his, or rather their <EM>Shekinah
</EM>or synthesizing spirit (grace), which makes again of the
Duad a Triad. This is demonstrated in the Jewish Liturgy for Pentecost,
and the prayer, &quot;In the name of Unity, of the Holy and Blessed
Hu (He), and His Shekinah, the Hidden and Concealed Hu, blessed
be <B>YHVH </B>(the Quaternary) for ever.&quot; &quot;Ha is said
to be masculine and <B>YAH</B> feminine, together they make the
<IMG SRC="sd1-618.gif" ALIGN="MIDDLE"> <EM>i.e.</EM>,<EM> </EM>one
<B>YHVH</B>. One, but of a male-female nature. The Shekinah is
always considered in the Qabbalah as feminine&quot; (p. 175).
And so it is considered in the <EM>exoteric </EM>Puranas, for
Shekinah is no more than <EM>Sakti </EM>--<EM> </EM>the female
double or lining of any god, in such case. And so it was with
the early Christians whose Holy Spirit was feminine, as Sophia
was with the Gnostics. But in the transcendental Chaldean Kabala
or &quot;Book of Numbers,&quot; &quot;Shekinah&quot; is sexless,
and the purest abstraction, a State, like Nirvana, not subject
or object or anything except an absolute <STRONG>P</STRONG>RESENCE.
<P>
Thus it is only in the anthropomorphised systems (such as the
Kabala has now greatly become) that Shekinah-Sakti is feminine.
As such she becomes the <EM>Duad </EM>of Pythagoras, the two straight
lines of the symbol that can never meet, which therefore form
no geometrical figure and are<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 619 THE MONAD OF LEIBNITZ.</H6>

<P>
the symbol of matter. Out of this Duad, when united in one basic
line of the triangle on the lower plane (the upper Triangle of
the Sephirothal Tree), emerge the Elohim, or Deity in <EM>Cosmic
</EM>Nature, with the true Kabalists the <EM>lowest </EM>designation,
translated in the Bible &quot;God&quot; (see the same work and
page).* Out of these issue the <EM>Scintillas.</EM> 
<P>
The<EM> Scintillas </EM>are the &quot;Souls,&quot; and these Souls
appear in the three-fold form of Monads (units), atoms and gods
-- according to our teaching. &quot;Every atom becomes a visible
complex unit (a molecule), and once attracted into the sphere
of terrestrial activity, the Monadic Essence, passing through
the mineral, vegetable, and animal kingdoms, becomes man.&quot;
(Esot. Catechism.) Again, &quot;God, Monad, and Atom are the correspondences
of Spirit, Mind, and Body (<EM>Atma</EM>,<EM> Manas and Sthula
Sarira</EM>)<EM> </EM>in man.&quot; In their septenary aggregation
they are the &quot;Heavenly Man&quot; (see <EM>Kabala </EM>for
the latter term); thus, terrestrial man is the provisional reflection
of the Heavenly. . . . . &quot;The Monads (<EM>Jivas</EM>)<EM>
</EM>are the Souls of the Atoms, both are the fabric in which
the Chohans (Dhyanis, <EM>gods</EM>)<EM> </EM>cloth themselves
when a form is needed.&quot; (<EM>Esot. Cat.</EM>)
<P>
This relates to Cosmic and sub-planetary Monads, not to the Super-Cosmic
<EM>Monas </EM>(the Pythagorean Monad) as called, in its synthetic
character, by the Pantheistical Peripatetics. The Monads of the
present dissertation are treated from the standpoint of their
individuality, as<EM> atomic Souls</EM>,<EM> </EM>before these
atoms descend into pure terrestrial form. For this descent into
<EM>concrete </EM>matter marks the medial point of their own individual
pilgrimage. Here, losing in the mineral kingdom their individuality,
they begin to ascend through the seven states of terrestrial evolution
to that point where a correspondence is firmly established between
the human and <EM>Deva</EM> (divine) consciousness. At present,
however, we are not concerned with their terrestrial metamorphoses
and tribulations, but with their life and behaviour in Space,
on planes wherein the eye of the most intuitional chemist and
physicist cannot reach them -- unless, indeed, he develops in
himself highly clairvoyant faculties.
<P>
It is well known that Leibnitz came several times very near the
truth, but defined monadic evolution incorrectly, which is not
to be wondered at, since he was not an <STRONG>I</STRONG>NITIATE,
nor even a Mystic, only a

* Such recent works as the Qabbalah of Mr. Isaac Myer and of Mr.

Jehovistic Deity. It is not the transcendental, philosophical,
and highly metaphysical abstraction of the original Kabalistic
thought -- Ain-Soph-Shekinah-Adam-Kadmon, and all that follows
-- that we oppose, but the crystallization of all these into the
highly unphilosophical, repulsive, and anthropomorphic Jehovah,
the androgynous and <EM>finite </EM>deity for which eternity,
omnipotence, and omniscience are claimed. We do not war against

<P>
very intuitional philosopher. Yet no psycho-physicist ever came
nearer than he has to the esoteric general outline of evolution.
This evolution -- viewed from its several standpoints -- <EM>i.e.</EM>,
as the <EM>universal </EM>and the <EM>individualized </EM>Monad;
and the chief aspects of the Evolving Energy, after differentiation
-- the purely Spiritual, the Intellectual, the Psychic and the
Physical -- may be thus formulated as an invariable law; a descent
of Spirit into Matter, equivalent to an ascent in physical evolution;
a re-ascent from the depths of materiality towards its <EM>status
quo ante</EM>,<EM> </EM>with a corresponding dissipation of concrete
form and substance up to the <STRONG>L</STRONG>AYA state, or what
Science calls &quot;the zero-point,&quot; and beyond.
<P>
These states -- once the spirit of Esoteric philosophy is grasped
-- become absolutely necessary from simple logical and analogical
considerations. Physical Science having now ascertained, through
its department of Chemistry, the invariable law of this evolution
of atoms -- from their<EM> </EM>&quot;<EM>protylean</EM>&quot;<EM>
</EM>state down to that of a physical and then a chemical particle
(or molecule) -- cannot well reject the same as a general law.
And once it is forced by its enemies -- Metaphysics and Psychology*
-- out of its alleged impregnable strongholds, it will find it
more difficult than it now appears to refuse room <EM>in the Spaces
</EM>of <STRONG>S</STRONG>PACE to Planetary Spirits (gods), Elementals,
and even the <EM>Elementary </EM>Spooks or Ghosts, and others.
Already Figuier and Paul D'Assier, two Positivists and Materialists,
have succumbed before this logical necessity. Other and still
greater Scientists will follow in that &quot;intellectual <STRONG>F</STRONG>ALL.&quot;
They will be driven out of their position not by spiritual, theosophical,
or any other physical or even mental phenomena, but simply by
the enormous <EM>gaps </EM>and<EM> chasms </EM>that open daily
and will still be opening before them, as one discovery follows
the other, until they are finally knocked off their feet by the
ninth wave of simple common sense.
<P>
Here is an example: Prof. W. Crookes' latest discovery of what
he has named <EM>protyle. </EM>In the &quot;Notes on the Bhagavat
Gita,&quot; by one of the best metaphysicians and Vedantic scholars
in India,** the lecturer, referring cautiously to &quot;things
occult&quot; in that great Indian esoteric work, makes a remark
as suggestive as it is strictly correct. &quot;. . . Into the
details of the evolution of the solar system itself,&quot; he
says, &quot;<EM>it is not necessary for me to enter. </EM>You
may gather some idea <EM>as to the way </EM>in which the various

examining the lecture delivered by Professor Crookes a short time
ago upon the so-called elements of modern chemistry. This lecture
will give you some idea of the way in which these Elements spring
from <EM>Vishwanara</EM>,*<EM> </EM>the most objective of these
three principles, which seems to stand in the place of the <EM>protyle
</EM>mentioned in that lecture. <EM>Except in a few particulars</EM>,<EM>
</EM>this lecture seems to give the outlines of the theory of
physical evolution on the plane of <EM>Vishwanara</EM>,<EM> </EM>and
is, so far as I know, <EM>the nearest approach made by modern
investigators </EM>TO THE REAL OCCULT THEORY <EM>on the subject.</EM>&quot;
<P>
These words will be re-echoed and approved by every Eastern Occultist.
Much from the lectures by Prof. Crookes has already been quoted
in &#167; <B>XII.</B> of these Addenda. Since then, there has
been another lecture delivered, as remarkable as the first one,
on the &quot;Genesis of the Elements,&quot;** and also a third
one. Here we have almost a corroboration of the teachings of Esoteric
philosophy concerning the mode of primeval evolution. It is, indeed,
as <EM>near an approach</EM>,<EM> </EM>made by a great scholar
and specialist in chemistry,*** to the Secret Doctrine, as could
be made apart from the application of the monads and atoms to
the dogmas of pure transcendental metaphysics, and their connection
and correlation with &quot;Gods and intelligent Conscious Monads.&quot;
But Chemistry is now on its ascending plane, thanks to one of
its highest European representatives. It is impossible for it
to go back to that day when materialism regarded its <EM>sub</EM>-elements
as absolutely simple and homogeneous bodies, which it had raised,
in its blindness, to the rank of elements. The mask has been snatched
off by too clever a hand for there to be any fear of a new disguise.
And after years of pseudology, of bastard molecules parading under
the name of elements, behind and beyond which there could be nought
but void, a great professor of chemistry asks once more: &quot;What
are these elements, whence do they come, what is their signification?
. . . . These elements perplex us in our researches, baffle us
in our speculations, and haunt us in our very dreams. They stretch
like an unknown sea before us mocking -- mystifying, and murmuring
strange revelations and possibilities.&quot; (<EM>Gen. of Elem.</EM>,<EM>

when his discovery of radiant matter will have resulted in a further
elucidation with regard to the true source of light, and revolutionized
all the present speculations. Further familiarity with the northern
streamers of the <EM>aurora borealis </EM>may help the recognition
of this truth.<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 622 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</H6>

<P>
Those who are heirs to primeval revelations have taught these
&quot;possibilities&quot; in every century, but have never found
a fair hearing. The truths inspired to Kepler, Leibnitz, Gassendi,
Swedenborg, etc., were ever alloyed with their own speculations
in one or another predetermined direction --hence distorted. But
now one of the great truths has dawned upon an eminent professor
of modern exact science, and he fearlessly proclaims as a fundamental
axiom that Science has not made itself acquainted, so far, with
<EM>real</EM> simple elements. For Prof. Crookes tells his audience:
<P>
&quot;If I venture to say <EM>that our commonly received elements
are</EM> NOT <EM>simple and primordial</EM>,<EM> </EM>that they
have <EM>not </EM>arisen by chance or have <EM>not </EM>been created
in a desultory and mechanical manner, but have been evolved from
simpler matters -- or perhaps, indeed, from one sole kind of matter
-- I do but give formal utterance to an idea which has been, so
to speak, for some time 'in the air' of science. Chemists, physicists,
philosophers of the highest merit, declare explicitly their belief
that the seventy (or thereabouts) elements of our text-books are
not the pillars of Hercules which we must never hope to pass.&quot;
. . . &quot;Philosophers in the present as in the past -- men
who certainly have not worked in the laboratory -- have reached
the same view from another side.&quot; Thus Mr. Herbert Spencer
records his conviction that 'the chemical atoms are produced from
the true or physical atoms by processes of evolution under conditions
which chemistry has not yet been able to produce.' . . . &quot;And
the poet has forestalled the philosopher. Milton ('Paradise Lost,'
Book V.) makes the Archangel Raphael say to Adam, instinct with
the evolutionary idea, that the Almighty had created
<BLOCKQUOTE>
. . . 'One first matter, all<BR>
Indued with various forms, various degrees<BR>
Of substance.' &quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Nevertheless, the idea would have remained crystallized &quot;in
the air of Science,&quot; and never have descended into the thick
atmosphere of materialism and profane mortals for years to come,
perhaps, had not Professor Crookes bravely and fearlessly reduced
it to its simple elements, and thus publicly forced it on Scientific
notice. &quot;An idea,&quot; says Plutarch, &quot;is a <EM>being
</EM>incorporeal, which has no subsistence by itself, but gives
figure and form unto shapeless matter, and <EM>becomes the cause
of the manifestation.</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>(<EM>De Placit. Philos.</EM>)<EM>
</EM>The revolution produced in old chemistry by Avogadro was
the first page in the Volume of <EM>New Chemistry. </EM>Mr. Crookes
has now turned the second page, and is boldly pointing <EM>to
what may be the last. </EM>For once <EM>protyle </EM>accepted
and recognized -- <EM>as invisible Ether was</EM>,<EM> both being
logical and scientific necessities </EM>--<EM> </EM>Chemistry
will have virtually ceased to live: it will reappear in its reincarnation
as <EM>New Alchemy</EM>,<EM> </EM>or <STRONG>M</STRONG>ETACHEMISTRY.
The discoverer of<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 623 THE GENESIS OF ATOMS.</H6>

<P>
radiant matter will have vindicated in time the Archaic Aryan
works on Occultism and even the Vedas and Puranas. For what are
the manifested &quot;Mother,&quot; the &quot;Father-Son-Husband&quot;
(Aditi and Daksha, a form of Brahma, as Creators) and the &quot;Son,&quot;
-- the three &quot;First-born&quot; -- <EM>but simply Hydrogen</EM>,<EM>
Oxygen</EM>,<EM> </EM>and that which in its terrestrial manifestation
is called <EM>nitrogen. </EM>Even the exoteric descriptions of
the &quot;First Born&quot; triad give all the characteristics
of these three <EM>gases. </EM>Priestley, the &quot;discoverer&quot;
of Oxygen, or that which was known in the highest antiquity!
<P>
Yet all the ancient, mediaeval, and modern poets and philosophers
have been anticipated even in the exoteric Hindu books. Descartes'
<EM>plenum </EM>of matter differentiated into particles; Leibnitz's
<EM>Ethereal Fluid </EM>and Kant's &quot;primitive fluid&quot;
dissolved into its elements; Kepler's Solar Vortex and Systemic
Vortices; in short, from the Elemental Vortices inaugurated by
the universal mind -- through Anaxagoras, down to Galileo, Torricelli,
and Swedenborg, and after them to the latest speculations by European
mystics -- all this is found in the Hindu hymns and Mantras to
the &quot;Gods, Monads, and Atoms,&quot; in their fulness, for
they are inseparable. In esoteric teachings, the most transcendental
conceptions of the universe and its mysteries, as the most (seemingly)
materialistic speculations are found reconciled, because those
sciences embrace the whole scope of evolution from Spirit to matter.
As declared by an American Theosophist, &quot;The Monads (of Leibnitz)
may from one point of view be called <EM>force</EM>,<EM> </EM>from
another <EM>matter. </EM>To occult Science, <EM>force </EM>and
<EM>matter </EM>are <EM>only two sides of the same </EM>SUBSTANCE.&quot;
(&quot;Path,&quot; No. 10, p. 297.)
<P>
Let the reader remember these &quot;Monads&quot; of Leibnitz,
every one of which is a living mirror of the universe, every monad
reflecting every other, and compare this view and definition with
certain Sanskrit stanzas (<EM>Slokas</EM>)<EM> </EM>translated
by Sir William Jones, in which it is said that the creative source
of the Divine Mind, . . . &quot;Hidden in a veil of thick darkness,
formed <EM>mirrors of the atoms </EM>of the world, and <EM>cast
reflection from its own face on every atom. . </EM>. . .&quot;
<P>
When, therefore, Professor Crookes declares that &quot;If we can
show how the so-called chemical elements might have been generated
we shall be able to fill up a formidable gap in our knowledge
of the universe, . . .&quot; the answer is ready. The theoretical
knowledge is contained in the esoteric meaning of every Hindu
cosmogony in the <EM>Puranas;</EM> the<EM> </EM>practical demonstration
thereof -- is in the hands of those who will not be recognised
<EM>in this </EM>century, save by the very few. The scientific
possibilities of various discoveries, that must inexorably lead
exact Science into the acceptation of Eastern Occult views, which
contain all the requisite material for the filling of those &quot;gaps,&quot;
are, so far, at the mercy of modern materialism. It is only by
working in the direction<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 624 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</H6>

<P>
taken by Professor Crookes that there is any hope for the recognition
of a few, hitherto Occult, truths.
<P>
Meanwhile, one thirsting to have a glimpse at a practical diagram
of the evolution of primordial matter, which, separating and differentiating
under the impulse of cyclic law, divides itself into a septenary
gradation of <STRONG>S</STRONG>UBSTANCE (from a general view),
can do no better than examine the plates attached to Mr. Crookes'
lecture: &quot;Genesis of the Elements,&quot; and ponder well
over some passages of the text. In one place (p. 11) he says:
--
<P>
&quot;. . . . Our notions of a chemical element have expanded.
Hitherto the molecule has been regarded as an aggregate of two
or more atoms, and no account has been taken of the architectural
design on which these atoms have been joined. We may consider
that the structure of a chemical element is more complicated than
has hitherto been supposed. Between the molecules we are accustomed
to deal with in chemical reactions and ultimate atoms as first
created, come smaller molecules or aggregates of physical atoms;
then sub-molecules differ one from the other, according to the
position they occupied in the yttrium edifice.&quot;
<P>
&quot;Perhaps this hypothesis can be simplified if we imagine
yttrium to be represented by a five-shilling piece. By chemical
fractionation I have divided it into five separate shillings,
and find that these shillings are not counterparts, but like the
carbon atoms in the benzol ring, have the impress of their position,
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, stamped on them. . . . If I throw my shillings
into the melting-pot or dissolve them chemically, the mint stamp
disappears and they all turn out to be silver.&quot; . . .
<P>
This will be the case with all the atoms and molecules when they
have separated from their compound forms and bodies -- when <EM>pralaya
</EM>sets in. Reverse the case, and imagine the dawn of a new
manvantara. The pure &quot;silver&quot; of the absorbed material
will once more separate into SUBSTANCE, which will generate &quot;Divine
Essences&quot; whose &quot;principles&quot;* are the primary elements,
the sub-elements, the physical energies and subjective and objective
matter; or, as these are epitomised -- GODS, MONADS, and ATOMS.
If leaving for one moment the metaphysical or transcendental side
of the question, -- dropping out of the present consideration
the supersensuous and intelligent beings and entities believed
in by the Kabalists and Christians -- we turn to the atomical
theory of evolution, the occult teachings are still found corroborated
by exact Science and its confessions, as far, at least, as regards
the supposed &quot;simple&quot; elements, now suddenly

<H6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 625 HERMES OR HUXLEY?</H6>

<P>
degraded into poor and distant relatives -- not even second cousins
to the latter. For we are told by Prof. Crookes that:
<P>
&quot;Hitherto, it has been considered that if the atomic weight
of a metal, determined by different observers, setting out from
different compounds, was always found to be constant . . . then
such metal must rightly take rank among the simple or elementary
bodies. We learn . . . that this is no longer the case. Again,
we have here wheels within wheels. Gadolinium is not an element
but a compound. . . We have shown that yttrium is a complex of
five or more new constituents. And who shall venture to gainsay
that each of these constituents, if attacked in some different
manner, and if the result were submitted to a test more delicate
and searching than the radiant-matter test, might not be still
further divisible? Where, then, is the actual ultimate element?
As we advance it recedes like the tantalizing mirage lakes and
groves seen by the tired and thirsty traveller in the desert.
Are we in our quest for truth to be thus deluded and baulked?
The very idea of an element, as something absolutely primary and
ultimate, seems to be growing less and less distinct. . .&quot;
(p. 16).
<P>
On page 429 of <EM>Isis Unveiled</EM>,<EM> </EM>Vol. I., we said
that &quot;the mystery of first creation, which was ever the despair
of Science, is unfathomable unless they (the Scientists) accept
the doctrine of Hermes. <EM>They will have to follow in the footsteps
of the Hermetists.</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>Our prophecy begins to
assert itself.
<P>
But between Hermes and Huxley there is a middle course and point.
Let the men of Science only throw a bridge half-way, and think
seriously over the theories of Leibnitz. We have shown <EM>our</EM>
theories with regard to atomic evolution -- their last formation
into compound chemical molecules being produced within our terrestrial
workshops in the earth's atmosphere and not elsewhere -- as strangely
agreeing with the evolution of atoms shown on Mr. Crookes' plates.
Several times already it was stated in this volume that <EM>Marttanda
</EM>(the Sun) had evolved and aggregated, together with his smaller
seven Brothers, from his Mother's (Aditi's) bosom, that bosom
being <EM>prima </EM>MATER-ia -- the lecturer's primordial <EM>protyle.
</EM>Esoteric doctrines teach the existence of &quot;an antecedent
form of energy having periodic cycles of ebb and swell, rest and
activity&quot; (p. 21) -- and behold a great scholar in Science
now asking the world to accept this as one of the postulates.
We have shown the &quot;Mother,&quot; fiery and hot, becoming
gradually cool and radiant, and that same Scientist claims as
his second postulate, a <EM>scientific necessity</EM>,<EM> </EM>it
would seem -- &quot;an internal action akin to cooling, operating
slowly in the protyle.&quot; Occult Science teaches that &quot;Mother&quot;
lies stretched in infinity (during <EM>Pralaya</EM>)<EM> </EM>as
the great Deep, the &quot;<EM>dry</EM> Waters of Space,&quot;
according to the quaint expression in the <EM>Catechism</EM>,<EM>
</EM>and becomes <EM>wet</EM><HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 626 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</H6>

<P>
only after the separation and the moving over its face of <EM>Narayana</EM>,<EM>
</EM>the &quot;Spirit which is invisible Flame, which never burns,
but sets on fire all that it touches, and gives it life and generation.&quot;*
And now Science tells us that &quot;the first-born element . .
. most nearly allied to protyle&quot; . . . would be &quot;<EM>hydrogen
</EM>. . . which for some time would be the only existing form
of matter&quot; in the Universe. What says <EM>Old</EM> Science?
It answers: just so; but we would call hydrogen and oxygen (which
instils the fire of life into the &quot;Mother&quot; by incubation)
in the <EM>pregenetic </EM>and even pre-geological ages -- the
<EM>Spirit</EM>,<EM> </EM>the<EM> noumenon </EM>of that which
becomes in its grossest form oxygen and hydrogen and nitrogen
on Earth -- nitrogen being of no divine origin, but merely an
earth-born cement to unite other gases and fluids, and serve as
a sponge to carry in itself the breath of LIFE -- pure air.**
Before these <EM>gases </EM>and fluids become what they are in
<EM>our</EM> atmosphere, they are interstellar Ether; still earlier
and on a <EM>deeper </EM>plane -- something else, and so on <EM>in
infinitum. </EM>The eminent and learned gentleman must pardon
an Occultist for quoting him at such length; but such is the penalty
of a Fellow of the Royal Society who approaches so near the precincts
of the Sacred Adytum of Occult mysteries as virtually to overstep
the forbidden boundaries.
<P>
But it is time to leave modern <EM>physical </EM>science and turn
to the psychological and metaphysical side of the question. We
would only remark that to the &quot;two very reasonable postulates&quot;
required by the eminent lecturer, &quot;to get a glimpse of some
few of the secrets so darkly hidden&quot; behind &quot;the door
of the Unknown&quot; -- a third should be added*** -- lest no
battering at it should avail; the postulate that Leibnitz, in
his speculations, stood on a firm groundwork of fact and truth.
The admirable and thoughtful synopsis of these speculations --
as given by John Theodore Merz in his &quot;Leibnitz&quot; --
shows how nearly he has brushed the hidden secrets of esoteric
Theogony in his <EM>Monadologie. </EM>And yet that philosopher
has hardly risen in his speculations above the first planes, the
lower principles of the Cosmic Great Body. His theory soars to
no loftier heights than those of the <EM>manifested </EM>life,
self-consciousness and intelligence, leaving the regions of the
earlier post-genetic mysteries untouched, as his ethereal fluid
is post-planetary.
<P>
But this third postulate will hardly be accepted by the modern
men
<H6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------

<P>
of Science; and, like Descartes, they will prefer keeping to the
properties of external things, which, like extension, are incapable
of explaining the phenomenon of motion, rather than accept the
latter as an independent Force. They will never become anti-Cartesian
in this generation; nor will they admit that &quot;this property
of inertia is not a purely geometrical property, that it points
to the existence of something in external bodies which is not
extension merely.&quot; This is Leibnitz's idea as analyzed by
Mertz, who adds that he called this <EM>something </EM>Force,<EM>
</EM>and maintained that external things were endowed with Force,
and that in order to be the bearers of this force they must have
a substance, for they are not lifeless and inert masses, but the
centres and bearers of form, a purely esoteric claim, since <EM>force
</EM>was with Leibnitz an <EM>active </EM>principle, the division
between mind and matter disappearing by this conclusion. But --
<P>
&quot;The mathematical and dynamical inquiries of Leibnitz would
not have led to the same result in the mind of a purely scientific
inquirer. But Leibnitz was not a scientific man in the modern
sense of the word. Had he been so, he might have worked out the
conception of energy, defined mathematically the ideas of force
and mechanical work, and arrived at the conclusion that even for
purely scientific purposes it is desirable to look upon force,
not as a primary quantity, but as a quantity derived from some
other value.&quot;
<P>
But, luckily for truth --
<P>
&quot;Leibnitz was a philosopher; and as such he had certain primary
principles, which biassed him in favour of certain conclusions,
and his discovery that external things were substances endowed
with force was at once used for the purpose of applying these
principles. One of these principles was the law of continuity,
the conviction that all the world was connected, that there were
no gaps and chasms which could not be bridged over. The contrast
of extended thinking substances was unbearable to him. The definition
of the extended substances had already become untenable: it was
natural that a similar inquiry was made into the definition of
mind, the thinking substance. . .&quot;
<P>
The divisions made by Leibnitz, however incomplete and faulty
from the standpoint of Occultism, show a spirit of metaphysical
intuition to which no man of science, not Descartes -- not even
Kant -- has ever reached. With him there existed ever an infinite
gradation of thought. Only a small portion of the contents of
our thoughts, he said, rises into the clearness of apperception,
&quot;into the light of perfect consciousness.&quot; Many remain
in a confused or obscure state, in the state of &quot;perceptions;&quot;
but they are there; . . . Descartes denied soul to the animal,
Leibnitz endowed, as the Occultists do, &quot;the whole creation
with mental life, this being, according to him, capable of infinite
gradations.&quot; And<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 628 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</H6>

<P>
this, as Mertz justly observes, &quot;at once widened the realm
of mental life, destroying the contrast of <EM>animate and inanimate
matter; </EM>it did yet more -- it reacted on the conception of
matter, of the extended substance. For it became evident that
external or material things presented the property of extension
to our senses only, not to our thinking faculties. The mathematician,
in order to calculate geometrical figures, had been obliged to
divide them into an infinite number of infinitely small parts,
and the physicist saw no limit to the divisibility of matter into
atoms. The bulk through which external things seemed to fill space
was a property which they acquired only through the coarseness
of our senses. . . . Leibnitz followed these arguments to some
extent, but he could not rest content in assuming that matter
was composed of a finite number of very small parts. His mathematical
mind forced him to carry out the argument <EM>in infinitum. </EM>And
what became of the atoms then? They lost their extension and they
retained only their property of resistance; they were the centres
of force. They were reduced to mathematical points . . . but if
their extension in space was nothing, <EM>so much fuller was their
inner life. </EM>Assuming that inner existence, such as that of
the human mind, is a new dimension, not a geometrical but a metaphysical
dimension . . . having reduced the geometrical extension of the
atoms to nothing, Leibnitz endowed them with an infinite extension
in the direction of their metaphysical dimension. After having
lost sight of them in the world of space, the mind has, as it
were, to dive into a metaphysical world to find and grasp the
real essence of what appears in space merely as a mathematical
point. . . . As a cone stands on its point, or a perpendicular
straight line cuts a horizontal plane only in one mathematical
point, but may extend infinitely in height and depth, so the essences
<EM>of things real </EM>have only a punctual existence in this
physical world of space; but have an infinite depth of inner life
in the metaphysical world of thought . . . &quot; (p. 144).
<P>
This is the spirit, the very root of occult doctrine and thought.
The &quot;Spirit-Matter&quot; and &quot;Matter-Spirit&quot; extend
infinitely <EM>in depth</EM>,<EM> </EM>and like &quot;the essence
of things&quot; of Leibnitz, our essence of things <EM>real </EM>is
<EM>at the seventh depth; </EM>while the <EM>unreal </EM>and gross
matter of Science and the external world, is at the lowest end
of our perceptive senses. The Occultist knows the worth or worthlessness
of the latter.
<P>
The student must now be shown the fundamental distinction between
the system of Leibnitz* and that of occult philosophy, on the
question of the Monads, and this may be done with his <EM>Monadology
</EM>before us. It may be correctly stated that were Leibnitz'
and Spinoza's systems
<H6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------

<P>
* The real spelling of the name -- as spelt by himself -- is Leibniz.
He was of Slavonian descent though a German by birth.<HR>

<P>
reconciled, the essence and Spirit of esoteric philosophy would
be made to appear. From the shock of the two -- as opposed to
the Cartesian system -- emerge the truths of the Archaic doctrine.
Both opposed the metaphysics of Descartes. His idea of the contrast
of two substances -- Extension and Thought -- radically differing
from each other and mutually irreducible, was too arbitrary and
too unphilosophical for them. Thus Leibnitz made of the two Cartesian
substances two attributes of one universal unity, in which he
saw God. Spinoza recognised but one universal indivisible substance
and absolute ALL, like Parabrahmam. Leibnitz, on the contrary
perceived the existence of a plurality of substances. There was
but ONE for Spinoza; for Leibnitz an infinitude of Beings, <EM>from</EM>,<EM>
</EM>and<EM> in</EM>, the One. Hence, though both admitted but
<EM>one real Entity</EM>,<EM> </EM>while Spinoza made it impersonal
and indivisible, Leibnitz divided his <EM>personal </EM>Deity
into a number of divine and semi-divine Beings. Spinoza was a
<EM>subjective</EM>,<EM> </EM>Leibnitz an <EM>objective </EM>Pantheist,
yet both were great philosophers in their intuitive perceptions.
<P>
Now, if these two teachings were blended together and each corrected
by the other, -- and foremost of all the One Reality weeded of
its personality -- there would remain as sum total a true spirit
of esoteric philosophy in them; the impersonal, attributeless,
absolute divine essence which is <EM>no </EM>&quot;Being,&quot;
but the root of all being. Draw a deep line in your thought between
that ever-incognizable essence, and the, as invisible, yet comprehensible
Presence (<EM>Mulaprakriti</EM>),<EM> </EM>or Schekinah, from
<EM>beyond and through which </EM>vibrates the Sound of the <EM>Verbum</EM>,<EM>
</EM>and from which evolve the numberless hierarchies of intelligent
<EM>Egos</EM>,<EM> </EM>of conscious as of semi-conscious, <EM>perceptive</EM>
and <EM>apperceptive </EM>Beings, whose essence is spiritual Force,
whose Substance is the Elements and whose Bodies (when needed)
are the <EM>atoms </EM>--<EM> </EM>and our doctrine is there.
For, says Leibnitz, &quot;the primitive Element of every material
body being Force, which has none of the characteristics of (<EM>objective</EM>)<EM>
</EM>matter -- it can be conceived but can never be the object
of any imaginative representation.&quot; That which was for him
the primordial and ultimate element in every body and object was
thus not the material atoms, or molecules, necessarily more or
less extended, as those of Epicurus and Gassendi, but, as Mertz
shows, immaterial and metaphysical atoms, 'mathematical points';
or <EM>real souls</EM>,<EM> </EM>--<EM> </EM>as explained by Henri
Lachelier (<EM>Professeur agrege de Philosophie</EM>),<EM> </EM>his
French biographer. &quot;That which exists outside of us in an
absolute manner, are Souls whose essence is force,&quot;<EM> </EM>(<EM>Monadologie</EM>,<EM>
Introd.</EM>)<EM>.</EM> 
<P>
Thus, <EM>reality </EM>in the manifested world is composed of
a <EM>unity of units</EM>,<EM> </EM>so to say, immaterial (from
our stand-point) and infinite. This Leibnitz calls &quot;Monads,&quot;
Eastern philosophy &quot;<EM>Jivas</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>--<EM>
</EM>and Occultism gives it, with the Kabalists and all the Christians,
a variety of names. <HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 630 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</H6>

<P>
They are with us, as with Leibnitz -- &quot;the expression of
the universe,&quot;* and every physical point is but the phenomenal
expression of the noumenal, metaphysical point. His distinction
between <EM>perception </EM>and<EM> apperception</EM>,<EM> </EM>is
the philosophical though dim expression of the Esoteric teachings.
His &quot;reduced universes,&quot; of which &quot;there are as
many as there are Monads&quot; -- is the chaotic representation
of our Septenary System with its divisions and sub-divisions.
<P>
As to the relation his Monads bear to our Dhyan-Chohans, Cosmic
Spirits, Devas and Elementals, we may reproduce briefly the opinion
of a learned and thoughtful theosophist, Mr. H. A. Bjerregaard,
on the subject. In an excellent paper &quot;On the Elementals,
the Elementary Spirits, and the relationship between them and
Human Beings,&quot; read by him before the &quot;Aryan Theosophical
Society of New York&quot; (see <STRONG>P</STRONG>ATH, Nos. 10
and 11, of Jan. and Feb. 1887), Mr. Bjerregaard formulates distinctly
his opinion. . . . . &quot;To Spinoza, substance is dead and inactive,
but to Leibnitz's penetrating mind everything is living activity
and active energy. In holding this view, <EM>he comes infinitely
nearer the Orient than any other thinker of his day</EM>,<EM>
or after him. </EM>His discovery that <EM>an active energy forms
the essence of Substance </EM>is a principle that <EM>places him
in direct relationship to the Seers of the East.</EM>&quot;
<P>
And the lecturer proceeds to show that to Leibnitz atoms and elements
are<EM> centres of force</EM>,<EM> </EM>or rather &quot;spiritual
beings whose very nature is to act,&quot; for the elementary particles
are not acting mechanically, but from an <EM>internal </EM>principle.
They are incorporeal spiritual units (&quot;substantial,&quot;
however, but not <EM>immaterial </EM>in our sense) inaccessible
to all changes from without, and indestructible by any external
force. Leibnitz's monads, adds the lecturer, &quot;differ from
atoms in the following particulars, which are very important for
us to remember, otherwise we shall not be able to see the difference
between elementals and mere matter.&quot; . . . . &quot;Atoms
are not distinguished from each other, they are qualitatively
alike; but one monad differs from every other monad qualitatively;
and every one is a peculiar world to itself. Not so with atoms;
they are absolutely alike quantitatively and qualitatively, and
possess no individuality of their own.** Again, the atoms (molecules,
<H6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
</H6>

<P>
* &quot;Leibnitz's Dynamism,&quot; says Professor Lachelier, &quot;would
offer but little difficulty if, with him, the Monad had remained
a simple atom of <EM>blind force. </EM>But . . . .&quot; One perfectly
understands the perplexity of modern materialism!
<P>
** Leibnitz was an <EM>absolute </EM>Idealist in maintaining that
&quot;material atoms are contrary to reason&quot; (<EM>Systeme
nouveau</EM>,<EM> </EM>Erdmann, p. 126. col. 2). For him <EM>matter
</EM>was a simple representation of the monad, whether human or
atomic. Monads, he thought (as we do), are everywhere. Thus the
human soul is a monad, and every cell in the human body has its
monad, as every cell in animal, vegetable, and even in the (so-called)
<EM>inorganic </EM>bodies. His <EM>atoms </EM>are the molecules
of modern Science, and his monads those <EM>simple </EM>[[Footnote

<P>
rather) of materialistic philosophy can be considered as extended
and divisible, while the monads are mere mathematical points and
indivisible. Finally, and this is a point where these monads of
Leibnitz closely resemble the elementals of mystic philosophy
-- these monads are representative Beings. Every monad reflects
every other. Every monad is a living mirror of the Universe within
its own sphere. And mark this, for upon it depends the power possessed
by these monads, and upon this depends the work they can do for
us; in mirroring the world, the monads are not mere passive reflective
agents, but <EM>spontaneously self</EM>-<EM>active</EM>; they
produce the images spontaneously, as the soul does a dream. In
every monad, therefore, the adept may read everything, even the
future. Every monad or <EM>Elemental </EM>is a looking-glass that
can speak. . .&quot;
<P>
It is at this point that Leibnitz's philosophy breaks down. There
is no provision made, nor any distinction established, between
the &quot;Elemental&quot; monad and that of a high Planetary Spirit,
or even the human monad or Soul. He even goes so far as to sometimes
doubt whether &quot;God has ever made anything but Monads or substances
without extension.&quot; (<EM>Examen des Principes du P. Malebranche.</EM>)<EM>
</EM>He<EM> </EM>draws a distinction between Monads and Atoms,*
because, as he repeatedly states, &quot;bodies with all their
qualities are only phenomenal, like the rainbow. . . . <EM>Corpora
omnia cum omnibus qualitatibus suis non sunt aliud quam phenomena
bene fundata</EM>,<EM> ut Iris</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>(Letter to
Father Desbosses, <EM>Correspondence</EM>,<EM> </EM>letter xviii.)
-- but soon after he finds a provision for this in a substantial
correspondence, a certain metaphysical bond between the monads
-- <EM>vinculum substantiale. </EM>Esoteric philosophy, teaching
an <EM>objective </EM>Idealism -- though it regards the objective
Universe and all in it as <EM>Maya</EM>,<EM> </EM>temporary illusion
-- draws a practical distinction between collective illusion,
<EM>Mahamaya</EM>,<EM> </EM>from the purely metaphysical stand-point,
and the objective relations in it between various conscious <EM>Egos
</EM>so long as this illusion lasts. The adept, therefore, <EM>may</EM>
read the future in an Elemental Monad, but he has to draw for
this object a great number of them, as each monad represents only
a portion of the Kingdom it belongs to. &quot;It is not in the
object, but in the modification of the cognition of the object
that the Monads are limited. They all go confusedly to the infinite,
to the all, but they are all limited and distinguished by the

</H6>

<P>
[[Footnote continued from previous page]] <EM>atoms </EM>that
materialistic Science takes on faith, though it will never succeed
in <EM>interviewing </EM>them -- except in imagination. But Leibnitz
is rather contradictory in his views about Monads. He speaks of
his <EM>Metaphysical Points </EM>and<EM> Formal Atoms</EM>,<EM>
</EM>at one time as <EM>realities</EM>,<EM> </EM>occupying space;
at another as pure Spiritual <EM>ideas; </EM>then again endows
them with objectivity and aggregates and positions in their co-relations.
<P>
* The <EM>atoms </EM>of Leibnitz have, in truth, nothing but the
name in common with the atoms of the Greek Materialists, or even
the <EM>molecules </EM>of modern Science. He calls them formal
atoms, and compares them to the substantial forms of Aristotle.

degrees of distinct perceptions.&quot; (&#167; 60, <EM>Monadologie</EM>.)*<EM>
</EM>And as Leibnitz explains, &quot;All the portions of the Universe
are distinctly represented in the Monads, <EM>but some are reflected
in one monad</EM>,<EM> some in another;</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>but
a number of monads could represent simultaneously the thoughts
of the two millions of inhabitants of Paris.
<P>
But what say the Occult Sciences to this, and what do they add?
<P>
They say that what is called collectively <EM>Monads </EM>by Leibnitz
-- roughly viewed, and leaving every subdivision out of calculation,
for the present** -- may be separated into three distinct Hosts,
which, counted from the highest planes, are, firstly, &quot;gods,&quot;
or conscious, spiritual <EM>Egos; </EM>the intelligent architects,
who work after the plan in the <EM>Divine Mind. </EM>Then come
the Elementals, or <EM>Monads</EM>,<EM> </EM>who form collectively
and unconsciously the grand Universal Mirrors of everything connected
with their respective realms. Lastly, the atoms, or material molecules,
which are informed in their turn by their <EM>apperceptive</EM>
monads, just as every cell in a human body is so informed. (See
the closing pages of Book I.) There are shoals of such <EM>informed
</EM>atoms which, in their turn, inform the molecules; an infinitude
of monads, or Elementals proper, and countless spiritual Forces
-- <EM>Monadless</EM>,<EM> </EM>for they are pure incorporealities,***
except under certain laws, when they assume a form -- not<EM>
necessarily human. </EM>Whence the substance that clothes them
-- the apparent organism they evolve around their centres? The
<EM>Formless </EM>(&quot;Arupa&quot;) Radiations, existing in
the harmony of Universal Will, and being what we term the collective
or the aggregate of Cosmic Will on the plane of the subjective
Universe, unite together an infinitude of monads -- each the mirror
of its own Universe -- and thus individualize
<H6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------

<P>
* Leibnitz, like Aristotle, calls the created or <EM>emanated
</EM>monads (the Elementals issued from Cosmic Spirits or Gods)

and &quot;incorporeal <EM>automata.</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>(&#167;

*** Brother C. H. A. Bjerregaard, in his lecture (already mentioned),
warns his audience not to regard the <EM>Sephiroth </EM>too much
as <EM>individualities</EM>,<EM> </EM>but to avoid at the same
time seeing in them <EM>abstractions. </EM>&quot;We shall never
arrive at the truth,&quot; he says, &quot;much less the power
of <EM>associating with those celestials</EM>,<EM> </EM>until
we return to the simplicity and fearlessness of the primitive
ages, when men mixed freely with the gods, and the gods descended
among men and guided them in truth and holiness&quot; (No. 10,<EM>
Path</EM>)<EM> </EM>. . . . &quot;There are several designations
for 'angels' in the Bible which clearly show that beings like
the Elementals of the Kabala and the monads of Leibnitz, must
be understood by that term rather than that which is commonly
understood. They are called 'morning stars,' 'flaming fires,'
'the mighty ones,' and St. Paul sees them in his cosmogonic vision
as 'Principalities and Powers.' Such names as these preclude the
idea of personality, and we find ourselves compelled to think
of them as impersonal Existences . . . as an <EM>influence</EM>,<EM>
</EM>a spiritual substance, or <EM>conscious Force.</EM>&quot;

for the time being an independent mind, omniscient and universal;
and by the same process of magnetic aggregation they create for
themselves objective, visible bodies, out of the interstellar
atoms. For atoms and Monads, associated or dissociated, simple
or complex, are, from the moment of the first differentiation,
but the <EM>principles</EM>,<EM> </EM>corporeal, psychic and Spiritual,
of the &quot;Gods,&quot; -- themselves the Radiations of primordial
nature. Thus, to the eye of the Seer, the higher Planetary Powers
appear under two aspects: the subjective -- <EM>as influences</EM>,<EM>
</EM>and the objective -- as mystic FORMS, which, under Karmic
law, become a <EM>Presence</EM>,<EM> </EM>Spirit and Matter being
One, as repeatedly stated. Spirit is matter <EM>on the seventh
plane; </EM>matter is Spirit -- on the lowest point of its cyclic
activity; and both -- are <STRONG>M</STRONG>AYA.
<P>
Atoms are called &quot;Vibrations&quot; in Occultism; also &quot;Sound&quot;
-- collectively. This does not interfere with Mr. Tyndall's scientific
discovery. He traced, on the lower rung of the ladder of monadic
being, the whole course of the <EM>atmospheric vibrations </EM>--<EM>
</EM>and this constitutes the <EM>objective </EM>part of the process
in nature. He has traced and recorded the rapidity of their motion
and transmission; the force of their impact; their setting up
vibrations in the tympanum and their transmission of these to
the stolithes, etc., etc., till the vibration of the auditory
nerve commences -- and a new phenomenon now takes place: the <EM>subjective
side </EM>of the process or <EM>the sensation of Sound. </EM>Does
he perceive or see it? No; for his speciality is to discover the
behaviour of matter. But why should not a psychic see it, a spiritual
seer, whose inner Eye is opened, and who can see through the veil
of matter? The waves and undulations of Science are all produced
by atoms propelling their molecules into activity <EM>from within.
</EM>Atoms fill the immensity of Space, and by their continuous
vibration <EM>are </EM>that MOTION which keeps the wheels of Life
perpetually going. It is that inner work that produces the natural
phenomena called the correlation of Forces. Only, at the origin
of every such &quot;force,&quot; there stands the <EM>conscious
</EM>guiding noumenon thereof -- Angel or God, Spirit or Demon
-- ruling powers, yet the same.
<P>
As described by Seers -- those who can see the motion of the interstellar
shoals, and follow them in their evolution clairvoyantly -- they
are dazzling, like specks of virgin snow in radiant sunlight.
Their velocity is swifter than thought, quicker than any mortal
physical eye could follow, and, as well as can be judged from
the tremendous rapidity of their course, the motion is circular.
. . . . Standing on an open plain, on a mountain summit especially,
and gazing into the vast vault above and the spacial infinitudes
around, the whole atmosphere seems ablaze with them, the air soaked
through with these dazzling coruscations. At times, the intensity
of their motion produces flashes<HR>

like the Northern lights during the <EM>Aurora Borealis. </EM>The
sight is so marvellous, that, as the Seer gazes into this inner
world, and feels the scintillating points shoot past him, he is
filled with awe at the thought of other, still greater mysteries,
that lie beyond, and within, this radiant ocean. . . . .
<P>
However imperfect and incomplete this explanation on &quot;Gods,
Monads and Atoms,&quot; it is hoped that some students and theosophists,
at least, will feel that there may be indeed a close relation
between materialistic Science, and Occultism, which is the complement
and missing soul of the former.
