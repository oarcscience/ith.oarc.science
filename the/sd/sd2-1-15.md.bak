**A** **P**ANORAMIC **V**IEW OF THE **E**ARLY **R**ACES.

There is a period of a few millions of years to cover between the first
"mindless" race and the highly intelligent and *intellectual* later
"Lemurians"; there is another between the earliest civilization of the
Atlanteans and the historic period.

As witnesses to the Lemurians but a few silent records in the shape of
half a dozen broken colossi and old cyclopean ruins are left. These are
not allowed a hearing, as they are "productions of blind natural
forces," we are assured by some; "quite modern" we are told by others.
Tradition is left contemptuously unnoticed by sceptic and materialist,
and made subservient to the Bible in every case by the too zealous
Churchman. Whenever a legend, however, refuses to fit in with the
Noachian "deluge theory," it is declared by the Christian clergy "the
insanely delirious voice of old superstition." Atlantis is denied, when
not confused with Lemuria and other departed continents, because,
perhaps, Lemuria is half the creation of modern science, and has,
therefore, to be believed in; while Plato's Atlantis is regarded by most
of the scientists as a dream.

Atlantis is often described by believers in Plato as a prolongation of
Africa. An old continent is also suspected to have existed on the
Eastern coast. Only Africa, as a continent, was never part and parcel of
either Lemuria or Atlantis, as we have agreed to call the Third and
Fourth Continents. Their archaic appellations are never mentioned in the

Puranas, nor anywhere else. But with simply one of the esoteric keys in
hand it becomes an easy task to identify these departed lands in the
numberless "lands of the gods," Devas and Munis described in the
Puranas, in their *Varshas, Dwipas,* and *zones.* Their Sweta-Dwipa,
during the early day of Lemuria, stood out like a giant-peak from the
bottom of the sea; the area between Atlas and Madagascar being occupied
by the waters till about the early period of Atlantis (after the
disappearance of Lemuria), when Africa emerged from the bottom of the
ocean, and Atlas was half-sunk.

It is of course impossible to attempt, within the compass of even
several volumes, a consecutive and detailed account of the evolution and
progress of the first three races -- except so far as to give a general
view of it, as will be done presently. Race the first had no history of
its own. Of race the second the same may be said. We shall have,
therefore, to pay careful attention only to the Lemurians and the
Atlanteans before the history of our own race (the Fifth) can be
attempted.

What is known of other continents, besides our own, and what does
history know or accept of the early races? Everything outside the
repulsive speculations of materialistic science is daubed with the
contemptuous term "Superstition." The wise men of to-day will believe
nothing. Plato's "winged" and *hermaphrodite* races, and his golden age,
under the reign of Saturn and the gods, are quietly brought back by
Haeckel to their *new* place in nature: our divine races are shown to be
the descendants of Catarrhine apes, and our ancestor, a piece of sea
slime.

Nevertheless, as expressed by Faber, "the *fictions* of ancient poetry .
. . . will be found to comprehend some portion of historical truth."
However one-sided the efforts of the learned author of the "*Mysteries
of the Kabiri,*" *--* efforts directed throughout his two volumes to
constrain the classical myths and symbols of old paganism, "to bear
testimony to the truth of Scripture," -- time and further research have
avenged, partially at least, that "truth" by showing it *unveiled.* Thus
it is the clever adaptations of Scripture, on the contrary, which are
made to bear evidence to the great wisdom of archaic paganism. This,
notwithstanding the inextricable confusion into which the truth about
the Kabiri -- the most mysterious gods of antiquity -- was thrown by the
wild and contradictory speculations of Bishop Cumberland, Dr. Shuckford,
Cudworth, Vallancey, etc., etc., and finally by Faber. Nevertheless,
all, from first to last, of these scholars had to come to a certain
conclusion framed by the latter. "We have no reason to think," he
writes, "that the idolatry of the Gentile world was of a merely
arbitrary contrivance; on the contrary, it seems to have been built,
almost universally, *upon a traditional remembrance of certain real
events. These events I apprehend to be the destruction of*

*the first* (the fourth in esoteric teachings) *Race of mankind by the
waters of the Deluge.*" (*Chap. I. p.* 9). To this, Faber adds: --

> "I am persuaded that the tradition of the sinking of the Phlegian isle
> is the very same as that of the sinking of the island Atlantis. They
> both appear to me to allude to one great event, the sinking of the
> whole world beneath the waters of the deluge, or, if we suppose the
> arch of the earth to have remained in its original position, the
> rising of the central water above it. M. Bailly, indeed, in his work
> upon the Atlantis of Plato, the object of which is evidently to
> depreciate the authority of Scriptural chronology, labours to prove
> that the Atlanteans were a very ancient northern nation, long prior to
> the Hindoos, the Phoenicians, and the Egyptians." (*"A Dissertation on
> the Kabiri," p.* 284.)

In this Faber is in agreement with Bailly, who shows himself more
learned and intuitional than those who accept Biblical chronology. Nor
is the latter wrong when saying that the Atlanteans were the same as the
Titans and the giants. (*See* "*Lettres sur l*'*Atlantide.*") Faber
adopts the more willingly the opinion of his French *confrere,* as
Bailly mentions Cosmas Indico-Pleustes, who preserved an ancient
tradition about Noah -- that he "formerly inhabited the *island*
Atlantis" (*ibid*). This island, whether it was the "Poseidonis"
mentioned in "Esoteric Buddhism," or the Continent of Atlantis, does not
much matter. The tradition is there, recorded by a Christian.

No Occultist would ever think of dispossessing Noah of his prerogatives,
if he is claimed to be an Atlantean; for this would simply show that the
Israelites repeated the story of Vaivasvata Manu, Xisuthrus, and so many
others, and that they only changed the name, to do which they had the
same right as any other nation or tribe. What we object to is the
literal acceptation of Biblical chronology, as it is absurd, and in
accord with neither geological data nor reason. Moreover, if Noah was an
Atlantean, then he was a Titan, a giant, as Faber shows; and if a giant,
then why is he not shown as such in *Genesis?\**

Bailly's mistake was to reject the submersion of Atlantis, and to call
the Atlanteans simply a Northern and *post diluvian* nation, which,
however, as he says, certainly "flourished before the foundation of the
Hindu, the Egyptian, and the Phoenician empires." In this, had

###### \[\[Footnote(s)\]\] -------------------------------------------------

\* This is shown by Faber, again a pious Christian, who says that "the
Noetic family also . . . bore the appellations of *Atlanteans* and
*Titans,* and the great patriarch himself was called by way of eminence
*Atlas* and *Titan.*" (*Vol. II. p.* 285). And if so, then, *according
to the Bible,* Noah must have been the progeny of the Sons of God, the
*fallen* *angels,* agreeably to the same authority, and of the
"daughters of men who were fair," (*See Genesis, chap.* vi.) And why
not, since his father Lamech slew a man, and was, with all his sons and
daughters (who perished in the Deluge), as bad as the rest of mankind?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

###### \[\[Vol. 2, Page\]\] 266 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.

he only known of the existence of what we have agreed to call *Lemuria,*
he would have again been right. For the Atlanteans were *post diluvian*
to the Lemurians, and Lemuria was not submerged as Atlantis was, but was
*sunk* under the waves, owing to earthquakes and subterranean fires, as
Great Britain and Europe will be one day. It is the ignorance of our men
of science, who will accept neither the tradition that several
continents have already sunk, nor the periodical law which acts
throughout the Manvantaric cycle -- it is this ignorance that is the
chief cause of all the confusion. Nor is Bailly wrong again in assuring
us that the Hindus, Egyptians, and Phoenicians came after the
Atlanteans, for the latter belonged to the Fourth, while the Aryans and
their Semitic Branch are of the Fifth Race. Plato, while repeating the
story as narrated to Solon by the priests of Egypt, intentionally
confuses (as every *Initiate* would) the two continents, and assigns to
the small island which sunk last all the events pertaining to the two
enormous continents, the prehistoric and traditional. Therefore, he
describes the *first couple,* from whom the whole island was peopled, as
being formed of the Earth. In saying so, he means neither Adam and Eve,
nor yet his own Hellenic forefathers. His language is simply
allegorical, and by alluding to "Earth," he means "matter," as the
Atlanteans were really the first purely *human* and *terrestrial* race
-- those that preceded it being more divine and ethereal than human and
solid.

Yet Plato must have known, as would any other initiated adept, about the
history of the Third Race after its "Fall," though as one pledged to
silence and secrecy he never showed his knowledge in so many words.
Nevertheless, it may become easier now, after acquainting oneself with
even the approximate chronology of the Eastern nations -- all of which
was based upon, and followed the early Aryan calculations -- to realize
the immense periods of time that must have elapsed since the separation
of the sexes, without mentioning the First or even the Second
Root-Races. As these must remain beyond the comprehension of minds
trained in Western thought, it is found useless to speak in detail of
the First and Second, and even of the Third Race in its earliest
stage.\* One has to begin with the latter, when it reached its full
human period, lest the uninitiated reader should find himself hopelessly
bewildered.

###### \[\[Footnote(s)\]\] -------------------------------------------------

\* In that wonderful volume of Donnelly's "Atlantis, the Antediluvian
World," the author, speaking of the Aryan colonies from Atlantis, and of
the arts and sciences the legacy of our Fourth Race -- bravely announces
that "the roots of the institutions of to-day reach back to the Miocene
age." This is an enormous allowance for a modern scholar to make; but
civilization dates still further back than the Miocene Atlanteans.
"Secondary-period" man will be discovered, and with him his long
forgotten civilization.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

###### \[\[Vol. 2, Page\]\] 267 THE NATURAL "FALL."

The THIRD RACE FELL -- and created no longer: it *begot* its progeny.
Being still mindless at the period of separation it begot, moreover,
anomalous offspring, until its physiological nature had adjusted its
instincts in the right direction. Like the "lords the gods" of the Bible
' the "Sons of Wisdom," the Dhyan-Chohans, had warned them to leave
alone the fruit forbidden by Nature: but the warning proved of no value.
Men realized the unfitness -- we must not say sin -- of what they had
done, only when too late: after the angelic monads from higher spheres
had incarnated in, and endowed them with understanding. To that day they
had remained simply physical, like the animals generated from them. For
what is the distinction? The doctrine teaches that the only difference
between animate and inanimate objects on earth, between an animal and a
human frame, is that in some the various "fires" are latent, and in
others they are active. The *vital fires* are in all things and not an
atom is devoid of them. But no animal has the three higher principles
awakened in him; they are simply potential, latent, and thus
*non-existing.* And so would the animal frames of men be to this day,
had they been left as they came out from the bodies of their
Progenitors, whose *shadows* they were, to grow, unfolded only by the
powers and forces immanent in matter. But as said in **P**YMANDER: --

"This is a Mystery that to this day was sealed and hidden. Nature\*
being mingled with Man\*\* brought forth a wondrous miracle; the
harmonious commingling *of the essence of the Seven* (Pitris, governors)
and her own; the *Fire* and the *Spirit* and Nature (the noumenon of
matter); which (commingling) forthwith brought forth seven men of
opposite sexes (negative and positive) according to the essences of the
seven governors." (*Divine Pymander, Chap. I., Sect.* 16.)

Thus saith Hermes, the thrice great Initiate,\*\*\* "the Power of the

###### \[\[Footnote(s)\]\] -------------------------------------------------

\* Nature is the *natural* body, the shadow of the Progenitors; and --

\*\* MAN is the "Heavenly man," as already stated.

\*\*\* The "Pymander" of our museums and libraries is an abridgement of
one of the Books of Thoth, by a Platonist of Alexandria. In the Third
Century it was remodelled after old Hebrew and Phoenician **MSS**. by a
Jewish Kabalist, and called the "Genesis of Enoch." But even its
disfigured remnants show how closely its text agrees with the Archaic
Doctrine, as is shown in the creation of the Seven Creators and *seven
primitive men*. As to Enoch, Thoth or Hermes, Orpheus and Kadmus, these
are all generic names, branches and offshoots of the seven primordial
sages (incarnated Dhyan Chohans or Devas, in *illusive,* not mortal
bodies) who taught Humanity all it knew, and whose earliest disciples
assumed their master's names. This custom passed from the Fourth to the
Fifth Race. Hence the sameness of the traditions about Hermes (of whom
Egyptologists count five) Enoch, etc., they are all inventors of
letters; none of them dies but still lives, and they are the first
Initiators into, and Founders of the Mysteries. *The Genesis of Enoch*
disappeared only very lately among the Kabalists. Guillaume \[\[Footnote

Thought Divine." St. Paul, another Initiate, called our world "the
enigmatical mirror of pure truth," and St. Gregory, of Nazianzen,
corroborated Hermes by stating that "things visible are but the shadow
and delineation of things that we cannot see." It is an eternal
combination, and images are repeated from the higher rung of the ladder
of being down to the lower. The "Fall of the Angels," and the "War in
Heaven" are repeated on every plane, the lower "mirror" disfiguring the
image of the superior mirror, and each repeating it in its own way. Thus
the Christian dogmas are but the reminiscences of the *paradigms* of
Plato, who spoke of these things cautiously, as every Initiate would.
But it is all as expressed in these few sentences of the *Desatir: -*-

"All that is on Earth, saith the Lord (Ormazd), is the *shadow of
something that is in the superior spheres.* This luminous object (light,
fire, etc.) is the shadow of that which is still more luminous than
itself, and so on till it reaches ME, who am the light of lights."

In the Kabalistic books, and in the *Zohar* pre-eminently, the idea that
everything objective on earth or in this Universe is the Shadow --
*Dyooknah* -- of the eternal Light or Deity, is very strong.

The Third Race was pre-eminently the bright shadow, at first, of the
gods, whom tradition exiles on Earth after the allegorical war in
Heaven; which became still more allegorical on Earth, for it was the war
between spirit and matter. This war will last till the inner and divine
man adjusts his outer terrestrial self to his own spiritual nature. Till
then the dark and fierce passions of the former will be at eternal feud
with his master, the Divine Man. But the *animal* will be tamed one day,
because its nature will be changed, and harmony will reign once more
between the two as before the "Fall," when even mortal man was *created*
by the Elements and was not born.

The above is made clear in all the great theogonies, principally in the
Grecian (*see Hesiod and Theogony*)*. The mutilation* of *Uranos* by his
son *Kronos,* who thus condemns him to impotency, has never been
understood by the modern Mythographers. Yet, it is very plain; and
having been universal\* (*vide foot note infra*)*,* it must have
contained a great abstract

\[\[Footnote continued from previous page\]\] Postel saw it. It was most
certainly in a great measure a transcript from the books of Hermes, and
far anterior to the Books of Moses, as Eliphas Levi tells his readers.

\* Uranos is a modified Varuna, "the Universal encompasser," the
all-embracer, and one of the oldest of the Vedic deities -- **S**PACE,
the maker of Heaven and Earth, since both are manifested out of his (or
its) seed. It is only later that Varuna became the chief of the Adityas
and a kind of Neptune riding on the *Leviathan -- Makara,* now the most
sacred and mysterious of the signs of the Zodiac. Varuna, "without whom
no creature can even wink," was degraded like Uranos, and, like him, *he
fell into generation,* his functions, "the grandest cosmical functions,"
as Muir calls them, having been lowered down from heaven to earth by
exoteric anthropomorphism. As the same \[\[Footnote continued on next

and philosophical idea, now lost to our modern sages. This punishment in
the allegory marks, indeed "a new period, a second phase in the
development of creation," as justly remarked by Decharme (*Mythologie de
la Grece Antique, p.* 7), who, however, renounces the attempt to explain
it. Uranos has tried to oppose an impediment to that development, or
natural evolution, by *destroying all his children as soon as born.
Uranos,* who personifies all the creative powers of, and in, *Chaos*
(Space, or the unmanifested Deity) is thus made to pay the penalty; for
it is those powers which cause the *Pitris* to evolve primordial *men*
from themselves -- as, later on, these men evolve *their* progeny --
without any sense or desire for procreation. The work of generation,
suspended during a moment, passes into the hands of *Kronos,\* time,*
who unites himself with *Rhea* (the earth in esotericism -- matter in
general), and thus produces, after celestial -- terrestrial Titans. The
whole of this symbolism relates to the mysteries of Evolution.

This allegory is the exoteric version of the esoteric doctrine given in
this part of our work. For in *Kronos* we see the same story repeated
again. As Uranos destroyed his children from *Gaia* (one, in the world
of manifestation, with Aditi or the Great Cosmic Deep) by confining them
in the bosom of the Earth, *Tythea, so Kronos* at this second stage of
creation destroyed his children from *Rhea --* by devouring them. This
is an allusion to the fruitless efforts of Earth or Nature alone to
create real *human* men. (*See our Stanzas III. -- X., et seq., and also
Berosus*' *account of primeval creation.*) Time swallows its own
fruitless work. Then comes Zeus -- Jupiter, who dethrones his father in
his turn.\*\* Jupiter the Titan, is Prometheus, in one sense,\*\*\* and
varies from Zeus, the Great

\[\[Footnote continued from previous page\]\] Orientalist says, "The
attributes ascribed to Varuna (in the Vedas) impart to his character a
moral elevation and sanctity far surpassing that attributed to any other
Vedic Deity." But to understand correctly the reason of his fall, like
that of Uranos, one has to see in every exoteric religion the imperfect
and sinful work of man's fancy, and also to study the mysteries which
Varuna is said to have imparted to Vasishta. Only . . . "his secrets and
those of Mitra *are not to be revealed to the foolish.*"

*\* Kronos* is not only \[\[*Chronos*\]\], *time*, but also, as Breal
showed in his *Hercule et Cacus* (p. 57), comes from the root *Kar*, "to
make, to create." Whether Breal and Decharme, who quotes him, are as
right in saying that in the Vedas *Kronan* is a creative god, we have
our doubts. Breal probably meant Karma, or rather Visva-Karma, the
creative god, the "Omnificent" and the "great Architect of the world."

\*\* The Titanic struggle, in theogony at least, is the fight for
supremacy between the children of *Uranos* and *Gaia* (or Heaven and
Earth in their abstract sense), the Titans, against the children of
*Kronos,* whose chief is Zeus. It is the everlasting struggle going on
to this day between the spiritual inner man and the man of flesh, in one
sense.

\*\*\* Just as the "Lord God," or Jehovah, is Cain esoterically, and the
"tempting serpent" as well, the male portion of the androgynous Eve,
before her "Fall;" the female portion of Adam Kadmon; the left side or
Binah of the right side Chochmah in the first Sephirothal Triad.

"Father of the Gods." He is the "disrespectful son" in Hesiod. Hermes
calls him the "Heavenly man" (Pymander); and even in the Bible he is
found again under the name of Adam, and, later on -- by transmutation --
under that of Ham. Yet these are all personifications of the "sons of
Wisdom." The necessary corroboration that Jupiter belongs to the purely
*human Atlantean cycle -- if Uranus* and *Kronos* who precede him are
found insufficient -- may be found in Hesiod, who tells us that the
Immortals have made men and created the Golden and the Silver age (First
and Second Races); while Jupiter created the generations of Bronze (an
admixture of *two* elements), of Heroes, and the men of the age of Iron.
After this he sends his fatal present, by Pandora, to Epimetheus,\*
which present Hesiod calls "a fatal gift," or the *first woman.* It was
a punishment, he explains, sent to man "for the theft of divine creative
fire." Her apparition on earth is the signal of every kind of evil.
Before her appearance, the human races lived happy, exempt from sickness
and suffering -- as the same races are made to live under Yima's rule,
in the Mazdean *Vendidad.*

Two deluges may also be traced in universal tradition by carefully
comparing Hesiod, the Rig Veda, the Zend-Avesta, etc., while no *first*
man is ever mentioned in any of the theogonies save the Bible.\*\*
Everywhere the man of *our race* appears after a cataclysm of water,
after which tradition mentions only the several designations of
continents and islands which sink under the ocean waves in due
time.\*\*\* "Gods and mortals have one common origin" says Hesiod
(*ibid. v*. 108); and Pindar echoes the statement (*Nem. VI.,* 1).
Deucalion and Pyrrha, who escape the Deluge by constructing an ark like
Noah's (*see Apollod.,* 1, 7, 2, *and Ovid, Metam.* I, 260, 899.), ask
Jupiter to re-animate the human race whom he had made to perish under
the waters of the Flood. In the Slavonian Mythology (*Lithuanian legend,
in Grimm, Deutsche Myth.* 1, 545), all men were drowned, and two old
people, a man and his wife, alone remained. Then *Pram-gimas* (the
"master of all") advised them to jump *seven times* on the rocks of the
earth, and *seven new races* (couples) were born, from which came the
nine Lithuanian tribes. As well understood by the author of the
*Mythologie de la Grece Antique --* the four ages

the Bulaq Museum), called the "two Brothers," the original of Pandora is
given. *Noum,* the famous heavenly artist, creates a marvellous beauty,
a girl which he sends to *Batoo,* after which the happiness of the
latter is destroyed. Batoo is man, and the girl Eve, of course. (*See
Maspero*'*s Egyptian Legends, and also Decharme*'*s* "*Mythologie de la

signify periods of time, and are also an allegorical allusion to the
races. "The successive races, destroyed and replaced by others," he
says, "without any period of transition, are characterized in Greece by
the name of metals, to express their ever-decreasing value. Gold, the
most brilliant and precious of all, symbol of purity . . . . qualifies
the first race. . . . . The men of the second race, those of the age of
Silver, are already inferior to the first. Inert and weak creatures, all
their life is no better than a long and stupid infancy. . . . They
disappear. . . . The men of the age of Bronze are robust and violent
(the third race); their strength is extreme. They had arms made of
bronze, habitations of bronze; used nought but bronze. Iron, the black
metal, was yet unknown" (*Op. at D.,* 143-155). The fourth generation
(race) is, with Hesiod, that of the heroes who fell before Thebes (see
"*The Seven Against Thebes,*" by AEschylus), or under the walls of Troy.

Thus, the four races being found mentioned by the oldest Greek poets,
though very much confused anachronistically, our doctrines are once more
corroborated by the classics. But this is all "Mythology" and poetry.
What can modern science have to say to such an euhemerization of old
fictions? The verdict is not difficult to foresee. Therefore an attempt
must be made to answer by anticipation, and prove that fictions and
*empirical* speculations are so much of the domain of that same science,
that none of the men of learning have the slightest right, with such a
heavy beam in their own eye, to point to the speck in the eye of the
Occultist, even if that speck be not a figment of our opponents'
imagination.

memory of whom lingered from one generation and race to another
generation and race down to the days of Moses, and which found an
objective form in those antediluvian giants, those terrible sorcerers
and magicians, of whom the Roman Church has preserved such vivid and at
the same time distorted legends. One who has read and studied the
Commentaries on the archaic doctrine, will easily recognise in some
Atlanteans, the prototypes of the Nimrods, the Builders of the Tower of
Babel, the Hamites, and all these *tutti quanti* of "accursed memory,"
as theological literature expresses it: of those, in short, who have
furnished posterity with the orthodox types of Satan. And this leads us
naturally to inquire into the religious ethics of these early races,
mythical as these may be.

What was the religion of the Third and Fourth Races? In the common
acceptation of the term, neither the Lemurians, nor yet their progeny,
the Lemuro-Atlanteans, had any, as they knew no dogma, nor had they to
believe *on faith.* No sooner had the mental eye of man been opened to
understanding, than the Third Race felt itself one with the ever-present
as the ever to be unknown and invisible ALL, the One Universal Deity.
Endowed with divine powers, and feeling in himself his *inner* God, each
felt he was a Man-God in his nature, though an animal in his physical
Self. The struggle between the two began from the very day they tasted
of the fruit of the Tree of Wisdom; a struggle for life between the
spiritual and the psychic, the psychic and the physical. Those who
conquered the lower principles by obtaining mastery over the body,
joined the "Sons of Light." Those who fell victims to their lower
natures, became the slaves of Matter. From "Sons of Light and Wisdom"
they ended by becoming the "Sons of Darkness." They had fallen in the
battle of mortal life with Life immortal, and all those so fallen became
the seed of the future generations of Atlanteans.\*

At the dawn of his consciousness, the man of the Third Root Race had
thus no beliefs that could be called *religion.* That is to say, he was
equally as ignorant of "gay religions, full of pomp and gold" as of any
system of faith or outward worship. But if the term is to be defined as
the binding together of the masses in one form of reverence paid to
those we feel higher than ourselves, of piety -- as a feeling expressed
by a child toward a loved parent -- then even the earliest Lemurians had
a religion -- and a most beautiful one -- from the very beginning of
their intellectual life. Had they not their bright gods of the elements

"sorcerers." The Atlantean races were many, and lasted in their
evolution for millions of years: all were not bad. They became so toward
their end, as we (the fifth) are fast becoming now.

them, and even within themselves?\* Was not their childhood passed with,
nursed and tendered by those who had given them life and called them
forth to intelligent, conscious life? We are assured it was so, and we
believe it. For the evolution of Spirit into matter could never have
been achieved; nor would it have received its first impulse, had not the
bright Spirits sacrificed their own respective super-ethereal essences
to animate the man of clay, by endowing each of his inner principles
with a portion, or rather, a reflection of that essence. The Dhyanis of
the Seven Heavens (the seven planes of Being) are the NOUMENOI of the
actual and the future Elements, just as the Angels of the Seven Powers
of nature - the grosser effects of which are perceived by us in what
Science is pleased to call the "modes of motion" -- the imponderable
forces and what not -- are the still higher noumenoi of still higher
Hierarchies.

It was the "Golden Age" in those days of old, the age when the "gods
walked the earth, and mixed freely with the mortals." Since then, the
gods departed (*i.e.*, became invisible), and later generations ended by
worshipping their kingdoms -- the Elements.

It was the Atlanteans, the first progeny of *semi-divine* man after his
separation into sexes -- hence the first-begotten and humanly-born
mortals -- who became the first "Sacrificers" to the *god of matter.*
They stand in the far-away dim past, in ages more than prehistoric, as
the prototype on which the great symbol of Cain was built,\*\* as the
first anthropomorphists who worshipped form and matter. That worship
degenerated very soon into *self-worship,* thence led to phallicism, or
that which reigns supreme to this day in the symbolisms of every
exoteric religion of ritual, dogma, and form. Adam and Eve *became
matter,* or furnished the soil, Cain and Abel -- the latter the
life-bearing soil, the former "the tiller of that ground or field."

Thus the first Atlantean races, born on the Lemurian Continent,
separated from their earliest tribes into the righteous and the
unrighteous; into those who worshipped the one unseen Spirit of Nature,
the ray of which man feels within himself -- or the Pantheists, and
those who offered fanatical worship to the Spirits of the Earth, the
dark Cosmic, anthropomorphic Powers, with whom they made alliance. These
were the earliest *Gibborim,* "the mighty men of renown in those

\* The "Gods of the Elements" are by no means the Elementals. The latter
are at best used by them as vehicles and materials in which to clothe
themselves. . . . .

\*\* Cain was the *sacrificer,* as shown at first in chap. iv. of
*Genesis,* of "the fruit of the ground," of which he was *first tiller*,
while Abel "brought of the firstlings of his flock" to the Lord. Cain is
the symbol of the first male, Abel of the first female humanity, Adam
and Eve being the types of the third race. (See "*The Mystery of Cain
and* *Abel.*") The "murdering" is blood-shedding, but not taking life.

days" (*Gen.* vi.); who become with the Fifth Race the *Kabirim:* Kabiri
with the Egyptians and the Phoenicians, Titans with the Greeks, and
Rakshasas and Daityas with the Indian races.

Such was the secret and mysterious origin of all the subsequent and
modern religions, especially of the worship of the later Hebrews for
their tribal god. At the same time this sexual religion was closely
allied to, based upon and blended, so to say, with astronomical
phenomena. The Lemurians gravitated toward the North Pole, or the Heaven
of their Progenitors (the Hyperborean Continent); the Atlanteans, toward
the Southern Pole, the *pit*, cosmically and terrestrially -- whence
breathe the hot passions blown into hurricanes by the cosmic Elementals,
whose abode it is. The two poles were denominated, by the ancients,
Dragons and Serpents -- hence good and bad Dragons and Serpents, and
also the names given to the "Sons of God" (Sons of Spirit and Matter):
the good and bad Magicians. This is the origin of this dual and triple
nature in man. The legend of the "Fallen Angels" in its esoteric
signification, contains the key to the manifold contradictions of human
character; it points to the secret of man's self-consciousness; it is
the angle-iron on which hinges his entire life-cycle; -- the history of
his evolution and growth.

On a firm grasp of this doctrine depends the correct understanding of
esoteric anthropogenesis. It gives a clue to the vexed question of the
Origin of Evil; and shows how man himself is the separator of the
**O**NE into various contrasted aspects.

The reader, therefore, will not be surprised if so considerable space is
devoted in each case to an attempt to elucidate this difficult and
obscure subject. A good deal must necessarily be said on its
symbological aspect; because, by so doing, hints are given to the
thoughtful student for his own investigations, and more light can thus
be suggested than it is possible to convey in the technical phrases of a
more formal, philosophical exposition. The "Fallen Angels," so-called,
are *Humanity* *itself.* The Demon of Pride, Lust, Rebellion, and
Hatred, has never had *any being before* the appearance of physical
conscious man. It is man who has begotten, nurtured, and allowed the
fiend to develop in his heart; he, again, who has contaminated the
indwelling god in himself, by linking the pure spirit with the impure
demon of matter. And, if the Kabalistic saying, "*Demon est Deus
inversus*" finds its metaphysical and theoretical corroboration in dual
manifested nature, its practical application is found in Mankind alone.

Thus it has now become self-evident that postulating as we do (*a*) the
appearance of man before that of other mammalia, and even before the
ages of the huge reptiles; (*b*) periodical deluges and glacial periods
owing to the karmic disturbance of the axis; and chiefly (*c*) the birth
of man

from a Superior Being, or what materialism would call a *supernatural*
Being, though it is only super-*human* -- it is evident that our
teachings have very few chances of an impartial hearing. Add to it the
claim that a portion of the Mankind in the Third Race -- all those
Monads of men who had reached the highest point of Merit and *Karma* in
the preceding Manvantara -- owed their psychic and *rational* natures to
divine Beings *hypostasizing* into their fifth principles, and the
*Secret* *Doctrine* must lose caste in the eyes of not only Materialism
but even of dogmatic Christianity. For, no sooner will the latter have
learned that those angels are identical with their "Fallen" Spirits,
than the esoteric tenet will be proclaimed most terribly heretical and
pernicious.\* The *divine* man dwelt in the animal, and, therefore, when
the physiological separation took place in the natural course of
evolution -- when also "all the animal creation was *untied,*" and males
were attracted to *females -- that race fell:* not because they had
eaten of the fruit of Knowledge and knew good from evil, but because
they knew no better. Propelled by the sexless creative instinct, the
early sub-races had evolved an intermediate race in which, as hinted in
the Stanzas, the higher Dhyan-Chohans had incarnated.\*\* "When we have
ascertained the extent of the Universe and learnt to know all that there
is in it, we will multiply our race," answer the *Sons of Will and Yoga*
to their brethren of the same race, who invite them to do as they do.
This means that the great Adepts and Initiated ascetics will "multiply,"
*i.e*., once more produce *Mind-born* immaculate Sons -- in the Seventh
Root-Race.

It is so stated in the Puranas; in *Adi Parvan* (*p.* 115) and *Brahma*
*Purana,* etc. In one portion of the *Pushkara Mahatmya,* moreover, the
separation of the sexes is allegorized by Daksha, who, seeing that his
will-born progeny (the "Sons of passive Yoga"), will not create men,
"*converts half himself into a female* by whom he begets daughters," the
future females of the Third Race which begat the giants of Atlantis,

\* It is, perhaps, with an eye to this *degradation* of the highest and
purest Spirits, who broke through the intermediate planes of lower
consciousness (the "Seven circles of fire" of Pymander), that St. James
is made to say that "this Wisdom (*psuche* in the original) descended
not from above, but is earthly, sensual, *devilish*"; and *Psuche* is
*Manas,* the "human soul," the Spiritual Wisdom or Soul being *Buddhi.*
Yet Buddhi *per se,* being so near the Absolute, is only *latent*
consciousness.

\*\* This is the "undying race" as it is called in Esotericism, and
exoterically the fruitless generation of the first progeny of Daksha,
who curses Narada, the divine Rishi, alleged to have dissuaded the
Haryaswas and the Sabalaswas, the sons of Daksha, from procreating their
species, by saying "Be born in the womb; there shall not be a resting
place for thee in all these regions"; after this Narada, the
representative of that race of *fruitless* ascetics, is said, as soon as
he dies in one body, to be reborn in another.

the Fourth Race, so called. In the Vishnu Purana it is simply said that
Daksha, the father of mankind, established sexual intercourse as the
means of peopling the world.

Happily for the human race the "Elect Race" had already become the
vehicle of incarnation of the (intellectually and spiritually) highest
Dhyanis before Humanity had become quite material. When the last
sub-races -- save some lowest -- of the Third Race had perished with the
great Lemurian Continent, "the seeds of *the Trinity of Wisdom*" *had*
already acquired the secret of immortality on Earth, that gift which
allows the same great personality to step *ad libitum* from one worn-out
body into another.

(*b*) The first war that earth knew, the first human gore shed, was the
result of man's eyes and senses being opened; which made him see that
the daughters of his Brethren were fairer than his own, and their wives
also. There were rapes committed before that of the Sabines, and
Menelauses robbed of their Helens before the Fifth Race was born. Titans
or giants were the stronger; their adversaries, the wiser. This took
place during the Fourth Race -- that of the giants.

For "there *were* giants" in the days of old, indeed\* and the
evolutionary series of the animal world is a warrant that the same thing
took place within the human races. Lower still in the order of creation
we find witnesses for the same in the flora going *pari passu* with the
fauna in respect of size. The pretty ferns we collect and dry among the
leaves of our favourite volumes are the descendants of the gigantic
ferns which grew during the carboniferous period.

Scriptures, and fragments of philosophical and scientific works -- in
short, almost every record that has come down to us from antiquity --
contain references to giants. No one can fail to recognize the
Atlanteans of the Secret Doctrine in the Rakshasas of Lanka -- the
opponents conquered by Rama. Are these accounts no better than the
production of empty fancy? Let us give the subject a few moments of
attention.

\* The traditions of every country and nation point to this fact.
Donnelly quotes from Father Duran's *Historia Antigua de la Nueva
Espana* of 1885, in which a native of Cholula, a centenarian, accounts
for the building of the great pyramid of Cholula, by saying as follows:
"In the beginning, before the light of the Sun had been created, this
land (Cholula) was in obscurity and darkness . . . . but immediately
*after the light of* *the Sun arose in the East,* there appeared
gigantic men . . . . who built the said pyramid, its builders being
scattered after that to all parts of the Earth."

"A great deal of the Central American history is taken up with the
doings of an ancient race of giants called Quinanes," says the author of
"Atlantis" (p. 204.)
