THE LOTUS, AS A UNIVERSAL SYMBOL.</H4>

<P>
<STRONG>T</STRONG>HERE are no ancient symbols, without a deep
and philosophical meaning attached to them; their importance and
significance increasing with their antiquity. Such is the <STRONG>L</STRONG>OTUS.
It is the flower sacred to nature and her Gods, and represents
the abstract and the Concrete Universes, standing as the emblem
of the productive powers of both spiritual and physical nature.
It was held sacred from the remotest antiquity by the Aryan Hindus,
the Egyptians, and the Buddhists after them; revered in China
and Japan, and adopted as a Christian emblem by the Greek and
Latin Churches, who made of it a messenger as the Christians do
now, who replace it with the water lily.* It had, and still has,
its mystic meaning which is identical with every nation on the
earth. We refer the reader to Sir William Jones.** With the Hindus,
the lotus is the emblem of the productive power of nature, through
the agency of fire and water (spirit and matter). &quot;Eternal!&quot;
says a verse in the Bhagavad Gita, &quot;I see Brahm the creator
enthroned in thee above the lotus!&quot;; and Sir W. Jones shows,
as noted in the Stanzas, that the seeds of the lotus contain,
even before they germinate, perfectly-formed leaves, the miniature
shapes of what one day, as perfected plants, they will become.
The lotus, in India, is the symbol of prolific earth, and what
is more, of Mount Meru. The four angels or genii of the four quarters
of Heaven (the Maharajahs, see <EM>Stanzas</EM>)<EM> </EM>stand
each on a lotus. The lotus is the two-fold type of the Divine
and human hermaphrodite, being of dual sex, so to say.
<P>
The spirit of Fire (or Heat), which stirs up, fructifies, and
develops into concrete form everything (from its ideal prototype),
which is born of WATER or primordial Earth, evolved Brahma --
with the Hindus. The lotus flower, represented as growing out
of Vishnu's navel -- that God resting on the waters of space and
his Serpent of Infinity -- is the most graphic allegory ever made:
the Universe evolving from the central Sun, the POINT, the ever-concealed
germ. Lakshmi, who is the

<P>
* In the Christian religion Gabriel, the Archangel, holding in
his hand a spray of water lilies, appears to the Virgin Mary in
every picture of the Annunciation. This spray typifying fire and
water, or the idea of creation and generation, symbolizes <EM>precisely
the same idea as the lotus </EM>in the hand of the Bodhisat who
announces to Maha-Maya, Gautama's mother, the birth of the world's
Saviour, Buddha. Thus also, Osiris and Horus were represented
by the Egyptians constantly in association with the lotus-flower,
the two being Sun-gods or Fire (the Holy Ghost being still typified
by &quot;tongues of fire&quot;), (Acts).

female aspect of Vishnu,* and who is also called <EM>Padma</EM>,<EM>
</EM>the lotus, is likewise shown floating at &quot;Creation,&quot;
on a lotus flower, and during the &quot;churning of the ocean&quot;
of space, springing from the &quot;sea of milk,&quot; like Venus
from the froth.

<P>
sings an English Orientalist and poet (Sir Monier Williams).
<P>
The underlying idea in this symbol is very beautiful, and it shows,
furthermore, its identical parentage in all the religious systems.
Whether in the lotus or water-lily shape it signifies one and
the same philosophical idea -- namely, the emanation of the objective
from the subjective, divine Ideation passing from the abstract
into the concrete or visible form. For, as soon as <STRONG>D</STRONG>ARKNESS
-- or rather that which is &quot;darkness&quot; for ignorance
-- has disappeared in its own realm of eternal Light, leaving
behind itself only its divine manifested Ideation, the creative
Logoi have their understanding opened, and they see in the ideal
world (hitherto concealed in the divine thought) the archetypal
forms of all, and proceed to copy and build or fashion upon these
models forms evanescent and transcendent.
<P>
At this stage of action, the Demiurge** is not yet the Architect.
Born in the twilight of action, he has yet to first perceive the
plan, to realise the ideal forms which lie buried in the bosom
of Eternal Ideation, as the future lotus-leaves, the immaculate
petals, are concealed within the seed of that plant. . . . .
<P>
In chapter lxxxi. of the <EM>Ritual </EM>(<EM>Book of the Dead</EM>),<EM>
</EM>called &quot;Transformation into the Lotus,&quot; a head
emerging from this flower, the god exclaims: &quot;I am the pure
lotus, emerging from the Luminous one. . . . . I carry the messages
of Horus. I am the pure lotus which comes from the Solar Fields.
. . . .&quot;
<P>
The lotus-idea may be traced even in the Elohistic chapter, the
1st of <EM>Genesis</EM>,<EM> </EM>as stated in <EM>Isis.</EM>

<H6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
</H6>

<P>
* Lakshmi is Venus -- Aphrodite, and, like the latter, she sprang
from the froth of the ocean with a lotus in her hand. In the Ramayana
she is called Padma.
<P>
** In Esoteric philosophy the Demiurge or <EM>Logos</EM>,<EM>
</EM>regarded as the <STRONG>C</STRONG>REATOR, is simply an abstract
term, an idea, like &quot;army.&quot; As the latter is the all-embracing
term for a body of active forces or working units -- soldiers
-- so is the Demiurge the qualitative compound of a multitude
of Creators or Builders. Burnouf, the great Orientalist, has seized
the idea perfectly when saying that Brahma does <EM>not </EM>create
the earth, any more than the rest of the universe. &quot;Having
evolved himself from the soul of the world, once separated from
the first cause, he evaporates with, and emanates all nature out
of himself. He does not stand above it, but is mixed up with it;
Brahma and the universe form one Being, each particle of which
is in its essence Brahma himself, who proceeded out of himself.&quot;
<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 381 THE EXOTERIC AND THE ESOTERIC.</H6>

<P>
It is in this idea that we must look for the origin and explanation
of the verse in the Jewish cosmogony, which reads: &quot;And God
said, Let the earth bring forth . . . . the fruit-tree yielding
fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself.&quot; In all the
primitive religions, the &quot;Son of the Father&quot; is the
creative God -- <EM>i.e.</EM>,<EM> </EM>His thought made visible;
and before the Christian era, from the Trimurti of the Hindus
down to the three kabalistic heads of the scriptures as explained
by the Jews, the triune godhead of each nation was fully defined
and substantiated in its allegories.
<P>
Such is the cosmic and ideal significance of this great symbol
with the Eastern peoples. But, applied to practical and exoteric
worship -- which had also its esoteric symbology -- the lotus
became in time the carrier and container of a more terrestrial
idea. No dogmatic religion has ever escaped the sexual element
in it; and to this day it soils the moral beauty of the root idea.
The following is quoted from the same Kabalistic <B>MSS</B>. already
mentioned: --
<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;Pointing to like signification was the lotus growing in
the waters of the Nile. Its mode of growth peculiarly fitted it
as a symbol of the generative activities. The flower of the lotus,
which is the bearer of the seed for reproduction, as the result
of its maturing, is connected by its placenta-like attachment
with mother-earth, or the womb of Isis, through the water of the
womb, that is, the river Nile, by means of the long cord-like
stalk, the umbilicus. Nothing can be plainer than the symbol,
and to make it perfect in its intended signification, a child
is sometimes represented as seated in or issuing from the flower.*
Thus Osiris and Isis, the children of Chronos, or time without
end, in the development of their nature-forces, in this picture
become the parents of man under the name Horus. . .&quot; (See
&#167; X., &quot;Deus Lunus.&quot;)
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;We cannot lay too great stress upon the use of this generative
function as a basis for a symbolical language and a scientific
art-speech. Thought upon the idea leads at once to reflection
upon the subject of creative cause. In its workings Nature is
observed to have fashioned a wonderful piece of living mechanism
governed by an added living soul; the life development and history
of which soul, as to its whence, its present, and its whither,
surpasses all efforts of the human intellect.** The new born is
an ever-recurring miracle, an evidence that
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
* In Indian Puranas it is Vishnu, the first, and Brahma, the second
logos, or the ideal and practical creators, who are respectively
represented, one as manifesting the lotus, the other as issuing
from it.
<P>
** Not the &quot;efforts&quot; of the trained psychic faculties
of an Initiate into Eastern metaphysics, and the mysteries of
creative Nature. It is the profane of the past ages who have degraded
the pure ideal of cosmic creation into an emblem of mere human
reproduction and sexual functions: it is the esoteric teachings,
and the initiates of the Future, whose mission it is, and will
be, to redeem and ennoble once more the primitive conception so
sadly profaned by its crude and gross application to exoteric
dogmas and personations by theological and ecclesiastical religionists.
The silent worship of abstract or <EM>noumenal </EM>Nature, the
only divine manifestation, is the one ennobling religion of Humanity.
<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 382 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</H6>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
within the workshop of the womb an intelligent creative power
has intervened to fasten a living soul to a physical machine.
The amazing wonderfulness of the fact attaches a holy sacredness
to all connected with the organs of reproduction, as the dwelling
and place of evident constructive intervention of deity.&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
This is a correct rendering of the underlying ideas of old, of
the purely pantheistic conceptions, <EM>impersonal </EM>and reverential,
of the archaic philosophers of the prehistoric ages. Not so, however,
when applied to sinful humanity, to the gross ideas attached to
personality. Therefore, no pantheistic philosopher would fail
to find the remarks that follow the above and which represent
the anthropomorphism of Judean symbology, other than dangerous
for the sacredness of true religion, and fitting only our materialistic
age, which is the direct outcome and result of that anthropomorphic
character. For this is the key-note to the entire spirit and essence
of the Old Testament. &quot;Therefore,&quot; goes on the MSS.,
treating of the symbolism of art-speech of the Bible: --
<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;The locality of the <I>womb </I>is to be taken as the MOST
HOLY PLACE, the SANCTUM SANCTORUM, and the <I>veritable </I><STRONG>T</STRONG>EMPLE
OF THE <STRONG>L</STRONG>IVING <STRONG>G</STRONG>OD.* With man
the possession of the woman has always been considered as an essential
part of himself, to make one out of two, and jealously guarded
as sacred. Even the part of the ordinary house or home consecrated
to the dwelling of the wife was called the<I> penetralia</I>,<I>
</I>the secret or sacred, and hence the metaphor of the Holy of
Holies of sacred constructions taken from the idea of the sacredness
of the organs of generation. Carried to the extreme of description**
by metaphor, this part of the house is described in the Sacred
Books as the &quot;between the thighs of the house,&quot; and
sometimes the idea is carried out constructively in the great
door-opening of Churches placed inward between flanking buttresses.&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
No such thought &quot;carried to the extreme&quot; ever existed
among the old primitive Aryans. This is proven by the fact that
in the Vedic period their women were not placed apart from men
in <EM>penetralia</EM>,<EM> </EM>or<EM> </EM>&quot;Zenanas.&quot;
Their seclusion began when the Mahomedans -- the next heirs to
Hebrew symbolism after Christian ecclesiasticism -- had conquered
the land and gradually enforced their ways and customs upon the
Hindus. The pre- and <EM>post-</EM>Vedic woman was as free as
man; and no impure terrestrial thought was ever mixed with the
religious symbo-
<H6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
</H6>

<P>
* Surely the words of the old Initiate into the <EM>primitive</EM>
mysteries of Christianity, &quot;<EM>Know ye not ye are the Temple
of God</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>(I<EM> </EM>Corinth. <EM>iii</EM>.
16) could not be applied in <EM>this </EM>sense to <EM>men?</EM>
The meaning may have been, and <EM>was </EM>so, undeniably, in
the minds of the Hebrew compilers of the <EM>Old</EM> Testament.
And here is the abyss that lies between the symbolism of the New
Testament and the Jewish canon. This gulf would have remained
and ever widened, had not Christianity -- especially and most
glaringly the Latin Church -- thrown a bridge over it? Modern
Popery has now spanned it entirely, by its dogma of the two immaculate
conceptions, and the anthropomorphic and at the same time idolatrous
character it has conferred upon the Mother of its God.
<P>
** It was so carried <EM>only</EM> in the Hebrew Bible, and its
servile copyist, Christian theology.<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 383 THE PURITY OF EARLY PHALLICISM.</H6>

<P>
logy of the early Aryans. The idea and application are purely
Semitic. This is corroborated by the writer of the said intensely
learned and Kabalistic revelation himself, when he closes the
above-quoted passages by adding: --
<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;If to these organs as symbols of creative cosmic agencies
the idea of the origin of measures as well as of time-periods
can be attached, then indeed, in the constructions of the Temples
as Dwellings of Deity, or of Jehovah, that part designated as
the Holy of Holies, or the Most Holy place, should borrow its
title from the recognised sacredness of the generative organs,
considered as symbols of measures as well as of creative cause.
With the ancient WISE, <I>there was no name and no idea</I>,<I>
and no symbol </I>of A FIRST CAUSE.&quot; . . . .
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Most decidedly not. Rather never give a thought to it and leave
it for ever <EM>nameless</EM>,<EM> </EM>as the early Pantheists
did, than degrade the sacredness of that <EM>Ideal of Ideals</EM>,<EM>
</EM>by dragging down its symbols into such anthropomorphic forms!
Here again one perceives the immense chasm between Aryan and Semitic
religious thought: two opposite poles -- Sincerity and Concealment.
With the Brahmins, who have never invested with an &quot;original
Sin&quot; element the natural procreative functions of mankind,
it is a <EM>religious duty</EM> to have a son. A Brahmin, in days
of old, having accomplished his mission of human creator, retired
to the jungle and passed the rest of his days in religious meditations.
He had accomplished his duty to nature as mortal man and its co-worker,
and henceforth gave all his thoughts to the spiritual immortal
portion in himself, regarding the terrestrial as a mere illusion,
an evanescent dream -- which it is. With the Semite, it was different.
He invented a temptation of flesh in a garden of Eden; showed
his God (esoterically, the Tempter and the Ruler of Nature) CURSING
<EM>for ever </EM>an act, which was in the logical programme of
that nature.* All this exoterically, as in the <EM>cloak </EM>and
dead letter of Genesis and the rest; and at the same time <EM>esoterically
</EM>he regarded the supposed <EM>sin </EM>and FALL as an act
so sacred, as to choose the organ, the perpetrator of the <EM>original
sin</EM>,<EM> </EM>as the fittest and most sacred symbol to represent
that God, who is shown as branding its entering into function
as disobedience and everlasting SIN!
<P>
Who can ever fathom the paradoxical depths of the Semitic mind?
And this paradoxical element, <EM>minus </EM>its innermost significance,
has now passed entirely into Christian theology and dogma!
<P>
Whether the early Fathers of the Church knew the esoteric meaning
of the Hebrew (Old) Testament, or whether only a few of them were
aware of it, while the others remained ignorant of the secret,
is for
<H6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
</H6>

<P>
* The same idea is carried out exoterically in the incidents of
Egypt. The Lord God tempts sorely Pharaoh and &quot;plagues him
with great plagues,&quot; lest the king should escape punishment,
and thus afford no pretext for one more triumph to his &quot;Chosen
people.&quot;<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 384 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</H6>

<P>
posterity to decide. One thing is certain, at any rate. As the
esotericism of the New Testament agrees perfectly with that of
the Hebrew Mosaic Books; and since, at the same time, a number
of purely Egyptian symbols and pagan dogmas in general -- the
Trinity for example -- have been copied by, and incorporated into,
the Synoptics and St. John, it becomes evident that the identity
of those symbols was known to the writers of the New Testament,
whoever they were. They must have been aware also of the priority
of the Egyptian esotericism, since they have adopted several such
symbols that typify purely Egyptian conceptions and beliefs --
in their outward and inward meaning -- and which are not to be
found in the Jewish Canon. One of such is the water-lily in the
hands of the Archangel in the early representations of his appearance
to the Virgin Mary; and these symbolical images are preserved
to this day in the iconography of the Greek and Roman Churches.
Thus water, fire, the Cross, as well as the Dove, the Lamb, and
other sacred animals, with all their combinations, yield esoterically
an identical meaning, and must have been accepted as an improvement
upon Judaism pure and simple.
<P>
For the Lotus and Water are among the oldest symbols, and in their
origin are purely Aryan, though they became common property during
the branching-off of the fifth race. Let us give an example. Letters,
as much as numbers, were all mystic, whether in combination or
each taken separately. The most sacred of all is the letter M.
It is both feminine and masculine, or androgyne, and is made to
symbolize WATER, the great deep, in its origin. It is mystic in
all the languages, Eastern and Western, and stands as a glyph
for the waves, thus: <IMG SRC="sd1-384.gif" ALIGN="MIDDLE">. In
the Aryan Esotericism, as in the Semitic, this letter has always
stood for the waters; <EM>e.g</EM>., in Sanskrit MAKARA -- the
tenth sign of the Zodiac -- means a crocodile, or rather an aquatic
monster associated always with water. The letter MA is equivalent
to and corresponds with number 5 -- composed of a <EM>binary</EM>,<EM>
</EM>the symbol of the two sexes separated, and of the <EM>ternary</EM>,<EM>
</EM>symbol of the third life, the progeny of the <EM>binary.
</EM>This, again, is often symbolised by a <EM>Pentagon</EM>,<EM>
</EM>the latter being a sacred sign, a divine Monogram. <STRONG>M</STRONG>AITREYA
is the secret name of the <EM>Fifth </EM>Buddha, and the <EM>Kalki
</EM>Avatar of the Brahmins -- the last <STRONG>M</STRONG>ESSIAH
who will come at the culmination of the Great Cycle. It is also
the initial letter of the Greek Metis or <EM>Divine Wisdom</EM>;
of<EM> Mimra</EM>,<EM> </EM>the &quot;word&quot; or <EM>Logos</EM>;
and of <EM>Mithras </EM>(the<EM> Mihr</EM>),<EM> </EM>the<EM>
Monad</EM>,<EM> Mystery. </EM>All these are born in, and from,
the great Deep, and are the Sons of <EM>Maya</EM> -- the <EM>Mother;
</EM>in Egypt, <EM>Mouth</EM>,<EM> </EM>in Greece <EM>Minerva
</EM>(divine wisdom), <EM>Mary</EM>,<EM> </EM>or<EM> Miriam</EM>,<EM>
Myrrha</EM>,<EM> </EM>etc.; of the Mother of the Christian Logos,
and of <EM>Maya</EM>,<EM> </EM>the mother of Buddha. <EM>Madhava
</EM>and<EM> Madhavi </EM>are the titles of the most important
gods and goddesses of the Hindu Pantheon. Finally, <EM>Mandala
</EM>is in<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 385 THE EGYPTIAN LOTUS.</H6>

<P>
Sanskrit &quot;a circle,&quot; or an orb (the ten divisions of
the <EM>Rig Veda</EM>)<EM>. </EM>The most sacred names in India
begin with this letter generally -- from <EM>Mahat</EM>,<EM> </EM>the
first manifested intellect, and <EM>Mandara</EM>,<EM> </EM>the
great mountain used by the gods to churn the <EM>Ocean</EM>,<EM>
</EM>down to <EM>Mandakin</EM>,<EM> </EM>the heavenly <EM>Ganga
</EM>(Ganges),<EM> Manu</EM>,<EM> </EM>etc., etc.
<P>
Shall this be called a coincidence? A strange one it is then,
indeed, when we find even Moses -- found in the water of the Nile
-- having the symbolical consonant in his name. And Pharaoh's
daughter &quot;called his name Moses . . . because,&quot; she
said, &quot;<EM>I drew him out of </EM><STRONG>W</STRONG>ATER&quot;
(<EM>Exod. ii.</EM>,<EM> </EM>10.)* Besides which the Hebrew sacred
name of God <EM>applied to this letter M </EM>is<EM> Meborach</EM>,<EM>
</EM>the &quot;Holy&quot; or the &quot;Blessed,&quot; and the
name for the water of the <EM>Flood </EM>is<EM> M</EM>'<EM>bul.
</EM>A reminder of the &quot;<EM>three</EM> Maries&quot; at the
Crucifixion and their connection with <EM>Mar</EM>,<EM> </EM>the
Sea, or <EM>Water</EM>,<EM> </EM>may close this example. This
is why in Judaism and Christianity the <EM>Messiah </EM>is always
connected with Water, Baptism, the <EM>Fishes </EM>(the sign of
the Zodiac called <EM>Meenam </EM>in Sanskrit), and even with
the <EM>Matsya </EM>(fish) Avatar, and the Lotus -- the symbol
of the womb, or the water-lily, which is the same.
<P>
In the relics of ancient Egypt, the greater the antiquity of the
votive symbols and emblems of the objects exhumed, the oftener
are the lotus flowers and the water found in connection with the
Solar Gods. The god <EM>Khnoom</EM> --<EM> </EM>the moist power
-- water, as Thales taught it, being the principle of all things,
sits on a throne enshrined in a lotus (Saitic epoch, <EM>Serapeum</EM>)<EM>.
</EM>The god Bes stands on a lotus, ready to devour his progeny.
(<EM>Ibid</EM>, Abydos.) Thot, the god of mystery and Wisdom,
the sacred Scribe of Amenti, wearing the Solar disc as head gear,
sits with a bull's head (the sacred bull of Mendes being a form
of Thot) and a human body, on a full blown lotus. (<EM>IVth Dynasty.</EM>)<EM>
</EM>Finally it is the goddess <EM>Hiquet</EM>,<EM> </EM>under
her shape of a frog, who rests on the lotus, thus showing her
connection with water. And it is this frog-symbol, undeniably
the most ancient of their Egyptian deities, from whose unpoetical
shape the Egyptologists have been vainly trying to unravel her
mystery and functions. Its adoption in the Church by the early
Christians shows that they knew it better than our modern Orientalists.
The &quot;frog or toad goddess&quot; was one of the chief cosmic
deities connected with creation, on account of her amphibious
nature, and chiefly because of her apparent resurrection, after
long ages of solitary life enshrined in old walls, in rocks, etc.
She not only participated in the organization of the world, together
with <EM>Khnoom</EM>,<EM> </EM>but was also connected with <EM>the</EM>

some very profound and sacred meaning attached to this symbol,
since, notwithstanding the risk of being charged with a disgusting
form of zoolatry, the early Egyptian Christians adopted it in
their Churches. A frog or toad enshrined in a lotus flower, or
simply without the latter emblem, was the form chosen <EM>for
the Church lamps</EM>,<EM> </EM>on which were engraved the words
&quot;I am the resurrection&quot; &quot;[[<EM>ego eimi anastasis</EM>]].&quot;**
These frog goddesses are also found on all the mummies.
