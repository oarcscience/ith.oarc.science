#### COMMENTARIES

ON THE SEVEN STANZAS AND THEIR TERMS, ACCORDING TO THEIR  
NUMERATION, IN STANZAS AND SLOKAS.

#### STANZA I.

1\. "**T**HE **E**TERNAL **P**ARENT (Space), WRAPPED IN HER EVER
INVISIBLE ROBES, HAD SLUMBERED ONCE AGAIN FOR SEVEN ETERNITIES (*a*)."

The "Parent Space" is the eternal, ever present cause of all -- the
incomprehensible DEITY, whose "invisible robes" are the mystic root of
all matter, and of the Universe. Space is the *one eternal thing* that
we can most easily imagine, immovable in its abstraction and
uninfluenced by either the presence or absence in it of an objective
Universe. It is without dimension, in every sense, and self-existent.
Spirit is the first differentiation from **T**HAT, the causeless cause
of both Spirit and Matter. It is, as taught in the esoteric catechism,
neither limitless void, nor conditioned fulness, but both. It was and
ever will be. (See Proem pp. 2 *et seq.*)

Thus, the "Robes" stand for the noumenon of undifferentiated Cosmic
Matter. It is not matter as we know it, but the spiritual essence of
matter, and is co-eternal and even one with Space in its abstract sense.
Root-nature is also the source of the subtile invisible properties in
visible matter. It is the Soul, so to say, of the ONE infinite Spirit.
The Hindus call it Mulaprakriti, and say that it is the primordial
substance, which is the basis of the Upadhi or vehicle of every
phenomenon, whether physical, mental or psychic. It is the source from
which Akasa radiates.

(*a*) By the Seven "Eternities," aeons or periods are meant. The word
"Eternity," as understood in Christian theology, has no meaning to the
Asiatic ear, except in its application to the ONE existence; nor is

------------------------------------------------------------------------

###### \[\[Vol. 1, Page\]\] 36 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.

the term sempiternity, the eternal only in futurity, anything better
than a misnomer.\* Such words do not and cannot exist in philosophical
metaphysics, and were unknown till the advent of ecclesiastical
Christianity. The Seven Eternities meant are the seven periods, or a
period answering in its duration to the seven periods, of a Manvantara,
and extending throughout a Maha-Kalpa or the "Great Age" -- 100 years of
Brahma -- making a total of 311,040,000,000,000 of years; each year of
Brahma being composed of 360 "days," and of the same number of "nights"
of Brahma (reckoning by the Chandrayana or lunar year); and a "Day of
Brahma" consisting of 4,320,000,000 of mortal years. These "Eternities"
belong to the most secret calculations, in which, in order to arrive at
the true total, every figure must be 7*x* (7 to the power of *x*); *x*
varying according to the nature of the cycle in the subjective or real
world; and every figure or number relating to, or representing all the
different cycles from the greatest to the smallest -- in the objective
or unreal world -- must necessarily be multiples of seven. The key to
this cannot be given, for herein lies the mystery of esoteric
calculations, and for the purposes of ordinary calculation it has no
sense. "The number seven," says the Kabala, "is the great number of the
Divine Mysteries;" number ten is that of all human knowledge
(Pythagorean decade); 1,000 is the number ten to the third power, and
therefore the number 7,000 is also symbolical. In the Secret Doctrine
the figure and number 4 are the male symbol only on the highest plane of
abstraction; on the plane of matter the 3 is the masculine and the 4 the
female: the upright and the horizontal in the fourth stage of symbolism,
when the symbols became the glyphs of the generative powers on the
physical plane.

2\. **T**IME WAS NOT, FOR IT LAY ASLEEP IN THE INFINITE BOSOM OF
DURATION (*a*).

###### \[\[Footnote(s)\]\] -------------------------------------------------

\* It is stated in Book II., ch. viii., of Vishnu Purana: "By
immortality is meant existence to the end of the Kalpa;" and Wilson, the
translator, remarks in a footnote: "This, according to the Vedas, is all
that is to be understood of the immortality (or eternity) of the gods;
they perish at the end of universal dissolution (or Pralaya)." And
Esoteric philosophy says: They "perish" not, but are *re-absorbed.*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

###### \[\[Vol. 1, Page\]\] 37 TIME AND UNIVERSAL MIND.

(*a*) Time is only an illusion produced by the succession of our states
of consciousness as we travel through eternal duration, and it does not
exist where no consciousness exists in which the illusion can be
produced; but "lies asleep." The present is only a mathematical line
which divides that part of eternal duration which we call the future,
from that part which we call the past. Nothing on earth has real
duration, for nothing remains without change -- or the same -- for the
billionth part of a second; and the sensation we have of the actuality
of the division of "time" known as the present, comes from the blurring
of that momentary glimpse, or succession of glimpses, of things that our
senses give us, as those things pass from the region of ideals which we
call the future, to the region of memories that we name the past. In the
same way we experience a sensation of duration in the case of the
instantaneous electric spark, by reason of the blurred and continuing
impression on the retina. The real person or thing does not consist
solely of what is seen at any particular moment, but is composed of the
sum of all its various and changing conditions from its appearance in
the material form to its disappearance from the earth. It is these
"sum-totals" that exist from eternity in the "future," and pass by
degrees through matter, to exist for eternity in the "past." No one
could say that a bar of metal dropped into the sea came into existence
as it left the air, and ceased to exist as it entered the water, and
that the bar itself consisted only of that cross-section thereof which
at any given moment coincided with the mathematical plane that
separates, and, at the same time, joins, the atmosphere and the ocean.
Even so of persons and things, which, dropping out of the to-be into the
has-been, out of the future into the past -- present momentarily to our
senses a cross-section, as it were, of their total selves, as they pass
through time and space (as matter) on their way from one eternity to
another: and these two constitute that "duration" in which alone
anything has true existence, were our senses but able to cognize it
there.

3\. *. .* . **U**NIVERSAL MIND WAS NOT, FOR THERE WERE NO **A**H-HI
(celestial beings) TO CONTAIN (hence to manifest) IT (*a*)*.*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

###### \[\[Vol. 1, Page\]\] 38 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.

(*a*) Mind is a name given to the sum of the states of Consciousness
grouped under Thought, Will, and Feeling. During deep sleep, ideation
ceases on the physical plane, and memory is in abeyance; thus for the
time-being "Mind is not," because the organ, through which the Ego
manifests ideation and memory on the material plane, has temporarily
ceased to function. A noumenon can become a phenomenon on any plane of
existence only by manifesting on that plane through an appropriate basis
or vehicle; and during the long night of rest called Pralaya, when all
the existences are dissolved, the "**U**NIVERSAL **M**IND" remains as a
permanent possibility of mental action, or as that abstract absolute
thought, of which mind is the concrete relative manifestation. The
**A**H-HI (Dhyan-Chohans) are the collective hosts of spiritual beings
-- the Angelic Hosts of Christianity, the Elohim and "Messengers" of the
Jews -- who are the vehicle for the manifestation of the divine or
universal thought and will. They are the Intelligent Forces that give to
and enact in Nature her "laws," while themselves acting according to
laws imposed upon them in a similar manner by still higher Powers; but
they are not "the personifications" of the powers of Nature, as
erroneously thought. This hierarchy of spiritual Beings, through which
the Universal Mind comes into action, is like an army -- a "Host," truly
-- by means of which the fighting power of a nation manifests itself,
and which is composed of army corps, divisions, brigades, regiments, and
so forth, each with its separate individuality or life, and its limited
freedom of action and limited responsibilities; each contained in a
larger individuality, to which its own interests are subservient, and
each containing lesser individualities in itself.

4\. **T**HE SEVEN WAYS TO BLISS (Moksha\* or Nirvana) WERE NOT (*a*)*.*
**T**HE GREAT CAUSES OF MISERY (Nidana\*\* and Maya) WERE NOT, FOR THERE
WAS NO ONE TO PRODUCE AND GET ENSNARED BY THEM (*b*).

ence, which is absolute Being, Existence, and Consciousness. They were
not, because the Universe was, so far, empty, and existed only in the
Divine Thought. For it is . . .

(*b*) The twelve Nidanas or causes of being. Each is the effect of its
antecedent cause, and a cause, in its turn, to its successor; the sum
total of the Nidanas being based on the four truths, a doctrine
especially characteristic of the Hinayana System.\* They belong to the
theory of the stream of catenated law which produces merit and demerit,
and finally brings Karma into full sway. It is based upon the great
truth that re-incarnation is to be dreaded, as existence in this world
only entails upon man suffering, misery and pain; Death itself being
unable to deliver man from it, since death is merely the door through
which he passes to another life on earth after a little rest on its
threshold -- Devachan. The Hinayana System, or School of the "Little
Vehicle," is of very ancient growth; while the Mahayana is of a later
period, having originated after the death of Buddha. Yet the tenets of
the latter are as old as the hills that have contained such schools from
time immemorial, and the Hinayana and Mahayana Schools (the latter, that
of the "Great Vehicle") both teach the same doctrine in reality. *Yana,*
or Vehicle (in Sanskrit, Vahan) is a mystic expression, both "vehicles"
inculcating that man may escape the sufferings of rebirths and even the
false bliss of Devachan, by obtaining Wisdom and Knowledge, which alone
can dispel the Fruits of Illusion and Ignorance.

Maya or illusion is an element which enters into all finite things, for
everything that exists has only a relative, not an absolute, reality,
since the appearance which the hidden noumenon assumes for any observer
depends upon his power of cognition. To the untrained eye of the savage,
a painting is at first an unmeaning confusion of streaks and daubs of
color, while an educated eye sees instantly a face or a landscape.
Nothing is permanent except the one hidden absolute existence which
contains in itself the noumena of all realities. The existences
belonging to every plane of being, up to the highest Dhyan-Chohans, are,
in degree, of the nature of shadows cast by a magic lantern on a
colourless screen; but all things are relatively real, for the cogniser
is also a reflection, and the things cognised are therefore as real to
him as himself. Whatever reality things possess must be looked for in
them

before or after they have passed like a flash through the material
world; but we cannot cognise any such existence directly, so long as we
have sense-instruments which bring only material existence into the
field of our consciousness. Whatever plane our consciousness may be
acting in, both we and the things belonging to that plane are, for the
time being, our only realities. As we rise in the scale of development
we perceive that during the stages through which we have passed we
mistook shadows for realities, and the upward progress of the Ego is a
series of progressive awakenings, each advance bringing with it the idea
that now, at last, we have reached "reality;" but only when we shall
have reached the absolute Consciousness, and blended our own with it,
shall we be free from the delusions produced by Maya.

5\. **D**ARKNESS ALONE FILLED THE BOUNDLESS ALL (*a*), FOR FATHER,
MOTHER AND SON WERE ONCE MORE ONE, AND THE SON HAD NOT AWAKENED YET FOR
THE NEW WHEEL\* AND HIS PILGRIMAGE THEREON (*b*).

(*a*) "Darkness is Father-Mother: light their son," says an old Eastern
proverb. Light is inconceivable except as coming from some source which
is the cause of it; and as, in the instance of primordial light, that
source is unknown, though as strongly demanded by reason and logic,
therefore it is called "Darkness" by us, from an intellectual point of
view. As to borrowed or secondary light, whatever its source, it can be
but of a temporary mayavic character. Darkness, then, is the eternal

###### \[\[Footnote(s)\]\] -------------------------------------------------

\* That which is called "wheel" is the symbolical expression for a world
or globe, which shows that the ancients were aware that our Earth was a
revolving globe, not a motionless square as some Christian Fathers
taught. The "Great Wheel" is the whole duration of our Cycle of being,
or Maha Kalpa, *i.e.*, the whole revolution of our special chain of
seven planets or Spheres from beginning to end; the "Small Wheels"
meaning the Rounds, of which there are also Seven.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

###### \[\[Vol. 1, Page\]\] 41 WHAT IS DARKNESS IN PHILOSOPHY?

matrix in which the sources of light appear and disappear. Nothing is
added to darkness to make of it light, or to light to make it darkness,
on this our plane. They are interchangeable, and scientifically light is
but a mode of darkness and *vice versa.* Yet both are phenomena of the
same noumenon -- which is absolute darkness to the scientific mind, and
but a gray twilight to the perception of the average mystic, though to
that of the spiritual eye of the Initiate it is absolute light. How far
we discern the light that shines in darkness depends upon our powers of
vision. What is light to us is darkness to certain insects, and the eye
of the clairvoyant sees illumination where the normal eye perceives only
blackness. When the whole universe was plunged in sleep -- had returned
to its one primordial element -- there was neither centre of luminosity,
nor eye to perceive light, and darkness necessarily filled the boundless
all.

(*b*) The Father-Mother are the male and female principles in
root-nature, the opposite poles that manifest in all things on every
plane of Kosmos, or Spirit and Substance, in a less allegorical aspect,
the resultant of which is the Universe, or the Son. They are "once more
One" when in "The Night of Brahma," during Pralaya, all in the objective
Universe has returned to its one primal and eternal cause, to reappear
at the following Dawn -- as it does periodically. "Karana" -- eternal
cause -- was alone. To put it more plainly: Karana is alone during the
"Nights of Brahma." The previous objective Universe has dissolved into
its one primal and eternal cause, and is, so to say, held in solution in
space, to differentiate again and crystallize out anew at the following
Manvantaric dawn, which is the commencement of a new "Day" or new
activity of Brahma -- the symbol of the Universe. In esoteric parlance,
Brahma is Father-Mother-Son, or Spirit, Soul and Body at once; each
personage being symbolical of an attribute, and each attribute or
quality being a graduated efflux of Divine Breath in its cyclic
differentiation, involutionary and evolutionary. In the cosmicophysical
sense, it is the Universe, the planetary chain and the earth; in the
purely spiritual, the Unknown Deity, Planetary Spirit, and Man -- the
Son of the two, the creature of Spirit and Matter, and a manifestation
of them in his periodical appearances on Earth during the "wheels," or
the Manvantaras. -- (*See* Part II. §: "*Days and Nights of Brahma.*")

6\. **T**HE SEVEN SUBLIME **L**ORDS AND THE SEVEN **T**RUTHS HAD CEASED
TO BE (*a*), AND THE **U**NIVERSE, THE SON OF NECESSITY, WAS IMMERSED IN
**P**ARANISHPANNA (*b*) (absolute perfection, Paranirvana, which is
Yong-Grub) TO BE OUT-BREATHED BY THAT WHICH IS AND YET IS NOT.
**N**AUGHT WAS (*c*).

(*a*) The seven sublime lords are the Seven Creative Spirits, the
Dhyan-Chohans, who correspond to the Hebrew Elohim. It is the same
hierarchy of Archangels to which St. Michael, St. Gabriel, and others
belong, in the Christian theogony. Only while St. Michael, for instance,
is allowed in dogmatic Latin theology to watch over all the promontories
and gulfs, in the Esoteric System, the Dhyanis watch successively over
one of the Rounds and the great Root-races of our planetary chain. They
are, moreover, said to send their Bhodisatvas, the human correspondents
of the Dhyani-Buddhas (of whom *vide infra*) during every Round and
Race. Out of the Seven Truths and Revelations, or rather revealed
secrets, four only have been handed to us, as we are still in the Fourth
Round, and the world also has only had four Buddhas, so far. This is a
very complicated question, and will receive more ample treatment later
on.

So far "There are only Four Truths, and Four Vedas" -- say the Hindus
and Buddhists. For a similar reason Irenaeus insisted on the necessity
of Four Gospels. But as every new Root-race at the head of a Round must
have its revelation and revealers, the next Round will bring the Fifth,
the following the Sixth, and so on.

(*b*) "*Paranishpanna*" is the absolute perfection to which all
existences attain at the close of a great period of activity, or
Maha-Manvantara, and in which they rest during the succeeding period of
repose. In Tibetan it is called Yong-Grub. Up to the day of the
Yogacharya school the true nature of Paranirvana was taught publicly,
but since then it has become entirely esoteric; hence so many
contradictory interpretations of it. It is only a true Idealist who can
understand it. Everything has to be viewed as ideal, with the exception
of Paranirvana, by him who would comprehend that state, and acquire a
knowledge of how Non Ego, Voidness, and Darkness are Three in One and
alone Self-existent and perfect. It is absolute, however, only in a
relative

sense, for it must give room to still further absolute perfection,
according to a higher standard of excellence in the following period of
activity -- just as a perfect flower must cease to be a perfect flower
and die, in order to grow into a perfect fruit, -- if a somewhat Irish
mode of expression may be permitted.

The Secret Doctrine teaches the progressive development of everything,
worlds as well as atoms; and this stupendous development has neither
conceivable beginning nor imaginable end. Our "Universe" is only one of
an infinite number of Universes, all of them "Sons of Necessity,"
because links in the great Cosmic chain of Universes, each one standing
in the relation of an effect as regards its predecessor, and being a
cause as regards its successor.

The appearance and disappearance of the Universe are pictured as an
outbreathing and inbreathing of "the Great Breath," which is eternal,
and which, being Motion, is one of the three aspects of the Absolute --
Abstract Space and Duration being the other two. When the "Great Breath"
is projected, it is called the Divine Breath, and is regarded as the
breathing of the Unknowable Deity -- the One Existence -- which breathes
out a thought, as it were, which becomes the Kosmos. (See "Isis
Unveiled.") So also is it when the Divine Breath is inspired again the
Universe disappears into the bosom of "the Great Mother," who then
sleeps "wrapped in her invisible robes."

(*c*) By "that which is and yet is not" is meant the Great Breath
itself, which we can only speak of as absolute existence, but cannot
picture to our imagination as any form of existence that we can
distinguish from Non-existence. The three periods -- the Present, the
Past, and the Future -- are in the esoteric philosophy a compound time;
for the three are a composite number only in relation to the phenomenal
plane, but in the realm of noumena have no abstract validity. As said in
the Scriptures: "The Past time is the Present time, as also the Future,
which, though it has not come into existence, still is"; according to a
precept in the Prasanga Madhyamika teaching, whose dogmas have been
known ever since it broke away from the purely esoteric schools.\* Our
ideas, in short, on duration and time are all derived from our

sensations according to the laws of Association. Inextricably bound up
with the relativity of human knowledge, they nevertheless can have no
existence except in the experience of the individual ego, and perish
when its evolutionary march dispels the Maya of phenomenal existence.
What is Time, for instance, but the panoramic succession of our states
of consciousness? In the words of a Master, "I feel irritated at having
to use these three clumsy words -- Past, Present, and Future --
miserable concepts of the objective phases of the subjective whole, they
are about as ill-adapted for the purpose as an axe for fine carving."
One has to acquire *Paramartha* lest one should become too easy a prey
to *Samvriti* -- is a philosophical axiom.\*

#### STANZA I. -- *Continued*.

7\. **T**HE CAUSES OF EXISTENCE HAD BEEN DONE AWAY WITH (*a*); THE
VISIBLE THAT WAS, AND THE INVISIBLE THAT IS, RESTED IN ETERNAL
NON-BEING, THE ONE BEING (*b*).

(*a*) "The Causes of Existence" mean not only the physical causes known
to science, but the metaphysical causes, the chief of which is the
desire to exist, an outcome of Nidana and Maya. This desire for a
sentient life shows itself in everything, from an atom to a sun, and is
a reflection of the Divine Thought propelled into objective existence,
into a law that the Universe should exist. According to esoteric
teaching, the real cause of that supposed desire, and of all existence,
remains for ever hidden, and its first emanations are the most complete
abstractions mind can conceive. These abstractions must of necessity be
postulated as the cause of the material Universe which presents itself
to the senses and intellect; and they underlie the secondary and
subordinate powers of Nature, which, anthropomorphized, have been
worshipped as God and gods by the common herd of every age. It is
impossible to conceive anything without a cause; the attempt to do so
makes the mind a blank.

###### \[\[Footnote(s)\]\] -------------------------------------------------

\* In clearer words: "One has to acquire true Self-Consciousness in
order to understand *Samvriti,* or the 'origin of delusion.'"
*Paramartha* is the synonym of the Sanskrit term *Svasam-vedana,* or
"the reflection which analyses itself." There is a difference in the
interpretation of the meaning of "*Paramartha*" between the Yogacharyas
and the Madhyamikas, neither of whom, however, explain the real and true
esoteric sense of the expression. See further, sloka No. 9.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

###### \[\[Vol. 1, Page\]\] 45 BEING AND NON-BEING.

This is virtually the condition to which the mind must come at last when
we try to trace back the chain of causes and effects, but both science
and religion jump to this condition of blankness much more quickly than
is necessary; for they ignore the metaphysical abstractions which are
the only conceivable cause of physical concretions. These abstractions
become more and more concrete as they approach our plane of existence,
until finally they phenomenalise in the form of the material Universe,
by a process of conversion of metaphysics into physics, analogous to
that by which steam can be condensed into water, and the water frozen
into ice.

(*b*) The idea of Eternal Non-Being, which is the One Being, will appear
a paradox to anyone who does not remember that we limit our ideas of
being to our present consciousness of existence; making it a specific,
instead of a generic term. An unborn infant, could it think in our
acceptation of that term, would necessarily limit its conception of
being, in a similar manner, to the intrauterine life which alone it
knows; and were it to endeavour to express to its consciousness the idea
of life after birth (death to it), it would, in the absence of data to
go upon, and of faculties to comprehend such data, probably express that
life as "Non-Being which is Real Being." In our case the One Being is
the noumenon of all the noumena which we know must underlie phenomena,
and give them whatever shadow of reality they possess, but which we have
not the senses or the intellect to cognize at present. The impalpable
atoms of gold scattered through the substance of a ton of auriferous
quartz may be imperceptible to the naked eye of the miner, yet he knows
that they are not only present there but that they alone give his quartz
any appreciable value; and this relation of the gold to the quartz may
faintly shadow forth that of the noumenon to the phenomenon. But the
miner knows what the gold will look like when extracted from the quartz,
whereas the common mortal can form no conception of the reality of
things separated from the Maya which veils them, and in which they are
hidden. Alone the Initiate, rich with the lore acquired by numberless
generations of his predecessors, directs the "Eye of Dangma" toward the
essence of things in which no Maya can have any influence. It is here
that the teachings of esoteric philosophy in relation to the Nidanas and
the Four Truths become of the greatest importance; but they are secret.

8\. **A**LONE, THE ONE FORM OF EXISTENCE STRETCHED BOUNDLESS, INFINITE,
CAUSELESS, IN DREAMLESS SLEEP (*a*); AND LIFE PULSATED UNCONSCIOUS IN
UNIVERSAL SPACE, THROUGHOUT THAT **A**LL-**P**RESENCE WHICH IS SENSED BY
THE "**O**PENED **E**YE"\* OF THE **D**ANGMA (*b*).\*\*

(*a*) The tendency of modern thought is to recur to the archaic idea of
a homogeneous basis for apparently widely different things --
heterogeneity developed from homogeneity. Biologists are now searching
for their homogeneous protoplasm and chemists for their protyle, while
science is looking for the force of which electricity, magnetism, heat,
and so forth, are the differentiations. The Secret Doctrine carries this
idea into the region of metaphysics and postulates a "One Form of
Existence" as the basis and source of all things. But perhaps the
phrase, the "One Form of Existence," is not altogether correct. The
Sanskrit word is Prabhavapyaya, "the place, or rather plane, whence
emerges the origination, and into which is the resolution of all
things," says a commentator. It is not the "Mother of the World," as
translated by Wilson (see Book I., Vishnu Purana); for Jagad Yoni (as
shown by FitzEdward Hall) is scarcely so much "the Mother of the World"
or "the Womb of the World" as the "Material Cause of the Universe." The
Puranic Commentators explain it by Karana -- "Cause" -- but the Esoteric
philosophy, by the *ideal spirit of that cause.* It is, in its secondary
stage, the Svabhavat of the Buddhist philosopher, the eternal cause and
effect, omnipresent yet abstract, the self-existent plastic Essence and
the root of all things, viewed in the same dual light as the Vedantin
views his Parabrahm and Mulaprakriti, the one under two aspects. It
seems indeed extraordinary to find great scholars speculating on the
possibility of the Vedanta, and the Uttara-Mimansa especially, having
been "evoked by the teachings of the Buddhists,"

###### \[\[Footnote(s)\]\] -------------------------------------------------

\* In India it is called "The Eye of Siva," but beyond the great range
it is known as "Dangma's opened eye" in esoteric phraseology.

\*\* Dangma means a purified soul, one who has become a Jivanmukta, the
highest adept, or rather a Mahatma so-called. His "opened eye" is the
inner spiritual eye of the seer, and the faculty which manifests through
it is not clairvoyance as ordinarily understood, *i.e.*, the power of
seeing at a distance, but rather the faculty of spiritual intuition,
through which direct and certain knowledge is obtainable. This faculty
is intimately connected with the "third eye," which mythological
tradition ascribes to certain races of men. Fuller explanations will be
found in Book II.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

###### \[\[Vol. 1, Page\]\] 47 THE EYE OF DANGMA.

whereas, it is on the contrary Buddhism (of Gautama, the Buddha) that
was "evoked" and entirely upreared on the tenets of the Secret Doctrine,
of which a partial sketch is here attempted, and on which, also, the
Upanishads are made to rest.\* The above, according to the teachings of
Sri Sankaracharya,\*\* is undeniable.

(*b*) Dreamless sleep is one of the seven states of consciousness known
in Oriental esotericism. In each of these states a different portion of
the mind comes into action; or as a Vedantin would express it, the
individual is conscious in a different plane of his being. The term
"dreamless sleep," in this case is applied allegorically to the Universe
to express a condition somewhat analogous to that state of consciousness
in man, which, not being remembered in a waking state, seems a blank,
just as the sleep of the mesmerised subject seems to him an unconscious
blank when he returns to his normal condition, although he has been
talking and acting as a conscious individual would.

When Gautama Buddha began his career, the *later and lower* form of Yoga
seems to have been little known." And then, contradicting himself, the
learned lecturer forthwith informs his audience that "We learn from
*Lalita-Vistara* that various forms of bodily torture, self-maceration,
and austerity were common in Gautama's time." (!!) But the lecturer
seems quite unaware that this kind of torture and self-maceration is
precisely the *lower* form of Yoga, *Hatha* Yoga, which was "little
known" and yet so "*common*" in Gautama's time.

\*\* It is even argued that all the Six Darsanas (Schools of philosophy)
show traces of Buddha's influence, being either taken from Buddhism or
due to Greek teaching! (See Weber, Max Muller, etc.) We labour under the
impression that Colebrooke, "the highest authority" in such matters, had
long ago settled the question by showing, that "the Hindus were in this
instance the teachers, not the learners."

(*a*) Here we have before us the subject of centuries of scholastic
disputations. The two terms "Alaya" and "Paramartha" have been the
causes of dividing schools and splitting the truth into more different
aspects than any other mystic terms. Alaya is literally the "Soul of the
World" or Anima Mundi, the "Over-Soul" of Emerson, and according to
esoteric teaching it changes periodically its nature. Alaya, though
eternal and changeless in its inner essence on the planes which are
unreachable by either men or Cosmic Gods (Dhyani Buddhas), alters during
the active life-period with respect to the lower planes, ours included.
During that time not only the Dhyani-Buddhas are one with Alaya in Soul
and Essence, but even the man strong in the Yoga (mystic meditation) "is
able to merge his soul with it" (Aryasanga, the *Bumapa* school). This
is not Nirvana, but a condition next to it. Hence the disagreement.
Thus, while the Yogacharyas (of the Mahayana school) say that Alaya is
the personification of the Voidness, and yet Alaya (*Nyingpo* and
*Tsang* in Tibetan) is the basis of every visible and invisible thing,
and that, though it is eternal and immutable in its essence, it reflects
itself in every object of the Universe "like the moon in clear tranquil
water"; other schools dispute the statement. The same for Paramartha:
the Yogacharyas interpret the term as that which is also dependent upon
other things (*paratantra*); and the Madhyamikas say that Paramartha is
limited to Paranishpanna or absolute perfection; *i.e.*, in the
exposition of these "two truths" (out of four), the former believe and
maintain that (on this plane, at any rate) there exists only
Samvritisatya or relative truth; and the latter teach the existence of
Paramarthasatya, the "absolute truth."\* "No Arhat, oh mendicants, can
reach absolute knowledge before he becomes one with Paranirvana.
*Parikalpita* and *Paratantra* are his two great enemies" (Aphorisms of
the Bodhisattvas). *Parikalpita* (in Tibetan *Kun-ttag*) is error, made
by those unable to realize the emptiness and illusionary nature of all;
who believe something to exist which does not -- *e.g.*, the Non-Ego.
And

\*"Paramartha" is self-consciousness in Sanskrit, Svasamvedana, or the
"self-analysing reflection" -- from two words, parama (above everything)
and artha (comprehension), Satya meaning absolute true being, or Esse.
In Tibetan Paramarthasatya is Dondampaidenpa. The opposite of this
absolute reality, or actuality, is Samvritisatya -- the relative truth
only -- "Samvriti" meaning "false conception" and being the origin of
illusion, Maya; in Tibetan Kundzabchi-denpa, "illusion-creating
appearance."

###### \[\[Vol. 1, Page\]\] 49 ALAYA, THE UNIVERSAL SOUL.

*Paratantra* is that, whatever it is, which exists only through a
dependent or causal connexion, and which has to disappear as soon as the
cause from which it proceeds is removed -- *e.g*., the light of a wick.
Destroy or extinguish it, and light disappears.

Esoteric philosophy teaches that everything lives and is conscious, but
not that all life and consciousness are similar to those of human or
even animal beings. Life we look upon as "the one form of existence,"
manifesting in what is called matter; or, as in man, what, incorrectly
separating them, we name Spirit, Soul and Matter. Matter is the vehicle
for the manifestation of soul on this plane of existence, and soul is
the vehicle on a higher plane for the manifestation of spirit, and these
three are a trinity synthesized by Life, which pervades them all. The
idea of universal life is one of those ancient conceptions which are
returning to the human mind in this century, as a consequence of its
liberation from anthropomorphic theology. Science, it is true, contents
itself with tracing or postulating the signs of universal life, and has
not yet been bold enough even to whisper "Anima Mundi!" The idea of
"crystalline life," now familiar to science, would have been scouted
half a century ago. Botanists are now searching for the nerves of
plants; not that they suppose that plants can feel or think as animals
do, but because they believe that some structure, bearing the same
relation functionally to plant life that nerves bear to animal life, is
necessary to explain vegetable growth and nutrition. It hardly seems
possible that science can disguise from itself much longer, by the mere
use of terms such as "force" and "energy," the fact that things that
have life are living things, whether they be atoms or planets.

But what is the belief of the inner esoteric Schools? the reader may
ask. What are the doctrines taught on this subject by the Esoteric
"Buddhists"? With them "Alaya" has a double and even a triple meaning.
In the Yogacharya system of the contemplative Mahayana school, Alaya is
both the Universal Soul (Anima Mundi) and the Self of a progressed
adept. "He who is strong in the Yoga can introduce at will his Alaya by
means of meditation into the true Nature of Existence." The "Alaya has
an absolute eternal existence," says Aryasanga -- the rival of
Nagarjuna.\* In one sense it is *Pradhana;* which

###### \[\[Footnote(s)\]\] -------------------------------------------------

esoteric school, though Csoma di Koros places him, for some reasons of
his own, in the seventh century \[\[Footnote continued on next page\]\]

is explained in Vishnu Purana as: "that which is the unevolved cause, is
emphatically called by the most eminent sages Pradhana, original base,
which is subtile Prakriti, viz., that which is eternal, and which at
once is (or comprehends) what is and what is not, or is mere process."
"Prakriti," however, is an incorrect word, and Alaya would explain it
better; for Prakriti is not the "uncognizable Brahma."\* It is a mistake
of those who know nothing of the Universality of the Occult doctrines
from the very cradle of the human races, and especially so of those
scholars who reject the very idea of a "primordial revelation," to teach
that the Anima Mundi, the One Life or "Universal Soul," was made known
only by Anaxagoras, or during his age. This philosopher brought the
teaching forward simply to oppose the too materialistic conceptions on
Cosmogony of Democritus, based on his exoteric theory of *blindly*
driven atoms. Anaxagoras of Clazomene was not its inventor but only its
propagator, as also was Plato. That which he called Mundane
Intelligence, the nous (\[\[*nous*\]\]), the principle that according to
his views is absolutely separated and free from matter and acts on
design,\*\* was called Motion, the ONE LIFE, or *Jivatma*, ages before
the year 500 B.C. in India. Only the Aryan philosophers never endowed
the principle, which with them is infinite, with the finite "attribute"
of "thinking."

This leads the reader naturally to the "Supreme Spirit" of Hegel and the
German Transcendentalists as a contrast that it may be useful to point
out. The schools of Schelling and Fichte have diverged widely from the
primitive archaic conception of an ABSOLUTE principle, and have mirrored
only an aspect of the basic idea of the Vedanta. Even the "Absoluter
Geist" shadowed forth by von Hartman in his pessimistic philosophy of
the Unconscious, while it is, perhaps, the closest approximation made by
European speculation to the Hindu Adwaitee Doctrines, similarly falls
far short of the reality.

\[\[Footnote continued from previous page\]\] A.D. There was another
Aryasanga, who lived during the first centuries of our era and the
Hungarian scholar most probably confuses the two.

\* "The indiscreet cause which is uniform, and both cause and effect,
and which those who are acquainted with first principles call Pradhana
and Prakriti, is the incognizable Brahma who was before all" (Vayu
Purana); *i.e.*, Brahma does not put forth evolution itself or create,
but only exhibits various aspects of itself, one of which is Prakriti,
an aspect of Pradhana.

\*\* Finite Self-consciousness, I mean. For how can the *absolute*
attain it otherwise than as simply an *aspect*, the highest of which
known to us is human consciousness?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

###### \[\[Vol. 1, Page\]\] 51 CAN THE FINITE CONCEIVE THE INFINITE?

According to Hegel, the "Unconscious" would never have undertaken the
vast and laborious task of evolving the Universe, except in the hope of
attaining clear Self-consciousness. In this connection it is to be borne
in mind that in designating Spirit, which the European Pantheists use as
equivalent to Parabrahm, as unconscious, they do not attach to that
expression of "Spirit" -- one employed in the absence of a better to
symbolise a profound mystery -- the connotation it usually bears.

The "Absolute Consciousness," they tell us, "behind" phenomena, which is
only termed unconsciousness in the absence of any element of
personality, transcends human conception. Man, unable to form one
concept except in terms of empirical phenomena, is powerless from the
very constitution of his being to raise the veil that shrouds the
majesty of the Absolute. Only the liberated Spirit is able to faintly
realise the nature of the source whence it sprung and whither it must
eventually return. . . . As the highest Dhyan Chohan, however, can but
bow in ignorance before the awful mystery of Absolute Being; and since,
even in that culmination of conscious existence -- "the merging of the
individual in the universal consciousness" -- to use a phrase of
Fichte's -- the Finite cannot conceive the Infinite, nor can it apply to
it its own standard of mental experiences, how can it be said that the
"Unconscious" and the Absolute can have even an instinctive impulse or
hope of attaining clear self-consciousness?\* A Vedantin would never
admit this Hegelian idea; and the Occultist would say that it applies
perfectly to the awakened MAHAT, the Universal Mind already projected
into the phenomenal world as the first aspect of the changeless
ABSOLUTE, but never to the latter. "Spirit and Matter, or Purusha and
Prakriti are but the two primeval aspects of the One and Secondless," we
are taught.

The matter-moving Nous, the animating Soul, immanent in every atom,
manifested in man, latent in the stone, has different degrees of power;
and this pantheistic idea of a general Spirit-Soul pervading all Nature
is the oldest of all the philosophical notions. Nor was the Archaeus a
discovery of Paracelsus nor of his pupil Van Helmont; for it is again
the same Archaeus or "Father-Ether," -- the manifested basis

and source of the innumerable phenomena of life -- localised. The whole
series of the numberless speculations of this kind are but variations on
this theme, the key-note of which was struck in this primeval
Revelation. (See Part II., "Primordial Substance.")

(*b*) The term Anupadaka, "parentless," or without progenitors, is a
mystical designation having several meanings in the philosophy. By this
name celestial beings, the Dhyan-Chohans or Dhyani-Buddhas, are
generally meant. But as these correspond mystically to the human Buddhas
and Bodhisattwas, known as the "Manushi (or human) Buddhas," the latter
are also designated "Anupadaka," once that their whole personality is
merged in their compound sixth and seventh principles -- or Atma-Buddhi,
and that they have become the "diamond-souled" (Vajra-sattvas),\* the
full Mahatmas. The "Concealed Lord" (Sangbai Dag-po), "the one merged
with the absolute," can have no parents since he is Self-existent, and
one with the Universal Spirit (Svayambhu),\*\* the Svabhavat in the
highest aspect. The mystery in the hierarchy of the Anupadaka is great,
its apex being the universal Spirit-Soul, and the lower rung the
Manushi-Buddha; and even every Soul-endowed man is an Anupadaka in a
latent state. Hence, when speaking of the Universe in its formless,
eternal, or absolute condition, before it was fashioned by the
"Builders" -- the expression, "the Universe was Anupadaka." (See Part
II., "Primordial Substance.")

\* Vajra -- diamond-holder. In Tibetan *Dorjesempa; sempa* meaning the
soul, its adamantine quality referring to its indestructibility in the
hereafter. The explanation with regard to the "Anupadaka" given in the
Kala Chakra, the first in the Gyu(t) division of the Kanjur, is half
esoteric. It has misled the Orientalists into erroneous speculations
with respect to the Dhyani-Buddhas and their earthly correspondencies,
the Manushi-Buddhas. The real tenet is hinted at in a subsequent Volume,
(see "The Mystery about Buddha"), and will be more fully explained in
its proper place.

\*\* To quote Hegel again, who with Schelling practically accepted the
Pantheistic conception of periodical Avatars (special incarnations of
the World-Spirit in Man, as seen in the case of all the great religious
reformers) . . . . "the essence of man is spirit . . . . only by
stripping himself of his finiteness and surrendering himself to pure
self-consciousness does he attain the truth. Christ-man, as man in whom
the Unity of God-man (identity of the individual with the Universal
consciousness as taught by the Vedantins and some Adwaitees) appeared,
has, in his death and history generally, himself presented the eternal
history of Spirit -- a history which every man has to accomplish in
himself, in order to exist as Spirit." -- *Philosophy of History.*
