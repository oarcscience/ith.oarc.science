<P>
<STRONG>T</STRONG>HE <STRONG>P</STRONG>RIMEVAL <STRONG>M</STRONG>ANUS
OF <STRONG>H</STRONG>UMANITY.
<P>
Those who are aware that the &quot;great Flood,&quot; which was
connected with the sinking of an entire continent -- save what
became a few islands -- could not have happened so far back as
18,000,000 years ago; and that Vaivasvata Manu is the Indian Noah
connected with the <EM>Matsya </EM>(or the fish) Avatar of Vishnu
-- may feel perplexed at this discrepancy between facts stated
and the chronology previously given. But there is no discrepancy
in truth. The reader is asked to turn to the <EM>Theosophist</EM>
of July, 1883, and after studying the article therein, &quot;The
Septenary Principle in Esotericism,&quot; the whole question can
be explained to him. It is in this explanation, I believe, that
the Occultists differ from the Brahmins.
<P>
For the benefit of those, however, who may not have &quot;The
Theosophist&quot; of that month and year to hand, a passage or
two may now be quoted from it:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;Who was Manu, the son of Swayambhuva? The secret doctrine
tells us that <I>this </I>Manu was no man, but the representation
of the first human races evolved with the help of the Dhyan-Chohans
(<I>Devas</I>) at the beginning of the first round. But we are
told in his Laws (<I>Book I. </I>80) that there are fourteen Manus
for every Kalpa -- or interval from creation to creation (read
interval from one <I>minor</I> 'Pralaya' to another*) -- and that
in the present divine age, there have been as yet <I>seven </I>Manus.
Those who know that there are seven rounds, of which we have passed
three, and are now in the fourth; and who are
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
* <EM>Pralaya</EM> -- a word already explained -- is not a term
that applies <EM>only </EM>to every &quot;Night of Brahma,&quot;
or the world's dissolution following every Manvantara, equal to
71 Maha-yugas. It applies also to each &quot;obscuration&quot;
as well, and even to every Cataclysm that puts an end, by Fire
or by Water in turn, to each Root-Race. <EM>Pralaya</EM> is a
term like that of &quot;Manu&quot; -- the generic name for the
<EM>Sishtas, </EM>who, under the appellation of &quot;King,&quot;
are shown in <EM>the Puranas </EM>as preserved &quot;with the
seed of all things in an ark from the waters of that flood&quot;
(or the fires of a general volcanic conflagration, the commencement
of which we already see for our Fifth-Race in the terrible earthquakes
and eruptions of these late years, and especially in the present
one) . . . . which in the season of a pralaya overspreads the
world&quot; (the Earth). (<EM>See Preface,</EM> <EM>p. lxxxi.</EM>,
to Wilson's &quot;<EM>Vishnu Purana.</EM>&quot;) Time is only
a form of &quot;Vishnu&quot; -- truly, as Parasara says in that
Purana. In the Hindu Yuga Kalpa, we have the regular descending
series 4, 3, 2, with ciphers multiplied as occasion requires for
esoteric purposes, but not, as Wilson and other Orientalists thought,
for &quot;sectarian embellishments.&quot; A Kalpa may be an age,
a &quot;Day&quot; of Brahma, or a sidereal Kalpa, astronomical
and earthly. Those calculations are found in all the Puranas,
but some differ -- as for instance, &quot;the year of the seven
Rishis, 3,030 mortal years, and the year of Dhruva, 9,090 in the
Linga Purana,&quot; which are again esoteric, and which <EM>do</EM>
represent actual (secret) chronology. As said in the <EM>Brahma
Vaivarta: </EM>&quot;Chronologers compute a Kalpa by the life
of Brahma. <EM>Minor </EM>Kalpas, as Samvarta and the rest, are
numerous.&quot; &quot;<EM>Minor</EM> Kalpas&quot; denote here
every period of destruction, as was well understood by Wilson
himself, who explains the latter as &quot;those in which the Samvarta
wind or other destructive agents operate&quot; (<EM>Vishnu Purana,
p. </EM>54<EM>, vol. I</EM>.). <HR>

taught that there are seven dawns and seven twilights or fourteen<I>
Manvantaras; </I>that at the beginning of every Round and at the
end, and on, and between the planets there is an awakening to
<I>illusive </I>life, and an awakening to <I>real </I>life; and
that, moreover, there are root-Manus, and what we have to clumsily
translate as the seed-Manus -- <I>the</I> <I>seeds for the human
races of</I> <I>the forthcoming </I>Round (or the <I>Sishtas --
</I>the<I> </I>surviving fittest*; a mystery divulged only to
those who have passed their third degree in initiation) -- those
who have learned all that will be better prepared to understand
the meaning of the following. We are told in the Sacred Hindu
scriptures that the first Manu produced <I>six</I> other Manus
(<I>seven</I> primary Manus in all), and these produced in their
turn each seven other Manus** (<I>Bhrigu I, </I>61-63) -- the
production of the latter standing in the occult treatises as 7
x 7. Thus it becomes clear that Manu -- the last one, the progenitor
of our Fourth Round Humanity -- must be the <I>seventh, </I>since
we are on our fourth Round,*** and there is a <I>root</I>-Manu
at globe A and a <I>seed </I>Manu at globe G. Just as each planetary
Round commences with the appearance of a 'Root Manu' (Dhyan Chohan)
and closes with a 'Seed-Manu,' so a <I>Root </I>and a <I>Seed
</I>Manu appear respectively at the beginning and the termination
of the human period on any particular planet.**** It will be easily
seen from the foregoing statement that a<I> Manu-antaric </I>period
means, as the term implies, the time <I>between </I>the

<P>
* An intuition and a presentiment of the Sishtas may be found
in Mr. Sinnett's &quot;Esoteric Buddhism, &quot;Fifth Edition.
See in it <EM>Annotations</EM> -- the &quot;Noah's Ark Theory&quot;
pp. 146, 147.
<P>
** The fact that Manu himself is made to declare that he was created
by Viraj, and that he then produced the ten Prajapatis, who again
produced seven Manus, who in their turn gave birth to seven other
Manus (<EM>Manu, I, </EM>33-36) relates to other still earlier
mysteries, and is at the same time a <EM>blind</EM> with regard
to the doctrine of the Septenary chain, and the simultaneous evolution
of seven humanities, or <STRONG>M</STRONG>EN. However, the present
work is written on the records of Cis-Himalayan Secret Teachings,
and Brahmanical esoteric philosophy may now differ in form as
the Kabala does. But they were identical in hoary antiquity.
<P>
*** There is another <EM>esoteric </EM>reason besides this one
for it. A Vaivasvata is the <EM>seventh </EM>Manu, because this
our Round, although the Fourth, is in the <EM>preseptenary</EM>
Manvantara, and the Round itself is in its <EM>seventh </EM>stage
of materiality or physicality. The close of its middle racial
point occurred during the Fourth Root Race, when man and all nature
reached their lowest state of gross matter. From that time, <EM>i.e.</EM>,
from the end of the three and a half races, humanity and nature
entered on the ascending arc of their racial cycle.
<P>
**** The interval that precedes each Yuga is called a <EM>Sandhya,
</EM>composed of as many hundreds of years as there are thousands
in the yuga; and that which follows the latter is named <EM>Sandhyamsa,
</EM>and is of similar duration, we are told in <EM>Vishnu Purana.
</EM>&quot;The interval between the Sandhya and the Sandhyamsa
is the yuga denominated Krita, Treta, etc., etc. The (four) Krita,
Treta, Dwapara, and Kali constitute a great age, or aggregate
of four ages: a 1000 such aggregates are a Day of Brahma; and
14 <EM>Manus</EM> <EM>reign within that term</EM>.&quot; Now had
we to accept this literally then there would be only one Manu
for every 4,320,000,000 of years. As we are taught that it took
300,000,000 of years for the two lower kingdoms to evolve, and
that our humanity is just 18 and some odd millions old -- where
were the other Manus spoken of, unless the allegory means what
the esoteric doctrine teaches us about the 14 being each multiplied
by 49.<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 309 THE BLINDS OF EXOTERICISM.</H6>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
appearance of two Manus or Dhyan Chohans; and hence a minor <I>Manvantara</I>
is the duration of the <I>seven </I>races on any particular planet,
and a major manvantara is the period of one human round along
the Planetary chain. Moreover, that, as it is said that each of
the seven Manus <I>creates </I>7 x 7 Manus, and that there are
49 root-races on the seven planets during each Round, then every
root-race has its Manu. The present seventh Manu is called 'Vaivasvata'
and stands in the exoteric texts for that Manu who represents
in India the Babylonian Xisuthrus and the Jewish Noah. But in
the esoteric books we are told that Manu Vaivasvata, the progenitor
of our <I>Fifth </I>race -- who saved it from the flood that nearly
exterminated the Fourth (Atlantis) -- is not the seventh Manu,
mentioned in the nomenclature of the Root, or primitive-Manus,
but one of the 49 Manus emanated from this Root-Manu.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;For clearer comprehension we here give the names of the
14 Manus in their respective order and relation to each Round:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;Vaivasvata, thus, though seventh in the order given, is
the primitive Root-Manu of our fourth Human Wave (the reader must
always remember that Manu is not a man but collective humanity),
while<I> our</I> Vaivasvata was but one of the seven <I>Minor
</I>Manus, who are made to preside over the seven races of this
our planet. Each of these has to become the witness of one of
the periodical and ever-recurring cataclysms (by fire and water)
that close the cycle of every Root-race. And it is this Vaivasvata
-- the Hindu ideal embodiment, called respectively Xisuthrus,
Deukalion, Noah and by other names -- who is the allegorical man
who rescued our race, when nearly the whole population of one
hemisphere perished by water, while the other hemisphere was awakening
from its temporary obscuration.&quot;*

<P>
* The words &quot;creation,&quot; &quot;dissolution,&quot; etc.,
do not render correctly the right meaning of either Manvantara
or Pralaya. The <EM>Vishnu Purana </EM>enumerates several: The
dissolution of all things is of four kinds, Parasara is made to
<EM>say: -- Naimittika</EM> (occasional), when Brahma slumbers
(his night, when, &quot;At the end of this day occurs a re-coalescence
<EM>of the Universe, </EM>called Brahma's contingent re-coalescence,&quot;
because Brahma <EM>is</EM> this universe itself); &quot;<EM>Prakritika</EM>
(elemental), when the return of this universe to its original
nature is partial and physical; <EM>Atyantika</EM> (absolute),
identification of <EM>the embodied </EM>with the incorporeal Supreme
spirit -- Mahatmic state, whether temporary or until the following
<EM>Maha Kalpa: </EM>also absolute obscuration -- as of a whole
[[Footnote continued on next page]] <HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 310 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</H6>

<P>
Thus it is shown that there is no real discrepancy in speaking
of the Vaivasvata Manvantara (<EM>Manu-antara, </EM>lit. &quot;between
two Manus&quot;) 18,000,000 odd years ago, when physical, or the
truly human man first appeared in his Fourth Round on this earth;
and of the other Vaivasvatas, <EM>e.g., </EM>the Manu of the Great
Cosmic or sidereal Flood (a mystery), or again the Manu Vaivasvata
of the submerged Atlantis, when the <EM>racial</EM> Vaivasvata
saved the elect of Humanity, the Fifth Race, from utter destruction.
As the several (and quite different) events are purposely blended
in the <EM>Vishnu </EM>and other Puranas in one narrative, there
may yet be a great deal of perplexity left in the profane reader's
mind. Therefore, as constant elucidation is needed, we must be
forgiven unavoidable repetitions. The blinds which conceal the
real mysteries of Esoteric philosophy are great and puzzling,
and even now the last word cannot be given. The veil, however,
may be a little more removed and some explanations, hitherto denied,
may now be offered to the earnest student.
<P>
As somebody -- Colonel Vans Kennedy, if we do not mistake -- remarked,
&quot;the first principle in Hindu religious philosophy is <EM>Unity
in</EM> <EM>diversity.</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>If all those Manus
and Rishis are called by one generic name, this is due to the
fact that they are one and all the manifested Energies of one
and the same <STRONG>L</STRONG>OGOS, the celestial, as well as
the terrestrial messengers and permutations of that Principle
which is ever in a state of activity; conscious during the period
of Cosmic evolution, unconscious (from our point of view) during
Cosmic rest, as the Logos sleepeth in the bosom of THAT which
&quot;sleepeth not,&quot; nor is it ever awake -- for it is SAT
or <EM>Be-ness, </EM>not a Being. It is from IT that issues the
great unseen Logos, who evolves all the other <EM>logoi, </EM>the
primeval <STRONG>M</STRONG>ANU who gives being to the other Manus,
who emanate the universe and all in it collectively, and who represent
in their aggregate the <EM>manifested </EM>Logos.* Hence we learn
in the &quot;Commentaries&quot; that while no Dhyan Chohan, not
even the highest, can realise completely &quot;the condition of
the preceding Cosmic evolution,&quot; &quot;the Manus retain a
knowledge of their experiences of all the Cosmic evolutions throughout
Eternity.&quot; This is very plain: the first Manu is called <EM>Swayambhuva,</EM>

and <EM>Nitya </EM>(perpetual) <EM>Mahapralaya </EM>for the Universe,
<EM>death -- </EM>for man, <EM>nitya</EM> is the extinction of
life, like the extinction of a lamp,&quot; also &quot;in sleep

ensues after a minor dissolution is called ephemeral creation.

difficult that we are obliged to repeat our statements.

&quot;the Self-manifested,&quot; the Son of the <EM>unmanifested
</EM><STRONG>F</STRONG>ATHER. The Manus are the creators of the
creators of our First Race -- the Spirit of mankind -- which does
not prevent the <EM>seven </EM>Manus from having been the first
&quot;pre-Adamic&quot; men on Earth.
<P>
Manu declares himself created by Viraj,* or Vaiswanara, (the Spirit
of Humanity),** which means that his Monad emanates from the never
resting Principle in the beginning of every new Cosmic activity:
that <EM>Logos </EM>or <STRONG>U</STRONG>NIVERSAL <STRONG>M</STRONG>ONAD
(collective Elohim) that radiates <EM>from</EM> <EM>within himself
all </EM>those Cosmic Monads that become the centres of activity
-- progenitors of the numberless Solar systems as well as of the
yet undifferentiated <EM>human</EM> monads of planetary chains
as well as of every being thereon. Each Cosmic Monad is &quot;Swayambhuva,&quot;
the SELF-BORN, <EM>which becomes the Centre of Force, from within
which</EM> <EM>emerges a planetary chain </EM>(of which chains
there are seven in our system), and whose radiations become again
so many Manus Swayambhuva (a generic name, mysterious and meaning
far more than appears), each of these becoming, as a <EM>Host,
</EM>the Creator of his own Humanity. (<EM>See </EM>&quot;<EM>The
Manus and the Manvantaras Explained by a Western Mystic</EM> <EM>and
Mathematician.</EM>&quot;)
<P>
As to the question of the four distinct races of mankind that
preceded our Fifth Race, there is nothing mystical in it, except
the ethereal bodies of the first races; and it is a matter of
legendary, nevertheless, very correct history. That legend is
universal. And if the Western <EM>savant </EM>pleases to see in
it only a myth, it does not make the slightest difference. The
Mexicans had, and still have, the tradition of the fourfold destruction
of the world by fire and water, just as the Egyptians had, and
the Hindus have, to this day.
<P>
Trying to account for the community of legends in the remote antiquity
-- held by Chinese, Chaldean, Egyptians, Indians and Greeks --
and for the absence of any certain vestige of civilization more
ancient than 5,000 years, the author of &quot;<EM>Mythical Monsters,</EM>&quot;<EM>
</EM>remarks, that &quot;we must not be surprised if we do not
immediately discover the vestiges of the people of ten, fifteen,
or twenty thousand years ago. With an ephemeral architecture (as
in China), the sites of vast cities may have become entirely lost
to recollection in a few thousands of years from natural decay
. . . and how much more . . . if . . . minor cataclysms have intervened,
such as local inundations, earthquakes, deposition of volcanic
ashes, the spread of sandy deserts, destruction of life by

It is the most objective (to us the reverse) and ever present

deadly pestilence, by miasma, or by the outpour of sulphurous
fumes.&quot; (&quot;<EM>Mythical Monsters,</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>by
Ch. Gould, p. 134.)
<P>
And how many of such cataclysms have changed the whole surface
of the earth may be inferred from this <EM>Stanza:</EM> 
<P>
&quot;<EM>During the first seven </EM>crores <EM>of the Kalpa
</EM>(70,000,000 years) <EM>the</EM> <EM>Earth and its two Kingdoms
</EM>(mineral and vegetable), <EM>one already having</EM> <EM>achieved
its seventh circle, the other, hardly nascent, are luminous and</EM>
<EM>semi-ethereal, cold, lifeless, and translucid. In the eleventh
crore* the</EM> <EM>mother</EM> (Earth) <EM>grows opaque, and
in the </EM>FOURTEENTH** <EM>the throes of</EM> <EM>adolescence
take place. These convulsions of nature </EM>(geological changes)
<EM>last till her twentieth crore of years, uninterruptedly, after
which they</EM> <EM>become periodical, and at long intervals.</EM>&quot;
<P>
<EM>The last change took place nearly twelve crores of years ago
</EM>(<EM>120,000,000</EM>)<EM>. But the Earth with everything
on her face had become cool,</EM> <EM>hard and settled ages earlier.
</EM>(<EM>Commentary, xxii.</EM>)
<P>
Thus, if we are to believe esoteric teaching, there have been
no more <EM>universal </EM>geological disturbances and changes
for the last 120 millions of years, and the Earth was, even before
that time, ready to receive her human stock. The appearance of
the latter, however, in its full physical development, as already
stated, took place only about eighteen millions of years ago,
after the first great failure of nature to create beings alone,
without the help of the divine &quot;Fashioners,&quot; had been
followed by the successive evolution of the first three races
(<EM>See</EM> <EM>above Stanzas III. et seq</EM>.).<EM> </EM>The
actual duration of the first two and a-half Races is withheld
from all but the higher Initiates. The History of the Races begins
at the separation of the Sexes, when the preceding egg-bearing
androgynous race perished rapidly, and the subsequent sub-races
of the

<P>
* This -- in the period of <EM>Secondary </EM>creation, so called.
Of the <EM>Primary, </EM>when Earth is in possession of the three<EM>
Elemental</EM> Kingdoms, we cannot speak for several reasons,
one of which is, that, unless one is a great seer, or naturally
intuitional, he will be unable to realise that which can never
be expressed in any existing terms.
<P>
** Hippocrates said that number seven &quot;By its occult virtues
tended to the accomplishment of all things, to be the dispenser
of life and fountain of all its changes.&quot; The life of man
he divided into seven ages (Shakespeare), for &quot;As the moon
changes her phases every seven days, this number influences all
sublunary beings,&quot; and even the Earth, as we know. With the
child, it is the teeth that appear in the seventh month and he
sheds them at seven years; at twice seven puberty begins, at three
times seven all our mental and vital powers are developed, at
four times seven he is in his full strength, at five times seven
his passions are most developed, etc., etc. Thus for the Earth.
It is now in its middle age, yet very little wiser for it. The
<EM>Tetragrammaton,</EM> the four-lettered sacred name of the
Deity, can be resolved on Earth only by becoming Septenary through
the manifest triangle proceeding from the concealed <EM>Tetraktis</EM>.
Therefore, the number seven has to be adopted on this plane. As
written in the Kabala &quot;The greater Holy Assembly&quot; v.
1161: -- &quot;For assuredly there is no stability in those six,
save (what they derive) from <EM>the seventh. </EM>For <EM>all
things depend from the </EM>SEVENTH.&quot;<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 313 THE ESOTERIC MEANING OF &quot;FISH.&quot;
</H6>

<P>
Third Root-Race appeared as an entirely new race <EM>physiologically.
It</EM> is this &quot;destruction&quot; which is called allegorically
the great &quot;Vaivasvata Manu Deluge,&quot; when the account
shows Vaivasvata Manu (or &quot;Humanity&quot;) remaining alone
on Earth in the Ark of Salvation towed by Vishnu in the shape
of a monstrous fish, and the Seven Rishis &quot;with him.&quot;
The allegory is very plain: --
<P>
In the Symbolism of every nation, the &quot;Deluge&quot; stands
for Chaotic unsettled matter -- Chaos itself: and the Water for
the feminine principle -- the &quot;Great Deep.&quot; As the Greek
Lexicon of Parkhurst gives it -- &quot;<EM>Arche</EM> (ark) answers
to the Hebrew <EM>rasit, </EM>or Wisdom . . . . and (at the same
time) to the emblem of the female generative power, the <EM>Arg</EM>
or <EM>Arca, </EM>in which the germ of nature (and of mankind)
floats or broods on the great Abyss of the waters, during the
interval which takes place after every mundane (or racial) cycle.&quot;
Ark is also the mystic name of the divine spirit of <EM>life</EM>
which broods over chaos. Now Vishnu <EM>is </EM>the divine Spirit,
as an abstract principle, and also as the <EM>Preserver</EM> and
<EM>Generator, </EM>or <EM>Giver of life </EM>-- the third person
of the Trimurti (composed of Brahma, the Creator, Siva, the Destroyer,
and Vishnu, the Preserver). Vishnu is shown in the allegory as
guiding, under the form of a <EM>fish, </EM>the Ark of Vaivasvata
Manu clean across the waters of the Flood. There is no use in
expatiating upon the esoteric meaning of the word <EM>fish.</EM>
(<EM>See Payne Knight, Inman, Gerald Massey, etc.</EM>) Its theological
meanings is phallic, but the metaphysical, <EM>divine</EM>. Jesus
is called the &quot;Fish,&quot; and so were Vishnu and Bacchus:
[[<EM>Ies</EM>]], the &quot;Saviour&quot; of mankind, being but
the monogram of the god Bacchus called [[<EM>Ichthus</EM>]], the
fish.* As to the Seven Rishis in the Ark, they symbolised the
seven principles, which became complete in man only after he had
separated, and become a <EM>human, </EM>and no longer a divine
creature. (<EM>See for further</EM> <EM>details, </EM>&quot;<EM>The
Seventh Manu.</EM>&quot;)
<P>
Nor have we many details about the submersion of the continent
inhabited by the Second Root Race. But the history of the Third,
&quot;Lemuria,&quot; is given, as is that of Atlantis, the others
being only alluded to. Lemuria is said to have perished about
700,000 years before the commencement of what is now called the
Tertiary age (the Eocene),** and it is during this Deluge also
-- an actual geological deluge this time -- that Vaivasvata Manu
is again shown as saving mankind (allegorically it is mankind,
or a portion of it, the Fourth Race, which is saved); so also
he saves the Fifth Race during the destruction of the last Atlanteans,

remnants that perished 850,000 years ago,* after which there was
no great submersion until the day of Plato's Atlantis, or Poseidonis,
known to the Egyptians only because it happened in such relatively
recent times.
<P>
It is the submersion of the great Atlantis which is the most interesting.
It is of this cataclysm that the old records (<EM>See the </EM>&quot;<EM>Book
of Enoch</EM>&quot;) say that &quot;the ends of the Earth got
loose;&quot; and upon which the legends and allegories of Vaivasvata,
Xisuthrus, Noah, Deukalion and all the <EM>tutti quanti </EM>of
the Elect saved, have been built. Tradition, taking into no account
the difference between sidereal and geological phenomena, calls
both indifferently &quot;deluges.&quot; Yet there is a great difference.
The cataclysm which destroyed the huge continent of which Australia
is the largest relic, was due to a series of subterranean convulsions
and the breaking asunder of the ocean floors. That which put an
end to its successor -- the fourth continent -- was brought on
by successive disturbances in the axial rotation. It began during
the earliest tertiary periods, and, continuing for long ages,
carried away successively the last vestige of Atlantis, with the
exception, perhaps, of Ceylon and a small portion of what is now
Africa. It changed the face of the globe, and no memory of its
flourishing continents and isles, of its civilizations and sciences,
remained in the annals of history, save in the Sacred records
of the East.
<P>
Hence, Modern Science denies Atlantis and its existence. It even
denies any violent shiftings of the Earth's axis, and would attribute
the reason for the change of climates to other causes. But this
question is still an open one. If Dr. Croll will have it that
all such alterations can be accounted for by the effects of nutation
and the precession of the equinoxes, there are other men of Science,
such as Sir H. James (<EM>Athenaeum, Aug. </EM>25, 1860), and
Sir John Lubbock (<EM>ibid</EM>), who feel more inclined to accept
the idea that they are due to a change in the position of the
axis of rotation. Against this the majority of the astronomers
are again arrayed. But then, what have they not denied before
now, and what have they not denounced -- only to accept it later
on whenever the hypothesis became undeniable fact?
<P>
How far our figures agree, or rather disagree with modern Science
will be seen further in the <EM>Addenda </EM>to this Book, where
the geology and anthropology of our modern day are carefully compared
with the same in Archaic Science. At any rate, the period assigned
in the Secret Doctrine for the sinking of Atlantis, does not seem
to disagree

* This event, the destruction of the famous island of <EM>Ruta
</EM>and the smaller one <EM>Daitya, </EM>which occurred 850,000
years ago in the later Pliocene times, must not be confounded
with the submersion of the main continent of Atlantis during the
Miocene period. Geologists cannot place the Miocene only so short
a way back as 850,000 years; whatever they do, it is several million
years ago that the main Atlantis perished.<HR>

<P>
very much with the calculations of Modern Science, which calls
Atlantis &quot;Lemuria,&quot; however, whenever it accepts such
a submerged continent. With regard to the pre-human period, all
that can be said, at present, is, that even up to the appearance
of the &quot;Mindless&quot; First Race, the Earth was not without
its inhabitants. More may be said: that which Science -- recognizing
<EM>only physical man -- </EM>has a right to regard as the <EM>prehuman
</EM>period, may be conceded to have extended from the First Race
down to the first half of the Atlantean race, since it is only
then that man became the &quot;complete <EM>organic </EM>being
he is now.&quot; And this would make <EM>Adamic </EM>man no older
than a few million of years.*

The author of the Qabbalah remarks truly that &quot;Man to-day,
as an individual, is only a concatenation of the being-hood of
precedent human life,&quot; or <EM>lives, </EM>rather. &quot;According
to the Qabbalah, the soul sparks contained in Adam (Rishoun),
went into three principal classes corresponding to his three <EM>sons,
</EM>viz.: Hesed, Habel, Ge-boor-ah, Qai-yin and <EM>Ra</EM>'<EM>hmin</EM>
Seth. These three were divided into 70 species, called: the principal
roots of the human race.&quot; (p. 422.)
<P>
&quot;Said Rabbi Jehudah: 'How many garments (of the incorporeal
man) are these which are crowned' (from the day man was 'created')?
Said R. El'eazar: 'The mountains of the world (the great men of
the generation) are in discussion upon it, but there are three:
one to clothe in that garment the Rua'h spirit, which is in the
garden (of Eden) on earth: one which is more precious than all,
in which the <EM>Neshamah is </EM>clothed in that Bundle of Life,
between the angels of the Kings . . . : and one outside garment,
which exists and does not exist, is seen and not seen. In that
garment, the <EM>Nephesh </EM>is clothed, and she goes and flies
in it, to and fro in the world.&quot; (Zohar I., 119<EM>b</EM>.
col. 475; Qabbalah, 412.)
<P>
This relates to the races (their &quot;garments,&quot; or degree
of materiality) and to the three principles of man in their three
vehicles.

* Mr. Huxley divides those races into the quintuple group of Australioids,
Negroids, Mongoloids, Xanthochroics and Melanochroics -- all issuing
from imaginary Anthropoids. And yet, while protesting against
those who say &quot;that the structural differences between man
and apes are small and insignificant,&quot; and adding that &quot;every
bone of the gorilla bears a mark by which it can be distinguished
from a corresponding human bone,&quot; and that &quot;in the present
state of creation, at least, no intermediary being fills the gap
which separates the man from the troglodyte&quot; -- the great
anatomist goes on speaking of the Simian characteristics in Man!
