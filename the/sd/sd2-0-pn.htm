<STRONG>M</STRONG>ODERN science insists upon the doctrine of evolution;
so do human reason and the &quot;Secret Doctrine,&quot; and the
idea is corroborated by the ancient legends and myths, and even
by the Bible itself when it is read between the lines. We see
a flower slowly developing from a bud, and the bud from its seed.
But whence the latter, with all its predetermined programme of
physical transformation, and its invisible, therefore <I>spiritual
</I>forces which gradually develop its form, colour, and odour?
The word <I>evolution </I>speaks for itself. The germ of the present
human race must have preexisted in the parent of this race, as
the seed, in which lies hidden the flower of next summer, was
developed in the capsule of its parent flower; the parent may
be but <I>slightly </I>different, but it still differs from its
future progeny. The antediluvian ancestors of the present elephant
and lizard were, perhaps, the mammoth and the plesiosaurus; why
should not the progenitors of our human race have been the &quot;<I>giants</I>&quot;
of the <I>Vedas, </I>the<I> Voluspa, </I>and the Book of <I>Genesis?
</I>While it is positively absurd to believe the &quot;transformation
of species&quot; to have taken place according to some of the
more materialistic views of the evolutionists, it is but natural
to think that each genus, beginning with the molluscs and ending
with man, had modified its own primordial and distinctive forms.

<STRONG>T</STRONG>HE Stanzas, with the Commentaries thereon, in
this Book, the second, are drawn from the same Archaic Records
as the Stanzas on Cosmogony in Book I. As far as possible a verbatim
translation is given; but some of the Stanzas were too obscure
to be understood without explanation. Hence, as was done in Book
I., while they are first given in full as they stand, when taken
verse by verse with their Commentaries an attempt is made to make
them clearer, by words added in brackets, in anticipation of the
fuller explanation of the Commentary.
<P>
As regards the evolution of mankind, the Secret Doctrine postulates
three new propositions, which stand in direct antagonism to modern
science as well as to current religious dogmas: it teaches<EM>
</EM>(<EM>a</EM>) the simultaneous evolution of seven human groups
on seven different portions of our globe; (<EM>b</EM>) the birth
of the <EM>astral, </EM>before the <EM>physical</EM> body: the
former being a model for the latter; and (<EM>c</EM>) that man,
in this Round, preceded every mammalian -- the anthropoids included
-- in the animal kingdom.*

* See Genesis ch. ii., v. 19. Adam is formed in verse 7, and in
verse 19 it is said: &quot;Out of the <EM>ground </EM>the Lord
God formed <EM>every beast of the field, and every fowl of the
air;</EM> <EM>and brought them unto Adam </EM>to see what he would
call them.&quot; Thus man was created <EM>before </EM>the animals;
for the animals mentioned in chapter i. are the signs of the Zodiac,
while the man, &quot;male and female,&quot; is not <EM>man, </EM>but
the Host of the Sephiroth; <STRONG>F</STRONG>ORCES, or Angels,
&quot;made in his (God's) image and after his likeness.&quot;
The Adam, man, is not made in that likeness, nor is it so asserted
in the Bible. Moreover, the Second Adam [[Footnote continued on

<P>
The Secret Doctrine is not alone in speaking of primeval MEN born
simultaneously on the seven divisions of our Globe. In the <EM>Divine</EM>
&quot;<EM>Pymander</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>of Hermes we find the same
Seven primeval men* evolving from Nature and &quot;Heavenly Man,&quot;
in the collective sense of the word, namely, from the Creative
Spirits; and in the fragments (collected by George Smith) of Chaldean
tablets on which is inscribed the Babylonian Legend of Creation,
in the first column of the <EM>Cutha </EM>tablet, seven human
beings with the faces of ravens (black, swarthy complexions),
whom &quot;the (Seven) great gods created,&quot; are mentioned.
Or, as explained in lines 16 and 18 -- &quot;In the midst of the
Earth they grew up and became great . . . . Seven kings, brothers
of the same family.&quot; These are the Seven Kings of Edom to
whom reference is made in the Kabala; the first race, which was
<EM>imperfect, i.e., </EM>was born before the &quot;balance&quot;
(sexes) existed, and which was therefore destroyed. (Zohar, <EM>Siphrah
Dzeniouta, Idrah Suta,</EM> 2928,<EM> La Kabbale, </EM>p. 205.)
&quot;<EM>Seven Kings,</EM> brethren, appeared and begat children,
6,000 in number were their peoples&quot; (Hibbert Lectures, p.
372). The god Nergas (death) destroyed them. &quot;How did he
destroy them?&quot; &quot;By bringing into equilibrium (or balance)
those who did not yet exist&quot; (<EM>Siphrah Dzeniouta</EM>)<EM>.
</EM>They were &quot;destroyed,&quot; as a race, by being merged
in their own progeny (by exudation); that is to say, the sexless
race reincarnated in the bisexual

[[Footnote continued from previous page]] is esoterically a septenary
which represents seven men, or rather groups of men. For the first
Adam -- the Kadmon -- is the synthesis of the <EM>ten</EM> Sephiroth.
Of these, the upper triad remains in the Archetypal World as the
future &quot;Trinity,&quot; while the seven lower Sephiroth create
the manifested material world; and <EM>this septenate is the second
Adam. </EM>Genesis, and the mysteries upon which it was fabricated,
came from Egypt. The &quot;God&quot; of the 1st chapter of Genesis
is the <EM>Logos, </EM>and the &quot;Lord God&quot; of the 2nd
chapter the Creative <EM>Elohim</EM> -- the<EM> lower</EM> powers.
<P>
* Thus saith Pymander -- &quot;This is the mystery that to this
day was hidden. Nature being mingled with the Heavenly man (Elohim,
or Dhyanis), brought forth a wonder . . . . <EM>Seven men,</EM>
all males and females (Hermaphrodite) . . . according to the nature
of the seven Governors&quot; -- Book II. v. 29) -- or the seven
Hosts of the <EM>Pitris </EM>or Elohim, who projected or created
him. This is very clear, but yet, see the interpretations of even
our modern theologians, men supposed to be intellectual and learned!
In the &quot;<EM>Theological and philosophical works of Hermes
Trismegistus, Christian </EM>(<EM>?</EM>)<EM> Neoplatonist,</EM>&quot;<EM>
</EM>a work compiled by John David Chambers, of Oriel College,
Oxford, the translator wonders &quot;for whom these <EM>seven
men </EM>are intended?&quot; He solves the difficulty by concluding
that, as &quot;the original pattern man (<EM>Adam Kadmon of ch.</EM>
i.<EM> Genesis</EM>)<EM> </EM>was masculine-feminine, the seven
may signify the succeeding patriarchs named in Genesis&quot; (p.
9) . . . A truly theological way of cutting the Gordian knot.

(potentially); the latter in the Androgynes; these again in the
sexual, the later third Race; (for further explanation, <EM>vide
infra</EM>)<EM>. </EM>Were the tablets less mutilated, they would
be found to contain word for word the same account as given in
the archaic records and in Hermes, at least as regards the fundamental
facts, if not as regards minute details; for Hermes is a good
deal disfigured by mistranslations.
<P>
It is quite certain that the seeming supernaturalism of these
teachings, although allegorical, is so diametrically opposed to
the dead-letter statements of the Bible* as well as to the latest
hypotheses of science, that it will evoke passionate denial. The
Occultists, however, know that the traditions of Esoteric Philosophy
must be the right ones, simply because they are the most logical,
and reconcile every difficulty. Besides, we have the Egyptian
&quot;<EM>Books of Thoth,</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>and &quot;<EM>Book
of the Dead,</EM>&quot; and the Hindu Puranas with the seven Manus,
as well as the Chaldeo-Assyrian accounts, whose tiles mention
seven primitive men, or Adams, the real meaning of which name
may be ascertained through the Kabala. Those who know anything
of the Samothracian mysteries will also remember that the generic
name of the Kabiri was the &quot;Holy Fires,&quot; which created
on seven localities of the island of <EM>Electria </EM>(or Samothrace)
the &quot;Kabir born of the Holy Lemnos&quot; (the island sacred
to<EM> Vulcan</EM>).
<P>
According to Pindar (<EM>See </EM>&quot;<EM>Philosophumena,</EM>&quot;<EM>
Miller</EM>'<EM>s edition, p. </EM>98), this Kabir, whose name
was Adamas, was, in the traditions of Lemnos, the type of the
primitive man born from the bosom of the Earth. He was the Archetype
of the first males in the order of generation, and was one of
the seven autochthonous ancestors or progenitors of mankind (<EM>ibid,
p. </EM>108). If, while coupling with this the fact that Samothrace
was colonised by the Phoenicians, and before them by the mysterious
Pelasgians who came from the East, one remembers also the identity
of the<EM> mystery </EM>gods of the Phoenicians, Chaldeans, and
Israelites, it will be easy to discover whence came also the confused
account of the Noachian deluge. It has become undeniable of late
that the Jews, who obtained their primitive ideas about creation
from Moses, who had them from
<H6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
</H6>

<P>
* As it is now asserted that the Chaldean tablets, which give
the allegorical description of Creation, the Fall, and the Flood,
even to the legend of the Tower of Babel, were written &quot;before
the time of Moses&quot; (<EM>See G. Smith</EM>'<EM>s </EM>&quot;<EM>Chaldean
Account of Genesis,</EM>&quot; <EM>p</EM>. 86), how can the Pentateuch
be called a <EM>revelation? </EM>It is simply another version
of the same story.<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 4 THE SECRET DOCTRINE. </H6>

<P>
the Egyptians, compiled their Genesis and first Cosmogonic traditions
-- when these were rewritten by Ezra and others -- from the Chaldeo-Akkadian
account. It is, therefore, sufficient to examine the Babylonian
and Assyrian cuneiform and other inscriptions to find also therein,
scattered here and there, not only the original meaning of the
name Adam, Admi, or Adami,* but also the creation of seven Adams
or roots of men, born of Mother Earth, physically, and of the
<EM>divine fire </EM>of the progenitors, spiritually or astrally.
The Assyriologists, ignorant of the esoteric teachings, could
hardly be expected to pay any greater attention to the mysterious
and ever-recurring number seven on the Babylonian cylinders, than
they paid to it on finding the same in Genesis and the Bible.
Yet the number of the ancestral spirits and their seven groups
of human progeny are there, notwithstanding the dilapidated condition
of the fragments, as plainly as they are to be found in<EM> </EM>&quot;<EM>Pymander</EM>&quot;<EM>
</EM>and in the &quot;<EM>Book of the Concealed Mystery</EM>&quot;<EM>
</EM>of the Kabala. In the latter Adam Kadmon is the Sephirothal
TREE, as also the &quot;Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil.&quot;
And that &quot;<EM>Tree,</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>says verse 32, &quot;hath
around it seven columns,&quot; or palaces, of the seven creative
Angels operating in the spheres of the seven planets on our Globe.
As Adam Kadmon is a <EM>collective </EM>name, so also is the name
of the man Adam. Says George Smith<EM> </EM>in his<EM> </EM>&quot;<EM>Chaldean
Account of Genesis</EM>:&quot; --
<P>
&quot;The word Adam used in these legends for the first human
being is evidently <EM>not a proper name, but is only used as
a term for mankind. </EM>Adam appears as a proper name in Genesis,
but certainly in some passages is only used in the same sense
as the Assyrian word&quot; (<I>p.</I> 86).
<P>
Moreover, neither the Chaldean nor the Biblical deluge (the stories
of Xisuthrus and Noah) is based on the universal or even on the
Atlantean deluges, recorded in the Indian allegory of Vaivaswata
Manu. They are the <EM>exoteric allegories based on the esoteric
mysteries </EM>of Samothrace. If the older Chaldees knew the esoteric
truth concealed in the Puranic legends, the other nations were
aware only of the Samothracian mystery, and allegorised it. They
adapted it to their astronomical and anthropological, or rather
phallic, notions. Samothrace is known <EM>historically </EM>to
have been famous in antiquity for a deluge, which submerged the
country and reached the top of the highest mountains; an event
which happened before the age of the Argonauts. It was overflowed

<P>
suddenly by the waters of the Euxine, regarded up to that time
as a lake.* But the Israelites had, moreover, another legend upon
which to base their allegory: the &quot;deluge,&quot; that transformed
the present Gobi Desert into a sea <EM>for the last time, </EM>some
10 or 12,000 years ago, and which drove many Noahs and their families
on to the surrounding mountains. As the Babylonian accounts are
now only restored from hundreds of thousands of broken fragments
(the mound of <EM>Kouyunjik </EM>alone having yielded to Layard's
excavations over twenty thousand fragments of inscriptions), the
proofs here cited are comparatively scanty; yet such as they are,
they corroborate almost every one of our teachings, certainly
three, at least. These are: --
<P>
(1.) That the race which was the first to fall into generation
was a <EM>dark Race </EM>(<EM>Zalmat Gaguadi</EM>)<EM>, </EM>which
they call the <EM>Adami </EM>or dark Race, and that <EM>Sarku,
</EM>or the light Race, remained pure for a long while subsequently.
<P>
(2.) That the Babylonians recognised <EM>two principal Races </EM>at
the time of the Fall, the Race of the Gods (the Ethereal <EM>doubles
of the Pitris</EM>), having preceded these two. This is Sir H.
Rawlinson's opinion. These &quot;Races&quot; are our second and
third Root-races.
<P>
(3) That these seven Gods, each of whom created a <EM>man, </EM>or
group of men, were &quot;the gods <EM>imprisoned </EM>or incarnated.&quot;
These gods were: the god <EM>Zi; </EM>the god <EM>Ziku </EM>(noble
life, Director of purity); the god <EM>Mirku</EM> (noble crown)
&quot;Saviour from death of the gods&quot; (later on) imprisoned,
and the creator of &quot;the dark Race which his hand has made;&quot;
the god <EM>Libzu </EM>&quot;wise among the gods&quot;; the god
<EM>Nissi . </EM>. . . and the god <EM>Suhhab;</EM> and <EM>Hea</EM>
or <EM>Sa, </EM>their synthesis, the god of wisdom and of the
Deep, identified with Oannes-Dagon, at the time of the fall, and
called (collectively) the Demiurge, or Creator. (<EM>See Chaldean
Account Genesis, </EM>p. 82.)
<P>
There are two &quot;Creations&quot; so called, in the Babylonian
fragments, and <EM>Genesis </EM>having adhered to this, one finds
its first two chapters distinguished as the Elohite and the Jehovite
creations. Their proper order, however, is not preserved in these
or in any other exoteric accounts. Now these &quot;Creations,&quot;
according to the occult teachings, refer respectively to the formation
of the primordial seven <EM>men </EM>by the progenitors (the Pitris,
or Elohim): and to that of the human groups after the fall.
<H6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------

7, c. 4, etc.<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 6 THE SECRET DOCTRINE. </H6>

<P>
All this will be examined in the light of science and comparisons
drawn from the scriptures of all the ancient nations, the Bible
included, as we proceed. Meanwhile, before we turn to the <EM>Anthropogenesis
</EM>of the prehistoric Races, it may be useful to agree upon
the names to be given to the Continents on which the four great
Races, which preceded our <EM>Adamic</EM> Race, were born, lived,
and died. Their archaic and esoteric names were many, and varied
with the language of the nationality which mentioned them in its
annals and scriptures. That which in the Vendidad, for instance,
is referred to as Airyanem Vaego (<EM>see</EM> <EM>Bund. </EM>79,
12) wherein was born the original Zoroaster,* is called in the
Puranic literature &quot;Sveta-Dwipa,&quot; &quot;Mount Meru,&quot;
the abode of Vishnu, etc., etc.; and in the Secret Doctrine is
simply named the land of the &quot;Gods&quot; under their chiefs
the &quot;Spirits of this Planet.&quot;
<P>
Therefore, in view of the possible, and even very probable confusion,
that may arise, it is considered more convenient to adopt, for
each of the four Continents constantly referred to, a name more
familiar to the cultured reader. It is proposed, then, to call
the first continent, or rather the first <EM>terra firma </EM>on
which the first Race was evolved by the divine progenitors: --
<P>
I. &quot;The Imperishable Sacred Land.&quot;
<P>
The reasons for this name are explained as follows: This &quot;Sacred
Land&quot; -- of which more later on -- is stated never to have
shared the fate of the other continents; because it is the only
one whose destiny it is to last from the beginning to the end
of the Manvantara throughout each Round. It is the cradle of the
first man and the dwelling of the last <EM>divine </EM>mortal,
chosen as a <EM>Sishta </EM>for the future seed of humanity. Of
this mysterious and sacred land very little can be said, except,
perhaps, according to a poetical expression in one of the Commentaries,
that the &quot;pole-star has its watchful eye upon it, from the
dawn to the close of the twilight of 'a day' of the GREAT BREATH.&quot;**
<H6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
</H6>

<P>
* By &quot;original&quot; we mean the &quot;Amshaspend,&quot;
called &quot;Zarathustra, the lord and ruler of the Vara made
by Yima in that land.&quot; There were several Zarathustra or
Zertusts, the Dabistan alone enumerating thirteen; but these were
all the reincarnations of the first one. The last Zoroaster was
the founder of the Fire temple of Azareksh and the writer of the
works on the primeval sacred Magian religion destroyed by Alexander.
<P>
** In India called &quot;The Day of Brahma.&quot; <HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 7 HYPERBOREAS AND LEMURIA.</H6>

<P>
II. The &quot;<STRONG>H</STRONG>YPERBOREAN&quot; will be the name
chosen for the Second Continent, the land which stretched out
its promontories southward and westward from the North Pole to
receive the Second Race, and comprised the whole of what is now
known as Northern Asia. Such was the name given by the oldest
Greeks to the far-off and mysterious region, whither their tradition
made Apollo the &quot;Hyperborean&quot; travel every year. <EM>Astronomically,
</EM>Apollo is of course the Sun, who, abandoning his Hellenic
sanctuaries, loved to visit annually his far-away country, where
the Sun was said never to set for one half of the year. [[<EM>Eggus
gar nuktos te kai ematos eisi keleuthoi</EM>]], says a verse in
the <EM>Odyssey </EM>(x. 86).
<P>
But<EM> historically, </EM>or better, perhaps, ethnologically
and geologically, the meaning is different. The land of the Hyperboreans,
the country that extended beyond Boreas, the frozen-hearted god
of snows and hurricanes, who loved to slumber heavily on the chain
of Mount Riphaeus, was neither an ideal country, as surmised by
the mythologists, nor yet a land in the neighbourhood of Scythia
and the Danube.* It was a real Continent, a <EM>bona-fide </EM>land
which knew no winter in those early days, nor have its sorry remains
more than one night and day during the year, even now. The nocturnal
shadows never fall upon it, said the Greeks; for it is the <EM>land
of the Gods, </EM>the favourite abode of Apollo, the god of light,
and its inhabitants are his beloved priests and servants. This
may be regarded as poetised <EM>fiction</EM> now; but it was poetised
<EM>truth</EM> then.
<P>
III. The third Continent, we propose to call &quot;Lemuria.&quot;
The name is an invention, or an idea, of Mr. P. L. Sclater, who
asserted, between 1850 and 1860, on zoological grounds the actual
existence, in prehistoric times, of a Continent which he showed
to have extended from Madagascar to Ceylon and Sumatra. It included
some portions of what is now Africa; but otherwise this gigantic
Continent, which stretched from the Indian ocean to Australia,
has now wholly disappeared beneath the waters of the Pacific,
leaving here and there only some of its highland tops which are
now islands. Mr. A. R. Wallace, the naturalist, &quot;extends
the Australia of tertiary periods to New Guinea and the Solomon
Islands, and perhaps to Fiji;&quot; and from its Marsupial types
he infers &quot;a connection with the Northern Continent during
the

Secondary period,&quot; writes Mr. C. Gould in &quot;<EM>Mythical
Monsters,</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>p. 47. The subject is treated at
length elsewhere.*
<P>
IV. &quot;Atlantis&quot; is the Fourth Continent. It would be
the first historical land, were the traditions of the ancients
to receive more attention than they have hitherto. The famous
island of Plato of that name was but a fragment of this great
Continent. (<EM>See </EM>&quot;<EM>Esoteric</EM> <EM>Buddhism.</EM>&quot;)
<P>
V. The Fifth Continent was America; but, as it is situated at
the Antipodes, it is Europe and Asia Minor, almost coeval with
it, which are generally referred to by the Indo-Aryan Occultists
as the fifth. If their teaching followed the appearance of the
Continents in their geological and geographical order, then this
classification would have to be altered. But as the sequence of
the Continents is made to follow the order of evolution of the
Races, from the first to the fifth, our Aryan Root-race, Europe
must be called the fifth great Continent. The Secret Doctrine
takes no account of islands and peninsulas, nor does it follow
the modern geographical distribution of land and sea. Since the
day of its earliest teachings and the destruction of the great
Atlantis, the face of the earth has changed more than once. There
was a time when the delta of Egypt and Northern Africa belonged
to Europe, before the formation of the Straits of Gibraltar, and
a further upheaval of the continent, changed entirely the face
of the map of Europe. The last serious change occurred some 12,000
years ago,**
<H6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
</H6>

<P>
* It is to be remarked, however, that Mr. Wallace does not accept
Mr. Sclater's idea, and even opposes it. Mr. Sclater supposes
a land or continent formerly uniting Africa, Madagascar, and India
(but not Australia and India); and Mr. A. R. Wallace shows, in
his &quot;<EM>Geographical Distribution of Animals</EM>&quot;<EM>
</EM>and &quot;<EM>Island Life,</EM>&quot; that the hypothesis
of such a land is quite uncalled for on the alleged zoological
grounds. But he admits that a much closer proximity of India and
Australia did certainly exist, and at a time so very remote that
it was &quot;certainly pre-tertiary,&quot; and he adds in a private
letter that &quot;no name has been given to this supposed land.&quot;
Yet the land did exist, and was of course <EM>pre-tertiary, </EM>for
&quot;Lemuria&quot; (accepting this name for the third Continent)
had perished before Atlantis had fully developed; and the latter
sunk and its chief portions had disappeared before the end of
the Miocene period.
<P>
** One more &quot;coincidence&quot; --
<P>
&quot;Now it is proved that in geologically recent times, <EM>this
region of North Africa was in</EM> <EM>fact a peninsula of Spain,
</EM>and that its union with Africa (proper) was effected on the
North by the rupture of Gibraltar, and on the South by an <EM>upheaval
to which the Sahara</EM> <EM>owes its existence. </EM>The shores
of this former sea of Sahara are still marked by the shells [[Footnote
continued on next page]] <HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 9 PRE-TERTIARY GIANTS.</H6>

<P>
and was followed by the submersion of Plato's little Atlantic
island, which he calls Atlantis after its parent continent. Geography
was part of the mysteries, in days of old. Says the <EM>Zohar
</EM>(iii., fol. 10<EM>a</EM>): &quot;These secrets (of land and
sea) were divulged <EM>to the men of the secret science</EM>,
but not to the geographers.&quot;
<P>
The claim that physical man was originally a colossal pre-tertiary
giant, and that he existed 18,000,000 years ago, must of course
appear preposterous to admirers of, and believers in, modern learning.
The whole <EM>posse comitatis </EM>of biologists will turn away
from the conception of this third race Titan of the Secondary
age, a being fit to fight as successfully with the then gigantic
monsters of the air, sea, and land, as his forefathers -- the
ethereal prototype of the Atlantean -- had little need to fear
that which could not hurt him. The modern anthropologist is quite
welcome to laugh at our Titans, as he laughs at the Biblical Adam,
and as the theologian laughs at his pithecoid ancestor. The Occultists
and their severe critics may feel that they have pretty well mutually
squared their accounts by this time. Occult sciences claim less
and give more, at all events, than either Darwinian Anthropology
or Biblical Theology.
<P>
Nor ought the Esoteric Chronology to frighten any one; for, with
regard to figures, the greatest authorities of the day are as
fickle and as uncertain as the Mediterranean wave. As regards
the duration of the geological periods alone, the learned men
of the Royal Society are all hopelessly at sea, and jump from
one million to five hundred millions of years with the utmost
ease, as will be seen more than once during this comparison.
<P>
Take one instance for our present purpose -- the calculations
of Mr. Croll. Whether, according to this authority, 2,500,000
years represent the time since the beginning of the tertiary age,
or the Eocene period, as an American geologist makes him say;*
or whether again Mr. Croll &quot;allows fifteen millions since
the beginning of the Eocene period,&quot; as quoted by an English
geologist,** both sets of figures cover the claims

made by the Secret Doctrine.* For assigning as the latter does
from four to five million years between the incipient and the
final evolution of the Fourth Root-Race, on the Lemuro-Atlantean
Continents; one million years for the Fifth, or Aryan Race, to
the present date; and about 850,000 since the submersion of the
last large peninsula of the great Atlantis -- all this may have
easily taken place within the 15,000,000 years conceded by Mr.
Croll to the Tertiary Age. But, <EM>chronologically </EM>speaking,
the duration of the period is of secondary importance, as we have,
after all, certain American scientists to fall back upon. These
gentlemen, unmoved by the fact that their assertions are called
not only dubious but absurd, yet maintain that man existed so
far back as in the Secondary Age. They have found human footprints
on rocks of that formation; and furthermore, M. de Quatrefages
finds no valid <EM>scientific </EM>reason why man should not have
existed during the Secondary Age.
<P>
The &quot;Ages&quot; and periods in geology are, in sober truth,
purely conventional terms, as they are still hardly delineated,
and, moreover,

<P>
* Sir Charles Lyell, who is credited with having &quot;<EM>happily
</EM>invented the terms Eocene, Miocene, and Pliocene,&quot; to
mark the three divisions of the Tertiary age, ought really to
have settled upon some approximate age for his &quot;Mind-offspring.&quot;
Having left the duration of these periods, however, to the speculations
of specialists, the greatest confusion and perplexity are the
result of that happy thought. It seems like a hopeless task to
quote one set of figures from one work, without the risk of finding
it contradicted by the same Author in an earlier or a subsequent
volume. Sir W. Thomson, one of the most eminent among the modern
authorities, has changed, about half-a-dozen times, his opinion
upon the age of the Sun and the date of the consolidation of the
Earth's crust. In Thomson and Tait's &quot;<EM>Natural Philosophy,</EM>&quot;<EM>
</EM>one finds only ten million years allowed, since the time
when the temperature of the Earth permitted vegetable life to
appear on it; (<EM>App. D et seq. also Trans. Roy. Soc. Edin.
</EM>xxiii, <EM>Pt.</EM> 1, 157, 1862, where 847 is cancelled).
Mr. Darwin gives Sir W. Thomson's estimate as &quot;a minimum
of 98 and a maximum of 200 millions of years since the consolidation
of the crust&quot; (See Ch. Gould). In the same work (<EM>Nat.
Phil.</EM>)<EM> </EM>80 millions are given from the time of incipient
incrustation to the present state of the world. And in his last
lecture, as shown elsewhere, Sir W. Thomson declares (1887) that
the Sun is not older than 15 <EM>millions </EM>of years! Meanwhile,
basing his arguments as to the limits to the age of the Sun's
heat, on figures previously established by Sir W. Thomson, Mr.
Croll allows 60<EM> millions </EM>of years since the beginning
of the Cambrian period. This is hopeful for the lovers of <EM>exact
</EM>knowledge. Thus, whatever figures are given by Occult Science,
they are sure to be corroborated by those of some one among the
modern men of Science who are considered as authorities.<HR>

<P>
[[Vol. 2, Page]] 11 THE TROPICS AT THE POLE.
<P>
no two geologists or naturalists agree as to the figures. Thus,
there is a wide margin for choice offered to the Occultist by
the learned fraternity. Shall we take for one of our supports
Mr. T. Mellard Reade? This gentleman, in a paper on &quot;Limestone
as an Index of Geological Time,&quot; read by him in 1878 before
the Royal Society, claims that the <EM>minimum </EM>time required
for the formation of the sedimentary <EM>strata</EM> and the elimination
of the calcareous matter is in round numbers 600 million years
(<EM>See </EM>&quot;<EM>Proceedings of Royal Society,</EM>&quot;<EM>
London, </EM>Vol.<STRONG> </STRONG><B>XXVIII</B>., p. 281); or
shall we ask support for our chronology from Mr. Darwin's works,
wherein he demands for the organic transformations according to
his theory from 300 to 500 million years? Sir C. Lyell and Prof.
Houghton were satisfied with placing the beginning of the Cambrian
Age at 200 and 240 millions of years back respectively. Geologists
and zoologists claim the maximum time, though Mr. Huxley, at one
time, placed the beginning of the incrustation of the earth 1,000
million years ago, and would not surrender a millennium of it.
<P>
But the main point for us lies not in the agreement or disagreement
of the Naturalists as to the duration of geological periods, but
rather in their perfect accord on one point, for a wonder, and
this a very important one. They all agree that during &quot;The
Miocene Age&quot; -- whether one or ten million years ago -- Greenland
and even Spitzbergen, the remnants of our Second or Hyperborean
Continent, &quot;had <EM>almost a tropical climate.</EM>&quot;<EM>
</EM>Now the pre-Homeric Greeks had preserved a vivid tradition
of this &quot;Land of the Eternal Sun,&quot; whither their Apollo
journeyed yearly. &quot;During the Miocene Age, Greenland (in
N. Lat. 70 degrees) developed an abundance of trees, such as the
Yew, the Redwood, the Sequoia, allied to the Californian species,
Beeches, Planes, Willows, Oaks, Poplars and Walnuts, as well as
a Magnolia and a Zamia,&quot; says Science; in short Greenland
had Southern plants unknown to Northern regions.
<P>
And now this natural question rises. If the Greeks knew, in the
days of Homer, of a Hyperborean land,<EM> i.e.,</EM> a blessed
land beyond the reach of Boreas, the god of winter and of the
hurricane, an ideal region which the later Greeks and their classics
have vainly tried to locate by searching for it beyond Scythia,
a country where nights were short and days long, and beyond that
land a country where the sun never set and the palm grew freely
-- if they knew of all this, who then told them of it? In<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 12 THE SECRET DOCTRINE. </H6>

<P>
their day, and for ages previously, Greenland must certainly have
been already covered with perpetual snows, with never-thawing
ice, just as it is now. Everything tends to show that the land
of the short nights and the long days was Norway or Scandinavia,
<EM>beyond </EM>which was the blessed land of eternal light and
summer; and to know of this, their tradition must have descended
to the Greeks from some people more ancient than themselves, who
were acquainted with those climatic details of which the Greeks
themselves could know nothing. Even in our day, science suspects
beyond the Polar seas, at the very circle of the Arctic Pole,
the existence of a sea which never freezes and a continent which
is ever green. The archaic teachings, and likewise the Puranas
-- for one who understands the allegories of the latter -- contain
the same statements. Suffice, then, to us the strong probability
that a people, now unknown to history, lived during the Miocene
period of modern science, at a time when Greenland was an almost
tropical land.
