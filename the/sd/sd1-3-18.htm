SUMMARY OF THE MUTUAL POSITION.</H4>

<P>
<STRONG>T</STRONG>HE reader has had the whole case presented to
him from both sides, and it remains with him to decide whether
its summary stands in our favour or not. If there were such a
thing as void, a <EM>vacuum </EM>in Nature, one would find it
produced, according to a physical law, in the minds of helpless
admirers of the &quot;lights&quot; of science, who pass their
time in mutually destroying their teachings. If ever the theory
that &quot;two lights make darkness&quot; found its application
it is in this case, when one half of the &quot;lights&quot; imposes
its Forces and &quot;modes of motion&quot; on the belief of the
faithful, and the other half opposes the very existence of the
same. &quot;Ether, Matter, Energy&quot; -- the sacred hypostatical
trinity, the three principles of the truly <EM>unknown </EM>God
of Science, called by them <STRONG>P</STRONG>HYSICAL <STRONG>N</STRONG>ATURE!
<P>
Theology is taken to task and ridiculed for believing in the union
of three persons in one Godhead -- one God as to substance, three
persons as to individuality; and we are laughed at for our belief
in unproved and unprovable doctrines, in Angels and Devils, Gods
and Spirits. And,<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 669 THE EXACT SCIENCES OF -- NEGATION.</H6>

<P>
indeed, that which made the Scientists win the day over Theology
in the Great &quot;Conflict between Religion and Science,&quot;
was precisely the argument that neither the identity of that substance,
nor the triple individuality claimed, after having been conceived,
invented, and worked out in the depths of Theological Consciousness,
could be proved by any Scientific inductive process of reasoning,
least of all on the evidence of our senses. Religion must perish,
it is said, because it teaches <EM>mysteries. Mystery is the negation
of Common Sense</EM>,<EM> </EM>and Science repels it. According
to Mr. Tyndall, metaphysics is <EM>fiction</EM>,<EM> </EM>like
poetry. The man of Science <EM>takes nothing on trust; </EM>rejects
everything <EM>that is not proven to him</EM>,<EM> </EM>while
the Theologian accepts <EM>everything on blind faith. </EM>The
Theosophist and the Occultist, who take nothing on trust, not
even <EM>exact </EM>Science, the Spiritualist who denies dogma
but believes in Spirits and in <EM>invisible but potential influences</EM>,<EM>
</EM>all share in the same contempt. Very well, then; what we
have to do now, is to examine for the last time whether <EM>exact
</EM>Science does not act precisely in the same way as Theosophy,
Spiritualism, and Theology do.
<P>
In a work by Mr. S. Laing, considered a standard book on Science,
&quot;Modern Science and Modern Thought,&quot; the author of which,
according to the laudatory review of the <EM>Times</EM>,<EM> </EM>&quot;exhibits
with much power and effect the immense discoveries of Science,
and its numerous victories over old opinions, whenever THEY HAVE
THE RASHNESS TO CHALLENGE CONCLUSIONS WITH IT,&quot; one reads
in chapter <B>III.</B>, &quot;On Matter,&quot; as follows:
<P>
&quot;<STRONG>W</STRONG>HAT IS THE MATERIAL UNIVERSE COMPOSED
OF? <STRONG>ETHER</STRONG>, <STRONG>MATTER</STRONG>, <STRONG>ENERGY&quot;</STRONG>
. . . . . is the answer.
<P>
We stop to ask, &quot;What is Ether?&quot; And Mr. Laing answers
in the name of Science: --
<P>
&quot;<EM>Ether is not actually known to us </EM>BY ANY TEST OF
WHICH THE SENSES CAN TAKE COGNIZANCE, <EM>but is a</EM> <EM>sort
of mathematical substance which </EM>WE ARE COMPELLED TO ASSUME
<EM>in order to account for the phenomena of light and heat.</EM>&quot;
<P>
And [[sic]] what is matter? Do you know more about it than you
do about the &quot;hypothetical&quot; agent, Ether?
<P>
&quot;<EM>In perfect strictness</EM>,<EM> it is true that chemical
investigations can tell us </EM>. . . . NOTHING DIRECTLY <EM>of
the composition of living matter</EM>,<EM> and </EM>. . . . <EM>it
is also in strictness true</EM>,<EM> </EM>THAT WE KNOW NOTHING
<EM>about the composition of </EM>ANY<EM> </EM>(<EM>material</EM>)<EM>
</EM>BODY WHATEVER AS IT IS.&quot; (<EM>Lecture on Protoplasm
by Mr. Huxley.</EM>)
<P>
And Energy? Surely you can define the third person of the Trinity
of your Material universe?
<P>
&quot;<STRONG>T</STRONG>HE <STRONG>E</STRONG>NERGY IS THAT WHICH
IS ONLY KNOWN TO US BY ITS EFFECTS<EM>.</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>(<EM>Books
on Physics.</EM>)
<P>
Pray explain, for this is rather hazy.

TO THE NATURE OF MOLECULAR <B>E</B>NERGY OR <B>F</B>ORCES, THE
VARIOUS PHENOMENA WHICH BODIES PRESENT SHOW THAT THEIR MOLECULES
ARE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF TWO CONTRARY FORCES -- ONE WHICH TENDS
TO BRING THEM TOGETHER, THE OTHER TO SEPARATE THEM. . . . . <B>T</B>HE
FIRST IS MOLECULAR ATTRACTION, THE SECOND FORCE IS DUE TO <EM>vis
viva</EM>,<EM> </EM>OR MOVING FORCE.&quot; . . . <EM>. </EM>(<EM>Ganot's
Physics</EM>.)
<P>
Just so: it is the nature of this <EM>moving force</EM>,<EM> </EM>the<EM>
vis viva </EM>that we want to know. What is it? . . . . .
<P>
&quot;<STRONG>WE DO NOT KNOW</STRONG>!&quot; IS THE INVARIABLE
ANSWER. &quot;<B>I</B>T IS AN EMPTY SHADOW OF MY IMAGINATION,&quot;
explains Mr. Huxley in his <EM>Physical Basis of Life.</EM> 
<P>
Thus the whole structure of Modern Science is built on a kind
of &quot;mathematical abstraction,&quot; on a Protean &quot;Substance
which eludes the senses,&quot; (Dubois Reymond,) and on <EM>effects</EM>,<EM>
</EM>the shadowy and illusive will-o'-the-wisps of a <EM>something
</EM>entirely unknown to and beyond the reach of Science, &quot;<EM>Self</EM>-<EM>moving</EM>&quot;<EM>
</EM>atoms!<EM> Self</EM>-<EM>moving </EM>Suns, planets, and stars!
But who, then, or <EM>what </EM>are they all, if they are self-endowed
with motion? Why then should you, physicists, laugh and deride
our &quot;Self-moving <EM>ARCHAEUS&quot;? </EM>Mystery is rejected
and scorned by Science, and<EM> </EM>&quot;<EM>MYSTERY is the
fatality of Science</EM>,&quot;<EM> </EM>as Father Felix has truly
said. . . . . Science <EM>cannot </EM>escape it!&quot; The language
of the French preacher is <EM>ours</EM>,<EM> </EM>and we quote
it in &quot;<EM>Isis Unveiled</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>(<EM>Vide </EM>Vol.
I. 338-9). Who -- he asks -- who of you, men of Science:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;. . . . has been able to penetrate the secret of the formation
of a body, the generation of a single atom? What is there, I will
not say at the centre of a sun, but at the centre of an atom?
Who has sounded to the bottom the abyss in a grain of sand? The
grain of sand, gentlemen, has been studied four thousand years
by science, she has turned and returned it; she divides it and
subdivides it; she torments it with her experiments; she vexes
it with her questions to snatch from it the final word as to its
secret constitution; she asks it, with an insatiable curiosity:
'Shall I divide thee infinitesimally?' Then suspended over this
abyss, science hesitates, she stumbles, she feels dazzled, she
becomes dizzy, and in despair says: <STRONG><I>I DO NOT KNOW</I></STRONG><I>.</I>&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;But if you are so fatally ignorant of the genesis and hidden
nature of a grain of sand, how should you have an intuition as
to the generation of a single living being? Whence in the living
being does life come? Where does it commence? What is the life
principle?&quot;*
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Do the men of science deny all these charges? Not at all, for
here is a confession of Tyndall, which shows how powerless is
science, even over the world of matter.

baffles a keener power than that of the microscope.&quot; &quot;Through
pure excess of complexity, and long before observation can have
any voice in the matter, the most highly trained intellect, the
most refined and disciplined imagination, <I>retires in bewilderment
from the contemplation of the problem. </I>We are struck dumb
by an astonishment which no microscope can relieve, doubting not
only the power of our instrument, but even whether we ourselves
possess the intellectual elements which will ever enable us to
grapple with the ultimate structural energies of nature.&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
How little is known of the material universe, indeed, has now
been suspected for years, on the very admissions of these men
of science themselves. And now there are some materialists who
would even make away with Ether -- or whatever Science calls the
infinite Substance, the noumenon of which the Buddhists call Swabhavat
-- as well as with atoms, too dangerous both on account of their
ancient philosophical and their present Christian and theological
associations. From the earliest philosophers whose records passed
to posterity, down to our present age, which, if it denies &quot;invisible
Beings&quot; in Space, can never be so insane as to deny a <EM>plenum
</EM>of some sort -- the<EM> fulness </EM>of the universe was
an accepted belief. And what it was said to contain, one learns
from Hermes Trismegistus (in Mrs. Kingsford's able rendering)
-- who is made to say: --
<P>
&quot;Concerning the void . . . my judgment is that it does not
exist, that it never existed, and that it never will exist, for
all the various parts of the universe are filled, as the earth
also is complete and full of bodies, differing in quality and
in form, having their species and their magnitude, one larger,
one smaller, one solid, one tenuous. The larger . . . are easily
perceived; the smaller . . . are difficult to apprehend, or altogether
invisible. We know only of their existence by the sensation of
feeling, wherefore <EM>many persons deny such entities to be bodies</EM>,<EM>
and regard them as simply spaces</EM>,*<EM> </EM>but it is impossible
there should be such spaces. For if indeed there should be anything
outside the universe . . . then it would be a space occupied by
intelligent beings analogous to its (the universe's) divinity
. . . . . . I speak of the genii, for I hold they dwell with us,
and of the heroes who dwell above us, between the earth and the
highest airs; wherein are neither clouds nor any tempest&quot;
(p. 84).
<P>
And we &quot;hold&quot; it too. Only, as already remarked, no
Eastern Initiate would speak of spheres &quot;<EM>above </EM>us,
between the earth and the
<H6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
</H6>

<P>
* Behold the work of Cycles and their periodical return! Those
who denied such &quot;Entities&quot; (Forces) to be bodies, and
called them &quot;Spaces,&quot; were the prototypes of our modern
&quot;Science-struck&quot; public, and their official teachers,
who speak of the Forces of nature as the imponderable energy of
matter and modes of motion, and yet bold electricity (for one)
as being as <EM>atomic as matter </EM>itself -- (Helmholtz). Inconsistency
and contradiction reign as much in official as in heterodox Science.
<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 672 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</H6>

<P>
airs,&quot; even the highest, as there is no such division or
measurement in <EM>occult </EM>speech, no &quot;<EM>above</EM>&quot;<EM>
</EM>as no &quot;<EM>below</EM>,&quot;<EM> </EM>but an eternal
&quot;within,&quot; <EM>within two other withins</EM>,<EM> </EM>or
the planes of subjectivity merging gradually into that of terrestrial
objectivity -- this being for <EM>man </EM>the last one, his own
plane. This necessary explanation may be closed here by giving,
in the words of Hermes, the belief on this particular point of
the whole world of mystics: --
<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;There are many orders of the gods; and in all there is an
intelligent part. It is not to be supposed they do not come within
the range of our senses; on the contrary, we perceive them, better
even than those which are called visible. . . There are then gods,
superior to all appearances; after them come the gods whose principle
is spiritual; these gods being sensible, in conformity with their
double origin, <I>manifest all things </I>by a sensible nature,
each of them illuminating his works one by another.* The Supreme
Being of Heaven, or of all that is comprehended under this name,
is Zeus, for it is by Heaven that Zeus gives life to all things.
The Supreme Being of <I>the Sun</I> <I>is Light</I>,<I> </I>for
it is by the disk of the Sun that we receive the benefit of the
light. The thirty-six horoscopes of the fixed stars have for supreme
Being or Prince, him whose name is <I>Pantomorphos</I>,<I> </I>or
having all forms, because he gives divine forms to divers types.
The seven planets, or wandering spheres, have for Supreme Spirits
Fortune and Destiny, who uphold the eternal stability of the laws
of nature throughout incessant transformation and perpetual agitation.
The ether is the instrument or medium by which all is produced.&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
This is quite philosophical and in accordance with the spirit
of Eastern esotericism: for all the Forces, such as Light, Heat,
Electricity, etc., etc., are called the &quot;Gods&quot; -- esoterically.
<P>
It must be so, since the esoteric teachings in Egypt and India
were identical. And, therefore, the personification of <EM>Fohat
</EM>synthesizing all the manifesting forces in nature is a legitimate
result. Moreover, as will be shown in the division that follows
this one, the real and <EM>Occult </EM>forces in nature only now
begin to be known -- and even in this case, by heterodox, not
orthodox, Science (<EM>See also </EM>&#167; X., <STRONG>T</STRONG>HE
<STRONG>C</STRONG>OMING <STRONG>F</STRONG>ORCE), though their
existence, in one instance at any rate, is corroborated, and certified
to by an immense number of educated people and even by some official
men of science.
<P>
This sentence, moreover, in Stanza <B>VI</B>., &quot;Fohat sets
in motion the primordial World-germs, or the aggregation of Cosmic
atoms and matter, some one way, some another, in the opposite
direction&quot; -- looks orthodox and Scientific enough. For there
is, at all events, one fact in support of this position fully
recognized by Science, and it is this. The meteoric showers (periodical
in November and August) belong to
<H6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
</H6>

<P>
* &quot;Hermes here includes as gods the <EM>sensible Forces </EM>of
nature, the elements and the phenomena of the Universe,&quot;
remarks Mrs. A. Kingsford in a foot-note explaining it very correctly.
So does Eastern philosophy.<HR>

<P>
a system moving in an elliptical orbit around the Sun. The aphelion
of this ring is 1,732 millions of miles beyond the orbit of Neptune,
its plane is inclined to the Earth's orbit at an angle of 64 [[degrees]]
3', and the direction of the meteoric swarm moving round this
orbit <EM>is contrary to that of the Earth</EM>'<EM>s revolution.</EM>

<P>
This fact, recognized only in 1833, shows it to be the modern
rediscovery of what was very anciently known. <EM>Fohat </EM>turns
with his two hands in contrary directions the &quot;seed&quot;
and &quot;the curds,&quot; or Cosmic matter; is turning, in clearer
language, particles in a highly attenuated condition, and nebulae.
<P>
Outside the boundaries of the solar system, it is other Suns,
and especially the mysterious &quot;central Sun&quot; (the &quot;Abode
of the invisible deity&quot; as some reverend gentlemen have called
it) that determines the motion of bodies and their direction.
That motion serves also to differentiate the homogeneous matter,
round and between the several bodies, into elements and sub-elements
unknown to our earth, which are regarded by modern Science as
distinct individual elements, whereas they are merely temporary
appearances, changing with every small cycle within the Manvantara,
some Esoteric works calling them &quot;Kalpic Masks.&quot;
<P>
<EM>Fohat </EM>is the key in Occultism which opens and unriddles
the multiform symbols and respective allegories in the so-called
mythology of every nation; demonstrating the wonderful philosophy
and the deep insight into the mysteries of nature, in the Egyptian
and Chaldean as well as in the Aryan religions. Fohat, shown in
his true character, proves how deeply versed were all those prehistoric
nations in every science of nature, now called physical and chemical
branches of natural philosophy. In India, Fohat is the scientific
aspect of both Vishnu and Indra, the latter older and more important
in the Rig Veda than his sectarian successor; while in Egypt Fohat
was known as Toum issued of Noot,* or Osiris in his character
of a primordial god, creator of heaven and of beings (see chapter
xvii., &quot;<EM>Book of the Dead</EM>&quot;)<EM>. </EM>For<EM>
Toum </EM>is spoken of as the <EM>Protean </EM>god who <EM>generates
other gods </EM>and gives himself the form he likes; the &quot;master
of life&quot; &quot;giving their vigour to the gods&quot; (chapter
lxxix.) He is the <EM>overseer </EM>of the gods, and he &quot;who
creates spirits and gives them shape and life&quot;; he is &quot;the
<EM>north wind </EM>and the <EM>spirit of the west</EM>;&quot;<EM>
</EM>and finally the &quot;Setting Sun of Life,&quot; or the vital
electric force that leaves the body at death, wherefore the <EM>defunct
</EM>begs that Toum should give him the breath from his <EM>right

tricity) that he might live in his <EM>second </EM>form. Both
the hieroglyph, and the text of chapter lxii. in the &quot;<EM>Book
of the Dead</EM>,&quot;<EM> </EM>show the identity of Toum with
Fohat. The former represents a man standing erect with the hieroglyph
<EM>of the breaths </EM>in his hands. The latter says: --
<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;I open to the chief of An (Heliopolis), I am Toum. I cross
the water spilt by Thot-Hapi, the lord of the horizon, and am
the <I>divider of the earth</I>&quot;<I> </I>(Fohat divides Space
and, with his <I>Sons</I>,<I> </I>the earth into seven zones)

the master of limitless eternity. I am the germ of eternity. I
am Toum, to whom eternity is accorded. . . . &quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
The very words used by Fohat in the <B>XI</B>th Book, and the
very titles given him. In the Egyptian Papyri the whole Cosmogony
of the Secret Doctrine is found scattered about in isolated sentences,
even in the &quot;Book of Dead.&quot; Number seven is quite as
much insisted upon and emphasized therein as in the <EM>Book of
Dzyan. </EM>&quot;The Great Water (the Deep or Chaos) is said
to be <EM>seven </EM>cubits deep&quot; -- &quot;cubits&quot; standing
here of course for divisions, zones, and principles. Therein,
&quot;in the great mother, all the Gods, and the <EM>seven great
ones </EM>are born.&quot; (See chapter cviii., 4, <EM>Book of
the Dead </EM>and<EM> Egyptian Pantheon</EM>)<EM>. </EM>Both Fohat
and Toum are addressed as the &quot;Great ones of the Seven Magic
Forces,&quot; who, &quot;conquer the Serpent <EM>Apap</EM>&quot;<EM>
</EM>or Matter.
<P>
No student of occultism, however, ought to be betrayed, by the
usual phraseology used in the translations of Hermetic Works,
into believing that the ancient Egyptians or Greeks spoke of,
and referred, monk-like, at every moment in conversation, to a
Supreme Being, God, the &quot;One Father and Creator of all,&quot;
etc., as found on every page of such translations. No such thing
indeed; and those texts <EM>are not the original Egyptian </EM>texts.
They are Greek compilations, the earliest of which does not go
beyond the early period of Neo-Platonism. No Hermetic

<P>
work written by Egyptians (<EM>vide</EM> &quot;Book of the Dead&quot;)
would speak of the one universal God of the Monotheistic systems
-- the one <EM>Absolute </EM>cause of all, was as unnameable and
unpronounceable in the mind of the ancient philosopher of Egypt,
as it is for ever <EM>Unknowable </EM>in the conception of Mr.
Herbert Spencer. As for the Egyptian in general, as M. Maspero
well remarks, whenever he &quot;arrived at the notion of divine
Unity, the God One was never 'God,' simply.&quot; And Lepage Renouf
very justly observed that the word <EM>Nouter</EM>,<EM> nouti</EM>,<EM>
</EM>&quot;god&quot; had never ceased <EM>being a generic name
</EM>with the Egyptians, nor has it ever become a personal pronoun.
Every God was the &quot;one living and unique God&quot; with them.
Their &quot;monotheism was purely geographical. If the Egyptian
of Memphis proclaimed the unity of Phtah to the exclusion of Ammon,
the Thebeian Egyptian proclaimed the unity of Ammon to the exclusion
of Phtah,&quot; as we now see done in India in the case of the
Saivas and the Vaishnavas. &quot;<EM>Ra</EM>, the 'One God' at
Heliopolis is not the same as Osiris, the 'One God' at Abydos,
and can be worshipped side by side with him, without being absorbed
by his neighbour. The one god is but the god of the <EM>nome </EM>or
the city,<EM> noutir</EM>,<EM> noutti</EM>,<EM> </EM>and does
not exclude the existence of the one god of that town or of the
neighbouring nome. In short, whenever speaking of Egyptian Monotheism,
one ought to speak of the Gods '<EM>One</EM>'<EM> </EM>of Egypt,
and not of the one god&quot; (Maspero, in the <EM>Guide au Musee
de Boulak.) </EM>It is by this feature, pre-eminently Egyptian,
that the authenticity of the various so-called <EM>Hermetic Books</EM>,<EM>
</EM>ought to be tested; and it is totally absent from the Greek
fragments known as such. This proves that a Greek Neo-Platonic,
or even a Christian hand, had no small share in the editing of
such works. Of course the fundamental philosophy is there, and
in many a place -- intact. But the style has been altered and
smoothed in a monotheistic direction, as much, if not more than
that of the Hebrew Genesis in its Greek and Latin translations.
They <EM>may </EM>be<EM> Hermetic </EM>works, but not works written
by either of the two Hermes -- or rather, by Thot (Hermes) the
directing intelligence of the Universe (<EM>See ch. xciv.</EM>,<EM>
Book of the Dead</EM>),<EM> </EM>or by Thot, his terrestrial incarnation
called Trismegistus, of the Rosetta stone.
<P>
But all is doubt, negation, iconoclasm and brutal indifference,
in our age of the hundred &quot;isms&quot; and no religion. Every
idol is broken save the Golden Calf.
<P>
Unfortunately, no nation or nations can escape their Karmic fate
any more than units and individuals do. History itself is dealt
with by the so-called historians as unscrupulously as legendary
lore. For this, Augustin Thierry has made the <EM>amende honorable</EM>,<EM>
</EM>if one may believe his biographers. He deplored the erroneous
principle that made them all (the <EM>would</EM>-<EM>be </EM>historiographers)
lose their way, and each presume to<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 676 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</H6>

<P>
correct tradition, &quot;that <EM>vox populi </EM>which nine times
out of ten is<EM> vox Dei</EM>;&quot;<EM> </EM>and he finally
admitted that <EM>in legend alone rests real history; </EM>for
&quot;legend,&quot; he adds, &quot;is <EM>living</EM> tradition,
and three times out of four it is truer than what we call History.&quot;*
<P>
While Materialists deny everything in the universe, save matter,
Archaeologists are trying to dwarf antiquity, and seek to destroy
every claim to ancient Wisdom by tampering with Chronology. Our
present-day Orientalists and Historical writers are to ancient
History that which the white ants are to the buildings in India.
More dangerous even than those Termites, the modern Archaeologists
-- the &quot;authorities&quot; of the future in the matter of
Universal History -- are preparing for the History of past nations
the fate of certain edifices in tropical countries: &quot;History
will tumble down and break into atoms in the lap of the twentieth
century, devoured to its foundations by her annalists,&quot; said
Michelet. Very soon, indeed, under their combined efforts, it
will share the fate of those ruined cities in both Americas, which
lie deeply buried under impassable virgin forests. Historical
facts will remain as concealed from view by the inextricable jungles
of modern hypotheses, denials and scepticism. But very happily
<EM>actual </EM>History repeats herself, for she proceeds, like
everything else, in cycles; and dead facts and events deliberately
drowned in the sea of modern scepticism will ascend once more
and reappear on the surface. . . .
<P>
In our Book II. the very fact that a work with pretensions to
philosophy, and which is an exposition of the most abstruse problems,
has to be commenced by tracing the evolution of mankind from what
<EM>are </EM>regarded as supernatural beings -- <EM>Spirits </EM>--<EM>
</EM>will arouse the most malevolent criticism. Believers in,
and the defenders of, the Secret Doctrine, however, will have
to bear the accusation of madness <EM>and worse</EM>,<EM> </EM>as<EM>
</EM>philosophically as for long years already the writer has
done. Whenever a Theosophist is taxed with insanity, he ought
to reply by quoting from Montesquieu's &quot;<EM>Lettres Persanes.</EM>&quot;<EM>
</EM>&quot;By opening so freely their lunatic asylums to their
supposed madmen, men only seek to assure each other that they
are not themselves mad.&quot; <HR>
