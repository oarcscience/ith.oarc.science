#### XII. ANCIENT THOUGHT IN MODERN DRESS.

**M**ODERN **S**CIENCE IS ANCIENT THOUGHT DISTORTED, and no more. We
have seen, however, WHAT INTUITIONAL SCIENTISTS THINK, and are busy
about; and now the reader may be given a few more proofs of the fact
that more than one F.R.S. is unconsciously approaching the derided
Secret Sciences.

With regard to cosmogony and primeval matter, modern speculations are
undeniably ancient thought, *improved* by contradictory theories of
recent origin. But the whole foundation belongs to Grecian and Indian
Archaic astronomy and physics, in those days always called philosophy.
In all the Aryan and Greek speculations, one meets with the conception
of an all-pervading, unorganized, and homogeneous matter, or *Chaos*,
re-named by modern scientists "Nebular condition of the world-stuff."
What Anaxagoras called "Chaos" in his *Homoiomeria* is now called
"primitive fluid" by Sir W. Thomson. The Hindu and Greek Atomists --
Kanada, Leucippus, Democritus, Epicurus, Lucretius, etc., etc., are now
reflected as in a clear mirror, in the supporters of the atomic theory
of our modern days, beginning with Leibnitz's *Monads*, and ending with
the "Vortical Atoms" of Sir W. Thomson.\* True, the corpuscular theory
of old is rejected, and the undulatory theory has taken its place. But
the question is, *whether the latter is so firmly established as not to
be liable to be dethroned as was its predecessor?* Light from its
metaphysical aspect was fully treated of in "*Isis Unveiled*": --

> "Light is the first begotten, and the first emanation of the Supreme,
> and Light is Life, says the Evangelist and the Kabalist. Both are
> electricity -- the life principle, the *anima mundi*, pervading the
> universe, the electric vivifier of all things. Light is the great
> Protean magician, and under the divine will of the architect,\*\* or
> rather the *architects*, the "Builders" (called *One* collectively),
> its multifarious, omnipotent waves gave birth to every form as well as
> to every living being. From its swelling electric bosom, spring
> *matter* and *spirit.* Within its beams lie the beginnings of all

> phenomena; it vitalizes and disorganizes; it gives life and produces

improved by their modern transformation.

\*\* I have been often taken to task for using expressions in *Isis*
denoting belief in a *personal* and anthropomorphic God. This is *not*
my idea. Kabalistically speaking, the "Architect" is the generic name
for the *Sephiroth*, the Builders of the Universe, as the "Universal
Mind" represents the collectivity of the Dhyan Chohanic Minds.

This is the *Ether*, as just explained in the views of Metcalfe,
repeated by Dr. Richardson, save the submission of the former to some
details of the modern undulatory theory. We do not say that we deny the
theory, but assert only that it needs completion and re-arrangement. But
the Occultists are by no means the only *heretics* in this respect; for
Mr. Robert Hunt, F.R.S., remarks, in his *Researches on Light in its
Chemical Relations*, that: --

> . . . . "the undulatory theory does not account for the results of his
> experiments. Sir David Brewster, in his *Treatise on Optics*, showing
> 'that the colours of vegetable life arise . . . . from a specific
> attraction which the particles of these bodies exercise over the
> differently-coloured rays of light,' and that 'it is by the light of
> the sun that the coloured juices of plants are elaborated, that the
> colours of bodies are changed, etc. . . . .' remarks that it is not
> easy to allow 'that such effects can be produced by the mere vibration
> of an ethereal medium.' And he is *forced*, he says, 'by this class of
> facts, to reason as if light was *material* (?).' Professor Josiah P.

> from the luminous body,' if correct, damages a good deal, if it does
> not kill the undulatory theory. That he is right, was proved
> repeatedly by experiments with photometers; and though it begins to be
> much doubted, the undulatory theory is still alive." ("*Isis
> Unveiled*.")

To this remark of Sir W. Brewster -- "forced to reason as if light was
material" -- there is a good deal to reply. Light, in one sense, is
certainly as material as electricity itself is. And if electricity is
*not* material, if it is only "a mode of motion," how is it that it can
be *stored up* in Faure's accumulators? Helmholtz says that electricity
must be as atomic as matter; and Mr. W. Crookes, F.R.S., supported the
view in his address to the Chemical Section of the British Association,
of which he was President (at Birmingham, 1886). This is what Helmholtz
says (*in his Faraday Lectures*, 1881): --

> "If we accept the hypothesis that the elementary substances are
> composed of atoms, we cannot avoid concluding that electricity also,
> positive as well as negative, is divided into definite elementary
> portions, which behave like atoms of electricity."

Here we have to repeat that which was already said in Section IX: there
is but one science that can henceforth direct modern research into the
one path which will lead to the discovery of the whole, hitherto

occult, truth, and it is the youngest of all -- *chemistry*, as it now
stands reformed. There is no other, not excluding astronomy, that can so
unerringly guide scientific intuition, as chemistry can. Two proofs of
it are to be found in the world of Science -- two great chemists, each
among the greatest in his own country, and these are Mr. Crookes and the
late Professor Butlerof: one, a thorough believer in abnormal phenomena;
the other, as fervid a Spiritualist as he was great in natural Sciences.
It becomes evident that while pondering over the ultimate divisibility
of matter, and in the hitherto *fruitless* chase after the element of
negative atomic weight, the scientifically trained mind of the chemist
must feel irresistibly drawn towards those ever-shrouded worlds, to the
mysterious beyond, whose measureless depths seem to close against the
approach of the too materialistic hand that would fain draw aside its
veil. "It is the unknown and the *ever unknowable*," warns the
Monist-Agnostic. Not so; answers the persevering chemist: -- "We are on
the track and are not daunted, and fain would we enter the mysterious
region which *ignorance tickets unknown.*"\*

A few lines at the very close of his lecture on the *Genesis of the
Elements* -- two or three sentences -- showed the eminent Scientist to
be on the royal road to the greatest discoveries. He has been
overshadowing for some time "the original *protyle*," and came to the
conclusion that "he who grasps the Key will be permitted to unlock some
of the deepest mysteries of creation." The *protyle*, as that great
chemist explains: --

> ". . . is a word analogous to protoplasm, to express the idea of the
> original primal matter existing before the evolution of the chemical
> elements. The word I have ventured to use for this purpose is
> compounded of \[\[*pro*\]\] (earlier than) and \[\[*hyle*\]\] (the
> stuff of which things are made). The word is scarcely a new coinage,
> for 600 years ago Roger Bacon wrote in his *Arte Chymiae*, "The
> elements are made out of \[\[*hyle*\]\] and every element is converted
> into the nature of another element."

The *Knowledge* of Roger Bacon did not come to this wonderful old
magician\*\* by inspiration, but because he studied ancient works on

###### \[\[Footnote(s)\]\] -------------------------------------------------

\* Mr. Crookes' "Presidential Address" at Birmingham. "There is but one
unknown -- *the ultimate substratum of Spirit* (Space). That which is
not the *Absolute* and the One is, in virtue of that very
differentiation, however far removed from the physical senses, always
accessible to the spiritual human mind, which is a coruscation of the
undifferentiable Integral." -- (*Practical Lessons on the Occult.*)

\*\* Thus, what the writer of the present work said ten years ago in
"*Isis Unveiled*" (*Vol. I.*) was prophetic, it seems. These are the
words: "Many of these mystics, by following what they were taught by
some treatises, secretly preserved from one generation to another,
*achieved discoveries which would* *not be despised even in our modern
days of exact sciences.* Roger Bacon, the friar, was laughed at as a
quack, and is now generally numbered among 'pretenders' to magic art;
but his discoveries were nevertheless accepted, and are now used by
those who ridicule him the most. Roger Bacon belonged by right, if not
by fact, to that Brotherhood which includes all those who \[\[Footnote

magic and alchemy, having a key to the real meaning of words. But see
what Mr. Crookes says of *protyle*, next neighbour to the unconscious
*Mulaprakriti* of the Occultists: --

> . . . . . "Let us start at the moment when the first element came into
> existence. Before this time, matter, as we know it, was not. It is
> equally impossible to conceive of matter without energy, as of energy
> without matter; from one point of view both are convertible terms.
> Before the birth of atoms, all those forms of energy, which become
> evident when matter acts upon matter, could not have existed\* -- they
> were locked up in the *protyle* as latent potentialities only.
> Coincident with the creation of atoms, all those attributes and
> properties, which form the means of discriminating one chemical
> element from another, start into existence fully endowed with energy."
> (*Presidential Address*, p. 16.)

With every respect due to the great knowledge of the lecturer, the
Occultist would put it otherwise. They would say that no atom is ever
"created," for the atoms are eternal within the bosom of the *One*
*Atom*, -- "the atom of atoms" -- viewed during Manvantara as the
*Jagad-Yoni* the *material* causative womb of the world. *Pradhana*
(unmodified matter), that which is the first form of *Prakriti*, or
material visible, as *well as invisible* nature, and *Purusha*, spirit,
are eternally one; and they are *Nirupadhi*, (without adventitious
qualities or attributes) only during *Pralaya*, and when *beyond* any of
the planes of consciousness of existence. The atom, as known to modern
science, is inseparable from *Purusha*, which is spirit, but is now
called "Energy" in Science. The *protyle* atom has not been comminuted
or subtilized: it has simply passed into that plane, which is no plane,
but the eternal state of everything beyond the planes of illusion. Both
*Purusha* and *Pradhana* are immutable and unconsumable, or *Aparinamin*
and *Avyaya*, in eternity; and both during the Mayavic periods may be
referred to as *Vyaya* and *Parinamin*, or that which can expand, pass
away and disappear, and is "modifiable." In this sense *Purusha*, must
of course, be held distinct in our conceptions from *Parabrahmam*.
Nevertheless that, which is called "energy" or "force" in Science and
has been explained as a *dual* Force by Metcalfe, is never, in fact, and
cannot be *energy* alone; for it is the substance of the world, its
soul, the *all*-*permeant* "Sarvaga," in conjunction with *Kala* "time."
The three are the trinity in one, during Manvantara, the all-potential
Unity, which acts on the plane of illusion (Maya) as three distinct
things. In Orphic

philosophy in Greece they were called *Phanes*, *Chaos*, and *Chronos*
-- the triad of the Occult philosophers of that period.

But see how closely Mr. Crookes brushes by the "Unknowable," and what
"potentialities" there are for the acceptance of Occult truths in his
discoveries. He continues, speaking of the evolution of atoms: --

> ". . . . Let us pause at the end of the first complete vibration and
> examine the result. We have already found the elements of water,
> ammonia, carbonic acid, the atmosphere, plant and animal life,
> phosphorus for the brain, salt for the seas, clay for the solid earth
> . . . phosphates and silicates sufficient for a world and inhabitants

> and follow it, may be referred with much probability to the particular
> way in which our Earth developed into a member of our solar system. If
> this be so, it may be that on our Earth only these blanks occur, and
> not generally throughout the universe."

This justifies several assertions in the Occult works.

*Firstly*, "that neither stars nor the sun can be said to be constituted
of those terrestrial elements with which the chemist is familiar, though
they are all present in the sun's outward robes -- and a host more of
elements so far unknown to science."

*Secondly*, that our globe has its own special laboratory on the
far-away outskirts of its atmosphere, crossing which, every atom and
molecule change and differentiate from their primordial nature.

And *Thirdly*, that though no element present on our earth could ever be
possibly found wanting in the sun, there are many others which have
either not reached, or not as yet been discovered on, our globe. "Some
may be missing in certain stars and heavenly bodies in the process of
formation; or, though present in them, these elements, on account of
their present state, may not respond as yet to the usual scientific
tests."\*\* Mr. Crookes speaks of an element of still lower atomic
weight than hydrogen, an *element purely hypothetical* as far as our
earth is concerned . . . though existing in abundance in the
chromosphere of the Sun -- the *helium.* Occult Science adds that not
one of the *elements* regarded by chemistry as such really deserves the
name.

Again we find Mr. Crookes speaking with approbation of "Dr. Carnelly's
weighty argument in favour of *the compound nature of the so-called
elements*, from their analogy to the compound radicles! " Hitherto,

\* Says Mr. Crookes in the same address: "The first riddle which we
encounter in chemistry is: 'What are the elements?' Of the attempts
hitherto made to define or explain an element, none satisfy the demands
of the human intellect. The text books tell us that an element is 'a
body which has not been decomposed ''that it is 'a something to which we
can add, but from which we can take nothing,' or 'a body which increases
in weight with every chemical change.' Such definitions are doubly
unsatisfactory: they are provisional, and may cease to-morrow to be
applicable in any given case. They take their stand, not on any
attribute of the things to be defined, but on the limitations of human
power: they are confessions of intellectual impotence."

\*\* And the lecturer quotes Sir George Airy, who says (*in Faraday*'*s
Life and Letters Vol. II.*, *p.* 354), "I can easily conceive that there
are plenty of bodies about us not subject to this intermutual action,
and *therefore not subject to the law of gravitation.*"

\*\*\* The Vedantic philosophy conceives of such; but then it is not
physics, but metaphysics, called by Mr. Tyndall "poetry" and "fiction."

This is, *in a strictly scientific*, but beautiful language, the
description of the evolution of the differentiated Universe in the
secret teachings. The learned gentleman closes his address in words,
every sentence of which is like a flash of light from beyond the dark
veil of materiality, hitherto thrown upon the exact sciences, and a step
forward towards the *Sanctum Sanctorum* of the Occult. (*Vide* § *XV.*,
"*Gods*, *Monads*, *and Atoms.*") Thus he says: --

\* In the form they are now, we conceive?

\*\* And to Kapila and Manu -- especially and originally.

\*\*\* Here is a scientific corroboration of the eternal law of
correspondences and analogy.

\*\*\*\* This method of illustrating the periodic law in the
classification of elements is, in the words of Mr. Crookes, proposed by
Professor Emerson Reynolds, of Dublin University, who . . . . "points
out that in each period, the general properties of the elements vary
from one to another, with approximate regularity until we reach the
*seventh member*, which is in more or less striking contrast with the
first element of the same period, as well as with the first of the next.
Thus chlorine, the seventh member of Mendeleef's third period, contrasts
sharply with both sodium, the first member of the same series, and with
potassium, the first member of the next series; whilst on the other
hand, sodium and potassium are closely analogous. The six elements,
whose atomic weights intervene between sodium and potassium, vary in
properties, step by step, until chlorine, the contrast to sodium, is
reached. But from chlorine to potassium, the analogue of sodium, there
is a change in properties *per saltum*. . . . . If we thus recognise a
contrast in properties -- more or less decided -- between the first and
the last members of each series, we can scarcely help admitting the
existence of a point of mean variation within each system. In general
the *fourth* element of each series possesses the property we might
expect a transition-element to exhibit. . . . . Thus for the purpose of
graphic translation, Professor Reynolds considers that the fourth member
of a period -- silicon, for example -- may be placed at the apex of a
symmetrical \[\[Footnote continued on next page\]\]

Thus inductive Science, in its Branches of Astronomy, Physics, and
Chemistry, while advancing timidly towards the conquest of Nature's
secrets in her final effects on our terrestrial plane, recedes to the
days of Anaxagoras and the Chaldees in its discoveries of (a) the origin
of our phenomenal world, and (b) the modes of formation of the bodies
that compose the universe. And having to turn back for their
cosmogonical hypotheses to the beliefs of the earliest philosophers, and
the systems of the latter -- systems that were all based on the
teachings of a universal secret doctrine with regard to the primeval
matter with its properties, functions, and laws, -- have we not the
right to hope that the day is not far off when Science will show a
better appreciation of the wisdom of the ancients than it has hitherto
done?

No doubt Occult philosophy could learn a good deal from exact modern
science; but the latter, on the other hand, might profit by ancient
learning in more than one way, and chiefly in Cosmogony. For

\[\[Footnote continued from previous page\]\] curve, which shall
represent for that particular period, the direction in which the
properties of the series of elements vary with rising atomic weights.

Now, the writer humbly confesses complete ignorance of modern chemistry
and its mysteries. But she is pretty well acquainted with the Occult
doctrine with regard to *correspondences of types and antitypes* in
nature, and perfect analogy as a fundamental law in Occultism. Hence she
ventures a remark which will strike every Occultist, however it may be
derided by orthodox Science. This method of illustrating the periodic
law in the behaviour of elements, whether or not still a hypothesis in
chemistry, *is a law* *in Occult Sciences.* Every well-read Occultist
knows that the *seventh* and *fourth* members -- whether in a septenary
chain of worlds, the septenary hierarchy of angels, or in the
constitution of man, animal, plant, or mineral atom -- that the
*seventh* and *fourth* members, we say, in the geometrically and
mathematically uniform workings of the immutable laws of Nature, always
play a distinct and specific part in the septenary system. From the
stars twinkling high in heaven, to the sparks flying asunder from the
rude fire built by the savage in his forest; from the hierarchies and
the essential constitution of the Dhyan Chohans -- organized for diviner
apprehensions and a loftier range of perception than the greatest
Western psychologist ever dreamed of, down to Nature's *classification*
of species among the humblest insects; finally from worlds to atoms,
everything in the universe, from great to small, proceeds in its
spiritual and physical evolution, cyclically and septennially, showing
its seventh and fourth number (the latter the turning point) behaving in
the same way as shown in that periodic law of atoms. Nature never
proceeds *per saltum.* Therefore, when Mr. Crookes remarks to this that
he does not "wish to infer that the gaps in Mendeleef's table, and in
this graphic representation of it (the diagram showing the evolution of
atoms) necessarily mean that there are elements actually existing to
fill up the gaps; these gaps may only mean that at the birth of the
elements there was an easy potentiality of the formation of an element
which would fit into the place" -- an Occultist would respectfully
remark to him that the latter hypothesis can only hold good, if the
septenary arrangement of atoms is not interfered with. This is *the one
law*, and an infallible method that must always lead to success, one who
follows it.

instance, the mystical signification, alchemical and transcendental, of
the many *imponderable* substances that fill interplanetary space, and
which, interpenetrating each, are the direct cause, at the lower end, of
the production of natural phenomena manifesting through *vibration*
(so-called). The knowledge of the *real* (not the hypothetical) nature
of Ether, or rather of the *Akasa*, and other mysteries, in short, can
alone lead to the knowledge of Forces. It is that substance against
which the materialistic school of the physicists rebels with such fury,
especially in France,\* and which exact Science has to advocate
notwithstanding. They cannot make away with it without incurring the
risk, like a modern Samson, of pulling down the pillars of the Temple of
Science, and getting buried under its roof.

The theories built upon the rejection of Force *outside* and independent
of *Matter pure and simple*, have been all shown fallacious. They do
not, and cannot, cover the ground, and many of the scientific data are
thus proved *unscientific.* "Ether produced Sound" is said in the
Puranas, and the statement is laughed at. It is the vibrations in *the
air*, we are corrected. And what is air? Could it exist if there were no
etheric medium in Space to buoy up its molecules? The case stands simply
thus. Materialism cannot admit the existence of anything *outside*
matter, because with the acceptance of an imponderable *Force* -- the
source and head of all the physical Forces -- other *intelligent* Forces
would have to be admitted virtually, and that would lead Science very
far. For it would have to accept as a sequel the presence in Man of a
still more spiritual power -- entirely independent, for once, of any
kind of matter physicists know anything about. Hence, apart from an
hypothetical ether of Space and gross physical bodies, the whole
Sidereal and unseen Space is, in the sight of the materialists, one
boundless *void* in nature -- blind, unintelligent, useless.

And now the next question is: What is that Cosmic Substance, and how far
can one go to suspect its nature or to wrench from it its secrets, and
thus feel justified in giving it a NAME? How far, especially, has modern
Science gone in the direction of those secrets, and what it is doing to
solve them. The latest hobby of Science, the "Nebular Theory," may
afford us some answer to this question. Let us then examine the
credentials of the **N**EBULAR **T**HEORY.
