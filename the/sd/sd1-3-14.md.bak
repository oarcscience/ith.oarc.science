#### XIV. FORCES -- MODES OF MOTION OR INTELLIGENCES?

**T**HIS is, then, the last word of physical science up to the present
year, 1888. Mechanical laws will never be able to prove the homogeneity
of primeval matter, except inferentially and as a desperate necessity,
when there will remain no other issue -- as in the case of Ether. Modern
Science is secure only in its own domain and region; within the physical
boundaries of our solar system, beyond which everything, every particle
of matter, is different from the matter it knows: which matter exists in
states of which Science can form no idea. *That* matter, which is truly
homogeneous, is beyond human perceptions, if perception is tied down
merely to the five senses. We feel its effects through those
INTELLIGENCES which are the results of its primeval differentiation,
whom we name Dhyan-Chohans; called in the Hermetic works the "Seven
Governors," those to whom Pymander, the "Thought Divine," refers as the
Building Powers, and whom Asklepios calls the "Supernal Gods." That
matter -- the real primordial substance, the noumenon of all the
"matter" we know of, -- even some of the astronomers have been led to
believe in, and to despair of the possibility of ever accounting for
rotation, gravitation, and the origin of any mechanical physical laws --
unless these *Intelligences* be admitted by Science. In the above-quoted
work upon astronomy, by Wolf,\* the author endorses fully the theory of
Kant, and the latter, if not in its general aspect, at any rate in some
of its features, reminds one strongly of certain esoteric teachings.
Here we have the world's system *reborn from its ashes*, through a
nebula; the emanation from the bodies, dead and dissolved in Space --
resultant of the *incandescence* of the solar centre reanimated by the
combustible matter of the planets. In this theory, generated and
developed in the brain of a young man hardly twenty-five years of age,
who had never left his native place, a small town of Northern Prussia
(Konigsberg) one can hardly fail to recognise either an inspiring
external power, or the *reincarnation* which the Occultists see in it.
It fills a gap which Newton, with all his genius, failed to bridge. And
surely it is our primeval matter, Akasa, that Kant had in view, when
proposing to solve Newton's difficulty and his failure to explain, by
the natural forces, the primitive impulse imparted to the planets, by
the postulation of a universally pervading primordial substance. For, as
he remarks in chapter viii., if it is once admitted that the perfect
harmony of the stars and planets and

Traduction de la Theorie du Ciel de Kant.*"

###### \[\[Vol. 1, Page\]\] 602 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.

the coincidence of their orbital planes prove the existence of a natural
cause, which would thus be the primal cause, "that cause *cannot really
be the matter which fills to*-*day the heavenly spaces.*" It must be
that which filled space -- was space -- originally, whose motion in
differentiated matter was the origin of the actual movements of the
sidereal bodies; and which, "*in condensing itself in those very
bodies*, thus abandoned the space that is found void to-day." In other
words, it is that same matter of which are now composed the planets,
comets, and the Sun himself, which, having in the origin formed itself
into those bodies, has preserved its inherent quality of motion; which
quality, now centred in their nuclei, directs all motion. A very slight
alteration of words is needed, and a few additions, to make of this our
Esoteric Doctrine.

The latter teaches that it is this original, primordial *prima materia*,
divine and intelligent, the direct emanation of the Universal Mind --
the *Daiviprakriti* (the divine light emanating from the *Logos*\*) --
which formed the nuclei of all the "self-moving" orbs in Kosmos. It is
the informing, ever-present moving-power and life-principle, the vital
soul of the suns, moons, planets, and even of our Earth. The former
latent: the last one active -- the invisible Ruler and guide of the
gross body attached to, and connected with, its Soul, which is the
spiritual emanation, after all, of these respective planetary Spirits.

Another quite occult doctrine is the theory of Kant, that the matter of
which the inhabitants and the animals of other planets are formed is of
*a lighter and more subtle nature and of a more perfect conformation in
proportion to their distance from the Sun.* The latter is too full of
Vital Electricity, of the physical, life-giving principle. Therefore,
the men on Mars are more ethereal than we are, while those of Venus are
more gross, though far more intelligent, if less spiritual.

The last doctrine is not quite ours -- yet those Kantian theories are as
metaphysical, and as transcendental as any occult doctrines; and more
than one man of Science would, if he but *dared* speak his mind, accept
them as Wolf does. From this Kantian mind and soul of the Suns and Stars
to the **M**AHAT (mind) and Prakriti of the Puranas, there is but a
step. After all, the admission of this by Science would be only the
admission of a natural cause, whether it would or would not stretch its
belief to such metaphysical heights. But then *Mahat*, the MIND, is a
"God," and physiology admits "mind" only as a temporary function of the
material brain, and no more.

The Satan of Materialism now laughs at all alike, and denies the visible
as well as the invisible. Seeing in light, heat, electricity, and even
in the *phenomenon of life*, only properties inherent in matter, it

\* Which "Light" we call *Fohat.*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

###### \[\[Vol. 1, Page\]\] 603 THE VITAL PRINCIPLE.

laughs whenever life is called **V**ITAL **P**RINCIPLE, and derides the
idea of its being independent of and distinct from the organism.

But here again scientific opinions differ as in everything else, and
there are several men of science who accept views very similar to ours.
Consider, for instance, what Dr. Richardson, **F.R.S**. (elsewhere
quoted at length) says of that "Vital principle," which he calls
"nervous ether" ("*Popular Science Review*," *Vol.* 10): --

> "I speak only of a veritable *material agent*, refined, it may be, to
> the world at large, but *actual and substantial*: an agent having
> quality of weight and of volume, an agent susceptible of chemical
> combination, and thereby of change of physical state and condition, an
> agent passive in its action, moved always, that is to say, by
> influences apart from itself,\* obeying other influences, an agent
> possessing no initiative power, no *vis or* *energia naturae*,\*\* but
> still playing a most important, if not a primary part in the
> production of the phenomena resulting from the action of the
> *energeia* upon visible matter" (*p.* 379).

As Biology and Physiology now deny, *in toto*, the existence of a "vital
principle," this extract, together with de Quatrefages' admission, is a
clear confirmation that there are men of science who take the same views
about "things occult" as theosophists and occultists do. These recognise
a distinct vital principle independent of the organism -- material, of
course, *as physical force cannot be divorced from matter*, but of a
substance existing in a state unknown to Science. *Life for them is
something more than the mere interaction of molecules and atoms.* There
is a vital principle without which no molecular combinations could ever
have resulted in a living organism, least of all in the so-called
"inorganic" matter of our plane of consciousness.

By "molecular combinations" is meant, of course, those of the matter of
our present illusive perceptions, which matter energises only on this,
our plane. And this is the chief point at issue.\*\*\*

###### \[\[Footnote(s)\]\] -------------------------------------------------

\* This is a mistake, which implies a material agent, distinct from the
influences which move it, *i.e.* blind matter and perhaps "God" again,
whereas this ONE Life is the very God and Gods "Itself."

\*\* The same error.

\*\*\* "Is the *Jiva* a myth, as science says, or is it not?" ask some
Theosophists, wavering between materialistic and idealistic Science. The
difficulty of really grasping esoteric problems concerning the "ultimate
state of matter" is again the old crux of the *objective* and the
*subjective.* What is matter? Is the matter of our present objective
consciousness anything but our SENSATIONS? True, the sensations we
receive come *from without*, but can we really (except in terms of
phenomena) speak of the "gross matter" of this plane as an entity apart
from and independent of us? To all such arguments Occultism answers:
True, in *reality* matter is not independent of, or existent outside,
our perceptions. Man is an *illusion*: granted. But the existence and
actuality of other, still more illusive, but not less *actual*, entities
than we are, is not a claim which is lessened, but rather strengthened
by this doctrine of Vedantic and even Kantian Idealism.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

###### \[\[Vol. 1, Page\]\] 604 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.

Thus the Occultists are not alone in their beliefs. Nor are they so
foolish, after all, in rejecting even the "gravity" of modern Science
along with other *physical* laws, and in accepting instead *attraction*
and *repulsion.* They see, moreover, in these two opposite Forces only
the two *aspects* of the universal unit, called "**M**ANIFESTING
**M**IND"; in which aspects, Occultism, through its great Seers,
perceives an innumerable Host of operative Beings: Cosmic Dhyan-Chohans,
Entities, whose essence, in its *dual* nature, is the Cause of all
terrestrial phenomena. For that essence is co-substantial with the
universal Electric Ocean, which is **L**IFE; and being dual, as said --
positive and negative -- it is the emanations of that duality that act
now on earth under the name of "modes of motion"; even *Force* having
now become objectionable as a word, for fear it should lead someone,
even in thought, to separate it from matter! It is, as Occultism says,
the dual *effects* of that dual essence, which have now been called
centripetal and centrifugal forces, negative and positive poles, or
polarity, heat and cold, light and darkness, etc., etc.

And it is maintained that even the Greek and Roman Catholic Christians,
are wiser in believing, as they do -- even if blindly connecting and
tracing them all to an anthropomorphic god -- in Angels, Archangels,
Archons, Seraphs, and Morning Stars: in all those theological *Deliciae
humani generis*, in short, that rule the cosmic elements, than Science
is, in disbelieving in them altogether, and advocating its mechanical
Forces. For these act very often with more than human intelligence and
pertinency. Nevertheless, that intelligence is denied and attributed to
blind chance. But, as De Maistre was right in calling the law of
gravitation merely a *word* which replaced "the thing unknown"
(*Soirees*), so are we right in applying the same remark to all the
other *Forces* of Science. And if it is objected that the Count was an
ardent Roman Catholic, then we may cite Le Couturier, as ardent a
materialist, who said the same thing, as also did Herschell and many
others. (*Vide Musee des Sciences*, *August*, 1856.)

From *Gods* to *men*, from Worlds to atoms, from a star to a rush-light,
from the Sun to the vital heat of the meanest organic being -- the world
of Form and Existence is an immense chain, whose links are all
connected. The law of Analogy is the first key to the world-problem, and
these links have to be studied co-ordinately in their occult relations
to each other.

When, therefore, the Secret Doctrine -- postulating that conditioned or
limited space (location) has no real being except in this world of
illusion, or, in other words, in our perceptive faculties -- teaches
that every one of the higher, as of the lower worlds, is interblended
with our own objective world; that millions of things and beings are, in
point of

------------------------------------------------------------------------

###### \[\[Vol. 1, Page\]\] 605 OCCULT AND PHYSICAL SCIENCES.

localization, around and *in* us, as we are around, with, and in them;
it is no metaphysical figure of speech, but a sober fact in Nature,
however incomprehensible to our senses.

But one has to understand the phraseology of Occultism before
criticising what it asserts. For example, the Doctrine refuses (as
Science does, in one sense) to use the words "above" and "below,"
"higher" and "lower," in reference to *invisible* spheres, as being
without meaning. Even the terms "East" and "West" are merely
conventional, necessary only to aid our human perceptions. For, though
the Earth has its two fixed points in the poles, North and South, yet
both East and West are variable relatively to our own position on the
Earth's surface, and in consequence of its rotation from West to East.
Hence, when "*other* worlds" are mentioned -- whether better or worse,
more spiritual or still more material, though both invisible -- the
Occultist does not locate *these spheres* either *outside* or *inside*
our Earth, as the theologians and the poets do; for their location is
nowhere in the space *known* to, and conceived by, the profane. They
are, as it were, blended with our world -- interpenetrating it and
interpenetrated by it. There are millions and millions of worlds and
firmaments visible to us; there still greater numbers beyond those
visible to the telescopes, and many of the latter kind do not belong to
our *objective* sphere of existence. Although as invisible as if they
were millions of miles beyond our solar system, they are yet with us,
near us, *within* our own world, as objective and material to their
respective inhabitants as ours is to us. But, again, the relation of
these worlds to ours is not that of a series of egg-shaped boxes
enclosed one within the other, like the toys called Chinese nests; each
is entirely under its own special laws and conditions, having no direct
relation to our sphere. The inhabitants of these, as already said, may
be, for all we know, or feel, passing *through* and *around* us as if
through empty space, their very habitations and countries being
interblended with ours, though not disturbing our vision, because we
have not yet the faculties necessary for discerning them. Yet by their
spiritual sight the Adepts, and even some seers and sensitives, are
always able to discern, whether in a greater or smaller degree, the
presence and close proximity to us of Beings pertaining to other spheres
of life. Those of the (spiritually) higher worlds, communicate only with
those terrestrial mortals who ascend to them, through individual
efforts, on to the higher plane they are occupying. . . .

of Commentary on the Book of DZYAN.*)

"Educated people," so-called, deride the idea of Sylphs, Salamanders,
Undines, and Gnomes; the men of science regard as an insult any mention
of such superstitions; and with a contempt of logic and common good
sense, that is often the prerogative of "accepted authority," they allow
those, whom it is their duty to instruct, to labour under the absurd
impression that in the whole Kosmos, or at any rate in our own
atmosphere, there are no other conscious, intelligent beings, save
ourselves.\* Any other humanity (composed of distinct *human* beings)
than a mankind with two legs, two arms, and a head with man's features
on it, would not be called human; though the etymology of the word would
seem to have little to do with the general appearance of a creature.
Thus, while Science sternly rejects even the possibility of there being
such (to us, generally) invisible creatures, Society, while believing in
it all *secretly*, is made to deride the idea openly. It hails with
mirth such works as the *Count de Gabalis*, and fails to understand that
*open satire is the securest mask.*

Nevertheless, such invisible worlds do exist. Inhabited as thickly as
our own is, they are scattered throughout apparent Space in immense
number; some far more material than our own world, others gradually
etherealizing until they become formless and are as "*Breaths.*" That
our physical eye does not see them, is no reason to disbelieve in them;
physicists can see neither their ether, atoms, nor "modes of motion," or
Forces. Yet they accept and teach them.

If we find, even in the natural world with which we are acquainted,
matter affording a partial analogy in the difficult conception of such
*invisible* worlds, there seems little difficulty in recognizing the
possibility of such a presence. The tail of a comet, which, though
attracting our attention by virtue of its luminosity, yet does not
disturb or impede our vision of objects, which we perceive through and
beyond it, affords the first stepping-stone toward a proof of the same.
The tail of a comet passes rapidly across our horizon, and we should
neither feel it, nor be cognizant of its passage, but for the brilliant
coruscation, often perceived only by a few interested in the phenomenon,
while everyone else remains ignorant of its presence and passage
*through*, or across, a portion of our globe. This tail may, or may not,
be an integral portion of the being of the comet, but its tenuity sub-

serves our purpose as an illustration. Indeed, it is no question of
superstition, but simply a result of transcendental science, and of
logic still more, to admit the existence of worlds formed of even far
more attenuated matter than the tail of a comet. By denying such a
possibility, Science has played for the last century into the hands of
neither philosophy nor true religion, but simply into those of theology.
To be able to dispute the better the plurality of even material worlds,
a belief thought by many churchmen incompatible with the teachings and
doctrines of the Bible,\* Maxwell had to calumniate the memory of
Newton, and try to convince his public that the principles contained in
the Newtonian philosophy are those "which lie at the foundation of all
atheistical systems." (*Vide* Vol. II., "*Plurality of Worlds.*")

"Dr. Whewell disputed the plurality of worlds by appeal to scientific
evidence," writes Professor Winchell.\*\* And if even the habitability
of physical worlds, of planets, and distant stars which shine in myriads
over our heads is so disputed, how little chance is there for the
acceptance of invisible worlds within the apparently transparent space
of our own!

But, if we can conceive of a world composed (for *our* senses) of matter
still more attenuated than the tail of a comet, hence of inhabitants in
it who are as ethereal, in proportion to *their* globe, as we are in
comparison with *our* rocky, hard-crusted earth, no wonder if we do not
perceive them, nor sense their presence or even existence. Only, in what
is the idea contrary to science? Cannot men and animals, plants and
rocks, be supposed to be endowed with quite a different set of senses
from those we possess? Cannot their organisms be born, developed, and
exist, under other laws of being than those that rule our little world?
Is it absolutely necessary that every corporeal being should be clothed
in "coats of skin" like those that Adam and Eve were provided with in
the legend of Genesis? Corporeality, we are told, however, by more than
one man of science, "may exist under very divergent conditions."\*\*\*
Do not we know through the

\* Nevertheless, it will be shown on the testimony of the Bible itself,
and of such good Christian theologians as Cardinal Wiseman, that this
plurality is taught in both the *Old* and the *New* Testaments.

\*\* See "The Plurality of the Worlds," wherein the list of many men of
Science, who wrote to prove the theory, is given.

\*\*\* Professor A. Winchell -- arguing upon the plurality of the worlds
-- makes the following remarks: "It is not at all improbable that
substances of a refractory nature might be so mixed with other
substances, known or unknown to us, as to be capable of enduring vastly
greater vicissitudes of heat and cold than is possible with terrestrial
organisms. The tissues of terrestrial animals are simply suited to
terrestrial conditions. Yet even here we find different types and
species of animals adapted to the trials of extremely dissimilar
situations. . . . . . That an animal should be a quadruped or a

discoveries of that very all-denying science that we are surrounded by
myriads of invisible lives? If these microbes, bacteria and the *tutti
quanti* of the infinitesimally small, are invisible to us by virtue of
their minuteness, cannot there be, at the other pole of it, beings as
invisible owing to the quality of their texture or matter -- to its
tenuity, in fact? Conversely, as to the effects of cometary matter, have
we not another example of a half visible form of life and matter? The
ray of sunlight entering our apartment, reveals in its passage myriads
of tiny beings living their little life and ceasing to be, independent
and heedless of whether they are perceived or not by our grosser
materiality. And so again, of the microbes and bacteria and such-like
unseen beings in other elements. We passed them by, during those long
centuries of dreary ignorance, after the lamp of knowledge in the
heathen and highly philosophical systems had ceased to throw its bright
light on the ages of intolerance and bigotry during early Christianity;
and we would fain pass them by again now.

And yet these *lives* surrounded us *then* as they do now. They have
worked on, obedient to their own laws, and it is only as they were
gradually revealed by Science that we have begun to take cognisance of
them, as of the effects produced by them.

###### \[\[Footnote(s)\]\] -------------------------------------------------

\[\[Footnote continued from previous page\]\] biped is something not
depending on the necessities of organization, or instinct, or
intelligence. That an animal should possess just five senses is not a
necessity of percipient existence. There may be animals on the earth
with neither smell nor taste. There may be beings on other worlds, and
*even on this*, who possess more numerous senses than we. The
possibility of this is apparent when we consider the high probability
that other properties and other modes of existence lie among the
resources of the Kosmos, and even of terrestrial matter. There are
animals which subsist where rational man would perish -- in the soil, in
the river, and the sea" . . . (and why not *human* beings of different
organizations, in such case?) . . . "Nor is incorporated rational
existence conditioned on warm blood, nor on any temperature which does
not change the forms of matter of which the organism may be composed.
*There may be intelligences corporealized* after some concept not
involving the processes of injection, assimilation, and reproduction.
Such bodies would not require daily food and warmth. They might be lost
in the abysses of the ocean, or laid up on a stormy cliff through the
tempests of an Arctic winter, or plunged in a volcano for a hundred
years, and yet retain consciousness and thought. It is conceivable. Why
might not psychic natures be enshrined in indestructible flint and
platinum? These substances are no further from the nature of
intelligence than carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and lime. But, not to carry
the thought to such an extreme (?), might not high intelligences be
embodied in frames as indifferent to external conditions as the sage of
the western plains, or the lichens of Labrador, the rotifers that remain
dried for years, or the spores of bacteria which pass living through
boiling water. . . . These suggestions are made simply to remind the
reader how little can be argued respecting the necessary conditions of
intelligent, organized existence, from the standard of corporeal
existence found upon the earth. Intelligence is, from its nature, as
universal and as uniform as the laws of the Universe. Bodies are merely
the local fitting of intelligence to particular modifications of
universal matter or Force." (*World*-*Life*, *or Comparative Geology*,
pp. 496-498 *et seq.*)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

###### \[\[Vol. 1, Page\]\] 609 THE GEOLOGY OF ENOCH.

How long has it taken the world, as it is now, to become what it is? If
it can be said of cosmic dust that some of it comes to the present day
"*which had never belonged to the earth before*" ("*World*-*Life*"), how
much more logical to believe -- as the Occultists do -- that through the
countless ages and millions of years that have rolled away, since that
dust aggregated and formed the globe we live in around its *nucleus* of
*intelligent* primeval substance -- many humanities, differing from our
present mankind, as greatly as the one which will evolve millions of
years hence will differ from our races, appeared but to disappear from
the face of the earth, as our own will. Those primitive and far-distant
humanities, having, as geologists think, left no tangible relics of
themselves, are denied. All trace of them is swept away, and therefore
they have never existed. Yet their relics -- a very few of them, truly
-- are to be found, and they have to be discovered by geological
research. Though, even if they were never to be met with, there is no
reason to say that no men could have ever lived in those geological
times, to which the period of their presence on earth is assigned. For
their organisms needed no warm blood, no atmosphere, no feeding; the
author of "World-Life" is right, and it is no such *great extreme* to
believe even as we do, that as there may be, on scientific hypotheses,
"psychic natures enshrined in indestructible flint and platinum" to this
day, so there were psychic natures enshrined in forms of equal
*indestructible* primeval matter -- the real forefathers of our fifth
race.

When we speak, therefore, as in Book II., of men who inhabited this
globe 18,000,000 years back, we have in the mind neither the men of our
present races, nor the present atmospheric laws, thermal conditions,
etc. The Earth and mankind, like the Sun, Moon, and planets, have all
their growth, changes, developments, and gradual evolution in their
life-periods; they are born, become infants, then children, adolescents,
grown-up bodies, grow old, and finally die. Why should not *Mankind* be
also under this universal law? Says Uriel to Enoch: "Behold, I have
showed thee all things. Thou seest the Sun, Moon, and those which
conduct the stars of heaven, *which cause all their operations*,
seasons, and arrivals to return. . . . *In the days of sinners* the
years shall be shortened . . . everything done on Earth shall be
subverted . . . the moon shall change its laws" . . . etc. (Ch.
*lxxix.*)

The "days of Sinners" meant the days when matter would be in its full
sway on Earth, and man would have reached the apex of physical
development in stature and animality. That came to pass during the
period of the Atlanteans, about the middle point of their Race (the
4th), which was drowned as prophesied by Uriel. Since then man began
decreasing in physical stature, strength, and years, as will be shown in
