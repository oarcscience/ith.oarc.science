#### <span id="preface">PREFACE.</span>

**T**HE Author -- the writer, rather -- feels it necessary to apologise
for the long delay which has occurred in the appearance of this work. It
has been occasioned by ill-health and the magnitude of the undertaking.
Even the two volumes now issued do not complete the scheme, and these do
not treat exhaustively of the subjects dealt with in them. A large
quantity of material has already been prepared, dealing with the history
of occultism as contained in the lives of the great Adepts of the Aryan
Race, and showing the bearing of occult philosophy upon the conduct of
life, as it is and as it ought to be. Should the present volumes meet
with a favourable reception, no effort will be spared to carry out the
scheme of the work in its entirety. The third volume is entirely ready;
the fourth almost so.

This scheme, it must be added, was not in contemplation when the
preparation of the work was first announced. As originally announced, it
was intended that the "Secret Doctrine" should be an amended and
enlarged version of "Isis Unveiled." It was, however, soon found that
the explanations which could be added to those already put before the
world in the last-named and other works dealing with esoteric science,
were such as to require a different method of treatment: and
consequently the present volumes do not contain, in all, twenty pages
extracted from "Isis Unveiled."

The author does not feel it necessary to ask the indulgence of her
readers and critics for the many defects of literary style, and the
imperfect English which may be found in these pages. She is a foreigner,
and her knowledge of the language was acquired late in life. The English
tongue is employed because it offers the most widely-diffused medium for
conveying the truths which it had become her duty to place before the
world.

These truths are in no sense put forward as a *revelation*; nor does the
author claim the position of a revealer of mystic lore, now made public
for the first time in the world's history. For what is contained in this
work is to be found scattered throughout thousands of volumes embodying
the scriptures of the great Asiatic and early European religions, hidden
under glyph and symbol, and hitherto left unnoticed because of this
veil. What is now attempted is to gather the oldest tenets together and
to make of them one harmonious and unbroken whole. The sole advantage
which the writer has over her predecessors, is that she need not resort
to personal speculations and theories. For this work is a partial
statement of what she herself has been taught by more advanced students,
supplemented, in a few details only, by the results of her

------------------------------------------------------------------------

own study and observation. The publication of many of the facts herein
stated has been rendered necessary by the wild and fanciful speculations
in which many Theosophists and students of mysticism have indulged,
during the last few years, in their endeavour to, as they imagined, work
out a complete system of thought from the few facts previously
communicated to them.

It is needless to explain that this book is not the Secret Doctrine in
its entirety, but a select number of fragments of its fundamental
tenets, special attention being paid to some facts which have been
seized upon by various writers, and distorted out of all resemblance to
the truth.

But it is perhaps desirable to state unequivocally that the teachings,
however fragmentary and incomplete, contained in these volumes, belong
neither to the Hindu, the Zoroastrian, the Chaldean, nor the Egyptian
religion,.neither to Buddhism, Islam, Judaism nor Christianity
exclusively. The Secret Doctrine is the essence of all these. Sprung
from it in their origins, the various religious schemes are now made to
merge back into their original element, out of which every mystery and
dogma has grown, developed, and become materialised.

It is more than probable that the book will be regarded by a large
section of the public as a romance of the wildest kind; for who has ever
even heard of the book of Dzyan?

The writer, therefore, is fully prepared to take all the responsibility
for what is contained in this work, and even to face the charge of
having invented the whole of it. That it has many shortcomings she is
fully aware; all that she claims for it is that, romantic as it may seem
to many, its logical coherence and consistency entitle this new Genesis
to rank, at any rate, on a level with the "working hypotheses" so freely
accepted by modern science. Further, it claims consideration, not by
reason of any appeal to dogmatic authority, but because it closely
adheres to Nature, and follows the laws of uniformity and analogy.

The aim of this work may be thus stated: to show that Nature is not "a
fortuitous concurrence of atoms," and to assign to man his rightful
place in the scheme of the Universe; to rescue from degradation the
archaic truths which are the basis of all religions; and to uncover, to
some extent, the fundamental unity from which they all spring; finally,
to show that the occult side of Nature has never been approached by the
Science of modern civilization.

If this is in any degree accomplished, the writer is content. It is
written in the service of humanity, and by humanity and the future
generations it must be judged. Its author recognises no inferior court
of appeal. Abuse she is accustomed to; calumny she is daily acquainted
with; at slander she smiles in silent contempt.

*De minimis non curat lex.*
