#### ยง VI. THE MUNDANE EGG.

**W**HENCE this universal symbol? The Egg was incorporated as a sacred
sign in the cosmogony of every people on the Earth, and was revered both
on account of its form and its inner mystery. From the earliest mental
conceptions of man, it was known as that which represented most
successfully the origin and secret of being. The gradual development of
the imperceptible germ within the closed shell; the inward working,
without any apparent outward interference of force, which from a latent
*nothing* produced an active *something*, needing nought save heat; and
which, having gradually evolved into a concrete, living creature, broke
its shell, appearing to the outward senses of all a self-generated, and
self-created being -- must have been a standing miracle from the
beginning.

The secret teaching explains the reason for this reverence by the
Symbolism of the prehistoric races. The "First Cause" had no name in the
beginnings. Later it was pictured in the fancy of the thinkers as an
ever invisible, mysterious Bird that dropped an Egg into Chaos, which
Egg becomes the Universe. Hence Brahm was called Kalahansa, "the swan in
(Space and) Time." He became the "Swan of Eternity," who lays at the
beginning of each Mahamanvantara a "Golden Egg." It typifies the great
Circle, or O, itself a symbol for the universe and its spherical bodies.

The second reason for its having been chosen as the symbolical
representation of the Universe, and of our earth, was its form. It was a
Circle and a Sphere; and the ovi-form shape of our globe must have been
known from the beginning of symbology, since it was so universally
adopted. The first manifestation of the Kosmos in the form of an egg was
the most widely diffused belief of antiquity. As Bryant shows (iii.,
165), it was a symbol adopted among the Greeks, the Syrians, Persians,
and Egyptians. In chap. liv. of the Egyptian Ritual, Seb, the god of
Time and of the Earth, is spoken of as having laid an egg, or the
Universe, "an egg conceived at the hour of the great one of the Dual
Force" (Sec. V., 2, 3, etc.).

Ra is shown like Brahma gestating in the Egg of the Universe. The
deceased is "resplendent in the Egg of the land of mysteries" (xxii.,
1). For, this is "the Egg to which is given life among the gods" (xlii.,
11). "It is the Egg of the great clucking Hen, the Egg of Seb, who
issues from it like a hawk" (lxiv., 1, 2, 3; lxxvii., 1).

With the Greeks the Orphic Egg is described by Aristophanes, and was
part of the Dionysiac and other mysteries, during which

------------------------------------------------------------------------

the Mundane Egg was consecrated and its significance explained; Porphyry
showing it a representation of the world, \[\[*Ermenenei de to oon
kosmon*\]\]. Faber and Bryant have tried to show that the egg typified
the ark of Noah, which, unless the latter is accepted as purely
allegorical and symbolical, is a wild belief. It can have typified the
ark only as a synonym of the moon, the *argha* which carries the
universal seed of life; but had surely nothing to do with the ark of the
Bible. Anyhow, the belief that the universe existed in the beginning in
the shape of an egg was general. And as Wilson has it: "A similar
account of the first aggregation of the elements in the form of an egg
is given in all the (Indian) Puranas, with the usual epithet Haima or
Hiranya, 'golden' as it occurs in Manu." Hiranya, however, means
"resplendent," "shining," rather than "golden," as proven by the great
Indian scholar, the late Swami Dayanand Sarasvati, in his unpublished
polemics with Professor Max Muller. As said in the Vishnu Purana:
"Intellect (Mahat) . . . the (unmanifested) gross elements inclusive,
formed an egg . . . and the lord of the Universe himself abided in it,
in the character of Brahma. In that egg, O Brahman, were the continents,
and seas and mountains, the planets and divisions of the universe, the
gods, the demons and mankind." (*Book* i., *ch.* 2.) Both in Greece and
in India the first visible male being, who united in himself the nature
of either sex, abode in the egg and issued from it. This "first born of
the world" was Dionysius, with some Greeks; the god who sprang from the
mundane egg, and from whom the mortals and immortals were derived. The
god Ra is shown in the *Ritual* (Book of the Dead, xvii., 50) beaming in
his egg (the Sun), and he starts off as soon as the god *Shoo* (the
Solar energy) awakens and gives him the impulse. "He is in the Solar
egg, the egg to which is given life among the gods" (*Ibid.*, xlii.,
13). The Solar god exclaims: "I am the creative soul of the celestial
abyss. None sees my nest, none can break my egg, I am the Lord!"
(*Ibid.*, LXXXV.).

In view of this circular form, the "\|" issuing from the
"![](sd1-4a.jpg)," or the egg, or the male from the female in the
androgyne, it is strange to find a scholar saying -- on the ground that
the most ancient Indian **MSS**. show no trace of it -- that the ancient
Aryans were ignorant of the decimal notation. The 10, being the sacred
number of the universe, was secret and esoteric, both as the unit and
cipher, or *zero*, the circle. Moreover, Professor Max Muller says that
"the two words *cipher* and *zero*, which are but one, are sufficient to
prove that our figures are borrowed from the Arabs.\* Cipher is the
Arabic "cifron," and means

###### \[\[Footnote(s)\]\] -------------------------------------------------

\* See Max Muller's "Our Figures."

###### \[\[Vol. 1, Page\]\] 361 WHENCE OUR FIGURES?

*empty*, a translation of the Sanscrit name of nought "sunya," he
says.\* The Arabs had their figures from Hindustan, and never claimed
the discovery for themselves.\*\* As to the Pythagoreans, we need but
turn to the ancient manuscripts of Boethius's *Geometry*, composed in
the sixth century, to find among the Pythagorean numerals\*\*\* the 1
and the *nought*, as the first and final ciphers. And Porphyry, who
quotes from the Pythagorean *Moderatus*,*\*\*\*\** says that the
numerals of Pythagoras were "hieroglyphical symbols, by means whereof he
explained ideas concerning the nature of things," or the origin of the
universe.

Now, if, on the other hand, the most ancient Indian manuscripts show as
yet no trace of decimal notation in them, and Max Muller states very
clearly that until now he has found but nine letters (the initials of
the Sanscrit numerals) in them; on the other hand, we have records as
ancient to supply the wanted proof. We speak of the sculptures and the
sacred imagery in the most ancient temples of the far East. Pythagoras
derived his knowledge from India; and we find Professor Max Muller
corroborating this statement, at least so far as to allow the
*Neo*-Pythagoreans to have been the first teachers of "ciphering," among
the Greeks and Romans; that "they at Alexandria, or in Syria, became
acquainted with the Indian figures, and adapted them to the Pythagorean
abacus" (our figures). This cautious admission implies that Pythagoras
himself was acquainted with but *nine* figures. Thus we might reasonably
answer that, although we possess no certain proof (*exoterically*) that
the decimal notation was known by Pythagoras, who lived on the very
close of the archaic ages,\*\*\*\*\* we have yet sufficient evidence to
show that the full numbers, as given by Boethius, were known to the
Pythagoreans, even before Alexandria was built.\*\*\*\*\*\* This
evidence we find in Aristotle, who says that "some philosophers hold
that ideas and numbers are of the same nature, and amount to TEN in
all."\*\*\*\*\*\*\* This, we believe, will be sufficient to show that
the decimal notation was known among them at least as early as four
centuries B.C., for Aristotle does not seem to treat the question as an
innovation of the "Neo-Pythagoreans."

\* A Kabalist would be rather inclined to believe that as the Arabic
*cifron* was taken from the Indian *Synya*, nought, so the Jewish
Kabalistic Sephiroth (*Sephrim*) were taken from the word cipher, not in
the sense of emptiness but the reverse -- that of creation by number and
degrees in their evolution. And the Sephiroth are 10 or

###### \[\[Vol. 1, Page\]\] 362 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.

But we know more than that: *we* *know* that the decimal system must
have been known to the mankind of the earliest archaic ages, since the
whole astronomical and geometrical portion of the secret sacerdotal
language was built upon the number 10, or the combination of the male
and female principles, and since the Pyramid of "Cheops" is built upon
the measures of this decimal notation, or rather upon the digits and
their combinations with the *nought.* Of this, however, sufficient was
said in *Isis Unveiled*, and it is useless to repeat and return to the
same subject.

The symbolism of the Lunar and Solar Deities is so inextricably mixed
up, that it is next to impossible to separate such glyphs as the egg,
the lotus, and the "sacred" animals from each other. The *ibis*, for
instance, sacred to Isis, who is often represented with the head of that
bird, sacred also to Mercury or Thoth, because that god assumed its form
while escaping from Typhon, -- the *ibis* was held in the greatest
veneration in Egypt. There were two kinds of ibises, Herodotus tells us
(Lib. II. c. 75 *et seq.*) in that country: one *quite black*, the other
black and white. The former is credited with fighting and exterminating
the winged serpents which came every spring from Arabia and infested the
country. The other was sacred to the moon, because the latter planet is
white and brilliant on her external side, dark and black on that side
which she never turns to the earth. Moreover, the *ibis* kills land
serpents, and makes the most terrible havoc amongst the eggs of the
crocodile, and thus saves Egypt from having the Nile infested by those
horrible Saurians. The bird is credited with doing so in the moonlight,
and thus being helped by *Isis*, as the moon, her sidereal symbol. But
the nearer esoteric truth underlying these popular myths is, that
Hermes, as shown by Abenephius (*De cultu Egypt.*), watched under the
form of that bird over the Egyptians, and taught them the occult arts
and sciences. This means simply that the *ibis religiosa* had and has
"magical" properties in common with many other birds, the albatross
pre-eminently, and the mythical white swan, the swan of Eternity or
Time, the **K**ALAHANSA.

Were it otherwise, indeed, why should all the ancient peoples, who were
no more fools than we are, have had such a superstitious dread of
killing certain birds? In Egypt, he who killed an *ibis*, or the golden
hawk -- the symbol of the Sun and Osiris -- risked and could hardly
escape death. The veneration of some nations for birds was such that
Zoroaster, in his precepts, forbids their slaughter as a heinous crime.
We laugh in our age at every kind of divination. Yet why should so many
generations have believed in divination by birds, and even in zoomancy,
said by Suidas to have been imparted by Orpheus, who taught how to
perceive in the yoke and white of

------------------------------------------------------------------------

###### \[\[Vol. 1, Page\]\] 363 EGG-BORN LOGOI.

the egg, under certain conditions, that which the bird born from it
would have seen around it during its short life. This occult art, which
demanded 3,000 years ago the greatest learning and the most abstruse
mathematical calculations, has now fallen into the depths of
degradation: it is old cooks and fortune-tellers who read their future
to servant-girls in search of husbands, by means of the white of an egg
in a glass.

Nevertheless, even Christians have to this day their sacred birds; for
instance, the dove, the symbol of the Holy Ghost. Nor have they
neglected the sacred animals. The *Evangelical* zoolatry -- the Bull,
the Eagle, the Lion, and the Angel (in reality the Cherub, or Seraph,
the fiery-winged Serpent), is as much pagan as that of the Egyptians or
the Chaldeans. These four animals are, in reality, the symbols of the
four elements, and of the four *lower* principles in man. Nevertheless,
they correspond physically and materially to the four constellations
that form, so to speak, the *suite* or *cortege* of the Solar God, and
occupy during the winter solstice the four cardinal points of the
zodiacal circle. These four "animals" may be seen in many of the Roman
Catholic New Testaments where the *portraits* of the evangelists are
given. They are the animals of Ezekiel's Mercabah.

As truly stated by Ragon, "the ancient Hierophants have combined so
cleverly the dogmas and symbols of their religious philosophies, that
these symbols can be fully explained only by the combination and
knowledge of *all* the keys." They can be only *approximately*
interpreted, even if one finds out three out of these seven systems: the
*anthropological*, the *psychic*, and the *astronomical.* The two chief
interpretations, the highest and the lowest, the spiritual and the
physiological, they preserved in the greatest secrecy until the latter
fell into the dominion of the profane. Thus far, with regard only to the
*pre-historic* Hierophants, with whom that which has now become purely
(or impurely) phallic, was a science as profound and as mysterious as
biology and physiology are now. This was their exclusive property, the
fruit of their studies and discoveries. The other two were those which
dealt with the creative gods (theogony), and with creative man, *i.e.*,
the ideal and the practical mysteries. These interpretations were so
cleverly veiled and combined, that many were those who, while arriving
at the discovery of one meaning, were baffled in understanding the
significance of the others, and could never unriddle them sufficiently
to commit dangerous indiscretions. The highest, the first and the fourth
-- theogony in relation to anthropogony -- were almost impossible to
fathom. We find the proofs of this in the Jewish "Holy Writ."

It is owing to the serpent being oviparous, that it became a symbol of
wisdom and an emblem of the Logoi, or the *self-born.* In the temple of
Philoe in Upper Egypt, an egg was artificially prepared of clay made of

------------------------------------------------------------------------

###### \[\[Vol. 1, Page\]\] 364 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.

various incenses, and it was made to hatch by a peculiar process, when a
*cerastes* (the horned viper) was born. The same was done in antiquity
for the cobra in the Indian temples. The *creative* God emerges from the
egg that issues from the mouth of Kneph -- as a winged serpent --
because the Serpent is the symbol of the All-wisdom. With the Hebrews he
is glyphed by the "flying or fiery serpents" of the Wilderness and
Moses, and with the Alexandrian mystics he becomes the Ophio-Christos,
the Logos of the Gnostics. The Protestants try to show that the allegory
of the Brazen Serpent and of the "fiery serpents" has a direct reference
to the mystery of Christ and Crucifixion\*; but it has a far nearer
relation, in truth, *to the mystery of generation*, when dissociated
from the egg with the central germ, or the *circle with its central
point.* The *brazen Serpent* had no such holy meaning as that; nor was
it, in fact, glorified above the "*fiery serpents*" *for the bite of
which it was only a natural remedy.* The symbological meaning of the
word "brazen" being the feminine principle, and that of fiery, or
"gold," the male one.\*\*

In the *Book of the Dead*, as just shown, reference is often made to the
Egg. Ra, the mighty one, remains in his Egg, during the struggle between
the "children of the rebellion" and *Shoo* (the Solar Energy and the
Dragon of Darkness) (ch. xvii.). The deceased is resplendent in his

###### \[\[Footnote(s)\]\] -------------------------------------------------

\* And this *only* because the brazen serpent was lifted on a pole! It
had rather a reference to Mico the Egyptian egg standing upright
supported by the sacred Tau; since the Egg and the Serpent are
inseparable in the old worship and symbology of Egypt, and since both
the Brazen and "fiery" serpents were *Saraphs*, the "burning fiery"
messengers, or the serpent Gods, the *nagas* of India. It was a purely
phallic symbol without the egg, while when associated with it -- it
related to cosmic creation.

\*\* "Brass was a metal symbolizing the *nether world* . . . . that of
the womb where life should be given . . . The word for serpent was in
Hebrew *Nakash*, but this is the same term for *brass.*" It is said in
Numbers (xxi.) that the Jews complained of the Wilderness *where there
was no water* (*v*. 5); after which "the Lord sent fiery serpents" to
bite them, when, to oblige Moses, he gives him as a remedy the *brazen
serpent* on a pole to look at; after which "any man when he beheld the
serpent of brass . . . . *lived*" (?). After that the "Lord," gathering
the people together at the well of Beer, gives them water, (14-16), and
grateful Israel sang this song, "Spring up, O Well," (*v*. 17). When,
after studying symbology, the Christian reader comes to understand the
innermost meaning of these three symbols -- *water*, *brazen*, *the
serpent*, and a few more -- *in the sense given to them in the Holy
Bible*, he will hardly like to connect the sacred name of his Saviour
with the "Brazen Serpent" incident. The Seraphim ![](sd1-364a.gif)
(fiery winged serpents) are no doubt connected with, and inseparable
from, the idea "of the serpent of eternity -- God," as explained in
Kenealy's Apocalypse. But the word cherub also meant serpent, in one
sense, though its direct meaning is different; because the *Cherubim*
and the Persian winged \[\[*gruphes*\]\] "griffins" -- the guardians of
the golden mountain -- are the same, and their compound name shows their
character, as it is formed of ![](sd1-364b.gif) (kr) *circle*, and
![](sd1-364c.gif) "aub," or ob -- serpent -- therefore, a "serpent in a
circle." And this settles the phallic character of the Brazen Serpent,
and justifies Hezekiah for breaking it. (*See II. Kings*, 18, 4).

Egg when he crosses to the land of mystery (xxii. i.). He is the Egg of
Seb (liv. 1-3). . . . The Egg was the symbol of life in *immortality*
and eternity; as also the glyph of the generative matrix; and the *tau*,
associated with it, only of life and birth in *generation.* The Mundane
Egg was placed in *Khnoom*, the "Water of Space," or the feminine
*abstract* principle (Khnoom becoming, with the *fall* of mankind into
generation and phallicism, Ammon, the *creative* God); and when *Phtah*,
the "fiery god," carries the Mundane egg in his hand, then the symbolism
becomes quite terrestrial and concrete in its significance. In
conjunction with the hawk, the symbol of Osiris-Sun, the symbol is dual:
it relates to both lives -- the mortal and the immortal. In Kircher's
*OEdipus Egyptiacus* (vol. iii., p. 124) one can see, on the papyrus
engraved in it, an egg floating above the mummy. This is the symbol of
hope and the promise of a *second birth* for the *Osirified* dead; his
Soul, after due purification in the Amenti, will gestate in this egg of
immortality, to be reborn from it into a new life on earth. For this
Egg, in the esoteric Doctrine, is the *Devachan*, the abode of Bliss;
the winged scarabeus being alike a symbol of it. The "winged globe" is
but another form of the egg, and has the same significance as the
scarabeus, the *Khopiroo* (from the root *Khoproo* "to become," "to be
reborn,") which relates to the rebirth of man, as well as to his
spiritual regeneration.

In the Theogony of Mochus, we find AEther first, and then the air, from
which Ulom, the *intelligible* (\[\[*noetos*\]\]) deity (the visible
Universe of Matter) is born out of the Mundane Egg. (Mover's
*Phoinizer*, p. 282.)

In the *Orphic* Hymns, the Eros-Phanes evolves from the divine Egg,
which the *AEthereal Winds* impregnate, wind being "the Spirit of the
unknown Darkness" -- "the spirit of God" (as explains K. O. Muller,
236); the divine "Idea," says Plato, "who is said to move AEther."

In the Hindu *Katakopanishad*, Purusha, the divine spirit, already
stands before the original matter, "from whose union springs the great
soul of the world," Maha-Atma, Brahma, the Spirit of Life,\* etc.,
etc.\*\* Besides this there are many charming allegories on this subject
scattered through the sacred books of the Brahmins. In one place it is
the female creator who is first a germ, then a drop of heavenly dew, a
pearl, and then an egg. In such cases -- of which there are too many to
enumerate them separately -- the Egg gives birth to the four elements
within the fifth, Ether, and is covered with seven coverings, which
become later on the seven upper and the seven lower worlds. Breaking in
two, the shell becomes the heaven, and the meat in the egg the earth,
the white forming the terres-

"Universal Soul," the astral light of the Kabalist and the Occultist, or
the "Egg of Darkness."

trial waters. Then again, it is Vishnu who emerges from within the egg
with a lotus in his hand. Vinata, a daughter of Daksha and wife of
Kasyapa ("the Self-born sprung from Time," one of the seven "creators"
of our world), brought forth an egg from which was born Garuda, the
vehicle of Vishnu, the latter allegory having a relation to our Earth
only, as Garuda is the Great Cycle.

The egg was sacred to Isis; the priests of Egypt never ate eggs on that
account.\*

Diodorus Siculus states that Osiris was born from an Egg, like Brahma.
From Leda's Egg Apollo and Latona were born, as also Castor and Pollux
-- the bright Gemini. And though the Buddhists do not attribute the same
origin to their Founder, yet, no more than the ancient Egyptians or the
modern Brahmins, do they eat eggs, lest they should destroy the germ of
life latent in them, and commit thereby Sin. The Chinese believe that
their first man was born from an egg, which *Tien*, a god, dropped down
from heaven to earth into the waters.\*\* This symbol is still regarded
by some as representing the idea of the origin of life, which is a
scientific truth, though the human *ovum* is invisible to the naked eye.
Therefore we see respect shown to it from the remotest past, by the
Greeks, Phoenicians, Romans, the Japanese, and the Siamese, the North
and South American tribes, and even the savages of the remotest islands.

With the Egyptians, the concealed god was Ammon (*Mon*). All their gods
were dual: the scientific *reality* for the Sanctuary; its double, the
fabulous and mythical Entity, for the masses. For instance, as observed
in "Chaos, Theos, Kosmos," the older Horus was the *Idea* of the world
remaining in the demiurgic mind "born in Darkness before the creation of
the world;" the *second* Horus\*\*\* was the same *Idea* going forth
from the *Logos*, becoming clothed with matter and assuming an actual
existence. (Compare *Mover*'*s* "*Phoinizer*," *p.* 268.) The same with
*Khnoum* and Ammon;\*\*\*\* both are represented ram-headed, and both
often confused, though their functions are different. Khnoum is "the
modeller of men," fashioning men and things out of the Mundane Egg on a
potter's wheel;

###### \[\[Footnote(s)\]\] -------------------------------------------------

\* Isis is almost always represented holding a lotus in one hand and in
the other a circle and the Cross (*crux ansata*), the Egg being sacred
to her.

\*\* The Chinese seem to have thus anticipated Sir William Thomson's
theory that the first living germ had dropped to the Earth from some
passing comet. Query! why should this be called *scientific* and the
Chinese idea a superstitious, foolish theory?

\*\*\* Horus -- the "older," or *Haroiri*, is an ancient aspect of the
solar god, contemporary with *Ra* and *Shoo;* Haroiri is often mistaken
for Hor (Horsusi), Son of Osiris and Isis. The Egyptians very often
represented the rising Sun under the form of Hor the older, rising from
a full-blown lotus, the Universe, when the solar disc is always found on
the hawk-head of that god. Haroiri is Khnoum.

\*\*\*\* Ammon or *Mon*, the "hidden," the Supreme Spirit.

Ammon-Ra, the generator, is the secondary aspect of the concealed deity.
Khnoum was adored at Elephanta and Philoe,\* Ammon at Thebes. But it is
Emepht, the One, Supreme *Planetary* principle, who blows the egg out of
his mouth, and who is, therefore, Brahma. The shadow of the deity,
Kosmic and universal, of that which broods over and permeates the egg
with its vivifying Spirit until the germ contained in it is ripe, was
the *mystery* god whose name was unpronounceable. It is Phtah, however,
"he who opens," the opener of life and Death,\*\* who proceeds from the
egg of the world to begin his dual work. (*Book of Numbers.*)

According to the Greeks, the phantom form of the Chemis (*Chemi*,
ancient Egypt) which floats on the ethereal waves of the Empyrean
Sphere, was called into being by Horus-Apollo, the Sun god, who caused
it to evolve out of the Mundane egg.\*\*\*

In the Scandinavian Cosmogony -- placed by Professor Max Muller, in
point of time, as "far anterior to the Vedas" in the poem of Voluspa
(the song of the prophetess), the Mundane egg is again discovered in the
phantom-germ of the Universe, which is represented as lying in the
*Ginnungagap* -- the cup of illusion (*Maya*) the boundless and void
abyss. In this world's matrix, formerly a region of night and
desolation, *Nebelheim* (the mist-place, the *nebular* as it is called
now, in the astral light) dropped a *ray of cold light* which overflowed
this cup and froze in it. Then the *Invisible* blew a scorching wind
which dissolved the frozen waters and cleared the mist. These waters
(chaos), called the streams of *Elivagar*, distilling in vivifying
drops, fell down and created the earth and the giant *Ymir*, who only
had "the semblance of man" (the Heavenly man), and the cow, *Audhumla*
(the "mother" or astral light, Cosmic Soul) from whose udder flowed
*four* streams of milk (the four cardinal points: the four heads of the
four rivers of Eden, etc., etc.) and which "four" allegorically are
symbolized by the *cube* in all its various and mystical meanings.

The Christians -- especially the Greek and Latin Churches -- have fully
adopted the symbol, and see in it a commemoration of life eternal,

\* His triadic goddesses are *Sati* and *Anouki.*

\*\* *Phtah* was originally the god of death, of *destruction*, like
Siva. He is a *solar* god only by virtue of the sun's fire killing as
well as vivifying. He was the national god of Memphis, the radiant and
"fair-faced God." (See *Saqquarah Bronzes*, *Saitic Epoch.*)

\*\*\* The *Brahmanda Purana* contains the mystery about Brahma's golden
egg fully; and this is why, perhaps, it is inaccessible to the
Orientalists, who say that this Purana, like the Skanda, is "no longer
procurable in a collective body," but "is represented by a variety of
Khandas and Mahatmyas professing to be derived from it." The "Brahmanda
Purana" is described as "that which is declared in 12,200 verses, the
magnificence of the egg of Brahma, and in which an account of the future
Kalpas is contained as revealed by Brahma." Quite so, and much more,
perchance.

of salvation and of resurrection. This is found in and corroborated by
the time-honoured custom of exchanging "Easter Eggs." From the
*anguinum*, the "Egg" of the "pagan" Druid, whose name alone made Rome
tremble with fear, to the red Easter Egg of the Slavonian peasant, a
cycle has passed. And yet, whether in civilized Europe, or among the
abject savages of Central America, we find the same archaic, primitive
thought; if we only search for it and do not disfigure -- in the
haughtiness of our fancied mental and physical superiority -- the
original idea of the symbol.
