#### IS PLEROMA SATAN'S LAIR?

**T**HE subject is not yet exhausted, and has to be examined from still
other aspects.

Whether Milton's grandiose description of the three Days' Battle of the
Angels of Light against those of Darkness justifies the suspicion that
he must have heard of the corresponding Eastern tradition -- it is
impossible to say. Nevertheless, if not himself in connection with some
Mystic, then it must have been through some one who had obtained access
to the secret works of the Vatican. Among these there is a tradition of
the "Beni Shamash" -- the "children of the Sun" -- concerning the
Eastern allegory, with far more minute details *in its triple*
*version,* than one can get either from the *Book of Enoch,* or the far
more recent Revelation of St. John about the "Old Dragon" and his
various Slayers, as just shown.

It seems inexplicable to find, to this day, authors belonging to
Mystical Societies who yet continue in their preconceived doubts as to
the "alleged" antiquity of the "Book of Enoch." Thus, while the author
of the "Sacred Mysteries among the Mayas and Quiches" is inclined to see
in Enoch an Initiate converted to Christianity (! !) (*vide* p. 16), the
English compiler of Eliphas Levi's works -- "The Mysteries of Magic" --
is also of a like opinion. He remarks that: "Outside the erudition of
Dr. Kenealy, no modern scholarship attributes any more remote antiquity
to the latter work (the 'Book of Enoch') than the fourth century
**B.C**." (*Biograph. and Critical Essay, p. xxxviii.*)*.* Modern
scholarship has been guilty of worse errors than this one. It seems but
yesterday that the *greatest* literary critics in Europe denied the very
authenticity of that work, together with the Orphic Hymns, and even the
*Book of Hermes* or *Thot,* until whole verses from the latter were
discovered on Egyptian monuments and tombs of the earliest dynasties.
The opinion of Archbishop Laurence is quoted elsewhere.

The "Old Dragon" and Satan, now become singly and collectively the
symbol of, and the theological term for, the "Fallen Angel," is not so
described either in *the original Kabala* (the Chaldean "Book of
Numbers") or in the modern. For the most learned, if not the greatest of
modern Kabalists, namely Eliphas Levi, describes Satan in the following
glowing terms: -- "It is that Angel who was proud enough to believe
himself God; brave enough to buy his independence at the price of
eternal suffering and torture; beautiful enough to have adored

himself in full divine light; strong enough to reign in darkness amidst
agony, and to have built himself a throne on his inextinguishable pyre.
It is the Satan of the Republican and heretical Milton. . . . . the
prince of anarchy, served by a hierarchy of pure Spirits (! ! ) . . . .
"(*Histoire de la Magie,* 16-17) This description -- one which
reconciles so cunningly theological dogma and the Kabalistic allegory,
and even contrives to include a political compliment in its phraseology
-- is, when read in the right spirit, quite correct.

Yes, indeed; it is this grandest of ideals, this ever-living symbol --
nay apotheosis -- of self-sacrifice for the intellectual independence of
humanity; this ever active Energy protesting against Static Inertia --
the principle to which Self-assertion is a crime, and Thought and the
*Light of Knowledge* odious. It is -- as Eliphas says with unparalleled
justice and irony -- "this pretended hero of tenebrous eternities, who,
slanderously charged with ugliness, is decorated with horns and claws,
which would fit far better his implacable tormentor -- it is he who has
been finally transformed into a serpent -- the red Dragon." But Eliphas
Levi was yet too subservient to his Roman Catholic authorities; one may
add, too jesuitical, to confess that this devil was mankind, and never
had any existence on earth outside of that mankind.\*

In this, Christian theology, although following slavishly in the steps
of Paganism, was only true to its own time-honoured policy. It had to
isolate itself, and to assert its authority. Hence it could not do
better than turn every pagan deity into a devil. Every bright sun-god of
antiquity -- a glorious deity by day, and its own opponent and adversary
by night, named the Dragon of Wisdom, because it was supposed to contain
the germs of night and day -- has now been turned into the antithetical
shadow of God, and has become *Satan* on the sole and unsupported
authority of despotic human dogma. After which all these producers of
light and shadow, all the Sun and the Moon Gods, were cursed, and thus
the one God chosen out of the many, and Satan, were both
anthropomorphised. But theology seems to have lost sight of the human
capacity for discriminating and finally analysing all that is
artificially forced upon its reverence. History shows in every race and
even tribe, especially in the Semitic nations, the natural impulse to
exalt its own tribal deity above all others to the hegemony

\* What *devil* could be possessed of more cunning, craft and cruelty
than the "Whitechapel murderer" "Jack the Ripper" of 1888, whose
unparalleled blood-thirsty and cool wickedness led him to slaughter and
mutilate in cold blood seven unfortunate and *otherwise* innocent women!
One has but to read the daily papers to find in those wife and
child-beating, drunken brutes (husbands and fathers!), a *small*
percentage of whom is daily brought before the courts, the complete
personifications of the devils of Christian Hell!

of the gods; and proves that the God of the Israelites was such a
*tribal* *God,* and no more, even though the Christian Church, following
the lead of the "chosen" people, is pleased to enforce the worship of
that one particular deity, and to anathematize all the others. Whether
originally a conscious or an unconscious blunder, nevertheless, it *was*
one. Jehovah has ever been in antiquity only "a god *among* other
*Gods,*" (lxxxii. *Psalm).* The *Lord* appears to Abraham, and while
saying, "I am the *Almighty God,*" yet adds, "I will establish my
covenant to be a God unto thee" (Abraham), and unto his *seed after him
(Gen.* xvii. 7) -- not unto Aryan Europeans.

But then, there was the grandiose and ideal figure of Jesus of Nazareth
to be set off against a dark background, to gain in radiance by the
contrast; *and a darker one the Church could hardly invent.* Lacking the
Old Testament symbology, ignorant of the real connotation of the name of
Jehovah -- the rabbinical secret substitute for the ineffable and
unpronounceable name -- the Church mistook the cunningly fabricated
shadow for the reality, the anthropomorphized *generative* symbol for
the one Secondless Reality, the ever unknowable cause of all. As a
logical sequence the Church, for purposes of duality, had to invent an
anthropomorphic Devil -- created, as taught by her, by God himself.
Satan has now turned out to be the monster fabricated by the
"Jehovah-Frankenstein," -- his father's curse and a thorn in the divine
side -- a monster, than whom no earthly Frankenstein could have
fabricated a more ridiculous bogey.

The author of "New Aspects of Life" describes the Jewish God very
correctly from the Kabalistic stand-point as "the Spirit of the Earth,
which had revealed itself to the Jew as Jehovah" (*p*. 209). "It was
that Spirit again who, after the death of Jesus, assumed his form and
personated him as the risen Christ" -- the doctrine of Cerinthius and
several Gnostic sects with slight variation, as one can see. But the
author's explanations and deductions are remarkable: "None knew . . .
better than Moses . . . and so well as he how great was the power of
those (gods of Egypt) with whose priests he had contended," he says . .
. "the gods of which Jehovah is claimed to be the God" (by the Jews
only). "What were these gods, these *Achar* of which Jehovah, the
*Achad,* is claimed to be the God . . . by overcoming them?" the author
asks; to which our Occultism answers: "those whom the Church now calls
the *Fallen Angels* and collectively *Satan,* the *Dragon,* overcome, if
we have to accept *her* dictum, by Michael and the Host, that Michael
being simply Jehovah himself, one of the subordinate Spirits at best."
Therefore, the author is again right in saying: "The Greeks believed in
the existence of . . . *daimons.* But . . . they were anticipated by the
Hebrews, who held *that*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

###### \[\[Vol. 2, Page\]\] 509 JEHOVAH, A PERSONATING SPIRIT.

*there was a class of personating spirits* which they designated
*demons,* 'personators.' Admitting with Jehovah, who expressly asserts
it, the existence of other gods, which were personators of the One God,
were these other gods simply a higher class of personating spirits,
which had acquired and exercised greater powers? And is not personation
*the Key* *to the mystery of the Spirit state?* But once granting this
position, *how are we to know that Jehovah was not a personating
Spirit,* a Spirit which arrogated to itself that it was, and thus
became, the personator of the one unknown and unknowable God? Nay, how
do we know that the Spirit calling itself Jehovah, in arrogating to
itself his attributes did not thus cause its own designation to be
imputed to the One who is in reality as nameless as incognizable?"
(*pp*. 144-145.)

Then the author shows "that the Spirit Jehovah *is* a personator" on its
own admission. It acknowledged to Moses "that it had appeared to the
patriarchs as *the God Shaddai"* . . . . and "the *god Helion*" *. . .
.* With the same breath it assumed the name of Jehovah; and it is on the
faith of the assertion of this personator that the names *El, Eloah,*
*Elohim,* and *Shaddai,* have been read and interpreted in juxtaposition
with Jehovah as "the Lord God Almighty." Then when the name Jehovah
became ineffable . . . . the designation *Adonai,* "Lord" was
substituted for it, and" . . . . it was owing to this substitution that
the 'Lord' passed from the Jewish to the Christian 'Word' and 'World' as
a designation of God" (*p*. 146). And how are we to know, the author may
add, that Jehovah was not many spirits personating even that seemingly
one -- *Jod* or Jod-He?

But if the Christian Church was the first to make the existence of Satan
a dogma, it was because, as shown in *Isis,* the Devil -- the powerful
*enemy of God* (? ! !) had to become the corner stone of the pillar of
the Church. For, as a Theosophist, M. Jules Baissac, truly observes in
his *"Satan ou le Diable"* (*p.* 9): "Il fallait eviter de paraitre
autoriser le dogme du double principe en faisant de ce Satan createur
une puissance reelle, et pour expliquer le mal originel, on profere
contre Manes l'hypothese d'une permission de l'unique tout Puissant."\*
The choice and policy were unfortunate, anyhow. Either the personator of
the lower god of Abraham and Jacob ought to have been made entirely
distinct from the mystic "Father" of Jesus, or -- the "Fallen" Angels
should have been left unslandered by further fictions.

Every god of the Gentiles is connected with, and closely related to,

\* After the polymorphic Pantheism of some Gnostics came the esoteric
*dualism* of Manes, who was accused of personifying *Evil* and creating
of the Devil a God -- rival of God himself. We do not see that the
Christian Church has so much improved on that exoteric idea of the
Manicheans, for she calls God her King of Light, and Satan, the King of
Darkness, to this day.

###### \[\[Vol. 2, Page\]\] 510 THE SECRET DOCTRINE

Jehovah -- the *Elohim*; for they are all One *Host*, whose units differ
only in name in the esoteric teachings. Between the "Obedient" and the
"Fallen" Angels there is no difference whatever, except in their
respective functions, or rather in the inertia of some, and the activity
of others among those "Dhyan Chohans" or *Elohim* who were
"*commissioned to create*," *i.e*., to fabricate the manifested world
out of the eternal material.

The Kabbalists say that the true name of Satan is that of Jehovah placed
upside down, for "Satan is not a black god but the negation of the white
deity," or the *light of Truth*. God is light and Satan is the necessary
darkness or *shadow* to set it off, without which pure light would be
invisible and incomprehensible.\* "For the initiates," says Eliphas
Levi, "the devil is not a person but a creative Force, for Good as for
Evil." They (the Initiates) represented this Force, which presides at
physical generation, under the mysterious form of God *Pan* -- or
Nature: whence the horns and hoofs of that mythical and symbolic figure,
as also the Christian "goat of the Witches' Sabbath." With regard to
this too, Christians have imprudently forgotten that the goat was also
the victim selected for the atonement of all the sins of Israel, that
the *scape-goat* was indeed the sacrificial martyr, the symbol of the
greatest mystery on earth -- the *Fall* into generation. Only the Jews
have long forgotten the real meaning of their (to the non-initiated)
ridiculous hero, selected from the drama of life in the great mysteries
enacted by them in the desert; and the Christians never knew it.

Eliphas Levi seeks to explain the dogma of his Church by paradoxes and
metaphors, but succeeds very poorly in the face of the many volumes
written by pious Roman Catholic demonologists under the approbation and
auspices of Rome, in this nineteenth century of ours. For the true Roman
Catholic, the devil or Satan is *a reality*; the drama enacted in the
sidereal light according to the seer of Patmos -- who desired, perhaps,
to improve upon the narrative in the "Book of Enoch" -- is as real, and
as historical a fact as any other allegory and symbolical event in the
Bible. But the Initiates give an explanation

###### \[\[Footnote(s)\]\] -------------------------------------------------

\* To quote in this relation Mr. Laing in his admirable work "Modern
Science and Modern Thought" (*p*. 222, 3*rd Ed.*): "From this dilemma
(existence of evil in the world) there is no escape, unless we give up
altogether the idea of an anthropomorphic deity, and adopt frankly the
Scientific idea of a First Cause, inscrutable and past finding out; and
of a universe whose laws we can trace, but of whose real essence we know
nothing, *and can only suspect, or faintly discern a fundamental law
which may make the polarity of good and evil a necessary condition of
existence*." Were Science to know "the real essence," instead of knowing
nothing of it, the faint suspicion would turn into the certitude of the
existence of *such a law*, and the knowledge that this law is connected
with Karma.

which differs from that given by Eliphas Levi, whose genius and crafty
intellect had to submit to a certain compromise dictated to him from
Rome.

Thus, the true and *uncompromising* Kabalists admit that, for all
purposes of Science and philosophy, it is enough that the profane should
know that the great magic agent called by the followers of the Marquis
de St. Martin -- the Martinists -- astral light, by the mediaeval
Kabalists and Alchemists the Sidereal Virgin and the *Mysterium Magnum,*
and by the Eastern Occultists AEther, the reflection of *Akasa --* is
that which the Church calls *Lucifer.* That the Latin scholastics have
succeeded in transforming the universal soul and Pleroma, the *vehicle
of Light* and the receptacle of all the forms, a force spread throughout
the whole Universe, with its direct and indirect effects, into Satan and
his works, is no news to any one. But now they are prepared to give out
to the above-mentioned profane even the secrets hinted at by Eliphas
Levi without *adequate* *explanation;* for the latter's policy of veiled
revelations could only lead to further superstition and
misunderstanding. What, indeed, can a student of Occultism, a
*beginner,* gather from the following highly poetical sentences of
Eliphas Levi, as apocalyptic as the writings of any of the Alchemists?

> *"Lucifer,* the Astral Light . . . . is an intermediate force existing
> in all creation, it serves to create and to destroy, and the Fall of
> Adam was an erotic intoxication which has rendered his generation a
> slave to this fatal light . . . every sexual passion that overpowers
> our senses is a whirlwind of that light which seeks to drag us towards
> the abyss of death, Folly. Hallucinations, visions, ecstasies are all
> forms of a very dangerous excitation due to this *interior*
> *phosphorus* (?)*.* Thus light, finally, is of the nature of fire, the
> intelligent use of which warms and vivifies, and the excess of which,
> on the contrary, dissolves and annihilates. Thus man is called upon to
> assume a sovereign empire over that (astral) light and conquer thereby
> his immortality, and is threatened at the same time with being
> intoxicated, absorbed, and eternally destroyed by it. This light,
> therefore, inasmuch as it is devouring, revengeful, and fatal, would
> thus really be hell-fire, the serpent of the legend; the tormented
> errors of which it is full, the tears and the gnashing of teeth of the
> abortive beings it devours, the phantom of life that escapes them, and
> seems to mock and insult their agony, all this would be the devil or
> Satan indeed." (*Histoire de la Magie, p.* 197).

There is no *wrong* statement in all this; nothing save a superabundance
of ill-applied metaphors, as in the application of Adam -- a *myth* --
to the illustration of the astral effects. *Akasa --* the astral light\*
-- can be defined in a few words; it is the universal Soul, the Matrix
of the Universe, the "Mysterium Magnum" from which all that exists is
born by separation or *differentiation.* It is the cause of existence;
it

fills all the infinite Space; *is Space itself*, in one sense, or both
its *Sixth* and Seventh principles.\* But as the finite in the Infinite,
as regards manifestation, this light must have its shadowy side -- as
already remarked. And as the infinite can never be manifested, hence the
finite world has to be satisfied with the *shadow alone*, which its
actions draw upon humanity and which men attract *and force to
activity*. Hence, while it is the *universal Cause* in its unmanifested
unity and infinity, the Astral light becomes, with regard to Mankind,
simply the effects of the causes produced by men in their sinful lives.
It is not its bright denizens --- whether they are called Spirits of
Light or Darkness -- that produce Good or Evil, but mankind itself that
determines the unavoidable action and reaction in the great magic agent.
It is mankind which has become the "Serpent of Genesis," and thus causes
daily and hourly the Fall and sin of the "Celestial Virgin" -- which
thus becomes the Mother of gods and devils at one and the same time; for
she is the ever-loving, beneficent deity to all those who stir her *Soul
and heart*, instead of attracting to themselves her shadowy manifested
essence, called by Eliphas Levi -- "the fatal light" which kills and
destroys. Humanity, in its units, can overpower and master its effects;
but only by the holiness of their lives and by producing good causes. It
has power only on the manifested *lower* principles -- the shadow of the
Unknown and Incognizable Deity in Space. But in antiquity and *reality*,
Lucifer, or *Luciferus*, is the name of the angelic Entity presiding
over the *light of truth* as over the light of the day. In the great
Valentinian gospel *Pistis Sophia* (ยง 361) it is taught that of the
three Powers emanating from the Holy names of the Three
\[\[*Tridunameis*\]\], that of Sophia (the Holy Ghost according to these
gnostics -- the most cultured of all), resides in the planet Venus or
Lucifer.

Thus to the profane, the Astral Light may be God and Devil at once --

###### \[\[Footnote(s)\]\] -------------------------------------------------

\* Says Johannes Tritheim, the Abbot of Spanheim, the greatest
astrologer and Kabalist of his day: -- "The art of divine magic consists
in the ability to perceive the essence of things in the light of nature
(astral light), and by using the soul-powers of the spirit to produce
material things from the unseen universe, and in such operations the
Above and the Below must be brought together and made to act
harmoniously. The spirit of Nature (astral light) is a unity, creating
and forming everything, and acting through the instrumentality of man it
may produce wonderful things. Such are accomplished, if you learn to
know yourself. You will know it by the power of the spirit that is in
yourself, and accomplish it by mixing your spirit with the essence that
comes out of yourself. If you wish to succeed in such a work you must
know how to separate Spirit and Life in Nature, and, moreover, to
separate the astral soul in yourself and to make it tangible, and then
the substance of the soul will appear visibly and tangibly rendered
objective by the power of the spirit." -- (Quoted in Dr. Hartman's
"Paracelsus.")

###### \[\[Vol. 2, Page\]\] 513 MIND, THE QUICKENING SPIRIT.

*Demon est Deus inversus:* that is to say, through every point of
Infinite Space thrill the magnetic and electrical currents of *animate
Nature,* the life-giving and death-giving waves, for death on earth
becomes life on another plane. *Lucifer* is divine and terrestrial
light, the "Holy Ghost" and "Satan," at one and the same time, *visible*
Space being truly filled with the differentiated Breath invisibly; and
the Astral Light, the manifested effects of the two who are one, guided
and attracted by ourselves, is the *Karma* of humanity, both a personal
and impersonal entity: personal, because it is the mystic name given by
St. Martin to the Host of divine Creators, guides and rulers of this
planet; *impersonal,* as the Cause and effect of universal Life and
Death.

The *Fall* was the *result of man's knowledge,* for his "eyes were
opened." Indeed, he was taught Wisdom and the hidden knowledge by the
"Fallen Angel," for the latter had become from that day his *Manas,*
Mind and Self-consciousness. In each of us that golden thread of
continuous life -- periodically broken into active and passive cycles of
sensuous existence on Earth, and super-sensuous in Devachan -- *is* from
the beginning of our appearance upon this earth. It is the *Sutratma,*
the luminous thread of immortal *impersonal* monadship, on which our
earthly lives or evanescent *Egos* are strung as so many beads --
according to the beautiful expression of Vedantic philosophy.

And now it stands proven that Satan, or the Red *Fiery* Dragon, the
"Lord of Phosphorus" (brimstone was a theological improvement), and
*Lucifer,* or "Light-Bearer," is in us: it is our *Mind --* our tempter
and Redeemer, our intelligent liberator and Saviour from pure animalism.
Without this principle -- the emanation of the very essence of the pure
divine principle *Mahat* (Intelligence), which radiates direct from the
*Divine* *mind* -- we would be surely no better than animals. The first
man Adam was made only a *living soul* (nephesh), the last Adam was made
a *quickening Spirit\*:* -- says Paul, his words referring to the
building or *Creation* of man. Without this *quickening* spirit, or
*human Mind* or soul, there would be no difference between man and
beast; as there is none, in fact, between animals with respect to their
actions. The tiger and the donkey, the hawk and the dove, are each one
as pure and as innocent as the other, because *irresponsible.* Each
follows its instinct, the tiger and the hawk killing with the same
unconcern as the donkey eats a thistle, or the dove pecks at a grain of
corn. If the Fall had the significance given to it by theology; if that

\* The real original text of I Corinthians, rendered Kabalistically and
esoterically would read (*in Chap.* xv*., verses* 44 *and* 45): "It is
sown a *soul body* (not 'natural' body), it is raised a *spirit* body."
St. Paul was an Initiate, and his words have quite a different meaning
when read esoterically. The body "is sown in *weakness* (passivity); it
is raised in power" (43) -- or in spirituality and intellect.

###### \[\[Vol. 2, Page\]\] 514 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.

fall occurred as a result of an act never intended by nature, -- a
*sin,* how about the animals? If we are told that they procreate their
species in consequence of that same "original sin," for which God cursed
the earth -- hence everything living on it -- we will put another
question. We are told by theology, as by Science, that the animal was on
earth far earlier than man? We ask the former: How did it *procreate its
species,* before the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge, of the Good and the
Evil, had been plucked off? As said: "The Christians -- far less
clear-sighted than the great Mystic and Liberator whose name they have
assumed, whose doctrines they have misunderstood and travestied, *and
whose memory they have blackened by their deeds --* took the Jewish
Jehovah as he was, and of course strove vainly to reconcile the *Gospel
of Light and Liberty* with the Deity of Darkness and Submission." (*"War
in Heaven."*)*\**

But, it is sufficiently proven now that all the *soi-disant* evil
Spirits who are credited with having made war on the gods, are identical
as personalities; moreover, that all the ancient religions taught the
same tenet save the final conclusion, which latter differs from the
Christian. The seven primeval gods had all a dual state, one essential,
the other accidental. In their essential state they were all the
"Builders" or *Fashioners,* the Preservers and the rulers of this world,
and in the accidental state, clothing themselves in visible
corporeality, they descended on the earth and reigned on it as Kings and
Instructors of the lower Hosts, who had incarnated once more upon it as
men.

the son of a Missionary, G. Mitford was converted to Islam, and died a
Mahomedan in 1884. He was a most extraordinary Mystic, of a great
learning and remarkable intelligence. But he left the Right Path and
forthwith fell under Karmic retribution. As well shown by the author of

Some of these scattered sects have lost even the tradition of the true

Principle of Fire, Light, and Liberty. Why do the Sabean Bedouins

solitude of the desert night yet invoke the starry 'Host of Heaven'? Why
do the Yezidis, the 'Devil Worshippers,' worship the 'Muluk-Taoos' --
The 'Lord Peacock' -- the emblem of pride and of hundred-eyed
intelligence (and of Initiation also), which was expelled from heaven
with Satan, according to an old Oriental tradition? Why do the Gholaites
and their kindred Mesopotamo-Iranian Mohamedan Sects believe in the
'Noor Illahee' -- the Light of the Elohim -- transmitted in *anastasis*

ignorant superstition the traditional religion of the 'Light Deities
whom Jahveh overthrew' (is *said* to have overthrown rather); for by
overthrowing *them* he would have overthrown himself. The'Muluk-Taoos'

Angels, etc.

###### \[\[Vol. 2, Page\]\] 515 THE LOGOS AND SATAN ARE ONE.

Thus, esoteric philosophy shows that man is truly the manifested deity
in both its aspects -- good and evil, but theology cannot admit this
philosophical truth. Teaching the dogma of the Fallen Angels in its
dead-letter meaning, and having made of Satan the corner-stone and
pillar of the dogma of redemption -- to do so would be suicidal. Having
once shown the rebellious angels *distinct from God and the Logos* in
their personalities, the admission that the downfall of the
*disobedient* Spirits meant simply their fall into generation and
matter, would be equivalent to saying that God and Satan were identical.
For since the **L**OGOS (or God) is the aggregate of that once divine
Host accused of having fallen, it would follow that the Logos and Satan
are one.

Yet such was the real philosophical view of the now disfigured tenet in
antiquity. The *Verbum,* or the "Son," was shown in a dual aspect by the
Pagan Gnostics -- in fact, he was a *duality* in full *unity.* Hence,
the endless and various national versions. The Greeks had Jupiter, the
son of Chronos, the Father, who hurls him down into the depths of
Kosmos. The Aryans had Brahma (in later theology) precipitated by Siva
into the Abyss of Darkness, etc., etc. But the fall of all these Logoi
and Demiurgi from their primitive exalted position, had in all cases one
and the same esoteric signification in it; the *curse --* in its
philosophical meaning -- of being incarnated on this earth; an
unavoidable rung on the ladder of cosmic evolution, a highly
philosophical and fitting Karmic law, without which the presence of Evil
on Earth would have to remain for ever a closed mystery to the
understanding of true philosophy. To say, as the author of the *Esprits
Tombes des Paiens* (p. 347) does, that since "Christianity is made to
rest on two pillars, that of evil (\[\[*ponerou*\]\]), and of good
\[\[*Iagathou*\]\]; on two forces, in short, \[\[*Iagathau kai kakai
dunomeis*\]\]: hence, if we suppress the punishment of the *evil
forces,* the protecting mission of the good Powers will have neither
value nor sense" -- is to utter the most unphilosophical absurdity. If
it fits in with, and explains Christian dogma, it obscures the facts and
truths of the primitive wisdom of the ages. The cautious hints of Paul
have all the true esoteric meaning, and it took centuries of scholastic
casuistry to give them the present false colouring in their
interpretation. The *verbum* and *Lucifer* are one in their dual aspect;
and the "Prince of the Air" *(princeps aeris hujus)* is not the "God of
*that* period," but an everlasting principle. If the latter was said to
be ever *circling* around the world -- *qui circumambulat terram --* the
great Apostle referred simply to the never-ceasing cycles of human
incarnations, in which evil will ever predominate unto the day when
Humanity is redeemed by the true divine Enlightenment which gives the
correct perception of things.

forgotten languages, and palm them off as truths and *revealed* facts on
the ignorant masses. The identity of thought and meaning is the one
thing that strikes the student in all the religions which mention the
tradition of the fallen Spirits, and in those great religions there is
not one that fails to mention and describe it in one or another form.
Thus, Hoang-Ty, the great Spirit, sees his Sons, who had acquired
*active* *wisdom,* falling *into the valley of Pain.* Their leader, the
**F**LYING **D**RAGON, having drunk of the forbidden ambrosia, *fell to
the Earth* with his Host (Kings). In the *Zend Avesta,* Angra Mainyu
(Ahriman), surrounding himself with fire (the "Flames" -- *vide supra*)
seeks to conquer the Heavens,\* when Ahura Mazda, descending from the
*solid* Heaven he inhabits, to the help of the Heavens *that revolve*
(in *time* *and space,* the manifested worlds of cycles including those
of incarnation), and the *Amshaspends,* "the seven bright Sravah,"
accompanied by their stars, fight Ahriman, and the vanquished Devas fall
to the Earth along with him. (*Acad. des Inscrip.,* Vol. xxxix., p. 690;
see *Vendidad,* Farg. xix., iii.) In the Vendidad the Daevas are called
"evil-doing," and shown to rush away "into the depths of the world of
hell," or matter. (47.) This is an allegory showing the *Devas*
*compelled to incarnate,* once that they have separated themselves from
their parent essence, or, in other words, after the unit had become a
multiple, after differentiation and manifestation.

Typhon the Egyptian, Python, the Titans, the Suras and the Asuras, all
belong to the same legend of Spirits peopling the Earth. They are not
"*demons* commissioned to create and organize this visible universe,"
but fashioners (the "architects") of the worlds, and the progenitors of
man. They are the *Fallen* angels, metaphorically -- "the true mirrors
of the Eternal Wisdom."

What is the absolute and complete truth as well as the esoteric meaning
about this universal myth? The whole essence of truth *cannot* *be
transmitted from mouth to ear.* Nor can any pen describe it, not even
that of the recording Angel, unless man finds the answer in the
sanctuary of his own heart, in the innermost depths of his divine
intuitions. It is the great **SEVENTH MYSTERY** of Creation, the first
and the last; and those who read St. John's Apocalypse may find its
shadow lurking under the *seventh seal*. . . . It can be represented
only in its apparent, objective form, like the eternal riddle of the
Sphinx. If the latter threw herself into the sea and perished, it is not
because OEdipus *had* unriddled the secret of the ages, but because, by
anthropomorphizing the ever-spiritual and the subjective, he had

\* So does every Yogi and even Christian: one *must take the Kingdom of
heaven by* *violence --* we are taught. Why should such a desire make of
any one a devil?

dishonoured the great truth for ever. Therefore, we can give it only
from its philosophical and intellectual planes, unlocked with three keys
respectively -- for the last four keys of the seven that throw wide open
the portals to the mysteries of Nature are in the hands of the highest
Initiates, and cannot be divulged to the masses at large -- not in this,
our century, at any rate.

The dead letter is everywhere the same. The dualism in the Mazdean
religion, was born from exoteric interpretation. The holy "Airyaman,"
"the bestower of weal," invoked in the prayer called Airyama-ishyo, is
the divine aspect of Ahriman, "the deadly, the Dae of the Daevas" (Farg.
xx., 43), and Angra Mainyu is the dark material aspect of the former.
"Keep us from the Hater, O Mazda and Armaita Spenta" (Vendidad Sadah),
has, as a prayer and invocation, an identical meaning with "Lead us not
into temptation," and is addressed by man to the terrible *Spirit of
duality* in man himself. For (Ahura) Mazda is the spiritual, divine, and
purified man, and Armaita Spenta, the Spirit of the Earth or
materiality, is the same as Ahriman or Angra Mainyu in one sense.

The whole of the Magian or Mazdean literature -- or what remains of it
-- is magical, occult, hence allegorical and symbolical -- even its
"mystery of the law" (see the Gatha in Yasna **XLIV.**). Now the Mobed
and the Parsi keep their eye on the *Baresma* during the sacrifice, the
divine twig off Ormazd's "tree" having been transformed into a bunch of
metallic rods; and wonder why neither the Amesha-Spentas, nor "the high
and beautiful golden Haomas, nor even their Vohu-Mano (good thoughts),
nor their Rata (sacrificial offering)," help them much. Let them
meditate on the "tree of Wisdom," and study, assimilating one by one,
the fruits thereof. The way to the tree of eternal life, the white Homa,
the Gaokerena, is through one end of the earth to the other; and Haoma
is in heaven as it is on earth. But to become once more a priest of it,
and a *healer*, man must heal himself before he can heal others.

This proves once more that the so-called "myths," in order to be at
least approximately dealt with in any degree of justice, have to be
closely examined from all their aspects. In truth, every one of the
*seven* *Keys* has to be used in its right place, and never mixed with
the others, if we would unveil the entire cycle of mysteries. In our day
of dreary soul-killing materialism, the ancient priest Initiates have
become, in the opinion of our learned generations, the synonyms of
clever impostors, kindling the fires of superstition in order to obtain
an easier sway over the minds of men. This is an unfounded calumny,
generated by scepticism and uncharitable thoughts. No one believed more
in Gods -- or, we may call them, the Spiritual and now invisible Powers,
or Spirits,

the *noumena* of the *phenomena* -- than they did; and they believed
just *because they knew.* If, initiated into the Mysteries of Nature,
they were forced to withhold their knowledge from the profane, who would
have surely abused it, such secrecy was undeniably less dangerous than
the policy of their usurpers and successors. The former taught only that
which they well knew. The latter, *teaching what they do not know,* have
invented, as a secure haven for their ignorance, a jealous and cruel
Deity, who forbids man to pry into his mysteries under the penalty of
damnation. As well they may, for *his* mysteries can at best be only
hinted at in polite ears, never described. Turn to King's Gnostics,
"Description of the Plates" (Plate H), and see for yourself what was the
primitive Ark of the Covenant, according to the author, who says: "There
is a Rabbinical tradition that the cherubin placed over it were
represented as male and female, in the act of copulation, in order to
express the grand doctrine of the Essence of *Form* and *Matter,* the
two principles of all things. When the Chaldeans broke into the
sanctuary and beheld this most astounding emblem, they naturally enough
exclaimed, 'Is this your God, of whom you boast that He is such a lover
of purity?' " (p. 441.)

King thinks that this tradition "savours too much of Alexandrian
philosophy to demand any credit," to which we demur. The shape and form
of the wings of the two cherubim standing on the right and left sides of
the Ark, these wings meeting over the "Holy of Holies," are an *emblem*
quite eloquent in itself, besides the "holy" *Jod* within the ark! The
Mystery of Agathadaemon, whose legend states, "I am Chnumis, Sun of the
Universe, 700," can alone solve the mystery of Jesus, the number of
whose name is 888." It is not the key of St. Peter, or the Church dogma,
but the *narthex* -- the wand of the candidate for initiation -- that
has to be wrenched from the grasp of the long-silent Sphinx of the ages.
Meanwhile ----

The augurs, who, upon meeting each other, have to thrust their tongues
into their cheeks to suppress a fit of laughter, may be more numerous in
our own age than they ever were in the day of Sylla.
