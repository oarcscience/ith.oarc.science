**T**HE **R**ACES WITH THE "**T**HIRD **E**YE."

The subject is so unusual, the paths pursued so intricate, so full of
dangerous pitfalls prepared by adverse theories and criticism, that good
reasons have to be given for every step taken. While turning the light
of the bull's eye called esotericism on almost every inch of the occult
grounds travelled over, we have also to use its lens to throw into
stronger objectivity the regions explored by exact science; this, not
only in order to contrast the two, but to defend our position.\*

It may be complained by some that too little is said of the physical,
*human* side of the extinct races, in this history of their growth and
evolution. Much more might be said assuredly, if simple prudence did not
make us hesitate at the threshold of every new revelation. That, which
finds its possibility and landmarks in the discoveries of modern
science, is given; all that of which exact knowledge knows nothing and
upon which it is unable to speculate -- and therefore denies as facts in
nature -- is withheld.

But even such statements as these -- *e.g*., that of all the mammalians,
man was the earliest; that it is man who is the indirect ancestor of the
Ape; and that he was a kind of a Cyclops in days of old -- will all be
contested, yet, scientists will never be able to prove -- except to
their own satisfaction -- that *it was not so.* Nor can they admit that
the first two races of men were too ethereal and phantom-like in their
constitution, organism, and *shape,* even to be called physical men.
For, if they do, it will be found that this is one of the reasons why
their relics can never be expected to be exhumed among other fossils.
Nevertheless all this is maintained. Man was the store-house, so to
speak, of *all the seeds of life*

###### \[\[Footnote(s)\]\] -------------------------------------------------

\* For suggestiveness, we would recommend a short article in the
*Theosophist of* August, 1887, "Esoteric Studies." Its author expounds
therein quite an occult theory, though to the world a new idea: "the
*progress of the Monad* concurring with the *retrogression* of Form"
(666), *i.e*., "with decrease of the *vis formativa.*" He says, "Who
knows what shape vehicled the Ego in remote *rings* (Rounds, or races?)
. . . ? May not man's type have been that of the *Simiadae* in its
variety? Might not the monkey-kingdom of Ramayana fame rest on some
far-off tradition relating to a period when that was the common lot, or
rather aspect, of man?" . . . and winds up a very clever, though too
short, exposition of his theory by saying that which every true
occultist will endorse: "With physico-ethereal man there must be
*involution* of sex. As physico-astral man depended on entities of the
sub-human class (evolved from animal prototypes) for rebirth, so will
physico-ethereal man find among the graceful, shapely orders issuing
from the *air*-plane, one or more which will be developed for his
successive embodiments *when procreated forms are given* -- a process
which will include all mankind only very gradually. The (*pre*?) Adamic
and post-Adamic races were giants; their ethereal counterparts may
possibly be liliputians -- beauteous, luminous, diaphanous -- but will
assuredly be giants in mind" (p. 671, art. by Visconde de Figaniere,
**F.T.S.**).

for this Round, vegetable and animal alike.\* As En-Soph is "One,
*notwithstanding the innumerable forms which are in him*" (*Zohar,*" i.
2l*a*)*,* so is man, on Earth the microcosm of the macrocosm. "As soon
as man appeared, everything was complete. . . . for everything is
comprised in man. He *unites in himself all forms* (*Ibid., iii.*
48*a*)." "The mystery of the *earthly* man is after the mystery of the
Heavenly Man" (*ii.* 76*a*). The human form -- so called, because it is
the vehicle (under whatever shape) of the *divine* man -- is, as so
intuitionally remarked by the author of "Esoteric Studies,"\*\* the *new
type,* at the beginning of every Round, "as man never can be, so he
never has been, manifested in a shape belonging to the animal kingdom
*in esse.*" The author proceeds, "he never formed part of that kingdom.
Derived, only derived, from the most finished class of the latter, a new
human form must always have been the *new* type of the cycle. The human
shape, in one ring (?), as I imagine, becomes cast-off clothes in the
next; it is then appropriated by the highest order in the
servant-kingdom below."

If the idea is what we understand it to mean -- for the "rings" spoken
of throw some confusion upon it -- then it is the correct esoteric
teaching. Having appeared at the very beginning, and at the head of
sentient and conscious life, man (the astral, or the "Soul," for the
Zohar, repeating the archaic teaching, distinctly says that "the *real*
man is the Soul, and his material frame no part of him") -- man became
the living and animal **U**NIT, from which the "cast-off clothes"
determined the shape of every life and animal in this Round.\*\*\*

Thus, he "created" for ages the insects, reptiles, birds, and animals,
unconsciously to himself, from his remains and relics from the Third and
the Fourth Rounds. The same idea and teaching are as distinctly given in
the *Vendidad* of the Mazdeans, as they are in the Chaldean and the
Mosaic allegory of the Ark, all of which are the many national versions
of the original legend given in the Hindu Scriptures. It is found in the
allegory of Vaivasvata Manu and *his* Ark with the Seven Rishis, as in
that of the Rishis, each of whom is shown the father and

###### \[\[Footnote(s)\]\] -------------------------------------------------

\* It may be objected that this is a contradiction. That, as the first
Root-Race appeared 300,000,000 years after the vegetation had evolved,
the seed of vegetable life could not be in the First Race. We say it
could; for up to man's appearance in this Round, the vegetation was of
quite another kind than it is now, and quite ethereal, this for the
simple reason that no grass or plants could have been physical, before
there were animal or other organisms to breathe out the carbonic acid
which vegetation has to imbibe for its development, its nutrition and
growth. They are inter-dependent in their *physical* and achieved forms.

\*\* "Visconde de Figaniere, **F.T.S**." (*The Theosophist,* Aug. 1887,

\*\*\* It is stated in the Zohar that the "primordial worlds" (sparks)
could not continue because *man* *was not as yet.* "*The human* form
contains everything; and as it did not as yet exist, the worlds were
destroyed."

progenitor of specified animals, reptiles, and even monsters (*See
Vishnu* and other *Puranas*)*.* Open the Mazdean *Vendidad,* at Fargard
ii., at verse 27 (73) and read the command of Ormazd to Yima, a Spirit
of the Earth, who symbolizes the three races, after telling him to build
a *vara* ("an enclosure," an *argua* or vehicle) . . . .

"Thither (into the *vara*) thou shalt bring *the seeds of men and*
*women,* of the greatest, best, and finest kinds on this earth; thither
thou shalt bring the seeds of every kind of cattle," etc., etc.; and v.
28 (74) . . . ."all those seeds shalt thou bring, two of every kind, *to
be kept inexhaustible there,* so long *as those men shall stay in the
vara.*" Those "men" in the "Vara" are the "Progenitors," the heavenly
men or Dhyani, the future *Egos* who are commissioned to inform mankind.
For "Vara," or the "Ark" (or again the Vehicle) simply means MAN.\*
Verse 30 says: . . . . "thou shalt seal up the vara (after filling it up
with the seeds), and thou shalt make a door and a *window self-shining
within,*" which is the Soul. And when Yima inquires of Ahura Mazda how
he shall manage to make that *vara*, he is answered: "Crush the earth .
. . and knead it with thy hands, as the potter does when kneading the
potter's clay" (31).

The Egyptian ram-headed god makes man of clay on a potter's wheel, and
so in Genesis do the Elohim fashion him out of the same material.

When the "Maker of the material world" (Ahura Mazda) is asked,
furthermore, what is to give light "to the *Vara* which Yima made," he
is told that "There are *uncreated* lights and *created* lights" and
that "there" (in Airyana Vaego, where *Vara* is built), "the stars, the
moon, and the Sun are only once (a year) seen to rise and set" and a
year seems only as a day (and night) a clear reference to the "land of
the Gods" or the (now) polar regions. Moreover another hint is contained
in this verse: a distinct allusion to the "uncreated lights" which
enlighten man within -- his principles. Otherwise, no sense or reason
could be found in Ahura Mazda's answer (*V.* 40), which is forthwith
followed by Verse 41 saying that "Every fortieth year, to every couple
(hermaphrodite) *two are born, a male and female,"\*\** the latter being
a distinct echo of the Secret Doctrine, of a Stanza which says --

###### \[\[Footnote(s)\]\] -------------------------------------------------

\* This is the meaning when the allegory and symbol are opened and read
by means of the *human* key, or the key to terrestrial anthroposophy.
This interpretation of the "ark" symbolism does not in the least
interfere with its astronomical, or even theogonic keys; nor with any of
the other six meanings. Nor does it seem less scientific than the modern
theories about the origin of man. As said, it has seven keys to it, like
the rest.

"*At the expiration of every forty* (*annual*) *Suns, at the end of
every* *fortieth Day, the double one becomes four*; *male and female in
one, in the* *first and second and the third*. . . . . ."

Which is clear, since "every sun" meant a whole year, the latter being
composed of one day then, as in the arctic circle it is now composed of
six months. According to the old teaching, the axis of the earth
gradually changes its inclination to the ecliptic, and at the period
referred to, this inclination was such that a polar day lasted during
the whole period of the earth's revolution about the sun, when a kind of
twilight of very short duration intervened; after which the polar land
resumed its position directly under the solar rays. This may be contrary
to astronomy as now taught and understood: but who can say that changes
in the motion of the earth, which do not take place now, did not occur
millions of years back?

Returning once more to the statement that *Vara* meant the MAN of the
Fourth Round, as much as the Earth of those days, the moon, and even
Noah's ark, if one will so have it -- this is again shown in the
dialogue between Ahura Mazda and Zarathustra. Thus when the latter asks
--

*V.* 42. "O Maker of the Material World, thou Holy One! Who is he who
brought the law of Mazda into the *Vara* which Yima made?"

"Ahura Mazda answered: 'It was the bird Karshipta, O holy Zarathustra.'
. . . ."

"The bird Karshipta dwells in the heavens: were he living on the earth
he would be king of birds. He brought into the var of Yima, and recites
the Avesta *in the language of birds.*" (*Bund. xix and xxiv.*)

This again is an allegory and a symbol misunderstood by the Orientalists
only, who see in this bird "an incarnation of lightning," and say its
song was "often thought to be the utterance of a god and a revelation,"
and what not. Karshipta is the human mind-soul, and the deity thereof,
symbolized in ancient Magianism by a bird, as the Greeks symbolized it
by a butterfly. No sooner had Karshipta entered the *Vara* or man, than
he understood the law of Mazda, or Divine Wisdom. In the "Book of
Concealed Mystery" it is said of the tree, which is the tree of
knowledge of good and evil: "In its branches (of the tree) the birds
lodge and build their nests," or *the Souls* and the Angels have their
place!.\* Therefore, with the Kabalists it was a like symbol. "Bird" was
a Chaldean, and has become a Hebrew synonym and symbol for Angel, a
Soul, a Spirit, or Deva; and the "Bird's Nest" was with both Heaven, and
is God's bosom in the *Zohar.* The perfect Messiah enters Eden "into
that place which is called the Bird's Nest" (Zohar, ii., 8*b*).

"Like a bird that is flying from its nest, and that is the Soul from
which the Shekeenah (divine wisdom or grace) does not move away" (Zohar,
iii., 278*a*; Myer's Qabbalah, 217). "The Nest of the eternal Bird, the
flutter of whose wings produces life, is boundless space," says the
Commentary, meaning Hansa, the bird of Wisdom.

It is Adam Kadmon who is the (Sephirothal) tree, and it is he who
becomes the "Tree of knowledge of good and evil" esoterically. And that
"tree hath around it seven columns (seven pillars) of the world, or
*Rectores*"; the same "*Progenitors*" or "*Sephiroth*" again "operating
through the respective orders of Angels in the spheres of the seven
planets," etc., one of which orders begets giants (*Nephilim*) on Earth.

It was the belief of entire antiquity, Pagan and Christian, that the
earliest mankind was a race of giants. Certain excavations in America in
mounds and in caves, have already yielded in isolated cases groups of
skeletons of nine and twelve feet high.\* These belong to tribes of the
early Fifth Race, now degenerated to an average size of between five and
six feet. But we can easily believe that the Titans and Cyclopes of old
really belonged to the Fourth (Atlantean) Race, and that all the
subsequent legends and allegories found in the Hindu Puranas and the
Greek Hesiod and Homer, were based on the hazy reminiscences of real
Titans -- men of a superhuman tremendous physical power, which enabled
them to defend themselves, and hold at bay the gigantic monsters of the
Mesozoic and early Cenozoic times -- and of actual Cyclopes --
three-eyed mortals.

It has been often remarked by observant writers, that the "origin of
nearly every popular myth and legend could be traced invariably to a
fact in Nature."

In these fantastic creations of an exuberant subjectivism, there is
always an element of the objective and real. The imagination of the
masses, disorderly and ill-regulated as it may be, could never have
conceived and fabricated *ex nihilo* so many monstrous figures, such a
wealth of extraordinary tales, had it not had, to serve it as a central
nucleus, those floating reminiscences, obscure and vague, which unite
the broken links of the chain of time to form with them the mysterious,
dream foundation of our collective consciousness.\*\*

###### \[\[Footnote(s)\]\] -------------------------------------------------

\* Darwinian Evolutionists who are so wont to refer to the evidence of
*reversion to* *type* -- the full meaning of which, in the case of human
monsters, is embraced in the esoteric solution of the embryological
problem -- as proof of their arguments, would do well to inquire into
those instances of *modern giants* who are often 8, 9, and even 11 feet
high. Such *reversions* are imperfect, yet undeniable reproductions of
the original towering man of primeval times.

\*\* See "*Mythical Monsters,*" by Ch. Gould, from whose interesting and
scientific volume a few passages are quoted further on. See in Mr.
Sinnett's "*Occult World,*" the description of a cavern in the Himalayas
filled with relics of human and animal giant bones.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

###### \[\[Vol. 2, Page\]\] 294 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.

The evidence for the Cyclopes -- a race of giants -- will be pointed out
in forthcoming Sections, in the Cyclopean remnants, so called to this
day. An indication that, during its evolution and before the final
adjustment of the human organism -- which became perfect and symmetrical
only in the Fifth Race -- the early Fourth Race may have been
three-eyed, without having necessarily a third eye in the middle of the
brow, like the legendary Cyclops, is also furnished by Science.

To the Occultists who believe that spiritual and psychic *involution*
proceeds on parallel lines with physical *evolution*; that the *inner*
senses -- innate in the first human races -- atrophied during racial
growth and the material development of the outer senses; to the student
of Esoteric symbology, finally, this statement is no conjecture or
possibility, but simply *a phase of the law of growth, a proven fact,*
in short. They understand the meaning of this passage in the
*Commentaries* which says: --

"*There were four-armed human creatures in those early days of the*
*male-females* (hermaphrodites); *with one head, yet three eyes. They*
*could see before them and behind them.\* A* **K**ALPA *later* (after
the separation of the sexes) *men having fallen into matter, their
spiritual vision* *became dim*; *and coordinately the third eye
commenced to lose its power.* . . . *When the Fourth* (*Race*) *arrived
at its middle age, the inner vision* *had to be awakened, and* acquired
by artificial stimuli, *the process of* *which was known to the old
sages.\*\** . . . *The third eye, likewise, getting* *gradually*
PETRIFIED*,\*\*\* soon disappeared. The double-faced became the*
*one-faced, and the eye was drawn deep into the head and is now buried*
*under the hair. During the activity of the inner man* (during trances
and spiritual visions) *the eye swells and expands. The Arhat sees and
feels* *it, and regulates his action accordingly*. . . . . . . . . . . .
. .

###### \[\[Footnote(s)\]\] -------------------------------------------------

\* Viz., the third eye was at the back of the head. The statement that
the latest hermaphrodite humanity was "four-armed," unriddles probably
the mystery of all the representations and idols of the exoteric gods of
India. On the Acropolis of Argos, there was a \[\[*Zoanon*\]\], a rudely
carved wooden statue (attributed to Daedalus), representing a three-eyed
colossus, which was consecrated to Zeus *Triopas* (three-eyed). The head
of the "god" has two eyes in its face and one above on the top of the
forehead. It is considered the most archaic of all the ancient statues
(*Schol. Vatic. ad Eurip. Troad.* 14).

\*\* The *Inner* *sight* could henceforth be acquired only through
training and initiation, save in the cases of "natural and born
magicians," sensitives and mediums, as they are called now.

\*\*\* This expression "petrified" instead of "ossified" is curious. The
"back eye," which is of course the *pineal gland,* now so-called, the
small pea-like mass of grey nervous matter attached to the back of the
third ventricle of the brain, is said to almost invariably contain
*mineral concretions* and *sand*, and "nothing more." (*Vide Infra.*)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

###### \[\[Vol. 2, Page\]\] 295 OCCULT PHYSIOLOGY.

*The undefiled* Lanoo (disciple, chela) *need fear no danger*; *he who
keeps* *himself not in purity* (who is not chaste) *will receive no help
from the* '*deva eye.*' "

Unfortunately not. The "deva-eye" exists no more for the majority of
mankind. The *third eye is dead,* and acts no longer; but it has left
behind a witness to its existence. This witness is now the PINEAL GLAND.
As for the "four-armed" men, it is they who become the prototypes of the
four-armed Hindu gods, as shown in a preceding footnote.

Such is the mystery of the human eye that, in their vain endeavours to
explain and account for all the difficulties surrounding its action,
some scientists have been forced to resort to occult explanations. The
development of the *Human eye* gives more support to the occult
anthropology than to that of the materialistic physiologists. "The eyes
in the human embryo *grow from within without*" out of the brain,
instead of being part of the skin, as in the insects and cuttlefish.
Professor Lankester, thinking the brain a queer place for the eye, and
attempting to explain the phenomenon on *Darwinian lines,* suggests the
curious view that "our" earliest vertebrate ancestor was a *transparent*
creature and hence did not mind where the eye was! And so was man "a
transparent creature" once upon a time, we are taught, hence our theory
holds good. But how does the Lankester hypothesis square with the
Haeckelian view that the vertebrate eye originated by changes *in the
epidermis?* If it started *inside,* the theory goes into the
waste-basket. This seems to be proved by embryology. Moreover, Professor
Lankester's extraordinary suggestion -- or shall we say admission? -- is
rendered perhaps necessary by evolutionist necessities. Occultism with
its teaching as to the gradual development of senses "FROM WITHIN
WITHOUT," from astral prototypes, is far more satisfactory: The *third
eye retreated* *inwards* when its course was run -- another point in
favour of Occultism.

The allegorical expression of the Hindu mystics when speaking of the
"eye of Siva," the *Tri-bochana* ("three-eyed"), thus receives its
justification and *raison d*'*etre -- the* transference of the pineal
gland (once that "third eye") to the forehead, being an exoteric
licence. This throws also a light on the mystery -- incomprehensible to
some -- of the connection between *abnormal,* or Spiritual Seership, and
the physiological purity of the Seer. The question is often asked, "Why
should celibacy and chastity be a *sine qua non* rule and condition of
regular *chelaship, or* the development of psychic and occult powers"
The answer is contained in the Commentary. When we learn that the "third
eye" was once a physiological organ, and that later on, owing to the
gradual

disappearance of spirituality and increase of materiality (Spiritual
nature being extinguished by the physical), it became an atrophied
organ, as little understood now by physiologists as the spleen is --
when we learn this, the connection will become clear. During human life
the greatest impediment in the way of spiritual development, and
especially to the acquirement of *Yoga* powers, is the activity of our
physiological senses. Sexual action being closely connected, by
interaction, with the spinal cord and the grey matter of the brain, it
is useless to give any longer explanation. Of course, the normal and
abnormal state of the brain, and the degree of active work in the
*medulla oblongata,* reacts powerfully on the pineal gland, for, owing
to the number of "centres" in that region, which controls by far the
greater majority of the physiological actions of the animal economy, and
also owing to the close and intimate neighbourhood of the two, there
must be exerted a very powerful "inductive" action by the *medulla* on
the pineal gland.

All this is quite plain to the Occultist, but is very vague in the sight
of the general reader. The latter must then be shown the possibility of
a three-eyed man in nature, in those periods when his formation was yet
in a comparatively chaotic state. Such a possibility may be inferred
from anatomical and zoological knowledge, first of all; then it may rest
on the assumptions of materialistic science itself.

It is asserted upon the authority of Science, and upon evidence, which
is not merely a fiction of theoretical speculation this time, that many
of the animals -- especially among the lower orders of the vertebrata --
have a *third* eye, now atrophied, but necessarily active in its
origin.\* The Hatteria species, a lizard of the order *Lacertilia,*
recently discovered in New Zealand (*a part of ancient Lemuria so
called, mark* *well*)*,* presents this peculiarity in a most
extraordinary manner; and not only the *Hatteria punctata,* but the
chameleon, certain reptiles, and even fishes. It was thought, at first,
that it was no more than the prolongation of the brain ending with a
small protuberance, called epiphysis, a little bone separated from the
main bone by a cartilage, and found in every animal. But it was soon
found to be more than this. It offered -- as its development and
anatomical structure showed -- such an analogy with that of the eye,
that it was found impossible to see in it any-

###### \[\[Footnote(s)\]\] -------------------------------------------------

\* "Deeply placed within the head, covered by thick skin and muscles,
true eyes that cannot see are found in certain animals," also, says
Haeckel: "Vertebrate . . . blind moles and field mice, blind snakes and
lizards. . . . They shun daylight . . . dwelling under the ground. *They
were not originally blind* but have evolved from ancestors that lived in
the light and had well-developed eyes. The atrophied eye beneath the
opaque skin may be found in these blind beings in every stage of
reversion." ("*Sense Organs,*" *Haeckel*.) And if *two* eyes could
become so atrophied in lower animals, why not one eye -- the pineal
gland -- in man, who is but a higher animal in his physical aspect?

thing else. There were and are paleontologists who feel convinced to
this day that this "third eye" has functioned in its origin, and they
are certainly right. For this is what is said of the pineal gland in
Quain's Anatomy (*Vol. II. ninth edit., pp.* 830-851.
"*Thalamencephalon*" *Interbrain*)*: -*-

> "It is from this part, constituting at first the whole and

The above is specially interesting when it is remembered that, were it
not for the development of the hinder part of the cerebral hemispheres
backwards, the pineal gland would be perfectly visible on the removal of
the parietal bones. It is very interesting also to note the obvious
connection to be traced between the (originally) hollow optic tracts and
the eyes anteriorly, the pineal gland and its peduncles behind, and all

of these with the optic thalami. So that the recent discoveries in
connection with the third eye of *Hatteria punctata* have a very
important bearing on the developmental history of the human senses, and
on the occult assertions in the text.

It is well known, (and also regarded as a fiction now, by those who have
ceased to believe in the existence of an immortal principle in man,)
that Descartes saw in the pineal gland the *Seat of the Soul.* Although
it is joined to every part of the body, he said, there is one special
portion of it in which the Soul exercises its functions more specially
than in any other. And, as neither the heart, nor yet the brain could be
that "special" locality, he concluded that it was that little gland tied
to the brain, yet having an action independent of it, as it could easily
be put into a kind of swinging motion "*by the animal* *Spirits\* which
cross* the cavities of the skull in every sense."

Unscientific as this may appear in our day of exact learning, Descartes
was yet far nearer the occult truth than is any Haeckel. For the pineal
gland, as shown, is far more connected with Soul and Spirit than with
the physiological senses of man. Had the leading Scientists a glimmer of
the *real* processes employed by the Evolutionary Impulse, and the
winding *cyclic* course of this great law, they would *know* instead of
conjecturing; and feel as certain of the future physical transformations
of the human kind by the knowledge of its past forms. Then, would they
see the fallacy and all the absurdity of their modern "blind-force" and
mechanical processes of nature; realizing, in consequence of such
knowledge, that the said pineal gland, for instance, could not but be
disabled for *physical* use at this stage of our cycle. If the odd "eye"
in man is now atrophied, it is a proof that, as in the lower animal, it
has once been active; for nature never creates the smallest, the most
insignificant form without some definite purpose and use. It was an
*active* organ, we say, at that stage of evolution when the spiritual
element in man reigned supreme over the hardly nascent intellectual and
psychic elements. And, as the cycle ran down toward that point when the
physiological senses were developed by, and went *pari passu* with, the
growth and consolidation of the physical man, the interminable and
complex vicissitudes and tribulations of zoological development, that
median "eye" ended by atrophying along with the early spiritual and
purely psychic characteristics in man. The eye is the mirror and also
the window of the soul, says popular wisdom,\*\* and *Vox populi Vox
Dei.*

###### \[\[Vol. 2, Page\]\] 299 THE EVOLUTION OF THE EYE.

In the beginning, every class and family of living species was
hermaphrodite and objectively one-eyed. In the animal, whose form was as
ethereal (astrally) as that of man, before the bodies of both began to
evolve their coats of skin, viz., to evolve from *within without* the
thick coating of physical substance or matter with its internal
physiological mechanism -- the third eye was primarily, as in man, the
only seeing organ. The two physical front eyes developed\* later on in
both brute and man, whose organ of physical sight was, at the
commencement of the Third Race, in the same position as that of some of
the blind vertebrata, in our day, *i.e*., beneath an opaque skin.\*\*
Only the stages of the *odd,* or primeval eye, in man and brute, are now
inverted, as the former has already passed that animal *non-rational*
stage in the Third Round, and is ahead of mere brute creation by a whole
plane of consciousness. Therefore, while the "Cyclopean" eye was, and
still *is,* in man the organ of *spiritual* sight, in the animal it was
that of objective vision. And this eye, having performed its function,
was replaced, in the course of physical evolution from the simple to the
complex, by two eyes, and thus was stored and laid aside by nature for
further use in AEons to come.

This explains why the pineal gland reached its highest development
proportionately with the lowest physical development. It is the
vertebrata in which it is the most prominent and objective, and in man
it is

\[\[Footnote continued from previous page\]\] and ethereal without; the
*second,* psycho-spiritual mentally, and ethero-physical bodily; the
*third,* still bereft of intellect in its beginning, is astro-physical
in its body, and lives an inner life, in which the psycho-spiritual
element is in no way interfered with as yet by the hardly nascent
physiological senses. Its two front eyes look before them without seeing
either past or future. But the "third eye" "*embraces ETERNITY.*"

\* But in a very different manner to that pictured by Haeckel as an
"*evolution by* *natural selection in the struggle for existence*"
("*Pedigree of Man.*" "*Sense Organs,*" p. 335). The mere "thermal
sensibility of the skin," to hypothetical light-waves, is absurdly
incompetent to account for the beautiful combination of adaptations
present in the eye. It has, moreover, been previously shown that
"natural Selection" is a pure myth when credited with the *origination*
of variations (*vide infra, Part III., on Darwinian mechanical
causation*); as the "survival of the fittest" can only take place after
useful variations have sprung up, together with improved organisms.
Whence came the "useful variations," which developed the eye? Only from
"blind forces . . . without aim, without design?" The argument is
puerile. The true solution of the mystery is to be found in the
impersonal Divine Wisdom, in its **I**DEATION -- reflected through
matter.

\*\* Palaeontology has ascertained that in the animals of the Cenozoic
age -- the Saurians especially, such as the antediluvian
*Labyrinthodon,* whose fossil skull exhibits a perforation otherwise
inexplicable -- the third, or odd eye must have been much developed.
Several naturalists, among others E. Korscheldt, feel convinced that
whereas, notwithstanding the opaque skin covering it, such an eye in the
reptiles of the present period can only distinguish light from darkness
(as the human eyes do when bound with a handkerchief, or even tightly
closed), in the now extinct animals that eye functioned and was a real
organ of vision.

most carefully hidden and inaccessible, except to the anatomist. No less
light is thrown thereby on the future physical, spiritual, and
intellectual state of mankind, in periods corresponding on parallel
lines with other past periods, and always on the lines of ascending and
descending cyclic evolution and development. Thus, a few centuries
before the *Kali yuga --* the black age which began nearly 5,000 years
ago -- it was said (paraphrased into comprehensible sentences):

"*We* (the Fifth Root-Race) *in our first half* (of duration) *onward*
(on the now ASCENDING arc of the cycle) *are on the mid point of* (or
between) *the First and the Second Races -- falling downward* (*i.e.,*
the races were then on the descending arc of the cycle). . . . .
*Calculate for thyself,* Lanoo, *and see.*" (Commentary xx.).

Calculating as advised, we find that during that transitional period --
namely, in the second half of the First Spiritual ethero-astral race --
nascent mankind was devoid of the intellectual brain element. As it was
on its *descending* line, and as we are parallel to it, on the
*ascending,* we are,

> EVOLUTION OF ROOT RACES IN THE FOURTH ROUND

![](sd2-300.gif)

therefore devoid of the Spiritual element, which is now replaced by the
intellectual. For, remember well, as we are in the *manasa* period of
our cycle of races, or in the Fifth, we have, therefore, crossed the
meridian point of the perfect adjustment of Spirit and Matter -- or that
equilibrium between brain intellect and Spiritual perception. One
important point has, however, to be borne in mind.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

###### \[\[Vol. 2, Page\]\] 301 THE ODD EYE IS NOW A GLAND.

We are only in the Fourth Round, and it is in the Fifth that the full
development of *Manas,* as a direct ray from the Universal MAHAT -- a
ray unimpeded by matter -- will be finally reached. Nevertheless, as
every sub-race and nation have their cycles and stages of developmental
evolution repeated on a smaller scale, it must be the more so in the
case of a Root-Race. Our race then has, as a Root-race, crossed the
equatorial line and is cycling onward on the Spiritual side; but some of
our sub-races still find themselves on the shadowy descending arc of
their respective national cycles; while others again -- the oldest --
having crossed their crucial point, which alone decides whether a race,
a nation, or a tribe will live or perish, are at the apex of spiritual
development as sub-races.

It becomes comprehensible now why the "odd eye" has been gradually
transformed into a simple gland, after the physical Fall of those we
have agreed to call the "Lemurians."

It is a curious fact that it is especially in human beings that the
cerebral hemispheres and the lateral ventricles have been developed, and
that the *optic thalami, corpora quadrigemina,* and *corpora striata*
are the principal parts which are developed in the mammalian brain.
Moreover it is asserted that the intellect of any man may to some extent
be gauged by the development of the central convolutions and the fore
part of the cerebral hemispheres. It would seem a natural corollary that
if the development and increased size of the pineal gland may be
considered to be an index of the astral capacities and spiritual
proclivities of any man, there will be a corresponding development of
that part of the cranium, or an increase in the size of the pineal gland
at the expense of the hinder part of the cerebral hemispheres. It is a
curious speculation which would receive a confirmation in this case. We
should see, below and behind, the cerebellum which has been held to be
the seat of all the animal proclivities of a human being, and which is
allowed by science to be the great centre for all the physiologically
co-ordinated movements of the body, such as walking, eating, etc., etc.;
in front, the fore-part of the brain -- the cerebral hemispheres -- the
part especially connected with the development of the intellectual
powers in man; and in the middle, dominating them both, and especially
the animal functions, the developed pineal gland, in connection with the
more highly evolved, or spiritual man.

It must be remembered that these are only physical correspondences; just
as the ordinary human brain is the registering organ of memory, but not
memory itself.

This is, then, the organ which gave rise to so many legends and
traditions, among others to that of man with one head but two faces.
These may be found in several Chinese works, besides being referred to
in the

Chaldean fragments. Apart from the work already cited -- the Shan Hai
King, compiled by King Chia from engravings on nine urns made 2,255
**B.C**., by the Emperor Yu, they may be found in another work, called
the "Bamboo Books," and in a third one, the "Rh Ya" -- "initiated
according to tradition by Chow Kung, uncle of Wu Wang, the first Emperor
of the Chow Dynasty, **B.C**., 1,122": -- says Mr. Ch. Gould in his
"*Mythical Monsters.*" The Bamboo Books contain the ancient annals of
China, found **A.D**. 279 at the opening of the grave of King Seang of
Wai, who died **B.C**. 295. Both these works mention men with two faces
on one head -- one in front and one behind (*p*. 27).

Now that which the students of Occultism ought to know is that THE
"THIRD EYE" IS INDISSOLUBLY CONNECTED WITH **K**ARMA. The tenet is so
mysterious that very few have heard of it.

The "eye of Siva" did not become entirely atrophied before the close of
the Fourth Race. When spirituality and all the divine powers and
attributes of the deva-man of the Third had been made the hand-maidens
of the newly-awakened physiological and psychic passions of the physical
man, instead of the reverse, the eye lost its powers. But such was the
law of Evolution, and it was, in strict accuracy, no FALL. The sin was
not in using those newly-developed powers, but in *misusing* them; in
making of the tabernacle, designed to contain a god, the fane of every
*spiritual* iniquity. And if we say "sin" it is merely that everyone
should understand our meaning; as the term *Karma\** would be the right
one to use in this case; while the reader who would feel perplexed at
the use of the term "spiritual" instead of "physical" iniquity, is
reminded of the fact that there can be no physical iniquity. The body is
simply the irresponsible organ, the tool of the *psychic,* if not of the
"Spiritual man." While in the case of the Atlanteans, it was precisely
the Spiritual being which sinned, the Spirit element being still the
"Master" principle in man, in those days. Thus it is in those days that
the heaviest Karma of the Fifth Race was generated by our Monads.

As this sentence may again be found puzzling, it is better that it
should be explained for the benefit of those who are ignorant of the
theosophical teachings.

Questions with regard to *Karma* and *re-births* are constantly offered,
and a great confusion seems to exist upon this subject. Those who are
born and bred in the Christian faith, and have been trained in the idea

###### \[\[Footnote(s)\]\] -------------------------------------------------

\* Karma is a word of many meanings, and has a special term for almost
every one of its aspects. It means, as a synonym of sin, the performance
of some action for the attainment of an object of *worldly*, hence
*selfish,* desire, which cannot fail to be hurtful to somebody else.
Karman is action, the Cause; and Karma again is "the law of ethical
causation"; the *effect* of an act produced egotistically, when the
great law of harmony depends on altruism.

###### \[\[Vol. 2, Page\]\] 303 THE NUMBER OF MONADS IS LIMITED.

that a new soul is created by God for every newly-born infant, are among
the most perplexed. They ask whether in such case the number of
incarnating Monads on earth is limited; to which they are answered in
the affirmative. For, however countless, in our conceptions, the number
of the incarnating monads -- even if we take into account the fact that
ever since the Second Race, when their respective seven groups were
furnished with bodies, several births and deaths may be allowed for
every second of time in the aeons already passed -- still, there must be
a limit. It was stated that Karma-Nemesis, whose bond-maid is Nature,
adjusted everything in the most harmonious manner; and that, therefore,
the fresh pouring-in, or arrival of new Monads, had ceased as soon as
Humanity had reached its full physical development. No fresh Monads have
incarnated since the middle-point of the Atlanteans. Hence, remembering
that, save in the case of young children, and of individuals whose lives
were violently cut off by some accident, no Spiritual Entity can
re-incarnate before a period of many centuries has elapsed, such gaps
alone must show that the number of Monads is necessarily finite and
limited. Moreover, a reasonable time must be given to other animals for
their evolutionary progress.

Hence the assertion that many of us are now working off the effects of
the evil Karmic causes produced by us in Atlantean bodies. The Law of
**K**ARMA is inextricably interwoven with that of Re-incarnation.

It is only the knowledge of the constant re-births of one and the same
individuality throughout the life-cycle; the assurance that the same
**M**ONADS -- among whom are many Dhyan-Chohans, or the "Gods"
themselves -- have to pass through the "Circle of Necessity," rewarded
or punished by such rebirth for the suffering endured or crimes
committed in the former life; that those very Monads, which entered the
empty, senseless shells, or astral figures of the First Race emanated by
the Pitris, are the same who are now amongst us -- nay, ourselves,
perchance; it is only this doctrine, we say, that can explain to us the
mysterious problem of Good and Evil, and reconcile man to the terrible
and *apparent* injustice of life. Nothing but such certainty can quiet
our revolted sense of justice. For, when one unacquainted with the noble
doctrine looks around him, and observes the inequalities of birth and
fortune, of intellect and capacities; when one sees honour paid fools
and profligates, on whom fortune has heaped her favours by mere
privilege of birth, and their nearest neighbour, with all his intellect
and noble virtues ---far more deserving in every way --perishing of want
and for lack of sympathy; when one sees all this and has to turn away,
helpless to relieve the undeserved suffering, one's ears ringing and
heart aching with the cries of

pain around him -- that blessed knowledge of Karma alone prevents him
from cursing life and men, as well as their supposed Creator.\*

Of all the terrible blasphemies and accusations virtually thrown on
their God by the Monotheists, none is greater or more unpardonable than
that (almost always) false humility which makes the presumably "pious"
Christian assert, in connection with every evil and undeserved blow,
that "such *is the will* of God."

Dolts and hypocrites! Blasphemers and impious Pharisees, who speak in
the same breath of the endless merciful love and care of their God and
creator for helpless man, and of that God *scourging the good, the*
*very best of his creatures, bleeding them to death like an insatiable*
*Moloch!* Shall we be answered to this, in Congreve's words: --

"But who shall dare to tax Eternal Justice?" *Logic and simple* *common
sense,* we answer: if we are made to believe in the "original Sin," in
*one* life, on this Earth only, for every Soul, and in an
anthropomorphic Deity, who seems to have created some men only for the
pleasure of condemning them to eternal hell-fire (and this whether they
are good or bad, says the Predestinarian),\*\* why should not every man
endowed with reasoning powers condemn in his turn such a villainous
Deity? Life would become unbearable, if one had to believe in the God
created by man's unclean fancy. Luckily he exists only in human dogmas,
and in the unhealthy imagination of some poets, who believe they have
solved the problem by addressing him as --

> "Thou great Mysterious Power, who hast *involved*  
> The pride of human wisdom, *to confound*  
> The *daring scrutiny* and prove *the faith*  
> Of thy *presuming* creatures! . . . ."

Truly a robust "faith" is required to believe that it is "presumption"
to question the justice of one, who creates helpless little man but to
"perplex" him, and to test a "faith" with which that "Power," moreover,
may have forgotten, if not neglected, to endow him, as happens
sometimes.

Compare this blind faith with the philosophical belief, based on every
reasonable evidence and life-experience, in Karma-Nemesis, or the Law of
Retribution. This Law -- whether Conscious or Uncon-

Schopenhauer and Von Hartmann.

scious -- predestines nothing and no one. It exists from and in
Eternity, truly, for it is **E**TERNITY itself; and as such, since no
act can be co-equal with eternity, it cannot be said to act, for it is
ACTION itself. It is not the Wave which drowns a man, but the *personal*
action of the wretch, who goes deliberately and places himself under the
*impersonal* action of the laws that govern the Ocean's motion. Karma
creates nothing, nor does it design. It is man who plans and creates
causes, and Karmic law adjusts the effects; which adjustment is not an
act, but universal harmony, tending ever to resume its original
position, like a bough, which, bent down too forcibly, rebounds with
corresponding vigour. If it happen to dislocate the arm that tried to
bend it out of its natural position, shall we say that it is the bough
which broke our arm, or that our own folly has brought us to grief?
Karma has never sought to destroy intellectual and individual liberty,
like the God invented by the Monotheists. It has not involved its
decrees in darkness purposely to perplex man; nor shall it punish him
who dares to scrutinise its mysteries. On the contrary, he who unveils
through study and meditation its intricate paths, and throws light on
those dark ways, in the windings of which so many men perish owing to
their ignorance of the labyrinth of life, is working for the good of his
fellow-men. **K**ARMA is an Absolute and Eternal law in the World of
manifestation; and as there can only be one Absolute, as One eternal
ever present Cause, believers in Karma cannot be regarded as Atheists or
materialists -- still less as fatalists:"

###### \[\[Footnote(s)\]\] -------------------------------------------------

\* Some theosophists, in order to make Karma more comprehensible to the
Western mind, as being better acquainted with the Greek than with Aryan
philosophy, have made an attempt to translate it by *Nemesis.* Had the
latter been known to the profane in antiquity, as it was understood by
the Initiate, this translation of the term would be unobjectionable. As
it is, it has been too much anthropomorphised by Greek fancy to permit
our using it without an elaborate explanation. With the early Greeks,
"from Homer to Herodotus, she was no goddess, but a *moral feeling*
rather," says Decharme; the barrier to evil and immorality. He who
transgresses it, commits a sacrilege in the eyes of the gods, and is
pursued by Nemesis. But, with time, that "feeling" was deified, and its
personification became an ever-fatal and punishing goddess. Therefore,
if we would connect Karma with Nemesis, it has to be done in the triple
character of the latter, viz., as Nemesis, Adrasteia and Themis. For,
while the latter is the goddess of Universal Order and Harmony, who,
like Nemesis, is commissioned to repress every excess, and keep man
within the limits of Nature and righteousness under severe penalty,
*Adrasteia --* "the inevitable" -- represents Nemesis as the immutable
effect of causes created by man himself. Nemesis, as the daughter of
*Dike,* is the equitable goddess reserving her wrath for those alone who
are maddened with pride, egoism, and impiety. (*See Mesomed. Hymn.
Nemes., V. 2. Brunck, Analecta II.* *p*. 292; *Mythol. de la Grece
Antique, p.* 304.) In short, while Nemesis is a mythological, exoteric
goddess, or Power, personified and anthropomorphised in its various
aspects, *Karma* is a highly philosophical truth, a most divine noble
expression of the primitive intuition of man concerning Deity. It is a
doctrine which explains the origin of Evil, and \[\[Footnote continued

###### \[\[Vol. 2, Page\]\] 306 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.

for Karma is one with the Unknowable, of which it is an aspect in its
effects in the phenomenal world.

Intimately, or rather indissolubly, connected with Karma, then, is the
law of re-birth, or of the re-incarnation of the same spiritual
individuality in a long, almost interminable, series of personalities.
The latter are like the various costumes and characters played by the
same actor, with each of which that actor identifies himself and is
identified by the public, for the space of a few hours. The *inner,* or
real man, who personates those characters, knows the whole time that he
is Hamlet for the brief space of a few acts, which represent, however,
on the plane of human illusion the whole life of Hamlet. And he knows
that he was, the night before, King Lear, the transformation in his turn
of the Othello of a still earlier preceding night; but the outer,
visible character is supposed to be ignorant of the fact. In actual life
that ignorance is, unfortunately, but too real. Nevertheless, the
*permanent* individuality is fully aware of the fact, though, through
the atrophy of the "spiritual" eye in the physical body, that knowledge
is unable to impress itself on the consciousness of the false
personality.

The possession of a physical *third* eye, we are told, was enjoyed by
the men of the Third Root-Race down to nearly the middle period of Third
**S**UB-race of the Fourth Root-Race, when the consolidation and
perfection of the human frame made it disappear from the outward anatomy
of man. Psychically and spiritually, however, its mental and visual
perceptions lasted till nearly the end of the Fourth Race, when its
functions, owing to the materiality and depraved condition of mankind,
died out altogether before the submersion of the bulk of the Atlantean
continent. And now we may return to the Deluges and their many "Noahs."

The student has to bear in mind that there were many such deluges as
that mentioned in Genesis, and three far more important ones, which will
be mentioned and described in the Section devoted to the subject of
pre-historic continents. To avoid erroneous conjectures, however, with
regard to the claim that the esoteric doctrine has much in it of the
legends contained in the Hindu Scriptures; that, again, the chronology
of the latter is almost that of the former -- only explained and made
clear; and that finally the belief that "Vaivasvata Manu" -- a generic
name indeed! -- was the Noah of the Aryans and his prototype, all this,
which is also the belief of the Occultists, necessitates at this
juncture a new explanation. (*Vide* Part III. "*Submerged Continents.*")
