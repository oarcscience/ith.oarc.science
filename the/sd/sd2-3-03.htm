<P>
<B>T</B>HE data derived from scientific research as to &quot;primeval
man&quot; and the ape lend no countenance to theories deriving
the former from the latter. &quot;Where, then, must we look for
primeval man?&quot; still queries Mr. Huxley, after having vainly
searched for him in the very depths of the quaternary strata.
&quot;Was the oldest <I>Homo sapiens </I>Pliocene or Miocene,
or yet more ancient? In still older strata do the fossilized bones
of <I>an ape more anthropoid,</I> or<I> a man more pithecoid </I>than
any yet known, await the researches of some unborn palaeontologist?
Time will show . . . .&quot; (&quot;Man's Place in Nature,&quot;
p. 159).
<P>
It will -- undeniably -- and thus vindicate the anthropology of
the Occultists. Meanwhile, in his eagerness to vindicate Mr. Darwin's
<I>Descent of Man, </I>Mr. Boyd Dawkins believes he has all but
found the &quot;missing link&quot; -- in theory. It was due to
theologians more than to geologists that, till nearly 1860, man
had been considered a relic no older than the Adamic orthodox
6,000 years. As Karma would have it though, it was left to a French
Abbe -- l'abbe Bourgeois -- to give this easy-going theory even
a worse blow than had been given to it by the discoveries of Boucher
de Perthes. Everyone knows that the Abbe discovered and brought
to light good evidence that man already existed during the Miocene
period; for flints of undeniably human making were excavated from
Miocene strata. In the words of the author of &quot;Modern Science
and Modern Thought&quot;: --
<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;They must either have been chipped by man, or, as Mr. Boyd
Dawkins supposes, by the Dryopithecus or some other anthropoid
ape which had a dose of intelligence so much superior to the gorilla,
or chimpanzee, as to be able to fabricate tools. But in this case
the problem would be solved and the missing link discovered, for
such an ape might well have been the <I>ancestor </I>of Palaeolithic
man.&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Or -- <I>the descendant of Eocene Man, </I>which is a variant
offered to the theory. Meanwhile, the Dryopithecus with such fine
mental endowments is yet to be discovered. On the other hand,
Neolithic and even Palaeolithic man having become an absolute
certainty, -- and, as the same author justly observes: &quot;If
100,000,000 years have elapsed since<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 676 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</H6>

<P>
the earth became sufficiently solidified to support vegetable
and animal life, the Tertiary period may have lasted for 5,000,000;
or for 10,000,000 years, if the life-sustaining order of things
has lasted, as Lyell supposes, for at least 200,000,000 years&quot;
-- why should not another theory be tried? Let us carry man, as
an hypothesis, to the close of Mesozoic times -- admitting <I>argumenti
causa </I>that the (much more recent) higher apes then existed!
This would allow ample time to man and the modern apes to have
diverged from the mythical &quot;<I>ape more anthropoid,</I>&quot;<I>
</I>and even for the latter to have degenerated into those that
are found <I>mimicking </I>man in using &quot;branches of trees
as clubs, and cracking cocoa-nuts with hammer and stones.&quot;*
Some savage tribes of hillmen in India build their abodes on trees,
just as the gorillas build their dens. The question, which of
the two, the beast or the man, has become the imitator of the
other, is scarcely an open one, even granting Mr. Boyd Dawkins'
theory. The fanciful character of his hypothesis, is, however,
generally admitted. It is argued that while in the Pliocene and
Miocene periods there were true apes and baboons, and man was
undeniably contemporaneous with the former of those times -- though
as we see orthodox anthropology still hesitates in the teeth of
facts to place him in the era of the Dryopithecus, which latter
&quot;has been considered by some anatomists as in some respects
superior to the chimpanzee or the gorilla&quot; -- yet, in the
Eocene there have been no other fossil <I>primates </I>unearthed
and no pithecoid stocks found save a few extinct lemurian forms.
And we find it also <I>hinted </I>that the Dryopithecus <I>may
have been </I>the &quot;missing link,&quot; though the brain of
the creature no more warrants the theory than does the brain of
the modern gorilla. (<I>Vide </I>also Gaudry's speculations.)
<P>
Now we would ask who among the Scientists is ready to prove that
<I>there was no man </I>in existence in the early Tertiary period?
What is it that prevented his presence? Hardly thirty years ago
his existence any farther back than 6, or 7,000 years was indignantly
denied. Now he is refused admission into the Eocene age. Next
century it may become a question whether man was not contemporary
with the &quot;flying Dragons;&quot; the pterodactyl, the plesiosaurus
and iguanodon, etc., etc. Let us listen, however, to the echo
of Science.
<H6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
</H6>

<P>
* This the way <I>primitive man </I>must have acted? We do not
know of men, not even of savages, in our age, who are known to
have imitated the apes who live side by side with them in the
forests of America and the islands. We do know of large apes who,
tamed and living in houses, will mimic men to the length of donning
hats and coats. The writer had personally a chimpanzee who, without
being taught, opened a newspaper and pretended to read in it.
It is the descending generations, the children, who mimic their
parents -- not the reverse.<HR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;Now wherever anthropoid apes lived, it is clear that, whether
as a question of anatomical structure, or of climate and surroundings,
man, or <I>some creature which was the ancestor of man, </I>might
have lived also. Anatomically speaking, apes and monkeys are as
much special variations of the mammalian type as man, whom they
resemble, bone for bone, and muscle for muscle, and the physical
animal man is simply an instance of the quadrumanous type specialised
for erect posture and a larger brain* . . . . If he could survive,
as we know he did, the adverse conditions and extreme vicissitudes
of the Glacial period, there is no reason why he might not have
lived in the semi-tropical climate of the Miocene period, when
a genial climate extended even to Greenland and Spitzbergen .

p. </I>152.)
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
While most of the men of Science, who are uncompromising in their
belief in the descent of man from an &quot;extinct anthropoid
mammal,&quot; will not accept even the bare tenability of any
other theory than an ancestor common to man and the Dryopithecus,
it is refreshing to find in a work of real scientific value such
a margin for compromise. Indeed, it is as wide as it can be made
under the circumstances, <I>i.e.</I>, without immediate danger
of getting knocked off one's feet by the tidal wave of &quot;science-adulation.&quot;
Believing that the difficulty of accounting &quot;for the development
of <I>intellect </I>and<I> morality </I>by evolution is <I>not
so great as that presented by the difference as to physical structure**
</I>between man and the highest animal,&quot; the same author
says: --
<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;But it is not so easy to see how this difference of physical
structure arose, and how a being came into existence which had
such a brain and hand, and such undeveloped capabilities for an
almost unlimited progress. The difficulty is this: the difference
in structure between the lowest existing race of man and the highest
existing ape is too great to admit of the possibility of one being
the direct descendant of the other. The negro in some respects
makes a slight approximation towards the Simian type. His skull
is narrower, his brain less capacious, his muzzle more projecting,
his arm longer than those of the

* It is asked, whether it would change one iota of the scientific
truth and fact contained in the above sentence if it were to read:
&quot;the ape is simply an instance of the biped type specialized
for going on all fours, generally, and a smaller brain.&quot;
<I>Esoterically </I>speaking, this is the real truth, and not
the reverse.
<P>
** We cannot follow Mr. Laing here. When avowed Darwinists like
Huxley point to &quot;the <I>great gulf </I>which intervenes between
the lowest ape and the highest man in <I>intellectual </I>power,&quot;
the &quot;<I>enormous gulf </I>. . . between them,&quot; the &quot;<I>immeasurable
and practically infinite </I>divergence of the Human from the
Simian stirps&quot; (<I>Man</I>'<I>s Place in Nature, </I>pp.
102-3); when even the physical basis of mind -- the brain -- so<I>
vastly </I>exceeds in size that of the highest existing apes;
when men like Wallace are forced to invoke the agency of extra-terrestrial
intelligences in order to explain the rise of such a creature
as the Pithecanthropus alalus, or speechless savage of Haeckel,
to the level of the large-brained and <I>moral</I> man of to-day
-- it is idle to dismiss Evolutionist puzzles so lightly. If the
<I>structural </I>evidence is so unconvincing and, taken as a
whole, so hostile to Darwinism, the difficulties as to the &quot;how&quot;
of the Evolution of the human <I>mind </I>by natural selection
are tenfold greater.<HR>

average European man. Still he is essentially a man, and separated
by a wide gulf from the chimpanzee or the gorilla. <I>Even the
idiot or cretin, </I>whose brain is no larger and intelligence
no greater than that of the chimpanzee, is <I>an arrested man,
not an ape.</I>&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;If, therefore, the Darwinian theory holds good in the case
of man and ape, we must go back to some common ancestor from whom
both may have originated . . . . But to establish this as a <I>fact
</I>and not a <I>theory </I>we require to find that ancestral
form, or, at any rate, some intermediate forms tending towards
it . . . . in other words . . . . the missing link! Now it must
be admitted that, hitherto, not only have no such missing links
been discovered, but the oldest known human sculls and skeletons
which date from the Glacial period, and are probably at least
100,000 years old, show no very decided approximation towards
any such pre-human type. On the contrary, <I>one of the oldest
types, </I>that of the men of the sepulchral cave of Cro-Magnon,*
<I>is that of a fine race, tall in stature, large in brain, and</I>
<I>on the whole superior to many of the existing races of mankind.
</I>The reply of course is that the time is insufficient, <I>and
if man and the ape had a common ancestor, </I>that as a highly
developed anthropoid ape, certainly, and man, probably, already
existed in the Miocene period, such ancestor must be sought still
further back at a distance compared with which the whole Quaternary
period sinks into insignificance . . . . It may well make us hesitate
before we admit that man . . . is alone an exception. . . . This
is more difficult to believe, as the ape family which man (?)
so closely resembles . . . . contains numerous branches which
graduate into one another, but the extremes of which differ more
widely than man does from the highest of the ape series. If a
special creation is required for man, <I>must there not have been
special creations for the chimpanzee, the gorilla, the orang,
</I>and for at least 100 different species of ape and monkeys
which are all built on the same lines?&quot; (p. 182, &quot;Modern
Science, etc.&quot;)
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
There <I>was </I>a &quot;special creation&quot; for man, and a
&quot;special creation&quot; for the ape,<I> his </I>progeny;
only on other lines than ever bargained for by Science. Albert
Gaudry and others give some weighty reasons why man cannot be
regarded as the crown of an ape-stock. When one finds that not
only was the &quot;primeval savage&quot; (?) a reality in the
Miocene times, but that, as de Mortillet shows, the flint relics
he has left behind him were splintered <I>by</I> <I>fire </I>in
that remote epoch; when we learn that the Dryopithecus, <I>alone
of the anthropoids, </I>appears in those strata, what is the natural
inference? That the Darwinians are in a quandary. The very manlike
Gibbon is <I>still in the same low grade of development, as it
was when it co-existed with Man at the close of the Glacial Period.
</I>It has not appreciably altered since the Pliocene times. Now
there is little to choose between the Dryopithecus and the existing
anthropoids -- gibbon, gorilla, etc. If, then, the Darwinian theory
is all-sufficient, how are we to &quot;explain&quot; the evolution
of this

<P>
ape into Man during the first half of the Miocene? The time is
far too short for such a theoretical transformation. The extreme
slowness with which variation in species supervenes renders the
thing inconceivable -- more especially on the Natural Selection
hypothesis. The enormous mental and structural gulf between a
savage acquainted with fire and the mode of kindling it, and a
brutal anthropoid, is too much to bridge even in idea, during
so contracted a period. Let the Evolutionists push back the process
into the preceding <I>Eocene, </I>if they prefer to do so; let
them even trace both Man and Dryopithecus to a common ancestor;
the unpleasant consideration has, nevertheless, to be faced that
in Eocene strata the anthropoid fossils are as conspicuous by
their absence, as is the fabulous <I>pithecanthropus </I>of Haeckel.
Is an exit out of this <I>cul de sac </I>to be found by an appeal
to the &quot;unknown,&quot; and a reference with Darwin to the
&quot;imperfection of the geological record&quot;? So be it; but
the same right of appeal must be accorded equally to the Occultists,
instead of remaining the monopoly of puzzled materialism. Physical
man, we say, existed before the first bed of the Cretaceous rocks
was deposited. In the early part of the Tertiary Age, the most
brilliant civilization the world has ever known flourished at
a period when the Haeckelian <I>man-ape</I> is conceived to have
roamed through the primeval forests, and Mr. Grant Allen's putative
ancestor to have swung himself from bough to bough with his hairy
mates, the degenerated Liliths of the Third Race Adam. Yet there
were no anthropoid apes in the brighter days of the civilization
of the Fourth Race; but Karma is a mysterious law, and no respecter
of persons. The monsters bred in sin and shame by the Atlantean
giants, &quot;<I>blurred copies</I>&quot;<I> </I>of their bestial
sires, and hence of modern man (Huxley), now mislead and overwhelm
with error the speculative Anthropologist of European Science.
<P>
Where did the first men live? Some Darwinists say in Western Africa,
some in Southern Asia, others, again, believe in an independent
origin of human stocks in Asia and America from a Simian ancestry
(Vogt). Haeckel, however, advances gaily to the charge. Starting
from his &quot;prosimiae&quot; . . . &quot;the ancestor common
to all other catarrhini, including man&quot; -- a &quot;link&quot;
now, however, disposed of for good by recent anatomical discoveries!
-- he endeavours to find a habitat for the primeval Pithecanthropus
alalus. &quot;In all probability it (the transformation of animal
into man) occurred in Southern Asia, in which region many evidences
are forthcoming that here was the original home of the different
species of men. Probably Southern Asia itself was not the earliest
cradle of the human race, but <STRONG>L</STRONG>EMURIA, <I>a continent
that lay to the south of Asia, and sank later on beneath the surface
of the Indian Ocean. </I>(<I>Vide infra, </I>&quot;Scientific
and geological proofs of the former existence of several<HR>

submerged continents.&quot;) &quot;The period during which the
evolution of the anthropoid apes into apelike men took place was
probably the last part of the tertiary period, the Pliocene Age,
and perhaps the Miocene, its forerunner.&quot; (Pedigree of Man,
p. 73.)
<P>
Of the above speculations, the only one of any worth is that referring
to Lemuria, which <I>was </I>the cradle of mankind -- of the physical
sexual creature who materialized through long aeons out of the
ethereal hermaphrodites. Only, if it is proved that <I>Easter
Island </I>is an actual relic of Lemuria, we must believe that
according to Haeckel the &quot;<I>dumb ape-men</I>,&quot; just
removed from a brutal mammalian monster, built the gigantic portrait-statues,
some of which are now in the British Museum. Critics are mistaken
in terming Haeckelian doctrines &quot;abominable, revolutionary,
immoral&quot; -- though materialism is the legitimate outcome
of the ape-ancestor myth -- they are simply too absurd to demand
disproof.

<P>
We are told that while every other heresy against modern science
may be disregarded, this, our denial of the Darwinian theory as
applied to Man, will be the one &quot;unpardonable&quot; sin.
The Evolutionists stand firm as rock on the evidence of similarity
of structure between the ape and the man. The anatomical evidence,
it is urged, is quite overpowering in this case; it is <I>bone
for bone,</I> and<I> muscle for muscle, </I>even the brain conformation
being very much the same.
<P>
Well, what of that? All this was known before King Herod; and
the writers of the <I>Ramayana, </I>the poets who sang the prowess
and valour of Hanuman, the monkey-God, &quot;whose feats were
great and Wisdom never rivalled,&quot; must have known as much
about his anatomy and brain as does any Haeckel or Huxley in our
modern day. Volumes upon volumes were written upon this similarity,
in antiquity as in more modern times. Therefore, there is nothing
new whatever given to the world or to philosophy, in such volumes
as Mivart's &quot;Man and Apes,&quot; or Messrs. Fiske and Huxley's
defence of Darwinism. But what are those <I>crucial </I>proofs
of man's descent from a pithecoid ancestor? If the Darwinian theory
<I>is not the true one -- </I>we are told -- if man and ape do
not descend from a common ancestor, then we are called upon to
explain the reason of: --
<P>
(I.) The similarity of structure between the two; the fact that
the<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page 681]] HUXLEY CALLS THE DARWINISTS TO ORDER.
</H6>

<P>
higher animal world -- man and beast -- is physically of one type
or pattern.
<P>
(II.) The presence of <I>rudimentary organs </I>in man, <I>i.e.</I>,
traces of former organs now atrophied by disuse. Some of these
organs, it is asserted, could not have had any scope for employment,
except for a semi-animal, semi-arboreal monster. Why, again, do
we find in Man those &quot;rudimentary&quot; organs (as useless
as its rudimentary wing is to the<I> Apteryx </I>of Australia),
the vermiform appendix of the <I>coecum, </I>the ear muscles,*
the &quot;rudimentary tail&quot; (with which children are still
sometimes born), etc., etc.?
<P>
Such is the war cry; and the cackle of the smaller fry among the
Darwinians is louder, if possible, than even that of the scientific
Evolutionists themselves!
<P>
Furthermore, the latter themselves -- with their great leader
Mr. Huxley, and such eminent zoologists as Mr. Romanes and others
-- while defending the Darwinian theory, are the first to confess
the almost insuperable difficulties in the way of its final demonstration.
And there are as great men of science as the above-named, who
deny, most emphatically, the uncalled-for assumption, and loudly
denounce the unwarrantable exaggerations on the question of this
supposed similarity. It is sufficient to glance at the works of
Broca, Gratiolet, of Owen, Pruner-Bey, and finally, at the last
great work of de Quatrefages, &quot;<I>Introduction a l</I>'<I>Etude
des Races humaines, Questions generales,</I>&quot; to<I> </I>discover
the fallacy of the Evolutionists. We may say more: the exaggerations
concerning such similarity of structure between man and the anthropomorphous
ape have become so glaring and absurd of late, that even Mr. Huxley
found himself forced to protest against the too sanguine expectations.
It was that great anatomist personally who called the &quot;smaller
fry&quot; to order, by declaring in one of his articles that the
differences in the structure of the human body and that of the
highest anthropomorphous pithecoid, were not only <I>far from
being trifling and unimportant, </I>but were, on the contrary,
very great and suggestive: &quot;each of the bones of the gorilla
has its own specific impress on it that distinguishes it from
a similar human bone.&quot; Among the existing creatures there
is not one single intermediate form that could fill the gap between
man and the ape. To ignore that gap, he added, &quot;was <I>as
uncalled-for as it was absurd.</I>&quot;<I>**</I> 
<H6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
</H6>

<P>
* Professor Owen believes that these muscles -- the attollens,
retrahens, and attrahens aurem -- were actively functioning in
men of the Stone Age. This may or may not be the case. The question
falls under the ordinary &quot;occult&quot; explanation, and involves
no postulate of an &quot;animal progenitor&quot; to solve it.
<P>
** Quoted in the Review of the &quot;<I>Introduction a l</I>'<I>Etude
des Races Humaines,</I>&quot;<I> by de Quatrefages. </I>We have
not Mr. Huxley's work at hand to quote from. Or to cite another
good authority: -- &quot;We find one of the most man-like apes
(gibbon), in the [[Footnote continued on next page]]<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 682 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</H6>

<P>
Finally, the absurdity of such an <I>unnatural </I>descent of
man is so palpable in the face of all the proofs and evidence
of the skull of the pithecoid as compared to that of man, that
even de Quatrefages resorted unconsciously to our esoteric theory
by saying <I>that it is rather the apes that can claim descent
from man </I>than <I>vice versa. </I>As proven by Gratiolet, with
regard to the cavities of the brain of the anthropoids, in which
species that organ develops in an inverse ratio to what would
be the case were the corresponding organs in man really the product
of the development of the said organs in the apes -- the size
of the human skull and its brain, as well as the cavities, increase
with the individual development of man. His intellect develops
and increases with age, while his facial bones and jaws diminish
and straighten, thus being more and more spiritualized: whereas
with the ape it is the reverse. In its youth the anthropoid is
far more intelligent and good-natured, while with age it becomes
duller; and, as its skull recedes and seems to diminish as it
grows, its facial bones and jaws develop, the brain being finally
crushed, and thrown entirely back, to make with every day more
room for the animal type. The organ of thought -- the brain --
recedes and diminishes, entirely conquered and replaced by that
of the wild beast -- the jaw apparatus.
<P>
Thus, as wittily remarked in the French work, a gorilla would
have a perfect right to address an Evolutionist, claiming its
right of descent from himself. It would say to him, &quot;We,
anthropoid apes, form a retrogressive departure from the human
type, and therefore our development and evolution are expressed
by a transition from a human-like to an animal-like structure
of organism; but in what way could <I>you, </I>men, descend from
us -- how can you form a continuation of our genus? For, to make
this possible, your organization would have to differ still more
than ours does from the human structure, it would have to approach
still closer to that of the beast than ours does; and in such
a case justice demands that you should give up to us your place
in nature. You are lower than we are, once that you insist on
tracing your genealogy from our kind; for the structure of our
organization and its development are such that we are unable to
generate forms of a higher organization than our own.&quot;

contradict a theory of constant progressive development.&quot;
(Pfaff.) When, according to Vogt, the the average Australian brain

<P>
fages. Owing to the very type of his development man <I>cannot
descend </I>from either an ape or an ancestor common to both,
but shows his origin from a type far superior to himself. And
this type is the &quot;Heavenly man&quot; -- the Dhyan Chohans,
or the <I>Pitris </I>so-called, as shown in the first Part of
this volume. On the other hand, the pithecoids, the orang-outang,
the gorilla, and the chimpanzee <I>can</I>, and, as the Occult
Sciences teach, <I>do, </I>descend from the animalized Fourth
human Root-Race, being the product of man and an extinct species
of mammal -- whose <I>remote </I>ancestors were themselves the
product of Lemurian bestiality -- which lived in the Miocene age.
The ancestry of this semi-human monster is explained in the Stanzas
as originating in the sin of the &quot;Mind-less&quot; races of
the middle Third Race period.
<P>
When it is borne in mind that all forms which now people the earth,
are so many variations on <I>basic types </I>originally thrown
off by the <B>M</B>AN of the Third and Fourth Round, such an evolutionist
argument as that insisting on the &quot;unity of structural plan&quot;
characterising all vertebrates, loses its edge. The basic types
referred to were very few in number in comparison with the multitude
of organisms to which they ultimately gave rise; but a general
unity of type has, nevertheless, been preserved throughout the
ages. The economy of Nature does not sanction the co-existence
of several utterly opposed &quot;ground plans&quot; of organic
evolution on one planet. Once, however, that the general drift
of the occult explanation is formulated, inference as to detail
may well be left to the intuitive reader.
<P>
Similarly with the important question of the &quot;rudimentary&quot;
organs discovered by anatomists in the human organism. Doubtless
this line of argument, when wielded by Darwin and Haeckel against
their European adversaries, proved of great weight. Anthropologists,
who ventured to dispute the derivation of man from an animal ancestry,
were sorely puzzled how to deal with the presence of gill-clefts,
with the &quot;tail&quot; problem, and so on. Here again Occultism
comes to our assistance with the necessary data.

The fact is that, as previously stated, the human type is the
repertory of all potential organic forms, and the central point
from which these latter radiate. In this postulate we find a true
&quot;<I>Evolution</I>&quot;<I> </I>or<I> </I>&quot;<I>Unfolding</I>&quot;<I>
-- </I>a sense which cannot be said to belong to the mechanical
theory of natural selection. Criticising Darwin's inference from
&quot;rudiments,&quot; an able writer remarks: &quot;Why is it
not just as probably a true hypothesis to suppose that Man was
<I>created with the rudimentary sketches in his organization,
and that they became useful appendages in the lower animals into
which man degenerated, </I>as to suppose that these parts existed
in full development in the lower animals out of which man was
generated?&quot; (&quot;Creation or Evolution?&quot; Geo. T. Curtis,
p. 76.)<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 684 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</H6>

<P>
Read for &quot;into which Man degenerated,&quot; &quot;the prototypes
which man <I>shed </I>in the course of his astral developments,&quot;
and an aspect of the true esoteric solution is before us. But
a wider generalization is now to be formulated.
<P>
So far as our present <I>Fourth Round </I>terrestrial period is
concerned, the mammalian fauna are alone to be regarded as traceable
to prototypes shed by Man. The amphibia, birds, reptiles, fishes,
etc., are the resultants of the Third Round, astral fossil forms
stored up in the auric envelope of the Earth and projected into
physical objectivity subsequent to the deposition of the first
Laurentian rocks. &quot;Evolution&quot; has to deal with the progressive
modifications, which palaeontology shows to have affected the
lower animal and vegetable kingdoms in the course of geological
time. It does not, and from the nature of things cannot, touch
on the subject of the pre-physical types which served as the basis
for future differentiation. Tabulate the general laws controlling
the development of physical organisms it certainly may, and to
a certain extent it has acquitted itself ably of the task.
<P>
To return to the immediate subject of discussion. The mammalia,
whose first traces are discovered in the marsupials of the Triassic
rocks of the Secondary Period, were evolved from <I>purely</I>
astral progenitors contemporary with the Second Race. They are
thus <I>post-Human, </I>and, consequently, it is easy to account
for the general resemblance between their embryonic stages and
those of Man, who necessarily embraces in himself and epitomizes
in his development the features of the group he originated. This
explanation disposes of a portion of the Darwinist brief. &quot;But
how to account for the presence of the gill-clefts in the human
foetus, which represent the stage through which the branchiae
of the fish are developed;* for the pulsating vessel corresponding
to the heart of the lower fishes, which constitutes the foetal
heart; for the entire analogy presented by the segmentation of
the human ovum, the formation of the blastoderm, and the appearance
of the 'gastrula' stage, with corresponding stages in lower vertebrate
life and even among the sponges; for the various types of lower
animal life which the form of the future child shadows forth in
the cycle of its growth?&quot; &quot;How comes it to pass that
stages in the life of fishes, whose ancestors swam&quot; -- aeons
before the epoch of the First Root-Race,
<H6>[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
</H6>

<P>
* &quot;At this period,&quot; writes Darwin, &quot;the arteries
run in arch-like branches, as if to carry the blood to branchiae
which are not present in the higher vertebrata, though the slits
on the side of the neck still remain, marking their former (?)
position.&quot;
<P>
It is noteworthy that, though gill-clefts are absolutely useless
to all but amphibia and fishes, etc., their appearance is regularly
noted in the foetal development of vertebrates. Even children
are occasionally born with an opening in the neck corresponding
to one of the clefts.<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 685 REVERSION FROM THE WRONG END.</H6>

<P>
-- &quot;in the seas of the Silurian period, as well as stages
in that of the later amphibian, reptilian fauna, are mirrored
in the 'epitomized history' of human foetal development?&quot;
<P>
This plausible objection is met by the reply that the <I>Third
Round </I>terrestrial animal forms were just as much referable
to types thrown off by Third Round man, as that new importation
into our planet's area -- the mammalian stock -- is to the Fourth
Round Humanity of the Second Root-race. The process of human foetal
growth epitomizes not only the general characteristics of the
Fourth, but of the Third Round terrestrial life. The diapason
of type is run through in brief. Occultists are thus at no loss
to &quot;account for&quot; the birth of children with an actual
caudal appendage, or for the fact that the tail in the human foetus
is, at one period, double the length of the nascent legs. The
potentiality of every organ useful to animal life is locked up
in Man -- the microcosm of the Macrocosm -- and abnormal conditions
may not unfrequently result in the strange phenomena which Darwinists
regard as &quot;reversion to ancestral features.&quot;* Reversion,
indeed, but scarcely in the sense contemplated by our present-day
empiricists!

<P>
The public has been notified by more than one eminent modern geologist
and man of science, that &quot;all estimate of geological duration
is not merely <I>impossible, </I>but necessarily imperfect; for
we are ignorant of the causes, though they must have existed,
which quickened or retarded the progress of the sedimentary deposits.&quot;**
And now another man of Science, as well known (Croll), calculating
that the tertiary age began either 15 or 2 1/2 million of years
ago -- the former being a more correct calculation, according
to Esoteric doctrine, than the latter there -- seems in this case,
at least, no very great disagreement. Exact Science, refusing
to see in man &quot;a special creation&quot; (to a certain degree
the Secret Sciences do the same), is at liberty to ignore the
first three, or rather two-and-a-half Races -- <I>the Spiritual,
the semi-astral, and the</I>

his 22 stages through which the monera have passed in their ascent

<I>semi-human -</I>- of our teachings. But it can hardly do the
same in the case of the Third at its closing period, the Fourth,
and the Fifth Races, since it already divides mankind into Palaeolithic
and Neolithic man.* The geologists of France place man in the
mid-miocene age (Gabriel de Mortillet), and some even in the <I>Secondary
</I>period, as de Quatrefages suggests; while the English <I>savants
</I>do not generally accept such antiquity for their species.
But they may know better some day. For &quot;If we consider,&quot;
says Sir Charles Lyell in &quot;Antiquity of Man,&quot; p. 246
--
<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;the absence or extreme scarcity of human bones and works
of art in all strata, whether marine or fresh water, even in those
formed in the immediate proximity of land inhabited by millions
of human beings, we shall be prepared for the general dearth of
human memorials in glacial formations, whether recent, Pleistocene,
or of more ancient date. If there were a few wanderers over lands
covered with glaciers, or over seas infested with icebergs, and
if a few of them left their bones or weapons in moraines or in
marine drifts, the chances, after the lapse of thousands of years,
of a geologist meeting with one of them must be infinitesimally
small.&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
The men of Science avoid pinning themselves down to any definite
statement concerning the age of man, as indeed they hardly could,
and thus leave enormous latitude to bolder speculations. Nevertheless,
while the majority of the Anthropologists carry back the existence
of man <I>only </I>into the period of the <I>post</I>-glacial
drift, or what is called the Quaternary period, those of them
who, as <I>Evolutionists, trace man to a common origin with that
of the monkey, </I>do not show great consistency in their speculations.
The Darwinian hypothesis demands, in reality, a far greater antiquity
for man, than is even dimly suspected by superficial thinkers.
This is proven by the greatest authorities on the question --
Mr. Huxley, for instance. Those, therefore, who accept the Darwinian
evolution, <I>ipso facto </I>hold very tenaciously to an antiquity
<H6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
</H6>

<P>
* We confess to not being able to see any good reasons for Mr.
E. Clodd's certain statement in <I>Knowledge. </I>Speaking of
the men of Neolithic times, &quot;concerning whom Mr. Grant Allen
has given . . . a vivid and accurate sketch,&quot; and who are
&quot;the direct ancestors of peoples of whom remnants yet lurk
in out-of-the-way corners of Europe, where they have been squeezed
or stranded,&quot; he adds to this: &quot;but the men of Palaeolithic
times can be identified with no existing races; they were savages
of a more degraded type than any extant; tall, yet barely erect,
with short legs and twisted knees, with prognathous, that is,
projecting ape-like jaws, and small brains. Whence they come we
cannot tell, and their 'grave knoweth no man to this day.' &quot;
<P>
Besides the possibility that there may be men who <I>know</I>
whence they came and how they perished -- it is not true to say
that the Palaeolithic men, or their fossils, are all found with
&quot;small brains.&quot; The oldest skull of all those hitherto
found, the &quot;Neanderthal skull,&quot; is of average capacity,
and Mr. Huxley was compelled to confess that it was no real approximation
whatever to that of the &quot;missing link.&quot; There are aboriginal
tribes in India whose brains are far smaller and nearer to that
of the ape than any hitherto found among the skulls of Palaeolithic
man.<HR>

<P>
of man so very great, indeed, that it falls not so far short of
the Occultist's estimate.* The modest thousands of years of the
<I>Encyclopaedia Britannica </I>and the 100,000 years, to which
Anthropology in general limits the age of Humanity, seem quite
microscopical when compared with the figures implied in Mr. Huxley's
bold speculations. The former, indeed, makes of the original race
of men ape-like cave-dwellers. The great English biologist, in
his desire to prove man's pithecoid origin, insists that the transformation
of the primordial ape into a human being must have occurred <I>millions
of years back. </I>For in criticising the excellent average cranial
capacity of the Neanderthal skull, notwithstanding his assertion
that it is overlaid with &quot;pithecoid bony walls,&quot; coupled
with Mr. Grant Allen's assurances that this skull &quot;possesses
large bosses on the forehead, strikingly (?) suggestive of those
which give the gorilla its peculiarly fierce appearance,&quot;**
(<I>Fortnightly Review, </I>1882,) still Mr. Huxley is forced
to admit that, in the said skull, his theory is once more defeated
by the &quot;completely human proportions of the accompanying
limb-bones, together with the fair development of the Engis skull.&quot;
In consequence of all this we are notified that those skulls,
&quot;clearly indicate that the first traces of the primordial
stock whence man has proceeded, need no longer be sought by those
who entertain any form of the doctrine of progressive development
in the newest Tertiaries; but that they <I>may be looked for in
an epoch more distant from the age of the </I>ELEPHAS PRIMIGENIUS
<I>than that is from us</I>&quot;<I>*** </I>(Huxley).
<H6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
</H6>

<P>
* The <I>actual</I> time required for such a theoretical transformation
is necessarily enormous. &quot;If,&quot; says Professor Pfaff,
&quot;in the hundreds of thousands of years which you (the Evolutionists)
accept between the rise of palaeolithic man and our own day, a
greater distance of man from the brute is not demonstrable, (<I>the
most ancient man was just as far removed from the brute as the
now living man</I>), what reasonable ground can be advanced for
believing that man has been developed from the brute, and has
receded further from it by infinitely small gradations.&quot;
. . . . &quot;<I>The longer the interval of time placed between
our times and the so-called palaeolithic men, the more ominous
and destructive for the theory of the gradual development of man
from the animal kingdom is the result stated.</I>&quot;<I> </I>Huxley
states (&quot;Man's Place in Nature,&quot; p. 159) that the <I>most
liberal</I> estimates for the antiquity of Man <I>must be still
further </I>extended.
<P>
** The baselessness of this assertion, as well as that of many
other exaggerations of the imaginative Mr. Grant Allen, was ably
exposed by the eminent anatomist, Professor R. Owen, in &quot;Longman's
Magazine,&quot; No. 1. Must it be repeated, moreover, that the
Cro-Magnon Palaeolithic type is superior to a very large number
of existing races?
<P>
*** It thus stands to reason that science would never dream of
a <I>pre</I>-tertiary man, and that de Quatrefages' <I>secondary</I>
man makes every Academician and &quot;<STRONG>F.R.S</STRONG>.&quot;
faint with horror because, TO PRESERVE THE APE-THEORY, SCIENCE
MUST MAKE MAN POST-SECONDARY. This is just what de Quatrefages
has twitted the Darwinists with, adding, that on the whole there
were more scientific reasons to trace the ape from man than man
from the anthropoid. With this exception science has not one single
valid argu- [[Footnote continued on next page]]<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 688 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</H6>

<P>
An <I>untold </I>antiquity for man is thus, then, the scientific
<I>sine qua non </I>in the question of Darwinian Evolution, since
the oldest Palaeolithic man shows as yet no appreciable differentiation
from his modern descendant. It is only of late that modern Science
began to widen with every year the abyss that now separates her
from old Science, that of the Plinies and Hippocrateses, none
of whom would have derided the archaic teachings with respect
to the evolution of the human races and animal species, as the
present day Scientist -- geologist or anthropologist -- is sure
to do.
<P>
Holding, as we do, that the mammalian type was a post-human Fourth
Round product, the following diagram -- as the writer understands
the teaching -- may make the process clear: --

<P>
[[Footnote continued from previous page]] ment to offer against
the antiquity of man. But in this case modern Evolution demands
far more than the fifteen million years of Croll for the Tertiary
period, for two very simple but good reasons: (<I>a</I>) No anthropoid
ape has been found before the Miocene period: (<I>b</I>) man's
flint relics have been traced to the Pliocene and their presence
<I>suspected, </I>if not accepted by all, in the Miocene strata.
Again, where is the &quot;missing link&quot; in such case? And
how could even a Palaeolithic Savage, a &quot;Man of Canstadt,&quot;
evolve into <I>thinking</I> men from the brute Dryopithecus of
the Miocene <I>in</I> <I>so short a time. </I>One sees now the
reason why Darwin rejected the theory that only 60,000,000 years
had elapsed since the Cambrian period. &quot;He judges from the
small amount of organic changes since the glacial epoch, and adds
that the previous 140 million years can hardly be considered as
sufficient for the development of the varied forms of life which
certainly existed toward the close of the Cambrian period.&quot;
(Ch. Gould.)
<P>
* Let us remember in this connection the esoteric teaching which
tells us of Man having had in the Third Round a GIGANTIC APE-LIKE
FORM on the astral plane. And similarly at the close of the Third
Race in this Round. Thus it accounts for the <I>human</I> features
of the apes, especially of the later anthropoids -- apart from
the fact that these latter preserve by <I>Heredity </I>a resemblance
to their Atlanto-Lemurian sires.<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 689 THE INCUBUS OF ETHNOLOGY.</H6>

<P>
Man -- to develop the necessary barrier. Medical science records
such cases of monsters, bred from human and animal parents, even
in our own day. The possibility is, therefore, only one of <I>degree,
</I>not of fact. Thus it is that Occultism solves one of the strangest
problems presented to the consideration of the anthropologist.
<P>
The pendulum of thought oscillates between extremes. Having now
finally emancipated herself from the shackles of theology, Science
has embraced the opposite fallacy; and in the attempt to interpret
Nature on purely materialistic lines, she has built up that most
extravagant theory of the ages -- the derivation of man from a
ferocious and brutal ape. So rooted has this doctrine, in one
form or another, now become, that the most Herculean efforts will
be needed to bring about its final rejection. The Darwinian anthropology
is the incubus of the ethnologist, a sturdy child of modem Materialism,
which has grown up and acquired increasing vigour, as the ineptitude
of the theological legend of Man's &quot;creation&quot; became
more and more apparent. It has thriven on account of the strange
delusion that -- as a scientist of repute puts it -- &quot;All
hypotheses and theories with respect to the rise of man can be
reduced to <I>two </I>(the Evolutionist and the Biblical exoteric
account) . . . There is no other hypothesis conceivable . . .
&quot; !! The anthropology of the secret volumes is, however,
the best possible answer to such a worthless contention.
<P>
The anatomical resemblance between Man and the higher Ape, so
frequently cited by Darwinists as pointing to some former ancestor
common to both, presents an interesting problem, the proper solution
of which is to be sought for in the esoteric explanation of the
genesis of the pithecoid stocks. We have given it as far as was
useful, by stating that the bestiality of the primeval mindless
races resulted in the production of huge man-like monsters --
the offspring of human and animal parents. As time rolled on,
and the still semi-astral forms consolidated into the physical,
the descendants of these creatures were modified by external conditions,
until the breed, dwindling in size, culminated in the lower apes
of the Miocene period. With these the later Atlanteans renewed
the sin of the &quot;Mindless&quot; -- this time with full responsibility.
The resultants of their crime were the species of apes now known
as Anthropoid.
<P>
It may be useful to compare this very simple theory -- and we
are willing to offer it even as a hypothesis to the unbelievers
-- with the Darwinian scheme, so full of insurmountable obstacles,
that no sooner is one of these overcome by a more or less ingenious
hypothesis, than ten worse difficulties are forthwith discovered
behind the one disposed of.
