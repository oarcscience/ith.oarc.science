. . . .
<P>
(<EM>a</EM>)<EM> </EM>This verse (47) relates to the Fifth Race.
History does not begin with it, but living and ever-recurring
tradition does. History -- or what is called history -- does not
go further back than the fantastic origins of our fifth sub-race,
a &quot;few thousands&quot; of years. It is the sub-divisions
of this first sub-race of the Fifth Root-Race which are referred
to in the sentence, &quot;Some yellow, some brown and black, and
some red, remained.&quot; The &quot;moon coloured&quot; (<EM>i.e</EM>.,
the First and the Second Races) were gone for ever -- ay, without
leaving any traces whatever; and that, so far back as the third
&quot;Deluge&quot; of the Third Lemurian race, that &quot;Great
Dragon,&quot; whose tail sweeps whole nations out of existence
in the twinkling of an eye. And this is the true meaning of the
Verse in the <STRONG>C</STRONG>OMMENTARY which says:
<P>
&quot;<EM>The</EM> <STRONG>G</STRONG>REAT <STRONG>D</STRONG>RAGON
<EM>has respect but for the </EM>'<STRONG>S</STRONG>ERPENTS' <EM>of</EM>
<STRONG>W</STRONG>ISDOM, <EM>the Serpents whose holes are now
under the triangular stones,</EM>&quot;<EM> i.e., </EM>&quot;the
Pyramids, at the four corners of the world.&quot;
<P>
(<EM>b</EM>) This tells us clearly that which is mentioned more
than once elsewhere in the Commentaries; namely, that the Adepts
or &quot;Wise&quot; men of the three Races (the Third, Fourth
and the Fifth) dwelt in subterranean habitats, generally under
some kind of pyramidal structure, if not<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 352 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</H6>

<P>
actually under a pyramid. For such &quot;pyramids&quot; existed
in the four corners of the world and were never the monopoly of
the land of the Pharaohs, though until found scattered all over
the two Americas, under and over ground, beneath and amidst virgin
forests, as in plain and vale, they were supposed to be the exclusive
property of Egypt. If the true geometrically correct pyramids
are no longer found in European regions, many of the supposed
early <EM>neolithic </EM>caves, of the colossal triangular, pyramidal
and conical <EM>menhirs </EM>in the Morbihan, and Brittany generally;
many of the Danish tumuli and even of the &quot;giant tombs&quot;
of Sardinia with their inseparable companions, the <EM>nuraghi,
</EM>are so many more or less clumsy copies of the pyramids. Most
of these are the works of the first settlers on the newly-born
continent and isles of Europe, the -- &quot;some yellow, some
brown and black, and some red&quot; -- races that remained after
the submersion of the last Atlantean continents and islands (850,000
years ago), with the exception of Plato's Atlantean island, and
before the arrival of the great Aryan races; while others were
built by the earliest immigrants from the East. Those who can
hardly accept the antiquity of the human race so far back as the
57,000 years assigned by Dr. Dowler to the skeleton found by him
at New Orleans on the banks of the Mississippi, will, of course,
reject these facts. But they may find themselves mistaken some
day. It is the foolish self-glorification of the Arcadians who
styled themselves [[<EM>proselenoi</EM>]] -- older than the moon
-- and of the people of Attica, who claimed that they had existed
before the sun appeared in heaven, that we may disparage, not
their undeniable antiquity. Nor can we laugh at the universal
belief that we had giant ancestors. The fact that the bones of
the mammoth and mastodon, and, in one case, those of a gigantic
salamander, have been mistaken for human bones, does not make
away with the difficulty that, of all the mammalians, man is the
only one whom science will not allow to have dwarfed down, like
all other animal frames, from the giant <EM>homo</EM> <EM>diluvii
</EM>to the creature between 5 and 6 feet that he is now.
<P>
But the &quot;Serpents of Wisdom&quot; have preserved their records
well, and the history of the human evolution is traced in heaven
as it is traced on underground walls. Humanity and the <EM>stars
</EM>are bound together indissolubly, because of the <EM>intelligences
</EM>that rule the latter.
<P>
Modern symbologists may scoff at this and call it &quot;fancy,&quot;
but &quot;it is unquestionable that the Deluge has (ever) been
associated in the legends of some Eastern peoples not only with
the Pyramids, but also with the constellations,&quot; writes Mr.
Staniland Wake <B>(</B>&quot;<EM>The Great</EM> <EM>Pyramid</EM>&quot;).<EM>
</EM>The &quot;Old Dragon&quot; is identical with the &quot;great
Flood,&quot; says Mr. Proctor (<EM>in </EM>&quot;<EM>Knowledge,</EM>&quot;<EM>
Vol. I., p. </EM>243): &quot;We know that in the past the constellation
of the Dragon was at the pole, or boss, of the celestial sphere.
In stellar temples . . . the Dragon would be the<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 353 THE ASTRONOMICAL DRAGON. </H6>

<P>
uppermost or ruling constellation . . . it is singular how closely
the constellations . . . correspond in sequence and in range of
right ascension with the events recorded respecting the (Biblical)
Flood.&quot;
<P>
The reasons for this <EM>singularity </EM>have been made clear
in this work. But it shows only that there were <EM>several </EM>Deluges
mixed up in the memories and traditions of the sub-races of the
Fifth Race. The first great &quot;Flood&quot; was astronomical
and cosmical, while several others were <EM>terrestrial. </EM>Yet,
this did not prevent our very learned friend Mr. Gerald Massey
-- an <EM>Initiate</EM> truly in the mysteries of the British
Museum, still only a <EM>Self</EM>-initiate -- from declaring
and insisting that <EM>the Atlantean </EM>submersion and Deluge
were only the anthropomorphized fancies of ignorant people; and
that Atlantis was no better than an <EM>astronomical allegory.
</EM>Nevertheless, the great Zodiacal allegory is based upon historical
events, and one can hardly interfere with the other; and it stands
also to reason that every student of Occultism knows what that
astronomical and zodiacal allegory means. Smith shows in the Nimrod
Epic of the Assyrian tablets the real meaning of it. Its &quot;<EM>twelve
cantos</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>refer to the &quot;annual course of
the Sun through the twelve months of the year. Each tablet answers
to a special month, and contains a distinct reference to the animal
forms in the signs of the Zodiac&quot;; the eleventh canto being
&quot;consecrated to Rimmon, the God of storms and of rain, and
harmonizes with the eleventh sign of the Zodiac -- Aquarius, or
the Waterman&quot; (<EM>Nineteenth Century,</EM> 1882,<EM> p</EM>.
236). But even this is preceded in the old records by the <EM>pre-</EM>astronomical
Cosmic FLOOD, which became allegorized and symbolized in the above
Zodiacal or Noah's Flood. But this has nothing to do with Atlantis.
The Pyramids are closely connected with the ideas of both the
Great Dragon (the constellation), the &quot;Dragons of Wisdom,&quot;
or the great Initiates of the Third and Fourth Races, and the
Floods of the Nile, regarded as a divine reminder of the great
Atlantic Flood. The astronomical records of Universal History,
however, are said to have had their beginnings with the Third
Sub-race of the Fourth Root-race or the Atlanteans. When was it?
Occult data show that even since the time of the regular establishment
of the Zodiacal calculations in Egypt, <EM>the poles have been
thrice inverted.</EM> 
<P>
We will presently return once more to this statement. Such symbols
as are represented by the Signs of the Zodiac -- a fact which
offers a handle to materialists upon which to hang their one-sided
theories and opinions -- have too profound a signification, and
their bearing upon our Humanity is too important to suffer dismissal
in a few words. Meanwhile, we have to consider the meaning of
that other statement which mentions (verse 48) the first <EM>divine
Kings, </EM>who are said to have &quot;redescended,&quot; guided
and <EM>instructed </EM>our Fifth Race after the last deluge!
<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 354 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</H6>

<P>
We shall consider this last claim historically in the sections
that follow, but must end with a few more details on the subject
of &quot;Serpents.&quot;
<P>
The rough commentaries on the Archaic Stanzas have to end here.
Further elucidation requires proofs obtained from ancient, mediaeval,
and modern works that have treated of these subjects. All such
evidence has now to be gathered in, collated and brought together
in better order, so as to compel the attention of the reader to
this wealth of historical proofs. And as the manifold meaning
of the weird symbol -- so often referred to and suggestive of
the &quot;tempter of man&quot; in the orthodox light of the church
-- can never be too strongly insisted upon, it seems more advisable
to exhaust the subject by every available proof at this juncture,
even at the risk of repetition. The Titans and Kabirs have been
invariably made out by our theologians and some pious symbologists
as indissolubly connected with the grotesque personage called
<EM>devil,</EM> and every proof to the contrary has been hitherto
as invariably rejected and ignored; therefore, the occultist must
neglect nothing which may tend to defeat this conspiracy of slander.
It is proposed to divide the subjects involved in these three
last verses into several groups, and examine them in this final
chapter as carefully and as fully as space permits. A few more
details may thus be added to the general evidences of antiquity,
on the most disputed tenets of Occultism and the Esoteric Doctrine
-- the bulk of which will be found in Part <STRONG>II</STRONG>.
on Symbology.

<STRONG>S</STRONG>ERPENTS AND <STRONG>D</STRONG>RAGONS UNDER DIFFERENT
<STRONG>S</STRONG>YMBOLISMS.
<P>
The name of the Dragon in Chaldea was not written phonetically,
but was represented by two monograms, <EM>probably </EM>meaning,
according to the Orientalists, &quot;the scaly one.&quot; &quot;This
description,&quot; very pertinently remarks G. Smith, &quot;of
course might apply either to a fabulous dragon, a serpent, or
a fish,&quot; and we may add: &quot;It applies in one case to
<EM>Makara, </EM>the tenth Zodiacal sign, meaning in Sanskrit
a non-descript amphibious animal, generally called Crocodile,
and really signifying something else. (<EM>Vide </EM>Part <STRONG>II</STRONG>.,
&quot;<EM>The Mysteries of the Hebdomad.</EM>&quot;) This, then,
is a virtual admission that the Assyriologists, at all events,
know nothing certain as to the status of the &quot;Dragon&quot;
in ancient Chaldea, whence the Hebrews got <EM>their </EM>symbolism,
only to be afterwards robbed of it by the Christians, who made
of the &quot;Scaly one&quot; a living entity and a maleficent
power.
<P>
A specimen of Dragons, &quot;winged and scaled,&quot; may be seen
in the British Museum. Representing the events of the Fall according
to the same authority, there are also two figures sitting on each
side of a tree, and holding out their hands to the &quot;apple,&quot;
while at the back of the &quot;Tree&quot;<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 355 THE NAASENIAN GNOSTICS.</H6>

<P>
is the Dragon-Serpent. Esoterically, the two figures are two &quot;Chaldees&quot;
ready for initiation, the Serpent symbolising the &quot;Initiator&quot;;
while the jealous gods, who curse the three, are the exoteric
profane clergy. Not much of the literal &quot;Biblical event&quot;
there, as any occultist can see.
<P>
&quot;The Great Dragon has respect but for the Serpents of Wisdom,&quot;
says the Stanza; thus proving the correctness of our explanation
of the two figures and the &quot;Serpent.&quot;
<P>
&quot;<EM>The Serpents who redescended </EM>. . . . <EM>who taught
and instructed</EM>&quot; the Fifth Race. What sane man is capable
of believing in our day that <EM>real</EM> serpents are hereby
meant? Hence the rough guess, now become almost an axiom with
the men of science, that those who wrote in antiquity upon various
sacred Dragons and Serpents either were superstitious and credulous
people, or were bent upon deceiving those more ignorant than themselves.
Yet, from Homer downwards, the term implied something hidden from
the profane.
<P>
&quot;Terrible are the gods when they manifest themselves&quot;
-- those <EM>gods</EM> whom men call <EM>Dragons. </EM>And AElianus,
treating in his &quot;<EM>De Natura</EM> <EM>Animalium</EM>&quot;<EM>
</EM>of these Ophidean symbols, makes certain remarks which show
that he understood well the nature of this most ancient of symbols.
Thus he most pertinently explains with regard to the above Homeric
verse -- &quot;For the Dragon, while sacred and to be worshipped,
<EM>has within</EM> <EM>himself something still more of the divine
nature </EM>of which it is better (for others?) to remain in ignorance&quot;
(Book xi., ch. 17).
<P>
This &quot;Dragon&quot; having a septenary meaning, the highest
and the lowest may be given. The former is identical with the
&quot;Self-born,&quot; the Logos (the Hindu <EM>Aja</EM>)<EM>.
</EM>He was the second person of the Trinity, the <STRONG>S</STRONG>ON,
with the Christian Gnostics called the Naasenians, or Serpent-Worshippers.
His symbol was the constellation of the Dragon.* Its seven &quot;stars&quot;
are the seven stars held in the hand of the &quot;Alpha and Omega&quot;
in <EM>Revelation. </EM>In its most terrestrial meaning, the term
&quot;Dragon&quot; was applied to the <EM>Wise </EM>men.
<P>
This portion of the religious symbolism of antiquity is very abstruse
and mysterious, and may remain incomprehensible to the profane.
In our modern day it so jars on the Christian ear that it can
hardly escape, all civilization notwithstanding, being regarded
as a direct denunciation of the most cherished Christian dogmas,
the subject of which required, to do it justice, the pen and genius
of Milton, whose poetical fiction has now taken root in the Church
as a revealed dogma.

* As shown by H. Lizeray in the &quot;Trinite Chretienne Devoilee&quot;

and mutable matter, the Dragon transmits to the latter the influences

Heaven originate with St. John, and in his <EM>Revelation? </EM>Emphatically
we answer -- No. His &quot;Dragon&quot; is Neptune, the symbol
of Atlantean magic.
<P>
To demonstrate the negation the reader is asked to examine the
symbolism of the Serpent or the Dragon under its several aspects.
<P>
-------
<P>
<STRONG>T</STRONG>HE <STRONG>S</STRONG>IDEREAL AND <STRONG>C</STRONG>OSMIC
<STRONG>G</STRONG>LYPHS.
<P>
Every astronomer -- besides Occultists and Astrologers -- knows
that, figuratively, the astral light, the milky way, and also
the path of the Sun to the tropics of Cancer and Capricorn, as
well as the circles of the Sidereal or Tropical year, were always
called &quot;Serpents&quot; in the allegorical and mystic phraseology
of the adepts.
<P>
This, cosmically, as well as metaphorically. Poseidon is a &quot;Dragon&quot;:
&quot;<EM>Chozzar, </EM>called by the profane Neptune&quot; (Peratae
Gnostics); the &quot;Good and Perfect Serpent,&quot; the Messiah
of the Naaseni, whose symbol in Heaven is <EM>Draco.</EM> 
<P>
But one ought to discriminate between the characters of this symbol.
For instance: Zoroastrian Esotericism is identical with that of
the Secret Doctrine; and when, as an example, we read in the <EM>Vendidad</EM>
complaints uttered against the &quot;Serpent,&quot; whose bites
have transformed the beautiful, eternal spring of Airyana-Vaego,
changing it into winter, generating disease and death, at the
same time as mental and psychic consumption, every occultist knows
that the Serpent alluded to is the north pole, as also the pole
of the heavens.* The latter produces the seasons according to
the angle at which it penetrates the centre of the earth. The
two axes were <EM>no more parallel</EM>;<EM> </EM>hence the eternal
spring of Airyana Vaego by the good river Daitya had disappeared,
and &quot;the Aryan Magi had to emigrate to Sagdiani&quot; --
say the exoteric accounts. But the esoteric teaching states that
the pole had passed through the equator, and that the &quot;land
of bliss&quot; of the Fourth Race, its inheritance from the Third,
had now become the region of desolation and woe. This alone ought
to be an incontrovertible proof of the great antiquity of the
Zoroastrian Scriptures. The Neo-Aryans of the post-diluvian age
could, of course, hardly recognise the mountains, on the summits
of which their forefathers had met <EM>before the Flood, </EM>and
conversed with the pure &quot;Yazathas&quot; (celestial Spirits
of the Elements), whose life and <EM>food </EM>they had once shared.
As shown by Eckstein (<EM>Revue Archeologique,</EM><STRONG> 8</STRONG><EM>th
year, </EM>1885), &quot;the Vendidad seems to point out a great
change in the atmosphere of central Asia; strong volcanic eruptions
and the collapse of a whole range of mountains in the neighbourhood
of the Kara-Korum chain.&quot;

* Symbolized by the Egyptians under the form of a Serpent with
a hawk's head.<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 357 THE TWO MYSTIC POLES. </H6>

<P>
The Egyptians, according to Eusebius, who for once (and for a
wonder) wrote the truth, symbolised Kosmos by a large fiery circle,
representing a serpent with a hawk's head lying across its diameter.
&quot;Here we have the pole of the earth within the plane of the
ecliptic, attended with all the fiery consequences that must arise
from such a state of the heavens: when the whole Zodiac in 25,000
(odd) years, must have reddened with the solar blaze, and <EM>each
sign must have been</EM> <EM>vertical </EM>to the polar region.&quot;
(<EM>See Mackey</EM>'<EM>s </EM>&quot;<EM>Sphinxiad.</EM>&quot;)
<P>
Meru -- the abode of the gods -- was placed, as before explained,
in the North Pole, while <EM>Patala, </EM>the nether region, was
supposed to lie in the South. As each symbol in esoteric philosophy
has <EM>seven keys,</EM> geographically, <EM>Meru</EM> and<EM>
Patala </EM>have one significance and represent localities; while
astronomically, they have another, and mean &quot;the two poles,&quot;
which meanings ended by their being often rendered in <EM>exoteric</EM>
sectarianism -- the &quot;Mountain&quot; and the &quot;Pit,&quot;
or Heaven and Hell. If we hold at present only to the astronomical
and geographical significance, it may be found that the ancients
knew the topography and nature of the Arctic and Antarctic regions
better than any of our modern astronomers; they had reasons, and
good ones for naming one the &quot;<EM>Mountain</EM>&quot; and
the other the &quot;<EM>Pit.</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>As the author
just quoted half explains, <EM>Helion </EM>and<EM> Acheron </EM>meant
nearly the same: &quot;<EM>Heli-on is the Sun in</EM> <EM>the
highest</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>(Helios, Heli-on, the &quot;most high&quot;);
&quot;and <EM>Acheron</EM> is 32 deg. above the pole, and 32 below
it, the allegorical river being thus supposed to touch the northern
horizon in the latitude of 32 degrees. The vast concave, that
is for ever hidden from our sight and which surrounded the southern
pole, being therefore called the <STRONG>P</STRONG>IT, while observing,
toward the Northern pole that a certain circuit in the heavens
always appeared above the horizon -- they called it the Mountain.
As Meru is the high abode of the Gods, these were said to <EM>ascend</EM>
and <EM>descend </EM>periodically; by which (astronomically) the
<EM>Zodiacal gods</EM> were meant, the passing of the original
North Pole of the Earth to the South Pole of the heaven.&quot;
&quot;In that age,&quot; adds the author of that curious work,
the &quot;<EM>Sphinxiad</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>and of &quot;<EM>Urania</EM>'<EM>s
Key to the Revelations</EM>&quot; -- &quot;at noon, the ecliptic
would be parallel with the meridian, and part of the Zodiac would
descend from the North Pole to the north horizon; crossing the
<EM>eight coils of the Serpent </EM>(eight sidereal years, or
over 200,000 solar years), which would seem like an imaginary
<EM>ladder</EM> with <EM>eight staves </EM>reaching from the earth
up to the pole, <EM>i.e</EM>., the throne of Jove. Up this ladder,
then, the Gods, <EM>i.e</EM>., the signs of the Zodiac, ascended
and descended. (Jacob's ladder and the angels) . . . . It is more
than 400,000 years since the Zodiac formed the sides of this ladder.&quot;
. . . .
<P>
This is an ingenious explanation, even if it is not altogether
free from occult heresy. Yet it is nearer the truth than many
of a more scientific<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 358 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</H6>

<P>
and especially theological character. As just said, the Christian
trinity was purely astronomical from its beginning, which made
Rutilius say -- of those who euhemerized <EM>it -- </EM>&quot;<EM>Judaea
gens, radix stultorum.</EM>&quot;
<P>
But the profane, and especially the Christian fanatics, ever in
search of scientific corroboration for their <EM>dead-letter </EM>texts,
will persist in seeing in the celestial pole the true Serpent
of Genesis, Satan, the Enemy of mankind, instead of what it is
-- a cosmic metaphor. <EM>When the</EM> <EM>gods are said to forsake
the earth, </EM>it does not only mean the gods, protectors and
instructors, but also the <EM>minor </EM>gods -- the regents of
the Zodiacal signs. Yet, the former, as actual and existing Entities
which gave birth to, nursed, and instructed mankind in its early
youth, appear in every Scripture, in that of the Zoroastrians
as much as in the Hindu Gospels. Ormazd, or Ahura-Mazda, the &quot;Lord
of Wisdom,&quot; is the synthesis of the Amshaspends (or <EM>Amesha-Spenta
-- </EM>&quot;<EM>Immortal</EM> Benefactors&quot;),* the &quot;Word,&quot;
however, or the <EM>Logos </EM>and its six highest aspects in
Mazdyanism. These &quot;Immortal Benefactors&quot; are described
<EM>in Zamyad yasht </EM>as the &quot;Amesha-Spentas, the shining,
having efficacious eyes, great, helpful . . . . imperishable and
pure which are all seven of like mind, like speech, all seven
doing alike . . . . which are <EM>the creators and destroyers
of the creatures </EM>of Ahura-Mazda, their creators and overseers,
their protectors and rulers . . . .&quot;
<P>
These few lines alone indicate the dual and even the triple character
of the Amshaspends, our Dhyan-Chohans or the &quot;Serpents of
Wisdom.&quot; They are identical with, and yet separate from Ormazd
(Ahura-Mazda). They are also the Angels of the Stars of the Christians
-- the Stary-azatas of the Zoroastrians -- or again the seven
planets (including the sun) of every religion.** The epithet --
&quot;the shining having efficacious eyes&quot; -- proves it.
This on the physical and sidereal planes. On the spiritual, they
are the divine powers of Ahura-Mazda; but on the astral or psychic
plane again, they are the &quot;Builders,&quot; the &quot;watchers,&quot;
the <EM>Pitar </EM>(fathers), and the first Preceptors of mankind.
<P>
When mortals shall have become sufficiently spiritualised, there
will be no more need of <EM>forcing </EM>them into a correct comprehension
of ancient Wisdom. Men will <EM>know </EM>then, that there never
yet was a great World-reformer, whose name has passed into our
generation, who (<EM>a</EM>) was not a direct emanation of the
<STRONG>L</STRONG>OGOS (under whatever name known to us), <EM>i.e.</EM>,
<EM>an essential </EM>incarnation of one of &quot;the seven,&quot;
of the &quot;divine Spirit who is sevenfold&quot;; and (<EM>b</EM>)
who had not appeared before, during the

** These &quot;seven&quot; became the eight, the <EM>Ogdoad, </EM>of
the later <EM>materialized </EM>religions, the seventh, or the

but becoming an anthropomorphic number, or additional unit.<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 359 GOD AND NATURE ANTHROPOMORPHIZED.</H6>

<P>
past Cycles. They will recognise, then, the cause which produces
in history and chronology certain riddles of the ages; the reason
why, for instance, it is impossible <EM>for them </EM>to assign
any reliable date to Zoroaster, who is found multiplied by twelve
and fourteen in the <EM>Dabistan</EM>; why the Rishis and Manus
are so mixed up in their numbers and individualities; why Krishna
and Buddha speak of themselves as <EM>re-incarnations, i.e., </EM>Krishna
is identified with the Rishi Narayana, and Gautama gives a series
of his previous births; and why the former, especially, being
&quot;the <EM>very supreme </EM>Brahma,&quot; is yet called <EM>Amsamsavatara
-- </EM>&quot;a part of a part&quot; only of the Supreme on Earth.
Finally, why Osiris is a great God, and at the same time a &quot;prince
on Earth,&quot; who reappears in Thoth-Hermes, and why Jesus (in
Hebrew, Joshua) of Nazareth is recognised, cabalistically, in
Joshua, the Son of Nun, as well as in other personages. The esoteric
doctrine explains it by saying that each of these (as many others)
had first appeared on earth as one of the seven powers of the
<STRONG>L</STRONG>OGOS, individualized as a God or &quot;Angel&quot;
(messenger); then, mixed with matter, they had re-appeared in
turn as great sages and instructors who &quot;taught the Fifth
Race,&quot; after having instructed the two preceding races, had
ruled during the Divine Dynasties, and had finally sacrificed
themselves, to be reborn under various circumstances for the good
of mankind, and for its salvation at certain critical periods;
until in their last incarnations they had become truly only &quot;the
parts of a part&quot; on earth, though <EM>de facto </EM>the One
Supreme in Nature.
<P>
This is the metaphysics of Theogony. And, as every &quot;Power&quot;
among the SEVEN has (once individualized) in his charge one of
the elements of creation, and rules over it,* hence the many meanings
in every symbol, which, unless interpreted according to the esoteric
methods, generally lead to an inextricable confusion.
<P>
Does the Western Kabalist -- generally an opponent of the Eastern
Occultist -- require a proof? Let him open Eliphas Levi's <EM>Histoire
de</EM> <EM>la Magic,</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>p. 53, and carefully
examine his &quot;<EM>Grand Symbole Kabalistique</EM>&quot;<EM>
</EM>of the Zohar. He will find, on the engraving given, a <EM>white
</EM>man standing erect and a <EM>black </EM>woman upside down,<EM>
i.e</EM>., standing on her head, her legs passing under the extended
arms of the male figure, and protruding behind his shoulders,
while their hands join at an angle on each side. Eliphas Levi
makes of it, God and Nature; or God, &quot;light,&quot; mirrored
inversely in &quot;Nature and Matter,&quot; darkness. Kabalistically
and symbolically he is right; but only so far as emblematical
cosmogony goes. Nor has he invented the symbol any more

<P>
than the Kabalists have: the two figures in white and black stone
have existed in the temples of Egypt from time immemorial -- agreeably
to tradition; and historically -- ever since the day of King Cambyses,
who personally saw them. Therefore the symbol must have been in
existence since nearly 2,500 years ago. This, at the very least,
for that Persian sovereign, who was a son of Cyrus the Great,
succeeded his father in the year 529 B.C. These figures were the
two <EM>Kabiri</EM> <EM>personifying the opposite poles. </EM>Herodotus
(<EM>Thalia, </EM>No. 77) tells posterity that when Cambyses entered
the temple of the Kabirim, he went into an inextinguishable fit
of laughter, on perceiving what he thought a man erect and a woman
standing on the top of her head before him. These were the poles,
however, whose symbol was intended to commemorate &quot;the passing
of the original North Pole of the Earth to the South Pole of the
Heaven,&quot; as perceived by Mackey.* But they represented also
the poles <EM>inverted, </EM>in consequence of the great inclination
of the axis, bringing each time as a result the displacement of
the Oceans, the submersion of the polar lands, and the consequent
<EM>upheaval </EM>of new continents in the equatorial regions,
and <EM>vice</EM> <EM>versa. </EM>These Kabirim were the &quot;Deluge&quot;
gods.
<P>
This may help us to get at the key of the seemingly hopeless confusion
among the numbers of names and titles given to one and the same
gods, and classes of gods. Faber showed already, at the beginning
of this century, the identity of the Corybantes, Curetes, Dioscuri,
Anactes, Dii Magni, Idei Dactyli, Lares, Penates, Manes,** Titans,
and Aletae with the<STRONG> K</STRONG>ABIRI. And we have shown
that the latter were the same as the Manus, the Rishis and our
Dhyan Chohans, who incarnated in the Elect of the Third and Fourth
Races. Thus, while in Theogony the Kabiri-Titans were seven great
gods: cosmically and astronomically the Titans were called Atlantes,
because, perhaps, as Faber says, they were connected

* Who adds that the Egyptians had various ways of representing
the angles of the Poles. Also in Perry's <EM>View of the Levant
</EM>there is &quot;a figure representing the South Pole of the
Earth in the constellation of the Harp,&quot; in which the poles
appear like two <EM>straight rods, </EM>surmounted with hawks'
wings, but they were also often represented as serpents with heads
of hawks, one at each end.
<P>
** Faber and Bishop Cumberland would make them all the later pagan
personifications, as the former writer has it, of &quot;the Noetic
Ark, and no other than the Patriarch (Noah) and his family&quot;
(!) <EM>See his </EM>&quot;<EM>Kabiri,</EM>&quot;<EM> Vol.</EM><STRONG>
I</STRONG><EM>., </EM>136; because, we are told, &quot;after the
Deluge in commemoration of the event, the pious Noachidae had
established a religious festival, which was, later on, corrupted
by their <EM>impious </EM>descendants; demons or hero-gods; and
at length unblushing obscenity usurped the name and garb of religion&quot;
(<EM>Vol. I., p. </EM>10.). Now this is indeed putting an extinguisher
upon the human reasoning powers, not only of antiquity, but even
of our present generations. Reverse the statement, and explain
after the words &quot;Noah and his family&quot; that what is meant
by that patriarch and family is simply the Jewish version of a
Samothracian mystery, of <EM>Saturn, or Kronos-Sadic and his Sons,
</EM>and then we may say <EM>Amen.</EM> <HR>

(<EM>a</EM>) <EM>with At-al-as </EM>&quot;the divine Sun,&quot;
and (<EM>b</EM>) with <EM>tit </EM>&quot;the deluge.&quot; But
this, if true, is only the exoteric version. Esoterically, the
meaning of their symbols depends on the appellation, or title,
used. The seven mysterious, awe-inspiring great gods -- the <EM>Dioscuri</EM>,*
the deities surrounded with the darkness of occult nature -- become
the <EM>Idei </EM>(or Idaeic finger) with the adept-healer by
metals. The true etymology of the name <EM>lares </EM>(now signifying
&quot;ghosts&quot;) must be sought in the Etruscan word &quot;<EM>lars</EM>,&quot;
&quot;conductor,&quot; &quot;leader.&quot; Sanchoniathon translates
the word <EM>Aletae </EM>as fire worshippers, and Tabor believes
it derived from <EM>Al-Orit, </EM>&quot;the god of fire.&quot;
Both are right, as in both cases it is a reference to the Sun
(the highest God), toward whom the planetary gods &quot;gravitate&quot;
(astronomically and allegorically) and whom they worship. As <EM>Lares,
</EM>they are truly the Solar Deities, though Faber's etymology,
who says that &quot;<EM>lar</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>is a contraction
of &quot;<EM>El-Ar,</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>the solar deity, is not
very correct. They are the &quot;lares,&quot; the conductors and
leaders of men. As <EM>Aletae, </EM>they were the seven planets
-- astronomically; and as <EM>Lares,</EM> the regents of the same,
our protectors and rulers -- mystically. For purposes of exoteric
or phallic worship, as also cosmically, they were the Kabiri,
their attributes being recognised in these two capacities by the
name of the temples to which they respectively belonged, and those
of their priests. They all belonged, however, to the Septenary
creative and informing groups of Dhyan Chohans. The Sabeans, who
worshipped the &quot;regents of the Seven planets&quot; as the
Hindus do their Rishis, held Seth and his son Hermes (Enoch or
<EM>Enos</EM>)<EM> </EM>as the highest among the planetary gods.
Seth and Enos were borrowed from the Sabeans and then disfigured
by the Jews (exoterically); but the truth can still be traced
about them even in <EM>Genesis.** </EM>Seth is the &quot;progenitor&quot;
of those early men of the Third Race in whom the &quot;Planetary&quot;
angels had incarnated -- a Dhyan Chohan himself, who belonged
to the <EM>informing </EM>gods; and Enos (Hanoch or Enoch) or
Hermes, was said to be <EM>his son</EM> -- because it was a generic
name for all the early <EM>Seers </EM>(&quot;Enoichion&quot;).
Thence the worship. The Arabic writer Soyuti says that the earliest
records mention Seth, or <EM>Set, </EM>as the founder of Sabeanism;
and therefore that the pyramids which embody the planetary system
were regarded as the place of sepulchre of both Seth and <EM>Idris
</EM>(Hermes or Enoch), (<EM>See Vyse, </EM>&quot;<EM>Operations,</EM>&quot;<EM>
Vol. II., p. </EM>358); that thither Sabeans proceeded

who incarnated in the Seven Elect of the Third Race.

** Clement of Alexandria recognized the astronomical significance
of chapter xxv. <EM>et seq. </EM>of Exodus. According to the Mosaic
doctrine, he says that the seven planets help in the generation
of terrestrial things. The two cherubs standing on the two sides
of the sacred tetragrammaton represent the Ursa Major and Ursa
Minor.<HR>

<EM>turning to the</EM> <EM>North </EM>(the Mount Meru, Kaph,
Olympus, etc., etc.) (<EM>See Palgrave,</EM> <EM>Vol. II., p.
</EM>264). Abd Allatif says curious things about the Sabeans and
their books. So does Eddin Ahmed Ben Yahya, who wrote 200 years
later. While the latter maintains &quot;that each pyramid was
consecrated <EM>to a star</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>(a star <EM>regent
</EM>rather), Abd Allatif assures us &quot;that he had read in
Sabean books that one pyramid was the tomb of Agathodaemon and
the other of Hermes&quot; (<EM>Vyse, Vol. II., p. </EM>342). &quot;Agathodaemon
was none other than Seth, and, according to some writers, Hermes
was his son,&quot; adds Mr. Staniland Wake in &quot;<EM>The Great
Pyramid,</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>p. 57.
<P>
Thus, while in Samothrace and the oldest Egyptian temples they
were the great Cosmic Gods (the seven and the <EM>forty-nine </EM>Sacred
Fires), in the Grecian fanes their rites became mostly phallic,
therefore to the profane, obscene. In the latter case they were
3 and 4, or 7 -- the male and female principles -- (the <EM>crux
ansata</EM>);<EM> </EM>this division showing why some classical
writers held that they were only three, while others named four.
And these were -- the Kabiri -- Axieros (in his female aspect,
Demeter); Axio-Kersa (Persephone)*; Axiokersos (Pluto or Hades);
and Kadmos or Kadmilos (Hermes -- not the ithyphallic Hermes mentioned
by Herodotus (<STRONG>II</STRONG>. 51) but &quot;he of the sacred
legend,&quot; explained only during the Samothracian mysteries).
This identification, due, according to the Scholiast Apollon (Rh.
I. 217), to an indiscretion of Mnaseas, is none at all, as names
alone do not reveal much. There were still others again who maintained,
being as right in their way, that there were only two Kabiri.
These were, esoterically, the two Dioscuri, Castor and Pollux,
and exoterically, Jupiter and Bacchus. The two personified the
terrestrial poles, geodesically; the terrestrial, and the pole
of the heavens -- astronomically, as also the physical and the
spiritual man. The story of Semele and Jupiter and the birth of
Bacchus, the <EM>Bimater, </EM>with all the circumstances attending
it, needs only to be read esoterically to understand the allegory.
The parts played in the event by the fire, water, earth, etc.,
in the many versions, will show how &quot;the father of the gods&quot;
<H6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
</H6>

<P>
* It is a curious idea -- yet one not very far from the truth,
perhaps -- that speculation of Mackey, the self-made Adept of
Norwich, found in his &quot;Mythological Astronomy.&quot; He says
that the Kabiri named Axieros and Axiokersa derived their names
(<EM>a</EM>) from <EM>Kab </EM>or<EM> Cab, </EM>a measure, and
from <EM>Urim</EM>, the heavens: the Kabirim being thus &quot;a
measure of the heavens&quot;; and (<EM>b</EM>) that their distinctive
names, implying the <EM>principle of generation, </EM>referred
to the sexes. For, &quot;the word <EM>sex </EM>was formerly understood
by <EM>aix</EM>; which has now settled . . . . into sex.&quot;
And he refers to &quot;Encyclopaedia Londinus&quot; at the word
&quot;<EM>aspiration.</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>Now if we give the aspirated
sound to Axieros, it would be <EM>Saxieros</EM>;<EM> </EM>and
the other pole would be <EM>Saxiokersa. </EM>The two poles would
thus become the generators of the other powers of nature -- they
would be the <EM>parents: </EM>therefore the most powerful gods.
<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 363 THE POLES, THE &quot;HEAVENLY MEASURE.&quot;
</H6>

<P>
and the &quot;merry God of the wine&quot; were also made to personify
the two terrestrial Poles. The telluric, metalline, magnetic,
electric and the fiery elements are all so many allusions and
references to the cosmic and astronomic character of the diluvian
tragedy. In astronomy, the poles are indeed the &quot;heavenly
measure&quot; (<EM>vide</EM> note<EM> supra</EM>);<EM> and </EM>so
are the Kabiri <EM>Dioscuri, </EM>as will be shown, and the Kabiri-Titans,
to whom Diodorus ascribes the <EM>invention of fire* </EM>and
the art of manufacturing iron. Moreover, Pausanias shows that
the original Kabiric deity was Prometheus. (I. ix. p. 751.)
<P>
But the fact that, astronomically, the Titans-Kabirim were also
the generators and regulators of the seasons, and cosmically the
great Volcanic Energies, the gods presiding over all the metals
and terrestrial works, does not prevent them from being, in their
original divine characters, the beneficent Entities who, symbolized
in Prometheus, brought light to the world, and endowed humanity
with intellect and reason. They are pre-eminently in every theogony
-- especially in the Hindu -- the sacred divine fires, 3, 7, or
49, according as the allegory demands it. Their very names prove
it, as they are the <EM>Agni-putra</EM> (Sons of the Fire) in
India, and the genii of the fire under numerous names in Greece
and elsewhere. Welcker, Maury, and now Decharme, show the name
Kabeiron meaning &quot;the powerful through fire,&quot; from the
Greek word <EM>[[kaio]] </EM>&quot;to burn.&quot; The Semitic
<EM>Kabirim, </EM>&quot;the powerful, the mighty, and the great,&quot;
answering to the Greek [[<EM>megaloi dunatoi</EM>]], are later
epithets. They were universally worshipped, and their origin is
lost in the night of time. Yet whether propitiated in Phrygia,
Phoenicia, the Troad, Thrace, Egypt, Lemnos or Sicily, their cult
was always connected with fire; their temples ever built in the
most volcanic localities, and in exoteric worship they belonged
to Chthonian divinities. Therefore Christianity has made of them
<EM>infernal gods. </EM>
<P>
They are truly &quot;the great, beneficent and powerful Gods,&quot;
as Cassius Hermone calls them (<EM>See Macrob. Sat. I., iii.,
c. 4, p</EM>. 376). At Thebes, Kore and Demeter, the <EM>Kabirim,
</EM>had a sanctuary (<EM>Pausan. IX.</EM> 22; 5)<EM>,</EM> and
at Memphis, the Kabiri had a temple so sacred, that none, excepting
the priests, were suffered to enter their holy precincts (<EM>Herodotus
I. ii.,</EM> <EM>c. </EM>37). But we must not lose sight, at the
same time, of the fact that the title of Kabiri was a generic
one; that the Kabiri (the <EM>mighty </EM>gods as well as mortals),
were of both sexes, as also terrestrial, celestial and kosmic.
That, while in their later capacity of the Rulers of sidereal
and terrestrial powers, a purely geological phenomenon (as it
is now

regarded) was symbolized in the persons of those rulers, they
were also, in the beginning of times, the rulers of mankind. When
incarnated as Kings of the &quot;divine Dynasties,&quot; they
gave the first impulse to civilizations, and directed the mind
with which they had endued men to the invention and perfection
of all the arts and sciences. Thus the Kabiri are said to have
appeared as the benefactors of men, and as such they lived for
ages in the memory of nations. To them -- the Kabiri or Titans
-- is ascribed the invention of letters (the <EM>Devanagari, </EM>or
the alphabet and language of the gods), of laws and legislature;
of architecture, as of the various modes of magic, so-called;
and of the medical use of plants. Hermes, Orpheus, Cadmus, Asclepius,
all those demi-gods and heroes, to whom is ascribed the revelation
of sciences to men, and in whom Bryant, Faber, Bishop Cumberland,
and so many other Christian writers -- too zealous for plain truth
--would force posterity to see only pagan copies of one and sole
prototype, named Noah -- are all generic names.
<P>
It is the Kabiri who are credited with having revealed, by <EM>producing</EM>
corn or wheat, the great boon of agriculture. What <EM>Isis-Osiris,
the</EM> once living Kabiria, has done in Egypt, that Ceres is
said to have done in Sicily; they all belong to one class.
<P>
That the Serpents were ever the emblems of wisdom and prudence
is again shown by the caduceus of Mercury, one with Thot, the
god of wisdom, with Hermes, and so on. The two serpents, entwined
around the rod, are phallic symbols of Jupiter and other gods
who transformed themselves into snakes for purposes of seducing
goddesses -- but only in the unclean fancies of profane symbologists.
The serpent has ever been the symbol of the adept, and of his
powers of immortality and divine knowledge. Mercury in his psychopompic
character, conducting and guiding with the caduceus the souls
of the dead to Hades and even raising the dead to life with it,
is simply a very transparent allegory. It shows the dual power
of the Secret Wisdom: the black and the white magic. It shows
this personified Wisdom guiding the Soul after death, and its
power to call to life that which is dead -- a very deep metaphor
if one thinks over its meaning. Every people of antiquity reverenced
this symbol, with the exception of Christians, who chose to forget
the brazen Serpent of Moses, and even the implied acknowledgment
of the great wisdom and prudence of the Serpent by Jesus himself,
&quot;Be ye <EM>wise </EM>as serpents and harmless as doves.&quot;
The Chinese, one of the oldest nations of our Fifth Race, made
of it the emblem of their Emperors, who are thus the degenerate
successors of the &quot;Serpents&quot; or Initiates, who ruled
the early races of the Fifth Humanity. The Emperor's throne is
the &quot;Dragon's Seat,&quot; and his dresses of State are embroidered
with the likeness of the<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 365 THE VARIOUS NOAHS.</H6>

Dragon. The aphorisms in the oldest books of China, moreover,
say plainly that the &quot;Dragon&quot; is a human, albeit <EM>divine,
</EM>Being. Speaking of the &quot;Yellow Dragon,&quot; the chief
of the others, the <EM>Twan-ying-t</EM>'<EM>u, says:</EM> &quot;His
wisdom and virtue are unfathomable . . . he does not go in company
and does not live in herds (he is an ascetic). He wanders in the
wilds beyond the heavens. He goes and comes, fulfilling the decree
(Karma); at the proper seasons if there is perfection he comes
forth, if not he remains (invisible).&quot;. . . And Kon-fu-tyu
is made to say by Lu-lan, &quot;The Dragon feeds in the pure water
of Wisdom and sports in the clear waters of Life.&quot;

Now Atlantis and the Phlegyan isle are not the only record that
is left of the deluge. China has also her tradition and the story
of an island or continent, which it calls Ma-li-ga-si-ma, and
which Kaempfer and Faber spell &quot;Maurigosima,&quot; for some
mysterious phonetic reasons of their own. Kaempfer, in his &quot;<EM>Japan</EM>&quot;<EM>
</EM>(<EM>Appendix, p. </EM>13), gives the tradition: The island,
owing to the iniquity of its giants, sinks to the bottom of the
ocean, and Peiru-un, the king, the Chinese Noah, escapes alone
with his family owing to a warning of the gods through two idols.
It is that pious prince and his descendants who have peopled China.
The Chinese traditions speak of the divine dynasties of Kings
as much as those of any other nations.

At the same time there is not an old fragment but shows belief
in a multiform and even multigeneric evolution -- spiritual, psychic,
intellectual and physical -- of human beings, just as given in
the present work. A few of these claims have now to be considered.

the Akkadian <EM>Dingir</EM> and<EM> Mul-lil</EM> -- the creative
god and the &quot;Gods of the ghost-world&quot;; with the Egyptian
Isis-Osiris and Thot; with the Hebrew Elohim, or again with Manco
Capac and his Peruvian progeny -- the story varies nowhere. Every
nation has Amshaspends* (six exoterically), ten and seven Chaldean
Anedots,

ten and seven Sephiroth, etc., etc. One and all have been derived
from the primitive Dhyan-Chohans of the Esoteric doctrine, or
the &quot;Builders&quot; of the Stanzas (Book I.). From Manu,
Thot-Hermes, Oannes-Dagon, and Edris-Enoch, down to Plato and
Panadores, all tell us of seven <EM>divine </EM>Dynasties, of
seven Lemurian, and seven Atlantean divisions of the Earth; of
the seven primitive and dual gods who descend from their celestial
abode* and reign on Earth, teaching mankind Astronomy, Architecture,
and all the other sciences that have come down to us. These Beings
appear first as &quot;gods&quot; and Creators; then they merge
in nascent man, to finally emerge as &quot;divine-Kings and Rulers.&quot;
But this fact has been gradually forgotten. As Bosuage shows,
the Egyptians themselves confessed that science flourished in
their country only since Isis-Osiris, whom they continue to adore
as gods, &quot;though they had become Princes in human form.&quot;
And he adds of Osiris-Isis (the divine androgyne: -- &quot;It
is said that this Prince (Isis-Osiris) built cities in Egypt,
stopped the overflowing of the Nile; invented agriculture, the
use of the vine, music, astronomy, and geometry.&quot;

astronomy. In the &quot;Melelwa Nohil&quot; (<EM>MS. 47 in Nic.

Geraldinus gives curious traditions about Henoch. He calls him
the &quot;divine giant.&quot; In the &quot;<EM>Book of</EM> <EM>the
various names of the Nile,</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>the same author
(the historian Ahmed-Ben-Yusouf Eltiphas) tells us of the belief
among the Semitic Arabs that Seth (become later the Egyptian Typhon,
Set), had been one of the seven angels (or Patriarchs in the Bible):
then he became a mortal and Adam's son, after which he communicated
the gift of prophecy and astronomical science to Jared, who passed
it to his son Henoch. But Henoch (Idris) &quot;the author of thirty
books, was Sabaean by origin&quot; (<EM>i.e</EM>., belonging to
the <EM>Saba, </EM>&quot;a Host&quot;); &quot;having established
the rites and ceremonies of primitive worship, he went to the
East, where he constructed 140 cities, of which Edessa was the
least important, then returned to Egypt where he became its King.&quot;
Thus, he is identified with Hermes. But there were five Hermes
-- or rather one, who appeared -- as some Manus and Rishis did
-- in several different characters. In the <EM>Burham-i-Kati </EM>he
is mentioned as &quot;Hormig,&quot; a name of the planet Mercury

tradition, worshipped at Phineata and said to have fled after
the death of Argus into Egypt, civilized it under the name of
Thoth. But under whichever of these characters, he is always credited
with having transferred all the sciences from <EM>latent to active

There were more efforts made by the modern historians (French
Academicians, like Renan, chiefly) to suppress truth by ignoring
the ancient annals of <EM>divine </EM>Kings, than is strictly
consistent with honesty. But M. Renan could never be more unwilling
than was Eratosthenes 260 years B.C. to accept the unpalatable
fact; and yet the latter found himself obliged to recognise its
truth. For this, the great astronomer is treated with great contempt
by his colleagues 2,000 years later. Manetho became with them
&quot;a superstitious priest born and bred in the atmosphere of

now vindicated the good faith of the priests of Egypt (Manetho's
above all), and that of Ptolemy. In the Turin papyrus, the most
remarkable of all, in the words of the Egyptologist, de Rouge:

&quot;. . . Champollion, struck with amazement, found that he

papyrus we have to arrive at the conviction that so far back already
as the period of Ramses, those mythic and heroical traditions
were just as Manetho had transmitted them to us; we see figuring
in them, as Kings of Egypt, the gods Seb, Osiris, Horus, Thoth-Hermes,
and the goddess Ma, a long period of centuries being assigned
to the reign of each of these.&quot; (<EM>Ann. de Philologie Chretienne,
</EM>Vol. <STRONG>XXXII</STRONG>., p. 442).
<P>
The synchronistic tables of Manetho, besides the fact that they
were disfigured by Eusebius for dishonest purposes, had never
gone beyond Manetho. The chronology of the divine Kings and Dynasties,
like that of the age of humanity, has ever been in the hands of
the priests, and was kept secret from the profane multitudes.
<P>
Africa, as a continent, it is said, appeared before Europe did;
nevertheless it appeared later than Lemuria and even the earliest
Atlantis. That the whole region of what is now Egypt and the deserts
was once upon a time covered with the sea, was known firstly through
Herodotus, Strabo, Pliny, and all the Greeks; and, secondly, through
geology. Abyssinia was once upon a time an island; and the Delta
was the first country occupied by the pioneer emigrants who came
with their gods from the North-east.
<P>
When was it? History is silent upon the subject. Fortunately we
have the Dendera Zodiac, the planisphere on the ceiling of one
of the oldest Egyptian temples, which records the fact. This Zodiac,
with its mysterious three <EM>Virgos </EM>between the <EM>Lion
</EM>and <EM>Libra, </EM>has found its OEdipus, who understood
the riddle of these signs, and justified the truthfulness of those
priests who told Herodotus that: -- (<EM>a</EM>) The poles of
the Earth and the Ecliptic had formerly coincided; and (<EM>b</EM>)
That even since their first Zodiacal records were commenced, the
Poles have been three times within the plane of the Ecliptic,
as the Initiates taught.

Nearly five hundred years before the actual era, Herodotus was
shown by the priests of Egypt the statues of their human Kings
and Pontiffs<EM>-piromis </EM>(the archi-prophets or Maha-Chohans
of the temples), <EM>born one from the other </EM>(without the
intervention of woman) who had reigned before Menes, their first
<EM>human </EM>King. These statues, he says, were enormous colossi
in wood, three hundred and forty-five in number, <EM>each of which
had his name, his history and his annals. </EM>And they assured
Herodotus* (unless the most truthful of historians, the &quot;Father
of History,&quot; is now accused of fibbing, <EM>just in this
instance</EM>) that no historian could ever understand or write
an account of these superhuman Kings, unless he had studied and
learned the history <EM>of the three dynasties </EM>that preceded
the human -- namely, the DYNASTIES OF THE GODS, that of demi-gods,
and of the Heroes, or giants. These &quot;three dynasties&quot;
are the three Races.**
<P>
Translated into the language of the Esoteric doctrine, these three
dynasties would also be those of the Devas, of Kimpurushas, and
of Danavas and Daityas -- otherwise gods, celestial spirits, and
giants or Titans. &quot;Happy are those who are born, even from
the condition of gods, as men, in Bharata-Varsha!&quot; exclaim
the incarnated gods themselves, during the Third Root-Race. Bharata
is India, but in this case it symbolized the chosen land in those
days, and was considered the best of the divisions of Jambu-dwipa,
as it was the land of active (spiritual) works <EM>par excellence</EM>;<EM>

As de Rougemont shows, Theopompus, in his <EM>Meropis, </EM>made
the priests of Phrygia and Asia Minor speak exactly as the priests
of Sais did when they revealed to Solon the history and fate of
Atlantis. According to Theopompus, it was a unique continent of
an indefinite size, and containing two countries inhabited by
<EM>two races -- </EM>a fighting, warrior race, and a pious, meditative
race,* which Theopompus symbolizes by two cities.** The pious
&quot;city&quot; was <EM>continually visited by</EM> <EM>the gods</EM>;<EM>
</EM>the belligerent &quot;city&quot; was inhabited by various
beings <EM>invulnerable </EM>to iron, liable to be <EM>mortally

this as a pure <EM>fiction </EM>of Theopompus (&quot;<EM>Peuple

(<EM>supercherie</EM>)<EM> </EM>in the assertion of the Saitic
priests. This was denounced by the &quot;Demonologists&quot; as
illogical. In the words of De Mirville: -- &quot;A<EM> supercherie

whole antiquity; a <EM>supposition </EM>which yet gave its name
to a whole mountain chain (the Atlas); which specified with the

its lands at a small distance from Cadiz and the strait of Calpetus),
which prophesied, 2,000 years before Columbus, <EM>the great</EM>
<EM>trans-oceanic land </EM>situated beyond that Atlantis and

&quot;If one has to lend ear to traditions,&quot; writes the very
unbelieving Boulanger, (&quot;<EM>Regne des Dieux,</EM>&quot;<EM>
Introduction</EM>) <EM>. </EM>. . &quot;the latter place before
the reign of Kings, that of the Heroes and demi-gods; and still
earlier and beyond they place the marvellous reign of the gods
and all the fables of the golden age. . . . One feels surprised
that annals so interesting should have been rejected by almost
all our historians. And yet the ideas communicated by them were
once universally admitted and revered by all the peoples; not
a few revere them still, making them the basis of their daily
life. Such considerations seem to necessitate a less hurried judgment.
. . . The ancients, from whom we hold these traditions, which
<EM>we accept no longer because</EM> <EM>we do not understand
them now, </EM>must have had motives for believing in them furnished
by their greater proximity to the first ages, and which the distance
that separates us from them refuses to us . . . . Plato in his
fourth book of <EM>Laws, </EM>says that, long before the construction
of the first cities, Saturn had established on earth a <EM>certain
</EM>form of government under which man was very happy. As it
is the golden age he refers to, or to that reign of gods so celebrated
in ancient fables . . . . let us see the ideas he had of that
happy age, and what was the occasion he had to introduce this
<EM>fable </EM>into a treatise on politics. According to Plato,
in order to obtain clear and precise ideas on royalty, its origin
and power, one has to turn back to the first principles of history
and tradition. Great changes, he says, have occurred in days of
old, <EM>in heaven and on earth, </EM>and the present state of
things is one of the results (<EM>Karma</EM>).<EM> </EM>Our traditions
tell us of many marvels, of changes that have taken place in the
course of the Sun, of Saturn's reign, and of a thousand other
matters that remained scattered about in human memory; but <EM>one
never hears anything of the </EM><STRONG>EVIL </STRONG><EM>which

<EM>produced those revolutions, nor of the evil which directly
followed them. </EM>Yet . . . . that Evil is the principle one
has to talk about, to be able to treat of royalty and the origin
of power. . . .&quot;
<P>
That <EM>evil</EM>, Plato seems to see in the sameness or consubstantiality
of the natures of the rulers and the ruled, for he says that long
before man built his cities, in the golden age, there was naught
but happiness on earth, for there were no needs. Why? Because
Saturn, knowing that man could not rule man, without injustice
filling forthwith the universe through his whims and vanity, would
not allow any mortal to obtain power over his fellow creatures.
To do this the god used the same means we use ourselves with regard
to our flocks. We do not place a bullock or a ram over our bullocks
and rams, but give them a leader, a shepherd, <EM>i.e., a being
of a species quite different from their own and of</EM> <EM>a
superior nature. </EM>It is just what Saturn did. He loved mankind
and placed to rule over it no mortal King or prince but -- &quot;Spirits
and genii [[<EM>daimones</EM>]] of a divine nature more excellent
than that of man.&quot;
<P>
It was god, the Logos (the synthesis of the Host) who thus presiding
over the genii, became the first shepherd and leader of men.*
When the world had ceased to be so governed and the gods retired,
&quot;ferocious beasts devoured a portion of mankind.&quot; &quot;Left
to their own resources and industry, inventors then appeared among
them successively and discovered fire, wheat, wine; and public
gratitude deified them . . . .&quot;(&quot;<EM>De Legibus</EM>&quot;<EM>
</EM>1<EM>, iv.</EM>;<EM> in Crit. and in Politic</EM>).
<P>
And mankind was right, as fire by friction was the first mystery
of nature, the first and chief property of matter that was revealed
to man.

&quot;<EM>Fruits and grain, unknown to Earth to that day, were

. . &quot; say the Commentaries. Now: &quot;The earliest inventions
(?) of mankind are the most wonderful that the race has ever made.
. . The <EM>first use of fire, </EM>and the discovery of the methods
by which it can be kindled; the domestication of animals; and,
above all, <EM>the processes by which the various cereals were
first developed </EM>out of some wild grasses (?) -- these are
all <EM>discoveries with which, in ingenuity and in importance,</EM>
<EM>no subsequent discoveries may compare. </EM>They are all unknown
to history -- all lost in the light of an EFFULGENT DAWN.&quot;

This will be doubted and denied in our proud generation. But if
it is asserted that there are no grains and fruits <EM>unknown

Seb. The &quot;region for the manes seven cubits high,&quot; (for
the yet imperfect mummies), and the region for those &quot;<EM>in

three </EM>cubits high,&quot; is as clear as possible. The Egyptians

earth)&quot;? And then comes a long break in this chapter vi.
of Genesis, between verses 4 and 5. For surely, it was not in
or through the wickedness of the &quot;mighty men&quot; . . .
. men of renown, among whom is placed Nimrod the &quot;mighty
hunter before the Lord,&quot; that &quot;god saw that the wickedness
of man <EM>was </EM>great,&quot; nor in the builders of Babel,
for this was <EM>after </EM>the Deluge; but in the progeny of
the giants who produced <EM>monstra quaedam de genere giganteo,</EM>
monsters from whence sprang the lower races of men, now represented
on earth by a few miserable dying-out tribes and the huge anthropoid
apes.
<P>
And if we are taken to task by theologians, whether Protestant
or Roman Catholic, we have only to refer them to their own literal
texts. The above quoted verse was ever a dilemma, not alone for
the men of science and Biblical scholars, but also for priests.
For, as the Rev. Father Peronne puts it: -- &quot;Either they
(the B'ne-aleim) were good angels, and in such case how could
they fall? Or they were bad (angels) and in this case could not
be called <EM>b</EM>'<EM>ne-aleim, </EM>the &quot;sons of <EM>God.</EM>&quot;<EM>
</EM>(<EM>Praelectiones theol. ch. </EM>ii.) This Biblical riddle
-- &quot;the real sense of which no author has ever understood,&quot;
as candidly confessed by Fourmont** -- can only be explained by
the Occult doctrine, through the Zohar to the Western, and the
<EM>Book of Dzyan </EM>to the Eastern. What the former says we
have seen; what the Zohar tells us is this: <EM>B</EM>'<EM>ne-aleim
</EM>was a name common to the <EM>Malachim </EM>(the good Messengers)
and to the <EM>Ischin </EM>(&quot;the lower angels&quot;)<EM>
</EM>(<EM>Rabbi Parcha</EM>).
<P>
We may add for the benefit of the demonologists that their Satan,

&quot;the adversary,&quot; is included in <EM>Job </EM>among the
sons of God or <EM>b</EM>'<EM>ne-aleim</EM> who visit their father.&quot;
(<EM>Chapter i.</EM>)<EM> </EM>But of this later on.
<P>
Now the Zohar says that the <EM>Ischin, </EM>the beautiful <EM>B</EM>'<EM>ne-aleim</EM>,
were <EM>not </EM>guilty, but mixed <EM>themselves with mortal
men because they were sent</EM> <EM>on earth to do so.</EM> (<EM>Book
of Ruth and Schadash</EM>;<EM> fol. </EM>63,<EM> col. </EM>3;<EM>
Amsterdam edition</EM>)<EM>. </EM>Elsewhere the same volume shows
these <EM>b</EM>'<EM>ne-aleim</EM> belonging to the tenth sub-division
of the &quot;Thrones&quot; (<EM>Zohar, part iii.,</EM> <EM>col.
</EM>113<EM>. But see also 1st vol. </EM>184). It also explains
that the Ischin, &quot;men-spirits,&quot; <EM>viri</EM> <EM>spirituales,
</EM>now that men can see them no longer, help magicians to produce,
through their science, <EM>homunculi </EM>which are not <EM>small
men </EM>but &quot;men <EM>smaller </EM>(in the sense of <EM>inferiority</EM>)<EM>
</EM>than men.&quot; Both show themselves under the form that
the Ischin had then, <EM>i.e</EM>., gaseous and ethereal. Their
chief is Azazel.
<P>
But Azazel, whom the Church dogma will associate with Satan, is
nothing of the kind. Azazel is a <EM>mystery, </EM>as explained
elsewhere, and it is so expressed in Maimonides, &quot;<EM>In
More Nevochim</EM>&quot;<EM> </EM>(<EM>chapter xxvi., p. </EM>8).
&quot;There is an impenetrable mystery in the narrative concerning
Azazel.&quot; And so there is, as Lanci, a librarian to the Vatican
and one who ought to know, says -- we have quoted him before --
that &quot;this venerable divine name (<EM>nome divino e venerabile</EM>)
has become through the pen of Biblical scholars, a <EM>devil,
</EM>a wilderness, a mountain, and a he-goat&quot; (<EM>Sagra
Scrittura</EM>).<EM> </EM>Therefore it seems foolish to derive
the name as Spencer does, from Ajal (separated) and El (god),
hence &quot;one separated from God,&quot; the <STRONG>D</STRONG>EVIL.
In the Zohar, Azazel is rather the Sacrificial victim than the
&quot;formal adversary of Jehovah,&quot; as Spencer would have
it (<EM>II., pp. </EM>14, 29).
<P>
The amount of malicious fancy and fiction bestowed on that &quot;Host&quot;
by various fanatical writers is quite extraordinary. Azazel and
his &quot;host&quot; are simply the Hebrew &quot;Prometheus,&quot;
and ought to be viewed from the same standpoint. The Zohar shows
the <EM>Ischin </EM>chained on the mountain in the desert, allegorically;
thus simply alluding to those &quot;spirits&quot; as being chained
to the earth during the cycle of incarnation. Azazel (or Azaziel)
is one of the chiefs of the &quot;transgressing&quot; angels in
<EM>Enoch, </EM>who descending upon Ardis, the top of Mount Armon,
bound themselves by swearing loyalty to each other. It is said
that Azaziel taught men to make swords, knives, shields, to fabricate
mirrors (?) to make <EM>one see what is behind him</EM> (<EM>viz.,</EM>
&quot;<EM>magic mirrors</EM>&quot;).<EM> </EM>Amazarak taught
all the sorcerers and dividers of roots; Amers taught the solution
of magic; Barkayal, astrology; Akibeel, the meaning of portents
and signs; Tamial, astronomy; and Asaradel taught the motion of
the moon. &quot;These seven were the first instructors of the
Fourth man&quot; (<EM>i.e., </EM>of the <EM>Fourth </EM>Race).
But why should allegory be always understood as meaning all that
its dead-letter expresses?<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 377 THE FALLACIES OF THE TWO CHURCHES.</H6>

<P>
It is the symbolical representation of the great struggle between
divine wisdom, <EM>nous, </EM>and its earthly reflection, <EM>Psuche,
</EM>or between Spirit and Soul, in Heaven and on Earth. In Heaven
--because the divine <STRONG>M</STRONG>ONAD had voluntarily exiled
itself therefrom, to descend, for incarnating purposes, to a lower
plane and thus transform the animal of clay <EM>into an immortal
god. </EM>For, as Eliphas Levi tells us, &quot;the angels aspire
to become men; for the perfect man, the man-god, is above even
angels.&quot; On Earth -- because no sooner had Spirit descended
than it was strangled in the coils of matter.
<P>
Strange to say, the Occult teaching reverses the characters; it
is the anthropomorphous archangel with the Christians, and the
man-like God with the Hindus, which represent matter in this case;
and the Dragon, or Serpent, Spirit. Occult symbolism furnishes
the key to the mystery; theological symbolics conceal it still
more. For the former explains many a saying in the Bible and even
in the New Testament which have hitherto remained incomprehensible;
while the latter, owing to its dogma of Satan and his rebellion,
has belittled the character and nature of its would-be infinite,
absolutely perfect god, and created the greatest evil and curse
on earth -- belief in a personal Devil. This mystery is opened
with the key to its metaphysical symbolism now restored; while
that of theological interpretation shows the gods and the archangels
standing as symbols for the dead letter or dogmatic religions,
and as arrayed against the pure truths of Spirit, naked and unadorned
with fancy.
<P>
Many were the hints thrown out in this direction in &quot;Isis
Unveiled,&quot; and a still greater number of references to this
mystery may be found scattered throughout these volumes. To make
the point clear once for all: that which the clergy of every dogmatic
religion -- pre-eminently the Christian -- points out as Satan,
the enemy of God, is in reality, the highest divine Spirit --
(occult Wisdom on Earth) -- in its naturally antagonistic character
to every worldly, evanescent illusion, dogmatic or ecclesiastical
religions included. Thus, the Latin Church, intolerant, bigoted
and cruel to all who do not choose to be its slaves; the Church
which calls itself the bride of Christ, and the trustee at the
same time of Peter, to whom the rebuke of the Master &quot;get
thee behind me Satan&quot; was justly addressed; and again the
Protestant Church which, while calling itself Christian, paradoxically
replaces the New Dispensation by the old &quot;Law of Moses&quot;
which Christ openly repudiated: both these Churches are fighting
against divine Truth, when repudiating and slandering the Dragon
of esoteric (because <EM>divine</EM>) Wisdom. Whenever anathematizing
the Gnostic Solar Chnouphis -- the Agathodaemon -- Christos, or
the theosophical Serpent of Eternity, or even the Serpent of Genesis
-- they<HR>

<P>
are moved by the same Spirit of dark fanaticism that moved the
Pharisees to curse Jesus by saying to him &quot;Say we not well
thou hast a devil?&quot;
<P>
Read the account about Indra (Vayu) in the <EM>Rig-Veda, </EM>the
occult volume <EM>par excellence </EM>of Aryanism, and then compare
it with the same in the Puranas -- the exoteric version thereof,
and the purposely garbled account of the true Wisdom religion.
In the Rig Veda Indra is the highest and greatest of the Gods,
and his Soma-drinking is allegorical of his highly spiritual nature.
In the Puranas Indra becomes a profligate, and a regular drunkard
on the Soma juice, in the terrestrial way. He is the conqueror
of all the &quot;enemies of the gods&quot; -- the Daityas, Nagas
(Serpents), Asuras, all the <EM>Serpent-</EM>gods,<EM> </EM>and
of Vritri, the Cosmic Serpent. Indra is the St. Michael of the
Hindu Pantheon -- the chief of the <EM>militant </EM>Host. Turning
to the Bible, we find Satan, one of the &quot;Sons of God&quot;
(<EM>Job. i.</EM> 6), becoming in exoteric interpretation the
Devil, and the Dragon in its infernal, evil sense. But in the
Kabala (&quot;<EM>Book</EM> <EM>of Numbers</EM>&quot;) Samael,
who is Satan, is shown to be identical with St. Michael, the <EM>slayer
of the Dragon. </EM>How is this? For it is said that Tselem (the
image) reflects alike Michael and Samael <EM>who are one. </EM>Both
proceed, it is taught, from <EM>Ruach </EM>(Spirit),<EM> Neschamah
</EM>(Soul) and <EM>Nephesch </EM>(life). In the &quot;Chaldean
Book of Numbers&quot; Samael is the concealed (occult) Wisdom,
and Michael the higher <EM>terrestrial </EM>Wisdom, both emanating
from the same source but diverging after their issue from <EM>the
mundane soul, </EM>which on Earth is Mahat (intellectual understanding,
<EM>or Manas </EM>(the seat of Intellect). They diverge, because
one (Michael) is <EM>influenced </EM>by Neschamah, while the other
(Samael) remains <EM>uninfluenced. </EM>This tenet was perverted
by the dogmatic spirit of the Church; which, loathing independent
Spirit, uninfluenced by the external form (hence by dogma), forthwith
made of Samael-Satan (the most wise and spiritual spirit of all)
-- the adversary of its anthropomorphic God and sensual physical
man, the DEVIL!
