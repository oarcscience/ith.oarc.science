(*a*.) The Mother of Mercy and Knowledge is called "the triple" of
Kwan-Shai-Yin because in her correlations, metaphysical and cosmical,
she is the "Mother, the Wife and the Daughter" of the *Logos*, just as
in the later theological translations she became "the Father, Son and
(the female) Holy Ghost" -- the *Sakti* or Energy -- the Essence of the
three. Thus in the Esotericism of the Vedantins, *Daiviprakriti*, the
Light manifested through Eswara, the *Logos,\*\** is at one and the same
time the Mother and also the Daughter of the Logos or Verbum of
Parabrahmam; while in that of the trans-Himalayan teachings it is -- in
the hierarchy of allegorical and metaphysical theogony -- "the
**M**OTHER" or abstract, ideal matter, Mulaprakriti, the Root of Nature;
-- from the metaphysical standpoint, a correlation of Adi-Bhuta,
manifested in the Logos, Avalokiteshwara; -- and from the purely occult

\* This stanza is translated from the Chinese text, and the names, as
the equivalents of the original terms, are preserved. The real esoteric
nomenclature cannot be given, as it would only confuse the reader. The
Brahmanical doctrine has no equivalent to these. Vach seems, in many an
aspect, to approach the Chinese Kwan-yin, but there is no regular
worship of Vach under this name in India, as there is of Kwan-Yin in
China. No exoteric religious system has ever adopted a female Creator,
and thus woman was regarded and treated, from the first dawn of popular
religions, as inferior to man. It is only in China and Egypt that
Kwan-Yin and Isis were placed on a par with the male gods. Esotericism
ignores both sexes. Its highest Deity is sexless as it is formless,
neither Father nor Mother; and its first manifested beings, celestial
and terrestrial alike, become only gradually androgynous and finally
separate into distinct sexes.

Bhagavadgita.

Cosmical, Fohat,\* the "Son of the Son," the androgynous energy
resulting from this "Light of the Logos," and which manifests in the
plane of the objective Universe as the hidden, as much as the revealed,
Electricity -- which is **L**IFE.

(*b*) *Kwan-Yin-Tien* means the "melodious heaven of Sound," the abode
of Kwan-Yin, or the "*Divine Voice*" literally. This "Voice" is a
synonym of the *Verbum* or the Word: "Speech," as the expression of
thought. Thus may be traced the connection with, and even the origin of
the Hebrew *Bath-Kol*, the "daughter of the Divine Voice," or *Verbum,*
or the male and female Logos, the "Heavenly Man" or Adam Kadmon, who is
at the same time Sephira. The latter was surely anticipated by the Hindu
Vach, the goddess of Speech, or of the Word. For Vach -- the daughter
and the female portion, as is stated, of Brahma, one "generated by the
gods" -- is, in company with Kwan-Yin, with Isis (also the *daughter*,
wife and *sister* of Osiris) and other goddesses, the female *Logos,* so
to speak, the goddess of the *active* forces in Nature, the Word, Voice
or Sound, and Speech. If Kwan-Yin is the "melodious Voice," so is Vach;
"the melodious cow who milked forth sustenance and water" (the female
principle) -- "who yields us nourishment and sustenance," as
Mother-Nature. She is associated in the work of creation with the
Prajapati. She is male and female *ad libitum*, as Eve is with Adam. And
she is a form of Aditi -- the principle higher than *Ether* -- in Akasa,
the synthesis of all the forces in Nature; thus Vach and Kwan-Yin are
both the magic potency of Occult sound in Nature and Ether -- which
"Voice" calls forth Sien-Tchan, the illusive form of the Universe out of
Chaos and the Seven Elements.

Thus in Manu Brahma (the *Logos* also) is shown dividing his body into
two parts, male and female, and creating in the latter, who is Vach,
Viraj, who is himself, or Brahma again -- it is in this way a learned
Vedantin Occultist speaks of that "goddess," explaining the reason why
Eswara (or Brahma) is called *Verbum* or *Logos*; why in fact it is
called Sabda Brahmam: --

###### \[\[Footnote(s)\]\] -------------------------------------------------

\* Says the lecturer on p. 306: "Evolution is commenced by the
intellectual energy of the *Logos*, not merely on account of the
potentialities locked up in *Mulaprakriti.* This light of the Logos is
the link . . . between objective matter and the subjective thought of
*Eswara* (or Logos). It is called in several Buddhist books *Fohat.* It
is the one instrument with which the *Logos* works."

------------------------------------------------------------------------

###### \[\[Vol. 1, Page\]\] 138 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.

"The explanation I am going to give you will appear thoroughly mystical;
but if mystical, it has a tremendous significance when properly
understood. Our old writers said that *Vach* is of four kinds (see Rig
Veda and the Upanishads). *Vaikhari-Vach* is what we utter. Every kind
of *Vaikhari-Vach* exists in its *Madhyama*, further in its *Pasyanti*,
and ultimately in its *Para* form.\* The reason why this Pranava is
called Vach is this, that the four principles of the great Kosmos
correspond to these four forms of *Vach.* Now the whole manifested solar
System exists in its *Sukshma* form in the light or energy of the
*Logos*, because its energy is caught up and transferred to Cosmic
matter. . . . The whole Kosmos in its objective form is *Vaikhari-Vach*,
the light of the *Logos* is the *Madhyama* form, and the Logos itself
the *Pasyanti* form, and Parabrahm the *Para* form or aspect of that
Vach. It is by the light of this explanation that we must try to
understand certain statements made by various philosophers to the effect
that the manifested Kosmos is the *Verbum* manifested as Kosmos" (see
Lecture on the Bhagavadgita, referred to above).

the differentiation of the elements which enter into the constitution of
our Solar System. It has often been asked what was the exact definition
of Fohat and his powers and functions, as he seems to exercise those of
a Personal God as understood in the popular religions. The answer has
just been given in the comment on Stanza V. As well said in the
Bhagavadgita Lectures, "The whole Kosmos must necessarily exist in the
One Source of energy from which this light (*Fohat*) emanates." Whether
we count the principles in Kosmos and man as seven or only as four, the
forces of, and in, physical Nature are Seven; and it is stated by the
same authority that "*Pragna*, or the capacity of perception, exists in
seven different aspects corresponding to the seven conditions of matter"
(*Personal and impersonal God*)*.* For, "just as a human being is
composed of seven principles, differentiated matter in the Solar System
exists in seven different conditions" (*ibid*)*.* So does Fohat.\* He is
One and Seven, and on the Cosmic plane is behind all such manifestations
as light, heat, sound, adhesion, etc., etc., and is the "spirit" of
**E**LECTRICITY, which is the **L**IFE of the Universe. As an
abstraction, we call it the **O**NE **L**IFE; as an objective and
evident Reality, we speak of a septenary scale of manifestation, which
begins at the upper rung with the One Unknowable **C**AUSALITY, and ends
as Omnipresent Mind and Life immanent in every atom of Matter. Thus,
while science speaks of its evolution through brute matter, blind force,
and senseless motion, the Occultists point to *intelligent* **L**AW and
*sentient* **L**IFE, and add that Fohat is the guiding Spirit of all
this. Yet he is no personal god at all, but the emanation of those other
Powers behind him whom the Christians call the "Messengers" of their God
(who is in reality only the Elohim, or rather one of the Seven Creators
called Elohim), and we, the "Messenger of the primordial Sons of Life
and Light."

"Universe") from Tien-Sin (the "Heaven of Mind," literally, or that
which is absolute) are the Atoms of Science and the Monads of Leibnitz.

personifies having formed our Septenary chain.

3\. **O**F THE SEVEN (*elements*) -- FIRST ONE MANIFESTED, SIX
CONCEALED; TWO MANIFESTED -- FIVE CONCEALED; THREE MANIFESTED -- FOUR
CONCEALED; FOUR PRODUCED -- THREE HIDDEN; FOUR AND ONE TSAN (*fraction*)
REVEALED -- TWO AND ONE HALF CONCEALED; SIX TO BE MANIFESTED -- ONE LAID
ASIDE (*a*). LASTLY, SEVEN SMALL WHEELS REVOLVING; ONE GIVING BIRTH TO
THE OTHER (*b*).

(*a.*) Although these Stanzas refer to the whole Universe after a
Mahapralaya (universal destruction), yet this sentence, as any student
of Occultism may see, refers also by analogy to the evolution and final
formation of the primitive (though compound) Seven Elements on our
Earth. Of these, four elements are now fully manifested, while the fifth
-- Ether -- is only partially so, as we are hardly in the second half of
the Fourth Round, and consequently the fifth Element will manifest fully
only in the Fifth Round. The Worlds, including our own, were of course,
as germs, primarily evolved from the ONE Element in its second stage
("Father-Mother," the differentiated World's Soul, not what is termed
the "Over-Soul" by Emerson), whether we call it, with modern Science,
Cosmic dust and Fire Mist, or with Occultism -- Akasa, Jivatma, divine
Astral Light, or the "Soul of the World." But this first stage of
Evolution was in due course of time followed by the next. No world, as
no heavenly body, could be constructed on the objective plane, had not
the Elements been sufficiently differentiated already from their
primeval *Ilus*, resting in *Laya.* The latter term is a synonym of
Nirvana. It is, in fact, the Nirvanic dissociation of all substances,
merged after a life-cycle into the latency of their primary conditions.
It is the luminous but bodiless shadow of the matter *that was*, the
realm of negativeness -- wherein lie latent during their period of rest
the active Forces of the Universe. Now, speaking of Elements, it is made
the standing reproach of the Ancients, that they "supposed their
Elements simple and undecomposable."\* Once more this is an
unwarrantable state-

###### \[\[Footnote(s)\]\] -------------------------------------------------

\* The shades of our pre-historical ancestors might return the
compliment to modern physicists, now that new discoveries in chemistry
have led Mr. Crookes, **F.R.S**., to admit that Science is yet a
thousand leagues from the knowledge of the compound nature of the
simplest molecule. From him we learn that such a thing as a really

ment; as, at any rate, their initiated philosophers can hardly come
under such an imputation, since it is they who have invented allegories
and religious myths from the beginning. Had they been ignorant of the
Heterogeneity of their Elements they would have had no personifications
of Fire, Air, Water, Earth, and AEther; their Cosmic gods and goddesses
would never have been blessed with such posterity, with so many sons and
daughters, elements born *from* and *within each respective Element*.
Alchemy and occult phenomena would have been a delusion and a snare,
even in theory, had the Ancients been ignorant of the potentialities and
correlative functions and attributes of every element that enters into
the composition of Air, Water, Earth, and even *Fire* -- the latter a
terra incognita to this day to modern Science, which is obliged to call
it Motion, evolution of light and heat, state of ignition, -- defining
it by its outward aspects in short, and remaining ignorant of its
nature. But that which

###### \[\[Footnote(s)\]\] -------------------------------------------------

\[\[Footnote continued from previous page\]\] molecule entirely
homogeneous is *terra incognita* in chemistry. "Where are we to draw the
line?" he asks; "is there no way out of this perplexity? Must we either
make the elementary examinations so stiff that only 60 or 70 candidates
can pass, or must we open the examination doors so wide that the number
of admissions is limited only by the number of applicants?" And then the
learned gentleman gives striking instances. He says: "Take the case of
yttrium. It has its definite atomic weight, it behaved in every respect
as a simple body, an element, to which we might indeed add, but from
which we could not take away. Yet this yttrium, this supposed
homogeneous whole, on being submitted to a certain method of
fractionation, is resolved into portions not absolutely identical among
themselves, and exhibiting a gradation of properties. Or take the case
of didymium. Here was a body betraying all the recognised characters of
an element. It had been separated with much difficulty from other bodies
which approximated closely to it in their properties, and during this
crucial process it had undergone very severe treatment and very close
scrutiny. But then came another chemist, who, treating this assumed
homogeneous body by a peculiar process of fractionation, resolved it
into the two bodies praseodymium and neodymium, between which certain
distinctions are perceptible. Further, we even now have no certainty
that neodymium and praseodymium are simple bodies. On the contrary, they
likewise exhibit symptoms of splitting up. Now, if one supposed element
on proper treatment is thus found to comprise dissimilar molecules, we
are surely warranted in asking whether similar results might not be
obtained in other elements, perhaps in all elements, if treated in the
right way. We may even ask where the process of sorting-out is to stop
-- a process which of course pre-supposes variations between the
individual molecules of each species. And in these successive
separations we naturally find bodies approaching more and more closely
to each other." (Presidential address before the Royal Society of
Chemists, March, 1888.)

modern Science seems to fail to perceive is that, differentiated as may
have been those simple chemical atoms -- which archaic philosophy called
"the creators of their respective Parents," fathers, brothers, husbands
of their mothers, and those mothers the daughters of their own sons,
like Aditi and Daksha, for example -- differentiated as these elements
were in the beginning, still, they were not the compound bodies known to
science, as they are now. Neither Water, Air, Earth (synonym for solids
generally) existed in their present form, representing the three states
of matter alone recognised by Science; for all these are the productions
already recombined by the atmospheres of globes completely formed --
even to fire -- so that in the first periods of the earth's formation
they were something quite *sui generis.* Now that the conditions and
laws ruling our solar system are fully developed; and that the
atmosphere of our earth, as of every other globe, has become, so to say,
a crucible of its own, Occult Science teaches that there is a perpetual
exchange taking place in space of molecules, or of atoms rather,
correlating, and thus changing their combining equivalents on every
planet. Some men of Science, and those among the greatest physicists and
chemists, begin to suspect this fact, which has been known for ages to
the Occultists. The spectroscope only shows the probable similarity (on
external evidence) of terrestrial and sidereal substance; it is unable
to go any farther, or to show whether atoms gravitate towards one
another in the same way and under the same conditions as they are
supposed to do on our planet, physically and chemically. The scale of
temperature, from the highest degree to the lowest that can be conceived
of, may be imagined to be one and the same in and for the whole
Universe; nevertheless, its properties, other than those of dissociation
and reassociation, differ on every planet; and thus atoms enter into new
forms of existence, undreamt of, and incognizable to, physical Science.
As already expressed in "Five Years of Theosophy," the essence of
Cometary matter, for instance, "is totally different from any of the
chemical or physical characteristics with which the greatest chemists
and physicists of the earth are acquainted" (p. 242). And even that
matter, during rapid passage through our atmosphere, undergoes a certain
change in its nature. Thus not alone the elements of our planets, but
even those of all its sisters in the Solar System, differ as widely from
each other in their combinations, as from the Cosmic elements beyond our

Solar limits.\* Therefore, they cannot be taken as a standard for
comparison with the same in other worlds.\*\* Enshrined in their virgin,
pristine state within the bosom of the Eternal Mother, every atom born
beyond the threshold of her realm is doomed to incessant
differentiation. "The Mother sleeps, yet is ever breathing." And every
breath sends out into the plane of manifestation her Protean products,
which, carried on by the wave of the efflux, are scattered by Fohat, and
driven toward and beyond this or another planetary atmosphere. Once
caught by the latter, the atom is lost; its pristine purity is gone for
ever, unless Fate dissociates it by leading it to "a current of EFFLUX"
(an occult term meaning quite a different process from that which the
ordinary term implies); when it may be carried once more to the
borderland where it had perished, and taking its flight, not into Space
*above* but into Space *within*, it will be brought under a state of
differential equilibrium and happily re-absorbed. Were a truly learned
Occultist-alchemist to write the "Life and Adventures of an Atom" he
would secure thereby the eternal scorn of the modern chemist, perchance
also his subsequent

###### \[\[Footnote(s)\]\] -------------------------------------------------

\* This is again corroborated by the same man of science in the same
lecture, who quotes Clerk Maxwell, saying "that the elements are not
absolutely homogeneous." He writes: "It is difficult to conceive of
selection and elimination of intermediate varieties, for where can these
eliminated molecules have gone to, if, as we have reason to believe, the
hydrogen, &c. of the fixed stars is composed of molecules identical in
all respects with our own." And he adds: "In the first place we may call
in question this absolute molecular identity, since we have hitherto had
no means for coming to a conclusion save the means furnished by the
spectroscope, while it is admitted that, for accurately comparing and
discriminating the spectra of two bodies, they should be examined under
identical states of temperature, pressure, and all other physical
conditions. We have certainly seen, in the spectrum of the sun, rays
which we have not been able to identify."

\*\* "Each world has its Fohat, who is omnipresent in his own sphere of
action. But there are as many Fohats as there are worlds, each varying
in power and degree of manifestations. The individual Fohats make one
Universal, Collective Fohat -- the aspect-Entity of the one absolute
Non-Entity, which is absolute Be-Ness, 'SAT.' "Millions and billions of
worlds are produced at every Manvantara" -- it is said. Therefore there
must be many Fohats, whom we consider as conscious and *intelligent*
Forces. This, no doubt, to the disgust of scientific minds. Nevertheless
the Occultists, who have good reasons for it, consider all the forces of
Nature as veritable, though supersensuous, states of Matter; and as
possible objects of perception to Beings endowed with the requisite
senses.

cold and radiant and gets hot and corrupt*, *to cool once more, and be
purified in the eternal bosom of inner Space*," says the Commentary. Man
absorbs cold pure air on the mountain-top, and throws it out impure, hot
and transformed. Thus -- the higher atmosphere being the mouth, and the
lower one the lungs of every globe -- the man of our planet breathes
only the refuse of "Mother"; therefore, "he is doomed to die on it."\*\*

(*b*) The process referred to as "the small wheels giving birth, one to

of the most material world of all in the manifested Kosmos -- our
terrestrial plane. These "Seven Wheels" are our planetary chain (see
Commentary Nos. 5 and 6). By "Wheels" the various spheres and centres of
forces are generally meant; but in this case they refer to our septenary
ring.

because the **L**AW for the birth, growth, and decay of everything in
Kosmos, from the Sun to the glow-worm in the grass, is **O**NE. It is an
everlasting work of perfection with every new appearance, but the
Substance-Matter and Forces are all one and the same. But this **L**AW
acts on every planet through minor and varying laws. The "imperishable
Laya Centres" have a great importance, and their meaning must be fully
understood if we would have a clear conception of the Archaic Cosmogony,
whose theories have now passed into Occultism. At present, one thing may
be stated. The worlds are built neither *upon*, nor *over*, nor *in* the
*Laya* centres, the zero-point being a condition, not any mathematical
point.

(*b*) Bear in mind that Fohat, the constructive Force of Cosmic
Electricity, is said, metaphorically, to have sprung like Rudra from
Brahma "from the brain of the Father and the bosom of the Mother," and
then to have metamorphosed himself into a male and a female, *i.e.*,
polarity, into positive and negative electricity. He has *seven sons*
who are *his brothers;* and Fohat is forced to be born time after time
whenever any two of his son-brothers indulge *in too close contact* --
whether an embrace or a fight. To avoid this, he binds together and
unites those of unlike nature and separates those of similar
temperaments. This, of course, relates, as any one can see, to
electricity generated by friction and to the law involving attraction
between two objects of unlike, and repulsion between those of like
polarity. The Seven "Sons-brothers," however, represent and personify
the seven forms of Cosmic magnetism called in *practical Occultism* the
"Seven Radicals," whose co-operative and active progeny are, among other
energies, Electricity, Magnetism, Sound, Light, Heat, Cohesion, etc.
Occult Science defines all these as Super-sensuous effects in their
hidden behaviour, and as objective phenomena in the world of senses; the
former requiring abnormal faculties to perceive them -- the latter, our
ordinary physical senses. They all pertain to, and are the emanations
of, still more supersensuous spiritual qualities, not personated by, but
belonging to, real and conscious CAUSES. To attempt a description of
such ENTITIES would be worse than useless. The reader must bear in mind
that, according to our teaching which regards this phenomenal Universe
as a great *Illusion*, the nearer a body is to the **U**NKNOWN
**S**UBSTANCE, the more it approaches *reality*, as being removed the
farther

from this world of *Maya.* Therefore, though the molecular constitution
of their bodies is not deducible from their manifestations on this plane
of consciousness, they nevertheless (from the standpoint of the adept
Occultist) possess a distinctive objective if not material structure, in
the relatively noumenal -- as opposed to the phenomenal -- Universe. Men
of science may term them Force or Forces generated by matter, or "modes
of its motion," if they will; Occultism sees in the effects "Elemental"
(forces), and, in the direct causes producing them, intelligent
**D**IVINE Workmen. The intimate connection of those Elementals (guided
by the unerring hand of the Rulers) -- their correlation we might call
it -- with the elements of pure Matter, results in our terrestrial
phenomena, such as light, heat, magnetism, etc., etc. Of course we shall
never agree with the American Substantialists\* who call every Force and
Energy -- whether Light, Heat, Electricity or Cohesion -- an "Entity";
for this would be equivalent to calling the noise produced by the
rolling of the wheels of a vehicle an *Entity* -- thus confusing and
identifying that "noise" with the driver *outside*, and the guiding
Master Intelligence *within* the vehicle. But we certainly give that
name to the "drivers" and to these guiding Intelligences -- the ruling
Dhyan Chohans, as shown. The "Elementals," the Nature-Forces, are the
acting, though invisible, or rather imperceptible, secondary Causes and
in themselves the effects of primary Causes behind the Veil of all
terrestrial phenomena. Electricity, light, heat, etc., have been aptly
termed the "Ghost or Shadow of Matter in Motion," *i.e.*, supersensuous
states of matter whose effects only we are able to cognize. To expand,
then, the simile given above. The sensation of light is like the sound
of the rolling wheels -- a purely phenomenal effect, having no existence
outside the observer; the proximate exciting cause of the sensation is
comparable to the driver -- a supersensuous state of matter in motion, a
Nature-Force or Elemental. But, behind even this, stand -- just as the
owner of the carriage directs the driver from within -- the higher and
*noumenal* causes, the *Intelligences* from whose essence radiate these
States of "*Mother*," generating the countless milliards of Elementals
or psychic Nature-Spirits, just as every drop of water generates its
physical

infinitesimal Infusoria. (See "Gods, Monads, and Atoms," in Part III.)
It is Fohat who guides the transfer of the principles from one planet to
the other, from one star to another -- child-star. When a planet dies,
its informing principles are transferred to a *laya* or sleeping centre,
with potential but latent energy in it, which is thus awakened into life
and begins to form itself into a new sidereal body. (*Vide infra*, "A
Few Theosophical Misconceptions, etc.")

It is most remarkable that, while honestly confessing their entire
ignorance of the true Nature of even terrestrial matter -- primordial
substance being regarded more as a dream than as a sober reality -- the
physicists should set themselves up as judges, nevertheless, of that
matter, and claim to know what it is able and is not able to do, in
various combinations. Scientists know it (matter) hardly skin-deep, and
yet they will dogmatise. It is "a mode of motion" and nothing else. But
the *force* that is inherent in a living person's breath, when blowing a
speck of dust from the table, is also, and undeniably, "a mode of
motion"; and it is as undeniably not a quality of the matter, or the
particles of that speck, and it emanates from the living and thinking
Entity that breathed, whether the impulse originated consciously or
unconsciously. Indeed, to endow matter -- something of which nothing is
known so far -- with an inherent quality called Force, of the nature of
which still less is known, is to create a far more serious difficulty
than that which lies in the acceptation of the intervention of our
"Nature-Spirits" in every natural phenomenon.

The Occultists, who do not say -- if they would express themselves
correctly -- that *matter*, but only the *substance* or *essence* of
matter, is indestructible and eternal, (*i.e.*, the Root of all,
*Mulaprakriti*)*:* assert that all the so-called Forces of Nature,
Electricity, Magnetism, Light, Heat, etc., etc., far from being modes of
motion of material particles, are *in esse*, *i.e.*, in their ultimate
constitution, the differentiated aspects of that Universal Motion which
is discussed and explained in the first pages of this volume (*See
Proem*)*.* When Fohat is said to produce "Seven Laya Centres," it means
that for formative or creative purposes, the **G**REAT **L**AW (Theists
may call it God) stops, or rather modifies its perpetual motion on seven
invisible points within the area of the manifested Universe. "*The great
Breath digs through Space seven holes into Laya to cause them to
circumgyrate during Manvantara*" (Occult Catechism). We

have said that Laya is what Science may call the Zero-point or line; the
realm of absolute negativeness, or the one real absolute Force, the
NOUMENON of the Seventh State of that which we ignorantly call and
recognise as "Force"; or again the Noumenon of Undifferentiated Cosmic
Substance which is itself an unreachable and unknowable object to finite
perception; the root and basis of all states of objectivity and
subjectivity too; the neutral axis, not one of the many aspects, but its
centre. It may serve to elucidate the meaning if we attempt to imagine a
neutral centre -- the dream of those who would discover perpetual
motion. A "neutral centre" is, in one aspect, the limiting point of any
given set of senses. Thus, imagine two consecutive planes of matter as
already formed; each of these corresponding to an appropriate set of
perceptive organs. We are forced to admit that between these two planes
of matter an incessant circulation takes place; and if we follow the
atoms and molecules of (say) the lower in their transformation upwards,
these will come to a point where they pass altogether beyond the range
of the faculties we are using on the lower plane. In fact, to us the
matter of the lower plane there vanishes from our perception into
nothing -- or rather it passes on to the higher plane, and the state of
matter corresponding to such a point of transition must certainly
possess special and not readily discoverable properties. Such "Seven
Neutral Centres,"\* then, are produced by Fohat, who, when, as Milton
has it --

quickens matter into activity and evolution.

The *Primordial Atom* (*anu*) cannot be multiplied either in its
pregenetic state, or its primogeneity; therefore it is called "SUM
TOTAL," figuratively, of course, as that "SUM TOTAL" is boundless. (See
Addendum to this Book.) That which is the abyss of nothingness to the
physicist, who knows only the world of visible causes and effects, is
the boundless Space of the Divine *Plenum* to the Occultist. Among many
other objections to the doctrine of an endless evolution and
re-involution (or re-absorption) of the Kosmos, a process which,
according to the Brahminical and Esoteric Doctrine, is without a
beginning or an end, the Occultist is told that it cannot be, since "by
all the admissions of

calls the "Etheric Centres."

modern scientific philosophy it is a necessity of Nature to run down."
If the tendency of Nature "to run down" is to be considered so forcible
an objection to Occult Cosmogony, "How," we may ask, "do your
Positivists and Free-thinkers and Scientists account for the phalanx
around us of active stellar systems?" They had eternity to "run down"
in; why, then, is not the Kosmos a huge inert mass? Even the moon is
only hypothetically believed to be a dead planet, "run down," and
astronomy does not seem to be acquainted with many such dead planets.\*
The query is unanswerable. But apart from this it must be noted that the
idea of the amount of "transformable energy" in our little system coming
to an end is based purely on the fallacious conception of a "white-hot,
incandescent Sun" perpetually radiating away his heat without
compensation into Space. To this we reply that nature runs down and
disappears from the objective plane, only to re-emerge after a time of
rest out of the subjective and to reascend once more. Our Kosmos and
Nature will run down only to reappear on a more perfect plane after
every **P**RALAYA. The *matter* of the Eastern philosophers is not the
"matter" and Nature of the Western metaphysicians. For what is Matter?
And above all, what is our scientific philosophy but that which was so
justly and so politely defined by Kant as "the Science of the *limits*
to our Knowledge"? Where have the many attempts made by Science to bind,
to connect, and define all the phenomena of organic life by mere
physical and chemical manifestations, brought it to? To speculation
generally -- mere soap-bubbles, that burst one after the other before
the men of Science were permitted to discover real facts. All this would
have been avoided, and the progress of knowledge would have proceeded
with gigantic strides, had only Science and its philosophy abstained
from accepting hypotheses on the mere one-sided Knowledge of *their*
Matter.\*\*

sidereal lunatic.

even when based on the strictest mathematical analysis. The famous
hypothesis of the formation of our Solar System out of the nebulous
rings, put \[\[Footnote continued on next page\]\]

If no physical intellect is capable of counting the grains of sand
covering a few miles of sea-shore; or to fathom the ultimate nature and
essence of those grains, palpable and visible on the palm of the
naturalist, how can any materialist limit the laws changing the
conditions and being of the atoms in primordial chaos, or know anything
certain about the capabilities and potency of their atoms and molecules
before and after their formation into worlds? These changeless and
eternal molecules -- far thicker in space than the grains on the ocean
shore -- may differ in their constitution along the line of their planes
of existence, as the soul-substance differs from its vehicle, the body.
Each atom has seven planes of being or existence, we are taught; and
each plane is governed by its specific laws of evolution and absorption.
Ignorant of any, even approximate, chronological data from which to
start in attempting to decide the age of our planet or the origin of the
solar system, astronomers, geologists, and physicists are drifting with
each new hypothesis farther and farther away from the shores of fact
into the fathomless depths of speculative ontology.\* The Law of Analogy
in the plan of structure between the trans-Solar systems and the
intra-Solar planets, does not necessarily bear upon the finite
conditions to which every visible body is subject, in this our plane of
being. In Occult Science this law is the first and most important key to
Cosmic physics; but it has to be studied in its minutest details and,

Laplace, was chiefly based on the above fact that all the planets
revolved in the same direction. It is on this fact, mathematically
demonstrated during the time of Laplace, that this great astronomer,
calculating on the theory of probabilities, offered to bet three
milliards to one that the next planet discovered would have in its
system the same peculiarity of motion Eastward. The immutable laws of
scientific mathematics got "worsted by further experiments and
observations," it was said. This idea of Laplace's mistake prevails
generally to this day; but some astronomers have finally succeeded in
demonstrating (?) that the mistake had been in accepting Laplace's
assertion for a mistake; and steps to correct it without attracting
general attention to the bevue are now being taken. Many such unpleasant
surprises are in store for hypotheses of even a purely physical
character. What further disillusions, then, may there not be in
questions of a transcendental, Occult Nature? At any rate, Occultism
teaches that the so-called "reverse rotation" is a fact.

\* The Occultists, having most perfect faith in their own exact records,
astronomical and mathematical, calculate the age of Humanity, and assert
that the latter (as separate sexes) has existed in this Round just
18,618,727 years, as the Brahmanical teachings and even some Hindu
calendars declare.

turned seven times," before one comes to understand it. Occult
philosophy is the only science that can teach it. How, then, can anyone
hang the truth or the untruth of the Occultist's proposition that "the
Kosmos is eternal in its unconditioned collectivity, and finite but in
its conditioned manifestations" on this one-sided physical enunciation
that "it is a necessity of Nature to run down?"

With these verses -- the 4th Sloka of Stanza VI. -- ends that portion of
the Stanzas which relates to the Universal Cosmogony after the last
Mahapralaya or Universal destruction, which, when it comes, sweeps out
of Space every differentiated thing, Gods as atoms, like so many dry
leaves. From this verse onwards, the Stanzas are concerned only with our
Solar System in general, with the planetary chains therein,
inferentially, and with the history of our globe (the 4th and its chain)
especially. All the Stanzas and verses which follow in this Book I.
refer only to the evolution of, and on, our Earth. With regard to the
latter, a strange tenet -- strange from the modern scientific
stand-point only, of course -- is held, which ought to be made known.

But before entirely new and rather startling theories are presented to
the reader, they must be prefaced by a few words of explanation. This is
absolutely necessary, as these theories clash not only with modern
science, but contradict, on certain points, earlier statements made by
other Theosophists, who claim to base their explanations and renderings
of these teachings on the same authority as we do.\*

This may give rise to the idea that there is a decided contradiction
between the expounders of the same doctrine; whereas the difference, in
reality, arises from the incompleteness of the information given to
earlier writers, who thus drew some erroneous conclusions and indulged
in premature speculations, in their endeavour to present a complete
system to the public. Thus the reader, who is already a student of
Theosophy, must not be surprised to find in these pages the
rectification of certain statements made in various Theosophical works,
and also the explanation of certain points which have remained obscure,
because they were necessarily left incomplete. Many are the questions
upon which even the author of "Esoteric Buddhism" (the best and

most accurate of all such works) has not touched. On the other hand,
even he has introduced several mistaken notions which must now be
presented in their true mystic light, as far as the present writer is
capable of doing so.

Let us then make a short break between the Slokas just explained and
those which follow, for the Cosmic periods which separate them are of
immense duration. This will afford us ample time to take a bird's eye
view of some points pertaining to the Secret Doctrine, which have been
presented to the public under a more or less uncertain and sometimes
mistaken light.
