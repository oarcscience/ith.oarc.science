<H4>VII.<BR>
AN ATTACK ON THE SCIENTIFIC THEORY OF FORCE<BR>
BY A MAN OF SCIENCE.</H4>

<P>
<STRONG>T</STRONG>HE wise words of several (English) men of Science
have now to be quoted in our favour. Ostracised for &quot;principle's
sake&quot; by the few, they are tacitly approved of by the many.
That one of them preaches almost Occult doctrines, in some things
identical with, and often amounting to a public recognition of
our &quot;<EM>Fohat </EM>and his seven Sons&quot; --<HR>

<P>
the Occult <EM>Gandharva </EM>of the Vedas -- will be recognised
by every Occultist, and even by some profane readers.
<P>
If the latter open Volume V. of the <EM>Popular Science Review
</EM>(pp. 329-334), they will find in it an article on &quot;<EM>Sun
Force and Earth Force</EM>,&quot;<EM> </EM>by<EM> </EM>Dr. B.
W. Richardson, <B>F.R.S.</B>, which reads as follows: --
<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;At this moment, when the theory of mere motion as the origin
of all varieties of force is again becoming the prevailing thought,
it were almost heresy to re-open a debate, which for a period
appears, by general consent, to be virtually closed; but I accept
the risk, and shall state, therefore, what were the precise views
of the immortal heretic, whose name I have whispered to the readers,
(Samuel Metcalfe), respecting Sun Force. Starting with the argument
on which nearly all physicists are agreed, that there exist in
nature two agencies -- matter which is ponderable, visible, and
tangible, and a something which is imponderable, invisible, and
appreciable only by its influence on matter -- Metcalfe maintains
that the imponderable and active agency which he calls '<I>caloric</I>'<I>
</I>is<I> not a mere form of motion</I>,<I> </I>not a vibration
amongst the particles of ponderable matter, but <I>itself a material
substance flowing from the Sun </I>through Space,* filling the
voids between the particles of solid bodies, and conveying by
sensation the property called heat. The nature of caloric, or
Sun-Force, is contended for by him on the following grounds: --
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;(i.) That it may be added to, and abstracted from other
bodies and measured with mathematical precision.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;(ii.) That it augments the volume of bodies, which are again
reduced in size by its abstraction.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;(iii.) That it modifies the forms, properties, and conditions
of all other bodies.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;(iv.) That <I>it passes by radiation through the most perfect
vacuum</I>**<I> </I>that can be formed, in which it produces the
same effects on the thermometer as in the atmosphere.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;(v.) That it exerts mechanical and chemical forces which
nothing can restrain, as in volcanoes, the explosion of gunpowder,
and other fulminating compounds.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;(vi.) That it operates in a sensible manner on the nervous
system, producing intense pain; and when in excess, disorganization
of the tissues.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;As against the vibratory theory, Metcalfe further argues
that if caloric were a <I>mere property or quality</I>,<I> </I>it
could not augment the volume of other bodies; for this purpose
it must itself have volume, it must occupy space, and it must,
therefore, be a material agent. If caloric were <I>only the effect
of vibratory motion </I>amongst the particles of ponderable matter,
<I>it could not radiate from hot bodies </I>without the simultaneous
transition of the vibrating particles; but the fact stands out
that heat can radiate from material ponderable substance without

* Not only &quot;through space,&quot; but filling every point
of our solar system, for it is the physical residue, so to say,
of Ether, its <EM>lining </EM>on our plane; Ether having to serve
other cosmic and terrestrial purposes besides being the &quot;<EM>agent</EM>&quot;<EM>
</EM>for transmitting light. It is the astral fluid or &quot;Light&quot;
of the Kabalists, and the &quot;Seven rays&quot; of Sun-Vishnu.
<P>
** What need, then, of etheric waves for the transmission of light,
heat, etc., if <EM>this </EM>substance can pass through vacuum?

<H6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 525 DR. RICHARDSON'S HERESY.</H6>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
loss of weight of such substance. . . . With this view as to the
material nature of caloric or sun-force; with the impression firmly
fixed on his mind that 'everything in Nature is composed of two
descriptions of matter, the one essentially active and ethereal,
the other passive and motionless,'* Metcalfe based the hypothesis
that the Sun-force, or caloric, is a Self-active principle. For
its own particles, he holds, it has repulsion; for the particles
of all ponderable matter it has affinity; it attracts the particles
of ponderable matter with forces which vary inversely as the squares
of the distance. It thus acts <I>through </I>ponderable matter.
If universal space were filled with caloric, sun-force, alone
(without ponderable matter), caloric would also be inactive and
would constitute a boundless Ocean of powerless or quiescent ether,
because it would then have nothing on which to act, while ponderable
matter, however inactive of itself, has 'certain properties by
which it modifies and controls the actions of caloric, both of
which are governed by immutable laws that have their origin in
the mutual relations and specific properties of each.'
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;And he lays down a law which he believes is absolute, and
which is thus expressed: --
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot; 'By the attraction of caloric for ponderable matter, it
unites and holds together all things; by its self-repulsive energy
it separates and expands all things.' &quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
This, of course, is almost the occult explanation of cohesion.
Dr. Richardson continues: --
<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;As I have already said, <I>the tendency of modern teaching
is to rest upon the hypothesis </I>. . . <I>that heat is motion</I>,<I>
</I>or, as it would, perhaps, be better stated, a specific force
or form of motion.**
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;But this hypothesis, popular as it is, is not one that ought
to be accepted to the exclusion of the simpler views of the material
nature of sun-force, and of its influence in modifying the conditions
of matter. <I>We do not yet know sufficient to be dogmatic.</I>&quot;<I>***</I>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
. . . &quot;The hypothesis of Metcalfe respecting sun-force and
earth-force is not only very simple, but most fascinating. . .
. Here are two elements in the Universe, the one is ponderable
matter . . . The second element is the all-pervading Ether, solar-fire.
It is <I>without weight</I>,<I> substance</I>,<I> form</I>,<I>
or colour; it is matter infinitely divisible</I>,<I> </I>and its
particles repel each other; its rarity
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
</H6>

<P>
* And how can it be otherwise? Gross <EM>ponderable </EM>matter
is the body, the Shell of matter or Substance, the female passive
principle; and this <EM>Fohatic </EM>force is the second principle,
<EM>prana</EM> -- the male and the active? On our globe this Substance
is the second principle of the septenary <EM>Element</EM> -- Earth;
in the atmosphere, it is that of <EM>air</EM>, which is the cosmic
gross body; in the Sun it becomes the <EM>Solar body </EM>and
that of the Seven rays; in sidereal space it corresponds with
another principle, and so on. The whole is a homogeneous Unity
alone, the parts are all differentiations.
<P>
** Or the reverberation, and for sound, repercussion <EM>on our
plane </EM>of that which is a perpetual motion of that <EM>Substance
</EM>on higher planes. Our world and senses <EM>are</EM> victims
of <EM>Maya</EM>,<EM> </EM>ceaselessly.
<P>
*** An honest admission, that.<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 526 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</H6>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
is such that we have no word, except ether,* by which to express
it. It pervades and fills space, but alone it too is quiescent
-- dead.** We bring together the two elements, the inert matter,
the self-repulsive Ether (?) and thereupon dead (?) ponderable
matter is vivified&quot;; [<I>Ponderable matter may be inert but
never dead</I> --<I> this is Occult Law.</I> --<I> </I>H.P.B.]
. . . &quot;through the particles of the ponderable substance
the ether [<I>Ether</I>'<I>s second principle. </I>--<I> </I>H.P.B.]
penetrates, and, so penetrating, it combines with the ponderable
particles and holds them in mass, holds them together in bond
of union; they are dissolved in the Ether.&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;This distribution of solid ponderable matter through ether
extends, according to the theory before us, to everything that
exists at this moment. The ether is all-pervading. The human body
itself is charged with the ether [<I>Say</I> <I>astral light.
</I>--<I> </I>H.P.B.]; its minute particles are held together
by it; the plant is in the same condition; the most solid earth,
rock, adamant, crystal, metal, all are the same. But there are
differences in the capacities of different kinds of ponderable
matter to receive sun-force, and upon this depends the various
changing conditions of matter; the solid, the liquid, the gaseous
condition. Solid bodies have attracted caloric in excess over
fluid bodies, and hence their firm<I> cohesion; </I>when a portion
of molten zinc is poured upon a plate of solid zinc, the molten
zinc becomes as solid because there is a rush of caloric from
the liquid to the solid, and in the equalization the particles,
previously loose or liquid, are more closely brought together.
. . . Metcalfe himself, dwelling on the above-named phenomena,
and accounting for them by the unity of principle of action, which
has already been explained, sums up his argument in very clear
terms, in a comment on the densities of various bodies. 'Hardness
and softness' (he says), 'solidity and liquidity, are not essential
conditions of bodies, but depend on the relative proportions of
ethereal and ponderable matter of which they are composed. The
most elastic gas may be reduced to the liquid form by the abstraction
of caloric, and again converted into a firm solid, the particles
of which would cling together with a force proportional to their
augmented affinity for caloric. On the other hand, by adding a
sufficient quantity of the same principle to the densest metals,
their attraction for it is diminished when they are expanded into
the gaseous state, and their cohesion is destroyed.' &quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Having thus quoted at length the <EM>heterodox </EM>views of the
great &quot;heretic&quot; -- views that need only a little alteration
of terms here and there, the same eminent scientist -- an original
and liberal thinker, undeniably -- proceeds to sum up those views,
and continues: --
<H6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
</H6>

<P>
* Yet it is not <EM>Ether</EM>,<EM> </EM>but only one of the principles
of Ether, the latter being itself <EM>one of the principles of
Akasa.</EM> 
<P>
** And so does <EM>prana</EM> (Jiva) pervade the whole living
body of man; but alone, without having an atom to act upon, it
would be <EM>quiescent </EM>--<EM> </EM>dead; <EM>i.e.</EM>, would
be in <EM>laya</EM>, or as Mr. Crookes has it, &quot;locked in
<EM>protyle</EM>.&quot; It is the action of <EM>Fohat </EM>upon
a compound or even a simple body that produces life. When a body
dies it passes into the same polarity as its male energy and repels
therefore the active agent, which, losing hold of the <EM>whole</EM>,
fastens on the parts or molecules, this action being called chemical.
Vishnu, the Preserver, transforms himself into Rudra-Siva, the
Destroyer -- a correlation seemingly unknown to Science.<HR>

<H6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 527 WE DISAGREE.</H6>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;I shall not dwell at great length on this unity of sun-force
and earth, which this theory implies. But I may add that out of
it, or out of the hypothesis of mere motion as force, and of virtue
without substance, we may gather, as the nearest possible approach
to the truth on this, the most complex and profound of all subjects,
the following inferences: --
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;(<I>a</I>) Space, inter-stellary, inter-planetary, inter-material,
inter-organic, is not a vacuum, but is filled with a subtle fluid
or gas, which for want of a better term* we may still call, as
the ancients did, <I>Aith</I>-<I>ur </I>--<I> </I>Solar fire,
<STRONG>AE</STRONG>THER. This fluid, unchangeable in composition,
indestructible, invisible,** pervades everything and all [<I>ponderable.
</I>--<I> </I>H. P. B.] matter,*** the pebble in the running brook,
the tree overhanging, the man looking on, is charged with the
ether in various degree; the pebble less than the tree, the tree
less than man. All in the planet is in like manner so charged!
A world is built up in ethereal fluid, and moving through a sea
of it.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;(<I>b</I>) The Ether, whatever its nature is, is from the
sun and from the suns**** the suns are the generators of it, the
store-houses of it, the diffusers of it.*****
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;(<I>c</I>.) Without the ether there could be no motion;
without it particles of ponderable matter could not glide over
each other; without it there could be no impulse to excite those
particles into action.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;(<I>d</I>.) Ether determines the constitution of bodies.
Were there no ether there could be no change of constitution in
substance; water, for instance, could only exist as a substance,
compact and insoluble beyond any conception we could form of it.
It could never even be ice, never flint, never vapour, except
for ether.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;(<I>e</I>.) Ether connects sun with planet, planet with
planet, man with planet, man with man. Without ether there could
be no communication in the Universe; no light, no heat, no phenomenon
of motion.&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Thus we find that Ether and <EM>elastic </EM>atoms are, in the
alleged <EM>mechanical </EM>conception of the Universe, the Spirit
and Soul of Kosmos, and that the theory -- put it any way and
under whatever disguise -- always leaves a more widely opened
issue for men of
<H6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
</H6>

<P>
* Verily, unless the occult terms of the Kabalists are adopted!
<P>
** &quot;Unchangeable&quot; only during Manvantaric periods, after
which it merges once more into Mulaprakriti; &quot;invisible&quot;
for ever, in its own essence, but seen in its reflected coruscations,
called the Astral light by the modern Kabalists. Yet, conscious
and grand Beings clothed in that same Essence move in it.
<P>
*** One has to add (ponderable), to distinguish it from that <EM>Ether</EM>
which is matter still, though a substratum.
<P>
**** The Occult Sciences reverse the statement, and say that it
is the sun, and all the suns that are from <EM>it</EM>, which
emanate at the Manvantaric dawn from the <EM>Central Sun.</EM>

<P>
***** Here, we decidedly beg to differ with the learned gentleman.
Let us remember that this AEther, whether <EM>Akasa </EM>is meant
by the term, or its lower principle, Ether -- is septenary. <EM>Akasa
</EM>is Aditi in the allegory, and the mother of Marttanda (the
sun), the <EM>Deva</EM>-<EM>matri </EM>-- &quot;Mother of the
gods.&quot; In the solar system, the sun is her Buddhi and <EM>Vahan</EM>,<EM>
</EM>the Vehicle, hence the 6th principle; in Kosmos all the suns
are the Kama rupa of Akasa and so is ours. It is only when regarded
as an individual Entity in his own Kingdom that Surya (the sun)
is the 7th principle of the great body of <EM>matter</EM>.<HR>

<P>
Science to speculate beyond the line drawn by modern materialism
-- or call it <EM>agnosticism </EM>rather, to be more correct*
-- than the majority avails itself of. Atoms, Ether, or both,
modern speculation cannot get out of the circle of ancient thought;
and the latter was soaked through with archaic occultism. Undulatory
or corpuscular theory -- it is all one. It is speculation from
the aspects of phenomena, not from the knowledge of the essential
nature of the <EM>cause </EM>and<EM> causes. </EM>When modern
Science has explained to its audience the late achievements of
Bunsen and Kirchoff, and shown the seven colours, the &quot;primary&quot;
of a ray which is decomposed in a fixed order on a screen; and
described the respective lengths of luminous waves, what has it
proved? It has justified its reputation for <EM>exactness </EM>in
mathematical achievement by measuring even the length of a luminous
wave -- &quot;varying from about seven hundred and sixty millionths
of a millimetre at the red end of the spectrum to about three
hundred and ninety-three millionths of a millimetre at the violet
end.&quot; But when the exactness of the calculation with regard
to the <EM>effect </EM>on the light-wave is thus vindicated, Science
is forced to admit that the <EM>force </EM>(which is the <EM>supposed
cause</EM>)<EM> </EM>is<EM> believed </EM>to produce &quot;inconceivably
minute undulations&quot; in <EM>some </EM>medium -- &quot;<EM>generally
regarded as identical with the ethereal medium</EM>&quot;** --<EM>
</EM>and that medium itself is still only -- a &quot;<EM>hypothetical
</EM>agent!&quot;
<P>
Auguste Comte's pessimism with respect to the impossibility of
knowing some day the chemical composition of the sun, has not
been belied thirty years later by Kirchoff, as claimed. The spectroscope
has helped us to see that the elements, with which the modern
chemist is familiar, <EM>must in all probability </EM>be present
in the sun's outward robes -- <EM>not in the sun itself; </EM>and,
taking these &quot;robes,&quot; the solar cosmic veil, for the
sun itself, the physicists have declared its luminosity to be
due to <EM>combustion </EM>and <EM>flame</EM>,<EM> </EM>and have
mistaken the vital principle of that luminary for a purely <EM>material
</EM>thing, and called it &quot;chromosphere.&quot;*** We have
hypotheses and theories only so far, not law -- by any means.
<H6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
</H6>

<P>
* Brutal but frank materialism is more honest than Janus-faced
agnosticism in our days. <EM>Monism </EM>is the Pecksniff of modern
philosophy, turning a pharisaical face to psychology and idealism,
and its natural face of a Roman Augur, swelling his cheek with
his tongue -- to Materialism. The Monists are worse than the Materialists;
because, while looking at the Universe and psycho-spiritual man
from the same negative stand-point, the latter put their case
far less plausibly than sceptics of Mr. Tyndall's or even Mr.
Huxley's stamp. Herbert Spencer, Bain and Lewes are more dangerous
to universal truths than Buchner.
