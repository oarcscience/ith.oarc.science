### What the Lost Atlantis Is Supposed to Have Been

A GREAT island in the Atlantic opposite the Mediterranean; the remnant
of a mighty continent which once reached from the west coast of Africa
and Europe to the shores of Central America. The ancient world had a
clear tradition of it.

It was utterly destroyed in a day and a nigh by cataclysmic volcanic
outbursts and sank beneath the sea with all except a few of its millions
of inhabitants.

It was the region where mankind first rose from barbarism to a
civilization more advanced than that of ours today.

It became in the course of hundreds of thousands of years a
world-conquering nation. It colonized Egypt, the west coast of Africa
and Europe, Central America, the shores of the Gulf of Mexico, the
Mississippi Valley, the Pacific Coast of South America, the
Mediterranean, the Baltic, the Black Sea and the Caspian. It was the
cradle of civilization, and the civilization of the ancient world and
our civilization today are direct shoots of the Atlantic culture.

The racial memory of Atlantis is found in the legends of the Garden of
Eden of the Bible, the Garden of the Hesperides of the Greeks, the
Asgard of the Scandinavians, the Tir n'Og of the Celts and in all the
legends of a wonderful, mysterious land in which dwelt gods or godlike
mortals.

The stories of the Deluge, versions of which are found in the traditions
of almost every ancient and modern race, are simply the memory of the
stupendous catastrophe which wiped out Atlantis, the tale of which was
carried by those who escaped to all the lost land's colonies--and these
represented all the civilization of the world at that time.

In the same way the escape of some of the Atlanteans over a narrow land
bridge, which connected Atlantis with what is now Brittany, survives in
the legends of the Rainbow Bridge Perilous with the razor edge which the
Scandinavians believed was the only road to Asgard, the dwelling place
of the gods, in the famous Hell's Causway of the religious books of the
Middle Ages and in similar legends of the Hindoos, the Mayans and the
Turanians.

The gods and goddesses of the ancient Greeks, the Phoenicians, Hindoos
and Scandinavians were simply the Kings, Queens and heroes of Atlantis,
and the acts attributed to them in mythology are a confused recollection
of real historical events.

The religions of Egypt, Peru and that of the Mayans, the vanished race
that built the buried cities of Central America, and upon the wrecks of
whose civilization the Aztecs built their empire, were the original
religion of Atlantis.

The oldest colony formed by Atlantis was Egypt, whose civilization was a
provincial reproduction of that of the mother country. The next oldest
were those of Peru and Central America.

The Phoenician alphabet, parent of all the European alphabets, was
derived from and Atlantis alphabet, which was also conveyed from
Atlantis to the Mayans. The symbols and hieroglyphics of both Egypt and
the Mayans came from the same source, and so is explained their
similarity, to great to be accidental.

Atlantis was the original site of the Indo-European family of nations,
as well as the Semitic and possibly the Turanian.

The Atlanteans had full knowledge of electricity, steam and other
natural forces. They had also aeroplanes, power ships and explosives.
They were prodigious engineers and the first workers of iron. They used
gold and silver and a vanished precious metal known as orichalcum in
enormous quantities for ornamentation.
