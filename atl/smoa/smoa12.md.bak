### CHAPTER X

*The navy of Atlantis. Minerals of the island and theories regarding
them held by the mineralogists of that day and country*.

The boat which bore the fishermen and maids unto the isle which smiled
from out the sea was model for still others, builded slow for want of
"adz" or tool to shape with grace the rounded contour of the
cypress-built and steel-bound bark, which was the first attempt at ship
for commerce or yet ship for war which long after followed.

"Steel," question ye? Aye, steel I think ye name the shining blade, the
slab of metal welded to the hull, and thus had they this broadened band
of "steel," that metal whose method of construction long was lost to
science, industries, but was regained again, when centuries had flown by
metal workers, "experts" in this thy land.

"Steel" known to Atlantians first as spoil from out the ocean, from
galley vast that drifted smitten, storm-tossed. Rent in twain on reef
which led to death all boats that through dire misfortune sought to make
a landing on the northern shore. A reef whose stony teeth set fast in
many a gallant ship.

A reef which still shoots upwards ’neath the waves, imperilling many a
bark unto this day, so mountainous its bulk. And far in shore the rock
did set, though hid by giant trees which once invited storm-tossed
mariners a-starve for fruits and gurgling springs which forests deep
enfolded.

The captain, a builder of the supple oar, a cook

<span id="page_74">p. 74</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (and tyrant in his
line was he) were cast ashore with one great galley's hulk and fell a
prey to importuning of the kindly ones that peopled old Atlantis in its
dawn as home of nation.

His a matchless mind, the captain's. Yielding knowledge not, but
bartering for the leadership of fleet, if so ’twere builded by direction
of his men who brought strong vessels for the journeys to far shores.
And this was granted, but they did beswear him solemnly that of their
race henceforth he would become on of the sons of their fair isle.

That there his dust should lie, did not the hungry sea, which cryeth for
such fare, grasp ere he died with head in lap of slave, or wife who
loved and mourned him, raised him high shaft of alabaster o’er the
carven chest which held his ashes. Such the custom there.

And he, the foster child of that young nation, grew a man of might. The
rudely fashioned craft first made was soon supplanted by the graceful
barque that hands, grown skilful, through a tutoring brain, wrought
wondrously. A barque whose sides bore gleaming gold with name inscribed
and flowers carven, or yet a scene from nature drawn, of bird or
graceful leopard.

Tusked creatures, too, shone forth in gold upon the well-spiked sides of
galleys of the nobles of the state, as building of great barques
progressed.

Yet through the years that first crude barque, part fashioned from the
galley of the castaways, part from the fisher boat, held well its
place—a boat of peace, which carried envoys to the darker land far up
the sea, or yet to smiling islands set in southern seas; for stranger
spices and such condiments as old Atlantis knew not till at last one, so
skilled in foreign mixtures that his fame was great,

<span id="page_75">p. 75</span>

came, well pleased to bide upon the island whose fame reached far.

And as the minds of men reached out to grasp the laws of other
countries—other planets, a fleet was builded in whose strength and grace
combined the cleverness of nations' round. Each boat a wonder for its
strength and speed. Each boat, a marvel for its decoration, vied with
other barques in richness.

Flashing gems indeed were set about the crown of some fair sea-nymph,
graved in gold or metal that doth linger ’neath the waves yet rusts not,
nor is marred by beating waves nor play of monsters. Slaves who plied
great oars or stood by messengers of murderous mood were once of foreign
galley, mayhap, bent on slaughter: or were criminals who, not condemned
to death, might linger in the service of their king—their nation.

Pinned were they to seat by chains in early day and thus were given time
to ponder of their deeds. The captain of the fleet, ye call—a fleet
which challenged sun-rays shot with gold, which cast its sheen for miles
over quiet sea, or fought the waves as valiantly as tiger meets its
foe—the captain of this royal fleet was Wanandred—captain of the hosts
of sea. The meaning of the name? "Atlantian not by birth, but of the
galley broke upon the reef."

He came from far—from where pale faces met the pallid sun, the cold of
icebergs. Skin-clad people, brave but cruel; knowing naught of guile but
much of patience. Skilful with the oar, the spear, the mattock; not in
arts nor crafts as southern nations. In that early day so wise the
scattered people of the South they seemed to mock at God's creation, so
complete the work turned from their hands.

Their brains seemed set to springs of Nature holden in the Hand that
fashioned so completely

<span id="page_76">p. 76</span>

that in time we gaze on growth, on color—on the changes wrought by
atmosphere—on wave—play—toss of tide—almost on Time which creeps upon
us! leaves us! on the clouds. On all that cometh from the One who doth
create.

And those swart men did emulate so well the ether strong was chained to
build and bring from far some message light or stern as one dictated.
Men, were they, who past and left but meager trace; so meager that the
world today turns coldly from such page as I have here embellished with
this history and speak: "He doth pervert!"

Those galleys of Atlantis? Eighty feet the longest galley set to war.
The wood of cypress, tulip; harder yet a stuff was made from fiber mixed
with gum and shaped at will in giant mould of ribbed wood. Thongs, made
from the creepers of the jungle, serpent skin and sinews of the bear,
borne far with skins from Northern lands, were aids to make the galley
strong. Those boats of gum and fiber of the palm were light—were
strong—and to the salted water of the sea impervious; but the sweet lake
or river pierced with damp and failed to hold to shape the pulpy mass
which useless grew.

Each galley held its men in shackles in that early day, and no fierce
revolt—no captain smitten by rebellious crew. Yet kindness reigned
withal, and kings bestowed some token of their favor upon all on feast
days—days when vast pavilions built were named and blessed and the fleet
received a store of things deemed needful in that olden time of which ye
dream today.

The crew of each wore costume made at fancy of the captain-galley's
lord, who yet dared show no unkind mood to men that stern misfortune
bound. And smote he one in anger, unprovoked, a punishment was meted out
severely by the senate, by the

<span id="page_77">p. 77</span>

king, and in disgrace he sat and plied the oar, where once he reigned
supreme, for days ye count one hundred.

If boat were named the "Vulture," of that early fleet (a name ye would
not comprehend if it were spoken in the olden tongue) yet that same bird
of foul portent, which drew its life from Nature's gifts and lived as
now abhorred by men—if "vulture" were the name, the captain bravely
decked, wore golden helm beat into shape of bird of carrion on his brow,
and round each naked waist of toiling slave was wound a scarf
embroidered with the symbol foul.

When storms beat on the casque, or cloak which wrapped each form, the
crimsoned bird was stamped full plain. The prow showed boldly giant bird
of prey.

The leopard, tiger, or yet lily, so at variance in its beauty pure to
fiercer symbols, were the names employed. And all was writ so plain in
symbols that the foeman read, and reading, shuddered as the fleet drew
nigh; a menace to the "pirate," joy to them who loved Atlantis, gloried
in her strength, her arts.

One barque that made the fleet to nations by the sea a horror was the
funeral barge, begirt with ghastly trophies of the passed and valiant
warriors. Set with staves, red-painted, golden streamers broidered with
white urns fell languidly or fierce upon the breeze. In the cage upon
the tower sat the great and skilled embalmer. None so brave he be might
sully sea with corpse or feed the foul, fierce creatures of the deep,
Atlantis willed.

Her sons were hers indeed, and on her breast must rest their ashes when
the soul had fled. Thus to the shore they bore them, to great piles, the
pyres that lit the night when Moon was dark and low

<span id="page_78">p. 78</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Orion; and melted
husk of them who fell in warfare. Slave or king, in death they equal
shared the pomp and were the pride of people who as kin regarded every
soul born on Atlantis’ shores.

When homeward bent, the galleys bearing dead did creep at rear of fleet.
Low chanting smote the ears of warriors on the barques. A song of peace
fell low. Soft sounds of sweet-toned instruments arose and split the
curtain of the night or met the glancing sunbeams. Smote the strains
fond ears all strained to catch a whispered word of love. Smote ears
that drunk, but now, alas! would drink no more the voice of him beloved.

Great bands of priests whose white robes showed the mark that boded
ill—the fleshless bones as form of man portrayed—walked slowly to the
massive quays and greeted all with blessings; raised voice in murmured
chants and promised good to souls that left their husk at call of duty,
country's need, and passed each token of the men who died, to weeping
sire, or son, or yet a friend. And in their chambers dark the women
mourned.

The instruments for war were barbed missiles, shot from prow, from
stern, from sides through missile-thrower simple, not complex. A wheel,
a [pulley](errata.htm#3.md), piles of seeming toys which opened jaws and
crushed the bone or entered body with their barbed fangs. The spear
three sided. The stave, the axe with biting blade, and fiery baubles
peering from the box which gathered force from out the atmosphere, were
later hung on every prow. And thus held war or struggle to maintain
their right to merchandise.

In time of peace sweet strains the waves caressed and even slaves sang
gaily, keeping time to rhythm of their blades; and garlands from fair
hands were cast in showers when galley sailed afar. The banner

<span id="page_79">p. 79</span>

of each boat showed name in symbol clear, or characters, and over every
name was set the god each worshipped. Thus each captain's god was borne
aloft; and as the sun shot up or sank beneath the water, seemingly, each
man of all the fleet did lift his voice and cry:

"We laud thee; God of all the gods who doth protect and hold in bonds of
safety us—and ours—our land, our captain and this noble barque." So
clearly rang across the water loud this cry when stars denoted midnight,
or great Orion swinging far in space, and in his language held the token
of a storm, or Venus dipped her golden head and Mars swung boldly into
sight.

And men upon the shore would shudder, or yet smile, according to their
policy or nation. Thus they spake: "The dogs do prowl from fierce
Atlantis’ shore!" Or thus: "We need protection, and it comes from dear
Atlantis—sister in our need." And never greater or a braver fleet had
borne the sun-light on its armoured sides since time began.

Yea, that navy of Atlantis was a fixed mark, from time when first they
builded from the wrecked boats, which grew to beauty as the years
advanced. The captains of the ships composing fleet were men of mark
whose fathers held the state to ancient laws. All, men of wealth and
minds superior were theirs.

Yea, the government advanced, or punished for an act of discipline
betrayed. A form of service study had the priests maintained. A man must
fit himself by deep attention to the navigation rules, and also laws
that govern planets high; and waves, which bore the impress of the
higher waters, held in check by state of active planetary movement
towards the zenith, bearing water held in check of ice or mist that
reaches far beyond the lower cloud

<span id="page_80">p. 80</span>

mass, only loosened by agitation of the poles, or of the planets
swirling far in space at certain periods.

Did the laws, so well contained in poise and in cohesion of the
molecules of congealed force, but come astray through laxity of ether or
electric band—which like a wall withholds one from its mate, the higher
from the lower—all the seas might rise, submerge the world, or, tipping
outwards, make world so dry that water force were known no more.

Thus learned they to so control all force which man is subject to, yet
knows not his subjection. Thus they held control of nations less endowed
with knowledge. War they sought not; but when thrust upon them they were
not afraid to seek and conquered every foe.
