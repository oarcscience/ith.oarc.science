### CHAPTER VIII

*Punishment by the priesthood for murder. Punishment of women for
children's death*.

Punishment for murder meant the tightening of a cord about the source of
life, and this mode have men of today learned through tradition and
through that stream of events which breaks seldom through the years.

To men grown old in crime the punishment became more lenient, for thus
the council argued: "The gods a punishment will mete which days, but
few, hold for this wreck of manhood, and thus no need have we to aid."
So he, the hardened criminal, was bound within a vault which led unto
the sea and there eked out a life of solitude, with naught save needed
meat and drink to break the hours' long sway.

None other entered the retreat of crime, but rats ran nimbly to and fro
and basked within the spot of sunlight which, perchance, lit up the
rock-hewn chamber when high noon was rung from throats of bells that cut
the air of rarest purity, so cleansed by breath of sea and atmosphere
all purged from dust by breezes born from waves.

And so it was that man met Maker face to face in thought—that gift of
joy or torture-weapon sharp as steel beat by the smith. Aye, thought!
That ripener of crime, of greed, of hate or yet of love and charity. The
growth of mind attuned to catch the motive chords asundered from the
body's mass of nerves and muscles. Mechanism subtle that doth breed the
all intangible, unknowable stream of harm,

<span id="page_65">p. 65</span>

or good, which, bred in brain leaps out to cast to death or raises
highest pinnacle of joy.

Such hath Thought been since first the skull of man did fit a mood that
grew beneath the cap old Nature made for mass ye call "the brain."

And when we speak of Nature, in our hearts the real source doth beat the
current strong of God—of All—of atoms—whirling specks and massive
products of a Mind alone. Of Law but never force of man, for man alone
can nothing make, but leans upon the vast, majestic Mind.

Yea, woman, too, so soft in love, so strong in hate, was punished for
that crime of taking life—the gift which man may take but ne’er return
again. Aye, God doth never yield again to husk when once the cord of
soul and husk is broke. A body dieth when the soul is free and never
more doth that take shape which once hath held a soul.

A woman nurtured tenderly was made to kneel on stones, protected from
the sun's fierce rays, and there for weeks ye number twelve each day did
kneel with arms upraised to gods. Her torture sometimes shortened by the
slave who stood with wand to beat the breath from casket frail if she
did falter in her pleadings long. And thus she met the soul sent out to
quench her hate.

And if perchance, her babe was reft of life while lying at her side in
slumber deep, no murder had she done, so she but sat beside the highway
wailing sore: "My child is dead!—is dead!" And this long "month of
tears" atoned for fault of oversleep, and such example made the care of
young a task so well performed that seldom thus they died.

If to an unwed maid a child was born, all undesired, and it died at her
hand, four stalwart slaves stripped from her form the gems, the cloth of
gold, mayhap, the fine-spun lace and from the shore in

<span id="page_66">p. 66</span>

barge sped out and cast her, shrieking, in the sea to fierce, finned
ghouls.

A father smitten by his son was soon avenged, for he (the son) was reft
of hands and eyes and then the strangler's cord did well the task of
ridding husk of soul so foul. A theft was punished by the thief
enstamped upon the shoulder with the character denoting theft, and he no
mantle was allowed to wear for years ye number four.

A maid who had despoiled her mistress wore a scarlet strap about her
brow to hide the mark supposed to stand upon the brow of them who
pilfered other people's substance. Wife murderer sat in galley all the
years that Time drew out for him till death; for he was thought to fit
his soul by meditation stern for other plane where (priest told well the
tale) great Ses did fix the cord about the neck of soul, enacting well
the executioner.

And thus did man take in his hands the task of God to punish for
despoiling page of life—the book unsullied first, but blotted sore with
stain of unfixed thoughts—of ill to fellow men.

The priesthood punished as was best thought fit, each member of the
order who did sin, the nation knowing naught of what befell "the
Temple's children." Each was taught the law, and if it were broken by an
act forbidden, the highest of the order spake the word of punishment and
punishment was given. No plea the order stayed.

Priority among the priests was known alone by age, not service nor yet
rank or wealth. The elder priests—the "fathers" called, in dying left
their power to next in age. All priests were taught the selfsame laws
and science whispered to each ear the same, and mentally they each so
strove to grasp, not one could say his wisdom was the less. Such were
not law.

to demean his sacred word.
