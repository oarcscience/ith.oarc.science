## CHAPTER V

### THE DELUGE LEGENDS OF AMERICA.

"IT is a very remarkable fact," says Alfred Maury, "that we find in
America traditions of the Deluge coming infinitely nearer to that of the
Bible and the Chaldean religion than among any people of the Old World.
It is difficult to suppose that the emigration that certainly took place
from Asia into North America by the Kourile and Aleutian Islands, and
still does so in our day, should have brought in these memories, since
no trace is found of them among those Mongol or Siberian populations
which were fused with the natives of the New World. . . . The attempts
that have been made to trace the origin of Mexican civilization to Asia
have not as vet led to any sufficiently conclusive facts. Besides, had
Buddhism, which we doubt, made its way into America, it could not have
introduced a myth not found in its own scriptures. The cause of these
similarities between the diluvian traditions of the nations of the New
World and that of the Bible remains therefore unexplained."

The cause of these similarities can be easily explained: the legends of
the Flood did not pass into America by way of the Aleutian Islands, or
through the Buddhists of Asia, but were derived from an actual knowledge
of Atlantis possessed by the people of America.

Atlantis and the western continent had from an immemorial age held
intercourse with each other: the great nations of America were simply
colonies from Atlantis, sharing in its civilization, language, religion,
and blood. From Mexico to the peninsula of Yucatan, from the shores of
Brazil to the heights of Bolivia and Peru, from the Gulf of Mexico to
the head-waters of the Mississippi River, the colonies of Atlantis

<span id="page_99">p. 99</span>

extended; and therefore it is not strange to find, as Alfred Maury says,
American traditions of the Deluge coming nearer to that of the Bible and
the Chaldean record than those of any people of the Old World.

"The most important among the American traditions are the Mexican, for
they appear to have been definitively fixed by symbolic and mnemonic
paintings before any contact with Europeans. According to these
documents, the Noah of the Mexican cataclysm was Coxcox, called by
certain peoples Teocipactli or Tezpi. He had saved himself, together
with his wife Xochiquetzal, in a bark, or, according to other
traditions, on a raft made of cypress-wood (*Cupressus disticha*).
Paintings retracing the deluge of Coxcox have been discovered among the
Aztecs, Miztecs, Zapotecs, Tlascaltecs, and Mechoacaneses. The tradition
of the latter is still more strikingly in conformity with the story as
we have it in Genesis, and in Chaldean sources. It tells how Tezpi
embarked in a spacious vessel with his wife, his children, and several
animals, and grain, whose preservation was essential to the subsistence
of the human race. When the great god Tezcatlipoca decreed that the
waters should retire, Tezpi sent a vulture from the bark. The bird,
feeding on the carcasses with which the earth was laden, did not return.
Tezpi sent out other birds, of which the humming-bird only came back
with a leafy branch in its beak. Then Tezpi, seeing that the country
began to vegetate, left his bark on the mountain of Colhuacan.

"The document, however, that gives the most valuable information," says
Lenormant, "as to the cosmogony of the Mexicans is one known as 'Codex
Vaticanus,' from the library where it is preserved. It consists of four
symbolic pictures, representing the four ages of the world preceding the
actual one. They were copied at Chobula from a manuscript anterior to
the conquest, and accompanied by the explanatory commentary of Pedro de
los Rios, a Dominican monk, who, in 1566, less than fifty years after
the arrival of Cortez, devoted himself to the research of indigenous
traditions as being necessary to his missionary work."

There were, according to this document, four ages of the world. The
first was an age of giants (the great mammalia?)

<span id="page_100">p. 100</span>

who were destroyed by famine; the second age ended in a conflagration;
the third age was an age of monkeys.

"Then comes the fourth age, *Atonatiuh*, 'Sun of Water,' whose number is
10 X 400 + 8, or 4008. It ends by a great inundation, a veritable
deluge. All mankind are changed into fish, with the exception of one man
and his wife, who save themselves in a bark made of the trunk of a
cypress-tree. The picture represents Matlalcueye, goddess of waters, and
consort of Tlaloc, god of rain, as darting down toward earth. Coxcox and
Xochiquetzal, the two human beings preserved, are seen seated on a
tree-trunk and floating in the midst of the waters. This flood is
represented as the last cataclysm that devastates the earth."

The learned Abbé Brasseur de Bourbourg translates from the Aztec
language of the "Codex Chimalpopoca" the following Flood legend:

"This is the sun called *Nahui-atl*, '4 water.' Now the water was
tranquil for forty years, plus twelve, and men lived for the third and
fourth times. When the sun *Nahui-atl* came there had passed away four
hundred years, plus two ages, plus seventy-six years. Then all mankind
was lost and drowned, and found themselves changed into fish. The sky
came nearer the water. In a single day all was lost, and the day
*Nahui-xochitl*, '4 flower,' destroyed all our flesh.

"And that year was that of *cé-calli*, '1 house,' and the day
*Nahui-atl* all was lost. Even the mountains *sunk into the water*, and
the water remained tranquil for fifty-two springs.

"Now at the end of the year the god Titlacahuan had warned Nata and his
spouse Nena, saying, 'Make no more wine of Agave, but begin to hollow
out a great cypress, and you will enter into it when in the month
Tozontli the water approaches the sky.'

"Then they entered in, and when the god had closed the door, he said,
'Thou shalt eat but one ear of maize, and thy wife one also.'

"But as soon as they had finished they went out, and the water remained
calm, for the wood no longer moved, and, on opening it, they began to
see fish.

<span id="page_101">p. 101</span>

"Then they lit a fire, by rubbing together pieces of wood, and they
roasted fish.

The gods Citlallinicué and Citlalatonac, instantly looking down said:
'Divine Lord, what is that fire that is making there? Why do they thus
smoke the sky?' At once Titlacahuan-Tezcatlipoca descended. He began to
chide, saying, 'Who has made this fire here?' And, seizing hold of the
fish, he shaped their loins and heads, and they were transformed into
dogs (*chichime*)."

Here we note a remarkable approximation to Plato's account of the
destruction of Atlantis. "In one day and one fatal night," says Plato,
"there came mighty earthquakes and inundations that ingulfed that
warlike people." "In a single day all was lost," says the Aztec legend.
And, instead of a rainfall of forty days and forty nights, as
represented in the Bible, here we see "in a single day. . . *even the
mountains sunk into the water*;" not only the land on which the people
dwelt who were turned into fish, but the very mountains of that land
sunk into the water. Does not this describe the fate of Atlantis? In the
Chaldean legend "the great goddess Ishtar wailed like a child," saying,
"I am the mother who gave birth to men, and, *like to the race of
fishes*, they are filling the sea."

In the account in Genesis, Noah "builded an altar unto the Lord, and
took of every clean beast, and of every clean fowl, and offered burnt
offerings on the altar. And the Lord smelled a sweet savor; and the Lord
said in his heart, 'I will not again curse the ground any more for man's
sake.'" In the Chaldean legend we are told that Khasisatra also offered
a sacrifice, a burnt offering, "and the gods assembled like flies above
the master of the sacrifice." But Bel came in a high state of
indignation, just as the Aztec god did, and was about to finish the work
of the Deluge, when the great god Ea took ''pity in his heart and
interfered to save the remnant of mankind.

These resemblances cannot be accidental; neither can they be the
interpolations of Christian missionaries, for it will be observed the
Aztec legends differ from the Bible in points

<span id="page_102">p. 102</span>

where they resemble on the one hand Plato's record, and on the other the
Chaldean legend.

The name of the hero of the Aztec story, *Nata*, pronounced with the
broad sound of the *a*, is not far from the name of Noah or Noe. The
Deluge of Genesis is a Phœnician, Semitic, or Hebraic legend, and yet,
strange to say, the name of Noah, which occurs in it, bears no
appropriate meaning in those tongues, but is derived from Aryan sources;
its fundamental root is *Na*, to which in all the Aryan language is
attached the meaning of water--νάειν, to flow; νᾶμα, water; Nympha,
Neptunus, water deities. (Lenormant and Chevallier, "Anc. Hist. of the
East," vol. i., p. 15.) We find the root *Na* repeated in the name of
this Central American Noah, *Na-ta*, and probably in the word
"*Na*-hui-atl"--the age of water.

But still more striking analogies exist between the Chaldean legend and
the story of the Deluge as told in the "Popul Vuh" (the Sacred Book) of
the Central Americans:

"Then the waters were agitated by the will of the Heart of Heaven
(Hurakan), and a great inundation came upon the heads of these
creatures. . . . They were ingulfed, and a resinous thickness descended
from heaven; . . . the face of the earth was obscured, and a heavy
darkening rain commenced-rain by day and rain by night. . . . There was
beard a great noise above their heads, as if produced by fire. Then were
men seen running, pushing each other, filled with despair; they wished
to climb upon their houses, and the houses, tumbling down, fell to the
ground; they wished to climb upon the trees, and the trees shook them
off; they wished to enter into the grottoes (eaves), and the grottoes
closed themselves before them. . . . Water and fire contributed to the
universal ruin at the time of the last great cataclysm which preceded
the fourth creation."

Observe the similarities here to the Chaldean legend. There is the same
graphic description of a terrible event. The "black cloud" is referred
to in both instances; also the dreadful noises. the rising water, the
earthquake rocking the trees, overthrowing the houses, and crushing even
the mountain caverns;

<span id="page_103">p. 103</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> "the men running
and pushing each other, filled with despair," says the "Popul Vuh;" "the
brother no longer saw his brother," says the Assyrian legend.

And here I may note that this word *hurakan*--the spirit of the abyss,
the god of storm, the hurricane--is very suggestive, and testifies to an
early intercourse between the opposite shores of the Atlantic. We find
in Spanish the word *huracan*; in Portuguese, *furacan*; in French,
*ouragan*; in German, Danish, and Swedish, *orcan*--all of them
signifying a storm; while in Latin *furo*, or *furio*, means to rage.
And are not the old Swedish *hurra*, to be driven along; our own word
hurried; the Icelandic word *hurra*, to be rattled over frozen ground,
all derived from the same root from which the god of the abyss, Hurakan,
obtained his name? The last thing a people forgets is the name of their
god; we retain to this day, in the names of the days of the week, the
designations of four Scandinavian gods and one Roman deity.

It seems to me certain the above are simply two versions of the same
event; that while ships from Atlantis carried terrified passengers to
tell the story of the dreadful catastrophe to the people of the
Mediterranean shores, other ships, flying from the tempest, bore similar
awful tidings to the civilized races around the Gulf of Mexico.

The native Mexican historian, Ixtlilxochitl, gave this as the Toltec
legend of the Flood:

"It is found in the histories of the Toltecs that this age and *first
world*, as they call it, lasted 1716 years; that men were destroyed by
tremendous rains and lightning from the sky, and even all the land,
without the exception of anything, and the highest mountains, were
covered up and submerged in water *fifteen cubits* (caxtolmolatli); and
here they added other fables of how men came to multiply from the few
who escaped from this destruction in a "toptlipetlocali;" that this word
nearly signifies a close chest; and how, after men had multiplied, they
erected a very high "zacuali," which is to-day a tower of great height,
in order to take refuge in it should the

<span id="page_104">p. 104</span>

second world (age) be destroyed. Presently their languages were
confused, and, not being able to understand each other, they went to
different parts of the earth.

"The Toltecs, consisting of seven friends, with their wives, who
understood the same language, came to these parts, having first passed
great land and seas, having lived in caves, and having endured great
hardships in order to reach this land; . . . they wandered 104 years
through different parts of the world before they reached Hue Hue
Tlapalan, which was in Ce Tecpatl, 520 years after the Flood."
("Ixtlilxochitl Relaciones," in Kingsborough's "Mex. Ant.," vol. ix.,
pp. 321, 322.)

It will of course be said that this account, in those particulars where
it agrees with the Bible, was derived from the teachings of the Spanish
priests; but it must be remembered that Ixtlilxochitl was an Indian, a
native of Tezeuco, a son of the queen, and that his "Relaciones" were
drawn from the archives of his family and the ancient writings of his
nation: he had no motive to falsify documents that were probably in the
hands of hundreds at that time.

Here we see that the depth of the water over the earth, "fifteen
cubits," given in the Toltec legend, is precisely the same as that named
in the Bible: "fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail." (Gen.,
chap. vii., 20.)

In the two curious picture-histories of the Aztecs preserved in the
Boturini collection, and published by Gamelli Careri

and others, there is a record of their migrations from their original
location through various parts of the North American continent until
their arrival in Mexico. In both cases their starting-point is an
*island*, from which they pass in a boat; and the island contains in one
case a mountain, and in the other a high temple in the midst thereof.
These things seem to be reminiscences of their origin in Atlantis.

In each case we see the crooked mountain of the Aztec legends, the
Calhuacan, looking not unlike the bent mountain of the monk, Cosmos.

In the legends of the Chibchas of Bogota we seem to have distinct
reminiscences of Atlantis. Bochica was their leading divinity. During
two thousand years he employed himself in elevating his subjects. He
lived in the sun, while his wife Chia occupied the moon. This would
appear to be an allusion to the worship of the sun and moon. Beneath
Bochica in their mythology was Chibchacum. In an angry mood he brought a
deluge on the people of the table-land. Bochica punished him for this
act, and obliged him ever after, like Atlas, to bear the burden of the
earth on his back. Occasionally be shifts the earth from one shoulder to
another, and this causes earthquakes!

Here we have allusions to an ancient people who, during thousands of
years, were elevated in the scale of civilization, and were destroyed by
a deluge; and with this is associated an Atlantean god bearing the world
on his back. We find even the rainbow appearing in connection with this
legend. When Bochica appeared in answer to prayer to quell the deluge he
is seated on a rainbow. He opened a breach in the earth at Tequendama,
through which the waters of the flood escaped, precisely as we have seen
them disappearing through the crevice in the earth near Bambyce, in
Greece.

The Toltecs traced their migrations back to a starting-point called
"Aztlan," or "Atlan." This could be no other than, Atlantis. (Bancroft's
"Native Races," vol. v., p. 221.) "The

<span id="page_106">p. 106</span>

original home of the Nahuatlacas was Aztlan, the location of which has
been the subject of much discussion. The causes that led to their exodus
from that country can only be conjectured; but they may be supposed to
have been driven out by their enemies, for Aztlan is described as a land
too fair and beautiful to be left willingly in the mere hope of finding
a better." (Bancroft's "Native Races," vol. v., p. .306.) The Aztecs
also claimed to have come originally from Aztlan. (*Ibid*., p. 321.)
Their very name, Aztecs, was derived from Aztlan. (*Ibid*., vol. ii., p.
125). They were Atlanteans.

The "Popul Vuh" tells us that after the migration from Aztlan three sons
of the King of the Quiches, upon the death of their father, "determined
to go as their fathers had ordered to the East, on the shores of the sea
whence their fathers had come, to receive the royalty, 'bidding adieu to
their brothers and friends, and promising to return.' Doubtless they
passed over the sea when they went to the East to receive the royalty.
Now this is the name of the lord, of the monarch of the people of the
East where they went. And when they arrived before the lord Nacxit, the
name of the great lord, the only judge, whose power was without limit,
behold he granted them the sign of royalty and all that represents it .
. . and the insignia of royalty . . . all the things, in fact, which
they brought on their return, and which they went to receive from the
other side of the sea--the art of painting from Tulan, a system of
writing, they said, *for the things recorded in their histories*."
(Bancroft's "Native Races," vol. v., p. 553 "Popul Vuh," p. 294.)

This legend not only points to the East as the place of origin of these
races, but also proves that this land of the East, this Aztlan, this
Atlantis, exercised dominion over the colonies in Central America, and
furnished them with the essentials of civilization. How completely does
this agree with the statement of Plato that the kings of Atlantis held
dominion over parts of "the great opposite continent!"

<span id="page_107">p. 107</span>

Professor Valentini ("Maya Archæol.," p. 23) describes an Aztec picture
in the work of Gemelli ("Il giro del mondo," vol. vi.) of the migration
of the Aztecs from Aztlan:

"Out of a sheet of water there projects the peak of a mountain; on it
stands a tree, and on the tree a bird spreads its wings. At the foot of
the mountain-peak there comes out of the water the heads of a man and a
woman. The one wears on his head the symbol of his name, *Coxcox*, a
pheasant. The other head bears that of a hand with a bouquet (*xochitl*,
a flower, and *quetzal*, shining in green gold). In the foreground is a
boat, out of which a naked man stretches out his hand imploringly to
heaven. Now turn to the sculpture in the Flood tablet (on the great
Calendar stone). There you will find represented the Flood, and with
great emphasis, by the accumulation of all those symbols with which the
ancient Mexicans conveyed the idea of water: a tub of standing water,
drops springing out--not two, as heretofore in the symbol for *Atl*,
water--but four drops; the picture for moisture, a snail; above, a
crocodile, the king of <span id="img_10700"></span>

the rivers. In the midst of these symbols you notice the profile of a
man with a fillet, and a smaller one of a woman. There can be doubt
these are the Mexican Noah, *Coxcox*, and his wife, *Xochiquetzal*; and
at the same time it is evident (the Calendar stone, we know, was made in
A.D., 1478) that the story of them, and the pictures representing the
story, have not been invented by the Catholic clergy, but really existed
among these nations long before the Conquest."

The above figure represents the Flood tablet on the great Calendar
stone.

When we turn to the uncivilized Indians of America, while we still find
legends referring to the Deluge, they are, with one exception, in such
garbled and uncouth forms that we can only see glimpses of the truth
shining through a mass of fable.

The following tradition was current among the Indians of the Great
Lakes:

<span id="page_108">p. 108</span>

"In former times the father of the Indian tribes dwelt *toward the
rising sun*. Having been warned in a dream that a deluge was coming upon
the earth, be built a raft, on which be saved himself, with his family
and all the animals. He floated thus for several months. The animals,
who at that time spoke, loudly complained and murmured against him. At
last a new earth appeared, on which he landed with all the animals, who
from that time lost the power of speech, as a punishment for their
murmurs against their deliverer."

According to Father Charlevoix, the tribes of Canada and the valley of
the Mississippi relate in their rude legends that all mankind was
destroyed by a flood, and that the Good Spirit, to repeople the earth,
had changed animals into men. It is to J. S. Kohl we owe our
acquaintance with the version of the Chippeways--full of grotesque and
perplexing touches--in which the man saved from the Deluge is called
Menaboshu. To know if the earth be drying, he sends a bird, the diver,
out of his bark; then becomes the restorer of the human race and the
founder of existing society.

A clergyman who visited the Indians north-west of the Ohio in 1764 met,
at a treaty, a party of Indians from the west of the Mississippi.

"They informed him that one of their most ancient traditions was that, a
great while ago, they had a common father, who lived toward the rising
of the sun, and governed the whole world; that all the white people's
heads were under his feet; that he had twelve sons, by whom he
administered the government; that the twelve sons behaved very bad, and
tyrannized over the people, abusing their power; that the Great Spirit,
being thus angry with them, suffered the white people to introduce
spirituous liquors among them, made them drunk, stole the special gift
of the Great Spirit from them, and by this means usurped power over
them; and ever since the Indians' heads were under the white people's
feet." (Boudinot's "Star in the West," p. 111.)

Here we note that they looked "toward the rising sun"--toward
Atlantis--for the original home of their race; that this

<span id="page_109">p. 109</span>

region governed "the whole world;" that it contained white people, who
were at first a subject race, but who subsequently rebelled, and
acquired dominion over the darker races. We will see reason hereafter to
conclude that Atlantis had a composite population, and that the
rebellion of the Titans in Greek mythology was the rising up of a
subject population.

In 1836 C. S. Rafinesque published in Philadelphia, Pa., a work called
"The American Nations," in which he gives the historical songs or chants
of the Lenni-Lenapi, or Delaware Indians, the tribe that originally
dwelt along, the Delaware River. After describing a time "when there was
nothing but sea-water on top of the land," and the creation of sun,
moon, stars, earth, and man, the legend depicts the Golden Age and the
Fall in these words: "All were willingly pleased, all were
easy-thinking, and all were well-happified. But after a while a
snake-priest, *Powako*, brings on earth secretly the snake-worship
(*Initako*) of the god of the snakes, *Wakon*. And there came
wickedness, crime, and unhappiness. And bad weather was coming,
distemper was coming, with death was coming. All this happened *very
long ago, at the first land, Netamaki*, beyond the great *ocean
Kitahikau*." Then follows the Song of the Flood:

"There was, long ago, a powerful snake, *Maskanako*, when the men had
become bad beings, *Makowini*. This strong snake had become the foe of
the Jins, and they became troubled, hating each other. Both were
fighting, both were, spoiling, both were never peaceful. And they were
fighting, least man *Mattapewi* with dead-keeper *Nihaulowit*. And the
strong snake readily resolved to destroy or fight the beings or the men.
The dark snake he brought, the monster (*Amanyam*) he brought,
snake-rushing water he brought (it). *Much water is rushing, much go to
hills, much penetrate, much destroying*. Meanwhile at *Tula* (this is
the same Tula referred to in the Central American legends), at THAT
ISLAND, Nana-Bush (the great hare Nana) becomes the ancestor of beings
and men. Being born creeping, he is ready to move and dwell at *Tula*.
The beings and men all go forth from the flood creeping in shallow water
or

<span id="page_110">p. 110</span>

swimming afloat, asking which is the way to the turtle-back, *Tula-pin*.
But there are many monsters in the way, and some men were devoured by
them. But the daughter of a spirit helped them in a boat, saying, 'Come,
come;' they were coming and were helped. The name of the boat or raft is
*Mokol*. . . . Water running off, it is drying; in the plains and the
mountains, at the path of the cave, elsewhere went the powerful action
or motion." Then follows Song 3, describing the condition of mankind
after the Flood. Like the Aryans, they moved into a cold country: "It
freezes was there; it snows was there; it is cold was there." They move
to a milder region to hunt cattle; they divided their forces into
tillers and hunters. "The good and the holy were the hunters;" they
spread themselves north, south, east, and west." Meantime all the snakes
were afraid in their huts, and the Snake-priest *Nakopowa* said to all,
'Let us go.' *Eastwardly* they go forth at Snakeland (*Akhokink*), and
they went away earnestly grieving." Afterward the fathers of the
Delawares, who "were always boating and navigating," find that the
Snake-people have taken possession of a fine country; and they collect
together the people from north, south, east, and west, and attempt "to
pass over the waters of the frozen sea to possess that land." They seem
to travel in the dark of an Arctic winter until they come to a gap of
open sea. They can go no farther; but some tarry at Firland, while the
rest return to where they started from, "the old turtle land."

Here we find that the land that was destroyed was the "first land;" that
it was an island "beyond the great ocean." In all early age the people
were happy and peaceful; they became wicked; "snake worship" was
introduced, and was associated, as in Genesis, with the "fall of man;"
Nana-Bush became the ancestor of the new race; his name reminds us of
the Toltec *Nata* and the Hebrew *Noah*. After the flood came a
dispersing of the people, and a separation into hunters and tillers of
the soil.

Among the Mandan Indians we not only find flood legends, but, more
remarkable still, we find an *image of the ark preserved* from
generation to generation, and a religious ceremony performed

<span id="page_111">p. 111</span>

which refers plainly to the destruction of Atlantis, and to the arrival
of one of those who escaped from the Flood, bringing the dreadful
tidings of the disaster. It must be remembered, as we will show
hereafter, that many of these Mandan Indians were white men, with hazel,
gray, and blue eyes, and all shades of color of the hair from black to
pure white; that they dwelt in houses in fortified towns, and
manufactured earthen-ware pots in which they could boil water--an art
unknown to the ordinary Indians, who boiled water by putting heated
stones into it.

I quote the very interesting account of George Catlin, who visited the
Mandans nearly fifty years ago, lately republished in London in the
"North American Indians," a very curious and valuable work. He says
(vol. i., p. 88):

"In the centre of the village is an open space, or public square, 150
feet in diameter and circular in form, which is used for all public
games and festivals, shows and exhibitions. The lodges around this open
space front in, with their doors toward. the centre; and in the middle
of this stands an object of great religious veneration, on account of
the importance it has in connection with the annual religious
ceremonies. This object is in the form of a large hogshead, some eight
or ten feet high, made of planks and hoops, containing within it some of
their choicest mysteries or medicines. They call it the 'Big Canoe.'"

This is a representation of the ark; the ancient Jews venerated a
similar image, and some of the ancient Greek States followed in
processions a model of the ark of Deucalion. But it is indeed surprising
to find this practice perpetuated, even to our own times, by a race of
Indians in the heart of America. On page 158 of the first volume of the
same work Catlin describes the great annual mysteries and religious
ceremonials of which this image of the ark was the centre. He says:

"On the day set apart for the commencement of the ceremonies a solitary
figure is seen approaching the village.

"During the deafening din and confusion within the pickets

of the village the figure discovered on the prairie continued to
approach with a dignified step, and in a right line toward the village;
all eyes were upon him, and he at length made his appearance within the
pickets, and proceeded toward the centre of the village, where all the
chiefs and braves stood ready to receive him, which they did in a
cordial manner by shaking hands, recognizing him as an old acquaintance,
and pronouncing his name, Nu-mohk-muck-a-nah (*the first or only man*).
The body of this strange personage, which was chiefly naked, was painted
with white clay, so as to resemble at a distance a white man. He enters
the medicine lodge, and goes through certain mysterious ceremonies.

"During the whole of this day Nu-mohk-muck-a-nah (the first or only man)
travelled through the village, stopping in front of each man's lodge,
and crying until the owner of the lodge came out and asked who he was,
and what was the matter? To which be replied by narrating *the sad
catastrophe which had happened on the earth's surface by the overflowing
of the waters*, saying that 'he was the *only person saved from the
universal calamity*; that he landed his big canoe on a high mountain in
the west, where he now resides; that be has come to open the medicine
lodge, which must needs receive a present of an edged tool from the
owner of every wigwam, that it may be sacrificed to the water; for,' he
says, 'if this is not done there will be another flood, and no one will
be saved, as it was with such tools that the big canoe was made.'

"Having visited every lodge in the village during the day, and having
received such a present from each as a hatchet, a knife, etc. (which is
undoubtedly always prepared ready for the occasion), be places them in
the medicine lodge; and, on the last day of the ceremony, they are
thrown into a deep place in the river--'sacrificed to the Spirit of the
Waters."'

Among the sacred articles kept in the great medicine lodge are four
sacks of water, called *Eeh-teeh-ka*, sewed together, each of them in
the form of a tortoise lying on its back, with a bunch of eagle feathers
attached to its tail. "These four tortoises," they told me, "contained
the waters from the four quarters of the world--that those waters had
been contained therein *ever since the settling down of the waters*," "I
did

<span id="page_113">p. 113</span>

not," says Catlin, who knew nothing of an Atlantis theory, "think it
best to advance anything against such a ridiculous belief." Catlin tried
to purchase one of these water-sacks, but could not obtain it for any
price; he was told they were "*a society property*."

He then describes a dance by twelve men around the ark: "They arrange
themselves according to *the four cardinal points*; two are painted
perfectly *black*, two are vermilion color, some were painted partially
white. They dance a dance called '*Bel*-lohck-na-pie,'" with horns on
their heads, like those used in Europe as symbolical of *Bel*, or Baal.

Could anything be more evident than the connection of these ceremonies
with the destruction of Atlantis? Here we have the image of the ark;
here we have a white man coming with the news that "the waters had
overflowed the land," and that all the people were destroyed except
himself; here we have the sacrifice to appease the spirit that caused
the Flood, just as we find the Flood terminating, in the Hebrew,
Chaldean, and Central American legends, with a sacrifice. Here, too, we
have the image of the tortoise, which we find in other flood legends of
the Indians, and which is a very natural symbol for an island. As one of
our own poets has expressed it,

"Very fair and full of promise  
Lay the island of St. Thomas;  
Like a great green turtle slumbered  
On the sea which it encumbered."

Here we have, too, the four quarters of Atlantis, divided by its four
rivers, as we shall see a little farther on, represented in a dance,
where the dancers arrange themselves according to the four cardinal
points of the compass; the dancers are painted to represent the black
and red races, while "the first and only man" represents the white race;
and the name of the dance is a reminiscence of Baal, the ancient god of
the races derived from Atlantis.

But this is not all. The Mandans were evidently of the race

<span id="page_114">p. 114</span>

of Atlantis. They have another singular legend, which we find in the
account of Lewis and Clarke:

"Their belief in a future state is connected with this theory of their
origin: The whole nation resided in one large village, underground, near
a subterranean lake. A grape-vine extended its roots down to their
habitation, and gave them a view of the light. Some of the most
adventurous climbed up the vine, and were delighted with the sight of
the earth, which they found covered with buffalo, and rich with every
kind of fruit. Returning with the grapes they had gathered, their
countrymen were so pleased with the taste of them that the whole nation
resolved to leave their dull residence for the charms of the upper
region. Men, women, and children ascended by means of the vine, but,
when about half the nation had reached the surface of the earth, a
corpulent woman, who was clambering up the vine, broke it with her
weight, and closed upon herself and the rest of the nation the light of
the sun."

This curious tradition means. that the present nation dwelt in a large
settlement underground, that is, beyond the land, in the sea; the sea
being represented by "the subterranean lake." At one time the people had
free intercourse between this "large village" and the American
continent, and they founded extensive colonies on this continent;
whereupon some mishap cut them off from the mother country. This
explanation is confirmed by the fact that in the legends of the Iowa
Indians, who were a branch of the Dakotas, or Sioux Indians, and
relatives of the Mandans (according to Major James W. Lynd), "all the
tribes of Indians were formerly one, and all dwelt together *on an
island*, or at least across a large water *toward the east or sunrise*.
They crossed this water in skin canoes, or by swimming; but they know
not how long they were in crossing, or whether the water was salt or
fresh." While the Dakotas, according to Major Lynd, who lived among them
for nine years, possessed legends of "huge skiffs, in which the Dakotas
of old floated for weeks, finally gaining dry land"--a reminiscence of
ships and long sea-voyages.

<span id="page_115">p. 115</span>

The Mandans celebrated their great religious festival above described in
the season when the willow is first in leaf, and a dove is mixed up in
the ceremonies; and they further relate a legend that "the world was
once a great tortoise, borne on the waters, and covered with earth, and
that when one day, in digging the soil, a tribe of white men, who had
made holes in the earth to a great depth digging for badgers, at length
pierced the shell of the tortoise, it sank, and the water covering it
drowned all men with the exception of one, who saved himself in a boat;
and when the earth re-emerged, sent out a dove, who returned with a
branch of willow in its beak."

The holes dug to find badgers were a savage's recollection of mining
operations; and when the great disaster came, and the island sunk in the
sea amid volcanic convulsions, doubtless men said it was due to the deep
mines, which had opened the way to the central fires. But the recurrence
of "white men" as the miners, and of a white man as "the last and only
man," and the presence of white blood in the veins of the people, all
point to the same conclusion--that the Mandans were colonists from
Atlantis.

And here I might add that Catlin found the following singular
resemblances between the Mandan tongue and the Welsh:

According to Major Lynd, the Dakotas, or Sioux, belonged to the same
race as the Mandans; hence the interest which .attaches to these verbal
similarities.

"Among the Iroquois there is a tradition that the sea and waters
infringed upon the land, so that all human life was destroyed. The
Chickasaws assert that the world was once destroyed by water, but that
one family was saved, and two animals of every kind. The Sioux say there
was a time when there was no dry land, and all men had disappeared from
existence." (See Lynd's "MS. History of the Dakotas," Library of
Historical Society of Minnesota.)

"The Okanagaus have a god, Skyappe, and also one called Chacha, who
appear to be endowed with omniscience; but their principal divinity is
their great mythical ruler and heroine, Scomalt. Long ago, when the sun
was no bigger than a star, this strong medicine-woman ruled over what
appears to have now become a *lost island*. At last the peace of the
island was destroyed by war, and the noise of battle was heard, with
which Scomalt was exceeding wroth, whereupon she rose up in her might
and drove her rebellious subjects to one end of the island, and broke
off the piece of land on which they were huddled and pushed it out to
sea, to drift whither it would. This floating island was tossed to and
fro and buffeted by the winds till all but two died. A man and woman
escaped in a canoe, and arrived on the main-land; and from these the
Okanagaus are descended." (Bancroft's "Native Races," vol. iii., p.
149.)

Here we have the Flood legend clearly connected with a lost island.

The Nicaraguans believed "that ages ago the world was destroyed by a
flood, in which the most part of mankind perished. Afterward the
*teotes*, or gods, restored the earth as at the beginning." (*Ibid*., p.
75.) The wild Apaches, "wild from their natal hour," have a legend that
"the first days of the world were happy and peaceful days;" then came a
great flood, from which Montezuma and the coyote alone escaped.
Montezuma became then very wicked, and attempted to build a house that
would reach to heaven, but the Great

Spirit destroyed it with thunderbolts. (Bancroft's "Native Races," vol.
iii., p. 76.)

The Pimas, an Indian tribe allied to the Papagos, have a peculiar flood
legend. The son of the Creator was called Szeu-kha (Ze-us?). An eagle
prophesied the deluge to the prophet of the people three times in
succession, but his warning was despised; "then in the twinkling of an
eye there came a peal of thunder and an awful crash, and a green mound
of water reared itself over the plain. It seemed to stand upright for a
second, then, cut incessantly by the lightning, goaded on like a great
beast, it flung itself upon the prophet's hut. When the morning broke
there was nothing to be seen alive but one man--if indeed be were a man;
Szeu-kha, the son of the Creator, had saved himself by floating on a
ball of gum or resin." This instantaneous catastrophe reminds one
forcibly of the destruction of Atlantis. Szeu-kha killed the eagle,
restored its victims to life, and repeopled the earth with them, as
Deucalion repeopled the earth with the stones.
