## CHAPTER VIII.

### THE OLDEST SON OF NOAH.

THAT eminent authority, Dr. Max Müller, says, in his "Lectures on the
Science of Religion,"

"If we confine ourselves to the Asiatic continent, with its important
peninsula of Europe, we find that in the vast desert of drifting human
speech three, and only three, oases have been formed in which, *before
the beginning of all history*, language became permanent and
traditional--assumed, in fact, a new character, a character totally
different from the original character of the floating and constantly
varying speech of human beings. These three oases of language are known
by the name of *Turanian*, *Aryan*, and *Semitic*. In these three
centres, more particularly in the *Aryan* and *Semitic*, language ceased
to be natural; its growth was arrested, and it became permanent, solid,
petrified, or, if you like, historical speech. I have always maintained
that this centralization and traditional conservation of language could
only have been the result of religious and political influences, and I
now mean to show that we really have clear evidence of three independent
settlements of religion--the *Turanian*, the *Aryan*, and the
*Semitic*--concomitantly with the three great settlements of language."

There can be no doubt that the Aryan and another branch, which Müller
calls Semitic, but which may more properly be called Hamitic, radiated
from Noah; it is a question yet to be decided whether the Turanian or
Mongolian is also a branch of the Noachic or Atlantean stock.

To quote again from Max Müller:

"If it can only be proved that the religions of the Aryan nations are
united by the same bonds of a real relationship

<span id="page_424">p. 424</span>

which have enabled us to treat their languages as so many varieties of
the same type--and so also of the Semitic--the field thus opened is vast
enough, and its careful clearing, and cultivation will occupy several
generations of scholars. And this original relationship, I believe, can
be proved. Names of the principal deities, words also expressive of the
most essential elements of religion, such as *prayer*, *sacrifice*,
*altar*, *spirit*, *law*, and *faith*, have been preserved among the
Aryan and among the Semitic nations, and these relies admit of one
explanation only. After that, a comparative study of the Turanian
religions may be approached with better hope of success; for that there
was not only a primitive Aryan and a primitive Semitic religion, *but
likewise a primitive Turanian religion, before each of these primeval
races was broken up and became separated in language, worship and
national sentiment, admits, I believe, of little doubt*. . . . There was
a period during which the ancestors of the Semitic family had not yet
been divided, whether in language or in religion. That period transcends
the recollection of every one of the Semitic races, in the same way as
neither Hindoos, Greeks, nor Romans have any recollection of the time
when they spoke a common language, and worshipped their Father in heaven
by a name that was as yet neither Sanscrit, nor Greek, nor Latin. But I
do not hesitate to call this Prehistoric Period historical in the best
sense of the word. It was a real period, because, unless it was real,
all the realities of the Semitic languages and the Semitic religions,
such as we find them after their separation, would be unintelligible.
Hebrew, Syriac, and Arabic point to a common source as much as Sanscrit,
Greek, and Latin; and unless we can bring ourselves to doubt that the
Hindoos, the Greeks, the Romans, and the Teutons derived the worship of
their principal deity from their common Aryan sanctuary, we shall not be
able to deny that there was likewise a primitive religion of the whole
Semitic race, and that *El*, the Strong One in heaven, was invoked by
the ancestors of all the Semitic races before there were Babylonians in
Babylon, Phœnicians in Sidon and Tyrus--before there were Jews in
Mesopotamia or Jerusalem. The evidence of the Semitic is the same as
that of the Aryan languages: the conclusion cannot be different....

"These three classes of religion are not to be mistaken--as little as
the three classes of language, the Turanian, the Semitic,

<span id="page_425">p. 425</span>

and the Aryan. They mark three events in the most ancient history of the
world, events which have determined the whole fate of the human race,
and of which we ourselves still feel the consequences in our language,
in our thoughts, and in our religion."

We have seen that all the evidence points to the fact that this original
seat of the Phœnician-Hebrew family was in Atlantis.

The great god of the so-called Semites was El, the Strong One, from
whose name comes the Biblical names *Beth-el*, the house of God;
*Ha-el*, the strong one; *El-ohim*, the gods; *El-oah*, God; and from
the same name is derived the Arabian name of God, Al-lah.

Another evidence of the connection between the Greeks, Phœnicians,
Hebrews, and Atlanteans is shown in the name of Adonis.

The Greeks tell us that Adonis was the lover of Aphrodite, or Venus, who
was the offspring of Uranus--"she came out of the sea;" Uranus was the
father of Chronos, and the grandfather of Poseidon, king of Atlantis.

Now We find *Adonâi* in the Old Testament used exclusively as the name
of Jehovah, while among the Phœnicians Adonâi was the supreme deity. In
both cases the root *Ad* is probably a reminiscence of *Ad*-lantis.

There seem to exist similar connections between the Egyptian and the
Turanian mythology. The great god of Egypt was Neph or Num; the chief
god of the Samoyedes is Num; and Max Müller established an identity
between the *Num* of the Samoyedes and the god *Yum-ala* of the Finns,
and probably with the name of the god *Nam* of the Thibetians.

That mysterious people, the Etruscans, who inhabited part of Italy, and
whose bronze implements agreed exactly in style and workmanship with
those which we think were derived from Atlantis, were, it is now
claimed, a branch of the Turanian family.

<span id="page_426">p. 426</span>

"At a recent meeting of the English Philological Society great interest
was excited by a paper on Etruscan Numerals, by the Rev. Isaac Taylor.
He stated that the long-sought key to the Etruscan language had at last
been discovered. Two dice had been found in a tomb, with their six faces
marked with words instead of pips. He showed that these words were
identical with the first six digits in the Altaic branch of the Turanian
family of speech. Guided by this clew, it was easy to prove that the
grammar and vocabulary of the 3000 Etruscan inscriptions were also
Altaic. The words denoting kindred, the pronouns, the conjugations, and
the declensions, corresponded closely to those of the Tartar tribes of
Siberia. The Etruscan mythology proved to be essentially the same as
that of the Kalevala, the great Finnic epic."

According to Lenormant ("Ancient History of the East," vol. i., p. 62;
vol. ii., p. 23), the early contests between the Aryans and the
Turanians are represented in the Iranian traditions as "contests between
hostile *brothers* . . . the Ugro-Finnish races must, according to all
appearances, be looked upon as *a branch, earlier detached than the
others from the Japhetic stem*."

If it be true that the first branch originating from Atlantis was the
Turanian, which includes the Chinese and Japanese, then we have derived
from Atlantis all the building and metalworking races of men who have
proved themselves capable of civilization; and we may, therefore, divide
mankind into two great classes: those capable of civilization, derived
from Atlantis, and those essentially and at all times barbarian, who
hold no blood relationship with the people of Atlantis.

Humboldt is sure "that some connection existed between ancient Ethiopia
and the elevated plain of Central Asia." There were invasions which
reached from the shores of Arabia into China. "An Arabian sovereign,
Schamar-Iarasch (Abou Karib), is described by Hamza, Nuwayri, and others
as a powerful ruler and conqueror, who carried his arms successfully far
into Central Asia; he occupied Samarcand and invaded China. He erected
an edifice at Samarcand, bearing an inscription, in

<span id="page_427">p. 427</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Himyarite or
Cushite characters, 'In the name of God, Schamar-Iarasch has erected
this edifice to the sun, his Lord." (Baldwin's "Prehistoric Nations," p.
110.) These invasions must have been prior to 1518 B.C.

Charles Walcott Brooks read a paper before the California Academy of
Sciences, in which be says:

"According to Chinese annals, Tai-Ko-Fokee, the great stranger king,
ruled the kingdom of China. In pictures he is represented with two small
horns, like those associated with the representations of Moses. He and
his successor are said to have introduced into China 'picture-writing,'
like that in use in Central America at the time of the Spanish conquest.
He taught the motions of the heavenly bodies, and divided time into
years and months; be also introduced many other useful arts and
sciences.

"Now, there has been found at Copan, in Central America, a figure
strikingly like the Chinese symbol of Fokee, with his two horns; and, in
like manner, there is a close resemblance between the Central American
and the Chinese figures representing earth and heaven. Either one people
learned from the other, or both acquired these forms <span

from a common source. Many physico-geographical facts favor the
hypothesis that they were derived in very remote ages from America, and
that from China they passed to Egypt. Chinese records say that the
progenitors of the Chinese race came from across the sea."

The two small horns of Tai-Ko-Fokee and Moses are probably a
reminiscence of Baal. We find the horns of Baal represented in the
remains of the Bronze Age of Europe. Bel sometimes wore a tiara with his
bull's horns; the tiara was the crown subsequently worn by the Persian
kings, and it became, in time, the symbol of Papal authority.

The Atlanteans having domesticated cattle, and discovered

<span id="page_428">p. 428</span>

their vast importance to humanity, associated the bull and cow with
religious ideas, as revealed in the oldest hymns of the Aryans and the
cow-headed idols of Troy, a representation of one of which is shown on
the preceding page. Upon the head of their great god Baal they placed
the horns of the bull; and these have descended in popular imagination
to the spirit of evil of our day. Burns says:

"O thou! whatever title suit thee,  
Auld *Hornie*, Satan, Nick, or Clootie."

"Clootie" is derived from the cleft hoof of a cow; while the Scotch name
for a bull is *Bill*, a corruption, probably, of Bel. Less than two
hundred years ago it was customary to sacrifice a bull on the 25th of
August to the "God Mowrie" and "his devilans" on the island of Inis
Maree, Scotland. ("The Past

in the Present," p. 165.) The trident of Poseidon has degenerated into
the pitchfork of Beelzebub!

And when we cross the Atlantic, we find in America the horns of Baal
reappearing in a singular manner. The first cut on page
[429](#img_42900) represents an idol of the Moquis of New Mexico: the
head is very bull-like. In the [next figure](#img_42901) we have a
representation of the war-god of the Dakotas, with something like a

<span id="page_429">p. 429</span>

trident in his hand; while the [next illustration](#img_42902) is taken
from Zarate's "Peru," and depicts "the god of a degrading worship." He
is very much like the traditional conception of the European
devil-horns, pointed ears, wings, and poker. Compare this last figure,
from Peru, with the representation on page [430](#img_43000) of a Greek
siren, one of those cruel monsters who, according to Grecian mythology,
sat in the midst of bones and blood, tempting men to ruin by their sweet
music. Here we have the same bird-like legs and claws as in the Peruvian
demon.

ancient times between the Black Sea and "Great Mongolia;" he mentions a
"Temple of the Sun," and a great caravansary in the desert of Gobi.
Arminius Vámbéry, in his "Travels in Central Asia," describes very
important ruins near the eastern shore of the Caspian Sea, at a place
called Gömüshtepe; and connected with these are the remains of a great
wall which he followed "ten geographical miles." He found a vast
aqueduct one hundred and fifty miles long, extending to the Persian
mountains. He reports abundant ruins in all that country, *extending
even to China*.

The early history of China indicates contact with a superior

<span id="page_430">p. 430</span>

race. "Fuh-hi, who is regarded as a demi-god, founded the Chinese Empire
2852 B.C. He introduced cattle, taught the people how to raise them, and
taught the art of writing." ("American Cyclopædia," art. *China*.) He
might have invented <span id="img_43000"></span>

his alphabet, but he did not invent the cattle; he must have got them
from some nation who, during many centuries of civilization, had
domesticated them; and from what nation was he more likely to have
obtained them than from the Atlanteans, whose colonies we have seen
reached his borders, and whose armies invaded his territory! "He
instituted the ceremony of marriage." (*Ibid*.) This also was an
importation from a civilized land. "His successor, Shin-nung, during a
reign of one hundred and forty years, introduced agriculture and medical
science. The next emperor, Hwang-ti, is believed to have invented
weapons, wagons, ships, clocks, and musical instruments, and to have
introduced coins, weights, and measures." (*Ibid*.) As these various
inventions in all other countries have been the result of slow
development, running through many centuries, or are borrowed from some
other more civilized people, it is certain that no emperor of China ever
invented them all during a period of one hundred and sixty-four

<span id="page_431">p. 431</span>

years. These, then, were also importations from the West. In fact, the
Chinese themselves claim to have invaded China in the early days *from
the north-west*; and their first location is placed by Winchell near
Lake Balkat, a short distance east of the Caspian, where we have already
seen Aryan Atlantean colonies planted at an early day. "The third
successor of Fuh-hi, Ti-ku, established schools, and was the first to
practise polygamy. In 2357 his son Yau ascended the throne, and it is
from his reign that the regular historical records begin. A great flood,
which occurred in his reign, has been considered synchronous and
identical with the Noachic Deluge, and to Yau is attributed the merit of
having successfully battled against the waters."

There can be no question that the Chinese themselves, in their early
legends, connected their origin with a people who were destroyed by
water in a tremendous convulsion of the earth. Associated with this
event was a divine personage called Niu-va (Noah?).

Sir William Jones says:

"The Chinese believe the earth to have been wholly covered with water,
which, in works of undisputed authenticity, they describe as flowing
abundantly, then subsiding and *separating the higher from the lower
ages of mankind*; that this division of time, from which their poetical
history begins, just preceded the appearance of Fo-hi on the mountains
of Chin. ("Discourse on the Chinese; Asiatic Researches," vol. ii., p.
376.)

The following history of this destruction of their ancestors vividly
recalls to us the convulsion depicted in the Chaldean and American
legends:

"The pillars of heaven were broken; the earth shook to its very
foundations; the heavens sunk lower toward the north; the sun, the moon,
and the stars changed their motions; the earth fell to pieces, and the
waters enclosed within its bosom burst forth with violence and
overflowed it. Man having rebelled against Heaven, the system of the
universe was totally

<span id="page_432">p. 432</span>

disordered. The sun was eclipsed, the planets altered their course, and
the grand harmony of nature was disturbed."

A learned Frenchman, M. Terrien de la Couperie, member of the Asiatic
Society of Paris, has just published a work (1880) in which he
demonstrates the astonishing fact that the Chinese language is clearly
related to the Chaldean, and that both the Chinese characters and the
cuneiform alphabet are degenerate descendants of an original
hieroglyphical alphabet. The same signs exist for many words, while
numerous words are very much alike. M. de la Couperie gives a table of
some of these similarities, from which I quote as follows:

This surprising discovery brings the Chinese civilization still nearer
to the Mediterranean head-quarters of the races, and increases the
probability that the arts of China were of Atlantean origin; and that
the name of Nai Hoang-ti, or Nai Korti, the founder of Chinese
civilization, may be a reminiscence of Nakhunta, the chief of the gods,
as recorded in the Susian texts, and this, in turn, a recollection of
the Deva-Nahusha of the Hindoos, the Dionysos of the Greeks, the king of
Atlantis, whose great empire reached to the "farther parts of India,"
and embraced, according to Plato, "parts of the continent of America."

Linguistic science achieved a great discovery when it established the
fact that there was a continuous belt of languages from Iceland to
Ceylon which were the variant forms of one

<span id="page_433">p. 433</span>

mother-tongue, the Indo-European; but it must prepare itself for a still
wider generalization. There is abundant proof--proof with which pages
might be filled--that there was a still older mother-tongue, from which
Aryan, Semitic, and Hamitic were all derived--the language of Noah, the
language of Atlantis, the language of the great "aggressive empire" of
Plato, the language of the empire of the Titans.

The Arabic word *bin*, within, becomes, when it means interval, space,
*binnon*; this is the German and Dutch *binnen* and Saxon *binnon*,
signifying within. The Ethiopian word *aorf*, to fall asleep, is the
root of the word *Morpheus*, the god of sleep. The Hebrew word *chanah*,
to dwell, is the parent of the Anglo-Saxon *inne* and Icelandic *inni*,
a house, and of our word *inn*, a hotel. The Hebrew word *naval* or
*nafal* signifies to fall; from it is derived our word fall and fool
(one who falls); the Chaldee word is *nabal*, to make foul, and the
Arabic word *nabala* means to die, that is, to fall. From the last
syllable of the Chaldee *nasar*, to saw, we can derive the Latin
*serra*, the High German *sagen*, the Danish *sauga*, and our word *to
saw*. The Arabic *nafida*, to fade, is the same as the Italian *fado*,
the Latin *fatuus* (foolish, tasteless), the Dutch *vadden*, and our *to
fade*. The Ethiopic word *gaber*, to make, to do, and the Arabic word
*jabara*, to make strong, becomes the Welsh word *goberu*, to work, to
operate, the Latin *operor*, and the English *operate*. The Arabic word
*abara* signifies to prick, to sting; we see this root in the Welsh
*bar*, a summit, and *pâr*, a spear, and *per*, a spit; whence our word
*spear*. In the Chaldee, Syriac, and Arabic *zug* means to join, to
couple; from this the Greeks obtained zugos, the Romans *jugum*, and we
the word *yoke*; while the Germans obtained *jok* or *jog*, the Dutch
*juk*, the Swedes *ok*. The Sanscrit is *juga*. The Arabic *sanna*, to
be old, reappears in the Latin *senex*, the Welsh *hen*, and our
*senile*. The Hebrew *banah*, to build, is the Irish *bun*, foundation,
and the Latin *fundo*, *fundare*, to found. The Arabic *baraka*, to bend
the knee, to fall on the breast, is probably the

<span id="page_434">p. 434</span>

Saxon *brecau*, the Danish *bräkke*, the Swedish bräcka, Welsh *bregu*,
and our word *to break*. The Arabic *baraka* also signifies to rain
violently; and from this we get the Saxon *rœgn*, to rain, Dutch
*regen*, to rain, Cimbric *rœkia*, rain, Welsh *rheg*, rain. The Chaldee
word *braic*, a branch, is the Irish *braic* or *raigh*, an arm, the
Welsh *braic*, the Latin *brachium*, and the English *brace*, something
which supports like an arm. The Chaldee *frak*, to rub, to tread out
grain, is the same as the Latin *frico*, *frio*, and our word *rake*.
The Arabic word to rub is *fraka*. The Chaldee *rag*, *ragag*, means to
desire, to long for; it is the same as the Greek oregw, the Latin
*porrigere*, the Saxon *rœccan*, the Icelandic *rakna*, the German
*reichen*, and our *to reach*, to rage. The Arabic *rauka*, to strain or
purify, as wine, is precisely our English word *rack*, to rack wine. The
Hebrew word *bara*, to create, is our word to bear, as to bear children:
a great number of words in all the European languages contain this root
in its various modifications. The Hebrew word *kafar*, to cover, is our
word *to cover*, and *coffer*, something which covers, and *covert*, a
secret place; from this root also comes the Latin *cooperio* and the
French *couvrir*, to cover. The Arabic word *shakala*, to bind under the
belly, is our word *to shackle*. From the Arabic *walada* and Ethiopian
*walad*, to beget, to bring forth, we get the Welsh *llawd*, a shooting
out; and hence our word *lad*. Our word *matter*, or *pus*, is from the
Arabic *madda*; our word *mature* is originally from the Chaldee *mita*.
The Arabic word *amida* signifies to end, and from this comes the noun,
a limit, a termination, Latin *meta*, and our words *meet* and *mete*.

I might continue this list, but I have given enough to show that all the
Atlantean races once spoke the same language, and that the dispersion on
the plains of Shinar signifies that breaking up of the tongues of one
people under the operation of vast spaces of time. Philology is yet in
its infancy, and the time is not far distant when the identity of the
languages of all the Noachic races will be as clearly established and as
universally

<span id="page_435">p. 435</span>

acknowledged as is now the identity, of the languages of the Aryan
family of nations.

And precisely as recent research has demonstrated the relationship
between Pekin and Babylon, so investigation in Central America has
proved that there is a mysterious bond of union connecting the Chinese
and one of the races of Mexico. The resemblances are so great that Mr.
Short ("North Americans of Antiquity," p. 494) says, "There is no doubt
that strong analogies exist between the Otomi and the Chinese." Señor
Najera ("Dissertacion Sobre la lingua Othomi, Mexico," pp. 87, 88) gives
a list of words from which I quote the following:

Recently Herr Forchhammer, of Leipsic, has published a truly scientific
comparison of the grammatical structure of the Choctaw, Chickasaw,
Muscogee, and Seminole languages with the Ural-Altaic tongues, in which
be has developed many interesting points of resemblance.

It has been the custom to ascribe the recognized similarities between
the Indians of America and the Chinese and Japanese to a migration by
way of Behring's Strait from Asia into America; but when we find that
the Chinese themselves only

<span id="page_436">p. 436</span>

reached the Pacific coast within the Historical Period, and that they
came to it from the direction of the Mediterranean and Atlantis, and
when we find so many and such distinct recollections of the destruction
of Atlantis in the Flood le(rends of the American races, it seems more
reasonable to conclude that the resemblances between the Othomi and the
Chinese are to be accounted for by intercourse through Atlantis.

We find a confirmation in all these facts of the order in which Genesis
names the sons of Noah:

"Now these are the generations of the sons of Noah: Shem, Ham, and
Japheth, and unto them were sons born after the flood."

Can we not suppose that those three sons represent three great races in
the order of their precedence?

The record of Genesis claims that the Phœnicians were descended from
Ham, while the Hebrews were descended from Shem; yet we find the Hebrews
and Phœnicians united by the ties of a common language, common
traditions, and common race characteristics. The Jews are the great
merchants of the world eighteen centuries after Christ, just as the
Phœnicians were the great merchants of the world fifteen centuries
before Christ.

Moreover, the Arabians, who are popularly classed as Semites, or sons of
Shem, admit in their traditions that they are descended from "Ad, *the
son of Ham*;" and the tenth chapter of Genesis classes them among the
descendants of Ham, calling them Seba, Havilah, Raamah, etc. If the two
great so-called Semitic stocks--the Phœnicians and Arabians--are
Hamites, surely the third member of the group belongs to the same
"sunburnt" race.

If we concede that the Jews were also a branch of the Hamitic stock,
then we have, firstly, a Semitic stock, the Turanian, embracing the
Etruscans, the Finns, the Tartars, the Mongols, the Chinese, and
Japanese; secondly, a Hamitic family,

<span id="page_437">p. 437</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> "the sunburnt"
race--a red race--including the Cushites, Phœnicians, Egyptians,
Hebrews, Berbers, etc.; and, thirdly, a Japhetic or whiter stock,
embracing the Greeks, Italians, Celts, Goths, and the men who wrote
Sanscrit-in other words, the entire Aryan family.

If we add to these three races the negro race--which cannot be traced
back to Atlantis, and is not included, according to Genesis, among the
descendants of Noah--we have the four races, the *white*, *red*,
*yellow*, and *black*, recognized by the Egyptians as embracing all the
people known to them.

There seems to be some confusion in Genesis as to the Semitic stock. It
classes different races as both Semites and Hamites; as, for instance,
Sheba and Havilah; while the race of Mash, or Meshech, is classed among
the sons of Shem and the sons of Japheth. In fact, there seems to be a
confusion of Hamitic and Semitic stocks. "This is shown in the blending
of Hamitic and Semitic in some of the most ancient inscriptions; in the
facility of intercourse between the Semites of Asia and the Hamites of
Egypt; in the peaceful and unobserved absorption of all the Asiatic
Hamites, and the Semitic adoption of the Hamitic gods and religious
system. It is manifest that, at a period not long previous, *the two
families* had dwelt together and spoken the same language." (Winchell's
"Pre-Adamites," p. 36.) Is it not more reasonable to suppose that the
so-called Semitic races of Genesis were a mere division of the Hamitic
stock, and that we are to look for the third great division of the sons
of Noah among the Turanians?

Francis Lenormant, high authority, is of the opinion that the Turanian
races are descended from Magog, the son of Japheth. He regards the
Turanians as intermediate between the white and yellow races, graduating
insensibly into each. "The Uzbecs, the Osmanli Turks, and the Hungarians
are not to be distinguished in appearance from the most perfect branches
of the white race; on the other hand, the Tchondes almost exactly
resemble the Tongouses, who belong to the yellow race.

<span id="page_438">p. 438</span>

The Turanian languages are marked by the same agglutinative character
found in the American races.

The Mongolian and the Indian are alike in the absence of a heavy beard.
The royal color of the Incas was yellow; yellow is the color of the
imperial family in China. The religion of the Peruvians was sun-worship;
"the sun was the peculiar god of the Mongols from the earliest times."
The Peruvians regarded Pachacamac as the sovereign creator. Camac-Hya
was the name of a Hindoo goddess. *Haylli* was the burden of every verse
of the song composed in praise of the sun and the Incas. Mr. John
Ranking derives the word *Allah* from the word *Haylli*, also the word
*Halle*-lujah. In the city of Cuzco was a portion of land which none
were permitted to cultivate except those of the royal blood. At certain
seasons the Incas turned up the sod here, amid much rejoicing, and many
ceremonies. A similar custom prevails in China: The emperor ploughs a
few furrows, and twelve illustrious persons attend the plough after him.
(Du Halde, "Empire of China," vol. i., p. 275.) The cycle of sixty years
was in use among most of the nations of Eastern Asia, and among the
Muyscas of the elevated plains of Bogota. *The "quipu," a knotted
reckoning-cord, was in use in Peru and in China*. (Bancroft's "Native
Races," vol. v., p. 48.) In Peru and China "both use hieroglyphics,
which are read from above downward." (*Ibid*.)

"It appears most evident to me," says Humboldt, "that the monuments,
methods of computing time, systems of cosmogony, and many myths of
America, offer striking analogies with the ideas of Eastern
Asia--*analogies which indicate an ancient communication*, and are not
simply the result of that uniform condition in which all nations are
found in the dawn of civilization." ("Exam. Crit.," tom. ii., p. 68.)

"In the ruined cities of Cambodia, which lies farther to the east of
Burmah, recent research has discovered teocallis like those in Mexico,
and the remains of temples of the same type and pattern as those of
Yucatan. And when we reach the sea

<span id="page_439">p. 439</span>

we encounter at Suku, in Java, a teocalli which is absolutely identical
with that of Tehuantepec. Mr. Ferguson said, 'as we advance eastward
from the valley of the Euphrates, at every step we meet with forms of
art becoming more and more like those of Central America.'" ("Builders
of Babel," p. 88.)

Prescott says:

The coincidences are sufficiently strong to authorize a belief that the
civilization of Anahuac was in some degree influenced by that of Eastern
Asia; and, secondly, that the discrepancies are such *as to carry back
the communication to a very remote period*." ("Mexico," vol. iii., p.
418.)

"All appearances," continues Lenormant ("Ancient History of the East,"
vol. i., p. 64), "would lead us to regard the Turanian race as the first
branch of the family of Japheth which went forth into the world; and by
that premature separation, by an isolated and antagonistic existence,
took, or rather preserved, a completely distinct physiognomy. . . . It
is a type of the white race imperfectly developed."

We may regard this yellow race as the first and oldest wave from
Atlantis, and, therefore, reaching farthest away from the common source;
then came the Hamitic race; then the Japhetic.
