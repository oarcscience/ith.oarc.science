## CHAPTER V.

### THE PYRAMID, THE CROSS, AND THE GARDEN OF EDEN.

No fact is better established than the reverence shown to the sign of
the Cross in all the ages prior to Christianity. We cannot do better
than quote from an able article in the Edinburgh Review of July, 1870,
upon this question:

"From the dawn of organized Paganism in the Eastern world to the final
establishment of Christianity in the Western, the Cross was undoubtedly
one of the commonest and most sacred of symbolical monuments; and, to a
remarkable extent, it is so still in almost every land where that of
Calvary is unrecognized or unknown. Apart from any distinctions of
social or intellectual superiority, of caste, color, nationality, or
location in either hemisphere, it appears to have been the aboriginal
possession of every people in antiquity--the elastic girdle, so to say,
which embraced the most widely separated heathen communities--the most
significant token of a universal brotherhood, to which all the families
of mankind were severally and irresistibly drawn, and by which *their
common descent was emphatically expressed*, or by means of which each
and all preserved, amid every vicissitude of fortune, a knowledge of
*the primeval happiness and dignity of their species*. Where authentic
history is silent on the subject, the material relics of past and long
since forgotten races are not wanting to confirm and strengthen this
supposition. Diversified forms of the symbol are delineated more or less
artistically, according to the progress achieved in civilization at the
period, on the ruined walls of temples and palaces, on natural rocks and
sepulchral galleries, on the hoariest monoliths and the rudest statuary;
on coins, medals, and vases of every description; and, in not a few
instances, are preserved in the architectural proportions of
subterranean

<span id="page_318">p. 318</span>

as well as superterranean structures, of tumuli as well as fanes. The
extraordinary sanctity attaching to the symbol, in every age and under
every variety of circumstance, justified any expenditure incurred in its
fabrication or embellishment; hence the most persistent labor, the most
consummate ingenuity, were lavished upon it. Populations of essentially
different culture, tastes, and pursuits--the highly-civilized and the
demi-civilized, the settled and nomadic--vied with each other in their
efforts to extend the knowledge of its exceptional import and virtue
among their latest posterities. The marvellous rock-hewn caves of
Elephanta and Ellora, and the stately temples of Mathura and Terputty,
in the East, may be cited as characteristic examples of one laborious
method of exhibiting it; and the megalithic structures of Callernish and
Newgrange, in the West, of another; while a third may be instanced. in
the great temple at Mitzla, 'the City of the Moon,' in Ojaaca, Central
America. also excavated in the living rock, and manifesting the same
stupendous labor and ingenuity as are observable in the cognate caverns
of Salsette--of endeavors, we repeat, made by peoples as intellectually
as geographically distinct, and followers withal of independent and
unassociated deities, to magnify and perpetuate some grand primeval
symbol. . . .

"Of the several varieties of the Cross still in vogue, as national or
ecclesiastical emblems, in this and other European states, and
distinguished by the familiar appellations of St. George, St. Andrew,
the Maltese, the Greek, the Latin, etc., etc., there is not one among
them the existence of which may not be traced to the remotest antiquity.
They were the common property of the Eastern nations. No revolution or
other casualty has wrought any perceptible difference in their several
forms or delineations; they have passed from one hemisphere to the other
intact; have survived dynasties, empires, and races; have been borne on
the crest of each successive wave of Aryan population in its course
toward the West; and, having been reconsecrated in later times by their
lineal descendants, are still recognized as military and national badges
of distinction. . . .

"Among the earliest known types is the *crux ansata*, vulgarly called
'the key of the Nile,' because of its being found sculptured or
otherwise represented so frequently upon Egyptian and Coptic monuments.
It has, however, a very much older and more sacred signification than
this. It was the symbol of

<span id="page_319">p. 319</span>

symbols, the mystical Tau, 'the bidden wisdom,' not only of the ancient
Egyptians but also of the Chaldeans, Phœnicians, Mexicans, Peruvians,
and of every other ancient people commemorated in history, in either
hemisphere, and is formed very similarly to our letter **T**, with a
roundlet, or oval, placed immediately above it. Thus it was figured

on the gigantic emerald or glass statue of Serapis, which was
transported (293 B.C.) by order of Ptolemy Soter from Sinope, on the
southern shores of the Black Sea, re-erected within that famous
labyrinth which encompassed the banks of Lake Mœris, and destroyed by
the victorious army of Theodosius (A.D. 389), despite the earnest
entreaties of the Egyptian priesthood to spare it, because it was the
emblem of their god and of 'the life to come.' Sometimes, as may be seen
on the breast of an Egyptian mummy in the museum of the London
University, the simple **T** only is planted on the frustum of a cone;
and sometimes it is represented as springing from a heart; in the first
instance signifying goodness; in the second, hope or expectation of
reward. As in the oldest temples <span id="img_31901"></span>

and catacombs of Egypt, so this type likewise abounds in the ruined
cities of Mexico and Central America, graven as well upon the most
ancient cyclopean and polygonal walls as upon the more modern and
perfect examples of masonry; and is displayed in an equally conspicuous
manner upon the breasts of innumerable bronze statuettes which have been
recently disinterred from the cemetery of Juigalpa (of unknown
antiquity) in Nicaragua."

When the Spanish missionaries first set foot upon the soil of America,
in the fifteenth century, they were amazed to find the Cross was as
devoutly worshipped by the red Indians as by themselves, and were in
doubt whether to ascribe the fact to the pious labors of St. Thomas or
to the cunning device of the Evil One. The hallowed symbol challenged
their attention

<span id="page_320">p. 320</span>

<table data-align="LEFT">

on every hand and in almost every variety of form. It appeared on the
bass-reliefs of ruined and deserted as well as on those of inhabited
palaces, and was the most conspicuous ornament in the great temple of
Gozumel, off the coast of Yucatan. According to the particular locality,
and the purpose which it served, it was formed of various materials--of
marble and gypsum in the open spaces of cities and by the way-side; of
wood in the teocallis or chapels on pyramidal summits and in
subterranean sanctuaries; and of emerald or jasper in the palaces of
kings and nobles.

When we ask the question how it comes that the sign of the Cross has
thus been reverenced. from the highest antiquity by the races of the Old
and New Worlds, we learn <span id="img_32001"></span>

that it is a reminiscence of the Garden of Eden, in other words, of
Atlantis.

Professor Hardwicke says:

"All these and similar traditions are but mocking satires of the old
Hebrew story--jarred and broken notes of the same strain; but with all
their exaggerations they intimate how in the background of man's vision
lay a paradise of holy joy--a paradise secured from every kind of
profanation, and made <span id="img_32002"></span>

inaccessible to the guilty; a paradise full of objects that were
calculated to delight the senses and to elevate the mind a paradise that
granted to its tenant rich and rare immunities, and that fed with its
perennial streams the tree of life and immortality."

To quote again from the writer in the *Edinburgh Review*, already cited:

<span id="page_321">p. 321</span>

"Its undoubted antiquity, no less than its extraordinary diffusion,
evidences that it must have been, as it may be said to be still in
unchristianized lands, emblematical of some fundamental doctrine or
mystery. The reader will not have failed to observe that it is most
usually associated with water; it was 'the key of the Nile,' that
mystical instrument by means of which, in the popular judgment of his
Egyptian devotees, Osiris produced the annual revivifying inundations of
the sacred stream; it is discernible in that mysterious pitcher or vase
portrayed on the brazen table of Bembus, before-mentioned, with its four
lips discharging as many streams of water in opposite directions; it was
the emblem of the water-deities of the Babylonians in the East and of
the Gothic nations in the West, a

ANCIENT IRISH CROSS--PRE-CHRISTIAN--KILNABOY.

 

well as that of the rain-deities respectively of the mixed population in
America. We have seen with what peculiar rites the symbol was honored by
those widely separated races in the western hemisphere; and the
monumental slabs of Nineveh, now in the museums of London and Paris,
show us how it was similarly honored by the successors of the Chaldees
in the eastern. . . .

"In Egypt, Assyria, and Britain it was emblematical of creative power
and eternity; in India, China, and Scandinavia, of heaven and
immortality; in the two Americas, of rejuvenescence and freedom from
physical suffering; while in both hemispheres it was the common symbol
of the resurrection, or 'the sign of the life to come;' and, finally, in
all heathen communities,

<span id="page_322">p. 322</span>

without exception, it was the emphatic type, the sole enduring evidence,
of the Divine Unity. This circumstance alone determines its extreme
antiquity--an antiquity, in all likelihood, long antecedent to the
foundation of either of the three great systems of religion in the East.
And, lastly, we have seen how, as a rule, it is found in conjunction
with a stream or streams of water, with exuberant vegetation, and with a
bill or a mountainous region--in a word, *with a land of beauty,
fertility, and joy*. Thus it was expressed upon those circular and
sacred cakes of the Egyptians, composed of the richest materials-of
flour, of honey, of milk--and with which the serpent <span

and bull, as well as other reptiles and beasts consecrated to the
service of Isis and their higher divinities, were daily fed; and upon
certain festivals were eaten with extraordinary ceremony by the people
and their priests. 'The cross-cake,' says Sir Gardner Wilkinson, 'was
their hieroglyph for civilized land;' obviously *a land superior to
their own, as it was, indeed, to all other mundane territories*; for it
was that *distant, traditional country of sempiternal contentment and
repose*, of exquisite delight and serenity, where Nature, unassisted by
man, produces all that is necessary for his sustentation."

And this land was the Garden of Eden of our race. This was the Olympus
of the Greeks, where

"This same mild season gives the blooms to blow,  
The buds to harden and the fruits to grow."

In the midst of it was a sacred and glorious eminence--the *umbilicus
orbis terrarum*--"toward which the heathen in all parts of the world,
and in all ages, turned a wistful gaze in every act of devotion, and to
which they hoped to be admitted, or, rather, to be restored, at the
close of this transitory scene."

In this "glorious eminence" do we not see Plato's mountain in the middle
of Atlantis, as he describes it:

"Near the plain and in the centre of the island there was a mountain,
not very high on any side. In this mountain there dwelt one of the
earth-born primeval men of that country,

<span id="page_323">p. 323</span>

whose name was Evenor, and he had a wife named Leucippe, and they had an
only daughter, who was named Cleito. Poseidon married her. He enclosed
the hill in which she dwelt all around, making alternate zones of sea
and land, larger and smaller, encircling one another; there were two of
land and three of water . . . so that no man could get to the island. .
. . He brought streams of water under the earth to this mountain-island,
and made all manner of food to grow upon it. This island became the seat
of Atlas, the over-king of the whole island; upon it they built the
great temple of their nation; they continued to ornament it in
successive generations, every king surpassing the one who came before
him to the utmost of his power, until they made the building a marvel to
behold for size and beauty. . . . And they had such an amount of wealth
as was never before possessed by kings and potentates--as is not likely
ever to be again."

The gardens of Alcinous and Laertes, of which we read in Homeric song,
and those of Babylon, were probably transcripts of Atlantis. "The sacred
eminence in the midst of a 'superabundant, happy region figures more or
less distinctly in a\]most every mythology, ancient or modern. It was
the Mesomphalos of the earlier Greeks, and the Omphalium of the Cretans,
dominating the Elysian fields, upon whose tops, bathed in pure,
brilliant, incomparable light, the gods passed their days in ceaseless
joys."

"The Buddhists and Brahmans, who together constitute nearly half the
population of the world, tell us that the decussated figure (the cross),
whether in a simple or a complex form, symbolizes the traditional happy
abode of their primeval ancestors--that 'Paradise of Eden toward the
East,' as we find expressed in the Hebrew. And, let us ask, what better
picture, or more significant characters, in the complicated alphabet of
symbolism, could have been selected for the purpose than a circle and a
cross: the one to denote a region of absolute purity and perpetual
felicity; the other, those four perennial streams that divided and
watered the several quarters of it?" (*Edinburgh Review*, January,
1870.)

And when we turn to the mythology of the Greeks, we find

<span id="page_324">p. 324</span>

that the origin of the world was ascribed to *Okeanos*, the ocean, The
world was at first an island surrounded by the ocean, as by a great
stream:

"It was a region of wonders of all kinds; Okeanos lived there with his
wife Tethys: these were the Islands of the Blessed, the gardens of the
gods, the sources of nectar and ambrosia, on which the gods lived.
Within this *circle of water* the earth lay spread out like a disk,
*with mountains rising from it*, and the vault of heaven appearing to
rest upon its outer edge all around." (Murray's "Manual of Mythology,"
pp. 23, 24, *et seq.*)

On the mountains dwelt the gods; they had palaces on these mountains,
with store-rooms, stabling, etc.

"The Gardens of the Hesperides, with their golden apples, were believed
to exist i*n some island of the ocean*, or, as it was sometimes thought,
*in the islands* off the north or *west coast of Africa*. They were far
famed in antiquity; for it was there that springs of nectar flowed by
the couch of Zeus, and there that the earth displayed the rarest
blessings of the gods; it was another Eden." (*Ibid.*, p. 156.)

Homer described it in these words:

"Stern winter smiles on that auspicious clime,  
The fields are florid with unfading prime,  
From the bleak pole no winds inclement blow.  
Mould the round hail, or flake the fleecy snow;  
But from the breezy deep the blessed inhale  
The fragrant murmurs of the western gale."

"It was the sacred Asgard of the Scandinavians, springing from the
centre of a fruitful land, which was watered by *four* primeval rivers
of milk, severally flowing in the direction of the cardinal points, 'the
abode of happiness, and the height of bliss.' It is the Tien-Chan, 'the
celestial mountain-land, . . . the enchanted gardens' of the Chinese and
Tartars, watered by the four perennial fountains of Tychin, or
Immortality; it is the hill-encompassed Ilá of the Singhalese and
Thibetians, 'the everlasting dwelling-place of the wise and just.' It is
the Sineru of the Buddhist, on the summit of which is Tawrutisa, the
habitation of Sekrá, the supreme god, from which proceed the *four
sacred streams*, running in as many contrary directions.

<span id="page_325">p. 325</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> It is the
Slávratta, 'the celestial earth,' of the Hindoo, the summit of his
golden mountain *Meru*, the city of Brahma, in the centre of
Jamba*d*wípa, and from the four sides of which gush forth the *four
primeval rivers*, reflecting in their passage the colorific glories of
their source, and severally flowing northward, southward, eastward, and
westward."

It is the Garden of Eden of the Hebrews:

"And the Lord God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there he put
the man whom he had formed. And out of the ground made the Lord God to
grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the
tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge
of good and evil. And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and
from thence it was parted, and became into *four* heads. The name of the
first is Pison; that is it which compasseth the whole land of Havilah,
where there is gold; and the gold of that land is good: there is
bdellium and the onyx stone. And the name of the second river is Gihon:
the same is it that compasseth the whole land of Ethiopia. And the name
of the third river is Hiddekel: that is it which goeth toward the east
of Assyria. And the fourth river is Euphrates. And the Lord God took the
man and put him into the Garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it."
(Gen. ii., 8-1-5.)

As the four rivers named in Genesis are not branches of any one stream,
and head in very different regions, it is evident that there was an
attempt, on the part of the writer of the Book, to adapt an ancient
tradition concerning another country to the known features of the region
in which be dwelt.

Josephus tells us (chap. i., p. 41), "Now the garden (of Eden) was
watered by one river, *which ran round about the whole earth*, and was
parted into four parts." Here in the four parts we see the origin of the
Cross, while in the river running around the whole earth we have the
wonderful canal of Atlantis, described by Plato, which was "carried
around the whole of the plain," and received the streams which came down
from the mountains. The streams named by Josephus would seem to
represent the migrations of people from Atlantis to its colonies.

<span id="page_356">p. 356</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> "Phison," he tells
us, "denotes a multitude; it ran into India; the Euphrates and Tigris go
down into the Red Sea while the Geon runs through Egypt."

We are further told (chap. ii., p. 42) that when Cain, after the murder
of. Abel, left the land of Adam, "he travelled over many countries"
before be reached the land of Nod; *and the land of Nod was to the
eastward of Adam's home*. In other words, the original seat of mankind
was in the West, that is to say, in the direction of Atlantis. Wilson
tells us that the Aryans of India believed that they originally came
"from the West." Thus the nations on the west of the Atlantic look to
the *east* for their place of origin; while on the east of the Atlantic
they look to the *west*: thus all the lines of tradition converge upon
Atlantis.

But here is the same testimony that in the Garden of Eden there were
four rivers radiating from one parent stream. And these four rivers, as
we have seen, we find in the Scandinavian traditions, and in the legends
of the Chinese, the Tartars, the Singhalese, the Thibetians, the
Buddhists, the Hebrews, and the Brahmans.

And not only do we find this tradition of the Garden of Eden in the Old
World, but it meets us also among the civilized races of America. The
elder Montezuma said to Cortez, "Our fathers dwelt in that happy and
prosperous place which they called Aztlan, which means *whiteness*. . .
. In this place *there is a great mountain in the middle of the water*
which is called Culhuacan, because it has the point somewhat turned over
toward the bottom; and for this cause it is called Culhuacan, which
means 'crooked mountain.'" He then proceeds to describe the charms of
this favored land, abounding in birds, game, fish, trees, "fountains
enclosed with elders and junipers, and alder-trees both large and
beautiful." The people planted "maize, red peppers, tomatoes, beans, and
all kinds of plants, *in furrows*."

Here we have the same mountain in the midst of the water

<span id="page_327">p. 327</span>

which Plato describes--the same mountain to which all the legends of the
most ancient races of Europe refer.

The inhabitants of Aztlan were *boatmen*. (Bancroft's "Native Races,"
vol. v., p. 325.) E. G. Squier, in his "Notes on Central America," p.
349, says, "It is a significant fact that in the map of their
migrations, presented by Gemelli, the place of the origin of the Aztecs
is designated by the sign of water, *Atl* standing for *Atzlan*, a
*pyramidal temple* with grades, and near these a palm-tree." This
circumstance did not escape the attention of Humboldt, who says, I am
astonished at finding a palm-tree near this teocalli. This tree
certainly does not indicate a northern origin. . . . The possibility
that an unskilful artist should unintentionally represent a tree of
which he had no knowledge is so great, that any argument dependent on it
hangs upon a slender thread." ("North Americans of Antiquity," p. 266.)

The Miztecs, a tribe dwelling on the outskirts of Mexico, had a
tradition that the gods, "in the day of obscurity and darkness," built
"a sumptuous palace, a masterpiece of skill, in which they male their
abode upon a mountain. The rock was called 'The Place of Heaven;' there
the gods first abode on earth, living many years in great rest and
content, as in a happy and delicious land, though the world still lay in
obscurity and darkness. The children of these gods made to themselves a
garden, in which they put many trees, and fruit-trees, and flowers, and
roses, and odorous herbs. Subsequently there came a great deluge, in
which many of the sons and daughters of the gods perished." (Bancroft's
"Native Races," vol. iii., p. 71.) Here we have a distinct reference to
Olympus, the Garden of Plato, and the destruction of Atlantis.

And in Plato's account of Atlantis we have another description of the
Garden of Eden and the Golden Age of the world:

"Also, whatever fragrant things there are in the earth, whether roots,
or herbage, or woods, or distilling drops of flowers and fruits, grew
and thrived in that land; and again the cultivated

<span id="page_328">p. 328</span>

fruits of the earth, both the edible fruits and other species of food
which we call by the name of legumes, and the fruits having a hard rind,
affording drinks and meats and ointments . . . all these that sacred
island, lying beneath the sun, brought forth in abundance. . . . For
many generations, as long as the divine nature lasted in them, they were
obedient to the laws, and well affectioned toward the gods, who were
their kinsmen; for they possessed true and in every way great spirits,
practising gentleness and wisdom in the various chances of life, and in
their intercourse with one another. They despised everything but virtue,
not caring for their present state of life, and thinking lightly of the
possession of gold and other property, which seemed only a burden to
them; neither were they intoxicated by luxury; nor did wealth deprive
them of their self-control; but they were sober, and saw clearly that
all these goods were increased by virtuous friendship with one another,
and that by excessive zeal for them, and honor of them, the good of them
is lost, and friendship perishes with them."

All this cannot be a mere coincidence; it points to a common tradition
of a veritable land, where four rivers flowed down in opposite
directions from a central mountain-peak. And these four rivers, flowing
to the north, south, east, and west, constitute the origin of that sign
of the Cross which we have seen meeting us at every point among the
races who were either descended from the people of Atlantis, or who, by
commerce and colonization, received their opinions and civilization from
them.

Let us look at the question of the identity of the Garden of Eden with
Atlantis from another point of view:

If the alphabet of the Phœnicians is kindred with the Maya alphabet, as
I think is clear, then the Phœnicians were of the same race, or of some
race with which the Mayas were connected; in other words, they were from
Atlantis.

Now we know that the Phœnicians and Hebrews were of the same stock, used
the same alphabet, and spoke almost precisely the same language.

The Phœnicians preserved traditions, which have come down

<span id="page_329">p. 329</span>

to us in the writings, of Sanchoniathon, of all the great essential
inventions or discoveries which underlie civilization. The first two
human beings, they tell us, were Protogonos and Aion (Adam and 'Havath),
who produce Genos and Genea (Qên and Qênath), from whom again are
descended three brothers, named Phos, Phur, and Phlox (Light, Fire, and
Flame), because they "have discovered how to produce fire by the
friction of two pieces of wood, and have taught the use of this
element." In another fragment, at the origin of the human race we see in
succession the fraternal couples of Autochthon and Technites (Adam and
Quen--Cain?), inventors of the manufacture of bricks; Agros and Agrotes
(Sade and Cêd), fathers of the agriculturists and hunters; then Amynos
and Magos, "who taught to dwell in villages and rear flocks."

The connection between these Atlantean traditions and the Bible record
is shown in many things. For instance, "the Greek text, in expressing
the invention of Amynos, uses the words κώμας καὶ ποίμνας, which are
precisely the same as the terms *ôhel umiqneh*, which the Bible uses in
speaking of the dwellings of the descendants of Jabal (Gen., chap. iv.,
v. 20). In like manner Lamech, both in the signification of his name and
also iv the savage character attributed to him by the legend attached to
his memory, is a true synonyme of Agrotes."

"And the title of Ἀλῆται, given to Agros and Agrotes in the Greek of the
Phœnician history, fits in wonderfully with the physiognomy of the race
of the Cainites in the Bible narrative, whether we take Ἀλῆται simply as
a Hellenized transcription of the Semitic *Elim*, 'the strong, the
mighty,' or whether we take it in its Greek acceptation, 'the
wanderers;' for such is the destiny of Cain and his race according to
the very terms of the condemnation which was inflicted upon him after
his crime (Gen. iv., 14), and this is what is signified by the name of
his grandson 'Yirad. Only, in Sanchoniathon the genealogy does not end
with Amynos and Magos, as that of the Cainites in the Bible does with
the three sons of Lamech. These two personages are succeeded by Misôr
and Sydyk, 'the released and the

<span id="page_330">p. 330</span>

just,' as Sanchoniathon translates them, but rather the 'upright and the
just' (Mishôr and Çüdüq), 'who invent the use of salt.' To Misôr is born
Taautos (Taût), to whom we owe letters; and to Sydyk the Cabiri or
Corybantes, the institutors of navigation." (Lenormant, "Genealogies
between Adam and the Deluge." *Contemporary Review*, April, 1880.)

We have, also, the fact that the Phœnician name for their goddess
Astynome (Ashtar No'emâ), whom the Greeks called Nemaun, was the same as
the name of the sister of the three sons of Lamech, as given in
Genesis--Na'emah, or Na'amah.

If, then, the original seat of the Hebrews and Phœnicians was the Garden
of Eden, to the west of Europe, and if the Phœnicians are shown to be
connected, through their alphabets, with the Central Americans, who
looked to an island in the sea, to the eastward, as their
starting-point, the conclusion becomes irresistible that Atlantis and
the Garden of Eden were one and the same.

The Pyramid.--Not only are the Cross and the Garden of Eden identified
with Atlantis, but in Atlantis, the habitation of the gods, we find the
original model of all those pyramids which extend from India to Peru.

This singular architectural construction dates back far beyond the birth
of history. In the *Purânas* of the Hindoos we read of pyramids long
anterior in time to any which have survived to our day. Cheops was
preceded by a countless host of similar erections which have long since
mouldered into ruins.

If the reader will turn to page 104 of this work he will see, in the
midst of the picture of Aztlan, the starting-point of the Aztecs,
according to the Botturini pictured writing, a pyramid with worshippers
kneeling before it.

Fifty years ago Mr. Faber, in his "Origin of Pagan Idolatry," placed
artificial tumuli, pyramids, and pagodas in the same category,
conceiving that all were transcripts of the holy mountain which was
generally supposed to have stood in the centre of Eden; or, rather. as
intimated in more than one place by

<span id="page_331">p. 331</span>

the Psalmist, the garden itself was situated on an eminence. (Psalms,
chap. iii., v. 4, and chap. lxviii., vs. 15, 16, 18.)

The pyramid is one of the marvellous features of that problem which
confronts us everywhere, and which is insoluble without Atlantis.

The Arabian traditions linked the pyramid with the Flood. In a
manuscript preserved in the Bodleian Library, and translated by Dr.
Sprenger, Abou Balkhi says:

"The wise men, *previous to the Flood*, foreseeing an impending Judgment
from heaven, either by submersion or fire, which would destroy every
created thing, built upon the tops of the mountains in Upper Egypt many
pyramids of stone, in order to have some refuge against the approaching
calamity. Two of these buildings exceeded the rest in height, being four
hundred cubits, high and as many broad and as many long. They were built
with large blocks of marble, and they were so well put together that the
joints were scarcely perceptible. Upon the exterior of the building
every charm and wonder of physic was inscribed."

This tradition locates these monster structures upon the mountains of
Upper Egypt, but there are no buildings of such dimensions to be found
anywhere in Egypt. Is it not probable that we have here another
reference to the great record preserved in the land of the Deluge? Were
not the pyramids of Egypt and America imitations of similar structures
in Atlantis? Might not the building of such a gigantic edifice have
given rise to the legends existing on both continents in regard to a
Tower of Babel?

How did the human mind hit upon this singular edifice--the pyramid? By
what process of development did it reach it? Why should these
extraordinary structures crop out on the banks of the Nile, and amid the
forests and plains of America? And why, in both countries, should they
stand with their sides square to the four cardinal points of the
compass? Are they in this, too, a reminiscence of the Cross, and of the
four rivers of Atlantis that ran to the north, south, east, and west?

<span id="page_332">p. 332</span>

"There is yet a third combination that demands a specific notice. The
decussated symbol is not unfrequently planted upon what Christian
archæologists designate 'a calvary,' that is, upon a *mount* or a
*cone*. Thus it is represented in both hemispheres. The megalithic
structure of Callernish, in the island of Lewis before mentioned, is the
most perfect example of the practice extant in Europe. The mount is
preserved to this day. This, to be brief, was the recognized
conventional mode of expressing a particular primitive truth or mystery
from the days of the Chaldeans to those of the Gnostics, or from one
extremity of the civilized world to the other. It is seen in the
treatment of the ash Yggdrasill of the Scandinavians, as well as in that
of the Bo-tree of the Buddhists. The prototype was not the Egyptian, but
the Babylonian *crux ansata*, the lower member of which constitutes a
conical support for the oval or sphere above it. With the Gnostics, who
occupied the debatable ground between primitive Christianity and
philosophic paganism, and who inscribed it upon their tombs, the cone
symbolized death as well as life. In every heathen mythology it was the
universal emblem of the goddess or mother of heaven, by whatsoever name
she was addressed--whether as Mylitta, Astarte, Aphrodite, Isis, Mata,
or Venus; and the several eminences consecrated to her worship were,
like those upon which Jupiter was originally adored, of a conical or
pyramidal shape. This, too, is the ordinary form of the altars dedicated
to the Assyrian god of fertility. In exceptional instances the cone is
introduced upon one or the other of the sides, or is distinguishable in
the always accompanying mystical tree." (*Edinburgh Review*, July,
1870.)

If the reader will again turn to page 104 of this work he will see that
the tree appears on the top of the pyramid or mountain in both the Aztec
representations of Aztlan, the original island-home of the Central
American races.

The writer just quoted believes that Mr. Faber is correct in his opinion
that the pyramid is a transcript of the sacred mountain which stood in
the midst of Eden, the Olympus of Atlantis. He adds:

"Thomas Maurice, who is no mean authority, held the same view. He
conceived the use to which pyramids in particular

<span id="page_333">p. 333</span>

were anciently applied to have been threefold--namely, as tombs,
temples, and observatories; and this view he labors to establish in the
third volume of his 'Indian Antiquities.' Now, whatever may be their
actual date, or with whatsoever people they may have originated, whether
in Africa or Asia, in the lower valley of the Nile or in the plains of
Chaldea, the pyramids of Egypt were unquestionably destined to very
opposite purposes. According, to Herodotus, they were introduced by the
Hyksos; and Proclus, the Platonic philosopher, connects them with the
science of astronomy--a science which, he adds, the Egyptians derived
from the Chaldeans. Hence we may reasonably infer that they served as
well for temples for planetary worship as for observatories.
Subsequently to the descent of the shepherds, their hallowed precincts
were invaded by royalty, from motives of pride and superstition; and the
principal chamber in each was used as tombs."

The pyramidal imitations, dear to the hearts of colonists of the sacred
mountain upon which their gods dwelt, was devoted, as perhaps the
mountain itself was, to sun and fire worship. The same writer says:

"That Sabian worship once extensively prevailed in the New World is a
well-authenticated fact; it is yet practised to some extent by the
wandering tribes on the Northern continent, and was the national
religion of the Peruvians at the time of the Conquest. That it was also
the religion of their more highly civilized predecessors on the soil,
south of the equator more especially, is evidenced by the remains of
fire-altars, both round and square, scattered about the shores of lakes
Umayu and Titicaca, and which are the counterparts of the Gueber dokh
mehs overhanging the Caspian Sea. Accordingly, we find, among these and
other vestiges of antiquity that indissolubly connected those long-since
extinct populations in the New with the races of the Old World, the
well-defined symbol of the Maltese Cross. On the Mexican feroher before
alluded to, and which is most elaborately carved in bass-relief on a
massive piece of polygonous granite, constituting a portion of a
cyclopean wall, the cross is enclosed within the ring, and accompanying
it are four tassel-like ornaments, graved equally well. Those
accompaniments, however, are disposed without any particular

<span id="page_334">p. 334</span>

regard to order, but the four arms of the cross, nevertheless, severally
and accurately point to the cardinal quarters, The same regularity is
observable on a much smaller but not less curious monument, which was
discovered some time since in an ancient Peruvian huaca or
catacomb--namely, a syrinx or pandean pipe, cut out of a solid mass of
*lapis ollaris*, the sides of which are profusely ornamented, not only
with Maltese crosses, but also with other symbols very similar in style
to those inscribed on the obelisks of Egypt and on the monoliths of this
country. The like figure occurs on the equally ancient Otrusco black
pottery. But by far the most remarkable example of this form of the
Cross in the New World is that which appears on a second type of the
Mexican feroher, engraved on a tablet of gypsum, and which is described
at length by its discoverer, Captain du Paix, and depicted by his
friend, M. Baradère. Here the accompaniments--a shield, a hamlet, and a
couple of bead-annulets or rosaries--are, with a single exception,
identical in even the minutest particular with an Assyrian monument
emblematical of the Deity. . . .

"No country in the world can compare with India for the exposition of
the pyramidal cross. There the stupendous labors of Egypt are rivalled,
and sometimes surpassed. Indeed, but for the fact of such monuments of
patient industry and unexampled skill being still in existence, the
accounts of some others which have long since disappeared, having
succumbed to the ravages of time and the fury of the bigoted Mussulman,
would sound in our ears as incredible as the story of Porsenna's tomb,
which 'o'ertopped old Pelion,' and made 'Ossa like a wart.' Yet
something not very dissimilar in character to it was formerly the boast
of the ancient city of Benares, on the banks of the Ganges. We allude to
the great temple of Bindh Madhu, which was demolished in the seventeenth
century by the Emperor Aurungzebe. Tavernier, the French baron, who
travelled thither about the year 1680, has preserved a brief description
of it. The body of the temple was constructed in the figure of a
colossal cross (*i. e.*, a St. Andrew's Cross), with a lofty dome at the
centre, above which rose a massive structure of a pyramidal form. At the
four extremities of the cross there were four other pyramids of
proportionate dimensions, and which were ascended from the outside by
steps, with balconies at stated distances for places of rest, reminding
us of the temple

<span id="page_335">p. 335</span>

of Belus, as described in the pages of Herodotus. The remains of a
similar building are found at Mhuttra, on the banks of the Jumna. This
and many others, including the subterranean temple at Elephanta and the
caverns of Ellora and Salsette, are described at length in the
well-known work by Maurice; who adds that, besides these, there was yet
another device in which the Hindoo displayed the all-pervading sign;
this was by pyramidal towers placed crosswise. At the famous temple of
Chillambrum, on the Coromandel coast, there were seven lofty walls, one
within the other, round the central quadrangle, and as many pyramidal
gate-ways in the midst of each side which forms the limbs of a vast
cross."

In Mexico pyramids were found everywhere. Cortez, in a letter to Charles
V., states that he counted four hundred of them at Cholula. Their
temples were on those "high-places." The most ancient pyramids in Mexico
are at Teotihuacan, eight leagues from the city of Mexico; the two
largest were dedicated to the sun and moon respectively, each built of
cut stone, with a level area at the summit, and four stages leading up
to it. The larger one is 680 feet square at the base, about 200 feet
high, and covers an area of eleven acres. The Pyramid of Cholula,
measured by Humboldt, is 160 feet high, 1400 feet square at the base,
and covers forty five acres! The great pyramid of Egypt, Cheops, is 746
feet square, 450 feet high, and covers between twelve and thirteen
acres. So that it appears that the base of the Teotihuacan structure is
nearly as large as that of Cheops, while that of Cholula covers nearly
four times as much space. The Cheops pyramid, however, exceeds very much
in height both the American structures.

Señor Garcia y Cubas thinks the pyramids of Teotihuacan (Mexico) were
built for the same purpose as those of Egypt. He considers the analogy
established in eleven particulars, as follows: 1, the site chosen is the
same; 2, the structures are orientated with slight variation; 3, the
line through the centres of the structures is in the astronomical
meridian; 4, the

<span id="page_336">p. 336</span>

construction in grades and steps is the same; 5, in both cases the
larger pyramids are dedicated to the sun; 6, the Nile has "a valley of
the dead," as in Teotihuacan there is "a street of the dead;" 7, some
monuments in each class have the nature of fortifications; 8, the
smaller mounds are of the same nature and for the same purpose; 9, both
pyramids have a small mound joined to one of their faces; 10, the
openings discovered in the Pyramid of the Moon are also found in some
Egyptian pyramids; 11, the interior arrangements of the pyramids are
analogous. ("Ensayo de un Estudio.")

It is objected that the American edifices are different in form from the
Egyptian, in that they are truncated, or flattened at the top; but this
is not an universal rule.

"In many of the ruined cities of Yucatan one or more pyramids have been
found upon the summit of which no traces of any building could be
discovered, although upon surrounding pyramids such structures could be
found. There is also some reason to believe that perfect pyramids have
been found in America. Waldeck found near Palenque two pyramids in a
state of perfect preservation, square at the base, pointed at the top,
and thirty-one feet high, their sides forming equilateral triangles."
(Bancroft's Native Races," vol. v., p. 58.)

Bradford thinks that some of the Egyptian pyramids, and those which with
some reason it has been supposed are the most ancient, are precisely
similar to the Mexican *teocalli*." ("North Americans of Antiquity" p.
423.)

And there is in Egypt another form of pyramid called the *mastaba*,
which, like the Mexican, was flattened on the top; while in Assyria
structures flattened like the Mexican are found. "In fact," says one
writer, "this form of temple (the flat-topped) has been found from
Mesopotamia to the Pacific Ocean." The Phœnicians also built pyramids.
In the thirteenth century the Dominican Brocard visited the ruins of the
Phœnician city of Mrith or Marathos, and speaks in the strongest terms
of admiration of those pyramids of surprising grandeur, constructed of
blocks of stone from twenty-six to twenty-eight

<span id="page_337">p. 337</span>

feet long, whose thickness exceeded the stature of a tall man.
("Prehistoric Nations," p. 144.)

"If," says Ferguson, "we still hesitate to pronounce that there was any
connection between the builders of the pyramids of Suku and Oajaca, or
the temples of Xochialco and Boro Buddor, we must at least allow that
the likeness is startling, and difficult to account for on the theory of
mere accidental coincidence."

The Egyptian pyramids all stand with their sides to the cardinal

PYRAMIDS OF EGYPT.

 

points, while many of the Mexican pyramids do likewise. The Egyptian
pyramids were penetrated by small passage-ways; so were the Mexican. The
Pyramid of Teotihuacan, according to Almarez, has, at a point sixty-nine
feet from the base, a gallery large enough to admit a man crawling on
hands and knees,

<span id="page_338">p. 338</span>

which extends, inward, on an incline, a distance of twenty feet, and
terminates in two square wells or chambers, each five feet square and
one of them fifteen feet deep. Mr. Löwenstern

 

<span id="img_33800"></span> ![](img/33800.jpg)  
PYRAMIDS OF TEOTIHUACAN.

 

states, according to Mr. Bancroft ("Native Races," vol. iv., p. 533),
that "the gallery is one hundred and fifty-seven feet long, increasing
in height to over six feet and a half as it penetrates the pyramid; that
the well is over six feet square, extending (apparently) down to the
base and up to the summit; and that other cross-galleries are blocked up
by débris." In the Pyramid of Cheops there is a similar opening or
passage-way forty-nine feet above the base; it is three feet eleven
inches high, and three feet five and a half inches wide; it leads down a
slope to a sepulchral chamber or well, and connects with other
passage-ways leading up into the body of the pyramid.

THE GREAT MOUND, NEAR MIAMISBURG, OHIO.

 

In both the Egyptian the American pyramids the outside of the structures
was covered with a thick coating of smooth, shining cement.

Humboldt considered the Pyramid of Cholula of the same type as the
Temple of Jupiter Belus, the pyramids of Meidoun Dachhour, and the group
of Sakkarah, in Egypt.

 

<span id="img_34100"></span> ![](img/34100.jpg)  
GREAT PYRAMID OF XCOCH, MEXICO.

 

In both America and Egypt the pyramids were used as places of sepulture;
and it is a remarkable fact that the system of earthworks and mounds,
kindred to the pyramids, is found even in England. Silsbury Hill, at
Avebury, is an artificial mound *one hundred and seventy feet high*. It
is connected with ramparts, avenues (fourteen hundred and eighty yards

<span id="page_342">p. 342</span>

long), circular ditches, and stone circles, almost identical with those
found in the valley of the Mississippi. In Ireland the dead were buried
in vaults of stone, and the earth raised over them in pyramids flattened
on the top. They were called "moats" by the people. We have found the
stone vaults at the base of similar truncated pyramids in Ohio. There
can be no doubt that the pyramid was a developed and perfected mound,
and that the parent form of these curious structures is to be found in
Silsbury Hill, and in the mounds of earth of Central America and the
Mississippi Valley.

We find the emblem of the Cross in pre-Christian times venerated as a
holy symbol on both sides of the Atlantic; and we find it explained as a
type of the four rivers of the happy island where the civilization of
the race originated.

We find everywhere among the European and American nations the memory of
an Eden of the race, where the first men dwelt in primeval peace and
happiness, and which was afterward destroyed by water.

We find the pyramid on both sides of the Atlantic, with its four sides
pointing, like the arms of the Cross, to the four cardinal points-a
reminiscence of Olympus; and in the Aztec representation of Olympos
(Aztlan) we find the pyramid as the central and typical figure.

Is it possible to suppose all these extraordinary coincidences to be the
result of accident? We might just as well say that the similarities
between the American and English forms of government were not the result
of relationship or descent, but that men placed in similar circumstances
had spontaneously and necessarily reached the same results.
