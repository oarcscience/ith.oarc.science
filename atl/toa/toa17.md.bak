“WHY “TIME-LOST?”

During the first half of the Twentieth Century, the popular fiction
magazines of the day—the "pulps"—played a major role in the development
of new writing talents. They were a perfect apprenticeship for the young
author, and a means of supplying a thirsty public with escape
literature. Of the thousands of stories written for the pulps in this
era, a respectable number went into book form.

Today, however, these stories are, in part, forgotten. Castaways of
time… "Time-Lost."

After many years of research, the editors of Centaur Press have selected
the best of these and fitted them into a new series. The stories
themselves have defied time, and somehow have a flavor that is generally
missing from contemporary fiction. This is another dimension of writing.
Here is a high adventure series with direction!

WHAT ARE "TIME-LOST" BOOKS?

The basic premise of "Time-Lost" books is swashbuckling high adventure
and heroic action. The setting is almost always in a realm that is
strange to civilization. It may be the fearsome jungle of Brazil,
flavored by the fertile imagination of Arthur O. Friel as in THE
PATHLESS TRAIL. Or it may be the sword and sorcery exploits of Solomon
Kane in Atlantean Negari as in Robert E. Howard's THE MOON OF SKULLS.
