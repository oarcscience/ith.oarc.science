# CHAPTER XVII

### RAI NI INCAL--ASHES TO ASHES

On a bier in front of the Holy Seat, by the eastern face of the
Maxin-Stone in the Incalithlon, lay all that was of the earth, earthy of
Ernon of Suernis. In the triangle were gathered a few witnesses asked by
Rai Gwauxln to be present, and

<span id="page_165">p. 165</span>

over all shone the mysterious light which required no fuel, nor for its
tall taper any human keeper. High above, hung the white stalactite
ceiling, casting down from its many points the radiance of the lights
which no one could see from below.

"Close his eyes, his work is done."

Beside the restful form stood Mainin, the Incaliz, his hand on the
shoulder of the dead Rai. After the mighty organ had sounded a mournful
requiem, Mainin made the funeral speech, saying:

"Once more has a most noble soul known earth. How hath it treated him
who gave his life to the service of its children? Verily, Suerna, thou
hast done a deed which shall clothe thee in sackcloth and ashes for aye!
Ernon, my brother, Son of the Solitude, we bid thee adieu in great
sorrow of soul; sorrow not for thee, for thou art at rest; but for us
left behind. It shall be until many years ere we know thee again
incarnate. As for this, thy poor clay, over it we will say final words,
for it hath done its work and is committed to Navazzamin. Ernon,
brother, peace be with thee evermore."

Again the mighty organ played in solemn sadness, and while attendants
raised the bier upon the cube of the Maxin, the Incaliz raised his hands
to heaven and said:

"Unto Incal this soul, unto earth this clay."

The body, bound with light bands to the bier, was raised with it to an
erect posture, trembled a moment in that position, and fell forward into
the Maxin. There was no flame, no smoke, not even ash left behind the
instantaneous disappearance of body and bed.

The funeral was over. As we who abode in Caiphul turned to depart, we.
saw that which no man then living had ever before beheld in the
Incalithlon. Back of us, in the auditorium, stood groups of grey-habited
men, cowled like monks of Rome. There seemed great numbers of them,
collected in groups of seven or eight amongst the maze of stalagmite
pillars which supported the roof. As we gazed, these men faded slowly
from sight, until over four score of Caiphalians seemed indeed small in
number in the vast hall where so recently had

<span id="page_166">p. 166</span>

been hundreds of Incaleni, Sons of the Solitude in astral form, gathered
at the funeral of their brother. Yea, verily, had the Sons come to
witness the impressive ceremony where all that was mortal of their dead
fellow was restored to the keeping of the elements of nature.

"But no man knows that sepulcher,  
    And no man saw it e'er,  
For the angels of God upturned the sod  
    And laid the dead man there."
