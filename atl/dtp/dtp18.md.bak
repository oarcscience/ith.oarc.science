# CHAPTER XIV

### THE ADOPTION OF ZAILM

When, according to request, I arrived at the Agacoe palace on the next
morning, I proceeded directly to the private office there occupied by
Prince Menax, expecting to find my father

<span id="page_130">p. 130</span>

alone. But in this I was disappointed, as Rai Gwauxln was there with
him. The two were in conversation when I entered, and did not cease,
evidently not regarding me as an intruder. At last I heard the Rai ask:

"Should we not now go to the Incalithlon?"

"If it please thee. And thou, Zailm, accompany us."

A palace car was summoned by the Rai, and came rolling along into our
presence without any person to operate it; came in at the door of the
office, which opened to allow its passage precisely as if some court
page had opened it. It wheeled into the room and came to a stop in front
of us. All this was done exactly as if under a guiding hand. But no
visible hand was there. This was the first time I had ever seen any
exhibition of occult power on the part of Gwauxln; indeed I never saw
many examples of his power, notwithstanding his high adeptship. Like all
true adepts he was exceedingly chary of such object lessons, disliking
to show his knowledge before those not possessed of sufficient common
sense to know that any acts of the sort were but examples of the control
of nature through an understanding of higher laws than the ordinary mind
perceives in its natural surroundings; but I was not one who saw
anything miraculous in the occult; if I understood not the process, I
did understand that it was but the operation of some unfamiliar law.
Hence Gwauxln was not averse to allowing me to witness his power at
times.

The car conveyed us to the vailx-landing outside, where we found a vailx
of small size, into which Rai Gwauxln courteously assisted first Menax,
then myself, and himself entered last. Here was a spectacle worthy of
note, the ruler of a mighty nation without the display of a single
attendant, not more deferential to rank than to those of inferior
station. True, as a Xio-Incali, Gwauxln had command over mechanical
service which was more regal far than a retinue of menials could be.

Like father, like son. Gwauxln, who was as a father to his people, was
copied by them in his demeanor. They, too, were simple in habits,
courteous in manner, and, though in many

<span id="page_131">p. 131</span>

cases wealthy and luxurious in their habits in life, were entirely
unostentatious, as their Rai set them example.

The great temple of Incal was distant several miles, but a few minutes
sufficed to bring us to its huge structure. Outwardly the Incalithlon
was shaped like the Egyptian pyramid of Cheops, not quite so high, but
covering an area of twice as great extent. No windows pierced its sides,
and sunlight or that of day never entered its interior. Besides a number
of small apartments, the building contained one vast hall where was
space for several thousand worshipers. The Poseid habit of copying
nature was followed in this sanctuary with extraordinary faithfulness.
Instead of straight walls, or alcoves, or the ordinary arrangement of
interiors, the enormous auditorium was in faithful semblance of a cave
of stalactites and stalagmites. In placing all this calcite, utility was
consulted with regard to the stalagmites so that too much floor space
should not be occupied by them. But the stalactites, being pendent from
the marble ceiling, had been placed as thickly as space allowed and
sparkled like stars in the light from the incandescent lamps swung
midway between them and the floor below. From the latter point of view
these lamps were concealed by broad concave shades so that their glow
was wholly invisible from beneath, but shining upwards was reflected
from myriads of sparkling white needles, filling the temple with a
steady and. soft, but powerful, light that seemed to emanate from no
special point, but from the air itself, a light well adapted to
religious meditation.

We left the vailx and entered the unimposing but ample portal, and
proceeded across the hall to the Holy Seat, in the back of the
sanctuary. Within it we found Mainin, the Incaliz, or high priest, a man
of wondrous attainments of knowledge, second to none in fact. To him we
all made courteous obeisance, and then Prince Menax said:

"Most holy Incaliz, thou knowest, in thy great wisdom, upon what errand
thy sons have come before thee. Wilt thou fulfill our prayer by granting
us thy blessing?"

The Incaliz arose and bade us to follow him into the triangle

<span id="page_132">p. 132</span>

of the Maxin, or Divine Light, in front of the Holy Seat. Deferring the
relation of our subsequent action, I will describe this especially
sacred part of the temple. It was a raised, triangular platform of red
granite, several inches higher than the floor of the auditorium,
thirty-six feet between its points. In the very center of it was a large
block of crystal quartz, upon the perfect cube of which rose the Maxin.
This seemed aflame, in shape like a giant spearhead, and it cast a light
of intense power over all things around, yet one could look at its
steady, unwavering white glow without desiring shade for the eyes, even
though these were not strong. Over three times the height of a tall man
it stood, a mysterious manifestation of Incal, as all spectators
believed. In reality it was an occult odic light, and had stood in that
one spot for centuries. It had witnessed the grander development of
Poseid and its capital city, and had seen the original temple of Incal
(a small architectural structure, unworthy of a great people) torn down,
and the present Incalithlon built around it. It made no heat, did not
even warm the quartz pedestal; yet for any living being to touch it was
fatal in the instant of the rash act. No oil, no fuel, no electric
currents fed it; no man tended it. Its history was peculiar, and can not
fail to interest thee, my friends.

Many hundred years previously there had been for four hundred and
thirty-four days a ruler over the Poseidi who possessed wonderful
knowledge. This wisdom was like that of Ernon of Suern. No one knew
whence he came, and not a few were disposed to question his statement,
while all were in doubt, as to whether his meaning was figurative or
literal when he said:

"I am from Incal. Lo, I am a child of the Sun and am come to reform the
religion and life of this people. Behold Incal is the Father and I am
the Son, and He is in Me and I am in Him."

He was asked to prove this claim, whereupon be laid his hand upon a man
born blind, and the man received his sight and saw with the doubters
that his deliverer stooped to the pavement of the triangular platform,
and with his finger drew a

<span id="page_133">p. 133</span>

square five and a half feet either way. Then he stepped outside of the
lines indicated, and at once the great block of quartz appeared, a
perfect cube, in the place. Standing by its side he placed his finger
upon the rock, and blew thereon with his breath, As he withdrew the
finger the Maxin, or Fire of Incal, sprang up, and thus had cube and
Unfed Fire remained during all the centuries since.

It is needless to say the proof was satisfactory, and thereafter the
mysterious stranger revised the laws and provided then the code which
had ever since governed the land. He had said that whosoever should add
to or take from his laws, that person should not come into the Kingdom
of Incal until "I am come on earth for the final judgment."

No one had ever desired to disobey, it would seem, or at least no change
had ever been made. The laws which this Rai had given were written by
him with his finger upon the Maxin-Stone, and no work of sculptor's
chisel were better done. They were also written upon a book of parchment
leaves, and this he placed under the Unfed Light itself, which
thereafter sprang from the surface of the Book; this had remained ever
since, unharmed, unscorched. The wonderful writer had placed it there in
sight of all the people who could enter the new Temple built in place of
the old one. As he did so, he said:

"Hearken unto me. This is my law. Behold it also written on the
Maxin-Stone. No man shall remove it, lest he die. Yet after centuries
have flown, behold! the Book shall disappear in sight of a multitude,
and no man shall know its place. Then shall the Unfed Light go out, and
no man be able to rekindle it. And when these things have come to pass,
lo! the day is not far off when the land shall no more be. It shall
perish because of its iniquity, and the waters of Atl shall roll above
it! I have spoken."

Once, in the history of Poseid, a Rai had come to doubt whether a man
would surely die if he tried to withdraw the Book of the Unfed Light. He
conceived the idea that as the Maxin sprang from the top of the Book
alone, and not from its sides, that removal might be possible. So
therefore he

<span id="page_134">p. 134</span>

forced a malefactor to attempt the deed, fearing after all to try it
himself, although in the tyrannous policy which he followed, he cared
not whether the man died or not. That was a day of growing darkness and
wickedness, when men had somewhat forgotten the Great Rai, Son of Incal.
The unhappy wretch was made to grasp the Book, and withdraw it if he
could. He found it impossible to move it, but yet was not destroyed by
the Maxin. Grown bolder, and urged by the Rai, he tried harder. He
pulled, and then his grasp gave way, and one hand passed through the
Maxin. The member was instantly destroyed, cut off, gone, while the
monarch, standing many feet distant, fearful of approaching near, was
stricken in that same instant by an outleaping flash of the Maxin, and
no one ever saw him more!

That one example was sufficient! The error of their ways suddenly became
very apparent to the evil-doers, and administration of the laws was
again in accord with their spirit, as with their letter. The day of the
"Dismal Prophecy" had been looked for as the decades passed into
centuries, but its time was not yet come, and though many alarmists set
days when it would surely come, it came not, and the Unfed Light
continued. According to the law, bodies of all souls which had passed
into Navazzamin were cremated. This even included some animals. Those
dying at a distance from Caiphul were incinerated in some one of the
multitude of Navamaxa (furnaces especially for dead bodies) which the
government provided all through the provinces, and if the incinerated
body was that of a human being the ashes were taken to Caiphul and cast
into the Maxin, as a ceremonial act. Those of the departed from Caiphul
were taken as they lay in death to the Incalithlon, and being raised to
the top of the Cube, were let fall face forward into the Unfed Light. In
either case, whether as incinerated ashes or unaltered forms, the result
was the same; that is, while there was no flaming, no smoke, no tremor
of the Maxin, nevertheless the instantaneous disappearance of the object
occurred at the second of contact with the marvelous Unfed Fire.

<span id="page_135">p. 135</span>

Hence it had been sung by poets as the "Gateway" to the country which
each soul must discover for itself. To die, with out in some manner
passing into the Maxin, either in corpus personae or by the ashes from
prior incineration, was thought to be the most frightful calamity by the
greater number of the people.

It might appear that people of such scientific erudition would not be so
seemingly childish in religious conceptions as this. As a verity it was
not childishness. Instead, it was an insistence upon such entire
destruction of the earthly casket of the soul, as to render certain the
freedom of the real person from all earthly restraint in entering into,
Navazzamin.

Not that many people understood the esoteric significance of the rite;
no, they but understood so much of the real meaning as the Incali had
given them through comparing the earth-leaving soul to the seed which,
sprouting, leaves behind it every fragment of the shell.

To return to the Incalithlon and the ceremonial of my adoption by Prince
Menax.

As we stood beside the Maxin-Stone, Gwauxln bade me kneel, and then,
placing his hand upon my head, spoke, saying:

"In harmony with the laws of the land, made and provided in such cases,
Astika Menax, a Councilor of the land of Poseid, hath a wish to adopt
thee, Zailm Numinos, for a son unto his name, in place of one departed
hence into Navazzamin. Wherefore, as thy Sovereign and his, I, Gwauxln,
Rai of Poseid, do declare it to be as prayed for by Astika Menax."

The Incaliz completed the ceremonies by placing his right hand upon my
head and his left upon that of Menax as we knelt before him, and
invoking the blessing of Incal upon us both. As he removed his hands, he
addressed me thus:

"Be thou erect in the sight of Incal, that no man may accuse thee
truthfully. This do, and thy days shall be long. But even as thou shalt
fail, so then shall thy time be shortened. May the peace of Incal be
with thee."

Not one of the three hearers, of the Incaliz understood him to mean that
my days would be short because I would fail in

<span id="page_136">p. 136</span>

rectitude, but only as a warning were the words taken. Yet I knew
afterwards, all too late, what prescience guided Mainin in his words.
Knew in a flood of bitter memory, which recalled how recreant I had been
to the high resolve on Pitach Rhok to be successful, a, a result of
being true to my divine. God-considering selfhood. But, all this came,
as I thought, too late. Too late was it, when I lay in a dungeon
awaiting death, from which no mortal could save me, and dreamed that my
soul sat on a verdureless shore looking across a limitless ocean. and
crying, "Ah! where is the hope of my years!" Bitter and fiery was the
remorseful agony, but my name was still on the Book of Life; still
there, and not erased as I feared. Karma is inexorable and severe, my
brother, my sister; but our Savior hath said: "Follow Me." "He that hath
an ear to hear, let him hear." "Be ye doers of the word, and not hearers
only."

As we turned away, an Incala, who had been present, began playing on the
great organ of the temple; then the silences of the vast auditorium
responded as no human voice could make them do.

"On the winds the bells' deep tones are swelling--"

The echoes rang again and again as the thundering voices of the great
organ pealed forth, thrilling the soul with its mighty harmony. Rays of
many-hued lights, some brilliant, some soft-tinted as those of a
spectroscopic image of the moon, played from point to point in exhausted
air-tubes, and as the colors changed, so did the notes of music, for
every ray of light, whatsoever its source, is a pulsing choral note, if
developed rightly. Thus the stars sing.

The Rai did not go with Menax and myself, when the conclusion of our
business was reached, but remained with the Incaliz Mainin. With him
Gwauxln was more familiar, his friendship more deeply intimate than with
any other human being. And the reason was that both be and Mainin were
Sons of the Solitude and had been youths together in the days ere public
favor had marked the one for Rai, the other for Incaliz, these both
being elective positions, the office of High Priest being the only
ecclesiastical office which could be filled by

<span id="page_137">p. 137</span>

popular vote. And this exception was because it was considered true
justice to allow the people to consult their own desires in this matter
of choosing one whom all believed to be the most eminently good and
perfect example of moral life, to be over them in this highest spiritual
office.

But in the days of their youth neither had seemed to expect the
preferment which the years had in store, and after the long course
required of Xio Incali at the Xioquithlon, both had hidden the world of
men adieu and had gone forth into the solitudes of the vast mountains,
where only the Sons of Incal had abode, of all mankind. These men were
the Theochristic or Occult Adepts of that olden age, the Yog-Vidya of
their time. They were indeed chary of their wisdom, then as now; but to
Gwauxln and Mainin they imparted it without stint. They had no families
then, nor do these students of God, of Nature, deviate now from the same
celibate principles. None who hope to achieve their deep knowledge will
mate. <span id="fr_7"></span>[1](#fn_7.md)

After years had flown, so many that men had almost forgotten them,
Gwauxln and Mainin did what few had ever been known to do--returned to
the haunts of ordinary humanity. My father, Menax, had been but a babe
when Gwauxln went away, and the latter's sister was not then born. Yet
when Gwauxln came back, the silvery threads of age already gleamed in
the hair of the Prince Menax, while as for the Rai that was to be, he
looked a little more mature, but otherwise unchanged from the youthful
semblance of the days of yore. In the interim, his sister had come to
the world, grown to womanhood, wedded Menax, and after bringing into
life their son, Soris, and their daughter, Anzimee, had gone into the
undiscovered country through the Maxin gateway. Mainin, too, was of a
similarly youthful appearance.

Both of these "Sons of the Solitude" came back, giving as their reason
for return that their presence was needed, and both were eventually
chosen by the people to fill the respective positions which we have seen
them occupying, positions rendered vacant by the death of the
incumbents. It is only now,

<span id="page_138">p. 138</span>

after twelve thousand years have slipped into eternity through the back
door of time that I have come to know how much Mainin had to do with
those events, and how wholly in the dark concerning his real character
was Gwauxln and every other Son of the Solitude. Not to anticipate, is
it strange that Rai-Gwauxln felt more pleasurable intimacy possible in
his intercourse with Mainin than with any other person connected with
his daily life? Or that he felt his finally exposed treachery more
keenly than any one else could? I think not.
