# CHAPTER III

### FAITH IS KNOWLEDGE ALSO, AND IT GIVETH TO REMOVING MOUNTAINS

There is a saying, whose origin is dim through lapse of time, to the
effect that "Knowledge is power." Within well-defined limits this is a
verity. If behind the knowledge lies the requisite energy to realize its
benefits, then only is it a true saying.

<span id="page_58">p. 58</span>

In order to exercise command over nature and her forces, the would-be
operator must have perfect comprehension of the natural laws involved.
It is the degree of attainment in this knowledge which marks the less or
greater ability of the performer, and those who have acquired the
profoundest understanding of the Law (Lex Magnum) are masters whose
powers seem so marvelous as to be magical. Uninitiated minds are
absolutely alarmed by their incomprehensible manifestations. On every
side of me when I came from my mountain home to my metropolitan abode I
found inexplicable wonders, but natural dignity saved me from appearing
ignorant. Little by little was I to acquire familiarity with my
environment, and thereby gain a knowledge of the things which have been
referred to since I first mentioned the exchange of country life for
urban surroundings. But these attainments of pleasing authority over
nature demanded a special course. That course of study had not yet been
determined upon by me, prior to my introduction to the city, for it
seemed that the part of wisdom was to concentrate my energies upon
specialties and not to scatter force by attempting generalities. To this
end I determined to live for a more or less extended period without
seeking admission to the Xioquithlon, and resolved to devote the interim
to observation. I had been an extensive reader of books, which I
obtained from the public library in the district where my mountain home
had been. From these I had gained no inconsiderable understanding of
social polity. The fact that there were but ninety-one elective offices
in the gift of the people, while there were almost three hundred
millions of Poseidi in Atl and her colonies, and according to a late
census which I had seen, thirty-seven, nearly thirty-eight, millions of
electors held First Degree diplomas, thus entitling them to hold
elective offices, disposed me to think it extremely improbable that such
a high preferment would ever fall to my lot. But if I could scarcely
expect a ministerial office, I yet felt that I might, if I fitted myself
therefor by gaining a prime diploma, attain to a high political level
and hold an

<span id="page_59">p. 59</span>

appointive position, and some of these were almost equally as honorable
as a councilorship. What special subjects should I concentrate Upon?
Geological research was very attractive to me, and by its numerous
branches offered wide and alluring fields of opportunity. Then again,
philology was almost as much so; my ability to acquire foreign languages
was not inconsiderable, as I had found from studying a little volume
descriptive of a land known as Suernis, a strange country, and of the
language of which many examples were given; these I had without effort
learned perfectly from once reading.

Several months of city residence at length found me determined to
acquire all the geological knowledge that I could, for it was a study
which I believed Incal had directed me to make, as also a knowledge of
mines and of practical mineralogy. As co-efficients I purposed
thoroughly to ground myself in synthetic and analytical literature, not
alone of my native Poseid, but also that of the Suerni and Necropanic
languages. Thus have I named the three greatest nations of pre-Noachian
(pre-Nepthian) times. One of these nations was effaced from the earth,
but the other two have, after terrible vicissitudes, survived till
today; of them I will speak later.

The reasons which induced me to choose the curriculum which I have
mentioned were, that as a geologist and coordinate scientist I hoped to
make new discoveries of value, and to place them in book form before the
world, at least before the Poseid peoples, who esteemed themselves most
of the world, and end scarcely to be attained otherwise than by this
course of study. The influence which I hoped to gain through such
publications might lead to my becoming Superintendent-General of Mines,
a political place not second to any other appointive office. There
certainly would be other studies required of me if I entered the race
for a prime diploma, but the ones cited were the most agreeable and
would constitute my chief aspiration. As an aside, I may remark that
those studies then selected, and afterwards mastered, led my nature to
assume a bent which resulted, not many yews ago, in my becoming

<span id="page_60">p. 60</span>

a mine-owner in the State of California-and a successful one, too. It so
much more firmly fixed my linguistic leanings that, while a citizen of
the United States of America, I was a master not alone of my native
tongue, but also of thirteen other modern languages, such as French,
German and Spanish, Chinese, several dialectal varieties of Hindustanie,
and Sanskrit as a sort, of mental relaxation. Please not to regard this
confession as due to boastfulness; it is not. I but make it in order to
show thee, my friend, that thine own powers are not matters of heritage
only, but recollected acquirements from some one, or it may be of all of
thy past lives; also to give thee a hint of profit, to wit: that studies
to-day undertaken, no matter how near to the evening of thy days, will
surely bear fruit, not alone in thy present earth life, but in the
experiences of subsequent incarnations also. We see with all we have
seen, we do with all we have done, and we think with all we have
thought. **Verbum sat sapienti**.

In the next chapter I purpose devoting some pages to a consideration of
physical science, as understood by the Poseidi; more especially will I
refer to the prime principles upon which it was based, inasmuch as
neglect, to do this would necessitate the taking of many statements **ex
cathedra** which otherwise might be clearly understood at the moment.
