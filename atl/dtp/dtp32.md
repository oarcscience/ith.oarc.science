### IV

Night. Otherwise the same scene. Our miner sits in his tent door,
meditating on the novel beauty of the scene before, below him. A north
breeze has rolled the smoky sea silently away and left no sign. Beneath
the tent outspreads a vast abyss, dark, silent, "the night's Plutonian
shore." Our miner's fancy fills it with golden phantoms. Only the stars,
"night's tall tapers," lighten the gloom. But far away east, over ranges
of lesser mountains, dim shapes couched in the darkness, far away, miles
real as well as seeming, familiar shadowy shape of vast, uncertain size
appears to shut from sight vision of some awful conflagration. Look! It
grows, it brightens, till on the charmed eyes bursts a sudden, intense
spark, then a full flame in Ieka's side--'tis the moon at its roundest!
And now Ieka's snows glow in its ray like molten silver, the dark abyss
before, beneath the tent lightens, the phantoms flee, while over all,
sublime, glorious, supreme, rises Shasta's argent image.
