# CHAPTER XXII

### ZAILM PROPOSES

My mind was filled with the question which I made paramount, how to
phrase my proposal of marriage to Anzimee. Such occupation of thought is
common to all lovers, of every race and nation, where matchmaking is not
conducted by the parents.

Having set my time for the momentous inquiry, I sought Anzimee. The
information that she was absent at Roxoi palace one of the three set
apart for the Rai, but seldom used by him, was rather perturbing. Lolix
resided at Roxoi, and had done so ever since the time when I secured her
transference from Menaxithlon. But I was not altered in my purpose of
seeing Anzimee; so, while journeying across the city, forty miles to
Roxoi, I pondered the new situation. I knew that the two girls were
friends, and this fact seemed likely to complicate matters. Arrived at
Roxoi, I found Anzimee in the gardens, seated near a cascade that
tumbled over a fairy-like cliff into a mammoth dewdrop of a lake. She
was alone. As I came near she inquired, in a surprised tone:

"Where is Lolix?"

"Where?" I repeated. "I know not. I was told that she was with thee."

"And 'twas truth. But she took my vailx and went away, saying that she
would go and get thee, that we three might have a little outing
together."

I thought rapidly. To Menaxithlon was forty miles across the city due
south. The vailx must therefore take nearly or

<span id="page_192">p. 192</span>

quite as many minutes going in that direction, and the same returning.
Eighty minutes. That would be long enough.

Seating myself beside Anzimee, I took her hand in mine. I had often done
the same before, and even clasped her about with my arm, but in a
distinctly brotherly way. Now the simple touch of the fingers was
electric in effect, and she could at once detect the intensity of
excitement which possessed me. The fine language I had intended to use
was lost, and instead of trying to regain it I said merely:

"Anzimee, would words deepen thy certainty of my love for thee? I can
not command them; but I ask thee, little girl, to be my wife!"

And for reply she answered in phrase as brief:

"Zailm, be it so!"

What followed the reader may imagine; thine own fancy will please thee
best, for surely the picture is not hard to draw.

When Lolix returned, I had departed, nor this hastily, for she had been
delayed in coming back, so that three hours had elapsed since her
departure.

I knew that few things were more certain than that Anzimee would confide
her joy to Lolix. But I had no misgivings, for I felt every confidence
that Lolix would not betray our secret, however terrible the blow might
be for her to bear. As I anticipated, Anzimee told the story of my
avowal, and of her acceptance of me. When the whole was related, Anzimee
said that her friend looked at her a moment, then fell fainting to the
floor. When she had been revived, she seemed so calm that even Anzimee
did not question her statement that the swoon was due to nervousness.
This was at the eventide. Anzimee, filled with happy feelings, saw her
friend in bed, dismissed the attendants, soothed her to sleep, and came
home. These facts I did not learn until next day. I thought it best to
have an interview with Lolix at once, and so experience all the pain and
have done with the anguish of it. Deluded mortal!

I went to Roxoi, and going into the Xanatithlon, awaited Lolix, to whom
I had sent word that I desired to see her there. She came. Fully ten
years seemed to have passed over her

<span id="page_193">p. 193</span>

since I saw her last. Worn. and pale, with great dark rings under her
glorious blue eyes, into which the tears flooded as she caught my quick
gaze. Poor girl! But what could I do? that was my thought. I was even a
little conscience smitten but very little, for the scales of sin were
thick and very numbing to the soul.

She spoke first:

"Oh, my love, my love! Why hast thou done this? Thinkest thou I shall
live? I have for long known that no law existed to bar our union, and
have waited for thee to do what was right, confident that the day would
soon come when thou wouldst ask me to share thy proud name. But--O
Incal! my God! my God! " she exclaimed, bursting into a flood of tears,
that were as quickly repressed. Then in a calmer voice, full of piteous
heartache, she went on:

"Zailm, I love thee too well, even now, to chide thee! I am thine to do
with as thou wilt. I gave thee my life long ago. I gave thee my babe,
and thou didst place it in a home where no man might suspect its
parentage. Zailm, I have done more also--there was another that--that--O
Incal, forgive me! I sent it in to Navazzamin, that it might not accuse
thee, Zailm! And now, I, whom thou hast called thy 'blue-eyed darling,'
I, who love thee more than I do life, am by thee put aside! O God! Why
am I made to suffer thus? Why thus stricken?"

She broke into a storm of agonized weeping, and I sought not to stay the
flood, knowing that sometimes tears are a blessed relief. Had she loved
me thus? Fool! not to have known it from her actions, which spoke louder
than words possibly could. My heart smote me now indeed, and I prayed,
prayed to God for forgiveness, and I prayed to her. Too late! Conscience
came forth at last, born to smite, sprung like Minerva, full-armed for
the combat.

When Lolix had recovered calmness, she said, in such heartbroken tones
as had never fallen on my ears before:

"Zailm, I forgive thee. Not even now will I betray thee, since whom I
once love I will love till death; afterwards, also, if love survive the
grave. If thou art come to say the parting

<span id="page_194">p. 194</span>

word, so be it! But leave me now, for I am almost crazed! Yet remember,
my darling, that if thy new life be not happy, though I pray Incal it
may be, that there once beat a heart for thee warmer, more loving,
perchance truer, than I fancy thou'lt find that of thy new love. I shall
not live long to be a shadow over thy peace. Kiss me once as thou
wouldst if I were thine own wife in the sight of the world, as I am in
that of Incal, and having died, thou wert about to confide my clay to
the Unfed Light."

With these words she stopped, arisen and come before where I sat, and
placed her arms around me, drawing me into a embrace. A moment thus,
then her lips, chill as those of one who keepeth company with Death, met
mine in one long, sobbing kiss! She released her clasp, stood an
instant, and was gone. So she left me. Long I sat in the midst of the
flowers in the great conservatory at Roxoi.

"The blossoms blushed bright--but a worm was below,  
The moonlight shone fair--there was blight in the beam;  
Sweet whispered the breeze but it whispered of woe,  
And bitterness flowed in the soft-flowing strewn."

KARMA DISPOSES

That night the banns of my coming marriage with Anzimee would be
announced by the Incaliz Mainin in the great temple, for in cases of
high social rank it was customary thus to add extra formality to the
publication. If, during the ceremony, a death was to occur within the
Incalithlon, custom decreed that one entire year must elapse before
consummation of the marriage rites. In any event one month must pass
after the banns, which were in consequence declared immediately
following the engagement. For reasons of his own, Mainin the Incaliz
desired that Anzimee should not wed any one; but as he had no authority
over and but little acquaintance with her he kept silent respecting his
wishes.

At the proper hour, Anzimee and myself stood before Mainin the Incaliz,
within the Holy Seat. By our side was Rai Gwauxln and Menax, the five of
us being the cynosure of the eyes of a great audience.

<span id="page_195">p. 195</span>

In a clear, slow voice, the Incaliz began an invocation to Incal. But in
the midst of this service, a woman glided quickly across the triangle of
the Place of Life, in the center of which was the Maxin. It was Lolix.
She was as faultlessly attired as it was her pride always to be. Apart
from the awful blaze in her eyes I saw nothing extraordinary in her
appearance. But to have stepped into the Place of Life was an
impermissible thing, and the act centered all eyes upon her. It meant an
appeal to the authority of the Rai.

"What wouldst thou?" asked Gwauxln. "Zo Rai, in Salda, my native land,
it was the custom to allow either sex to woo the other in marriage. I
wooed this man, the Astika Zailm, ignorant that he loved my friend--how
could I know? And now, I pray thee, deny the banns, is thou hast a right
to do."

"Woman, I am sorry for thee! But the customs of Salda are not those of
Poseid. I grant not thy prayer,"

I had felt a numbing terror lest at fast my crime was to be revealed.
But the fear faded as the slender, graceful figure of Lolix turned and
was swallowed up in the audience. Then the interrupted banns were
renewed. When Mainin said to Anzimee:

"Thou dost declare it thy wish to wed this man?" she replied:

"I do."

"And thou, dost thou declare it to be thy wish to wed this woman?" To
which I said: "Even so, Incal not preventing." As I made answer the
proceedings were the second time interrupted by Lolix, who again came
into the Place of Life, but this time as hurriedly as if pursued.
Opposite the Unfed Light she stopped, and said:

"Incal will prevent! See, I come to wed thee now, Zailm, and here! The
God of departed souls shall be our Incaliz, this dagger our wedding
proclamation, banns and all!

I ought to have prefaced the narration of the questions put to Anzimee
and myself by explaining that after the invocation by Mainin, that
person, Anzimee and myself, and the Rai with

<span id="page_196">p. 196</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Menax, had left
the Holy Seat and had gone into the Place of Life, so that Lolix now
stood close beside me. As she spoke of the dagger her words were calm,
but rapidly uttered--it was the calmness of insanity! Crazed by the
course I had followed, Lolix stood there, her glorious blue eyes filled
with the light of madness. With her last words still upon her lips, she
struck at my breast with the keen weapon. I warded the blow with my arm,
which was pierced through by the forceful stroke. As she drew it out
with a wrench, blood spurted over the granite floor. At sight of this
she uttered a frightful shriek, saying:

"Mad! Mad! MAD!!!" and with one bound sprang to the center of the Place
of Life, where she stood by the cube of the Maxin.

Anzimee swooned; Menax stood as if petrified, gazing at my flowing
blood, while Gwauxln, pale but calm, spoke to a guardsman near:

"Arrest the maniac!"

The order of the Rai attracted the attention of Lolix, who said to the
approaching soldier:

"No, no, arrest not me. I was mad, but I am not. Whosoever shall touch
me, him will I curse, and then die in the Maxin."

Being superstitious, the guardsman paused, for he dared not touch her,
neither disobey the Rai. In his terror he turned to the latter and began
to make excuse.

"Silence!" thundered Gwauxln. Then in gentle tones he said to Lolix:
"Woman, come to me."

"Not so, Zo Rai! At this place beside the Maxin no one under the law may
offer me violence. Here, then, I stay!"

Speaking thus, Lolix rearranged her slightly disordered turban, folded
her arms, and then leaning back against the Maxin-cube, gazed calmly at
the Rai. He made no motion, but looked first at her, then at me. Lolix,
though still near to the Maxin, had assumed an erect position, no longer
touching the cube.

Incaliz Mainin had stood quietly by during the excitement. He now said:

<span id="page_197">p. 197</span>

"Aye, Astiku from Salda, there thou shalt stay, indeed, even longer than
thou thinkest!"

He had spoken very [calmly](errata.htm#12.md), even softly, gazing the
while at the unhappy girl. When he turned towards the Rai, he saw a look
of horror on his face, and hurriedly looked away again, finishing the
reading of the banns. I scarcely heard him, being engaged partly with my
bleeding arm, and partly with Anzimee, who, but partially recovered, and
still half fainting, leaned against me for support. When the ceremony
was completed, Rai Gwauxln, placing a hand on each of our heads, said:
"Not only a year must elapse ere ye may wed, but much longer! Zailm, I
do forgive thee thy sins so far as it is mine to forgive, the human laws
thou hast broken. As for thy partner in wrong, never mind."

Then turning to Mainin, the Incaliz, he sternly said:

"Because of thine accursed deed, thou and I are forevermore strangers!
Now I know thee for what, alas. thou art."

Having spoken in this, to his hearers, enigmatical and startling
language, Gwauxln left the Incalithlon. Mainin also left. Menax, become
curious regarding the unhappy cause of all this trouble, spoke to her as
she stood by the Unfed Light. She neither answered nor moved. I
approached near to her and said gently:

"Lolix?"

Still no answer nor movement. I touched her silken bodice, but received
a shock which startled me like an unexpected blow! Her corsage was as
rigid as stone. I touched her hand; it, too, was cold and stiff. Her
face, even her wavy brown tresses, were alike rigid. Not only was she
dead, but actual rock! Like one in a dream, too much stunned to be
horrified, but still possessed of a strange curiosity, I rapped with my
knuckles on the various thin edges presented by folds in her robe, and
heard them sound with a metallic clink. I grasped a finger; it broke
off, and then in a sudden wave of awful living horror I dropped it upon
the stone floor; it broke into fragments like any fragile bit of rock.
Still were the golden tresses, with which I had so often caressingly
played,

<span id="page_198">p. 198</span>

of the old lovely color. Her complexion, her blue eyes, even, were of
the same natural hue they had been in life, but for all that her body
was stone and her soul was forever fled! Her pretty foot, showing from
beneath the hem of tier robe, was not only as the rest, stone, but it
was petrified fast to the stone pavement on which she stood. At last I
realized all. This hideous deed was the work of 'Mainin in that instant
he looked at Lolix in speaking to her. He had prostituted his occult
wisdom, and for this had Gwauxln cursed him. Lolix's flesh and blood and
raiment had been transmuted into solid stone. This petrification was all
that remained of poor, wronged, forsaken Lolix, a perfect statue which,
if suffered by man to remain, might stand during the many centuries,
till even stone at last crumbled to dust.

The awful meaning of it all came home to me at last. Was I primarily
responsible for it? In that moment I knew that I was, knew that the
murder was on my soul, as well as on that of Mainin, who had never found
that opportunity, at least except by me.

Even in her temporary insanity Lolix had been true to me. Not one word
had she spoken to involve me. If Gwauxln knew, and I was aware that he
did, he gave me free pardon so far as human law was concerned. For the
broken laws of Incal he could not extend pardon, that was become karma,
and lay a weary width of desert sands of sin to scorch my feet in the
passage I must make across them ere ever I could tread the narrow way of
attainment. The long atonement was before me. I gazed on the mute form
of the girl I had so fondly loved, and loved yet, until Menax, who had
become aware of the awful occurrence while I stood stupefied, but on
whom the main effect was a desire to leave as soon as possible, pulled
me by the sleeve:

"Come, Zailm; let us go home."

Giving one last remorseful look, I obeyed. Lovely Lolix. Her voice was
still in death, and that through me! As remorse surged over my soul, I
thought that I would now be glad to ask Anzimee to release me, confess
all to her, and with

<span id="page_199">p. 199</span>

her consent make Lolix my honored wife; but it wag forever too late in
that life thus to make reparation. No more could the tender glance of
love flash on me from those starry eyes of blue! No more would my weary
head nestle down on tier shoulder, while with gentle caress she chased
away my darker musings with a mild and gentle sympathy. Ah, ye gods!
what had I lost? My life, that had seemed complete, and as a sphere like
unto the full moon, was come, like that orb when it rises late at night,
to seem torn and but half of itself, wrecked and ragged, careening
through the night-time of existence.

Anzimee knew nothing of the awful reality; she had been too much stunned
by the sudden knowledge of her friend's insanity. She must not know, if
it were possible to prevent her learning of it. We went to our carriage
and, solemn the one, stunned the other, and wildly remorseful the third,
got in and went home to Menaxithlon. Home? I felt that the peace of hone
was no more mine! Life had become a desert over which stalked the
skeletons of despair, regret and sorrow; overhead a moonless sky,
underfoot in the night a howling waste of sand, blown hither and thither
by curbless winds. Lolix was gone, Anzimee would never be mine, as I
felt in prophetic forecast of soul, and so, with bowed head, I sat in
the midst of the desert of my days and let the phantoms dance about and
mock me, unheeded.
