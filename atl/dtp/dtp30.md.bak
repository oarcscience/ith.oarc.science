### II

On the old wagon road which existed ere ever iron rails linked Oregon's
greatest city to the metropolis of the Golden West, there still stands,
as for thirty years, not many miles from the State line, a station
established for stage line uses, and "run" by "Daddy Dollarhyde." A
lonely place, hidden amongst towering pines, which make regal raiment
for the great "Siskiyou Ridge" of the Coast Range extending in gloomy
grandeur not miles, but hundreds of miles, Dollarhyde's appeals to the
heart of the traveler' as Saharan oasis, to the weary caravan. "'Tis a
lodge in some vast wilderness," and in the days of this second "Shasta
Scene" (A. D. 1884) was the only footprint of civilization for many a
long mile.

Leaving Dollarhyde's, the road wound as directly as possible up a
two-mile stretch of exceedingly steep mountain. Up this steep, long
before aught but hinted dawn lit those grand ridges, a youth, on foot
and alone, was climbing. A tramp? Temporarily; down below, at
Dollarhyde's, the rest of his party yet slept. Up, up he toiled,
stopping when the love of nature prompted him to "bold communion with
her visible forms," and listen to her "various language"; pausing, the
better to enjoy the exhilarating freedom, the beauty of the piny slopes,
the whirr of the early grouse, and the chattering of squirrel and
chipmunk. Once, enchanted by the exquisite charm of a crystal spring
that leapt into and across the road, he stayed his step; and again, he
stood gazing afar down into the gloom of

a great canyon, which became lost to view "in the dawn's early light."
The summit at last! But still no sun in the sky. All beneath was yet
quietly resting 'neath the sway of Morpheus. Ah! what is that? Away in
the south is a huge, dim mass, dull gray below, but, where its peak
holds aloft the sky, 'tis rosy, glowing pink. As the youth gazes,
spellbound, Old Sol dispels the valley glooms, thrusts aside the night,
and the new day is born. The rose tints are gone, but also the gray, and
in their place appears a giant, pointed cone of purest white, albeit
streaked at its base with black lines, each some awful gorge. It rises
not like other mountain piles, from ranges rivalling its own height; no,
all alone it stands forth from its high plateau, piercing heaven's blue,
from base to summit, eleven thousand feet, from ocean's plane to apical
peak thirty-five hundred more--Shasta, O, Mt. Shasta.
