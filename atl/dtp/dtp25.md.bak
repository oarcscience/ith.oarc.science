# CHAPTER XXI

### THE MISTAKE OF A LIFE

Comparison is good mental exercise. It is due to the reader and to
myself, as well as to Anzimee and Lolix, to indulge a

<span id="page_187">p. 187</span>

present mood prompting me to make an analytical comparison of these two
women.

What was it that fixed so unalterably my desire to wed Anzimee and not
Lolix? Both were gentlewomen, the first by nature, the second by--yes,
by nature also. I was, however, about to ascribe the sweet charity of
Lolix to the perception on her part of the misery she would feel, placed
in like situation with those who suffered in very fact. But the ability
to so perceive could arise only from its existence in her nature. No, it
was her nature finally developed. Both women were refined, intelligent,
and both were beautiful, though of types m widely variant as a blush
rose and a white lily. Anzimee was a born daughter of Atl; Lolix was one
by adoption. A small difference, surely, since both were in full accord
and equally sensitive to, the good, the beautiful and the true, in the
polished refinement of erudite Poseid. Truly, the relations between
Lolix and myself were wrong, but she was not on that account less dear
to me, nor was my regard for her less tender and loving. Her
companionship had become a part of my life. If I had a sorrow or was
despondent, she interposed her sympathy and cheered me. My anxieties
were also hers; my joys her joys. In everything but name she was my
wife. Then why did not I acknowledge the fact before mankind? Because
karma ordered otherwise. I loved Anzimee also. Through this love, karma
operated to annul its own tendencies to espouse Lolix. And the mode of
this operation was exhibited in my recognition of Lolix as possessed of
every requisite to make me happy except in her one lack, that of
[psychic](errata.htm#11.md) perception of the relation of the finite to the
infinite. Absurd? No. That my soul craved such an ability on her part,
and found it not, but did find it in Anzimee, was evidence of the growth
of the frail seedling of interest in. the occult life of the Sons of the
Solitude, which had been somewhat matured by the words of Rai Ernon of
Suern, years before. Sayest thou that if a little such interest worked
such error in life that deep interest would make for the losing of the
soul, wherefore thou wilt have none of it? Not so. It was the not being
true to the

<span id="page_188">p. 188</span>

ideal at that time gained, true with all my soul, that did the mischief,
just as in the myth of Lot's wife, she had never been turned to salt had
she obeyed, not curiosity, but the higher injunction.

Lolix had no dimmest perception of this psychic link between the things
of earth and the things of infinity. I had; I knew Anzimee had;
wherefore I ordered my life so as to include her and exclude Lolix,
whereby I did both them, myself and my conception of God (which is but a
redundant expression, for no one finite can injure Infinity) a fearful
injustice. But karma lay in wait for the evil of my life, demanded
payment--and got it, every jot; no words can paint the suffering of the
expiation. I scarcely propose to try and shall rest content if a
realization of some part of it shall deter others from sin through the
certitude that there is no vicarious expiation for evil done, and no
escape from its penalty.

The Law of the ONE reads: "Except a man overcometh, he shall not inherit
of My life; I will not be his God, neither shall he be My son." There
can be but one way to such overcoming, the ever-recurrent plungings into
material incarnation, until the errors of the personal will are at-oned
to the Divine Will. There can be no vicarious undoing, <span
id="fr_10"></span>[1](#fn_10.md) and soon will I show why. Another can not
do thy breathing for thee. Reincarnation, the ever-recurrent prisoning
of the soul in fleshly bodies, is but expiatory, is but penalty. If in
His Name ye are become free, if in that Way ye have overcome, and in
place of being slaves to are masters over desire, ye have undone sin.
Then is there no more incarnation for you in the prison of this death,
miscalled life. There is no other Way; the Great Master pointed none.

In expiation of my dark past I must needs return into the world, thy
world of sin, sorrow, sickness and pain, and disappointed longings for
the peace that passeth understanding. Is not my twelve thousand and more
years of further wanderings in the far land of this world, far from my
Father's house, and feeding on the husks called joy, suffering the
fevers, pains and

.

<span id="page_189">p. 189</span>

disappointment of hopes, enough of expiation? Yet for a little while
longer I must and, impelled by love, willingly do serve Him. Some souls
shall have even more than I, if they turn not. Which *will* ye? Will is
the sole Way to esoteric, or occult Christian knowledge. Whosoever will,
shall have Eternal Life. But the *will* to overcome must replace our
will of desire, as the fresh air replaces the exhalations of our lung.
As the atmosphere is around about us, and, inhaled, becomes our breath,
so the Will of the Spirit is around us and, entering into the heart that
hath determined to strangle into submission the serpent, suffers us not
to know defeat. But I, and Lolix, refused this Breath, and unwilling,
turned away. Oh! the horror, the pain, of those lost ages, lost with
her! But refound by us both, in--*overcoming*. I am sorry to admit that
such moral obliquity could ever have warped my character, even twelve
thousand years ago! *Will is the only Way to Christ*.

Is it not an appalling contemplation, to think that, having determined
to put Lolix away and to install Anzimee in her place by honorably
wedding her before mankind, I was able to calculate upon my knowledge of
Lolix and to depend upon her acquiescence in keeping my secret because
of her unselfish love for me? Monstrous! I knew that Lolix did nothing
by halves. Having given herself to me, she would not expose my iniquity,
even though I rejected her for another; society had no reproach for a
woman betrayed.

In pursuance of my plan, I proposed to obtain the spoken affirmation of
the love that had long been confessed by the demeanor of Anzimee. Then I
would tell Lolix all, reserving nothing, and throw myself on her mercy.
Even after these many, many centuries, when--Laus Deo!--reparation is at
last complete, I look at the record of this part of my life when I was
Zailm, and wonder that the very confession does not scorch holes in the
paper upon which it is written. Moral turpitude is a fearful thing, for,
though conscious of its being sinful, I was but dimly aware of the
hideous blackness of my action.

<span id="page_190">p. 190</span>

Canst thou dissociate, reader, thy horror at the one action sufficiently
to take interest in the recital of my profession of love made to
Anzimee, after I had hidden from my own sight the evil of my life? It
may be almost futile to try; yet it is possible to forget anything out
of sight, at least to such a degree.

"That one may smile, and smile, and be a villain."

More especially is it easy to smile when the evil is in such a fax, far
past tense, is atoned, and the villain is one no longer. Thou wilt
pardon me if I hint the Way of at-onement. Of all my thousands of years
of my many lives, to which in this history I can but briefly allude, I
draw for thee one lesson that the weary pilgrimage hath taught me, and
in my soul I pray thee heed it. For I am longing for my release, when I
may go out into the blessed realms that mine eyes have seen, mine ears
heard, and myself been amidst, with Him who openeth and no man shutteth,
and shutteth and no man openeth. So this know, and these things; so long
as any that read my words turn aside, and will not to know and do His
Way, so long do ye keep me out of my part in the Great Peace, until His
spirit shall cease to strive with thee, or hinder thee. I am working and
sacrificing that ye may know that Way; and tread it. Yet some of you
will, even at the finality, be of them that, denying Him, are by Him
denied. Out of all the glorious systems of worlds, only Earth denieth,
for acknowledging Him by words and crying, "Lord, Lord," they yet hate
one another in their serpent-dominated hearts. Think not that I use any
figure of speech when I say "serpent"; microscopists know better. "He
that soweth to the flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that
soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit have Life everlasting." They
that are *alive* have crucified the flesh with its affections. Some will
close the eye and the ear to my message I have of Him. By that shall the
seed of Eternal Life be closed out of their souls, and they shall
die. <span id="fr_11"></span>[1](#fn_11.md) But so

<span id="page_191">p. 191</span>

many as in all things turn unto the Way shall in no wise be cast out. He
said it who is true. Keep thy lamps trimmed and be wise, not foolish
virgins.
