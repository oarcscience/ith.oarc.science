### The Arts.

To trace the development of the Arts among the Lemurians, we must start
with the history of the fifth sub-race. The separation of the sexes was
now fully accomplished, and man inhabited a completely physical body,
though it was still of gigantic stature. The offensive and defensive war
with the monstrous beasts of prey had already begun, and men had taken
to living in huts. To build their huts they tore down trees, and piled
them up in a rude fashion. At first each separate family lived in its
own clearing in the jungle, but they soon found it safer, as a defence
against the wild beasts, to draw together and live in small communities.
Their huts, too, which had been formed of rude trunks of trees, they now
learnt to build with boulders of stone, while the weapons with which
they attacked, or defended themselves against the Dinosauria and other
wild beasts, were spears of sharpened wood, similar to the staff held by
the man whose appearance is described above.

Up to this time agriculture was unknown, and the uses of fire had not
been discovered. The food of their boneless ancestors who crawled on the
earth were such things as they could find on the surface of the ground
or just below it. Now that they walked erect many of the wild forest
trees provided them with nuts and berries, but their chief article of
food was the flesh of the beasts and reptiles which they slew, tore in
pieces, and devoured.
