### Probable Duration of the Continent of Lemuria.

A period--speaking roughly--of between four and five million years
probably represents the life of the continent of Atlantis, for it is
about that time since the Rmoahals, the first sub-race of the Fourth
Root Race who inhabited Atlantis, arose on a portion of the Lemurian
Continent which at that time still existed. Remembering that in the
evolutionary process the figure four invariably represents not only the
nadir of the cycle, but the period of shortest duration, whether in the
case of a Manvantara

or of a race, it may be assumed that the number of millions of years
assignable as the life-limit of the continent of Lemuria must be very
much greater than that representing the life of Atlantis, the continent
of the Fourth Root Race. But in the case of Lemuria no dates can be
stated with even approximate accuracy. Geological epochs, so far as they
are known to modern science, will be a better medium for contemporary
reference, and they alone will be dealt with.
