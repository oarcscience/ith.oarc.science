### Sin of the Mindless.

The shameful acts of the mindless men at the first separation of the
sexes had best be referred to in the words of the stanzas of the archaic
Book of Dzyan. No commentary is needed.

"During the Third Race the boneless animals grew and changed, they
became animals with bones, their chayas became solid.

"The animals separated first. They began to breed. The two-fold man
separated also. He said, 'Let us as they; let us unite and make
creatures.' They did.

"And those that had no spark took huge she-animals unto them. They begat
upon them dumb races. Dumb they were themselves. But their tongues
untied. The tongues of their progeny remained still. Monsters they bred.
A race of crooked red-hair-covered monsters going on all fours. A dumb
race to keep the shame untold." (And an ancient commentary adds 'when
the Third separated and fell into sin by breeding men-animals, these
(the animals) became ferocious, and men and they mutually destructive.
Till then, there was no sin, no life taken.').

"Seeing which the Lhas who had not built men, wept, saying. 'The Amanasa
\[mindless\] have defiled our future abodes. This is Karma. Let us dwell
in the others. Let us teach them better lest worse should happen.' They
did.

"Then all men became endowed with Manas. They saw the sin of the
mindless."
