### Lemurian Races still Inhabiting the Earth.

It may be as well again to repeat that the almost mindless creatures who
inhabited such bodies as have been above described during the early
sub-races of the Lemurian period can scarcely be regarded as completely
human. It was only after the separation of the sexes, when their bodies
had become densely physical, that they became human even in appearance.
It must be remembered that the beings we are speaking of, though
embracing the second and third groups of the Lunar Pitris, must also
have been largely recruited from the animal kingdom of that (the Lunar)
Manvantara. The degraded remnants of the Third Root Race who still
inhabit the earth may be recognised in the aborigines of Australia, the
Andaman Islanders, some hill tribes of India, the Tierra-del-Fuegans,
the Bushmen of Africa, and some other savage tribes. The entities now
inhabiting these bodies must have belonged to the animal kingdom in the
early part of this Manvantara. It was probably during the evolution of
the Lemurian race and

before the "door was shut" on the entities thronging up from below, that
these attained the human kingdom.
