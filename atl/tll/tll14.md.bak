### Origin of the Pithecoid and the Anthropoid Apes.

The anatomical resemblance between Man and the higher Ape, so frequently
cited by Darwinists as pointing to some ancestor common to both,
presents an interesting problem, the proper solution of which is to be
sought for in the esoteric explanation of the genesis of the pithecoid
stocks.

Now, we gather from the Secret Doctrine <span
id="fr_17"></span>[1](#fn_17.md) that the descendants of these semi-human
monsters described above as originating in the sin of the "mindless,"
having through long centuries dwindled in size and become more densely
physical, culminated in a race of Apes at the time of the Miocene
period, from which in their turn are descended the pithecoids of to-day.
With these Apes of the Miocene period, however, the Atlanteans of that
age renewed the sin of the "mindless"--this time with full
responsibility, and the resultants of their crime are the species of
Apes now known as Anthropoid.

We are given to understand that in the coming Sixth Root Race, these
anthropoids will obtain human incarnation, in the bodies doubtless of
the lowest races then existing upon earth.

That part of the Lemurian continent where the separation of the sexes
took place, and where both the fourth and the fifth sub-races
flourished, is to be found in the earlier of the two maps. It lay to the
east of the mountainous region of which the present Island of Madagascar
formed a part, and thus occupied a central position around the smaller
of the two great lakes.
