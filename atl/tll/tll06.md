### Reptiles and Pine Forests.

From this statement it will be seen that Lemurian man lived in the age
of Reptiles and Pine Forests. The amphibious monsters and the gigantic
tree-ferns of the Permian age still flourished in the warm damp
climates. Plesiosauri and Icthyosauri swarmed in the tepid marshes of
the Mesolithic epoch, but, with the drying up of many of the inland
seas, the Dinosauria--the monstrous land reptiles--gradually became the
dominant type, while the Pterodactyls--the Saurians which developed
bat-like wings-not only crawled on the earth, but flew through the air.
The smallest of these latter were about the size of a sparrow; the
largest, however, with a breadth of wing of more than sixteen feet,
exceeding the largest of our living birds of to-day; while most of the
Dinosauria-the Dragons-were terrible beasts of prey, colossal reptiles
which attained a length of from forty to fifty feet. <span

skeletons of an even larger size. Professor Ray Lankester, at a meeting
of the Royal Institution On 7th January, 1904, is reported to have
referred to a brontosaurus

skeleton of sixty-five feet long, which had been discovered in the
Oolite deposit in the southern part of the United States of America.

As it is written in the stanzas of the archaic Book of Dzyan, "Animals
with bones, dragons of the deep, and flying sarpas were added to the
creeping things. They that creep on the ground got wings. They of the
long necks in the water became the progenitors of the fowls of the air."
Modem science records her endorsement. "The class of birds as already
remarked is so closely allied to Reptiles in internal structure and by
embryonal development that they undoubtedly originated out of a branch
of this class . . . . . The derivation of birds from reptiles first took
place in the Mesolithic epoch, and this moreover probably during the
Trias." <span id="fr_12"></span>[1](#fn_12.md)

In the vegetable kingdom this epoch also saw the pine and the palm-tree
gradually displace the giant tree ferns. In the later days of the
Mesolithic epoch, mammals for the first time came into existence, but
the fossil remains of the mammoth and mastodon, which were their
earliest representatives, are chiefly found in the subsequent strata of
the Eocene and Miocene times.
