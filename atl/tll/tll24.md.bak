### A Lodge of Initiation.

Naturally it was not for the benefit of the Lemurian race that the Lodge
was founded. Such of them as were sufficiently advanced were, it is
true, taught by the Adept Gurus, but the instruction they required was
limited to the explanation of a few physical phenomena, such as the fact
that the earth moves round the sun, or to the explanation of the
different appearance which physical objects assumed for them when
subjected alternately to their physical sight and their astral vision.

It was, of course, for the sake of those who, while endowed with the
stupendous powers of transferring their consciousness from the planet
Venus to this our earth, and of providing for their use and their work
while here appropriate vehicles in which to function, were yet pursuing
the course of their own evolution. <span id="fr_22"></span>[1](#fn_22.md)
For their sake it was--for the sake of those who, having entered the
Path, had only reached the lower grades, that this Lodge of Initiation
was founded.

Though, as we know, the goal of normal evolution is greater and more
glorious than can, from our present standpoint, be well imagined, it is
by no means synonymous with that expansion of consciousness which,
combined with and alone made possible by, the purification and
ennoblement of character, constitute the heights to which the Pathway of
Initiation leads.

The investigation into what constitutes this purification and
ennoblement of character, and the endeavour to realise what that
expansion of consciousness really means are subjects which have been
written of elsewhere.

Suffice it now to point out that the founding of a Lodge of Initiation
for the sake of Beings who came from another scheme of evolution is an
indication of the unity of object and of aim in the government and the
guidance of *all* the schemes of evolution brought into existence by our
Solar Logos. Apart from the normal course in our own scheme, there is,
we know, a Path by which He may be directly reached, which every son of
man in his progress through the ages is privileged to hear of, and to
tread, if he so chooses. We find that this was so in the Venus scheme
also, and we may presume it is or will be so in all the schemes which
form part of our Solar system. This Path is the Path of Initiation, and
the end to which leads is the same for all, and that end is Union with
God.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_22"></span>[43:1](tll24.htm#fr_22.md) The heights reached by
them will find their parallel when our humanity will, countless aeons
hence, have reached the Sixth Round of our chain of worlds, and the same
transcendent powers will be the possession of ordinary mankind in those
far-off ages.
