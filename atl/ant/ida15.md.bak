### CHAPTER XIII

#### THE HETMAN OF JITOMIR'S STORY

<span class="smallcaps">Count Casimir</span> had reached that stage
where drunkenness takes on a kind of gravity, of regretfulness.

He thought a little, then began his story. I regret that I cannot
reproduce more perfectly its archaic flavor.

"When the grapes begin to color in Antinea's garden, I shall be
sixty-eight. It is very sad, my dear boy, to have sowed all your wild
oats. It isn't true that life is always beginning over again. How
bitter, to have known the Tuileries in 1860, and to have reached the
point where I am now!

"One evening, just before the war (I remember that Victor Black was
still living), some charming women whose names I need not disclose (I
read the names of their sons from time to time in the society news of
the *Gaulois*) expressed to me their desire to rub elbows with some real
*demi-mondaines* of the artist quarter. I took them to a ball at the
*Grande* 

<span id="page_193">p. 193</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> *Chaumière*. There
was a crowd of young painters, models, students. In the midst of the
uproar, several couples danced the cancan till the chandeliers shook
with it. We noticed especially a little, dark man, dressed in a
miserable top-coat and checked trousers which assuredly knew the support
of no suspenders. He was cross-eyed, with a wretched beard and hair as
greasy as could be. He bounded and kicked extravagantly. The ladies
called him Leon Gambetta.

"What an annoyance, when I realize that I need only have felled this
wretched lawyer with one pistol shot to have guaranteed perfect
happiness to myself and to my adopted country, for, my dear fellow, I am
French at heart, if not by birth.

"I was born in 1829, at Warsaw, of a Polish father and a Russian mother.
It is from her that I hold my title of Hetman of Jitomir. It was
restored to me by Czar Alexander II on a request made to him on his
visit to Paris, by my august master, the Emperor Napoleon III.

"For political reasons, which I cannot describe without retelling the
history of unfortunate Poland, my father, Count Bielowsky, left Warsaw
in 1830, and went to live in London. After the death of my mother, he
began to squander his immense fortune—from sorrow, he said. When, in his
time, he died at the period of the Prichard affair, he left me barely a
thousand pounds sterling of income, plus two or

<span id="page_194">p. 194</span>

three systems of gaming, the impracticability of which I learned later.

"I will never be able to think of my nineteenth and twentieth years
without emotion, for I then completely liquidated this small
inheritance. London was indeed an adorable spot in those days. I had a
jolly bachelor's apartment in Piccadilly.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

"'Piccadilly! Shops, palaces, bustle and breeze,  
  The whirling of wheels and the murmur of trees.'

</div>

"Fox hunting in a *briska*, driving a buggy in Hyde Park, the rout, not
to mention the delightful little parties with the light Venuses of Drury
Lane, this took all my time. All? I am unjust. There was also gaming,
and a sentiment of filial piety forced me to verify the systems of the
late Count, my father. It was gaming which was the cause of the event I
must describe to you, by which my life was to be so strangely changed.

"My friend, Lord Malmesbury, had said to me a hundred times, 'I must
take you to see an exquisite creature who lives in Oxford Street, number
277, Miss Howard.' One evening I went with him. It was the twenty-second
of February, 1848. The mistress of the house was really marvelously
beautiful, and the guests were charming. Besides Malmesbury, I observed
several acquaintances: Lord Clebden, Lord Chesterfield, Sir Francis
Mountjoye,

<span id="page_195">p. 195</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Major in the
Second Life Guards, and Count d’Orsay. They played cards and then began
to talk politics. Events in France played the main part in the
conversation and they discussed endlessly the consequences of the revolt
that had broken out in Paris that same morning, in consequence of the
interdiction of the banquet in the 12th arrondissement, of which word
had just been received by telegram. Up to that time, I had never
bothered myself with public affairs. So I don't know what moved me to
affirm with the impetuosity of my nineteen years that the news from
France meant the Republic next day and the Empire the day after. . . .

"The company received my sally with a discreet laugh, and their looks
were centered on a guest who made the fifth at a *bouillotte* table
where they had just stopped playing.

"The guest smiled, too. He rose and came towards me. I observed that he
was of middle height, perhaps even shorter, buttoned tightly into a blue
frock coat, and that his eye had a far-off, dreamy look.

"All the players watched this scene with delighted amusement.

"'Whom have I the honor of addressing?' he asked in a very gentle voice.

"'Count Bielowsky,' I answered coolly to show him that the difference in
our ages was not sufficient to justify the interrogation.

<span id="page_196">p. 196</span>

"'Well, my dear Count, may your prediction indeed be realized; and I
hope that you will not neglect the Tuileries,' said the guest in the
blue coat, with a smile.

"And he added, finally consenting to present himself:

"'Prince Louis-Napoleon Bonaparte.'

 

"I played no active rôle in the *coup d’état*, and I do not regret it.
It is a principle with me that a stranger should not meddle with the
internal affairs of a country. The prince understood this discretion,
and did not forget the young man who had been of such good omen to him.

"I was one of the first whom he called to the Elysée. My fortune was
definitely established by a defamatory note on 'Napoleon the little.'
The next year, when Mgr. Sibour was out of the way, I was made Gentleman
of the Chamber, and the Emperor was even so kind as to have me marry the
daughter of the Marshal Repeto, Duke of Mondovi.

"I have no scruple in announcing that this union was not what it should
have been. The Countess, who was ten years older than I, was crabbed and
not particularly pretty. Moreover, her family had insisted resolutely on
a marriage portion. Now I had nothing at this time except the
twenty-five thousand pounds for my appointment as Gentleman of the
Chamber. A sad lot for anyone on intimate terms

<span id="page_197">p. 197</span>

with the Count d’Orsay and the Duke of Gramont-Caderousse! Without the
kindness of the Emperor, where would I have been?

 

"One morning in the spring of 1852, I was in my study opening my mail.
There was a letter from His Majesty, calling me to the Tuileries at four
o'clock; a letter from Clémentine, informing me that she expected me at
five o'clock at her house. Clémentine was the beautiful one for whom,
just then, I was ready to commit any folly. I was so proud of her that,
one evening at the *Maison Dorée*, I flaunted her before Prince
Metternich, who was tremendously taken with her. All the court envied me
that conquest; and I was morally obliged to continue to assume its
expenses. And then Clémentine was so pretty! The Emperor himself . . .
The other letters, good lord, the other letters were the bills of the
dressmakers of that young person, who, in spite of my discreet
remonstrances, insisted on having them sent to my conjugal dwelling.

"There were bills for something over forty thousand francs: gowns and
ball dresses from Gagelin-Opigez, 23 Rue de Richelieu; hats and bonnets
from Madame Alexandrine, 14 Rue d’Antin; lingerie and many petticoats
from Madame Pauline, 100 Rue de Clery; dress trimmings and gloves from
the *Ville de Lyon*, 6 Rue de la Chaussée d’Antin; foulards from the
*Malle des Indes;* handkerchiefs from the

<span id="page_198">p. 198</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> *Compagnie
Irlandaise;* laces from Ferguson; cosmetics from *Candès*. . . . This
whitening cream of *Candès*, in particular, overwhelmed me with
stupefaction. The bill showed fifty-one flasks. Six hundred and
twenty-seven francs and fifty centimes’ worth of whitening cream from
*Candès*. . . . Enough to soften the skin of a squadron of a hundred
guards!

"'This can't keep on,' I said, putting the bills in my pocket.

"At ten minutes to four, I crossed the wicket by the Carrousel.

"In the Salon of the *aides de camp* I happened on Bacciochi.

"'The Emperor has the grippe,' he said to me. 'He is keeping to his
room. He has given orders to have you admitted as soon as you arrive.
Come.'

"His Majesty, dressed in a braided vest and Cossack trousers, was
meditating before a window. The pale green of the Tuileries showed
luminously under a gentle warm shower.

"'Ah! Here he is,' said Napoleon. 'Here, have a cigarette. It seems that
you had great doings, you and Gramont-Caderousse, last evening, at the
*Château des Fleurs*.'

"I smiled with satisfaction.

"'So Your Majesty knows already . . .'

"'I know, I know vaguely.'

<span id="page_199">p. 199</span>

"'Do you know Gramont-Caderousse's last "mot"?'

"'No, but you are going to tell it to me.'

"'Here goes, then. We were five or six: myself, Viel-Castel, Gramont,
Persigny . . .'

"'Persigny!' said the Emperor. 'He has no right to associate with
Gramont, after all that Paris says about his wife.'

"'Just so, Sire. Well, Persigny was excited, no doubt about it. He began
telling us how troubled he was because of the Duchess's conduct.'

"'This Fialin isn't over tactful,' murmured the Emperor.

"'Just so, Sire. Then, does Your Majesty know what Gramont hurled at
him?'

"'What?'

"'He said to him, "*Monsieur le Duc*, I forbid you to speak ill of my
mistress before me."

"'Gramont goes too far,' said Napoleon with a dreamy smile.

"'That is what we all thought, including Viel-Castel, who was
nevertheless delighted.'

"'Apropos of this,' said Napoleon after a silence, 'I have forgotten to
ask you for news of the Countess Bielowsky.'

"She is very well, Sire, I thank Your Majesty.'

"'And Clémentine? Still the same dear child?'

"'Always, Sire. But . . .'

<span id="page_200">p. 200</span>

"'It seems that M. Baroche is madly in love with her.'

"'I am very much honored, Sire. But this honor becomes too burdensome.'

"I had drawn from my pocket that morning's bills and I spread them out
under the eyes of the Emperor.

"He looked at them with his distant smile.

"'Come, come. If that is all, I can fix that, since I have a favor to
ask of you.'

"'I am entirely at Your Majesty's service.'

"He struck a gong.

"'Send for M. Mocquard.'

"'I have the grippe,' he said. 'Mocquard will explain the affair to
you.'

"The Emperor's private secretary entered.

"'Here is Bielowsky, Mocquard,' said Napoleon.

'You know what I want him to do. Explain it to him.'

"And he began to tap on the window-panes against which the rain was
beating furiously.

"'My dear Count,' said Mocquard, taking a chair, 'it is very simple. You
have doubtless heard of a young explorer of promise, M. Henry
Duveyrier.'

"I shook my head as a sign of negation, very much surprised at this
beginning.

"'M. Duveyrier,' continued Mocquard, 'has returned to Paris after a
particularly daring trip to South Africa and the Sahara. M. Vivien de
Saint

<span id="page_201">p. 201</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Martin, whom I
have seen recently has assured me that the Geographical Society intends
to confer its great gold medal upon him, in recognition of these
exploits. In the course of his trip, M. Duvreyrier has entered into
negotiations with the chiefs of the people who always have been so
rebellious to His Majesty's armies, the Tuareg.'

"I looked at the Emperor. My bewilderment was such that he began to
laugh.

"'Listen,' he said.

"'M. Duveyrier,' continued Mocquard, 'was able to arrange to have a
delegation of these chiefs come to Paris to present their respects to
His Majesty. Very important results may arise from this visit, and His
Excellency the Colonial Minister, does not despair of obtaining the
signature of a treaty of commerce, reserving special advantages to our
fellow countrymen. These chiefs, five of them, among them Sheik Otham,
*Amenokol* or Sultan of the Confederation of Adzger, arrive to-morrow
morning at the *Gare de Lyon*. M. Duveyrier will meet them. But the
Emperor has thought that besides . . .'

"'I thought,' said Napoleon III, delighted by my bewilderment, 'I
thought that it was correct to have some one of the Gentlemen of my
Chamber wait upon the arrival of these Mussulman dignitaries. That is
why you are here, my poor Bielowsky. Don't be frightened,' he added,
laughing harder. 'You will have M. Duveyrier with you. You are

<span id="page_202">p. 202</span>

charged only with the special part of the reception: to accompany these
princes to the lunch that I am giving them to-morrow at the Tuileries;
then, in the evening, discreetly on account of their religious scruples,
to succeed in giving them a very high idea of Parisian civilization,
with nothing exaggerated: do not forget that in the Sahara they are very
high religious dignitaries. In that respect, I have confidence in your
tact and give you *carte blanche*. . . . Mocquard!'

"'Sire?'

"'You will apportion on the budget, half to Foreign Affairs, half to the
Colonies, the funds Count Bielowsky will need for the reception of the
Tuareg delegation. It seems to me that a hundred thousand francs, to
begin . . . The Count has only to tell you if he is forced to exceed
that figure.'

 

"Clémentine lived on the Rue Boccador, in a little Moorish pavillion
that I had bought for her from M. de Lesseps. I found her in bed. When
she saw me, she burst into tears.

"'Great fools that we are!' she murmured amidst her sobs, 'what have we
done!'

"'Clémentine, tell me!'

"'What have we done, what have we done!' she repeated, and I felt
against me, her floods of black hair, her warm cheek which was fragrant
with *eau de Nanon*.

<span id="page_203">p. 203</span>

"'What is it? What can it be?'

"'It is . . .' and she murmured something in my ear.

"'No!' I said, stupefied. 'Are you quite sure?'

"'Am I quite sure!'

"I was thunderstruck.

"'You don't seem much pleased,' she said sharply.

"'I did not say that. . . . Though, really, I am very much pleased, I
assure you.'

"Prove it to me: let us spend the day together to-morrow.'

"'To-morrow!' I stammered. 'Impossible!'

"'Why?' she demanded suspiciously.

"'Because to-morrow, I have to pilot the Tuareg mission about Paris. The
Emperor's orders.'

"'What bluff is this?' asked Clémentine.

"'I admit that nothing so much resembles a lie as the truth.'

"I retold Mocquard's story to Clémentine, as well as I could. She
listened to me with an expression that said: 'you can't fool me that
way.'

"Finally, furious, I burst out:

"'You can see for yourself. I am dining with them, to-morrow; and I
invite you.'

"'I shall be very pleased to come,' said Clémentine with great dignity.

"I admit that I lacked self-control at that minute. But think what a day
it had been! Forty thousand francs of bills as soon as I woke up. The
ordeal of

<span id="page_204">p. 204</span>

escorting the savages around Paris all the next day. And, quite
unexpectedly, the announcement of an approaching irregular paternity. .
. .

"'After all,' I thought, as I returned to my house, 'these are the
Emperor's orders. He has commanded me to give the Tuareg an idea of
Parisian civilization. Clémentine comports herself very well in society
and just now it would not do to aggravate her. I will engage a room for
to-morrow at the *Café de Paris*, and tell Gramont-Caderousse and
Viel-Castel to bring their silly mistresses. It will be very French to
enjoy the attitude of these children of the desert in the midst of this
little party.'

"The train from Marseilles arrived at 10:20. On the platform I found M.
Duveyrier, a young man of twenty-three with blue eyes and a little blond
beard. The Tuareg fell into his arms as they descended from the train.
He had lived with them for two years, in their tents, the devil knows
where. He presented me to their chief, Sheik Otham, and to four others,
splendid fellows in their blue cotton draperies and their amulets of red
leather. Fortunately, they all spoke a kind of *sabir* <span
id="fr_13"></span>[1](#fn_13.md) which helped things along.

"I only mention in passing the lunch at the Tuileries, the visits in the
evening to the Museum, to the *Hotel de Ville*, to the Imperial Printing
Press. Each

<span id="page_205">p. 205</span>

time, the Tuareg inscribed their names in the registry of the place they
were visiting. It was interminable. To give you an idea, here is the
complete name of Sheik Otham alone:
Otham-ben-el-Hadj-el-Bekri-ben-el-Hadj-el-Faqqi-ben-Mohammad-Bouyaben-si-Ahmed-es-Souki-ben-Mahmoud. <span
id="fr_14"></span>[1](#fn_14.md)

"And there were five of them like that!

"I maintained my good humor, however, because on the boulevards,
everywhere, our success was colossal. At the *Café de Paris*, at
six-thirty, it amounted to frenzy. The delegation, a little drunk,
embraced me: '*Bono, Napoléon; bono, Eugénie; bono, Casimir; bono,
Christians*.' Gramont-Caderousse and Viel Castel were already in booth
number eight, with Anna Grimaldi, of the *Folies Dramatiques*, and
Hortense Schneider, both beautiful enough to strike terror to the heart.
But the palm was for my dear Clémentine, when she entered. I must tell
you how she was dressed: a gown of white tulle, over China blue
tarletan, with pleatings, and ruffles of tulle over the pleatings. The
tulle skirt was caught up on each side by garlands of green leaves
mingled with rose clusters. Thus it formed a valence which allowed the
tarletan skirt to show in front and on the sides. The garlands were
caught

<span id="page_206">p. 206</span>

up to the belt and, in the space between their branches, were knots of
rose satin with long ends. The pointed bodice was draped with tulle, the
billowy bertha of tulle was edged with lace. By way of head-dress, she
had placed upon her black locks a diadem crown of the same flowers. Two
long leafy tendrils were twined in her hair and fell on her neck. As
cloak, she had a kind of scarf of blue cashmere embroidered in gold and
lined with blue satin.

"So much beauty and splendor immediately moved the Tuareg and,
especially, Clémentine's right-hand neighbor, El-Hadj-ben-Guemama,
brother of Sheik Otham and Sultan of Ahaggar. By the time the soup
arrived, a bouillon of wild game, seasoned with Tokay, he was already
much smitten. When they served the compote of fruits Martinique *à la
liqueur de Mme. Amphoux*, he showed every indication of illimitable
passion. The Cyprian wine *de la Commanderie* made him quite sure of his
sentiments. Hortense kicked my foot under the table. Gramont, intending
to do the same to Anna, made a mistake and aroused the indignant
protests of one of the Tuareg. I can safely say that when the time came
to go to Mabille, we were enlightened as to the manner in which our
visitors respected the prohibition decreed by the Prophet in respect to
wine.

"At Mabille, while Clémentine, Hortense, Anna, Ludovic and the three
Tuareg gave themselves over

<span id="page_207">p. 207</span>

to the wildest gallops, Sheik Otham took me aside and confided to me,
with visible emotion, a certain commission with which he had just been
charged by his brother, Sheik Ahmed.

 

"The next day, very early, I reached Clémentine's house.

"'My dear,' I began, after having waked her, not without difficulty,
'listen to me. I want to talk to you seriously.'

"She rubbed her eyes a bit crossly.

"'How did you like that young Arabian gentleman who was so taken with
you last night?'

"'Why, well enough,' she said, blushing.

"'Do you know that in his country, he is the sovereign prince and reigns
over territories five or six times greater than those of our august
master, the Emperor Napoleon III?'

"'He murmured something of that kind to me,' she said, becoming
interested.

"'Well, would it please you to mount on a throne, like our august
sovereign, the Empress Eugénie?'

"Clémentine looked startled.

"'His own brother, Sheik Otham, has charged me in his name to make this
offer.'

"Clémentine, dumb with amazement, did not reply.

"'I, Empress!' she finally stammered.

"'The decision rests with you. They must have

<span id="page_208">p. 208</span>

your answer before midday. If it is 'yes,' we lunch together at
Voisin's, and the bargain is made.'

"I saw that she had already made up her mind, but she thought it well to
display a little sentiment.

"'And you, you!' she groaned. "To leave you thus. . . . Never!'

"'No foolishness, dear child,' I said gently. 'You don't know perhaps
that I am ruined. Yes, completely: I don't even know how I am going to
pay for your complexion cream!'

"'Ah!' she sighed

"She added, however, 'And . . . the child?'

"'What child?'

"'Our child . . . our child.'

"'Ah! That is so. Why, you will nave to put it down to profit and loss.
I am even convinced that Sheik Ahmed will find that it resembles him.'

"'You can turn everything into a joke,' she said between laughing and
crying.

 

"The next morning, at the same hour, the Marseilles express carried away
the five Tuareg and Clémentine. The young woman, radiant, was leaning on
the arm of Sheik Ahmed, who was beside himself with joy.

"'Have you many shops in your capital?' she asked him languidly.

"And he, smiling broadly under his veil, replied:

"'*Besef, besef, bono, roumis, bono*.'

<span id="page_209">p. 209</span>

"At the last moment, Clémentine had a pang of emotion.

"'Listen, Casimir, you have always been kind to me. I am going to be a
queen. If you weary of it here, promise me, swear to me . . .'

"The Sheik had understood. He took a ring from his finger and slipped it
onto mine.

"'Sidi Casimir, comrade,' he affirmed. 'You come—find us. Take Sidi
Ahmed's ring and show it. Everybody at Ahaggar comrades. *Bono* Ahaggar,
*bono*.'

"When I came out of the *Gare de Lyon*, I had the feeling of having
perpetrated an excellent joke."

 

The Hetman of Jitomir was completely drunk. I had had the utmost
difficulty in understanding the end of his story, because he
interjected, every other moment, couplets from Jacques Offenbach's best
score.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

*Dans un bois passait un jeune homme,  
Un jeune homme frais et beau,  
Sa main tenait une pomme,  
Vous voyez d’ici le tableau*.

</div>

"Who was disagreeably surprised by the fall of Sedan? It was Casimir,
poor old Casimir! Five thousand louis to pay by the fifth of September,
and not the first sou, no, not the first sou. I take my hat

<span id="page_210">p. 210</span>

and my courage and go to the Tuileries. No more Emperor there, no! But
the Empress was so kind. I found her alone—ah, people scatter quickly
under such circumstances I—alone with a senator, M. Mérimée, the only
literary man I have ever known who was at the same time a man of the
world. 'Madame,' he was saying to her, 'you must give up all hope. M.
Thiers, whom I just met on the Pont Royal, would listen to nothing.'

"'Madame,' I said in my turn, 'Your Majesty always will know where her
true friends are.'

"And I kissed her hand.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

     "*Evohé, que les déesses  
     Ont de droles de façons  
Pour enjôler, pour enjôler, pour enjôler les gaâarçons!*

</div>

"I returned to my home in the Rue de Lille. On the way I encountered the
rabble going from the *Corps Législatif* to the Hotel de Ville. My mind
was made up.

"'Madame,' I said to my wife, 'my pistols.'

"'What is the matter?' she asked, frightened.

"'All is lost. But there is still a chance to preserve my honor. I am
going to be killed on the barricades.'

"'Ah! Casimir,' she sobbed, falling into my

<span id="page_211">p. 211</span>

arms. 'I have misjudged you. Will you forgive me?'

"'I forgive you, Aurelie,' I said with dignified emotion. 'I have not
always been right myself.'

"I tore myself away from this mad scene. It was six o'clock. On the Rue
de Bac, I hailed a cab on its mad career.

"'Twenty francs tip,' I said to the coachman, 'if you get to the *Gare
de Lyon* in time for the Marseilles train, six thirty-seven.' "

The Hetman of Jitomir could say no more. He had rolled over on the
cushions and slept with clenched fists.

I walked unsteadily to the great window.

The sun was rising, pale yellow, behind the sharp blue mountains.
