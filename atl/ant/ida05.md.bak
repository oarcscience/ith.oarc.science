### CHAPTER III

#### THE MORHANGE-SAINT-AVIT MISSION

"<span class="smallcaps">So</span> I killed Captain Morhange," André de
Saint-Avit said to me the next day, at the same time, in the same place,
with a calm that took no account of the night, the frightful night I had
just been through. "Why do I tell you this? I don't know in the least.
Because of the desert, perhaps. Are you a man capable of enduring the
weight of that confidence, and further, if necessary, of assuming the
consequences it may bring? I don't know that, either. The future will
decide. For the present there is only one thing certain, the fact, I
tell you again, that I killed Captain Morhange.

I killed him. And, since you want me to specify the reason, you
understand that I am not going to torture my brain to turn it into a
romance for you, or commence by recounting in the naturalistic manner of
what stuff my first trousers were made, or, as the neo-Catholics would
have it, how often I went as a child to confession, and how much I liked
doing it. I have no taste for useless exhibitions.

<span id="page_44">p. 44</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> You will find that
this recital begins strictly at the time when I met Morhange.

And first of all, I tell you, however much it has cost my peace of mind
and my reputation, I do not regret having known him. In a word, apart
from all question of false friendship, I am convicted of a black
ingratitude in having killed him. It is to him, it is to his knowledge
of rock inscriptions, that I owe the only thing that has raised my life
in interest above the miserable little lives dragged out by my
companions at Auxonne, and elsewhere.

This being understood, here are the facts:

It was in the Arabian Office at Wargla, when I was a lieutenant, that I
first heard the name, Morhange. And I must add that it was for me the
occasion of an attack of bad humor. We were having difficult times. The
hostility of the Sultan of Morocco was latent. At Touat, where the
assassination of Flatters and of Frescaly had already been concocted,
connivance was being given to the plots of our enemies. Touat was the
center of conspiracies, of razzias, of defections, and at the same time,
the depot of supply for the insatiable nomads. The Governors of Algeria,
Tirman, Cambon, Laferriere, demanded its occupation. The Ministers of
War tacitly agreed. . . . But there was Parliament, which did nothing at
all, because of England, because of Germany, and above all because of a
certain *Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the* 

<span id="page_45">p. 45</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> *Citizen*, which
prescribed that insurrection is the most sacred of duties, even when the
insurgents are savages who cut your head off. In short, the military
authority could only, at its own discretion, increase the southern
garrisons, and establish new posts; this one, Berresof, Hassi-el-Mia,
Fort MacMahon, Fort Lallemand, Fort Miribel. . . . But as Castries puts
it, you don't hold the nomads with bordjs, you hold them by the belt.
The middle was the oasis of Touat. Their honors, the lawyers of Paris,
had to be convinced of the necessity of taking possession of the oasis
of Touat. The best way would be to present them with a faithful picture
of the plots that were being woven there against us.

The principal authors were, and still are, the Senoussis, whose able
chief has been forced by our arms to transfer the seat of his
confederation several thousand leagues from there, to Schimmedrou, in
the Tibesti. They had, I say *they* through modesty, the idea of
ascertaining the traces left by these agitators on their favorite places
of concourse; Rhat, Temassinin, the plain of Adejamor, and In-Salah. It
was, you see, at least after leaving Temassinin, practically the same
itinerary as that followed in 1864 by General Rohlfs.

I had already attracted some attention by two excursions, one to Agades,
and the other to Bilma, and was considered by the staff officers to be
one of the

<span id="page_46">p. 46</span>

best informed on the Senoussis question. I was therefore selected to
assume this new task.

I then suggested that it would be of interest to kill two birds with one
stone, and to get, in passing, an idea of the northern Ahoggar, so as to
make sure whether the Tuaregs of Ahitarhen had continued to have as
cordial relations with the Senoussis as they had had when they combined
to massacre the Flatters’ mission. I was immediately accorded the
permission. The change in my first plan was as follows: After reaching
Ighelaschem, six hundred kilometers south of Temassinin, instead of
taking the direct road to Touat via Rhat, I would, penetrating between
the high land of Mouydir and Ahaggar, strike off to the southwest as far
as Shikh-Salah. There I would turn again northwards, towards In-Salah,
by the road to the Soudan and Agades. In all hardly eight kilometers
additional in a trip of about seven hundred leagues, with the certainty
of making as complete an examination as possible of the roads which our
enemies, the Senoussis of Tibesti and the Tuareg of the Ahoggar, must
follow to arrive at Touat. On the way, for every explorer has his pet
fancy, I was not at all displeased to think that I would have a chance
to examine the geological formation of the plateau of Egere, about which
Duveyrier and the others are so disappointingly indefinite.

Everything was ready for my departure from

<span id="page_47">p. 47</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Wargla.
Everything, which is to say, very little. Three mehara: mine, my
companion Bou-Djema's (a faithful Chaamba, whom I had had with me in my
wanderings through the Air, less of a guide in the country I was
familiar with than a machine for saddling and unsaddling camels), then a
third to carry provisions and skins of drinking water, very little,
since I had taken pains to locate the stops with reference to the wells.

Some people go equipped for this kind of expedition with a hundred
regulars, and even cannon. I am for the tradition of Douls and René
Callie, I go alone.

I was at that perfect moment when only one thin thread still held me to
the civilized world when an official cable arrived at Wargla.

"Lieutenant de Saint-Avit," it said briefly, "will delay his departure
until the arrival of Captain Morhange, who will accompany him on his
expedition of exploration."

I was more than disappointed. I alone had had the idea of this
expedition. I had had all the difficulty that you can imagine to make
the authorities agree to it. And now when I was rejoicing at the idea of
the long hours I would spend alone with myself in the heart of the
desert, they sent me a stranger, and, to make matters worse, a superior.

The condolences of my comrades aggravated my bad humor.

<span id="page_48">p. 48</span>

The Yearly Report, consulted on the spot, had given them the following
information:

"Morhange (Jean-Marie-François), class of 1881. Breveted. Captain,
unassigned. (Topographical Service of the Army.)"

"There is the explanation for you," said one. "They are sending one of
their creatures to pull the chestnuts out of the fire, after you have
had all the trouble of making it. Breveted! That's a great way. The
theories of Ardant du Picq or else nothing about here."

"I don't altogether agree with you," said the Major. "They knew in
Parliament, for some one is always indiscreet, the real aim of
Saint-Avit's mission: to force their hand for the occupation of Touat.
And this Morhange must be a man serving the interests of the Army
Commission. All these people, secretaries, members of Parliament,
governors, keep a close watch on each other. Some one will write an
amusing paradoxical history some day, of the French Colonial Expansion,
which is made without the knowledge of the powers in office, when it is
not actually in spite of them."

"Whatever the reason, the result will be the same," I said bitterly; "we
will be two Frenchmen to spy on each other night and day, along the
roads to the south. An amiable prospect when one has none too much time
to foil all the tricks of the natives. When does he arrive?"

<span id="page_49">p. 49</span>

"Day after tomorrow, probably. I have news of a convoy coming from
Ghardaia. It is likely that he will avail himself of it. The indications
are that he doesn't know very much about traveling alone."

Captain Morhange did arrive in fact two days later by means of the
convoy from Ghardaia. I was the first person for whom he asked.

When he came to my room, whither I had withdrawn in dignity as soon as
the convoy was sighted, I was disagreeably surprised to foresee that I
would have great difficulty in preserving my prejudice against him.

He was tall, his face full and ruddy, with laughing blue eyes, a small
black moustache, and hair that was already white.

"I have a thousand apologies to make to you, my dear fellow," he said
immediately, with a frankness that I have never seen in any other man.
"You must be furious with my importunity in upsetting your plans and
delaying your departure."

"By no means, Captain," I replied coolly.

"You really have only yourself to blame. It is on account of your
knowledge of the southern routes, so highly esteemed at Paris, that I
wished to have you to initiate me when the Ministries of Instruction and
of Commerce, and the Geographical Society combined to charge me with the
mission which brings me here. These three honorable institutions have

<span id="page_50">p. 50</span>

in fact entrusted me with the attempt to re-establish the ancient track
of the caravans, which, from the ninth century, trafficked between Tunis
and the Soudan, by Toweur, Wargla, Es-Souk and the bend of the Bourroum;
and to study the possibility of restoring this route to its ancient
splendor. At the same time, at the Geographic Bureau, I heard of the
journey that you are undertaking. From Wargla to Shikh-Salah our two
itineraries are the same. Only I must admit to you that it is the first
voyage of this kind that I have ever undertaken. I would not be afraid
to hold forth for an hour on Arabian literature in the amphitheatre of
the School of Oriental Languages, but I know well enough that in the
desert I should have to ask for directions whether to turn right or
left. This is the only chance which could give me such an opportunity,
and at the same time put me under obligation for this introduction to so
charming a companion. You must not blame me if I seized it, if I used
all my influence to retard your departure from Wargla until the instant
when I could join you. I have only one more word to add to what I have
said. I am entrusted with a mission which by its origin is rendered
essentially civilian. You are sent out by the Ministry of War. Up to the
moment when, arrived at Shikh-Salah we turn our backs on each other to
attain, you Touat, and I the Niger, all your recommendations, all your
orders, will be followed

<span id="page_51">p. 51</span>

by a subaltern, and, I hope, by a friend as well."

All the time he was talking so openly I felt delightedly my worst recent
fears melting away. Nevertheless, I still experienced a mean desire to
show him some marks of reserve, for having thus disposed of my company
at a distance, without consulting me.

"I am very grateful to you, Captain, for your extremely flattering
words. When do you wish to leave Wargla?"

He made a gesture of complete detachment.

"Whenever you like. Tomorrow, this evening. I have already delayed you.
Your preparations must have already been made for some time."

My little maneuver had turned against myself. I had not been counting on
leaving before the next week.

"Tomorrow, Captain, but your luggage?" He smiled delightfully.

"I thought it best to bring as little as possible. A light pack, some
papers. My brave camel had no difficulty in bringing it along. For the
rest I depend on your advice, and the resources of Owargla."

I was well caught. I had nothing further to say. And moreover, such
freedom of spirit and manner had already captivated me.

"It seems," said my comrades, when the time for aperitives had brought
us all together again, "that

<span id="page_52">p. 52</span>

this Captain of yours is a remarkably charming fellow."

"Remarkably."

"You surely can't have any trouble with him. It is only up to you to see
that later on he doesn't get all the glory."

"We aren't working with the same end in view," I answered evasively.

I was thoughtful, only thoughtful I give you my word. From that moment I
harbored no further grudge against Morhange. Yet my silence persuaded
him that I was unforgiving. And everyone,

do you hear me, everyone said later on, when suspicions became rife:

"He is surely guilty. We saw them go off together. We can affirm it."

I am guilty. . . . But for a low motive of jealousy. . . . How
sickening. . . .

After that, there was nothing to do but to flee, flee, as far as the
places where there are no more men who think and reason.

Morhange appeared, his arm resting on the Major's, who was beaming over
this new acquaintanceship.

He presented him enthusiastically:

"Captain Morhange, gentlemen. An officer of the old school, and a man
after our own hearts, I give you my word. He wants to leave tomorrow,
but we must give him such a reception that he will

<span id="page_53">p. 53</span>

forget that idea before two days are up. Come, Captain, you have at
least eight days to give us."

"I am at the disposition of Lieutenant de Saint-Avit," replied Morhange,
with a quiet smile.

The conversation became general. The sound of glasses and laughter rang
out. I heard my comrades in ecstasies over the stories that the newcomer
poured out with never-failing humor. And I, never, never have I felt so
sad.

The time came to pass into the dining-room.

"At my right, Captain," cried the Major, more and more beaming. "And I
hope you will keep on giving us these new lines on Paris. We are not up
with the times here, you know."

"Yours to command, Major," said Morhange. "Be seated, gentlemen."

The officers obeyed, with a joyous clatter of moving chairs. I had not
taken my eyes off Morhange, who was still standing.

"Major, gentlemen, you will allow me," he said.

And before sitting down at that table, where every moment he was the
life of the party, in a low voice, with his eyes closed, Captain
Morhange recited the Benedicite.
