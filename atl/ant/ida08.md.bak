### CHAPTER VI

#### THE DISASTER OF THE LETTUCE

<span class="smallcaps">As</span> Eg-Anteouen and Bou-Djema came face to
face, I fancied that both the Targa and the [Chaamba](errata.htm#5.md) gave
a sudden start which each immediately repressed. It was nothing more
than a fleeting impression. Nevertheless, it was enough to make me
resolve that as soon as I was alone with our guide,

I would question him closely concerning our new companion.

The beginning of the day had been wearisome enough. 'We decided,
therefore, to spend the rest of it there, and even to pass the night in
the cave, waiting till the flood had completely subsided.

In the morning, when I was marking our day's march upon the map,
Morhange came toward me. I noticed that his manner was somewhat
restrained.

"In three days, we shall be at Shikh-Salah," I said to him. "Perhaps by
the evening of the second day, badly as the camels go."

"Perhaps we shall separate before then," he muttered.

<span id="page_85">p. 85</span>

"How so?"

"You see, I have changed my itinerary a little. I have given up the idea
of going straight to Timissao. First I should like to make a little
excursion into the interior of the Ahaggar range."

I frowned:

"What is this new idea?"

As I spoke I looked about for Eg-Anteouen, whom I had seen in
conversation with Morhange the previous evening and several minutes
before. He was quietly mending one of his sandals with a waxed thread
supplied by Bou-Djema. He did not raise his head.

"It is simply," explained Morhange, less and less at his ease, "that
this man tells me there are similar inscriptions in several caverns in
western Ahaggar. These caves are near the road that he has to take
returning home. He must pass by Tit. Now, from Tit, by way of Silet, is
hardly two hundred kilometers. It is a quasi-classic route <span
id="fr_5"></span>[1](#fn_5.md) as short again as the one that I shall have
to take alone, after I leave you, from Shikh-Salah to Timissao. That is
in part, you see, the reason which has made me decide to . . ."

"In part? In very small part," I replied. "But is your mind absolutely
made up?"

<span id="page_86">p. 86</span>

"It is," he answered me.

"When do you expect to leave me?"

"To-day. The road which Eg-Anteouen proposes to take into Ahaggar
crosses this one about four leagues from here. I have a favor to ask of
you in this connection."

"Please tell me."

"It is to let me take one of the two baggage camels, since my Targa has
lost his."

"The camel which carries your baggage belongs to you as much as does
your own mehari," I answered coldly.

We stood there several minutes without speaking. Morhange maintained an
uneasy silence; I was examining my map. All over it in greater or less
degree, but particularly towards the south, the unexplored portions of
Ahaggar stood out as far too numerous white patches in the tan area of
supposed mountains.

I finally said:

"You give me your word that when you have seen these famous grottos, you
will make straight for Timissao by Tit and Silet?"

He looked at me uncomprehendingly.

"Why do you ask that?"

"Because, if you promise me that,—provided, of course, that my company
is not unwelcome to you—I will go with you. Either way, I shall have two
hundred kilometers to go. I shall strike for Shikh-Salah

<span id="page_87">p. 87</span>

from the south, instead of from the west—that is the only difference."

Morhange looked at me with emotion.

"Why do you do this?" he murmured.

"My dear fellow," I said (it was the first time that I had addressed
Morhange in this familiar way), "my dear fellow, I have a sense which
becomes marvellously acute in the desert, the sense of danger. I gave
you a slight proof of it yesterday morning, at the coming of the storm.
With all your knowledge of rock inscriptions, you seem to me to have no
very exact idea of what kind of place Ahaggar is, nor what may be in
store for you there. On that account, I should be just as well pleased
not to let you run sure risks alone."

"I have a guide," he said with his adorable naiveté.

Eg-Anteouen, in the same squatting position, kept on patching his old
slipper.

I took a step toward him.

"You heard what I said to the Captain?"

"Yes," the Targa answered calmly.

"I am going with him. We leave you at Tit, to which place you must bring
us. Where is the place you proposed to show the Captain?"

"I did not propose to show it to him; it was his own idea," said the
Targa coldly. "The grottos with the inscriptions are three-days’ march
southward in the mountains. At first, the road is rather rough.

<span id="page_88">p. 88</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> But farther on, it
turns, and you gain Timissao very easily. There are good wells where the
Tuareg Taitoqs, who are friendly to the French, come to water their
camels."

"And you know the road well?"

He shrugged his shoulders. His eyes had a scornful smile.

"I have taken it twenty times," he said.

"In that case, let's get started."

We rode for two hours. I did not exchange a word with Morhange. I had a
clear intuition of the folly we were committing in risking ourselves so
unconcernedly in that least known and most dangerous part of the Sahara.
Every blow which had been struck in the last twenty years to undermine
the French advance had come from this redoubtable Ahaggar. But what of
it? It was of my own will that I had joined in this mad scheme. No need
of going over it again. What was the use of spoiling my action by a
continual exhibition of disapproval? And, furthermore, I may as well
admit that I rather liked the turn that our trip was beginning to take.
I had, at that instant, the sensation of journeying toward something
incredible, toward some tremendous adventure. You do not live with
impunity for months and years as the guest of the desert. Sooner or
later, it has its way with you, annihilates the good officer, the timid
executive, overthrows his solicitude for his responsibilities. What is
there behind those

<span id="page_89">p. 89</span>

mysterious rocks, those dim solitudes, which have held at bay the most
illustrious pursuers of mystery? You follow, I tell you, you follow.

 

"Are you sure at least that this inscription is interesting enough to
justify us in our undertaking?" I asked Morhange.

My companion started with pleasure. Ever since we began our journey I
had realized his fear that I was coming along half-heartedly. As soon as
I offered him a chance to convince me, his scruples vanished, and his
triumph seemed assured to him.

"Never," he answered, in a voice that he tried to control, but through
which the enthusiasm rang out, "never has a Greek inscription been found
so far south. The farthest points where they have been reported are in
the south of Algeria and Cyrene. But in Ahaggar! Think of it! It is true
that this one is translated into Tifinar. But this peculiarity does not
diminish the interest of the coincidence: it increases it."

"What do you take to be the meaning of this word?"

"*Antinea* can only be a proper name," said Morhange. "To whom does it
refer? I admit I don't know, and if at this very moment I am marching
toward the south, dragging you along with me, it is because I count on
learning more about it. Its etymology? It hasn't one definitely, but
there are thirty

<span id="page_90">p. 90</span>

possibilities. Bear in mind that the Tifinar alphabet is far from
tallying with the Greek alphabet, which increases the number of
hypotheses. Shall I suggest several?"

"I was just about to ask you to."

"To begin with, there is ἀντι and ναῦς *the woman who is placed opposite
a vessel*, an explanation which would have been pleasing to Gaffarel and
to my venerated master Berlioux. That would apply well enough to the
figure-heads of ships. There is a technical term that I cannot recall at
this moment, not if you beat me a hundred times over. <span
id="fr_6"></span>[1](#fn_6.md)

"Then there is ἀντινηα, that you must relate to ἀντι and ναός, *she who
holds herself before the* ναός, the ναός of the temple, *she who is
opposite the sanctuary*, therefore priestess. An interpretation which
would enchant Girard and Renan.

"Next we have ἀντινέ from ἀντι and νέος, *new*, which can mean two
things: either she who is the contrary of young, which is to say old; or
she who is the enemy of novelty or the enemy of youth.

There is still another sense of ᾽νατί, in exchange for, which is capable
of complicating all the others I have mentioned; likewise there are four
meanings for the verb νἐω, which means in turn

<span id="page_91">p. 91</span>

*to go,* *to flow*, *to thread* or *weave*, *to heap*. There is more
still. . . . And notice, please, that I have not at my disposition on
the otherwise commodious hump of this mehari, either the great
dictionary of Estienne or the lexicons of Passow, of Pape, or of
Liddel-Scott. This is only to show you, my dear friend, that epigraphy
is but a relative science, always dependent on the discovery of a new
text which contradicts the previous findings, when it is not merely at
the mercy of the humors of the epigraphists and their pet conceptions of
the universe. <span id="fr_7"></span>[1](#fn_7.md)

"That was rather my view of it," I said. "But I must admit my
astonishment to find that, with such a sceptical opinion of the goal,
you still do not hesitate to take risks which may be quite
considerable."

Morhange smiled wanly.

"I do not interpret, my friend; I collect. From what I will take back to
him, Dom Granger has the ability to draw conclusions which are beyond my
slight knowledge. I was amusing myself a little. Pardon me."

Just then the girth of one of the baggage camels, evidently not well
fastened, came loose. Part of the load slipped and fell to the ground.

<span id="page_92">p. 92</span>

Eg-Anteouen descended instantly from his beast and helped Bou-Djema
repair the damage.

When they had finished, I made my mehari walk beside Bou-Djema's.

"It will be better to resaddle the camels at the next stop. They will
have to climb the mountain."

The guide looked at me with amazement. Up to that time I had thought it
unnecessary to acquaint him with our new projects. But I supposed
Eg-Anteouen would have told him.

"Lieutenant, the road across the white plain to Shikh-Salah is not
mountainous," said the Chaamba.

"We are not keeping to the road across the white plain. We are going
south, by Ahaggar."

"By Ahaggar," he murmured. "But . . ."

"But what?"

"I do not know the road."

"Eg-Anteouen is going to guide us."

"Eg-Anteouen!"

I watched Bou-Djema as he made this suppressed ejaculation. His eyes
were fixed on the Targa with a mixture of stupor and fright.

Eg-Anteouen's camel was a dozen yards ahead of us, side by side with
Morhange's. The two men were talking. I realized that Morhange must be
conversing with Eg-Anteouen about the famous inscriptions. But we were
not so far behind that they could not have overheard our words.

<span id="page_93">p. 93</span>

Again I looked at my guide. I saw that he was pale.

"What is it, Bou-Djema?" I asked in a low voice.

"Not here, Lieutenant, not here," he muttered.

His teeth chattered. He added in a whisper:

"Not here. This evening, when we stop, when he turns to the East to
pray, when the sun goes down. Then, call me to you. I will tell you. . .
. But not here. He is talking, but he is listening. Go ahead. Join the
Captain."

"What next?" I murmured, pressing my camel's neck with my foot so as to
make him overtake Morhange.

 

It was about five o'clock when Eg-Anteouen who was leading the way, came
to a stop.

"Here it is," he said, getting down from his camel.

It was a beautiful and sinister place. To our left a fantastic wall of
granite outlined its gray ribs against the sky. This wall was pierced,
from top to bottom, by a winding corridor about a thousand feet high and
scarcely wide enough in places to allow three camels to walk abreast.

"Here it is," repeated the Targa.

To the west, straight behind us, the track that we were leaving unrolled
like a pale ribbon. The white plain, the road to Shikh-Salah, the
established halts, the well-known wells. . . . And, on the other side,

<span id="page_94">p. 94</span>

this black wall against the mauve sky, this dark passage.

I looked at Morhange.

"We had better stop here," he said simply. "Eg-Anteouen advises us to
take as much water here as we can carry."

With one accord we decided to spend the night there, before undertaking
the mountain.

There was a spring, in a dark basin, from which fell a little cascade;
there were a few shrubs, a few plants.

Already the camels were browsing at the length of their tethers.

Bou-Djema arranged our camp dinner service of tin cups and plates on a
great flat stone. An opened tin of meat lay beside a plate of lettuce
which he had just gathered from the moist earth around the spring. I
could tell from the distracted manner in which he placed these objects
upon the rock how deep was his anxiety.

As he was bending toward me to hand me a plate, he pointed to the gloomy
black corridor which we were about to enter.

"*Blad-el-Khouf!*" he murmured.

"What did he say?" asked Morhange, who had seen the gesture.

"*Blad-el-Khouf*. *This is the country of fear*. That is what the Arabs
call Ahaggar."

Bou-Djema went a little distance off and sat down,

<span id="page_95">p. 95</span>

leaving us to our dinner. Squatting on his heels, he began to eat a few
lettuce leaves that he had kept for his own meal.

Eg-Anteouen was still motionless.

Suddenly the Targa rose. The sun in the west was no larger than a red
brand. We saw Eg-Anteouen approach the fountain, spread his blue burnous
on the ground and kneel upon it.

"I did not suppose that the Tuareg were so observant of Mussulman
tradition," said Morhange. "Nor I," I replied thoughtfully.

But I had something to do at that moment besides making such
speculations.

"Bou-Djema," I called.

At the same time, I looked at Eg-Anteouen. Absorbed in his prayer, bowed
toward the west, apparently he was paying no attention to me. As he
prostrated himself, I called again.

"Bou-Djema, come with me to my mehari; I want to get something out of
the saddle bags."

Still kneeling, Eg-Anteouen was mumbling his prayer slowly, composedly.

But Bou-Djema had not budged.

His only response was a deep moan.

Morhange and I leaped to our feet and ran to the guide. Eg-Anteouen
reached him as soon as we did.

With his eyes closed and his limbs already cold, the Chaamba breathed a
death rattle in Morhange's arms. I had seized one of his hands.
Eg-Anteouen

<span id="page_96">p. 96</span>

took the other. Each, in his own way, was trying to divine, to
understand. . . .

Suddenly Eg-Anteouen leapt to his feet. He had just seen the poor
embossed bowl which the Arab had held an instant before between his
knees, and which now lay overturned upon the ground.

He picked it up, looked quickly at one after another of the leaves of
lettuce remaining in it, and then gave a hoarse exclamation.

"So," said Morhange, "it's his turn now; he is going to go mad."

Watching Eg-Anteouen closely, I saw him hasten without a word to the
rock where our dinner was set, a second later, he was again beside us,
holding out the bowl of lettuce which he had not yet touched.

Then he took a thick, long, pale green leaf from Bou-Djema's bowl and
held it beside another leaf he had just taken from our bowl.

"*Afahlehle*," was all he said.

I shuddered, and so did Morhange. It was the *afahlehla*, the
*falestez*, of the Arabs of the Sahara, the terrible plant which had
killed a part of the Flatters mission more quickly and surely than
Tuareg arms.

Eg-Anteouen stood up. His tall silhouette was outlined blackly against
the sky which suddenly had turned pale lilac. He was watching us.

We bent again over the unfortunate guide.

<span id="page_97">p. 97</span>

"*Afahlehle*," the Targa repeated, and shook his head.

 

Bou-Djema died in the middle of the night without having regained
consciousness.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_5"></span>[85:1](ida08.htm#fr_5.md) The route and the stages
from Tit to Timissao were actually plotted out, as early as 1888, by
Captain Bissuel. *Les Tuareg de l’Ouest*, itineraries 1 and 10. (Note by
M. Leroux.)

<span id="fn_6"></span>[90:1](ida08.htm#fr_6.md) It is perhaps worth noting
here that *Figures de Proues* is the exact title of a very remarkable
collection of poems by Mme. Delarus-Mardrus. (Note by M. Leroux.)

<span id="fn_7"></span>[91:1](ida08.htm#fr_7.md) Captain Morhange seems to
have forgotten in this enumeration, in places fanciful, the etymology of
ἀνθίνεα, a Doric dialect form of ἀνθινὴ, from ἄνθος, *a flower*, and
which would mean *which is in flower*. (Note by M. Leroux.)
