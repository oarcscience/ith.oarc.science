# Similarity of Ethnological Types

Atlantis as we shall see is said to have been inhabited by red, yellow,
white and black races. It is now proved by the researches of Le
Plongeon, De Quatrefages, Bancroft and others that black populations of
negroid type existed even up to recent times in America. Many of the
monuments of Central America are decorated with negro faces, and some of
the idols found there are clearly intended to represent negroes, with
small skulls, short woolly hair and thick lips. The Popul Vuh, speaking
of the first home of the Guatemalan race, says that "black and white men
together" lived in this happy land "in great peace," speaking "one
language."\[1\] The Popul Vuh goes on to relate how the people migrated
from their ancestral home, how their language became altered, and how
some went to the east, while others travelled west (to Central America).

\[1. See Bancroft's Native Races, p. 547.\]

Professor Retzius, in his *Smithsonian Report*, considers that the
primitive dolichocephalae of America are nearly related to the Guanches
of the Canary Islands, and to the population on the Atlantic seaboard of
Africa, which Latham comprises under the name of Egyptian Atlantidae.
The same form of skull is found In the Canary Islands off the African
coast and the Carib Islands off the American coast, while the colour of
the skin in both is that of a reddish-brown.

The ancient Egyptians depicted themselves as red men of much the same
complexion as exists to-day among some tribes of American Indians.

"The ancient Peruvians," says Short, "appear from numerous examples of
hair found in their tombs to have been an auburn-haired race."

A remarkable fact about the American Indians, and one which is a
standing puzzle to ethnologists, is the wide range of colour and
complexion to be found among them. From the white tint of the Menominee,
Dakota, Mandan, and Zuni tribes, many of whom have auburn hair and blue
eyes, to the almost negro blackness of the Karos of Kansas and the now
extinct tribes of California, the Indian races run through every shade
of red-brown, copper, olive, cinnamon, and bronze.\[1\]

We shall see by and by how the diversity of complexion

\[1. See Short's *North Americans of Antiquity*, Winchell's
*Pre-Adamites*, and Catlin's *Indians of North America*; see also
*Atlantis*, by Ignatius Donnelly, who has collected a great mass of
evidence under this and other heads.\]

on the American Continent is accounted for by the original race-tints on
the parent continent of Atlantis.
