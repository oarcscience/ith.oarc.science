# First Map Period

Before beginning the history of the race, however, a few remarks may be
made about the geography of the four different epochs.

The first map represents the land surface of the earth as it existed
about a million years ago, when the Atlantean Race was at its height,
and before the first great submergence took place about 800,000 years
ago. The continent of Atlantis itself, it will be observed, extended
from a point a few degrees east of Iceland to about the site now
occupied by Rio de Janeiro, in South America. Embracing Texas and the
Gulf of Mexico, the Southern and Eastern States of America, up to and
including Labrador, it stretched across the ocean to our own
islands--Scotland and Ireland, and a small portion of the north of
England forming one of its promontories--while its equatorial lands
embraced Brazil and the whole stretch of ocean to the African Gold
Coast. Scattered fragments of what eventually became the continents of
Europe, Africa and America, as well as remains of the still older, and
once widespread continent of Lemuria, are also shown on this map. The
remains of the still older Hyperborean continent which was inhabited by
the Second Root Race, are also given, and like Lemuria, coloured blue.
