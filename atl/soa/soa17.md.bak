# The Toltec Race

We now come to the Toltec or 3rd sub-race. This was a magnificent
development. It ruled the whole continent of Atlantis for thousands of
years in great material power and glory. Indeed so dominant and so
endowed with vitality was this race that intermarriages with the
following sub-races failed to modify the type, which still remained
essentially Toltec; and hundreds of thousands of years later we find one
of their remote family races ruling magnificently in Mexico and Peru,
long ages before their degenerate descendants were conquered by the
fiercer Aztec tribes from the north. The complexion of this race was
also a red-brown, but they were redder or more copper-coloured than the
Tlavatli. They also were a tall race, averaging about eight feet during
the period of their ascendency, but of course dwindling, as all races
did, to the dimensions that are common to-day. The type was an
improvement on the two previous sub-races, the features being straight
and well marked, not unlike the ancient Greek. The approximate
birthplace of this race may be seen, marked with the figure 3, on the
first map. It lay near the west coast of Atlantis about latitude 30º
North, and the whole of the surrounding country, embracing the bulk of
the west coast of the continent, was peopled with a pure Toltec race.
But as we shall see when dealing with the political organization, their
territory eventually extended right across the continent, and it was
from their great capital on the eastern coast that the Toltec emperors
held their almost world-wide sway.
