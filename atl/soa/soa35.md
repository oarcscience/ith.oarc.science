# Weapons

The weapons of warfare and the chase differed considerably at different
epochs. Swords and spears, bows and arrows sufficed as a rule for the
Rmoahals and the Tlavatli. The beasts which they hunted at that very
early period were mammoths with long woolly hair, elephants and
hippopotami. Marsupials also abounded as well as survivals of
intermediate types--some being half reptile and half mammal, others half
reptile and half bird.

The use of explosives was adopted at an early period, and carried to
great perfection in later times. Some appear to have been made to
explode on concussion, others after a certain interval of time, but in
either case the destruction to life seems to have resulted from the
release of some poisonous vapour, not from the impact of bullets. So
powerful indeed must have become these explosives in later Atlantean
times, that we hear of whole companies of men being destroyed in battle
by the noxious gas generated by the explosion of one of these bombs
above their heads, thrown there by some sort of lever.
