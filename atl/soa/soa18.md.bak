# The First Turanian Race

The Turanian or 4th sub-race had their origin on the eastern side of the
continent, south of the mountainous district inhabited by the Tlavatli
people. This spot is marked 4 on Map No. 1. The Turanians were colonists
from the earliest days, and great numbers migrated to the lands lying to
the east of Atlantis. They were never a thoroughly dominant race on the
mother- continent, though some of their tribes and family races became
fairly powerful. The great central regions of the continent lying west
and south of the Tlavatli mountainous district was their special though
not their exclusive home, for they shared these lands with the Toltecs.
The curious political and social experiments made by this sub-race will
be dealt with later on.
