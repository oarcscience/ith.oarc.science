# City of the Golden Gates

The "City of the Golden Gates" and its surroundings must be described
before we come to consider the remarkable system by which its
inhabitants were supplied with water. It lay, as we have seen, on the
east coast of the continent close to the sea, and about 15º north of the
equator. A beautifully wooded park-like country surrounded the city.
Scattered over a large area of this were the villa residences of the
wealthier classes. To the west lay a range of mountains, from which the
water supply of the city was drawn. The city itself was built on the
slopes of a hill, which rose from the plain about 500 feet. On the
summit of this hill lay the emperor's palace and gardens, in the centre
of which welled up from the earth a never-ending stream of water,
supplying first the palace and the fountains in the gardens, thence
flowing in the four directions and falling in cascades into a canal or
moat which encompassed the palace grounds, and thus separated them from
the city which lay below on every side. From this canal four channels
led the water through four quarters of the city to cascades which in
their turn supplied another encircling canal at a lower level. There
were three such canals forming concentric circles, the outermost and
lowest of which was still above the level of the plain. A fourth canal
at this lowest level, but on a rectangular plan, received the constantly
flowing waters, and in its turn discharged them into the sea. The city
extended over part of the plain, up to the edge of this great outermost
moat, which surrounded and defended it with a line of waterways
extending about twelve miles by ten miles square.

It will thus be seen that the city was divided into three great belts,
each hemmed in by its canals. The characteristic feature of the upper
belt that lay Just below the palace grounds, was a circular racecourse
and large public gardens. Most of the houses of the court officials also
lay on this belt, and here also was an institution of which we have no
parallel in modern times. The term "Strangers' Home" amongst us suggests
a mean appearance and sordid surroundings, but this was a palace where
all strangers who might come to the city were entertained as long as
they might choose to stay--being treated all the time as guests of the
Government. The detached houses of the inhabitants and the various
temples scattered throughout the city occupied the other two belts. In
the days of the Toltec greatness there seems to have been no real
poverty--even the retinue of slaves attached to most houses being well
fed and clothed--but there were a number of comparatively poor houses in
the lowest belt to the north, as well as outside the outermost canal
towards the sea. The inhabitants of this part were mostly connected with
the shipping, and their houses, though detached, were built closer
together than in other districts.

It will be seen from the above that the inhabitants had thus a
never-failing supply of pure clear water constantly coursing through the
city, while the upper belts and the emperor's palace were protected by
lines of moats, each one at a higher level as the centre was approached.
It was from a lake which lay among the mountains to the west of the
city, at an elevation of about 2,600 feet, that the supply was drawn.

Now it does not require much mechanical knowledge in order to realise
how stupendous must have been the works needed to provide this supply,
for in the days of its greatness the "City of the Golden Gates" embraced
within its four circles of moats over two million inhabitants. No such
system of water supply has ever been attempted in Greek, Roman or modern
times--indeed it is very doubtful whether our ablest engineers, even at
the expenditure of untold wealth, could produce such a result.
