# The Tlavatli Race

The place of origin of the Tlavatli or 2nd sub-race was an island off
the west coast of Atlantis. The spot is marked on the 1st map with the
figure 2. Thence they spread into Atlantis proper, chiefly across the
middle of the continent, gradually however tending northwards towards
the stretch of coast facing the promontory of Greenland. Physically they
were a powerful and hardy race of a red-brown colour, but they were not
quite so tall as the Rmoahals whom they drove still further north. They
were always a mountain-loving people, and their chief settlements were
in the mountainous districts of the interior, which a comparison of Maps
1 and 4 will show to be approximately coterminous with what ultimately
became the island of Poseidonis. At this first map period they also--as
just stated--peopled the northern coasts, whilst a mixture of Tlavatli
and Toltec race inhabited the western islands, which subsequently formed
part of the American continent.
