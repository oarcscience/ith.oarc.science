# Third Map Period

The third map shows the results of the catastrophe which took place
about 200,000 years ago. With the exception of the rents in the
continents both of Atlantis and America, and the submergence of Egypt,
it will be seen how relatively unimportant were the subsidences and
upheavals at this epoch, indeed the fact that this catastrophe has not
always been considered as one of the great ones, is apparent from the
quotation already given from the sacred book of the Guatemalans--three
great ones only being there mentioned. The Scandinavian island however,
appears now as joined to the mainland. The two islands into which
Atlantis was now split were known by the names of Ruta and Daitya.
