# The Original Semite Race

As regards the original Semite or 5th sub-race ethnologists have been
somewhat confused, as indeed it is extremely natural they should be
considering the very insufficient data they have to go upon. This
sub-race had its origin in the mountainous country which formed the more
southerly of the two northeastern peninsulas which, as we have seen, is
now represented by Scotland, Ireland, and some of the surrounding seas.
The site is marked 5 in Map No. 1. in this least desirable portion of
the great continent the race grew and flourished, for centuries
maintaining its independence against aggressive southern kings, till the
time came for it in turn to spread abroad and colonize. It must be
remembered that by the time the Semites rose to power hundreds of
thousands of years had passed and the 2nd map period had been reached.
They were a turbulent, discontented race, always at war with their
neighbours, especially with the then growing power of the Akkadians.
