# The Akkadian Race

The birthplace of the Akkadian or 6th sub-race will be found on Map No.
2 (marked there with the figure 6), for it was after the great
catastrophe of 800,000 years ago that this race first came into
existence. It took its rise in the land east of Atlantis, about the
middle of the great peninsula whose southeastern extremity stretched out
towards the old continent. The spot may be located approximately at
latitude 42º North and longitude 10º East. They did not for long,
however, confine themselves to the land of their birth, but overran the
now diminished continent of Atlantis. They fought with the Semites in
many battles both on land and sea, and very considerable fleets were
used on both sides. Finally about 100,000 years ago they completely
vanquished the Semites, and from that time onwards an Akkadian dynasty
was set up in the old Semite capital, and ruled the country wisely for
several hundred years. They were a great trading, sea-going and
colonizing people, and they established many centres of communication
with distant lands.
