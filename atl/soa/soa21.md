# The Mongolian Race

The Mongolian or 7th sub-race seems to be the only one that had
absolutely no touch with the mother-continent. Having its origin on the
plains of Tartary (marked No. 7 on the second map) at about latitude 63º
North and longitude 140º East, it was directly developed from
descendants of the Turanian race, which it gradually supplanted over the
greater part of Asia. This sub-race multiplied exceedingly, and even at
the present day a majority of the earth's inhabitants technically belong
to it, though many of its divisions are so deeply coloured with the
blood of earlier races as to be scarcely distinguishable from them.
