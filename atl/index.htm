Did Plato mean the tale literally or as an allegory?

This excerpt from Helena Blatavskys'
<A HREF="../the/sd/index.htm">&quot;The Secret Doctrine&quot;</A> is
supposed to be an actual book from Lemuria summarizing
occult knowledge about the evolution of the universe.
In reality it was 'channeled'.  The Theosophists greatly elaborated the
Atlantis story, adding numerous additional lost continents such as
Hyperborea, Lemuria, Daitya, Ruta, Poseidonis; and peopled them with
an entire succession of pre-human species.  (See the
