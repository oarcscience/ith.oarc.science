# PART IV.

## (Conclusions)

## CHAPTER I.

#### WAS PRE-GLACIAL MAN CIVILIZED?

WE come now to another and very interesting question:

In what stage of development was mankind when the Drift fell upon the
earth?

It is, of course, difficult to attain to certainties in the
consideration of an age so remote as this. We are, as it were, crawling
upon our hands and knees into the dark cavern of an abysmal past; we
know not whether that which we encounter is a stone or a bone; we can
only grope our way. I feel, however, that it is proper to present such
facts as I possess touching this curious question.

The conclusion at which I have arrived is, that mankind, prior to the
Drift, had, in some limited localities, reached a high stage of
civilization, and that many of our most important inventions and
discoveries were known in the pre-glacial age. Among these were pottery,
metallurgy, architecture, engraving, Carving, the use of money, the
domestication of some of our animals, and even the use of an alphabet. I
shall present the proofs of this startling conclusion, and leave the
reader to judge for himself.

{p. 342}

While this civilized, cultivated race occupied a part of the earth's
surface, the remainder of the world was peopled by races more rude,
barbarous, brutal, and animal-like than anything we know of on our earth
to-day.

In the first place, I shall refer to the legends of mankind, wherein
they depict the condition of our race in the pre-glacial time. If these
statements stood alone, we might dismiss them from consideration, for
there would be a strong probability that later ages, in repeating the
legends, would attribute to their remote ancestors the civilized
advantages which they themselves enjoyed; but it will be seen that these
statements are confirmed by the remains of man which have been dug out
of the earth, and upon which we can rely to a much greater extent.

First, as to the legends:

If I have correctly interpreted Job as a religious drama, founded on the
fall of the Drift, then we must remember that Job describes the people
overtaken by the catastrophe as a highly civilized race. They had passed
the stage of worshiping sticks and stones and idols, and had reached to
a knowledge of the one true God; they were agriculturists; they raised
flocks of sheep and camels; they built houses; they had tamed the horse;
they had progressed so far in astronomical knowledge as to have mapped
out the heavens into constellations; they wrote books, consequently they
possessed an alphabet; they engraved inscriptions upon the rocks.

But it may be said truly that the book of Job, although it may be really
a description of the Drift catastrophe, was not necessarily written at
the time of, or even immediately after, that event. So gigantic and
terrible a thing must have been the overwhelming consideration and
memory of mankind for thousands of years after it occurred. We will see
that its impress still exists on the

{p. 343}

imagination of the race. Hence we may assign to the book of Job an
extraordinary antiquity, and nevertheless it may have been written long
ages after the events to which it refers occurred; and the writer may
have clothed those events with the associations and conditions of the
age of its composition. Let us, then, go forward to the other legends,
for in such a case we can *prove* nothing. We can simply build up
cumulative probabilities.

In Ovid we read that the Earth, when the dread affliction fell upon her,
cried out:

"O sovereign of the gods, if thou approvest of this, if I have deserved
it, why do thy lightnings linger? . . . And dost thou give this as my
recompense? This as the reward of my fertility and of my duty, in that
*I endure wounds from the crooked plow and harrows*, and am harassed all
the year through? In that I supply green leaves to the *cattle*, and
*corn*, a wholesome food for mankind, and *frankincense* for yourselves?
"

Here we see that Ovid received from the ancient traditions of his race
the belief that when the Drift Age came man was already an
agriculturist; he had invented the plow and the barrow; he had
domesticated the cattle; he had discovered or developed some of the
cereals; and he possessed a religion in which incense was burned before
the god or gods. The legend of Phaëton further indicates that man had
tamed the horse and had invented wheeled vehicles.

In the Hindoo story of the coming of the demon Ravana, the comet, we
read that he carried off Sita, the wife of Rama, the sun; and that her
name indicates that she represented "the *furrowed earth*," to wit, a
condition of development in which man plowed the fields and raised crops
of food.

When we turn to the Scandinavian legends, we see

{p. 344}

that those who transmitted them from the early ages believed that
pre-glacial man was civilized. The Asas, the godlike, superior race,
dwelt, we are told, "in stone houses."

In describing, in the Elder Edda, the corrupt condition of mankind
before the great catastrophe occurred, the world, we are told, was given
over to all manner of sin and wickedness. We read:

"Brothers will fight together,  
And become each other's bane  
Sisters' children  
Their sib shall spoil.  
Hard is the world;  
Sensual sins grow huge.  
There are *axe*-ages, *sword*-ages  
*Shields* are cleft in twain,  
There are wind-ages,  
murder-ages,  
Ere the world falls dead."\[1\]

When the great day of wrath comes, Heimdal blows in the Gjallar-*horn*,
Odin *rides* to Mimer's well, Odin puts on his *golden helmet*, the Asas
hold counsel before their *stone doors*.

All these things indicate a people who had passed far beyond barbarism.
Here we have axes, swords, helmets, shields, musical instruments,
domesticated horses, the use of gold, and stone buildings. And after the
great storm was over, and the remnant of mankind crept out of the caves,
and came back to reoccupy the houses of the slain millions, we read of
the delight with which they found in the grass "the golden tablets" of
the *Asas*--additional proof that they worked in the metals, and
possessed some kind of a written language; they also had "the runes," or
runic letters of Odin.

\[1. "The Vala's Prophecy," 48, 49.\]

{p. 345}

In the Norse legends we read that Loke, the evil genius, carried off
Iduna, and her *apples*.

And when we turn to the American legends, similar statements present
themselves.

We see the people, immediately after the catastrophe, sending a
messenger to the happy eastern land, over the sea, by a bridge, to
procure drums and other musical instruments; we learn from the Aztecs
that while the darkness yet prevailed, the people built a sumptuous
*palace*, a masterpiece of skill, and on the top of it they placed an
*axe of copper*, the edge being uppermost, and on this axe the heavens
rested.\[1\]

The Navajos, shut up in their cave, had flute-players with them. The
Peruvians were dug out of their cave with a golden *spade*. In the Tahoe
legend, we read that the superior race compelled the inferior to build a
great *temple* for their protection from floods; and the oppressed
people escaped in *canoes*, while the world blazes behind them.

Soon after the Navajos came out of the cave, we find them, according to
the legend, possessed of water-jars, and we have references to the
division of the heavens into constellations.

In the Arabian legend of the City of Brass, we are told that the people
who were destroyed were great architects, metallurgists, agriculturists,
and machinists, and that they possessed a written language.

We turn now to the more reliable evidences of man's condition, which
have been exhumed from the caves and the Drift.

In the seventeenth century, Fray Pedro Simon relates that some miners,
running an adit into a hill near Callao,

\[1. Bancroft's "Native Races," vol. iii, p. 71.\]

{p. 346}

"met with a ship, *which had on top of it the great mass of the hill*,
and did not agree in its make and appearance with our ships."

Sir John Clerk describes a canoe found near Edinburgh, in 1726. "The
washings of the river Carron discovered a *boat thirteen or fourteen
feet under ground*; it is thirty-six feet long and four and a half
broad, all of one piece of oak. There were several strata above it, such
as loam, clay, shells, moss, sand, and gravel."

Boucher de Perthes found remains of man *thirty to forty feet* below the
surface of the earth.

In the following we have the evidence that the pre-glacial race was
acquainted with the use of fire, and cooked their food:

"In the construction of a canal between Stockholm and Gothenburg, it was
necessary to cut through one of those hills called *osars*, or erratic
blocks, which were deposited by the Drift ice during the glacial epoch.
Beneath an immense accumulation of osars, with shells and sand, there
was discovered *in the deepest layer of subsoil, at a depth of about
sixty feet*, a circular mass of stones, forming a hearth, in the middle
of which there were wood-coals. No other hand than that of man could
have performed the work."\[2\]

In the State of Louisiana, on Petite Anse Island, remarkable discoveries
have been made.\[3\]

At considerable depths below the surface of the earth, fifteen to twenty
feet, *immediately overlying the salt-rocks*, and *underneath* what Dr.
Foster believes to be the equivalent of the *Drift* in Europe,
"associated with the bones of elephants and other huge extinct
quadrupeds," "incredible quantities of *pottery* were found"; in some

\[1. Tylor's "Early Mankind," p. 330.

2\. Maclean's "Manual of Antiquity of Man," p. 60; Buchner, p. 242.

3\. Foster's "Prehistoric Races," p. 56, etc.\]

{p. 347}

cases these remains of pottery formed "veritable strata, three and six
inches thick"; in many cases the bones of the mastodon were found
*above* these strata of pottery. Fragments of baskets and matting were
also found.

Here we have evidence of the long-continued occupation of this spot by
man prior to the Drift Age, and that the human family had progressed far
enough to manufacture pottery, and weave baskets and matting.

The cave of Chaleux, Belgium, was buried by a mass of rubbish caused by
the falling in of the roof, consequently preserving all its implements.
There were found the split bones of mammals, and the bones of birds and
fishes. There was an immense number of objects, chiefly manufactured
from reindeer-horn, such as needles, arrow-heads, daggers, and hooks.
Besides these, there were ornaments made of shells, pieces of slate with
engraved figures, mathematical lines, remains of very coarse pottery,
hearthstones, ashes, charcoal, and last, but not least, thirty thousand
worked flints mingled with the broken bones. In the hearth, placed in
the center of the cave, was discovered a stone, with certain but
unintelligible signs engraved upon it. M. Dupont also found about twenty
pounds of the bones of the water-rat, either scorched or roasted.\[1\]

![](img/34700.jpg)

EARTHEN VASE, FOUND IN THE CAVE OF FURFOOZ, BELGIUM.

\[1. Maclean's "Antiquity of Man," p. 87.\]

{p. 348}

Here we have the evidence that the people who inhabited this cave, or
some race with whom they held intercourse, manufactured pottery; that
they wore clothing which they sewed with needles; that they used the bow
and arrow; that they caught fish with hooks; that they ornamented
themselves; that they cooked their food; that they engraved on stone;
and that they had already reached some kind of primitive alphabet, in
which signs were used to represent things.

We have already seen, (page 124, *ante*,) that there is reason to
believe that pre-glacial Europe contained a very barbarous race,
represented by the Neanderthal skull, side by side with a cultivated
race, represented by the fine lines and full brow of the Engis skull.
The latter race, I have suggested, may have come among the former as
traders, or have been captured in war; precisely as today in Central
Africa the skulls of adventurous, civilized Portuguese or Englishmen or
Americans might be found side by side with the rude skulls of the savage
populations of the country. The possession of a piece of pottery, or
carving, by an African tribe would not prove that the Africans possessed
the arts of engraving or manufacturing pottery, but it would prove that
somewhere on the earth's surface a race had advanced far enough, at that
time, to be capable of such works of art. And so, in the remains of the
pre-glacial age of Europe, we have the evidence that some of these
people, or their captives, or those with whom they traded or fought, had
gone so far in the training of civilized life as to have developed a
sense of art and a capacity to represent living forms in pictures or
carvings, with a considerable degree of taste and skill. And these works
are found in the most ancient caves, "the archaic caves," associated
with the bones of the animals

that ceased to exist in Europe at the time of the

{p. 349}

![](img/34900.jpg)

PRE-GLACIAL MAN'S PICTURE OF THE MAMMOTH

{p. 350}

Drift deposits. Nay, more, a picture of a mammoth has been found
engraved *upon a piece of mammoth-tusk*. The engraving on page 349
represents this most curious work of art.

The man who carved this must have seen the creature it represented; and,
as the mammoth did not survive the Drift, that man must have lived
before or during the Drift. And he was no savage. Says Sir John Lubbock:

"No representation, however rude, of any animal has yet been found in
any of the Danish shell-mounds, or the Stone-Age lake-villages. Even on
objects of the Bronze Age they are so rare that it is doubtful whether a
single well-authenticated instance could be produced."\[1\]

In the Dordogne caves the following spirited drawing was found,
representing a group of reindeer:

![](img/35000.jpg)

PRE-GLACIAL MAN'S PICTURE OF REINDEER.

Here it would appear as if the reindeer were fastened together by lines
or reins; if so, it implies that they were

\[1. "Prehistoric Times," p. 333.\]

{p. 351}

domesticated. In this picture they seem to have become entangled in
their lines, and some have fallen to the ground.

And it does not follow from the presence of the reindeer that the
climate was Lapland-like. The ancestors of all our so-called Arctic
animals must have lived during the mild climate of the Tertiary Age; and
those only survived after the Drift, in the north, that were capable of
accommodating themselves to the cold; the rest perished or moved
southwardly.

Another group of animals was found, engraved on a piece of the palm of a
reindeer's horn, as follows:

![](img/35100.jpg)

PRE-GLACIAL MAN'S PICTURE OF THE HORSE.

Here the man stands alongside the horse's head--a very natural position
if the horse was domesticated, a very improbable one if he was not.

Pieces of pottery have also been found accompanying these palæolithic
remains of man.

The oldest evidence of the existence of man is probably the fragment of
a cut rib from the Pliocenes of Tuscany, preserved in the museum at
Florence; it was associated with flint-flakes and *a piece of rude
pottery*.\[1\]

But the art-capacity of these people was not limited to the drawing of
animals; they also carved figures out

\[1. Dawkins's "Early Man in Britain," p. 91.\]

{p. 352}

of hard substances. The following engraving represents a poniard cut
from a reindeer's horn.

![](img/35200.jpg)

A SPECIMEN OF PRE-GLACIAL CARVING.

Sir John Lubbock says:

"The artist bas ingeniously adapted the position of the animal to the
necessities of the case. The horns are thrown back on the neck, the
fore-legs are doubled up under the belly, and the hind-legs are
stretched out along the blade."\[1\]

These things seem to indicate quite an advanced condition; the people
who made them manufactured pottery, possessed. domesticated animals, and
were able to engrave and carve images of living objects. It is difficult
to believe that they could have carved and engraved these hard
substances without metallic gravers or tools of some kind.

The reader will see, on page 130, *ante*, a representation of a sienite
plummet found *thirty feet below the surface*, in a well, in the San
Joaquin Valley, California, which Professor Foster pronounces to be--

"A finer exhibition of the lapidary's skill than has yet been furnished
by the Stone Age of either continent. "\[2\]

\[1. "Prehistoric Times," p. 335.

2\. Foster's "Prehistoric Races of the United States," p. 56.\]

{p. 353}

The following picture represents a curious image carved out of black
marble, about twice as large as the cut, found near Marlboro, Stark
County, Ohio, by some workmen, while digging a well, at a depth of
*twelve feet below the surface*. The ground above it had never been
disturbed. It was imbedded in *sand and gravel*. The black or variegated
marble out of which this image is carved has not been found in place in
Ohio.

![](img/35300.jpg)

STONE IMAGE FOUND IN OHIO

T. W. Kinney, of Portsmouth, Ohio, writes as follows:

"Last summer, while digging a vault for drainage, at the *depth of
twenty-seven feet*, the workmen found the tusk of a mastodon. The piece
was about four feet long and four inches in diameter at the thickest
part. It was nearly all lost, having, crumbled very much when exposed to
the air. I have a large piece of it; also several flakes of flint found
near the same depth.

"I also have several of the flakes from other vaults, some of which show
evidence of work.

"We also found a log at the depth of *twenty-two feet*. The log was
*burned at one end*, and at the other end was a *gap, the same as an
axeman's kerf*. Shell-banks below the level of the base of
mound-builders' works, from six to fifteen feet."\[1\]

Was this burned log, thus found at a depth of twenty-two feet, a relic
of the great conflagration? Was that

\[1. "American Antiquarian," April, 1878, p. 36.\]

{p. 354}

axe-kerf made by some civilized man who wielded a bronze or iron weapon?

It is a curious fact that *burned* logs have, in repeated instances,
been exhumed from great depths in the Drift clay.

While this work is going through the press, an article has appeared in
"Harper's Monthly Magazine," (September, 1882, p. 609,) entitled "The
Mississippi River Problem," written by David A. Curtis, in which the
author says:

"When La Salle found out how goodly a land it was, his report was the
warrant of eviction that drove out the red man to make place for the
white, as the mound-builders had made place for the Indian in what we
call the days of old. Yet it must have been only yesterday that the
mound-builders wrought in the valley, for in the few centuries that have
elapsed since then the surface of the ground has risen only a few
feet--not enough to bury their works out of sight. How long ago, then,
must it have been that the race lived there whose pavements and cisterns
of Roman brick now lie *seventy feet underground*?"

Mr. Curtis does not mean that the bricks found in this prehistoric
settlement had any historical connection with Rome, but simply that they
resemble Roman bricks. These remains, I learn, were discovered in the
vicinity of Memphis, Tennessee. The details have not yet, so far as I am
aware, been published.

Is it not more reasonable to suppose that civilized man existed on the
American Continent thirty thousand years ago, (the age fixed by
geologists for the coming of the Drift,) a comparatively short period of
time, and that his works were then covered by the Drift-*débris*, than
to believe that a race of human beings, far enough advanced in
civilization to manufacture bricks, and build pavements and cisterns,
dwelt in the Mississippi Valley, in a past so inconceivably remote that
the slow increase of the soil,

{p. 355}

by vegetable decay, has covered their works to the depth of *seventy
feet*?

I come now to the most singular and marvelous revelation of all:

Professor Alexander Winchell, in an interesting and recent work,\[1\]
says:

"I had in my possession for some time a copper relic resembling a rude
coin, which was taken from an artesian boring at the depth of *one
hundred and fourteen feet*, at Lawn Ridge, Marshall County, Illinois.

"Mr. W. H. Wilmot, then of Lawn Ridge, furnished me, in a letter dated
December 4, 1871, the following statement of deposits pierced in the
boring:

"In a letter of the 27th of December, written from Chillicothe,
Illinois, he stated that the bore was four inches for eighty feet, and
three inches for the remainder of the depth. But before one hundred feet
had been reached the four-inch portion was 'so plastered over as to be
itself but three inches in diameter,' and hence the 'coin' could not
have come from any depth less than *eighty feet*.

"'Three persons saw "the coin" at the same instant, and each claims it.'
This so-called coin was about the

\[1. "Sparks from a Geologist's Hammer," p. 170.\]

{p. 356}

thickness and size of a silver quarter of a dollar, and was of
*remarkably uniform thickness*. It was approximately round, and *seemed
to have been cut*. Its two faces bore marks as shown in the figure, *but
they were not stamped as with a die nor engraved*. They looked as if

etched

COPPER COIN, FOUND ONE HUNDRED AND FOURTEEN FEET UNDER GROUND IN
ILLINOIS.

with acid. The character of the marks was partly unintelligible. On each
side, however, was a rude outline of a human figure. One of these held
in one hand an object resembling a child, while the other was raised as
if in the act of striking. The figure wore a head-dress, apparently made
of quills. *Around the border were undecipherable hieroglyphics*. The
figure on the opposite side extended only to the waist, and had also one
hand upraised. This was furnished *with long tufts like mule's ears*.
Around the border was another circle of hieroglyphics. On this side also
was a rude outline of a quadruped. I exhibited this relic to the
Geological Section of the American Association, at its meeting at
Buffalo in 1876. The general impression seemed to be that its origin
could not date from the epoch of the stratum in which it is represented
to have been found. One person thought he could detect a rude
representation of the signs of the zodiac around the border. Another
fancied he could discover numerals, and even dates. No one could even
offer any explanation of the objects or the circumstances of its
discovery. The figures bear a close resemblance to rude drawings
executed on birch-bark and rock surfaces by the American Indians. *But
by what means were they etched*? And by what means was *the uniform
thickness of the copper produced*?

{p. 357}

This object was sent by the owner to the Smithsonian Institution for
examination, and Secretary Henry referred it to Mr. William E. Dubois,
who presented the result of his investigation to the American
Philosophical Society. *Mr. Dubois felt sure that the object had passed
through a rolling-mill, and he thought the cut edges gave further
evidence of the machine-shop*. 'All things considered,' he said, 'I can
not regard this Illinois piece as *ancient* nor *old* (observing the
usual distinction), nor yet recent; because the tooth of time is plainly
visible.' He could suggest nothing to clear up the mystery. Professor J.
P. Lesley thought it might be an astrological amulet. He detected upon
it the signs of Pisces and Leo. He read the date 1572. He said, 'The
piece was placed there as a practical joke.' He thought it might be
Hispano-American or French-American in origin. the suggestion of 'a
practical joke' is itself something which must be taken as a joke. No
person in possession of this interesting object would willingly part
with it; least of all would he throw so small an object into a hole
where not one chance in a thousand existed that it would ever be seen
again by any person.

"If this object does not date from the age of the stratum from which
obtained, it can only be a relic of the sixteenth or seventeenth
century, buried beneath the alluvium deposited more recently by the
Illinois River. The country is a level prairie, and 'Peoria Lake' is an
expansion of the river ten miles long and a mile and a half broad. It is
certainly possible that in such a region deep alluvial deposits may have
formed since the visits of the French in the latter part of the
seventeenth century. *But it is not easy to admit an accumulation of one
hundred and fourteen or one hundred and twenty-feet*, since such a depth
extends too much below the surface of the river. In Whiteside County,
fifty miles northwest from Peoria County, about 1851, according to Mr.
Moffat, *a large copper ring was found one hundred and twenty feet
beneath the surface*, as also something which has been compared to a
boat-hook. Several other objects have been found at less depths,
including *stone pipes and pottery, and a spear-shaped hatchet*, MADE OF
IRON. If these

{p. 358}

are not 'ancient,' their occurrence at depths of ten, forty, fifty, and
one hundred and twenty feet must be explained as I have suggested in
reference to the 'coin.' An instrument of iron is a strong indication of
the civilized origin of all."

This is indeed an extraordinary revelation. Here we have a copper medal,
very much like a coin, inscribed with alphabetical or hieroglyphical
signs, which, when placed under the microscope, in the hands of a
skeptical investigator, satisfies him that it is not recent, and that it
*passed through a rolling-mill and was cut by a machine*.

If it is not recent, if the tooth of time is plainly seen on it, it is
not a modern fraud; if it is not a modern fraud, then it is really the
coin of some pre-Columbian people. The Indians possessed no currency or
alphabet, so that it dates back of the red-men. Nothing similar has been
found in the hundreds of American mounds that have been opened, so that
it dates back of the mound-builders.

It comes from a depth of *not less than eighty feet in glacial clay*,
therefore it is profoundly ancient.

It is engraved after a method *utterly unknown to any civilized nation
on earth, within the range of recorded history*. IT IS ENGRAVED WITH
ACID!

It belongs, therefore, to a civilization unlike any we know of. If it
had been derived from any other human civilization, the makers, at the
same time they borrowed the round, metallic form of the coin, would have
borrowed also the mold or the stamp. But they did not; and yet they
possessed a rolling-mill and a machine to cut out the coin.

What do we infer? That there is a relationship between our civilization
and this, but it is a relationship in which this represents the parent;
and the round metallic

{p. 359}

coins of historical antiquity were derived from it, but without the art
of engraving by the use of acid.

It does not stand alone, but at great depths in the same clay
*implements of copper and of* IRON *are found*.

What does all this indicate?

That far below the present level of the State of Illinois, in the depths
of the glacial clays, about one hundred or one hundred and twenty feet
below the present surface of the land, there are found the evidences of
a high civilization. For a coin with an inscription upon it implies a
high civilization:--it implies an alphabet, a literature, a government,
commercial relations, organized society, regulated agriculture, which
could alone sustain all these; and some implement like a plow, without
which extensive agriculture is not possible; and this in turn implies
domesticated animals to draw the plow. The presence of the coin, and of
implements of copper and iron, proves that mankind had passed far beyond
the Stone Age. And these views are confirmed by the pavements and
cisterns of brick found seventy feet below the surface in the lower
Mississippi Valley.

There is a Pompeii, a Herculaneum, somewhere, underneath central and
northwestern Illinois or Tennessee, of the most marvelous character; not
of Egypt, Assyria, or the Roman Empire, things of yesterday, but
belonging to an inconceivable antiquity; to pre-glacial times; to a
period ages before the flood of Noah;--a civilization which was drowned
and deluged out of sight under the immeasurable clay-flood of the comet.

Man crawled timidly backward into the history of the past over his
little limit of six thousand years; and at the farther end of his tether
he found the perfect civilization of early Egypt. He rises to his feet
and looks still backward, and the vista of history spreads and

{p. 360}

spreads to antediluvian times. Here at last he thinks he has reached the
beginning of things: here man first domesticated the animals; here he
first worked in copper and iron; here he possessed for the first time an
alphabet, a government, commerce, and coinage. And, lo! from the bottom
of well-holes in Illinois, one hundred and fourteen feet deep, the
buckets of the artesian-well auger bring up copper rings and iron
hatchets and engraved coins--engraved by a means unknown to historical
mankind--and we stand face to face with a civilization so old that man
will not willingly dare to put it into figures.

Here we are in the presence of that great, but possibly brutal and
sensual development of man's powers, "the sword-ages, the axe-ages, the
murder-ages of the Goths," of which God cleared the earth when he buried
the mastodon under the Drift for ever.

How petty, how almost insignificant, how school-boy-like are our
historians, with their little rolls of parchment under their arms,
containing their lists of English, Roman, Egyptian, and Assyrian kings
and queens, in the presence of such stupendous facts as these!

Good reader, your mind shrinks back from such conceptions, of course.
But can you escape the facts by shrinking back? Are they not there? Are
they not all of a piece--Job, Ovid, Rama, Ragnarok, Genesis, the Aztec
legends; the engraved ivory tablets of the caves, the pottery, the
carved figures of pre-glacial Europe; the pottery-strata of Louisiana
under the Drift; the copper and iron implements, the brick pavements and
cisterns, and this coin, dragged up from well-holes in Illinois?

And what do they affirm?

That this catastrophe was indeed THE FALL OF MAN.

Think what a fall!

From comfort to misery; from plowed fields to the

{p. 361}

thistles and the stones; from sunny and glorious days in a stormless
land to the awful trials of the Drift Age; the rains, the cold, the
snow, the ice, the incessant tempests, the darkness, the poverty, the
coats of hides, the cave-life, the cannibalism, the Stone Age.

Here was a fall indeed.

There is nothing in antiquity that has not a meaning. The very fables of
the world's childhood should be sacred from our laughter.

Our theology, even where science has most ridiculed it, is based on a
great, a gigantic truth. Paradise, the summer land of fruits, the
serpent, the fire from heaven, the expulsion, the waving sword, the
"fall of man," the "darkness on the face of the deep," the age of toil
and sweat--all, all, are literal facts.

And could we but penetrate their meaning, the trees of life and
knowledge and the apples of paradise probably represent likewise great
and important facts or events in the history of our race.

And with what slow steps did mankind struggle upward! In some favored
geographical center they recovered the arts of metallurgy, the
domestication of animals, and the alphabet.

"All knowledge," says the Hindoo Krishna, "was originally bestowed on
mankind by God. They lost it. They recovered it as a recollection."

The poor barbarian Indians of America possess traditions of this ancient
civilization, traditions in forms as rude as their own condition.

It was represented by the Great Hare, Manibozho, or Nanaboshu.

Do we not find his typical picture, with those great mule-tufts,
(referred to by Professor Winchell,) the hare-like ears, on this coin of
Illinois?

{p. 362}

Read what the Indians tell of this great being

"From the remotest wilds of the Northwest," says Dr. Brinton, "to the
coast of the Atlantic, from the southern boundaries of Carolina to the
cheerless swamps of Hudson's Bay, the Algonquins were never tired of
gathering around the winter fire and repeating the story of Manibozho or
Michabo, the *Great Hare*. With entire unanimity their various branches,
the Powhatans of Virginia, the Lenni-Lenape of the Delaware, the warlike
hordes of New England, the Ottawas of the far North, and the Western
tribes, perhaps without exception, spoke of this 'chimerical beast,' as
one of the old missionaries calls it as *their common ancestor*. The
totem or clan which bore his name was looked up to with peculiar
respect. . . .

"What he really was we must seek in the accounts of older travelers, in
the invocations of the *jossakeeds* or prophets, and in the part
assigned to him in the solemn mysteries of religion. In these we find
him portrayed as the patron and founder of the Meda worship, *the
inventor of picture-writing*, the father and guardian of their nation,
the ruler of the winds, even the maker and preserver of the world and
creator of the sun and moon. From a grain of sand brought from the
bottom of the primeval ocean, he fashioned the habitable land, and set
it floating on the waters till it grew to such a size that a strong
young wolf, running constantly, died of old age ere he reached its
limits. . . . He was the founder of the medicine-hunt. . . . He himself
was a *mighty hunter* of old. . . . Attentively watching the spider
spread its web to trap unwary flies, *he devised the art of knitting
nets to catch fish*."\[1\]

This is a barbarian's recollection of a great primeval civilized race
who established religion, invented nets, and, as the other legends
concerning him show, first made the bow and arrow and worked in the
metals.

There is every reason to think the division of the people into several
classes, or families, who take the name of

\[1. "Myths of the New World," p. 175.\]

{p. 363}

some animal whose picture is their *totem*, dates back to the very
beginning of the human race. The animal fables, as I have suggested,
grew out of these animal *totems*; we find them everywhere among the
American tribes; and in some cases they are accompanied by mental and
physical traits which may be supposed to indicate that they originated
in primal race differences. This is the belief of Warren, the native
historian of the Ojibways. I am indebted to Hon. H. Al. Rice, of St.
Paul, for an opportunity to examine his valuable manuscript history of
that tribe of Indians.

The great *totem* of the Algonquins is the Hare; he represents a ruling
class, and is associated with recollections of this Great Hare, this
demi-god, this man or race, who taught them all the arts of life with
which they are acquainted. Then there is a *turtle totem*, associated
with myths of the turtle or tortoise, which are the images all over the
world of an island.\[1\]

And when we cross the Atlantic we find\[2\] that the Arabs are divided
up in the same way into tribes bearing animal names.

"*Asad*, lion; 'a number of tribes.' *Aws*, wolf; 'a tribe of the Ancar,
or Defenders.' *Badau*, ibex; 'a tribe of the Kalb and others.'
*Tha'laba*, she-fox; 'a name of tribes.' *Garad*, locusts; 'a sub-tribe
of the Azol.' *Thawr*, bull; 'a sub-tribe of Hamdan and of Abel Manah.'
*Gahah*, colt of an ass; 'a sub-tribe of the Arabs.' *Hida'*, kite; 'a
sub-tribe of Murad.'

"The origin of all names is referred, in the genealogical system of the
Arabs, to an ancestor who bore the tribal or gentile name. Thus the
*Kalb* or dog-tribe consists of the Beni-Kalb--sons of Kalb (the dog),
who is in turn son of Wabra (the female rock-badger), son of Tha'laba

\[1. Tylor's "Early History of Mankind."

{p. 364}

(the she-fox), great-grandson of Quoda'a, grandson of Saba', the Sheba
of Scripture. A single member of the tribe is Kalbi--a
Kalbite--*Caninus*."

"The same names which appear as *totem* tribes reach through Edom,
Midian, and Moab, into the land of Canaan."\[1\]

Among the Jews there was the stock of the serpent, Nashon, to which
David belonged; and there is no doubt that they were once divided into
totemic families.

And in all this we see another proof of the race-identity of the peoples
on the opposite sides of the Atlantic.

Permit me to close this chapter with a suggestion:

Is there not energy enough among the archæologists of the United States
to make a thorough examination of some part of the deep clay deposits of
Central Illinois or of those wonderful remains referred to by Mr.
Curtis?

If one came and proved that at a given point he had found indications of
a coal-bed or a gold-mine, he would have no difficulty in obtaining
means enough to dig a shaft and excavate acres. Can not the greed for
information do one tenth as much as the greed for profit?

Who can tell what extraordinary revelations wait below the vast mass of
American glacial clay? For it must be remembered that the articles
already found have been discovered in the narrow holes bored or dug for
wells. How small is the area laid bare by such punctures in the earth
compared with the whole area of the country in which they are sunk! How
remarkable that *anything* should have been found under such
circumstances! How probable, therefore, that the remains of man are
numerous at a certain depth!

Where a coin is found we might reasonably expect to

\[1. W. J. F. Maclennan, "Fortnightly Review," 1869 and 1870.\]

{p. 365}

find other works of copper, and all those things which would accompany
the civilization of a people working in the metals and using a
currency,--such as cities, houses, temples, etc. Of course, such things
might exist, and yet many shafts might be sunk without coming upon any
of them. But is not the attempt worth making?
