### CHAPTER IV.

##### RAGNAROK

THERE is in the legends of the Scandinavians a marvelous record of the
coming of the Comet. It has been repeated generation after generation,
translated into all languages, commented on, criticised, but never
understood. It has been regarded as a wild, unmeaning rhapsody of words,
or as a premonition of some future earth catastrophe.

But look at it!

The very name is significant. According to Professor Anderson's
etymology of the word, it means "the darkness of the gods"; from
*regin*, gods, and *rökr*, darkness; but it may, more properly, be
derived from the Icelandic, Danish, and Swedish *regn*, a rain, and
*rök*, smoke, or dust; and it may mean the rain of dust, for the clay
came first as dust; it is described in some Indian legends as ashes.

First, there is, as in the tradition of the Druids, page 135, *ante*,
the story of an age of crime.

The Vala looks upon the world, and, as the "Elder Edda" tells us--

There saw she wade  
In the heavy streams,  
Men--foul murderers  
And perjurers,  
And them who others' wives  
Seduce to sin.  
Brothers slay brothers  
Sisters' children  
Shed each other's blood. {p. 142}  
Hard is the world!  
Sensual sin grows huge.  
There are sword-ages, axe-ages;  
Shields are cleft in twain;  
Storm-ages, murder ages;  
Till the world falls dead,  
And men no longer spare  
Or pity one another."\[1\]

The world has ripened for destruction; and "Ragnarok," the darkness of
the gods, or the rain of dust and ashes, comes to complete the work.

The whole story is told with the utmost detail, and we shall see that it
agrees, in almost every particular, with what reason assures us must
have happened.

"There are three winters," or years, "during which great wars rage over
the world." Mankind has reached a climax of wickedness. Doubtless it is,
as now, highly civilized in some regions, while still barbarian in
others.

"Then happens that which will seem a great miracle: that *the wolf
devours the sun*, and this will seem a great loss."

That is, the Comet strikes the sun, or approaches so close to it that it
seems to do so.

"The other wolf devours the moon, and this, too, will cause great
mischief."

We have seen that the comets often come in couples or triplets.

"The stars shall be hurled from heaven."

This refers to the blazing *débris* of the Comet falling to the earth.

"Then it shall come to pass that the earth will shake so violently that
trees will be torn up by the roots, the

\[1. Anderson, "Norse Mythology," p. 416.\]

{p. 143}

mountains will topple down, and all bonds and fetters will be broken and
snapped."

Chaos has come again. How closely does all this agree with Hesiod's
description of the shaking earth and the universal conflict of nature?

"The Fenris-wolf gets loose."

This, we shall see, is the name of one of the comets.

"*The sea rushes over the earth*, for the Midgard-serpent writhes in
giant rage, and seeks to gain the land."

The Midgard-serpent is the name of another comet; it strives to reach
the earth; its proximity disturbs the oceans. And then follows an
inexplicable piece of mythology:

"The ship that is called Naglfar also becomes loose. It is made of the
nails of dead men; wherefore it is worth warning that, when a man dies
with unpared nails, he supplies a large amount of materials for the
building of this ship, which both gods and men wish may be finished as
late as possible. But in this flood Naglfar gets afloat. The giant Hrym
is its steersman.

"The Fenris-wolf advances with wide-open mouth; *the upper jaw reaches
to heaven and the lower jaw is on the earth*."

That is to say, the comet extends from the earth to the sun.

"He would open it still wider had he room."

That is to say, the space between the sun and earth is not great enough;
the tail of the comet reaches even beyond the earth.

"*Fire flashes from his eyes and nostrils*."

A recent writer says:

"When bright comets happen to come very near to the sun, and are
subjected to close observation under the

{p. 144}

advantages which the fine telescopes of the present day afford, a series
of remarkable changes is found to take place in their luminous
configuration. First, *jets of bright light start out from the nucleus*,
and move through the fainter haze of the coma toward the sun; and then
these jets are turned backward round the edge of the coma, and stream
from it, behind the comet, until they are fashioned into a tail."\[1\]

"The Midgard-serpent vomits forth *venom*, defiling all the air and the
sea; he is very terrible, and places himself *side by side with the
wolf*."

The two comets move together, like Biela's two fragments; and they give
out poison--the carbureted-hydrogen gas revealed by the spectroscope.

"In the midst of this clash and din the heavens are rent in twain, and
the sons of Muspelheim come riding through the opening."

Muspelheim, according to Professor Anderson,\[2\] means the day of
judgment." *Muspel* signifies an abode of fire, peopled by fiends. So
that this passage means, that the heavens are split open, or appear to
be, by the great shining comet, or comets, striking the earth; it is a
world of fire; it is the Day of Judgment.

"Surt rides first, and before him and after *him flames burning fire*."

Surt is a demon associated with the comet;\[3\] he is the same as the
destructive god of the Egyptian mythology, Set, who destroys the sun. It
may mean the blazing nucleus of the comet.

"He has a very good sword that shines brighter than the sun. As they
ride over Bifrost it breaks to pieces, as has before been stated."

\[1. "Edinburgh Review," October, 1874, p. 207.

2\. "Norse Mythology," p. 454.

3\. Ibid., p. 458.\]

{p. 145}

Bifrost, we shall have reason to see hereafter, was a prolongation of
land westward from Europe, which connected the British Islands with the
island-home of the gods, or the godlike race of men.

There are geological proofs that such a land once existed. A writer,
Thomas Butler Gunn, in a recent number of an English publication,\[1\]
says:

"Tennyson's 'Voyage of Maeldune' is a magnificent allegorical expansion
of this idea; and the laureate has also finely commemorated the old
belief in the country of Lyonnesse, *extending beyond the bounds* of
Cornwall:

'A land of old upheaven from the abyss  
By fire, *to sink into the abyss again*;  
Where fragments of forgotten peoples dwelt,  
And the long mountains ended in a coast  
Of ever-shifting sands, and far away  
The phantom circle of a moaning sea.'

"Cornishmen of the last generation used to tell stories of strange
household relics picked up at the very low tides, nay, even of the
quaint habitations seen fathoms deep in the water."

There are those who believe that these Scandinavian Eddas came, in the
first instance, from Druidical Briton sources.

The Edda may be interpreted to mean that the Comet strikes the planet
west of Europe, and crushes down some land in that quarter, called "the
bridge of Bifrost."

Then follows a mighty battle between the gods and the Comet. It can
have, of course, but one termination; but it will recur again and again
in the legends of different nations. It was necessary that the gods, the
protectors of mankind, should struggle to defend them against these
strange and terrible enemies. But their very helplessness

\[1. "All the Year Round."\]

{p. 146}

and their deaths show how immense was the calamity which had befallen
the world.

The Edda continues:

"The sons of Muspel direct their course to the plain which is called
Vigrid. Thither repair also the Fenris-wolf and the Midgard-serpent."

Both the comets have fallen on the earth.

"To this place have also come Loke" (the evil genius of the Norse
mythology) "and Hrym, and with him all the Frost giants. In Loke's
company are all the friends of Hel" (the goddess of death). "The sons of
Muspel have then their efficient bands alone by themselves. The plain
Vigrid is one hundred miles (rasts) on each side."

That is to say, all these evil forces, the comets, the fire, the devil,
and death, have taken possession of the great plain, the heart of the
civilized land. The scene is located in this spot, because probably it
was from this spot the legends were afterward dispersed to all the
world.

It is necessary for the defenders of mankind to rouse themselves. There
is no time to be lost, and, accordingly, we learn--

"While these things are happening, Heimdal" (he was the guardian of the
Bifrost-bridge) "stands up, blows with all his might in the Gjallar-horn
and *awakens all the gods*, who thereupon hold counsel. Odin rides to
Mimer's well to ask advice of Mimer for himself and his folk.

"Then quivers the ash Ygdrasil, and all things in heaven and earth
tremble."

The ash Ygdrasil is the tree-of-life; the tree of the ancient
tree-worship; the tree which stands on the top of the pyramid in the
island-birth place of the Aztec race; the tree referred to in the Hindoo
legends.

"The asas" (the godlike men) "and the einherjes" (the heroes) "arm
themselves and speed forth to the battlefield. Odin rides first; with
his golden helmet, resplendent

{p. 147}

byrnie, and his spear Gungner, he advances against the Fenris-wolf" (the
first comet). "Thor stands by his side, but can give him no assistance,
for he has his hands full in his struggle with the Midgard-serpent" (the
second comet). "Frey encounters Surt, and heavy blows are exchanged ere
Frey falls. The cause of his death is that he has not that good sword
which he gave to Skirner. Even the dog Garm," (another comet), "that was
bound before the Gnipa-cave, gets loose. He is the greatest plague. He
contends with Tyr, and they kill each other. Thor gets great renown by
slaying the Midgard-serpent, but retreats only nine paces when he falls
to the earth dead, *poisoned by the venom that the serpent blows upon
him*."

He has breathed the carbureted-hydrogen gas!

"The wolf swallows Odin, and thus causes his death; but Vidar
immediately turns and rushes at the wolf, placing one foot on his nether
jaw.

\["On this foot he has the shoe, for which materials have been gathering
through all ages, namely, the strips of leather which men cut off from
the toes and heels of shoes; wherefore he who wishes to render
assistance to the asas must cast these strips away."\]

This last paragraph, like that concerning the ship Naglfar, is probably
the interpolation of some later age. The narrative continues:

"With one hand Vidar seizes the upper jaw of the wolf, and thus rends
asunder his mouth. Thus the wolf perishes. Loke fights with Heimdal, and
they kill each other. *Thereupon Surt flings fire over the earth, and
burns up all the world*."

This narrative is from the Younger Edda. The Elder Edda is to the same
purpose, but there are more allusions to the effect of the catastrophe
on the earth

The eagle screams,  
*And with pale beak tears corpses*. . . .  
Mountains dash together, {p. 148}  
Heroes go the way to Hel,  
And heaven is rent in twain. . . .  
*All men abandon their homesteads*  
When the warder of Midgard  
In wrath slays the serpent.  
*The sun grows dark,  
The earth sinks into the sea*,  
The bright stars  
From heaven vanish;  
*Fire rages,  
Heat blazes,  
And high flames play  
'Gainst heaven itself*"

And what follow then? Ice and cold and winter. For although these things
come first in the narrative of the Edda, yet we are told that "*before
these*" things, to wit, the cold winters, there occurred the wickedness
of the world, and the wolves and the serpent made their appearance. So
that the events transpired in the order in which I have given them.

"First there is a winter called the Fimbul winter,"

"The mighty, the great, the iron winter,"\[1\]

"'*When snow drives from. all quarters*, the frosts are so severe, the
winds so keen, there is no joy in the sun. *There are three such winters
in succession, without any intervening summer*."

Here we have the Glacial period which followed the Drift. Three years of
incessant wind, and snow, and intense cold.

The Elder Edda says, speaking of the Fenris-wolf:

"It feeds on the bodies  
Of men, when they die  
The seats of the gods  
*It stains with red blood*."

\[1. "Norse Mythology," p. 444.\]

{p. 149}

This probably refers to the iron-stained red clay cast down by the Comet
over a large part of the earth; the "seats of the gods" means the home
of the god-like race, which was doubtless covered, like Europe and
America, with red clay; the waters which ran from it must have been the
color of blood.

"*The Sunshine blackens*  
In the summers thereafter,  
And the weather grows bad."

In the Younger Edda (p. 57) we are given a still more precise
description of the Ice age:

"Replied Har, explaining, that as soon as the streams, that are called
Elivogs" (the rivers from under ice), "had came so far that the venomous
yeast" (the clay?) "which flowed with them hardened, as does dross that
runs from the fire, then it turned" (as) "into ice. And when this ice
stopped and flowed no more, then gathered over it the drizzling rain
that arose from the venom" (the clay), "and froze into rime" (ice),
"*and one layer of ice was laid upon another clear into the
Ginungagap*."

Ginungagap, we are told,\[1\] was the name applied in the eleventh
century by the Northmen to the ocean between Greenland and Vinland, or
America. It doubtless meant originally the whole of the Atlantic Ocean.
The clay, when it first fell, was probably full of chemical elements,
which rendered it, and the waters which filtered through it, unfit for
human use; clay waters are, to this day, the worst in the world.

"Then said Jafnhar: 'All that part of Ginungagap that turns to the
north' (the north Atlantic) 'was filled with thick and heavy ice and
rime, and everywhere within were drizzling rains and gusts. But the
south part of Ginungagap was lighted up by the glowing sparks that flew
out of Muspelheim.'"

\[1. "Norse Mythology," p. 447.\]

{p. 150}

The ice and rime to the north represent the age of ice and snow.
Muspelheim was the torrid country of the south, over which the clouds
could not yet form in consequence of the heat--Africa.

But it can not last forever. The clouds disappear; the floods find their
way back to the ocean; nature begins to decorate once more the scarred
and crushed face of the world. But where is the human race? The "Younger
Edda" tells us:

"During the conflagration caused by Surt's fire, a woman by the name of
Lif and a man named Lifthraser lie concealed in Hodmimer's hold, or
forest. The dew of the dawn serves them for food, and so great a race
shall spring from them, that their descendants shall soon spread over
the whole earth."\[1\]

The "Elder Edda" says:

"Lif and Lifthraser  
Will lie hid  
In Hodmimer's-holt;  
The morning dew  
They have for food.  
From them are the races descended."

Holt is a grove, or forest, or hold; it was probably a cave. We shall
see that nearly all the legends refer to the caves in which mankind
escaped from destruction.

This statement,

"From them are the races descended,"

shows that this is not prophecy, but history; it refers to the past, not
to the future; it describes not a Day of Judgment to come, but one that
has already fallen on the human family.

Two others, of the godlike race, also escaped in some

\[1. "Norse Mythology" p. 429.\]

{p. 151}

way not indicated; Vidar and Vale are their names. They, too, had
probably taken refuge in some cavern.

"Neither the sea nor Surt's fire had harmed them, and they dwell on the
plains of Ida, where Asgard *was before*. Thither come also the sons of
Thor, Mode, and Magne, and they have Mjolner. *Then come Balder and
Hoder from Hel*.

Mode and Magne are children of Thor; they belong to the godlike race.
They, too, have escaped. Mjolner is Thor's hammer. Balder is the Sun; he
has returned from the abode of death, to which the comet consigned him.
Hoder is the Night.

All this means that the fragments and remnants of humanity reassemble on
the plain of Ida--the plain of Vigrid--where the battle was fought. They
possess the works of the old civilization, represented by Thor's hammer;
and the day and night once more return after the long midnight
blackness.

And the Vala looks again upon a renewed and rejuvenated world:

"She sees arise  
The second time.  
From the sea, the earth,  
*Completely green*.  
The cascades fall,  
The eagle soars,  
From lofty mounts  
Pursues its prey."

It is once more the glorious, the sun-lighted world the world of
flashing seas, dancing streams, and green leaves; with the eagle, high
above it all,

"Batting the sunny ceiling of the globe  
With his dark wings;"

while

"The wild cataracts leap in glory."

{p. 152}

What history, what poetry, what beauty, what inestimable pictures of an
infinite past have lain hidden away in these Sagas--the despised
heritage of all the blue-eyed, light-haired races of the world!

Rome and Greece can not parallel this marvelous story:

The gods convene  
On Ida's plains,  
And talk of the powerful  
Midgard-serpent;  
They call to mind  
The Fenris-wolf  
And the ancient runes  
Of the mighty Odin."

What else can mankind think of, or dream of, or talk of for the next
thousand years but this awful, this unparalleled calamity through which
the race has passed?

A long-subsequent but most ancient and cultivated people, whose memory
has, for us, almost faded from the earth, will thereafter embalm the
great drama in legends, myths, prayers, poems, and sagas; fragments of
which are found to-day dispersed through all literatures in all lands;
some of them, as we shall see, having found their way even into the very
Bible revered alike of Jew and Christian:

The Edda continues,

"Then again  
The wonderful Golden tablets  
Are found in the grass  
In time's morning,  
The leader of the gods  
And Odin's race  
Possessed them."

And what a find was that! This poor remnant of humanity discovers "the
golden tablets" of the former

{p. 153}

civilization. Doubtless, the inscribed tablets, by which the art of
writing survived to the race; for what would tablets be without
inscriptions? For they talk of "the ancient runes of mighty Odin," that
is, of the runic letters, the alphabetical writing. And we shall see
hereafter that this view is confirmed from other sources.

There follows a happy age:

"The fields unsown  
Yield their growth;  
All ills cease.  
Balder comes.  
Hoder and Balder,  
Those heavenly gods,  
Dwell together in Odin's halls."

The great catastrophe is past. Man is saved, The world is once more
fair. The sun shines again in heaven. Night and day follow each other in
endless revolution around the happy globe. Ragnarok is past.
