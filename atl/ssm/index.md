This is the third book in James Churchward's *Mu* series, one of several
which slipped into the public domain in the US because some paperwork
wasn't submitted on time to the copyright office. This one seemed to be
the most on-topic for this site.

According to Churchward, Mu was a lost continent in the Pacific Ocean,
which was destroyed in a global cataclysm tens of thousands of years
ago; Mu was the original home of mankind, and all subsequent
civilizations descended from it. The Pacific islands and their
inhabitants are supposed to be the last survivors of this primordial
motherland. Churchward's Mu was a huge continent, which stretched from
Micronesia in the West to Easter Island and Hawaii in the East.
Churchward also believed in a literal mid-Atlantic Atlantis. He proposed
a global network of huge gas-filled caverns which, if vented, could
cause large areas of land to be submerged.

Churchward served with the British Army for thirty years. He claimed
that, while posted in India, he befriended a priest ('Rishi'), who
revealed to him ancient tablets written in an otherwise unknown
language. The Rishi taught Churchward how to read this language, Naacal.
The tablets described the land of Mu, the Lemuria of the Theosophists.
He also claimed that he was able to discern writing from Mu on a
mysterious set of tablets discovered in Mexico by an explorer named
William Niven.

Churchward's Mu theory hasn't achieved even the marginal credibility of
Atlantis. For one thing, his science is absurd. The Pacific appears to
have been free of large land masses for billions of years. In fact, the
Pacific basin may mark the place where the Moon was expelled from the
proto-earth. Coral atolls that dot the Pacific have taken millions of
undisturbed years of activity to form. And the Pacific was one of the
last regions on the planet to be settled by humans; this is proven by
linguistic evidence, and the well-documented oral traditions which
describe the history of the Polynesian migrations.

It doesn't help matters that Churchward's books are largely absent of
apparatus such as footnotes or bibliography, and his basic source
material cannot be independently confirmed. In his Mu-monomania, he
employs circular and tautological reasoning. Often, he will make a
startling assertion, and before supporting it, will move on to some
other train of thought. At other times, he writes factually about, say,
Egyptian mythology, without any clue for the reader as to why this
proves anything about Mu. The reader is simultaneously entertained and
irritated by this intellectual shell game.

However, Churchward may have the last laugh yet. There *was* a large
land mass in the Pacific that was submerged during prehistoric times:
Sundaland, the continental shelf around Indonesia, which was exposed
during the ice ages. It was most certainly the route that humans used to
get to Australia, as only a few kilometers of water separated Sundaland
from Australia at that time. Although it was submerged slowly as the
result of rising sea levels at the end of the ice age, the region has
some of the most violent volcanoes on Earth (such as the famous
Krakatoa). A documented eruption in that region about 60,000 years ago
may have decimated the human race, producing a 'population bottleneck'
during which our species was reduced to a few hundred individuals; this
has emerged from mitochondrial DNA studies. Some have hypothesized that
Sundaland may have been home to an early lost civilization, perhaps the
home of the mysterious voyagers who charted the [anomalous ice-age
maps](../../piri/index.md) which the early modern map-makers incorporated
in their atlases. While not Mu or Lemuria, of all of the nooks and
crannies where a lost civilization might have existed, Sundaland is one
of the most plausible; only time will tell.
