<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">SYMBOLS RELATING TO MU</H1>
<P>THE SACRED LOTUS.--The Lotus has always been looked upon as the most sacred of all sacred flowers--why?</P>
<P>Because it was selected as Mu's floral symbol. Why was it so selected? The Lotus was the <I>first</I> flower to beautify the earth. Being the <I>first</I> flower and Mu the land where man first appeared on earth, Mu and the Lotus were naturally symbolic synonyms. As a mark of love and mourning, the Egyptians, after the destruction of Mu, never depicted the lotus as an open, living flower but always as closed and dead.</P>
<P>The lotus is a prominent figure in the carvings and adornments of all ancient temples, and, except in Egypt, was continued down as open and conventional until King Solomon's Temple. In this form, the tips of the petals are turned in.</P>
<P>The lotus was indigenous to Mu. The plant was carried to all parts of the world by the colonists, so that wherever we find the lotus today, we know that the parent stock, like the parent stock of man, came originally from Mu.</P>

<I><P>Fig. 3</I>. The second of the four glyphs for M in Mu's alphabet. This was the symbol for Mu as the <I>Mother</I> of man.</P>
<I><P>Fig. 4</I>. This is the numeral 3. Three was the numeral symbol for Mu and very much used.</P>
<I><P>Fig. 5</I>. The two lotus buds are the symbols for the two islands adjacent to Mu. Mu and these two islands were geologically known as the Lands of the West.</P>
<I><P>Fig. 6</I>. An open lotus very much used in decorations and in traceries on temple walls, when it was desired to refer to Mu. The ends of the petals are turned in to denote Death.</P>
<I><P>Fig. 7</I>. This is a symbol constantly appearing in the Maya writings and has been translated in every conceivable way except the correct one. Some of these decipherings are absolutely ludicrous, Le Plongeon's as an example. This glyph is a compound symbol being composed of the second M in Mu's alphabet <A NAME="img_16700"></A>

<IMG SRC="img/16801.jpg"> These imix' say, the breast of Mu. In many of the ancient writings the two islands are called the breasts of Mu. Therefore a liberal translation would be "Mu, the Mother of Man," and because the two islands are included, the Lands of the West. The imix is drawn as follows in the Troano MS.:</P>

<I><P>Altar Painting--The Legend, Deciphering and Translation</I>: This temple is dedicated to the Sacred Four--the Four Great Forces which issue from the mouth of The Almighty and are His commands. They first of all evolved law and order out of chaos throughout the Universe, and then created all things. They have now the charge of the physical welfare of all creations. They order and control the movements of the Universe today. This temple is under the jurisdiction of the mother church of Mu, whose High Priest is Ra Mu, who is the mouthpiece of the Almighty One.</P>
<P>This legend is a key to the extreme age of the Mexican tablets. The legend shows that at the time the temple was built Mu was above water, because the temple is under the jurisdiction of Mu. Mu was submerged about 10,000 B. C., thus showing that this temple was built <I>more</I> than <I>12,000 years ago</I>, but how much longer I have found nothing to indicate.</P>

<P>"Mu, the Empire of the Sun, the Lands of the West, has fallen into an abyss. She is in the region of darkness, where the Sun never shines upon her. Her crown no longer rules the earth."</P>
<P>While there are scores) hundreds even, of writings that tell of the destruction of Mu, I have found only two tableaux depicting her destruction. First I found the Egyptian, and next this North American Indian. <I>Legend</I>: "The Creator considered the destruction of the Motherland of Man. So the Four Great Forces the executors of His commands caused the waters to swallow her up. They caused her to be carried down into a watery abyss and be submerged.</P>
<I><P>Three Vignettes from the Egyptian</I> "'Book of the Dead" depicting the destruction of Mu by falling into a "tank" of fire--a fiery pit. As she went down, flames arose around and enveloped her.</P>

<I><P>A Mexican Stone Tablet</I>: This is one of the most extraordinary tablets I have ever examined. It is a stone with highly glazed colors. The glyphs are like glass and have been cut out of the face of the stone--a fine sandstone--for a depth of about 1/16<SUP>th</SUP> of an inch. The writings are in ancient, very ancient, characters used by the priesthood only. Of what age it is, I have no idea: but the one who arranged the glyphs had a temple knowledge.

<P>Nagas only. It cannot be over 12,000 years old, because the writing is a description of the destruction of Mu. It was bought from an Indian in Mexico City who said he found it in a ruin. We must take the statement for what it is worth.</P>
<I><P>Legend</I>: "Kuiland, The Great Ruler of the Earth, exists no longer. She was shaken up and down by earthquakes in various places. The land rolled like ocean swells. Finally, the Pillars that supported her gave way. She then sank into a fiery abyss. As the Great Ruler went down, flames from the fires of the underneath arose and enveloped her. The waters rolled in over her sunken form. Then was Kuiland, The Great Ruler, submerged."</P>
<I><P>The Field of Aarru, Chapter 110, "Book of the Dead."</I> This large vignette, one of the largest in <A HREF="errata.htm#4">the</A> Book of the Dead, was not comprehended by Ezra or any of his associates. Neither has it been comprehended by any Egyptologist of the present time. To substantiate my contention I have shown the two ends of this symbolic picture.</P>
<P>The Vignette depicts the life of man in the Motherland. The lower part is a conventional map of Mu. On the left hand top corner of the upper part, there are three cartouches bearing the names of three waters, shown in the lower part. The lower part also shows three lands, each surrounded by water. The names of these waters as read by Egyptologists are: Power of waters. Innumerable waters. Great place of waters.</P>

<P>Now let us see what Ezra's translations of them are: Genesis, Chapter 2, Verse 11. "The name of the first is Pison. The name of the second Gihon. And the third Hiddekel." Next I shall take the Biblical boundaries of the Garden of Eden. They are given thus:--</P>
<I><P>Verse 8</I> And the Lord God planted a garden eastward in Eden and there he put the man whom he had formed.</P>

<P>(Anyone looking at the map today taking in Ethiopia, Assyria and the Valley of the Euphrates--and seeing how a land might possibly cover this area--to represent either an island or a garden, must at once feel that the Biblical description is purely symbolical, which is corroborated in Verse 8, where it says the garden was <I>eastward</I> in Eden. Where this was written was either in Egypt or Palestine-therefore, according to present general acceptance, in the middle of the garden itself, being in the east or towards the east is a link showing the Garden of Eden that was Mu in another vestment.)</P>
<I><P>Verse 9</I> And out of the ground made the Lord God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good</P>
<P><A NAME="page_179"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 179</FONT></A></P>
<P>for food: the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil.</P>
<I><P>Verse 10</I> And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from thence it was parted, and became into four heads.</P>
<I><P>Verse 11</I> The name of the first is Pison, that is it which compassed the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold.</P>
<I><P>Verse 12</I> And the gold of that land is good, there is bedellium and the onyx stone.</P>
<I><P>Verse 13</I> And the name of the second river is Gihon the same it is that compasseth the whole land of Ethiopia.</P>
<I><P>Verse 14</I> And the name of the third river is Hiddekel: that is it which goeth towards the east of Assyria, and the fourth river is Euphrates.</P>
<I><P>The Four Genii</I>, as I have previously stated, were, to my mind another vestment of the Sacred Four; which, in turn were given the name of the Four Great Pillars, the executors of the Creator's commands.</P>
<P>The Genii appeared to be very popular among all ancient peoples since the demise of Mu for I do not find their names before that date. But in all nations and peoples during the past 10,000 or 11,000 years the Genii are quite prominent. Most of the ancient peoples seem to have had a varied conception of them, and how they should be described. I find them associated with all histories and traditions of the creation. One of the oldest records that I have found of them comes from the <FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT> </P>
<P><A NAME="page_180"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 180</FONT></A></P>
<P>Mayas of Yucatan and Central America. With them the Genii were referred to as "the Keepers of the Pillars."</P>
<P>The Mayas as well as all other ancients symbolized the earth as a four-sided square. At times and for certain purposes, for explanation, they stood the square on one of its points forming a diamond out of it. This brought the four points into astronomical lines pointing north, south, east and west, making Four Cardinal Points. The theology said--that at these four points, were four pillars sustaining heaven, and at the foot of each pillar, was stationed one of the Genii, to look after and care for it. The names of the Maya genii were:--</P>
<I><P>Kan-Bacab</I>--the Yellow Bacab, placed in the South.</P>
<I><P>Chac-Bacab</I>--the Red Bacab, placed in the East.</P>
<I><P>Zac-Bacab</I>--the White Bacab, placed in the North.</P>
<I><P>Ec-Bacab</I>--the Black Bacab, placed in the West.</P>
<P>It is thus seen that the Mayas, chose to define their genii by colors.</P>
<I><P>The Hindus</I> had four Genii presiding at their Four Cardinal Points. (The Hindus used the words cardinal points symbolically. They did not refer to any particular spot or spots, but to wherever they might be.)</P>
<P>Instead of colors their Genii were called by phenomena connected with life, their names were:--</P>
<I><P>Rouvera</I>--the God of Wealth, placed in the North.</P>
<I><P>Yama</I>--the judge of the Dead, placed in the South.</P>
<I><P>Indra</I>--the King of Heaven, placed in the East.</P>
<I><P>Varona</I>--the God of the Waters, placed in the West.</P>
<P>The Genii were also called gods by the Hindus.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_181"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 181</FONT></A></P>
<I><P>Chinese</I>. The Chinese designated their Genii as Yo's--mountains. The four mountains Tse-Yo. They also referred to them as the four quarters of the earth. They are</P>
<I><P>Tai-Tsong</I>--the Yo of the East.</P>
<I><P>Saing-Fou</I>--the Yo of the West.</P>
<I><P>How-Kowang</I>--the Yo of the South.</P>
<I><P>Chin-Si</I>--the Yo of the North.</P>
<P><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT> The Chinese symbolized these mountains as a mountain in the shape of a triangle with an eye at the apex of the mountain looking down from it.</P>
<I><P>Egyptian</I>. According to the Egyptian theology there were Four Genii in Amenti, which were placed at the Four Cardinal Points in charge of the pillar which stood there, their names were:--</P>
<I><P>Amset</I>--the genius at the Cardinal Point in the East.</P>
<I><P>Hapu</I>--the genius at the Cardinal Point in the West.</P>
<I><P>Tesautmutf</I>--the genius at the Cardinal Point in the North.</P>
<I><P>Quabsenuf</I>--the genius at the Cardinal Point in the South.</P>
<P>Chap. 125, Book of the Dead, has a large picture of the great Hall of Truth of Osiris. Near the seat of Osiris in this picture are shown the Four Genii. They are symbolized as men in mummy form. One has the head of a human being, another the head of a monkey, a third the head of a hawk, and the fourth the head of a jackal (Anubis).</P>
<I><P>Chaldean</I>. The Chaldeans believed that there were <FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT> </P>
<P><A NAME="page_182"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 182</FONT></A></P>
<P>Four Genii protecting and looking after the welfare of all human beings. This example does much to show the origin of the genii. As by the swastika, we frequently see in the ancient writings that man's welfare is constantly being watched over by the Sacred Four, symbolized by crosses et cetera, and that by watching over and caring for the physical welfare of the universe, including man, they are acting as the executors of the Creator's wishes, desires, commandments et cetera. This is the exact work of the genii as conceived by the Chaldeans. The names given to the genii by the Chaldeans are:--</P>
<I><P>Sed-Alap</I> or <I>Kirub</I>--Represented as a bull with a human face.</P>
<I><P>Lamas</I> or <I>Nigal</I>--Represented as a lion with a man's head.</P>
<I><P>Ustar</I>--After the human likeness.</P>
<I><P>Nattig</I>--Represented with the head of an eagle.</P>
<I><P>The Hittites</I>, <I>Assyrians</I> and <I>Persians</I> all had the Genii engrafted in their cosmogony.</P>
<I><P>The Israelites</I>. Although I cannot find any direct reference in the Jewish research which I have made, that is no criterion and does not say that they entirely rejected the idea.</P>
<P>In Ezekiel, Chapter 1, Verse 10, there is something at least touching on it, for it says: "They four had the face of a man, and the face of a lion, on the right side: and they four had the face of an ox on the left side; they four also had the face of an eagle." The foregoing is</P>
<P><A NAME="page_183"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 183</FONT></A></P>
<P>given as a vision of Ezekiel. At the time this was written Ezekiel was a captive among the Chaldeans.</P>
<P>Let us compare this vision with the Chaldean creed which had been in existence thousands of years before Ezekiel came on earth.</P>
<I><P>Ezekiel's dream</I>. Four beasts with the heads of a man, another an ox, another a lion, and the fourth, an eagle.</P>
<I><P>Chaldean Belief</I>. Four Genii, beasts with heads; one with a human face, one with a face of a bull one with the face of a lion and the fourth with the face of an eagle. These Chaldean genii stood at the bottom of steps leading to temples and palaces, one could not walk through a city without seeing many of them.</P>
<P>Thus to me it seems unquestionable that Ezekiel must have seen many of them during his captivity. A set of four is now in the British Museum and came from the king's palace, Nineveh. Ezekiel's vision looks like an embellishment of the Chaldean Creed. Is the Biblical translation correct?</P>

<P>This glyph is often found in ancient writings. It is one of the figures that was used to symbolize the Four Great Primary Forces--the Sacred Four. It is composed of four circles, each with one of its sides incomplete.</P>

<IMG SRC="img/18601.jpg"></P>
<P>Another glyph symbolizing the Sacred Four. This was a very favorite symbol among the Uighurs and is revered by the Chinese today. I have also found it as a dress ornamentation among the South Sea Islanders especially the Polynesians.</P>

<P>This peculiar glyph is found in various parts of the earth, but not often. I have found it in writings where</P>
<P><A NAME="page_187"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 187</FONT></A></P>
<P>the ten tribes of people who went down with the Motherland at her destruction are spoken of.</P>

<P>Apparently this is a Maya symbol. I have found it in no other writings. It is found in the Maya description of the destruction of the Motherland. It reads: "Peaks only rise out of the abyss." It therefore refers to the islands that were formed between the gas chambers.</P>

<P>An equilateral triangle with the monotheistic symbol of the Deity within symbolizes: the triangle--Heaven, The circle within--the Deity, reading the Deity, the Infinite, dwells in Heaven, Heaven is His abode.</P>
<P>An equilateral triangle with an eye within symbolizes the Deity looking out from heaven. In Egypt it was changed to the all seeing Eye of Osiris looking down from heaven. These two symbols are found in all ancient writings. Rather, they appear in many writings and among all people.</P>
