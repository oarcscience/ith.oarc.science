### CHAPTER V

# SYMBOLS USED IN RELIGIOUS TEACHINGS

THE symbols which were used in the religious teachings of early man are
popularly known as the Sacred Symbols.

When symbols were first used it was to concentrate man's mind on the
Infinite One, so that by keeping his eyes on the symbol no outside
sights or sounds might call off his attention from the object of
worship. Man was most carefully taught that the symbol itself was not to
be worshipped; the symbol was only a picture to keep his mind from
wandering. He was carefully taught that there was only One Deity, but
that One Deity had many attributes which looked after health and
strength, rain and sunshine, crops; in fact, after the whole welfare of
mankind.

In the beginning three symbols only were used. When these were
understood, they were compounded and others added, and as time grew so
did the number of symbols, also their complexity, until we come down to
Egypt about 3,000 or 4,000 years ago, when there was such a riot of
symbols scarcely one temple understood the meaning of half the symbols
used in another.

<span id="page_119">p. 119</span>

The three original symbols which I have referred to are: *The Circle*,
*The Equilateral Triangle* and *The Square*.

<span id="img_11900"></span> ![](img/11900.jpg)

THE CIRCLE.--The Circle is a picture of the Sun and was the symbol of
the Infinite One. As it embraced all of His attributes it was the
Monotheistic Symbol. Being the Monotheistic Symbol it was considered the
Most Sacred Symbol of all. According to legend, the Sun was selected for
this symbol because it was the most powerful object that came within the
sight and understanding of man at that time.

The circle having no beginning and no ending also
symbolized:--everlasting, without end and infinity.

Before very long it is shown that the circle was being used to symbolize
so many things that it became necessary to specialize the circle when
using it as the Monotheistic Symbol of the Deity. The Nagas made an
addition by placing a dot in the center of the circle. The Uighurs added
a smaller circle within, making it a double circle.

Papyrus Anana: This is one of the most beautiful Egyptian writings that
I have come across. Anana was chief scribe and king's companion to the
gentle Seti II about 1320 B. C.

"Behold! is it not written in this roll? Read, ye who

<span id="page_120">p. 120</span>

shall find in the days unborn, if your gods have given you the skill.
Read, O children of the future, and learn the secrets of the past, which
to you is so far away, and yet in truth so near.

"Men do not live once only and then depart hence forever; they live many
times in many places, though not always in this world. That between each
life there is a veil of darkness.

"The doors will open at last, and show us all the chambers through which
our feet wandered from the beginning.

"Our religion teaches us that we live on eternally. Now eternity having
no end, can have had no beginning--*it is a circle*; therefore, if one
be true, namely that we live on forever, it would seem that the other
must be true also: namely, that we *have always lived*.

"To men's eyes God has many faces, and each one swears that the one he
sees is the only true God. Yet they are all wrong, for all are true.

"Our Kas, which are our spiritual selves, show them to us in various
ways. Drawing from the infinite well of wisdom that is hidden in the
being of every man, gives us glimpses of the truth, as they give us, who
are instructed, *power to work marvels*.

"The Spirit should not be judged by the body or the god by his house.

"Among the Egyptians the Scarabaeus Beetle is no god, but a symbol of
the Creator, because it rolls a ball of mud between its feet and sets
therein its eggs to hatch

<span id="page_121">p. 121</span>

as the Creator rolls the world around which seems to be round causing it
to produce life.

"All gods send their gift of love upon this earth, without which it
would cease to be. My faith teaches me more clearly perhaps than yours,
that life does not end with death, and therefore that love, being life's
soul, must endure while it endures.

"The strength of the invisible tie will bind two souls together long
after the world is dead.

"The spirits or souls of one incarnation possibly may meet again in
another incarnation, and may be drawn together as if by a magnet but for
what cause neither knows.

"Man comes into being many times, yet knows nothing of his past lives;
except occasionally some daydream or a thought carries him back to some
circumstance of a previous incarnation. He cannot, however, determine in
his mind when or where the circumstance occurred only that it is
something familiar. In the end, however, all of his various pasts will
reveal themselves."

Various forms and modifications of the Sun as Ra are to be found in the
ancient writings.

Fig. 5. This generally appears as a red sphere on tops of pillars and
monuments to the dead.

The foregoing Suns are all the Monotheistic Symbol of the Deity and
among the ancients was called Ra.

I will now take some pictures of the Sun appearing in ancient writings
as the celestial orb and not as Ra the Monotheistic symbol.

Fig. A. Is an eight-ray'd Sun. This was Mu's symbol on her Royal
Escutcheon. The name in the Motherland of the Sun as the celestial orb
was--Kin. In Egypt the name was--Horus. In Greece--Apollo and in
Babylonia--Belmarduk, et cetera.

Fig. B. A Sun with rays all around it represented the Sun at his
meridian in mid-heavens.

Fig. C. A rising Sun with rays, half the orb above the horizon, was the
symbol on the escutcheon of a colonial empire of Mu.

Fig. D. A Sun with half the orb above the horizon without rays had a
dual symbolization. It was the symbol of the setting Sun. It was also
the symbol of a colony of Mu, before it became a colonial empire.

Fig. E. The Lands of the West in darkness. The three-pointed figure is
Mu's numeral symbol as the Lands of the West. The Sun above without rays
says that no light reaches Mu--she is in darkness. A vignette from the
"Book of the Dead."

<span id="page_124">p. 124</span>

Fig. F. The Sacrifice of Mu. The Lotus above is Mu's floral symbol;
being shown withered and dying it symbolizes Mu as being dead. A rayless
Sun stands between Mu and the altar; therefore Mu is dead in the region
of darkness--on the altar as a sacrifice.

Fig. G. "Peaks only remain above the water." Mu is here depicted as
being dead and in darkness with only points or peaks remaining above the
water. Kin no longer shines upon her. Vignette from the Egyptian "Book
of the Dead."

THE EQUILATERAL TRIANGLE.--The equilateral triangle has a dual
significance, dependent upon where and how it is used. Its origin dates
back as solving to primitive man the emersion of the three lands which
formed the Land of Mu--the Lands of the West.

The Lands of the West consisted of a huge continental island and two
small ones, separated from the big one by narrow seas, called in the
Egyptian "canals." Tradition says that the big continental island was
first emerged and that the two small islands were subsequently emerged
at different periods. It was to explain this phenomenon, of the three
lands coming up at different periods, that the triangle was selected.

The equilateral triangle has three equal sides joined to one another and
forming a single unbroken line without ends.

It was pointed out to primitive man that it was the same Creator that
raised all three lands, each land being raised by separate commands:
Thus there were not

<span id="page_125">p. 125</span>

three Creators but only one. Apparently, to make it more understandable,
each was raised by a separate attribute.

This formed the first Triune Godhead whereon have been built the
enormous number of Pantheons that have permeated all ages. The
conception of a Triune Godhead has been handed down from the beginning
of religious teachings and still remains with us.

An equilateral triangle symbolized the Creator, and, as the Creator
dwells in Heaven, the triangle must necessarily symbolize heaven also;
for, where the Lord is, there is Heaven.

<span id="img_12500"></span> ![](img/12500.jpg)

I find this verified among the Egyptian symbols, as the glyph shows.
Here we find the Monotheistic Symbol of the Deity within the
triangle-within Heaven. Wherever or whenever the equilateral triangle is
met with in ancient writings or inscriptions, it is either in reference
to the Triune Godhead, or Heaven, or both.

At the time of Confucius, the Chinese Sage, about 500 B. C., in place of
the triangle the Chinese used a glyph in the form of the present-day
capital Y. This they called: "the Great Term," "the Great Unite," "the
Great Y." "The Y has neither body nor shape, all that has body and shape
was made by that which has no shape. The Great Term or the Great Unite
comprehends

<span id="page_126">p. 126</span>

three--One in three-and three in One."

THE FOUR-SIDED SQUARE.--The Four-sided Square completes the trilogy of
the first and original Sacred Symbols.

The square was selected as a conventional symbol of the earth for
apparently two reasons:--To prevent it from being confounded with the
Sun whose picture was a circle; and for the purpose of teaching to
primitive man the cardinal points North, South, East and West. Being
drawn as a square gave the earth "four corners" which were to be
explained as teaching developed. Later the four corners became the
positions of the "Four Great Pillars," one of the many names given to
the Four Great Primary Forces which emanate from the Creator. These
Forces first evolved law and order out of chaos and darkness; then
created the bodies of the Universe and all therein. They now continue
and uphold the work that they have accomplished, hence the name of
"Pillars" having been given to them. The next step was to appoint
keepers for the Pillars. These were known as the Genii.

Apparently, when the meanings of the foregoing three symbols were learnt
by primitive man, his next lesson was the compounding of these three
symbols.

TRIANGLE WITH THREE STARS.--Fig 1. The triangle here symbolizes Heaven.
The three stars within symbolize the three members of the Triune
Godhead. The Triune Godhead dwells in Heaven.

TRIANGLE WITH FIVE STARS.--Fig 2. The triangle

<span id="page_127">p. 127</span>

symbolizes Heaven. The five stars within symbolize the full Godhead of
Five, namely, the Deity and his Four Great Primary or Creative Forces.
The Deity with His Great Forces dwells in Heaven.

<span id="img_12700"></span> ![](img/12700.jpg)

A TRIANGLE SURMOUNTING A SQUARE. Fig. 3. This glyph is composed of the
four-sided square the symbol of the earth, with the triangle symbol of
Heaven surmounting it; thus showing Heaven above Earth. Above, in this
case, does not refer to altitude in any way. It means: that Heaven is on
a higher plane, where life is more perfect than here on earth. Thus this
symbol depicts Heaven as being more perfect than earth, more blissful
and happy.

A TRIANGLE SURMOUNTING A SQUARE AND THE TRIANGLE HAVING THREE STARS
WITHIN.--Fig. 4. In this symbol there is an addition of three stars
placed within the triangle, symbolizing that the Triune Godhead is in
Heaven, above the Earth. This symbol is to be seen on the end wall of an
end room of an ancient temple in Uxmal, Yucatan. This temple has been
called "The Temple of Sacred Mysteries" because there is an inscription
on a wall stating that the people came from \[paragraph continues\]

<span id="page_128">p. 128</span>

Mu and brought the Sacred Mysteries with them. In the room where this
symbol appears, the postulant received his second degree.

The temple was built about 11,500 to 12,000 years ago as shown by an
inscription on its walls which states, "that this temple was erected as
a monument to Mu."

A TRIANGLE SURMOUNTING A SQUARE AND THE TRIANGLE HAVING FIVE STARS
WITHIN.--Fig. 5. As previously stated five stars symbolize the full
Godhead of Five--The Deity and His Four Great Primary Forces. This
symbol is to be seen on the end of the wall of the opposite room to the
one previously mentioned in the Temple of Sacred Mysteries at Uxmal.
Here the postulant received his third degree, and was then prepared to
enter the Holy of Holies.

This ends the compounding of the three original symbols.

The Sacred Symbols:--The circle, triangle, square and pentagon became
the foundation of the wonderful geometrical. knowledge attained in Mu
and thoroughly entwined religion with science.

SYMBOLS OF MORTALITY.--A short space above the lintel of the entrance to
the sanctuary of the Temple of Sacred Mysteries at Uxmal, Yucatan, is a
cornice that surrounds the whole edifice. On it are sculptured the
symbols of mortality which are many times repeated. The emblems of
mortality occupied a very prominent place in ancient religion. It was
extensively used by the Mayas, Quiches, Egyptians, Hindus and
Babylonians

<span id="page_129">p. 129</span>

and was found in the writings and inscriptions of all ancient lands.

The emblems of mortality were used in the ancient religious ceremonies
to impress upon the postulant what his end would be and the end of all
mortality, and with this end in view impress upon him constantly the
necessity of living a life that would bring no terrors when the soul
releases itself from the body to pass into the world beyond.

<span id="img_12900"></span> ![](img/12900.jpg)

The Egyptian was a reflex of the Maya, and the Maya the teachings direct
from the Motherland so that, from Egypt, we can get the original
ceremonies with but immaterial changes. In the temple within the Great
Pyramid was found in one of the chambers a sarcophagus with the emblems
of mortality arranged alongside of it. The postulant was placed in the
sarcophagus; here he was reminded that after his soul leaves his mortal
body another life awaits him. This ceremony persists with the Freemasons
today.

<span id="page_130">p. 130</span>

The TAU (*Ta-oo*).--The Tau is not only one of the most interesting, but
it is one of the most ancient symbols, as it. is found repeatedly in the
oldest writings of the Motherland.

It is the symbol of both resurrection and emersion. Emersion is really
only a resurrection of land. I know of no country on the face of the
earth today that has not been under water several times-thus each time
it was emersed it was resurrected.

<span id="img_13000"></span> ![&lt;I&gt;The
Tau&lt;/I&gt;](img/13000.jpg.md)  
*The Tau*

The name today is as it was in the Motherland--Tau; it was Tau then and
it is Tau today. It is one of the very few words that has persisted
through all time without a change in any way. The name means "the stars
which bring the water." Ta--stars, and ha--water. The Marquesans today
pronounce it "Ta-ha" (the pure Motherland pronunciation).

The Tau is the picture of the constellation, the Southern Cross, the
most gorgeous group of stars appearing south of the equator. When the
Southern Cross appeared at a certain angle over Mu, the rainy season
commenced. The parched, dry land responded to the moisture from above.
Leaves, flowers and fruit sprang forth upon tree and shrub. Seeds in the
ground, that had been lying dead, germinated and sprang forth into life,
enriching

<span id="page_131">p. 131</span>

the land with golden grain. Mu became the land of plenty. Life had been
resurrected.

by air and water. The Tau is Mu emerged. This is from a Hindu carving
25,000 years old.

<span id="img_13400"></span> ![](img/13400.jpg)

THE DOUBLE TRIANGLE.--A pair of triangles bound together at their base,
thus forming a double triangle, was the ancient symbol for an offering,
and often appeared on the altar where offerings were made. These altars
were generally in the form of the Tau, or had a Tau carved on the face
of the altar. The rain brought by the Tau made offerings possible. These
offerings, generally, were in the form of flowers or fruit, or products
from the fields.

Before the destruction of Mu, sacrifices were unknown. Sacrifice was a
word coined to describe the awful destruction of the beloved Motherland.

The general position in which the double triangle was placed was
directly under the arms of the Tau, and in the ancient ritual these are
supposed to say or read, "Place thine offering upon this altar."

<span id="img_13401"></span> ![](img/13401.jpg)

THE TWO-SIDED SQUARE The two-sided square is known among the Masonic
brotherhood as the two-sided or Mason's square. It is a very ancient
glyph,

<span id="page_135">p. 135</span>

 

<span id="img_13500"></span>

[![&lt;I&gt;Group of Niven's Mexican Tablets showing the Two-sided
Square&lt;/I&gt;](tn/13500.jpg)  
Click to enlarge](img/13500.jpg.md)  
*Group of Niven's Mexican Tablets showing the Two-sided Square*  

 

<span id="page_136">p. 136</span>

reading "Builder," and apparently was first used in the crosses
symbolizing The Sacred Four when the name of the Great Builders of the
Universe was given to them. This glyph was placed within the arm or loop
of the cross which symbolized The Four Primary Forces, thus naming them
"Builders."

The two-sided square is on many of Niven's Mexican tablets. I am giving
a page of examples. In all of these tablets they are referring to the
Sacred Four as "The Great Builders of the Universe." Down to the time of
Mu's destruction, this symbol was used only to express builders as the
name of the Creative Forces.

When, however, thousands of years afterwards, we enter Egypt, we find
this symbol with a new vestment and a new name. Here it became the
symbol of justice and uprightness.

It has always been thought that this symbol originated in Egypt but it
goes back thousands of years beyond the commencement of Egyptian
history. The two-sided square is a symbol which is constantly found in
the Book of the Dead, also in various Egyptian papyrii. All seats where
either gods or goddesses are shown sitting are composed of the two-sided
square. In the Great Hall of Truth where Osiris is shown sitting in
judgment his seat is composed of the two-sided square.

The people of Egypt were taught that this symbol of the two-sided square
represented: "Right from wrong, to act on the square, to act rightly, to
act justly, to act truthfully according to Maat." To only the initiated
and

Truth. From the Egyptian "Book of the Dead," chapter 125.

<span id="page_138">p. 138</span>

the priesthood of Egypt was the actual meaning of this symbol known.
This is shown by the title and symbol of the god Ptah. Two of his titles
were "The Divine Artificer" and "The Divine Builder"; accompanying these
titles was the two-sided square. In all of the designs of Egyptian
Pillars, they symbolize the ancient and true meaning.

THE CUBE.--This symbol is especially interesting to Arch Masons. It is
found in the 64th Chapter of the Book of the Dead which is the oldest
and one of the most important chapters in this sacred volume, having
been written by Thoth at Sais at the commencement of Egyptian history
about 14,000 B. C. Translations of it vary somewhat but not materially.
The following are some of the translations.

M. Paul Pierret translated one of the sentences from the Turin Copy as:
"I am yesterday, and I know tomorrow, I am able to be born again."

London Papyrus reads: "I am yesterday, today and tomorrow."

The Ruberic says: "This chapter was found in the city of Khemennu upon a
block of iron from the South which had been inlaid with letters of real
Lapis Lazuli, under the foot of God during the reign of his majesty the
King of the North and the South Men-Kan-Ra triumphant by the royal son
Heru-Ta-Ta-f triumphant. He found it when he was journeying about to
make an investigation of the temples. One Neskit was with him who was
diligent in making him understand it, and he

<span id="page_139">p. 139</span>

brought it to the King as a wonderful object. When he saw that thing of
mystery which had never been seen or looked upon." London Papyrus dating
3733 B. C. *The cube* is what was found.

M. Paul Pierret's translation from the Turin Papyrus: "This chapter was
found out in Hermopolis on a brick of burnt clay, written in blue, under
the feet of the god *Thoth*. The finding out at the time of King
Menekara was made by Prince Har-titi-f in this place when he was
travelling to inspect the temples. It related in itself a hymn which
transported him into ecstasy. He brought it to the King's chariot as
soon as he saw *what was drawn on the cube*--a great mystery."

Papyrus Mes-em-neter dated 4266 B. C.: "This chapter was found in the
foundation of a plinth of the shrine of the Divine Hennu Boat by the
chief mason in the time of the King of the North and the South Hesepti
triumphant, and it is there directed that it shall be recited only by
one who is ceremoniously clean and pure."

<span id="page_140">p. 140</span>

THE INTERLACED TRIANGLES.--The crossed triangle is an exceedingly old
symbol. The oldest record of it that I have is in the Cosmogonic Diagram
of the Motherland which is the mother of all cosmogonic

<span id="img_14000"></span> ![&lt;I&gt;The Divine Hennu
Boat&lt;/I&gt;](img/14000.jpg.md)

diagrams. I did not find it in any of the Sacred Writings which I read,
but that is no criterion, nor does it say that it does not appear in the
Sacred Writings. There are over ten thousand tablets covering these
writings. I have only seen about three thousand out of the ten.

<span id="img_14001"></span> ![](img/14001.jpg)

The figure shows a central circle enclosed within a pair of triangles
crossed and interwoven. Again the two triangles are enclosed within an
outer circle which leaves twelve divisions between the two circles. The
central symbol, the circle, is the monotheistic symbol of the Deity; the
triangle of heaven, and the outer circle the Universe. The twelve
divisions between the two

<span id="page_141">p. 141</span>

circles are gates, "The twelve gates to heaven." Each gate was a virtue,
and these twelve gates must be opened by the twelve virtues before
heaven could be entered. Among the twelve virtues were first of all
Love; then followed Faith, Hope, Charity, et cetera.

THE FEATHER.--The feather is another of the very prominent Ancient
Sacred Symbols; it symbolized Truth.

Three feathers adorned the Crown of Mu. Three feathers were the ornament
on the head piece of Ra Mu, the King High Priest of Mu--Niven's Mexican
Stone Tablet No. 1780.

We find feathers as symbols among the Mayas, the difference in color
denoting the rank of the wearer. In Mu yellow was the color for royalty,
blue for the priesthood and red for soldiers and nobility. In these
ancient times yellow appears to have been the royal color throughout the
world. A dark blue is the mourning color in the Orient today. Research
shows that this color was adopted when Mu was sacrificed, and
corresponds with the color of her burial shroud--the blue waters of the
Pacific Ocean.

The feathers worn by the North American Indian today is a relic which he
has inherited from his forefathers. Whether they know the original
meaning of the feather, I cannot say. When on the warpath, however, they
color the ends of their feathers red, corresponding with the red
feathers of the soldiers and nobility of Mu.

In Egypt, however, we find more extensive information

<span id="page_142">p. 142</span>

 

<span id="img_14200"></span>

[![&lt;I&gt;The Feather Symbol of Truth&lt;/I&gt;](tn/14200.jpg)  
Click to enlarge](img/14200.jpg.md)  
*The Feather Symbol of Truth*  

 

<span id="page_143">p. 143</span>

about the feather. In the early Egyptian times, as in Mu, a straight
feather was used. About the time of Menes a curled ostrich feather was
used on all new symbolizations. The curled feather is in the headdress
of Osiris and Maat, and in the Great Hall of Truth an ostrich feather is
shown as being weighed against the heart of the deceased, the feather
symbolizing Truth.

Legend says that the feather was selected to symbolize Truth because a
puff of wind blows it away. Truth is just as liable and easy to be
frightened away as the feather is to be blown away.

The ancient name for the feather was Kukum, Ku or Kuk. Among the Mayas
of North America we find a serpent called Kukul Khan which translated
would be Khan--king, Kuk--feather, and ul--covered; so that a free
translation would be: The King of Serpents which is covered with
feathers. This corresponds with the Quiche Maya as recorded in their
Sacred Book the Popol Vuh.

Pillars as sacred symbols are of an extremely ancient origin. My
personal opinion is they date back to the *first* temple ever erected
for the worship of the Infinite One and that was more than 70,000 years
ago. The Pillar is one of the multitude of symbols which symbolize the
Four Great Creative Forces. They were first used at the doorway or
entrance to the temple. They were specialized in their construction and
shapes. From various old tablets and fallen ruins I have reconstructed a

A Pair of Ancient Pillars: The pillar on the left was square and capped
with the glyph <span id="img_14500"></span> ![](img/14500.jpg) strength.
The right hand pillar was round and capped with the glyph <span

established, built up, and by extension, finished, accomplished,
dependent on how and where used. Both pillars were in

four sections, to correspond with the Four Great Primary Forces, the
Four Great Gods, et cetera.

A Pillar Cross: The four arms of this cross are in

THE SACRED SYMBOLS OF MU shape like the ancient glyph for Pillar.
Connecting them all is shown their source, the great Creator. <span

reads "The Pillars have been established in strength."

*Temple Porch with Two Pillars*

Temple Porch with two Pillars: Niven's Mexican Stone Tablet No. 50, over
12,000 years old.

This temple has a dedication over the center of the

<span id="page_147">p. 147</span>

arch, the hieratic letter H <span id="img_14700"></span>
![](img/14700.jpg) in the alphabet of Mu. This was the alphabetical
symbol of the Four Creative Forces. So this temple was dedicated to the
Four Great primary Forces. Below are shown two pillars, each one has
four sections <span id="img_14701"></span> ![](img/14701.jpg) the
numeral four (Uighur form) corresponding to the four Primary Forces. The
left hand pillar is capped with the glyph <span id="img_14702"></span>
![](img/14702.jpg) strength, and the right hand one with the glyph <span
id="img_14703"></span> ![](img/14703.jpg) establish.

The ground plan of this temple which is on another tablet shows the left
hand pillar to be square and the right hand one round.

A very old written record, dating back to about 11,000 years, comes from
the Greek, and refers to the pillars of the temple dedicated to Poseidon
of Atlantis.

The foregoing I think clearly establishes the antiquity of pillars as
sacred symbols, with their shapes and meanings.

I shall now pass on to the Egyptians of much more recent time, taking
the period of about 1,000, to 4,500 B. C.

Egyptian Pillars: This is a group of pillars taken from the Book of the
Dead and various Egyptian Papyrii. By these it will be seen that the
Egyptians did not adhere to the patterns and details of the ancients,
but rather made a display of their imagination and artistry. Pillars
came to Egypt with both tides of colonists, the Eastern Line brought
them and the Western Line

<span id="page_148">p. 148</span>

 

<span id="img_14800"></span>

*Egyptian Pillars*  

 

<span id="page_149">p. 149</span>

brought them and between the two, new conceptions of what pillars ought
to be developed.

The Egyptians called them Tat Pillars. They are, however, better known
throughout the world as Totem Pillars.

The Egyptians called one pillar "Tat" which in their language means "in
strength." The other pillar they called "Tattu" which means "to
establish," and when conjoined, "In strength this place is established
for ever." The Egyptians considered the figure of a Tat an emblem of
strength and stability.

It will be noticed that all of the pillars in this group carry four
horizontal bars, in this way symbolizing the Four Great Primary Forces,
or, as they were more wont to call them:--"The Four Great Gods."

The entrance to Amenti taken from the papyrus Anana, one of the most
beautiful papyri I have ever seen. In Egyptian mythology, two Tats form
the entrance to Tattu. Tattu is the gateway to the region where the
mortal soul is blended with an immortal spirit and "established in the
mysteries of Amenti for ever."

In the porch or entrance to King Solomon's Temple two special pillars
were erected.

I Kings. Chap. 7, Verses 21-22. "And he set up the pillars in the porch
of the temple, and he set up the right pillar, and called the name
thereof Jachin, and he set up the left pillar, and called the name
thereof Boaz."

At the entrance of King Solomon's Temple, and at the Osirian Great Hall
of Truth, two pillars were

<span id="page_151">p. 151</span>

erected standing perpendicularly. In each case they have identically the
same meanings, language considered, with identically the same names.
Beyond this the ornamentation on the pillars--lily work--are also the
same: showing that King Solomon's pillars were a complete copy of the
pillars at the Great Hall of Truth; and while both change the pattern of
the pillars that they both retained their original meaning: that is,
they symbolized the work of the Four Great Primary Forces.

North American Indian: The Indians of our Northwestern states and of
western Canada erect Totem Poles and hold ceremonies at their base. I
have been unable to get anything about them except legend: but these
legends and carvings on the Totem Poles strongly confirm the fact that
the forefathers of those Indians came from Mu, and from that part of the
Motherland where the bird was their symbol of the Creator.

The Maoris of New Zealand: A common practice of the Maoris of New
Zealand is to erect Totem Poles or Pillars at the main entrance to their
villages.

The Karangs of Java: Forbes in writing says:--"In Java is a tribe called
Karangs, supposed to be the descendants of the aborigines of the island,
whose old men and youths, four times a year repair secretly, in
procession, to a sacred grove in a dense forest, the old men to worship,
the youths to see and learn the mysteries of their forefathers.

"In this grove are the ruins of terraces laid out in

<span id="page_152">p. 152</span>

quadrilateral enclosures, the boundaries of which are marked by blocks
of stone, or fixed in the ground. Here and there on the terraces are
prominent monuments, *erect pillars*, and especially noteworthy, *a
pillar erect within a square*.

"Here these despised and secluded people follow the rites and customs
that have been handed down to them from their forefathers through vastly
remote ages (about 12,000 years) repeating with superstitious awe a
litany which they do not understand or comprehend. This very litany is
found in the Egyptian Book of the Dead."

The Israelites in Egypt: While in Egypt the Israelites had two pillars
of red brick at the entrance of their poor little temples. In many of
their synagogues today, they erect two pillars at the entrance and say
they symbolize the legendary pillars of fire and smoke that accompanied
them during their exodus. What did their Egyptian Pillars symbolize?

Atlantis: Plato the Greek philosopher informs us that:--"The people of
Atlantis gathered every fifth and sixth year alternately and with
sacrifices of bulls swore to observe the sacred inscriptions carved on
the *pillars of the temple*."

Troano MS: I have found the following mistranslations in the Troano MS
Plate. <span id="img_15200"></span> ![](img/15200.jpg). This has been
translated "Can the King." The correct translation is "The Four Pillars
of the Earth." <span id="img_15201"></span> ![](img/15201.jpg) is the

letter M in the Motherland's alphabet. The alphabetical symbol for
mother, earth, land, et cetera, <span id="img_15400"></span>
![](img/15400.jpg) or <span id="img_15401"></span> ![](img/15401.jpg) is
the symbol for a pillar when the actual pillar is not shown; therefore,
this glyph reads:--"The four pillars at the four corners of the earth."
The whole of this plate is a mistranslation.

THE EIGHT ROADS TO HEAVEN.--The eight Roads to Heaven was a religious
symbolic teaching which I first found in the Cosmogonic Diagram of Mu
which attests its great antiquity. In this Cosmogonic Diagram it was
used to show man how he must live on this earth to be prepared to pass
into the world beyond when his call came. The eight Roads to Heaven was
not an actual conception; it was a symbolic teaching, religious in
character. These special teachings were unquestionably universal, as
they are found among ancient people throughout the world. Such form of
teaching must have been very popular since there were so many designs of
symbols for it. Every ancient people appear to have had their own idea
as to what design and figure best symbolized the eight Roads to Heaven.

<span id="img_15402"></span> ![](img/15402.jpg)

THE LIFE SYMBOL-CRUX ANSATA OR ANKH.--Although known now as an Egyptian
symbol only, like the Scarab it is very old. It is found in the writings

First Civilization, also carved on the stones of the North American
cliff dwellers or their predecessors. The Life Symbol is a compound of
two symbols. The O loop at the top symbolizes a mouth or gateway. It was
from the Egyptian that the symbol of Venus, the looped cross,
originated, and with its adoption a new vestment was given to it. With
Venus it symbolized the triumph of the spirit over bodily matter, the
soul over materialism. Venus was the Roman and Aphrodite the Greek. We
find, among the Egyptian relics, that many of the symbols were very much
ornamented. In the ancient writings I have only come upon plain,
unornamented ones: all of the Egyptian were, however, not ornamented. As
an example is the base on which the seat of Osiris rests in the Great
Hall of Truth. Here it is many times repeated. Among the cliff dwellers
or their predecessors, there is a tendency to curve the perpendicular
member of the cross, thus <span id="img_15501"></span>
![](img/15501.jpg), which has led many archaeologists astray, inducing
them to give the glyph an erroneous meaning.

THE ROADWAY OF THE SOUL.--I have found in my wanderings two figures
prominently placed, but never came across the name by which they are
called. As they are generally found on the outside of, and on the walls
and ceilings of, burial chambers, I have given them the name as shown in
the above caption. Some day perhaps their correct name may be known,
then this temporary name can be abandoned.

For many years the spiral figure, shown in cut, has

<span id="page_15600">p. 15600</span>

been a puzzle to me, as it has been found all along the line of the
great Uighur migration. The picture I am showing comes from New Grange,
County Meath, Ireland.

The figure is either an explanation of the esoteric or hidden meaning of
the hieratic letter N in Mu's alphabet, or the letter itself, highly
embellished, I cannot say which. After a careful study of many of the
writings of Mu in which the letter N appears, I find a slight variation
in them. Sometimes they are formed thus <span id="img_15600"></span>
![](img/15600.jpg), sometimes thus <span id="img_15601"></span>
![](img/15601.jpg). The difference is that in one the ends are left
open--in the other they are closed--there are no ends. As there are no
ends, the figure becomes a continuous line, returning to the starting
point, and proceeding on as it can find no place to stop. It is
therefore equivalent to a circle, which has no beginning or end.

In the picture shown from New Grange it will be seen the spirals have no
ends, but when the center is reached the line returns on itself. There
is no starting point in either of the spirals and no end given,
consequently, these spirals are also the equivalent of a circle.

In the Sacred Writings of Mu we are told man's soul lives on until
finally it reaches the source of its origin. Ana., 1320 B. C., Egyptian
Papyrus: "If we live on we must continue for ever, and if we continue
for ever, like the circle and eternity, man had no beginning."

Here we find two ancient references to man's soul

<span id="page_157">p. 157</span>

having no end nor beginning. These spirals have no end or beginning and
are generally found, associated with the passing on of the soul, in
burial chambers of the material body. A careful study of the symbol and
where and under what circumstances it is found leads me to the belief
that:--These hitherto unreadable spiral symbols give the hidden meaning
of the hieratic letter N--Mu's alphabet; that they are intended to
depict the continuance of the soul from one cycle to another, from one
incarnation to another, eventually ending whence it came. In the New
Grange picture which I have shown there are three spirals all running
into each other without an end. I take it that the third spiral is meant
to indicate the passing of the soul into the world beyond or maybe to
some other body in the Universe specially prepared to receive it.

On the walls of New Grange there are carved other symbols, spirals,
squares, zig-zags, et cetera.

<span id="img_15700"></span> ![](img/15700.jpg), A spiral with an end
pointing to the right is an ancient Uighur symbol meaning, "going to
somewhere." It is also found in Mexico and among the North American
Indians.

<span id="img_15701"></span> ![](img/15701.jpg) A spiral with an end
pointing left is the corresponding symbol, saying, "coming from."

<span id="img_15702"></span> ![](img/15702.jpg) The original cosmogonic
form or picture of the earth was a square. When placed flat it
symbolized the earth. When placed on end it was to show the four

<span id="page_158">p. 158</span>

cardinal points and in reference to the Four Pillars.

<span id="img_15800"></span> ![](img/15800.jpg) A square within a square
placed on end symbolizes that something has gone from it.

<span id="img_15801"></span> ![](img/15801.jpg) Is the Uighur mountain
and Chinese Yo; it is equivalent to the triangle. Freely read,
"ascended."

<span id="img_15802"></span> ![](img/15802.jpg) A zig-zag or
herring-bone with the points defined is the universal ancient symbol for
a tank fire, an abyss of molten fire without flames, prominent in
Egyptian symbology.

All these glyphs are on the stones of New Grange. I would not attempt to
write a legend without seeing the stones personally. No draughtsman ever
draws these ancient figures *as they are identically shown* on the
stones. This has been my experience. Consequently no reading, or
possibly an erroneous reading, would be made.

<span id="img_15803"></span> ![](img/15803.jpg)

This is a figure found under identically the same circumstances as the
previously mentioned spirals; found along the lines of the Mayas and
Carians running easterly from the Motherland. It is composed of the
hieratic letter H or rather two of the letters following one another but
connected with each other. The second is drawn in reverse of the first
one, symbolizing a return. \[paragraph continues\]

*The Tree and the Serpent*  

 

<span id="page_159">p. 159</span>

These also are generally found at the entrance of burial chambers.

THE TREE AND THE SERPENT.--This work would seem incomplete to me if I
omitted the Tree and the Serpent. Innumerable legends about the Serpent
and the Tree are found in religions. The tree is invariably called "Tree
of Life," and the serpent entwining it, "Tempter," or whatever else
signifies Satan. The Tree and the Serpent started as a legend, then
gradually drifted into myths: the climax being reached when the tree was
credited with its fantastic crop of apples. These apples became
necessary to carry out a myth for how otherwise could old Satan tempt
Eve to eat apples and Eve tempt Adam? They were needed to accomplish the
downfall of Adam. By this action poor woman has been made the cause of
every ill befalling mankind. It is a monumental piece of cowardice on
the part of man to put that responsibility on the shoulders of the
woman. The irony is that a man and not a woman was to blame. The Eve
alibi has stood for nearly 3,000 years but it must now be set aside. Had
Ezra been able to read correctly the symbols which appeared in the
writings of Moses, he would have given a very different version of the
wily old Serpent and the Tree of Life.

The small vignette comes from the Sacred Inspired Writings of Mu. These
Sacred Writings teach that there *is only one real life on this earth*,
which is the *Soul of Man*, and which these writings sometimes call *The
Man* also *The Inner Man*. It was taught that man's

<span id="page_160">p. 160</span>

material body was only a temporary habitation. All other forms which are
known to us as life are of a temporary nature also. They are taken from
the earth and to earth they must return. Of all the forms of earthly
creations, man only had an imperishable part which survived the material
body and lived on for ever; therefore *Man's Soul* was the only *true*
life on earth.

Man *first* appeared on earth in the *Land of Mu*; therefore the *first
actual life* on earth appeared in *Mu*. In these writings man is also
spoken of as a fruit. Trees bear fruit, and man was the *first fruit* of
a tree and the fruit was *life*. The Land of Mu was the Tree of Life.
Thus Mu was symbolized as a tree--the Tree of Life.

In the vignette, the tree is shown as having a serpent coiled around it,
thus *surrounding* the tree. It is an unadorned serpent, therefore it is
Khan the symbol of Khanab, "The Great Waters," the ocean. Here it is
symbolically shown that Mu was surrounded by water. Mu had no land
connections with any other continental land. *The Serpent is the waters
surrounding Mu*.

The foregoing shows and intelligently explains what the Tree of Life
was, and *why* a Serpent is coiled around it. What Moses undoubtedly
wrote were plain facts, in symbolical language--a symbolically written
history, true in all respects. Translations, erroneous and misleading,
perverted his writings.

THE ANCIENT MEANINGS OF CERTAIN NUMERALS.--The number 3 is now commonly
called the lucky number. Why? We must go back to tradition to tell us.

<span id="page_161">p. 161</span>

On one occasion, I asked the old Rishi, "Do you know why we call the
numeral three, the lucky number?" His answer was, "I can only surmise;
what is three the symbol of?" My answer was, "Heaven and the Triune
Godhead and, yes, the numeral symbol of the Motherland of Mu." He
answered: "Don't you think man was lucky to have a Motherland, and more
so to know that he will not meet the fate of the Motherland?"

He then turned and said to me: "Four is the lucky numeral because it is
the Four Great Primary Forces that have charge of us and care for our
material bodies through their earthly lives and their numeral is Four.
In ancient times, Four stood amongst the most revered numbers, but today
it is almost--if not entirely--forgotten. Possibly the mythical
teachings of modern science has much to do with this loss. As Three is
looked upon as the Lucky Number, Seven is looked upon as the Sacred
Number."

THE SACRED SEVEN.--The original sacred Seven was the Seven Great
Commands of the Creator. These were given to the Four Great Primary
Forces, to carry out "his will, command or wishes," thus emanating from
the Creator. They are the Creative Forces of the Almighty.

The predilection of ancient peoples in their sacred ceremonies for the
use of the numeral Seven is very great and conspicuous.

The ancients counted in fives to avoid mentioning ten. Ten was the
numeral of the Deity; therefore too sacred to be mentioned. Ten was
counted twice five, fifteen three times five and so on up to twenty.

I will take one more example in numerals--the number 13. Thirteen is
always looked upon as unlucky especially when in connection with Friday.

Mu, the Motherland, was destroyed on a Friday, the 13th day of the Month
of Zac (the white month). The memory of that day, the 13th, has been
carried down as an unlucky day for mankind.
