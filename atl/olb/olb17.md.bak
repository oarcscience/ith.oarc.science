### <span class="smallcaps">These are the Three Principles on which these Laws are founded.</span>

1\. Everybody knows that he requires the necessaries of life, and if he
cannot obtain them he does not know how to preserve his life.

2\. All men have a natural desire to have children, and if it is not
satisfied they are not aware what evil may spring from it.

3\. Every man knows that he wishes to live free and undisturbed, and
that others wish the same thing.

To secure this, these laws and regulations are made.

The people of Finda have also their rules and regulations, but these are
not made according to what is just—only for the advantage of priests and
princes—therefore their states are fall of disputes and murder.

1\. If any man falls into a state of destitution, his case must be
brought before the count by the maidens, because a high-minded Frisian
cannot bear to do that himself.

2\. If any man becomes poor because he will not work, he must be sent
out of the country, because the cowardly and lazy are troublesome and
ill-disposed, therefore they ought to be got rid of.

3\. Every young man ought to seek a bride and to be married at
five-and-twenty.

4\. If a young man is not married at five-and-twenty, he must be driven
from his home, and the younger men must avoid him. If then he will not
marry, he must be declared dead, and leave the country, so that he may
not give offence.

5\. If a man is impotent, he must openly declare that no one has
anything to fear from him, then he may come or go where he likes.

6\. If after that he commits any act of incontinence, then he must flee
away; if he does not, he may be given over to the vengeance of those
whom he has offended, and no one may aid him.

7\. Any one who commits a theft shall restore it threefold. For a second
offence he shall be Bent to the tin mines. The person robbed may forgive
him if he pleases, but for a third offence no one shall protect him.
