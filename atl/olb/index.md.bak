In the 19th century, ascendant nationalism in Europe used local folklore
and ancient legends to bolster a sense of identity. One curious example
of this is the Oera Linda Book, a controversial manuscript, dated 1256,
from the Frisian region of the Netherlands. The Oera Linda book is today
conventionally agreed to be a forgery, written during the mid-19th
century. This is based on the paper which the manuscript is written on,
as well as internal and linguistic evidence.

Purporting to be an episodic chronicle of wars and migrations of the
Frisian people, the Oera Linda Book describes events dated (very
precisely) from 2194 BCE to 803 CE. The reference date is the
submergence of 'Atland,' a lost land in the North Sea, which, according
to the book, occurred in 2193 BCE. The book is peppered with
descriptions of catastrophic earth changes, including volcanic
eruptions, strange weather, and rapid sea level changes. This is
intriguing because, even if a forgery, the Oera Linda Book predates the
origin of the modern Atlantis craze, which began with Ignatius
Donnelly's [Atlantis, the Antediluvian World](../ataw/index.md), published
in 1882.

The Oera Linda Book also claims that Europe was ruled by a (mostly)
peaceful, just matriarchy for most of its history, and that the Frisians
invented writing. There is a dark side, too: parts of the Oera Linda
Book have touches of bigotry and intolerance which will be galling to
most modern readers. This mix of themes have led to a continued
fascination with this text, regardless of its authenticity.

<span class="small">PRODUCTION NOTES: I was unable to obtain a printed
copy of this edition, so I printed out and scanned back in a Google page
image PDF, which does not give the best OCR yield. Hence there may still
be OCR errors lurking in this text. I had to omit the parallel Frisian
text on facing pages for technical reasons. Most of the footnotes in the
body of the text had to be placed at an inferred position, as for the
most part the footnotes refer to the Frisian text, not the English. For
this reason the place name references in the footnotes are logically
reversed. As far as I can tell, this is the first time that an
unmodified transcript of this translation of the Oera Linda Book has
appeared online.--J.B. Hare, January 29th, 2009.</span>
