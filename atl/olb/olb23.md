### <span class="smallcaps">This is inscribed on the Waraburgt by the Aldegamude.</span>

The Waraburgt is not a maiden's city, but the place where

<span id="page_72">p. 72</span> <span id="page_73">p. 73</span>

all the foreign articles brought by sailors were stored. It lies three
hours south from Medeasblik.

*Thus is the Preface*.

Hills, bow your heads; weep, ye streams and clouds. Yes.
Schoonland <span id="fr_15"></span>[\*](#fn_15) (Scandinavia.md) blushes,
an enslaved people tramples on your garment, O Frya.

*This is the history*.

One hundred and one years after the submersion of Aldland <span
id="fr_16"></span>[†](#fn_16.md) a people came out of the East. That people
was driven by another. Behind us, in Twiskland (Germany), they fell into
disputes, divided into two parties, and each went its own way. Of the
one no account has come to us, but the other came in the back of our
Schoonland, which was thinly inhabited, particularly the upper part.
Therefore they were able to take possession of it without contest, and
as they did no other harm, we would not make war about it. Now that we
have learned to know them, we will describe their customs, and after
that how matters went between us. They were not wild people, like most
of Finda's race; but, like the Egyptians, they have priests and also
statues in their churches. The priests are the only rulers; they call
themselves Magyars, and their headman Magy. He is high priest and king
in one. The rest of the people are of no account, and in subjection to
them. This people have not even a name; but we call them Finns, because
although all the festivals are melancholy and bloody, they are so formal
that we are inferior to them in that respect. But still they are not to
be envied, because they are slaves to their priests, and still more to
their creeds. They believe that evil spirits abound everywhere, and
enter into men and beasts, but of Wr-alda's spirit they know nothing.
They have weapons of stone, the Magyars of copper. The Magyars affirm
that they can exorcise

<span id="page_74">p. 74</span> <span id="page_75">p. 75</span>

and recall the evil spirits, and this frightens the people, so that you
never see a cheerful face. When they were well established, the Magyars
sought our friendship, they praised our language and customs, our cattle
and iron weapons, which they would willingly have exchanged for their
gold and silver ornaments, and they always kept their people within
their own boundaries, and that outwitted our watchfulness.

Eighty years afterwards, just at the time of the Juulfeest, they overran
our country like a snowstorm driven by the wind. All who could not flee
away were killed. Frya was appealed to, but the Schoonlanders
(Scandinavians) had neglected her advice. Then all the forces were
assembled, and three hours from Godasburgt <span
id="fr_17"></span>[\*](#fn_17.md) they were withstood, but war continued.
Kat or Katerine was the name of the priestess who was Burgtmaagd of
Godasburgt. Kat was proud and haughty, and would neither seek counsel
nor aid from the mother; but when the Burgtheeren (citizens) knew this,
they themselves sent messengers to Texland to the Eeremoeder. Minna—this
was the name of the mother—summoned all the sailors and the young men
from Oostflyland and Denmark. From this expedition the history of Wodin
sprang, which is inscribed on the citadels, and is here copied. At
Aldergamude <span id="fr_18"></span>[†](#fn_18.md) there lived an old
sea-king whose name was Sterik, and whose deeds were famous. This old
fellow had three nephews. Wodin, the eldest, lived at Lumkamakia <span
id="fr_19"></span>[‡](#fn_19.md), near the Eemude, in Oostflyland, with his
parents. He had once commanded troops. Teunis and Inka were naval
warriors, and were just then staying with their father at Aldergamude.
When the young warriors had assembled together, they chose Wodin to be
their leader or king, and the naval force chose Teunis for their
sea-king and Inka for their admiral. The navy then sailed to Denmark,
where they took on board Wodin and his valiant host.

<span id="page_76">p. 76</span> <span id="page_77">p. 77</span>

The wind was fair, so they arrived immediately <span
id="fr_20"></span>[\*](#fn_20.md) in Schoonland. When the northern brothers
met together, Wodin divided his powerful army into three bodies. Frya
was their war-cry, and they drove back the Finns and Magyars like
children. When the Magy heard how his forces had been utterly defeated,
he sent messengers with truncheon and crown, who said to Wodin: O
almighty king we are guilty, but all that we have done was done from
necessity. You think that we attacked your brothers out of illwill, but
we were driven out by our enemies, who are still at our heels. We have
often asked your Burgtmaagd for help, but she took no notice of us. The
Magy says that if we kill half our numbers in fighting with each other,
then the wild shepherds will come and kill all the rest. The Magy
possesses great riches, but he has seen that Frya is much more powerful
than all our spirits together. He will lay down his head in her lap. You
are the most warlike king on the earth, and your people are of iron.
Become our king, and we will all be your slaves. What glory it would be
for you if you could drive back the savages! Our trumpets would resound
with your praises, and the fame of your deeds would precede you
everywhere. Wodin was strong, fierce, and warlike, but he was not
clear-sighted, therefore he was taken in their toils, and crowned by the
Magy.

Very many of the sailors and soldiers to whom this proceeding was
displeasing went away secretly, taking Kat with them. But Kat, who did
not wish to appear before either the mother or the general assembly,
jumped overboard. Then a storm arose and drove the ships upon the banks
of Denmark, with the total destruction of their crews. This strait was
afterwards called the Kattegat <span id="fr_21"></span>[†](#fn_21.md). When
Wodin was crowned, he

<span id="page_78">p. 78</span> <span id="page_79">p. 79</span>

attacked the savages, who were all horsemen, and fell upon Wodin's <span
id="fr_22"></span>[\*](#fn_22.md) troops like a hailstorm; but like a
whirlwind they were turned back, and did not dare to appear again. When
Wodin returned, Magy gave him his daughter to wife. Whereupon he was
incensed with herbs; but they were magic herbs, and by degrees he became
so audacious that he dared to disavow and ridicule the spirits of Frya
and Wr-alda, while he bent his free head before the false and deceitful
images. His reign lasted seven years, and then he disappeared. The Magy
said that he was taken up by their gods and still reigned over us, but
our people laughed at what they said. When Wodin had disappeared some
time, disputes arose. We wished to choose another king, but the Magy
would not permit it. He asserted that it was his right given him by his
idols. But besides this dispute there was one between the Magyars and
Finns, who would honour neither Frya nor Wodin; but the Magy did just as
he pleased, because his daughter had a son by Wodin, and he would have
it that this son was of high descent. While all were disputing and
quarrelling, he crowned the boy as king, and set up himself as guardian
and counsellor. Those who cared more for themselves than for justice let
him work his own way, but the good men took their departure. Many
Magyars fled back with their troops, and the sea-people took ship,
accompanied by a body of stalwart Finns as rowers.

Next comes upon the stage the history of Neef Teunis and Neef Inka.
