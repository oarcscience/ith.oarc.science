### <span class="smallcaps">What Friso did further.</span>

Of his first wife he still had two brothers-in-law, who were very
daring. Hetto—that is, heat—the youngest, he sent as messenger to
Kattaburgt, which

<span id="page_204">p. 204</span> <span id="page_205">p. 205</span>

lies far in the Saxsenmarken. Friso gave him to take seven horses,
besides his own, laden with precious things stolen by the sea-rovers.
With each horse there were two young sea-rovers and two young horsemen,
clad in rich garments, and with money in their purses. In the same way
as he sent Hetto to Kattaburgt, he sent Bruno that is, brown—the other
brother-in-law, to Mannagarda oord. Mannagarda oord was written
Mannagarda ford in the earlier part of this book <span
id="fr_77"></span>[\*](#fn_77.md), but that is wrong. All the riches that
they took with them were given away, according to circumstances, to
princes, princesses, and chosen young girls. When his young men went to
the tavern to dance with the young people there, they ordered baskets of
spice, gingerbread, and tuns of the best beer. After these messengers he
let his young people constantly go over to the Saxsenmarken, always with
money in their purses and presents to give away, and they spent money
carelessly in the taverns. When the Saxsen youths looked with envy at
this they smiled, and said, If you dare go and fight the common enemy
you would be able to give much richer presents to your brides, and live
much more princely. Both the brothers-in-law of Friso had married
daughters of the chief princes, and afterwards the Saxsen youths and
girls came in whole troops to the Flymeer.

The burgtmaidens and old maidens who still remembered their greatness
did not hold with Friso's object, and therefore they said no good of
him; but Friso, more cunning than they, let them chatter, but the
younger maidens he led to his side with golden fingers. They said
everywhere, For a long time we have had no mother, but that comes from
our being fit to take care of ourselves. At present it suits us best to
have a king to win back our lands that we have lost through the
imprudence of our mothers.

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Further they said,
Every child of Frya has permission to let his voice be heard before the
choice of a prince is decided; but if it comes to that, that you choose
a king, then also we will have our say. From all that we can see,
Wr-alda has appointed Friso for it, for he has brought him here in a
wonderful way. Friso knows the tricks of the Gauls, whose language he
speaks; he can therefore watch against their craftiness. Then there is
something else to keep the eye upon. What count could be chosen as king
without the others being jealous of him? All such nonsense the young
maidens talked; but the old maidens, though few in number, tapped their
advice out of another cask. They said always and to every one: Friso
does like the spiders. At night he spreads his webs in all directions,
and in the day he catches in them all his unsuspecting friends. Friso
says he cannot suffer any priests or foreign princes, but we say that he
cannot suffer anybody but himself; therefore he will not allow the
citadel of Stevie to be rebuilt; therefore he will not have the mother
again. To-day Friso is your counsellor, to-morrow he will be your king,
in order to have full power over you. Among the people there now existed
two parties. The old and the poor wished to have the mother again, but
the young and the warlike wished for a father and a king. The first
called themselves mother's sons, the others father's sons, but the
mother's sons did not count for much; because there were many ships to
build, there was a good time for all kinds of workmen. Moreover, the
sea-rovers brought all sorts of treasures, with which the maidens were
pleased, the girls were pleased, and their relations and friends.

When Friso had been nearly forty years at Staveren he died <span
id="fr_78"></span>[\*](#fn_78.md). Owing to him many of the states had been
joined together again, but that we were the better for it I am not
prepared to certify. Of all the counts that preceded him there was none
so renowned as Friso; for, as I said before, the young maidens spoke in
his praise, while the old maidens did all in their power to make him
hateful to everybody. Although the old women could not prevent his
meddling, they made so much fuss that he died without becoming king.
