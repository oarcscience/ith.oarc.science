### <span class="smallcaps">The Second Writing.</span>

Fifteen months after the last general assembly, at the festival of the
harvest month, everybody gave himself

up to pleasure and merry-making, and no one thought of anything but
diversion; but Wr-alda wished to teach us that watchfulness should never
be relaxed. In the midst of the festivities the fog came and enveloped
every place in darkness. Cheerfulness melted away, but watchfulness did
not take its place. The coastguard deserted their beacons, and no one
was to be seen on any of the paths. When the fog rose, the sun scarcely
appeared among the clouds; but the people all came out shouting with
joy, and the young folks went about singing to their bagpipes <span
id="fr_50"></span>[\*](#fn_50.md), filling the air with their melody. But
while every one was intoxicated with pleasure, treachery had landed with
its horses and riders. As usual, darkness had favoured the wicked, and
they had slipped in through the paths of Linda's wood. Before Adela's
door twelve girls led twelve lambs, and twelve boys led twelve calves. A
young Saxon bestrode a wild bull which he had caught and tamed. They
were decked with all kinds of flowers, and the girls’ dresses were
fringed with gold from the Rhine.

When Adele came out of her house, a shower of flowers fell on her head;
they all cheered loudly, and the fifes of the boys were heard over
everything. Poor Adele! poor people! how short will be your joy! When
the procession was out of sight, a troop of Magyar soldiers rushed up to
Adela's house. Her father and her husband were sitting on the steps. The
door was open, and within stood Adelbrost her son. When be saw the
danger of his parents, he took his bow from the wall and shot the leader
of the pirates, who staggered and fell on the grass. The second and
third met a similar fate. In the meantime his parents had seized their
weapons, and went slowly to Jon's house. They would soon have been
taken, but

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Adela came. She
had learned in the burgt to use all kinds of weapons. She was seven feet
high, and her sword was the same length. She waved it three times over
her head, and each time a knight bit the earth. Reinforcements came, and
the pirates were made prisoners; but too late—an arrow had penetrated
her bosom! The treacherous Magy had poisoned it, and she died of it.
