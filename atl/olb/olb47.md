### <span class="smallcaps">Now I will write about his son Adel.</span>

Friso, who had learned our history from the book of the Adelingen, had
done everything in his power to win their friendship. His eldest son,
whom he had by his wife Swethirte, he named Adel; and although he strove
with all his might to prevent the building or restoring any citadels, he
sent Adel to the citadel of Texland in order to make himself better
acquainted with our laws, language, and customs. When Adel was twenty
years old Friso brought him into his own school, and when he had fully
educated him he sent him to travel through all the states. Adel was an
amiable young man, and in his travels he made many friends, so the
people called him Atharik—that is, rich in friends—which was very useful
to him afterwards, for when his father died he took his place without a
question of any other count being chosen.

While Adel was studying at Texland there was a lovely maiden at the
citadel. She came from Saxenmarken, from the state of Suobaland,
therefore she was called at Texland Suobene <span
id="fr_79"></span>[†](#fn_79.md), although her name

<span id="page_210">p. 210</span> <span id="page_211">p. 211</span>

was Ifkja. Adel fell in love with her, and she with him, but his father
wished him to wait a little. Adel did as he wished; but as soon as he
was dead, sent messengers to Berthold, her father, to ask her in
marriage. Berthold was a prince of high-principled feelings. He had sent
his daughter to Texland in the hope that she might be chosen Burgtmaagd
in her country, but when he knew of their mutual affection he bestowed
his blessing upon them. Ifkja was a clever Frisian. As far as I have
been able to learn, she always toiled and worked to bring the Frya's
people back under the same laws and customs. To bring the people to her
side, she travelled with her husband through all Saxenmarken, and also
to Geertmannia—as the Geertmen had named the country which they had
obtained by means of Goss. Thence they went to Denmark, and from Denmark
by sea to Texland. From Texland they went to Westflyland, and so along
the cost to Walhallagara; thence they followed the Zuiderryn (the Waal),
till, with great apprehension, they arrived beyond the Rhine at the
Marsaten of whom our Apollonia has written <span
id="fr_80"></span>[\*](#fn_80.md). When they had stayed there a little
time, they returned to the lowlands. When they had been some time
descending towards the lowlands <span id="fr_81"></span>[†](#fn_81.md), and
had reached about the old citadel of Aken, four of their servants were
suddenly murdered and stripped. They had loitered a little behind. My
brother, who was always on the alert, had forbidden them to do so, but
they did not listen to him. The murderers that had committed this crime
were Twisklanders, who had at that time audaciously crossed the Rhine to
murder and to steal. The Twisklanders are banished and fugitive children
of Frya,

<span id="page_212">p. 212</span> <span id="page_213">p. 213</span>

but their wives they have stolen from the Tartars. The Tartars are a
brown tribe of Finda's people, who are thus named because they make war
on everybody. They are all horsemen and robbers. This is what makes the
Twisklanders so bloodthirsty. The Twisklanders who had done the wicked
deed called themselves Frijen or Franken. There were among them, my
brother said, red, brown, and white men. The red and brown made their
hair white with lime-water <span id="fr_82"></span>[\*](#fn_82.md)—but as
their faces remained brown, they were only the more ugly. In the same
way as Apollonia, they visited Lydasburgt and the Alderga. Afterwards
they made a tour of all the neighbourhood of Stavera. They behaved with
so much amiability, that everywhere the people wished to keep them.
Three months later, Adel sent messengers to all the friends that he had
made, requesting them to send to him their "wise men" in the month of
May. <span id="fr_83"></span>[†](#fn_83.md)

<span id="page_214">p. 214</span> <span id="page_215">p. 215</span>

his wife, he said, who had been maagd of Texland, had received a copy of
it. In Texland many writings are still found which are not copied in the
book of the Adelingen. One of these writings had been placed by Goss
with her last will, which was to be opened by the oldest maiden,
Albetha, as soon as Friso was dead.
