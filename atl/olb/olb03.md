<span class="smallcaps">OKKE MY SON—</span>

You must preserve these books with body and soul. They contain the
history of all our people, as well as of our forefathers. Last year I
saved them in the flood, as well as you and your mother; but they got
wet, and therefore began to perish. In order not to lose them, I copied
them on foreign paper.

In case you inherit them, you must copy them likewise, and your children
must do so too, so that they may never be lost.

Written at Liuwert, in the three thousand four hundred and forty-ninth
year after Atland was submerged—that is, according to the Christian
reckoning, the year 1256. Hiddo, surnamed Over de Linda.—Watch. <span

Beloved successors, for the sake of our dear forefathers, and of our
dear liberty, I entreat you a thousand times never let the eye of a monk
look on these writings. They are very insinuating, but they destroy in
an underhand manner all that relates to us Frisians. In order to gain
rich benefices, they conspire with foreign kings, who know that we are
their greatest enemies, because we dare to speak to their people of
liberty, rights, and the duties of princes. Therefore they seek to
destroy all that we derive from our forefathers, and all that is left of
our old customs.

Ah, my beloved ones! I have visited their courts! If Wr-alda permits it,
and we do not chew ourselves strong to resist, they will altogether
exterminate us.

*Anno Domini* 803.
