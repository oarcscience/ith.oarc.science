### <span class="smallcaps">These Rules are made for Angry People.</span>

1\. If a man in a passion or out of illwill breaks another's limb or
puts out an eye or a tooth, he must pay whatever the injured man
demands. If he cannot pay, he must suffer the same injury as he has done
to the other. If he refuses this, he must appeal to the Burgtmaagd in
order to be sent to work in the iron or tin mines until he has expiated
his crime under the general law.

2\. If a man is so wicked as to kill a Frisian, he must forfeit his own
life; but if the Burgtmaagd can send him to the tin mines for his life
before he is taken, she may do so.

3\. If the prisoner can prove by proper witnesses that

the death was accidental, he may go free; but if it happens a second
time, he must go to the tin mines, in order to avoid any unseemly hatred
or vengeance.
