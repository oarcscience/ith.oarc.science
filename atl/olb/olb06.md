### <span class="smallcaps">This Has Fasta Spoken.</span>

All the regulations which have existed a century, that is, a hundred
years, may by the advice of the Eeremoeder, with the consent of the
community, be inscribed upon the walls of the citadel, and when
inscribed on the walls they become laws, and it is our duty to respect
them all. If by force or necessity any regulations should be imposed
upon ne at variance with our laws and customs, we must submit; but
should we be released, we must always return to our own again. That is
Frya's will, and must be that of all her children.

### FASTA SAID—

Anything that any man commences, whatever it may be, on the day
appointed for Frya's worship shall eternally fail, for time has proved
that she was right; and it is become a law that no man shall, except
from absolute necessity, keep that day otherwise than as a joyful feast.
