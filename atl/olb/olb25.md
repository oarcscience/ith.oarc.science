### <span class="smallcaps">What the Consequence of this was.</span>

In the northernmost part of the Mediterranean there lies an island close
to the coast. They now came and asked to buy that, on which a general
council was held.

The mother's advice was asked, and she wished to see them at some
distance, so she saw no harm in it; but as we afterwards saw what a
mistake we had made, we called the island Missellia <span
id="fr_29"></span>[‡](#fn_29) (Marseilles). Hereafter will be seen what
reason we had. The Golen <span id="fr_30"></span>[§](#fn_30), as the
missionary priests of Sidon were called, had observed that the land
there was thinly peopled, and was far from the mother. In order to make
a favourable impression, they had themselves called in our language
*followers of the truth;* but they had better have been called
*abstainers from the truth*, or, in short, "Triuwenden," as our
seafaring people afterwards called them. When they were well
established, their merchants exchanged their beautiful copper weapons
and all sorts of jewels for our iron weapons and hides of wild beasts,
which were abundant in our southern

countries; but the Golen celebrated all sorts of vile and monstrous
festivals, which the inhabitants of the coast promoted with their wanton
women and sweet poisonous wine. If any of our people had so conducted
himself that his life was in danger, the Golen afforded him a refuge,
and sent him to Phonisia, that is, Palmland. When he was settled there,
they made him write to his family, friends, and connections that the
country was so good and the people so happy that no one could form any
idea of it. In Britain there were plenty of men, but few women. When the
Golen knew this, they carried off girls everywhere and gave them to the
Britons for nothing. So all these girls served their purpose to steal
children from Wr-alda in order to give them to false gods.
