### <span class="smallcaps">From Minno's Writings.</span>

When Nyhalennia <span id="fr_7"></span>[\*](#fn_7.md), whose real name was
Min-erva, was well established, and the Krekalanders <span
id="fr_8"></span>[†](#fn_8.md) loved her as well as our own people did,
there came some princes and priests to her citadel and asked Min-erva
where her possessions lay. Hellenia answered, I carry my possessions in
my own bosom. What I have inherited is the love of wisdom, justice, and
freedom. If I lose these I shall become as the least of your slaves; now
I give advice for nothing, but then I should sell it. The gentlemen went
away laughing and saying, Your humble servants, wise Hellenia. But they
missed their object, for the people took up this name as a name of
honour. When they saw that

<span id="page_50">p. 50</span> <span id="page_51">p. 51</span>

their shot had missed they began to calumniate her, and to say that she
had bewitched the people; but our people and the good Krekalanders
understood at once that it was calumny. She was once asked, If you are
not a witch, what is the use of the eggs that you always carry with you?
Min-erva answered, These eggs are the symbols of Frya's counsels, in
which our future and that of the whole human race lies concealed. Time
will hatch them, and we must watch that no harm happens to them. The
priests said, Well answered; but what is the use of the dog on your
right hand? Hellenia replied, Does not the shepherd have a sheep-dog to
keep his flock together? What the dog is to the shepherd I am in Frya's
service. I must watch over Frya's flocks. We understand that very well,
said the priests; but tell us what means the owl that always sits upon
your head, is that light-shunning animal a sign of your clear vision?
No, answered Hellenia; he reminds me that there are people on earth who,
like him, have their homes in churches and holes, who go about in the
twilight, not, like him, to deliver us from mice and other plagues, but
to invent tricks to steal away the knowledge of other people, in order
to take advantage of them, to make slaves of them, and to suck their
blood like leeches. Another time they came with a whole troop of people,
when the plague was in the country, and said; We are all making
offerings to the gods that they may take away the plague. Will you not
help to turn away their anger, or have you yourself brought the plague
into the land with all your arts? No, said Min-erva; I know no gods that
do evil, therefore I cannot ask them to do better. I only know one good
spirit, that is Wr-alda's; and as he is good be never does evil. Where,
then, does evil come from? asked

<span id="page_52">p. 52</span> <span id="page_53">p. 53</span>

the priests. All the evil comes from you, and from the stupidity of the
people who let themselves be deceived by you. If, then, your god is so
exceedingly good, why does he not turn away the bad? asked the priests.
Hellenia answered: Frya has placed us here, and the carrier, that is,
Time, must do the rest. For all calamities there is counsel and remedy
to be found, but Wr-alda wills that we should search it out ourselves,
in order that we may become strong and wise. If we will not do that, he
leaves us to our own devices, in order that we may experience the
results of wise or foolish conduct. Then a prince said, I should think
it best to submit. Very possibly, answered Hellenia; for then men would
be like sheep, and you and the priests would take care of them, shearing
them and leading them to the shambles. This is what our god does not
desire, he desires that we should help one another, but that all should
be free and wise. That is also our desire, and therefore our people
choose their princes, counts, councillors, chiefs, and masters among the
wisest of the good men, in order that every man shall do his best to be
wise and good. Thus doing, we learn ourselves and teach the people that
being wise and acting wisely can alone lead to holiness. That seems very
good judgment, said the priests; but if you mean that the plague is
caused by our stupidity, then Nyhellenia will perhaps be so good as to
bestow upon us a little of that new light of which she is so proud. Yes,
said Hellenia, but ravens and other birds of prey feed only on dead
carrion, whereas the plague feeds not only on carrion but on bad laws
and customs and wicked passions. If yon wish the plague to depart from
you and not return, you must put away your bad passions and become pure
within and without. We admit that the advice is good, said the priests,
but how shall we induce all the people under our rule

<span id="page_54">p. 54</span> <span id="page_55">p. 55</span>

to agree to it? Then Hellenia stood up and said: The sparrows follow the
sower, and the people their good princes, therefore it becomes you to
begin by rendering yourselves pure, so that you may look within and
without, and not be ashamed of your own conduct. Now, instead of
purifying the people, you have invented foul festivals, in which they
have so long revelled that they wallow like swine in the mire to atone
for your evil passions. The people began to mock and to jeer, so that
she did not dare to pursue the subject; and one would have thought that
they would have called all the people together to drive us out of the
land; but no, in place of abusing her they went all about from the
heathenish Krekaland to the Alps, proclaiming that it had pleased the
Almighty God to send his clever daughter Min-erva, surnamed Nyhellenia,
over the sea in a cloud to give people good counsel, and that all who
listened to her should become rich and happy, and in the end governors
of all the kingdoms of the earth. They erected statues to her on all
their altars, they announced and sold to the simple people advice that
she had never given, and related miracles that she had never performed.
They cunningly made themselves masters of our laws and customs, and by
craft and subtlety were able to explain and spread them around. They
appointed priestesses under their own care, who were apparently under
the protection of Festa <span id="fr_9"></span>[\*](#fn_9.md), our first
Eeremoeder, to watch over the holy lamp; but that lamp they lit
themselves, and instead of imbuing the priestesses with wisdom, and then
sending them to watch the sick and educate the young, they made them
stupid and ignorant, and never allowed them to come out. They were
employed

<span id="page_56">p. 56</span> <span id="page_57">p. 57</span>

as advisers, but the advice which seemed to come from them was but the
repetition of the behests of the priests. When Nyhellenia died, we
wished to choose another mother, and some of us wished to go to Texland
to look for her; but the priests, who were all-powerful among their own
people, would not permit it, and accused us before the people of being
unholy.
