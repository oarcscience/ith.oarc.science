### <span class="smallcaps">From Minno's Writings.</span>

If any one should be so wicked as to commit robbery, murder, arson,
rape, or any other crime, upon a neighbouring state, and our people wish
to inflict punishment, the culprit shall be put to death in the presence

of the offended, in order that no war may arise, and the innocent suffer
for the guilty. If the offended will spare his life and forego their
revenge, it may be permitted. If the culprit should be a king,
Grevetman, or other person in authority, we must make good his fault,
but he must be punished.

If he bears on his shield the honourable name of his forefathers, his
kinsmen shall no longer wear it, in order that every man may look after
the conduct of his relatives.
