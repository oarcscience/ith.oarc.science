### <span class="smallcaps">Useful Extracts from the Writings left by Minno.</span>

Minno <span id="fr_6"></span>[†](#fn_6.md) was an ancient sea-king. He was
a seer and a philosopher, and he gave laws to the Cretans. He was born
at Lindaoord, and after all his wanderings he had the happiness to die
at Lindahem.

If our neighbours have a piece of land or water which it would be
advantageous for us to possess, it is proper that we should offer to buy
it. If they refuse to sell it, we must let them keep it. This is Frya's
Tex, and it would be unjust to act contrary to it.

If any of our neighbours quarrel and fight about any matter except land,
and they request us to arbitrate, our best course will be to decline;
but if

<span id="page_44">p. 44</span> <span id="page_45">p. 45</span>

they insist upon it, it must be done honourably and justly.

If any one comes and says, I am at war, you must help me; or another
comes and says, My son is an infant and incompetent, and I am old, so I
wish you to be his guardian, and to take charge of my property until he
is of age, it is proper to refuse in order that we may not come into
disputes about matters foreign to our free customs.

Whenever a foreign trader comes to the open markets at Wyringen and
Almanland, if he cheats, he must immediately be fined, and it must be
published by the maidens throughout the whole country.

If he should come back, no one must deal with him. He must return as he
came.

Whenever traders are chosen to go to trading stations, or to sail with
the fleets, they must be well known and of good reputation with the
maidens.

If, however, a bad man should by chance be chosen and should try to
cheat, the others are bound to remove him. If he should have committed a
cheat, it must be made good, and the culprit must be banished from the
land in order that our name may be everywhere held in honour.

If we should be ill-treated in a foreign market, whether distant or
near, we must immediately attack them; for though we desire to be at
peace, we must not let our neighbours underrate us or think that we are
afraid.

In my youth I often grumbled at the strictness of the laws, but
afterwards I learned to thank Frya for her Tex and our forefathers for
the laws which they established upon it. Wr-alda or Alvader has given me
many years, and I have travelled over many lands and seas, and after all
that I have seen, I am convinced that we alone

<span id="page_46">p. 46</span> <span id="page_47">p. 47</span>

are chosen by Alvader to have laws. Lyda's people can neither make laws
nor obey them, they are too stupid and uncivilised. Many are like Finda.
They are clever enough, but they are too rapacious, haughty, false,
immoral, and bloodthirsty.

The toad blows himself out, but he can only crawl. The frog cries "Work,
work;" but he can do nothing but hop and make himself ridiculous. The
raven cries "Spare, spare;" but he steals and wastes everything that he
gets into his beak.

Finder's people are just like these. They say a great deal about making
good laws, and every one wishes to make regulations against misconduct,
but does not wish to submit to them himself. Whoever is the most crafty
crows over the others, and tries to make them submit to him, till
another comes who drives him off his perch.

The word "Eva" is too sacred for common use, therefore men have learned
to say "Evin."

"Eva" means that sentiment which is implanted in the breast of every man
in order that he may know what is right and what is wrong, and by which
he is able to judge his own deeds and those of others; that is, if he
has been well and properly brought up. "Eva" has also another meaning;
that is, tranquil, smooth, like water that is not stirred by a breath of
wind. If the water is disturbed it becomes troubled, uneven, but it
always has a tendency to return to its tranquil condition. That is its
nature, just as the inclination towards justice and freedom exists in
Frya's children. We derive this disposition from the spirit of our
father Wr-alda, which speaks strongly in Frya's children, and will
eternally remain so. Eternity is another symbol of Wr-alda, who remains
always just and unchangeable.

Eternal and unalterable are the signs wisdom and rectitude,

<span id="page_48">p. 48</span> <span id="page_49">p. 49</span>

which must be sought after by all pious people, and must be possessed by
all judges. If, therefore, it is desired to make laws and regulations
which shall be permanent, they must be equal for all men. The judges
must pronounce their decisions according to these laws. If any crime is
committed respecting which no law has been made, a general assembly of
the people shall be called, where judgment shall be pronounced in
accordance with the inspiration of Wr-alda's spirit. If we act thus, our
judgment will never fail to be right.

If instead of doing right, men will commit wrong, there will arise
quarrels and differences among people and states. Thence arise civil
wars, and everything is thrown into confusion and destroyed; and, O
foolish people! while you are injuring each other the spiteful Finda's
people with their false priests come and attack your ports, ravish your
daughters, corrupt your morals, and at last throw the bonds of slavery
over every freeman's neck.
