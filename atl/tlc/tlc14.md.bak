### CHAPTER XI

#### AN AFFAIR WITH THE BARBAROUS FISHERS

SO this mighty Empress chose to be jealous of a mere woman prisoner!

Now my mind has been trained to work with a soldierly quickness in these
moments of stress, and I decided on my proper course on the instant the
words had left her lips. I was sacrificing myself for Atlantis by order
of the high council of the priests, and, if needful, Naïs must be
sacrificed also, although in the same flash a scheme came to me for
saving her.

So I bowed gravely before the Empress, and said I, "In this, and in all
other things where a mere human hand is potent, I will carry out your
wishes, Phorenice." And she on her part patted my arm, and fresh waves
of feeling welled up from the depths of her wondrous eyes. Surely the
Gods won for her half her schemes and half her battles when they gave
Phorenice her shape, and her voice, and the matters which lay within the
outlines of her face.

By this time the merchants and the other dwellers adjacent to this part
of the harbor, where the royal quay stands, had come down, offering
changes of raiment and houses to retire into. Phorenice was all
graciousness, and though it was little enough I

<span id="page_182">p. 182</span>

cared for mere wetness of my coat, still that part of the harbor into
which we had been thrown by the mammoth was not over savory, and I was
glad enough to follow her example. For myself, I said no further word to
Naïs, and refrained even from giving her a glance of farewell. But a
small sop like this was no meal for Phorenice, and she gave the
port-captain strict orders for the guarding of his prisoner before she
left him.

At the house into which I was ushered they gave me a bath, and I eased
my host of the plainest garment in his store, and he was pleased enough
at getting off so cheaply. But I had an hour to spend outside on the
pavement listening to the distant din of bombardment before Phorenice
came out to me again, and I could not help feeling some grim amusement
at the face of the merchant who followed. The fellow was clearly ruined.
He had a store of jewels and gauds of the most costly kind, which were
only in fraction his own, seeing that he had bought them (as the custom
is) in partnership with other merchants. These had pleased Phorenice's
eye, and so she had taken all and disposed them on her person.

"Are they not pretty?" said she, showing them to me. "See how they flash
under the sun. I am quite glad now, Deucalion, that the mammoth gave us
that furious ride and that spill, since it has brought me such a bonny
present. You may tell the fellow here that some day, when he has earned
some more, I will come and be his guest again. Ah! they have brought us
litters, I see. Well, send one away and do you share mine with me, sir.
We must

<span id="page_183">p. 183</span>

play at being lovers to-day, even if love is a matter which will come to
us both with more certainty tomorrow. No, do not order more bearers. My
own slaves will carry us handily enough. I am glad you are not one of
your gross, overfed men, Deucalion. I am small and slim myself, and I do
not want to be husbanded by a man who will overshadow me."

"Back to the royal pyramid?" I asked.

"No, nor to the walls. I neither wish to fight nor to sit as Empress
to-day, sir. As I have told you before, it is my whim to be Phorenice,
the maiden, for a few hours, and if some one I wot of would woo me now,
as other maidens are wooed, I should esteem it a luxury. Bid the slaves
carry us round the harbor's rim, and give word to these starers that, if
they follow, I will call down fire upon them as I did upon the
sacrifice."

Now I have seen something of the unruliness of the streets myself, and I
had gathered a hint also from the officer at the gate of the royal
pyramid that night of Phorenice's welcoming banquet. But as whatever
there was in the matter must be common knowledge to the Empress, I did
not bring it to her memory then. So I dismissed the guard which had come
up, and drove away with a few sharp words the throng of gaping
sight-seers who always, silly creatures, must needs come to stare at
their betters; and then I sat in the litter in the place where I was
invited, and the bearers put their heads to the pole.

They swung away with us along the wide pavement which runs between the
houses of the merchants and the mariner folk and the dimpling waters of

<span id="page_184">p. 184</span>

the harbor; and I thought somewhat sadly of the few ships that floated
on that splendid basin now, and of the few evidences of business that
showed themselves on the quays. Time was when the ships were berthed so
close that many had to wait in the estuary outside the walls, and
memorials had been sent to the King that the port should be doubled in
size to hold the glut of trade. And that, too, in the old days of oar
and sail, when machines drawing power from our Lord the Sun were but
rarely used to help a vessel speedily along her course.

The Egypt voyage and a return was a matter of a year then, as against a
brace of months now; and of three ships that set out, one at least could
be reckoned upon succumbing to the dangers of the wide waters and the
terrible beasts that haunt them. But in those old days trade roared with
lusty life, and was ever growing wider and more heavy. Your merchant
then was a portly man and gave generously to the Gods. But now all the
world seemed to be in arms, and, moreover, trade was vulgar. Your
merchant, if he was a man of substance, forgot his merchandise, swore
that chaffering was more indelicate than blasphemy, and curled his beard
after the new fashion, and became a courtier. Where his father had spent
anxious days with cargo tally and shipmaster, the son wasted hours in
directing sewing men as they adorned a coat, and nights in vaporing at
banquets.

Of the smaller merchants who had no substance laid by, taxes and the
constant bickerings of war had wellnigh ground them into starvation.
Besides,

<span id="page_185">p. 185</span>

with the country in constant uproar, there were few markets left for
most merchandise, nor was there aught made now which could be carried
abroad. If your weaver is pressed as a fire-tube man he does not make
cloth, and if your farmer is playing at rebellion, he does not buy
slaves to till his fields. Indeed, they told me that a month before my
return, as fine a cargo of slaves had been brought into harbor as ever
came out of Europe, and there was nothing for it but to set them ashore
across the estuary, and leave them free to starve or live in the wild
ground there as they chose. There was no man in all Atlantis who would
hold so much as one more slave at a gift.

But though I was grieved at this falling away, all schemes for remedy
would be for afterwards. It would only make ill worse to speak of it as
we rode together in the litter. I was growing to know Phorenice's moods
enough for that. Still, I think that she too had studied mine, and did
her best to interest me between her bursts of trifling. We went out to
where the westernmost harbor wall joins the land, and there the panting
bearers set us down. She led me into a little house of stone which stood
by itself, built out on a promontory where there is a constant run of
tide; and when we had been given admittance, after much unbarring, she
showed me her new gold collectors.

In the dry knowledge taught in the colleges and groves of the Sacred
Mountain it had been a common fact to us that the metal gold was present
in a dissolved state in all sea-water, but of plans for dragging

<span id="page_186">p. 186</span>

it forth into yellow hardness none had ever been discussed. But here
this field-reared upstart of an Empress had stumbled upon the trick as
though it had been written in a book.

She patted my arm laughingly as I stared curiously round the place. "I
tell all others in Atlantis that only the Gods have this secret," said
she, "and that They gave it to me as one of Themselves. But I am no
Goddess to you, am I, Deucalion? And, by my face! I have no other
explanation of how this plan was invented. We'll suppose I must have
dreamed it. Look! the sea-water sluices in through that culvert, and
passes over these rough metal plates set in the floor, and then flows
out again yonder in its natural course. You see the yellow metal caught
in the ridges of the plates? That is gold. And my fellows here melt it
with fire into bars, and take it to my smiths in the city. The tides
vary constantly, as you priests know well, as the quiet moon draws them;
and it does not take much figuring to know how much of the sea passes
through these culverts in a month, and how much gold to a grain should
be caught in the plates. My fellows here at first thought to cheat me,
but I towed two of them in the water once behind a galley till the
cannibal fish ate them, and since then the others have given me credit
for—for what do you think?"

"More divinity."

"I suppose it is that. But I am letting you see how it is done. Just
have the head to work out a little sum, and see what an effect can be
gained. You will be a God yet yourself, Deucalion, with these

<span id="page_187">p. 187</span>

silly Atlanteans, if only you will use your wit and cleverness."

Was she laughing at me? Was she in earnest? I could not tell. Sometimes
she pointed out that her success and triumphs were merely the reward of
thought and brilliancy, and next moment she gave me some impossible
explanation and left me to deduce that she must be more than mortal or
the thing could never have been found. In good truth, this little woman
with her supple mind and her supple body mystified me more and more the
longer I stayed by her side; and more and more despairing did I grow
that Atlantis could ever be restored by my agency to peace and the
ancient Gods, even after I had carried out the commands of the high
council and taken her to wife.

Only one plan seemed humanly possible, and that was to curb her further
mischievousness by death, and then leave the wretched country naturally
to recover. It was just a dagger-stroke, and the thing was done. Yet the
very idea of this revolted me, and when the desperate thought came to my
mind (which it did ever and anon), I hugged to myself the answer that if
it were fitting to do this thing, the High Gods in Their infinite wisdom
would surely have put definite commands upon me for its carrying out.

Yet such was the fascination of Phorenice that, when presently we left
her gold collectors and stumbled into such peril that a little
withholding of my hand would have gained her a passage to the nether
Gods, I found myself fighting when she called upon

<span id="page_188">p. 188</span>

me as seldom I have fought before. And though, of course, some blame for
this must be laid upon that lust of battle which thrills even the
coldest of us when blows begin to whistle and war-cries start to ring,
there is no doubt also that the pleasure of protecting Phorenice, and
the distaste for seeing her pulled down by those rude, uncouth fishers,
put special nerve and vehemence into my blows.

The cause of the matter was the unrest and the prevalency to street
violence which I have spoken of above, and the desperate poverty of the
common people, which led them to take any risk if it showed them a
chance of winning the wherewithal to purchase a meal. We had once more
mounted the litter, and once more the bearers, with their heads beneath
the pole, bore us on at their accustomed swinging trot. Phorenice was
telling me about her new supplies of gold. She had made fresh sumptuary
laws, it appeared.

"In the old days," said she, "when yellow gold was tediously dredged up
grain by grain from river gravels in the dangerous lands, a quillful
would cost a rich man's savings, and so none but those whose high
station fitted them to be so adorned could wear golden ornaments. But
when the sea-water gave me gold here by the double handful a day, I
found that the price of these river hoards decreased; and one day—could
you credit it?—a common fellow, who was one of my smiths, came to me
wearing a collar of yellow gold on his own common neck. Well, I had that
neck divided as payment for his presumption; and as I promised to repeat
the division promptly on

<span id="page_189">p. 189</span>

all other offenders, that special species of forwardness seems to be
checked for the time. There are many exasperations, Deucalion, in
governing these common people."

She had other things to say upon the matter, but at this point I saw two
clumsy boats of fishers paddling to us from over the ripples, and at the
same time among the narrow lanes which led between the houses on the
other side of us savage-faced men were beginning to run after the litter
in threatening clusters.

"With permission," I said, "I will step out of the conveyance and
scatter this rabble."

"Oh, the people always cluster round me. Poor ugly souls, they seem to
take a strange delight in coming to stare at my pretty looks. But
scatter them. I have said I did not wish to be followed. I am taking
holiday now, Deucalion, am I not, while you learn to woo me?"

I stepped to the ground. The rough fishers in the boats were beginning
to shout to those who dodged among the houses to see to it that we did
not escape, and the numbers who hemmed us in on the shore side were
increasing every moment. The prospect was unpleasant enough. We had come
out beyond the merchants’ quarter, and were level with those small huts
of mud and grass which the fishing population deem sufficient for
shelter, and which has always been a spot where turbulence might be
expected. Indeed, even in those days of peace and good government in the
old King's time, this part of the city had rarely been without its
weekly riot.

<span id="page_190">p. 190</span>

The life of the fishermen is the most hard that any human toilers have
to endure. Violence from the winds and waves, and pelting from
fire-stones out of the sky are their daily portion; the great beasts
that dwell in the seas hunt them with savage persistence, and it is a
rare day when at least some one of the fishers’ guild fails to come home
to answer the tally. Moreover, the manner which prevails of catching
fish is not without its risks.

To each man there is a large sea-fowl taken as a nestling and trained to
the work. A ring of bronze is round its neck to prevent its swallowing
the spoil for which it dives, and for each fish it takes and flies back
with to the boat, the head and tail and inwards are given to it for a
reward, the ring being removed while it makes the meal.

The birds are faithful, once they have got a training, and are seldom
known to desert their owners; but, although the fishers treat them more
kindly than they do their wives, or children of their own begetting, the
life of the birds is precarious like that of their masters. The larger
beasts and fish of the sea prey on them as they prey on the smaller
fish; and so, whatever care may be lavished upon them, they are most
liable to sudden cutting off.

And here is another thing that makes the life of the fisher most
precarious: if his fishing-bird be slain, and the second, which he has
in training, also come by ill fortune, he is left suddenly bereft of all
utensils of livelihood, and (for aught his guild-fellows care) he may go
starve. For these fishers hold that the Gods of the sea regulate their
craft, and that if one

<span id="page_191">p. 191</span>

is not pleasing to Them, They rob him of his birds; after which it would
be impious to have any truck or dealing with such a fellow; and
accordingly he is left to starve or rob as he chooses.

All of which circumstances tend to make the fishers rude, desperate men,
who have been forced into the trade because all other callings have
rejected them. They are fellows, moreover, who will spend the gains of a
month on a night's debauch, for fear that the morrow will rob them of
life and the chance of spending; and, moreover, it is their one point of
honor to be curbed in no desire by an ordinary fear of consequences. As
will appear.

I went quickly towards the largest knot of these people, who were
skulking behind the houses, leaving the litter halted in the path behind
me, and I bade them sharply enough to disperse. "For an employment," I
added, "put your houses in order, and clean the fish offal from the
lanes between them. Tomorrow I will come round here to inspect, and put
this quarter into a better order. But for to-day the Empress, (whose
name be adored) wishes for a privacy; so cease your staring."

"Then give us money," said a shrill voice from among the huts.

"I will send you a torch in an hour's time," I said, grimly, "and rig
you a gallows, if you give me more annoyance. To your kennels, you!"

I think they would have obeyed the voice of authority if they had been
left to themselves. There was a quick stir among them. Those that stood
in the sunlight instinctively slipped into the shadow,

<span id="page_192">p. 192</span>

and many dodged into the houses and cowered in dark corners out of
sight. But the men in the two hide-covered fisher-boats that were
paddling up called them back with boisterous cries.

I signed to the litter-bearers to move on quickly along their road.
There was need of discipline here, and I was minded to deal it out
myself with a firm hand. I judged that I could prevent them following
the Empress, but if she still remained as a glittering bait for them to
rob, and I had to protect her also, it might be that my work would not
be done so effectively.

But it seems I was presumptuous in giving an order which dealt with the
person of Phorenice. She bade the bearers stand where they were, and
stepped out, and drew her weapons from beneath the cushions. She came
towards me strapping a sword on to her hip, and carrying a well-dinted
target of gold on her left forearm. "An unfair trick," cried she,
laughing. "If you will keep a fight to yourself now, Deucalion, where
will your greediness carry you when I am your shrinking, wistful little
wife? Are these fools truly going to stand up against us?"

I was not coveting a fight, but it seemed as if there would be no
avoidance of it now. The robe and the glittering gauds of which
Phorenice had recently despoiled the merchant drew the eyes of these
people with keen attraction. The fishers in the boats paddled into the
surf which edged the beach, and leaped over-side and left the frail
basket-work structures to be spewed up sound or smashed, as chance
ordered. And from the houses, and from the filthy

<span id="page_193">p. 193</span>

lanes between them, poured out hordes of others, women mixed with the
men, gathering round us threateningly.

"Have a care," shouted one on the outskirts of the crowd. "She called
down fire for the sacrifice once to-day, and she can burn up others here
if she chooses."

"So much the more for those that are left," retorted another. "She
cannot burn all."

"Nay, I will not burn any," said Phorenice, "but you shall look upon my
sword play till you are tired."

I heard her say that with some malicious amusement, knowing (as one of
the Seven) how she had called down the fires of the sky to burn that
cloven-hoofed horse offered in sacrifice, and knowing too, full well,
that she could bring down no fire here. But they gave us little enough
time for wordy courtesies. Their Empress never went far unattended, and,
for aught the wretches knew, an escort might be close behind. So what
pilfering they did it behooved them to get done quickly.

They closed in; jostling one another to be first, and the reek of their
filthy bodies made us cough. A grimy hand launched out to seize some of
the jewels which flashed on Phorenice's breast, and I lopped it off at
the elbow, so that it fell at her feet, and a second later we were
engaged.

"Your back to mine, comrade," cried she, with a laugh, and then drew and
laid about her with a fine dexterity. Bah! but it was mere slaughter,
that first bout.

<span id="page_194">p. 194</span>

The crowd hustled inward with such greediness to seize what they could
that none had space to draw back elbow for a thrust, and we too kept a
circle round us by sheer whirling of steel. It is necessary to do one's
work cleanly in these bouts, as wounded left on the ground unnoticed
before one are as dangerous as so many snakes. But as we circled round
in our battling I noted that all of Phorenice's quarry lay peaceful and
still. By the Gods! but she could play a fine sword, this dainty
Empress. She touched life with every thrust.

Yes, it was plain to see, now an example was given, that the throne of
Atlantis had been won, not by a lovely face and a subtle tongue alone;
and (as a fighter myself) I did not like Phorenice the less for the
knowledge. I could but see her out of the corner of my eye, and that
only now and again, for the fishers, despite their ill-knowledge of
fence and the clumsiness of their weapons, had heavy numbers and most
savage ferocity; and as they made so confident of being able to pull us
down, it required more than a little hard battling to keep them from
doing it. Aye, by the Gods! it was at times a fight my heart warmed to;
and if I had not contrived to pluck a shield from one fool who came too
vaingloriously near me with one, I could not swear they would not have
dragged me down by sheer ravening savageness.

And always above the burly uproar of the fight came very pleasantly to
my ears Phorenice's cry of "Deucalion!" which she chose as her battle
shout. I knew her, of course, to be a past mistress of the art

<span id="img_19400"></span> <span align="CENTER"> [![“‘WE TWO KEPT A
CIRCLE, AROUND US’”](tn/19400.jpg)

“‘WE TWO KEPT A CIRCLE, AROUND US’”  
</span>

<span id="page_195">p. 195</span>

of compliment, and it was no new thing for me to hear the name roared
out above a battle din; but it was given there under circumstances which
were peculiar, and for the life of me I could not help being tickled by
the flattery.

Condemn my weakness how you will, but I came very near then to liking
the Empress of Atlantis in the way she wished. And as for that other
woman who should have filled my mind, I will confess that the stress of
the moment and the fury of the engagement had driven both her and her
strait completely out beyond the marches of my memory. Of such frail
stuff are we made, even those of us who esteem ourselves the strongest.

Now it is a temptation few men born to the sword can resist, to throw
themselves heart and soul into a fight for a fight's sake, and it seems
that women can be bitten with the same fierce infection. The attack
slackened and halted. We stood in the middle of a ring of twisted dead,
and the rest of the fishers and their women who hemmed us in shrank back
out of reach of our weapons.

It was the moment for a truce, the moment when a few strong words would
have sent them back cowering to their huts, and given us free passage to
go where we chose. But no; this Phorenice must needs sing a hymn to her
sword and mine, gloating over our feats and invulnerability; and then
she must needs ask payment for the bearers of her litter whom they had
killed, and then speak balefully of the burnings and the skinnings and
the sawings asunder with which this fishers' quarter would be treated in

<span id="page_196">p. 196</span>

the near future, till they learned the virtues of deportment and genteel
manners.

"It makes your backs creep, does it?" said Phorenice. "I do not wonder.
This severity must have its unpleasant side. But why do you not put it
beyond my power to give the order? Either you must think yourselves Gods
or me no Goddess, or you would not have gone on so far. Come, now, you
nasty-smelling people, follow out your theory, and if you make a good
fight of it, I swear by my face I will be lenient with those who do not
fall."

But there was no pressing up to meet our swords. They still ringed us
in, savage and sullen, beyond the ring of their own dead, and would
neither run back to the houses nor give us the game of further fight.
There was a certain stubborn bravery about them that one could not but
admire, and for myself I determined that next time it became my duty to
raise troops I would catch a handful of these men and teach them
handiness with the utensils of war and train them to loyalty and
faithfulness. But presently from behind their ranks a stone flew, and
though it whizzed between the Empress and myself, and struck down a
fisher, it showed that they had brought a new method into their attack,
and it behooved us to take thought and meet it.

I looked round me up and down the beach. There was no sign of a rescue.
"Phorenice," I said, in the court tongue, which these barbarous fishers
would know little enough of, "I take it that a whiff of the sea-breeze
would come very pleasant after all this warm play. As you can show such
pretty sword-work,

<span id="page_197">p. 197</span>

will you cut me a way down to the beach, and I will do my poor best to
keep these creatures from snapping at our heels?"

"Oh!" cried she, "then I am to have a courtier for a husband, after all.
Why have you kept back your flattering speeches till now? Is that your
trick to make me love you?"

"I will think out the reason for it another time."

"Ah, these stern, commanding husbands," said she, "how they do press
upon their little wives!" and with that leaped over the ring of dead
before her, and cut and stabbed a way through those that stood between
her and the waters which creamed and crashed upon the beach. Gods! what
a charge she made. It made me tingle with admiration as I followed
sideways behind her, guarding the rear. And I am a man that has spent so
many years in battlings that it takes something far out of the common to
move me to any enthusiasm in this matter.

There were two boats creaking and washing about in the edge of the surf,
but in one, happily, the wicker-work which made its frame was crushed by
the weight of the waves into a shapeless bundle of sticks, and would
take half a day to replace. So that, let us but get the other craft
afloat, and we should be free from further embroiling. But the fishers
were quick to see the object of this new manœuvre. "Guard the boat!"
they shouted. "Smash her! Slit her skin with your knives! Tear her with
your fingers! Swim her out to sea! Oh, at least take the paddles!"

But if these clumsy fishers could run, Phorenice

<span id="page_198">p. 198</span>

was like a legged snake for speed. She was down beside the boat before
any could reach it, laughing and shouting out that she could beat them
at every point. Myself, I was slower bf foot; and, besides, there were
some that offered me a fight on the road, and I was not wishful to balk
them; and, moreover, the fewer we left clamoring behind, the fewer there
would be to speed our going with their stones. Still, I came to the
beach in good order, and laid hands on the flimsy boat and tipped her
dry.

"Fighting is no trade for me," I cried, "while you are here, Phorenice.
Guard me my back and walk out into the water."

I took the boat, thrusting it afloat and wading with it till two lines
of the surf were past. The fishers swarmed round us, active as fish in
their native element, and strove mightily to get hands on the boat and
slit the hides which covered it with their eager fingers. But I had a
spare hand and a short stabbing-knife for such close-quarter work, and
here, there, and everywhere was Phorenice the Empress, with her thirsty,
dripping sword. By the Gods! I laughed with sheer delight at seeing her
art of fence.

But the swirl of a great fish into the shallows, and the squeal of a
fisher as he was dragged down and borne away into the deep, made me
mindful of foes that no skill can conquer and no bravery avoid. Without
taking time to give the Empress a word of warning, I stooped and flung
an arm round her, and threw her up out of the water into the boat, and
then thrust on with all my might, driving the flimsy craft out to sea,
while my legs crept under me for

<span id="page_199">p. 199</span>

fear of the beasts which swam invisible beneath the muddied waters.

To the fishers, inured to these horrid perils by daily association, the
seizing of one of their number meant little, and they pressed on,
careless of their dull lives, eager only to snatch the jewels which
still flaunted on Phorenice's breast. Of the vengeance that might come
after they reeked nothing; let them but get the wherewithal for one
night's good debauch, and they would forget that such a thing as the
morning of a morrow could have existence.

Two fellows I caught and killed, that, diving down beneath, tried to
slit the skin of the boat out of sight under the water; and Phorenice
cared for all those that tried to put a hand on the gunwales. Yes, and
she did more than that. A huge long-necked turtle that was stirred out
of the mud by the turmoil came up to daylight, and swung its great
horn-lipped mouth to this side and that, seeking for a prey. The fishers
near it dodged and dived. I, thrusting at the stern of the boat, could
only hope it would pass me by, and so offered an easy mark. It scurried
towards me, champing its noisy lips, and beating the water into spray
with its flippers.

But Phorenice was quick with a remedy and a rescue. She passed her sword
through one of the fishers that pressed her, and then thrust the body
towards the turtle. The great neck swooped towards it; the long slimy
feelers which protruded from its head quivered and snuffled; and then
the horny green jaws crunched on it, and drew it down out of sight.

The boat was in deep water now, and Phorenice

<span id="page_200">p. 200</span>

called upon me to come in over the side, she the while balancing nicely
so that the flimsy thing should not be overset. The fishers had given up
their pursuit, finding that they earned nothing but lopped off arms and
split faces by coming within swing of this terrible sword of their
Empress, and so contented themselves with volleying jagged stones in the

them did damage, and we drew quickly out of their range.
