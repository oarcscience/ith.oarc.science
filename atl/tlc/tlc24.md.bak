The following advertisements ***from 1900*** appeared in the original
book. They are included for completeness.—JBH.

#### BY H. G. WELLS

WHEN THE SLEEPER WAKES. Illustrated. Post 8vo, Cloth, Ornamental, $1 50.

<span class="small">"This romance of the twenty-second century," as the
London *Daily Telegraph* says, "will prove absolutely enthralling. The
hero goes into a trance in 1900, and when he awakes two centuries later
he finds that his property has increased so greatly that he owns more
than half the world."</span>

THIRTY STRANGE STORIES. New Edition. Post 8vo, Cloth, Ornamental, $1 50.

<span class="small">Creepy, ingenious, original, and more than clever
they all are. They fascinate you like the eye of a snake. . . . It would
be impossible to find a group of stories that will give the reader more
sensations, or hold his attention more firmly .—*Boston Herald*.</span>

THE WAR OF THE WORLDS. With Illustrations. Post 8vo, Cloth, Ornamental,
$1 50.

<span class="small">One of the conspicuous books of the year, from its
striking originality of title and plot.—Washington Times.</span>

THE INVISIBLE MAN. A Grotesque Romance. Post 8vo, Cloth, Ornamental, $1
00.

<span class="small">In his audacious imaginative insight into the
romantic possibilities underlying the discoveries or the suggestion of
modern science Mr. Wells stands unrivalled. . . . It is just like a
transcript from real life, recalling the best work of Poe in its accent
of sincerity and surpassing it in its felicity of style.—*The
Spectator*, London.</span>

#### BY JAMES M. LUDLOW

A KING OF TYRE. A Tale of the Times of Ezra and Nehemiah. 16mo, Cloth,
Ornamental, $1 00.

Another distinct success in the field of historical fiction. . . . Must
be unhesitatingly set down as a highly satisfactory performance.—*Boston
Beacon*.

It is altogether a fresh and enjoyable tale, strong in its situations
and stirring in its actions.—*Cincinnati Commercial-Gazette*.

The picture of the life and manners of that far-away period is carefully
and artistically drawn, the plot is full of interest, and the whole
treatment of the subject is strikingly original, and there is a dramatic
intensity in the story which will at once remind the reader of
"Ben-Hur."—*Boston Traveller*.

THE CAPTAIN OF THE JANIZARIES. A Tale of the Times of Scanderbeg and the
Fall of Constantinople. 16mo, Cloth, Ornamental, $1 50; 8vo, Paper, 50
cents.

Strong in its central historical character, abounding in incident, rapid
and stirring in action, animated and often brilliant in
style.—*Christian Union*, N. Y.

Something new and striking interests us in almost every chapter. The
peasantry of the Balkans, the training and government of the Janizaries,
the interior of Christian and Moslem camps, the horrors of raids and
battles, the violence of the Sultan, the tricks of spies, the exploits
of heroes, engage Mr. Ludlow's fluent pen.—*N. Y. Tribune*.

THAT ANGELIC WOMAN. A Novel. 16mo, Cloth, Ornamental, $1 00.

The plot is skilfully drawn, the whole story shows dramatic power, and
the conclusion will satisfy those readers who prefer a happy ending of
an exciting tale.—*Observer*, N.Y.

A capital little story. . . . It will take but a couple of hours to read
it, and there is no one who will not be all the better for its wholesome
lessons.—*N. Y. Journal of Commerce*.

A charming little story, the delightful companion of the busy reader's
leisure hour.—*Evangelist*. N. Y.
