### Basic English Bible: 1 Corinthians

<span id="an_1:1">1:1</span> Paul, an Apostle of Jesus Christ by the
purpose of God, and Sosthenes the brother,

<span id="an_1:2">1:2</span> To the church of God which is in Corinth,
to those who have been made holy in Christ Jesus, saints by the
selection of God, with all those who in every place give honour to the
name of our Lord Jesus Christ, their Lord and ours:

<span id="an_1:3">1:3</span> Grace to you and peace from God our Father
and the Lord Jesus Christ.

<span id="an_1:4">1:4</span> I give praise to my God for you at all
times, because of the grace of God which has been given to you in Christ
Jesus;

<span id="an_1:5">1:5</span> So that in him you have wealth in all
things, in word and in knowledge of every sort;

<span id="an_1:6">1:6</span> Even as the witness of the Christ has been
made certain among you:

<span id="an_1:7">1:7</span> So that having every grace you are living
in the hope of the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ;

<span id="an_1:8">1:8</span> Who will give you strength to the end, to
be free from all sin in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.

<span id="an_1:9">1:9</span> God is true, through whom you have been
given a part with his Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.

<span id="an_1:10">1:10</span> Now I make request to you, my brothers,
in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you will all say the same
thing, and that there may be no divisions among you, so that you may be
in complete agreement, in the same mind and in the same opinion.

<span id="an_1:11">1:11</span> Because it has come to my knowledge,
through those of the house of Chloe, that there are divisions among you,
my brothers.

<span id="an_1:12">1:12</span> That is, that some of you say, I am of
Paul; some say, I am of Apollos; some say, I am of Cephas; and some say,
I am Christ's.

<span id="an_1:13">1:13</span> Is there a division in Christ? was Paul
nailed to the cross for you? or were you given baptism in the name of
Paul?

<span id="an_1:14">1:14</span> I give praise to God that not one of you
had baptism from me, but Crispus and Gaius;

<span id="an_1:15">1:15</span> So that no one may be able to say that
you had baptism in my name.

<span id="an_1:16">1:16</span> And I gave baptism to the house of
Stephanas; but I am not certain that any others had baptism from me.

<span id="an_1:17">1:17</span> For Christ sent me, not to give baptism,
but to be a preacher of the good news: not with wise words, for fear
that the cross of Christ might be made of no value.

<span id="an_1:18">1:18</span> For the word of the cross seems foolish
to those who are on the way to destruction; but to us who are on the way
to salvation it is the power of God.

<span id="an_1:19">1:19</span> As it says in the holy Writings, I will
put an end to the wisdom of the wise, and will put on one side the
designs of those who have knowledge.

<span id="an_1:20">1:20</span> Where is the wise? where is he who has
knowledge of the law? where is the man of this world who has a love of
discussion? has not God made foolish the wisdom of this world?

<span id="an_1:21">1:21</span> For because, by the purpose of God, the
world, with all its wisdom, had not the knowledge of God, it was God's
pleasure, by so foolish a thing as preaching, to give salvation to those
who had faith in him.

<span id="an_1:22">1:22</span> Seeing that the Jews make request for
signs, and the Greeks are looking for knowledge:

<span id="an_1:23">1:23</span> But we give the good news of Christ on
the cross, a hard thing to the Jews, and a foolish thing to the
Gentiles;

<span id="an_1:24">1:24</span> But to those of God's selection, Jews and
Greeks, Christ is the power and the wisdom of God.

<span id="an_1:25">1:25</span> Because what seems foolish in God is
wiser than men; and what seems feeble in God is stronger than men.

<span id="an_1:26">1:26</span> For you see God's design for you, my
brothers, that he has not taken a great number of the wise after the
flesh, not the strong, not the noble:

<span id="an_1:27">1:27</span> But God made selection of the foolish
things of this world so that he might put the wise to shame; and the
feeble things that he might put to shame the strong;

<span id="an_1:28">1:28</span> And the low things of the world, and the
things without honour, did God make selection of, yes, even the things
which are not, so that he might make as nothing the things which are:

<span id="an_1:29">1:29</span> So that no flesh might have glory before
God.

<span id="an_1:30">1:30</span> But God has given you a place in Christ
Jesus, through whom God has given us wisdom and righteousness and
salvation, and made us holy:

<span id="an_1:31">1:31</span> So that, as it is said in the holy
Writings, Whoever has a desire for glory, let his glory be in the Lord.

<span id="an_2:1">2:1</span> And when I came to you, my brothers, I did
not come with wise words of knowledge, putting before you the secret of
God.

<span id="an_2:2">2:2</span> For I had made the decision to have
knowledge of nothing among you but only of Jesus Christ on the cross.

<span id="an_2:3">2:3</span> And I was with you without strength, in
fear and in doubt.

<span id="an_2:4">2:4</span> And in my preaching there were no honeyed
words of wisdom, but I was dependent on the power of the Spirit to make
it clear to you:

<span id="an_2:5">2:5</span> So that your faith might be based not on
man's wisdom but on the power of God.

<span id="an_2:6">2:6</span> But still we have wisdom for those who are
complete in knowledge, though not the wisdom of this world, and not of
the rulers of this world, who are coming to nothing:

<span id="an_2:7">2:7</span> But we give the news of the secret wisdom
of God, which he had kept in store before the world came into existence,
for our glory;

<span id="an_2:8">2:8</span> Of which not one of the rulers of this
world had knowledge: for if they had, they would not have put the Lord
of glory on the cross:

<span id="an_2:9">2:9</span> But as it says in the holy Writings, Things
which the eye saw not, and which had not come to the ears or into the
heart of man, such things as God has made ready for those who have love
for him.

<span id="an_2:10">2:10</span> But God has given us the revelation of
these things through his Spirit, for the Spirit makes search into all
things, even the deep things of God.

<span id="an_2:11">2:11</span> For who has knowledge of the things of a
man but the spirit of the man which is in him? in the same way, no one
has knowledge of the things of God but the Spirit of God.

<span id="an_2:12">2:12</span> But we have not the spirit of the world,
but the Spirit which comes from God, so that we may have knowledge of
the things which are freely given to us by God.

<span id="an_2:13">2:13</span> And these are the things which we say,
not in the language of man's wisdom, but in words given to us by the
Spirit, judging the things of the spirit by the help of the Spirit.

<span id="an_2:14">2:14</span> For the natural man is not able to take
in the things of the Spirit of God: for they seem foolish to him, and he
is not able to have knowledge of them, because such knowledge comes only
through the Spirit.

<span id="an_2:15">2:15</span> But he who has the Spirit, though judging
all things, is himself judged by no one.

<span id="an_2:16">2:16</span> For who has knowledge of the mind of the
Lord, so as to be his teacher? But we have the mind of Christ.

<span id="an_3:1">3:1</span> And the teaching I gave you, my brothers,
was such as I was able to give, not to those who have the Spirit, but to
those who are still in the flesh, even to children in Christ.

<span id="an_3:2">3:2</span> I gave you milk and not meat, because you
were, then, unable to take it, and even now you are not able;

<span id="an_3:3">3:3</span> Because you are still in the flesh: for
when there is envy and division among you, are you not still walking
after the way of the flesh, even as natural men?

<span id="an_3:4">3:4</span> For when one says, I am of Paul; and
another says, I am of Apollos; are you not talking like natural men?

<span id="an_3:5">3:5</span> What then is Apollos? and what is Paul?
They are but servants who gave you the good news as God gave it to them.

<span id="an_3:6">3:6</span> I did the planting, Apollos did the
watering, but God gave the increase.

<span id="an_3:7">3:7</span> So then the planter is nothing, and the
waterer is nothing; but God who gives the increase.

<span id="an_3:8">3:8</span> Now the planter and the waterer are working
for the same end: but they will have their separate rewards in the
measure of their work.

<span id="an_3:9">3:9</span> For we are workers with God: you are God's
planting, God's building.

<span id="an_3:10">3:10</span> In the measure of the grace given to me,
I, as a wise master-builder, have put the base in position, and another
goes on building on it. But let every man take care what he puts on it.

<span id="an_3:11">3:11</span> For there is no other base for the
building but that which has been put down, which is Jesus Christ.

<span id="an_3:12">3:12</span> But on the base a man may put gold,
silver, stones of great price, wood, dry grass, cut stems;

<span id="an_3:13">3:13</span> Every man's work will be made clear in
that day, because it will be tested by fire; and the fire itself will
make clear the quality of every man's work.

<span id="an_3:14">3:14</span> If any man's work comes through the test,
he will have a reward.

<span id="an_3:15">3:15</span> If the fire puts an end to any man's
work, it will be his loss: but he will get salvation himself, though as
by fire.

<span id="an_3:16">3:16</span> Do you not see that you are God's holy
house, and that the Spirit of God has his place in you?

<span id="an_3:17">3:17</span> If anyone makes the house of God unclean,
God will put an end to him; for the house of God is holy, and you are
his house.

<span id="an_3:18">3:18</span> Let no man have a false idea. If any man
seems to himself to be wise among you, let him become foolish, so that
he may be wise.

<span id="an_3:19">3:19</span> For the wisdom of this world is foolish
before God. As it is said in the holy Writings, He who takes the wise in
their secret designs:

<span id="an_3:20">3:20</span> And again, The Lord has knowledge of the
reasonings of the wise, that they are nothing.

<span id="an_3:21">3:21</span> So let no one take pride in men. For all
things are yours;

<span id="an_3:22">3:22</span> Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the
world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all are
yours;

<span id="an_3:23">3:23</span> And you are Christ's; and Christ is
God's.

<span id="an_4:1">4:1</span> Let us be judged as servants of Christ, and
as those who are responsible for the secret things of God.

<span id="an_4:2">4:2</span> And it is right for such servants to be
safe persons.

<span id="an_4:3">4:3</span> But it is a small thing to me that I am
judged by you or by man's judging; I am not even a judge of myself.

<span id="an_4:4">4:4</span> For I am not conscious of any wrong in
myself; but this does not make me clear, for it is the Lord who is my
judge.

<span id="an_4:5">4:5</span> For this reason let there be no judging
before the time, till the Lord comes, who will make clear the secret
things of the dark, and the designs of the heart; and then will every
man have his praise from God.

<span id="an_4:6">4:6</span> My brothers, it is because of you that I
have taken Apollos and myself as examples of these things, so that in us
you might see that it is not wise to go farther than what is in the holy
Writings, so that no one of you may be lifted up against his brother.

<span id="an_4:7">4:7</span> For who made you better than your brother?
or what have you that has not been given to you? but if it has been
given to you, what cause have you for pride, as if it had not been given
to you?

<span id="an_4:8">4:8</span> For even now you are full, even now you
have wealth, you have been made kings without us: truly, I would be glad
if you were kings, so that we might be kings with you.

<span id="an_4:9">4:9</span> For it seems to me that God has put us the
Apostles last of all, as men whose fate is death: for we are put on view
to the world, and to angels, and to men.

<span id="an_4:10">4:10</span> We are made to seem foolish for Christ,
but you are wise in Christ; we are feeble, but you are strong; you have
glory, but we have shame.

<span id="an_4:11">4:11</span> Even to this hour we are without food,
drink, and clothing, we are given blows and have no certain
resting-place;

<span id="an_4:12">4:12</span> And with our hands we do the hardest
work: when they give us curses we give blessings, when we undergo
punishment we take it quietly;

<span id="an_4:13">4:13</span> When evil things are said about us we
give gentle answers: we are made as the unclean things of the world, as
that for which no one has any use, even till now.

<span id="an_4:14">4:14</span> I am not saying these things to put you
to shame, but so that, as my dear children, you may see what is right.

<span id="an_4:15">4:15</span> For even if you had ten thousand teachers
in Christ, you have not more than one father: for in Christ Jesus I have
given birth to you through the good news.

<span id="an_4:16">4:16</span> So my desire is that you take me as your
example.

<span id="an_4:17">4:17</span> For this cause I have sent Timothy to
you, who is my dear and true child in the Lord; he will make clear to
you my ways in Christ, even as I am teaching everywhere in every church.

<span id="an_4:18">4:18</span> Now some are full of pride, as if I was
not coming to you.

<span id="an_4:19">4:19</span> But I will come to you in a short time,
if it is pleasing to the Lord, and I will take note, not of the word of
those who are full of pride, but of the power.

<span id="an_4:20">4:20</span> For the kingdom of God is not in word but
in power.

<span id="an_4:21">4:21</span> What is your desire? is my coming to be
with punishment, or is it to be in love and a gentle spirit?

<span id="an_5:1">5:1</span> It is said, in fact, that there is among
you a sin of the flesh, such as is not seen even among the Gentiles,
that one of you has his father's wife.

<span id="an_5:2">5:2</span> And in place of feeling sorrow, you are
pleased with yourselves, so that he who has done this thing has not been
sent away from among you.

<span id="an_5:3">5:3</span> For I myself, being present in spirit
though not in body, have come to a decision about him who has done this
thing;

<span id="an_5:4">5:4</span> In the name of our Lord Jesus, when you
have come together with my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus,

<span id="an_5:5">5:5</span> That this man is to be handed over to Satan
for the destruction of the flesh, so that his spirit may have
forgiveness in the day of the Lord Jesus.

<span id="an_5:6">5:6</span> This pride of yours is not good. Do you not
see that a little leaven makes a change in all the mass?

<span id="an_5:7">5:7</span> Take away, then, the old leaven, so that
you may be a new mass, even as you are without leaven. For Christ has
been put to death as our Passover.

<span id="an_5:8">5:8</span> Let us then keep the feast, not with old
leaven, and not with the leaven of evil thoughts and acts, but with the
unleavened bread of true thoughts and right feelings.

<span id="an_5:9">5:9</span> In my letter I said to you that you were
not to keep company with those who go after the desires of the flesh;

<span id="an_5:10">5:10</span> But I had not in mind the sinners who are
outside the church, or those who have a desire for and take the property
of others, or those who give worship to images; for it is not possible
to keep away from such people without going out of the world completely:

<span id="an_5:11">5:11</span> But the sense of my letter was that if a
brother had the name of being one who went after the desires of the
flesh, or had the desire for other people's property, or was in the way
of using violent language, or being the worse for drink, or took by
force what was not his, you might not keep company with such a one, or
take food with him.

<span id="an_5:12">5:12</span> For it is no business of mine to be
judging those who are outside; but it is yours to be judging those who
are among you;

<span id="an_5:13">5:13</span> As for those who are outside, God is
their judge. So put away the evil man from among you.

<span id="an_6:1">6:1</span> How is it, that if any one of you has a
cause at law against another, he takes it before a Gentile judge and not
before the saints?

<span id="an_6:2">6:2</span> Is it not certain that the saints will be
the judges of the world? if then the world will be judged by you, are
you unable to give a decision about the smallest things?

<span id="an_6:3">6:3</span> Is it not certain that we are to be the
judges of angels? how much more then of the things of this life?

<span id="an_6:4">6:4</span> If then there are questions to be judged in
connection with the things of this life, why do you put them in the
hands of those who have no position in the church?

<span id="an_6:5">6:5</span> I say this to put you to shame. Is there
not among you one wise man who may be able to give a decision between
his brothers?

<span id="an_6:6">6:6</span> But a brother who has a cause at law
against another takes it before Gentile judges.

<span id="an_6:7">6:7</span> More than this, it is not to your credit to
have causes at law with one another at all. Why not put up with wrong?
why not undergo loss?

<span id="an_6:8">6:8</span> So far from doing this, you yourselves do
wrong and take your brothers' property.

<span id="an_6:9">6:9</span> Have you not knowledge that evil-doers will
have no part in the kingdom of God? Have no false ideas about this: no
one who goes after the desires of the flesh, or gives worship to images,
or is untrue when married, or is less than a man, or makes a wrong use
of men,

<span id="an_6:10">6:10</span> Or is a thief, or the worse for drink, or
makes use of strong language, or takes by force what is not his, will
have any part in the kingdom of God.

<span id="an_6:11">6:11</span> And such were some of you; but you have
been washed, you have been made holy, you have been given righteousness
in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and in the Spirit of our God.

<span id="an_6:12">6:12</span> I am free to do all things; but not all
things are wise. I am free to do all things; but I will not let myself
come under the power of any.

<span id="an_6:13">6:13</span> Food is for the stomach and the stomach
for food, and God will put an end to them together. But the body is not
for the desires of the flesh, but for the Lord; and the Lord for the
body:

<span id="an_6:14">6:14</span> And God who made the Lord Jesus come back
from the dead will do the same for us by his power.

<span id="an_6:15">6:15</span> Do you not see that your bodies are part
of the body of Christ? how then may I take what is a part of the body of
Christ and make it a part of the body of a loose woman? such a thing may
not be.

<span id="an_6:16">6:16</span> Or do you not see that he who is joined
to a loose woman is one body with her? for God has said, The two of them
will become one flesh.

<span id="an_6:17">6:17</span> But he who is united to the Lord is one
spirit.

<span id="an_6:18">6:18</span> Keep away from the desires of the flesh.
Every sin which a man does is outside of the body; but he who goes after
the desires of the flesh does evil to his body.

<span id="an_6:19">6:19</span> Or are you not conscious that your body
is a house for the Holy Spirit which is in you, and which has been given
to you by God? and you are not the owners of yourselves;

<span id="an_6:20">6:20</span> For a payment has been made for you: let
God be honoured in your body.

<span id="an_7:1">7:1</span> Now, as to the things in your letter to me:
It is good for a man to have nothing to do with a woman.

<span id="an_7:2">7:2</span> But because of the desires of the flesh,
let every man have his wife, and every woman her husband.

<span id="an_7:3">7:3</span> Let the husband give to the wife what is
right; and let the wife do the same to the husband.

<span id="an_7:4">7:4</span> The wife has not power over her body, but
the husband; and in the same way the husband has not power over his
body, but the wife.

<span id="an_7:5">7:5</span> Do not keep back from one another what is
right, but only for a short time, and by agreement, so that you may give
yourselves to prayer, and come together again; so that Satan may not get
the better of you through your loss of self-control.

<span id="an_7:6">7:6</span> But this I say as my opinion, and not as an
order of the Lord.

<span id="an_7:7">7:7</span> It is my desire that all men might be even
as I am. But every man has the power of his special way of life given
him by God, one in this way and one in that.

<span id="an_7:8">7:8</span> But I say to the unmarried and to the
widows, It is good for them to be even as I am.

<span id="an_7:9">7:9</span> But if they have not self-control let them
get married; for married life is better than the burning of desire.

<span id="an_7:10">7:10</span> But to the married I give orders, though
not I but the Lord, that the wife may not go away from her husband

<span id="an_7:11">7:11</span> (Or if she goes away from him, let her
keep unmarried, or be united to her husband again); and that the husband
may not go away from his wife.

<span id="an_7:12">7:12</span> But to the rest I say, and not the Lord;
If a brother has a wife who is not a Christian, and it is her desire to
go on living with him, let him not go away from her.

<span id="an_7:13">7:13</span> And if a woman has a husband who is not a
Christian, and it is his desire to go on living with her, let her not go
away from her husband.

<span id="an_7:14">7:14</span> For the husband who has not faith is made
holy through his Christian wife, and the wife who is not a Christian is
made holy through the brother: if not, your children would be unholy,
but now are they holy.

<span id="an_7:15">7:15</span> But if the one who is not a Christian has
a desire to go away, let it be so: the brother or the sister in such a
position is not forced to do one thing or the other: but it is God's
pleasure that we may be at peace with one another.

<span id="an_7:16">7:16</span> For how may you be certain, O wife, that
you will not be the cause of salvation to your husband? or you, O
husband, that you may not do the same for your wife?

<span id="an_7:17">7:17</span> Only, as the Lord has given to a man, and
as is the purpose of God for him, so let him go on living. And these are
my orders for all the churches.

<span id="an_7:18">7:18</span> If any man who is a Christian has had
circumcision, let him keep so; and if any man who is a Christian has not
had circumcision, let him make no change.

<span id="an_7:19">7:19</span> Circumcision is nothing, and its opposite
is nothing, but only doing the orders of God is of value.

<span id="an_7:20">7:20</span> Let every man keep the position in which
he has been placed by God.

<span id="an_7:21">7:21</span> If you were a servant when you became a
Christian, let it not be a grief to you; but if you have a chance to
become free, make use of it.

<span id="an_7:22">7:22</span> For he who was a servant when he became a
Christian is the Lord's free man; and he who was free when he became a
Christian is the Lord's servant.

<span id="an_7:23">7:23</span> It is the Lord who has made payment for
you: be not servants of men.

<span id="an_7:24">7:24</span> My brothers, let every man keep in that
condition which is the purpose of God for him.

<span id="an_7:25">7:25</span> Now about virgins I have no orders from
the Lord: but I give my opinion as one to whom the Lord has given mercy
to be true to him.

<span id="an_7:26">7:26</span> In my opinion then, because of the
present trouble, it is good for a man to keep as he is.

<span id="an_7:27">7:27</span> If you are married to a wife, make no
attempt to get free from her: if you are free from a wife, do not take a
wife.

<span id="an_7:28">7:28</span> If you get married it is not a sin; and
if an unmarried woman gets married it is not a sin. But those who do so
will have trouble in the flesh. But I will not be hard on you.

<span id="an_7:29">7:29</span> But I say this, my brothers, the time is
short; and from now it will be wise for those who have wives to be as if
they had them not;

<span id="an_7:30">7:30</span> And for those who are in sorrow, to give
no signs of it; and for those who are glad, to give no signs of joy; and
for those who are getting property, to be as if they had nothing;

<span id="an_7:31">7:31</span> And for those who make use of the world,
not to be using it fully; for this world's way of life will quickly come
to an end.

<span id="an_7:32">7:32</span> But it is my desire for you to be free
from cares. The unmarried man gives his mind to the things of the Lord,
how he may give pleasure to the Lord:

<span id="an_7:33">7:33</span> But the married man gives his attention
to the things of this world, how he may give pleasure to his wife.

<span id="an_7:34">7:34</span> And the wife is not the same as the
virgin. The virgin gives her mind to the things of the Lord, so that she
may be holy in body and in spirit: but the married woman takes thought
for the things of the world, how she may give pleasure to her husband.

<span id="an_7:35">7:35</span> Now I say this for your profit; not to
make things hard for you, but because of what is right, and so that you
may be able to give all your attention to the things of the Lord.

<span id="an_7:36">7:36</span> But if, in any man's opinion, he is not
doing what is right for his virgin, if she is past her best years, and
there is need for it, let him do what seems right to him; it is no sin;
let them be married.

<span id="an_7:37">7:37</span> But the man who is strong in mind and
purpose, who is not forced but has control over his desires, does well
if he comes to the decision to keep her a virgin.

<span id="an_7:38">7:38</span> So then, he who gets married to his
virgin does well, and he who keeps her unmarried does better.

<span id="an_7:39">7:39</span> It is right for a wife to be with her
husband as long as he is living; but when her husband is dead, she is
free to be married to another; but only to a Christian.

<span id="an_7:40">7:40</span> But it will be better for her to keep as
she is, in my opinion: and it seems to me that I have the Spirit of God.

<span id="an_8:1">8:1</span> Now about things offered to images: we all
seem to ourselves to have knowledge. Knowledge gives pride, but love
gives true strength.

<span id="an_8:2">8:2</span> If anyone seems to himself to have
knowledge, so far he has not the right sort of knowledge about anything;

<span id="an_8:3">8:3</span> But if anyone has love for God, God has
knowledge of him.

<span id="an_8:4">8:4</span> So, then, as to the question of taking food
offered to images, we are certain that an image is nothing in the world,
and that there is no God but one.

<span id="an_8:5">8:5</span> For though there are those who have the
name of gods, in heaven or on earth, as there are a number of gods and a
number of lords,

<span id="an_8:6">8:6</span> There is for us only one God, the Father,
of whom are all things, and we are for him; and one Lord, Jesus Christ,
through whom are all things, and we have our being through him.

<span id="an_8:7">8:7</span> Still, all men have not that knowledge: but
some, being used till now to the image, are conscious that they are
taking food which has been offered to the image; and because they are
not strong in the faith, their minds are troubled.

<span id="an_8:8">8:8</span> But God's approval of us is not based on
the food we take: if we do not take it we are no worse for it; and if we
take it we are no better.

<span id="an_8:9">8:9</span> But take care that this power of yours does
not give cause for trouble to the feeble.

<span id="an_8:10">8:10</span> For if a man sees you, who have
knowledge, taking food as a guest in the house of an image, will it not
give him, if he is feeble, the idea that he may take food offered to
images?

<span id="an_8:11">8:11</span> And so, through your knowledge, you are
the cause of destruction to your brother, for whom Christ underwent
death.

<span id="an_8:12">8:12</span> And in this way, doing evil to the
brothers, and causing trouble to those whose faith is feeble, you are
sinning against Christ.

<span id="an_8:13">8:13</span> For this reason, if food is a cause of
trouble to my brother, I will give up taking meat for ever, so that I
may not be a cause of trouble to my brother.

<span id="an_9:1">9:1</span> Am I not free? am I not an Apostle? have I
not seen Jesus our Lord? are you not my work in the Lord?

<span id="an_9:2">9:2</span> If to others I am not an Apostle, at least
I am one to you: for the fact that you are Christians is the sign that I
am an Apostle.

<span id="an_9:3">9:3</span> My answer to those who are judging me is
this.

<span id="an_9:4">9:4</span> Have we no right to take food and drink?

<span id="an_9:5">9:5</span> Have we no right to take about with us a
Christian wife, like the rest of the Apostles, and the brothers of the
Lord, and Cephas?

<span id="an_9:6">9:6</span> Or I only and Barnabas, have we no right to
take a rest from work?

<span id="an_9:7">9:7</span> Who ever goes to war without looking to
someone to be responsible for his payment? who puts in vines and does
not take the fruit of them? or who takes care of sheep without drinking
of their milk?

<span id="an_9:8">9:8</span> Am I talking as a man? does not the law say
the same?

<span id="an_9:9">9:9</span> For it says in the law of Moses, It is not
right to keep the ox from taking the grain when he is crushing it. Is it
for the oxen that God is giving orders?

<span id="an_9:10">9:10</span> Or has he us in mind? Yes, it was said
for us; because it is right for the ploughman to do his ploughing in
hope, and for him who is crushing the grain to do his work hoping for a
part in the fruits of it.

<span id="an_9:11">9:11</span> If we have been planting the things of
the Spirit for you, does it seem a great thing for you to give us a part
in your things of this world?

<span id="an_9:12">9:12</span> If others have a part in this right over
you, have we not even more? But we did not make use of our right, so
that we might put nothing in the way of the good news of Christ.

<span id="an_9:13">9:13</span> Do you not see that the servants of the
holy things get their living from the Temple, and the servants of the
altar have their part in the food which is offered on the altar?

<span id="an_9:14">9:14</span> Even so did the Lord give orders that the
preachers of the good news might get their living from the good news.

<span id="an_9:15">9:15</span> But I have not made use of any of these
things: and I am not writing this in the hope that it may be so for me:
for it would be better for me to undergo death, than for any man to make
this pride of mine of no effect.

<span id="an_9:16">9:16</span> For if I am a preacher of the good news,
I have no cause for pride in this; because I am forced to do so, for a
curse is on me if I do not.

<span id="an_9:17">9:17</span> But if I do it gladly, I have a reward;
and if not, I am under orders to do it.

<span id="an_9:18">9:18</span> What then is my reward? This, that when I
am giving the good news, I may give it without payment, not making use
of my rights as a preacher of the good news.

<span id="an_9:19">9:19</span> For though I was free from all men, I
made myself a servant to all, so that more might have salvation.

<span id="an_9:20">9:20</span> And to the Jews I was as a Jew, so that I
might give the good news to them; to those under the law I was the same,
not as being myself under the law, but so that I might give the good
news to those under the law.

<span id="an_9:21">9:21</span> To those without the law I was as one
without the law, not as being without law to God, but as under law to
Christ, so that I might give the good news to those without the law.

<span id="an_9:22">9:22</span> To the feeble, I was as one who is
feeble, so that they might have salvation: I have been all things to all
men, so that some at least might have salvation.

<span id="an_9:23">9:23</span> And I do all things for the cause of the
good news, so that I may have a part in it.

<span id="an_9:24">9:24</span> Do you not see that in a running
competition all take part, but only one gets the reward? So let your
minds be fixed on the reward.

<span id="an_9:25">9:25</span> And every man who takes part in the
sports has self-control in all things. Now they do it to get a crown
which is of this world, but we for an eternal crown.

<span id="an_9:26">9:26</span> So then I am running, not uncertainly; so
I am fighting, not as one who gives blows in the air:

<span id="an_9:27">9:27</span> But I give blows to my body, and keep it
under control, for fear that, after having given the good news to
others, I myself might not have God's approval.

<span id="an_10:1">10:1</span> For it is my desire, my brothers, that
you may keep in mind how all our fathers were under the cloud, and they
all went through the sea;

<span id="an_10:2">10:2</span> And they all had baptism from Moses in
the cloud and in the sea;

<span id="an_10:3">10:3</span> And they all took the same holy food;

<span id="an_10:4">10:4</span> And the same holy drink: for they all
took of the water from the holy rock which came after them: and the rock
was Christ.

<span id="an_10:5">10:5</span> But with most of them God was not
pleased: for they came to their end in the waste land.

<span id="an_10:6">10:6</span> Now these things were for an example to
us, so that our hearts might not go after evil things, as they did.

<span id="an_10:7">10:7</span> Then do not go after false gods, as some
of them did; as it is said in the holy Writings, After resting and
feasting, the people got up to take their pleasure.

<span id="an_10:8">10:8</span> Again, let us not give way to the desires
of the flesh, as some of them did, of whom twenty-three thousand came to
their end in one day.

<span id="an_10:9">10:9</span> And let us not put the Lord to the test,
as some of them did, and came to their death by snakes.

<span id="an_10:10">10:10</span> And do not say evil things against the
Lord, as some of them did, and destruction overtook them.

<span id="an_10:11">10:11</span> Now these things were done as an
example; and were put down in writing for our teaching, on whom the last
days have come.

<span id="an_10:12">10:12</span> So let him who seems to himself to be
safe go in fear of a fall.

<span id="an_10:13">10:13</span> You have been put to no test but such
as is common to man: and God is true, who will not let any test come on
you which you are not able to undergo; but he will make with the test a
way out of it, so that you may be able to go through it.

<span id="an_10:14">10:14</span> For this cause, my dear brothers, give
no worship to false gods.

<span id="an_10:15">10:15</span> What I am saying is for wise men, do
you be the judges of it.

<span id="an_10:16">10:16</span> The cup of blessing which we take, does
it not give us a part in the blood of Christ? and is not the broken
bread a taking part in the body of Christ?

<span id="an_10:17">10:17</span> Because we, being a number of persons,
are one bread, we are one body: for we all take part in the one bread.

<span id="an_10:18">10:18</span> See Israel after the flesh: do not
those who take as food the offerings of the altar take a part in the
altar?

<span id="an_10:19">10:19</span> Do I say, then, that what is offered to
images is anything, or that the image is anything?

<span id="an_10:20">10:20</span> What I say is that the things offered
by the Gentiles are offered to evil spirits and not to God; and it is
not my desire for you to have any part with evil spirits.

<span id="an_10:21">10:21</span> It is not possible for you, at the same
time, to take the cup of the Lord and the cup of evil spirits; you may
not take part in the table of the Lord and the table of evil spirits.

<span id="an_10:22">10:22</span> Or may we be the cause of envy to the
Lord? are we stronger than he?

<span id="an_10:23">10:23</span> We are free to do all things, but there
are things which it is not wise to do. We are free to do all things, but
not all things are for the common good.

<span id="an_10:24">10:24</span> Let a man give attention not only to
what is good for himself, but equally to his neighbour's good.

<span id="an_10:25">10:25</span> Whatever meat may be had at the public
market, take as food without question of right or wrong;

<span id="an_10:26">10:26</span> For the earth is the Lord's and all
things in it.

<span id="an_10:27">10:27</span> If a Gentile makes a feast for you, and
you are pleased to go as a guest, take whatever is put before you,
without question of right or wrong.

<span id="an_10:28">10:28</span> But if anyone says to you, This food
has been used as an offering, do not take it, on account of him who said
it, and on account of his sense of right and wrong:

<span id="an_10:29">10:29</span> Right and wrong, I say, not for you,
but for the other man; for the fact that I am free is not dependent on
another man's sense of right or wrong.

<span id="an_10:30">10:30</span> But if I give praise to God for the
food which I take, let no man say evil of me for that reason.

<span id="an_10:31">10:31</span> So then, if it is a question of food or
drink, or any other thing, whatever you do, do all to the glory of God.

<span id="an_10:32">10:32</span> Give no cause of trouble to Jews, or to
Greeks, or to the church of God.

<span id="an_10:33">10:33</span> Even as I give way to all men in all
things, not looking for profit for myself, but for the good of others,
that they may get salvation.

<span id="an_11:1">11:1</span> So take me for your example, even as I
take Christ for mine.

<span id="an_11:2">11:2</span> Now I am pleased to see that you keep me
in memory in all things, and that you give attention to the teaching
which was handed down from me to you.

<span id="an_11:3">11:3</span> But it is important for you to keep this
fact in mind, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the
woman is the man, and the head of Christ is God.

<span id="an_11:4">11:4</span> Every man who takes part in prayer, or
gives teaching as a prophet, with his head covered, puts shame on his
head.

<span id="an_11:5">11:5</span> But every woman who does so with her head
unveiled, puts shame on her head: for it is the same as if her hair was
cut off.

<span id="an_11:6">11:6</span> For if a woman is not veiled, let her
hair be cut off; but if it is a shame to a woman to have her hair cut
off, let her be veiled.

<span id="an_11:7">11:7</span> For it is not right for a man to have his
head covered, because he is the image and glory of God: but the woman is
the glory of the man.

<span id="an_11:8">11:8</span> For the man did not come from the woman,
but the woman from the man.

<span id="an_11:9">11:9</span> And the man was not made for the woman,
but the woman for the man.

<span id="an_11:10">11:10</span> For this reason it is right for the
woman to have a sign of authority on her head, because of the angels.

<span id="an_11:11">11:11</span> But the woman is not separate from the
man, and the man is not separate from the woman in the Lord.

<span id="an_11:12">11:12</span> For as the woman is from the man, so
the man is through the woman; but all things are from God.

<span id="an_11:13">11:13</span> Be judges yourselves of the question:
does it seem right for a woman to take part in prayer unveiled?

<span id="an_11:14">11:14</span> Does it not seem natural to you that if
a man has long hair, it is a cause of shame to him?

<span id="an_11:15">11:15</span> But if a woman has long hair, it is a
glory to her: for her hair is given to her for a covering.

<span id="an_11:16">11:16</span> But if any man will not be ruled in
this question, this is not our way of doing things, and it is not done
in the churches of God.

<span id="an_11:17">11:17</span> But in giving you this order, there is
one thing about which I am not pleased: it is that when you come
together it is not for the better but for the worse.

<span id="an_11:18">11:18</span> For first of all, it has come to my
ears that when you come together in the church, there are divisions
among you, and I take the statement to be true in part.

<span id="an_11:19">11:19</span> For divisions are necessary among you,
in order that those who have God's approval may be clearly seen among
you.

<span id="an_11:20">11:20</span> But now, when you come together, it is
not possible to take the holy meal of the Lord:

<span id="an_11:21">11:21</span> For when you take your food, everyone
takes his meal before the other; and one has not enough food, and
another is the worse for drink.

<span id="an_11:22">11:22</span> What? have you not houses to take your
meals in? or have you no respect for the church of God, putting the poor
to shame? What am I to say to you? am I to give you praise? certainly
not.

<span id="an_11:23">11:23</span> For it was handed down to me from the
Lord, as I gave it to you, that the Lord Jesus, on the night when Judas
was false to him, took bread,

<span id="an_11:24">11:24</span> And when it had been broken with an act
of praise, he said, This is my body which is for you: do this in memory
of me.

<span id="an_11:25">11:25</span> In the same way, with the cup, after
the meal, he said, This cup is the new testament in my blood: do this,
whenever you take it, in memory of me.

<span id="an_11:26">11:26</span> For whenever you take the bread and the
cup you give witness to the Lord's death till he comes.

<span id="an_11:27">11:27</span> If, then, anyone takes the bread or the
cup of the Lord in the wrong spirit, he will be responsible for the body
and blood of the Lord.

<span id="an_11:28">11:28</span> But let no man take of the bread and
the cup without testing himself.

<span id="an_11:29">11:29</span> For a man puts himself in danger, if he
takes part in the holy meal without being conscious that it is the
Lord's body.

<span id="an_11:30">11:30</span> For this cause a number of you are
feeble and ill, and a number are dead.

<span id="an_11:31">11:31</span> But if we were true judges of
ourselves, punishment would not come on us.

<span id="an_11:32">11:32</span> But if punishment does come, it is sent
by the Lord, so that we may be safe when the world is judged.

<span id="an_11:33">11:33</span> So then, my brothers, when you come
together to the holy meal of the Lord, let there be waiting for one
another.

<span id="an_11:34">11:34</span> If any man is in need of food, let him
take his meal in his house; so that you may not come together to your
damage. And the rest I will put in order when I come.

<span id="an_12:1">12:1</span> But about the things of the spirit, my
brothers, it is not right for you to be without teaching.

<span id="an_12:2">12:2</span> You are conscious that when you were
Gentiles, in whatever way you were guided, you went after images without
voice or power.

<span id="an_12:3">12:3</span> So it is my desire for you to be clear
about this; that no one is able to say by the Spirit of God that Jesus
is cursed; and no one is able to say that Jesus is Lord, but by the Holy
Spirit.

<span id="an_12:4">12:4</span> Now there are different qualities given
to men, but the same Spirit.

<span id="an_12:5">12:5</span> And there are different sorts of
servants, but the same Lord.

<span id="an_12:6">12:6</span> And there are different operations, but
the same God, who is working all things in all.

<span id="an_12:7">12:7</span> But to every man some form of the
Spirit's working is given for the common good.

<span id="an_12:8">12:8</span> For to one are given words of wisdom
through the Spirit; and to another words of knowledge through the same
Spirit:

<span id="an_12:9">12:9</span> To another faith in the same Spirit; and
to another the power of taking away disease, by the one Spirit;

<span id="an_12:10">12:10</span> And to another the power of working
wonders; and to another the prophet's word; and to another the power of
testing spirits; to another different sorts of tongues; and to another
the power of making clear the sense of the tongues:

<span id="an_12:11">12:11</span> But all these are the operations of the
one and the same Spirit, giving to every man separately as his pleasure
is.

<span id="an_12:12">12:12</span> For as the body is one, and has a
number of parts, and all the parts make one body, so is Christ.

<span id="an_12:13">12:13</span> For through the baptism of the one
Spirit we were all formed into one body, Jews or Greeks, servants or
free men, and were all made full of the same Spirit.

<span id="an_12:14">12:14</span> For the body is not one part, but a
number of parts.

<span id="an_12:15">12:15</span> If the foot says, Because I am not the
hand, I am not a part of the body; it is no less a part of the body.

<span id="an_12:16">12:16</span> And if the ear says, Because I am not
the eye, I am not a part of the body; it is a part of the body all the
same.

<span id="an_12:17">12:17</span> If all the body was an eye, where would
be the hearing? if all was hearing, where would be the smelling?

<span id="an_12:18">12:18</span> But now God has put every one of the
parts in the body as it was pleasing to him.

<span id="an_12:19">12:19</span> And if they were all one part, where
would the body be?

<span id="an_12:20">12:20</span> But now they are all different parts,
but one body.

<span id="an_12:21">12:21</span> And the eye may not say to the hand, I
have no need of you: or again the head to the feet, I have no need of
you.

<span id="an_12:22">12:22</span> No, those parts which seem to be feeble
are the more necessary;

<span id="an_12:23">12:23</span> And to those parts of the body which
seem to have less honour we give all the more honour; and to those parts
of the body which are a cause of shame to us we give the greater
respect;

<span id="an_12:24">12:24</span> But those parts of the body which are
beautiful have no need of such care: and so the body has been joined
together by God in such a way as to give more honour to those parts
which had need of it;

<span id="an_12:25">12:25</span> So that there might be no division in
the body; but all the parts might have the same care for one another.

<span id="an_12:26">12:26</span> And if there is pain in one part of the
body, all the parts will be feeling it; or if one part is honoured, all
the parts will be glad.

<span id="an_12:27">12:27</span> Now you are the body of Christ, and
every one of you the separate parts of it.

<span id="an_12:28">12:28</span> And God has put some in the church,
first, Apostles; second, prophets; third, teachers; then those with
wonder-working powers, then those with the power of taking away disease,
helpers, wise guides, users of strange tongues.

<span id="an_12:29">12:29</span> Are all Apostles? are all prophets? are
all teachers? have all the power of working wonders?

<span id="an_12:30">12:30</span> Are all able to take away disease? have
all the power of tongues? are all able to give their sense?

<span id="an_12:31">12:31</span> But let your desires be turned to the
more important things given by the Spirit. And now I am pointing out to
you an even better way.

<span id="an_13:1">13:1</span> If I make use of the tongues of men and
of angels, and have not love, I am like sounding brass, or a
loud-tongued bell.

<span id="an_13:2">13:2</span> And if I have a prophet's power, and have
knowledge of all secret things; and if I have all faith, by which
mountains may be moved from their place, but have not love, I am
nothing.

<span id="an_13:3">13:3</span> And if I give all my goods to the poor,
and if I give my body to be burned, but have not love, it is of no
profit to me.

<span id="an_13:4">13:4</span> Love is never tired of waiting; love is
kind; love has no envy; love has no high opinion of itself, love has no
pride;

<span id="an_13:5">13:5</span> Love's ways are ever fair, it takes no
thought for itself; it is not quickly made angry, it takes no account of
evil;

<span id="an_13:6">13:6</span> It takes no pleasure in wrongdoing, but
has joy in what is true;

<span id="an_13:7">13:7</span> Love has the power of undergoing all
things, having faith in all things, hoping all things.

<span id="an_13:8">13:8</span> Though the prophet's word may come to an
end, tongues come to nothing, and knowledge have no more value, love has
no end.

<span id="an_13:9">13:9</span> For our knowledge is only in part, and
the prophet's word gives only a part of what is true:

<span id="an_13:10">13:10</span> But when that which is complete is
come, then that which is in part will be no longer necessary.

<span id="an_13:11">13:11</span> When I was a child, I made use of a
child's language, I had a child's feelings and a child's thoughts: now
that I am a man, I have put away the things of a child.

<span id="an_13:12">13:12</span> For now we see things in a glass,
darkly; but then face to face: now my knowledge is in part; then it will
be complete, even as God's knowledge of me.

<span id="an_13:13">13:13</span> But now we still have faith, hope,
love, these three; and the greatest of these is love.

<span id="an_14:1">14:1</span> Go after love; still desiring to have the
things which the Spirit gives, but most of all that you may have the
prophet's power.

<span id="an_14:2">14:2</span> For he who makes use of tongues is not
talking to men but to God; because no one has the sense of what he is
saying; but in the Spirit he is talking of secret things.

<span id="an_14:3">14:3</span> But the word of the prophet gives men
knowledge and comfort and strength.

<span id="an_14:4">14:4</span> He who makes use of tongues may do good
to himself; but he who gives the prophet's word does good to the church.

<span id="an_14:5">14:5</span> Now though it is my desire for you all to
have the power of tongues, it would give me more pleasure to be hearing
the prophet's word from you; for this is a greater thing than using
tongues, if the sense is not given at the same time, for the good of the
church.

<span id="an_14:6">14:6</span> But, now, my brothers, if I come to you
using tongues, what profit will it be to you, if I do not give you a
revelation, or knowledge, or the word of the prophet, or teaching?

<span id="an_14:7">14:7</span> Even things without life, having a voice,
such as a music-pipe or other instrument, if they do not give out
different sounds, who may be certain what is being played?

<span id="an_14:8">14:8</span> For if the war-horn gives out an
uncertain note, who will get ready for the fight?

<span id="an_14:9">14:9</span> So if you, in using a strange tongue, say
words which have no sense, how will anyone take in what you are saying?
for you will be talking to the air.

<span id="an_14:10">14:10</span> There are, it may be, a number of
different voices in the world, and no voice is without sense.

<span id="an_14:11">14:11</span> But if the sense of the voice is not
clear to me, I am like a man from a strange country to him who is
talking, and he will be the same to me.

<span id="an_14:12">14:12</span> So if you are desiring the things which
the Spirit gives, let your minds be turned first to the things which are
for the good of the church.

<span id="an_14:13">14:13</span> For this reason, let the man who has
the power of using tongues make request that he may, at the same time,
be able to give the sense.

<span id="an_14:14">14:14</span> For if I make use of tongues in my
prayers, my spirit makes the prayer, but not my mind.

<span id="an_14:15">14:15</span> What then? let my prayer be from the
spirit, and equally from the mind; let my song be from the spirit, and
equally from mind.

<span id="an_14:16">14:16</span> For if you give a blessing with the
spirit, how will the man who has no knowledge say, So be it, after your
prayer, seeing that he has not taken in what you are saying?

<span id="an_14:17">14:17</span> For your giving of the blessing is
certainly well done, but of no profit to the man without knowledge.

<span id="an_14:18">14:18</span> I give praise to God that I am able to
make use of tongues more than you all:

<span id="an_14:19">14:19</span> But in the church it would be better
for me to make use of five words of which the sense was clear, so that
others might have profit, than ten thousand words in a strange tongue.

<span id="an_14:20">14:20</span> My brothers, do not be children in
mind: in evil be as little children, but in mind be of full growth.

<span id="an_14:21">14:21</span> In the law it is said, By men of other
tongues and by strange lips will my words come to this people; and not
even so will they give ear to me, says the Lord.

<span id="an_14:22">14:22</span> For this reason tongues are for a sign,
not to those who have faith, but to those who have not: but the
prophet's word is for those who have faith, and not for the rest who
have not.

<span id="an_14:23">14:23</span> If, then, the church has come together,
and all are using tongues, and there come in men without knowledge or
faith, will they not say that you are unbalanced?

<span id="an_14:24">14:24</span> But if all are teaching as prophets,
and a man without faith or knowledge comes in, he is tested by all, he
is judged by all;

<span id="an_14:25">14:25</span> The secrets of his heart are made
clear; and he will go down on his face and give worship to God, saying
that God is truly among you.

<span id="an_14:26">14:26</span> What is it then, my brothers? when you
come together everyone has a holy song, or a revelation, or a tongue, or
is giving the sense of it. Let everything be done for the common good.

<span id="an_14:27">14:27</span> If any man makes use of a tongue, let
it not be more than two, or at the most three, and in turn; and let
someone give the sense:

<span id="an_14:28">14:28</span> But if there is no one to give the
sense, let him keep quiet in the church; and let his words be to himself
and to God.

<span id="an_14:29">14:29</span> And let the prophets give their words,
but not more than two or three, and let the others be judges of what
they say.

<span id="an_14:30">14:30</span> But if a revelation is given to another
who is seated near, let the first be quiet.

<span id="an_14:31">14:31</span> For you may all be prophets in turn so
that all may get knowledge and comfort;

<span id="an_14:32">14:32</span> And the spirits of the prophets are
controlled by the prophets;

<span id="an_14:33">14:33</span> For God is not a God whose ways are
without order, but a God of peace; as in all the churches of the saints.

<span id="an_14:34">14:34</span> Let women keep quiet in the churches:
for it is not right for them to be talking; but let them be under
control, as it says in the law.

<span id="an_14:35">14:35</span> And if they have a desire for knowledge
about anything, let them put questions to their husbands privately: for
talking in the church puts shame on a woman.

<span id="an_14:36">14:36</span> What? was it from you that the word of
God went out? or did it only come in to you?

<span id="an_14:37">14:37</span> If any man seems to himself to be a
prophet or to have the Spirit, let him take note of the things which I
am writing to you, as being the word of the Lord.

<span id="an_14:38">14:38</span> But if any man is without knowledge,
let him be so.

<span id="an_14:39">14:39</span> So then, my brothers, let it be your
chief desire to be prophets; but let no one be stopped from using
tongues.

<span id="an_14:40">14:40</span> Let all things be done in the right and
ordered way.

<span id="an_15:1">15:1</span> Now I am going to make clear to you, my
brothers, what the good news was which I gave to you, and which you
took, and on which your faith is based,

<span id="an_15:2">15:2</span> By which you have salvation; that is to
say, the form in which it was given to you, if it is fixed in your
minds, and if your faith in it is not without effect.

<span id="an_15:3">15:3</span> For I gave to you first of all what was
handed down to me, how Christ underwent death for our sins, as it says
in the Writings;

<span id="an_15:4">15:4</span> And he was put in the place of the dead;
and on the third day he came back from the dead, as it says in the
Writings;

<span id="an_15:5">15:5</span> And he was seen by Cephas; then by the
twelve;

<span id="an_15:6">15:6</span> Then by more than five hundred brothers
at the same time, most of whom are still living, but some are sleeping;

<span id="an_15:7">15:7</span> Then he was seen by James; then by all
the Apostles.

<span id="an_15:8">15:8</span> And last of all, as by one whose birth
was out of the right time, he was seen by me.

<span id="an_15:9">15:9</span> For I am the least of the Apostles,
having no right to be named an Apostle, because of my cruel attacks on
the church of God.

<span id="an_15:10">15:10</span> But by the grace of God, I am what I
am: and his grace which was given to me has not been for nothing; for I
did more work than all of them; though not I, but the grace of God which
was with me.

<span id="an_15:11">15:11</span> If then it is I who am the preacher, or
they, this is our word, and to this you have given your faith.

<span id="an_15:12">15:12</span> Now if the good news says that Christ
came back from the dead, how do some of you say that there is no coming
back from the dead?

<span id="an_15:13">15:13</span> But if there is no coming back from the
dead, then Christ has not come back from the dead:

<span id="an_15:14">15:14</span> And if Christ did not come again from
the dead, then our good news and your faith in it are of no effect.

<span id="an_15:15">15:15</span> Yes, and we are seen to be false
witnesses of God; because we gave witness of God that by his power
Christ came again from the dead: which is not true if there is no coming
back from the dead.

<span id="an_15:16">15:16</span> For if it is not possible for the dead
to come to life again, then Christ has not come to life again:

<span id="an_15:17">15:17</span> And if that is so, your faith is of no
effect; you are still in your sins.

<span id="an_15:18">15:18</span> And, in addition, the dead in Christ
have gone to destruction.

<span id="an_15:19">15:19</span> If in this life only we have hope in
Christ, we are of all men most unhappy.

<span id="an_15:20">15:20</span> But now Christ has truly come back from
the dead, the first-fruits of those who are sleeping.

<span id="an_15:21">15:21</span> For as by man came death, so by man
there is a coming back from the dead.

<span id="an_15:22">15:22</span> For as in Adam death comes to all, so
in Christ will all come back to life.

<span id="an_15:23">15:23</span> But every man in his right order:
Christ the first-fruits; then those who are Christ's at his coming.

<span id="an_15:24">15:24</span> Then comes the end, when he will give
up the kingdom to God, even the Father; when he will have put an end to
all rule and to all authority and power.

<span id="an_15:25">15:25</span> For his rule will go on till he has put
all those who are against him under his feet.

<span id="an_15:26">15:26</span> The last power to come to an end is
death.

<span id="an_15:27">15:27</span> For, as it says, He has put all things
under his feet. But when he says, All things are put under him, it is
clear that it is not said about him who put all things under him.

<span id="an_15:28">15:28</span> And when all things have been put under
him, then will the Son himself be under him who put all things under
him, so that God may be all in all.

<span id="an_15:29">15:29</span> Again, what will they do who are given
baptism for the dead? if the dead do not come back at all, why are
people given baptism for them?

<span id="an_15:30">15:30</span> And why are we in danger every hour?

<span id="an_15:31">15:31</span> Yes, truly, by your pride in me, my
brothers in Christ Jesus our Lord, my life is one long death.

<span id="an_15:32">15:32</span> If, after the way of men, I was
fighting with beasts at Ephesus, what profit is it to me? If the dead do
not come to life again, let us take our pleasure in feasting, for
tomorrow we come to an end.

<span id="an_15:33">15:33</span> Do not be tricked by false words: evil
company does damage to good behaviour.

<span id="an_15:34">15:34</span> Be awake to righteousness and keep
yourselves from sin; for some have no knowledge of God: I say this to
put you to shame.

<span id="an_15:35">15:35</span> But someone will say, How do the dead
come back? and with what sort of body do they come?

<span id="an_15:36">15:36</span> Foolish man, it is necessary for the
seed which you put into the earth to undergo death in order that it may
come to life again:

<span id="an_15:37">15:37</span> And when you put it into the earth, you
do not put in the body which it will be, but only the seed, of grain or
some other sort of plant;

<span id="an_15:38">15:38</span> But God gives it a body, as it is
pleasing to him, and to every seed its special body.

<span id="an_15:39">15:39</span> All flesh is not the same flesh: but
there is one flesh of men, another of beasts, another of birds, and
another of fishes.

<span id="an_15:40">15:40</span> And there are bodies of heaven and
bodies of earth, but the glory of the one is different from that of the
other.

<span id="an_15:41">15:41</span> There is one glory of the sun, and
another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars; for the glory
of one star is different from that of another.

<span id="an_15:42">15:42</span> So is it with the coming back from the
dead. It is planted in death; it comes again in life:

<span id="an_15:43">15:43</span> It is planted in shame; it comes again
in glory: feeble when it is planted, it comes again in power:

<span id="an_15:44">15:44</span> It is planted a natural body; it comes
again as a body of the spirit. If there is a natural body, there is
equally a body of the spirit.

<span id="an_15:45">15:45</span> And so it is said, The first man Adam
was a living soul. The last Adam is a life-giving spirit.

<span id="an_15:46">15:46</span> But that which is natural comes before
that which is of the spirit.

<span id="an_15:47">15:47</span> The first man is from the earth, and of
the earth: the second man is from heaven.

<span id="an_15:48">15:48</span> Those who are of the earth are like the
man who was from the earth: and those who are of heaven are like the one
from heaven.

<span id="an_15:49">15:49</span> And in the same way as we have taken on
us the image of the man from the earth, so we will take on us the image
of the one from heaven.

<span id="an_15:50">15:50</span> Now I say this, my brothers, that it is
not possible for flesh and blood to have a part in the kingdom of God;
and death may not have a part in life.

<span id="an_15:51">15:51</span> See, I am giving you the revelation of
a secret: we will not all come to the sleep of death, but we will all be
changed.

<span id="an_15:52">15:52</span> In a second, in the shutting of an eye,
at the sound of the last horn: for at that sound the dead will come
again, free for ever from the power of death, and we will be changed.

<span id="an_15:53">15:53</span> For this body which comes to
destruction will be made free from the power of death, and the man who
is under the power of death will put on eternal life.

<span id="an_15:54">15:54</span> But when this has taken place, then
that which was said in the Writings will come true, Death is overcome by
life.

<span id="an_15:55">15:55</span> O death, where is your power? O death,
where are your pains?

<span id="an_15:56">15:56</span> The pain of death is sin; and the power
of sin is the law:

<span id="an_15:57">15:57</span> But praise be to God who gives us
strength to overcome through our Lord Jesus Christ.

<span id="an_15:58">15:58</span> For this cause, my dear brothers, be
strong in purpose and unmoved, ever giving yourselves to the work of the
Lord, because you are certain that your work is not without effect in
the Lord.

<span id="an_16:1">16:1</span> Now about the giving of money for the
saints, as I gave orders to the churches of Galatia, so do you.

<span id="an_16:2">16:2</span> On the first day of the week, let every
one of you put by him in store, in measure as he has done well in
business, so that it may not be necessary to get money together when I
come.

<span id="an_16:3">16:3</span> And when I come, I will send the men of
your selection with letters to take the money you have got together to
Jerusalem.

<span id="an_16:4">16:4</span> And if it is possible for me to go there,
they will go with me.

<span id="an_16:5">16:5</span> But I will come to you after I have gone
through Macedonia, for that is my purpose;

<span id="an_16:6">16:6</span> But I may be with you for a time, or even
for the winter, so that you may see me on my way, wherever I go.

<span id="an_16:7">16:7</span> For it is not my desire to see you now,
on my way; because it is my hope to be with you for some time, if that
is the Lord's pleasure.

<span id="an_16:8">16:8</span> But I will be at Ephesus till Pentecost;

<span id="an_16:9">16:9</span> For a great and important door there is
open to me, and there are a number of people against me.

<span id="an_16:10">16:10</span> Now if Timothy comes, see that he is
with you without fear; because he is doing the Lord's work, even as I
am:

<span id="an_16:11">16:11</span> See then that he has the honour which
is right. But send him on his way in peace, so that he may come to me:
for I am looking for him with the brothers.

<span id="an_16:12">16:12</span> But as for Apollos, the brother, I had
a great desire for him to come to you with the brothers, but it was not
his pleasure to come now; but he will come when he has a chance.

<span id="an_16:13">16:13</span> Be on the watch, unmoved in the faith,
and be strong like men.

<span id="an_16:14">16:14</span> Let all you do be done in love.

<span id="an_16:15">16:15</span> Now I make my request to you, my
brothers, for you have knowledge that the house of Stephanas is the
first-fruits of Achaia, and that they have made themselves the servants
of the saints,

<span id="an_16:16">16:16</span> That you put yourselves under such, and
under everyone who is helping the Lord's work.

<span id="an_16:17">16:17</span> And I am glad of the coming of
Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus: for they have done what was
needed to make your work complete.

<span id="an_16:18">16:18</span> For they gave comfort to my spirit and
to yours: for which cause give respect to such people.

<span id="an_16:19">16:19</span> The churches of Asia send their love to
you. So do Aquila and Prisca, with the church which is in their house.

<span id="an_16:20">16:20</span> All the brothers send their love to
you. Give one another a holy kiss.

<span id="an_16:21">16:21</span> I, Paul, send you these words of love
in my writing.

<span id="an_16:22">16:22</span> If any man has not love for the Lord,
let him be cursed. Maran atha (our Lord comes).

<span id="an_16:23">16:23</span> The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be
with you.

<span id="an_16:24">16:24</span> My love be with you all in Christ
Jesus. So be it.
