### Basic English Bible: 3 John

<span id="an_1:1">1:1</span> I, a ruler in the church, send word to the
well loved Gaius, for whom I have true love.

<span id="an_1:2">1:2</span> My loved one, it is my prayer that you may
do well in all things, and be healthy in body, even as your soul does
well.

<span id="an_1:3">1:3</span> For it gave me great joy when some of the
brothers came and gave witness that you had the true faith and were
walking in the true way.

<span id="an_1:4">1:4</span> I have no greater joy than to have news
that my children are walking in the true way.

<span id="an_1:5">1:5</span> My loved one, you are doing a good work in
being kind to those brothers who come from other places;

<span id="an_1:6">1:6</span> Who have given witness to the church of
your love for them: and you will do well to send them on their way well
cared for, as is right for servants of God:

<span id="an_1:7">1:7</span> For they went out for love of the Name,
taking nothing from the Gentiles.

<span id="an_1:8">1:8</span> So it is right for us to take in such men
as guests, so that we may take our part in the work of the true faith.

<span id="an_1:9">1:9</span> I sent a letter to the church, but
Diotrephes, whose desire is ever to have the first place among them,
will not have us there.

<span id="an_1:10">1:10</span> So if I come, I will keep in mind the
things he does, talking against us with evil words: and as if this was
not enough, he does not take the brothers into his house, and those who
are ready to take them in, he keeps from doing so, putting them out of
the church if they do.

<span id="an_1:11">1:11</span> My loved one, do not be copying what is
evil, but what is good. He who does good is of God: he who does evil has
not seen God.

<span id="an_1:12">1:12</span> Demetrius has the approval of all men and
of what is true: and we give the same witness, and you are certain that
our witness is true.

<span id="an_1:13">1:13</span> I had much to say to you, but it is not
my purpose to put it all down with ink and pen:

<span id="an_1:14">1:14</span> But I am hoping to see you in a short
time, and to have talk with you face to face.

<span id="an_1:15">1:15</span> May you have peace. Your friends here
send you their love. Give my love to our friends by name.
