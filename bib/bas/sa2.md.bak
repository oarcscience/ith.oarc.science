### Basic English Bible: 2 Samuel

<span id="an_1:1">1:1</span> Now after the death of Saul, when David,
having come back from the destruction of the Amalekites, had been in
Ziklag for two days;

<span id="an_1:2">1:2</span> On the third day a man came from Saul's
tents, with his clothing out of order and earth on his head: and when he
came to David, he went down on the earth and gave him honour.

<span id="an_1:3">1:3</span> And David said to him, Where have you come
from? And he said, I have come in flight from the tents of Israel.

<span id="an_1:4">1:4</span> And David said to him, How did things go?
Give me the news. And in answer he said, The people have gone in flight
from the fight, and a great number of them are dead; and Saul and his
son Jonathan are dead.

<span id="an_1:5">1:5</span> And David said to the young man who gave
him the news, Why are you certain that Saul and his son Jonathan are
dead?

<span id="an_1:6">1:6</span> And the young man said, I came by chance to
Mount Gilboa, and I saw Saul supporting himself on his spear; and the
war-carriages and horsemen overtook him.

<span id="an_1:7">1:7</span> And looking back, he saw me and gave a cry
to me. And answering him I said, Here am I.

<span id="an_1:8">1:8</span> And he said to me, Who are you? And I said,
I am an Amalekite.

<span id="an_1:9">1:9</span> Then he said to me, Come here to my side,
and put me to death, for the pain of death has me in its grip but my
life is still strong in me.

<span id="an_1:10">1:10</span> So I put my foot on him and gave him his
death-blow, because I was certain that he would not go on living after
his fall: and I took the crown from his head and the band from his arm,
and I have them here for my lord.

<span id="an_1:11">1:11</span> Then David gave way to bitter grief, and
so did all the men who were with him:

<span id="an_1:12">1:12</span> And till evening they gave themselves to
sorrow and weeping, and took no food, weeping for Saul and for Jonathan,
his son, and for the people of the Lord and for the men of Israel;
because they had come to their end by the sword.

<span id="an_1:13">1:13</span> And David said to the young man who had
given him the news, Where do you come from? And he said, I am the son of
a man from a strange land; I am an Amalekite.

<span id="an_1:14">1:14</span> And David said to him, Had you no fear of
stretching out your hand to put to death the one marked with the holy
oil?

<span id="an_1:15">1:15</span> And David sent for one of his young men
and said, Go near and put an end to him. And he put him to death.

<span id="an_1:16">1:16</span> And David said to him, May your blood be
on your head; for your mouth has given witness against you, saying, I
have put to death the man marked with the holy oil.

<span id="an_1:17">1:17</span> Then David made this song of grief for
Saul and Jonathan, his son:

<span id="an_1:18">1:18</span> (It is recorded in the book of Jashar for
teaching to the sons of Judah) and he said:

<span id="an_1:19">1:19</span> The glory, O Israel, is dead on your high
places! How have the great ones been made low!

<span id="an_1:20">1:20</span> Give no news of it in Gath, let it not be
said in the streets of Ashkelon; or the daughters of the Philistines
will be glad, the daughters of men without circumcision will be uplifted
in joy.

<span id="an_1:21">1:21</span> O mountains of Gilboa, let there be no
dew or rain on you, you fields of death: for there the arms of the
strong have been shamed, the arms of Saul, as if he had not been marked
with the holy oil.

<span id="an_1:22">1:22</span> From the blood of the dead, from the fat
of the strong, the bow of Jonathan was not turned back, the sword of
Saul did not come back unused.

<span id="an_1:23">1:23</span> Saul and Jonathan were loved and
pleasing; in their lives and in their death they were not parted; they
went more quickly than eagles, they were stronger than lions.

<span id="an_1:24">1:24</span> O daughters of Israel, have sorrow for
Saul, by whom you were delicately clothed in robes of red, with
ornaments of gold on your dresses.

<span id="an_1:25">1:25</span> How have the great ones been made low in
the fight! Jonathan is dead on your high places.

<span id="an_1:26">1:26</span> I am full of grief for you, my brother
Jonathan: very dear have you been to me: your love for me was a wonder,
greater than the love of women.

<span id="an_1:27">1:27</span> How have the great ones been made low,
and the arms of war broken!

<span id="an_2:1">2:1</span> Now after this, David, questioning the
Lord, said, Am I to go up into any of the towns of Judah? And the Lord
said to him, Go up. And David said, Where am I to go? And he said, To
Hebron.

<span id="an_2:2">2:2</span> So David went there, taking with him his
two wives, Ahinoam of Jezreel, and Abigail, the wife of Nabal of Carmel.

<span id="an_2:3">2:3</span> And David took all his men with him, every
man with his family: and they were living in the towns round Hebron.

<span id="an_2:4">2:4</span> And the men of Judah came there, and with
the holy oil made David king over the people of Judah. And word came to
David that it was the men of Jabesh-gilead who put Saul's body in its
last resting-place.

<span id="an_2:5">2:5</span> And David sent to the men of Jabesh-gilead
and said to them, May the Lord give you his blessing, because you have
done this kind act to Saul your lord, and have put his body to rest!

<span id="an_2:6">2:6</span> May the Lord be good and true to you: and I
myself will see that your kind act is rewarded, because you have done
this thing.

<span id="an_2:7">2:7</span> Then let your hands be strong, and have no
fear: though Saul your lord is dead, the people of Judah have made me
their king.

<span id="an_2:8">2:8</span> Now Abner, the son of Ner, captain of
Saul's army, had taken Saul's son Ish-bosheth over to Mahanaim,

<span id="an_2:9">2:9</span> And made him king over Gilead and the
Asherites and over Jezreel and Ephraim and Benjamin, that is, over all
Israel.

<span id="an_2:10">2:10</span> (Saul's son Ish-bosheth was forty years
old when he became king over Israel, and he was ruler for two years.)
But Judah was on the side of David.

<span id="an_2:11">2:11</span> And the time when David was king in
Hebron over the people of Judah was seven years and six months.

<span id="an_2:12">2:12</span> And Abner, the son of Ner, with the
servants of Saul's son Ish-bosheth, went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon.

<span id="an_2:13">2:13</span> And Joab, the son of Zeruiah, and the
servants of David, went out and came face to face with them by the pool
of Gibeon; and they took up their position, facing one another on
opposite sides of the pool.

<span id="an_2:14">2:14</span> And Abner said to Joab, Let the young men
give a test of their strength before us. And Joab said, Let them do so.

<span id="an_2:15">2:15</span> So they got up and went over by number:
twelve for Benjamin and Ish-bosheth and twelve of the servants of David.

<span id="an_2:16">2:16</span> And every one got the other by the head,
driving his sword into the other's side, so they all went down together:
and that place was named the Field of Sides, and it is in Gibeon.

<span id="an_2:17">2:17</span> And there was hard fighting that day; and
Abner and the men of Israel gave way before the servants of David.

<span id="an_2:18">2:18</span> There were three sons of Zeruiah there,
Joab and Abishai and Asahel: and Asahel was as quick-footed as a roe of
the fields.

<span id="an_2:19">2:19</span> Asahel went running after Abner, not
turning to the right or to the left.

<span id="an_2:20">2:20</span> Then Abner, looking back, said, Is it
you, Asahel? And he said, It is I.

<span id="an_2:21">2:21</span> And Abner said, Then go to the right or
to the left and put your hands on one of the fighting-men and take his
arms. But Asahel would not be turned away from going after Abner.

<span id="an_2:22">2:22</span> Then again Abner said to Asahel, Go to
one side, do not keep on coming after me: why will you make me put an
end to you? for then I will be shamed before your brother Joab.

<span id="an_2:23">2:23</span> But still he did not go to one side: so
Abner gave him a back blow in the stomach with his spear, so that the
spear came out at his back; and he went down on the earth, wounded to
death: and all those who came to the place where Asahel went down dead,
came to a stop.

<span id="an_2:24">2:24</span> But Joab and Abishai went after Abner:
and the sun went down when they came to the hill of Ammah, which is to
the east of the road through the waste land of Geba.

<span id="an_2:25">2:25</span> And the men of Benjamin came together
after Abner in one band, and took their places on the top of a hill.

<span id="an_2:26">2:26</span> Then crying out to Joab, Abner said, Are
fighting and destruction to go on for ever? do you not see that the end
will only be bitter? how long will it be before you send the people back
and make them give up attacking their countrymen?

<span id="an_2:27">2:27</span> And Joab said, By the living God, if you
had not given the word, the people would have gone on attacking their
countrymen till the morning.

<span id="an_2:28">2:28</span> So Joab had a horn sounded, and all the
people came to a stop, and gave up going after Israel and fighting them.

<span id="an_2:29">2:29</span> And all that night Abner and his men went
through the Arabah; they went over Jordan and through all Bithron and
came to Mahanaim.

<span id="an_2:30">2:30</span> And Joab came back from fighting Abner:
and when he had got all his men together, it was seen that nineteen of
David's men, in addition to Asahel, were not with them.

<span id="an_2:31">2:31</span> But David's men had put to death three
hundred and sixty of the men of Benjamin and of Abner's men

<span id="an_2:32">2:32</span> And they took Asahel's body and put it in
the last resting-place of his father in Beth-lehem. And Joab and his
men, travelling all night, came to Hebron at dawn.

<span id="an_3:1">3:1</span> Now there was a long war between Saul's
people and David's people; and David became stronger and stronger, but
those on Saul's side became more and more feeble.

<span id="an_3:2">3:2</span> While David was in Hebron he became the
father of sons: the oldest was Amnon, son of Ahinoam of Jezreel;

<span id="an_3:3">3:3</span> And the second, Chileab, whose mother was
Abigail, the wife of Nabal the Carmelite; and the third, Absalom, son of
Maacah, the daughter of Talmai, king of Geshur;

<span id="an_3:4">3:4</span> And the fourth, Adonijah, the son of
Haggith; and the fifth, Shephatiah, the son of Abital;

<span id="an_3:5">3:5</span> And the sixth, Ithream, whose mother was
David's wife Eglah. These were the sons of David, whose birth took place
in Hebron.

<span id="an_3:6">3:6</span> Now while there was war between Saul's
people and David's people, Abner was making himself strong among the
supporters of Saul.

<span id="an_3:7">3:7</span> Now Saul had among his wives a woman named
Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah: and Ish-bosheth said to Abner, Why have
you taken my father's wife?

<span id="an_3:8">3:8</span> And Abner was very angry at the words of
Ish-bosheth, and he said, Am I a dog's head of Judah? I am this day
doing all in my power for the cause of your father Saul and for his
brothers and his friends, and have not given you up into the hands of
David, and now you say I have done wrong with a woman.

<span id="an_3:9">3:9</span> May God's punishment be on Abner, if I do
not for David as the Lord in his oath has said,

<span id="an_3:10">3:10</span> And if I do not take away the kingdom
from the family of Saul and make David ruler over Israel and Judah from
Dan as far as Beer-sheba!

<span id="an_3:11">3:11</span> And so great was Ish-bosheth's fear of
Abner that he was not able to say a word in answer.

<span id="an_3:12">3:12</span> And Abner sent men to David at Hebron,
saying, Make an agreement with me, and I will give you my support in
getting all Israel on your side.

<span id="an_3:13">3:13</span> And he said, It is well; I will make an
agreement with you, but on one condition, which is, that when you come
before me, Saul's daughter Michal is to come with you; till she comes
you will not see my face.

<span id="an_3:14">3:14</span> And David sent men to Saul's son
Ish-bosheth, saying, Give me back Michal, my wife, whom I made mine for
the price of the private parts of a hundred Philistines.

<span id="an_3:15">3:15</span> So Ish-bosheth sent and took her from her
husband Paltiel, the son of Laish.

<span id="an_3:16">3:16</span> And her husband went with her as far as
Bahurim, weeping while he went. Then Abner said to him, Go back. And he
went back.

<span id="an_3:17">3:17</span> Then Abner had a talk with the chief men
of Israel, saying, In the past it was your desire to make David your
king: so now, do it:

<span id="an_3:18">3:18</span> For the Lord has said of David, By the
hand of my servant David I will make my people Israel safe from the
Philistines, and from all who are against them.

<span id="an_3:19">3:19</span> And Abner said the same things to
Benjamin: and he went to David in Hebron to make clear to him what
seemed good to Israel and to all the people of Benjamin.

<span id="an_3:20">3:20</span> So Abner, with twenty men, came to
Hebron, to David. And David made a feast for Abner and the men who were
with him.

<span id="an_3:21">3:21</span> And Abner said to David, Now I will go,
and make all Israel come to my lord the king, so that they may make an
agreement with you, and your kingdom may be as wide as your heart's
desire. Then David sent Abner away and he went in peace.

<span id="an_3:22">3:22</span> Now the servants of David and Joab had
been out attacking a band of armed men, and they came back with a great
store of goods taken in the fight: but Abner was no longer in Hebron
with David, for he had sent him away and he had gone in peace.

<span id="an_3:23">3:23</span> When Joab and his men came, news was
given them that Abner, the son of Ner, had come to the king, who had let
him go away again in peace.

<span id="an_3:24">3:24</span> Then Joab came to the king, and said,
What have you done? when Abner came to you why did you send him away and
let him go?

<span id="an_3:25">3:25</span> Is it not clear to you that Abner, the
son of Ner, came with deceit to get knowledge of your going out and your
coming in and of all you are doing?

<span id="an_3:26">3:26</span> And when Joab had come out from David, he
sent men after Abner, and they overtook him at the water-spring of
Sirah, and made him come back with them: but David had no knowledge of
it.

<span id="an_3:27">3:27</span> And when Abner was back in Hebron, Joab
took him on one side by the doorway of the town to have a word with him
quietly, and there he gave him a wound in the stomach, causing his death
in payment for the death of his brother Asahel.

<span id="an_3:28">3:28</span> And when David had word of it he said,
May I and my kingdom be clear for ever in the eyes of the Lord from the
blood of Abner, the son of Ner:

<span id="an_3:29">3:29</span> May it come on the head of Joab and all
his father's family: among the men of Joab's family may there ever be
some who are diseased or lepers, or who do the work of women, or are put
to the sword, or are wasted from need of food!

<span id="an_3:30">3:30</span> So Joab and Abishai his brother put Abner
to death, because he had put to death their brother Asahel in the fight
at Gibeon.

<span id="an_3:31">3:31</span> And David said to Joab and all the people
who were with him, Go in grief and put haircloth about you, in sorrow
for Abner. And King David went after the dead body.

<span id="an_3:32">3:32</span> And they put Abner's body to rest in
Hebron; and the king and all the people were weeping loudly by the
resting-place of Abner's body.

<span id="an_3:33">3:33</span> And the king made a song of grief for
Abner and said, Was the death of Abner to be like the death of a foolish
man?

<span id="an_3:34">3:34</span> Your hands were free, your feet were not
chained: like the downfall of a man before evil men, so was your fall.
And the weeping of the people over him went on again.

<span id="an_3:35">3:35</span> And the people came to make David take
food, while it was still day, but David with an oath said, May God's
punishment be on me if I take a taste of bread or any other thing till
the sun has gone down!

<span id="an_3:36">3:36</span> And all the people took note of it and
were pleased: like everything the king did, it was pleasing to the
people.

<span id="an_3:37">3:37</span> So it was clear to Israel and to all the
people on that day that the king was not responsible for the death of
Abner, the son of Ner.

<span id="an_3:38">3:38</span> And the king said to his servants, Do you
not see that a chief and a great man has come to his end today in
Israel?

<span id="an_3:39">3:39</span> While I, though I am crowned king, have
little strength, and these men, the sons of Zeruiah, are out of my
control: may the Lord give to the evil-doer the reward of his
evil-doing!

<span id="an_4:1">4:1</span> And when Saul's son Ish-bosheth had news
that Abner was dead in Hebron, his hands became feeble, and all the
Israelites were troubled.

<span id="an_4:2">4:2</span> And Saul's son had two men, captains of
bands, one named Baanah and the other Rechab, sons of Rimmon the
Beerothite, of the tribe of Benjamin; (for Beeroth was at one time taken
to be part of Benjamin:

<span id="an_4:3">4:3</span> But the people of Beeroth had gone in
flight to Gittaim, where they have been living to this day.)

<span id="an_4:4">4:4</span> Now Jonathan, Saul's son, had a son whose
feet were damaged. He was five years old when news of the death of Saul
and Jonathan came from Jezreel, and the woman who took care of him took
him up and went in flight: and while she was getting him away as quickly
as she was able, he had a fall and his feet were damaged. His name was
Mephibosheth.

<span id="an_4:5">4:5</span> And Rechab and Baanah, the sons of Rimmon
the Beerothite, went out and came to the house of Ish-bosheth in the
heat of the day, when he was resting in the middle of the day. Now the
woman who kept the door was cleaning grain, and sleep overcame her.

<span id="an_4:6">4:6</span> And Rechab and his brother Baanah got in
without being seen.

<span id="an_4:7">4:7</span> And when they came into the house,
Ish-bosheth was stretched on his bed in his bedroom; and they made an
attack on him and put him to death, and, cutting off his head, they took
it with them and went by the road through the Arabah all night.

<span id="an_4:8">4:8</span> And they took the head of Ish-bosheth to
David in Hebron, and said to the king, Here is the head of Ish-bosheth,
the son of Saul your hater, who would have taken your life; the Lord has
taken payment for the wrongs of my lord the king from Saul and his seed
today.

<span id="an_4:9">4:9</span> And David made answer to Rechab and his
brother Baanah, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, and said to them, By
the living Lord, who has kept me safe from all my trouble,

<span id="an_4:10">4:10</span> When one came to me with the news of
Saul's death, in the belief that it would be good news, I took him and
put him to death in Ziklag, which was the reward I gave him for his
news:

<span id="an_4:11">4:11</span> How much more, when evil men have put an
upright person to death, in his house, sleeping on his bed, will I take
payment from you for his blood, and have you cut off from the earth?

<span id="an_4:12">4:12</span> And David gave orders to his young men
and they put them to death, cutting off their hands and their feet and
hanging them up by the side of the pool in Hebron. But they took the
head of Ish-bosheth and put it in its last resting-place with Abner's
body in Hebron.

<span id="an_5:1">5:1</span> Then all the tribes of Israel came to David
in Hebron and said, Truly, we are your bone and your flesh.

<span id="an_5:2">5:2</span> In the past when Saul was king over us, it
was you who went at the head of Israel when they went out or came in:
and the Lord said to you, You are to be the keeper of my people Israel
and their ruler.

<span id="an_5:3">5:3</span> So all the responsible men of Israel came
to the king at Hebron; and King David made an agreement with them in
Hebron before the Lord: and they put the holy oil on David and made him
king over Israel.

<span id="an_5:4">5:4</span> David was thirty years old when he became
king, and he was king for forty years,

<span id="an_5:5">5:5</span> Ruling over Judah in Hebron for seven years
and six months, and in Jerusalem, over all Israel and Judah, for
thirty-three years.

<span id="an_5:6">5:6</span> And the king and his men went to Jerusalem
against the Jebusites, the people of the land: and they said to David,
You will not come in here, but the blind and the feeble-footed will keep
you out; for they said, David will not be able to come in here.

<span id="an_5:7">5:7</span> But David took the strong place of Zion,
which is the town of David.

<span id="an_5:8">5:8</span> And that day David said, Whoever makes an
attack on the Jebusites, let him go up by the water-pipe, and put to
death all the blind and feeble-footed who are hated by David. And this
is why they say, The blind and feeble-footed may not come into the
house.

<span id="an_5:9">5:9</span> So David took the strong tower for his
living-place, naming it the town of David. And David took in hand the
building of the town all round, starting from the Millo.

<span id="an_5:10">5:10</span> And David became greater and greater; for
the Lord, the God of armies, was with him.

<span id="an_5:11">5:11</span> And Hiram, king of Tyre, sent men to
David, with cedar-trees and woodworkers and stoneworkers: and they made
David a house.

<span id="an_5:12">5:12</span> And David saw that the Lord had made his
position safe as king over Israel, and that he had made his kingdom
great because of his people Israel.

<span id="an_5:13">5:13</span> And David took more women and wives in
Jerusalem, after he had come from Hebron: and he had more sons and
daughters.

<span id="an_5:14">5:14</span> These are the names of those whose birth
took place in Jerusalem: Shammua and Shobab and Nathan and Solomon

<span id="an_5:15">5:15</span> And Ibhar and Elishua and Nepheg and
Japhia

<span id="an_5:16">5:16</span> And Elishama and Eliada and Eliphelet.

<span id="an_5:17">5:17</span> And when the Philistines had news that
David had been made king over Israel, they all went up in search of
David; and David, hearing of it, went down to the strong place.

<span id="an_5:18">5:18</span> And when the Philistines came, they went
in every direction in the valley of Rephaim.

<span id="an_5:19">5:19</span> And David, desiring directions from the
Lord, said, Am I to go up against the Philistines? will you give them up
into my hands? And the Lord said, Go up, for I will certainly give up
the Philistines into your hands.

<span id="an_5:20">5:20</span> And David went to Baal-perazim, and
overcame them there; and he said, The Lord has let the forces fighting
against me be broken before me as a wall is broken by rushing waters. So
that place was named Baal-perazim.

<span id="an_5:21">5:21</span> And the Philistines, when they went in
flight, did not take their images with them, and David and his men took
them away.

<span id="an_5:22">5:22</span> And the Philistines came up again, and
went in every direction in the valley of Rephaim.

<span id="an_5:23">5:23</span> And when David went for directions to the
Lord, he said, You are not to go up against them in front; but make a
circle round them from the back and come on them opposite the
spice-trees.

<span id="an_5:24">5:24</span> Then at the sound of footsteps in the
tops of the trees, go forward quickly, for the Lord has gone out before
you to overcome the army of the Philistines.

<span id="an_5:25">5:25</span> And David did as the Lord had said; and
he overcame the Philistines, attacking them from Gibeon to near Gezer.

<span id="an_6:1">6:1</span> And David got together all the fighting-men
of Israel to the number of thirty thousand;

<span id="an_6:2">6:2</span> And David, and all the people who were with
him, went to Baal of Judah to get the ark of God, over which the holy
name is named, the name of the Lord of armies, whose place is between
the winged ones.

<span id="an_6:3">6:3</span> And they put the ark of God on a new cart
and took it out of the house of Abinadab which was on the hill: and
Uzzah and Ahio, the sons of Abinadab, were the drivers of the cart.

<span id="an_6:4">6:4</span> And Uzzah went by the side of the ark,
while Ahio went before it.

<span id="an_6:5">6:5</span> And David and all the men of Israel made
melody before the Lord with all their power, with songs and with corded
instruments and instruments of brass.

<span id="an_6:6">6:6</span> And when they came to Nacon's grain-floor,
Uzzah put his hand on the ark of God to keep it safe in its place, for
the oxen were out of control.

<span id="an_6:7">6:7</span> And the wrath of the Lord, burning against
Uzzah, sent destruction on him because he had put his hand on the ark,
and death came to him there by the ark of God.

<span id="an_6:8">6:8</span> And David was angry because of the Lord's
outburst of wrath against Uzzah: and he gave that place the name
Perez-uzzah, which is its name to this day.

<span id="an_6:9">6:9</span> And such was David's fear of the Lord that
day, that he said, How may I let the ark of God come to me?

<span id="an_6:10">6:10</span> So David did not let the ark of the Lord
come back to him to the town of David: but had it turned away and put
into the house of Obed-edom the Gittite.

<span id="an_6:11">6:11</span> And the ark of the Lord was in the house
of Obed-edom the Gittite for three months: and the Lord sent a blessing
on Obed-edom and all his family.

<span id="an_6:12">6:12</span> And they said to King David, The blessing
of the Lord is on the family of Obed-edom and on all he has, because of
the ark of God. And David went and took the ark of God from the house of
Obed-edom into the town of David with joy.

<span id="an_6:13">6:13</span> And when those who were lifting the ark
of the Lord had gone six steps, he made an offering of an ox and a fat
young beast.

<span id="an_6:14">6:14</span> And David, clothed in a linen ephod, was
dancing before the Lord with all his strength.

<span id="an_6:15">6:15</span> So David and all the men of Israel took
up the ark of the Lord with cries of joy and sounding of horns.

<span id="an_6:16">6:16</span> And when the ark of the Lord came into
the town of David, Michal, Saul's daughter, looking out of the window,
saw King David dancing and jumping before the Lord; and to her mind he
seemed foolish.

<span id="an_6:17">6:17</span> And they took in the ark of the Lord, and
put it in its place inside the tent which David had put up for it: and
David made burned offerings and peace-offerings to the Lord.

<span id="an_6:18">6:18</span> And after David had made the burned
offerings and the peace-offerings, he gave the people a blessing in the
name of the Lord of armies.

<span id="an_6:19">6:19</span> And he gave to every man and woman among
all the people, among all the masses of Israel, a cake of bread and a
measure of wine and a cake of dry grapes. Then all the people went away,
every man to his house.

<span id="an_6:20">6:20</span> Then David came back to give a blessing
to his family. And Michal, Saul's daughter, came out to him and said,
How full of glory was the king of Israel today, who let himself be seen
uncovered by his servant-girls like a foolish person uncovering himself
without shame!

<span id="an_6:21">6:21</span> And David said to Michal, I was dancing
before the Lord, who put me over your father and all his sons, to make
me a ruler over the people of the Lord, over his people Israel: and I
will go on playing before the Lord;

<span id="an_6:22">6:22</span> And I will do even worse than this, and
make myself even lower in your eyes: but the servant-girls of whom you
were talking will give me honour.

<span id="an_6:23">6:23</span> And Michal, Saul's daughter, had no child
till the day of her death.

<span id="an_7:1">7:1</span> Now when the king was living in his house,
and the Lord had given him rest from war on every side;

<span id="an_7:2">7:2</span> The king said to Nathan the prophet, See
now, I am living in a house of cedar, but the ark of God is housed
inside the curtains of a tent.

<span id="an_7:3">7:3</span> And Nathan said to the king, Go and do
whatever is in your heart; for the Lord is with you.

<span id="an_7:4">7:4</span> Now that night the word of the Lord came to
Nathan, saying,

<span id="an_7:5">7:5</span> Go and say to my servant David, The Lord
says, Are you to be the builder of a house, a living-place for me?

<span id="an_7:6">7:6</span> For from the day when I took the children
of Israel up out of Egypt till this day, I have had no house, but have
gone from place to place in a tent.

<span id="an_7:7">7:7</span> In all the places where I went with all the
children of Israel, did I ever say to any of the judges of Israel, to
whom I gave the care of my people Israel, Why have you not made me a
house of cedar?

<span id="an_7:8">7:8</span> Then say these words to my servant David,
The Lord of armies says, I took you from the fields, from keeping the
sheep, so that you might be a ruler over my people, over my people
Israel:

<span id="an_7:9">7:9</span> And I have been with you wherever you went,
cutting off before you all those who were against you; and I will make
your name great, like the name of the greatest ones of the earth.

<span id="an_7:10">7:10</span> And I will make a resting-place for my
people Israel, planting them there, so that they may be living in the
place which is theirs, and never again be moved; and never again will
they be troubled by evil men as they were at the first,

<span id="an_7:11">7:11</span> From the time when I put judges over my
people Israel; and I will give you peace from all who are against you.
And the Lord says to you that he will make you the head of a line of
kings.

<span id="an_7:12">7:12</span> And when the time comes for you to go to
rest with your fathers, I will put in your place your seed after you,
the offspring of your body, and I will make his kingdom strong.

<span id="an_7:13">7:13</span> He will be the builder of a house for my
name, and I will make the seat of his authority certain for ever.

<span id="an_7:14">7:14</span> I will be to him a father and he will be
to me a son: if he does wrong, I will give him punishment with the rod
of men and with the blows of the children of men;

<span id="an_7:15">7:15</span> But my mercy will not be taken away from
him, as I took it from him who was before you.

<span id="an_7:16">7:16</span> And your family and your kingdom will
keep their place before me for ever: the seat of your authority will
never be overturned.

<span id="an_7:17">7:17</span> So Nathan gave David an account of all
these words and this vision.

<span id="an_7:18">7:18</span> Then David the king went in and took his
seat before the Lord, and said, Who am I, O Lord God, and what is my
family, that you have been my guide till now?

<span id="an_7:19">7:19</span> And this was only a small thing to you, O
Lord God; but your words have even been about the far-off future of your
servant's family, O Lord God!

<span id="an_7:20">7:20</span> What more may David say to you? for you
have knowledge of your servant, O Lord God.

<span id="an_7:21">7:21</span> Because of your word and from your heart,
you have done all this great work, and let your servant see it.

<span id="an_7:22">7:22</span> Truly you are great, O Lord God: there is
no one like you and no other God but you, as is clear from everything
which has come to our ears.

<span id="an_7:23">7:23</span> And what other nation in the earth, like
your people Israel, did a god go out to take for himself, to be his
people, and to make a name for himself, and to do great and strange
things for them, driving out a nation and its gods from before his
people?

<span id="an_7:24">7:24</span> But you took and made strong for yourself
your people Israel, to be your people for ever; and you, Lord, became
their God.

<span id="an_7:25">7:25</span> And now, O Lord God, may the word which
you have said about your servant and about his family, be made certain
for ever, and may you do as you have said!

<span id="an_7:26">7:26</span> And let your name be made great for ever,
and let men say, The Lord of armies is God over Israel: and let the
family of David your servant be made strong before you!

<span id="an_7:27">7:27</span> For you, O Lord of armies, the God of
Israel, have clearly said to your servant, I will make you the head of a
family of kings: and so it has come into your servant's heart to make
this prayer to you.

<span id="an_7:28">7:28</span> And now, O Lord God, you are God and your
words are true and you have said you will give your servant this good
thing;

<span id="an_7:29">7:29</span> So may it be your pleasure to give your
blessing to the family of your servant, so that it may go on for ever
before you: (for you, O Lord God, have said it,) and may your blessing
be on your servant's family line for ever!

<span id="an_8:1">8:1</span> And it came about after this that David
made an attack on the Philistines and overcame them; and David took the
authority of the mother-town from the hands of the Philistines.

<span id="an_8:2">8:2</span> And he overcame the Moabites, and he had
them measured with a line when they were stretched out on the earth;
marking out two lines for death and one full line for life. So the
Moabites became servants to David and gave him offerings.

<span id="an_8:3">8:3</span> And David overcame Hadadezer, the son of
Rehob, king of Zobah, when he went to make his power seen by the River.

<span id="an_8:4">8:4</span> And David took from him one thousand, seven
hundred horsemen and twenty thousand footmen: and David had the
leg-muscles of the horses cut, only keeping enough of them for a hundred
war-carriages.

<span id="an_8:5">8:5</span> And when the Aramaeans of Damascus came to
the help of Hadadezer, king of Zobah, David put to the sword twenty-two
thousand of the Aramaeans.

<span id="an_8:6">8:6</span> And David put armed forces in Aram of
Damascus: and the Aramaeans became servants to David and gave him
offerings. And the Lord made David overcome wherever he went.

<span id="an_8:7">8:7</span> And David took their gold body-covers from
the servants of Hadadezer and took them to Jerusalem.

<span id="an_8:8">8:8</span> And from Tebah and Berothai, towns of
Hadadezer, King David took a great store of brass.

<span id="an_8:9">8:9</span> And when Tou, king of Hamath, had news that
David had overcome all the army of Hadadezer,

<span id="an_8:10">8:10</span> He sent his son Hadoram to David, with
words of peace and blessing, because he had overcome Hadadezer in the
fight, for Hadadezer had wars with Tou; and Hadoram took with him
vessels of silver and gold and brass:

<span id="an_8:11">8:11</span> These King David made holy to the Lord,
together with the silver and gold which he had taken from the nations he
had overcome--

<span id="an_8:12">8:12</span> The nations of Edom and Moab, and the
children of Ammon and the Philistines and the Amalekites and the goods
he had taken from Hadadezer, the son of Rehob, king of Zobah.

<span id="an_8:13">8:13</span> And David got great honour for himself,
when he came back, by the destruction of Edom in the valley of Salt, to
the number of eighteen thousand men.

<span id="an_8:14">8:14</span> And he put armed forces in Edom; all
through Edom he had armed forces stationed, and all the Edomites became
servants to David. And the Lord made David overcome wherever he went.

<span id="an_8:15">8:15</span> And David was king over all Israel,
judging and giving right decisions for all his people.

<span id="an_8:16">8:16</span> And Joab, the son of Zeruiah, was chief
of the army; and Jehoshaphat, the son of Ahilud, was keeper of the
records;

<span id="an_8:17">8:17</span> And Zadok and Abiathar, the son of
Ahimelech, the son of Ahitub, were priests; and Seraiah was the scribe;

<span id="an_8:18">8:18</span> And Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, was
over the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and David's sons were priests.

<span id="an_9:1">9:1</span> And David said, Is there still anyone of
Saul's family living, so that I may be a friend to him, because of
Jonathan?

<span id="an_9:2">9:2</span> Now there was of Saul's people a servant
named Ziba, and they sent him to David; and the king said to him, Are
you Ziba? And he said, I am.

<span id="an_9:3">9:3</span> And the king said, Is there anyone of
Saul's family still living, to whom I may be a friend in God's name? And
Ziba said, There is a son of Jonathan, whose feet are damaged.

<span id="an_9:4">9:4</span> And the king said to him, Where is he? And
Ziba said to the king, He is in the house of Machir, the son of Ammiel,
in Lo-debar.

<span id="an_9:5">9:5</span> Then King David sent, and had him taken
from Lo-debar, from the house of Machir, the son of Ammiel.

<span id="an_9:6">9:6</span> And Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan, came
to David, and falling down on his face, gave him honour. And David said,
Mephibosheth. And answering he said, Your servant is here.

<span id="an_9:7">9:7</span> And David said to him, Have no fear: for
truly I will be good to you, because of your father Jonathan, and I will
give back to you all the land which was Saul's; and you will have a
place at my table at all times.

<span id="an_9:8">9:8</span> And he went down on his face before the
king, and said, What is your servant, for you to take note of a dead dog
such as I am?

<span id="an_9:9">9:9</span> Then the king sent for Ziba, Saul's
servant, and said to him, All the property of Saul and of his family I
have given to your master's son.

<span id="an_9:10">9:10</span> And you and your sons and your servants
are to take care of the land for him, and get in the fruit of it, so
that your master's son may have food: but Mephibosheth, your master's
son, will have a place at my table at all times. Now Ziba had fifteen
sons and twenty servants.

<span id="an_9:11">9:11</span> Then Ziba said to the king, Every order
which you have given to your servant will be done. As for Mephibosheth,
he had a place at David's table, like one of the king's sons.

<span id="an_9:12">9:12</span> And Mephibosheth had a young son named
Mica. And all the people living in the house of Ziba were servants to
Mephibosheth.

<span id="an_9:13">9:13</span> So Mephibosheth went on living in
Jerusalem; for he took all his meals at the king's table; and he had not
the use of his feet.

<span id="an_10:1">10:1</span> Now after this, death came to the king of
the children of Ammon, and Hanun, his son, became king in his place.

<span id="an_10:2">10:2</span> And David said, I will be a friend to
Hanun, the son of Nahash, as his father was a friend to me. So David
sent his servants, to give him words of comfort on account of his
father. And David's servants came into the land of the children of
Ammon.

<span id="an_10:3">10:3</span> But the chiefs of the children of Ammon
said to Hanun their lord, Does it seem to you that David is honouring
your father by sending comforters to you? has he not sent his servants
to go through the town and make secret observation of it, and overcome
it?

<span id="an_10:4">10:4</span> So Hanun took David's servants, and after
cutting off half the hair on their chins, and cutting off the skirts of
their robes up to the middle, he sent them away.

<span id="an_10:5">10:5</span> When David had news of it, he sent men
out with the purpose of meeting them on their way, for the men were
greatly shamed: and the king said, Go to Jericho till your hair is long
again, and then come back.

<span id="an_10:6">10:6</span> And when the children of Ammon saw that
they had made themselves hated by David, they sent to the Aramaeans of
Beth-rehob and Zobah, and got for payment twenty thousand footmen, and
they got from the king of Maacah a thousand men, and from Tob twelve
thousand.

<span id="an_10:7">10:7</span> And hearing of this, David sent Joab and
all the army and the best fighting-men.

<span id="an_10:8">10:8</span> And the children of Ammon came out and
put their forces in position at the way into the town: and the Aramaeans
of Zobah and of Rehob, with the men of Tob and Maacah, were by
themselves in the field.

<span id="an_10:9">10:9</span> Now when Joab saw that their forces were
in position against him in front and at his back, he took the best of
the men of Israel and put them in line against the Aramaeans;

<span id="an_10:10">10:10</span> And the rest of the people he put in
position against the children of Ammon, with Abishai, his brother, at
their head.

<span id="an_10:11">10:11</span> And he said, If the Aramaeans are
stronger and get the better of me, then you are to come to my help; but
if the children of Ammon get the better of you, I will come to your
help.

<span id="an_10:12">10:12</span> Take heart, and let us be strong for
our people and for the towns of our God, and may the Lord do what seems
good to him.

<span id="an_10:13">10:13</span> Then Joab and the people with him went
forward to the fight against the Aramaeans, and they went in flight
before him.

<span id="an_10:14">10:14</span> And when the children of Ammon saw the
flight of the Aramaeans, they themselves went in flight from Abishai,
and came into the town. So Joab went back from fighting the children of
Ammon and came to Jerusalem.

<span id="an_10:15">10:15</span> And when the Aramaeans saw that Israel
had overcome them, they got themselves together.

<span id="an_10:16">10:16</span> And Hadadezer sent for the Aramaeans
who were on the other side of the River: and they came to Helam, with
Shobach, the captain of Hadadezer's army, at their head.

<span id="an_10:17">10:17</span> And word of this was given to David:
and he got all Israel together and went over Jordan and came to Helam.
And the Aramaeans put their forces in position against David, and made
an attack on him.

<span id="an_10:18">10:18</span> And the Aramaeans went in flight before
Israel; and David put to the sword the men of seven hundred Aramaean
war-carriages and forty thousand footmen, and Shobach, the captain of
the army, was wounded, and came to his death there.

<span id="an_10:19">10:19</span> And when all the kings who were
servants of Hadadezer saw that they were overcome by Israel, they made
peace with Israel and became their servants. So the Aramaeans, in fear,
gave no more help to the children of Ammon.

<span id="an_11:1">11:1</span> Now in the spring, at the time when kings
go out to war, David sent Joab and his servants and all Israel with him;
and they made waste the land of the children of Ammon, and took up their
position before Rabbah, shutting it in. But David was still at
Jerusalem.

<span id="an_11:2">11:2</span> Now one evening, David got up from his
bed, and while he was walking on the roof of the king's house, he saw
from there a woman bathing; and the woman was very beautiful.

<span id="an_11:3">11:3</span> And David sent to get knowledge who the
woman was. And one said, Is this not Bath-sheba, the daughter of Eliam
and wife of Uriah the Hittite?

<span id="an_11:4">11:4</span> And David sent and took her; and she came
to him, and he took her to his bed: (for she had been made clean;) then
she went back to her house.

<span id="an_11:5">11:5</span> And the woman became with child; and she
sent word to David that she was with child.

<span id="an_11:6">11:6</span> And David sent to Joab saying, Send Uriah
the Hittite to me. And Joab sent Uriah to David.

<span id="an_11:7">11:7</span> And when Uriah came to him, David put
questions to him about how Joab and the people were, and how the war was
going.

<span id="an_11:8">11:8</span> And David said to Uriah, Go down to your
house and let your feet be washed. And Uriah went away from the king's
house, and an offering from the king was sent after him.

<span id="an_11:9">11:9</span> But Uriah took his rest at the door of
the king's house, with all the servants of his lord, and did not go down
to his house.

<span id="an_11:10">11:10</span> And when word was given to David that
Uriah had not gone down to his house, David said to Uriah, Have you not
come from a journey? why did you not go down to your house?

<span id="an_11:11">11:11</span> And Uriah said to David, Israel and
Judah with the ark are living in tents, and my lord Joab and the other
servants of my lord are sleeping in the open field; and am I to go to my
house and take food and drink, and go to bed with my wife? By the living
Lord, and by the life of your soul, I will not do such a thing.

<span id="an_11:12">11:12</span> And David said to Uriah, Be here today,
and after that I will let you go. So Uriah was in Jerusalem that day and
the day after.

<span id="an_11:13">11:13</span> And when David sent for him, he took
meat and drink with him, and David made him the worse for drink: and
when evening came, he went to rest on his bed with the servants of his
lord, but he did not go down to his house.

<span id="an_11:14">11:14</span> Now in the morning, David gave Uriah a
letter to take to Joab.

<span id="an_11:15">11:15</span> And in the letter he said, Take care to
put Uriah in the very front of the line, where the fighting is most
violent, and go back from him, so that he may be overcome and put to
death.

<span id="an_11:16">11:16</span> So while Joab was watching the town, he
put Uriah in the place where it was clear to him the best fighters were.

<span id="an_11:17">11:17</span> And the men of the town went out and
had a fight with Joab: and a number of David's men came to their death
in the fight, and with them Uriah the Hittite.

<span id="an_11:18">11:18</span> Then Joab sent David news of everything
which had taken place in the war:

<span id="an_11:19">11:19</span> And he gave orders to the man who took
the news, saying, After you have given the king all the news about the
war,

<span id="an_11:20">11:20</span> If the king is angry and says, Why did
you go so near the town for the fight? was it not certain that their
archers would be on the wall?

<span id="an_11:21">11:21</span> Who put Abimelech, the son of
Jerubbaal, to death? did not a woman send a great stone down on him from
the wall, putting him to death at Thebez? why did you go so near the
wall? Then say to him, Your servant Uriah the Hittite is among the dead.

<span id="an_11:22">11:22</span> So the man went, and came to David, and
gave him all the news which Joab had sent him to give; then David was
angry with Joab and said, Why did you go so near the town for the fight?
was it not certain that their archers would be on the wall? who put
Abimelech, the son of Jerubbaal, to death? did not a woman send a great
stone down on him from the wall, putting him to death at Thebez? why did
you go so near the wall?

<span id="an_11:23">11:23</span> And the man said to David, Truly the
men got the better of us, and came out against us into the open country,
but we sent them back to the very doors of the town.

<span id="an_11:24">11:24</span> And the archers sent their arrows at
your servants from the wall, and some of the king's servants are dead,
and among them is your servant Uriah the Hittite.

<span id="an_11:25">11:25</span> Then David said to the man, Go and say
to Joab, Do not let this be a grief to you; for one man may come to his
death by the sword like another: put up an even stronger fight against
the town, and take it: and do you put heart into him.

<span id="an_11:26">11:26</span> And when the wife of Uriah had news
that her husband was dead, she gave herself up to weeping for him.

<span id="an_11:27">11:27</span> And when the days of weeping were past,
David sent for her, and took her into his house, and she became his wife
and gave him a son. But the Lord was not pleased with the thing David
had done.

<span id="an_12:1">12:1</span> And the Lord sent Nathan to David. And
Nathan came to him and said, There were two men in the same town: one a
man of great wealth, and the other a poor man.

<span id="an_12:2">12:2</span> The man of wealth had great numbers of
flocks and herds;

<span id="an_12:3">12:3</span> But the poor man had only one little
she-lamb, which he had got and taken care of: from its birth it had been
with him like one of his children; his meat was its food, and from his
cup it took its drink, resting in his arms, and it was like a daughter
to him.

<span id="an_12:4">12:4</span> Now a traveller came to the house of the
man of wealth, but he would not take anything from his flock or his herd
to make a meal for the traveller who had come to him, but he took the
poor man's lamb and made it ready for the man who had come.

<span id="an_12:5">12:5</span> And David was full of wrath against that
man; and he said to Nathan, By the living Lord, death is the right
punishment for the man who has done this:

<span id="an_12:6">12:6</span> And he will have to give back four times
the value of the lamb, because he has done this and because he had no
pity.

<span id="an_12:7">12:7</span> And Nathan said to David, You are that
man. The Lord God of Israel says, I made you king over Israel, putting
holy oil on you, and I kept you safe from the hands of Saul;

<span id="an_12:8">12:8</span> I gave you your master's daughter and
your master's wives for yourself, and I gave you the daughters of Israel
and Judah; and if that had not been enough, I would have given you such
and such things.

<span id="an_12:9">12:9</span> Why then have you had no respect for the
word of the Lord, doing what is evil in his eyes? You have put Uriah the
Hittite to death with the sword, and have taken his wife to be your
wife; you have put him to death with the sword of the children of Ammon.

<span id="an_12:10">12:10</span> So now the sword will never be turned
away from your family; because you have had no respect for me, and have
taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be your wife.

<span id="an_12:11">12:11</span> The Lord says, From those of your
family I will send evil against you, and before your very eyes I will
take your wives and give them to your neighbour, and he will take your
wives to his bed by the light of this sun.

<span id="an_12:12">12:12</span> You did it secretly; but I will do this
thing before all Israel and in the light of the sun.

<span id="an_12:13">12:13</span> And David said to Nathan, Great is my
sin against the Lord. And Nathan said to David, The Lord has put away
your sin; death will not come on you.

<span id="an_12:14">12:14</span> But still, because you have had no
respect for the Lord, death will certainly overtake the child who has
newly come to birth.

<span id="an_12:15">12:15</span> Then Nathan went back to his house. And
the hand of the Lord was on David's son, the child of Uriah's wife, and
it became very ill.

<span id="an_12:16">12:16</span> So David made prayer to God for the
child; and he took no food day after day, and went in and, stretching
himself out on the earth, was there all night.

<span id="an_12:17">12:17</span> And the chief men of his house got up
and went to his side to make him get up from the earth, but he would
not; and he would not take food with them.

<span id="an_12:18">12:18</span> And then on the seventh day the child's
death took place. And David's servants were in fear of giving him the
news of the child's death: for they said, Truly, while the child was
still living he gave no attention when we said anything to him: what
will he do to himself if we give him word that the child is dead?

<span id="an_12:19">12:19</span> But when David saw that his servants
were talking together quietly, he was certain that the child was dead:
and he said to his servants, Is the child dead? and they said, He is.

<span id="an_12:20">12:20</span> Then David got up from the earth, and
after washing and rubbing himself with oil and changing his clothing, he
went into the house of the Lord and gave worship: then he went back to
his house, and at his order they put food before him and he had a meal.

<span id="an_12:21">12:21</span> Then his servants said to him, Why have
you been acting in this way? you were weeping and going without food
while the child was still living; but when the child was dead, you got
up and had a meal.

<span id="an_12:22">12:22</span> And he said, While the child was still
living I went without food and gave myself up to weeping: for I said,
Who is able to say that the Lord will not have mercy on me and give the
child life?

<span id="an_12:23">12:23</span> But now that the child is dead there is
no reason for me to go without food; am I able to make him come back to
life? I will go to him, but he will never come back to me.

<span id="an_12:24">12:24</span> And David gave comfort to his wife
Bath-sheba, and he went in to her and had connection with her: and she
had a son to whom she gave the name Solomon. And he was dear to the
Lord.

<span id="an_12:25">12:25</span> And he sent word by Nathan the prophet,
who gave him the name Jedidiah, by the word of the Lord.

<span id="an_12:26">12:26</span> Now Joab was fighting against Rabbah,
in the land of the children of Ammon, and he took the water-town.

<span id="an_12:27">12:27</span> And Joab sent men to David, saying, I
have made war against Rabbah and have taken the water-town.

<span id="an_12:28">12:28</span> So now, get the rest of the people
together, and put them in position against the town and take it, for if
I take it, it will be named after my name.

<span id="an_12:29">12:29</span> Then David got all the people together
and went to Rabbah and made war on it and took it.

<span id="an_12:30">12:30</span> And he took the crown of Milcom from
his head; the weight of it was a talent of gold, and in it were stones
of great price; and it was put on David's head. And he took a great
store of goods from the town.

<span id="an_12:31">12:31</span> And he took the people out of the town
and put them to work with wood-cutting instruments, and iron
grain-crushers, and iron axes, and at brick-making: this he did to all
the towns of the children of Ammon. Then David and all the people went
back to Jerusalem.

<span id="an_13:1">13:1</span> Now after this, it came about that
Absalom, David's son, had a beautiful sister, whose name was Tamar; and
David's son Amnon was in love with her.

<span id="an_13:2">13:2</span> And he was so deeply in love that he
became ill because of his sister Tamar; for she was a virgin, and so it
seemed hard to Amnon to do anything to her.

<span id="an_13:3">13:3</span> But Amnon had a friend whose name was
Jonadab, the son of Shimeah, David's brother: and Jonadab was a very
wise man.

<span id="an_13:4">13:4</span> And he said to him, O son of the king,
why are you getting thinner day by day? will you not say what your
trouble is? And Amnon said to him, I am in love with Tamar, my brother
Absalom's sister.

<span id="an_13:5">13:5</span> Then Jonadab said to him, Go to your bed,
and let it seem that you are ill: and when your father comes to see you,
say to him, Let my sister Tamar come and give me bread, and get the food
ready before my eyes, so that I may see it and take it from her hand.

<span id="an_13:6">13:6</span> So Amnon went to bed and made himself
seem ill: and when the king came to see him, Amnon said to the king,
Please let my sister Tamar come and make me one or two cakes before my
eyes, so that I may take food from her hand.

<span id="an_13:7">13:7</span> Then David sent to the house for Tamar
and said, Go now to your brother Amnon's house and get a meal for him.

<span id="an_13:8">13:8</span> So Tamar went to her brother Amnon's
house; and he was in bed. And she took paste and made cakes before his
eyes, cooking them over the fire.

<span id="an_13:9">13:9</span> And she took the cooking-pot, and put the
cakes before him, but he would not take them. And Amnon said, Let
everyone go away from me. So they all went out.

<span id="an_13:10">13:10</span> Then Amnon said to Tamar, Take the food
and come into my bedroom, so that I may take it from your hand. So Tamar
took the cakes she had made and went with them into her brother Amnon's
bedroom.

<span id="an_13:11">13:11</span> And when she took them to give them to
him, he put his arms round her and said, Come to bed, my sister.

<span id="an_13:12">13:12</span> And answering him, she said, O my
brother, do not put shame on me; it is not right for such a thing to be
done in Israel: do not this evil thing.

<span id="an_13:13">13:13</span> What will become of me in my shame? and
as for you, you will be looked down on with disgust by all Israel. Now
then, go and make your request to the king, for he will not keep me from
you.

<span id="an_13:14">13:14</span> But he would not give attention to what
she said: but being stronger than she, he took her by force, and had
connection with her.

<span id="an_13:15">13:15</span> Then Amnon was full of hate for her,
hating her with a hate greater than his earlier love for her. And he
said to her, Get up and be gone.

<span id="an_13:16">13:16</span> And she said to him, Not so, my
brother, for this great wrong in sending me away is worse than what you
did to me before. But he gave no attention to her.

<span id="an_13:17">13:17</span> Then he gave a cry to the servant who
was waiting on him and said, Put this woman out, and let the door be
locked after her.

<span id="an_13:18">13:18</span> Now she had on a long robe, such as in
past times the king's virgin daughters were dressed in. Then the servant
put her out, locking the door after her.

<span id="an_13:19">13:19</span> And Tamar, in her grief, put dust on
her head; and she put her hand on her head and went away crying loudly.

<span id="an_13:20">13:20</span> And her brother Absalom said to her,
Has your brother Amnon been with you? but now, let there be an end to
your crying, my sister: he is your brother, do not take this thing to
heart. So Tamar went on living uncomforted in her brother's house.

<span id="an_13:21">13:21</span> But when King David had news of all
these things he was very angry; but he did not make trouble for Amnon
his son, for he was dear to David, being his oldest son.

<span id="an_13:22">13:22</span> But Absalom said nothing to his brother
Amnon, good or bad: for he was full of hate for him, because he had
taken his sister Tamar by force.

<span id="an_13:23">13:23</span> Now after two full years, Absalom had
men cutting the wool of his sheep in Baal-hazor, which is near Ephraim:
and he sent for all the king's sons to come to his feast.

<span id="an_13:24">13:24</span> And Absalom came to the king and said,
See now, your servant is cutting the wool of his sheep; will the king
and his servants be pleased to come?

<span id="an_13:25">13:25</span> And the king said to Absalom, No, my
son, let us not all go, or the number will be over-great for you. And he
made his request again, but he would not go, but he gave him his
blessing.

<span id="an_13:26">13:26</span> Then Absalom said, If you will not go,
then let my brother Amnon go with us. And the king said to him, Is there
any reason for him to go with you?

<span id="an_13:27">13:27</span> But Absalom went on requesting him till
he let Amnon and all the king's sons go with him. And Absalom made a
great feast like a feast for a king.

<span id="an_13:28">13:28</span> Now Absalom had given orders to his
servants, saying, Now take note when Amnon's heart is glad with wine;
and when I say to you, Make an attack on Amnon, then put him to death
without fear: have I not given you orders? be strong and without fear.

<span id="an_13:29">13:29</span> So Absalom's servants did to Amnon as
Absalom had given them orders. Then all the king's sons got up, and
every man got on his beast and went in flight.

<span id="an_13:30">13:30</span> Now while they were on their way, news
was given to David that Absalom had put to death all the sons of the
king and that not one of them was still living.

<span id="an_13:31">13:31</span> Then the king got up in great grief,
stretching himself out on the earth: and all his servants were by his
side, with their clothing parted.

<span id="an_13:32">13:32</span> And Jonadab, the son of Shimeah,
David's brother, said, Let not my lord have the idea that all the sons
of the king have been put to death; for only Amnon is dead: this has
been purposed by Absalom from the day when he took his sister Tamar by
force.

<span id="an_13:33">13:33</span> So now, let not my lord the king take
this thing to heart, with the idea that all the king's sons are dead:
for only Amnon is dead.

<span id="an_13:34">13:34</span> But Absalom went in flight. And the
young man who kept the watch, lifting up his eyes, saw that a great band
of people was coming down the slope by the way of the Horons; and the
watchman came and gave word to the king, saying, I saw men coming down
by the way of the Horons, from the hillside.

<span id="an_13:35">13:35</span> And Jonadab said to the king, See, the
king's sons are coming; as your servant said, so it is.

<span id="an_13:36">13:36</span> And while he was talking, the king's
sons came, with weeping and loud cries: and the king and all his
servants were weeping bitterly.

<span id="an_13:37">13:37</span> So Absalom went in flight and came to
Talmai, the son of Ammihud, the king of Geshur, where he was for three
years.

<span id="an_13:38">13:38</span> And the king was sorrowing for his son
all the time.

<span id="an_13:39">13:39</span> And the heart of David was wasted with
desire for Absalom: for he was comforted for the death of Amnon.

<span id="an_14:1">14:1</span> Now it was clear to Joab, the son of
Zeruiah, that the king's heart was turning to Absalom.

<span id="an_14:2">14:2</span> And Joab sent to Tekoa and got from there
a wise woman, and said to her, Now make yourself seem like one given up
to grief, and put on the clothing of sorrow, not using any sweet oil for
your body, but looking like one who for a long time has been weeping for
the dead:

<span id="an_14:3">14:3</span> And come to the king and say these words
to him. So Joab gave her words to say.

<span id="an_14:4">14:4</span> And the woman of Tekoa came to the king,
and falling on her face, gave him honour and said, Give me help, O king.

<span id="an_14:5">14:5</span> And the king said to her, What is your
trouble? And her answer was, Truly I am a widow, and my husband is dead.

<span id="an_14:6">14:6</span> And I had two sons, and the two of them
had a fight in the field, and there was no one to come between them, and
one with a blow put the other to death.

<span id="an_14:7">14:7</span> And now all the family is turned against
me, your servant, saying, Give up him who was the cause of his brother's
death, so that we may put him to death in payment for the life of his
brother, whose life he took; and we will put an end to the one who will
get the heritage: so they will put out my last burning coal, and my
husband will have no name or offspring on the face of the earth.

<span id="an_14:8">14:8</span> And the king said to the woman, Go to
your house and I will give orders about this.

<span id="an_14:9">14:9</span> And the woman of Tekoa said to the king,
My lord, O king, may the sin be on me and on my family, and may the king
and the seat of his kingdom be clear of sin!

<span id="an_14:10">14:10</span> And the king said, If anyone says
anything to you, make him come to me, and he will do you no more damage.

<span id="an_14:11">14:11</span> Then she said, Let the king keep in
mind the Lord your God, so that he who gives punishment for blood may be
kept back from further destruction and that no one may send death on my
son. And he said, By the living Lord, not a hair of your son's head will
come to the earth.

<span id="an_14:12">14:12</span> Then the woman said, Will the king let
his servant say one word more? And he said, Say on.

<span id="an_14:13">14:13</span> And the woman said, Why have you had
such a thought about the people of God? (for in saying these very words
the king has put himself in the wrong because he has not taken back the
one whom he sent far away.)

<span id="an_14:14">14:14</span> For death comes to us all, and we are
like water drained out on the earth, which it is not possible to take up
again; and God will not take away the life of the man whose purpose is
that he who has been sent away may not be completely cut off from him.

<span id="an_14:15">14:15</span> And now it is my fear of the people
which has made me come to say these words to my lord the king: and your
servant said, I will put my cause before the king, and it may be that he
will give effect to my request.

<span id="an_14:16">14:16</span> For the king will give ear, and take
his servant out of the power of the man whose purpose is the destruction
of me and my son together from the heritage of God.

<span id="an_14:17">14:17</span> Then your servant said, May the word of
my lord the king give me peace! for my lord the king is as the angel of
God in his hearing of good and bad: and may the Lord your God be with
you!

<span id="an_14:18">14:18</span> Then the king said to the woman, Now
give me an answer to the question I am going to put to you; keep nothing
back. And the woman said, Let my lord the king say on.

<span id="an_14:19">14:19</span> And the king said, Is not the hand of
Joab with you in all this? And the woman in answer said, By the life of
your soul, my lord the king, it is not possible for anyone to go to the
right hand or to the left from anything said by the king: your servant
Joab gave me orders, and put all these words in my mouth:

<span id="an_14:20">14:20</span> This he did, hoping that the face of
this business might be changed: and my lord is wise, with the wisdom of
the angel of God, having knowledge of everything on earth.

<span id="an_14:21">14:21</span> And the king said to Joab, See now, I
will do this thing: go then and Come back with the young man Absalom.

<span id="an_14:22">14:22</span> Then Joab, falling down on his face on
the earth, gave the king honour and blessing; and Joab said, Today it is
clear to your servant that I have grace in your eyes, my lord king,
because the king has given effect to the request of his servant.

<span id="an_14:23">14:23</span> So Joab got up and went to Geshur and
came back again to Jerusalem with Absalom.

<span id="an_14:24">14:24</span> And the king said, Let him go to his
house, but let him not see my face. So Absalom went back to his house
and did not see the face of the king.

<span id="an_14:25">14:25</span> Now in all Israel there was no one so
greatly to be praised for his beautiful form as Absalom: from his feet
to the crown of his head he was completely beautiful.

<span id="an_14:26">14:26</span> And when he had his hair cut, (which he
did at the end of every year, because of the weight of his hair;) the
weight of the hair was two hundred shekels by the king's weight.

<span id="an_14:27">14:27</span> And Absalom was the father of three
sons and of one daughter named Tamar, who was very beautiful.

<span id="an_14:28">14:28</span> For two full years Absalom was living
in Jerusalem without ever seeing the face of the king.

<span id="an_14:29">14:29</span> Then Absalom sent for Joab to send him
to the king, but he would not come to him: and he sent again a second
time, but he would not come.

<span id="an_14:30">14:30</span> So he said to his servants, See, Joab's
field is near mine, and he has barley in it; go and put it on fire. And
Absalom's servants put the field on fire.

<span id="an_14:31">14:31</span> Then Joab came to Absalom in his house
and said to him, Why have your servants put my field on fire?

<span id="an_14:32">14:32</span> And Absalom's answer was, See, I sent
to you saying, Come here, so that I may send you to the king to say, Why
have I come back from Geshur? it would be better for me to be there
still: let me now see the king's face, and if there is any sin in me,
let him put me to death.

<span id="an_14:33">14:33</span> So Joab went to the king and said these
words to him: and when the king had sent for him, Absalom came, and went
down on his face on the earth before the king: and the king gave him a
kiss.

<span id="an_15:1">15:1</span> Now after this, Absalom got for himself a
carriage and horses, and fifty runners to go before him.

<span id="an_15:2">15:2</span> And Absalom got up early, morning after
morning, and took his place at the side of the public meeting-place: and
when any man had a cause which had to come to the king to be judged,
then Absalom, crying out to him, said, What is your town? and he would
say, Your servant is of one of the tribes of Israel.

<span id="an_15:3">15:3</span> And Absalom would say to him, See, your
cause is true and right; but no man has been named by the king to give
you a hearing.

<span id="an_15:4">15:4</span> And more than this, Absalom said, If only
I was made judge in the land, so that every man who has any cause or
question might come to me, and I would give a right decision for him!

<span id="an_15:5">15:5</span> And if any man came near to give him
honour, he took him by the hand and gave him a kiss.

<span id="an_15:6">15:6</span> And this Absalom did to everyone in
Israel who came to the king to have his cause judged: so Absalom, like a
thief, took away the hearts of the men of Israel.

<span id="an_15:7">15:7</span> Now at the end of four years, Absalom
said to the king, Let me go to Hebron and give effect to the oath which
I made to the Lord:

<span id="an_15:8">15:8</span> For while I was living in Geshur in Aram,
your servant made an oath, saying, If ever the Lord lets me come back to
Jerusalem, I will give him worship in Hebron.

<span id="an_15:9">15:9</span> And the king said to him, Go in peace. So
he got up and went to Hebron.

<span id="an_15:10">15:10</span> But Absalom at the same time sent
watchers through all the tribes of Israel to say, At the sound of the
horn you are to say, Absalom is king in Hebron.

<span id="an_15:11">15:11</span> And with Absalom, at his request, went
two hundred men from Jerusalem, who were completely unconscious of his
designs.

<span id="an_15:12">15:12</span> And Absalom sent for Ahithophel the
Gilonite, one of David's helpers, from Giloh his town, while he was
making the offerings. And the design against David became strong, for
more and more people were joined to Absalom.

<span id="an_15:13">15:13</span> And one came to David and said, The
hearts of the men of Israel have gone after Absalom.

<span id="an_15:14">15:14</span> And David said to all his servants who
were with him at Jerusalem, Come, let us go in flight, or not one of us
will be safe from Absalom: let us go without loss of time, or he will
overtake us quickly and send evil on us, and put the town to the sword.

<span id="an_15:15">15:15</span> And the king's servants said to the
king, See, your servants are ready to do whatever the king says is to be
done.

<span id="an_15:16">15:16</span> So the king went out, taking with him
all the people of his house, but for ten of his women, who were to take
care of the house.

<span id="an_15:17">15:17</span> And the king went out, and all his
servants went after him, and made a stop at the Far House.

<span id="an_15:18">15:18</span> And all the people went on by his side;
and all the Cherethites and all the Pelethites and all the men of Ittai
of Gath, six hundred men who came after him from Gath, went on before
the king.

<span id="an_15:19">15:19</span> Then the king said to Ittai the
Gittite, Why are you coming with us? go back and keep with the king: for
you are a man of another country, you are far from the land of your
birth.

<span id="an_15:20">15:20</span> It was only yesterday you came to us;
why then am I to make you go up and down with us? for I have to go where
I may; go back then, and take your countrymen with you, and may the
Lord's mercy and good faith be with you.

<span id="an_15:21">15:21</span> And Ittai the Gittite in answer said,
By the living Lord, and by the life of my lord the king, in whatever
place my lord the king may be, for life or death, there will your
servant be.

<span id="an_15:22">15:22</span> And David said to Ittai, Go forward,
then. And Ittai the Gittite went on, with all his men and all the little
ones he had with him.

<span id="an_15:23">15:23</span> And there was great weeping in all the
country when all the people went through; and the king himself was
waiting in the Kidron valley and all the people went by him in the
direction of the olive-tree on the edge of the waste land.

<span id="an_15:24">15:24</span> Then Zadok came, and Abiathar, and with
them the ark of God's agreement: and they put down the ark of God, till
all the people from the town had gone by.

<span id="an_15:25">15:25</span> And the king said to Zadok, Take the
ark of God back into the town: if I have grace in the eyes of the Lord,
he will let me come back and see it and his House again:

<span id="an_15:26">15:26</span> But if he says, I have no delight in
you: then, here I am; let him do to me what seems good to him.

<span id="an_15:27">15:27</span> The king said further to Zadok the
priest, See, you and Abiathar are to go back to the town in peace, with
your two sons, Ahimaaz, your son, and Jonathan, the son of Abiathar.

<span id="an_15:28">15:28</span> See, I will be waiting at the way
across the river, in the waste land, till I get news from you.

<span id="an_15:29">15:29</span> So Zadok and Abiathar took the ark of
God back to Jerusalem, and did not go away from there.

<span id="an_15:30">15:30</span> And David went up the slopes of the
Mount of Olives weeping all the way, with his head covered and no shoes
on his feet: and all the people who were with him, covering their heads,
went up weeping.

<span id="an_15:31">15:31</span> And word came to David, saying,
Ahithophel is among those who are joined to Absalom. And David said, O
Lord, let the wisdom of Ahithophel be made foolish.

<span id="an_15:32">15:32</span> Now when David had come to the top of
the slope, where they gave worship to God, Hushai the Archite came to
him in great grief with dust on his head:

<span id="an_15:33">15:33</span> David said to him, If you go on with
me, you will be a trouble to me:

<span id="an_15:34">15:34</span> But if you go back to the town and say
to Absalom, I will be your servant, O king; as in the past I have been
your father's servant, so now I will be yours: then you will be able to
keep Ahithophel's designs against me from being put into effect.

<span id="an_15:35">15:35</span> And have you not there Zadok and
Abiathar the priests? so whatever comes to your ears from the king's
house, give word of it to Zadok and Abiathar the priests.

<span id="an_15:36">15:36</span> See, they have with them their two
sons, Ahimaaz, Zadok's son, and Jonathan, the son of Abiathar; by them
you may send word to me of everything which comes to your ears.

<span id="an_15:37">15:37</span> So Hushai, David's friend, went into
the town, and Absalom came to Jerusalem.

<span id="an_16:1">16:1</span> And when David had gone a little way past
the top of the slope, Ziba, the servant of Mephibosheth, came to him,
with two asses on which were two hundred cakes of bread and a hundred
stems of dry grapes and a hundred summer fruits and a skin of wine.

<span id="an_16:2">16:2</span> And David said to Ziba, What is your
reason for this? And Ziba said, The asses are for the use of the king's
people, and the bread and the fruit are food for the young men; and the
wine is for drink for those who are overcome by weariness in the waste
land.

<span id="an_16:3">16:3</span> And the king said, And where is your
master's son? And Ziba said, He is still at Jerusalem: for he said,
Today Israel will give back to me the kingdom of my father.

<span id="an_16:4">16:4</span> Then the king said to Ziba, Truly
everything which was Mephibosheth's is yours. And Ziba said, I give
honour to my lord, may I have grace in your eyes, my lord, O king!

<span id="an_16:5">16:5</span> And when King David came to Bahurim, a
man of Saul's family named Shimei, the son of Gera, came out from there,
calling curses after him.

<span id="an_16:6">16:6</span> And he sent stones at David and at all
the king's servants and at all the people and at all the men of war by
his side, on the right hand and on the left.

<span id="an_16:7">16:7</span> And Shimei said, with curses, Be gone, be
gone, you man of blood, you good-for-nothing:

<span id="an_16:8">16:8</span> The Lord has sent punishment on you for
all the blood of the family of Saul, whose kingdom you have taken; and
the Lord has given the kingdom to Absalom, your son: now you yourself
are taken in your evil, because you are a man of blood.

<span id="an_16:9">16:9</span> Then Abishai, the son of Zeruiah, said to
the king, Is this dead dog to go on cursing my lord the king? let me go
over and take off his head.

<span id="an_16:10">16:10</span> And the king said, What have I to do
with you, you sons of Zeruiah? Let him go on cursing, for the Lord has
said, Put a curse on David, and who then may say, Why have you done so?

<span id="an_16:11">16:11</span> And David said to Abishai and to all
his servants, You see how my son, the offspring of my body, has made
designs against my life: how much more then may this Benjamite do so?
Let him be, and let him go on cursing; for the Lord has given him
orders.

<span id="an_16:12">16:12</span> It may be that the Lord will take note
of my wrongs, and give me back good in answer to his cursing of me
today.

<span id="an_16:13">16:13</span> So David and his men went on their way:
and Shimei went by the hillside parallel with them, cursing and sending
stones and dust at him.

<span id="an_16:14">16:14</span> And the king and his people came tired
to Jordan, and took their rest there.

<span id="an_16:15">16:15</span> And Absalom and the men of Israel came
to Jerusalem, and Ahithophel was with him.

<span id="an_16:16">16:16</span> Then Hushai the Archite, David's
friend, came to Absalom and said, Long life to the king, long life to
the king!

<span id="an_16:17">16:17</span> And Absalom said, Is this your love for
your friend? why did you not go with your friend?

<span id="an_16:18">16:18</span> And Hushai said to Absalom, Not so; I
am for that man whom the Lord and this people and all the men of Israel
have taken as king, and I will take my place with him.

<span id="an_16:19">16:19</span> And more than this! where is my place
as a servant? is it not before his son? as I have been your father's
servant, so will I be yours.

<span id="an_16:20">16:20</span> Then Absalom said to Ahithophel, Give
your opinion now, what are we to do?

<span id="an_16:21">16:21</span> And Ahithophel said to Absalom, Go in
to your father's women who are here looking after his house; then all
Israel will have the news that you are hated by your father, and the
hands of your supporters will be strong.

<span id="an_16:22">16:22</span> So they put up the tent for Absalom on
the top of the house, and Absalom went in to his father's women before
the eyes of all Israel.

<span id="an_16:23">16:23</span> In those days the opinions of
Ahithophel were valued as highly as if through him a man might get
direction from God; so were they valued by David as much as by Absalom.

<span id="an_17:1">17:1</span> Then Ahithophel said to Absalom, Let me
take out twelve thousand men and this very night I will go after David:

<span id="an_17:2">17:2</span> And I will come up with him when he is
tired and feeble, and make him full of fear: and all the people with him
will go in flight; and I will make an attack on the king only:

<span id="an_17:3">17:3</span> And I will make all the people come back
to you as a bride comes back to her husband: it is the life of only one
man you are going after; so all the people will be at peace.

<span id="an_17:4">17:4</span> And the saying was pleasing to Absalom
and to the responsible men of Israel.

<span id="an_17:5">17:5</span> Then Absalom said, Now send for Hushai
the Archite, and let us give ear to what he has to say.

<span id="an_17:6">17:6</span> And when Hushai came, Absalom said to
him, This is what Ahithophel has said: are we to do as he says? if not,
what is your suggestion?

<span id="an_17:7">17:7</span> And Hushai said to Absalom, Ahithophel's
idea is not a good one at this time.

<span id="an_17:8">17:8</span> Hushai said further, You have knowledge
of your father and his men, that they are men of war, and that their
feelings are bitter, like those of a bear in the field whose young ones
have been taken from her: and your father is a man of war, and will not
take his night's rest with the people;

<span id="an_17:9">17:9</span> But he will certainly have taken cover
now in some hole or secret place; and if some of our people, at the
first attack, are overcome, then any hearing of it will say, There is
destruction among the people who are on Absalom's side.

<span id="an_17:10">17:10</span> Then even the strongest, whose heart is
like the heart of a lion, will become like water; for all Israel is
conscious that your father is a man of war, and those who are with him
are strong and without fear.

<span id="an_17:11">17:11</span> But my suggestion is that all Israel,
from Dan as far as Beer-sheba, comes together to you, a great army like
the sands of the sea in number; and that you yourself go out among them.

<span id="an_17:12">17:12</span> Then we will come on him in some place,
wherever he may be, falling on him as the dew comes on the earth: and of
him and all the men who are with him not one will get away with his
life.

<span id="an_17:13">17:13</span> And if he has gone into some town, then
let all Israel take strong cords to that town, and we will have it
pulled into the valley, till not one small stone is to be seen there.

<span id="an_17:14">17:14</span> Then Absalom and all the men of Israel
said, Hushai's suggestion is better than that of Ahithophel. For it was
the purpose of the Lord to make the wise designs of Ahithophel without
effect, so that the Lord might send evil on Absalom.

<span id="an_17:15">17:15</span> Then Hushai said to Zadok and Abiathar,
the priests, This is the suggestion made by Ahithophel to Absalom and
the responsible men of Israel, and this is what I said to them.

<span id="an_17:16">17:16</span> So now send the news quickly to David,
and say, Do not take your night's rest by the way across the river to
the waste land, but be certain to go over; or the king and all the
people with him will come to destruction.

<span id="an_17:17">17:17</span> Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz were waiting
by En-rogel; and a servant-girl went from time to time and gave them
news and they went with the news to King David, for it was not wise for
them to let themselves be seen coming into the town.

<span id="an_17:18">17:18</span> But a boy saw them, and gave word of it
to Absalom: so the two of them went away quickly, and came to the house
of a man in Bahurim who had a water-hole in his garden, and they went
down into it.

<span id="an_17:19">17:19</span> And a woman put a cover over the hole,
and put crushed grain on top of it, and no one had any knowledge of it.

<span id="an_17:20">17:20</span> And Absalom's servants came to the
woman at the house and said, Where are Ahimaaz and Jonathan? And the
woman said to them, They have gone from here to the stream. And after
searching for them, and seeing nothing of them, they went back to
Jerusalem.

<span id="an_17:21">17:21</span> Then after the servants had gone away,
they came up out of the water-hole and went to give King David the news;
and they said, Get up and go quickly over the water, for such and such
are Ahithophel's designs against you.

<span id="an_17:22">17:22</span> So David and all the people who were
with him went up over Jordan: when dawn came, every one of them had gone
over Jordan.

<span id="an_17:23">17:23</span> Now when Ahithophel saw that his
suggestion was not acted on, he got his ass ready, and went back to his
house, to the town where he came from, and having put his house in
order, he put himself to death by hanging; so he came to his end and was
put in the resting-place of his father.

<span id="an_17:24">17:24</span> And David came to Mahanaim. And
Absalom, with all the men of Israel, went over Jordan.

<span id="an_17:25">17:25</span> And Absalom put Amasa at the head of
the army in place of Joab. Now Amasa was the son of a man named Ithra
the Ishmaelite, who had been the lover of Abigail, the daughter of
Jesse, sister of Zeruiah, Joab's mother.

<span id="an_17:26">17:26</span> And Israel and Absalom put up their
tents in the land of Gilead.

<span id="an_17:27">17:27</span> Now when David had come to Mahanaim,
Shobi, the son of Nahash of Rabbah, the Ammonite, and Machir, the son of
Ammiel of Lo-debar, and Barzillai the Gileadite of Rogelim,

<span id="an_17:28">17:28</span> Came with beds and basins and pots, and
grain and meal, and all sorts of dry foods,

<span id="an_17:29">17:29</span> And honey and butter and sheep and
milk-cheeses, for David and his people: for they said, This people is in
the waste land, needing food and drink and rest.

<span id="an_18:1">18:1</span> And David had the people who were with
him numbered, and he put over them captains of thousands and captains of
hundreds.

<span id="an_18:2">18:2</span> And David sent the people out, a third of
them under the orders of Joab, and a third under the orders of Abishai,
son of Zeruiah, Joab's brother, and a third under Ittai the Gittite. And
the king said to the people, And I myself will certainly go out with
you.

<span id="an_18:3">18:3</span> But the people said, It is better for you
not to go out: for if we are put to flight, they will not give a thought
to us, and if death overtakes half of us, it will be nothing to them:
but you are of more value than ten thousand of us: so it is better for
you to be ready to come to our help from this town.

<span id="an_18:4">18:4</span> And the king said to them, I will do
whatever seems best to you. So the king took his place by the door of
the town, and all the people went out by hundreds and by thousands.

<span id="an_18:5">18:5</span> And the king gave orders to Joab and
Abishai and Ittai, saying, Because of me, be gentle to the young man
Absalom. And this order about Absalom was given in the hearing of all
the people.

<span id="an_18:6">18:6</span> So the people went out into the field
against Israel, and the fight took place in the woods of Ephraim.

<span id="an_18:7">18:7</span> And the people of Israel were overcome
there by the servants of David, and there was a great destruction that
day, and twenty thousand men were put to the sword.

<span id="an_18:8">18:8</span> And the fighting went on over all the
face of the country: and the woods were responsible for more deaths than
the sword.

<span id="an_18:9">18:9</span> And Absalom came across some of David's
men. And Absalom was seated on his mule, and the mule went under the
thick branches of a great tree, and his head became fixed in the tree
and he was lifted up between earth and heaven, and the beast under him
went on.

<span id="an_18:10">18:10</span> And a certain man saw it and said to
Joab, I saw Absalom hanging in a tree.

<span id="an_18:11">18:11</span> And Joab said to the man who had given
him the news, If you saw this, why did you not put your sword through
him, and I would have given you ten bits of silver and a band for your
robe?

<span id="an_18:12">18:12</span> And the man said to Joab, Even if you
gave me a thousand bits of silver, I would not put out my hand against
the king's son: for in our hearing the king gave orders to you and
Abishai and Ittai, saying, Take care that the young man Absalom is not
touched.

<span id="an_18:13">18:13</span> And if I had falsely put him to death
(and nothing may be kept secret from the king), you would have had
nothing to do with me.

<span id="an_18:14">18:14</span> Then Joab said, I would have made it
safe for you. And he took three spears in his hand, and put them through
Absalom's heart, while he was still living, in the branches of the tree.

<span id="an_18:15">18:15</span> And ten young men, servants of Joab,
came round Absalom and put an end to him.

<span id="an_18:16">18:16</span> And Joab had the horn sounded, and the
people came back from going after Israel, for Joab kept them back.

<span id="an_18:17">18:17</span> And they took Absalom's body and put it
into a great hole in the wood, and put a great mass of stones over it:
and every man of Israel went in flight to his tent.

<span id="an_18:18">18:18</span> Now Absalom, before his death, had put
up for himself a pillar in the king's valley, naming it after himself;
for he said, I have no son to keep my name in memory: and to this day it
is named Absalom's pillar.

<span id="an_18:19">18:19</span> Then Ahimaaz, the son of Zadok, said,
Let me go and give the king news of how the Lord has done right in his
cause against those who took up arms against him.

<span id="an_18:20">18:20</span> And Joab said, You will take no news
today; another day you may give him the news, but you will take no news
today, because the king's son is dead.

<span id="an_18:21">18:21</span> Then Joab said to the Cushite, Go and
give the king word of what you have seen. And the Cushite, making a sign
of respect to Joab, went off running.

<span id="an_18:22">18:22</span> Then Ahimaaz, the son of Zadok, said to
Joab again, Whatever may come of it, let me go after the Cushite. And
Joab said, Why have you a desire to go, my son, seeing that you will get
no reward for your news?

<span id="an_18:23">18:23</span> Whatever may come of it, he said, I
will go. Then he said to him, Go. So Ahimaaz went running by the lowland
road and overtook the Cushite.

<span id="an_18:24">18:24</span> Now David was seated between the two
town doors; and the watchman went up to the roof of the doorways, on the
wall, and, lifting up his eyes, saw a man running by himself.

<span id="an_18:25">18:25</span> And the watchman gave news of it to the
king. And the king said, If he is coming by himself, then he has news.
And the man was travelling quickly, and came near.

<span id="an_18:26">18:26</span> Then the watchman saw another man
running: and crying out in the direction of the door he said, Here is
another man running by himself. And the king said, He, like the other,
comes with news.

<span id="an_18:27">18:27</span> And the watchman said, It seems to me
that the running of the first is like the running of Ahimaaz, the son of
Zadok. And the king said, He is a good man, and his news will be good.

<span id="an_18:28">18:28</span> And Ahimaaz, crying out to the king,
said, It is well. And falling down before the king, with his face to the
earth, he said, May the Lord your God be praised, who has given up the
men who took up arms against my lord the king!

<span id="an_18:29">18:29</span> And the king said, Is it well with the
young man Absalom? And Ahimaaz said in answer, When Joab sent me, your
servant, I saw a great outcry going on, but I had no knowledge of what
it was.

<span id="an_18:30">18:30</span> And the king said, Get back and take
your place here. So turning to one side, he took his place there.

<span id="an_18:31">18:31</span> And then the Cushite came and said, I
have news for my lord the king: today the Lord has done right in your
cause against all those who took up arms against you.

<span id="an_18:32">18:32</span> And the king said to the Cushite, Is
the young man Absalom safe? And the Cushite said in answer, May all the
king's haters and those who do evil against the king, be as that young
man is!

<span id="an_18:33">18:33</span> Then the king was much moved, and went
up into the room over the door, weeping, and saying, O my son Absalom,
my son, my son Absalom! if only my life might have been given for yours,
O Absalom, my son, my son!

<span id="an_19:1">19:1</span> And word was given to Joab that the king
was weeping and sorrowing for Absalom.

<span id="an_19:2">19:2</span> And the salvation of that day was changed
to sorrow for all the people: for it was said to the people, The king is
in bitter grief for his son.

<span id="an_19:3">19:3</span> And the people made their way back to the
town quietly and secretly, as those who are shamed go secretly when they
go in flight from the war.

<span id="an_19:4">19:4</span> But the king, covering his face, gave a
great cry, O my son Absalom, O Absalom, my son, my son!

<span id="an_19:5">19:5</span> And Joab came into the house to the king
and said, Today you have put to shame the faces of all your servants who
even now have kept you and your sons and your daughters and your wives
and all your women safe from death;

<span id="an_19:6">19:6</span> For your haters, it seems, are dear to
you, and your friends are hated. For you have made it clear that
captains and servants are nothing to you: and now I see that if Absalom
was living and we had all been dead today, it would have been right in
your eyes.

<span id="an_19:7">19:7</span> So get up now, and go out and say some
kind words to your servants; for, by the Lord, I give you my oath, that
if you do not go out, not one of them will keep with you tonight; and
that will be worse for you than all the evil which has overtaken you
from your earliest years.

<span id="an_19:8">19:8</span> Then the king got up and took his seat
near the town-door. And word was given to all the people that the king
was in the public place: and all the people came before the king. Now
all the men of Israel had gone back in flight to their tents.

<span id="an_19:9">19:9</span> And through all the tribes of Israel the
people were having arguments, saying, The king made us safe from the
hands of those who were against us and made us free from the hands of
the Philistines; and now he has gone in flight from the land, because of
Absalom.

<span id="an_19:10">19:10</span> And Absalom, whom we made a ruler over
us, is dead in the fight. So now why do you say nothing about getting
the king back? And word of what all Israel was saying came to the king.

<span id="an_19:11">19:11</span> And King David sent word to Zadok and
Abiathar, the priests, Say to the responsible men of Judah, Why are you
the last to take steps to get the king back to his house?

<span id="an_19:12">19:12</span> You are my brothers, my bone and my
flesh; why are you the last to get the king back again?

<span id="an_19:13">19:13</span> And say to Amasa, Are you not my bone
and my flesh? May God's punishment be on me, if I do not make you chief
of the army before me at all times in place of Joab!

<span id="an_19:14">19:14</span> And the hearts of the men of Judah were
moved like one man; so that they sent to the king, saying, Come back,
with all your servants.

<span id="an_19:15">19:15</span> So the king came back, and came as far
as Jordan. And Judah came to Gilgal, meeting the king there, to take him
back with them over Jordan.

<span id="an_19:16">19:16</span> And Shimei, the son of Gera, the
Benjamite from Bahurim, got up quickly and went down with the men of
Judah for the purpose of meeting King David;

<span id="an_19:17">19:17</span> And with him a thousand men of
Benjamin, and Ziba, the servant of Saul, with his fifteen sons and
twenty servants, came rushing to Jordan before the king,

<span id="an_19:18">19:18</span> And kept going across the river to take
the people of the king's house over, and to do whatever was desired by
the king. And Shimei, the son of Gera, went down on his face in the dust
before the king, when he was about to go over Jordan,

<span id="an_19:19">19:19</span> And said to him, Let me not be judged
as a sinner in your eyes, O my lord, and do not keep in mind the wrong I
did on the day when my lord the king went out of Jerusalem, or take it
to heart.

<span id="an_19:20">19:20</span> For your servant is conscious of his
sin: and so, as you see, I have come today, the first of all the sons of
Joseph, for the purpose of meeting my lord the king.

<span id="an_19:21">19:21</span> But Abishai, the son of Zeruiah, said,
Is not death the right fate for Shimei, because he has been cursing the
one marked by the holy oil?

<span id="an_19:22">19:22</span> And David said, What have I to do with
you, you sons of Zeruiah, that you put yourselves against me today? is
it right for any man in Israel to be put to death today? for I am
certain today that I am king in Israel.

<span id="an_19:23">19:23</span> So the king said to Shimei, You will
not be put to death. And the king gave him his oath.

<span id="an_19:24">19:24</span> And Mephibosheth, the son of Saul's
son, came down for the purpose of meeting the king; his feet had not
been cared for or his hair cut or his clothing washed from the day when
the king went away till the day when he came back in peace.

<span id="an_19:25">19:25</span> Now when he had come from Jerusalem to
see the king, the king said to him, Why did you not come with me,
Mephibosheth?

<span id="an_19:26">19:26</span> And he said in answer, Because of the
deceit of my servant, my lord king: for I, your servant, said to him,
You are to make ready an ass and on it I will go with the king, for your
servant has not the use of his feet.

<span id="an_19:27">19:27</span> He has given you a false account of me:
but my lord the king is like the angel of God: do then whatever seems
good to you.

<span id="an_19:28">19:28</span> For all my father's family were only
dead men before my lord the king: and still you put your servant among
those whose place is at the king's table. What right then have I to say
anything more to the king?

<span id="an_19:29">19:29</span> And the king said, Say nothing more
about these things. I say, Let there be a division of the land between
Ziba and you.

<span id="an_19:30">19:30</span> And Mephibosheth said, Let him take it
all, now that my lord the king has come back to his house in peace!

<span id="an_19:31">19:31</span> And Barzillai the Gileadite came down
from Rogelim; and he went on as far as Jordan with the king to take him
across Jordan.

<span id="an_19:32">19:32</span> Now Barzillai was a very old man, as
much as eighty years old: and he had given the king everything he had
need of, while he was at Mahanaim, for he was a very great man.

<span id="an_19:33">19:33</span> And the king said to Barzillai, Come
over with me, and I will take care of you in Jerusalem.

<span id="an_19:34">19:34</span> And Barzillai said to the king, How
much of my life is still before me, for me to go up to Jerusalem with
the king?

<span id="an_19:35">19:35</span> I am now eighty years old: good and bad
are the same to me; have meat and drink any taste for me now? am I able
to take pleasure in the voices of men or women in song? why then am I to
be a trouble to my lord the king?

<span id="an_19:36">19:36</span> Your servant's desire was only to take
the king over Jordan; why is the king to give me such a reward?

<span id="an_19:37">19:37</span> Let your servant now go back again, so
that when death comes to me, it may be in my town and by the
resting-place of my father and mother. But here is your servant Chimham:
let him go with my lord the king, and do for him what seems good to you.

<span id="an_19:38">19:38</span> And the king said in answer, Let
Chimham go over with me, and I will do for him whatever seems good to
you: and whatever your desire is, I will do it for you.

<span id="an_19:39">19:39</span> Then all the people went over Jordan,
and the king went over: and the king gave Barzillai a kiss, with his
blessing; and he went back to his place.

<span id="an_19:40">19:40</span> So the king went over to Gilgal, and
Chimham went with him: and all the people of Judah, as well as half the
people of Israel, took the king on his way.

<span id="an_19:41">19:41</span> Then the men of Israel came to the king
and said, Why have our countrymen of Judah taken you away in secret and
come over Jordan with the king and all his family, because all his
people are David's men?

<span id="an_19:42">19:42</span> And all the men of Judah gave this
answer to the men of Israel, Because the king is our near relation: why
then are you angry about this? have we taken any of the king's food, or
has he given us any offering?

<span id="an_19:43">19:43</span> And in answer to the men of Judah, the
men of Israel said, We have ten parts in the king, and we are the first
in order of birth: why did you make nothing of us? and were we not the
first to make suggestions for getting the king back? And the words of
the men of Judah were more violent than the words of the men of Israel.

<span id="an_20:1">20:1</span> Now by chance there was present a
good-for-nothing person named Sheba, the son of Bichri, a Benjamite: and
he, sounding the horn, said, We have no part in David, or any interest
in the son of Jesse: let every man go to his tent, O Israel.

<span id="an_20:2">20:2</span> So all the men of Israel, turning away
from David, went after Sheba, the son of Bichri: but the men of Judah
were true to their king, going with him from Jordan as far as Jerusalem.

<span id="an_20:3">20:3</span> And David came to his house at Jerusalem:
and the king took the ten women to whom he had given the care of the
house, and had them shut up, and gave them the necessaries of life, but
did not go near them. So they were shut up till the day of their death,
living as widows.

<span id="an_20:4">20:4</span> Then the king said to Amasa, Get all the
men of Judah together, and in three days be here yourself.

<span id="an_20:5">20:5</span> So Amasa went to get all the men of Judah
together, but he took longer than the time David had given him.

<span id="an_20:6">20:6</span> And David said to Abishai, Sheba, the son
of Bichri, will do us more damage than Absalom did; so take some of your
lord's servants and go after him, before he makes himself safe in the
walled towns, and gets away before our eyes.

<span id="an_20:7">20:7</span> So there went after Abishai, Joab and the
Cherethites and the Pelethites and all the fighting-men; they went out
of Jerusalem to overtake Sheba, the son of Bichri.

<span id="an_20:8">20:8</span> When they were at the great stone which
is in Gibeon, Amasa came face to face with them. Now Joab had on his
war-dress, and round him a band from which his sword was hanging in its
cover; and while he was walking, it came out, falling to the earth.

<span id="an_20:9">20:9</span> And Joab said to Amasa, Is it well, my
brother? And with his right hand he took him by the hair of his chin to
give him a kiss.

<span id="an_20:10">20:10</span> But Amasa did not see danger from the
sword which was now in Joab's left hand, and Joab put it through his
stomach so that his inside came out on to the earth, and he did not give
him another blow. So Joab and his brother Abishai went on after Sheba,
the son of Bichri.

<span id="an_20:11">20:11</span> And one of Joab's young men, taking his
place at Amasa's side, said, Whoever is for Joab and for David, let him
go after Joab!

<span id="an_20:12">20:12</span> And Amasa was stretched out in a pool
of blood in the middle of the highway. And when the man saw that all the
people were stopping, he took Amasa out of the highway and put him in a
field, with a cloth over him, when he saw that everyone who went by came
to a stop.

<span id="an_20:13">20:13</span> When he had been taken off the road,
all the people went on after Joab in search of Sheba, the son of Bichri.

<span id="an_20:14">20:14</span> And Sheba went through all the tribes
of Israel, to Abel of Beth-maacah; and all the Bichrites came together
and went in after him.

<span id="an_20:15">20:15</span> And Joab and his men got him shut up in
Abel of Beth-maacah, and put up an earthwork against the town: and all
Joab's men did their best to get the wall broken down.

<span id="an_20:16">20:16</span> Then a wise woman got up on the wall,
and crying out from the town, said, Give ear, give ear; say now to Joab,
Come near, so that I may have talk with you.

<span id="an_20:17">20:17</span> And he came near, and the woman said,
Are you Joab? And he said in answer, I am. Then she said, Give ear to
your servant's words. And he said, I am giving ear.

<span id="an_20:18">20:18</span> Then she said, In the old days, there
was a saying, Let them put the question in Abel and in Dan, saying, Has
what was ordered by men of good faith in Israel ever come to an end?

<span id="an_20:19">20:19</span> Your purpose is the destruction of a
mother-town in Israel: why would you put an end to the heritage of the
Lord?

<span id="an_20:20">20:20</span> And Joab, answering her, said, Far, far
be it from me to be a cause of death or destruction;

<span id="an_20:21">20:21</span> Not so: but a man of the hill-country
of Ephraim, Sheba, son of Bichri, by name, has taken up arms against the
king, against David: give up this man only, and I will go away from the
town. And the woman said to Joab, His head will be dropped over the wall
to you.

<span id="an_20:22">20:22</span> Then the woman in her wisdom had talk
with all the town. And they had Sheba's head cut off and sent out to
Joab. And he had the horn sounded, and sent them all away from the town,
every man to his tent. And Joab went back to Jerusalem to the king.

<span id="an_20:23">20:23</span> Now Joab was over all the army; and
Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, was at the head of the Cherethites and the
Pelethites;

<span id="an_20:24">20:24</span> And Adoram was overseer of the forced
work; and Jehoshaphat, the son of Ahilud, was the recorder;

<span id="an_20:25">20:25</span> And Sheva was the scribe, and Zadok and
Abiathar were priests;

<span id="an_20:26">20:26</span> And in addition, Ira the Jairite was a
priest to David.

<span id="an_21:1">21:1</span> In the days of David they were short of
food for three years, year after year; and David went before the Lord
for directions. And the Lord said, On Saul and on his family there is
blood, because he put the Gibeonites to death.

<span id="an_21:2">21:2</span> Then the king sent for the Gibeonites;
(now the Gibeonites were not of the children of Israel, but were the
last of the Amorites, to whom the children of Israel had given an oath;
but Saul, in his passion for the children of Israel and Judah, had made
an attempt on their lives:)

<span id="an_21:3">21:3</span> So David said to the Gibeonites, What may
I do for you? how am I to make up to you for your wrongs, so that you
may give a blessing to the heritage of the Lord?

<span id="an_21:4">21:4</span> And the Gibeonites said to him, It is not
a question of silver and gold between us and Saul or his family; and it
is not in our power to put to death any man in Israel. And he said, Say,
then, what am I to do for you?

<span id="an_21:5">21:5</span> And they said to the king, As for the man
by whom we were wasted, and who made designs against us to have us
completely cut off from the land of Israel,

<span id="an_21:6">21:6</span> Let seven men of his family be given up
to us and we will put an end to them by hanging them before the Lord in
Gibeon, on the hill of the Lord. And the king said, I will give them.

<span id="an_21:7">21:7</span> But the king did not give up
Mephibosheth, the son of Saul's son Jonathan, because of the Lord's oath
made between David and Jonathan, the son of Saul.

<span id="an_21:8">21:8</span> But the king took Armoni and
Mephibosheth, the two sons of Saul to whom Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah,
had given birth; and the five sons of Saul's daughter Merab, whose
father was Adriel, the son of Barzillai the Meholathite:

<span id="an_21:9">21:9</span> And he gave them up to the Gibeonites,
and they put them to death, hanging them on the mountain before the
Lord; all seven came to their end together in the first days of the
grain-cutting, at the start of the cutting of the barley.

<span id="an_21:10">21:10</span> And Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah, took
haircloth, placing it on the rock as a bed for herself, from the start
of the grain-cutting till rain came down on them from heaven; and she
did not let the birds of the air come near them by day, or the beasts of
the field by night.

<span id="an_21:11">21:11</span> And news was given to David of what
Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah, one of Saul's wives, had done.

<span id="an_21:12">21:12</span> And David went and took the bones of
Saul and his son Jonathan from the men of Jabesh-gilead, who had taken
them away secretly from the public place of Beth-shan, where the
Philistines had put them, hanging up the bodies there on the day when
they put Saul to death in Gilboa:

<span id="an_21:13">21:13</span> And he took the bones of Saul and his
son Jonathan from that place; and they got together the bones of those
who had been put to death by hanging.

<span id="an_21:14">21:14</span> And they put them with the bones of
Saul and his son Jonathan in the resting-place of Kish, his father, in
Zela in the country of Benjamin; they did all the king had given them
orders to do. And after that, God gave ear to their prayers for the
land.

<span id="an_21:15">21:15</span> And the Philistines went to war again
with Israel; and David went down with his people, and while they were at
Gob they had a fight with the Philistines:

<span id="an_21:16">21:16</span> And there came against David one of the
offspring of the Rephaim, whose spear was three hundred shekels of brass
in weight, and having a new sword, he made an attempt to put David to
death.

<span id="an_21:17">21:17</span> But Abishai, the son of Zeruiah, came
to his help, and, turning on the Philistine, gave him his death-blow.
Then David's men took an oath, and said, Never again are you to go out
with us to the fight, so that you may not put out the light of Israel.

<span id="an_21:18">21:18</span> Now after this there was war with the
Philistines again at Gob, and Sibbecai the Hushathite put to death Saph,
one of the offspring of the Rephaim.

<span id="an_21:19">21:19</span> And again there was war with the
Philistines at Gob, and Elhanan, the son of Jair the Beth-lehemite, put
to death Goliath the Gittite, the stem of whose spear was like a
cloth-worker's rod.

<span id="an_21:20">21:20</span> And again there was war at Gath, where
there was a very tall man, who had twenty-four fingers and toes, six
fingers on his hands and six toes on his feet; he was one of the
offspring of the Rephaim.

<span id="an_21:21">21:21</span> And when he was purposing to put shame
on Israel, Jonathan, the son of Shimei, David's brother, put him to
death.

<span id="an_21:22">21:22</span> These four were of the offspring of the
Rephaim in Gath; and they came to their end by the hands of David and
his servants.

<span id="an_22:1">22:1</span> And David made a song to the Lord in
these words, on the day when the Lord made him free from the hands of
all his haters, and from the hand of Saul:

<span id="an_22:2">22:2</span> And he said, The Lord is my Rock, my
walled town, and my saviour, even mine;

<span id="an_22:3">22:3</span> My God, my Rock, in him will I put my
faith; my breastplate, and the horn of my salvation, my high tower, and
my safe place; my saviour, who keeps me safe from the violent man.

<span id="an_22:4">22:4</span> I will send up my cry to the Lord, who is
to be praised; so will I be made safe from those who are against me.

<span id="an_22:5">22:5</span> For the waves of death came round me, and
the seas of evil put me in fear;

<span id="an_22:6">22:6</span> The cords of hell were round me: the nets
of death came on me.

<span id="an_22:7">22:7</span> In my trouble my voice went up to the
Lord, and my cry to my God: my voice came to his hearing in his holy
Temple, and my prayer came to his ears.

<span id="an_22:8">22:8</span> Then the earth was moved with a violent
shock; the bases of heaven were moved and shaking, because he was angry.

<span id="an_22:9">22:9</span> There went up a smoke from his nose, and
a fire of destruction from his mouth: coals were lighted by it.

<span id="an_22:10">22:10</span> The heavens were bent, so that he might
come down; and it was dark under his feet.

<span id="an_22:11">22:11</span> And he went through the air, seated on
a storm-cloud: going quickly on the wings of the wind.

<span id="an_22:12">22:12</span> And he made the dark his tent round
him, a mass of waters, thick clouds of the skies.

<span id="an_22:13">22:13</span> Before his shining light his dark
clouds went past, raining ice and coals of fire.

<span id="an_22:14">22:14</span> The Lord made thunder in the heavens,
and the voice of the Highest was sounding out.

<span id="an_22:15">22:15</span> And he sent out his arrows, driving
them in all directions; by his flames of fire they were troubled.

<span id="an_22:16">22:16</span> Then the deep beds of the sea were
seen, and the bases of the world were uncovered, because of the Lord's
wrath, because of the breath of his mouth.

<span id="an_22:17">22:17</span> He sent from on high, he took me,
pulling me out of great waters.

<span id="an_22:18">22:18</span> He made me free from my strong hater,
from those who were against me, because they were stronger than I.

<span id="an_22:19">22:19</span> They came on me in the day of my
trouble: but the Lord was my support.

<span id="an_22:20">22:20</span> He took me out into a wide place; he
was my saviour because he had delight in me.

<span id="an_22:21">22:21</span> The Lord gives me the reward of my
righteousness, because my hands are clean before him.

<span id="an_22:22">22:22</span> For I have kept the ways of the Lord; I
have not been turned away in sin from my God.

<span id="an_22:23">22:23</span> For all his decisions were before me,
and I did not put away his laws from me.

<span id="an_22:24">22:24</span> And I was upright before him, and I
kept myself from sin.

<span id="an_22:25">22:25</span> Because of this the Lord has given me
the reward of my righteousness, because my hands are clean in his eyes.

<span id="an_22:26">22:26</span> On him who has mercy you will have
mercy; to the upright you will be upright;

<span id="an_22:27">22:27</span> He who is holy will see that you are
holy; but to the man whose way is not straight you will be a hard judge.

<span id="an_22:28">22:28</span> For you are the saviour of those who
are in trouble; but your eyes are on men of pride, to make them low.

<span id="an_22:29">22:29</span> For you are my light, O Lord; and the
Lord will make the dark bright for me.

<span id="an_22:30">22:30</span> By your help I have made a way through
the wall which was shutting me in: by the help of my God I have gone
over a wall.

<span id="an_22:31">22:31</span> As for God, his way is all good: the
word of the Lord is tested; he is a safe cover for all those who put
their faith in him.

<span id="an_22:32">22:32</span> For who is God but the Lord? and who is
a Rock but our God?

<span id="an_22:33">22:33</span> God puts a strong band about me,
guiding me in a straight way.

<span id="an_22:34">22:34</span> He makes my feet like roes' feet, and
puts me on high places.

<span id="an_22:35">22:35</span> He makes my hands expert in war, so
that a bow of brass is bent by my arms.

<span id="an_22:36">22:36</span> You have given me the breastplate of
your salvation, and your mercy has made me great.

<span id="an_22:37">22:37</span> You have made my steps wide under me,
so that my feet make no slip.

<span id="an_22:38">22:38</span> I go after my haters and overtake them;
not turning back till they are all overcome.

<span id="an_22:39">22:39</span> I have sent destruction on them and
given them wounds, so that they are not able to get up: they are
stretched under my feet.

<span id="an_22:40">22:40</span> For I have been armed by you with
strength for the fight: you have made low under me those who came out
against me.

<span id="an_22:41">22:41</span> By you their backs are turned in
flight, so that my haters are cut off.

<span id="an_22:42">22:42</span> They were crying out, but there was no
one to come to their help: even to the Lord, but he gave them no answer.

<span id="an_22:43">22:43</span> Then they were crushed as small as the
dust of the earth, stamped down under my feet like the waste of the
streets.

<span id="an_22:44">22:44</span> You have made me free from the
fightings of my people; you have made me the head of the nations: a
people of whom I had no knowledge will be my servants.

<span id="an_22:45">22:45</span> Men of other countries will, with false
hearts, put themselves under my authority: from the time when my name
comes to their ears, they will be ruled by me.

<span id="an_22:46">22:46</span> They will be wasted away, they will
come out of their secret places shaking with fear.

<span id="an_22:47">22:47</span> The Lord is living; praise be to my
Rock, and let the God of my salvation be honoured:

<span id="an_22:48">22:48</span> It is God who sends punishment on my
haters, and puts peoples under my rule.

<span id="an_22:49">22:49</span> He makes me free from my haters: I am
lifted up over those who come up against me: you have made me free from
the violent man.

<span id="an_22:50">22:50</span> Because of this I will give you praise,
O Lord, among the nations, and will make a song of praise to your name.

<span id="an_22:51">22:51</span> Great salvation does he give to his
king; he has mercy on the king of his selection, David, and on his seed
for ever.

<span id="an_23:1">23:1</span> Now these are the last words of David.
David, the son of Jesse, says, the man who was lifted up on high, the
man on whom the God of Jacob put the holy oil, the loved one of Israel's
songs, says:

<span id="an_23:2">23:2</span> The spirit of the Lord had voice through
me, his word was on my tongue.

<span id="an_23:3">23:3</span> The God of Israel said, the word of the
Rock of Israel came to me: When an upright king is ruling over men, when
he is ruling in the fear of God,

<span id="an_23:4">23:4</span> It is as the light of the morning, when
the sun comes up, a morning without clouds; making young grass come to
life from the earth.

<span id="an_23:5">23:5</span> For is not my house so with God? For he
has made with me an eternal agreement, ordered in all things and
certain: as for all my salvation and all my desire, will he not give it
increase?

<span id="an_23:6">23:6</span> But the evil-doers, all of them, will be
like thorns to be pushed away, because they may not be gripped in the
hand:

<span id="an_23:7">23:7</span> But anyone touching them has to be armed
with iron and the rod of a spear; and they will be burned with fire,
every one of them.

<span id="an_23:8">23:8</span> These are the names of David's men of
war: Ishbaal the Hachmonite, chief of the three; his axe was lifted up
against eight hundred put to death at one time.

<span id="an_23:9">23:9</span> After him was Eleazar, the son of Dodai
the Ahohite, one of the three great fighters, who was with David in
Pas-dammim when the Philistines came together there for the fight; and
when the men of Israel had gone in flight,

<span id="an_23:10">23:10</span> He was with David and went on fighting
the Philistines till his hand became tired and stiff from gripping his
sword: and that day the Lord gave a great salvation, and the people came
back after him only to take the goods of the Philistines.

<span id="an_23:11">23:11</span> After him was Shammah, the son of Ela
the Hararite. And the Philistines came together in Lehi, where there was
a bit of land full of seed; and the people went in flight from the
Philistines.

<span id="an_23:12">23:12</span> But he kept his place in the middle of
the bit of land, and kept back their attack and overcame the
Philistines: and the Lord gave a great salvation.

<span id="an_23:13">23:13</span> And three of the thirty went down at
the start of the grain-cutting, and they came to David at the strong
place of Adullam; and the band of Philistines had taken up their
position in the valley of Rephaim.

<span id="an_23:14">23:14</span> And at that time David had taken cover
in the strong place, and an armed force of the Philistines was in
Beth-lehem.

<span id="an_23:15">23:15</span> And David, moved by a strong desire,
said, If only someone would give me a drink of water from the water-hole
of Beth-lehem, by the doorway into the town!

<span id="an_23:16">23:16</span> And the three men, forcing their way
through the Philistine army, got water from the water-hole of
Beth-lehem, by the doorway into the town, and took it back to David: but
he would not take it, but, draining it out, made an offering of it to
the Lord.

<span id="an_23:17">23:17</span> And he said, Far be it from me, O Lord,
to do this; how may I take as my drink the life-blood of men who have
put their lives in danger? So he would not take it. These things did the
three great men of war.

<span id="an_23:18">23:18</span> And Abishai, the brother of Joab, the
son of Zeruiah, was chief of the thirty. He put to death three hundred
with his spear, and he got for himself a name among the thirty.

<span id="an_23:19">23:19</span> Was he not the noblest of the thirty?
so he was made their captain: but he was not equal to the first three.

<span id="an_23:20">23:20</span> And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, a
fighting man of Kabzeel, had done great acts; he put to death the two
sons of Ariel of Moab: he went down into a hole and put a lion to death
in time of snow:

<span id="an_23:21">23:21</span> And he made an attack on an Egyptian, a
tall man: and the Egyptian had a spear in his hand; but he went down to
him with a stick, and pulling the spear out of the hands of the
Egyptian, put him to death with that same spear.

<span id="an_23:22">23:22</span> These were the acts of Benaiah, the son
of Jehoiada, who had a great name among the thirty men of war.

<span id="an_23:23">23:23</span> He was honoured over the rest of the
thirty, but he was not equal to the first three. And David put him over
the fighting men who kept him safe.

<span id="an_23:24">23:24</span> Asahel, the brother of Joab, was one of
the thirty; and Elhanan, the son of Dodai, of Beth-lehem,

<span id="an_23:25">23:25</span> Shammah the Harodite, Elika the
Harodite,

<span id="an_23:26">23:26</span> Helez the Paltite, Ira, the son of
Ikkesh the Tekoite,

<span id="an_23:27">23:27</span> Abiezer the Anathothite, Sibbecai the
Hushathite,

<span id="an_23:28">23:28</span> Zalmon the Ahohite, Maharai the
Netophathite,

<span id="an_23:29">23:29</span> Heldai, the son of Baanah the
Netophathite, Ittai, the son of Ribai of Gibeah of the children of
Benjamin,

<span id="an_23:30">23:30</span> Benaiah the Pirathonite, Hiddai of the
valleys of Gaash,

<span id="an_23:31">23:31</span> Abiel the Arbathite, Azmaveth of
Bahurim,

<span id="an_23:32">23:32</span> Eliahba the Shaalbonite, Jashen the
Gunite,

<span id="an_23:33">23:33</span> Jonathan, the son of Shammah the
Hararite, Ahiam, the son of Sharar the Hararite,

<span id="an_23:34">23:34</span> Eliphelet, the son of Ahasbai the
Maacathite, Eliam, the son of Ahithophel the Gilonite,

<span id="an_23:35">23:35</span> Hezrai the Carmelite, Paarai the
Archite,

<span id="an_23:36">23:36</span> Igal, the son of Nathan of Zobah, Bani
the Gadite,

<span id="an_23:37">23:37</span> Zelek the Ammonite, Naharai the
Beerothite, who had the care of the arms of Joab, son of Zeruiah,

<span id="an_23:38">23:38</span> Ira the Ithrite, Gareb the Ithrite,

<span id="an_23:39">23:39</span> Uriah the Hittite: thirty-seven in
number.

<span id="an_24:1">24:1</span> Again the wrath of the Lord was burning
against Israel, and moving David against them, he said, Go, take the
number of Israel and Judah.

<span id="an_24:2">24:2</span> And the king said to Joab and the
captains of the army, who were with him, Go now through all the tribes
of Israel, from Dan as far as Beer-sheba, and have all the people
numbered, so that I may be certain of the number of the people.

<span id="an_24:3">24:3</span> And Joab said to the king, Whatever the
number of the people, may the Lord make it a hundred times as much, and
may the eyes of my lord the king see it: but why does my lord the king
take pleasure in doing this thing?

<span id="an_24:4">24:4</span> But the king's order was stronger than
Joab and the captains of the army. And Joab and the captains of the army
went out from the king, to take the number of the children of Israel.

<span id="an_24:5">24:5</span> And they went over Jordan, and starting
from Aroer, from the town which is in the middle of the valley, they
went in the direction of the Gadites, and on to Jazer;

<span id="an_24:6">24:6</span> Then they came to Gilead, and to the land
of the Hittites under Hermon; and they came to Dan, and from Dan they
came round to Zidon,

<span id="an_24:7">24:7</span> And to the walled town of Tyre, and to
all the towns of the Hivites and the Canaanites: and they went out to
the South of Judah at Beer-sheba.

<span id="an_24:8">24:8</span> So after going through all the land in
every direction, they came to Jerusalem at the end of nine months and
twenty days.

<span id="an_24:9">24:9</span> And Joab gave the king the number of all
the people: there were in Israel eight hundred thousand fighting men
able to take up arms; and the men of Judah were five hundred thousand.

<span id="an_24:10">24:10</span> And after the people had been numbered,
David's heart was troubled. And David said to the Lord, Great has been
my sin in doing this; but now, O Lord, be pleased to take away the sin
of your servant, for I have done very foolishly

<span id="an_24:11">24:11</span> And David got up in the morning; now
the word of the Lord had come to the prophet Gad, David's seer, saying,

<span id="an_24:12">24:12</span> Go and say to David, The Lord says,
Three things are offered to you: say which of them you will have, and I
will do it to you.

<span id="an_24:13">24:13</span> So Gad came to David, and gave him word
of this and said to him, Are there to be three years when there is not
enough food in your land? or will you go in flight from your haters for
three months, while they go after you? or will you have three days of
violent disease in your land? take thought and say what answer I am to
give to him who sent me.

<span id="an_24:14">24:14</span> And David said to Gad, This is a hard
decision for me to make: let us come into the hands of the Lord, for
great are his mercies: let me not come into the hands of men.

<span id="an_24:15">24:15</span> So David made selection of the disease;
and the time was the days of the grain-cutting, when the disease came
among the people, causing the death of seventy thousand men from Dan as
far as Beer-sheba.

<span id="an_24:16">24:16</span> And when the hand of the angel was
stretched out in the direction of Jerusalem, for its destruction, the
Lord had regret for the evil, and said to the angel who was sending
destruction on the people, It is enough; do no more. And the angel of
the Lord was by the grain-floor of Araunah the Jebusite.

<span id="an_24:17">24:17</span> And when David saw the angel who was
causing the destruction of the people, he said to the Lord, Truly, the
sin is mine; I have done wrong: but these are only sheep; what have they
done? let your hand be against me and against my family.

<span id="an_24:18">24:18</span> And that day Gad came to David and said
to him, Go up, and put up an altar to the Lord on the grain-floor of
Araunah the Jebusite.

<span id="an_24:19">24:19</span> So David went up, as Gad had said and
as the Lord had given orders.

<span id="an_24:20">24:20</span> And Araunah, looking out, saw the king
and his servants coming to him: and Araunah went out, and went down on
his face to the earth before the king.

<span id="an_24:21">24:21</span> And Araunah said, Why has my lord the
king come to his servant? And David said, To give you a price for your
grain-floor, so that I may put up an altar to the Lord, and the disease
may be stopped among the people.

<span id="an_24:22">24:22</span> And Araunah said to David, Let my lord
the king take whatever seems right to him, and make an offering of it:
see, here are the oxen for the burned offering, and the grain-cleaning
instruments and the ox-yokes for wood:

<span id="an_24:23">24:23</span> All this does the servant of my lord
the king give to the king. And Araunah said, May the Lord your God be
pleased with your offering!

<span id="an_24:24">24:24</span> And the king said to Araunah, No, but I
will give you a price for it; I will not give to the Lord my God burned
offerings for which I have given nothing. So David got the grain-floor
and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver.

<span id="an_24:25">24:25</span> And there David put up an altar to the
Lord, making burned offerings and peace-offerings. So the Lord gave ear
to his prayer for the land, and the disease came to an end in Israel.
