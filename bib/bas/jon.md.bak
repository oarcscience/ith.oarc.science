### Basic English Bible: Jonah

<span id="an_1:1">1:1</span> And the word of the Lord came to Jonah, the
son of Amittai, saying,

<span id="an_1:2">1:2</span> Up! go to Nineveh, that great town, and let
your voice come to it; for their evil-doing has come up before me.

<span id="an_1:3">1:3</span> And Jonah got up to go in flight to
Tarshish, away from the Lord; and he went down to Joppa, and saw there a
ship going to Tarshish: so he gave them the price of the journey and
went down into it to go with them to Tarshish, away from the Lord.

<span id="an_1:4">1:4</span> And the Lord sent out a great wind on to
the sea and there was a violent storm in the sea, so that the ship
seemed in danger of being broken.

<span id="an_1:5">1:5</span> Then the sailors were full of fear, every
man crying to his god; and the goods in the ship were dropped out into
the sea to make the weight less. But Jonah had gone down into the inmost
part of the ship where he was stretched out in a deep sleep.

<span id="an_1:6">1:6</span> And the ship's captain came to him and said
to him, What are you doing sleeping? Up! say a prayer to your God, if by
chance God will give a thought to us, so that we may not come to
destruction.

<span id="an_1:7">1:7</span> And they said to one another, Come, let us
put this to the decision of chance and see on whose account this evil
has come on us. So they did so, and Jonah was seen to be the man.

<span id="an_1:8">1:8</span> Then they said to him, Now make clear to us
what is your work, and where you come from? what is your country, and
who are your people?

<span id="an_1:9">1:9</span> And he said to them, I am a Hebrew, a
worshipper of the Lord, the God of heaven, who made the sea and the dry
land.

<span id="an_1:10">1:10</span> And the men were in great fear, and they
said to him, What is this you have done? For the men had knowledge of
his flight from the Lord because he had not kept it from them.

<span id="an_1:11">1:11</span> And they said to him, What are we to do
to you so that the sea may become calm for us? For the sea was getting
rougher and rougher.

<span id="an_1:12">1:12</span> And he said to them, Take me up and put
me into the sea, and the sea will become calm for you: for I am certain
that because of me this great storm has come on you.

<span id="an_1:13">1:13</span> And the men were working hard to get back
to the land, but they were not able to do so: for the sea got rougher
and rougher against them.

<span id="an_1:14">1:14</span> So, crying to the Lord, they said, Give
ear to our prayer, O Lord, give ear, and do not let destruction overtake
us because of this man's life; do not put on us the sin of taking life
without cause: for you, O Lord, have done what seemed good to you.

<span id="an_1:15">1:15</span> So they took Jonah up and put him into
the sea: and the sea was no longer angry.

<span id="an_1:16">1:16</span> Then great was the men's fear of the
Lord; and they made an offering to the Lord and took oaths to him.

<span id="an_1:17">1:17</span> And the Lord made ready a great fish to
take Jonah into its mouth; and Jonah was inside the fish for three days
and three nights.

<span id="an_2:1">2:1</span> Then Jonah made prayer to the Lord his God
from the inside of the fish, and said,

<span id="an_2:2">2:2</span> In my trouble I was crying to the Lord, and
he gave me an answer; out of the deepest underworld I sent up a cry, and
you gave ear to my voice.

<span id="an_2:3">2:3</span> For you have put me down into the deep,
into the heart of the sea; and the river was round about me; all your
waves and your rolling waters went over me.

<span id="an_2:4">2:4</span> And I said, I have been sent away from
before your eyes; how may I ever again see your holy Temple?

<span id="an_2:5">2:5</span> The waters were circling round me, even to
the neck; the deep was about me; the sea-grass was twisted round my
head.

<span id="an_2:6">2:6</span> I went down to the bases of the mountains;
as for the earth, her walls were about me for ever: but you have taken
up my life from the underworld, O Lord my God.

<span id="an_2:7">2:7</span> When my soul in me was overcome, I kept the
memory of the Lord: and my prayer came in to you, into your holy Temple.

<span id="an_2:8">2:8</span> The worshippers of false gods have given up
their only hope.

<span id="an_2:9">2:9</span> But I will make an offering to you with the
voice of praise; I will give effect to my oaths. Salvation is the
Lord's.

<span id="an_2:10">2:10</span> And at the Lord's order, the fish sent
Jonah out of its mouth on to the dry land.

<span id="an_3:1">3:1</span> And the word of the Lord came to Jonah a
second time, saying,

<span id="an_3:2">3:2</span> Up! go to Nineveh, that great town, and
give it the word which I have given you.

<span id="an_3:3">3:3</span> So Jonah got up and went to Nineveh as the
Lord had said. Now Nineveh was a very great town, three days' journey
from end to end.

<span id="an_3:4">3:4</span> And Jonah first of all went a day's journey
into the town, and crying out said, In forty days destruction will
overtake Nineveh.

<span id="an_3:5">3:5</span> And the people of Nineveh had belief in
God; and a time was fixed for going without food, and they put on
haircloth, from the greatest to the least.

<span id="an_3:6">3:6</span> And the word came to the king of Nineveh,
and he got up from his seat of authority, and took off his robe, and
covering himself with haircloth, took his seat in the dust.

<span id="an_3:7">3:7</span> And he had it given out in Nineveh, By the
order of the king and his great men, no man or beast, herd or flock, is
to have a taste of anything; let them have no food or water:

<span id="an_3:8">3:8</span> And let man and beast be covered with
haircloth, and let them make strong prayers to God: and let everyone be
turned from his evil way and the violent acts of their hands.

<span id="an_3:9">3:9</span> Who may say that God will not be turned,
changing his purpose and turning away from his burning wrath, so that
destruction may not overtake us?

<span id="an_3:10">3:10</span> And God saw what they did, how they were
turned from their evil way; and God's purpose was changed as to the evil
which he said he would do to them, and he did it not.

<span id="an_4:1">4:1</span> But this seemed very wrong to Jonah, and he
was angry.

<span id="an_4:2">4:2</span> And he made prayer to the Lord and said, O
Lord, is this not what I said when I was still in my country? This is
why I took care to go in flight to Tarshish: for I was certain that you
were a loving God, full of pity, slow to be angry and great in mercy,
and ready to be turned from your purpose of evil.

<span id="an_4:3">4:3</span> So now, O Lord, give ear to my prayer and
take my life from me; for death is better for me than life.

<span id="an_4:4">4:4</span> And the Lord said, Have you any right to be
angry?

<span id="an_4:5">4:5</span> Then Jonah went out of the town, and took
his seat on the east side of the town and made himself a roof of
branches and took his seat under its shade till he saw what would become
of the town.

<span id="an_4:6">4:6</span> And the Lord God made a vine come up over
Jonah to give him shade over his head. And Jonah was very glad because
of the vine.

<span id="an_4:7">4:7</span> But early on the morning after, God made
ready a worm for the destruction of the vine, and it became dry and
dead.

<span id="an_4:8">4:8</span> Then when the sun came up, God sent a
burning east wind: and so great was the heat of the sun on his head that
Jonah was overcome, and, requesting death for himself, said, Death is
better for me than life.

<span id="an_4:9">4:9</span> And the Lord said to Jonah, Have you any
right to be angry about the vine? And he said, I have a right to be
truly angry.

<span id="an_4:10">4:10</span> And the Lord said, You had pity on the
vine, for which you did no work and for the growth of which you were not
responsible; which came up in a night and came to an end in a night;

<span id="an_4:11">4:11</span> And am I not to have mercy on Nineveh,
that great town, in which there are more than a hundred and twenty
thousand persons without the power of judging between right and left, as
well as much cattle?
