### Basic English Bible: 2 John

<span id="an_1:1">1:1</span> I, a ruler in the church, send word to the
noble sister who is of God's selection, and to her children, for whom I
have true love; and not only I, but all who have knowledge of what is
true;

<span id="an_1:2">1:2</span> Because of this true knowledge which is in
us, and will be with us for ever:

<span id="an_1:3">1:3</span> May grace, mercy, and peace be with us from
God the Father, and from Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in all
true love.

<span id="an_1:4">1:4</span> It gave me great joy to see some of your
children walking in the true way, even as we were ordered to do by the
Father.

<span id="an_1:5">1:5</span> And now, my sister, I make a request to
you, not sending you a new law, but the law which we had from the first,
that we have love for one another.

<span id="an_1:6">1:6</span> And love is the keeping of his laws. This
is the law which was given to you from the first, so that you might keep
it.

<span id="an_1:7">1:7</span> Because a number of false teachers have
gone out into the world, who do not give witness that Jesus Christ came
in the flesh. Such a one is a false teacher and Antichrist.

<span id="an_1:8">1:8</span> Keep watch over yourselves, so that you do
not make our work of no effect, but may get your full reward.

<span id="an_1:9">1:9</span> Anyone who goes on and does not keep to the
teaching of Christ, has not God: he who keeps to the teaching has the
Father and the Son.

<span id="an_1:10">1:10</span> If anyone comes to you not having this
teaching, do not take him into your house or give him words of love:

<span id="an_1:11">1:11</span> For he who gives him words of love has a
part in his evil works.

<span id="an_1:12">1:12</span> Having much to say to you, it is not my
purpose to put it all down with paper and ink: but I am hoping to come
to you, and to have talk with you face to face, so that your joy may be
full.

<span id="an_1:13">1:13</span> The children of your noble sister, who is
of God's selection, send you their love.
