### Basic English Bible: Ezra

<span id="an_1:1">1:1</span> Now in the first year of Cyrus, king of
Persia, in order that the word of the Lord given by the mouth of
Jeremiah might come true, the spirit of Cyrus, king of Persia, was moved
by the Lord, so that he made a public statement through all his kingdom,
and put it in writing, saying,

<span id="an_1:2">1:2</span> These are the words of Cyrus, king of
Persia: The Lord God of heaven has given me all the kingdoms of the
earth; and he has made me responsible for building a house for him in
Jerusalem, which is in Judah.

<span id="an_1:3">1:3</span> Whoever there is among you of his people,
may his God be with him, and let him go up to Jerusalem, which is in
Judah, and take in hand the building of the house of the Lord, the God
of Israel; he is the God who is in Jerusalem.

<span id="an_1:4">1:4</span> And whoever there may be of the rest of
Israel, living in any place, let the men of that place give him help
with offerings of silver and gold and goods and beasts, in addition to
the offering freely given for the house of God in Jerusalem.

<span id="an_1:5">1:5</span> Then the heads of families of Judah and
Benjamin, with the priests and the Levites, got ready, even all those
whose spirits were moved by God to go up and take in hand the building
of the Lord's house in Jerusalem.

<span id="an_1:6">1:6</span> And all their neighbours gave them help
with offerings of vessels of silver and gold and goods and beasts and
things of great value, in addition to what was freely offered.

<span id="an_1:7">1:7</span> And Cyrus the king got out the vessels of
the house of the Lord which Nebuchadnezzar had taken from Jerusalem and
put in the house of his gods;

<span id="an_1:8">1:8</span> Even these Cyrus made Mithredath, the
keeper of his wealth, get out, and he gave them, after numbering them,
to Sheshbazzar, the ruler of Judah.

<span id="an_1:9">1:9</span> And this is the number of them: there were
thirty gold plates, a thousand silver plates, twenty-nine knives,

<span id="an_1:10">1:10</span> Thirty gold basins, four hundred and ten
silver basins, and a thousand other vessels.

<span id="an_1:11">1:11</span> There were five thousand, four hundred
gold and silver vessels. All these were taken back by Sheshbazzar, when
those who had been taken prisoner went up from Babylon to Jerusalem.

<span id="an_2:1">2:1</span> Now these are the people of the divisions
of the kingdom, among those who had been made prisoners by
Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, and taken away to Babylon, who went
back to Jerusalem and Judah, everyone to his town;

<span id="an_2:2">2:2</span> Who went with Zerubbabel, Jeshua, Nehemiah,

<span id="an_2:55">2:55</span> The children of Solomon's servants: the

<span id="an_2:57">2:57</span> The children of Shephatiah, the children
of Hattil, the children of Pochereth-hazzebaim, the children of Ami.

<span id="an_2:58">2:58</span> All the Nethinim, and the children of
Solomon's servants, were three hundred and ninety-two.

<span id="an_2:59">2:59</span> And these were the people who went up
from Tel-melah, Tel-harsha, Cherub, Addan, and Immer. But having no
knowledge of their fathers' families or offspring, it was not certain
that they were Israelites;

<span id="an_2:60">2:60</span> The children of Delaiah, the children of
Tobiah, the children of Nekoda, six hundred and fifty-two.

<span id="an_2:61">2:61</span> And of the children of the priests: the
children of Habaiah, the children of Hakkoz, the children of Barzillai,
who was married to one of the daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite, and
took their name.

<span id="an_2:62">2:62</span> They made search for their record among
the lists of families, but their names were nowhere to be seen; so they
were looked on as unclean and no longer priests.

<span id="an_2:63">2:63</span> And the Tirshatha said that they were not
to have the most holy things for their food, till a priest came to give
decision by Urim and Thummim.

<span id="an_2:64">2:64</span> The number of all the people together was
forty-two thousand, three hundred and sixty,

<span id="an_2:65">2:65</span> As well as their men-servants and their
women-servants, of whom there were seven thousand, three hundred and
thirty-seven: and they had two hundred men and women to make music.

<span id="an_2:66">2:66</span> They had seven hundred and thirty-six
horses, two hundred and forty-five transport beasts,

<span id="an_2:67">2:67</span> Four hundred and thirty-five camels, six
thousand, seven hundred and twenty asses.

<span id="an_2:68">2:68</span> And some of the heads of families, when
they came to the house of the Lord which is in Jerusalem, gave freely of
their wealth for the building up of the house of God in its place:

<span id="an_2:69">2:69</span> Every one, as he was able, gave for the
work sixty-one thousand darics of gold, five thousand pounds of silver
and a hundred priests' robes.

<span id="an_2:70">2:70</span> So the priests and the Levites and the
people and the music-makers and the door-keepers and the Nethinim, took
up their places in their towns; even all Israel in their towns.

<span id="an_3:1">3:1</span> And when the seventh month came, and the
children of Israel were in the towns, the people came together like one
man to Jerusalem.

<span id="an_3:2">3:2</span> Then Jeshua, the son of Jozadak, and his
brothers the priests, and Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, with his
brothers, got up and made the altar of the God of Israel for burned
offerings as is recorded in the law of Moses, the man of God.

<span id="an_3:3">3:3</span> They put the altar on its base; for fear
was on them because of the people of the countries: and they made burned
offerings on it to the Lord, even burned offerings morning and evening.

<span id="an_3:4">3:4</span> And they kept the feast of tents, as it is
recorded, making the regular burned offerings every day by number, as it
is ordered; for every day what was needed.

<span id="an_3:5">3:5</span> And after that, the regular burned offering
and the offerings for the new moons and all the fixed feasts of the Lord
which had been made holy, and the offering of everyone who freely gave
his offering to the Lord.

<span id="an_3:6">3:6</span> From the first day of the seventh month
they made a start with the burned offerings, but the base of the Temple
of the Lord had still not been put in its place.

<span id="an_3:7">3:7</span> And they gave money to the stoneworkers and
woodworkers; and meat and drink and oil to the people of Zidon and of
Tyre, for the transport of cedar-trees from Lebanon to the sea, to
Joppa, as Cyrus, king of Persia, had given them authority to do.

<span id="an_3:8">3:8</span> Now in the second year of their coming into
the house of God in Jerusalem, in the second month, the work was taken
in hand by Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua, the son of
Jozadak, and the rest of their brothers the priests and the Levites, and
all those who had come from the land where they were prisoners to
Jerusalem: and they made the Levites, of twenty years old and over,
responsible for overseeing the work of the house of the Lord.

<span id="an_3:9">3:9</span> Then Jeshua with his sons and his brothers,
Kadmiel with his sons, the sons of Hodaviah, together took up the work
of overseeing the workmen in the house of God: the sons of Henadad with
their sons and their brothers, the Levites.

<span id="an_3:10">3:10</span> And when the builders put in position the
base of the Temple of the Lord, the priests, dressed in their robes,
took their places with horns, and the Levites, the sons of Asaph, with
brass instruments, to give praise to the Lord in the way ordered by
David, king of Israel.

<span id="an_3:11">3:11</span> And they gave praise to the Lord,
answering one another in their songs and saying, For he is good, for his
mercy to Israel is eternal. And all the people gave a great cry of joy,
when they gave praise to the Lord, because the base of the Lord's house
was put in place.

<span id="an_3:12">3:12</span> But a number of the priests and Levites
and the heads of families, old men who had seen the first house, when
the base of this house was put down before their eyes, were overcome
with weeping; and a number were crying out with joy:

<span id="an_3:13">3:13</span> So that in the ears of the people the cry
of joy was mixed with the sound of weeping; for the cries of the people
were loud and came to the ears of those who were a long way off.

<span id="an_4:1">4:1</span> Now news came to the haters of Judah and
Benjamin that the people who had come back were building a Temple to the
Lord, the God of Israel;

<span id="an_4:2">4:2</span> Then they came to Zerubbabel and to the
heads of families, and said to them, Let us take part in the building
with you; for we are servants of your God, even as you are; and we have
been making offerings to him from the days of Esar-haddon, king of
Assyria, who put us here.

<span id="an_4:3">4:3</span> But Zerubbabel and Jeshua and the rest of
the heads of families in Israel said to them, You have no part with us
in the building of a house for our God; we ourselves will do the work
together for the Lord, the God of Israel, as Cyrus, king of Persia, has
given us orders.

<span id="an_4:4">4:4</span> Then the people of the land made the hands
of the people of Judah feeble, troubling them with fear in their
building;

<span id="an_4:5">4:5</span> And they gave payment to men who made
designs against them and kept them from effecting their purpose, all
through the time of Cyrus, king of Persia, till Darius became king.

<span id="an_4:6">4:6</span> And in the time of Ahasuerus, when he first
became king, they put on record a statement against the people of Judah
and Jerusalem.

<span id="an_4:7">4:7</span> And in the time of Artaxerxes, Bishlam,
Mithredath, Tabeel, and the rest of his friends, sent a letter to
Artaxerxes, king of Persia, writing it in the Aramaean writing and
language.

<span id="an_4:8">4:8</span> Rehum, the chief ruler, and Shimshai the
scribe, sent a letter against Jerusalem, to Artaxerxes the king;

<span id="an_4:9">4:9</span> The letter was sent by Rehum, the chief
ruler, and Shimshai the scribe and their friends; the Dinaites and the
Apharsathchites, the Tarpelites, the Apharsites, the Archevites, the
Babylonians, the Shushanchites, the Dehaites, the Elamites,

<span id="an_4:10">4:10</span> And the rest of the nations which the
great and noble Osnappar took over and put in Samaria and the rest of
the country over the river:

<span id="an_4:11">4:11</span> This is a copy of the letter which they
sent to Artaxerxes the king: Your servants living across the river send
these words:

<span id="an_4:12">4:12</span> We give news to the king that the Jews
who came from you have come to us at Jerusalem; they are building up
again that uncontrolled and evil town; the walls are complete and they
are joining up the bases.

<span id="an_4:13">4:13</span> The king may be certain that when the
building of this town and its walls is complete, they will give no tax
or payment in goods or forced payments, and in the end it will be a
cause of loss to the kings.

<span id="an_4:14">4:14</span> Now because we are responsible to the
king, and it is not right for us to see the king's honour damaged, we
have sent to give the king word of these things,

<span id="an_4:15">4:15</span> So that search may be made in the book of
the records of your fathers: and you will see in the book of the records
that this town has been uncontrolled, and a cause of trouble to kings
and countries, and that there were outbursts against authority there in
the past: for which reason the town was made waste.

<span id="an_4:16">4:16</span> We give you word, that if the building of
this town and its walls is made complete, there will be an end of your
power in the country across the river.

<span id="an_4:17">4:17</span> Then the king sent an answer to Rehum,
the chief ruler, and Shimshai the scribe, and their friends living in
Samaria, and to the rest of those across the river, saying, Peace to
you:

<span id="an_4:18">4:18</span> And now the sense of the letter which you
sent to us has been made clear to me,

<span id="an_4:19">4:19</span> And I gave orders for a search to be
made, and it is certain that in the past this town has made trouble for
kings, and that outbursts against authority have taken place there.

<span id="an_4:20">4:20</span> Further, there have been great kings in
Jerusalem, ruling over all the country across the river, to whom they
gave taxes and payments in goods and forced payments.

<span id="an_4:21">4:21</span> Give an order now, that these men are to
do nothing more, and that the building of the town is to be stopped,
till I give an order.

<span id="an_4:22">4:22</span> Be certain to do this with all care: do
not let trouble be increased to the king's damage.

<span id="an_4:23">4:23</span> Then, after reading the king's letter,
Rehum and Shimshai the scribe and their friends went quickly to
Jerusalem, to the Jews, and had them stopped by force.

<span id="an_4:24">4:24</span> So the work of the house of God at
Jerusalem came to an end; so it was stopped, till the second year of the
rule of Darius, king of Persia.

<span id="an_5:1">5:1</span> Now the prophets Haggai and Zechariah, the
son of Iddo, were preaching to the Jews in Judah and Jerusalem in the
name of the God of Israel.

<span id="an_5:2">5:2</span> Then Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, and
Jeshua, the son of Jozadak, got up and made a start at building the
house of God at Jerusalem: and the prophets of God were with them,
helping them.

<span id="an_5:3">5:3</span> At the same time, Tattenai, ruler of the
land across the river, and Shethar-bozenai, and their men, came to them
and said, Who gave you orders to go on building this house and this
wall?

<span id="an_5:4">5:4</span> Then they said these words to them: What
are the names of the men who are at work on this building?

<span id="an_5:5">5:5</span> But the eye of their God was on the chiefs
of the Jews, and they did not make them give up working till the
question had been put before Darius and an answer had come by letter
about it.

<span id="an_5:6">5:6</span> This is a copy of the letter which
Tattenai, the ruler of the land across the river, and Shethar-bozenai
and his friends the Apharsachites, living across the river, sent to
Darius the king:

<span id="an_5:7">5:7</span> They sent him a letter saying, To Darius
the king, all peace:

<span id="an_5:8">5:8</span> This is to give the king word that we went
into the land of Judah, to the house of the great God, which is made of
great stones, and has its walls supported with wood, and the work is
going on with industry, and they are doing it well.

<span id="an_5:9">5:9</span> Then we said to the men responsible, who
gave you authority for the building of this house and these walls?

<span id="an_5:10">5:10</span> And we made request for their names, so
that we might send you word, and give you the names of the men at the
head of them.

<span id="an_5:11">5:11</span> And they made answer to us, saying, We
are the servants of the God of heaven and earth, and we are building the
house which was put up in times long past and was designed and made
complete by a great king of Israel.

<span id="an_5:12">5:12</span> But when the God of heaven was moved to
wrath by our fathers, he gave them up into the hands of Nebuchadnezzar,
king of Babylon, the Chaldaean, who sent destruction on this house and
took the people away into Babylon.

<span id="an_5:13">5:13</span> But in the first year of Cyrus, king of
Babylon, Cyrus the king gave an order for the building of this house of
God;

<span id="an_5:14">5:14</span> And the gold and silver vessels of the
house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar took from the Temple which was in
Jerusalem, and put into the house of his god in Babylon, these Cyrus the
king took from the house of his god in Babylon, and gave to one named
Sheshbazzar, whom he had made ruler;

<span id="an_5:15">5:15</span> And he said to him, Go, take these
vessels, and put them in the Temple in Jerusalem, and let the house of
God be put up again in its place.

<span id="an_5:16">5:16</span> Then this same Sheshbazzar came and put
the house of God in Jerusalem on its bases: and from that time till now
the building has been going on, but it is still not complete.

<span id="an_5:17">5:17</span> So now, if it seems good to the king, let
search be made in the king's store-house at Babylon, to see if it is
true that an order was given by Cyrus the king for the building of this
house of God at Jerusalem, and let the king send us word of his pleasure
in connection with this business.

<span id="an_6:1">6:1</span> Then Darius the king gave an order and a
search was made in the house of the records, where the things of value
were stored up in Babylon.

<span id="an_6:2">6:2</span> And at Achmetha, in the great house of the
king in the land of Media, they came across a roll, in which this
statement was put on record:

<span id="an_6:3">6:3</span> In the first year of Cyrus the king, Cyrus
the king made an order: In connection with the house of God at
Jerusalem, let the house be put up, the place where they make offerings,
and let the earth for the bases be put in place; let it be sixty cubits
high and sixty cubits wide;

<span id="an_6:4">6:4</span> With three lines of great stones and one
line of new wood supports; and let the necessary money be given out of
the king's store-house;

<span id="an_6:5">6:5</span> And let the gold and silver vessels from
the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar took from the Temple at Jerusalem
to Babylon, be given back and taken again to the Temple at Jerusalem,
every one in its place, and put them in the house of God.

<span id="an_6:6">6:6</span> So now, Tattenai, ruler of the land across
the river, and Shethar-bozenai and your people the Apharsachites across
the river, keep far from that place:

<span id="an_6:7">6:7</span> Let the work of this house of God go on;
let the ruler of the Jews and their responsible men put up this house of
God in its place.

<span id="an_6:8">6:8</span> Further, I give orders as to what you are
to do for the responsible men of the Jews in connection with the
building of this house of God: that from the king's wealth, that is,
from the taxes got together in the land over the river, the money needed
is to be given to these men readily, so that their work may not be
stopped.

<span id="an_6:9">6:9</span> And whatever they have need of, young oxen
and sheep and lambs, for burned offerings to the God of heaven, grain,
salt, wine, and oil, whatever the priests in Jerusalem say is necessary,
is to be given to them day by day regularly:

<span id="an_6:10">6:10</span> So that they may make offerings of a
sweet smell to the God of heaven, with prayers for the life of the king
and of his sons.

<span id="an_6:11">6:11</span> And I have given orders that if anyone
makes any change in this word, one of the supports is to be pulled out
of his house, and he is to be lifted up and fixed to it; and his house
is to be made waste for this;

<span id="an_6:12">6:12</span> And may the God who has made it a
resting-place for his name send destruction on all kings and peoples
whose hands are outstretched to make any change in this or to do damage
to this house of God at Jerusalem. I, Darius, have given this order, let
it be done with all care.

<span id="an_6:13">6:13</span> Then Tattenai, the ruler across the
river, and Shethar-bozenai and their people, because of the order given
by King Darius, did as he had said with all care.

<span id="an_6:14">6:14</span> And the responsible men of the Jews went
on with their building, and did well, helped by the teaching of Haggai
the prophet and Zechariah, the son of Iddo. They went on building till
it was complete, in keeping with the word of the God of Israel, and the
orders given by Cyrus, and Darius, and Artaxerxes, king of Persia.

<span id="an_6:15">6:15</span> And the building of this house was
complete on the third day of the month Adar, in the sixth year of the
rule of Darius the king.

<span id="an_6:16">6:16</span> And the children of Israel, the priests
and the Levites, and the rest of those who had come back, kept the feast
of the opening of this house of God with joy.

<span id="an_6:17">6:17</span> And they gave as offerings at the opening
of this house of God a hundred oxen, two hundred sheep, four hundred
lambs; and for a sin-offering for all Israel, twelve he-goats, being the
number of the tribes of Israel.

<span id="an_6:18">6:18</span> And they put the priests in their
divisions and the Levites in their order, for the worship of God at
Jerusalem; as it is recorded in the book of Moses.

<span id="an_6:19">6:19</span> And the children of Israel who had come
back kept the Passover on the fourteenth day of the first month.

<span id="an_6:20">6:20</span> For the priests and the Levites had made
themselves clean together; they were all clean: and they put the
Passover lamb to death for all those who had come back, and for their
brothers the priests and for themselves.

<span id="an_6:21">6:21</span> And the children of Israel, who had come
back, and all those who were joined to them, after separating themselves
from the evil ways of the people of the land to become the servants of
the Lord, the God of Israel, took food together,

<span id="an_6:22">6:22</span> And kept the feast of unleavened bread
for seven days with joy: for the Lord had made them full of joy, by
turning the heart of the king of Assyria to them to give them help in
the work of the house of God, the God of Israel.

<span id="an_7:1">7:1</span> Now after these things, when Artaxerxes was
king of Persia, Ezra, the son of Seraiah, the son of Azariah, the son of
Hilkiah,

<span id="an_7:2">7:2</span> The son of Shallum, the son of Zadok, the
son of Ahitub,

<span id="an_7:3">7:3</span> The son of Amariah, the son of Azariah, the
son of Meraioth,

<span id="an_7:4">7:4</span> The son of Zerahiah, the son of Uzzi, the
son of Bukki,

<span id="an_7:5">7:5</span> The son of Abishua, the son of Phinehas,
the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the chief priest:

<span id="an_7:6">7:6</span> This Ezra went up from Babylon; and he was
a scribe, expert in the law of Moses which the Lord, the God of Israel,
had given: and the king, moved by the Lord his God, gave him whatever he
made request for.

<span id="an_7:7">7:7</span> And some of the children of Israel went up,
with some of the priests and the Levites and the music-makers and the
door-keepers and the Nethinim, to Jerusalem, in the seventh year of
Artaxerxes the king.

<span id="an_7:8">7:8</span> And he came to Jerusalem in the fifth
month, in the seventh year of the king's rule.

<span id="an_7:9">7:9</span> For, starting his journey from Babylon on
the first day of the first month, he came to Jerusalem on the first day
of the fifth month, by the good help of his God.

<span id="an_7:10">7:10</span> For Ezra had given his mind to learning
the law of the Lord and doing it, and to teaching his rules and
decisions in Israel.

<span id="an_7:11">7:11</span> Now this is a copy of the letter which
King Artaxerxes gave to Ezra, the priest and the scribe, who put into
writing the words of the orders of the Lord, and of his rules for
Israel:

<span id="an_7:12">7:12</span> Artaxerxes, king of kings, to Ezra the
priest, scribe of the law of the God of heaven, all peace;

<span id="an_7:13">7:13</span> And now it is my order that all those of
the people of Israel, and their priests and Levites in my kingdom, who
are ready and have a desire to go to Jerusalem, are to go with you.

<span id="an_7:14">7:14</span> Because you are sent by the king and his
seven wise men, to get knowledge about Judah and Jerusalem, as you are
ordered by the law of your God which is in your hand;

<span id="an_7:15">7:15</span> And to take with you the silver and gold
freely offered by the king and his wise men to the God of Israel, whose
Temple is in Jerusalem,

<span id="an_7:16">7:16</span> As well as all the silver and gold which
you get from the land of Babylon, together with the offering of the
people and of the priests, freely given for the house of their God,
which is in Jerusalem:

<span id="an_7:17">7:17</span> So with this money get with care oxen,
sheep, and lambs, with their meal offerings and their drink offerings,
to be offered on the altar of the house of your God, which is in
Jerusalem.

<span id="an_7:18">7:18</span> And whatever seems right to you and to
your brothers to do with the rest of the silver and gold, that do, as
may be pleasing to your God.

<span id="an_7:19">7:19</span> And the vessels which have been given to
you for the uses of the house of your God, you are to give to the God of
Jerusalem.

<span id="an_7:20">7:20</span> And whatever more is needed for the house
of your God, and which you may have to give, take it from the king's
store-house.

<span id="an_7:21">7:21</span> And I, even I, Artaxerxes the king, now
give orders to all keepers of the king's money across the river, that
whatever Ezra the priest, the scribe of the law of the God of heaven,
may have need of from you, is to be done with all care,

<span id="an_7:22">7:22</span> Up to a hundred talents of silver, a
hundred measures of grain, a hundred measures of wine, and a hundred
measures of oil, and salt without measure.

<span id="an_7:23">7:23</span> Whatever is ordered by the God of heaven,
let it be done completely for the house of the God of heaven; so that
there may not be wrath against the kingdom of the king and his sons.

<span id="an_7:24">7:24</span> In addition, we make it clear to you,
that it will be against the law to put any tax or payment in goods or
forced payment on any of the priests or Levites, the music-makers,
door-keepers, Nethinim, or any servants of this house of God.

<span id="an_7:25">7:25</span> And you, Ezra, by the wisdom of your God
which is in you, are to put rulers and judges to have authority over all
the people across the river who have knowledge of the laws of your God;
and you are to give teaching to him who has no knowledge of them.

<span id="an_7:26">7:26</span> And if anyone does not keep the law of
your God and the law of the king, take care that punishment is given to
him, by death or by driving him from his country or by taking away his
goods or by putting him in prison.

<span id="an_7:27">7:27</span> Praise be to the Lord, the God of our
fathers, who has put such a thing into the heart of the king, to make
fair the house of the Lord which is in Jerusalem;

<span id="an_7:28">7:28</span> And has given mercy to me before the king
and his government and before all the king's great captains. And I was
made strong by the hand of the Lord my God which was on me, and I got
together out of Israel chief men to go up with me.

<span id="an_8:1">8:1</span> Now these are the heads of families who
were listed of those who went up with me from Babylon, when Artaxerxes
was king.

<span id="an_8:2">8:2</span> Of the sons of Phinehas, Gershom; of the
sons of Ithamar, Daniel; of the sons of David, Hattush;

<span id="an_8:3">8:3</span> Of the sons of Shecaniah; of the sons of
Parosh, Zechariah; and with him were listed a hundred and fifty males.

<span id="an_8:4">8:4</span> Of the sons of Pahath-moab, Eliehoenai, the
son of Zerahiah; and with him two hundred males.

<span id="an_8:5">8:5</span> Of the sons of Shecaniah, the son of
Jahaziel; and with him three hundred males.

<span id="an_8:6">8:6</span> And of the sons of Adin, Ebed, the son of
Jonathan; and with him fifty males.

<span id="an_8:7">8:7</span> And of the sons of Elam, Jeshaiah; the son
of Athaliah; and with him seventy males.

<span id="an_8:8">8:8</span> And of the sons of Shephatiah, Zebadiah,
the son of Michael; and with him eighty males.

<span id="an_8:9">8:9</span> Of the sons of Joab, Obadiah, the son of
Jehiel; and with him two hundred and eighteen males.

<span id="an_8:10">8:10</span> And of the sons of Shelomith, the son of
Josiphiah; and with him a hundred and sixty males.

<span id="an_8:11">8:11</span> And of the sons of Bebai, Zechariah, the
son of Bebai; and with him twenty-eight males.

<span id="an_8:12">8:12</span> And of the sons of Azgad, Johanan, the
son of Hakkatan; and with him a hundred and ten males.

<span id="an_8:13">8:13</span> And of the sons of Adonikam, the last,
whose names were Eliphelet, Jeuel, and Shemaiah; and with them sixty
males.

<span id="an_8:14">8:14</span> And of the sons of Bigvai, Uthai and
Zabbud; and with them seventy males.

<span id="an_8:15">8:15</span> And I made them come together by the
river flowing to Ahava; and we were there in tents for three days: and
after viewing the people and the priests I saw that no sons of Levi were
there.

<span id="an_8:16">8:16</span> Then I sent for Eliezer and Ariel and
Shemaiah and Elnathan Jarib and Elnathan and Nathan and Zechariah and
Meshullam, all responsible men; and for Joiarib and Elnathan, who were
wise men.

<span id="an_8:17">8:17</span> And I sent them to Iddo the chief at the
place Casiphia, and gave them orders what to say to Iddo and his
brothers the Nethinim at the place Casiphia, so that they might come
back to us with men to do the work of the house of our God.

<span id="an_8:18">8:18</span> And by the help of our God they got for
us Ish-sechel, one of the sons of Mahli, the son of Levi, the son of
Israel; and Sherebiah with his sons and brothers, eighteen;

<span id="an_8:19">8:19</span> And Hashabiah, and with him Jeshaiah of
the sons of Merari, his brothers and their sons, twenty;

<span id="an_8:20">8:20</span> And of the Nethinim, to whom David and
the captains had given the work of helping the Levites, two hundred and
twenty Nethinim, all of them specially named.

<span id="an_8:21">8:21</span> Then I gave orders for a time of going
without food, there by the river Ahava, so that we might make ourselves
low before our God in prayer, requesting from him a straight way for us
and for our little ones and for all our substance.

<span id="an_8:22">8:22</span> For I would not, for shame, make request
to the king for a band of armed men and horsemen to give us help against
those who might make attacks on us on the way: for we had said to the
king, The hand of our God is on his servants for good, but his power and
his wrath are against all those who are turned away from him.

<span id="an_8:23">8:23</span> So we went without food, requesting our
God for this: and his ear was open to our prayer.

<span id="an_8:24">8:24</span> So I put on one side twelve of the chiefs
of the priests, Sherebiah, Hashabiah, and ten of their brothers with
them,

<span id="an_8:25">8:25</span> And gave to them by weight the silver and
the gold and the vessels, all the offering for the house of our God
which the king and his wise men and his captains and all Israel there
present had given:

<span id="an_8:26">8:26</span> Measuring into their hands six hundred
and fifty talents of silver, and silver vessels, a hundred talents'
weight, and a hundred talents of gold,

<span id="an_8:27">8:27</span> And twenty gold basins, of a thousand
darics, and two vessels of the best bright brass, equal in value to
gold.

<span id="an_8:28">8:28</span> And I said to them, You are holy to the
Lord and the vessels are holy: and the silver and the gold are an
offering freely given to the Lord, the God of your fathers.

<span id="an_8:29">8:29</span> Take care of them and keep them, till you
put them on the scales before the chiefs of the priests and the Levites
and the chiefs of the families of Israel, in Jerusalem, in the rooms of
the house of the Lord.

<span id="an_8:30">8:30</span> So the priests and the Levites took the
weight of silver and gold and the vessels, to take them to Jerusalem
into the house of our God.

<span id="an_8:31">8:31</span> Then we went away from the river of Ahava
on the twelfth day of the first month, to go to Jerusalem; and the hand
of our God was on us, and he gave us salvation from our haters and those
who were waiting to make an attack on us by the way.

<span id="an_8:32">8:32</span> And we came to Jerusalem and were there
for three days.

<span id="an_8:33">8:33</span> And on the fourth day, the silver and the
gold and the vessels were measured out by weight in the house of our God
into the hands of Meremoth, the son of Uriah, the priest; and with him
was Eleazar, the son of Phinehas; and with them were Jozabad, the son of
Jeshua, and Noadiah, the son of Binnui, the Levites;

<span id="an_8:34">8:34</span> All was handed over by number and by
weight: and the weight was put on record at that time.

<span id="an_8:35">8:35</span> And those who had been prisoners, who had
come back from a strange land, made burned offerings to the God of
Israel, twelve oxen for all Israel, ninety-six male sheep, seventy-seven
lambs, twelve he-goats for a sin-offering: all this was a burned
offering to the Lord.

<span id="an_8:36">8:36</span> And they gave the king's orders to the
king's captains and the rulers across the river, and they gave the
people and the house of God the help which was needed.

<span id="an_9:1">9:1</span> Now after these things were done, the
captains came to me and said, The people of Israel and the priests and
Levites have not kept themselves separate from the people of the lands,
but have taken part in the disgusting ways of the Canaanites, the
Hittites, the Perizzites, the Jebusites, the Ammonites, the Moabites,
the Egyptians, and the Amorites.

<span id="an_9:2">9:2</span> For they have taken their daughters for
themselves and for their sons, so that the holy seed has been mixed with
the peoples of the lands; and in fact the captains and rulers have been
the first to do this evil.

<span id="an_9:3">9:3</span> And hearing this, with signs of grief and
pulling out the hair of my head and my chin, I took my seat on the earth
deeply troubled.

<span id="an_9:4">9:4</span> Then everyone who went in fear of the words
of the God of Israel, because of the sin of those who had come back,
came together to me; and I kept where I was, overcome with grief, till
the evening offering.

<span id="an_9:5">9:5</span> And at the evening offering, having made
myself low before God, I got up, and with signs of grief, falling down
on my knees, with my hands stretched out to the Lord my God,

<span id="an_9:6">9:6</span> I said, O my God, shame keeps me from
lifting up my face to you, my God: for our sins are increased higher
than our heads and our evil-doing has come up to heaven.

<span id="an_9:7">9:7</span> From the days of our fathers till this day
we have been great sinners; and for our sins, we and our kings and our
priests have been given up into the hands of the kings of the lands, to
the sword and to prison and to loss of goods and to shame of face, as it
is this day.

<span id="an_9:8">9:8</span> And now for a little time grace has come to
us from the Lord our God, to let a small band of us get free and to give
us a nail in his holy place, so that our God may give light to our eyes
and a measure of new life in our prison chains.

<span id="an_9:9">9:9</span> For we are servants; but our God has not
been turned away from us in our prison, but has had mercy on us before
the eyes of the kings of Persia, to give us new strength to put up again
the house of our God and to make fair its waste places, and to give us a
wall in Judah and Jerusalem.

<span id="an_9:10">9:10</span> And now, O our God, what are we to say
after this? for we have not kept your laws,

<span id="an_9:11">9:11</span> Which you gave to your servants the
prophets, saying, The land into which you are going, to take it for a
heritage, is an unclean land, because of the evil lives of the peoples
of the land and their disgusting ways, which have made the land unclean
from end to end.

<span id="an_9:12">9:12</span> So now do not give your daughters to
their sons or take their daughters for your sons or do anything for
their peace or well-being for ever; so that you may be strong, living on
the good of the land, and handing it on to your children for a heritage
for ever.

<span id="an_9:13">9:13</span> And after everything which has come on us
because of our evil-doing and our great sin, and seeing that the
punishment which you, O God, have given us, is less than the measure of
our sins, and that you have kept from death those of us who are here;

<span id="an_9:14">9:14</span> Are we again to go against your orders,
taking wives from among the people who do these disgusting things? would
you not be angry with us till our destruction was complete, till there
was not one who got away safe?

<span id="an_9:15">9:15</span> O Lord God of Israel, righteousness is
yours; we are only a small band which has been kept from death, as at
this day: see, we are before you in our sin; for no one may keep his
place before you because of this.

<span id="an_10:1">10:1</span> Now while Ezra was making his prayer and
his statement of wrongdoing, weeping and falling down before the house
of God, a very great number of men and women and children out of Israel
came together round him: for the people were weeping bitterly.

<span id="an_10:2">10:2</span> And Shecaniah, the son of Jehiel, one of
the sons of Elam, answering, said to Ezra, We have done evil against our
God, and have taken as our wives strange women of the peoples of the
land: but still there is hope for Israel in this question.

<span id="an_10:3">10:3</span> Let us now make an agreement with our God
to put away all the wives and all their children, if it seems right to
my lord and to those who go in fear of the words of our God; and let it
be done in keeping with the law.

<span id="an_10:4">10:4</span> Up, now! for this is your business, and
we are with you; take heart and do it.

<span id="an_10:5">10:5</span> Then Ezra got up, and made the chiefs of
the priests and the Levites and all Israel take an oath that they would
do this. So they took an oath.

<span id="an_10:6">10:6</span> Then Ezra got up from before the house of
God and went into the room of Jehohanan, the son of Eliashib; but when
he came there, he took no food or drink, for he was sorrowing for the
sin of those who had come back.

<span id="an_10:7">10:7</span> And they made a public statement through
all Judah and Jerusalem, to all those who had come back, that they were
to come together to Jerusalem;

<span id="an_10:8">10:8</span> And that if anyone did not come before
three days were past, as ordered by the rulers and the responsible men,
all his goods would be put under the curse, and he himself would be cut
off from the meeting of the people who had come back.

<span id="an_10:9">10:9</span> Then all the men of Judah and Benjamin
came together to Jerusalem before three days were past; it was the ninth
month, on the twentieth day of the month; and all the people were seated
in the wide square in front of the house of God, shaking with fear
because of this business and because of the great rain.

<span id="an_10:10">10:10</span> And Ezra the priest got to his feet and
said to them, You have done wrong and taken strange women for your
wives, so increasing the sin of Israel.

<span id="an_10:11">10:11</span> So now, give praise to the Lord, the
God of your fathers, and do his pleasure; and make yourselves separate
from the peoples of the land and from the strange women.

<span id="an_10:12">10:12</span> Then all the people, answering, said
with a loud voice, As you have said, so it is right for us to do.

<span id="an_10:13">10:13</span> But the number of people is great, and
it is a time of much rain; it is not possible for us to go on waiting
outside, and this is not a thing which may be done in one day or even
two: for our sin in this business is great.

<span id="an_10:14">10:14</span> So now let our rulers be
representatives for all the people, and let all those in our towns who
are married to strange women come at fixed times, and with them the
responsible men and the judges of every town, till the burning wrath of
our God is turned away from us, and this has been done.

<span id="an_10:15">10:15</span> Only Jonathan, the son of Asahel, and
Jahzeiah, the son of Tikvah, were against this, Meshullam and Shabbethai
the Levite supporting them.

<span id="an_10:16">10:16</span> So those who had come back did so. And
Ezra the priest, with certain heads of families, by their fathers'
families, all of them by their names, were marked out; and on the first
day of the tenth month they took their places to go into the question
with care.

<span id="an_10:17">10:17</span> And they got to the end of all the men
who were married to strange women by the first day of the first month.

<span id="an_10:18">10:18</span> And among the sons of the priests who
were married to strange women were these: of the sons of Jeshua, the son
of Jozadak and his brothers, Maaseiah and Eliezer and Jarib and
Gedaliah.

<span id="an_10:19">10:19</span> And they gave their word that they
would put away their wives; and for their sin, they gave an offering of
a male sheep of the flock.

<span id="an_10:20">10:20</span> And of the sons of Immer, Hanani and
Zebadiah.

<span id="an_10:21">10:21</span> And of the sons of Harim, Maaseiah and
Elijah and Shemaiah and Jehiel and Uzziah.

<span id="an_10:22">10:22</span> And of the sons of Pashhur, Elioenai,
Maaseiah, Ishmael, Nethanel, Jozabad, and Elasah.

<span id="an_10:23">10:23</span> And of the Levites, Jozabad, and
Shimei, and Kelaiah (that is Kelita), Pethahiah, Judah, and Eliezer.

<span id="an_10:24">10:24</span> And of the music-makers, Eliashib; and
of the door-keepers, Shallum and Telem and Uri.

<span id="an_10:25">10:25</span> And of Israel, the sons of Parosh,
Ramiah and Izziah and Malchijah and Mijamin and Eleazar and Malchijah
and Benaiah.

<span id="an_10:26">10:26</span> And of the sons of Elam, Mattaniah,
Zechariah, and Jehiel and Abdi and Jeremoth and Elijah.

<span id="an_10:27">10:27</span> And of the sons of Zattu, Elioenai,
Eliashib, Mattaniah, and Jeremoth and Zabad and Aziza.

<span id="an_10:28">10:28</span> And of the sons of Bebai, Jehohanan,
Hananiah, Zabbai, Athlai.

<span id="an_10:29">10:29</span> And of the sons of Bani, Meshullam,
Malluch, and Adaiah, Jashub and Sheal, Jeremoth.

<span id="an_10:30">10:30</span> And of the sons of Pahath-moab, Adna
and Chelal, Benaiah, Maaseiah, Mattaniah, Bezalel and Binnui and
Manasseh.

<span id="an_10:31">10:31</span> And of the sons of Harim, Eliezer,
Isshijah, Malchijah, Shemaiah, Shimeon,

<span id="an_10:32">10:32</span> Benjamin, Malluch, Shemariah.

<span id="an_10:33">10:33</span> Of the sons of Hashum, Mattenai,
Mattattah, Zabad, Eliphelet, Jeremai, Manasseh, Shimei.

<span id="an_10:34">10:34</span> Of the sons of Bani, Maadai, Amram, and
