### Basic English Bible: Habakkuk

<span id="an_1:1">1:1</span> The word which Habakkuk the prophet saw.

<span id="an_1:2">1:2</span> How long, O Lord, will your ears be shut to
my voice? I make an outcry to you about violent behaviour, but you do
not send salvation.

<span id="an_1:3">1:3</span> Why do you make me see evil-doing, and why
are my eyes fixed on wrong? for wasting and violent acts are before me:
and there is fighting and bitter argument.

<span id="an_1:4">1:4</span> For this reason the law is feeble and
decisions are not effected: for the upright man is circled round by
evil-doers; because of which right is twisted.

<span id="an_1:5">1:5</span> See among the nations, and take note, and
be full of wonder: for in your days I am doing a work in which you will
have no belief, even if news of it is given to you.

<span id="an_1:6">1:6</span> For see, I am sending the Chaldaeans, that
bitter and quick-moving nation; who go through the wide spaces of the
earth to get for themselves living-places which are not theirs.

<span id="an_1:7">1:7</span> They are greatly to be feared: their right
comes from themselves.

<span id="an_1:8">1:8</span> And their horses are quicker than leopards
and their horsemen more cruel than evening wolves; they come from far
away, like an eagle in flight rushing on its food.

<span id="an_1:9">1:9</span> They are coming all of them with force; the
direction of their faces is forward, the number of their prisoners is
like the sands of the sea.

<span id="an_1:10">1:10</span> He makes little of kings, rulers are a
sport to him; all the strong places are to be laughed at; for he makes
earthworks and takes them.

<span id="an_1:11">1:11</span> Then his purpose will be changed,
over-stepping the limit; he will make his strength his god.

<span id="an_1:12">1:12</span> Are you not eternal, O Lord my God, my
Holy One? for you there is no death. O Lord, he has been ordered by you
for our punishment; and by you, O Rock, he has been marked out to put us
right.

<span id="an_1:13">1:13</span> Before your holy eyes sin may not be
seen, and you are unable to put up with wrong; why, then, are your eyes
on the false? why do you say nothing when the evil-doer puts an end to
one who is more upright than himself?

<span id="an_1:14">1:14</span> He has made men like the fishes of the
sea, like the worms which have no ruler over them.

<span id="an_1:15">1:15</span> He takes them all up with his hook, he
takes them in his net, getting them together in his fishing-net: for
which cause he is glad and full of joy.

<span id="an_1:16">1:16</span> For this reason he makes an offering to
his net, burning perfume to his fishing-net; because by them he gets
much food and his meat is fat.

<span id="an_1:17">1:17</span> For this cause his net is ever open, and
there is no end to his destruction of the nations.

<span id="an_2:1">2:1</span> I will take my position and be on watch,
placing myself on my tower, looking out to see what he will say to me,
and what answer he will give to my protest.

<span id="an_2:2">2:2</span> And the Lord gave me an answer, and said,
Put the vision in writing and make it clear on stones, so that the
reader may go quickly.

<span id="an_2:3">2:3</span> For the vision is still for the fixed time,
and it is moving quickly to the end, and it will not be false: even if
it is slow in coming, go on waiting for it; because it will certainly
come, it will not be kept back.

<span id="an_2:4">2:4</span> As for the man of pride, my soul has no
pleasure in him; but the upright man will have life through his good
faith.

<span id="an_2:5">2:5</span> A curse on the cruel and false one! the man
full of pride, who never has enough; who makes his desires wide as the
underworld! he is like death; he is never full, but he makes all nations
come to him, getting all peoples together to himself.

<span id="an_2:6">2:6</span> Will not all these take up a word of shame
against him and a bitter saying against him, and say, A curse on him who
goes on taking what is not his and is weighted down with the property of
debtors!

<span id="an_2:7">2:7</span> Will not your creditors suddenly be moved
against you, and your troublers get up from their sleep, and you will be
to them like goods taken in war?

<span id="an_2:8">2:8</span> Because you have taken their goods from
great nations, all the rest of the peoples will take your goods from
you; because of men's blood and violent acts against the land and the
town and all who are living in it.

<span id="an_2:9">2:9</span> A curse on him who gets evil profits for
his family, so that he may put his resting-place on high and be safe
from the hand of the wrongdoer!

<span id="an_2:10">2:10</span> You have been a cause of shame to your
house by cutting off a number of peoples, and sinning against your soul.

<span id="an_2:11">2:11</span> For the stone will give a cry out of the
wall, and it will be answered by the board out of the woodwork.

<span id="an_2:12">2:12</span> A curse on him who is building a place
with blood, and basing a town on evil-doing!

<span id="an_2:13">2:13</span> See, is it not the pleasure of the Lord
of armies that the peoples are working for the fire and using themselves
up for nothing?

<span id="an_2:14">2:14</span> For the earth will be full of the
knowledge of the glory of the Lord as the sea is covered by the waters.

<span id="an_2:15">2:15</span> A curse on him who gives his neighbour
the wine of his wrath, making him overcome with strong drink from the
cup of his passion, so that you may be a witness of their shame!

<span id="an_2:16">2:16</span> You are full of shame in place of glory:
take your part in the drinking, and let your shame be uncovered: the cup
of the Lord's right hand will come round to you and your glory will be
covered with shame.

<span id="an_2:17">2:17</span> For the violent acts against Lebanon will
come on you, and the destruction of the cattle will be a cause of fear
to you, because of men's blood and the violent acts against the land and
the town and all who are living in it.

<span id="an_2:18">2:18</span> What profit is the pictured image to its
maker? and as for the metal image, the false teacher, why does its maker
put his faith in it, making false gods without a voice?

<span id="an_2:19">2:19</span> A curse on him who says to the wood,
Awake! to the unbreathing stone, Up! let it be a teacher! See, it is
plated with gold and silver, and there is no breath at all inside it.

<span id="an_2:20">2:20</span> But the Lord is in his holy Temple: let
all the earth be quiet before him.

<span id="an_3:1">3:1</span> A prayer of Habakkuk the prophet, put to
Shigionoth.

<span id="an_3:2">3:2</span> O Lord, word of you has come to my ears; I
have seen your work, O Lord; when the years come near make it clear; in
wrath keep mercy in mind.

<span id="an_3:3">3:3</span> God came from Teman, and the Holy One from
Mount Paran. Selah. The heavens were covered with his glory, and the
earth was full of his praise.

<span id="an_3:4">3:4</span> He was shining like the light; he had rays
coming out from his hand: there his power was kept secret.

<span id="an_3:5">3:5</span> Before him went disease, and flames went
out at his feet.

<span id="an_3:6">3:6</span> From his high place he sent shaking on the
earth; he saw and nations were suddenly moved: and the eternal mountains
were broken, the unchanging hills were bent down; his ways are eternal.

<span id="an_3:7">3:7</span> The curtains of Cushan were troubled, and
the tents of Midian were shaking.

<span id="an_3:8">3:8</span> Was your wrath burning against the rivers?
were you angry with the sea, that you went on your horses, on your
war-carriages of salvation?

<span id="an_3:9">3:9</span> Your bow was quite uncovered. Selah. By you
the earth was cut through with rivers.

<span id="an_3:10">3:10</span> The mountains saw you and were moved with
fear; the clouds were streaming with water: the voice of the deep was
sounding; the sun did not come up, and the moon kept still in her place.

<span id="an_3:11">3:11</span> At the light of your arrows they went
away, at the shining of your polished spear.

<span id="an_3:12">3:12</span> You went stepping through the land in
wrath, crushing the nations in your passion.

<span id="an_3:13">3:13</span> You went out for the salvation of your
people, for the salvation of the one on whom your holy oil was put;
wounding the head of the family of the evil-doer, uncovering the base
even to the neck. Selah.

<span id="an_3:14">3:14</span> You have put your spears through his
head, his horsemen were sent in flight like dry stems; they had joy in
driving away the poor, in making a meal of them secretly.

<span id="an_3:15">3:15</span> The feet of your horses were on the sea,
on the mass of great waters.

<span id="an_3:16">3:16</span> Hearing it, my inner parts were moved,
and my lips were shaking at the sound; my bones became feeble, and my
steps were uncertain under me: I gave sounds of grief in the day of
trouble, when his forces came up against the people in bands.

<span id="an_3:17">3:17</span> For though the fig-tree has no flowers,
and there is no fruit on the vine, and work on the olive comes to
nothing, and the fields give no food; and the flock is cut off from its
resting-place, and there is no herd in the cattle-house:

<span id="an_3:18">3:18</span> Still, I will be glad in the Lord, my joy
will be in the God of my salvation.

<span id="an_3:19">3:19</span> The Lord God is my strength, and he makes
my feet like roes' feet, guiding me on my high places. For the chief
music-maker on corded instruments.
