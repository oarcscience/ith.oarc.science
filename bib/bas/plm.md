### Basic English Bible: Philemon

<span id="an_1:1">1:1</span> Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ, and
Timothy our brother, to Philemon, our dear helper in the faith,

<span id="an_1:2">1:2</span> And to Apphia, our sister, and to
Archippus, our brother in God's army, and to the church in your house:

<span id="an_1:3">1:3</span> Grace to you and peace from God our Father
and the Lord Jesus Christ.

<span id="an_1:4">1:4</span> I give praise to God at all times and make
prayer for you,

<span id="an_1:5">1:5</span> Hearing of the love and the faith which you
have to the Lord Jesus and to all the saints;

<span id="an_1:6">1:6</span> That the faith which you have in common
with them may be working with power, in the knowledge of every good
thing in you, for Christ.

<span id="an_1:7">1:7</span> For I had great joy and comfort in your
love, because the hearts of the saints have been made strong again
through you, brother.

<span id="an_1:8">1:8</span> And so, though I might, in the name of
Christ, give you orders to do what is right,

<span id="an_1:9">1:9</span> Still, because of love, in place of an
order, I make a request to you, I, Paul, an old man and now a prisoner
of Christ Jesus:

<span id="an_1:10">1:10</span> My request is for my child Onesimus, the
child of my chains,

<span id="an_1:11">1:11</span> Who in the past was of no profit to you,
but now is of profit to you and to me:

<span id="an_1:12">1:12</span> Whom I have sent back to you, him who is
my very heart:

<span id="an_1:13">1:13</span> Though my desire was to keep him with me,
to be my servant in the chains of the good news, in your place:

<span id="an_1:14">1:14</span> But without your approval I would do
nothing; so that your good works might not be forced, but done freely
from your heart.

<span id="an_1:15">1:15</span> For it is possible that for this reason
he was parted from you for a time, so that you might have him for ever;

<span id="an_1:16">1:16</span> No longer as a servant, but more than a
servant, a brother, very dear to me specially, but much more to you, in
the flesh as well as in the Lord.

<span id="an_1:17">1:17</span> If then you take me to be your friend and
brother, take him in as myself.

<span id="an_1:18">1:18</span> If he has done you any wrong or is in
debt to you for anything, put it to my account.

<span id="an_1:19">1:19</span> I, Paul, writing this myself, say, I will
make payment to you: and I do not say to you that you are in debt to me
even for your life.

<span id="an_1:20">1:20</span> So brother, let me have joy of you in the
Lord: give new life to my heart in Christ.

<span id="an_1:21">1:21</span> Being certain that you will do my desire,
I am writing to you, in the knowledge that you will do even more than I
say.

<span id="an_1:22">1:22</span> And make a room ready for me; for I am
hoping that through your prayers I will be given to you.

<span id="an_1:23">1:23</span> Epaphras, my brother-prisoner in Christ
Jesus, sends you his love;

<span id="an_1:24">1:24</span> And so do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and
Luke, my brother-workers.

<span id="an_1:25">1:25</span> The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be
with your spirit. So be it.
