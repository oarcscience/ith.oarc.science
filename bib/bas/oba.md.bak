### Basic English Bible: Obadiah

<span id="an_1:1">1:1</span> The vision of Obadiah. This is what the
Lord has said about Edom: We have had word from the Lord, and a
representative has been sent among the nations, saying, Up! and let us
make war against her.

<span id="an_1:2">1:2</span> See, I have made you small among the
nations: you are much looked down on.

<span id="an_1:3">1:3</span> You have been tricked by the pride of your
heart, O you whose living-place is in the cracks of the rock, whose
house is high up; who has said in his heart, Who will make me come down
to earth?

<span id="an_1:4">1:4</span> Though you go up on high like an eagle,
though your house is placed among the stars, I will make you come down
from there, says the Lord.

<span id="an_1:5">1:5</span> If thieves came, attacking you by night,
(how are you cut off!) would they not go on taking till they had enough?
if men came cutting your grapes would they take them all?

<span id="an_1:6">1:6</span> How are the things of Esau searched out!
how are his secret stores looked for!

<span id="an_1:7">1:7</span> All the men who were united with you have
been false to you, driving you out to the edge of the land: the men who
were at peace with you have overcome you; they have taken their heritage
in your place.

<span id="an_1:8">1:8</span> Will I not, in that day, says the Lord,
take away the wise men out of Edom, and wisdom out of the mountain of
Esau?

<span id="an_1:9">1:9</span> And your men of war, O Teman, will be
overcome with fear, so that every one of them may be cut off from the
mountain of Esau.

<span id="an_1:10">1:10</span> Because you were the cause of violent
death and because of your cruel behaviour to your brother Jacob, you
will be covered with shame and will be cut off for ever.

<span id="an_1:11">1:11</span> Because you were there watching when men
from other lands took away his goods, and strange men came into his
doors, and put the fate of Jerusalem to the decision of chance; you were
like one of them.

<span id="an_1:12">1:12</span> Do not see with pleasure your brother's
evil day, the day of his fate, and do not be glad over the children of
Judah on the day of their destruction, or make wide your mouth on the
day of trouble.

<span id="an_1:13">1:13</span> Do not go into the doors of my people on
the day of their downfall; do not be looking on their trouble with
pleasure on the day of their downfall, or put your hands on their goods
on the day of their downfall.

<span id="an_1:14">1:14</span> And do not take your place at the
cross-roads, cutting off those of his people who get away; and do not
give up to their haters those who are still there in the day of trouble.

<span id="an_1:15">1:15</span> For the day of the Lord is coming quickly
on all nations: as you have done it will be done to you; the reward of
your acts will come on your head.

<span id="an_1:16">1:16</span> For as you have been drinking on my holy
mountain, so will all the nations go on drinking without end; they will
go on drinking and the wine will go down their throats, and they will be
as if they had never been.

<span id="an_1:17">1:17</span> But in Mount Zion some will be kept safe,
and it will be holy; and the children of Jacob will take their heritage.

<span id="an_1:18">1:18</span> And the children of Jacob will be a fire
and those of Joseph a flame, and the children of Esau dry stems of
grass, burned up by them till all is gone: and there will be no people
living in Esau; for the Lord has said it.

<span id="an_1:19">1:19</span> And they will take the South, and the
lowland, and the country of Ephraim, and Gilead, as their heritage.

<span id="an_1:20">1:20</span> And those of the children of Israel who
were the first to be taken away as prisoners, will have their heritage
among the Canaanites as far as Zarephath; and those who were taken away
from Jerusalem, who are in Sepharad, will have the towns of the South.

<span id="an_1:21">1:21</span> And those who have been kept safe will
come up from Mount Zion to be judges of the mountain of Esau; and the
kingdom will be the Lord's.
