### Basic English Bible: Philippians

<span id="an_1:1">1:1</span> Paul and Timothy, servants of Jesus Christ,
to all the saints in Christ Jesus at Philippi, with the Bishops and
Deacons of the church:

<span id="an_1:2">1:2</span> Grace to you and peace from God our Father
and the Lord Jesus Christ.

<span id="an_1:3">1:3</span> I give praise to my God at every memory of
you,

<span id="an_1:4">1:4</span> And in all my prayers for you all, making
my request with joy,

<span id="an_1:5">1:5</span> Because of your help in giving the good
news from the first day till now;

<span id="an_1:6">1:6</span> For I am certain of this very thing, that
he by whom the good work was started in you will make it complete till
the day of Jesus Christ:

<span id="an_1:7">1:7</span> So it is right for me to take thought for
you all in this way, because I have you in my heart; for in my chains,
and in my arguments before the judges in support of the good news,
making clear that it is true, you all have your part with me in grace.

<span id="an_1:8">1:8</span> For God is my witness, how my love goes out
to you all in the loving mercies of Christ Jesus.

<span id="an_1:9">1:9</span> And my prayer is that you may be increased
more and more in knowledge and experience;

<span id="an_1:10">1:10</span> So that you may give your approval to the
best things; that you may be true and without wrongdoing till the day of
Christ;

<span id="an_1:11">1:11</span> Being full of the fruits of
righteousness, which are through Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise
of God.

<span id="an_1:12">1:12</span> Now it is my purpose to make clear to
you, brothers, that the cause of the good news has been helped by my
experiences;

<span id="an_1:13">1:13</span> So that it became clear through all the
Praetorium, and to all the rest, that I was a prisoner on account of
Christ;

<span id="an_1:14">1:14</span> And most of the brothers in the Lord,
taking heart because of my chains, are all the stronger to give the word
of God without fear.

<span id="an_1:15">1:15</span> Though some are preaching Christ out of
envy and competition, others do it out of a good heart:

<span id="an_1:16">1:16</span> These do it from love, conscious that I
am responsible for the cause of the good news:

<span id="an_1:17">1:17</span> But those are preaching Christ in a
spirit of competition, not from their hearts, but with the purpose of
giving me pain in my prison.

<span id="an_1:18">1:18</span> What then? only that in every way,
falsely or truly, the preaching of Christ goes on; and in this I am
glad, and will be glad.

<span id="an_1:19">1:19</span> For I am conscious that this will be for
my salvation, through your prayer and the giving out of the stored
wealth of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,

<span id="an_1:20">1:20</span> In the measure of my strong hope and
belief that in nothing will I be put to shame, but that without fear, as
at all times, so now will Christ have glory in my body, by life or by
death.

<span id="an_1:21">1:21</span> For to me life is Christ and death is
profit.

<span id="an_1:22">1:22</span> But if I go on living in the flesh--if
this is the fruit of my work--then I do not see what decision to make.

<span id="an_1:23">1:23</span> I am in a hard position between the two,
having a desire to go away and be with Christ, which is very much
better:

<span id="an_1:24">1:24</span> Still, to go on in the flesh is more
necessary because of you.

<span id="an_1:25">1:25</span> And being certain of this, I am conscious
that I will go on, yes, and go on with you all, for your growth and joy
in the faith;

<span id="an_1:26">1:26</span> So that your pride in me may be increased
in Christ Jesus through my being present with you again.

<span id="an_1:27">1:27</span> Only let your behaviour do credit to the
good news of Christ, so that if I come and see you or if I am away from
you, I may have news of you that you are strong in one spirit, working
together with one soul for the faith of the good news;

<span id="an_1:28">1:28</span> Having no fear of those who are against
you; which is a clear sign of their destruction, but of your salvation,
and that from God;

<span id="an_1:29">1:29</span> Because to you it has been given in the
cause of Christ not only to have faith in him, but to undergo pain on
his account:

<span id="an_1:30">1:30</span> Fighting the same fight which you saw in
me, and now have word of in me.

<span id="an_2:1">2:1</span> If then there is any comfort in Christ, any
help given by love, any uniting of hearts in the Spirit, any loving
mercies and pity,

<span id="an_2:2">2:2</span> Make my joy complete by being of the same
mind, having the same love, being in harmony and of one mind;

<span id="an_2:3">2:3</span> Doing nothing through envy or through
pride, but with low thoughts of self let everyone take others to be
better than himself;

<span id="an_2:4">2:4</span> Not looking everyone to his private good,
but keeping in mind the things of others.

<span id="an_2:5">2:5</span> Let this mind be in you which was in Christ
Jesus,

<span id="an_2:6">2:6</span> To whom, though himself in the form of God,
it did not seem that to take for oneself was to be like God;

<span id="an_2:7">2:7</span> But he made himself as nothing, taking the
form of a servant, being made like men;

<span id="an_2:8">2:8</span> And being seen in form as a man, he took
the lowest place, and let himself be put to death, even the death of the
cross.

<span id="an_2:9">2:9</span> For this reason God has put him in the
highest place and has given to him the name which is greater than every
name;

<span id="an_2:10">2:10</span> So that at the name of Jesus every knee
may be bent, of those in heaven and those on earth and those in the
underworld,

<span id="an_2:11">2:11</span> And that every tongue may give witness
that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.

<span id="an_2:12">2:12</span> So then, my loved ones, as you have at
all times done what I say, not only when I am present, but now much more
when I am not with you, give yourselves to working out your salvation
with fear in your hearts;

<span id="an_2:13">2:13</span> For it is God who is the cause of your
desires and of your acts, for his good pleasure.

<span id="an_2:14">2:14</span> Do all things without protests and
arguments;

<span id="an_2:15">2:15</span> So that you may be holy and gentle,
children of God without sin in a twisted and foolish generation, among
whom you are seen as lights in the world,

<span id="an_2:16">2:16</span> Offering the word of life; so that I may
have glory in you in the day of Christ, because my running was not for
nothing and my work was not without effect.

<span id="an_2:17">2:17</span> And even if I am offered like a drink
offering, giving myself for the cause and work of your faith, I am glad
and have joy with you all:

<span id="an_2:18">2:18</span> And in the same way do you be glad and
have a part in my joy.

<span id="an_2:19">2:19</span> But I am hoping in the Lord Jesus to send
Timothy to you before long, so that I may be comforted when I have news
of you.

<span id="an_2:20">2:20</span> For I have no man of like mind who will
truly have care for you.

<span id="an_2:21">2:21</span> For they all go after what is theirs, not
after the things of Christ.

<span id="an_2:22">2:22</span> But his quality is clear to you; how, as
a child is to its father, so he was a help to me in the work of the good
news.

<span id="an_2:23">2:23</span> Him then I am hoping to send as quickly
as possible, when I am able to see how things will go for me:

<span id="an_2:24">2:24</span> But I have faith in the Lord that I
myself will come before long.

<span id="an_2:25">2:25</span> But it seemed to me necessary to send to
you Epaphroditus, my brother, who has taken part with me in the work and
in the fight, and your servant, sent by you for help in my need;

<span id="an_2:26">2:26</span> Because his heart was with you all, and
he was greatly troubled because you had news that he was ill:

<span id="an_2:27">2:27</span> For in fact he was ill almost to death:
but God had mercy on him; and not only on him but on me, so that I might
not have grief on grief.

<span id="an_2:28">2:28</span> I have sent him, then, the more gladly,
so that when you see him again, you may be happy and I may have the less
sorrow.

<span id="an_2:29">2:29</span> So take him to your hearts in the Lord
with all joy, and give honour to such as he is:

<span id="an_2:30">2:30</span> Because for the work of Christ he was
near to death, putting his life in danger to make your care for me
complete.

<span id="an_3:1">3:1</span> For the rest, my brothers, be glad in the
Lord. Writing the same things to you is no trouble to me, and for you it
is safe.

<span id="an_3:2">3:2</span> Be on the watch against dogs, against the
workers of evil, against those of the circumcision:

<span id="an_3:3">3:3</span> For we are the circumcision, who give
worship to God and have glory in Jesus Christ, and have no faith in the
flesh:

<span id="an_3:4">3:4</span> Even though I myself might have faith in
the flesh: if any other man has reason to have faith in the flesh, I
have more:

<span id="an_3:5">3:5</span> Being given circumcision on the eighth day,
of the nation of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of Hebrews;
in relation to the law, a Pharisee:

<span id="an_3:6">3:6</span> In bitter hate I was cruel to the church; I
kept all the righteousness of the law to the last detail.

<span id="an_3:7">3:7</span> But those things which were profit to me, I
gave up for Christ.

<span id="an_3:8">3:8</span> Yes truly, and I am ready to give up all
things for the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord, which is more than
all: for whom I have undergone the loss of all things, and to me they
are less than nothing, so that I may have Christ as my reward,

<span id="an_3:9">3:9</span> And be seen in him, not having my
righteousness which is of the law, but that which is through faith in
Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith:

<span id="an_3:10">3:10</span> That I may have knowledge of him, and of
the power of his coming back from the dead, and a part with him in his
pains, becoming like him in his death;

<span id="an_3:11">3:11</span> If in any way I may have the reward of
life from the dead.

<span id="an_3:12">3:12</span> Not as if I had even now got the reward
or been made complete: but I go on in the hope that I may come to the
knowledge of that for which I was made the servant of Christ Jesus.

<span id="an_3:13">3:13</span> Brothers, it is clear to me that I have
not come to that knowledge; but one thing I do, letting go those things
which are past, and stretching out to the things which are before,

<span id="an_3:14">3:14</span> I go forward to the mark, even the reward
of the high purpose of God in Christ Jesus.

<span id="an_3:15">3:15</span> Then let us all, who have come to full
growth, be of this mind: and if in anything you are of a different mind,
even this will God make clear to you:

<span id="an_3:16">3:16</span> Only, as far as we have got, let us be
guided by the same rule.

<span id="an_3:17">3:17</span> Brothers, take me as your example, and
take note of those who are walking after the example we have given.

<span id="an_3:18">3:18</span> For there are those, of whom I have given
you word before, and do so now with sorrow, who are haters of the cross
of Christ;

<span id="an_3:19">3:19</span> Whose end is destruction, whose god is
the stomach, and whose glory is in their shame, whose minds are fixed on
the things of the earth.

<span id="an_3:20">3:20</span> For our country is in heaven; from where
the Saviour for whom we are waiting will come, even the Lord Jesus
Christ:

<span id="an_3:21">3:21</span> By whom this poor body of ours will be
changed into the image of the body of his glory, in the measure of the
working by which he is able to put all things under himself.

<span id="an_4:1">4:1</span> So my brothers, well loved and very dear to
me, my joy and crown, be strong in the Lord, my loved ones.

<span id="an_4:2">4:2</span> I make request to Euodias and Syntyche to
be of the same mind in the Lord.

<span id="an_4:3">4:3</span> And I make request to you, true helper in
my work, to see to the needs of those women who took part with me in the
good news, with Clement and the rest of my brother-workers whose names
are in the book of life.

<span id="an_4:4">4:4</span> Be glad in the Lord at all times: again I
say, Be glad.

<span id="an_4:5">4:5</span> Let your gentle behaviour be clear to all
men. The Lord is near.

<span id="an_4:6">4:6</span> Have no cares; but in everything with
prayer and praise put your requests before God.

<span id="an_4:7">4:7</span> And the peace of God, which is deeper than
all knowledge, will keep your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus.

<span id="an_4:8">4:8</span> For the rest, my brothers, whatever things
are true, whatever things have honour, whatever things are upright,
whatever things are holy, whatever things are beautiful, whatever things
are of value, if there is any virtue and if there is any praise, give
thought to these things.

<span id="an_4:9">4:9</span> The things which came to you by my teaching
and preaching, and which you saw in me, these things do, and the God of
peace will be with you.

<span id="an_4:10">4:10</span> But I am very glad in the Lord that your
care for me has come to life again; though you did in fact take thought
for me, but you were not able to give effect to it.

<span id="an_4:11">4:11</span> But I will not say anything about my
needs, for I am able, wherever I am, to be dependent on myself.

<span id="an_4:12">4:12</span> It is the same to me if I am looked down
on or honoured; everywhere and in all things I have the secret of how to
be full and how to go without food; how to have wealth and how to be in
need.

<span id="an_4:13">4:13</span> I am able to do all things through him
who gives me strength.

<span id="an_4:14">4:14</span> But you did well to have care for me in
my need.

<span id="an_4:15">4:15</span> And you have knowledge, Philippians, that
when the good news first came to you, when I went away from Macedonia,
no church took part with me in the business of giving to the saints, but
you only;

<span id="an_4:16">4:16</span> Because even in Thessalonica you sent
once and again to me in my need.

<span id="an_4:17">4:17</span> Not that I am looking for an offering,
but for fruit which may be put to your credit.

<span id="an_4:18">4:18</span> I have all things and more than enough: I
am made full, having had from Epaphroditus the things which came from
you, a perfume of a sweet smell, an offering well pleasing to God.

<span id="an_4:19">4:19</span> And my God will give you all you have
need of from the wealth of his glory in Christ Jesus.

<span id="an_4:20">4:20</span> Now to God our Father be glory for ever
and ever. So be it.

<span id="an_4:21">4:21</span> Give words of love to every saint in
Christ Jesus. The brothers who are with me send you their love.

<span id="an_4:22">4:22</span> All the saints send their love to you,
specially those who are of Caesar's house.

<span id="an_4:23">4:23</span> The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be
with your spirit.
