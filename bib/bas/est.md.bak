### Basic English Bible: Esther

<span id="an_1:1">1:1</span> Now it came about in the days of Ahasuerus,
(that Ahasuerus who was ruler of a hundred and twenty-seven divisions of
the kingdom, from India as far as Ethiopia:)

<span id="an_1:2">1:2</span> That in those days, when King Ahasuerus was
ruling in Shushan, his strong town,

<span id="an_1:3">1:3</span> In the third year of his rule he gave a
feast to all his captains and his servants; and the captains of the army
of Persia and Media, the great men and the rulers of the divisions of
his kingdom, were present before him;

<span id="an_1:4">1:4</span> And for a long time, even a hundred and
eighty days, he let them see all the wealth and the glory of his kingdom
and the great power and honour which were his.

<span id="an_1:5">1:5</span> And at the end of that time, the king gave
a feast for all the people who were present in Shushan, the king's town,
small as well as great, for seven days, in the outer square of the
garden of the king's house.

<span id="an_1:6">1:6</span> There were fair hangings of white and green
and blue, fixed with cords of purple and the best linen to silver rings
and pillars of polished stone: the seats were of gold and silver on a
floor of red and white and yellow and black stone.

<span id="an_1:7">1:7</span> And they gave them drink in gold vessels,
every vessel being different, and wine of the kingdom, freely given by
the king.

<span id="an_1:8">1:8</span> And the drinking was in keeping with the
law; no one was forced: for the king had given orders to all the chief
servants of his house to do as was pleasing to every man.

<span id="an_1:9">1:9</span> And Vashti the queen gave a feast for the
women in the house of King Ahasuerus.

<span id="an_1:10">1:10</span> On the seventh day, when the heart of the
king was glad with wine, he gave orders to Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona,
Bigtha, and Abagtha, Zethar, and Carcas, the seven unsexed servants who
were waiting before Ahasuerus the king,

<span id="an_1:11">1:11</span> That Vashti the queen was to come before
him, crowned with her crown, and let the people and the captains see
her: for she was very beautiful.

<span id="an_1:12">1:12</span> But when the servants gave her the king's
order, Vashti the queen said she would not come: then the king was very
angry, and his heart was burning with wrath.

<span id="an_1:13">1:13</span> And the king said to the wise men, who
had knowledge of the times, (for this was the king's way with all who
were expert in law and in the giving of decisions:

<span id="an_1:14">1:14</span> And second only to him were Carshena,
Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, and Memucan, the seven
rulers of Persia and Media, who were friends of the king, and had the
first places in the kingdom:)

<span id="an_1:15">1:15</span> What is to be done by law to Vashti the
queen, because she has not done what King Ahasuerus, by his servants,
gave her orders to do?

<span id="an_1:16">1:16</span> And before the king and the captains,
Memucan gave his answer: Vashti the queen has done wrong, not only to
the king, but to all the captains and to all the peoples in all the
divisions of the kingdom of King Ahasuerus;

<span id="an_1:17">1:17</span> For news of what the queen has done will
come to the ears of all women, and they will no longer give respect to
their husbands when it is said to them, King Ahasuerus gave orders for
Vashti the queen to come before him and she came not.

<span id="an_1:18">1:18</span> And the wives of the captains of Persia
and Media, hearing what the queen has done, will say the same to all the
king's captains. So there will be much shame and wrath.

<span id="an_1:19">1:19</span> If it is pleasing to the king, let an
order go out from him, and let it be recorded among the laws of the
Persians and the Medes, so that it may never be changed, that Vashti is
never again to come before King Ahasuerus; and let the king give her
place to another who is better than she.

<span id="an_1:20">1:20</span> And when this order, given by the king,
is made public through all his kingdom (for it is great), all the wives
will give honour to their husbands, great as well as small.

<span id="an_1:21">1:21</span> And this suggestion seemed good to the
king and the captains; and the king did as Memucan said;

<span id="an_1:22">1:22</span> And sent letters to all the divisions of
the kingdom, to every division in the writing commonly used there, and
to every people in the language which was theirs, saying that every man
was to be the ruler in his house, and that this order was to be given
out in the language of his people.

<span id="an_2:1">2:1</span> After these things, when the king's
feelings were calmer, the thought of Vashti and what she had done and
the order he had made against her, came back to his mind.

<span id="an_2:2">2:2</span> Then the servants who were waiting on the
king said to him, Let search be made for some fair young virgins for the
king:

<span id="an_2:3">2:3</span> Let the king give authority to certain men
in all the divisions of his kingdom, to get together all the fair young
virgins and send them to Shushan, the king's town, to the women's house,
under the care of Hegai, the king's servant, the keeper of the women:
and let the things needed for making them clean be given to them;

<span id="an_2:4">2:4</span> And let the girl who is pleasing to the
king be queen in place of Vashti. And the king was pleased with this
suggestion; and he did so.

<span id="an_2:5">2:5</span> Now there was a certain Jew in Shushan
named Mordecai, the son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son of Kish, a
Benjamite;

<span id="an_2:6">2:6</span> Who had been taken away from Jerusalem
among those who had been made prisoner with Jeconiah, king of Judah,
when Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, had taken him away.

<span id="an_2:7">2:7</span> And he had been a father to Hadassah, that
is Esther, the daughter of his father's brother: for she had no father
or mother, and she was very beautiful; and when her father and mother
were dead, Mordecai took her for his daughter.

<span id="an_2:8">2:8</span> So when the order made by the king was
publicly given out, and a number of girls had been placed in the care of
Hegai in the king's house in Shushan, Esther was taken into the king's
house and put in the care of Hegai, the keeper of the women.

<span id="an_2:9">2:9</span> And he was pleased with the girl and was
kind to her; and he quickly gave her what was needed for making her
clean, and the things which were hers by right, and seven servant-girls
who were to be hers from the king's house: and he had her and her
servant-girls moved to the best place in the women's part of the house.

<span id="an_2:10">2:10</span> Esther had not said what family or people
she came from, for Mordecai had given her orders not to do so.

<span id="an_2:11">2:11</span> And every day Mordecai took his walk
before the square of the women's house, to see how Esther was and what
would be done to her.

<span id="an_2:12">2:12</span> Now every girl, when her turn came, had
to go in to King Ahasuerus, after undergoing, for a space of twelve
months, what was ordered by the law for the women (for this was the time
necessary for making them clean, that is, six months with oil of myrrh
and six months with sweet perfumes and such things as are needed for
making women clean):

<span id="an_2:13">2:13</span> And in this way the girl went in to the
king; whatever she had a desire for was given to her to take with her
from the women's house into the house of the king.

<span id="an_2:14">2:14</span> In the evening she went, and on the day
after she came back to the second house of the women, into the keeping
of Shaashgaz, one of the king's unsexed servants who had the care of the
king's wives: only if the king had delight in her and sent for her by
name did she go in to him again.

<span id="an_2:15">2:15</span> Now when the time came for Esther, the
daughter of Abihail, his father's brother, whom Mordecai had taken as
his daughter, to go in to the king, she made request for nothing but
what Hegai, the king's servant and keeper of the women, had given her.
And Esther was looked on kindly by all who saw her.

<span id="an_2:16">2:16</span> So Esther was taken in to King Ahasuerus
in his house in the tenth month, which is the month Tebeth, in the
seventh year of his rule.

<span id="an_2:17">2:17</span> And Esther was more pleasing to the king
than all the women, and to his eyes she was fairer and more full of
grace than all the other virgins: so he put his crown on her head and
made her queen in place of Vashti.

<span id="an_2:18">2:18</span> Then the king gave a great feast for all
his captains and his servants, even Esther's feast; and he gave orders
through all the divisions of his kingdom for a day of rest from work,
and gave wealth from his store.

<span id="an_2:19">2:19</span> And when the virgins came together in the
second house of the women, Mordecai took his seat in the doorway of the
king's house.

<span id="an_2:20">2:20</span> Esther had still said nothing of her
family or her people, as Mordecai had given her orders; for Esther did
what Mordecai said, as when she was living with him.

<span id="an_2:21">2:21</span> In those days, while Mordecai was seated
at the king's doorway, two of the king's servants, Bigthan and Teresh,
keepers of the door, being angry, were looking for a chance to make an
attack on King Ahasuerus.

<span id="an_2:22">2:22</span> And Mordecai, having knowledge of their
purpose, sent word of it to Esther the queen; and Esther gave the news
to the king in Mordecai's name.

<span id="an_2:23">2:23</span> And when the thing had been looked into,
it was seen to be true, and the two of them were put to death by hanging
on a tree: and it was put down in the records before the king.

<span id="an_3:1">3:1</span> After these things, by the order of the
king, Haman, the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, was lifted up and given
a position of honour and a higher place than all the other captains who
were with him.

<span id="an_3:2">3:2</span> And all the king's servants who were in the
king's house went down to the earth before Haman and gave him honour:
for so the king had given orders. But Mordecai did not go down before
him or give him honour.

<span id="an_3:3">3:3</span> Then the king's servants who were in the
king's house said to Mordecai, Why do you go against the king's order?

<span id="an_3:4">3:4</span> Now when they had said this to him day
after day and he gave no attention, they let Haman have news of it, to
see if Mordecai's behaviour would be overlooked: for he had said to them
that he was a Jew.

<span id="an_3:5">3:5</span> And when Haman saw that Mordecai did not go
down before him and give him honour, Haman was full of wrath.

<span id="an_3:6">3:6</span> But it was not enough for him to make an
attack on Mordecai only; for they had made clear to him who Mordecai's
people were; so Haman made it his purpose to put an end to all the Jews,
even Mordecai's people, through all the kingdom of Ahasuerus.

<span id="an_3:7">3:7</span> In the first month, the month Nisan, in the
twelfth year of King Ahasuerus, from day to day and from month to month
they went on looking for a sign given by Pur (that is chance) before
Haman, till the sign came out for the thirteenth day of the twelfth
month, the month Adar.

<span id="an_3:8">3:8</span> And Haman said to King Ahasuerus, There is
a certain nation living here and there in small groups among the people
in all the divisions of your kingdom; their laws are different from
those of any other nation, and they do not keep the king's laws: for
this reason it is not right for the king to let them be.

<span id="an_3:9">3:9</span> If it is the king's pleasure, let a
statement ordering their destruction be put in writing: and I will give
to those responsible for the king's business, ten thousand talents of
silver for the king's store-house.

<span id="an_3:10">3:10</span> And the king took his ring from his hand
and gave it to Haman, the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the hater of
the Jews.

<span id="an_3:11">3:11</span> And the king said to Haman, The money is
yours, and the people, to do with them whatever seems right to you.

<span id="an_3:12">3:12</span> Then on the thirteenth day of the first
month, the king's scribes were sent for, and they put in writing Haman's
orders to all the king's captains and the rulers of every division of
his kingdom and the chiefs of every people: for every division of the
kingdom in the writing commonly used there, and to every people in the
language which was theirs; it was signed in the name of King Ahasuerus
and stamped with the king's ring.

<span id="an_3:13">3:13</span> And letters were sent by the runners into
every division of the kingdom ordering the death and destruction of all
Jews, young and old, little children and women, on the same day, even
the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, the month Adar, and the taking
of all their goods by force.

<span id="an_3:14">3:14</span> A copy of the writing, to be made public
in every part of the kingdom, was sent out to all the peoples, so that
they might be ready when that day came.

<span id="an_3:15">3:15</span> The runners went out quickly by the
king's order, and a public statement was made in Shushan: and the king
and Haman took wine together: but the town of Shushan was troubled.

<span id="an_4:1">4:1</span> Now when Mordecai saw what was done,
pulling off his robe, he put on haircloth, with dust on his head, and
went out into the middle of the town, crying out with a loud and bitter
cry.

<span id="an_4:2">4:2</span> And he came even before the king's doorway;
for no one might come inside the king's door clothed in haircloth.

<span id="an_4:3">4:3</span> And in every part of the kingdom, wherever
the king's word and his order came, there was great sorrow among the
Jews, and weeping and crying and going without food; and numbers of them
were stretched on the earth covered with dust and haircloth.

<span id="an_4:4">4:4</span> And Esther's women and her servants came
and gave her word of it. Then great was the grief of the queen: and she
sent robes for Mordecai, so that his clothing of haircloth might be
taken off; but he would not have them.

<span id="an_4:5">4:5</span> Then Esther sent for Hathach, one of the
king's unsexed servants whom he had given her for waiting on her, and
she gave him orders to go to Mordecai and see what this was and why it
was.

<span id="an_4:6">4:6</span> So Hathach went out and saw Mordecai in the
open square of the town before the king's doorway.

<span id="an_4:7">4:7</span> And Mordecai gave him an account of what
had taken place, and of the amount of money which Haman had said he
would put into the king's store for the destruction of the Jews.

<span id="an_4:8">4:8</span> And he gave him the copy of the order which
had been given out in Shushan for their destruction, ordering him to let
Esther see it, and to make it clear to her; and to say to her that she
was to go in to the king, requesting his mercy, and making prayer for
her people.

<span id="an_4:9">4:9</span> And Hathach came back and gave Esther an
account of what Mordecai had said.

<span id="an_4:10">4:10</span> Then Esther sent Hathach to say to
Mordecai:

<span id="an_4:11">4:11</span> It is common knowledge among all the
king's servants and the people of every part of the kingdom, that if
anyone, man or woman, comes to the king in his inner room without being
sent for, there is only one law for him, that he is to be put to death;
only those to whom the king's rod of gold is stretched out may keep
their lives: but I have not been sent for to come before the king these
thirty days.

<span id="an_4:12">4:12</span> And they said these words to Mordecai.

<span id="an_4:13">4:13</span> Then Mordecai sent this answer back to
Esther: Do not have the idea that you in the king's house will be safe
from the fate of all the Jews.

<span id="an_4:14">4:14</span> If at this time you say nothing, then
help and salvation will come to the Jews from some other place, but you
and your father's family will come to destruction: and who is to say
that you have not come to the kingdom even for such a time as this?

<span id="an_4:15">4:15</span> Then Esther sent them back to Mordecai
with this answer:

<span id="an_4:16">4:16</span> Go, get together all the Jews who are
present in Shushan, and go without food for me, taking no food or drink
night or day for three days: and I and my women will do the same; and so
I will go in to the king, which is against the law: and if death is to
be my fate, then let it come.

<span id="an_4:17">4:17</span> So Mordecai went away and did everything
as Esther had said.

<span id="an_5:1">5:1</span> Now on the third day, Esther put on her
queen's robes, and took her place in the inner room of the king's house,
facing the king's house: and the king was seated on his high seat in the
king's house, facing the doorway of the house.

<span id="an_5:2">5:2</span> And when the king saw Esther the queen
waiting in the inner room, looking kindly on her he put out the rod of
gold in his hand to her. So Esther came near and put her fingers on the
top of the rod.

<span id="an_5:3">5:3</span> Then the king said, What is your desire,
Queen Esther, and what is your request? I will give it to you, even to
the half of my kingdom.

<span id="an_5:4">5:4</span> And Esther in answer said, If it seems good
to the king, let the king and Haman come today to the feast which I have
made ready for him.

<span id="an_5:5">5:5</span> Then the king said, Let Haman come quickly,
so that what Esther has said may be done. So the king and Haman came to
the feast which Esther had made ready.

<span id="an_5:6">5:6</span> And while they were drinking wine the king
said to Esther, What is your prayer? for it will be given to you and
what is your request? for it will be done, even to the half of my
kingdom.

<span id="an_5:7">5:7</span> Then Esther said in answer, My prayer and
my request is this:

<span id="an_5:8">5:8</span> If I have the king's approval, and if it is
the king's pleasure to give me my prayer and do my request, let the king
and Haman come to the feast which I will make ready for them, and
tomorrow I will do as the king has said.

<span id="an_5:9">5:9</span> Then on that day Haman went out full of joy
and glad in heart; but when he saw Mordecai in the king's doorway, and
he did not get to his feet or give any sign of fear before him, Haman
was full of wrath against Mordecai.

<span id="an_5:10">5:10</span> But controlling himself, he went to his
house; and he sent for his friends and Zeresh, his wife.

<span id="an_5:11">5:11</span> And he gave them an account of the
glories of his wealth, and the number of children he had, and the ways
in which he had been honoured by the king, and how he had put him over
the captains and servants of the king.

<span id="an_5:12">5:12</span> And Haman said further, Truly, Esther the
queen let no man but myself come in to the feast which she had made
ready for the king; and tomorrow again I am to be her guest with the
king.

<span id="an_5:13">5:13</span> But all this is nothing to me while I see
Mordecai the Jew seated by the king's doorway.

<span id="an_5:14">5:14</span> Then his wife Zeresh and all his friends
said to him, Let a pillar, fifty cubits high, be made ready for hanging
him, and in the morning get the king to give orders for the hanging of
Mordecai: then you will be able to go to the feast with the king with a
glad heart. And Haman was pleased with the suggestion, and he had the
pillar made.

<span id="an_6:1">6:1</span> That night the king was unable to get any
sleep; and he sent for the books of the records; and while some one was
reading them to the king,

<span id="an_6:2">6:2</span> It came out that it was recorded in the
book how Mordecai had given word of the designs of Bigthana and Teresh,
two of the king's servants, keepers of the door, by whom an attack on
the king had been designed.

<span id="an_6:3">6:3</span> And the king said, What honour and reward
have been given to Mordecai for this? Then the servants who were waiting
on the king said, Nothing has been done for him.

<span id="an_6:4">6:4</span> Then the king said, Who is in the outer
room? Now Haman had come into the outer room to get the king's authority
for the hanging of Mordecai on the pillar which he had made ready for
him.

<span id="an_6:5">6:5</span> And the king's servants said to him, See,
Haman is waiting in the outer room. And the king said, Let him come in.

<span id="an_6:6">6:6</span> So Haman came in. And the king said to him,
What is to be done to the man whom the king has delight in honouring?
Then the thought came into Haman's mind, Whom, more than myself, would
the king have pleasure in honouring?

<span id="an_6:7">6:7</span> And Haman, answering the king, said, For
the man whom the king has delight in honouring,

<span id="an_6:8">6:8</span> Let them take the robes which the king
generally puts on, and the horse on which the king goes, and the crown
which is on his head:

<span id="an_6:9">6:9</span> And let the robes and the horse be given to
one of the king's most noble captains, so that they may put them on the
man whom the king has delight in honouring, and let him go on horseback
through the streets of the town, with men crying out before him, So let
it be done to the man whom the king has delight in honouring.

<span id="an_6:10">6:10</span> Then the king said to Haman, Go quickly,
and take the robes and the horse, as you have said, and do even so to
Mordecai the Jew, who is seated at the king's doorway: see that you do
everything as you have said.

<span id="an_6:11">6:11</span> Then Haman took the robes and the horse,
and dressing Mordecai in the robes, he made him go on horseback through
the streets of the town, crying out before him, So let it be done to the
man whom the king has delight in honouring.

<span id="an_6:12">6:12</span> And Mordecai came back to the king's
doorway. But Haman went quickly back to his house, sad and with his head
covered.

<span id="an_6:13">6:13</span> And Haman gave his wife Zeresh and all
his friends an account of what had taken place. Then his wise men and
his wife Zeresh said to him, If Mordecai, who is starting to get the
better of you, is of the seed of the Jews, you will not be able to do
anything against him, but you will certainly go down before him.

<span id="an_6:14">6:14</span> While they were still talking, the king's
servants came to take Haman to the feast which Esther had made ready.

<span id="an_7:1">7:1</span> So the king and Haman came to take wine
with Esther the queen.

<span id="an_7:2">7:2</span> And the king said to Esther again on the
second day, while they were drinking, What is your prayer, Queen Esther?
for it will be given to you; and what is your request? for it will be
done, even to the half of my kingdom.

<span id="an_7:3">7:3</span> Then Esther the queen, answering, said, If
I have your approval, O king, and if it is the king's pleasure, let my
life be given to me in answer to my prayer, and my people at my request:

<span id="an_7:4">7:4</span> For we are given up, I and my people, to
destruction and death and to be cut off. If we had been taken as
men-servants and women-servants for a price, I would have said nothing,
for our trouble is little in comparison with the king's loss.

<span id="an_7:5">7:5</span> Then King Ahasuerus said to Esther the
queen, Who is he and where is he who has had this evil thought in his
heart?

<span id="an_7:6">7:6</span> And Esther said, Our hater and attacker is
this evil Haman. Then Haman was full of fear before the king and the
queen.

<span id="an_7:7">7:7</span> And the king in his wrath got up from the
feast and went into the garden: and Haman got to his feet to make a
prayer for his life to Esther the queen: for he saw that the king's
purpose was evil against him.

<span id="an_7:8">7:8</span> Then the king came back from the garden
into the room where they had been drinking; and Haman was stretched out
on the seat where Esther was. Then the king said, Is he taking the queen
by force before my eyes in my house? And while the words were on the
king's lips, they put a cloth over Haman's face.

<span id="an_7:9">7:9</span> Then Harbonah, one of the unsexed servants
waiting before the king, said, See, the pillar fifty cubits high, which
Haman made for Mordecai, who said a good word for the king, is still in
its place in Haman's house. Then the king said, Put him to death by
hanging him on it.

<span id="an_7:10">7:10</span> So Haman was put to death by hanging him
on the pillar he had made for Mordecai. Then the king's wrath became
less.

<span id="an_8:1">8:1</span> That day the king gave all the family of
Haman, the hater of the Jews, to Esther the queen. And Mordecai came
before the king, for Esther had made clear what he was to her.

<span id="an_8:2">8:2</span> And the king took off his ring, which he
had taken from Haman, and gave it to Mordecai. And Esther put Mordecai
over the family of Haman.

<span id="an_8:3">8:3</span> Then Esther again came before the king,
falling down at his feet, and made request to him with weeping, that he
would put a stop to the evil purposes of Haman the Agagite and the
designs which he had made against the Jews.

<span id="an_8:4">8:4</span> Then the king put out the rod of gold to
Esther, and she got up before the king.

<span id="an_8:5">8:5</span> And she said, If it is the king's pleasure
and if I have his approval and this thing seems right to the king and I
am pleasing to him, then let letters be sent giving orders against those
which Haman, the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, sent out for the
destruction of the Jews in all divisions of the kingdom:

<span id="an_8:6">8:6</span> For how is it possible for me to see the
evil which is to overtake my nation? how may I see the destruction of my
people?

<span id="an_8:7">8:7</span> Then King Ahasuerus said to Esther the
queen and to Mordecai the Jew, See now, I have given Esther the family
of Haman, and he has come to his death by hanging, because he made an
attack on the Jews.

<span id="an_8:8">8:8</span> So now send a letter about the Jews,
writing whatever seems good to you, in the king's name, and stamping it
with the king's ring: for a writing signed in the king's name and
stamped with the king's ring may not be changed.

<span id="an_8:9">8:9</span> Then at that time, on the twenty-third day
of the third month, which is the month Sivan, the king's scribes were
sent for; and everything ordered by Mordecai was put in writing and sent
to the Jews and the captains and the rulers and the chiefs of all the
divisions of the kingdom from India to Ethiopia, a hundred and
twenty-seven divisions, to every division in the writing commonly used
there, and to every people in their language, and to the Jews in their
writing and their language.

<span id="an_8:10">8:10</span> The letters were sent in the name of King
Ahasuerus and stamped with his ring, and they were taken by men on
horseback, going on the quick-running horses used for the king's
business, the offspring of his best horses:

<span id="an_8:11">8:11</span> In these letters the king gave authority
to the Jews in every town to come together and make a fight for their
lives, and to send death and destruction on the power of any people in
any part of the kingdom attacking them or their children or their women,
and to take their goods from them by force,

<span id="an_8:12">8:12</span> On one day in every division of the
kingdom of Ahasuerus, that is, on the thirteenth day of the twelfth
month, the month Adar.

<span id="an_8:13">8:13</span> A copy of the writing, to be made public
as an order in every division of the kingdom, was given out to all the
peoples, so that the Jews might be ready when that day came to give
punishment to their haters.

<span id="an_8:14">8:14</span> So the men went out on the quick-running
horses used on the king's business, wasting no time and forced on by the
king's order; and the order was given out in Shushan, the king's town.

<span id="an_8:15">8:15</span> And Mordecai went out from before the
king, dressed in king-like robes of blue and white, and with a great
crown of gold and clothing of purple and the best linen: and all the
town of Shushan gave loud cries of joy.

<span id="an_8:16">8:16</span> And the Jews had light and joy and
honour.

<span id="an_8:17">8:17</span> And in every part of the kingdom and in
every town, wherever the king's letter and his order came, the Jews were
glad with great joy, and had a feast and a good day. And a great number
of the people of the land became Jews: for the fear of the Jews had come
on them.

<span id="an_9:1">9:1</span> Now on the thirteenth day of the twelfth
month, which is the month Adar, when the time came for the king's order
to be put into effect, on the very day when the haters of the Jews had
been hoping to have rule over them; though the opposite had come about,
and the Jews had rule over their haters;

<span id="an_9:2">9:2</span> On that day, the Jews came together in
their towns through all the divisions of the kingdom of Ahasuerus, for
the purpose of attacking all those who were attempting evil against
them: and everyone had to give way before them, for the fear of them had
come on all the peoples.

<span id="an_9:3">9:3</span> And all the chiefs and the captains and the
rulers and those who did the king's business gave support to the Jews;
because the fear of Mordecai had come on them.

<span id="an_9:4">9:4</span> For Mordecai was great in the king's house,
and word of him went out through every part of the kingdom: for the man
Mordecai became greater and greater.

<span id="an_9:5">9:5</span> So the Jews overcame all their attackers
with the sword and with death and destruction, and did to their haters
whatever they had a desire to do.

<span id="an_9:6">9:6</span> And in Shushan the Jews put to death five
hundred men.

<span id="an_9:7">9:7</span> They put to death Parshandatha, Dalphon,
Aspatha,

<span id="an_9:8">9:8</span> Poratha, Adalia, Aridatha,

<span id="an_9:9">9:9</span> Parmashta, Arisai, Aridai, and Vaizatha,

<span id="an_9:10">9:10</span> The ten sons of Haman the son of
Hammedatha, the hater of the Jews; but they put not a hand on any of
their goods.

<span id="an_9:11">9:11</span> On that day the number of those who had
been put to death in the town of Shushan was given to the king.

<span id="an_9:12">9:12</span> And the king said to Esther the queen,
The Jews have put five hundred men to death in Shushan, as well as the
ten sons of Haman: what then have they done in the rest of the kingdom!
Now what is your prayer? for it will be given to you; what other request
have you? and it will be done.

<span id="an_9:13">9:13</span> Then Esther said, If it is the king's
pleasure, let authority be given to the Jews in Shushan to do tomorrow
as has been done today, and let orders be given for the hanging of
Haman's ten sons.

<span id="an_9:14">9:14</span> And the king said that this was to be
done, and the order was given out in Shushan, and the hanging of Haman's
ten sons was effected.

<span id="an_9:15">9:15</span> For the Jews who were in Shushan came
together again on the fourteenth day of the month Adar and put to death
three hundred men in Shushan; but they put not a hand on their goods.

<span id="an_9:16">9:16</span> And the other Jews in every division of
the kingdom came together, fighting for their lives, and got salvation
from their haters and put seventy-five thousand of them to death; but
they did not put a hand on their goods.

<span id="an_9:17">9:17</span> This they did on the thirteenth day of
the month Adar; and on the fourteenth day of the same month they took
their rest, and made it a day of feasting and joy.

<span id="an_9:18">9:18</span> But the Jews in Shushan came together on
the thirteenth and on the fourteenth day of the month; and on the
fifteenth day they took their rest, and made it a day of feasting and
joy.

<span id="an_9:19">9:19</span> So the Jews of the country places living
in unwalled towns make the fourteenth day of the month Adar a day of
feasting and joy and a good day, a day for sending offerings one to
another.

<span id="an_9:20">9:20</span> And Mordecai sent letters to all the Jews
in every division of the kingdom of Ahasuerus, near and far,

<span id="an_9:21">9:21</span> Ordering them to keep the fourteenth day
of the month Adar and the fifteenth day of the same month, every year,

<span id="an_9:22">9:22</span> As days on which the Jews had rest from
their haters, and the month which for them was turned from sorrow to
joy, and from weeping to a good day: and that they were to keep them as
days of feasting and joy, of sending offerings to one another and good
things to the poor.

<span id="an_9:23">9:23</span> And the Jews gave their word to go on as
they had been doing and as Mordecai had given them orders in writing;

<span id="an_9:24">9:24</span> Because Haman, the son of Hammedatha the
Agagite, the hater of all the Jews, had made designs for their
destruction, attempting to get a decision by Pur (that is, chance) with
a view to putting an end to them and cutting them off;

<span id="an_9:25">9:25</span> But when the business was put before the
king, he gave orders by letters that the evil design which he had made
against the Jews was to be turned against himself; and that he and his
sons were to be put to death by hanging.

<span id="an_9:26">9:26</span> So these days were named Purim, after the
name of Pur. And so, because of the words of this letter, and of what
they had seen in connection with this business, and what had come to
them,

<span id="an_9:27">9:27</span> The Jews made a rule and gave an
undertaking, causing their seed and all those who were joined to them to
do the same, so that it might be in force for ever, that they would keep
those two days, as ordered in the letter, at the fixed time every year;

<span id="an_9:28">9:28</span> And that those days were to be kept in
memory through every generation and every family, in every division of
the kingdom and every town, that there might never be a time when these
days of Purim would not be kept among the Jews, or when the memory of
them would go from the minds of their seed.

<span id="an_9:29">9:29</span> Then Esther the queen, daughter of
Abihail, and Mordecai the Jew, sent a second letter giving the force of
their authority to the order about the Purim.

<span id="an_9:30">9:30</span> And he sent letters to all the Jews in
the hundred and twenty-seven divisions of the kingdom of Ahasuerus, with
true words of peace,

<span id="an_9:31">9:31</span> Giving the force of law to these days of
Purim at their fixed times, as they had been ordered by Mordecai the Jew
and Esther the queen, and in keeping with the rules they had made for
themselves and their seed, in connection with their time of going
without food and their cry for help.

<span id="an_9:32">9:32</span> The order given by Esther gave the force
of law to the rules about the Purim; and it was recorded in the book.

<span id="an_10:1">10:1</span> And King Ahasuerus put a tax on the land
and on the islands of the sea.

<span id="an_10:2">10:2</span> And all his acts of power and his great
strength and the full story of the high place which the king gave
Mordecai, are they not recorded in the book of the history of the kings
of Media and Persia?

<span id="an_10:3">10:3</span> For Mordecai the Jew was second only to
King Ahasuerus, and great among the Jews and respected by the body of
his countrymen; working for the good of his people, and saying words of
peace to all his seed.
