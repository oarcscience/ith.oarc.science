### Basic English Bible: Nehemiah

<span id="an_1:1">1:1</span> The history of Nehemiah, the son of
Hacaliah. Now it came about, in the month Chislev, in the twentieth
year, when I was in Shushan, the king's town,

<span id="an_1:2">1:2</span> That Hanani, one of my brothers, came with
certain men from Judah; and in answer to my request for news of the Jews
who had been prisoners and had got away, and of Jerusalem,

<span id="an_1:3">1:3</span> They said to me, The small band of Jews now
living there in the land are in great trouble and shame: the wall of
Jerusalem has been broken down, and its doorways burned with fire.

<span id="an_1:4">1:4</span> Then, after hearing these words, for some
days I gave myself up to weeping and sorrow, seated on the earth; and
taking no food I made prayer to the God of heaven,

<span id="an_1:5">1:5</span> And said, O Lord, the God of heaven, the
great God, greatly to be feared, keeping faith and mercy with those who
have love for him and are true to his laws:

<span id="an_1:6">1:6</span> Let your ear now take note and let your
eyes be open, so that you may give ear to the prayer of your servant,
which I make before you at this time, day and night, for the children of
Israel, your servants, while I put before you the sins of the children
of Israel, which we have done against you: truly, I and my father's
people are sinners.

<span id="an_1:7">1:7</span> We have done great wrong against you, and
have not kept the orders, the rules, and the decisions, which you gave
to your servant Moses.

<span id="an_1:8">1:8</span> Keep in mind, O Lord, the order you gave
your servant Moses, saying, If you do wrong I will send you wandering
among the peoples:

<span id="an_1:9">1:9</span> But if you come back to me and keep my
orders and do them, even if those of you who have been forced out are
living in the farthest parts of heaven, I will get them from there, and
take them back to the place marked out by me for the resting-place of my
name.

<span id="an_1:10">1:10</span> Now these are your servants and your
people, whom you have made yours by your great power and by your strong
hand.

<span id="an_1:11">1:11</span> O Lord, let your ear take note of the
prayer of your servant, and of the prayers of your servants, who take
delight in worshipping your name: give help, O Lord, to your servant
this day, and let him have mercy in the eyes of this man. (Now I was the
king's wine-servant.)

<span id="an_2:1">2:1</span> And it came about in the month Nisan, in
the twentieth year of Artaxerxes the king, when wine was before him,
that I took up the wine and gave it to the king. Now I had never before
been sad when the king was present.

<span id="an_2:2">2:2</span> And the king said to me, Why is your face
sad, seeing that you are not ill? this is nothing but sorrow of heart.
Then I was full of fear;

<span id="an_2:3">2:3</span> And said to the king, May the king be
living for ever: is it not natural for my face to be sad, when the town,
the place where the bodies of my fathers are at rest, has been made
waste and its doorways burned with fire?

<span id="an_2:4">2:4</span> Then the king said to me, What is your
desire? So I made prayer to the God of heaven.

<span id="an_2:5">2:5</span> And I said to the king, If it is the king's
pleasure, and if your servant has your approval, send me to Judah, to
the town where the bodies of my fathers are at rest, so that I may take
in hand the building of it.

<span id="an_2:6">2:6</span> And the king said to me (the queen being
seated by his side), How long will your journey take, and when will you
come back? So the king was pleased to send me, and I gave him a fixed
time.

<span id="an_2:7">2:7</span> Further, I said to the king, If it is the
king's pleasure, let letters be given to me for the rulers across the
river, so that they may let me go through till I come to Judah;

<span id="an_2:8">2:8</span> And a letter to Asaph, the keeper of the
king's park, so that he may give me wood to make boards for the doors of
the tower of the house, and for the wall of the town, and for the house
which is to be mine. And the king gave me this, for the hand of my God
was on me.

<span id="an_2:9">2:9</span> Then I came to the rulers of the lands
across the river and gave them the king's letters. Now the king had sent
with me captains of the army and horsemen.

<span id="an_2:10">2:10</span> And Sanballat the Horonite and Tobiah the
servant, the Ammonite, hearing of it, were greatly troubled because a
man had come to the help of the children of Israel.

<span id="an_2:11">2:11</span> So I came to Jerusalem and was there
three days.

<span id="an_2:12">2:12</span> And in the night I got up, taking with me
a small band of men; I said nothing to any man of what God had put into
my heart to do for Jerusalem: and I had no beast with me but the one on
which I was seated.

<span id="an_2:13">2:13</span> And I went out by night, through the
doorway of the valley, and past the dragon's water-spring as far as the
place where waste material was put, viewing the walls of Jerusalem which
were broken down, and the doorways which had been burned with fire.

<span id="an_2:14">2:14</span> Then I went on to the door of the
fountain and to the king's pool: but there was no room for my beast to
get through.

<span id="an_2:15">2:15</span> Then in the night, I went up by the
stream, viewing the wall; then turning back, I went in by the door in
the valley, and so came back.

<span id="an_2:16">2:16</span> And the chiefs had no knowledge of where
I had been or what I was doing; and I had not then said anything to the
Jews or to the priests or the great ones or the chiefs or the rest of
those who were doing the work.

<span id="an_2:17">2:17</span> Then I said to them, You see what a bad
condition we are in; how Jerusalem is a waste, and its doorways burned
with fire: come, let us get to work, building up the wall of Jerusalem,
so that we may no longer be put to shame.

<span id="an_2:18">2:18</span> Then I gave them an account of how the
hand of my God was on me, helping me; and of the king's words which he
had said to me. And they said, Let us get to work on the building. So
they made their hands strong for the good work.

<span id="an_2:19">2:19</span> But Sanballat the Horonite and Tobiah the
servant, the Ammonite, and Geshem the Arabian, hearing of it, made sport
of us, laughing at us and saying, What are you doing? will you go
against the king?

<span id="an_2:20">2:20</span> Then answering them I said, The God of
heaven, he will be our help; so we his servants will go on with our
building: but you have no part or right or any name in Jerusalem.

<span id="an_3:1">3:1</span> Then Eliashib, the chief priest, got up
with his brothers the priests, and took in hand the building of the
sheep doorway; they made it holy and put its doors in position; as far
as the tower of Hammeah they made it holy, even to the tower of Hananel.

<span id="an_3:2">3:2</span> And by his side the men of Jericho were
building. And after them, Zaccur, the son of Imri.

<span id="an_3:3">3:3</span> The sons of Hassenaah were the builders of
the fish doorway; they put its boards in place and put up its doors,
with their locks and rods.

<span id="an_3:4">3:4</span> By their side Meremoth, the son of Uriah,
the son of Hakkoz, was making good the walls. Then Meshullam, the son of
Berechiah, the son of Meshezabel; and by him, Zadok, the son of Baana.

<span id="an_3:5">3:5</span> Near them, the Tekoites were at work; but
their chiefs did not put their necks to the work of their Lord.

<span id="an_3:6">3:6</span> Joiada, the son of Paseah, and Meshullam,
the son of Besodeiah, made good the old doorway; they put its boards in
place and put up its doors, with their locks and rods.

<span id="an_3:7">3:7</span> By their side were working Melatiah the
Gibeonite and Jadon the Meronothite, the men of Gibeon and of Mizpah
from the seat of the ruler across the river.

<span id="an_3:8">3:8</span> Near them was working Uzziel, the son of
Harhaiah, the gold-worker. And by him was Hananiah, one of the
perfume-makers, building up Jerusalem as far as the wide wall.

<span id="an_3:9">3:9</span> Near them was working Rephaiah, the son of
Hur, the ruler of half Jerusalem.

<span id="an_3:10">3:10</span> By his side was Jedaiah, the son of
Harumaph, opposite his house. And by him was Hattush, the son of
Hashabneiah.

<span id="an_3:11">3:11</span> Malchijah, the son of Harim, and Hasshub,
the son of Pahath-moab, were working on another part, and the tower of
the ovens.

<span id="an_3:12">3:12</span> Near them was Shallum, the son of
Hallohesh, the ruler of half Jerusalem, with his daughters.

<span id="an_3:13">3:13</span> Hanun and the people of Zanoah were
working on the doorway of the valley; they put it up and put up its
doors, with their locks and rods, and a thousand cubits of wall as far
as the doorway where the waste material was placed.

<span id="an_3:14">3:14</span> And Malchijah, the son of Rechab, the
ruler of the division of Beth-haccherem, made good the doorway of the
waste, building it up and putting up its doors, with their locks and
rods.

<span id="an_3:15">3:15</span> And Shallun, the son of Col-hozeh, the
ruler of the division of Mizpah, made good the doorway of the fountain,
building it up and covering it and putting up its doors, with their
locks and rods, with the wall of the pool of Shelah by the king's
garden, as far as the steps which go down from the town of David.

<span id="an_3:16">3:16</span> By his side was working Nehemiah, the son
of Azbuk, ruler of half the division of Beth-zur, as far as the place
opposite the last resting-places of David's family, and the pool which
was made and the house of the men of war.

<span id="an_3:17">3:17</span> Then came the Levites, Rehum, the son of
Bani. By his side was working Hashabiah, ruler of half the division of
Keilah, for his division.

<span id="an_3:18">3:18</span> After him were working their brothers,
Bavvai, the son of Henadad, ruler of half the division of Keilah.

<span id="an_3:19">3:19</span> And by his side was working Ezer, the son
of Jeshua, the ruler of Mizpah, making good another part opposite the
way up to the store of arms at the turning of the wall.

<span id="an_3:20">3:20</span> After him Baruch, the son of Zabbai, was
hard at work on another part, from the turning of the wall to the door
of the house of Eliashib, the chief priest.

<span id="an_3:21">3:21</span> After him Meremoth, the son of Uriah, the
son of Hakkoz, was working on another part, from the door of the house
of Eliashib as far as the end of his house.

<span id="an_3:22">3:22</span> After him were working the priests, the
men of the lowland.

<span id="an_3:23">3:23</span> After them came Benjamin and Hasshub,
opposite their house. After them Azariah, the son of Maaseiah, the son
of Ananiah, made good the wall by the house where he himself was living.

<span id="an_3:24">3:24</span> After him Binnui, the son of Henadad, was
working on another part, from the house of Azariah as far as the turning
of the wall and the angle.

<span id="an_3:25">3:25</span> Palal, the son of Uzai, made good the
wall opposite the angle and the tower which comes out from the higher
part of the king's house, by the open space of the watch. After him was
Pedaiah, the son of Parosh.

<span id="an_3:26">3:26</span> (Now the Nethinim were living in the
Ophel, as far as the place facing the water doorway to the east, and the
tower which comes out.)

<span id="an_3:27">3:27</span> After him the Tekoites were making good
another part, opposite the great tower which comes out, and up to the
wall of the Ophel.

<span id="an_3:28">3:28</span> Further on, past the horse doorway, the
priests were at work, every one opposite his house.

<span id="an_3:29">3:29</span> After them Zadok, the son of Immer, was
working opposite his house. And after him Shemaiah, the son of
Shecaniah, the keeper of the east door.

<span id="an_3:30">3:30</span> After him Hananiah, the son of Shelemiah,
and Hanun, the sixth son of Zalaph, were making good another part. After
him Meshullam, the son of Berechiah, made good the wall opposite his
room.

<span id="an_3:31">3:31</span> After him Malchijah, one of the
gold-workers to the Nethinim and the traders, made good the wall
opposite the doorway of Hammiphkad and as far as the way up to the
angle.

<span id="an_3:32">3:32</span> And between the way up to the angle and
the sheep door, the gold-workers and the traders made good the wall.

<span id="an_4:1">4:1</span> Now, Sanballat, hearing that we were
building the wall, was very angry, and in his wrath made sport of the
Jews.

<span id="an_4:2">4:2</span> And in the hearing of his countrymen and
the army of Samaria he said, What are these feeble Jews doing? will they
make themselves strong? will they make offerings? will they get the work
done in a day? will they make the stones which have been burned come
again out of the dust?

<span id="an_4:3">4:3</span> Now Tobiah the Ammonite was by him, and he
said, Such is their building that if a fox goes up it, their stone wall
will be broken down.

<span id="an_4:4">4:4</span> Give ear, O our God, for we are looked down
on: let their words of shame be turned back on themselves, and let them
be given up to wasting in a land where they are prisoners:

<span id="an_4:5">4:5</span> Let not their wrongdoing be covered or
their sin washed away from before you: for they have made you angry
before the builders.

<span id="an_4:6">4:6</span> So we went on building the wall; and all
the wall was joined together half-way up: for the people were working
hard.

<span id="an_4:7">4:7</span> But when it came to the ears of Sanballat
and Tobiah and the Arabians and the Ammonites and the Ashdodites, that
the building of the walls of Jerusalem was going forward and the broken
places were being made good, they were full of wrath;

<span id="an_4:8">4:8</span> And they made designs, all of them
together, to come and make an attack on Jerusalem, causing trouble
there.

<span id="an_4:9">4:9</span> But we made our prayer to God, and had men
on watch against them day and night because of them.

<span id="an_4:10">4:10</span> And Judah said, The strength of the
workmen is giving way, and there is much waste material; it is
impossible for us to put up the wall.

<span id="an_4:11">4:11</span> And those who were against us said,
Without their knowledge and without their seeing us, we will come among
them and put them to death, causing the work to come to a stop.

<span id="an_4:12">4:12</span> And it came about that when the Jews who
were living near them came, they said to us ten times, From all
directions they are coming against us.

<span id="an_4:13">4:13</span> So in the lowest part of the space at the
back of the walls, in the open places, I put the people by families,
with their swords, their spears, and their bows.

<span id="an_4:14">4:14</span> And after looking, I got up and said to
the great ones and to the chiefs and to the rest of the people, Have no
fear of them: keep in mind the Lord who is great and greatly to be
feared, and take up arms for your brothers, your sons, and your
daughters, your wives and your houses.

<span id="an_4:15">4:15</span> And when it came to the ears of those who
were against us, that we had knowledge of their designs and that God had
made their purpose come to nothing, we all went back to the wall,
everyone to his work

<span id="an_4:16">4:16</span> And from that time, half of my servants
were doing their part of the work, and half kept the spears and
body-covers and the bows and the metal war-dresses; and the chiefs were
at the back of the men of Judah.

<span id="an_4:17">4:17</span> Those who were building the wall and
those who were moving material did their part, everyone working with one
hand, with his spear in the other;

<span id="an_4:18">4:18</span> Every builder was working with his sword
at his side. And by my side was a man for sounding the horn.

<span id="an_4:19">4:19</span> And I said to the great ones and the
chiefs and the rest of the people, The work is great and widely spaced
and we are far away from one another on the wall:

<span id="an_4:20">4:20</span> Wherever you may be when the horn is
sounded, come here to us; our God will be fighting for us.

<span id="an_4:21">4:21</span> So we went on with the work: and half of
them had spears in their hands from the dawn of the morning till the
stars were seen.

<span id="an_4:22">4:22</span> And at the same time I said to the
people, Let everyone with his servant come inside Jerusalem for the
night, so that at night they may keep watch for us, and go on working by
day.

<span id="an_4:23">4:23</span> So not one of us, I or my brothers or my
servants or the watchmen who were with me, took off his clothing,
everyone went armed to the water.

<span id="an_5:1">5:1</span> Then there was a great outcry from the
people and their wives against their countrymen the Jews.

<span id="an_5:2">5:2</span> For there were some who said, We, our sons
and our daughters, are a great number: let us get grain, so that we may
have food for our needs.

<span id="an_5:3">5:3</span> And there were some who said, We are giving
our fields and our vine-gardens and our houses for debt: let us get
grain because we are in need.

<span id="an_5:4">5:4</span> And there were others who said, We have
given up our fields and our vine-gardens to get money for the king's
taxes.

<span id="an_5:5">5:5</span> But our flesh is the same as the flesh of
our countrymen, and our children as their children: and now we are
giving our sons and daughters into the hands of others, to be their
servants, and some of our daughters are servants even now: and we have
no power to put a stop to it; for other men have our fields and our
vine-gardens.

<span id="an_5:6">5:6</span> And on hearing their outcry and what they
said I was very angry.

<span id="an_5:7">5:7</span> And after turning it over in my mind, I
made a protest to the chiefs and the rulers, and said to them, Every one
of you is taking interest from his countryman. And I got together a
great meeting of protest.

<span id="an_5:8">5:8</span> And I said to them, We have given whatever
we were able to give, to make our brothers the Jews free, who were
servants and prisoners of the nations: and would you now give up your
brothers for a price, and are they to become our property? Then they
said nothing, answering not a word.

<span id="an_5:9">5:9</span> And I said, What you are doing is not good:
is it not the more necessary for you to go in the fear of our God,
because of the shame which the nations may put on us?

<span id="an_5:10">5:10</span> Even I and my servants have been taking
interest for the money and the grain we have let them have. So now, let
us give up this thing.

<span id="an_5:11">5:11</span> Give back to them this very day their
fields, their vine-gardens, their olive-gardens, and their houses, as
well as a hundredth part of the money and the grain and the wine and the
oil which you have taken from them.

<span id="an_5:12">5:12</span> Then they said, We will give them back,
and take nothing for them; we will do as you say. Then I sent for the
priests and made them take an oath that they would keep this agreement.

<span id="an_5:13">5:13</span> And shaking out the folds of my robe, I
said, So may God send out from his house and his work every man who does
not keep this agreement; even so let him be sent out and made as
nothing. And all the meeting of the people said, So be it, and gave
praise to the Lord. And the people did as they had said.

<span id="an_5:14">5:14</span> Now from the time when I was made ruler
of the people in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year till the
thirty-second year of Artaxerxes the king, for twelve years, I and my
servants have never taken the food which was the right of the ruler.

<span id="an_5:15">5:15</span> But earlier rulers who were before me
made the people responsible for their upkeep, and took from them bread
and wine at the rate of forty shekels of silver; and even their servants
were lords over the people: but I did not do so, because of the fear of
God.

<span id="an_5:16">5:16</span> And I kept on with the work of this wall,
and we got no land for ourselves: and all my servants were helping with
the work.

<span id="an_5:17">5:17</span> And more than this, a hundred and fifty
of the Jews and the rulers were guests at my table, in addition to those
who came to us from the nations round about us.

<span id="an_5:18">5:18</span> Now the food made ready for one day was
one ox and six fat sheep, as well as fowls; and once in ten days a store
of all sorts of wine: but all the same, I did not take the food to which
the ruler had a right, because the people were crushed under a hard
yoke.

<span id="an_5:19">5:19</span> Keep in mind, O my God, for my good, all
I have done for this people.

<span id="an_6:1">6:1</span> Now when word was given to Sanballat and
Tobiah and to Geshem the Arabian and to the rest of our haters, that I
had done the building of the wall and that there were no more broken
places in it (though even then I had not put up the doors in the
doorways);

<span id="an_6:2">6:2</span> Sanballat and Geshem sent to me saying,
Come, let us have a meeting in one of the little towns in the lowland of
Ono. But their purpose was to do me evil.

<span id="an_6:3">6:3</span> And I sent men to them saying, I am doing a
great work, so that it is not possible for me to come down: is the work
to be stopped while I go away from it and come down to you?

<span id="an_6:4">6:4</span> And four times they sent to me in this way,
and I sent them the same answer.

<span id="an_6:5">6:5</span> Then Sanballat sent his servant to me a
fifth time with an open letter in his hand;

<span id="an_6:6">6:6</span> And in it these words were recorded: It is
said among the nations, and Geshem says so, that you and the Jews are
hoping to make yourselves free from the king's authority; and that this
is why you are building the wall: and they say that it is your purpose
to be their king;

<span id="an_6:7">6:7</span> And that you have prophets preaching about
you in Jerusalem, and saying, There is a king in Judah: now an account
of these things will be sent to the king. So come now, and let us have a
discussion.

<span id="an_6:8">6:8</span> Then I sent to him, saying, No such things
as you say are being done, they are only a fiction you have made up
yourself.

<span id="an_6:9">6:9</span> For they were hoping to put fear in us,
saying, Their hands will become feeble and give up the work so that it
may not get done. But now, O God, make my hands strong.

<span id="an_6:10">6:10</span> And I went to the house of Shemaiah, the
son of Delaiah, the son of Mehetabel, who was shut up; and he said, Let
us have a meeting in the house of God, inside the Temple, and let the
doors be shut: for they will come to put you to death; truly, in the
night they will come to put you to death.

<span id="an_6:11">6:11</span> And I said, Am I the sort of man to go in
flight? what man, in my position, would go into the Temple to keep
himself safe? I will not go in.

<span id="an_6:12">6:12</span> Then it became clear to me that God had
not sent him: he had given this word of a prophet against me himself:
and Tobiah and Sanballat had given him money to do so.

<span id="an_6:13">6:13</span> For this reason they had given him money,
in order that I might be overcome by fear and do what he said and do
wrong, and so they would have reason to say evil about me and put shame
on me.

<span id="an_6:14">6:14</span> Keep in mind, O my God, Tobiah and
Sanballat and what they did, and Noadiah, the woman prophet, and the
rest of the prophets whose purpose was to put fear into me.

<span id="an_6:15">6:15</span> So the wall was complete on the
twenty-fifth day of the month Elul, in fifty-two days.

<span id="an_6:16">6:16</span> And when our haters had news of this, all
the nations round about us were full of fear and were greatly shamed,
for they saw that this work had been done by our God.

<span id="an_6:17">6:17</span> And further, in those days the chiefs of
Judah sent a number of letters to Tobiah, and his letters came to them.

<span id="an_6:18">6:18</span> For in Judah there were a number of
people who had made an agreement by oath with him, because he was the
son-in-law of Shecaniah, the son of Arah; and his son Jehohanan had
taken as his wife the daughter of Meshullam, the son of Berechiah.

<span id="an_6:19">6:19</span> And they said much before me of the good
he had done, and gave him accounts of my words. And Tobiah sent letters
with the purpose of causing me fear.

<span id="an_7:1">7:1</span> Now when the building of the wall was
complete and I had put up the doors, and the door-keepers and the
music-makers and the Levites had been given their places,

<span id="an_7:2">7:2</span> I made my brother Hanani, and Hananiah, the
ruler of the tower, responsible for the government of Jerusalem: for he
was a man of good faith, fearing God more than most.

<span id="an_7:3">7:3</span> And I said to them, Do not let the doors of
Jerusalem be open till the sun is high; and while the watchmen are in
their places, let the doors be shut and locked: and let the people of
Jerusalem be put on watch, every one in his watch, opposite his house.

<span id="an_7:4">7:4</span> Now the town was wide and great: but the
people in it were only a small number, and the houses had not been put
up.

<span id="an_7:5">7:5</span> And my God put it into my heart to get
together the rulers and the chiefs and the people so that they might be
listed by families. And I came across a record of the names of those who
came up at the first, and in it I saw these words:

<span id="an_7:6">7:6</span> These are the people of the divisions of
the kingdom, among those who had been made prisoners by Nebuchadnezzar,
the king of Babylon, and taken away by him, who went back to Jerusalem
and Judah, every one to his town;

<span id="an_7:7">7:7</span> Who came with Zerubbabel, Jeshua, Nehemiah,
Azariah, Raamiah, Nahamani, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mispereth, Bigvai, Nehum,
Baanah. The number of the men of the people of Israel:

<span id="an_7:54">7:54</span> The children of Bazlith, the children of
Mehida, the children of Harsha,

<span id="an_7:55">7:55</span> The children of Barkos, the children of
Sisera, the children of Temah,

<span id="an_7:56">7:56</span> The children of Neziah, the children of

<span id="an_7:57">7:57</span> The children of Solomon's servants: the
children of Sotai, the children of Sophereth, the children of Perida,

<span id="an_7:58">7:58</span> The children of Jaala, the children of
Darkon, the children of Giddel,

<span id="an_7:59">7:59</span> The children of Shephatiah, the children
of Hattil, the children of Pochereth-hazzebaim, the children of Amon.

<span id="an_7:60">7:60</span> All the Nethinim and the children of
Solomon's servants were three hundred and ninety-two.

<span id="an_7:61">7:61</span> All these were the people who went up
from Tel-melah, Tel-harsha, Cherub, Addon, and Immer; but because they
had no knowledge of their fathers' families or offspring, it was not
certain if they were Israelites:

<span id="an_7:62">7:62</span> The children of Delaiah, the children of
Tobiah, the children of Nekoda, six hundred and forty-two.

<span id="an_7:63">7:63</span> And of the priests: the children of
Hobaiah, the children of Hakkoz, the children of Barzillai, who was
married to one of the daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite, and took
their name.

<span id="an_7:64">7:64</span> They made search for their record among
the lists of families, but their names were nowhere to be seen, so they
were looked on as unclean and no longer priests.

<span id="an_7:65">7:65</span> And the Tirshatha said that they were not
to have the most holy things for their food, till a priest came to give
decision by the Urim and Thummim.

<span id="an_7:66">7:66</span> The number of all the people together was
forty-two thousand, three hundred and sixty;

<span id="an_7:67">7:67</span> As well as their men-servants and their
women-servants, of whom there were seven thousand, three hundred and
thirty-seven; and they had two hundred and forty-five men and women to
make music.

<span id="an_7:68">7:68</span> They had seven hundred and thirty-six
horses, two hundred and forty-five transport beasts;

<span id="an_7:69">7:69</span> Four hundred and thirty-five camels, six
thousand, seven hundred and twenty asses.

<span id="an_7:70">7:70</span> And some of the heads of families gave
money for the work. The Tirshatha gave into the store a thousand darics
of gold, fifty basins, five hundred and thirty priests' robes.

<span id="an_7:71">7:71</span> And some of the heads of families gave
into the store for the work twenty thousand darics of gold, and two
thousand, two hundred pounds of silver.

<span id="an_7:72">7:72</span> And that which the rest of the people
gave was twenty thousand darics of gold, and two thousand pounds of
silver, and sixty-seven priests' robes.

<span id="an_7:73">7:73</span> So the priests and the Levites and the
door-keepers and the music-makers and some of the people and the
Nethinim, and all Israel, were living in their towns.

<span id="an_8:1">8:1</span> And when the seventh month came, the
children of Israel were in their towns. And all the people came together
like one man into the wide place in front of the water-doorway; and they
made a request to Ezra the scribe that he would put before them the book
of the law of Moses which the Lord had given to Israel.

<span id="an_8:2">8:2</span> And Ezra the priest put the law before the
meeting of the people, before the men and women and all those who were
able to take it in, on the first day of the seventh month.

<span id="an_8:3">8:3</span> He was reading it in the wide place in
front of the water-doorway, from early morning till the middle of the
day, in the hearing of all those men and women whose minds were able to
take it in; and the ears of all the people were open to the book of the
law.

<span id="an_8:4">8:4</span> And Ezra the scribe took his place on a
tower of wood which they had made for the purpose; and by his side were
placed Mattithiah and Shema and Anaiah and Uriah and Hilkiah and
Maaseiah on the right; and on the left, Pedaiah and Mishael and
Malchijah and Hashum and Hashbaddanah, Zechariah and Meshullam.

<span id="an_8:5">8:5</span> And Ezra took the book, opening it before
the eyes of all the people (for he was higher than the people); and when
it was open, all the people got to their feet:

<span id="an_8:6">8:6</span> And Ezra gave praise to the Lord, the great
God. And all the people in answer said, So be it, so be it; lifting up
their hands; and with bent heads they gave worship to the Lord, going
down on their faces to the earth.

<span id="an_8:7">8:7</span> And Jeshua and Bani and Sherebiah and
Jamin, Akkub, Shabbethai, Hodiah, Maaseiah, Kelita, Azariah, Jozabad,
Hanan, Pelaiah, and the Levites made the law clear to the people: and
the people kept in their places.

<span id="an_8:8">8:8</span> And they gave out the words of the book the
law of God, clearly, and gave the sense of it, so that their minds were
able to take it in.

<span id="an_8:9">8:9</span> And Nehemiah, who was the Tirshatha, and
Ezra, the priest and scribe, and the Levites who were the teachers of
the people, said to all the people, This day is holy to the Lord your
God; let there be no sorrow or weeping; for all the people were weeping
on hearing the words of the law.

<span id="an_8:10">8:10</span> Then he said to them, Go away now, and
take the fat for your food and the sweet for your drink, and send some
to him for whom nothing is made ready: for this day is holy to our Lord:
and let there be no grief in your hearts; for the joy of the Lord is
your strong place.

<span id="an_8:11">8:11</span> So the Levites made all the people quiet,
saying, Be quiet, for the day is holy; and do not give way to grief.

<span id="an_8:12">8:12</span> And all the people went away to take food
and drink, and to send food to others, and to be glad, because the words
which were said to them had been made clear.

<span id="an_8:13">8:13</span> And on the second day the heads of
families of all the people and the priests and the Levites came together
to Ezra the scribe, to give attention to the words of the law.

<span id="an_8:14">8:14</span> And they saw that it was recorded in the
law that the Lord had given orders by Moses, that the children of Israel
were to have tents for their living-places in the feast of the seventh
month:

<span id="an_8:15">8:15</span> And that they were to give out an order,
and make it public in all their towns and in Jerusalem, saying, Go out
to the mountain and get olive branches and branches of field olives and
of myrtle, and palm branches and branches of thick trees, to make tents,
as it says in the book.

<span id="an_8:16">8:16</span> And the people went out and got them and
made themselves tents, every one on the roof of his house, and in the
open spaces and in the open squares of the house of God, and in the wide
place of the water-doorway, and the wide place of the doorway of
Ephraim.

<span id="an_8:17">8:17</span> All the people who had been prisoners and
had come back, made tents and were living in them: for from the time of
Jeshua, the son of Nun, till that day, the children of Israel had not
done so. And there was very great joy.

<span id="an_8:18">8:18</span> And day by day, from the first day till
the last, he was reading from the book of the law of God. And they kept
the feast for seven days: and on the eighth day there was a holy
meeting, as it is ordered in the law.

<span id="an_9:1">9:1</span> Now on the twenty-fourth day of this month
the children of Israel came together, taking no food and putting
haircloth and dust on their bodies.

<span id="an_9:2">9:2</span> And the seed of Israel made themselves
separate from all the men of other nations, publicly requesting
forgiveness for their sins and the wrongdoing of their fathers.

<span id="an_9:3">9:3</span> And for a fourth part of the day, upright
in their places, they were reading from the book of the law of their
God; and for a fourth part of the day they were requesting forgiveness
and worshipping the Lord their God.

<span id="an_9:4">9:4</span> Then Jeshua, and Bani, Kadmiel, Shebaniah,
Bunni, Sherebiah, Bani, and Chenani took their places on the steps of
the Levites, crying in a loud voice to the Lord their God.

<span id="an_9:5">9:5</span> Then the Levites, Jeshua, and Kadmiel,
Bani, Hashabneiah, Sherebiah, Hodiah, Shebaniah, and Pethahiah said, Get
up and give praise to the Lord your God for ever and ever. Praise be to
your great name which is lifted up high over all blessing and praise.

<span id="an_9:6">9:6</span> You are the Lord, even you only; you have
made heaven, the heaven of heavens with all their armies, the earth and
all things in it, the seas and everything in them; and you keep them
from destruction: and the armies of heaven are your worshippers.

<span id="an_9:7">9:7</span> You are the Lord, the God, who took Abram
and made him yours, guiding him from Ur of the Chaldees, and gave him
the name of Abraham;

<span id="an_9:8">9:8</span> You saw that his heart was true to you, and
made an agreement with him to give the land of the Canaanite, the
Hittite, the Amorite and the Perizzite and the Jebusite and the
Girgashite, even to give it to his seed, and you have done what you
said; for righteousness is yours:

<span id="an_9:9">9:9</span> And you saw the trouble of our fathers in
Egypt, and their cry came to your ears by the Red Sea;

<span id="an_9:10">9:10</span> And you did signs and wonders on Pharaoh
and all his servants and all the people of his land; for you saw how
cruel they were to them. So you got yourself a name as it is today.

<span id="an_9:11">9:11</span> By you the sea was parted before them, so
that they went through the sea on dry land; and those who went after
them went down into the deep, like a stone into great waters.

<span id="an_9:12">9:12</span> And you went before them by day in a
pillar of cloud, and in a pillar of fire by night, to give them light on
the way they were to go.

<span id="an_9:13">9:13</span> And you came down on Mount Sinai, and
your voice came to them from heaven, giving them right decisions and
true laws, good rules and orders:

<span id="an_9:14">9:14</span> And you gave them word of your holy
Sabbath, and gave them orders and rules and a law, by the hand of Moses
your servant:

<span id="an_9:15">9:15</span> And you gave them bread from heaven when
they were in need, and made water come out of the rock for their drink,
and gave them orders to go in and take for their heritage the land which
your hand had been lifted up to give them.

<span id="an_9:16">9:16</span> But they and our fathers, in their pride,
made their necks stiff, and gave no attention to your orders,

<span id="an_9:17">9:17</span> And would not do them, and gave no
thought to the wonders you had done among them; but made their necks
stiff, and turning away from you, made a captain over themselves to take
them back to their prison in Egypt: but you are a God of forgiveness,
full of grace and pity, slow to wrath and great in mercy, and you did
not give them up.

<span id="an_9:18">9:18</span> Even when they had made for themselves an
ox of metal, and said, This is your God who took you up out of Egypt,
and had done so much to make you angry;

<span id="an_9:19">9:19</span> Even then, in your great mercy, you did
not give them up in the waste land: the pillar of cloud still went
before them by day, guiding them on their way, and the pillar of fire by
night, to give them light, and make clear the way they were to go.

<span id="an_9:20">9:20</span> And you gave your good spirit to be their
teacher, and did not keep back your manna from their mouths, and gave
them water when they had need of it.

<span id="an_9:21">9:21</span> Truly, for forty years you were their
support in the waste land, and they were in need of nothing; their
clothing did not get old or their feet become tired.

<span id="an_9:22">9:22</span> And you gave them kingdoms and peoples,
making distribution to them in every part of the land: so they took for
their heritage the land of Sihon, even the land of the king of Heshbon,
and the land of Og, king of Bashan.

<span id="an_9:23">9:23</span> And you made their children as great in
number as the stars of heaven, and took them into the land, of which you
had said to their fathers that they were to go in and take it for
themselves.

<span id="an_9:24">9:24</span> So the children went in and took the
land, and you overcame before them the people of the land, the
Canaanites, and gave them up into their hands, with their kings and the
people of the land, so that they might do with them whatever it was
their pleasure to do.

<span id="an_9:25">9:25</span> And they took walled towns and a fat
land, and became the owners of houses full of all good things,
water-holes cut in the rock, vine-gardens and olive-gardens and a wealth
of fruit-trees: so they had food enough and became fat, and had joy in
the good you gave them.

<span id="an_9:26">9:26</span> But they were hard-hearted, and went
against your authority, turning their backs on your law, and putting to
death your prophets, who gave witness against them with the purpose of
turning them back again to you, and they did much to make you angry.

<span id="an_9:27">9:27</span> And so you gave them up into the hands of
their haters who were cruel to them: and in the time of their trouble,
when they made their prayer to you, you gave ear to them from heaven;
and in your great mercy gave them saviours, who made them free from the
hands of their haters.

<span id="an_9:28">9:28</span> But when they had rest, they did evil
again before you: so you gave them into the hands of their haters, who
had rule over them: but when they came back and made their prayer to
you, you gave ear to them from heaven; again and again, in your mercy,
you gave them salvation;

<span id="an_9:29">9:29</span> And gave witness against them so that you
might make them come back again to your law: but their hearts were
lifted up, and they gave no attention to your orders and went against
your decisions (which, if a man keeps them, will be life to him), and
turning their backs on you, made their necks stiff and did not give ear.

<span id="an_9:30">9:30</span> Year after year you put up with them, and
gave witness against them by your spirit through your prophets: still
they did not give ear: and so you gave them up into the hands of the
peoples of the lands.

<span id="an_9:31">9:31</span> Even then, in your great mercy, you did
not put an end to them completely, or give them up; for you are a God of
grace and mercy.

<span id="an_9:32">9:32</span> And now, our God, the great, the strong,
the God who is to be feared, who keeps faith and mercy, let not all this
trouble seem small to you, which has come on us, and on our kings and
our rulers and on our priests and our prophets and our fathers and on
all your people from the time of the kings of Assyria till this day.

<span id="an_9:33">9:33</span> But still, you have been in the right in
everything which has come on us; you have been true to us, but we have
done evil:

<span id="an_9:34">9:34</span> And our kings, our rulers, our priests,
and our fathers have not kept your law or given attention to your orders
and your witness, with which you gave witness against them.

<span id="an_9:35">9:35</span> For they have not been your servants in
their kingdom, and in all the good things you gave them, and in the
great and fat land you gave them, and they have not been turned away
from their evil-doing.

<span id="an_9:36">9:36</span> Now, today, we are servants, and as for
the land which you gave to our fathers, so that the produce of it and
the good might be theirs, see, we are servants in it:

<span id="an_9:37">9:37</span> And it gives much increase to the kings
whom you have put over us because of our sins: and they have power over
our bodies and over our cattle at their pleasure, and we are in great
trouble.

<span id="an_9:38">9:38</span> And because of all this we are making an
agreement in good faith, and putting it in writing; and our rulers, our
Levites, and our priests are putting their names to it.

<span id="an_10:1">10:1</span> Now those who put down their names were
Nehemiah the Tirshatha, the son of Hacaliah, and Zedekiah,

<span id="an_10:2">10:2</span> Seraiah, Azariah, Jeremiah,

<span id="an_10:3">10:3</span> Pashhur, Amariah, Malchijah,

<span id="an_10:4">10:4</span> Hattush, Shebaniah, Malluch,

<span id="an_10:5">10:5</span> Harim, Meremoth, Obadiah,

<span id="an_10:6">10:6</span> Daniel, Ginnethon, Baruch,

<span id="an_10:7">10:7</span> Meshullam, Abijah, Mijamin,

<span id="an_10:8">10:8</span> Maaziah, Bilgai, Shemaiah; these were the
priests.

<span id="an_10:9">10:9</span> And the Levites: by name, Jeshua, the son
of Azaniah, Binnui, of the sons of Henadad, Kadmiel,

<span id="an_10:10">10:10</span> And their brothers, Shebaniah, Hodiah,
Kelita, Pelaiah, Hanan,

<span id="an_10:11">10:11</span> Mica, Rehob, Hashabiah,

<span id="an_10:12">10:12</span> Zaccur, Sherebiah, Shebaniah,

<span id="an_10:13">10:13</span> Hodiah, Bani, Beninu.

<span id="an_10:14">10:14</span> The chiefs of the people: Parosh,
Pahath-moab, Elam, Zattu, Bani,

<span id="an_10:15">10:15</span> Bunni, Azgad, Bebai,

<span id="an_10:16">10:16</span> Adonijah, Bigvai, Adin,

<span id="an_10:17">10:17</span> Ater, Hezekiah, Azzur,

<span id="an_10:21">10:21</span> Meshezabel, Zadok, Jaddua,

<span id="an_10:22">10:22</span> Pelatiah, Hanan, Anaiah,

<span id="an_10:23">10:23</span> Hoshea, Hananiah, Hasshub,

<span id="an_10:25">10:25</span> Rehum, Hashabnah, Maaseiah,

<span id="an_10:26">10:26</span> And Ahiah, Hanan, Anan,

<span id="an_10:27">10:27</span> Malluch, Harim, Baanah.

<span id="an_10:28">10:28</span> And the rest of the people, the
priests, the Levites, the door-keepers, the music-makers, the Nethinim,
and all those who had made themselves separate from the peoples of the
lands, to keep the law of God, their wives, their sons, and their
daughters, everyone who had knowledge and wisdom;

<span id="an_10:29">10:29</span> They were united with their brothers,
their rulers, and put themselves under a curse and an oath, to keep
their steps in the way of God's law, which was given by Moses, the
servant of God, and to keep and do all the orders of the Lord, our Lord,
and his decisions and his rules;

<span id="an_10:30">10:30</span> And that we would not give our
daughters to the peoples of the lands, or take their daughters for our
sons;

<span id="an_10:31">10:31</span> And if the peoples of the lands come to
do trade in goods or food on the Sabbath day, that we would do no trade
with them on the Sabbath or on a holy day: and that in the seventh year
we would take no payment from any debtor.

<span id="an_10:32">10:32</span> And we made rules for ourselves, taxing
ourselves a third of a shekel every year for the upkeep of the house of
our God;

<span id="an_10:33">10:33</span> For the holy bread, and for the regular
meal offering and the regular burned offering on the Sabbaths and at the
new moon and the fixed feasts, and for the sin-offerings to take away
the sin of Israel, and for all the work of the house of our God.

<span id="an_10:34">10:34</span> And we, the priests and the Levites and
the people, made selection, by the decision of the Lord, of those who
were to take the wood offering into the house of God, by families at the
regular times, year by year, to be burned on the altar of the Lord our
God, as it is recorded in the law;

<span id="an_10:35">10:35</span> And to take the first-fruits of our
land, and the first-fruits of every sort of tree, year by year, into the
house of the Lord;

<span id="an_10:36">10:36</span> As well as the first of our sons and of
our cattle, as it is recorded in the law, and the first lambs of our
herds and of our flocks, which are to be taken to the house of our God,
to the priests who are servants in the house of our God:

<span id="an_10:37">10:37</span> And that we would take the first of our
rough meal, and our lifted offerings, and the fruit of every sort of
tree, and wine and oil, to the priests, to the rooms of the house of our
God; and the tenth of the produce of our land to the Levites; for they,
the Levites, take a tenth in all the towns of our ploughed land.

<span id="an_10:38">10:38</span> And the priest, the son of Aaron, is to
be with the Levites, when the Levites take the tenths: and the Levites
are to take a tenth of the tenths into the house of our God, to the
rooms, into the store-house;

<span id="an_10:39">10:39</span> For the children of Israel and the
children of Levi are to take the lifted offering of the grain and wine
and oil into the rooms where the vessels of the holy place are, together
with the priests and the door-keepers and the makers of music: and we
will not give up caring for the house of our God.

<span id="an_11:1">11:1</span> And the rulers of the people were living
in Jerusalem: the rest of the people made selection, by the decision of
chance, of one out of every ten to be living in Jerusalem, the holy
town; the other nine to go to the other towns.

<span id="an_11:2">11:2</span> And the people gave a blessing to all the
men who were freely offering to take up their places in Jerusalem.

<span id="an_11:3">11:3</span> Now these are the chiefs of the divisions
of the country who were living in Jerusalem: but in the towns of Judah
everyone was living on his heritage in the towns, that is, Israel, the
priests, the Levites, the Nethinim, and the children of Solomon's
servants.

<span id="an_11:4">11:4</span> And in Jerusalem there were living
certain of the children of Judah and of Benjamin. Of the children of
Judah: Athaiah, the son of Uzziah, the son of Zechariah, the son of
Amariah, the son of Shephatiah, the son of Mahalalel, of the children of
Perez;

<span id="an_11:5">11:5</span> And Maaseiah, the son of Baruch, the son
of Col-hozeh, the son of Hazaiah, the son of Adaiah, the son of Joiarib,
the son of Zechariah, the son of the Shilonite.

<span id="an_11:6">11:6</span> All the sons of Perez living in Jerusalem
were four hundred and sixty-eight men of good position.

<span id="an_11:7">11:7</span> And these are the sons of Benjamin:
Sallu, the son of Meshullam, the son of Joed, the son of Pedaiah, the
son of Kolaiah, the son of Maaseiah, the son of Ithiel, the son of
Jeshaiah.

<span id="an_11:8">11:8</span> And after him Gabbai, Sallai, nine
hundred and twenty-eight.

<span id="an_11:9">11:9</span> And Joel, the son of Zichri, was their
overseer; and Judah, the son of Hassenuah, was second over the town.

<span id="an_11:10">11:10</span> Of the priests: Jedaiah, the son of
Joiarib, Jachin,

<span id="an_11:11">11:11</span> Seraiah, the son of Hilkiah, the son of
Meshullam, the son of Zadok, the son of Meraioth, the son of Ahitub, the
ruler of the house of God,

<span id="an_11:12">11:12</span> And their brothers who did the work of
the house, eight hundred and twenty-two; and Adaiah, the son of Jeroham,
the son of Pelaliah, the son of Amzi, the son of Zechariah, the son of
Pashhur, the son of Malchijah,

<span id="an_11:13">11:13</span> And his brothers, heads of families,
two hundred and forty-two; and Amashsai, the son of Azarel, the son of
Ahzai, the son of Meshillemoth, the son of Immer,

<span id="an_11:14">11:14</span> And their brothers, men of war, a
hundred and twenty-eight; and their overseer was Zabdiel, the son of
Haggedolim.

<span id="an_11:15">11:15</span> And of the Levites: Shemaiah, the son
of Hasshub, the son of Azrikam, the son of Hashabiah, the son of Bunni,

<span id="an_11:16">11:16</span> And Shabbethai and Jozabad, of the
chiefs of the Levites, who were responsible for the outside business of
the house of God;

<span id="an_11:17">11:17</span> And Mattaniah, the son of Mica, the son
of Zabdi, the son of Asaph, who had to give the first note of the song
of praise in prayer, and Bakbukiah, the second among his brothers, and
Abda, the son of Shammua, the son of Galal, the son of Jeduthun.

<span id="an_11:18">11:18</span> All the Levites in the holy town were
two hundred and eighty-four.

<span id="an_11:19">11:19</span> In addition the door-keepers, Akkub,
Talmon, and their brothers who kept watch at the doors, were a hundred
and seventy-two.

<span id="an_11:20">11:20</span> And the rest of Israel, of the priests,
the Levites, were in all the towns of Judah, every one in his heritage.

<span id="an_11:21">11:21</span> But the Nethinim were living in the
Ophel; and Ziha and Gishpa were over the Nethinim.

<span id="an_11:22">11:22</span> And the overseer of the Levites at
Jerusalem was Uzzi, the son of Bani, the son of Hashabiah, the son of
Mattaniah, the son of Mica, of the sons of Asaph, the music-makers, who
was over the business of the house of God.

<span id="an_11:23">11:23</span> For there was an order from the king
about them and a regular amount for the music-makers, for their needs
day by day.

<span id="an_11:24">11:24</span> And Pethahiah, the son of Meshezabel,
of the sons of Zerah, the son of Judah, was the king's servant in
everything to do with the people.

<span id="an_11:25">11:25</span> And for the daughter-towns with their
fields, some of the men of Judah were living in Kiriath-arba and its
daughter-towns, and in Dibon and its daughter-towns, and in Jekabzeel
and its daughter-towns,

<span id="an_11:26">11:26</span> And in Jeshua, and in Moladah, and
Beth-pelet,

<span id="an_11:27">11:27</span> And in Hazar-shual, and in Beer-sheba
and its daughter-towns,

<span id="an_11:28">11:28</span> And in Ziklag, and in Meconah and its
daughter-towns,

<span id="an_11:29">11:29</span> And in En-rimmon, and in Zorah, and in
Jarmuth,

<span id="an_11:30">11:30</span> Zanoah, Adullam and their
daughter-towns, Lachish and its fields, Azekah and its daughter-towns.
So they were living from Beer-sheba to the valley of Hinnom.

<span id="an_11:31">11:31</span> And the children of Benjamin were
living from Geba, at Michmash and Aija, and at Beth-el and its
daughter-towns,

<span id="an_11:32">11:32</span> At Anathoth, Nob, Ananiah,

<span id="an_11:33">11:33</span> Hazor, Ramah, Gittaim,

<span id="an_11:34">11:34</span> Hadid, Zeboim, Neballat,

<span id="an_11:35">11:35</span> Lod and Ono, the valley of expert
workers.

<span id="an_11:36">11:36</span> And of the Levites, certain divisions
in Judah were joined to Benjamin.

<span id="an_12:1">12:1</span> Now these are the priests and the Levites
who went up with Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua: Seraiah,
Jeremiah, Ezra,

<span id="an_12:2">12:2</span> Amariah, Malluch, Hattush,

<span id="an_12:3">12:3</span> Shecaniah, Rehum, Meremoth,

<span id="an_12:4">12:4</span> Iddo, Ginnethoi, Abijah,

<span id="an_12:5">12:5</span> Mijamin, Maadiah, Bilgah,

<span id="an_12:6">12:6</span> Shemaiah, and Joiarib, Jedaiah,

<span id="an_12:7">12:7</span> Sallu, Amok, Hilkiah, Jedaiah. These were
the chiefs of the priests and of their brothers in the days of Jeshua.

<span id="an_12:8">12:8</span> And the Levites: Jeshua, Binnui, Kadmiel,
Sherebiah, Judah, and Mattaniah, who was over the music-makers, he and
his brothers.

<span id="an_12:9">12:9</span> And Bakbukiah and Unno, their brothers,
were opposite them in their watches.

<span id="an_12:10">12:10</span> And Jeshua was the father of Joiakim,
and Joiakim was the father of Eliashib, and Eliashib was the father of
Joiada,

<span id="an_12:11">12:11</span> And Joiada was the father of Jonathan,
and Jonathan was the father of Jaddua.

<span id="an_12:12">12:12</span> And in the days of Joiakim there were
priests, heads of families: of Seraiah, Meraiah; of Jeremiah, Hananiah;

<span id="an_12:13">12:13</span> Of Ezra, Meshullam; of Amariah,
Jehohanan;

<span id="an_12:14">12:14</span> Of Malluchi, Jonathan; of Shebaniah,
Joseph;

<span id="an_12:15">12:15</span> Of Harim, Adna; of Meraioth, Helkai;

<span id="an_12:16">12:16</span> Of Iddo, Zechariah; of Ginnethon,
Meshullam;

<span id="an_12:17">12:17</span> Of Abijah, Zichri; of Miniamin, of
Moadiah, Piltai;

<span id="an_12:18">12:18</span> Of Bilgah, Shammua; of Shemaiah,
Jehonathan;

<span id="an_12:19">12:19</span> And of Joiarib, Mattenai; of Jedaiah,
Uzzi;

<span id="an_12:20">12:20</span> Of Sallai, Kallai; of Amok, Eber;

<span id="an_12:21">12:21</span> Of Hilkiah, Hashabiah; of Jedaiah,
Nethanel.

<span id="an_12:22">12:22</span> The Levites in the days of Eliashib,
Joiada, and Johanan, and Jaddua, were listed as heads of families; and
the priests, when Darius the Persian was king.

<span id="an_12:23">12:23</span> The sons of Levi, heads of families,
were recorded in the book of the histories, even till the days of
Johanan, the son of Eliashib.

<span id="an_12:24">12:24</span> And the chiefs of the Levites:
Hashabiah, Sherebiah, and Jeshua, the son of Kadmiel, with their
brothers opposite them, to give blessing and praise as ordered by David,
the man of God, watch against watch.

<span id="an_12:25">12:25</span> Mattaniah, and Bakbukiah, Obadiah,
Meshullam, Talmon, Akkub, were door-keepers keeping the watch at the
store-houses of the doors.

<span id="an_12:26">12:26</span> These were in the days of Joiakim, the
son of Jeshua, the son of Jozadak, and in the days of Nehemiah the ruler
and of Ezra the priest, the scribe.

<span id="an_12:27">12:27</span> And when the time came for the wall of
Jerusalem to be made holy, they sent for the Levites out of all their
places to come to Jerusalem, to keep the feast with joy, and with praise
and melody, with brass and corded instruments of music.

<span id="an_12:28">12:28</span> And the sons of the music-makers came
together from the lowland round about Jerusalem and from the
daughter-towns of the Netophathites,

<span id="an_12:29">12:29</span> And from Beth-gilgal and from the
fields of Geba and Azmaveth: for the music-makers had made
daughter-towns for themselves round about Jerusalem.

<span id="an_12:30">12:30</span> And the priests and the Levites made
themselves clean; and they made the people clean, and the doorways and
the wall.

<span id="an_12:31">12:31</span> Then I made the rulers of Judah come up
on the wall, and I put in position two great bands of them who gave
praise, walking in ordered lines; one went to the right on the wall, in
the direction of the doorway where the waste was put;

<span id="an_12:32">12:32</span> And after them went Hoshaiah and half
of the rulers of Judah,

<span id="an_12:33">12:33</span> And Azariah, Ezra, and Meshullam,

<span id="an_12:34">12:34</span> Judah and Benjamin and Shemaiah and
Jeremiah,

<span id="an_12:35">12:35</span> And certain of the priests' sons with
wind instruments; Zechariah, the son of Jonathan, the son of Shemaiah,
the son of Mattaniah, the son of Micaiah, the son of Zaccur, the son of
Asaph,

<span id="an_12:36">12:36</span> And his brothers, Shemaiah, and Azarel,
Milalai, Gilalai, Maai, Nethanel and Judah, Hanani, with the
music-instruments of David, the man of God; and Ezra the scribe was at
their head;

<span id="an_12:37">12:37</span> And by the doorway of the fountain and
straight in front of them, they went up by the steps of the town of
David, at the slope up of the wall, over the house of David, as far as
the water-doorway to the east.

<span id="an_12:38">12:38</span> And the other band of those who gave
praise went to the left, and I went after them with half the people, on
the wall, over the tower of the ovens, as far as the wide wall;

<span id="an_12:39">12:39</span> And over the doorway of Ephraim and by
the old door and the fish door and the tower of Hananel and the tower of
Hammeah, as far as the sheep door: and at the doorway of the watchmen
they came to a stop.

<span id="an_12:40">12:40</span> So the two bands of those who gave
praise took up their positions in the house of God, and I and half of
the chiefs with me:

<span id="an_12:41">12:41</span> And the priests; Eliakim, Maaseiah,
Miniamin, Micaiah, Elioenai, Zechariah, and Hananiah, with wind
instruments;

<span id="an_12:42">12:42</span> And Maaseiah and Shemaiah and Eleazar
and Uzzi and Jehohanan and Malchijah and Elam and Ezer. And the makers
of melody made their voices loud, with Jezrahiah their overseer.

<span id="an_12:43">12:43</span> And on that day they made great
offerings and were glad; for God had made them glad with great joy; and
the women and the children were glad with them: so that the joy of
Jerusalem came to the ears of those who were far off.

<span id="an_12:44">12:44</span> And on that day certain men were put
over the rooms where the things which had been given were stored, for
the lifted offerings and the first-fruits and the tenths, and to take
into them the amounts, from the fields of every town, fixed by the law
for the priests and the Levites: for Judah was glad on account of the
priests and the Levites who were in their places.

<span id="an_12:45">12:45</span> And they kept the watch of their God,
and were responsible for making things clean, and so did the
music-makers and the door-keepers, as it was ordered by David and
Solomon his son.

<span id="an_12:46">12:46</span> For in the days of David and Asaph in
the past, there was a master of the music, and songs of blessing and
praise to God.

<span id="an_12:47">12:47</span> And all Israel in the days of
Zerubbabel and in the days of Nehemiah gave what was needed by the
music-makers and the door-keepers day by day: and they made the
offerings holy for the Levites; and the Levites did the same for the
sons of Aaron.

<span id="an_13:1">13:1</span> On that day there was a reading from the
book of Moses in the hearing of the people; and they saw that it said in
the book that no Ammonite or Moabite might ever come into the meeting of
God;

<span id="an_13:2">13:2</span> Because they did not give the children of
Israel bread and water when they came to them, but got Balaam to put a
curse on them: though the curse was turned into a blessing by our God.

<span id="an_13:3">13:3</span> So after hearing the law, they took out
of Israel all the mixed people.

<span id="an_13:4">13:4</span> Now before this, Eliashib the priest, who
had been placed over the rooms of the house of our God, being a friend
of Tobiah,

<span id="an_13:5">13:5</span> Had made ready for him a great room,
where at one time they kept the meal offerings, the perfume, and the
vessels and the tenths of the grain and wine and oil which were given by
order to the Levites and the music-makers and the door-keepers, and the
lifted offerings for the priests.

<span id="an_13:6">13:6</span> But all this time I was not at Jerusalem:
for in the thirty-second year of Artaxerxes, king of Babylon, I went to
the king; and after some days, I got the king to let me go,

<span id="an_13:7">13:7</span> And I came to Jerusalem; and it was clear
to me what evil Eliashib had done for Tobiah, in making ready for him a
room in the buildings of the house of God.

<span id="an_13:8">13:8</span> And it was evil in my eyes: so I had all
Tobiah's things put out of the room.

<span id="an_13:9">13:9</span> Then I gave orders, and they made the
rooms clean: and I put back in them the vessels of the house of God,
with the meal offerings and the perfume.

<span id="an_13:10">13:10</span> And I saw that the Levites had not been
given what was needed for their support; so that the Levites and the
music-makers, who did the work, had gone away, everyone to his field.

<span id="an_13:11">13:11</span> Then I made protests to the chiefs, and
said, Why has the house of God been given up? And I got them together
and put them in their places.

<span id="an_13:12">13:12</span> Then all Judah came with the tenth part
of the grain and wine and oil and put it into the store-houses.

<span id="an_13:13">13:13</span> And I made controllers over the
store-houses, Shelemiah the priest and Zadok the scribe, and of the
Levites, Pedaiah: and with them was Hanan, the son of Zaccur the son of
Mattaniah: they were taken to be true men and their business was the
distribution of these things to their brothers.

<span id="an_13:14">13:14</span> Keep me in mind, O my God, in
connection with this, and do not let the good which I have done for the
house of my God and its worship go from your memory completely.

<span id="an_13:15">13:15</span> In those days, I saw in Judah some who
were crushing grapes on the Sabbath, and getting in grain and putting it
on asses; as well as wine and grapes and figs and all sorts of goods
which they took into Jerusalem on the Sabbath day: and I gave witness
against them on the day when they were marketing food.

<span id="an_13:16">13:16</span> And there were men of Tyre there, who
came with fish and all sorts of goods, trading with the children of
Judah and in Jerusalem on the Sabbath.

<span id="an_13:17">13:17</span> Then I made protests to the chiefs of
Judah, and said to them, What is this evil which you are doing, not
keeping the Sabbath day holy?

<span id="an_13:18">13:18</span> Did not your fathers do the same, and
did not our God send all this evil on us and on this town? but you are
causing more wrath to come on Israel by not keeping the Sabbath holy.

<span id="an_13:19">13:19</span> And so, when the streets of Jerusalem
were getting dark before the Sabbath, I gave orders for the doors to be
shut and not to be open again till after the Sabbath: and I put some of
my servants by the door so that nothing might be taken in on the Sabbath
day.

<span id="an_13:20">13:20</span> So the traders in all sorts of goods
took their night's rest outside Jerusalem once or twice.

<span id="an_13:21">13:21</span> Then I gave witness against them and
said, Why are you waiting all night by the wall? if you do so again I
will have you taken prisoners. From that time they did not come again on
the Sabbath.

<span id="an_13:22">13:22</span> And I gave the Levites orders to make
themselves clean and come and keep the doors and make the Sabbath holy.
Keep this in mind to my credit, O my God, and have mercy on me, for
great is your mercy.

<span id="an_13:23">13:23</span> And in those days I saw the Jews who
were married to women of Ashdod and Ammon and Moab:

<span id="an_13:24">13:24</span> And their children were talking half in
the language of Ashdod; they had no knowledge of the Jews' language, but
made use of the language of the two peoples.

<span id="an_13:25">13:25</span> And I took up the cause against them,
cursing them and giving blows to some of them and pulling out their
hair; and I made them take an oath by God, saying, You are not to give
your daughters to their sons or take their daughters for your sons or
for yourselves.

<span id="an_13:26">13:26</span> Was it not in these things that
Solomon, king of Israel, did wrong? among a number of nations there was
no king like him, and he was dear to his God, and God made him king over
all Israel: but even he was made to do evil by strange women.

<span id="an_13:27">13:27</span> Are we then without protest to let you
do all this great evil, sinning against our God by taking strange women
for your wives?

<span id="an_13:28">13:28</span> And one of the sons of Joiada, the son
of Eliashib, the chief priest, was son-in-law to Sanballat the Horonite:
so I sent him away from me.

<span id="an_13:29">13:29</span> Keep them in mind, O my God, because
they have put shame on the priests' name and on the agreement of the
priests and the Levites.
