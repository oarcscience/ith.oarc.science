<p><A NAME="an_1:1">1:1</A>&nbsp;Happy is the man who does not go in the company of sinners, or take his place in the way of evil-doers, or in the seat of those who do not give honour to the Lord.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:2">1:2</A>&nbsp;But whose delight is in the law of the Lord, and whose mind is on his law day and night.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:3">1:3</A>&nbsp;He will be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, which gives its fruit at the right time, whose leaves will ever be green; and he will do well in all his undertakings.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:4">1:4</A>&nbsp;The evil-doers are not so; but are like the dust from the grain, which the wind takes away.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:5">1:5</A>&nbsp;For this cause there will be no mercy for sinners when they are judged, and the evil-doers will have no place among the upright,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:6">1:6</A>&nbsp;Because the Lord sees the way of the upright, but the end of the sinner is destruction.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:1">2:1</A>&nbsp;Why are the nations so violently moved, and why are the thoughts of the people so foolish?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:2">2:2</A>&nbsp;The kings of the earth have taken their place, and the rulers are fixed in their purpose, against the Lord, and against the king of his selection, saying,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:3">2:3</A>&nbsp;Let their chains be broken, and their cords taken from off us.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:4">2:4</A>&nbsp;Then he whose seat is in the heavens will be laughing: the Lord will make sport of them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:5">2:5</A>&nbsp;Then will his angry words come to their ears, and by his wrath they will be troubled:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:6">2:6</A>&nbsp;But I have put my king on my holy hill of Zion.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:7">2:7</A>&nbsp;I will make clear the Lord's decision: he has said to me, You are my son, this day have I given you being.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:8">2:8</A>&nbsp;Make your request to me, and I will give you the nations for your heritage, and the farthest limits of the earth will be under your hand.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:9">2:9</A>&nbsp;They will be ruled by you with a rod of iron; they will be broken like a potter's vessel.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:10">2:10</A>&nbsp;So now be wise, you kings: take his teaching, you judges of the earth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:11">2:11</A>&nbsp;Give worship to the Lord with fear, kissing his feet and giving him honour,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:12">2:12</A>&nbsp;For fear that he may be angry, causing destruction to come on you, because he is quickly moved to wrath. Happy are all those who put their faith in him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:1">3:1</A>&nbsp;&lt;A Psalm. Of David. When he went in flight from Absalom his son.&gt; Lord, how greatly are they increased who make attacks on me! in great numbers they come against me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:2">3:2</A>&nbsp;Unnumbered are those who say of my soul, There is no help for him in God. (Selah.)</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:3">3:3</A>&nbsp;But your strength, O Lord, is round me, you are my glory and the lifter up of my head.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:4">3:4</A>&nbsp;I send up a cry to the Lord with my voice, and he gives me an answer from his holy hill. (Selah.)</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:5">3:5</A>&nbsp;I took my rest in sleep, and then again I was awake; for the Lord was my support.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:6">3:6</A>&nbsp;I will have no fear, though ten thousand have come round me, putting themselves against me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:7">3:7</A>&nbsp;Come to me, Lord; keep me safe, O my God; for you have given all my haters blows on their face-bones; the teeth of the evil-doers have been broken by you.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:8">3:8</A>&nbsp;Salvation comes from the Lord; your blessing is on your people. (Selah.)</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:1">4:1</A>&nbsp;&lt;To the chief music-maker on corded instruments. A Psalm. Of David.&gt; Give answer to my cry, O God of my righteousness; make me free from my troubles; have mercy on me, and give ear to my prayer.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:2">4:2</A>&nbsp;O you sons of men, how long will you go on turning my glory into shame? how long will you give your love to foolish things, going after what is false? (Selah.)</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:3">4:3</A>&nbsp;See how the Lord has made great his mercy for me; the Lord will give ear to my cry.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:4">4:4</A>&nbsp;Let there be fear in your hearts, and do no sin; have bitter feelings on your bed, but make no sound. (Selah.)</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:5">4:5</A>&nbsp;Give the offerings of righteousness, and put your faith in the Lord.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:6">4:6</A>&nbsp;There are numbers who say, Who will do us any good? the light of his face has gone from us.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:7">4:7</A>&nbsp;Lord, you have put joy in my heart, more than they have when their grain and their wine are increased.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:8">4:8</A>&nbsp;I will take my rest on my bed in peace, because you only, Lord, keep me safe.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:1">5:1</A>&nbsp;&lt;To the chief music-maker on wind instruments. A Psalm. Of David.&gt; Give ear to my words, O Lord; give thought to my heart-searchings.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:2">5:2</A>&nbsp;Let the voice of my cry come to you, my King and my God; for to you will I make my prayer.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:3">5:3</A>&nbsp;My voice will come to you in the morning, O Lord; in the morning will I send my prayer to you, and keep watch.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:4">5:4</A>&nbsp;For you are not a God who takes pleasure in wrongdoing; there is no evil with you.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:5">5:5</A>&nbsp;The sons of pride have no place before you; you are a hater of all workers of evil.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:6">5:6</A>&nbsp;You will send destruction on those whose words are false; the cruel man and the man of deceit are hated by the Lord.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:7">5:7</A>&nbsp;But as for me, I will come into your house, in the full measure of your mercy; and in your fear I will give worship, turning my eyes to your holy Temple.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:8">5:8</A>&nbsp;Be my guide, O Lord, in the ways of your righteousness, because of those who are against me; make your way straight before my face.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:9">5:9</A>&nbsp;For no faith may be put in their words; their inner part is nothing but evil; their throat is like an open place for the dead; smooth are the words of their tongues.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:10">5:10</A>&nbsp;Send them to destruction, O Lord; let their evil designs be the cause of their fall; let them be forced out by all their sins; because they have gone against your authority.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:11">5:11</A>&nbsp;But let all those who put their faith in you be glad with cries of joy at all times, and let all the lovers of your name be glad in you.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:12">5:12</A>&nbsp;For you, Lord, will send a blessing on the upright man; your grace will be round him, and you will be his strength.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:1">6:1</A>&nbsp;&lt;To the chief music-maker on corded instruments, on the Sheminith. A Psalm. Of David.&gt; O Lord, do not be bitter with me in your wrath; do not send punishment on me in the heat of your passion.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:2">6:2</A>&nbsp;Have mercy on me, O Lord, for I am wasted away: make me well, for even my bones are troubled.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:3">6:3</A>&nbsp;My soul is in bitter trouble; and you, O Lord, how long?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:4">6:4</A>&nbsp;Come back, O Lord, make my soul free; O give me salvation because of your mercy.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:5">6:5</A>&nbsp;For in death there is no memory of you; in the underworld who will give you praise?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:6">6:6</A>&nbsp;The voice of my sorrow is a weariness to me; all the night I make my bed wet with weeping; it is watered by the drops flowing from my eyes.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:7">6:7</A>&nbsp;My eyes are wasting away with trouble; they are becoming old because of all those who are against me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:8">6:8</A>&nbsp;Go from me, all you workers of evil; for the Lord has given ear to the voice of my weeping.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:9">6:9</A>&nbsp;The Lord has given ear to my request; the Lord has let my prayer come before him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:10">6:10</A>&nbsp;Let all those who are against me be shamed and deeply troubled; let them be turned back and suddenly put to shame.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:1">7:1</A>&nbsp;&lt;Shiggaion of David; a song which he made to the Lord, about the words of Cush the Benjamite.&gt; O Lord my God, I put my faith in you; take me out of the hands of him who is cruel to me, and make me free;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:2">7:2</A>&nbsp;So that he may not come rushing on my soul like a lion, wounding it, while there is no one to be my saviour.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:3">7:3</A>&nbsp;O Lord my God, if I have done this; if my hands have done any wrong;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:4">7:4</A>&nbsp;If I have given back evil to him who did evil to me, or have taken anything from him who was against me without cause;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:5">7:5</A>&nbsp;Let my hater go after my soul and take it; let my life be crushed to the earth, and my honour into the dust. (Selah.)</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:6">7:6</A>&nbsp;Come up, Lord, in your wrath; be lifted up against my haters; be awake, my God, give orders for the judging.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:7">7:7</A>&nbsp;The meeting of the nations will be round you; take your seat, then, over them, on high.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:8">7:8</A>&nbsp;The Lord will be judge of the peoples; give a decision for me, O Lord, because of my righteousness, and let my virtue have its reward.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:9">7:9</A>&nbsp;O let the evil of the evil-doer come to an end, but give strength to the upright: for men's minds and hearts are tested by the God of righteousness.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:10">7:10</A>&nbsp;God, who is the saviour of the upright in heart, is my breastplate.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:11">7:11</A>&nbsp;God is the judge of the upright, and is angry with the evil-doers every day.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:12">7:12</A>&nbsp;If a man is not turned from his evil, he will make his sword sharp; his bow is bent and ready.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:13">7:13</A>&nbsp;He has made ready for him the instruments of death; he makes his arrows flames of fire.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:14">7:14</A>&nbsp;That man is a worker of evil; the seed of wrongdoing has given birth to deceit.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:15">7:15</A>&nbsp;He has made a hole deep in the earth, and is falling into the hole which he has made</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:16">7:16</A>&nbsp;His wrongdoing will come back to him, and his violent behaviour will come down on his head.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:17">7:17</A>&nbsp;I will give praise to the Lord for his righteousness; I will make a song to the name of the Lord Most High.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:1">8:1</A>&nbsp;&lt;To the chief music-maker on the Gittith. A Psalm. Of David.&gt; O Lord, our Lord, whose glory is higher than the heavens, how noble is your name in all the earth!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:2">8:2</A>&nbsp;You have made clear your strength even out of the mouths of babies at the breast, because of those who are against you; so that you may put to shame the cruel and violent man.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:3">8:3</A>&nbsp;When I see your heavens, the work of your fingers, the moon and the stars, which you have put in their places;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:4">8:4</A>&nbsp;What is man, that you keep him in mind? the son of man, that you take him into account?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:5">8:5</A>&nbsp;For you have made him only a little lower than the gods, crowning him with glory and honour.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:6">8:6</A>&nbsp;You have made him ruler over the works of your hands; you have put all things under his feet;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:7">8:7</A>&nbsp;All sheep and oxen, and all the beasts of the field;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:8">8:8</A>&nbsp;The birds of the air and the fish of the sea, and whatever goes through the deep waters of the seas.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:9">8:9</A>&nbsp;O Lord, our Lord, how noble is your name in all the earth!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:1">9:1</A>&nbsp;&lt;To the chief music-maker on Muthlabben. A Psalm. Of David.&gt; I will give you praise, O Lord, with all my heart; I will make clear all the wonder of your works.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:2">9:2</A>&nbsp;I will be glad and have delight in you: I will make a song of praise to your name, O Most High.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:3">9:3</A>&nbsp;When my haters are turned back, they will be broken and overcome before you.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:4">9:4</A>&nbsp;For you gave approval to my right and my cause; you were seated in your high place judging in righteousness.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:5">9:5</A>&nbsp;You have said sharp words to the nations, you have sent destruction on the sinners, you have put an end to their name for ever and ever.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:6">9:6</A>&nbsp;You have given their towns to destruction; the memory of them has gone; they have become waste for ever.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:7">9:7</A>&nbsp;But the Lord is King for ever: he has made ready his high seat for judging.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:8">9:8</A>&nbsp;And he will be the judge of the world in righteousness, giving true decisions for the peoples.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:9">9:9</A>&nbsp;The Lord will be a high tower for those who are crushed down, a high tower in times of trouble;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:10">9:10</A>&nbsp;And those who have knowledge of your name will put their faith in you; because you, Lord, have ever given your help to those who were waiting for you.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:11">9:11</A>&nbsp;Make songs of praise to the Lord, whose house is in Zion: make his doings clear to the people.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:12">9:12</A>&nbsp;When he makes search for blood, he has them in his memory: he is not without thought for the cry of the poor.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:13">9:13</A>&nbsp;Have mercy on me, O Lord, and see how I am troubled by my haters; let me be lifted up from the doors of death;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:14">9:14</A>&nbsp;So that I may make clear all your praise in the house of the daughter of Zion: I will be glad because of your salvation.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:15">9:15</A>&nbsp;The nations have gone down into the hole which they made: in their secret net is their foot taken.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:16">9:16</A>&nbsp;The Lord has given knowledge of himself through his judging: the evil-doer is taken in the net which his hands had made. (Higgaion. Selah.)</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:17">9:17</A>&nbsp;The sinners and all the nations who have no memory of God will be turned into the underworld.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:18">9:18</A>&nbsp;For the poor will not be without help; the hopes of those in need will not be crushed for ever.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:19">9:19</A>&nbsp;Up! O Lord; let not man overcome you: let the nations be judged before you.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:20">9:20</A>&nbsp;Put them in fear, O Lord, so that the nations may see that they are only men. (Selah.)</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:1">10:1</A>&nbsp;Why do you keep far away, O Lord? why are you not to be seen in times of trouble?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:2">10:2</A>&nbsp;The evil-doer in his pride is cruel to the poor; let him be taken by the tricks of his invention.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:3">10:3</A>&nbsp;For the evil-doer is lifted up because of the purpose of his heart, and he whose mind is fixed on wealth is turned away from the Lord, saying evil against him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:4">10:4</A>&nbsp;The evil-doer in his pride says, God will not make a search. All his thoughts are, There is no God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:5">10:5</A>&nbsp;His ways are ever fixed; your decisions are higher than he may see: as for his haters, they are as nothing to him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:6">10:6</A>&nbsp;He has said in his heart, I will not be moved: through all generations I will never be in trouble.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:7">10:7</A>&nbsp;His mouth is full of cursing and deceit and false words: under his tongue are evil purposes and dark thoughts.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:8">10:8</A>&nbsp;He is waiting in the dark places of the towns: in the secret places he puts to death those who have done no wrong: his eyes are secretly turned against the poor.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:9">10:9</A>&nbsp;He keeps himself in a secret place like a lion in his hole, waiting to put his hands on the poor man, and pulling him into his net.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:10">10:10</A>&nbsp;The upright are crushed and made low, and the feeble are overcome by his strong ones.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:11">10:11</A>&nbsp;He says in his heart, God has no memory of me: his face is turned away; he will never see it.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:12">10:12</A>&nbsp;Up! O Lord; let your hand be lifted: give thought to the poor.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:13">10:13</A>&nbsp;Why has the evil-doer a low opinion of God, saying in his heart, You will not make search for it?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:14">10:14</A>&nbsp;You have seen it; for your eyes are on sorrow and grief, to take it into your hand: the poor man puts his faith in you; you have been the helper of the child who has no father.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:15">10:15</A>&nbsp;Let the arm of the sinner and the evil-doer be broken; go on searching for his sin till there is no more.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:16">10:16</A>&nbsp;The Lord is King for ever and ever; the nations are gone from his land.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:17">10:17</A>&nbsp;Lord, you have given ear to the prayer of the poor: you will make strong their hearts, you will give them a hearing:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:18">10:18</A>&nbsp;To give decision for the child without a father and for the broken-hearted, so that the man of the earth may no longer be feared.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:1">11:1</A>&nbsp;&lt;For the chief music-maker. Of David.&gt; In the Lord put I my faith; how will you say to my soul, Go in flight like a bird to the mountain?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:2">11:2</A>&nbsp;See, the bows of the evil-doers are bent, they make ready their arrows on the cord, so that they may send them secretly against the upright in heart.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:3">11:3</A>&nbsp;If the bases are broken down, what is the upright man to do?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:4">11:4</A>&nbsp;The Lord is in his holy Temple, the Lord's seat is in heaven; his eyes are watching and testing the children of men.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:5">11:5</A>&nbsp;The Lord puts the upright and the sinner to the test, but he has hate in his soul for the lover of violent acts.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:6">11:6</A>&nbsp;On the evil-doer he will send down fire and flames, and a burning wind; with these will their cup be full.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:7">11:7</A>&nbsp;For the Lord is upright; he is a lover of righteousness: the upright will see his face.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:1">12:1</A>&nbsp;&lt;For the chief music-maker on the Sheminith. A Psalm. Of David.&gt; Send help, Lord, for mercy has come to an end; there is no more faith among the children of men.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:2">12:2</A>&nbsp;Everyone says false words to his neighbour: their tongues are smooth in their talk, and their hearts are full of deceit.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:3">12:3</A>&nbsp;The smooth lips and the tongue of pride will be cut off by the Lord.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:4">12:4</A>&nbsp;They have said, With our tongues will we overcome; our lips are ours: who is lord over us?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:5">12:5</A>&nbsp;Because of the crushing of the poor and the weeping of those in need, now will I come to his help, says the Lord; I will give him the salvation which he is desiring.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:6">12:6</A>&nbsp;The words of the Lord are true words: like silver tested by fire and burned clean seven times.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:7">12:7</A>&nbsp;You will keep them, O Lord, you will keep them safe from this generation for ever.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:8">12:8</A>&nbsp;The sinners are walking on every side, and evil is honoured among the children of men.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:1">13:1</A>&nbsp;&lt;To the chief music-maker. A Psalm. Of David.&gt; Will you for ever put me out of your memory, O Lord? will your face for ever be turned away from me?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:2">13:2</A>&nbsp;How long is my soul to be in doubt, with sorrow in my heart all the day? how long will he who is against me be given power over me?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:3">13:3</A>&nbsp;Let my voice come before you, and give me an answer, O Lord my God; let your light be shining on me, so that the sleep of death may not overtake me;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:4">13:4</A>&nbsp;And he who is against me may not say, I have overcome him; and those who are troubling me may not be glad when I am moved.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:5">13:5</A>&nbsp;But I have had faith in your mercy; my heart will be glad in your salvation.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:6">13:6</A>&nbsp;I will make a song to the Lord, because he has given me my reward.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:1">14:1</A>&nbsp;&lt;To the chief music-maker. Of David.&gt; The foolish man has said in his heart, God will not do anything. They are unclean, they have done evil works; there is not one who does good.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:2">14:2</A>&nbsp;The Lord was looking down from heaven on the children of men, to see if there were any who had wisdom, searching after God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:3">14:3</A>&nbsp;They have all gone out of the way together; they are unclean, there is not one who does good, no, not one.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:4">14:4</A>&nbsp;Have all the workers of evil no knowledge? they take my people for food as they would take bread; they make no prayer to the Lord.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:5">14:5</A>&nbsp;Then were they in great fear: for God is in the generation of the upright.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:6">14:6</A>&nbsp;You have put to shame the thoughts of the poor, but the Lord is his support.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:7">14:7</A>&nbsp;May the salvation of Israel come out of Zion! when the fate of his people is changed by the Lord, Jacob will have joy and Israel will be glad.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_18:10">18:10</A>&nbsp;And he went in flight through the air, seated on a storm-cloud: going quickly on the wings of the wind.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:11">18:11</A>&nbsp;He made the dark his secret place; his tent round him was the dark waters and thick clouds of the skies.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_18:13">18:13</A>&nbsp;The Lord made thunder in the heavens, and the voice of the Highest was sounding out: a rain of ice and fire.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:14">18:14</A>&nbsp;He sent out his arrows, driving them in all directions; by his flames of fire they were troubled.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:15">18:15</A>&nbsp;Then the deep beds of the waters were seen, and the bases of the world were uncovered, because of your words of wrath, O Lord, because of the breath from your mouth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:16">18:16</A>&nbsp;He sent from on high, he took me, pulling me out of great waters.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:17">18:17</A>&nbsp;He made me free from my strong hater, and from those who were against me, because they were stronger than I.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:18">18:18</A>&nbsp;They came on me in the day of my trouble; but the Lord was my support.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:19">18:19</A>&nbsp;He took me out into a wide place; he was my saviour because he had delight in me.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_18:33">18:33</A>&nbsp;He makes my feet like roes' feet, and puts me on high places.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:34">18:34</A>&nbsp;He makes my hands expert in war, so that a bow of brass is bent by my arms.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:35">18:35</A>&nbsp;You have given me the breastplate of your salvation: your right hand has been my support, and your mercy has made me great.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_52:1">52:1</A>&nbsp;&lt;To the chief music-maker. Maschil. Of David. When Doeg the Edomite came to Saul saying, David has come to the house of Ahimelech.&gt; Why do you take pride in wrongdoing, lifting yourself up against the upright man all the day?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_52:2">52:2</A>&nbsp;Purposing destruction, using deceit; your tongue is like a sharp blade.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_52:3">52:3</A>&nbsp;You have more love for evil than for good, for deceit than for works of righteousness. (Selah.)</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_52:4">52:4</A>&nbsp;Destruction is in all your words, O false tongue.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_52:5">52:5</A>&nbsp;But God will put an end to you for ever; driving you out from your tent, uprooting you from the land of the living. (Selah.)</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_52:6">52:6</A>&nbsp;The upright will see it with fear, and will say, laughing at you:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_52:7">52:7</A>&nbsp;See, this is the man who did not make God his strength, but had faith in his goods and his property, and made himself strong in his wealth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_52:8">52:8</A>&nbsp;But I am like a branching olive-tree in the house of God; I have put my faith in his mercy for ever and ever.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_52:9">52:9</A>&nbsp;I will give you praise without end for what you have done; I will give honour to your name before your saints, for it is good.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_53:1">53:1</A>&nbsp;&lt;To the chief music-maker; put to Mahalath. Maschil. Of David.&gt; The foolish man has said in his heart, God will not do anything. They are unclean, they have done evil works; there is not one who does good.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_53:2">53:2</A>&nbsp;God was looking down from heaven on the children of men, to see if there were any who had wisdom, searching after God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_53:3">53:3</A>&nbsp;Every one of them has gone back; they are unclean: there is not one who does good, no, not one.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_53:4">53:4</A>&nbsp;Have the workers of evil no knowledge? they take my people for food, as they would take bread; they make no prayer to God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_53:5">53:5</A>&nbsp;They were in great fear, where there was no cause for fear: for the bones of those who make war on you have been broken by God; you have put them to shame, because God has no desire for them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_53:6">53:6</A>&nbsp;May the salvation of Israel come out of Zion! When the fate of his people is changed by God, Jacob will have joy, and Israel will be glad.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_54:1">54:1</A>&nbsp;&lt;To the chief music-maker; on Neginoth. Maschil. Of David. When the Ziphites came and said to Saul, Is not David keeping himself secret among us?&gt; Let your name be my salvation, O God; let my cause be judged by your strength.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_54:2">54:2</A>&nbsp;Let my prayer come before you, O God; give ear to the words of my mouth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_54:3">54:3</A>&nbsp;For men who are going after me have come out against me, violent men are purposing to take my soul; they have not put God before their eyes. (Selah.)</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_54:4">54:4</A>&nbsp;See, God is my helper: the Lord is the great supporter of my soul.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_54:5">54:5</A>&nbsp;Let the evil works of my haters come back on them again; let them be cut off by your good faith.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_54:7">54:7</A>&nbsp;Because it has been my saviour from all my trouble; and my eyes have seen the punishment of my haters.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_55:1">55:1</A>&nbsp;&lt;To the chief music-maker, on Neginoth. Maschil. Of David.&gt; Give hearing to my prayer, O God; and let not your ear be shut against my request.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_55:2">55:2</A>&nbsp;Give thought to me, and let my prayer be answered: I have been made low in sorrow;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_55:3">55:3</A>&nbsp;I am troubled because of the voice of the cruel ones, because of the loud cry of the evil-doers; for they put a weight of evil on me, and they are cruel in their hate for me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_55:4">55:4</A>&nbsp;My heart is deeply wounded, and the fear of death has come on me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_55:5">55:5</A>&nbsp;Fear and shaking have come over me, with deep fear I am covered.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_55:6">55:6</A>&nbsp;And I said, If only I had wings like a dove! for then I would go in flight from here and be at rest.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_55:7">55:7</A>&nbsp;I would go wandering far away, living in the waste land. (Selah.)</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_55:8">55:8</A>&nbsp;I would quickly take cover from the driving storm and from the violent wind.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_55:9">55:9</A>&nbsp;Send destruction on them, O Lord, make a division of tongues among them: for I have seen fighting and violent acts in the town.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_55:10">55:10</A>&nbsp;By day and night they go round the town, on the walls; trouble and sorrow are in the heart of it.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_55:11">55:11</A>&nbsp;Evil is there; cruel rule and deceit are ever in the streets.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_55:12">55:12</A>&nbsp;For it was not my hater who said evil of me; that would have been no grief to me; it was not one outside the number of my friends who made himself strong against me, or I would have kept myself from him in a secret place;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_55:13">55:13</A>&nbsp;But it was you, my equal, my guide, my well-loved friend.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_55:14">55:14</A>&nbsp;We had loving talk together, and went to the house of God in company.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_55:15">55:15</A>&nbsp;Let the hand of death come on them suddenly, and let them go down living into the underworld; because evil is in their houses and in their hearts.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_55:16">55:16</A>&nbsp;As for me, I will make my prayer to God, and he will be my saviour.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_55:17">55:17</A>&nbsp;In the evening and in the morning and in the middle of the day I will make my prayer with sounds of grief; and my voice will come to his ears.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_55:18">55:18</A>&nbsp;He has taken my soul away from the attack which was made against me, and given it peace; for great numbers were against me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_55:19">55:19</A>&nbsp;God will give thought to me; he who from early times is strong will send pain and trouble on them. (Selah.) Because they are unchanged, they have no fear of God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_55:20">55:20</A>&nbsp;He has put out his hand against those who were at peace with him; he has not kept his agreement.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_55:21">55:21</A>&nbsp;The words of his mouth were smoother than butter, but war was in his heart; his words were softer than oil, but they were sharp swords.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_55:22">55:22</A>&nbsp;Put your cares on the Lord, and he will be your support; he will not let the upright man be moved.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_55:23">55:23</A>&nbsp;But you, O God, will send them down into the underworld; the cruel and the false will be cut off before half their days are ended; but I will have faith in you.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_56:1">56:1</A>&nbsp;&lt;To the chief music-maker; put to Jonath elem rehokim. Of David. Michtam. When the Philistines took him in Gath.&gt; Have mercy on me, O God, for man is attempting my destruction; every day he makes cruel attacks against me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_56:2">56:2</A>&nbsp;My haters are ever ready to put an end to me; great numbers are lifting themselves up against me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_56:3">56:3</A>&nbsp;In the time of my fear, I will have faith in you.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_56:4">56:4</A>&nbsp;In God will I give praise to his word; in God have I put my hope; I will have no fear of what flesh may do to me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_56:5">56:5</A>&nbsp;Every day they make wrong use of my words; all their thoughts are against me for evil.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_56:6">56:6</A>&nbsp;They come together, they are waiting in secret places, they take note of my steps, they are waiting for my soul.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_56:7">56:7</A>&nbsp;By evil-doing they will not get free from punishment. In wrath, O God, let the peoples be made low.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_56:8">56:8</A>&nbsp;You have seen my wanderings; put the drops from my eyes into your bottle; are they not in your record?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_56:9">56:9</A>&nbsp;When I send up my cry to you, my haters will be turned back; I am certain of this, for God is with me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_56:10">56:10</A>&nbsp;In God will I give praise to his word; in the Lord will I give praise to his word.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_56:11">56:11</A>&nbsp;In God have I put my hope, I will have no fear of what man may do to me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_56:12">56:12</A>&nbsp;I keep the memory of my debt to you, O God; I will give you the offerings of praise.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_56:13">56:13</A>&nbsp;Because you have taken my soul from the power of death; and kept my feet from falling, so that I may be walking before God in the light of life.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_57:1">57:1</A>&nbsp;&lt;To the chief music-maker; put to Al-tashheth. Michtam. Of David.

<p><A NAME="an_57:2">57:2</A>&nbsp;I will send up my cry to the Most High God; to God who does all things for me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_57:3">57:3</A>&nbsp;He will send from heaven, and take me from the power of him whose desire is for my destruction. God will send out his mercy and his good faith.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_57:4">57:4</A>&nbsp;My soul is among lions; I am stretched out among those who are on fire, even the sons of men, whose teeth are spears and arrows, and whose tongue is a sharp sword.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_57:5">57:5</A>&nbsp;O God, be lifted up higher than the heavens; let your glory be over all the earth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_57:6">57:6</A>&nbsp;They have made ready a net for my steps; my soul is bent down; they have made a great hole before me, and have gone down into it themselves. (Selah.)</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_57:7">57:7</A>&nbsp;My heart is fixed, O God, my heart is fixed; I will make songs, and give praise.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_57:8">57:8</A>&nbsp;You are my glory; let the instruments of music be awake; I myself will be awake with the dawn.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_57:9">57:9</A>&nbsp;I will give you praise, O Lord, among the peoples; I will make songs to you among the nations.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_57:10">57:10</A>&nbsp;For your mercy is great, stretching up to the heavens, and your righteousness goes up to the clouds.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_57:11">57:11</A>&nbsp;Be lifted up, O God, higher than the heavens, let your glory be over all the earth.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_58:2">58:2</A>&nbsp;The purposes of your hearts are evil; your hands are full of cruel doings on the earth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_58:3">58:3</A>&nbsp;The evil-doers are strange from the first; from the hour of their birth they go out of the true way, saying false words.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_58:5">58:5</A>&nbsp;Who will not be moved by the voice of the wonder-worker, however great are his powers.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_58:6">58:6</A>&nbsp;O God, let their teeth be broken in their mouths; let the great teeth of the young lions be pulled out, O Lord.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_58:7">58:7</A>&nbsp;Let them be turned to liquid like the ever-flowing waters; let them be cut off like the grass by the way.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_58:8">58:8</A>&nbsp;Let them be like an after-birth which is turned to water and comes to an end; like the fruit of a woman who gives birth before her time, let them not see the sun.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_59:8">59:8</A>&nbsp;But you are laughing at them, O Lord; you will make sport of all the nations.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_59:9">59:9</A>&nbsp;O my strength, I will put my hope in you; because God is my strong tower.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_73:2">73:2</A>&nbsp;But as for me, my feet had almost gone from under me; I was near to slipping;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_73:3">73:3</A>&nbsp;Because of my envy of the men of pride, when I saw the well-being of the wrongdoers.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_73:4">73:4</A>&nbsp;For they have no pain; their bodies are fat and strong.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_73:5">73:5</A>&nbsp;They are not in trouble as others are; they have no part in the unhappy fate of men.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_73:6">73:6</A>&nbsp;For this reason pride is round them like a chain; they are clothed with violent behaviour as with a robe.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_73:7">73:7</A>&nbsp;Their eyes are bursting with fat; they have more than their heart's desire.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_73:8">73:8</A>&nbsp;Their thoughts are deep with evil designs; their talk from their seats of power is of cruel acts.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_73:9">73:9</A>&nbsp;Their mouth goes up to heaven; their tongues go walking through the earth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_73:10">73:10</A>&nbsp;For this reason they are full of bread; and water is ever flowing for them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_73:11">73:11</A>&nbsp;And they say, How will the Lord see this? is there knowledge in the Most High?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_73:12">73:12</A>&nbsp;Truly, such are the sinners; they do well at all times, and their wealth is increased.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_73:13">73:13</A>&nbsp;As for me, I have made my heart clean to no purpose, washing my hands in righteousness;</p>

<p><A NAME="an_73:15">73:15</A>&nbsp;If I would make clear what it is like, I would say, You are false to the generation of your children.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_73:16">73:16</A>&nbsp;When my thoughts were turned to see the reason of this, it was a weariness in my eyes;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_73:17">73:17</A>&nbsp;Till I went into God's holy place, and saw the end of the evil-doers.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_73:18">73:18</A>&nbsp;You put their feet where there was danger of slipping, so that they go down into destruction.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_73:19">73:19</A>&nbsp;How suddenly are they wasted! fears are the cause of their destruction.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_73:20">73:20</A>&nbsp;As a dream when one is awake, they are ended; they are like an image gone out of mind when sleep is over.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_73:21">73:21</A>&nbsp;My heart was made bitter, and I was pained by the bite of grief:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_73:22">73:22</A>&nbsp;As for me, I was foolish, and without knowledge; I was like a beast before you.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_73:23">73:23</A>&nbsp;But still I am ever with you; you have taken me by my right hand.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_73:24">73:24</A>&nbsp;Your wisdom will be my guide, and later you will put me in a place of honour.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_73:25">73:25</A>&nbsp;Whom have I in heaven but you? and having you I have no desire for anything on earth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_73:26">73:26</A>&nbsp;My flesh and my heart are wasting away: but God is the Rock of my heart and my eternal heritage.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_73:27">73:27</A>&nbsp;For those who are far away from you will come to destruction: you will put an end to all those who have not kept faith with you.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_73:28">73:28</A>&nbsp;But it is good for me to come near to God: I have put my faith in the Lord God, so that I may make clear all his works.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_74:1">74:1</A>&nbsp;&lt;Maschil. Of Asaph.&gt; Of God, why have you put us away from you for ever? why is the fire of your wrath smoking against the sheep who are your care?</p>

<p><A NAME="an_74:4">74:4</A>&nbsp;Sending out their voices like lions among your worshippers; they have put up their signs to be seen.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_74:5">74:5</A>&nbsp;They are cutting down, like a man whose blade is lifted up against the thick trees.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_74:6">74:6</A>&nbsp;Your doors are broken down with hammers and iron blades.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_74:7">74:7</A>&nbsp;They have put on fire your holy place; they have made the place of your name unclean, pulling it down to the earth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_74:8">74:8</A>&nbsp;They have said in their hearts, Let us put an end to them all together; they have given over to the fire all God's places of worship in the land.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_74:9">74:9</A>&nbsp;We do not see our signs: there is no longer any prophet, or anyone among us to say how long.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_74:12">74:12</A>&nbsp;For from the past God is my King, working salvation in the earth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_74:13">74:13</A>&nbsp;The sea was parted in two by your strength; the heads of the great sea-beasts were broken.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_74:14">74:14</A>&nbsp;The heads of the great snake were crushed by you; you gave them as food to the fishes of the sea.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_74:15">74:15</A>&nbsp;You made valleys for fountains and springs; you made the ever-flowing rivers dry.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_74:16">74:16</A>&nbsp;The day is yours and the night is yours: you made the light and the sun.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_74:20">74:20</A>&nbsp;Keep in mind your undertaking; for the dark places of the earth are full of pride and cruel acts.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_78:3">78:3</A>&nbsp;Which have come to our hearing and our knowledge, as they were given to us by our fathers.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:4">78:4</A>&nbsp;We will not keep them secret from our children; we will make clear to the coming generation the praises of the Lord and his strength, and the great works of wonder which he has done.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:5">78:5</A>&nbsp;He put up a witness in Jacob, and made a law in Israel; which he gave to our fathers so that they might give knowledge of them to their children;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:6">78:6</A>&nbsp;So that the generation to come might have knowledge of them, even the children of the future, who would give word of them to their children;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:7">78:7</A>&nbsp;So that they might put their hope in God, and not let God's works go out of their minds, but keep his laws;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:8">78:8</A>&nbsp;And not be like their fathers, a stiff-necked and uncontrolled generation; a generation whose heart was hard, whose spirit was not true to God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:9">78:9</A>&nbsp;The children of Ephraim, armed with bows, were turned back on the day of the fight.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:10">78:10</A>&nbsp;They were not ruled by God's word, and they would not go in the way of his law;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:11">78:11</A>&nbsp;They let his works go out of their memory, and the wonders which he had made them see.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:12">78:12</A>&nbsp;He did great works before the eyes of their fathers, in the land of Egypt, in the fields of Zoan.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:13">78:13</A>&nbsp;The sea was cut in two so that they might go through; the waters were massed together on this side and on that.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:14">78:14</A>&nbsp;In the daytime he was guiding them in the cloud, and all through the night with a light of fire.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:15">78:15</A>&nbsp;The rocks of the waste land were broken by his power, and he gave them drink as out of the deep waters.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:16">78:16</A>&nbsp;He made streams come out of the rock; and waters came flowing down like rivers.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:17">78:17</A>&nbsp;And they went on sinning against him even more, turning away from the Most High in the waste land;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:18">78:18</A>&nbsp;Testing God in their hearts, requesting meat for their desire.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:19">78:19</A>&nbsp;They said bitter words against God, saying, Is God able to make ready a table in the waste land?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:20">78:20</A>&nbsp;See, the rock was cut open by his power, so that the water came rushing out, and overflowing streams; is he able to give us bread? is he able to get meat for his people?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:21">78:21</A>&nbsp;So these things came to the Lord's ears, and he was angry; and a fire was lighted against Jacob, and wrath came up against Israel;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:22">78:22</A>&nbsp;Because they had no faith in God, and no hope in his salvation.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:23">78:23</A>&nbsp;And he gave orders to the clouds on high, and the doors of heaven were open;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:24">78:24</A>&nbsp;And he sent down manna like rain for their food, and gave them the grain of heaven.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:25">78:25</A>&nbsp;Man took part in the food of strong ones; he sent them meat in full measure.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:26">78:26</A>&nbsp;He sent an east wind from heaven, driving on the south wind by his power.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:27">78:27</A>&nbsp;He sent down meat on them like dust, and feathered birds like the sand of the sea,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:28">78:28</A>&nbsp;And he let it come down into their resting-place, round about their tents.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:29">78:29</A>&nbsp;So they had food and were full; for he gave them their desire;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:30">78:30</A>&nbsp;But they were not turned from their desires; and while the food was still in their mouths,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:31">78:31</A>&nbsp;The wrath of God came on them, and put to death the fattest of them, and put an end to the young men of Israel.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:32">78:32</A>&nbsp;For all this they went on sinning even more, and had no faith in his great wonders.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:33">78:33</A>&nbsp;So their days were wasted like a breath, and their years in trouble.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:34">78:34</A>&nbsp;When he sent death on them, then they made search for him; turning to him and looking for him with care;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:35">78:35</A>&nbsp;In the memory that God was their Rock, and the Most High God their saviour.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:36">78:36</A>&nbsp;But their lips were false to him, and their tongues were untrue to him;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:37">78:37</A>&nbsp;And their hearts were not right with him, and they did not keep their agreement with him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:38">78:38</A>&nbsp;But he, being full of pity, has forgiveness for sin, and does not put an end to man: frequently turning back his wrath, and not being violently angry.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:39">78:39</A>&nbsp;So he kept in mind that they were only flesh; a breath which is quickly gone, and will not come again.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:40">78:40</A>&nbsp;How frequently did they go against him in the waste land, and give him cause for grief in the dry places!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:41">78:41</A>&nbsp;Again they put God to the test, and gave pain to the Holy One of Israel.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:42">78:42</A>&nbsp;They did not keep in mind the work of his hand, or the day when he took them from the power of their haters;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:43">78:43</A>&nbsp;How he had done his signs in Egypt, and his wonders in the field of Zoan;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:44">78:44</A>&nbsp;So that their rivers were turned to blood, and they were not able to get drink from their streams.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:45">78:45</A>&nbsp;He sent different sorts of flies among them, poisoning their flesh; and frogs for their destruction.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:46">78:46</A>&nbsp;He gave the increase of their fields to worms, the fruits of their industry to the locusts.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:47">78:47</A>&nbsp;He sent ice for the destruction of their vines; their trees were damaged by the bitter cold.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:48">78:48</A>&nbsp;Ice was rained down on their cattle; thunderstorms sent destruction among the flocks.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:49">78:49</A>&nbsp;He sent on them the heat of his wrath, his bitter disgust, letting loose evil angels among them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:50">78:50</A>&nbsp;He let his wrath have its way; he did not keep back their soul from death, but gave their life to disease.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:51">78:51</A>&nbsp;He gave to destruction all the first sons of Egypt; the first-fruits of their strength in the tents of Ham;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:52">78:52</A>&nbsp;But he took his people out like sheep, guiding them in the waste land like a flock.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:53">78:53</A>&nbsp;He took them on safely so that they had no fear; but their haters were covered by the sea.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:54">78:54</A>&nbsp;And he was their guide to his holy land, even to the mountain, which his right hand had made his;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:55">78:55</A>&nbsp;Driving out nations before them, marking out the line of their heritage, and giving the people of Israel their tents for a resting-place.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:56">78:56</A>&nbsp;But they were bitter against the Most High God, testing him, and not keeping his laws;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:57">78:57</A>&nbsp;Their hearts were turned back and untrue like their fathers; they were turned to one side like a twisted bow.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:58">78:58</A>&nbsp;They made him angry with their high places; moving him to wrath with their images.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:59">78:59</A>&nbsp;When this came to God's ears he was very angry, and gave up Israel completely;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:60">78:60</A>&nbsp;So that he went away from the holy place in Shiloh, the tent which he had put among men;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:61">78:61</A>&nbsp;And he let his strength be taken prisoner, and gave his glory into the hands of his hater.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:62">78:62</A>&nbsp;He gave his people up to the sword, and was angry with his heritage.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:63">78:63</A>&nbsp;Their young men were burned in the fire; and their virgins were not praised in the bride-song.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:64">78:64</A>&nbsp;Their priests were put to death by the sword, and their widows made no weeping for them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:65">78:65</A>&nbsp;Then was the Lord like one awaking from sleep, and like a strong man crying out because of wine.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:66">78:66</A>&nbsp;His haters were turned back by his blows and shamed for ever.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:67">78:67</A>&nbsp;And he put the tent of Joseph on one side, and took not the tribe of Ephraim;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:68">78:68</A>&nbsp;But he took the tribe of Judah for himself, and the mountain of Zion, in which he had pleasure.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:69">78:69</A>&nbsp;And he made his holy place like the high heaven, like the earth which is fixed by him for ever.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:70">78:70</A>&nbsp;He took David to be his servant, taking him from the place of the flocks;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:71">78:71</A>&nbsp;From looking after the sheep which were giving milk, he took him to give food to Jacob his people, and to Israel his heritage.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:72">78:72</A>&nbsp;So he gave them food with an upright heart, guiding them by the wisdom of his hands.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_79:1">79:1</A>&nbsp;&lt;A Psalm. Of Asaph.&gt; O God, the nations have come into your heritage; they have made your holy Temple unclean; they have made Jerusalem a mass of broken walls.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_79:3">79:3</A>&nbsp;Their blood has been flowing like water round about Jerusalem; there was no one to put them in their last resting-place.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_79:4">79:4</A>&nbsp;We are looked down on by our neighbours, we are laughed at and made sport of by those who are round us.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_79:5">79:5</A>&nbsp;How long, O Lord? will you be angry for ever? will your wrath go on burning like fire?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_79:6">79:6</A>&nbsp;Let your wrath be on the nations who have no knowledge of you, and on the kingdoms who have not made prayer to your name.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_79:7">79:7</A>&nbsp;For they have taken Jacob for their meat, and made waste his house.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_79:8">79:8</A>&nbsp;Do not keep in mind against us the sins of our fathers; let your mercy come to us quickly, for we have been made very low.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_79:9">79:9</A>&nbsp;Give us help, O God of our salvation, for the glory of your name; take us out of danger and give us forgiveness for our sins, because of your name.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_79:10">79:10</A>&nbsp;Why may the nations say, Where is their God? Let payment for the blood of your servants be made openly among the nations before our eyes.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_79:11">79:11</A>&nbsp;Let the cry of the prisoner come before you; with your strong arm make free the children of death;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_79:12">79:12</A>&nbsp;And give punishment seven times over into the breast of our neighbours for the bitter words which they have said against you, O Lord.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_79:13">79:13</A>&nbsp;So we your people, and the sheep of your flock, will give you glory for ever: we will go on praising you through all generations.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_80:1">80:1</A>&nbsp;&lt;To the chief music-maker; put to Shoshannim-eduth. Of Asaph. A Psalm.&gt; Give ear, O Keeper of Israel, guiding Joseph like a flock; you who have your seat on the winged ones, let your glory be seen.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_80:2">80:2</A>&nbsp;Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh, let your strength be awake from sleep, and come as our salvation.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_80:4">80:4</A>&nbsp;O Lord God of armies, how long will your wrath be burning against the rest of your people?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_80:5">80:5</A>&nbsp;You have given them the bread of weeping for food; for their drink you have given them sorrow in great measure.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_80:6">80:6</A>&nbsp;You make us a cause of war among our neighbours; our haters are laughing at us among themselves.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_80:7">80:7</A>&nbsp;Take us back again, O God of armies; let us see the shining of your face, and let us be safe.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_80:8">80:8</A>&nbsp;You took a vine out of Egypt: driving out the nations, and planting it in their land.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_80:9">80:9</A>&nbsp;You made ready a place for it, so that it might take deep root, and it sent out its branches over all the land.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_80:10">80:10</A>&nbsp;The mountains were covered with its shade, and the great trees with its branches.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_80:11">80:11</A>&nbsp;It sent out its arms to the Sea, and its branches to the River.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_80:12">80:12</A>&nbsp;Why are its walls broken down by your hands, so that all who go by may take its fruit?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_80:13">80:13</A>&nbsp;It is uprooted by the pigs from the woods, the beasts of the field get their food from it.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_80:14">80:14</A>&nbsp;Come back, O God of armies: from heaven let your eyes be turned to this vine, and give your mind to it,</p>

<p><A NAME="an_80:16">80:16</A>&nbsp;It is burned with fire; it is cut down: they are made waste by the wrath of your face.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_80:17">80:17</A>&nbsp;Let your hand be on the man of your right hand, on the son of man whom you made strong for yourself.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_81:5">81:5</A>&nbsp;He gave it to Joseph as a witness, when he went out over the land of Egypt; then the words of a strange tongue were sounding in my ears.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_81:6">81:6</A>&nbsp;I took the weight from his back; his hands were made free from the baskets.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_81:7">81:7</A>&nbsp;You gave a cry in your trouble, and I made you free; I gave you an answer in the secret place of the thunder; I put you to the test at the waters of Meribah. (Selah.)</p>

<p><A NAME="an_81:12">81:12</A>&nbsp;So I gave them up to the desires of their hearts; that they might go after their evil purposes.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_81:13">81:13</A>&nbsp;If only my people would give ear to me, walking in my ways!</p>

<p><A NAME="an_83:4">83:4</A>&nbsp;They have said, Come, let us put an end to them as a nation; so that the name of Israel may go out of man's memory.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_83:5">83:5</A>&nbsp;For they have all come to an agreement; they are all joined together against you:</p>

<p><A NAME="an_105:19">105:19</A>&nbsp;Till the time when his word came true; he was tested by the word of the Lord.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_105:20">105:20</A>&nbsp;The king sent men to take off his chains; even the ruler of the people, who let him go free.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_105:21">105:21</A>&nbsp;He made him lord of his house, and ruler over everything he had;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_105:22">105:22</A>&nbsp;To give his chiefs teaching at his pleasure, and so that his law-givers might get wisdom from him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_105:23">105:23</A>&nbsp;Then Israel came into Egypt, and Jacob was living in the land of Ham.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_105:24">105:24</A>&nbsp;And his people were greatly increased, and became stronger than those who were against them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_105:25">105:25</A>&nbsp;Their hearts were turned to hate against his people, so that they made secret designs against them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_105:26">105:26</A>&nbsp;He sent Moses, his servant, and Aaron, the man of his selection.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_105:27">105:27</A>&nbsp;He let his signs be seen among the people, and his wonders in the land of Ham.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_105:28">105:28</A>&nbsp;He sent black night and made it dark; and they did not go against his word.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_105:29">105:29</A>&nbsp;At his word their waters were turned to blood, and he sent death on all their fish.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_105:30">105:30</A>&nbsp;Their land was full of frogs, even in the rooms of the king.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_105:31">105:31</A>&nbsp;He gave the word, and there came the dog-fly, and insects over all the land.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_105:32">105:32</A>&nbsp;He gave them ice for rain, and flaming fire in their land.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_105:33">105:33</A>&nbsp;He gave their vines and their fig-trees to destruction, and the trees of their land were broken down.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_105:34">105:34</A>&nbsp;At his word the locusts came, and young locusts more than might be numbered,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_105:35">105:35</A>&nbsp;And put an end to all the plants of their land, taking all the fruit of the earth for food.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_105:36">105:36</A>&nbsp;He put to death the first child of every family in the land, the first-fruits of their strength.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_105:37">105:37</A>&nbsp;He took his people out with silver and gold: there was not one feeble person among them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_105:38">105:38</A>&nbsp;Egypt was glad when they went; for the fear of them had come down on them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_105:39">105:39</A>&nbsp;A cloud was stretched over them for a cover; and he sent fire to give light in the night.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_105:40">105:40</A>&nbsp;At the people's request he sent birds, and gave them the bread of heaven for food.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_105:41">105:41</A>&nbsp;His hand made the rock open, and the waters came streaming out; they went down through the dry places like a river.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_105:42">105:42</A>&nbsp;For he kept in mind his holy word, and Abraham, his servant.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_105:43">105:43</A>&nbsp;And he took his people out with joy, the men of his selection with glad cries:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_105:44">105:44</A>&nbsp;And gave them the lands of the nations; and they took the work of the peoples for a heritage;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_105:45">105:45</A>&nbsp;So that they might keep his orders, and be true to his laws. Give praise to the Lord.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_106:1">106:1</A>&nbsp;Let the Lord be praised. O give praise to the Lord, for he is good: for his mercy is unchanging for ever.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_106:2">106:2</A>&nbsp;Who is able to give an account of the great acts of the Lord, or to make clear all his praise?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_106:3">106:3</A>&nbsp;Happy are they whose decisions are upright, and he who does righteousness at all times.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_106:4">106:4</A>&nbsp;Keep me in mind, O Lord, when you are good to your people; O let your salvation come to me;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_106:5">106:5</A>&nbsp;So that I may see the well-being of the people of your selection, and have a part in the joy of your nation, and take pride in your heritage.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_106:6">106:6</A>&nbsp;We are sinners like our fathers, we have done wrong, our acts are evil.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_106:7">106:7</A>&nbsp;Our fathers did not give thought to your wonders in Egypt; they did not keep in memory the great number of your mercies, but gave you cause for wrath at the sea, even at the Red Sea.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_106:8">106:8</A>&nbsp;But he was their saviour because of his name, so that men might see his great power.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_106:9">106:9</A>&nbsp;By his word the Red Sea was made dry: and he took them through the deep waters as through the waste land.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_106:10">106:10</A>&nbsp;And he took them safely out of the hands of their haters, and kept them from the attacks of those who were against them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_106:11">106:11</A>&nbsp;And the waters went over their haters; all of them came to an end.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_106:12">106:12</A>&nbsp;Then they had faith in his words; they gave him songs of praise.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_106:13">106:13</A>&nbsp;But their memory of his works was short; not waiting to be guided by him,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_106:14">106:14</A>&nbsp;They gave way to their evil desires in the waste land, and put God to the test in the dry places.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_106:15">106:15</A>&nbsp;And he gave them their request, but sent a wasting disease into their souls.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_106:16">106:16</A>&nbsp;They were full of envy against Moses among the tents, and against Aaron, the holy one of the Lord.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_106:17">106:17</A>&nbsp;The earth opening put an end to Dathan, covering up Abiram and his band.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_106:18">106:18</A>&nbsp;And a fire was lighted among their tents; the sinners were burned up by the flames.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_106:19">106:19</A>&nbsp;They made a young ox in Horeb, and gave worship to an image of gold.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_106:20">106:20</A>&nbsp;And their glory was changed into the image of an ox, whose food is grass.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_106:21">106:21</A>&nbsp;They had no memory of God their saviour, who had done great things in Egypt;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_106:22">106:22</A>&nbsp;Works of wonder in the land of Ham, and things of fear by the Red Sea.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_106:23">106:23</A>&nbsp;And he was purposing to put an end to them if Moses, his special servant, had not gone up before him, between him and his people, turning back his wrath, to keep them from destruction.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_106:24">106:24</A>&nbsp;They were disgusted with the good land; they had no belief in his word;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_106:25">106:25</A>&nbsp;Talking against him secretly in their tents, they did not give ear to the voice of the Lord.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_106:26">106:26</A>&nbsp;So he made an oath against them, to put an end to them in the waste land:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_106:27">106:27</A>&nbsp;That their children might be mixed among the nations, and sent away into other lands.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_106:28">106:28</A>&nbsp;And they were joined to Baal-peor, and took part in the offerings to the dead.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_106:29">106:29</A>&nbsp;So they made him angry by their behaviour; and he sent disease on them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_106:30">106:30</A>&nbsp;Then Phinehas got up, and made prayer for them; and the disease went no farther.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_106:31">106:31</A>&nbsp;And all the generations coming after him kept the memory of his righteousness for ever.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_106:32">106:32</A>&nbsp;They made God angry again at the waters of Meribah, so that Moses was troubled because of them;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_106:33">106:33</A>&nbsp;For they made his spirit bitter, and he said unwise things.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_106:34">106:34</A>&nbsp;They did not put an end to the peoples, as the Lord had said;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_106:35">106:35</A>&nbsp;But they were joined to the nations, learning their works.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_106:36">106:36</A>&nbsp;And they gave worship to images; which were a danger to them:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_106:37">106:37</A>&nbsp;They even made offerings of their sons and their daughters to evil spirits,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_106:38">106:38</A>&nbsp;And gave the blood of their sons and their daughters who had done no wrong, offering them to the images of Canaan; and the land was made unclean with blood.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_106:39">106:39</A>&nbsp;So they became unclean through their works, going after their evil desires.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_106:40">106:40</A>&nbsp;Then the wrath of the Lord was burning against his people, and he was angry with his heritage.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_106:41">106:41</A>&nbsp;And he gave them into the hands of the nations; and they were ruled by their haters.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_106:42">106:42</A>&nbsp;By them they were crushed, and made low under their hands.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_106:43">106:43</A>&nbsp;Again and again he made them free; but their hearts were turned against his purpose, and they were overcome by their sins.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_106:44">106:44</A>&nbsp;But when their cry came to his ears, he had pity on their trouble:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_106:45">106:45</A>&nbsp;And kept in mind his agreement with them, and in his great mercy gave them forgiveness.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_106:46">106:46</A>&nbsp;He put pity into the hearts of those who made them prisoners.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_106:47">106:47</A>&nbsp;Be our saviour, O Lord our God, and let us come back together from among the nations, so that we may give honour to your holy name, and have glory in your praise.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_106:48">106:48</A>&nbsp;Praise be to the Lord God of Israel for ever and for ever; and let all the people say, So be it. Give praise to the Lord.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_107:1">107:1</A>&nbsp;O give praise to the Lord, for he is good: for his mercy is unchanging for ever.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_107:2">107:2</A>&nbsp;Let those whose cause the Lord has taken up say so, his people whom he has taken out of the hands of their haters;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_107:3">107:3</A>&nbsp;Making them come together out of all the lands, from the east and from the west, from the north and from the south.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_107:4">107:4</A>&nbsp;They were wandering in the waste places; they saw no way to a resting-place.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_107:5">107:5</A>&nbsp;Their souls became feeble for need of food and drink.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_107:6">107:6</A>&nbsp;Then they sent up their cry to the Lord in their sorrow, and he gave them salvation out of all their troubles;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_107:7">107:7</A>&nbsp;Guiding them in the right way, so that they might come into the town of their resting-place.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_107:8">107:8</A>&nbsp;Let men give praise to the Lord for his mercy, and for the wonders which he does for the children of men!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_107:9">107:9</A>&nbsp;He gives its desire to the unresting soul, so that it is full of good things.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_107:10">107:10</A>&nbsp;Those who were in the dark, in the black night, in chains of sorrow and iron;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_107:11">107:11</A>&nbsp;Because they went against the words of God, and gave no thought to the laws of the Most High:</p>

<p><A NAME="an_107:13">107:13</A>&nbsp;Then they sent up their cry to the Lord in their sorrow, and he gave them salvation out of all their troubles.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_107:14">107:14</A>&nbsp;He took them out of the dark and the black night, and all their chains were broken.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_107:15">107:15</A>&nbsp;Let men give praise to the Lord for his mercy, and for the wonders which he does for the children of men!</p>

<p><A NAME="an_107:19">107:19</A>&nbsp;Then they send up their cry to the Lord in their sorrow, and he gives them salvation out of all their troubles.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_107:20">107:20</A>&nbsp;He sent his word and made them well, and kept them safe from the underworld.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_107:21">107:21</A>&nbsp;Let men give praise to the Lord for his mercy, and for the wonders which he does for the children of men!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_107:22">107:22</A>&nbsp;Let them make offerings of praise, giving news of his works with cries of joy.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_107:23">107:23</A>&nbsp;Those who go down to the sea in ships, who do business in the great waters;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_107:24">107:24</A>&nbsp;They see the works of the Lord, and his wonders in the deep.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_107:25">107:25</A>&nbsp;For at his word comes up the storm-wind, lifting high the waves.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_107:26">107:26</A>&nbsp;The sailors go up to heaven, and down into the deep; their souls are wasted because of their trouble.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_107:27">107:27</A>&nbsp;They are turned here and there, rolling like a man who is full of wine; and all their wisdom comes to nothing.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_107:29">107:29</A>&nbsp;He makes the storm into a calm, so that the waves are at peace.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_107:30">107:30</A>&nbsp;Then they are glad, because the sea is quiet, and he takes them to the harbour of their desire.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_107:31">107:31</A>&nbsp;Let men give praise to the Lord for his mercy, and for the wonders which he does for the children of men!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_107:32">107:32</A>&nbsp;Let them give glory to him in the meeting of the people, and praise among the chiefs.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_107:33">107:33</A>&nbsp;He makes rivers into waste places, and springs of water into a dry land;</p>
