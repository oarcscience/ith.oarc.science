### Basic English Bible: Zephaniah

<span id="an_1:1">1:1</span> The word of the Lord which came to
Zephaniah, the son of Cushi, the son of Gedaliah, the son of Amariah,
the son of Hezekiah, in the days of Josiah, the son of Amon, king of
Judah.

<span id="an_1:2">1:2</span> I will take away everything from the face
of the earth, says the Lord.

<span id="an_1:3">1:3</span> I will take away man and beast; I will take
away the birds of the heaven and the fishes of the sea; causing the
downfall of the evil-doers, and cutting man off from the face of the
earth, says the Lord.

<span id="an_1:4">1:4</span> And my hand will be stretched out on Judah
and on all the people of Jerusalem, cutting off the name of the Baal
from this place, and the name of the false priests,

<span id="an_1:5">1:5</span> And the worshippers of the army of heaven
on the house-tops, and the Lord's worshippers who take oaths by Milcom,

<span id="an_1:6">1:6</span> And those who are turned back from going
after the Lord, and those who have not made prayer to the Lord or got
directions from him.

<span id="an_1:7">1:7</span> Let there be no sound before the Lord God:
for the day of the Lord is near: for the Lord has made ready an
offering, he has made his guests holy.

<span id="an_1:8">1:8</span> And it will come about in the day of the
Lord's offering, that I will send punishment on the rulers and the
king's sons and all who are clothed in robes from strange lands.

<span id="an_1:9">1:9</span> And in that day I will send punishment on
all those who come jumping over the doorstep and make their master's
house full of violent behaviour and deceit.

<span id="an_1:10">1:10</span> And in that day, says the Lord, there
will be the sound of a cry from the fish doorway, and an outcry from the
new town, and a great thundering from the hills, and cries of grief from
the people of the Hollow;

<span id="an_1:11">1:11</span> Because of the downfall of all the people
of Canaan: all those who were weighted down with silver have been cut
off.

<span id="an_1:12">1:12</span> And it will come about at that time, that
I will go searching through Jerusalem with lights; and I will send
punishment on the men who have become like wine stored over-long, who
say to themselves, The Lord will not do good and will not do evil.

<span id="an_1:13">1:13</span> And their wealth will be violently taken
away, and their houses will be made waste: they will go on building
houses and never living in them, and planting vine-gardens but not
drinking the wine from them.

<span id="an_1:14">1:14</span> The great day of the Lord is near, it is
near and coming very quickly; the bitter day of the Lord is near, coming
on more quickly than a man of war.

<span id="an_1:15">1:15</span> That day is a day of wrath, a day of
trouble and sorrow, a day of wasting and destruction, a day of dark
night and deep shade, a day of cloud and thick dark.

<span id="an_1:16">1:16</span> A day of sounding the horn and the
war-cry against the walled towns and the high towers.

<span id="an_1:17">1:17</span> And I will send trouble on men so that
they will go about like the blind, because they have done evil against
the Lord: and their blood will be drained out like dust, and their
strength like waste.

<span id="an_1:18">1:18</span> Even their silver and their gold will not
be able to keep them safe in the day of the Lord's wrath; but all the
land will be burned up in the fire of his bitter wrath: for he will put
an end, even suddenly, to all who are living in the land.

<span id="an_2:1">2:1</span> Come together, make everyone come together,
O nation without shame;

<span id="an_2:2">2:2</span> Before the Lord sends you violently away in
flight like the waste from the grain; before the burning wrath of the
Lord comes on you, before the day of the Lord's wrath comes on you.

<span id="an_2:3">2:3</span> Make search for the Lord, all you quiet
ones of the earth, who have done what is right in his eyes; make search
for righteousness and a quiet heart: it may be that you will be safely
covered in the day of the Lord's wrath.

<span id="an_2:4">2:4</span> For Gaza will be given up and Ashkelon will
become waste: they will send Ashdod out in the middle of the day, and
Ekron will be uprooted.

<span id="an_2:5">2:5</span> Sorrow to the people living by the sea, the
nation of the Cherethites! The word of the Lord is against you, O
Canaan, the land of the Philistines; I will send destruction on you till
there is no one living in you.

<span id="an_2:6">2:6</span> And the land by the sea will be grass-land,
with houses for keepers of sheep and walled places for flocks.

<span id="an_2:7">2:7</span> The land by the sea will be for the rest of
the children of Judah; by the sea they will give their flocks food: in
the houses of Ashkelon they will take their rest in the evening; for the
Lord their God will take them in hand and their fate will be changed.

<span id="an_2:8">2:8</span> My ears have been open to the bitter words
of Moab and the words of shame of the children of Ammon, which they have
said against my people, lifting themselves up against the limit of their
land.

<span id="an_2:9">2:9</span> For this cause, by my life, says the Lord
of armies, the God of Israel, truly Moab will become like Sodom and the
children of Ammon like Gomorrah, given up to waste plants and salt pools
and unpeopled for ever: the rest of my people will take their property,
the overflow of my nation will take their heritage.

<span id="an_2:10">2:10</span> This will be their fate because of their
pride, because they have said evil, lifting themselves up against the
people of the Lord of armies.

<span id="an_2:11">2:11</span> The Lord will let himself be seen by
them: for he will make all the gods of the earth feeble; and men will go
down before him in worship, everyone from his place, even all the
sea-lands of the nations.

<span id="an_2:12">2:12</span> And you Ethiopians will be put to death
by my sword.

<span id="an_2:13">2:13</span> And his hand will be stretched out
against the north, for the destruction of Assyria; and he will make
Nineveh unpeopled and dry like the waste land.

<span id="an_2:14">2:14</span> And herds will take their rest in the
middle of her, all the beasts of the valley: the pelican and the
porcupine will make their living-places on the tops of its pillars; the
owl will be crying in the window; the raven will be seen on the
doorstep.

<span id="an_2:15">2:15</span> This is the town which was full of joy,
living without fear of danger, saying in her heart, I am, and there is
no other: how has she been made waste, a place for beasts to take their
rest in! everyone who goes by her will make hisses, waving his hand.

<span id="an_3:1">3:1</span> Sorrow to her who is uncontrolled and
unclean, the cruel town!

<span id="an_3:2">3:2</span> She gave no attention to the voice, she had
no use for teaching, she put no faith in the Lord, she did not come near
to her God.

<span id="an_3:3">3:3</span> Her rulers are like loud-voiced lions in
her; her judges are wolves of the evening, crushing up the bones before
the morning.

<span id="an_3:4">3:4</span> Her prophets are good-for-nothing persons,
full of deceit: her priests have made the holy place unclean and have
gone violently against the law.

<span id="an_3:5">3:5</span> The Lord in her is upright; he will not do
evil; every morning he lets his righteousness be seen, he is unchanging;
but the evil-doer has no sense of shame.

<span id="an_3:6">3:6</span> I have had the nations cut off, their
towers are broken down; I have made their streets a waste so that no one
goes through them: destruction has overtaken their towns, so that there
is no man living in them.

<span id="an_3:7">3:7</span> I said, Certainly you will go in fear of
me, and come under my training, so that whatever I may send on her may
not be cut off before her eyes: but they got up early and made all their
works evil.

<span id="an_3:8">3:8</span> For this reason, go on waiting for me, says
the Lord, till the day when I come up as a witness: for my purpose is to
send for the nations and to get the kingdoms together, so that I may let
loose on them my passion, even all my burning wrath: for all the earth
will be burned up in the fire of my bitter passion.

<span id="an_3:9">3:9</span> For then I will give the people a clean
language, so that they may all make prayer to the Lord and be his
servants with one mind.

<span id="an_3:10">3:10</span> From over the rivers of Ethiopia, and
from the sides of the north, they will come to me with an offering.

<span id="an_3:11">3:11</span> In that day you will have no shame on
account of all the things in which you did evil against me: for then I
will take away from among you those who were lifted up in pride, and you
will no longer be lifted up with pride in my holy mountain.

<span id="an_3:12">3:12</span> But I will still have among you a quiet
and poor people, and they will put their faith in the name of the Lord.

<span id="an_3:13">3:13</span> The rest of Israel will do no evil and
say no false words; the tongue of deceit will not be seen in their
mouth: for they will take their food and their rest, and no one will be
a cause of fear to them.

<span id="an_3:14">3:14</span> Make melody, O daughter of Zion; give a
loud cry, O Israel; be glad and let your heart be full of joy, O
daughter of Jerusalem.

<span id="an_3:15">3:15</span> The Lord has taken away those who were
judging you, he has sent your haters far away: the King of Israel, even
the Lord, is among you: you will have no more fear of evil.

<span id="an_3:16">3:16</span> In that day it will be said to Jerusalem,
Have no fear: O Zion, let not your hands be feeble.

<span id="an_3:17">3:17</span> The Lord your God is among you, as a
strong saviour: he will be glad over you with joy, he will make his love
new again, he will make a song of joy over you as in the time of a holy
feast.

<span id="an_3:18">3:18</span> I will take away your troubles, lifting
up your shame from off you.

<span id="an_3:19">3:19</span> See, at that time I will put an end to
all who have been troubling you: I will give salvation to her whose
steps are uncertain, and get together her who has been sent in flight;
and I will make them a cause of praise and an honoured name in all the
earth, when I let their fate be changed.

<span id="an_3:20">3:20</span> At that time I will make you come in, at
that time I will get you together: for I will make you a name and a
praise among all the peoples of the earth when I let your fate be
changed before your eyes, says the Lord.
