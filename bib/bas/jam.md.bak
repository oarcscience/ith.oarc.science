### Basic English Bible: James

<span id="an_1:1">1:1</span> James, a servant of God and of the Lord
Jesus Christ, sends words of love to the twelve tribes of the Jews
living in all parts of the earth.

<span id="an_1:2">1:2</span> Let it be all joy to you, my brothers, when
you undergo tests of every sort;

<span id="an_1:3">1:3</span> Because you have the knowledge that the
testing of your faith gives you the power of going on in hope;

<span id="an_1:4">1:4</span> But let this power have its full effect, so
that you may be made complete, needing nothing.

<span id="an_1:5">1:5</span> But if any man among you is without wisdom,
let him make his request to God, who gives freely to all without an
unkind word, and it will be given to him.

<span id="an_1:6">1:6</span> Let him make his request in faith, doubting
nothing; for he who has doubt in his heart is like the waves of the sea,
which are troubled by the driving of the wind.

<span id="an_1:7">1:7</span> Let it not seem to such a man that he will
get anything from the Lord;

<span id="an_1:8">1:8</span> For there is a division in his mind, and he
is uncertain in all his ways.

<span id="an_1:9">1:9</span> But let the brother of low position be glad
that he is lifted up;

<span id="an_1:10">1:10</span> But the man of wealth, that he is made
low; because like the flower of the grass he will come to his end.

<span id="an_1:11">1:11</span> For when the sun comes up with its
burning heat, the grass gets dry and the grace of its form is gone with
the falling flower; so the man of wealth comes to nothing in his ways.

<span id="an_1:12">1:12</span> There is a blessing on the man who
undergoes testing; because, if he has God's approval, he will be given
the crown of life, which the Lord has said he will give to those who
have love for him.

<span id="an_1:13">1:13</span> Let no man say when he is tested, I am
tested by God; for it is not possible for God to be tested by evil, and
he himself puts no man to such a test:

<span id="an_1:14">1:14</span> But every man is tested when he is turned
out of the right way by the attraction of his desire.

<span id="an_1:15">1:15</span> Then when its time comes, desire gives
birth to sin; and sin, when it is of full growth, gives birth to death.

<span id="an_1:16">1:16</span> Do not be turned from the right way, dear
brothers.

<span id="an_1:17">1:17</span> Every good and true thing is given to us
from heaven, coming from the Father of lights, with whom there is no
change or any shade made by turning.

<span id="an_1:18">1:18</span> Of his purpose he gave us being, by his
true word, so that we might be, in a sense, the first-fruits of all the
things which he had made.

<span id="an_1:19">1:19</span> You have knowledge of this, dear
brothers. But let every man be quick in hearing, slow in words, slow to
get angry;

<span id="an_1:20">1:20</span> For the righteousness of God does not
come about by the wrath of man.

<span id="an_1:21">1:21</span> For this reason, putting away all dirty
behaviour and the overweight of evil, take into your souls without pride
the word which, being planted there, is able to give you salvation.

<span id="an_1:22">1:22</span> But be doers of the word, and not only
hearers of it, blinding yourselves with false ideas.

<span id="an_1:23">1:23</span> Because if any man is a hearer of the
word and not a doer, he is like a man looking at his natural face in a
glass;

<span id="an_1:24">1:24</span> For after looking at himself he goes
away, and in a short time he has no memory of what he was like.

<span id="an_1:25">1:25</span> But he who goes on looking into the true
law which makes him free, being not a hearer without memory but a doer
putting it into effect, this man will have a blessing on his acts.

<span id="an_1:26">1:26</span> If a man seems to have religion and has
no control over his tongue but lets himself be tricked by what is false,
this man's religion is of no value.

<span id="an_1:27">1:27</span> The religion which is holy and free from
evil in the eyes of our God and Father is this: to take care of children
who have no fathers and of widows who are in trouble, and to keep
oneself untouched by the world.

<span id="an_2:1">2:1</span> My brothers, if you have the faith of our
Lord Jesus Christ of glory, do not take a man's position into account.

<span id="an_2:2">2:2</span> For if a man comes into your Synagogue in
fair clothing and with a gold ring, and a poor man comes in with dirty
clothing,

<span id="an_2:3">2:3</span> And you do honour to the man in fair
clothing and say, Come here and take this good place; and you say to the
poor man, Take up your position there, or be seated at my feet;

<span id="an_2:4">2:4</span> Is there not a division in your minds? have
you not become judges with evil thoughts?

<span id="an_2:5">2:5</span> Give ear, my dear brothers; are not those
who are poor in the things of this world marked out by God to have faith
as their wealth, and for their heritage the kingdom which he has said he
will give to those who have love for him?

<span id="an_2:6">2:6</span> But you have put the poor man to shame. Are
not the men of wealth rulers over you? do they not take you by force
before their judges?

<span id="an_2:7">2:7</span> Do they not say evil of the holy name which
was given to you?

<span id="an_2:8">2:8</span> But if you keep the greatest law of all, as
it is given in the holy Writings, Have love for your neighbour as for
yourself, you do well:

<span id="an_2:9">2:9</span> But if you take a man's position into
account, you do evil, and are judged as evil-doers by the law.

<span id="an_2:10">2:10</span> For anyone who keeps all the law, but
makes a slip in one point, is judged to have gone against it all.

<span id="an_2:11">2:11</span> For he who said, Do not be untrue in
married life, is the same who said, Put no man to death. Now if you are
not untrue in married life, but you put a man to death, the law is
broken.

<span id="an_2:12">2:12</span> Let your words and your acts be those of
men who are to be judged by the law which makes free.

<span id="an_2:13">2:13</span> For the man who has had no mercy will be
judged without mercy, but mercy takes pride in overcoming judging.

<span id="an_2:14">2:14</span> What use is it, my brothers, for a man to
say that he has faith, if he does nothing? will such a faith give him
salvation?

<span id="an_2:15">2:15</span> If a brother or a sister is without
clothing and in need of the day's food,

<span id="an_2:16">2:16</span> And one of you says to them, Go in peace,
be warm and full of food; but you do not give them the things of which
their bodies have need, what profit is there in this?

<span id="an_2:17">2:17</span> Even so faith without works is dead.

<span id="an_2:18">2:18</span> But a man may say, You have faith and I
have works; let me see your faith without your works, and I will make my
faith clear to you by my works.

<span id="an_2:19">2:19</span> You have the belief that God is one, and
you do well: the evil spirits have the same belief, shaking with fear.

<span id="an_2:20">2:20</span> Do you not see, O foolish man, that faith
without works is of no use?

<span id="an_2:21">2:21</span> Was not the righteousness of Abraham our
father judged by his works, when he made an offering of Isaac his son on
the altar?

<span id="an_2:22">2:22</span> You see that his faith was helping his
works and was made complete by them;

<span id="an_2:23">2:23</span> And the holy Writings were put into
effect which said, And Abraham had faith in God and it was put to his
account as righteousness; and he was named the friend of God.

<span id="an_2:24">2:24</span> You see that a man's righteousness is
judged by his works and not by his faith only.

<span id="an_2:25">2:25</span> And in the same way, was not the
righteousness of Rahab, the loose woman, judged by her works, when she
took into her house those who were sent and let them go out by another
way?

<span id="an_2:26">2:26</span> For as the body without the spirit is
dead even so faith without works is dead.

<span id="an_3:1">3:1</span> Do not all be teachers, my brothers,
because we teachers will be judged more hardly than others.

<span id="an_3:2">3:2</span> For we all go wrong in a number of things.
If a man never makes a slip in his talk, then he is a complete man and
able to keep all his body in control.

<span id="an_3:3">3:3</span> Now if we put bits of iron into horses'
mouths so that they may be guided by us, we have complete control of
their bodies.

<span id="an_3:4">3:4</span> And again ships, though they are so great
and are moved by violent winds, are turned by a very small
guiding-blade, at the impulse of the man who is using it.

<span id="an_3:5">3:5</span> Even so the tongue is a small part of the
body, but it takes credit for great things. How much wood may be lighted
by a very little fire!

<span id="an_3:6">3:6</span> And the tongue is a fire; it is the power
of evil placed in our bodies, making all the body unclean, putting the
wheel of life on fire, and getting its fire from hell.

<span id="an_3:7">3:7</span> For every sort of beast and bird and every
living thing on earth and in the sea has been controlled by man and is
under his authority;

<span id="an_3:8">3:8</span> But the tongue may not be controlled by
man; it is an unresting evil, it is full of the poison of death.

<span id="an_3:9">3:9</span> With it we give praise to our Lord and
Father; and with it we put a curse on men who are made in God's image.

<span id="an_3:10">3:10</span> Out of the same mouth comes blessing and
cursing. My brothers, it is not right for these things to be so.

<span id="an_3:11">3:11</span> Does the fountain send from the same
outlet sweet and bitter water?

<span id="an_3:12">3:12</span> Is a fig-tree able to give us olives, my
brothers, or do we get figs from a vine, or sweet water from the salt
sea?

<span id="an_3:13">3:13</span> Who has wisdom and good sense among you?
let him make his works clear by a life of gentle wisdom.

<span id="an_3:14">3:14</span> But if you have bitter envy in your heart
and the desire to get the better of others, have no pride in this,
talking falsely against what is true.

<span id="an_3:15">3:15</span> This wisdom is not from heaven, but is of
the earth and the flesh and the Evil One.

<span id="an_3:16">3:16</span> For where envy is, and the desire to get
the better of others, there is no order, but every sort of evil-doing.

<span id="an_3:17">3:17</span> But the wisdom which is from heaven is
first holy, then gentle, readily giving way in argument, full of peace
and mercy and good works, not doubting, not seeming other than it is.

<span id="an_3:18">3:18</span> And the fruit of righteousness is planted
in peace for those who make peace.

<span id="an_4:1">4:1</span> What is the cause of wars and fighting
among you? is it not in your desires which are at war in your bodies?

<span id="an_4:2">4:2</span> You are burning with desire, and have not
your desire, so you put men to death; you are full of envy, and you are
not able to get your desire, so you are fighting and making war; you
have not your desire, because you do not make request for it.

<span id="an_4:3">4:3</span> You make your request but you do not get
it, because your request has been wrongly made, desiring the thing only
so that you may make use of it for your pleasure.

<span id="an_4:4">4:4</span> O you who are false to God, do you not see
that the friends of this world are not God's friends? Every man desiring
to be a friend of this world makes himself a hater of God.

<span id="an_4:5">4:5</span> Or does it seem to you that it is for
nothing that the holy Writings say, The spirit which God put into our
hearts has a strong desire for us?

<span id="an_4:6">4:6</span> But he gives more grace. So that the
Writings say, God is against the men of pride, but he gives grace to
those who make themselves low before him.

<span id="an_4:7">4:7</span> For this cause be ruled by God; but make
war on the Evil One and he will be put to flight before you.

<span id="an_4:8">4:8</span> Come near to God and he will come near to
you. Make your hands clean, you evil-doers; put away deceit from your
hearts, you false in mind.

<span id="an_4:9">4:9</span> Be troubled, with sorrow and weeping; let
your laughing be turned to sorrow and your joy to grief.

<span id="an_4:10">4:10</span> Make yourselves low in the eyes of the
Lord and you will be lifted up by him.

<span id="an_4:11">4:11</span> Do not say evil against one another, my
brothers. He who says evil against his brother or makes himself his
brother's judge, says evil against the law and is judging the law: and
in judging the law you become, not a doer of the law but a judge.

<span id="an_4:12">4:12</span> There is only one judge and law-giver,
even he who has the power of salvation and of destruction; but who are
you to be your neighbour's judge?

<span id="an_4:13">4:13</span> How foolish it is to say, Today or
tomorrow we will go into this town, and be there for a year and do
business there and get wealth:

<span id="an_4:14">4:14</span> When you are not certain what will take
place tomorrow. What is your life? It is a mist, which is seen for a
little time and then is gone.

<span id="an_4:15">4:15</span> But the right thing to say would be, If
it is the Lord's pleasure and if we are still living, we will do this
and that.

<span id="an_4:16">4:16</span> But now you go on glorying in your pride:
and all such glorying is evil.

<span id="an_4:17">4:17</span> The man who has knowledge of how to do
good and does not do it, to him it is sin.

<span id="an_5:1">5:1</span> Come now, you men of wealth, give
yourselves to weeping and crying because of the bitter troubles which
are coming to you.

<span id="an_5:2">5:2</span> Your wealth is unclean and insects have
made holes in your clothing.

<span id="an_5:3">5:3</span> Your gold and your silver are wasted and
their waste will be a witness against you, burning into your flesh. You
have put by your store in the last days.

<span id="an_5:4">5:4</span> See, the money which you falsely kept back
from the workers cutting the grass in your field, is crying out against
you; and the cries of those who took in your grain have come to the ears
of the Lord of armies.

<span id="an_5:5">5:5</span> You have been living delicately on earth
and have taken your pleasure; you have made your hearts fat for a day of
destruction.

<span id="an_5:6">5:6</span> You have given your decision against the
upright man and have put him to death. He puts up no fight against you.

<span id="an_5:7">5:7</span> Go on waiting calmly, my brothers, till the
coming of the Lord, like the farmer waiting for the good fruit of the
earth till the early and late rains have come.

<span id="an_5:8">5:8</span> Be as calm in your waiting; let your hearts
be strong: because the coming of the Lord is near.

<span id="an_5:9">5:9</span> Say no hard things against one another,
brothers, so that you will not be judged; see, the judge is waiting at
the doors.

<span id="an_5:10">5:10</span> Take as an example of pain nobly
undergone and of strength in trouble, the prophets who gave to men the
words of the Lord.

<span id="an_5:11">5:11</span> We say that those men who have gone
through pain are happy: you have the story of Job and the troubles
through which he went and have seen that the Lord was full of pity and
mercy in the end.

<span id="an_5:12">5:12</span> But most of all, my brothers, do not take
oaths, not by the heaven, or by the earth, or by any other thing: but
let your Yes be Yes, and your No be No: so that you may not be judged.

<span id="an_5:13">5:13</span> Is anyone among you in trouble? let him
say prayers. Is anyone glad? let him make a song of praise.

<span id="an_5:14">5:14</span> Is anyone among you ill? let him send for
the rulers of the church; and let them say prayers over him, putting oil
on him in the name of the Lord.

<span id="an_5:15">5:15</span> And by the prayer of faith the man who is
ill will be made well, and he will be lifted up by the Lord, and for any
sin which he has done he will have forgiveness.

<span id="an_5:16">5:16</span> So then, make a statement of your sins to
one another, and say prayers for one another so that you may be made
well. The prayer of a good man is full of power in its working.

<span id="an_5:17">5:17</span> Elijah was a man of flesh and blood as we
are, and he made a strong prayer that there might be no rain; and there
was no rain on the earth for three years and six months.

<span id="an_5:18">5:18</span> And he made another prayer, and the
heaven sent down rain and the earth gave her fruit.

<span id="an_5:19">5:19</span> My brothers, if one of you has gone out
of the way of the true faith and another has made him see his error,

<span id="an_5:20">5:20</span> Be certain that he through whom a sinner
has been turned from the error of his way, keeps a soul from death and
is the cause of forgiveness for sins without number.
