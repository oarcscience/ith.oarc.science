### Basic English Bible: Joel

<span id="an_1:1">1:1</span> The word of the Lord which came to Joel,
the son of Pethuel.

<span id="an_1:2">1:2</span> Give ear to this, you old men, and take
note, you people of the land. Has this ever been in your days, or in the
days of your fathers?

<span id="an_1:3">1:3</span> Give the story of it to your children, and
let them give it to their children, and their children to another
generation.

<span id="an_1:4">1:4</span> What the worm did not make a meal of, has
been taken by the locust; and what the locust did not take, has been
food for the plant-worm; and what the plant-worm did not take, has been
food for the field-fly.

<span id="an_1:5">1:5</span> Come out of your sleep, you who are
overcome with wine, and give yourselves to weeping; give cries of
sorrow, all you drinkers of wine, because of the sweet wine; for it has
been cut off from your mouths.

<span id="an_1:6">1:6</span> For a nation has come up over my land,
strong and without number; his teeth are the teeth of a lion, and he has
the back teeth of a great lion.

<span id="an_1:7">1:7</span> By him my vine is made waste and my
fig-tree broken: he has taken all its fruit and sent it down to the
earth; its branches are made white.

<span id="an_1:8">1:8</span> Make sounds of grief like a virgin dressed
in haircloth for the husband of her early years.

<span id="an_1:9">1:9</span> The meal offering and the drink offering
have been cut off from the house of the Lord; the priests, the Lord's
servants, are sorrowing.

<span id="an_1:10">1:10</span> The fields are wasted, the land has
become dry; for the grain is wasted, the new wine is kept back, the oil
is poor.

<span id="an_1:11">1:11</span> The farmers are shamed, the workers in
the vine-gardens give cries of grief, for the wheat and the barley; for
the produce of the fields has come to destruction.

<span id="an_1:12">1:12</span> The vine has become dry and the fig-tree
is feeble; the pomegranate and the palm-tree and the apple-tree, even
all the trees of the field, are dry: because joy has gone from the sons
of men.

<span id="an_1:13">1:13</span> Put haircloth round you and give
yourselves to sorrow, you priests; give cries of grief, you servants of
the altar: come in, and, clothed in haircloth, let the night go past,
you servants of my God: for the meal offering and the drink offering
have been kept back from the house of your God.

<span id="an_1:14">1:14</span> Let a time be fixed for going without
food, have a holy meeting, let the old men, even all the people of the
land, come together to the house of the Lord your God, crying out to the
Lord.

<span id="an_1:15">1:15</span> Sorrow for the day! for the day of the
Lord is near, and as destruction from the Ruler of all it will come.

<span id="an_1:16">1:16</span> Is not food cut off before our eyes? joy
and delight from the house of our God?

<span id="an_1:17">1:17</span> The grains have become small and dry
under the spade; the store-houses are made waste, the grain-stores are
broken down; for the grain is dry and dead.

<span id="an_1:18">1:18</span> What sounds of pain come from the beasts!
the herds of cattle are at a loss because there is no grass for them;
even the flocks of sheep are no longer to be seen.

<span id="an_1:19">1:19</span> O Lord, my cry goes up to you: for fire
has put an end to the grass-lands of the waste, and all the trees of the
field are burned with its flame.

<span id="an_1:20">1:20</span> The beasts of the field are turning to
you with desire: for the water-streams are dry and fire has put an end
to the grass-lands of the waste.

<span id="an_2:1">2:1</span> Let the horn be sounded in Zion, and a
war-cry in my holy mountain; let all the people of the land be troubled:
for the day of the Lord is coming;

<span id="an_2:2">2:2</span> For a day of dark and deep shade is near, a
day of cloud and black night: like a black cloud a great and strong
people is covering the mountains; there has never been any like them and
will not be after them again, from generation to generation.

<span id="an_2:3">2:3</span> Before them fire sends destruction, and
after them flame is burning: the land is like the garden of Eden before
them, and after them an unpeopled waste; truly, nothing has been kept
safe from them.

<span id="an_2:4">2:4</span> Their form is like the form of horses, and
they are running like war-horses.

<span id="an_2:5">2:5</span> Like the sound of war-carriages they go
jumping on the tops of the mountains; like the noise of a flame of fire
burning up the grain-stems, like a strong people lined up for the fight.

<span id="an_2:6">2:6</span> At their coming the people are bent with
pain: all faces become red together.

<span id="an_2:7">2:7</span> They are running like strong men, they go
over the wall like men of war; every man goes straight on his way, their
lines are not broken.

<span id="an_2:8">2:8</span> No one is pushing against another; everyone
goes straight on his way: bursting through the sword points, their order
is not broken.

<span id="an_2:9">2:9</span> They make a rush on the town, running on
the wall; they go up into the houses and in through the windows like a
thief.

<span id="an_2:10">2:10</span> The earth is troubled before them and the
heavens are shaking: the sun and the moon have become dark, and the
stars keep back their shining:

<span id="an_2:11">2:11</span> And the Lord is thundering before his
forces; for very great is his army; for he is strong who gives effect to
his word: for the day of the Lord is great and greatly to be feared, and
who has strength against it?

<span id="an_2:12">2:12</span> But even now, says the Lord, come back to
me with all your heart, keeping from food, with weeping and with sorrow:

<span id="an_2:13">2:13</span> Let your hearts be broken, and not your
clothing, and come back to the Lord your God: for he is full of grace
and pity, slow to be angry and great in mercy, ready to be turned from
his purpose of punishment.

<span id="an_2:14">2:14</span> May it not be that he will again let his
purpose be changed and let a blessing come after him, even a meal
offering and a drink offering for the Lord your God?

<span id="an_2:15">2:15</span> Let a horn be sounded in Zion, let a time
be fixed for going without food, have a holy meeting:

<span id="an_2:16">2:16</span> Get the people together, make the mass of
the people holy, send for the old men, get together the children and
babies at the breast: let the newly married man come out of his room and
the bride from her tent.

<span id="an_2:17">2:17</span> Let the priests, the servants of the
Lord, be weeping between the covered way and the altar, and let them
say, Have mercy on your people, O Lord, do not give up your heritage to
shame, so that the nations become their rulers: why let them say among
the peoples, Where is their God?

<span id="an_2:18">2:18</span> Then the Lord had a care for the honour
of his land and had pity on his people.

<span id="an_2:19">2:19</span> And the Lord made answer and said to his
people, See, I will send you grain and wine and oil in full measure: and
I will no longer let you be shamed among the nations:

<span id="an_2:20">2:20</span> I will send the one from the north far
away from you, driving him into a dry and waste land, with his front to
the sea of the east and his back to the sea of the west, and the smell
of him will go up, even his evil smell will go up.

<span id="an_2:21">2:21</span> Have no fear, O land; be glad with great
joy; for the Lord has done great things.

<span id="an_2:22">2:22</span> Have no fear, you beasts of the field,
for the grass-lands of the waste are becoming green, for the trees are
producing fruit, the fig-tree and the vine give out their strength.

<span id="an_2:23">2:23</span> Be glad, then, you children of Zion, and
have joy in the Lord your God: for he gives you food in full measure,
making the rain come down for you, the early and the late rain as at the
first.

<span id="an_2:24">2:24</span> And the floors will be full of grain, and
the crushing-places overflowing with wine and oil.

<span id="an_2:25">2:25</span> I will give back to you the years which
were food for the locust, the plant-worm, the field-fly, and the worm,
my great army which I sent among you.

<span id="an_2:26">2:26</span> You will have food in full measure, and
give praise to the name of the Lord your God, who has done wonders for
you:

<span id="an_2:27">2:27</span> And you will be certain that I am in
Israel, and that I am the Lord your God, and there is no other: and my
people will never be shamed.

<span id="an_2:28">2:28</span> And after that, it will come about, says
the Lord, that I will send my spirit on all flesh; and your sons and
your daughters will be prophets, your old men will have dreams, your
young men will see visions:

<span id="an_2:29">2:29</span> And on the servants and the servant-girls
in those days I will send my spirit.

<span id="an_2:30">2:30</span> And I will let wonders be seen in the
heavens and on the earth, blood and fire and pillars of smoke.

<span id="an_2:31">2:31</span> The sun will be made dark and the moon
turned to blood, before the great day of the Lord comes, a day to be
feared.

<span id="an_2:32">2:32</span> And it will be that whoever makes his
prayer to the name of the Lord will be kept safe: for in Mount Zion and
in Jerusalem some will be kept safe, as the Lord has said, and will be
among the small band marked out by the Lord.

<span id="an_3:1">3:1</span> For in those days and in that time, when I
let the fate of Judah and Jerusalem be changed,

<span id="an_3:2">3:2</span> I will get together all the nations, and
make them come down into the valley of Jehoshaphat; and there I will
take up with them the cause of my people and of my heritage Israel, whom
they have sent wandering among the nations, and of my land which has
been parted by them.

<span id="an_3:3">3:3</span> And they have put the fate of my people to
the decision of chance: giving a boy for the price of a loose woman and
a girl for a drink of wine.

<span id="an_3:4">3:4</span> And further, what are you to me, O Tyre and
Zidon and all the circle of Philistia? will you give me back any
payment? and if you do, quickly and suddenly I will send it back on your
head,

<span id="an_3:5">3:5</span> For you have taken my silver and my gold,
putting in the houses of your gods my beautiful and pleasing things.

<span id="an_3:6">3:6</span> And the children of Judah and the children
of Jerusalem you have given for a price to the sons of the Greeks, to
send them far away from their land:

<span id="an_3:7">3:7</span> See, I will have them moved from the place
where you have sent them, and will let what you have done come back on
your head;

<span id="an_3:8">3:8</span> I will give your sons and your daughters
into the hands of the children of Judah for a price, and they will give
them for a price to the men of Sheba, a nation far off: for the Lord has
said it.

<span id="an_3:9">3:9</span> Give this out among the nations; make ready
for war: get the strong men awake; let all the men of war come near, let
them come up.

<span id="an_3:10">3:10</span> Get your plough-blades hammered into
swords, and your vine-knives into spears: let the feeble say, I am
strong.

<span id="an_3:11">3:11</span> Come quickly, all you nations round
about, and get yourselves together there: make your strong ones come
down, O Lord.

<span id="an_3:12">3:12</span> Let the nations be awake, and come to the
valley of Jehoshaphat: for there I will be seated as judge of all the
nations round about.

<span id="an_3:13">3:13</span> Put in the blade, for the grain is ready:
come, get you down, for the wine-crusher is full, the vessels are
overflowing; for great is their evil-doing.

<span id="an_3:14">3:14</span> Masses on masses in the valley of
decision! for the day of the Lord is near in the valley of decision.

<span id="an_3:15">3:15</span> The sun and the moon have become dark,
and the stars keep back their shining.

<span id="an_3:16">3:16</span> And the Lord will be thundering from
Zion, and his voice will be sounding from Jerusalem; and the heavens and
the earth will be shaking: but the Lord will be a breastplate for his
people and a strong place for the children of Israel.

<span id="an_3:17">3:17</span> And you will be certain that I am the
Lord your God, living in Zion, my holy mountain: and Jerusalem will be
holy, and no strange person will ever again go through her.

<span id="an_3:18">3:18</span> And it will come about in that day that
the mountains will be dropping sweet wine, and the hills will be flowing
with milk, and all the streams of Judah will be flowing with water; and
a fountain will come out from the house of the Lord, watering the valley
of acacia-trees.

<span id="an_3:19">3:19</span> Egypt will be a waste and Edom a land of
destruction, because of the evil done to the children of Judah, because
they have let blood be drained out in their land without cause.

<span id="an_3:20">3:20</span> But Judah will be peopled for ever, and
Jerusalem from generation to generation.

<span id="an_3:21">3:21</span> And I will send punishment for their
blood, for which punishment has not been sent, for the Lord is living in
Zion.
