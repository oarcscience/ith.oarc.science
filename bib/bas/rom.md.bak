### Basic English Bible: Romans

<span id="an_1:1">1:1</span> Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, an Apostle
by the selection of God, given authority as a preacher of the good news,

<span id="an_1:2">1:2</span> Of which God had given word before by his
prophets in the holy Writings,

<span id="an_1:3">1:3</span> About his Son who, in the flesh, came from
the family of David,

<span id="an_1:4">1:4</span> But was marked out as Son of God in power
by the Holy Spirit through the coming to life again of the dead; Jesus
Christ our Lord,

<span id="an_1:5">1:5</span> Through whom grace has been given to us,
sending us out to make disciples to the faith among all nations, for his
name:

<span id="an_1:6">1:6</span> Among whom you in the same way have been
marked out to be disciples of Jesus Christ:

<span id="an_1:7">1:7</span> To all those who are in Rome, loved by God,
marked out as saints: Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the
Lord Jesus Christ.

<span id="an_1:8">1:8</span> First of all, I give praise to my God
through Jesus Christ for you all, because news of your faith has gone
into all the world.

<span id="an_1:9">1:9</span> For God is my witness, whose servant I am
in spirit in the good news of his Son, that you are at all times in my
memory and in my prayers,

<span id="an_1:10">1:10</span> And that I am ever making prayers that
God will give me a good journey to you.

<span id="an_1:11">1:11</span> For I have a strong desire to see you,
and to give you some grace of the spirit, so that you may be made
strong;

<span id="an_1:12">1:12</span> That is to say, that all of us may be
comforted together by the faith which is in you and in me.

<span id="an_1:13">1:13</span> You may be certain, my brothers, that it
has frequently been in my mind to come to you (but till now I was kept
from it), so that I might have some fruit from you in the same way as I
have had it from the other nations.

<span id="an_1:14">1:14</span> I have a debt to Greeks and to the
nations outside; to the wise and to those who have no learning.

<span id="an_1:15">1:15</span> For which reason I have the desire, as
far as I am able, to give the knowledge of the good news to you who are
in Rome.

<span id="an_1:16">1:16</span> For I have no feeling of shame about the
good news, because it is the power of God giving salvation to everyone
who has faith, to the Jew first, and then to the Greek.

<span id="an_1:17">1:17</span> For in it there is the revelation of the
righteousness of God from faith to faith: as it is said in the holy
Writings, The man who does righteousness will be living by his faith.

<span id="an_1:18">1:18</span> For there is a revelation of the wrath of
God from heaven against all the wrongdoing and evil thoughts of men who
keep down what is true by wrongdoing;

<span id="an_1:19">1:19</span> Because the knowledge of God may be seen
in them, God having made it clear to them.

<span id="an_1:20">1:20</span> For from the first making of the world,
those things of God which the eye is unable to see, that is, his eternal
power and existence, are fully made clear, he having given the knowledge
of them through the things which he has made, so that men have no reason
for wrongdoing:

<span id="an_1:21">1:21</span> Because, having the knowledge of God,
they did not give glory to God as God, and did not give praise, but
their minds were full of foolish things, and their hearts, being without
sense, were made dark.

<span id="an_1:22">1:22</span> Seeming to be wise, they were in fact
foolish,

<span id="an_1:23">1:23</span> And by them the glory of the eternal God
was changed and made into the image of man who is not eternal, and of
birds and beasts and things which go on the earth.

<span id="an_1:24">1:24</span> For this reason God gave them up to the
evil desires of their hearts, working shame in their bodies with one
another:

<span id="an_1:25">1:25</span> Because by them the true word of God was
changed into that which is false, and they gave worship and honour to
the thing which is made, and not to him who made it, to whom be blessing
for ever. So be it.

<span id="an_1:26">1:26</span> For this reason God gave them up to evil
passions, and their women were changing the natural use into one which
is unnatural:

<span id="an_1:27">1:27</span> And in the same way the men gave up the
natural use of the woman and were burning in their desire for one
another, men doing shame with men, and getting in their bodies the right
reward of their evil-doing.

<span id="an_1:28">1:28</span> And because they had not the mind to keep
God in their knowledge, God gave them up to an evil mind, to do those
things which are not right;

<span id="an_1:29">1:29</span> Being full of all wrongdoing, evil,
desire for the goods of others, hate, envy, putting to death, fighting,
deceit, cruel ways, evil talk, and false statements about others;

<span id="an_1:30">1:30</span> Hated by God, full of pride, without
respect, full of loud talk, given to evil inventions, not honouring
father or mother,

<span id="an_1:31">1:31</span> Without knowledge, not true to their
undertakings, unkind, having no mercy:

<span id="an_1:32">1:32</span> Who, though they have knowledge of the
law of God, that the fate of those who do these things is death, not
only go on doing these things themselves, but give approval to those who
do them.

<span id="an_2:1">2:1</span> So you have no reason, whoever you are, for
judging: for in judging another you are judging yourself, for you do the
same things.

<span id="an_2:2">2:2</span> And we are conscious that God is a true
judge against those who do such things.

<span id="an_2:3">2:3</span> But you who are judging another for doing
what you do yourself, are you hoping that God's decision will not take
effect against you?

<span id="an_2:4">2:4</span> Or is it nothing to you that God had pity
on you, waiting and putting up with you for so long, not seeing that in
his pity God's desire is to give you a change of heart?

<span id="an_2:5">2:5</span> But by your hard and unchanged heart you
are storing up wrath for yourself in the day of the revelation of God's
judging in righteousness;

<span id="an_2:6">2:6</span> Who will give to every man his right
reward:

<span id="an_2:7">2:7</span> To those who go on with good works in the
hope of glory and honour and salvation from death, he will give eternal
life:

<span id="an_2:8">2:8</span> But to those who, from a love of
competition, are not guided by what is true, will come the heat of his
wrath,

<span id="an_2:9">2:9</span> Trouble and sorrow on all whose works are
evil, to the Jew first and then to the Greek;

<span id="an_2:10">2:10</span> But glory and honour and peace to all
whose works are good, to the Jew first and then to the Greek:

<span id="an_2:11">2:11</span> For one man is not different from another
before God.

<span id="an_2:12">2:12</span> All those who have done wrong without the
law will get destruction without the law: and those who have done wrong
under the law will have their punishment by the law;

<span id="an_2:13">2:13</span> For it is not the hearers of the law who
will be judged as having righteousness before God, but only the doers:

<span id="an_2:14">2:14</span> For when the Gentiles without the law
have a natural desire to do the things in the law, they are a law to
themselves;

<span id="an_2:15">2:15</span> Because the work of the law is seen in
their hearts, their sense of right and wrong giving witness to it, while
their minds are at one time judging them and at another giving them
approval;

<span id="an_2:16">2:16</span> In the day when God will be a judge of
the secrets of men, as it says in the good news of which I am a
preacher, through Jesus Christ.

<span id="an_2:17">2:17</span> But as for you who have the name of Jew,
and are resting on the law, and take pride in God,

<span id="an_2:18">2:18</span> And have knowledge of his desires, and
are a judge of the things which are different, having the learning of
the law,

<span id="an_2:19">2:19</span> In the belief that you are a guide to the
blind, a light to those in the dark,

<span id="an_2:20">2:20</span> A teacher of the foolish, having in the
law the form of knowledge and of what is true;

<span id="an_2:21">2:21</span> You who give teaching to others, do you
give it to yourself? you who say that a man may not take what is not
his, do you take what is not yours?

<span id="an_2:22">2:22</span> You who say that a man may not be untrue
to his wife, are you true to yours? you who are a hater of images, do
you do wrong to the house of God?

<span id="an_2:23">2:23</span> You who take pride in the law, are you
doing wrong to the honour of God by behaviour which is against the law?

<span id="an_2:24">2:24</span> For the name of God is shamed among the
Gentiles because of you, as it is said in the holy Writings.

<span id="an_2:25">2:25</span> It is true that circumcision is of use if
you keep the law, but if you go against the law it is as if you had it
not.

<span id="an_2:26">2:26</span> If those who have not circumcision keep
the rules of the law, will it not be credited to them as circumcision?

<span id="an_2:27">2:27</span> And they, by their keeping of the law
without circumcision, will be judges of you, by whom the law is broken
though you have the letter of the law and circumcision.

<span id="an_2:28">2:28</span> The true Jew is not one who is only so
publicly, and circumcision is not that which may be seen in the flesh:

<span id="an_2:29">2:29</span> But he is a Jew who is a secret one,
whose circumcision is of the heart, in the spirit and not in the letter;
whose praise is not from men, but from God.

<span id="an_3:1">3:1</span> How then is the Jew better off? or what
profit is there in circumcision?

<span id="an_3:2">3:2</span> Much in every way: first of all because the
words of God were given to them.

<span id="an_3:3">3:3</span> And if some have no faith, will that make
the faith of God without effect?

<span id="an_3:4">3:4</span> In no way: but let God be true, though
every man is seen to be untrue; as it is said in the Writings, That your
words may be seen to be true, and you may be seen to be right when you
are judged.

<span id="an_3:5">3:5</span> But if the righteousness of God is
supported by our wrongdoing what is to be said? is it wrong for God to
be angry (as men may say)?

<span id="an_3:6">3:6</span> In no way: because if it is so, how is God
able to be the judge of all the world?

<span id="an_3:7">3:7</span> But if, because I am untrue, God being seen
to be true gets more glory, why am I to be judged as a sinner?

<span id="an_3:8">3:8</span> Let us not do evil so that good may come (a
statement which we are falsely said by some to have made), because such
behaviour will have its right punishment.

<span id="an_3:9">3:9</span> What then? are we worse off than they? In
no way: because we have before made it clear that Jews as well as Greeks
are all under the power of sin;

<span id="an_3:10">3:10</span> As it is said in the holy Writings, There
is not one who does righteousness;

<span id="an_3:11">3:11</span> Not one who has the knowledge of what is
right, not one who is a searcher after God;

<span id="an_3:12">3:12</span> They have all gone out of the way, there
is no profit in any of them; there is not one who does good, not so much
as one:

<span id="an_3:13">3:13</span> Their throat is like an open place of
death; with their tongues they have said what is not true: the poison of
snakes is under their lips:

<span id="an_3:14">3:14</span> Whose mouth is full of curses and bitter
words:

<span id="an_3:15">3:15</span> Their feet are quick in running after
blood;

<span id="an_3:16">3:16</span> Destruction and trouble are in their
ways;

<span id="an_3:17">3:17</span> And of the way of peace they have no
knowledge:

<span id="an_3:18">3:18</span> There is no fear of God before their
eyes.

<span id="an_3:19">3:19</span> Now, we have knowledge that what the law
says is for those who are under the law, so that every mouth may be
stopped, and all men may be judged by God:

<span id="an_3:20">3:20</span> Because by the works of the law no man is
able to have righteousness in his eyes, for through the law comes the
knowledge of sin.

<span id="an_3:21">3:21</span> But now without the law there is a
revelation of the righteousness of God, to which witness is given by the
law and the prophets;

<span id="an_3:22">3:22</span> That is, the righteousness of God through
faith in Jesus Christ, to all those who have faith; and one man is not
different from another,

<span id="an_3:23">3:23</span> For all have done wrong and are far from
the glory of God;

<span id="an_3:24">3:24</span> And they may have righteousness put to
their credit, freely, by his grace, through the salvation which is in
Christ Jesus:

<span id="an_3:25">3:25</span> Whom God has put forward as the sign of
his mercy, through faith, by his blood, to make clear his righteousness
when, in his pity, God let the sins of earlier times go without
punishment;

<span id="an_3:26">3:26</span> And to make clear his righteousness now,
so that he might himself be upright, and give righteousness to him who
has faith in Jesus.

<span id="an_3:27">3:27</span> What reason, then, is there for pride? It
is shut out. By what sort of law? of works? No, but by a law of faith.

<span id="an_3:28">3:28</span> For this reason, then, a man may get
righteousness by faith without the works of the law.

<span id="an_3:29">3:29</span> Or is God the God of Jews only? is he not
in the same way the God of Gentiles? Yes, of Gentiles:

<span id="an_3:30">3:30</span> If God is one; and he will give
righteousness because of faith to those who have circumcision, and
through faith to those who have not circumcision.

<span id="an_3:31">3:31</span> Do we, then, through faith make the law
of no effect? in no way: but we make it clear that the law is important.

<span id="an_4:1">4:1</span> What, then, may we say that Abraham, our
father after the flesh, has got?

<span id="an_4:2">4:2</span> For if Abraham got righteousness by works,
he has reason for pride; but not before God.

<span id="an_4:3">4:3</span> But what does it say in the holy Writings?
And Abraham had faith in God, and it was put to his account as
righteousness.

<span id="an_4:4">4:4</span> Now, the reward is credited to him who does
works, not as of grace but as a debt.

<span id="an_4:5">4:5</span> But to him who without working has faith in
him who gives righteousness to the evil-doer, his faith is put to his
account as righteousness.

<span id="an_4:6">4:6</span> As David says that there is a blessing on
the man to whose account God puts righteousness without works, saying,

<span id="an_4:7">4:7</span> Happy are those who have forgiveness for
their wrongdoing, and whose sins are covered.

<span id="an_4:8">4:8</span> Happy is the man against whom no sin is
recorded by the Lord.

<span id="an_4:9">4:9</span> Is this blessing, then, for the
circumcision only, or in the same way for those who have not
circumcision? for we say that the faith of Abraham was put to his
account as righteousness.

<span id="an_4:10">4:10</span> How, then, was it judged? when he had
circumcision, or when he had it not? Not when he had it, but when he did
not have it:

<span id="an_4:11">4:11</span> And he was given the sign of circumcision
as a witness of the faith which he had before he underwent circumcision:
so that he might be the father of all those who have faith, though they
have not circumcision, and so that righteousness might be put to their
account;

<span id="an_4:12">4:12</span> And the father of circumcision to those
who not only are of the circumcision, but who keep to the way of that
faith which our father Abraham had before he underwent circumcision.

<span id="an_4:13">4:13</span> For God's word, that the earth would be
his heritage, was given to Abraham, not through the law, but through the
righteousness of faith.

<span id="an_4:14">4:14</span> For if they who are of the law are the
people who get the heritage, then faith is made of no use, and the word
of God has no power;

<span id="an_4:15">4:15</span> For the outcome of the law is wrath; but
where there is no law it will not be broken.

<span id="an_4:16">4:16</span> For this reason it is of faith, so that
it may be through grace; and so that the word of God may be certain to
all the seed; not only to that which is of the law, but to that which is
of the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all,

<span id="an_4:17">4:17</span> (As it is said in the holy Writings, I
have made you a father of a number of nations) before him in whom he had
faith, that is, God, who gives life to the dead, and to whom the things
which are not are as if they were.

<span id="an_4:18">4:18</span> Who without reason for hope, in faith
went on hoping, so that he became the father of a number of nations, as
it had been said, So will your seed be.

<span id="an_4:19">4:19</span> And not being feeble in faith though his
body seemed to him little better than dead (he being about a hundred
years old) and Sarah was no longer able to have children:

<span id="an_4:20">4:20</span> Still, he did not give up faith in the
undertaking of God, but was made strong by faith, giving glory to God,

<span id="an_4:21">4:21</span> And being certain that God was able to
keep his word.

<span id="an_4:22">4:22</span> For which reason it was put to his
account as righteousness.

<span id="an_4:23">4:23</span> Now, it was not because of him only that
this was said,

<span id="an_4:24">4:24</span> But for us in addition, to whose account
it will be put, if we have faith in him who made Jesus our Lord come
back again from the dead,

<span id="an_4:25">4:25</span> Who was put to death for our evil-doing,
and came to life again so that we might have righteousness.

<span id="an_5:1">5:1</span> For which reason, because we have
righteousness through faith, let us be at peace with God through our
Lord Jesus Christ;

<span id="an_5:2">5:2</span> Through whom, in the same way, we have been
able by faith to come to this grace in which we now are; and let us have
joy in hope of the glory of God.

<span id="an_5:3">5:3</span> And not only so, but let us have joy in our
troubles: in the knowledge that trouble gives us the power of waiting;

<span id="an_5:4">5:4</span> And waiting gives experience; and
experience, hope:

<span id="an_5:5">5:5</span> And hope does not put to shame; because our
hearts are full of the love of God through the Holy Spirit which is
given to us.

<span id="an_5:6">5:6</span> For when we were still without strength, at
the right time Christ gave his life for evil-doers.

<span id="an_5:7">5:7</span> Now it is hard for anyone to give his life
even for an upright man, though it might be that for a good man someone
would give his life.

<span id="an_5:8">5:8</span> But God has made clear his love to us, in
that, when we were still sinners, Christ gave his life for us.

<span id="an_5:9">5:9</span> Much more, if we now have righteousness by
his blood, will salvation from the wrath of God come to us through him.

<span id="an_5:10">5:10</span> For if, when we were haters of God, the
death of his Son made us at peace with him, much more, now that we are
his friends, will we have salvation through his life;

<span id="an_5:11">5:11</span> And not only so, but we have joy in God
through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we are now at peace with
God.

<span id="an_5:12">5:12</span> For this reason, as through one man sin
came into the world, and death because of sin, and so death came to all
men, because all have done evil:

<span id="an_5:13">5:13</span> Because, till the law came, sin was in
existence, but sin is not put to the account of anyone when there is no
law to be broken.

<span id="an_5:14">5:14</span> But still death had power from Adam till
Moses, even over those who had not done wrong like Adam, who is a
picture of him who was to come.

<span id="an_5:15">5:15</span> But the free giving of God is not like
the wrongdoing of man. For if, by the wrongdoing of one man death came
to numbers of men, much more did the grace of God, and the free giving
by the grace of one man, Jesus Christ, come to men.

<span id="an_5:16">5:16</span> And the free giving has not the same
effect as the sin of one: for the effect of one man's sin was punishment
by the decision of God, but the free giving had power to give
righteousness to wrongdoers in great number.

<span id="an_5:17">5:17</span> For, if by the wrongdoing of one, death
was ruling through the one, much more will those to whom has come the
wealth of grace and the giving of righteousness, be ruling in life
through the one, even Jesus Christ.

<span id="an_5:18">5:18</span> So then, as the effect of one act of
wrongdoing was that punishment came on all men, even so the effect of
one act of righteousness was righteousness of life for all men.

<span id="an_5:19">5:19</span> Because, as numbers of men became sinners
through the wrongdoing of one man, even so will great numbers get
righteousness through the keeping of the word of God by one man.

<span id="an_5:20">5:20</span> And the law came in addition, to make
wrongdoing worse; but where there was much sin, there was much more
grace:

<span id="an_5:21">5:21</span> That, as sin had power in death, so grace
might have power through righteousness to eternal life through Jesus
Christ our Lord.

<span id="an_6:1">6:1</span> What may we say, then? are we to go on in
sin so that there may be more grace?

<span id="an_6:2">6:2</span> In no way. How may we, who are dead to sin,
be living in it any longer?

<span id="an_6:3">6:3</span> Or are you without the knowledge that all
we who had baptism into Christ Jesus, had baptism into his death?

<span id="an_6:4">6:4</span> We have been placed with him among the dead
through baptism into death: so that as Christ came again from the dead
by the glory of the Father, we, in the same way, might be living in new
life.

<span id="an_6:5">6:5</span> For, if we have been made like him in his
death, we will, in the same way, be like him in his coming to life
again;

<span id="an_6:6">6:6</span> Being conscious that our old man was put to
death on the cross with him, so that the body of sin might be put away,
and we might no longer be servants to sin.

<span id="an_6:7">6:7</span> Because he who is dead is free from sin.

<span id="an_6:8">6:8</span> But if we are dead with Christ, we have
faith that we will be living with him;

<span id="an_6:9">6:9</span> Having knowledge that because Christ has
come back from the dead, he will never again go down to the dead; death
has no more power over him.

<span id="an_6:10">6:10</span> For his death was a death to sin, but his
life now is a life which he is living to God.

<span id="an_6:11">6:11</span> Even so see yourselves as dead to sin,
but living to God in Christ Jesus.

<span id="an_6:12">6:12</span> For this cause do not let sin be ruling
in your body which is under the power of death, so that you give way to
its desires;

<span id="an_6:13">6:13</span> And do not give your bodies to sin as the
instruments of wrongdoing, but give yourselves to God, as those who are
living from the dead, and your bodies as instruments of righteousness to
God.

<span id="an_6:14">6:14</span> For sin may not have rule over you:
because you are not under law, but under grace.

<span id="an_6:15">6:15</span> What then? are we to go on in sin because
we are not under law but under grace? Let it not be so.

<span id="an_6:16">6:16</span> Are you not conscious that you are the
servants of him to whom you give yourselves to do his desire? if to sin,
the end being death, or if to do the desire of God, the end being
righteousness.

<span id="an_6:17">6:17</span> But praise be to God that though you were
the servants of sin, you have now given yourselves freely to that form
of teaching under which you were placed;

<span id="an_6:18">6:18</span> And being made free from sin you have
been made the servants of righteousness.

<span id="an_6:19">6:19</span> I am using words in the way of men,
because your flesh is feeble: as you gave your bodies as servants to
what is unclean, and to evil to do evil, so now give them as servants to
righteousness to do what is holy.

<span id="an_6:20">6:20</span> When you were servants of sin you were
free from righteousness.

<span id="an_6:21">6:21</span> What fruit had you at that time in the
things which are now a shame to you? for the end of such things is
death.

<span id="an_6:22">6:22</span> But now, being free from sin, and having
been made servants to God, you have your fruit in that which is holy,
and the end is eternal life.

<span id="an_6:23">6:23</span> For the reward of sin is death; but what
God freely gives is eternal life in Jesus Christ our Lord.

<span id="an_7:1">7:1</span> Is it not clear, my brothers (I am using an
argument to those who have knowledge of the law), that the law has power
over a man as long as he is living?

<span id="an_7:2">7:2</span> For the woman who has a husband is placed
by the law under the power of her husband as long as he is living; but
if her husband is dead, she is free from the law of the husband.

<span id="an_7:3">7:3</span> So if, while the husband is living, she is
joined to another man, she will get the name of one who is untrue to her
husband: but if the husband is dead, she is free from the law, so that
she is not untrue, even if she takes another man.

<span id="an_7:4">7:4</span> In the same way, my brothers, you were made
dead to the law through the body of Christ, so that you might be joined
to another, even to him who came again from the dead, so that we might
give fruit to God.

<span id="an_7:5">7:5</span> For when we were in the flesh, the evil
passions which came into being through the law were working in our
bodies to give the fruit of death.

<span id="an_7:6">7:6</span> But now we are free from the law, having
been made dead to that which had power over us; so that we are servants
in the new way of the spirit, not in the old way of the letter.

<span id="an_7:7">7:7</span> What then is to be said? is the law sin? in
no way. But I would not have had knowledge of sin but for the law: for I
would not have been conscious of desire if the law had not said, You may
not have a desire for what is another's.

<span id="an_7:8">7:8</span> But sin, taking its chance through that
which was ordered by the law, was working in me every form of desire:
because without the law sin is dead.

<span id="an_7:9">7:9</span> And there was a time when I was living
without the law: but when the law gave its orders, sin came to life and
put me to death;

<span id="an_7:10">7:10</span> And I made the discovery that the law
whose purpose was to give life had become a cause of death:

<span id="an_7:11">7:11</span> For I was tricked and put to death by
sin, which took its chance through the law.

<span id="an_7:12">7:12</span> But the law is holy, and its orders are
holy, upright, and good.

<span id="an_7:13">7:13</span> Was then that which is good, death to me?
In no way. But the purpose was that sin might be seen to be sin by
working death to me through that which is good; so that through the
orders of the law sin might seem much more evil.

<span id="an_7:14">7:14</span> For we are conscious that the law is of
the spirit; but I am of the flesh, given into the power of sin.

<span id="an_7:15">7:15</span> And I have no clear knowledge of what I
am doing, for that which I have a mind to do, I do not, but what I have
hate for, that I do.

<span id="an_7:16">7:16</span> But, if I do that which I have no mind to
do, I am in agreement with the law that the law is good.

<span id="an_7:17">7:17</span> So it is no longer I who do it, but the
sin living in me.

<span id="an_7:18">7:18</span> For I am conscious that in me, that is,
in my flesh, there is nothing good: I have the mind but not the power to
do what is right.

<span id="an_7:19">7:19</span> For the good which I have a mind to do, I
do not: but the evil which I have no mind to do, that I do.

<span id="an_7:20">7:20</span> But if I do what I have no mind to do, it
is no longer I who do it, but the sin living in me.

<span id="an_7:21">7:21</span> So I see a law that, though I have a mind
to do good, evil is present in me.

<span id="an_7:22">7:22</span> In my heart I take pleasure in the law of
God,

<span id="an_7:23">7:23</span> But I see another law in my body, working
against the law of my mind, and making me the servant of the law of sin
which is in my flesh.

<span id="an_7:24">7:24</span> How unhappy am I! who will make me free
from the body of this death?

<span id="an_7:25">7:25</span> I give praise to God through Jesus Christ
our Lord. So with my mind I am a servant to the law of God, but with my
flesh to the law of sin.

<span id="an_8:1">8:1</span> For this cause those who are in Christ
Jesus will not be judged as sinners.

<span id="an_8:2">8:2</span> For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ
Jesus has made me free from the law of sin and death.

<span id="an_8:3">8:3</span> For what the law was not able to do because
it was feeble through the flesh, God, sending his Son in the image of
the evil flesh, and as an offering for sin, gave his decision against
sin in the flesh:

<span id="an_8:4">8:4</span> So that what was ordered by the law might
be done in us, who are living, not in the way of the flesh, but in the
way of the Spirit.

<span id="an_8:5">8:5</span> For those who are living in the way of the
flesh give their minds to the things of the flesh, but those who go in
the way of the Spirit, to the things of the Spirit.

<span id="an_8:6">8:6</span> For the mind of the flesh is death, but the
mind of the Spirit is life and peace:

<span id="an_8:7">8:7</span> Because the mind of the flesh is opposite
to God; it is not under the law of God, and is not able to be:

<span id="an_8:8">8:8</span> So that those who are in the flesh are not
able to give pleasure to God.

<span id="an_8:9">8:9</span> You are not in the flesh but in the Spirit,
if the Spirit of God is in you. But if any man has not the Spirit of
Christ he is not one of his.

<span id="an_8:10">8:10</span> And if Christ is in you, the body is dead
because of sin, but the Spirit is life because of righteousness.

<span id="an_8:11">8:11</span> But if the Spirit of him who made Jesus
come again from the dead is in you, he who made Christ Jesus come again
from the dead will in the same way, through his Spirit which is in you,
give life to your bodies which now are under the power of death.

<span id="an_8:12">8:12</span> So then, my brothers, we are in debt, not
to the flesh to be living in the way of the flesh:

<span id="an_8:13">8:13</span> For if you go in the way of the flesh,
death will come on you; but if by the Spirit you put to death the works
of the body, you will have life.

<span id="an_8:14">8:14</span> And all those who are guided by the
Spirit of God are sons of God.

<span id="an_8:15">8:15</span> For you did not get the spirit of
servants again to put you in fear, but the spirit of sons was given to
you, by which we say, Abba, Father.

<span id="an_8:16">8:16</span> The Spirit is witness with our spirit
that we are children of God:

<span id="an_8:17">8:17</span> And if we are children, we have a right
to a part in the heritage; a part in the things of God, together with
Christ; so that if we have a part in his pain, we will in the same way
have a part in his glory.

<span id="an_8:18">8:18</span> I am of the opinion that there is no
comparison between the pain of this present time and the glory which we
will see in the future.

<span id="an_8:19">8:19</span> For the strong desire of every living
thing is waiting for the revelation of the sons of God.

<span id="an_8:20">8:20</span> For every living thing was put under the
power of change, not by its desire, but by him who made it so, in hope

<span id="an_8:21">8:21</span> That all living things will be made free
from the power of death and will have a part with the free children of
God in glory.

<span id="an_8:22">8:22</span> For we are conscious that all living
things are weeping and sorrowing in pain together till now.

<span id="an_8:23">8:23</span> And not only so, but we who have the
first fruits of the Spirit, even we have sorrow in our minds, waiting
for the time when we will take our place as sons, that is, the salvation
of our bodies.

<span id="an_8:24">8:24</span> For our salvation is by hope: but hope
which is seen is not hope: for who is hoping for what he sees?

<span id="an_8:25">8:25</span> But if we have hope for that which we see
not, then we will be able to go on waiting for it.

<span id="an_8:26">8:26</span> And in the same way the Spirit is a help
to our feeble hearts: for we are not able to make prayer to God in the
right way; but the Spirit puts our desires into words which are not in
our power to say;

<span id="an_8:27">8:27</span> And he who is the searcher of hearts has
knowledge of the mind of the Spirit, because he is making prayers for
the saints in agreement with the mind of God.

<span id="an_8:28">8:28</span> And we are conscious that all things are
working together for good to those who have love for God, and have been
marked out by his purpose.

<span id="an_8:29">8:29</span> Because those of whom he had knowledge
before they came into existence, were marked out by him to be made like
his Son, so that he might be the first among a band of brothers:

<span id="an_8:30">8:30</span> And those who were marked out by him were
named; and those who were named were given righteousness; and to those
to whom he gave righteousness, in the same way he gave glory.

<span id="an_8:31">8:31</span> What may we say about these things? If
God is for us, who is against us?

<span id="an_8:32">8:32</span> He who did not keep back his only Son,
but gave him up for us all, will he not with him freely give us all
things?

<span id="an_8:33">8:33</span> Who will say anything against the saints
of God? It is God who makes us clear from evil;

<span id="an_8:34">8:34</span> Who will give a decision against us? It
is Christ Jesus who not only was put to death, but came again from the
dead, who is now at the right hand of God, taking our part.

<span id="an_8:35">8:35</span> Who will come between us and the love of
Christ? Will trouble, or pain, or cruel acts, or the need of food or of
clothing, or danger, or the sword?

<span id="an_8:36">8:36</span> As it is said in the holy Writings,
Because of you we are put to death every day; we are like sheep ready
for destruction.

<span id="an_8:37">8:37</span> But we are able to overcome all these
things and more through his love.

<span id="an_8:38">8:38</span> For I am certain that not death, or life,
or angels, or rulers, or things present, or things to come, or powers,

<span id="an_8:39">8:39</span> Or things on high, or things under the
earth, or anything which is made, will be able to come between us and
the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.

<span id="an_9:1">9:1</span> I say what is true in Christ, and not what
is false, my mind giving witness with me in the Holy Spirit,

<span id="an_9:2">9:2</span> That I am full of sorrow and pain without
end.

<span id="an_9:3">9:3</span> For I have a desire to take on myself the
curse for my brothers, my family in the flesh:

<span id="an_9:4">9:4</span> Who are Israelites: who have the place of
sons, and the glory, and the agreements with God, and the giving of the
law, and the worship, and the hope offered by God:

<span id="an_9:5">9:5</span> Whose are the fathers, and of whom came
Christ in the flesh, who is over all, God, to whom be blessing for ever.
So be it.

<span id="an_9:6">9:6</span> But it is not as if the word of God was
without effect. For they are not all Israel, who are of Israel:

<span id="an_9:7">9:7</span> And they are not all children because they
are the seed of Abraham; but, In Isaac will your seed be named.

<span id="an_9:8">9:8</span> That is, it is not the children of the
flesh, but the children of God's undertaking, who are named as the seed.

<span id="an_9:9">9:9</span> For this is the word of God's undertaking,
At this time will I come, and Sarah will have a son.

<span id="an_9:10">9:10</span> And not only so, but Rebecca being about
to have a child by our father Isaac--

<span id="an_9:11">9:11</span> Before the children had come into
existence, or had done anything good or bad, in order that God's purpose
and his selection might be effected, not by works, but by him whose
purpose it is,

<span id="an_9:12">9:12</span> It was said to her, The older will be the
servant of the younger.

<span id="an_9:13">9:13</span> Even as it is said, I had love for Jacob,
but for Esau I had hate.

<span id="an_9:14">9:14</span> What may we say then? is God not upright?
let it not be said.

<span id="an_9:15">9:15</span> For he says to Moses, I will have mercy
on whom I will have mercy, and pity on whom I will have pity.

<span id="an_9:16">9:16</span> So then, it is not by the desire or by
the attempt of man, but by the mercy of God.

<span id="an_9:17">9:17</span> For the holy Writings say to Pharaoh, For
this same purpose did I put you on high, so that I might make my power
seen in you, and that there might be knowledge of my name through all
the earth.

<span id="an_9:18">9:18</span> So then, at his pleasure he has mercy on
a man, and at his pleasure he makes the heart hard.

<span id="an_9:19">9:19</span> But you will say to me, Why does he still
make us responsible? who is able to go against his purpose?

<span id="an_9:20">9:20</span> But, O man, who are you, to make answer
against God? May the thing which is made say to him who made it, Why did
you make me so?

<span id="an_9:21">9:21</span> Or has not the potter the right to make
out of one part of his earth a vessel for honour, and out of another a
vessel for shame?

<span id="an_9:22">9:22</span> What if God, desiring to let his wrath
and his power be seen, for a long time put up with the vessels of wrath
which were ready for destruction:

<span id="an_9:23">9:23</span> And to make clear the wealth of his glory
to vessels of mercy, which he had before made ready for glory,

<span id="an_9:24">9:24</span> Even us, who were marked out by him, not
only from the Jews, but from the Gentiles?

<span id="an_9:25">9:25</span> As he says in Hosea, They will be named
my people who were not my people, and she will be loved who was not
loved.

<span id="an_9:26">9:26</span> And in the place where it was said to
them, You are not my people, there they will be named the sons of the
living God.

<span id="an_9:27">9:27</span> And Isaiah says about Israel, Even if the
number of the children of Israel is as the sand of the sea, only a small
part will get salvation:

<span id="an_9:28">9:28</span> For the Lord will give effect to his word
on the earth, putting an end to it and cutting it short.

<span id="an_9:29">9:29</span> And, as Isaiah had said before, If the
Lord of armies had not given us a seed, we would have been like Sodom
and Gomorrah.

<span id="an_9:30">9:30</span> What then may we say? That the nations
who did not go after righteousness have got righteousness, even the
righteousness which is of faith:

<span id="an_9:31">9:31</span> But Israel, going after a law of
righteousness, did not get it.

<span id="an_9:32">9:32</span> Why? Because they were not searching for
it by faith, but by works. They came up against the stone which was in
the way;

<span id="an_9:33">9:33</span> As it is said, See, I am putting in Zion
a stone causing a fall, and a rock in the way: but he who has faith in
him will not be put to shame.

<span id="an_10:1">10:1</span> Brothers, my heart's desire and my prayer
to God for them is, that they may get salvation.

<span id="an_10:2">10:2</span> For I give witness of them that they have
a strong desire for God, but not with knowledge.

<span id="an_10:3">10:3</span> Because, not having knowledge of God's
righteousness, and desiring to give effect to their righteousness, they
have not put themselves under the righteousness of God.

<span id="an_10:4">10:4</span> For Christ is the end of the law for
righteousness to everyone who has faith.

<span id="an_10:5">10:5</span> For Moses says that the man who does the
righteousness which is of the law will get life by it.

<span id="an_10:6">10:6</span> But the righteousness which is of faith
says these words, Say not in your heart, Who will go up to heaven? (that
is, to make Christ come down:)

<span id="an_10:7">10:7</span> Or, Who will go down into the deep? (that
is, to make Christ come again from the dead:)

<span id="an_10:8">10:8</span> But what does it say? The word is near
you, in your mouth and in your heart: that is, the word of faith of
which we are the preachers:

<span id="an_10:9">10:9</span> Because, if you say with your mouth that
Jesus is Lord, and have faith in your heart that God has made him come
back from the dead, you will have salvation:

<span id="an_10:10">10:10</span> For with the heart man has faith to get
righteousness, and with the mouth he says that Jesus is Lord to get
salvation.

<span id="an_10:11">10:11</span> Because it is said in the holy
Writings, Whoever has faith in him will not be shamed.

<span id="an_10:12">10:12</span> And the Jew is not different from the
Greek: for there is the same Lord of all, who is good to all who have
hope in his name:

<span id="an_10:13">10:13</span> Because, Whoever will give worship to
the name of the Lord will get salvation.

<span id="an_10:14">10:14</span> But how will they give worship to him
in whom they have no faith? and how will they have faith in him of whom
they have not had news? and how will they have news without a preacher?

<span id="an_10:15">10:15</span> And how will there be preachers if they
are not sent? As it is said, How beautiful are the feet of those who
give the glad news of good things.

<span id="an_10:16">10:16</span> But they have not all given ear to the
good news. For Isaiah says, Lord, who has had faith in our word?

<span id="an_10:17">10:17</span> So faith comes by hearing, and hearing
by the word of Christ.

<span id="an_10:18">10:18</span> But I say, Did not the word come to
their ears? Yes, certainly: Their sound has gone out into all the earth,
and their words to the ends of the world.

<span id="an_10:19">10:19</span> But I say, Had Israel no knowledge?
First Moses says, You will be moved to envy by that which is not a
nation, and by a foolish people I will make you angry.

<span id="an_10:20">10:20</span> And Isaiah says without fear, Those who
were not searching for me made discovery of me; and I was seen by those
whose hearts were turned away from me.

<span id="an_10:21">10:21</span> But about Israel he says; All the day
my hands have been stretched out to a people whose hearts were turned
away, and who put themselves against my word.

<span id="an_11:1">11:1</span> So I say, Has God put his people on one
side? Let there be no such thought. For I am of Israel, of the seed of
Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin.

<span id="an_11:2">11:2</span> God has not put away the people of his
selection. Or have you no knowledge of what is said about Elijah in the
holy Writings? how he says words to God against Israel,

<span id="an_11:3">11:3</span> Lord, they have put your prophets to
death, and made waste your altars, and now I am the last, and they are
searching for me to take away my life.

<span id="an_11:4">11:4</span> But what answer does God make to him? I
have still seven thousand men whose knees have not been bent to Baal.

<span id="an_11:5">11:5</span> In the same way, there are at this
present time some who are marked out by the selection of grace.

<span id="an_11:6">11:6</span> But if it is of grace, then it is no
longer of works: or grace would not be grace.

<span id="an_11:7">11:7</span> What then? That which Israel was
searching for he did not get, but those of the selection got it and the
rest were made hard.

<span id="an_11:8">11:8</span> As it was said in the holy Writings, God
gave them a spirit of sleep, eyes which might not see, and ears which
have no hearing, to this day.

<span id="an_11:9">11:9</span> And David says, Let their table be made a
net for taking them, and a stone in their way, and a punishment:

<span id="an_11:10">11:10</span> Let their eyes be made dark so that
they may not see, and let their back be bent down at all times.

<span id="an_11:11">11:11</span> So I say, Were their steps made hard in
order that they might have a fall? In no way: but by their fall
salvation has come to the Gentiles, so that they might be moved to envy.

<span id="an_11:12">11:12</span> Now, if their fall is the wealth of the
world, and their loss the wealth of the Gentiles, how much greater will
be the glory when they are made full?

<span id="an_11:13">11:13</span> But I say to you, Gentiles, in so far
as I am the Apostle of the Gentiles, I make much of my position:

<span id="an_11:14">11:14</span> If in any way those who are of my flesh
may be moved to envy, so that some of them may get salvation by me.

<span id="an_11:15">11:15</span> For, if by their putting away, the rest
of men have been made friends with God, what will their coming back
again be, but life from the dead?

<span id="an_11:16">11:16</span> And if the first-fruit is holy, so is
the mass: and if the root is holy, so are the branches.

<span id="an_11:17">11:17</span> But if some of the branches were broken
off, and you, an olive-tree of the fields, were put in among them, and
were given a part with them in the root by which the olive-tree is made
fertile,

<span id="an_11:18">11:18</span> Do not be uplifted in pride over the
branches: because it is not you who are the support of the root, but it
is by the root that you are supported.

<span id="an_11:19">11:19</span> You will say, Branches were broken off
so that I might be put in.

<span id="an_11:20">11:20</span> Truly, because they had no faith they
were broken off, and you have your place by reason of your faith. Do not
be lifted up in pride, but have fear;

<span id="an_11:21">11:21</span> For, if God did not have mercy on the
natural branches, he will not have mercy on you.

<span id="an_11:22">11:22</span> See then that God is good but his rules
are fixed: to those who were put away he was hard, but to you he has
been good, on the condition that you keep in his mercy; if not, you will
be cut off as they were.

<span id="an_11:23">11:23</span> And they, if they do not go on without
faith, will be united to the tree again, because God is able to put them
in again.

<span id="an_11:24">11:24</span> For if you were cut out of a field
olive-tree, and against the natural use were united to a good
olive-tree, how much more will these, the natural branches, be united
again with the olive-tree which was theirs?

<span id="an_11:25">11:25</span> For it is my desire, brothers, that
this secret may be clear to you, so that you may not have pride in your
knowledge, that Israel has been made hard in part, till all the Gentiles
have come in;

<span id="an_11:26">11:26</span> And so all Israel will get salvation:
as it is said in the holy Writings, There will come out of Zion the One
who makes free; by him wrongdoing will be taken away from Jacob:

<span id="an_11:27">11:27</span> And this is my agreement with them,
when I will take away their sins.

<span id="an_11:28">11:28</span> As far as the good news is in question,
they are cut off from God on account of you, but as far as the selection
is in question, they are loved on account of the fathers.

<span id="an_11:29">11:29</span> Because God's selection and his mercies
may not be changed.

<span id="an_11:30">11:30</span> For as you, in time past, were not
under the rule of God, but now have got mercy through their turning
away,

<span id="an_11:31">11:31</span> So in the same way these have gone
against the orders of God, so that by the mercy given to you they may
now get mercy.

<span id="an_11:32">11:32</span> For God has let them all go against his
orders, so that he might have mercy on them all.

<span id="an_11:33">11:33</span> O how deep is the wealth of the wisdom
and knowledge of God! no one is able to make discovery of his decisions,
and his ways may not be searched out.

<span id="an_11:34">11:34</span> Who has knowledge of the mind of the
Lord? or who has taken part in his purposes?

<span id="an_11:35">11:35</span> Or who has first given to him, and it
will be given back to him again?

<span id="an_11:36">11:36</span> For of him, and through him, and to
him, are all things. To him be the glory for ever. So be it.

<span id="an_12:1">12:1</span> For this reason I make request to you,
brothers, by the mercies of God, that you will give your bodies as a
living offering, holy, pleasing to God, which is the worship it is right
for you to give him.

<span id="an_12:2">12:2</span> And let not your behaviour be like that
of this world, but be changed and made new in mind, so that by
experience you may have knowledge of the good and pleasing and complete
purpose of God.

<span id="an_12:3">12:3</span> But I say to every one of you, through
the grace given to me, not to have an over-high opinion of himself, but
to have wise thoughts, as God has given to every one a measure of faith.

<span id="an_12:4">12:4</span> For, as we have a number of parts in one
body, but all the parts have not the same use,

<span id="an_12:5">12:5</span> So we, though we are a number of persons,
are one body in Christ, and are dependent on one another;

<span id="an_12:6">12:6</span> And having different qualities by reason
of the grace given to us, such as the quality of a prophet, let it be
made use of in relation to the measure of our faith;

<span id="an_12:7">12:7</span> Or the position of a Deacon of the
church, let a man give himself to it; or he who has the power of
teaching, let him make use of it;

<span id="an_12:8">12:8</span> He who has the power of comforting, let
him do so; he who gives, let him give freely; he who has the power of
ruling, let him do it with a serious mind; he who has mercy on others,
let it be with joy.

<span id="an_12:9">12:9</span> Let love be without deceit. Be haters of
what is evil; keep your minds fixed on what is good.

<span id="an_12:10">12:10</span> Be kind to one another with a brother's
love, putting others before yourselves in honour;

<span id="an_12:11">12:11</span> Be not slow in your work, but be quick
in spirit, as the Lord's servants;

<span id="an_12:12">12:12</span> Being glad in hope, quiet in trouble,
at all times given to prayer,

<span id="an_12:13">12:13</span> Giving to the needs of the saints,
ready to take people into your houses.

<span id="an_12:14">12:14</span> Give blessing and not curses to those
who are cruel to you.

<span id="an_12:15">12:15</span> Take part in the joy of those who are
glad, and in the grief of those who are sorrowing.

<span id="an_12:16">12:16</span> Be in harmony with one another. Do not
have a high opinion of yourselves, but be in agreement with common
people. Do not give yourselves an air of wisdom.

<span id="an_12:17">12:17</span> Do not give evil for evil to any man.
Let all your business be well ordered in the eyes of all men.

<span id="an_12:18">12:18</span> As far as it is possible for you be at
peace with all men.

<span id="an_12:19">12:19</span> Do not give punishment for wrongs done
to you, dear brothers, but give way to the wrath of God; for it is said
in the holy Writings, Punishment is mine, I will give reward, says the
Lord.

<span id="an_12:20">12:20</span> But if one who has hate for you is in
need of food or of drink, give it to him, for in so doing you will put
coals of fire on his head.

<span id="an_12:21">12:21</span> Do not let evil overcome you, but
overcome evil by good.

<span id="an_13:1">13:1</span> Let everyone put himself under the
authority of the higher powers, because there is no power which is not
of God, and all powers are ordered by God.

<span id="an_13:2">13:2</span> For which reason everyone who puts
himself against the authority puts himself against the order of God: and
those who are against it will get punishment for themselves.

<span id="an_13:3">13:3</span> For rulers are not a cause of fear to the
good work but to the evil. If you would have no fear of the authority,
do good and you will have praise;

<span id="an_13:4">13:4</span> For he is the servant of God to you for
good. But if you do evil, have fear; for the sword is not in his hand
for nothing: he is God's servant, making God's punishment come on the
evil-doer.

<span id="an_13:5">13:5</span> So put yourselves under the authority,
not for fear of wrath, but because you have the knowledge of what is
right.

<span id="an_13:6">13:6</span> For the same reason, make payment of
taxes; because the authority is God's servant, to take care of such
things at all times.

<span id="an_13:7">13:7</span> Give to all what is their right: taxes to
him whose they are, payment to him whose right it is, fear to whom fear,
honour to whom honour is to be given.

<span id="an_13:8">13:8</span> Be in debt for nothing, but to have love
for one another: for he who has love for his neighbour has kept all the
law.

<span id="an_13:9">13:9</span> And this, Do not be untrue in married
life, Do not put to death, Do not take what is another's, Do not have
desire for what is another's, and if there is any other order, it is
covered by this word, Have love for your neighbour as for yourself.

<span id="an_13:10">13:10</span> Love does no wrong to his neighbour, so
love makes the law complete.

<span id="an_13:11">13:11</span> See then that the time has come for you
to be awake from sleep: for now is your salvation nearer than when you
first had faith.

<span id="an_13:12">13:12</span> The night is far gone, and the day is
near: so let us put off the works of the dark, arming ourselves with
light,

<span id="an_13:13">13:13</span> With right behaviour as in the day; not
in pleasure-making and drinking, not in bad company and unclean
behaviour, not in fighting and envy.

<span id="an_13:14">13:14</span> But put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and
do not give thought to the flesh to do its desires.

<span id="an_14:1">14:1</span> Do not put on one side him who is feeble
in faith, and do not put him in doubt by your reasonings.

<span id="an_14:2">14:2</span> One man has faith to take all things as
food: another who is feeble in faith takes only green food.

<span id="an_14:3">14:3</span> Let not him who takes food have a low
opinion of him who does not: and let not him who does not take food be a
judge of him who does; for he has God's approval.

<span id="an_14:4">14:4</span> Who are you to make yourself a judge of
another man's servant? it is to his master that he is responsible for
good or bad. Yes, his place will be safe, because the Lord is able to
keep him from falling.

<span id="an_14:5">14:5</span> This man puts one day before another: to
that man they are the same. Let every man be certain in his mind.

<span id="an_14:6">14:6</span> He who keeps the day, keeps it to the
Lord; and he who takes food, takes it as to the Lord, for he gives
praise to God; and he who does not take food, to the Lord he takes it
not, and gives praise to God.

<span id="an_14:7">14:7</span> For every man's life and every man's
death has a relation to others as well as to himself.

<span id="an_14:8">14:8</span> As long as we have life we are living to
the Lord; or if we give up our life it is to the Lord; so if we are
living, or if our life comes to an end, we are the Lord's.

<span id="an_14:9">14:9</span> And for this purpose Christ went into
death and came back again, that he might be the Lord of the dead and of
the living.

<span id="an_14:10">14:10</span> But you, why do you make yourself your
brother's judge? or again, why have you no respect for your brother?
because we will all have to take our place before God as our judge.

<span id="an_14:11">14:11</span> For it is said in the holy Writings, By
my life, says the Lord, to me every knee will be bent, and every tongue
will give worship to God.

<span id="an_14:12">14:12</span> So every one of us will have to give an
account of himself to God.

<span id="an_14:13">14:13</span> Then let us not be judges of one
another any longer: but keep this in mind, that no man is to make it
hard for his brother, or give him cause for doubting.

<span id="an_14:14">14:14</span> I am conscious of this, and am certain
in the Lord Jesus, that nothing is unclean in itself; but for the man in
whose opinion it is unclean, for him it is unclean.

<span id="an_14:15">14:15</span> And if because of food your brother is
troubled, then you are no longer going on in the way of love. Do not let
your food be destruction to him for whom Christ went into death.

<span id="an_14:16">14:16</span> Let it not be possible for men to say
evil about your good:

<span id="an_14:17">14:17</span> For the kingdom of God is not food and
drink, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit.

<span id="an_14:18">14:18</span> And he who in these things is Christ's
servant, is pleasing to God and has the approval of men.

<span id="an_14:19">14:19</span> So then, let us go after the things
which make peace, and the things by which we may be a help to one
another.

<span id="an_14:20">14:20</span> Do not let the work of God come to
nothing on account of food. All things are certainly clean; but it is
evil for that man who by taking food makes it hard for another.

<span id="an_14:21">14:21</span> It is better not to take meat or wine
or to do anything which might be a cause of trouble to your brother.

<span id="an_14:22">14:22</span> The faith which you have, have it to
yourself before God. Happy is the man who is not judged by that to which
he gives approval.

<span id="an_14:23">14:23</span> But he who is in doubt is judged if he
takes food, because he does it not in faith; and whatever is not of
faith is sin.

<span id="an_15:1">15:1</span> We who are strong have to be a support to
the feeble, and not give pleasure to ourselves.

<span id="an_15:2">15:2</span> Let every one of us give pleasure to his
neighbour for his good, to make him strong.

<span id="an_15:3">15:3</span> For Christ did not give pleasure to
himself, but, as it is said, The bitter words of those who were angry
with you came on me.

<span id="an_15:4">15:4</span> Now those things which were put down in
writing before our time were for our learning, so that through quiet
waiting and through the comfort of the holy Writings we might have hope.

<span id="an_15:5">15:5</span> Now may the God who gives comfort and
strength in waiting make you of the same mind with one another in
harmony with Christ Jesus:

<span id="an_15:6">15:6</span> So that with one mouth you may give glory
to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.

<span id="an_15:7">15:7</span> So then, take one another to your hearts,
as Christ took us, to the glory of God.

<span id="an_15:8">15:8</span> Now I say that Christ has been made a
servant of the circumcision to give effect to the undertakings given by
God to the fathers,

<span id="an_15:9">15:9</span> And so that the Gentiles might give glory
to God for his mercy; as it is said, For this reason I will give praise
to you among the Gentiles, and I will make a song to your name.

<span id="an_15:10">15:10</span> And again he says, Take part, you
Gentiles, in the joy of his people.

<span id="an_15:11">15:11</span> And again, Give praise to the Lord, all
you Gentiles; and let all the nations give praise to him.

<span id="an_15:12">15:12</span> And again Isaiah says, There will be
the root of Jesse, and he who comes to be the ruler over the Gentiles;
in him will the Gentiles put their hope.

<span id="an_15:13">15:13</span> Now may the God of hope make you full
of joy and peace through faith, so that all hope may be yours in the
power of the Holy Spirit.

<span id="an_15:14">15:14</span> And I myself am certain of you,
brothers, that you are full of what is good, complete in all knowledge,
able to give direction to one another.

<span id="an_15:15">15:15</span> But I have, in some measure, less fear
in writing to you to put these things before you again, because of the
grace which was given to me by God,

<span id="an_15:16">15:16</span> To be a servant of Christ Jesus to the
Gentiles, doing the work of a priest in the good news of God, so that
the offering of the Gentiles might be pleasing to God, being made holy
by the Holy Spirit.

<span id="an_15:17">15:17</span> So I have pride in Christ Jesus in the
things which are God's.

<span id="an_15:18">15:18</span> And I will keep myself from talking of
anything but those things which Christ has done by me to put the
Gentiles under his rule in word and in act,

<span id="an_15:19">15:19</span> By signs and wonders, in the power of
the Holy Spirit; so that from Jerusalem and round about as far as
Illyricum I have given all the good news of Christ;

<span id="an_15:20">15:20</span> Making it my purpose not to take the
good news where Christ was named, so that my work might not be resting
on that of others;

<span id="an_15:21">15:21</span> But as it is said in the holy Writings,
They will see, to whom the news of him had not been given, and those to
whose ears it had not come will have knowledge.

<span id="an_15:22">15:22</span> For which reason I was frequently kept
from coming to you:

<span id="an_15:23">15:23</span> But now, having no longer any place in
these parts and having had for a number of years a great desire to come
to you,

<span id="an_15:24">15:24</span> Whenever I go to Spain (for it is my
hope to see you on my way, and to be sent on there by you, if first I
may in some measure have been comforted by your company)--

<span id="an_15:25">15:25</span> But now I go to Jerusalem, taking help
for the saints.

<span id="an_15:26">15:26</span> For it has been the good pleasure of
those of Macedonia and Achaia to send a certain amount of money for the
poor among the saints at Jerusalem.

<span id="an_15:27">15:27</span> Yes, it has been their good pleasure;
and they are in their debt. For if the Gentiles have had a part in the
things of the Spirit which were theirs, it is right for them, in the
same way, to give them help in the things of the flesh.

<span id="an_15:28">15:28</span> So when I have done this, and have
given them this fruit of love, I will go on by you into Spain.

<span id="an_15:29">15:29</span> And I am certain that when I come, I
will be full of the blessing of Christ.

<span id="an_15:30">15:30</span> Now I make request to you, brothers, by
our Lord Jesus Christ, and by the love of the Spirit, that you will be
working together with me in your prayers to God for me;

<span id="an_15:31">15:31</span> So that I may be kept safe from those
in Judaea who have not put themselves under the rule of God, and that
the help which I am taking for Jerusalem may be pleasing to the saints;

<span id="an_15:32">15:32</span> So that I may come to you in joy by the
good pleasure of God, and have rest with you.

<span id="an_15:33">15:33</span> Now may the God of peace be with you
all. So be it.

<span id="an_16:1">16:1</span> It is my desire to say a good word for
Phoebe, who is a servant of the church in Cenchreae:

<span id="an_16:2">16:2</span> That you will take her in kindly, after
the way of the saints, as one who is the Lord's, and give her help in
anything in which she may have need of you: because she has been a help
to a great number and to myself.

<span id="an_16:3">16:3</span> Give my love to Prisca and Aquila,
workers with me in Christ Jesus,

<span id="an_16:4">16:4</span> Who for my life put their necks in
danger; to whom not only I but all the churches of the Gentiles are in
debt:

<span id="an_16:5">16:5</span> And say a kind word to the church which
is in their house. Give my love to my dear Epaenetus, who is the first
fruit of Asia to Christ.

<span id="an_16:6">16:6</span> Give my love to Mary, who gave much care
to you.

<span id="an_16:7">16:7</span> Give my love to Andronicus and Junia, my
relations, who were in prison with me, who are noted among the Apostles,
and who were in Christ before me.

<span id="an_16:8">16:8</span> Give my love to Ampliatus, who is dear to
me in the Lord,

<span id="an_16:9">16:9</span> Give my love to Urbanus, a worker in
Christ with us, and to my dear Stachys.

<span id="an_16:10">16:10</span> Give my love to Apelles, who has the
approval of Christ. Say a kind word to those who are of the house of
Aristobulus.

<span id="an_16:11">16:11</span> Give my love to Herodion, my relation.
Say a kind word to those of the house of Narcissus, who are in the Lord.

<span id="an_16:12">16:12</span> Give my love to Tryphaena and Tryphosa,
workers in the Lord. Give my love to my dear Persis, who did much work
in the Lord.

<span id="an_16:13">16:13</span> Give my love to Rufus, one of the
Lord's selection, and to his mother and mine.

<span id="an_16:14">16:14</span> Give my love to Asyncritus, Phlegon,
Hermes, Patrobas, Hermas, and the brothers who are with them.

<span id="an_16:15">16:15</span> Give my love to Philologus and Julia,
Nereus and his sister, and Olympas, and all the saints who are with
them.

<span id="an_16:16">16:16</span> Give one another a holy kiss. All the
churches of Christ send their love to you.

<span id="an_16:17">16:17</span> Now, it is my desire, brothers, that
you will take note of those who are causing division and trouble among
you, quite against the teaching which was given to you: and keep away
from them.

<span id="an_16:18">16:18</span> For such people are not servants of the
Lord Christ, but of their stomachs; and by their smooth and well-said
words the hearts of those who have no knowledge of evil are tricked.

<span id="an_16:19">16:19</span> For all have knowledge of how you do
what you are ordered. For this reason I have joy in you, but it is my
desire that you may be wise in what is good, and without knowledge of
evil.

<span id="an_16:20">16:20</span> And the God of peace will be crushing
Satan under your feet before long. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be
with you.

<span id="an_16:21">16:21</span> Timothy, who is working with me, sends
his love to you, so do Lucius and Jason and Sosipater, my relations.

<span id="an_16:22">16:22</span> I, Tertius, who have done the writing
of this letter, send love in the Lord.

<span id="an_16:23">16:23</span> Gaius, with whom I am living, whose
house is open to all the church, sends his love, so does Erastus, the
manager of the accounts of the town, and Quartus, the brother.

<span id="an_16:24">16:24</span> \[\]

<span id="an_16:25">16:25</span> Now to him who is able to make you
strong in agreement with the good news which I gave you and the
preaching of Jesus Christ, in the light of the revelation of that secret
which has been kept through times eternal,

<span id="an_16:26">16:26</span> But is now made clear; and by the
writings of the prophets, by the order of the eternal God, the knowledge
of it has been given to all the nations, so that they may come under the
rule of the faith;

<span id="an_16:27">16:27</span> To the only wise God, through Jesus
Christ, be the glory for ever. So be it.
