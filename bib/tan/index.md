# The Tanach

------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Jump to Contents](#contents.md)

This is a unicode version of the Hebrew Bible. To view this properly,
you need to have a Unicode font installed which has full Unicode Hebrew
support. For more information, refer to [this page](../../unicode.md). [A
copyrighted, redistributable Hebrew font can be obtained by clicking
here.](font.md) We cannot supply any technical support for this font or its
use.

A transliteration of the Hebrew is provided in parallel. This is
generated automatically from the Hebrew text. The system of
transliteration is based on academic conventions for the transcription
of Hebrew. [Documentation on the system of transliteration can be found
here](../osrc/tanxlit.md). Note that this should not be considered a
pronunciation guide, instead it is a verbatim romanization of the Hebrew
text.

This text is derived from the Westminister Leningrad Codex (WLC) of the
Westminister Hebrew Institute. Thanks to Christopher V. Kimball, who
graciously made the source files for this freely available. This version
is based on the October 20th, 2006 WLC release. An XML version of these
files (with additional information on the transcription) can be obtained
at <https://www.tanach.us/Tanach.xml>. Notes (see below) are in
superscript red. Ketib variants are printed in brown, and qere variants
in blue.

Transcription notes: **1** BHS has been faithful to the Leningrad Codex
where there might be a question of the validity of the form and we keep
the same form as BHS. **2** We have added a sop pasuq where L and BHS
omit it. (The added sof pasuq often is missing from the text.) **3** We
read or understand L differently than BHS (1983 Edition). this notation
indicates a typographical error in BHS. **4** Puncta Extraordaria -- a
\\u05c4 is used to mark such marks in the text when they are above the
line and a \\u0323 when they are below the line. **5** Large letter(s).
**6** Small letter(s). **7** Suspended letter(s). **8** Inverted nun in
the text. **9** BHS has abandoned L and we concur. All of these
occurrences are ketib/qere problems. **a** Adaptations to a Qere which L
and BHS, by their design, do not indicate. **m** Miscellaneous notes to
the text and occasions where more than one bracket category applies.
**q** We have abandoned or added a ketib/qere relative to BHS. In doing
this we agree with L against BHS. **y** Yathir readings in L which we
have designated as Qeres when both Dothan and BHS list a Qere.
