### LXXXVIII

### AFTER THE RESURRECTION: THE DEVOTED MARYS—CHRIST IN PERSON: "ALL HAIL"—TALKS WITH MARY MAGDALENE

A.D. 30. Age 33. *Jerusalem: The Sepulchre*.

Matthew 28, 1, and 8-10: Mark 16, 1-11: Luke 24, 1-9: John 20, 11-18.

IN the end of the sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the first *day* of
the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary, to see the sepulchre
at the rising of the sun. They came bringing the sweet spices which
they, and Salome, had prepared, that they might anoint him.

They said among themselves, Who shall roll away the stone from the door?
and they found the stone rolled away.

They entered in, and found not the body of the Lord Jesus. And it came
to pass, as they were perplexed, behold, two men stood by them in
shining garments: they said, Why seek ye the living among the dead? he
is not here: he is risen: remember how he spake when yet in Galilee,
saying,

The Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be
crucified, and the third day rise again.

They remembered: they trembled, and went out quickly, with great joy;
and did run to bring his disciples word. And, behold, Jesus met them,
saying,

<div class="jesussaid">

All hail!

</div>

And they worshipped him. Then said Jesus unto them,

<div class="jesussaid">

Be not afraid: go tell my brethren that they go into Galilee, and there
shall they see me.

</div>

Mary (Magdalene) stood without at the sepulchre weeping: and she
*looked* into the sepulchre, and seeth two angels in white, sitting.
They say, Why weepest thou?

<span id="page_139">p. 139</span>

She saith, They have taken away my Lord.

When she had thus said, she turned, and saw Jesus standing, and knew not
that it was Jesus. He saith,

<div class="jesussaid">

Woman, why weepest thou? whom seekest thou?

</div>

She, supposing him to be the gardener, saith, Sir, if thou have borne
him hence, tell me where thou hast laid him, and I will take him away.
Jesus saith,

<div class="jesussaid">

Mary.

</div>

She turned, and saith unto him, Master. Jesus saith unto her,

<div class="jesussaid">

Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended to my Father: but go to my
brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father, and your Father;
and *to* my God, and your God.

</div>

Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen the Lord,
*that* he was alive, and that he had spoken these things unto her.

And they believed her not.
