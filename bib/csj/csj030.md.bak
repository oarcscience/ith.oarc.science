### XXVII

### DOUBTERS SEEK A SIGN—"A GREATER THAN SOLOMON IS HERE"—PARABLE: THE BACKSLIDER

A.D. 28. Age 31. *Capernaum*.

Matthew 12, 38-45.

CERTAIN of the scribes and of the Pharisees answered Jesus, saying,
Master, we would see a sign from thee. But he said unto them,

<div class="jesussaid">

An evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign; and there shall
no sign be given to it, but the sign of the prophet Jonas: for as Jonas
was three days and three nights in the whale's belly; so shall the Son
of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.

The men of Nineveh shall rise in judgment with this generation, and
shall condemn it: because they repented at the preaching of Jonas; and,
behold, a greater than Jonas *is* here.

The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with this
generation, and shall condemn it: for she came from the uttermost parts

<div class="jesussaid">

of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and, behold, a greater than
Solomon *is* here.

When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh through dry
places, seeking rest, and findeth none. Then he saith, I will return
into my house from whence I came out; and when he is come, he findeth
*it* empty, swept, and garnished. Then goeth he, and taketh with himself
seven other spirits more wicked than himself, and they enter in and
dwell there: and the last *state* of that man is worse than the first.
Even so shall it be also unto this wicked generation. <span

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_29"></span>[37:\*](csj030.htm#fr_30.md) Thus Matthew (12,
43-45). In XIX of this book the same saying is phrased somewhat
differently in the narrative by Luke (11, 24-26).
