### THE MADMAN AND THE SWINE

A.D. 28. Age 31. * Sea of Galilee. Decapolis*.

Mark 5, 1-20: Luke 8, 26-40: Matthew 8, 28-34.

THEY came over unto the other side of the sea, and arrived at the
country of the Gadarenes, over against Galilee.

And when Jesus was come out of the ship, immediately there met him out
of the tombs a man <span id="fr_38"></span>[\*](#fn_37.md) with an unclean
spirit, who ware no clothes, neither abode in *any* house, but among the
tombs: he had devils long time, and no man could bind him, no not with
chains.

Jesus said,

<div class="jesussaid">

Come out of the man, *thou* unclean spirit.

</div>

He fell down before Jesus, and cried out, What have I to do with thee,
Jesus, *thou* Son of God most high? I beseech thee, torment me not. And
Jesus asked him,

<div class="jesussaid">

What *is* thy name?

</div>

He answered, Legion: for we are many.

Now there was a good way off from them a herd of swine feeding. And

<span id="page_43">p. 43</span>

the devils besought Jesus, saying, If thou cast us out, suffer us to go
away into the herd of swine.

Jesus gave them leave: he said,

<div class="jesussaid">

Go.

</div>

The unclean spirits went out, and entered into the swine; and the herd
ran violently down a steep place into the sea, and perished in the
waters. They were about two thousand.

They that fed the swine went and told it in the city. And, behold, the
whole city came out: they come to Jesus, and see him that had the
legion, sitting at the feet of Jesus, clothed, and in his right mind:
they were afraid. And the Gadarenes round about besought Jesus to depart
out of their coasts.

Jesus went up into the ship.

Now the man, out of whom the devils were departed, besought Jesus that
he might be with him: but Jesus sent him away, saying,

<div class="jesussaid">

Return to thine own house. Go home to thy friends; tell them how the
Lord had compassion on thee, and shew them how great things God hath
done unto thee.

</div>

Jesus passed over by ship unto the other side, and came into his own
city. Much people *gladly* received him.
