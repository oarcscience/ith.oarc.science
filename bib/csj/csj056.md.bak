### LIII

### SABBATH CURE OF CRIPPLED WOMAN: HYPOCRITES SHAMED—PARABLES AND PRECEPTS: THE MUSTARD SEED, LEAVEN

A.D. 29. Age 32. *Perea*.

Luke 13, 10-21.

JESUS was teaching in one of the synagogues on the sabbath. And, behold,
there was a woman which had a spirit of infirmity eighteen years, and
was bowed together, and could in no wise lift up *herself*. Jesus saw
her, and said unto her,

<div class="jesussaid">

Woman, thou are loosed from thine infirmity.

</div>

He laid *his* hands on her: and immediately she was made straight.

The ruler of the synagogue, because that Jesus had healed on the sabbath
day, said with indignation unto the people, There are six days in which
men ought to work: in them therefore come and be healed, and not on the
Sabbath day.

The Lord answered,

<span id="page_81">p. 81</span>

<div class="jesussaid">

*Thou* hypocrite, doth not each one of you on the sabbath loose his ox
or *his* ass from the stall, and lead *him* away to watering? And ought
not this woman, being a daughter of Abraham, who Satan hath bound, lo,
these eighteen years, be loosed from this bond on the sabbath day?

</div>

His adversaries were ashamed: and the people rejoiced for the glorious
things that were done by him. Then said he,

<div class="jesussaid">

 <span id="fr_68"></span>[\*](#fn_65.md)Unto what is the kingdom of God
like? and whereunto shall I resemble it? It is like a grain of mustard
seed, which a man took, and cast into his garden; and it grew, and waxed
a great tree; and the fowls of the air lodged in the branches of it.

</div>

And again he said,

<div class="jesussaid">

Whereunto shall I liken the kingdom of God? It is like leaven, which a
woman took and hid in three measures of meal, till the whole was
leavened.

</div>

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_65"></span>[81:\*](csj056.htm#fr_68.md) This parable, and the
one following, may with interest be compared with the similar ones from
Matthew (13, 31-33) at the beginning of XXIX in this book.
