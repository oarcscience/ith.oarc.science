<p>UNTO Jesus was brought one possessed with a devil, blind, and dumb; and he healed him, insomuch that the blind and dumb both spake and saw.</p>  
<p>The people were amazed, and said, Is not this the son of David? But the Pharisees said, This <i>fellow</i> doth not cast out devils, but by Beelzebub the prince of the devils.</p>  
<p>Jesus knew their thoughts, and said unto them,</p>  
<p><div class="jesussaid">&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_29"></A><A HREF="#fn_28"><FONT SIZE="1">*</FONT></A>Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and every city or house divided against itself falleth: <i>it</i> shall not stand: and if Satan cast out Satan, he is divided against himself; how shall then his kingdom stand? because ye say that I cast out devils through Beelzebub.</p>  
<p>And if I by Beelzebub cast out devils, by whom do your children cast them out? therefore they shall be your judges.</p>  
<p>But if I with the finger of God cast out devils by the Spirit of God,</div></p>

<p><div class="jesussaid">no doubt then the kingdom of God is come unto you.</p>  
<p>Or else, how can one enter into a strong man's house, and spoil his goods, except he first bind the strong man? and then he will spoil his house.</p>  
<p>When a strong man armed keepeth his palace, his goods are in peace: but when a stronger than he shall come upon him, and overcome him, he taketh from him all his armor wherein he trusted, and divideth the spoils.</p>  
<p>He that is not with me is against me; and he that gathereth not with me scattereth abroad.</p>  
<p>&para;Wherefore I say unto you, All manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto the sons of men: but the blasphemy <i>against</i> the Holy Ghost shall not be forgiven unto men.</p>  
<p>And whosoever speaketh a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him: but whosoever speaketh against the Holy Ghost is in danger of eternal damnation: it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, neither in the <i>world</i> to come.</p>  
<p>Either make the tree good, and his fruit good; or else make the tree corrupt: for the tree is known by <i>his</i> fruit.</p>  
<p>O generation of vipers, how can ye, being evil, speak good things? for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh. A good man out of the good treasure of the heart bringeth forth good things: and an evil man out of the evil treasure bringeth forth evil things.</p>  
<p>But I say unto you, That every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment.</p>  
<p>For by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned.</div></p>
