### LXVII

### PARABLE: THE KING'S GUESTS FOR HIS SON'S WEDDING—FUTILE WILES: CESAR'S TRIBUTE, THE SEVEN BROTHERS' WIDOW

A.D. 30. Age 33. *Jerusalem, in the Temple*.

Matthew 22, 1-32: Mark 12, 13-27: Luke 20, 20-38.

JESUS spake unto them again by parables,

<div class="jesussaid">

The kingdom of heaven is like unto a certain king which made a marriage
for his son, and sent forth his servants to call them that were bidden
to the wedding: and they would not come.

Again, he sent forth other servants, saying, Tell them which are bidden,
Behold, I have prepared my dinner: my oxen and my fatlings *are killed*,
and all things *are ready:* come unto the marriage. But they made light
of *it*, and went their ways, one to his farm, another to his
merchandise: and the remnant took his servants, and entreated *them*
spitefully, and slew *them*. But when the king heard *thereof*, he was
wroth: and sent forth his armies, and destroyed those murderers, and
burned up their city.

Then saith he to his servants, The wedding is ready, but they which were
bidden were not worthy. Go ye therefore into the highways, and as many
as ye shall find, bid to the marriage. So those servants went out into
the highways, and gathered all together as many as they found, both bad
and good: and the wedding was furnished with guests.

¶And when the king came in to see the guests, he saw there a man which
had not on a wedding garment: and he saith unto him, Friend, how earnest
thou in hither not having a wedding garment? And he was speechless.

Then said the king to the servants, Bind him hand and foot, and take him
away, and cast *him* into outer darkness; there shall be weeping and
gnashing of teeth.

For many are called, but few *are* chosen.

</div>

¶Then the Pharisees took counsel how they might entangle Jesus in *his*
talk. They sent spies, which should feign themselves just men, to catch
him in *his* words, that so they might deliver him unto the authority of
the governor.

When these were come, they say unto Jesus, Master, we know that thou
teachest the way of God in truth, neither acceptest the person of men.
Tell us, Is it lawful to give tribute to Cesar, or not?

Jesus perceived their craftiness, and said,

<div class="jesussaid">

Why tempt ye me, *ye* hypocrites? Shew me the tribute money; bring me a
penny, that I may see *it*. Shew me a penny.

</div>

And they brought *it*. He said unto them,

<span id="page_105">p. 105</span>

<div class="jesussaid">

Whose image and superscription hath it? Whose *is* this image and
superscription?

</div>

They answered, Cesar's. Then saith he,

<div class="jesussaid">

Render therefore unto Cesar the things which be Cesar's; and unto God
the things which be God's.

</div>

They marvelled at his answers: they held their peace, and left him.

The same day came Sadducees, which say that there is no resurrection:
and asked Jesus, saying, Moses wrote, If a man's brother die, and leave
*his* wife *behind him*, and leave no children, the brother shall marry
the wife, and raise up seed unto his brother. <span
id="fr_86"></span>[\*](#fn_82.md)

Now there were seven brethren: the first took a wife, and died without
children: the second took her to wife, and he died
[childless](errata.htm#3.md): the third likewise; and in like manner the
seven also: they died, and left no children. Last of all, the woman
died. Therefore in the resurrection whose wife of them is she?

Jesus answering said,

<div class="jesussaid">

Do ye not therefore err, because ye know not the Scriptures? Ye do err,
not knowing the Scriptures, neither the power of God.

The children of this world marry, and are given in marriage; but they
which shall be accounted worthy to obtain that world, and the
resurrection from the dead; when they shall rise from the dead, they
neither marry, nor are given in marriage: for they are equal unto the
angels of God which are in heaven; and are the children of God, being
the children of the resurrection.

Now that the dead are raised, even Moses shewed at the bush, when he
calleth the Lord the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God
of Jacob.

And as touching the resurrection of the dead, that they rise, have ye
not read in the book of Moses that which was spoken unto you by God: how
in the bush God spake unto Moses, saying, I am the God of Abraham, and
the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?

God is not the God of the dead, but the God of the living; for all live
unto him: ye therefore do greatly err.

</div>

three texts will disclose interesting differences in the phrasing (book,
