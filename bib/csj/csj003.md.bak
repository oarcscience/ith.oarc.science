### INTRODUCTION

#### BY NORMAN VINCENT PEALE, D.D.

ONE of the high spiritual moments which have enriched my life came the
day I read this book at one sitting. It was a moving and unforgettable
experience in which I had the feeling of actually being in the presence
of Jesus. It produced a strange compelling identification with the
sights, sounds and atmosphere of those times and the Lord's presence was
profoundly realistic. When I finished the book I came back to present
reality with a start. This effect was created by the fact that here we
have every recorded word spoken by Jesus and in the sequence in which he
uttered them.

This little volume offers an amazing reading experience, one in which
the reader follows the Master through the villages and about the lake
and into the cities, hearing his priceless comments to individuals and
his sermons to vast multitudes. The reading of all of his words at one
time and in chronological order produces an effect quite different from
that which is attained by reading isolated Scripture passages in which
his spoken words appear, as profoundly helpful as these are. The impact
upon mind and heart, of his whole massage, affects one profoundly.

¶This book gives a panoramic concept of the thoughts and teachings of
Jesus. And so grand and noble is the impression made upon the mind that
the reader has an enhanced understanding of the purpose of this the
greatest life ever lived. For mental stimulation, heartfelt comfort, and
soul satisfaction, <span class="smallcaps">The Complete Sayings of
Jesus</span> is unique.

¶I shall always be grateful that Lunsford P. Yandell made this little
volume known to me years ago. He explained that a friend of his, a
businessman, Arthur Hinds, sensed the importance of bringing the words
of Jesus together in chronological form so that the full sweep and
completeness of the immortal message might more effectively be felt and
comprehended. These laymen had a keen consciousness of the ineffable
power of the words of Jesus and, in a desire to relate them more widely
to busy modern people, arranged them in this convenient and readable
form. For many years this book has been made available through the
literature sales organization of the Marble Collegiate Church. The
thousands who have read the book, through our recommendation, have
reported that it has brought great spiritual blessing to them. I commend
this new edition to all who desire the creative touch of Christ upon
their lives.
