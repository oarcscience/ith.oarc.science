### XCVI

### TO THE CHURCH OF EPHESUS—"I WILL GIVE TO EAT OF THE TREE OF LIFE"

A.D. 96.

Revelation 2, 1-7.

<div class="jesussaid">

UNTO the angel of the church of Ephesus write;

These things saith he that holdeth the seven stars in his right hand,
who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks;

I know thy works, and thy labor, and thy patience, and how thou canst
not bear them which are evil: and thou hast tried them which say they
are apostles, and are not, and hast found them liars: and hast borne,
and hast patience, and for my name's sake hast labored, and hast not
fainted.

Nevertheless I have *somewhat* against thee, because thou hast left thy
first love.

Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do the
first works; or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will remove thy
candlestick out of his place, except thou repent.

But this thou hast, that thou hatest the deeds of the Nicolaitans, which
I also hate.

</div>

He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the
churches;

<div class="jesussaid">

To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life, which is
in the midst of the paradise of God.

</div>
