<p align="center">A.D. 30. Age 33. <i>Gethsemane. Jerusalem</i>.</p>  
<p align="center"><FONT SIZE="-1">Matthew 26, 48-58: Mark 14, 44-50; 53-54: Luke 22, 47-55: John 18, 10-16; 19-23.</FONT></p>  
<p>NOW Judas had given them a token (sign), saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he: hold him fast.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_102"></A><A HREF="#fn_98"><FONT SIZE="1">*</FONT></A>Judas went before, and drew near unto Jesus, to kiss him: and saith, Hail, Master; and kissed him.</p>  
<p>Jesus said unto Judas,</p>  
<p><div class="jesussaid">Friend, wherefore art thou come?&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_103"></A><A HREF="#fn_99"><FONT SIZE="1">&#8224;</FONT></A> Judas, betrayest thou the Son of man with a kiss?</div></p>  
<p>Then they laid hands on Jesus.</p>  
<p>They which were about him said, Lord, shall we smite them with the sword?</p>  
<p>And Simon Peter having a sword smote the high priest's servant, Malchas, and cut off his right ear. Jesus said,</p>  
<p><div class="jesussaid">Suffer thus far.</div></p>  
<p>And he touched his ear and healed him. Then said Jesus unto Peter,</p>  
<p><div class="jesussaid">Put up again thy sword into his place in the sheath: for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword: the cup which my Father hath given me, shall I not drink it? Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my <A HREF="errata.htm#7">Father</A>, and he shall presently give me more than twelve legions of angels? But how then shall the Scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it must be?</div></p>

<p>In that same hour said Jesus unto the multitude,</p>  
<p><div class="jesussaid">Be ye come out, as against a thief, with swords and staves for to take me?</p>  
<p>When I sat daily with you, teaching in the temple, ye stretched forth no hands against me: ye laid no hold on me: ye took me not: but this is your hour, and the power of darkness. But all this was done that the Scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled. The Scriptures must be fulfilled.</div></p>  
<p>Then all the disciples forsook him, and fled.</p>  
<p>&para;The officers of the Jews bound Jesus and led him away. They brought him into the palace of the high priest, Caiaphas that year.</p>  
<p>Simon Peter followed, to see the end. And <i>so did</i> another disciple: that disciple was known to Caiaphas, and went with Jesus into the palace. But Peter stood at the door without. Then went out that disciple and spake unto her that kept the door, and brought in Peter.</p>  
<p>When they had kindled a fire in the midst of the hall, Peter sat amongst the servants, and warmed himself at the fire.</p>  
<p>&para;With Caiaphas the high priest were assembled the chief priests and the elders and the scribes.</p>  
<p>Caiaphas asked Jesus of his disciples, and of his doctrine, Jesus answered,</p>  
<p><div class="jesussaid">I spake openly to the world: I ever taught in the synagogues, and in the temple, whither the Jews always resort: and in secret have I said nothing. Ask them which heard me, what I have said unto them: behold, they know what I said. Why askest thou me?</div></p>  
<p>When Jesus had thus spoken, one of the officers struck him with the palm of his hand, saying, Answerest thou the high priest so? Jesus answered,</p>  
<p><div class="jesussaid">If I have spoken evil, bear witness to the evil: but if well, why smitest thou me?</div></p>
