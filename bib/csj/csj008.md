### V

### CHRIST'S LONG FAST IN THE WILDERNESS—SATAN'S FUTILE WILES

A.D. 27. Age 30. *Judea*.

Matthew 4, 1-11: Mark 1, 13: Luke 4, 1-13.

THEN was Jesus led up of the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of
the devil. He was there in the wilderness forty days, and was with the
wild beasts.

In those days he did eat nothing. And when he had fasted forty days and
forty nights, he was a hungered.

The tempter came: he said, If thou be the Son of God, command that these
stones be made bread. But Jesus answered,

<div class="jesussaid">

It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that
proceedeth out of the mouth of God.

</div>

Then, in Jerusalem, the holy city, on a pinnacle of the temple, the
devil saith unto Jesus, If thou be the Son of God, cast thyself down
from hence: for it is written, He shall give his angels charge
concerning thee, to keep thee: and in *their* hands they shall bear thee
up, lest at any time thou dash they foot against a stone.

Jesus answering said,

<div class="jesussaid">

It is written again, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.

</div>

Again, up an exceeding high mountain, the devil sheweth him, in a moment
of time, all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them, and saith
unto Jesus, All these things will I give thee; all this power, and the
glory of them: if thou wilt fall down and worship me, all shall be
thine.

<span id="page_9">p. 9</span>

And Jesus answered,

<div class="jesussaid">

Get thee behind me, Satan; get thee hence: for it is written, Thou shalt
worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve.

</div>

Then the devil leaveth him.
