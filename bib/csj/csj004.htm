<p>THE book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham:</p>  
<p>Abraham begat Isaac; and Isaac begat . . . .</p>  
<p>. . .. And Jesse begat David the king; and David the king begat Solomon; and Solomon begat . . . .</p>  
<p>. . .. And Josias begat Jechonias and his brethren, about the time they were carried away to Babylon; and Jechonias begat . . . .</p>  
<p>. . .. And Jacob begat Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus who is called Christ.</p>  
<p>So all the generations from Abraham to David <i>are</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_0"></A><A HREF="#fn_0"><FONT SIZE="1">*</FONT></A> fourteen generations; and from David until the carrying away into Babylon <i>are</i> fourteen generations; and from the carrying away into Babylon unto Christ <i>are</i> fourteen generations.</p>

<p><FONT SIZE="-1">Luke 2, 1-12; 16-21.</FONT></p>  
<p>It came to pass in those days, that there went out a decree from Cesar Augustus, that all the world should be taxed. And all went to be taxed, every one into his own city.</p>  
<p>Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into Judea, unto the city of David which is called Bethlehem (because he was of the house and lineage of David), to be taxed with Mary his espoused wife, being great with child.</p>  
<p>So it was, that, while they were there, the days were accomplished that she should be delivered. She brought forth her firstborn son, and wrapped him in swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger; because there was no room for them in the inn. <i>Dec. B.C. 5</i>.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1"></A><A HREF="#fn_1"><FONT SIZE="1">&#8224;</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&para;There were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night. And, lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them, and said, Behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people. For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Savior, which is Christ the Lord. Ye shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a manger.</p>

<p>And they came with haste, and found Mary, and Joseph, and the babe lying in a manger.</p>  
<p>When eight days were accomplished for the circumcising of the child, his name was called <i>JESUS</i>, which was so named of the angel before he was conceived in the womb.</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_1"></A><A HREF="csj004.htm#fr_1">5:&#8224;</A> It happens that dates "from the birth of Christ" did not begin to be cast until centuries after Christ's day. The monk said to be then responsible for the calculations made a mistake. The consensus of informed opinion now is that the "birth" of Jesus is to be set back <i>four</i> years. Accordingly the boy Jesus was "<i>five</i> years old" in December of what would have been the first year of the <i>anno Domini</i> calendar if that calendar had been started on the day of his birth: that is, five years and one week old on New Year's Day, A.D. 2.</P>
