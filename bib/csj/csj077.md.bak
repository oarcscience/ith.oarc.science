### LXXIV

### JESUS SUPS IN BETHANY: MARTHA SERVES, MARY'S DEVOTION, JUDAS’ DUPLICITY, JESUS LAUDS MARY'S HOMAGE—CHIEF PRIESTS ASTIR

A.D. 30. Age 33. *Bethany*.

John 12, 1-11: Matthew 26, 6-13: Mark 14, 3-9.

JESUS came, six days before the passover, to Bethany, where Lazarus was,
whom he had raised from the dead. In the house of Simon the leper there,
they made Jesus a supper; and Martha served. Lazarus was one of them at
the table with Jesus.

Mary, having an alabaster box of ointment of spikenard very precious,
brake the box, and poured *it* on Jesus’ head as he sat at meat, and
anointed his feet, and wiped his feet with her hair. <span

Some disciples had indignation, saying, To what purpose *is* this waste?
Judas Iscariot \[which should betray Jesus\] saith, Why was not this
ointment sold for three hundred pence, and given to the poor? And they
murmured against Mary.

When Jesus understood *it*, he said.

<div class="jesussaid">

Let her alone: why trouble ye the woman? Against the day of my burying
hath she done this.

For ye have the poor with you always, and whensoever ye will ye may do
them good: but me ye have not always. She hath wrought a good work upon
me; for she hath done what she could: for in that she hath poured this
ointment on my body, she is come aforehand to anoint my body to the
burying (she did it for my burial). Why trouble ye her?

Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached
throughout the whole world, *there* shall also this that this woman hath
done, be told for a memorial of her.

</div>

The Jews knew that Jesus was there: and they came, not for Jesus’ sake
only, but that they might see Lazarus, whom he had raised from the dead.

But the chief priests consulted that they might put Lazarus also to
death; because that by reason of him many of the Jews believed on Jesus.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_90"></span>[116:\*](csj077.htm#fr_94.md) Turn back to LVIII in
this book, and read again the story of Mary's brother Lazarus. And in
XXV read of a like service done by the "woman which was a sinner."
