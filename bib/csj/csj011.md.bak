### VIII

### NIGHTTIME VISIT OF NICODEMUS—CHRIST ENLIGHTENS HIM

April, A.D. 27 Age 30. *Jerusalem*.

John 3, 1-21.

A MAN of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews, came to
Jesus by night, and said unto him, Master, we know that thou art a
teacher come from God: for no man can do these miracles that thou doest,
except God be with him. Jesus answered,

<div class="jesussaid">

Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot
see the kingdom of God.

</div>

Nicodemus saith unto him, How can a man be born when he is old? Jesus
answered,

<div class="jesussaid">

Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and of
the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God. That which is born
of the flesh is flesh: and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.

Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again. The wind
bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst
not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every one that is
born of the Spirit.

</div>

Nicodemus said, How can these things be? Jesus answered,

<div class="jesussaid">

Art thou a master of Israel, and knowest not these things? Verily,
verily, I say unto thee, We speak that we do know, and testify that we
have seen; and ye receive not our witness.

If I have told you earthly things, and ye believe not, how shall ye
believe, if I tell you *of* heavenly things? And no man hath ascended up
to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, *even* the Son of man
which is in heaven.

¶And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the
Son of man be lifted up: that whosoever believeth in him should not
perish, but have eternal life.

¶For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that
whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.
For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that
the world through him might be saved.

¶He that believeth on him is not condemned; but he that believeth not is
condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only
begotten Son of God.

And this is the condemnation, that light has come into the world, and
men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil. For
every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light,
lest his deeds should be reproved. But he that doeth truth cometh to the
light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in
God. <span id="fr_7"></span>[\*](#fn_7.md)
