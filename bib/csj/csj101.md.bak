### XCVIII

### TO THE CHURCH IN PERGAMOS—"REPENT, OR ELSE I WILL COME QUICKLY"

A.D. 96

Revelation 2, 12-17.

<div class="jesussaid">

AND to the angel of the church in Pergamos write;

These things saith he which hath the sharp sword with two edges;

I know thy works, and where thou dwellest, *even* where Satan's seat
*is;* and thou holdest fast my name, and hast not denied my faith, even
in those days wherein Antipas *was* my faithful martyr, who was slain
among you, where Satan dwelleth.

But I have a few things against thee, because thou hast there them that
hold the doctrine of Balaam, who taught Balak to cast a stumbling-block
before the children of Israel, to eat things sacrificed unto idols, and
to commit fornication.

¶So hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of the Nicolaitans, which
thing I hate.

Repent; or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will fight against
them with the sword of my mouth.

</div>

He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the
churches;

<div class="jesussaid">

To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the hidden manna, and will
give him a white stone, and in the stone a new name written, which no
man knoweth saving he that receiveth *it*.

</div>
