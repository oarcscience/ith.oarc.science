### XCIII

### THE LORD TO PAUL IN A VISION

A.D. 54. *Corinth*.

Luke: Acts 18, 7-11.

PAUL entered into a certain man's house, named Justus one that
worshipped God, whose house joined hard to the synagogue.

Then spake the Lord to Paul in the night by a vision,

<div class="jesussaid">

Be not afraid, but speak, and hold not thy peace; for I am with thee,
and no man shall set on thee to hurt thee; for I have much people in
this city.

</div>

And Paul continued *there* for a year and six months, teaching the word
of God.

### PAUL'S FAREWELL TO THE EPHESIANS

A.D. 66. *Miletus*.

Luke: Acts 20, 17-19, 22, 25, 32-38.

FROM Miletus he (Paul) sent to Ephesus, and called the elders of the
church.

When they were come, he said unto them, Ye know, from the first day that
I came into Asia, after what manner I have been with you at all times,
serving the Lord with humility, with temptations which befell me by the
lying in wait of the Jews.

Now I go bound in the spirit unto Jerusalem. not knowing the things that
shall befall me there. I know that ye all, among whom I have gone,
preaching the kingdom of God, shall see my face no more.

Brethren, I commend you to God.

I have coveted no man's silver, or gold, or apparel. Yea, ye know, that
these hands <span id="fr_113"></span>[\*](#fn_108.md) have ministered unto
my necessities. I have shewed you how that so laboring ye ought to
support the weak, and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus, how he
said,

<div class="jesussaid">

It is more blessed to give than to receive.

</div>

When Paul had thus spoken, he prayed with them all. They all wept,
sorrowing for the words which he spake, that they should see his face no
more. And they accompanied him unto the ship.

custom of the Jewish rabbis was to acquire a mechanical trade. Paul's
was tent-making.
