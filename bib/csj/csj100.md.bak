### XCVII

### TO THE CHURCH IN SMYRNA—"BE THOU FAITHFUL UNTO DEATH"

A.D. 96

Revelation 2, 8-11.

<div class="jesussaid">

AND unto the angel of the church in Smyrna write;

These things saith the first and the last, which was dead, and is alive;

I know thy works, and tribulation, and poverty (but thou art rich); and
*I know* the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews, and are not, but
*are* the synagogue of Satan.

Fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer: behold, the devil
shall cast *some* of you into prison, that ye may be tried; and ye shall
have tribulation ten days: be thou faithful unto death, and I will give
thee a crown of life.

</div>

He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the
churches;

<div class="jesussaid">

He that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second death.

</div>
