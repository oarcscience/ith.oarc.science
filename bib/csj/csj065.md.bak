### LXII

### JESUS TELLS OF IMMINENT BETRAYAL, DEATH, RESURRECTION—THE MOTHER OF JAMES AND JOHN VOICES THEIR AMBITION—"THE CHIEFEST SHALL BE SERVANT"

A.D. 30. Age 33. *Perea*.

Matthew 20, 17-28: Mark 10, 32-45: Luke 18, 31-34.

JESUS going up to Jerusalem took again the disciples apart in the way,
and began to tell them what things should happen unto him, *saying*,

<div class="jesussaid">

Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man shall be betrayed and
delivered unto the chief priests, and unto the scribes; and he shall be
spitefully entreated and spitted on; and they shall condemn him to
death, and shall deliver him unto the Gentiles.

They shall mock him, and shall scourge him, and shall crucify and kill
him: and the third day he shall rise again.

And all the things that are written by the prophets concerning the Son
of man shall be accomplished.

</div>

They (the twelve) understood none of this saying; neither knew they the
things which were spoken.

¶Then came unto Jesus the mother of James and John, the sons of Zebedee,
desiring a certain thing of him. <span id="fr_78"></span>[\*](#fn_75.md) He
said unto her,

<div class="jesussaid">

What wilt thou?

And he said unto them,

What would ye that I should do for you?

</div>

She saith, Grant that these my two sons may sit, the one on thy right
hand, and the other on the left, in glory in thy kingdom. But Jesus said
*unto them*,

<div class="jesussaid">

Ye know not what ye ask: are ye able to drink of the cup that I shall
drink of, and to be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?

</div>

And they say, We can. Jesus answered,

<div class="jesussaid">

Ye shall drink indeed of my cup, the cup that I drink of: and with the
baptism that I am baptized withal ye shall be baptized: but to sit

</div>

<span id="page_97">p. 97</span>

<div class="jesussaid">

on my right hand and on my left hand, is not mine to give, but *it shall
be given to them* for whom it is prepared of my Father.

</div>

The ten were moved with indignation against the two brethren. But Jesus
called them to *him*, and said,

<div class="jesussaid">

Ye know that the princes of the Gentiles exercise dominion over them; ye
know that they which are accounted to rule over the Gentiles exercise
lordship over them; and their great ones exercise authority upon them.

But so shall it not be among you: but whosoever will be great among you,
shall be your minister: and whosoever of you will be the chiefest, shall
be servant of all: let him be your servant, even as the Son of man: for
even the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and
to give his life a ransom for many.

</div>

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_75"></span>[96:\*](csj065.htm#fr_78.md) Thus Matthew. Mark
puts the plea into the mouths of the sons themselves. The two accounts
are: Matthew 20, 20-28: Mark 10, 35-45.
