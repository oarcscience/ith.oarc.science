### LXXXV

### CHRIST CROWNED WITH THORNS, ROBED IN SCARLET—MOCKED—"IN A GREEN TREE, IN THE DRY?"—THE CRUCIFIXION—"FATHER, FORGIVE THEM"—PILATE WRITES THE TITLE

A.D. 30. Age 33. *Jerusalem. Golgotha: Calvary*.

Matthew 27, 27-38: Mark 15, 16-27: Luke 23, 26-34: John 19, 17-20.

THE soldiers of the governor led Jesus into the common hall, called
Pretorium. They stripped him, and clothed him with purple (put on him a
scarlet robe): they platted a crown of thorns, and put it about his
head.

¶Then came Jesus forth wearing the crown of thorns, and the purple robe.
They mocked him, saying, Hail, King of the Jews!

After they had mocked him, they took off the purple from him, put his
own raiment on him, smote him with their hands, and led him away to
crucify *him*.

There followed a great company of people, and of women, which bewailed
him. But Jesus turning said,

<div class="jesussaid">

Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but weep for yourselves, and
for your children. For, behold, the days are coming, in the which they
shall say, Blessed *are* the barren, and the wombs that never bare, and
the paps which never gave suck.

Then shall they begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us: and to the
hills, Cover us.

For if they do these things in a green tree, what shall be done in the
dry?

</div>

And Jesus bearing his cross went forth.

As they came out, one Simon, a man of Cyrene, passed by, coming out of
the country: him they compelled, and on him they laid the cross, that he
might bear *it* after Jesus.

¶When they were come to a place called *the place* of a skull, which is
in the Hebrew, Golgotha: to the place called Calvary, they gave to Jesus
wine mingled with myrrh (vinegar mingled with gall): when he had tasted
*thereof*, he would not drink. It was the third hour.

And there they crucified Jesus: him and the two malefactors: one on the
right hand, and the other on the left, and Jesus in the midst. Then said
Jesus,

<div class="jesussaid">

Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do.

</div>

Pilate wrote a title, and put *it* on the cross. It was written in
Hebrew, *and* Greek, *and* Latin: JESUS OF NAZARETH THE KING OF THE
JEWS.
