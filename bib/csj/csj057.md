### LIV

### JOURNEYING TOWARD JERUSALEM—PARABLE: THE SHUT DOOR—WARNED OF HEROD—"O JERUSALEM, JERUSALEM!"—MARTHA AND MARY

A.D. 29. Age 32. *Perea. Bethany*.

Luke 13, 22-35; 10, 38-42: John 10, 39-40.

JESUS went through the cities and villages, teaching, and journeying
toward Jerusalem.

One said unto him, Lord, are there few that be saved? And he said,

<div class="jesussaid">

Strive to enter in at the strait gate: for many, I say unto you, will
seek to enter in, and shall not be able.

When once the master of the house is risen up, and hath shut the door,
and ye being to stand without, and to knock at the door, saying, Lord,
Lord, open unto us: and he shall answer and say unto you, I know you not
whence ye are: Then shall ye begin to say, We have eaten and drunk in
thy presence, and thou hast taught in our streets.

But he shall say, I tell you, I know you not whence ye are; depart from
me, all *ye* workers of iniquity.

There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth, when ye shall see Abraham,
and Isaac, and Jacob, and all the prophets, in the kingdom of God, and
you *yourselves* thrust out.

And they shall come from the east, and *from* the west, and from the
north, and *from* the south, and shall sit down in the kingdom of God.

And, behold, there are last which shall be first; and there are first
which shall be last.

</div>

¶The same day there came Pharisees saying unto Jesus, Depart hence; for
Herod will kill thee. And he said unto them,

<div class="jesussaid">

Go ye, and tell that fox, Behold, I cast out devils, and I do cures to
day and to morrow, and the third *day* I shall be perfected.
Nevertheless I must walk to day, and to morrow, and the *day* following:
for it cannot be that a prophet perish out of Jerusalem.

O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, which killest the prophets, and stonest them
that are sent unto thee; how often would I have gathered thy children
together, as a hen *doth gather* her brood under her wings, and ye would
not! Behold, your house is left unto you desolate: and verily I say unto
you, Ye shall not see me, until *the time* come when ye shall say,
Blessed *is* he that cometh in the name of the Lord.

</div>

Now it came to pass, as they went, that Jesus entered into a certain
village: <span id="fr_69"></span>[\*](#fn_66.md) and a woman named Martha
received him into her house. She had a sister, Mary, which sat at Jesus’
feet, and heard his word.

But Martha, cumbered about much serving, said, Lord, dost thou not care
that my sister hath left me to serve alone? Bid her that she help me.

Jesus answered,

<div class="jesussaid">

Martha, Martha, thou are careful and troubled about many things: but one
thing is needful; and Mary hath chosen that good part, which shall not
be taken away from her.

</div>

¶The Jews sought again to take Jesus: but he went away beyond Jordan
into the place where John at first baptized; and he abode there.
