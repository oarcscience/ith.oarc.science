### LXXXI

### CHRIST AGAIN FORETELLS PETER'S THREE DENIALS—IN GETHSEMANE PRAYS WHILE APOSTLES SLEEP—THE SPIRIT WILLING, THE FLESH WEAK —JUDAS AND CROWD WITH WEAPONS FIND JESUS

A.D. 30. Age 33. *Mount of Olives. Gethsemane*.

Matthew 26, 30-47: Mark 14, 26-43: Luke 22, 39-47: John 18, 1-9.

 <span id="fr_99"></span>[\*](#fn_95.md)WHEN they had sung a hymn, Jesus
came out; and he went as he was wont, to the mount of Olives; and his
disciples followed him. Then saith Jesus unto them,

<div class="jesussaid">

All ye shall be offended <span id="fr_100"></span>[†](#fn_96.md) because of
me this night: for it is written, I will smite the Shepherd, and the
sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad.

But after that I am risen again, I will go before you into Galilee.

</div>

Peter answered, Although all shall be offended because of thee, *yet*
will not I. I will never be offended. Jesus saith unto him,

<div class="jesussaid">

Verily I say unto thee, That this day, *even* in this night, before the
cock crow twice, thou shalt deny me thrice.

</div>

But Peter spake the more vehemently, Though I should die with thee, yet
will I not deny thee in any wise. Likewise said they all.

¶They came to a place named Gethsemane, over the brook Cedron, where was
a garden, into the which Jesus entered and his disciples. And he said
unto them,

<div class="jesussaid">

Sit ye here, while I go and pray yonder. Pray that ye enter not into
temptation.

</div>

He was withdrawn from them about a stone's cast; with him Peter, James,
and John. Then saith he unto them,

<div class="jesussaid">

My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death: tarry ye here, and
watch with me.

</div>

He went forward a little, and kneeled, and prayed,

<div class="jesussaid">

Abba, Father, all things *are* possible unto thee: Father, if it be
possible, if thou be willing, remove this cup from me: nevertheless not
my will, but thine, be done. <span id="fr_101"></span>[‡](#fn_97.md)

</div>

<span id="page_129">p. 129</span>

Being in an agony he prayed more earnestly: and his sweat was as it were
great drops of blood.

And he cometh unto the disciples, and findeth them sleeping. He saith
unto Peter,

<div class="jesussaid">

Simon, sleepest thou? What, couldest not thou watch with me one hour?
Watch ye and pray, lest ye enter into temptation. The spirit truly is
willing, but the flesh is weak.

</div>

Jesus went away the second time, and prayed,

<div class="jesussaid">

O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: if this cup
may not pass away from me, except I drink it, thy will be done.

</div>

When he rose up, and was come to the disciples, he found them sleeping
for sorrow, and he said unto them,

<div class="jesussaid">

Why sleep ye? rise and pray, lest ye enter into temptation.

</div>

He went away again, and prayed the third time, saying the same words,

<div class="jesussaid">

Father, take away this cup from me: nevertheless not what I will, but
what thou wilt.

</div>

And he cometh the third time, and again he found the disciples asleep;
and he saith,

<div class="jesussaid">

Sleep on now, and take *your* rest: it is enough: behold, the hour is
come; behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of man is betrayed into
the hands of sinners. Rise up, let us be going: lo, he is at hand that
doth betray me.

</div>

¶Judas knew the place: for Jesus ofttimes resorted thither with his
disciples.

Immediately, while Jesus yet spake, cometh Judas, and with him a
multitude: a band *of men* from the chief priests and Pharisees; and the
scribes and elders of the people, with lanterns and torches, and
weapons: swords and staves.

Jesus knowing all things that should come upon him, went forth, and said
unto them,

<div class="jesussaid">

Whom seek ye?

</div>

They answered, Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus saith,

<div class="jesussaid">

I am he.

</div>

They went backward, and fell to the ground. Then asked he them again,

<div class="jesussaid">

Whom seek ye?

</div>

<span id="page_130">p. 130</span>

They said, Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus answered,

<div class="jesussaid">

I have told you that I am *he:* if therefore ye seek me, let these go
their way.

</div>

That the saying might be fulfilled, which he spake,

<div class="jesussaid">

Of them which thou gavest me have I lost none.

</div>

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_95"></span>[128:\*](csj084.htm#fr_99.md) Much of interest can
be gleaned from a comparison, paragraph by paragraph, of the texts of
the several narrators, from this point to the end (Matthew 26, 30 . ..
Mark 14, 26 . . .: Luke 22, 39 . . .: John 18, 1 . . .; and so on).

<span id="fn_96"></span>[128:†](csj084.htm#fr_100.md) . . . *be offended:*
fall away, desert.

<span id="fn_97"></span>[128:‡](csj084.htm#fr_101.md) Mark has it, ". . .
nevertheless not what I will, but what thou wilt."
