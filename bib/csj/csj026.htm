<p align="center">A.D. 28 . Age 31. <i>Galilee, near Cana</i>.</p>

<p>NOW when John had heard in the prison the works of Christ, he sent two of his disciples to Jesus. Unto him they said, John Baptist hath sent us unto thee, saying, Art thou he that should come? or do we look for another?</p>  
<p>And in that same hour Jesus cured many of <i>their</i> infirmities; and unto many <i>that were</i> blind he gave sight.</p>  
<p>Then said Jesus unto the two disciples [of John],</p>  
<p><div class="jesussaid">Go your way, and tell John again what things ye have seen and heard: how that the blind receive their sight, and the lane walk, the lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, and the poor have the gospel preached to them. And blessed is he, whosoever shall not be offended&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_25"></A><A HREF="#fn_24"><FONT SIZE="1">&#8224;</FONT></A> in me.</div></p>  
<p>&para;When the messengers of John were departed, Jesus began to speak unto the people concerning John,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_26"></A><A HREF="#fn_25"><FONT SIZE="1">&#8225;</FONT></A></p>

<p><div class="jesussaid">What went ye out into the wilderness for to see? A reed shaken with the wind? But what went ye out for to see? A man clothed in soft raiment? Behold, they that wear soft <i>clothing</i>, they which are gorgeously apparelled, and live delicately, are in kings&#8217; courts, in kings&#8217; houses.</p>  
<p>But what went ye out for to see? A prophet? Yea, I say unto you, and much more than a prophet. For this is <i>he</i> of whom it is written, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee.</p>  
<p>Verily, I say unto you, Among them that are born of women there hath not risen a greater prophet than John the Baptist: notwithstanding, he that is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he.</p>  
<p>And from the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence, and the violent take it by force. For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John. And if ye will receive <i>it</i>, this is Elias, which was for to come.</p>  
<p>He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.</div></p>  
<p>The people that heard <i>him</i>, and the publicans, justified God, being baptized with the baptism of John. But the Pharisees and lawyers rejected the counsel of God against themselves, being not baptized of him. Jesus said,</p>  
<p><div class="jesussaid">&para;But whereunto then shall I liken the men of this generation? and to what are they like? They are like unto children sitting in the marketplace, and calling unto their fellows, one to another, and saying, We have piped unto you, and ye have not danced; we have mourned unto you, and ye have not lamented: ye have not wept.</p>  
<p>For John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine; and they say, He hath a devil. The Son of man is come eating and drinking; and they say, Behold a man gluttonous and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and sinners!</p>  
<p>But wisdom is justified of all her children.</div></p>
