### XCI

### AFTER THE RESURRECTION (CONTINUED): CHRIST IN PERSON: HIS LAST TALK WITH THE ELEVEN—"GO YE AND PREACH THE GOSPEL TO EVERY CREATURE"—THE ASCENSION

A.D. 30. Age 33. *Galilee. Mt. Olivet. Bethany*.

Matthew 28, 16-20: Mark 16, 12-18: Luke 24, 44-53; and Luke's Acts of
The Apostles 1, 12.

THE eleven disciples went into a mountain in Galilee, where Jesus had
appointed them. And he came, saying,

<div class="jesussaid">

Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.

He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth
not shall be damned.

And these signs shall follow them that believe: In my name shall they
cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues; they shall take up
serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them;
they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover.

All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth.

Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of
the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost: teaching them to
observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with
you alway, *even* unto the end of the world.

</div>

And Jesus said unto them (the eleven),

<div class="jesussaid">

These are the words which I spake unto you, while I was with you, That
all things must be fulfilled, which were written in the law of Moses,
and *in* the prophets, and *in* the psalms, concerning me.

</div>

Then opened he their understanding, that they might understand the
Scriptures; and said unto them,

<div class="jesussaid">

Thus it is written, and thus it behooved Christ to suffer, and to rise
from the dead the third day: and that repentance and remission of sins
should be preached in his name among all nations, beginning at
Jerusalem.

And ye are witnesses of these things.

And, behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you: but tarry ye in
the city of Jerusalem, until ye be endued with power from on high.

</div>

¶And he led them out as far as to Bethany; and he lifted up his hands,
and blessed them.

And it came to pass, while he blessed them, he was parted from them, and
carried up into heaven; and a cloud received him out of their sight.

¶Then returned they with great joy unto Jerusalem, from the mount called
Olivet, which is from Jerusalem a sabbath day's journey.

They were continually in the temple praising and blessing God.
