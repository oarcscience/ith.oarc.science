<p align="center">A.D. 30. Age 33. <i>Mount of Olives</i>.</p>  
<p align="center"><FONT SIZE="-1">Matthew 25, 14-46.</FONT></p>  
<p><div class="jesussaid">&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_93"></A><A HREF="#fn_89"><FONT SIZE="1">*</FONT></A>FOR <i>the kingdom of heaven is</i> as a man travelling into a far country, <i>who</i> called his own servants, and delivered unto them his goods. And unto one he gave five talents, to another, two, and to another, one; to every man according to his several ability; and straightway took his journey.</p>  
<p>Then he that had received the five talents went and traded with the same, and made <i>them</i> other five talents. And likewise he that <i>had received</i> two, he also gained other two. But he that had received one went and digged in the earth, and hid his lord's money.</p>  
<p>After a long time the lord of those servants cometh, and reckoned with them.</p>  
<p>And so he that had received five talents came and brought other five talents, saying, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me five talents: behold, I have gained beside them five talents more. His lord said unto him, Well done, <i>thou</i> good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.</p>  
<p>He also that had received two talents came and said, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me two talents: behold, I have gained two other talents beside them. His lord said unto him, Well done, good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.</div></p>

<p><div class="jesussaid">Then he which had received the one talent came and said, Lord, I knew thee that thou art a hard man, reaping where thou hast not sown, and gathering where thou hast not strewed; and I was afraid, and went and hid thy talent in the earth: lo, <i>there</i> thou hast <i>that is</i> thine.</p>  
<p>His lord answered and said unto him, <i>Thou</i> wicked and slothful servant, thou knewest that I reap where I sowed not, and gather where I have not strewed: Thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the exchangers, and <i>then</i> at my coming I should have received mine own with usury.</p>  
<p>Take therefore the talent from him, and give <i>it</i> unto him which hath ten talents.</p>  
<p>For unto every one that hath shall be given, and he shall have abundance: but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath. And cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</p>  
<p>&para;When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory: and before him shall be gathered all nations: and he shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd divideth <i>his</i> sheep from the goats: and he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left.</p>  
<p>Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world: for I was a hungered, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in: naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was in prison, and ye came unto me.</p>  
<p>Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee a hungered, and fed <i>thee?</i> or thirsty, and gave <i>thee</i> drink? When saw we thee a stranger, and took <i>thee</i> in? or naked, and clothed <i>thee?</i> Or when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee?</p>  
<p>And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done <i>it</i> unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done <i>it</i> unto me.</p>  
<p>Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels: for I was a hungered, and ye gave me no meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me no drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me not in: naked, and ye clothed me not; sick, and in prison, and ye visited me not.</p>  
<p>Then shall they also answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee a hungered, or athirst, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister unto thee?</p>  
<p>Then he shall answer them, saying, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye did <i>it</i> not to one of the least of these, ye did <i>it</i> not to me.</p>  
<p>And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the righteous into life eternal.</div></p>
