<p align="center">A.D. 30. Age 33. <i>Jerusalem</i>.</p>  
<p align="center"><FONT SIZE="-1">John 18, 28-40; 19, 1-16: Luke 23, 1-11; 13-25: Mark 15, 1-15: Matthew 27, 11-26.</FONT></p>  
<p>THE whole council arose and led Jesus away from the high priest, Caiaphas, and delivered him to Pontius Pilate the governor, in the hall of judgment.</p>  
<p>Pilate went out unto them, and said, Take ye him, and judge him according to your law.</p>  
<p>The Jews answered, It is not lawful for us to put any man to death.</p>  
<p>Then Pilate entered into the judgment hall again, and called Jesus, and said unto him, Art thou the King of Jews? Jesus answered,</p>  
<p><div class="jesussaid">Sayest thou this thing of thyself, or did others tell it thee of me?</div></p>  
<p>Pilate answered, Am I a Jew? Thine own nation have delivered thee unto me: what hast thou done? Jesus answered,</p>  
<p><div class="jesussaid">My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the Jews: but now is my kingdom not from hence.</div></p>  
<p>Pilate therefore said, Art thou a king then? Jesus answered,</p>  
<p><div class="jesussaid">Thou sayest that I am a king. To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness unto the truth. very one that is of the truth heareth my voice.</div></p>  
<p>Pilate answered, What is truth? And when he had said this, he went out again unto the Jews, and saith unto them, I find in him no fault <i>at all</i>. But ye have a custom that I should release unto you one at the passover: will ye that I release the King of the Jews?</p>  
<p>Then cried they all, Not this man, but Barabbas.</p>  
<p>Now Barabbas was a robber.</p>  
<p>The chief priests and the officers cried out, Crucify <i>him</i>, crucify him.</p>  
<p>Pilate saith, Take ye him, and crucify <i>him:</i> for I find no fault in him.</p>  
<p>The Jews answered, By our law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God.</p>  
<p>&para;When Pilate heard that saying, he saith unto Jesus, Whence art thou? But Jesus gave no answer.</p>  
<p>Then saith Pilate, Speakest thou not unto me? knowest thou not that</p>  
<p><a name="page_134"><font size="1" color="green">p. 134</font></A></p>  
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> I have power to crucify thee, and have power to release thee? Jesus answered,</p>  
<p><div class="jesussaid">Thou couldest have no power <i>at all</i> against me, except it were given thee from above: therefore he that delivered me unto thee hath the greater sin.</div></p>  
<p>Thenceforth Pilate sought to release Jesus: but the Jews cried out, We found this <i>fellow</i> forbidding to give tribute to Cesar, saying that he himself is Christ a king. If thou let this man go, thou art not Cesar's friend: whosoever maketh himself a king speaketh against Cesar.</p>  
<p>Pilate asked him, Art thou the King of the Jews? And Jesus saith,</p>  
<p><div class="jesussaid">Thou sayest it.</div></p>  
<p>The chief priests accused him of many things: but he answered nothing.</p>  
<p>And Pilate asked him again, Answerest thou nothing? hearest thou not how many things they witness against thee?</p>  
<p>Jesus answered him to never a word; so that Pilate marvelled: and he said to the people, I find no fault in this man.</p>  
<p>They were the more fierce, saying, He stirreth up the people throughout Jewry, from Galilee to this place.</p>  
<p>When Pilate heard of Galilee, he asked whether the man were a Galilean. And as soon as he knew that Jesus belonged unto Herod's jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who was at Jerusalem at that time.</p>  
<p>&para;Herod was exceeding glad: for he had heard many things of Jesus; and had hoped to see some miracle done by him. He questioned with Jesus in many words; but Jesus answered him nothing. And Herod sent <i>him</i> back to Pilate.</p>  
<p>&para;Pilate called together the chief priests and the rulers of the people; and he said unto them, Ye have brought this man unto me, as one that perverteth the people; and, behold, I, having examined <i>him</i> before you, have found no fault in him touching those things whereof ye accuse him: no, nor yet Herod.</p>  
<p>&para;Now at <i>that</i> feast the governor must of necessity release unto the people a prisoner, whom they would.</p>  
<p>Pilate therefore said, Will ye that I release unto you Barabbas? or Jesus which is called the Christ?</p>  
<p>They cried out all at once, Release Barabbas.</p>  
<p>Pilate saith, What shall I do then with Jesus?</p>  
<p>They cried out again, Let him be crucified.</p>  
<p>Pilate saith, Shall I crucify your King?</p>  
<p>The chief priests answered, We have no king but Cesar.</p>  
<p>&para;When Pilate saw that he could prevail nothing, he took water, and washed <i>his</i> hands before the multitude, saying, I am innocent of the blood of this just person: see ye <i>to it</i>.</p>  
<p>Then answered the people, His blood be on us, and on our children.</p>  
<p>And <i>so</i> Pilate, willing to content the people, gave sentence that it should be as they required. He released him that for sedition and murder was cast into prison: but he delivered Jesus, when he had scourged <i>him</i>, to their will, to be crucified.</p>
