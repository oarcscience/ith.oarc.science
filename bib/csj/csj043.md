### CHRIST DISCLOSES HIS SONSHIP—ADVANCES PETER—FORETELLS HIS OWN FATE—"WHAT SHALL IT PROFIT A MAN"

A.D. 29. Age 32. *Cesarea Philippi*.

Matthew 16, 13-28: Mark 8, 27-38; 9, 1: Luke 9, 18-27. <span
id="fr_46"></span>[\*](#fn_44.md)

JESUS, and his disciples, came into the towns of Cesarea Philippi. And
by the way he asked them, <span id="fr_47"></span>[\*](#fn_44.md)

<div class="jesussaid">

Whom do men say that I, the Son of man, am? Whom say the people that I
am?

</div>

They answering said, John the Baptist; but some *say*, Elias; and
others, Jeremias, or, that one of the old prophets is risen again. Jesus
said,

<div class="jesussaid">

But whom say ye that I am?

</div>

Simon Peter answering said, The Christ of God. <span
id="fr_48"></span>[†](#fn_45.md) Jesus saith unto Peter,

<div class="jesussaid">

Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-jona: for flesh and blood hath not revealed
*it* unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven.

And I say unto thee, That thou art Peter, <span
id="fr_49"></span>[‡](#fn_46.md) and upon this rock I will build my church;
and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.

And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven: and
whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth, shall be bound in heaven; and
whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.

</div>

And he straitly charged them that they should tell no man of him: that
he was Jesus the Christ.

¶From that time forth began Jesus to shew unto his disciples, how that
he, the Son of man, must go unto Jerusalem, and be killed, saying,

<div class="jesussaid">

The Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected of the elders
and chief priests and scribes, and be slain, and be raised the third
day.

</div>

<span id="page_57">p. 57</span>

He spake that saying openly. Then Peter began to rebuke him, saying, Be
it far from thee, Lord: this shall not be unto thee.

When Jesus had turned and looked on his disciples, he rebuked Peter,
saying,

<div class="jesussaid">

Get thee behind me, Satan: thou are an offence <span
id="fr_50"></span>[\*](#fn_47.md) unto me: for thou savorest not the things
that be of God, but the things that be of men.

</div>

¶When he had called the people *unto him*, with his disciples also, he
said unto them,

<div class="jesussaid">

If any man will come after me, whosoever will, let him deny himself, and
take up his cross daily, and follow me.

For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: but whosoever will lose
his life for my sake and the gospel's, the same shall save it. For what
shall it profit a man, what is a man advantaged, if he gain the whole
world, and lose himself, lose his own soul? or be cast away? Or what
shall a man give in exchange for his soul? For the Son of man shall come
in the glory of his Father with his angels; and then he shall reward
every man according to his works.

Whosoever therefore shall be ashamed of me and of my words, in this
adulterous and sinful generation, of him also shall the Son of man be
ashamed, when he shall come in his own glory: and cometh in the glory of
his Father with his holy angels.

</div>

And he said,

<div class="jesussaid">

But I tell you of a truth, there be some standing here which shall not
taste of death, till they have seen the kingdom of God come with power,
the Son of man coming in his kingdom.

</div>
