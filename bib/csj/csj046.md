### XLIII

### JOHN ANSWERED: "FORBID HIM NOT"—SALT—"HAVE PEACE WITH ONE ANOTHER"

A.D. 29. Age 32 *Capernaum*.

Mark 9, 38-50: Luke 9, 49-50.

JOHN <span id="fr_54"></span>[‡](#fn_51) said, Master, we saw one
casting out devils in thy name: and we forbade him, because he followeth
not with us. But Jesus said,

<div class="jesussaid">

Forbid *him* not: for there is no man which shall do a miracle in my
name, that can lightly speak evil of me. For he that is not against us
is for us, is on our part.

For whosoever shall give you a cup of water to drink in my name,

</div>

<span id="page_61">p. 61</span>

<div class="jesussaid">

because ye belong to Christ, verily I say unto you, he shall not lose
his reward.

And whosoever shall offend one of *these* little ones that believe in
me, it is better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck,
and he were cast into the sea.

And if thy hand offend thee, cut it off: it is better for thee to enter
into life maimed, than having two hands to go into hell, into the fire
that never shall be quenched: where their worm dieth not, and the fire
is not quenched.

And if thy foot offend thee, cut it off: it is better for thee to enter
halt into life, than having two feet to be cast into hell, into the fire
that never shall be quenched: where their worm dieth not, and the fire
is not quenched.

And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out: it is better for thee to
enter into the kingdom of God with one eye, than having two eyes to be
cast into hell fire: where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not
quenched.

For every one shall be salted with fire, and every sacrifice shall be
salted with salt. Salt *is* good: but if the salt have lost his
saltness, wherewith will ye season it? Have salt in yourselves, and have
peace one with another.

</div>
