### VI

### JOHN ANSWERS THE PRIESTS—"BEHOLD THE LAMB OF GOD"—JESUS HAILS ANDREW, SIMON, PHILIP, AND NATHANAEL

A.D. 27 Age 30. *Bethabara*

John, 1, 19-20 . . . 22-29 . . . 37-51.

JOHN, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him,
Who art thou? confessed, I am not the Christ. I *am* the voice of one
crying in the wilderness, Make straight the way of the Lord.

They asked him, Why baptizest thou then, if thou be not that Christ?

John answered, I baptize with water: but there standeth one among you,
whom ye know not; he it is, who coming after me is preferred before me,
whose shoe's latchet I am not worthy to unloose.

These things were done in Bethabara beyond Jordan, where John was
baptizing.

¶The next day after, John stood, and two of his disciples; and looking
upon Jesus as he walked, he saith, Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh
away the sin of the world.

The two disciples heard John speak, and they followed Jesus. He saw them
following, and saith,

<div class="jesussaid">

What seek ye?

</div>

They answered, Rabbi (which is to say, Master), where dwellest thou?
Jesus saith,

<div class="jesussaid">

Come and see.

</div>

They came and saw where he dwelt, and they abode with him that day. One
of the two was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother. He first findeth Simon,
and saith unto him, We have found the Messias. <span
id="fr_3"></span>[\*](#fn_3.md)

Andrew brought Simon to Jesus. And when Jesus beheld Simon, he said,

<div class="jesussaid">

Thou art Simon the son of Jona: thou shalt be called Cephas.

</div>

Cephas is, by interpretation, A stone. <span id="fr_4"></span>[†](#fn_4.md)

¶The day following, Jesus would go forth into Galilee, and findeth
Philip: he was of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Simon Peter. And
Jesus saith unto Philip,

<span id="page_10">p. 10</span>

<div class="jesussaid">

Follow me.

</div>

Philip findeth Nathanael, and saith unto him, We have found him of whom
Moses did write, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph. And Nathanael
said, Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth? Philip said, Come
and see.

Jesus saw Nathanael coming, and saith of him,

<div class="jesussaid">

Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile!

</div>

Nathanael saith, Whence knowest thou me? Jesus answered,

<div class="jesussaid">

Before that Philip called thee, when thou wart under the fig tree, I saw
thee.

</div>

Nathanael answered, Master, thou art the Son of God; thou art the King
of Israel. Jesus said,

<div class="jesussaid">

Because I said unto thee, I saw thee under the fig tree, believest thou?
thou shalt see greater things than these. Verily, verily, I say unto
you, Hereafter ye shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending
and descending upon the Son of man.

</div>

<span id="fn_3"></span>[9:\*](csj009.htm#fr_3.md) ". . . which is, being
interpreted, the Christ."

<span id="fn_4"></span>[9:†](csj009.htm#fr_4.md) The Revised Version has
it: ". . . which is by interpretation, Peter." Both words, Peter and
Cephas, have the meaning, rock, stone.
