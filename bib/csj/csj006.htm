<p>THE child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, filled with wisdom: and the grace of God was upon him.</p>  
<p>Now his parents went to Jerusalem every year at the feast of the passover. When Jesus was twelve years old, they went up to Jerusalem after the custom of the feast.</p>  
<p>They fulfilled the days, <i>and</i> as they returned, the child Jesus tarried behind in Jerusalem; and Joseph and his mother knew not <i>of it</i>. They, supposing him to have been in the company, went a day's journey and [then] they sought him among <i>their</i> kinsfolk and acquaintance. When they found him not, they turned back to Jerusalem, seeking him.</p>  
<p>After three days they found him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the doctors, both hearing them, and asking questions. All that heard him were astonished at his understanding and answers.</p>  
<p>His mother said unto him, Son, why hast thou thus dealt with us? behold, thy father and I have sought thee sorrowing. Jesus said unto them,</p>  
<p><div class="jesussaid">How is it that ye sought me? wist ye not that I must be about my Father's business?</div></p>  
<p>And they understood not.</p>  
<p>He went down with them to Nazareth, and was subject into them: but his mother kept all these sayings in her heart.</p>  
<p>And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and man.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2"></A><A HREF="#fn_2"><FONT SIZE="1">*</FONT></A></p>
