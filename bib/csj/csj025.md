### XXII

### THE CENTURION'S SERVANT HEALED—THE WIDOW'S SON RESTORED

A.D. 28. Age 31. *Capernaum. Nain*.

Matthew 8, 5-13: Luke 7, 11-18.

WHEN Jesus was entered into Capernaum, there came unto him a centurion
beseeching him, saying, Lord, my servant lieth at home sick of the
palsy, grievously tormented.

The elders of the Jews came, saying, That he was worthy: for he loveth
our nation, and hath built us a synagogue.

And Jesus saith unto the centurion,

<div class="jesussaid">

I will come and heal him.

</div>

The centurion answered, Lord, I am not worthy that thou shouldest come
under my roof: but speak the word only, and my servant shall be healed.
Jesus marvelled, and turned and said to the people that followed him,

<div class="jesussaid">

Verily I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in
Israel. And I say unto you, That many shall come from the east and west,
and shall sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of
heaven: but the children of the kingdom shall be cast out into outer
darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.

</div>

And Jesus said unto the centurion,

<div class="jesussaid">

Go thy way; and as thou hast believed, *so* be it done unto thee.

</div>

His servant was healed in the selfsame hour. <span

¶The day after, Jesus went into a city called Nain: many of his
disciples, and much people went with him.

Now when he came nigh to the gate of the city, behold, there was a dead
man carried out, the only son of a widow: much people of the city was
with her. The Lord had compassion on her, and said,

<div class="jesussaid">

Weep not.

</div>

He touched the bier, and they that bare *him* stood still. Jesus said,

<div class="jesussaid">

Young man, I say unto thee, Arise.

</div>

And he that was dead sat up, and began to speak.

There came a fear on all: they glorified God, saying, A great prophet is
risen among us.

This rumor of Jesus went forth throughout all Judea and the region round
about. And the disciples of John shewed him \[John the Baptist\] of all
these things.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_23"></span>[32:\*](csj025.htm#fr_24) Luke (7, 2-10) goes
further into details regarding the centurion than does Matthew (above),
but does not quote Jesus so fully.
