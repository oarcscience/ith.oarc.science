<p>JESUS going up to Jerusalem took again the disciples apart in the way, and began to tell them what things should happen unto him, <i>saying</i>,</p>  
<p><div class="jesussaid">Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man shall be betrayed and delivered unto the chief priests, and unto the scribes; and he shall be spitefully entreated and spitted on; and they shall condemn him to death, and shall deliver him unto the Gentiles.</p>  
<p>They shall mock him, and shall scourge him, and shall crucify and kill him: and the third day he shall rise again.</p>  
<p>And all the things that are written by the prophets concerning the Son of man shall be accomplished.</div></p>  
<p>They (the twelve) understood none of this saying; neither knew they the things which were spoken.</p>  
<p>&para;Then came unto Jesus the mother of James and John, the sons of Zebedee, desiring a certain thing of him.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_78"></A><A HREF="#fn_75"><FONT SIZE="1">*</FONT></A> He said unto her,</p>  
<p><div class="jesussaid">What wilt thou?</p>  
<p>And he said unto them,</p>  
<p>What would ye that I should do for you?</div></p>  
<p>She saith, Grant that these my two sons may sit, the one on thy right hand, and the other on the left, in glory in thy kingdom. But Jesus said <i>unto them</i>,</p>  
<p><div class="jesussaid">Ye know not what ye ask: are ye able to drink of the cup that I shall drink of, and to be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?</div></p>  
<p>And they say, We can. Jesus answered,</p>  
<p><div class="jesussaid">Ye shall drink indeed of my cup, the cup that I drink of: and with the baptism that I am baptized withal ye shall be baptized: but to sit</div></p>

<p><div class="jesussaid">on my right hand and on my left hand, is not mine to give, but <i>it shall be given to them</i> for whom it is prepared of my Father.</div></p>  
<p>The ten were moved with indignation against the two brethren. But Jesus called them to <i>him</i>, and said,</p>  
<p><div class="jesussaid">Ye know that the princes of the Gentiles exercise dominion over them; ye know that they which are accounted to rule over the Gentiles exercise lordship over them; and their great ones exercise authority upon them.</p>  
<p>But so shall it not be among you: but whosoever will be great among you, shall be your minister: and whosoever of you will be the chiefest, shall be servant of all: let him be your servant, even as the Son of man: for even the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.</div></p>
