### XLI

### JESUS TRANSFIGURED—MOSES AND ELIAS APPEAR—A LUNATIC CURED: "HELP THOU MINE UNBELIEF"

A.D. 29 Age 32. *On, and near, Mt. Hermon*.

Luke 9, 28-42: Matthew 17, 1-21: Mark 9, 2-29.

IT came to pass, about an eight <span id="fr_51"></span>[†](#fn_48.md) days
after these sayings, Jesus taketh Peter, John, and James his brother,
and went up into a high mountain apart to pray: and Jesus was
transfigured before them.

As he prayed, the fashion of his countenance was altered: his face did
shine as the sun, and his raiment was white as the light, and
glistering, shining as snow, exceeding white, so as no fuller on earth
can white them. And, behold, two men, Moses and Elias: who appeared in
glory: talking

<span id="page_58">p. 58</span>

with Jesus \[they\] spake of his decease which he should accomplish at
Jerusalem.

Peter and they that were with Jesus saw his glory, and the two men with
Jesus.

There came a bright cloud, and overshadowed them: and a voice out of the
cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear
ye him.

The disciples fell on their face, and were sore afraid. Jesus came and
touched them, and said,

<div class="jesussaid">

Arise, and be not afraid.

</div>

Suddenly, when they had lifted up their eyes, they saw no man any more,
save Jesus only. And he charged them,

<div class="jesussaid">

Tell the vision to no man, until the Son of man be risen again from the
dead.

</div>

¶Questioning with one another what the rising from the dead should mean,
his disciples asked Jesus, Why say the scribes that Elias must first
come? Jesus told them,

<div class="jesussaid">

Elias verily cometh first, and restoreth all things; and how it is
written of the Son of man, that he must suffer many things, and be set
at nought.

But I say unto you, That Elias is indeed come already, and they knew him
not; and they have done unto him whatsoever they listed, as it is
written of him.

Likewise shall also the Son of man suffer of them.

</div>

The disciples understood that he spake of John the Baptist. They kept it
close, and told no man in those days any of the things which they had
seen.

¶When Jesus saw a multitude about *his* disciples, and the scribes
questioning with them, he asked the scribes,

<div class="jesussaid">

What question ye with them?

</div>

One of the multitude answered, Master, I have brought unto thee my son:
Lord, have mercy; for he is lunatic, and sore vexed: ofttimes he falleth
into the fire, and oft into the water. A spirit teareth him that he
foameth again, and gnasheth his teeth, and pineth away. I brought him to
thy disciples, and they could not cure him. He is mine only child.

Then Jesus said,

<div class="jesussaid">

O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you? How
long shall I suffer you?

Bring thy son hither to me.

</div>

<span id="page_59">p. 59</span>

They brought him: and as he was yet a coming, the spirit tare him; and
he fell, and wallowed foaming. Jesus asked his father,

<div class="jesussaid">

How long is it ago since this came unto him?

</div>

He said, Of a child. Have compassion on us. Jesus said,

<div class="jesussaid">

If thou canst believe, all things *are* possible to him that believeth.

</div>

Straightway the father said with tears, Lord, I believe; help thou my
unbelief.

Jesus rebuked the foul spirit, saying,

<div class="jesussaid">

*Thou* dumb and deaf spirit, I charge thee, come out of him, and enter
no more into him.

</div>

The child was cured from that very hour.

¶When Jesus was come into the house, his disciples asked him privately,
Why could not we cast him out? Jesus answered,

<div class="jesussaid">

Because of your unbelief: for verily I say unto you, If ye have faith as
a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say unto this mountain, Remove hence;
and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible unto you. Howbeit
this kind goeth not out, can come forth, by nothing, but by prayer and
fasting.

</div>
