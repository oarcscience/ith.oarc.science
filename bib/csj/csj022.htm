<p align="center">A.D. 28. Age 31. <i>Capernaum</i>.</p>  
<p align="center"><FONT SIZE="-1">Matthew 12, 1-16: Mark 2, 23-28; 3, 1-15; 22-29: Luke 6, 1-13; 11, 24-26.</FONT></p>  
<p>AT that time Jesus went on the sabbath day through the cornfields; and his disciples were a hungered, and began, as they went, to pluck the ears of corn, and to eat, rubbing <i>them</i> with <i>their</i> hands.</p>  
<p>But certain of the Pharisees said unto Jesus, Behold, why do thy disciples on the sabbath day that which is not lawful? Jesus said unto them,</p>  
<p><div class="jesussaid">Have ye never read so much as this: what David did, when himself was a hungered, and had need, he, and they which were with him: how he went into the house of God in the days of Abiathar the high priest, and did take and eat the shewbread, and gave also to them which were with him, which was not lawful for him to eat, neither for them which were with him, but for the priests alone?</p>  
<p>Or have ye not read in the law, how that on the sabbath days the priests in the temple profane the sabbath, and are blameless?</p>  
<p>But I say unto you, That in this place is <i>one</i> greater than the temple. But if ye had known what <i>this</i> meaneth, I will have mercy, and not sacrifice, ye would not have condemned the guiltless.</p>  
<p>The sabbath was made for man, and not man for the sabbath: therefore the Son of man is Lord even of the sabbath day.</div></p>

<p>&para;On another sabbath, Jesus entered into the synagogue and taught.</p>  
<p>There was a man there whose right hand was withered. The scribes and Pharisees watched Jesus, whether he would heal on the sabbath day. But he knew their thoughts, and he said to the man,</p>  
<p><div class="jesussaid">Rise up, and stand forth in the midst.</div></p>  
<p>He arose and stood forth. Then said Jesus unto them,</p>  
<p><div class="jesussaid">I will ask you one thing: Is it lawful on the sabbath days to do good, or to do evil? to save life, or to kill? to save life, or to destroy it?</div></p>  
<p>But thy held their peace. And Jesus said,</p>  
<p><div class="jesussaid">What man shall there be among you, that shall have one sheep, and if it fall into a pit on the sabbath day, will he not lay hold on it, and lift it out? How much then is a man better than a sheep? Wherefore it is lawful to do well on the sabbath days.</div></p>  
<p>When Jesus had looked round about on them with anger, being grieved for the hardness of their hearts, he saith unto the man,</p>  
<p><div class="jesussaid">Stretch forth thine hand.</div></p>  
<p>He did so: and his hand was restored whole, like as the other.</p>  
<p>&para;The Pharisees were filled with madness; they went forth, and straightaway took counsel with the Herodians what they might do to Jesus.</p>  
<p>Jesus knew it: he withdrew himself with his disciples to the sea. And he straitly charged them that they should not make him known.</p>  
<p>&para;Jesus goeth up into a mountain, and calleth <i>unto</i> him whom he would: and they came. He ordained twelve, whom also he named apostles, that they should be with him, and that he might send them forth to preach, and to have power to heal sicknesses, and to cast out devils.</p>  
<p>&para;The scribes said, He hath Beelzebub, and by the prince of devils casteth he out devils. Jesus said unto them in parables,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_20"></A><A HREF="#fn_19"><FONT SIZE="1">*</FONT></A></p>  
<p><div class="jesussaid">How can Satan cast out Satan?</p>  
<p>And if a kingdom be divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand. And if a house be divided against itself, that house cannot stand. And if Satan rise up against himself, and be divided, he cannot stand, but hath an end.</p>  
<p>No man can enter into a strong man's house, and spoil his goods, except he will first bind the strong man; and then he will spoil his house.</p>  
<p>Verily I say unto you, All sins shall be forgiven unto the sons of men, and blasphemies wherewith soever they shall blaspheme: but he that shall blaspheme against the Holy Ghost hath never forgiveness, but is in danger of eternal damnation.</div></p>

<p>Because they said, he hath an unclean spirit.</p>  
<p><div class="jesussaid">&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_21"></A><A HREF="#fn_20"><FONT SIZE="1">*</FONT></A>When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh through dry places, seeking rest: and finding none, he saith, I will return unto my house whence I came out. And when he cometh, he findeth <i>it</i> swept and garnished. Then goeth he, and taketh <i>to him</i> seven other spirits more wicked than himself; and the last <i>state</i> of that man is worse than the first.</div></p>
