### XXXVIII

### SYROPHENICIAN'S DAUGHTER HEALED—A DEAF MUTE HEARS AND TALKS

A.D. 29. Age 32. *Phenicia*. *Decapolis*.

Matthew 15, 21-28: Mark 7, 24-36.

FROM thence Jesus went into the borders of Tyre and Sidon.

And, behold, a woman of Canaan came out of the same coasts, and cried
unto him, saying, Have mercy on me, O Lord, *thou* Son of David: my
daughter is grievously vexed with an unclean spirit.

The woman was a Greek, a Syrophenician by nation.

Jesus answered her not a word. And his disciples came, saying, Send her
away. Jesus said,

<div class="jesussaid">

I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel.

</div>

He entered into a house, and would have no man know *it:* but he could
not be hid. For then came she whose young daughter had an unclean
spirit, saying, Lord, help me.

But Jesus said unto her,

<div class="jesussaid">

Let the children first be filled: for it is not meet to take the
children's bread, and to cast *it* unto the dogs.

</div>

She said, Yes, Lord: yet the dogs under the table eat of the children's
crumbs which fall from their masters' table. Jesus answered,

<span id="page_54">p. 54</span>

<div class="jesussaid">

O woman, great *is* thy faith: be it unto thee even as thou wilt. For
this saying go thy way; the devil is gone out of thy daughter.

</div>

Her daughter was made whole from that very hour.

¶Departing from the coasts of Tyre and Sidon, Jesus came unto the sea of
Galilee, through the midst of the coasts of Decapolis.

They bring unto him one that was deaf, and had an impediment in his
speech. Jesus took him aside, and put his fingers into his ears, and
touched his tongue; and looking up to heaven, he sighed, and saith,

<div class="jesussaid">

Be opened.

</div>

Straightway his ears were opened, and the string of his tongue was
loosed, and he spake plain.

Jesus charged them that they should tell no man: but the more he charged
them, so much the more a great deal they published *it*.
