### LXXXVI

### CASTING LOTS FOR THE SAVIOR'S CLOTHES—THE PENITENT THIEF REWARDED—CHRIST'S FILIAL FAREWELL TO HIS MOTHER—"IT IS FINISHED"

A.D. 30. Age 33. *Jerusalem. Golgotha: Calvary*.

Matthew 27, 39-56: Mark 15, 29-41: Luke 23, 35-49: John 19, 23-30.

THE soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took his garments, and made
four parts, to every soldier a part: casting lots upon them.

The people that passed by derided *him*, wagging their heads, and
saying, Ah, thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest *it* in three
days, save thyself!

The soldiers also mocked him, saying, If thou be the King of the Jews,
save thyself!

Likewise the chief priests mocking said among themselves with the
scribes, He saved others; himself he cannot save!

One of the two thieves which were crucified with him cast the same in
his teeth; but the other rebuked him, saying, Dost thou not fear God? We
receive the due reward of our deeds: but this man hath done nothing
amiss.

And he said unto Jesus, Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy
kingdom.

Jesus said unto him,

<div class="jesussaid">

Verily I say unto thee, To day shalt thou be with me in paradise.

</div>

¶Now there stood by the cross Jesus’ mother, and his mother's sister;
Mary the *wife* of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene. Jesus saw his mother,
and the disciple standing by, whom he loved: <span
id="fr_105"></span>[\*](#fn_101.md) and he saith unto his mother,

<div class="jesussaid">

Woman, behold thy son!

</div>

Then saith he to the disciple,

<div class="jesussaid">

Behold thy mother!

</div>

And from that hour that disciple took her unto his own *home*.

¶Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land until the
ninth hour. At the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying,

<div class="jesussaid">

My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?

</div>

After this, Jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished, saith,

<div class="jesussaid">

I thirst.

</div>

<span id="page_137">p. 137</span>

Straightway one of them ran, and filled a sponge with vinegar, put *it*
upon hysop (on a reed), and put it to Jesus’ mouth. When he had received
the vinegar, he said,

<div class="jesussaid">

It is finished.

</div>

And when he had cried again with a loud voice, he said,

<div class="jesussaid">

Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit!

</div>

Having said thus, Jesus bowed his head, and yielded up the ghost.

¶All his acquaintance stood afar off, beholding these things. There were
also women looking on: among which was Mary Magdalene; and Mary the
mother of James the less and of Joses; and Salome the mother of
Zebedee's children; and many other women which came up with Jesus into
Jerusalem.
