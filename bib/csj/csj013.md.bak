### CHRIST IN CANA CURES NOBLEMAN'S SON AT CAPERNAUM

A.D. 27. Age 30. *Galilee: Cana* (*again*).

John 4, 43-53.

AFTER two days Jesus went into Galilee: for Jesus himself testified,
that a prophet hath no honor in his own country.

The Galileans received him, having seen all the things that he did at
Jerusalem at the feast: for they also went unto the feast.

So Jesus came again into Cana of Galilee, where he \[had\] made the
water wine.

And there was a certain nobleman, whose son was sick at Capernaum. He
went unto Jesus, and besought him that he would come down, and heal his
son: for he was at the point of death. Then said Jesus unto him,

<div class="jesussaid">

Except ye see signs and wonders, ye will not believe.

</div>

The nobleman saith, Sir, come down ere my child die. Jesus answered,

<span id="page_15">p. 15</span>

<div class="jesussaid">

Go thy way: thy son liveth.

</div>

The man believed, and went his way. And going down, his servants met
him, and told *him*, Thy son liveth.

Then inquired he of them the hour when the child began to amend. They
said, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.

So the father knew that *it* was at the same hour, in the which Jesus
said unto him, Thy son liveth.
