### LXXIII

### PARABLE: THE MASTER, THE SERVANTS, THE MONEY (TALENTS)—ON THE LAST JUDGMENT: "WHEN THE SON OF MAN SHALL COME"

A.D. 30. Age 33. *Mount of Olives*.

Matthew 25, 14-46.

<div class="jesussaid">

 <span id="fr_93"></span>[\*](#fn_89.md)FOR *the kingdom of heaven is* as a
man travelling into a far country, *who* called his own servants, and
delivered unto them his goods. And unto one he gave five talents, to
another, two, and to another, one; to every man according to his several
ability; and straightway took his journey.

Then he that had received the five talents went and traded with the
same, and made *them* other five talents. And likewise he that *had
received* two, he also gained other two. But he that had received one
went and digged in the earth, and hid his lord's money.

After a long time the lord of those servants cometh, and reckoned with
them.

And so he that had received five talents came and brought other five
talents, saying, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me five talents: behold, I
have gained beside them five talents more. His lord said unto him, Well
done, *thou* good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a
few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the
joy of thy lord.

He also that had received two talents came and said, Lord, thou
deliveredst unto me two talents: behold, I have gained two other talents
beside them. His lord said unto him, Well done, good and faithful
servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee
ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.

<div class="jesussaid">

Then he which had received the one talent came and said, Lord, I knew
thee that thou art a hard man, reaping where thou hast not sown, and
gathering where thou hast not strewed; and I was afraid, and went and
hid thy talent in the earth: lo, *there* thou hast *that is* thine.

His lord answered and said unto him, *Thou* wicked and slothful servant,
thou knewest that I reap where I sowed not, and gather where I have not
strewed: Thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the exchangers,
and *then* at my coming I should have received mine own with usury.

Take therefore the talent from him, and give *it* unto him which hath
ten talents.

For unto every one that hath shall be given, and he shall have
abundance: but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that
which he hath. And cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness:
there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.

¶When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels
with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory: and before him
shall be gathered all nations: and he shall separate them one from
another, as a shepherd divideth *his* sheep from the goats: and he shall
set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left.

Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of
my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of
the world: for I was a hungered, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and
ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in: naked, and ye
clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was in prison, and ye came
unto me.

Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee a
hungered, and fed *thee?* or thirsty, and gave *thee* drink? When saw we
thee a stranger, and took *thee* in? or naked, and clothed *thee?* Or
when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee?

And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you,
Inasmuch as ye have done *it* unto one of the least of these my
brethren, ye have done *it* unto me.

Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye
cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels:
for I was a hungered, and ye gave me no meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave
me no drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me not in: naked, and ye
clothed me not; sick, and in prison, and ye visited me not.

Then shall they also answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee a
hungered, or athirst, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison,
and did not minister unto thee?

Then he shall answer them, saying, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye
did *it* not to one of the least of these, ye did *it* not to me.

And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the righteous
into life eternal.
