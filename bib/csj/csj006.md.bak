### THE BOY JESUS: AT TWELVE, VISITS JERUSALEM—TARRIES BEHIND—TALKS IN TEMPLE WITH THE DOCTORS—SPEAKS TO HIS MOTHER HIS FIRST RECORDED WORDS

A.D. 8. Age 12. *Nazareth. Jerusalem*

Luke 2, 40-52.

THE child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, filled with wisdom: and the
grace of God was upon him.

Now his parents went to Jerusalem every year at the feast of the
passover. When Jesus was twelve years old, they went up to Jerusalem
after the custom of the feast.

They fulfilled the days, *and* as they returned, the child Jesus tarried
behind in Jerusalem; and Joseph and his mother knew not *of it*. They,
supposing him to have been in the company, went a day's journey and
\[then\] they sought him among *their* kinsfolk and acquaintance. When
they found him not, they turned back to Jerusalem, seeking him.

After three days they found him in the temple, sitting in the midst of
the doctors, both hearing them, and asking questions. All that heard him
were astonished at his understanding and answers.

His mother said unto him, Son, why hast thou thus dealt with us? behold,
thy father and I have sought thee sorrowing. Jesus said unto them,

<div class="jesussaid">

How is it that ye sought me? wist ye not that I must be about my
Father's business?

</div>

And they understood not.

He went down with them to Nazareth, and was subject into them: but his
mother kept all these sayings in her heart.

And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and
man. <span id="fr_2"></span>[\*](#fn_2.md)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_2"></span>[7:\*](csj006.htm#fr_2.md) Note that the curtain
drops here, as it were, on the drama of Jesus at the age of twelve, not
to rise again till the age of thirty.
