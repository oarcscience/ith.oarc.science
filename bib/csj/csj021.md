### MATTHEW (LEVI) CALLED—HIS BANQUET—THE WHOLE NEED NOT A PHYSICIAN—JOHN'S DISCIPLES FAST: CHRIST'S FAST NOT—TWO PARABLES: OLD GARMENT, NEW WINE

A.D. 28, Age 31. *Capernaum*.

Luke 5, 27-39; Matthew 9, 9-17; Mark 2, 13-22.

JESUS went forth again by the sea side; and the multitudes resorted unto
him, and he taught them.

¶As he passed forth from thence, he saw a man, named Matthew (Levi, a
publican <span id="fr_16"></span>[\*](#fn_15)), sitting at the receipt
of custom: he said unto him,

<div class="jesussaid">

Follow me.

</div>

And he rose up, left all, and followed Jesus.

¶Levi made him a great feast <span id="fr_17"></span>[†](#fn_16) in his
own house: and, behold, many publicans and others sat at meat with Jesus
and his disciples.

But their scribes and Pharisees murmured against his disciples, saying,
Why do ye eat with publicans and sinners? Why eateth your master with
publicans and sinners?

When Jesus heard *that*, he saith unto them,

<div class="jesussaid">

They that be whole need not a physician, but they that are sick. But go
ye and learn what *that* meaneth. I will have mercy, and not
sacrifice: <span id="fr_18"></span>[‡](#fn_17) for I am not come to call
the righteous, but sinners to repentance.

</div>

¶The disciples of John used to fast often: and they come and say unto
Jesus, Why do thy disciples fast not? Jesus said unto them,

<span id="page_27">p. 27</span>

<div class="jesussaid">

Can ye make the children of the bridechamber fast, while the bridegroom
is with them? as long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot
fast. But the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken away
from them, and then shall they fast in those days.

</div>

¶And he spake also a parable unto them,

<div class="jesussaid">

No man also seweth a piece of new cloth upon an old garment; else the
new piece that filleth it up agreeth not with the old: it taketh away
from the old, and the rent is made worse.

</div>

Another parable put he forth.

<div class="jesussaid">

And no man putteth new wine into old bottles:  <span
id="fr_19"></span>[\*](csj022.htm#fn_18)else the bottles will be marred:
the new wine will burst the bottles, and be spilled, and the bottles
shall perish. But new wine must be put into new bottles; and both are
preserved.

No man also having drunk old *wine* straightway desireth new; for he
saith, The old is better.

</div>

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_15"></span>[26:\*](csj021.htm#fr_16) *publican:* a
taxgatherer.

<span id="fn_16"></span>[26:†](csj021.htm#fr_17) The three accounts of
Levi's feast (particularly of the bridechamber parable) exhibit
interesting variations of text: Luke 5, 29-39; Mark 2, 15-22; Matthew 9,
10-17.

<span id="fn_17"></span>[26:‡](csj021.htm#fr_18) Hosea 6. 6.
