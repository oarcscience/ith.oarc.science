### XXXV

### JESUS WOULD NOT BE MADE KING—WALKS ON THE SEA—DOUBTING PETER'S ADVENTURE—JESUS EXALTS FAITH

A.D. 29. Age 32. *Sea of Galilee*. *Gennesaret*.

Matthew 14, 22-32: Mark 6, 45-53: John 6, 15-21.

WHEN Jesus perceived that they would take him by force, to make him a
king, he constrained his disciples to get into a ship, and to go before
him unto the other side, while he sent the multitude away.

If He went up into a mountain apart, to pray: when the evening was come,
he was there alone.

His disciples went over the sea toward Capernaum. The sea arose by
reason of a great wind that blew. It was now dark, and the ship in the
midst of the sea, tossed with the waves, and Jesus on the land, alone.

He saw them toiling in rowing; and about the fourth watch of the night,
they see Jesus walking on the sea, and drawing nigh unto the ship. They
cried out for fear, saying, It is a spirit.

But straightway Jesus spake,

<div class="jesussaid">

Be of good cheer; it is I: be not afraid.

</div>

Peter answered, Lord, if it be thou, bid me come unto thee on the water.
Jesus said,

<div class="jesussaid">

Come.

</div>

And Peter walked on the water, to go to Jesus. But he was afraid; and
beginning to sink, he cried, Lord, save me.

Jesus stretched forth *his* hand, and caught him, and said,

<div class="jesussaid">

O thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt?

</div>

When they were come into the ship, the wind ceased. They came into the
land of Gennesaret.
