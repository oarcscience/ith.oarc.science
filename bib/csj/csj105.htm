<p><div class="jesussaid">AND unto the angel of the church of the Laodiceans write;</p>  
<p>These things saith the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the beginning of the creation of God;</p>  
<p>I know thy works, that thou art neither cold nor hot: I would thou wert cold or hot. So then because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will spew thee out of my mouth. Because thou sayest, I am rich, and increased with goods, and have need of nothing; and knowest not that thou art wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked: I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire,</div></p>

<p><div class="jesussaid">that thou mayest be rich; and white raiment, that thou mayest be clothed, and <i>that</i> the shame of thy nakedness do not appear; and anoint thine eyes with eyesalve, that thou mayest see.</p>  
<p>As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten; be zealous, therefore, and repent.</p>  
<p>Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me.</p>  
<p>To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father in his throne.</div></p>  
<p>He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches.</p>
