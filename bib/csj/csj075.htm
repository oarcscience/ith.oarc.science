<p align="center">A.D. 30. Age 33. <i>Mount of Olives</i>.</p>

<p><div class="jesussaid">&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_90"></A><A HREF="#fn_86"><FONT SIZE="1">*</FONT></A>NOW learn a parable of the fig tree: Behold the fig tree when her branch is yet tender, and putteth forth leaves; and behold the trees when they now shoot forth: ye see and know of your own selves that summer is nigh at hand.</p>  
<p>So in like manner, when ye shall see all these things come to pass, know ye that the kingdom of God is nigh at hand, <i>even</i> at the doors. Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass, till all these things be done. Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away.</p>  
<p>&para;And take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting and drunkenness, and cares of this life; and so</div></p>

<p><div class="jesussaid">that day come upon you unawares. For as a snare shall it come on all them that dwell on the face of the whole earth.</p>  
<p>Watch ye therefore, and pray always, that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass, and to stand before the Son of man.</p>  
<p>&para;But of that day and that hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels which are in heaven, neither the Son, but my Father only.</p>  
<p>Take ye heed, watch and pray: for ye know not when the time is. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_91"></A><A HREF="#fn_87"><FONT SIZE="1">*</FONT></A>But as the days of Noe <i>were</i>, so shall also the coming of the Son of man be. For as in the days that were before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark, and knew not till the flood came, and took them all away: so shall also the coming of the Son of man be. Then shall two be in the field; the one shall be taken, and the other left. Two <i>women shall be</i> grinding at the mill; the one shall be taken, and the other left.</p>  
<p>&para;Watch therefore: for ye know not what hour your Lord doth come.</p>  
<p><i>For the Son of man is</i> as a man taking a far journey, who left his house, and gave authority to his servants, and to every man his work, and commanded the porter to watch.</p>  
<p>Watch ye therefore: for ye know not when the master of the house cometh, at even, or at midnight, or at the cockcrowing, or in the morning: lest coming suddenly he find you sleeping.</p>  
<p>And what I say unto you I say unto all, Watch.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_92"></A><A HREF="#fn_88"><FONT SIZE="1">&#8224;</FONT></A>But know this, that if the goodman of the house had known in what watch the thief would come, he would have watched, and would not have suffered his house to be broken up. Therefore be ye also ready: for in such an hour as ye think not the Son of man cometh. And what I say unto you I say unto all, Watch.</p>  
<p>Who then is a faithful and wise servant, whom his lord hath made ruler over his household, to give them meat in due season?</p>  
<p>Blessed <i>is</i> that servant, whom his lord when he cometh shall find so doing. Verily I say unto you, That he shall make him ruler over all his goods.</p>  
<p>But and if that evil servant shall say in his heart, My lord delayeth his coming; and shall begin to smit <i>his</i> fellow servants, and to eat and drink with the drunken; the lord of that servant shall come in a day when he looketh not for <i>him</i>, and in an hour that he is not aware of, and shall cut him asunder, and appoint <i>him</i> his portion with the hypocrites: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</p>  
<p>&para;Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins, which took their lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom. And five of them were wise, and five <i>were</i> foolish. They that <i>were</i> foolish took their</div></p>

<p><div class="jesussaid">lamps, and took no oil with them. But the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps.</p>  
<p>While the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept. And at midnight there was a cry made, Behold, the bridegroom cometh; go ye out to meet him.</p>  
<p>Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps. And the foolish said unto the wise, Give us of your oil; for our lamps are gone out.</p>  
<p>But the wise answered, saying, <i>Not so;</i> lest there be not enough for us and you, but go ye rather to them that sell, and buy for yourselves.</p>  
<p>And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came: and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage: and the door was shut.</p>  
<p>Afterward came also the other virgins, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us. But he answered and said, Verily I say unto you, I know you not.</p>  
<p>Watch, therefore, for ye know neither the day nor the hour wherein the Son of man cometh.</div></p>
