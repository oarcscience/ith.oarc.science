### XLII

### JESUS FORETELLS HIS DEATH AND RESURRECTION—EXHORTS TO HUMILITY—TRIBUTE: THE FISH AND THE COIN

A.D. 29. Age 32. *Galilee*. *Capernaum*.

Mark 9, 30-37: Luke 9, 44-48: Matthew 17, 22-27.

JESUS departed thence, and passed through Galilee. While in Galilee, all
wondered at the things which Jesus did. But while they wondered, Jesus
said unto his disciples,

<div class="jesussaid">

Let these sayings sink down into your ears: for the Son of man shall be
betrayed, and delivered into the hands of men: and they shall kill him;
and the third day after that he is killed, he shall be raised again.

</div>

But they understood not.

¶There arose a reasoning among the disciples: for by the way \[to
Capernaum\] they had disputed amongst themselves which of them should be
the greatest. In the house Jesus asked,

<div class="jesussaid">

What was it that ye disputed among yourselves by the way?

</div>

<span id="page_60">p. 60</span>

But they held their peace: and Jesus, perceiving the thought of their
heart, saith,

<div class="jesussaid">

If any man desire to be first, *the same* shall be last of all.

</div>

He took a child in his arms, and said,

<div class="jesussaid">

Whosoever shall receive this child in my name, receiveth me; whosoever
shall receive one of such children in my name, receiveth me: and
whosoever shall receive me, receiveth me not, but him that sent me: for
he that is least among you all, the same shall be great.

</div>

When they were come to Capernaum, they that received tribute *money*
came to Peter, and said, Doth not your master pay tribute?

Peter saith, Yes. And when he was come into the house, Jesus
prevented <span id="fr_52"></span>[\*](#fn_49.md) him, saying,

<div class="jesussaid">

What thinkest thou, Simon? Of whom do the kings of the earth take custom
or tribute? of their own children, or of strangers?

</div>

Peter saith, of strangers. Jesus answered,

<div class="jesussaid">

Then are the children free.

Notwithstanding, lest we should offend them, go thou to the sea, and
cast a hook, and take up the fish that first cometh up; and when thou
has opened his mouth, thou shalt find a piece of money: that take, and
give unto them for me and thee. <span id="fr_53"></span>[†](#fn_50.md)

</div>
