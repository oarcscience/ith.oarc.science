Like the [Jefferson Bible](../jb/index.md), this is an attempt to edit the
four gospels into a consistent account, in this case focusing on the
words of Jesus. There is plenty of connecting narrative around the
instances where Jesus speaks, so this is better than simply presenting
each quote out of context. The focus on what Jesus is attributed as
saying makes it easier to browse the core texts of the New Testament.
All in all, a very useful reference, and a great read.

PRODUCTION NOTES: In this etext, Jesus' words are highlighted in blue,
slightly larger text. The date and age information was extracted from
the copytext page headers and moved into the file title area in the
online edition.
