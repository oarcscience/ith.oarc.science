### LXV

### THE FIG TREE WITHERED—FAITH EXALTED—PRAYER WITH FAITH EXTOLLED

A.D. 30. Age 33. *Near Bethany*. *Jerusalem*.

Mark 11, 12-26: Matthew 21, 12-13; 18-22: Luke 19, 45-48.

NOW on the morrow in the morning, when they were come from Bethany, as
Jesus returned into the city, he was hungry: and seeing afar off a fig
tree having leaves, he came, if haply he might find any thing thereon.
He found nothing but leaves, for the time of the figs was not *yet*. And
he said,

<div class="jesussaid">

Let no fruit grow on thee henceforward. No man eat fruit of thee
hereafter for ever.

</div>

<span id="page_101">p. 101</span>

Presently the fig tree withered away. The disciples saw it, saying, How
soon is the fig tree withered away! Jesus answered,

<div class="jesussaid">

Verily I say unto you, If ye have faith, and doubt not, ye shall not
only do this *which is done* to the fig tree, but also if ye shall say
to this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; it
shall be done. And all things, whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer,
believing, ye shall receive.

</div>

¶ <span id="fr_83"></span>[\*](#fn_79.md)They came to Jerusalem, and Jesus
went into the temple, and began to cast out them that sold and bought
therein, and overthrew the tables of the money changers, and the seats
of them that sold doves; and would not suffer that any man should carry
*any* vessel through the temple. And he taught, saying,

<div class="jesussaid">

My house is the house of prayer. Is it not written, My house shall be
called of all nations the house of prayer? but ye have made it a den of
thieves.

</div>

The scribes and chief priests heard *it*, and sought how they might
destroy Jesus: for they feared him, because all the people were
attentive to hear him.

When even was come, he went out of the city. In the morning, as they
came by, they saw the fig tree dried up from the roots. And Peter
calling to remembrance saith unto Jesus, Master, behold, the fig tree
which thou cursedst is withered away. Jesus answering saith,

<div class="jesussaid">

Have faith in God. For verily I say unto you, That whosoever shall say
unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; and
shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that those things which
he saith shall come to pass, he shall have whatsoever he saith.

Therefore I say unto you, What things soever ye desire, when ye pray,
believe that ye receive *them*, and ye shall receive *them*.

And when ye stand praying, forgive, if ye have ought against any; that
your Father also which is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses. But
if ye do not forgive, neither will your Father which is in heaven
forgive your trespasses.

</div>

<span id="fn_79"></span>[101:\*](csj068.htm#fr_83.md) There is in John,
also (2, 14-16), a chiding by Jesus of the desecrators of the temple
(turn back to VII of this book).
