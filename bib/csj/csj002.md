*The Complete Sayings of Jesus*, by Arthur Hinds, \[1927\], at
Intangible Textual Heritage

### THE COMPILER'S PURPOSE

THE shelves of the libraries and of the bookstores bend beneath the
tomes of the sayings, the bare sayings, of all the other great men; but
one will not find in library or bookstore, in any published book, the
complete sayings of Jesus, the bare sayings in simple sequence, Christ's
own words, *separate*.

¶This compiler's purpose has been to enable any reader, whether
confirmed Christian or inquiring pagan, or a frankly detached, to get
him a book of <span class="smallcaps">CHRIST'S OWN WORDS</span>,
"divested," so runs the title page, "of the context, *excepting* those
brief portions of the gospel narratives retained to establish the place,
the time, or occasion, or a question the reply to which is the Master's
own answer."

Many a reader, arrived at <span class="smallcaps">FINIS</span> in the
New Testament itself, has but a hazy picture of Christ on his daily
walks as a circuit preacher everywhere within walking distance; has but
a sketchy outline of the times and occasions—so many
biographers!—Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, Paul—each essaying not a
biography as such, not the record of the Teacher's sayings as such, but
intent upon launching each his own conception of Christ's mission.

¶Christ's sayings complete, brought into a sequence of times and
occasions, but lifted out of contexts alien to the present purpose, may
prove to be a glowing story new not only to the non-reader, but new even
to the whilom New-Testament readers who have not as yet discerned the
"continuities."

Devoted readers will not be diverted from the Great Text. Perhaps other
readers—the casual New-Testament reader and the *non-reader*—after
enjoying these pages may venture the greater enjoyment: the attentive
perusal of all the gospels and all the epistles, perhaps of all the New
Testament.
