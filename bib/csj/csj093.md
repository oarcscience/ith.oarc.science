### AFTER THE RESURRECTION (CONTINUED): JESUS IN PERSON: ON THE SHORE—THE GREAT CATCH OF FISH—PETER—THAT OTHER LOVED ONE

A.D. 30. Age 33. *Sea of Galilee*.

John 21, 1-25.

JESUS shewed himself again to the disciples at the sea of
Tiberias; <span id="fr_108"></span>[\*](#fn_104) and on this wise: there
were together Simon Peter and Thomas called Didymus, and Nathanael of
Cana in Galilee, and the *sons* of Zebedee, and two others of his
disciples.

Simon Peter saith unto them, I go a fishing. They say, We go with thee.
They entered into a ship immediately; and that night they caught
nothing.

But when the morning was come, Jesus stood on the shore: but the
disciples knew not that it was Jesus. Then saith he unto them,

<div class="jesussaid">

Children, have ye any meat?

</div>

They answered, No. And he said,

<div class="jesussaid">

Cast the net on the right side of the ship, and ye shall find.

</div>

They cast; and as soon as they were come to land, they saw a fire of
coals there, and fish laid thereon, and bread. Jesus saith,

<div class="jesussaid">

Bring of the fish which ye have now caught.

</div>

Peter drew the net to land full of great fishes, and for all there were
so many; yet was not the net broken.

Jesus saith unto them,

<div class="jesussaid">

Come *and* dine.

</div>

Jesus then taketh bread, and giveth them, and fish likewise.

¶So when they had dined, Jesus saith,

<div class="jesussaid">

Simon, *son* of Jonas, lovest thou me more than these?

</div>

He saith, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. Jesus saith,

<span id="page_142">p. 142</span>

<div class="jesussaid">

Feed my lambs.

</div>

He saith the second time,

<div class="jesussaid">

Simon, *son* of Jonas, lovest thou me?

</div>

He saith, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. Jesus saith,

<div class="jesussaid">

Feed my sheep.

</div>

He saith the third time,

<div class="jesussaid">

Simon, *son* of Jonas, lovest thou me?

</div>

Peter was grieved because he said the third time, Lovest thou me? And he
said, Lord, thou knowest all things; thou knowest that I love thee.
Jesus saith unto him,

<div class="jesussaid">

Feed my sheep.

Verily, verily, I say unto thee, When thou wast young, thou girdedst
thyself, and walkedst whither thou wouldest: but when thou shall be old,
thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another shall gird thee, and
carry *thee* whither thou wouldest not.

</div>

This spake he, signifying by what death he should glorify God. And he
saith unto Peter,

<div class="jesussaid">

Follow me.

</div>

Peter, turning about, seeth the disciple following, whom Jesus
loved. <span id="fr_109"></span>[\*](#fn_105) Seeing him, Peter saith,
Lord, and what *shall* this man *do?* Jesus answered,

<div class="jesussaid">

If I will that he tarry till I come, what *is that* to thee? follow thou
me.

</div>

This is the disciple <span id="fr_110"></span>[\*](#fn_105) which
testifieth of these things: and wrote these things. And there are also
many other things which Jesus did, the which, if they should be written
every one, I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the
books that should be written.
