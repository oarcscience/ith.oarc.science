### The EPISTLE of POLYCARP to the PHILIPPIANS.

\[The genuineness of this Epistle is controverted, but implicitly
believed by Archbishop Wake, whose translation is below. There is also a
translation by Dr. Cave, attached to his life of Polycarp.\]

#### CHAP. I.

<span class="small">*Commends the Philippians for their respect to those
who suffered for the Gospel; and for their own faith*.</span>

POLYCARP, and the presbyters that are with him, to the church of God
which  <span id="fr_1116"></span>[3](#fn_1116.md) is at Philippi: mercy
unto you and peace from God Almighty; and the Lord Jesus Christ, our
Saviour, be multiplied.

2 I rejoiced greatly with you in our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye received
the images of a true love, and accompanied, as it is behooved you, those
who were in bonds, becoming saints; which are the crowns of such as are
truly chosen by God and our Lord:

3 As also that the  <span id="fr_1117"></span>[4](#fn_1117.md) root of the
faith which was preached from ancient times, remains firm in you to this
day; and brings forth fruit to our Lord Jesus Christ, who suffered
himself to be brought even to the death for our sins.

4  <span id="fr_1118"></span>[5](#fn_1118.md) Whom God hath raised up,
having loosed the pains of  <span id="fr_1119"></span>[6](#fn_1119.md)
death, whom having not seen, ye love; in whom though now ye see him not,
yet believing ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory.

5 Into which many desire to enter;  <span
id="fr_1120"></span>[7](#fn_1120.md) knowing that by grace ye are saved;
not by works, but by the will of God through Jesus Christ.

6  <span id="fr_1121"></span>[8](#fn_1121.md) Wherefore girding up the
loins of your minds;  <span id="fr_1122"></span>[9](#fn_1122.md) serve the
Lord with fear, and in truth: laying aside all empty and vain speech,
and the error of many;  <span id="fr_1123"></span>[10](#fn_1123.md)
believing in him that raised up our Lord Jesus Christ from the dead, and
hath given him glory and a throne at his right hand.

7 To whom all things are made subject,  <span
id="fr_1124"></span>[11](#fn_1124.md) both that are in heaven, and that are
in earth; whom every  <span id="fr_1125"></span>[12](#fn_1125.md) living
creature shall worship; who shall come to be the judge of the quick and
dead.: whose blood God shall require of them that believe in him.

8 But he that raised up  <span id="fr_1126"></span>[13](#fn_1126.md) Christ
from the dead, shall also raise up us in like manner, if we do his will
and walk  <span id="fr_1127"></span>[14](#fn_1127.md) according to his
commandments; and love those things which he loved:

9 Abstaining from all  <span id="fr_1128"></span>[15](#fn_1128.md)
unrighteousness;

</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span>  <span
id="fr_1129"></span>[1](#fn_1129.md) inordinate affection, and love of
money; from evil speaking; false witness; not rendering evil for evil,
or railing for railing, or striking for striking, or cursing for
cursing.

10 But remembering what the Lord has  <span
id="fr_1130"></span>[2](#fn_1130.md) taught us saying, Judge not, and ye
shall not be judged; forgive and ye shall be forgiven; be ye merciful,
and ye shall obtain mercy; for with the same measure that ye mete
withal, it shall be measured to you again.

11 And again, that  <span id="fr_1131"></span>[3](#fn_1131.md) blessed are
the poor, and they that are persecuted for righteousness’ sake; for
theirs is the kingdom of God.

#### CHAP. II.

<span class="small">2 *Exhorts to Faith, Hope, and Charity.* 5 *Against
covetousness, and as to the duties of husbands, wives, widows,* 6
*deacons, young men, virgins, and presbyters*.</span>

THESE things, my brethren, I took not the liberty of myself to write
unto you concerning righteousness, but you yourselves before encouraged
me to it.

2 For neither can I, nor any other such as I am, come up to the wisdom
of the blessed and renowned Paul: who being himself in person with those
who then lived, did with all exactness and soundness teach the word
 <span id="fr_1132"></span>[4](#fn_1132.md) of truth; and being gone from
you wrote an  <span id="fr_1133"></span>[5](#fn_1133.md) epistle to you.

3 Into which if you look, you will be able to edify yourselves in the
faith that has been delivered unto you; which is the mother of us all;
being followed with hope, and led on by a general love, both towards God
and towards Christ, and towards our neighbour.

4 For if any man  <span id="fr_1134"></span>[6](#fn_1134.md) has these
things he has fulfilled the law of righteousness: for he that has
charity is far from all sin.

5 But the love of money is the  <span id="fr_1135"></span>[7](#fn_1135.md)
root of all evil. Knowing therefore that as we brought nothing into this
world, so neither may we carry any thing out; let us  <span
id="fr_1136"></span>[8](#fn_1136.md) arm ourselves with the armour of
righteousness.

6 And teach ourselves first to walk according to the commandments of the
Lord; and then your wives to walk likewise  <span
id="fr_1137"></span>[9](#fn_1137.md) according to the faith that is given
to them; in  <span id="fr_1138"></span>[10](#fn_1138.md) charity, and in
purity; loving their own husbands with all  <span
id="fr_1139"></span>[11](#fn_1139.md) sincerity, and all others alike with
all temperance; and to bring up their children in the instruction  <span
id="fr_1140"></span>[12](#fn_1140.md) and fear of the Lord.

7 The widows likewise teach that they be sober as to what concerns the
faith of the Lord: praying always for all men; being far from all
detraction, evil speaking, false witness; from covetousness, and from
all evil.

8 Knowing that they are the altars of God,  <span
id="fr_1141"></span>[13](#fn_1141.md) who sees all blemishes, and from whom
nothing is hid; who searches out the very reasonings, and thoughts, and
secrets of our hearts.

9 ¶ Knowing therefore that God is not mocked, we ought to walk worthy
both of his command and of his glory.

<span id="page_194">p. 194</span>

10 Also the deacons must be blameless before  <span
id="fr_1142"></span>[1](#fn_1142.md) him, as the ministers of God in
Christ, and not of men. Not false accusers; not double tongued; not
lovers of money; but  <span id="fr_1143"></span>[2](#fn_1143.md) moderate
in all things; compassionate, careful; walking according to the truth of
the Lord, who was the servant of all.

11 Whom if we please in this present world we shall also be made
partakers of that which is to come, according as he has promised to us,
that he will raise us from the dead; and that if we shall walk worthy of
him, we shall also reign together with him, if we believe.

12 In like manner the younger men must be unblameable in all things;
above all, taking care of their purity, and to restrain themselves from
all evil. For it is good to be cut off from the lusts that are in the
world; because every such  <span id="fr_1144"></span>[3](#fn_1144.md) lust
warreth against the spirit:  <span id="fr_1145"></span>[4](#fn_1145.md) and
neither fornicators, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with
mankind, shall inherit the kingdom of God; nor they who do such things
as are foolish and unreasonable.

13 Wherefore ye must needs abstain from all these things, being subject
to the  <span id="fr_1146"></span>[5](#fn_1146.md) priests and deacons, as
unto God and Christ.

14 The virgins admonish to walk in a spotless and pure conscience.

15 And let the  <span id="fr_1147"></span>[6](#fn_1147.md) elders be
compassionate and merciful towards all;  <span
id="fr_1148"></span>[7](#fn_1148.md) turning them from their errors;
seeking out those that are weak; not forgetting the widows, the
fatherless, and the poor; but always  <span
id="fr_1149"></span>[8](#fn_1149.md) providing what is good both in the
sight of God and man.

16 Abstaining from all wrath, respect of persons, and unrighteous
judgment: and especially being free from all covetousness.

17 Not  <span id="fr_1150"></span>[9](#fn_1150.md) easy to believe any
thing against any; not severe in judgment; knowing that we are all
debtors in point of sin.

18 If therefore we pray to the Lord that he would forgive us, we ought
also to forgive others; for we are all in the sight of our Lord and God;
 <span id="fr_1151"></span>[10](#fn_1151.md) and must all stand before the
judgment seat of Christ; and shall every one give an account  <span
id="fr_1152"></span>[11](#fn_1152.md) of himself.

19 Let us therefore serve him in fear, and with all reverence as both
himself hath commanded; and as the Apostles who have preached the Gospel
unto us, and the prophets who have foretold the coming of our Lord have
taught us.

20 Being zealous of what is good; abstaining from all offence, and from
false brethren; and from those who bear the name of Christ in hypocrisy;
who deceive vain men.

#### CHAP. III.

<span class="small">1 *As to faith in our Saviour Christ: his nature and
sufferings, the resurrection and judgment.* 3 *Exhorts to prayer* 5 *and
steadfastness in the faith, from the examples of Christ,* 7 *and
Apostles and saints, and exhorts to carefulness in all
well-doing*.</span>

FOR  <span id="fr_1153"></span>[12](#fn_1153.md) whosoever does not confess
that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh, he is Antichrist: and whoever
does not confess  <span id="fr_1154"></span>[13](#fn_1154.md) his suffering
upon the cross, is from the devil.

2 And whosoever perverts the oracles of the Lord to his own lusts;

<span id="page_195">p. 195</span>

and says that there shall neither be any resurrection, nor judgment, he
is the first-born of Satan.

3 Wherefore leaving the vanity of many, and their false doctrines; let
us return to the word that was delivered to us from the beginning;
 <span id="fr_1155"></span>[1](#fn_1155.md) Watching unto prayer; and
persevering in fasting.

4 With supplication beseeching the all seeing God  <span
id="fr_1156"></span>[2](#fn_1156.md) not to lead us into temptation; as the
Lord hath said,  <span id="fr_1157"></span>[3](#fn_1157.md) The spirit is
truly willing, but the flesh is weak.

5 Let us therefore without ceasing hold steadfastly to him who is our
hope, and the earnest of our righteousness, even Jesus Christ;  <span
id="fr_1158"></span>[4](#fn_1158.md) Who his own self bare our sins in his
own body on the tree: who did no sin, neither was guile found in his
mouth. But suffered all for us that we might live  <span
id="fr_1159"></span>[5](#fn_1159.md) through him.

6 Let us therefore imitate his patience; and if we suffer for his name,
let us glorify him; for this example he has given us by himself, and so
have we believed.

7 Wherefore I exhort all of you that ye obey the word of righteousness,
and exercise all patience; which ye have seen set forth before our eyes,
not only in the blessed Ignatius, and Zozimus, and Rufus; but in others
among yourselves; and in Paul himself, and the rest of the Apostles:

8 Being  <span id="fr_1160"></span>[6](#fn_1160.md) confident of this, that
all, these have not run in vain; but in faith and righteousness, and are
gone to the place that was due to them from the Lord; with whom they
also suffered.

9 For they loved not this present world; but him who died, and was
raised again by God for us.

10 Stand therefore in these things, and follow the example of the Lord;
being firm and immutable in the faith, lovers of the brotherhood, lovers
of one another:  <span id="fr_1161"></span>[7](#fn_1161.md) companions
together in the truth,  <span id="fr_1162"></span>[8](#fn_1162.md) being
kind and gentle towards each other, despising none.

11 When it is in your power to do good, defer it not, for charity
delivered from death.

12 Be all of you subject one to another,  <span
id="fr_1163"></span>[9](#fn_1163.md) having your conversation  <span
id="fr_1164"></span>[10](#fn_1164.md) honest among the Gentiles; that by
your good works, both ye yourselves may receive praise, and the Lord may
not  <span id="fr_1165"></span>[11](#fn_1165.md) be blasphemed through you.
But wo be to him by whom the name of the Lord is blasphemed.

13 Therefore teach all men sobriety; in which do ye also exercise
yourselves.

#### CHAP. IV.

<span class="small">*Valens, a presbyter, having fallen into the sin of
covetousness, he exhorts them against it*.</span>

I AM greatly afflicted for Valens, who was once a presbyter among you;
that he should so little understand the place that was given to him in
the church. Wherefore I admonish you that ye abstain from  <span
id="fr_1166"></span>[12](#fn_1166.md) covetousness; and that ye be chaste,
and true of speech.

2  <span id="fr_1167"></span>[13](#fn_1167.md) Keep yourselves from all
evil. For he that in these things cannot govern himself how shall he be
able to prescribe them to another?

3 If a man does not keep himself from  <span
id="fr_1168"></span>[14](#fn_1168.md) covetousness, he shall be polluted
with idolatry and be judged as if he were a Gentile.

<span id="page_196">p. 196</span>

4 But who of you are ignorant of the judgment of God?  <span
id="fr_1169"></span>[1](#fn_1169.md) Do we not know that the saints shall
judge the world, as Paul teaches?

5 But I have neither perceived nor heard any thing of this kind in you,
among whom the blessed  <span id="fr_1170"></span>[2](#fn_1170.md) Paul
laboured; and who are named in the beginning of his Epistle.

6 For he glories of you in all the churches who then only knew God; for
we did not then know him. Wherefore, my brethren,

I am exceedingly sorry both for him, and for his wife; to whom God grant
a true repentance.

7 And be ye also moderate upon this occasion; and look not upon such as
enemies, but call them back as suffering, and erring members, that ye
may save your whole body: for by so doing, ye shall edify your own
selves.

8 For I trust that ye are well exercised in the Holy Scriptures, and
that nothing is hid from you; but at present it is not granted unto me
to practice that which is  <span id="fr_1171"></span>[3](#fn_1171.md)
written, Be angry and sin not; and again, Let not the sun go down upon
your wrath.

9 Blessed be he that believeth and remembereth these things; which also
I trust you do.

10 Now the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ; and he himself who
is our everlasting high-priest, the Son of God, even Jesus Christ, build
you up in faith and in truth and in all meekness and lenity; in patience
and long-suffering, in forbearance and chastity.

11 And grant unto you a lot and portion among his saints; and us with
you, and to all that are under the heavens, who shall believe in our
Lord Jesus Christ, and in his Father  <span
id="fr_1172"></span>[4](#fn_1172.md) who raised him from the dead.

12 Pray for all the saints: pray also for kings, and  <span
id="fr_1173"></span>[5](#fn_1173.md) all that are in authority; and for
those who persecute you, and hate you, and for the enemies of the cross;
that your fruit may be manifest in all; and that ye may be perfect in
 <span id="fr_1174"></span>[6](#fn_1174.md) Christ.

13  <span id="fr_1175"></span>[7](#fn_1175.md) Ye wrote to me, both ye, and
also Ignatius, that if any one went from hence into Syria, he should
bring your letters with him; which also I will take care of, as soon as
I shall have a convenient opportunity; either by myself, or him whom I
shall send upon your account.

14 The Epistles of Ignatius which he wrote  <span
id="fr_1176"></span>[8](#fn_1176.md) unto us, together with what others of
his have come to our hands, we have sent to you, according to your
order; which are subjoined to this epistle.

15 By which we may be greatly profited; for they treat of faith and
patience, and of all things that pertain to edification in  <span
id="fr_1177"></span>[9](#fn_1177.md) the Lord Jesus.

161 What you know certainly of Ignatius, and those that are with him
signify to us.

17 If These things have I written unto you by Crescens, whom by this
present epistle I have recommended to you, and do now again commend.

18 For he has had his conversation without blame among us; and I suppose
also with you.

19 Ye will also have regard unto his sister when she shall come unto
you.

20 Be ye safe in the Lord Jesus Christ;  <span
id="fr_1178"></span>[10](#fn_1178.md) and in favour with all yours. Amen.
