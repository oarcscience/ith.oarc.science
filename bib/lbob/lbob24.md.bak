### The EPISTLE of IGNATIUS to POLYCARP.

#### CHAP. I.

<span class="small">*Blesses God for the firm establishment of Polycarp
in the faith, and gives him particular directions for improving
it*.</span>

IGNATIUS, who is also called Theophorus, to Polycarp, bishop of the
church  <span id="fr_1090"></span>[4](#fn_1090.md) which is at Smyrna;
their overseer, but rather himself overlooked by God the Father, and the
Lord Jesus Christ: all happiness.

2 Having known that thy mind towards God, is fixed as it were upon an
immovable rock; I exceedingly give thanks, that I have been thought
worthy to behold thy  <span id="fr_1091"></span>[5](#fn_1091.md) blessed
face, in which may I always rejoice in God.

3 Wherefore I beseech thee by the grace of God with which thou art
clothed, to press forward in thy course, and to exhort all others that
they may be saved.

4 Maintain thy place with all care  <span
id="fr_1092"></span>[6](#fn_1092.md) both of flesh and spirit: Make it thy
endeavour to preserve unity, than which nothing is better. Bear with all
men, even as the Lord with thee.

5 Support all in love, as also thou dost.  <span
id="fr_1093"></span>[7](#fn_1093.md) Pray without ceasing: ask more
understanding than what thou already hast. Be watchful, having thy
spirit always awake.

6 Speak to every one  <span id="fr_1094"></span>[8](#fn_1094.md) according
as God shall enable thee. Bear the  <span
id="fr_1095"></span>[9](#fn_1095.md) infirmities of all, as a perfect
combatant; where the labour is great, the gain  <span
id="fr_1096"></span>[10](#fn_1096.md) is the more.

7 If thou shalt love the good disciples, what thank is it? But rather do
thou subject to thee those that are mischievous, in meekness.

<span id="page_190">p. 190</span>

8 Every wound is not healed with the same plaster: if the accessions of
the disease be vehement, modify them with  <span
id="fr_1097"></span>[1](#fn_1097.md) soft remedies: be in all things  <span
id="fr_1098"></span>[2](#fn_1098.md) wise as a serpent, but harmless as a
dove.

9 For this cause thou art composed of flesh and spirit; that thou mayest
modify those things that appear before thy face.

10 And as for those that are not seen, pray to God that he would reveal
them unto thee, that so thou mayest be wanting in nothing, but mayest
abound in every gift.

11 The times demand thee, as the pilots the winds; and he that is tossed
in a tempest, the haven where he would be; that thou mayst attain unto
God.

12 Be sober as the combatant of God: the  <span
id="fr_1099"></span>[3](#fn_1099.md) crown proposed to thee is immortality,
and eternal life; concerning which thou art also fully persuaded. I will
be thy surety in all things, and my bonds, which thou hast loved.

13 Let not those that seem worthy of credit, but teach other doctrines,
 <span id="fr_1100"></span>[4](#fn_1100.md) disturb thee. Stand firm and
immovable, as au anvil when it is beaten upon.

14 It is the part of a brave combatant to be  <span
id="fr_1101"></span>[5](#fn_1101.md) wounded, and yet overcome. But
especially we ought to endure all things for God's sake, that he may
bear with us.

15 Be every day  <span id="fr_1102"></span>[6](#fn_1102.md) better than
other: consider the times; and expect him, who is above all time,
eternal, invisible, though for our sakes made visible: impalpable, and
impassable, yet for us subjected to sufferings; enduring all manner of
ways for our salvation.

#### CHAP. II.

<span class="small">1 *Continues his advice,* 6 *and teaches him how to
advise others.* 12 *Enforces unity and subjection to the bishop*.</span>

LET not the widows be neglected: be thou after God, their guardian.

2 Let nothing be done without thy knowledge and consent; neither do thou
anything but according to the will of God; as also thou dost,  <span
id="fr_1103"></span>[7](#fn_1103.md) with all constancy.

3 Let your assemblies be more full: inquire into all by name.

4 Overlook not the men and maid servants; neither let them be puffed up:
but rather let them be the more subject to the glory of God, that they
may obtain from him a better liberty.

5 Let them not desire to  <span id="fr_1104"></span>[8](#fn_1104.md) be set
free at the public cost, that they be not slaves to their own lusts.

6 Flee evil  <span id="fr_1105"></span>[9](#fn_1105.md) arts; or rather,
make not any mention of them.

7 Say to my sisters, that they love the Lord; and be satisfied with
their own husbands, both in the flesh and spirit.

8 In like manner, exhort my brethren, in the name of Jesus Christ, that
they love their wives, even as the Lord the Church.

9 If any man can remain in a virgin state,  <span
id="fr_1106"></span>[10](#fn_1106.md) to the honour of the flesh of Christ,
let him remain without boasting; but if he boast, he is undone. And if
he desire to be more taken notice

<span id="page_191">p. 191</span>

of than the bishop he is corrupted.

10 But it becomes all such as are married, whether men or women to come
together with the consent of the bishop, that so their marriage may be
according to godliness, and not in lust.

11 Let all things be done to the honour of God.

12  <span id="fr_1107"></span>[1](#fn_1107.md) Hearken unto the bishop,
that God also may hearken unto you. My soul be security for them that
submit to their bishop, with their presbyters and deacons. And may my
portion be together with theirs in God.

13 Labour with one another; contend together, run together, suffer
together; sleep together, and rise together; as the stewards, and
assessors, and ministers of God.

14 Please him under whom ye war, and from whom ye receive your wages.
Let none of you be found a deserter; but let your baptism remain, as
your arms; your faith, as your helmet; your charity, as your spear; your
patience, as your whole armour.

15 Let your works be your  <span id="fr_1108"></span>[2](#fn_1108.md)
charge, that so you may receive a suitable reward. Be longsuffering
therefore towards each other in meekness: as God is towards you.

16 Let me have joy of you in all things.

#### CHAP. III.

<span class="small">1 *Greets Polycarp on the peace of the church at
Antioch: and desires him to write to that and other churches*.</span>

NOW forasmuch as the church of Antioch in Syria,  <span
id="fr_1109"></span>[3](#fn_1109.md) is, as I am told, \[one word
illegible.—JBH\] through your prayers; I also have been the more
comforted  <span id="fr_1110"></span>[4](#fn_1110.md) and without care in
God; if so be that by suffering, I shall attain unto God; that through
your prayers I may be found a disciple of Christ.

2 It will be very fit, O most worthy Polycarp, to call a  <span
id="fr_1111"></span>[5](#fn_1111.md) select council, and choose some one
whom ye particularly love, and who is patient of labour; that he may be
the messenger of God; and that going unto Syria, he may glorify your
incessant love, to the praise of Christ.

3 A Christian has not the power of himself: but must be always at
leisure for God's service. Now this work is both God's and your's: when
ye shall have perfected it.

4 For I trust through the grace of God that ye are ready to every good
work that is fitting for you in the Lord.

5 Knowing therefore your earnest affection for the truth, I have
exhorted you by  <span id="fr_1112"></span>[6](#fn_1112.md) these short
letters.

6 But forasmuch as I have not been able to write to all the churches,
because I must suddenly sail from Troas to Neapolis; (for so is the
command of those to whose pleasure I am subject;) do you write to the
churches that are near you, as being instructed in the will of God, that
they also may do in like manner.

7 Let those that are able send  <span id="fr_1113"></span>[7](#fn_1113.md)
messengers; and let the rest send their letters by those who shall be
sent by you: that you

<span id="page_192">p. 192</span>

may be glorified  <span id="fr_1114"></span>[1](lbob25.htm#fn_1114.md) to
all eternity, of which you are worthy.

8 I salute all by name, particularly the wife of Epitropus, with all her
house and children. I salute Attalus my well-beloved.

9 I salute him who shall be thought worthy to be sent by you into Syria.
Let grace be ever with him,  <span
id="fr_1115"></span>[2](lbob25.htm#fn_1115.md) and with Polycarp who sends
him.

10 I wish you all happiness in our God, Jesus Christ; in whom continue,
in the unity and protection of God.

11 I salute Alce my well-beloved. Farewell in the Lord.

¶ *To Polycarp*.
