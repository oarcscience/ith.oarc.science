### The EPISTLE of IGNATIUS to the ROMANS.

#### CHAP. I.

<span class="small">*He testifies his desire to see, and his hopes of
suffering for Christ,* 5 *which he earnestly entreats them not to
prevent,* 10 *but to pray for him, that God would strengthen him to the
combat*.</span>

IGNATIUS,  <span id="fr_947"></span>[8](#fn_947) who is also called
Theophorus, to the church which has obtained mercy  <span
id="fr_948"></span>[9](#fn_948) from the majesty of the Most High
Father, and his only  <span id="fr_949"></span>[10](#fn_949) begotten
Son Jesus Christ; beloved, and

<span id="page_179">p. 179</span>

illuminated  <span id="fr_950"></span>[1](#fn_950) through the will of
who willeth all things which are according to the love of Jesus Christ
our  <span id="fr_951"></span>[2](#fn_951) God which also presides in
the  <span id="fr_952"></span>[3](#fn_952) place of the region of the
Romans; and which  <span id="fr_953"></span>[4](#fn_953) I salute in the
name of Jesus Christ ( <span id="fr_954"></span>[5](#fn_954) as being)
united both in flesh and spirit to all his commands, and  <span
id="fr_955"></span>[6](#fn_955) filled with the grace of God;  <span
id="fr_956"></span>[7](#fn_956) (all joy) in Jesus Christ our God.

2  <span id="fr_957"></span>[8](#fn_957) Forasmuch as I have at last
 <span id="fr_958"></span>[9](#fn_958) obtained through my prayers to
God, to see your  <span id="fr_959"></span>[10](#fn_959) faces,  <span
id="fr_960"></span>[11](#fn_960) which I much desired to do; being bound
in Jesus Christ, I hope ere long to salute you, if it shall be the will
 <span id="fr_961"></span>[12](#fn_961) of God to grant me to attain
unto the end I long for.

3 For the beginning is well disposed, if I shall but have grace, without
hindrance, to receive  <span id="fr_962"></span>[13](#fn_962) what is
appointed for me.

4 But I fear your love, lest it do me an injury. For it is easy for you
to do what you please; but it  <span id="fr_963"></span>[14](#fn_963)
will be hard for me to attain unto God, if you spare me.

5 But I  <span id="fr_964"></span>[15](#fn_964) would not that ye should
please men, but God  <span id="fr_965"></span>[16](#fn_965) whom also ye
do please. For neither shall I hereafter have such an opportunity  <span
id="fr_966"></span>[17](#fn_966) of going unto God; nor will you if ye
shall now be silent, ever be [entitled](errata.htm#8) to a better work.
For if you shall be silent  <span id="fr_967"></span>[18](#fn_967) in my
behalf, I shall be made partaker of God.

6 But if you shall love my  <span id="fr_968"></span>[19](#fn_968) body,
I shall have my course again to run. Wherefore ye cannot do me a greater
kindness, than to suffer me to be sacrificed unto God, now that the
altar is already prepared:

7 That  <span id="fr_969"></span>[20](#fn_969) when ye shall be gathered
together in love, ye may  <span id="fr_970"></span>[21](#fn_970) give
thanks to the Father through Christ Jesus; that he has vouchsafed  <span
id="fr_971"></span>[22](#fn_971) to bring a bishop of Syria unto you,
being called from the east unto the west.

8 For it is good for me to set from the world, unto God; that I may rise
again unto him.

9 Ye have never envied any one; ye have taught other. I would therefore
that ye  <span id="fr_972"></span>[23](#fn_972) should now do those
things yourselves, which in your instructions you have  <span
id="fr_973"></span>[24](#fn_973) prescribed to others.

10 Only pray for me, that God would give me both inward and outward
strength, that I may not only say, but will; nor be only called a
Christian, but be found one.

11 For if I shall be found a Christian, I may then deservedly be called
one; and be thought faithful, when I shall no longer appear to the
world.

12 Nothing is  <span id="fr_974"></span>[25](#fn_974) good, that is
seen.

<span id="page_180">p. 180</span>

13 For even our God, Jesus Christ, now that he is in the Father, does so
much the more appear.

14 A Christian is not a work of  <span id="fr_975"></span>[1](#fn_975)
opinion; but of greatness of mind, ( <span
id="fr_976"></span>[2](#fn_976) especially when he is hated by the
world.)

#### CHAP. II.

<span class="small">*Expresses his great desire and determination to
suffer martyrdom*.</span>

I WRITE to the churches, and  <span id="fr_977"></span>[3](#fn_977)
signify to them all, that am willing to die for God, unless  <span
id="fr_978"></span>[4](#fn_978) hinder me.

2 I beseech you that you  <span id="fr_979"></span>[5](#fn_979) shew not
an unseasonable good will towards me. Suffer me to be food to the wild
beasts; by whom I shall attain unto God.

3 For I am the wheat of God; and I shall be ground by the teeth of the
wild beasts, that I may be found the pure bread  <span
id="fr_980"></span>[6](#fn_980) of Christ.

4 Rather  <span id="fr_981"></span>[7](#fn_981) encourage the beasts,
that they may become my sepulchre; and may leave nothing of my body;
that being dead I mazy not be troublesome to any.

5 Then shall I be truly the disciple of Jesus Christ, when the world
shall not see so much as my body, Pray therefore unto Christ for me,
that by these instruments I may be made the sacrifice  <span
id="fr_982"></span>[8](#fn_982) of God.

6 I do not, as Peter and Paul, command you. They were Apostles, I a
condemned man; they were free, but I am even to this day a servant:

7 But if I shall suffer, I shall then become the freeman of Jesus
Christ, and shall rise  <span id="fr_983"></span>[9](#fn_983) free. And
now, being in bonds, I learn, not to desire  <span
id="fr_984"></span>[10](#fn_984) anything.

8 From Syria even unto Rome, I fight with beasts both by sea and land;
both night and day: being bound to ten leopards, that is to say, to such
a band of soldiers; who, though treated with all manner of kindness, are
the worse for it.

9 But I am the more instructed by their injuries;  <span
id="fr_985"></span>[11](#fn_985) yet am I not therefore justified.

10 May I enjoy the wild beasts that are prepared for me; which also I
wish may  <span id="fr_986"></span>[12](#fn_986) exercise all their
fierceness upon me.

11 And whom for that end I will  <span id="fr_987"></span>[13](#fn_987)
encourage, that they may be sure to devour me, and not serve me as they
have done some, whom out of fear they have not touched. But, and if they
will not do it willingly, I will provoke them to it.

12 Pardon me in this matter; I know what is profitable for me. Now I
begin to  <span id="fr_988"></span>[14](#fn_988) be a disciple. Nor
 <span id="fr_989"></span>[15](#fn_989) shall anything move me, whether
visible or invisible, that I may attain to Jesus Christ.

13 Let fire, and the cross; let the  <span
id="fr_990"></span>[16](#fn_990) companies of wild beasts;  <span
id="fr_991"></span>[17](#fn_991) let breakings of bones and tearing of
members; let the  <span id="fr_992"></span>[18](#fn_992) shattering in
pieces of the whole body, and all the wicked  <span
id="fr_993"></span>[19](#fn_993) torments of the devil come upon me;
only let  <span id="fr_994"></span>[20](#fn_994) me enjoy Jesus Christ.

<span id="page_181">p. 181</span>

14 All the  <span id="fr_995"></span>[1](#fn_995) ends of the world, and
the kingdoms  <span id="fr_996"></span>[2](#fn_996) of it, will profit
me nothing: I would rather die  <span id="fr_997"></span>[3](#fn_997)
for Jesus Christ, than rule to the utmost ends of the earth.  <span
id="fr_998"></span>[4](#fn_998) Him I seek who died for us; him I
desire, that rose again for us. This is the  <span
id="fr_999"></span>[5](#fn_999) gain that is laid up for me.

15 Pardon me, my brethren, ye shall not hinder me from living.  <span
id="fr_1000"></span>[6](#fn_1000) Nor seeing I desire to go to God, may
you separate me from him, for the sake of this world; nor reduce me by
any of the  <span id="fr_1001"></span>[7](#fn_1001) desires of it.
Suffer me to  <span id="fr_1002"></span>[8](#fn_1002) enter into pure
light: Where being come, I shall be indeed the  <span
id="fr_1003"></span>[9](#fn_1003) servant of  <span
id="fr_1004"></span>[10](#fn_1004) God.

16 Permit me to imitate the passion of my God. If any one has him within
himself, let him consider what I desire; and let him have compassion on
me, as knowing  <span id="fr_1005"></span>[11](#fn_1005) how I am
straightened.

#### CHAP. III.

<span class="small">Further expresses his desire to suffer.</span>

THE prince of this world would fain carry me away, and corrupt  <span
id="fr_1006"></span>[12](#fn_1006) my resolution towards my God. Let
none of you  <span id="fr_1007"></span>[13](#fn_1007) therefore help
 <span id="fr_1008"></span>[14](#fn_1008) him: Rather do ye join with
me, that is, with God.

2 Do not speak with Jesus Christ, and yet covet the world. Let not any
envy dwell with you; No not though I myself when I shall be come unto
you, should exhort you to it, yet do not ye hearken to me; but rather
believe what I now write to you.

3 For though I am alive, at the writing this, yet my desire is to die.
My love is crucified;  <span id="fr_1009"></span>[15](#fn_1009) (and the
 <span id="fr_1010"></span>[16](#fn_1010) fire that is within me does
not desire any water; but being alive and  <span
id="fr_1011"></span>[17](#fn_1011) springing within me, says,) Come to
the Father.

4 I take no pleasure in the food of corruption, nor in the pleasures of
this life.

5 I desire the bread of God  <span id="fr_1012"></span>[18](#fn_1012)
which is the flesh of Jesus Christ, ( <span
id="fr_1013"></span>[19](#fn_1013) of the seed of David; and the drink
that I long for) is his blood, which is incorruptible love. <span
id="fr_1014"></span>[20](#fn_1014)

6 I have no desire to live any longer after the manner of men,  <span
id="fr_1015"></span>[21](#fn_1015) neither shall I, if you consent. Be
ye therefore willing, that ye yourselves also may be  <span
id="fr_1016"></span>[22](#fn_1016) pleasing to God. I  <span
id="fr_1017"></span>[23](#fn_1017) exhort you  <span
id="fr_1018"></span>[24](#fn_1018) in a few words; I pray you believe
me.

7 Jesus Christ will shew you that I speak truly. My mouth is without
deceit, and the Father hath truly spoken  <span
id="fr_1019"></span>[25](#fn_1019) by it. Pray therefore for me, that I
may accomplish what I desire.

8 I have not written to you after the flesh, but according to the will
of God. If I shall suffer,  <span id="fr_1020"></span>[26](#fn_1020) ye
have loved me; but if I

<span id="page_182">p. 182</span>

shall be rejected,  <span id="fr_1021"></span>[1](#fn_1021) ye have
hated me.

9 Remember in your prayers the church of Syria, which now enjoys God for
its shepherd instead of me:  <span id="fr_1022"></span>[2](#fn_1022) Let
Jesus Christ only  <span id="fr_1023"></span>[3](#fn_1023) oversee it,
and your charity.

10 But I am even ashamed to be reckoned as one of them: For neither am I
worthy, being the least among them, and as one  <span
id="fr_1024"></span>[4](#fn_1024) born out of due season. But through
mercy I have obtained to be somebody, if I shall get unto God.

11 My spirit salutes you; and the charity of the churches that have
received me in the name of Jesus Christ; not as a passenger. For even
they that were not near to me in the way, have gone before me to the
next city to meet me.

12 These things I write to you from Smyrna, by the most worthy of the
church of Ephesus.

13 There is now with me, together with many others, Crocus, most beloved
of me. As for those which are  <span id="fr_1025"></span>[5](#fn_1025)
come from Syria, and are gone before me to Rome, to the glory of God, I
suppose you are not ignorant of them.

14 Ye shall therefore signify to them, that I draw near, for they are
all worthy both of God and of you: Whom it is fit that you refresh in
all things.

15 This have I written to you, the day before the ninth of the calends
of September.  <span id="fr_1026"></span>[6](#fn_1026) Be strong unto
the end, in the patience of Jesus Christ.  <span
id="fr_1027"></span>[7](#fn_1027)
