### LETTERS OF HEROD AND PILATE.

#### <span class="smallcaps">Connecting Roman History with the Death of Christ at Jerusalem.</span>

\[These letters occur in a Syriac MS., of the sixth or seventh century,
in the British Museum. Dr. Tischendorf states in his Apocalypses
Apocryphæ (Prolegg. p. 56) that he has a copy of the same in Greek from
a Paris MS., of which he says "scripture satis differt, non item
argumentum." The letters are followed by a few extracts which seem to
have been added by some copyist, although they are followed by the
subscription to Pilate's letter. We suppose that by Justinus, we are to
understand Justus of Tiberias of whom Josephus speaks as a historian of
his tine. We cannot venture an opinion favorable to the genuineness of
this extract, because Photius says Justus did not mention Christ. By
Theodorus, we understand the Emperor Tiberius. The question and answer
agree in sense with what is read in the "Anaphora," or response of
Pilate.\]

#### LETTER OF HEROD TO PILATE THE GOVERNOR.

<span class="smallcaps">Herod to Pontius Pilate the Governor of
Jerusalem: Peace.</span>

I AM in great anxiety. I write these things unto thee, that when thou
hast heard them thou mayest be grieved for me. For as my daughter
Herodias, who is dear to me, was playing upon a pool of water which had
ice upon it, it broke under her, and all her body went down, and her
head was cut off and remained on the surface of the ice. And behold, her
mother is holding her head upon her knees in her lap, and my whole house
is in great sorrow. For I, when I heard of the man Jesus, wished to come
to thee, that I might see him alone, and hear his word, whether it was
like that of the sons of men. And it is certain that because of the many
evil things which were done by me to John the Baptist, and because I
mocked the Christ, behold I receive the reward of righteousness, <span
id="fr_1426"></span>[1](#fn_1418.md) for I have shed much blood of others’
children upon the earth. <span id="fr_1427"></span>[2](#fn_1419.md)
Therefore the judgments of God are righteous; for every man receives
according

<span id="page_270">p. 270</span>

to his thought. But since thou wast worthy to see that God-man,
therefore it becometh you to pray for me.

My son Azbonius also is in the agony of the hour of death.

And I too am in affliction and great trial, because I have the dropsy;
and am in great distress, because I persecuted the introducer of baptism
by water, which was John. Therefore, my brother, the judgments of God
are righteous.

And my wife, again, through all her grief for her daughter, is become
blind in her left eye, because we desired to blind the Eye of
righteousness. There is no peace to the doers of evil, saith the
Lord. <span id="fr_1428"></span>[1](#fn_1420.md) For already great
affliction cometh upon the priests and upon the writers of the law;
because they delivered unto thee the Just One. For this is the
consummation of the world, that they consented that the Gentiles should
become heirs. For the children of light shall be cast out, <span
id="fr_1429"></span>[2](#fn_1421.md) for they have not observed the things
which were preached concerning the Lord, and concerning his Son.
Therefore gird up thy loins, <span id="fr_1430"></span>[3](#fn_1422.md) and
receive righteousness, thou with thy wife remembering Jesus night and
day; and the kingdom shall belong to you Gentiles, for we the (chosen)
people have mocked the Righteous One.

Now if there is place for our request, O Pilate, because we were at one
time in power, bury my household carefully; for it is right that we
should be buried by thee, rather than by the priests, whom, after a
little time, as the Scriptures say, at the coming of Jesus Christ,
vengeance shall overtake.

Fare thee well, with Procla thy wife.

I send thee the earrings of my daughter and my own ring, that they may
be unto thee a memorial of my decease. For already do worms begin to
issue from my body, <span id="fr_1431"></span>[4](#fn_1423.md) and lo, I am
receiving temporal judgment, and I am afraid of the judgment to come.
For in both we stand before the works of the living God; but this
judgment, which is temporal, is for a time, while that to come is
judgment for ever.

End of the Letter to Pilate the Governor.

#### LETTER OF PILATE TO HEROD.

<span class="smallcaps">Pilate to Herod the Tetrarch: Peace.</span>

KNOW and see, that in the day when thou didst deliver Jesus unto me, I
took pity on myself, and testified by washing my hands (that I was
innocent), concerning him who rose from the grave after three days, and
had performed thy pleasure in him, for thou didst desire me to be
associated with thee in his crucifixion. But I now learn from the
executioners and from the soldiers who watched his sepulchre that he
rose from the dead. And I have especially confirmed what was told me,
that he appeared bodily in Galilee,

<span id="page_271">p. 271</span>

to the same form, and with the same voice, and with the same doctrine,
and with the sane disciples, not having changed <span
id="fr_1432"></span>[1](#fn_1424.md) in anything, but preaching with
boldness his resurrection, and an everlasting kingdom.

And behold, heaven and earth rejoice; and behold, Procla my wife is
believing in the visions which appeared unto her, when thou sentest that
I should deliver Jesus to the people of Israel, because of the ill-will
they had.

Now when Procla, my wife, <span id="fr_1433"></span>[2](#fn_1425.md) heard
that Jesus was risen, and had appeared in Galilee, she took with her
Longinus the centurion and twelve soldiers, the same that had watched at
the sepulchre, and went to greet the face of Christ, as if to a great
spectacle, and saw him with his disciples.

Now while they were standing, and wondering, and gazing at him, he
looked at them, and said to them, What is it? Do ye believe in me?
Procla, know that in the covenant which God gave to the fathers, it is
said that every body which had perished should live by means of my
death, which ye have seen. And now, ye see that I live, whom ye
crucified. And I suffered many things, till that I was laid in the
sepulchre. But now, hear me, and believe in my Father—God who is in me.
For I loosed the cords of death, and brake the gates of Sheol; and my
coming shall be hereafter.

And when Procla my wife and the Romans heard these things, they came and
told me, weeping; for they also were against him, when they devised the
evils which they had done unto him. So that, I also was on the couch of
my bed in affliction, and put on a garment of mourning, and took unto me
fifty Romans with my wife and went into Galilee.

And when I was going in the way I testified these things; that Herod did
these things by me, that he took counsel with me, and constrained me to
arm my hands against him, and to judge him that judgeth all, and to
scourge the Just One, Lord of the just. And when we drew nigh to him, O
Herod, a great voice was heard from heaven, and dreadful thunder, and
the earth trembled, and gave forth a sweet smell, like unto which was
never perceived even in the temple of Jerusalem. Now while I stood in
the way, our Lord saw me as he stood and talked with his disciples. But
I prayed in my heart, for I knew that it was he whom ye delivered unto
me, that he was Lord of created things and Creator of all. But we, when
we saw him, all of us fell upon our faces before his feet. And I said
with a loud voice, I have sinned, O Lord, in that I sat and judged thee,
who avengest all in truth. And lo, I know that thou art God, the Son of
God, and I beheld thy humanity and not thy divinity. But Herod, with the
children of Israel, constrained me to do evil unto thee. Have pity,
therefore, upon me, O God of Israel!

<span id="page_272">p. 272</span>

And my wife, in great anguish, said, God of heaven and of earth, God of
Israel, reward me not according to the deeds of Pontius Pilate, nor
according to the will of the children of Israel, nor according to the
thought of the sons of the priests; but remember my husband in thy
glory!

Now our Lord drew near and raised up me and my wife, and the Romans; and
I looked at him and saw there were on him the scars of his cross. And he
said, That which all the righteous fathers hoped to receive, and saw
not—in thy time the Lord of Time, the Son of Man, the Son of the Most
High, who is for ever, arose from the dead, and is glorified on high by
all that he created, and established for ever and ever.

1\. Justinus, one of the writers that were in the days of Augustus and
Tiberius and Gains, wrote in his third discourse: Now Mary the Galilæan,
who bare the Christ that was crucified in Jerusalem, had not been with a
husband. And Joseph did not abandon her; but Joseph continued in
sanctity without a wife, he and his five sons by a former wife; and Mary
continued without a husband.

2\. Theodorus wrote to Pilate the Governor: Who was the man, against
whom there was a complaint before thee, that he was crucified by the men
of Palestine? If the many demanded this righteously, why didst thou not
consent to their righteousness? And if they demanded this unrighteously,
how didst thou transgress the law and command what was far from
righteousness?

Pilate sent to him:—Because he wrought signs I did not wish to crucify
him: and since his accusers said, He calleth himself a king, I crucified
him.

3\. Josephus saith: Agrippa, the king, was clothed in a robe woven with
silver, and saw the spectacle in the theatre of Cæsarea. When the people
saw that his raiment flashed, they said to him, Hitherto we feared thee
as a man: henceforth thou art exalted above the nature of mortals. And
he saw an angel standing over him, and he smote him as unto death. <span

End of the Letter of Pilate to Herod.

#### THE EPISTLE OF PONTIUS PILATE,

<span class="smallcaps">Which he Wrote to the Roman Emperor Concerning
our Lord Jesus Christ.</span>

*Pontius Pilate to Tiberius Cæsar—Greeting:*

UPON Jesus Christ, whom I fully made known to thee in my last, a bitter
punishment hath at length been inflicted by the will of the people,
although I was unwilling and apprehensive. In good truth, no age ever
had or will have a man so good and strict. But the people made a
wonderful

<span id="page_273">p. 273</span>

effort, and all their scribes, chiefs and elders agreed to crucify this
ambassador of truth, their own prophets, like the Sibyls with us,
advising the contrary; and when he was hanged supernatural signs
appeared, and in the judgment of philosophers menaced the whole world
with ruin. His disciples flourish, not belying their master by their
behavior and continence of life; nay, in his name they are most
beneficent. <span id="fr_1435"></span>[1](#fn_1427.md) Had I not feared a
sedition might arise among the people, who were almost furious, perhaps
this man would have yet been living with us. Although, being rather
compelled by fidelity to thy dignity, than led by my own inclination, I
did not strive with all my might to prevent the sale and suffering of
righteous blood, guiltless of every accusation, unjustly, indeed,
through the maliciousness of men, and yet, as the Scriptures interpret,
to their own destruction.

Farewell. The 5th of the Calends of April.

#### THE REPORT OF PILATE THE GOVERNOR,

<span class="smallcaps">Concerning our Lord Jesus Christ; which was Sent
to Augustus Cæsar, in Rome.</span>

IN those days, when our Lord Jesus Christ was crucified under Pontius
Pilate, the governor of Palestine and Phoenicia, the things here
recorded came to pass in Jerusalem, and were done by the Jews against
the Lord. Pilate therefore sent the same to Cæsar in Rome, along with
his private report, writing thus:

To the most potent, august, divine and awful Augustus Cæsar, Pilate, the
administrator of the Eastern Province:

I have received information, most excellent one, in consequence of which
I am seized with fear and trembling. For in this province which I
administer, one of whose cities is called Jerusalem, the whole multitude
of Jews delivered unto me a certain man called Jesus, and brought many
accusations against him, which they were unable to establish by
consistent evidence. But they charged him with one heresy in particular,
namely, That Jesus said the Sabbath was not a rest, nor to be observed
by them. For he performed many cures on that day, and made the blind
see, and the lame walk, raised the dead, cleansed lepers, healed the
paralytic who were wholly unable to move their body or brace their
nerves, but could only speak and discourse, and he gave them power to
walk and run, removing their infirmity by his word alone. There is
another very mighty deed which is strange to the gods we have: he raised
up a man who had been four days dead, summoning him by his word alone,
when the dead man had begun to decay, and his body was corrupted by the
worms which had been bred, and had the stench of a dog; but, seeing him
lying in the

<span id="page_274">p. 274</span>

tomb he commanded him to run, nor did the dead man at all delay, but as
a bridegroom out of his chamber, so did he go forth from his tomb,
filled with abundant perfume. Moreover, even such as were strangers, and
clearly demoniacs, who had their dwelling in deserts, and devoured their
own flesh, and wandered about like cattle and creeping things, he turned
into inhabiters of cities, and by a word rendered them rational, and
prepared them to become wise and powerful, and illustrious, taking their
food with all the enemies of the unclean spirits which were destructive
in them, and which he cast into the depth of the sea.

And, again, there was another who had a withered hand, and not only the
hand but rather the half of the body of the man was like a stone, and he
had neither the shape of a man nor the symmetry of a body: even him He
healed with a word and rendered whole. And a woman also, who had an
issue of blood for a long time, and whose veins and arteries were
exhausted, and who did not bear a human body, being like one dead, and
daily speechless, so that all the physicians of the district were unable
to cure her, for there remained unto her not a hope of life; but as
Jesus passed by she mysteriously received strength by his shadow falling
on her, from behind she touched the hem of his garment, and immediately,
in that very hour, strength filled her exhausted limbs, and as if she
had never suffered anything, she began to run along towards Capernaum,
her own city, so that she reached it in a six days’ journey.

And I have made known these things which I have recently been informed
of, and which Jesus did on the Sabbath. And he did other miracles
greater than these, so that I have observed greater works of wonder done
by him than by the gods whom we worship.

But Herod and Archelaus and Philip, Annas and Caiaphas, with all the
people, delivered him to me, making a great tumult against me in order
that I might try him. Therefore, I commanded him to be crucified, when I
had first scourged him, though I found no cause in him for evil
accusations or dealings.

Now when he was crucified, there was darkness over all the world, and
the sun was obscured for half a day, and the stars appeared, but no
lustre was seen in them; and the moon lost its brightness, as though
tinged with blood; and the world of the departed was swallowed up; so
that the very sanctuary of the temple, as they call it, did not appear
to the Jews themselves at their fall, but they perceived a chasm in the
earth, and the rolling of successive thunders. And amid this terror the
dead appeared rising again, as the Jews themselves bore witness, and
said that it was Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and the twelve
patriarchs, and Moses, and Job, who had died before, as they say, some
three thousand five hundred years. And there were very many whom I
myself saw appearing in the body, and they made lamentation

<span id="page_275">p. 275</span>

over the Jews, because of the transgression which was committed by them,
and because of the destruction of the Jews and of their law.

And the terror of the earthquake continued from the sixth hour of the
preparation until the ninth hour; and when it was evening on the first
day of the week, there came a sound from heaven, and the heaven became
seven times more luminous than on all other days. And at the third hour
of the night the sun appeared more luminous than it had ever shone,
lighting up the whole hemisphere. And as lightning-flashes suddenly come
forth in a storm, so there were seen men, lofty in stature, and
surpassing in glory, a countless host, crying out, and their voice was
heard as that of exceedingly loud thunder, Jesus that was crucified is
risen again: come up from Hades ye that were enslaved in the
subterraneous recesses of Hades. And the chasm in the earth was as if it
had no bottom; but it was so that the very foundations of the earth
appeared, with those that shouted in heaven, and walked in the body
among the dead that were raised. And He that raised up all the dead and
bound Hades said, Say to my disciples He goeth before you into Galilee,
there shall ye see Him.

And all that night the light ceased not shining. And many of the Jews
died in the chasm of the earth, being swallowed up, so that on the
morrow most of those who had been against Jesus were not to be found.
Others saw the apparition of men rising again whom none of us had ever
seen. One synagogue of the Jews was alone left in Jerusalem itself, for
they all disappeared in that ruin.

Therefore being astounded by that terror, and being possessed with the
most dreadful trembling, I have written what I saw at that time and sent
it to thine excellency; and I have inserted what was done against Jesus
by the Jews, and sent it to thy divinity, my lord.

#### THE REPORT OF PONTIUS PILATE,

<span class="smallcaps">Governor of Judea;</span>

*Which was sent to Tiberius Cæsar in Rome*.

To the most potent, august, dreadful, and divine Augustus, Pontius
Pilate, administrator of the Eastern Province.

I HAVE undertaken to communicate to thy goodness by this my writing,
though possessed with much fear and trembling, most excellent king, the
present state of affairs, as the result hath shown. For as I
administered this province, my lord, according to the command of thy
serenity, which is one of the eastern cities called Jerusalem, wherein
the temple of the nation of the Jews is erected, all the multitude of
the Jews, being assembled, delivered up to me a certain man called
Jesus, bringing many and endless accusations against

<span id="page_276">p. 276</span>

him; but they could not convict him in anything. But they had one heresy
against him, that he said the sabbath was not their proper rest.

Now that man wrought many cures and good works: he caused the blind to
see, he cleansed lepers, he raised the dead, he healed paralytics, who
could not move at all, but had only voice, and all their bones in their
places; and he gave them strength to walk and run, enjoining it by his
word alone. And he did another yet more mighty work, which had been
strange even among our gods, he raised from the dead one Lazarus, who
had been dead four days, commanding by a word alone that the dead man
should be raised, when his body was already corrupted by worms which
bred in his wounds. And he commanded the fetid body, which lay in the
grave, to run, and as bridegroom from his chamber so he went forth from
his grave, full of sweet perfume. And some that were grievously
afflicted by demons, and had their dwellings in desert places, and
devoured the flesh of their own limbs, and went up and down among
creeping things and wild beasts, he caused to dwell in cities in their
own houses, and by a word made them reasonable, and caused to become
wise and honorable those that were vexed by unclean spirits, and the
demons that were in them he sent out into a herd of swine into the sea
and drowned them. Again, another who had a withered hand, and lived in
suffering, and had not even the half of his body sound, he made whole by
a word alone. And a woman who had an issue of blood for a long time, so
that because of the discharge all the joints of her bones were seen and
shone through like glass, for all the physicians had dismissed her
without hope, and had not cleansed her, for there was in her no hope of
health at all; but once, as Jesus was passing by she touched from behind
the hem of his garments, and in that very hour the strength of her body
was restored, and she was made whole, as if she had no affliction, and
began to run fast towards her own city of Paneas. And these things
happened thus: but the Jews reported that Jesus did these things on the
sabbath. And I saw that greater marvels had been wrought by him than by
the gods whom we worship. Him then Herod and Archelaus and Philip, and
Annas and Caiaphas, with all the people, delivered up to me, to put him
on his trial. And because many raised a tumult against me, I commanded
that he should be crucified.

Now when he was crucified darkness came over all the world; the sun was
altogether hidden, and the sky appeared dark while it was yet day, so
that the stars were seen, though still they had their lustre obscured,
wherefore, I suppose your excellency is not unaware that in all the
world they lighted their lamps from the sixth hour until evening. And
the moon, which was like blood, did not shine all night long, although
it was at the full, and the stars and Orion made lamentation over the

<span id="page_277">p. 277</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Jews, because of
the transgression committed by them.

And on the first day of the week, about the third hour of the night, the
sun appeared as it never shone before, and the whole heaven became
bright. And as lightnings come in a storm, so certain men of lofty
stature, in beautiful array, and of indescribable glory, appeared in the
air, and a countless host of angels, crying out and saying, Glory to God
in the highest, and on earth peace, good will among men: Come up from
Hades, ye who are in bondage in the depths of Hades. And at their voice
all the mountains and hills were moved, and the rocks were rent, and
great chasms were made in the earth, so that the very places of the
abyss were visible.

And amid the terror dead men were seen rising again, so that the Jews
who saw it said, We beheld Abraham and Isaac, and Jacob, and the twelve
patriarchs, who died some two thousand five hundred years before, and we
beheld Noah clearly in the body. And all the multitude walked about and
sang hymns to God with a loud voice, saying, The Lord our God, who hath
risen from the dead, hath made alive all the dead, and Hades he hath
spoiled and slain.

Therefore, my lord king, all that night the light ceased not. But many
of the Jews died, and were sunk and swallowed up in the chasms that
night, so that not even their bodies were to be seen. Now I mean, that
those of the Jews suffered who spake against Jesus. And but one
synagogue remained in Jerusalem, for all the synagogues which had been
against Jesus were overwhelmed.

Through that terror, therefore, being amazed and being seized with great
trembling, in that very hour, I ordered what had been done by them all
to be written, and I have sent it to thy mightiness.

#### THE TRIAL AND CONDEMNATION OF PILATE. <span id="fr_1436"></span>[1](#fn_1428.md)

NOW when the letters came to the city of the Romans, and were read to
Cæsar with no few standing there, they were all terrified, because,
through the transgression of Pilate, the darkness and the earthquake had
happened to all the world. And Cæsar, being filled with anger, sent
soldiers and commanded that Pilate should be brought as a prisoner.

And when he was brought to the city of the Romans, and Cæsar heard that
he was come, he sat in the temple of the gods, above all the senate, and
with all the army, and with all the multitude of his power, and
commanded that Pilate should stand in the entrance. And Cæsar said to
him, Most impious one, when thou sawest so great signs done by that man,
why didst thou dare to do thus? By daring to do an evil deed thou hast
ruined all the world.

<span id="page_278">p. 278</span>

And Pilate said, King and Autocrat, I am not guilty of these things, but
it is the multitude of the Jews who are precipitate and guilty. And
Cæsar said, And who are they? Pilate saith, Herod, Archelaus, Philip,
Annas and Caiaphas, and all the multitude of the Jews. Cæsar saith, For
what cause didst thou execute their purpose? And Pilate said, Their
nation is seditious and insubordinate, and not submissive to thy power.
And Cæsar said, When they delivered him to thee thou oughtest to have
made him secure and sent him to me, and not consented to them to crucify
such a man, who was just and wrought such great and good miracles, as
thou saidst in thy report. <span id="fr_1437"></span>[1](#fn_1429.md) For
by such miracles Jesus was manifested to be the Christ, the King of the
Jews.

And when Cæsar said this and himself named the name of Christ, all the
multitude of the gods fell down together, and became like dust where
Cæsar sat with the senate. And all the people that stood near Cæsar were
filled with trembling because of the utterance of the word and the fall
of their gods, and being seized with fear they all went away, every man
to his house, wondering at what had happened. And Cæsar commanded Pilate
to be safely kept, that he might know the truth about Jesus.

And on the morrow when Cæsar sat in the capitol with all the senate, he
undertook to question Pilate again. And Cæsar said, Say the truth, most
impious one, for through thy impious deed which thou didst commit
against Jesus, even here the doing of thy evil works were manifested, in
that the gods were brought to ruin. Say then, who is he that was
crucified, for his name hath destroyed all the gods? Pilate said, And
verily his records are true; for even I myself was convinced by his
works that he was greater than all the gods whom we venerate. And Cæsar
said, For what cause then didst thou perpetrate against him such daring
and doing, not being ignorant of him, or assuredly designing some
mischief to my government? And Pilate said, I did it because of the
transgression and sedition of the lawless and ungodly Jews. <span
id="fr_1438"></span>[2](#fn_1430.md)

And Cæsar was filled with anger, and held a council with all his senate
and officers, and ordered a decree to be written against the Jews thus:—

To Licianus who holdeth the first place in the East Country. Greeting:

I have been informed of the audacity perpetrated very recently by the
Jews inhabiting Jerusalem and the cities round about, and their lawless
doing, how they compelled Pilate to crucify a certain god called Jesus,
through which great transgression of theirs the world was darkened and
drawn into ruin. Determine therefore, with a body of soldiers, to go to
them there at once and proclaim their subjection to bondage by this
decree. By obeying and proceeding against

<span id="page_279">p. 279</span>

them, and scattering them abroad in all nations, enslave them, and by
driving their nation from all Judea as soon as possible show, wherever
this hath not yet appeared, that they are full of evil.

And when this decree came into the East Country, Licianus obeyed,
through fear of the decree, and laid waste all the nation of the Jews,
and caused those that were left in Judea, to go into slavery with them
that were scattered among the Gentiles, that it might be known by Cæsar
that these things had been done by Licianus against the Jews in the East
Country, and to please him.

And again Cæsar resolved to have Pilate questioned, and commanded a
captain, Albius by name, to cut off Pilate's head, saying, As he laid
hands upon the just man, that is called Christ, he also shall fall in
like manner, and find no deliverance.

And when Pilate came to the place he prayed in silence, saying, O Lord,
destroy not me with the wicked Hebrews, for I should not have laid hands
upon thee, but for the nation of lawless Jews, because they provoked
sedition against mss but thou knowest that I did it in ignorance.
Destroy me not, therefore, for this my sin, nor be mindful of the evil
that is in me, O Lord, and in thy servant Procla who standeth with me in
this the hour of my death, whom thou taughtest to prophecy that thou
must be nailed to the cross. Do not punish her too in my sin, but
forgive us, and number us in the portion of thy just ones. And behold,
when Pilate had finished his prayer, there came a voice from heaven,
saying, All generations and the families of the Gentiles shall call thee
blessed, because under thee were fulfilled all these things that were
spoken by the prophets concerning me; and thou thyself must appear as my
witness at my second coming, when I shall judge the twelve tribes of
Israel, and them that have not confessed my name. And the Prefect cut
off the head of Pilate, and behold an angel of the Lord received it. And
when his wife Procla saw the angel coming and receiving his head, she
also, being filled with joy, forthwith gave up the ghost, and was buried
with her husband. <span id="fr_1439"></span>[1](#fn_1431.md)

#### THE DEATH OF PILATE,

WHO CONDEMNED JESUS.

NOW whereas Tiberius Cæsar emperor of the Romans was suffering from a
grievous sickness, and hearing that there was at Jerusalem a certain
physician, Jesus by name, who healed all diseases by his word alone; not
knowing that

<span id="page_280">p. 280</span>

the Jews and Pilate had put him to death, he thus bade one of his
attendants, Volusianus by name, saying, Go as quickly as thou canst
across the sea, and tell Pilate, my servant and friend, to send me this
physician to restore me to my original health. And Volusianus, having
heard the order of the emperor, immediately departed, and came to
Pilate, as it was commanded him. And he told the same Pilate what had
been committed to him by Tiberius Cæsar, saying, Tiberius Cæsar, emperor
of the Romans, thy Lord, having heard that in this city there is a
physician who healeth diseases by his word alone, earnestly entreateth
thee to send him to him to heal his disease. And Pilate was greatly
terrified on hearing this, knowing that through envy he had caused him
to be slain. Pilate answered the messenger, saying thus, This man was a
malefactor, and a man who drew after himself all the people; so, after
counsel taken of the wise men of the city, I caused him to be crucified.
And as the messenger returned to his lodgings he met a certain woman
named Veronica, who had been acquainted with Jesus, and he said, O
woman, there was a certain physician in this city, who healed the sick
by his word alone, why have the Jews slain him? And she began to weep,
saying, Ah, me, my lord, it was my God and my Lord whom Pilate through
envy delivered up, condemned, and commanded to be crucified. Then he,
grieving greatly, said, I am exceedingly sorry that I cannot fulfil that
for which my lord hath sent me.

Veronica said to him, When my Lord went about preaching, and I was very
unwillingly deprived of his presence, I desired to have his picture
painted for me, that while I was deprived of his presence, at least the
figure of his likeness might give me consolation. And when I was taking
the canvas to the painter to be painted, my Lord met me and asked
whither I was going. And when I had made known to him the cause of my
journey, He asked me for the canvas, and gave it back to me printed with
the likeness of his venerable face. Therefore, if thy lord will devoutly
look upon the sight of this, he will straightway enjoy the benefit of
health.

Is a likeness of this kind to be procured with gold or silver? he asked.
No, said she, but with a pious sentiment of devotion. Therefore, I will
go with thee, and carry the likeness to Cæsar to look upon, and will
return.

So Volusianus came with Veronica to Rome, and said to Tiberius the
emperor, Jesus, whom thou hast long desired, Pilate and the Jews have
surrendered to an unjust death, and through envy fastened to the wood of
the cross. Therefore, a certain matron hath come with me bringing the
likeness of the same Jesus, and if thou wilt devoutly gaze upon it, thou
wilt presently obtain the benefit of thy health. So Cæsar caused the way
to be spread with cloths of silk, and ordered the portrait to be
presented to him; and as soon as he had looked upon

it he regained his original health.

Then Pontius Pilate was apprehended by command of Cæsar and brought to
Rome. Cæsar, hearing that Pilate had come to Rome, was filled with
exceeding wrath against him, and caused him to be brought to him. Now
Pilate brought with him the seamless coat of Jesus, and wore it when
before the emperor. As soon as the emperor saw him he laid aside all his
wrath, and forthwith rose to him, and was unable to speak harshly to him
in anything: and he who in his absence seemed so terrible and fierce now
in his presence is found comparatively gentle.

And when he had dismissed him, he soon became terribly inflamed against
him, declaring himself wretched, because he had not expressed to him the
anger of his bosom. And immediately he had him recalled, swearing and
protesting that he was a child of death, and unfitted to live upon
earth. And when he saw him he instantly greeted him, and laid aside all
the fury of his mind.

All were astonished, and he was astonished himself, that he was so
enraged against Pilate while absent, and could say nothing to him
sharply while he was present. At length, by Divine suggestion, or
perhaps by the persuasion of some Christian, he had him stripped of the
coat, and soon resumed against him his original fury of mind. And when
the emperor was wondering very much about this, they told him it had
been the coat of the Lord Jesus. Then the emperor commanded him to be
kept in prison till he should take counsel with the wise men what ought
to be done with him. And after a few days sentence was given against
Pilate that he should be condemned to the most ignominious death. When
Pilate heard this he slew himself with his own dagger, and by such a
death put an end to his life.

When Pilate's death was made known Cæsar said, Truly he has died a most
ignominious death, whose own hand has not spared him. He was therefore
fastened to a great block of stone and sunk in the river Tiber. But
wicked and unclean spirits, rejoicing in his wicked and unclean body,
all moved about in the water, and caused in the air dreadful lightning
and tempests, thunder and hail, so that all were seized with horrible
fear. On which account the Romans dragged him out of the river Tiber,
bore him away in derision to Vienne, and sunk him in the river Rhone.
For Vienne means, as it were, Way of Gehenna, because it was then a
place of cursing. And evil spirits were there and did the same things.

Those men, therefore, not enduring to be so harassed by demons, removed
the vessel of cursing from them and sent it to be buried in the
territory of Losania. But when they were troubled exceedingly by the
aforesaid vexations, they put it away from them and sunk it in a certain
pool surrounded by mountains, where even yet, according to the account
of some, sundry diabolical contrivances are said to issue forth.

the Greeks, under Oct. 28th, intimate the commemoration of Procla, the
wife of Pilate. The Æthiopic calendar inserts 'Pilate and his wife
Procla' under June 25th. The reason for putting these names among the
saints is, that Pilate by washing his hands attested the innocence of
Jesus, while Procla sought to dissuade her husband from complying with
the Jews. The above story makes of Pilate almost a martyr; and
Tertullian makes him almost a saint in Apol. c. Gentes, cap. 21.
