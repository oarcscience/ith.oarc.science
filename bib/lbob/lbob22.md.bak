### The EPISTLE of IGNATIUS to the PHILADELPHIANS.

#### CHAP. I.

<span class="small">*Commends their bishop whom they had sent unto him,*
5 *warns them against divisions and schism*.</span>

IGNATIUS, who is also called Theophorus, to the church of God the
Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ, which is at Philadelphia in Asia;
which has obtained mercy, being fixed in the concord of God, and
rejoicing  <span id="fr_1028"></span>[8](#fn_1028.md) evermore in the
passion of our Lord, and being fulfilled in all mercy through his
resurrection: Which also I salute in the blood of Jesus Christ,  <span
id="fr_1029"></span>[9](#fn_1029.md) which is our eternal and undefiled
joy; especially if they are at unity with the bishop, and presbyters who
are with him, and the deacons appointed  <span
id="fr_1030"></span>[10](#fn_1030.md) according to the  <span
id="fr_1031"></span>[11](#fn_1031.md) mind of Jesus Christ; whom he has
settled according to his own will in all firmness by his Holy Spirit:

2 Which bishop I know obtained  <span id="fr_1032"></span>[12](#fn_1032.md)
that great ministry among you, not of himself, neither by men, nor out
of vain glory; but  <span id="fr_1033"></span>[13](#fn_1033.md) by the love
of God the Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ.

3 Whose moderation  <span id="fr_1034"></span>[14](#fn_1034.md) I admire;
who by his silence is able to do more than  <span
id="fr_1035"></span>[15](#fn_1035.md) others with all their vain talk. For
he is fitted to the commands, as the harp to its strings.

4 Wherefore my soul esteems his mind towards God most happy,

<span id="page_183">p. 183</span>

knowing it to be fruitful in all virtue, and perfect; full of constancy,
free from passion,  <span id="fr_1036"></span>[1](#fn_1036.md) and
according to all the moderation of the living God.

5 Wherefore as becomes the children both of the light and of truth; flee
divisions and false doctrines; but where your shepherd is, there do ye,
as sheep, follow after.

6 For there are many wolves  <span id="fr_1037"></span>[2](#fn_1037.md) who
seem worthy of belief with a  <span id="fr_1038"></span>[3](#fn_1038.md)
false pleasure lead captive those that run in the course of God; but in
the concord they shall find no place.

7 Abstain therefore from evil herbs which Jesus does not dress; because
such are not the plantation of the Father. Not that I have found any
division among you, but rather all manner of  <span
id="fr_1039"></span>[4](#fn_1039.md) purity.

8 For as many as are of God, and of Jesus Christ, are also with their
bishop. And as many as shall with repentance return into the unity of
the church, even these shall also be the servants of God, that they may
live according to Jesus.

9 Be not deceived, brethren; if any one follows him that makes a schism
in the church, he shall not inherit the kingdom of God. If any one walks
after any other opinion, he agrees not with the passion of Christ.

10 Wherefore let it be your endeavour to partake all of the same holy
eucharist.

11 For there is but one flesh of our Lord Jesus Christ; and one cup in
the unity of his blood; one altar;

12 As also there is one bishop, together with his presbytery, and the
deacons my fellow-servants: that so whatsoever ye do, ye may do it
according to the will of God.

#### CHAP. II.

<span class="small">*Desires their prayers, and to be united but not to
Judaize*.</span>

MY brethren, the love I have towards you makes me the  <span
id="fr_1040"></span>[5](#fn_1040.md) more large; and having a great joy in
you, I endeavour to secure you against danger; or rather not I, but
Jesus Christ; in whom being bound I the more fear, as being yet only
 <span id="fr_1041"></span>[6](#fn_1041.md) on the way to suffering.

2 But your prayer to God shall make me perfect, that I may attain to
that portion, which by God's mercy is allotted to me: Fleeing to the
Gospel as to the flesh of Christ; and to the Apostles as to the
presbytery of the church.

3 Let us also love the prophets, forasmuch as they also have  <span
id="fr_1042"></span>[7](#fn_1042.md) led us to the Gospel, and to hope in
 <span id="fr_1043"></span>[8](#fn_1043.md) Christ, and to expect him.

4 In whom also believing they were saved in the unity of Jesus Christ;
being holy men, worthy to be loved, and had in wonder;

5 Who have received testimony from Jesus Christ, and are numbered in the
Gospel of our common hope.

6 But if any one shall preach the  <span
id="fr_1044"></span>[9](#fn_1044.md) Jewish law unto you, hearken not unto
him; for  <span id="fr_1045"></span>[10](#fn_1045.md) it is better to
receive the doctrine of Christ from one that has been circumcised, than
Judaism from one that has not.

<span id="page_184">p. 184</span>

7 But if either the one, or other, do not speak concerning Christ Jesus,
they seem to me to be but as monuments and sepulchres of the dead, upon
which are written only the names of men.

8 Flee therefore the wicked arts and snares of the prince of this world;
lest at any time being oppressed by his cunning ye grow  <span
id="fr_1046"></span>[1](#fn_1046.md) cold in your charity. But come all
together into the same place with an undivided heart.

9 And I bless my God that I have a good conscience towards you, and that
no one among you has whereof to boast either openly or privately, that I
have been burthensome to him in much or little.

10 And I wish to all among whom I have conversed, that it may not turn
to a witness against them.

11 For although some would have deceived me according to the flesh, yet
the spirit, being from God, is not deceived; for it knows both whence it
comes and whither it goes, and reproves the secrets of the heart.

12 I cried whilst I was among you; I spake with a loud voice: attend to
the bishop, and to the presbytery, and to the deacons.

13 Now some supposed that I spake this as foreseeing the division  <span
id="fr_1047"></span>[2](#fn_1047.md) that should come among you.

14 But he is my witness for whose sake I am in bonds that I knew nothing
from any man. But the spirit spake, saying on this wise: Do nothing
without the bishop:

15 Keep your  <span id="fr_1048"></span>[3](#fn_1048.md) bodies as the
temples of God: Love unity; Flee divisions; Be the followers of Christ,
as he was of his Father.

16 I therefore did as became me, as a man composed to unity. For where
there is division, and wrath, God dwelleth not.

17 But the Lord forgives all that repent, if they  <span
id="fr_1049"></span>[4](#fn_1049.md) return to the unity of God, and to the
council of the bishop.

18 For I trust in the grace of Jesus Christ  <span
id="fr_1050"></span>[5](#fn_1050.md) that he will free you from every bond.

19 Nevertheless I exhort you that you do nothing out of strife, but
according to the instruction of Christ.

20 Because I have heard of some who say; unless I find it written in the
 <span id="fr_1051"></span>[6](#fn_1051.md) originals, I will not believe
it to be written in the Gospel. And when I said, It is written; they
answered what lay before them in their corrupted copies.

21 But to me Jesus Christ is instead of all the uncorrupted monuments in
the world; together with those  <span id="fr_1052"></span>[7](#fn_1052.md)
undefiled monuments, his cross, and death, and resurrection, and the
faith which is by him; by which I desire, through your prayers, to be
justified.

22 ¶ The priests indeed are good; but much better is the High Priest to
whom the Holy of Holies has been committed; and who alone has been
entrusted with the secrets of God.

23 He is the door of the Father; by which Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob,
and all the prophets, enter in; as well as the Apostles, and the church.

<span id="page_185">p. 185</span>

24 And all these things tend to the unity which is of God. Howbeit the
Gospel has some. what in it far above all other dispensations; namely,
the appearance of our Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ, his passion and
resurrection.

25 For the beloved prophets referred to him; but the gospel is the
perfection of incorruption. All therefore together are good, if ye
believe with charity.

#### CHAP. III.

<span class="small">*Informs them he had heard that the persecution was
stopped at Antioch, and directs them to send a messenger hitherto to
congratulate with the church*.</span>

NOW as concerning the church of Antioch which is in Syria, seeing I am
told that through your prayers and the bowels which ye have towards it
in Jesus Christ, it is in peace; it will become you, as the church of
God, to ordain some  <span id="fr_1053"></span>[1](lbob23.htm#fn_1053.md)
deacon to go to them thither as the ambassador of God; that he may
rejoice with them when they meet together, and glorify God's name.

2 Blessed be that man in Jesus Christ, who shall be found worthy of such
a ministry; and ye yourselves also shall be glorified.

3 Now if you be willing, it is not impossible for you to do this for the
grace of God; as also the other neighbouring churches have sent them,
some bishops, some priests and deacons.

4 As concerning Philo the deacon of Cilicia, a most worthy  <span
id="fr_1054"></span>[2](lbob23.htm#fn_1054.md) man, he still ministers unto
me in the word of God: together with Rheus  <span
id="fr_1055"></span>[3](lbob23.htm#fn_1055.md) of Agathopolis, a singular
good person, who has followed me even from Syria, not regarding his
life: These also bear witness unto you.

5 And I myself give thanks to God for you that you receive them as the
Lord shall receive you. But for those that dishonoured them, may they be
forgiven through the grace of Jesus Christ.

6 The charity of the brethren that are at Troas salutes you: from whence
also I now write by Burrhus, who was sent together with me by those of
Ephesus and Smyrna, for respect sake.

7 May our Lord Jesus Christ honour them; in whom they hope, both in
flesh, and soul, and spirit; in faith, in love, in unity. Farewell in
Christ Jesus our common hope.
