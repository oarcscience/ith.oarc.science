### Douay-Rheims Bible: Philippians

<span id="an_1:1">1:1</span> Paul and Timothy, the servants of Jesus
Christ; to all the saints in Christ Jesus, who are at Philippi, with the
bishops and deacons.

<span id="an_1:2">1:2</span> Grace be unto you, and peace from God our
Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.

<span id="an_1:3">1:3</span> I give thanks to my God in every
remembrance of you,

<span id="an_1:4">1:4</span> Always in all my prayers making
supplication for you all, with joy;

<span id="an_1:5">1:5</span> For your communication in the gospel of
Christ from the first day until now.

<span id="an_1:6">1:6</span> Being confident of this very thing, that
he, who hath begun a good work in you, will perfect it unto the day of
Christ Jesus.

<span id="an_1:7">1:7</span> As it is meet for me to think this for you
all, for that I have you in my heart; and that in my bands, and in the
defence and confirmation of the gospel, you all are partakers of my joy.

<span id="an_1:8">1:8</span> For God is my witness, how I long after you
all in the bowels of Jesus Christ.

<span id="an_1:9">1:9</span> And this I pray, that your charity may more
and more abound in knowledge, and in all understanding:

<span id="an_1:10">1:10</span> That you may approve the better things,
that you may be sincere and without offence unto the day of Christ,

<span id="an_1:11">1:11</span> Filled with the fruit of justice, through
Jesus Christ, unto the glory and praise of God.

<span id="an_1:12">1:12</span> Now, brethren, I desire you should know,
that the things which have happened to me, have fallen out rather to the
furtherance of the gospel:

<span id="an_1:13">1:13</span> So that my bands are made manifest in
Christ, in all the court, and in all other places;

<span id="an_1:14">1:14</span> And many of the brethren in the Lord,
growing confident by my bands, are much more bold to speak the word of
God without fear.

<span id="an_1:15">1:15</span> Some indeed, even out of envy and
contention; but some also for good will preach Christ.

<span id="an_1:16">1:16</span> Some out of charity, knowing that I am
set for the defence of the gospel.

<span id="an_1:17">1:17</span> And some out of contention preach Christ
not sincerely: supposing that they raise affliction to my bands.

<span id="an_1:18">1:18</span> But what then? So that by all means,
whether by occasion, or by truth, Christ be preached: in this also I
rejoice, yea, and will rejoice.

<span id="an_1:19">1:19</span> For I know that this shall fall out to me
unto salvation, through your prayer, and the supply of the Spirit of
Jesus Christ,

<span id="an_1:20">1:20</span> According to my expectation and hope;
that in nothing I shall be confounded, but with all confidence, as
always, so now also shall Christ be magnified in my body, wither it be
by life, or by death.

<span id="an_1:21">1:21</span> For to me, to live is Christ; and to die
is gain.

<span id="an_1:22">1:22</span> And if to live in the flesh, that is to
me the fruit of labour, and what I shall choose I know not.

<span id="an_1:23">1:23</span> But I am straitened between two: having a
desire to be dissolved and to be with Christ, a thing by far the better.

<span id="an_1:24">1:24</span> But to abide still in the flesh, is
needful for you.

<span id="an_1:25">1:25</span> And having this confidence, I know that I
shall abide, and continue with you all, for your furtherance and joy of
faith:

<span id="an_1:26">1:26</span> That your rejoicing may abound in Christ
Jesus for me, by my coming to you again.

<span id="an_1:27">1:27</span> Only let your conversation be worthy of
the gospel of Christ: that, whether I come and see you, or, being
absent, may hear of you, that you stand fast in one spirit, with one
mind labouring together for the faith of the gospel.

<span id="an_1:28">1:28</span> And in nothing be ye terrified by the
adversaries: which to them is a cause of perdition, but to you of
salvation, and this from God:

<span id="an_1:29">1:29</span> For unto you it is given for Christ, not
only to believe in him, but also to suffer for him.

<span id="an_1:30">1:30</span> Having the same conflict as that which
you have seen in me, and now have heard of me.

<span id="an_2:1">2:1</span> If there be therefore any consolation in
Christ, if any comfort of charity, if any society of the spirit, if any
bowels of commiseration:

<span id="an_2:2">2:2</span> Fulfil ye my joy, that you may be of one
mind, having the same charity, being of one accord, agreeing in
sentiment.

<span id="an_2:3">2:3</span> Let nothing be done through contention,
neither by vain glory: but in humility, let each esteem others better
than themselves:

<span id="an_2:4">2:4</span> Each one not considering the things that
are his own, but those that are other men's.

<span id="an_2:5">2:5</span> For let this mind be in you, which was also
in Christ Jesus:

<span id="an_2:6">2:6</span> Who being in the form of God, thought it
not robbery to be equal with God:

<span id="an_2:7">2:7</span> But emptied himself, taking the form of a
servant, being made in the likeness of men, and in habit found as a man.

<span id="an_2:8">2:8</span> He humbled himself, becoming obedient unto
death, even to the death of the cross.

<span id="an_2:9">2:9</span> For which cause God also hath exalted him,
and hath given him a name which is above all names:

<span id="an_2:10">2:10</span> That in the name of Jesus every knee
should bow, of those that are in heaven, on earth, and under the earth:

<span id="an_2:11">2:11</span> And that every tongue should confess that
the Lord Jesus Christ is in the glory of God the Father.

<span id="an_2:12">2:12</span> Wherefore, my dearly beloved, (as you
have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but much more now in my
absence,) with fear and trembling work out your salvation.

<span id="an_2:13">2:13</span> For it is God who worketh in you, both to
will and to accomplish, according to his good will.

<span id="an_2:14">2:14</span> And do ye all things without murmurings
and hesitations;

<span id="an_2:15">2:15</span> That you may be blameless, and sincere
children of God, without reproof, in the midst of a crooked and perverse
generation; among whom you shine as lights in the world.

<span id="an_2:16">2:16</span> Holding forth the word of life to my
glory in the day of Christ, because I have not run in vain, nor laboured
in vain.

<span id="an_2:17">2:17</span> Yea, and if I be made a victim upon the
sacrifice and service of your faith, I rejoice, and congratulate with
you all.

<span id="an_2:18">2:18</span> And for the selfsame thing do you also
rejoice, and congratulate with me.

<span id="an_2:19">2:19</span> And I hope in the Lord Jesus to send
Timothy unto you shortly, that I also may be of good comfort, when I
know the things concerning you.

<span id="an_2:20">2:20</span> For I have no man so of the same mind,
who with sincere affection is solicitous for you.

<span id="an_2:21">2:21</span> For all seek the things that are their
own; not the things that are Jesus Christ's.

<span id="an_2:22">2:22</span> Now know ye the proof of him, that as a
son with the father, so hath he served with me in the gospel.

<span id="an_2:23">2:23</span> Him therefore I hope to send unto you
immediately, so soon as I shall see how it will go with me.

<span id="an_2:24">2:24</span> And I trust in the Lord, that I myself
also shall come to you shortly.

<span id="an_2:25">2:25</span> But I have thought it necessary to send
to you Epaphroditus, my brother and fellow labourer, and fellow soldier,
but your apostle, and he that hath ministered to my wants.

<span id="an_2:26">2:26</span> For indeed he longed after you all: and
was sad, for that you had heard that he was sick.

<span id="an_2:27">2:27</span> For indeed he was sick, nigh unto death;
but God had mercy on him; and not only on him, but on me also, lest I
should have sorrow upon sorrow.

<span id="an_2:28">2:28</span> Therefore I sent him the more speedily:
that seeing him again, you may rejoice, and I may be without sorrow.

<span id="an_2:29">2:29</span> Receive him therefore with all joy in the
Lord; and treat with honour such as he is.

<span id="an_2:30">2:30</span> Because for the work of Christ he came to
the point of death: delivering his life, that he might fulfil that which
on your part was wanting towards my service.

<span id="an_3:1">3:1</span> As to the rest, my brethren, rejoice in the
Lord. To write the same things to you, to me indeed is not wearisome,
but to you it is necessary.

<span id="an_3:2">3:2</span> Beware of dogs, beware of evil workers,
beware of the concision.

<span id="an_3:3">3:3</span> For we are the circumcision, who in spirit
serve God; and glory in Christ Jesus, not having confidence in the
flesh.

<span id="an_3:4">3:4</span> Though I might also have confidence in the
flesh. If any other thinketh he may have confidence in the flesh, I
more,

<span id="an_3:5">3:5</span> Being circumcised the eighth day, of the
stock of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, an Hebrew of the Hebrews;
according to the law, a Pharisee:

<span id="an_3:6">3:6</span> According to zeal, persecuting the church
of God; according to the justice that is in the law, conversing without
blame.

<span id="an_3:7">3:7</span> But the things that were gain to me, the
same I have counted loss for Christ.

<span id="an_3:8">3:8</span> Furthermore I count all things to be but
loss for the excellent knowledge of Jesus Christ my Lord; for whom I
have suffered the loss of all things, and count them but as dung, that I
may gain Christ:

<span id="an_3:9">3:9</span> And may be found in him, not having my
justice, which is of the law, but that which is of the faith of Christ
Jesus, which is of God, justice in faith:

<span id="an_3:10">3:10</span> That I may know him, and the power of his
resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, being made
conformable to his death,

<span id="an_3:11">3:11</span> If by any means I may attain to the
resurrection which is from the dead.

<span id="an_3:12">3:12</span> Not as though I has already attained, or
were already perfect; but I follow after, if I may by any means
apprehend, wherein I am also apprehended by Christ Jesus.

<span id="an_3:13">3:13</span> Brethren, I do not count myself to have
apprehended. But one thing I do: forgetting the things that are behind,
and stretching forth myself to those that are before,

<span id="an_3:14">3:14</span> I press towards the mark, to the prize of
the supernal vocation of God in Christ Jesus.

<span id="an_3:15">3:15</span> Let us therefore, as many as are perfect,
be thus minded; and if in any thing you be otherwise minded, this also
God will reveal to you.

<span id="an_3:16">3:16</span> Nevertheless whereunto we are come, that
we be of the same mind, let us also continue in the same rule.

<span id="an_3:17">3:17</span> Be ye followers of me, brethren, and
observe them who walk so as you have our model.

<span id="an_3:18">3:18</span> For many walk, of whom I have told you
often (and now tell you weeping), that they are enemies of the cross of
Christ;

<span id="an_3:19">3:19</span> Whose end is destruction; whose God is
their belly; and whose glory is in their shame; who mind earthly things.

<span id="an_3:20">3:20</span> But our conversation is in heaven; from
whence also we look for the Saviour, our Lord Jesus Christ,

<span id="an_3:21">3:21</span> Who will reform the body of our lowness,
made like to the body of his glory, according to the operation whereby
also he is able to subdue all things unto himself.

<span id="an_4:1">4:1</span> Therefore, my dearly beloved brethren, and
most desired, my joy and my crown; so stand fast in the Lord, my dearly
beloved.

<span id="an_4:2">4:2</span> I beg of Evodia, and I beseech Syntyche, to
be of one mind in the Lord.

<span id="an_4:3">4:3</span> And I entreat thee also, my sincere
companion, help those women who have laboured with me in the gospel,
with Clement and the rest of my fellow labourers, whose names are in the
book of life.

<span id="an_4:4">4:4</span> Rejoice in the Lord always; again, I say,
rejoice.

<span id="an_4:5">4:5</span> Let your modesty be known to all men. The
Lord is nigh.

<span id="an_4:6">4:6</span> Be nothing solicitous; but in every thing,
by prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving, let your petitions be
made known to God.

<span id="an_4:7">4:7</span> And the peace of God, which surpasseth all
understanding, keep your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus.

<span id="an_4:8">4:8</span> For the rest, brethren, whatsoever things
are true, whatsoever modest, whatsoever just, whatsoever holy,
whatsoever lovely, whatsoever of good fame, if there be any virtue, if
any praise of discipline, think on these things.

<span id="an_4:9">4:9</span> The things which you have both learned, and
received, and heard, and seen in me, these do ye, and the God of peace
shall be with you.

<span id="an_4:10">4:10</span> Now I rejoice in the Lord exceedingly,
that now at length your thought for me hath flourished again, as you did
also think; but you were busied.

<span id="an_4:11">4:11</span> I speak not as it were for want. For I
have learned, in whatsoever state I am, to be content therewith.

<span id="an_4:12">4:12</span> I know both how to be brought low, and I
know how to abound: (everywhere, and in all things I am instructed) both
to be full, and to be hungry; both to abound, and to suffer need.

<span id="an_4:13">4:13</span> I can do all these things in him who
strengtheneth me.

<span id="an_4:14">4:14</span> Nevertheless you have done well in
communicating to my tribulation.

<span id="an_4:15">4:15</span> And you also know, O Philippians, that in
the beginning of the gospel, when I departed from Macedonia, no church
communicated with me as concerning giving and receiving, but you only:

<span id="an_4:16">4:16</span> For unto Thessalonica also you sent once
and again for my use.

<span id="an_4:17">4:17</span> Not that I seek the gift, but I seek the
fruit that may abound to your account.

<span id="an_4:18">4:18</span> But I have all, and abound: I am filled,
having received from Epaphroditus the things you sent, an odour of
sweetness, an acceptable sacrifice, pleasing to God.

<span id="an_4:19">4:19</span> And may my God supply all your want,
according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus.

<span id="an_4:20">4:20</span> Now to God and our Father be glory world
without end. Amen.

<span id="an_4:21">4:21</span> Salute ye every saint in Christ Jesus.

<span id="an_4:22">4:22</span> The brethren who are with me, salute you.
All the saints salute you; especially they that are of Caesar's
household.

<span id="an_4:23">4:23</span> The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be
with your spirit. Amen.
