### Douay-Rheims Bible: Philemon

<span id="an_1:1">1:1</span> Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and
Timothy, a brother: to Philemon, our beloved and fellow labourer;

<span id="an_1:2">1:2</span> And to Appia, our dearest sister, and to
Archippus, our fellow soldier, and to the church which is in thy house:

<span id="an_1:3">1:3</span> Grace to you and peace from God our Father,
and from the Lord Jesus Christ.

<span id="an_1:4">1:4</span> I give thanks to my God, always making a
remembrance of thee in my prayers.

<span id="an_1:5">1:5</span> Hearing of thy charity and faith, which
thou hast in the Lord Jesus, and towards all the saints:

<span id="an_1:6">1:6</span> That the communication of thy faith may be
made evident in the acknowledgment of every good work, that is in you in
Christ Jesus.

<span id="an_1:7">1:7</span> For I have had great joy and consolation in
thy charity, because the bowels of the saints have been refreshed by
thee, brother.

<span id="an_1:8">1:8</span> Wherefore though I have much confidence in
Christ Jesus, to command thee that which is to the purpose:

<span id="an_1:9">1:9</span> For charity sake I rather beseech, whereas
thou art such a one, as Paul an old man, and now a prisoner also of
Jesus Christ.

<span id="an_1:10">1:10</span> I beseech thee for my son, whom I have
begotten in my bands, Onesimus,

<span id="an_1:11">1:11</span> Who hath been heretofore unprofitable to
thee, but now is profitable both to me and thee,

<span id="an_1:12">1:12</span> Whom I have sent back to thee. And do
thou receive him as my own bowels.

<span id="an_1:13">1:13</span> Whom I would have retained with me, that
in thy stead he might have ministered to me in the bands of the gospel:

<span id="an_1:14">1:14</span> But without thy counsel I would do
nothing: that thy good deed might not be as it were of necessity, but
voluntary.

<span id="an_1:15">1:15</span> For perhaps he therefore departed for a
season from thee, that thou mightest receive him again for ever:

<span id="an_1:16">1:16</span> Not now as a servant, but instead of a
servant, a most dear brother, especially to me: but how much more to
thee both in the flesh and in the Lord?

<span id="an_1:17">1:17</span> If therefore thou count me a partner,
receive him as myself.

<span id="an_1:18">1:18</span> And if he hath wronged thee in any thing,
or is in thy debt, put that to my account.

<span id="an_1:19">1:19</span> I Paul have written it with my own hand:
I will repay it: not to say to thee, that thou owest me thy own self
also.

<span id="an_1:20">1:20</span> Yea, brother. May I enjoy thee in the
Lord. Refresh my bowels in the Lord.

<span id="an_1:21">1:21</span> Trusting in thy obedience, I have written
to thee: knowing that thou wilt also do more than I say.

<span id="an_1:22">1:22</span> But withal prepare me also a lodging. For
I hope that through your prayers I shall be given unto you.

<span id="an_1:23">1:23</span> There salute thee Epaphras, my fellow
prisoner in Christ Jesus;

<span id="an_1:24">1:24</span> Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke my
fellow labourers.

<span id="an_1:25">1:25</span> The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be
with your spirit. Amen.
