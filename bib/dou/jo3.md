### Douay-Rheims Bible: 3 John

<span id="an_1:1">1:1</span> The ancient to the dearly beloved Gaius,
whom I love in truth.

<span id="an_1:2">1:2</span> Dearly beloved, concerning all things I
make it my prayer that thou mayest proceed prosperously, and fare well
as thy soul doth prosperously.

<span id="an_1:3">1:3</span> I was exceedingly glad when the brethren
came and gave testimony to the truth in thee, even as thou walkest in
the truth.

<span id="an_1:4">1:4</span> I have no greater grace than this, to hear
that my children walk in truth.

<span id="an_1:5">1:5</span> Dearly beloved, thou dost faithfully
whatever thou dost for the brethren, and that for strangers,

<span id="an_1:6">1:6</span> Who have given testimony to thy charity in
the sight of the church: whom thou shalt do well to bring forward on
their way in a manner worthy of God.

<span id="an_1:7">1:7</span> Because, for his name they went out, taking
nothing of the Gentiles.

<span id="an_1:8">1:8</span> We therefore ought to receive such, that we
may be fellow helpers of the truth.

<span id="an_1:9">1:9</span> I had written perhaps to the church: but
Diotrephes, who loveth to have the pre-eminence among them, doth not
receive us.

<span id="an_1:10">1:10</span> For this cause, if I come, I will
advertise his works which he doth, with malicious words prating against
us. And as if these things were not enough for him, neither doth he
himself receive the brethren, and them that do receive them he
forbiddeth, and casteth out of the church.

<span id="an_1:11">1:11</span> Dearly beloved, follow not that which is
evil, but that which is good. He that doth good, is of God: he that doth
evil, hath not seen God.

<span id="an_1:12">1:12</span> To Demetrius testimony is given by all,
and by the truth itself, yea and we also give testimony: and thou
knowest that our testimony is true.

<span id="an_1:13">1:13</span> I had many things to write unto thee: but
I would not by ink and pen write to thee.

<span id="an_1:14">1:14</span> But I hope speedily to see thee, and we
will speak mouth to mouth. Peace be to thee. Our friends salute thee.
Salute the friends by name.
