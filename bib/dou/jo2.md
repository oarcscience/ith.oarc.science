### Douay-Rheims Bible: 2 John

<span id="an_1:1">1:1</span> The ancient to the lady Elect, and her
children, whom I love in the truth, and not I only, but also all they
that have known the truth,

<span id="an_1:2">1:2</span> For the sake of the truth which dwelleth in
us, and shall be with us for ever.

<span id="an_1:3">1:3</span> Grace be with you, mercy, and peace from
God the Father, and from Christ Jesus the Son of the Father; in truth
and charity.

<span id="an_1:4">1:4</span> I was exceeding glad, that I found of thy
children walking in truth, as we have received a commandment from the
Father.

<span id="an_1:5">1:5</span> And now I beseech thee, lady, not as
writing a new commandment to thee, but that which we have had from the
beginning, that we love one another.

<span id="an_1:6">1:6</span> And this is charity, that we walk according
to his commandments. For this is the commandment, that, as you have
heard from the beginning, you should walk in the same:

<span id="an_1:7">1:7</span> For many seducers are gone out into the
world, who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh: this is a
seducer and an antichrist.

<span id="an_1:8">1:8</span> Look to yourselves, that you lose not the
things which you have wrought: but that you may receive a full reward.

<span id="an_1:9">1:9</span> Whosoever revolteth, and continueth not in
the doctrine of Christ, hath not God. He that continueth in the
doctrine, the same hath both the Father and the Son.

<span id="an_1:10">1:10</span> If any man come to you, and bring not
this doctrine, receive him not into the house nor say to him, God speed
you.

<span id="an_1:11">1:11</span> For he that saith unto him, God speed
you, communicateth with his wicked works.

<span id="an_1:12">1:12</span> Having more things to write unto you, I
would not by paper and ink: for I hope that I shall be with you, and
speak face to face: that your joy may be full.

<span id="an_1:13">1:13</span> The children of thy sister Elect salute
thee.
