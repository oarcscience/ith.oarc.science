<p><A NAME="an_1:1">1:1</A>&nbsp;The parables of Solomon, the son of David, king of Israel. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:2">1:2</A>&nbsp;To know wisdom, and instruction: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:3">1:3</A>&nbsp;To understand the words of prudence: and to receive the instruction of doctrine, justice, and judgment, and equity: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:4">1:4</A>&nbsp;To give subtilty to little ones, to the young man knowledge and understanding. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:5">1:5</A>&nbsp;A wise man shall hear and shall be wiser: and he that understandeth, shall possess governments. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:6">1:6</A>&nbsp;He shall understand a parable, and the interpretation, the words of the wise, and their mysterious sayings. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:7">1:7</A>&nbsp;The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom. Fools despise wisdom and instruction. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:8">1:8</A>&nbsp;My son, hear the instruction of thy father, and forsake not the law of thy mother : </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:9">1:9</A>&nbsp;That grace may be added to thy head, and a chain of gold to thy neck. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:10">1:10</A>&nbsp;My son, if sinners shall entice thee, consent not to them. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:11">1:11</A>&nbsp;If they shall say: Come with us, let us lie in wait for blood, let us hide snares for the innocent without cause: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:12">1:12</A>&nbsp;Let us swallow him up alive like hell, and whole as one that goeth down into the pit. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:13">1:13</A>&nbsp;We shall find all precious substance, we shall fill our houses with spoils. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:14">1:14</A>&nbsp;Cast in thy lot with us, let us all have one purse. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:15">1:15</A>&nbsp;My son, walk not thou with them, restrain thy foot from their paths. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:16">1:16</A>&nbsp;For their feet run to evil, and make haste to shed blood. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:17">1:17</A>&nbsp;But a net is spread in vain before the eyes of them that have wings. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:18">1:18</A>&nbsp;And they themselves lie in wait for their own blood, and practise deceits against their own souls. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:19">1:19</A>&nbsp;So the wage of every covetous man destroy the souls of the possessors. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:20">1:20</A>&nbsp;Wisdom preacheth abroad, she uttereth her voice in the streets: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:21">1:21</A>&nbsp;At the head of multitudes she crieth out, in the entrance of the gates of the city she uttereth her words, saying: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:22">1:22</A>&nbsp;O children, how long will you love childishness, and fools covet those things which are hurtful to themselves, and the unwise hate knowledge? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:23">1:23</A>&nbsp;Turn ye at my reproof: behold I will utter my spirit to you, and will shew you my words. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:24">1:24</A>&nbsp;Because I called, and you refused: I stretched out my hand, and there was none that regarded. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:25">1:25</A>&nbsp;You have despised all my counsel, and have neglected my reprehensions. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:26">1:26</A>&nbsp;I also will laugh in your destruction, and will mock when that shall come to you which you feared. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:27">1:27</A>&nbsp;When sudden calamity shall fall on you, and destruction, as a tempest, shall be at hand: when tribulation and distress shall come upon you: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:28">1:28</A>&nbsp;Then shall they call upon me, and I will not hear: they shall rise in the morning and shall not find me: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:29">1:29</A>&nbsp;Because they have hated instruction and received not the fear of the Lord, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:30">1:30</A>&nbsp;Nor consented to my counsel, but despised all my reproof. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:31">1:31</A>&nbsp;Therefore they shall eat the fruit of their own way, and shall be filled with their own devices. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:32">1:32</A>&nbsp;The turning away of little ones shall kill them, and the prosperity of fools shall destroy them. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:33">1:33</A>&nbsp;But he that shall hear me, shall rest without terror, and shall enjoy abundance, without fear of evils. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:1">2:1</A>&nbsp;My son, if thou wilt receive my words, and wilt hide my commandments with thee, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:2">2:2</A>&nbsp;That thy ear may hearken to wisdom: Incline thy heart to know prudence: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:3">2:3</A>&nbsp;For if thou shalt call for wisdom, and incline thy heart to prudence: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:4">2:4</A>&nbsp;If thou shalt seek her as money, and shalt dig for her as for a treasure: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:5">2:5</A>&nbsp;Then shalt thou understand the fear of the Lord, and shalt find the knowledge of God. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:6">2:6</A>&nbsp;Because the Lord giveth wisdom: and out of his mouth cometh prudence and knowledge. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:7">2:7</A>&nbsp;He will keep the salvation of the righteous, and protect them that walk in simplicity. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:8">2:8</A>&nbsp;Keeping the paths of justice, and guarding the ways of saints. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:9">2:9</A>&nbsp;Then shalt thou understand justice, and judgment, and equity, and every good path. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:10">2:10</A>&nbsp;If wisdom shall enter into thy heart, and knowledge please thy soul: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:11">2:11</A>&nbsp;Counsel shall keep thee, and prudence shall preserve thee, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:12">2:12</A>&nbsp;That thou mayst be delivered from the evil way, and from the man that speaketh perverse things: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:13">2:13</A>&nbsp;Who leave the right way, and walk by dark ways: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:14">2:14</A>&nbsp;Who are glad when they have done evil, and rejoice in most wicked things: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:15">2:15</A>&nbsp;Whose ways are perverse, and their steps infamous. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:16">2:16</A>&nbsp;That thou mayst be delivered from the strange women, and from the stranger, who softeneth her words: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:17">2:17</A>&nbsp;And forsaketh the guide of her youth, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:18">2:18</A>&nbsp;And hath forgotten the covenant of her God: for her house inclineth unto death, and her paths to hell. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:19">2:19</A>&nbsp;None that go in unto her shall return again, neither shall they take hold of the paths of life, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:20">2:20</A>&nbsp;That thou mayst walk in a good way: and mayst keep the paths of the just. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:21">2:21</A>&nbsp;For they that are upright shall dwell in the earth, and the simple shall continue in it. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:22">2:22</A>&nbsp;But the wicked shall be destroyed from the earth: and they that do unjustly shall be taken away from it. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:1">3:1</A>&nbsp;My son, forget not my law, and let thy heart keep my commandments. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:2">3:2</A>&nbsp;For they shall add to thee length of days, and years of life and peace. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:3">3:3</A>&nbsp;Let not mercy and truth leave thee, put them about thy neck, and write them in the tables of thy heart: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:4">3:4</A>&nbsp;And thou shalt And grace and good understanding before God and men. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:5">3:5</A>&nbsp;Have confidence in the Lord with all thy heart, and lean not upon thy own prudence. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:6">3:6</A>&nbsp;In all thy ways think on him, and he will direct thy steps. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:7">3:7</A>&nbsp;Be not wise in thy own conceit: fear God, and depart from evil: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:8">3:8</A>&nbsp;For it shall be health to thy navel, and moistening to thy bones. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:9">3:9</A>&nbsp;Honour the Lord with thy substance, and give him of the first of all thy fruits : </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:10">3:10</A>&nbsp;And thy barns shall be filled with abundance, and thy presses shall run over with wine. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:11">3:11</A>&nbsp;My son, reject not the correction of the Lord: and do not faint when thou art chastised by him: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:12">3:12</A>&nbsp;For whom the Lord loveth, he chastiseth: and as a father in the son he pleaseth himself. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:13">3:13</A>&nbsp;Blessed is the man that findeth wisdom and is rich in prudence: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:14">3:14</A>&nbsp;The purchasing thereof is better than the merchandise of silver, and her fruit than the chiefest and purest gold: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:15">3:15</A>&nbsp;She is more precious than all riches : and all the things that are desired, are not to be compared with her. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:16">3:16</A>&nbsp;Length of days is in her right hand, and in her left hand riches and glory. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:17">3:17</A>&nbsp;Her ways are beautiful ways, and all her paths are peaceable. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:18">3:18</A>&nbsp;She is a tree of life to them that lay hold on her: and he that shall retain her is blessed. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:19">3:19</A>&nbsp;The Lord by wisdom hath founded the earth, hath established the heavens by prudence. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:20">3:20</A>&nbsp;By his wisdom the depths have broken out, and the clouds grow thick with dew </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:21">3:21</A>&nbsp;My son, let not these things depart from thy eyes: keep the law and counsel: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:22">3:22</A>&nbsp;And there shall be life to thy soul, and grace to thy mouth. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:23">3:23</A>&nbsp;Then shalt thou walk confidently in thy way, and thy foot shall not stumble: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:24">3:24</A>&nbsp;If thou sleep, thou shalt not fear: thou shalt rest, and thy sleep shall be sweet. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:25">3:25</A>&nbsp;Be not afraid of sudden fear, nor of the power of the wicked falling upon thee. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:26">3:26</A>&nbsp;For the Lord will be at thy side, and will keep thy foot that thou be not taken. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:27">3:27</A>&nbsp;Do not withhold him from doing good, who is able: if thou art able, do good thyself also. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:28">3:28</A>&nbsp;Say not to thy friend: Go, and come again: and to morrow I will give to thee: when thou canst give at present. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:29">3:29</A>&nbsp;Practise not evil against thy friend, when he hath confidence in thee. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:30">3:30</A>&nbsp;Strive not against a man without cause, when he hath done thee no evil. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:31">3:31</A>&nbsp;Envy not the unjust man, and do not follow his ways: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:32">3:32</A>&nbsp;For every mocker is an abomination to the Lord, and his communication is with the simple. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:33">3:33</A>&nbsp;Want is from the Lord in the house of the wicked: but the habitations of the just shall be blessed. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:34">3:34</A>&nbsp;He shall scorn the scorners, and to the meek he will give grace. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:35">3:35</A>&nbsp;The wise shall possess glory: the promotion of fools is disgrace. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:1">4:1</A>&nbsp;Hear, ye children, the instruction of a father, and attend that you may know prudence. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:2">4:2</A>&nbsp;I will give you a good gift, forsake not my law. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:3">4:3</A>&nbsp;For I also was my father's son, tender and as an only son in the sight of my mother: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:4">4:4</A>&nbsp;And he taught me, and said: Let thy heart receive my words, keep my commandments, and thou shalt live. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:5">4:5</A>&nbsp;Get wisdom, get prudence: forget not, neither decline from the words of my mouth. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:6">4:6</A>&nbsp;Forsake her not, and she shall keep thee: love her, and she shall preserve thee. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:7">4:7</A>&nbsp;The beginning of wisdom, get wisdom, and with all thy possession purchase prudence. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:8">4:8</A>&nbsp;Take hold on her, and she shall exalt thee: thou shalt be glorified by her, when thou shalt embrace her. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:9">4:9</A>&nbsp;She shall give to thy head increase of graces, and protect thee with a noble crown. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:10">4:10</A>&nbsp;Hear, O my son, and receive my words, that years of life may be multiplied to thee. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:11">4:11</A>&nbsp;I will shew thee the way of wisdom, I will lead thee by the paths of equity: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:12">4:12</A>&nbsp;Which when thou shalt have entered, thy steps shall not be straitened, and when thou runnest thou shalt not meet a stumblingblock. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:13">4:13</A>&nbsp;Take hold on instruction, leave it not: keep it, because it is thy life. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:14">4:14</A>&nbsp;Be not delighted in the paths of the wicked, neither let the way of evil men please thee. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:15">4:15</A>&nbsp;Flee from it, pass not by it: go aside, and forsake it. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:16">4:16</A>&nbsp;For they sleep not except they have done evil: and their sleep is taken away unless they have made some to fall. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:17">4:17</A>&nbsp;They eat the bread of wickedness, and drink the wine of iniquity. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:18">4:18</A>&nbsp;But the path of the just, as a shining light, goeth forwards and increaseth even to perfect day. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:19">4:19</A>&nbsp;The way of the wicked is darksome: they know not where they fall. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:20">4:20</A>&nbsp;My son, hearken to my words, and incline thy ear to my sayings. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:21">4:21</A>&nbsp;Let them not depart from thy eyes, keep them in the midst of thy heart: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:22">4:22</A>&nbsp;For they are life to those that find them, and health to all flesh. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:23">4:23</A>&nbsp;With all watchfulness keep thy heart, because life issueth out from it. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:24">4:24</A>&nbsp;Remove from thee a froward mouth, and let detracting lips be far from thee. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:25">4:25</A>&nbsp;Let thy eyes look straight on, and let thy eyelids go before thy steps. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:26">4:26</A>&nbsp;Make straight the path for thy feet, and all thy ways shall be established. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:27">4:27</A>&nbsp;Decline not to the right hand, nor to the left: turn away thy foot from evil. For the Lord knoweth the ways that are on the right hand: but those are perverse which are on the left hand. But he will make thy courses straight, he will bring forward thy ways in peace. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:1">5:1</A>&nbsp;My son, attend to my wisdom, and incline thy ear to my prudence. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:2">5:2</A>&nbsp;That thou mayst keep thoughts, and thy lips may preserve instruction. Mind not the deceit of a woman. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:3">5:3</A>&nbsp;For the lips of a harlot are like a honeycomb dropping, and her throat is smoother than oil. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:4">5:4</A>&nbsp;But her end is bitter as wormwood, and sharp as a two-edged sword. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:5">5:5</A>&nbsp;Her feet go down into death, and her steps go in as far as hell. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:6">5:6</A>&nbsp;They walk not by the path of life, her steps are wandering, and unaccountable. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:7">5:7</A>&nbsp;Now therefore, my son, hear me, and depart not from the words of my mouth. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:8">5:8</A>&nbsp;Remove thy way far from her, and come not nigh the doors of her house. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:9">5:9</A>&nbsp;Give not thy honour to strangers, and thy years to the cruel. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:10">5:10</A>&nbsp;Lest strangers be filled with thy strength, and thy labours be in another man's house, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:11">5:11</A>&nbsp;And thou mourn it the last, when thou shalt have spent thy flesh and thy body, and say: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:12">5:12</A>&nbsp;Why have I hated instruction, and my heart consented not to reproof, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:13">5:13</A>&nbsp;And have not heard the voice of them that taught me, and have not in- dined my ear to masters? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:14">5:14</A>&nbsp;I have almost been in all evil, in the midst of the church and of the congregation. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:15">5:15</A>&nbsp;Drink water out of thy own cistern, and the streams of thy own well: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:16">5:16</A>&nbsp;Let thy fountains be conveyed abroad, and in the streets divide thy waters. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:17">5:17</A>&nbsp;Keep them to thyself alone, neither let strangers be partakers with thee. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:18">5:18</A>&nbsp;Let thy vein be blessed, and rejoice with the wife of thy youth: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:19">5:19</A>&nbsp;Let her be thy dearest hind, and most agreeable fawn: let her breasts inebriate thee at all times; he thou delighted continually with her love. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:20">5:20</A>&nbsp;Why art thou seduced, my son, by a strange woman, and art cherished in the bosom of another ? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:21">5:21</A>&nbsp;The Lord beholdeth the ways of man, and considereth all his steps. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:22">5:22</A>&nbsp;His own iniquities catch the wicked, and he is fast bound with the ropes of his own sins. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:23">5:23</A>&nbsp;He shall die, because he hath not received instruction, and in the multitude of his folly he shall be deceived. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:1">6:1</A>&nbsp;My son, if thou be surety for thy friend, thou hast engaged fast thy hand to a stranger. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:2">6:2</A>&nbsp;Thou art ensnared with the words of thy mouth, and caught with thy own words. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:3">6:3</A>&nbsp;Do therefore, my son, what I say, and deliver thyself: because thou art fallen into the hand of thy neighbour. Run about, make haste, stir up thy friend: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:4">6:4</A>&nbsp;Give not sleep to thy eyes, neither let thy eyelids slumber. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:5">6:5</A>&nbsp;Deliver thyself as a doe from the hand, and as a bird from the hand of the fowler. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:6">6:6</A>&nbsp;Go to the ant, O sluggard, and consider her ways, and learn wisdom: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:7">6:7</A>&nbsp;Which, although she hath no guide, nor master, nor captain, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:8">6:8</A>&nbsp;Provideth her meat for herself in the summer, and gathereth her food in the harvest. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:9">6:9</A>&nbsp;How long wilt thou sleep, O sluggard? when wilt thou rise out of thy sleep? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:10">6:10</A>&nbsp;Thou wilt sleep a little, thou wilt slumber a little, thou wilt fold thy hands a little to sleep: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:11">6:11</A>&nbsp;And want shall come upon thee, as a traveller, and poverty as a man armed. But if thou be diligent, thy harvest shall come as a fountain, and want shall flee far from thee. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:12">6:12</A>&nbsp;A man that is an apostate, an unprofitable man, walketh with a perverse mouth, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:13">6:13</A>&nbsp;He winketh with the eyes, presseth with the foot, speaketh with the finger. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:14">6:14</A>&nbsp;With a wicked heart he deviseth evil, and at all times he soweth discord. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:15">6:15</A>&nbsp;To such a one his destruction shall presently come, and he shall suddenly be destroyed, and shall no longer have any remedy. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:16">6:16</A>&nbsp;Six things there are, which the Lord hateth, and the seventh his soul detesteth: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:17">6:17</A>&nbsp;Haughty eyes, a lying tongue, hands that shed innocent blood, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:18">6:18</A>&nbsp;A heart that deviseth wicked plots, feet that are swift to run into mischief, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:19">6:19</A>&nbsp;A deceitful witness that uttereth lies, and him that soweth discord among brethren. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:20">6:20</A>&nbsp;My son, beep the commandments of thy father, and forsake not the law of thy mother. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:21">6:21</A>&nbsp;Bind them in thy heart continually, and put them about thy neck. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:22">6:22</A>&nbsp;When thou walkest, let them go with thee: when thou sleepest, let them keep thee; and when thou awakest, talk with them. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:23">6:23</A>&nbsp;Because the commandment is a lamp, and the law a light, and reproofs of instruction are the way of life: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:24">6:24</A>&nbsp;That they may keep thee from the evil woman, and from the flattering tongue of the stranger. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:25">6:25</A>&nbsp;Let not thy heart covet her beauty, be not caught with her winks: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:26">6:26</A>&nbsp;For the price of a harlot is scarce one loaf: but the woman catcheth the precious soul of a man. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:27">6:27</A>&nbsp;Can a man hide fire in his bosom, and his garments not burn? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:28">6:28</A>&nbsp;Or can he walk upon hot coals, and his feet not be burnt? </p>

<p><A NAME="an_28:17">28:17</A>&nbsp;A man that doth violence to the blood of a person, if he flee even to the pit, no man will stay him. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:18">28:18</A>&nbsp;He that walketh uprightly, shall be saved: he that is perverse in his ways shall fall at once. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:19">28:19</A>&nbsp;He that tilleth his ground, shall be filled with bread: but he that followeth idleness shall be filled with poverty. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:20">28:20</A>&nbsp;A faithful man shall be much praised: but he that maketh haste to be rich, shall not be innocent. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:21">28:21</A>&nbsp;He that hath respect to a person in judgment, doth not well: such a man even for a morsel of bread forsaketh the truth. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:22">28:22</A>&nbsp;A man, that maketh haste to be rich, and envieth others, is ignorant that poverty shall come upon him. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:23">28:23</A>&nbsp;He that rebuketh a man, shall afterward find favour with him, more than he that by a flattering tongue deceiveth him. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:24">28:24</A>&nbsp;He that stealeth any thing from his father, or from his mother: and saith, This is no sin, is the partner of a murderer. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:25">28:25</A>&nbsp;He that boasteth, and puffeth up himself, stirreth up quarrels: but he that trusteth in the Lord, shall be healed. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:26">28:26</A>&nbsp;He that trusteth in his own heart, is a fool: but he that walketh wisely, he shall be saved. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:27">28:27</A>&nbsp;He that giveth to the poor, shall not want: he that despiseth his entreaty, shall suffer indigence. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:28">28:28</A>&nbsp;When the wicked rise up, men shall hide themselves: when they perish, the lust shall be multiplied. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:1">29:1</A>&nbsp;The man that with a stiff neck despiseth him that reproveth him, shall suddenly be destroyed: and health shall not follow him. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:2">29:2</A>&nbsp;When just men increase, the people shall rejoice: when the wicked shall bear rule, the people shall mourn. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:3">29:3</A>&nbsp;A man that loveth wisdom, rejoiceth his father: but he that maintaineth bar lots, shall squander away his substance. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:4">29:4</A>&nbsp;A just king setteth up the land: a covetous man shall destroy it. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:5">29:5</A>&nbsp;A man that speaketh to his friend with flattering and dissembling words, spreadeth a net for his feet. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:6">29:6</A>&nbsp;A snare shall entangle the wicked man when he sinneth: and the just shall praise and rejoice. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:7">29:7</A>&nbsp;The just taketh notice of the cause of the poor: the wicked is void of knowledge. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:8">29:8</A>&nbsp;Corrupt men bring a city to ruin: but wise men turn away wrath. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:9">29:9</A>&nbsp;If a wise man contend with a fool, whether he be angry or laugh, he shall find no rest. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:10">29:10</A>&nbsp;Bloodthirsty men hate the upright: but just men seek his soul. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:11">29:11</A>&nbsp;A fool uttereth all his mind: a wise man deferreth, and keepeth it till afterwards. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:12">29:12</A>&nbsp;A prince that gladly heareth lying words, hath all his servants wicked. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:13">29:13</A>&nbsp;The poor man and the creditor have met one another: the Lord is the enlightener of them both. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:14">29:14</A>&nbsp;The king that judgeth the poor in truth, his throne shall be established for ever. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:15">29:15</A>&nbsp;The rod and reproof give wisdom: but the child that is left to his own will bringeth his mother to shame. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:16">29:16</A>&nbsp;When the wicked are multiplied, crimes shall be multiplied: but the just shall see their downfall. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:17">29:17</A>&nbsp;Instruct thy son, and he shall refresh thee, and shall give delight to thy soul. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:18">29:18</A>&nbsp;When prophecy shall fail, the people shall be scattered abroad: but he that keepeth the law is blessed. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:19">29:19</A>&nbsp;A slave will not be corrected by words: because he understandeth what thou sayest, and will not answer. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:20">29:20</A>&nbsp;Hast thou seen a man hasty to speak? folly is rather to be looked for, than his amendment. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:21">29:21</A>&nbsp;He that nourisheth his servant delicately from his childhood, afterwards shall find him stubborn. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:22">29:22</A>&nbsp;A passionate man provoketh quarrels: and he that is easily stirred up to wrath, shall be more prone to sin. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:23">29:23</A>&nbsp;Humiliation followeth the proud: and glory shall uphold the humble of spirit. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:24">29:24</A>&nbsp;He that is partaker with a thief, hateth his own soul: he heareth one putting him to his oath, and discovereth not. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:25">29:25</A>&nbsp;He that feareth man, shall quickly fall: he that trusteth in the Lord, shall be set on high. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:26">29:26</A>&nbsp;Many seek the face of the prince: but the judgment of every one cometh forth from the Lord. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:27">29:27</A>&nbsp;The just abhor the wicked man: and the wicked loathe them that are in the right way. The son that keepeth the word, shall be free from destruction. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:1">30:1</A>&nbsp;The words of Gatherer the son of Vomiter. The vision which the man spoke with whom God is, and who being strengthened by God, abiding with him, said: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:2">30:2</A>&nbsp;I am the most foolish of men, and the wisdom of men is not with me. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:3">30:3</A>&nbsp;I have not learned wisdom, and have not known the science of saints. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:4">30:4</A>&nbsp;Who hath ascended up into heaven, and descended? who hath held the wind in his hands? who hath bound up the waters together as in a garment? who hath raised up all the borders of the earth? what is his name, and what is the name of his son, if thou knowest? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:5">30:5</A>&nbsp;Every word of God is fire tried: he is a buckler to them that hope in him. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:6">30:6</A>&nbsp;Add not any thing to his words, lest thou be reproved, and found a liar: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:7">30:7</A>&nbsp;Two things I have asked of thee, deny them not to me before I die. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:8">30:8</A>&nbsp;Remove far from me vanity, and lying words. Give me neither beggary, nor riches: give me only the necessaries of life: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:9">30:9</A>&nbsp;Lest perhaps being filled, I should be tempted to deny, and say: Who is the Lord? or being compelled by poverty, I should steal, and forswear the name of my God. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:10">30:10</A>&nbsp;Accuse not a servant to his master, lest he curse thee, and thou fall. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:11">30:11</A>&nbsp;There is a generation that curseth their father, and doth not bless their mother. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:12">30:12</A>&nbsp;A generation that are pure in their own eyes, and yet are not washed from their filthiness. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:13">30:13</A>&nbsp;A generation, whose eyes are lofty, and their eyelids lifted up on high. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:14">30:14</A>&nbsp;A generation, that for teeth hath swords, and grindeth with their jaw teeth, to devour the needy from off the earth, and the poor from among men. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:15">30:15</A>&nbsp;The horseleech hath two daughters that say: Bring, bring. There are three things that never are satisfied, and the fourth never saith: It is enough. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:16">30:16</A>&nbsp;Hell, and the mouth of the womb, and the earth which is not satisfied with water: and the fire never saith: It is enough. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:17">30:17</A>&nbsp;The eye that mocketh at his father, and that despiseth the labour of his mother in bearing him, let the ravens of the brooks pick it out, and the young eagles eat it. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:18">30:18</A>&nbsp;Three things are hard to me, and the fourth I am utterly ignorant of. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:19">30:19</A>&nbsp;The way of an eagle in the air, the way of a serpent upon a rock, the way of a ship in the midst of the sea, and the way of a man in youth. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:20">30:20</A>&nbsp;Such is also the way of an adulterous woman, who eateth, and wipeth her mouth, and saith: I have done no evil. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:21">30:21</A>&nbsp;By three things the earth is disturbed, and the fourth it cannot bear: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:22">30:22</A>&nbsp;By a slave when he reigneth: by a fool when he is filled with meat: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:23">30:23</A>&nbsp;By an odious woman when she is married: and by a bondwoman when she is heir to her mistress. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:24">30:24</A>&nbsp;There are four very little things of the earth, and they are wiser than the wise: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:25">30:25</A>&nbsp;The ants, a feeble people, which provide themselves food in the harvest: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:26">30:26</A>&nbsp;The rabbit, a weak people, which maketh its bed in the rock: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:27">30:27</A>&nbsp;The locust hath no king, yet they all go out by their bands. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:28">30:28</A>&nbsp;The stellio supporteth itself on hands, and dwelleth in kings' houses. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:29">30:29</A>&nbsp;There are three things, which go well, and the fourth that walketh happily: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:30">30:30</A>&nbsp;A lion, the strongest of beasts, who hath no fear of any thing he meeteth: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:31">30:31</A>&nbsp;A cock girded about the loins: and a ram: and a king, whom none can resist. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:32">30:32</A>&nbsp;There is that hath appeared a fool after he was lifted up on high: for if he had understood, he would have laid his hand upon his mouth. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:33">30:33</A>&nbsp;And he that strongly squeezeth the papa to bring out milk, straineth out butter: and he that violently bloweth his nose, bringeth out blood: and he that provoketh wrath bringeth forth strife. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:1">31:1</A>&nbsp;The words of king Lamuel. The vision wherewith his mother instructed him. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:2">31:2</A>&nbsp;What, O my beloved, what, O the beloved of my womb, what, O the beloved of my vows? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:3">31:3</A>&nbsp;Give not thy substance to women, and thy riches to destroy kings. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:4">31:4</A>&nbsp;Give not to kings, O Lamuel, give not wine to kings: because there is no secret where drunkenness reigneth: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:5">31:5</A>&nbsp;And lest they drink and forget judgments, and pervert the cause of the children of the poor. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:6">31:6</A>&nbsp;Give strong drink to them that are sad: and wine to them that are grieved in mind: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:7">31:7</A>&nbsp;Let them drink, and forget their want, and remember their sorrow no more. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:8">31:8</A>&nbsp;Open thy mouth for the dumb, and for the causes of all the children that pass. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:9">31:9</A>&nbsp;Open thy mouth, decree that which is just, and do justice to the needy and poor. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:10">31:10</A>&nbsp;Who shall find a valiant woman? far and from the uttermost coasts is the price of her. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:11">31:11</A>&nbsp;The heart of her husband trusteth in her, and he shall have no need of spoils. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:12">31:12</A>&nbsp;She will render him good, and not evil, all the days of her life. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:13">31:13</A>&nbsp;She hath sought wool and flax, and hath wrought by the counsel of her hands. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:14">31:14</A>&nbsp;She is like the merchant's ship, she bringeth her bread from afar. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:15">31:15</A>&nbsp;And she hath risen in the night, and given a prey to her household, and victuals to her maidens. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:16">31:16</A>&nbsp;She hath considered a field, and bought it: with the fruit of her hands she hath planted a vineyard. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:17">31:17</A>&nbsp;She hath girded her loins with strength, and hath strengthened her arm. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:18">31:18</A>&nbsp;She hath tasted and seen that her traffic is good: her lamp shall not be put out in the night. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:19">31:19</A>&nbsp;She hath put out her hand to strong things, and her fingers have taken hold of the spindle. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:20">31:20</A>&nbsp;She hath opened her hand to the needy, and stretched out her hands to the poor. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:21">31:21</A>&nbsp;She shall not fear for her house in the cold of snow: for dl her domestics are clothed with double garments. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:22">31:22</A>&nbsp;She hath made for herself clothing of tapestry: fine linen, and purple is her covering. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:23">31:23</A>&nbsp;Her husband is honourable in the gates, when he sitteth among the senators of the land. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:24">31:24</A>&nbsp;She made fine linen, and sold it, end delivered a girdle to the Chanaanite. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:25">31:25</A>&nbsp;Strength and beauty are her clothing, and she shall laugh in the latter day. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:26">31:26</A>&nbsp;She hath opened her mouth to wisdom, and the law of clemency is on her tongue. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:27">31:27</A>&nbsp;She hath looked well to the paths of her house, and hath not eaten her bread idle. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:28">31:28</A>&nbsp;Her children rose up, and called her blessed: her husband, and he praised her. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:29">31:29</A>&nbsp;Many daughters have gathered together riches: thou hast surpassed them all. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:30">31:30</A>&nbsp;Favour is deceitful, and beauty is vain: the woman that feareth the Lord, she shall be praised. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:31">31:31</A>&nbsp;Give her of the fruit of her hands: and let her works praise her in the gates.</p>
