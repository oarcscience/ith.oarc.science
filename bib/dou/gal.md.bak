### Douay-Rheims Bible: Galatians

<span id="an_1:1">1:1</span> Paul, an apostle, not of men, neither by
man, but by Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the
dead,

<span id="an_1:2">1:2</span> And all the brethren who are with me, to
the churches of Galatia.

<span id="an_1:3">1:3</span> Grace be to you, and peace from God the
Father, and from our Lord Jesus Christ,

<span id="an_1:4">1:4</span> Who gave himself for our sins, that he
might deliver us from this present wicked world, according to the will
of God and our Father:

<span id="an_1:5">1:5</span> To whom is glory for ever and ever. Amen.

<span id="an_1:6">1:6</span> I wonder that you are so soon removed from
him that called you into the grace of Christ, unto another gospel.

<span id="an_1:7">1:7</span> Which is not another, only there are some
that trouble you, and would pervert the gospel of Christ.

<span id="an_1:8">1:8</span> But though we, or an angel from heaven,
preach a gospel to you besides that which we have preached to you, let
him be anathema.

<span id="an_1:9">1:9</span> As we said before, so now I say again: If
any one preach to you a gospel, besides that which you have received,
let him be anathema.

<span id="an_1:10">1:10</span> For do I now persuade men, or God? Or do
I seek to please men? If I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant
of Christ.

<span id="an_1:11">1:11</span> For I give you to understand, brethren,
that the gospel which was preached by me is not according to man.

<span id="an_1:12">1:12</span> For neither did I receive it of man, nor
did I learn it; but by the revelation of Jesus Christ.

<span id="an_1:13">1:13</span> For you have heard of my conversation in
time past in the Jews' religion: how that, beyond measure, I persecuted
the church of God, and wasted it.

<span id="an_1:14">1:14</span> And I made progress in the Jews' religion
above many of my equals in my own nation, being more abundantly zealous
for the traditions of my fathers.

<span id="an_1:15">1:15</span> But when it pleased him, who separated me
from my mother's womb, and called me by his grace,

<span id="an_1:16">1:16</span> To reveal his Son in me, that I might
preach him among the Gentiles, immediately I condescended not to flesh
and blood.

<span id="an_1:17">1:17</span> Neither went I to Jerusalem, to the
apostles who were before me: but I went into Arabia, and again I
returned to Damascus.

<span id="an_1:18">1:18</span> Then, after three years, I went to
Jerusalem, to see Peter, and I tarried with him fifteen days.

<span id="an_1:19">1:19</span> But other of the apostles I saw none,
saving James the brother of the Lord.

<span id="an_1:20">1:20</span> Now the things which I write to you,
behold, before God, I lie not.

<span id="an_1:21">1:21</span> Afterwards I came into the regions of
Syria and Cilicia.

<span id="an_1:22">1:22</span> And I was unknown by face to the churches
of Judea, which were in Christ:

<span id="an_1:23">1:23</span> But they had heard only: He, who
persecuted us in times past, doth now preach the faith which once he
impugned:

<span id="an_1:24">1:24</span> And they glorified God in me.

<span id="an_2:1">2:1</span> Then, after fourteen years, I went up again
to Jerusalem with Barnabas, taking Titus also with me.

<span id="an_2:2">2:2</span> And I went up according to revelation; and
communicated to them the gospel, which I preach among the Gentiles, but
apart to them who seemed to be some thing: lest perhaps I should run, or
had run in vain.

<span id="an_2:3">2:3</span> But neither Titus, who was with me, being a
Gentile, was compelled to be circumcised.

<span id="an_2:4">2:4</span> But because of false brethren unawares
brought in, who came in privately to spy our liberty, which we have in
Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into servitude.

<span id="an_2:5">2:5</span> To whom we yielded not by subjection, no
not for an hour, that the truth of the gospel might continue with you.

<span id="an_2:6">2:6</span> But of them who seemed to be some thing,
(what they were some time, it is nothing to me, God accepteth not the
person of man,) for to me they that seemed to be some thing added
nothing.

<span id="an_2:7">2:7</span> But contrariwise, when they had seen that
to me was committed the gospel of the uncircumcision, as to Peter was
that of the circumcision.

<span id="an_2:8">2:8</span> (For he who wrought in Peter to the
apostleship of the circumcision, wrought in me also among the Gentiles.)

<span id="an_2:9">2:9</span> And when they had known the grace that was
given to me, James and Cephas and John, who seemed to be pillars, gave
to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship: that we should go unto
the Gentiles, and they unto the circumcision:

<span id="an_2:10">2:10</span> Only that we should be mindful of the
poor: which same thing also I was careful to do.

<span id="an_2:11">2:11</span> But when Cephas was come to Antioch, I
withstood him to the face, because he was to be blamed.

<span id="an_2:12">2:12</span> For before that some came from James, he
did eat with the Gentiles: but when they were come, he withdrew and
separated himself, fearing them who were of the circumcision.

<span id="an_2:13">2:13</span> And to his dissimulation the rest of the
Jews consented, so that Barnabas also was led by them into that
dissimulation.

<span id="an_2:14">2:14</span> But when I saw that they walked not
uprightly unto the truth of the gospel, I said to Cephas before them
all: If thou, being a Jew, livest after the manner of the Gentiles, and
not as the Jews do, how dost thou compel the Gentiles to live as do the
Jews?

<span id="an_2:15">2:15</span> We by nature are Jews, and not of the
Gentiles sinners.

<span id="an_2:16">2:16</span> But knowing that man is not justified by
the works of the law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ; we also believe
in Christ Jesus, that we may be justified by the faith of Christ, and
not by the works of the law: because by the works of the law no flesh
shall be justified.

<span id="an_2:17">2:17</span> But if while we seek to be justified in
Christ, we ourselves also are found sinners; is Christ then the minister
of sin? God forbid.

<span id="an_2:18">2:18</span> For if I build up again the things which
I have destroyed, I make myself a prevaricator.

<span id="an_2:19">2:19</span> For I, through the law, am dead to the
law, that I may live to God: with Christ I am nailed to the cross.

<span id="an_2:20">2:20</span> And I live, now not I; but Christ liveth
in me. And that I live now in the flesh: I live in the faith of the Son
of God, who loved me, and delivered himself for me.

<span id="an_2:21">2:21</span> I cast not away the grace of God. For if
justice be by the law, then Christ died in vain.

<span id="an_3:1">3:1</span> O senseless Galatians, who hath bewitched
you that you should not obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ
hath been set forth, crucified among you?

<span id="an_3:2">3:2</span> This only would I learn of you: Did you
receive the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?

<span id="an_3:3">3:3</span> Are you so foolish, that, whereas you began
in the Spirit, you would now be made perfect by the flesh?

<span id="an_3:4">3:4</span> Have you suffered so great things in vain?
If it be yet in vain.

<span id="an_3:5">3:5</span> He therefore who giveth to you the Spirit,
and worketh miracles among you; doth he do it by the works of the law,
or by the hearing of the faith?

<span id="an_3:6">3:6</span> As it is written: Abraham believed God, and
it was reputed to him unto justice.

<span id="an_3:7">3:7</span> Know ye therefore, that they who are of
faith, the same are the children of Abraham.

<span id="an_3:8">3:8</span> And the scripture, foreseeing, that God
justifieth the Gentiles by faith, told unto Abraham before: In thee
shall all nations be blessed.

<span id="an_3:9">3:9</span> Therefore they that are of faith, shall be
blessed with faithful Abraham.

<span id="an_3:10">3:10</span> For as many as are of the works of the
law, are under a curse. For it is written: Cursed is every one, that
abideth not in all things, which are written in the book of the law to
do them.

<span id="an_3:11">3:11</span> But that in the law no man is justified
with God, it is manifest: because the just man liveth by faith.

<span id="an_3:12">3:12</span> But the law is not of faith: but, He that
doth those things, shall live in them.

<span id="an_3:13">3:13</span> Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of
the law, being made a curse for us: for it is written: Cursed is every
one that hangeth on a tree:

<span id="an_3:14">3:14</span> That the blessing of Abraham might come
on the Gentiles through Christ Jesus: that we may receive the promise of
the Spirit by faith.

<span id="an_3:15">3:15</span> Brethren (I speak after the manner of
man,) yet a man's testament, if it be confirmed, no man despiseth, nor
addeth to it.

<span id="an_3:16">3:16</span> To Abraham were the promises made and to
his seed. He saith not, And to his seeds, as of many: but as of one, And
to thy seed, which is Christ.

<span id="an_3:17">3:17</span> Now this I say, that the testament which
was confirmed by God, the law which was made after four hundred and
thirty years, doth not disannul, to make the promise of no effect.

<span id="an_3:18">3:18</span> For if the inheritance be of the law, it
is no more of promise. But God gave it to Abraham by promise.

<span id="an_3:19">3:19</span> Why then was the law? It was set because
of transgressions, until the seed should come, to whom he made the
promise, being ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator.

<span id="an_3:20">3:20</span> Now a mediator is not of one: but God is
one.

<span id="an_3:21">3:21</span> Was the law then against the promises of
God? God forbid. For if there had been a law given which could give
life, verily justice should have been by the law.

<span id="an_3:22">3:22</span> But the scripture hath concluded all
under sin, that the promise, by the faith of Jesus Christ, might be
given to them that believe.

<span id="an_3:23">3:23</span> But before the faith came, we were kept
under the law shut up, unto that faith which was to be revealed.

<span id="an_3:24">3:24</span> Wherefore the law was our pedagogue in
Christ, that we might be justified by faith.

<span id="an_3:25">3:25</span> But after the faith is come, we are no
longer under a pedagogue.

<span id="an_3:26">3:26</span> For you are all the children of God by
faith, in Christ Jesus.

<span id="an_3:27">3:27</span> For as many of you as have been baptized
in Christ, have put on Christ.

<span id="an_3:28">3:28</span> There is neither Jew nor Greek: there is
neither bond nor free: there is neither male nor female. For you are all
one in Christ Jesus.

<span id="an_3:29">3:29</span> And if you be Christ's, then are you the
seed of Abraham, heirs according to the promise.

<span id="an_4:1">4:1</span> Now I say, as long as the heir is a child,
he differeth nothing from a servant, though he be lord of all;

<span id="an_4:2">4:2</span> But is under tutors and governors until the
time appointed by the father:

<span id="an_4:3">4:3</span> So we also, when we were children, were
serving under the elements of the world.

<span id="an_4:4">4:4</span> But when the fulness of the time was come,
God sent his Son, made of a woman, made under the law:

<span id="an_4:5">4:5</span> That he might redeem them who were under
the law: that we might receive the adoption of sons.

<span id="an_4:6">4:6</span> And because you are sons, God hath sent the
Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying: Abba, Father.

<span id="an_4:7">4:7</span> Therefore now he is not a servant, but a
son. And if a son, an heir also through God.

<span id="an_4:8">4:8</span> But then indeed, not knowing God, you
served them, who, by nature, are not gods.

<span id="an_4:9">4:9</span> But now, after that you have known God, or
rather are known by God: how turn you again to the weak and needy
elements, which you desire to serve again?

<span id="an_4:10">4:10</span> You observe days, and months, and times,
and years.

<span id="an_4:11">4:11</span> I am afraid of you, lest perhaps I have
laboured in vain among you.

<span id="an_4:12">4:12</span> Be ye as I, because I also am as you:
brethren, I beseech you: you have not injured me at all.

<span id="an_4:13">4:13</span> And you know, how through infirmity of
the flesh, I preached the gospel to you heretofore: and your temptation
in my flesh,

<span id="an_4:14">4:14</span> You despised not, nor rejected: but
received me as an angel of God, even as Christ Jesus.

<span id="an_4:15">4:15</span> Where is then your blessedness? For I
bear you witness, that, if it could be done, you would have plucked out
your own eyes, and would have given them to me.

<span id="an_4:16">4:16</span> Am I then become your enemy, because I
tell you the truth?

<span id="an_4:17">4:17</span> They are zealous in your regard not well:
but they would exclude you, that you might be zealous for them.

<span id="an_4:18">4:18</span> But be zealous for that which is good in
a good thing always: and not only when I am present with you.

<span id="an_4:19">4:19</span> My little children, of whom I am in
labour again, until Christ be formed in you.

<span id="an_4:20">4:20</span> And I would willingly be present with you
now, and change my voice: because I am ashamed for you.

<span id="an_4:21">4:21</span> Tell me, you that desire to be under the
law, have you not read the law?

<span id="an_4:22">4:22</span> For it is written that Abraham had two
sons: the one by a bondwoman, and the other by a free woman.

<span id="an_4:23">4:23</span> But he who was of the bondwoman, was born
according to the flesh: but he of the free woman, was by promise.

<span id="an_4:24">4:24</span> Which things are said by an allegory. For
these are the two testaments. The one from mount Sina, engendering unto
bondage; which is Agar:

<span id="an_4:25">4:25</span> For Sina is a mountain in Arabia, which
hath affinity to that Jerusalem which now is, and is in bondage with her
children.

<span id="an_4:26">4:26</span> But that Jerusalem, which is above, is
free: which is our mother.

<span id="an_4:27">4:27</span> For it is written: Rejoice, thou barren,
that bearest not: break forth and cry, thou that travailest not: for
many are the children of the desolate, more than of her that hath a
husband.

<span id="an_4:28">4:28</span> Now we, brethren, as Isaac was, are the
children of promise.

<span id="an_4:29">4:29</span> But as then he, that was born according
to the flesh, persecuted him that was after the spirit; so also it is
now.

<span id="an_4:30">4:30</span> But what saith the scripture? Cast out
the bondwoman and her son; for the son of the bondwoman shall not be
heir with the son of the free woman.

<span id="an_4:31">4:31</span> So then, brethren, we are not the
children of the bondwoman, but of the free: by the freedom wherewith
Christ has made us free.

<span id="an_5:1">5:1</span> Stand fast, and be not held again under the
yoke of bondage.

<span id="an_5:2">5:2</span> Behold, I Paul tell you, that if you be
circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing.

<span id="an_5:3">5:3</span> And I testify again to every man
circumcising himself, that he is a debtor to the whole law.

<span id="an_5:4">5:4</span> You are made void of Christ, you who are
justified in the law: you are fallen from grace.

<span id="an_5:5">5:5</span> For we in spirit, by faith, wait for the
hope of justice.

<span id="an_5:6">5:6</span> For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision
availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision: but faith that worketh by
charity.

<span id="an_5:7">5:7</span> You did run well, who hath hindered you,
that you should not obey the truth?

<span id="an_5:8">5:8</span> This persuasion is not from him that
calleth you.

<span id="an_5:9">5:9</span> A little leaven corrupteth the whole lump.

<span id="an_5:10">5:10</span> I have confidence in you in the Lord:
that you will not be of another mind: but he that troubleth you, shall
bear the judgment, whosoever he be.

<span id="an_5:11">5:11</span> And I, brethren, if I yet preach
circumcision, why do I yet suffer persecution? Then is the scandal of
the cross made void.

<span id="an_5:12">5:12</span> I would they were even cut off, who
trouble you.

<span id="an_5:13">5:13</span> For you, brethren, have been called unto
liberty: only make not liberty an occasion to the flesh, but by charity
of the spirit serve one another.

<span id="an_5:14">5:14</span> For all the law is fulfilled in one word:
Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.

<span id="an_5:15">5:15</span> But if you bite and devour one another;
take heed you be not consumed one of another.

<span id="an_5:16">5:16</span> I say then, walk in the spirit, and you
shall not fulfil the lusts of the flesh.

<span id="an_5:17">5:17</span> For the flesh lusteth against the spirit:
and the spirit against the flesh; for these are contrary one to another:
so that you do not the things that you would.

<span id="an_5:18">5:18</span> But if you are led by the spirit, you are
not under the law.

<span id="an_5:19">5:19</span> Now the works of the flesh are manifest,
which are fornication, uncleanness, immodesty, luxury,

<span id="an_5:20">5:20</span> Idolatry, witchcrafts, enmities,
contentions, emulations, wraths, quarrels, dissensions, sects,

<span id="an_5:21">5:21</span> Envies, murders, drunkenness, revellings,
and such like. Of the which I foretell you, as I have foretold to you,
that they who do such things shall not obtain the kingdom of God.

<span id="an_5:22">5:22</span> But the fruit of the Spirit is, charity,
joy, peace, patience, benignity, goodness, longanimity,

<span id="an_5:23">5:23</span> Mildness, faith, modesty, continency,
chastity. Against such there is no law.

<span id="an_5:24">5:24</span> And they that are Christ's, have
crucified their flesh, with the vices and concupiscences.

<span id="an_5:25">5:25</span> If we live in the Spirit, let us also
walk in the Spirit.

<span id="an_5:26">5:26</span> Let us not be made desirous of vain
glory, provoking one another, envying on another.

<span id="an_6:1">6:1</span> Brethren, and if a man be overtaken in any
fault, you, who are spiritual, instruct such a one in the spirit of
meekness, considering thyself, lest thou also be tempted.

<span id="an_6:2">6:2</span> Bear ye one another's burdens; and so you
shall fulfil the law of Christ.

<span id="an_6:3">6:3</span> For if any man think himself to be some
thing, whereas he is nothing, he deceiveth himself.

<span id="an_6:4">6:4</span> But let every one prove his own work, and
so he shall have glory in himself only, and not in another.

<span id="an_6:5">6:5</span> For every one shall bear his own burden.

<span id="an_6:6">6:6</span> And let him that is instructed in the word,
communicate to him that instructeth him, in all good things.

<span id="an_6:7">6:7</span> Be not deceived, God is not mocked.

<span id="an_6:8">6:8</span> For what things a man shall sow, those also
shall he reap. For he that soweth in his flesh, of the flesh also shall
reap corruption. But he that soweth in the spirit, of the spirit shall
reap life everlasting.

<span id="an_6:9">6:9</span> And in doing good, let us not fail. For in
due time we shall reap, not failing.

<span id="an_6:10">6:10</span> Therefore, whilst we have time, let us
work good to all men, but especially to those who are of the household
of the faith.

<span id="an_6:11">6:11</span> See what a letter I have written to you
with my own hand.

<span id="an_6:12">6:12</span> For as many as desire to please in the
flesh, they constrain you to be circumcised, only that they may not
suffer the persecution of the cross of Christ.

<span id="an_6:13">6:13</span> For neither they themselves who are
circumcised, keep the law; but they will have you to be circumcised,
that they may glory in your flesh.

<span id="an_6:14">6:14</span> But God forbid that I should glory, save
in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ; by whom the world is crucified to
me, and I to the world.

<span id="an_6:15">6:15</span> For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision
availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision, but a new creature.

<span id="an_6:16">6:16</span> And whosoever shall follow this rule,
peace on them, and mercy, and upon the Israel of God.

<span id="an_6:17">6:17</span> From henceforth let no man be troublesome
to me; for I bear the marks of the Lord Jesus in my body.

<span id="an_6:18">6:18</span> The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be
with your spirit, brethren. Amen.
