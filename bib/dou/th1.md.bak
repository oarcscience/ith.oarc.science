### Douay-Rheims Bible: 1 Thessalonians

<span id="an_1:1">1:1</span> Paul and Sylvanus and Timothy: to the
church of the Thessalonians, in God the Father, and in the Lord Jesus
Christ.

<span id="an_1:2">1:2</span> Grace be to you and peace. We give thanks
to God always for you all; making a remembrance of you in our prayers
without ceasing,

<span id="an_1:3">1:3</span> Being mindful of the work of your faith,
and labour, and charity, and of the enduring of the hope of our Lord
Jesus Christ before God and our Father:

<span id="an_1:4">1:4</span> Knowing, brethren beloved of God, your
election:

<span id="an_1:5">1:5</span> For our gospel hath not been unto you in
word only, but in power also, and in the Holy Ghost, and in much
fulness, as you know what manner of men we have been among you for your
sakes.

<span id="an_1:6">1:6</span> And you became followers of us, and of the
Lord; receiving the word in much tribulation, with joy of the Holy
Ghost:

<span id="an_1:7">1:7</span> So that you were made a pattern to all that
believe in Macedonia and in Achaia.

<span id="an_1:8">1:8</span> For from you was spread abroad the word of
the Lord, not only in Macedonia, and in Achaia, but also in every place,
your faith which is towards God, is gone forth, so that we need not to
speak any thing.

<span id="an_1:9">1:9</span> For they themselves relate of us, what
manner of entering in we had unto you; and how you turned to God from
idols, to serve the living and true God.

<span id="an_1:10">1:10</span> And to wait for his Son from heaven (whom
he raised up from the dead,) Jesus, who hath delivered us from the wrath
to come.

<span id="an_2:1">2:1</span> For yourselves know, brethren, our entrance
in unto you, that it was not in vain:

<span id="an_2:2">2:2</span> But having suffered many things before, and
been shamefully treated (as you know) at Philippi, we had confidence in
our God, to speak unto you the gospel of God in much carefulness.

<span id="an_2:3">2:3</span> For our exhortation was not of error, nor
of uncleanness, nor in deceit:

<span id="an_2:4">2:4</span> But as we were approved by God that the
gospel should be committed to us: even so we speak, not as pleasing men,
but God, who proveth our hearts.

<span id="an_2:5">2:5</span> For neither have we used, at any time, the
speech of flattery, as you know; nor taken an occasion of covetousness,
God is witness:

<span id="an_2:6">2:6</span> Nor sought we glory of men, neither of you,
nor of others.

<span id="an_2:7">2:7</span> Whereas we might have been burdensome to
you, as the apostles of Christ: but we became little ones in the midst
of you, as if a nurse should cherish her children:

<span id="an_2:8">2:8</span> So desirous of you, we would gladly impart
unto you not only the gospel of God, but also our own souls: because you
were become most dear unto us.

<span id="an_2:9">2:9</span> For you remember, brethren, our labour and
toil: working night and day, lest we should be chargeable to any of you,
we preached among you the gospel of God.

<span id="an_2:10">2:10</span> You are witnesses, and God also, how
holily, and justly, and without blame, we have been to you that have
believed:

<span id="an_2:11">2:11</span> As you know in what manner, entreating
and comforting you, (as a father doth his children,)

<span id="an_2:12">2:12</span> We testified to every one of you, that
you would walk worthy of God, who hath called you unto his kingdom and
glory.

<span id="an_2:13">2:13</span> Therefore, we also give thanks to God
without ceasing: because, that when you had received of us the word of
the hearing of God, you received it not as the word of men, but (as it
is indeed) the word of God, who worketh in you that have believed.

<span id="an_2:14">2:14</span> For you, brethren, are become followers
of the churches of God which are in Judea, in Christ Jesus: for you also
have suffered the same things from your own coutrymen, even as they have
from the Jews,

<span id="an_2:15">2:15</span> Who both killed the Lord Jesus, and the
prophets, and have persecuted us, and please not God, and are
adversaries to all men;

<span id="an_2:16">2:16</span> Prohibiting us to speak to the Gentiles,
that they may be saved, to fill up their sins always: for the wrath of
God is come upon them to the end.

<span id="an_2:17">2:17</span> But we, brethren, being taken away from
you for a short time, in sight, not in heart, have hastened the more
abundantly to see your face with great desire.

<span id="an_2:18">2:18</span> For we would have come unto you, I Paul
indeed, once and again: but Satan hath hindered us.

<span id="an_2:19">2:19</span> For what is our hope, or joy, or crown of
glory? Are not you, in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at his
coming?

<span id="an_2:20">2:20</span> For you are our glory and joy.

<span id="an_3:1">3:1</span> For which cause, forbearing no longer, we
thought it good to remain at Athens alone:

<span id="an_3:2">3:2</span> And we sent Timothy, our brother, and the
minister of God in the gospel of Christ, to confirm you and exhort you
concerning your faith:

<span id="an_3:3">3:3</span> That no man should be moved in these
tribulations: for yourselves know, that we are appointed thereunto.

<span id="an_3:4">3:4</span> For even when we were with you, we foretold
you that we should suffer tribulations, as also it is come to pass, and
you know.

<span id="an_3:5">3:5</span> For this cause also, I, forbearing no
longer, sent to know your faith: lest perhaps he that tempteth should
have tempted you, and our labour should be made vain.

<span id="an_3:6">3:6</span> But now when Timothy came to us from you,
and related to us your faith and charity, and that you have a good
remembrance of us always, desiring to see us as we also to see you;

<span id="an_3:7">3:7</span> Therefore we were comforted, brethren, in
you, in all our necessity and tribulation, by your faith,

<span id="an_3:8">3:8</span> Because now we live, if you stand in the
Lord.

<span id="an_3:9">3:9</span> For what thanks can we return to God for
you, in all the joy wherewith we rejoice for you before our God,

<span id="an_3:10">3:10</span> Night and day more abundantly praying
that we may see your face, and may accomplish those things that are
wanting to your faith?

<span id="an_3:11">3:11</span> Now God himself and our Father, and our
Lord Jesus Christ, direct our way unto you.

<span id="an_3:12">3:12</span> And may the Lord multiply you, and make
you abound in charity towards one another, and towards all men: as we do
also towards you,

<span id="an_3:13">3:13</span> To confirm your hearts without blame, in
holiness, before God and our Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus
Christ, with all his saints. Amen.

<span id="an_4:1">4:1</span> For the rest therefore, brethren, we pray
and beseech you in the Lord Jesus, that as you have received from us,
how you ought to walk, and to please God, so also you would walk, that
you may abound the more.

<span id="an_4:2">4:2</span> For you know what precepts I have given to
you by the Lord Jesus.

<span id="an_4:3">4:3</span> For this is the will of God, your
sanctification; that you should abstain from fornication;

<span id="an_4:4">4:4</span> That every one of you should know how to
possess his vessel in sanctification and honour:

<span id="an_4:5">4:5</span> Not in the passion of lust, like the
Gentiles that know not God:

<span id="an_4:6">4:6</span> And that no man overreach, nor circumvent
his brother in business: because the Lord is the avenger of all these
things, as we have told you before, and have testified.

<span id="an_4:7">4:7</span> For God hath not called us unto
uncleanness, but unto sanctification.

<span id="an_4:8">4:8</span> Therefore, he that despiseth these things,
despiseth not man, but God, who also hath given his holy Spirit in us.

<span id="an_4:9">4:9</span> But as touching the charity of brotherhood,
we have no need to write to you: for yourselves have learned of God to
love one another.

<span id="an_4:10">4:10</span> For indeed you do it towards all the
brethren in all Macedonia. But we entreat you, brethren, that you abound
more:

<span id="an_4:11">4:11</span> And that you use your endeavour to be
quiet, and that you do your own business, and work with your own hands,
as we commanded you: and that you walk honestly towards them that are
without; and that you want nothing of any man's.

<span id="an_4:12">4:12</span> And we will not have you ignorant,
brethren, concerning them that are asleep, that you be not sorrowful,
even as others who have no hope.

<span id="an_4:13">4:13</span> For if we believe that Jesus died, and
rose again; even so them who have slept through Jesus, will God bring
with him.

<span id="an_4:14">4:14</span> For this we say unto you in the word of
the Lord, that we who are alive, who remain unto the coming of the Lord,
shall not prevent them who have slept.

<span id="an_4:15">4:15</span> For the Lord himself shall come down from
heaven with commandment, and with the voice of an archangel, and with
the trumpet of God: and the dead who are in Christ, shall rise first.

<span id="an_4:16">4:16</span> Then we who are alive, who are left,
shall be taken up together with them in the clouds to meet Christ, into
the air, and so shall we be always with the Lord.

<span id="an_4:17">4:17</span> Wherefore, comfort ye one another with
these words.

<span id="an_5:1">5:1</span> But of the times and moments, brethren, you
need not, that we should write to you;

<span id="an_5:2">5:2</span> For yourselves know perfectly, that the day
of the Lord shall so come, as a thief in the night.

<span id="an_5:3">5:3</span> For when they shall say, peace and
security; then shall sudden destruction come upon them, as the pains
upon her that is with child, and they shall not escape.

<span id="an_5:4">5:4</span> But you, brethren, are not in darkness,
that that day should overtake you as a thief.

<span id="an_5:5">5:5</span> For all you are the children of light, and
children of the day: we are not of the night, nor of darkness.

<span id="an_5:6">5:6</span> Therefore, let us not sleep, as others do;
but let us watch, and be sober.

<span id="an_5:7">5:7</span> For they that sleep, sleep in the night;
and they that are drunk, are drunk in the night.

<span id="an_5:8">5:8</span> But let us, who are of the day, be sober,
having on the breastplate of faith and charity, and for a helmet the
hope of salvation.

<span id="an_5:9">5:9</span> For God hath not appointed us unto wrath,
but unto the purchasing of salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ,

<span id="an_5:10">5:10</span> Who died for us; that, whether we watch
or sleep, we may live together with him.

<span id="an_5:11">5:11</span> For which cause comfort one another; and
edify one another, as you also do.

<span id="an_5:12">5:12</span> And we beseech you, brethren, to know
them who labour among you, and are over you in the Lord, and admonish
you:

<span id="an_5:13">5:13</span> That you esteem them more abundantly in
charity, for their work's sake. Have peace with them.

<span id="an_5:14">5:14</span> And we beseech you, brethren, rebuke the
unquiet, comfort the feeble minded, support the weak, be patient towards
all men.

<span id="an_5:15">5:15</span> See that none render evil for evil to any
man; but ever follow that which is good towards each other, and towards
all men.

<span id="an_5:16">5:16</span> Always rejoice.

<span id="an_5:17">5:17</span> Pray without ceasing.

<span id="an_5:18">5:18</span> In all things give thanks; for this is
the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you all.

<span id="an_5:19">5:19</span> Extinguish not the spirit.

<span id="an_5:20">5:20</span> Despise not prophecies.

<span id="an_5:21">5:21</span> But prove all things; hold fast that
which is good.

<span id="an_5:22">5:22</span> From all appearance of evil refrain
yourselves.

<span id="an_5:23">5:23</span> And may the God of peace himself sanctify
you in all things; that your whole spirit, and soul, and body, may be
preserved blameless in the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.

<span id="an_5:24">5:24</span> He is faithful who hath called you, who
also will do it.

<span id="an_5:25">5:25</span> Brethren, pray for us.

<span id="an_5:26">5:26</span> Salute all the brethren with a holy kiss.

<span id="an_5:27">5:27</span> I charge you by the Lord, that this
epistle be read to all the holy brethren.

<span id="an_5:28">5:28</span> The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be
with you. Amen.
