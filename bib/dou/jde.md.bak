### Douay-Rheims Bible: Jude

<span id="an_1:1">1:1</span> Jude, the servant of Jesus Christ, and
brother of James: to them that are beloved in God the Father, and
preserved in Jesus Christ, and called.

<span id="an_1:2">1:2</span> Mercy unto you, and peace, and charity be
fulfilled.

<span id="an_1:3">1:3</span> Dearly beloved, taking all care to write
unto you concerning your common salvation, I was under a necessity to
write unto you: to beseech you to contend earnestly for the faith once
delivered to the saints.

<span id="an_1:4">1:4</span> For certain men are secretly entered in,
(who were written of long ago unto this judgment,) ungodly men, turning
the grace of our Lord God into riotousness, and denying the only
sovereign Ruler, and our Lord Jesus Christ.

<span id="an_1:5">1:5</span> I will therefore admonish you, though ye
once knew all things, that Jesus, having saved the people out of the
land of Egypt, did afterwards destroy them that believed not:

<span id="an_1:6">1:6</span> And the angels who kept not their
principality, but forsook their own habitation, he hath reserved under
darkness in everlasting chains, unto the judgment of the great day.

<span id="an_1:7">1:7</span> As Sodom and Gomorrha, and the neighbouring
cities, in like manner, having given themselves to fornication, and
going after other flesh, were made an example, suffering the punishment
of eternal fire.

<span id="an_1:8">1:8</span> In like manner these men also defile the
flesh, and despise dominion, and blaspheme majesty.

<span id="an_1:9">1:9</span> When Michael the archangel, disputing with
the devil, contended about the body of Moses, he durst not bring against
him the judgment of railing speech, but said: The Lord command thee.

<span id="an_1:10">1:10</span> But these men blaspheme whatever things
they know not: and what things soever they naturally know, like dumb
beasts, in these they are corrupted.

<span id="an_1:11">1:11</span> Woe unto them, for they have gone in the
way of Cain: and after the error of Balaam they have for reward poured
out themselves, and have perished in the contradiction of Core.

<span id="an_1:12">1:12</span> These are spots in their banquets,
feasting together without fear, feeding themselves, clouds without
water, which are carried about by winds, trees of the autumn,
unfruitful, twice dead, plucked up by the roots,

<span id="an_1:13">1:13</span> Raging waves of the sea, foaming out
their own confusion; wandering stars, to whom the storm of darkness is
reserved for ever.

<span id="an_1:14">1:14</span> Now of these Enoch also, the seventh from
Adam, prophesied, saying: Behold, the Lord cometh with thousands of his
saints,

<span id="an_1:15">1:15</span> To execute judgment upon all, and to
reprove all the ungodly for all the works of their ungodliness, whereby
they have done ungodly, and of all the hard things which ungodly sinners
have spoken against God.

<span id="an_1:16">1:16</span> These are murmurers, full of complaints,
walking according to their own desires, and their mouth speaketh proud
things, admiring persons for gain's sake.

<span id="an_1:17">1:17</span> But you, my dearly beloved, be mindful of
the words which have been spoken before by the apostles of our Lord
Jesus Christ,

<span id="an_1:18">1:18</span> Who told you, that in the last time there
should come mockers, walking according to their own desires in
ungodlinesses.

<span id="an_1:19">1:19</span> These are they, who separate themselves,
sensual men, having not the Spirit.

<span id="an_1:20">1:20</span> But you, my beloved, building yourselves
upon you most holy faith, praying in the Holy Ghost,

<span id="an_1:21">1:21</span> Keep yourselves in the love of God,
waiting for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ, unto life everlasting.

<span id="an_1:22">1:22</span> And some indeed reprove, being judged:

<span id="an_1:23">1:23</span> But others save, pulling them out of the
fire. And on others have mercy, in fear, hating also the spotted garment
which is carnal.

<span id="an_1:24">1:24</span> Now to him who is able to preserve you
without sin, and to present you spotless before the presence of his
glory with exceeding joy, in the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ,

<span id="an_1:25">1:25</span> To the only God our Saviour through Jesus
Christ our Lord, be glory and magnificence, empire and power, before all
ages, and now, and for all ages of ages. Amen.
