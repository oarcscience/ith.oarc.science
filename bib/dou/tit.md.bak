### Douay-Rheims Bible: Titus

<span id="an_1:1">1:1</span> Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of
Jesus Christ, according to the faith of the elect of God and the
acknowledging of the truth, which is according to godliness:

<span id="an_1:2">1:2</span> Unto the hope of life everlasting, which
God, who lieth not, hath promised before the times of the world:

<span id="an_1:3">1:3</span> But hath in due times manifested his word
in preaching, which is committed to me according to the commandment of
God our Savior:

<span id="an_1:4">1:4</span> To Titus my beloved son, according to the
common faith, grace and peace from God the Father, and from Christ Jesus
our Savior.

<span id="an_1:5">1:5</span> For this cause I left thee in Crete, that
thou shouldest set in order the things that are wanting, and shouldest
ordain priests in every city, as I also appointed thee:

<span id="an_1:6">1:6</span> If any be without crime, the husband of one
wife, having faithful children, not accused of riot, or unruly.

<span id="an_1:7">1:7</span> For a bishop must be without crime, as the
steward of God: not proud, not subject to anger, not given to wine, no
striker, not greedy of filthy lucre:

<span id="an_1:8">1:8</span> But given to hospitality, gentle, sober,
just, holy, continent:

<span id="an_1:9">1:9</span> Embracing that faithful word which is
according to doctrine, that he may be able to exhort in sound doctrine,
and to convince the gainsayers.

<span id="an_1:10">1:10</span> For there are also many disobedient, vain
talkers, and seducers: especially they who are of the circumcision:

<span id="an_1:11">1:11</span> Who must be reproved, who subvert whole
houses, teaching things which they ought not, for filthy lucre's sake.

<span id="an_1:12">1:12</span> One of them a prophet of their own, said,
The Cretians are always liars, evil beasts, slothful bellies.

<span id="an_1:13">1:13</span> This testimony is true. Wherefore rebuke
them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith;

<span id="an_1:14">1:14</span> Not giving heed to Jewish fables and
commandments of men, who turn themselves away from the truth.

<span id="an_1:15">1:15</span> All things are clean to the clean: but to
them that are defiled, and to unbelievers, nothing is clean: but both
their mind and their conscience are defiled.

<span id="an_1:16">1:16</span> They profess that they know God: but in
their works they deny him; being abominable, and incredulous, and to
every good work reprobate.

<span id="an_2:1">2:1</span> But speak thou the things that become sound
doctrine:

<span id="an_2:2">2:2</span> That the aged men be sober, chaste,
prudent, sound in faith, in love, in patience.

<span id="an_2:3">2:3</span> The aged women, in like manner, in holy
attire, not false accusers, not given to much wine, teaching well:

<span id="an_2:4">2:4</span> That they may teach the young women to be
wise, to love their husbands, to love their children,

<span id="an_2:5">2:5</span> To be discreet, chaste, sober, having a
care of the house, gentle, obedient to their husbands, that the word of
God be not blasphemed.

<span id="an_2:6">2:6</span> Young men, in like manner, exhort that they
be sober.

<span id="an_2:7">2:7</span> In all things shew thyself an example of
good works, in doctrine, in integrity, in gravity,

<span id="an_2:8">2:8</span> The sound word that can not be blamed: that
he, who is on the contrary part, may be afraid, having no evil to say of
us.

<span id="an_2:9">2:9</span> Exhort servants to be obedient to their
masters, in all things pleasing, not gainsaying:

<span id="an_2:10">2:10</span> Not defrauding, but in all things shewing
good fidelity, that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Savior in all
things:

<span id="an_2:11">2:11</span> For the grace of God our Savior hath
appeared to all men;

<span id="an_2:12">2:12</span> Instructing us, that, denying ungodliness
and worldly desires, we should live soberly, and justly, and godly in
this world,

<span id="an_2:13">2:13</span> Looking for the blessed hope and coming
of the glory of the great God and our Savior Jesus Christ,

<span id="an_2:14">2:14</span> Who gave himself for us, that he might
redeem us from all iniquity, and might cleanse to himself a people
acceptable, a pursuer of good works.

<span id="an_2:15">2:15</span> These things speak, and exhort and rebuke
with all authority. Let no man despise thee.

<span id="an_3:1">3:1</span> Admonish them to be subject to princes and
powers, to obey at a word, to be ready to every good work.

<span id="an_3:2">3:2</span> To speak evil of no man, not to be
litigious, but gentle: shewing all mildness towards all men.

<span id="an_3:3">3:3</span> For we ourselves also were some time
unwise, incredulous, erring, slaves to divers desires and pleasures,
living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another.

<span id="an_3:4">3:4</span> But when the goodness and kindness of God
our Savior appeared:

<span id="an_3:5">3:5</span> Not by the works of justice, which we have
done, but according to his mercy, he saved us, by the laver of
regeneration, and renovation of the Holy Ghost;

<span id="an_3:6">3:6</span> Whom he hath poured forth upon us
abundantly, through Jesus Christ our Savior:

<span id="an_3:7">3:7</span> That, being justified by his grace, we may
be heirs, according to hope of life everlasting.

<span id="an_3:8">3:8</span> It is a faithful saying: and these things I
will have thee affirm constantly: that they, who believe in God, may be
careful to excel in good works. These things are good and profitable
unto men.

<span id="an_3:9">3:9</span> But avoid foolish questions, and
genealogies, and contentions, and strivings about the law. For they are
unprofitable and vain.

<span id="an_3:10">3:10</span> A man that is a heretic, after the first
and second admonition, avoid:

<span id="an_3:11">3:11</span> Knowing that he, that is such an one, is
subverted, and sinneth, being condemned by his own judgment.

<span id="an_3:12">3:12</span> When I shall send to thee Artemas or
Tychicus, make haste to come unto me to Nicopolis. For there I have
determined to winter.

<span id="an_3:13">3:13</span> Send forward Zenas, the lawyer, and
Apollo, with care, that nothing be wanting to them.

<span id="an_3:14">3:14</span> And let our men also learn to excel in
good works for necessary uses: that they be not unfruitful.

<span id="an_3:15">3:15</span> All that are with me salute thee: salute
them that love us in the faith. The grace of God be with you all. Amen.
