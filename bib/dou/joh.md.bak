### Douay-Rheims Bible: John

<span id="an_1:1">1:1</span> IN the beginning was the Word, and the Word
was with God, and the Word was God.

<span id="an_1:2">1:2</span> The same was in the beginning with God.

<span id="an_1:3">1:3</span> All things were made by him: and without
him was made nothing that was made.

<span id="an_1:4">1:4</span> In him was life, and the life was the light
of men.

<span id="an_1:5">1:5</span> And the light shineth in darkness, and the
darkness did not comprehend it.

<span id="an_1:6">1:6</span> There was a man sent from God, whose name
was John.

<span id="an_1:7">1:7</span> This man came for a witness, to give
testimony of the light, that all men might believe through him.

<span id="an_1:8">1:8</span> He was not the light, but was to give
testimony of the light.

<span id="an_1:9">1:9</span> That was the true light, which enlighteneth
every man that cometh into this world.

<span id="an_1:10">1:10</span> He was in the world, and the world was
made by him, and the world knew him not.

<span id="an_1:11">1:11</span> He came unto his own, and his own
received him not.

<span id="an_1:12">1:12</span> But as many as received him, he gave them
power to be made the sons of God, to them that believe in his name.

<span id="an_1:13">1:13</span> Who are born, not of blood, nor of the
will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.

<span id="an_1:14">1:14</span> And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt
among us, (and we saw his glory, the glory as it were of the only
begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.

<span id="an_1:15">1:15</span> John beareth witness of him, and crieth
out, saying: This was he of whom I spoke: He that shall come after me,
is preferred before me: because he was before me.

<span id="an_1:16">1:16</span> And of his fulness we all have received,
and grace for grace.

<span id="an_1:17">1:17</span> For the law was given by Moses; grace and
truth came by Jesus Christ.

<span id="an_1:18">1:18</span> No man hath seen God at any time: the
only begotten Son who is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared
him.

<span id="an_1:19">1:19</span> And this is the testimony of John, when
the Jews sent from Jerusalem priests and Levites to him, to ask him: Who
art thou?

<span id="an_1:20">1:20</span> And he confessed, and did not deny: and
he confessed: I am not the Christ.

<span id="an_1:21">1:21</span> And they asked him: What then? Art thou
Elias? And he said: I am not. Art thou the prophet? And he answered: No.

<span id="an_1:22">1:22</span> They said therefore unto him: Who art
thou, that we may give an answer to them that sent us? What sayest thou
of thyself?

<span id="an_1:23">1:23</span> He said: I am the voice of one crying out
in the wilderness, make straight the way of the Lord, as said the
prophet Isaias.

<span id="an_1:24">1:24</span> And they that were sent, were of the
Pharisees.

<span id="an_1:25">1:25</span> And they asked him, and said to him: Why
then dost thou baptize, if thou be not Christ, nor Elias, nor the
prophet?

<span id="an_1:26">1:26</span> John answered them, saying: I baptize
with water; but there hath stood one in the midst of you, whom you know
not.

<span id="an_1:27">1:27</span> The same is he that shall come after me,
who is preferred before me: the latchet of whose shoe I am not worthy to
loose.

<span id="an_1:28">1:28</span> These things were done in Bethania,
beyond the Jordan, where John was baptizing.

<span id="an_1:29">1:29</span> The next day, John saw Jesus coming to
him, and he saith: Behold the Lamb of God, behold him who taketh away
the sin of the world.

<span id="an_1:30">1:30</span> This is he, of whom I said: After me
there cometh a man, who is preferred before me: because he was before
me.

<span id="an_1:31">1:31</span> And I knew him not, but that he may be
made manifest in Israel, therefore am I come baptizing with water.

<span id="an_1:32">1:32</span> And John gave testimony, saying: I saw
the Spirit coming down, as a dove from heaven, and he remained upon him.

<span id="an_1:33">1:33</span> And I knew him not; but he who sent me to
baptize with water, said to me: He upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit
descending, and remaining upon him, he it is that baptizeth with the
Holy Ghost.

<span id="an_1:34">1:34</span> And I saw, and I gave testimony, that
this is the Son of God.

<span id="an_1:35">1:35</span> The next day again John stood, and two of
his disciples.

<span id="an_1:36">1:36</span> And beholding Jesus walking, he saith:
Behold the Lamb of God.

<span id="an_1:37">1:37</span> And the two disciples heard him speak,
and they followed Jesus.

<span id="an_1:38">1:38</span> And Jesus turning, and seeing them
following him, saith to them: What seek you? Who said to him, Rabbi,
(which is to say, being interpreted, Master,) where dwellest thou?

<span id="an_1:39">1:39</span> He saith to them: Come and see. They
came, and saw where he abode, and they stayed with him that day: now it
was about the tenth hour.

<span id="an_1:40">1:40</span> And Andrew, the brother of Simon Peter,
was one of the two who had heard of John, and followed him.

<span id="an_1:41">1:41</span> He findeth first his brother Simon, and
saith to him: We have found the Messias, which is, being interpreted,
the Christ.

<span id="an_1:42">1:42</span> And he brought him to Jesus. And Jesus
looking upon him, said: Thou art Simon the son of Jona: thou shalt be
called Cephas, which is interpreted Peter.

<span id="an_1:43">1:43</span> On the following day, he would go forth
into Galilee, and he findeth Philip. And Jesus saith to him: Follow me.

<span id="an_1:44">1:44</span> Now Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of
Andrew and Peter.

<span id="an_1:45">1:45</span> Philip findeth Nathanael, and saith to
him: We have found him of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets did
write, Jesus the son of Joseph of Nazareth.

<span id="an_1:46">1:46</span> And Nathanael said to him: Can any thing
of good come from Nazareth? Philip saith to him: Come and see.

<span id="an_1:47">1:47</span> Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him: and he
saith of him: Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom there is no guile.

<span id="an_1:48">1:48</span> Nathanael saith to him: Whence knowest
thou me? Jesus answered, and said to him: Before that Philip called
thee, when thou wast under the fig tree, I saw thee.

<span id="an_1:49">1:49</span> Nathanael answered him, and said: Rabbi,
thou art the Son of God, thou art the King of Israel.

<span id="an_1:50">1:50</span> Jesus answered, and said to him: Because
I said unto thee, I saw thee under the fig tree, thou believest: greater
things than these shalt thou see.

<span id="an_1:51">1:51</span> And he saith to him: Amen, amen I say to
you, you shall see the heaven opened, and the angels of God ascending
and descending upon the Son of man.

<span id="an_2:1">2:1</span> AND the third day, there was a marriage in
Cana of Galilee: and the mother of Jesus was there.

<span id="an_2:2">2:2</span> And Jesus also was invited, and his
disciples, to the marriage.

<span id="an_2:3">2:3</span> And the wine failing, the mother of Jesus
saith to him: They have no wine.

<span id="an_2:4">2:4</span> And Jesus saith to her: Woman, what is that
to me and to thee? my hour is not yet come.

<span id="an_2:5">2:5</span> His mother saith to the waiters: Whatsoever
he shall say to you, do ye.

<span id="an_2:6">2:6</span> Now there were set there six waterpots of
stone, according to the manner of the purifying of the Jews, containing
two or three measures apiece.

<span id="an_2:7">2:7</span> Jesus saith to them: Fill the waterpots
with water. And they filled them up to the brim.

<span id="an_2:8">2:8</span> And Jesus saith to them: Draw out now, and
carry to the chief steward of the feast. And they carried it.

<span id="an_2:9">2:9</span> And when the chief steward had tasted the
water made wine, and knew not whence it was, but the waiters knew who
had drawn the water; the chief steward calleth the bridegroom,

<span id="an_2:10">2:10</span> And saith to him: Every man at first
setteth forth good wine, and when men have well drunk, then that which
is worse. But thou hast kept the good wine until now.

<span id="an_2:11">2:11</span> This beginning of miracles did Jesus in
Cana of Galilee; and manifested his glory, and his disciples believed in
him.

<span id="an_2:12">2:12</span> After this he went down to Capharnaum, he
and his mother, and his brethren, and his disciples: and they remained
there not many days.

<span id="an_2:13">2:13</span> And the pasch of the Jews was at hand,
and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.

<span id="an_2:14">2:14</span> And he found in the temple them that sold
oxen and sheep and doves, and the changers of money sitting.

<span id="an_2:15">2:15</span> And when he had made, as it were, a
scourge of little cords, he drove them all out of the temple, the sheep
also and the oxen, and the money of the changers he poured out, and the
tables he overthrew.

<span id="an_2:16">2:16</span> And to them that sold doves he said: Take
these things hence, and make not the house of my Father a house of
traffic.

<span id="an_2:17">2:17</span> And his disciples remembered, that it was
written: The zeal of thy house hath eaten me up.

<span id="an_2:18">2:18</span> The Jews, therefore, answered, and said
to him: What sign dost thou shew unto us, seeing thou dost these things?

<span id="an_2:19">2:19</span> Jesus answered, and said to them: Destroy
this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.

<span id="an_2:20">2:20</span> The Jews then said: Six and forty years
was this temple in building; and wilt thou raise it up in three days?

<span id="an_2:21">2:21</span> But he spoke of the temple of his body.

<span id="an_2:22">2:22</span> When therefore he was risen again from
the dead, his disciples remembered, that he had said this, and they
believed the scripture, and the word that Jesus had said.

<span id="an_2:23">2:23</span> Now when he was at Jerusalem, at the
pasch, upon the festival day, many believed in his name, seeing his
signs which he did.

<span id="an_2:24">2:24</span> But Jesus did not trust himself unto
them, for that he knew all men,

<span id="an_2:25">2:25</span> And because he needed not that any should
give testimony of man: for he knew what was in man.

<span id="an_3:1">3:1</span> AND there was a man of the Pharisees, named
Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews.

<span id="an_3:2">3:2</span> This man came to Jesus by night, and said
to him: Rabbi, we know that thou art come a teacher from God; for no man
can do these signs which thou dost, unless God be with him.

<span id="an_3:3">3:3</span> Jesus answered, and said to him: Amen, amen
I say to thee, unless a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of
God.

<span id="an_3:4">3:4</span> Nicodemus saith to him: How can a man be
born when he is old? can he enter a second time into his mother's womb,
and be born again?

<span id="an_3:5">3:5</span> Jesus answered: Amen, amen I say to thee,
unless a man be born again of water and the Holy Ghost, he cannot enter
into the kingdom of God.

<span id="an_3:6">3:6</span> That which is born of the flesh, is flesh;
and that which is born of the Spirit, is spirit.

<span id="an_3:7">3:7</span> Wonder not, that I said to thee, you must
be born again.

<span id="an_3:8">3:8</span> The Spirit breatheth where he will; and
thou hearest his voice, but thou knowest not whence he cometh, and
whither he goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit.

<span id="an_3:9">3:9</span> Nicodemus answered, and said to him: How
can these things be done?

<span id="an_3:10">3:10</span> Jesus answered, and said to him: Art thou
a master in Israel, and knowest not these things?

<span id="an_3:11">3:11</span> Amen, amen I say to thee, that we speak
what we know, and we testify what we have seen, and you receive not our
testimony.

<span id="an_3:12">3:12</span> If I have spoken to you earthly things,
and you believe not; how will you believe, if I shall speak to you
heavenly things?

<span id="an_3:13">3:13</span> And no man hath ascended into heaven, but
he that descended from heaven, the Son of man who is in heaven.

<span id="an_3:14">3:14</span> And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the
desert, so must the Son of man be lifted up:

<span id="an_3:15">3:15</span> That whosoever believeth in him, may not
perish; but may have life everlasting.

<span id="an_3:16">3:16</span> For God so loved the world, as to give
his only begotten Son; that whosoever believeth in him, may not perish,
but may have life everlasting.

<span id="an_3:17">3:17</span> For God sent not his Son into the world,
to judge the world, but that the world may be saved by him.

<span id="an_3:18">3:18</span> He that believeth in him is not judged.
But he that doth not believe, is already judged: because he believeth
not in the name of the only begotten Son of God.

<span id="an_3:19">3:19</span> And this is the judgment: because the
light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than the
light: for their works were evil.

<span id="an_3:20">3:20</span> For every one that doth evil hateth the
light, and cometh not to the light, that his works may not be reproved.

<span id="an_3:21">3:21</span> But he that doth truth, cometh to the
light, that his works may be made manifest, because they are done in
God.

<span id="an_3:22">3:22</span> After these things Jesus and his
disciples came into the land of Judea: and there he abode with them, and
baptized.

<span id="an_3:23">3:23</span> And John also was baptizing in Ennon near
Salim; because there was much water there; and they came and were
baptized.

<span id="an_3:24">3:24</span> For John was not yet cast into prison.

<span id="an_3:25">3:25</span> And there arose a question between some
of John's disciples and the Jews concerning purification:

<span id="an_3:26">3:26</span> And they came to John, and said to him:
Rabbi, he that was with thee beyond the Jordan, to whom thou gavest
testimony, behold he baptizeth, and all men come to him.

<span id="an_3:27">3:27</span> John answered, and said: A man cannot
receive any thing, unless it be given him from heaven.

<span id="an_3:28">3:28</span> You yourselves do bear me witness, that I
said, I am not Christ, but that I am sent before him.

<span id="an_3:29">3:29</span> He that hath the bride, is the
bridegroom: but the friend of the bridegroom, who standeth and heareth
him, rejoiceth with joy because of the bridegroom's voice. This my joy
therefore is fulfilled.

<span id="an_3:30">3:30</span> He must increase, but I must decrease.

<span id="an_3:31">3:31</span> He that cometh from above, is above all.
He that is of the earth, of the earth he is, and of the earth he
speaketh. He that cometh from heaven, is above all.

<span id="an_3:32">3:32</span> And what he hath seen and heard, that he
testifieth: and no man receiveth his testimony.

<span id="an_3:33">3:33</span> He that hath received his testimony, hath
set to his seal that God is true.

<span id="an_3:34">3:34</span> For he whom God hath sent, speaketh the
words of God: for God doth not give the Spirit by measure.

<span id="an_3:35">3:35</span> The Father loveth the Son: and he hath
given all things into his hand.

<span id="an_3:36">3:36</span> He that believeth in the Son, hath life
everlasting; but he that believeth not the Son, shall not see life; but
the wrath of God abideth on him.

<span id="an_4:1">4:1</span> WHEN Jesus therefore understood that the
Pharisees had heard that Jesus maketh more disciples, and baptizeth more
than John,

<span id="an_4:2">4:2</span> (Though Jesus himself did not baptize, but
his disciples,)

<span id="an_4:3">4:3</span> He left Judea, and went again into Galilee.

<span id="an_4:4">4:4</span> And he was of necessity to pass through
Samaria.

<span id="an_4:5">4:5</span> He cometh therefore to a city of Samaria,
which is called Sichar, near the land which Jacob gave to his son
Joseph.

<span id="an_4:6">4:6</span> Now Jacob's well was there. Jesus therefore
being wearied with his journey, sat thus on the well. It was about the
sixth hour.

<span id="an_4:7">4:7</span> There cometh a woman of Samaria, to draw
water. Jesus saith to her: Give me to drink.

<span id="an_4:8">4:8</span> For his disciples were gone into the city
to buy meats.

<span id="an_4:9">4:9</span> Then that Samaritan woman saith to him: How
dost thou, being a Jew, ask of me to drink, who am a Samaritan woman?
For the Jews do not communicate with the Samaritans.

<span id="an_4:10">4:10</span> Jesus answered, and said to her: If thou
didst know the gift of God, and who he is that saith to thee, Give me to
drink; thou perhaps wouldst have asked of him, and he would have given
thee living water.

<span id="an_4:11">4:11</span> The woman saith to him: Sir, thou hast
nothing wherein to draw, and the well is deep; from whence then hast
thou living water?

<span id="an_4:12">4:12</span> Art thou greater than our father Jacob,
who gave us the well, and drank thereof himself, and his children, and
his cattle?

<span id="an_4:13">4:13</span> Jesus answered, and said to her:
Whosoever drinketh of this water, shall thirst again; but he that shall
drink of the water that I will give him, shall not thirst for ever:

<span id="an_4:14">4:14</span> But the water that I will give him, shall
become in him a fountain of water, springing up into life everlasting.

<span id="an_4:15">4:15</span> The woman saith to him: Sir, give me this
water, that I may not thirst, nor come hither to draw.

<span id="an_4:16">4:16</span> Jesus saith to her: Go, call thy husband,
and come hither.

<span id="an_4:17">4:17</span> The woman answered, and said: I have no
husband. Jesus said to her: Thou hast said well, I have no husband:

<span id="an_4:18">4:18</span> For thou hast had five husbands: and he
whom thou now hast, is not thy husband. This thou hast said truly.

<span id="an_4:19">4:19</span> The woman saith to him: Sir, I perceive
that thou art a prophet.

<span id="an_4:20">4:20</span> Our fathers adored on this mountain, and
you say, that at Jerusalem is the place where men must adore.

<span id="an_4:21">4:21</span> Jesus saith to her: Woman, believe me,
that the hour cometh, when you shall neither on this mountain, not in
Jerusalem, adore the Father.

<span id="an_4:22">4:22</span> You adore that which you know not: we
adore that which we know; for salvation is of the Jews.

<span id="an_4:23">4:23</span> But the hour cometh, and now is, when the
true adorers shall adore the Father in spirit and in truth. For the
Father also seeketh such to adore him.

<span id="an_4:24">4:24</span> God is a spirit; and they that adore him,
must adore him in spirit and in truth.

<span id="an_4:25">4:25</span> The woman saith to him: I know that the
Messias cometh (who is called Christ); therefore, when he is come, he
will tell us all things.

<span id="an_4:26">4:26</span> Jesus saith to her: I am he, who am
speaking with thee.

<span id="an_4:27">4:27</span> And immediately his disciples came; and
they wondered that he talked with the woman. Yet no man said: What
seekest thou? or, why talkest thou with her?

<span id="an_4:28">4:28</span> The woman therefore left her waterpot,
and went her way into the city, and saith to the men there:

<span id="an_4:29">4:29</span> Come, and see a man who has told me all
things whatsoever I have done. Is not he the Christ?

<span id="an_4:30">4:30</span> They went therefore out of the city, and
came unto him.

<span id="an_4:31">4:31</span> In the mean time the disciples prayed
him, saying: Rabbi, eat.

<span id="an_4:32">4:32</span> But he said to them: I have meat to eat,
which you know not.

<span id="an_4:33">4:33</span> The disciples therefore said one to
another: Hath any man brought him to eat?

<span id="an_4:34">4:34</span> Jesus saith to them: My meat is to do the
will of him that sent me, that I may perfect his work.

<span id="an_4:35">4:35</span> Do you not say, There are yet four
months, and then the harvest cometh? Behold, I say to you, lift up your
eyes, and see the countries; for they are white already to harvest.

<span id="an_4:36">4:36</span> And he that reapeth receiveth wages, and
gathereth fruit unto life everlasting: that both he that soweth, and he
that reapeth, may rejoice together.

<span id="an_4:37">4:37</span> For in this is the saying true: That it
is one man that soweth, and it is another that reapeth.

<span id="an_4:38">4:38</span> I have sent you to reap that in which you
did not labour: others have laboured, and you have entered into their
labours.

<span id="an_4:39">4:39</span> Now of that city many of the Samaritans
believed in him, for the word of the woman giving testimony: He told me
all things whatsoever I have done.

<span id="an_4:40">4:40</span> So when the Samaritans were come to him,
they desired that he would tarry there. And he abode there two days.

<span id="an_4:41">4:41</span> And many more believed in him because of
his own word.

<span id="an_4:42">4:42</span> And they said to the woman: We now
believe, not for thy saying: for we ourselves have heard him, and know
that this is indeed the Saviour of the world.

<span id="an_4:43">4:43</span> Now after two days, he departed thence,
and went into Galilee.

<span id="an_4:44">4:44</span> For Jesus himself gave testimony that a
prophet hath no honour in his own country.

<span id="an_4:45">4:45</span> And when he was come into Galilee, the
Galileans received him, having seen all the things he had done at
Jerusalem on the festival day; for they also went to the festival day.

<span id="an_4:46">4:46</span> He came again therefore into Cana of
Galilee, where he made the water wine. And there was a certain ruler,
whose son was sick at Capharnaum.

<span id="an_4:47">4:47</span> He having heard that Jesus was come from
Judea into Galilee, went to him, and prayed him to come down, and heal
his son; for he was at the point of death.

<span id="an_4:48">4:48</span> Jesus therefore said to him: Unless you
see signs and wonders, you believe not.

<span id="an_4:49">4:49</span> The ruler saith to him: Lord, come down
before that my son die.

<span id="an_4:50">4:50</span> Jesus saith to him: Go thy way; thy son
liveth. The man believed the word which Jesus said to him, and went his
way.

<span id="an_4:51">4:51</span> And as he was going down, his servants
met him; and they brought word, saying, that his son lived.

<span id="an_4:52">4:52</span> He asked therefore of them the hour
wherein he grew better. And they said to him: Yesterday, at the seventh
hour, the fever left him.

<span id="an_4:53">4:53</span> The father therefore knew, that it was at
the same hour that Jesus said to him, Thy son liveth; and himself
believed, and his whole house.

<span id="an_4:54">4:54</span> This is again the second miracle that
Jesus did, when he was come out of Judea into Galilee.

<span id="an_5:1">5:1</span> AFTER these things was a festival day of
the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.

<span id="an_5:2">5:2</span> Now there is at Jerusalem a pond, called
Probatica, which in Hebrew is named Bethsaida, having five porches.

<span id="an_5:3">5:3</span> In these lay a great multitude of sick, of
blind, of lame, of withered; waiting for the moving of the water.

<span id="an_5:4">5:4</span> And an angel of the Lord descended at
certain times into the pond; and the water was moved. And he that went
down first into the pond after the motion of the water, was made whole,
of whatsoever infirmity he lay under.

<span id="an_5:5">5:5</span> And there was a certain man there, that had
been eight and thirty years under his infirmity.

<span id="an_5:6">5:6</span> Him when Jesus had seen lying, and knew
that he had been now a long time, he saith to him: Wilt thou be made
whole?

<span id="an_5:7">5:7</span> The infirm man answered him: Sir, I have no
man, when the water is troubled, to put me into the pond. For whilst I
am coming, another goeth down before me.

<span id="an_5:8">5:8</span> Jesus saith to him: Arise, take up thy bed,
and walk.

<span id="an_5:9">5:9</span> And immediately the man was made whole: and
he took up his bed, and walked. And it was the sabbath that day.

<span id="an_5:10">5:10</span> The Jews therefore said to him that was
healed: It is the sabbath; it is not lawful for thee to take up thy bed.

<span id="an_5:11">5:11</span> He answered them: He that made me whole,
he said to me, Take up thy bed, and walk.

<span id="an_5:12">5:12</span> They asked him therefore: Who is that man
who said to thee, Take up thy bed, and walk?

<span id="an_5:13">5:13</span> But he who was healed, knew not who it
was; for Jesus went aside from the multitude standing in the place.

<span id="an_5:14">5:14</span> Afterwards, Jesus findeth him in the
temple, and saith to him: Behold thou art made whole: sin no more, lest
some worse thing happen to thee.

<span id="an_5:15">5:15</span> The man went his way, and told the Jews,
that it was Jesus who had made him whole.

<span id="an_5:16">5:16</span> Therefore did the Jews persecute Jesus,
because he did these things on the sabbath.

<span id="an_5:17">5:17</span> But Jesus answered them: My Father
worketh until now; and I work.

<span id="an_5:18">5:18</span> Hereupon therefore the Jews sought the
more to kill him, because he did not only break the sabbath, but also
said God was his Father, making himself equal to God.

<span id="an_5:19">5:19</span> Then Jesus answered, and said to them:
Amen, amen, I say unto you, the Son cannot do any thing of himself, but
what he seeth the Father doing: for what things soever he doth, these
the Son also doth in like manner.

<span id="an_5:20">5:20</span> For the Father loveth the Son, and
sheweth him all things which himself doth: and greater works than these
will he shew him, that you may wonder.

<span id="an_5:21">5:21</span> For as the Father raiseth up the dead,
and giveth life: so the Son also giveth life to whom he will.

<span id="an_5:22">5:22</span> For neither doth the Father judge any
man, but hath given all judgment to the Son.

<span id="an_5:23">5:23</span> That all men may honour the Son, as they
honour the Father. He who honoureth not the Son, honoureth not the
Father, who hath sent him.

<span id="an_5:24">5:24</span> Amen, amen I say unto you, that he who
heareth my word, and believeth him that sent me, hath life everlasting;
and cometh not into judgment, but is passed from death to life.

<span id="an_5:25">5:25</span> Amen, amen I say unto you, that the hour
cometh, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of
God, and they that hear shall live.

<span id="an_5:26">5:26</span> For as the Father hath life in himself,
so he hath given the Son also to have life in himself:

<span id="an_5:27">5:27</span> And he hath given him power to do
judgment, because he is the Son of man.

<span id="an_5:28">5:28</span> Wonder not at this; for the hour cometh,
wherein all that are in the graves shall hear the voice of the Son of
God.

<span id="an_5:29">5:29</span> And they that have done good things,
shall come forth unto the resurrection of life; but they that have done
evil, unto the resurrection of judgment.

<span id="an_5:30">5:30</span> I cannot of myself do any thing. As I
hear, so I judge: and my judgment is just; because I seek not my own
will, but the will of him that sent me.

<span id="an_5:31">5:31</span> If I bear witness of myself, my witness
is not true.

<span id="an_5:32">5:32</span> There is another that beareth witness of
me; and I know that the witness which he witnesseth of me is true.

<span id="an_5:33">5:33</span> You sent to John, and he gave testimony
to the truth.

<span id="an_5:34">5:34</span> But I receive not testimony from man: but
I say these things, that you may be saved.

<span id="an_5:35">5:35</span> He was a burning and a shining light: and
you were willing for a time to rejoice in his light.

<span id="an_5:36">5:36</span> But I have a greater testimony than that
of John: for the works which the Father hath given me to perfect; the
works themselves, which I do, give testimony of me, that the Father hath
sent me.

<span id="an_5:37">5:37</span> And the Father himself who hath sent me,
hath given testimony of me: neither have you heard his voice at any
time, nor seen his shape.

<span id="an_5:38">5:38</span> And you have not his word abiding in you:
for whom he hath sent, him you believe not.

<span id="an_5:39">5:39</span> Search the scriptures, for you think in
them to have life everlasting; and the same are they that give testimony
of me.

<span id="an_5:40">5:40</span> And you will not come to me that you may
have life.

<span id="an_5:41">5:41</span> I receive glory not from men.

<span id="an_5:42">5:42</span> But I know you, that you have not the
love of God in you.

<span id="an_5:43">5:43</span> I am come in the name of my Father, and
you receive me not: if another shall come in his own name, him you will
receive.

<span id="an_5:44">5:44</span> How can you believe, who receive glory
one from another: and the glory which is from God alone, you do not
seek?

<span id="an_5:45">5:45</span> Think not that I will accuse you to the
Father. There is one that accuseth you, Moses, in whom you trust.

<span id="an_5:46">5:46</span> For if you did believe Moses, you would
perhaps believe me also; for he wrote of me.

<span id="an_5:47">5:47</span> But if you do not believe his writings,
how will you believe my words?

<span id="an_6:1">6:1</span> AFTER these things Jesus went over the sea
of Galilee, which is that of Tiberias.

<span id="an_6:2">6:2</span> And a great multitude followed him, because
they saw the miracles which he did on them that were diseased.

<span id="an_6:3">6:3</span> Jesus therefore went up into a mountain,
and there he sat with his disciples.

<span id="an_6:4">6:4</span> Now the pasch, the festival day of the
Jews, was near at hand.

<span id="an_6:5">6:5</span> When Jesus therefore had lifted up his
eyes, and seen that a very great multitude cometh to him, he said to
Philip: Whence shall we buy bread, that these may eat?

<span id="an_6:6">6:6</span> And this he said to try him; for he himself
knew what he would do.

<span id="an_6:7">6:7</span> Philip answered him: Two hundred pennyworth
of bread is not sufficient for them, that every one may take a little.

<span id="an_6:8">6:8</span> One of his disciples, Andrew, the brother
of Simon Peter, saith to him:

<span id="an_6:9">6:9</span> There is a boy here that hath five barley
loaves, and two fishes; but what are these among so many?

<span id="an_6:10">6:10</span> Then Jesus said: Make the men sit down.
Now there was much grass in the place. The men therefore sat down, in
number about five thousand.

<span id="an_6:11">6:11</span> And Jesus took the loaves: and when he
had given thanks, he distributed to them that were set down. In like
manner also of the fishes, as much as they would.

<span id="an_6:12">6:12</span> And when they were filled, he said to his
disciples: Gather up the fragments that remain, lest they be lost.

<span id="an_6:13">6:13</span> They gathered up therefore, and filled
twelve baskets with the fragments of the five barley loaves, which
remained over and above to them that had eaten.

<span id="an_6:14">6:14</span> Now those men, when they had seen what a
miracle Jesus had done, said: This is of a truth the prophet, that is to
come into the world.

<span id="an_6:15">6:15</span> Jesus therefore, when he knew that they
would come to take him by force, and make him king, fled again into the
mountain himself alone.

<span id="an_6:16">6:16</span> And when evening was come, his disciples
went down to the sea.

<span id="an_6:17">6:17</span> And when they had gone up into a ship,
they went over the sea to Capharnaum; and it was now dark, and Jesus was
not come unto them.

<span id="an_6:18">6:18</span> And the sea arose, by reason of a great
wind that blew.

<span id="an_6:19">6:19</span> When they had rowed therefore about five
and twenty or thirty furlongs, they see Jesus walking upon the sea, and
drawing nigh to the ship, and they were afraid.

<span id="an_6:20">6:20</span> But he saith to them: It is I; be not
afraid.

<span id="an_6:21">6:21</span> They were willing therefore to take him
into the ship; and presently the ship was at the land to which they were
going.

<span id="an_6:22">6:22</span> The next day, the multitude that stood on
the other side of the sea, saw that there was no other ship there but
one, and that Jesus had not entered into the ship with his disciples,
but that his disciples were gone away alone.

<span id="an_6:23">6:23</span> But other ships came in from Tiberias;
nigh unto the place where they had eaten the bread, the Lord giving
thanks.

<span id="an_6:24">6:24</span> When therefore the multitude saw that
Jesus was not there, nor his disciples, they took shipping, and came to
Capharnaum, seeking for Jesus.

<span id="an_6:25">6:25</span> And when they had found him on the other
side of the sea, they said to him: Rabbi, when camest thou hither?

<span id="an_6:26">6:26</span> Jesus answered them, and said: Amen, amen
I say to you, you seek me, not because you have seen miracles, but
because you did eat of the loaves, and were filled.

<span id="an_6:27">6:27</span> Labour not for the meat which perisheth,
but for that which endureth unto life everlasting, which the Son of man
will give you. For him hath God, the Father, sealed.

<span id="an_6:28">6:28</span> They said therefore unto him: What shall
we do, that we may work the works of God?

<span id="an_6:29">6:29</span> Jesus answered, and said to them: This is
the work of God, that you believe in him whom he hath sent.

<span id="an_6:30">6:30</span> They said therefore to him: What sign
therefore dost thou shew, that we may see, and may believe thee? What
dost thou work?

<span id="an_6:31">6:31</span> Our fathers did eat manna in the desert,
as it is written: He gave them bread from heaven to eat.

<span id="an_6:32">6:32</span> Then Jesus said to them: Amen, amen I say
to you; Moses gave you not bread from heaven, but my Father giveth you
the true bread from heaven.

<span id="an_6:33">6:33</span> For the bread of God is that which cometh
down from heaven, and giveth life to the world.

<span id="an_6:34">6:34</span> They said therefore unto him: Lord, give
us always this bread.

<span id="an_6:35">6:35</span> And Jesus said to them: I am the bread of
life: he that cometh to me shall not hunger: and he that believeth in me
shall never thirst.

<span id="an_6:36">6:36</span> But I said unto you, that you also have
seen me, and you believe not.

<span id="an_6:37">6:37</span> All that the Father giveth to me shall
come to me; and him that cometh to me, I will not cast out.

<span id="an_6:38">6:38</span> Because I came down from heaven, not to
do my own will, but the will of him that sent me.

<span id="an_6:39">6:39</span> Now this is the will of the Father who
sent me: that of all that he hath given me, I should lose nothing; but
should raise it up again in the last day.

<span id="an_6:40">6:40</span> And this is the will of my Father that
sent me: that every one who seeth the Son, and believeth in him, may
have life everlasting, and I will raise him up in the last day.

<span id="an_6:41">6:41</span> The Jews therefore murmured at him,
because he had said: I am the living bread which came down from heaven.

<span id="an_6:42">6:42</span> And they said: Is not this Jesus, the son
of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How then saith he, I came
down from heaven?

<span id="an_6:43">6:43</span> Jesus therefore answered, and said to
them: Murmur not among yourselves.

<span id="an_6:44">6:44</span> No man can come to me, except the Father,
who hath sent me, draw him; and I will raise him up in the last day.

<span id="an_6:45">6:45</span> It is written in the prophets: And they
shall all be taught of God. Every one that hath heard of the Father, and
hath learned, cometh to me.

<span id="an_6:46">6:46</span> Not that any man hath seen the Father;
but he who is of God, he hath seen the Father.

<span id="an_6:47">6:47</span> Amen, amen I say unto you: He that
believeth in me, hath everlasting life.

<span id="an_6:48">6:48</span> I am the bread of life.

<span id="an_6:49">6:49</span> Your fathers did eat manna in the desert,
and are dead.

<span id="an_6:50">6:50</span> This is the bread which cometh down from
heaven; that if any man eat of it, he may not die.

<span id="an_6:51">6:51</span> I am the living bread which came down
from heaven.

<span id="an_6:52">6:52</span> If any man eat of this bread, he shall
live for ever; and the bread that I will give, is my flesh, for the life
of the world.

<span id="an_6:53">6:53</span> The Jews therefore strove among
themselves, saying: How can this man give us his flesh to eat?

<span id="an_6:54">6:54</span> Then Jesus said to them: Amen, amen I say
unto you: Except you eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his
blood, you shall not have life in you.

<span id="an_6:55">6:55</span> He that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my
blood, hath everlasting life: and I will raise him up in the last day.

<span id="an_6:56">6:56</span> For my flesh is meat indeed: and my blood
is drink indeed.

<span id="an_6:57">6:57</span> He that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my
blood, abideth in me, and I in him.

<span id="an_6:58">6:58</span> As the living Father hath sent me, and I
live by the Father; so he that eateth me, the same also shall live by
me.

<span id="an_6:59">6:59</span> This is the bread that came down from
heaven. Not as your fathers did eat manna, and are dead. He that eateth
this bread, shall live for ever.

<span id="an_6:60">6:60</span> These things he said, teaching in the
synagogue, in Capharnaum.

<span id="an_6:61">6:61</span> Many therefore of his disciples, hearing
it, said: This saying is hard, and who can hear it?

<span id="an_6:62">6:62</span> But Jesus, knowing in himself, that his
disciples murmured at this, said to them: Doth this scandalize you?

<span id="an_6:63">6:63</span> If then you shall see the Son of man
ascend up where he was before?

<span id="an_6:64">6:64</span> It is the spirit that quickeneth: the
flesh profiteth nothing. The words that I have spoken to you, are spirit
and life.

<span id="an_6:65">6:65</span> But there are some of you that believe
not. For Jesus knew from the beginning, who they were that did not
believe, and who he was, that would betray him.

<span id="an_6:66">6:66</span> And he said: Therefore did I say to you,
that no man can come to me, unless it be given him by my Father.

<span id="an_6:67">6:67</span> After this many of his disciples went
back; and walked no more with him.

<span id="an_6:68">6:68</span> Then Jesus said to the twelve: Will you
also go away?

<span id="an_6:69">6:69</span> And Simon Peter answered him: Lord, to
whom shall we go? thou hast the words of eternal life.

<span id="an_6:70">6:70</span> And we have believed and have known, that
thou art the Christ, the Son of God.

<span id="an_6:71">6:71</span> Jesus answered them: Have not I chosen
you twelve; and one of you is a devil?

<span id="an_6:72">6:72</span> Now he meant Judas Iscariot, the son of
Simon: for this same was about to betray him, whereas he was one of the
twelve.

<span id="an_7:1">7:1</span> AFTER these things Jesus walked in Galilee;
for he would not walk in Judea, because the Jews sought to kill him.

<span id="an_7:2">7:2</span> Now the Jews' feast of tabernacles was at
hand.

<span id="an_7:3">7:3</span> And his brethren said to him: Pass from
hence, and go into Judea; that thy disciples also may see thy works
which thou dost.

<span id="an_7:4">7:4</span> For there is no man that doth any thing in
secret, and he himself seeketh to be known openly. If thou do these
things, manifest thyself to the world.

<span id="an_7:5">7:5</span> For neither did his brethren believe in
him.

<span id="an_7:6">7:6</span> Then Jesus said to them: My time is not yet
come; but your time is always ready.

<span id="an_7:7">7:7</span> The world cannot hate you; but me it
hateth: because I give testimony of it, that the works thereof are evil.

<span id="an_7:8">7:8</span> Go you up to this festival day, but I go
not up to this festival day: because my time is not accomplished.

<span id="an_7:9">7:9</span> When he had said these things, he himself
stayed in Galilee.

<span id="an_7:10">7:10</span> But after his brethren were gone up, then
he also went up to the feast, not openly, but, as it were, in secret.

<span id="an_7:11">7:11</span> The Jews therefore sought him on the
festival day, and said: Where is he?

<span id="an_7:12">7:12</span> And there was much murmuring among the
multitude concerning him. For some said: He is a good man. And others
said: No, but he seduceth the people.

<span id="an_7:13">7:13</span> Yet no man spoke openly of him, for fear
of the Jews.

<span id="an_7:14">7:14</span> Now about the midst of the feast, Jesus
went up into the temple, and taught.

<span id="an_7:15">7:15</span> And the Jews wondered, saying: How doth
this man know letters, having never learned?

<span id="an_7:16">7:16</span> Jesus answered them, and said: My
doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me.

<span id="an_7:17">7:17</span> If any man do the will of him; he shall
know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of
myself.

<span id="an_7:18">7:18</span> He that speaketh of himself, seeketh his
own glory: but he that seeketh the glory of him that sent him, he is
true, and there is no injustice in him.

<span id="an_7:19">7:19</span> Did Moses not give you the law, and yet
none of you keepeth the law?

<span id="an_7:20">7:20</span> Why seek you to kill me? The multitude
answered, and said: Thou hast a devil; who seeketh to kill thee?

<span id="an_7:21">7:21</span> Jesus answered, and said to them: One
work I have done; and you all wonder:

<span id="an_7:22">7:22</span> Therefore, Moses gave you circumcision
(not because it is of Moses, but of the fathers;) and on the sabbath day
you circumcise a man.

<span id="an_7:23">7:23</span> If a man receive circumcision on the
sabbath day, that the law of Moses may not be broken; are you angry at
me because I have healed the whole man on the sabbath day?

<span id="an_7:24">7:24</span> Judge not according to the appearance,
but judge just judgment.

<span id="an_7:25">7:25</span> Some therefore of Jerusalem said: Is not
this he whom they seek to kill?

<span id="an_7:26">7:26</span> And behold, he speaketh openly, and they
say nothing to him. Have the rulers known for a truth, that this is the
Christ?

<span id="an_7:27">7:27</span> But we know this man, whence he is: but
when the Christ cometh, no man knoweth whence he is.

<span id="an_7:28">7:28</span> Jesus therefore cried out in the temple,
teaching, and saying: You both know me, and you know whence I am: and I
am not come of myself; but he that sent me, is true, whom you know not.

<span id="an_7:29">7:29</span> I know him, because I am from him, and he
hath sent me.

<span id="an_7:30">7:30</span> They sought therefore to apprehend him:
and no man laid hands on him, because his hour was not yet come.

<span id="an_7:31">7:31</span> But of the people many believed in him,
and said: When the Christ cometh, shall he do more miracles, than these
which this man doth?

<span id="an_7:32">7:32</span> The Pharisees heard the people murmuring
these things concerning him: and the rulers and Pharisees sent ministers
to apprehend him.

<span id="an_7:33">7:33</span> Jesus therefore said to them: Yet a
little while I am with you: and then I go to him that sent me.

<span id="an_7:34">7:34</span> You shall seek me, and shall not find me:
and where I am, thither you cannot come.

<span id="an_7:35">7:35</span> The Jews therefore said among themselves:
Whither will he go, that we shall not find him? will he go unto the
dispersed among the Gentiles, and teach the Gentiles?

<span id="an_7:36">7:36</span> What is this saying that he hath said:
You shall seek me, and shall not find me; and where I am, you cannot
come?

<span id="an_7:37">7:37</span> And on the last, and great day of the
festivity, Jesus stood and cried, saying: If any man thirst, let him
come to me, and drink.

<span id="an_7:38">7:38</span> He that believeth in me, as the scripture
saith, Out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.

<span id="an_7:39">7:39</span> Now this he said of the Spirit which they
should receive, who believed in him: for as yet the Spirit was not
given, because Jesus was not yet glorified.

<span id="an_7:40">7:40</span> Of that multitude therefore, when they
had heard these words of his, some said: This is the prophet indeed.

<span id="an_7:41">7:41</span> Others said: This is the Christ. But some
said: Doth the Christ come out of Galilee?

<span id="an_7:42">7:42</span> Doth not the scripture say: That Christ
cometh of the seed of David, and from Bethlehem the town where David
was?

<span id="an_7:43">7:43</span> So there arose a dissension among the
people because of him.

<span id="an_7:44">7:44</span> And some of them would have apprehended
him: but no man laid hands on him.

<span id="an_7:45">7:45</span> The ministers therefore came to the chief
priests and the Pharisees. And they said to them: Why have you not
brought him?

<span id="an_7:46">7:46</span> The ministers answered: Never did man
speak like this man.

<span id="an_7:47">7:47</span> The Pharisees therefore answered them:
Are you also seduced?

<span id="an_7:48">7:48</span> Hath any one of the rulers believed in
him, or of the Pharisees?

<span id="an_7:49">7:49</span> But this multitude, that knoweth not the
law, are accursed.

<span id="an_7:50">7:50</span> Nicodemus said to them, (he that came to
him by night, who was one of them:)

<span id="an_7:51">7:51</span> Doth our law judge any man, unless it
first hear him, and know what he doth?

<span id="an_7:52">7:52</span> They answered, and said to him: Art thou
also a Galilean? Search the scriptures, and see, that out of Galilee a
prophet riseth not.

<span id="an_7:53">7:53</span> And every man returned to his own house.

<span id="an_8:1">8:1</span> AND Jesus went unto mount Olivet.

<span id="an_8:2">8:2</span> And early in the morning he came again into
the temple, and all the people came to him, and sitting down he taught
them.

<span id="an_8:3">8:3</span> And the scribes and the Pharisees bring
unto him a woman taken in adultery: and they set her in the midst,

<span id="an_8:4">8:4</span> And said to him: Master, this woman was
even now taken in adultery.

<span id="an_8:5">8:5</span> Now Moses in the law commanded us to stone
such a one. But what sayest thou?

<span id="an_8:6">8:6</span> And this they said tempting him, that they
might accuse him. But Jesus bowing himself down, wrote with his finger
on the ground.

<span id="an_8:7">8:7</span> When therefore they continued asking him,
he lifted up himself, and said to them: He that is without sin among
you, let him first cast a stone at her.

<span id="an_8:8">8:8</span> And again stooping down, he wrote on the
ground.

<span id="an_8:9">8:9</span> But they hearing this, went out one by one,
beginning at the eldest. And Jesus alone remained, and the woman
standing in the midst.

<span id="an_8:10">8:10</span> Then Jesus lifting up himself, said to
her: Woman, where are they that accused thee? Hath no man condemned
thee?

<span id="an_8:11">8:11</span> Who said: No man, Lord. And Jesus said:
Neither will I condemn thee. Go, and now sin no more.

<span id="an_8:12">8:12</span> Again therefore, Jesus spoke to them,
saying: I am the light of the world: he that followeth me, walketh not
in darkness, but shall have the light of life.

<span id="an_8:13">8:13</span> The Pharisees therefore said to him: Thou
givest testimony of thyself: thy testimony is not true.

<span id="an_8:14">8:14</span> Jesus answered, and said to them:
Although I give testimony of myself, my testimony is true: for I know
whence I came, and whither I go: but you know not whence I come, or
whither I go.

<span id="an_8:15">8:15</span> You judge according to the flesh: I judge
not any man.

<span id="an_8:16">8:16</span> And if I do judge, my judgment is true:
because I am not alone, but I and the Father that sent me.

<span id="an_8:17">8:17</span> And in your law it is written, that the
testimony of two men is true.

<span id="an_8:18">8:18</span> I am one that give testimony of myself:
and the Father that sent me giveth testimony of me.

<span id="an_8:19">8:19</span> They said therefore to him: Where is thy
Father? Jesus answered: Neither me do you know, nor my Father: if you
did know me, perhaps you would know my Father also.

<span id="an_8:20">8:20</span> These words Jesus spoke in the treasury,
teaching in the temple: and no man laid hands on him, because his hour
was not yet come.

<span id="an_8:21">8:21</span> Again therefore Jesus said to them: I go,
and you shall seek me, and you shall die in your sin. Whither I go, you
cannot come.

<span id="an_8:22">8:22</span> The Jews therefore said: Will he kill
himself, because he said: Whither I go, you cannot come?

<span id="an_8:23">8:23</span> And he said to them: You are from
beneath, I am from above. You are of this world, I am not of this world.

<span id="an_8:24">8:24</span> Therefore I said to you, that you shall
die in your sins. For if you believe not that I am he, you shall die in
your sin.

<span id="an_8:25">8:25</span> They said therefore to him: Who art thou?
Jesus said to them: The beginning, who also speak unto you.

<span id="an_8:26">8:26</span> Many things I have to speak and to judge
of you. But he that sent me, is true: and the things I have heard of
him, these same I speak in the world.

<span id="an_8:27">8:27</span> And they understood not, that he called
God his Father.

<span id="an_8:28">8:28</span> Jesus therefore said to them: When you
shall have lifted up the Son of man, then shall you know, that I am he,
and that I do nothing of myself, but as the Father hath taught me, these
things I speak:

<span id="an_8:29">8:29</span> And he that sent me, is with me, and he
hath not left me alone: for I do always the things that please him.

<span id="an_8:30">8:30</span> When he spoke these things, many believed
in him.

<span id="an_8:31">8:31</span> Then Jesus said to those Jews, who
believed him: If you continue in my word, you shall be my disciples
indeed.

<span id="an_8:32">8:32</span> And you shall know the truth, and the
truth shall make you free.

<span id="an_8:33">8:33</span> They answered him: We are the seed of
Abraham, and we have never been slaves to any man: how sayest thou: you
shall be free?

<span id="an_8:34">8:34</span> Jesus answered them: Amen, amen I say
unto you: that whosoever committeth sin, is the servant of sin.

<span id="an_8:35">8:35</span> Now the servant abideth not in the house
for ever; but the son abideth for ever.

<span id="an_8:36">8:36</span> If therefore the son shall make you free,
you shall be free indeed.

<span id="an_8:37">8:37</span> I know that you are the children of
Abraham: but you seek to kill me, because my word hath no place in you.

<span id="an_8:38">8:38</span> I speak that which I have seen with my
Father: and you do the things that you have seen with your father.

<span id="an_8:39">8:39</span> They answered, and said to him: Abraham
is our father. Jesus saith to them: If you be the children of Abraham,
do the works of Abraham.

<span id="an_8:40">8:40</span> But now you seek to kill me, a man who
have spoken the truth to you, which I have heard of God. This Abraham
did not.

<span id="an_8:41">8:41</span> You do the works of your father. They
said therefore to him: We are not born of fornication: we have one
Father, even God.

<span id="an_8:42">8:42</span> Jesus therefore said to them: If God were
your Father, you would indeed love me. For from God I proceeded, and
came; for I came not of myself, but he sent me:

<span id="an_8:43">8:43</span> Why do you not know my speech? Because
you cannot hear my word.

<span id="an_8:44">8:44</span> You are of your father the devil, and the
desires of your father you will do. He was a murderer from the
beginning, and he stood not in the truth; because truth is not in him.
When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and
the father thereof.

<span id="an_8:45">8:45</span> But if I say the truth, you believe me
not.

<span id="an_8:46">8:46</span> Which of you shall convince me of sin? If
I say the truth to you, why do you not believe me?

<span id="an_8:47">8:47</span> He that is of God, heareth the words of
God. Therefore you hear them not, because you are not of God.

<span id="an_8:48">8:48</span> The Jews therefore answered, and said to
him: Do not we say well that thou art a Samaritan, and hast a devil?

<span id="an_8:49">8:49</span> Jesus answered: I have not a devil: but I
honour my Father, and you have dishonoured me.

<span id="an_8:50">8:50</span> But I seek not my own glory: there is one
that seeketh and judgeth.

<span id="an_8:51">8:51</span> Amen, amen I say to you: If any man keep
my word, he shall not see death for ever.

<span id="an_8:52">8:52</span> The Jews therefore said: Now we know that
thou hast a devil. Abraham is dead, and the prophets; and thou sayest:
If any man keep my word, he shall not taste death for ever.

<span id="an_8:53">8:53</span> Art thou greater than our father Abraham,
who is dead? and the prophets are dead. Whom dost thou make thyself?

<span id="an_8:54">8:54</span> Jesus answered: If I glorify myself, my
glory is nothing. It is my Father that glorifieth me, of whom you say
that he is your God.

<span id="an_8:55">8:55</span> And you have not known him, but I know
him. And if I shall say that I know him not, I shall be like to you, a
liar. But I do know him, and do keep his word.

<span id="an_8:56">8:56</span> Abraham your father rejoiced that he
might see my day: he saw it, and was glad.

<span id="an_8:57">8:57</span> The Jews therefore said to him: Thou art
not yet fifty years old, and hast thou seen Abraham?

<span id="an_8:58">8:58</span> Jesus said to them: Amen, amen I say to
you, before Abraham was made, I am.

<span id="an_8:59">8:59</span> They took up stones therefore to cast at
him. But Jesus hid himself, and went out of the temple.

<span id="an_9:1">9:1</span> AND Jesus passing by, saw a man, who was
blind from his birth:

<span id="an_9:2">9:2</span> And his disciples asked him: Rabbi, who
hath sinned, this man, or his parents, that he should be born blind?

<span id="an_9:3">9:3</span> Jesus answered: Neither hath this man
sinned, nor his parents; but that the works of God should be made
manifest in him.

<span id="an_9:4">9:4</span> I must work the works of him that sent me,
whilst it is day: the night cometh, when no man can work.

<span id="an_9:5">9:5</span> As long as I am in the world, I am the
light of the world.

<span id="an_9:6">9:6</span> When he had said these things, he spat on
the ground, and made clay of the spittle, and spread the clay on his
eyes,

<span id="an_9:7">9:7</span> And said to him: Go, wash in the pool of
Siloe, which is interpreted, Sent. He went therefore, and washed, and he
came seeing.

<span id="an_9:8">9:8</span> The neighbours therefore, and they who had
seen him before that he was a beggar, said: Is not this he that sat and
begged? Some said: This is he.

<span id="an_9:9">9:9</span> But others said: No, but he is like him.
But he said: I am he.

<span id="an_9:10">9:10</span> They said therefore to him: How were thy
eyes opened?

<span id="an_9:11">9:11</span> He answered: That man that is called
Jesus made clay, and anointed my eyes, and said to me: Go to the pool of
Siloe, and wash. And I went, I washed, and I see.

<span id="an_9:12">9:12</span> And they said to him: Where is he? He
saith: I know not.

<span id="an_9:13">9:13</span> They bring him that had been blind to the
Pharisees.

<span id="an_9:14">9:14</span> Now it was the sabbath, when Jesus made
the clay, and opened his eyes.

<span id="an_9:15">9:15</span> Again therefore the Pharisees asked him,
how he had received his sight. But he said to them: He put clay upon my
eyes, and I washed, and I see.

<span id="an_9:16">9:16</span> Some therefore of the Pharisees said:
This man is not of God, who keepeth not the sabbath. But others said:
How can a man that is a sinner do such miracles? And there was a
division among them.

<span id="an_9:17">9:17</span> They say therefore to the blind man
again: What sayest thou of him that hath opened they eyes? And he said:
He is a prophet.

<span id="an_9:18">9:18</span> The Jews then did not believe concerning
him, that he had been blind, and had received his sight, until they
called the parents of him that had received his sight,

<span id="an_9:19">9:19</span> And asked them, saying: Is this your son,
who you say was born blind? How then doth he now see?

<span id="an_9:20">9:20</span> His parents answered them, and said: We
know that this is our son, and that he was born blind:

<span id="an_9:21">9:21</span> But how he now seeth, we know not; or who
hath opened his eyes, we know not: ask himself: he is of age, let him
speak for himself.

<span id="an_9:22">9:22</span> These things his parents said, because
they feared the Jews: for the Jews had already agreed among themselves,
that if any man should confess him to be Christ, he should be put out of
the synagogue.

<span id="an_9:23">9:23</span> Therefore did his parents say: He is of
age, ask himself.

<span id="an_9:24">9:24</span> They therefore called the man again that
had been blind, and said to him: Give glory to God. We know that this
man is a sinner.

<span id="an_9:25">9:25</span> He said therefore to them: If he be a
sinner, I know not: one thing I know, that whereas I was blind, now I
see.

<span id="an_9:26">9:26</span> They said then to him: What did he to
thee? How did he open thy eyes?

<span id="an_9:27">9:27</span> He answered them: I have told you
already, and you have heard: why would you hear it again? will you also
become his disciples?

<span id="an_9:28">9:28</span> They reviled him therefore, and said: Be
thou his disciple; but we are the disciples of Moses.

<span id="an_9:29">9:29</span> We know that God spoke to Moses: but as
to this man, we know not from whence he is.

<span id="an_9:30">9:30</span> The man answered, and said to them: Why,
herein is a wonderful thing, that you know not from whence he is, and he
hath opened my eyes.

<span id="an_9:31">9:31</span> Now we know that God doth not hear
sinners: but if a man be a server of God, and doth his will, him he
heareth.

<span id="an_9:32">9:32</span> From the beginning of the world it hath
not been heard, that any man hath opened the eyes of one born blind.

<span id="an_9:33">9:33</span> Unless this man were of God, he could not
do any thing.

<span id="an_9:34">9:34</span> They answered, and said to him: Thou wast
wholly born in sins, and dost thou teach us? And they cast him out.

<span id="an_9:35">9:35</span> Jesus heard that they had cast him out:
and when he had found him, he said to him: Dost thou believe in the Son
of God?

<span id="an_9:36">9:36</span> He answered, and said: Who is he, Lord,
that I may believe in him?

<span id="an_9:37">9:37</span> And Jesus said to him: Thou hast both
seen him; and it is he that talketh with thee.

<span id="an_9:38">9:38</span> And he said: I believe, Lord. And falling
down, he adored him.

<span id="an_9:39">9:39</span> And Jesus said: For judgment I am come
into this world; that they who see not, may see; and they who see, may
become blind.

<span id="an_9:40">9:40</span> And some of the Pharisees, who were with
him, heard: and they said unto him: Are we also blind?

<span id="an_9:41">9:41</span> Jesus said to them: If you were blind,
you should not have sin: but now you say: We see. Your sin remaineth.

<span id="an_10:1">10:1</span> AMEN, amen I say to you: He that entereth
not by the door into the sheepfold, but climbeth up another way, the
same is a thief and a robber.

<span id="an_10:2">10:2</span> But he that entereth in by the door is
the shepherd of the sheep.

<span id="an_10:3">10:3</span> To him the porter openeth; and the sheep
hear his voice: and he calleth his own sheep by name, and leadeth them
out.

<span id="an_10:4">10:4</span> And when he hath let out his own sheep,
he goeth before them: and the sheep follow him, because they know his
voice.

<span id="an_10:5">10:5</span> But a stranger they follow not, but fly
from him, because they know not the voice of strangers.

<span id="an_10:6">10:6</span> This proverb Jesus spoke to them. But
they understood not what he spoke to them.

<span id="an_10:7">10:7</span> Jesus therefore said to them again: Amen,
amen I say to you, I am the door of the sheep.

<span id="an_10:8">10:8</span> All others, as many as have come, are
thieves and robbers: and the sheep heard them not.

<span id="an_10:9">10:9</span> I am the door. By me, if any man enter
in, he shall be saved: and he shall go in, and go out, and shall find
pastures.

<span id="an_10:10">10:10</span> The thief cometh not, but for to steal,
and to kill, and to destroy. I am come that they may have life, and may
have it more abundantly.

<span id="an_10:11">10:11</span> I am the good shepherd. The good
shepherd giveth his life for his sheep.

<span id="an_10:12">10:12</span> But the hireling, and he that is not
the shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, seeth the wolf coming, and
leaveth the sheep, and flieth: and the wolf catcheth, and scattereth the
sheep:

<span id="an_10:13">10:13</span> And the hireling flieth, because he is
a hireling: and he hath no care for the sheep.

<span id="an_10:14">10:14</span> I am the good shepherd; and I know
mine, and mine know me.

<span id="an_10:15">10:15</span> As the Father knoweth me, and I know
the Father: and I lay down my life for my sheep.

<span id="an_10:16">10:16</span> And other sheep I have, that are not of
this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice, and
there shall be one fold and one shepherd.

<span id="an_10:17">10:17</span> Therefore doth the Father love me:
because I lay down my life, that I may take it again.

<span id="an_10:18">10:18</span> No man taketh it away from me: but I
lay it down of myself, and I have power to lay it down: and I have power
to take it up again. This commandment have I received of my Father.

<span id="an_10:19">10:19</span> A dissension rose again among the Jews
for these words.

<span id="an_10:20">10:20</span> And many of them said: He hath a devil,
and is mad: why hear you him?

<span id="an_10:21">10:21</span> Others said: These are not the words of
one that hath a devil: Can a devil open the eyes of the blind?

<span id="an_10:22">10:22</span> And it was the feast of the dedication
at Jerusalem: and it was winter.

<span id="an_10:23">10:23</span> And Jesus walked in the temple, in
Solomon's porch.

<span id="an_10:24">10:24</span> The Jews therefore came round about
him, and said to him: How long dost thou hold our souls in suspense? If
thou be the Christ, tell us plainly.

<span id="an_10:25">10:25</span> Jesus answered them: I speak to you,
and you believe not: the works that I do in the name of my Father, they
give testimony of me.

<span id="an_10:26">10:26</span> But you do not believe, because you are
not of my sheep.

<span id="an_10:27">10:27</span> My sheep hear my voice: and I know
them, and they follow me.

<span id="an_10:28">10:28</span> And I give them life everlasting; and
they shall not perish for ever, and no man shall pluck them out of my
hand.

<span id="an_10:29">10:29</span> That which my Father hath given me, is
greater than all: and no one can snatch them out of the hand of my
Father.

<span id="an_10:30">10:30</span> I and the Father are one.

<span id="an_10:31">10:31</span> The Jews then took up stones to stone
him.

<span id="an_10:32">10:32</span> Jesus answered them: Many good works I
have shewed you from my Father; for which of these works do you stone
me?

<span id="an_10:33">10:33</span> The Jews answered him: For a good work
we stone thee not, but for blasphemy; and because that thou, being a
man, maketh thyself God.

<span id="an_10:34">10:34</span> Jesus answered them: Is it not written
in your law: I said you are gods?

<span id="an_10:35">10:35</span> If he called them gods, to whom to word
of God was spoken, and the scripture cannot be broken;

<span id="an_10:36">10:36</span> Do you say of him whom the Father hath
sanctified and sent into the world: Thou blasphemest, because I said, I
am the Son of God?

<span id="an_10:37">10:37</span> If I do not the works of my Father,
believe me not.

<span id="an_10:38">10:38</span> But if I do, though you will not
believe me, believe the works: that you may know and believe that the
Father is in me, and I in the Father.

<span id="an_10:39">10:39</span> They sought therefore to take him; and
he escaped out of their hands.

<span id="an_10:40">10:40</span> And he went again beyond the Jordan,
into that place where John was baptizing first; and there he abode.

<span id="an_10:41">10:41</span> And many resorted to him, and they
said: John indeed did no sign.

<span id="an_10:42">10:42</span> But all things whatsoever John said of
this man, were true. And many believed in him.

<span id="an_11:1">11:1</span> NOW there was a certain man sick, named
Lazarus, of Bethania, of the town of Mary and Martha her sister.

<span id="an_11:2">11:2</span> (And Mary was she that anointed the Lord
with ointment, and wiped his feet with her hair: whose brother Lazarus
was sick.)

<span id="an_11:3">11:3</span> His sisters therefore sent to him,
saying: Lord, behold, he whom thou lovest is sick.

<span id="an_11:4">11:4</span> And Jesus hearing it, said to them: This
sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God: that the Son of
God may be glorified by it.

<span id="an_11:5">11:5</span> Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister
Mary, and Lazarus.

<span id="an_11:6">11:6</span> When he had heard therefore that he was
sick, he still remained in the same place two days.

<span id="an_11:7">11:7</span> Then after that, he said to his
disciples: Let us go into Judea again.

<span id="an_11:8">11:8</span> The disciples say to him: Rabbi, the Jews
but now sought to stone thee: and goest thou thither again?

<span id="an_11:9">11:9</span> Jesus answered: Are there not twelve
hours of the day? If a man walk in the day, he stumbleth not, because he
seeth the light of this world:

<span id="an_11:10">11:10</span> But if he walk in the night, he
stumbleth, because the light is not in him.

<span id="an_11:11">11:11</span> These things he said; and after that he
said to them: Lazarus our friend sleepeth; but I go that I may awake him
out of sleep.

<span id="an_11:12">11:12</span> His disciples therefore said: Lord, if
he sleep, he shall do well.

<span id="an_11:13">11:13</span> But Jesus spoke of his death; and they
thought that he spoke of the repose of sleep.

<span id="an_11:14">11:14</span> Then therefore Jesus said to them
plainly: Lazarus is dead.

<span id="an_11:15">11:15</span> And I am glad, for your sakes, that I
was not there, that you may believe: but let us go to him.

<span id="an_11:16">11:16</span> Thomas therefore, who is called
Didymus, said to his fellow disciples: Let us also go, that we may die
with him.

<span id="an_11:17">11:17</span> Jesus therefore came, and found that he
had been four days already in the grave.

<span id="an_11:18">11:18</span> (Now Bethania was near Jerusalem, about
fifteen furlongs off.)

<span id="an_11:19">11:19</span> And many of the Jews were come to
Martha and Mary, to comfort them concerning their brother.

<span id="an_11:20">11:20</span> Martha therefore, as soon as she heard
that Jesus had come, went to meet him: but Mary sat at home.

<span id="an_11:21">11:21</span> Martha therefore said to Jesus: Lord,
if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.

<span id="an_11:22">11:22</span> But now also I know that whatsoever
thou wilt ask of God, God will give it thee.

<span id="an_11:23">11:23</span> Jesus saith to her: Thy brother shall
rise again.

<span id="an_11:24">11:24</span> Martha saith to him: I know that he
shall rise again, in the resurrection at the last day.

<span id="an_11:25">11:25</span> Jesus said to her: I am the
resurrection and the life: he that believeth in me, although he be dead,
shall live:

<span id="an_11:26">11:26</span> And every one that liveth, and
believeth in me, shall not die for ever. Believest thou this?

<span id="an_11:27">11:27</span> She saith to him: Yea, Lord, I have
believed that thou art Christ the Son of the living God, who art come
into this world.

<span id="an_11:28">11:28</span> And when she had said these things, she
went, and called her sister Mary secretly, saying: The master is come,
and calleth for thee.

<span id="an_11:29">11:29</span> She, as soon as she heard this, riseth
quickly, and cometh to him.

<span id="an_11:30">11:30</span> For Jesus was not yet come into the
town: but he was still in that place where Martha had met him.

<span id="an_11:31">11:31</span> The Jews therefore, who were with her
in the house, and comforted her, when they saw Mary that she rose up
speedily and went out, followed her, saying: She goeth to the grave to
weep there.

<span id="an_11:32">11:32</span> When Mary therefore was come where
Jesus was, seeing him, she fell down at his feet, and saith to him:
Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.

<span id="an_11:33">11:33</span> Jesus, therefore, when he saw her
weeping, and the Jews that were come with her, weeping, groaned in the
spirit, and troubled himself,

<span id="an_11:34">11:34</span> And said: Where have you laid him? They
say to him: Lord, come and see.

<span id="an_11:35">11:35</span> And Jesus wept.

<span id="an_11:36">11:36</span> The Jews therefore said: Behold how he
loved him.

<span id="an_11:37">11:37</span> But some of them said: Could not he
that opened the eyes of the man born blind, have caused that this man
should not die?

<span id="an_11:38">11:38</span> Jesus therefore again groaning in
himself, cometh to the sepulchre. Now it was a cave; and a stone was
laid over it.

<span id="an_11:39">11:39</span> Jesus saith: Take away the stone.
Martha, the sister of him that was dead, saith to him: Lord, by this
time he stinketh, for he is now of four days.

<span id="an_11:40">11:40</span> Jesus saith to her: Did not I say to
thee, that if thou believe, thou shalt see the glory of God?

<span id="an_11:41">11:41</span> They took therefore the stone away. And
Jesus lifting up his eyes said: Father, I give thee thanks that thou
hast heard me.

<span id="an_11:42">11:42</span> And I knew that thou hearest me always;
but because of the people who stand about have I said it, that they may
believe that thou hast sent me.

<span id="an_11:43">11:43</span> When he had said these things, he cried
with a loud voice: Lazarus, come forth.

<span id="an_11:44">11:44</span> And presently he that had been dead
came forth, bound feet and hands with winding bands; and his face was
bound about with a napkin. Jesus said to them: Loose him, and let him
go.

<span id="an_11:45">11:45</span> Many therefore of the Jews, who were
come to Mary and Martha, and had seen the things that Jesus did,
believed in him.

<span id="an_11:46">11:46</span> But some of them went to the Pharisees,
and told them the things that Jesus had done.

<span id="an_11:47">11:47</span> The chief priests therefore, and the
Pharisees, gathered a council, and said: What do we, for this man doth
many miracles?

<span id="an_11:48">11:48</span> If we let him alone so, all will
believe in him; and the Romans will come, and take away our place and
nation.

<span id="an_11:49">11:49</span> But one of them, named Caiphas, being
the high priest that year, said to them: You know nothing.

<span id="an_11:50">11:50</span> Neither do you consider that it is
expedient for you that one man should die for the people, and that the
whole nation perish not.

<span id="an_11:51">11:51</span> And this he spoke not of himself: but
being the high priest of that year, he prophesied that Jesus should die
for the nation.

<span id="an_11:52">11:52</span> And not only for the nation, but to
gather together in one the children of God, that were dispersed.

<span id="an_11:53">11:53</span> From that day therefore they devised to
put him to death.

<span id="an_11:54">11:54</span> Wherefore Jesus walked no more openly
among the Jews; but he went into a country near the desert, unto a city
that is called Ephrem, and there he abode with his disciples.

<span id="an_11:55">11:55</span> And the pasch of the Jews was at hand;
and many from the country went up to Jerusalem, before the pasch to
purify themselves.

<span id="an_11:56">11:56</span> They sought therefore for Jesus; and
they discoursed one with another, standing in the temple: What think you
that he is not come to the festival day? And the chief priests and
Pharisees had given a commandment, that if any man knew where he was, he
should tell, that they might apprehend him.

<span id="an_12:1">12:1</span> JESUS therefore, six days before the
pasch, came to Bethania, where Lazarus had been dead, whom Jesus raised
to life.

<span id="an_12:2">12:2</span> And they made him a supper there: and
Martha served: but Lazarus was one of them that were at table with him.

<span id="an_12:3">12:3</span> Mary therefore took a pound of ointment
of right spikenard, of great price, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and
wiped his feet with her hair; and the house was filled with the odour of
the ointment.

<span id="an_12:4">12:4</span> Then one of his disciples, Judas
Iscariot, he that was about to betray him, said:

<span id="an_12:5">12:5</span> Why was not this ointment sold for three
hundred pence, and given to the poor?

<span id="an_12:6">12:6</span> Now he said this, not because he cared
for the poor; but because he was a thief, and having the purse, carried
the things that were put therein.

<span id="an_12:7">12:7</span> Jesus therefore said: Let her alone, that
she may keep it against the day of my burial.

<span id="an_12:8">12:8</span> For the poor you have always with you;
but me you have not always.

<span id="an_12:9">12:9</span> A great multitude therefore of the Jews
knew that he was there; and they came, not for Jesus' sake only, but
that they might see Lazarus, whom he had raised from the dead.

<span id="an_12:10">12:10</span> But the chief priests thought to kill
Lazarus also:

<span id="an_12:11">12:11</span> Because many of the Jews, by reason of
him, went away, and believed in Jesus.

<span id="an_12:12">12:12</span> And on the next day, a great multitude
that was to come to the festival day, when they had heard that Jesus was
coming to Jerusalem,

<span id="an_12:13">12:13</span> Took branches of palm trees, and went
forth to meet him, and cried: Hosanna, blessed is he that cometh in the
name of the Lord, the king of Israel.

<span id="an_12:14">12:14</span> And Jesus found a young ass, and sat
upon it, as it is written:

<span id="an_12:15">12:15</span> Fear not, daughter of Sion: behold, thy
king cometh, sitting on an ass's colt.

<span id="an_12:16">12:16</span> These things his disciples did not know
at the first; but when Jesus was glorified, then they remembered that
these things were written of him, and that they had done these things to
him.

<span id="an_12:17">12:17</span> The multitude therefore gave testimony,
which was with him, when he called Lazarus out of the grave, and raised
him from the dead.

<span id="an_12:18">12:18</span> For which reason also the people came
to meet him, because they heard that he had done this miracle.

<span id="an_12:19">12:19</span> The Pharisees therefore said among
themselves: Do you see that we prevail nothing? behold, the whole world
is gone after him.

<span id="an_12:20">12:20</span> Now there were certain Gentiles among
them, who came up to adore on the festival day.

<span id="an_12:21">12:21</span> These therefore came to Philip, who was
of Bethsaida of Galilee, and desired him, saying: Sir, we would see
Jesus.

<span id="an_12:22">12:22</span> Philip cometh, and telleth Andrew.
Again Andrew and Philip told Jesus.

<span id="an_12:23">12:23</span> But Jesus answered them, saying: The
hour is come, that the Son of man should be glorified.

<span id="an_12:24">12:24</span> Amen, amen I say to you, unless the
grain of wheat falling into the ground die,

<span id="an_12:25">12:25</span> Itself remaineth alone. But if it die,
it bringeth forth much fruit. He that loveth his life shall lose it; and
he that hateth his life in this world, keepeth it unto life eternal.

<span id="an_12:26">12:26</span> If any man minister to me, let him
follow me; and where I am, there also shall my minister be. If any man
minister to me, him will my Father honour.

<span id="an_12:27">12:27</span> Now is my soul troubled. And what shall
I say? Father, save me from this hour. But for this cause I came unto
this hour.

<span id="an_12:28">12:28</span> Father, glorify thy name. A voice
therefore came from heaven: I have both glorified it, and will glorify
it again.

<span id="an_12:29">12:29</span> The multitude therefore that stood and
heard, said that it thundered. Others said: An angel spoke to him.

<span id="an_12:30">12:30</span> Jesus answered, and said: This voice
came not because of me, but for your sakes.

<span id="an_12:31">12:31</span> Now is the judgment of the world: now
shall the prince of this world be cast out.

<span id="an_12:32">12:32</span> And I, if I be lifted up from the
earth, will draw all things to myself.

<span id="an_12:33">12:33</span> (Now this he said, signifying what
death he should die.)

<span id="an_12:34">12:34</span> The multitude answered him: We have
heard out of the law, that Christ abideth for ever; and how sayest thou:
The Son of man must be lifted up? Who is this Son of man?

<span id="an_12:35">12:35</span> Jesus therefore said to them: Yet a
little while, the light is among you. Walk whilst you have the light,
that the darkness overtake you not. And he that walketh in darkness,
knoweth not whither he goeth.

<span id="an_12:36">12:36</span> Whilst you have the light, believe in
the light, that you may be the children of light. These things Jesus
spoke; and he went away, and hid himself from them.

<span id="an_12:37">12:37</span> And whereas he had done so many
miracles before them, they believed not in him:

<span id="an_12:38">12:38</span> That the saying of Isaias the prophet
might be fulfilled, which he said: Lord, who hath believed our hearing?
and to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed?

<span id="an_12:39">12:39</span> Therefore they could not believe,
because Isaias said again:

<span id="an_12:40">12:40</span> He hath blinded their eyes, and
hardened their heart, that they should not see with their eyes, nor
understand with their heart, and be converted, and I should heal them.

<span id="an_12:41">12:41</span> These things said Isaias, when he saw
his glory, and spoke of him.

<span id="an_12:42">12:42</span> However, many of the chief men also
believed in him; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess him,
that they might not be cast out of the synagogue.

<span id="an_12:43">12:43</span> For they loved the glory of men more
than the glory of God.

<span id="an_12:44">12:44</span> But Jesus cried, and said: He that
believeth in me, doth not believe in me, but in him that sent me.

<span id="an_12:45">12:45</span> And he that seeth me, seeth him that
sent me.

<span id="an_12:46">12:46</span> I am come a light into the world; that
whosoever believeth in me, may not remain in darkness.

<span id="an_12:47">12:47</span> And if any man hear my words, and keep
them not, I do not judge him: for I came not to judge the world, but to
save the world.

<span id="an_12:48">12:48</span> He that despiseth me, and receiveth not
my words, hath one that judgeth him; the word that I have spoken, the
same shall judge him in the last day.

<span id="an_12:49">12:49</span> For I have not spoken of myself; but
the Father who sent me, he gave me commandment what I should say, and
what I should speak.

<span id="an_12:50">12:50</span> And I know that his commandment is life
everlasting. The things therefore that I speak, even as the Father said
unto me, so do I speak.

<span id="an_13:1">13:1</span> BEFORE the festival day of the pasch,
Jesus knowing that his hour was come, that he should pass out of this
world to the Father: having loved his own who were in the world, he
loved them unto the end.

<span id="an_13:2">13:2</span> And when supper was done, (the devil
having now put into the heart of Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon, to
betray him,)

<span id="an_13:3">13:3</span> Knowing that the Father had given him all
things into his hands, and that he came from God, and goeth to God;

<span id="an_13:4">13:4</span> He riseth from supper, and layeth aside
his garments, and having taken a towel, girded himself.

<span id="an_13:5">13:5</span> After that, he putteth water into a
basin, and began to wash the feet of the disciples, and to wipe them
with the towel wherewith he was girded.

<span id="an_13:6">13:6</span> He cometh therefore to Simon Peter. And
Peter saith to him: Lord, dost thou wash my feet?

<span id="an_13:7">13:7</span> Jesus answered, and said to him: What I
do thou knowest not now; but thou shalt know hereafter.

<span id="an_13:8">13:8</span> Peter saith to him: Thou shalt never wash
my feet. Jesus answered him: If I wash thee not, thou shalt have no part
with me.

<span id="an_13:9">13:9</span> Simon Peter saith to him: Lord, not only
my feet, but also my hands and my head.

<span id="an_13:10">13:10</span> Jesus saith to him: He that is washed,
needeth not but to wash his feet, but is clean wholly. And you are
clean, but not all.

<span id="an_13:11">13:11</span> For he knew who he was that would
betray him; therefore he said: You are not all clean.

<span id="an_13:12">13:12</span> Then after he had washed their feet,
and taken his garments, being set down again, he said to them: Know you
what I have done to you?

<span id="an_13:13">13:13</span> You call me Master, and Lord; and you
say well, for so I am.

<span id="an_13:14">13:14</span> If then I being your Lord and Master,
have washed your feet; you also ought to wash one another's feet.

<span id="an_13:15">13:15</span> For I have given you an example, that
as I have done to you, so you do also.

<span id="an_13:16">13:16</span> Amen, amen I say to you: The servant is
not greater than his lord; neither is the apostle greater than he that
sent him.

<span id="an_13:17">13:17</span> If you know these things, you shall be
blessed if you do them.

<span id="an_13:18">13:18</span> I speak not of you all: I know whom I
have chosen. But that the scripture may be fulfilled: He that eateth
bread with me, shall lift up his heel against me.

<span id="an_13:19">13:19</span> At present I tell you, before it come
to pass: that when it shall come to pass, you may believe that I am he.

<span id="an_13:20">13:20</span> Amen, amen I say to you, he that
receiveth whomsoever I send, receiveth me; and he that receiveth me,
receiveth him that sent me.

<span id="an_13:21">13:21</span> When Jesus had said these things, he
was troubled in spirit; and he testified, and said: Amen, amen I say to
you, one of you shall betray me.

<span id="an_13:22">13:22</span> The disciples therefore looked one upon
another, doubting of whom he spoke.

<span id="an_13:23">13:23</span> Now there was leaning on Jesus' bosom
one of his disciples, whom Jesus loved.

<span id="an_13:24">13:24</span> Simon Peter therefore beckoned to him,
and said to him: Who is it of whom he speaketh?

<span id="an_13:25">13:25</span> He therefore, leaning on the breast of
Jesus, saith to him: Lord, who is it?

<span id="an_13:26">13:26</span> Jesus answered: He it is to whom I
shall reach bread dipped. And when he had dipped the bread, he gave it
to Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon.

<span id="an_13:27">13:27</span> And after the morsel, Satan entered
into him. And Jesus said to him: That which thou dost, do quickly.

<span id="an_13:28">13:28</span> Now no man at the table knew to what
purpose he said this unto him.

<span id="an_13:29">13:29</span> For some thought, because Judas had the
purse, that Jesus had said to him: Buy those things which we have need
of for the festival day: or that he should give something to the poor.

<span id="an_13:30">13:30</span> He therefore having received the
morsel, went out immediately. And it was night.

<span id="an_13:31">13:31</span> When he therefore was gone out, Jesus
said: Now is the Son of man glorified, and God is glorified in him.

<span id="an_13:32">13:32</span> If God be glorified in him, God also
will glorify him in himself; and immediately will he glorify him.

<span id="an_13:33">13:33</span> Little children, yet a little while I
am with you. You shall seek me; and as I said to the Jews: Whither I go
you cannot come; so I say to you now.

<span id="an_13:34">13:34</span> A new commandment I give unto you: That
you love one another, as I have loved you, that you also love one
another.

<span id="an_13:35">13:35</span> By this shall all men know that you are
my disciples, if you have love one for another.

<span id="an_13:36">13:36</span> Simon Peter saith to him: Lord, whither
goest thou? Jesus answered: Whither I go, thou canst not follow me now;
but thou shalt follow hereafter.

<span id="an_13:37">13:37</span> Peter saith to him: Why cannot I follow
thee now? I will lay down my life for thee.

<span id="an_13:38">13:38</span> Jesus answered him: Wilt thou lay down
thy life for me? Amen, amen I say to thee, the cock shall not crow, till
thou deny me thrice.

<span id="an_14:1">14:1</span> LET not your heart be troubled. You
believe in God, believe also in me.

<span id="an_14:2">14:2</span> In my Father's house there are many
mansions. If not, I would have told you: because I go to prepare a place
for you.

<span id="an_14:3">14:3</span> And if I shall go, and prepare a place
for you, I will come again, and will take you to myself; that where I
am, you also may be.

<span id="an_14:4">14:4</span> And whither I go you know, and the way
you know.

<span id="an_14:5">14:5</span> Thomas saith to him: Lord, we know not
whither thou goest; and how can we know the way?

<span id="an_14:6">14:6</span> Jesus saith to him: I am the way, and the
truth, and the life. No man cometh to the Father, but by me.

<span id="an_14:7">14:7</span> If you had known me, you would without
doubt have known my Father also: and from henceforth you shall know him,
and you have seen him.

<span id="an_14:8">14:8</span> Philip saith to him: Lord, shew us the
Father, and it is enough for us.

<span id="an_14:9">14:9</span> Jesus saith to him: Have I been so long a
time with you; and have you not known me? Philip, he that seeth me seeth
the Father also. How sayest thou, Shew us the Father?

<span id="an_14:10">14:10</span> Do you not believe, that I am in the
Father, and the Father in me? The words that I speak to you, I speak not
of myself. But the Father who abideth in me, he doth the works.

<span id="an_14:11">14:11</span> Believe you not that I am in the
Father, and the Father in me?

<span id="an_14:12">14:12</span> Otherwise believe for the very works'
sake. Amen, amen I say to you, he that believeth in me, the works that I
do, he also shall do; and greater than these shall he do.

<span id="an_14:13">14:13</span> Because I go to the Father: and
whatsoever you shall ask the Father in my name, that will I do: that the
Father may be glorified in the Son.

<span id="an_14:14">14:14</span> If you shall ask me any thing in my
name, that I will do.

<span id="an_14:15">14:15</span> If you love me, keep my commandments.

<span id="an_14:16">14:16</span> And I will ask the Father, and he shall
give you another Paraclete, that he may abide with you for ever.

<span id="an_14:17">14:17</span> The spirit of truth, whom the world
cannot receive, because it seeth him not, nor knoweth him: but you shall
know him; because he shall abide with you, and shall be in you.

<span id="an_14:18">14:18</span> I will not leave you orphans, I will
come to you.

<span id="an_14:19">14:19</span> Yet a little while: and the world seeth
me no more. But you see me: because I live, and you shall live.

<span id="an_14:20">14:20</span> In that day you shall know, that I am
in my Father, and you in me, and I in you.

<span id="an_14:21">14:21</span> He that hath my commandments, and
keepeth them; he it is that loveth me. And he that loveth me, shall be
loved of my Father: and I will love him, and will manifest myself to
him.

<span id="an_14:22">14:22</span> Judas saith to him, not the Iscariot:
Lord, how is it, that thou wilt manifest thyself to us, and not to the
world?

<span id="an_14:23">14:23</span> Jesus answered, and said to him: If any
one love me, he will keep my word, and my Father will love him, and we
will come to him, and will make our abode with him.

<span id="an_14:24">14:24</span> He that loveth me not, keepeth not my
words. And the word which you have heard, is not mine; but the Father's
who sent me.

<span id="an_14:25">14:25</span> These things have I spoken to you,
abiding with you.

<span id="an_14:26">14:26</span> But the Paraclete, the Holy Ghost, whom
the Father will send in my name, he will teach you all things, and bring
all things to your mind, whatsoever I shall have said to you.

<span id="an_14:27">14:27</span> Peace I leave with you, my peace I give
unto you: not as the world giveth, do I give unto you. Let not your
heart be troubled, nor let it be afraid.

<span id="an_14:28">14:28</span> You have heard that I said to you: I go
away, and I come unto you. If you loved me, you would indeed be glad,
because I go to the Father: for the Father is greater than I.

<span id="an_14:29">14:29</span> And now I have told you before it comes
to pass: that when it shall come to pass, you may believe.

<span id="an_14:30">14:30</span> I will not now speak many things with
you. For the prince of this world cometh, and in me he hath not any
thing.

<span id="an_14:31">14:31</span> But that the world may know, that I
love the Father: and as the Father hath given me commandment, so do I:
Arise, let us go hence.

<span id="an_15:1">15:1</span> I AM the true vine; and my Father is the
husbandman.

<span id="an_15:2">15:2</span> Every branch in me, that beareth not
fruit, he will take away: and every one that beareth fruit, he will
purge it, that it may bring forth more fruit.

<span id="an_15:3">15:3</span> Now you are clean by reason of the word,
which I have spoken to you.

<span id="an_15:4">15:4</span> Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch
cannot bear fruit of itself, unless it abide in the vine, so neither can
you, unless you abide in me.

<span id="an_15:5">15:5</span> I am the vine; you the branches: he that
abideth in me, and I in him, the same beareth much fruit: for without me
you can do nothing.

<span id="an_15:6">15:6</span> If any one abide not in me, he shall be
cast forth as a branch, and shall wither, and they shall gather him up,
and cast him into the fire, and he burneth.

<span id="an_15:7">15:7</span> If you abide in me, and my words abide in
you, you shall ask whatever you will, and it shall be done unto you.

<span id="an_15:8">15:8</span> In this is my Father glorified; that you
bring forth very much fruit, and become my disciples.

<span id="an_15:9">15:9</span> As the Father hath loved me, I also have
loved you. Abide in my love.

<span id="an_15:10">15:10</span> If you keep my commandments, you shall
abide in my love; as I also have kept my Father's commandments, and do
abide in his love.

<span id="an_15:11">15:11</span> These things I have spoken to you, that
my joy may be in you, and your joy may be filled.

<span id="an_15:12">15:12</span> This is my commandment, that you love
one another, as I have loved you.

<span id="an_15:13">15:13</span> Greater love than this no man hath,
that a man lay down his life for his friends.

<span id="an_15:14">15:14</span> You are my friends, if you do the
things that I command you.

<span id="an_15:15">15:15</span> I will not now call you servants: for
the servant knoweth not what his lord doth. But I have called you
friends: because all things whatsoever I have heard of my Father, I have
made known to you.

<span id="an_15:16">15:16</span> You have not chosen me: but I have
chosen you; and have appointed you, that you should go, and should bring
forth fruit; and your fruit should remain: that whatsoever you shall ask
of the Father in my name, he may give it you.

<span id="an_15:17">15:17</span> These things I command you, that you
love one another.

<span id="an_15:18">15:18</span> If the world hate you, know ye, that it
hath hated me before you.

<span id="an_15:19">15:19</span> If you had been of the world, the world
would love its own: but because you are not of the world, but I have
chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you.

<span id="an_15:20">15:20</span> Remember my word that I said to you:
The servant is not greater than his master. If they have persecuted me,
they will also persecute you: if they have kept my word, they will keep
yours also.

<span id="an_15:21">15:21</span> But all these things they will do to
you for my name's sake: because they know not him who sent me.

<span id="an_15:22">15:22</span> If I had not come, and spoken to them,
they would not have sin; but now they have no excuse for their sin.

<span id="an_15:23">15:23</span> He that hateth me, hateth my Father
also.

<span id="an_15:24">15:24</span> If I had not done among them the works
that no other man hath done, they would not have sin; but now they have
both seen and hated both me and my Father.

<span id="an_15:25">15:25</span> But that the word may be fulfilled
which is written in their law: They hated me without cause.

<span id="an_15:26">15:26</span> But when the Paraclete cometh, whom I
will send you from the Father, the Spirit of truth, who proceedeth from
the Father, he shall give testimony of me.

<span id="an_15:27">15:27</span> And you shall give testimony, because
you are with me from the beginning.

<span id="an_16:1">16:1</span> THESE things have I spoken to you, that
you may not be scandalized.

<span id="an_16:2">16:2</span> They will put you out of the synagogues:
yea, the hour cometh, that whosoever killeth you, will think that he
doth a service to God.

<span id="an_16:3">16:3</span> And these things will they do to you;
because they have not known the Father, nor me.

<span id="an_16:4">16:4</span> But these things I have told you, that
when the hour shall come, you may remember that I told you of them.

<span id="an_16:5">16:5</span> But I told you not these things from the
beginning, because I was with you. And now I go to him that sent me, and
none of you asketh me: Whither goest thou?

<span id="an_16:6">16:6</span> But because I have spoken these things to
you, sorrow hath filled your heart.

<span id="an_16:7">16:7</span> But I tell you the truth: it is expedient
to you that I go: for if I go not, the Paraclete will not come to you;
but if I go, I will send him to you.

<span id="an_16:8">16:8</span> And when he is come, he will convince the
world of sin, and of justice, and of judgment.

<span id="an_16:9">16:9</span> Of sin: because they believed not in me.

<span id="an_16:10">16:10</span> And of justice: because I go to the
Father; and you shall see me no longer.

<span id="an_16:11">16:11</span> And of judgment: because the prince of
this world is already judged.

<span id="an_16:12">16:12</span> I have yet many things to say to you:
but you cannot bear them now.

<span id="an_16:13">16:13</span> But when he, the Spirit of truth, is
come, he will teach you all truth. For he shall not speak of himself;
but what things soever he shall hear, he shall speak; and the things
that are to come, he shall shew you.

<span id="an_16:14">16:14</span> He shall glorify me; because he shall
receive of mine, and shall shew it to you.

<span id="an_16:15">16:15</span> All things whatsoever the Father hath,
are mine. Therefore I said, that he shall receive of mine, and shew it
to you.

<span id="an_16:16">16:16</span> A little while, and now you shall not
see me; and again a little while, and you shall see me: because I go to
the Father.

<span id="an_16:17">16:17</span> Then some of the disciples said one to
another: What is this that he saith to us: A little while, and you shall
not see me; and again a little while, and you shall see me, and, because
I go to the Father?

<span id="an_16:18">16:18</span> They said therefore: What is this that
he saith, A little while? we know not what he speaketh.

<span id="an_16:19">16:19</span> And Jesus knew that they had a mind to
ask him; and he said to them: Of this do you inquire among yourselves,
because I said: A little while, and you shall not see me; and again a
little while, and you shall see me?

<span id="an_16:20">16:20</span> Amen, amen I say to you, that you shall
lament and weep, but the world shall rejoice; and you shall be made
sorrowful, but your sorrow shall be turned into joy.

<span id="an_16:21">16:21</span> A woman, when she is in labour, hath
sorrow, because her hour is come; but when she hath brought forth the
child, she remembereth no more the anguish, for joy that a man is born
into the world.

<span id="an_16:22">16:22</span> So also you now indeed have sorrow; but
I will see you again, and your heart shall rejoice; and your joy no man
shall take from you.

<span id="an_16:23">16:23</span> And in that day you shall not ask me
any thing. Amen, amen I say to you: if you ask the Father any thing in
my name, he will give it you.

<span id="an_16:24">16:24</span> Hitherto you have not asked any thing
in my name. Ask, and you shall receive; that your joy may be full.

<span id="an_16:25">16:25</span> These things I have spoken to you in
proverbs. The hour cometh, when I will no more speak to you in proverbs,
but will shew you plainly of the Father.

<span id="an_16:26">16:26</span> In that day you shall ask in my name;
and I say not to you, that I will ask the Father for you:

<span id="an_16:27">16:27</span> For the Father himself loveth you,
because you have loved me, and have believed that I came out from God.

<span id="an_16:28">16:28</span> I came forth from the Father, and am
come into the world: again I leave the world, and I go to the Father.

<span id="an_16:29">16:29</span> His disciples say to him: Behold, now
thou speakest plainly, and speakest no proverb.

<span id="an_16:30">16:30</span> Now we know that thou knowest all
things, and thou needest not that any man should ask thee. By this we
believe that thou camest forth from God.

<span id="an_16:31">16:31</span> Jesus answered them: Do you now
believe?

<span id="an_16:32">16:32</span> Behold, the hour cometh, and it is now
come, that you shall be scattered every man to his own, and shall leave
me alone; and yet I am not alone, because the Father is with me.

<span id="an_16:33">16:33</span> These things I have spoken to you, that
in me you may have peace. In the world you shall have distress: but have
confidence, I have overcome the world.

<span id="an_17:1">17:1</span> THESE things Jesus spoke, and lifting up
his eyes to heaven, he said: Father, the hour is come, glorify thy Son,
that thy Son may glorify thee.

<span id="an_17:2">17:2</span> As thou hast given him power over all
flesh, that he may give eternal life to all whom thou hast given him.

<span id="an_17:3">17:3</span> Now this is eternal life: That they may
know thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.

<span id="an_17:4">17:4</span> I have glorified thee on the earth; I
have finished the work which thou gavest me to do.

<span id="an_17:5">17:5</span> And now glorify thou me, O Father, with
thyself, with the glory which I had, before the world was, with thee.

<span id="an_17:6">17:6</span> I have manifested thy name to the men
whom thou hast given me out of the world. Thine they were, and to me
thou gavest them; and they have kept thy word.

<span id="an_17:7">17:7</span> Now they have known, that all things
which thou hast given me, are from thee:

<span id="an_17:8">17:8</span> Because the words which thou gavest me, I
have given to them; and they have received them, and have known in very
deed that I came out from thee, and they have believed that thou didst
send me.

<span id="an_17:9">17:9</span> I pray for them: I pray not for the
world, but for them whom thou hast given me: because they are thine:

<span id="an_17:10">17:10</span> And all my things are thine, and thine
are mine; and I am glorified in them.

<span id="an_17:11">17:11</span> And now I am not in the world, and
these are in the world, and I come to thee. Holy Father, keep them in
thy name whom thou has given me; that they may be one, as we also are.

<span id="an_17:12">17:12</span> While I was with them, I kept them in
thy name. Those whom thou gavest me have I kept; and none of them is
lost, but the son of perdition, that the scripture may be fulfilled.

<span id="an_17:13">17:13</span> And now I come to thee; and these
things I speak in the world, that they may have my joy filled in
themselves.

<span id="an_17:14">17:14</span> I have given them thy word, and the
world hath hated them, because they are not of the world; as I also am
not of the world.

<span id="an_17:15">17:15</span> I pray not that thou shouldst take them
out of the world, but that thou shouldst keep them from evil.

<span id="an_17:16">17:16</span> They are not of the world, as I also am
not of the world.

<span id="an_17:17">17:17</span> Sanctify them in truth. Thy word is
truth.

<span id="an_17:18">17:18</span> As thou hast sent me into the world, I
also have sent them into the world.

<span id="an_17:19">17:19</span> And for them do I sanctify myself, that
they also may be sanctified in truth.

<span id="an_17:20">17:20</span> And not for them only do I pray, but
for them also who through their word shall believe in me;

<span id="an_17:21">17:21</span> That they all may be one, as thou,
Father, in me, and I in thee; that they also may be one in us; that the
world may believe that thou hast sent me.

<span id="an_17:22">17:22</span> And the glory which thou hast given me,
I have given to them; that they may be one, as we also are one:

<span id="an_17:23">17:23</span> I in them, and thou in me; that they
may be made perfect in one: and the world may know that thou hast sent
me, and hast loved them, as thou hast also loved me.

<span id="an_17:24">17:24</span> Father, I will that where I am, they
also whom thou hast given me may be with me; that they may see my glory
which thou hast given me, because thou hast loved me before the creation
of the world.

<span id="an_17:25">17:25</span> Just Father, the world hath not known
thee; but I have known thee: and these have known that thou hast sent
me.

<span id="an_17:26">17:26</span> And I have made known thy name to them,
and will make it known; that the love wherewith thou hast loved me, may
be in them, and I in them.

<span id="an_18:1">18:1</span> WHEN Jesus had said these things, he went
forth with his disciples over the brook Cedron, where there was a
garden, into which he entered with his disciples.

<span id="an_18:2">18:2</span> And Judas also, who betrayed him, knew
the place; because Jesus had often resorted thither together with his
disciples.

<span id="an_18:3">18:3</span> Judas therefore having received a band of
soldiers and servants from the chief priests and the Pharisees, cometh
thither with lanterns and torches and weapons.

<span id="an_18:4">18:4</span> Jesus therefore, knowing all things that
should come upon him, went forth, and said to them: Whom seek ye?

<span id="an_18:5">18:5</span> They answered him: Jesus of Nazareth.
Jesus saith to them: I am he. And Judas also, who betrayed him, stood
with them.

<span id="an_18:6">18:6</span> As soon therefore as he had said to them:
I am he; they went backward, and fell to the ground.

<span id="an_18:7">18:7</span> Again therefore he asked them: Whom seek
ye? And they said, Jesus of Nazareth.

<span id="an_18:8">18:8</span> Jesus answered, I have told you that I am
he. If therefore you seek me, let these go their way.

<span id="an_18:9">18:9</span> That the word might be fulfilled which he
said: Of them whom thou hast given me, I have not lost any one.

<span id="an_18:10">18:10</span> Then Simon Peter, having a sword, drew
it, and struck the servant of the high priest, and cut off his right
ear. And the name of the servant was Malchus.

<span id="an_18:11">18:11</span> Jesus therefore said to Peter: Put up
thy sword into the scabbard. The chalice which my Father hath given me,
shall I not drink it?

<span id="an_18:12">18:12</span> Then the band and the tribune, and the
servants of the Jews, took Jesus, and bound him:

<span id="an_18:13">18:13</span> And they led him away to Annas first,
for he was father in law to Caiphas, who was the high priest of that
year.

<span id="an_18:14">18:14</span> Now Caiphas was he who had given the
counsel to the Jews: That it was expedient that one man should die for
the people.

<span id="an_18:15">18:15</span> And Simon Peter followed Jesus, and so
did another disciple. And that disciple was known to the high priest,
and went in with Jesus into the court of the high priest.

<span id="an_18:16">18:16</span> But Peter stood at the door without.
The other disciple therefore, who was known to the high priest, went
out, and spoke to the portress, and brought in Peter.

<span id="an_18:17">18:17</span> The maid therefore that was portress,
saith to Peter: Art not thou also one of this man's disciples? He saith:
I am not.

<span id="an_18:18">18:18</span> Now the servants and ministers stood at
a fire of coals, because it was cold, and warmed themselves. And with
them was Peter also, standing, and warming himself.

<span id="an_18:19">18:19</span> The high priest therefore asked Jesus
of his disciples, and of his doctrine.

<span id="an_18:20">18:20</span> Jesus answered him: I have spoken
openly to the world: I have always taught in the synagogue, and in the
temple, whither all the Jews resort; and in secret I have spoken
nothing.

<span id="an_18:21">18:21</span> Why asketh thou me? ask them who have
heard what I have spoken unto them: behold they know what things I have
said.

<span id="an_18:22">18:22</span> And when he had said these things, one
of the servants standing by, gave Jesus a blow, saying: Answerest thou
the high priest so?

<span id="an_18:23">18:23</span> Jesus answered him: If I have spoken
evil, give testimony of the evil; but if well, why strikest thou me?

<span id="an_18:24">18:24</span> And Annas sent him bound to Caiphas the
high priest.

<span id="an_18:25">18:25</span> And Simon Peter was standing, and
warming himself. They said therefore to him: Art not thou also one of
his disciples? He denied it, and said: I am not.

<span id="an_18:26">18:26</span> One of the servants of the high priest
(a kinsman to him whose ear Peter cut off) saith to him: Did I not see
thee in the garden with him?

<span id="an_18:27">18:27</span> Again therefore Peter denied; and
immediately the cock crew.

<span id="an_18:28">18:28</span> Then they led Jesus from Caiphas to the
governor's hall. And it was morning; and they went not into the hall,
that they might not be defiled, but that they might eat the pasch.

<span id="an_18:29">18:29</span> Pilate therefore went out to them, and
said: What accusation bring you against this man?

<span id="an_18:30">18:30</span> They answered, and said to him: If he
were not a malefactor, we would not have delivered him up to thee.

<span id="an_18:31">18:31</span> Pilate therefore said to them: Take him
you, and judge him according to your law. The Jews therefore said to
him: It is not lawful for us to put any man to death;

<span id="an_18:32">18:32</span> That the word of Jesus might be
fulfilled, which he said, signifying what death he should die.

<span id="an_18:33">18:33</span> Pilate therefore went into the hall
again, and called Jesus, and said to him: Art thou the king of the Jews?

<span id="an_18:34">18:34</span> Jesus answered: Sayest thou this thing
of thyself, or have others told it thee of me?

<span id="an_18:35">18:35</span> Pilate answered: Am I a Jew? Thy own
nation, and the chief priests, have delivered thee up to me: what hast
thou done?

<span id="an_18:36">18:36</span> Jesus answered: My kingdom is not of
this world. If my kingdom were of this world, my servants would
certainly strive that I should not be delivered to the Jews: but now my
kingdom is not from hence.

<span id="an_18:37">18:37</span> Pilate therefore said to him: Art thou
a king then? Jesus answered: Thou sayest that I am a king. For this was
I born, and for this came I into the world; that I should give testimony
to the truth. Every one that is of the truth, heareth my voice.

<span id="an_18:38">18:38</span> Pilate saith to him: What is truth? And
when he said this, he went out again to the Jews, and saith to them: I
find no cause in him.

<span id="an_18:39">18:39</span> But you have a custom that I should
release one unto you at the pasch: will you, therefore, that I release
unto you the king of the Jews?

<span id="an_18:40">18:40</span> Then cried they all again, saying: Not
this man, but Barabbas. Now Barabbas was a robber.

<span id="an_19:1">19:1</span> THEN therefore, Pilate took Jesus, and
scourged him.

<span id="an_19:2">19:2</span> And the soldiers platting a crown of
thorns, put it upon his head; and they put on him a purple garment.

<span id="an_19:3">19:3</span> And they came to him, and said: Hail,
king of the Jews; and they gave him blows.

<span id="an_19:4">19:4</span> Pilate therefore went forth again, and
saith to them: Behold, I bring him forth unto you, that you may know
that I find no cause in him.

<span id="an_19:5">19:5</span> (Jesus therefore came forth, bearing the
crown of thorns and the purple garment.) And he saith to them: Behold
the Man.

<span id="an_19:6">19:6</span> When the chief priests, therefore, and
the servants, had seen him, they cried out, saying: Crucify him, crucify
him. Pilate saith to them: Take him you, and crucify him: for I find no
cause in him.

<span id="an_19:7">19:7</span> The Jews answered him: We have a law; and
according to the law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of
God.

<span id="an_19:8">19:8</span> When Pilate therefore had heard this
saying, he feared the more.

<span id="an_19:9">19:9</span> And he entered into the hall again, and
he said to Jesus: Whence art thou? But Jesus gave him no answer.

<span id="an_19:10">19:10</span> Pilate therefore saith to him: Speakest
thou not to me? knowest thou not that I have power to crucify thee, and
I have power to release thee?

<span id="an_19:11">19:11</span> Jesus answered: Thou shouldst not have
any power against me, unless it were given thee from above. Therefore,
he that hath delivered me to thee, hath the greater sin.

<span id="an_19:12">19:12</span> And from henceforth Pilate sought to
release him. But the Jews cried out, saying: If thou release this man,
thou art not Caesar's friend. For whosoever maketh himself a king,
speaketh against Caesar.

<span id="an_19:13">19:13</span> Now when Pilate had heard these words,
he brought Jesus forth, and sat down in the judgment seat, in the place
that is called Lithostrotos, and in Hebrew Gabbatha.

<span id="an_19:14">19:14</span> And it was the parasceve of the pasch,
about the sixth hour, and he saith to the Jews: Behold your king.

<span id="an_19:15">19:15</span> But they cried out: Away with him; away
with him; crucify him. Pilate saith to them: Shall I crucify your king?
The chief priests answered: We have no king but Caesar.

<span id="an_19:16">19:16</span> Then therefore he delivered him to them
to be crucified. And they took Jesus, and led him forth.

<span id="an_19:17">19:17</span> And bearing his own cross, he went
forth to that place which is called Calvary, but in Hebrew Golgotha.

<span id="an_19:18">19:18</span> Where they crucified him, and with him
two others, one on each side, and Jesus in the midst.

<span id="an_19:19">19:19</span> And Pilate wrote a title also, and he
put it upon the cross. And the writing was: JESUS OF NAZARETH, THE KING
OF THE JEWS.

<span id="an_19:20">19:20</span> This title therefore many of the Jews
did read: because the place where Jesus was crucified was nigh to the
city: and it was written in Hebrew, in Greek, and in Latin.

<span id="an_19:21">19:21</span> Then the chief priests of the Jews said
to Pilate: Write not, The King of the Jews; but that he said, I am the
King of the Jews.

<span id="an_19:22">19:22</span> Pilate answered: What I have written, I
have written.

<span id="an_19:23">19:23</span> The soldiers therefore, when they had
crucified him, took his garments, (and they made four parts, to every
soldier a part,) and also his coat. Now the coat was without seam, woven
from the top throughout.

<span id="an_19:24">19:24</span> They said then one to another: Let us
not cut it, but let us cast lots for it, whose it shall be; that the
scripture might be fulfilled, saying: They have parted my garments among
them, and upon my vesture they have cast lot. And the soldiers indeed
did these things.

<span id="an_19:25">19:25</span> Now there stood by the cross of Jesus,
his mother, and his mother's sister, Mary of Cleophas, and Mary
Magdalen.

<span id="an_19:26">19:26</span> When Jesus therefore had seen his
mother and the disciple standing whom he loved, he saith to his mother:
Woman, behold thy son.

<span id="an_19:27">19:27</span> After that, he saith to the disciple:
Behold thy mother. And from that hour, the disciple took her to his own.

<span id="an_19:28">19:28</span> Afterwards, Jesus knowing that all
things were now accomplished, that the scripture might be fulfilled,
said: I thirst.

<span id="an_19:29">19:29</span> Now there was a vessel set there full
of vinegar. And they, putting a sponge full of vinegar and hyssop, put
it to his mouth.

<span id="an_19:30">19:30</span> Jesus therefore, when he had taken the
vinegar, said: It is consummated. And bowing his head, he gave up the
ghost.

<span id="an_19:31">19:31</span> Then the Jews, (because it was the
parasceve,) that the bodies might not remain on the cross on the sabbath
day, (for that was a great sabbath day,) besought Pilate that their legs
might be broken, and that they might be taken away.

<span id="an_19:32">19:32</span> The soldiers therefore came; and they
broke the legs of the first, and of the other that was crucified with
him.

<span id="an_19:33">19:33</span> But after they were come to Jesus, when
they saw that he was already dead, they did not break his legs.

<span id="an_19:34">19:34</span> But one of the soldiers with a spear
opened his side, and immediately there came out blood and water.

<span id="an_19:35">19:35</span> And he that saw it, hath given
testimony, and his testimony is true. And he knoweth that he saith true;
that you also may believe.

<span id="an_19:36">19:36</span> For these things were done, that the
scripture might be fulfilled: You shall not break a bone of him.

<span id="an_19:37">19:37</span> And again another scripture saith: They
shall look on him whom they pierced.

<span id="an_19:38">19:38</span> And after these things, Joseph of
Arimathea (because he was a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of
the Jews) besought Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus. And
Pilate gave leave. He came therefore, and took the body of Jesus.

<span id="an_19:39">19:39</span> And Nicodemus also came, (he who at the
first came to Jesus by night,) bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes,
about an hundred pound weight.

<span id="an_19:40">19:40</span> They took therefore the body of Jesus,
and bound it in linen cloths, with the spices, as the manner of the Jews
is to bury.

<span id="an_19:41">19:41</span> Now there was in the place where he was
crucified, a garden; and in the garden a new sepulchre, wherein no man
yet had been laid.

<span id="an_19:42">19:42</span> There, therefore, because of the
parasceve of the Jews, they laid Jesus, because the sepulchre was nigh
at hand.

<span id="an_20:1">20:1</span> AND on the first day of the week, Mary
Magdalen cometh early, when it was yet dark, unto the sepulchre; and she
saw the stone taken away from the sepulchre.

<span id="an_20:2">20:2</span> She ran, therefore, and cometh to Simon
Peter, and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved, and saith to them:
They have taken away the Lord out of the sepulchre, and we know not
where they have laid him.

<span id="an_20:3">20:3</span> Peter therefore went out, and that other
disciple, and they came to the sepulchre.

<span id="an_20:4">20:4</span> And they both ran together, and that
other disciple did outrun Peter, and came first to the sepulchre.

<span id="an_20:5">20:5</span> And when he stooped down, he saw the
linen cloths lying; but yet he went not in.

<span id="an_20:6">20:6</span> Then cometh Simon Peter, following him,
and went into the sepulchre, and saw the linen cloths lying,

<span id="an_20:7">20:7</span> And the napkin that had been about his
head, not lying with the linen cloths, but apart, wrapped up into one
place.

<span id="an_20:8">20:8</span> Then that other disciple also went in,
who came first to the sepulchre: and he saw, and believed.

<span id="an_20:9">20:9</span> For as yet they knew not the scripture,
that he must rise again from the dead.

<span id="an_20:10">20:10</span> The disciples therefore departed again
to their home.

<span id="an_20:11">20:11</span> But Mary stood at the sepulchre
without, weeping. Now as she was weeping, she stooped down, and looked
into the sepulchre,

<span id="an_20:12">20:12</span> And she saw two angels in white,
sitting, one at the head, and one at the feet, where the body of Jesus
had been laid.

<span id="an_20:13">20:13</span> They say to her: Woman, why weepest
thou? She saith to them: Because they have taken away my Lord; and I
know not where they have laid him.

<span id="an_20:14">20:14</span> When she had thus said, she turned
herself back, and saw Jesus standing; and she knew not that it was
Jesus.

<span id="an_20:15">20:15</span> Jesus saith to her: Woman, why weepest
thou? whom seekest thou? She, thinking it was the gardener, saith to
him: Sir, if thou hast taken him hence, tell me where thou hast laid
him, and I will take him away.

<span id="an_20:16">20:16</span> Jesus saith to her: Mary. She turning,
saith to him: Rabboni (which is to say, Master).

<span id="an_20:17">20:17</span> Jesus saith to her: Do not touch me,
for I am not yet ascended to my Father. But go to my brethren, and say
to them: I ascend to my Father and to your Father, to my God and your
God.

<span id="an_20:18">20:18</span> Mary Magdalen cometh, and telleth the
disciples: I have seen the Lord, and these things he said to me.

<span id="an_20:19">20:19</span> Now when it was late that same day, the
first of the week, and the doors were shut, where the disciples were
gathered together, for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood in the
midst, and said to them: Peace be to you.

<span id="an_20:20">20:20</span> And when he had said this, he shewed
them his hands and his side. The disciples therefore were glad, when
they saw the Lord.

<span id="an_20:21">20:21</span> He said therefore to them again: Peace
be to you. As the Father hath sent me, I also send you.

<span id="an_20:22">20:22</span> When he had said this, he breathed on
them; and he said to them: Receive ye the Holy Ghost.

<span id="an_20:23">20:23</span> Whose sins you shall forgive, they are
forgiven them; and whose sins you shall retain, they are retained.

<span id="an_20:24">20:24</span> Now Thomas, one of the twelve, who is
called Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came.

<span id="an_20:25">20:25</span> The other disciples therefore said to
him: We have seen the Lord. But he said to them: Except I shall see in
his hands the print of the nails, and put my finger into the place of
the nails, and put my hand into his side, I will not believe.

<span id="an_20:26">20:26</span> And after eight days again his
disciples were within, and Thomas with them. Jesus cometh, the doors
being shut, and stood in the midst, and said: Peace be to you.

<span id="an_20:27">20:27</span> Then he saith to Thomas: Put in thy
finger hither, and see my hands; and bring hither thy hand, and put it
into my side; and be not faithless, but believing.

<span id="an_20:28">20:28</span> Thomas answered, and said to him: My
Lord, and my God.

<span id="an_20:29">20:29</span> Jesus saith to him: Because thou hast
seen me, Thomas, thou hast believed: blessed are they that have not
seen, and have believed.

<span id="an_20:30">20:30</span> Many other signs also did Jesus in the
sight of his disciples, which are not written in this book.

<span id="an_20:31">20:31</span> But these are written, that you may
believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God: and that believing,
you may have life in his name.

<span id="an_21:1">21:1</span> AFTER this, Jesus shewed himself again to
the disciples at the sea of Tiberias. And he shewed himself after this
manner.

<span id="an_21:2">21:2</span> There were together Simon Peter, and
Thomas, who is called Didymus, and Nathanael, who was of Cana of
Galilee, and the sons of Zebedee, and two others of his disciples.

<span id="an_21:3">21:3</span> Simon Peter saith to them: I go a
fishing. They say to him: We also come with thee. And they went forth,
and entered into the ship: and that night they caught nothing.

<span id="an_21:4">21:4</span> But when the morning was come, Jesus
stood on the shore: yet the disciples knew not that it was Jesus.

<span id="an_21:5">21:5</span> Jesus therefore said to them: Children,
have you any meat? They answered him: No.

<span id="an_21:6">21:6</span> He saith to them: Cast the net on the
right side of the ship, and you shall find. They cast therefore; and now
they were not able to draw it, for the multitude of fishes.

<span id="an_21:7">21:7</span> That disciple therefore whom Jesus loved,
said to Peter: It is the Lord. Simon Peter, when he heard that it was
the Lord, girt his coat about him, (for he was naked,) and cast himself
into the sea.

<span id="an_21:8">21:8</span> But the other disciples came in the ship,
(for they were not far from the land, but as it were two hundred
cubits,) dragging the net with fishes.

<span id="an_21:9">21:9</span> As soon then as they came to land, they
saw hot coals lying, and a fish laid thereon, and bread.

<span id="an_21:10">21:10</span> Jesus saith to them: Bring hither of
the fishes which you have now caught.

<span id="an_21:11">21:11</span> Simon Peter went up, and drew the net
to land, full of great fishes, one hundred and fifty-three. And although
there were so many, the net was not broken.

<span id="an_21:12">21:12</span> Jesus saith to them: Come, and dine.
And none of them who were at meat, durst ask him: Who art thou? knowing
that it was the Lord.

<span id="an_21:13">21:13</span> And Jesus cometh and taketh bread, and
giveth them, and fish in like manner.

<span id="an_21:14">21:14</span> This is now the third time that Jesus
was manifested to his disciples, after he was risen from the dead.

<span id="an_21:15">21:15</span> When therefore they had dined, Jesus
saith to Simon Peter: Simon son of John, lovest thou me more than these?
He saith to him: Yea, Lord, thou knowest that I love thee. He saith to
him: Feed my lambs.

<span id="an_21:16">21:16</span> He saith to him again: Simon, son of
John, lovest thou me? He saith to him: Yea, Lord, thou knowest that I
love thee. He saith to him: Feed my lambs.

<span id="an_21:17">21:17</span> He said to him the third time: Simon,
son of John, lovest thou me? Peter was grieved, because he had said to
him the third time: Lovest thou me? And he said to him: Lord, thou
knowest all things: thou knowest that I love thee. He said to him: Feed
my sheep.

<span id="an_21:18">21:18</span> Amen, amen I say to thee, when thou
wast younger, thou didst gird thyself, and didst walk where thou
wouldst. But when thou shalt be old, thou shalt stretch forth thy hands,
and another shall gird thee, and lead thee whither thou wouldst not.

<span id="an_21:19">21:19</span> And this he said, signifying by what
death he should glorify God. And when he had said this, he saith to him:
Follow me.

<span id="an_21:20">21:20</span> Peter turning about, saw that disciple
whom Jesus loved following, who also leaned on his breast at supper, and
said: Lord, who is he that shall betray thee?

<span id="an_21:21">21:21</span> Him therefore when Peter had seen, he
saith to Jesus: Lord, and what shall this man do?

<span id="an_21:22">21:22</span> Jesus saith to him: So I will have him
to remain till I come, what is it to thee? follow thou me.

<span id="an_21:23">21:23</span> This saying therefore went abroad among
the brethren, that that disciple should not die. And Jesus did not say
to him: He should not die; but, So I will have him to remain till I
come, what is it to thee?

<span id="an_21:24">21:24</span> This is that disciple who giveth
testimony of these things, and hath written these things; and we know
that his testimony is true.

<span id="an_21:25">21:25</span> But there are also many other things
which Jesus did; which, if they were written every one, the world
itself, I think, would not be able to contain the books that should be
written.
