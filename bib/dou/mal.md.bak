### Douay-Rheims Bible: Malachi

<span id="an_1:1">1:1</span> The burden of the word of the Lord to
Israel by the hand of Malachias.

<span id="an_1:2">1:2</span> I have loved you, saith the Lord: and you
have said: Wherein hast thou loved us? Was not Esau brother to Jacob,
saith the Lord, and I have loved Jacob,

<span id="an_1:3">1:3</span> But have hated Esau? and I have made his
mountains a wilderness, and given his inheritance to the dragons of the
desert.

<span id="an_1:4">1:4</span> But if Edom shall say: We are destroyed,
but we will return and build up what hath been destroyed: thus saith the
Lord of hosts: They shall build up, and I will throw down: and they
shall be called the borders of wickedness, and the people with whom the
Lord is angry for ever.

<span id="an_1:5">1:5</span> And your eyes shall see, and you shall say:
The Lord be magnified upon the border of Israel.

<span id="an_1:6">1:6</span> The son honoureth the father, and the
servant his master: if then I be a father, where is my honour? and if I
be a master, where is my fear? saith the Lord of hosts.

<span id="an_1:7">1:7</span> To you, O priests, that despise my name,
and have said: Wherein have we despised thy name? You offer polluted
bread upon my altar, and you say: Wherein have we polluted thee? In that
you say: The table of the Lord is contemptible.

<span id="an_1:8">1:8</span> If you offer the blind for sacrifice, is it
not evil? and if you offer the lame and the sick, is it not evil? offer
it to thy prince, if he will be pleased with it, or if he will regard
thy face, saith the Lord of hosts.

<span id="an_1:9">1:9</span> And now beseech ye the face of God, that he
may have mercy on you, (for by your hand hath this been done,) if by any
means he will receive your faces, saith the Lord of hosts.

<span id="an_1:10">1:10</span> Who is there among you, that will shut
the doors, and will kindle the fire on my altar gratis? I have no
pleasure in you, saith the Lord of hosts: and I will not receive a gift
of your hand.

<span id="an_1:11">1:11</span> For from the rising of the sun even to
the going down, my name is great among the Gentiles, and in every place
there is sacrifice, and there is offered to my name a clean oblation:
for my name is great among the Gentiles, saith the Lord of hosts.

<span id="an_1:12">1:12</span> And you have profaned it in that you say:
The table of the Lord is defiled: and that which is laid thereupon is
contemptible with the fire that devoureth it.

<span id="an_1:13">1:13</span> And you have said: Behold of our labour,
and you puffed it away, saith the Lord of hosts, and you brought in of
rapine the lame, and the sick, and brought in an offering: shall I
accept it at your hands, saith the Lord?

<span id="an_1:14">1:14</span> Cursed is the deceitful man that hath in
his flock a male, and making a vow offereth in sacrifice that which is
feeble to the Lord: for I am a great King, saith the Lord of hosts, and
my name is dreadful among the Gentiles.

<span id="an_2:1">2:1</span> And now, O ye priests, this commandment is
to you.

<span id="an_2:2">2:2</span> If you will not hear, and if you will not
lay it to heart, to give glory to my name, saith the Lord of hosts: I
will send poverty upon you, and will curse your blessings, yea I will
curse them, because you have not laid it to heart.

<span id="an_2:3">2:3</span> Behold, I will cast the shoulder to you,
and I will scatter upon your face the dung of your solemnities, and it
shall take you away with it.

<span id="an_2:4">2:4</span> And you shall know that I sent you this
commandment, that my covenant might be with Levi, saith the Lord of
hosts.

<span id="an_2:5">2:5</span> My covenant was with him of life and peace:
and I gave him fear: and he feared me, and he was afraid before my name.

<span id="an_2:6">2:6</span> The law of truth was in his mouth, and
iniquity was not found in his lips: he walked with me in peace, and in
equity, and turned many away from iniquity.

<span id="an_2:7">2:7</span> For the lips of the priest shall keep
knowledge, and they shall seek the law at his mouth: because he is the
angel of the Lord of hosts.

<span id="an_2:8">2:8</span> But you have departed out of the way, and
have caused many to stumble at the law: you have made void the covenant
of Levi, saith the Lord of hosts.

<span id="an_2:9">2:9</span> Therefore have I also made you
contemptible, and base before all people, as you have not kept my ways,
and have accepted persons in the law.

<span id="an_2:10">2:10</span> Have we not all one father? hath not one
God created us? why then doth every one of us despise his brother,
violating the covenant of our fathers?

<span id="an_2:11">2:11</span> Juda hath transgressed, and abomination
hath been committed in Israel, and in Jerusalem: for Juda hath profaned
the holiness of the Lord, which he loved, and hath married the daughter
of a strange God.

<span id="an_2:12">2:12</span> The Lord will cut off the man that hath
done this, both the master, and the scholar, out of the tabernacles of
Jacob, and him that offereth an offering to the Lord of hosts.

<span id="an_2:13">2:13</span> And this again have you done, you have
covered the altar of the Lord with tears, with weeping, and bellowing,
so that I have no more a regard to sacrifice, neither do I accept any
atonement at your hands.

<span id="an_2:14">2:14</span> And you have said: For what cause?
Because the Lord hath been witness between thee, and the wife of thy
youth, whom thou hast despised: yet she was thy partner, and the wife of
thy covenant.

<span id="an_2:15">2:15</span> Did not one make her, and she is the
residue of his spirit? And what doth one seek, but the seed of God? Keep
then your spirit, and despise not the wife of thy youth.

<span id="an_2:16">2:16</span> When thou shalt hate her put her away,
saith the Lord the God of Israel: but iniquity shall cover his garment,
saith the Lord of hosts, keep your spirit, and despise not.

<span id="an_2:17">2:17</span> You have wearied the Lord with your
words, and you said: Wherein have we wearied him? In that you say: Every
one that doth evil, is good in the sight of the Lord, and such please
him: or surely where is the God of judgment?

<span id="an_3:1">3:1</span> Behold I send my angel, and he shall
prepare the way before my face. And presently the Lord, whom you seek,
and the angel of the testament, whom you desire, shall come to his
temple. Behold he cometh, saith the Lord of hosts.

<span id="an_3:2">3:2</span> And who shall be able to think of the day
of his coming? and who shall stand to see him? for he is like a refining
fire, and like the fuller's herb:

<span id="an_3:3">3:3</span> And he shall sit refining and cleansing the
silver, and he shall purify the sons of Levi, and shall refine them as
gold, and as silver, and they shall offer sacrifices to the Lord in
justice.

<span id="an_3:4">3:4</span> And the sacrifice of Juda and of Jerusalem
shall please the Lord, as in the days of old, and in the ancient years.

<span id="an_3:5">3:5</span> And I will come to you in judgment, and
will be a speedy witness against sorcerers, and adulterers, and false
swearers, and them that oppress the hireling in his wages; the widows,
and the fatherless: and oppress the stranger, and have not feared me,
saith the Lord of hosts.

<span id="an_3:6">3:6</span> For I am the Lord, and I change not: and
you the sons of Jacob are not consumed.

<span id="an_3:7">3:7</span> For from the days of your fathers you have
departed from my ordinances, and have not kept them: Return to me, and I
will return to you, saith the Lord of hosts. And you have said: Wherein
shall we return?

<span id="an_3:8">3:8</span> Shall a man afflict God? for you afflict
me. And you have said: Wherein do we afflict thee? in tithes and in
firstfruits.

<span id="an_3:9">3:9</span> And you are cursed with want, and you
afflict me, even the whole nation of you.

<span id="an_3:10">3:10</span> Bring all the tithes into the storehouse,
that there may be meat in my house, and try me in this, saith the Lord:
if I open not unto you the flood-gates of heaven, and pour you out a
blessing even to abundance.

<span id="an_3:11">3:11</span> And I will rebuke for your sakes the
devourer, and he shall not spoil the fruit of your land: neither shall
the vine in the field be barren, saith the Lord of hosts.

<span id="an_3:12">3:12</span> And all nations shall call you blessed:
for you shall be a delightful land, saith the Lord of hosts.

<span id="an_3:13">3:13</span> Your words have been unsufferable to me,
saith the Lord.

<span id="an_3:14">3:14</span> And you have said: What have we spoken
against thee? You have said: He laboureth in vain that serveth God, and
what profit is it that we have kept his ordinances, and that we have
walked sorrowful before the Lord of hosts?

<span id="an_3:15">3:15</span> Wherefore now we call the proud people
happy, for they that work wickedness are built up, and they have tempted
God and are preserved.

<span id="an_3:16">3:16</span> Then they that feared the Lord spoke
every one with his neighbour: and the Lord gave ear, and heard it: and a
book of remembrance was written before him for them that fear the Lord,
and think on his name.

<span id="an_3:17">3:17</span> And they shall be my special possession,
saith the Lord of hosts, in the day that I do judgment: and I will spare
them, as a man spareth his son that serveth him.

<span id="an_3:18">3:18</span> And you shall return, and shall see the
difference between the just and the wicked: and between him that serveth
God, and him that serveth him not.

<span id="an_4:1">4:1</span> For behold the day shall come kindled as a
furnace: and all the proud, and all that do wickedly shall be stubble:
and the day that cometh shall set them on fire, saith the Lord of hosts,
it shall not leave them root, nor branch.

<span id="an_4:2">4:2</span> But unto you that fear my name, the Sun of
justice shall arise, and health in his wings: and you shall go forth,
and shall leap like calves of the herd.

<span id="an_4:3">4:3</span> And you shall tread down the wicked when
they shall be ashes under the sole of your feet in the day that I do
this, saith the Lord of hosts.

<span id="an_4:4">4:4</span> Remember the law of Moses my servant, which
I commanded him in Horeb for all Israel, the precepts, and judgments.

<span id="an_4:5">4:5</span> Behold I will send you Elias the prophet,
before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord.

<span id="an_4:6">4:6</span> And he shall turn the heart of the fathers
to the children, and the heart of the children to their fathers: lest I
come, and strike the earth with anathema.
