### Douay-Rheims Bible: Leviticus

<span id="an_1:1">1:1</span> And the Lord called Moses, and spoke to him
from the tabernacle of the testimony, saying:

<span id="an_1:2">1:2</span> Speak to the children of Israel, and thou
shalt say to them: The man among you that shall offer to the Lord a
sacrifice of the cattle, that is, offering victims of oxen and sheep,

<span id="an_1:3">1:3</span> If his offering be a holocaust, and of the
herd, he shall offer a male without blemish, at the door of the
testimony, to make the Lord favourable to him:

<span id="an_1:4">1:4</span> And he shall put his hand upon the head of
the victim, and it shall be acceptable, and help to its expiation.

<span id="an_1:5">1:5</span> And he shall immolate the calf before the
Lord, and the priests the sons of Aaron shall offer the blood thereof,
pouring it round about the altar, which is before the door of the
tabernacle.

<span id="an_1:6">1:6</span> And when they have flayed the victim, they
shall cut the joints into pieces,

<span id="an_1:7">1:7</span> And shall put fire on the altar, having
before laid in order a pile of wood:

<span id="an_1:8">1:8</span> And they shall lay the parts that are cut
out in order thereupon, to wit, the head, and all things that cleave to
the liver,

<span id="an_1:9">1:9</span> The entrails and feet being washed with
water: and the priest shall burn them upon the altar for a holocaust,
and a sweet savour to the Lord.

<span id="an_1:10">1:10</span> And if the offering be of the hocks, a
holocaust of sheep or of goats, he shall offer a male without blemish:

<span id="an_1:11">1:11</span> And he shall immolate it at the side of
the altar that looketh to the north, before the Lord: but the sons of
Aaron shall pour the blood thereof upon the altar round about:

<span id="an_1:12">1:12</span> And they shall divide the joints, the
head, and all that cleave to the liver: and shall lay them upon the
wood, under which the fire is to be put:

<span id="an_1:13">1:13</span> But the entrails and the feet they shall
wash with water. And the priest shall offer it all and burn it all upon
the altar for a holocaust, and most sweet savour to the Lord.

<span id="an_1:14">1:14</span> But if the oblation of a holocaust to the
Lord be of birds, of turtles, or of young pigeons,

<span id="an_1:15">1:15</span> The priest shall offer it at the altar:
and twisting back the neck, and breaking the place of the wound, he
shall make the blood run down upon the brim of the altar.

<span id="an_1:16">1:16</span> But the crop of the throat, and the
feathers he shall cast beside the altar at the east side, in the place
where the ashes are wont to be poured out,

<span id="an_1:17">1:17</span> And he shall break the pinions thereof,
and shall not cut, nor divide it with a knife, and shall burn it upon
the altar, putting fire under the wood. It is a holocaust and oblation
of most sweet savour to the Lord.

<span id="an_2:1">2:1</span> When any one shall offer an oblation of
sacrifice to the Lord, his offering shall be of fine flour, and he shall
pour oil upon it, and put frankincense,

<span id="an_2:2">2:2</span> And shall bring it to the sons of Aaron the
priests: and one of them shall take a handful of the flour and oil, and
all the frankincense, and shall put it a memorial upon the altar for a
most sweet savour to the Lord.

<span id="an_2:3">2:3</span> And the remnant of the sacrifice shall be
Aaron's, and his sons', holy of holies of the offerings of the Lord.

<span id="an_2:4">2:4</span> But when thou offerest a sacrifice baked in
the oven of flour, to wit, loaves without leaven, tempered with oil, and
unleavened wafers, anointed with oil:

<span id="an_2:5">2:5</span> If thy oblation be from the fryingpan, of
flour tempered with oil, and without leaven,

<span id="an_2:6">2:6</span> Thou shalt divide it into little pieces,
and shalt pour oil upon it.

<span id="an_2:7">2:7</span> And if the sacrifice be from the gridiron,
in like manner the flour shall be tempered with oil:

<span id="an_2:8">2:8</span> And when thou offerest it to the Lord, thou
shalt deliver it to the hands of the priest.

<span id="an_2:9">2:9</span> And when he hath offered it, he shall take
a memorial out of the sacrifice, and burn it upon the altar for a sweet
savour to the Lord.

<span id="an_2:10">2:10</span> And whatsoever is left, shall be Aaron's,
and his sons', holy of holies of the offerings of the Lord.

<span id="an_2:11">2:11</span> Every oblation that is offered to the
Lord shall be made without leaven, neither shall any leaven or honey be
burnt in the sacrifice to the Lord.

<span id="an_2:12">2:12</span> You shall offer only the firstfruits of
them and gifts: but they shall not be put upon the altar, for a savour
of sweetness,

<span id="an_2:13">2:13</span> Whatsoever sacrifice thou offerest, thou
shalt season it with salt, neither shalt thou take away the salt of the
covenant of thy God from thy sacrifice. In all thy oblations thou shalt
offer salt.

<span id="an_2:14">2:14</span> But if thou offer a gift of the
firstfruits of thy corn to the Lord, of the ears yet green, thou shalt
dry it at the fire, and break it small like meal, and so shalt thou
offer thy firstfruits to the Lord,

<span id="an_2:15">2:15</span> Pouring oil upon it and putting on
frankincense, because it is the oblation of the Lord.

<span id="an_2:16">2:16</span> Whereof the priest shall burn for a
memorial of the gift, part of the corn broken small and of the oil, and
all the frankincense.

<span id="an_3:1">3:1</span> And if his oblation be a sacrifice of peace
offerings, and he will offer of the herd, whether male or female, he
shall offer them without blemish before the Lord.

<span id="an_3:2">3:2</span> And he shall lay his hand upon the head of
his victim, which shall be slain in the entry of the tabernacle of the
testimony, and the sons of Aaron the priests shall pour the blood round
about upon the altar.

<span id="an_3:3">3:3</span> And they shall offer of the sacrifice of
peace offerings, for an oblation to the Lord, the fat that covereth the
entrails, and all the fat that is within.

<span id="an_3:4">3:4</span> The two kidneys with the fat wherewith the
flanks are covered, and the caul of the liver with the two little
kidneys.

<span id="an_3:5">3:5</span> And they shall burn them upon the altar,
for a holocaust, putting fire under the wood: for an oblation of most
sweet savour to the Lord.

<span id="an_3:6">3:6</span> But if his oblation and the sacrifice of
peace offering be of the flock, whether he offer male or female, they
shall be without blemish.

<span id="an_3:7">3:7</span> If he offer a lamb before the Lord,

<span id="an_3:8">3:8</span> He shall put his hand upon the head of his
victim: and it shall be slain in the entry of the tabernacle of the
testimony: and the sons of Aaron shall pour the blood thereof round
about upon the altar.

<span id="an_3:9">3:9</span> And they shall offer of the victim of peace
offerings a sacrifice to the Lord: the fat and the whole rump,

<span id="an_3:10">3:10</span> With the kidneys, and the fat that
covereth the belly and all the vitals and both the little kidneys, with
the fat that is about the flanks, and the caul of the liver with the
little kidneys.

<span id="an_3:11">3:11</span> And the priest shall burn them upon the
altar, for the food of the fire, and of the oblation of the Lord.

<span id="an_3:12">3:12</span> If his offering be a goat, and he offer
it to the Lord,

<span id="an_3:13">3:13</span> He shall put his hand upon the head
thereof: and shall immolate it in the entry of the tabernacle of the
testimony. And the sons of Aaron shall pour the blood thereof round
about upon the altar.

<span id="an_3:14">3:14</span> And they shall take of it for the food of
the Lord's fire, the fat that covereth the belly, and that covereth all
the vital parts :

<span id="an_3:15">3:15</span> The two little kidneys with the caul that
is upon them which is by the flanks, and the fat of the liver with the
little kidneys:

<span id="an_3:16">3:16</span> And the priest shall burn them upon the
altar, for the food of the fire, and of a most sweet savour. All the fat
shall be the Lord's.

<span id="an_3:17">3:17</span> By a perpetual law for your generations,
and in all your habitations: neither blood nor fat shall you eat at all.

<span id="an_4:1">4:1</span> And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:

<span id="an_4:2">4:2</span> Say to the children of Israel: The soul
that sinneth through ignorance, and doth any thing concerning any of the
commandments of the Lord, which he commanded not to be done:

<span id="an_4:3">4:3</span> If the priest that is anointed shall sin,
making the people to offend, he shall offer to the Lord for his sin a
calf without blemish.

<span id="an_4:4">4:4</span> And he shall bring it to the door of the
testimony before the Lord, and shall put his hand upon the head thereof,
and shall sacrifice it to the Lord.

<span id="an_4:5">4:5</span> He shall take also of the blood of the
calf, and carry it into the tabernacle of the testimony.

<span id="an_4:6">4:6</span> And having dipped his finger in the blood,
he shall sprinkle with it seven times before the Lord, before the veil
of the sanctuary.

<span id="an_4:7">4:7</span> And he shall put some of the same blood
upon the horns of the altar of the sweet incense most acceptable to the
Lord, which is in the tabernacle of the testimony. And he shall pour all
the rest of the blood at the foot of the altar of holocaust in the entry
of the tabernacle.

<span id="an_4:8">4:8</span> And he shall take off the fat of the calf
for the sin offering, as well that which covereth the entrails, as all
the inwards:

<span id="an_4:9">4:9</span> The two little kidneys, and the caul that
is upon them, which is by the hanks, and the fat of the liver with the
little kidneys,

<span id="an_4:10">4:10</span> As it is taken off from the calf of the
sacrifice of peace offerings, and he shall burn them upon the altar of
holocaust.

<span id="an_4:11">4:11</span> But the skin and all the flesh with the
head and the feet and the bowels and the dung,

<span id="an_4:12">4:12</span> And the rest of the body he shall carry
forth without the camp into a clean place where the ashes are wont to be
poured out, and he shall burn them upon a pile of wood, they shall be
burnt in the place where the ashes are poured out.

<span id="an_4:13">4:13</span> And if all the multitude of Israel shall
be ignorant, and through ignorance shall do that which is against the
commandment of the Lord,

<span id="an_4:14">4:14</span> And afterwards shall understand their
sin, they shall offer for their sin a calf, and shall bring it to the
door of the tabernacle.

<span id="an_4:15">4:15</span> And the ancients of the people shall put
their hands upon the head thereof before the Lord. And the calf being
immolated in the sight of the Lord,

<span id="an_4:16">4:16</span> The priest that is anointed shall carry
of the blood into the tabernacle of the testimony.

<span id="an_4:17">4:17</span> And shall dip his finger in it and
sprinkle it seven times before the veil.

<span id="an_4:18">4:18</span> And he shall put of the same blood on the
horns of the altar that is before the Lord, in the tabernacle of the
testimony: and the rest of the blood he shall pour at the foot of the
altar of holocaust, which is at the door of the tabernacle of the
testimony.

<span id="an_4:19">4:19</span> And all the fat thereof he shall take
off, and shall burn it upon the altar:

<span id="an_4:20">4:20</span> Doing so with this calf, as he did also
with that before: and the priest praying for them, the Lord will be
merciful unto them.

<span id="an_4:21">4:21</span> But the calf itself he shall carry forth
without the camp, and shall burn it as he did the former calf: because
it is for the sin of the multitude.

<span id="an_4:22">4:22</span> If a prince shall sin, and through
ignorance do any one of the things that the law of the Lord forbiddeth,

<span id="an_4:23">4:23</span> And afterwards shall come to know his
sin, he shall offer a buck goat without blemish, a sacrifice to the
Lord.

<span id="an_4:24">4:24</span> And he shall put his hand upon the head
thereof: and when he hath immolated it in the place where the holocaust
is wont to be slain before the Lord, because it is for sin,

<span id="an_4:25">4:25</span> The priest shall dip his finger in the
blood of the victim for sin, touching therewith the horns of the altar
of holocaust, and pouring out the rest at the foot thereof.

<span id="an_4:26">4:26</span> But the fat he shall burn upon it, as is
wont to be done with the victims of peace offerings: and the priest
shall pray for him, and for his sin, and it shall be forgiven him.

<span id="an_4:27">4:27</span> And if any one of the people of the land
shall sin through ignorance, doing any of those things that by the law
of the Lord are forbidden, and offending,

<span id="an_4:28">4:28</span> And shall come to know his sin, he shall
offer a she goat without blemish.

<span id="an_4:29">4:29</span> And he shall put his hand upon the head
of the victim that is for sin, and shall immolate it in the place of the
holocaust.

<span id="an_4:30">4:30</span> And the priest shall take of the blood
with his finger, and shall touch the horns of the altar of holocaust,
and shall pour out the rest at the foot thereof.

<span id="an_4:31">4:31</span> But taking off all the fat, as is wont to
be taken away of the victims of peace offerings, he shall burn it upon
the altar, for a sweet savour to the Lord: and he shall pray for him,
and it shall be forgiven him.

<span id="an_4:32">4:32</span> But if he offer of the flock a victim for
his sin, to wit, an ewe without blemish:

<span id="an_4:33">4:33</span> He shall put his hand upon the head
thereof, and shall immolate it in the place where the victims of
holocausts are wont to be slain.

<span id="an_4:34">4:34</span> And the priest shall take of the blood
thereof with his finger, and shall touch the horns of the altar of
holocaust, and the rest he shall pour out at the foot thereof.

<span id="an_4:35">4:35</span> All the fat also he shall take off, as
the fat of the ram that is offered for peace offerings is wont to be
taken away: and shall burn it upon the altar, for a burnt sacrifice of
the Lord: and he shall pray for him and for his sin, and it shall be
forgiven him.

<span id="an_5:1">5:1</span> If any one sin, and hear the voice of one
swearing, and is a witness either because he himself hath seen, or is
privy to it: if he do not utter it, he shall bear his iniquity.

<span id="an_5:2">5:2</span> Whosoever toucheth any unclean thing,
either that which hath been killed by a beast, or died of itself, or any
other creeping thing: and forgetteth his uncleanness, he is guilty, and
hath offended:

<span id="an_5:3">5:3</span> And if he touch any thing of the
uncleanness of man, according to any uncleanness wherewith he is wont to
be defiled, and having forgotten it, come afterwards to know it, he
shall be guilty of an offence.

<span id="an_5:4">5:4</span> The person that sweareth, and uttereth with
his lips, that he would do either evil or good, and bindeth the same
with an oath, and his word, and having forgotten it afterwards
understandeth his offence,

<span id="an_5:5">5:5</span> Let him do penance for his sin,

<span id="an_5:6">5:6</span> And offer of the flocks an ewe lamb, or a
she goat, and the priest shall pray for him and for his sin:

<span id="an_5:7">5:7</span> But if he be not able to offer a beast, let
him offer two turtles, or two young pigeons to the Lord, one for sin,
and the other for a holocaust,

<span id="an_5:8">5:8</span> And he shall give them to the priest: who
shall offer the first for sin, and twist back the head of it to the
little pinions, so that it stick to the neck, and be not altogether
broken off.

<span id="an_5:9">5:9</span> And of its blood he shall sprinkle the side
of the altar, and whatsoever is left, he shall let it drop at the bottom
thereof, because it is for sin.

<span id="an_5:10">5:10</span> And the other he shall burn for a
holocaust, as is wont to be done: and the priest shall pray for him, and
for his sin, and it shall be forgiven him.

<span id="an_5:11">5:11</span> And if his hand be not able to offer two
turtles, or two young pigeons, he shall offer for his sin the tenth part
of an ephi of flour. He shall not put oil upon it, nor put any
frankincense thereon, because it is for sin:

<span id="an_5:12">5:12</span> And he shall deliver it to the priest:
who shall take a handful thereof, and shall burn it upon the altar for a
memorial of him that offered it:

<span id="an_5:13">5:13</span> Praying for him and making atonement: but
the part that is left, he himself shall have for a gift.

<span id="an_5:14">5:14</span> And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:

<span id="an_5:15">5:15</span> If any one shall sin through mistake,
transgressing the ceremonies in those things that are sacrificed to the
Lord, he shall offer for his offence a ram without blemish out of the
flocks, that may be bought for two sicles, according to the weight of
the sanctuary:

<span id="an_5:16">5:16</span> And he shall make good the damage itself
which he hath done, and shall add the fifth part besides, delivering it
to the priest, who shall pray for him, offering the ram, and it shall be
forgiven him.

<span id="an_5:17">5:17</span> If any one sin through ignorance, and do
one of those things which by the law of the Lord are forbidden, and
being guilty of sin, understand his iniquity,

<span id="an_5:18">5:18</span> He shall offer of the hocks a ram without
blemish to the priest, according to the measure and estimation of the
sin: and the priest shall pray for him, because he did it ignorantly:
and it shall be forgiven him,

<span id="an_5:19">5:19</span> Because by mistake he trespassed against
the Lord.

<span id="an_6:1">6:1</span> The Lord spoke to Moses, saying:

<span id="an_6:2">6:2</span> Whosoever shall sin, and despising the
Lord, shall deny to his neighbour the thing delivered to his keeping,
which was committed to his trust; or shall by force extort any thing, or
commit oppression;

<span id="an_6:3">6:3</span> Or shall find a thing lost, and denying it,
shall also swear falsely, or shall do any other of the many things,
wherein men are wont to sin:

<span id="an_6:4">6:4</span> Being convicted of the offence, he shall
restore

<span id="an_6:5">6:5</span> All that he would have gotten by fraud, in
the principal, and the fifth part besides to the owner, whom he wronged.

<span id="an_6:6">6:6</span> Moreover for his sin he shall offer a ram
without blemish out of the flock, and shall give it to the priest,
according to the estimation and measure of the offence:

<span id="an_6:7">6:7</span> And he shall pray for him before the Lord,
and he shall have forgiveness for every thing in doing of which he hath
sinned.

<span id="an_6:8">6:8</span> And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:

<span id="an_6:9">6:9</span> Command Aaron and his sons: This is the law
of a holocaust: It shall be burnt upon the altar, all night until
morning: the fire shall be of the same altar.

<span id="an_6:10">6:10</span> The priest shall be vested with the
tunick and the linen breeches, and he shall take up the ashes of that
which the devouring fire hath burnt, and putting them beside the altar,

<span id="an_6:11">6:11</span> Shall put off his former vestments, and
being clothed with others, shall carry them forth without the camp, and
shall cause them to be consumed to dust in a very clean place,

<span id="an_6:12">6:12</span> And the fire on the altar shall always
burn, and the priest shall feed it, putting wood on it every day in the
morning, and laying on the holocaust, shall burn thereupon the fat of
the peace offerings.

<span id="an_6:13">6:13</span> This is the perpetual fire which shall
never go out on the altar.

<span id="an_6:14">6:14</span> This is the law of the sacrifice and
libations, which the children of Aaron shall offer before the Lord, and
before the altar.

<span id="an_6:15">6:15</span> The priest shall take a handful of the
flour that is tempered with oil, and all the frankincense that is put
upon the flour: and he shall burn it on the altar for a memorial of most
sweet odour to the Lord:

<span id="an_6:16">6:16</span> And the part of the flour that is left,
Aaron and his sons shall eat, without leaven: and he shall eat it in the
holy place of the court of the tabernacle.

<span id="an_6:17">6:17</span> And therefore it shall not be leavened,
because part thereof is offered for the burnt sacrifice of the Lord. It
shall be most holy, as that which is offered for sin and for trespass.

<span id="an_6:18">6:18</span> The males only of the race of Aaron shall
eat it. It shall be an ordinance everlasting in your generations
concerning the sacrifices of the Lord: Every one that toucheth them
shall be sanctified.

<span id="an_6:19">6:19</span> And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:

<span id="an_6:20">6:20</span> This is the oblation of Aaron, and of his
sons, which they must offer to the Lord, in the day of their anointing:
They shall offer the tenth part of an ephi of flour for a perpetual
sacrifice, half of it in the morning, and half of it in the evening:

<span id="an_6:21">6:21</span> It shall be tempered with oil, and shall
be fried in a fryingpan.

<span id="an_6:22">6:22</span> And the priest that rightfully succeedeth
his father, shall offer it hot, for a most sweet odour to the Lord, and
it shall be wholly burnt on the altar.

<span id="an_6:23">6:23</span> For every sacrifice of the priest shall
be consumed with fire, neither shall any man eat thereof.

<span id="an_6:24">6:24</span> And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:

<span id="an_6:25">6:25</span> Say to Aaron and his sons: This is the
law of the victim for sin: in the place where the holocaust is offered,
it shall be immolated before the Lord. It is holy of holies.

<span id="an_6:26">6:26</span> The priest that offereth it, shall eat it
in a holy place, in the court of the tabernacle.

<span id="an_6:27">6:27</span> Whatsoever shall touch the flesh thereof,
shall be sanctified. If a garment be sprinkled with the blood thereof,
it shall be washed in a holy place.

<span id="an_6:28">6:28</span> And the earthen vessel, wherein it was
sodden, shall be broken, but if the vessel be of brass, it shall be
scoured, and washed with water.

<span id="an_6:29">6:29</span> Every male of the priestly race shall eat
of the flesh thereof, because it is holy of holies.

<span id="an_6:30">6:30</span> For the victim that is slain for sin, the
blood of which is carried into the tabernacle of the testimony to make
atonement in the sanctuary, shall not be eaten, but shall be burnt with
fire.

<span id="an_7:1">7:1</span> This also is the law of the sacrifice for a
trespass, it is most holy:

<span id="an_7:2">7:2</span> Therefore where the holocaust is immolated,
the victim also for a trespass shall be slain: the blood thereof shall
be poured round about the altar.

<span id="an_7:3">7:3</span> They shall offer thereof the rump and the
fat that covereth the entrails:

<span id="an_7:4">7:4</span> The two little kidneys, and the fat which
is by the flanks, and the caul of the liver with the little kidneys.

<span id="an_7:5">7:5</span> And the priest shall burn them upon the
altar: it is the burnt sacrifice of the Lord for a trespass.

<span id="an_7:6">7:6</span> Every male of the priestly race, shall eat
this flesh in a holy place, because it is most holy.

<span id="an_7:7">7:7</span> As the sacrifice for sin is offered, so is
also that for a trespass: the same shall be the law of both these
sacrifices: it shall belong to the priest that offereth it.

<span id="an_7:8">7:8</span> The priest that offereth the victim of
holocaust, shall have the skin thereof.

<span id="an_7:9">7:9</span> And every sacrifice of flour that is baked
in the oven, and whatsoever is dressed on the gridiron, or in the
fryingpan, shall be the priest's that offereth it:

<span id="an_7:10">7:10</span> Whether they be tempered with oil, or
dry, all the sons of Aaron shall have one as much as another.

<span id="an_7:11">7:11</span> This is the law of the sacrifice of peace
offerings that is offered to the Lord.

<span id="an_7:12">7:12</span> If the oblation be for thanksgiving, they
shall offer leaves without leaven tempered with oil, and unleavened
wafers anointed with oil, and fine flour fried, and cakes tempered and
mingled with oil:

<span id="an_7:13">7:13</span> Moreover leaves of leavened bread with
the sacrifice of thanks, which is offered for peace offerings:

<span id="an_7:14">7:14</span> Of which one shall be offered to the Lord
for firstfruits, and shall be the priest's that shall pour out the blood
of the victim.

<span id="an_7:15">7:15</span> And the flesh of it shall be eaten the
same day, neither shall any of it remain until the morning.

<span id="an_7:16">7:16</span> If any man by vow, or of his own accord
offer a sacrifice, it shall in like manner be eaten the same day: and if
any of it remain until the morrow, it is lawful to eat it:

<span id="an_7:17">7:17</span> But whatsoever shall be found on the
third day shall be consumed with fire.

<span id="an_7:18">7:18</span> If any man eat of the flesh of the victim
of peace offerings on the third day, the oblation shall be of no effect,
neither shall it profit the offerer: yea rather whatsoever soul shall
defile itself with such meat, shall be guilty of transgression.

<span id="an_7:19">7:19</span> The flesh that hath touched any unclean
thing, shall not be eaten, but shall be burnt with fire: he that is
clean shall eat of it.

<span id="an_7:20">7:20</span> If any one that is defiled shall eat of
the flesh of the sacrifice of peace offerings, which is offered to the
Lord, he shall be cut off from his people.

<span id="an_7:21">7:21</span> And he that hath touched the uncleanness
of man, or of beast, or of any thing that can defile, and shall eat of
such kind of flesh, shall be cut off from his people.

<span id="an_7:22">7:22</span> And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:

<span id="an_7:23">7:23</span> Say to the children of Israel: The fat of
a sheep, and of an ox, and of a goat you shall not eat.

<span id="an_7:24">7:24</span> The fat of a carcass that hath died of
itself, and of a beast that was caught by another beast, you shall have
for divers uses.

<span id="an_7:25">7:25</span> If any man eat the fat that should be
offered for the burnt sacrifice of the Lord, he shall perish out of his
people.

<span id="an_7:26">7:26</span> Moreover you shall not eat the blood of
any creature whatsoever, whether of birds or beasts.

<span id="an_7:27">7:27</span> Every one that eateth blood, shall perish
from among the people.

<span id="an_7:28">7:28</span> And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:

<span id="an_7:29">7:29</span> Speak to the children of Israel, saying:
He that offereth a victim of peace offerings to the Lord, let him offer
therewith a sacrifice also, that is, the libations thereof.

<span id="an_7:30">7:30</span> He shall hold in his hands the fat of the
victim, and the breast: and when he hath offered and consecrated both to
the Lord, he shall deliver them to the priest,

<span id="an_7:31">7:31</span> Who shall burn the fat upon the altar,
but the breast shall be Aaron's and his sons'.

<span id="an_7:32">7:32</span> The right shoulder also of the victims of
peace offerings shall fall to the priest for firstfruits.

<span id="an_7:33">7:33</span> He among the sons of Aaron, that offereth
the blood, and the fat, he shall have the right shoulder also for his
portion.

<span id="an_7:34">7:34</span> For the breast that is elevated and the
shoulder that is separated I have taken of the children of Israel, from
off their victims of peace offerings, and have given them to Aaron the
priest, and to his sons, by a law for ever, from all the people of
Israel.

<span id="an_7:35">7:35</span> This is the anointing of Aaron and his
sons, in the ceremonies of the Lord, in the day when Moses offered them,
that they might do the office of priesthood,

<span id="an_7:36">7:36</span> And the things that the Lord commanded to
be given them by the children of Israel, by a perpetual observance in
their generations.

<span id="an_7:37">7:37</span> This is the law of holocaust, and of the
sacrifice for sin, and for trespass, and for consecration, and the
victims of peace offerings:

<span id="an_7:38">7:38</span> Which the Lord appointed to Moses in
mount Sinai, when he commanded the children of Israel, that they should
offer their oblations to the Lord in the desert of Sinai.

<span id="an_8:1">8:1</span> And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:

<span id="an_8:2">8:2</span> Take Aaron with his sons, their vestments,
and the oil of unction, a calf for sin, two rams, a basket with
unleavened bread,

<span id="an_8:3">8:3</span> And thou shalt gather together all the
congregation to the door of the tabernacle.

<span id="an_8:4">8:4</span> And Moses did as the Lord had commanded.
And all the multitude being gathered together before the door of the
tabernacle,

<span id="an_8:5">8:5</span> He said: This is the word that the Lord
hath commanded to be done.

<span id="an_8:6">8:6</span> And immediately he offered Aaron and his
sons: and when he had washed them,

<span id="an_8:7">8:7</span> He vested the high priest with the strait
linen garment, girding him with the girdle, and putting on him the
violet tunick, and over it he put the ephod,

<span id="an_8:8">8:8</span> And binding it with the girdle, he fitted
it to the rational, on which was Doctrine and Truth.

<span id="an_8:9">8:9</span> He put also the mitre upon his head: and
upon the mitre over the forehead, he put the plate of gold, consecrated
with sanctification, as the Lord had commanded him.

<span id="an_8:10">8:10</span> He took also the oil of unction, with
which he anointed the tabernacle, with all the furniture thereof.

<span id="an_8:11">8:11</span> And when he had sanctified and sprinkled
the altar seven times, he anointed it, and all the vessels thereof, and
the laver with the foot thereof, he sanctified with the oil.

<span id="an_8:12">8:12</span> And he poured it upon Aaron's head, and
he anointed and consecrated him :

<span id="an_8:13">8:13</span> And after he had offered his sons, he
vested them with linen tunicks, and girded them with girdles, and put
mitres on them as the Lord had commanded.

<span id="an_8:14">8:14</span> He offered also the calf for sin: and
when Aaron and his sons had put their hands upon the head thereof,

<span id="an_8:15">8:15</span> He immolated it: and took the blood, and
dipping his finger in it, he touched the horns of the altar round about.
Which being expiated, and sanctified, he poured the rest of the blood at
the bottom thereof.

<span id="an_8:16">8:16</span> But the fat that was upon the entrails,
and the caul of the liver, and the two little kidneys, with their fat,
he burnt upon the altar:

<span id="an_8:17">8:17</span> And the calf with the skin, and the flesh
and the dung, he burnt without the camp, as the Lord had commanded.

<span id="an_8:18">8:18</span> He offered also a ram for a holocaust:
and when Aaron and his sons had put their hands upon its head,

<span id="an_8:19">8:19</span> He immolated it, and poured the blood
thereof round about upon the altar.

<span id="an_8:20">8:20</span> And cutting the ram into pieces, the head
thereof, and the joints, and the fat he burnt in the fire,

<span id="an_8:21">8:21</span> Having first washed the entrails, and the
feet, and the whole ram together he burnt upon the altar, because it was
a holocaust of most sweet odour to the Lord, as he had commanded him.

<span id="an_8:22">8:22</span> He offered also the second ram, in the
consecration of priests: and Aaron, and his sons put their hands upon
the head thereof:

<span id="an_8:23">8:23</span> And when Moses had immolated it, he took
of the blood thereof, and touched the tip of Aaron's right ear, and the
thumb of his right hand, and in like manner also the great toe of his
right foot.

<span id="an_8:24">8:24</span> He offered also the sons of Aaron: and
when with the blood of the ram that was immolated, he had touched the
tip of the right ear of every one of them, and the thumbs of their right
hands, and the great toes of their right feet, the rest he poured on the
altar round about:

<span id="an_8:25">8:25</span> But the fat, and the rump, and all the
fat that covereth the entrails, and the caul of the liver, and the two
kidneys with their fat, and with the right shoulder, he separated.

<span id="an_8:26">8:26</span> And taking out of the basket; of
unleavened bread, which was before the Lord, a loaf without leaven, and
a cake tempered with oil and a wafer, he put them upon the fat, and the
right shoulder,

<span id="an_8:27">8:27</span> Delivering all to Aaron, and to his sons:
wile having lifted them up before the Lord,

<span id="an_8:28">8:28</span> He took them again from their hands, and
burnt them upon the altar of holocaust, because it was the oblation of
consecration, for a sweet odour of sacrifice to the Lord.

<span id="an_8:29">8:29</span> And he took of the ram of consecration,
the breast for his portion, elevating it before the Lord, as the Lord
had commanded him.

<span id="an_8:30">8:30</span> And taking the ointment, and the blood
that was upon the altar, he sprinkled Aaron, and his vestments, and his
sons, and their vestments with it.

<span id="an_8:31">8:31</span> And when he had sanctified them in their
vestments, he commanded them, saying: Boil the flesh before the door of
the tabernacle, and there eat it. Eat ye also the loaves of
consecration, that are laid in the basket, as the Lord commanded me,
saying: Aaron and his sons shall eat them:

<span id="an_8:32">8:32</span> And whatsoever shall be left of the flesh
and the leaves, shall be consumed with fire.

<span id="an_8:33">8:33</span> And you shall not go out of the door of
the tabernacle for seven days, until the day wherein the time of your
consecration shall be expired. For in seven days the consecration is
finished:

<span id="an_8:34">8:34</span> As at this present it hath been done,
that the rite of the sacrifice might be accomplished.

<span id="an_8:35">8:35</span> Day and night shall you remain in the
tabernacle observing the watches of the Lord, lest you die: for so it
hath been commanded me.

<span id="an_8:36">8:36</span> And Aaron and his sons did all things
which the Lord spoke by the hand of Moses.

<span id="an_9:1">9:1</span> And when the eighth day was come, Moses
called Aaron and his sons, and the ancients of Israel, and said to
Aaron:

<span id="an_9:2">9:2</span> Take of the herd a calf for sin, and a ram
for a holocaust, both without blemish, and offer them before the Lord.

<span id="an_9:3">9:3</span> And to the children of Israel thou shalt
say: Take ye a he goat for sin, and a calf, and a lamb, both of a year
old, and without blemish for a holocaust,

<span id="an_9:4">9:4</span> Also a bullock and a ram for peace
offerings: and immolate them before the Lord, offering for the sacrifice
of every one of them flour tempered with oil; for to day the Lord will
appear to you.

<span id="an_9:5">9:5</span> They brought therefore all things that
Moses had commanded before the door of the tabernacle: where when all
the multitude stood,

<span id="an_9:6">9:6</span> Moses said: This is the word, which the
Lord hath commanded: do it, and his glory will appear to you.

<span id="an_9:7">9:7</span> And he said to Aaron: Approach to the
altar, and offer sacrifice for thy sin: offer the holocaust, and pray
for thyself and for the people: and when thou hast slain the people's
victim, pray for them, as the Lord hath commanded.

<span id="an_9:8">9:8</span> And forthwith Aaron, approaching to the
altar, immolated the calf for his sin:

<span id="an_9:9">9:9</span> And his sons brought him the blood of it:
and he dipped his finger therein, and touched the horns of the altar,
and poured the rest at the foot thereof.

<span id="an_9:10">9:10</span> And the fat, and the little kidneys, and
the caul of the liver, which are for sin, he burnt upon the altar, as
the Lord had commanded Moses:

<span id="an_9:11">9:11</span> But the flesh and skins thereof he burnt
with fire without the camp.

<span id="an_9:12">9:12</span> He immolated also the victim of
holocaust: and his sons brought him the blood thereof, which he poured
round about on the altar.

<span id="an_9:13">9:13</span> And the victim being cut into pieces,
they brought to him the head and all the members, all which he burnt
with fire upon the altar,

<span id="an_9:14">9:14</span> Having first washed the entrails and the
feet with water.

<span id="an_9:15">9:15</span> Then offering for the sin of the people,
he slew the he goat: and expiating the altar,

<span id="an_9:16">9:16</span> He offered the holocaust:

<span id="an_9:17">9:17</span> Adding in the sacrifice the libations,
which are offered withal, and burning them upon the altar, besides the
ceremonies of the morning holocaust.

<span id="an_9:18">9:18</span> He immolated also the bullock and the
ram, the peace offerings of the people: and his sons brought him the
blood, which he poured upon the altar round about.

<span id="an_9:19">9:19</span> The fat also of the bullock, and the rump
of the ram, and the two little kidneys, with their fat, and the caul of
the liver,

<span id="an_9:20">9:20</span> They put upon the breasts. And after the
fat was burnt upon the altar,

<span id="an_9:21">9:21</span> Aaron separated their breasts, and the
right shoulders, elevating them before the Lord, as Moses had commanded.

<span id="an_9:22">9:22</span> And stretching forth his hands to the
people, he blessed them. And so the victims for sin, and the holocausts,
and the peace offerings being finished, he came down.

<span id="an_9:23">9:23</span> And Moses and Aaron went into the
tabernacle of the testimony, and afterwards came forth and blessed the
people. And the glory of the Lord appeared to all the multitude:

<span id="an_9:24">9:24</span> And behold a fire, coming forth from the
Lord, devoured the holocaust, and the fat that was upon the altar: which
when the multitude saw, they praised the Lord, falling on their faces.

<span id="an_10:1">10:1</span> And Nadab and Abiu, the sons of Aaron,
taking their censers, put fire therein, and incense on it, offering
before the Lord strange fire: which was not commanded them.

<span id="an_10:2">10:2</span> And fire coming out from the Lord
destroyed them, and they died before the Lord.

<span id="an_10:3">10:3</span> And Moses said to Aaron: This is what the
Lord hath spoken: I will be sanctified in them that approach to me, and
I will be glorified in the sight of all the people. And when Aaron heard
this, he held his peace.

<span id="an_10:4">10:4</span> And Moses called Misael and Elisaphan,
the sons of Oziel, the uncle of Aaron, and said to them: Go and take
away your brethren from before the sanctuary, and carry them without the
camp.

<span id="an_10:5">10:5</span> And they went forthwith and took them as
they lay, vested with linen tunicks, and cast them forth, as had been
commanded them.

<span id="an_10:6">10:6</span> And Moses said to Aaron, and to Eleazar
and Ithamar, his sons: Uncover not your heads, and rend not your
garments, lest perhaps you die, and indignation come upon all the
congregation. Let your brethren, and all the house of Israel, bewail the
burning which the Lord has kindled:

<span id="an_10:7">10:7</span> But you shall not go out of the door of
the tabernacle, otherwise you shall perish, for the oil of the holy
unction is on you. And they did all things according to the precept of
Moses.

<span id="an_10:8">10:8</span> The Lord also said to Aaron:

<span id="an_10:9">10:9</span> You shall not drink wine nor any thing
that may make drunk, thou nor thy sons, when you enter into the
tabernacle of the testimony, lest you die: because it is an everlasting
precept through your generations :

<span id="an_10:10">10:10</span> And that you may have knowledge to
discern between holy and unholy, between unclean and clean:

<span id="an_10:11">10:11</span> And may teach the children of Israel
all my ordinances which the Lord hath spoken to them by the hand of
Moses.

<span id="an_10:12">10:12</span> And Moses spoke to Aaron, and to
Eleazar and Ithamar, his sons that were left: Take the sacrifice that is
remaining of the oblation of the Lord, and eat it without leaven beside
the altar, because it is holy of holies.

<span id="an_10:13">10:13</span> And you shall eat it in a holy place:
which is given to thee and thy sons of the oblations of the Lord, as it
hath been commanded me.

<span id="an_10:14">10:14</span> The breast also that is offered, and
the shoulder that is separated, you shall eat in a most clean place,
thou and thy sons, and thy daughters with thee. For they are set aside
for thee and thy children, of the victims of peace offerings of the
children of Israel:

<span id="an_10:15">10:15</span> Because they have elevated before the
Lord the shoulder and the breast, and the fat that is burnt on the
altar, and they belong to thee and to thy sons by a perpetual law, as
the Lord hath commanded.

<span id="an_10:16">10:16</span> While these things were a doing, when
Moses sought for the buck goat, that had been offered for sin, he found
it burnt: and being angry with Eleazar and Ithamar, the sons of Aaron
that were left, he said:

<span id="an_10:17">10:17</span> Why did you not eat in the holy place
the sacrifice for sin, which is most holy, and given to you, that you
may bear the iniquity of the people, and may pray for them in the sight
of the Lord,

<span id="an_10:18">10:18</span> Especially whereas none of the blood
thereof hath been carried within the holy places, and you ought to have
eaten it in the sanctuary, as was commanded me?

<span id="an_10:19">10:19</span> Aaron answered: This day hath been
offered the victim for sin, and the holocaust before the Lord: and to me
what thou seest has happened: how could I eat it, or please the Lord in
the ceremonies, having a sorrowful heart?

<span id="an_10:20">10:20</span> Which when Moses had heard he was
satisfied.

<span id="an_11:1">11:1</span> And the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron,
saying:

<span id="an_11:2">11:2</span> Say to the children of Israel: These are
the animals which you are to eat of all the living things of the earth.

<span id="an_11:3">11:3</span> Whatsoever hath the hoof divided, and
cheweth the cud among the beasts, you shall eat.

<span id="an_11:4">11:4</span> But whatsoever cheweth indeed the cud,
and hath a hoof, but divideth it not, as the camel, and others, that you
shall not eat, but shall reckon it among the unclean.

<span id="an_11:5">11:5</span> The cherogrillus which cheweth the cud,
but divideth not the hoof, is unclean.

<span id="an_11:6">11:6</span> The hare also: for that too cheweth the
cud, but divideth not the hoof.

<span id="an_11:7">11:7</span> And the swine, which, though it divideth
the hoof, cheweth not the cud.

<span id="an_11:8">11:8</span> The flesh of these you shall not eat, nor
shall you touch their carcasses, because they are unclean to you.

<span id="an_11:9">11:9</span> These are the things that breed in the
waters, and which it is lawful to eat. All that hath fins, and scales,
as well in the sea, as in the rivers, and the pools, you shall eat.

<span id="an_11:10">11:10</span> But whatsoever hath not fins and
scales, of those things that move and live in the waters, shall be an
abomination to you,

<span id="an_11:11">11:11</span> And detestable : their flesh you shall
not eat, and their carcasses you shall avoid.

<span id="an_11:12">11:12</span> All that have not fins and scales, in
the waters, shall be unclean.

<span id="an_11:13">11:13</span> Of birds these are they which you must
not eat, and which are to be avoided by you: The eagle, and the griffon,
and the osprey,

<span id="an_11:14">11:14</span> And the kite, and the vulture,
according to their kind,

<span id="an_11:15">11:15</span> And all that is of the raven kind,
according to their likeness.

<span id="an_11:16">11:16</span> The ostrich, and the owl, and the
larus, and the hawk according to its kind.

<span id="an_11:17">11:17</span> The screech owl, and the cormorant, and
the ibis,

<span id="an_11:18">11:18</span> And the swan, and the bittern, and the
porphyrion,

<span id="an_11:19">11:19</span> The heron, and the charadrion according
to its kind, the houp also, and the bat.

<span id="an_11:20">11:20</span> Of things that fly, whatsoever goeth
upon four feet, shall be abominable to you.

<span id="an_11:21">11:21</span> But whatsoever walketh upon four feet,
but hath the legs behind longer, wherewith it hoppeth upon the earth,

<span id="an_11:22">11:22</span> That you shall eat, as the bruchus in
its kind, the attacus, and ophiomachus, and the locust, every one
according to their kind.

<span id="an_11:23">11:23</span> But of dying things whatsoever hath
four feet only, shall be an abomination to you:

<span id="an_11:24">11:24</span> And whosoever shall touch the carcasses
of them, shall be defiled, and shall be unclean until the evening:

<span id="an_11:25">11:25</span> And if it be necessary that he carry
any of these things when they are dead, he shall wash his clothes, and
shall be unclean until the sun set.

<span id="an_11:26">11:26</span> Every beast that hath a hoof, but
divideth it not, nor cheweth the cud, shall be unclean: and he that
toucheth it, shall be defiled.

<span id="an_11:27">11:27</span> That which walketh upon hands of all
animals which go on all four, shall be unclean: he that shall touch
their carcasses shall be defiled until evening.

<span id="an_11:28">11:28</span> And he that shall carry such carcasses,
shall wash his clothes, and shall be unclean until evening: because all
these things are unclean to you.

<span id="an_11:29">11:29</span> These also shall be reckoned among
unclean things, of all that move upon the earth, the weasel, and the
mouse, and the crocodile, every one according to their kind:

<span id="an_11:30">11:30</span> The shrew, and the chameleon, and the
stello, and the lizard, and the mole:

<span id="an_11:31">11:31</span> 31All these are unclean. He that
toucheth their carcasses shall be unclean until the evening.

<span id="an_11:32">11:32</span> And upon what thing soever any of their
carcasses shall fall, it shall be defiled, whether it be a vessel of
wood, or a garment, or skins or haircloths; or any thing in which work
is done, they shall be dipped in water, and shall be unclean until the
evening, and so afterwards shall be clean.

<span id="an_11:33">11:33</span> But an earthen vessel, into which any
of these shall fall, shall be defiled, and therefore is to be broken.

<span id="an_11:34">11:34</span> Any meat which you eat, if water from
such a vessel be poured upon it, shall be unclean; and every liquor that
is drunk out of any such vessel, shall be unclean.

<span id="an_11:35">11:35</span> And upon whatsoever thing any of these
dead beasts shall fall, it shall be unclean: whether it be oven, or pots
with feet, they shall be destroyed, and shall be unclean.

<span id="an_11:36">11:36</span> But fountains and cisterns, and all
gatherings together of waters shall be clean. He that toucheth their
carcasses shall be defiled.

<span id="an_11:37">11:37</span> If it fall upon seed corn, it shall not
defile it.

<span id="an_11:38">11:38</span> But if any man pour water upon the
seed, and afterwards it be touched by the carcasses, it shall be
forthwith defiled.

<span id="an_11:39">11:39</span> If any beast die, of which it is lawful
for you to eat, he that toucheth the carcass thereof, shall be unclean
until the evening:

<span id="an_11:40">11:40</span> And he that eateth or carrieth any
thing thereof, shall wash his clothes, and shall be unclean until the
evening.

<span id="an_11:41">11:41</span> 41All that creepeth upon the earth
shall be abominable, neither shall it be taken for meat.

<span id="an_11:42">11:42</span> Whatsoever goeth upon the breast on
four feet, or hath many feet, or traileth on the earth, you shall not
eat, because it is abominable.

<span id="an_11:43">11:43</span> Do not defile your souls, nor touch
aught thereof, lest you be unclean,

<span id="an_11:44">11:44</span> For I am the Lord your God: be holy
because I am holy. Defile not your souls by any creeping thing, that
moveth upon the earth.

<span id="an_11:45">11:45</span> For I am the Lord, who brought you out
of the land of Egypt, that I might be your God.

<span id="an_11:46">11:46</span> You shall be holy, because I am holy.
This is the law of beasts and fowls, and of every living creature that
moveth in the waters, and creepeth on the earth:

<span id="an_11:47">11:47</span> That you may know the differences of
the clean, and unclean, and know what you ought to eat, and what to
refuse.

<span id="an_12:1">12:1</span> And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:

<span id="an_12:2">12:2</span> Speak to the children of Israel, and thou
shalt say to them: If a woman having received seed shall bear a man
child, she shall be unclean seven days, according to the days of the
separation of her flowers.

<span id="an_12:3">12:3</span> And on the eighth day the infant shall be
circumcised:

<span id="an_12:4">12:4</span> But she shall remain three and thirty
days in the blood of her purification. She shall touch no holy thing,
neither shall she enter into the sanctuary, until the days of her
purification be fulfilled.

<span id="an_12:5">12:5</span> But if she shall bear a maid child, she
shall be unclean two weeks, according to the custom of her monthly
courses, and she shall remain in the blood of her purification sixty-six
days.

<span id="an_12:6">12:6</span> And when the days of her purification are
expired, for a son, or for a daughter, she shall bring to the door of
the tabernacle of the testimony, a lamb of a year old for a holocaust,
and a young pigeon or a turtle for sin, and shall deliver them to the
priest:

<span id="an_12:7">12:7</span> Who shall offer them before the Lord, and
shall pray for her, and so she shall be cleansed from the issue of her
blood. This is the law for her that beareth a man child or a maid child.

<span id="an_12:8">12:8</span> And if her hand find not sufficiency, and
she is not able to offer a lamb, she shall take two turtles, or two
young pigeons, one for a holocaust, and another for sin: and the priest
shall pray for her, and so she shall be cleansed.

<span id="an_13:1">13:1</span> And the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron,
saying:

<span id="an_13:2">13:2</span> The man in whose skin or flesh shalt
arise a different colour or a blister, or as it were something shining,
that is, the stroke of the leprosy, shall be brought to Aaron the
priest, or any one of his sons.

<span id="an_13:3">13:3</span> And if he see the leprosy in his skin,
and the hair turned white, and the place where the leprosy appears lower
than the skin and the rest of the flesh: it is the stroke of the
leprosy, and upon his judgment he shall be separated.

<span id="an_13:4">13:4</span> But if there be a shining whiteness in
the skin, and not lower than the other flesh, and the hair be of the
former colour, the priest shall shut him up seven days.

<span id="an_13:5">13:5</span> And the seventh day he shall look on him:
and if the leprosy be grown no farther, and hath not spread itself in
the skin, he shall shut him up again other seven days.

<span id="an_13:6">13:6</span> And on the seventh day, he shall look on
him: if the leprosy be somewhat obscure, and not spread in the skin, he
shall declare him clean, because it is but a scab: and the man shall
wash his clothes, and shall be clean.

<span id="an_13:7">13:7</span> But if the leprosy grow again, after he
was seen by the priest and restored to cleanness, he shall be brought to
him,

<span id="an_13:8">13:8</span> And shall be condemned of uncleanness.

<span id="an_13:9">13:9</span> If the stroke of the leprosy be in a man,
he shall be brought to the priest,

<span id="an_13:10">13:10</span> And he shall view him. And when there
shall be a white colour in the skin, and it shall have changed the look
of the hair, and the living flesh itself shall appear:

<span id="an_13:11">13:11</span> It shall be judged an inveterate
leprosy, and grown into the skin. The priest therefore shall declare him
unclean, and shall not shut him up, because he is evidently unclean.

<span id="an_13:12">13:12</span> But if the leprosy spring out running
about in the skin, and cover all the skin from the head to the feet,
whatsoever falleth under the sight of the eyes,

<span id="an_13:13">13:13</span> The priest shall view him, and shall
judge that the leprosy which he has is very clean: because it is all
turned into whiteness, and therefore the man shall be clean.

<span id="an_13:14">13:14</span> But when the live flesh shall appear in
him,

<span id="an_13:15">13:15</span> Then by the judgment of the priest he
shall be defiled, and shall be reckoned among the unclean: for live
flesh, if it be spotted with leprosy, is unclean.

<span id="an_13:16">13:16</span> And if again it be turned into
whiteness, and cover all the man,

<span id="an_13:17">13:17</span> The priest shall view him, and shall
judge him to be clean.

<span id="an_13:18">13:18</span> When also there has been an ulcer in
the flesh and the skin, and it has been healed,

<span id="an_13:19">13:19</span> And in the place of the ulcer, there
appeareth a white scar, or somewhat red, the man shall be brought to the
priest:

<span id="an_13:20">13:20</span> And when he shall see the place of the
leprosy lower than the other flesh, and the hair turned white, he shall
declare him unclean, for the plague of leprosy is broken out in the
ulcer.

<span id="an_13:21">13:21</span> But if the hair be of the former
colour, and the scar somewhat obscure, and be not lower than the flesh
that is near it, he shall shut him up seven days.

<span id="an_13:22">13:22</span> And if it spread, he shall judge him to
have the leprosy:

<span id="an_13:23">13:23</span> But if it stay in its place, it is but
the scar of an ulcer, and the man shall be clean.

<span id="an_13:24">13:24</span> The flesh also and skin that hath been
burnt, and after it is healed hath a white or a red scar,

<span id="an_13:25">13:25</span> The priest shall view it, and if he see
it turned white, and the place thereof is lower than the other skin: he
shall declare him unclean, because the evil of leprosy is broken out in
the scar.

<span id="an_13:26">13:26</span> But if the colour of the hair be not
changed, nor the blemish lower than the other flesh, and the appearance
of the leprosy be somewhat obscure, he shall shut him up seven days,

<span id="an_13:27">13:27</span> And on the seventh day he shall view
him: if the leprosy be grown farther in the skin, he shall declare him
unclean.

<span id="an_13:28">13:28</span> But if the whiteness stay in its place,
and be not very clear, it is the sore of a burning, and therefore he
shall be cleansed, because it is only the scar of a burning.

<span id="an_13:29">13:29</span> If the leprosy break out in the head or
the beard of a man or woman, the Priest shall see them,

<span id="an_13:30">13:30</span> And if the place be lower than the
other flesh, and the hair yellow, and thinner than usual: he shall
declare them unclean, because it is the leprosy of the head and the
beard;

<span id="an_13:31">13:31</span> But if he perceive the place of the
spot is equal with the flesh that is near it, and the hair black: he
shall shut him up seven days,

<span id="an_13:32">13:32</span> And on the seventh day he shall look
upon it. If the spot be not grown, and the hair keep its colour, and the
place of the blemish be even with the other flesh:

<span id="an_13:33">13:33</span> The man shall be shaven all but the
place of the spot, and he shall be shut up other seven days:

<span id="an_13:34">13:34</span> If on the seventh day the evil seem to
have stayed in its place, and not lower than the other flesh, he shall
cleanse him, and his clothes being washed he shall be clean.

<span id="an_13:35">13:35</span> But if after his cleansing the spot
spread again in the skin,

<span id="an_13:36">13:36</span> He shall seek no more whether the hair
be turned yellow, because he is evidently unclean.

<span id="an_13:37">13:37</span> But if the spot be stayed, and the hair
be black, let him know that the man is healed, and let him confidently
pronounce him clean.

<span id="an_13:38">13:38</span> If a whiteness appear in the skin of a
man or a woman,

<span id="an_13:39">13:39</span> The priest shall view them. If he find
that a darkish whiteness shineth in the skin, let him know that it is
not the leprosy, but a white blemish, and that the man is clean.

<span id="an_13:40">13:40</span> The man whose hair falleth off from his
head, he is bald and clean:

<span id="an_13:41">13:41</span> And if the hair fall from his forehead,
he is bald before and clean.

<span id="an_13:42">13:42</span> But if in the bald head or in the bald
forehead there be risen a white or reddish colour,

<span id="an_13:43">13:43</span> And the priest perceive this, he shall
condemn him undoubtedly of leprosy which is risen in the bald part.

<span id="an_13:44">13:44</span> Now whosoever shall be defiled with the
leprosy, and is separated by the judgment of the priest,

<span id="an_13:45">13:45</span> Shall have his clothes hanging loose,
his head bare, his mouth covered with a cloth, and he shall cry out that
he is defiled and unclean.

<span id="an_13:46">13:46</span> All the time that he is a leper and
unclean, he shall dwell alone without the camp.

<span id="an_13:47">13:47</span> A woollen or linen garment that shall
have the leprosy

<span id="an_13:48">13:48</span> In the warp, and the woof, or a skin.
or whatsoever is made of a skin,

<span id="an_13:49">13:49</span> If it be infected with a white or red
spot, it shall be accounted the leprosy, and shall be shewn to the
priest.

<span id="an_13:50">13:50</span> And he shall look upon it and shall
shut it up seven days:

<span id="an_13:51">13:51</span> 51And on the seventh day when he
looketh on it again, if he find that it if grown, it is a Axed leprosy:
he shall judge the garment unclean, and every thing wherein it shall be
found:

<span id="an_13:52">13:52</span> And therefore it shall be burnt with
fire.

<span id="an_13:53">13:53</span> But if he see that it is not grown,

<span id="an_13:54">13:54</span> He shall give orders, and they shall
wash that part wherein the leprosy is, and he shall shut it up other
seven days.

<span id="an_13:55">13:55</span> And when he shall see that the former
colour is not returned, nor yet the leprosy spread, he shall judge it
unclean, and shall burn it with fire, for the leprosy has taken hold of
the outside of the garment, or through the whole.

<span id="an_13:56">13:56</span> But if the place of the leprosy be
somewhat dark, after the garment is washed, he shall tear it off, and
divide it from that which is sound.

<span id="an_13:57">13:57</span> And if after this there appear in those
places that before were without spot, a flying and wandering leprosy: it
must be burnt with fire.

<span id="an_13:58">13:58</span> If it cease, he shall wash with water
the parts that are pure, the second time, and they shall be clean.

<span id="an_13:59">13:59</span> This is the law touching the leprosy of
any woollen or linen garment, either in the warp or woof, or any thing
of skins, how it ought to be cleansed, or pronounced unclean.

<span id="an_14:1">14:1</span> And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:

<span id="an_14:2">14:2</span> This is the rite of a leper, when he is
to be cleansed: he shall be brought to the priest:

<span id="an_14:3">14:3</span> Who going out of the camp when he shall
And that the leprosy is cleansed,

<span id="an_14:4">14:4</span> Shall command him that is to be purified,
to offer for himself two living sparrows, which it is lawful to eat, and
cedar wood, and scarlet, and hyssop.

<span id="an_14:5">14:5</span> And he shall command one of the sparrows
to be immolated in an earthen vessel over living waters:

<span id="an_14:6">14:6</span> But the other that is alive he shall dip,
with the cedar wood, and the scarlet and the hyssop, in the blood of the
sparrow that is immolated:

<span id="an_14:7">14:7</span> Wherewith he shall sprinkle him that is
to be cleansed seven times, that he may be rightly purified: and he
shall let go the living sparrow, that it may fly into the field.

<span id="an_14:8">14:8</span> And when the man hath washed his clothes,
he shall shave all the hair of his body, and shall be washed with water:
and being purified, he shall enter into the camp, yet so that he tarry
without his own tent seven days:

<span id="an_14:9">14:9</span> And on the seventh day he shall shave the
hair of his head, and his beard and his eyebrows, and the hair of all
his body. And having washed again his clothes, and his body,

<span id="an_14:10">14:10</span> On the eighth day he shall take two
lambs without blemish, and an ewe of a year old without blemish, and
three tenths of flour tempered with oil for a sacrifice, and a sextary
of oil apart.

<span id="an_14:11">14:11</span> And when the priest that purifieth the
man, hath presented him, and all these things before the Lord, at the
door of the tabernacle of the testimony,

<span id="an_14:12">14:12</span> He shall take a. lamb, and offer it for
a trespass offering with the sextary of oil: and having offered all
before the Lord,

<span id="an_14:13">14:13</span> He shall immolate the lamb, where the
victim for sin is wont to be immolated, and the holocaust, that is, in
the holy place: for as that which is for sin, so also the victim for a
trespass offering pertaineth to the priest: it is holy of holies.

<span id="an_14:14">14:14</span> And the priest taking of the blood of
the victim that was immolated for trespass, shall put it upon the tip of
the right ear of him that is cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right
hand and the great toe of his right foot:

<span id="an_14:15">14:15</span> And he shall pour of the sextary of oil
into his own left. hand,

<span id="an_14:16">14:16</span> And shall dip his right finger in it,
and sprinkle it before the Lord seven times.

<span id="an_14:17">14:17</span> And the rest of the oil in his left
band, he shall pour upon the tip of the right ear of him that is
cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand and the great toe of his
right foot, and upon the blood that was shed for trespass,

<span id="an_14:18">14:18</span> And upon his head.

<span id="an_14:19">14:19</span> And he shall pray for him before the
Lord, and shall offer the sacrifice for sin: then shall he immolate the
holocaust,

<span id="an_14:20">14:20</span> And put it on the altar with the
libations thereof, and the man shall be rightly cleansed.

<span id="an_14:21">14:21</span> But if he be poor, and his hand cannot
find the things aforesaid: he shall take a lamb for an offering for
trespass, that the priest may pray for him, and a tenth part of hour
tempered with oil for a sacrifice, and a sextary of oil,

<span id="an_14:22">14:22</span> And two turtles or two young pigeons,
of which one may be for sin, and the other for a holocaust:

<span id="an_14:23">14:23</span> And he shall offer them on the eighth
day of his purification to the priest, at the door of the tabernacle of
the testimony before the Lord.

<span id="an_14:24">14:24</span> And the priest receiving the lamb for
trespass, and the sextary of oil, shall elevate them together.

<span id="an_14:25">14:25</span> And the lamb being immolated, he shall
put of the blood thereof upon the tip of the right ear of him that is
cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and the great toe of his
right foot:

<span id="an_14:26">14:26</span> But he shall pour part of the oil into
his own left hand,

<span id="an_14:27">14:27</span> And dipping the finger of his right
hand in it, he shall sprinkle it seven times before the Lord:

<span id="an_14:28">14:28</span> And he shall touch the tip of the right
ear of him that is cleansed, and the thumb of his right hand and the
great toe of his right foot, in the place of the blood that was shed for
trespass.

<span id="an_14:29">14:29</span> And the other part of the oil that is
in his left hand, he shall pour upon the head of the purified person,
that he may appease the Lord for him.

<span id="an_14:30">14:30</span> And he shall offer a turtle, or young
pigeon,

<span id="an_14:31">14:31</span> One for trespass, and the other for a
holocaust, with their libations.

<span id="an_14:32">14:32</span> This is the sacrifice of a leper, that
is not able to have all things that appertain to his cleansing.

<span id="an_14:33">14:33</span> And the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron,
saying:

<span id="an_14:34">14:34</span> When you shall be come into the land of
Chanaan, which I will give you for a possession, if there be the plague
of leprosy in a house,

<span id="an_14:35">14:35</span> He whose house it is, shall go and tell
the priest, saying: It seemeth to me, that there is the plague of
leprosy in my house,

<span id="an_14:36">14:36</span> And he shall command, that they carry
forth all things out of the house, before he go into it, and see whether
it have the leprosy, lest all things become unclean that are in the
house. And after- wards he shall go in to view the leprosy of the house.

<span id="an_14:37">14:37</span> And if he see in the walls thereof as
it were little dints, disfigured with paleness or redness, and lower
than all the rest,

<span id="an_14:38">14:38</span> He shall go out of the door of the
house, and forthwith shut it up seven days,

<span id="an_14:39">14:39</span> And returning on the seventh day, he
shall look upon it. If he find that the leprosy is spread,

<span id="an_14:40">14:40</span> He shall command, that the stones
wherein the leprosy is, be taken out, and cast without the city into an
unclean place:

<span id="an_14:41">14:41</span> And that the house be scraped on the
inside round about, and the dust of the scraping be scattered without
the city into an unclean place:

<span id="an_14:42">14:42</span> And that other stones be laid in the
place of them that were taken away, and the house be plastered with
other mortar.

<span id="an_14:43">14:43</span> But if, after the stones be taken out,
and the dust scraped off, and it be plastered with other earth,

<span id="an_14:44">14:44</span> The priest going in perceive that the
leprosy is returned, and the walls full of spots, it is a lasting
leprosy, and the house is unclean:

<span id="an_14:45">14:45</span> And they shall destroy it forthwith,
and shall cast the stones and timber thereof, and all the dust without
the town into an unclean place.

<span id="an_14:46">14:46</span> He that entereth into the house when it
is shut, shall be unclean until evening,

<span id="an_14:47">14:47</span> And he that sleepeth in it, and eateth
any thing, shall wash his clothes.

<span id="an_14:48">14:48</span> But if the priest going in perceive
that the leprosy is not spread in the house, after it was plastered
again, he shall purify it, it being cured,

<span id="an_14:49">14:49</span> And for the purification thereof he
shall take two sparrows, and cedar wood, and scarlet, and hyssop:

<span id="an_14:50">14:50</span> And having immolated one sparrow In an
earthen vessel over living waters,

<span id="an_14:51">14:51</span> He shall take the cedar wood, and the
hyssop, and the scarlet, and the living sparrow, and shall dip all in
the blood of the sparrow that is immolated, and in the living water, and
he shall sprinkle the house seven times:

<span id="an_14:52">14:52</span> And shall purify it as well with the
blood of the sparrow, as with the living water, and with the living
sparrow, and with the cedar wood, and the hyssop, and the scarlet.

<span id="an_14:53">14:53</span> And when he hath let go the sparrow to
fly freely away into the field, he shall pray for the house, and it
shall be rightly cleansed.

<span id="an_14:54">14:54</span> This is the law of every kind of
leprosy and stroke.

<span id="an_14:55">14:55</span> Of the leprosy of garments and houses,

<span id="an_14:56">14:56</span> Of a scar and of blisters breaking out,
of a shining spot, and when the colours are diversely changed:

<span id="an_14:57">14:57</span> That it may be known when a thing is
clean or unclean.

<span id="an_15:1">15:1</span> And the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron,
saying:

<span id="an_15:2">15:2</span> Speak to the children of Israel, and say
to them: The man that hath an issue of seed, shall be unclean.

<span id="an_15:3">15:3</span> And then shall he be judged subject to
this evil, when a filthy humour, at every moment, cleaveth to his flesh,
and gathereth there.

<span id="an_15:4">15:4</span> Every bed on which he sleepeth, shall be

carrieth any of these things, shall wash his clothes: and being washed
with water, he shall be unclean until the evening.

<span id="an_15:11">15:11</span> Every person whom such a one shall
touch, not having washed his hands before, shall wash his clothes: and

<span id="an_15:26">15:26</span> Every bed on which she sleepeth, and
every vessel on which she sitteth, shall be defiled.

<span id="an_15:27">15:27</span> Whosoever toucheth them shall wash his
clothes: and himself being washed with water, shall be unclean until the
evening.

<span id="an_15:28">15:28</span> If the blood stop and cease to run, she
shall count seven days of her purification:

<span id="an_15:29">15:29</span> And on the eighth day she shall offer
for herself to the priest, two turtles, or two young pigeons, at the
door of the tabernacle of the testimony:

<span id="an_15:30">15:30</span> And he shall offer one for sin, and the
other for a holocaust, and he shall pray for her before the Lord, and
for the issue of her uncleanness.

<span id="an_15:31">15:31</span> You shall teach therefore the children
of Israel to take heed of uncleanness, that they may not die in their
filth, when they shall have defiled my tabernacle that is among them.

<span id="an_15:32">15:32</span> This is the law of him that hath the
issue of seed, and that is defiled by copulation.

<span id="an_15:33">15:33</span> And of the woman that is separated in
her monthly times, or that hath a continual issue of blood, and of the
man that sleepeth with her.

<span id="an_16:1">16:1</span> And the Lord spoke to Moses, after the
death of the two sons of Aaron, when they were slain upon their offering
strange fire:

<span id="an_16:2">16:2</span> And he commanded him, saying, Speak to
Aaron thy brother, that he enter not at all into the sanctuary, which is
within the veil before the propitiatory, with which the ark is covered,
lest he die, (for I will appear in a cloud over the oracle,)

<span id="an_16:3">16:3</span> Unless he first do these things: He shall
offer a calf for sin, and a ram for a holocaust.

<span id="an_16:4">16:4</span> He shall be vested with a linen tunick,
he shall cover his nakedness with linen breeches: he shall be girded
with a linen girdle, and he shall put a linen mitre upon his head: for
these are holy vestments: all which he shall put on, after he is washed.

<span id="an_16:5">16:5</span> And he shall receive from the whole
multitude of the children of Israel two buck goats for sin, and one ram
for a holocaust.

<span id="an_16:6">16:6</span> And when he hath offered the calf and
prayed for himself, and for his own house,

<span id="an_16:7">16:7</span> He shall make the two buck goats to stand
before the Lord in the door of the tabernacle of the testimony:

<span id="an_16:8">16:8</span> And casting lots upon them both, one to
be offered to the Lord, and the other to be the emissary goat:

<span id="an_16:9">16:9</span> That whose lot fell to be offered to the
Lord, he shall offer for sin:

<span id="an_16:10">16:10</span> But that whose lot was to be the
emissary goat, he shall present alive before the Lord, that he may pour
out prayers upon him, and let him go into the wilderness.

<span id="an_16:11">16:11</span> After these things are duly celebrated,
he shall offer the calf, and praying for himself and for his own house,
he shall immolate it:

<span id="an_16:12">16:12</span> And taking the censer, which he hath
filled with the burning coals of the altar, and taking up with his hand
the compounded perfume for incense, he shall go in within the veil into
the holy place:

<span id="an_16:13">16:13</span> That when the perfumes are put upon the
fire, the cloud and vapour thereof may cover the oracle, which is over
the testimony, and he may not die.

<span id="an_16:14">16:14</span> He shall take also of the blood of the
calf, and sprinkle with his finger seven times towards the propitiatory
to the east.

<span id="an_16:15">16:15</span> And when he hath killed the buck goat
for the sin of the people, he shall carry in the blood thereof within
the veil, as he was commanded to do with the blood of the calf, that he
may sprinkle it over against the oracle,

<span id="an_16:16">16:16</span> And may expiate the sanctuary from the
uncleanness of the children of Israel, and from their transgressions,
and all their sins. According to this rite shall he do to the tabernacle
of the testimony, which is fixed among them in the midst of the filth of
their habitation.

<span id="an_16:17">16:17</span> Let no man be in the tabernacle when
the high priest goeth into the sanctuary, to pray for himself and his
house, and for the whole congregation of Israel, until he come out.

<span id="an_16:18">16:18</span> And when he is come out to the altar
that is before the Lord, let him pray for himself, and taking the blood
of the calf, and of the buck goat, let him pour it upon the horns
thereof round about:

<span id="an_16:19">16:19</span> And sprinkling with his finger seven
times, let him expiate, and sanctify it from the uncleanness of the
children of Israel.

<span id="an_16:20">16:20</span> After he hath cleansed the sanctuary,
and the tabernacle, and the altar, then let him offer the living goat:

<span id="an_16:21">16:21</span> And putting both hands upon his head,
let him confess all the iniquities of the children of Israel, and all
their offences and sins: and praying that they may light on his head, he
shall turn him out by a man ready for it, into the desert.

<span id="an_16:22">16:22</span> And when the goat hath carried all
their iniquities into an uninhabited land, and shall be let go into the
desert,

<span id="an_16:23">16:23</span> Aaron shall return into the tabernacle
of the testimony, and putting off the vestments, which he had on him
before when he entered into the sanctuary, and leaving them there,

<span id="an_16:24">16:24</span> He shall wash his flesh in the holy
place, and shall put on his own garments. And after that he has come out
and hath offered his own holocaust, and that of the people, he shall
pray both for himself, and for the people:

<span id="an_16:25">16:25</span> And the fat that is offered for sins,
he shall burn upon the altar.

<span id="an_16:26">16:26</span> But he that hath let go the emissary
goat, shall wash his clothes, and his body with water, and so shall
enter into the camp.

<span id="an_16:27">16:27</span> But the calf and the buck goat, that
were sacrificed for sin, and whose blood was carried into the sanctuary,
to accomplish the atonement, they shall carry forth without the camp, e
and shall burn with fire, their skins and their flesh, and their dung:

<span id="an_16:28">16:28</span> And whosoever burneth them shall wash
his clothes, and flesh with water, and so shall enter into the camp.

<span id="an_16:29">16:29</span> And this shall be to you an everlasting
ordinance: The seventh month, the tenth day of the month, you shall
afflict your souls, and shall do no work, whether it be one of your own
country, or a stranger that sojourneth among you.

<span id="an_16:30">16:30</span> Upon this day shall be the expiation
for you, and the cleansing from all your sins: you shall be cleansed
before the Lord.

<span id="an_16:31">16:31</span> For it is a sabbath of rest, and you
shall afflict your souls by a perpetual religion.

<span id="an_16:32">16:32</span> And the priest that is anointed, and
whose hands are consecrated to do the office of the priesthood in his
father's stead, shall make atonement; and he shall be vested with the
linen robe and the holy vestments,

<span id="an_16:33">16:33</span> And he shall expiate the sanctuary and
the tabernacle of the testimony and the altar, the priest also and all
the people.

<span id="an_16:34">16:34</span> And this shall be an ordinance for
ever, that you pray for the children of Israel, and for all their sins
once in a year. He did therefore as the Lord had commanded Moses.

<span id="an_17:1">17:1</span> And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:

<span id="an_17:2">17:2</span> Speak to Aaron and his sons, and to all
the children of Israel, saying to them: This is the word, which the Lord
hath commanded, saying:

<span id="an_17:3">17:3</span> Any man whosoever of the house of Israel
if he kill an ox, or a sheep, or a goat in the camp, or without the
camp,

<span id="an_17:4">17:4</span> And offer it not at the door of the
tabernacle an oblation to the Lord, shall be guilty of blood: as if he
had shed blood, so shall he perish from the midst of his people.

<span id="an_17:5">17:5</span> Therefore the children of Israel shall
bring to the priest their victims, which they kill in the field, that
they may be sanctified to the Lord before the door of the tabernacle of
the testimony, and they may sacrifice them for peace offerings to the
Lord.

<span id="an_17:6">17:6</span> And the priest shall pour the blood upon
the altar of the Lord, at the door of the tabernacle of the testimony,
and shall burn the fat for a sweet odour to the Lord.

<span id="an_17:7">17:7</span> And they shall no more sacrifice their
victims to devils, with whom they have committed fornication. It shall
be an ordinance for ever to them and to their posterity.

<span id="an_17:8">17:8</span> And thou shalt say to them: The man of
the house of Israel, and of the strangers who sojourn among you, that
offereth a holocaust or a victim,

<span id="an_17:9">17:9</span> And bringeth it not to the door of the
tabernacle of the testimony, that it may be offered to the Lord, shall
perish from among his people.

<span id="an_17:10">17:10</span> If any man whosoever of the house of
Israel, and of the strangers that sojourn among them, eat blood, I will
set my face against his soul, and will cut him off from among his
people:

<span id="an_17:11">17:11</span> Because the life of the flesh is in the
blood: and I have given it to you, that you may make atonement with it
upon the altar for your souls, and the blood may be for an expiation of
the soul.

<span id="an_17:12">17:12</span> Therefore I have said to the children
of Israel: No soul of you, nor of the strangers that sojourn among you,
shall eat blood.

<span id="an_17:13">17:13</span> Any man whosoever of the children of
Israel, and of the strangers that sojourn among you, if by hunting or
fowling, he take a wild beast or a bird, which is lawful to eat, let him
pour out its blood, and cover it with earth.

<span id="an_17:14">17:14</span> For the life of all flesh is in the
blood: therefore I said to the children of Israel: You shall not eat the
blood of any flesh at all, because the life of the flesh is in the
blood, and whosoever eateth it, shall be cut off.

<span id="an_17:15">17:15</span> The soul that eateth that which died of
itself, or has been caught by a beast, whether he be one of your own
country or a stranger, shall wash his clothes and himself with water,
and shall be defiled until the evening: and in this manner he shall be
made clean.

<span id="an_17:16">17:16</span> But if he do not wash his clothes, and
his body, he shall bear his iniquity.

<span id="an_18:1">18:1</span> And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:

<span id="an_18:2">18:2</span> Speak to the children of Israel, and thou
shalt say to them: I am the Lord your God.

<span id="an_18:3">18:3</span> You shall not do according to the custom
of the land of Egypt, in which you dwelt: neither shall you act
according to the manner of the country of Chanaan, into which I will
bring you, nor shall you walk in their ordinances.

<span id="an_18:4">18:4</span> You shall do my judgments, and shall
observe my precepts, and shall walk in them. I am the Lord your God.

<span id="an_18:5">18:5</span> Keep my laws and my judgments, which if a
man do, he shall live in them. I am the Lord.

<span id="an_18:6">18:6</span> No man shall approach to her that is near
of kin to him, to uncover her nakedness. I am the Lord.

<span id="an_18:7">18:7</span> Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of
thy father, or the nakedness of thy mother: she is thy mother, thou
shalt not uncover her nakedness.

<span id="an_18:8">18:8</span> Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of
thy father's wife: for it is the nakedness of thy father.

<span id="an_18:9">18:9</span> Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of
thy sister by father or by mother, whether born at home or abroad.

<span id="an_18:10">18:10</span> Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of
thy son's daughter, or thy daughter's daughter: because it is thy own
nakedness.

<span id="an_18:11">18:11</span> 11Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness
of thy father's wife's daughter, whom she bore to thy father, and who is
thy sister.

<span id="an_18:12">18:12</span> Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of
thy father's sister: because she is the flesh of thy father.

<span id="an_18:13">18:13</span> Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of
thy mother's sister: because she is thy mother's flesh.

<span id="an_18:14">18:14</span> Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of
thy father's brother: neither shalt thou approach to his wife, who is
joined to thee by affinity.

<span id="an_18:15">18:15</span> Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of
thy daughter in law: because she is thy son's wife, neither shalt thou
discover her shame.

<span id="an_18:16">18:16</span> Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of
thy brother's wife: because it is the nakedness of thy brother.

<span id="an_18:17">18:17</span> Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of
thy wife and her daughter. Thou shalt not take her son's daughter or her
daughter's daughter, to discover her shame: because they are her flesh,
and such copulation is incest.

<span id="an_18:18">18:18</span> Thou shalt not take thy wife's sister
for a harlot, to rival her, neither shalt thou discover her nakedness,
while she is yet living.

<span id="an_18:19">18:19</span> Thou shalt not approach to a woman
having her flowers, neither shalt thou uncover her nakedness.

<span id="an_18:20">18:20</span> Thou shalt not lie with thy neighbour's
wife, nor be defiled with mingling of seed.

<span id="an_18:21">18:21</span> Thou shalt not give any of thy seed to
be consecrated to the idol Moloch, nor defile the name of thy God : I am
the Lord.

<span id="an_18:22">18:22</span> Thou shalt not lie with mankind as with
womankind, because it is an abomination.

<span id="an_18:23">18:23</span> Thou shalt not copulate with any beast,
neither shalt thou be defiled with it. A woman shall not lie down to a
beast, nor copulate with it: because it is a heinous crime.

<span id="an_18:24">18:24</span> Defile not yourselves with any of these
things with which all the nations have been defiled, which I will cast
out before you,

<span id="an_18:25">18:25</span> And with which the land is defiled: the
abominations of which I will visit, that it may vomit out its
inhabitants.

<span id="an_18:26">18:26</span> Keep ye my ordinances and my judgments,
and do not any of these abominations: neither any of your own nation,
nor any stranger that sojourneth among you.

<span id="an_18:27">18:27</span> For all these detestable things the
inhabitants of the land have done, that; were before you, and have
defiled it.

<span id="an_18:28">18:28</span> Beware then, lest in like manner, it
vomit you also out, if you do the like things, as it vomited out the
nation that was before you.

<span id="an_18:29">18:29</span> Every soul that shall commit any of
these abominations, shall perish from the midst of his people.

<span id="an_18:30">18:30</span> Keep my commandments. Do not the things
which they have done, that have been before you, and be not defiled
therein. I am the Lord your God.

<span id="an_19:1">19:1</span> The Lord spoke to Moses, saying:

<span id="an_19:2">19:2</span> Speak to all the congregation of the
children of Israel, and thou shalt say to them: Be ye holy, because I
the Lord your God am holy.

<span id="an_19:3">19:3</span> Let every one fear his father, and his
mother. Keep my sabbaths. I am the Lord your God.

<span id="an_19:4">19:4</span> Turn ye not to idols, nor make to
yourselves molten gods. I am the Lord your God.

<span id="an_19:5">19:5</span> If ye offer in sacrifice a peace offering
to the Lord, that he may be favourable,

<span id="an_19:6">19:6</span> You shall eat it on the same day it was
offered, and the next day: and whatsoever shall be left until the third
day, you shall burn with fire.

<span id="an_19:7">19:7</span> If after two days ally man eat thereof,
he shall be profane and guilty of impiety:

<span id="an_19:8">19:8</span> And shall bear his iniquity, because he
hath defiled the holy thing of the Lord, and that soul shall perish from
among his people.

<span id="an_19:9">19:9</span> When thou reapest the corn of thy land,
thou shalt not cut down all that is on the face of the earth to the very
ground: nor shalt thou gather the ears that remain.

<span id="an_19:10">19:10</span> Neither shalt thou gather the bunches
and grapes that fall down in thy vineyard, but shalt leave them to the
poor and the strangers to take. I am the Lord your God.

<span id="an_19:11">19:11</span> You shall not steal. You shall not lie,
neither shall any man deceive his neighbour.

<span id="an_19:12">19:12</span> Thou shalt not swear falsely by my
name, nor profane the name of thy God. I am the Lord.

<span id="an_19:13">19:13</span> Thou shalt not calumniate thy
neighbour, nor oppress him by violence. The wages of him that hath been
hired by thee shall not abide with thee until the morning.

<span id="an_19:14">19:14</span> Thou shalt not speak evil of the deaf,
nor put a stumblingblock before the blind: but thou shalt fear the Lord
thy God, because I am the Lord.

<span id="an_19:15">19:15</span> Thou shalt not do that which is unjust,
nor judge unjustly. Respect not the person of the poor, nor honour the
countenance of the mighty. But judge thy neighbour according to justice.

<span id="an_19:16">19:16</span> Thou shalt not be a detractor nor a
whisperer among the people. Thou shalt not stand against the blood of
thy neighbour. I am the Lord.

<span id="an_19:17">19:17</span> Thou shalt not hate thy brother in thy
heart, but reprove him openly, lest thou incur sin through him.

<span id="an_19:18">19:18</span> Seek not revenge, nor be mindful of the
injury of thy citizens. Thou shalt love thy friend as thyself. I am the
Lord.

<span id="an_19:19">19:19</span> Keep ye my laws. Thou shalt not make
thy cattle to gender with beasts of any other kind. Thou shalt not sow
thy field with different seeds. Thou shalt not wear a garment that is
woven of two sorts.

<span id="an_19:20">19:20</span> If a man carnally lie with a woman that
is a bondservant and marriageable, and yet not redeemed with a price,
nor made free: they both shall be scourged, and they shall not be put to
death, because she was not a free woman.

<span id="an_19:21">19:21</span> And for his trespass he shall offer a
ram to the Lord, at the door of the tabernacle of the testimony:

<span id="an_19:22">19:22</span> And the priest shall pray for him and
for his sin before the Lord, and he shall have mercy on him, and the sin
shall be forgiven.

<span id="an_19:23">19:23</span> When you shall be come into the land,
and shall have planted in it fruit trees, you shall take away the
firstfruits of them: the fruit that comes forth shall be unclean to you,
neither shall you eat of them.

<span id="an_19:24">19:24</span> But in the fourth year, all their fruit
shall be sanctified, to the praise of the Lord.

<span id="an_19:25">19:25</span> And in the fifth year you shall eat the
fruits thereof, gathering the increase thereof. I am the Lord your God.

<span id="an_19:26">19:26</span> You shall not eat with blood. You shall
not divine nor observe dreams.

<span id="an_19:27">19:27</span> Nor shall you cut your hair roundwise:
nor shave your beard.

<span id="an_19:28">19:28</span> You shall not make any cuttings in your
flesh, for the dead, neither shall you make in yourselves any figures or
marks: I am the Lord.

<span id="an_19:29">19:29</span> Make not thy daughter a common
strumpet, lest the land be defiled, and filled with wickedness.

<span id="an_19:30">19:30</span> Keep ye my sabbaths, and reverence my
sanctuary. I am the Lord.

<span id="an_19:31">19:31</span> 31Go not aside after wizards, neither
ask any thing of soothsayers, to be defiled by them: I am the Lord your
God.

<span id="an_19:32">19:32</span> Rise up before the hoary head, and
honour the person of the aged man: and fear the Lord thy God. I am the
Lord.

<span id="an_19:33">19:33</span> If a stranger dwell in your land, and
abide among you, do not upbraid him :

<span id="an_19:34">19:34</span> But let him be among you as one of the
same country: and you shall love him as yourselves: for you were
strangers in the land of Egypt. I am the Lord your God.

<span id="an_19:35">19:35</span> Do not any unjust thing in judgment, in
rule, in weight, or in measure.

<span id="an_19:36">19:36</span> Let the balance be just and the weights
equal, the bushel just, and the sextary equal. I am the Lord your God,
that brought you out of the land of Egypt.

<span id="an_19:37">19:37</span> Keep all my precepts, and all my
judgments, and do them. I am the Lord.

<span id="an_20:1">20:1</span> And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:

<span id="an_20:2">20:2</span> Thus shalt thou say to the children of
Israel: If any man of the children of Israel, or of the strangers, that
dwell in Israel, give of his seed to the idol Moloch, dying let him die:
the people of the land shall stone him.

<span id="an_20:3">20:3</span> And I will set my face against him: and I
will cut him off from the midst of his people, because he hath given of
his seed to Moloch, and hath defiled my sanctuary, and profaned my holy
name.

<span id="an_20:4">20:4</span> And if the people of the land neglecting,
and as it were little regarding my commandment, let alone the man that
hath given of his seed to Moloch, and will not kill him:

<span id="an_20:5">20:5</span> I will set my face against that man, and
his kindred, and will cut off both him and all that consented with him,
to commit fornication with Moloch, out of the midst of their people.

<span id="an_20:6">20:6</span> The soul that shall go aside after
magicians, and soothsayers, and shall commit fornication with them, I
will set my face against that soul, and destroy it out of the midst of
its people.

<span id="an_20:7">20:7</span> Sanctify yourselves, and be ye holy
because I am the Lord your God.

<span id="an_20:8">20:8</span> Keep my precepts, and do them. I am the
Lord that sanctify you.

<span id="an_20:9">20:9</span> He that curseth his father, or mother,
dying let him die: he hath cursed his father, and mother, let his blood
be upon him.

<span id="an_20:10">20:10</span> If any man commit adultery with the
wife of another, and defile his neighbour's wife, let then: be put to
death, both the adulterer and the adulteress.

law, let both die, because they have done a heinous crime: their blood
be upon them.

<span id="an_20:13">20:13</span> If any one lie with a man se with a
woman, both have committed an abomination, let them be put to death:

<span id="an_20:15">20:15</span> He that shall copulate with any beast
or cattle, dying let him die, the beast also ye shall kill.

<span id="an_20:16">20:16</span> The woman that shall lie under any
beast, shall be killed together with the same: their blood be upon them.

<span id="an_20:17">20:17</span> If any man take his sister, the
daughter of his father, or the daughter of his mother, and see her
nakedness, and she behold her brother's shame: they have committed a
crime: they shall be slain, in the sight of their people, because they
have discovered one another's nakedness, and they shall bear their
iniquity.

<span id="an_20:18">20:18</span> If any man lie with a woman in her
flowers, and uncover her nakedness, and she open the fountain of her
blood, both shall be destroyed out of the midst of their people.

<span id="an_20:19">20:19</span> Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of
thy aunt by thy mother, and of thy aunt by thy father: he that doth
this, hath uncovered the shame of his own flesh, both shall bear their
iniquity.

<span id="an_20:20">20:20</span> If any mall lie with the wife of his
uncle by the father, or of his uncle by the mother, and uncover the
shame of his near akin, both shall bear their sin: they shall die
without children.

<span id="an_20:21">20:21</span> He that marrieth his brother's wife,
doth an unlawful thing, he hath uncovered his brother's nakedness: they
shall be without children.

<span id="an_20:22">20:22</span> Keep my laws and my judgments, and do
them: lest the land into which you are to enter to dwell therein, vomit
you also out.

<span id="an_20:23">20:23</span> Walk not after the laws of the nations,
which I will cast out before you. For they have done all these things,
and therefore I abhorred them.

<span id="an_20:24">20:24</span> But to you I say: Possess their land
which I will give you for an inheritance, a land flowing with milk and
honey. I am the Lord your God, who have separated you from other people.

<span id="an_20:25">20:25</span> Therefore do you also separate the
clean beast from the unclean, and the clean fowl from the unclean:
defile not your souls with beasts, or birds, or any things that move on
the earth, and which I have shewn you to be unclean.

<span id="an_20:26">20:26</span> You shall be holy unto me, because I
the Lord am holy, and I have separated you from other people, that you
should be mine.

<span id="an_20:27">20:27</span> A man, or woman, in whom there is a
pythonical or divining spirit, dying let them die: they shall stone
them: their blood be upon them.

<span id="an_21:1">21:1</span> The Lord said also to Moses: Speak to the
priests the sons of Aaron, and thou shalt say to them: Let not a priest
incur an uncleanness at the death of his citizens:

<span id="an_21:2">21:2</span> But only for his kin, such as are near in
blood, that is to say, for his father and for his mother, and for his
son, and for his daughter, for his brother also,

<span id="an_21:3">21:3</span> And for a maiden sister, who hath had no
husband:

<span id="an_21:4">21:4</span> But not even for the prince of his people
shall he do any thing that may make him unclean.

<span id="an_21:5">21:5</span> Neither shall they shave their head, nor
their beard, nor make incisions in their flesh.

<span id="an_21:6">21:6</span> They shall be holy to their God, and
shall not profane his name: for they offer the burnt offering of the
Lord, and the bread of their God, and therefore they shall be holy.

<span id="an_21:7">21:7</span> They shall not take to wife a harlot or a
vile prostitute, nor one that has been put away from her husband:
because they are consecrated to their God,

<span id="an_21:8">21:8</span> And offer the leaves of proposition. Let
them therefore be holy, because I also am holy, the Lord, who sanctify
them.

<span id="an_21:9">21:9</span> If the daughter of a priest be taken in
whoredom, and dishonour the name of her father, she shall be burnt with
fire.

<span id="an_21:10">21:10</span> The high priest, that is to say, the
priest, is the greatest among his brethren. upon whose head the oil of
unction hath been poured, and whose hands have been consecrated for the
priesthood, and who hath been vested with the holy vestments, shall not
uncover his head, he shall not rend his garments:

<span id="an_21:11">21:11</span> Nor shall he go in at all to any dead
person: not even for his father, or his mother, shall he be defiled:

<span id="an_21:12">21:12</span> Neither shall he go out of the holy
places, lest he defile the sanctuary of the Lord, because the oil of the
holy unction of his God is upon him. I am the Lord.

<span id="an_21:13">21:13</span> He shall take a virgin unto his wife:

<span id="an_21:14">21:14</span> But a widow or one that is divorced, or
defiled, or a harlot, he shall not take, but a maid of his own people :

<span id="an_21:15">21:15</span> He shall not mingle the stock of his
kindred with the common people of his nation: for I am the Lord who
sanctify him.

<span id="an_21:16">21:16</span> And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:

<span id="an_21:17">21:17</span> Say to Aaron: Whosoever of thy seed
throughout their families, hath a blemish, he shall not offer bread to
his God.

<span id="an_21:18">21:18</span> Neither shall he approach to minister
to him: If he be blind, if he be lame, if he have a little, or a great,
or a crooked nose,

<span id="an_21:19">21:19</span> If his foot, or if his hand be broken,

<span id="an_21:20">21:20</span> If he be crookbacked, or blear eyed, or
have a pearl in his eye, or a continual scab, or a dry scurf in his
body, or a rupture:

<span id="an_21:21">21:21</span> Whosoever of the seed of Aaron the
priest hath a blemish, he shall not approach to offer sacrifices to the
Lord, nor bread to his God.

<span id="an_21:22">21:22</span> He shall eat nevertheless of the
loaves, that are offered in the sanctuary,

<span id="an_21:23">21:23</span> Yet so that he enter not within the
veil, nor approach to the altar, because he hath a blemish, and he must
not defile my sanctuary. I am the Lord who sanctify them.

<span id="an_21:24">21:24</span> Moses therefore spoke to Aaron, and to
his sons and to all Israel, all the things that had been commanded him.

<span id="an_22:1">22:1</span> And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:

<span id="an_22:2">22:2</span> Speak to Aaron and to his sons, that they
beware of those things that are consecrated of the children of Israel,
and defile not the name of the things sanctified to me, which they
offer. I am the Lord.

<span id="an_22:3">22:3</span> Say to them and to their posterity: Every
man of your race, that approacheth to those things that are consecrated,
and which the children of Israel have offered to the Lord, in whom there
is uncleanness, shall perish before the Lord. I am the Lord.

<span id="an_22:4">22:4</span> The man of the seed of Aaron, that is a
leper, or that suffereth a running of the seed, shall not eat of those
things that are sanctified to me, until he be healed. He that toucheth
any thing unclean by occasion of the dead, and he whose seed goeth from
him as in generation,

<span id="an_22:5">22:5</span> And he that toucheth a creeping thing, or
any unclean thing, the touching of which is defiling,

<span id="an_22:6">22:6</span> Shall be unclean until the evening, and
shall not eat those things that are sanctified: but when he hath washed
his flesh with water,

<span id="an_22:7">22:7</span> And the sun is down, then being purified,
he shall eat of the sanctified things, because it is his meat.

<span id="an_22:8">22:8</span> That which dieth of itself, and that
which was taken by a beast, they shall not eat, nor be defiled
therewith, I am the Lord.

<span id="an_22:9">22:9</span> Let them keep my precepts, that they may
not fall into sin, and die in the sanctuary, when they shall have
defiled it. I am the Lord who sanctify them.

<span id="an_22:10">22:10</span> No stranger shall eat of the sanctified
things: a sojourner of the priests, or a hired servant, shall not eat of
them.

<span id="an_22:11">22:11</span> But he whom the priest hath bought, and
he that is his servant, born in his house, these shall eat of them.

<span id="an_22:12">22:12</span> If the daughter of a priest be married
to any of the people, she shall not eat of those things that are
sanctified, nor of the firstfruits.

<span id="an_22:13">22:13</span> But if she be a widow, or divorced, and
having no children return to her father's house, she shall eat of her
father's meats, as she was wont to do when she was a maid, no stranger
hath leave to eat of them.

<span id="an_22:14">22:14</span> He that eateth of the sanctified things
through ignorance, shall add the fifth part with that which he ate, and
shall give it to the priest into the sanctuary.

<span id="an_22:15">22:15</span> And they shall not profane the
sanctified things of the children of Israel, which they offer to the
Lord:

<span id="an_22:16">22:16</span> Lest perhaps they bear the iniquity of
their trespass, when they shall have eaten the sanctified things. I am
the Lord who sanctify them.

<span id="an_22:17">22:17</span> And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:

<span id="an_22:18">22:18</span> Speak to Aaron, and to his sons, and to
all the children of Israel, and thou shalt say to them: The man of the
house of Israel, and of the strangers who dwell with you, that offereth
his oblation, either paying his vows, or offering of his own accord,
whatsoever it be which he presenteth for a holocaust of the Lord,

<span id="an_22:19">22:19</span> To be offered by you, it shall be a
male without blemish of the beeves, or of the sheep, or of the goats.

<span id="an_22:20">22:20</span> If it have a blemish you shall not
offer it, neither shall it be acceptable.

<span id="an_22:21">22:21</span> The man that offereth a victim of peace
offerings to the Lord, either paying his vows, or offering of his own
accord, whether of beeves or of sheep, shall offer it without blemish,
that it may be acceptable: there shall be no blemish in it.

<span id="an_22:22">22:22</span> If it be blind, or broken, or have a
scar or blisters, or a scab, or a dry scurf: you shall not offer them to
the Lord, nor burn any thing of them upon the Lord's altar.

<span id="an_22:23">22:23</span> An ox or a sheep, that hath the ear and
the tail cut off, thou mayst offer voluntarily: but a vow may not be
paid with them.

<span id="an_22:24">22:24</span> You shall not offer to the Lord any
beast that hath the testicles bruised, or crushed, or cut and taken
away: neither shall you do any such thing in your land.

<span id="an_22:25">22:25</span> You shall not offer bread to your God,
from the hand of a stranger, nor any other thing that he would give:
because they are all corrupted, and defiled: you shall not receive them.

<span id="an_22:26">22:26</span> And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:

<span id="an_22:27">22:27</span> When a bullock, or a sheep, or a goat,
is brought forth, they shall be seven days under the udder of their dam:
but the eighth day, and thenceforth, they may be offered to the Lord.

<span id="an_22:28">22:28</span> Whether it be a cow, or a sheep, they
shall not be sacrificed the same day with their young ones.

<span id="an_22:29">22:29</span> If you immolate a victim for
thanksgiving to the Lord, that he may be favourable,

<span id="an_22:30">22:30</span> You shall eat it the same day, there
shall not any of it remain until the morning of the next day. I am the
Lord.

<span id="an_22:31">22:31</span> Keep my commandments, and do them. I am
the Lord.

<span id="an_22:32">22:32</span> Profane not my holy name, that I may be
sanctified in the midst of the children of Israel. I am the Lord who
sanctify you,

<span id="an_22:33">22:33</span> And who brought you out of the land of
Egypt, that I might be your God: I am the Lord.

<span id="an_23:1">23:1</span> And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:

<span id="an_23:2">23:2</span> Speak to the children of Israel, and thou
shalt say to them: These are the feasts of the Lord, which you shall
call holy.

<span id="an_23:3">23:3</span> Six days shall ye do work: the seventh
day, because it is the rest of the sabbath, shall be called holy. You
shall do no work on that day: it is the sabbath of the Lord in all your
habitations.

<span id="an_23:4">23:4</span> These also are the holy days of the Lord,
which you must celebrate in their seasons.

<span id="an_23:5">23:5</span> The first month, the fourteenth day of
the month at evening, is the phase of the Lord:

<span id="an_23:6">23:6</span> And the fifteenth day of the same month
is the solemnity of the unleavened bread of the Lord. Seven days shall
you eat unleavened bread.

<span id="an_23:7">23:7</span> The first day shall be most solemn unto
you, and holy: you shall do no servile work therein:

<span id="an_23:8">23:8</span> But you shall offer sacrifice in fire to
the Lord seven days. And the seventh day shall be more solemn, and more
holy: and you shall do no servile work therein.

<span id="an_23:9">23:9</span> And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:

<span id="an_23:10">23:10</span> Speak to the children of Israel, and
thou shalt say to them: When you shall have entered into the land which
I will give you, and shall reap your corn, you shall bring sheaves of
ears, the firstfruits of your harvest to the priest:

<span id="an_23:11">23:11</span> Who shall lift up the shed before the
Lord, the next day after the sabbath, that it may be acceptable for you,
and shall sanctify it.

<span id="an_23:12">23:12</span> And on the same day that the sheaf is
consecrated, a lamb without blemish of the first year shall be killed
for a holocaust of the Lord.

<span id="an_23:13">23:13</span> And the libations shall be offered with
it, two tenths of hour tempered with oil for a burnt offering of the
Lord, and a most sweet odour: libations also of wine, the fourth part of
a hin.

<span id="an_23:14">23:14</span> You shall not eat either bread, or
parched corn, or frumenty of the harvest, until the day that you shall
offer thereof to your God. It is a precept for ever throughout your
generations, and all your dwellings.

<span id="an_23:15">23:15</span> You shall count therefore from the
morrow after the sabbath, wherein you offered the sheaf of the
firstfruits, seven full weeks.

<span id="an_23:16">23:16</span> Even unto the marrow after the seventh
week be expired, that is to say, fifty days, and so you shall offer a
new sacrifice to the Lord.

<span id="an_23:17">23:17</span> Out of all your dwellings, two leaves
of the firstfruits, of two tenths of flour leavened, which you shall
bake for the firstfruits of the Lord.

<span id="an_23:18">23:18</span> And you shall offer with the leaves
seven lambs without blemish of the first year, and one calf from the
herd, and two rams, and they shall be for a holocaust with their
libations far a most sweet odour to the Lord.

<span id="an_23:19">23:19</span> You shall offer also a buck goat for
sin, and two lambs of the first year for sacrifices of peace offerings.

<span id="an_23:20">23:20</span> And when the priest hath lifted them up
with the leaves of the firstfruits before the Lord, they shall fall to
his use.

<span id="an_23:21">23:21</span> And you shall call this day most
solemn, and most holy. You shall do no servile work therein. It shall be
an everlasting ordinance in all your dwellings and generations.

<span id="an_23:22">23:22</span> And when you reap the corn of your
land, you shall not cut it to the very ground: neither shall you gather
the ears that remain; but you shall leave them for the poor and for the
strangers. I am the Lord your God.

<span id="an_23:23">23:23</span> And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:

<span id="an_23:24">23:24</span> Say to the children of Israel: The
seventh month, on the first day of the month, you shall keep a sabbath,
a memorial, with she sound of trumpets, and it shall be called holy.

<span id="an_23:25">23:25</span> You shall do no servile work therein,
and you shall offer a holocaust to the Lord.

<span id="an_23:26">23:26</span> And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:

<span id="an_23:27">23:27</span> Upon the tenth day of this seventh
month shall be the day of atonement, it shall be most solemn, and shall
be called holy: and you shall afflict your souls on that day, and shall
offer a holocaust to the Lord.

<span id="an_23:28">23:28</span> You shall do no servile work in the
time of this day: because it is a day of propitiation, that the Lord
your God may be merciful unto you.

<span id="an_23:29">23:29</span> Every soul that is not afflicted on
this day, shall perish from among his people:

<span id="an_23:30">23:30</span> And every soul that shall do any work,
the same will I destroy from among his people.

<span id="an_23:31">23:31</span> You shall do no work therefore on that
day: it shall be an everlasting ordinance unto you in all your
generations, and dwellings.

<span id="an_23:32">23:32</span> It is a sabbath of rest, and you shell
afflict your souls beginning on the ninth day of the month: from evening
until evening you shall celebrate your sabbaths.

<span id="an_23:33">23:33</span> And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:

<span id="an_23:34">23:34</span> Say to the children of Israel: From the
fifteenth day of this same seventh month, shall be kept the feast of
tabernacles seven days to the Lord.

<span id="an_23:35">23:35</span> The first day shall be called most
solemn and most holy: you shall do no servile work therein. And seven
days you shall offer holocausts to the Lord.

<span id="an_23:36">23:36</span> The eighth day also shall be most
solemn and most holy, and you shall offer holocausts to the Lord: for it
is the day of assembly and congregation: you shall do no servile work
therein.

<span id="an_23:37">23:37</span> These are the feasts of the Lord, which
you shall call most solemn and most holy, and shall offer on them
oblations to the Lord, holocausts and libations according to the rite of
every day,

<span id="an_23:38">23:38</span> Besides the sabbaths of the Lord, and
your gifts, and those things that you offer by vow, or which you shall
give to the Lord voluntarily.

<span id="an_23:39">23:39</span> So from the fifteenth day of the
seventh month, when you shall have gathered in all the fruits of your
land, you shall celebrate the feast of the Lord seven days: on the first
day and the eighth shall be a sabbath, that is a day of rest.

<span id="an_23:40">23:40</span> And you shall take to you on the first
day the fruits of the fairest tree, and branches of palm trees, and
boughs of thick trees, and willows of the brook, and you shall rejoice
before the Lord your God.

<span id="an_23:41">23:41</span> And you shall keep the solemnity
thereof seven days in the year. It shall be an everlasting ordinance in
your generations. In the seventh month shall you celebrate this feast.

<span id="an_23:42">23:42</span> And you shall dwell in bowers seven
days: every one that is of the race of Israel, shall dwell in
tabernacles:

<span id="an_23:43">23:43</span> That your posterity may know, that I
made the children of Israel to dwell in tabernacles, when I brought them
out of the land of Egypt. I am the Lord your God.

<span id="an_23:44">23:44</span> And Moses spoke concerning the feasts
of the Lord to the children of Israel.

<span id="an_24:1">24:1</span> And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:

<span id="an_24:2">24:2</span> Command the children of Israel, that they
bring unto thee the finest and dearest oil of olives, to furnish the
lamps continually,

<span id="an_24:3">24:3</span> Without the veil of the testimony in the
tabernacle of the covenant. And Aaron shall set them from evening until
morning before the Lord, by a perpetual service and rite in your
generations.

<span id="an_24:4">24:4</span> They shall be set upon the most pure
candlestick before the Lord continually.

<span id="an_24:5">24:5</span> Thou shalt take also fine hour, and shalt
bake twelve leaves thereof, two tenths shall be in every loaf :

<span id="an_24:6">24:6</span> And thou shalt set them six and six one
against another upon the most clean table before the Lord:

<span id="an_24:7">24:7</span> And thou shalt put upon them the dearest
frankincense, that the bread may be for a memorial of the oblation of
the Lord.

<span id="an_24:8">24:8</span> Every sabbath they shall be changed
before the Lord, being received of the children of Israel by an
everlasting covenant:

<span id="an_24:9">24:9</span> And they shall be Aaron's and his sons',
that they may eat them in the holy place: because it is most holy of the
sacrifices of the Lord by a perpetual right.

<span id="an_24:10">24:10</span> And behold there went out the son of a
woman of Israel, whom she had of an Egyptian, among the children of
Israel, and fell at words in the camp with a man of Israel.

<span id="an_24:11">24:11</span> And when he had blasphemed the name,
and had cursed it, he was brought to Moses: (now his mother was called
Salumith, the daughter of Dabri, of the tribe of Dan:)

<span id="an_24:12">24:12</span> And they put him into prison, till they
might know what the Lord would command.

<span id="an_24:13">24:13</span> And the Lord spoke to Moses,

<span id="an_24:14">24:14</span> Saying: Bring forth the blasphemer
without the camp, and let them that heard him, put their hands upon his
head, and let all the people stone him.

<span id="an_24:15">24:15</span> And thou shalt speak to the children of
Israel: the man that curseth his God, shall bear his sin:

<span id="an_24:16">24:16</span> And he that blasphemeth the name of the
Lord, dying let him die: all the multitude shall stone him, whether he
be a native or a stranger. He that blasphemeth the name of the Lord,
dying let him die.

<span id="an_24:17">24:17</span> He that striketh and killeth a man,
dying let him die.

<span id="an_24:18">24:18</span> He that killeth a beast, shall make it
good, that is to say, shall give beast for beast.

<span id="an_24:19">24:19</span> He that giveth a blemish to any of his
neighbours: as he hath done, so shall it be done to him:

<span id="an_24:20">24:20</span> Breach for breach, eye for eye, tooth
for tooth, shall he restore. What blemish he gave, the like shall he be
compelled to suffer.

<span id="an_24:21">24:21</span> He that striketh a beast, shall render
another. He that striketh a man shall be punished.

<span id="an_24:22">24:22</span> Let there be equal judgment among you,
whether he be a stranger, or a native that offends: because I am the
Lord your God.

<span id="an_24:23">24:23</span> And Moses spoke to the children of
Israel: and they brought forth him that had blasphemed, without the
camp, and they stoned him. And the children of Israel did as the Lord
had commanded Moses.

<span id="an_25:1">25:1</span> And the Lord spoke to Moses in mount
Sinai, saying:

<span id="an_25:2">25:2</span> Speak to the children of Israel, and thou
shalt say to them: When you shall have entered into the land which I
will give you, observe the rest of the sabbath to the Lord.

<span id="an_25:3">25:3</span> Six years thou shalt sow thy field and
six years thou shalt prune thy vineyard, and shalt gather the fruits
thereof:

<span id="an_25:4">25:4</span> But in the seventh year there shall be a
sabbath to the land, of the resting of the Lord: thou shalt not sow thy
field, nor prune thy vineyard.

<span id="an_25:5">25:5</span> What the ground shall bring forth of
itself, thou shalt not reap: neither shalt thou gather the grapes of the
firstfruits as a vintage: for it is a year of rest to the land:

<span id="an_25:6">25:6</span> But they shall be unto you for meat, to
thee and to thy manservant, to thy maidservant and thy hireling, and to
the strangers that sojourn with thee:

<span id="an_25:7">25:7</span> All things that grow shall be meat to thy
beasts and to thy cattle.

<span id="an_25:8">25:8</span> Thou shalt also number to thee seven
weeks of years, that is to say, seven times seven, which together make
forty-nine years:

<span id="an_25:9">25:9</span> And thou shalt sound the trumpet in the
seventh month, the tenth day of the month, in the time of the expiation
in all your land.

<span id="an_25:10">25:10</span> And thou shalt sanctify the fiftieth
year, and shalt proclaim remission to all the inhabitants of thy land:
for it is the year of jubilee. Every man shall return to his possession,
and every one shall go back to his former family:

<span id="an_25:11">25:11</span> Because it is the jubilee and the
fiftieth year. You shall not sow, nor reap the things that grow in the
field of their own accord, neither shall you gather the firstfruits of
the vines,

<span id="an_25:12">25:12</span> Because of the sanctification of the
jubilee: but as they grow you shall presently eat them.

<span id="an_25:13">25:13</span> In the year of the jubilee all shall
return to their possessions.

<span id="an_25:14">25:14</span> When thou shalt sell any thing to thy
neighbour, or shalt buy of him; grieve not thy brother: but thou shalt
buy of him according to the number of years from the jubilee.

<span id="an_25:15">25:15</span> And he shall sell to thee according to
the computation of the fruits.

<span id="an_25:16">25:16</span> The more years remain after the
jubilee, the more shall the price increase: and the less time is
counted, so much the less shall the purchase cost. For he shall sell to
thee the time of the fruits.

<span id="an_25:17">25:17</span> Do not afflict your countrymen, but let
every one fear his God: because I am the Lord your God.

<span id="an_25:18">25:18</span> Do my precepts, and keep my judgments,
and fulfil them: that you may dwell in the land without any fear,

<span id="an_25:19">25:19</span> And the ground may yield you its
fruits, of which you may eat your fill, fearing no mall's invasion.

<span id="an_25:20">25:20</span> But if you say: What shall we eat the
seventh year, if we sow not, nor gather our fruits?

<span id="an_25:21">25:21</span> I will give you my blessing the sixth
year, and it shall yield the fruits of three years:

<span id="an_25:22">25:22</span> And the eighth year you shall sow, and
shall eat of the old fruits, until the ninth year: till new grow up, you
shall eat the old store.

<span id="an_25:23">25:23</span> The land also shall not be sold for
ever: because it is mine, and you are strangers and sojourners with me.

<span id="an_25:24">25:24</span> For which cause all the country of your
possession shall be under the condition of redemption.

<span id="an_25:25">25:25</span> If thy brother being impoverished sell
his little possession, and his kinsman will, he may redeem what he had
sold.

<span id="an_25:26">25:26</span> But if he have no kinsman, and he
himself can find the price to redeem it:

<span id="an_25:27">25:27</span> The value of the fruits shall be
counted from that time when he sold it: and the overplus he shall
restore to the buyer, and so shall receive his possession again.

<span id="an_25:28">25:28</span> But if his hands find not the means to
repay the price, the buyer shall have what he bought, until the year of
the jubilee. For in that year all that is sold shall return to the
owner, and to the ancient possessor.

<span id="an_25:29">25:29</span> He that selleth a house within the
walls of a city, shall have the liberty to redeem it, until one year be
expired:

<span id="an_25:30">25:30</span> If he redeem it not, and the whole year
be fully out, the buyer shall possess it, and his posterity for ever,
and it can- not be redeemed, not even in the jubilee.

<span id="an_25:31">25:31</span> But if the house be in a village, that
hath no walls, it shall be sold according to the same law as the fields:
if it be not redeemed before, in the jubilee it shall return to the
owner.

<span id="an_25:32">25:32</span> The houses of Levites, which are in
cities, may always be redeemed:

<span id="an_25:33">25:33</span> If they be not redeemed, in the jubilee
they shall all return to the owners, because the houses of the cities of
the Levites are for their possessions among the children of Israel.

<span id="an_25:34">25:34</span> But let not their suburbs be sold,
because it is a perpetual possession.

<span id="an_25:35">25:35</span> If thy brother be impoverished, and
weak of hand, and thou receive him as a stranger and sojourner, and he
live with thee,

<span id="an_25:36">25:36</span> Take not usury of him nor more than
thou gavest: fear thy God, that thy brother may live with thee.

<span id="an_25:37">25:37</span> Thou shalt not give him thy money upon
usury, nor exact of him any increase of fruits.

<span id="an_25:38">25:38</span> I am the Lord your God, who brought you
out of the land of Egypt, that I might give you the land of Chanaan, and
might be your God.

<span id="an_25:39">25:39</span> If thy brother constrained by poverty,
sell himself to thee, thou shalt not oppress him with the service of
bondservants:

<span id="an_25:40">25:40</span> But he shall be as a hireling, and a
sojourner: he shall work with thee until the year of the jubilee,

<span id="an_25:41">25:41</span> And afterwards he shall go out with his
children, and shall return to his kindred and to the possession of his
fathers,

<span id="an_25:42">25:42</span> For they are my servants, and I brought
them out of the land of Egypt: let them not be sold as bondmen:

<span id="an_25:43">25:43</span> Afflict him not by might, but fear thy
God.

<span id="an_25:44">25:44</span> Let your bondmen, and your bondwomen,
be of the nations that are round about you.

<span id="an_25:45">25:45</span> And of the strangers that sojourn among
you, or that were born of them in your land, these you shall have for
servants:

<span id="an_25:46">25:46</span> And by right of inheritance shall leave
them to your posterity, and shall possess them for ever. But oppress not
your brethren the children of Israel by might.

<span id="an_25:47">25:47</span> If the hand of a stranger or a
sojourner grow strong among you, and thy brother being impoverished sell
himself to him, or to any of his race:

<span id="an_25:48">25:48</span> After the sale he may be redeemed. He
that will of his brethren shall redeem him:

<span id="an_25:49">25:49</span> Either his uncle, or his uncle's son,
or his kinsman, by blood, or by affinity. But if he himself be able
also, he shall redeem himself,

<span id="an_25:50">25:50</span> Counting only the years from the time
of his selling unto the year of the jubilee: and counting the money that
he was sold for, according to the number of the years and the reckoning
of a hired servant,

<span id="an_25:51">25:51</span> If there be many years that remain
until the jubilee, according to them shall he also repay the price.

<span id="an_25:52">25:52</span> If few, he shall make the reckoning
with him according to the number of the years, and shall repay to the
buyer of what remaineth of the years,

<span id="an_25:53">25:53</span> His wages being allowed for which he
served before: he shall not afflict him violently in thy sight.

<span id="an_25:54">25:54</span> And if by these means he cannot be
redeemed, in the year of the jubilee he shall go out with his children.

<span id="an_25:55">25:55</span> For the children of Israel are my
servants, whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt.

<span id="an_26:1">26:1</span> I am the Lord your God: you shall not
make to yourselves any idol or graven thing, neither shall you erect
pillars, nor set up a remarkable stone in your land, to adore it: for I
am the Lord your God.

<span id="an_26:2">26:2</span> Keep my sabbaths, and reverence my
sanctuary: I am the Lord.

<span id="an_26:3">26:3</span> If you walk in my precepts, and keep my
commandments, and do them, I will give you rein in due seasons.

<span id="an_26:4">26:4</span> And the ground shall bring forth its
increase, and the trees shall be filled with fruit.

<span id="an_26:5">26:5</span> The threshing of your harvest shall reach
unto the vintage, and the vintage shall reach unto the sowing time: and
you shall eat your bread to the full, and dwell in your land without
fear.

<span id="an_26:6">26:6</span> I will give peace in your coasts: you
shall sleep, and there shall be none to make you afraid. I will take
away evil beasts: and the sword shall not pass through your quarters.

<span id="an_26:7">26:7</span> You shall pursue your enemies, and they
shall fall before you.

<span id="an_26:8">26:8</span> Five of yours shall pursue a hundred
others, and a hundred of you ten thousand: your enemies shall fall
before you by the sword.

<span id="an_26:9">26:9</span> I will look on you, and make you
increase: you shell be multiplied, and I will establish my covenant with
you.

<span id="an_26:10">26:10</span> You shall eat the oldest of the old
store, and, new coming on, you shall cast away the old.

<span id="an_26:11">26:11</span> I will set my tabernacle in the midst
of you, and my soul shall not cast you off.

<span id="an_26:12">26:12</span> I will walk among you, and will be your
God, and you shall be my people.

<span id="an_26:13">26:13</span> I am the Lord your God: who have
brought you out of the land of the Egyptians, that you should not serve
them, and who have broken the chains of your necks, that you might go
upright.

<span id="an_26:14">26:14</span> But if you will not hear me, nor do all
my commandments,

<span id="an_26:15">26:15</span> If you despise my laws, and contemn my
judgments so as not to do those things which are appointed by me, and to
make void my covenant:

<span id="an_26:16">26:16</span> I also will do these things to you: I
will quickly visit you with poverty, and burning heat, which shall waste
your eyes, and consume your lives. You shall sow your seed in vain,
which shall be devoured by your enemies.

<span id="an_26:17">26:17</span> I will set my face against you, and you
shall fall down before your enemies, and shall be made subject to them
that hate you, you shall flee when no man pursueth you.

<span id="an_26:18">26:18</span> But if you will not yet for all this
obey me: I will chastise you seven times more for your sins,

<span id="an_26:19">26:19</span> And I will break the pride of your
stubbornness, and I will make to you the heaven above as iron, and the
earth as brass:

<span id="an_26:20">26:20</span> Your labour shall be spent in vain, the
ground shall not bring forth her increase, nor the trees yield their
fruit.

<span id="an_26:21">26:21</span> If you walk contrary to me, and will
not hearken to me, I will bring seven times more plagues upon you for
your sins:

<span id="an_26:22">26:22</span> And I will send in upon you the beasts
of the held, to destroy you and your cattle, and make you few in number,
and that your highways may be desolate.

<span id="an_26:23">26:23</span> And if even so you will not amend, but
will walk contrary to me:

<span id="an_26:24">26:24</span> I also will walk contrary to you, and
will strike you seven times for your sins.

<span id="an_26:25">26:25</span> And I will bring in upon you the sword
that shall avenge my covenant. And when you shall flee into the cities,
I will send the pestilence in the midst of you, and you shall be
delivered into the hands of your enemies,

<span id="an_26:26">26:26</span> After I shall have broken the staff of
your bread: so that ten women shall bake your bread in one oven, and
give it out by weight: and you shall eat, and shall not be filled.

<span id="an_26:27">26:27</span> But if you will not for all this
hearken to me, but will walk against me:

<span id="an_26:28">26:28</span> I will also go against you with
opposite fury, and I will chastise you with seven plagues for your sins,

<span id="an_26:29">26:29</span> So that you shall eat the flesh of your
sons and of your daughters.

<span id="an_26:30">26:30</span> I will destroy your high places, and
break your idols. You shall fall among the ruins of your idols, and my
soul shall abhor you.

<span id="an_26:31">26:31</span> Insomuch that I will bring your cities
to be a wilderness, and I will make your sanctuaries desolate, and will
receive no more your sweet odours.

<span id="an_26:32">26:32</span> And I will destroy your land, and your
enemies shall be astonished at it, when they shall be the inhabitants
thereof.

<span id="an_26:33">26:33</span> And I will scatter you among the
Gentiles, and I will draw out the sword after you, and your land shall
be desert, and your cities destroyed.

<span id="an_26:34">26:34</span> Then shell the land enjoy her sabbaths
all the days of her desolation: when you shall be

<span id="an_26:35">26:35</span> In the enemy's land, she shall keep a
sabbath, and rest in the sabbaths of her desolation, because she did not
rest in your sabbaths when you dwelt therein.

<span id="an_26:36">26:36</span> And as to them that shall remain of you
I will send fear in their hearts in the countries of their enemies, the
sound of a flying leaf shall terrify them, and they shall flee as it
were from the sword: they shall fall, when no man pursueth them,

<span id="an_26:37">26:37</span> And they shall every one fall upon
their brethren as fleeing from wars, none of you shall dare to resist
your enemies.

<span id="an_26:38">26:38</span> You shall perish among the Gentiles,
and an enemy's land shall consume you.

<span id="an_26:39">26:39</span> And if of them also some remain, they
shall pine away in their iniquities, in the land of their enemies, and
they shall be afflicted for the sins of their fathers, and their own:

<span id="an_26:40">26:40</span> Until they confess their iniquities and
the iniquities of their ancestors, whereby they have transgressed me,
and walked contrary unto me.

<span id="an_26:41">26:41</span> Therefore I also will walk them, and
bring them into their enemies' land until their uncircumcised mind be
ashamed: then shall they pray for their sins.

<span id="an_26:42">26:42</span> And I will remember my covenant, that I
made with Jacob, and Isaac, and Abraham. I will remember also the land:

<span id="an_26:43">26:43</span> Which when she shall be left by them,
shall enjoy her sabbaths, being desolate for them. But they shall pray
for their sins, because they rejected my judgments, and despised my
laws.

<span id="an_26:44">26:44</span> And yet for all that when they were in
the land of their enemies, I did not cast them off altogether, neither
did I so despise them that they should be quite consumed, and I should
make void my covenant with them. For I am the Lord their God.

<span id="an_26:45">26:45</span> And I will remember my former covenant,
when I brought them out of the land of Egypt, in the sight of the
Gentiles, to be their God. I am the Lord. These are the judgments, and
precepts, and laws, which the Lord gave between him and the children of
Israel in mount Sinai by the hand of Moses.

<span id="an_27:1">27:1</span> And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:

<span id="an_27:2">27:2</span> Speak to the children of Israel, and thou
shalt say to them: The man that shall have made a vow, and promised his
soul to God, shall give the price according to estimation.

<span id="an_27:3">27:3</span> If it be a man from twenty years old unto
sixty years old, he shall give fifty sides of silver, after the weight
of the sanctuary:

<span id="an_27:4">27:4</span> If a woman, thirty.

<span id="an_27:5">27:5</span> But from the fifth year until the
twentieth, a man shall give twenty sicles: a woman ten.

<span id="an_27:6">27:6</span> From one month until the fifth year. for
a male shall be given five sides: for a female three.

<span id="an_27:7">27:7</span> A man that is sixty years old or upward,
shall give fifteen aisles: a woman ten.

<span id="an_27:8">27:8</span> If he be poor, and not able to pay tile
estimation, he shall stand before tile priest: and as much as he shall
value him at, and see him able to pay, so much shall he give.

<span id="an_27:9">27:9</span> But a beast that may be sacrificed to the
Lord, if ally one shall vow, shall be holy,

<span id="an_27:10">27:10</span> And cannot be changed, that is to say,
neither a better for a worse, nor a worse for a better. And if he shall
change it: both that which was changed, and that for which it was
changed, shall be consecrated to the Lord.

<span id="an_27:11">27:11</span> An unclean beast, which cannot be
sacrificed to the Lord, if my man shall vow, shall be brought before the
priest:

<span id="an_27:12">27:12</span> Who judging whether it be good or bad,
shall set the price:

<span id="an_27:13">27:13</span> Which if he that offereth it will give,
he shall add above the estimation the fifth part.

<span id="an_27:14">27:14</span> If a man shall vow his house, and
sanctify it to the Lord, the priest shall consider it, whether it be
good or bad, and it shall be sold according to the price, which he shall
appoint.

<span id="an_27:15">27:15</span> But if he that vowed, will redeem it,
he shall give the fifth part of the estimation over and above, and shall
have the house.

<span id="an_27:16">27:16</span> And if he vow the field of his
possession, and consecrate it to the Lord, the price shall be rated
according to the measure of the seed. If the ground be sowed with thirty
bushels of barley, let it be sold for fifty sides of silver.

<span id="an_27:17">27:17</span> If he vow his field immediately from
the year of jubilee that is beginning, as much as it may be worth, at so
much it shall be rated.

<span id="an_27:18">27:18</span> But if some time after, the priest
shall reckon the money according to the number of years that remain
until the jubilee, and the price shall be abated.

<span id="an_27:19">27:19</span> And if he that had vowed, will redeem
his field, he shall add the fifth part of the money of the estimation,
and shall possess it.

<span id="an_27:20">27:20</span> And if he will not redeem it, but it be
sold to any other man, he that vowed it, may not redeem it any more:

<span id="an_27:21">27:21</span> For when the day of jubilee cometh, it
shall be sanctified to the Lord, and as a possession consecrated,
pertaineth to the right of the priests.

<span id="an_27:22">27:22</span> If a field that was bought, and not of
a man's ancestors' possession, be sanctified to the Lord,

<span id="an_27:23">27:23</span> The priest shall reckon the price
according to the number of years: unto the jubilee: and he that had
vowed, shall give that to the Lord.

<span id="an_27:24">27:24</span> But in the jubilee, it shall return to
the former owner, who had sold it, and had it in the lot of his
possession.

<span id="an_27:25">27:25</span> All estimation shall be made according
to the side of the sanctuary. A sicle hath twenty obols.

<span id="an_27:26">27:26</span> The firstborn, which belong to the
Lord, no man may sanctify and vow: whether it be bullock, or sheep, they
are the Lord's.

<span id="an_27:27">27:27</span> And if it be an unclean beast, he that
offereth it shall redeem it, according to thy estimation, and shall add
the fifth part of the price. If he will not redeem it, it shall be sold
to another for how much soever it was estimated by thee.

<span id="an_27:28">27:28</span> Any thing that is devoted to the Lord,
whether it be man, or beast, or field, shall not be sold, neither may it
be redeemed. Whatsoever is once consecrated shall be holy of holies to
the Lord.

<span id="an_27:29">27:29</span> And any consecration that is offered by
man, shall not be redeemed, but dying shall die.

<span id="an_27:30">27:30</span> All tithes of the land, whether of
corn, or of the fruits of trees, are the Lord's, and are sanctified to
him.

<span id="an_27:31">27:31</span> And if any man will redeem his tithes,
he shall add the fifth part of them.

<span id="an_27:32">27:32</span> Of all the tithes of oxen, and sheep,
and goats, that pass under the shepherd's rod, every tenth that cometh
shall be sanctified to the Lord.

<span id="an_27:33">27:33</span> It shall not be chosen neither good nor
bad, neither shall it be changed for another. If any man change it: both
that which was changed, and that for which it was changed, shall be
sanctified to the Lord, and shall not be redeemed.

<span id="an_27:34">27:34</span> These are the precepts which the Lord
commanded Moses for the children of Israel in mount Sinai.
