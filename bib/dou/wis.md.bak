### Douay-Rheims Bible: Wisdom

<span id="an_1:1">1:1</span> Love justice, you that are the judges of
the earth. Think of the Lord in goodness, and seek him in simplicity of
heart.

<span id="an_1:2">1:2</span> For he is found by them that tempt him not:
and he sheweth himself to them that have faith in him.

<span id="an_1:3">1:3</span> For perverse thoughts seperate from God:
and his power, when it is tried, reproveth the unwise:

<span id="an_1:4">1:4</span> For wisdom will not enter into a malicious
soul, nor dwell in a body subject to sins.

<span id="an_1:5">1:5</span> For the Holy Spirit of discipline will flee
from the deceitful, and will withdraw himself from thoughts that are
without understanding, and he shall not abide when iniquity cometh in.

<span id="an_1:6">1:6</span> For the spirit of wisdom is benevolent, and
will not acquit the evil speaker from his lips: for God is witness of
his reins, and he is a true searcher of his heart, and a hearer of his
tongue.

<span id="an_1:7">1:7</span> For the spirit of the Lord hath filled the
whole world: and that, which containeth all things, hath knowledge of
the voice.

<span id="an_1:8">1:8</span> Therefore he that speaketh unjust things
cannot be hid, neither shall the chastising judgment pass him by.

<span id="an_1:9">1:9</span> For inquisition shall be made into the
thoughts of the ungodly: and the hearing of his words shall come to God,
to the chastising of his iniquities.

<span id="an_1:10">1:10</span> For the ear of jealousy heareth all
things, and the tumult of murmuring shall not be hid.

<span id="an_1:11">1:11</span> Keep yourselves therefore from murmuring,
which profiteth nothing, and refrain your tongue from detraction, for an
obscure speech shall not go for nought: and the mouth that belieth,
killeth the soul.

<span id="an_1:12">1:12</span> Seek not death in the error of your life,
neither procure ye destruction by the works of your hands.

<span id="an_1:13">1:13</span> For God made not death, neither hath he
pleasure in the destruction of the living.

<span id="an_1:14">1:14</span> For he created all things that they might
be: and he made the nations of the earth for health: and there is no
poison of destruction in them, nor kingdom of hell upon the earth.

<span id="an_1:15">1:15</span> For justice is perpetual and immortal.

<span id="an_1:16">1:16</span> But the wicked with works and words have
called it to them: and esteeming it a friend have fallen away, and have
made a covenant with it: because they are worthy to be of the part
thereof.

<span id="an_2:1">2:1</span> For they have said, reasoning with
themselves, but not right: The time of our life is short and tedious,
and in the end of a man there is no remedy, and no man hath been known
to have returned from hell:

<span id="an_2:2">2:2</span> For we are born of nothing, and after this
we shall be as if we had not been: for the breath in our nostrils is
smoke: and speech a spark to move our heart,

<span id="an_2:3">2:3</span> Which being put out, our body shall be
ashes, and our spirit shall be poured abroad as soft air, and our life
shall pass away as the trace of a cloud, and shall be dispersed as a
mist, which is driven away by the beams of the sun, and overpowered with
the heat thereof:

<span id="an_2:4">2:4</span> And our name in time shall be forgotten,
and no man shall have any remembrance of our works.

<span id="an_2:5">2:5</span> For our time is as the passing of a shadow,
and there is no going back of our end: for it is fast sealed, and no man
returneth.

<span id="an_2:6">2:6</span> Come therefore, and let us enjoy the good
things that are present, and let us speedily use the creatures as in
youth.

<span id="an_2:7">2:7</span> Let us fill ourselves with costly wine, and
ointments: and let not the flower of the time pass by us.

<span id="an_2:8">2:8</span> Let us crown ourselves with roses, before
they be withered: let no meadow escape our riot.

<span id="an_2:9">2:9</span> Let none of us go without his part in
luxury: let us everywhere leave tokens of joy: for this is our portion,
and this our lot.

<span id="an_2:10">2:10</span> Let us oppress the poor just man, and not
spare the widow, nor honour the ancient grey hairs of the aged.

<span id="an_2:11">2:11</span> But let our strength be the law of
justice: for that which is feeble, is found to be nothing worth.

<span id="an_2:12">2:12</span> Let us therefore lie in wait for the
just, because he is not for our turn, and he is contrary to our doings,
and upbraideth us with transgressions of the law, and divulgeth against
us the sins of our way of life.

<span id="an_2:13">2:13</span> He boasteth that he hath the knowledge of
God, and calleth himself the son of God.

<span id="an_2:14">2:14</span> He is become a censurer of our thoughts.

<span id="an_2:15">2:15</span> He is grievous unto us, even to behold:
for his life is not like other men's, and his ways are very different.

<span id="an_2:16">2:16</span> We are esteemed by him as triflers, and
he abstaineth from our ways as from filthiness, and he preferreth the
latter end of the just, and glorieth that he hath God for his father.

<span id="an_2:17">2:17</span> Let us see then if his words be true, and
let us prove what shall happen to him, and we shall know what his end
shall be.

<span id="an_2:18">2:18</span> For if he be the true son of God, he will
defend him, and will deliver him from the hands of his enemies.

<span id="an_2:19">2:19</span> Let us examine him by outrages and
tortures, that we may know his meekness and try his patience.

<span id="an_2:20">2:20</span> Let us condemn him to a most shameful
death: for there shall be respect had unto him by his words.

<span id="an_2:21">2:21</span> These things they thought, and were
deceived: for their own malice blinded them.

<span id="an_2:22">2:22</span> And they knew not the secrets of God, nor
hoped for the wages of justice, nor esteemed the honour of holy souls.

<span id="an_2:23">2:23</span> For God created man incorruptible, and to
the image of his own likeness he made him.

<span id="an_2:24">2:24</span> But by the envy of the devil, death came
into the world:

<span id="an_2:25">2:25</span> And they follow him that are of his side.

<span id="an_3:1">3:1</span> But the souls of the just are in the hand
of God, and the torment of death shall not touch them.

<span id="an_3:2">3:2</span> In the sight of the unwise they seemed to
die: and their departure was taken for misery:

<span id="an_3:3">3:3</span> And their going away from us, for utter
destruction: but they are in peace.

<span id="an_3:4">3:4</span> And though in the sight of men they
suffered torments, their hope is full of immortality.

<span id="an_3:5">3:5</span> Afflicted in few things, in many they shall
be well rewarded: because God hath tried them, and found them worthy of
himself.

<span id="an_3:6">3:6</span> As gold in the furnace he hath proved them,
and as a victim of a holocaust he hath received them, and in time there
shall be respect had to them.

<span id="an_3:7">3:7</span> The just shall shine, and shall run to and
fro like sparks among the reeds.

<span id="an_3:8">3:8</span> They shall judge nations, and rule over
people, and their Lord shall reign for ever.

<span id="an_3:9">3:9</span> They that trust in him, shall understand
the truth: and they that are faithful in love shall rest in him: for
grace and peace is to his elect.

<span id="an_3:10">3:10</span> But the wicked shall be punished
according to their own devices: who have neglected the just, and have
revolted from the Lord.

<span id="an_3:11">3:11</span> For he that rejecteth wisdom, and
discipline, is unhappy: and their hope is vain, and their labours
without fruit, and their works unprofitable.

<span id="an_3:12">3:12</span> Their wives are foolish, and their
children wicked.

<span id="an_3:13">3:13</span> Their offspring is cursed: for happy is
the barren: and the undefiled, that hath not known bed in sin: she shall
have fruit in the visitation of holy souls.

<span id="an_3:14">3:14</span> And the eunuch, that hath not wrought
iniquity with his hands, nor thought wicked things against God: for the
precious gift of faith shall be given to him, and a most acceptable lot
in the temple of God.

<span id="an_3:15">3:15</span> For the fruit of good labours is
glorious, and the root of wisdom never faileth.

<span id="an_3:16">3:16</span> But the children of adulterers shall not
come to perfection, and the seed of the unlawful bed shall be rooted
out.

<span id="an_3:17">3:17</span> And if they live long, they shall be
nothing regarded, and their last old age shall be without honour.

<span id="an_3:18">3:18</span> And if they die quickly, they shall have
no hope, nor speech of comfort in the day of trial.

<span id="an_3:19">3:19</span> For dreadful are the ends of a wicked
race.

<span id="an_4:1">4:1</span> O how beautiful is the chaste generation
with glory: for the memory thereof is immortal: because it is known both
with God and with men.

<span id="an_4:2">4:2</span> When it is present, they imitate it: and
they desire it when it hath withdrawn itself, and it triumpheth crowned
for ever, winning the reward of undefiled conflicts.

<span id="an_4:3">4:3</span> But the multiplied brood of the wicked
shall not thrive, and bastard slips shall not take deep root, nor any
fast foundation.

<span id="an_4:4">4:4</span> And if they flourish in branches for a
time, yet standing not fast, they shall be shaken with the wind, and
through the force of winds they shall be rooted out.

<span id="an_4:5">4:5</span> For the branches not being perfect, shall
be broken, and their fruits shall be unprofitable, and sour to eat, and
fit for nothing.

<span id="an_4:6">4:6</span> For the children that are born of unlawful
beds, are witnesses of wickedness against their parents in their trial.

<span id="an_4:7">4:7</span> But the just man, if he be prevented with
death, shall be in rest.

<span id="an_4:8">4:8</span> For venerable old age is not that of long
time, nor counted by the number of years: but the understanding of a man
is grey hairs.

<span id="an_4:9">4:9</span> And a spotless life is old age.

<span id="an_4:10">4:10</span> He pleased God and was beloved, and
living among sinners he was translated.

<span id="an_4:11">4:11</span> He was taken away lest wickedness should
alter his understanding, or deceit beguile his soul.

<span id="an_4:12">4:12</span> For the bewitching of vanity obscureth
good things, and the wandering of concupiscence overturneth the innocent
mind.

<span id="an_4:13">4:13</span> Being made perfect in a short space, he
fulfilled a long time:

<span id="an_4:14">4:14</span> For his soul pleased God: therefore he
hastened to bring him out of the midst of iniquities: but the people see
this, and understand not, nor lay up such things in their hearts:

<span id="an_4:15">4:15</span> That the grace of God, and his mercy is
with his saints, and that he hath respect to his chosen.

<span id="an_4:16">4:16</span> But the just that is dead, condemneth the
wicked that are living, and youth soon ended, the long life of the
unjust.

<span id="an_4:17">4:17</span> For they shall see the end of the wise
man, and shall not understand what God hath designed for him, and why
the Lord hath set him in safety.

<span id="an_4:18">4:18</span> They shall see him, and shall despise
him: but the Lord shall laugh them to scorn.

<span id="an_4:19">4:19</span> And they shall fall after this without
honour, and be a reproach among the dead for ever: for he shall burst
them puffed up and speechless, and shall shake them from the
foundations, and they shall be utterly laid waste: they shall be in
sorrow, and their memory shall perish.

<span id="an_4:20">4:20</span> They shall come with fear at the thought
of their sins, and their iniquities shall stand against them to convict
them.

<span id="an_5:1">5:1</span> Then shall the just stand with great
constancy against those that have afflicted them, and taken away their
labours.

<span id="an_5:2">5:2</span> These seeing it, shall be troubled with
terrible fear, and shall be amazed at the suddenness of their unexpected
salvation.

<span id="an_5:3">5:3</span> Saying within themselves, repenting, and
groaning for anguish of spirit: These are they, whom we had some time in
derision, and for a parable of reproach.

<span id="an_5:4">5:4</span> We fools esteemed their life madness, and
their end without honour.

<span id="an_5:5">5:5</span> Behold how they are numbered among the
children of God, and their lot is among the saints.

<span id="an_5:6">5:6</span> Therefore we have erred from the way of
truth, and the light of justice hath not shined unto us, and the sun of
understanding hath not risen upon us.

<span id="an_5:7">5:7</span> We wearied ourselves in the way of iniquity
and destruction, and have walked through hard ways, but the way of the
Lord we have not known.

<span id="an_5:8">5:8</span> What hath pride profited us? or what
advantage hath the boasting of riches brought us?

<span id="an_5:9">5:9</span> All those things are passed away like a
shadow, and like a post that runneth on,

<span id="an_5:10">5:10</span> And as a ship that passeth through the
waves: whereof when it is gone by, the trace cannot be found, nor the
path of its keel in the waters:

<span id="an_5:11">5:11</span> Or as when a bird flieth through the air,
of the passage of which no mark can be found, but only the sound of the
wings beating the light air, and parting it by the force of her flight;
she moved her wings, and hath flown through, and there is no mark found
afterwards of her way:

<span id="an_5:12">5:12</span> Or as when an arrow is shot at a mark,
the divided air presently cometh together again, so that the passage
thereof is not known:

<span id="an_5:13">5:13</span> So we also being born, forthwith ceased
to be: and have been able to shew no mark of virtue: but are consumed in
our wickedness.

<span id="an_5:14">5:14</span> Such things as these the sinners said in
hell:

<span id="an_5:15">5:15</span> For the hope of the wicked is as dust,
which is blown away with the wind, and as a thin froth which is
dispersed by the storm: and a smoke that is scattered abroad by the
wind: and as the remembrance of a guest of one day that passeth by.

<span id="an_5:16">5:16</span> But the just shall live for evermore: and
their reward is with the Lord, and the care of them with the most High.

<span id="an_5:17">5:17</span> Therefore shall they receive a kingdom of
glory, and a crown of beauty at the hand of the Lord: for with his right
hand he will cover them, and with his holy arm he will defend them.

<span id="an_5:18">5:18</span> And his zeal will take armour, and he
will arm the creature for the revenge of his enemies.

<span id="an_5:19">5:19</span> He will put on justice as a breastplate,
and will take true judgment instead of a helmet.

<span id="an_5:20">5:20</span> He will take equity for an invincible
shield:

<span id="an_5:21">5:21</span> And he will sharpen his severe wrath for
a spear, and the whole world shall fight with him against the unwise.

<span id="an_5:22">5:22</span> Then shafts of lightning shall go
directly from the clouds, as from a bow well bent, they shall be shot
out, and shall fly to the mark.

<span id="an_5:23">5:23</span> And thick hail shall be cast upon them
from the stone casting wrath: the water of the sea shall rage against
them, and the rivers shall run together in a terrible manner.

<span id="an_5:24">5:24</span> A mighty wind shall stand up against
them, and as a whirlwind shall divide them: and their iniquity shall
bring all the earth to a desert, and wickedness shall overthrow the
thrones of the mighty.

<span id="an_6:1">6:1</span> Wisdom is better than strength, and a wise
man is better than a strong man.

<span id="an_6:2">6:2</span> Hear therefore, ye kings, and understand:
learn, ye that are judges of the ends of the earth.

<span id="an_6:3">6:3</span> Give ear, you that rule the people, and
that please yourselves in multitudes of nations:

<span id="an_6:4">6:4</span> For power is given you by the Lord, and
strength by the most High, who will examine your works, and search out
your thoughts:

<span id="an_6:5">6:5</span> Because being ministers of his kingdom, you
have not judged rightly, nor kept the law of justice, nor walked
according to the will of God.

<span id="an_6:6">6:6</span> Horribly and speedily will he appear to
you: for a most severe judgment shall be for them that bear rule.

<span id="an_6:7">6:7</span> For to him that is little, mercy is
granted: but the mighty shall be mightily tormented.

<span id="an_6:8">6:8</span> For God will not except any man's person,
neither will he stand in awe of any man's greatness: for he made the
little and the great, and he hath equally care of all.

<span id="an_6:9">6:9</span> But a greater punishment is ready for the
more mighty.

<span id="an_6:10">6:10</span> To you, therefore, O kings, are these my
words, that you may learn wisdom, and not fall from it.

<span id="an_6:11">6:11</span> For they that have kept just things
justly, shall be justified: and they that have learned these things,
shall find what to answer.

<span id="an_6:12">6:12</span> Covet ye therefore my words, and love
them, and you shall have instruction.

<span id="an_6:13">6:13</span> Wisdom is glorious, and never fadeth
away, and is easily seen by them that love her, and is found by them
that seek her.

<span id="an_6:14">6:14</span> She preventeth them that covet her, so
that she first sheweth herself unto them.

<span id="an_6:15">6:15</span> He that awaketh early to seek her, shall
not labour: for he shall find her sitting at his door.

<span id="an_6:16">6:16</span> To think therefore upon her, is perfect
understanding: and he that watcheth for her, shall quickly be secure.

<span id="an_6:17">6:17</span> For she goeth about seeking such as are
worthy of her, and she sheweth herself to them cheerfully in the ways,
and meeteth them with all providence.

<span id="an_6:18">6:18</span> For the beginning of her is the most true
desire of discipline.

<span id="an_6:19">6:19</span> And the care of discipline is love: and
love is the keeping of her laws: and the keeping of her laws is the firm
foundation of incorruption:

<span id="an_6:20">6:20</span> And incorruption bringeth near to God.

<span id="an_6:21">6:21</span> Therefore the desire of wisdom bringeth
to the everlasting kingdom.

<span id="an_6:22">6:22</span> If then your delight be in thrones, and
sceptres, O ye kings of the people, love wisdom, that you may reign for
ever.

<span id="an_6:23">6:23</span> Love the light of wisdom, all ye that
bear rule over peoples.

<span id="an_6:24">6:24</span> Now what wisdom is, and what was her
origin, I will declare: and I will not hide from you the mysteries of
God, but will seek her out from the beginning of her birth, and bring
the knowledge of her to light, and will not pass over the truth:

<span id="an_6:25">6:25</span> Neither will I go with consuming envy:
for such a man shall not be partaker of wisdom.

<span id="an_6:26">6:26</span> Now the multitude of the wise is the
welfare of the whole world: and a wise king is the upholding of the
people.

<span id="an_6:27">6:27</span> Receive therefore instruction by my
words, and it shall be profitable to you.

<span id="an_7:1">7:1</span> I myself also am a mortal man, like all
others, and of the race of him, that was first made of the earth, and in
the womb of my mother I was fashioned to be flesh.

<span id="an_7:2">7:2</span> In the time of ten months I was compacted
in blood, of the seed of man, and the pleasure of sleep concurring.

<span id="an_7:3">7:3</span> And being born I drew in the common air,
and fell upon the earth, that is made alike, and the first voice which I
uttered was crying, as all others do.

<span id="an_7:4">7:4</span> I was nursed in swaddling clothes, and with
great cares.

<span id="an_7:5">7:5</span> For none of the kings had any other
beginning of birth.

<span id="an_7:6">7:6</span> For all men have one entrance into life,
and the like going out.

<span id="an_7:7">7:7</span> Wherefore I wished, and understanding was
given me: and I called upon God, and the spirit of wisdom came upon me:

<span id="an_7:8">7:8</span> And I preferred her before kingdoms and
thrones, and esteemed riches nothing in comparison of her.

<span id="an_7:9">7:9</span> Neither did I compare unto her any precious
stone: for all gold in comparison of her, is as a little sand, and
silver in respect to her shall be counted as clay.

<span id="an_7:10">7:10</span> I loved her above health and beauty, and
chose to have her instead of light: for her light cannot be put out.

<span id="an_7:11">7:11</span> Now all good things came to me together
with her, and innumerable riches through her hands,

<span id="an_7:12">7:12</span> And I rejoiced in all these: for this
wisdom went before me, and I knew not that she was the mother of them
all.

<span id="an_7:13">7:13</span> Which I have learned without guile, and
communicate without envy, and her riches I hide not.

<span id="an_7:14">7:14</span> For she is an infinite treasure to men!
which they that use, become the friends of God, being commended for the
gift of discipline.

<span id="an_7:15">7:15</span> And God hath given to me to speak as I
would, and to conceive thoughts worthy of those things that are given
me: because he is the guide of wisdom, and the director of the wise:

<span id="an_7:16">7:16</span> For in his hand are both we, and our
words, and all wisdom, and the knowledge and skill of works.

<span id="an_7:17">7:17</span> For he hath given me the true knowledge
of the things that are: to know the disposition of the whole world, and
the virtues of the elements,

<span id="an_7:18">7:18</span> The beginning, and ending, and midst of
the times, the alterations of their courses, and the changes of seasons,

<span id="an_7:19">7:19</span> The revolutions of the year, and the
dispositions of the stars,

<span id="an_7:20">7:20</span> The natures of living creatures, and rage
of wild beasts, the force of winds, and reasonings of men, the
diversities of plants, and the virtues of roots,

<span id="an_7:21">7:21</span> And all such things as are hid and not
foreseen, I have learned: for wisdom, which is the worker of all things,
taught me.

<span id="an_7:22">7:22</span> For in her is the spirit of
understanding: holy, one, manifold, subtile, eloquent, active,
undefiled, sure, sweet, loving that which is good, quick, which nothing
hindereth, beneficent,

<span id="an_7:23">7:23</span> Gentle, kind, steadfast, assured, secure,
having all power, overseeing all things, and containing all spirits,
intelligible, pure, subtile.

<span id="an_7:24">7:24</span> For wisdom is more active than all active
things: and reacheth everywhere by reason of her purity.

<span id="an_7:25">7:25</span> For she is a vapour of the power of God,
and a certain pure emanation of the glory of the almighty God: and
therefore no defiled thing cometh into her.

<span id="an_7:26">7:26</span> For she is the brightness of eternal
light, and the unspotted mirror of God's majesty, and the image of his
goodness.

<span id="an_7:27">7:27</span> And being but one, she can do all things:
and remaining in herself the same, she reneweth all things, and through
nations conveyeth herself into holy souls, she maketh the friends of God
and prophets.

<span id="an_7:28">7:28</span> For God loveth none but him that dwelleth
with wisdom.

<span id="an_7:29">7:29</span> For she is more beautiful than the sun,
and above all the order of the stars: being compared with the light, she
is found before it.

<span id="an_7:30">7:30</span> For after this cometh night, but no evil
can overcome wisdom.

<span id="an_8:1">8:1</span> She reacheth therefore from end to end
mightily, and ordereth all things sweetly.

<span id="an_8:2">8:2</span> Her have I loved, and have sought her out
from my youth, and have desired to take her for my spouse, and I became
a lover of her beauty.

<span id="an_8:3">8:3</span> She glorifieth her nobility by being
conversant with God: yea and the Lord of all things hath loved her.

<span id="an_8:4">8:4</span> For it is she that teacheth the knowledge
of God, and is the chooser of his works.

<span id="an_8:5">8:5</span> And if riches be desired in life, what is
richer than wisdom, which maketh all things?

<span id="an_8:6">8:6</span> And if sense do work: who is a more artful
worker than she of those things that are?

<span id="an_8:7">8:7</span> And if a man love justice: her labours have
great virtues; for she teacheth temperance, and prudence, anad justice,
and fortitude, which are such things as men can have nothing more
profitable in life.

<span id="an_8:8">8:8</span> And if a man desire much knowledge: she
knoweth things past, and judgeth of things to come: she knoweth the
subtilties of speeches, and the solutions of arguments: she knoweth
signs and wonders before they be done, and the events of times and ages.

<span id="an_8:9">8:9</span> I purposed therefore to take her to me to
live with me: knowing that she will communicate to me of her good
things, and will be a comfort in my cares and grief.

<span id="an_8:10">8:10</span> For her sake I shall have glory among the
multitude, and honour with the ancients, though I be young:

<span id="an_8:11">8:11</span> And I shall be found of a quick conceit
in judgment, and shall be admired in the sight of the mighty, and the
faces of princes shall wonder at me.

<span id="an_8:12">8:12</span> They shall wait for me when I hold my
peace, and they shall look upon me when I speak, and if I talk much they
shall lay their hands on their mouths.

<span id="an_8:13">8:13</span> Moreover by the means of her I shall have
immortality: and shall leave behind me an everlasting memory to them
that come after me.

<span id="an_8:14">8:14</span> I shall set the people in order: and
nations shall be subject to me.

<span id="an_8:15">8:15</span> Terrible kings hearing shall be afraid of
me: among the multitude I shall be found good, and valiant in war.

<span id="an_8:16">8:16</span> When I go into my house, I shall repose
myself with her: for her conversation hath no bitterness, nor her
company any tediousness, but joy and gladness.

<span id="an_8:17">8:17</span> Thinking these things with myself, and
pondering them in my heart, that to be allied to wisdom is immortality,

<span id="an_8:18">8:18</span> And that there is great delight in her
friendship, and inexhaustible riches in the works of her hands, and in
the exercise of conference with her, wisdom, and glory in the
communication of her words: I went about seeking, that I might take her
to myself.

<span id="an_8:19">8:19</span> And I was a witty child and had received
a good soul.

<span id="an_8:20">8:20</span> And whereas I was more good, I came to a
body undefiled.

<span id="an_8:21">8:21</span> And as I knew that I could not otherwise
be continent, except God gave it, and this also was a point of wisdom,
to know whose gift it was: I went to the Lord, and besought him, and
said with my whole heart:

<span id="an_9:1">9:1</span> God of my fathers, and Lord of mercy, who
hast made all things with thy word,

<span id="an_9:2">9:2</span> And by thy wisdom hast appointed man, that
he should have dominion over the creature that was made by thee,

<span id="an_9:3">9:3</span> That he should order the world according to
equity and justice, and execute justice with an upright heart:

<span id="an_9:4">9:4</span> Give me wisdom, that sitteth by thy throne,
and cast me not off from among thy children:

<span id="an_9:5">9:5</span> For I am thy servant, and the son of thy
handmaid, a weak man, and of short time, and falling short of the
understanding of judgment and laws.

<span id="an_9:6">9:6</span> For if one be perfect among the children of
men, yet if thy wisdom be not with him, he shall be nothing regarded.

<span id="an_9:7">9:7</span> Thou hast chosen me to be king of thy
people, and a judge of thy sons and daughters.

<span id="an_9:8">9:8</span> And hast commanded me to build a temple on
thy holy mount, and an altar in the city of thy dwelling place, a
resemblance of thy holy tabernacle, which thou hast prepared from the
beginning:

<span id="an_9:9">9:9</span> And thy wisdom with thee, which knoweth thy
works, which then also was present when thou madest the world, and knew
what was agreeable to thy eyes, and what was right in thy commandments.

<span id="an_9:10">9:10</span> Send her out of thy holy heaven, and from
the throne of thy majesty, that she may be with me, and may labour with
me, that I may know what is acceptable with thee:

<span id="an_9:11">9:11</span> For she knoweth and understandeth all
things, and shall lead me soberly in my works, and shall preserve me by
her power.

<span id="an_9:12">9:12</span> So shall my works be acceptable, and I
shall govern thy people justly, and shall be worthy of the throne of my
father.

<span id="an_9:13">9:13</span> For who among men is he that can know the
counsel of God? or who can think what the will of God is?

<span id="an_9:14">9:14</span> For the thoughts of mortal men are
fearful, and our counsels uncertain.

<span id="an_9:15">9:15</span> For the corruptible body is a load upon
the soul, and the earthly habitation presseth down the mind that museth
upon many things.

<span id="an_9:16">9:16</span> And hardly do we guess aright at things
that are upon earth: and with labour do we find the things that are
before us. But the things that are in heaven, who shall search out?

<span id="an_9:17">9:17</span> And who shall know thy thought, except
thou give wisdom, and send thy Holy Spirit from above:

<span id="an_9:18">9:18</span> And so the ways of them that are upon
earth may be corrected, and men may learn the things that please thee?

<span id="an_9:19">9:19</span> For by wisdom they were healed, whosoever
have pleased thee, O Lord, from the beginning.

<span id="an_10:1">10:1</span> She preseved him, that was first formed
by God the father of the world, when he was created alone,

<span id="an_10:2">10:2</span> And she brought him out of his sin, and
gave him power to govern all things.

<span id="an_10:3">10:3</span> But when the unjust went away from her in
his anger, he perished by the fury wherewith he murdered his brother.

<span id="an_10:4">10:4</span> For whose cause, when water destroyed the
earth, wisdom healed it again, directing the course of the just by
contemptible wood.

<span id="an_10:5">10:5</span> Moreover when the nations had conspired
together to consent to wickedness, she knew the just, and preserved him
without blame to God, and kept him strong against the compassion for his
son.

<span id="an_10:6">10:6</span> She delivered the just man who fled from
the wicked that were perishing, when the fire came down upon Pentapolis:

<span id="an_10:7">10:7</span> Whose land for a testimony of their
wickedness is desolate, and smoketh to this day, and the trees bear
fruits that ripen not, and a standing pillar of salt is a monument of an
incredulous soul.

<span id="an_10:8">10:8</span> For regarding not wisdom, they did not
only slip in this, that they were ignorant of good things, but they left
also unto men a memorial of their folly, so that in the things in which
they sinned, they could not so much as lie hid.

<span id="an_10:9">10:9</span> But wisdom hath delivered from sorrow
them that attend upon her.

<span id="an_10:10">10:10</span> She conducted the just, when he fled
from his brother's wrath, through the right ways, and shewed him the
kingdom of God, and gave him the knowledge of the holy things, made him
honourable in his labours, and accomplished his labours.

<span id="an_10:11">10:11</span> In the deceit of them that overreached
him, she stood by him, and made him honourable.

<span id="an_10:12">10:12</span> She kept him safe from his enemies, and
she defended him from seducers, and gave him a strong conflict, that he
might overcome, and know that wisdom is mightier than all.

<span id="an_10:13">10:13</span> She forsook not the just when he was
sold, but delivered him from sinners: she went down with him into the
pit.

<span id="an_10:14">10:14</span> And in bands she left him not, till she
brought him the sceptre of the kingdom, and power against those that
oppressed him: and shewed them to be liars that had accused him, and
gave him everlasting glory.

<span id="an_10:15">10:15</span> She delivered the just people, and
blameless seed from the nations that oppressed them.

<span id="an_10:16">10:16</span> She entered into the soul of the
servant of God, and stood against dreadful kings in wonders and signs.

<span id="an_10:17">10:17</span> And she rendered to the just the wages
of their labours, and conducted them in a wonderful way: and she was to
them for a covert by day, and for the light of stars by night:

<span id="an_10:18">10:18</span> And she brought them through the Red
Sea, and carried them over through a great water.

<span id="an_10:19">10:19</span> But their enemies she drowned in the
sea, and from the depth of hell she brought them out. Therefore the just
took the spoils of the wicked.

<span id="an_10:20">10:20</span> And they sung to thy holy name, O Lord,
and they praised with one accord thy victorious hand.

<span id="an_10:21">10:21</span> For wisdom opened the mouth of the
dumb, and made the tongues of infants eloquent.

<span id="an_11:1">11:1</span> She prospered their works in the hands of
the holy prophet.

<span id="an_11:2">11:2</span> They went through wildernesses that were
not inhabited, and in desert places they pitched their tents.

<span id="an_11:3">11:3</span> They stood against their enemies, and
revenged themselves of their adversaries.

<span id="an_11:4">11:4</span> They were thirsty, and they called upon
thee, and water was given them out of the high rock, and a refreshment
of their thirst out of the hard stone.

<span id="an_11:5">11:5</span> For by what things their enemies were
punished, when their drink failed them, while the children of Israel
abounded therewith and rejoiced:

<span id="an_11:6">11:6</span> By the same things they in their need
were benefited.

<span id="an_11:7">11:7</span> For instead of a fountain of an ever
running river, thou gavest human blood to the unjust.

<span id="an_11:8">11:8</span> And whilst they were diminished for a
manifest reproof of their murdering the infants, thou gavest to thine
abundant water unlooked for:

<span id="an_11:9">11:9</span> Shewing by the thirst that was then, how
thou didst exalt thine, and didst kill their adversaries.

<span id="an_11:10">11:10</span> For when they were tried, and chastised
with mercy, they knew how the wicked were judged with wrath and
tormented.

<span id="an_11:11">11:11</span> For thou didst admonish and try them as
a father: but the others, as a severe king, thou didst examine and
condemn.

<span id="an_11:12">11:12</span> For whether absent or present, they
were tormented alike.

<span id="an_11:13">11:13</span> For a double affliction came upon them,
and a groaning for the remembrance of things past.

<span id="an_11:14">11:14</span> For when they heard that by their
punishments the others were benefited, they remembered the Lord,
wondering at the end of what was come to pass.

<span id="an_11:15">11:15</span> For whom they scorned before, when he
was thrown out at the time of his being wickedly exposed to perish, him
they admired in the end, when they saw the event: their thirsting being
unlike to that of the just.

<span id="an_11:16">11:16</span> But for the foolish devices of their
iniquity, because some being deceived worshipped dumb serpents and
worthless beasts, thou didst send upon them a multitude of dumb beasts
for vengeance.

<span id="an_11:17">11:17</span> That they might know that by what
things a man sinneth, by the same also he is tormented.

<span id="an_11:18">11:18</span> For thy almighty hand, which made the
world of matter without form, was not unable to send upon them a
multitude of bears, or fierce lions,

<span id="an_11:19">11:19</span> Or unknown beasts of a new kind, full
of rage: either breathing out a fiery vapour, or sending forth a
stinking smoke, or shooting horrible sparks out of their eyes:

<span id="an_11:20">11:20</span> Whereof not only the hurt might be able
to destroy them, but also the very sight might kill them through fear.

<span id="an_11:21">11:21</span> Yea and without these, they might have
been slain with one blast, persecuted by their own deeds, and scattered
by the breath of thy power: but thou hast ordered all things in measure,
and number, and weight.

<span id="an_11:22">11:22</span> For great power always belonged to thee
alone: and who shall resist the strength of thy arm?

<span id="an_11:23">11:23</span> For the whole world before thee is as
the least grain of the balance, and as a drop of the morning dew, that
falleth down upon the earth:

<span id="an_11:24">11:24</span> But thou hast mercy upon all, because
thou canst do all things, and overlookest the sins of men for the sake
of repentance.

<span id="an_11:25">11:25</span> For thou lovest all things that are,
and hatest none of the things which thou hast made: for thou didst not
appoint, or make any thing hating it.

<span id="an_11:26">11:26</span> And how could any thing endure, if thou
wouldst not? or be preserved, if not called by thee.

<span id="an_11:27">11:27</span> But thou sparest all: because they are
thine, O Lord, who lovest souls.

<span id="an_12:1">12:1</span> O how good and sweet is thy spirit, O
Lord, in all things!

<span id="an_12:2">12:2</span> And therefore thou chastisest them that
err, by little and little: and admonishest them, and speakest to them,
concerning the things wherein they offend: that leaving their
wickedness, they may believe in thee, O Lord.

<span id="an_12:3">12:3</span> For those ancient inhabitants of thy holy
land, whom thou didst abhor,

<span id="an_12:4">12:4</span> Because they did works hateful to thee by
their sorceries, and wicked sacrifices,

<span id="an_12:5">12:5</span> And those merciless murderers of their
own children, and eaters of men's bowels, and devourers of blood from
the midst of thy consecration,

<span id="an_12:6">12:6</span> And those parents sacrificing with their
own hands helpless souls, it was thy will to destroy by the hands of our
parents,

<span id="an_12:7">12:7</span> That the land which of all is most dear
to thee might receive a worthy colony of the children of God.

<span id="an_12:8">12:8</span> Yet even those thou sparedst as men, and
didst send wasps, forerunners of thy host, to destroy them by little and
little.

<span id="an_12:9">12:9</span> Not that thou wast unable to bring the
wicked under the just by war, or by cruel beasts, or with one rough word
to destroy them at once:

<span id="an_12:10">12:10</span> But executing thy judgments by degrees
thou gavest them place of repentance, not being ignorant that they were
a wicked generation, and their malice natural, and that their thought
could never be changed.

<span id="an_12:11">12:11</span> For it was a cursed seed from the
beginning: neither didst thou for fear of any one give pardon to their
sins.

<span id="an_12:12">12:12</span> For who shall say to thee: What hast
thou done? or who shall withstand thy judgment? or who shall come before
thee to be a revenger of wicked men? or who shall accuse thee, if the
nations perish, which thou hast made?

<span id="an_12:13">12:13</span> For there is no other God but thou, who
hast care of all, that thou shouldst shew that thou dost not give
judgment unjustly.

<span id="an_12:14">12:14</span> Neither shall king, nor tyrant in thy
sight inquire about them whom thou hast destroyed.

<span id="an_12:15">12:15</span> For so much then as thou art just, thou
orderest all things justly: thinking it not agreeable to thy power, to
condemn him who deserveth not to be punished.

<span id="an_12:16">12:16</span> For thy power is the beginning of
justice: and because thou art Lord of all, thou makest thyself gracious
to all.

<span id="an_12:17">12:17</span> For thou shewest thy power, when men
will not believe thee to be absolute in power, and thou convincest the
boldness of them that know thee not.

<span id="an_12:18">12:18</span> But thou being master of power, judgest
with tranquillity; and with great favour disposest of us: for thy power
is at hand when thou wilt.

<span id="an_12:19">12:19</span> But thou hast taught thy people by such
works, that they must be just and humane, and hast made thy children to
be of a good hope: because in judging thou givest place for repentance
for sins.

<span id="an_12:20">12:20</span> For if thou didst punish the enemies of
thy servants, and that deserved to die, with so great deliberation,
giving them time and place whereby they might be changed from their
wickedness:

<span id="an_12:21">12:21</span> With what circumspection hast thou
judged thy own children, to whose parents thou hast sworn and made
covenants of good promises?

<span id="an_12:22">12:22</span> Therefore whereas thou chastisest us,
thou scourgest our enemies very many ways, to the end that when we judge
we may think on thy goodness: and when we are judged, we may hope for
thy mercy.

<span id="an_12:23">12:23</span> Wherefore thou hast also greatly
tormented them who in their life have lived foolishly and unjustly, by
the same things which they worshipped.

<span id="an_12:24">12:24</span> For they went astray for a long time in
the ways of error, holding those things for gods which are the most
worthless among beasts, living after the manner of children without
understanding.

<span id="an_12:25">12:25</span> Therefore thou hast sent a judgment
upon them as senseless children to mock them.

<span id="an_12:26">12:26</span> But they that were not amended by
mockeries and reprehensions, experienced the worthy judgment of God.

<span id="an_12:27">12:27</span> For seeing with indignation that they
suffered by those very things which they took for gods, when they were
destroyed by the same, they acknowledged him the true God, whom in time
past they denied that they knew: for which cause the end also of their
condemnation came upon them.

<span id="an_13:1">13:1</span> But all men are vain, in whom there is
not the knowledge of God: and who by these good things that are seen,
could not understand him that is, neither by attending to the works have
acknowledged who was the workman:

<span id="an_13:2">13:2</span> But have imagined either the fire, or the
wind, or the swift air, or the circle of the stars, or the great water,
or the sun and moon, to be the gods that rule the world.

<span id="an_13:3">13:3</span> With whose beauty, if they, being
delighted, took them to be gods: let them know how much the Lord of them
is more beautiful than they: for the first author of beauty made all
those things.

<span id="an_13:4">13:4</span> Or if they admired their power and their
effects, let them understand by them, that he that made them, is
mightier than they:

<span id="an_13:5">13:5</span> For by the greatness of the beauty, and
of the creature, the creator of them may be seen, so as to be known
thereby.

<span id="an_13:6">13:6</span> But yet as to these they are less to be
blamed. For they perhaps err, seeking God, and desirous to find him.

<span id="an_13:7">13:7</span> For being conversant among his works,
they search: and they are persuaded that the things are good which are
seen.

<span id="an_13:8">13:8</span> But then again they are not to be
pardoned.

<span id="an_13:9">13:9</span> For if they were able to know so much as
to make a judgment of the world: how did they not more easily find out
the Lord thereof?

<span id="an_13:10">13:10</span> But unhappy are they, and their hope is
among the dead, who have called gods the works of the hands of men, gold
and silver, the inventions of art, and the resemblances of beasts, or an
unprofitable stone the work of an ancient hand.

<span id="an_13:11">13:11</span> Or if an artist, a carpenter, hath cut
down a tree proper for his use in the wood, and skilfully taken off all
the bark thereof, and with his art, diligently formeth a vessel
profitable for the common uses of life,

<span id="an_13:12">13:12</span> And useth the chips of his work to
dress his meat:

<span id="an_13:13">13:13</span> And taking what was left thereof, which
is good for nothing, being a crooked piece of wood, and full of knots,
carveth it diligently when he hath nothing else to do, and by the skill
of his art fashioneth it and maketh it like the image of a man:

<span id="an_13:14">13:14</span> Or the resemblance of some beast,
laying it over with vermillion, and painting it red, and covering every
spot that is in it:

<span id="an_13:15">13:15</span> And maketh a convenient dwelling place
for it, and setting it in a wall, and fastening it with iron,

<span id="an_13:16">13:16</span> Providing for it, lest it should fall,
knowing that it is unable to help itself: for it is an image, and hath
need of help.

<span id="an_13:17">13:17</span> And then maketh prayer to it, inquiring
concerning his substance, and his children, or his marriage. And he is
not ashamed to speak to that which hath no life:

<span id="an_13:18">13:18</span> And for health he maketh suspplication
to the weak, and for life prayeth to that which is dead, and for help
calleth upon that which is unprofitable:

<span id="an_13:19">13:19</span> And for a good journey he petitioneth
him that cannot walk: and for getting, and for working, and for the
event of all things he asketh him that is unable to do any thing.

<span id="an_14:1">14:1</span> Again, another designing to sail, and
beginning to make his voyage through the raging waves, calleth upon a
piece of wood more frail than the wood that carrieth him.

<span id="an_14:2">14:2</span> For this the desire of gain devised, and
the workman built it by his skill.

<span id="an_14:3">14:3</span> But thy providence, O Father, governeth
it: for thou hast made a way even in the sea, and a most sure path among
the waves,

<span id="an_14:4">14:4</span> Shewing that thou art able to save out of
all things, yea though a man went to sea without art.

<span id="an_14:5">14:5</span> But that the works of thy wisdom might
not be idle: therefore men also trust their lives even to a little wood,
and passing over the sea by ship are saved.

<span id="an_14:6">14:6</span> And from the beginning also when the
proud giants perished, the hope of the world fleeing to a vessel, which
was governed by thy hand, left to the world seed of generation.

<span id="an_14:7">14:7</span> For blessed is the wood, by which justice
cometh.

<span id="an_14:8">14:8</span> But the idol that is made by hands, is
cursed, as well it, as he that made it: he because he made it; and it
because being frail it is called a god.

<span id="an_14:9">14:9</span> But to God the wicked and his wickedness
are hateful alike.

<span id="an_14:10">14:10</span> For that which is made, together with
him that made it, shall suffer torments.

<span id="an_14:11">14:11</span> Therefore there shall be no respect had
even to the idols of the Gentiles: because the creatures of God are
turned to an abomination, and a temptation to the souls of men, and a
snare to the feet of the unwise.

<span id="an_14:12">14:12</span> For the beginning of fornication is the
devising of idols: and the invention of them is the corruption of life.

<span id="an_14:13">14:13</span> For neither were they from the
beginning, neither shall they be for ever.

<span id="an_14:14">14:14</span> For by the vanity of men they came into
the world: and therefore they shall be found to come shortly to an end.

<span id="an_14:15">14:15</span> For a father being afflicted with
bitter grief, made to himself the image of his son who was quickly taken
away: and him who then had died as a man, he began now to worship as a
god, and appointed him rites and sacrifices among his servants.

<span id="an_14:16">14:16</span> Then in process of time, wicked custom
prevailing, this error was kept as a law, and statues were worshipped by
the commandment of tyrants.

<span id="an_14:17">14:17</span> And those whom men could not honour in
presence, because they dwelt far off, they brought their resemblance
from afar, and made an express image of the king whom they had a mind to
honour: that by this their diligence, they might honour as present, him
that was absent.

<span id="an_14:18">14:18</span> And to worshipping of these, the
singular diligence also of the artificer helped to set forward the
ignorant.

<span id="an_14:19">14:19</span> For he being willing to please him that
employed him, laboured with all his art to make the resemblance in the
best manner.

<span id="an_14:20">14:20</span> And the multitude of men, carried away
by the beauty of the work, took him now for a god that a little before
was but honoured as a man.

<span id="an_14:21">14:21</span> And this was the occasion of deceiving
human life: for men serving either their affection, or their kings, gave
the incommunicable name to stones and wood.

<span id="an_14:22">14:22</span> And it was not enough for them to err
about the knowledge of God, but whereas they lived in a great war of
ignorance, they call so many and so great evils peace.

<span id="an_14:23">14:23</span> For either they sacrifice their own
children, or use hidden sacrifices, or keep watches full of madness,

<span id="an_14:24">14:24</span> So that now they neither keep life, nor
marriage undefiled, but one killeth another through envy, or grieveth
him by adultery:

<span id="an_14:25">14:25</span> And all things are mingled together,
blood, murder, theft and dissimulation, corruption and unfaithfulness,
tumults and perjury, disquieting of the good,

<span id="an_14:26">14:26</span> Forgetfulness of God, defiling of
souls, changing of nature, disorder in marriage, and the irregularity of
adultery and uncleaness.

<span id="an_14:27">14:27</span> For the worship of abominable idols is
the cause, and the beginning and end of all evil.

<span id="an_14:28">14:28</span> For either they are mad when they are
merry: or they prophesy lies, or they live unjustly, or easily forswear
themselves.

<span id="an_14:29">14:29</span> For whilst they trust in idols, which
are without life, though they swear amiss, they look not to be hurt.

<span id="an_14:30">14:30</span> But for two things they shall be justly
punished, because they have thought not well of God, giving heed to
idols, and have sworn unjustly, in guile despising justice.

<span id="an_14:31">14:31</span> For it is not the power of them, by
whom they swear, but the just vengeance of sinners always punisheth the
transgression of the unjust.

<span id="an_15:1">15:1</span> But thou, our God, art gracious and true,
patient, and ordering all things in mercy.

<span id="an_15:2">15:2</span> For if we sin, we are thine, knowing thy
greatness: and if we sin not, we know that we are counted with thee.

<span id="an_15:3">15:3</span> For to know thee is perfect justice: and
to know thy justice, and thy power, is the root of immortality.

<span id="an_15:4">15:4</span> For the invention of mischievous men hath
not deceived us, nor the shadow of a picture, a fruitless labour, a
graven figure with divers colours,

<span id="an_15:5">15:5</span> The sight whereof enticeth the fool to
lust after it, and he loveth the lifeless figure of a dead image.

<span id="an_15:6">15:6</span> The lovers of evil things deserve to have
no better things to trust in, both they that make them, and they that
love them,and they that worship them.

<span id="an_15:7">15:7</span> The potter also tempering soft earth,
with labour fashioneth every vessel for our service, and of the same
clay he maketh both vessels that are for clean uses, and likewise such
as serve to the contrary: but what is the use of these vessels, the
potter is the judge.

<span id="an_15:8">15:8</span> And of the same clay by a vain labour he
maketh a god: he who a little before was made of earth himself, and a
little after returneth to the same out of which he was taken, when his
life which was lent him shall be called for again.

<span id="an_15:9">15:9</span> But his care is, not that he shall
labour, nor that his life is short, but he striveth with the goldsmiths
and silversmiths: and he endeavoureth to do like the workers in brass,
and counteth it a glory to make vain things.

<span id="an_15:10">15:10</span> For his heart is ashes, and his hope
vain earth, and his life more base than clay:

<span id="an_15:11">15:11</span> Forasmuch as he knew not his maker and
him that inspired into him the soul that worketh, and that breathed into
him a living spirit.

<span id="an_15:12">15:12</span> Yea and they have counted our life a
pastime, and the business of life to be gain, and that we must be
getting every way, even out of evil.

<span id="an_15:13">15:13</span> For that man knoweth that he offendeth
above all others, who of earthly matter maketh brittle vessels, and
graven gods.

<span id="an_15:14">15:14</span> But all the enemies of thy people that
hold them in subjection, are foolish, and unhappy, and proud beyond
measure:

<span id="an_15:15">15:15</span> For they have esteemed all the idols of
the heathens for gods, which neither have the use of eyes to see, nor
noses to draw breath, nor ears to hear, nor fingers of hands to handle,
and as for their feet, they are slow to walk.

<span id="an_15:16">15:16</span> For man made them: and he that
borroweth his own breath, fashioned them. For no man can make a god like
to himself.

<span id="an_15:17">15:17</span> For being mortal himself, he formeth a
dead thing with his wicked hands. For he is better than they whom he
worshippeth, because he indeed hath lived, though he were mortal, but
they never.

<span id="an_15:18">15:18</span> Moreover they worship also the vilest
creatures: but things without sense compared to these, are worse than
they.

<span id="an_15:19">15:19</span> Yea, neither by sight can any man see
good of these beasts. But they have fled from the praise of God, and
from his blessing.

<span id="an_16:1">16:1</span> For these things, and by the like things
to these, they were worthily punished, and were destroyed by a multitude
of beasts.

<span id="an_16:2">16:2</span> Instead of which punishment, dealing well
with thy people, thou gavest them their desire of delicious food, of a
new taste, preparing for them quails for their meat:

<span id="an_16:3">16:3</span> To the end that they indeed desiring
food, by means of those things that were shewn and sent among them,
might loathe even that which was necessary to satisfy their desire. But
these, after suffering want for a short time, tasted a new meat.

<span id="an_16:4">16:4</span> For it was requisite that inevitable
destruction should come upon them that exercised tyranny: but to these
it should only be shewn how their enemies were destroyed.

<span id="an_16:5">16:5</span> For when the fierce rage of beasts came
upon these, they were destroyed with the bitings of crooked serpents.

<span id="an_16:6">16:6</span> But thy wrath endured not for ever, but
they were troubled for a short time for their correction, having a sign
of salvation to put them in remembrance of the commandment of thy law.

<span id="an_16:7">16:7</span> For he that turned to it, was not healed
by that which he saw, but by thee the Saviour of all.

<span id="an_16:8">16:8</span> And in this thou didst shew to our
enemies, that thou art he who deliverest from all evil.

<span id="an_16:9">16:9</span> For the bitings of locusts, and of flies
killed them, and there was found no remedy for their life: because they
were worthy to be destroyed by such things.

<span id="an_16:10">16:10</span> But not even the teeth of venomous
serpents overcame thy children: for thy mercy came and healed them.

<span id="an_16:11">16:11</span> For they were examined for the
remembrance of thy words, and were quickly healed, lest falling into
deep forgetfulness, they might not be able to use thy help.

<span id="an_16:12">16:12</span> For it was neither herb, nor mollifying
plaster that healed them, but thy word, O Lord, which healeth all
things.

<span id="an_16:13">16:13</span> For it is thou, O Lord, that hast power
of life and death, and leadest down to the gates of death, and bringest
back again:

<span id="an_16:14">16:14</span> A man indeed killeth through malice,
and when the spirit is gone forth, it shall not return, neither shall he
call back the soul that is received:

<span id="an_16:15">16:15</span> But it is impossible to escape thy
hand.

<span id="an_16:16">16:16</span> For the wicked that denied to know
thee, were scourged by the strength of thy arm, being persecuted by
strange waters, and hail, and rain, and consumed by fire.

<span id="an_16:17">16:17</span> And which was wonderful, in water,
which extinguisheth all things, the fire had more force: for the world
fighteth for the just.

<span id="an_16:18">16:18</span> For at one time, the fire was
mitigated, that the beasts which were sent against the wicked might not
be burned, but that they might see and perceive that they were
persecuted by the judgment of God.

<span id="an_16:19">16:19</span> And at another time the fire, above its
own power, burned in the midst of water, to destroy the fruits of a
wicked land.

<span id="an_16:20">16:20</span> Instead of which things thou didst feed
thy people with the food of angels, and gavest them bread from heaven
prepared without labour; having in it all that is delicious, and the
sweetness of every taste.

<span id="an_16:21">16:21</span> For thy sustenance shewed thy sweetness
to thy children, and serving every man's will, it was turned to what
every man liked.

<span id="an_16:22">16:22</span> But snow and ice endured the force of
fire, and melted not: that they might know that fire burning in the hail
and flashing in the rain destroyed the fruits of the enemies.

<span id="an_16:23">16:23</span> But this same again, that the just
might be nourished, did even forget its own strength.

<span id="an_16:24">16:24</span> For the creature serving thee the
Creator, is made fierce against the unjust for their punishment; and
abateth its strength for the benefit of them that trust in thee.

<span id="an_16:25">16:25</span> Therefore even then it was transformed
into all things, and was obedient to thy grace that nourisheth all,
according to the will of them that desired it of thee.

<span id="an_16:26">16:26</span> That thy children, O Lord, whom thou
lovedst, might know that it is not the growing of fruits that nourisheth
men, but thy word preseveth them that believe in thee:

<span id="an_16:27">16:27</span> For that which could not be destroyed
by fire, being warmed with a little sunbeam presently melted away:

<span id="an_16:28">16:28</span> That it might be known to all, that we
ought to prevent the sun to bless thee, and adore thee at the dawning of
the light.

<span id="an_16:29">16:29</span> For the hope of the unthankful shall
melt away as the winter's ice, and shall run off as unprofitable water.

<span id="an_17:1">17:1</span> For thy judgments, O Lord, are great, and
thy words cannot be expressed: therefore undisciplined souls have erred.

<span id="an_17:2">17:2</span> For while the wicked thought to be able
to have dominion over the holy nation, they themselves being fettered
with the bonds of darkness, and a long night, shut up in their houses,
lay there exiled from the eternal providence.

<span id="an_17:3">17:3</span> And while they thought to lie hid in
their obscure sins, they were scattered under a dark veil of
forgetfulness, being horribly afraid and troubled with exceeding great
astonishment.

<span id="an_17:4">17:4</span> For neither did the den that held them,
keep them from fear: for noises coming down troubled them, and sad
visions appearing to them, affrighted them.

<span id="an_17:5">17:5</span> And no power of fire could give them
light, neither could the bright flames of the stars enlighten that
horrible night.

<span id="an_17:6">17:6</span> But there appeared to them a sudden fire,
very dreadful: and being struck with the fear of that face, which was
not seen, they thought the things which they saw to be worse:

<span id="an_17:7">17:7</span> And the delusions of their magic art were
put down, and their boasting of wisdom was reproachfully rebuked.

<span id="an_17:8">17:8</span> For they who promised to drive away fears
and troubles from a sick soul, were sick themselves of a fear worthy to
be laughed at.

<span id="an_17:9">17:9</span> For though no terrible thing disturbed
them: yet being scared with the passing by of beasts, and hissing of
serpents, they died for fear: and denying that they saw the air, which
could by no means be avoided.

<span id="an_17:10">17:10</span> For whereas wickedness is fearful, it
beareth witness of its condemnation: for a troubled conscience always
forecasteth grievous things.

<span id="an_17:11">17:11</span> For fear is nothing else but a yielding
up of the succours from thought.

<span id="an_17:12">17:12</span> And while there is less expectation
from within, the greater doth it count the ignorance of that cause which
bringeth the torment.

<span id="an_17:13">17:13</span> But they that during that night, in
which nothing could be done, and which came upon them from the lowest
and deepest hell, slept the same sleep.

<span id="an_17:14">17:14</span> Were sometimes molested with the fear
of monsters, sometimes fainted away, their soul failing them: for a
sudden and unlooked for fear was come upon them.

<span id="an_17:15">17:15</span> Moreover if any of them had fallen
down, he was kept shut up in prison without irons.

<span id="an_17:16">17:16</span> For if any one were a husbandman, or a
shepherd, or a labourer in the field, and was suddenly overtaken, he
endured a necessity from which he could not fly.

<span id="an_17:17">17:17</span> For they were all bound together with
one chain of darkness. Whether it were a whistling wind, or the
melodious voice of birds, among the spreading branches of trees, or a
fall of water running down with violence,

<span id="an_17:18">17:18</span> Or the mighty noise of stones tumbling
down, or the running that could not be seen of beasts playing together,
or the roaring voice of wild beasts, or a rebounding echo from the
highest mountains: these things made them to swoon for fear.

<span id="an_17:19">17:19</span> For the whole world was enlightened
with a clear light, and none were hindered in their labours.

<span id="an_17:20">17:20</span> But over them only was spread a heavy
night, an image of that darkness which was to come upon them. But they
were to themselves more grievous than the darkness.

<span id="an_18:1">18:1</span> But thy saints had a very great light,
and they heard their voice indeed, but did not see their shape. And
because they also did not suffer the same things, they glorified thee:

<span id="an_18:2">18:2</span> And they that before had been wronged,
gave thanks, because they were not hurt now: and asked this gift, that
there might be a difference.

<span id="an_18:3">18:3</span> Therefore they received a burning pillar
of fire for a guide of the way which they knew not, and thou gavest them
a harmless sun of a good entertainment.

<span id="an_18:4">18:4</span> The others indeed were worthy to be
deprived of light, and imprisoned in darkness, who kept thy children
shut up, by whom the pure light of the law was to be given to the world.

<span id="an_18:5">18:5</span> And whereas they thought to kill the
babes of the just, one child being cast forth, and saved, to reprove
them, thou tookest away a multitude of their children, and destroyedst
them all together in a mighty water.

<span id="an_18:6">18:6</span> For that night was known before by our
fathers, that assuredly knowing what oaths they had trusted to, they
might be of better courage.

<span id="an_18:7">18:7</span> So thy people received the salvation of
the just, and destruction of the unjust.

<span id="an_18:8">18:8</span> For as thou didst punish the adversaries:
so thou didst also encourage and glorify us.

<span id="an_18:9">18:9</span> For the just children of good men were
offering sacrifice secretly, and they unanimously ordered a law of
justice: that the just should receive both good and evil alike, singing
now the praises of the fathers.

<span id="an_18:10">18:10</span> But on the other side there sounded an
ill according cry of the enemies, and a lamentable mourning was heard
for the children that were bewailed.

<span id="an_18:11">18:11</span> And the servant suffered the same
punishment as the master, and a common man suffered in like manner as
the king.

<span id="an_18:12">18:12</span> So all alike had innumerable dead, with
one kind of death. Neither were the living sufficient to bury them; for
in one moment the noblest offspring of them was destroyed.

<span id="an_18:13">18:13</span> For whereas they would not believe any
thing before by reason of the enchantments, then first upon the
destruction of the firstborn, they acknowledged the people to be of God.

<span id="an_18:14">18:14</span> For while all things were in quiet
silence, and the night was in the midst of her course,

<span id="an_18:15">18:15</span> Thy almighty word leapt down from
heaven from thy royal throne, as a fierce conqueror into the midst of
the land of destruction.

<span id="an_18:16">18:16</span> With a sharp sword carrying thy
unfeigned commandment, and he stood and filled all things with death,
and standing on the earth reached even to heaven.

<span id="an_18:17">18:17</span> Then suddenly visions of evil dreams
troubled them, and fears unlooked for came upon them.

<span id="an_18:18">18:18</span> And one thrown here, another there,
half dead, shewed the cause of his death.

<span id="an_18:19">18:19</span> For the visions that troubled them
foreshewed these things, lest they should perish and not know why they
suffered these evils.

<span id="an_18:20">18:20</span> But the just also were afterwards
touched by an assault of death, and there was a disturbance of the
multitude in the wilderness: but thy wrath did not long continue.

<span id="an_18:21">18:21</span> For a blameless man made haste to pray
for the people, bringing forth the shield of his ministry, prayer, and
by incense making supplication, withstood the wrath, and put an end to
the calamity, shewing that he was thy servant.

<span id="an_18:22">18:22</span> And he overcame the disturbance, not by
strength of body nor with force of arms, but with a word he subdued him
that punished them, alleging the oaths and covenant made with the
fathers.

<span id="an_18:23">18:23</span> For when they were now fallen down dead
by heaps one upon another, he stood between and stayed the assault, and
cut off the way to the living.

<span id="an_18:24">18:24</span> For in the priestly robe which he wore,
was the whole world: and in the four rows of the stones the glory of the
fathers was graven, and thy majesty was written upon the diadem of his
head.

<span id="an_18:25">18:25</span> And to these the destroyer gave place,
and was afraid of them: for the proof only of wrath was enough.

<span id="an_19:1">19:1</span> But as to the wicked, even to the end
there came upon them wrath without mercy. For he knew before also what
they would do:

<span id="an_19:2">19:2</span> For when they had given them leave to
depart, and had sent them away with great care, they repented, and
pursued after them.

<span id="an_19:3">19:3</span> For whilst they were yet mourning, and
lamenting at the graves of the dead, they took up another foolish
device: and pursued them as fugitives whom they had pressed to be gone:

<span id="an_19:4">19:4</span> For a necessity, of which they were
worthy, brought them to this end: and they lost the remembrance of those
things which had happened, that their punishment might fill up what was
wanting to their torments:

<span id="an_19:5">19:5</span> And that thy people might wonderfully
pass through, but they might find a new death.

<span id="an_19:6">19:6</span> For every creature according to its kind
was fashioned again as from the beginning, obeying thy commandments,
that thy children might be kept without hurt.

<span id="an_19:7">19:7</span> For a cloud overshadowed their camp, and
where water was before, dry land appeared, and in the Red Sea a way
without hinderance, and out of the great deep a springing field:

<span id="an_19:8">19:8</span> Through which all the nation passed which
was protected with thy hand, seeing thy miracles and wonders.

<span id="an_19:9">19:9</span> For they fed on their food like horses,
and they skipped like lambs, praising thee, O Lord, who hadst delivered
them.

<span id="an_19:10">19:10</span> For they were yet mindful of those
things which had been done in the time of their sojourning, how the
ground brought forth flies instead of cattle, and how the river cast up
a multitude of frogs instead of fishes.

<span id="an_19:11">19:11</span> And at length they saw a new generation
of birds, when being led by their appetite they asked for delicate
meats.

<span id="an_19:12">19:12</span> For to satisfy their desire, the quail
came up to them from the sea: and punishments came upon the sinners, not
without foregoing signs by the force of thunders: for they suffered
justly according to their own wickedness.

<span id="an_19:13">19:13</span> For they exercised a more detestable
inhospitality than any: others indeed received not strangers unknown to
them, but these brought their guests into bondage that had deserved well
of them.

<span id="an_19:14">19:14</span> And not only so, but in another respect
also they were worse: for the others against their will received the
strangers.

<span id="an_19:15">19:15</span> But these grievously afflicted them
whom they had received with joy, and who lived under the same laws.

<span id="an_19:16">19:16</span> But they were struck with blindness: as
those others were at the doors of the just man, when they were covered
with sudden darkness, and every one sought the passage of his own door.

<span id="an_19:17">19:17</span> For while the elements are changed in
themselves, as in an instrument the sound of the quality is changed, yet
all keep their sound: which may clearly be perceived by the very sight.

<span id="an_19:18">19:18</span> For the things of the land were turned
into things of the water: and the things before swam in the water passed
upon the land.

<span id="an_19:19">19:19</span> The fire had power in water above its
own virtue, and the water forgot its quenching nature.

<span id="an_19:20">19:20</span> On the other side, the flames wasted
not the flesh of corruptible animals walking therein, neither did they
melt that good food, which was apt to melt as ice. For in all things
thou didst magnify thy people, O Lord, and didst honour them, and didst
not despise them, but didst assist them at all times, and in every
place.
