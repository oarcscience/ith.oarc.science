### Douay-Rheims Bible: 1 Corinthians

<span id="an_1:1">1:1</span> PAUL, called to be an apostle of Jesus
Christ by the will of God, and Sosthenes a brother,

<span id="an_1:2">1:2</span> To the church of God that is at Corinth, to
them that are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called to be saints, with all
that invoke the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, in every place of theirs
and ours.

<span id="an_1:3">1:3</span> Grace to you, and peace from God our
Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.

<span id="an_1:4">1:4</span> I give thanks to my God always for you, for
the grace of God that is given you in Christ Jesus,

<span id="an_1:5">1:5</span> That in all things you are made rich in
him, in all utterance, and in all knowledge;

<span id="an_1:6">1:6</span> As the testimony of Christ was confirmed in
you,

<span id="an_1:7">1:7</span> So that nothing is wanting to you in any
grace, waiting for the manifestation of our Lord Jesus Christ.

<span id="an_1:8">1:8</span> Who also will confirm you unto the end
without crime, in the day of the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.

<span id="an_1:9">1:9</span> God is faithful: by whom you are called
unto the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord.

<span id="an_1:10">1:10</span> Now I beseech you, brethren, by the name
of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you all speak the same thing, and that
there be no schisms among you; but that you be perfect in the same mind,
and in the same judgment.

<span id="an_1:11">1:11</span> For it hath been signified unto me, my
brethren, of you, by them that are of the house of Chloe, that there are
contentions among you.

<span id="an_1:12">1:12</span> Now this I say, that every one of you
saith: I indeed am of Paul; and I am of Apollo; and I am of Cephas; and
I of Christ.

<span id="an_1:13">1:13</span> Is Christ divided? Was Paul then
crucified for you? or were you baptized in the name of Paul?

<span id="an_1:14">1:14</span> I give God thanks, that I baptized none
of you but Crispus and Caius;

<span id="an_1:15">1:15</span> Lest any should say that you were
baptized in my name.

<span id="an_1:16">1:16</span> And I baptized also the household of
Stephanus; besides, I know not whether I baptized any other.

<span id="an_1:17">1:17</span> For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to
preach the gospel: not in wisdom of speech, lest the cross of Christ
should be made void.

<span id="an_1:18">1:18</span> For the word of the cross, to them indeed
that perish, is foolishness; but to them that are saved, that is, to us,
it is the power of God.

<span id="an_1:19">1:19</span> For it is written: I will destroy the
wisdom of the wise, and the prudence of the prudent I will reject.

<span id="an_1:20">1:20</span> Where is the wise? Where is the scribe?
Where is the disputer of this world? Hath not God made foolish the
wisdom of this world?

<span id="an_1:21">1:21</span> For seeing that in the wisdom of God the
world, by wisdom, knew not God, it pleased God, by the foolishness of
our preaching, to save them that believe.

<span id="an_1:22">1:22</span> For both the Jews require signs, and the
Greeks seek after wisdom:

<span id="an_1:23">1:23</span> But we preach Christ crucified, unto the
Jews indeed a stumblingblock, and unto the Gentiles foolishness:

<span id="an_1:24">1:24</span> But unto them that are called, both Jews
and Greeks, Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God.

<span id="an_1:25">1:25</span> For the foolishness of God is wiser than
men; and the weakness of God is stronger than men.

<span id="an_1:26">1:26</span> For see your vocation, brethren, that
there are not many wise according to the flesh, not many mighty, not
many noble:

<span id="an_1:27">1:27</span> But the foolish things of the world hath
God chosen, that he may confound the wise; and the weak things of the
world hath God chosen, that he may confound the strong.

<span id="an_1:28">1:28</span> And the base things of the world, and the
things that are contemptible, hath God chosen, and things that are not,
that he might bring to nought things that are:

<span id="an_1:29">1:29</span> That no flesh should glory in his sight.

<span id="an_1:30">1:30</span> But of him are you in Christ Jesus, who
of God is made unto us wisdom, and justice, and sanctification, and
redemption:

<span id="an_1:31">1:31</span> That, as it is written: He that glorieth,
may glory in the Lord.

<span id="an_2:1">2:1</span> AND I, brethren, when I came to you, came
not in loftiness of speech or of wisdom, declaring unto you the
testimony of Christ.

<span id="an_2:2">2:2</span> For I judged not myself to know anything
among you, but Jesus Christ, and him crucified.

<span id="an_2:3">2:3</span> And I was with you in weakness, and in
fear, and in much trembling.

<span id="an_2:4">2:4</span> And my speech and my preaching was not in
the persuasive words of human wisdom, but in shewing of the Spirit and
power;

<span id="an_2:5">2:5</span> That your faith might not stand on the
wisdom of men, but on the power of God.

<span id="an_2:6">2:6</span> Howbeit we speak wisdom among the perfect:
yet not the wisdom of this world, neither of the princes of this world
that come to nought;

<span id="an_2:7">2:7</span> But we speak the wisdom of God in a
mystery, a wisdom which is hidden, which God ordained before the world,
unto our glory :

<span id="an_2:8">2:8</span> Which none of the princes of this world
knew; for if they had known it, they would never have crucified the Lord
of glory.

<span id="an_2:9">2:9</span> But, as it is written: That eye hath not
seen, nor ear heard, neither hath it entered into the heart of man, what
things God hath prepared for them that love him.

<span id="an_2:10">2:10</span> But to us God hath revealed them, by this
Spirit. For the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of
God.

<span id="an_2:11">2:11</span> For what man knoweth the things of a man,
but the spirit of a man that is in him? So the things also that are of
God no man knoweth, but the Spirit of God.

<span id="an_2:12">2:12</span> Now we have received not the spirit of
this world, but the Spirit that is of God; that we may know the things
that are given us from God.

<span id="an_2:13">2:13</span> Which things also we speak, not in the
learned words of human wisdom; but in the doctrine of the Spirit,
comparing spiritual things with spiritual.

<span id="an_2:14">2:14</span> But the sensual man perceiveth not these
things that are of the Spirit of God; for it is foolishness to him, and
he cannot understand, because it is spiritually examined.

<span id="an_2:15">2:15</span> But the spiritual man judgeth all things;
and he himself is judged of no man.

<span id="an_2:16">2:16</span> For who hath known the mind of the Lord,
that we may instruct him? But we have the mind of Christ.

<span id="an_3:1">3:1</span> AND I, brethren, could not speak to you as
unto spiritual, but as unto carnal. As unto little ones in Christ.

<span id="an_3:2">3:2</span> I gave you milk to drink, not meat; for you
were not able as yet. But neither indeed are you now able; for you are
yet carnal.

<span id="an_3:3">3:3</span> For, whereas there is among you envying and
contention, are you not carnal, and walk according to man ?

<span id="an_3:4">3:4</span> For while one saith, I indeed am of Paul;
and another, I am of Apollo; are you not men ? What then is Apollo, and
what is Paul?

<span id="an_3:5">3:5</span> The ministers of him whom you have
believed; and to every one as the Lord hath given.

<span id="an_3:6">3:6</span> I have planted, Apollo watered, but God
gave the increase.

<span id="an_3:7">3:7</span> Therefore, neither he that planteth is any
thing, nor he that watereth; but God that giveth the increase.

<span id="an_3:8">3:8</span> Now he that planteth, and he that watereth,
are one. And every man shall receive his own reward, according to his
own labour.

<span id="an_3:9">3:9</span> For we are God's coadjutors: you are God's
husbandry; you are God's building.

<span id="an_3:10">3:10</span> According to the grace of God that is
given to me, as a wise architect, I have laid the foundation; and
another buildeth thereon. But let every man take heed how he buildeth
thereupon.

<span id="an_3:11">3:11</span> For other foundation no man can lay, but
that which is laid; which is Christ Jesus.

<span id="an_3:12">3:12</span> Now if any man build upon this
foundation, gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, stubble:

<span id="an_3:13">3:13</span> Every man's work shall be manifest; for
the day of the Lord shall declare it, because it shall be revealed in
fire; and the fire shall try every man's work, of what sort it is.

<span id="an_3:14">3:14</span> If any man's work abide, which he hath
built thereupon, he shall receive a reward.

<span id="an_3:15">3:15</span> If any man's work burn, he shall suffer
loss; but he himself shall be saved, yet so as by fire.

<span id="an_3:16">3:16</span> Know you not, that you are the temple of
God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you ?

<span id="an_3:17">3:17</span> But if any man violate the temple of God,
him shall God destroy. For the temple of God is holy, which you are.

<span id="an_3:18">3:18</span> Let no man deceive himself: if any man
among you seem to be wise in this world, let him become a fool, that he
may be wise.

<span id="an_3:19">3:19</span> For the wisdom of this world is
foolishness with God. For it is written: I will catch the wise in their
own craftiness.

<span id="an_3:20">3:20</span> And again: The Lord knoweth the thoughts
of the wise, that they are vain.

<span id="an_3:21">3:21</span> Let no man therefore glory in men.

<span id="an_3:22">3:22</span> For all things are yours, whether it be
Paul, or Apollo, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things
present, or things to some; for all are yours;

<span id="an_3:23">3:23</span> And you are Christ's; and Christ is
God's.

<span id="an_4:1">4:1</span> LET a man so account of us as of the
ministers of Christ, and the dispensers of the mysteries of God.

<span id="an_4:2">4:2</span> Here now it is required among the
dispensers, that a man be found faithful.

<span id="an_4:3">4:3</span> But to me it is a very small thing to be
judged by you, or by man's day; but neither do I judge my own self.

<span id="an_4:4">4:4</span> For I am not conscious to myself of any
thing, yet am I not hereby justified; but he that judgeth me, is the
Lord.

<span id="an_4:5">4:5</span> Therefore judge not before the time; until
the Lord come, who both will bring to light the hidden things of
darkness, and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts; and then
shall every man have praise from God.

<span id="an_4:6">4:6</span> But these things, brethren, I have in a
figure transferred to myself and to Apollo, for your sakes; that in us
you may learn, that one be not puffed up against the other for another,
above that which is written.

<span id="an_4:7">4:7</span> For who distinguisheth thee ? Or what hast
thou that thou hast not received ? And if thou hast received, why dost
thou glory, as if thou hadst not received it ?

<span id="an_4:8">4:8</span> You are now full; you are now become rich;
you reign without us; and I would to God you did reign, that we also
might reign with you.

<span id="an_4:9">4:9</span> For I think that God hath set forth us
apostles, the last, as it were men appointed to death: we are made a
spectacle to the world, and to angels, and to men.

<span id="an_4:10">4:10</span> We are fools for Christ's sake, but you
are wise in Christ; we are weak, but you are strong; you are honourable,
but we without honour.

<span id="an_4:11">4:11</span> Even unto this hour we both hunger and
thirst, and are naked, and are buffeted, and have no fixed abode;

<span id="an_4:12">4:12</span> And we labour, working with our own
hands: we are reviled, and we bless; we are persecuted, and we suffer
it.

<span id="an_4:13">4:13</span> We are blasphemed, and we entreat; we are
made as the refuse of this world, the offscouring of all even until now.

<span id="an_4:14">4:14</span> I write not these things to confound you;
but I admonish you as my dearest children.

<span id="an_4:15">4:15</span> For if you have ten thousand instructors
in Christ, yet not many fathers. For in Christ Jesus, by the gospel, I
have begotten you.

<span id="an_4:16">4:16</span> Wherefore I beseech you, be ye followers
of me, as I also am of Christ.

<span id="an_4:17">4:17</span> For this cause have I sent to you
Timothy, who is my dearest son and faithful in the Lord; who will put
you in mind of my ways, which are in Christ Jesus; as I teach every
where in every church.

<span id="an_4:18">4:18</span> As if I would not come to you, so some
are puffed up.

<span id="an_4:19">4:19</span> But I will come to you shortly, if the
Lord will: and will know, not the speech of them that are puffed up, but
the power.

<span id="an_4:20">4:20</span> For the kingdom of God is not in speech,
but in power.

<span id="an_4:21">4:21</span> What will you ? shall I come to you with
a rod; or in charity, and in the spirit of meekness ?

<span id="an_5:1">5:1</span> IT is absolutely heard, that there is
fornication among you, and such fornication as the like is not among the
heathens; that one should have his father's wife.

<span id="an_5:2">5:2</span> And you are puffed up; and have not rather
mourned, that he might be taken away from among you, that hath done this
deed.

<span id="an_5:3">5:3</span> I indeed, absent in body, but present in
spirit, have already judged, as though I were present, him that hath so
done,

<span id="an_5:4">5:4</span> In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, you
being gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of our Lord
Jesus;

<span id="an_5:5">5:5</span> To deliver such a one to Satan for the
destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of our
Lord Jesus Christ.

<span id="an_5:6">5:6</span> Your glorying is not good. Know you not
that a little leaven corrupteth the whole lump ?

<span id="an_5:7">5:7</span> Purge out the old leaven, that you may be a
new paste, as you are unleavened. For Christ our pasch is sacrificed.

<span id="an_5:8">5:8</span> Therefore let us feast, not with the old
leaven, nor with the leaven of malice and wickedness; but with the
unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.

<span id="an_5:9">5:9</span> I wrote to you in an epistle, not to keep
company with fornicators.

<span id="an_5:10">5:10</span> I mean not with the fornicators of this
world, or with the covetous, or the extortioners, or the servers of
idols; otherwise you must needs go out of this world.

<span id="an_5:11">5:11</span> But now I have written to you, not to
keep company, if any man that is named a brother, be a fornicator, or
covetous, or a server of idols, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an
extortioner: with such a one, not so much as to eat.

<span id="an_5:12">5:12</span> For what have I to do to judge them that
are without ? Do not you judge them that are within ?

<span id="an_5:13">5:13</span> For them that are without, God will
judge. Put away the evil one from among yourselves.

<span id="an_6:1">6:1</span> DARE any of you, having a matter against
another, go to be judged before the unjust, and not before the saints ?

<span id="an_6:2">6:2</span> Know you not that the saints shall judge
this world ? And if the world shall be judged by you, are you unworthy
to judge the smallest matters ?

<span id="an_6:3">6:3</span> Know you not that we shall judge angels ?
how much more things of this world ?

<span id="an_6:4">6:4</span> If therefore you have judgments of things
pertaining to this world, set them to judge, who are the most despised
in the church.

<span id="an_6:5">6:5</span> I speak to your shame. Is it so that there
is not among you any one wise man, that is able to judge between his
brethren ?

<span id="an_6:6">6:6</span> But brother goeth to law with brother, and
that before unbelievers.

<span id="an_6:7">6:7</span> Already indeed there is plainly a fault
among you, that you have lawsuits one with another. Why do you not
rather take wrong? Why do you not rather suffer yourselves to be
defrauded?

<span id="an_6:8">6:8</span> But you do wrong and defraud, and that to
your brethren.

<span id="an_6:9">6:9</span> Know you not that the unjust shall not
possess the kingdom of God? Do not err: neither fornicators, nor
idolaters, nor adulterers,

<span id="an_6:10">6:10</span> Nor the effeminate, nor liers with
mankind, nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor railers, nor
extortioners, shall possess the kingdom of God.

<span id="an_6:11">6:11</span> And such some of you were; but you are
washed, but you are sanctified, but you are justified in the name of our
Lord Jesus Christ, and the Spirit of our God.

<span id="an_6:12">6:12</span> All things are lawful to me, but all
things are not expedient. All things are lawful to me, but I will not be
brought under the power of any.

<span id="an_6:13">6:13</span> Meat for the belly, and the belly for the
meats; but God shall destroy both it and them: but the body is not for
fornication, but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body.

<span id="an_6:14">6:14</span> Now God hath both raised up the Lord, and
will raise us up also by his power.

<span id="an_6:15">6:15</span> Know you not that your bodies are the
members of Christ ? Shall I then take the members of Christ, and make
them the members of an harlot ? God forbid.

<span id="an_6:16">6:16</span> Or know you not, that he who is joined to
a harlot, is made one body ? For they shall be, saith he, two in one
flesh.

<span id="an_6:17">6:17</span> But he who is joined to the Lord, is one
spirit.

<span id="an_6:18">6:18</span> Fly fornication. Every sin that a man
doth, is without the body; but he that committeth fornication, sinneth
against his own body.

<span id="an_6:19">6:19</span> Or know you not, that your members are
the temple of the Holy Ghost, who is in you, whom you have from God; and
you are not your own ?

<span id="an_6:20">6:20</span> For you are bought with a great price.
Glorify and bear God in your body.

<span id="an_7:1">7:1</span> NOW concerning the thing whereof you wrote
to me: It is good for a man not to touch a woman.

<span id="an_7:2">7:2</span> But for fear of fornication, let every man
have his own wife, and let every woman have her own husband.

<span id="an_7:3">7:3</span> Let the husband render the debt to his
wife, and the wife also in like manner to the husband.

<span id="an_7:4">7:4</span> The wife hath not power of her own body,
but the husband. And in like manner the husband also hath not power of
his own body, but the wife.

<span id="an_7:5">7:5</span> Defraud not one another, except, perhaps,
by consent, for a time, that you may give yourselves to prayer; and
return together again, lest Satan tempt you for your incontinency.

<span id="an_7:6">7:6</span> But I speak this by indulgence, not by
commandment.

<span id="an_7:7">7:7</span> For I would that all men were even as
myself: but every one hath his proper gift from God; one after this
manner, and another after that.

<span id="an_7:8">7:8</span> But I say to the unmarried, and to the
widows: It is good for them if they so continue, even as I.

<span id="an_7:9">7:9</span> But if they do not contain themselves, let
them marry. For it is better to marry than to be burnt.

<span id="an_7:10">7:10</span> But to them that are married, not I but
the Lord commandeth, that the wife depart not from her husband.

<span id="an_7:11">7:11</span> And if she depart, that she remain
unmarried, or be reconciled to her husband. And let not the husband put
away his wife.

<span id="an_7:12">7:12</span> For to the rest I speak, not the Lord. If
any brother hath a wife that believeth not, and she consent to dwell
with him, let him not put her away.

<span id="an_7:13">7:13</span> And if any woman hath a husband that
believeth not, and he consent to dwell with her, let her not put away
her husband.

<span id="an_7:14">7:14</span> For the unbelieving husband is sanctified
by the believing wife; and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the
believing husband: otherwise your children should be unclean; but now
they are holy.

<span id="an_7:15">7:15</span> But if the unbeliever depart, let him
depart. For a brother or sister is not under servitude in such cases.
But God hath called us in peace.

<span id="an_7:16">7:16</span> For how knowest thou, O wife, whether
thou shalt save thy husband ? Or how knowest thou, O man, whether thou
shalt save thy wife ?

<span id="an_7:17">7:17</span> But as the Lord hath distributed to every
one, as God hath called every one, so let him walk: and so in all
churches I teach.

<span id="an_7:18">7:18</span> Is any man called, being circumcised ?
let him not procure uncircumcision. Is any man called in uncircumcision
? let him not be circumcised.

<span id="an_7:19">7:19</span> Circumcision is nothing, and
uncircumcision is nothing: but the observance of the commandments of
God.

<span id="an_7:20">7:20</span> Let every man abide in the same calling
in which he was called.

<span id="an_7:21">7:21</span> Wast thou called, being a bondman ? care
not for it; but if thou mayest be made free, use it rather.

<span id="an_7:22">7:22</span> For he that is called in the Lord, being
a bondman, is the freeman of the Lord. Likewise he that is called, being
free, is the bondman of Christ.

<span id="an_7:23">7:23</span> You are bought with a price; be not made
the bondslaves of men.

<span id="an_7:24">7:24</span> Brethren, let every man, wherein he was
called, therein abide with God.

<span id="an_7:25">7:25</span> Now concerning virgins, I have no
commandment of the Lord; but I give counsel, as having obtained mercy of
the Lord, to be faithful.

<span id="an_7:26">7:26</span> I think therefore that this is good for
the present necessity, that it is good for a man so to be.

<span id="an_7:27">7:27</span> Art thou bound to a wife ? seek not to be
loosed. Art thou loosed from a wife ? seek not a wife.

<span id="an_7:28">7:28</span> But if thou take a wife, thou hast not
sinned. And if a virgin marry, she hath not sinned: nevertheless, such
shall have tribulation of the flesh. But I spare you.

<span id="an_7:29">7:29</span> This therefore I say, brethren; the time
is short; it remaineth, that they also who have wives, be as if they had
none;

<span id="an_7:30">7:30</span> And they that weep, as though they wept
not; and they that rejoice, as if they rejoiced not; and they that buy,
as though they possessed not;

<span id="an_7:31">7:31</span> And they that use this world, as if they
used it not: for the fashion of this world passeth away.

<span id="an_7:32">7:32</span> But I would have you to be without
solicitude. He that is without a wife, is solicitous for the things that
belong to the Lord, how he may please God.

<span id="an_7:33">7:33</span> But he that is with a wife, is solicitous
for the things of the world, how he may please his wife: and he is
divided.

<span id="an_7:34">7:34</span> And the unmarried woman and the virgin
thinketh on the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body
and in spirit. But she that is married thinketh on the things of the
world, how she may please her husband.

<span id="an_7:35">7:35</span> And this I speak for your profit: not to
cast a snare upon you; but for that which is decent, and which may give
you power to attend upon the Lord, without impediment.

<span id="an_7:36">7:36</span> But if any man think that he seemeth
dishonoured, with regard to his virgin, for that she is above the age,
and it must so be: let him do what he will; he sinneth not, if she
marry.

<span id="an_7:37">7:37</span> For he that hath determined being
steadfast in his heart, having no necessity, but having power of his own
will; and hath judged this in his heart, to keep his virgin, doth well.

<span id="an_7:38">7:38</span> Therefore, both he that giveth his virgin
in marriage, doth well; and he that giveth her not, doth better.

<span id="an_7:39">7:39</span> A woman is bound by the law as long as
her husband liveth; but if her husband die, she is at liberty: let her
marry to whom she will; only in the Lord.

<span id="an_7:40">7:40</span> But more blessed shall she be, if she so
remain, according to my counsel; and I think that I also have the spirit
of God.

<span id="an_8:1">8:1</span> NOW concerning those things that are
sacrificed to idols, we know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge
puffeth up; but charity edifieth.

<span id="an_8:2">8:2</span> And if any man think that he knoweth any
thing, he hath not yet known as he ought to know.

<span id="an_8:3">8:3</span> But if any any love God, the same is known
by him.

<span id="an_8:4">8:4</span> But as for the meats that are sacrificed to
idols, we know that an idol is nothing in the world, and that there is
no God but one.

<span id="an_8:5">8:5</span> For although there be that are called gods,
either in heaven or on earth (for there be gods many, and lords many);

<span id="an_8:6">8:6</span> Yet to us there is but one God, the Father,
of whom are all things, and we unto him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, by
whom are all things, and we by him.

<span id="an_8:7">8:7</span> But there is not knowledge in every one.
For some until this present, with conscience of the idol: eat as a thing
sacrificed to an idol, and their conscience, being weak, is defiled.

<span id="an_8:8">8:8</span> But meat doth not commend us to God. For
neither, if we eat, shall we have the more; nor, if we eat not, shall we
have the less.

<span id="an_8:9">8:9</span> But take heed lest perhaps this your
liberty become a stumblingblock to the weak.

<span id="an_8:10">8:10</span> For if a man see him that hath knowledge
sit at meat in the idol's temple, shall not his conscience, being weak,
be emboldened to eat those things which are sacrificed to idols ?

<span id="an_8:11">8:11</span> And through thy knowledge shall the weak
brother perish, for whom Christ hath died ?

<span id="an_8:12">8:12</span> Now when you sin thus against the
brethren, and wound their weak conscience, you sin against Christ.

<span id="an_8:13">8:13</span> Wherefore, if meat scandalize my brother,
I will never eat flesh, lest I should scandalize my brother.

<span id="an_9:1">9:1</span> AM not I free? Am not I an apostle? Have
not I seen Christ Jesus our Lord? Are not you my work in the Lord?

<span id="an_9:2">9:2</span> And if unto others I be not an apostle, but
yet to you I am. For you are the seal of my apostleship in the Lord.

<span id="an_9:3">9:3</span> My defence with them that do examine me is
this.

<span id="an_9:4">9:4</span> Have not we power to eat and to drink?

<span id="an_9:5">9:5</span> Have we not power to carry about a woman, a
sister, as well as the rest of the apostles, and the brethren of the
Lord, and Cephas?

<span id="an_9:6">9:6</span> Or I only and Barnabas, have not we power
to do this?

<span id="an_9:7">9:7</span> Who serveth as a soldier at any time, at
his own charges? Who planteth a vineyard, and eateth not of the fruit
thereof? Who feedeth the flock, and eateth not of the milk of the flock?

<span id="an_9:8">9:8</span> Speak I these things according to man? Or
doth not the law also say these things?

<span id="an_9:9">9:9</span> For it is written in the law of Moses: Thou
shalt not muzzle the mouth of the ox that treadeth out the corn. Doth
God take care for oxen?

<span id="an_9:10">9:10</span> Or doth he say this indeed for our sakes?
For these things are written for our sakes: that he that plougheth,
should plough in hope; and he that thrasheth, in hope to receive fruit.

<span id="an_9:11">9:11</span> If we have sown unto you spiritual
things, is it a great matter if we reap your carnal things?

<span id="an_9:12">9:12</span> If others be partakers of this power over
you, why not we rather? Nevertheless, we have not used this power: but
we bear all things, lest we should give any hindrance to the gospel of
Christ.

<span id="an_9:13">9:13</span> Know you not, that they who work in the
holy place, eat the things that are of the holy place; and they that
serve the altar, partake with the altar?

<span id="an_9:14">9:14</span> So also the Lord ordained that they who
preach the gospel, should live by the gospel.

<span id="an_9:15">9:15</span> But I have used none of these things.
Neither have I written these things, that they should be so done unto
me: for it is good for me to die, rather than that any man should make
my glory void.

<span id="an_9:16">9:16</span> For if I preach the gospel, it is no
glory to me, for a necessity lieth upon me: for woe is unto me if I
preach not the gospel.

<span id="an_9:17">9:17</span> For if I do this thing willingly, I have
a reward: but if against my will, a dispensation is committed to me:

<span id="an_9:18">9:18</span> What is my reward then? That preaching
the gospel, I may deliver the gospel without charge, that I abuse not my
power in the gospel.

<span id="an_9:19">9:19</span> For whereas I was free as to all, I made
myself the servant of all, that I might gain the more.

<span id="an_9:20">9:20</span> And I became to the Jews, a Jew, that I
might gain the Jews:

<span id="an_9:21">9:21</span> To them that are under the law, as if I
were under the law, (whereas myself was not under the law,) that I might
gain them that were under the law. To them that were without the law, as
if I were without the law, (whereas I was not without the law of God,
but was in the law of Christ,) that I might gain them that were without
the law.

<span id="an_9:22">9:22</span> To the weak I became weak, that I might
gain the weak. I became all things to all men, that I might save all.

<span id="an_9:23">9:23</span> And I do all things for the gospel's
sake: that I may be made partaker thereof.

<span id="an_9:24">9:24</span> Know you not that they that run in the
race, all run indeed, but one receiveth the prize ? So run that you may
obtain.

<span id="an_9:25">9:25</span> And every one that striveth for the
mastery, refraineth himself from all things: and they indeed that they
may receive a corruptible crown; but we an incorruptible one.

<span id="an_9:26">9:26</span> I therefore so run, not as at an
uncertainty: I so fight, not as one beating the air:

<span id="an_9:27">9:27</span> But I chastise my body, and bring it into
subjection: lest perhaps, when I have preached to others, I myself
should become a castaway.

<span id="an_10:1">10:1</span> FOR I would not have you ignorant,
brethren, that our fathers were all under the cloud, and all passed
through the sea.

<span id="an_10:2">10:2</span> And all in Moses were baptized, in the
cloud, and in the sea:

<span id="an_10:3">10:3</span> And did all eat the same spiritual food,

<span id="an_10:4">10:4</span> And all drank the same spiritual drink;
(and they drank of the spiritual rock that followed them, and the rock
was Christ.)

<span id="an_10:5">10:5</span> But with most of them God was not well
pleased: for they were overthrown in the desert.

<span id="an_10:6">10:6</span> Now these things were done in a figure of
us, that we should not covet evil things as they also coveted.

<span id="an_10:7">10:7</span> Neither become ye idolaters, as some of
them, as it is written: The people sat down to eat and drink, and rose
up to play.

<span id="an_10:8">10:8</span> Neither let us commit fornication, as
some of them committed fornication, and there fell in one day three and
twenty thousand.

<span id="an_10:9">10:9</span> Neither let us tempt Christ: as some of
them tempted, and perished by the serpents.

<span id="an_10:10">10:10</span> Neither do you murmur: as some of them
murmured, and were destroyed by the destroyer.

<span id="an_10:11">10:11</span> Now all these things happened to them
in figure: and they are written for our correction, upon whom the ends
of the world are come.

<span id="an_10:12">10:12</span> Wherefore he that thinketh himself to
stand, let him take heed lest he fall.

<span id="an_10:13">10:13</span> Let no temptation take hold on you, but
such as is human. And God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be
tempted above that which you are able: but will make also with
temptation issue, that you may be able to bear it.

<span id="an_10:14">10:14</span> Wherefore, my dearly beloved, fly from
the service of idols.

<span id="an_10:15">10:15</span> I speak as to wise men: judge ye
yourselves what I say.

<span id="an_10:16">10:16</span> The chalice of benediction, which we
bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ ? And the bread,
which we break, is it not the partaking of the body of the Lord ?

<span id="an_10:17">10:17</span> For we, being many, are one bread, one
body, all that partake of one bread.

<span id="an_10:18">10:18</span> Behold Israel according to the flesh:
are not they, that eat of the sacrifices, partakers of the altar ?

<span id="an_10:19">10:19</span> What then ? Do I say, that what is
offered in sacrifice to idols, is any thing ? Or, that the idol is any
thing ?

<span id="an_10:20">10:20</span> But the things which the heathens
sacrifice, they sacrifice to devils, and not to God. And I would not
that you should be made partakers with devils.

<span id="an_10:21">10:21</span> You cannot drink the chalice of the
Lord, and the chalice of devils: you cannot be partakers of the table of
the Lord, and of the table of devils.

<span id="an_10:22">10:22</span> Do we provoke the Lord to jealousy ?
Are we stronger than he? All things are lawful for me, but all things
are not expedient.

<span id="an_10:23">10:23</span> All things are lawful for me, but all
things do not edify.

<span id="an_10:24">10:24</span> Let no man seek his own, but that which
is another's.

<span id="an_10:25">10:25</span> Whatsoever is sold in the shambles,
eat; asking no question for conscience' sake.

<span id="an_10:26">10:26</span> The earth is the Lord's, and the
fulness thereof.

<span id="an_10:27">10:27</span> If any of them that believe not, invite
you, and you will be willing to go; eat of any thing that is set before
you, asking no question for conscience' sake.

<span id="an_10:28">10:28</span> But if any man say: This has been
sacrificed to idols, do not eat of it for his sake that told it, and for
conscience' sake.

<span id="an_10:29">10:29</span> Conscience, I say, not thy own, but the
other's. For why is my liberty judged by another man's conscience ?

<span id="an_10:30">10:30</span> If I partake with thanksgiving, why am
I evil spoken of, for that for which I give thanks ?

<span id="an_10:31">10:31</span> Therefore, whether you eat or drink, or
whatsoever else you do, do all to the glory of God.

<span id="an_10:32">10:32</span> Be without offence to the Jews, and to
the Gentiles, and to the church of God:

<span id="an_10:33">10:33</span> As I also in all things please all men,
not seeking that which is profitable to myself, but to many, that may be
saved.

<span id="an_11:1">11:1</span> BE ye followers of me, as I also am of
Christ.

<span id="an_11:2">11:2</span> Now I praise you, brethren, that in all
things you are mindful of me: and keep my ordinances as I have delivered
them to you.

<span id="an_11:3">11:3</span> But I would have you know, that the head
of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman is the man; and the
head of Christ is God.

<span id="an_11:4">11:4</span> Every man praying or prophesying with his
head covered, disgraceth his head.

<span id="an_11:5">11:5</span> But every woman praying or prophesying
with her head not covered, disgraceth her head: for it is all one as if
she were shaven.

<span id="an_11:6">11:6</span> For if a woman be not covered, let her be
shorn. But if it be a shame to a woman to be shorn or made bald, let her
cover her head.

<span id="an_11:7">11:7</span> The man indeed ought not to cover his
head, because he is the image and glory of God; but the woman is the
glory of the man.

<span id="an_11:8">11:8</span> For the man is not of the woman, but the
woman of the man.

<span id="an_11:9">11:9</span> For the man was not created for the
woman, but the woman for the man.

<span id="an_11:10">11:10</span> Therefore ought the woman to have a
power over her head, because of the angels.

<span id="an_11:11">11:11</span> But yet neither is the man without the
woman, nor the woman without the man, in the Lord.

<span id="an_11:12">11:12</span> For as the woman is of the man, so also
is the man by the woman: but all things of God.

<span id="an_11:13">11:13</span> You yourselves judge: doth it become a
woman, to pray unto God uncovered?

<span id="an_11:14">11:14</span> Doth not even nature itself teach you,
that a man indeed, if he nourish his hair, it is a shame unto him?

<span id="an_11:15">11:15</span> But if a woman nourish her hair, it is
a glory to her; for her hair is given to her for a covering.

<span id="an_11:16">11:16</span> But if any man seem to be contentious,
we have no such custom, nor the church of God.

<span id="an_11:17">11:17</span> Now this I ordain: not praising you,
that you come together not for the better, but for the worse.

<span id="an_11:18">11:18</span> For first of all I hear that when you
come together in the church, there are schisms among you; and in part I
believe it.

<span id="an_11:19">11:19</span> For there must be also heresies: that
they also, who are approved, may be made manifest among you.

<span id="an_11:20">11:20</span> When you come therefore together into
one place, it is not now to eat the Lord's supper.

<span id="an_11:21">11:21</span> For every one taketh before his own
supper to eat. And one indeed is hungry and another is drunk.

<span id="an_11:22">11:22</span> What, have you not houses to eat and to
drink in? Or despise ye the church of God; and put them to shame that
have not ? What shall I say to you? Do I praise you? In this I praise
you not.

<span id="an_11:23">11:23</span> For I have received of the Lord that
which also I delivered unto you, that the Lord Jesus, the same night in
which he was betrayed, took bread.

<span id="an_11:24">11:24</span> And giving thanks, broke, and said:
Take ye, and eat: this is my body, which shall be delivered for you:
this do for the commemoration of me.

<span id="an_11:25">11:25</span> In like manner also the chalice, after
he had supped, saying: This chalice is the new testament in my blood:
this do ye, as often as you shall drink, for the commemoration of me.

<span id="an_11:26">11:26</span> For as often as you shall eat this
bread, and drink the chalice, you shall shew the death of the Lord,
until he come.

<span id="an_11:27">11:27</span> Therefore whosoever shall eat this
bread, or drink the chalice of the Lord unworthily, shall be guilty of
the body and of the blood of the Lord.

<span id="an_11:28">11:28</span> But let a man prove himself: and so let
him eat of that bread, and drink of the chalice.

<span id="an_11:29">11:29</span> For he that eateth and drinketh
unworthily, eateth and drinketh judgment to himself, not discerning the
body of the Lord.

<span id="an_11:30">11:30</span> Therefore are there many inform and
weak among you, and many sleep.

<span id="an_11:31">11:31</span> But if we would judge ourselves, we
should not be judged.

<span id="an_11:32">11:32</span> But whilst we are judged, we are
chastised by the Lord, that we be not condemned with this world.

<span id="an_11:33">11:33</span> Wherefore, my brethren, when you come
together to eat, wait for one another.

<span id="an_11:34">11:34</span> If any man be hungry, let him eat at
home; that you come not together unto judgment. And the rest I will set
in order, when I come.

<span id="an_12:1">12:1</span> NOW concerning spiritual things, my
brethren, I would not have you ignorant.

<span id="an_12:2">12:2</span> You know that when you were heathens, you
went to dumb idols, according as you were led.

<span id="an_12:3">12:3</span> Wherefore I give you to understand, that
no man, speaking by the Spirit of God, saith Anathema to Jesus. And no
man can say the Lord Jesus, but by the Holy Ghost.

<span id="an_12:4">12:4</span> Now there are diversities of graces, but
the same Spirit;

<span id="an_12:5">12:5</span> And there are diversities of ministries,
but the same Lord;

<span id="an_12:6">12:6</span> And there are diversities of operations,
but the same God, who worketh all in all.

<span id="an_12:7">12:7</span> And the manifestation of the Spirit is
given to every man unto profit.

<span id="an_12:8">12:8</span> To one indeed, by the Spirit, is given
the word of wisdom: and to another, the word of knowledge, according to
the same Spirit;

<span id="an_12:9">12:9</span> To another, faith in the same spirit; to
another, the grace of healing in one Spirit;

<span id="an_12:10">12:10</span> To another, the working of miracles; to
another, prophecy; to another, the discerning of spirits; to another,
diverse kinds of tongues; to another, interpretation of speeches.

<span id="an_12:11">12:11</span> But all these things one and the same
Spirit worketh, dividing to every one according as he will.

<span id="an_12:12">12:12</span> For as the body is one, and hath many
members; and all the members of the body, whereas they are many, yet are
one body, so also is Christ.

<span id="an_12:13">12:13</span> For in one Spirit were we all baptized
into one body, whether Jews or Gentiles, whether bond or free; and in
one Spirit we have all been made to drink.

<span id="an_12:14">12:14</span> For the body also is not one member,
but many.

<span id="an_12:15">12:15</span> If the foot should say, because I am
not the hand, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body ?

<span id="an_12:16">12:16</span> And if the ear should say, because I am
not the eye, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body ?

<span id="an_12:17">12:17</span> If the whole body were the eye, where
would be the hearing? If the whole were hearing, where would be the
smelling?

<span id="an_12:18">12:18</span> But now God hath set the members every
one of them in the body as it hath pleased him.

<span id="an_12:19">12:19</span> And if they all were one member, where
would be the body?

<span id="an_12:20">12:20</span> But now there are many members indeed,
yet one body.

<span id="an_12:21">12:21</span> And the eye cannot say to the hand: I
need not thy help; nor again the head to the feet: I have no need of
you.

<span id="an_12:22">12:22</span> Yea, much more those that seem to be
the more feeble members of the body, are more necessary.

<span id="an_12:23">12:23</span> And such as we think to be the less
honourable members of the body, about these we put more abundant honour;
and those that are our uncomely parts, have more abundant comeliness.

<span id="an_12:24">12:24</span> But our comely parts have no need: but
God hath tempered the body together, giving to that which wanted the
more abundant honour,

<span id="an_12:25">12:25</span> That there might be no schism in the
body; but the members might be mutually careful one for another.

<span id="an_12:26">12:26</span> And if one member suffer any thing, all
the members suffer with it; or if one member glory, all the members
rejoice with it.

<span id="an_12:27">12:27</span> Now you are the body of Christ, and
members of member.

<span id="an_12:28">12:28</span> And God indeed hath set some in the
church; first apostles, secondly prophets, thirdly doctors; after that
miracles; then the graces of healing, helps, governments, kinds of
tongues, interpretations of speeches.

<span id="an_12:29">12:29</span> Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Are
all doctors?

<span id="an_12:30">12:30</span> Are all workers of miracles? Have all
the grace of healing? Do all speak with tongues? Do all interpret?

<span id="an_12:31">12:31</span> But be zealous for the better gifts.
And I shew unto you yet a more excellent way.

<span id="an_13:1">13:1</span> IF I speak with the tongues of men, and
of angels, and have not charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a
tinkling cymbal.

<span id="an_13:2">13:2</span> And if I should have prophecy and should
know all mysteries, and all knowledge, and if I should have all faith,
so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing.

<span id="an_13:3">13:3</span> And if I should distribute all my goods
to feed the poor, and if I should deliver my body to be burned, and have
not charity, it profiteth me nothing.

<span id="an_13:4">13:4</span> Charity is patient, is kind: charity
envieth not, dealeth not perversely; is not puffed up;

<span id="an_13:5">13:5</span> Is not ambitious, seeketh not her own, is
not provoked to anger, thinketh no evil;

<span id="an_13:6">13:6</span> Rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth
with the truth;

<span id="an_13:7">13:7</span> Beareth all things, believeth all things,
hopeth all things, endureth all things.

<span id="an_13:8">13:8</span> Charity never falleth away: whether
prophecies shall be made void, or tongues shall cease, or knowledge
shall be destroyed.

<span id="an_13:9">13:9</span> For we know in part, and we prophesy in
part.

<span id="an_13:10">13:10</span> But when that which is perfect is come,
that which is in part shall be done away.

<span id="an_13:11">13:11</span> When I was a child, I spoke as a child,
I understood as a child, I thought as a child. But, when I became a man,
I put away the things of a child.

<span id="an_13:12">13:12</span> We see now through a glass in a dark
manner; but then face to face. Now I know I part; but then I shall know
even as I am known.

<span id="an_13:13">13:13</span> And now there remain faith, hope, and
charity, these three: but the greatest of these is charity.

<span id="an_14:1">14:1</span> FOLLOW after charity, be zealous for
spiritual gifts; but rather that you may prophesy.

<span id="an_14:2">14:2</span> For he that speaketh in a tongue,
speaketh not unto men, but unto God: for no man heareth. Yet by the
Spirit he speaketh mysteries.

<span id="an_14:3">14:3</span> But he that prophesieth, speaketh to men
unto edification, and exhortation, and comfort.

<span id="an_14:4">14:4</span> He that speaketh in a tongue, edifieth
himself: but he that prophesieth, edifieth the church.

<span id="an_14:5">14:5</span> And I would have you all to speak with
tongues, but rather to prophesy. For greater is he that prophesieth,
than he that speaketh with tongues: unless perhaps he interpret, that
the church may receive edification.

<span id="an_14:6">14:6</span> But now, brethren, if I come to you
speaking with tongues, what shall I profit you, unless I speak to you
either in revelation, or in knowledge, or in prophecy, or in doctrine?

<span id="an_14:7">14:7</span> Even things without life that give sound,
whether pipe or harp, except they give a distinction of sounds, how
shall it be known what is piped or harped ?

<span id="an_14:8">14:8</span> For if the trumpet give an uncertain
sound, who shall prepare himself to the battle ?

<span id="an_14:9">14:9</span> So likewise you, except you utter by the
tongue plain speech, how shall it be known what is said ? For you shall
be speaking into the air.

<span id="an_14:10">14:10</span> There are, for example, so many kinds
of tongues in this world; and none is without voice.

<span id="an_14:11">14:11</span> If then I know not the power of the
voice, I shall be to him to whom I speak a barbarian; and he that
speaketh, a barbarian to me.

<span id="an_14:12">14:12</span> So you also, forasmuch as you are
zealous of spirits, seek to abound unto the edifying of the church.

<span id="an_14:13">14:13</span> And therefore he that speaketh by a
tongue, let him pray that he may interpret.

<span id="an_14:14">14:14</span> For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit
prayeth, but my understanding is without fruit.

<span id="an_14:15">14:15</span> What is it then ? I will pray with the
spirit, I will pray also with the understanding; I will sing with the
spirit, I will sing also with the understanding.

<span id="an_14:16">14:16</span> Else if thou shalt bless with the
spirit, how shall he that holdeth the place of the unlearned say, Amen,
to thy blessing ? because he knoweth not what thou sayest.

<span id="an_14:17">14:17</span> For thou indeed givest thanks well, but
the other is not edified.

<span id="an_14:18">14:18</span> I thank my God I speak with all your
tongues.

<span id="an_14:19">14:19</span> But in the church I had rather speak
five words with my understanding, that I may instruct others also; than
ten thousand words in a tongue.

<span id="an_14:20">14:20</span> Brethren, do not become children in
sense: but in malice be children, and in sense be perfect.

<span id="an_14:21">14:21</span> In the law it is written: In other
tongues and other lips I will speak to this people; and neither so will
they hear me, saith the Lord.

<span id="an_14:22">14:22</span> Wherefore tongues are for a sign, not
to believers, but to unbelievers; but prophecies not to unbelievers, but
to believers.

<span id="an_14:23">14:23</span> If therefore the whole church come
together into one place, and all speak with tongues, and there come in
unlearned persons or infidels, will they not say that you are mad ?

<span id="an_14:24">14:24</span> But if all prophesy, and there come in
one that believeth not, or an unlearned person, he is convinced of all,
he is judged of all.

<span id="an_14:25">14:25</span> The secrets of his heart are made
manifest; and so, falling down on his face, he will adore God, affirming
that God is among you indeed.

<span id="an_14:26">14:26</span> How is it then, brethren ? When you
come together, every one of you hath a psalm, hath a doctrine, hath a
revelation, hath a tongue, hath an interpretation: let all things be
done to edification.

<span id="an_14:27">14:27</span> If any speak with a tongue, let it be
by two, or at the most by three, and in course, and let one interpret.

<span id="an_14:28">14:28</span> But if there be no interpreter, let him
hold his peace in the church, and speak to himself and to God.

<span id="an_14:29">14:29</span> And let the prophets speak, two or
three; and let the rest judge.

<span id="an_14:30">14:30</span> But if any thing be revealed to another
sitting, let the first hold his peace.

<span id="an_14:31">14:31</span> For you may all prophesy one by one;
that all may learn, and all may be exhorted:

<span id="an_14:32">14:32</span> And the spirits of the prophets are
subject to the prophets.

<span id="an_14:33">14:33</span> For God is not the God of dissension,
but of peace: as also I teach in all the churches of the saints.

<span id="an_14:34">14:34</span> Let women keep silence in the churches:
for it is not permitted them to speak, but to be subject, as also the
law saith.

<span id="an_14:35">14:35</span> But if they would learn any thing, let
them ask their husbands at home. For it is a shame for a woman to speak
in the church.

<span id="an_14:36">14:36</span> Or did the word of God come out from
you ? Or came it only unto you ?

<span id="an_14:37">14:37</span> If any seem to be a prophet, or
spiritual, let him know the things that I write to you, that they are
the commandments of the Lord.

<span id="an_14:38">14:38</span> But if any man know not, he shall not
be known.

<span id="an_14:39">14:39</span> Wherefore, brethren, be zealous to
prophesy; and forbid not to speak with tongues.

<span id="an_14:40">14:40</span> But let all things be done decently,
and according to order.

<span id="an_15:1">15:1</span> NOW I make known unto you, brethren, the
gospel which I preached to you, which also you have received, and
wherein you stand;

<span id="an_15:2">15:2</span> By which also you are saved, if you hold
fast after what manner I preached unto you, unless you have believed in
vain.

<span id="an_15:3">15:3</span> For I delivered unto you first of all,
which I also received: how that Christ died for our sins, according to
the scriptures:

<span id="an_15:4">15:4</span> And that he was buried, and that he rose
again the third day, according to the scriptures:

<span id="an_15:5">15:5</span> And that he was seen by Cephas; and after
that by the eleven.

<span id="an_15:6">15:6</span> Then he was seen by more than five
hundred brethren at once: of whom many remain until this present, and
some are fallen asleep.

<span id="an_15:7">15:7</span> After that, he was seen by James, then by
all the apostles.

<span id="an_15:8">15:8</span> And last of all, he was seen also by me,
as by one born out of due time.

<span id="an_15:9">15:9</span> For I am the least of the apostles, who
am not worthy to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church
of God.

<span id="an_15:10">15:10</span> But by the grace of God, I am what I
am; and his grace in me hath not been void, but I have laboured more
abundantly than all they: yet not I, but the grace of God with me.

<span id="an_15:11">15:11</span> For whether I, or they, so we preach,
and so you have believed.

<span id="an_15:12">15:12</span> Now if Christ be preached, that he
arose again from the dead, how do some among you say, that there is no
resurrection of the dead?

<span id="an_15:13">15:13</span> But if there be no resurrection of the
dead, then Christ is not risen again.

<span id="an_15:14">15:14</span> And if Christ be not risen again, then
is our preaching vain, and your faith is also vain.

<span id="an_15:15">15:15</span> Yea, and we are found false witnesses
of God: because we have given testimony against God, that he hath raised
up Christ; whom he hath not raised up, if the dead rise not again.

<span id="an_15:16">15:16</span> For if the dead rise not again, neither
is Christ risen again.

<span id="an_15:17">15:17</span> And if Christ be not risen again, your
faith is vain, for you are yet in your sins.

<span id="an_15:18">15:18</span> Then they also that are fallen asleep
in Christ, are perished.

<span id="an_15:19">15:19</span> If in this life only we have hope in
Christ, we are of all men most miserable.

<span id="an_15:20">15:20</span> But now Christ is risen from the dead,
the firstfruits of them that sleep :

<span id="an_15:21">15:21</span> For by a man came death, and by a man
the resurrection of the dead.

<span id="an_15:22">15:22</span> And as in Adam all die, so also in
Christ all shall be made alive.

<span id="an_15:23">15:23</span> But every one in his own order: the
firstfruits Christ, then they that are of Christ, who have believed in
his coming.

<span id="an_15:24">15:24</span> Afterwards the end, when he shall have
delivered up the kingdom to God and the Father, when he shall have
brought to nought all principality, and power, and virtue.

<span id="an_15:25">15:25</span> For he must reign, until he hath put
all his enemies under his feet.

<span id="an_15:26">15:26</span> And the enemy death shall be destroyed
last: For he hath put all things under his feet. And whereas he saith,

<span id="an_15:27">15:27</span> All things are put under him;
undoubtedly, he is excepted, who put all things under him.

<span id="an_15:28">15:28</span> And when all things shall be subdued
unto him, then the Son also himself shall be subject unto him that put
all things under him, that God may be all in all.

<span id="an_15:29">15:29</span> Otherwise what shall they do that are
baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not again at all? why are they
then baptized for them?

<span id="an_15:30">15:30</span> Why also are we in danger every hour?

<span id="an_15:31">15:31</span> I die daily, I protest by your glory,
brethren, which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord.

<span id="an_15:32">15:32</span> If (according to man) I fought with
beasts at Ephesus, what doth it profit me, if the dead rise not again?
Let us eat and drink, for to morrow we shall die.

<span id="an_15:33">15:33</span> Be not seduced: Evil communications
corrupt good manners.

<span id="an_15:34">15:34</span> Awake, ye just, and sin not. For some
have not the knowledge of God, I speak it to your shame.

<span id="an_15:35">15:35</span> But some man will say: How do the dead
rise again? or with what manner of body shall they come?

<span id="an_15:36">15:36</span> Senseless man, that which thou sowest
is not quickened, except it die first.

<span id="an_15:37">15:37</span> And that which thou sowest, thou sowest
not the body that shall be; but bare grain, as of wheat, or of some of
the rest.

<span id="an_15:38">15:38</span> But God giveth it a body as he will:
and to every seed its proper body.

<span id="an_15:39">15:39</span> All flesh is not the same flesh: but
one is the flesh of men, another of beasts, another of birds, another of
fishes.

<span id="an_15:40">15:40</span> And there are bodies celestial, and
bodies terrestrial: but, one is the glory of the celestial, and another
of the terrestrial.

<span id="an_15:41">15:41</span> One is the glory of the sun, another
the glory of the moon, and another the glory of the stars. For star
differeth from star in glory.

<span id="an_15:42">15:42</span> So also is the resurrection of the
dead. It is sown in corruption, it shall rise in incorruption.

<span id="an_15:43">15:43</span> It is sown in dishonour, it shall rise
in glory. It is sown in weakness, it shall rise in power.

<span id="an_15:44">15:44</span> It is sown a natural body, it shall
rise a spiritual body. If there be a natural body, there is also a
spiritual body, as it is written:

<span id="an_15:45">15:45</span> The first man Adam was made into a
living soul; the last Adam into a quickening spirit.

<span id="an_15:46">15:46</span> Yet that was not first which is
spiritual, but that which is natural; afterwards that which is
spiritual.

<span id="an_15:47">15:47</span> The first man was of the earth,
earthly: the second man, from heaven, heavenly.

<span id="an_15:48">15:48</span> Such as is the earthly, such also are
the earthly: and such as is the heavenly, such also are they that are
heavenly.

<span id="an_15:49">15:49</span> Therefore as we have borne the image of
the earthly, let us bear also the image of the heavenly.

<span id="an_15:50">15:50</span> Now this I say, brethren, that flesh
and blood cannot possess the kingdom of God: neither shall corruption
possess incorruption.

<span id="an_15:51">15:51</span> Behold, I tell you a mystery. We shall
all indeed rise again: but we shall not all be changed.

<span id="an_15:52">15:52</span> In a moment, in the twinkling of an
eye, at the last trumpet: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead
shall rise again incorruptible: and we shall be changed.

<span id="an_15:53">15:53</span> For this corruptible must put on
incorruption; and this mortal must put on immortality.

<span id="an_15:54">15:54</span> And when this mortal hath put on
immortality, then shall come to pass the saying that is written: Death
is swallowed up in victory.

<span id="an_15:55">15:55</span> O death, where is thy victory? O death,
where is thy sting?

<span id="an_15:56">15:56</span> Now the sting of death is sin: and the
power of sin is the law.

<span id="an_15:57">15:57</span> But thanks be to God, who hath given us
the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.

<span id="an_15:58">15:58</span> Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye
steadfast and unmoveable; always abounding in the work of the Lord,
knowing that your labour is not in vain in the Lord.

<span id="an_16:1">16:1</span> NOW concerning the collections that are
made for the saints, as I have given order to the churches of Galatia,
so do ye also.

<span id="an_16:2">16:2</span> On the first day of the week let every
one of you put apart with himself, laying up what it shall well please
him; that when I come, the collections be not then to be made.

<span id="an_16:3">16:3</span> And when I shall be with you, whomsoever
you shall approve by letters, them will I send to carry your grace to
Jerusalem.

<span id="an_16:4">16:4</span> And if it be meet that I also go, they
shall go with me.

<span id="an_16:5">16:5</span> Now I will come to you, when I shall have
passed through Macedonia. For I shall pass through Macedonia.

<span id="an_16:6">16:6</span> And with you perhaps I shall abide, or
even spend the winter: that you may bring me on my way whithersoever I
shall go.

<span id="an_16:7">16:7</span> For I will not see you now by the way,
for I trust that I shall abide with you some time, if the Lord permit.

<span id="an_16:8">16:8</span> But I will tarry at Ephesus until
Pentecost.

<span id="an_16:9">16:9</span> For a great door and evident is opened
unto me: and many adversaries.

<span id="an_16:10">16:10</span> Now if Timothy come, see that he be
with you without fear, for he worketh the work of the Lord, as I also
do.

<span id="an_16:11">16:11</span> Let no man therefore despise him, but
conduct ye him on his way in peace: that he may come to me. For I look
for him with the breatheren.

<span id="an_16:12">16:12</span> And touching our brother Apollo, I give
you to understand, that I much entreated him to come unto you with the
breatheren: and indeed it was not his will at all to come at this time.
But he will come when he shall have leisure.

<span id="an_16:13">16:13</span> Watch ye, stand fast in the faith,do
manfully, and be strengthened.

<span id="an_16:14">16:14</span> Let all your things be done in charity.

<span id="an_16:15">16:15</span> And I beseech you, brethren, you know
the house of Stephanas, and of Fortunatus, and of Achaicus, that they
are the firstfruits of Achaia, and have dedicated themselves to the
ministry of the saints:

<span id="an_16:16">16:16</span> That you also be subject to such, and
to every one that worketh with us, and laboureth.

<span id="an_16:17">16:17</span> And I rejoice in the presence of
Stephanas, and Fortunatus, and Achaicus, because that which was wanting
on your part, they have supplied.

<span id="an_16:18">16:18</span> For they have refreshed both my spirit
and yours. Know them, therefore, that are such.

<span id="an_16:19">16:19</span> The churches of Asia salute you. Aquila
and Priscilla salute you much in the Lord, with the church that is in
their house, with whom I also lodge.

<span id="an_16:20">16:20</span> All the brethren salute you. Salute one
another with a holy kiss.

<span id="an_16:21">16:21</span> The salutation of me Paul, with my own
hand.

<span id="an_16:22">16:22</span> If any man love not our Lord Jesus
Christ, let him be anathema, maranatha.

<span id="an_16:23">16:23</span> The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be
with you.

<span id="an_16:24">16:24</span> My charity be with you all in Christ
Jesus. Amen.
