### Douay-Rheims Bible: Jonah

<span id="an_1:1">1:1</span> Now the word of the Lord came to Jonas the
son of Amathi, saying:

<span id="an_1:2">1:2</span> Arise, and go to Ninive the great city, and
preach in it: for the wickedness thereof is come up before me.

<span id="an_1:3">1:3</span> And Jonas rose up to flee into Tharsis from
the face of the Lord, and he went down to Joppe, and found a ship going
to Tharsis: and he paid the fare thereof, and went down into it, to go
with them to Tharsis from the face of the Lord.

<span id="an_1:4">1:4</span> But the Lord sent a great wind into the
sea: and a great tempest was raised in the sea, and the ship was in
danger to be broken.

<span id="an_1:5">1:5</span> And the mariners were afraid, and the men
cried to their god: and they cast forth the wares that were in the ship,
into the sea, to lighten it of them: and Jones went down into the inner
part of the ship, and fell into a deep sleep.

<span id="an_1:6">1:6</span> And the shipmaster came to him, and said to
him: Why art thou fast asleep? rise up, call upon thy God, if so be that
God will think of us, that we may not perish.

<span id="an_1:7">1:7</span> And they said every one to his fellow:
Come, and let us cast lots, that we may know why this evil is upon us.
And they cast lots, and the lot fell upon Jonas.

<span id="an_1:8">1:8</span> And they said to him: Tell us for what
cause this evil is upon us, what is thy business? of what country art
thou? and whither goest thou? or of what people art thou?

<span id="an_1:9">1:9</span> And he said to them: I am a Hebrew, and I
fear the Lord the God of heaven, who made both the sea and the dry land.

<span id="an_1:10">1:10</span> And the men were greatly afraid, and they
said to him: Why hast thou done this? (for the men knew that he fled
from the face of the Lord: because he had told them.)

<span id="an_1:11">1:11</span> And they said to him: What shall we do to
thee, that the sea may be calm to us? for the sea flowed and swelled.

<span id="an_1:12">1:12</span> And he said to them: Take me up, and cast
me into the sea, and the sea shall be calm to you: for I know that for
my sake this great tempest is upon you.

<span id="an_1:13">1:13</span> And the men rowed hard to return to land,
but they were not able: because the sea tossed and swelled upon them.

<span id="an_1:14">1:14</span> And they cried to the Lord, and said: We
beseech thee, O Lord, let us not perish for this man's life, and lay not
upon us innocent blood: for thou, O Lord, hast done as it pleased thee.

<span id="an_1:15">1:15</span> And they took Jonas, and cast him into
the sea, and the sea ceased from raging.

<span id="an_1:16">1:16</span> And the men feared the Lord exceedingly,
and sacrificed victims to the Lord, and made vows.

<span id="an_2:1">2:1</span> Now the Lord prepared a great fish to
swallow up Jonas: and Jonas was in the belly of the fish three days and
three nights.

<span id="an_2:2">2:2</span> And Jonas prayed to the Lord his God out of
the belly of the fish.

<span id="an_2:3">2:3</span> And he said: I cried out of my affliction
to the Lord, and he heard me: I cried out of the belly of hell, and thou
hast heard my voice.

<span id="an_2:4">2:4</span> And thou hast cast me forth into the deep
in the heart of the sea, and a flood hath compassed me: all thy billows,
and thy waves have passed over me.

<span id="an_2:5">2:5</span> And I said: I am cast away out of the sight
of thy eyes: but yet I shall see thy holy temple again.

<span id="an_2:6">2:6</span> The waters compassed me about even to the
soul: the deep hath closed me round about, the sea hath covered my head.

<span id="an_2:7">2:7</span> I went down to the lowest parts of the
mountains: the bars of the earth have shut me up for ever: and thou wilt
bring up my life from corruption, O Lord my God.

<span id="an_2:8">2:8</span> When my soul was in distress within me, I
remembered the Lord: that my prayer may come to thee, unto thy holy
temple.

<span id="an_2:9">2:9</span> They that are vain observe vanities,
forsake their own mercy.

<span id="an_2:10">2:10</span> But I with the voice of praise will
sacrifice to thee: I will pay whatsoever I have vowed for my salvation
to the Lord.

<span id="an_2:11">2:11</span> And the Lord spoke to the fish: and it
vomited out Jonas upon the dry land.

<span id="an_3:1">3:1</span> And the word of the Lord came to Jonas the
second time, saying:

<span id="an_3:2">3:2</span> Arise, and go to Ninive the great city: and
preach in it the preaching that I bid thee.

<span id="an_3:3">3:3</span> And Jonas arose, and went to Ninive,
according to the word of the Lord: now Ninive was a great city of three
days' journey.

<span id="an_3:4">3:4</span> And Jonas began to enter into the city one
day's journey: and he cried, and said: Yet forty days, and Ninive shall
be destroyed.

<span id="an_3:5">3:5</span> And the men of Ninive believed in God: and
they proclaimed a fast, and put on sackcloth from the greatest to the
least.

<span id="an_3:6">3:6</span> And the word came to the king of Ninive;
and he rose up out of his throne, and cast away his robe from him, and
was clothed with sackcloth, and sat in ashes.

<span id="an_3:7">3:7</span> And he caused it to be proclaimed and
published in Ninive from the mouth of the king and of his princes,
saying: Let neither men nor beasts, oxen nor sheep, taste any thing: let
them not feed, nor drink water.

<span id="an_3:8">3:8</span> And let men and beasts be covered with
sackcloth, and cry to the Lord with all their strength, and let them
turn every one from his evil way, and from the iniquity that is in their
hands.

<span id="an_3:9">3:9</span> Who can tell if God will turn, and forgive:
and will turn away from his fierce anger, and we shall not perish?

<span id="an_3:10">3:10</span> And God saw their works, that they were
turned from their evil way: and God had mercy with regard to the evil
which he had said that he would do to them, and he did it not.

<span id="an_4:1">4:1</span> And Jonas was exceedingly troubled, and was
angry:

<span id="an_4:2">4:2</span> And he prayed to the Lord, and said: I
beseech thee, O Lord, is not this what I said, when I was yet in my own
country? therefore I went before to flee into Tharsis: for I know that
thou art a gracious and merciful God, patient, and of much compassion,
and easy to forgive evil.

<span id="an_4:3">4:3</span> And now, O Lord, I beseech thee take my
life from me: for it is better for me to die than to live.

<span id="an_4:4">4:4</span> And the Lord said: Dost thou think thou
hast reason to be angry?

<span id="an_4:5">4:5</span> Then Jonas went out of the city, and sat
toward the east side of the city: and he made himself a booth there, and
he sat under it in the shadow, till he might see what would befall the
city.

<span id="an_4:6">4:6</span> And the Lord God prepared an ivy, and it
came up over the head of Jonas, to be a shadow over his head, and to
cover him (for he was fatigued): and Jonas was exceeding glad of the
ivy.

<span id="an_4:7">4:7</span> But God prepared a worm, when the morning
arose on the following day: and it struck the ivy and it withered.

<span id="an_4:8">4:8</span> And when the sun was risen, the Lord
commanded a hot and burning wind: and the sun beat upon the head of
Jonas, and he broiled with the heat: and he desired for his soul that he
might die, and said: It is better for me to die than to live.

<span id="an_4:9">4:9</span> And the Lord said to Jonas: Dost thou think
thou hast reason to be angry, for the ivy? And he said: I am angry with
reason even unto death.

<span id="an_4:10">4:10</span> And the Lord said: Thou art grieved for
the ivy, for which thou hast not laboured, nor made it to grow, which in
one night came up, and in one night perished.

<span id="an_4:11">4:11</span> And shall not I spare Ninive, that great
city, in which there are more than a hundred and twenty thousand persons
that know not how to distinguish between their right hand and their
left, and many beasts?
