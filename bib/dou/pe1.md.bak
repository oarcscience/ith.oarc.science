### Douay-Rheims Bible: 1 Peter

<span id="an_1:1">1:1</span> Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the
strangers dispersed through Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and
Bithynia, elect,

<span id="an_1:2">1:2</span> According to the foreknowledge of God the
Father, unto the sanctification of the Spirit, unto obedience and
sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ: Grace unto you and peace be
multiplied.

<span id="an_1:3">1:3</span> Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord
Jesus Christ, who according to his great mercy hath regenerated us unto
a lively hope, by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,

<span id="an_1:4">1:4</span> Unto an inheritance incorruptible, and
undefiled, and that can not fade, reserved in heaven for you,

<span id="an_1:5">1:5</span> Who, by the power of God, are kept by faith
unto salvation, ready to be revealed in the last time.

<span id="an_1:6">1:6</span> Wherein you shall greatly rejoice, if now
you must be for a little time made sorrowful in divers temptations:

<span id="an_1:7">1:7</span> That the trial of your faith (much more
precious than gold which is tried by the fire) may be found unto praise
and glory and honour at the appearing of Jesus Christ:

<span id="an_1:8">1:8</span> Whom having not seen, you love: in whom
also now, though you see him not, you believe: and believing shall
rejoice with joy unspeakable and glorified;

<span id="an_1:9">1:9</span> Receiving the end of your faith, even the
salvation of your souls.

<span id="an_1:10">1:10</span> Of which salvation the prophets have
inquired and diligently searched, who prophesied of the grace to come in
you.

<span id="an_1:11">1:11</span> Searching what or what manner of time the
Spirit of Christ in them did signify: when it foretold those sufferings
that are in Christ, and the glories that should follow:

<span id="an_1:12">1:12</span> To whom it was revealed, that not to
themselves, but to you they ministered those things which are now
declared to you by them that have preached the gospel to you, the Holy
Ghost being sent down from heaven, on whom the angels desire to look.

<span id="an_1:13">1:13</span> Wherefore having the loins of your mind
girt up, being sober, trust perfectly in the grace which is offered you
in the revelation of Jesus Christ,

<span id="an_1:14">1:14</span> As children of obedience, not fashioned
according to the former desires of your ignorance:

<span id="an_1:15">1:15</span> But according to him that hath called
you, who is holy, be you also in all manner of conversation holy:

<span id="an_1:16">1:16</span> Because it is written: You shall be holy,
for I am holy.

<span id="an_1:17">1:17</span> And if you invoke as Father him who,
without respect of persons, judgeth according to every one's work:
converse in fear during the time of your sojourning here.

<span id="an_1:18">1:18</span> Knowing that you were not redeemed with
corruptible things as gold or silver, from your vain conversation of the
tradition of your fathers:

<span id="an_1:19">1:19</span> But with the precious blood of Christ, as
of a lamb unspotted and undefiled,

<span id="an_1:20">1:20</span> Foreknown indeed before the foundation of
the world, but manifested in the last times for you,

<span id="an_1:21">1:21</span> Who through him are faithful in God, who
raised him up from the dead, and hath given him glory, that your faith
and hope might be in God.

<span id="an_1:22">1:22</span> Purifying your souls in the obedience of
charity, with a brotherly love, from a sincere heart love one another
earnestly:

<span id="an_1:23">1:23</span> Being born again not of corruptible seed,
but incorruptible, by the word of God who liveth and remaineth for ever.

<span id="an_1:24">1:24</span> For all flesh is as grass; and all the
glory thereof as the flower of grass. The grass is withered, and the
flower thereof is fallen away.

<span id="an_1:25">1:25</span> But the word of the Lord endureth for
ever. And this is the word which by the gospel hath been preached unto
you.

<span id="an_2:1">2:1</span> Wherefore laying away all malice, and all
guile, and dissimulations, and envies, and all detractions,

<span id="an_2:2">2:2</span> As newborn babes, desire the rational milk
without guile, that thereby you may grow unto salvation:

<span id="an_2:3">2:3</span> If so be you have tasted that the Lord is
sweet.

<span id="an_2:4">2:4</span> Unto whom coming, as to a living stone,
rejected indeed by men, but chosen and made honourable by God:

<span id="an_2:5">2:5</span> Be you also as living stones built up, a
spiritual house, a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices,
acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.

<span id="an_2:6">2:6</span> Wherefore it is said in the scripture:
Behold, I lay in Sion a chief corner stone, elect, precious. And he that
shall believe in him, shall not be confounded.

<span id="an_2:7">2:7</span> To you therefore that believe, he is
honour: but to them that believe not, the stone which the builders
rejected, the same is made the head of the corner:

<span id="an_2:8">2:8</span> And a stone of stumbling, and a rock of
scandal, to them who stumble at the word, neither do believe, whereunto
also they are set.

<span id="an_2:9">2:9</span> But you are a chosen generation, a kingly
priesthood, a holy nation, a purchased people: that you may declare his
virtues, who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light:

<span id="an_2:10">2:10</span> Who in time past were not a people: but
are now the people of God. Who had not obtained mercy; but now have
obtained mercy.

<span id="an_2:11">2:11</span> Dearly beloved, I beseech you as
strangers and pilgrims, to refrain yourselves from carnal desires which
war against the soul,

<span id="an_2:12">2:12</span> Having your conversation good among the
Gentiles: that whereas they speak against you as evildoers, they may, by
the good works, which they shall behold in you, glorify God in the day
of visitation.

<span id="an_2:13">2:13</span> Be ye subject therefore to every human
creature for God's sake: whether it be to the king as excelling;

<span id="an_2:14">2:14</span> Or to governors as sent by him for the
punishment of evildoers, and for the praise of the good:

<span id="an_2:15">2:15</span> For so is the will of God, that by doing
well you may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men:

<span id="an_2:16">2:16</span> As free, and not as making liberty a
cloak for malice, but as the servants of God.

<span id="an_2:17">2:17</span> Honour all men. Love the brotherhood.
Fear God. Honour the king.

<span id="an_2:18">2:18</span> Servants, be subject to your masters with
all fear, not only to the good and gentle, but also to the froward.

<span id="an_2:19">2:19</span> For this is thankworthy, if for
conscience towards God, a man endure sorrows, suffering wrongfully.

<span id="an_2:20">2:20</span> For what glory is it, if committing sin,
and being buffeted for it, you endure? But if doing well you suffer
patiently; this is thankworthy before God.

<span id="an_2:21">2:21</span> For unto this are you called: because
Christ also suffered for us, leaving you an example that you should
follow his steps.

<span id="an_2:22">2:22</span> Who did no sin, neither was guile found
in his mouth.

<span id="an_2:23">2:23</span> Who, when he was reviled, did not revile:
when he suffered, he threatened not: but delivered himself to him that
judged him unjustly.

<span id="an_2:24">2:24</span> Who his own self bore our sins in his
body upon the tree: that we, being dead to sins, should live to justice:
by whose stripes you were healed.

<span id="an_2:25">2:25</span> For you were as sheep going astray; but
you are now converted to the shepherd and bishop of your souls.

<span id="an_3:1">3:1</span> In like manner also let wives be subject to
their husbands: that if any believe not the word, they may be won
without the word, by the conversation of the wives.

<span id="an_3:2">3:2</span> Considering your chaste conversation with
fear.

<span id="an_3:3">3:3</span> Whose adorning let it not be the outward
plaiting of the hair, or the wearing of gold, or the putting on of
apparel:

<span id="an_3:4">3:4</span> But the hidden man of the heart in the
incorruptibility of a quiet and a meek spirit, which is rich in the
sight of God.

<span id="an_3:5">3:5</span> For after this manner heretofore the holy
women also, who trusted in God, adorned themselves, being in subjection
to their own husbands:

<span id="an_3:6">3:6</span> As Sara obeyed Abraham, calling him lord:
whose daughters you are, doing well, and not fearing any disturbance.

<span id="an_3:7">3:7</span> Ye husbands, likewise dwelling with them
according to knowledge, giving honour to the female as to the weaker
vessel, and as to the co-heirs of the grace of life: that your prayers
be not hindered.

<span id="an_3:8">3:8</span> And in fine, be ye all of one mind, having
compassion one of another, being lovers of the brotherhood, merciful,
modest, humble:

<span id="an_3:9">3:9</span> Not rendering evil for evil, nor railing
for railing, but contrariwise, blessing: for unto this are you called,
that you may inherit a blessing.

<span id="an_3:10">3:10</span> For he that will love life, and see good
days, let him refrain his tongue from evil, and his lips that they speak
no guile.

<span id="an_3:11">3:11</span> Let him decline from evil, and do good:
let him seek after peace and pursue it:

<span id="an_3:12">3:12</span> Because the eyes of the Lord are upon the
just, and his ears unto their prayers: but the countenance of the Lord
upon them that do evil things.

<span id="an_3:13">3:13</span> And who is he that can hurt you, if you
be zealous of good?

<span id="an_3:14">3:14</span> But if also you suffer any thing for
justice' sake, blessed are ye. And be not afraid of their fear, and be
not troubled.

<span id="an_3:15">3:15</span> But sanctify the Lord Christ in your
hearts, being ready always to satisfy every one that asketh you a reason
of that hope which is in you.

<span id="an_3:16">3:16</span> But with modesty and fear, having a good
conscience: that whereas they speak evil of you, they may be ashamed who
falsely accuse your good conversation in Christ.

<span id="an_3:17">3:17</span> For it is better doing well (if such be
the will of God) to suffer, than doing ill.

<span id="an_3:18">3:18</span> Because Christ also died once for our
sins, the just for the unjust: that he might offer us to God, being put
to death indeed in the flesh, but enlivened in the spirit,

<span id="an_3:19">3:19</span> In which also coming he preached to those
spirits that were in prison:

<span id="an_3:20">3:20</span> Which had been some time incredulous,
when they waited for the patience of God in the days of Noe, when the
ark was a building: wherein a few, that is, eight souls, were saved by
water.

<span id="an_3:21">3:21</span> Whereunto baptism being of the like form,
now saveth you also: not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but
the examination of a good conscience towards God by the resurrection of
Jesus Christ.

<span id="an_3:22">3:22</span> Who is on the right hand of God,
swallowing down death, that we might be made heirs of life everlasting:
being gone into heaven, the angels and powers and virtues being made
subject to him.

<span id="an_4:1">4:1</span> Christ therefore having suffered in the
flesh, be you also armed with the same thought: for he that hath
suffered in the flesh, hath ceased from sins:

<span id="an_4:2">4:2</span> That now he may live the rest of his time
in the flesh , not after the desires of men, but according to the will
of God.

<span id="an_4:3">4:3</span> For the time past is sufficient to have
fulfilled the will of the Gentiles, for them who have walked in
riotousness, lusts, excess of wine, revellings, banquetings, and
unlawful worshipping of idols.

<span id="an_4:4">4:4</span> Wherein they think it strange, that you run
not with them into the same confusion of riotousness, speaking evil of
you.

<span id="an_4:5">4:5</span> Who shall render account to him, who is
ready to judge the living and the dead.

<span id="an_4:6">4:6</span> For, for this cause was the gospel preached
also to the dead: that they might be judged indeed according to men, in
the flesh; but may live according to God, in the Spirit.

<span id="an_4:7">4:7</span> But the end of all is at hand. Be prudent
therefore, and watch in prayers.

<span id="an_4:8">4:8</span> But before all things have a constant
mutual charity among yourselves: for charity covereth a multitude of
sins.

<span id="an_4:9">4:9</span> Using hospitality one towards another,
without murmuring,

<span id="an_4:10">4:10</span> As every man hath received grace,
ministering the same one to another: as good stewards of the manifold
grace of God.

<span id="an_4:11">4:11</span> If any man speak, let him speak, as the
words of God. If any man minister, let him do it, as of the power, which
God administereth: that in all things God may be honoured through Jesus
Christ: to whom is glory and empire for ever and ever. Amen.

<span id="an_4:12">4:12</span> Dearly beloved, think not strange the
burning heat which is to try you, as if some new thing happened to you;

<span id="an_4:13">4:13</span> But if you partake of the sufferings of
Christ, rejoice that when his glory shall be revealed, you may also be
glad with exceeding joy.

<span id="an_4:14">4:14</span> If you be reproached for the name of
Christ, you shall be blessed: for that which is of the honour, glory,
and power of God, and that which is his Spirit, resteth upon you.

<span id="an_4:15">4:15</span> But let none of you suffer as a murderer,
or a thief, or a railer, or a coveter of other men's things.

<span id="an_4:16">4:16</span> But if as a Christian, let him not be
ashamed, but let him glorify God in that name.

<span id="an_4:17">4:17</span> For the time is, that judgment should
begin at the house of God. And if first at us, what shall be the end of
them that believe not the gospel of God?

<span id="an_4:18">4:18</span> And if the just man shall scarcely be
saved, where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear?

<span id="an_4:19">4:19</span> Wherefore let them also that suffer
according to the will of God, commend their souls in good deeds to the
faithful Creator.

<span id="an_5:1">5:1</span> The ancients therefore that are among you,
I beseech, who am myself also an ancient, and a witness of the
sufferings of Christ: as also a partaker of that glory which is to be
revealed in time to come:

<span id="an_5:2">5:2</span> Feed the flock of God which is among you,
taking care of it, not by constraint, but willingly, according to God:
not for filthy lucre's sake, but voluntarily:

<span id="an_5:3">5:3</span> Neither as lording it over the clergy, but
being made a pattern of the flock from the heart.

<span id="an_5:4">5:4</span> And when the prince of pastors shall
appear, you shall receive a never fading crown of glory.

<span id="an_5:5">5:5</span> In like manner, ye young men, be subject to
the ancients. And do you all insinuate humility one to another, for God
resisteth the proud, but to the humble he giveth grace.

<span id="an_5:6">5:6</span> Be you humbled therefore under the mighty
hand of God, that he may exalt you in the time of visitation:

<span id="an_5:7">5:7</span> Casting all your care upon him, for he hath
care of you.

<span id="an_5:8">5:8</span> Be sober and watch: because your adversary
the devil, as a roaring lion, goeth about seeking whom he may devour.

<span id="an_5:9">5:9</span> Whom resist ye, strong in faith: knowing
that the same affliction befalls your brethren who are in the world.

<span id="an_5:10">5:10</span> But the God of all grace, who hath called
us into his eternal glory in Christ Jesus, after you have suffered a
little, will himself perfect you, and confirm you, and establish you.

<span id="an_5:11">5:11</span> To him be glory and empire for ever and
ever. Amen.

<span id="an_5:12">5:12</span> By Sylvanus, a faithful brother unto you,
as I think, I have written briefly: beseeching and testifying that this
is the true grace of God, wherein you stand.

<span id="an_5:13">5:13</span> The church that is in Babylon, elected
together with you, saluteth you: and so doth my son Mark.

<span id="an_5:14">5:14</span> Salute one another with a holy kiss.
Grace be to all you, who are in Christ Jesus. Amen.
