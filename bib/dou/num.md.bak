### Douay-Rheims Bible: Numbers

<span id="an_1:1">1:1</span> And the Lord spoke to Moses in the desert
of Sinai in the tabernacle of the covenant, the first day of the second
month, the second year of their going out of Egypt, saying:

<span id="an_1:2">1:2</span> Take the sum of all the congregation of the
children of Israel by their families, and houses, and the names of every
one, as many as are of the male sex,

<span id="an_1:3">1:3</span> From twenty years old and upwards, of all
the men of Israel fit for war, and you shall number them by their
troops, thou and Aaron.

<span id="an_1:18">1:18</span> And assembled them on the first day of
the second month, reckoning them up by the kindreds, and houses, and

<span id="an_1:44">1:44</span> These era they who were numbered by Moses
and Aaron, and the twelve princes of Israel, every one by the houses of
their kindreds.

<span id="an_1:45">1:45</span> And the whole number of the children of
Israel by their houses and families, from twenty years old and upward,
that were able to go to war,

<span id="an_1:46">1:46</span> Were six hundred and three thousand five
hundred and fifty men.

<span id="an_1:47">1:47</span> But the Levites in the tribes of their
families were not numbered with them.

<span id="an_1:48">1:48</span> And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:

<span id="an_1:49">1:49</span> Number not the tribe of Levi, neither
shalt thou put down the sum of them with the children of Israel:

<span id="an_1:50">1:50</span> But appoint them over the tabernacle of
the testimony, and all the vessels thereof, and whatsoever pertaineth to
the ceremonies. They shall carry the tabernacle and all the furniture
thereof: and they shall minister, and shall encamp round about the
tabernacle.

<span id="an_1:51">1:51</span> When you are to go forward, the Levites
shall take down the tabernacle: when you are to camp, they shall set it
up. What stranger soever cometh to it, shall be slain.

<span id="an_1:52">1:52</span> And the children of Israel shall camp
every man by his troops and bands and army.

<span id="an_1:53">1:53</span> But the Levites shall pitch their tents
round about the tabernacle, lest there come indignation upon the
multitude of the children of Israel, and they shall keep watch, and
guard the tabernacle of the testimony.

<span id="an_1:54">1:54</span> And the children of Israel did according
to all things which the Lord had commanded Moses.

<span id="an_2:1">2:1</span> And the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron,
saying:

<span id="an_2:2">2:2</span> All the children of Israel shall camp by
their troops, ensigns, and standards, and the houses of their kindreds,
round about the tabernacle of the covenant.

<span id="an_2:3">2:3</span> On the east Juda shall pitch his tents by
the bands of his army: and the prince of his sons shall be Nahasson the
son of Aminadab.

<span id="an_2:4">2:4</span> And the whole sum of the fighting men of
his stock, were seventy-four thousand six hundred.

<span id="an_2:5">2:5</span> Next unto him they of the tribe of Issachar
encamped, whose prince was Nathanael, the son of Suar.

<span id="an_2:6">2:6</span> And the whole number of his fighting men
were fifty-four thousand four hundred.

<span id="an_2:7">2:7</span> In the tribe of Zabulon the prince was
Eliab the son of Helon.

<span id="an_2:8">2:8</span> And all the army of fighting men of his
stock, were fifty-seven thousand four hundred.

<span id="an_2:9">2:9</span> All that were numbered in the camp of Juda,
were a hundred and eighty-six thousand four hundred: and they by their
troops shall march first.

<span id="an_2:10">2:10</span> In the camp of the sons of Ruben, on the
south side, the prince shall be Elisur the son of Sedeur:

<span id="an_2:11">2:11</span> And the whole army of his fighting men,
that were numbered, were forty-six thousand five hundred.

<span id="an_2:12">2:12</span> Beside him camped they of the tribe of
Simeon: whose prince was Salamiel the son of Surisaddai.

<span id="an_2:13">2:13</span> And the whole army of his fighting men,
that were numbered, were fifty-nine thousand three hundred.

<span id="an_2:14">2:14</span> In the tribe of Gad the prince was
Eliasaph the son of Duel.

<span id="an_2:15">2:15</span> And the whole army of his fighting men
that were numbered, were forty- five thousand six hundred and fifty.

<span id="an_2:16">2:16</span> All that were reckoned up in the camp of
Ruben, were a hundred and fifty-one thousand four hundred and fifty, by
their troops: they shall march in the second place.

<span id="an_2:17">2:17</span> And the tabernacle of the testimony shall
be carried by the officers of the Levites and their troops. As it shall
be set up, so shall it be taken down. Every one shall march according to
their places, and ranks.

<span id="an_2:18">2:18</span> On the west side shall be the camp of the
sons of Ephraim, whose prince was Elisama, the son of Ammiud.

<span id="an_2:19">2:19</span> The whole army of his fighting men, that
were numbered, were forty thousand five hundred.

<span id="an_2:20">2:20</span> And with them the tribe of the sons of
Manasses, whose prince was Gamaliel the son of Phadassur.

<span id="an_2:21">2:21</span> And the whole army of his fighting men,
that were numbered, were thirty-two thousand two hundred.

<span id="an_2:22">2:22</span> In the tribe of the sons of Benjamin the
prince was Abidan the son of Gedeon.

<span id="an_2:23">2:23</span> And the whole army of his fighting men,
that were reckoned up, were thirty-five thousand four hundred.

<span id="an_2:24">2:24</span> All that were numbered in the camp of
Ephraim, were a hundred and eight thousand one hundred by their troops:
they shall march in the third place.

<span id="an_2:25">2:25</span> On the north side camped the sons of Dan:
whose prince was Ahiezar the son of Ammisaddai.

<span id="an_2:26">2:26</span> The whole army of his fighting men, that
were numbered, were sixty-two thousand seven hundred.

<span id="an_2:27">2:27</span> Beside him they of the tribe of Aser
pitched their tents: whose prince was Phegiel the son of Ochran.

<span id="an_2:28">2:28</span> The whole army of his fighting men, that
were numbered, were forty-one thousand five hundred.

<span id="an_2:29">2:29</span> Of the tribe of the sons of Nephtali the
prince was Ahira the son of Enan.

<span id="an_2:30">2:30</span> The whole army of his fighting men, were
fifty-three thousand four hundred.

<span id="an_2:31">2:31</span> All that were numbered in the camp of
Dan, were a hundred and fifty-seven thousand six hundred: and they shall
march last.

<span id="an_2:32">2:32</span> This is the number of the children of
Israel, of their army divided according to the houses of their kindreds
and their troops, six hundred and three thousand five hundred and fifty.

<span id="an_2:33">2:33</span> And the Levites were not numbered among
the children of Israel: for so the Lord had commanded Moses.

<span id="an_2:34">2:34</span> And the children of Israel did according
to all things that the Lord had commanded. They camped by their troops,
and marched by the families and houses of their fathers.

<span id="an_3:1">3:1</span> These are the generations of Aaron and
Moses in the day that the Lord spoke to Moses in mount Sinai.

<span id="an_3:2">3:2</span> And these the names of the sons of Aaron:
his firstborn Nadab, then Abiu, and Eleazar, and Ithamar.

<span id="an_3:3">3:3</span> These the names of the sons of Aaron the
priests that were anointed, and whose hands were filled and consecrated,
to do the functions of priesthood.

<span id="an_3:4">3:4</span> Now Nadab and Abiu died, without children,
when they offered strange fire before the Lord, in the desert of Sinai:
and Eleazar and Ithamar performed the priestly office in the presence of
Aaron their father.

<span id="an_3:5">3:5</span> And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:

<span id="an_3:6">3:6</span> Bring the tribe of Levi, and make them
stand in the sight of Aaron the priest to minister to him, and let them
watch,

<span id="an_3:7">3:7</span> And observe whatsoever appertaineth to the
service of the multitude before the tabernacle of the testimony,

<span id="an_3:8">3:8</span> And let them keep the vessels of the
tabernacle, serving in the ministry thereof.

<span id="an_3:9">3:9</span> And thou shalt give the Levites for a gift,

<span id="an_3:10">3:10</span> To Aaron and to his sons, to whom they
are delivered by the children of Israel. But thou shalt appoint Aaron
and his sons over the service of priesthood. The stranger that
approacheth to minister, shall be put to death.

<span id="an_3:11">3:11</span> And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying :

<span id="an_3:12">3:12</span> I have taken the Levites from the
children of Israel, for every firstborn that openeth the womb among the
children of Israel, and the Levites shall be mine.

<span id="an_3:13">3:13</span> For every firstborn is mine: since I
struck the firstborn in the land of Egypt: I have sanctified to myself
whatsoever is firstborn in Israel both of man and beast, they are mine:
I am the Lord.

<span id="an_3:14">3:14</span> And the Lord spoke to Moses in the desert
of Sinai, saying:

<span id="an_3:15">3:15</span> Number the sons of Levi by the houses of
their fathers and their families, every male from one month and upward.

<span id="an_3:16">3:16</span> Moses numbered them as the Lord had
commanded.

<span id="an_3:17">3:17</span> And there were found sons of Levi by
their names, Gerson and Caath and Merari.

<span id="an_3:18">3:18</span> The sons of Gerson: Lebni and Semei.

<span id="an_3:19">3:19</span> The sons of Caath: Amram, and Jesaar,
Hebron and Oziel:

<span id="an_3:20">3:20</span> The sons of Merari: Moholi and Musi.

<span id="an_3:21">3:21</span> Of Gerson were two families, the
Lebnites, and the Semeites:

<span id="an_3:22">3:22</span> Of which were numbered, people of the
male sex from one month and upward, seven thousand five hundred.

<span id="an_3:23">3:23</span> These shall pitch behind the tabernacle
on the west,

<span id="an_3:24">3:24</span> Under their prince Eliasaph the son of
Lael.

<span id="an_3:25">3:25</span> And their charge shall be in the
tabernacle of the covenant:

<span id="an_3:26">3:26</span> The tabernacle itself and the cover
thereof, the hanging that is drawn before the doors of the tabernacle of
the covenant, and the curtains of the court: the hanging also that is
hanged in the entry of the court of the tabernacle, and whatsoever
belongeth to the rite of the altar, the cords of the tabernacle, and all
the furniture thereof.

<span id="an_3:27">3:27</span> Of the kindred of Caath come the families
of the Amramites and Jesaarites and Hebronites and Ozielites. These are
the families of the Caathites reckoned up by their names:

<span id="an_3:28">3:28</span> All of the male sex from one month and
upward, eight thousand six hundred: they shall have the guard of the
sanctuary,

<span id="an_3:29">3:29</span> And shall camp on the south side.

<span id="an_3:30">3:30</span> And their prince shall be Elisaphan the
son of Oziel:

<span id="an_3:31">3:31</span> And they shall keep the ark, and the
table and the candlestick, the altars, and the vessels of the sanctuary,
wherewith they minister, and the veil, and all the furniture of this
kind.

<span id="an_3:32">3:32</span> And the prince of the princes of the
Levites, Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, shall be over them that
watch for the guard of the sanctuary.

<span id="an_3:33">3:33</span> And of Merari are the families of the
Moholites, and Musites, reckoned up by their names :

<span id="an_3:34">3:34</span> All of the male kind from one month and
upward, six thousand two hundred.

<span id="an_3:35">3:35</span> Their prince Suriel the son of Abihaiel:
they shall camp on the north side.

<span id="an_3:36">3:36</span> Under their custody shall be the boards
of the tabernacle, and the bars, and the pillars and their sockets, and
all things that pertain to this kind of service:

<span id="an_3:37">3:37</span> And the pillars of the court round about
with their sockets, and the pins with their cords.

<span id="an_3:38">3:38</span> Before the tabernacle of the covenant,
that is to say on the east side, shall Moses and Aaron camp, with their
sons, having the custody of the sanctuary, in the midst of the children
of Israel. What stranger soever cometh unto it, shall be put to death.

<span id="an_3:39">3:39</span> All the Levites, that Moses and Aaron
numbered according to the precept of the Lord, by their families, of the
male kind from one month and upward, were twenty-two thousand.

<span id="an_3:40">3:40</span> And the Lord said to Moses: Number the
firstborn of the male sex of the children of Israel, from one month and
upward, and thou shalt take the sum of them.

<span id="an_3:41">3:41</span> And thou shalt take the Levites to me for
all the firstborn of the children of Israel, I am the Lord: and their
cattle for all the firstborn of the cattle of the children of Israel:

<span id="an_3:42">3:42</span> Moses reckoned up, as the Lord had
commanded, the firstborn of the children of Israel:

<span id="an_3:43">3:43</span> And the males by their names, from one
month and upward, were twenty-two thousand two hundred and
seventy-three.

<span id="an_3:44">3:44</span> And the Lord spoke to Moses, saving:

<span id="an_3:45">3:45</span> Take the Levites for the firstborn of the
children of Israel, and the cattle of the Levites for their cattle, and
the Levites shall be mine. I am the Lord.

<span id="an_3:46">3:46</span> But for the price of the two hundred and
seventy-three, of the firstborn of the children of Israel, that exceed
the number of the Levites,

<span id="an_3:47">3:47</span> Thou shalt take five sides for every
head, according to the weight of the sanctuary. A sicle hath twenty
obols.

<span id="an_3:48">3:48</span> And then shalt give the money to Aaron
and his sons, the price of them that are above.

<span id="an_3:49">3:49</span> Moses therefore took the money of them
that were above, and whom they had redeemed from the Levites,

<span id="an_3:50">3:50</span> For the firstborn of the children of
Israel, one thousand three hundred and sixty-five sicles, according to
the weight of the sanctuary,

<span id="an_3:51">3:51</span> And gave it to Aaron and his sons,
according to the word that the Lord had commanded him.

<span id="an_4:1">4:1</span> And the Lord spoke to Moses, and Aaron,
saying:

<span id="an_4:2">4:2</span> Take the sum of the sons of Caath from the
midst of the Levites, by their houses and families.

<span id="an_4:3">4:3</span> From thirty years old and upward, to fifty
years old, of all that go in to stand and to minister in the tabernacle
of the covenant.

<span id="an_4:4">4:4</span> This is the service of the sons of Caath:

<span id="an_4:5">4:5</span> When the camp is to set forward, Aaron and
his sons shall go into the tabernacle of the covenant, and the holy of
holies, and shall take down the veil that hangeth before the door, and
shall wrap up the ark of the testimony in it,

<span id="an_4:6">4:6</span> And shall cover it again with a cover of
violet skins, and shall spread over it a cloth all of violet, and shall
put in the bars.

<span id="an_4:7">4:7</span> They shall wrap up also the table of
proposition in a cloth of violet, and shall put with it the censers and
little mortars, the cups and bowls to pour out the libations: the leaves
shall be always on it:

<span id="an_4:8">4:8</span> And they shall spread over it a cloth of
scarlet, which again they shall cover with a covering of violet skins,
and shall put in the bars.

<span id="an_4:9">4:9</span> They shall take also a cloth of violet
wherewith they shall cover the candlestick with the lamps and tongs
thereof and the snuffers and all the oil vessels, which are necessary
for the dressing of the lamps :

<span id="an_4:10">4:10</span> And over all they shall put a cover of
violet skins and put in the bars.

<span id="an_4:11">4:11</span> And they shall wrap up the golden altar
also in a cloth of violet, and shall spread over it a cover of violet
skins, and put in the bars.

<span id="an_4:12">4:12</span> All the vessels wherewith they minister
in the sanctuary, they shall wrap up in a cloth of violet, and shall
spread over it a cover of violet skins, and put in the bars.

<span id="an_4:13">4:13</span> They shall cleanse the altar also from
the ashes, and shall wrap it up in a purple cloth,

<span id="an_4:14">4:14</span> And shall put it with all the vessels
that they use in the ministry thereof, that is to say, firepans,
fleshhooks and forks, pothooks and shovels. They shall cover all the
vessels of the altar together with a covering of violet skins, and shall
put in the bars.

<span id="an_4:15">4:15</span> And when Aaron and his sons have wrapped
up the sanctuary and the vessels thereof at the removing of the camp,
then shall the sons of Caath enter in to carry the things wrapped up:
and they shall not touch the vessels of the sanctuary, lest they die.
These are the burdens of the sons of Caath: in the tabernacle of the
covenant:

<span id="an_4:16">4:16</span> And over them shall be Eleazar the son of
Aaron the priest, to whose charge pertaineth the oil to dress the lamps,
and the sweet incense, and the sacrifice, that is always offered, and
the oil of unction, and whatsoever pertaineth to the service of the
tabernacle, and of all the vessels that are in the sanctuary.

<span id="an_4:17">4:17</span> And the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron,
saying:

<span id="an_4:18">4:18</span> Destroy not the people of Caath from the
midst of the Levites:

<span id="an_4:19">4:19</span> But do this to them, that they may live,
and not die, by touching the holies of holies. Aaron and his sons shall
go in, and they shall appoint every man his work, and shall divide the
burdens that every man is to carry.

<span id="an_4:20">4:20</span> Let not others by any curiosity see the
things that are in the sanctuary before they be wrapped up, otherwise
they shall die.

<span id="an_4:21">4:21</span> And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:

<span id="an_4:22">4:22</span> Take the sum of the soils of Gerson also
by their houses and families and kindreds.

<span id="an_4:23">4:23</span> From thirty Sears old and upward, unto
fifty years old. Number them all that go in and minister in the
tabernacle of the covenant.

<span id="an_4:24">4:24</span> This is the office of the family of the
Gersonites :

<span id="an_4:25">4:25</span> To carry the curtains of the tabernacle
and the roof of the covenant, the other covering, and the violet
covering over all, and the hanging that hangeth in the entry of the
tabernacle of the covenant,

<span id="an_4:26">4:26</span> The curtains of the court, and the veil
in the entry that is before the tabernacle. All things that pertain to
the altar, the cords and the vessels of the ministry,

<span id="an_4:27">4:27</span> The sons of Gerson shall carry, by the
commandment of Aaron and his sons: and each man shall know to what
burden he must be assigned.

<span id="an_4:28">4:28</span> This is the service of the family of the
Gersonites in the tabernacle of the covenant, and they shall be under
the hand of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest.

<span id="an_4:29">4:29</span> Thou shalt reckon up the sons of Merari
also by the families and houses of their fathers,

<span id="an_4:30">4:30</span> From thirty years old and upward, unto
fifty years old, all that go in to the office of their ministry, and to
the service of the covenant of the testimony.

<span id="an_4:31">4:31</span> These are their burdens: They shall carry
the boards of the tabernacle and the bars thereof, the pillars and their
sockets,

<span id="an_4:32">4:32</span> The pillars also of the court round
about, with their sockets and pins and cords. They shall receive by
account all the vessels and furniture, and so shall carry them.

<span id="an_4:33">4:33</span> This is the office of the family of the
Merarites, and their ministry in the tabernacle of the covenant: and
they shall be under the hand of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest.

<span id="an_4:34">4:34</span> So Moses and Aaron and the princes of the
synagogue reckoned up the sons of Caath, by their kindreds and the
houses of their fathers,

<span id="an_4:35">4:35</span> From thirty years old and upward, unto
fifty years old, all that go in to the ministry of the tabernacle of the
covenant:

<span id="an_4:36">4:36</span> And they were found two thousand seven
hundred and fifty.

<span id="an_4:37">4:37</span> This is the number of the people of Caath
that go in to the tabernacle of the covenant: these did Moses and Aaron
number according to the word of the Lord by the hand of Moses.

<span id="an_4:38">4:38</span> The sons of Gerson also were numbered by
the kindreds and houses of their fathers,

<span id="an_4:39">4:39</span> From thirty years old and upward, unto
fifty years old, all that go in to minister in the tabernacle of the
covenant:

<span id="an_4:40">4:40</span> And they were found two thousand six
hundred and thirty.

<span id="an_4:41">4:41</span> This is the people of the Gersonites,
whom Moses and Aaron numbered according to the word of the Lord.

<span id="an_4:42">4:42</span> The sons of Merari also were numbered by
the kindreds and houses of their fathers,

<span id="an_4:43">4:43</span> From thirty years old and upward, unto
fifty years old, all that go in to fulfil the rites of the tabernacle of
the covenant:

<span id="an_4:44">4:44</span> And they were found three thousand two
hundred.

<span id="an_4:45">4:45</span> This is the number of the sons of Merari,
whom Moses and Aaron reckoned up according to the commandment of the
Lord by the hand of Moses.

<span id="an_4:46">4:46</span> All that were reckoned up of the Levites,
and whom Moses and Aaron and the princes of Israel took by name, by the
kindreds and houses of their fathers,

<span id="an_4:47">4:47</span> From thirty years old and upward, until
fifty years old, that go into the ministry of the tabernacle, and to
carry the burdens,

<span id="an_4:48">4:48</span> Were in all eight thousand five hundred
and eighty.

<span id="an_4:49">4:49</span> Moses reckoned them up according to the
word of the Lord, every one according to their office and burdens, as
the Lord had commanded him.

<span id="an_5:1">5:1</span> And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:

<span id="an_5:2">5:2</span> Command the children of Israel, that they
cast out of the camp every leper, and whosoever hath an issue of seed,
or is defiled by the dead:

<span id="an_5:3">5:3</span> Whether it be man or woman, cast ye them
out of the camp, lest they defile it when I shall dwell with you.

<span id="an_5:4">5:4</span> And the children of Israel did so, and they
cast them forth without the camp, as the Lord had spoken to Moses.

<span id="an_5:5">5:5</span> And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:

<span id="an_5:6">5:6</span> Say to the children of Israel: When a man
or woman shall have committed any of all the sins that men are wont to
commit, and by negligence shall have transgressed the commandment of the
Lord, and offended,

<span id="an_5:7">5:7</span> They shall confess their sin, and restore
the principal itself, and the fifth part over and above, to him against
whom they have sinned.

<span id="an_5:8">5:8</span> But if there be no one to receive it, they
shall give it to the Lord, and it shall be the priest's, besides the ram
that is offered for expiation, to be an atoning sacrifice.

<span id="an_5:9">5:9</span> an the firstfruits also, which the children
of Israel offer, belong to the priest:

<span id="an_5:10">5:10</span> And whatsoever is offered into the
sanctuary by every one, and is delivered into the hands of the priest,
it shall be his.

<span id="an_5:11">5:11</span> And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:

<span id="an_5:12">5:12</span> Speak to the children of Israel, and thou
shalt say to them: The man whose wife shall have gone astray, and
contemning her husband,

<span id="an_5:13">5:13</span> Shall have slept with another man, and
her husband cannot discover it, but the adultery is secret, and cannot
be proved by witnesses, because she was not found in the adultery:

<span id="an_5:14">5:14</span> If the spirit of jealousy stir up the
husband against his wife, who either is defiled, or is charged with
false suspicion,

<span id="an_5:15">5:15</span> He shall bring her to the priest, and
shall offer an oblation for her, the tenth part of a measure of barley
meal: he shall not pour oil thereon, nor put frank- incense upon it:
because it is a sacrifice of jealousy, and an oblation searching out
adultery.

<span id="an_5:16">5:16</span> The priest therefore shall offer it, and
set it before the Lord.

<span id="an_5:17">5:17</span> And he shall take holy water in an
earthen vessel, and he shall cast a little earth of the pavement of the
tabernacle into it.

<span id="an_5:18">5:18</span> And when the woman shall stand before the
Lord, he shall uncover her head, and shall, put on her hands the
sacrifice of remembrance, and the oblation of jealousy: and he himself
shall hold the most bitter waters, whereon he hath heaped curses with
execration.

<span id="an_5:19">5:19</span> And he shall adjure her, and shall say:
If another man hath not slept with thee, and if thou be not defiled by
forsaking thy husband's bed, these most bitter waters, on which I have
heaped curses, shall not hurt thee.

<span id="an_5:20">5:20</span> But if thou hast gone aside from thy
husband, and art defiled, and hast lain with another man:

<span id="an_5:21">5:21</span> These curses shall light upon thee: The
Lord make thee a curse, and an example for all among his people: may he
make thy thigh to rot, and may thy belly swell and burst asunder.

<span id="an_5:22">5:22</span> Let the cursed waters enter into thy
belly, and may thy womb swell and thy thigh rot. And the woman shall
answer, Amen, amen.

<span id="an_5:23">5:23</span> And the priest shall write these curses
in a book, and shall wash them out with the most bitter waters, upon
which he hath heaped the curses,

<span id="an_5:24">5:24</span> And he shall give them her to drink. And
when she hath drunk them up,

<span id="an_5:25">5:25</span> The priest shall take from her hand the
sacrifice of jealousy, and shall elevate it before the Lord, and shall
put it upon the altar: yet so as first,

<span id="an_5:26">5:26</span> To take a handful of the sacrifice of
that which is offered, and burn it upon the altar: and so give the most
bitter waters to the woman to drink.

<span id="an_5:27">5:27</span> And when she hath drunk them, if she be
defiled, and having despised her husband be guilty of adultery, the
malediction shall go through her, and her belly swelling, her thigh
shall rot: and the woman shall be a curse, and an example to all the
people.

<span id="an_5:28">5:28</span> But if she be not defiled, she shall not
be hurt, and shall bear children.

<span id="an_5:29">5:29</span> This is the law of jealousy. If a woman
hath gone aside from her husband, and be defiled,

<span id="an_5:30">5:30</span> And the husband stirred up by the spirit
of jealousy bring her before the Lord, and the priest do to her
according to all things that are here written:

<span id="an_5:31">5:31</span> The husband shall be blameless, and she
shall bear her iniquity.

<span id="an_6:1">6:1</span> And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:

<span id="an_6:2">6:2</span> Speak to the children of Israel, and thou
shalt say to them: When a man, or woman, shall make a vow to be
sanctified, and will consecrate themselves to the Lord:

<span id="an_6:3">6:3</span> They shall abstain from wine, and from
every thing that may make a man drunk. They shall not drink vinegar of
wine, or of any other drink, nor any thing that is pressed out of the
grape: nor shall they eat grapes either fresh or dried.

<span id="an_6:4">6:4</span> All the days that they are consecrated to
the Lord by vow: they shall eat nothing that cometh of the vineyard,
from the raisin even to the kernel.

<span id="an_6:5">6:5</span> All the time of his separation no razor
shall pass over his head, until the day be fulfilled of his consecration
to the Lord. He shall be holy, and shall let the hair of his head grow.

<span id="an_6:6">6:6</span> All the time of his consecration he shall
not go in to any dead,

<span id="an_6:7">6:7</span> Neither shall he make himself unclean, even
for his father, or for his mother, or for his brother, or for his
sister, when they die, because the consecration of his God is upon his
head.

<span id="an_6:8">6:8</span> All the days of his separation he shall be
holy to the Lord.

<span id="an_6:9">6:9</span> But if any man die suddenly before him: the
head of his consecration shall be defiled: and he shall shave it
forthwith on the same day of his purification, and again on the seventh
day.

<span id="an_6:10">6:10</span> And on the eighth day he shall bring two
turtles, or two young pigeons to the priest in the entry of the covenant
of the testimony.

<span id="an_6:11">6:11</span> And the priest shall offer one for sin,
and the other for a holocaust, and shall pray for him, for that he hath
sinned by the dead: and he shall sanctify his head that day :

<span id="an_6:12">6:12</span> And shall consecrate to the Lord the days
of his separation, offering a lamb of one year for sin: yet so that the
former days be made void, because his sanctification was profaned.

<span id="an_6:13">6:13</span> This is the law of consecration. When the
days which he had determined by vow shall be expired, he shall bring him
to the door of the tabernacle of the covenant,

<span id="an_6:14">6:14</span> And shall offer his oblation to the Lord:
one he lamb of a year old without blemish for a holocaust, and one awe
lamb of a year old without blemish for a sin offering, and one ram
without blemish for a victim of peace offering,

<span id="an_6:15">6:15</span> A basket also of unleavened bread,
tempered with oil, and wafers without leaven anointed with oil, and the
libations of each:

<span id="an_6:16">6:16</span> And the priest shall present them before
the Lord, and shall offer both the sin offering and the holocaust.

<span id="an_6:17">6:17</span> But the ram he shall immolate for a
sacrifice of peace offering to the Lord, offering at the same time the
basket of unleavened bread, and the libations that are due by custom.

<span id="an_6:18">6:18</span> Then shall the hair of the consecration
of the Nazarite, be shaved off before the door of the tabernacle of the
covenant: and he shall take his hair, and lay it upon the fire, which is
under the sacrifice of the peace offerings.

<span id="an_6:19">6:19</span> And shall take the boiled shoulder of the
ram, and one unleavened cake out of the basket, and one unleavened
wafer, and he shall deliver them into the hands of the Nazarite, after
his head is shaven.

<span id="an_6:20">6:20</span> And receiving them again from him, he
shall elevate them in the sight of the Lord: and they being sanctified
shall belong to the priest, as the breast, which was commanded to be
separated, and the shoulder. After this the Nazarite may drink wine.

<span id="an_6:21">6:21</span> This is the law of the Nazarite, when he
hath vowed his oblation to the Lord in the time of his consecration,
besides those things which his hand shall find, according to that which
he had vowed in his mind, so shall he do for the fulfilling of his
sanctification.

<span id="an_6:22">6:22</span> And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:

<span id="an_6:23">6:23</span> Say to Aaron and his sons: Thus shall you
bless the children of Israel, and you shall say to them:

<span id="an_6:24">6:24</span> The Lord bless thee, and keep thee.

<span id="an_6:25">6:25</span> The Lord shew his face to thee, and have
mercy on thee.

<span id="an_6:26">6:26</span> The Lord turn his countenance to thee,
and give thee peace.

<span id="an_6:27">6:27</span> And they shall invoke my name upon the
children of Israel, and I will bless them.

<span id="an_7:1">7:1</span> And it came to pass in the day that Moses
had finished the tabernacle, and set it up, and had anointed and
sanctified it with all its vessels, the altar likewise and all the
vessels thereof,

<span id="an_7:2">7:2</span> The princes of Israel and the heads of the
families, in every tribe, who were the rulers of them who had been
numbered, offered

<span id="an_7:3">7:3</span> Their gifts before the Lord, six wagons
covered, and twelve oxen. Two princes offered one wagon, and each one an
ox, and they offered them before the tabernacle.

<span id="an_7:4">7:4</span> And the Lord said to Moses:

<span id="an_7:5">7:5</span> Receive them from them to serve in the
ministry of the tabernacle, and thou shalt deliver them to the Levites
according to the order of their ministry.

<span id="an_7:6">7:6</span> Moses therefore receiving the wagons and
the oxen, delivered them to the Levites.

<span id="an_7:7">7:7</span> Two wagons and four oxen he gave to the
sons of Gerson, according to their necessity.

<span id="an_7:8">7:8</span> The other four wagons, and eight oxen he
gave to the sons of Merari, according to their offices and service,
under the hand of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest.

<span id="an_7:9">7:9</span> But to the sons of Caath he gave no wagons
or oxen: because they serve in the sanctuary and carry their burdens
upon their own shoulders.

<span id="an_7:10">7:10</span> And the princes offered for the
dedication of the altar on the day when it was anointed, their oblation
before the altar.

<span id="an_7:11">7:11</span> And the Lord said to Moses: Let each of
the princes one day after another offer their gifts for the dedication
of the altar.

Aminadab of the tribe of Juda offered his offering:

<span id="an_7:83">7:83</span> And for sacrifices of peace offerings,
two oxen, five rams, five buck goats, five lambs of a year old. This was
the offering of Ahira the son of Enan.

<span id="an_7:84">7:84</span> These were the offerings made by the
princes of Israel in the dedication of the altar, in the day wherein it
was consecrated. Twelve dishes of silver: twelve silver bowls: twelve
little mortars of gold:

<span id="an_7:85">7:85</span> Each dish weighing a hundred and thirty
sides of silver, and each bowl seventy sides: that is, putting all the
vessels of silver together, two thousand four hundred sides, by the
weight of the sanctuary.

<span id="an_7:86">7:86</span> Twelve little mortars of gold full of
incense, weighing ten sides apiece, by the weight of the sanctuary: that
is, in all a hundred and twenty sides of gold.

<span id="an_7:87">7:87</span> Twelve oxen out of the herd for a
holocaust, twelve rams, twelve lambs of a year old, and their libations:
twelve buck goats for sin.

<span id="an_7:88">7:88</span> And for sacrifices of peace offerings,
oxen twenty-four, rams sixty, buck goats sixty, lambs of a year old
sixty. These things were offered in the dedication of the altar, when it
was anointed.

<span id="an_7:89">7:89</span> And when Moses entered into the
tabernacle of the covenant, to consult the oracle, he heard the voice of
one speaking to him from the propitiatory, that was over the ark between
the two cherubims, and from this place he spoke to him.

<span id="an_8:1">8:1</span> And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:

<span id="an_8:2">8:2</span> Speak to Aaron, and thou shalt say to him:
When thou shalt place the seven lamps, let the candlestick be set up on
the south side. Give orders therefore that the lamps look over against
the north, towards the table of the leaves of proposition, over against
that part shall they give light, towards which the candlestick looketh.

<span id="an_8:3">8:3</span> And Aaron did so, and he put the lamps upon
the candlestick, as the Lord had commanded Moses.

<span id="an_8:4">8:4</span> Now this was the work of the candlestick,
it was of beaten gold, both the shaft in the middle, and all that came
out of both sides of the branches: according to the pattern which the
Lord had shewn to Moses, so he made the candlestick.

<span id="an_8:5">8:5</span> And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying :

<span id="an_8:6">8:6</span> Take the Levites out of the midst of the
children of Israel, and thou shalt purify them,

<span id="an_8:7">8:7</span> According to this rite: Let them be
sprinkled with the water of purification, and let them shave all the
hairs of their flesh. And when they shall have washed their garments,
and are cleansed,

<span id="an_8:8">8:8</span> They shall take an ox of the herd, and for
the offering thereof fine flour tempered with oil: and thou shalt take
another ox of the herd for a sin offering:

<span id="an_8:9">8:9</span> And thou shalt bring the Levites before the
tabernacle of the covenant, calling together all the multitude of the
children of Israel:

<span id="an_8:10">8:10</span> And when the Levites are before the Lord,
the children of Israel shall put their hands upon them:

<span id="an_8:11">8:11</span> And Aaron shall offer the Levites, as a
gift in the sight of the Lord from the children of Israel, that they may
serve in his ministry.

<span id="an_8:12">8:12</span> The Levites also shall put their hands
upon the heads of the oxen, of which thou shalt sacrifice one for sin,
and the other for a holocaust to the Lord, to pray for them.

<span id="an_8:13">8:13</span> And thou shalt set the Levites in the
sight of Aaron and of his sons, and shalt consecrate them being offered
to the Lord,

<span id="an_8:14">8:14</span> And shalt separate them from the midst of
the children of Israel, to be mine.

<span id="an_8:15">8:15</span> And afterwards they shall enter into the
tabernacle of the covenant, to serve me. And thus shalt thou purify and
consecrate them for an oblation of the Lord: for as a gift they were
given me by the children of Israel.

<span id="an_8:16">8:16</span> I have taken them instead of the
firstborn that open every womb in Israel,

<span id="an_8:17">8:17</span> For all the firstborn of the children of
Israel, both of men and of beasts, are mine. From the day that I slew
every firstborn in the land of Egypt, have I sanctified them to myself:

<span id="an_8:18">8:18</span> And I have taken the Levites for all the
firstborn of the children of Israel:

<span id="an_8:19">8:19</span> And have delivered them for a gift to
Aaron and his sons out of the midst of the people, to serve me for
Israel in the tabernacle of the covenant, and to pray for them, lest
there should be a plague among the people, if they should presume to
approach unto my sanctuary.

<span id="an_8:20">8:20</span> And Moses and Aaron and all the multitude
of the children of Israel did with the Levites all that the Lord had
commanded Moses:

<span id="an_8:21">8:21</span> And they were purified, and washed their
garments. And Aaron lifted them up in the sight of the Lard, and prayed
for them,

<span id="an_8:22">8:22</span> That being purified they might go into
the tabernacle of the covenant to do their services before Aaron and his
sons. As the Lord had commanded Moses touching the Levites, so was it
done.

<span id="an_8:23">8:23</span> And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:

<span id="an_8:24">8:24</span> This is the law of the Levites: From
twenty-five years old and upwards, they shall go in to minister in the
tabernacle of the covenant.

<span id="an_8:25">8:25</span> And when they shall have accomplished the
fiftieth year of their age, they shall cease to serve:

<span id="an_8:26">8:26</span> And they shall be the ministers of their
brethren in the tabernacle of the covenant, to keep the things that are
committed to their care, but not to do the works. Thus shalt thou order
the Levites touching their charge.

<span id="an_9:1">9:1</span> The Lord spoke to Moses in the desert of
Sinai, the second year after they were come out of the land of Egypt, in
the first month, saying:

<span id="an_9:2">9:2</span> Let the children of Israel make the phase
in its due time,

<span id="an_9:3">9:3</span> The fourteenth day of this month in the
evening, according to all the ceremonies and justifications thereof.

<span id="an_9:4">9:4</span> And Moses commanded the children of Israel
that they should make the phase.

<span id="an_9:5">9:5</span> And they made it in its proper time: the
fourteenth day of the month at evening, in mount Sinai. The children of
Israel did according to all things that the Lord had commanded Moses.

<span id="an_9:6">9:6</span> But behold some who were unclean by
occasion of the soul of a men, who could not make the phase on that day,
coming to Moses and Aaron,

<span id="an_9:7">9:7</span> Said to them: We are unclean by occasion of
the soul of a man. Why are we kept back that we may not offer in its
season the offering to the Lord among the children of Israel?

<span id="an_9:8">9:8</span> And Moses answered them: Stay that I may
consult the Lord what he will ordain concerning you.

<span id="an_9:9">9:9</span> And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:

<span id="an_9:10">9:10</span> Say to the children of Israel: The man
that shall be unclean by occasion of one that is dead, or shall be in a
journey afar off in your nation, let him make the phase to the Lord.

<span id="an_9:11">9:11</span> In the second month, on the fourteenth
day of the month in the evening, they shall eat it with unleavened bread
and wild lettuce:

<span id="an_9:12">9:12</span> They shall not leave any thing thereof
until morning, nor break a bone thereof, they shall observe all the
ceremonies of the phase.

<span id="an_9:13">9:13</span> But if any man is clean, and was not on a
journey, and did not make the phase, that soul shall be cut off from
among his people, because he offered not sacrifice to the Lord in due
season: he shall bear his sin.

<span id="an_9:14">9:14</span> The sojourner also and the stranger if
they be among you, shall make the phase to the Lord according to the
ceremonies and justifications thereof. The same ordinance shall be with
you both for the stranger, and for him that was born in the land.

<span id="an_9:15">9:15</span> Now on the day that the tabernacle was
reared up, a cloud covered it. But from the evening there was over the
tabernacle, as it were, the appearance of fire until the morning.

<span id="an_9:16">9:16</span> So it was always: by day the cloud
covered it, and by night as it were the appearance of fire.

<span id="an_9:17">9:17</span> And when the cloud that covered the
tabernacle was taken up, then the children of Israel marched forward:
and in the place where the cloud stood still, there they camped.

<span id="an_9:18">9:18</span> At the commandment of the Lord they
marched, and at his commandment they pitched the tabernacle. All the
days that the cloud abode over the tabernacle, they remained in the same
place:

<span id="an_9:19">9:19</span> And if it was so that it continued over
it a long time, the children of Israel kept the watches of the Lord, and
marched not,

<span id="an_9:20">9:20</span> For as many days soever as the cloud
stayed over the tabernacle. At the commandment of the Lord they pitched
their tents, and at his commandment they took them down.

<span id="an_9:21">9:21</span> If the cloud tarried from evening until
morning, and immediately at break of day left the tabernacle, they
marched forward: and if it departed after a day and a night, they took
down their tents.

<span id="an_9:22">9:22</span> But if it remained over the tabernacle
for two days or a month or a longer time, the children of Israel
remained in the same place, and marched not: but immediately as soon as
it departed, they removed the camp.

<span id="an_9:23">9:23</span> By the word of the Lord they pitched
their tents, and by his word they marched: and kept the watches of the
Lord according to his commandment by the hand of Moses.

<span id="an_10:1">10:1</span> And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:

<span id="an_10:2">10:2</span> Make thee two trumpets of beaten silver,
wherewith thou mayest call together the multitude when the camp is to be
removed.

<span id="an_10:3">10:3</span> And when thou shalt sound the trumpets,
all the multitude shall gather unto thee to the door of the tabernacle
of the covenant.

<span id="an_10:4">10:4</span> If thou sound but once, the princes and
the heads of the multitude of Israel shall come to thee.

<span id="an_10:5">10:5</span> But if the sound of the trumpets be
longer, and with interruptions, they that are on the east side, shall
first go forward.

<span id="an_10:6">10:6</span> And at the second sounding and like noise
of the trumpet, they who lie on the south side shall take up their
tents. And after this manner shall the rest do, when the trumpets shall
sound for a march.

<span id="an_10:7">10:7</span> But when the people is to be gathered
together, the sound of the trumpets shall be plain, and they shall not
make a broken sound.

<span id="an_10:8">10:8</span> And the sons of Aaron the priest shall
sound the trumpets: and this shall be an ordinance for ever in your
generations.

<span id="an_10:9">10:9</span> If you go forth to war out of your land
against the enemies that fight against you, you shall sound aloud with
the trumpets, and there shall be a remembrance of you before the Lord
your God, that you may be delivered out of the hands of your enemies.

<span id="an_10:10">10:10</span> If at any time you shall have a
banquet, end on your festival days, and on the first days of your
months, you shall sound the trumpets over the holocausts, and the
sacrifices of peace offerings, that they may be to you for a remembrance
of your God. I am the Lord your God.

<span id="an_10:11">10:11</span> The second year, in the second month,
the twentieth day of the month, the cloud was taken up from the
tabernacle of the covenant.

<span id="an_10:12">10:12</span> And the children of Israel marched by
their troops from the desert of Sinai, and the cloud rested in the
wilderness of Pharan.

<span id="an_10:13">10:13</span> And the first went forward according to
the commandment of the Lord by the hand of Moses.

<span id="an_10:14">10:14</span> The sons of Juda by their troops: whose
prince was Nahasson the son of Aminadab.

<span id="an_10:15">10:15</span> In the tribe of the sons of Issachar,
the prince was Nathanael the son of Suar.

<span id="an_10:16">10:16</span> In the tribe of Zabulon, the prince was
Eliab the son of Helon.

<span id="an_10:17">10:17</span> And the tabernacle was taken down, and
the sons of Gerson and Merari set forward, bearing it.

<span id="an_10:18">10:18</span> And the sons of Ruben also marched, by
their troops and ranks, whose prince was Helisur the son of Sedeur.

<span id="an_10:19">10:19</span> And in the tribe of Simeon, the prince
was Salamiel the son of Surisaddai.

<span id="an_10:20">10:20</span> And in the tribe of Cad, the prince was
Eliasaph the son of Duel.

<span id="an_10:21">10:21</span> Then the Caathites also marched
carrying the sanctuary. So long was the tabernacle carried, till they
same to the place of setting it up.

<span id="an_10:22">10:22</span> The sons of Ephraim also moved their
camp by their troops, in whose army the prince was Elisama the son of
Ammiud.

<span id="an_10:23">10:23</span> And in the tribe of the sons of
Manasses, the prince was Gamaliel the son of Phadassur.

<span id="an_10:24">10:24</span> And in the tribe of Benjamin, the
prince was Abidan the son of Gedeon.

<span id="an_10:25">10:25</span> The last of all the camp marched the
sons of Dan by their troops, in whose army the prince was Ahiezer the
son of Ammisaddai.

<span id="an_10:26">10:26</span> And in the tribe of the sons of Aser,
the prince was Phegiel the son of Ochran.

<span id="an_10:27">10:27</span> And in the tribe of the sons of
Nephtali, the prince was Ahira the son of Enan.

<span id="an_10:28">10:28</span> This was the order of the camps, and
marches of the children of Israel by their troops, when they set
forward.

<span id="an_10:29">10:29</span> And Moses said to Hobab the son of
Raguel the Madianite, his kinsman: We are going towards the place which
the Lord will give us: come with us, that we may do thee good : for the
Lord hath promised good things to Israel.

<span id="an_10:30">10:30</span> But he answered him: I will not go with
thee, but I will return to my country, wherein I was born.

<span id="an_10:31">10:31</span> And he said: Do not leave us: for thou
knowest in what places we should encamp in the wilderness, and thou
shalt be our guide.

<span id="an_10:32">10:32</span> And if thou comest with us, we will
give thee what is the best of the riches which the Lord shall deliver to
us.

<span id="an_10:33">10:33</span> So they marched from the mount of the
Lord three days' journey, and the ark of the covenant of the Lord went
before them, for three days providing a place for the camp.

<span id="an_10:34">10:34</span> The cloud also of the Lord was over
them by day when they marched.

<span id="an_10:35">10:35</span> And when the ark was lifted up, Moses
said: Arise, O Lord, and let thy enemies be scattered, and let them that
hate thee, flee from before thy face.

<span id="an_10:36">10:36</span> And when it was set down, he said:
Return, O Lord, to the multitude of the host of Israel.

<span id="an_11:1">11:1</span> In the mean time there arose a murmuring
of the people against the Lord, as it were repining at their fatigue.
And when the Lord heard it he was angry. And the fire of the Lord being
kindled against them, devoured them that were at the uttermost part of
the camp.

<span id="an_11:2">11:2</span> And when the people cried to Moses, Moses
prayed to the Lord, and the fire was swallowed up.

<span id="an_11:3">11:3</span> And he called the name of that place, The
burning: for that the fire of the Lord had been kindled against them.

<span id="an_11:4">11:4</span> For a mixt multitude of people, that came
up with them, burned with desire, sitting and weeping, the children of
Israel also being joined with them, and said: Who shall give us flesh to
eat?

<span id="an_11:5">11:5</span> We remember the Ash that we ate in Egypt
free cost: the cucumbers come into our mind, and the melons, and the
leeks, and the onions, and the garlic.

<span id="an_11:6">11:6</span> Our soul is dry, our eyes behold nothing
else but manna.

<span id="an_11:7">11:7</span> A Now the manna was like coriander seed,
of the colour of bdellium.

<span id="an_11:8">11:8</span> And the people went about, and gathering
it, ground it in a mill, or beat it in a mortar, and boiled it in a pot,
and made cakes thereof of the taste of bread tempered with oil.

<span id="an_11:9">11:9</span> and when the dew fell in the night upon
the camp, the manna also fell with it.

<span id="an_11:10">11:10</span> Now Moses heard the people weeping by
their families, every one at the door of his tent. And the wrath of the
Lord was exceedingly enkindled: to Moses also the thing seemed
insupportable.

<span id="an_11:11">11:11</span> And he said to the Lord: Why hast thou
afflicted thy servant? wherefore do I not find favour before thee? and
why hast thou laid the weight of all this people upon me ?

<span id="an_11:12">11:12</span> Have I conceived all this multitude, or
begotten them, that thou shouldst say to me: Carry them in thy bosom as
the nurse is wont to carry the little infant, and bear them into the
land, for which thou hast sworn to their fathers?

<span id="an_11:13">11:13</span> Whence should I have flesh to give to
so great a multitude? they weep against me, saying: Give us flesh that
we may eat.

<span id="an_11:14">11:14</span> I am not able alone to bear all this
people, because it is too heavy for me.

<span id="an_11:15">11:15</span> But if it seem unto thee otherwise, I
beseech thee to kill me, and let me find grace in thy eyes, that I be
not afflicted with so great evils.

<span id="an_11:16">11:16</span> And the Lord said to Moses: Gather unto
me seventy men of the ancients of Israel, whom thou knowest to be
ancients and masters of the people: and thou shalt bring them to the
door of the tabernacle of the covenant, and shalt make them stand there
with thee,

<span id="an_11:17">11:17</span> That I may come down and speak with
thee: and I will take of thy spirit, and will give to them, that they
may bear with thee the burden of the people, and thou mayest not be
burthened alone.

<span id="an_11:18">11:18</span> And thou shalt say to the people: Be ye
sanctified : to morrow you shall eat flesh: for I have heard you say:
Who will give us flesh to eat? it was well with us in Egypt. That the
Lord may give you flesh, and you may eat:

<span id="an_11:19">11:19</span> Not for one day, nor two, nor five, nor
ten, no nor for twenty.

<span id="an_11:20">11:20</span> But even for a month of days, till it
come out at your nostrils, and become loathsome to you, because you have
cast off the Lord, who is in the midst of you, and have wept before him,
saying: Why came we out of Egypt?

<span id="an_11:21">11:21</span> And Moses said: There are six hundred
thousand footmen of this people, and sayest thou: I will give them flesh
to eat a whole month?

<span id="an_11:22">11:22</span> Shall then a multitude of sheep and
oxen be killed, that it may suffice for their food? or shall the fishes
of the sea be gathered together to fill them?

<span id="an_11:23">11:23</span> And the Lord answered him: Is the hand
of the Lord unable? Thou shalt presently see whether my word shall come
to pass or no.

<span id="an_11:24">11:24</span> Moses therefore came, and told the
people the words of the Lord, and assembled seventy men of the ancients
of Israel, and made them to stand about the tabernacle.

<span id="an_11:25">11:25</span> And the Lord came down in a cloud, and
spoke to him, taking away of the spirit that was in Moses, and giving to
the seventy men. And when the spirit had rested on them they prophesied,
nor did they cease afterwards.

<span id="an_11:26">11:26</span> Now there remained in the camp two of
the men, of whom one was called Eldad, and the other Medad, upon whom
the spirit rested; for they also had been enrolled, but were not gone
forth to the tabernacle.

<span id="an_11:27">11:27</span> And when they prophesied in the camp,
there ran a young man, and told Moses, saying: Eldad and Medad prophesy
in the camp.

<span id="an_11:28">11:28</span> Forthwith Josue the son of Nun, the
minister of Moses, and chosen out of many, said: My lord Moses forbid
them.

<span id="an_11:29">11:29</span> But he said: Why hast thou emulation
for me? O that all the people might prophesy, and that the Lord would
give them his spirit!

<span id="an_11:30">11:30</span> And Moses returned, with the ancients
of Israel, into the camp.

<span id="an_11:31">11:31</span> And a wind going out from the Lord,
taking quails up beyond the sea brought them, and cast them into the
camp for the space of one day's journey, on every side of the camp round
about, and they flew in the air two cubits high above the ground.

<span id="an_11:32">11:32</span> The people therefore rising up all that
day, and night, and the next day, gathered together of quails, he that
did least, ten cores: and they dried them round about the camp.

<span id="an_11:33">11:33</span> As yet the flesh was between their
teeth, neither had that kind of meat failed: when behold the wrath of
the Lord being provoked against the people, struck them with an
exceeding great plague.

<span id="an_11:34">11:34</span> And that place was called, The graves
of lust: for there they buried the people that had lusted. And departing
from the graves of lust, they came unto Haseroth, and abode there.

<span id="an_12:1">12:1</span> And Mary and Aaron spoke against Moses,
because of his wife the Ethiopian,

<span id="an_12:2">12:2</span> And they said: Hath the Lord spoken by
Moses only? hath he not also spoken to us in like manner? And when the
Lord heard this,

<span id="an_12:3">12:3</span> (For Moses was a man exceeding meek above
all men that dwelt upon earth)

<span id="an_12:4">12:4</span> Immediately he spoke to him, and to Aaron
and Mary: Come out you three only to the tabernacle of the covenant. And
when they were come out,

<span id="an_12:5">12:5</span> The Lord came down in a pillar of the
cloud, and stood in the entry of the tabernacle calling to Aaron and
Mary. And when they were come,

<span id="an_12:6">12:6</span> He said to them: Hear my words: if there
be among you a prophet of the Lord, I will appear to him in a vision, or
I will speak to him in a dream.

<span id="an_12:7">12:7</span> But it is not so with my servant Moses
who is most faithful in all my house:

<span id="an_12:8">12:8</span> For I speak to him mouth to mouth: and
plainly, and not by riddles and figures doth he see the Lord. Why then
were you not afraid to speak ill of my servant Moses?

<span id="an_12:9">12:9</span> And being angry with them he went away:

<span id="an_12:10">12:10</span> The cloud also that was over the
tabernacle departed: and behold Mary appeared white as snow with a
leprosy. And when Aaron had looked on her, and saw her all covered with
leprosy,

<span id="an_12:11">12:11</span> He said to Moses: I beseech thee, my
lord, lay not upon us this sin, which we have foolishly committed:

<span id="an_12:12">12:12</span> Let her not be as one dead, and as an
abortive that is cast forth from the mother's womb. Lo, now one half of
her flesh is consumed with the leprosy.

<span id="an_12:13">12:13</span> And Moses cried to the Lord, saying: O
God, I beseech thee heal her.

<span id="an_12:14">12:14</span> And the Lord answered him: If her
father had spitten upon her face, ought she not to have been ashamed for
seven days at least? Let her be separated seven days without the camp,
and after wards she shall be called again.

<span id="an_12:15">12:15</span> Mary therefore was put out of the camp
seven days : and the people moved not from that place until Mary was
called again.

<span id="an_13:1">13:1</span> And the people marched from Haseroth, and
pitched their tents in the desert of Pharan.

<span id="an_13:2">13:2</span> And there the Lord spoke to Moses,
saying:

<span id="an_13:3">13:3</span> Send men to view the land of Chanaan,
which I will give to the children of Israel, one of every tribe, of the
rulers.

<span id="an_13:4">13:4</span> Moses did what the Lord had commanded,
sending from the desert of Pharan, principal men, whose names are these:

<span id="an_13:5">13:5</span> Of the tribe of Ruben, Sammua the son of
Zechur.

<span id="an_13:6">13:6</span> Of the tribe of Simeon, Saphat the son of
Hurl.

<span id="an_13:7">13:7</span> Of the tribe of Juda, Caleb the son of
Jephone.

<span id="an_13:8">13:8</span> Of the tribe of Issachar, Igal the son of
Joseph.

<span id="an_13:9">13:9</span> Of the tribe of Ephraim, Osee the son of
Nun.

<span id="an_13:10">13:10</span> Of the tribe of Benjamin, Phalti the
son of Raphu.

<span id="an_13:11">13:11</span> Of the tribe of Zabulon, Geddiel the
son of Sodi.

<span id="an_13:12">13:12</span> Of the tribe of Joseph, of the sceptre
of Manasses, Gaddi the son of Susi.

<span id="an_13:13">13:13</span> Of the tribe of Dan, Ammiel the son of
Gemalli.

<span id="an_13:14">13:14</span> Of the tribe of Aser, Sthur the son of
Michael.

<span id="an_13:15">13:15</span> Of the tribe of Nephtali, Nahabi the
son of Vapsi.

<span id="an_13:16">13:16</span> Of the tribe of Gad, Guel the son of
Machi.

<span id="an_13:17">13:17</span> These are the names of the men, whom
Moses sent to view the land: and he called Osee the son of Nun, Josue.

<span id="an_13:18">13:18</span> And Moses sent them to view the land of
Chanaan, and said to them: Go you up by the south side. And when you
shall come to the mountains,

<span id="an_13:19">13:19</span> View the land, of what sort it is: and
the people that are the inhabitants thereof, whether they be strong or
weak: few in number or many:

<span id="an_13:20">13:20</span> The land itself, whether it be good or
bad: what manner of cities, walled or without walls:

<span id="an_13:21">13:21</span> The ground, fat or barren, woody or
without trees. Be of good courage, and bring us of the fruits of the
land. Now it was the time when the first ripe grapes are fit to be
eaten.

<span id="an_13:22">13:22</span> And when they were gone up, they viewed
the land from the desert of Sin, unto Rohob as you enter into Emath.

<span id="an_13:23">13:23</span> And they went up at the south side, and
came to Hebron, where were Achiman and Sisai and Tholmai the sons of
Enac. For Hebron was built seven years before Tanis the city of Egypt.

<span id="an_13:24">13:24</span> And going forward as far as the torrent
of the cluster of grapes, they cut off a branch with its cluster of
grapes, which two men carried upon a lever. They took also of the
pomegranates and of the figs of that place:

<span id="an_13:25">13:25</span> Which was called Nehelescol, that is to
say, the torrent of the cluster of grapes, because from thence the
children of Israel had carried a cluster of grapes.

<span id="an_13:26">13:26</span> And they that went to spy out the land
returned after forty days, having gone round all the country,

<span id="an_13:27">13:27</span> And came to Moses and Aaron and to all
the assembly of the children of Israel to the desert of Pharan, which is
in Cades. And speaking to them and to all the multitude, they shewed
them the fruits of the land:

<span id="an_13:28">13:28</span> And they related and said: We came into
the land to which thou sentest us, which in very deed floweth with milk
and honey as may be known by these fruits:

<span id="an_13:29">13:29</span> But it hath very strong inhabitants,
and the cities are great and walled. We saw there the race of Enac.

<span id="an_13:30">13:30</span> Amalec dwelleth in the south, the
Hethite and the Jebusite and the Amorrhite in the mountains: but the
Chanaanite abideth by the sea and near the streams of the Jordan.

<span id="an_13:31">13:31</span> In the mean time Caleb, to still the
murmuring of the people that rose against Moses, said: Let us go up and
possess the land, for we shall be able to conquer it.

<span id="an_13:32">13:32</span> But the others, that had been with him,
said: No, we are not able to go up to this people, because they are
stronger than we.

<span id="an_13:33">13:33</span> And they spoke ill of the land, which
they had viewed, before the children of Israel, saying: The land which
we have viewed, devoureth its inhabitants: the people, that we beheld,
are of a tall stature.

<span id="an_13:34">13:34</span> There we saw certain monsters of the
sons of Enac, of the giant kind: in comparison of whom, we seemed like
locusts.

<span id="an_14:1">14:1</span> Therefore the whole multitude crying wept
that night.

<span id="an_14:2">14:2</span> And all the children of Israel murmured
against Moses and Aaron, saying:

<span id="an_14:3">14:3</span> Would God that we had died in Egypt and
would God we may die in this vast wilderness, and that the Lord may not
bring us into this land, lest we fall by the sword, and our wives and
children be led away captives. Is it not better to return into Egypt?

<span id="an_14:4">14:4</span> And they said one to another: Let us
appoint a captain, and let us return into Egypt.

<span id="an_14:5">14:5</span> And when Moses and Aaron heard this, they
fell down flat upon the ground before the multitude of the children of
Israel.

<span id="an_14:6">14:6</span> But Josue the son of Nun, and Caleb the
son of Jephone, who themselves also had viewed the land, rent their
garments,

<span id="an_14:7">14:7</span> And said to all the multitude of the
children of Israel: The land which we have gone round is very good:

<span id="an_14:8">14:8</span> If the Lord be favourable, he will bring
us into it, and give us a land flowing with milk and honey.

<span id="an_14:9">14:9</span> Be not rebellious against the Lord: and
fear ye not the people of this land, for we are able to eat them up as
bread. All aid is gone from them: the Lord is with us, fear ye not.

<span id="an_14:10">14:10</span> And when all the multitude cried out,
and would have stoned them, the glory of the Lord appeared over the
tabernacle of the covenant to all the children of Israel.

<span id="an_14:11">14:11</span> And the Lord said to Moses: How long
will this people detract me? how long will they not believe me for all
the signs that I have wrought before them?

<span id="an_14:12">14:12</span> I will strike them therefore with
pestilence, and will consume them: but thee I will make a ruler over a
great nation, and a mightier than this is.

<span id="an_14:13">14:13</span> And Moses said to the Lord: That the
Egyptians, from the midst of whom thou hast brought forth this people,

<span id="an_14:14">14:14</span> And the inhabitants of this land, (who
have heard that thou, O Lord, art among this people, and art seen face
to face, and thy cloud protecteth them, and thou goest before them in a
pillar of a cloud by day, and in a pillar of fire by night,)

<span id="an_14:15">14:15</span> May hear that thou hast killed so great
a multitude as it were one man and may say:

<span id="an_14:16">14:16</span> He could not bring the people into the
land for which he had sworn, therefore did he kill them in the
wilderness.

<span id="an_14:17">14:17</span> Let their the strength of the Lord be
magnified, as thou hast sworn, saying:

<span id="an_14:18">14:18</span> The Lord is patient and full of mercy,
taking away iniquity and wickedness, and leaving no man clear, who
visitest the sins of the fathers upon the children unto the third and
fourth generation.

<span id="an_14:19">14:19</span> Forgive, I beseech thee, the sins of
this people, according to the greatness of thy mercy, as thou hast been
merciful to them from their going out of Egypt unto this place.

<span id="an_14:20">14:20</span> And the Lord said: I have forgiven
according to thy word.

<span id="an_14:21">14:21</span> As I live: and the whole earth shall be
filled with the glory of the Lord.

<span id="an_14:22">14:22</span> But yet all the men that have seen my
majesty, and the signs that I have done in Egypt, and in the wilderness,
and have tempted me now ten times, and have not obeyed my voice,

<span id="an_14:23">14:23</span> Shall not see the land for which I
aware to their fathers, neither shall any one of them that hath
detracted me behold it.

<span id="an_14:24">14:24</span> My servant Caleb, who being full of
another spirit hath followed me, I will bring into this land which he
hath gone round: and his seed shall possess it.

<span id="an_14:25">14:25</span> For the Amalecite and the Chanaanite
dwell in the valleys. To morrow remove the camp, and return into the
wilderness by the way of the Red Sea.

<span id="an_14:26">14:26</span> And the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron,
saying:

<span id="an_14:27">14:27</span> How long doth this wicked multitude
murmur against me? I have heard the murmurings of the children of
Israel.

<span id="an_14:28">14:28</span> Say therefore to them: As I live, saith
the Lord: According as you have spoken in my hearing, so will I do to
you.

<span id="an_14:29">14:29</span> fin the wilderness shall your carcasses
lie. All you that were numbered from twenty years old and upward, and
have murmured against me,

<span id="an_14:30">14:30</span> Shall not enter into the land, over
which I lifted up my bend to make you dwell therein, except Caleb the
son of Jephone, and Josue the son of Nun.

<span id="an_14:31">14:31</span> But your children, of whom you said,
that they should be a prey to the enemies, will I bring in: that they
may see the land which you have despised.

<span id="an_14:32">14:32</span> Your carcasses shall lie in the
wilderness.

<span id="an_14:33">14:33</span> Your children shall wander in the
desert forty years, and shall bear your fornication, until the carcasses
of their fathers be consumed ill the desert,

<span id="an_14:34">14:34</span> According to the number of the forty
days, wherein you viewed the land: a year shall be counted for a day.
And forty years you shall receive your iniquities, and shall know my
revenge:

<span id="an_14:35">14:35</span> For as I have spoken, so will I do to
all this wicked multitude, that hath risen up together against me: in
this wilderness shall it faint away and die.

<span id="an_14:36">14:36</span> Therefore all the men, whom Moses had
sent to view the land, and who at their return had made the whole
multitude to murmur against him, speaking ill of the land that it was
naught,

<span id="an_14:37">14:37</span> Died and were struck in the sight of
the Lord.

<span id="an_14:38">14:38</span> But Josue .the son of Nun. and Caleb
the son of Jephone lived, of all them that had gone to view the land.

<span id="an_14:39">14:39</span> And Moses spoke all these words to all
the children of Israel, and the people mourned exceedingly.

<span id="an_14:40">14:40</span> And behold rising up very early in the
morning, they went up to the top of the mountain, and said: We are ready
to go up to the place, of which the Lord hath spoken: for we have
sinned.

<span id="an_14:41">14:41</span> And Moses said to them: Why transgress
you the word of the Lord, which shall not succeed prosperously with you?

<span id="an_14:42">14:42</span> Go not up, for the Lord is not with
you: lest you fall before your enemies.

<span id="an_14:43">14:43</span> The Amalecite and the Chanaanite are
before you, and by their sword you shall fall, because you would not
consent to the Lord, neither will the Lord be with you.

<span id="an_14:44">14:44</span> But they being blinded went up to the
top of the mountain. But the ark of the testament of the Lord and Moses
departed not from the camp.

<span id="an_14:45">14:45</span> And the Amalecite came down, and the
Chanaanite that dwelt in the mountain: and smiting and slaying them
pursued them as far as Horma.

<span id="an_15:1">15:1</span> And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:

<span id="an_15:2">15:2</span> Speak to the children of Israel and thou
shalt say to them: When you shall be come into the land of your
habitation, which I will give you,

<span id="an_15:3">15:3</span> And shall make an offering to the Lord,
for a holocaust, or a victim, paying your vows, or voluntarily offering
gifts, or in your solemnities burning a sweet savour unto the Lord, of
oxen or of sheep:

<span id="an_15:4">15:4</span> Whosoever immolateth the victim, shall
offer a sacrifice of fine flour, the tenth part of an ephi, tempered
with the fourth part of a hin of oil:

<span id="an_15:5">15:5</span> And he shall give the same measure of
wine to pour out in libations for the holocaust or for the victim. For
every lamb,

<span id="an_15:6">15:6</span> And for every ram there shall be a
sacrifice of hour of two tenths, which shall be tempered with the third
part of a hin of oil:

<span id="an_15:7">15:7</span> And he shall offer the third part of the
same measure of wine for the libation, for a sweet savour to the Lord.

<span id="an_15:8">15:8</span> But when thou offerest a holocaust or
sacrifice of oxen, to fulfil thy vow or for victims of peace offerings,

<span id="an_15:9">15:9</span> Thou shalt give for every ox three tenths
of flour tempered with half a hin of oil,

<span id="an_15:10">15:10</span> And wine for libations of the same
measure, for an offering of most sweet savour to the Lord.

<span id="an_15:11">15:11</span> Thus shalt thou do

<span id="an_15:12">15:12</span> For every ox and ram and lamb and kid.

<span id="an_15:13">15:13</span> Both they that are born in the land,
and the strangers

<span id="an_15:14">15:14</span> Shall offer sacrifices after the same
rite.

<span id="an_15:15">15:15</span> There shall be all one law and judgment
both for you and for them who are strangers in the land.

<span id="an_15:16">15:16</span> And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:

<span id="an_15:17">15:17</span> Speak to the children of Israel, and
thou shalt say to them:

<span id="an_15:18">15:18</span> When you are come into the land which I
will give you,

<span id="an_15:19">15:19</span> And shall eat of the bread of that
country, you shall separate firstfruits to the Lord,

<span id="an_15:20">15:20</span> Of the things you eat. As you separate
firstfruits of your barnfloors:

<span id="an_15:21">15:21</span> So also shall you give firstfruits of
your dough to the Lord.

<span id="an_15:22">15:22</span> And if through ignorance you omit any
of these things, which the Lord hath spoken to Moses,

<span id="an_15:23">15:23</span> And by him hath commanded you, from the
day that he began to command and thenceforward,

<span id="an_15:24">15:24</span> And the multitude have forgotten to do
it: they shall offer a calf out of the herd, a holocaust for a most
sweet savour to the Lord, and the sacrifice and libations thereof, as
the ceremonies require, and a buck goat for sin:

<span id="an_15:25">15:25</span> And the priest shall pray for all the
multitude of the children of Israel: and it shall be forgiven them,
because they sinned ignorantly, offering notwithstanding a burnt
offering to the Lord for themselves and for their sin and their
ignorance:

<span id="an_15:26">15:26</span> And it shall be forgiven all the people
of the children of Israel: and the strangers that sojourn among them:
because it is the fault of all the people through ignorance.

<span id="an_15:27">15:27</span> But if one soul shall sin ignorantly,
he shall offer a she goat of a year old for his sin.

<span id="an_15:28">15:28</span> And the priest shall pray for him,
because he sinned ignorantly before the Lord: and he shall obtain his
pardon, and it shall be forgiven him.

<span id="an_15:29">15:29</span> The same law shall be for all that sin
by ignorance, whether they be natives or strangers.

<span id="an_15:30">15:30</span> But the soul that committeth any thing
through pride, whether he be born in the land or a stranger (because he
hath been rebellious against the Lord) shall be cut off from among his
people:

<span id="an_15:31">15:31</span> For he hath contemned the word the
Lord, and made void his precept: therefore shall he be destroyed, and
shall bear his iniquity.

<span id="an_15:32">15:32</span> And it came to pass, when the children
of Israel were in the wilderness, and had found a man gathering sticks
on the sabbath day,

<span id="an_15:33">15:33</span> That they brought him to Moses and
Aaron and the whole multitude.

<span id="an_15:34">15:34</span> And they put him into prison, not
knowing what they should do with him.

<span id="an_15:35">15:35</span> And the Lord said to Moses: Let that
man die, let all the multitude stone him without the camp.

<span id="an_15:36">15:36</span> And when they had brought him out, they
stoned him, and he died as the Lord had commanded.

<span id="an_15:37">15:37</span> The Lord also said to Moses:

<span id="an_15:38">15:38</span> Speak to the children of Israel, and
thou shalt tell them to make to themselves fringes in the corners of
their garments, putting in them ribands of blue:

<span id="an_15:39">15:39</span> That when they shall see them, they may
remember all the commandments of the Lord, and not follow their own
thoughts and eyes going astray after divers things,

<span id="an_15:40">15:40</span> But rather being mindful of the
precepts of the Lord, may do them and be holy to their Cod.

<span id="an_15:41">15:41</span> I am the Lord your God, who brought you
out of the land of Egypt, that I might be your God.

<span id="an_16:1">16:1</span> And behold Core the son of Isaar, the son
of Caath, the son of Levi, and Dathan and Abiron the sons of Eliab, and
Hon the son of Pheleth of the children of Ruben,

<span id="an_16:2">16:2</span> Rose lap against Moses, and with them two
hundred and fifty others of the children of Israel, leading men of the
synagogue, and who in the time of assembly were called by name.

<span id="an_16:3">16:3</span> And when they had stood up against Moses
and Aaron, they said: Let it be enough for you, that all the multitude
consisteth of holy ones, and the Lord is among them: Why lift you up
yourselves above the people of the Lord?

<span id="an_16:4">16:4</span> When Moses heard this, he fell flat on
his face:

<span id="an_16:5">16:5</span> And speaking to Core and all the
multitude, he said: In the morning the Lord will make known who belong
to him, and the holy he will join to himself: and whom he shall choose,
they shall approach to him.

<span id="an_16:6">16:6</span> Do this therefore: Take every man of you
your censers, thou Core, and all thy company.

<span id="an_16:7">16:7</span> And putting fire in them to morrow, put
incense upon it before the Lord: and whomsoever he shall choose, the
same shall be holy: you take too much upon you, ye sons of Levi.

<span id="an_16:8">16:8</span> And he said again to Core: Hear ye sons
of Levi.

<span id="an_16:9">16:9</span> Is it a small thing unto you, that the
God of Israel hath spared you from all the people, and joined you to
himself, that you should serve him in the service of the tabernacle, and
should stand before the congregation of the people, and should minister
to him?

<span id="an_16:10">16:10</span> Did he therefore make thee and all thy
brethren the sons of Levi to approach unto him, that you should
challenge to yourselves the priesthood also,

<span id="an_16:11">16:11</span> And that all thy company should stand
against the Lord ? for what is Aaron that you murmur against him?

<span id="an_16:12">16:12</span> Then Moses sent to call Dathan and
Abiron the sons of Eliab. But they answered: We will not come.

<span id="an_16:13">16:13</span> Is it a small matter to thee, that thou
hast brought us out of a land that flowed with milk and honey, to kill
us in the desert, except thou rule also like a lord over us?

<span id="an_16:14">16:14</span> Thou best brought us indeed into a land
that floweth with rivers of milk and honey, and hast given us
possessions of fields and vineyards; wilt thou also pull out our eyes?
We will not come.

<span id="an_16:15">16:15</span> Moses therefore being very angry, raid
to the Lord: Respect not their sacrifices: thou knowest that I have not
taken of them so much as a young ass at any time, nor have injured any
of them.

<span id="an_16:16">16:16</span> And he said to Core: Do thou and thy
congregation stand apart before the Lord to morrow, and Aaron apart.

<span id="an_16:17">16:17</span> Take every one of you censers, and put
incense upon them, offering to the Lord two hundred and fifty censers:
let Aaron also hold his censer.

<span id="an_16:18">16:18</span> When they had done this, Moses and
Aaron standing,

<span id="an_16:19">16:19</span> And had drawn up all the multitude
against them to the door of the tabernacle, the glory of the Lord
appeared to them all.

<span id="an_16:20">16:20</span> And the Lord speaking to Moses and
Aaron, said:

<span id="an_16:21">16:21</span> Separate yourselves from among this
congregation, that I may presently destroy them.

<span id="an_16:22">16:22</span> They fell flat on their face, and said:
O most mighty, the God of the spirits of all flesh, for one man's sin
shall thy wrath rage against all?

<span id="an_16:23">16:23</span> And the Lord said to Moses:

<span id="an_16:24">16:24</span> Command the whole people to separate
themselves from the tents of Core and Dathan and Abiron.

<span id="an_16:25">16:25</span> And Moses arose, and went to Dathan and
Abiron: and the ancients of Israel following him,

<span id="an_16:26">16:26</span> He said to the multitude: Depart from
the tents of these wicked men, and touch nothing of theirs, lest you be
involved in their sins.

<span id="an_16:27">16:27</span> And when they were departed from their
tents round about, Dathan and Abiron coming out stood in the entry of
their pavilions with their wives and children, and all the people.

<span id="an_16:28">16:28</span> And Moses said: By this you shall know
that the Lord hath sent me to do all things that you see, and that I
have not forged them of my own head:

<span id="an_16:29">16:29</span> If these men die the common death of
men, and if they be visited with a plague, wherewith others also are
wont to be visited, the Lord did not send me.

<span id="an_16:30">16:30</span> But if the Lord do a new thing, and the
earth opening her mouth swallow them down, and all things that belong to
them, and they go down alive into hell, you shall know that they have
blasphemed the Lord.

<span id="an_16:31">16:31</span> And immediately as he had made an end
of speaking, the earth broke asunder under their feet:

<span id="an_16:32">16:32</span> And opening her mouth, devoured them
with their tents and all their substance.

<span id="an_16:33">16:33</span> And they went down alive into hell the
ground closing upon them, and they perished from among the people.

<span id="an_16:34">16:34</span> But all Israel, that was standing round
about, fled at the cry of them that were perishing: saying: Lest perhaps
the earth swallow us up also.

<span id="an_16:35">16:35</span> And a fire coming out from the Lord,
destroyed the two hundred and fifty men that offered the incense.

<span id="an_16:36">16:36</span> And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:

<span id="an_16:37">16:37</span> Command Eleazar the son of Aaron the
priest to take up the censers that lie in the burning, and to scatter
the fire of one side and the other: because they are sanctified

<span id="an_16:38">16:38</span> In the deaths of the sinners: and let
him beat them into plates, and fasten them to the altar, because incense
hath been offered in them to the Lord, and they are sanctified, that the
children of Israel may see them for a sign and a memorial.

<span id="an_16:39">16:39</span> Then Eleazar the priest took the brazen
censers, wherein they had offered, whom the burning fire had devoured,
and beat them into plates, fastening them to the altar:

<span id="an_16:40">16:40</span> That the children of Israel might have
for the time to come wherewith they should be admonished, that no
stranger or any one that is not of seed of Aaron should come near to
offer incense to the Lord, lest he should suffer as Core suffered, and
all his congregation, according as the Lord spoke to Moses.

<span id="an_16:41">16:41</span> The following day all the multitude of
the children of Israel murmured against Moses and Aaron, saying: You
have killed the people of the Lord.

<span id="an_16:42">16:42</span> And when there arose a sedition, and
the tumult increased,

<span id="an_16:43">16:43</span> Moses and Aaron fled to the tabernacle
of the covenant. And when the were gone into it, the cloud covered it,
and the glory of the Lord appeared.

<span id="an_16:44">16:44</span> And the Lord said to Moses:

<span id="an_16:45">16:45</span> Get you out from the midst of this
multitude, this moment will I destroy them. And as they were lying on
the ground,

<span id="an_16:46">16:46</span> Moses said to Aaron: Take the censer,
and putting fire in it from the altar, put incense upon it, and go
quickly to the people to pray for them: for already wrath is gone out
from the Lord, and the plague rageth.

<span id="an_16:47">16:47</span> When Aaron had done this, and had run
to the midst of the multitude which the burning fire was now destroying,
he offered the incense:

<span id="an_16:48">16:48</span> And standing between the dead and the
living, he prayed for the people, and the plague ceased.

<span id="an_16:49">16:49</span> And the number of them that were slain
was fourteen thousand and seven hundred men, besides them that had
perished in the sedition of Core.

<span id="an_16:50">16:50</span> And Aaron returned to Moses to the door
of the tabernacle of the covenant after the destruction was over.

<span id="an_17:1">17:1</span> And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:

<span id="an_17:2">17:2</span> Speak to the children of Israel, and take
of every one of them a rod by their kindreds, of all the princes of the
tribes, twelve rods, and write the name of every man upon his rod.

<span id="an_17:3">17:3</span> And the name of Aaron shall be for the
tribe of Levi, and one rod shall contain all their families:

<span id="an_17:4">17:4</span> And thou shalt lay them up in the
tabernacle of the covenant before the testimony, where I will speak to
thee.

<span id="an_17:5">17:5</span> Whomsoever of these I shall choose, his
rod shall blossom: and I will make to cease from me the murmurings of
the children of Israel, wherewith they murmur against you.

<span id="an_17:6">17:6</span> And Moses spoke to the children of
Israel: and all the princes gave him rods one for every tribe: and there
were twelve rods besides the rod of Aaron.

<span id="an_17:7">17:7</span> And when Moses had laid them up before
the Lord in the tabernacle of the testimony:

<span id="an_17:8">17:8</span> He returned on the following day, and
found that the rod of Aaron for the house of Levi, was budded: and that
the buds swelling it had bloomed blossoms, which spreading the leaves,
were formed into almonds.

<span id="an_17:9">17:9</span> Moses therefore brought out all the rods
from before the Lord to all the children of Israel: and they saw, and
every one received their rods.

<span id="an_17:10">17:10</span> And the Lord said to Moses: Carry back
the rod of Aaron into the tabernacle of the testimony, that it may be
kept there for a token of the rebellious children of Israel, and that
their complaints may cease from me lest they die.

<span id="an_17:11">17:11</span> And Moses did as the Lord had
commanded.

<span id="an_17:12">17:12</span> And the children of Israel said to
Moses: Behold we are consumed, we all perish.

<span id="an_17:13">17:13</span> Whosoever approacheth to the tabernacle
of the Lord, he dieth. Are we all to a man to be utterly destroyed?

<span id="an_18:1">18:1</span> And the Lord said to Aaron: Thou, and thy
sons, and thy father's house with thee shall bear the iniquity of the
sanctuary: and thou and thy sons with thee shall bear the sins of your
priesthood.

<span id="an_18:2">18:2</span> And take with thee thy brethren also of
the tribe of Levi, and the sceptre of thy father, and let them be ready
in hand, and minister to thee: but thou and thy sons shall minister in
the tabernacle of the testimony.

<span id="an_18:3">18:3</span> And the Levites shall watch to do thy
commands, and about all the works of the tabernacle: only they shall not
come nigh the vessels of the sanctuary nor the altar, lest both they
die, and you also perish with them.

<span id="an_18:4">18:4</span> But let them be with thee, and watch in
the charge of the tabernacle, and in all the ceremonies thereof. A
stranger shall not join himself with you.

<span id="an_18:5">18:5</span> Watch ye in the charge of the sanctuary,
and in the ministry of the altar: lest indignation rise upon the
children of Israel.

<span id="an_18:6">18:6</span> I have given you your brethren the
Levites from among the children of Israel, and have delivered them for a
gift to the Lord, to serve in the ministries of the tabernacle.

<span id="an_18:7">18:7</span> But thou and thy sons look ye to the
priesthood: and all things that pertain to the service of the altar, and
that are within the veil, shall be executed by the priests. If any
stranger shall approach, he shall be slain.

<span id="an_18:8">18:8</span> And the Lord said to Aaron: Behold I have
given thee the charge of my firstfruits. All things that are sanctified
by the children of Israel, I have delivered to thee and to thy sons for
the priestly office, by everlasting ordinances.

<span id="an_18:9">18:9</span> These therefore shalt thou take of the
things that are sanctified, and are offered to the Lord. Every offering,
and sacrifice, and whatsoever is rendered to me for sin and for
trespass, and becometh holy of holies, shall be for thee and thy sons.

<span id="an_18:10">18:10</span> Thou shalt eat it in the sanctuary: the
males only shall eat thereof, because it is a consecrated thing to thee.

<span id="an_18:11">18:11</span> But the firstfruits, which the children
of Israel shall vow and offer, I have given to thee, and to thy sons,
and to thy daughters, by a perpetual law. He that is clean in thy house,
shall eat them.

<span id="an_18:12">18:12</span> All the best of the oil, and of the
wine, and of the corn, whatsoever firstfruits they offer to the Lord, I
have given them to thee.

<span id="an_18:13">18:13</span> All the firstripe of the fruits, that
the ground bringeth forth, and which are brought to the Lord, shall be
for thy use: he that is clean in thy house, shall eat them.

<span id="an_18:14">18:14</span> Every thing that the children of Israel
shall give by vow, shall be thine.

<span id="an_18:15">18:15</span> Whatsoever is firstborn of all flesh,
which they offer to the Lord, whether it be of men, or of beasts, shall
belong to thee: only for the firstborn of man thou shalt take a price,
and every beast that is unclean thou shalt cause to be redeemed,

<span id="an_18:16">18:16</span> And the redemption of it shall be after
one month, for five sicles of silver, by the weight of the sanctuary. A
sicle hath twenty obols.

<span id="an_18:17">18:17</span> But the firstling of a cow and of a
sheep and of a goat thou shalt not cause to be redeemed, because they
are sanctified to the Lord. Their blood only thou shalt pour upon the
altar, and their fat thou shalt burn for a most sweet odour to the Lord.

<span id="an_18:18">18:18</span> But the flesh shall fall to thy use, as
the consecrated breast, and the right shoulder shall be thine.

<span id="an_18:19">18:19</span> All the firstfruits of the sanctuary
which the children of Israel offer to the Lord, I have given to thee and
to thy sons and daughters, by a perpetual ordinance. It is a covenant of
salt for ever before the Lord, to thee and to thy sons.

<span id="an_18:20">18:20</span> And the Lord said to Aaron: You shall
possess nothing in their land, neither shall you have a portion among
them: I am thy portion and inheritance in the midst of the children of
Israel.

<span id="an_18:21">18:21</span> And I have given to the sons of Levi
all the tithes of Israel for a possession for the ministry wherewith
they serve me in the tabernacle of the covenant:

<span id="an_18:22">18:22</span> That the children of Israel may not
approach any more to the tabernacle, nor commit deadly sin,

<span id="an_18:23">18:23</span> But only the sons of Levi may serve me
in the tabernacle, and bear the sins of the people. It shall be an
everlasting ordinance in your generations. They shall not possess any
other thing,

<span id="an_18:24">18:24</span> But be content with the oblation or
tithes, which I have separated for their uses and necessities.

<span id="an_18:25">18:25</span> And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:

<span id="an_18:26">18:26</span> Command the Levites, and declare unto
them: When you shall receive of the children of Israel the tithes, which
I have given you, offer the firstfruits of them to the Lord, that is to
say, the tenth part of the tenth:

<span id="an_18:27">18:27</span> That it may be reckoned to you as an
oblation of firstfruits, as well of the barnfloors as of the
winepresses:

<span id="an_18:28">18:28</span> And of all the things of which you
receive tithes, offer the firstfruits to the Lord, and give them to
Aaron the priest.

<span id="an_18:29">18:29</span> All the things that you shall offer of
the tithes, and shall separate for the gifts of the Lord, shall be the
best and choicest things.

<span id="an_18:30">18:30</span> And thou shalt say to them: If you
offer all the goodly and the better things of the tithes, it shall be
reckoned to you as if you had given the firstfruits of the barnfloor and
the winepress:

<span id="an_18:31">18:31</span> And you shall eat them in all your
places, both you and your families: because it is your reward for the
ministry, wherewith you serve in the tabernacle of the testimony.

<span id="an_18:32">18:32</span> And you shall not sin in this point, by
reserving the choicest and fat things to yourselves, lest you profane
the oblations of the children of Israel, and die.

<span id="an_19:1">19:1</span> And the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron,
saying:

<span id="an_19:2">19:2</span> This is the observance of the victim,
which the Lord hath ordained. Command the children of Israel, that they
bring unto thee a red cow of full age, in which there is no blemish, and
which hath not carried the yoke:

<span id="an_19:3">19:3</span> And you shall deliver her to Eleazar the
priest, who shall bring her forth without the camp, and shall immolate
her in the sight of all:

<span id="an_19:4">19:4</span> And dipping his finger in her blood,
shall sprinkle it over against the door of the tabernacle seven times,

<span id="an_19:5">19:5</span> And shall burn her in the sight of all,
delivering up to the fire her skin, and her flesh, and her blood, and
her dung.

<span id="an_19:6">19:6</span> The priest shall also take cedar wood,
and hyssop, and scarlet twice dyed, and cast it into the flame, with
which the cow is consumed.

<span id="an_19:7">19:7</span> And then after washing his garments, and
body, he shall enter into the camp, and shall be unclean until the
evening.

<span id="an_19:8">19:8</span> He also that hath burned her, shall wash
his garments, and his body, and shall be unclean until the evening.

<span id="an_19:9">19:9</span> And a man that is clean shall gather up
the ashes of the cow, and shall pour them forth without the camp in a
most clean place, that they may be reserved for the multitude of the
children of Israel, and for a water of aspersion: because the cow was
burnt for sin.

<span id="an_19:10">19:10</span> And when he that carried the ashes of
the cow, hath washed his garments, he shall be unclean until the
evening. The children of Israel, and the strangers that dwell among
them, shall observe this for a holy thing by a perpetual ordinance.

<span id="an_19:11">19:11</span> He that toucheth the corpse of a man,
and is therefore unclean seven days,

<span id="an_19:12">19:12</span> Shall be sprinkled with this water on
the third day, and on the seventh, and so shall be cleansed. If he were
not sprinkled on the third day, he cannot be cleansed on the seventh.

<span id="an_19:13">19:13</span> Every one that toucheth the corpse of a
man, and is not sprinkled with mixture, shall profane the tabernacle of
the Lord, and shall perish out of Israel: because he was not sprinkled
with the water of expiation, he shall be unclean, and his uncleanness
shall remain upon him.

<span id="an_19:14">19:14</span> This is the law of a mall that dieth in
a tent: All that go into his tent and all the vessels that are there,
shall be unclean seven days.

<span id="an_19:15">19:15</span> The vessel that hath no cover, nor
binding over it, shall be unclean.

<span id="an_19:16">19:16</span> If any man in the field touch the
corpse of a man that was slain, or that died of himself, or his bone, or
his grave, he shall be unclean seven days.

<span id="an_19:17">19:17</span> And they shall take of the ashes of the
burning and of the sin offering, and shall pour living waters upon them
into a vessel.

<span id="an_19:18">19:18</span> And a man that is clean shall dip
hyssop in them, and shall sprinkle therewith all the tent, and all the
furniture, and the men that are defiled with touching any such thing:

<span id="an_19:19">19:19</span> And in this manner he that is clean
shall purify the unclean on the third and on the seventh day. And being
expiated the seventh day, he shall wash both himself and his garments,
and be unclean until the evening.

<span id="an_19:20">19:20</span> If any man be not expiated after this
rite, his soul shall perish out of the midst of the church: because he
hath profaned the sanctuary of the Lord, and was not sprinkled with the
water of purification.

<span id="an_19:21">19:21</span> This precept shall be an ordinance for
ever. He also that sprinkled the water, shall wash his garments. Every
one that shall touch the waters of expiation, shall be unclean until the
evening.

<span id="an_19:22">19:22</span> Whatsoever a person toucheth who is
unclean, he shall make it unclean: and the person that toucheth any of
these things, shall be unclean until the evening.

<span id="an_20:1">20:1</span> And the children of Israel, and all the
multitude came into the desert of Sin, in the first month: and the
people abode in Cades. And Mary died there, and was buried in the same
place.

<span id="an_20:2">20:2</span> And the people wanting water, came
together against Moses and Aaron:

<span id="an_20:3">20:3</span> And making a sedition, they said: Would
God we had perished among our brethren before the Lord.

<span id="an_20:4">20:4</span> Why have you brought out the church of
the Lord into the wilderness, that both we and our cattle should die?

<span id="an_20:5">20:5</span> Why have you made us come up out of
Egypt, and have brought us into this wretched place which cannot be
sowed, nor bringeth forth figs, nor vines, nor pomegranates, neither is
there any water to drink?

<span id="an_20:6">20:6</span> And Moses and Aaron leaving the
multitude, went into the tabernacle of the covenant, and fell flat upon
the ground, and cried to the Lord, and said: O Lord God, hear the cry of
this people, and open to them thy treasure, a fountain of living water,
that being satisfied, they may cease to murmur. And the glory of the
Lord appeared over them.

<span id="an_20:7">20:7</span> And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:

<span id="an_20:8">20:8</span> Take the rod, and assemble the people
together, thou and Aaron thy brother, and speak to the rock before them,
and it shall yield waters. And when thou hast brought forth water out of
the rock, all the multitude and their cattle shall drink.

<span id="an_20:9">20:9</span> Moses therefore took the rod, which was
before the Lord, as he had commanded him,

<span id="an_20:10">20:10</span> And having gathered together the
multitude before the rock, he said to them: Hear, ye rebellious and
incredulous: Can we bring you forth water out of this rock?

<span id="an_20:11">20:11</span> And when Moses had lifted up his hand,
and struck the rook twice with the rod, there came forth water in great
abundance, so that the people and their cattle drank,

<span id="an_20:12">20:12</span> And the Lord said to Moses and Aaron:
Because you have not believed me, to sanctify me before the children of
Israel, you shall not bring these people into the land, which I will
give them.

<span id="an_20:13">20:13</span> This is the Water of contradiction,
where the children of Israel strove with words against the Lord, and he
was sanctified in them.

<span id="an_20:14">20:14</span> In the mean time Moses sent messengers
from Cades to the king of Edom, to say: Thus saith thy brother Israel:
Thou knowest all the labour that hath come upon us:

<span id="an_20:15">20:15</span> In what manner our fathers went down
into Egypt, and there we dwelt a long time, and the Egyptians afflicted
us and our fathers.

<span id="an_20:16">20:16</span> And how we cried to the Lord, and he
heard us, and sent an angel, who hath brought us out of Egypt. Lo, we
are now in the city of Cades, which is in the uttermost of thy borders,

<span id="an_20:17">20:17</span> And we beseech thee that we may have
leave to pass through thy country. We will not go through the fields,
nor through the vineyards, we will not drink the waters of thy wells,
but we will go by the common highway, neither turning aside to the right
hand, nor to the left, till we are past thy borders.

<span id="an_20:18">20:18</span> And Edom answered them: Thou shalt not
pass by me: if thou dost I will come out armed against thee.

<span id="an_20:19">20:19</span> And the children of Israel said: We
will go by the beaten way: and if we and our cattle drink of thy waters,
we will give thee what is just: there shall be no difficulty in the
price, only let us pass speedily.

<span id="an_20:20">20:20</span> But he answered: Thou shalt not pass.
And immediately he came forth to meet them with an infinite multitude,
and a strong hand,

<span id="an_20:21">20:21</span> Neither would he condescend to their
desire to grant them passage through his borders. Wherefore Israel
turned another way from him.

<span id="an_20:22">20:22</span> And when they had removed the camp from
Cades, they came to mount Her, which is in the borders of the land of
Edom:

<span id="an_20:23">20:23</span> Where the Lord spoke to Moses:

<span id="an_20:24">20:24</span> Let Aaron, saith he, go to his people:
for he shall not go into the land which I have given the children of
Israel, because he was incredulous to my words, at the waters of
contradiction.

<span id="an_20:25">20:25</span> Take Aaron and his son with him, and
bring them up into mount Hor:

<span id="an_20:26">20:26</span> And when thou hast stripped the father
of his vesture, thou shalt vest therewith Eleazar his son: Aaron shall
be gathered to his people, and die there.

<span id="an_20:27">20:27</span> Moses did as the Lord had commanded:
and they went up into mount Hor before all the multitude.

<span id="an_20:28">20:28</span> And when he had stripped Aaron of his
vestments, he vested Eleazar his son with them.

<span id="an_20:29">20:29</span> And Aaron being dead in the top of the
mountain, he came down with Eleazar.

<span id="an_20:30">20:30</span> And all the multitude seeing that Aaron
was dead, mourned for him thirty days throughout all their families.

<span id="an_21:1">21:1</span> And when king Arad the Chanaanite, who
dwelt towards the south, had heard this, to wit, that Israel was come by
the way of the spies, he fought against them, and overcoming them
carried off their spoils.

<span id="an_21:2">21:2</span> But Israel binding himself by vow to the
Lord, said: It thou wilt deliver this people into my hand, I will
utterly destroy their cities.

<span id="an_21:3">21:3</span> And the Lord heard the prayers of Israel,
and delivered up the Chanaanite, and they cut them off and destroyed
their cities: and they called the name of that place Horma, that is to
say, Anathema.

<span id="an_21:4">21:4</span> And they marched from mount Hor, by the
way that leadeth to the Red Sea, to compass the land of Edom. And the
people began to be weary of their journey and labour:

<span id="an_21:5">21:5</span> And speaking against God end Moses, they
said: Why didst thou bring us out of Egypt, to die in the wilderness?
There is no bread, nor have we any waters: our soul now loatheth this
very light food.

<span id="an_21:6">21:6</span> Wherefore the Lord sent among the people
fiery serpents, which bit them and killed many of them.

<span id="an_21:7">21:7</span> Upon which they came to Moses, and said:
We have sinned, because we have spoken against the Lord and thee: pray
that he may take away these serpents from us. And Moses prayed for the
people.

<span id="an_21:8">21:8</span> And the Lord said to him: Make brazen
serpent, and set it up for a sign: whosoever being struck shall look on
it, shall live.

<span id="an_21:9">21:9</span> Moses therefore made a brazen serpent,
and set it up for a sign: which when they that were bitten looked upon,
they were healed.

<span id="an_21:10">21:10</span> And the children of Israel setting
forwards camped in Oboth.

<span id="an_21:11">21:11</span> And departing thence they pitched their
tents in Jeabarim, in the wilderness, that faceth Moab toward the east.

<span id="an_21:12">21:12</span> And removing from thence, they came to
the torrent Zared:

<span id="an_21:13">21:13</span> Which they left and encamped over
against Arnon, which is in the desert and standeth out on the borders of
the Amorrhite. For Arnon is the border of Moab, dividing the Moabites
and the Amorrhites.

<span id="an_21:14">21:14</span> Wherefore it is said in the book of the
wars of the Lord: As he did in the Red Sea, so will he do in the streams
of Amen.

<span id="an_21:15">21:15</span> The rocks of the torrents were bowed
down that they might rest in Ar, and lie down in the borders of the
Moabites.

<span id="an_21:16">21:16</span> When they went from that place, the
well appeared whereof the Lord said to Moses: Gather the people
together, and I will give them water.

<span id="an_21:17">21:17</span> Then Israel sung this song: Let the
well spring up. They sung thereto:

<span id="an_21:18">21:18</span> The well, which the princes dug, and
the chiefs of the people prepared by the direction of the lawgiver, and
with their staves. And they marched from the wilderness to Mathana.

<span id="an_21:19">21:19</span> From Mathana unto Nahaliel: from
Nahaliel unto Bamoth.

<span id="an_21:20">21:20</span> From Bamoth, is a valley in the country
of Moab, to the top of Phasga, which looked towards the desert.

<span id="an_21:21">21:21</span> And Israel sent messengers to Sehon
king of the Amorrhites, saying:

<span id="an_21:22">21:22</span> I beseech thee that I may have leave to
pass through thy land: we will not go aside into the fields or the
vineyards, we will not drink waters of the wells, we will go the king's
highway, till we be past thy borders.

<span id="an_21:23">21:23</span> And he would not grant that Israel
should pass by his borders: but rather gathering an army, went forth to
meet them in the desert, and came to Jasa, and fought against them.

<span id="an_21:24">21:24</span> And he was slain by them with the edge
of the sword, and they possessed his land from the Arnon unto the Jeboc,
and to the confines of the children of Ammon: for the borders of the
Ammonites, were kept with a strong garrison.

<span id="an_21:25">21:25</span> So Israel took all his cities, and
dwelt in the cities of the Amorrhite, to wit, in Hesebon, and in the
villages thereof.

<span id="an_21:26">21:26</span> Hesebon was the city of Sehon the king
of the Amorrhites, who fought against the king of Moab: and took all the
land, that had been of his dominions, as far as the Arnon.

<span id="an_21:27">21:27</span> Therefore it is said in the proverb:
Come into Hesebon, let the city of Sehon be built and set up:

<span id="an_21:28">21:28</span> A fire is gone out of Hesebon, a flame
from the city of Sehon, and hath consumed Ar of the Moabites, and the
inhabitants of the high places of the Arnon.

<span id="an_21:29">21:29</span> Woe to thee Moab: thou art undone, O
people of Chamos. He hath given his sons to flight, and his daughters
into captivity to Sehon the king of the Amorrhites.

<span id="an_21:30">21:30</span> Their yoke is perished from Hesebon
unto Dibon, they came weary to Nophe, and unto Medaba.

<span id="an_21:31">21:31</span> So Israel dwelt in the land of the
Amorrhite.

<span id="an_21:32">21:32</span> And Moses sent some to take a view of
Jazer: and they took the villages of it, and conquered the inhabitants.

<span id="an_21:33">21:33</span> And they turned themselves, and went up
by the way of Basan, and Og the king of Basan came against them with all
his people, to fight in Edrai.

<span id="an_21:34">21:34</span> And the Lord said to Moses: Fear him
not, for I have delivered him and all his people, and his country into
thy hand: and thou shalt do to him as thou didst to Sehon the king of
the Amorrhites, the inhabitant of Hesebon.

<span id="an_21:35">21:35</span> So they slew him also with his sons,
and all his people, not letting any one escape, and they possessed his
land.

<span id="an_22:1">22:1</span> And they went forward and encamped in the
plains of Moab, over against where Jericho is situate beyond the Jordan.

<span id="an_22:2">22:2</span> And Balac the son of Sephor, seeing all
that Israel had done to the Amorrhite,

<span id="an_22:3">22:3</span> And that the Moabites were in great fear
of him, and were not able to sustain his assault,

<span id="an_22:4">22:4</span> He said to the elders of Madian: So will
this people destroy all that dwell in our borders, as the ox is wont to
eat the grass to the very roots. Now he was at that time king in Moab.

<span id="an_22:5">22:5</span> He sent therefore messengers to Balaam
the son of Beer, a soothsayer, who dwelt by the river of the land of the
children of Ammon, to call him, and to say: Behold a people is come out
of Egypt, that hath covered the face of the earth, sitting over against
me.

<span id="an_22:6">22:6</span> Come therefore, and curse this people,
because it is mightier than I: if by any means I may beat them and drive
them out of my land: for I know that he whom thou shalt bless is
blessed, and he whom thou shalt curse is cursed.

<span id="an_22:7">22:7</span> And the ancients of Moab, and the elders
of Madian, went with the price of divination in their hands. And when
they were come to Balaam, and had told him all the words of Balac:

<span id="an_22:8">22:8</span> He answered: Tarry here this night, and I
will answer whatsoever the Lord shall say to me. And while they stayed
with Balaam, God came and said to him:

<span id="an_22:9">22:9</span> What mean these men that are with thee?

<span id="an_22:10">22:10</span> He answered: Balac the son of Sephor
king of the Moabites hath sent to me,

<span id="an_22:11">22:11</span> Saying: Behold a people that is come
out of Egypt, hath covered the face of the land: come and curse them, if
by any means I may fight with them and drive them away.

<span id="an_22:12">22:12</span> And God said to Balaam : Thou shalt not
go with them, nor shalt thou curse the people: because it is blessed.

<span id="an_22:13">22:13</span> And he rose in the morning and said to
the princes: Go into your country, because the Lord hath forbid me to
come with you.

<span id="an_22:14">22:14</span> The princes returning, said to Balac:
Balaam would not come with us.

<span id="an_22:15">22:15</span> Then he sent many more and more noble
than he had sent before:

<span id="an_22:16">22:16</span> Who, when they were come to Balaam,
said: Thus saith Balac the son of Sephor, Delay not to come to me:

<span id="an_22:17">22:17</span> For I am ready to honour thee, and will
give thee whatsoever thou wilt: come and curse this people.

<span id="an_22:18">22:18</span> Balaam answered: If Balac would give me
his house full of silver and gold, I cannot alter the word of the Lord
my God, to speak either more or less.

<span id="an_22:19">22:19</span> I pray you to stay here this night
also, that I may know what the Lord will answer me once more.

<span id="an_22:20">22:20</span> God therefore came to Balaam in the
night, and said to him: It these men be come to call thee, arise and go
with them: yet so, that thou do what I shall command thee.

<span id="an_22:21">22:21</span> Balaam arose in the morning, and
saddling his ass went with them.

<span id="an_22:22">22:22</span> And God was angry. And an angel of the
Lord stood in the way against Balaam, who sat on the ass, and had two
servants with him.

<span id="an_22:23">22:23</span> The ass seeing the angel standing in
the way, with a drawn sword, turned herself out of the way, and went
into the field. And when Balaam beat her, and had a mind to bring her
again to the way,

<span id="an_22:24">22:24</span> The angel stood in a narrow place
between two walls, wherewith the vineyards were enclosed.

<span id="an_22:25">22:25</span> And the ass seeing him, thrust herself
close to the wall, and bruised the foot of the rider. But he beat her
again:

<span id="an_22:26">22:26</span> And nevertheless the angel going on to
a narrow place, where there was no way to turn aside either to the right
hand or to the left, stood to meet him.

<span id="an_22:27">22:27</span> And when the ass saw the angel
standing, she fell under the feet of the rider: who being angry beat her
sides more vehemently with a staff.

<span id="an_22:28">22:28</span> And the Lord opened the mouth of the
ass, and she said: What have I done to thee? Why strikest thou me, lo,
now this third time?

<span id="an_22:29">22:29</span> Balaam answered: Because thou hast
deserved it, and hast served me ill: I would I had a sword that I might
kill thee.

<span id="an_22:30">22:30</span> The ass said: Am not I thy beast, on
which thou hast been always accustomed to ride until this present day?
tell me if I ever did the like thing to thee. But he said: Never.

<span id="an_22:31">22:31</span> Forthwith the Lord opened the eyes of
Balaam, and he saw the angel standing in the way with a drawn sword, and
he worshipped him falling flat on the ground.

<span id="an_22:32">22:32</span> And the angel said to him: Why beatest
thou thy ass these three times? I am come to withstand thee, because thy
way is perverse, and contrary to me:

<span id="an_22:33">22:33</span> And unless the ass had turned out of
the way, giving place to me who stood against thee, I had slain thee,
and she should have lived.

<span id="an_22:34">22:34</span> Balaam said: I have sinned, not knowing
that thou didst stand against me: and now if it displease thee that I
go, I will return.

<span id="an_22:35">22:35</span> The angel said: Go with these men, and
see thou speak no other thing than what I shall command thee. He went
therefore with the princes.

<span id="an_22:36">22:36</span> And when Balac heard it he came forth
to meet him in a town of the Moabites, that is situate in the uttermost
borders of Arnon.

<span id="an_22:37">22:37</span> And he said to Balaam: I sent
messengers to call thee, why didst thou not come immediately to me? was
it because I am not able to reward thy coming?

<span id="an_22:38">22:38</span> He answered him: Lo, here I am: shall I
have power to speak any other thing but that which God shall put in my
mouth?

<span id="an_22:39">22:39</span> So they went on together, and came into
a city, that was in the uttermost borders of his kingdom.

<span id="an_22:40">22:40</span> And when Balac had killed oxen and
sheep, he sent presents to Balaam, and to the princes that were with
him.

<span id="an_22:41">22:41</span> And when morning was come, he brought
him to the high places of Baal, and he beheld the uttermost part of the
people.

<span id="an_23:1">23:1</span> And Balaam said to Balac: Build me here
seven altars, and prepare as many calves, and the same number of rams.

<span id="an_23:2">23:2</span> And when he had done according to the
word of Balaam, they laid together a calf and a ram upon every altar.

<span id="an_23:3">23:3</span> And Balaam said to Balac: Stand a while
by thy burnt offering, until I go, to see if perhaps the Lord will meet
me, and whatsoever he shall command, I will speak to thee.

<span id="an_23:4">23:4</span> And when he was gone with speed, God met
him. And Balaam speaking to him, said: I have erected seven altars, and
have laid on everyone a calf and a ram.

<span id="an_23:5">23:5</span> And the Lord put the word in his mouth,
and said: Return to Balac, and thus shalt thou speak.

<span id="an_23:6">23:6</span> Returning he found Balac standing by his
burnt offering, with all the princes of the Moabites:

<span id="an_23:7">23:7</span> And taking up his parable, he said: Balac
king of the Moabites hath brought me from Aram, from the mountains of
the east: Come, said he, and curse Jacob: make haste and detest Israel.

<span id="an_23:8">23:8</span> How shall I curse him, whom God hath not
cursed? By what means should I detest him, whom the Lord detesteth not?

<span id="an_23:9">23:9</span> I shall see him from the tops of the
rocks, and shall consider him from the hills. This people shall dwell
alone, and shall not be reckoned among the nations.

<span id="an_23:10">23:10</span> Who can count the dust of Jacob, and
know the number of the stock of Israel? Let my soul die the death of the
just, and my last end be like to them.

<span id="an_23:11">23:11</span> And Balac said to Balaam: What is this
that thou dost? I sent for thee to curse my enemies: and thou
contrariwise blessest them.

<span id="an_23:12">23:12</span> He answered him: Call I speak any thing
else but what the Lord commandeth?

<span id="an_23:13">23:13</span> Balac therefore said: Come with me to
another place from whence thou mayest see part of Israel, and canst not
see them all: curse them from thence.

<span id="an_23:14">23:14</span> And when he had brought him to a high
place, upon the top of mount Phasga, Balaam built seven altars, and
laying on every one a calf and a ram,

<span id="an_23:15">23:15</span> He said to Balac: Stand here by thy
burnt offering while I go to meet him.

<span id="an_23:16">23:16</span> And when the Lord had met him, and had
put the word in his mouth, he said: Return to Balac, and thus shalt thou
say to him.

<span id="an_23:17">23:17</span> Returning he found him standing by his
burnt sacrifice, and the princes of the Moabites with him. And Balac
said to him: What hath the Lord spoken?

<span id="an_23:18">23:18</span> But he taking up his parable, said:
Stand, O Balac, and give ear: hear, thou son of Sephor:

<span id="an_23:19">23:19</span> God is not a man, that he should lie,
nor as the son of man, that he should be changed. Hath he said then, and
will he not do? hath he spoken, and will he not fulfil?

<span id="an_23:20">23:20</span> I was brought to bless, the blessing I
am not able to hinder.

<span id="an_23:21">23:21</span> There is no idol in Jacob, neither is
there an image god to be seen in Israel. The Lord his God is with him,
and the sound of the victory of the king in him.

<span id="an_23:22">23:22</span> God hath brought him out of Egypt,
whose strength is like to the rhinoceros.

<span id="an_23:23">23:23</span> There is no soothsaying in Jacob, nor
divination in Israel. In their times it shall be told to Jacob and to
Israel what God hath wrought.

<span id="an_23:24">23:24</span> Behold the people shall rise up as a
lioness, and shall lift itself up as a lion: it shall not lie down till
it devour the prey, and drink the blood of the slain.

<span id="an_23:25">23:25</span> And Balac said to Balaam: Neither
curse, nor bless him.

<span id="an_23:26">23:26</span> And he said: Did I not tell thee, that
whatsoever God should command me, that I would do?

<span id="an_23:27">23:27</span> And Balac said to him: Come and I will
bring thee to another place; if peradventure it please God that thou
mayest curse them from thence.

<span id="an_23:28">23:28</span> And when he had brought him upon the
top of mount Phogor, which looketh towards the wilderness,

<span id="an_23:29">23:29</span> Balaam said to him: Build me here seven
altars, and prepare as many calves, and the same number of rams.

<span id="an_23:30">23:30</span> Balac did as Balaam had said: and he
laid on every altar, a calf and a ram.

<span id="an_24:1">24:1</span> And when Balaam saw that it pleased the
Lord that he should bless Israel. he went not as he had gone before, to
seek divination: but setting his face towards the desert,

<span id="an_24:2">24:2</span> And lifting up his eyes, he saw Israel
abiding in their tents by their tribes: and the spirit of God rushing
upon him,

<span id="an_24:3">24:3</span> He took up his parable and said: Balaam
the son of Beor hath said: The man hath said, whose eye ire stopped up:

<span id="an_24:4">24:4</span> The hearer of the words of God hath said,
he that hath beheld the vision of the Almighty, he that falleth, and so
his eyes are opened:

<span id="an_24:5">24:5</span> How beautiful are thy tabernacles, O
Jacob, and thy tents, O Israel!

<span id="an_24:6">24:6</span> As woody valleys, as watered gardens near
the rivers, as tabernacles which the Lord hath pitched, as cedars by the
waterside.

<span id="an_24:7">24:7</span> Water shall flow out of his bucket, and
his seed shall be in many waters. For Agag his king shall be removed,
and his kingdom shall be taken awry.

<span id="an_24:8">24:8</span> God hath brought him out of Egypt, whose
strength is like to the rhinoceros. They shall devour the nations that
are his enemies, and break their bones, and pierce them with arrows.

<span id="an_24:9">24:9</span> Lying down he hath slept as a lion, and
as a lioness, whom none shall dare to rouse. He that blesseth thee,
shall also himself be blessed: he that curseth thee shall be reckoned
accursed.

<span id="an_24:10">24:10</span> And Balac being angry against Balaam,
clapped his hands together and said: I called thee to curse my enemies,
and thou on the contrary hast blessed them three times.

<span id="an_24:11">24:11</span> Return to thy place. I had determined
indeed greatly to honour thee, but the Lord hath deprived thee of the
honour designed for thee.

<span id="an_24:12">24:12</span> Balaam made answer to Balac: Did I not
say to thy messengers, whom thou sentest to me:

<span id="an_24:13">24:13</span> If Balac would give me his house full
of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the word of the Lord my God, to
utter any thing of my own head either good or evil: but whatsoever the
Lord shall say, that I will speak?

<span id="an_24:14">24:14</span> But yet going to my people, I will give
thee counsel, what this people shall do to thy people in the latter
days.

<span id="an_24:15">24:15</span> Therefore taking up his parable, again
he said: Balaam the son of Beor hath said: The man whose eye is stopped
up, hath said:

<span id="an_24:16">24:16</span> The hearer of the words of God hath
said, who knoweth the doctrine of the Highest, and seeth the visions of
the Almighty, who falling hath his eyes opened:

<span id="an_24:17">24:17</span> I shall see him, but not now: I shall
behold him, but not near. A STAR SHALL RISE out of Jacob and a sceptre
shall spring up from Israel: and shall strike the chiefs of Moab, and
shall waste all the children of Seth.

<span id="an_24:18">24:18</span> And he shall possess Idumea: the
inheritance of Seir shall come to their enemies, but Israel shall do
manfully

<span id="an_24:19">24:19</span> Out of Jacob shall he come that shall
rule, and shall destroy the remains of the city.

<span id="an_24:20">24:20</span> And when he saw Amalec, he took up his
parable, and said: Amalec the beginning of nations, whose latter ends
shall be destroyed.

<span id="an_24:21">24:21</span> He saw also the Cinite: and took up his
parable, and said: Thy habitation in- deed is strong: but though thou
build thy nest in a rock,

<span id="an_24:22">24:22</span> And thou be chosen of the stock of Cin,
how long shalt thou be able to continue? For Assur shall take thee
captive.

<span id="an_24:23">24:23</span> And taking up his parable, again he
said: Alas, who shall live when God shall do these things?

<span id="an_24:24">24:24</span> They shall come in galleys from Italy,
they shall overcome the Assyrians, and shall waste the Hebrews, and at
the last they themselves also shall perish.

<span id="an_24:25">24:25</span> And Balaam rose, and returned to his
place: Balac also returned the way that he came.

<span id="an_25:1">25:1</span> And Israel at that time abode in Settim,
and the people committed fornication with the daughters of Moab,

<span id="an_25:2">25:2</span> Who called them to their sacrifices. And
they ate of them, and adored their gods.

<span id="an_25:3">25:3</span> And Israel was initiated to Beelphegor:
upon which the Lord being angry,

<span id="an_25:4">25:4</span> Said to Moses: Take all the princes of
the people, and hang them up on gibbets against the sun: that my fury
may be turned away from Israel.

<span id="an_25:5">25:5</span> And Moses said to the judges of Israel:
Let every man kill his neighbours, that have been initiated to
Beelphegor.

<span id="an_25:6">25:6</span> And behold one of the children of Israel
went in before his brethren to a harlot of Madian, in the sight of
Moses, and of all the children of Israel, who were weeping before the
door of the tabernacle.

<span id="an_25:7">25:7</span> And when Phinees the son of Eleazar the
son of Aaron the priest saw it, he rose up from the midst; of the
multitude, and taking a dagger,

<span id="an_25:8">25:8</span> Went in after the Israelite into the
brothel house, and thrust both of them through together, to wit, the man
and the woman in the genital parts. And the scourge ceased from the
children of Israel:

<span id="an_25:9">25:9</span> And there were slain four and twenty
thousand men.

<span id="an_25:10">25:10</span> And the Lord said to Moses:

<span id="an_25:11">25:11</span> Phinees the son of Eleazar the son of
Aaron the priest, hath turned away my wrath from the children of Israel:
because he was moved with my zeal against them, that I myself might not
destroy the children of Israel in my zeal.

<span id="an_25:12">25:12</span> Therefore say to him: Behold I give him
the peace of my covenant,

<span id="an_25:13">25:13</span> And the covenant of the priesthood for
ever shall be both to him and his seed, because he hath been zealous for
his God, and hath made atonement for the wickedness of the children of
Israel.

<span id="an_25:14">25:14</span> And the name of the Israelite, was
slain with the woman of Madian, was Zambri the son of Salu, a prince the
kindred and tribe of Simeon.

<span id="an_25:15">25:15</span> And the Madianite woman, that was slain
with him, was called Cozbi the daughter of Sur, a most noble prince
among the Madianites.

<span id="an_25:16">25:16</span> And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:

<span id="an_25:17">25:17</span> Let the Madianites find you enemies,
and slay you them:

<span id="an_25:18">25:18</span> Because they also have acted like
enemies against you, and have guilefully deceived you by the idol
Phogor, and Cozbi their sister, a daughter of a prince of Madian, who
was slain in the day the plague for the sacrilege of Phogor.

<span id="an_26:1">26:1</span> After the blood of the guilty was shed,
the Lord said to Moses and to Eleazar the son of Aaron, the priest:

<span id="an_26:2">26:2</span> Number the whole sum of the children of
Israel from twenty years old and upward, by their houses and kindreds,
all that are able to go forth to war.

<span id="an_26:3">26:3</span> Moses therefore and Eleazar the priest,
being in the plains of Moab upon the Jordan over against Jericho, spoke
to them that were

<span id="an_26:4">26:4</span> From twenty years old and upward, as the
Lord had commanded: and this is the number of them:

<span id="an_26:5">26:5</span> Ruben the firstborn of Israel. His sons
were Henoch, of whom is the family of the Henochites: and Phallu, of
whom is the family of the Phalluites:

<span id="an_26:6">26:6</span> And Hesron, of whom is the family of the
Hesronites: and Charmi, of whom is the family of the Charmites.

<span id="an_26:7">26:7</span> These are the families of the stock of
Ruben: whose number was found to be forty-three thousand seven hundred
and thirty.

<span id="an_26:8">26:8</span> The son of Phallu was Eliab.

<span id="an_26:9">26:9</span> His sons, were Namuel and Dathan and
Abiron. These are Dathan and Abiron the princes of the people, that rose
against Moses and Aaron in the sedition of Core, when they rebelled
against the Lord:

<span id="an_26:10">26:10</span> And the earth opening her mouth
swallowed up Core, many others dying, when the fire burned two hundred
and fifty men. And there was a great miracle wrought,

<span id="an_26:11">26:11</span> That when Core perished, his sons did
not perish.

<span id="an_26:12">26:12</span> The sons of Simeon by their kindreds:
Namuel, of him is the family of the Namuelites: Jamin, of him is the

Zarites: Saul, of him is the family of the Saulites.

<span id="an_26:14">26:14</span> These are the families of the stock of
Simeon, of which the whole number was twenty-two thousand two hundred.

<span id="an_26:17">26:17</span> Arod, of him is the family of the
Arodites: Ariel, of him is the family of the Arielites.

<span id="an_26:18">26:18</span> These are the families of Gad, of which
the whole number was forty thousand five hundred.

<span id="an_26:19">26:19</span> The sons of Juda, Her and Onan, who
both died in the land of Chanaan.

<span id="an_26:20">26:20</span> And the sons of Juda by their kindreds
were: Sela, of whom is the family of the Selaites: Phares, of whom is
the family of the Pharesites: Zare, of whom is the family of the
Zarites.

<span id="an_26:21">26:21</span> Moreover the sons of Phares were:
Hesron, of whom is the family of the Hesronites: and Hamul, of whom is
the family of the Hamulites.

<span id="an_26:22">26:22</span> These are the families of Juda, of
which the whole number was seventy-six thousand five hundred.

kindreds: Thola, of whom is the family of the Tholaites: Phua, of whom

<span id="an_26:25">26:25</span> These are the kindreds of Issachar,
whose number was sixty-four thousand three hundred.

hundred and thirty.

<span id="an_26:52">26:52</span> And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:

<span id="an_26:53">26:53</span> To these shall the land be divided for
their possessions according to the number of names.

<span id="an_26:54">26:54</span> To the greater number thou shalt give a
greater portion, and to the fewer a less: to every one, as they have now
been reckoned up, shall a possession be delivered :

<span id="an_26:55">26:55</span> Yet so that by lot the land be divided
to the tribe and families.

<span id="an_26:56">26:56</span> Whatsoever shall fall by lot, that
shall be taken by the more, or the fewer.

of Musi, the family of Core. Now Caath beget Amram :

<span id="an_26:59">26:59</span> Who had to wife Jochabed the daughter
of Levi, who was horn to him in Egypt. She bore to her husband Amram
sons, Aaron and Moses, and Mary their sister.

<span id="an_26:60">26:60</span> Of Aaron were born Nadab and Abiu, and
Eleazar and Ithamar:

<span id="an_26:61">26:61</span> Of whom Nadab and Abiu died, when they
had offered the strange fire before the Lord.

<span id="an_26:62">26:62</span> And all that were numbered, were
twenty-three thousand males from one month old and upward: for they were
not reckoned up among the children of Israel, neither was a possession
given to them with the rest.

<span id="an_26:63">26:63</span> This is the number of the children of
Israel, that were enrolled by Moses and Eleazar the priest, in the
plains of Moab upon the Jordan, over against Jericho.

<span id="an_26:64">26:64</span> Among whom there was not one of them
that were numbered before by Moses and Aaron in the desert of Sinai.

<span id="an_26:65">26:65</span> For the Lord had foretold that they
should die in the wilderness. And none remained of them, but Caleb the
son of Jephone, and Josue the son of Nun.

<span id="an_27:1">27:1</span> Then came the daughters of Salphaad, the
son of Hepher, the son of Galaad, the son of Machir, the son of
Manasses, who was the son of Joseph: and their names are Maala, and Noa,
and Hegla, and Melcha, and Thersa.

<span id="an_27:2">27:2</span> And they stood before Moses and Eleazar
the priest, and all the princes of the people at the door of the
tabernacle of the covenant, and said:

<span id="an_27:3">27:3</span> Our father died in the desert, and was
not in the sedition, that was raised against the Lord under Core, but he
died in his own sin: and he had no male children. Why is his name taken
away out of his family, because he had no son? Give us a possession
among the kinsmen of our father.

<span id="an_27:4">27:4</span> And Moses referred their cause to the
judgment of the Lord.

<span id="an_27:5">27:5</span> And the Lord said to him:

<span id="an_27:6">27:6</span> The daughters of Salphaad demand a just
thing : Give them a possession among their father's kindred, and let
them succeed him in his inheritance.

<span id="an_27:7">27:7</span> And to the children of Israel thou shalt
speak these things:

<span id="an_27:8">27:8</span> When a man dieth without a son, his
inheritance shall pass to his daughter.

<span id="an_27:9">27:9</span> If he have no daughter, his brethren
shall succeed him.

<span id="an_27:10">27:10</span> And if he have no brethren, you shall
give the inheritance to his father's brethren.

<span id="an_27:11">27:11</span> But if he have no uncles by the father,
the inheritance shall be given to them that are the next akin. And this
shall be to the children of Israel sacred by a perpetual law, as the
Lord hath commanded Moses.

<span id="an_27:12">27:12</span> The Lord also said to Moses: Go up into
this mountain Abarim, and view from thence the land which I will give to
the children of Israel.

<span id="an_27:13">27:13</span> And when thou shalt have seen it, thou
also shalt go to thy people, as thy brother Aaron is gone:

<span id="an_27:14">27:14</span> Because you offended me in the desert
of Sin in the contradiction of the multitude, neither would you sanctify
me before them at the waters. These are the waters of contradiction in
Cades of the desert of Sin.

<span id="an_27:15">27:15</span> And Moses answered him:

<span id="an_27:16">27:16</span> May the Lord the God of the spirits of
all flesh provide a man, that may be over this multitude:

<span id="an_27:17">27:17</span> And may go out and in before them, and
may lead them out, or bring them in: lest the people of the Lord be as
sheep without a shepherd.

<span id="an_27:18">27:18</span> And the Lord said to him: Take Josue
the son of Nun, a man in whom is the Spirit, and put thy hand upon him.

<span id="an_27:19">27:19</span> And he shall stand before Eleazar the
priest and all the multitude:

<span id="an_27:20">27:20</span> And thou shalt give him precepts in the
sight of all, and part of thy glory, that all the congregation of the
children of Israel may hear him.

<span id="an_27:21">27:21</span> If any thing be to be done, Eleazar the
priest shall consult the Lord for him. He and all the children of Israel
with him, and the rest of the multitude shall go out and go in at his
word.

<span id="an_27:22">27:22</span> Moses did as the Lord had commanded.
And when he had taken Josue, he set him before Eleazar the priest, and
all the assembly of the people,

<span id="an_27:23">27:23</span> And laying his hands on his head, he
repeated all things that the Lord had commanded.

<span id="an_28:1">28:1</span> The Lord also said to Moses:

<span id="an_28:2">28:2</span> Command the children of Israel, and thou
shalt say to them: Offer ye my oblation and my bread, and burnt
sacrifice of most sweet odour, in their due seasons.

<span id="an_28:3">28:3</span> These are the sacrifices which you shall
offer: Two lambs of a year old without blemish every day for the
perpetual holocaust:

<span id="an_28:4">28:4</span> One you shall offer in the morning, and
the other in the evening:

<span id="an_28:5">28:5</span> And the tenth part of an ephi of flour,
which shall be tempered with the purest oil, of the measure of the
fourth part of a hin.

<span id="an_28:6">28:6</span> It is the continual holocaust which you
offered in mount Sinai for a most sweet. odour of a sacrifice by fire to
the Lord.

<span id="an_28:7">28:7</span> And for a libation you shall offer of
wine the fourth part of a hin for every lamb in the sanctuary of the
Lord.

<span id="an_28:8">28:8</span> And you shall offer the other lamb in
like manner ill the evening according to all the rites of the morning
sacrifice, and of the libations thereof, an oblation of most sweet odour
to the Lord.

<span id="an_28:9">28:9</span> And on the sabbath day you shall offer
two lambs of a year old without blemish, and two tenths of flour
tempered with oil in sacrifice, and the libations,

<span id="an_28:10">28:10</span> Which regularly are poured out every
sabbath for the perpetual holocaust.

<span id="an_28:11">28:11</span> And on the first day of the month you

<span id="an_28:12">28:12</span> And three tenths of flour tempered with
oil in sacrifice for every calf: and two tenths of flour tempered with
oil for every ram:

tempered with oil in sacrifice for every lamb. It is a holocaust of most
sweet odour and an offering by fire to the Lord.

<span id="an_28:14">28:14</span> And these shall be the libations of
wine that are to be poured out for every victim: Half a hin for every
calf, a third for a ram, and a fourth for a lamb. This shall be the
holocaust for every month, as they succeed one another in the course of
the year.

<span id="an_28:15">28:15</span> A buck goat also shall be offered to

<span id="an_30:1">30:1</span> And Moses told the children of Israel all
that the Lord had commanded him :

<span id="an_30:2">30:2</span> And he said to the princes of the tribes
of the children of Israel: This is the word that the Lord hath
commanded:

<span id="an_30:3">30:3</span> If any man make a vow to the Lord, or
bind himself by an oath: he shall not make his word void but shall
fulfil all that he promised.

<span id="an_30:4">30:4</span> If a woman vow any thing, and bind
herself by an oath, being in her father's house, and but yet a girl in
age: if her father knew the vow that she hath promised, and the oath
wherewith she hath bound her soul, and held his peace, she shall be
bound by the vow:

<span id="an_30:5">30:5</span> Whatsoever she promised and swore, she
shall fulfil in deed.

<span id="an_30:6">30:6</span> But if her father, immediately as soon as
he heard it, gainsaid it, both her vows and her oaths shall be void,
neither shall she be bound to what she promised, because her father hath
gainsaid it.

<span id="an_30:7">30:7</span> If she have a husband, and shall vow any
thing, and the word once going out of her mouth shall bind her soul by
an oath:

<span id="an_30:8">30:8</span> The day that her husband shall hear it,
and not gainsay it, she shall be bound to the vow, and shall give
whatsoever she promised.

<span id="an_30:9">30:9</span> But if as soon as he heareth he gainsay
it, and make her promises and the words wherewith she had bound her soul
of no effect : the Lord will forgive her.

<span id="an_30:10">30:10</span> The widow, and she that is divorced,
shall fulfil whatsoever they vow.

<span id="an_30:11">30:11</span> If the wife in the house of her
husband, hath bound herself by vow and by oath,

<span id="an_30:12">30:12</span> If her husband hear, and hold his
peace, and doth not disallow the promise, she shall accomplish
whatsoever she had promised.

<span id="an_30:13">30:13</span> But if forthwith he gainsay it, she
shall not be bound by the promise: because her husband gainsaid it, and
the Lord will be merciful to her.

<span id="an_30:14">30:14</span> If she vow and bind herself by oath, to
afflict her soul by fasting, or abstinence from other things, it shall
depend on the will of her husband, whether she shall do it, or not do
it.

<span id="an_30:15">30:15</span> But if the husband hearing it hold his
peace, and defer the declaring his mind till another day: whatsoever she
had vowed and promised, she shall fulfil: because immediately as he
heard it, he held his peace.

<span id="an_30:16">30:16</span> But if he gainsay it after that he knew
it, he shall bear her iniquity.

<span id="an_30:17">30:17</span> These are the laws which the Lord
appointed to Moses between the husband and the wife, between the father
and the daughter that is as yet but a girl in age, or that abideth in
her father's house.

<span id="an_31:1">31:1</span> And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:

<span id="an_31:2">31:2</span> Revenge first the children of Israel on
the Madianites, and so thou shalt be gathered to thy people.

<span id="an_31:3">31:3</span> And Moses forthwith said: Arm of you men
to fight, who may take the revenge of the Lord on the Madianites.

<span id="an_31:4">31:4</span> Let a thousand men be chosen out of every
tribe of Israel to be sent to the war.

<span id="an_31:5">31:5</span> And they gave a thousand of every tribe,
that is to say, twelve thousand men well appointed for battle.

<span id="an_31:6">31:6</span> And Moses sent them with Phinees the son
of Eleazar the priest, and he delivered to him the holy vessels, and the
trumpets to sound.

<span id="an_31:7">31:7</span> And when they had fought against the
Madianites and had overcome them, they slew all the men.

<span id="an_31:8">31:8</span> And their kings Evi, and Recem, and Sur,
and Hur, and Rebe, five princes of the nation: Balaam also the son of
Beer they killed with the sword.

<span id="an_31:9">31:9</span> And they took their women, and their
children captives, and all their cattle, and all their goods: and all
their possessions they plundered:

<span id="an_31:10">31:10</span> And all their cities, and their
villages, and castles, they burned.

<span id="an_31:11">31:11</span> And they carried away the booty, and
all that they had taken both of men and of beasts.

<span id="an_31:12">31:12</span> And they brought them to Moses, and
Eleazar the priest, and to all the multitude of the children of Israel.
But the rest of the things for use they carried to the camp on the
plains of Moab, beside the Jordan over against Jericho.

<span id="an_31:13">31:13</span> And Moses and Eleazar the priest and
all the princes of the synagogue went forth to meet them without the
camp.

<span id="an_31:14">31:14</span> And Moses being angry with the chief
officers of the army, the tribunes, and the centurions that were come
from the battle,

<span id="an_31:15">31:15</span> Said: Why have you saved the women?

<span id="an_31:16">31:16</span> Are not these they, that deceived the
children of Israel by the counsel of Balaam, and made you transgress
against the Lord by the sin of Phogor, for which also the people was
punished?

<span id="an_31:17">31:17</span> Therefore kill all that are of the male
sex, even of the children: and put to death the women, that have
carnally known men.

<span id="an_31:18">31:18</span> But the girls, and all the women that
are virgins save for yourselves:

<span id="an_31:19">31:19</span> And stay without the camp seven days.
He that hath killed a man, or touched one that is killed, shall be
purified the third day and the seventh day.

<span id="an_31:20">31:20</span> And of all the spoil, every garment, or
vessel, or any thing made for use, of the skins, or hair of goats, or of
wood, shall be purified.

<span id="an_31:21">31:21</span> Eleazar also the priest spoke to the
men of the army, that had fought, in this manner: This is the ordinance
of the law, which the Lord hath commanded Moses:

<span id="an_31:22">31:22</span> Gold, and silver, and brass, and iron,
and lend, and tin,

<span id="an_31:23">31:23</span> And all that may pass through the fire,
shall be purified by fire, but whatsoever cannot abide the fire, shall
be sanctified with the water of expiation:

<span id="an_31:24">31:24</span> And you shall wash your garments the
seventh day, and being purified, you shall afterwards enter into the
camp.

<span id="an_31:25">31:25</span> And the Lord said to Moses:

<span id="an_31:26">31:26</span> Take the sum of the things that were
taken both of man and beast, thou and Eleazar the priest and the princes
of the multitude:

<span id="an_31:27">31:27</span> And thou shalt divide the spoil
equally, between them that fought and went out to the war, and between
the rest of the multitude.

<span id="an_31:28">31:28</span> And thou shalt separate a portion to
the Lord from them that fought and were in the battle, one soul of five
hundred as well of persons as of oxen and asses and sheep.

<span id="an_31:29">31:29</span> And thou shalt give it to Eleazar the
priest, because they are the firstfruits of the Lord.

<span id="an_31:30">31:30</span> Out of the moiety also of the children
of Israel thou shalt take the fiftieth head of persons, and of oxen, and
asses, and sheep, and of all beasts, and thou shalt give them to the
Levites that watch in the charge of the tabernacle of the Lord.

<span id="an_31:31">31:31</span> And Moses and Eleazar did as the Lord
had commanded.

<span id="an_31:32">31:32</span> And the spoil which the army had taken,
was six hundred seventy-five thousand sheep,

<span id="an_31:33">31:33</span> Seventy-two thousand oxen,

<span id="an_31:34">31:34</span> Sixty-one thousand asses:

<span id="an_31:35">31:35</span> And thirty-two thousand persons of the
female sex, that had not known men.

<span id="an_31:36">31:36</span> And one half was given to them that had
been in the battle, to wit, three hundred thirty-seven thousand five
hundred sheep:

<span id="an_31:37">31:37</span> Out of which, for the portion of the
Lord, were reckoned six hundred seventy-five sheep.

<span id="an_31:38">31:38</span> And out of the thirty-six thousand
oxen, seventy-two oxen:

<span id="an_31:39">31:39</span> Out of the thirty thousand five hundred
asses, sixty-one asses:

<span id="an_31:40">31:40</span> Out of the sixteen thousand persons,
there fell to the portion of the Lord, thirty-two souls.

<span id="an_31:41">31:41</span> And Moses delivered the number of the
firstfruits of the Lord to Eleazar the priest, as had been commanded
him,

<span id="an_31:42">31:42</span> Out of the half of the children of
Israel, which he had separated for them that had been in the battle.

<span id="an_31:43">31:43</span> But out of the half that fell to the
rest of the multitude, that is to say, out of the three hundred
thirty-seven thousand five hundred sheep,

<span id="an_31:44">31:44</span> And out of the thirty-six thousand
oxen,

<span id="an_31:45">31:45</span> And out of the thirty thousand five
hundred asses,

<span id="an_31:46">31:46</span> And out of the sixteen thousand
persons,

<span id="an_31:47">31:47</span> Moses took the fiftieth head, and gave
it to the Levites that watched in the tabernacle of the Lord, as the
Lord had commanded.

<span id="an_31:48">31:48</span> And when the commanders of the army,
and the tribunes and centurions were come to Moses, they said:

<span id="an_31:49">31:49</span> We thy servants have reckoned up the
number of the fighting men, whom we had under our hand, and not so much
as one was wanting.

<span id="an_31:50">31:50</span> Therefore we offer as gifts to the Lord
what gold every one of us could find in the booty, in garters and
tablets, rings and bracelets, and chains, that thou mayst pray to the
Lord for us.

<span id="an_31:51">31:51</span> And Moses and Eleazar the priest
received all the gold in divers kinds,

<span id="an_31:52">31:52</span> In weight sixteen thousand seven
hundred and fifty sicles, from the tribunes and from the centurions.

<span id="an_31:53">31:53</span> For that which every one had taken in
the booty was his own.

<span id="an_31:54">31:54</span> And that which was received they
brought into the tabernacle of the testimony, for a memorial of the
children of Israel before the Lord.

<span id="an_32:1">32:1</span> And the sons of Ruben and Gad had many
flocks of cattle, and their substance in beasts was infinite. And when
they saw the lands of Jazer and Galaad fit for feeding cattle,

<span id="an_32:2">32:2</span> They came to Moses and Eleazar the
priest, and the princes of the multitude, and said:

<span id="an_32:3">32:3</span> Ataroth, and Dibon, and Jazer, and Nemra,
Hesebon, and Eleale, and Saban, and Nebo, and Beon,

<span id="an_32:4">32:4</span> The land, which the Lord hath conquered
in the sight of the children of Israel, is a very fertile soil for the
feeding of beasts: and we thy servants have very much cattle:

<span id="an_32:5">32:5</span> And we pray thee, if we have found favour
in thy sight, that thou give it to us thy servants in possession, and
make us not pass over the Jordan.

<span id="an_32:6">32:6</span> And Moses answered them: What, shall your
brethren go to fight, and will you sit here?

<span id="an_32:7">32:7</span> Why do ye overturn the minds of the
children of Israel, that they may not dare to pass into the place which
the Lord hath given them?

<span id="an_32:8">32:8</span> Was it not thus your fathers did, when I
sent from Cadesbarne to view the land?

<span id="an_32:9">32:9</span> And when they were come as far as the
valley of the cluster, having viewed all the country, they overturned
the hearts of the children of Israel, that they should not enter into
the coasts, which the Lord gave them.

<span id="an_32:10">32:10</span> And he swore in his anger, saying:.

<span id="an_32:11">32:11</span> If these men, that came up out of
Egypt, from twenty years old and upward, shall see the land, which I
promised with an oath to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob: because they would
not follow me,

<span id="an_32:12">32:12</span> Except Caleb the son of Jephone the
Cenezite, and Josue the son of Nun: these have fulfilled my will.

<span id="an_32:13">32:13</span> And the Lord being angry against
Israel, led them about through the desert forty years, until the whole
generation, that had done evil in his sight, was consumed.

<span id="an_32:14">32:14</span> And behold, said he, you are risen up
instead of your fathers, the increase and offspring of sinful men, to
augment the fury of the Lord against Israel.

<span id="an_32:15">32:15</span> For if you will not follow him, he will
leave the people in the wilderness, end you shall be the cause of the
destruction of all.

<span id="an_32:16">32:16</span> But they coming near, said: We will
make sheepfolds, and stalls for our cattle, and strong cities for our
children :

<span id="an_32:17">32:17</span> And we ourselves will go armed and
ready for battle before the children of Israel, until we bring them in
unto their places. Our little ones, and all we have, shall be in walled
cities, for fear of the ambushes of the inhabitants.

<span id="an_32:18">32:18</span> We will not return into our houses
until the children of Israel possess their inheritance:

<span id="an_32:19">32:19</span> Neither will we seek any thing beyond
the Jordan, because we have already our possession on the east side
thereof,

<span id="an_32:20">32:20</span> And Moses said to them: If you do what
you promise, go on well appointed for war before the Lord:

<span id="an_32:21">32:21</span> And let every fighting man pass over
the Jordan, until the Lord overthrow his enemies :

<span id="an_32:22">32:22</span> And all the land be brought under him,
then shall you be blameless before the Lord and before Israel, and you
shall obtain the countries that you desire, before the Lord.

<span id="an_32:23">32:23</span> But if you do not what you say, no man
can doubt but you sin against God: and know ye, that your sin shall
overtake you.

<span id="an_32:24">32:24</span> Build therefore cities for your
children, and folds and stalls for your sheep and beasts, and accomplish
what you have promised.

<span id="an_32:25">32:25</span> And the children of Gad and Ruben said
to Moses: We are thy servants, we will do what my lord commandeth.

<span id="an_32:26">32:26</span> We will leave our children, and our
wives and sheep and cattle, in the cities of Galaad:

<span id="an_32:27">32:27</span> And we thy servants all well appointed
will march on to the war, as thou, my lord, speakest.

<span id="an_32:28">32:28</span> Moses therefore commanded Eleazar the
priest, and Josue the son of Nun, and the princes of the families of all
the tribes of Israel, and said to them:

<span id="an_32:29">32:29</span> If the children of Gad, and the
children of Ruben pass with you over the Jordan, all armed for war
before the Lord, and the land be made subject to you: give them Galaad
in possession.

<span id="an_32:30">32:30</span> But if they will not pass armed with
you into the land of Chanaan, let them receive places to dwell in among
you.

<span id="an_32:31">32:31</span> And the children of Gad, and the
children of Ruben answered: As the Lord hath spoken to his servants, so
will we do:

<span id="an_32:32">32:32</span> We will go armed before the Lord into
the land of Chanaan, and we confess that we have already received our
possession beyond the Jordan.

<span id="an_32:33">32:33</span> Moses therefore gave to the children of
Cad and of Ruben, and to the half tribe of Manasses the son of Joseph,
the kingdom of Sehon king of the Amorrhites, and the kingdom of Og king
of Basan, and their land and the cities thereof round about.

<span id="an_32:34">32:34</span> And the sons of Cad built Dibon, and
Ataroth, and Aroer,

<span id="an_32:35">32:35</span> And Etroth, and Sophan, and Jazer, and
Jegbaa,

<span id="an_32:36">32:36</span> And Bethnemra, and Betharan, fenced
cities, and folds for their cattle.

<span id="an_32:37">32:37</span> But the children of Ruben built
Hesebon, and Eleale, and Cariathaim,

<span id="an_32:38">32:38</span> And Nabo, and Baalmeon (their names
being changed) and Sabama: giving names to the cities which they had
built.

<span id="an_32:39">32:39</span> Moreover the children of Machir, the
son of Manasses, went into Galaad, and wasted it, cutting off the
Amorrhites, the inhabitants thereof.

<span id="an_32:40">32:40</span> And Moses gave the land of Galaad to
Machir the son of Manasses, and he dwelt in it.

<span id="an_32:41">32:41</span> And Jair the son of Manasses went, and
took the villages thereof, and he called them Havoth Jair, that is to
say, the villages of Jair.

<span id="an_32:42">32:42</span> Nobe also went, and took Canath with
the villages thereof: and he called it by his own name, Nobe.

<span id="an_33:1">33:1</span> These are the mansions of the children of
Israel, who went out of Egypt by their troops under the conduct of Moses
and Aaron,

<span id="an_33:2">33:2</span> Which Moses wrote down according to the
places of their encamping, which they changed by the commandment of the
Lord.

<span id="an_33:3">33:3</span> Now the children of Israel departed from
Ramesses the first month, on the fifteenth day of the first month, the
day after the phase, with a mighty hand, in the eight of all the
Egyptians,

<span id="an_33:4">33:4</span> Who were burying their firstborn, whom
the Lord had slain (upon their gods also he had executed vengeance,)

<span id="an_33:5">33:5</span> And they camped in Soccoth.

<span id="an_33:6">33:6</span> And from Soccoth they came into Etham,
which is in the uttermost borders of the wilderness.

<span id="an_33:7">33:7</span> Departing from thence they came over
against Phihahiroth, which looketh towards Beelsephon, and they camped
before Magdalum.

<span id="an_33:8">33:8</span> And departing from Phihahiroth, they
passed through the midst of the sea into the wilderness: and having
marched three days through the desert of Etham, they camped in Mara.

<span id="an_33:9">33:9</span> And departing from Mara, they came into
Elim, where there were twelve fountains of waters, and seventy palm
trees: and there they camped.

<span id="an_33:10">33:10</span> But departing from thence also, they
pitched their tents by the Red Sea. And departing from the Red Sea,

<span id="an_33:11">33:11</span> They camped in the desert of Sin.

<span id="an_33:12">33:12</span> And they removed from thence, and came
to Daphca.

<span id="an_33:13">33:13</span> And departing from Daphca, they camped
in Alus.

<span id="an_33:14">33:14</span> And departing from Alus, they pitched
their tents in Raphidim, where the people wanted water to drink.

<span id="an_33:15">33:15</span> And departing from Raphidim, they
camped in the desert of Sinai.

<span id="an_33:16">33:16</span> But departing also from the desert of
Sinai, they came to the graves of lust.

<span id="an_33:17">33:17</span> And departing from the graves of lust,
they camped in Haseroth.

<span id="an_33:18">33:18</span> And from Haseroth they came to Rethma.

<span id="an_33:19">33:19</span> And departing from Rethma, they camped
in Remmomphares.

<span id="an_33:20">33:20</span> And they departed from thence and came
to Lebna.

<span id="an_33:21">33:21</span> Removing from Lebna they camped in
Ressa.

<span id="an_33:22">33:22</span> And departing from Ressa, they came to
Ceelatha.

<span id="an_33:23">33:23</span> And they removed from thence and camped
in the mountain Sepher.

<span id="an_33:24">33:24</span> Departing from the mountain Sepher,
they came to Arada.

<span id="an_33:25">33:25</span> From thence they went and camped in
Maceloth.

<span id="an_33:26">33:26</span> And departing from Maceloth, they came
to Thahath.

<span id="an_33:27">33:27</span> Removing from Thahath they camped in
Thare.

<span id="an_33:28">33:28</span> And they departed from thence, and
pitched their tents in Methca.

<span id="an_33:29">33:29</span> And removing from Methca, they camped
in Hesmona.

<span id="an_33:30">33:30</span> And departing from Hesmona, they came
to Moseroth.

<span id="an_33:31">33:31</span> And removing from Moseroth, they camped
in Benejaacan.

<span id="an_33:32">33:32</span> And departing from Benejaacan, they
came to mount Gadgad.

<span id="an_33:33">33:33</span> From thence they went and camped in
Jetebatha.

<span id="an_33:34">33:34</span> And from Jetebatha they came to
Hebrona.

<span id="an_33:35">33:35</span> And departing from Hebrona, they camped
in Asiongaber.

<span id="an_33:36">33:36</span> They removed from thence and came into
the desert of Sin, which is Cades.

<span id="an_33:37">33:37</span> And departing from Cades, they camped
in mount Her, in the uttermost borders of the land of Edom.

<span id="an_33:38">33:38</span> And Aaron the priest went up into mount
Hor at the commandment of the Lord: and there he died in the fortieth
year of the coming forth of the children of Israel out of Egypt, W the
fifth month, the first day of the month,

<span id="an_33:39">33:39</span> When he was a hundred and twenty-three
years old.

<span id="an_33:40">33:40</span> And king Arad the Chanaanite, who dwelt
towards the south, heard that the children of Israel were come to the
land of Chanaan.

<span id="an_33:41">33:41</span> And they departed from mount Her, and
camped in Salmona.

<span id="an_33:42">33:42</span> From whence they removed and came to
Phunon.

<span id="an_33:43">33:43</span> And departing from Phunon, they camped
in Oboth.

<span id="an_33:44">33:44</span> And from Oboth they came to Ijeabarim,
which is in the borders of the Moabites.

<span id="an_33:45">33:45</span> And departing from Ijeabarim they
pitched their tents in Dibongab.

<span id="an_33:46">33:46</span> From thence they went and camped in
Helmondeblathaim.

<span id="an_33:47">33:47</span> And departing from Helmondeblathaim,
they came to the mountains of Abarim over against Nabo.

<span id="an_33:48">33:48</span> And departing from the mountains of
Abarim, they passed to the plains of Moab, by the Jordan, over against
Jericho.

<span id="an_33:49">33:49</span> And there they camped from Bethsi moth
even to Ablesatim in the plains of the Moabites,

<span id="an_33:50">33:50</span> Where the Lord said to Moses:

<span id="an_33:51">33:51</span> Command the children of Israel, and say
to them: When you shall have passed over the Jordan, entering into the
land of Chanaan,

<span id="an_33:52">33:52</span> Destroy all the inhabitants of that
land: beat down their pillars, and break in pieces their statues, and
waste all their high places,

<span id="an_33:53">33:53</span> Cleansing the land, and dwelling in it.
For I have given it you for a possession.

<span id="an_33:54">33:54</span> And you shall divide it among you by
lot. To the more you shall give a larger part, and to the fewer a
lesser. To every one as the lot shall fall, so shall the inheritance be
given. The possession shall be divided by the tribes and the families.

<span id="an_33:55">33:55</span> But if you will not kill the
inhabitants of the land: they that remain, shall be unto you as nails in
your eyes, and spears in your sides, and they shall be your adversaries
in the land of your habitation.

<span id="an_33:56">33:56</span> And whatsoever I had thought to do to
them, I will do to you.

<span id="an_34:1">34:1</span> And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:

<span id="an_34:2">34:2</span> Command the children of Israel, and then
shalt say to them: When you are entered into the land of Chanaan, and it
shall be fallen into your possession by lot, it shall be bounded by
these limits:

<span id="an_34:3">34:3</span> The south side shall begin from the
wilderness of Sin, which is by Edom: and shall have the most salt sea
for its furthest limits eastward:

<span id="an_34:4">34:4</span> Which limits shall go round on the south
side by the ascent of the Scorpion and so into Senna, and reach toward
the south as far as Cadesbarne, from whence the frontiers shall go out
to the town called Adar, and shall reach as far as Asemona.

<span id="an_34:5">34:5</span> And the limits shall fetch a compass from
Asemona to the torrent of Egypt, and shall end in the shore of the great
sea.

<span id="an_34:6">34:6</span> And the west side shall begin from the
great sea, and the same shall be the end thereof.

<span id="an_34:7">34:7</span> But toward the north side the borders
shall begin from the great sea, reaching to the most high mountain,

<span id="an_34:8">34:8</span> From which they shall come to Emath, as
far as the borders of Sedada:

<span id="an_34:9">34:9</span> nod the limits shall go as far as
Zephrona, and the village of Enan. These shall be the borders on the
north side.

<span id="an_34:10">34:10</span> From thence they shall mark out the
bounds towards the east side from the village of Enan unto Sephama.

<span id="an_34:11">34:11</span> And from Sephama the bounds shall go
down to Rebla over against the fountain of Daphnis: from thence they
shall come eastward to the sea of Cenereth,

<span id="an_34:12">34:12</span> And shall reach as far as the Jordan,
and at the last shall be closed in by the most salt sea. This shall be
your land with its borders round about.

<span id="an_34:13">34:13</span> And Moses commanded the children of
Israel, saying: This shall be the land which you shall possess by lot,
and which the Lord hath commanded to be given to the nine tribes, and to
the half tribe.

<span id="an_34:14">34:14</span> For the tribe of the children of Ruben
by their families, and the tribe of the children of Gad according to the
number of their kindreds, and half of the tribe of Manasses,

<span id="an_34:15">34:15</span> That is, two tribes and a half, have
received their portion beyond the Jordan over against Jericho at the
east side.

<span id="an_34:16">34:16</span> And the Lord said to Moses:

<span id="an_34:17">34:17</span> These are the names of the men, that
shall divide the land unto you: Eleazar the priest, and Josue the son of
Nun,

<span id="an_34:18">34:18</span> And one prince of every tribe,

<span id="an_34:19">34:19</span> Whose names are these : Of the tribe of
Juda, Caleb the son of Jephone.

<span id="an_34:20">34:20</span> Of the tribe of Simeon, Samuel the son
of Ammiud.

<span id="an_34:21">34:21</span> Of the tribe of Benjamin, Elidad the
son of Chaselon.

<span id="an_34:22">34:22</span> Of the tribe of the children of Dan,
Bocci the son of Jogli.

<span id="an_34:23">34:23</span> Of the children of Joseph of the tribe
of Manasses, Hanniel the son of Ephod.

<span id="an_34:24">34:24</span> Of the tribe of Ephraim, Camuel the son
of Sephtan.

<span id="an_34:25">34:25</span> Of the tribe of Zabulon, Elisaphan the
son of Pharnach.

<span id="an_34:26">34:26</span> Of the tribe of Issachar, Phaltiel the
prince, the son of Ozan.

<span id="an_34:27">34:27</span> Of the tribe of Aser, Ahiud the son of
Salomi.

<span id="an_34:28">34:28</span> Of the tribe of Nephtali: Phedael the
son of Ammiud.

<span id="an_34:29">34:29</span> These are they whom the Lord hath
commanded to divide the land of Chanaan to the children of Israel,.

<span id="an_35:1">35:1</span> And the Lord spoke these things also to
Moses in the plains of Moab by the Jordan, over against Jericho:

<span id="an_35:2">35:2</span> Command the children of Israel that they
give to the Levites out of their possessions,

<span id="an_35:3">35:3</span> Cities to dwell in, and their suburbs
round about: that they may abide in the towns, and the suburbs may be
for their cattle and beasts:

<span id="an_35:4">35:4</span> Which suburbs shall reach from the walls
of the cities outward, a thousand paces on every side:

<span id="an_35:5">35:5</span> Toward the east shall be two thousand
cubits: and toward the south in like manner shall be two thousand
cubits: toward the sea also, which looketh to the west, shall be the
same extent: and the north side shall be bounded with the like limits.
And the cities shall be in the midst, and the suburbs without.

<span id="an_35:6">35:6</span> And among the cities, which you shall
give to the Levites, six shall be separated for refuge to fugitives,
that he who hath shed blood may flee to them: and besides these there
shall be other forty-two cities,

<span id="an_35:7">35:7</span> That is, in all forty-eight with their
suburbs.

<span id="an_35:8">35:8</span> And of these cities which shall be given
out of the possessions of the children of Israel, from them that have
more, more shall be taken: and from them that have less, fewer. Each
shall give towns to the Levites according to the extent of their
inheritance.

<span id="an_35:9">35:9</span> The Lord said to Moses:

<span id="an_35:10">35:10</span> Speak to the children of Israel, and
thou shalt say to them: When you shall have passed over the Jordan into
the land of Chanaan,

<span id="an_35:11">35:11</span> Determine what cities shall be for the
refuge of fugitives, who have shed blood against their will.

<span id="an_35:12">35:12</span> And when the fugitive shall be in them,
the kinsman of him that is slain may not have power to kill him, until
he stand before the multitude, and his cause be judged.

<span id="an_35:13">35:13</span> And of those cities, that are separated
for the refuge of fugitives,

<span id="an_35:14">35:14</span> Three shall be beyond the Jordan, and
three in the land of Chanaan,

<span id="an_35:15">35:15</span> As well for the children of Israel as
for strangers and sojourners, that he may flee to them, who hath shed
blood against his will.

<span id="an_35:16">35:16</span> If any man strike with iron, and he die
that was struck : he shall be guilty of murder, and he himself shall
die.

<span id="an_35:17">35:17</span> If he throw a stone, and he that is
struck die: he shall be punished in the same manner.

<span id="an_35:18">35:18</span> If he that is struck with wood die: he
shall be revenged by the blood of him that struck him.

<span id="an_35:19">35:19</span> The kinsman of him that was slain,
shall kill the murderer: as soon as he apprehendeth him, he shall kill
him.

<span id="an_35:20">35:20</span> If through hatred any one push a man,
or fling any thing- at him with ill design:

<span id="an_35:21">35:21</span> Or being his enemy, strike; him with
his hand, and he die: the striker shall be guilty of murder: the kinsman
of him that was slain as soon as he findeth him, shall kill him.

<span id="an_35:22">35:22</span> But if by chance medley, and without
hatred,

<span id="an_35:23">35:23</span> And enmity, he do any of these things,

<span id="an_35:24">35:24</span> And this be proved in the hearing of
the people, and the cause be debated between him that struck, and the
next of kin:

<span id="an_35:25">35:25</span> The innocent shall be delivered from
the hand of the revenger, and shall be brought back by sentence into the
city, to which he had fled, and he shall abide there until the death of
the high priest, that is anointed with the holy oil.

<span id="an_35:26">35:26</span> If the murderer be found without the
limits of the cities that are appointed for the banished,

<span id="an_35:27">35:27</span> And be struck by him that is the
avenger of blood: he shall not be guilty that killed him.

<span id="an_35:28">35:28</span> For the fugitive ought to have stayed
in the city until the death of the high priest: and after he is dead,
then shall the manslayer return to his own country.

<span id="an_35:29">35:29</span> These things shall be perpetual, and
for an ordinance in all your dwellings.

<span id="an_35:30">35:30</span> The murderer shall be punished by
witnesses: none shall be condemned upon the evidence of one man.

<span id="an_35:31">35:31</span> 31You shall not take money of him that
is guilty of blood, but he shall die forthwith.

<span id="an_35:32">35:32</span> The banished and fugitives before the
death of the high priest may by no means return into their own cities.

<span id="an_35:33">35:33</span> Defile not the land of your habitation,
which is stained with the blood of the innocent: neither can it
otherwise be expiated, but by his blood that hath shed the blood of
another.

<span id="an_35:34">35:34</span> And thus shall your possession he
cleansed, myself abiding with you. For I am the Lord that dwell among
the children of Israel.

<span id="an_36:1">36:1</span> And the princes of the families of
Galaad, the son of Machir, the son of Manasses, of the stock Of the
children of Joseph, came and spoke to Moses before the princes of
Israel, and said:

<span id="an_36:2">36:2</span> The Lord hath commanded thee, my lord,
that thou shouldst divide the land by lot to the children of Israel, and
that thou shouldst give to the daughters of Salphaad our brother the
possession due to their father:

<span id="an_36:3">36:3</span> Now if men of another tribe take them to
wives, their possession will follow them, and being transferred to
another tribe, will be a diminishing of our inheritance.

<span id="an_36:4">36:4</span> And so it shall come to pass, that when
the jubilee, that is, the fiftieth year of remission, is come, the
distribution made by the lots shall be confounded, and the possession of
the one shall pass to the others.

<span id="an_36:5">36:5</span> Moses answered the children of Israel,
and said by the command of the Lord: The tribe of the children of Joseph
hath spoken rightly.

<span id="an_36:6">36:6</span> And this is the law promulgated by the
Lord touching the daughters of Salphaad: Let them marry to whom they
will, only so that it be to men of their own tribe.

<span id="an_36:7">36:7</span> Lest the possession of the children of
Israel be mingled from tribe to tribe. For all men shall marry wives of
their own tribe and kindred:

<span id="an_36:8">36:8</span> And all women shall take husbands of the
same tribe: that the inheritance may remain in the families,

<span id="an_36:9">36:9</span> And that the tribes be not mingled one
with another, but remain so

<span id="an_36:10">36:10</span> As they were separated by the Lord. And
the daughters of Salphaad did as was commanded:

<span id="an_36:11">36:11</span> And Maala, and Thersa, and Hegla, and
Melcha, and Noa were married to the sons of their uncle by their father

<span id="an_36:12">36:12</span> Of the family of Manasses, who was the
son of Joseph: and the possession that had been allotted to them,
remained in the tribe and family of their father.

<span id="an_36:13">36:13</span> These are the commandments and
judgments, which the Lord commanded by the hand of Moses to the children
of Israel, in the plains of Moab upon the Jordan over against Jericho.
