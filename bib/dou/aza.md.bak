### Douay-Rheims Bible: Prayer of Azariah

<span id="an_1:1">1:1</span> And they walked in the midst of the flame,
praising God and blessing the Lord.

<span id="an_1:2">1:2</span> Then Azarias standing up prayed in this
manner, and opening his mouth in the midst of the fire, he said:

<span id="an_1:3">1:3</span> Blessed art thou, O Lord, the God of our
fathers, and thy name is worthy of praise, and glorious for ever:

<span id="an_1:4">1:4</span> For thou art just in all that thou hast
done to us, and all thy works are true, and thy ways right, and all thy
judgments true.

<span id="an_1:5">1:5</span> For thou hast executed true judgments in
all the things that thou hast brought upon us, and upon Jerusalem the
holy city of our fathers: for according to truth and judgment, thou hast
brought all these things upon us for our sins.

<span id="an_1:6">1:6</span> For we have sinned, and committed iniquity,
departing from thee: and we have trespassed in all things:

<span id="an_1:7">1:7</span> And we have not hearkened to thy
commandments, nor have we observed nor done as thou hadst commanded us,
that it might go well with us.

<span id="an_1:8">1:8</span> Wherefore all that thou hast brought upon
us, and every thing that thou hast done to us, thou hast done in true
judgment:

<span id="an_1:9">1:9</span> And thou hast delivered us into the hands
of our enemies that are unjust, and most wicked, and prevaricators, and
to a king unjust, and most wicked beyond all that axe upon the earth.

<span id="an_1:10">1:10</span> And now we cannot open our mouths: we are
become a shame and reproach to thy servants, and to them that worship
thee.

<span id="an_1:11">1:11</span> Deliver us not up for ever, we beseech
thee, for thy name's sake, and abolish not thy covenant.

<span id="an_1:12">1:12</span> And take not away thy mercy from us for
the sake of Abraham thy beloved, and Isaac thy servant, and Israel thy
holy one:

<span id="an_1:13">1:13</span> To whom thou hast spoken, promising that
thou wouldst multiply their seed as the stars of heaven, and as the sand
that is on the sea shore.

<span id="an_1:14">1:14</span> For we, O Lord, are diminished more than
any nation, and are brought low in all the earth this day for our sins.

<span id="an_1:15">1:15</span> Neither is there at this time prince, or
leader, or prophet, or holocaust, or sacrifice, or oblation, or incense,
or place of firstfruits before thee,

<span id="an_1:16">1:16</span> That we may find thy mercy: nevertheless
in a contrite heart and humble spirit let us be accepted.

<span id="an_1:17">1:17</span> As in holocausts of rams, and bullocks,
and as in thousands of fat lambs: so let our sacrifice be made in thy
sight this day, that it may please thee: for there is no confusion to
them that trust in thee.

<span id="an_1:18">1:18</span> And now we follow thee with all our
heart, and we fear thee, and seek thy face.

<span id="an_1:19">1:19</span> Put us not to confusion, but deal. with
us according to thy meekness, and according to the multitude of thy
mercies.

<span id="an_1:20">1:20</span> And deliver us according to thy wonderful
works, and give glory to thy name, O Lord:

<span id="an_1:21">1:21</span> And let all them be confounded that shew
evils to thy servants, let them be confounded in all thy might, and let
their strength be broken.

<span id="an_1:22">1:22</span> And let them know that thou art the Lord,
the only God, and glorious over all the world.

<span id="an_1:23">1:23</span> Now the king's servants that had cast
them in, ceased not to heat the furnace with brimstone, and tow, and
pitch, and dry sticks,

<span id="an_1:24">1:24</span> And the flame mounted up above the
furnace nine and forty cubits:

<span id="an_1:25">1:25</span> And it broke forth, and burnt such of the
Chaldeans as it found near the furnace.

<span id="an_1:26">1:26</span> But the angel of the Lord went down with
Azarias and his companions into the furnace: and he drove the flame of
the fire out of the furnace,

<span id="an_1:27">1:27</span> And made the midst of the furnace like
the blowing of a wind bringing dew, and the fire touched them not at
all, nor troubled them, nor did them any harm.

<span id="an_1:28">1:28</span> Then these three as with one mouth
praised, and glorified, and blessed God in the furnace, saying:

<span id="an_1:29">1:29</span> Blessed art thou, O Lord the God of our
fathers: and worthy to be praised, and glorified, and exalted above all
for ever: and blessed is the holy name of thy glory: and worthy to be
praised, and exalted above all in all ages.

<span id="an_1:30">1:30</span> Blessed art thou in the holy temple of
thy glory: and exceedingly to be praised, and exceeding glorious for
ever.

<span id="an_1:31">1:31</span> Blessed art thou on the throne of thy
kingdom, and exceedingly to be praised, and exalted above all for ever.

depths, and sittest upon the cherubims: and worthy to be praised and
exalted above all for ever.

heaven: and worthy of praise, and glorious for ever.
