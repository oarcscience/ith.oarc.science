### THREE

### The Conflict over Creed and Canon

THE CHRISTIANS of the first century A. D. lived in expectation of the
second coming of Christ, therefore they felt no need of a permanent
creed or sacred canon. As most of them were converted Jews, they
naturally accepted the Old Testament, known to those outside of
Palestine in the version of the Septuagint (completed in the first
century B.C.), but beyond that they had only such fragmentary Christian
writings as their particular congregations happened to possess.

When during the second century the hope of Christ's immediate return
gradually faded and the necessity of finding some definite body of
doctrine to hold the Christian communities together began to be
recognized, the difficulties in the way were almost insuperable. The
Christian congregations were scattered throughout the separate cities of
the Roman Empire. The enhancement of the value of the individual brought
by the Christian emphasis upon personal immortality, while it was one of
the main reasons for the rapid spread of the new religion,

<span id="page_60">p. 60</span>

was also a danger in that it tended to foster highly individualistic and
divergent interpretations of this new religion's meaning. Far greater
than the likelihood of its being crushed by the sporadic and inefficient
Roman persecutions was the possibility that Christianity would split up
into a number of mutually hostile sects.

To arrive at any settled system of dogma it was necessary to answer a
number of perplexing questions. Assuming that the Apostolic writings
could be separated from the pseudo-Apostolic imitations that now began
to appear in large numbers, were they to be considered as of greater,
equal, or lesser authority in comparison with the literature of the Old
Testament? To just what degree was the Mosaic law still binding upon
Christians? What was the true relation between the human and the divine
natures united in the Christ? And how answer the old question as to the
existence of evil in a world ruled by a perfect deity? Upon these
points, Christianity was time and again threatened with dissolution.

In contrast to paganism and to the rival Oriental religions, Mithraism
and Isis worship, Christianity had the immeasurable advantage of
possessing the imposing body of sacred scriptures in the Old

<span id="page_61">p. 61</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Testament. For a
time, however, it was doubtful whether this immense advantage would not
be thrown away at the outset. The Jews had rejected Jesus; the
temptation was strong for the Christians to retaliate by rejecting
everything Jewish. There was much in the Old Testament, particularly in
its early parts, which was thoroughly inconsistent with the teachings of
Jesus. Why retain the scriptures of a religion whose priests had brought
about the crucifixion of the Christ?

Thus the question of the inclusion of the Old Testament in the Christian
Bible was at the outset involved in the larger question as to the
meaning of Christian salvation—whether it was to be salvation in the
world or salvation from the world. On this issue the future of
Christianity turned: whether it should become a negative religion like
Buddhism or Zoroastrianism or should follow the more positive path laid
down by its founder. At the moment the forces making for the negative
and pessimistic interpretation were numerous and powerful. The Roman
Empire was full of Oriental cults practicing various forms of mystical
asceticism. Greek philosophy which in its palmy days would have offered
a defense was now tending downward in the same direction. Plato's
identification of evil

<span id="page_62">p. 62</span>

with matter was bearing dark fruit in an ever-increasing dualism between
the spirit and the body. Warred upon from right and left by the
sensuality of paganism and by the asceticism of its own extremists, it
took Christianity more than a century to find its way into the open.

The stoutest fighter for the preservation of Christianity as a
monotheistic religion was the mighty Origen (Origines Adamantius), the
chief Christian theologian of the third century and the first great
textual critic. Born in Alexandria, the son of a Christian martyr, he
was so precocious a student that at the age of eighteen he succeeded
Clement of Alexandria as head of the catechetical school. The most
prolific of writers, reputed author of six thousand works, he still
devoted twenty years to a study of the Scriptures which resulted in his
Hexapla, the first polyglot Bible, in which he arranged in six parallel
columns the Hebrew Old Testament, his own Greek transliteration of it,
the Septuagint, and three second-century Greek translations by Aquila,
Theodotion, and Symmachus. Although in his youth he had emasculated
himself in literal fulfillment of the supposed commandment of Christ in
Matthew xix. 12, he was not a literalist in his general interpretation
of the

<span id="page_63">p. 63</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Bible. The
Scriptures, he held, should be read in three ways: as a record of facts,
as a moral allegory, and as religious symbolism.

By the end of the third century, the danger that Christianity might
abandon the Old Testament definitely passed. There had also by this time
come to be accepted the nucleus of a canonical New Testament, consisting
of the four Gospels and the Pauline Epistles. But the final status of
the other New Testament works was still undetermined, as well as that of
various Christian apocryphal writings. Out of a mass of early Christian
"gospels" and "epistles," most of which were of little worth, several
works possessed survival value, the *Epistle of Barnabas*, the *Epistle
of Clement of Rome*, the *Shepherd of Hermas*, and the *Apocalypse of
Peter*. Two second-century works were also very highly esteemed: the
*Testament of Our Lord*, which professed to be the very "testament or
words which Our Lord spake to His Holy Apostles when He rose from the
dead," and the *Apostolic Constitutions*, a collection of eight books
ostensibly recording the words of the Apostles as written down by
Clement of Alexandria. Popularly attributed to the Apostles also was the
anonymous Apostles’ Creed, which in practically its later form already
circulated during the second

<span id="page_64">p. 64</span>

century. This creed, however, did not attempt to define the precise
relations between the Father and the Son, much less to explain the
nature of the Trinity. Such creedal formulation, as well as the precise
limitation of the canon, did not come until the establishment of
Christianity as the religion of the Roman Empire accomplished a more
definite unification of divergent tendencies and doctrines.

This occurred in the early part of the fourth century after Constantine
the Great had been led to favor Christianity because, according to the
accepted legend, Just before the decisive battle which made him emperor
he saw in the sky a miraculous cross bearing the words in Greek, "By
this, conquer." When Constantine chose Byzantium, renamed
Constantinople, as the capital of the Empire, he presented the churches
of the city with fifty magnificent copies of the Bible prepared at his
expense.

A new heresy led to the formulation of a new creed. In Antioch the
presbyter Lucian had been preaching strange doctrine, namely that
Christ, since he had been created by the Father, could not be held equal
to the Father. He was the first created of beings, created before all
worlds, but he could not be considered coeternal with the Father without
violating all logic. One of Lucian's pupils, the

<span id="page_65">p. 65</span>

presbyter Arius, taught the same doctrine in Alexandria where he was
indignantly answered by another Alexandrian cleric, Athanasius. The
bishop of Alexandria, after some hesitation, supported the latter, but
Arius found an almost equally powerful adherent in another of Lucian's
pupils, Eusebius, who had become bishop of Nicomedia. The quarrel spread
from church to church; bishop anathematized bishop; the dispute at last
became so scandalous that in 325 Constantine, in order to bring peace to
the warring clergy, called the first ecumenical council at Nicaea in
Asia Minor.

It was probably the most important gathering in the whole history of
Christianity, for its decision would determine the official creed of the
Christian Church for centuries to come. Arianism was a first faint
beginning of what would today be called a Unitarian conception of
Christianity; the Athanasians, on the other hand, were the stoutest of
Trinitarians. The issue was decided neither by reason nor by the
authority of the Scriptures, but by the relative strength of the
contending parties. The Nicene Council resembled a truce between hostile
armies rather than a peaceful convocation; both sides came armed, and
physical conflict was narrowly averted; only when the Arians found

<span id="page_66">p. 66</span>

themselves decisively outnumbered did they accept a creed which
anathematized their teachings.

The creed of 325 is popularly supposed to have been the Nicene Creed of
later prayer books, but in reality it was merely an early and incomplete
draft of that creed. It read:

"We believe in one God, the almighty Father, creator of all things
visible and invisible; and in one Lord, Jesus Christ, born of the
Father, only-begotten—that is, of the substance of the Father, true God
from the true God, born, not made, *homoousion*—that is, with the
substance of the same Father, through whom all things were made which
are in heaven and on earth; who, for the sake of us men and for the sake
of our salvation, descended, and was incarnated, and was made man,
suffered, and arose again on the third day, ascended to heaven, whence
he will come to judge the living and the dead; and in the Holy Ghost.

"However there are those who say: there was a time when he was not, and
before he was born he was not, and that he was not created out of any
substance, or who say that he was transformed from some other substance
or essence—that is, that the Son of God is changeable or mutable—these

<span id="page_67">p. 67</span>

the Catholic and Apostolic Church anathematizes."

*Homoousion*—"of one substance"—or *homoiousion*—"of like substance"—on
this question of a single word the Christian Church was rent apart for
many years. Although the Homoousians seemed to have won a definitive
victory in the adoption of the creed of 325, following which Athanasius
was made bishop of Alexandria, the Homoiousian Arians had given only a
nominal submission. They intrigued successfully at court, another
council was held at Tyre, Athanasius was deposed, and Arius returned to
Alexandria in triumph. It was now the turn of the Athanasians to
intrigue; a third council, two years later, held at Sardica, restored
Athanasius to his diocese. Another two years, and he was again deposed.
So the struggle went on, year after year. Five times Athanasius was
driven into banishment, five times he was restored.

Meanwhile, the Arians, who were energetic missionaries, made many
converts among the Northern barbarians. Ulfilas translated the Bible
into Gothic, thereby making what is generally considered the first
beginning of Teutonic literature. Believing that his converts were
already sufficiently

<span id="page_68">p. 68</span>

warlike, he is said to have omitted the Book of the Kings from his
translation lest it further increase their military ardor. It would have
been well for the cause of peace had theological controversies also been
eliminated in the process of converting the barbarians. Stammering their
first Latin, the Goths became divided into Homoousians and Homoiousians,
and the subtle words of a learned creed served as cause of battle in
distant Gaul and Spain.

After fifty years of conflict, verbal and physical, the Athanasians
emerged triumphant. The Council of Constantinople in A.D. 381 adopted
the Nicene Creed in its present form (with the exception of a single
word, to be discussed later) and further declared this creed to be
unamendable. Henceforward, the creed originated by Athanasius possessed
an authority equal to that of the Bible itself; it had become a third
Christian sacred scripture, brief but fully as potent as the Old and New
Testaments.

The creedal triumph of Athanasius was accompanied by the acceptance of
his personal canon of Biblical Scripture. Under the influence of Jerome
and Augustine, the Athanasian canon was formally adopted by successive
synods in A.D. 382, A.D. 393,

<span id="page_69">p. 69</span>

and A.D. 397. Thus it came about that the Bible contains the books which
it now does.

The final acceptance of the canon was made certain, not only by the
decision of the Church, but by the great Latin translation of Jerome
(completed after fifteen years of labor in A.D. 405), which included
none but the canonical books. An earlier anonymous translation of the
Bible, known as the Old Latin translation, had been circulated since the
second century, but with great divergence among the copies, particularly
between the European and African versions of it. Pope Damasus
commissioned Jerome to make the necessary revision, which he did most
thoroughly, retaining the Old Latin only for the Apocrypha and for the
rest of the Old Testament going directly to the Hebrew text, though this
unfortunately, as of course he could not know, actually represented a
later version than that of the Septuagint on which the Old Latin had
been based.

When the Vulgate, as Jerome's translation came to be called, was put
before the people, it was bitterly attacked because of its alteration of
familiar passages. Jerome was charged by his popular accusers, whom he
contemptuously denominated "two-legged asses," with having impiously
changed

<span id="page_70">p. 70</span>

the words used by the inspired writers of the Bible. It required a
century and a half for his work to win general favor. But after that for
a thousand years it was the only Bible known to western Europe.

In spite of the labors of Athanasius and Jerome, there still remained
disputed points of dogma unmentioned in the creeds and unaffected by the
canon. These questions were settled for orthodox Christianity by the
master mind of Augustine, author of one of the most poignant of
autobiographies, author of the most influential of all theological
works, The City of God. In this last he gathered up and attempted to
synthetize four centuries of Christian thought. With Paul he held to the
dogma of predestination: that by Adam's fall the human race was
corrupted so that men are born in a condition of original sin from which
they can only be redeemed by God's grace operating usually through the
ministrations of the Church. The harshness of this doctrine he tried to
mitigate by holding with Origen that evil is mere privation of the good,
thus introducing a hierarchy of relative goods wherein worldly
possessions are regarded as legitimate so long as they do not turn the
mind from higher things, marriage is still a sacrament

<span id="page_71">p. 71</span>

though celibacy is more blessed, and the State is beneficial as an
earthly institution though the Church, concerned with spiritual things,
is far higher, while highest of all is the Church within the Church, the
City of God, composed of the Elect united in that love of God which is
the supreme good. Thus Augustine found a place in his system for both
the flesh and the spirit, the exoteric and the esoteric, worldly
compromise and pure monasticism, in a system as broad and complex as was
the Church for whose glory it was conceived.

One more heresy arose, indeed, even in Augustine's own time: that of the
British monk, Pelagius, whose follower Coelestius, was condemned by the
Synod of Carthage for holding "seven mortal errors," the most damnable
of which were the assertions that Adam would have died even if he had
not sinned, that the human race as a whole was unaffected by his sin,
that unbaptized children might be saved, and that men were free to will
the good without a special act of God's grace. The simple island monk's
humanitarianism could make no headway against the subtle dialectic of
Augustine, trained in the methods of the Greek philosophers.

Thenceforth for a thousand years there was little danger from individual
heresy. The Church was in

<span id="page_72">p. 72</span>

possession of the Bible, clearly defined creed built upon it, and of a
great mass of literature culminating in the work of Augustine which
could be used to defend the Church's claims. It was well organized under
its established system of bishops, presbyters, and deacons, centered in
the twin seats of empire, Rome and Constantinople. Thus equipped and
organized it would be able to survive even when the empire fell.

Nevertheless, internal unity had not been achieved. Impregnable as it
had become against outside assaults or local rebellions, the Church
still had two heads, and this was one too many. The long quarrel over
the creed had expressed a struggle for power between East and West, the
East being more liberal as it was less ecclesiasticized. Under the
leadership of Athanasius, Jerome, and Augustine, the West had won many
battles, but the conflict was not ended. The further growth of the
Church of Rome was destined to breed irreconcilable differences.

From the first, the Roman Catholic Church had claimed a priority based
on the alleged martyrdom in Rome of Peter, the "Rock" on whom Jesus in
Matthew xvi. 18–19, had said that he would build his church, giving to
him "the keys of the kingdom

<span id="page_73">p. 73</span>

of heaven." As early as the second century Pope Victor I had threatened
to excommunicate the Eastern churches if they did not accept the Roman
date for Easter, a festival which had taken over the old pagan holidays
in celebration of the Spring. In the Athanasian Creed reference is made
to "the Catholic Faith" and "the Catholic Religion" rather than to the
"Christian" faith or religion. After the fall of the Empire in 476 the
Papacy secured control of the city of Rome with vast estates elsewhere
in Italy, Sicily, and Africa. Politics and religion became inextricable
in a church which thus enjoyed both spiritual and temporal power.

Meanwhile, over in Constantinople its Patriarch, who had secured the
primacy among the churches of the East, watched the growth of his
western rival with jealous eyes. The secret enmity between the two heirs
of the Empire came to a head in the ninth century when Pope Nicholas I
and the Patriarch Photius excommunicated each other. Officially, the
quarrel was over the Nicene Creed. In the form of that creed used in the
Roman Catholic Church the word *filioque*—"and from the Son"—had been
added to the description of the Holy Spirit as "proceeding from the
Father." Photius, the greatest scholar of the age, declared that this

<span id="page_74">p. 74</span>

addition, after the Council of Constantinople had declared the creed
unamendable, was sufficient to convict the Roman Church of heresy.
Boasting an Apostolic origin older than that of the Church of Rome, the
Greek Church became "The Holy Orthodox Catholic and Apostolic Oriental
Church" in opposition to "The Holy Orthodox Catholic Apostolic Roman
Church," each denying to the other the right to any of these titles save
the geographic one.

Thus Christianity moved into the Middle Ages divided. But the Greek
Church was early hampered by the growth of Mohammedanism, and aside from
its extension into Russia had all that it could do to maintain itself at
home. The Christianization of western Europe was to be accomplished by
the Roman Catholic Church alone. Centralized and authoritarian as this
body had become, without these qualities it could hardly have succeeded
in its mission.
