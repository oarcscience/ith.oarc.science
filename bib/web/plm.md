### World English Bible: Philemon

<span id="an_1:1">1:1</span> Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and
Timothy our brother, to Philemon, our beloved fellow worker,

<span id="an_1:2">1:2</span> to the beloved Apphia, to Archippus, our
fellow soldier, and to the assembly in your house:

<span id="an_1:3">1:3</span> Grace to you and peace from God our Father
and the Lord Jesus Christ.

<span id="an_1:4">1:4</span> I thank my God always, making mention of
you in my prayers,

<span id="an_1:5">1:5</span> hearing of your love, and of the faith
which you have toward the Lord Jesus, and toward all the saints;

<span id="an_1:6">1:6</span> that the fellowship of your faith may
become effective, in the knowledge of every good thing which is in us in
Christ Jesus.

<span id="an_1:7">1:7</span> For we have much joy and comfort in your
love, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed through you,
brother.

<span id="an_1:8">1:8</span> Therefore, though I have all boldness in
Christ to command you that which is appropriate,

<span id="an_1:9">1:9</span> yet for love's sake I rather beg, being
such a one as Paul, the aged, but also a prisoner of Jesus Christ.

<span id="an_1:10">1:10</span> I beg you for my child, whom I have
become the father of in my chains, Onesimus,

<span id="an_1:11">1:11</span> who once was useless to you, but now is
useful to you and to me.

<span id="an_1:12">1:12</span> I am sending him back. Therefore receive
him, that is, my own heart,

<span id="an_1:13">1:13</span> whom I desired to keep with me, that on
your behalf he might serve me in my chains for the Good News.

<span id="an_1:14">1:14</span> But I was willing to do nothing without
your consent, that your goodness would not be as of necessity, but of
free will.

<span id="an_1:15">1:15</span> For perhaps he was therefore separated
from you for a while, that you would have him forever,

<span id="an_1:16">1:16</span> no longer as a slave, but more than a
slave, a beloved brother, especially to me, but how much rather to you,
both in the flesh and in the Lord.

<span id="an_1:17">1:17</span> If then you count me a partner, receive
him as you would receive me.

<span id="an_1:18">1:18</span> But if he has wronged you at all, or owes
you anything, put that to my account.

<span id="an_1:19">1:19</span> I, Paul, write this with my own hand: I
will repay it (not to mention to you that you owe to me even your own
self besides).

<span id="an_1:20">1:20</span> Yes, brother, let me have joy from you in
the Lord. Refresh my heart in the Lord.

<span id="an_1:21">1:21</span> Having confidence in your obedience, I
write to you, knowing that you will do even beyond what I say.

<span id="an_1:22">1:22</span> Also, prepare a guest room for me, for I
hope that through your prayers I will be restored to you.

<span id="an_1:23">1:23</span> Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ
Jesus, greets you,

<span id="an_1:24">1:24</span> as do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke,
my fellow workers.

<span id="an_1:25">1:25</span> The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be
with your spirit. Amen.
