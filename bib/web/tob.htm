<p><A NAME="an_1:1">1:1</A>&nbsp;The book of the words of Tobit, son of Tobiel, the son of Ananiel, the son of Aduel, the son of Gabael, a descendent of Asael, of the tribe of Naphtali,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:2">1:2</A>&nbsp;who, in the time of Shalmaneser king of the Assyrians, was led captive out of Thisbe, which is at the right hand of that city, which is properly called Naphtali, in Galilee above Asher.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:3">1:3</A>&nbsp;I, Tobit, have walked all the days of my life in the ways of truth and justice, and I performed many charitable deeds for my brethren and my nation, who came with me to Nineveh into the land of the Assyrians.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:4">1:4</A>&nbsp;And when I was in my own country, in the land of Israel, in my youth, with all the tribe of Naphtali, my father fell away from the house of Jerusalem, which was chosen out of all the tribes of Israel so that all the tribes should sacrifice there, where the Temple of the dwelling place of the most High was consecrated and built for all ages.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:5">1:5</A>&nbsp;Now all the tribes which revolted together, and the house of my father Naphtali, sacrificed to the heifer Baal.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:6">1:6</A>&nbsp;But I alone went often to Jerusalem at the feasts, as it was ordained for all the people of Israel by an everlasting decree, bringing the first fruits and tenths of increase, with the first-shorn sheep, and these I gave at the altar to the priests, the children of Aaron.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:7">1:7</A>&nbsp;The first tenth part of all increase I gave to the sons of Aaron, who ministered at Jerusalem; another tenth part I sold, and went, and spent it every year at Jerusalem;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:8">1:8</A>&nbsp;and the third I gave to those who were in need, as Deborah my father's mother had commanded me, because I was left an orphan by my father.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:9">1:9</A>&nbsp;Furthermore, when I had reached the age of a man, I married Anna of my own kindred, and of her, I fathered Tobias.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:10">1:10</A>&nbsp;And when we were carried away captives to Nineveh, all my brethren and those who were of my kindred ate of the bread of the Gentiles.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:11">1:11</A>&nbsp;But I kept myself from eating,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:12">1:12</A>&nbsp;because I remembered God with all my heart.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:13">1:13</A>&nbsp;And the most High gave me grace and favor before Shalmaneser, so that I was his purveyor.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:14">1:14</A>&nbsp;And I went into Media, and I left in trust with Gabael, the brother of Gabrias, at Rages a city of Media, ten talents of silver.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:15">1:15</A>&nbsp;Now when Shalmaneser was dead, Sennacherib his son reigned in his place; but his reign was troubled so that I could not go into Media.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:16">1:16</A>&nbsp;And in the time of Shalmaneser I gave many alms to my brethren and gave my bread to the hungry,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:17">1:17</A>&nbsp;and my clothes to the naked; and if I saw any of my nation dead, or cast out around the walls of Nineveh, I buried him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:18">1:18</A>&nbsp;And if the king Sennacherib had slain anyone, when he arrived and fled from Judea, I buried them privately; for in his wrath he killed many, but the bodies were not found when they were sought by the king.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:19">1:19</A>&nbsp;And when one of the Ninevites went and complained to the king about me, that I buried them and hid myself, I understood that I was sought to be put to death, so I withdrew myself out of fear.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:20">1:20</A>&nbsp;Then all my goods were forcibly taken away, neither was there anything left for me, except my wife Anna and my son Tobias.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:21">1:21</A>&nbsp;And before fifty-five days had passed, two of his sons killed him and they fled into the mountains of Ararath; and Sarchedonus his son reigned in his place; he appointed, over his father's accounts and over all his affairs, Achiacharus, my brother Anael's son.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:22">1:22</A>&nbsp;And since Achiacharus petitioned for me, I returned to Nineveh. Now Achiacharus was cupbearer and keeper of the signet and steward and overseer of the accounts; and Sarchedonus appointed him next to him; and he was my brother's son.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:1">2:1</A>&nbsp;Now when I arrived home again, and my wife Anna was restored to me with my son Tobias, at the feast of Pentecost, which is the holy feast of the seven weeks, a good dinner was prepared for me, which I sat down to eat.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:2">2:2</A>&nbsp;And when I saw the abundance of meat, I said to my son, "Go and bring whatsoever poor man you find among our brethren, who is mindful of the Lord, and, see, I will wait for you."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:3">2:3</A>&nbsp;But he returned and said, "Father, one of our nation was strangled and cast out in the marketplace."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:4">2:4</A>&nbsp;Then, before I had tasted any of the meat, I went out, and took him up into a room until sundown.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:5">2:5</A>&nbsp;Then I returned, and washed myself, and ate my meat in sadness,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:6">2:6</A>&nbsp;remembering the prophecy of Amos, as he said, "Your feasts shall be turned into mourning and all your mirth into lamentation."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:7">2:7</A>&nbsp;Therefore I wept, and after sundown I went and made a grave and buried him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:8">2:8</A>&nbsp;But my neighbors mocked me and said, "This man is still not afraid to be put to death for this matter; and, see, though he fled away before, he now buries the dead again."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:9">2:9</A>&nbsp;That same night, I returned from the burial and slept by the wall of my courtyard, because I was polluted. And my face was uncovered,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:10">2:10</A>&nbsp;and I did not know that there were sparrows in the wall. And, since my eyes were open, the sparrows emitted warm dung into my eyes, and a whiteness fell into my eyes. And I went to the physicians, but they did not help me. Moreover, Achiacharus had to nourish me, until I went into Elymais.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:11">2:11</A>&nbsp;And my wife Anna took in women's work.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:12">2:12</A>&nbsp;And when she had sent these home again to the owners, they paid her her wages and gave her in addition a young goat.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:13">2:13</A>&nbsp;And when it was in my house, and began to call out, I said to her, "Where did this young goat come from? Is it not stolen? Return it to the owners, for it is not lawful to eat anything which is stolen."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:14">2:14</A>&nbsp;But she replied to me, "It was given as a gift, over and above my wages." However, I did not believe her, but directed her to return it to the owners, and I was ashamed at her. But she replied to me, "Where are your alms and your righteous deeds? See now, you and all your works are known."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:1">3:1</A>&nbsp;Then I was grieved and I wept, and in my sorrow I prayed, saying,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:2">3:2</A>&nbsp;"O Lord, you are just, and all your works and all your ways are mercy and truth, and you judge truly and justly for ever.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:3">3:3</A>&nbsp;Remember me and look upon me, do not punish me for my sins and my ignorance, nor for the sins of my fathers, who sinned before you,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:4">3:4</A>&nbsp;for they did not obey your commandments. Therefore you have delivered us as spoil, and into captivity, and to death, and as a proverb of reproach to all the nations among whom we are dispersed.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:5">3:5</A>&nbsp;And now your judgments are many and true. Deal with me according to my sins and my fathers' sins, because we have not kept your commandments, nor have we walked in truth before you.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:6">3:6</A>&nbsp;Now therefore deal with me as it seems best to you, and command my spirit to be taken from me, so that I may be dissolved and become earth; for it is better for me to die than to live, because I have heard false reproaches and have much sorrow. Command therefore that I may now be delivered out of this distress and go into the everlasting place. Do not turn your face away from me."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:7">3:7</A>&nbsp;It happened the same day, in Ecbatane a city of Media, that Sarah the daughter of Raguel was also reproached by her father's maids;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:8">3:8</A>&nbsp;because she had been married to seven husbands, whom Asmodeus the evil spirit had killed, before they had lain with her. "Do you not know," they said, "that you have strangled your husbands? You have already had seven husbands, yet you have not taken the name of any of them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:9">3:9</A>&nbsp;So then, do you beat us because of them? If they are dead, go your way after them; let us never see either son or daughter from you."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:10">3:10</A>&nbsp;When she heard these things, she was very sorrowful, so that she thought about strangling herself; but she said, "I am the only daughter of my father, and if I do this, it shall be a reproach to him, and I shall bring his old age with sorrow to the grave."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:11">3:11</A>&nbsp;Then she prayed toward the window and said, "Blessed are you, O Lord my God, and your holy and glorious name is blessed and honorable for ever; let all your works praise you for ever.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:12">3:12</A>&nbsp;And now, O Lord, I set my eyes and my face toward you,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:13">3:13</A>&nbsp;and say, 'Take me out of the earth, so that I may no longer hear this reproach.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:14">3:14</A>&nbsp;You know, Lord, that I am pure, free from all sin with man,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:15">3:15</A>&nbsp;and that I never polluted my name, nor the name of my father, in the land of my captivity. I am the only daughter of my father, and he has no child to be his heir; nor does he have any near kinsman, nor any son of a near kinsman alive, to whom I might give myself as a wife. My seven husbands are already dead and so why should I live? But if it does not please you that I should die, then command some regard to be given to me and pity to be taken on me, so that I will no longer hear reproach.'"</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:16">3:16</A>&nbsp;So the prayers of them both were heard before the majesty of the great God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:17">3:17</A>&nbsp;And Raphael was sent to heal them both, that is, to scale away the whiteness of Tobit's eyes, and to give Sarah the daughter of Raguel as a wife to Tobias the son of Tobit; and to bind Asmodeus the evil spirit, because she belonged to Tobias by right of inheritance. At the very same time, Tobit came home and entered into his house, and Sarah the daughter of Raguel came down from her upper room.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:1">4:1</A>&nbsp;On that day Tobit remembered the money which he had committed to Gabael in Rages of Media,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:2">4:2</A>&nbsp;and he said to himself, "I have wished for death; therefore should I not call for my son Tobias so that I may transfer the money to him before I die?"</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:3">4:3</A>&nbsp;And when he had called him, he said, "My son, when I am dead, bury me; and do not despise your mother, but honor her all the days of your life, and do what pleases her, and do not grieve her.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:4">4:4</A>&nbsp;Remember, my son, that she endured many dangers for you, when you were in her womb; and when she is dead, bury her next to me in one grave.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:5">4:5</A>&nbsp;My son, be mindful of the Lord our God all your days, and do not let your will be set to sin, nor to transgress his commandments; act uprightly all your life long, and do not follow the ways of the unrighteousness.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:6">4:6</A>&nbsp;For if you deal truly, your actions shall bring prosperity to you and to all those who live justly.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:7">4:7</A>&nbsp;"Give alms from your resources; and when you give alms, do not let your eye be envious, nor turn your face from any of the poor, and then the face of God shall not be turned away from you.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:8">4:8</A>&nbsp;If you have abundance, give alms accordingly; if you have only a little, do not be afraid to give according to that little;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:9">4:9</A>&nbsp;for you will store up a good treasure for yourself against the day of necessity,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:10">4:10</A>&nbsp;because alms deliver from death and preserve from falling into darkness.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:11">4:11</A>&nbsp;For alms is a good gift, for all those who give it, in the sight of the most High.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:12">4:12</A>&nbsp;Beware of all whoredom, my son, and prefer to take a wife from the posterity of your forefathers, and do not take a strange woman to wife, who is not of your father's tribe; for we are the children of the prophets, Noah, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Remember, my son, that our fathers from the beginning, all of them married wives of their own kindred, and were blessed in their children, and their posterity shall inherit the land.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:13">4:13</A>&nbsp;Now therefore, my son, love your brethren, and do not despise in your heart your brethren, the sons and daughters of your people, by not taking a wife from among them; for in pride is destruction and much trouble, and in lewdness is decay and great want; for lewdness is the mother of famine.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:14">4:14</A>&nbsp;"Do not let the wages of any man, who has worked for you, be delayed by you, but give it to him promptly; for if you serve God, he will also repay you. Be prudent, my son, in all things you do, and be wise in all your conversation.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:15">4:15</A>&nbsp;Do not do to any man the things which you yourself hate. Do not drink wine to make you drunken; neither let drunkenness go with you on your journey.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:16">4:16</A>&nbsp;Give of your bread to the hungry, and of your garments to those who are naked; and according to your abundance give alms; and do not let your eye be envious, when you give alms.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:17">4:17</A>&nbsp;Pour out your bread on the burial of the just, but give nothing to the wicked.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:18">4:18</A>&nbsp;Ask counsel of all who are wise, and despise not any counsel which is beneficial.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:19">4:19</A>&nbsp;"Bless the Lord your God always, and desire of him that your ways may be purposeful, and that all your paths and counsels may prosper; for not every nation has counsel; but the Lord himself gives all good things, and he humbles whom he will, as he will; now therefore, my son, remember my commandments, neither let them be put out of your mind.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:20">4:20</A>&nbsp;And now I signify this to those who I committed ten talents, to Gabael the son of Gabrias at Rages in Media.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:21">4:21</A>&nbsp;And do not be afraid, my son, that we might become poor; for you have much wealth, if you fear God and depart from all sin and do what is pleasing in his sight."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:1">5:1</A>&nbsp;Tobias then answered and said, "Father, I will do all things which you have commanded me;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:2">5:2</A>&nbsp;but how can I receive the money, since I do not know him?"</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:3">5:3</A>&nbsp;Then he gave him the handwriting, and said to him, "Seek a man to go with you, while I yet live, and I will give him wages; then go and receive the money."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:4">5:4</A>&nbsp;Therefore, when he went to seek a man, he found Raphael who was an angel,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:5">5:5</A>&nbsp;but he did not know it; and so he said to him, "Can you go with me to Rages? And do you know those places well?"</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:6">5:6</A>&nbsp;The angel said to him, "I will go with you, and I know the way well, for I have stayed with our brother Gabael."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:7">5:7</A>&nbsp;Then Tobias said to him, "Wait for me, while I tell my father."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:8">5:8</A>&nbsp;Then he said to him, "Go and do not delay." So he went in and said to his father, "See now, I have found one who will go with me." Then he said, "Call him to me, so that I may learn what tribe he is from and whether he is a trustworthy man to go with you."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:9">5:9</A>&nbsp;So he called him, and he came in, and they greeted one another.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:10">5:10</A>&nbsp;Then Tobit said to him, "Brother, tell me what tribe and family you are from."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:11">5:11</A>&nbsp;He said to him, "Do you seek for a tribe or family, or for a hired man to go with your son?" Then Tobit said to him, "I would know, brother, your kindred and name."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:12">5:12</A>&nbsp;Then he said, "I am Azariah, the son of Ananiah the great and of your brethren."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:13">5:13</A>&nbsp;Then Tobit said, "You are welcome, brother; do not be angry with me now, because I asked about your tribe and your family; for you are my brother, of an honest and good stock. For I know Ananiah and Jonathan, sons of that great Samaiah, because we went together to Jerusalem to worship, and offered the firstborn, and the tenths of the fruits; and they were not seduced with the error of our brethren. My brother, you are of good stock.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:14">5:14</A>&nbsp;But tell me, what wages shall I give you? Will you accept a drachma a day, plus whatever is needed for my own son?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:15">5:15</A>&nbsp;Fine, but moreover, if you return safe, I will add something to your wages."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:16">5:16</A>&nbsp;So they were well pleased. Then he said to Tobias, "Prepare yourself for the journey, and may God give you a good journey." And when his son had prepared everything for the journey, his father said, "Go with this man; and may God who dwells in heaven prosper your journey, and may the angel of God keep you company." So they both went forth, and the young man's dog with them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:17">5:17</A>&nbsp;But Anna his mother wept and said to Tobit, "Why have you sent our son away? Is he not the staff of our hand, in going in and out before us?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:18">5:18</A>&nbsp;Do not be greedy to add money to money, but consider it as refuse compared to our child.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:19">5:19</A>&nbsp;For what the Lord has given us to live on should be sufficient for us."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:20">5:20</A>&nbsp;Then Tobit said to her, "Do not worry, my sister; he will return in safety, and your eyes will see him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:21">5:21</A>&nbsp;For the good angel will keep him company, and his journey will be prosperous, and he will return safe."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:22">5:22</A>&nbsp;Then she ended her weeping.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:1">6:1</A>&nbsp;And as they went on their journey, they arrived in the evening at the river Tigris, and they lodged there.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:2">6:2</A>&nbsp;And when the young man went down to wash himself, a fish leaped out of the river and would have devoured him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:3">6:3</A>&nbsp;Then the angel said to him, "Take the fish." And the young man took hold of the fish, and drew it to land.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:4">6:4</A>&nbsp;The angel said to him, "Open the fish, and take the heart and the liver and the gall, and store them well."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:5">6:5</A>&nbsp;So the young man did as the angel commanded him. And when they had roasted the fish, they ate it. Then they both went on their way, until they drew near to Ecbatane.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:6">6:6</A>&nbsp;Then the young man said to the angel, "Brother Azariah, of what use is the heart and the liver and the gall of the fish?"</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:7">6:7</A>&nbsp;And he said to him, "Concerning the heart and the liver, if a devil or an evil spirit troubles anyone, we must make a smoke of these in front of the man or the woman, and then the person will no longer be troubled.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:8">6:8</A>&nbsp;As for the gall, it is used to anoint a man who has whiteness in his eyes, so he shall be healed."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:9">6:9</A>&nbsp;And when they had arrived near Rages,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:10">6:10</A>&nbsp;the angel said to the young man, "Brother, today we will stay with Raguel, who is your cousin; he also has only one daughter, named Sarah; I will speak on her behalf, so that she may be given to you as a wife,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:11">6:11</A>&nbsp;for the rights concerning her belong to you, because you are her only kindred.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:12">6:12</A>&nbsp;And the maiden is fair and wise; therefore listen to me now, and I will speak to her father. And when we return from Rages, we will celebrate the marriage, for I know that Raguel cannot give her in marriage to another, according to the Law of Moses, or he would be liable to death, because the right of inheritance belongs to you more than to any other."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:13">6:13</A>&nbsp;Then the young man answered the angel, "I have heard, brother Azariah, that this maiden has been given to seven men, who each died in the marriage room.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:14">6:14</A>&nbsp;And now, I am the only son of my father and I am afraid that if I go in to her, I may die, as the others before me, for a wicked spirit loves her, and he hurts no one except those who come to her. Therefore, I also fear that I may die, and bring my father's life and my mother's life because of me to the grave with sorrow; for they have no other son to bury them."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:15">6:15</A>&nbsp;Then the angel said to him, "Do you not remember the precepts which your father gave you, that you should marry a wife of your own kindred? Therefore hear me, O my brother; for she shall be given to you as a wife; and have no regard for the evil spirit; for this same night she shall be given to you in marriage.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:16">6:16</A>&nbsp;And when you come into the marriage room, you shall take the ashes of perfume, and shall lay upon them some of the heart and liver of the fish, and shall make a smoke with it.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:17">6:17</A>&nbsp;And the devil will smell it, and flee away, and never again return. But when you come to her, rise up both of you and pray to God, who is merciful, who will have pity on you and save you. Fear not, for she is appointed to you from the beginning; and you will keep her, and she will accompany you. Moreover, I suppose that she will bear you children." Now, when Tobias had heard these things, he loved her, and his heart was ready to be joined to her.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:1">7:1</A>&nbsp;And when they arrived at Ecbatane, they came to the house of Raguel, and Sarah met them. And after they had greeted one another, she brought them into the house.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:2">7:2</A>&nbsp;Then Raguel said to Edna his wife, "How much this young man is like Tobit my kinsman!"</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:3">7:3</A>&nbsp;And Raguel asked them, "Where do you come from, brethren?" They said to him, "We are of the sons of Naphtali, who are captives in Nineveh."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:4">7:4</A>&nbsp;Then he said to them, "Do you know Tobit our kinsman?" And they said, "We know him." Then he said, "Is he in good health?"</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:5">7:5</A>&nbsp;And they said, "He is both alive and in good health." And Tobias said, "He is my father."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:6">7:6</A>&nbsp;Then Raguel leaped up and kissed him and wept.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:7">7:7</A>&nbsp;And he blessed him and said to him, "You are the son of an honest and good man." But when he heard that Tobit was blind, he was sorrowful and wept.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:8">7:8</A>&nbsp;And likewise Edna his wife and Sarah his daughter wept. Yet still they entertained them cheerfully, and afterwards they had a ram of the flock killed, and they set a supply of meat on the table. Then Tobias said to Raphael, "Brother Azariah, speak about those things which you spoke about on the way here, and let this matter be completed."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:9">7:9</A>&nbsp;So he communicated the matter to Raguel. And Raguel said to Tobias, "Eat and drink, and make merry,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:10">7:10</A>&nbsp;for it is fitting that you should marry my daughter. Nevertheless I will declare to you the truth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:11">7:11</A>&nbsp;I have given my daughter in marriage to seven men, who each died on the night that they came in to her. Nevertheless be merry for now." But Tobias said, "I will eat nothing here until we agree and swear one to another."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:12">7:12</A>&nbsp;Raguel said, "Then take her from this time forward, according to the custom, for you are her kinsman, and she is yours, and may the merciful God give you good success in all things."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:13">7:13</A>&nbsp;Then he called his daughter Sarah, and she came to her father, and he took her by the hand and gave her to be wife to Tobias, saying, "Behold, take her after the Law of Moses, and lead her away to your father." And he blessed them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:14">7:14</A>&nbsp;And he called Edna his wife, and took paper and wrote an instrument of covenants and sealed it.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:15">7:15</A>&nbsp;Then they began to eat.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:16">7:16</A>&nbsp;Afterwards Raguel called his wife Edna and said to her, "Sister, prepare another room and bring her into it."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:17">7:17</A>&nbsp;Then, when she had done as he had asked her, she brought her into it. And she wept and received the tears of her daughter, and she said to her,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:18">7:18</A>&nbsp;"Be of good comfort, my daughter. May the Lord of heaven and earth give you joy in place of this your sorrow. Be of good comfort, my daughter."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:1">8:1</A>&nbsp;And when they had dined, they brought Tobias in to her.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:2">8:2</A>&nbsp;And as he went, he remembered the words of Raphael. And he took the ashes of the perfumes, and put the heart and the liver of the fish on them, and made a smoke with them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:3">8:3</A>&nbsp;When the evil spirit had smelled this odor, he fled into the utmost parts of Egypt, and the angel bound him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:4">8:4</A>&nbsp;And afterwards, when they were both secluded together, Tobias rose out of the bed and said, "Sister, arise, and let us pray that God will have pity on us."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:5">8:5</A>&nbsp;Then Tobias began to say, "Blessed are you, O God of our fathers, and blessed is your holy and glorious name for ever; let the heavens bless you, and all your creatures.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:6">8:6</A>&nbsp;You made Adam, and gave him Eve his wife as a helper and support; of them came mankind, for you have said, 'It is not good that man should be alone; let us make him a helper like himself.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:7">8:7</A>&nbsp;And now, O Lord, I take not this my sister for pleasure, but in righteousness; therefore mercifully ordain that we may grow old together."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:8">8:8</A>&nbsp;And she said with him, "Amen."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:9">8:9</A>&nbsp;So they both slept that night. And Raguel arose, and went and made a grave,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:10">8:10</A>&nbsp;saying, "I am afraid that he too is dead."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:11">8:11</A>&nbsp;But when Raguel returned to his house,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:12">8:12</A>&nbsp;he said to his wife Edna, "Send one of the maids, and let her see if he is alive. If he is not, then we can bury him, and no one will know of it."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:13">8:13</A>&nbsp;So the maid opened the door and went in and found them both asleep.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:14">8:14</A>&nbsp;And she came forth and told them that he was alive.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:15">8:15</A>&nbsp;Then Raguel praised God and said, "O God, you are worthy to be praised with all pure and holy praise; therefore let your saints praise you with all your creatures, and let all your angels and your elect praise you for ever.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:16">8:16</A>&nbsp;You are to be praised, for you have made me joyful; and what I feared has not happened, but you have dealt with us according to your great mercy.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:17">8:17</A>&nbsp;You are to be praised because you had mercy on two who were each the only begotten children of their fathers; grant them mercy, O Lord, and finish their life in health with joy and mercy."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:18">8:18</A>&nbsp;Then Raguel directed his servants to fill the grave.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:19">8:19</A>&nbsp;And he kept the wedding feast for fourteen days.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:20">8:20</A>&nbsp;For before the days of the marriage were finished, Raguel had said to him by an oath, that he should not depart until the fourteen days of the marriage were fulfilled,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:21">8:21</A>&nbsp;and that then he should take half of his goods and go in safety to his father, and that he would have the rest "when I and my wife are dead."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:1">9:1</A>&nbsp;Then Tobias called Raphael and said to him,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:2">9:2</A>&nbsp;"Brother Azariah, take a servant and two camels with you, and go to Rages of Media to Gabael, and bring me the money and bring him to the wedding.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:3">9:3</A>&nbsp;For Raguel has sworn that I shall not depart,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:4">9:4</A>&nbsp;but my father counts the days, and if I delay for long, he will be very sorrowful."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:5">9:5</A>&nbsp;So Raphael went out and lodged with Gabael and gave him the handwriting, so he brought out bags which were sealed up and gave them to him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:6">9:6</A>&nbsp;And early in the morning they both went forth together, and they arrived at the wedding; and Tobias blessed his wife.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:1">10:1</A>&nbsp;Now Tobit his father counted every day; and when the days for the journey were completed, and they had not returned,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:2">10:2</A>&nbsp;then Tobit said, "Are they detained? Or is Gabael dead and there is no man to give him the money?"</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:3">10:3</A>&nbsp;Therefore he was very sorrowful.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:4">10:4</A>&nbsp;Then his wife said to him, "My son must be dead, since he has been gone so long." And she began to wail him and said,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:5">10:5</A>&nbsp;"Now I care for nothing, my son, since I have let go of you, who is the light of my eyes."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:6">10:6</A>&nbsp;Tobit said to her, "Hold your peace; do not worry, for he is safe."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:7">10:7</A>&nbsp;But she said, "Hold your peace and deceive me not; my son is dead." And she went out every day into the way, by which they had departed, and she ate no meat in the daytime, and she did not cease throughout the nights to bewail her son Tobias, until the fourteen days of the wedding were completed, which Raguel had sworn that he should spend there. Then Tobias said to Raguel, "Let me go, for my father and my mother must have stopped looking for me."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:8">10:8</A>&nbsp;But his father-in-law said to him, "Remain with me, and I will send messengers to your father, and they will declare to him how things go with you."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:9">10:9</A>&nbsp;But Tobias said, "No. But let me go to my father."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:10">10:10</A>&nbsp;Then Raguel arose, and gave him Sarah his wife, and half his goods, servants, and cattle, and money.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:11">10:11</A>&nbsp;And he blessed them and sent them away, saying, "May the God of heaven give you a prosperous journey, my children."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:12">10:12</A>&nbsp;And he said to his daughter, "Honor your father and your mother-in-law, who are now your parents, so that I may hear a good report about you." And he kissed her. Edna also said to Tobias, "May the Lord of heaven return you, my dear brother, and grant that I may see your children of my daughter Sarah before I die, so that I may rejoice before the Lord. See now, I commit my daughter to you with a special trust; therefore do not lead her into evil."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:1">11:1</A>&nbsp;After these things Tobias went his way praising God because he had given him a prosperous journey, and he blessed Raguel and Edna his wife, and went on his way until they drew near to Nineveh.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:2">11:2</A>&nbsp;Then Raphael said to Tobias, "You know, brother, how you left your father;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:3">11:3</A>&nbsp;let us hurry ahead, before your wife, and prepare the house;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:4">11:4</A>&nbsp;and you should carry in your hand the gall of the fish." So they went their way, and the dog went after them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:5">11:5</A>&nbsp;Now Anna sat looking around, toward the way, for her son.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:6">11:6</A>&nbsp;And when she spotted him arriving, she said to his father, "See now, your son arrives, and the man who went with him."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:7">11:7</A>&nbsp;Then Raphael said, "I know, Tobias, that your father will open his eyes.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:8">11:8</A>&nbsp;Therefore anoint his eyes with the gall, and being irritated by it, he will rub his eyes and the whiteness will fall away, and then he will see you."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:9">11:9</A>&nbsp;Then Anna ran forth, and fell upon the neck of her son, and said to him, "Since I have seen you, my son, from now on I am content to die." And they both wept.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:10">11:10</A>&nbsp;Tobit also went forth toward the door, and stumbled, but his son ran to him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:11">11:11</A>&nbsp;And he took hold of his father and struck his fathers' eyes with the gall, saying, "Be of good hope, my father."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:12">11:12</A>&nbsp;And when his eyes began to sting, he rubbed them;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:13">11:13</A>&nbsp;and the whiteness pealed away from the corners of his eyes; and when he saw his son, he fell upon his neck.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:14">11:14</A>&nbsp;And he wept and said, "Blessed are you, O God, and blessed is your name for ever; and blessed are all your holy angels.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:15">11:15</A>&nbsp;For you have scourged me, and have taken pity on me; for, behold, I see my son Tobias." And his son went in rejoicing, and he told his father the great things which had happened to him in Media.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:16">11:16</A>&nbsp;Then Tobit went out to meet his daughter-in-law at the gate of Nineveh, rejoicing and praising God; and those who saw him go marveled because he had received his sight.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:17">11:17</A>&nbsp;But Tobit gave thanks before them, because God had mercy on him. And when he came near to Sarah his daughter-in-law, he blessed her, saying, "You are welcome, daughter. May God be blessed, who brought you to us, and blessed be your father and your mother." And there was joy among all his brethren who were at Nineveh.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:18">11:18</A>&nbsp;And Achiacharus, and Nasbas his brother's son, came.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:19">11:19</A>&nbsp;And Tobias' wedding was kept for seven days with great joy.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:1">12:1</A>&nbsp;Then Tobit called his son Tobias and said to him, "My son, see that the man who went with you has his wages and you must give him more."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:2">12:2</A>&nbsp;And Tobias said to him, "O father, it is no harm to me to give him half of those things which I have brought,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:3">12:3</A>&nbsp;for he has returned me to you in safety, and made my wife whole, and brought me the money, and likewise healed you."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:4">12:4</A>&nbsp;Then the old man said, "It is due to him."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:5">12:5</A>&nbsp;So he called the angel and he said to him, "Take half of all that you have brought and go away in safety."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:6">12:6</A>&nbsp;Then the angel took them both aside and said to them, "Bless God, praise him, and magnify him, and praise him for all the things which he has done for you in the sight of all who live. It is good to praise God and exalt his name and to honorably show forth the works of God; therefore do not be negligent in praising him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:7">12:7</A>&nbsp;It is good to keep close the secret of a king, but it is honorable to reveal the works of God. Do what is good and no evil shall touch you.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:8">12:8</A>&nbsp;Prayer is good with fasting and alms and righteousness. A little with righteousness is better than much with unrighteousness. It is better to give alms than to store up gold,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:9">12:9</A>&nbsp;for alms can deliver from death and will purge away all sin. Those who practice almsgiving and righteousness shall be filled with life;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:10">12:10</A>&nbsp;but those who sin are enemies to their own life.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:11">12:11</A>&nbsp;Surely I will withhold nothing from you, for I said that it is good to keep close the secret of a king, but that it is honorable to reveal the works of God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:12">12:12</A>&nbsp;Now therefore, when you pray, and when Sarah your daughter-in-law prays, I will bring the remembrance of your prayers before the Holy One. And when you buried the dead, I was with you likewise.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:13">12:13</A>&nbsp;And when you did not delay to rise up and leave your dinner, to go and cover the dead, your good deed was not hidden from me, but I was with you.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:14">12:14</A>&nbsp;And now God has sent me to heal you and Sarah your daughter-in-law.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:15">12:15</A>&nbsp;I am Raphael, one of the seven holy angels, who present the prayers of the saints, and who go in and out before the glory of the Holy One."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:16">12:16</A>&nbsp;Then they were both troubled and fell upon their faces, for they were afraid.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:17">12:17</A>&nbsp;But he said to them, "Fear not, for it shall go well with you; therefore praise God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:18">12:18</A>&nbsp;For I came, not by any favor of mine, but by the will of our God; therefore praise him for ever.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:19">12:19</A>&nbsp;All these days I appeared to you, yet I neither ate nor drank, but you saw a vision.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:20">12:20</A>&nbsp;Now therefore give God thanks, for I go up to him who sent me; but write all these things which have happened in a book."</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:21">12:21</A>&nbsp;And when they arose, they saw him no more.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:22">12:22</A>&nbsp;Then they confessed the great and wonderful works of God, and how the angel of the Lord had appeared to them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:1">13:1</A>&nbsp;Then Tobit wrote a prayer of rejoicing and said, "Blessed be God who lives for ever and blessed be his kingdom.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:2">13:2</A>&nbsp;For he scourges and has mercy; he leads down to hell and brings up again; neither is there any who can avoid his hand.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:3">13:3</A>&nbsp;Confess him before the Gentiles, you children of Israel, for he has scattered us among them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:4">13:4</A>&nbsp;There declare his greatness and extol him before all the living, for he is our Lord and he is the God our Father for ever.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:5">13:5</A>&nbsp;And he will scourge us for our iniquities, and will have mercy again, and will gather us out of all the nations among whom he has scattered us.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:6">13:6</A>&nbsp;If you turn to him with your whole heart and with your whole mind and deal uprightly before him, then he will turn to you and will not hide his face from you. Therefore see what he will do with you, and confess him with your whole mouth, and praise the Lord of might, and extol the everlasting King. In the land of my captivity, I praise him and declare his might and majesty to a sinful nation. O you sinners, turn and do justice before him; who can tell if he will accept you and have mercy on you?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:7">13:7</A>&nbsp;"I will extol my God and my soul shall praise the King of heaven and shall rejoice in his greatness.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:8">13:8</A>&nbsp;Let all men speak and let all praise him for his righteousness.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:9">13:9</A>&nbsp;O Jerusalem, the holy city, he will scourge you for your children's works and will have mercy again on the sons of the righteous.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:10">13:10</A>&nbsp;Give praise to the Lord, for he is good, and praise the everlasting King, so that his tabernacle may be built in you again with joy; and there let him make joyful in you those who are captives, and love in you for ever those who are miserable.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:11">13:11</A>&nbsp;Many nations shall come from far to the name of the Lord God with gifts in their hands, with gifts to the King of heaven; all generations shall praise you with great joy.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:12">13:12</A>&nbsp;Cursed are all those who hate you and blessed shall be all those who love you for ever.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:13">13:13</A>&nbsp;Rejoice and be glad for the children of the just, for they shall be gathered together and shall bless the Lord of the just.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:14">13:14</A>&nbsp;O blessed are those who love you, for they shall rejoice in your peace. Blessed are those who have been sorrowful for all your scourges, for they shall rejoice for you, when they have seen all your glory, and shall be glad for ever.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:15">13:15</A>&nbsp;Let my soul bless God the great King.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:16">13:16</A>&nbsp;For Jerusalem shall be built up with sapphires and emeralds and precious stone, your walls and towers and battlements with pure gold.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:17">13:17</A>&nbsp;And the streets of Jerusalem shall be paved with beryl and carbuncle and stones of Ophir.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:18">13:18</A>&nbsp;And all her streets shall say, 'Alleluia,' and they shall praise him, saying, 'Blessed be God, who has extolled it for ever.'"</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:1">14:1</A>&nbsp;So Tobit ended his prayer praising God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:2">14:2</A>&nbsp;And he was fifty-eight years old when he lost his sight, which was restored to him after eight years; and he gave alms, and he increased in the fear of the Lord God and praised him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:3">14:3</A>&nbsp;And when he was very aged, he called his son, and the sons of his son, and said to him, "My son, take your children, for see now I am aged and ready to depart out of this life.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:4">14:4</A>&nbsp;Go into Media, my son, for I surely believe those things which Jonah the prophet spoke about Nineveh, that it shall be overthrown, and that for a time peace shall rest in Media instead, and that our brethren shall lie scattered across the earth from that good land, and Jerusalem shall be desolate, and the house of God in it shall be burned and shall be desolate for a time.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:5">14:5</A>&nbsp;And again God will have mercy on them and bring them again into the land, where they shall build a temple, but not like the first, until the time of that age is fulfilled; and afterward they shall return from all the places of their captivity and build up Jerusalem gloriously, and the house of God shall be built in it for ever with a glorious building, just as the prophets have spoken.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:6">14:6</A>&nbsp;And all nations shall turn and fear the Lord God truly, and shall bury their idols.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:7">14:7</A>&nbsp;So shall all nations praise the Lord, and his people shall confess God, and the Lord will exalt his people; and all those who love the Lord God in truth and justice shall rejoice, showing mercy to our brethren.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:8">14:8</A>&nbsp;"And now, my son, depart out of Nineveh, because those things of which the prophet Jonah spoke will surely come to pass.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:9">14:9</A>&nbsp;But you, keep the law and the commandments and show yourself to be merciful and just, so that it may go well with you.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:10">14:10</A>&nbsp;And bury me decently, and your mother with me; but delay no longer at Nineveh. Remember, my son, how Aman handled Achiacharus, who brought him up; how out of light he brought him into darkness, and how he took notice of him again; yet Achiacharus was saved, but the other had his just reward, for he went down into darkness. Manasseh gave alms and escaped the snares of death which they had set for him, but Aman fell into the snare and perished.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:11">14:11</A>&nbsp;Therefore now, my son, consider what alms can do and how righteousness can deliver." When he had said these things, he gave up his spirit in the bed, when he was one hundred fifty-eight years old; and he buried him honorably.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:12">14:12</A>&nbsp;And when Anna his mother was dead, he buried her with his father. But Tobias departed with his wife and children to Ecbatane, to Raguel his father-in-law.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:13">14:13</A>&nbsp;There he became old with honor, and he buried his father-in-law and mother-in-law honorably, and he inherited their belongings and his father Tobit's belongings.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:14">14:14</A>&nbsp;And he died at Ecbatane in Media, when he was one hundred twenty-seven years old.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:15">14:15</A>&nbsp;But before he died, he heard of the destruction of Nineveh, which was taken by Nebuchadnezzar and Ahasuerus; and before his death he rejoiced over Nineveh.</p>
