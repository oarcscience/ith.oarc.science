<span id="an_4:37">4:37</span> and Ziza the son of Shiphi, the son of
Allon, the son of Jedaiah, the son of Shimri, the son of Shemaiah--

<span id="an_4:38">4:38</span> these mentioned by name were princes in
their families: and their fathers' houses increased greatly.

<span id="an_4:39">4:39</span> They went to the entrance of Gedor, even
to the east side of the valley, to seek pasture for their flocks.

<span id="an_4:40">4:40</span> They found fat pasture and good, and the
land was wide, and quiet, and peaceable; for those who lived there
before were of Ham.

<span id="an_4:41">4:41</span> These written by name came in the days of
Hezekiah king of Judah, and struck their tents, and the Meunim who were
found there, and destroyed them utterly to this day, and lived in their
place; because there was pasture there for their flocks.

<span id="an_4:42">4:42</span> Some of them, even of the sons of Simeon,
five hundred men, went to Mount Seir, having for their captains
Pelatiah, and Neariah, and Rephaiah, and Uzziel, the sons of Ishi.

<span id="an_4:43">4:43</span> They struck the remnant of the Amalekites
who escaped, and have lived there to this day.

<span id="an_5:1">5:1</span> The sons of Reuben the firstborn of Israel
(for he was the firstborn; but, because he defiled his father's couch,
his birthright was given to the sons of Joseph the son of Israel; and
the genealogy is not to be reckoned after the birthright.

<span id="an_5:2">5:2</span> For Judah prevailed above his brothers, and
of him came the prince; but the birthright was Joseph's:)

<span id="an_5:3">5:3</span> the sons of Reuben the firstborn of Israel:
Hanoch, and Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi.

of Assyria carried away captive: he was prince of the Reubenites.

<span id="an_5:7">5:7</span> His brothers by their families, when the
genealogy of their generations was reckoned: the chief, Jeiel, and
Zechariah,

<span id="an_5:8">5:8</span> and Bela the son of Azaz, the son of Shema,
the son of Joel, who lived in Aroer, even to Nebo and Baal Meon:

<span id="an_5:9">5:9</span> and eastward he lived even to the entrance
of the wilderness from the river Euphrates, because their livestock were
multiplied in the land of Gilead.

<span id="an_5:10">5:10</span> In the days of Saul, they made war with
the Hagrites, who fell by their hand; and they lived in their tents
throughout all the \[land\] east of Gilead.

<span id="an_5:11">5:11</span> The sons of Gad lived over against them,
in the land of Bashan to Salecah:

<span id="an_5:12">5:12</span> Joel the chief, and Shapham the second,
and Janai, and Shaphat in Bashan.

<span id="an_5:13">5:13</span> Their brothers of their fathers' houses:
Michael, and Meshullam, and Sheba, and Jorai, and Jacan, and Zia, and
Eber, seven.

<span id="an_5:14">5:14</span> These were the sons of Abihail, the son
of Huri, the son of Jaroah, the son of Gilead, the son of Michael, the
son of Jeshishai, the son of Jahdo, the son of Buz;

<span id="an_5:15">5:15</span> Ahi the son of Abdiel, the son of Guni,
chief of their fathers' houses.

<span id="an_5:16">5:16</span> They lived in Gilead in Bashan, and in
its towns, and in all the suburbs of Sharon, as far as their borders.

<span id="an_5:17">5:17</span> All these were reckoned by genealogies in
the days of Jotham king of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam king of
Israel.

<span id="an_5:18">5:18</span> The sons of Reuben, and the Gadites, and
the half-tribe of Manasseh, of valiant men, men able to bear buckler and
sword, and to shoot with bow, and skillful in war, were forty-four
thousand seven hundred and sixty, that were able to go forth to war.

<span id="an_5:19">5:19</span> They made war with the Hagrites, with
Jetur, and Naphish, and Nodab.

<span id="an_5:20">5:20</span> They were helped against them, and the
Hagrites were delivered into their hand, and all who were with them; for
they cried to God in the battle, and he was entreated of them, because
they put their trust in him.

<span id="an_5:21">5:21</span> They took away their livestock; of their
camels fifty thousand, and of sheep two hundred fifty thousand, and of
donkeys two thousand, and of men one hundred thousand.

<span id="an_5:22">5:22</span> For there fell many slain, because the
war was of God. They lived in their place until the captivity.

<span id="an_5:23">5:23</span> The children of the half-tribe of
Manasseh lived in the land: they increased from Bashan to Baal Hermon
and Senir and Mount Hermon.

<span id="an_5:24">5:24</span> These were the heads of their fathers'
houses: even Epher, and Ishi, and Eliel, and Azriel, and Jeremiah, and
Hodaviah, and Jahdiel, mighty men of valor, famous men, heads of their
fathers' houses.

<span id="an_5:25">5:25</span> They trespassed against the God of their
fathers, and played the prostitute after the gods of the peoples of the
land, whom God destroyed before them.

<span id="an_5:26">5:26</span> The God of Israel stirred up the spirit
of Pul king of Assyria, and the spirit of Tilgath Pilneser king of
Assyria, and he carried them away, even the Reubenites, and the Gadites,
and the half-tribe of Manasseh, and brought them to Halah, and Habor,
and Hara, and to the river of Gozan, to this day.

<span id="an_8:5">8:5</span> and Gera, and Shephuphan, and Huram.

<span id="an_8:6">8:6</span> These are the sons of Ehud: these are the
heads of fathers' \[houses\] of the inhabitants of Geba, and they
carried them captive to Manahath:

<span id="an_8:7">8:7</span> and Naaman, and Ahijah, and Gera, he
carried them captive: and he became the father of Uzza and Ahihud.

<span id="an_8:8">8:8</span> Shaharaim became the father of children in
the field of Moab, after he had sent them away; Hushim and Baara were
his wives.

<span id="an_8:9">8:9</span> He became the father of Hodesh his wife,
Jobab, and Zibia, and Mesha, and Malcam,

<span id="an_8:10">8:10</span> and Jeuz, and Shachia, and Mirmah. These
were his sons, heads of fathers' \[houses\].

<span id="an_8:11">8:11</span> Of Hushim he became the father of Abitub
and Elpaal.

<span id="an_8:12">8:12</span> The sons of Elpaal: Eber, and Misham, and
Shemed, who built Ono and Lod, with its towns;

<span id="an_8:13">8:13</span> and Beriah, and Shema, who were heads of
fathers' \[houses\] of the inhabitants of Aijalon, who put to flight the
inhabitants of Gath;

<span id="an_8:14">8:14</span> and Ahio, Shashak, and Jeremoth,

<span id="an_8:15">8:15</span> and Zebadiah, and Arad, and Eder,

<span id="an_8:16">8:16</span> and Michael, and Ishpah, and Joha, the
sons of Beriah,

<span id="an_8:17">8:17</span> and Zebadiah, and Meshullam, and Hizki,
and Heber,

<span id="an_8:18">8:18</span> and Ishmerai, and Izliah, and Jobab, the
sons of Elpaal,

<span id="an_8:21">8:21</span> and Adaiah, and Beraiah, and Shimrath,
the sons of Shimei,

<span id="an_8:22">8:22</span> and Ishpan, and Eber, and Eliel,

<span id="an_8:23">8:23</span> and Abdon, and Zichri, and Hanan,

<span id="an_8:24">8:24</span> and Hananiah, and Elam, and Anthothijah,

Shashak,

Athaliah,

<span id="an_8:27">8:27</span> and Jaareshiah, and Elijah, and Zichri,
the sons of Jeroham.

<span id="an_8:28">8:28</span> These were heads of fathers' \[houses\]
throughout their generations, chief men: these lived in Jerusalem.

<span id="an_8:29">8:29</span> In Gibeon there lived the father of
Gibeon, \[Jeiel\], whose wife's name was Maacah;

<span id="an_8:30">8:30</span> and his firstborn son Abdon, and Zur, and
Kish, and Baal, and Nadab,

<span id="an_8:31">8:31</span> and Gedor, and Ahio, and Zecher.

<span id="an_8:32">8:32</span> Mikloth became the father of Shimeah.
They also lived with their brothers in Jerusalem, over against their
brothers.

<span id="an_8:33">8:33</span> Ner became the father of Kish; and Kish
became the father of Saul; and Saul became the father of Jonathan, and
Malchishua, and Abinadab, and Eshbaal.

<span id="an_8:34">8:34</span> The son of Jonathan was Merib Baal; and
Merib Baal became the father of Micah.

<span id="an_8:35">8:35</span> The sons of Micah: Pithon, and Melech,
and Tarea, and Ahaz.

<span id="an_8:36">8:36</span> Ahaz became the father of Jehoaddah; and
Jehoaddah became the father of Alemeth, and Azmaveth, and Zimri; and
Zimri became the father of Moza.

<span id="an_8:37">8:37</span> Moza became the father of Binea; Raphah
was his son, Eleasah his son, Azel his son.

<span id="an_8:38">8:38</span> Azel had six sons, whose names are these:
Azrikam, Bocheru, and Ishmael, and Sheariah, and Obadiah, and Hanan. All
these were the sons of Azel.

<span id="an_8:39">8:39</span> The sons of Eshek his brother: Ulam his
firstborn, Jeush the second, and Eliphelet the third.

<span id="an_8:40">8:40</span> The sons of Ulam were mighty men of
valor, archers, and had many sons, and sons' sons, one hundred fifty.
All these were of the sons of Benjamin.

<span id="an_9:1">9:1</span> So all Israel were reckoned by genealogies;
and behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel: and
Judah was carried away captive to Babylon for their disobedience.

<span id="an_9:2">9:2</span> Now the first inhabitants who lived in
their possessions in their cities were Israel, the priests, the Levites,
and the Nethinim.

<span id="an_9:3">9:3</span> In Jerusalem lived of the children of
Judah, and of the children of Benjamin, and of the children of Ephraim
and Manasseh:

<span id="an_9:4">9:4</span> Uthai the son of Ammihud, the son of Omri,
the son of Imri, the son of Bani, of the children of Perez the son of
Judah.

<span id="an_9:5">9:5</span> Of the Shilonites: Asaiah the firstborn,
and his sons.

<span id="an_9:6">9:6</span> Of the sons of Zerah: Jeuel, and their
brothers, six hundred ninety.

<span id="an_9:7">9:7</span> Of the sons of Benjamin: Sallu the son of
Meshullam, the son of Hodaviah, the son of Hassenuah,

<span id="an_9:8">9:8</span> and Ibneiah the son of Jeroham, and Elah
the son of Uzzi, the son of Michri, and Meshullam the son of Shephatiah,
the son of Reuel, the son of Ibnijah;

<span id="an_9:9">9:9</span> and their brothers, according to their
generations, nine hundred fifty-six. All these men were heads of
fathers' \[houses\] by their fathers' houses.

<span id="an_9:10">9:10</span> Of the priests: Jedaiah, and Jehoiarib,
Jachin,

<span id="an_9:11">9:11</span> and Azariah the son of Hilkiah, the son
of Meshullam, the son of Zadok, the son of Meraioth, the son of Ahitub,
the ruler of the house of God;

<span id="an_9:12">9:12</span> and Adaiah the son of Jeroham, the son of
Pashhur, the son of Malchijah, and Maasai the son of Adiel, the son of
Jahzerah, the son of Meshullam, the son of Meshillemith, the son of
Immer;

<span id="an_9:13">9:13</span> and their brothers, heads of their
fathers' houses, one thousand seven hundred sixty; very able men for the
work of the service of the house of God.

<span id="an_9:14">9:14</span> Of the Levites: Shemaiah the son of
Hasshub, the son of Azrikam, the son of Hashabiah, of the sons of
Merari;

<span id="an_9:15">9:15</span> and Bakbakkar, Heresh, and Galal, and
Mattaniah the son of Mica, the son of Zichri, the son of Asaph,

<span id="an_9:16">9:16</span> and Obadiah the son of Shemaiah, the son
of Galal, the son of Jeduthun, and Berechiah the son of Asa, the son of
Elkanah, who lived in the villages of the Netophathites.

<span id="an_9:17">9:17</span> The porters: Shallum, and Akkub, and
Talmon, and Ahiman, and their brothers (Shallum was the chief),

<span id="an_9:18">9:18</span> who hitherto \[waited\] in the king's
gate eastward: they were the porters for the camp of the children of
Levi.

<span id="an_9:19">9:19</span> Shallum the son of Kore, the son of
Ebiasaph, the son of Korah, and his brothers, of his father's house, the
Korahites, were over the work of the service, keepers of the thresholds
of the tent: and their fathers had been over the camp of Yahweh, keepers
of the entry.

<span id="an_9:20">9:20</span> Phinehas the son of Eleazar was ruler
over them in time past, \[and\] Yahweh was with him.

<span id="an_9:21">9:21</span> Zechariah the son of Meshelemiah was
porter of the door of the Tent of Meeting.

<span id="an_9:22">9:22</span> All these who were chosen to be porters
in the thresholds were two hundred and twelve. These were reckoned by
genealogy in their villages, whom David and Samuel the seer did ordain
in their office of trust.

<span id="an_9:23">9:23</span> So they and their children had the
oversight of the gates of the house of Yahweh, even the house of the
tent, by wards.

<span id="an_9:24">9:24</span> On the four sides were the porters,
toward the east, west, north, and south.

<span id="an_9:25">9:25</span> Their brothers, in their villages, were
to come in every seven days from time to time to be with them:

<span id="an_9:26">9:26</span> for the four chief porters, who were
Levites, were in an office of trust, and were over the rooms and over
the treasuries in the house of God.

<span id="an_9:27">9:27</span> They lodged around the house of God,
because that duty was on them; and to them pertained its opening morning
by morning.

<span id="an_9:28">9:28</span> Certain of them were in charge of the
vessels of service; for by count were these brought in and by count were
these taken out.

<span id="an_9:29">9:29</span> Some of them also were appointed over the
furniture, and over all the vessels of the sanctuary, and over the fine
flour, and the wine, and the oil, and the frankincense, and the spices.

<span id="an_9:30">9:30</span> Some of the sons of the priests prepared
the confection of the spices.

<span id="an_9:31">9:31</span> Mattithiah, one of the Levites, who was
the firstborn of Shallum the Korahite, had the office of trust over the
things that were baked in pans.

<span id="an_9:32">9:32</span> Some of their brothers, of the sons of
the Kohathites, were over the show bread, to prepare it every Sabbath.

<span id="an_9:33">9:33</span> These are the singers, heads of fathers'
\[houses\] of the Levites, \[who lived\] in the rooms \[and were\] free
\[from other service\]; for they were employed in their work day and
night.

<span id="an_9:34">9:34</span> These were heads of fathers' \[houses\]
of the Levites, throughout their generations, chief men: these lived at
Jerusalem.

<span id="an_9:35">9:35</span> In Gibeon there lived the father of
Gibeon, Jeiel, whose wife's name was Maacah:

<span id="an_9:36">9:36</span> and his firstborn son Abdon, and Zur, and
Kish, and Baal, and Ner, and Nadab,

<span id="an_9:37">9:37</span> and Gedor, and Ahio, and Zechariah, and
Mikloth.

<span id="an_9:38">9:38</span> Mikloth became the father of Shimeam.
They also lived with their brothers in Jerusalem, over against their
brothers.

<span id="an_9:39">9:39</span> Ner became the father of Kish; and Kish
became the father of Saul; and Saul became the father of Jonathan, and
Malchishua, and Abinadab, and Eshbaal.

<span id="an_9:40">9:40</span> The son of Jonathan was Merib Baal; and
Merib Baal became the father of Micah.

<span id="an_9:41">9:41</span> The sons of Micah: Pithon, and Melech,
and Tahrea, \[and Ahaz\].

<span id="an_9:42">9:42</span> Ahaz became the father of Jarah; and
Jarah became the father of Alemeth, and Azmaveth, and Zimri; and Zimri
became the father of Moza;

<span id="an_9:43">9:43</span> and Moza became the father of Binea; and
Rephaiah his son, Eleasah his son, Azel his son.

<span id="an_9:44">9:44</span> Azel had six sons, whose names are these:
Azrikam, Bocheru, and Ishmael, and Sheariah, and Obadiah, and Hanan:
these were the sons of Azel.

<span id="an_10:1">10:1</span> Now the Philistines fought against
Israel: and the men of Israel fled from before the Philistines, and fell
down slain on Mount Gilboa.

<span id="an_10:2">10:2</span> The Philistines followed hard after Saul
and after his sons; and the Philistines killed Jonathan, and Abinadab,
and Malchishua, the sons of Saul.

<span id="an_10:3">10:3</span> The battle went hard against Saul, and
the archers overtook him; and he was distressed by reason of the
archers.

<span id="an_10:4">10:4</span> Then Saul said to his armor bearer, "Draw
your sword, and thrust me through with it, lest these uncircumcised come
and abuse me." But his armor bearer would not; for he was terrified.
Therefore Saul took his sword, and fell on it.

<span id="an_10:5">10:5</span> When his armor bearer saw that Saul was
dead, he likewise fell on his sword, and died.

<span id="an_10:6">10:6</span> So Saul died, and his three sons; and all
his house died together.

<span id="an_10:7">10:7</span> When all the men of Israel who were in
the valley saw that they fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead,
they forsook their cities, and fled; and the Philistines came and lived
in them.

<span id="an_10:8">10:8</span> It happened on the next day, when the
Philistines came to strip the slain, that they found Saul and his sons
fallen on Mount Gilboa.

<span id="an_10:9">10:9</span> They stripped him, and took his head, and
his armor, and sent into the land of the Philistines all around, to
carry the news to their idols, and to the people.

<span id="an_10:10">10:10</span> They put his armor in the house of
their gods, and fastened his head in the house of Dagon.

<span id="an_10:11">10:11</span> When all Jabesh Gilead heard all that
the Philistines had done to Saul,

<span id="an_10:12">10:12</span> all the valiant men arose, and took
away the body of Saul, and the bodies of his sons, and brought them to
Jabesh, and buried their bones under the oak in Jabesh, and fasted seven
days.

<span id="an_10:13">10:13</span> So Saul died for his trespass which he
committed against Yahweh, because of the word of Yahweh, which he didn't
keep; and also because he asked counsel of one who had a familiar
spirit, to inquire \[thereby\],

<span id="an_10:14">10:14</span> and didn't inquire of Yahweh: therefore
he killed him, and turned the kingdom to David the son of Jesse.

<span id="an_11:1">11:1</span> Then all Israel gathered themselves to
David to Hebron, saying, "Behold, we are your bone and your flesh.

<span id="an_11:2">11:2</span> In times past, even when Saul was king,
it was you who led out and brought in Israel. Yahweh your God said to
you, 'You shall be shepherd of my people Israel, and you shall be prince
over my people Israel.'"

<span id="an_11:3">11:3</span> So all the elders of Israel came to the
king to Hebron; and David made a covenant with them in Hebron before
Yahweh; and they anointed David king over Israel, according to the word
of Yahweh by Samuel.

<span id="an_11:4">11:4</span> David and all Israel went to Jerusalem
(the same is Jebus); and the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land,
were there.

<span id="an_11:5">11:5</span> The inhabitants of Jebus said to David,
"You shall not come in here." Nevertheless David took the stronghold of
Zion. The same is the city of David.

<span id="an_11:6">11:6</span> David said, "Whoever strikes the
Jebusites first shall be chief and captain." Joab the son of Zeruiah
went up first, and was made chief.

<span id="an_11:7">11:7</span> David lived in the stronghold; therefore
they called it the city of David.

<span id="an_11:8">11:8</span> He built the city all around, from Millo
even around; and Joab repaired the rest of the city.

<span id="an_11:9">11:9</span> David grew greater and greater; for
Yahweh of Armies was with him.

<span id="an_11:10">11:10</span> Now these are the chief of the mighty
men whom David had, who showed themselves strong with him in his
kingdom, together with all Israel, to make him king, according to the
word of Yahweh concerning Israel.

<span id="an_11:11">11:11</span> This is the number of the mighty men
whom David had: Jashobeam, the son of a Hachmonite, the chief of the
thirty; he lifted up his spear against three hundred and killed them at
one time.

<span id="an_11:12">11:12</span> After him was Eleazar the son of Dodo,
the Ahohite, who was one of the three mighty men.

<span id="an_11:13">11:13</span> He was with David at Pasdammim, and
there the Philistines were gathered together to battle, where there was
a plot of ground full of barley; and the people fled from before the
Philistines.

<span id="an_11:14">11:14</span> They stood in the midst of the plot,
and defended it, and killed the Philistines; and Yahweh saved them by a
great victory.

<span id="an_11:15">11:15</span> Three of the thirty chief men went down
to the rock to David, into the cave of Adullam; and the army of the
Philistines were encamped in the valley of Rephaim.

<span id="an_11:16">11:16</span> David was then in the stronghold, and
the garrison of the Philistines was then in Bethlehem.

<span id="an_11:17">11:17</span> David longed, and said, "Oh that one
would give me water to drink of the well of Bethlehem, which is by the
gate!"

<span id="an_11:18">11:18</span> The three broke through the army of the
Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem, that was by
the gate, and took it, and brought it to David: but David would not
drink of it, but poured it out to Yahweh,

<span id="an_11:19">11:19</span> and said, "My God forbid it me, that I
should do this! Shall I drink the blood of these men who have put their
lives in jeopardy?" For they risked their lives to bring it. Therefore
he would not drink it. The three mighty men did these things.

<span id="an_11:20">11:20</span> Abishai, the brother of Joab, he was
chief of the three; for he lifted up his spear against three hundred and
killed them, and had a name among the three.

<span id="an_11:21">11:21</span> Of the three, he was more honorable
than the two, and was made their captain: however he didn't attain to
the \[first\] three.

<span id="an_11:22">11:22</span> Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of
a valiant man of Kabzeel, who had done mighty deeds, he killed the two
\[sons of\] Ariel of Moab: he went down also and killed a lion in the
midst of a pit in time of snow.

<span id="an_11:23">11:23</span> He killed an Egyptian, a man of great
stature, five cubits high; and in the Egyptian's hand was a spear like a
weaver's beam; and he went down to him with a staff, and plucked the
spear out of the Egyptian's hand, and killed him with his own spear.

<span id="an_11:24">11:24</span> These things did Benaiah the son of
Jehoiada, and had a name among the three mighty men.

<span id="an_11:25">11:25</span> Behold, he was more honorable than the
thirty, but he didn't attain to the \[first\] three: and David set him
over his guard.

<span id="an_11:26">11:26</span> Also the mighty men of the armies:
Asahel the brother of Joab, Elhanan the son of Dodo of Bethlehem,

<span id="an_11:27">11:27</span> Shammoth the Harorite, Helez the
Pelonite,

<span id="an_11:34">11:34</span> the sons of Hashem the Gizonite,
Jonathan the son of Shagee the Hararite,

<span id="an_11:35">11:35</span> Ahiam the son of Sacar the Hararite,
Eliphal the son of Ur,

<span id="an_11:36">11:36</span> Hepher the Mecherathite, Ahijah the
Pelonite,

<span id="an_11:37">11:37</span> Hezro the Carmelite, Naarai the son of
Ezbai,

<span id="an_11:38">11:38</span> Joel the brother of Nathan, Mibhar the
son of Hagri,

<span id="an_11:39">11:39</span> Zelek the Ammonite, Naharai the
Berothite, the armor bearer of Joab the son of Zeruiah,

<span id="an_11:40">11:40</span> Ira the Ithrite, Gareb the Ithrite,

<span id="an_11:41">11:41</span> Uriah the Hittite, Zabad the son of
Ahlai,

<span id="an_11:42">11:42</span> Adina the son of Shiza the Reubenite, a
chief of the Reubenites, and thirty with him,

<span id="an_11:43">11:43</span> Hanan the son of Maacah, and Joshaphat
the Mithnite,

<span id="an_11:44">11:44</span> Uzzia the Ashterathite, Shama and Jeiel
the sons of Hotham the Aroerite,

<span id="an_11:45">11:45</span> Jediael the son of Shimri, and Joha his
brother, the Tizite,

Joshaviah, the sons of Elnaam, and Ithmah the Moabite,

<span id="an_11:47">11:47</span> Eliel, and Obed, and Jaasiel the
Mezobaite.

<span id="an_12:1">12:1</span> Now these are those who came to David to
Ziklag, while he yet kept himself close because of Saul the son of Kish;
and they were among the mighty men, his helpers in war.

<span id="an_12:2">12:2</span> They were armed with bows, and could use
both the right hand and the left in slinging stones and in shooting
arrows from the bow: they were of Saul's brothers of Benjamin.

<span id="an_12:3">12:3</span> The chief was Ahiezer; then Joash, the
sons of Shemaah the Gibeathite, and Jeziel, and Pelet, the sons of
Azmaveth, and Beracah, and Jehu the Anathothite,

<span id="an_12:4">12:4</span> and Ishmaiah the Gibeonite, a mighty man
among the thirty, and over the thirty, and Jeremiah, and Jahaziel, and
Johanan, and Jozabad the Gederathite,

Joezer, and Jashobeam, the Korahites,

<span id="an_12:7">12:7</span> and Joelah, and Zebadiah, the sons of
Jeroham of Gedor.

<span id="an_12:8">12:8</span> Of the Gadites there separated themselves
to David to the stronghold in the wilderness, mighty men of valor, men
trained for war, that could handle shield and spear; whose faces were
like the faces of lions, and they were as swift as the roes on the
mountains;

<span id="an_12:9">12:9</span> Ezer the chief, Obadiah the second, Eliab
the third,

<span id="an_12:10">12:10</span> Mishmannah the fourth, Jeremiah the

<span id="an_12:14">12:14</span> These of the sons of Gad were captains
of the army: he who was least was equal to one hundred, and the greatest
to one thousand.

<span id="an_12:15">12:15</span> These are those who went over the
Jordan in the first month, when it had overflowed all its banks; and
they put to flight all them of the valleys, both toward the east, and
toward the west.

<span id="an_12:16">12:16</span> There came of the children of Benjamin
and Judah to the stronghold to David.

<span id="an_12:17">12:17</span> David went out to meet them, and
answered them, "If you have come peaceably to me to help me, my heart
shall be knit to you; but if you have come to betray me to my
adversaries, since there is no wrong in my hands, may the God of our
fathers look thereon, and rebuke it."

<span id="an_12:18">12:18</span> Then the Spirit came on Amasai, who was
chief of the thirty, \[and he said\], "We are yours, David, and on your
side, you son of Jesse: peace, peace be to you, and peace be to your
helpers; for your God helps you." Then David received them, and made
them captains of the band.

<span id="an_12:19">12:19</span> Of Manasseh also there fell away some
to David, when he came with the Philistines against Saul to battle; but
they didn't help them; for the lords of the Philistines sent him away
after consultation, saying, "He will fall away to his master Saul to the
jeopardy of our heads."

<span id="an_12:20">12:20</span> As he went to Ziklag, there fell to him
of Manasseh, Adnah, and Jozabad, and Jediael, and Michael, and Jozabad,
and Elihu, and Zillethai, captains of thousands who were of Manasseh.

<span id="an_12:21">12:21</span> They helped David against the band of
rovers: for they were all mighty men of valor, and were captains in the
army.

<span id="an_12:22">12:22</span> For from day to day men came to David
to help him, until there was a great army, like the army of God.

<span id="an_12:23">12:23</span> These are the numbers of the heads of
those who were armed for war, who came to David to Hebron, to turn the
kingdom of Saul to him, according to the word of Yahweh.

<span id="an_12:24">12:24</span> The children of Judah who bore shield
and spear were six thousand and eight hundred, armed for war.

<span id="an_12:25">12:25</span> Of the children of Simeon, mighty men
of valor for the war, seven thousand and one hundred.

<span id="an_12:26">12:26</span> Of the children of Levi four thousand
and six hundred.

<span id="an_12:27">12:27</span> Jehoiada was the leader of \[the house
of\] Aaron; and with him were three thousand and seven hundred,

<span id="an_12:28">12:28</span> and Zadok, a young man mighty of valor,
and of his father's house twenty-two captains.

<span id="an_12:29">12:29</span> Of the children of Benjamin, the
brothers of Saul, three thousand: for hitherto the greatest part of them
had kept their allegiance to the house of Saul.

<span id="an_12:30">12:30</span> Of the children of Ephraim twenty
thousand eight hundred, mighty men of valor, famous men in their
fathers' houses.

<span id="an_12:31">12:31</span> Of the half-tribe of Manasseh eighteen
thousand, who were mentioned by name, to come and make David king.

<span id="an_12:32">12:32</span> Of the children of Issachar, men who
had understanding of the times, to know what Israel ought to do, the
heads of them were two hundred; and all their brothers were at their
commandment.

<span id="an_12:33">12:33</span> Of Zebulun, such as were able to go out
in the army, who could set the battle in array, with all kinds of
instruments of war, fifty thousand, and who could order \[the battle
array, and were\] not of double heart.

<span id="an_12:34">12:34</span> Of Naphtali one thousand captains, and
with them with shield and spear thirty-seven thousand.

<span id="an_12:35">12:35</span> Of the Danites who could set the battle
in array, twenty-eight thousand six hundred.

<span id="an_12:36">12:36</span> Of Asher, such as were able to go out
in the army, who could set the battle in array, forty thousand.

<span id="an_12:37">12:37</span> On the other side of the Jordan, of the
Reubenites, and the Gadites, and of the half-tribe of Manasseh, with all
kinds of instruments of war for the battle, one hundred twenty thousand.

<span id="an_12:38">12:38</span> All these being men of war, who could
order the battle array, came with a perfect heart to Hebron, to make
David king over all Israel: and all the rest also of Israel were of one
heart to make David king.

<span id="an_12:39">12:39</span> They were there with David three days,
eating and drinking; for their brothers had made preparation for them.

<span id="an_12:40">12:40</span> Moreover those who were near to them,
\[even\] as far as Issachar and Zebulun and Naphtali, brought bread on
donkeys, and on camels, and on mules, and on oxen, food of meal, cakes
of figs, and clusters of raisins, and wine, and oil, and cattle, and
sheep in abundance: for there was joy in Israel.

<span id="an_13:1">13:1</span> David consulted with the captains of
thousands and of hundreds, even with every leader.

<span id="an_13:2">13:2</span> David said to all the assembly of Israel,
"If it seems good to you, and if it is of Yahweh our God, let us send
abroad everywhere to our brothers who are left in all the land of
Israel, with whom the priests and Levites are in their cities that have
suburbs, that they may gather themselves to us;

<span id="an_13:3">13:3</span> and let us bring again the ark of our God
to us. For we didn't seek it in the days of Saul."

<span id="an_13:4">13:4</span> All the assembly said that they would do
so; for the thing was right in the eyes of all the people.

<span id="an_13:5">13:5</span> So David assembled all Israel together,
from the Shihor \[the brook\] of Egypt even to the entrance of Hamath,
to bring the ark of God from Kiriath Jearim.

<span id="an_13:6">13:6</span> David went up, and all Israel, to Baalah,
\[that is\], to Kiriath Jearim, which belonged to Judah, to bring up
from there the ark of God Yahweh that sits \[above\] the cherubim, that
is called by the Name.

<span id="an_13:7">13:7</span> They carried the ark of God on a new
cart, \[and brought it\] out of the house of Abinadab: and Uzza and Ahio
drove the cart.

<span id="an_13:8">13:8</span> David and all Israel played before God
with all their might, even with songs, and with harps, and with stringed
instruments, and with tambourines, and with cymbals, and with trumpets.

<span id="an_13:9">13:9</span> When they came to the threshing floor of
Chidon, Uzza put forth his hand to hold the ark; for the oxen stumbled.

<span id="an_13:10">13:10</span> The anger of Yahweh was kindled against
Uzza, and he struck him, because he put forth his hand to the ark; and
there he died before God.

<span id="an_13:11">13:11</span> David was displeased, because Yahweh
had broken forth on Uzza; and he called that place Perez Uzza, to this
day.

<span id="an_13:12">13:12</span> David was afraid of God that day,
saying, "How shall I bring the ark of God home to me?"

<span id="an_13:13">13:13</span> So David didn't move the ark to him
into the city of David, but carried it aside into the house of Obed-Edom
the Gittite.

<span id="an_13:14">13:14</span> The ark of God remained with the family
of Obed-Edom in his house three months: and Yahweh blessed the house of
Obed-Edom, and all that he had.

<span id="an_14:1">14:1</span> Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to
David, and cedar trees, and masons, and carpenters, to build him a
house.

<span id="an_14:2">14:2</span> David perceived that Yahweh had
established him king over Israel; for his kingdom was exalted on high,
for his people Israel's sake.

<span id="an_14:3">14:3</span> David took more wives at Jerusalem; and
David became the father of more sons and daughters.

<span id="an_14:4">14:4</span> These are the names of the children whom
he had in Jerusalem: Shammua, and Shobab, Nathan, and Solomon,

<span id="an_14:5">14:5</span> and Ibhar, and Elishua, and Elpelet,

<span id="an_14:6">14:6</span> and Nogah, and Nepheg, and Japhia,

<span id="an_14:7">14:7</span> and Elishama, and Beeliada, and
Eliphelet.

<span id="an_14:8">14:8</span> When the Philistines heard that David was
anointed king over all Israel, all the Philistines went up to seek
David: and David heard of it, and went out against them.

<span id="an_14:9">14:9</span> Now the Philistines had come and made a
raid in the valley of Rephaim.

<span id="an_14:10">14:10</span> David inquired of God, saying, "Shall I
go up against the Philistines? Will you deliver them into my hand?"
Yahweh said to him, "Go up; for I will deliver them into your hand."

<span id="an_14:11">14:11</span> So they came up to Baal Perazim, and
David struck them there; and David said, God has broken my enemies by my
hand, like the breach of waters. Therefore they called the name of that
place Baal Perazim.

<span id="an_14:12">14:12</span> They left their gods there; and David
gave commandment, and they were burned with fire.

<span id="an_14:13">14:13</span> The Philistines yet again made a raid
in the valley.

<span id="an_14:14">14:14</span> David inquired again of God; and God
said to him, "You shall not go up after them. Turn away from them, and
come on them over against the mulberry trees.

<span id="an_14:15">14:15</span> It shall be, when you hear the sound of
marching in the tops of the mulberry trees, that then you shall go out
to battle; for God has gone out before you to strike the army of the
Philistines."

<span id="an_14:16">14:16</span> David did as God commanded him: and
they struck the army of the Philistines from Gibeon even to Gezer.

<span id="an_14:17">14:17</span> The fame of David went out into all
lands; and Yahweh brought the fear of him on all nations.

<span id="an_15:1">15:1</span> \[David\] made him houses in the city of
David; and he prepared a place for the ark of God, and pitched for it a
tent.

<span id="an_15:2">15:2</span> Then David said, "No one ought to carry
the ark of God but the Levites. For Yahweh has chosen them to carry the
ark of God, and to minister to him forever."

<span id="an_15:3">15:3</span> David assembled all Israel at Jerusalem,
to bring up the ark of Yahweh to its place, which he had prepared for
it.

<span id="an_15:4">15:4</span> David gathered together the sons of
Aaron, and the Levites:

<span id="an_15:5">15:5</span> of the sons of Kohath, Uriel the chief,
and his brothers one hundred twenty;

<span id="an_15:6">15:6</span> of the sons of Merari, Asaiah the chief,
and his brothers two hundred twenty;

<span id="an_15:7">15:7</span> of the sons of Gershom, Joel the chief,
and his brothers one hundred thirty;

<span id="an_15:8">15:8</span> of the sons of Elizaphan, Shemaiah the
chief, and his brothers two hundred;

<span id="an_15:9">15:9</span> of the sons of Hebron, Eliel the chief,
and his brothers eighty;

<span id="an_15:10">15:10</span> of the sons of Uzziel, Amminadab the
chief, and his brothers one hundred twelve.

<span id="an_15:11">15:11</span> David called for Zadok and Abiathar the
priests, and for the Levites, for Uriel, Asaiah, and Joel, Shemaiah, and
Eliel, and Amminadab,

<span id="an_15:12">15:12</span> and said to them, "You are the heads of
the fathers' \[houses\] of the Levites. Sanctify yourselves, both you
and your brothers, that you may bring up the ark of Yahweh, the God of
Israel, to the place that I have prepared for it.

<span id="an_15:13">15:13</span> For because you didn't carry it at
first, Yahweh our God made broke out against us, because we didn't seek
him according to the ordinance."

<span id="an_15:14">15:14</span> So the priests and the Levites
sanctified themselves to bring up the ark of Yahweh, the God of Israel.

<span id="an_15:15">15:15</span> The children of the Levites bore the
ark of God on their shoulders with the poles thereon, as Moses commanded
according to the word of Yahweh.

<span id="an_15:16">15:16</span> David spoke to the chief of the Levites
to appoint their brothers the singers, with instruments of music,
stringed instruments and harps and cymbals, sounding aloud and lifting
up the voice with joy.

<span id="an_15:17">15:17</span> So the Levites appointed Heman the son
of Joel; and of his brothers, Asaph the son of Berechiah; and of the
sons of Merari their brothers, Ethan the son of Kushaiah;

<span id="an_15:18">15:18</span> and with them their brothers of the
second degree, Zechariah, Ben, and Jaaziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel,
and Unni, Eliab, and Benaiah, and Maaseiah, and Mattithiah, and
Eliphelehu, and Mikneiah, and Obed-Edom, and Jeiel, the doorkeepers.

<span id="an_15:19">15:19</span> So the singers, Heman, Asaph, and
Ethan, \[were appointed\] with cymbals of brass to sound aloud;

<span id="an_15:20">15:20</span> and Zechariah, and Aziel, and
Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, and Eliab, and Maaseiah, and Benaiah,
with stringed instruments set to Alamoth;

<span id="an_15:21">15:21</span> and Mattithiah, and Eliphelehu, and
Mikneiah, and Obed-Edom, and Jeiel, and Azaziah, with harps tuned to the
eight-stringed lyre, to lead.

<span id="an_15:22">15:22</span> Chenaniah, chief of the Levites, was
over the song: he instructed about the song, because he was skillful.

<span id="an_15:23">15:23</span> Berechiah and Elkanah were doorkeepers
for the ark.

<span id="an_15:24">15:24</span> Shebaniah, and Joshaphat, and Nethanel,
and Amasai, and Zechariah, and Benaiah, and Eliezer, the priests, did
blow the trumpets before the ark of God: and Obed-Edom and Jehiah were
doorkeepers for the ark.

<span id="an_15:25">15:25</span> So David, and the elders of Israel, and
the captains over thousands, went to bring up the ark of the covenant of
Yahweh out of the house of Obed-Edom with joy.

<span id="an_15:26">15:26</span> It happened, when God helped the
Levites who bore the ark of the covenant of Yahweh, that they sacrificed
seven bulls and seven rams.

<span id="an_15:27">15:27</span> David was clothed with a robe of fine
linen, and all the Levites who bore the ark, and the singers, and
Chenaniah the master of the song \[with\] the singers: and David had on
him an ephod of linen.

<span id="an_15:28">15:28</span> Thus all Israel brought up the ark of
the covenant of Yahweh with shouting, and with sound of the cornet, and
with trumpets, and with cymbals, sounding aloud with stringed
instruments and harps.

<span id="an_15:29">15:29</span> It happened, as the ark of the covenant
of Yahweh came to the city of David, that Michal the daughter of Saul
looked out at the window, and saw king David dancing and playing; and
she despised him in her heart.

<span id="an_16:1">16:1</span> They brought in the ark of God, and set
it in the midst of the tent that David had pitched for it: and they
offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before God.

<span id="an_16:2">16:2</span> When David had made an end of offering
the burnt offering and the peace offerings, he blessed the people in the
name of Yahweh.

<span id="an_16:3">16:3</span> He dealt to everyone of Israel, both man
and woman, to every one a loaf of bread, and a portion \[of flesh\], and
a cake of raisins.

<span id="an_16:4">16:4</span> He appointed certain of the Levites to
minister before the ark of Yahweh, and to celebrate and to thank and
praise Yahweh, the God of Israel:

<span id="an_16:5">16:5</span> Asaph the chief, and second to him
Zechariah, Jeiel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Mattithiah, and
Eliab, and Benaiah, and Obed-Edom, and Jeiel, with stringed instruments
and with harps; and Asaph with cymbals, sounding aloud;

<span id="an_16:6">16:6</span> and Benaiah and Jahaziel the priests with
trumpets continually, before the ark of the covenant of God.

<span id="an_16:7">16:7</span> Then on that day David first ordained to
give thanks to Yahweh, by the hand of Asaph and his brothers.

<span id="an_16:8">16:8</span> Oh give thanks to Yahweh. Call on his
name. Make his doings known among the peoples.

<span id="an_16:9">16:9</span> Sing to him. Sing praises to him. Tell of
all his marvelous works.

<span id="an_16:10">16:10</span> Glory in his holy name. Let the heart
of those who seek Yahweh rejoice.

<span id="an_16:11">16:11</span> Seek Yahweh and his strength. Seek his
face forever more.

<span id="an_16:12">16:12</span> Remember his marvelous works that he
has done, his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth,

<span id="an_16:13">16:13</span> you seed of Israel his servant, you
children of Jacob, his chosen ones.

<span id="an_16:14">16:14</span> He is Yahweh our God. His judgments are
in all the earth.

<span id="an_16:15">16:15</span> Remember his covenant forever, the word
which he commanded to a thousand generations,

<span id="an_16:16">16:16</span> \[the covenant\] which he made with
Abraham, his oath to Isaac.

<span id="an_16:17">16:17</span> He confirmed the same to Jacob for a
statute, and to Israel for an everlasting covenant,

<span id="an_16:18">16:18</span> saying, "I will give you the land of
Canaan, The lot of your inheritance,"

<span id="an_16:19">16:19</span> when you were but a few men in number,
yes, very few, and foreigners were in it.

<span id="an_16:20">16:20</span> They went about from nation to nation,
from one kingdom to another people.

<span id="an_16:21">16:21</span> He allowed no man to do them wrong.
Yes, he reproved kings for their sakes,

<span id="an_16:22">16:22</span> "Don't touch my anointed ones! Do my
prophets no harm!"

<span id="an_16:23">16:23</span> Sing to Yahweh, all the earth! Display
his salvation from day to day.

<span id="an_16:24">16:24</span> Declare his glory among the nations,
and his marvelous works among all the peoples.

<span id="an_16:25">16:25</span> For great is Yahweh, and greatly to be
praised. He also is to be feared above all gods.

<span id="an_16:26">16:26</span> For all the gods of the peoples are
idols, but Yahweh made the heavens.

<span id="an_16:27">16:27</span> Honor and majesty are before him.
Strength and gladness are in his place.

<span id="an_16:28">16:28</span> Ascribe to Yahweh, you relatives of the
peoples, ascribe to Yahweh glory and strength!

<span id="an_16:29">16:29</span> Ascribe to Yahweh the glory due to his
name. Bring an offering, and come before him. Worship Yahweh in holy
array.

<span id="an_16:30">16:30</span> Tremble before him, all the earth. The
world also is established that it can't be moved.

<span id="an_16:31">16:31</span> Let the heavens be glad, and let the
earth rejoice! Let them say among the nations, "Yahweh reigns!"

<span id="an_16:32">16:32</span> Let the sea roar, and its fullness! Let
the field exult, and all that is therein!

<span id="an_16:33">16:33</span> Then the trees of the forest will sing
for joy before Yahweh, for he comes to judge the earth.

<span id="an_16:34">16:34</span> Oh give thanks to Yahweh, for he is
good, for his loving kindness endures forever.

<span id="an_16:35">16:35</span> Say, "Save us, God of our salvation!
Gather us together and deliver us from the nations, to give thanks to
your holy name, to triumph in your praise."

<span id="an_16:36">16:36</span> Blessed be Yahweh, the God of Israel,
from everlasting even to everlasting. All the people said, "Amen," and
praised Yahweh.

<span id="an_16:37">16:37</span> So he left there, before the ark of the
covenant of Yahweh, Asaph and his brothers, to minister before the ark
continually, as every day's work required;

<span id="an_16:38">16:38</span> and Obed-Edom with their brothers,
sixty-eight; Obed-Edom also the son of Jeduthun and Hosah to be
doorkeepers;

<span id="an_16:39">16:39</span> and Zadok the priest, and his brothers
the priests, before the tabernacle of Yahweh in the high place that was
at Gibeon,

<span id="an_16:40">16:40</span> to offer burnt offerings to Yahweh on
the altar of burnt offering continually morning and evening, even
according to all that is written in the law of Yahweh, which he
commanded to Israel;

<span id="an_16:41">16:41</span> and with them Heman and Jeduthun, and
the rest who were chosen, who were mentioned by name, to give thanks to
Yahweh, because his loving kindness endures forever;

<span id="an_16:42">16:42</span> and with them Heman and Jeduthun
\[with\] trumpets and cymbals for those that should sound aloud, and
\[with\] instruments for the songs of God; and the sons of Jeduthun to
be at the gate.

<span id="an_16:43">16:43</span> All the people departed every man to
his house: and David returned to bless his house.

<span id="an_17:1">17:1</span> It happened, when David lived in his
house, that David said to Nathan the prophet, "Behold, I dwell in a
house of cedar, but the ark of the covenant of Yahweh is under
curtains."

<span id="an_17:2">17:2</span> Nathan said to David, "Do all that is in
your heart; for God is with you."

<span id="an_17:3">17:3</span> It happened the same night, that the word
of God came to Nathan, saying,

<span id="an_17:4">17:4</span> "Go and tell David my servant, 'Thus says
Yahweh, "You shall not build me a house to dwell in;

<span id="an_17:5">17:5</span> for I have not lived in a house since the
day that I brought up Israel, to this day, but have gone from tent to
tent, and from one tent to another.

<span id="an_17:6">17:6</span> In all places in which I have walked with
all Israel, did I speak a word with any of the judges of Israel, whom I
commanded to be shepherd of my people, saying, 'Why have you not built
me a house of cedar?'"'

<span id="an_17:7">17:7</span> "Now therefore, you shall tell my servant
David, 'Thus says Yahweh of Armies, "I took you from the sheep pen, from
following the sheep, that you should be prince over my people Israel.

<span id="an_17:8">17:8</span> I have been with you wherever you have
gone, and have cut off all your enemies from before you. I will make you
a name, like the name of the great ones who are in the earth.

<span id="an_17:9">17:9</span> I will appoint a place for my people
Israel, and will plant them, that they may dwell in their own place, and
be moved no more; neither shall the children of wickedness waste them
any more, as at the first,

<span id="an_17:10">17:10</span> and from the day that I commanded
judges to be over my people Israel; and I will subdue all your enemies.
Moreover I tell you that Yahweh will build you a house.

<span id="an_17:11">17:11</span> It shall happen, when your days are
fulfilled that you must go to be with your fathers, that I will set up
your seed after you, who shall be of your sons; and I will establish his
kingdom.

<span id="an_17:12">17:12</span> He shall build me a house, and I will
establish his throne forever.

<span id="an_17:13">17:13</span> I will be his father, and he shall be
my son. I will not take my loving kindness away from him, as I took it
from him that was before you;

<span id="an_17:14">17:14</span> but I will settle him in my house and
in my kingdom forever. His throne shall be established forever."'"

<span id="an_17:15">17:15</span> According to all these words, and
according to all this vision, so Nathan spoke to David.

<span id="an_17:16">17:16</span> Then David the king went in, and sat
before Yahweh; and he said, "Who am I, Yahweh God, and what is my house,
that you have brought me thus far?

<span id="an_17:17">17:17</span> This was a small thing in your eyes,
God; but you have spoken of your servant's house for a great while to
come, and have respected me according to the estate of a man of high
degree, Yahweh God.

<span id="an_17:18">17:18</span> What can David say yet more to you
concerning the honor which is done to your servant? For you know your
servant.

<span id="an_17:19">17:19</span> Yahweh, for your servant's sake, and
according to your own heart, you have worked all this greatness, to make
known all these great things.

<span id="an_17:20">17:20</span> Yahweh, there is none like you, neither
is there any God besides you, according to all that we have heard with
our ears.

<span id="an_17:21">17:21</span> What one nation in the earth is like
your people Israel, whom God went to redeem to himself for a people, to
make you a name by great and awesome things, in driving out nations from
before your people, whom you redeem out of Egypt?

<span id="an_17:22">17:22</span> For your people Israel you made your
own people forever; and you, Yahweh, became their God.

<span id="an_17:23">17:23</span> Now, Yahweh, let the word that you have
spoken concerning your servant, and concerning his house, be established
forever, and do as you have spoken.

<span id="an_17:24">17:24</span> Let your name be established and
magnified forever, saying, 'Yahweh of Armies is the God of Israel, even
a God to Israel. The house of David your servant is established before
you.'

<span id="an_17:25">17:25</span> For you, my God, have revealed to your
servant that you will build him a house. Therefore your servant has
found courage to pray before you.

<span id="an_17:26">17:26</span> Now, Yahweh, you are God, and have
promised this good thing to your servant.

<span id="an_17:27">17:27</span> Now it has pleased you to bless the
house of your servant, that it may continue forever before you; for you,
Yahweh, have blessed, and it is blessed forever."

<span id="an_18:1">18:1</span> After this it happened, that David struck
the Philistines, and subdued them, and took Gath and its towns out of
the hand of the Philistines.

<span id="an_18:2">18:2</span> He struck Moab; and the Moabites became
servants to David, and brought tribute.

<span id="an_18:3">18:3</span> David struck Hadadezer king of Zobah to
Hamath, as he went to establish his dominion by the river Euphrates.

<span id="an_18:4">18:4</span> David took from him one thousand
chariots, and seven thousand horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen; and
David hamstrung all the chariot horses, but reserved of them for one
hundred chariots.

<span id="an_18:5">18:5</span> When the Syrians of Damascus came to help
Hadadezer king of Zobah, David struck of the Syrians twenty-two thousand
men.

<span id="an_18:6">18:6</span> Then David put \[garrisons\] in Syria of
Damascus; and the Syrians became servants to David, and brought tribute.
Yahweh gave victory to David wherever he went.

<span id="an_18:7">18:7</span> David took the shields of gold that were
on the servants of Hadadezer, and brought them to Jerusalem.

<span id="an_18:8">18:8</span> From Tibhath and from Cun, cities of
Hadadezer, David took very much brass, with which Solomon made the
bronze sea, and the pillars, and the vessels of brass.

<span id="an_18:9">18:9</span> When Tou king of Hamath heard that David
had struck all the army of Hadadezer king of Zobah,

<span id="an_18:10">18:10</span> he sent Hadoram his son to king David,
to Greet him, and to bless him, because he had fought against Hadadezer
and struck him; (for Hadadezer had wars with Tou;) and \[he had with
him\] all kinds of vessels of gold and silver and brass.

<span id="an_18:11">18:11</span> These also did king David dedicate to
Yahweh, with the silver and the gold that he carried away from all the
nations; from Edom, and from Moab, and from the children of Ammon, and
from the Philistines, and from Amalek.

<span id="an_18:12">18:12</span> Moreover Abishai the son of Zeruiah
struck of the Edomites in the Valley of Salt eighteen thousand.

<span id="an_18:13">18:13</span> He put garrisons in Edom; and all the
Edomites became servants to David. Yahweh gave victory to David wherever
he went.

<span id="an_18:14">18:14</span> David reigned over all Israel; and he
executed justice and righteousness to all his people.

<span id="an_18:15">18:15</span> Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the
army; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was recorder;

<span id="an_18:16">18:16</span> and Zadok the son of Ahitub, and
Abimelech the son of Abiathar, were priests; and Shavsha was scribe;

<span id="an_18:17">18:17</span> and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was
over the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and the sons of David were
chief about the king.

<span id="an_19:1">19:1</span> It happened after this, that Nahash the
king of the children of Ammon died, and his son reigned in his place.

<span id="an_19:2">19:2</span> David said, "I will show kindness to
Hanun the son of Nahash, because his father showed kindness to me." So
David sent messengers to comfort him concerning his father. David's
servants came into the land of the children of Ammon to Hanun, to
comfort him.

<span id="an_19:3">19:3</span> But the princes of the children of Ammon
said to Hanun, "Do you think that David honors your father, in that he
has sent comforters to you? Haven't his servants come to you to search,
to overthrow, and to spy out the land?"

<span id="an_19:4">19:4</span> So Hanun took David's servants, and
shaved them, and cut off their garments in the middle, even to their
buttocks, and sent them away.

<span id="an_19:5">19:5</span> Then there went certain persons, and told
David how the men were served. He sent to meet them; for the men were
greatly ashamed. The king said, "Stay at Jericho until your beards have
grown, and then return."

<span id="an_19:6">19:6</span> When the children of Ammon saw that they
had made themselves odious to David, Hanun and the children of Ammon
sent one thousand talents of silver to hire them chariots and horsemen
out of Mesopotamia, and out of Arammaacah, and out of Zobah.

<span id="an_19:7">19:7</span> So they hired for themselves thirty-two
thousand chariots, and the king of Maacah and his people, who came and
encamped before Medeba. The children of Ammon gathered themselves
together from their cities, and came to battle.

<span id="an_19:8">19:8</span> When David heard of it, he sent Joab, and
all the army of the mighty men.

<span id="an_19:9">19:9</span> The children of Ammon came out, and put
the battle in array at the gate of the city: and the kings who had come
were by themselves in the field.

<span id="an_19:10">19:10</span> Now when Joab saw that the battle was
set against him before and behind, he chose of all the choice men of
Israel, and put them in array against the Syrians.

<span id="an_19:11">19:11</span> The rest of the people he committed
into the hand of Abishai his brother; and they put themselves in array
against the children of Ammon.

<span id="an_19:12">19:12</span> He said, "If the Syrians are too strong
for me, then you are to help me; but if the children of Ammon are too
strong for you, then I will help you.

<span id="an_19:13">19:13</span> Be courageous, and let us be strong for
our people, and for the cities of our God. May Yahweh do that which
seems good to him."

<span id="an_19:14">19:14</span> So Joab and the people who were with
him drew near before the Syrians to the battle; and they fled before
him.

<span id="an_19:15">19:15</span> When the children of Ammon saw that the
Syrians had fled, they likewise fled before Abishai his brother, and
entered into the city. Then Joab came to Jerusalem.

<span id="an_19:16">19:16</span> When the Syrians saw that they were
defeated by Israel, they sent messengers, and drew forth the Syrians who
were beyond the River, with Shophach the captain of the army of
Hadadezer at their head.

<span id="an_19:17">19:17</span> It was told David; and he gathered all
Israel together, and passed over the Jordan, and came on them, and set
the battle in array against them. So when David had put the battle in
array against the Syrians, they fought with him.

<span id="an_19:18">19:18</span> The Syrians fled before Israel; and
David killed of the Syrians \[the men of\] seven thousand chariots, and
forty thousand footmen, and killed Shophach the captain of the army.

<span id="an_19:19">19:19</span> When the servants of Hadadezer saw that
they were defeated by Israel, they made peace with David, and served
him: neither would the Syrians help the children of Ammon any more.

<span id="an_20:1">20:1</span> It happened, at the time of the return of
the year, at the time when kings go out \[to battle\], that Joab led
forth the army, and wasted the country of the children of Ammon, and
came and besieged Rabbah. But David stayed at Jerusalem. Joab struck
Rabbah, and overthrew it.

<span id="an_20:2">20:2</span> David took the crown of their king from
off his head, and found it to weigh a talent of gold, and there were
precious stones in it; and it was set on David's head: and he brought
forth the spoil of the city, exceeding much.

<span id="an_20:3">20:3</span> He brought forth the people who were
therein, and cut \[them\] with saws, and with iron picks, and with axes.
David did so to all the cities of the children of Ammon. David and all
the people returned to Jerusalem.

<span id="an_20:4">20:4</span> It happened after this, that there arose
war at Gezer with the Philistines: then Sibbecai the Hushathite killed
Sippai, of the sons of the giant; and they were subdued.

<span id="an_20:5">20:5</span> There was again war with the Philistines;
and Elhanan the son of Jair killed Lahmi the brother of Goliath the
Gittite, the staff of whose spear was like a weaver's beam.

<span id="an_20:6">20:6</span> There was again war at Gath, where there
was a man of great stature, whose fingers and toes were twenty-four, six
\[on each hand\], and six \[on each foot\]; and he also was born to the
giant.

<span id="an_20:7">20:7</span> When he defied Israel, Jonathan the son
of Shimea David's brother killed him.

<span id="an_20:8">20:8</span> These were born to the giant in Gath; and
they fell by the hand of David, and by the hand of his servants.

<span id="an_21:1">21:1</span> Satan stood up against Israel, and moved
David to number Israel.

<span id="an_21:2">21:2</span> David said to Joab and to the princes of
the people, "Go, number Israel from Beersheba even to Dan; and bring me
word, that I may know the sum of them."

<span id="an_21:3">21:3</span> Joab said, "May Yahweh make his people a
hundred times as many as they are. But, my lord the king, aren't they
all my lord's servants? Why does my lord require this thing? Why will he
be a cause of guilt to Israel?"

<span id="an_21:4">21:4</span> Nevertheless the king's word prevailed
against Joab. Therefore Joab departed, and went throughout all Israel,
and came to Jerusalem.

<span id="an_21:5">21:5</span> Joab gave up the sum of the numbering of
the people to David. All those of Israel were one million one hundred
thousand men who drew sword: and in Judah were four hundred seventy
thousand men who drew sword.

<span id="an_21:6">21:6</span> But he didn't count Levi and Benjamin
among them; for the king's word was abominable to Joab.

<span id="an_21:7">21:7</span> God was displeased with this thing;
therefore he struck Israel.

<span id="an_21:8">21:8</span> David said to God, "I have sinned
greatly, in that I have done this thing. But now, put away, I beg you,
the iniquity of your servant; for I have done very foolishly."

<span id="an_21:9">21:9</span> Yahweh spoke to Gad, David's seer,
saying,

<span id="an_21:10">21:10</span> "Go and speak to David, saying, 'Thus
says Yahweh, "I offer you three things. Choose one of them, that I may
do it to you."'"

<span id="an_21:11">21:11</span> So Gad came to David, and said to him,
"Thus says Yahweh, 'Take your choice:

<span id="an_21:12">21:12</span> either three years of famine; or three
months to be consumed before your foes, while the sword of your enemies
overtakes you; or else three days the sword of Yahweh, even pestilence
in the land, and the angel of Yahweh destroying throughout all the
borders of Israel. Now therefore consider what answer I shall return to
him who sent me.'"

<span id="an_21:13">21:13</span> David said to Gad, "I am in distress.
Let me fall, I pray, into the hand of Yahweh; for his mercies are very
great. Let me not fall into the hand of man."

<span id="an_21:14">21:14</span> So Yahweh sent a pestilence on Israel;
and seventy thousand men of Israel fell.

<span id="an_21:15">21:15</span> God sent an angel to Jerusalem to
destroy it. As he was about to destroy, Yahweh saw, and he relented of
the disaster, and said to the destroying angel, "It is enough; now stay
your hand." The angel of Yahweh was standing by the threshing floor of
Ornan the Jebusite.

<span id="an_21:16">21:16</span> David lifted up his eyes, and saw the
angel of Yahweh standing between earth and the sky, having a drawn sword
in his hand stretched out over Jerusalem. Then David and the elders,
clothed in sackcloth, fell on their faces.

<span id="an_21:17">21:17</span> David said to God, "Isn't it I who
commanded the people to be numbered? It is even I who have sinned and
done very wickedly; but these sheep, what have they done? Please let
your hand, O Yahweh my God, be against me, and against my father's
house; but not against your people, that they should be plagued."

<span id="an_21:18">21:18</span> Then the angel of Yahweh commanded Gad
to tell David that David should go up, and raise an altar to Yahweh in
the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.

<span id="an_21:19">21:19</span> David went up at the saying of Gad,
which he spoke in the name of Yahweh.

<span id="an_21:20">21:20</span> Ornan turned back, and saw the angel;
and his four sons who were with him hid themselves. Now Ornan was
threshing wheat.

<span id="an_21:21">21:21</span> As David came to Ornan, Ornan looked
and saw David, and went out of the threshing floor, and bowed himself to
David with his face to the ground.

<span id="an_21:22">21:22</span> Then David said to Ornan, "Give me the
place of this threshing floor, that I may build thereon an altar to
Yahweh. You shall sell it to me for the full price, that the plague may
be stopped from afflicting the people."

<span id="an_21:23">21:23</span> Ornan said to David, "Take it for
yourself, and let my lord the king do that which is good in his eyes.
Behold, I give the oxen for burnt offerings, and the threshing
instruments for wood, and the wheat for the meal offering. I give it
all."

<span id="an_21:24">21:24</span> King David said to Ornan, "No; but I
will most certainly buy it for the full price. For I will not take that
which is yours for Yahweh, nor offer a burnt offering without cost."

<span id="an_21:25">21:25</span> So David gave to Ornan six hundred
shekels of gold by weight for the place.

<span id="an_21:26">21:26</span> David built an altar to Yahweh there,
and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings, and called on Yahweh;
and he answered him from the sky by fire on the altar of burnt offering.

<span id="an_21:27">21:27</span> Yahweh commanded the angel; and he put
up his sword again into its sheath.

<span id="an_21:28">21:28</span> At that time, when David saw that
Yahweh had answered him in the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite,
then he sacrificed there.

<span id="an_21:29">21:29</span> For the tabernacle of Yahweh, which
Moses made in the wilderness, and the altar of burnt offering, were at
that time in the high place at Gibeon.

<span id="an_21:30">21:30</span> But David couldn't go before it to
inquire of God; for he was afraid because of the sword of the angel of
Yahweh.

<span id="an_22:1">22:1</span> Then David said, "This is the house of
Yahweh God, and this is the altar of burnt offering for Israel."

<span id="an_22:2">22:2</span> David gave orders to gather together the
foreigners who were in the land of Israel; and he set masons to cut
worked stones to build the house of God.

<span id="an_22:3">22:3</span> David prepared iron in abundance for the
nails for the doors of the gates, and for the couplings; and brass in
abundance without weight;

<span id="an_22:4">22:4</span> and cedar trees without number: for the
Sidonians and they of Tyre brought cedar trees in abundance to David.

<span id="an_22:5">22:5</span> David said, "Solomon my son is young and
tender, and the house that is to be built for Yahweh must be exceedingly
magnificent, of fame and of glory throughout all countries. I will
therefore make preparation for it." So David prepared abundantly before
his death.

<span id="an_22:6">22:6</span> Then he called for Solomon his son, and
commanded him to build a house for Yahweh, the God of Israel.

<span id="an_22:7">22:7</span> David said to Solomon his son, "As for
me, it was in my heart to build a house to the name of Yahweh my God.

<span id="an_22:8">22:8</span> But the word of Yahweh came to me,
saying, 'You have shed blood abundantly, and have made great wars. You
shall not build a house to my name, because you have shed much blood on
the earth in my sight.

<span id="an_22:9">22:9</span> Behold, a son shall be born to you, who
shall be a man of rest. I will give him rest from all his enemies all
around; for his name shall be Solomon, and I will give peace and
quietness to Israel in his days.

<span id="an_22:10">22:10</span> He shall build a house for my name; and
he shall be my son, and I will be his father; and I will establish the
throne of his kingdom over Israel for ever.'

<span id="an_22:11">22:11</span> Now, my son, may Yahweh be with you and
prosper you, and build the house of Yahweh your God, as he has spoken
concerning you.

<span id="an_22:12">22:12</span> May Yahweh give you discretion and
understanding, and put you in charge of Israel; that so you may keep the
law of Yahweh your God.

<span id="an_22:13">22:13</span> Then you will prosper, if you observe
to do the statutes and the ordinances which Yahweh gave Moses concerning
Israel. Be strong, and courageous. Don't be afraid, neither be dismayed.

<span id="an_22:14">22:14</span> Now, behold, in my affliction I have
prepared for the house of Yahweh one hundred thousand talents of gold,
one million talents of silver, and brass and iron without weight; for it
is in abundance. I have also prepared timber and stone; and you may add
to them.

<span id="an_22:15">22:15</span> There are also workmen with you in
abundance, cutters and workers of stone and timber, and all kinds of men
who are skillful in every kind of work:

<span id="an_22:16">22:16</span> of the gold, the silver, and the brass,
and the iron, there is no number. Arise and be doing, and may Yahweh be
with you."

<span id="an_22:17">22:17</span> David also commanded all the princes of
Israel to help Solomon his son, saying,

<span id="an_22:18">22:18</span> "Isn't Yahweh your God with you? Hasn't
he given you rest on every side? For he has delivered the inhabitants of
the land into my hand; and the land is subdued before Yahweh, and before
his people.

<span id="an_22:19">22:19</span> Now set your heart and your soul to
seek after Yahweh your God. Arise therefore, and build the sanctuary of
Yahweh God, to bring the ark of the covenant of Yahweh, and the holy
vessels of God, into the house that is to be built to the name of
Yahweh."

<span id="an_23:1">23:1</span> Now David was old and full of days; and
he made Solomon his son king over Israel.

<span id="an_23:2">23:2</span> He gathered together all the princes of
Israel, with the priests and the Levites.

<span id="an_23:3">23:3</span> The Levites were numbered from thirty
years old and upward: and their number by their polls, man by man, was
thirty-eight thousand.

<span id="an_23:4">23:4</span> David said, "Of these, twenty-four
thousand were to oversee the work of the house of Yahweh; six thousand
were officers and judges;

<span id="an_23:5">23:5</span> four thousand were doorkeepers; and four
thousand praised Yahweh with the instruments which I made, for giving
praise."

<span id="an_23:6">23:6</span> David divided them into divisions
according to the sons of Levi: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.

<span id="an_23:7">23:7</span> Of the Gershonites: Ladan and Shimei.

<span id="an_23:8">23:8</span> The sons of Ladan: Jehiel the chief, and
Zetham, and Joel, three.

<span id="an_23:9">23:9</span> The sons of Shimei: Shelomoth, and
Haziel, and Haran, three. These were the heads of the fathers'
\[houses\] of Ladan.

<span id="an_23:10">23:10</span> The sons of Shimei: Jahath, Zina, and
Jeush, and Beriah. These four were the sons of Shimei.

<span id="an_23:11">23:11</span> Jahath was the chief, and Zizah the
second: but Jeush and Beriah didn't have many sons; therefore they
became a fathers' house in one reckoning.

<span id="an_23:12">23:12</span> The sons of Kohath: Amram, Izhar,
Hebron, and Uzziel, four.

<span id="an_23:13">23:13</span> The sons of Amram: Aaron and Moses; and
Aaron was separated, that he should sanctify the most holy things, he
and his sons, forever, to burn incense before Yahweh, to minister to
him, and to bless in his name, forever.

<span id="an_23:14">23:14</span> But as for Moses the man of God, his
sons were named among the tribe of Levi.

<span id="an_23:15">23:15</span> The sons of Moses: Gershom and Eliezer.

<span id="an_23:16">23:16</span> The sons of Gershom: Shebuel the chief.

<span id="an_23:17">23:17</span> The sons of Eliezer were: Rehabiah the
chief; and Eliezer had no other sons; but the sons of Rehabiah were very
many.

<span id="an_23:18">23:18</span> The sons of Izhar: Shelomith the chief.

<span id="an_23:19">23:19</span> The sons of Hebron: Jeriah the chief,
Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third, and Jekameam the fourth.

<span id="an_23:20">23:20</span> The sons of Uzziel: Micah the chief,
and Isshiah the second.

<span id="an_23:21">23:21</span> The sons of Merari: Mahli and Mushi.
The sons of Mahli: Eleazar and Kish.

<span id="an_23:22">23:22</span> Eleazar died, and had no sons, but
daughters only: and their brothers the sons of Kish took them \[to
wife\].

<span id="an_23:23">23:23</span> The sons of Mushi: Mahli, and Eder, and
Jeremoth, three.

<span id="an_23:24">23:24</span> These were the sons of Levi after their
fathers' houses, even the heads of the fathers' houses of those who were
counted individually, in the number of names by their polls, who did the
work for the service of the house of Yahweh, from twenty years old and
upward.

<span id="an_23:25">23:25</span> For David said, "Yahweh, the God of
Israel, has given rest to his people; and he dwells in Jerusalem
forever.

<span id="an_23:26">23:26</span> Also the Levites will no longer need to
carry the tabernacle and all its vessels for its service."

<span id="an_23:27">23:27</span> For by the last words of David the sons
of Levi were numbered, from twenty years old and upward.

<span id="an_23:28">23:28</span> For their office was to wait on the
sons of Aaron for the service of the house of Yahweh, in the courts, and
in the rooms, and in the purifying of all holy things, even the work of
the service of the house of God;

<span id="an_23:29">23:29</span> for the show bread also, and for the
fine flour for a meal offering, whether of unleavened wafers, or of that
which is baked in the pan, or of that which is soaked, and for all kinds
of measure and size;

<span id="an_23:30">23:30</span> and to stand every morning to thank and
praise Yahweh, and likewise in the evening;

<span id="an_23:31">23:31</span> and to offer all burnt offerings to
Yahweh, on the Sabbaths, on the new moons, and on the set feasts, in
number according to the ordinance concerning them, continually before
Yahweh;

<span id="an_23:32">23:32</span> and that they should keep the duty of
the Tent of Meeting, and the duty of the holy place, and the duty of the
sons of Aaron their brothers, for the service of the house of Yahweh.

<span id="an_24:1">24:1</span> These were the divisions of the sons of
Aaron. The sons of Aaron: Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar.

<span id="an_24:2">24:2</span> But Nadab and Abihu died before their
father, and had no children: therefore Eleazar and Ithamar executed the
priest's office.

<span id="an_24:3">24:3</span> David with Zadok of the sons of Eleazar,
and Ahimelech of the sons of Ithamar, divided them according to their
ordering in their service.

<span id="an_24:4">24:4</span> There were more chief men found of the
sons of Eleazar than of the sons of Ithamar; and \[thus\] were they
divided: of the sons of Eleazar there were sixteen, heads of fathers'
houses; and of the sons of Ithamar, according to their fathers' houses,
eight.

<span id="an_24:5">24:5</span> Thus were they divided impartially by
drawing lots; for there were princes of the sanctuary, and princes of
God, both of the sons of Eleazar, and of the sons of Ithamar.

<span id="an_24:6">24:6</span> Shemaiah the son of Nethanel the scribe,
who was of the Levites, wrote them in the presence of the king, and the
princes, and Zadok the priest, and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, and
the heads of the fathers' \[houses\] of the priests and of the Levites;
one fathers' house being taken for Eleazar, and one taken for Ithamar.

<span id="an_24:7">24:7</span> Now the first lot came forth to
Jehoiarib, the second to Jedaiah,

<span id="an_24:8">24:8</span> the third to Harim, the fourth to Seorim,

<span id="an_24:9">24:9</span> the fifth to Malchijah, the sixth to
Mijamin,

<span id="an_24:10">24:10</span> the seventh to Hakkoz, the eighth to
Abijah,

<span id="an_24:11">24:11</span> the ninth to Jeshua, the tenth to
Shecaniah,

<span id="an_24:12">24:12</span> the eleventh to Eliashib, the twelfth
to Jakim,

<span id="an_24:13">24:13</span> the thirteenth to Huppah, the
fourteenth to Jeshebeab,

<span id="an_24:14">24:14</span> the fifteenth to Bilgah, the sixteenth
to Immer,

<span id="an_24:15">24:15</span> the seventeenth to Hezir, the
eighteenth to Happizzez,

<span id="an_24:16">24:16</span> the nineteenth to Pethahiah, the
twentieth to Jehezkel,

<span id="an_24:17">24:17</span> the twenty-first to Jachin, the
twenty-second to Gamul,

<span id="an_24:18">24:18</span> the twenty-third to Delaiah, the
twenty-fourth to Maaziah.

<span id="an_24:19">24:19</span> This was the ordering of them in their
service, to come into the house of Yahweh according to the ordinance
\[given\] to them by Aaron their father, as Yahweh, the God of Israel,
had commanded him.

<span id="an_24:20">24:20</span> Of the rest of the sons of Levi: of the
sons of Amram, Shubael; of the sons of Shubael, Jehdeiah.

<span id="an_24:21">24:21</span> Of Rehabiah: of the sons of Rehabiah,
Isshiah the chief.

<span id="an_24:22">24:22</span> Of the Izharites, Shelomoth; of the
sons of Shelomoth, Jahath.

<span id="an_24:23">24:23</span> The sons \[of Hebron\]: Jeriah \[the
chief\], Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third, Jekameam the fourth.

<span id="an_24:24">24:24</span> The sons of Uzziel, Micah; of the sons
of Micah, Shamir.

<span id="an_24:25">24:25</span> The brother of Micah, Isshiah; of the
sons of Isshiah, Zechariah.

<span id="an_24:26">24:26</span> The sons of Merari: Mahli and Mushi;
the sons of Jaaziah: Beno.

<span id="an_24:27">24:27</span> The sons of Merari: of Jaaziah, Beno,
and Shoham, and Zaccur, and Ibri.

<span id="an_24:28">24:28</span> Of Mahli: Eleazar, who had no sons.

<span id="an_24:29">24:29</span> Of Kish; the sons of Kish: Jerahmeel.

<span id="an_24:30">24:30</span> The sons of Mushi: Mahli, and Eder, and
Jerimoth. These were the sons of the Levites after their fathers'
houses.

<span id="an_24:31">24:31</span> These likewise cast lots even as their
brothers the sons of Aaron in the presence of David the king, and Zadok,
and Ahimelech, and the heads of the fathers' \[houses\] of the priests
and of the Levites; the fathers' \[houses\] of the chief even as those
of his younger brother.

<span id="an_25:1">25:1</span> Moreover, David and the captains of the
army set apart for the service certain of the sons of Asaph, and of
Heman, and of Jeduthun, who should prophesy with harps, with stringed
instruments, and with cymbals: and the number of those who did the work
according to their service was:

<span id="an_25:2">25:2</span> of the sons of Asaph: Zaccur, and Joseph,
and Nethaniah, and Asharelah, the sons of Asaph, under the hand of
Asaph, who prophesied after the order of the king.

<span id="an_25:3">25:3</span> Of Jeduthun; the sons of Jeduthun:
Gedaliah, and Zeri, and Jeshaiah, Hashabiah, and Mattithiah, six, under
the hands of their father Jeduthun with the harp, who prophesied in
giving thanks and praising Yahweh.

<span id="an_25:4">25:4</span> Of Heman; the sons of Heman: Bukkiah,
Mattaniah, Uzziel, Shebuel, and Jerimoth, Hananiah, Hanani, Eliathah,
Giddalti, and Romamti-Ezer, Joshbekashah, Mallothi, Hothir, Mahazioth.

<span id="an_25:5">25:5</span> All these were the sons of Heman the
king's seer in the words of God, to lift up the horn. God gave to Heman
fourteen sons and three daughters.

<span id="an_25:6">25:6</span> All these were under the hands of their
father for song in the house of Yahweh, with cymbals, stringed
instruments, and harps, for the service of the house of God; Asaph,
Jeduthun, and Heman being under the order of the king.

<span id="an_25:7">25:7</span> The number of them, with their brothers
who were instructed in singing to Yahweh, even all who were skillful,
was two hundred eighty-eight.

<span id="an_25:8">25:8</span> They cast lots for their offices, all
alike, as well the small as the great, the teacher as the scholar.

<span id="an_25:9">25:9</span> Now the first lot came forth for Asaph to
Joseph: the second to Gedaliah; he and his brothers and sons were
twelve:

<span id="an_25:10">25:10</span> the third to Zaccur, his sons and his
brothers, twelve:

<span id="an_25:11">25:11</span> the fourth to Izri, his sons and his

brothers, twelve:

<span id="an_25:18">25:18</span> the eleventh to Azarel, his sons and
his brothers, twelve:

<span id="an_25:19">25:19</span> the twelfth to Hashabiah, his sons and
his brothers, twelve:

<span id="an_25:20">25:20</span> for the thirteenth, Shubael, his sons
and his brothers, twelve:

and his brothers, twelve:

<span id="an_25:24">25:24</span> for the seventeenth to Joshbekashah,
his sons and his brothers, twelve:

<span id="an_25:25">25:25</span> for the eighteenth to Hanani, his sons
and his brothers, twelve:

<span id="an_25:26">25:26</span> for the nineteenth to Mallothi, his
sons and his brothers, twelve:

<span id="an_25:27">25:27</span> for the twentieth to Eliathah, his sons
and his brothers, twelve:

<span id="an_25:28">25:28</span> for the one and twentieth to Hothir,

Mahazioth, his sons and his brothers, twelve:

<span id="an_25:31">25:31</span> for the four and twentieth to
Romamti-Ezer, his sons and his brothers, twelve.

<span id="an_26:1">26:1</span> For the divisions of the doorkeepers: of
the Korahites, Meshelemiah the son of Kore, of the sons of Asaph.

<span id="an_26:2">26:2</span> Meshelemiah had sons: Zechariah the
firstborn, Jediael the second, Zebadiah the third, Jathniel the fourth,

<span id="an_26:3">26:3</span> Elam the fifth, Jehohanan the sixth,
Eliehoenai the seventh.

<span id="an_26:4">26:4</span> Obed-Edom had sons: Shemaiah the
firstborn, Jehozabad the second, Joah the third, and Sacar the fourth,
and Nethanel the fifth,

<span id="an_26:5">26:5</span> Ammiel the sixth, Issachar the seventh,
Peullethai the eighth; for God blessed him.

<span id="an_26:6">26:6</span> Also to Shemaiah his son were sons born,
who ruled over the house of their father; for they were mighty men of
valor.

<span id="an_26:7">26:7</span> The sons of Shemaiah: Othni, and Rephael,
and Obed, Elzabad, whose brothers were valiant men, Elihu, and
Semachiah.

<span id="an_26:8">26:8</span> All these were of the sons of Obed-Edom:
they and their sons and their brothers, able men in strength for the
service; sixty-two of Obed-Edom.

<span id="an_26:9">26:9</span> Meshelemiah had sons and brothers,
valiant men, eighteen.

<span id="an_26:10">26:10</span> Also Hosah, of the children of Merari,
had sons: Shimri the chief, (for though he was not the firstborn, yet
his father made him chief),

<span id="an_26:11">26:11</span> Hilkiah the second, Tebaliah the third,
Zechariah the fourth: all the sons and brothers of Hosah were thirteen.

<span id="an_26:12">26:12</span> Of these were the divisions of the
doorkeepers, even of the chief men, having offices like their brothers,
to minister in the house of Yahweh.

<span id="an_26:13">26:13</span> They cast lots, the small as well as
the great, according to their fathers' houses, for every gate.

<span id="an_26:14">26:14</span> The lot eastward fell to Shelemiah.
Then for Zechariah his son, a wise counselor, they cast lots; and his
lot came out northward.

<span id="an_26:15">26:15</span> To Obed-Edom southward; and to his sons
the storehouse.

<span id="an_26:16">26:16</span> To Shuppim and Hosah westward, by the
gate of Shallecheth, at the causeway that goes up, watch against watch.

<span id="an_26:17">26:17</span> Eastward were six Levites, northward
four a day, southward four a day, and for the storehouse two and two.

<span id="an_26:18">26:18</span> For Parbar westward, four at the
causeway, and two at Parbar.

<span id="an_26:19">26:19</span> These were the divisions of the
doorkeepers; of the sons of the Korahites, and of the sons of Merari.

<span id="an_26:20">26:20</span> Of the Levites, Ahijah was over the
treasures of the house of God, and over the treasures of the dedicated
things.

<span id="an_26:21">26:21</span> The sons of Ladan, the sons of the
Gershonites belonging to Ladan, the heads of the fathers' \[houses\]
belonging to Ladan the Gershonite: Jehieli.

<span id="an_26:22">26:22</span> The sons of Jehieli: Zetham, and Joel
his brother, over the treasures of the house of Yahweh.

<span id="an_26:23">26:23</span> Of the Amramites, of the Izharites, of
the Hebronites, of the Uzzielites:

<span id="an_26:24">26:24</span> and Shebuel the son of Gershom, the son
of Moses, was ruler over the treasures.

<span id="an_26:25">26:25</span> His brothers: of Eliezer \[came\]
Rehabiah his son, and Jeshaiah his son, and Joram his son, and Zichri
his son, and Shelomoth his son.

<span id="an_26:26">26:26</span> This Shelomoth and his brothers were
over all the treasures of the dedicated things, which David the king,
and the heads of the fathers' \[houses\], the captains over thousands
and hundreds, and the captains of the army, had dedicated.

<span id="an_26:27">26:27</span> Out of the spoil won in battles did
they dedicate to repair the house of Yahweh.

<span id="an_26:28">26:28</span> All that Samuel the seer, and Saul the
son of Kish, and Abner the son of Ner, and Joab the son of Zeruiah, had
dedicated, whoever had dedicated anything, it was under the hand of
Shelomoth, and of his brothers.

<span id="an_26:29">26:29</span> Of the Izharites, Chenaniah and his
sons were for the outward business over Israel, for officers and judges.

<span id="an_26:30">26:30</span> Of the Hebronites, Hashabiah and his
brothers, men of valor, one thousand seven hundred, had the oversight of
Israel beyond the Jordan westward, for all the business of Yahweh, and
for the service of the king.

<span id="an_26:31">26:31</span> Of the Hebronites was Jerijah the
chief, even of the Hebronites, according to their generations by
fathers' \[houses\]. In the fortieth year of the reign of David they
were sought for, and there were found among them mighty men of valor at
Jazer of Gilead.

<span id="an_26:32">26:32</span> His brothers, men of valor, were two
thousand seven hundred, heads of fathers' \[houses\], whom king David
made overseers over the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half-tribe
of the Manassites, for every matter pertaining to God, and for the
affairs of the king.

<span id="an_27:1">27:1</span> Now the children of Israel after their
number, the heads of fathers' \[houses\] and the captains of thousands
and of hundreds, and their officers who served the king, in any matter
of the divisions which came in and went out month by month throughout
all the months of the year--of every division were twenty-four thousand.

<span id="an_27:2">27:2</span> Over the first division for the first
month was Jashobeam the son of Zabdiel: and in his division were
twenty-four thousand.

<span id="an_27:3">27:3</span> \[He was\] of the children of Perez, the
chief of all the captains of the army for the first month.

<span id="an_27:4">27:4</span> Over the division of the second month was
Dodai the Ahohite, and his division; and Mikloth the ruler: and in his
division were twenty-four thousand.

<span id="an_27:5">27:5</span> The third captain of the army for the
third month was Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada the priest, chief: and in
his division were twenty-four thousand.

<span id="an_27:6">27:6</span> This is that Benaiah, who was the mighty
man of the thirty, and over the thirty: and \[of\] his division was
Ammizabad his son.

<span id="an_27:7">27:7</span> The fourth \[captain\] for the fourth
month was Asahel the brother of Joab, and Zebadiah his son after him:
and in his division were twenty-four thousand.

<span id="an_27:8">27:8</span> The fifth captain for this fifth month
was Shamhuth the Izrahite: and in his division were twenty-four
thousand.

<span id="an_27:9">27:9</span> The sixth \[captain\] for the sixth month
was Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite: and in his division were
twenty-four thousand.

<span id="an_27:10">27:10</span> The seventh \[captain\] for the seventh
month was Helez the Pelonite, of the children of Ephraim: and in his
division were twenty-four thousand.

<span id="an_27:11">27:11</span> The eighth \[captain\] for the eighth
month was Sibbecai the Hushathite, of the Zerahites: and in his division
were twenty-four thousand.

<span id="an_27:12">27:12</span> The ninth \[captain\] for the ninth
month was Abiezer the Anathothite, of the Benjamites: and in his
division were twenty-four thousand.

<span id="an_27:13">27:13</span> The tenth \[captain\] for the tenth
month was Maharai the Netophathite, of the Zerahites: and in his
division were Twenty-four thousand.

<span id="an_27:14">27:14</span> The eleventh \[captain\] for the
eleventh month was Benaiah the Pirathonite, of the children of Ephraim:
and in his division were twenty-four thousand.

<span id="an_27:15">27:15</span> The twelfth \[captain\] for the twelfth
month was Heldai the Netophathite, of Othniel: and in his division were
twenty-four thousand.

<span id="an_27:16">27:16</span> Furthermore over the tribes of Israel:
of the Reubenites was Eliezer the son of Zichri the ruler: of the
Simeonites, Shephatiah the son of Maacah:

<span id="an_27:17">27:17</span> of Levi, Hashabiah the son of Kemuel:
of Aaron, Zadok:

<span id="an_27:18">27:18</span> of Judah, Elihu, one of the brothers of
David: of Issachar, Omri the son of Michael:

<span id="an_27:19">27:19</span> of Zebulun, Ishmaiah the son of
Obadiah: of Naphtali, Jeremoth the son of Azriel:

<span id="an_27:20">27:20</span> of the children of Ephraim, Hoshea the
son of Azaziah: of the half-tribe of Manasseh, Joel the son of Pedaiah:

<span id="an_27:21">27:21</span> of the half-tribe of Manasseh in
Gilead, Iddo the son of Zechariah: of Benjamin, Jaasiel the son of
Abner:

<span id="an_27:22">27:22</span> of Dan, Azarel the son of Jeroham.
These were the captains of the tribes of Israel.

<span id="an_27:23">27:23</span> But David didn't take the number of
them from twenty years old and under, because Yahweh had said he would
increase Israel like the stars of the sky.

<span id="an_27:24">27:24</span> Joab the son of Zeruiah began to
number, but didn't finish; and there came wrath for this on Israel;
neither was the number put into the account in the chronicles of king
David.

<span id="an_27:25">27:25</span> Over the king's treasures was Azmaveth
the son of Adiel: and over the treasures in the fields, in the cities,
and in the villages, and in the towers, was Jonathan the son of Uzziah:

<span id="an_27:26">27:26</span> Over those who did the work of the
field for tillage of the ground was Ezri the son of Chelub:

<span id="an_27:27">27:27</span> and over the vineyards was Shimei the
Ramathite: and over the increase of the vineyards for the winecellars
was Zabdi the Shiphmite:

<span id="an_27:28">27:28</span> and over the olive trees and the
sycamore trees that were in the lowland was Baal Hanan the Gederite: and
over the cellars of oil was Joash:

<span id="an_27:29">27:29</span> and over the herds that fed in Sharon
was Shitrai the Sharonite: and over the herds that were in the valleys
was Shaphat the son of Adlai:

<span id="an_27:30">27:30</span> and over the camels was Obil the
Ishmaelite: and over the donkeys was Jehdeiah the Meronothite: and over
the flocks was Jaziz the Hagrite.

<span id="an_27:31">27:31</span> All these were the rulers of the
substance which was king David's.

<span id="an_27:32">27:32</span> Also Jonathan, David's uncle, was a
counselor, a man of understanding, and a scribe: and Jehiel the son of
Hachmoni was with the king's sons:

<span id="an_27:33">27:33</span> Ahithophel was the king's counselor:
and Hushai the Archite was the king's friend:

<span id="an_27:34">27:34</span> and after Ahithophel was Jehoiada the
son of Benaiah, and Abiathar: and the captain of the king's army was
Joab.

<span id="an_28:1">28:1</span> David assembled all the princes of
Israel, the princes of the tribes, and the captains of the companies who
served the king by division, and the captains of thousands, and the
captains of hundreds, and the rulers over all the substance and
possessions of the king and of his sons, with the officers, and the
mighty men, even all the mighty men of valor, to Jerusalem.

<span id="an_28:2">28:2</span> Then David the king stood up on his feet,
and said, "Hear me, my brothers, and my people! As for me, it was in my
heart to build a house of rest for the ark of the covenant of Yahweh,
and for the footstool of our God; and I had prepared for the building.

<span id="an_28:3">28:3</span> But God said to me, 'You shall not build
a house for my name, because you are a man of war, and have shed blood.'

<span id="an_28:4">28:4</span> However Yahweh, the God of Israel, chose
me out of all the house of my father to be king over Israel forever. For
he has chosen Judah to be prince; and in the house of Judah, the house
of my father; and among the sons of my father he took pleasure in me to
make me king over all Israel.

<span id="an_28:5">28:5</span> Of all my sons (for Yahweh has given me
many sons), he has chosen Solomon my son to sit on the throne of
Yahweh's kingdom over Israel.

<span id="an_28:6">28:6</span> He said to me, 'Solomon, your son, shall
build my house and my courts; for I have chosen him to be my son, and I
will be his father.

<span id="an_28:7">28:7</span> I will establish his kingdom forever, if
he continues to do my commandments and my ordinances, as at this day.'

<span id="an_28:8">28:8</span> Now therefore, in the sight of all
Israel, the assembly of Yahweh, and in the audience of our God, observe
and seek out all the commandments of Yahweh your God; that you may
possess this good land, and leave it for an inheritance to your children
after you forever.

<span id="an_28:9">28:9</span> You, Solomon my son, know the God of your
father, and serve him with a perfect heart and with a willing mind; for
Yahweh searches all hearts, and understands all the imaginations of the
thoughts. If you seek him, he will be found by you; but if you forsake
him, he will cast you off forever.

<span id="an_28:10">28:10</span> Take heed now; for Yahweh has chosen
you to build a house for the sanctuary. Be strong, and do it."

<span id="an_28:11">28:11</span> Then David gave to Solomon his son the
pattern of the porch \[of the temple\], and of its houses, and of its
treasuries, and of the upper rooms of it, and of the inner rooms of it,
and of the place of the mercy seat;

<span id="an_28:12">28:12</span> and the pattern of all that he had by
the Spirit, for the courts of the house of Yahweh, and for all the
surrounding rooms, for the treasuries of the house of God, and for the
treasuries of the dedicated things;

<span id="an_28:13">28:13</span> also for the divisions of the priests
and the Levites, and for all the work of the service of the house of
Yahweh, and for all the vessels of service in the house of Yahweh;

<span id="an_28:14">28:14</span> of gold by weight for the \[vessels
of\] gold, for all vessels of every kind of service; \[of silver\] for
all the vessels of silver by weight, for all vessels of every kind of
service;

<span id="an_28:15">28:15</span> by weight also for the lampstands of
gold, and for its lamps, of gold, by weight for every lampstand and for
its lamps; and for the lampstands of silver, \[silver\] by weight for
\[every\] lampstand and for its lamps, according to the use of every
lampstand;

<span id="an_28:16">28:16</span> and the gold by weight for the tables
of show bread, for every table; and silver for the tables of silver;

<span id="an_28:17">28:17</span> and the forks, and the basins, and the
cups, of pure gold; and for the golden bowls by weight for every bowl;
and for the silver bowls by weight for every bowl;

<span id="an_28:18">28:18</span> and for the altar of incense refined
gold by weight; and gold for the pattern of the chariot, \[even\] the
cherubim, that spread out \[their wings\], and covered the ark of the
covenant of Yahweh.

<span id="an_28:19">28:19</span> "All this," said David, "I have been
made to understand in writing from the hand of Yahweh, even all the
works of this pattern."

<span id="an_28:20">28:20</span> David said to Solomon his son, "Be
strong and courageous, and do it. Don't be afraid, nor be dismayed; for
Yahweh God, even my God, is with you. He will not fail you, nor forsake
you, until all the work for the service of the house of Yahweh is
finished.

<span id="an_28:21">28:21</span> Behold, there are the divisions of the
priests and the Levites, for all the service of the house of God. There
shall be with you in all kinds of work every willing man who has skill,
for any kind of service. Also the captains and all the people will be
entirely at your command."

<span id="an_29:1">29:1</span> David the king said to all the assembly,
"Solomon my son, whom alone God has chosen, is yet young and tender, and
the work is great; for the palace is not for man, but for Yahweh God.

<span id="an_29:2">29:2</span> Now I have prepared with all my might for
the house of my God the gold for the \[things of\] gold, and the silver
for the \[things of\] silver, and the brass for the \[things of\] brass,
the iron for the \[things of\] iron, and wood for the \[things of\]
wood; onyx stones, and \[stones\] to be set, stones for inlaid work, and
of various colors, and all kinds of precious stones, and marble stones
in abundance.

<span id="an_29:3">29:3</span> In addition, because I have set my
affection on the house of my God, since I have a treasure of my own of
gold and silver, I give it to the house of my God, over and above all
that I have prepared for the holy house,

<span id="an_29:4">29:4</span> even three thousand talents of gold, of
the gold of Ophir, and seven thousand talents of refined silver, with
which to overlay the walls of the houses;

<span id="an_29:5">29:5</span> of gold for the \[things of\] gold, and
of silver for the \[things of\] silver, and for all kinds of work \[to
be made\] by the hands of artificers. Who then offers willingly to
consecrate himself this day to Yahweh?"

<span id="an_29:6">29:6</span> Then the princes of the fathers'
\[houses\], and the princes of the tribes of Israel, and the captains of
thousands and of hundreds, with the rulers over the king's work, offered
willingly;

<span id="an_29:7">29:7</span> and they gave for the service of the
house of God of gold five thousand talents and ten thousand darics, and
of silver ten thousand talents, and of brass eighteen thousand talents,
and of iron a hundred thousand talents.

<span id="an_29:8">29:8</span> They with whom \[precious\] stones were
found gave them to the treasure of the house of Yahweh, under the hand
of Jehiel the Gershonite.

<span id="an_29:9">29:9</span> Then the people rejoiced, because they
offered willingly, because with a perfect heart they offered willingly
to Yahweh: and David the king also rejoiced with great joy.

<span id="an_29:10">29:10</span> Therefore David blessed Yahweh before
all the assembly; and David said, "You are blessed, Yahweh, the God of
Israel our father, forever and ever.

<span id="an_29:11">29:11</span> Yours, Yahweh, is the greatness, the
power, the glory, the victory, and the majesty! For all that is in the
heavens and in the earth is yours. Yours is the kingdom, Yahweh, and you
are exalted as head above all.

<span id="an_29:12">29:12</span> Both riches and honor come from you,
and you rule over all; and in your hand is power and might; and it is in
your hand to make great, and to give strength to all.

<span id="an_29:13">29:13</span> Now therefore, our God, we thank you,
and praise your glorious name.

<span id="an_29:14">29:14</span> But who am I, and what is my people,
that we should be able to offer so willingly as this? For all things
come from you, and of your own have we given you.

<span id="an_29:15">29:15</span> For we are strangers before you, and
foreigners, as all our fathers were. Our days on the earth are as a
shadow, and there is no remaining.

<span id="an_29:16">29:16</span> Yahweh our God, all this store that we
have prepared to build you a house for your holy name comes from your
hand, and is all your own.

<span id="an_29:17">29:17</span> I know also, my God, that you try the
heart, and have pleasure in uprightness. As for me, in the uprightness
of my heart I have willingly offered all these things. Now have I seen
with joy your people, that are present here, offer willingly to you.

<span id="an_29:18">29:18</span> Yahweh, the God of Abraham, of Isaac,
and of Israel, our fathers, keep this forever in the imagination of the
thoughts of the heart of your people, and prepare their heart for you;

<span id="an_29:19">29:19</span> and give to Solomon my son a perfect
heart, to keep your commandments, your testimonies, and your statutes,
and to do all these things, and to build the palace, for which I have
made provision."

<span id="an_29:20">29:20</span> David said to all the assembly, "Now
bless Yahweh your God!" All the assembly blessed Yahweh, the God of
their fathers, and bowed down their heads and prostrated themselves
before Yahweh and the king.

<span id="an_29:21">29:21</span> They sacrificed sacrifices to Yahweh,
and offered burnt offerings to Yahweh, on the next day after that day,
even one thousand bulls, one thousand rams, and one thousand lambs, with
their drink offerings, and sacrifices in abundance for all Israel,

<span id="an_29:22">29:22</span> and ate and drink before Yahweh on that
day with great gladness. They made Solomon the son of David king the
second time, and anointed him to Yahweh to be prince, and Zadok to be
priest.

<span id="an_29:23">29:23</span> Then Solomon sat on the throne of
Yahweh as king instead of David his father, and prospered; and all
Israel obeyed him.

<span id="an_29:24">29:24</span> All the princes, the mighty men, and
also all of the sons of king David submitted themselves to Solomon the
king.

<span id="an_29:25">29:25</span> Yahweh magnified Solomon exceedingly in
the sight of all Israel, and bestowed on him such royal majesty as had
not been on any king before him in Israel.

<span id="an_29:26">29:26</span> Now David the son of Jesse reigned over
all Israel.

<span id="an_29:27">29:27</span> The time that he reigned over Israel
was forty years; he reigned seven years in Hebron, and thirty-three
\[years\] reigned he in Jerusalem.

<span id="an_29:28">29:28</span> He died in a good old age, full of
days, riches, and honor: and Solomon his son reigned in his place.

<span id="an_29:29">29:29</span> Now the acts of David the king, first
and last, behold, they are written in the history of Samuel the seer,
and in the history of Nathan the prophet, and in the history of Gad the
seer,

<span id="an_29:30">29:30</span> with all his reign and his might, and
the times that went over him, and over Israel, and over all the kingdoms
of the countries.
