### World English Bible: Joel

<span id="an_1:1">1:1</span> The Word of Yahweh that came to Joel, the
son of Pethuel.

<span id="an_1:2">1:2</span> Hear this, you elders, And listen, all you
inhabitants of the land. Has this ever happened in your days, or in the
days of your fathers?

<span id="an_1:3">1:3</span> Tell your children about it, and have your
children tell their children, and their children, another generation.

<span id="an_1:4">1:4</span> What the swarming locust has left, the
great locust has eaten. What the great locust has left, the grasshopper
has eaten. What the grasshopper has left, the caterpillar has eaten.

<span id="an_1:5">1:5</span> Wake up, you drunkards, and weep! Wail, all
you drinkers of wine, because of the sweet wine; for it is cut off from
your mouth.

<span id="an_1:6">1:6</span> For a nation has come up on my land,
strong, and without number. His teeth are the teeth of a lion, and he
has the fangs of a lioness.

<span id="an_1:7">1:7</span> He has laid my vine waste, and stripped my
fig tree. He has stripped its bark, and thrown it away. Its branches are
made white.

<span id="an_1:8">1:8</span> Mourn like a virgin dressed in sackcloth
for the husband of her youth!

<span id="an_1:9">1:9</span> The meal offering and the drink offering
are cut off from Yahweh's house. The priests, Yahweh's ministers, mourn.

<span id="an_1:10">1:10</span> The field is laid waste. The land mourns,
for the grain is destroyed, The new wine has dried up, and the oil
languishes.

<span id="an_1:11">1:11</span> Be confounded, you farmers! Wail, you
vineyard keepers; for the wheat and for the barley; for the harvest of
the field has perished.

<span id="an_1:12">1:12</span> The vine has dried up, and the fig tree
withered; the pomegranate tree, the palm tree also, and the apple tree,
even all of the trees of the field are withered; for joy has withered
away from the sons of men.

<span id="an_1:13">1:13</span> Put on sackcloth and mourn, you priests!
Wail, you ministers of the altar. Come, lie all night in sackcloth, you
ministers of my God, for the meal offering and the drink offering are
withheld from your God's house.

<span id="an_1:14">1:14</span> Sanctify a fast. Call a solemn assembly.
Gather the elders, and all the inhabitants of the land, to the house of
Yahweh, your God, and cry to Yahweh.

<span id="an_1:15">1:15</span> Alas for the day! For the day of Yahweh
is at hand, and it will come as destruction from the Almighty.

<span id="an_1:16">1:16</span> Isn't the food cut off before our eyes;
joy and gladness from the house of our God?

<span id="an_1:17">1:17</span> The seeds rot under their clods. The
granaries are laid desolate. The barns are broken down, for the grain
has withered.

<span id="an_1:18">1:18</span> How the animals groan! The herds of
livestock are perplexed, because they have no pasture. Yes, the flocks
of sheep are made desolate.

<span id="an_1:19">1:19</span> Yahweh, I cry to you, For the fire has
devoured the pastures of the wilderness, and the flame has burned all
the trees of the field.

<span id="an_1:20">1:20</span> Yes, the animals of the field pant to
you, for the water brooks have dried up, And the fire has devoured the
pastures of the wilderness.

<span id="an_2:1">2:1</span> Blow the trumpet in Zion, and sound an
alarm in my holy mountain! Let all the inhabitants of the land tremble,
for the day of Yahweh comes, for it is close at hand:

<span id="an_2:2">2:2</span> A day of darkness and gloominess, a day of
clouds and thick darkness. As the dawn spreading on the mountains, a
great and strong people; there has never been the like, neither will
there be any more after them, even to the years of many generations.

<span id="an_2:3">2:3</span> A fire devours before them, and behind
them, a flame burns. The land is as the garden of Eden before them, and
behind them, a desolate wilderness. Yes, and no one has escaped them.

<span id="an_2:4">2:4</span> The appearance of them is as the appearance
of horses, and as horsemen, so do they run.

<span id="an_2:5">2:5</span> Like the noise of chariots on the tops of
the mountains do they leap, like the noise of a flame of fire that
devours the stubble, as a strong people set in battle array.

<span id="an_2:6">2:6</span> At their presence the peoples are in
anguish. All faces have grown pale.

<span id="an_2:7">2:7</span> They run like mighty men. They climb the
wall like warriors. They each march in his line, and they don't swerve
off course.

<span id="an_2:8">2:8</span> Neither does one jostle another; they march
everyone in his path, and they burst through the defenses, and don't
break ranks.

<span id="an_2:9">2:9</span> They rush on the city. They run on the
wall. They climb up into the houses. They enter in at the windows like
thieves.

<span id="an_2:10">2:10</span> The earth quakes before them. The heavens
tremble. The sun and the moon are darkened, and the stars withdraw their
shining.

<span id="an_2:11">2:11</span> Yahweh thunders his voice before his
army; for his forces are very great; for he is strong who obeys his
command; for the day of Yahweh is great and very awesome, and who can
endure it?

<span id="an_2:12">2:12</span> "Yet even now," says Yahweh, "turn to me
with all your heart, and with fasting, and with weeping, and with
mourning."

<span id="an_2:13">2:13</span> Tear your heart, and not your garments,
and turn to Yahweh, your God; for he is gracious and merciful, slow to
anger, and abundant in loving kindness, and relents from sending
calamity.

<span id="an_2:14">2:14</span> Who knows? He may turn and relent, and
leave a blessing behind him, even a meal offering and a drink offering
to Yahweh, your God.

<span id="an_2:15">2:15</span> Blow the trumpet in Zion! Sanctify a
fast. Call a solemn assembly.

<span id="an_2:16">2:16</span> Gather the people. Sanctify the assembly.
Assemble the elders. Gather the children, and those who nurse from
breasts. Let the bridegroom go forth from his room, and the bride out of
her room.

<span id="an_2:17">2:17</span> Let the priests, the ministers of Yahweh,
weep between the porch and the altar, and let them say, "Spare your
people, Yahweh, and don't give your heritage to reproach, that the
nations should rule over them. Why should they say among the peoples,
'Where is their God?'"

<span id="an_2:18">2:18</span> Then Yahweh was jealous for his land, And
had pity on his people.

<span id="an_2:19">2:19</span> Yahweh answered his people, "Behold, I
will send you grain, new wine, and oil, and you will be satisfied with
them; and I will no more make you a reproach among the nations.

<span id="an_2:20">2:20</span> But I will remove the northern army far
away from you, and will drive it into a barren and desolate land, its
front into the eastern sea, and its back into the western sea; and its
stench will come up, and its bad smell will rise." Surely he has done
great things.

<span id="an_2:21">2:21</span> Land, don't be afraid. Be glad and
rejoice, for Yahweh has done great things.

<span id="an_2:22">2:22</span> Don't be afraid, you animals of the
field; for the pastures of the wilderness spring up, for the tree bears
its fruit. The fig tree and the vine yield their strength.

<span id="an_2:23">2:23</span> "Be glad then, you children of Zion, and
rejoice in Yahweh, your God; for he gives you the former rain in just
measure, and he causes the rain to come down for you, the former rain
and the latter rain, as before.

<span id="an_2:24">2:24</span> The threshing floors will be full of
wheat, and the vats will overflow with new wine and oil.

<span id="an_2:25">2:25</span> I will restore to you the years that the
swarming locust has eaten, the great locust, the grasshopper, and the
caterpillar, my great army, which I sent among you.

<span id="an_2:26">2:26</span> You will have plenty to eat, and be
satisfied, and will praise the name of Yahweh, your God, who has dealt
wondrously with you; and my people will never again be disappointed.

<span id="an_2:27">2:27</span> You will know that I am in the midst of
Israel, and that I am Yahweh, your God, and there is no one else; and my
people will never again be disappointed.

<span id="an_2:28">2:28</span> "It will happen afterward, that I will
pour out my Spirit on all flesh; and your sons and your daughters will
prophesy. Your old men will dream dreams. Your young men will see
visions.

<span id="an_2:29">2:29</span> And also on the servants and on the
handmaids in those days, I will pour out my Spirit.

<span id="an_2:30">2:30</span> I will show wonders in the heavens and in
the earth: blood, fire, and pillars of smoke.

<span id="an_2:31">2:31</span> The sun will be turned into darkness, and
the moon into blood, before the great and terrible day of Yahweh comes.

<span id="an_2:32">2:32</span> It will happen that whoever will call on
the name of Yahweh shall be saved; for in Mount Zion and in Jerusalem
there will be those who escape, as Yahweh has said, and among the
remnant, those whom Yahweh calls.

<span id="an_3:1">3:1</span> "For, behold, in those days, and in that
time, when I restore the fortunes of Judah and Jerusalem,

<span id="an_3:2">3:2</span> I will gather all nations, and will bring
them down into the valley of Jehoshaphat; and I will execute judgment on
them there for my people, and for my heritage, Israel, whom they have
scattered among the nations. They have divided my land,

<span id="an_3:3">3:3</span> and have cast lots for my people, and have
given a boy for a prostitute, and sold a girl for wine, that they may
drink.

<span id="an_3:4">3:4</span> "Yes, and what are you to me, Tyre, and
Sidon, and all the regions of Philistia? Will you repay me? And if you
repay me, I will swiftly and speedily return your repayment on your own
head.

<span id="an_3:5">3:5</span> Because you have taken my silver and my
gold, and have carried my finest treasures into your temples,

<span id="an_3:6">3:6</span> and have sold the children of Judah and the
children of Jerusalem to the sons of the Greeks, that you may remove
them far from their border.

<span id="an_3:7">3:7</span> Behold, I will stir them up out of the
place where you have sold them, and will return your repayment on your
own head;

<span id="an_3:8">3:8</span> and I will sell your sons and your
daughters into the hands of the children of Judah, and they will sell
them to the men of Sheba, to a faraway nation, for Yahweh has spoken
it."

<span id="an_3:9">3:9</span> Proclaim this among the nations: "Prepare
for war! Stir up the mighty men. Let all the warriors draw near. Let
them come up.

<span id="an_3:10">3:10</span> Beat your plowshares into swords, and
your pruning hooks into spears. Let the weak say, 'I am strong.'

<span id="an_3:11">3:11</span> Hurry and come, all you surrounding
nations, and gather yourselves together." Cause your mighty ones to come
down there, Yahweh.

<span id="an_3:12">3:12</span> "Let the nations arouse themselves, and
come up to the valley of Jehoshaphat; for there will I sit to judge all
the surrounding nations.

<span id="an_3:13">3:13</span> Put in the sickle; for the harvest is
ripe. Come, tread, for the winepress is full, the vats overflow, for
their wickedness is great."

<span id="an_3:14">3:14</span> Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of
decision! For the day of Yahweh is near, in the valley of decision.

<span id="an_3:15">3:15</span> The sun and the moon are darkened, and
the stars withdraw their shining.

<span id="an_3:16">3:16</span> Yahweh will roar from Zion, and thunder
from Jerusalem; and the heavens and the earth will shake; but Yahweh
will be a refuge to his people, and a stronghold to the children of
Israel.

<span id="an_3:17">3:17</span> "So you will know that I am Yahweh, your
God, dwelling in Zion, my holy mountain. Then Jerusalem will be holy,
and no strangers will pass through her any more.

<span id="an_3:18">3:18</span> It will happen in that day, that the
mountains will drop down sweet wine, the hills will flow with milk, all
the brooks of Judah will flow with waters, and a fountain will come
forth from the house of Yahweh, and will water the valley of Shittim.

<span id="an_3:19">3:19</span> Egypt will be a desolation, and Edom will
be a desolate wilderness, for the violence done to the children of
Judah, because they have shed innocent blood in their land.

<span id="an_3:20">3:20</span> But Judah will be inhabited forever, and
Jerusalem from generation to generation.

<span id="an_3:21">3:21</span> I will cleanse their blood, that I have
not cleansed: for Yahweh dwells in Zion."
