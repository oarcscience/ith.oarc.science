### World English Bible: Job

<span id="an_1:1">1:1</span> There was a man in the land of Uz, whose
name was Job. That man was blameless and upright, and one who feared
God, and turned away from evil.

<span id="an_1:2">1:2</span> There were born to him seven sons and three
daughters.

<span id="an_1:3">1:3</span> His possessions also were seven thousand
sheep, three thousand camels, five hundred yoke of oxen, five hundred
female donkeys, and a very great household; so that this man was the
greatest of all the children of the east.

<span id="an_1:4">1:4</span> His sons went and held a feast in the house
of each one on his birthday; and they sent and called for their three
sisters to eat and to drink with them.

<span id="an_1:5">1:5</span> It was so, when the days of their feasting
had run their course, that Job sent and sanctified them, and rose up
early in the morning, and offered burnt offerings according to the
number of them all. For Job said, "It may be that my sons have sinned,
and renounced God in their hearts." Job did so continually.

<span id="an_1:6">1:6</span> Now it happened on the day when God's sons
came to present themselves before Yahweh, that Satan also came among
them.

<span id="an_1:7">1:7</span> Yahweh said to Satan, "Where have you come
from?" Then Satan answered Yahweh, and said, "From going back and forth
in the earth, and from walking up and down in it."

<span id="an_1:8">1:8</span> Yahweh said to Satan, "Have you considered
my servant, Job? For there is none like him in the earth, a blameless
and an upright man, one who fears God, and turns away from evil."

<span id="an_1:9">1:9</span> Then Satan answered Yahweh, and said, "Does
Job fear God for nothing?

<span id="an_1:10">1:10</span> Haven't you made a hedge around him, and
around his house, and around all that he has, on every side? You have
blessed the work of his hands, and his substance is increased in the
land.

<span id="an_1:11">1:11</span> But put forth your hand now, and touch
all that he has, and he will renounce you to your face."

<span id="an_1:12">1:12</span> Yahweh said to Satan, "Behold, all that
he has is in your power. Only on himself don't put forth your hand." So
Satan went forth from the presence of Yahweh.

<span id="an_1:13">1:13</span> It fell on a day when his sons and his
daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house,

<span id="an_1:14">1:14</span> that there came a messenger to Job, and
said, "The oxen were plowing, and the donkeys feeding beside them,

<span id="an_1:15">1:15</span> and the Sabeans attacked, and took them
away. Yes, they have killed the servants with the edge of the sword, and
I alone have escaped to tell you."

<span id="an_1:16">1:16</span> While he was still speaking, there also
came another, and said, "The fire of God has fallen from the sky, and
has burned up the sheep and the servants, and consumed them, and I alone
have escaped to tell you."

<span id="an_1:17">1:17</span> While he was still speaking, there came
also another, and said, "The Chaldeans made three bands, and swept down
on the camels, and have taken them away, yes, and killed the servants
with the edge of the sword; and I alone have escaped to tell you."

<span id="an_1:18">1:18</span> While he was still speaking, there came
also another, and said, "Your sons and your daughters were eating and
drinking wine in their eldest brother's house,

<span id="an_1:19">1:19</span> and behold, there came a great wind from
the wilderness, and struck the four corners of the house, and it fell on
the young men, and they are dead. I alone have escaped to tell you."

<span id="an_1:20">1:20</span> Then Job arose, and tore his robe, and
shaved his head, and fell down on the ground, and worshiped.

<span id="an_1:21">1:21</span> He said, "Naked I came out of my mother's
womb, and naked shall I return there. Yahweh gave, and Yahweh has taken
away. Blessed be the name of Yahweh."

<span id="an_1:22">1:22</span> In all this, Job did not sin, nor charge
God with wrongdoing.

<span id="an_2:1">2:1</span> Again it happened on the day when the God's
sons came to present themselves before Yahweh, that Satan came also
among them to present himself before Yahweh.

<span id="an_2:2">2:2</span> Yahweh said to Satan, "Where have you come
from?" Satan answered Yahweh, and said, "From going back and forth in
the earth, and from walking up and down in it."

<span id="an_2:3">2:3</span> Yahweh said to Satan, "Have you considered
my servant Job? For there is none like him in the earth, a blameless and
an upright man, one who fears God, and turns away from evil. He still
maintains his integrity, although you incited me against him, to ruin
him without cause."

<span id="an_2:4">2:4</span> Satan answered Yahweh, and said, "Skin for
skin. Yes, all that a man has he will give for his life.

<span id="an_2:5">2:5</span> But put forth your hand now, and touch his
bone and his flesh, and he will renounce you to your face."

<span id="an_2:6">2:6</span> Yahweh said to Satan, "Behold, he is in
your hand. Only spare his life."

<span id="an_2:7">2:7</span> So Satan went forth from the presence of
Yahweh, and struck Job with painful sores from the sole of his foot to
his head.

<span id="an_2:8">2:8</span> He took for himself a potsherd to scrape
himself with, and he sat among the ashes.

<span id="an_2:9">2:9</span> Then his wife said to him, "Do you still
maintain your integrity? Renounce God, and die."

<span id="an_2:10">2:10</span> But he said to her, "You speak as one of
the foolish women would speak. What? Shall we receive good at the hand
of God, and shall we not receive evil?" In all this Job didn't sin with
his lips.

<span id="an_2:11">2:11</span> Now when Job's three friends heard of all
this evil that had come on him, they each came from his own place:
Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite, and
they made an appointment together to come to sympathize with him and to
comfort him.

<span id="an_2:12">2:12</span> When they lifted up their eyes from a
distance, and didn't recognize him, they raised their voices, and wept;
and they each tore his robe, and sprinkled dust on their heads toward
the sky.

<span id="an_2:13">2:13</span> So they sat down with him on the ground
seven days and seven nights, and none spoke a word to him, for they saw
that his grief was very great.

<span id="an_3:1">3:1</span> After this Job opened his mouth, and cursed
the day of his birth.

<span id="an_3:2">3:2</span> Job answered:

<span id="an_3:3">3:3</span> "Let the day perish in which I was born,
the night which said, 'There is a boy conceived.'

<span id="an_3:4">3:4</span> Let that day be darkness. Don't let God
from above seek for it, neither let the light shine on it.

<span id="an_3:5">3:5</span> Let darkness and the shadow of death claim
it for their own. Let a cloud dwell on it. Let all that makes black the
day terrify it.

<span id="an_3:6">3:6</span> As for that night, let thick darkness seize
on it. Let it not rejoice among the days of the year. Let it not come
into the number of the months.

<span id="an_3:7">3:7</span> Behold, let that night be barren. Let no
joyful voice come therein.

<span id="an_3:8">3:8</span> Let them curse it who curse the day, who
are ready to rouse up leviathan.

<span id="an_3:9">3:9</span> Let the stars of its twilight be dark. Let
it look for light, but have none, neither let it see the eyelids of the
morning,

<span id="an_3:10">3:10</span> because it didn't shut up the doors of my
mother's womb, nor did it hide trouble from my eyes.

<span id="an_3:11">3:11</span> "Why didn't I die from the womb? Why
didn't I give up the spirit when my mother bore me?

<span id="an_3:12">3:12</span> Why did the knees receive me? Or why the
breast, that I should nurse?

<span id="an_3:13">3:13</span> For now should I have lain down and been
quiet. I should have slept, then I would have been at rest,

<span id="an_3:14">3:14</span> with kings and counselors of the earth,
who built up waste places for themselves;

<span id="an_3:15">3:15</span> or with princes who had gold, who filled
their houses with silver:

<span id="an_3:16">3:16</span> or as a hidden untimely birth I had not
been, as infants who never saw light.

<span id="an_3:17">3:17</span> There the wicked cease from troubling.
There the weary are at rest.

<span id="an_3:18">3:18</span> There the prisoners are at ease together.
They don't hear the voice of the taskmaster.

<span id="an_3:19">3:19</span> The small and the great are there. The
servant is free from his master.

<span id="an_3:20">3:20</span> "Why is light given to him who is in
misery, life to the bitter in soul,

<span id="an_3:21">3:21</span> Who long for death, but it doesn't come;
and dig for it more than for hidden treasures,

<span id="an_3:22">3:22</span> who rejoice exceedingly, and are glad,
when they can find the grave?

<span id="an_3:23">3:23</span> Why is light given to a man whose way is
hidden, whom God has hedged in?

<span id="an_3:24">3:24</span> For my sighing comes before I eat. My
groanings are poured out like water.

<span id="an_3:25">3:25</span> For the thing which I fear comes on me,
That which I am afraid of comes to me.

<span id="an_3:26">3:26</span> I am not at ease, neither am I quiet,
neither have I rest; but trouble comes."

<span id="an_4:1">4:1</span> Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered,

<span id="an_4:2">4:2</span> "If someone ventures to talk with you, will
you be grieved? But who can withhold himself from speaking?

<span id="an_4:3">4:3</span> Behold, you have instructed many, you have
strengthened the weak hands.

<span id="an_4:4">4:4</span> Your words have supported him who was
falling, You have made firm the feeble knees.

<span id="an_4:5">4:5</span> But now it is come to you, and you faint.
It touches you, and you are troubled.

<span id="an_4:6">4:6</span> Isn't your piety your confidence? Isn't the
integrity of your ways your hope?

<span id="an_4:7">4:7</span> "Remember, now, whoever perished, being
innocent? Or where were the upright cut off?

<span id="an_4:8">4:8</span> According to what I have seen, those who
plow iniquity, and sow trouble, reap the same.

<span id="an_4:9">4:9</span> By the breath of God they perish. By the
blast of his anger are they consumed.

<span id="an_4:10">4:10</span> The roaring of the lion, and the voice of
the fierce lion, the teeth of the young lions, are broken.

<span id="an_4:11">4:11</span> The old lion perishes for lack of prey.
The cubs of the lioness are scattered abroad.

<span id="an_4:12">4:12</span> "Now a thing was secretly brought to me.
My ear received a whisper of it.

<span id="an_4:13">4:13</span> In thoughts from the visions of the
night, when deep sleep falls on men,

<span id="an_4:14">4:14</span> fear came on me, and trembling, which
made all my bones shake.

<span id="an_4:15">4:15</span> Then a spirit passed before my face. The
hair of my flesh stood up.

<span id="an_4:16">4:16</span> It stood still, but I couldn't discern
its appearance. A form was before my eyes. Silence, then I heard a
voice, saying,

<span id="an_4:17">4:17</span> 'Shall mortal man be more just than God?
Shall a man be more pure than his Maker?

<span id="an_4:18">4:18</span> Behold, he puts no trust in his servants.
He charges his angels with error.

<span id="an_4:19">4:19</span> How much more, those who dwell in houses
of clay, whose foundation is in the dust, who are crushed before the
moth!

<span id="an_4:20">4:20</span> Between morning and evening they are
destroyed. They perish forever without any regarding it.

<span id="an_4:21">4:21</span> Isn't their tent cord plucked up within
them? They die, and that without wisdom.'

<span id="an_5:1">5:1</span> "Call now; is there any who will answer
you? To which of the holy ones will you turn?

<span id="an_5:2">5:2</span> For resentment kills the foolish man, and
jealousy kills the simple.

<span id="an_5:3">5:3</span> I have seen the foolish taking root, but
suddenly I cursed his habitation.

<span id="an_5:4">5:4</span> His children are far from safety. They are
crushed in the gate. Neither is there any to deliver them,

<span id="an_5:5">5:5</span> whose harvest the hungry eats up, and take
it even out of the thorns. The snare gapes for their substance.

<span id="an_5:6">5:6</span> For affliction doesn't come forth from the
dust, neither does trouble spring out of the ground;

<span id="an_5:7">5:7</span> but man is born to trouble, as the sparks
fly upward.

<span id="an_5:8">5:8</span> "But as for me, I would seek God. I would
commit my cause to God,

<span id="an_5:9">5:9</span> who does great things that can't be
fathomed, marvelous things without number;

<span id="an_5:10">5:10</span> who gives rain on the earth, and sends
waters on the fields;

<span id="an_5:11">5:11</span> so that he sets up on high those who are
low, those who mourn are exalted to safety.

<span id="an_5:12">5:12</span> He frustrates the devices of the crafty,
So that their hands can't perform their enterprise.

<span id="an_5:13">5:13</span> He takes the wise in their own
craftiness; the counsel of the cunning is carried headlong.

<span id="an_5:14">5:14</span> They meet with darkness in the day time,
and grope at noonday as in the night.

<span id="an_5:15">5:15</span> But he saves from the sword of their
mouth, even the needy from the hand of the mighty.

<span id="an_5:16">5:16</span> So the poor has hope, and injustice shuts
her mouth.

<span id="an_5:17">5:17</span> "Behold, happy is the man whom God
corrects. Therefore do not despise the chastening of the Almighty.

<span id="an_5:18">5:18</span> For he wounds, and binds up. He injures,
and his hands make whole.

<span id="an_5:19">5:19</span> He will deliver you in six troubles; yes,
in seven no evil shall touch you.

<span id="an_5:20">5:20</span> In famine he will redeem you from death;
in war, from the power of the sword.

<span id="an_5:21">5:21</span> You shall be hidden from the scourge of
the tongue, neither shall you be afraid of destruction when it comes.

<span id="an_5:22">5:22</span> At destruction and famine you shall
laugh, neither shall you be afraid of the animals of the earth.

<span id="an_5:23">5:23</span> For you shall be allied with the stones
of the field. The animals of the field shall be at peace with you.

<span id="an_5:24">5:24</span> You shall know that your tent is in
peace. You shall visit your fold, and shall miss nothing.

<span id="an_5:25">5:25</span> You shall know also that your seed shall
be great, Your offspring as the grass of the earth.

<span id="an_5:26">5:26</span> You shall come to your grave in a full
age, like a shock of grain comes in its season.

<span id="an_5:27">5:27</span> Look this, we have searched it, so it is.
Hear it, and know it for your good."

<span id="an_6:1">6:1</span> Then Job answered,

<span id="an_6:2">6:2</span> "Oh that my anguish were weighed, and all
my calamity laid in the balances!

<span id="an_6:3">6:3</span> For now it would be heavier than the sand
of the seas, therefore have my words been rash.

<span id="an_6:4">6:4</span> For the arrows of the Almighty are within
me. My spirit drinks up their poison. The terrors of God set themselves
in array against me.

<span id="an_6:5">6:5</span> Does the wild donkey bray when he has
grass? Or does the ox low over his fodder?

<span id="an_6:6">6:6</span> Can that which has no flavor be eaten
without salt? Or is there any taste in the white of an egg?

<span id="an_6:7">6:7</span> My soul refuses to touch them. They are as
loathsome food to me.

<span id="an_6:8">6:8</span> "Oh that I might have my request, that God
would grant the thing that I long for,

<span id="an_6:9">6:9</span> even that it would please God to crush me;
that he would let loose his hand, and cut me off!

<span id="an_6:10">6:10</span> Be it still my consolation, yes, let me
exult in pain that doesn't spare, that I have not denied the words of
the Holy One.

<span id="an_6:11">6:11</span> What is my strength, that I should wait?
What is my end, that I should be patient?

<span id="an_6:12">6:12</span> Is my strength the strength of stones? Or
is my flesh of brass?

<span id="an_6:13">6:13</span> Isn't it that I have no help in me, That
wisdom is driven quite from me?

<span id="an_6:14">6:14</span> "To him who is ready to faint, kindness
should be shown from his friend; even to him who forsakes the fear of
the Almighty.

<span id="an_6:15">6:15</span> My brothers have dealt deceitfully as a
brook, as the channel of brooks that pass away;

<span id="an_6:16">6:16</span> Which are black by reason of the ice, in
which the snow hides itself.

<span id="an_6:17">6:17</span> In the dry season, they vanish. When it
is hot, they are consumed out of their place.

<span id="an_6:18">6:18</span> The caravans that travel beside them turn
aside. They go up into the waste, and perish.

<span id="an_6:19">6:19</span> The caravans of Tema looked. The
companies of Sheba waited for them.

<span id="an_6:20">6:20</span> They were distressed because they were
confident. They came there, and were confounded.

<span id="an_6:21">6:21</span> For now you are nothing. You see a
terror, and are afraid.

<span id="an_6:22">6:22</span> Did I say, 'Give to me?' or, 'Offer a
present for me from your substance?'

<span id="an_6:23">6:23</span> or, 'Deliver me from the adversary's
hand?' or, 'Redeem me from the hand of the oppressors?'

<span id="an_6:24">6:24</span> "Teach me, and I will hold my peace.
Cause me to understand wherein I have erred.

<span id="an_6:25">6:25</span> How forcible are words of uprightness!
But your reproof, what does it reprove?

<span id="an_6:26">6:26</span> Do you intend to reprove words, since the
speeches of one who is desperate are as wind?

<span id="an_6:27">6:27</span> Yes, you would even cast lots for the
fatherless, and make merchandise of your friend.

<span id="an_6:28">6:28</span> Now therefore be pleased to look at me,
for surely I shall not lie to your face.

<span id="an_6:29">6:29</span> Please return. Let there be no injustice.
Yes, return again. My cause is righteous.

<span id="an_6:30">6:30</span> Is there injustice on my tongue? Can't my
taste discern mischievous things?

<span id="an_7:1">7:1</span> "Isn't a man forced to labor on earth?
Aren't his days like the days of a hired hand?

<span id="an_7:2">7:2</span> As a servant who earnestly desires the
shadow, as a hireling who looks for his wages,

<span id="an_7:3">7:3</span> so am I made to possess months of misery,
wearisome nights are appointed to me.

<span id="an_7:4">7:4</span> When I lie down, I say, 'When shall I
arise, and the night be gone?' I toss and turn until the dawning of the
day.

<span id="an_7:5">7:5</span> My flesh is clothed with worms and clods of
dust. My skin closes up, and breaks out afresh.

<span id="an_7:6">7:6</span> My days are swifter than a weaver's
shuttle, and are spent without hope.

<span id="an_7:7">7:7</span> Oh remember that my life is a breath. My
eye shall no more see good.

<span id="an_7:8">7:8</span> The eye of him who sees me shall see me no
more. Your eyes shall be on me, but I shall not be.

<span id="an_7:9">7:9</span> As the cloud is consumed and vanishes away,
so he who goes down to Sheol shall come up no more.

<span id="an_7:10">7:10</span> He shall return no more to his house,
neither shall his place know him any more.

<span id="an_7:11">7:11</span> "Therefore I will not keep silent. I will
speak in the anguish of my spirit. I will complain in the bitterness of
my soul.

<span id="an_7:12">7:12</span> Am I a sea, or a sea monster, that you
put a guard over me?

<span id="an_7:13">7:13</span> When I say, 'My bed shall comfort me. My
couch shall ease my complaint;'

<span id="an_7:14">7:14</span> then you scare me with dreams, and
terrify me through visions:

<span id="an_7:15">7:15</span> so that my soul chooses strangling, death
rather than my bones.

<span id="an_7:16">7:16</span> I loathe my life. I don't want to live
forever. Leave me alone, for my days are but a breath.

<span id="an_7:17">7:17</span> What is man, that you should magnify him,
that you should set your mind on him,

<span id="an_7:18">7:18</span> that you should visit him every morning,
and test him every moment?

<span id="an_7:19">7:19</span> How long will you not look away from me,
nor leave me alone until I swallow down my spittle?

<span id="an_7:20">7:20</span> If I have sinned, what do I do to you,
you watcher of men? Why have you set me as a mark for you, so that I am
a burden to myself?

<span id="an_7:21">7:21</span> Why do you not pardon my disobedience,
and take away my iniquity? For now shall I lie down in the dust. You
will seek me diligently, but I shall not be."

<span id="an_8:1">8:1</span> Then Bildad the Shuhite answered,

<span id="an_8:2">8:2</span> "How long will you speak these things?
Shall the words of your mouth be a mighty wind?

<span id="an_8:3">8:3</span> Does God pervert justice? Or does the
Almighty pervert righteousness?

<span id="an_8:4">8:4</span> If your children have sinned against him,
He has delivered them into the hand of their disobedience.

<span id="an_8:5">8:5</span> If you want to seek God diligently, make
your supplication to the Almighty.

<span id="an_8:6">8:6</span> If you were pure and upright, surely now he
would awaken for you, and make the habitation of your righteousness
prosperous.

<span id="an_8:7">8:7</span> Though your beginning was small, yet your
latter end would greatly increase.

<span id="an_8:8">8:8</span> "Please inquire of past generations. Find
out about the learning of their fathers.

<span id="an_8:9">8:9</span> (For we are but of yesterday, and know
nothing, because our days on earth are a shadow.)

<span id="an_8:10">8:10</span> Shall they not teach you, tell you, and
utter words out of their heart?

<span id="an_8:11">8:11</span> "Can the papyrus grow up without mire?
Can the rushes grow without water?

<span id="an_8:12">8:12</span> While it is yet in its greenness, not cut
down, it withers before any other reed.

<span id="an_8:13">8:13</span> So are the paths of all who forget God.
The hope of the godless man shall perish,

<span id="an_8:14">8:14</span> Whose confidence shall break apart, Whose
trust is a spider's web.

<span id="an_8:15">8:15</span> He shall lean on his house, but it shall
not stand. He shall cling to it, but it shall not endure.

<span id="an_8:16">8:16</span> He is green before the sun. His shoots go
forth over his garden.

<span id="an_8:17">8:17</span> His roots are wrapped around the rock
pile. He sees the place of stones.

<span id="an_8:18">8:18</span> If he is destroyed from his place, then
it shall deny him, saying, 'I have not seen you.'

<span id="an_8:19">8:19</span> Behold, this is the joy of his way: out
of the earth, others shall spring.

<span id="an_8:20">8:20</span> "Behold, God will not cast away a
blameless man, neither will he uphold the evildoers.

<span id="an_8:21">8:21</span> He will still fill your mouth with
laughter, your lips with shouting.

<span id="an_8:22">8:22</span> Those who hate you shall be clothed with
shame. The tent of the wicked shall be no more."

<span id="an_9:1">9:1</span> Then Job answered,

<span id="an_9:2">9:2</span> "Truly I know that it is so, but how can
man be just with God?

<span id="an_9:3">9:3</span> If he is pleased to contend with him, he
can't answer him one time in a thousand.

<span id="an_9:4">9:4</span> God who is wise in heart, and mighty in
strength: who has hardened himself against him, and prospered?

<span id="an_9:5">9:5</span> He removes the mountains, and they don't
know it, when he overturns them in his anger.

<span id="an_9:6">9:6</span> He shakes the earth out of its place. Its
pillars tremble.

<span id="an_9:7">9:7</span> He commands the sun, and it doesn't rise,
and seals up the stars.

<span id="an_9:8">9:8</span> He alone stretches out the heavens, and
treads on the waves of the sea.

<span id="an_9:9">9:9</span> He makes the Bear, Orion, and the Pleiades,
and the rooms of the south.

<span id="an_9:10">9:10</span> He does great things past finding out;
yes, marvelous things without number.

<span id="an_9:11">9:11</span> Behold, he goes by me, and I don't see
him. He passes on also, but I don't perceive him.

<span id="an_9:12">9:12</span> Behold, he snatches away. Who can hinder
him? Who will ask him, 'What are you doing?'

<span id="an_9:13">9:13</span> "God will not withdraw his anger. The
helpers of Rahab stoop under him.

<span id="an_9:14">9:14</span> How much less shall I answer him, And
choose my words to argue with him?

<span id="an_9:15">9:15</span> Though I were righteous, yet I wouldn't
answer him. I would make supplication to my judge.

<span id="an_9:16">9:16</span> If I had called, and he had answered me,
yet I wouldn't believe that he listened to my voice.

<span id="an_9:17">9:17</span> For he breaks me with a storm, and
multiplies my wounds without cause.

<span id="an_9:18">9:18</span> He will not allow me to catch my breath,
but fills me with bitterness.

<span id="an_9:19">9:19</span> If it is a matter of strength, behold, he
is mighty! If of justice, 'Who,' says he, 'will summon me?'

<span id="an_9:20">9:20</span> Though I am righteous, my own mouth shall
condemn me. Though I am blameless, it shall prove me perverse.

<span id="an_9:21">9:21</span> I am blameless. I don't respect myself. I
despise my life.

<span id="an_9:22">9:22</span> "It is all the same. Therefore I say he
destroys the blameless and the wicked.

<span id="an_9:23">9:23</span> If the scourge kills suddenly, he will
mock at the trial of the innocent.

<span id="an_9:24">9:24</span> The earth is given into the hand of the
wicked. He covers the faces of its judges. If not he, then who is it?

<span id="an_9:25">9:25</span> "Now my days are swifter than a runner.
They flee away, they see no good,

<span id="an_9:26">9:26</span> They have passed away as the swift ships,
as the eagle that swoops on the prey.

<span id="an_9:27">9:27</span> If I say, 'I will forget my complaint, I
will put off my sad face, and cheer up;'

<span id="an_9:28">9:28</span> I am afraid of all my sorrows, I know
that you will not hold me innocent.

<span id="an_9:29">9:29</span> I shall be condemned. Why then do I labor
in vain?

<span id="an_9:30">9:30</span> If I wash myself with snow, and cleanse
my hands with lye,

<span id="an_9:31">9:31</span> yet you will plunge me in the ditch. My
own clothes shall abhor me.

<span id="an_9:32">9:32</span> For he is not a man, as I am, that I
should answer him, that we should come together in judgment.

<span id="an_9:33">9:33</span> There is no umpire between us, that might
lay his hand on us both.

<span id="an_9:34">9:34</span> Let him take his rod away from me. Let
his terror not make me afraid;

<span id="an_9:35">9:35</span> then I would speak, and not fear him, for
I am not so in myself.

<span id="an_10:1">10:1</span> "My soul is weary of my life. I will give
free course to my complaint. I will speak in the bitterness of my soul.

<span id="an_10:2">10:2</span> I will tell God, 'Do not condemn me. Show
me why you contend with me.

<span id="an_10:3">10:3</span> Is it good to you that you should
oppress, that you should despise the work of your hands, and smile on
the counsel of the wicked?

<span id="an_10:4">10:4</span> Do you have eyes of flesh? Or do you see
as man sees?

<span id="an_10:5">10:5</span> Are your days as the days of mortals, or
your years as man's years,

<span id="an_10:6">10:6</span> that you inquire after my iniquity, and
search after my sin?

<span id="an_10:7">10:7</span> Although you know that I am not wicked,
there is no one who can deliver out of your hand.

<span id="an_10:8">10:8</span> "'Your hands have framed me and fashioned
me altogether, yet you destroy me.

<span id="an_10:9">10:9</span> Remember, I beg you, that you have
fashioned me as clay. Will you bring me into dust again?

<span id="an_10:10">10:10</span> Haven't you poured me out like milk,
and curdled me like cheese?

<span id="an_10:11">10:11</span> You have clothed me with skin and
flesh, and knit me together with bones and sinews.

<span id="an_10:12">10:12</span> You have granted me life and loving
kindness. Your visitation has preserved my spirit.

<span id="an_10:13">10:13</span> Yet you hid these things in your heart.
I know that this is with you:

<span id="an_10:14">10:14</span> if I sin, then you mark me. You will
not acquit me from my iniquity.

<span id="an_10:15">10:15</span> If I am wicked, woe to me. If I am
righteous, I still shall not lift up my head, being filled with
disgrace, and conscious of my affliction.

<span id="an_10:16">10:16</span> If my head is held high, you hunt me
like a lion. Again you show yourself powerful to me.

<span id="an_10:17">10:17</span> You renew your witnesses against me,
and increase your indignation on me. Changes and warfare are with me.

<span id="an_10:18">10:18</span> "'Why, then, have you brought me forth
out of the womb? I wish I had given up the spirit, and no eye had seen
me.

<span id="an_10:19">10:19</span> I should have been as though I had not
been. I should have been carried from the womb to the grave.

<span id="an_10:20">10:20</span> Aren't my days few? Cease then. Leave
me alone, that I may find a little comfort,

<span id="an_10:21">10:21</span> before I go where I shall not return
from, to the land of darkness and of the shadow of death;

<span id="an_10:22">10:22</span> the land dark as midnight, of the
shadow of death, without any order, where the light is as midnight.'"

<span id="an_11:1">11:1</span> Then Zophar, the Naamathite, answered,

<span id="an_11:2">11:2</span> "Shouldn't the multitude of words be
answered? Should a man full of talk be justified?

<span id="an_11:3">11:3</span> Should your boastings make men hold their
peace? When you mock, shall no man make you ashamed?

<span id="an_11:4">11:4</span> For you say, 'My doctrine is pure. I am
clean in your eyes.'

<span id="an_11:5">11:5</span> But oh that God would speak, and open his
lips against you,

<span id="an_11:6">11:6</span> that he would show you the secrets of
wisdom! For true wisdom has two sides. Know therefore that God exacts of
you less than your iniquity deserves.

<span id="an_11:7">11:7</span> "Can you fathom the mystery of God? Or
can you probe the limits of the Almighty?

<span id="an_11:8">11:8</span> They are high as heaven. What can you do?
They are deeper than Sheol. What can you know?

<span id="an_11:9">11:9</span> Its measure is longer than the earth, and
broader than the sea.

<span id="an_11:10">11:10</span> If he passes by, or confines, or
convenes a court, then who can oppose him?

<span id="an_11:11">11:11</span> For he knows false men. He sees
iniquity also, even though he doesn't consider it.

<span id="an_11:12">11:12</span> An empty-headed man becomes wise when a
man is born as a wild donkey's colt.

<span id="an_11:13">11:13</span> "If you set your heart aright, stretch
out your hands toward him.

<span id="an_11:14">11:14</span> If iniquity is in your hand, put it far
away. Don't let unrighteousness dwell in your tents.

<span id="an_11:15">11:15</span> Surely then you shall lift up your face
without spot; Yes, you shall be steadfast, and shall not fear:

<span id="an_11:16">11:16</span> for you shall forget your misery. You
shall remember it as waters that are passed away.

<span id="an_11:17">11:17</span> Life shall be clearer than the noonday.
Though there is darkness, it shall be as the morning.

<span id="an_11:18">11:18</span> You shall be secure, because there is
hope. Yes, you shall search, and shall take your rest in safety.

<span id="an_11:19">11:19</span> Also you shall lie down, and none shall
make you afraid. Yes, many shall court your favor.

<span id="an_11:20">11:20</span> But the eyes of the wicked shall fail.
They shall have no way to flee. Their hope shall be the giving up of the
spirit."

<span id="an_12:1">12:1</span> Then Job answered,

<span id="an_12:2">12:2</span> "No doubt, but you are the people, and
wisdom shall die with you.

<span id="an_12:3">12:3</span> But I have understanding as well as you;
I am not inferior to you. Yes, who doesn't know such things as these?

<span id="an_12:4">12:4</span> I am like one who is a joke to his
neighbor, I, who called on God, and he answered. The just, the blameless
man is a joke.

<span id="an_12:5">12:5</span> In the thought of him who is at ease
there is contempt for misfortune. It is ready for them whose foot slips.

<span id="an_12:6">12:6</span> The tents of robbers prosper. Those who
provoke God are secure, who carry their God in their hands.

<span id="an_12:7">12:7</span> "But ask the animals, now, and they shall
teach you; the birds of the sky, and they shall tell you.

<span id="an_12:8">12:8</span> Or speak to the earth, and it shall teach
you. The fish of the sea shall declare to you.

<span id="an_12:9">12:9</span> Who doesn't know that in all these, the
hand of Yahweh has done this,

<span id="an_12:10">12:10</span> in whose hand is the life of every
living thing, and the breath of all mankind?

<span id="an_12:11">12:11</span> Doesn't the ear try words, even as the
palate tastes its food?

<span id="an_12:12">12:12</span> With aged men is wisdom, in length of
days understanding.

<span id="an_12:13">12:13</span> "With God is wisdom and might. He has
counsel and understanding.

<span id="an_12:14">12:14</span> Behold, he breaks down, and it can't be
built again. He imprisons a man, and there can be no release.

<span id="an_12:15">12:15</span> Behold, he withholds the waters, and
they dry up. Again, he sends them out, and they overturn the earth.

<span id="an_12:16">12:16</span> With him is strength and wisdom. The
deceived and the deceiver are his.

<span id="an_12:17">12:17</span> He leads counselors away stripped. He
makes judges fools.

<span id="an_12:18">12:18</span> He loosens the bond of kings. He binds
their waist with a belt.

<span id="an_12:19">12:19</span> He leads priests away stripped, and
overthrows the mighty.

<span id="an_12:20">12:20</span> He removes the speech of those who are
trusted, and takes away the understanding of the elders.

<span id="an_12:21">12:21</span> He pours contempt on princes, and
loosens the belt of the strong.

<span id="an_12:22">12:22</span> He uncovers deep things out of
darkness, and brings out to light the shadow of death.

<span id="an_12:23">12:23</span> He increases the nations, and he
destroys them. He enlarges the nations, and he leads them captive.

<span id="an_12:24">12:24</span> He takes away understanding from the
chiefs of the people of the earth, and causes them to wander in a
wilderness where there is no way.

<span id="an_12:25">12:25</span> They grope in the dark without light.
He makes them stagger like a drunken man.

<span id="an_13:1">13:1</span> "Behold, my eye has seen all this. My ear
has heard and understood it.

<span id="an_13:2">13:2</span> What you know, I know also. I am not
inferior to you.

<span id="an_13:3">13:3</span> "Surely I would speak to the Almighty. I
desire to reason with God.

<span id="an_13:4">13:4</span> But you are forgers of lies. You are all
physicians of no value.

<span id="an_13:5">13:5</span> Oh that you would be completely silent!
Then you would be wise.

<span id="an_13:6">13:6</span> Hear now my reasoning. Listen to the
pleadings of my lips.

<span id="an_13:7">13:7</span> Will you speak unrighteously for God, and
talk deceitfully for him?

<span id="an_13:8">13:8</span> Will you show partiality to him? Will you
contend for God?

<span id="an_13:9">13:9</span> Is it good that he should search you out?
Or as one deceives a man, will you deceive him?

<span id="an_13:10">13:10</span> He will surely reprove you if you
secretly show partiality.

<span id="an_13:11">13:11</span> Shall not his majesty make you afraid,
And his dread fall on you?

<span id="an_13:12">13:12</span> Your memorable sayings are proverbs of
ashes, Your defenses are defenses of clay.

<span id="an_13:13">13:13</span> "Be silent, leave me alone, that I may
speak. Let come on me what will.

<span id="an_13:14">13:14</span> Why should I take my flesh in my teeth,
and put my life in my hand?

<span id="an_13:15">13:15</span> Behold, he will kill me. I have no
hope. Nevertheless, I will maintain my ways before him.

<span id="an_13:16">13:16</span> This also shall be my salvation, that a
godless man shall not come before him.

<span id="an_13:17">13:17</span> Hear diligently my speech. Let my
declaration be in your ears.

<span id="an_13:18">13:18</span> See now, I have set my cause in order.
I know that I am righteous.

<span id="an_13:19">13:19</span> Who is he who will contend with me? For
then would I hold my peace and give up the spirit.

<span id="an_13:20">13:20</span> "Only don't do two things to me; then I
will not hide myself from your face:

<span id="an_13:21">13:21</span> withdraw your hand far from me; and
don't let your terror make me afraid.

<span id="an_13:22">13:22</span> Then call, and I will answer; or let me
speak, and you answer me.

<span id="an_13:23">13:23</span> How many are my iniquities and sins?
Make me know my disobedience and my sin.

<span id="an_13:24">13:24</span> Why hide you your face, and hold me for
your enemy?

<span id="an_13:25">13:25</span> Will you harass a driven leaf? Will you
pursue the dry stubble?

<span id="an_13:26">13:26</span> For you write bitter things against me,
and make me inherit the iniquities of my youth:

<span id="an_13:27">13:27</span> You also put my feet in the stocks, and
mark all my paths. You set a bound to the soles of my feet,

<span id="an_13:28">13:28</span> though I am decaying like a rotten
thing, like a garment that is moth-eaten.

<span id="an_14:1">14:1</span> "Man, who is born of a woman, is of few
days, and full of trouble.

<span id="an_14:2">14:2</span> He comes forth like a flower, and is cut
down. He also flees like a shadow, and doesn't continue.

<span id="an_14:3">14:3</span> Do you open your eyes on such a one, and
bring me into judgment with you?

<span id="an_14:4">14:4</span> Who can bring a clean thing out of an
unclean? Not one.

<span id="an_14:5">14:5</span> Seeing his days are determined, the
number of his months is with you, and you have appointed his bounds that
he can't pass;

<span id="an_14:6">14:6</span> Look away from him, that he may rest,
until he shall accomplish, as a hireling, his day.

<span id="an_14:7">14:7</span> "For there is hope for a tree, If it is
cut down, that it will sprout again, that the tender branch of it will
not cease.

<span id="an_14:8">14:8</span> Though its root grows old in the earth,
and its stock dies in the ground,

<span id="an_14:9">14:9</span> yet through the scent of water it will
bud, and put forth boughs like a plant.

<span id="an_14:10">14:10</span> But man dies, and is laid low. Yes, man
gives up the spirit, and where is he?

<span id="an_14:11">14:11</span> As the waters fail from the sea, and
the river wastes and dries up,

<span id="an_14:12">14:12</span> so man lies down and doesn't rise.
Until the heavens are no more, they shall not awake, nor be roused out
of their sleep.

<span id="an_14:13">14:13</span> "Oh that you would hide me in Sheol,
that you would keep me secret, until your wrath is past, that you would
appoint me a set time, and remember me!

<span id="an_14:14">14:14</span> If a man dies, shall he live again? All
the days of my warfare would I wait, until my release should come.

<span id="an_14:15">14:15</span> You would call, and I would answer you.
You would have a desire to the work of your hands.

<span id="an_14:16">14:16</span> But now you number my steps. Don't you
watch over my sin?

<span id="an_14:17">14:17</span> My disobedience is sealed up in a bag.
You fasten up my iniquity.

<span id="an_14:18">14:18</span> "But the mountain falling comes to
nothing. The rock is removed out of its place;

<span id="an_14:19">14:19</span> The waters wear the stones. The
torrents of it wash away the dust of the earth. So you destroy the hope
of man.

<span id="an_14:20">14:20</span> You forever prevail against him, and he
departs. You change his face, and send him away.

<span id="an_14:21">14:21</span> His sons come to honor, and he doesn't
know it. They are brought low, but he doesn't perceive it of them.

<span id="an_14:22">14:22</span> But his flesh on him has pain, and his
soul within him mourns."

<span id="an_15:1">15:1</span> Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered,

<span id="an_15:2">15:2</span> "Should a wise man answer with vain
knowledge, and fill himself with the east wind?

<span id="an_15:3">15:3</span> Should he reason with unprofitable talk,
or with speeches with which he can do no good?

<span id="an_15:4">15:4</span> Yes, you do away with fear, and hinder
devotion before God.

<span id="an_15:5">15:5</span> For your iniquity teaches your mouth, and
you choose the language of the crafty.

<span id="an_15:6">15:6</span> Your own mouth condemns you, and not I.
Yes, your own lips testify against you.

<span id="an_15:7">15:7</span> "Are you the first man who was born? Or
were you brought forth before the hills?

<span id="an_15:8">15:8</span> Have you heard the secret counsel of God?
Do you limit wisdom to yourself?

<span id="an_15:9">15:9</span> What do you know, that we don't know?
What do you understand, which is not in us?

<span id="an_15:10">15:10</span> With us are both the gray-headed and
the very aged men, much elder than your father.

<span id="an_15:11">15:11</span> Are the consolations of God too small
for you, even the word that is gentle toward you?

<span id="an_15:12">15:12</span> Why does your heart carry you away? Why
do your eyes flash,

<span id="an_15:13">15:13</span> That you turn your spirit against God,
and let such words go out of your mouth?

<span id="an_15:14">15:14</span> What is man, that he should be clean?
What is he who is born of a woman, that he should be righteous?

<span id="an_15:15">15:15</span> Behold, he puts no trust in his holy
ones. Yes, the heavens are not clean in his sight;

<span id="an_15:16">15:16</span> how much less one who is abominable and
corrupt, a man who drinks iniquity like water!

<span id="an_15:17">15:17</span> "I will show you, listen to me; that
which I have seen I will declare:

<span id="an_15:18">15:18</span> (Which wise men have told by their
fathers, and have not hidden it;

<span id="an_15:19">15:19</span> to whom alone the land was given, and
no stranger passed among them):

<span id="an_15:20">15:20</span> the wicked man writhes in pain all his
days, even the number of years that are laid up for the oppressor.

<span id="an_15:21">15:21</span> A sound of terrors is in his ears. In
prosperity the destroyer shall come on him.

<span id="an_15:22">15:22</span> He doesn't believe that he shall return
out of darkness. He is waited for by the sword.

<span id="an_15:23">15:23</span> He wanders abroad for bread, saying,
'Where is it?' He knows that the day of darkness is ready at his hand.

<span id="an_15:24">15:24</span> Distress and anguish make him afraid.
They prevail against him, as a king ready to the battle.

<span id="an_15:25">15:25</span> Because he has stretched out his hand
against God, and behaves himself proudly against the Almighty;

<span id="an_15:26">15:26</span> he runs at him with a stiff neck, with
the thick shields of his bucklers;

<span id="an_15:27">15:27</span> because he has covered his face with
his fatness, and gathered fat on his thighs.

<span id="an_15:28">15:28</span> He has lived in desolate cities, in
houses which no one inhabited, which were ready to become heaps.

<span id="an_15:29">15:29</span> He shall not be rich, neither shall his
substance continue, neither shall their possessions be extended on the
earth.

<span id="an_15:30">15:30</span> He shall not depart out of darkness.
The flame shall dry up his branches. By the breath of God's mouth shall
he go away.

<span id="an_15:31">15:31</span> Let him not trust in emptiness,
deceiving himself; for emptiness shall be his reward.

<span id="an_15:32">15:32</span> It shall be accomplished before his
time. His branch shall not be green.

<span id="an_15:33">15:33</span> He shall shake off his unripe grape as
the vine, and shall cast off his flower as the olive tree.

<span id="an_15:34">15:34</span> For the company of the godless shall be
barren, and fire shall consume the tents of bribery.

<span id="an_15:35">15:35</span> They conceive mischief, and bring forth
iniquity. Their heart prepares deceit."

<span id="an_16:1">16:1</span> Then Job answered,

<span id="an_16:2">16:2</span> "I have heard many such things. You are
all miserable comforters!

<span id="an_16:3">16:3</span> Shall vain words have an end? Or what
provokes you that you answer?

<span id="an_16:4">16:4</span> I also could speak as you do. If your
soul were in my soul's place, I could join words together against you,
and shake my head at you,

<span id="an_16:5">16:5</span> but I would strengthen you with my mouth.
The solace of my lips would relieve you.

<span id="an_16:6">16:6</span> "Though I speak, my grief is not
subsided. Though I forbear, what am I eased?

<span id="an_16:7">16:7</span> But now, God, you have surely worn me
out. You have made desolate all my company.

<span id="an_16:8">16:8</span> You have shriveled me up. This is a
witness against me. My leanness rises up against me. It testifies to my
face.

<span id="an_16:9">16:9</span> He has torn me in his wrath, and
persecuted me. He has gnashed on me with his teeth. My adversary
sharpens his eyes on me.

<span id="an_16:10">16:10</span> They have gaped on me with their mouth.
They have struck me on the cheek reproachfully. They gather themselves
together against me.

<span id="an_16:11">16:11</span> God delivers me to the ungodly, and
casts me into the hands of the wicked.

<span id="an_16:12">16:12</span> I was at ease, and he broke me apart.
Yes, he has taken me by the neck, and dashed me to pieces. He has also
set me up for his target.

<span id="an_16:13">16:13</span> His archers surround me. He splits my
kidneys apart, and does not spare. He pours out my gall on the ground.

<span id="an_16:14">16:14</span> He breaks me with breach on breach. He
runs on me like a giant.

<span id="an_16:15">16:15</span> I have sewed sackcloth on my skin, and
have thrust my horn in the dust.

<span id="an_16:16">16:16</span> My face is red with weeping. Deep
darkness is on my eyelids.

<span id="an_16:17">16:17</span> Although there is no violence in my
hands, and my prayer is pure.

<span id="an_16:18">16:18</span> "Earth, don't cover my blood. Let my
cry have no place to rest.

<span id="an_16:19">16:19</span> Even now, behold, my witness is in
heaven. He who vouches for me is on high.

<span id="an_16:20">16:20</span> My friends scoff at me. My eyes pour
out tears to God,

<span id="an_16:21">16:21</span> that he would maintain the right of a
man with God, of a son of man with his neighbor!

<span id="an_16:22">16:22</span> For when a few years are come, I shall
go the way of no return.

<span id="an_17:1">17:1</span> "My spirit is consumed. My days are
extinct, And the grave is ready for me.

<span id="an_17:2">17:2</span> Surely there are mockers with me. My eye
dwells on their provocation.

<span id="an_17:3">17:3</span> "Now give a pledge, be collateral for me
with yourself. Who is there who will strike hands with me?

<span id="an_17:4">17:4</span> For you have hidden their heart from
understanding, Therefore you shall not exalt them.

<span id="an_17:5">17:5</span> He who denounces his friends for a prey,
Even the eyes of his children shall fail.

<span id="an_17:6">17:6</span> "But he has made me a byword of the
people. They spit in my face.

<span id="an_17:7">17:7</span> My eye also is dim by reason of sorrow.
All my members are as a shadow.

<span id="an_17:8">17:8</span> Upright men shall be astonished at this.
The innocent shall stir up himself against the godless.

<span id="an_17:9">17:9</span> Yet shall the righteous hold on his way.
He who has clean hands shall grow stronger and stronger.

<span id="an_17:10">17:10</span> But as for you all, come on now again;
I shall not find a wise man among you.

<span id="an_17:11">17:11</span> My days are past, my plans are broken
off, as are the thoughts of my heart.

<span id="an_17:12">17:12</span> They change the night into day, saying
'The light is near' in the presence of darkness.

<span id="an_17:13">17:13</span> If I look for Sheol as my house, if I
have spread my couch in the darkness,

<span id="an_17:14">17:14</span> If I have said to corruption, 'You are
my father;' to the worm, 'My mother,' and 'my sister;'

<span id="an_17:15">17:15</span> where then is my hope? as for my hope,
who shall see it?

<span id="an_17:16">17:16</span> Shall it go down with me to the gates
of Sheol, or descend together into the dust?"

<span id="an_18:1">18:1</span> Then Bildad the Shuhite answered,

<span id="an_18:2">18:2</span> "How long will you hunt for words?
Consider, and afterwards we will speak.

<span id="an_18:3">18:3</span> Why are we counted as animals, which have
become unclean in your sight?

<span id="an_18:4">18:4</span> You who tear yourself in your anger,
shall the earth be forsaken for you? Or shall the rock be removed out of
its place?

<span id="an_18:5">18:5</span> "Yes, the light of the wicked shall be
put out, The spark of his fire shall not shine.

<span id="an_18:6">18:6</span> The light shall be dark in his tent. His
lamp above him shall be put out.

<span id="an_18:7">18:7</span> The steps of his strength shall be
shortened. His own counsel shall cast him down.

<span id="an_18:8">18:8</span> For he is cast into a net by his own
feet, and he wanders into its mesh.

<span id="an_18:9">18:9</span> A snare will take him by the heel. A trap
will catch him.

<span id="an_18:10">18:10</span> A noose is hidden for him in the
ground, a trap for him in the way.

<span id="an_18:11">18:11</span> Terrors shall make him afraid on every
side, and shall chase him at his heels.

<span id="an_18:12">18:12</span> His strength shall be famished.
Calamity shall be ready at his side.

<span id="an_18:13">18:13</span> The members of his body shall be
devoured. The firstborn of death shall devour his members.

<span id="an_18:14">18:14</span> He shall be rooted out of his tent
where he trusts. He shall be brought to the king of terrors.

<span id="an_18:15">18:15</span> There shall dwell in his tent that
which is none of his. Sulfur shall be scattered on his habitation.

<span id="an_18:16">18:16</span> His roots shall be dried up beneath.
Above shall his branch be cut off.

<span id="an_18:17">18:17</span> His memory shall perish from the earth.
He shall have no name in the street.

<span id="an_18:18">18:18</span> He shall be driven from light into
darkness, and chased out of the world.

<span id="an_18:19">18:19</span> He shall have neither son nor grandson
among his people, nor any remaining where he lived.

<span id="an_18:20">18:20</span> Those who come after shall be
astonished at his day, as those who went before were frightened.

<span id="an_18:21">18:21</span> Surely such are the dwellings of the
unrighteous. This is the place of him who doesn't know God."

<span id="an_19:1">19:1</span> Then Job answered,

<span id="an_19:2">19:2</span> "How long will you torment me, and crush
me with words?

<span id="an_19:3">19:3</span> You have reproached me ten times. You
aren't ashamed that you attack me.

<span id="an_19:4">19:4</span> If it is true that I have erred, my error
remains with myself.

<span id="an_19:5">19:5</span> If indeed you will magnify yourselves
against me, and plead against me my reproach;

<span id="an_19:6">19:6</span> know now that God has subverted me, and
has surrounded me with his net.

<span id="an_19:7">19:7</span> "Behold, I cry out of wrong, but I am not
heard. I cry for help, but there is no justice.

<span id="an_19:8">19:8</span> He has walled up my way so that I can't
pass, and has set darkness in my paths.

<span id="an_19:9">19:9</span> He has stripped me of my glory, and taken
the crown from my head.

<span id="an_19:10">19:10</span> He has broken me down on every side,
and I am gone. My hope he has plucked up like a tree.

<span id="an_19:11">19:11</span> He has also kindled his wrath against
me. He counts me among his adversaries.

<span id="an_19:12">19:12</span> His troops come on together, build a
siege ramp against me, and encamp around my tent.

<span id="an_19:13">19:13</span> "He has put my brothers far from me. My
acquaintances are wholly estranged from me.

<span id="an_19:14">19:14</span> My relatives have gone away. My
familiar friends have forgotten me.

<span id="an_19:15">19:15</span> Those who dwell in my house, and my
maids, count me for a stranger. I am an alien in their sight.

<span id="an_19:16">19:16</span> I call to my servant, and he gives me
no answer. I beg him with my mouth.

<span id="an_19:17">19:17</span> My breath is offensive to my wife. I am
loathsome to the children of my own mother.

<span id="an_19:18">19:18</span> Even young children despise me. If I
arise, they speak against me.

<span id="an_19:19">19:19</span> All my familiar friends abhor me. They
whom I loved have turned against me.

<span id="an_19:20">19:20</span> My bones stick to my skin and to my
flesh. I have escaped by the skin of my teeth.

<span id="an_19:21">19:21</span> "Have pity on me, have pity on me, you
my friends; for the hand of God has touched me.

<span id="an_19:22">19:22</span> Why do you persecute me as God, and are
not satisfied with my flesh?

<span id="an_19:23">19:23</span> "Oh that my words were now written! Oh
that they were inscribed in a book!

<span id="an_19:24">19:24</span> That with an iron pen and lead they
were engraved in the rock forever!

<span id="an_19:25">19:25</span> But as for me, I know that my Redeemer
lives. In the end, he will stand upon the earth.

<span id="an_19:26">19:26</span> After my skin is destroyed, then in my
flesh shall I see God,

<span id="an_19:27">19:27</span> Whom I, even I, shall see on my side.
My eyes shall see, and not as a stranger. "My heart is consumed within
me.

<span id="an_19:28">19:28</span> If you say, 'How we will persecute
him!' because the root of the matter is found in me,

<span id="an_19:29">19:29</span> be afraid of the sword, for wrath
brings the punishments of the sword, that you may know there is a
judgment."

<span id="an_20:1">20:1</span> Then Zophar the Naamathite answered,

<span id="an_20:2">20:2</span> "Therefore do my thoughts give answer to
me, even by reason of my haste that is in me.

<span id="an_20:3">20:3</span> I have heard the reproof which puts me to
shame. The spirit of my understanding answers me.

<span id="an_20:4">20:4</span> Don't you know this from old time, since
man was placed on earth,

<span id="an_20:5">20:5</span> that the triumphing of the wicked is
short, the joy of the godless but for a moment?

<span id="an_20:6">20:6</span> Though his height mount up to the
heavens, and his head reach to the clouds,

<span id="an_20:7">20:7</span> yet he shall perish forever like his own
dung. Those who have seen him shall say, 'Where is he?'

<span id="an_20:8">20:8</span> He shall fly away as a dream, and shall
not be found. Yes, he shall be chased away like a vision of the night.

<span id="an_20:9">20:9</span> The eye which saw him shall see him no
more, neither shall his place any more see him.

<span id="an_20:10">20:10</span> His children shall seek the favor of
the poor. His hands shall give back his wealth.

<span id="an_20:11">20:11</span> His bones are full of his youth, but
youth shall lie down with him in the dust.

<span id="an_20:12">20:12</span> "Though wickedness is sweet in his
mouth, though he hide it under his tongue,

<span id="an_20:13">20:13</span> though he spare it, and will not let it
go, but keep it still within his mouth;

<span id="an_20:14">20:14</span> yet his food in his bowels is turned.
It is cobra venom within him.

<span id="an_20:15">20:15</span> He has swallowed down riches, and he
shall vomit them up again. God will cast them out of his belly.

<span id="an_20:16">20:16</span> He shall suck cobra venom. The viper's
tongue shall kill him.

<span id="an_20:17">20:17</span> He shall not look at the rivers, the
flowing streams of honey and butter.

<span id="an_20:18">20:18</span> That for which he labored he shall
restore, and shall not swallow it down. According to the substance that
he has gotten, he shall not rejoice.

<span id="an_20:19">20:19</span> For he has oppressed and forsaken the
poor. He has violently taken away a house, and he shall not build it up.

<span id="an_20:20">20:20</span> "Because he knew no quietness within
him, he shall not save anything of that in which he delights.

<span id="an_20:21">20:21</span> There was nothing left that he didn't
devour, therefore his prosperity shall not endure.

<span id="an_20:22">20:22</span> In the fullness of his sufficiency,
distress shall overtake him. The hand of everyone who is in misery shall
come on him.

<span id="an_20:23">20:23</span> When he is about to fill his belly, God
will cast the fierceness of his wrath on him. It will rain on him while
he is eating.

<span id="an_20:24">20:24</span> He shall flee from the iron weapon. The
bronze arrow shall strike him through.

<span id="an_20:25">20:25</span> He draws it forth, and it comes out of
his body. Yes, the glittering point comes out of his liver. Terrors are
on him.

<span id="an_20:26">20:26</span> All darkness is laid up for his
treasures. An unfanned fire shall devour him. It shall consume that
which is left in his tent.

<span id="an_20:27">20:27</span> The heavens shall reveal his iniquity.
The earth shall rise up against him.

<span id="an_20:28">20:28</span> The increase of his house shall depart.
They shall rush away in the day of his wrath.

<span id="an_20:29">20:29</span> This is the portion of a wicked man
from God, the heritage appointed to him by God."

<span id="an_21:1">21:1</span> Then Job answered,

<span id="an_21:2">21:2</span> "Listen diligently to my speech. Let this
be your consolation.

<span id="an_21:3">21:3</span> Allow me, and I also will speak; After I
have spoken, mock on.

<span id="an_21:4">21:4</span> As for me, is my complaint to man? Why
shouldn't I be impatient?

<span id="an_21:5">21:5</span> Look at me, and be astonished. Lay your
hand on your mouth.

<span id="an_21:6">21:6</span> When I remember, I am troubled. Horror
takes hold of my flesh.

<span id="an_21:7">21:7</span> "Why do the wicked live, become old, yes,
and grow mighty in power?

<span id="an_21:8">21:8</span> Their child is established with them in
their sight, their offspring before their eyes.

<span id="an_21:9">21:9</span> Their houses are safe from fear, neither
is the rod of God upon them.

<span id="an_21:10">21:10</span> Their bulls breed without fail. Their
cows calve, and don't miscarry.

<span id="an_21:11">21:11</span> They send forth their little ones like
a flock. Their children dance.

<span id="an_21:12">21:12</span> They sing to the tambourine and harp,
and rejoice at the sound of the pipe.

<span id="an_21:13">21:13</span> They spend their days in prosperity. In
an instant they go down to Sheol.

<span id="an_21:14">21:14</span> They tell God, 'Depart from us, for we
don't want to know about your ways.

<span id="an_21:15">21:15</span> What is the Almighty, that we should
serve him? What profit should we have, if we pray to him?'

<span id="an_21:16">21:16</span> Behold, their prosperity is not in
their hand. The counsel of the wicked is far from me.

<span id="an_21:17">21:17</span> "How often is it that the lamp of the
wicked is put out, that their calamity comes on them, that God
distributes sorrows in his anger?

<span id="an_21:18">21:18</span> How often is it that they are as
stubble before the wind, as chaff that the storm carries away?

<span id="an_21:19">21:19</span> You say, 'God lays up his iniquity for
his children.' Let him recompense it to himself, that he may know it.

<span id="an_21:20">21:20</span> Let his own eyes see his destruction.
Let him drink of the wrath of the Almighty.

<span id="an_21:21">21:21</span> For what does he care for his house
after him, when the number of his months is cut off?

<span id="an_21:22">21:22</span> "Shall any teach God knowledge, since
he judges those who are high?

<span id="an_21:23">21:23</span> One dies in his full strength, being
wholly at ease and quiet.

<span id="an_21:24">21:24</span> His pails are full of milk. The marrow
of his bones is moistened.

<span id="an_21:25">21:25</span> Another dies in bitterness of soul, and
never tastes of good.

<span id="an_21:26">21:26</span> They lie down alike in the dust. The
worm covers them.

<span id="an_21:27">21:27</span> "Behold, I know your thoughts, the
devices with which you would wrong me.

<span id="an_21:28">21:28</span> For you say, 'Where is the house of the
prince? Where is the tent in which the wicked lived?'

<span id="an_21:29">21:29</span> Haven't you asked wayfaring men? Don't
you know their evidences,

<span id="an_21:30">21:30</span> that the evil man is reserved to the
day of calamity, That they are led forth to the day of wrath?

<span id="an_21:31">21:31</span> Who shall declare his way to his face?
Who shall repay him what he has done?

<span id="an_21:32">21:32</span> Yet he will be borne to the grave. Men
shall keep watch over the tomb.

<span id="an_21:33">21:33</span> The clods of the valley shall be sweet
to him. All men shall draw after him, as there were innumerable before
him.

<span id="an_21:34">21:34</span> So how can you comfort me with
nonsense, because in your answers there remains only falsehood?"

<span id="an_22:1">22:1</span> Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered,

<span id="an_22:2">22:2</span> "Can a man be profitable to God? Surely
he who is wise is profitable to himself.

<span id="an_22:3">22:3</span> Is it any pleasure to the Almighty, that
you are righteous? Or does it benefit him, that you make your ways
perfect?

<span id="an_22:4">22:4</span> Is it for your piety that he reproves
you, that he enters with you into judgment?

<span id="an_22:5">22:5</span> Isn't your wickedness great? Neither is
there any end to your iniquities.

<span id="an_22:6">22:6</span> For you have taken pledges from your
brother for nothing, and stripped the naked of their clothing.

<span id="an_22:7">22:7</span> You haven't given water to the weary to
drink, and you have withheld bread from the hungry.

<span id="an_22:8">22:8</span> But as for the mighty man, he had the
earth. The honorable man, he lived in it.

<span id="an_22:9">22:9</span> You have sent widows away empty, and the
arms of the fatherless have been broken.

<span id="an_22:10">22:10</span> Therefore snares are around you. Sudden
fear troubles you,

<span id="an_22:11">22:11</span> or darkness, so that you can not see,
and floods of waters cover you.

<span id="an_22:12">22:12</span> "Isn't God in the heights of heaven?
See the height of the stars, how high they are!

<span id="an_22:13">22:13</span> You say, 'What does God know? Can he
judge through the thick darkness?

<span id="an_22:14">22:14</span> Thick clouds are a covering to him, so
that he doesn't see. He walks on the vault of the sky.'

<span id="an_22:15">22:15</span> Will you keep the old way, which wicked
men have trodden,

<span id="an_22:16">22:16</span> who were snatched away before their
time, whose foundation was poured out as a stream,

<span id="an_22:17">22:17</span> who said to God, 'Depart from us;' and,
'What can the Almighty do for us?'

<span id="an_22:18">22:18</span> Yet he filled their houses with good
things, but the counsel of the wicked is far from me.

<span id="an_22:19">22:19</span> The righteous see it, and are glad. The
innocent ridicule them,

<span id="an_22:20">22:20</span> saying, 'Surely those who rose up
against us are cut off. The fire has consumed the remnant of them.'

<span id="an_22:21">22:21</span> "Acquaint yourself with him, now, and
be at peace. Thereby good shall come to you.

<span id="an_22:22">22:22</span> Please receive instruction from his
mouth, and lay up his words in your heart.

<span id="an_22:23">22:23</span> If you return to the Almighty, you
shall be built up, if you put away unrighteousness far from your tents.

<span id="an_22:24">22:24</span> Lay your treasure in the dust, the gold
of Ophir among the stones of the brooks.

<span id="an_22:25">22:25</span> The Almighty will be your treasure, and
precious silver to you.

<span id="an_22:26">22:26</span> For then you will delight yourself in
the Almighty, and shall lift up your face to God.

<span id="an_22:27">22:27</span> You shall make your prayer to him, and
he will hear you. You shall pay your vows.

<span id="an_22:28">22:28</span> You shall also decree a thing, and it
shall be established to you. Light shall shine on your ways.

<span id="an_22:29">22:29</span> When they cast down, you shall say, 'be
lifted up.' He will save the humble person.

<span id="an_22:30">22:30</span> He will even deliver him who is not
innocent. Yes, he shall be delivered through the cleanness of your
hands."

<span id="an_23:1">23:1</span> Then Job answered,

<span id="an_23:2">23:2</span> "Even today my complaint is rebellious.
His hand is heavy in spite of my groaning.

<span id="an_23:3">23:3</span> Oh that I knew where I might find him!
That I might come even to his seat!

<span id="an_23:4">23:4</span> I would set my cause in order before him,
and fill my mouth with arguments.

<span id="an_23:5">23:5</span> I would know the words which he would
answer me, and understand what he would tell me.

<span id="an_23:6">23:6</span> Would he contend with me in the greatness
of his power? No, but he would listen to me.

<span id="an_23:7">23:7</span> There the upright might reason with him,
so I should be delivered forever from my judge.

<span id="an_23:8">23:8</span> "If I go east, he is not there; if west,
I can't find him;

<span id="an_23:9">23:9</span> He works to the north, but I can't see
him. He turns south, but I can't catch a glimpse of him.

<span id="an_23:10">23:10</span> But he knows the way that I take. When
he has tried me, I shall come forth like gold.

<span id="an_23:11">23:11</span> My foot has held fast to his steps. I
have kept his way, and not turned aside.

<span id="an_23:12">23:12</span> I haven't gone back from the
commandment of his lips. I have treasured up the words of his mouth more
than my necessary food.

<span id="an_23:13">23:13</span> But he stands alone, and who can oppose
him? What his soul desires, even that he does.

<span id="an_23:14">23:14</span> For he performs that which is appointed
for me. Many such things are with him.

<span id="an_23:15">23:15</span> Therefore I am terrified at his
presence. When I consider, I am afraid of him.

<span id="an_23:16">23:16</span> For God has made my heart faint. The
Almighty has terrified me.

<span id="an_23:17">23:17</span> Because I was not cut off before the
darkness, neither did he cover the thick darkness from my face.

<span id="an_24:1">24:1</span> "Why aren't times laid up by the
Almighty? Why don't those who know him see his days?

<span id="an_24:2">24:2</span> There are people who remove the
landmarks. They violently take away flocks, and feed them.

<span id="an_24:3">24:3</span> They drive away the donkey of the
fatherless, and they take the widow's ox for a pledge.

<span id="an_24:4">24:4</span> They turn the needy out of the way. The
poor of the earth all hide themselves.

<span id="an_24:5">24:5</span> Behold, as wild donkeys in the desert,
they go forth to their work, seeking diligently for food. The wilderness
yields them bread for their children.

<span id="an_24:6">24:6</span> They cut their provender in the field.
They glean the vineyard of the wicked.

<span id="an_24:7">24:7</span> They lie all night naked without
clothing, and have no covering in the cold.

<span id="an_24:8">24:8</span> They are wet with the showers of the
mountains, and embrace the rock for lack of a shelter.

<span id="an_24:9">24:9</span> There are those who pluck the fatherless
from the breast, and take a pledge of the poor,

<span id="an_24:10">24:10</span> So that they go around naked without
clothing. Being hungry, they carry the sheaves.

<span id="an_24:11">24:11</span> They make oil within the walls of these
men. They tread wine presses, and suffer thirst.

<span id="an_24:12">24:12</span> From out of the populous city, men
groan. The soul of the wounded cries out, yet God doesn't regard the
folly.

<span id="an_24:13">24:13</span> "These are of those who rebel against
the light. They don't know its ways, nor stay in its paths.

<span id="an_24:14">24:14</span> The murderer rises with the light. He
kills the poor and needy. In the night he is like a thief.

<span id="an_24:15">24:15</span> The eye also of the adulterer waits for
the twilight, saying, 'No eye shall see me.' He disguises his face.

<span id="an_24:16">24:16</span> In the dark they dig through houses.
They shut themselves up in the daytime. They don't know the light.

<span id="an_24:17">24:17</span> For the morning is to all of them like
thick darkness, for they know the terrors of the thick darkness.

<span id="an_24:18">24:18</span> "They are foam on the surface of the
waters. Their portion is cursed in the earth. They don't turn into the
way of the vineyards.

<span id="an_24:19">24:19</span> Drought and heat consume the snow
waters, so does Sheol those who have sinned.

<span id="an_24:20">24:20</span> The womb shall forget him. The worm
shall feed sweetly on him. He shall be no more remembered.
Unrighteousness shall be broken as a tree.

<span id="an_24:21">24:21</span> He devours the barren who don't bear.
He shows no kindness to the widow.

<span id="an_24:22">24:22</span> Yet God preserves the mighty by his
power. He rises up who has no assurance of life.

<span id="an_24:23">24:23</span> God gives them security, and they rest
in it. His eyes are on their ways.

<span id="an_24:24">24:24</span> They are exalted; yet a little while,
and they are gone. Yes, they are brought low, they are taken out of the
way as all others, and are cut off as the tops of the ears of grain.

<span id="an_24:25">24:25</span> If it isn't so now, who will prove me a
liar, and make my speech worth nothing?"

<span id="an_25:1">25:1</span> Then Bildad the Shuhite answered,

<span id="an_25:2">25:2</span> "Dominion and fear are with him. He makes
peace in his high places.

<span id="an_25:3">25:3</span> Can his armies be counted? On whom does
his light not arise?

<span id="an_25:4">25:4</span> How then can man be just with God? Or how
can he who is born of a woman be clean?

<span id="an_25:5">25:5</span> Behold, even the moon has no brightness,
and the stars are not pure in his sight;

<span id="an_25:6">25:6</span> How much less man, who is a worm, the son
of man, who is a worm!"

<span id="an_26:1">26:1</span> Then Job answered,

<span id="an_26:2">26:2</span> "How have you helped him who is without
power! How have you saved the arm that has no strength!

<span id="an_26:3">26:3</span> How have you counseled him who has no
wisdom, and plentifully declared sound knowledge!

<span id="an_26:4">26:4</span> To whom have you uttered words? Whose
spirit came forth from you?

<span id="an_26:5">26:5</span> "Those who are deceased tremble, those
beneath the waters and all that live in them.

<span id="an_26:6">26:6</span> Sheol is naked before God, and Abaddon
has no covering.

<span id="an_26:7">26:7</span> He stretches out the north over empty
space, and hangs the earth on nothing.

<span id="an_26:8">26:8</span> He binds up the waters in his thick
clouds, and the cloud is not burst under them.

<span id="an_26:9">26:9</span> He encloses the face of his throne, and
spreads his cloud on it.

<span id="an_26:10">26:10</span> He has described a boundary on the
surface of the waters, and to the confines of light and darkness.

<span id="an_26:11">26:11</span> The pillars of heaven tremble and are
astonished at his rebuke.

<span id="an_26:12">26:12</span> He stirs up the sea with his power, and
by his understanding he strikes through Rahab.

<span id="an_26:13">26:13</span> By his Spirit the heavens are
garnished. His hand has pierced the swift serpent.

<span id="an_26:14">26:14</span> Behold, these are but the outskirts of
his ways. How small a whisper do we hear of him! But the thunder of his
power who can understand?"

<span id="an_27:1">27:1</span> Job again took up his parable, and said,

<span id="an_27:2">27:2</span> "As God lives, who has taken away my
right, the Almighty, who has made my soul bitter.

<span id="an_27:3">27:3</span> (For the length of my life is still in
me, and the spirit of God is in my nostrils);

<span id="an_27:4">27:4</span> surely my lips shall not speak
unrighteousness, neither shall my tongue utter deceit.

<span id="an_27:5">27:5</span> Far be it from me that I should justify
you. Until I die I will not put away my integrity from me.

<span id="an_27:6">27:6</span> I hold fast to my righteousness, and will
not let it go. My heart shall not reproach me so long as I live.

<span id="an_27:7">27:7</span> "Let my enemy be as the wicked. Let him
who rises up against me be as the unrighteous.

<span id="an_27:8">27:8</span> For what is the hope of the godless, when
he is cut off, when God takes away his life?

<span id="an_27:9">27:9</span> Will God hear his cry when trouble comes
on him?

<span id="an_27:10">27:10</span> Will he delight himself in the
Almighty, and call on God at all times?

<span id="an_27:11">27:11</span> I will teach you about the hand of God.
That which is with the Almighty will I not conceal.

<span id="an_27:12">27:12</span> Behold, all of you have seen it
yourselves; why then have you become altogether vain?

<span id="an_27:13">27:13</span> "This is the portion of a wicked man
with God, the heritage of oppressors, which they receive from the
Almighty.

<span id="an_27:14">27:14</span> If his children are multiplied, it is
for the sword. His offspring shall not be satisfied with bread.

<span id="an_27:15">27:15</span> Those who remain of him shall be buried
in death. His widows shall make no lamentation.

<span id="an_27:16">27:16</span> Though he heap up silver as the dust,
and prepare clothing as the clay;

<span id="an_27:17">27:17</span> he may prepare it, but the just shall
put it on, and the innocent shall divide the silver.

<span id="an_27:18">27:18</span> He builds his house as the moth, as a
booth which the watchman makes.

<span id="an_27:19">27:19</span> He lies down rich, but he shall not do
so again. He opens his eyes, and he is not.

<span id="an_27:20">27:20</span> Terrors overtake him like waters. A
storm steals him away in the night.

<span id="an_27:21">27:21</span> The east wind carries him away, and he
departs. It sweeps him out of his place.

<span id="an_27:22">27:22</span> For it hurls at him, and does not
spare, as he flees away from his hand.

<span id="an_27:23">27:23</span> Men shall clap their hands at him, and
shall hiss him out of his place.

<span id="an_28:1">28:1</span> "Surely there is a mine for silver, and a
place for gold which they refine.

<span id="an_28:2">28:2</span> Iron is taken out of the earth, and
copper is smelted out of the ore.

<span id="an_28:3">28:3</span> Man sets an end to darkness, and searches
out, to the furthest bound, the stones of obscurity and of thick
darkness.

<span id="an_28:4">28:4</span> He breaks open a shaft away from where
people live. They are forgotten by the foot. They hang far from men,
they swing back and forth.

<span id="an_28:5">28:5</span> As for the earth, out of it comes bread;
Underneath it is turned up as it were by fire.

<span id="an_28:6">28:6</span> Sapphires come from its rocks. It has
dust of gold.

<span id="an_28:7">28:7</span> That path no bird of prey knows, neither
has the falcon's eye seen it.

<span id="an_28:8">28:8</span> The proud animals have not trodden it,
nor has the fierce lion passed by there.

<span id="an_28:9">28:9</span> He puts forth his hand on the flinty
rock, and he overturns the mountains by the roots.

<span id="an_28:10">28:10</span> He cuts out channels among the rocks.
His eye sees every precious thing.

<span id="an_28:11">28:11</span> He binds the streams that they don't
trickle. The thing that is hidden he brings forth to light.

<span id="an_28:12">28:12</span> "But where shall wisdom be found? Where
is the place of understanding?

<span id="an_28:13">28:13</span> Man doesn't know its price; Neither is
it found in the land of the living.

<span id="an_28:14">28:14</span> The deep says, 'It isn't in me.' The
sea says, 'It isn't with me.'

<span id="an_28:15">28:15</span> It can't be gotten for gold, neither
shall silver be weighed for its price.

<span id="an_28:16">28:16</span> It can't be valued with the gold of
Ophir, with the precious onyx, or the sapphire.

<span id="an_28:17">28:17</span> Gold and glass can't equal it, neither
shall it be exchanged for jewels of fine gold.

<span id="an_28:18">28:18</span> No mention shall be made of coral or of
crystal. Yes, the price of wisdom is above rubies.

<span id="an_28:19">28:19</span> The topaz of Ethiopia shall not equal
it, Neither shall it be valued with pure gold.

<span id="an_28:20">28:20</span> Where then does wisdom come from? Where
is the place of understanding?

<span id="an_28:21">28:21</span> Seeing it is hidden from the eyes of
all living, and kept close from the birds of the sky.

<span id="an_28:22">28:22</span> Destruction and Death say, 'We have
heard a rumor of it with our ears.'

<span id="an_28:23">28:23</span> "God understands its way, and he knows
its place.

<span id="an_28:24">28:24</span> For he looks to the ends of the earth,
and sees under the whole sky.

<span id="an_28:25">28:25</span> He establishes the force of the wind.
Yes, he measures out the waters by measure.

<span id="an_28:26">28:26</span> When he made a decree for the rain, and
a way for the lightning of the thunder;

<span id="an_28:27">28:27</span> then he saw it, and declared it. He
established it, yes, and searched it out.

<span id="an_28:28">28:28</span> To man he said, 'Behold, the fear of
the Lord, that is wisdom. To depart from evil is understanding.'"

<span id="an_29:1">29:1</span> Job again took up his parable, and said,

<span id="an_29:2">29:2</span> "Oh that I were as in the months of old,
as in the days when God watched over me;

<span id="an_29:3">29:3</span> when his lamp shone on my head, and by
his light I walked through darkness,

<span id="an_29:4">29:4</span> as I was in the ripeness of my days, when
the friendship of God was in my tent,

<span id="an_29:5">29:5</span> when the Almighty was yet with me, and my
children were around me,

<span id="an_29:6">29:6</span> when my steps were washed with butter,
and the rock poured out streams of oil for me,

<span id="an_29:7">29:7</span> when I went forth to the city gate, when
I prepared my seat in the street.

<span id="an_29:8">29:8</span> The young men saw me and hid themselves.
The aged rose up and stood.

<span id="an_29:9">29:9</span> The princes refrained from talking, and
laid their hand on their mouth.

<span id="an_29:10">29:10</span> The voice of the nobles was hushed, and
their tongue stuck to the roof of their mouth.

<span id="an_29:11">29:11</span> For when the ear heard me, then it
blessed me; and when the eye saw me, it commended me:

<span id="an_29:12">29:12</span> Because I delivered the poor who cried,
and the fatherless also, who had none to help him,

<span id="an_29:13">29:13</span> the blessing of him who was ready to
perish came on me, and I caused the widow's heart to sing for joy.

<span id="an_29:14">29:14</span> I put on righteousness, and it clothed
me. My justice was as a robe and a diadem.

<span id="an_29:15">29:15</span> I was eyes to the blind, and feet to
the lame.

<span id="an_29:16">29:16</span> I was a father to the needy. The cause
of him who I didn't know, I searched out.

<span id="an_29:17">29:17</span> I broke the jaws of the unrighteous,
and plucked the prey out of his teeth.

<span id="an_29:18">29:18</span> Then I said, 'I shall die in my own
house, I shall number my days as the sand.

<span id="an_29:19">29:19</span> My root is spread out to the waters.
The dew lies all night on my branch.

<span id="an_29:20">29:20</span> My glory is fresh in me. My bow is
renewed in my hand.'

<span id="an_29:21">29:21</span> "Men listened to me, waited, and kept
silence for my counsel.

<span id="an_29:22">29:22</span> After my words they didn't speak again.
My speech fell on them.

<span id="an_29:23">29:23</span> They waited for me as for the rain.
Their mouths drank as with the spring rain.

<span id="an_29:24">29:24</span> I smiled on them when they had no
confidence. They didn't reject the light of my face.

<span id="an_29:25">29:25</span> I chose out their way, and sat as
chief. I lived as a king in the army, as one who comforts the mourners.

<span id="an_30:1">30:1</span> "But now those who are younger than I
have me in derision, whose fathers I would have disdained to put with my
sheep dogs.

<span id="an_30:2">30:2</span> Of what use is the strength of their
hands to me, men in whom ripe age has perished?

<span id="an_30:3">30:3</span> They are gaunt from lack and famine. They
gnaw the dry ground, in the gloom of waste and desolation.

<span id="an_30:4">30:4</span> They pluck salt herbs by the bushes. The
roots of the broom are their food.

<span id="an_30:5">30:5</span> They are driven out from the midst of
men. They cry after them as after a thief;

<span id="an_30:6">30:6</span> So that they dwell in frightful valleys,
and in holes of the earth and of the rocks.

<span id="an_30:7">30:7</span> Among the bushes they bray; and under the
nettles they are gathered together.

<span id="an_30:8">30:8</span> They are children of fools, yes, children
of base men. They were flogged out of the land.

<span id="an_30:9">30:9</span> "Now I have become their song. Yes, I am
a byword to them.

<span id="an_30:10">30:10</span> They abhor me, they stand aloof from
me, and don't hesitate to spit in my face.

<span id="an_30:11">30:11</span> For he has untied his cord, and
afflicted me; and they have thrown off restraint before me.

<span id="an_30:12">30:12</span> On my right hand rise the rabble. They
thrust aside my feet, They cast up against me their ways of destruction.

<span id="an_30:13">30:13</span> They mar my path, They set forward my
calamity, without anyone's help.

<span id="an_30:14">30:14</span> As through a wide breach they come, in
the midst of the ruin they roll themselves in.

<span id="an_30:15">30:15</span> Terrors have turned on me. They chase
my honor as the wind. My welfare has passed away as a cloud.

<span id="an_30:16">30:16</span> "Now my soul is poured out within me.
Days of affliction have taken hold on me.

<span id="an_30:17">30:17</span> In the night season my bones are
pierced in me, and the pains that gnaw me take no rest.

<span id="an_30:18">30:18</span> By great force is my garment
disfigured. It binds me about as the collar of my coat.

<span id="an_30:19">30:19</span> He has cast me into the mire. I have
become like dust and ashes.

<span id="an_30:20">30:20</span> I cry to you, and you do not answer me.
I stand up, and you gaze at me.

<span id="an_30:21">30:21</span> You have turned to be cruel to me. With
the might of your hand you persecute me.

<span id="an_30:22">30:22</span> You lift me up to the wind, and drive
me with it. You dissolve me in the storm.

<span id="an_30:23">30:23</span> For I know that you will bring me to
death, To the house appointed for all living.

<span id="an_30:24">30:24</span> "However doesn't one stretch out a hand
in his fall? Or in his calamity therefore cry for help?

<span id="an_30:25">30:25</span> Didn't I weep for him who was in
trouble? Wasn't my soul grieved for the needy?

<span id="an_30:26">30:26</span> When I looked for good, then evil came;
When I waited for light, there came darkness.

<span id="an_30:27">30:27</span> My heart is troubled, and doesn't rest.
Days of affliction have come on me.

<span id="an_30:28">30:28</span> I go mourning without the sun. I stand
up in the assembly, and cry for help.

<span id="an_30:29">30:29</span> I am a brother to jackals, and a
companion to ostriches.

<span id="an_30:30">30:30</span> My skin grows black and peels from me.
My bones are burned with heat.

<span id="an_30:31">30:31</span> Therefore my harp has turned to
mourning, and my pipe into the voice of those who weep.

<span id="an_31:1">31:1</span> "I made a covenant with my eyes, how then
should I look lustfully at a young woman?

<span id="an_31:2">31:2</span> For what is the portion from God above,
and the heritage from the Almighty on high?

<span id="an_31:3">31:3</span> Is it not calamity to the unrighteous,
and disaster to the workers of iniquity?

<span id="an_31:4">31:4</span> Doesn't he see my ways, and number all my
steps?

<span id="an_31:5">31:5</span> "If I have walked with falsehood, and my
foot has hurried to deceit

<span id="an_31:6">31:6</span> (let me be weighed in an even balance,
that God may know my integrity);

<span id="an_31:7">31:7</span> if my step has turned out of the way, if
my heart walked after my eyes, if any defilement has stuck to my hands,

<span id="an_31:8">31:8</span> then let me sow, and let another eat.
Yes, let the produce of my field be rooted out.

<span id="an_31:9">31:9</span> "If my heart has been enticed to a woman,
and I have laid wait at my neighbor's door,

<span id="an_31:10">31:10</span> then let my wife grind for another, and
let others sleep with her.

<span id="an_31:11">31:11</span> For that would be a heinous crime. Yes,
it would be an iniquity to be punished by the judges:

<span id="an_31:12">31:12</span> For it is a fire that consumes to
destruction, and would root out all my increase.

<span id="an_31:13">31:13</span> "If I have despised the cause of my
male servant or of my female servant, when they contended with me;

<span id="an_31:14">31:14</span> What then shall I do when God rises up?
When he visits, what shall I answer him?

<span id="an_31:15">31:15</span> Didn't he who made me in the womb make
him? Didn't one fashion us in the womb?

<span id="an_31:16">31:16</span> "If I have withheld the poor from their
desire, or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail,

<span id="an_31:17">31:17</span> or have eaten my morsel alone, and the
fatherless has not eaten of it

<span id="an_31:18">31:18</span> (no, from my youth he grew up with me
as with a father, her have I guided from my mother's womb);

<span id="an_31:19">31:19</span> if I have seen any perish for want of
clothing, or that the needy had no covering;

<span id="an_31:20">31:20</span> if his heart hasn't blessed me, if he
hasn't been warmed with my sheep's fleece;

<span id="an_31:21">31:21</span> if I have lifted up my hand against the
fatherless, because I saw my help in the gate,

<span id="an_31:22">31:22</span> then let my shoulder fall from the
shoulder blade, and my arm be broken from the bone.

<span id="an_31:23">31:23</span> For calamity from God is a terror to
me. Because his majesty, I can do nothing.

<span id="an_31:24">31:24</span> "If I have made gold my hope, and have
said to the fine gold, 'You are my confidence;'

<span id="an_31:25">31:25</span> If I have rejoiced because my wealth
was great, and because my hand had gotten much;

<span id="an_31:26">31:26</span> if I have seen the sun when it shined,
or the moon moving in splendor,

<span id="an_31:27">31:27</span> and my heart has been secretly enticed,
and my hand threw a kiss from my mouth,

<span id="an_31:28">31:28</span> this also would be an iniquity to be
punished by the judges; for I should have denied the God who is above.

<span id="an_31:29">31:29</span> "If I have rejoiced at the destruction
of him who hated me, or lifted up myself when evil found him;

<span id="an_31:30">31:30</span> (yes, I have not allowed my mouth to
sin by asking his life with a curse);

<span id="an_31:31">31:31</span> if the men of my tent have not said,
'Who can find one who has not been filled with his meat?'

<span id="an_31:32">31:32</span> (the foreigner has not lodged in the
street, but I have opened my doors to the traveler);

<span id="an_31:33">31:33</span> if like Adam I have covered my
transgressions, by hiding my iniquity in my heart,

<span id="an_31:34">31:34</span> because I feared the great multitude,
and the contempt of families terrified me, so that I kept silence, and
didn't go out of the door--

<span id="an_31:35">31:35</span> oh that I had one to hear me! (behold,
here is my signature, let the Almighty answer me); let the accuser write
my indictment!

<span id="an_31:36">31:36</span> Surely I would carry it on my shoulder;
and I would bind it to me as a crown.

<span id="an_31:37">31:37</span> I would declare to him the number of my
steps. as a prince would I go near to him.

<span id="an_31:38">31:38</span> If my land cries out against me, and
its furrows weep together;

<span id="an_31:39">31:39</span> if I have eaten its fruits without
money, or have caused its owners to lose their life,

<span id="an_31:40">31:40</span> let briars grow instead of wheat, and
stinkweed instead of barley." The words of Job are ended.

<span id="an_32:1">32:1</span> So these three men ceased to answer Job,
because he was righteous in his own eyes.

<span id="an_32:2">32:2</span> Then the wrath of Elihu the son of
Barachel, the Buzite, of the family of Ram, was kindled against Job. His
wrath was kindled because he justified himself rather than God.

<span id="an_32:3">32:3</span> Also his wrath was kindled against his
three friends, because they had found no answer, and yet had condemned
Job.

<span id="an_32:4">32:4</span> Now Elihu had waited to speak to Job,
because they were elder than he.

<span id="an_32:5">32:5</span> When Elihu saw that there was no answer
in the mouth of these three men, his wrath was kindled.

<span id="an_32:6">32:6</span> Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite
answered, "I am young, and you are very old; Therefore I held back, and
didn't dare show you my opinion.

<span id="an_32:7">32:7</span> I said, 'Days should speak, and multitude
of years should teach wisdom.'

<span id="an_32:8">32:8</span> But there is a spirit in man, and the
breath of the Almighty gives them understanding.

<span id="an_32:9">32:9</span> It is not the great who are wise, nor the
aged who understand justice.

<span id="an_32:10">32:10</span> Therefore I said, 'Listen to me; I also
will show my opinion.'

<span id="an_32:11">32:11</span> "Behold, I waited for your words, and I
listened for your reasoning, while you searched out what to say.

<span id="an_32:12">32:12</span> Yes, I gave you my full attention, but
there was no one who convinced Job, or who answered his words, among
you.

<span id="an_32:13">32:13</span> Beware lest you say, 'We have found
wisdom, God may refute him, not man;'

<span id="an_32:14">32:14</span> for he has not directed his words
against me; neither will I answer him with your speeches.

<span id="an_32:15">32:15</span> "They are amazed. They answer no more.
They don't have a word to say.

<span id="an_32:16">32:16</span> Shall I wait, because they don't speak,
because they stand still, and answer no more?

<span id="an_32:17">32:17</span> I also will answer my part, and I also
will show my opinion.

<span id="an_32:18">32:18</span> For I am full of words. The spirit
within me constrains me.

<span id="an_32:19">32:19</span> Behold, my breast is as wine which has
no vent; like new wineskins it is ready to burst.

<span id="an_32:20">32:20</span> I will speak, that I may be refreshed.
I will open my lips and answer.

<span id="an_32:21">32:21</span> Please don't let me respect any man's
person, neither will I give flattering titles to any man.

<span id="an_32:22">32:22</span> For I don't know how to give flattering
titles; or else my Maker would soon take me away.

<span id="an_33:1">33:1</span> "However, Job, please hear my speech, and
listen to all my words.

<span id="an_33:2">33:2</span> See now, I have opened my mouth. My
tongue has spoken in my mouth.

<span id="an_33:3">33:3</span> My words shall utter the uprightness of
my heart. That which my lips know they shall speak sincerely.

<span id="an_33:4">33:4</span> The Spirit of God has made me, and the
breath of the Almighty gives me life.

<span id="an_33:5">33:5</span> If you can, answer me. Set your words in
order before me, and stand forth.

<span id="an_33:6">33:6</span> Behold, I am toward God even as you are.
I am also formed out of the clay.

<span id="an_33:7">33:7</span> Behold, my terror shall not make you
afraid, neither shall my pressure be heavy on you.

<span id="an_33:8">33:8</span> "Surely you have spoken in my hearing, I
have heard the voice of your words, saying,

<span id="an_33:9">33:9</span> 'I am clean, without disobedience. I am
innocent, neither is there iniquity in me.

<span id="an_33:10">33:10</span> Behold, he finds occasions against me.
He counts me for his enemy.

<span id="an_33:11">33:11</span> He puts my feet in the stocks. He marks
all my paths.'

<span id="an_33:12">33:12</span> "Behold, I will answer you. In this you
are not just, for God is greater than man.

<span id="an_33:13">33:13</span> Why do you strive against him, because
he doesn't give account of any of his matters?

<span id="an_33:14">33:14</span> For God speaks once, yes twice, though
man pays no attention.

<span id="an_33:15">33:15</span> In a dream, in a vision of the night,
when deep sleep falls on men, in slumbering on the bed;

<span id="an_33:16">33:16</span> Then he opens the ears of men, and
seals their instruction,

<span id="an_33:17">33:17</span> That he may withdraw man from his
purpose, and hide pride from man.

<span id="an_33:18">33:18</span> He keeps back his soul from the pit,
and his life from perishing by the sword.

<span id="an_33:19">33:19</span> He is chastened also with pain on his
bed, with continual strife in his bones;

<span id="an_33:20">33:20</span> So that his life abhors bread, and his
soul dainty food.

<span id="an_33:21">33:21</span> His flesh is so consumed away, that it
can't be seen. His bones that were not seen stick out.

<span id="an_33:22">33:22</span> Yes, his soul draws near to the pit,
and his life to the destroyers.

<span id="an_33:23">33:23</span> "If there is beside him an angel, an
interpreter, one among a thousand, to show to man what is right for him;

<span id="an_33:24">33:24</span> then God is gracious to him, and says,
'Deliver him from going down to the pit, I have found a ransom.'

<span id="an_33:25">33:25</span> His flesh shall be fresher than a
child's. He returns to the days of his youth.

<span id="an_33:26">33:26</span> He prays to God, and he is favorable to
him, so that he sees his face with joy. He restores to man his
righteousness.

<span id="an_33:27">33:27</span> He sings before men, and says, 'I have
sinned, and perverted that which was right, and it didn't profit me.

<span id="an_33:28">33:28</span> He has redeemed my soul from going into
the pit. My life shall see the light.'

<span id="an_33:29">33:29</span> "Behold, God works all these things,
twice, yes three times, with a man,

<span id="an_33:30">33:30</span> to bring back his soul from the pit,
that he may be enlightened with the light of the living.

<span id="an_33:31">33:31</span> Mark well, Job, and listen to me. Hold
your peace, and I will speak.

<span id="an_33:32">33:32</span> If you have anything to say, answer me.
Speak, for I desire to justify you.

<span id="an_33:33">33:33</span> If not, listen to me. Hold your peace,
and I will teach you wisdom."

<span id="an_34:1">34:1</span> Moreover Elihu answered,

<span id="an_34:2">34:2</span> "Hear my words, you wise men. Give ear to
me, you who have knowledge.

<span id="an_34:3">34:3</span> For the ear tries words, as the palate
tastes food.

<span id="an_34:4">34:4</span> Let us choose for us that which is right.
Let us know among ourselves what is good.

<span id="an_34:5">34:5</span> For Job has said, 'I am righteous, God
has taken away my right:

<span id="an_34:6">34:6</span> Notwithstanding my right I am considered
a liar. My wound is incurable, though I am without disobedience.'

<span id="an_34:7">34:7</span> What man is like Job, who drinks scorn
like water,

<span id="an_34:8">34:8</span> Who goes in company with the workers of
iniquity, and walks with wicked men?

<span id="an_34:9">34:9</span> For he has said, 'It profits a man
nothing that he should delight himself with God.'

<span id="an_34:10">34:10</span> "Therefore listen to me, you men of
understanding: far be it from God, that he should do wickedness, from
the Almighty, that he should commit iniquity.

<span id="an_34:11">34:11</span> For the work of a man he will render to
him, and cause every man to find according to his ways.

<span id="an_34:12">34:12</span> Yes surely, God will not do wickedly,
neither will the Almighty pervert justice.

<span id="an_34:13">34:13</span> Who put him in charge of the earth? or
who has appointed him over the whole world?

<span id="an_34:14">34:14</span> If he set his heart on himself, If he
gathered to himself his spirit and his breath,

<span id="an_34:15">34:15</span> all flesh would perish together, and
man would turn again to dust.

<span id="an_34:16">34:16</span> "If now you have understanding, hear
this. Listen to the voice of my words.

<span id="an_34:17">34:17</span> Shall even one who hates justice
govern? Will you condemn him who is righteous and mighty?--

<span id="an_34:18">34:18</span> Who says to a king, 'Vile!' or to
nobles, 'Wicked!'?

<span id="an_34:19">34:19</span> Who doesn't respect the persons of
princes, nor respects the rich more than the poor; for they all are the
work of his hands.

<span id="an_34:20">34:20</span> In a moment they die, even at midnight.
The people are shaken and pass away. The mighty are taken away without a
hand.

<span id="an_34:21">34:21</span> "For his eyes are on the ways of a man.
He sees all his goings.

<span id="an_34:22">34:22</span> There is no darkness, nor thick gloom,
where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves.

<span id="an_34:23">34:23</span> For he doesn't need to consider a man
further, that he should go before God in judgment.

<span id="an_34:24">34:24</span> He breaks in pieces mighty men in ways
past finding out, and sets others in their place.

<span id="an_34:25">34:25</span> Therefore he takes knowledge of their
works. He overturns them in the night, so that they are destroyed.

<span id="an_34:26">34:26</span> He strikes them as wicked men in the
open sight of others;

<span id="an_34:27">34:27</span> because they turned aside from
following him, and wouldn't pay attention to any of his ways,

<span id="an_34:28">34:28</span> so that they caused the cry of the poor
to come to him. He heard the cry of the afflicted.

<span id="an_34:29">34:29</span> When he gives quietness, who then can
condemn? When he hides his face, who then can see him? Alike whether to
a nation, or to a man,

<span id="an_34:30">34:30</span> that the godless man may not reign,
that there be no one to ensnare the people.

<span id="an_34:31">34:31</span> "For has any said to God, 'I am guilty,
but I will not offend any more.

<span id="an_34:32">34:32</span> Teach me that which I don't see. If I
have done iniquity, I will do it no more'?

<span id="an_34:33">34:33</span> Shall his recompense be as you desire,
that you refuse it? For you must choose, and not I. Therefore speak what
you know.

<span id="an_34:34">34:34</span> Men of understanding will tell me, yes,
every wise man who hears me:

<span id="an_34:35">34:35</span> 'Job speaks without knowledge. His
words are without wisdom.'

<span id="an_34:36">34:36</span> I wish that Job were tried to the end,
because of his answering like wicked men.

<span id="an_34:37">34:37</span> For he adds rebellion to his sin. He
claps his hands among us, and multiplies his words against God."

<span id="an_35:1">35:1</span> Moreover Elihu answered,

<span id="an_35:2">35:2</span> "Do you think this to be your right, or
do you say, 'My righteousness is more than God's,'

<span id="an_35:3">35:3</span> That you ask, 'What advantage will it be
to you? What profit shall I have, more than if I had sinned?'

<span id="an_35:4">35:4</span> I will answer you, and your companions
with you.

<span id="an_35:5">35:5</span> Look to the heavens, and see. See the
skies, which are higher than you.

<span id="an_35:6">35:6</span> If you have sinned, what effect do you
have against him? If your transgressions are multiplied, what do you do
to him?

<span id="an_35:7">35:7</span> If you are righteous, what do you give
him? Or what does he receive from your hand?

<span id="an_35:8">35:8</span> Your wickedness may hurt a man as you
are, and your righteousness may profit a son of man.

<span id="an_35:9">35:9</span> "By reason of the multitude of
oppressions they cry out. They cry for help by reason of the arm of the
mighty.

<span id="an_35:10">35:10</span> But none says, 'Where is God my Maker,
who gives songs in the night,

<span id="an_35:11">35:11</span> who teaches us more than the animals of
the earth, and makes us wiser than the birds of the sky?'

<span id="an_35:12">35:12</span> There they cry, but none gives answer,
because of the pride of evil men.

<span id="an_35:13">35:13</span> Surely God will not hear an empty cry,
neither will the Almighty regard it.

<span id="an_35:14">35:14</span> How much less when you say you don't
see him. The cause is before him, and you wait for him!

<span id="an_35:15">35:15</span> But now, because he has not visited in
his anger, neither does he greatly regard arrogance.

<span id="an_35:16">35:16</span> Therefore Job opens his mouth with
empty talk, and he multiplies words without knowledge."

<span id="an_36:1">36:1</span> Elihu also continued, and said,

<span id="an_36:2">36:2</span> "Bear with me a little, and I will show
you; for I still have something to say on God's behalf.

<span id="an_36:3">36:3</span> I will get my knowledge from afar, and
will ascribe righteousness to my Maker.

<span id="an_36:4">36:4</span> For truly my words are not false. One who
is perfect in knowledge is with you.

<span id="an_36:5">36:5</span> "Behold, God is mighty, and doesn't
despise anyone. He is mighty in strength of understanding.

<span id="an_36:6">36:6</span> He doesn't preserve the life of the
wicked, but gives to the afflicted their right.

<span id="an_36:7">36:7</span> He doesn't withdraw his eyes from the
righteous, but with kings on the throne, he sets them forever, and they
are exalted.

<span id="an_36:8">36:8</span> If they are bound in fetters, and are
taken in the cords of afflictions,

<span id="an_36:9">36:9</span> then he shows them their work, and their
transgressions, that they have behaved themselves proudly.

<span id="an_36:10">36:10</span> He also opens their ears to
instruction, and commands that they return from iniquity.

<span id="an_36:11">36:11</span> If they listen and serve him, they
shall spend their days in prosperity, and their years in pleasures.

<span id="an_36:12">36:12</span> But if they don't listen, they shall
perish by the sword; they shall die without knowledge.

<span id="an_36:13">36:13</span> "But those who are godless in heart lay
up anger. They don't cry for help when he binds them.

<span id="an_36:14">36:14</span> They die in youth. Their life perishes
among the unclean.

<span id="an_36:15">36:15</span> He delivers the afflicted by their
affliction, and opens their ear in oppression.

<span id="an_36:16">36:16</span> Yes, he would have allured you out of
distress, into a broad place, where there is no restriction. That which
is set on your table would be full of fatness.

<span id="an_36:17">36:17</span> "But you are full of the judgment of
the wicked. Judgment and justice take hold of you.

<span id="an_36:18">36:18</span> Don't let riches entice you to wrath,
neither let the great size of a bribe turn you aside.

<span id="an_36:19">36:19</span> Would your wealth sustain you in
distress, or all the might of your strength?

<span id="an_36:20">36:20</span> Don't desire the night, when people are
cut off in their place.

<span id="an_36:21">36:21</span> Take heed, don't regard iniquity; for
you have chosen this rather than affliction.

<span id="an_36:22">36:22</span> Behold, God is exalted in his power.
Who is a teacher like him?

<span id="an_36:23">36:23</span> Who has prescribed his way for him? Or
who can say, 'You have committed unrighteousness?'

<span id="an_36:24">36:24</span> "Remember that you magnify his work,
whereof men have sung.

<span id="an_36:25">36:25</span> All men have looked thereon. Man sees
it afar off.

<span id="an_36:26">36:26</span> Behold, God is great, and we don't know
him. The number of his years is unsearchable.

<span id="an_36:27">36:27</span> For he draws up the drops of water,
which distill in rain from his vapor,

<span id="an_36:28">36:28</span> Which the skies pour down and which
drop on man abundantly.

<span id="an_36:29">36:29</span> Yes, can any understand the spreading
of the clouds, and the thunderings of his pavilion?

<span id="an_36:30">36:30</span> Behold, he spreads his light around
him. He covers the bottom of the sea.

<span id="an_36:31">36:31</span> For by these he judges the people. He
gives food in abundance.

<span id="an_36:32">36:32</span> He covers his hands with the lightning,
and commands it to strike the mark.

<span id="an_36:33">36:33</span> Its noise tells about him, and the
livestock also concerning the storm that comes up.

<span id="an_37:1">37:1</span> "Yes, at this my heart trembles, and is
moved out of its place.

<span id="an_37:2">37:2</span> Hear, oh, hear the noise of his voice,
the sound that goes out of his mouth.

<span id="an_37:3">37:3</span> He sends it forth under the whole sky,
and his lightning to the ends of the earth.

<span id="an_37:4">37:4</span> After it a voice roars. He thunders with
the voice of his majesty. He doesn't hold back anything when his voice
is heard.

<span id="an_37:5">37:5</span> God thunders marvelously with his voice.
He does great things, which we can't comprehend.

<span id="an_37:6">37:6</span> For he says to the snow, 'Fall on the
earth;' likewise to the shower of rain, and to the showers of his mighty
rain.

<span id="an_37:7">37:7</span> He seals up the hand of every man, that
all men whom he has made may know it.

<span id="an_37:8">37:8</span> Then the animals take cover, and remain
in their dens.

<span id="an_37:9">37:9</span> Out of its room comes the storm, and cold
out of the north.

<span id="an_37:10">37:10</span> By the breath of God, ice is given, and
the breadth of the waters is frozen.

<span id="an_37:11">37:11</span> Yes, he loads the thick cloud with
moisture. He spreads abroad the cloud of his lightning.

<span id="an_37:12">37:12</span> It is turned around by his guidance,
that they may do whatever he commands them on the surface of the
habitable world,

<span id="an_37:13">37:13</span> Whether it is for correction, or for
his land, or for loving kindness, that he causes it to come.

<span id="an_37:14">37:14</span> "Listen to this, Job. Stand still, and
consider the wondrous works of God.

<span id="an_37:15">37:15</span> Do you know how God controls them, and
causes the lightning of his cloud to shine?

<span id="an_37:16">37:16</span> Do you know the workings of the clouds,
the wondrous works of him who is perfect in knowledge?

<span id="an_37:17">37:17</span> You whose clothing is warm, when the
earth is still by reason of the south wind?

<span id="an_37:18">37:18</span> Can you, with him, spread out the sky,
which is strong as a cast metal mirror?

<span id="an_37:19">37:19</span> Teach us what we shall tell him, for we
can't make our case by reason of darkness.

<span id="an_37:20">37:20</span> Shall it be told him that I would
speak? Or should a man wish that he were swallowed up?

<span id="an_37:21">37:21</span> Now men don't see the light which is
bright in the skies, but the wind passes, and clears them.

<span id="an_37:22">37:22</span> Out of the north comes golden splendor.
With God is awesome majesty.

<span id="an_37:23">37:23</span> We can't reach the Almighty. He is
exalted in power. In justice and great righteousness, he will not
oppress.

<span id="an_37:24">37:24</span> Therefore men revere him. He doesn't
regard any who are wise of heart."

<span id="an_38:1">38:1</span> Then Yahweh answered Job out of the
whirlwind,

<span id="an_38:2">38:2</span> "Who is this who darkens counsel by words
without knowledge?

<span id="an_38:3">38:3</span> Brace yourself like a man, for I will
question you, then you answer me!

<span id="an_38:4">38:4</span> "Where were you when I laid the
foundations of the earth? Declare, if you have understanding.

<span id="an_38:5">38:5</span> Who determined its measures, if you know?
Or who stretched the line on it?

<span id="an_38:6">38:6</span> Whereupon were its foundations fastened?
Or who laid its cornerstone,

<span id="an_38:7">38:7</span> when the morning stars sang together, and
all the sons of God shouted for joy?

<span id="an_38:8">38:8</span> "Or who shut up the sea with doors, when
it broke forth from the womb,

<span id="an_38:9">38:9</span> when I made clouds its garment, and
wrapped it in thick darkness,

<span id="an_38:10">38:10</span> marked out for it my bound, set bars
and doors,

<span id="an_38:11">38:11</span> and said, 'Here you may come, but no
further. Here your proud waves shall be stayed?'

<span id="an_38:12">38:12</span> "Have you commanded the morning in your
days, and caused the dawn to know its place;

<span id="an_38:13">38:13</span> that it might take hold of the ends of
the earth, and shake the wicked out of it?

<span id="an_38:14">38:14</span> It is changed as clay under the seal,
and stands forth as a garment.

<span id="an_38:15">38:15</span> From the wicked, their light is
withheld. The high arm is broken.

<span id="an_38:16">38:16</span> "Have you entered into the springs of
the sea? Or have you walked in the recesses of the deep?

<span id="an_38:17">38:17</span> Have the gates of death been revealed
to you? Or have you seen the gates of the shadow of death?

<span id="an_38:18">38:18</span> Have you comprehended the earth in its
breadth? Declare, if you know it all.

<span id="an_38:19">38:19</span> "What is the way to the dwelling of
light? As for darkness, where is its place,

<span id="an_38:20">38:20</span> that you should take it to its bound,
that you should discern the paths to its house?

<span id="an_38:21">38:21</span> Surely you know, for you were born
then, and the number of your days is great!

<span id="an_38:22">38:22</span> Have you entered the treasuries of the
snow, or have you seen the treasures of the hail,

<span id="an_38:23">38:23</span> which I have reserved against the time
of trouble, against the day of battle and war?

<span id="an_38:24">38:24</span> By what way is the lightning
distributed, or the east wind scattered on the earth?

<span id="an_38:25">38:25</span> Who has cut a channel for the flood
water, or the path for the thunderstorm;

<span id="an_38:26">38:26</span> To cause it to rain on a land where no
man is; on the wilderness, in which there is no man;

<span id="an_38:27">38:27</span> to satisfy the waste and desolate
ground, to cause the tender grass to spring forth?

<span id="an_38:28">38:28</span> Does the rain have a father? Or who
fathers the drops of dew?

<span id="an_38:29">38:29</span> Out of whose womb came the ice? The
gray frost of the sky, who has given birth to it?

<span id="an_38:30">38:30</span> The waters become hard like stone, when
the surface of the deep is frozen.

<span id="an_38:31">38:31</span> "Can you bind the cluster of the
Pleiades, or loosen the cords of Orion?

<span id="an_38:32">38:32</span> Can you lead forth the constellations
in their season? Or can you guide the Bear with her cubs?

<span id="an_38:33">38:33</span> Do you know the laws of the heavens?
Can you establish its dominion over the earth?

<span id="an_38:34">38:34</span> "Can you lift up your voice to the
clouds, That abundance of waters may cover you?

<span id="an_38:35">38:35</span> Can you send forth lightnings, that
they may go? Do they report to you, 'Here we are?'

<span id="an_38:36">38:36</span> Who has put wisdom in the inward parts?
Or who has given understanding to the mind?

<span id="an_38:37">38:37</span> Who can number the clouds by wisdom? Or
who can pour out the bottles of the sky,

<span id="an_38:38">38:38</span> when the dust runs into a mass, and the
clods of earth stick together?

<span id="an_38:39">38:39</span> "Can you hunt the prey for the lioness,
or satisfy the appetite of the young lions,

<span id="an_38:40">38:40</span> when they crouch in their dens, and lie
in wait in the thicket?

<span id="an_38:41">38:41</span> Who provides for the raven his prey,
when his young ones cry to God, and wander for lack of food?

<span id="an_39:1">39:1</span> "Do you know the time when the mountain
goats give birth? Do you watch when the doe bears fawns?

<span id="an_39:2">39:2</span> Can you number the months that they
fulfill? Or do you know the time when they give birth?

<span id="an_39:3">39:3</span> They bow themselves, they bring forth
their young, they end their labor pains.

<span id="an_39:4">39:4</span> Their young ones become strong. They grow
up in the open field. They go forth, and don't return again.

<span id="an_39:5">39:5</span> "Who has set the wild donkey free? Or who
has loosened the bonds of the swift donkey,

<span id="an_39:6">39:6</span> Whose home I have made the wilderness,
and the salt land his dwelling place?

<span id="an_39:7">39:7</span> He scorns the tumult of the city, neither
does he hear the shouting of the driver.

<span id="an_39:8">39:8</span> The range of the mountains is his
pasture, He searches after every green thing.

<span id="an_39:9">39:9</span> "Will the wild ox be content to serve
you? Or will he stay by your feeding trough?

<span id="an_39:10">39:10</span> Can you hold the wild ox in the furrow
with his harness? Or will he till the valleys after you?

<span id="an_39:11">39:11</span> Will you trust him, because his
strength is great? Or will you leave to him your labor?

<span id="an_39:12">39:12</span> Will you confide in him, that he will
bring home your seed, and gather the grain of your threshing floor?

<span id="an_39:13">39:13</span> "The wings of the ostrich wave proudly;
but are they the feathers and plumage of love?

<span id="an_39:14">39:14</span> For she leaves her eggs on the earth,
warms them in the dust,

<span id="an_39:15">39:15</span> and forgets that the foot may crush
them, or that the wild animal may trample them.

<span id="an_39:16">39:16</span> She deals harshly with her young ones,
as if they were not hers. Though her labor is in vain, she is without
fear,

<span id="an_39:17">39:17</span> because God has deprived her of wisdom,
neither has he imparted to her understanding.

<span id="an_39:18">39:18</span> When she lifts up herself on high, she
scorns the horse and his rider.

<span id="an_39:19">39:19</span> "Have you given the horse might? Have
you clothed his neck with a quivering mane?

<span id="an_39:20">39:20</span> Have you made him to leap as a locust?
The glory of his snorting is awesome.

<span id="an_39:21">39:21</span> He paws in the valley, and rejoices in
his strength. He goes out to meet the armed men.

<span id="an_39:22">39:22</span> He mocks at fear, and is not dismayed,
neither does he turn back from the sword.

<span id="an_39:23">39:23</span> The quiver rattles against him, the
flashing spear and the javelin.

<span id="an_39:24">39:24</span> He eats up the ground with fierceness
and rage, neither does he stand still at the sound of the trumpet.

<span id="an_39:25">39:25</span> As often as the trumpet sounds he
snorts, 'Aha!' He smells the battle afar off, the thunder of the
captains, and the shouting.

<span id="an_39:26">39:26</span> "Is it by your wisdom that the hawk
soars, and stretches her wings toward the south?

<span id="an_39:27">39:27</span> Is it at your command that the eagle
mounts up, and makes his nest on high?

<span id="an_39:28">39:28</span> On the cliff he dwells, and makes his
home, on the point of the cliff, and the stronghold.

<span id="an_39:29">39:29</span> From there he spies out the prey. His
eyes see it afar off.

<span id="an_39:30">39:30</span> His young ones also suck up blood.
Where the slain are, there he is."

<span id="an_40:1">40:1</span> Moreover Yahweh answered Job,

<span id="an_40:2">40:2</span> "Shall he who argues contend with the
Almighty? He who argues with God, let him answer it."

<span id="an_40:3">40:3</span> Then Job answered Yahweh,

<span id="an_40:4">40:4</span> "Behold, I am of small account. What
shall I answer you? I lay my hand on my mouth.

<span id="an_40:5">40:5</span> I have spoken once, and I will not
answer; Yes, twice, but I will proceed no further."

<span id="an_40:6">40:6</span> Then Yahweh answered Job out of the
whirlwind,

<span id="an_40:7">40:7</span> "Now brace yourself like a man. I will
question you, and you will answer me.

<span id="an_40:8">40:8</span> Will you even annul my judgment? Will you
condemn me, that you may be justified?

<span id="an_40:9">40:9</span> Or do you have an arm like God? Can you
thunder with a voice like him?

<span id="an_40:10">40:10</span> "Now deck yourself with excellency and
dignity. Array yourself with honor and majesty.

<span id="an_40:11">40:11</span> Pour out the fury of your anger. Look
at everyone who is proud, and bring him low.

<span id="an_40:12">40:12</span> Look at everyone who is proud, and
humble him. Crush the wicked in their place.

<span id="an_40:13">40:13</span> Hide them in the dust together. Bind
their faces in the hidden place.

<span id="an_40:14">40:14</span> Then I will also admit to you that your
own right hand can save you.

<span id="an_40:15">40:15</span> "See now, behemoth, which I made as
well as you. He eats grass as an ox.

<span id="an_40:16">40:16</span> Look now, his strength is in his
thighs. His force is in the muscles of his belly.

<span id="an_40:17">40:17</span> He moves his tail like a cedar. The
sinews of his thighs are knit together.

<span id="an_40:18">40:18</span> His bones are like tubes of brass. His
limbs are like bars of iron.

<span id="an_40:19">40:19</span> He is the chief of the ways of God. He
who made him gives him his sword.

<span id="an_40:20">40:20</span> Surely the mountains produce food for
him, where all the animals of the field play.

<span id="an_40:21">40:21</span> He lies under the lotus trees, in the
covert of the reed, and the marsh.

<span id="an_40:22">40:22</span> The lotuses cover him with their shade.
The willows of the brook surround him.

<span id="an_40:23">40:23</span> Behold, if a river overflows, he
doesn't tremble. He is confident, though the Jordan swells even to his
mouth.

<span id="an_40:24">40:24</span> Shall any take him when he is on the
watch, or pierce through his nose with a snare?

<span id="an_41:1">41:1</span> "Can you draw out Leviathan with a
fishhook, or press down his tongue with a cord?

<span id="an_41:2">41:2</span> Can you put a rope into his nose, or
pierce his jaw through with a hook?

<span id="an_41:3">41:3</span> Will he make many petitions to you, or
will he speak soft words to you?

<span id="an_41:4">41:4</span> Will he make a covenant with you, that
you should take him for a servant forever?

<span id="an_41:5">41:5</span> Will you play with him as with a bird? Or
will you bind him for your girls?

<span id="an_41:6">41:6</span> Will traders barter for him? Will they
part him among the merchants?

<span id="an_41:7">41:7</span> Can you fill his skin with barbed irons,
or his head with fish spears?

<span id="an_41:8">41:8</span> Lay your hand on him. Remember the
battle, and do so no more.

<span id="an_41:9">41:9</span> Behold, the hope of him is in vain. Won't
one be cast down even at the sight of him?

<span id="an_41:10">41:10</span> None is so fierce that he dare stir him
up. Who then is he who can stand before me?

<span id="an_41:11">41:11</span> Who has first given to me, that I
should repay him? Everything under the heavens is mine.

<span id="an_41:12">41:12</span> "I will not keep silence concerning his
limbs, nor his mighty strength, nor his goodly frame.

<span id="an_41:13">41:13</span> Who can strip off his outer garment?
Who shall come within his jaws?

<span id="an_41:14">41:14</span> Who can open the doors of his face?
Around his teeth is terror.

<span id="an_41:15">41:15</span> Strong scales are his pride, shut up
together with a close seal.

<span id="an_41:16">41:16</span> One is so near to another, that no air
can come between them.

<span id="an_41:17">41:17</span> They are joined one to another. They
stick together, so that they can't be pulled apart.

<span id="an_41:18">41:18</span> His sneezing flashes out light. His
eyes are like the eyelids of the morning.

<span id="an_41:19">41:19</span> Out of his mouth go burning torches.
Sparks of fire leap forth.

<span id="an_41:20">41:20</span> Out of his nostrils a smoke goes, as of
a boiling pot over a fire of reeds.

<span id="an_41:21">41:21</span> His breath kindles coals. A flame goes
forth from his mouth.

<span id="an_41:22">41:22</span> There is strength in his neck. Terror
dances before him.

<span id="an_41:23">41:23</span> The flakes of his flesh are joined
together. They are firm on him. They can't be moved.

<span id="an_41:24">41:24</span> His heart is as firm as a stone, yes,
firm as the lower millstone.

<span id="an_41:25">41:25</span> When he raises himself up, the mighty
are afraid. They retreat before his thrashing.

<span id="an_41:26">41:26</span> If one attacks him with the sword, it
can't prevail; nor the spear, the dart, nor the pointed shaft.

<span id="an_41:27">41:27</span> He counts iron as straw; and brass as
rotten wood.

<span id="an_41:28">41:28</span> The arrow can't make him flee. Sling
stones are like chaff to him.

<span id="an_41:29">41:29</span> Clubs are counted as stubble. He laughs
at the rushing of the javelin.

<span id="an_41:30">41:30</span> His undersides are like sharp
potsherds, leaving a trail in the mud like a threshing sledge.

<span id="an_41:31">41:31</span> He makes the deep to boil like a pot.
He makes the sea like a pot of ointment.

<span id="an_41:32">41:32</span> He makes a path shine after him. One
would think the deep had white hair.

<span id="an_41:33">41:33</span> On earth there is not his equal, that
is made without fear.

<span id="an_41:34">41:34</span> He sees everything that is high. He is
king over all the sons of pride."

<span id="an_42:1">42:1</span> Then Job answered Yahweh,

<span id="an_42:2">42:2</span> "I know that you can do all things, and
that no purpose of yours can be restrained.

<span id="an_42:3">42:3</span> You asked, 'Who is this who hides counsel
without knowledge?' therefore I have uttered that which I did not
understand, things too wonderful for me, which I didn't know.

<span id="an_42:4">42:4</span> You said, 'Listen, now, and I will speak;
I will question you, and you will answer me.'

<span id="an_42:5">42:5</span> I had heard of you by the hearing of the
ear, but now my eye sees you.

<span id="an_42:6">42:6</span> Therefore I abhor myself, and repent in
dust and ashes."

<span id="an_42:7">42:7</span> It was so, that after Yahweh had spoken
these words to Job, Yahweh said to Eliphaz the Temanite, "My wrath is
kindled against you, and against your two friends; for you have not
spoken of me the thing that is right, as my servant Job has.

<span id="an_42:8">42:8</span> Now therefore, take to yourselves seven
bulls and seven rams, and go to my servant Job, and offer up for
yourselves a burnt offering; and my servant Job shall pray for you, for
I will accept him, that I not deal with you according to your folly. For
you have not spoken of me the thing that is right, as my servant Job
has."

<span id="an_42:9">42:9</span> So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the
Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite went, and did what Yahweh commanded
them, and Yahweh accepted Job.

<span id="an_42:10">42:10</span> Yahweh turned the captivity of Job,
when he prayed for his friends. Yahweh gave Job twice as much as he had
before.

<span id="an_42:11">42:11</span> Then came there to him all his
brothers, and all his sisters, and all those who had been of his
acquaintance before, and ate bread with him in his house. They comforted
him, and consoled him concerning all the evil that Yahweh had brought on
him. Everyone also gave him a piece of money, and everyone a ring of
gold.

<span id="an_42:12">42:12</span> So Yahweh blessed the latter end of Job
more than his beginning. He had fourteen thousand sheep, six thousand
camels, one thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand female donkeys.

<span id="an_42:13">42:13</span> He had also seven sons and three
daughters.

<span id="an_42:14">42:14</span> He called the name of the first,
Jemimah; and the name of the second, Keziah; and the name of the third,
Keren Happuch.

<span id="an_42:15">42:15</span> In all the land were no women found so
beautiful as the daughters of Job. Their father gave them an inheritance
among their brothers.

<span id="an_42:16">42:16</span> After this Job lived one hundred forty
years, and saw his sons, and his sons' sons, to four generations.

<span id="an_42:17">42:17</span> So Job died, being old and full of
days. BOOK I
