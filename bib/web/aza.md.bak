### World English Bible: Prayer of Azariah

<span id="an_1:1">1:1</span> And they walked in the midst of the fire,
praising God and blessing the Lord.

<span id="an_1:2">1:2</span> Then Azariah stood up and prayed in this
way; and opening his mouth in the midst of the fire, he said,

<span id="an_1:3">1:3</span> "Blessed are you, O Lord God of our
fathers; your name is worthy to be praised and glorified for evermore:

<span id="an_1:4">1:4</span> For you are righteous in all the things
which you have done to us; yes, true are all your works, your ways are
right, and all your judgments are truth.

<span id="an_1:5">1:5</span> In all the things which you have brought
upon us and upon the holy city of our fathers, even Jerusalem, you have
executed true judgment; for according to truth and judgment you brought
all these things upon us because of our sins.

<span id="an_1:6">1:6</span> For we have sinned and committed iniquity,
departing from you.

<span id="an_1:7">1:7</span> In all things have we trespassed and not
obeyed your commandments, nor kept them, neither have we done as you
have commanded us, so that it might go well with us.

<span id="an_1:8">1:8</span> Therefore all that you have brought upon us
and everything which you have done to us, you have done in true
judgment.

<span id="an_1:9">1:9</span> And you delivered us into the hands of
lawless enemies, most hateful forsakers of God, and to an unjust king,
the most wicked in all the world.

<span id="an_1:10">1:10</span> And now we cannot open our mouths; we
have become a shame and a reproach to your servants and to those who
worship you.

<span id="an_1:11">1:11</span> Yet do not deliver us up completely, for
your name's sake, nor completely annul your covenant.

<span id="an_1:12">1:12</span> And do not cause your mercy to depart
from us, for your beloved Abraham's sake, for your servant Isaac's sake,
and for your holy Israel's sake,

<span id="an_1:13">1:13</span> to whom you have spoken and promised that
you would multiply their seed as the stars of heaven and as the sand
which lies upon the seashore.

<span id="an_1:14">1:14</span> For we, O Lord, have become less than any
nation and are oppressed this day in all the world because of our sins.

<span id="an_1:15">1:15</span> Neither is there at this time any prince,
or prophet, or leader, or burnt offering, or sacrifice, or oblation, or
incense, or place, to sacrifice before you in order to find mercy.

<span id="an_1:16">1:16</span> Nevertheless, with a contrite heart and a
humble spirit, let us be accepted.

<span id="an_1:17">1:17</span> Just as in the burnt offerings of rams
and bullocks, and just as in ten thousands of fat lambs, so let it be
with our sacrifice in your sight on this day; and grant that we may
completely follow you, for those who put their trust in you shall not be
confounded.

<span id="an_1:18">1:18</span> And now we follow you with all our heart;
we fear you and seek your face.

<span id="an_1:19">1:19</span> Do not put us to shame, but deal with us
according to your loving kindness and according to the multitude of your
mercies.

<span id="an_1:20">1:20</span> Deliver us also according to your
marvelous works and give glory to your name, O Lord; and let all those
who do harm to your servants be ashamed;

<span id="an_1:21">1:21</span> and let them be confounded in all their
power and might, and let their strength be broken;

<span id="an_1:22">1:22</span> and let them know that you are God, the
only God, and glorious over the whole world."

<span id="an_1:23">1:23</span> And the king's servants, who put them in,
continued to make the oven hot with resin, pitch, tow, and small wood,

<span id="an_1:24">1:24</span> so that the flame streamed forth above
the furnace for forty nine cubits.

<span id="an_1:25">1:25</span> And it passed through and burned those
Chaldeans it found around the furnace.

<span id="an_1:26">1:26</span> But the angel of the Lord came down into
the oven, together with Azariah and his peers, and drove the flame of
the fire out of the oven,

<span id="an_1:27">1:27</span> and made the middle of the furnace like a
moist whistling wind, so that the fire did not touch them at all and
neither hurt nor troubled them.

<span id="an_1:28">1:28</span> Then the three, as out of one mouth,
praised, glorified, and blessed God in the furnace, saying:

<span id="an_1:29">1:29</span> "Blessed are you, O Lord God of our
fathers; and praised and exalted above all for ever. And blessed is your
glorious and holy name; and praised and exalted above all for ever.

<span id="an_1:30">1:30</span> Blessed are you in the temple of your
holy glory; and praised and glorified above all for ever.

your kingdom; and praised and glorified above all for ever.

while sitting upon the cherubims; and praised and exalted above all for
ever.

heaven; and above all praised and glorified for ever.

praise and exalt him above all for ever.

exalt him above all for ever.

and exalt him above all for ever.

praise and exalt him above all for ever.

exalt him above all for ever.

from hell, and saved us from the hand of death, and delivered us out of
the midst of the furnace and burning flame; even out of the midst of the
fire he has delivered us.

gracious, for his mercy endures for ever.
