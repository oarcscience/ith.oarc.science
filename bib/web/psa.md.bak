### World English Bible: Psalms

<span id="an_1:1">1:1</span> Blessed is the man who doesn't walk in the
counsel of the wicked, nor stand in the way of sinners, nor sit in the
seat of scoffers;

<span id="an_1:2">1:2</span> but his delight is in Yahweh's law. On his
law he meditates day and night.

<span id="an_1:3">1:3</span> He will be like a tree planted by the
streams of water, that brings forth its fruit in its season, whose leaf
also does not wither. Whatever he does shall prosper.

<span id="an_1:4">1:4</span> The wicked are not so, but are like the
chaff which the wind drives away.

<span id="an_1:5">1:5</span> Therefore the wicked shall not stand in the
judgment, nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous.

<span id="an_1:6">1:6</span> For Yahweh knows the way of the righteous,
but the way of the wicked shall perish.

<span id="an_2:1">2:1</span> Why do the nations rage, and the peoples
plot a vain thing?

<span id="an_2:2">2:2</span> The kings of the earth take a stand, and
the rulers take counsel together, against Yahweh, and against his
Anointed, saying,

<span id="an_2:3">2:3</span> "Let's break their bonds apart, and cast
their cords from us."

<span id="an_2:4">2:4</span> He who sits in the heavens will laugh. The
Lord will have them in derision.

<span id="an_2:5">2:5</span> Then he will speak to them in his anger,
and terrify them in his wrath:

<span id="an_2:6">2:6</span> "Yet I have set my King on my holy hill of
Zion."

<span id="an_2:7">2:7</span> I will tell of the decree. Yahweh said to
me, "You are my son. Today I have become your father.

<span id="an_2:8">2:8</span> Ask of me, and I will give the nations for
your inheritance, the uttermost parts of the earth for your possession.

<span id="an_2:9">2:9</span> You shall break them with a rod of iron.
You shall dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel."

<span id="an_2:10">2:10</span> Now therefore be wise, you kings. Be
instructed, you judges of the earth.

<span id="an_2:11">2:11</span> Serve Yahweh with fear, and rejoice with
trembling.

<span id="an_2:12">2:12</span> Give sincere homage to the Son, lest he
be angry, and you perish in the way, for his wrath will soon be kindled.
Blessed are all those who take refuge in him. A Psalm by David, when he
fled from Absalom his son.

<span id="an_3:1">3:1</span> Yahweh, how my adversaries have increased!
Many are those who rise up against me.

<span id="an_3:2">3:2</span> Many there are who say of my soul, "There
is no help for him in God." Selah.

<span id="an_3:3">3:3</span> But you, Yahweh, are a shield around me, my
glory, and the one who lifts up my head.

<span id="an_3:4">3:4</span> I cry to Yahweh with my voice, and he
answers me out of his holy hill. Selah.

<span id="an_3:5">3:5</span> I laid myself down and slept. I awakened;
for Yahweh sustains me.

<span id="an_3:6">3:6</span> I will not be afraid of tens of thousands
of people who have set themselves against me on every side.

<span id="an_3:7">3:7</span> Arise, Yahweh! Save me, my God! For you
have struck all of my enemies on the cheek bone. You have broken the
teeth of the wicked.

<span id="an_3:8">3:8</span> Salvation belongs to Yahweh. Your blessing
be on your people. Selah. For the Chief Musician; on stringed
instruments. A Psalm by David.

<span id="an_4:1">4:1</span> Answer me when I call, God of my
righteousness. Give me relief from my distress. Have mercy on me, and
hear my prayer.

<span id="an_4:2">4:2</span> You sons of men, how long shall my glory be
turned into dishonor? Will you love vanity, and seek after falsehood?
Selah.

<span id="an_4:3">4:3</span> But know that Yahweh has set apart for
himself him who is godly: Yahweh will hear when I call to him.

<span id="an_4:4">4:4</span> Stand in awe, and don't sin. Search your
own heart on your bed, and be still. Selah.

<span id="an_4:5">4:5</span> Offer the sacrifices of righteousness. Put
your trust in Yahweh.

<span id="an_4:6">4:6</span> Many say, "Who will show us any good?"
Yahweh, let the light of your face shine on us.

<span id="an_4:7">4:7</span> You have put gladness in my heart, more
than when their grain and their new wine are increased.

<span id="an_4:8">4:8</span> In peace I will both lay myself down and
sleep, for you, Yahweh alone, make me live in safety. For the Chief
Musician, with the flutes. A Psalm by David.

<span id="an_5:1">5:1</span> Give ear to my words, Yahweh. Consider my
meditation.

<span id="an_5:2">5:2</span> Listen to the voice of my cry, my King and
my God; for to you do I pray.

<span id="an_5:3">5:3</span> Yahweh, in the morning you shall hear my
voice. In the morning I will lay my requests before you, and will watch
expectantly.

<span id="an_5:4">5:4</span> For you are not a God who has pleasure in
wickedness. Evil can't live with you.

<span id="an_5:5">5:5</span> The arrogant shall not stand in your sight.
You hate all workers of iniquity.

<span id="an_5:6">5:6</span> You will destroy those who speak lies.
Yahweh abhors the bloodthirsty and deceitful man.

<span id="an_5:7">5:7</span> But as for me, in the abundance of your
loving kindness I will come into your house. I will bow toward your holy
temple in reverence of you.

<span id="an_5:8">5:8</span> Lead me, Yahweh, in your righteousness
because of my enemies. Make your way straight before my face.

<span id="an_5:9">5:9</span> For there is no faithfulness in their
mouth. Their heart is destruction. Their throat is an open tomb. They
flatter with their tongue.

<span id="an_5:10">5:10</span> Hold them guilty, God. Let them fall by
their own counsels; Thrust them out in the multitude of their
transgressions, for they have rebelled against you.

<span id="an_5:11">5:11</span> But let all those who take refuge in you
rejoice, Let them always shout for joy, because you defend them. Let
them also who love your name be joyful in you.

<span id="an_5:12">5:12</span> For you will bless the righteous. Yahweh,
you will surround him with favor as with a shield. For the Chief
Musician; on stringed instruments, upon the eight-stringed lyre. A Psalm
by David.

<span id="an_6:1">6:1</span> Yahweh, don't rebuke me in your anger,
neither discipline me in your wrath.

<span id="an_6:2">6:2</span> Have mercy on me, Yahweh, for I am faint.
Yahweh, heal me, for my bones are troubled.

<span id="an_6:3">6:3</span> My soul is also in great anguish. But you,
Yahweh--how long?

<span id="an_6:4">6:4</span> Return, Yahweh. Deliver my soul, and save
me for your loving kindness' sake.

<span id="an_6:5">6:5</span> For in death there is no memory of you. In
Sheol, who shall give you thanks?

<span id="an_6:6">6:6</span> I am weary with my groaning. Every night I
flood my bed. I drench my couch with my tears.

<span id="an_6:7">6:7</span> My eye wastes away because of grief. It
grows old because of all my adversaries.

<span id="an_6:8">6:8</span> Depart from me, all you workers of
iniquity, for Yahweh has heard the voice of my weeping.

<span id="an_6:9">6:9</span> Yahweh has heard my supplication. Yahweh
accepts my prayer.

<span id="an_6:10">6:10</span> May all my enemies be ashamed and
dismayed. They shall turn back, they shall be disgraced suddenly. A
meditation by David, which he sang to Yahweh, concerning the words of
Cush, the Benjamite.

<span id="an_7:1">7:1</span> Yahweh, my God, I take refuge in you. Save
me from all those who pursue me, and deliver me,

<span id="an_7:2">7:2</span> lest they tear apart my soul like a lion,
ripping it in pieces, while there is none to deliver.

<span id="an_7:3">7:3</span> Yahweh, my God, if I have done this, if
there is iniquity in my hands,

<span id="an_7:4">7:4</span> if I have rewarded evil to him who was at
peace with me (yes, if I have delivered him who without cause was my
adversary),

<span id="an_7:5">7:5</span> let the enemy pursue my soul, and overtake
it; yes, let him tread my life down to the earth, and lay my glory in
the dust. Selah.

<span id="an_7:6">7:6</span> Arise, Yahweh, in your anger. Lift up
yourself against the rage of my adversaries. Awake for me. You have
commanded judgment.

<span id="an_7:7">7:7</span> Let the congregation of the peoples
surround you. Rule over them on high.

<span id="an_7:8">7:8</span> Yahweh administers judgment to the peoples.
Judge me, Yahweh, according to my righteousness, and to my integrity
that is in me.

<span id="an_7:9">7:9</span> Oh let the wickedness of the wicked come to
an end, but establish the righteous; their minds and hearts are searched
by the righteous God.

<span id="an_7:10">7:10</span> My shield is with God, who saves the
upright in heart.

<span id="an_7:11">7:11</span> God is a righteous judge, yes, a God who
has indignation every day.

<span id="an_7:12">7:12</span> If a man doesn't relent, he will sharpen
his sword; he has bent and strung his bow.

<span id="an_7:13">7:13</span> He has also prepared for himself the
instruments of death. He makes ready his flaming arrows.

<span id="an_7:14">7:14</span> Behold, he travails with iniquity. Yes,
he has conceived mischief, and brought forth falsehood.

<span id="an_7:15">7:15</span> He has dug a hole, and has fallen into
the pit which he made.

<span id="an_7:16">7:16</span> The trouble he causes shall return to his
own head. His violence shall come down on the crown of his own head.

<span id="an_7:17">7:17</span> I will give thanks to Yahweh according to
his righteousness, and will sing praise to the name of Yahweh Most High.
For the Chief Musician; on an instrument of Gath. A Psalm by David.

<span id="an_8:1">8:1</span> Yahweh, our Lord, how majestic is your name
in all the earth, who has set your glory above the heavens!

<span id="an_8:2">8:2</span> From the lips of babes and infants you have
established strength, because of your adversaries, that you might
silence the enemy and the avenger.

<span id="an_8:3">8:3</span> When I consider your heavens, the work of
your fingers, the moon and the stars, which you have ordained;

<span id="an_8:4">8:4</span> what is man, that you think of him? What is
the son of man, that you care for him?

<span id="an_8:5">8:5</span> For you have made him a little lower than
God, and crowned him with glory and honor.

<span id="an_8:6">8:6</span> You make him ruler over the works of your
hands. You have put all things under his feet:

<span id="an_8:7">8:7</span> All sheep and cattle, yes, and the animals
of the field,

<span id="an_8:8">8:8</span> The birds of the sky, the fish of the sea,
and whatever passes through the paths of the seas.

<span id="an_8:9">8:9</span> Yahweh, our Lord, how majestic is your name
in all the earth! For the Chief Musician. Set to "The Death of the Son."
A Psalm by David.

<span id="an_9:1">9:1</span> I will give thanks to Yahweh with my whole
heart. I will tell of all your marvelous works.

<span id="an_9:2">9:2</span> I will be glad and rejoice in you. I will
sing praise to your name, O Most High.

<span id="an_9:3">9:3</span> When my enemies turn back, they stumble and
perish in your presence.

<span id="an_9:4">9:4</span> For you have maintained my just cause. You
sit on the throne judging righteously.

<span id="an_9:5">9:5</span> You have rebuked the nations. You have
destroyed the wicked. You have blotted out their name forever and ever.

<span id="an_9:6">9:6</span> The enemy is overtaken by endless ruin. The
very memory of the cities which you have overthrown has perished.

<span id="an_9:7">9:7</span> But Yahweh reigns forever. He has prepared
his throne for judgment.

<span id="an_9:8">9:8</span> He will judge the world in righteousness.
He will administer judgment to the peoples in uprightness.

<span id="an_9:9">9:9</span> Yahweh will also be a high tower for the
oppressed; a high tower in times of trouble.

<span id="an_9:10">9:10</span> Those who know your name will put their
trust in you, for you, Yahweh, have not forsaken those who seek you.

<span id="an_9:11">9:11</span> Sing praises to Yahweh, who dwells in
Zion, and declare among the people what he has done.

<span id="an_9:12">9:12</span> For he who avenges blood remembers them.
He doesn't forget the cry of the afflicted.

<span id="an_9:13">9:13</span> Have mercy on me, Yahweh. See my
affliction by those who hate me, and lift me up from the gates of death;

<span id="an_9:14">9:14</span> that I may show forth all your praise. In
the gates of the daughter of Zion, I will rejoice in your salvation.

<span id="an_9:15">9:15</span> The nations have sunk down in the pit
that they made. In the net which they hid, their own foot is taken.

<span id="an_9:16">9:16</span> Yahweh has made himself known. He has
executed judgment. The wicked is snared by the work of his own hands.
Meditation. Selah.

<span id="an_9:17">9:17</span> The wicked shall be turned back to Sheol,
even all the nations that forget God.

<span id="an_9:18">9:18</span> For the needy shall not always be
forgotten, nor the hope of the poor perish forever.

<span id="an_9:19">9:19</span> Arise, Yahweh! Don't let man prevail. Let
the nations be judged in your sight.

<span id="an_9:20">9:20</span> Put them in fear, Yahweh. Let the nations
know that they are only men. Selah.

<span id="an_10:1">10:1</span> Why do you stand far off, Yahweh? Why do
you hide yourself in times of trouble?

<span id="an_10:2">10:2</span> In arrogance, the wicked hunt down the
weak. They are caught in the schemes that they devise.

<span id="an_10:3">10:3</span> For the wicked boasts of his heart's
cravings. He blesses the greedy, and condemns Yahweh.

<span id="an_10:4">10:4</span> The wicked, in the pride of his face, has
no room in his thoughts for God.

<span id="an_10:5">10:5</span> His ways are prosperous at all times. He
is haughty, and your laws are far from his sight. As for all his
adversaries, he sneers at them.

<span id="an_10:6">10:6</span> He says in his heart, "I shall not be
shaken. For generations I shall have no trouble."

<span id="an_10:7">10:7</span> His mouth is full of cursing, deceit, and
oppression. Under his tongue is mischief and iniquity.

<span id="an_10:8">10:8</span> He lies in wait near the villages. From
ambushes, he murders the innocent. His eyes are secretly set against the
helpless.

<span id="an_10:9">10:9</span> He lurks in secret as a lion in his
ambush. He lies in wait to catch the helpless. He catches the helpless,
when he draws him in his net.

<span id="an_10:10">10:10</span> The helpless are crushed. They
collapse. They fall under his strength.

<span id="an_10:11">10:11</span> He says in his heart, "God has
forgotten. He hides his face. He will never see it."

<span id="an_10:12">10:12</span> Arise, Yahweh! God, lift up your hand!
Don't forget the helpless.

<span id="an_10:13">10:13</span> Why does the wicked person condemn God,
and say in his heart, "God won't call me into account?"

<span id="an_10:14">10:14</span> But you do see trouble and grief. You
consider it to take it into your hand. You help the victim and the
fatherless.

<span id="an_10:15">10:15</span> Break the arm of the wicked. As for the
evil man, seek out his wickedness until you find none.

<span id="an_10:16">10:16</span> Yahweh is King forever and ever! The
nations will perish out of his land.

<span id="an_10:17">10:17</span> Yahweh, you have heard the desire of
the humble. You will prepare their heart. You will cause your ear to
hear,

<span id="an_10:18">10:18</span> to judge the fatherless and the
oppressed, that man who is of the earth may terrify no more. For the
Chief Musician. By David.

<span id="an_11:1">11:1</span> In Yahweh, I take refuge. How can you say
to my soul, "Flee as a bird to your mountain!"

<span id="an_11:2">11:2</span> For, behold, the wicked bend their bows.
They set their arrows on the strings, that they may shoot in darkness at
the upright in heart.

<span id="an_11:3">11:3</span> If the foundations are destroyed, what
can the righteous do?

<span id="an_11:4">11:4</span> Yahweh is in his holy temple. Yahweh is
on his throne in heaven. His eyes observe. His eyes examine the children
of men.

<span id="an_11:5">11:5</span> Yahweh examines the righteous, but the
wicked and him who loves violence his soul hates.

<span id="an_11:6">11:6</span> On the wicked he will rain blazing coals;
fire, sulfur, and scorching wind shall be the portion of their cup.

<span id="an_11:7">11:7</span> For Yahweh is righteous. He loves
righteousness. The upright shall see his face. For the Chief Musician;
upon an eight-stringed lyre. A Psalm of David.

<span id="an_12:1">12:1</span> Help, Yahweh; for the godly man ceases.
For the faithful fail from among the children of men.

<span id="an_12:2">12:2</span> Everyone lies to his neighbor. They speak
with flattering lips, and with a double heart.

<span id="an_12:3">12:3</span> May Yahweh cut off all flattering lips,
and the tongue that boasts,

<span id="an_12:4">12:4</span> who have said, "With our tongue we will
prevail. Our lips are our own. Who is lord over us?"

<span id="an_12:5">12:5</span> "Because of the oppression of the weak
and because of the groaning of the needy, I will now arise," says
Yahweh; "I will set him in safety from those who malign him."

<span id="an_12:6">12:6</span> The words of Yahweh are flawless words,
as silver refined in a clay furnace, purified seven times.

<span id="an_12:7">12:7</span> You will keep them, Yahweh. You will
preserve them from this generation forever.

<span id="an_12:8">12:8</span> The wicked walk on every side, when what
is vile is exalted among the sons of men. For the Chief Musician. A
Psalm by David.

<span id="an_13:1">13:1</span> How long, Yahweh? Will you forget me
forever? How long will you hide your face from me?

<span id="an_13:2">13:2</span> How long shall I take counsel in my soul,
having sorrow in my heart every day? How long shall my enemy triumph
over me?

<span id="an_13:3">13:3</span> Behold, and answer me, Yahweh, my God.
Give light to my eyes, lest I sleep in death;

<span id="an_13:4">13:4</span> Lest my enemy say, "I have prevailed
against him;" Lest my adversaries rejoice when I fall.

<span id="an_13:5">13:5</span> But I trust in your loving kindness. My
heart rejoices in your salvation.

<span id="an_13:6">13:6</span> I will sing to Yahweh, because he has
been good to me. For the Chief Musician. By David.

<span id="an_14:1">14:1</span> The fool has said in his heart, "There is
no God." They are corrupt. They have done abominable works. There is
none who does good.

<span id="an_14:2">14:2</span> Yahweh looked down from heaven on the
children of men, to see if there were any who did understand, who did
seek after God.

<span id="an_14:3">14:3</span> They have all gone aside. They have
together become corrupt. There is none who does good, no, not one.

<span id="an_14:4">14:4</span> Have all the workers of iniquity no
knowledge, who eat up my people as they eat bread, and don't call on
Yahweh?

<span id="an_14:5">14:5</span> There they were in great fear, for God is
in the generation of the righteous.

<span id="an_14:6">14:6</span> You frustrate the plan of the poor,
because Yahweh is his refuge.

<span id="an_14:7">14:7</span> Oh that the salvation of Israel would
come out of Zion! When Yahweh restores the fortunes of his people, then
Jacob shall rejoice, and Israel shall be glad. A Psalm by David.

<span id="an_15:1">15:1</span> Yahweh, who shall dwell in your
sanctuary? Who shall live on your holy hill?

<span id="an_15:2">15:2</span> He who walks blamelessly does what is
right, and speaks truth in his heart;

<span id="an_15:3">15:3</span> He who doesn't slander with his tongue,
nor does evil to his friend, nor casts slurs against his fellow man;

<span id="an_15:4">15:4</span> In whose eyes a vile man is despised, but
who honors those who fear Yahweh; he who keeps an oath even when it
hurts, and doesn't change;

<span id="an_15:5">15:5</span> he who doesn't lend out his money for
usury, nor take a bribe against the innocent. He who does these things
shall never be shaken. A Poem by David.

<span id="an_16:1">16:1</span> Preserve me, God, for in you do I take
refuge.

<span id="an_16:2">16:2</span> My soul, you have said to Yahweh, "You
are my Lord. Apart from you I have no good thing."

<span id="an_16:3">16:3</span> As for the saints who are in the earth,
they are the excellent ones in whom is all my delight.

<span id="an_16:4">16:4</span> Their sorrows shall be multiplied who
give gifts to another god. Their drink offerings of blood I will not
offer, nor take their names on my lips.

<span id="an_16:5">16:5</span> Yahweh assigned my portion and my cup.
You made my lot secure.

<span id="an_16:6">16:6</span> The lines have fallen to me in pleasant
places. Yes, I have a good inheritance.

<span id="an_16:7">16:7</span> I will bless Yahweh, who has given me
counsel. Yes, my heart instructs me in the night seasons.

<span id="an_16:8">16:8</span> I have set Yahweh always before me.
Because he is at my right hand, I shall not be moved.

<span id="an_16:9">16:9</span> Therefore my heart is glad, and my tongue
rejoices. My body shall also dwell in safety.

<span id="an_16:10">16:10</span> For you will not leave my soul in
Sheol, neither will you allow your holy one to see corruption.

<span id="an_16:11">16:11</span> You will show me the path of life. In
your presence is fullness of joy. In your right hand there are pleasures
forevermore. A Prayer by David.

<span id="an_17:1">17:1</span> Hear, Yahweh, my righteous plea; Give ear
to my prayer, that doesn't go out of deceitful lips.

<span id="an_17:2">17:2</span> Let my sentence come forth from your
presence. Let your eyes look on equity.

<span id="an_17:3">17:3</span> You have proved my heart. You have
visited me in the night. You have tried me, and found nothing. I have
resolved that my mouth shall not disobey.

<span id="an_17:4">17:4</span> As for the works of men, by the word of
your lips, I have kept myself from the ways of the violent.

<span id="an_17:5">17:5</span> My steps have held fast to your paths. My
feet have not slipped.

<span id="an_17:6">17:6</span> I have called on you, for you will answer
me, God. Turn your ear to me. Hear my speech.

<span id="an_17:7">17:7</span> Show your marvelous loving kindness, you
who save those who take refuge by your right hand from their enemies.

<span id="an_17:8">17:8</span> Keep me as the apple of your eye. Hide me
under the shadow of your wings,

<span id="an_17:9">17:9</span> from the wicked who oppress me, my deadly
enemies, who surround me.

<span id="an_17:10">17:10</span> They close up their callous hearts.
With their mouth they speak proudly.

<span id="an_17:11">17:11</span> They have now surrounded us in our
steps. They set their eyes to cast us down to the earth.

<span id="an_17:12">17:12</span> He is like a lion that is greedy of his
prey, as it were a young lion lurking in secret places.

<span id="an_17:13">17:13</span> Arise, Yahweh, confront him. Cast him
down. Deliver my soul from the wicked by your sword;

<span id="an_17:14">17:14</span> from men by your hand, Yahweh, from men
of the world, whose portion is in this life. You fill the belly of your
cherished ones. Your sons have plenty, and they store up wealth for
their children.

<span id="an_17:15">17:15</span> As for me, I shall see your face in
righteousness. I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with seeing your
form. For the Chief Musician. By David the servant of Yahweh, who spoke
to Yahweh the words of this song in the day that Yahweh delivered him
from the hand of all his enemies, and from the hand of Saul. He said,

<span id="an_18:1">18:1</span> I love you, Yahweh, my strength.

<span id="an_18:2">18:2</span> Yahweh is my rock, my fortress, and my
deliverer; my God, my rock, in whom I take refuge; my shield, and the
horn of my salvation, my high tower.

<span id="an_18:3">18:3</span> I call on Yahweh, who is worthy to be
praised; and I am saved from my enemies.

<span id="an_18:4">18:4</span> The cords of death surrounded me. The
floods of ungodliness made me afraid.

<span id="an_18:5">18:5</span> The cords of Sheol were around me. The
snares of death came on me.

<span id="an_18:6">18:6</span> In my distress I called on Yahweh, and
cried to my God. He heard my voice out of his temple. My cry before him
came into his ears.

<span id="an_18:7">18:7</span> Then the earth shook and trembled. The
foundations also of the mountains quaked and were shaken, because he was
angry.

<span id="an_18:8">18:8</span> Smoke went out of his nostrils. Consuming
fire came out of his mouth. Coals were kindled by it.

<span id="an_18:9">18:9</span> He bowed the heavens also, and came down.
Thick darkness was under his feet.

<span id="an_18:10">18:10</span> He rode on a cherub, and flew. Yes, he
soared on the wings of the wind.

<span id="an_18:11">18:11</span> He made darkness his hiding place, his
pavilion around him, darkness of waters, thick clouds of the skies.

<span id="an_18:12">18:12</span> At the brightness before him his thick
clouds passed, hailstones and coals of fire.

<span id="an_18:13">18:13</span> Yahweh also thundered in the sky. The
Most High uttered his voice: hailstones and coals of fire.

<span id="an_18:14">18:14</span> He sent out his arrows, and scattered
them; Yes, great lightning bolts, and routed them.

<span id="an_18:15">18:15</span> Then the channels of waters appeared.
The foundations of the world were laid bare at your rebuke, Yahweh, at
the blast of the breath of your nostrils.

<span id="an_18:16">18:16</span> He sent from on high. He took me. He
drew me out of many waters.

<span id="an_18:17">18:17</span> He delivered me from my strong enemy,
from those who hated me; for they were too mighty for me.

<span id="an_18:18">18:18</span> They came on me in the day of my
calamity, but Yahweh was my support.

<span id="an_18:19">18:19</span> He brought me forth also into a large
place. He delivered me, because he delighted in me.

<span id="an_18:20">18:20</span> Yahweh has rewarded me according to my
righteousness. According to the cleanness of my hands has he recompensed
me.

<span id="an_18:21">18:21</span> For I have kept the ways of Yahweh, and
have not wickedly departed from my God.

<span id="an_18:22">18:22</span> For all his ordinances were before me.
I didn't put away his statutes from me.

<span id="an_18:23">18:23</span> I was also blameless with him. I kept
myself from my iniquity.

<span id="an_18:24">18:24</span> Therefore Yahweh has rewarded me
according to my righteousness, according to the cleanness of my hands in
his eyesight.

<span id="an_18:25">18:25</span> With the merciful you will show
yourself merciful. With the perfect man, you will show yourself perfect.

<span id="an_18:26">18:26</span> With the pure, you will show yourself
pure. With the crooked you will show yourself shrewd.

<span id="an_18:27">18:27</span> For you will save the afflicted people,
but the haughty eyes you will bring down.

<span id="an_18:28">18:28</span> For you will light my lamp, Yahweh. My
God will light up my darkness.

<span id="an_18:29">18:29</span> For by you, I advance through a troop.
By my God, I leap over a wall.

<span id="an_18:30">18:30</span> As for God, his way is perfect. The
word of Yahweh is tried. He is a shield to all those who take refuge in
him.

<span id="an_18:31">18:31</span> For who is God, except Yahweh? Who is a
rock, besides our God,

<span id="an_18:32">18:32</span> the God who arms me with strength, and
makes my way perfect?

<span id="an_18:33">18:33</span> He makes my feet like deer's feet, and
sets me on my high places.

<span id="an_18:34">18:34</span> He teaches my hands to war, so that my
arms bend a bow of bronze.

<span id="an_18:35">18:35</span> You have also given me the shield of
your salvation. Your right hand sustains me. Your gentleness has made me
great.

<span id="an_18:36">18:36</span> You have enlarged my steps under me, My
feet have not slipped.

<span id="an_18:37">18:37</span> I will pursue my enemies, and overtake
them. Neither will I turn again until they are consumed.

<span id="an_18:38">18:38</span> I will strike them through, so that
they will not be able to rise. They shall fall under my feet.

<span id="an_18:39">18:39</span> For you have armed me with strength to
the battle. You have subdued under me those who rose up against me.

<span id="an_18:40">18:40</span> You have also made my enemies turn
their backs to me, that I might cut off those who hate me.

<span id="an_18:41">18:41</span> They cried, but there was none to save;
even to Yahweh, but he didn't answer them.

<span id="an_18:42">18:42</span> Then I beat them small as the dust
before the wind. I cast them out as the mire of the streets.

<span id="an_18:43">18:43</span> You have delivered me from the
strivings of the people. You have made me the head of the nations. A
people whom I have not known shall serve me.

<span id="an_18:44">18:44</span> As soon as they hear of me they shall
obey me. The foreigners shall submit themselves to me.

<span id="an_18:45">18:45</span> The foreigners shall fade away, and
shall come trembling out of their close places.

<span id="an_18:46">18:46</span> Yahweh lives; and blessed be my rock.
Exalted be the God of my salvation,

<span id="an_18:47">18:47</span> even the God who executes vengeance for
me, and subdues peoples under me.

<span id="an_18:48">18:48</span> He rescues me from my enemies. Yes, you
lift me up above those who rise up against me. You deliver me from the
violent man.

<span id="an_18:49">18:49</span> Therefore I will give thanks to you,
Yahweh, among the nations, and will sing praises to your name.

<span id="an_18:50">18:50</span> He gives great deliverance to his king,
and shows loving kindness to his anointed, to David and to his seed,
forevermore. For the Chief Musician. A Psalm by David.

<span id="an_19:1">19:1</span> The heavens declare the glory of God. The
expanse shows his handiwork.

<span id="an_19:2">19:2</span> Day after day they pour forth speech, and
night after night they display knowledge.

<span id="an_19:3">19:3</span> There is no speech nor language, where
their voice is not heard.

<span id="an_19:4">19:4</span> Their voice has gone out through all the
earth, their words to the end of the world. In them he has set a tent
for the sun,

<span id="an_19:5">19:5</span> which is as a bridegroom coming out of
his room, like a strong man rejoicing to run his course.

<span id="an_19:6">19:6</span> His going forth is from the end of the
heavens, his circuit to its ends; There is nothing hidden from its heat.

<span id="an_19:7">19:7</span> Yahweh's law is perfect, restoring the
soul. Yahweh's testimony is sure, making wise the simple.

<span id="an_19:8">19:8</span> Yahweh's precepts are right, rejoicing
the heart. Yahweh's commandment is pure, enlightening the eyes.

<span id="an_19:9">19:9</span> The fear of Yahweh is clean, enduring
forever. Yahweh's ordinances are true, and righteous altogether.

<span id="an_19:10">19:10</span> More to be desired are they than gold,
yes, than much fine gold; sweeter also than honey and the extract of the
honeycomb.

<span id="an_19:11">19:11</span> Moreover by them is your servant
warned. In keeping them there is great reward.

<span id="an_19:12">19:12</span> Who can discern his errors? Forgive me
from hidden errors.

<span id="an_19:13">19:13</span> Keep back your servant also from
presumptuous sins. Let them not have dominion over me. Then I will be
upright. I will be blameless and innocent of great transgression.

<span id="an_19:14">19:14</span> Let the words of my mouth and the
meditation of my heart be acceptable in your sight, Yahweh, my rock, and
my redeemer. For the Chief Musician. A Psalm by David.

<span id="an_20:1">20:1</span> May Yahweh answer you in the day of
trouble. May the name of the God of Jacob set you up on high,

<span id="an_20:2">20:2</span> send you help from the sanctuary, grant
you support from Zion,

<span id="an_20:3">20:3</span> remember all your offerings, and accept
your burnt sacrifice. Selah.

<span id="an_20:4">20:4</span> May He grant you your heart's desire, and
fulfill all your counsel.

<span id="an_20:5">20:5</span> We will triumph in your salvation. In the
name of our God, we will set up our banners. May Yahweh grant all your
requests.

<span id="an_20:6">20:6</span> Now I know that Yahweh saves his
anointed. He will answer him from his holy heaven, with the saving
strength of his right hand.

<span id="an_20:7">20:7</span> Some trust in chariots, and some in
horses, but we trust the name of Yahweh our God.

<span id="an_20:8">20:8</span> They are bowed down and fallen, but we
rise up, and stand upright.

<span id="an_20:9">20:9</span> Save, Yahweh! Let the King answer us when
we call! For the Chief Musician. A Psalm by David.

<span id="an_21:1">21:1</span> The king rejoices in your strength,
Yahweh! How greatly he rejoices in your salvation!

<span id="an_21:2">21:2</span> You have given him his heart's desire,
and have not withheld the request of his lips. Selah.

<span id="an_21:3">21:3</span> For you meet him with the blessings of
goodness. You set a crown of fine gold on his head.

<span id="an_21:4">21:4</span> He asked life of you, you gave it to him,
even length of days forever and ever.

<span id="an_21:5">21:5</span> His glory is great in your salvation. You
lay honor and majesty on him.

<span id="an_21:6">21:6</span> For you make him most blessed forever.
You make him glad with joy in your presence.

<span id="an_21:7">21:7</span> For the king trusts in Yahweh. Through
the loving kindness of the Most High, he shall not be moved.

<span id="an_21:8">21:8</span> Your hand will find out all of your
enemies. Your right hand will find out those who hate you.

<span id="an_21:9">21:9</span> You will make them as a fiery furnace in
the time of your anger. Yahweh will swallow them up in his wrath. The
fire shall devour them.

<span id="an_21:10">21:10</span> You will destroy their descendants from
the earth, their posterity from among the children of men.

<span id="an_21:11">21:11</span> For they intended evil against you.
They plotted evil against you which cannot succeed.

<span id="an_21:12">21:12</span> For you will make them turn their back,
when you aim drawn bows at their face.

<span id="an_21:13">21:13</span> Be exalted, Yahweh, in your strength,
so we will sing and praise your power. For the Chief Musician; set to
"The Doe of the Morning." A Psalm by David.

<span id="an_22:1">22:1</span> My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?
Why are you so far from helping me, and from the words of my groaning?

<span id="an_22:2">22:2</span> My God, I cry in the daytime, but you
don't answer; in the night season, and am not silent.

<span id="an_22:3">22:3</span> But you are holy, you who inhabit the
praises of Israel.

<span id="an_22:4">22:4</span> Our fathers trusted in you. They trusted,
and you delivered them.

<span id="an_22:5">22:5</span> They cried to you, and were delivered.
They trusted in you, and were not disappointed.

<span id="an_22:6">22:6</span> But I am a worm, and no man; a reproach
of men, and despised by the people.

<span id="an_22:7">22:7</span> All those who see me mock me. They insult
me with their lips. They shake their heads, saying,

<span id="an_22:8">22:8</span> "He trusts in Yahweh; let him deliver
him. Let him rescue him, since he delights in him."

<span id="an_22:9">22:9</span> But you brought me out of the womb. You
made me trust at my mother's breasts.

<span id="an_22:10">22:10</span> I was thrown on you from my mother's
womb. You are my God since my mother bore me.

<span id="an_22:11">22:11</span> Don't be far from me, for trouble is
near. For there is none to help.

<span id="an_22:12">22:12</span> Many bulls have surrounded me. Strong
bulls of Bashan have encircled me.

<span id="an_22:13">22:13</span> They open their mouths wide against me,
lions tearing prey and roaring.

<span id="an_22:14">22:14</span> I am poured out like water. All my
bones are out of joint. My heart is like wax; it is melted within me.

<span id="an_22:15">22:15</span> My strength is dried up like a
potsherd. My tongue sticks to the roof of my mouth. You have brought me
into the dust of death.

<span id="an_22:16">22:16</span> For dogs have surrounded me. A company
of evildoers have enclosed me. They have pierced my hands and feet.

<span id="an_22:17">22:17</span> I can count all of my bones. They look
and stare at me.

<span id="an_22:18">22:18</span> They divide my garments among them.
They cast lots for my clothing.

<span id="an_22:19">22:19</span> But don't be far off, Yahweh. You are
my help: hurry to help me.

<span id="an_22:20">22:20</span> Deliver my soul from the sword, my
precious life from the power of the dog.

<span id="an_22:21">22:21</span> Save me from the lion's mouth! Yes,
from the horns of the wild oxen, you have answered me.

<span id="an_22:22">22:22</span> I will declare your name to my
brothers. In the midst of the assembly, I will praise you.

<span id="an_22:23">22:23</span> You who fear Yahweh, praise him! All
you descendants of Jacob, glorify him! Stand in awe of him, all you
descendants of Israel!

<span id="an_22:24">22:24</span> For he has not despised nor abhorred
the affliction of the afflicted, Neither has he hidden his face from
him; but when he cried to him, he heard.

<span id="an_22:25">22:25</span> Of you comes my praise in the great
assembly. I will pay my vows before those who fear him.

<span id="an_22:26">22:26</span> The humble shall eat and be satisfied.
They shall praise Yahweh who seek after him. Let your hearts live
forever.

<span id="an_22:27">22:27</span> All the ends of the earth shall
remember and turn to Yahweh. All the relatives of the nations shall
worship before you.

<span id="an_22:28">22:28</span> For the kingdom is Yahweh's. He is the
ruler over the nations.

<span id="an_22:29">22:29</span> All the rich ones of the earth shall
eat and worship. All those who go down to the dust shall bow before him,
even he who can't keep his soul alive.

<span id="an_22:30">22:30</span> Posterity shall serve him. Future
generations shall be told about the Lord.

<span id="an_22:31">22:31</span> They shall come and shall declare his
righteousness to a people that shall be born, for he has done it. A
Psalm by David.

<span id="an_23:1">23:1</span> Yahweh is my shepherd: I shall lack
nothing.

<span id="an_23:2">23:2</span> He makes me lie down in green pastures.
He leads me beside still waters.

<span id="an_23:3">23:3</span> He restores my soul. He guides me in the
paths of righteousness for his name's sake.

<span id="an_23:4">23:4</span> Even though I walk through the valley of
the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for you are with me. Your rod
and your staff, they comfort me.

<span id="an_23:5">23:5</span> You prepare a table before me in the
presence of my enemies. You anoint my head with oil. My cup runs over.

<span id="an_23:6">23:6</span> Surely goodness and loving kindness shall
follow me all the days of my life, and I will dwell in Yahweh's house
forever. A Psalm by David.

<span id="an_24:1">24:1</span> The earth is Yahweh's, with its fullness;
the world, and those who dwell therein.

<span id="an_24:2">24:2</span> For he has founded it on the seas, and
established it on the floods.

<span id="an_24:3">24:3</span> Who may ascend to Yahweh's hill? Who may
stand in his holy place?

<span id="an_24:4">24:4</span> He who has clean hands and a pure heart;
who has not lifted up his soul to falsehood, and has not sworn
deceitfully.

<span id="an_24:5">24:5</span> He shall receive a blessing from Yahweh,
righteousness from the God of his salvation.

<span id="an_24:6">24:6</span> This is the generation of those who seek
Him, who seek your face--even Jacob. Selah.

<span id="an_24:7">24:7</span> Lift up your heads, you gates! Be lifted
up, you everlasting doors, and the King of glory will come in.

<span id="an_24:8">24:8</span> Who is the King of glory? Yahweh strong
and mighty, Yahweh mighty in battle.

<span id="an_24:9">24:9</span> Lift up your heads, you gates; yes, lift
them up, you everlasting doors, and the King of glory will come in.

<span id="an_24:10">24:10</span> Who is this King of glory? Yahweh of
Armies is the King of glory! Selah. By David.

<span id="an_25:1">25:1</span> To you, Yahweh, do I lift up my soul.

<span id="an_25:2">25:2</span> My God, I have trusted in you. Don't let
me be shamed. Don't let my enemies triumph over me.

<span id="an_25:3">25:3</span> Yes, no one who waits for you shall be
shamed. They shall be shamed who deal treacherously without cause.

<span id="an_25:4">25:4</span> Show me your ways, Yahweh. Teach me your
paths.

<span id="an_25:5">25:5</span> Guide me in your truth, and teach me, For
you are the God of my salvation, I wait for you all day long.

<span id="an_25:6">25:6</span> Yahweh, remember your tender mercies and
your loving kindness, for they are from old times.

<span id="an_25:7">25:7</span> Don't remember the sins of my youth, nor
my transgressions. Remember me according to your loving kindness, for
your goodness' sake, Yahweh.

<span id="an_25:8">25:8</span> Good and upright is Yahweh, therefore he
will instruct sinners in the way.

<span id="an_25:9">25:9</span> He will guide the humble in justice. He
will teach the humble his way.

<span id="an_25:10">25:10</span> All the paths of Yahweh are loving
kindness and truth to such as keep his covenant and his testimonies.

<span id="an_25:11">25:11</span> For your name's sake, Yahweh, pardon my
iniquity, for it is great.

<span id="an_25:12">25:12</span> What man is he who fears Yahweh? He
shall instruct him in the way that he shall choose.

<span id="an_25:13">25:13</span> His soul shall dwell at ease. His seed
shall inherit the land.

<span id="an_25:14">25:14</span> The friendship of Yahweh is with those
who fear him. He will show them his covenant.

<span id="an_25:15">25:15</span> My eyes are ever on Yahweh, for he will
pluck my feet out of the net.

<span id="an_25:16">25:16</span> Turn to me, and have mercy on me, for I
am desolate and afflicted.

<span id="an_25:17">25:17</span> The troubles of my heart are enlarged.
Oh bring me out of my distresses.

<span id="an_25:18">25:18</span> Consider my affliction and my travail.
Forgive all my sins.

<span id="an_25:19">25:19</span> Consider my enemies, for they are many.
They hate me with cruel hatred.

<span id="an_25:20">25:20</span> Oh keep my soul, and deliver me. Let me
not be disappointed, for I take refuge in you.

<span id="an_25:21">25:21</span> Let integrity and uprightness preserve
me, for I wait for you.

<span id="an_25:22">25:22</span> Redeem Israel, God, out all of his
troubles. By David.

<span id="an_26:1">26:1</span> Judge me, Yahweh, for I have walked in my
integrity. I have trusted also in Yahweh without wavering.

<span id="an_26:2">26:2</span> Examine me, Yahweh, and prove me. Try my
heart and my mind.

<span id="an_26:3">26:3</span> For your loving kindness is before my
eyes. I have walked in your truth.

<span id="an_26:4">26:4</span> I have not sat with deceitful men,
neither will I go in with hypocrites.

<span id="an_26:5">26:5</span> I hate the assembly of evildoers, and
will not sit with the wicked.

<span id="an_26:6">26:6</span> I will wash my hands in innocence, so I
will go about your altar, Yahweh;

<span id="an_26:7">26:7</span> that I may make the voice of thanksgiving
to be heard, and tell of all your wondrous works.

<span id="an_26:8">26:8</span> Yahweh, I love the habitation of your
house, the place where your glory dwells.

<span id="an_26:9">26:9</span> Don't gather my soul with sinners, nor my
life with bloodthirsty men;

<span id="an_26:10">26:10</span> in whose hands is wickedness, their
right hand is full of bribes.

<span id="an_26:11">26:11</span> But as for me, I will walk in my
integrity. Redeem me, and be merciful to me.

<span id="an_26:12">26:12</span> My foot stands in an even place. In the
congregations I will bless Yahweh. By David.

<span id="an_27:1">27:1</span> Yahweh is my light and my salvation. Whom
shall I fear? Yahweh is the strength of my life. Of whom shall I be
afraid?

<span id="an_27:2">27:2</span> When evildoers came at me to eat up my
flesh, even my adversaries and my foes, they stumbled and fell.

<span id="an_27:3">27:3</span> Though an army should encamp against me,
my heart shall not fear. Though war should rise against me, even then I
will be confident.

<span id="an_27:4">27:4</span> One thing I have asked of Yahweh, that I
will seek after, that I may dwell in the house of Yahweh all the days of
my life, to see Yahweh's beauty, and to inquire in his temple.

<span id="an_27:5">27:5</span> For in the day of trouble he will keep me
secretly in his pavilion. In the covert of his tabernacle he will hide
me. He will lift me up on a rock.

<span id="an_27:6">27:6</span> Now my head will be lifted up above my
enemies around me. I will offer sacrifices of joy in his tent. I will
sing, yes, I will sing praises to Yahweh.

<span id="an_27:7">27:7</span> Hear, Yahweh, when I cry with my voice.
Have mercy also on me, and answer me.

<span id="an_27:8">27:8</span> When you said, "Seek my face," my heart
said to you, "I will seek your face, Yahweh."

<span id="an_27:9">27:9</span> Don't hide your face from me. Don't put
your servant away in anger. You have been my help. Don't abandon me,
neither forsake me, God of my salvation.

<span id="an_27:10">27:10</span> When my father and my mother forsake
me, then Yahweh will take me up.

<span id="an_27:11">27:11</span> Teach me your way, Yahweh. Lead me in a
straight path, because of my enemies.

<span id="an_27:12">27:12</span> Don't deliver me over to the desire of
my adversaries, for false witnesses have risen up against me, such as
breathe out cruelty.

<span id="an_27:13">27:13</span> I am still confident of this: I will
see the goodness of Yahweh in the land of the living.

<span id="an_27:14">27:14</span> Wait for Yahweh. Be strong, and let
your heart take courage. Yes, wait for Yahweh. By David.

<span id="an_28:1">28:1</span> To you, Yahweh, I call. My rock, don't be
deaf to me; lest, if you are silent to me, I would become like those who
go down into the pit.

<span id="an_28:2">28:2</span> Hear the voice of my petitions, when I
cry to you, when I lift up my hands toward your Most Holy Place.

<span id="an_28:3">28:3</span> Don't draw me away with the wicked, with
the workers of iniquity who speak peace with their neighbors, but
mischief is in their hearts.

<span id="an_28:4">28:4</span> Give them according to their work, and
according to the wickedness of their doings. Give them according to the
operation of their hands. Bring back on them what they deserve.

<span id="an_28:5">28:5</span> Because they don't respect the works of
Yahweh, nor the operation of his hands, he will break them down and not
build them up.

<span id="an_28:6">28:6</span> Blessed be Yahweh, because he has heard
the voice of my petitions.

<span id="an_28:7">28:7</span> Yahweh is my strength and my shield. My
heart has trusted in him, and I am helped. Therefore my heart greatly
rejoices. With my song I will thank him.

<span id="an_28:8">28:8</span> Yahweh is their strength. He is a
stronghold of salvation to his anointed.

<span id="an_28:9">28:9</span> Save your people, and bless your
inheritance. Be their shepherd also, and bear them up forever. A Psalm
by David.

<span id="an_29:1">29:1</span> Ascribe to Yahweh, you sons of the
mighty, ascribe to Yahweh glory and strength.

<span id="an_29:2">29:2</span> Ascribe to Yahweh the glory due to his
name. Worship Yahweh in holy array.

<span id="an_29:3">29:3</span> Yahweh's voice is on the waters. The God
of glory thunders, even Yahweh on many waters.

<span id="an_29:4">29:4</span> Yahweh's voice is powerful. Yahweh's
voice is full of majesty.

<span id="an_29:5">29:5</span> The voice of Yahweh breaks the cedars.
Yes, Yahweh breaks in pieces the cedars of Lebanon.

<span id="an_29:6">29:6</span> He makes them also to skip like a calf;
Lebanon and Sirion like a young, wild ox.

<span id="an_29:7">29:7</span> Yahweh's voice strikes with flashes of
lightning.

<span id="an_29:8">29:8</span> Yahweh's voice shakes the wilderness.
Yahweh shakes the wilderness of Kadesh.

<span id="an_29:9">29:9</span> Yahweh's voice makes the deer calve, and
strips the forests bare. In his temple everything says, "Glory!"

<span id="an_29:10">29:10</span> Yahweh sat enthroned at the Flood. Yes,
Yahweh sits as King forever.

<span id="an_29:11">29:11</span> Yahweh will give strength to his
people. Yahweh will bless his people with peace. A Psalm. A Song for the
Dedication of the Temple. By David.

<span id="an_30:1">30:1</span> I will extol you, Yahweh, for you have
raised me up, and have not made my foes to rejoice over me.

<span id="an_30:2">30:2</span> Yahweh my God, I cried to you, and you
have healed me.

<span id="an_30:3">30:3</span> Yahweh, you have brought up my soul from
Sheol. You have kept me alive, that I should not go down to the pit.

<span id="an_30:4">30:4</span> Sing praise to Yahweh, you saints of his.
Give thanks to his holy name.

<span id="an_30:5">30:5</span> For his anger is but for a moment. His
favor is for a lifetime. Weeping may stay for the night, but joy comes
in the morning.

<span id="an_30:6">30:6</span> As for me, I said in my prosperity, "I
shall never be moved."

<span id="an_30:7">30:7</span> You, Yahweh, when you favored me, made my
mountain stand strong; but when you hid your face, I was troubled.

<span id="an_30:8">30:8</span> I cried to you, Yahweh. To Yahweh I made
supplication:

<span id="an_30:9">30:9</span> "What profit is there in my destruction,
if I go down to the pit? Shall the dust praise you? Shall it declare
your truth?

<span id="an_30:10">30:10</span> Hear, Yahweh, and have mercy on me.
Yahweh, be my helper."

<span id="an_30:11">30:11</span> You have turned my mourning into
dancing for me. You have removed my sackcloth, and clothed me with
gladness,

<span id="an_30:12">30:12</span> To the end that my heart may sing
praise to you, and not be silent. Yahweh my God, I will give thanks to
you forever! For the Chief Musician. A Psalm by David.

<span id="an_31:1">31:1</span> In you, Yahweh, I take refuge. Let me
never be disappointed. Deliver me in your righteousness.

<span id="an_31:2">31:2</span> Bow down your ear to me. Deliver me
speedily. Be to me a strong rock, a house of defense to save me.

<span id="an_31:3">31:3</span> For you are my rock and my fortress,
therefore for your name's sake lead me and guide me.

<span id="an_31:4">31:4</span> Pluck me out of the net that they have
laid secretly for me, for you are my stronghold.

<span id="an_31:5">31:5</span> Into your hand I commend my spirit. You
redeem me, Yahweh, God of truth.

<span id="an_31:6">31:6</span> I hate those who regard lying vanities,
but I trust in Yahweh.

<span id="an_31:7">31:7</span> I will be glad and rejoice in your loving
kindness, for you have seen my affliction. You have known my soul in
adversities.

<span id="an_31:8">31:8</span> You have not shut me up into the hand of
the enemy. You have set my feet in a large place.

<span id="an_31:9">31:9</span> Have mercy on me, Yahweh, for I am in
distress. My eye, my soul, and my body waste away with grief.

<span id="an_31:10">31:10</span> For my life is spent with sorrow, my
years with sighing. My strength fails because of my iniquity. My bones
are wasted away.

<span id="an_31:11">31:11</span> Because of all my adversaries I have
become utterly contemptible to my neighbors, A fear to my acquaintances.
Those who saw me on the street fled from me.

<span id="an_31:12">31:12</span> I am forgotten from their hearts like a
dead man. I am like broken pottery.

<span id="an_31:13">31:13</span> For I have heard the slander of many,
terror on every side, while they conspire together against me, they plot
to take away my life.

<span id="an_31:14">31:14</span> But I trust in you, Yahweh. I said,
"You are my God."

<span id="an_31:15">31:15</span> My times are in your hand. Deliver me
from the hand of my enemies, and from those who persecute me.

<span id="an_31:16">31:16</span> Make your face to shine on your
servant. Save me in your loving kindness.

<span id="an_31:17">31:17</span> Let me not be disappointed, Yahweh, for
I have called on you. Let the wicked be disappointed. Let them be silent
in Sheol.

<span id="an_31:18">31:18</span> Let the lying lips be mute, which speak
against the righteous insolently, with pride and contempt.

<span id="an_31:19">31:19</span> Oh how great is your goodness, which
you have laid up for those who fear you, which you have worked for those
who take refuge in you, before the sons of men!

<span id="an_31:20">31:20</span> In the shelter of your presence you
will hide them from the plotting of man. You will keep them secretly in
a dwelling away from the strife of tongues.

<span id="an_31:21">31:21</span> Praise be to Yahweh, for he has shown
me his marvelous loving kindness in a strong city.

<span id="an_31:22">31:22</span> As for me, I said in my haste, "I am
cut off from before your eyes." Nevertheless you heard the voice of my
petitions when I cried to you.

<span id="an_31:23">31:23</span> Oh love Yahweh, all you his saints!
Yahweh preserves the faithful, and fully recompenses him who behaves
arrogantly.

<span id="an_31:24">31:24</span> Be strong, and let your heart take
courage, all you who hope in Yahweh. By David. A contemplative psalm.

<span id="an_32:1">32:1</span> Blessed is he whose disobedience is
forgiven, whose sin is covered.

<span id="an_32:2">32:2</span> Blessed is the man to whom Yahweh doesn't
impute iniquity, in whose spirit there is no deceit.

<span id="an_32:3">32:3</span> When I kept silence, my bones wasted away
through my groaning all day long.

<span id="an_32:4">32:4</span> For day and night your hand was heavy on
me. My strength was sapped in the heat of summer. Selah.

<span id="an_32:5">32:5</span> I acknowledged my sin to you. I didn't
hide my iniquity. I said, I will confess my transgressions to Yahweh,
and you forgave the iniquity of my sin. Selah.

<span id="an_32:6">32:6</span> For this, let everyone who is godly pray
to you in a time when you may be found. Surely when the great waters
overflow, they shall not reach to him.

<span id="an_32:7">32:7</span> You are my hiding place. You will
preserve me from trouble. You will surround me with songs of
deliverance. Selah.

<span id="an_32:8">32:8</span> I will instruct you and teach you in the
way which you shall go. I will counsel you with my eye on you.

<span id="an_32:9">32:9</span> Don't be like the horse, or like the
mule, which have no understanding, who are controlled by bit and bridle,
or else they will not come near to you.

<span id="an_32:10">32:10</span> Many sorrows come to the wicked, but
loving kindness shall surround him who trusts in Yahweh.

<span id="an_32:11">32:11</span> Be glad in Yahweh, and rejoice, you
righteous! Shout for joy, all you who are upright in heart!

<span id="an_33:1">33:1</span> Rejoice in Yahweh, you righteous! Praise
is fitting for the upright.

<span id="an_33:2">33:2</span> Give thanks to Yahweh with the lyre. Sing
praises to him with the harp of ten strings.

<span id="an_33:3">33:3</span> Sing to him a new song. Play skillfully
with a shout of joy!

<span id="an_33:4">33:4</span> For the word of Yahweh is right. All his
work is done in faithfulness.

<span id="an_33:5">33:5</span> He loves righteousness and justice. The
earth is full of the loving kindness of Yahweh.

<span id="an_33:6">33:6</span> By Yahweh's word, the heavens were made;
all their army by the breath of his mouth.

<span id="an_33:7">33:7</span> He gathers the waters of the sea together
as a heap. He lays up the deeps in storehouses.

<span id="an_33:8">33:8</span> Let all the earth fear Yahweh. Let all
the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of him.

<span id="an_33:9">33:9</span> For he spoke, and it was done. He
commanded, and it stood firm.

<span id="an_33:10">33:10</span> Yahweh brings the counsel of the
nations to nothing. He makes the thoughts of the peoples to be of no
effect.

<span id="an_33:11">33:11</span> The counsel of Yahweh stands fast
forever, the thoughts of his heart to all generations.

<span id="an_33:12">33:12</span> Blessed is the nation whose God is
Yahweh, the people whom he has chosen for his own inheritance.

<span id="an_33:13">33:13</span> Yahweh looks from heaven. He sees all
the sons of men.

<span id="an_33:14">33:14</span> From the place of his habitation he
looks out on all the inhabitants of the earth,

<span id="an_33:15">33:15</span> he who fashions all of their hearts;
and he considers all of their works.

<span id="an_33:16">33:16</span> There is no king saved by the multitude
of an army. A mighty man is not delivered by great strength.

<span id="an_33:17">33:17</span> A horse is a vain thing for safety,
neither does he deliver any by his great power.

<span id="an_33:18">33:18</span> Behold, Yahweh's eye is on those who
fear him, on those who hope in his loving kindness;

<span id="an_33:19">33:19</span> to deliver their soul from death, to
keep them alive in famine.

<span id="an_33:20">33:20</span> Our soul has waited for Yahweh. He is
our help and our shield.

<span id="an_33:21">33:21</span> For our heart rejoices in him, because
we have trusted in his holy name.

<span id="an_33:22">33:22</span> Let your loving kindness be on us,
Yahweh, since we have hoped in you. By David; when he pretended to be
insane before Abimelech, who drove him away, and he departed.

<span id="an_34:1">34:1</span> I will bless Yahweh at all times. His
praise will always be in my mouth.

<span id="an_34:2">34:2</span> My soul shall boast in Yahweh. The humble
shall hear of it, and be glad.

<span id="an_34:3">34:3</span> Oh magnify Yahweh with me. Let us exalt
his name together.

<span id="an_34:4">34:4</span> I sought Yahweh, and he answered me, and
delivered me from all my fears.

<span id="an_34:5">34:5</span> They looked to him, and were radiant.
Their faces shall never be covered with shame.

<span id="an_34:6">34:6</span> This poor man cried, and Yahweh heard
him, and saved him out of all his troubles.

<span id="an_34:7">34:7</span> The angel of Yahweh encamps around those
who fear him, and delivers them.

<span id="an_34:8">34:8</span> Oh taste and see that Yahweh is good.
Blessed is the man who takes refuge in him.

<span id="an_34:9">34:9</span> Oh fear Yahweh, you his saints, for there
is no lack with those who fear him.

<span id="an_34:10">34:10</span> The young lions do lack, and suffer
hunger, but those who seek Yahweh shall not lack any good thing.

<span id="an_34:11">34:11</span> Come, you children, listen to me. I
will teach you the fear of Yahweh.

<span id="an_34:12">34:12</span> Who is someone who desires life, and
loves many days, that he may see good?

<span id="an_34:13">34:13</span> Keep your tongue from evil, and your
lips from speaking lies.

<span id="an_34:14">34:14</span> Depart from evil, and do good. seek
peace, and pursue it.

<span id="an_34:15">34:15</span> Yahweh's eyes are toward the righteous.
His ears listen to their cry.

<span id="an_34:16">34:16</span> Yahweh's face is against those who do
evil, to cut off the memory of them from the earth.

<span id="an_34:17">34:17</span> The righteous cry, and Yahweh hears,
and delivers them out of all their troubles.

<span id="an_34:18">34:18</span> Yahweh is near to those who have a
broken heart, and saves those who have a crushed spirit.

<span id="an_34:19">34:19</span> Many are the afflictions of the
righteous, but Yahweh delivers him out of them all.

<span id="an_34:20">34:20</span> He protects all of his bones. Not one
of them is broken.

<span id="an_34:21">34:21</span> Evil shall kill the wicked. Those who
hate the righteous shall be condemned.

<span id="an_34:22">34:22</span> Yahweh redeems the soul of his
servants. None of those who take refuge in him shall be condemned. By
David.

<span id="an_35:1">35:1</span> Contend, Yahweh, with those who contend
with me. Fight against those who fight against me.

<span id="an_35:2">35:2</span> Take hold of shield and buckler, and
stand up for my help.

<span id="an_35:3">35:3</span> Brandish the spear and block those who
pursue me. Tell my soul, "I am your salvation."

<span id="an_35:4">35:4</span> Let those who seek after my soul be
disappointed and brought to dishonor. Let those who plot my ruin be
turned back and confounded.

<span id="an_35:5">35:5</span> Let them be as chaff before the wind,
Yahweh's angel driving them on.

<span id="an_35:6">35:6</span> Let their way be dark and slippery,
Yahweh's angel pursuing them.

<span id="an_35:7">35:7</span> For without cause they have hidden their
net in a pit for me. Without cause they have dug a pit for my soul.

<span id="an_35:8">35:8</span> Let destruction come on him unawares. Let
his net that he has hidden catch himself. Let him fall into that
destruction.

<span id="an_35:9">35:9</span> My soul shall be joyful in Yahweh. It
shall rejoice in his salvation.

<span id="an_35:10">35:10</span> All my bones shall say, "Yahweh, who is
like you, who delivers the poor from him who is too strong for him; yes,
the poor and the needy from him who robs him?"

<span id="an_35:11">35:11</span> Unrighteous witnesses rise up. They ask
me about things that I don't know about.

<span id="an_35:12">35:12</span> They reward me evil for good, to the
bereaving of my soul.

<span id="an_35:13">35:13</span> But as for me, when they were sick, my
clothing was sackcloth. I afflicted my soul with fasting. My prayer
returned into my own bosom.

<span id="an_35:14">35:14</span> I behaved myself as though it had been
my friend or my brother. I bowed down mourning, as one who mourns his
mother.

<span id="an_35:15">35:15</span> But in my adversity, they rejoiced, and
gathered themselves together. The attackers gathered themselves together
against me, and I didn't know it. They tore at me, and didn't cease.

<span id="an_35:16">35:16</span> Like the profane mockers in feasts,
they gnashed their teeth at me.

<span id="an_35:17">35:17</span> Lord, how long will you look on? Rescue
my soul from their destruction, my precious life from the lions.

<span id="an_35:18">35:18</span> I will give you thanks in the great
assembly. I will praise you among many people.

<span id="an_35:19">35:19</span> Don't let those who are my enemies
wrongfully rejoice over me; neither let those who hate me without a
cause wink their eyes.

<span id="an_35:20">35:20</span> For they don't speak peace, but they
devise deceitful words against those who are quiet in the land.

<span id="an_35:21">35:21</span> Yes, they opened their mouth wide
against me. They said, "Aha! Aha! Our eye has seen it!"

<span id="an_35:22">35:22</span> You have seen it, Yahweh. Don't keep
silent. Lord, don't be far from me.

<span id="an_35:23">35:23</span> Wake up! Rise up to defend me, my God!
My Lord, contend for me!

<span id="an_35:24">35:24</span> Vindicate me, Yahweh my God, according
to your righteousness. Don't let them gloat over me.

<span id="an_35:25">35:25</span> Don't let them say in their heart,
"Aha! That's the way we want it!" Don't let them say, "We have swallowed
him up!"

<span id="an_35:26">35:26</span> Let them be disappointed and confounded
together who rejoice at my calamity. Let them be clothed with shame and
dishonor who magnify themselves against me.

<span id="an_35:27">35:27</span> Let them shout for joy and be glad, who
favor my righteous cause. Yes, let them say continually, "Yahweh be
magnified, who has pleasure in the prosperity of his servant!"

<span id="an_35:28">35:28</span> My tongue shall talk about your
righteousness and about your praise all day long. For the Chief
Musician. By David, the servant of Yahweh.

<span id="an_36:1">36:1</span> An oracle is within my heart about the
disobedience of the wicked: "There is no fear of God before his eyes."

<span id="an_36:2">36:2</span> For he flatters himself in his own eyes,
too much to detect and hate his sin.

<span id="an_36:3">36:3</span> The words of his mouth are iniquity and
deceit. He has ceased to be wise and to do good.

<span id="an_36:4">36:4</span> He plots iniquity on his bed. He sets
himself in a way that is not good. He doesn't abhor evil.

<span id="an_36:5">36:5</span> Your loving kindness, Yahweh, is in the
heavens. Your faithfulness reaches to the skies.

<span id="an_36:6">36:6</span> Your righteousness is like the mountains
of God. Your judgments are like a great deep. Yahweh, you preserve man
and animal.

<span id="an_36:7">36:7</span> How precious is your loving kindness,
God! The children of men take refuge under the shadow of your wings.

<span id="an_36:8">36:8</span> They shall be abundantly satisfied with
the abundance of your house. You will make them drink of the river of
your pleasures.

<span id="an_36:9">36:9</span> For with you is the spring of life. In
your light shall we see light.

<span id="an_36:10">36:10</span> Oh continue your loving kindness to
those who know you, your righteousness to the upright in heart.

<span id="an_36:11">36:11</span> Don't let the foot of pride come
against me. Don't let the hand of the wicked drive me away.

<span id="an_36:12">36:12</span> There the workers of iniquity are
fallen. They are thrust down, and shall not be able to rise. By David.

<span id="an_37:1">37:1</span> Don't fret because of evildoers, neither
be envious against those who work unrighteousness.

<span id="an_37:2">37:2</span> For they shall soon be cut down like the
grass, and wither like the green herb.

<span id="an_37:3">37:3</span> Trust in Yahweh, and do good. Dwell in
the land, and enjoy safe pasture.

<span id="an_37:4">37:4</span> Also delight yourself in Yahweh, and he
will give you the desires of your heart.

<span id="an_37:5">37:5</span> Commit your way to Yahweh. Trust also in
him, and he will do this:

<span id="an_37:6">37:6</span> he will make your righteousness go forth
as the light, and your justice as the noon day sun.

<span id="an_37:7">37:7</span> Rest in Yahweh, and wait patiently for
him. Don't fret because of him who prospers in his way, because of the
man who makes wicked plots happen.

<span id="an_37:8">37:8</span> Cease from anger, and forsake wrath.
Don't fret, it leads only to evildoing.

<span id="an_37:9">37:9</span> For evildoers shall be cut off, but those
who wait for Yahweh shall inherit the land.

<span id="an_37:10">37:10</span> For yet a little while, and the wicked
will be no more. Yes, though you look for his place, he isn't there.

<span id="an_37:11">37:11</span> But the humble shall inherit the land,
and shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace.

<span id="an_37:12">37:12</span> The wicked plots against the just, and
gnashes at him with his teeth.

<span id="an_37:13">37:13</span> The Lord will laugh at him, for he sees
that his day is coming.

<span id="an_37:14">37:14</span> The wicked have drawn out the sword,
and have bent their bow, to cast down the poor and needy, to kill those
who are upright in the way.

<span id="an_37:15">37:15</span> Their sword shall enter into their own
heart. Their bows shall be broken.

<span id="an_37:16">37:16</span> Better is a little that the righteous
has, than the abundance of many wicked.

<span id="an_37:17">37:17</span> For the arms of the wicked shall be
broken, but Yahweh upholds the righteous.

<span id="an_37:18">37:18</span> Yahweh knows the days of the perfect.
Their inheritance shall be forever.

<span id="an_37:19">37:19</span> They shall not be disappointed in the
time of evil. In the days of famine they shall be satisfied.

<span id="an_37:20">37:20</span> But the wicked shall perish. The
enemies of Yahweh shall be like the beauty of the fields. They will
vanish-- vanish like smoke.

<span id="an_37:21">37:21</span> The wicked borrow, and don't pay back,
but the righteous give generously.

<span id="an_37:22">37:22</span> For such as are blessed by him shall
inherit the land. Those who are cursed by him shall be cut off.

<span id="an_37:23">37:23</span> A man's goings are established by
Yahweh. He delights in his way.

<span id="an_37:24">37:24</span> Though he stumble, he shall not fall,
for Yahweh holds him up with his hand.

<span id="an_37:25">37:25</span> I have been young, and now am old, yet
I have not seen the righteous forsaken, nor his children begging for
bread.

<span id="an_37:26">37:26</span> All day long he deals graciously, and
lends. His seed is blessed.

<span id="an_37:27">37:27</span> Depart from evil, and do good. Live
securely forever.

<span id="an_37:28">37:28</span> For Yahweh loves justice, and doesn't
forsake his saints. They are preserved forever, but the children of the
wicked shall be cut off.

<span id="an_37:29">37:29</span> The righteous shall inherit the land,
and live in it forever.

<span id="an_37:30">37:30</span> The mouth of the righteous talks of
wisdom. His tongue speaks justice.

<span id="an_37:31">37:31</span> The law of his God is in his heart.
None of his steps shall slide.

<span id="an_37:32">37:32</span> The wicked watches the righteous, and
seeks to kill him.

<span id="an_37:33">37:33</span> Yahweh will not leave him in his hand,
nor condemn him when he is judged.

<span id="an_37:34">37:34</span> Wait for Yahweh, and keep his way, and
he will exalt you to inherit the land. When the wicked are cut off, you
shall see it.

<span id="an_37:35">37:35</span> I have seen the wicked in great power,
spreading himself like a green tree in its native soil.

<span id="an_37:36">37:36</span> But he passed away, and behold, he was
not. Yes, I sought him, but he could not be found.

<span id="an_37:37">37:37</span> Mark the perfect man, and see the
upright, for there is a future for the man of peace.

<span id="an_37:38">37:38</span> As for transgressors, they shall be
destroyed together. The future of the wicked shall be cut off.

<span id="an_37:39">37:39</span> But the salvation of the righteous is
from Yahweh. He is their stronghold in the time of trouble.

<span id="an_37:40">37:40</span> Yahweh helps them, and rescues them. He
rescues them from the wicked, and saves them, Because they have taken
refuge in him. A Psalm by David, for a memorial.

<span id="an_38:1">38:1</span> Yahweh, don't rebuke me in your wrath,
neither chasten me in your hot displeasure.

<span id="an_38:2">38:2</span> For your arrows have pierced me, your
hand presses hard on me.

<span id="an_38:3">38:3</span> There is no soundness in my flesh because
of your indignation, neither is there any health in my bones because of
my sin.

<span id="an_38:4">38:4</span> For my iniquities have gone over my head.
As a heavy burden, they are too heavy for me.

<span id="an_38:5">38:5</span> My wounds are loathsome and corrupt,
because of my foolishness.

<span id="an_38:6">38:6</span> I am pained and bowed down greatly. I go
mourning all day long.

<span id="an_38:7">38:7</span> For my waist is filled with burning.
There is no soundness in my flesh.

<span id="an_38:8">38:8</span> I am faint and severely bruised. I have
groaned by reason of the anguish of my heart.

<span id="an_38:9">38:9</span> Lord, all my desire is before you. My
groaning is not hidden from you.

<span id="an_38:10">38:10</span> My heart throbs. My strength fails me.
As for the light of my eyes, it has also left me.

<span id="an_38:11">38:11</span> My lovers and my friends stand aloof
from my plague. My kinsmen stand far away.

<span id="an_38:12">38:12</span> They also who seek after my life lay
snares. Those who seek my hurt speak mischievous things, and meditate
deceits all day long.

<span id="an_38:13">38:13</span> But I, as a deaf man, don't hear. I am
as a mute man who doesn't open his mouth.

<span id="an_38:14">38:14</span> Yes, I am as a man who doesn't hear, in
whose mouth are no reproofs.

<span id="an_38:15">38:15</span> For in you, Yahweh, do I hope. You will
answer, Lord my God.

<span id="an_38:16">38:16</span> For I said, "Don't let them gloat over
me, or exalt themselves over me when my foot slips."

<span id="an_38:17">38:17</span> For I am ready to fall. My pain is
continually before me.

<span id="an_38:18">38:18</span> For I will declare my iniquity. I will
be sorry for my sin.

<span id="an_38:19">38:19</span> But my enemies are vigorous and many.
Those who hate me without reason are numerous.

<span id="an_38:20">38:20</span> They who also render evil for good are
adversaries to me, because I follow what is good.

<span id="an_38:21">38:21</span> Don't forsake me, Yahweh. My God, don't
be far from me.

<span id="an_38:22">38:22</span> Hurry to help me, Lord, my salvation.
For the Chief Musician. For Jeduthun. A Psalm by David.

<span id="an_39:1">39:1</span> I said, "I will watch my ways, so that I
don't sin with my tongue. I will keep my mouth with a bridle while the
wicked is before me."

<span id="an_39:2">39:2</span> I was mute with silence. I held my peace,
even from good. My sorrow was stirred.

<span id="an_39:3">39:3</span> My heart was hot within me. While I
meditated, the fire burned: I spoke with my tongue:

<span id="an_39:4">39:4</span> "Yahweh, show me my end, what is the
measure of my days. Let me know how frail I am.

<span id="an_39:5">39:5</span> Behold, you have made my days
handbreadths. My lifetime is as nothing before you. Surely every man
stands as a breath." Selah.

<span id="an_39:6">39:6</span> "Surely every man walks like a shadow.
Surely they busy themselves in vain. He heaps up, and doesn't know who
shall gather.

<span id="an_39:7">39:7</span> Now, Lord, what do I wait for? My hope is
in you.

<span id="an_39:8">39:8</span> Deliver me from all my transgressions.
Don't make me the reproach of the foolish.

<span id="an_39:9">39:9</span> I was mute. I didn't open my mouth,
because you did it.

<span id="an_39:10">39:10</span> Remove your scourge away from me. I am
overcome by the blow of your hand.

<span id="an_39:11">39:11</span> When you rebuke and correct man for
iniquity, You consume his wealth like a moth. Surely every man is but a
breath." Selah.

<span id="an_39:12">39:12</span> "Hear my prayer, Yahweh, and give ear
to my cry. Don't be silent at my tears. For I am a stranger with you, a
foreigner, as all my fathers were.

<span id="an_39:13">39:13</span> Oh spare me, that I may recover
strength, before I go away, and exist no more." For the Chief Musician.
A Psalm by David.

<span id="an_40:1">40:1</span> I waited patiently for Yahweh. He turned
to me, and heard my cry.

<span id="an_40:2">40:2</span> He brought me up also out of a horrible
pit, out of the miry clay. He set my feet on a rock, and gave me a firm
place to stand.

<span id="an_40:3">40:3</span> He has put a new song in my mouth, even
praise to our God. Many shall see it, and fear, and shall trust in
Yahweh.

<span id="an_40:4">40:4</span> Blessed is the man who makes Yahweh his
trust, and doesn't respect the proud, nor such as turn aside to lies.

<span id="an_40:5">40:5</span> Many, Yahweh, my God, are the wonderful
works which you have done, and your thoughts which are toward us. They
can't be declared back to you. If I would declare and speak of them,
they are more than can be numbered.

<span id="an_40:6">40:6</span> Sacrifice and offering you didn't desire.
You have opened my ears. You have not required burnt offering and sin
offering.

<span id="an_40:7">40:7</span> Then I said, "Behold, I have come. It is
written about me in the book in the scroll.

<span id="an_40:8">40:8</span> I delight to do your will, my God. Yes,
your law is within my heart."

<span id="an_40:9">40:9</span> I have proclaimed glad news of
righteousness in the great assembly. Behold, I will not seal my lips,
Yahweh, you know.

<span id="an_40:10">40:10</span> I have not hidden your righteousness
within my heart. I have declared your faithfulness and your salvation. I
have not concealed your loving kindness and your truth from the great
assembly.

<span id="an_40:11">40:11</span> Don't withhold your tender mercies from
me, Yahweh. Let your loving kindness and your truth continually preserve
me.

<span id="an_40:12">40:12</span> For innumerable evils have surrounded
me. My iniquities have overtaken me, so that I am not able to look up.
They are more than the hairs of my head. My heart has failed me.

<span id="an_40:13">40:13</span> Be pleased, Yahweh, to deliver me.
Hurry to help me, Yahweh.

<span id="an_40:14">40:14</span> Let them be disappointed and confounded
together who seek after my soul to destroy it. Let them be turned
backward and brought to dishonor who delight in my hurt.

<span id="an_40:15">40:15</span> Let them be desolate by reason of their
shame that tell me, "Aha! Aha!"

<span id="an_40:16">40:16</span> Let all those who seek you rejoice and
be glad in you. Let such as love your salvation say continually, "Let
Yahweh be exalted!"

<span id="an_40:17">40:17</span> But I am poor and needy. May the Lord
think about me. You are my help and my deliverer. Don't delay, my God.
For the Chief Musician. A Psalm by David.

<span id="an_41:1">41:1</span> Blessed is he who considers the poor.
Yahweh will deliver him in the day of evil.

<span id="an_41:2">41:2</span> Yahweh will preserve him, and keep him
alive. He shall be blessed on the earth, and he will not surrender him
to the will of his enemies.

<span id="an_41:3">41:3</span> Yahweh will sustain him on his sickbed,
and restore him from his bed of illness.

<span id="an_41:4">41:4</span> I said, "Yahweh, have mercy on me! Heal
me, for I have sinned against you."

<span id="an_41:5">41:5</span> My enemies speak evil against me: "When
will he die, and his name perish?"

<span id="an_41:6">41:6</span> If he comes to see me, he speaks
falsehood. His heart gathers iniquity to itself. When he goes abroad, he
tells it.

<span id="an_41:7">41:7</span> All who hate me whisper together against
me. They imagine the worst for me.

<span id="an_41:8">41:8</span> "An evil disease," they say, "has
afflicted him. Now that he lies he shall rise up no more."

<span id="an_41:9">41:9</span> Yes, my own familiar friend, in whom I
trusted, who ate bread with me, has lifted up his heel against me.

<span id="an_41:10">41:10</span> But you, Yahweh, have mercy on me, and
raise me up, that I may repay them.

<span id="an_41:11">41:11</span> By this I know that you delight in me,
because my enemy doesn't triumph over me.

<span id="an_41:12">41:12</span> As for me, you uphold me in my
integrity, and set me in your presence forever.

<span id="an_41:13">41:13</span> Blessed be Yahweh, the God of Israel,
from everlasting and to everlasting! Amen and amen. BOOK II For the
Chief Musician. A contemplation by the sons of Korah.

<span id="an_42:1">42:1</span> As the deer pants for the water brooks,
so my soul pants after you, God.

<span id="an_42:2">42:2</span> My soul thirsts for God, for the living
God. When shall I come and appear before God?

<span id="an_42:3">42:3</span> My tears have been my food day and night,
while they continually ask me, "Where is your God?"

<span id="an_42:4">42:4</span> These things I remember, and pour out my
soul within me, how I used to go with the crowd, and led them to the
house of God, with the voice of joy and praise, a multitude keeping a
holy day.

<span id="an_42:5">42:5</span> Why are you in despair, my soul? Why are
you disturbed within me? Hope in God! For I shall still praise him for
the saving help of his presence.

<span id="an_42:6">42:6</span> My God, my soul is in despair within me.
Therefore I remember you from the land of the Jordan, the heights of
Hermon, from the hill Mizar.

<span id="an_42:7">42:7</span> Deep calls to deep at the noise of your
waterfalls. All your waves and your billows have swept over me.

<span id="an_42:8">42:8</span> Yahweh will command his loving kindness
in the daytime. In the night his song shall be with me: a prayer to the
God of my life.

<span id="an_42:9">42:9</span> I will ask God, my rock, "Why have you
forgotten me? Why do I go mourning because of the oppression of the
enemy?"

<span id="an_42:10">42:10</span> As with a sword in my bones, my
adversaries reproach me, while they continually ask me, "Where is your
God?"

<span id="an_42:11">42:11</span> Why are you in despair, my soul? Why
are you disturbed within me? Hope in God! For I shall still praise him,
the saving help of my countenance, and my God.

<span id="an_43:1">43:1</span> Vindicate me, God, and plead my cause
against an ungodly nation. Oh, deliver me from deceitful and wicked men.

<span id="an_43:2">43:2</span> For you are the God of my strength. Why
have you rejected me? Why do I go mourning because of the oppression of
the enemy?

<span id="an_43:3">43:3</span> Oh, send out your light and your truth.
Let them lead me. Let them bring me to your holy hill, To your tents.

<span id="an_43:4">43:4</span> Then I will go to the altar of God, to
God, my exceeding joy. I will praise you on the harp, God, my God.

<span id="an_43:5">43:5</span> Why are you in despair, my soul? Why are
you disturbed within me? Hope in God! For I shall still praise him: my
Savior, my helper, and my God. For the Chief Musician. By the sons of
Korah. A contemplative psalm.

<span id="an_44:1">44:1</span> We have heard with our ears, God; our
fathers have told us, what work you did in their days, in the days of
old.

<span id="an_44:2">44:2</span> You drove out the nations with your hand,
but you planted them. You afflicted the peoples, but you spread them
abroad.

<span id="an_44:3">44:3</span> For they didn't get the land in
possession by their own sword, neither did their own arm save them; but
your right hand, and your arm, and the light of your face, because you
were favorable to them.

<span id="an_44:4">44:4</span> You are my King, God. Command victories
for Jacob!

<span id="an_44:5">44:5</span> Through you, will we push down our
adversaries. Through your name, will we tread them under who rise up
against us.

<span id="an_44:6">44:6</span> For I will not trust in my bow, neither
shall my sword save me.

<span id="an_44:7">44:7</span> But you have saved us from our
adversaries, and have shamed those who hate us.

<span id="an_44:8">44:8</span> In God we have made our boast all day
long, we will give thanks to your name forever. Selah.

<span id="an_44:9">44:9</span> But now you rejected us, and brought us
to dishonor, and don't go out with our armies.

<span id="an_44:10">44:10</span> You make us turn back from the
adversary. Those who hate us take spoil for themselves.

<span id="an_44:11">44:11</span> You have made us like sheep for food,
and have scattered us among the nations.

<span id="an_44:12">44:12</span> You sell your people for nothing, and
have gained nothing from their sale.

<span id="an_44:13">44:13</span> You make us a reproach to our
neighbors, a scoffing and a derision to those who are around us.

<span id="an_44:14">44:14</span> You make us a byword among the nations,
a shaking of the head among the peoples.

<span id="an_44:15">44:15</span> All day long my dishonor is before me,
and shame covers my face,

<span id="an_44:16">44:16</span> At the taunt of one who reproaches and
verbally abuses, because of the enemy and the avenger.

<span id="an_44:17">44:17</span> All this has come on us, yet have we
not forgotten you, Neither have we been false to your covenant.

<span id="an_44:18">44:18</span> Our heart has not turned back, neither
have our steps strayed from your path,

<span id="an_44:19">44:19</span> Though you have crushed us in the haunt
of jackals, and covered us with the shadow of death.

<span id="an_44:20">44:20</span> If we have forgotten the name of our
God, or spread forth our hands to a strange god;

<span id="an_44:21">44:21</span> won't God search this out? For he knows
the secrets of the heart.

<span id="an_44:22">44:22</span> Yes, for your sake we are killed all
day long. We are regarded as sheep for the slaughter.

<span id="an_44:23">44:23</span> Wake up! Why do you sleep, Lord? Arise!
Don't reject us forever.

<span id="an_44:24">44:24</span> Why do you hide your face, and forget
our affliction and our oppression?

<span id="an_44:25">44:25</span> For our soul is bowed down to the dust.
Our body clings to the earth.

<span id="an_44:26">44:26</span> Rise up to help us. Redeem us for your
loving kindness' sake. For the Chief Musician. Set to "The Lilies." A
contemplation by the sons of Korah. A wedding song.

<span id="an_45:1">45:1</span> My heart overflows with a noble theme. I
recite my verses for the king. My tongue is like the pen of a skillful
writer.

<span id="an_45:2">45:2</span> You are the most excellent of the sons of
men. Grace has anointed your lips, therefore God has blessed you
forever.

<span id="an_45:3">45:3</span> Strap your sword on your thigh, mighty
one: your splendor and your majesty.

<span id="an_45:4">45:4</span> In your majesty ride on victoriously on
behalf of truth, humility, and righteousness. Let your right hand
display awesome deeds.

<span id="an_45:5">45:5</span> Your arrows are sharp. The nations fall
under you, with arrows in the heart of the king's enemies.

<span id="an_45:6">45:6</span> Your throne, God, is forever and ever. A
scepter of equity is the scepter of your kingdom.

<span id="an_45:7">45:7</span> You have loved righteousness, and hated
wickedness. Therefore God, your God, has anointed you with the oil of
gladness above your fellows.

<span id="an_45:8">45:8</span> All your garments smell like myrrh,
aloes, and cassia. Out of ivory palaces stringed instruments have made
you glad.

<span id="an_45:9">45:9</span> Kings' daughters are among your honorable
women. At your right hand the queen stands in gold of Ophir.

<span id="an_45:10">45:10</span> Listen, daughter, consider, and turn
your ear. Forget your own people, and also your father's house.

<span id="an_45:11">45:11</span> So the king will desire your beauty,
honor him, for he is your lord.

<span id="an_45:12">45:12</span> The daughter of Tyre comes with a gift.
The rich among the people entreat your favor.

<span id="an_45:13">45:13</span> The princess inside is all glorious.
Her clothing is interwoven with gold.

<span id="an_45:14">45:14</span> She shall be led to the king in
embroidered work. The virgins, her companions who follow her, shall be
brought to you.

<span id="an_45:15">45:15</span> With gladness and rejoicing they shall
be led. They shall enter into the king's palace.

<span id="an_45:16">45:16</span> Your sons will take the place of your
fathers. You shall make them princes in all the earth.

<span id="an_45:17">45:17</span> I will make your name to be remembered
in all generations. Therefore the peoples shall give you thanks forever
and ever. For the Chief Musician. By the sons of Korah. According to
Alamoth.

<span id="an_46:1">46:1</span> God is our refuge and strength, a very
present help in trouble.

<span id="an_46:2">46:2</span> Therefore we won't be afraid, though the
earth changes, though the mountains are shaken into the heart of the
seas;

<span id="an_46:3">46:3</span> though its waters roar and are troubled,
though the mountains tremble with their swelling. Selah.

<span id="an_46:4">46:4</span> There is a river, the streams of which
make the city of God glad, the holy place of the tents of the Most High.

<span id="an_46:5">46:5</span> God is in her midst. She shall not be
moved. God will help her at dawn.

<span id="an_46:6">46:6</span> The nations raged. The kingdoms were
moved. He lifted his voice, and the earth melted.

<span id="an_46:7">46:7</span> Yahweh of Armies is with us. The God of
Jacob is our refuge. Selah.

<span id="an_46:8">46:8</span> Come, see Yahweh's works, what
desolations he has made in the earth.

<span id="an_46:9">46:9</span> He makes wars cease to the end of the
earth. He breaks the bow, and shatters the spear. He burns the chariots
in the fire.

<span id="an_46:10">46:10</span> "Be still, and know that I am God. I
will be exalted among the nations. I will be exalted in the earth."

Jacob is our refuge. Selah. For the Chief Musician. A Psalm by the sons

<span id="an_47:1">47:1</span> Oh clap your hands, all you nations.
Shout to God with the voice of triumph!

<span id="an_47:2">47:2</span> For Yahweh Most High is awesome. He is a

<span id="an_47:4">47:4</span> He chooses our inheritance for us, the

King.

<span id="an_48:3">48:3</span> God has shown himself in her citadels as
a refuge.

<span id="an_48:4">48:4</span> For, behold, the kings assembled
themselves, they passed by together.

<span id="an_48:5">48:5</span> They saw it, then they were amazed. They
were dismayed. They hurried away.

<span id="an_48:6">48:6</span> Trembling took hold of them there, pain,
as of a woman in travail.

<span id="an_48:7">48:7</span> With the east wind, you break the ships
of Tarshish.

<span id="an_48:8">48:8</span> As we have heard, so we have seen, in the
city of Yahweh of Armies, in the city of our God. God will establish it
forever. Selah.

<span id="an_48:9">48:9</span> We have thought about your loving
kindness, God, in the midst of your temple.

<span id="an_48:10">48:10</span> As is your name, God, so is your praise
to the ends of the earth. Your right hand is full of righteousness.

<span id="an_48:11">48:11</span> Let Mount Zion be glad! Let the
daughters of Judah rejoice, Because of your judgments.

<span id="an_48:12">48:12</span> Walk about Zion, and go around her.
Number its towers.

<span id="an_48:13">48:13</span> Mark well her bulwarks. Consider her
palaces, that you may tell it to the next generation.

<span id="an_48:14">48:14</span> For this God is our God forever and
ever. He will be our guide even to death. For the Chief Musician. A
Psalm by the sons of Korah.

<span id="an_49:1">49:1</span> Hear this, all you peoples. Listen, all
you inhabitants of the world,

<span id="an_49:2">49:2</span> both low and high, rich and poor
together.

<span id="an_49:3">49:3</span> My mouth will speak words of wisdom. My
heart shall utter understanding.

<span id="an_49:4">49:4</span> I will incline my ear to a proverb. I
will open my riddle on the harp.

<span id="an_49:5">49:5</span> Why should I fear in the days of evil,
when iniquity at my heels surrounds me?

<span id="an_49:6">49:6</span> Those who trust in their wealth, and
boast in the multitude of their riches--

<span id="an_49:7">49:7</span> none of them can by any means redeem his
brother, nor give God a ransom for him.

<span id="an_49:8">49:8</span> For the redemption of their life is
costly, no payment is ever enough,

<span id="an_49:9">49:9</span> That he should live on forever, that he
should not see corruption.

<span id="an_49:10">49:10</span> For he sees that wise men die; likewise
the fool and the senseless perish, and leave their wealth to others.

<span id="an_49:11">49:11</span> Their inward thought is that their
houses will endure forever, and their dwelling places to all
generations. They name their lands after themselves.

<span id="an_49:12">49:12</span> But man, despite his riches, doesn't
endure. He is like the animals that perish.

<span id="an_49:13">49:13</span> This is the destiny of those who are
foolish, and of those who approve their sayings. Selah.

<span id="an_49:14">49:14</span> They are appointed as a flock for
Sheol. Death shall be their shepherd. The upright shall have dominion
over them in the morning. Their beauty shall decay in Sheol, far from
their mansion.

<span id="an_49:15">49:15</span> But God will redeem my soul from the
power of Sheol, for he will receive me. Selah.

<span id="an_49:16">49:16</span> Don't be afraid when a man is made
rich, when the glory of his house is increased.

<span id="an_49:17">49:17</span> For when he dies he shall carry nothing
away. His glory shall not descend after him.

<span id="an_49:18">49:18</span> Though while he lived he blessed his
soul-- and men praise you when you do well for yourself--

<span id="an_49:19">49:19</span> he shall go to the generation of his
fathers. They shall never see the light.

<span id="an_49:20">49:20</span> A man who has riches without
understanding, is like the animals that perish. A Psalm by Asaph.

<span id="an_50:1">50:1</span> The Mighty One, God, Yahweh, speaks, and
calls the earth from sunrise to sunset.

<span id="an_50:2">50:2</span> Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty,
God shines forth.

<span id="an_50:3">50:3</span> Our God comes, and does not keep silent.
A fire devours before him. It is very stormy around him.

<span id="an_50:4">50:4</span> He calls to the heavens above, to the
earth, that he may judge his people:

<span id="an_50:5">50:5</span> "Gather my saints together to me, those
who have made a covenant with me by sacrifice."

<span id="an_50:6">50:6</span> The heavens shall declare his
righteousness, for God himself is judge. Selah.

<span id="an_50:7">50:7</span> "Hear, my people, and I will speak;
Israel, and I will testify against you. I am God, your God.

<span id="an_50:8">50:8</span> I don't rebuke you for your sacrifices.
Your burnt offerings are continually before me.

<span id="an_50:9">50:9</span> I have no need for a bull from your
stall, nor male goats from your pens.

<span id="an_50:10">50:10</span> For every animal of the forest is mine,
and the livestock on a thousand hills.

<span id="an_50:11">50:11</span> I know all the birds of the mountains.
The wild animals of the field are mine.

<span id="an_50:12">50:12</span> If I were hungry, I would not tell you,
for the world is mine, and all that is in it.

<span id="an_50:13">50:13</span> Will I eat the flesh of bulls, or drink
the blood of goats?

<span id="an_50:14">50:14</span> Offer to God the sacrifice of
thanksgiving. Pay your vows to the Most High.

<span id="an_50:15">50:15</span> Call on me in the day of trouble. I
will deliver you, and you will honor me."

<span id="an_50:16">50:16</span> But to the wicked God says, "What right
do you have to declare my statutes, that you have taken my covenant on
your lips,

<span id="an_50:17">50:17</span> since you hate instruction, and throw
my words behind you?

<span id="an_50:18">50:18</span> When you saw a thief, you consented
with him, and have participated with adulterers.

<span id="an_50:19">50:19</span> "You give your mouth to evil. Your
tongue frames deceit.

<span id="an_50:20">50:20</span> You sit and speak against your brother.
You slander your own mother's son.

<span id="an_50:21">50:21</span> You have done these things, and I kept
silent. You thought that I was just like you. I will rebuke you, and
accuse you in front of your eyes.

<span id="an_50:22">50:22</span> "Now consider this, you who forget God,
lest I tear you into pieces, and there be none to deliver.

<span id="an_50:23">50:23</span> Whoever offers the sacrifice of
thanksgiving glorifies me, and prepares his way so that I will show
God's salvation to him." For the Chief Musician. A Psalm by David, when
Nathan the prophet came to him, after he had gone in to Bathsheba.

<span id="an_51:1">51:1</span> Have mercy on me, God, according to your
loving kindness. According to the multitude of your tender mercies, blot
out my transgressions.

<span id="an_51:2">51:2</span> Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity.
Cleanse me from my sin.

<span id="an_51:3">51:3</span> For I know my transgressions. My sin is
constantly before me.

<span id="an_51:4">51:4</span> Against you, and you only, have I sinned,
and done that which is evil in your sight; that you may be proved right
when you speak, and justified when you judge.

<span id="an_51:5">51:5</span> Behold, I was brought forth in iniquity.
In sin my mother conceived me.

<span id="an_51:6">51:6</span> Behold, you desire truth in the inward
parts. You teach me wisdom in the inmost place.

<span id="an_51:7">51:7</span> Purify me with hyssop, and I will be
clean. Wash me, and I will be whiter than snow.

<span id="an_51:8">51:8</span> Let me hear joy and gladness, That the
bones which you have broken may rejoice.

<span id="an_51:9">51:9</span> Hide your face from my sins, and blot out
all of my iniquities.

<span id="an_51:10">51:10</span> Create in me a clean heart, O God.
Renew a right spirit within me.

<span id="an_51:11">51:11</span> Don't throw me from your presence, and
don't take your holy Spirit from me.

<span id="an_51:12">51:12</span> Restore to me the joy of your
salvation. Uphold me with a willing spirit.

<span id="an_51:13">51:13</span> Then I will teach transgressors your
ways. Sinners shall be converted to you.

<span id="an_51:14">51:14</span> Deliver me from bloodguiltiness, O God,
the God of my salvation. My tongue shall sing aloud of your
righteousness.

<span id="an_51:15">51:15</span> Lord, open my lips. My mouth shall
declare your praise.

<span id="an_51:16">51:16</span> For you don't delight in sacrifice, or
else I would give it. You have no pleasure in burnt offering.

<span id="an_51:17">51:17</span> The sacrifices of God are a broken
spirit. A broken and contrite heart, O God, you will not despise.

<span id="an_51:18">51:18</span> Do well in your good pleasure to Zion.
Build the walls of Jerusalem.

<span id="an_51:19">51:19</span> Then you will delight in the sacrifices
of righteousness, in burnt offerings and in whole burnt offerings. Then
they will offer bulls on your altar. For the Chief Musician. A
contemplation by David, when Doeg the Edomite came and told Saul, "David
has come to Abimelech's house."

<span id="an_52:1">52:1</span> Why do you boast of mischief, mighty man?
God's loving kindness endures continually.

<span id="an_52:2">52:2</span> Your tongue plots destruction, like a
sharp razor, working deceitfully.

<span id="an_52:3">52:3</span> You love evil more than good, lying
rather than speaking the truth. Selah.

<span id="an_52:4">52:4</span> You love all devouring words, you
deceitful tongue.

<span id="an_52:5">52:5</span> God will likewise destroy you forever. He
will take you up, and pluck you out of your tent, and root you out of
the land of the living. Selah.

<span id="an_52:6">52:6</span> The righteous also will see it, and fear,
and laugh at him, saying,

<span id="an_52:7">52:7</span> "Behold, this is the man who didn't make
God his strength, but trusted in the abundance of his riches, and
strengthened himself in his wickedness."

<span id="an_52:8">52:8</span> But as for me, I am like a green olive
tree in God's house. I trust in God's loving kindness forever and ever.

<span id="an_52:9">52:9</span> I will give you thanks forever, because
you have done it. I will hope in your name, for it is good, in the
presence of your saints. For the Chief Musician. To the tune of
"Mahalath." A contemplation by David.

<span id="an_53:1">53:1</span> The fool has said in his heart, "There is
no God." They are corrupt, and have done abominable iniquity. There is
no one who does good.

<span id="an_53:2">53:2</span> God looks down from heaven on the
children of men, to see if there are any who understood, who seek after
God.

<span id="an_53:3">53:3</span> Every one of them has gone back. They
have become filthy together. There is no one who does good, no, not one.

<span id="an_53:4">53:4</span> Have the workers of iniquity no
knowledge, who eat up my people as they eat bread, and don't call on
God?

<span id="an_53:5">53:5</span> There they were in great fear, where no
fear was, for God has scattered the bones of him who encamps against
you. You have put them to shame, because God has rejected them.

<span id="an_53:6">53:6</span> Oh that the salvation of Israel would
come out of Zion! When God brings back his people from captivity, then
Jacob shall rejoice, and Israel shall be glad. For the Chief Musician.
On stringed instruments. A contemplation by David, when the Ziphites
came and said to Saul, "Isn't David hiding himself among us?"

<span id="an_54:1">54:1</span> Save me, God, by your name. Vindicate me
in your might.

<span id="an_54:2">54:2</span> Hear my prayer, God. Listen to the words
of my mouth.

<span id="an_54:3">54:3</span> For strangers have risen up against me.
Violent men have sought after my soul. They haven't set God before them.
Selah.

<span id="an_54:4">54:4</span> Behold, God is my helper. The Lord is the
one who sustains my soul.

<span id="an_54:5">54:5</span> He will repay the evil to my enemies.
Destroy them in your truth.

<span id="an_54:6">54:6</span> With a free will offering, I will
sacrifice to you. I will give thanks to your name, Yahweh, for it is
good.

<span id="an_54:7">54:7</span> For he has delivered me out of all
trouble. My eye has seen triumph over my enemies. For the Chief
Musician. On stringed instruments. A contemplation by David.

<span id="an_55:1">55:1</span> Listen to my prayer, God. Don't hide
yourself from my supplication.

<span id="an_55:2">55:2</span> Attend to me, and answer me. I am
restless in my complaint, and moan,

<span id="an_55:3">55:3</span> Because of the voice of the enemy,
Because of the oppression of the wicked. For they bring suffering on me.
In anger they hold a grudge against me.

<span id="an_55:4">55:4</span> My heart is severely pained within me.
The terrors of death have fallen on me.

<span id="an_55:5">55:5</span> Fearfulness and trembling have come on
me. Horror has overwhelmed me.

<span id="an_55:6">55:6</span> I said, "Oh that I had wings like a dove!
Then I would fly away, and be at rest.

<span id="an_55:7">55:7</span> Behold, then I would wander far off. I
would lodge in the wilderness." Selah.

<span id="an_55:8">55:8</span> "I would hurry to a shelter from the
stormy wind and storm."

<span id="an_55:9">55:9</span> Confuse them, Lord, and confound their
language, for I have seen violence and strife in the city.

<span id="an_55:10">55:10</span> Day and night they prowl around on its
walls. Malice and abuse are also within her.

<span id="an_55:11">55:11</span> Destructive forces are within her.
Threats and lies don't depart from her streets.

<span id="an_55:12">55:12</span> For it was not an enemy who insulted
me, then I could have endured it. Neither was it he who hated me who
raised himself up against me, then I would have hidden myself from him.

<span id="an_55:13">55:13</span> But it was you, a man like me, my
companion, and my familiar friend.

<span id="an_55:14">55:14</span> We took sweet fellowship together. We
walked in God's house with company.

<span id="an_55:15">55:15</span> Let death come suddenly on them. Let
them go down alive into Sheol. For wickedness is in their dwelling, in
the midst of them.

<span id="an_55:16">55:16</span> As for me, I will call on God. Yahweh
will save me.

<span id="an_55:17">55:17</span> Evening, morning, and at noon, I will
cry out in distress. He will hear my voice.

<span id="an_55:18">55:18</span> He has redeemed my soul in peace from
the battle that was against me, although there are many who oppose me.

<span id="an_55:19">55:19</span> God, who is enthroned forever, will
hear, and answer them. Selah. They never change, who don't fear God.

<span id="an_55:20">55:20</span> He raises his hands against his
friends. He has violated his covenant.

<span id="an_55:21">55:21</span> His mouth was smooth as butter, but his
heart was war. His words were softer than oil, yet they were drawn
swords.

<span id="an_55:22">55:22</span> Cast your burden on Yahweh, and he will
sustain you. He will never allow the righteous to be moved.

<span id="an_55:23">55:23</span> But you, God, will bring them down into
the pit of destruction. Bloodthirsty and deceitful men shall not live
out half their days, but I will trust in you. For the Chief Musician. To
the tune of "Silent Dove in Distant Lands." A poem by David, when the
Philistines seized him in Gath.

<span id="an_56:1">56:1</span> Be merciful to me, God, for man wants to
swallow me up. All day long, he attacks and oppresses me.

<span id="an_56:2">56:2</span> My enemies want to swallow me up all day
long, for they are many who fight proudly against me.

<span id="an_56:3">56:3</span> When I am afraid, I will put my trust in
you.

<span id="an_56:4">56:4</span> In God, I praise his word. In God, I put
my trust. I will not be afraid. What can flesh do to me?

<span id="an_56:5">56:5</span> All day long they twist my words. All
their thoughts are against me for evil.

<span id="an_56:6">56:6</span> They conspire and lurk, watching my
steps, they are eager to take my life.

<span id="an_56:7">56:7</span> Shall they escape by iniquity? In anger
cast down the peoples, God.

<span id="an_56:8">56:8</span> You number my wanderings. You put my
tears into your bottle. Aren't they in your book?

<span id="an_56:9">56:9</span> Then my enemies shall turn back in the
day that I call. I know this, that God is for me.

<span id="an_56:10">56:10</span> In God, I will praise his word. In
Yahweh, I will praise his word.

<span id="an_56:11">56:11</span> I have put my trust in God. I will not
be afraid. What can man do to me?

<span id="an_56:12">56:12</span> Your vows are on me, God. I will give
thank offerings to you.

<span id="an_56:13">56:13</span> For you have delivered my soul from
death, and prevented my feet from falling, that I may walk before God in
the light of the living. For the Chief Musician. To the tune of "Do Not
Destroy." A poem by David, when he fled from Saul, in the cave.

<span id="an_57:1">57:1</span> Be merciful to me, God, be merciful to
me, for my soul takes refuge in you. Yes, in the shadow of your wings, I
will take refuge, until disaster has passed.

<span id="an_57:2">57:2</span> I cry out to God Most High, to God who
accomplishes my requests for me.

<span id="an_57:3">57:3</span> He will send from heaven, and save me, he
rebukes the one who is pursuing me. Selah. God will send out his loving
kindness and his truth.

<span id="an_57:4">57:4</span> My soul is among lions. I lie among those
who are set on fire, even the sons of men, whose teeth are spears and
arrows, and their tongue a sharp sword.

<span id="an_57:5">57:5</span> Be exalted, God, above the heavens! Let
your glory be above all the earth!

<span id="an_57:6">57:6</span> They have prepared a net for my steps. My
soul is bowed down. They dig a pit before me. They fall into its midst
themselves. Selah.

<span id="an_57:7">57:7</span> My heart is steadfast, God, my heart is
steadfast. I will sing, yes, I will sing praises.

<span id="an_57:8">57:8</span> Wake up, my glory! Wake up, psaltery and
harp! I will wake up the dawn.

<span id="an_57:9">57:9</span> I will give thanks to you, Lord, among
the peoples. I will sing praises to you among the nations.

<span id="an_57:10">57:10</span> For your great loving kindness reaches
to the heavens, and your truth to the skies.

<span id="an_57:11">57:11</span> Be exalted, God, above the heavens. Let
your glory be over all the earth. For the Chief Musician. To the tune of
"Do Not Destroy." A poem by David.

<span id="an_58:1">58:1</span> Do you indeed speak righteousness, silent
ones? Do you judge blamelessly, you sons of men?

<span id="an_58:2">58:2</span> No, in your heart you plot injustice. You
measure out the violence of your hands in the earth.

<span id="an_58:3">58:3</span> The wicked go astray from the womb. They
are wayward as soon as they are born, speaking lies.

<span id="an_58:4">58:4</span> Their poison is like the poison of a
snake; like a deaf cobra that stops its ear,

<span id="an_58:5">58:5</span> which doesn't listen to the voice of
charmers, no matter how skillful the charmer may be.

<span id="an_58:6">58:6</span> Break their teeth, God, in their mouth.
Break out the great teeth of the young lions, Yahweh.

<span id="an_58:7">58:7</span> Let them vanish as water that flows away.
When they draw the bow, let their arrows be made blunt.

<span id="an_58:8">58:8</span> Let them be like a snail which melts and
passes away, like the stillborn child, who has not seen the sun.

<span id="an_58:9">58:9</span> Before your pots can feel the heat of the
thorns, he will sweep away the green and the burning alike.

<span id="an_58:10">58:10</span> The righteous shall rejoice when he
sees the vengeance. He shall wash his feet in the blood of the wicked;

<span id="an_58:11">58:11</span> so that men shall say, "Most certainly
there is a reward for the righteous. Most certainly there is a God who
judges the earth." For the Chief Musician. To the tune of "Do Not
Destroy." A poem by David, when Saul sent, and they watched the house to
kill him.

<span id="an_59:1">59:1</span> Deliver me from my enemies, my God. Set
me on high from those who rise up against me.

<span id="an_59:2">59:2</span> Deliver me from the workers of iniquity.
Save me from the bloodthirsty men.

<span id="an_59:3">59:3</span> For, behold, they lie in wait for my
soul. The mighty gather themselves together against me, not for my
disobedience, nor for my sin, Yahweh.

<span id="an_59:4">59:4</span> I have done no wrong, yet they are ready
to attack me. Rise up, behold, and help me!

<span id="an_59:5">59:5</span> You, Yahweh God of Armies, the God of
Israel, rouse yourself to punish the nations. Show no mercy to the
wicked traitors. Selah.

<span id="an_59:6">59:6</span> They return at evening, howling like
dogs, and prowl around the city.

<span id="an_59:7">59:7</span> Behold, they spew with their mouth.
Swords are in their lips, "For," they say, "who hears us?"

<span id="an_59:8">59:8</span> But you, Yahweh, laugh at them. You scoff
at all the nations.

<span id="an_59:9">59:9</span> Oh, my Strength, I watch for you, for God
is my high tower.

<span id="an_59:10">59:10</span> My God will go before me with his
loving kindness. God will let me look at my enemies in triumph.

<span id="an_59:11">59:11</span> Don't kill them, or my people may
forget. Scatter them by your power, and bring them down, Lord our
shield.

<span id="an_59:12">59:12</span> For the sin of their mouth, and the
words of their lips, let them be caught in their pride, for the curses
and lies which they utter.

<span id="an_59:13">59:13</span> Consume them in wrath. Consume them,
and they will be no more. Let them know that God rules in Jacob, to the
ends of the earth. Selah.

<span id="an_59:14">59:14</span> At evening let them return. Let them
howl like a dog, and go around the city.

<span id="an_59:15">59:15</span> They shall wander up and down for food,
and wait all night if they aren't satisfied.

<span id="an_59:16">59:16</span> But I will sing of your strength. Yes,
I will sing aloud of your loving kindness in the morning. For you have
been my high tower, a refuge in the day of my distress.

<span id="an_59:17">59:17</span> To you, my strength, I will sing
praises. For God is my high tower, the God of my mercy. For the Chief
Musician. To the tune of "The Lily of the Covenant." A teaching poem by
David, when he fought with Aram Naharaim and with Aram Zobah, and Joab
returned, and killed twelve thousand of Edom in the Valley of Salt.

<span id="an_60:1">60:1</span> God, you have rejected us. You have
broken us down. You have been angry. Restore us, again.

<span id="an_60:2">60:2</span> You have made the land tremble. You have
torn it. Mend its fractures, for it quakes.

<span id="an_60:3">60:3</span> You have shown your people hard things.
You have made us drink the wine that makes us stagger.

<span id="an_60:4">60:4</span> You have given a banner to those who fear
you, that it may be displayed because of the truth. Selah.

<span id="an_60:5">60:5</span> So that your beloved may be delivered,
save with your right hand, and answer us.

<span id="an_60:6">60:6</span> God has spoken from his sanctuary: "I
will triumph. I will divide Shechem, and measure out the valley of
Succoth.

<span id="an_60:7">60:7</span> Gilead is mine, and Manasseh is mine.
Ephraim also is the defense of my head. Judah is my scepter.

<span id="an_60:8">60:8</span> Moab is my wash basin. I will throw my
shoe on Edom. I shout in triumph over Philistia."

<span id="an_60:9">60:9</span> Who will bring me into the strong city?
Who has led me to Edom?

<span id="an_60:10">60:10</span> Haven't you, God, rejected us? You
don't go out with our armies, God.

<span id="an_60:11">60:11</span> Give us help against the adversary, for
the help of man is vain.

<span id="an_60:12">60:12</span> Through God we shall do valiantly, for
it is he who will tread down our adversaries. For the Chief Musician.
For a stringed instrument. By David.

<span id="an_61:1">61:1</span> Hear my cry, God. Listen to my prayer.

<span id="an_61:2">61:2</span> From the end of the earth, I will call to
you, when my heart is overwhelmed. Lead me to the rock that is higher
than I.

<span id="an_61:3">61:3</span> For you have been a refuge for me, a
strong tower from the enemy.

<span id="an_61:4">61:4</span> I will dwell in your tent forever. I will
take refuge in the shelter of your wings. Selah.

<span id="an_61:5">61:5</span> For you, God, have heard my vows. You
have given me the heritage of those who fear your name.

<span id="an_61:6">61:6</span> You will prolong the king's life; his
years shall be for generations.

<span id="an_61:7">61:7</span> He shall be enthroned in God's presence
forever. Appoint your loving kindness and truth, that they may preserve
him.

<span id="an_61:8">61:8</span> So I will sing praise to your name
forever, that I may fulfill my vows daily. For the Chief Musician. To
Jeduthan. A Psalm by David.

<span id="an_62:1">62:1</span> My soul rests in God alone. My salvation
is from him.

<span id="an_62:2">62:2</span> He alone is my rock and my salvation, my
fortress-- I will never be greatly shaken.

<span id="an_62:3">62:3</span> How long will you assault a man, would
all of you throw him down, Like a leaning wall, like a tottering fence?

<span id="an_62:4">62:4</span> They fully intend to throw him down from
his lofty place. They delight in lies. They bless with their mouth, but
they curse inwardly. Selah.

<span id="an_62:5">62:5</span> My soul, wait in silence for God alone,
for my expectation is from him.

<span id="an_62:6">62:6</span> He alone is my rock and my salvation, my
fortress. I will not be shaken.

<span id="an_62:7">62:7</span> With God is my salvation and my honor.
The rock of my strength, and my refuge, is in God.

<span id="an_62:8">62:8</span> Trust in him at all times, you people.
Pour out your heart before him. God is a refuge for us. Selah.

<span id="an_62:9">62:9</span> Surely men of low degree are just a
breath, and men of high degree are a lie. In the balances they will go
up. They are together lighter than a breath.

<span id="an_62:10">62:10</span> Don't trust in oppression. Don't become
vain in robbery. If riches increase, don't set your heart on them.

<span id="an_62:11">62:11</span> God has spoken once; twice I have heard
this, that power belongs to God.

<span id="an_62:12">62:12</span> Also to you, Lord, belongs loving
kindness, for you reward every man according to his work. A Psalm by
David, when he was in the desert of Judah.

<span id="an_63:1">63:1</span> God, you are my God. I will earnestly
seek you. My soul thirsts for you. My flesh longs for you, in a dry and
weary land, where there is no water.

<span id="an_63:2">63:2</span> So I have seen you in the sanctuary,
watching your power and your glory.

<span id="an_63:3">63:3</span> Because your loving kindness is better
than life, my lips shall praise you.

<span id="an_63:4">63:4</span> So I will bless you while I live. I will
lift up my hands in your name.

<span id="an_63:5">63:5</span> My soul shall be satisfied as with the
richest food. My mouth shall praise you with joyful lips,

<span id="an_63:6">63:6</span> when I remember you on my bed, and think
about you in the night watches.

<span id="an_63:7">63:7</span> For you have been my help. I will rejoice
in the shadow of your wings.

<span id="an_63:8">63:8</span> My soul stays close to you. Your right
hand holds me up.

<span id="an_63:9">63:9</span> But those who seek my soul, to destroy
it, shall go into the lower parts of the earth.

<span id="an_63:10">63:10</span> They shall be given over to the power
of the sword. They shall be jackal food.

<span id="an_63:11">63:11</span> But the king shall rejoice in God.
Everyone who swears by him will praise him, for the mouth of those who
speak lies shall be silenced. For the Chief Musician. A Psalm by David.

<span id="an_64:1">64:1</span> Hear my voice, God, in my complaint.
Preserve my life from fear of the enemy.

<span id="an_64:2">64:2</span> Hide me from the conspiracy of the
wicked, from the noisy crowd of the ones doing evil;

<span id="an_64:3">64:3</span> who sharpen their tongue like a sword,
and aim their arrows, deadly words,

<span id="an_64:4">64:4</span> to shoot innocent men from ambushes. They
shoot at him suddenly and fearlessly.

<span id="an_64:5">64:5</span> They encourage themselves in evil plans.
They talk about laying snares secretly. They say, "Who will see them?"

<span id="an_64:6">64:6</span> They plot injustice, saying, "We have
made a perfect plan!" Surely man's mind and heart are cunning.

<span id="an_64:7">64:7</span> But God will shoot at them. They will be
suddenly struck down with an arrow.

<span id="an_64:8">64:8</span> Their own tongues shall ruin them. All
who see them will shake their heads.

<span id="an_64:9">64:9</span> All mankind shall be afraid. They shall
declare the work of God, and shall wisely ponder what he has done.

<span id="an_64:10">64:10</span> The righteous shall be glad in Yahweh,
and shall take refuge in him. All the upright in heart shall praise him!
For the Chief Musician. A Psalm by David. A song.

<span id="an_65:1">65:1</span> Praise waits for you, God, in Zion. To
you shall vows be performed.

<span id="an_65:2">65:2</span> You who hear prayer, to you all men will
come.

<span id="an_65:3">65:3</span> Sins overwhelmed me, but you atoned for
our transgressions.

<span id="an_65:4">65:4</span> Blessed is one whom you choose, and cause
to come near, that he may live in your courts. We will be filled with
the goodness of your house, your holy temple.

<span id="an_65:5">65:5</span> By awesome deeds of righteousness, you
answer us, God of our salvation. You who are the hope of all the ends of
the earth, of those who are far away on the sea;

<span id="an_65:6">65:6</span> Who by his power forms the mountains,
having armed yourself with strength;

<span id="an_65:7">65:7</span> who stills the roaring of the seas, the
roaring of their waves, and the turmoil of the nations.

<span id="an_65:8">65:8</span> They also who dwell in faraway places are
afraid at your wonders. You call the morning's dawn and the evening with
songs of joy.

<span id="an_65:9">65:9</span> You visit the earth, and water it. You
greatly enrich it. The river of God is full of water. You provide them
grain, for so you have ordained it.

<span id="an_65:10">65:10</span> You drench its furrows. You level its
ridges. You soften it with showers. You bless it with a crop.

<span id="an_65:11">65:11</span> You crown the year with your bounty.
Your carts overflow with abundance.

<span id="an_65:12">65:12</span> The wilderness grasslands overflow. The
hills are clothed with gladness.

<span id="an_65:13">65:13</span> The pastures are covered with flocks.
The valleys also are clothed with grain. They shout for joy! They also
sing. For the Chief Musician. A song. A Psalm.

<span id="an_66:1">66:1</span> Make a joyful shout to God, all the
earth!

<span id="an_66:2">66:2</span> Sing to the glory of his name! Offer
glory and praise!

<span id="an_66:3">66:3</span> Tell God, "How awesome are your deeds!
Through the greatness of your power, your enemies submit themselves to
you.

<span id="an_66:4">66:4</span> All the earth will worship you, and will
sing to you; they will sing to your name." Selah.

<span id="an_66:5">66:5</span> Come, and see God's deeds-- awesome work
on behalf of the children of men.

<span id="an_66:6">66:6</span> He turned the sea into dry land. They
went through the river on foot. There, we rejoiced in him.

<span id="an_66:7">66:7</span> He rules by his might forever. His eyes
watch the nations. Don't let the rebellious rise up against him. Selah.

<span id="an_66:8">66:8</span> Praise our God, you peoples! Make the
sound of his praise heard,

<span id="an_66:9">66:9</span> who preserves our life among the living,
and doesn't allow our feet to be moved.

<span id="an_66:10">66:10</span> For you, God, have tested us. You have
refined us, as silver is refined.

<span id="an_66:11">66:11</span> You brought us into prison. You laid a
burden on our backs.

<span id="an_66:12">66:12</span> You allowed men to ride over our heads.
We went through fire and through water, but you brought us to the place
of abundance.

<span id="an_66:13">66:13</span> I will come into your temple with burnt
offerings. I will pay my vows to you,

<span id="an_66:14">66:14</span> which my lips promised, and my mouth
spoke, when I was in distress.

<span id="an_66:15">66:15</span> I will offer to you burnt offerings of
fat animals, with the offering of rams, I will offer bulls with goats.
Selah.

<span id="an_66:16">66:16</span> Come, and hear, all you who fear God. I
will declare what he has done for my soul.

<span id="an_66:17">66:17</span> I cried to him with my mouth. He was
extolled with my tongue.

<span id="an_66:18">66:18</span> If I cherished sin in my heart, the
Lord wouldn't have listened.

<span id="an_66:19">66:19</span> But most certainly, God has listened.
He has heard the voice of my prayer.

<span id="an_66:20">66:20</span> Blessed be God, who has not turned away
my prayer, nor his loving kindness from me. For the Chief Musician. With
stringed instruments. A Psalm. A song.

<span id="an_67:1">67:1</span> May God be merciful to us, bless us, and
cause his face to shine on us. Selah.

<span id="an_67:2">67:2</span> That your way may be known on earth, and
your salvation among all nations,

<span id="an_67:3">67:3</span> let the peoples praise you, God. Let all
the peoples praise you.

<span id="an_67:4">67:4</span> Oh let the nations be glad and sing for
joy, for you will judge the peoples with equity, and govern the nations
on earth. Selah.

<span id="an_67:5">67:5</span> Let the peoples praise you, God. Let all
the peoples praise you.

<span id="an_67:6">67:6</span> The earth has yielded its increase. God,
even our own God, will bless us.

<span id="an_67:7">67:7</span> God will bless us. All the ends of the
earth shall fear him. For the Chief Musician. A Psalm by David. A song.

<span id="an_68:1">68:1</span> Let God arise! Let his enemies be
scattered! Let them who hate him also flee before him.

<span id="an_68:2">68:2</span> As smoke is driven away, so drive them
away. As wax melts before the fire, so let the wicked perish at the
presence of God.

<span id="an_68:3">68:3</span> But let the righteous be glad. Let them
rejoice before God. Yes, let them rejoice with gladness.

<span id="an_68:4">68:4</span> Sing to God! Sing praises to his name!
Extol him who rides on the clouds: to Yah, his name! Rejoice before him!

<span id="an_68:5">68:5</span> A father of the fatherless, and a
defender of the widows, is God in his holy habitation.

<span id="an_68:6">68:6</span> God sets the lonely in families. He
brings out the prisoners with singing, but the rebellious dwell in a
sun-scorched land.

<span id="an_68:7">68:7</span> God, when you went forth before your
people, when you marched through the wilderness... Selah.

<span id="an_68:8">68:8</span> The earth trembled. The sky also poured
down rain at the presence of the God of Sinai-- at the presence of God,
the God of Israel.

<span id="an_68:9">68:9</span> You, God, sent a plentiful rain. You
confirmed your inheritance, when it was weary.

<span id="an_68:10">68:10</span> Your congregation lived therein. You,
God, prepared your goodness for the poor.

<span id="an_68:11">68:11</span> The Lord announced the word. The ones
who proclaim it are a great company.

<span id="an_68:12">68:12</span> "Kings of armies flee! They flee!" She
who waits at home divides the spoil,

<span id="an_68:13">68:13</span> while you sleep among the campfires,
the wings of a dove sheathed with silver, her feathers with shining
gold.

<span id="an_68:14">68:14</span> When the Almighty scattered kings in
her, it snowed on Zalmon.

<span id="an_68:15">68:15</span> The mountains of Bashan are majestic
mountains. The mountains of Bashan are rugged.

<span id="an_68:16">68:16</span> Why do you look in envy, you rugged
mountains, at the mountain where God chooses to reign? Yes, Yahweh will
dwell there forever.

<span id="an_68:17">68:17</span> The chariots of God are tens of
thousands and thousands of thousands. The Lord is among them, from
Sinai, into the sanctuary.

<span id="an_68:18">68:18</span> You have ascended on high. You have led
away captives. You have received gifts among men, yes, among the
rebellious also, that Yah God might dwell there.

<span id="an_68:19">68:19</span> Blessed be the Lord, who daily bears
our burdens, even the God who is our salvation. Selah.

<span id="an_68:20">68:20</span> God is to us a God of deliverance. To
Yahweh, the Lord, belongs escape from death.

<span id="an_68:21">68:21</span> But God will strike through the head of
his enemies, the hairy scalp of such a one as still continues in his
guiltiness.

<span id="an_68:22">68:22</span> The Lord said, "I will bring you again
from Bashan, I will bring you again from the depths of the sea;

<span id="an_68:23">68:23</span> That you may crush them, dipping your
foot in blood, that the tongues of your dogs may have their portion from
your enemies."

<span id="an_68:24">68:24</span> They have seen your processions, God,
even the processions of my God, my King, into the sanctuary.

<span id="an_68:25">68:25</span> The singers went before, the minstrels
followed after, in the midst of the ladies playing with tambourines,

<span id="an_68:26">68:26</span> "Bless God in the congregations, even
the Lord in the assembly of Israel!"

<span id="an_68:27">68:27</span> There is little Benjamin, their ruler,
the princes of Judah, their council, the princes of Zebulun, and the
princes of Naphtali.

<span id="an_68:28">68:28</span> Your God has commanded your strength.
Strengthen, God, that which you have done for us.

<span id="an_68:29">68:29</span> Because of your temple at Jerusalem,
kings shall bring presents to you.

<span id="an_68:30">68:30</span> Rebuke the wild animal of the reeds,
the multitude of the bulls, with the calves of the peoples. Being
humbled, may it bring bars of silver. Scatter the nations that delight
in war.

<span id="an_68:31">68:31</span> Princes shall come out of Egypt.
Ethiopia shall hurry to stretch out her hands to God.

<span id="an_68:32">68:32</span> Sing to God, you kingdoms of the earth!
Sing praises to the Lord! Selah.

<span id="an_68:33">68:33</span> To him who rides on the heaven of
heavens, which are of old; behold, he utters his voice, a mighty voice.

<span id="an_68:34">68:34</span> Ascribe strength to God! His excellency
is over Israel, his strength is in the skies.

<span id="an_68:35">68:35</span> You are awesome, God, in your
sanctuaries. The God of Israel gives strength and power to his people.
Praise be to God! For the Chief Musician. To the tune of "Lilies." By
David.

<span id="an_69:1">69:1</span> Save me, God, for the waters have come up
to my neck!

<span id="an_69:2">69:2</span> I sink in deep mire, where there is no
foothold. I have come into deep waters, where the floods overflow me.

<span id="an_69:3">69:3</span> I am weary with my crying. My throat is
dry. My eyes fail, looking for my God.

<span id="an_69:4">69:4</span> Those who hate me without a cause are
more than the hairs of my head. Those who want to cut me off, being my
enemies wrongfully, are mighty. I have to restore what I didn't take
away.

<span id="an_69:5">69:5</span> God, you know my foolishness. My sins
aren't hidden from you.

<span id="an_69:6">69:6</span> Don't let those who wait for you be
shamed through me, Lord Yahweh of Armies. Don't let those who seek you
be brought to dishonor through me, God of Israel.

<span id="an_69:7">69:7</span> Because for your sake, I have borne
reproach. Shame has covered my face.

<span id="an_69:8">69:8</span> I have become a stranger to my brothers,
an alien to my mother's children.

<span id="an_69:9">69:9</span> For the zeal of your house consumes me.
The reproaches of those who reproach you have fallen on me.

<span id="an_69:10">69:10</span> When I wept and I fasted, that was to
my reproach.

<span id="an_69:11">69:11</span> When I made sackcloth my clothing, I
became a byword to them.

<span id="an_69:12">69:12</span> Those who sit in the gate talk about
me. I am the song of the drunkards.

<span id="an_69:13">69:13</span> But as for me, my prayer is to you,
Yahweh, in an acceptable time. God, in the abundance of your loving
kindness, answer me in the truth of your salvation.

<span id="an_69:14">69:14</span> Deliver me out of the mire, and don't
let me sink. Let me be delivered from those who hate me, and out of the
deep waters.

<span id="an_69:15">69:15</span> Don't let the flood waters overwhelm
me, neither let the deep swallow me up. Don't let the pit shut its mouth
on me.

<span id="an_69:16">69:16</span> Answer me, Yahweh, for your loving
kindness is good. According to the multitude of your tender mercies,
turn to me.

<span id="an_69:17">69:17</span> Don't hide your face from your servant,
for I am in distress. Answer me speedily!

<span id="an_69:18">69:18</span> Draw near to my soul, and redeem it.
Ransom me because of my enemies.

<span id="an_69:19">69:19</span> You know my reproach, my shame, and my
dishonor. My adversaries are all before you.

<span id="an_69:20">69:20</span> Reproach has broken my heart, and I am
full of heaviness. I looked for some to take pity, but there was none;
for comforters, but I found none.

<span id="an_69:21">69:21</span> They also gave me gall for my food. In
my thirst, they gave me vinegar to drink.

<span id="an_69:22">69:22</span> Let their table before them become a
snare. May it become a retribution and a trap.

<span id="an_69:23">69:23</span> Let their eyes be darkened, so that
they can't see. Let their backs be continually bent.

<span id="an_69:24">69:24</span> Pour out your indignation on them. Let
the fierceness of your anger overtake them.

<span id="an_69:25">69:25</span> Let their habitation be desolate. Let
no one dwell in their tents.

<span id="an_69:26">69:26</span> For they persecute him whom you have
wounded. They tell of the sorrow of those whom you have hurt.

<span id="an_69:27">69:27</span> Charge them with crime upon crime.
Don't let them come into your righteousness.

<span id="an_69:28">69:28</span> Let them be blotted out of the book of
life, and not be written with the righteous.

<span id="an_69:29">69:29</span> But I am in pain and distress. Let your
salvation, God, protect me.

<span id="an_69:30">69:30</span> I will praise the name of God with a
song, and will magnify him with thanksgiving.

<span id="an_69:31">69:31</span> It will please Yahweh better than an
ox, or a bull that has horns and hoofs.

<span id="an_69:32">69:32</span> The humble have seen it, and are glad.
You who seek after God, let your heart live.

<span id="an_69:33">69:33</span> For Yahweh hears the needy, and doesn't
despise his captive people.

<span id="an_69:34">69:34</span> Let heaven and earth praise him; the
seas, and everything that moves therein!

<span id="an_69:35">69:35</span> For God will save Zion, and build the
cities of Judah. They shall settle there, and own it.

<span id="an_69:36">69:36</span> The children also of his servants shall
inherit it. Those who love his name shall dwell therein. For the Chief
Musician. By David. A reminder.

<span id="an_70:1">70:1</span> Hurry, God, to deliver me. Come quickly
to help me, Yahweh.

<span id="an_70:2">70:2</span> Let them be disappointed and confounded
who seek my soul. Let those who desire my ruin be turned back in
disgrace.

<span id="an_70:3">70:3</span> Let them be turned because of their shame
Who say, "Aha! Aha!"

<span id="an_70:4">70:4</span> Let all those who seek you rejoice and be
glad in you. Let those who love your salvation continually say, "Let God
be exalted!"

<span id="an_70:5">70:5</span> But I am poor and needy. Come to me
quickly, God. You are my help and my deliverer. Yahweh, don't delay.

<span id="an_71:1">71:1</span> In you, Yahweh, I take refuge. Never let
me be disappointed.

<span id="an_71:2">71:2</span> Deliver me in your righteousness, and
rescue me. Turn your ear to me, and save me.

<span id="an_71:3">71:3</span> Be to me a rock of refuge to which I may
always go. Give the command to save me, for you are my rock and my
fortress.

<span id="an_71:4">71:4</span> Rescue me, my God, from the hand of the
wicked, from the hand of the unrighteous and cruel man.

<span id="an_71:5">71:5</span> For you are my hope, Lord Yahweh; my
confidence from my youth.

<span id="an_71:6">71:6</span> I have relied on you from the womb. You
are he who took me out of my mother's womb. I will always praise you.

<span id="an_71:7">71:7</span> I am a marvel to many, but you are my
strong refuge.

<span id="an_71:8">71:8</span> My mouth shall be filled with your
praise, with your honor all the day.

<span id="an_71:9">71:9</span> Don't reject me in my old age. Don't
forsake me when my strength fails.

<span id="an_71:10">71:10</span> For my enemies talk about me. Those who
watch for my soul conspire together,

<span id="an_71:11">71:11</span> saying, "God has forsaken him. Pursue
and take him, for no one will rescue him."

<span id="an_71:12">71:12</span> God, don't be far from me. My God,
hurry to help me.

<span id="an_71:13">71:13</span> Let my accusers be disappointed and
consumed. Let them be covered with disgrace and scorn who want to harm
me.

<span id="an_71:14">71:14</span> But I will always hope, and will add to
all of your praise.

<span id="an_71:15">71:15</span> My mouth will tell about your
righteousness, and of your salvation all day, though I don't know its
full measure.

<span id="an_71:16">71:16</span> I will come with the mighty acts of the
Lord Yahweh. I will make mention of your righteousness, even of yours
alone.

<span id="an_71:17">71:17</span> God, you have taught me from my youth.
Until now, I have declared your wondrous works.

<span id="an_71:18">71:18</span> Yes, even when I am old and
gray-haired, God, don't forsake me, until I have declared your strength
to the next generation, your might to everyone who is to come.

<span id="an_71:19">71:19</span> Your righteousness also, God, reaches
to the heavens; you have done great things. God, who is like you?

<span id="an_71:20">71:20</span> You, who have shown us many and bitter
troubles, you will let me live. You will bring us up again from the
depths of the earth.

<span id="an_71:21">71:21</span> Increase my honor, and comfort me
again.

<span id="an_71:22">71:22</span> I will also praise you with the harp
for your faithfulness, my God. I sing praises to you with the lyre, Holy
One of Israel.

<span id="an_71:23">71:23</span> My lips shall shout for joy! My soul,
which you have redeemed, sings praises to you!

<span id="an_71:24">71:24</span> My tongue will also talk about your
righteousness all day long, for they are disappointed, and they are
confounded, who want to harm me. By Solomon.

<span id="an_72:1">72:1</span> God, give the king your justice; your
righteousness to the royal son.

<span id="an_72:2">72:2</span> He will judge your people with
righteousness, and your poor with justice.

<span id="an_72:3">72:3</span> The mountains shall bring prosperity to
the people. The hills bring the fruit of righteousness.

<span id="an_72:4">72:4</span> He will judge the poor of the people. He
will save the children of the needy, and will break the oppressor in
pieces.

<span id="an_72:5">72:5</span> They shall fear you while the sun
endures; and as long as the moon, throughout all generations.

<span id="an_72:6">72:6</span> He will come down like rain on the mown
grass, as showers that water the earth.

<span id="an_72:7">72:7</span> In his days, the righteous shall
flourish, and abundance of peace, until the moon is no more.

<span id="an_72:8">72:8</span> He shall have dominion also from sea to
sea, from the River to the ends of the earth.

<span id="an_72:9">72:9</span> Those who dwell in the wilderness shall
bow before him. His enemies shall lick the dust.

<span id="an_72:10">72:10</span> The kings of Tarshish and of the
islands will bring tribute. The kings of Sheba and Seba shall offer
gifts.

<span id="an_72:11">72:11</span> Yes, all kings shall fall down before
him. All nations shall serve him.

<span id="an_72:12">72:12</span> For he will deliver the needy when he
cries; the poor, who has no helper.

<span id="an_72:13">72:13</span> He will have pity on the poor and
needy. He will save the souls of the needy.

<span id="an_72:14">72:14</span> He will redeem their soul from
oppression and violence. Their blood will be precious in his sight.

<span id="an_72:15">72:15</span> They shall live, and to him shall be
given of the gold of Sheba. Men shall pray for him continually. They
shall bless him all day long.

<span id="an_72:16">72:16</span> Abundance of grain shall be throughout
the land. Its fruit sways like Lebanon. Let it flourish, thriving like
the grass of the field.

<span id="an_72:17">72:17</span> His name endures forever. His name
continues as long as the sun. Men shall be blessed by him. All nations
will call him blessed.

<span id="an_72:18">72:18</span> Praise be to Yahweh God, the God of
Israel, who alone does marvelous deeds.

<span id="an_72:19">72:19</span> Blessed be his glorious name forever!
Let the whole earth be filled with his glory! Amen and amen.

<span id="an_72:20">72:20</span> This ends the prayers by David, the son
of Jesse. BOOK III A Psalm by Asaph.

<span id="an_73:1">73:1</span> Surely God is good to Israel, to those
who are pure in heart.

<span id="an_73:2">73:2</span> But as for me, my feet were almost gone.
My steps had nearly slipped.

<span id="an_73:3">73:3</span> For I was envious of the arrogant, when I
saw the prosperity of the wicked.

<span id="an_73:4">73:4</span> For there are no struggles in their
death, but their strength is firm.

<span id="an_73:5">73:5</span> They are free from burdens of men,
neither are they plagued like other men.

<span id="an_73:6">73:6</span> Therefore pride is like a chain around
their neck. Violence covers them like a garment.

<span id="an_73:7">73:7</span> Their eyes bulge with fat. Their minds
pass the limits of conceit.

<span id="an_73:8">73:8</span> They scoff and speak with malice. In
arrogance, they threaten oppression.

<span id="an_73:9">73:9</span> They have set their mouth in the heavens.
Their tongue walks through the earth.

<span id="an_73:10">73:10</span> Therefore their people return to them,
and they drink up waters of abundance.

<span id="an_73:11">73:11</span> They say, "How does God know? Is there
knowledge in the Most High?"

<span id="an_73:12">73:12</span> Behold, these are the wicked. Being
always at ease, they increase in riches.

<span id="an_73:13">73:13</span> Surely in vain I have cleansed my
heart, and washed my hands in innocence,

<span id="an_73:14">73:14</span> For all day long have I been plagued,
and punished every morning.

<span id="an_73:15">73:15</span> If I had said, "I will speak thus;"
behold, I would have betrayed the generation of your children.

<span id="an_73:16">73:16</span> When I tried to understand this, it was
too painful for me;

<span id="an_73:17">73:17</span> Until I entered God's sanctuary, and
considered their latter end.

<span id="an_73:18">73:18</span> Surely you set them in slippery places.
You throw them down to destruction.

<span id="an_73:19">73:19</span> How they are suddenly destroyed! They
are completely swept away with terrors.

<span id="an_73:20">73:20</span> As a dream when one wakes up, so, Lord,
when you awake, you will despise their fantasies.

<span id="an_73:21">73:21</span> For my soul was grieved. I was
embittered in my heart.

<span id="an_73:22">73:22</span> I was so senseless and ignorant. I was
a brute beast before you.

<span id="an_73:23">73:23</span> Nevertheless, I am continually with
you. You have held my right hand.

<span id="an_73:24">73:24</span> You will guide me with your counsel,
and afterward receive me to glory.

<span id="an_73:25">73:25</span> Who do I have in heaven? There is no
one on earth who I desire besides you.

<span id="an_73:26">73:26</span> My flesh and my heart fails, but God is
the strength of my heart and my portion forever.

<span id="an_73:27">73:27</span> For, behold, those who are far from you
shall perish. You have destroyed all those who are unfaithful to you.

<span id="an_73:28">73:28</span> But it is good for me to come close to
God. I have made the Lord Yahweh my refuge, that I may tell of all your
works. A contemplation by Asaph.

<span id="an_74:1">74:1</span> God, why have you rejected us forever?
Why does your anger smolder against the sheep of your pasture?

<span id="an_74:2">74:2</span> Remember your congregation, which you
purchased of old, which you have redeemed to be the tribe of your
inheritance; Mount Zion, in which you have lived.

<span id="an_74:3">74:3</span> Lift up your feet to the perpetual ruins,
all the evil that the enemy has done in the sanctuary.

<span id="an_74:4">74:4</span> Your adversaries have roared in the midst
of your assembly. They have set up their standards as signs.

<span id="an_74:5">74:5</span> They behaved like men wielding axes,
cutting through a thicket of trees.

<span id="an_74:6">74:6</span> Now they break all its carved work down
with hatchet and hammers.

<span id="an_74:7">74:7</span> They have burned your sanctuary to the
ground. They have profaned the dwelling place of your Name.

<span id="an_74:8">74:8</span> They said in their heart, "We will crush
them completely." They have burned up all the places in the land where
God was worshiped.

<span id="an_74:9">74:9</span> We see no miraculous signs. There is no
longer any prophet, neither is there among us anyone who knows how long.

<span id="an_74:10">74:10</span> How long, God, shall the adversary
reproach? Shall the enemy blaspheme your name forever?

<span id="an_74:11">74:11</span> Why do you draw back your hand, even
your right hand? Take it out of your pocket and consume them!

<span id="an_74:12">74:12</span> Yet God is my King of old, working
salvation in the midst of the earth.

<span id="an_74:13">74:13</span> You divided the sea by your strength.
You broke the heads of the sea monsters in the waters.

<span id="an_74:14">74:14</span> You broke the heads of Leviathan in
pieces. You gave him as food to people and desert creatures.

<span id="an_74:15">74:15</span> You opened up spring and stream. You
dried up mighty rivers.

<span id="an_74:16">74:16</span> The day is yours, the night is also
yours. You have prepared the light and the sun.

<span id="an_74:17">74:17</span> You have set all the boundaries of the
earth. You have made summer and winter.

<span id="an_74:18">74:18</span> Remember this, that the enemy has
mocked you, Yahweh. Foolish people have blasphemed your name.

<span id="an_74:19">74:19</span> Don't deliver the soul of your dove to
wild beasts. Don't forget the life of your poor forever.

<span id="an_74:20">74:20</span> Honor your covenant, for haunts of
violence fill the dark places of the earth.

<span id="an_74:21">74:21</span> Don't let the oppressed return ashamed.
Let the poor and needy praise your name.

<span id="an_74:22">74:22</span> Arise, God! Plead your own cause.
Remember how the foolish man mocks you all day.

<span id="an_74:23">74:23</span> Don't forget the voice of your
adversaries. The tumult of those who rise up against you ascends
continually. For the Chief Musician. To the tune of "Do Not Destroy." A
Psalm by Asaph. A song.

<span id="an_75:1">75:1</span> We give thanks to you, God. We give
thanks, for your Name is near. Men tell about your wondrous works.

<span id="an_75:2">75:2</span> When I choose the appointed time, I will
judge blamelessly.

<span id="an_75:3">75:3</span> The earth and all its inhabitants quake.
I firmly hold its pillars. Selah.

<span id="an_75:4">75:4</span> I said to the arrogant, "Don't boast!" I
said to the wicked, "Don't lift up the horn.

<span id="an_75:5">75:5</span> Don't lift up your horn on high. Don't
speak with a stiff neck."

<span id="an_75:6">75:6</span> For neither from the east, nor from the
west, nor yet from the south, comes exaltation.

<span id="an_75:7">75:7</span> But God is the judge. He puts down one,
and lifts up another.

<span id="an_75:8">75:8</span> For in the hand of Yahweh there is a cup,
full of foaming wine mixed with spices. He pours it out. Indeed the
wicked of the earth drink and drink it to its very dregs.

<span id="an_75:9">75:9</span> But I will declare this forever: I will
sing praises to the God of Jacob.

<span id="an_75:10">75:10</span> I will cut off all the horns of the
wicked, but the horns of the righteous shall be lifted up. For the Chief
Musician. On stringed instruments. A Psalm by Asaph. A song.

<span id="an_76:1">76:1</span> In Judah, God is known. His name is great
in Israel.

<span id="an_76:2">76:2</span> His tabernacle is also in Salem; His
dwelling place in Zion.

<span id="an_76:3">76:3</span> There he broke the flaming arrows of the
bow, the shield, and the sword, and the weapons of war. Selah.

<span id="an_76:4">76:4</span> Glorious are you, and excellent, more
than mountains of game.

<span id="an_76:5">76:5</span> Valiant men lie plundered, they have
slept their last sleep. None of the men of war can lift their hands.

<span id="an_76:6">76:6</span> At your rebuke, God of Jacob, both
chariot and horse are cast into a deep sleep.

<span id="an_76:7">76:7</span> You, even you, are to be feared. Who can
stand in your sight when you are angry?

<span id="an_76:8">76:8</span> You pronounced judgment from heaven. The
earth feared, and was silent,

<span id="an_76:9">76:9</span> when God arose to judgment, to save all
the afflicted ones of the earth. Selah.

<span id="an_76:10">76:10</span> Surely the wrath of man praises you.
The survivors of your wrath are restrained.

<span id="an_76:11">76:11</span> Make vows to Yahweh your God, and
fulfill them! Let all of his neighbors bring presents to him who is to
be feared.

<span id="an_76:12">76:12</span> He will cut off the spirit of princes.
He is feared by the kings of the earth. For the Chief Musician. To
Jeduthun. A Psalm by Asaph.

<span id="an_77:1">77:1</span> My cry goes to God! Indeed, I cry to God
for help, and for him to listen to me.

<span id="an_77:2">77:2</span> In the day of my trouble I sought the
Lord. My hand was stretched out in the night, and didn't get tired. My
soul refused to be comforted.

<span id="an_77:3">77:3</span> I remember God, and I groan. I complain,
and my spirit is overwhelmed. Selah.

<span id="an_77:4">77:4</span> You hold my eyelids open. I am so
troubled that I can't speak.

<span id="an_77:5">77:5</span> I have considered the days of old, the
years of ancient times.

<span id="an_77:6">77:6</span> I remember my song in the night. I
consider in my own heart; my spirit diligently inquires:

<span id="an_77:7">77:7</span> "Will the Lord reject us forever? Will he
be favorable no more?

<span id="an_77:8">77:8</span> Has his loving kindness vanished forever?
Does his promise fail for generations?

<span id="an_77:9">77:9</span> Has God forgotten to be gracious? Has he,
in anger, withheld his compassion?" Selah.

<span id="an_77:10">77:10</span> Then I thought, "I will appeal to this:
the years of the right hand of the Most High."

<span id="an_77:11">77:11</span> I will remember Yah's deeds; for I will
remember your wonders of old.

<span id="an_77:12">77:12</span> I will also meditate on all your work,
and consider your doings.

<span id="an_77:13">77:13</span> Your way, God, is in the sanctuary.
What god is great like God?

<span id="an_77:14">77:14</span> You are the God who does wonders. You
have made your strength known among the peoples.

<span id="an_77:15">77:15</span> You have redeemed your people with your
arm, the sons of Jacob and Joseph. Selah.

<span id="an_77:16">77:16</span> The waters saw you, God. The waters saw
you, and they writhed. The depths also convulsed.

<span id="an_77:17">77:17</span> The clouds poured out water. The skies
resounded with thunder. Your arrows also flashed around.

<span id="an_77:18">77:18</span> The voice of your thunder was in the
whirlwind. The lightnings lit up the world. The earth trembled and
shook.

<span id="an_77:19">77:19</span> Your way was through the sea; your
paths through the great waters. Your footsteps were not known.

<span id="an_77:20">77:20</span> You led your people like a flock, by
the hand of Moses and Aaron. A contemplation by Asaph.

<span id="an_78:1">78:1</span> Hear my teaching, my people. Turn your
ears to the words of my mouth.

<span id="an_78:2">78:2</span> I will open my mouth in a parable. I will
utter dark sayings of old,

<span id="an_78:3">78:3</span> Which we have heard and known, and our
fathers have told us.

<span id="an_78:4">78:4</span> We will not hide them from their
children, telling to the generation to come the praises of Yahweh, his
strength, and his wondrous works that he has done.

<span id="an_78:5">78:5</span> For he established a testimony in Jacob,
and appointed a teaching in Israel, which he commanded our fathers, that
they should make them known to their children;

<span id="an_78:6">78:6</span> that the generation to come might know,
even the children who should be born; who should arise and tell their
children,

<span id="an_78:7">78:7</span> that they might set their hope in God,
and not forget the works of God, but keep his commandments,

<span id="an_78:8">78:8</span> and might not be as their fathers, a
stubborn and rebellious generation, a generation that didn't make their
hearts loyal, whose spirit was not steadfast with God.

<span id="an_78:9">78:9</span> The children of Ephraim, being armed and
carrying bows, turned back in the day of battle.

<span id="an_78:10">78:10</span> They didn't keep God's covenant, and
refused to walk in his law.

<span id="an_78:11">78:11</span> They forgot his doings, his wondrous
works that he had shown them.

<span id="an_78:12">78:12</span> He did marvelous things in the sight of
their fathers, in the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan.

<span id="an_78:13">78:13</span> He split the sea, and caused them to
pass through. He made the waters stand as a heap.

<span id="an_78:14">78:14</span> In the daytime he also led them with a
cloud, and all night with a light of fire.

<span id="an_78:15">78:15</span> He split rocks in the wilderness, and
gave them drink abundantly as out of the depths.

<span id="an_78:16">78:16</span> He brought streams also out of the
rock, and caused waters to run down like rivers.

<span id="an_78:17">78:17</span> Yet they still went on to sin against
him, to rebel against the Most High in the desert.

<span id="an_78:18">78:18</span> They tempted God in their heart by
asking food according to their desire.

<span id="an_78:19">78:19</span> Yes, they spoke against God. They said,
"Can God prepare a table in the wilderness?

<span id="an_78:20">78:20</span> Behold, he struck the rock, so that
waters gushed out, and streams overflowed. Can he give bread also? Will
he provide flesh for his people?"

<span id="an_78:21">78:21</span> Therefore Yahweh heard, and was angry.
A fire was kindled against Jacob, anger also went up against Israel,

<span id="an_78:22">78:22</span> because they didn't believe in God, and
didn't trust in his salvation.

<span id="an_78:23">78:23</span> Yet he commanded the skies above, and
opened the doors of heaven.

<span id="an_78:24">78:24</span> He rained down manna on them to eat,
and gave them food from the sky.

<span id="an_78:25">78:25</span> Man ate the bread of angels. He sent
them food to the full.

<span id="an_78:26">78:26</span> He caused the east wind to blow in the
sky. By his power he guided the south wind.

<span id="an_78:27">78:27</span> He rained also flesh on them as the
dust; winged birds as the sand of the seas.

<span id="an_78:28">78:28</span> He let them fall in the midst of their
camp, around their habitations.

<span id="an_78:29">78:29</span> So they ate, and were well filled. He
gave them their own desire.

<span id="an_78:30">78:30</span> They didn't turn from their cravings.
Their food was yet in their mouths,

<span id="an_78:31">78:31</span> when the anger of God went up against
them, killed some of the fattest of them, and struck down the young men
of Israel.

<span id="an_78:32">78:32</span> For all this they still sinned, and
didn't believe in his wondrous works.

<span id="an_78:33">78:33</span> Therefore he consumed their days in
vanity, and their years in terror.

<span id="an_78:34">78:34</span> When he killed them, then they inquired
after him. They returned and sought God earnestly.

<span id="an_78:35">78:35</span> They remembered that God was their
rock, the Most High God, their redeemer.

<span id="an_78:36">78:36</span> But they flattered him with their
mouth, and lied to him with their tongue.

<span id="an_78:37">78:37</span> For their heart was not right with him,
neither were they faithful in his covenant.

<span id="an_78:38">78:38</span> But he, being merciful, forgave
iniquity, and didn't destroy them. Yes, many times he turned his anger
away, and didn't stir up all his wrath.

<span id="an_78:39">78:39</span> He remembered that they were but flesh,
a wind that passes away, and doesn't come again.

<span id="an_78:40">78:40</span> How often they rebelled against him in
the wilderness, and grieved him in the desert!

<span id="an_78:41">78:41</span> They turned again and tempted God, and
provoked the Holy One of Israel.

<span id="an_78:42">78:42</span> They didn't remember his hand, nor the
day when he redeemed them from the adversary;

<span id="an_78:43">78:43</span> how he set his signs in Egypt, his
wonders in the field of Zoan,

<span id="an_78:44">78:44</span> he turned their rivers into blood, and
their streams, so that they could not drink.

<span id="an_78:45">78:45</span> He sent among them swarms of flies,
which devoured them; and frogs, which destroyed them.

<span id="an_78:46">78:46</span> He gave also their increase to the
caterpillar, and their labor to the locust.

<span id="an_78:47">78:47</span> He destroyed their vines with hail,
their sycamore fig trees with frost.

<span id="an_78:48">78:48</span> He gave over their livestock also to
the hail, and their flocks to hot thunderbolts.

<span id="an_78:49">78:49</span> He threw on them the fierceness of his
anger, wrath, indignation, and trouble, and a band of angels of evil.

<span id="an_78:50">78:50</span> He made a path for his anger. He didn't
spare their soul from death, but gave their life over to the pestilence,

<span id="an_78:51">78:51</span> and struck all the firstborn in Egypt,
the chief of their strength in the tents of Ham.

<span id="an_78:52">78:52</span> But he led forth his own people like
sheep, and guided them in the wilderness like a flock.

<span id="an_78:53">78:53</span> He led them safely, so that they
weren't afraid, but the sea overwhelmed their enemies.

<span id="an_78:54">78:54</span> He brought them to the border of his
sanctuary, to this mountain, which his right hand had taken.

<span id="an_78:55">78:55</span> He also drove out the nations before
them, allotted them for an inheritance by line, and made the tribes of
Israel to dwell in their tents.

<span id="an_78:56">78:56</span> Yet they tempted and rebelled against
the Most High God, and didn't keep his testimonies;

<span id="an_78:57">78:57</span> but turned back, and dealt
treacherously like their fathers. They were turned aside like a
deceitful bow.

<span id="an_78:58">78:58</span> For they provoked him to anger with
their high places, and moved him to jealousy with their engraved images.

<span id="an_78:59">78:59</span> When God heard this, he was angry, and
greatly abhorred Israel;

<span id="an_78:60">78:60</span> So that he forsook the tent of Shiloh,
the tent which he placed among men;

<span id="an_78:61">78:61</span> and delivered his strength into
captivity, his glory into the adversary's hand.

<span id="an_78:62">78:62</span> He also gave his people over to the
sword, and was angry with his inheritance.

<span id="an_78:63">78:63</span> Fire devoured their young men. Their
virgins had no wedding song.

<span id="an_78:64">78:64</span> Their priests fell by the sword, and
their widows couldn't weep.

<span id="an_78:65">78:65</span> Then the Lord awakened as one out of
sleep, like a mighty man who shouts by reason of wine.

<span id="an_78:66">78:66</span> He struck his adversaries backward. He
put them to a perpetual reproach.

<span id="an_78:67">78:67</span> Moreover he rejected the tent of
Joseph, and didn't choose the tribe of Ephraim,

<span id="an_78:68">78:68</span> But chose the tribe of Judah, Mount
Zion which he loved.

<span id="an_78:69">78:69</span> He built his sanctuary like the
heights, like the earth which he has established forever.

<span id="an_78:70">78:70</span> He also chose David his servant, and
took him from the sheepfolds;

<span id="an_78:71">78:71</span> from following the ewes that have their
young, he brought him to be the shepherd of Jacob, his people, and
Israel, his inheritance.

<span id="an_78:72">78:72</span> So he was their shepherd according to
the integrity of his heart, and guided them by the skillfulness of his
hands. A Psalm by Asaph.

<span id="an_79:1">79:1</span> God, the nations have come into your
inheritance. They have defiled your holy temple. They have laid
Jerusalem in heaps.

<span id="an_79:2">79:2</span> They have given the dead bodies of your
servants to be food for the birds of the sky, the flesh of your saints
to the animals of the earth.

<span id="an_79:3">79:3</span> Their blood they have shed like water
around Jerusalem. There was no one to bury them.

<span id="an_79:4">79:4</span> We have become a reproach to our
neighbors, a scoffing and derision to those who are around us.

<span id="an_79:5">79:5</span> How long, Yahweh? Will you be angry
forever? Will your jealousy burn like fire?

<span id="an_79:6">79:6</span> Pour out your wrath on the nations that
don't know you; on the kingdoms that don't call on your name;

<span id="an_79:7">79:7</span> For they have devoured Jacob, and
destroyed his homeland.

<span id="an_79:8">79:8</span> Don't hold the iniquities of our
forefathers against us. Let your tender mercies speedily meet us, for we
are in desperate need.

<span id="an_79:9">79:9</span> Help us, God of our salvation, for the
glory of your name. Deliver us, and forgive our sins, for your name's
sake.

<span id="an_79:10">79:10</span> Why should the nations say, "Where is
their God?" Let it be known among the nations, before our eyes, that
vengeance for your servants' blood is being poured out.

<span id="an_79:11">79:11</span> Let the sighing of the prisoner come
before you. According to the greatness of your power, preserve those who
are sentenced to death.

<span id="an_79:12">79:12</span> Pay back to our neighbors seven times
into their bosom their reproach with which they have reproached you,
Lord.

<span id="an_79:13">79:13</span> So we, your people and sheep of your
pasture, will give you thanks forever. We will praise you forever, to
all generations. For the Chief Musician. To the tune of "The Lilies of
the Covenant." A Psalm by Asaph.

<span id="an_80:1">80:1</span> Hear us, Shepherd of Israel, you who lead
Joseph like a flock, you who sit above the cherubim, shine forth.

<span id="an_80:2">80:2</span> Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh,
stir up your might! Come to save us!

<span id="an_80:3">80:3</span> Turn us again, God. Cause your face to
shine, and we will be saved.

<span id="an_80:4">80:4</span> Yahweh God of Armies, How long will you
be angry against the prayer of your people?

<span id="an_80:5">80:5</span> You have fed them with the bread of
tears, and given them tears to drink in large measure.

<span id="an_80:6">80:6</span> You make us a source of contention to our
neighbors. Our enemies laugh among themselves.

<span id="an_80:7">80:7</span> Turn us again, God of Armies. Cause your
face to shine, and we will be saved.

<span id="an_80:8">80:8</span> You brought a vine out of Egypt. You
drove out the nations, and planted it.

<span id="an_80:9">80:9</span> You cleared the ground for it. It took
deep root, and filled the land.

<span id="an_80:10">80:10</span> The mountains were covered with its
shadow. Its boughs were like God's cedars.

<span id="an_80:11">80:11</span> It sent out its branches to the sea,
Its shoots to the River.

<span id="an_80:12">80:12</span> Why have you broken down its walls, so
that all those who pass by the way pluck it?

<span id="an_80:13">80:13</span> The boar out of the wood ravages it.
The wild animals of the field feed on it.

<span id="an_80:14">80:14</span> Turn again, we beg you, God of Armies.
Look down from heaven, and see, and visit this vine,

<span id="an_80:15">80:15</span> the stock which your right hand
planted, the branch that you made strong for yourself.

<span id="an_80:16">80:16</span> It's burned with fire. It's cut down.
They perish at your rebuke.

<span id="an_80:17">80:17</span> Let your hand be on the man of your
right hand, on the son of man whom you made strong for yourself.

<span id="an_80:18">80:18</span> So we will not turn away from you.
Revive us, and we will call on your name.

<span id="an_80:19">80:19</span> Turn us again, Yahweh God of Armies.
Cause your face to shine, and we will be saved. For the Chief Musician.
On an instrument of Gath. By Asaph.

<span id="an_81:1">81:1</span> Sing aloud to God, our strength! Make a
joyful shout to the God of Jacob!

<span id="an_81:2">81:2</span> Raise a song, and bring here the
tambourine, the pleasant lyre with the harp.

<span id="an_81:3">81:3</span> Blow the trumpet at the New Moon, at the
full moon, on our feast day.

<span id="an_81:4">81:4</span> For it is a statute for Israel, an
ordinance of the God of Jacob.

<span id="an_81:5">81:5</span> He appointed it in Joseph for a
testimony, when he went out over the land of Egypt, I heard a language
that I didn't know.

<span id="an_81:6">81:6</span> "I removed his shoulder from the burden.
His hands were freed from the basket.

<span id="an_81:7">81:7</span> You called in trouble, and I delivered
you. I answered you in the secret place of thunder. I tested you at the
waters of Meribah." Selah.

<span id="an_81:8">81:8</span> "Hear, my people, and I will testify to
you, Israel, if you would listen to me!

<span id="an_81:9">81:9</span> There shall be no strange god in you,
neither shall you worship any foreign god.

<span id="an_81:10">81:10</span> I am Yahweh, your God, who brought you
up out of the land of Egypt. Open your mouth wide, and I will fill it.

<span id="an_81:11">81:11</span> But my people didn't listen to my
voice. Israel desired none of me.

<span id="an_81:12">81:12</span> So I let them go after the stubbornness
of their hearts, that they might walk in their own counsels.

<span id="an_81:13">81:13</span> Oh that my people would listen to me,
that Israel would walk in my ways!

<span id="an_81:14">81:14</span> I would soon subdue their enemies, and
turn my hand against their adversaries.

<span id="an_81:15">81:15</span> The haters of Yahweh would cringe
before him, and their punishment would last forever.

<span id="an_81:16">81:16</span> But he would have also fed them with
the finest of the wheat. I will satisfy you with honey out of the rock."
A Psalm by Asaph.

<span id="an_82:1">82:1</span> God presides in the great assembly. He
judges among the gods.

<span id="an_82:2">82:2</span> "How long will you judge unjustly, and
show partiality to the wicked?" Selah.

<span id="an_82:3">82:3</span> "Defend the weak, the poor, and the
fatherless. Maintain the rights of the poor and oppressed.

<span id="an_82:4">82:4</span> Rescue the weak and needy. Deliver them
out of the hand of the wicked."

<span id="an_82:5">82:5</span> They don't know, neither do they
understand. They walk back and forth in darkness. All the foundations of
the earth are shaken.

<span id="an_82:6">82:6</span> I said, "You are gods, all of you are
sons of the Most High.

<span id="an_82:7">82:7</span> Nevertheless you shall die like men, and
fall like one of the rulers."

<span id="an_82:8">82:8</span> Arise, God, judge the earth, for you
inherit all of the nations. A song. A Psalm by Asaph.

<span id="an_83:1">83:1</span> God, don't keep silent. Don't keep
silent, and don't be still, God.

<span id="an_83:2">83:2</span> For, behold, your enemies are stirred up.
Those who hate you have lifted up their heads.

<span id="an_83:3">83:3</span> They conspire with cunning against your
people. They plot against your cherished ones.

<span id="an_83:4">83:4</span> "Come," they say, "and let's destroy them
as a nation, that the name of Israel may be remembered no more."

<span id="an_83:5">83:5</span> For they have conspired together with one
mind. They form an alliance against you.

<span id="an_83:6">83:6</span> The tents of Edom and the Ishmaelites;
Moab, and the Hagrites;

<span id="an_83:7">83:7</span> Gebal, Ammon, and Amalek; Philistia with
the inhabitants of Tyre;

<span id="an_83:8">83:8</span> Assyria also is joined with them. They
have helped the children of Lot. Selah.

<span id="an_83:9">83:9</span> Do to them as you did to Midian, as to
Sisera, as to Jabin, at the river Kishon;

<span id="an_83:10">83:10</span> who perished at Endor, who became as
dung for the earth.

<span id="an_83:11">83:11</span> Make their nobles like Oreb and Zeeb;
yes, all their princes like Zebah and Zalmunna;

<span id="an_83:12">83:12</span> who said, "Let us take possession of
God's pasturelands."

<span id="an_83:13">83:13</span> My God, make them like tumbleweed; like
chaff before the wind.

<span id="an_83:14">83:14</span> As the fire that burns the forest, as
the flame that sets the mountains on fire,

<span id="an_83:15">83:15</span> so pursue them with your tempest, and
terrify them with your storm.

<span id="an_83:16">83:16</span> Fill their faces with confusion, that
they may seek your name, Yahweh.

<span id="an_83:17">83:17</span> Let them be disappointed and dismayed
forever. Yes, let them be confounded and perish;

<span id="an_83:18">83:18</span> that they may know that you alone,
whose name is Yahweh, are the Most High over all the earth. For the
Chief Musician. On an instrument of Gath. A Psalm by the sons of Korah.

<span id="an_84:1">84:1</span> How lovely are your dwellings, Yahweh of
Armies!

<span id="an_84:2">84:2</span> My soul longs, and even faints for the
courts of Yahweh. My heart and my flesh cry out for the living God.

<span id="an_84:3">84:3</span> Yes, the sparrow has found a home, and
the swallow a nest for herself, where she may have her young, near your
altars, Yahweh of Armies, my King, and my God.

<span id="an_84:4">84:4</span> Blessed are those who dwell in your
house. They are always praising you. Selah.

<span id="an_84:5">84:5</span> Blessed are those whose strength is in
you; who have set their hearts on a pilgrimage.

<span id="an_84:6">84:6</span> Passing through the valley of Weeping,
they make it a place of springs. Yes, the autumn rain covers it with
blessings.

<span id="an_84:7">84:7</span> They go from strength to strength.
Everyone of them appears before God in Zion.

<span id="an_84:8">84:8</span> Yahweh, God of Armies, hear my prayer.
Listen, God of Jacob. Selah.

<span id="an_84:9">84:9</span> Behold, God our shield, look at the face
of your anointed.

<span id="an_84:10">84:10</span> For a day in your courts is better than
a thousand. I would rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God, than
to dwell in the tents of wickedness.

<span id="an_84:11">84:11</span> For Yahweh God is a sun and a shield.
Yahweh will give grace and glory. He withholds no good thing from those
who walk blamelessly.

<span id="an_84:12">84:12</span> Yahweh of Armies, blessed is the man
who trusts in you. For the Chief Musician. A Psalm by the sons of Korah.

<span id="an_85:1">85:1</span> Yahweh, you have been favorable to your
land. You have restored the fortunes of Jacob.

<span id="an_85:2">85:2</span> You have forgiven the iniquity of your
people. You have covered all their sin. Selah.

<span id="an_85:3">85:3</span> You have taken away all your wrath. You
have turned from the fierceness of your anger.

<span id="an_85:4">85:4</span> Turn us, God of our salvation, and cause
your indignation toward us to cease.

<span id="an_85:5">85:5</span> Will you be angry with us forever? Will
you draw out your anger to all generations?

<span id="an_85:6">85:6</span> Won't you revive us again, that your
people may rejoice in you?

<span id="an_85:7">85:7</span> Show us your loving kindness, Yahweh.
Grant us your salvation.

<span id="an_85:8">85:8</span> I will hear what God, Yahweh, will speak,
for he will speak peace to his people, his saints; but let them not turn
again to folly.

<span id="an_85:9">85:9</span> Surely his salvation is near those who
fear him, that glory may dwell in our land.

<span id="an_85:10">85:10</span> Mercy and truth meet together.
Righteousness and peace have kissed each other.

<span id="an_85:11">85:11</span> Truth springs out of the earth.
Righteousness has looked down from heaven.

<span id="an_85:12">85:12</span> Yes, Yahweh will give that which is
good. Our land will yield its increase.

<span id="an_85:13">85:13</span> Righteousness goes before him, And
prepares the way for his steps. A Prayer by David.

<span id="an_86:1">86:1</span> Hear, Yahweh, and answer me, for I am
poor and needy.

<span id="an_86:2">86:2</span> Preserve my soul, for I am godly. You, my
God, save your servant who trusts in you.

<span id="an_86:3">86:3</span> Be merciful to me, Lord, for I call to
you all day long.

<span id="an_86:4">86:4</span> Bring joy to the soul of your servant,
for to you, Lord, do I lift up my soul.

<span id="an_86:5">86:5</span> For you, Lord, are good, and ready to
forgive; abundant in loving kindness to all those who call on you.

<span id="an_86:6">86:6</span> Hear, Yahweh, my prayer. Listen to the
voice of my petitions.

<span id="an_86:7">86:7</span> In the day of my trouble I will call on
you, for you will answer me.

<span id="an_86:8">86:8</span> There is no one like you among the gods,
Lord, nor any deeds like your deeds.

<span id="an_86:9">86:9</span> All nations you have made will come and
worship before you, Lord. They shall glorify your name.

<span id="an_86:10">86:10</span> For you are great, and do wondrous
things. You are God alone.

<span id="an_86:11">86:11</span> Teach me your way, Yahweh. I will walk
in your truth. Make my heart undivided to fear your name.

<span id="an_86:12">86:12</span> I will praise you, Lord my God, with my
whole heart. I will glorify your name forevermore.

<span id="an_86:13">86:13</span> For your loving kindness is great
toward me. You have delivered my soul from the lowest Sheol.

<span id="an_86:14">86:14</span> God, the proud have risen up against
me. A company of violent men have sought after my soul, and they don't
hold regard for you before them.

<span id="an_86:15">86:15</span> But you, Lord, are a merciful and
gracious God, slow to anger, and abundant in loving kindness and truth.

<span id="an_86:16">86:16</span> Turn to me, and have mercy on me! Give
your strength to your servant. Save the son of your handmaid.

<span id="an_86:17">86:17</span> Show me a sign of your goodness, that
those who hate me may see it, and be shamed, because you, Yahweh, have
helped me, and comforted me. A Psalm by the sons of Korah; a Song.

<span id="an_87:1">87:1</span> His foundation is in the holy mountains.

<span id="an_87:2">87:2</span> Yahweh loves the gates of Zion more than
all the dwellings of Jacob.

<span id="an_87:3">87:3</span> Glorious things are spoken about you,
city of God. Selah.

<span id="an_87:4">87:4</span> I will record Rahab and Babylon among
those who acknowledge me. Behold, Philistia, Tyre, and also Ethiopia:
"This one was born there."

<span id="an_87:5">87:5</span> Yes, of Zion it will be said, "This one
and that one was born in her;" the Most High himself will establish her.

<span id="an_87:6">87:6</span> Yahweh will count, when he writes up the
peoples, "This one was born there." Selah.

<span id="an_87:7">87:7</span> Those who sing as well as those who dance
say, "All my springs are in you." A Song. A Psalm by the sons of Korah.
For the Chief Musician. To the tune of "The Suffering of Affliction." A
contemplation by Heman, the Ezrahite.

<span id="an_88:1">88:1</span> Yahweh, the God of my salvation, I have
cried day and night before you.

<span id="an_88:2">88:2</span> Let my prayer enter into your presence.
Turn your ear to my cry.

<span id="an_88:3">88:3</span> For my soul is full of troubles. My life
draws near to Sheol.

<span id="an_88:4">88:4</span> I am counted among those who go down into
the pit. I am like a man who has no help,

<span id="an_88:5">88:5</span> set apart among the dead, like the slain
who lie in the grave, whom you remember no more. They are cut off from
your hand.

<span id="an_88:6">88:6</span> You have laid me in the lowest pit, in
the darkest depths.

<span id="an_88:7">88:7</span> Your wrath lies heavily on me. You have
afflicted me with all your waves. Selah.

<span id="an_88:8">88:8</span> You have taken my friends from me. You
have made me an abomination to them. I am confined, and I can't escape.

<span id="an_88:9">88:9</span> My eyes are dim from grief. I have called
on you daily, Yahweh. I have spread out my hands to you.

<span id="an_88:10">88:10</span> Do you show wonders to the dead? Do the
dead rise up and praise you? Selah.

<span id="an_88:11">88:11</span> Is your loving kindness declared in the
grave? Or your faithfulness in Destruction?

<span id="an_88:12">88:12</span> Are your wonders made known in the
dark? Or your righteousness in the land of forgetfulness?

<span id="an_88:13">88:13</span> But to you, Yahweh, I have cried. In
the morning, my prayer comes before you.

<span id="an_88:14">88:14</span> Yahweh, why do you reject my soul? Why
do you hide your face from me?

<span id="an_88:15">88:15</span> I am afflicted and ready to die from my
youth up. While I suffer your terrors, I am distracted.

<span id="an_88:16">88:16</span> Your fierce wrath has gone over me.
Your terrors have cut me off.

<span id="an_88:17">88:17</span> They came around me like water all day
long. They completely engulfed me.

<span id="an_88:18">88:18</span> You have put lover and friend far from
me, and my friends into darkness. A contemplation by Ethan, the
Ezrahite.

<span id="an_89:1">89:1</span> I will sing of the loving kindness of
Yahweh forever. With my mouth, I will make known your faithfulness to
all generations.

<span id="an_89:2">89:2</span> I indeed declare, "Love stands firm
forever. You established the heavens. Your faithfulness is in them."

<span id="an_89:3">89:3</span> "I have made a covenant with my chosen
one, I have sworn to David, my servant,

<span id="an_89:4">89:4</span> 'I will establish your seed forever, and
build up your throne to all generations.'" Selah.

<span id="an_89:5">89:5</span> The heavens will praise your wonders,
Yahweh; your faithfulness also in the assembly of the holy ones.

<span id="an_89:6">89:6</span> For who in the skies can be compared to
Yahweh? Who among the sons of the heavenly beings is like Yahweh,

<span id="an_89:7">89:7</span> a very awesome God in the council of the
holy ones, to be feared above all those who are around him?

<span id="an_89:8">89:8</span> Yahweh, God of Armies, who is a mighty
one, like you? Yah, your faithfulness is around you.

<span id="an_89:9">89:9</span> You rule the pride of the sea. When its
waves rise up, you calm them.

<span id="an_89:10">89:10</span> You have broken Rahab in pieces, like
one of the slain. You have scattered your enemies with your mighty arm.

<span id="an_89:11">89:11</span> The heavens are yours. The earth also
is yours; the world and its fullness. You have founded them.

<span id="an_89:12">89:12</span> The north and the south, you have
created them. Tabor and Hermon rejoice in your name.

<span id="an_89:13">89:13</span> You have a mighty arm. Your hand is
strong, and your right hand is exalted.

<span id="an_89:14">89:14</span> Righteousness and justice are the
foundation of your throne. Loving kindness and truth go before your
face.

<span id="an_89:15">89:15</span> Blessed are the people who learn to
acclaim you. They walk in the light of your presence, Yahweh.

<span id="an_89:16">89:16</span> In your name they rejoice all day. In
your righteousness, they are exalted.

<span id="an_89:17">89:17</span> For you are the glory of their
strength. In your favor, our horn will be exalted.

<span id="an_89:18">89:18</span> For our shield belongs to Yahweh; our
king to the Holy One of Israel.

<span id="an_89:19">89:19</span> Then you spoke in vision to your
saints, and said, "I have bestowed strength on the warrior. I have
exalted a young man from the people.

<span id="an_89:20">89:20</span> I have found David, my servant. I have
anointed him with my holy oil,

<span id="an_89:21">89:21</span> with whom my hand shall be established.
My arm will also strengthen him.

<span id="an_89:22">89:22</span> No enemy will tax him. No wicked man
will oppress him.

<span id="an_89:23">89:23</span> I will beat down his adversaries before
him, and strike those who hate him.

<span id="an_89:24">89:24</span> But my faithfulness and my loving
kindness will be with him. In my name, his horn will be exalted.

<span id="an_89:25">89:25</span> I will set his hand also on the sea,
and his right hand on the rivers.

<span id="an_89:26">89:26</span> He will call to me, 'You are my Father,
my God, and the rock of my salvation!'

<span id="an_89:27">89:27</span> I will also appoint him my firstborn,
the highest of the kings of the earth.

<span id="an_89:28">89:28</span> I will keep my loving kindness for him
forevermore. My covenant will stand firm with him.

<span id="an_89:29">89:29</span> I will also make his seed endure
forever, and his throne as the days of heaven.

<span id="an_89:30">89:30</span> If his children forsake my law, and
don't walk in my ordinances;

<span id="an_89:31">89:31</span> if they break my statutes, and don't
keep my commandments;

<span id="an_89:32">89:32</span> then I will punish their sin with the
rod, and their iniquity with stripes.

<span id="an_89:33">89:33</span> But I will not completely take my
loving kindness from him, nor allow my faithfulness to fail.

<span id="an_89:34">89:34</span> I will not break my covenant, nor alter
what my lips have uttered.

<span id="an_89:35">89:35</span> Once have I sworn by my holiness, I
will not lie to David.

<span id="an_89:36">89:36</span> His seed will endure forever, his
throne like the sun before me.

<span id="an_89:37">89:37</span> It will be established forever like the
moon, the faithful witness in the sky." Selah.

<span id="an_89:38">89:38</span> But you have rejected and spurned. You
have been angry with your anointed.

<span id="an_89:39">89:39</span> You have renounced the covenant of your
servant. You have defiled his crown in the dust.

<span id="an_89:40">89:40</span> You have broken down all his hedges.
You have brought his strongholds to ruin.

<span id="an_89:41">89:41</span> All who pass by the way rob him. He has
become a reproach to his neighbors.

<span id="an_89:42">89:42</span> You have exalted the right hand of his
adversaries. You have made all of his enemies rejoice.

<span id="an_89:43">89:43</span> Yes, you turn back the edge of his
sword, and haven't supported him in battle.

<span id="an_89:44">89:44</span> You have ended his splendor, and thrown
his throne down to the ground.

<span id="an_89:45">89:45</span> You have shortened the days of his
youth. You have covered him with shame. Selah.

<span id="an_89:46">89:46</span> How long, Yahweh? Will you hide
yourself forever? Will your wrath burn like fire?

<span id="an_89:47">89:47</span> Remember how short my time is! For what
vanity have you created all the children of men!

<span id="an_89:48">89:48</span> What man is he who shall live and not
see death, who shall deliver his soul from the power of Sheol? Selah.

<span id="an_89:49">89:49</span> Lord, where are your former loving
kindnesses, which you swore to David in your faithfulness?

<span id="an_89:50">89:50</span> Remember, Lord, the reproach of your
servants, how I bear in my heart the taunts of all the mighty peoples,

<span id="an_89:51">89:51</span> With which your enemies have mocked,
Yahweh, with which they have mocked the footsteps of your anointed one.

<span id="an_89:52">89:52</span> Blessed be Yahweh forevermore. Amen,
and Amen. BOOK IV A Prayer by Moses, the man of God.

<span id="an_90:1">90:1</span> Lord, you have been our dwelling place
for all generations.

<span id="an_90:2">90:2</span> Before the mountains were brought forth,
before you had formed the earth and the world, even from everlasting to
everlasting, you are God.

<span id="an_90:3">90:3</span> You turn man to destruction, saying,
"Return, you children of men."

<span id="an_90:4">90:4</span> For a thousand years in your sight are
just like yesterday when it is past, like a watch in the night.

<span id="an_90:5">90:5</span> You sweep them away as they sleep. In the
morning they sprout like new grass.

<span id="an_90:6">90:6</span> In the morning it sprouts and springs up.
By evening, it is withered and dry.

<span id="an_90:7">90:7</span> For we are consumed in your anger. We are
troubled in your wrath.

<span id="an_90:8">90:8</span> You have set our iniquities before you,
our secret sins in the light of your presence.

<span id="an_90:9">90:9</span> For all our days have passed away in your
wrath. We bring our years to an end as a sigh.

<span id="an_90:10">90:10</span> The days of our years are seventy, or
even by reason of strength eighty years; yet their pride is but labor
and sorrow, for it passes quickly, and we fly away.

<span id="an_90:11">90:11</span> Who knows the power of your anger, your
wrath according to the fear that is due to you?

<span id="an_90:12">90:12</span> So teach us to number our days, that we
may gain a heart of wisdom.

<span id="an_90:13">90:13</span> Relent, Yahweh! How long? Have
compassion on your servants!

<span id="an_90:14">90:14</span> Satisfy us in the morning with your
loving kindness, that we may rejoice and be glad all our days.

<span id="an_90:15">90:15</span> Make us glad for as many days as you
have afflicted us, for as many years as we have seen evil.

<span id="an_90:16">90:16</span> Let your work appear to your servants;
your glory to their children.

<span id="an_90:17">90:17</span> Let the favor of the Lord our God be on
us; establish the work of our hands for us; yes, establish the work of
our hands.

<span id="an_91:1">91:1</span> He who dwells in the secret place of the
Most High will rest in the shadow of the Almighty.

<span id="an_91:2">91:2</span> I will say of Yahweh, "He is my refuge
and my fortress; my God, in whom I trust."

<span id="an_91:3">91:3</span> For he will deliver you from the snare of
the fowler, and from the deadly pestilence.

<span id="an_91:4">91:4</span> He will cover you with his feathers.
Under his wings you will take refuge. His faithfulness is your shield
and rampart.

<span id="an_91:5">91:5</span> You shall not be afraid of the terror by
night, nor of the arrow that flies by day;

<span id="an_91:6">91:6</span> nor of the pestilence that walks in
darkness, nor of the destruction that wastes at noonday.

<span id="an_91:7">91:7</span> A thousand may fall at your side, and ten
thousand at your right hand; but it will not come near you.

<span id="an_91:8">91:8</span> You will only look with your eyes, and
see the recompense of the wicked.

<span id="an_91:9">91:9</span> Because you have made Yahweh your refuge,
and the Most High your dwelling place,

<span id="an_91:10">91:10</span> no evil shall happen to you, neither
shall any plague come near your dwelling.

<span id="an_91:11">91:11</span> For he will put his angels in charge of
you, to guard you in all your ways.

<span id="an_91:12">91:12</span> They will bear you up in their hands,
so that you won't dash your foot against a stone.

<span id="an_91:13">91:13</span> You will tread on the lion and cobra.
You will trample the young lion and the serpent underfoot.

<span id="an_91:14">91:14</span> "Because he has set his love on me,
therefore I will deliver him. I will set him on high, because he has
known my name.

<span id="an_91:15">91:15</span> He will call on me, and I will answer
him. I will be with him in trouble. I will deliver him, and honor him.

<span id="an_91:16">91:16</span> I will satisfy him with long life, and
show him my salvation." A Psalm. A song for the Sabbath day.

<span id="an_92:1">92:1</span> It is a good thing to give thanks to
Yahweh, to sing praises to your name, Most High;

<span id="an_92:2">92:2</span> to proclaim your loving kindness in the
morning, and your faithfulness every night,

<span id="an_92:3">92:3</span> with the ten-stringed lute, with the
harp, and with the melody of the lyre.

<span id="an_92:4">92:4</span> For you, Yahweh, have made me glad
through your work. I will triumph in the works of your hands.

<span id="an_92:5">92:5</span> How great are your works, Yahweh! Your
thoughts are very deep.

<span id="an_92:6">92:6</span> A senseless man doesn't know, neither
does a fool understand this:

<span id="an_92:7">92:7</span> though the wicked spring up as the grass,
and all the evildoers flourish, they will be destroyed forever.

<span id="an_92:8">92:8</span> But you, Yahweh, are on high forevermore.

<span id="an_92:9">92:9</span> For, behold, your enemies, Yahweh, for,
behold, your enemies shall perish. All the evildoers will be scattered.

<span id="an_92:10">92:10</span> But you have exalted my horn like that
of the wild ox. I am anointed with fresh oil.

<span id="an_92:11">92:11</span> My eye has also seen my enemies. My
ears have heard of the wicked enemies who rise up against me.

<span id="an_92:12">92:12</span> The righteous shall flourish like the
palm tree. He will grow like a cedar in Lebanon.

<span id="an_92:13">92:13</span> They are planted in Yahweh's house.
They will flourish in our God's courts.

<span id="an_92:14">92:14</span> They will still bring forth fruit in
old age. They will be full of sap and green,

<span id="an_92:15">92:15</span> to show that Yahweh is upright. He is
my rock, and there is no unrighteousness in him.

<span id="an_93:1">93:1</span> Yahweh reigns! He is clothed with
majesty! Yahweh is armed with strength. The world also is established.
It can't be moved.

<span id="an_93:2">93:2</span> Your throne is established from long ago.
You are from everlasting.

<span id="an_93:3">93:3</span> The floods have lifted up, Yahweh, the
floods have lifted up their voice. The floods lift up their waves.

<span id="an_93:4">93:4</span> Above the voices of many waters, the
mighty breakers of the sea, Yahweh on high is mighty.

<span id="an_93:5">93:5</span> Your statutes stand firm. Holiness adorns
your house, Yahweh, forevermore.

<span id="an_94:1">94:1</span> Yahweh, you God to whom vengeance
belongs, you God to whom vengeance belongs, shine forth.

<span id="an_94:2">94:2</span> Rise up, you judge of the earth. Pay back
the proud what they deserve.

<span id="an_94:3">94:3</span> Yahweh, how long will the wicked, how
long will the wicked triumph?

<span id="an_94:4">94:4</span> They pour out arrogant words. All the
evildoers boast.

<span id="an_94:5">94:5</span> They break your people in pieces, Yahweh,
and afflict your heritage.

<span id="an_94:6">94:6</span> They kill the widow and the alien, and
murder the fatherless.

<span id="an_94:7">94:7</span> They say, "Yah will not see, neither will
Jacob's God consider."

<span id="an_94:8">94:8</span> Consider, you senseless among the people;
you fools, when will you be wise?

<span id="an_94:9">94:9</span> He who implanted the ear, won't he hear?
He who formed the eye, won't he see?

<span id="an_94:10">94:10</span> He who disciplines the nations, won't
he punish? He who teaches man knows.

<span id="an_94:11">94:11</span> Yahweh knows the thoughts of man, that
they are futile.

<span id="an_94:12">94:12</span> Blessed is the man whom you discipline,
Yah, and teach out of your law;

<span id="an_94:13">94:13</span> that you may give him rest from the
days of adversity, until the pit is dug for the wicked.

<span id="an_94:14">94:14</span> For Yahweh won't reject his people,
neither will he forsake his inheritance.

<span id="an_94:15">94:15</span> For judgment will return to
righteousness. All the upright in heart shall follow it.

<span id="an_94:16">94:16</span> Who will rise up for me against the
wicked? Who will stand up for me against the evildoers?

<span id="an_94:17">94:17</span> Unless Yahweh had been my help, my soul
would have soon lived in silence.

<span id="an_94:18">94:18</span> When I said, "My foot is slipping!"
Your loving kindness, Yahweh, held me up.

<span id="an_94:19">94:19</span> In the multitude of my thoughts within
me, your comforts delight my soul.

<span id="an_94:20">94:20</span> Shall the throne of wickedness have
fellowship with you, which brings about mischief by statute?

<span id="an_94:21">94:21</span> They gather themselves together against
the soul of the righteous, and condemn the innocent blood.

<span id="an_94:22">94:22</span> But Yahweh has been my high tower, my
God, the rock of my refuge.

<span id="an_94:23">94:23</span> He has brought on them their own
iniquity, and will cut them off in their own wickedness. Yahweh, our
God, will cut them off.

<span id="an_95:1">95:1</span> Oh come, let's sing to Yahweh. Let's
shout aloud to the rock of our salvation!

<span id="an_95:2">95:2</span> Let's come before his presence with
thanksgiving. Let's extol him with songs!

<span id="an_95:3">95:3</span> For Yahweh is a great God, a great King
above all gods.

<span id="an_95:4">95:4</span> In his hand are the deep places of the
earth. The heights of the mountains are also his.

<span id="an_95:5">95:5</span> The sea is his, and he made it. His hands
formed the dry land.

<span id="an_95:6">95:6</span> Oh come, let's worship and bow down.
Let's kneel before Yahweh, our Maker,

<span id="an_95:7">95:7</span> for he is our God. We are the people of
his pasture, and the sheep in his care. Today, oh that you would hear
his voice!

<span id="an_95:8">95:8</span> Don't harden your heart, as at Meribah,
as in the day of Massah in the wilderness,

<span id="an_95:9">95:9</span> when your fathers tempted me, tested me,
and saw my work.

<span id="an_95:10">95:10</span> Forty long years I was grieved with
that generation, and said, "It is a people that errs in their heart.
They have not known my ways."

<span id="an_95:11">95:11</span> Therefore I swore in my wrath, "They
won't enter into my rest."

<span id="an_96:1">96:1</span> Sing to Yahweh a new song! Sing to
Yahweh, all the earth.

<span id="an_96:2">96:2</span> Sing to Yahweh! Bless his name! Proclaim
his salvation from day to day!

<span id="an_96:3">96:3</span> Declare his glory among the nations, his
marvelous works among all the peoples.

<span id="an_96:4">96:4</span> For great is Yahweh, and greatly to be
praised! He is to be feared above all gods.

<span id="an_96:5">96:5</span> For all the gods of the peoples are
idols, but Yahweh made the heavens.

<span id="an_96:6">96:6</span> Honor and majesty are before him.
Strength and beauty are in his sanctuary.

<span id="an_96:7">96:7</span> Ascribe to Yahweh, you families of
nations, ascribe to Yahweh glory and strength.

<span id="an_96:8">96:8</span> Ascribe to Yahweh the glory due to his
name. Bring an offering, and come into his courts.

<span id="an_96:9">96:9</span> Worship Yahweh in holy array. Tremble
before him, all the earth.

<span id="an_96:10">96:10</span> Say among the nations, "Yahweh reigns."
The world is also established. It can't be moved. He will judge the
peoples with equity.

<span id="an_96:11">96:11</span> Let the heavens be glad, and let the
earth rejoice. Let the sea roar, and its fullness!

<span id="an_96:12">96:12</span> Let the field and all that is in it
exult! Then all the trees of the woods shall sing for joy

<span id="an_96:13">96:13</span> before Yahweh; for he comes, for he
comes to judge the earth. He will judge the world with righteousness,
the peoples with his truth.

<span id="an_97:1">97:1</span> Yahweh reigns! Let the earth rejoice! Let
the multitude of islands be glad!

<span id="an_97:2">97:2</span> Clouds and darkness are around him.
Righteousness and justice are the foundation of his throne.

<span id="an_97:3">97:3</span> A fire goes before him, and burns up his
adversaries on every side.

<span id="an_97:4">97:4</span> His lightning lights up the world. The
earth sees, and trembles.

<span id="an_97:5">97:5</span> The mountains melt like wax at the
presence of Yahweh, at the presence of the Lord of the whole earth.

<span id="an_97:6">97:6</span> The heavens declare his righteousness.
All the peoples have seen his glory.

<span id="an_97:7">97:7</span> Let all them be shamed who serve engraved
images, who boast in their idols. Worship him, all you gods!

<span id="an_97:8">97:8</span> Zion heard and was glad. The daughters of
Judah rejoiced, because of your judgments, Yahweh.

<span id="an_97:9">97:9</span> For you, Yahweh, are most high above all
the earth. You are exalted far above all gods.

<span id="an_97:10">97:10</span> You who love Yahweh, hate evil. He
preserves the souls of his saints. He delivers them out of the hand of
the wicked.

<span id="an_97:11">97:11</span> Light is sown for the righteous, and
gladness for the upright in heart.

<span id="an_97:12">97:12</span> Be glad in Yahweh, you righteous
people! Give thanks to his holy Name. A Psalm.

<span id="an_98:1">98:1</span> Sing to Yahweh a new song, for he has
done marvelous things! His right hand, and his holy arm, have worked
salvation for him.

<span id="an_98:2">98:2</span> Yahweh has made known his salvation. He
has openly shown his righteousness in the sight of the nations.

<span id="an_98:3">98:3</span> He has remembered his loving kindness and
his faithfulness toward the house of Israel. All the ends of the earth
have seen the salvation of our God.

<span id="an_98:4">98:4</span> Make a joyful noise to Yahweh, all the
earth! Burst out and sing for joy, yes, sing praises!

<span id="an_98:5">98:5</span> Sing praises to Yahweh with the harp,
with the harp and the voice of melody.

<span id="an_98:6">98:6</span> With trumpets and sound of the ram's
horn, make a joyful noise before the King, Yahweh.

<span id="an_98:7">98:7</span> Let the sea roar with its fullness; the
world, and those who dwell therein.

<span id="an_98:8">98:8</span> Let the rivers clap their hands. Let the
mountains sing for joy together.

<span id="an_98:9">98:9</span> Let them sing before Yahweh, for he comes
to judge the earth. He will judge the world with righteousness, and the
peoples with equity.

<span id="an_99:1">99:1</span> Yahweh reigns! Let the peoples tremble.
He sits enthroned among the cherubim. Let the earth be moved.

<span id="an_99:2">99:2</span> Yahweh is great in Zion. He is high above
all the peoples.

<span id="an_99:3">99:3</span> Let them praise your great and awesome
name. He is Holy!

<span id="an_99:4">99:4</span> The King's strength also loves justice.
You do establish equity. You execute justice and righteousness in Jacob.

<span id="an_99:5">99:5</span> Exalt Yahweh our God. Worship at his
footstool. He is Holy!

<span id="an_99:6">99:6</span> Moses and Aaron were among his priests,
Samuel among those who call on his name; they called on Yahweh, and he
answered them.

<span id="an_99:7">99:7</span> He spoke to them in the pillar of cloud.
They kept his testimonies, the statute that he gave them.

<span id="an_99:8">99:8</span> You answered them, Yahweh our God. You
are a God who forgave them, although you took vengeance for their
doings.

<span id="an_99:9">99:9</span> Exalt Yahweh, our God. Worship at his
holy hill, for Yahweh, our God, is holy! A Psalm of thanksgiving.

<span id="an_100:1">100:1</span> Shout for joy to Yahweh, all you lands!

<span id="an_100:2">100:2</span> Serve Yahweh with gladness. Come before
his presence with singing.

<span id="an_100:3">100:3</span> Know that Yahweh, he is God. It is he
who has made us, and we are his. We are his people, and the sheep of his
pasture.

<span id="an_100:4">100:4</span> Enter into his gates with thanksgiving,
into his courts with praise. Give thanks to him, and bless his name.

<span id="an_100:5">100:5</span> For Yahweh is good. His loving kindness
endures forever, his faithfulness to all generations. A Psalm by David.

<span id="an_101:1">101:1</span> I will sing of loving kindness and
justice. To you, Yahweh, I will sing praises.

<span id="an_101:2">101:2</span> I will be careful to live a blameless
life. When will you come to me? I will walk within my house with a
blameless heart.

<span id="an_101:3">101:3</span> I will set no vile thing before my
eyes. I hate the deeds of faithless men. They will not cling to me.

<span id="an_101:4">101:4</span> A perverse heart will be far from me. I
will have nothing to do with evil.

<span id="an_101:5">101:5</span> I will silence whoever secretly
slanders his neighbor. I won't tolerate one who is haughty and
conceited.

<span id="an_101:6">101:6</span> My eyes will be on the faithful of the
land, that they may dwell with me. He who walks in a perfect way, he
will serve me.

<span id="an_101:7">101:7</span> He who practices deceit won't dwell
within my house. He who speaks falsehood won't be established before my
eyes.

<span id="an_101:8">101:8</span> Morning by morning, I will destroy all
the wicked of the land; to cut off all the workers of iniquity from
Yahweh's city. A Prayer of the afflicted, when he is overwhelmed and
pours out his complaint before Yahweh.

<span id="an_102:1">102:1</span> Hear my prayer, Yahweh! Let my cry come
to you.

<span id="an_102:2">102:2</span> Don't hide your face from me in the day
of my distress. Turn your ear to me. Answer me quickly in the day when I
call.

<span id="an_102:3">102:3</span> For my days consume away like smoke. My
bones are burned as a torch.

<span id="an_102:4">102:4</span> My heart is blighted like grass, and
withered, for I forget to eat my bread.

<span id="an_102:5">102:5</span> By reason of the voice of my groaning,
my bones stick to my skin.

<span id="an_102:6">102:6</span> I am like a pelican of the wilderness.
I have become as an owl of the waste places.

<span id="an_102:7">102:7</span> I watch, and have become like a sparrow
that is alone on the housetop.

<span id="an_102:8">102:8</span> My enemies reproach me all day. Those
who are mad at me use my name as a curse.

<span id="an_102:9">102:9</span> For I have eaten ashes like bread, and
mixed my drink with tears,

<span id="an_102:10">102:10</span> Because of your indignation and your
wrath, for you have taken me up, and thrown me away.

<span id="an_102:11">102:11</span> My days are like a long shadow. I
have withered like grass.

<span id="an_102:12">102:12</span> But you, Yahweh, will remain forever;
your renown endures to all generations.

<span id="an_102:13">102:13</span> You will arise and have mercy on
Zion; for it is time to have pity on her. Yes, the set time has come.

<span id="an_102:14">102:14</span> For your servants take pleasure in
her stones, and have pity on her dust.

<span id="an_102:15">102:15</span> So the nations will fear the name of
Yahweh; all the kings of the earth your glory.

<span id="an_102:16">102:16</span> For Yahweh has built up Zion. He has
appeared in his glory.

<span id="an_102:17">102:17</span> He has responded to the prayer of the
destitute, and has not despised their prayer.

<span id="an_102:18">102:18</span> This will be written for the
generation to come. A people which will be created will praise Yah.

<span id="an_102:19">102:19</span> For he has looked down from the
height of his sanctuary. From heaven, Yahweh saw the earth;

<span id="an_102:20">102:20</span> to hear the groans of the prisoner;
to free those who are condemned to death;

<span id="an_102:21">102:21</span> that men may declare the name of
Yahweh in Zion, and his praise in Jerusalem;

<span id="an_102:22">102:22</span> when the peoples are gathered
together, the kingdoms, to serve Yahweh.

<span id="an_102:23">102:23</span> He weakened my strength along the
course. He shortened my days.

<span id="an_102:24">102:24</span> I said, "My God, don't take me away
in the midst of my days. Your years are throughout all generations.

<span id="an_102:25">102:25</span> Of old, you laid the foundation of
the earth. The heavens are the work of your hands.

<span id="an_102:26">102:26</span> They will perish, but you will
endure. Yes, all of them will wear out like a garment. You will change
them like a cloak, and they will be changed.

<span id="an_102:27">102:27</span> But you are the same. Your years will
have no end.

<span id="an_102:28">102:28</span> The children of your servants will
continue. Their seed will be established before you." By David.

<span id="an_103:1">103:1</span> Praise Yahweh, my soul! All that is
within me, praise his holy name!

<span id="an_103:2">103:2</span> Praise Yahweh, my soul, and don't
forget all his benefits;

<span id="an_103:3">103:3</span> who forgives all your sins; who heals
all your diseases;

<span id="an_103:4">103:4</span> who redeems your life from destruction;
who crowns you with loving kindness and tender mercies;

<span id="an_103:5">103:5</span> who satisfies your desire with good
things, so that your youth is renewed like the eagle's.

<span id="an_103:6">103:6</span> Yahweh executes righteous acts, and
justice for all who are oppressed.

<span id="an_103:7">103:7</span> He made known his ways to Moses, his
deeds to the children of Israel.

<span id="an_103:8">103:8</span> Yahweh is merciful and gracious, slow
to anger, and abundant in loving kindness.

<span id="an_103:9">103:9</span> He will not always accuse; neither will
he stay angry forever.

<span id="an_103:10">103:10</span> He has not dealt with us according to
our sins, nor repaid us for our iniquities.

<span id="an_103:11">103:11</span> For as the heavens are high above the
earth, so great is his loving kindness toward those who fear him.

<span id="an_103:12">103:12</span> As far as the east is from the west,
so far has he removed our transgressions from us.

<span id="an_103:13">103:13</span> Like a father has compassion on his
children, so Yahweh has compassion on those who fear him.

<span id="an_103:14">103:14</span> For he knows how we are made. He
remembers that we are dust.

<span id="an_103:15">103:15</span> As for man, his days are like grass.
As a flower of the field, so he flourishes.

<span id="an_103:16">103:16</span> For the wind passes over it, and it
is gone. Its place remembers it no more.

<span id="an_103:17">103:17</span> But Yahweh's loving kindness is from
everlasting to everlasting with those who fear him, his righteousness to
children's children;

<span id="an_103:18">103:18</span> to those who keep his covenant, to
those who remember to obey his precepts.

<span id="an_103:19">103:19</span> Yahweh has established his throne in
the heavens. His kingdom rules over all.

<span id="an_103:20">103:20</span> Praise Yahweh, you angels of his, who
are mighty in strength, who fulfill his word, obeying the voice of his
word.

<span id="an_103:21">103:21</span> Praise Yahweh, all you armies of his,
you servants of his, who do his pleasure.

<span id="an_103:22">103:22</span> Praise Yahweh, all you works of his,
in all places of his dominion. Praise Yahweh, my soul!

<span id="an_104:1">104:1</span> Bless Yahweh, my soul. Yahweh, my God,
you are very great. You are clothed with honor and majesty.

<span id="an_104:2">104:2</span> He covers himself with light as with a
garment. He stretches out the heavens like a curtain.

<span id="an_104:3">104:3</span> He lays the beams of his rooms in the
waters. He makes the clouds his chariot. He walks on the wings of the
wind.

<span id="an_104:4">104:4</span> He makes his messengers winds; his
servants flames of fire.

<span id="an_104:5">104:5</span> He laid the foundations of the earth,
that it should not be moved forever.

<span id="an_104:6">104:6</span> You covered it with the deep as with a
cloak. The waters stood above the mountains.

<span id="an_104:7">104:7</span> At your rebuke they fled. At the voice
of your thunder they hurried away.

<span id="an_104:8">104:8</span> The mountains rose, the valleys sank
down, to the place which you had assigned to them.

<span id="an_104:9">104:9</span> You have set a boundary that they may
not pass over; that they don't turn again to cover the earth.

<span id="an_104:10">104:10</span> He sends forth springs into the
valleys. They run among the mountains.

<span id="an_104:11">104:11</span> They give drink to every animal of
the field. The wild donkeys quench their thirst.

<span id="an_104:12">104:12</span> The birds of the sky nest by them.
They sing among the branches.

<span id="an_104:13">104:13</span> He waters the mountains from his
rooms. The earth is filled with the fruit of your works.

<span id="an_104:14">104:14</span> He causes the grass to grow for the
livestock, and plants for man to cultivate, that he may bring forth food
out of the earth:

<span id="an_104:15">104:15</span> wine that makes glad the heart of
man, oil to make his face to shine, and bread that strengthens man's
heart.

<span id="an_104:16">104:16</span> Yahweh's trees are well watered, the
cedars of Lebanon, which he has planted;

<span id="an_104:17">104:17</span> where the birds make their nests. The
stork makes its home in the fir trees.

<span id="an_104:18">104:18</span> The high mountains are for the wild
goats. The rocks are a refuge for the rock badgers.

<span id="an_104:19">104:19</span> He appointed the moon for seasons.
The sun knows when to set.

<span id="an_104:20">104:20</span> You make darkness, and it is night,
in which all the animals of the forest prowl.

<span id="an_104:21">104:21</span> The young lions roar after their
prey, and seek their food from God.

<span id="an_104:22">104:22</span> The sun rises, and they steal away,
and lay down in their dens.

<span id="an_104:23">104:23</span> Man goes forth to his work, to his
labor until the evening.

<span id="an_104:24">104:24</span> Yahweh, how many are your works! In
wisdom have you made them all. The earth is full of your riches.

<span id="an_104:25">104:25</span> There is the sea, great and wide, in
which are innumerable living things, both small and large animals.

<span id="an_104:26">104:26</span> There the ships go, and leviathan,
whom you formed to play there.

<span id="an_104:27">104:27</span> These all wait for you, that you may
give them their food in due season.

<span id="an_104:28">104:28</span> You give to them; they gather. You
open your hand; they are satisfied with good.

<span id="an_104:29">104:29</span> You hide your face: they are
troubled; you take away their breath: they die, and return to the dust.

<span id="an_104:30">104:30</span> You send forth your Spirit: they are
created. You renew the face of the ground.

<span id="an_104:31">104:31</span> Let the glory of Yahweh endure
forever. Let Yahweh rejoice in his works.

<span id="an_104:32">104:32</span> He looks at the earth, and it
trembles. He touches the mountains, and they smoke.

<span id="an_104:33">104:33</span> I will sing to Yahweh as long as I
live. I will sing praise to my God while I have any being.

<span id="an_104:34">104:34</span> Let your meditation be sweet to him.
I will rejoice in Yahweh.

<span id="an_104:35">104:35</span> Let sinners be consumed out of the
earth. Let the wicked be no more. Bless Yahweh, my soul. Praise Yah!

<span id="an_105:1">105:1</span> Give thanks to Yahweh! Call on his
name! Make his doings known among the peoples.

<span id="an_105:2">105:2</span> Sing to him, sing praises to him! Tell
of all his marvelous works.

<span id="an_105:3">105:3</span> Glory in his holy name. Let the heart
of those who seek Yahweh rejoice.

<span id="an_105:4">105:4</span> Seek Yahweh and his strength. Seek his
face forever more.

<span id="an_105:5">105:5</span> Remember his marvelous works that he
has done; his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth,

<span id="an_105:6">105:6</span> you seed of Abraham, his servant, you
children of Jacob, his chosen ones.

<span id="an_105:7">105:7</span> He is Yahweh, our God. His judgments
are in all the earth.

<span id="an_105:8">105:8</span> He has remembered his covenant forever,
the word which he commanded to a thousand generations,

<span id="an_105:9">105:9</span> the covenant which he made with
Abraham, his oath to Isaac,

<span id="an_105:10">105:10</span> and confirmed the same to Jacob for a
statute; to Israel for an everlasting covenant,

<span id="an_105:11">105:11</span> saying, "To you I will give the land
of Canaan, the lot of your inheritance;"

<span id="an_105:12">105:12</span> when they were but a few men in
number, yes, very few, and foreigners in it.

<span id="an_105:13">105:13</span> They went about from nation to
nation, from one kingdom to another people.

<span id="an_105:14">105:14</span> He allowed no one to do them wrong.
Yes, he reproved kings for their sakes,

<span id="an_105:15">105:15</span> "Don't touch my anointed ones! Do my
prophets no harm!"

<span id="an_105:16">105:16</span> He called for a famine on the land.
He destroyed the food supplies.

<span id="an_105:17">105:17</span> He sent a man before them. Joseph was
sold for a slave.

<span id="an_105:18">105:18</span> They bruised his feet with shackles.
His neck was locked in irons,

<span id="an_105:19">105:19</span> until the time that his word
happened, and Yahweh's word proved him true.

<span id="an_105:20">105:20</span> The king sent and freed him; even the
ruler of peoples, and let him go free.

<span id="an_105:21">105:21</span> He made him lord of his house, and
ruler of all of his possessions;

<span id="an_105:22">105:22</span> to discipline his princes at his
pleasure, and to teach his elders wisdom.

<span id="an_105:23">105:23</span> Israel also came into Egypt. Jacob
lived in the land of Ham.

<span id="an_105:24">105:24</span> He increased his people greatly, and
made them stronger than their adversaries.

<span id="an_105:25">105:25</span> He turned their heart to hate his
people, to conspire against his servants.

<span id="an_105:26">105:26</span> He sent Moses, his servant, and
Aaron, whom he had chosen.

<span id="an_105:27">105:27</span> They performed miracles among them,
and wonders in the land of Ham.

<span id="an_105:28">105:28</span> He sent darkness, and made it dark.
They didn't rebel against his words.

<span id="an_105:29">105:29</span> He turned their waters into blood,
and killed their fish.

<span id="an_105:30">105:30</span> Their land swarmed with frogs, even
in the rooms of their kings.

<span id="an_105:31">105:31</span> He spoke, and swarms of flies came,
and lice in all their borders.

<span id="an_105:32">105:32</span> He gave them hail for rain, with
lightning in their land.

<span id="an_105:33">105:33</span> He struck their vines and also their
fig trees, and shattered the trees of their country.

<span id="an_105:34">105:34</span> He spoke, and the locusts came, and
the grasshoppers, without number,

<span id="an_105:35">105:35</span> ate up every plant in their land; and
ate up the fruit of their ground.

<span id="an_105:36">105:36</span> He struck also all the firstborn in
their land, the first fruits of all their manhood.

<span id="an_105:37">105:37</span> He brought them forth with silver and
gold. There was not one feeble person among his tribes.

<span id="an_105:38">105:38</span> Egypt was glad when they departed,
for the fear of them had fallen on them.

<span id="an_105:39">105:39</span> He spread a cloud for a covering,
fire to give light in the night.

<span id="an_105:40">105:40</span> They asked, and he brought quails,
and satisfied them with the bread of the sky.

<span id="an_105:41">105:41</span> He opened the rock, and waters gushed
out. They ran as a river in the dry places.

<span id="an_105:42">105:42</span> For he remembered his holy word, and
Abraham, his servant.

<span id="an_105:43">105:43</span> He brought forth his people with joy,
his chosen with singing.

<span id="an_105:44">105:44</span> He gave them the lands of the
nations. They took the labor of the peoples in possession,

<span id="an_105:45">105:45</span> that they might keep his statutes,
and observe his laws. Praise Yah!

<span id="an_106:1">106:1</span> Praise Yahweh! Give thanks to Yahweh,
for he is good, for his loving kindness endures forever.

<span id="an_106:2">106:2</span> Who can utter the mighty acts of
Yahweh, or fully declare all his praise?

<span id="an_106:3">106:3</span> Blessed are those who keep justice.
Blessed is one who does what is right at all times.

<span id="an_106:4">106:4</span> Remember me, Yahweh, with the favor
that you show to your people. Visit me with your salvation,

<span id="an_106:5">106:5</span> that I may see the prosperity of your
chosen, that I may rejoice in the gladness of your nation, that I may
glory with your inheritance.

<span id="an_106:6">106:6</span> We have sinned with our fathers. We
have committed iniquity. We have done wickedly.

<span id="an_106:7">106:7</span> Our fathers didn't understand your
wonders in Egypt. They didn't remember the multitude of your loving
kindnesses, but were rebellious at the sea, even at the Red Sea.

<span id="an_106:8">106:8</span> Nevertheless he saved them for his
name's sake, that he might make his mighty power known.

<span id="an_106:9">106:9</span> He rebuked the Red Sea also, and it was
dried up; so he led them through the depths, as through a desert.

<span id="an_106:10">106:10</span> He saved them from the hand of him
who hated them, and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.

<span id="an_106:11">106:11</span> The waters covered their adversaries.
There was not one of them left.

<span id="an_106:12">106:12</span> Then they believed his words. They
sang his praise.

<span id="an_106:13">106:13</span> They soon forgot his works. They
didn't wait for his counsel,

<span id="an_106:14">106:14</span> but gave in to craving in the desert,
and tested God in the wasteland.

<span id="an_106:15">106:15</span> He gave them their request, but sent
leanness into their soul.

<span id="an_106:16">106:16</span> They envied Moses also in the camp,
and Aaron, Yahweh's saint.

<span id="an_106:17">106:17</span> The earth opened and swallowed up
Dathan, and covered the company of Abiram.

<span id="an_106:18">106:18</span> A fire was kindled in their company.
The flame burned up the wicked.

<span id="an_106:19">106:19</span> They made a calf in Horeb, and
worshiped a molten image.

<span id="an_106:20">106:20</span> Thus they exchanged their glory for
an image of a bull that eats grass.

<span id="an_106:21">106:21</span> They forgot God, their Savior, who
had done great things in Egypt,

<span id="an_106:22">106:22</span> Wondrous works in the land of Ham,
and awesome things by the Red Sea.

<span id="an_106:23">106:23</span> Therefore he said that he would
destroy them, had Moses, his chosen, not stood before him in the breach,
to turn away his wrath, so that he wouldn't destroy them.

<span id="an_106:24">106:24</span> Yes, they despised the pleasant land.
They didn't believe his word,

<span id="an_106:25">106:25</span> but murmured in their tents, and
didn't listen to Yahweh's voice.

<span id="an_106:26">106:26</span> Therefore he swore to them that he
would overthrow them in the wilderness,

<span id="an_106:27">106:27</span> that he would overthrow their seed
among the nations, and scatter them in the lands.

<span id="an_106:28">106:28</span> They joined themselves also to Baal
Peor, and ate the sacrifices of the dead.

<span id="an_106:29">106:29</span> Thus they provoked him to anger with
their deeds. The plague broke in on them.

<span id="an_106:30">106:30</span> Then Phinehas stood up, and executed
judgment, so the plague was stopped.

<span id="an_106:31">106:31</span> That was credited to him for
righteousness, for all generations to come.

<span id="an_106:32">106:32</span> They angered him also at the waters
of Meribah, so that Moses was troubled for their sakes;

<span id="an_106:33">106:33</span> because they were rebellious against
his spirit, he spoke rashly with his lips.

<span id="an_106:34">106:34</span> They didn't destroy the peoples, as
Yahweh commanded them,

<span id="an_106:35">106:35</span> but mixed themselves with the
nations, and learned their works.

<span id="an_106:36">106:36</span> They served their idols, which became
a snare to them.

<span id="an_106:37">106:37</span> Yes, they sacrificed their sons and
their daughters to demons.

<span id="an_106:38">106:38</span> They shed innocent blood, even the
blood of their sons and of their daughters, whom they sacrificed to the
idols of Canaan. The land was polluted with blood.

<span id="an_106:39">106:39</span> Thus were they defiled with their
works, and prostituted themselves in their deeds.

<span id="an_106:40">106:40</span> Therefore Yahweh burned with anger
against his people. He abhorred his inheritance.

<span id="an_106:41">106:41</span> He gave them into the hand of the
nations. Those who hated them ruled over them.

<span id="an_106:42">106:42</span> Their enemies also oppressed them.
They were brought into subjection under their hand.

<span id="an_106:43">106:43</span> Many times he delivered them, but
they were rebellious in their counsel, and were brought low in their
iniquity.

<span id="an_106:44">106:44</span> Nevertheless he regarded their
distress, when he heard their cry.

<span id="an_106:45">106:45</span> He remembered for them his covenant,
and repented according to the multitude of his loving kindnesses.

<span id="an_106:46">106:46</span> He made them also to be pitied by all
those who carried them captive.

<span id="an_106:47">106:47</span> Save us, Yahweh, our God, gather us
from among the nations, to give thanks to your holy name, to triumph in
your praise!

<span id="an_106:48">106:48</span> Blessed be Yahweh, the God of Israel,
from everlasting even to everlasting! Let all the people say, "Amen."
Praise Yah! BOOK V

<span id="an_107:1">107:1</span> Give thanks to Yahweh, for he is good,
for his loving kindness endures forever.

<span id="an_107:2">107:2</span> Let the redeemed by Yahweh say so, whom
he has redeemed from the hand of the adversary,

<span id="an_107:3">107:3</span> And gathered out of the lands, from the
east and from the west, from the north and from the south.

<span id="an_107:4">107:4</span> They wandered in the wilderness in a
desert way. They found no city to live in.

<span id="an_107:5">107:5</span> Hungry and thirsty, their soul fainted
in them.

<span id="an_107:6">107:6</span> Then they cried to Yahweh in their
trouble, and he delivered them out of their distresses,

<span id="an_107:7">107:7</span> he led them also by a straight way,
that they might go to a city to live in.

<span id="an_107:8">107:8</span> Let them praise Yahweh for his loving
kindness, for his wonderful works to the children of men!

<span id="an_107:9">107:9</span> For he satisfies the longing soul. He
fills the hungry soul with good.

<span id="an_107:10">107:10</span> Some sat in darkness and in the
shadow of death, being bound in affliction and iron,

<span id="an_107:11">107:11</span> because they rebelled against the
words of God, and condemned the counsel of the Most High.

<span id="an_107:12">107:12</span> Therefore he brought down their heart
with labor. They fell down, and there was none to help.

<span id="an_107:13">107:13</span> Then they cried to Yahweh in their
trouble, and he saved them out of their distresses.

<span id="an_107:14">107:14</span> He brought them out of darkness and
the shadow of death, and broke their bonds in sunder.

<span id="an_107:15">107:15</span> Let them praise Yahweh for his loving
kindness, for his wonderful works to the children of men!

<span id="an_107:16">107:16</span> For he has broken the gates of brass,
and cut through bars of iron.

<span id="an_107:17">107:17</span> Fools are afflicted because of their
disobedience, and because of their iniquities.

<span id="an_107:18">107:18</span> Their soul abhors all kinds of food.
They draw near to the gates of death.

<span id="an_107:19">107:19</span> Then they cry to Yahweh in their
trouble, he saves them out of their distresses.

<span id="an_107:20">107:20</span> He sends his word, and heals them,
and delivers them from their graves.

<span id="an_107:21">107:21</span> Let them praise Yahweh for his loving
kindness, for his wonderful works to the children of men!

<span id="an_107:22">107:22</span> Let them offer the sacrifices of
thanksgiving, and declare his works with singing.

<span id="an_107:23">107:23</span> Those who go down to the sea in
ships, who do business in great waters;

<span id="an_107:24">107:24</span> These see Yahweh's works, and his
wonders in the deep.

<span id="an_107:25">107:25</span> For he commands, and raises the
stormy wind, which lifts up its waves.

<span id="an_107:26">107:26</span> They mount up to the sky; they go
down again to the depths. Their soul melts away because of trouble.

<span id="an_107:27">107:27</span> They reel back and forth, and stagger
like a drunken man, and are at their wits' end.

<span id="an_107:28">107:28</span> Then they cry to Yahweh in their
trouble, and he brings them out of their distress.

<span id="an_107:29">107:29</span> He makes the storm a calm, so that
its waves are still.

<span id="an_107:30">107:30</span> Then they are glad because it is
calm, so he brings them to their desired haven.

<span id="an_107:31">107:31</span> Let them praise Yahweh for his loving
kindness, for his wonderful works for the children of men!

<span id="an_107:32">107:32</span> Let them exalt him also in the
assembly of the people, and praise him in the seat of the elders.

<span id="an_107:33">107:33</span> He turns rivers into a desert, water
springs into a thirsty ground,

<span id="an_107:34">107:34</span> and a fruitful land into a salt
waste, for the wickedness of those who dwell in it.

<span id="an_107:35">107:35</span> He turns a desert into a pool of
water, and a dry land into water springs.

<span id="an_107:36">107:36</span> There he makes the hungry live, that
they may prepare a city to live in,

<span id="an_107:37">107:37</span> sow fields, plant vineyards, and reap
the fruits of increase.

<span id="an_107:38">107:38</span> He blesses them also, so that they
are multiplied greatly. He doesn't allow their livestock to decrease.

<span id="an_107:39">107:39</span> Again, they are diminished and bowed
down through oppression, trouble, and sorrow.

<span id="an_107:40">107:40</span> He pours contempt on princes, and
causes them to wander in a trackless waste.

<span id="an_107:41">107:41</span> Yet he lifts the needy out of their
affliction, and increases their families like a flock.

<span id="an_107:42">107:42</span> The upright will see it, and be glad.
All the wicked will shut their mouths.

<span id="an_107:43">107:43</span> Whoever is wise will pay attention to
these things. They will consider the loving kindnesses of Yahweh. A
Song. A Psalm by David.

<span id="an_108:1">108:1</span> My heart is steadfast, God. I will sing
and I will make music with my soul.

<span id="an_108:2">108:2</span> Wake up, harp and lyre! I will wake up
the dawn.

<span id="an_108:3">108:3</span> I will give thanks to you, Yahweh,
among the nations. I will sing praises to you among the peoples.

<span id="an_108:4">108:4</span> For your loving kindness is great above
the heavens. Your faithfulness reaches to the skies.

<span id="an_108:5">108:5</span> Be exalted, God, above the heavens! Let
your glory be over all the earth.

<span id="an_108:6">108:6</span> That your beloved may be delivered,
save with your right hand, and answer us.

<span id="an_108:7">108:7</span> God has spoken from his sanctuary: "In
triumph, I will divide Shechem, and measure out the valley of Succoth.

<span id="an_108:8">108:8</span> Gilead is mine. Manasseh is mine.
Ephraim also is my helmet. Judah is my scepter.

<span id="an_108:9">108:9</span> Moab is my wash pot. I will toss my
sandal on Edom. I will shout over Philistia."

<span id="an_108:10">108:10</span> Who will bring me into the fortified
city? Who has led me to Edom?

<span id="an_108:11">108:11</span> Haven't you rejected us, God? You
don't go forth, God, with our armies.

<span id="an_108:12">108:12</span> Give us help against the enemy, for
the help of man is vain.

<span id="an_108:13">108:13</span> Through God, we will do valiantly.
For it is he who will tread down our enemies. For the Chief Musician. A
Psalm by David.

<span id="an_109:1">109:1</span> God of my praise, don't remain silent,

<span id="an_109:2">109:2</span> for they have opened the mouth of the
wicked and the mouth of deceit against me. They have spoken to me with a
lying tongue.

<span id="an_109:3">109:3</span> They have also surrounded me with words
of hatred, and fought against me without a cause.

<span id="an_109:4">109:4</span> In return for my love, they are my
adversaries; but I am in prayer.

<span id="an_109:5">109:5</span> They have rewarded me evil for good,
and hatred for my love.

<span id="an_109:6">109:6</span> Set a wicked man over him. Let an
adversary stand at his right hand.

<span id="an_109:7">109:7</span> When he is judged, let him come forth
guilty. Let his prayer be turned into sin.

<span id="an_109:8">109:8</span> Let his days be few. Let another take
his office.

<span id="an_109:9">109:9</span> Let his children be fatherless, and his
wife a widow.

<span id="an_109:10">109:10</span> Let his children be wandering
beggars. Let them be sought from their ruins.

<span id="an_109:11">109:11</span> Let the creditor seize all that he
has. Let strangers plunder the fruit of his labor.

<span id="an_109:12">109:12</span> Let there be none to extend kindness
to him, neither let there be any to have pity on his fatherless
children.

<span id="an_109:13">109:13</span> Let his posterity be cut off. In the
generation following let their name be blotted out.

<span id="an_109:14">109:14</span> Let the iniquity of his fathers be
remembered by Yahweh. Don't let the sin of his mother be blotted out.

<span id="an_109:15">109:15</span> Let them be before Yahweh
continually, that he may cut off the memory of them from the earth;

<span id="an_109:16">109:16</span> because he didn't remember to show
kindness, but persecuted the poor and needy man, the broken in heart, to
kill them.

<span id="an_109:17">109:17</span> Yes, he loved cursing, and it came to
him. He didn't delight in blessing, and it was far from him.

<span id="an_109:18">109:18</span> He clothed himself also with cursing
as with his garment. It came into his inward parts like water, like oil
into his bones.

<span id="an_109:19">109:19</span> Let it be to him as the clothing with
which he covers himself, for the belt that is always around him.

<span id="an_109:20">109:20</span> This is the reward of my adversaries
from Yahweh, of those who speak evil against my soul.

<span id="an_109:21">109:21</span> But deal with me, Yahweh the Lord,
for your name's sake, because your loving kindness is good, deliver me;

<span id="an_109:22">109:22</span> for I am poor and needy. My heart is
wounded within me.

<span id="an_109:23">109:23</span> I fade away like an evening shadow. I
am shaken off like a locust.

<span id="an_109:24">109:24</span> My knees are weak through fasting. My
body is thin and lacks fat.

<span id="an_109:25">109:25</span> I have also become a reproach to
them. When they see me, they shake their head.

<span id="an_109:26">109:26</span> Help me, Yahweh, my God. Save me
according to your loving kindness;

<span id="an_109:27">109:27</span> that they may know that this is your
hand; that you, Yahweh, have done it.

<span id="an_109:28">109:28</span> They may curse, but you bless. When
they arise, they will be shamed, but your servant shall rejoice.

<span id="an_109:29">109:29</span> Let my adversaries be clothed with
dishonor. Let them cover themselves with their own shame as with a robe.

<span id="an_109:30">109:30</span> I will give great thanks to Yahweh
with my mouth. Yes, I will praise him among the multitude.

<span id="an_109:31">109:31</span> For he will stand at the right hand
of the needy, to save him from those who judge his soul. A Psalm by
David.

<span id="an_110:1">110:1</span> Yahweh says to my Lord, "Sit at my
right hand, until I make your enemies your footstool for your feet."

<span id="an_110:2">110:2</span> Yahweh will send forth the rod of your
strength out of Zion. Rule in the midst of your enemies.

<span id="an_110:3">110:3</span> Your people offer themselves willingly
in the day of your power, in holy array. Out of the womb of the morning,
you have the dew of your youth.

<span id="an_110:4">110:4</span> Yahweh has sworn, and will not change
his mind: "You are a priest forever in the order of Melchizedek."

<span id="an_110:5">110:5</span> The Lord is at your right hand. He will
crush kings in the day of his wrath.

<span id="an_110:6">110:6</span> He will judge among the nations. He
will heap up dead bodies. He will crush the ruler of the whole earth.

<span id="an_110:7">110:7</span> He will drink of the brook in the way;
therefore he will lift up his head.

<span id="an_111:1">111:1</span> Praise Yah! I will give thanks to
Yahweh with my whole heart, in the council of the upright, and in the
congregation.

<span id="an_111:2">111:2</span> Yahweh's works are great, pondered by
all those who delight in them.

<span id="an_111:3">111:3</span> His work is honor and majesty. His
righteousness endures forever.

<span id="an_111:4">111:4</span> He has caused his wonderful works to be
remembered. Yahweh is gracious and merciful.

<span id="an_111:5">111:5</span> He has given food to those who fear
him. He always remembers his covenant.

<span id="an_111:6">111:6</span> He has shown his people the power of
his works, in giving them the heritage of the nations.

<span id="an_111:7">111:7</span> The works of his hands are truth and
justice. All his precepts are sure.

<span id="an_111:8">111:8</span> They are established forever and ever.
They are done in truth and uprightness.

<span id="an_111:9">111:9</span> He has sent redemption to his people.
He has ordained his covenant forever. His name is holy and awesome!

<span id="an_111:10">111:10</span> The fear of Yahweh is the beginning
of wisdom. All those who do his work have a good understanding. His
praise endures forever!

<span id="an_112:1">112:1</span> Praise Yah! Blessed is the man who
fears Yahweh, who delights greatly in his commandments.

<span id="an_112:2">112:2</span> His seed will be mighty in the land.
The generation of the upright will be blessed.

<span id="an_112:3">112:3</span> Wealth and riches are in his house. His
righteousness endures forever.

<span id="an_112:4">112:4</span> Light dawns in the darkness for the
upright, gracious, merciful, and righteous.

<span id="an_112:5">112:5</span> It is well with the man who deals
graciously and lends. He will maintain his cause in judgment.

<span id="an_112:6">112:6</span> For he will never be shaken. The
righteous will be remembered forever.

<span id="an_112:7">112:7</span> He will not be afraid of evil news. His
heart is steadfast, trusting in Yahweh.

<span id="an_112:8">112:8</span> His heart is established. He will not
be afraid in the end when he sees his adversaries.

<span id="an_112:9">112:9</span> He has dispersed, he has given to the
poor. His righteousness endures forever. His horn will be exalted with
honor.

<span id="an_112:10">112:10</span> The wicked will see it, and be
grieved. He shall gnash with his teeth, and melt away. The desire of the
wicked will perish.

<span id="an_113:1">113:1</span> Praise Yah! Praise, you servants of
Yahweh, praise the name of Yahweh.

<span id="an_113:2">113:2</span> Blessed be the name of Yahweh, from
this time forth and forevermore.

<span id="an_113:3">113:3</span> From the rising of the sun to the going
down of the same, Yahweh's name is to be praised.

<span id="an_113:4">113:4</span> Yahweh is high above all nations, his
glory above the heavens.

<span id="an_113:5">113:5</span> Who is like Yahweh, our God, who has
his seat on high,

<span id="an_113:6">113:6</span> Who stoops down to see in heaven and in
the earth?

<span id="an_113:7">113:7</span> He raises up the poor out of the dust.
Lifts up the needy from the ash heap;

<span id="an_113:8">113:8</span> that he may set him with princes, even
with the princes of his people.

<span id="an_113:9">113:9</span> He settles the barren woman in her
home, as a joyful mother of children. Praise Yah!

<span id="an_114:1">114:1</span> When Israel went forth out of Egypt,
the house of Jacob from a people of foreign language;

<span id="an_114:2">114:2</span> Judah became his sanctuary, Israel his
dominion.

<span id="an_114:3">114:3</span> The sea saw it, and fled. The Jordan
was driven back.

<span id="an_114:4">114:4</span> The mountains skipped like rams, the
little hills like lambs.

<span id="an_114:5">114:5</span> What was it, you sea, that you fled?
You Jordan, that you turned back?

<span id="an_114:6">114:6</span> You mountains, that you skipped like
rams; you little hills, like lambs?

<span id="an_114:7">114:7</span> Tremble, you earth, at the presence of
the Lord, at the presence of the God of Jacob,

<span id="an_114:8">114:8</span> who turned the rock into a pool of
water, the flint into a spring of waters.

<span id="an_115:1">115:1</span> Not to us, Yahweh, not to us, but to
your name give glory, for your loving kindness, and for your truth's
sake.

<span id="an_115:2">115:2</span> Why should the nations say, "Where is
their God, now?"

<span id="an_115:3">115:3</span> But our God is in the heavens. He does
whatever he pleases.

<span id="an_115:4">115:4</span> Their idols are silver and gold, the
work of men's hands.

<span id="an_115:5">115:5</span> They have mouths, but they don't speak.
They have eyes, but they don't see.

<span id="an_115:6">115:6</span> They have ears, but they don't hear.
They have noses, but they don't smell.

<span id="an_115:7">115:7</span> They have hands, but they don't feel.
They have feet, but they don't walk, neither do they speak through their
throat.

<span id="an_115:8">115:8</span> Those who make them will be like them;
yes, everyone who trusts in them.

<span id="an_115:9">115:9</span> Israel, trust in Yahweh! He is their
help and their shield.

<span id="an_115:10">115:10</span> House of Aaron, trust in Yahweh! He
is their help and their shield.

<span id="an_115:11">115:11</span> You who fear Yahweh, trust in Yahweh!
He is their help and their shield.

<span id="an_115:12">115:12</span> Yahweh remembers us. He will bless
us. He will bless the house of Israel. He will bless the house of Aaron.

<span id="an_115:13">115:13</span> He will bless those who fear Yahweh,
both small and great.

<span id="an_115:14">115:14</span> May Yahweh increase you more and
more, you and your children.

<span id="an_115:15">115:15</span> Blessed are you by Yahweh, who made
heaven and earth.

<span id="an_115:16">115:16</span> The heavens are the heavens of
Yahweh; but the earth has he given to the children of men.

<span id="an_115:17">115:17</span> The dead don't praise Yah, neither
any who go down into silence;

<span id="an_115:18">115:18</span> But we will bless Yah, from this time
forth and forevermore. Praise Yah!

<span id="an_116:1">116:1</span> I love Yahweh, because he listens to my
voice, and my cries for mercy.

<span id="an_116:2">116:2</span> Because he has turned his ear to me,
therefore I will call on him as long as I live.

<span id="an_116:3">116:3</span> The cords of death surrounded me, the
pains of Sheol got a hold of me. I found trouble and sorrow.

<span id="an_116:4">116:4</span> Then I called on the name of Yahweh:
"Yahweh, I beg you, deliver my soul."

<span id="an_116:5">116:5</span> Yahweh is Gracious and righteous. Yes,
our God is merciful.

<span id="an_116:6">116:6</span> Yahweh preserves the simple. I was
brought low, and he saved me.

<span id="an_116:7">116:7</span> Return to your rest, my soul, for
Yahweh has dealt bountifully with you.

<span id="an_116:8">116:8</span> For you have delivered my soul from
death, my eyes from tears, and my feet from falling.

<span id="an_116:9">116:9</span> I will walk before Yahweh in the land
of the living.

<span id="an_116:10">116:10</span> I believed, therefore I said, "I was
greatly afflicted."

<span id="an_116:11">116:11</span> I said in my haste, "All men are
liars."

<span id="an_116:12">116:12</span> What will I give to Yahweh for all
his benefits toward me?

<span id="an_116:13">116:13</span> I will take the cup of salvation, and
call on the name of Yahweh.

<span id="an_116:14">116:14</span> I will pay my vows to Yahweh, yes, in
the presence of all his people.

<span id="an_116:15">116:15</span> Precious in the sight of Yahweh is
the death of his saints.

<span id="an_116:16">116:16</span> Yahweh, truly I am your servant. I am
your servant, the son of your handmaid. You have freed me from my
chains.

<span id="an_116:17">116:17</span> I will offer to you the sacrifice of
thanksgiving, and will call on the name of Yahweh.

<span id="an_116:18">116:18</span> I will pay my vows to Yahweh, yes, in
the presence of all his people,

<span id="an_116:19">116:19</span> in the courts of Yahweh's house, in
the midst of you, Jerusalem. Praise Yah!

<span id="an_117:1">117:1</span> Praise Yahweh, all you nations! Extol
him, all you peoples!

<span id="an_117:2">117:2</span> For his loving kindness is great toward
us. Yahweh's faithfulness endures forever. Praise Yah!

<span id="an_118:1">118:1</span> Give thanks to Yahweh, for he is good,
for his loving kindness endures forever.

<span id="an_118:2">118:2</span> Let Israel now say that his loving
kindness endures forever.

<span id="an_118:3">118:3</span> Let the house of Aaron now say that his
loving kindness endures forever.

<span id="an_118:4">118:4</span> Now let those who fear Yahweh say that
his loving kindness endures forever.

<span id="an_118:5">118:5</span> Out of my distress, I called on Yah.
Yah answered me with freedom.

<span id="an_118:6">118:6</span> Yahweh is on my side. I will not be
afraid. What can man do to me?

<span id="an_118:7">118:7</span> Yahweh is on my side among those who
help me. Therefore I will look in triumph at those who hate me.

<span id="an_118:8">118:8</span> It is better to take refuge in Yahweh,
than to put confidence in man.

<span id="an_118:9">118:9</span> It is better to take refuge in Yahweh,
than to put confidence in princes.

<span id="an_118:10">118:10</span> All the nations surrounded me, but in
the name of Yahweh, I cut them off.

<span id="an_118:11">118:11</span> They surrounded me, yes, they
surrounded me. In the name of Yahweh I indeed cut them off.

<span id="an_118:12">118:12</span> They surrounded me like bees. They
are quenched like the burning thorns. In the name of Yahweh I cut them
off.

<span id="an_118:13">118:13</span> You pushed me back hard, to make me
fall, but Yahweh helped me.

<span id="an_118:14">118:14</span> Yah is my strength and song. He has
become my salvation.

<span id="an_118:15">118:15</span> The voice of rejoicing and salvation
is in the tents of the righteous. "The right hand of Yahweh does
valiantly.

<span id="an_118:16">118:16</span> The right hand of Yahweh is exalted!
The right hand of Yahweh does valiantly!"

<span id="an_118:17">118:17</span> I will not die, but live, and declare
Yah's works.

<span id="an_118:18">118:18</span> Yah has punished me severely, but he
has not given me over to death.

<span id="an_118:19">118:19</span> Open to me the gates of
righteousness. I will enter into them. I will give thanks to Yah.

sheep. Seek your servant, for I don't forget your commandments. A Song
of Ascents.

<span id="an_120:1">120:1</span> In my distress, I cried to Yahweh. He
answered me.

<span id="an_120:2">120:2</span> Deliver my soul, Yahweh, from lying
lips, from a deceitful tongue.

<span id="an_120:3">120:3</span> What will be given to you, and what
will be done more to you, you deceitful tongue?

<span id="an_120:4">120:4</span> Sharp arrows of the mighty, with coals
of juniper.

<span id="an_120:5">120:5</span> Woe is me, that I live in Meshech, that
I dwell among the tents of Kedar!

<span id="an_120:6">120:6</span> My soul has had her dwelling too long
with him who hates peace.

<span id="an_120:7">120:7</span> I am for peace, but when I speak, they
are for war. A Song of Ascents.

<span id="an_121:1">121:1</span> I will lift up my eyes to the hills.
Where does my help come from?

<span id="an_121:2">121:2</span> My help comes from Yahweh, who made
heaven and earth.

<span id="an_121:3">121:3</span> He will not allow your foot to be
moved. He who keeps you will not slumber.

<span id="an_121:4">121:4</span> Behold, he who keeps Israel will
neither slumber nor sleep.

<span id="an_121:5">121:5</span> Yahweh is your keeper. Yahweh is your
shade on your right hand.

<span id="an_121:6">121:6</span> The sun will not harm you by day, nor
the moon by night.

<span id="an_121:7">121:7</span> Yahweh will keep you from all evil. He
will keep your soul.

<span id="an_121:8">121:8</span> Yahweh will keep your going out and
your coming in, from this time forth, and forevermore. A Song of
Ascents. By David.

<span id="an_122:1">122:1</span> I was glad when they said to me, "Let's
go to Yahweh's house!"

<span id="an_122:2">122:2</span> Our feet are standing within your
gates, Jerusalem;

<span id="an_122:3">122:3</span> Jerusalem, that is built as a city that
is compact together;

<span id="an_122:4">122:4</span> where the tribes go up, even Yah's
tribes, according to an ordinance for Israel, to give thanks to the name
of Yahweh.

<span id="an_122:5">122:5</span> For there are set thrones for judgment,
the thrones of David's house.

<span id="an_122:6">122:6</span> Pray for the peace of Jerusalem. Those
who love you will prosper.

<span id="an_122:7">122:7</span> Peace be within your walls, and
prosperity within your palaces.

<span id="an_122:8">122:8</span> For my brothers' and companions' sakes,
I will now say, "Peace be within you."

<span id="an_122:9">122:9</span> For the sake of the house of Yahweh our
God, I will seek your good. A Song of Ascents.

<span id="an_123:1">123:1</span> To you I do lift up my eyes, you who
sit in the heavens.

<span id="an_123:2">123:2</span> Behold, as the eyes of servants look to
the hand of their master, as the eyes of a maid to the hand of her
mistress; so our eyes look to Yahweh, our God, until he has mercy on us.

<span id="an_123:3">123:3</span> Have mercy on us, Yahweh, have mercy on
us, for we have endured much contempt.

<span id="an_123:4">123:4</span> Our soul is exceedingly filled with the
scoffing of those who are at ease, with the contempt of the proud. A
Song of Ascents. By David.

<span id="an_124:1">124:1</span> If it had not been Yahweh who was on
our side, let Israel now say,

<span id="an_124:2">124:2</span> if it had not been Yahweh who was on
our side, when men rose up against us;

<span id="an_124:3">124:3</span> then they would have swallowed us up
alive, when their wrath was kindled against us;

<span id="an_124:4">124:4</span> then the waters would have overwhelmed
us, the stream would have gone over our soul;

<span id="an_124:5">124:5</span> then the proud waters would have gone
over our soul.

<span id="an_124:6">124:6</span> Blessed be Yahweh, who has not given us
as a prey to their teeth.

<span id="an_124:7">124:7</span> Our soul has escaped like a bird out of
the fowler's snare. The snare is broken, and we have escaped.

<span id="an_124:8">124:8</span> Our help is in the name of Yahweh, who
made heaven and earth. A Song of Ascents.

<span id="an_125:1">125:1</span> Those who trust in Yahweh are as Mount
Zion, which can't be moved, but remains forever.

<span id="an_125:2">125:2</span> As the mountains surround Jerusalem, so
Yahweh surrounds his people from this time forth and forevermore.

<span id="an_125:3">125:3</span> For the scepter of wickedness won't
remain over the allotment of the righteous; so that the righteous won't
use their hands to do evil.

<span id="an_125:4">125:4</span> Do good, Yahweh, to those who are good,
to those who are upright in their hearts.

<span id="an_125:5">125:5</span> But as for those who turn aside to
their crooked ways, Yahweh will lead them away with the workers of
iniquity. Peace be on Israel. A Song of Ascents.

<span id="an_126:1">126:1</span> When Yahweh brought back those who
returned to Zion, we were like those who dream.

<span id="an_126:2">126:2</span> Then our mouth was filled with
laughter, and our tongue with singing. Then they said among the nations,
"Yahweh has done great things for them."

<span id="an_126:3">126:3</span> Yahweh has done great things for us,
and we are glad.

<span id="an_126:4">126:4</span> Restore our fortunes again, Yahweh,
like the streams in the Negev.

<span id="an_126:5">126:5</span> Those who sow in tears will reap in
joy.

<span id="an_126:6">126:6</span> He who goes out weeping, carrying seed
for sowing, will certainly come again with joy, carrying his sheaves. A
Song of Ascents. By Solomon.

<span id="an_127:1">127:1</span> Unless Yahweh builds the house, they
labor in vain who build it. Unless Yahweh watches over the city, the
watchman guards it in vain.

<span id="an_127:2">127:2</span> It is vain for you to rise up early, to
stay up late, eating the bread of toil; for he gives sleep to his loved
ones.

<span id="an_127:3">127:3</span> Behold, children are a heritage of
Yahweh. The fruit of the womb is his reward.

<span id="an_127:4">127:4</span> As arrows in the hand of a mighty man,
so are the children of youth.

<span id="an_127:5">127:5</span> Happy is the man who has his quiver
full of them. They won't be disappointed when they speak with their
enemies in the gate. A Song of Ascents.

<span id="an_128:1">128:1</span> Blessed is everyone who fears Yahweh,
who walks in his ways.

<span id="an_128:2">128:2</span> For you will eat the labor of your
hands. You will be happy, and it will be well with you.

<span id="an_128:3">128:3</span> Your wife will be as a fruitful vine,
in the innermost parts of your house; your children like olive plants,
around your table.

<span id="an_128:4">128:4</span> Behold, thus is the man blessed who
fears Yahweh.

<span id="an_128:5">128:5</span> May Yahweh bless you out of Zion, and
may you see the good of Jerusalem all the days of your life.

<span id="an_128:6">128:6</span> Yes, may you see your children's
children. Peace be upon Israel. A Song of Ascents.

<span id="an_129:1">129:1</span> Many times they have afflicted me from
my youth up. Let Israel now say,

<span id="an_129:2">129:2</span> many times they have afflicted me from
my youth up, yet they have not prevailed against me.

<span id="an_129:3">129:3</span> The plowers plowed on my back. They
made their furrows long.

<span id="an_129:4">129:4</span> Yahweh is righteous. He has cut apart
the cords of the wicked.

<span id="an_129:5">129:5</span> Let them be disappointed and turned
backward, all those who hate Zion.

<span id="an_129:6">129:6</span> Let them be as the grass on the
housetops, which withers before it grows up;

<span id="an_129:7">129:7</span> with which the reaper doesn't fill his
hand, nor he who binds sheaves, his bosom.

<span id="an_129:8">129:8</span> Neither do those who go by say, "The
blessing of Yahweh be on you. We bless you in the name of Yahweh." A
Song of Ascents.

<span id="an_130:1">130:1</span> Out of the depths I have cried to you,
Yahweh.

<span id="an_130:2">130:2</span> Lord, hear my voice. Let your ears be
attentive to the voice of my petitions.

<span id="an_130:3">130:3</span> If you, Yah, kept a record of sins,
Lord, who could stand?

<span id="an_130:4">130:4</span> But there is forgiveness with you,
therefore you are feared.

<span id="an_130:5">130:5</span> I wait for Yahweh. My soul waits. I
hope in his word.

<span id="an_130:6">130:6</span> My soul longs for the Lord more than
watchmen long for the morning; more than watchmen for the morning.

<span id="an_130:7">130:7</span> Israel, hope in Yahweh, for with Yahweh
there is loving kindness. With him is abundant redemption.

<span id="an_130:8">130:8</span> He will redeem Israel from all their
sins. A Song of Ascents. By David.

<span id="an_131:1">131:1</span> Yahweh, my heart isn't haughty, nor my
eyes lofty; nor do I concern myself with great matters, or things too
wonderful for me.

<span id="an_131:2">131:2</span> Surely I have stilled and quieted my
soul, like a weaned child with his mother, like a weaned child is my
soul within me.

<span id="an_131:3">131:3</span> Israel, hope in Yahweh, from this time
forth and forevermore. A Song of Ascents.

<span id="an_132:1">132:1</span> Yahweh, remember David and all his
affliction,

<span id="an_132:2">132:2</span> how he swore to Yahweh, and vowed to
the Mighty One of Jacob:

<span id="an_132:3">132:3</span> "Surely I will not come into the
structure of my house, nor go up into my bed;

<span id="an_132:4">132:4</span> I will not give sleep to my eyes, or
slumber to my eyelids;

<span id="an_132:5">132:5</span> until I find out a place for Yahweh, a
dwelling for the Mighty One of Jacob."

<span id="an_132:6">132:6</span> Behold, we heard of it in Ephrathah. We
found it in the field of Jaar:

<span id="an_132:7">132:7</span> "We will go into his dwelling place. We
will worship at his footstool.

<span id="an_132:8">132:8</span> Arise, Yahweh, into your resting place;
you, and the ark of your strength.

<span id="an_132:9">132:9</span> Let your priest be clothed with
righteousness. Let your saints shout for joy!"

<span id="an_132:10">132:10</span> For your servant David's sake, don't
turn away the face of your anointed one.

<span id="an_132:11">132:11</span> Yahweh has sworn to David in truth.
He will not turn from it: "I will set the fruit of your body on your
throne.

<span id="an_132:12">132:12</span> If your children will keep my
covenant, my testimony that I will teach them, their children also will
sit on your throne forevermore."

<span id="an_132:13">132:13</span> For Yahweh has chosen Zion. He has
desired it for his habitation.

<span id="an_132:14">132:14</span> "This is my resting place forever.
Here I will live, for I have desired it.

<span id="an_132:15">132:15</span> I will abundantly bless her
provision. I will satisfy her poor with bread.

<span id="an_132:16">132:16</span> Her priests I will also clothe with
salvation. Her saints will shout aloud for joy.

<span id="an_132:17">132:17</span> There I will make the horn of David
to bud. I have ordained a lamp for my anointed.

<span id="an_132:18">132:18</span> I will clothe his enemies with shame,
but on himself, his crown will be resplendent." A Song of Ascents. By
David.

<span id="an_133:1">133:1</span> See how good and how pleasant it is for
brothers to live together in unity!

<span id="an_133:2">133:2</span> It is like the precious oil on the
head, that ran down on the beard, even Aaron's beard; that came down on
the edge of his robes;

<span id="an_133:3">133:3</span> like the dew of Hermon, that comes down
on the hills of Zion: for there Yahweh gives the blessing, even life
forevermore. A Song of Ascents.

<span id="an_134:1">134:1</span> Look! Praise Yahweh, all you servants
of Yahweh, who stand by night in Yahweh's house!

<span id="an_134:2">134:2</span> Lift up your hands in the sanctuary.
Praise Yahweh!

<span id="an_134:3">134:3</span> May Yahweh bless you from Zion; even he
who made heaven and earth.

<span id="an_135:1">135:1</span> Praise Yah! Praise the name of Yahweh!
Praise him, you servants of Yahweh,

<span id="an_135:2">135:2</span> you who stand in the house of Yahweh,
in the courts of our God's house.

<span id="an_135:3">135:3</span> Praise Yah, for Yahweh is good. Sing
praises to his name, for that is pleasant.

<span id="an_135:4">135:4</span> For Yah has chosen Jacob for himself;
Israel for his own possession.

<span id="an_135:5">135:5</span> For I know that Yahweh is great, that
our Lord is above all gods.

<span id="an_135:6">135:6</span> Whatever Yahweh pleased, that he has
done, in heaven and in earth, in the seas and in all deeps;

<span id="an_135:7">135:7</span> who causes the clouds to rise from the
ends of the earth; who makes lightnings with the rain; who brings forth
the wind out of his treasuries;

<span id="an_135:8">135:8</span> Who struck the firstborn of Egypt, both
of man and animal;

<span id="an_135:9">135:9</span> Who sent signs and wonders into the
midst of you, Egypt, on Pharaoh, and on all his servants;

<span id="an_135:10">135:10</span> who struck many nations, and killed
mighty kings,

<span id="an_135:11">135:11</span> Sihon king of the Amorites, Og king
of Bashan, and all the kingdoms of Canaan,

<span id="an_135:12">135:12</span> and gave their land for a heritage, a
heritage to Israel, his people.

<span id="an_135:13">135:13</span> Your name, Yahweh, endures forever;
your renown, Yahweh, throughout all generations.

<span id="an_135:14">135:14</span> For Yahweh will judge his people, and
have compassion on his servants.

<span id="an_135:15">135:15</span> The idols of the nations are silver
and gold, the work of men's hands.

<span id="an_135:16">135:16</span> They have mouths, but they can't
speak. They have eyes, but they can't see.

<span id="an_135:17">135:17</span> They have ears, but they can't hear;
neither is there any breath in their mouths.

<span id="an_135:18">135:18</span> Those who make them will be like
them; yes, everyone who trusts in them.

<span id="an_135:19">135:19</span> House of Israel, praise Yahweh! House
of Aaron, praise Yahweh!

<span id="an_135:20">135:20</span> House of Levi, praise Yahweh! You who
fear Yahweh, praise Yahweh!

<span id="an_135:21">135:21</span> Blessed be Yahweh from Zion, Who
dwells at Jerusalem. Praise Yah!

<span id="an_136:1">136:1</span> Give thanks to Yahweh, for he is good;
for his loving kindness endures forever.

<span id="an_136:2">136:2</span> Give thanks to the God of gods; for his
loving kindness endures forever.

<span id="an_136:3">136:3</span> Give thanks to the Lord of lords; for
his loving kindness endures forever:

<span id="an_136:4">136:4</span> To him who alone does great wonders;
for his loving kindness endures forever:

<span id="an_136:5">136:5</span> To him who by understanding made the
heavens; for his loving kindness endures forever:

<span id="an_136:6">136:6</span> To him who spread out the earth above
the waters; for his loving kindness endures forever:

<span id="an_136:7">136:7</span> To him who made the great lights; for
his loving kindness endures forever:

<span id="an_136:8">136:8</span> The sun to rule by day; for his loving
kindness endures forever;

<span id="an_136:9">136:9</span> The moon and stars to rule by night;
for his loving kindness endures forever:

<span id="an_136:10">136:10</span> To him who struck down the Egyptian
firstborn; for his loving kindness endures forever;

<span id="an_136:11">136:11</span> And brought out Israel from among
them; for his loving kindness endures forever;

<span id="an_136:12">136:12</span> With a strong hand, and with an
outstretched arm; for his loving kindness endures forever:

<span id="an_136:13">136:13</span> To him who divided the Red Sea apart;
for his loving kindness endures forever;

<span id="an_136:14">136:14</span> And made Israel to pass through its
midst; for his loving kindness endures forever;

<span id="an_136:15">136:15</span> But overthrew Pharaoh and his army in
the Red Sea; for his loving kindness endures forever:

<span id="an_136:16">136:16</span> To him who led his people through the
wilderness; for his loving kindness endures forever:

<span id="an_136:17">136:17</span> To him who struck great kings; for
his loving kindness endures forever;

<span id="an_136:18">136:18</span> And killed mighty kings; for his
loving kindness endures forever:

<span id="an_136:19">136:19</span> Sihon king of the Amorites; for his
loving kindness endures forever;

<span id="an_136:20">136:20</span> Og king of Bashan; for his loving
kindness endures forever;

<span id="an_136:21">136:21</span> And gave their land as an
inheritance; for his loving kindness endures forever;

<span id="an_136:22">136:22</span> Even a heritage to Israel his
servant; for his loving kindness endures forever:

<span id="an_136:23">136:23</span> Who remembered us in our low estate;
for his loving kindness endures forever;

<span id="an_136:24">136:24</span> And has delivered us from our
adversaries; for his loving kindness endures forever:

<span id="an_136:25">136:25</span> Who gives food to every creature; for
his loving kindness endures forever.

<span id="an_136:26">136:26</span> Oh give thanks to the God of heaven;
for his loving kindness endures forever.

<span id="an_137:1">137:1</span> By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat
down. Yes, we wept, when we remembered Zion.

<span id="an_137:2">137:2</span> On the willows in its midst, we hung up
our harps.

<span id="an_137:3">137:3</span> For there, those who led us captive
asked us for songs. Those who tormented us demanded songs of joy: "Sing
us one of the songs of Zion!"

<span id="an_137:4">137:4</span> How can we sing Yahweh's song in a
foreign land?

<span id="an_137:5">137:5</span> If I forget you, Jerusalem, let my
right hand forget its skill.

<span id="an_137:6">137:6</span> Let my tongue stick to the roof of my
mouth if I don't remember you; if I don't prefer Jerusalem above my
chief joy.

<span id="an_137:7">137:7</span> Remember, Yahweh, against the children
of Edom, the day of Jerusalem; who said, "Raze it! Raze it even to its
foundation!"

<span id="an_137:8">137:8</span> Daughter of Babylon, doomed to
destruction, he will be happy who rewards you, as you have served us.

<span id="an_137:9">137:9</span> Happy shall he be, who takes and dashes
your little ones against the rock. By David.

<span id="an_138:1">138:1</span> I will give you thanks with my whole
heart. Before the gods, I will sing praises to you.

<span id="an_138:2">138:2</span> I will bow down toward your holy
temple, and give thanks to your Name for your loving kindness and for
your truth; for you have exalted your Name and your Word above all.

<span id="an_138:3">138:3</span> In the day that I called, you answered
me. You encouraged me with strength in my soul.

<span id="an_138:4">138:4</span> All the kings of the earth will give
you thanks, Yahweh, for they have heard the words of your mouth.

<span id="an_138:5">138:5</span> Yes, they will sing of the ways of
Yahweh; for great is Yahweh's glory.

<span id="an_138:6">138:6</span> For though Yahweh is high, yet he looks
after the lowly; but the proud, he knows from afar.

<span id="an_138:7">138:7</span> Though I walk in the midst of trouble,
you will revive me. You will stretch forth your hand against the wrath
of my enemies. Your right hand will save me.

<span id="an_138:8">138:8</span> Yahweh will fulfill that which concerns
me; your loving kindness, Yahweh, endures forever. Don't forsake the
works of your own hands. For the Chief Musician. A Psalm by David.

<span id="an_139:1">139:1</span> Yahweh, you have searched me, and you
know me.

<span id="an_139:2">139:2</span> You know my sitting down and my rising
up. You perceive my thoughts from afar.

<span id="an_139:3">139:3</span> You search out my path and my lying
down, and are acquainted with all my ways.

<span id="an_139:4">139:4</span> For there is not a word on my tongue,
but, behold, Yahweh, you know it altogether.

<span id="an_139:5">139:5</span> You hem me in behind and before. You
laid your hand on me.

<span id="an_139:6">139:6</span> This knowledge is beyond me. It's
lofty. I can't attain it.

<span id="an_139:7">139:7</span> Where could I go from your Spirit? Or
where could I flee from your presence?

<span id="an_139:8">139:8</span> If I ascend up into heaven, you are
there. If I make my bed in Sheol, behold, you are there!

<span id="an_139:9">139:9</span> If I take the wings of the dawn, and
settle in the uttermost parts of the sea;

<span id="an_139:10">139:10</span> Even there your hand will lead me,
and your right hand will hold me.

<span id="an_139:11">139:11</span> If I say, "Surely the darkness will
overwhelm me; the light around me will be night;"

<span id="an_139:12">139:12</span> even the darkness doesn't hide from
you, but the night shines as the day. The darkness is like light to you.

<span id="an_139:13">139:13</span> For you formed my inmost being. You
knit me together in my mother's womb.

<span id="an_139:14">139:14</span> I will give thanks to you, for I am
fearfully and wonderfully made. Your works are wonderful. My soul knows
that very well.

<span id="an_139:15">139:15</span> My frame wasn't hidden from you, when
I was made in secret, woven together in the depths of the earth.

<span id="an_139:16">139:16</span> Your eyes saw my body. In your book
they were all written, the days that were ordained for me, when as yet
there were none of them.

<span id="an_139:17">139:17</span> How precious to me are your thoughts,
God! How vast is the sum of them!

<span id="an_139:18">139:18</span> If I would count them, they are more
in number than the sand. When I wake up, I am still with you.

<span id="an_139:19">139:19</span> If only you, God, would kill the
wicked. Get away from me, you bloodthirsty men!

<span id="an_139:20">139:20</span> For they speak against you wickedly.
Your enemies take your name in vain.

<span id="an_139:21">139:21</span> Yahweh, don't I hate those who hate
you? Am I not grieved with those who rise up against you?

<span id="an_139:22">139:22</span> I hate them with perfect hatred. They
have become my enemies.

<span id="an_139:23">139:23</span> Search me, God, and know my heart.
Try me, and know my thoughts.

<span id="an_139:24">139:24</span> See if there is any wicked way in me,
and lead me in the everlasting way. For the Chief Musician. A Psalm by
David.

<span id="an_140:1">140:1</span> Deliver me, Yahweh, from the evil man.
Preserve me from the violent man;

<span id="an_140:2">140:2</span> those who devise mischief in their
hearts. They continually gather themselves together for war.

<span id="an_140:3">140:3</span> They have sharpened their tongues like
a serpent. Viper's poison is under their lips. Selah.

<span id="an_140:4">140:4</span> Yahweh, keep me from the hands of the
wicked. Preserve me from the violent men who have determined to trip my
feet.

<span id="an_140:5">140:5</span> The proud have hidden a snare for me,
they have spread the cords of a net by the path. They have set traps for
me. Selah.

<span id="an_140:6">140:6</span> I said to Yahweh, "You are my God."
Listen to the cry of my petitions, Yahweh.

<span id="an_140:7">140:7</span> Yahweh, the Lord, the strength of my
salvation, you have covered my head in the day of battle.

<span id="an_140:8">140:8</span> Yahweh, don't grant the desires of the
wicked. Don't let their evil plans succeed, or they will become proud.
Selah.

<span id="an_140:9">140:9</span> As for the head of those who surround
me, let the mischief of their own lips cover them.

<span id="an_140:10">140:10</span> Let burning coals fall on them. Let
them be thrown into the fire, into miry pits, from where they never
rise.

<span id="an_140:11">140:11</span> An evil speaker won't be established
in the earth. Evil will hunt the violent man to overthrow him.

<span id="an_140:12">140:12</span> I know that Yahweh will maintain the
cause of the afflicted, and justice for the needy.

<span id="an_140:13">140:13</span> Surely the righteous will give thanks
to your name. The upright will dwell in your presence. A Psalm by David.

<span id="an_141:1">141:1</span> Yahweh, I have called on you. Come to
me quickly! Listen to my voice when I call to you.

<span id="an_141:2">141:2</span> Let my prayer be set before you like
incense; the lifting up of my hands like the evening sacrifice.

<span id="an_141:3">141:3</span> Set a watch, Yahweh, before my mouth.
Keep the door of my lips.

<span id="an_141:4">141:4</span> Don't incline my heart to any evil
thing, to practice deeds of wickedness with men who work iniquity. Don't
let me eat of their delicacies.

<span id="an_141:5">141:5</span> Let the righteous strike me, it is
kindness; let him reprove me, it is like oil on the head; don't let my
head refuse it; Yet my prayer is always against evil deeds.

<span id="an_141:6">141:6</span> Their judges are thrown down by the
sides of the rock. They will hear my words, for they are well spoken.

<span id="an_141:7">141:7</span> "As when one plows and breaks up the
earth, our bones are scattered at the mouth of Sheol."

<span id="an_141:8">141:8</span> For my eyes are on you, Yahweh, the
Lord. In you, I take refuge. Don't leave my soul destitute.

<span id="an_141:9">141:9</span> Keep me from the snare which they have
laid for me, from the traps of the workers of iniquity.

<span id="an_141:10">141:10</span> Let the wicked fall together into
their own nets, while I pass by. A contemplation by David, when he was
in the cave. A Prayer.

<span id="an_142:1">142:1</span> I cry with my voice to Yahweh. With my
voice, I ask Yahweh for mercy.

<span id="an_142:2">142:2</span> I pour out my complaint before him. I
tell him my troubles.

<span id="an_142:3">142:3</span> When my spirit was overwhelmed within
me, you knew my path. In the way in which I walk, they have hidden a
snare for me.

<span id="an_142:4">142:4</span> Look on my right, and see; for there is
no one who is concerned for me. Refuge has fled from me. No one cares
for my soul.

<span id="an_142:5">142:5</span> I cried to you, Yahweh. I said, "You
are my refuge, my portion in the land of the living."

<span id="an_142:6">142:6</span> Listen to my cry, for I am in desperate
need. deliver me from my persecutors, For they are stronger than me.

<span id="an_142:7">142:7</span> Bring my soul out of prison, that I may
give thanks to your name. The righteous will surround me, for you will
be good to me. A Psalm by David.

<span id="an_143:1">143:1</span> Hear my prayer, Yahweh. Listen to my
petitions. In your faithfulness and righteousness, relieve me.

<span id="an_143:2">143:2</span> Don't enter into judgment with your
servant, for in your sight no man living is righteous.

<span id="an_143:3">143:3</span> For the enemy pursues my soul. He has
struck my life down to the ground. He has made me live in dark places,
as those who have been long dead.

<span id="an_143:4">143:4</span> Therefore my spirit is overwhelmed
within me. My heart within me is desolate.

<span id="an_143:5">143:5</span> I remember the days of old. I meditate
on all your doings. I contemplate the work of your hands.

<span id="an_143:6">143:6</span> I spread forth my hands to you. My soul
thirsts for you, like a parched land. Selah.

<span id="an_143:7">143:7</span> Hurry to answer me, Yahweh. My spirit
fails. Don't hide your face from me, so that I don't become like those
who go down into the pit.

<span id="an_143:8">143:8</span> Cause me to hear your loving kindness
in the morning, for I trust in you. Cause me to know the way in which I
should walk, for I lift up my soul to you.

<span id="an_143:9">143:9</span> Deliver me, Yahweh, from my enemies. I
flee to you to hide me.

<span id="an_143:10">143:10</span> Teach me to do your will, for you are
my God. Your Spirit is good. Lead me in the land of uprightness.

<span id="an_143:11">143:11</span> Revive me, Yahweh, for your name's
sake. In your righteousness, bring my soul out of trouble.

<span id="an_143:12">143:12</span> In your loving kindness, cut off my
enemies, and destroy all those who afflict my soul, For I am your
servant. By David.

<span id="an_144:1">144:1</span> Blessed be Yahweh, my rock, who teaches
my hands to war, and my fingers to battle:

<span id="an_144:2">144:2</span> my loving kindness, my fortress, my
high tower, my deliverer, my shield, and he in whom I take refuge; who
subdues my people under me.

<span id="an_144:3">144:3</span> Yahweh, what is man, that you care for
him? Or the son of man, that you think of him?

<span id="an_144:4">144:4</span> Man is like a breath. His days are like
a shadow that passes away.

<span id="an_144:5">144:5</span> Part your heavens, Yahweh, and come
down. Touch the mountains, and they will smoke.

<span id="an_144:6">144:6</span> Throw out lightning, and scatter them.
Send out your arrows, and rout them.

<span id="an_144:7">144:7</span> Stretch out your hand from above,
rescue me, and deliver me out of great waters, out of the hands of
foreigners;

<span id="an_144:8">144:8</span> whose mouths speak deceit, Whose right
hand is a right hand of falsehood.

<span id="an_144:9">144:9</span> I will sing a new song to you, God. On
a ten-stringed lyre, I will sing praises to you.

<span id="an_144:10">144:10</span> You are he who gives salvation to
kings, who rescues David, his servant, from the deadly sword.

<span id="an_144:11">144:11</span> Rescue me, and deliver me out of the
hands of foreigners, whose mouths speak deceit, whose right hand is a
right hand of falsehood.

<span id="an_144:12">144:12</span> Then our sons will be like
well-nurtured plants, our daughters like pillars carved to adorn a
palace.

<span id="an_144:13">144:13</span> Our barns are full, filled with all
kinds of provision. Our sheep bring forth thousands and ten thousands in
our fields.

<span id="an_144:14">144:14</span> Our oxen will pull heavy loads. There
is no breaking in, and no going away, and no outcry in our streets.

<span id="an_144:15">144:15</span> Happy are the people who are in such
a situation. Happy are the people whose God is Yahweh. A praise psalm by
David.

<span id="an_145:1">145:1</span> I will exalt you, my God, the King. I
will praise your name forever and ever.

<span id="an_145:2">145:2</span> Every day I will praise you. I will
extol your name forever and ever.

<span id="an_145:3">145:3</span> Great is Yahweh, and greatly to be
praised! His greatness is unsearchable.

<span id="an_145:4">145:4</span> One generation will commend your works
to another, and will declare your mighty acts.

<span id="an_145:5">145:5</span> Of the glorious majesty of your honor,
of your wondrous works, I will meditate.

<span id="an_145:6">145:6</span> Men will speak of the might of your
awesome acts. I will declare your greatness.

<span id="an_145:7">145:7</span> They will utter the memory of your
great goodness, and will sing of your righteousness.

<span id="an_145:8">145:8</span> Yahweh is gracious, merciful, slow to
anger, and of great loving kindness.

<span id="an_145:9">145:9</span> Yahweh is good to all. His tender
mercies are over all his works.

<span id="an_145:10">145:10</span> All your works will give thanks to
you, Yahweh. Your saints will extol you.

<span id="an_145:11">145:11</span> They will speak of the glory of your
kingdom, and talk about your power;

<span id="an_145:12">145:12</span> to make known to the sons of men his
mighty acts, the glory of the majesty of his kingdom.

<span id="an_145:13">145:13</span> Your kingdom is an everlasting
kingdom. Your dominion endures throughout all generations. Yahweh is
faithful in all his words, and loving in all his deeds.

<span id="an_145:14">145:14</span> Yahweh upholds all who fall, and
raises up all those who are bowed down.

<span id="an_145:15">145:15</span> The eyes of all wait for you. You
give them their food in due season.

<span id="an_145:16">145:16</span> You open your hand, and satisfy the
desire of every living thing.

<span id="an_145:17">145:17</span> Yahweh is righteous in all his ways,
and gracious in all his works.

<span id="an_145:18">145:18</span> Yahweh is near to all those who call
on him, to all who call on him in truth.

<span id="an_145:19">145:19</span> He will fulfill the desire of those
who fear him. He also will hear their cry, and will save them.

<span id="an_145:20">145:20</span> Yahweh preserves all those who love
him, but all the wicked he will destroy.

<span id="an_145:21">145:21</span> My mouth will speak the praise of
Yahweh. Let all flesh bless his holy name forever and ever.

<span id="an_146:1">146:1</span> Praise Yah! Praise Yahweh, my soul.

<span id="an_146:2">146:2</span> While I live, I will praise Yahweh. I
will sing praises to my God as long as I exist.

<span id="an_146:3">146:3</span> Don't put your trust in princes, each a
son of man in whom there is no help.

<span id="an_146:4">146:4</span> His spirit departs, and he returns to
the earth. In that very day, his thoughts perish.

<span id="an_146:5">146:5</span> Happy is he who has the God of Jacob
for his help, whose hope is in Yahweh, his God:

<span id="an_146:6">146:6</span> who made heaven and earth, the sea, and
all that is in them; who keeps truth forever;

<span id="an_146:7">146:7</span> who executes justice for the oppressed;
who gives food to the hungry. Yahweh frees the prisoners.

<span id="an_146:8">146:8</span> Yahweh opens the eyes of the blind.
Yahweh raises up those who are bowed down. Yahweh loves the righteous.

<span id="an_146:9">146:9</span> Yahweh preserves the foreigners. He
upholds the fatherless and widow, but the way of the wicked he turns
upside down.

<span id="an_146:10">146:10</span> Yahweh will reign forever; your God,
O Zion, to all generations. Praise Yah!

<span id="an_147:1">147:1</span> Praise Yah, for it is good to sing
praises to our God; for it is pleasant and fitting to praise him.

<span id="an_147:2">147:2</span> Yahweh builds up Jerusalem. He gathers
together the outcasts of Israel.

<span id="an_147:3">147:3</span> He heals the broken in heart, and binds
up their wounds.

<span id="an_147:4">147:4</span> He counts the number of the stars. He
calls them all by their names.

<span id="an_147:5">147:5</span> Great is our Lord, and mighty in power.
His understanding is infinite.

<span id="an_147:6">147:6</span> Yahweh upholds the humble. He brings
the wicked down to the ground.

<span id="an_147:7">147:7</span> Sing to Yahweh with thanksgiving. Sing
praises on the harp to our God,

<span id="an_147:8">147:8</span> who covers the sky with clouds, who
prepares rain for the earth, who makes grass grow on the mountains.

<span id="an_147:9">147:9</span> He provides food for the livestock, and
for the young ravens when they call.

<span id="an_147:10">147:10</span> He doesn't delight in the strength of
the horse. He takes no pleasure in the legs of a man.

<span id="an_147:11">147:11</span> Yahweh takes pleasure in those who
fear him, in those who hope in his loving kindness.

<span id="an_147:12">147:12</span> Praise Yahweh, Jerusalem! Praise your
God, Zion!

<span id="an_147:13">147:13</span> For he has strengthened the bars of
your gates. He has blessed your children within you.

<span id="an_147:14">147:14</span> He makes peace in your borders. He
fills you with the finest of the wheat.

<span id="an_147:15">147:15</span> He sends out his commandment to the
earth. His word runs very swiftly.

<span id="an_147:16">147:16</span> He gives snow like wool, and scatters
frost like ashes.

<span id="an_147:17">147:17</span> He hurls down his hail like pebbles.
Who can stand before his cold?

<span id="an_147:18">147:18</span> He sends out his word, and melts
them. He causes his wind to blow, and the waters flow.

<span id="an_147:19">147:19</span> He shows his word to Jacob; his
statutes and his ordinances to Israel.

<span id="an_147:20">147:20</span> He has not done this for just any
nation. They don't know his ordinances. Praise Yah!

<span id="an_148:1">148:1</span> Praise Yah! Praise Yahweh from the
heavens! Praise him in the heights!

<span id="an_148:2">148:2</span> Praise him, all his angels! Praise him,
all his army!

<span id="an_148:3">148:3</span> Praise him, sun and moon! Praise him,
all you shining stars!

<span id="an_148:4">148:4</span> Praise him, you heavens of heavens, You
waters that are above the heavens.

<span id="an_148:5">148:5</span> Let them praise the name of Yahweh, For
he commanded, and they were created.

<span id="an_148:6">148:6</span> He has also established them forever
and ever. He has made a decree which will not pass away.

<span id="an_148:7">148:7</span> Praise Yahweh from the earth, you great
sea creatures, and all depths!

<span id="an_148:8">148:8</span> Lightning and hail, snow and clouds;
stormy wind, fulfilling his word;

<span id="an_148:9">148:9</span> mountains and all hills; fruit trees
and all cedars;

<span id="an_148:10">148:10</span> wild animals and all livestock; small
creatures and flying birds;

<span id="an_148:11">148:11</span> kings of the earth and all peoples;
princes and all judges of the earth;

<span id="an_148:12">148:12</span> both young men and maidens; old men
and children:

<span id="an_148:13">148:13</span> let them praise the name of Yahweh,
for his name alone is exalted. His glory is above the earth and the
heavens.

<span id="an_148:14">148:14</span> He has lifted up the horn of his
people, the praise of all his saints; even of the children of Israel, a
people near to him. Praise Yah!

<span id="an_149:1">149:1</span> Praise Yahweh! Sing to Yahweh a new
song, his praise in the assembly of the saints.

<span id="an_149:2">149:2</span> Let Israel rejoice in him who made
them. Let the children of Zion be joyful in their King.

<span id="an_149:3">149:3</span> Let them praise his name in the dance!
Let them sing praises to him with tambourine and harp!

<span id="an_149:4">149:4</span> For Yahweh takes pleasure in his
people. He crowns the humble with salvation.

<span id="an_149:5">149:5</span> Let the saints rejoice in honor. Let
them sing for joy on their beds.

<span id="an_149:6">149:6</span> May the high praises of God be in their
mouths, and a two-edged sword in their hand;

<span id="an_149:7">149:7</span> To execute vengeance on the nations,
and punishments on the peoples;

<span id="an_149:8">149:8</span> To bind their kings with chains, and
their nobles with fetters of iron;

<span id="an_149:9">149:9</span> to execute on them the written
judgment. All his saints have this honor. Praise Yah!

<span id="an_150:1">150:1</span> Praise Yah! Praise God in his
sanctuary! Praise him in his heavens for his acts of power!

<span id="an_150:2">150:2</span> Praise him for his mighty acts! Praise
him according to his excellent greatness!

<span id="an_150:3">150:3</span> Praise him with the sounding of the
trumpet! Praise him with harp and lyre!

<span id="an_150:4">150:4</span> Praise him with tambourine and dancing!
Praise him with stringed instruments and flute!

<span id="an_150:5">150:5</span> Praise him with loud cymbals! Praise
him with resounding cymbals!

<span id="an_150:6">150:6</span> Let everything that has breath praise
Yah! Praise Yah!
