### World English Bible: Luke

<span id="an_1:1">1:1</span> Since many have undertaken to set in order
a narrative concerning those matters which have been fulfilled among us,

<span id="an_1:2">1:2</span> even as those who from the beginning were
eyewitnesses and servants of the word delivered them to us,

<span id="an_1:3">1:3</span> it seemed good to me also, having traced
the course of all things accurately from the first, to write to you in
order, most excellent Theophilus;

<span id="an_1:4">1:4</span> that you might know the certainty
concerning the things in which you were instructed.

<span id="an_1:5">1:5</span> There was in the days of Herod, the king of
Judea, a certain priest named Zacharias, of the priestly division of
Abijah. He had a wife of the daughters of Aaron, and her name was
Elizabeth.

<span id="an_1:6">1:6</span> They were both righteous before God,
walking blamelessly in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord.

<span id="an_1:7">1:7</span> But they had no child, because Elizabeth
was barren, and they both were well advanced in years.

<span id="an_1:8">1:8</span> Now it happened, while he executed the
priest's office before God in the order of his division,

<span id="an_1:9">1:9</span> according to the custom of the priest's
office, his lot was to enter into the temple of the Lord and burn
incense.

<span id="an_1:10">1:10</span> The whole multitude of the people were
praying outside at the hour of incense.

<span id="an_1:11">1:11</span> An angel of the Lord appeared to him,
standing on the right side of the altar of incense.

<span id="an_1:12">1:12</span> Zacharias was troubled when he saw him,
and fear fell upon him.

<span id="an_1:13">1:13</span> But the angel said to him, "Don't be
afraid, Zacharias, because your request has been heard, and your wife,
Elizabeth, will bear you a son, and you shall call his name John.

<span id="an_1:14">1:14</span> You will have joy and gladness; and many
will rejoice at his birth.

<span id="an_1:15">1:15</span> For he will be great in the sight of the
Lord, and he will drink no wine nor strong drink. He will be filled with
the Holy Spirit, even from his mother's womb.

<span id="an_1:16">1:16</span> He will turn many of the children of
Israel to the Lord, their God.

<span id="an_1:17">1:17</span> He will go before him in the spirit and
power of Elijah, 'to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children,'
and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just; to prepare a people
prepared for the Lord."

<span id="an_1:18">1:18</span> Zacharias said to the angel, "How can I
be sure of this? For I am an old man, and my wife is well advanced in
years."

<span id="an_1:19">1:19</span> The angel answered him, "I am Gabriel,
who stands in the presence of God. I was sent to speak to you, and to
bring you this good news.

<span id="an_1:20">1:20</span> Behold, you will be silent and not able
to speak, until the day that these things will happen, because you
didn't believe my words, which will be fulfilled in their proper time."

<span id="an_1:21">1:21</span> The people were waiting for Zacharias,
and they marveled that he delayed in the temple.

<span id="an_1:22">1:22</span> When he came out, he could not speak to
them, and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple. He
continued making signs to them, and remained mute.

<span id="an_1:23">1:23</span> It happened, when the days of his service
were fulfilled, he departed to his house.

<span id="an_1:24">1:24</span> After these days Elizabeth, his wife,
conceived, and she hid herself five months, saying,

<span id="an_1:25">1:25</span> "Thus has the Lord done to me in the days
in which he looked at me, to take away my reproach among men."

<span id="an_1:26">1:26</span> Now in the sixth month, the angel Gabriel
was sent from God to a city of Galilee, named Nazareth,

<span id="an_1:27">1:27</span> to a virgin pledged to be married to a
man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David. The virgin's name was
Mary.

<span id="an_1:28">1:28</span> Having come in, the angel said to her,
"Rejoice, you highly favored one! The Lord is with you. Blessed are you
among women!"

<span id="an_1:29">1:29</span> But when she saw him, she was greatly
troubled at the saying, and considered what kind of salutation this
might be.

<span id="an_1:30">1:30</span> The angel said to her, "Don't be afraid,
Mary, for you have found favor with God.

<span id="an_1:31">1:31</span> Behold, you will conceive in your womb,
and bring forth a son, and will call his name 'Jesus.'

<span id="an_1:32">1:32</span> He will be great, and will be called the
Son of the Most High. The Lord God will give him the throne of his
father, David,

<span id="an_1:33">1:33</span> and he will reign over the house of Jacob
forever. There will be no end to his Kingdom."

<span id="an_1:34">1:34</span> Mary said to the angel, "How can this be,
seeing I am a virgin?"

<span id="an_1:35">1:35</span> The angel answered her, "The Holy Spirit
will come on you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you.
Therefore also the holy one who is born from you will be called the Son
of God.

<span id="an_1:36">1:36</span> Behold, Elizabeth, your relative, also
has conceived a son in her old age; and this is the sixth month with her
who was called barren.

<span id="an_1:37">1:37</span> For everything spoken by God is
possible."

<span id="an_1:38">1:38</span> Mary said, "Behold, the handmaid of the
Lord; be it to me according to your word." The angel departed from her.

<span id="an_1:39">1:39</span> Mary arose in those days and went into
the hill country with haste, into a city of Judah,

<span id="an_1:40">1:40</span> and entered into the house of Zacharias
and greeted Elizabeth.

<span id="an_1:41">1:41</span> It happened, when Elizabeth heard Mary's
greeting, that the baby leaped in her womb, and Elizabeth was filled
with the Holy Spirit.

<span id="an_1:42">1:42</span> She called out with a loud voice, and
said, "Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your
womb!

<span id="an_1:43">1:43</span> Why am I so favored, that the mother of
my Lord should come to me?

<span id="an_1:44">1:44</span> For behold, when the voice of your
greeting came into my ears, the baby leaped in my womb for joy!

<span id="an_1:45">1:45</span> Blessed is she who believed, for there
will be a fulfillment of the things which have been spoken to her from
the Lord!"

<span id="an_1:46">1:46</span> Mary said, "My soul magnifies the Lord.

<span id="an_1:47">1:47</span> My spirit has rejoiced in God my Savior,

<span id="an_1:48">1:48</span> for he has looked at the humble state of
his handmaid. For behold, from now on, all generations will call me
blessed.

<span id="an_1:49">1:49</span> For he who is mighty has done great
things for me. Holy is his name.

<span id="an_1:50">1:50</span> His mercy is for generations of
generations on those who fear him.

<span id="an_1:51">1:51</span> He has shown strength with his arm. He
has scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts.

<span id="an_1:52">1:52</span> He has put down princes from their
thrones. And has exalted the lowly.

<span id="an_1:53">1:53</span> He has filled the hungry with good
things. He has sent the rich away empty.

<span id="an_1:54">1:54</span> He has given help to Israel, his servant,
that he might remember mercy,

<span id="an_1:55">1:55</span> As he spoke to our fathers, to Abraham
and his seed forever."

<span id="an_1:56">1:56</span> Mary stayed with her about three months,
and then returned to her house.

<span id="an_1:57">1:57</span> Now the time that Elizabeth should give
birth was fulfilled, and she brought forth a son.

<span id="an_1:58">1:58</span> Her neighbors and her relatives heard
that the Lord had magnified his mercy towards her, and they rejoiced
with her.

<span id="an_1:59">1:59</span> It happened on the eighth day, that they
came to circumcise the child; and they would have called him Zacharias,
after the name of the father.

<span id="an_1:60">1:60</span> His mother answered, "Not so; but he will
be called John."

<span id="an_1:61">1:61</span> They said to her, "There is no one among
your relatives who is called by this name."

<span id="an_1:62">1:62</span> They made signs to his father, what he
would have him called.

<span id="an_1:63">1:63</span> He asked for a writing tablet, and wrote,
"His name is John." They all marveled.

<span id="an_1:64">1:64</span> His mouth was opened immediately, and his
tongue freed, and he spoke, blessing God.

<span id="an_1:65">1:65</span> Fear came on all who lived around them,
and all these sayings were talked about throughout all the hill country
of Judea.

<span id="an_1:66">1:66</span> All who heard them laid them up in their
heart, saying, "What then will this child be?" The hand of the Lord was
with him.

<span id="an_1:67">1:67</span> His father, Zacharias, was filled with
the Holy Spirit, and prophesied, saying,

<span id="an_1:68">1:68</span> "Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel,
for he has visited and worked redemption for his people;

<span id="an_1:69">1:69</span> and has raised up a horn of salvation for
us in the house of his servant David

<span id="an_1:70">1:70</span> (as he spoke by the mouth of his holy
prophets who have been from of old),

<span id="an_1:71">1:71</span> salvation from our enemies, and from the
hand of all who hate us;

<span id="an_1:72">1:72</span> to show mercy towards our fathers, to
remember his holy covenant,

<span id="an_1:73">1:73</span> the oath which he spoke to Abraham, our
father,

<span id="an_1:74">1:74</span> to grant to us that we, being delivered
out of the hand of our enemies, should serve him without fear,

<span id="an_1:75">1:75</span> In holiness and righteousness before him
all the days of our life.

<span id="an_1:76">1:76</span> And you, child, will be called a prophet
of the Most High, for you will go before the face of the Lord to prepare
his ways,

<span id="an_1:77">1:77</span> to give knowledge of salvation to his
people by the remission of their sins,

<span id="an_1:78">1:78</span> because of the tender mercy of our God,
whereby the dawn from on high will visit us,

<span id="an_1:79">1:79</span> to shine on those who sit in darkness and
the shadow of death; to guide our feet into the way of peace."

<span id="an_1:80">1:80</span> The child was growing, and becoming
strong in spirit, and was in the desert until the day of his public
appearance to Israel.

<span id="an_2:1">2:1</span> Now it happened in those days, that a
decree went out from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be
enrolled.

<span id="an_2:2">2:2</span> This was the first enrollment made when
Quirinius was governor of Syria.

<span id="an_2:3">2:3</span> All went to enroll themselves, everyone to
his own city.

<span id="an_2:4">2:4</span> Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of
the city of Nazareth, into Judea, to the city of David, which is called
Bethlehem, because he was of the house and family of David;

<span id="an_2:5">2:5</span> to enroll himself with Mary, who was
pledged to be married to him as wife, being pregnant.

<span id="an_2:6">2:6</span> It happened, while they were there, that
the day had come that she should give birth.

<span id="an_2:7">2:7</span> She brought forth her firstborn son, and
she wrapped him in bands of cloth, and laid him in a feeding trough,
because there was no room for them in the inn.

<span id="an_2:8">2:8</span> There were shepherds in the same country
staying in the field, and keeping watch by night over their flock.

<span id="an_2:9">2:9</span> Behold, an angel of the Lord stood by them,
and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were terrified.

<span id="an_2:10">2:10</span> The angel said to them, "Don't be afraid,
for behold, I bring you good news of great joy which will be to all the
people.

<span id="an_2:11">2:11</span> For there is born to you, this day, in
the city of David, a Savior, who is Christ the Lord.

<span id="an_2:12">2:12</span> This is the sign to you: you will find a
baby wrapped in strips of cloth, lying in a feeding trough."

<span id="an_2:13">2:13</span> Suddenly, there was with the angel a
multitude of the heavenly army praising God, and saying,

<span id="an_2:14">2:14</span> "Glory to God in the highest, on earth
peace, good will toward men."

<span id="an_2:15">2:15</span> It happened, when the angels went away
from them into the sky, that the shepherds said one to another, "Let's
go to Bethlehem, now, and see this thing that has happened, which the
Lord has made known to us."

<span id="an_2:16">2:16</span> They came with haste, and found both Mary
and Joseph, and the baby was lying in the feeding trough.

<span id="an_2:17">2:17</span> When they saw it, they publicized widely
the saying which was spoken to them about this child.

<span id="an_2:18">2:18</span> All who heard it wondered at the things
which were spoken to them by the shepherds.

<span id="an_2:19">2:19</span> But Mary kept all these sayings,
pondering them in her heart.

<span id="an_2:20">2:20</span> The shepherds returned, glorifying and
praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen, just as it
was told them.

<span id="an_2:21">2:21</span> When eight days were fulfilled for the
circumcision of the child, his name was called Jesus, which was given by
the angel before he was conceived in the womb.

<span id="an_2:22">2:22</span> When the days of their purification
according to the law of Moses were fulfilled, they brought him up to
Jerusalem, to present him to the Lord

<span id="an_2:23">2:23</span> (as it is written in the law of the Lord,
"Every male who opens the womb shall be called holy to the Lord"),

<span id="an_2:24">2:24</span> and to offer a sacrifice according to
that which is said in the law of the Lord, "A pair of turtledoves, or
two young pigeons."

<span id="an_2:25">2:25</span> Behold, there was a man in Jerusalem
whose name was Simeon. This man was righteous and devout, looking for
the consolation of Israel, and the Holy Spirit was on him.

<span id="an_2:26">2:26</span> It had been revealed to him by the Holy
Spirit that he should not see death before he had seen the Lord's
Christ.

<span id="an_2:27">2:27</span> He came in the Spirit into the temple.
When the parents brought in the child, Jesus, that they might do
concerning him according to the custom of the law,

<span id="an_2:28">2:28</span> then he received him into his arms, and
blessed God, and said,

<span id="an_2:29">2:29</span> "Now you are releasing your servant,
Master, according to your word, in peace;

<span id="an_2:30">2:30</span> for my eyes have seen your salvation,

<span id="an_2:31">2:31</span> which you have prepared before the face
of all peoples;

<span id="an_2:32">2:32</span> a light for revelation to the nations,
and the glory of your people Israel."

<span id="an_2:33">2:33</span> Joseph and his mother were marveling at
the things which were spoken concerning him,

<span id="an_2:34">2:34</span> and Simeon blessed them, and said to
Mary, his mother, "Behold, this child is set for the falling and the
rising of many in Israel, and for a sign which is spoken against.

<span id="an_2:35">2:35</span> Yes, a sword will pierce through your own
soul, that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed."

<span id="an_2:36">2:36</span> There was one Anna, a prophetess, the
daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher (she was of a great age,
having lived with a husband seven years from her virginity,

<span id="an_2:37">2:37</span> and she had been a widow for about
eighty-four years), who didn't depart from the temple, worshipping with
fastings and petitions night and day.

<span id="an_2:38">2:38</span> Coming up at that very hour, she gave
thanks to the Lord, and spoke of him to all those who were looking for
redemption in Jerusalem.

<span id="an_2:39">2:39</span> When they had accomplished all things
that were according to the law of the Lord, they returned into Galilee,
to their own city, Nazareth.

<span id="an_2:40">2:40</span> The child was growing, and was becoming
strong in spirit, being filled with wisdom, and the grace of God was
upon him.

<span id="an_2:41">2:41</span> His parents went every year to Jerusalem
at the feast of the Passover.

<span id="an_2:42">2:42</span> When he was twelve years old, they went
up to Jerusalem according to the custom of the feast,

<span id="an_2:43">2:43</span> and when they had fulfilled the days, as
they were returning, the boy Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem. Joseph
and his mother didn't know it,

<span id="an_2:44">2:44</span> but supposing him to be in the company,
they went a day's journey, and they looked for him among their relatives
and acquaintances.

<span id="an_2:45">2:45</span> When they didn't find him, they returned
to Jerusalem, looking for him.

<span id="an_2:46">2:46</span> It happened after three days they found
him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the teachers, both listening
to them, and asking them questions.

<span id="an_2:47">2:47</span> All who heard him were amazed at his
understanding and his answers.

<span id="an_2:48">2:48</span> When they saw him, they were astonished,
and his mother said to him, "Son, why have you treated us this way?
Behold, your father and I were anxiously looking for you."

<span id="an_2:49">2:49</span> He said to them, "Why were you looking
for me? Didn't you know that I must be in my Father's house?"

<span id="an_2:50">2:50</span> They didn't understand the saying which
he spoke to them.

<span id="an_2:51">2:51</span> And he went down with them, and came to
Nazareth. He was subject to them, and his mother kept all these sayings
in her heart.

<span id="an_2:52">2:52</span> And Jesus increased in wisdom and
stature, and in favor with God and men.

<span id="an_3:1">3:1</span> Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of
Tiberius Caesar, Pontius Pilate being governor of Judea, and Herod being
tetrarch of Galilee, and his brother Philip tetrarch of the region of
Ituraea and Trachonitis, and Lysanias tetrarch of Abilene,

<span id="an_3:2">3:2</span> in the high priesthood of Annas and
Caiaphas, the word of God came to John, the son of Zacharias, in the
wilderness.

<span id="an_3:3">3:3</span> He came into all the region around the
Jordan, preaching the baptism of repentance for remission of sins.

<span id="an_3:4">3:4</span> As it is written in the book of the words
of Isaiah the prophet, "The voice of one crying in the wilderness, 'Make
ready the way of the Lord. Make his paths straight.

<span id="an_3:5">3:5</span> Every valley will be filled. Every mountain
and hill will be brought low. The crooked will become straight, and the
rough ways smooth.

<span id="an_3:6">3:6</span> All flesh will see God's salvation.'"

<span id="an_3:7">3:7</span> He said therefore to the multitudes who
went out to be baptized by him, "You offspring of vipers, who warned you
to flee from the wrath to come?

<span id="an_3:8">3:8</span> Bring forth therefore fruits worthy of
repentance, and don't begin to say among yourselves, 'We have Abraham
for our father;' for I tell you that God is able to raise up children to
Abraham from these stones!

<span id="an_3:9">3:9</span> Even now the axe also lies at the root of
the trees. Every tree therefore that doesn't bring forth good fruit is
cut down, and thrown into the fire."

<span id="an_3:10">3:10</span> The multitudes asked him, "What then must
we do?"

<span id="an_3:11">3:11</span> He answered them, "He who has two coats,
let him give to him who has none. He who has food, let him do likewise."

<span id="an_3:12">3:12</span> Tax collectors also came to be baptized,
and they said to him, "Teacher, what must we do?"

<span id="an_3:13">3:13</span> He said to them, "Collect no more than
that which is appointed to you."

<span id="an_3:14">3:14</span> Soldiers also asked him, saying, "What
about us? What must we do?" He said to them, "Extort from no one by
violence, neither accuse anyone wrongfully. Be content with your wages."

<span id="an_3:15">3:15</span> As the people were in expectation, and
all men reasoned in their hearts concerning John, whether perhaps he was
the Christ,

<span id="an_3:16">3:16</span> John answered them all, "I indeed baptize
you with water, but he comes who is mightier than I, the latchet of
whose sandals I am not worthy to loosen. He will baptize you in the Holy
Spirit and fire,

<span id="an_3:17">3:17</span> whose fan is in his hand, and he will
thoroughly cleanse his threshing floor, and will gather the wheat into
his barn; but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire."

<span id="an_3:18">3:18</span> Then with many other exhortations he
preached good news to the people,

<span id="an_3:19">3:19</span> but Herod the tetrarch, being reproved by
him for Herodias, his brother's wife, and for all the evil things which
Herod had done,

<span id="an_3:20">3:20</span> added this also to them all, that he shut
up John in prison.

<span id="an_3:21">3:21</span> Now it happened, when all the people were
baptized, Jesus also had been baptized, and was praying. The sky was
opened,

<span id="an_3:22">3:22</span> and the Holy Spirit descended in a bodily
form as a dove on him; and a voice came out of the sky, saying "You are
my beloved Son. In you I am well pleased."

<span id="an_3:23">3:23</span> Jesus himself, when he began to teach,
was about thirty years old, being the son (as was supposed) of Joseph,
the son of Heli,

<span id="an_3:24">3:24</span> the son of Matthat, the son of Levi, the
son of Melchi, the son of Jannai, the son of Joseph,

<span id="an_3:25">3:25</span> the son of Mattathias, the son of Amos,
the son of Nahum, the son of Esli, the son of Naggai,

<span id="an_3:26">3:26</span> the son of Maath, the son of Mattathias,
the son of Semein, the son of Joseph, the son of Judah,

<span id="an_3:27">3:27</span> the son of Joanan, the son of Rhesa, the
son of Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, the son of Neri,

<span id="an_3:28">3:28</span> the son of Melchi, the son of Addi, the
son of Cosam, the son of Elmodam, the son of Er,

<span id="an_3:29">3:29</span> the son of Jose, the son of Eliezer, the
son of Jorim, the son of Matthat, the son of Levi,

<span id="an_3:30">3:30</span> the son of Simeon, the son of Judah, the
son of Joseph, the son of Jonan, the son of Eliakim,

<span id="an_3:31">3:31</span> the son of Melea, the son of Menan, the
son of Mattatha, the son of Nathan, the son of David,

<span id="an_3:32">3:32</span> the son of Jesse, the son of Obed, the
son of Boaz, the son of Salmon, the son of Nahshon,

<span id="an_3:33">3:33</span> the son of Amminadab, the son of Aram,
the son of Hezron, the son of Perez, the son of Judah,

<span id="an_3:34">3:34</span> the son of Jacob, the son of Isaac, the
son of Abraham, the son of Terah, the son of Nahor,

<span id="an_3:35">3:35</span> the son of Serug, the son of Reu, the son
of Peleg, the son of Eber, the son of Shelah,

<span id="an_3:36">3:36</span> the son of Cainan, the son of Arphaxad,
the son of Shem, the son of Noah, the son of Lamech,

<span id="an_3:37">3:37</span> the son of Methuselah, the son of Enoch,
the son of Jared, the son of Mahalaleel, the son of Cainan,

<span id="an_3:38">3:38</span> the son of Enos, the son of Seth, the son
of Adam, the son of God.

<span id="an_4:1">4:1</span> Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, returned
from the Jordan, and was led by the Spirit into the wilderness

<span id="an_4:2">4:2</span> for forty days, being tempted by the devil.
He ate nothing in those days. Afterward, when they were completed, he
was hungry.

<span id="an_4:3">4:3</span> The devil said to him, "If you are the Son
of God, command this stone to become bread."

<span id="an_4:4">4:4</span> Jesus answered him, saying, "It is written,
'Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word of God.'"

<span id="an_4:5">4:5</span> The devil, leading him up on a high
mountain, showed him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time.

<span id="an_4:6">4:6</span> The devil said to him, "I will give you all
this authority, and their glory, for it has been delivered to me; and I
give it to whomever I want.

<span id="an_4:7">4:7</span> If you therefore will worship before me, it
will all be yours."

<span id="an_4:8">4:8</span> Jesus answered him, "Get behind me Satan!
For it is written, 'You shall worship the Lord your God, and you shall
serve him only.'"

<span id="an_4:9">4:9</span> He led him to Jerusalem, and set him on the
pinnacle of the temple, and said to him, "If you are the Son of God,
cast yourself down from here,

<span id="an_4:10">4:10</span> for it is written, 'He will put his
angels in charge of you, to guard you;'

<span id="an_4:11">4:11</span> and, 'On their hands they will bear you
up, lest perhaps you dash your foot against a stone.'"

<span id="an_4:12">4:12</span> Jesus answering, said to him, "It has
been said, 'You shall not tempt the Lord your God.'"

<span id="an_4:13">4:13</span> When the devil had completed every
temptation, he departed from him until another time.

<span id="an_4:14">4:14</span> Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit
into Galilee, and news about him spread through all the surrounding
area.

<span id="an_4:15">4:15</span> He taught in their synagogues, being
glorified by all.

<span id="an_4:16">4:16</span> He came to Nazareth, where he had been
brought up. He entered, as was his custom, into the synagogue on the
Sabbath day, and stood up to read.

<span id="an_4:17">4:17</span> The book of the prophet Isaiah was handed
to him. He opened the book, and found the place where it was written,

<span id="an_4:18">4:18</span> "The Spirit of the Lord is on me, because
he has anointed me to preach good news to the poor. He has sent me to
heal the brokenhearted, to proclaim release to the captives, recovering
of sight to the blind, to deliver those who are crushed,

<span id="an_4:19">4:19</span> and to proclaim the acceptable year of
the Lord."

<span id="an_4:20">4:20</span> He closed the book, gave it back to the
attendant, and sat down. The eyes of all in the synagogue were fastened
on him.

<span id="an_4:21">4:21</span> He began to tell them, "Today, this
Scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing."

<span id="an_4:22">4:22</span> All testified about him, and wondered at
the gracious words which proceeded out of his mouth, and they said,
"Isn't this Joseph's son?"

<span id="an_4:23">4:23</span> He said to them, "Doubtless you will tell
me this parable, 'Physician, heal yourself! Whatever we have heard done
at Capernaum, do also here in your hometown.'"

<span id="an_4:24">4:24</span> He said, "Most certainly I tell you, no
prophet is acceptable in his hometown.

<span id="an_4:25">4:25</span> But truly I tell you, there were many
widows in Israel in the days of Elijah, when the sky was shut up three
years and six months, when a great famine came over all the land.

<span id="an_4:26">4:26</span> Elijah was sent to none of them, except
to Zarephath, in the land of Sidon, to a woman who was a widow.

<span id="an_4:27">4:27</span> There were many lepers in Israel in the
time of Elisha the prophet, yet not one of them was cleansed, except
Naaman, the Syrian."

<span id="an_4:28">4:28</span> They were all filled with wrath in the
synagogue, as they heard these things.

<span id="an_4:29">4:29</span> They rose up, threw him out of the city,
and led him to the brow of the hill that their city was built on, that
they might throw him off the cliff.

<span id="an_4:30">4:30</span> But he, passing through the midst of
them, went his way.

<span id="an_4:31">4:31</span> He came down to Capernaum, a city of
Galilee. He was teaching them on the Sabbath day,

<span id="an_4:32">4:32</span> and they were astonished at his teaching,
for his word was with authority.

<span id="an_4:33">4:33</span> In the synagogue there was a man who had
a spirit of an unclean demon, and he cried out with a loud voice,

<span id="an_4:34">4:34</span> saying, "Ah! what have we to do with you,
Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know you who you are:
the Holy One of God!"

<span id="an_4:35">4:35</span> Jesus rebuked him, saying, "Be silent,
and come out of him!" When the demon had thrown him down in their midst,
he came out of him, having done him no harm.

<span id="an_4:36">4:36</span> Amazement came on all, and they spoke
together, one with another, saying, "What is this word? For with
authority and power he commands the unclean spirits, and they come out!"

<span id="an_4:37">4:37</span> News about him went out into every place
of the surrounding region.

<span id="an_4:38">4:38</span> He rose up from the synagogue, and
entered into Simon's house. Simon's mother-in-law was afflicted with a
great fever, and they begged him for her.

<span id="an_4:39">4:39</span> He stood over her, and rebuked the fever;
and it left her. Immediately she rose up and served them.

<span id="an_4:40">4:40</span> When the sun was setting, all those who
had any sick with various diseases brought them to him; and he laid his
hands on every one of them, and healed them.

<span id="an_4:41">4:41</span> Demons also came out from many, crying
out, and saying, "You are the Christ, the Son of God!" Rebuking them, he
didn't allow them to speak, because they knew that he was the Christ.

<span id="an_4:42">4:42</span> When it was day, he departed and went
into an uninhabited place, and the multitudes looked for him, and came
to him, and held on to him, so that he wouldn't go away from them.

<span id="an_4:43">4:43</span> But he said to them, "I must preach the
good news of the Kingdom of God to the other cities also. For this
reason I have been sent."

<span id="an_4:44">4:44</span> He was preaching in the synagogues of
Galilee.

<span id="an_5:1">5:1</span> Now it happened, while the multitude
pressed on him and heard the word of God, that he was standing by the
lake of Gennesaret.

<span id="an_5:2">5:2</span> He saw two boats standing by the lake, but
the fishermen had gone out of them, and were washing their nets.

<span id="an_5:3">5:3</span> He entered into one of the boats, which was
Simon's, and asked him to put out a little from the land. He sat down
and taught the multitudes from the boat.

<span id="an_5:4">5:4</span> When he had finished speaking, he said to
Simon, "Put out into the deep, and let down your nets for a catch."

<span id="an_5:5">5:5</span> Simon answered him, "Master, we worked all
night, and took nothing; but at your word I will let down the net."

<span id="an_5:6">5:6</span> When they had done this, they caught a
great multitude of fish, and their net was breaking.

<span id="an_5:7">5:7</span> They beckoned to their partners in the
other boat, that they should come and help them. They came, and filled
both boats, so that they began to sink.

<span id="an_5:8">5:8</span> But Simon Peter, when he saw it, fell down
at Jesus' knees, saying, "Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, Lord."

<span id="an_5:9">5:9</span> For he was amazed, and all who were with
him, at the catch of fish which they had caught;

<span id="an_5:10">5:10</span> and so also were James and John, sons of
Zebedee, who were partners with Simon. Jesus said to Simon, "Don't be
afraid. From now on you will be catching people alive."

<span id="an_5:11">5:11</span> When they had brought their boats to
land, they left everything, and followed him.

<span id="an_5:12">5:12</span> It happened, while he was in one of the
cities, behold, there was a man full of leprosy. When he saw Jesus, he
fell on his face, and begged him, saying, "Lord, if you want to, you can
make me clean."

<span id="an_5:13">5:13</span> He stretched out his hand, and touched
him, saying, "I want to. Be made clean." Immediately the leprosy left
him.

<span id="an_5:14">5:14</span> He commanded him to tell no one, "But go
your way, and show yourself to the priest, and offer for your cleansing
according to what Moses commanded, for a testimony to them."

<span id="an_5:15">5:15</span> But the report concerning him spread much
more, and great multitudes came together to hear, and to be healed by
him of their infirmities.

<span id="an_5:16">5:16</span> But he withdrew himself into the desert,
and prayed.

<span id="an_5:17">5:17</span> It happened on one of those days, that he
was teaching; and there were Pharisees and teachers of the law sitting
by, who had come out of every village of Galilee, Judea, and Jerusalem.
The power of the Lord was with him to heal them.

<span id="an_5:18">5:18</span> Behold, men brought a paralyzed man on a
cot, and they sought to bring him in to lay before Jesus.

<span id="an_5:19">5:19</span> Not finding a way to bring him in because
of the multitude, they went up to the housetop, and let him down through
the tiles with his cot into the midst before Jesus.

<span id="an_5:20">5:20</span> Seeing their faith, he said to him, "Man,
your sins are forgiven you."

<span id="an_5:21">5:21</span> The scribes and the Pharisees began to
reason, saying, "Who is this that speaks blasphemies? Who can forgive
sins, but God alone?"

<span id="an_5:22">5:22</span> But Jesus, perceiving their thoughts,
answered them, "Why are you reasoning so in your hearts?

<span id="an_5:23">5:23</span> Which is easier to say, 'Your sins are
forgiven you;' or to say, 'Arise and walk?'

<span id="an_5:24">5:24</span> But that you may know that the Son of Man
has authority on earth to forgive sins" (he said to the paralyzed man),
"I tell you, arise, and take up your cot, and go to your house."

<span id="an_5:25">5:25</span> Immediately he rose up before them, and
took up that which he was laying on, and departed to his house,
glorifying God.

<span id="an_5:26">5:26</span> Amazement took hold on all, and they
glorified God. They were filled with fear, saying, "We have seen strange
things today."

<span id="an_5:27">5:27</span> After these things he went out, and saw a
tax collector named Levi sitting at the tax office, and said to him,
"Follow me!"

<span id="an_5:28">5:28</span> He left everything, and rose up and
followed him.

<span id="an_5:29">5:29</span> Levi made a great feast for him in his
house. There was a great crowd of tax collectors and others who were
reclining with them.

<span id="an_5:30">5:30</span> Their scribes and the Pharisees murmured
against his disciples, saying, "Why do you eat and drink with the tax
collectors and sinners?"

<span id="an_5:31">5:31</span> Jesus answered them, "Those who are
healthy have no need for a physician, but those who are sick do.

<span id="an_5:32">5:32</span> I have not come to call the righteous,
but sinners to repentance."

<span id="an_5:33">5:33</span> They said to him, "Why do John's
disciples often fast and pray, likewise also the disciples of the
Pharisees, but yours eat and drink?"

<span id="an_5:34">5:34</span> He said to them, "Can you make the
friends of the bridegroom fast, while the bridegroom is with them?

<span id="an_5:35">5:35</span> But the days will come when the
bridegroom will be taken away from them. Then they will fast in those
days."

<span id="an_5:36">5:36</span> He also told a parable to them. "No one
puts a piece from a new garment on an old garment, or else he will tear
the new, and also the piece from the new will not match the old.

<span id="an_5:37">5:37</span> No one puts new wine into old wineskins,
or else the new wine will burst the skins, and it will be spilled, and
the skins will be destroyed.

<span id="an_5:38">5:38</span> But new wine must be put into fresh
wineskins, and both are preserved.

<span id="an_5:39">5:39</span> No man having drunk old wine immediately
desires new, for he says, 'The old is better.'"

<span id="an_6:1">6:1</span> Now it happened on the second Sabbath after
the first, that he was going through the grain fields. His disciples
plucked the heads of grain, and ate, rubbing them in their hands.

<span id="an_6:2">6:2</span> But some of the Pharisees said to them,
"Why do you do that which is not lawful to do on the Sabbath day?"

<span id="an_6:3">6:3</span> Jesus, answering them, said, "Haven't you
read what David did when he was hungry, he, and those who were with him;

<span id="an_6:4">6:4</span> how he entered into the house of God, and
took and ate the show bread, and gave also to those who were with him,
which is not lawful to eat except for the priests alone?"

<span id="an_6:5">6:5</span> He said to them, "The Son of Man is lord of
the Sabbath."

<span id="an_6:6">6:6</span> It also happened on another Sabbath that he
entered into the synagogue and taught. There was a man there, and his
right hand was withered.

<span id="an_6:7">6:7</span> The scribes and the Pharisees watched him,
to see whether he would heal on the Sabbath, that they might find an
accusation against him.

<span id="an_6:8">6:8</span> But he knew their thoughts; and he said to
the man who had the withered hand, "Rise up, and stand in the middle."
He arose and stood.

<span id="an_6:9">6:9</span> Then Jesus said to them, "I will ask you
something: Is it lawful on the Sabbath to do good, or to do harm? To
save a life, or to kill?"

<span id="an_6:10">6:10</span> He looked around at them all, and said to
the man, "Stretch out your hand." He did, and his hand was restored as
sound as the other.

<span id="an_6:11">6:11</span> But they were filled with rage, and
talked with one another about what they might do to Jesus.

<span id="an_6:12">6:12</span> It happened in these days, that he went
out to the mountain to pray, and he continued all night in prayer to
God.

<span id="an_6:13">6:13</span> When it was day, he called his disciples,
and from them he chose twelve, whom he also named apostles:

<span id="an_6:14">6:14</span> Simon, whom he also named Peter; Andrew,
his brother; James; John; Philip; Bartholomew;

<span id="an_6:15">6:15</span> Matthew; Thomas; James, the son of
Alphaeus; Simon, who was called the Zealot;

<span id="an_6:16">6:16</span> Judas the son of James; and Judas
Iscariot, who also became a traitor.

<span id="an_6:17">6:17</span> He came down with them, and stood on a
level place, with a crowd of his disciples, and a great number of the
people from all Judea and Jerusalem, and the sea coast of Tyre and
Sidon, who came to hear him and to be healed of their diseases;

<span id="an_6:18">6:18</span> as well as those who were troubled by
unclean spirits, and they were being healed.

<span id="an_6:19">6:19</span> All the multitude sought to touch him,
for power came out from him and healed them all.

<span id="an_6:20">6:20</span> He lifted up his eyes to his disciples,
and said, "Blessed are you who are poor, for yours is the Kingdom of
God.

<span id="an_6:21">6:21</span> Blessed are you who hunger now, for you
will be filled. Blessed are you who weep now, for you will laugh.

<span id="an_6:22">6:22</span> Blessed are you when men shall hate you,
and when they shall exclude and mock you, and throw out your name as
evil, for the Son of Man's sake.

<span id="an_6:23">6:23</span> Rejoice in that day, and leap for joy,
for behold, your reward is great in heaven, for their fathers did the
same thing to the prophets.

<span id="an_6:24">6:24</span> "But woe to you who are rich! For you
have received your consolation.

<span id="an_6:25">6:25</span> Woe to you, you who are full now, for you
will be hungry. Woe to you who laugh now, for you will mourn and weep.

<span id="an_6:26">6:26</span> Woe, when men speak well of you, for
their fathers did the same thing to the false prophets.

<span id="an_6:27">6:27</span> "But I tell you who hear: love your
enemies, do good to those who hate you,

<span id="an_6:28">6:28</span> bless those who curse you, and pray for
those who mistreat you.

<span id="an_6:29">6:29</span> To him who strikes you on the cheek,
offer also the other; and from him who takes away your cloak, don't
withhold your coat also.

<span id="an_6:30">6:30</span> Give to everyone who asks you, and don't
ask him who takes away your goods to give them back again.

<span id="an_6:31">6:31</span> "As you would like people to do to you,
do exactly so to them.

<span id="an_6:32">6:32</span> If you love those who love you, what
credit is that to you? For even sinners love those who love them.

<span id="an_6:33">6:33</span> If you do good to those who do good to
you, what credit is that to you? For even sinners do the same.

<span id="an_6:34">6:34</span> If you lend to those from whom you hope
to receive, what credit is that to you? Even sinners lend to sinners, to
receive back as much.

<span id="an_6:35">6:35</span> But love your enemies, and do good, and
lend, expecting nothing back; and your reward will be great, and you
will be children of the Most High; for he is kind toward the unthankful
and evil.

<span id="an_6:36">6:36</span> Therefore be merciful, even as your
Father is also merciful.

<span id="an_6:37">6:37</span> Don't judge, and you won't be judged.
Don't condemn, and you won't be condemned. Set free, and you will be set
free.

<span id="an_6:38">6:38</span> "Give, and it will be given to you: good
measure, pressed down, shaken together, and running over, will be given
to you. For with the same measure you measure it will be measured back
to you."

<span id="an_6:39">6:39</span> He spoke a parable to them. "Can the
blind guide the blind? Won't they both fall into a pit?

<span id="an_6:40">6:40</span> A disciple is not above his teacher, but
everyone when he is fully trained will be like his teacher.

<span id="an_6:41">6:41</span> Why do you see the speck of chaff that is
in your brother's eye, but don't consider the beam that is in your own
eye?

<span id="an_6:42">6:42</span> Or how can you tell your brother,
'Brother, let me remove the speck of chaff that is in your eye,' when
you yourself don't see the beam that is in your own eye? You hypocrite!
First remove the beam from your own eye, and then you can see clearly to
remove the speck of chaff that is in your brother's eye.

<span id="an_6:43">6:43</span> For there is no good tree that brings
forth rotten fruit; nor again a rotten tree that brings forth good
fruit.

<span id="an_6:44">6:44</span> For each tree is known by its own fruit.
For people don't gather figs from thorns, nor do they gather grapes from
a bramble bush.

<span id="an_6:45">6:45</span> The good man out of the good treasure of
his heart brings out that which is good, and the evil man out of the
evil treasure of his heart brings out that which is evil, for out of the
abundance of the heart, his mouth speaks.

<span id="an_6:46">6:46</span> "Why do you call me, 'Lord, Lord,' and
don't do the things which I say?

<span id="an_6:47">6:47</span> Everyone who comes to me, and hears my
words, and does them, I will show you who he is like.

<span id="an_6:48">6:48</span> He is like a man building a house, who
dug and went deep, and laid a foundation on the rock. When a flood
arose, the stream broke against that house, and could not shake it,
because it was founded on the rock.

<span id="an_6:49">6:49</span> But he who hears, and doesn't do, is like
a man who built a house on the earth without a foundation, against which
the stream broke, and immediately it fell, and the ruin of that house
was great."

<span id="an_7:1">7:1</span> After he had finished speaking in the
hearing of the people, he entered into Capernaum.

<span id="an_7:2">7:2</span> A certain centurion's servant, who was dear
to him, was sick and at the point of death.

<span id="an_7:3">7:3</span> When he heard about Jesus, he sent to him
elders of the Jews, asking him to come and save his servant.

<span id="an_7:4">7:4</span> When they came to Jesus, they begged him
earnestly, saying, "He is worthy for you to do this for him,

<span id="an_7:5">7:5</span> for he loves our nation, and he built our
synagogue for us."

<span id="an_7:6">7:6</span> Jesus went with them. When he was now not
far from the house, the centurion sent friends to him, saying to him,
"Lord, don't trouble yourself, for I am not worthy for you to come under
my roof.

<span id="an_7:7">7:7</span> Therefore I didn't even think myself worthy
to come to you; but say the word, and my servant will be healed.

<span id="an_7:8">7:8</span> For I also am a man placed under authority,
having under myself soldiers. I tell this one, 'Go!' and he goes; and to
another, 'Come!' and he comes; and to my servant, 'Do this,' and he does
it."

<span id="an_7:9">7:9</span> When Jesus heard these things, he marveled
at him, and turned and said to the multitude who followed him, "I tell
you, I have not found such great faith, no, not in Israel."

<span id="an_7:10">7:10</span> Those who were sent, returning to the
house, found that the servant who had been sick was well.

<span id="an_7:11">7:11</span> It happened soon afterwards, that he went
to a city called Nain. Many of his disciples, along with a great
multitude, went with him.

<span id="an_7:12">7:12</span> Now when he drew near to the gate of the
city, behold, one who was dead was carried out, the only son of his
mother, and she was a widow. Many people of the city were with her.

<span id="an_7:13">7:13</span> When the Lord saw her, he had compassion
on her, and said to her, "Don't cry."

<span id="an_7:14">7:14</span> He came near and touched the coffin, and
the bearers stood still. He said, "Young man, I tell you, arise!"

<span id="an_7:15">7:15</span> He who was dead sat up, and began to
speak. And he gave him to his mother.

<span id="an_7:16">7:16</span> Fear took hold of all, and they glorified
God, saying, "A great prophet has arisen among us!" and, "God has
visited his people!"

<span id="an_7:17">7:17</span> This report went out concerning him in
the whole of Judea, and in all the surrounding region.

<span id="an_7:18">7:18</span> The disciples of John told him about all
these things.

<span id="an_7:19">7:19</span> John, calling to himself two of his
disciples, sent them to Jesus, saying, "Are you the one who is coming,
or should we look for another?"

<span id="an_7:20">7:20</span> When the men had come to him, they said,
"John the Baptizer has sent us to you, saying, 'Are you he who comes, or
should we look for another?'"

<span id="an_7:21">7:21</span> In that hour he cured many of diseases
and plagues and evil spirits; and to many who were blind he gave sight.

<span id="an_7:22">7:22</span> Jesus answered them, "Go and tell John
the things which you have seen and heard: that the blind receive their
sight, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead
are raised up, and the poor have good news preached to them.

<span id="an_7:23">7:23</span> Blessed is he who is not offended by me."

<span id="an_7:24">7:24</span> When John's messengers had departed, he
began to tell the multitudes about John, "What did you go out into the
wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind?

<span id="an_7:25">7:25</span> But what did you go out to see? A man
clothed in soft clothing? Behold, those who are gorgeously dressed, and
live delicately, are in kings' courts.

<span id="an_7:26">7:26</span> But what did you go out to see? A
prophet? Yes, I tell you, and much more than a prophet.

<span id="an_7:27">7:27</span> This is he of whom it is written,
'Behold, I send my messenger before your face, who will prepare your way
before you.'

<span id="an_7:28">7:28</span> "For I tell you, among those who are born
of women there is not a greater prophet than John the Baptizer, yet he
who is least in the Kingdom of God is greater than he."

<span id="an_7:29">7:29</span> When all the people and the tax
collectors heard this, they declared God to be just, having been
baptized with John's baptism.

<span id="an_7:30">7:30</span> But the Pharisees and the lawyers
rejected the counsel of God, not being baptized by him themselves.

<span id="an_7:31">7:31</span> "To what then will I liken the people of
this generation? What are they like?

<span id="an_7:32">7:32</span> They are like children who sit in the
marketplace, and call one to another, saying, 'We piped to you, and you
didn't dance. We mourned, and you didn't weep.'

<span id="an_7:33">7:33</span> For John the Baptizer came neither eating
bread nor drinking wine, and you say, 'He has a demon.'

<span id="an_7:34">7:34</span> The Son of Man has come eating and
drinking, and you say, 'Behold, a gluttonous man, and a drunkard; a
friend of tax collectors and sinners!'

<span id="an_7:35">7:35</span> Wisdom is justified by all her children."

<span id="an_7:36">7:36</span> One of the Pharisees invited him to eat
with him. He entered into the Pharisee's house, and sat at the table.

<span id="an_7:37">7:37</span> Behold, a woman in the city who was a
sinner, when she knew that he was reclining in the Pharisee's house, she
brought an alabaster jar of ointment.

<span id="an_7:38">7:38</span> Standing behind at his feet weeping, she
began to wet his feet with her tears, and she wiped them with the hair
of her head, kissed his feet, and anointed them with the ointment.

<span id="an_7:39">7:39</span> Now when the Pharisee who had invited him
saw it, he said to himself, "This man, if he were a prophet, would have
perceived who and what kind of woman this is who touches him, that she
is a sinner."

<span id="an_7:40">7:40</span> Jesus answered him, "Simon, I have
something to tell you." He said, "Teacher, say on."

<span id="an_7:41">7:41</span> "A certain lender had two debtors. The
one owed five hundred denarii, and the other fifty.

<span id="an_7:42">7:42</span> When they couldn't pay, he forgave them
both. Which of them therefore will love him most?"

<span id="an_7:43">7:43</span> Simon answered, "He, I suppose, to whom
he forgave the most." He said to him, "You have judged correctly."

<span id="an_7:44">7:44</span> Turning to the woman, he said to Simon,
"Do you see this woman? I entered into your house, and you gave me no
water for my feet, but she has wet my feet with her tears, and wiped
them with the hair of her head.

<span id="an_7:45">7:45</span> You gave me no kiss, but she, since the
time I came in, has not ceased to kiss my feet.

<span id="an_7:46">7:46</span> You didn't anoint my head with oil, but
she has anointed my feet with ointment.

<span id="an_7:47">7:47</span> Therefore I tell you, her sins, which are
many, are forgiven, for she loved much. But to whom little is forgiven,
the same loves little."

<span id="an_7:48">7:48</span> He said to her, "Your sins are forgiven."

<span id="an_7:49">7:49</span> Those who sat at the table with him began
to say to themselves, "Who is this who even forgives sins?"

<span id="an_7:50">7:50</span> He said to the woman, "Your faith has
saved you. Go in peace."

<span id="an_8:1">8:1</span> It happened soon afterwards, that he went
about through cities and villages, preaching and bringing the good news
of the Kingdom of God. With him were the twelve,

<span id="an_8:2">8:2</span> and certain women who had been healed of
evil spirits and infirmities: Mary who was called Magdalene, from whom
seven demons had gone out;

<span id="an_8:3">8:3</span> and Joanna, the wife of Chuzas, Herod's
steward; Susanna; and many others; who served them from their
possessions.

<span id="an_8:4">8:4</span> When a great multitude came together, and
people from every city were coming to him, he spoke by a parable.

<span id="an_8:5">8:5</span> "The farmer went out to sow his seed. As he
sowed, some fell along the road, and it was trampled under foot, and the
birds of the sky devoured it.

<span id="an_8:6">8:6</span> Other seed fell on the rock, and as soon as
it grew, it withered away, because it had no moisture.

<span id="an_8:7">8:7</span> Other fell amid the thorns, and the thorns
grew with it, and choked it.

<span id="an_8:8">8:8</span> Other fell into the good ground, and grew,
and brought forth fruit one hundred times." As he said these things, he
called out, "He who has ears to hear, let him hear!"

<span id="an_8:9">8:9</span> Then his disciples asked him, "What does
this parable mean?"

<span id="an_8:10">8:10</span> He said, "To you it is given to know the
mysteries of the Kingdom of God, but to the rest in parables; that
'seeing they may not see, and hearing they may not understand.'

<span id="an_8:11">8:11</span> Now the parable is this: The seed is the
word of God.

<span id="an_8:12">8:12</span> Those along the road are those who hear,
then the devil comes, and takes away the word from their heart, that
they may not believe and be saved.

<span id="an_8:13">8:13</span> Those on the rock are they who, when they
hear, receive the word with joy; but these have no root, who believe for
a while, then fall away in time of temptation.

<span id="an_8:14">8:14</span> That which fell among the thorns, these
are those who have heard, and as they go on their way they are choked
with cares, riches, and pleasures of life, and bring no fruit to
maturity.

<span id="an_8:15">8:15</span> That in the good ground, these are such
as in an honest and good heart, having heard the word, hold it tightly,
and bring forth fruit with patience.

<span id="an_8:16">8:16</span> "No one, when he has lit a lamp, covers
it with a container, or puts it under a bed; but puts it on a stand,
that those who enter in may see the light.

<span id="an_8:17">8:17</span> For nothing is hidden, that will not be
revealed; nor anything secret, that will not be known and come to light.

<span id="an_8:18">8:18</span> Be careful therefore how you hear. For
whoever has, to him will be given; and whoever doesn't have, from him
will be taken away even that which he thinks he has."

<span id="an_8:19">8:19</span> His mother and brothers came to him, and
they could not come near him for the crowd.

<span id="an_8:20">8:20</span> It was told him by some saying, "Your
mother and your brothers stand outside, desiring to see you."

<span id="an_8:21">8:21</span> But he answered them, "My mother and my
brothers are these who hear the word of God, and do it."

<span id="an_8:22">8:22</span> Now it happened on one of those days,
that he entered into a boat, himself and his disciples, and he said to
them, "Let's go over to the other side of the lake." So they launched
out.

<span id="an_8:23">8:23</span> But as they sailed, he fell asleep. A
wind storm came down on the lake, and they were taking on dangerous
amounts of water.

<span id="an_8:24">8:24</span> They came to him, and awoke him, saying,
"Master, master, we are dying!" He awoke, and rebuked the wind and the
raging of the water, and they ceased, and it was calm.

<span id="an_8:25">8:25</span> He said to them, "Where is your faith?"
Being afraid they marveled, saying one to another, "Who is this, then,
that he commands even the winds and the water, and they obey him?"

<span id="an_8:26">8:26</span> They arrived at the country of the
Gadarenes, which is opposite Galilee.

<span id="an_8:27">8:27</span> When Jesus stepped ashore, a certain man
out of the city who had demons for a long time met him. He wore no
clothes, and didn't live in a house, but in the tombs.

<span id="an_8:28">8:28</span> When he saw Jesus, he cried out, and fell
down before him, and with a loud voice said, "What do I have to do with
you, Jesus, you Son of the Most High God? I beg you, don't torment me!"

<span id="an_8:29">8:29</span> For Jesus was commanding the unclean
spirit to come out of the man. For the unclean spirit had often seized
the man. He was kept under guard, and bound with chains and fetters.
Breaking the bands apart, he was driven by the demon into the desert.

<span id="an_8:30">8:30</span> Jesus asked him, "What is your name?" He
said, "Legion," for many demons had entered into him.

<span id="an_8:31">8:31</span> They begged him that he would not command
them to go into the abyss.

<span id="an_8:32">8:32</span> Now there was there a herd of many pigs
feeding on the mountain, and they begged him that he would allow them to
enter into those. He allowed them.

<span id="an_8:33">8:33</span> The demons came out from the man, and
entered into the pigs, and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the
lake, and were drowned.

<span id="an_8:34">8:34</span> When those who fed them saw what had
happened, they fled, and told it in the city and in the country.

<span id="an_8:35">8:35</span> People went out to see what had happened.
They came to Jesus, and found the man from whom the demons had gone out,
sitting at Jesus' feet, clothed and in his right mind; and they were
afraid.

<span id="an_8:36">8:36</span> Those who saw it told them how he who had
been possessed by demons was healed.

<span id="an_8:37">8:37</span> All the people of the surrounding country
of the Gadarenes asked him to depart from them, for they were very much
afraid. He entered into the boat, and returned.

<span id="an_8:38">8:38</span> But the man from whom the demons had gone
out begged him that he might go with him, but Jesus sent him away,
saying,

<span id="an_8:39">8:39</span> "Return to your house, and declare what
great things God has done for you." He went his way, proclaiming
throughout the whole city what great things Jesus had done for him.

<span id="an_8:40">8:40</span> It happened, when Jesus returned, that
the multitude welcomed him, for they were all waiting for him.

<span id="an_8:41">8:41</span> Behold, there came a man named Jairus,
and he was a ruler of the synagogue. He fell down at Jesus' feet, and
begged him to come into his house,

<span id="an_8:42">8:42</span> for he had an only daughter, about twelve
years of age, and she was dying. But as he went, the multitudes pressed
against him.

<span id="an_8:43">8:43</span> A woman who had a flow of blood for
twelve years, who had spent all her living on physicians, and could not
be healed by any,

<span id="an_8:44">8:44</span> came behind him, and touched the fringe
of his cloak, and immediately the flow of her blood stopped.

<span id="an_8:45">8:45</span> Jesus said, "Who touched me?" When all
denied it, Peter and those with him said, "Master, the multitudes press
and jostle you, and you say, 'Who touched me?'"

<span id="an_8:46">8:46</span> But Jesus said, "Someone did touch me,
for I perceived that power has gone out of me."

<span id="an_8:47">8:47</span> When the woman saw that she was not
hidden, she came trembling, and falling down before him declared to him
in the presence of all the people the reason why she had touched him,
and how she was healed immediately.

<span id="an_8:48">8:48</span> He said to her, "Daughter, cheer up. Your
faith has made you well. Go in peace."

<span id="an_8:49">8:49</span> While he still spoke, one from the ruler
of the synagogue's house came, saying to him, "Your daughter is dead.
Don't trouble the Teacher."

<span id="an_8:50">8:50</span> But Jesus hearing it, answered him,
"Don't be afraid. Only believe, and she will be healed."

<span id="an_8:51">8:51</span> When he came to the house, he didn't
allow anyone to enter in, except Peter, John, James, the father of the
child, and her mother.

<span id="an_8:52">8:52</span> All were weeping and mourning her, but he
said, "Don't weep. She isn't dead, but sleeping."

<span id="an_8:53">8:53</span> They were ridiculing him, knowing that
she was dead.

<span id="an_8:54">8:54</span> But he put them all outside, and taking
her by the hand, he called, saying, "Child, arise!"

<span id="an_8:55">8:55</span> Her spirit returned, and she rose up
immediately. He commanded that something be given to her to eat.

<span id="an_8:56">8:56</span> Her parents were amazed, but he commanded
them to tell no one what had been done.

<span id="an_9:1">9:1</span> He called the twelve together, and gave
them power and authority over all demons, and to cure diseases.

<span id="an_9:2">9:2</span> He sent them forth to preach the Kingdom of
God, and to heal the sick.

<span id="an_9:3">9:3</span> He said to them, "Take nothing for your
journey--neither staffs, nor wallet, nor bread, nor money; neither have
two coats apiece.

<span id="an_9:4">9:4</span> Into whatever house you enter, stay there,
and depart from there.

<span id="an_9:5">9:5</span> As many as don't receive you, when you
depart from that city, shake off even the dust from your feet for a
testimony against them."

<span id="an_9:6">9:6</span> They departed, and went throughout the
villages, preaching the Good News, and healing everywhere.

<span id="an_9:7">9:7</span> Now Herod the tetrarch heard of all that
was done by him; and he was very perplexed, because it was said by some
that John had risen from the dead,

<span id="an_9:8">9:8</span> and by some that Elijah had appeared, and
by others that one of the old prophets had risen again.

<span id="an_9:9">9:9</span> Herod said, "John I beheaded, but who is
this, about whom I hear such things?" He sought to see him.

<span id="an_9:10">9:10</span> The apostles, when they had returned,
told him what things they had done. He took them, and withdrew apart to
a deserted place of a city called Bethsaida.

<span id="an_9:11">9:11</span> But the multitudes, perceiving it,
followed him. He welcomed them, and spoke to them of the Kingdom of God,
and he cured those who needed healing.

<span id="an_9:12">9:12</span> The day began to wear away; and the
twelve came, and said to him, "Send the multitude away, that they may go
into the surrounding villages and farms, and lodge, and get food, for we
are here in a deserted place."

<span id="an_9:13">9:13</span> But he said to them, "You give them
something to eat." They said, "We have no more than five loaves and two
fish, unless we should go and buy food for all these people."

<span id="an_9:14">9:14</span> For they were about five thousand men. He
said to his disciples, "Make them sit down in groups of about fifty
each."

<span id="an_9:15">9:15</span> They did so, and made them all sit down.

<span id="an_9:16">9:16</span> He took the five loaves and the two fish,
and looking up to the sky, he blessed them, and broke them, and gave
them to the disciples to set before the multitude.

<span id="an_9:17">9:17</span> They ate, and were all filled. They
gathered up twelve baskets of broken pieces that were left over.

<span id="an_9:18">9:18</span> It happened, as he was praying alone,
that the disciples were with him, and he asked them, "Who do the
multitudes say that I am?"

<span id="an_9:19">9:19</span> They answered, "'John the Baptizer,' but
others say, 'Elijah,' and others, that one of the old prophets is risen
again."

<span id="an_9:20">9:20</span> He said to them, "But who do you say that
I am?" Peter answered, "The Christ of God."

<span id="an_9:21">9:21</span> But he warned them, and commanded them to
tell this to no one,

<span id="an_9:22">9:22</span> saying, "The Son of Man must suffer many
things, and be rejected by the elders, chief priests, and scribes, and
be killed, and the third day be raised up."

<span id="an_9:23">9:23</span> He said to all, "If anyone desires to
come after me, let him deny himself, take up his cross, and follow me.

<span id="an_9:24">9:24</span> For whoever desires to save his life will
lose it, but whoever will lose his life for my sake, the same will save
it.

<span id="an_9:25">9:25</span> For what does it profit a man if he gains
the whole world, and loses or forfeits his own self?

<span id="an_9:26">9:26</span> For whoever will be ashamed of me and of
my words, of him will the Son of Man be ashamed, when he comes in his
glory, and the glory of the Father, and of the holy angels.

<span id="an_9:27">9:27</span> But I tell you the truth: There are some
of those who stand here, who will in no way taste of death, until they
see the Kingdom of God."

<span id="an_9:28">9:28</span> It happened about eight days after these
sayings, that he took with him Peter, John, and James, and went up onto
the mountain to pray.

<span id="an_9:29">9:29</span> As he was praying, the appearance of his
face was altered, and his clothing became white and dazzling.

<span id="an_9:30">9:30</span> Behold, two men were talking with him,
who were Moses and Elijah,

<span id="an_9:31">9:31</span> who appeared in glory, and spoke of his
departure, which he was about to accomplish at Jerusalem.

<span id="an_9:32">9:32</span> Now Peter and those who were with him
were heavy with sleep, but when they were fully awake, they saw his
glory, and the two men who stood with him.

<span id="an_9:33">9:33</span> It happened, as they were parting from
him, that Peter said to Jesus, "Master, it is good for us to be here.
Let's make three tents: one for you, and one for Moses, and one for
Elijah," not knowing what he said.

<span id="an_9:34">9:34</span> While he said these things, a cloud came
and overshadowed them, and they were afraid as they entered into the
cloud.

<span id="an_9:35">9:35</span> A voice came out of the cloud, saying,
"This is my beloved Son. Listen to him!"

<span id="an_9:36">9:36</span> When the voice came, Jesus was found
alone. They were silent, and told no one in those days any of the things
which they had seen.

<span id="an_9:37">9:37</span> It happened on the next day, when they
had come down from the mountain, that a great multitude met him.

<span id="an_9:38">9:38</span> Behold, a man from the crowd called out,
saying, "Teacher, I beg you to look at my son, for he is my only child.

<span id="an_9:39">9:39</span> Behold, a spirit takes him, he suddenly
cries out, and it convulses him so that he foams, and it hardly departs
from him, bruising him severely.

<span id="an_9:40">9:40</span> I begged your disciples to cast it out,
and they couldn't."

<span id="an_9:41">9:41</span> Jesus answered, "Faithless and perverse
generation, how long shall I be with you and bear with you? Bring your
son here."

<span id="an_9:42">9:42</span> While he was still coming, the demon
threw him down and convulsed him violently. But Jesus rebuked the
unclean spirit, and healed the boy, and gave him back to his father.

<span id="an_9:43">9:43</span> They were all astonished at the majesty
of God. But while all were marveling at all the things which Jesus did,
he said to his disciples,

<span id="an_9:44">9:44</span> "Let these words sink into your ears, for
the Son of Man will be delivered up into the hands of men."

<span id="an_9:45">9:45</span> But they didn't understand this saying.
It was concealed from them, that they should not perceive it, and they
were afraid to ask him about this saying.

<span id="an_9:46">9:46</span> There arose an argument among them about
which of them was the greatest.

<span id="an_9:47">9:47</span> Jesus, perceiving the reasoning of their
hearts, took a little child, and set him by his side,

<span id="an_9:48">9:48</span> and said to them, "Whoever receives this
little child in my name receives me. Whoever receives me receives him
who sent me. For whoever is least among you all, this one will be
great."

<span id="an_9:49">9:49</span> John answered, "Master, we saw someone
casting out demons in your name, and we forbade him, because he doesn't
follow with us."

<span id="an_9:50">9:50</span> Jesus said to him, "Don't forbid him, for
he who is not against us is for us."

<span id="an_9:51">9:51</span> It came to pass, when the days were near
that he should be taken up, he intently set his face to go to Jerusalem,

<span id="an_9:52">9:52</span> and sent messengers before his face. They
went, and entered into a village of the Samaritans, so as to prepare for
him.

<span id="an_9:53">9:53</span> They didn't receive him, because he was
traveling with his face set towards Jerusalem.

<span id="an_9:54">9:54</span> When his disciples, James and John, saw
this, they said, "Lord, do you want us to command fire to come down from
the sky, and destroy them, just as Elijah did?"

<span id="an_9:55">9:55</span> But he turned and rebuked them, "You
don't know of what kind of spirit you are.

<span id="an_9:56">9:56</span> For the Son of Man didn't come to destroy
men's lives, but to save them." They went to another village.

<span id="an_9:57">9:57</span> As they went on the way, a certain man
said to him, "I want to follow you wherever you go, Lord."

<span id="an_9:58">9:58</span> Jesus said to him, "The foxes have holes,
and the birds of the sky have nests, but the Son of Man has no place to
lay his head."

<span id="an_9:59">9:59</span> He said to another, "Follow me!" But he
said, "Lord, allow me first to go and bury my father."

<span id="an_9:60">9:60</span> But Jesus said to him, "Leave the dead to
bury their own dead, but you go and announce the Kingdom of God."

<span id="an_9:61">9:61</span> Another also said, "I want to follow you,
Lord, but first allow me to say good-bye to those who are at my house."

<span id="an_9:62">9:62</span> But Jesus said to him, "No one, having
put his hand to the plow, and looking back, is fit for the Kingdom of
God."

<span id="an_10:1">10:1</span> Now after these things, the Lord also
appointed seventy others, and sent them two by two ahead of him into
every city and place, where he was about to come.

<span id="an_10:2">10:2</span> Then he said to them, "The harvest is
indeed plentiful, but the laborers are few. Pray therefore to the Lord
of the harvest, that he may send out laborers into his harvest.

<span id="an_10:3">10:3</span> Go your ways. Behold, I send you out as
lambs among wolves.

<span id="an_10:4">10:4</span> Carry no purse, nor wallet, nor sandals.
Greet no one on the way.

<span id="an_10:5">10:5</span> Into whatever house you enter, first say,
'Peace be to this house.'

<span id="an_10:6">10:6</span> If a son of peace is there, your peace
will rest on him; but if not, it will return to you.

<span id="an_10:7">10:7</span> Remain in that same house, eating and
drinking the things they give, for the laborer is worthy of his wages.
Don't go from house to house.

<span id="an_10:8">10:8</span> Into whatever city you enter, and they
receive you, eat the things that are set before you.

<span id="an_10:9">10:9</span> Heal the sick who are therein, and tell
them, 'The Kingdom of God has come near to you.'

<span id="an_10:10">10:10</span> But into whatever city you enter, and
they don't receive you, go out into its streets and say,

<span id="an_10:11">10:11</span> 'Even the dust from your city that
clings to us, we wipe off against you. Nevertheless know this, that the
Kingdom of God has come near to you.'

<span id="an_10:12">10:12</span> I tell you, it will be more tolerable
in that day for Sodom than for that city.

<span id="an_10:13">10:13</span> "Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you,
Bethsaida! For if the mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon which
were done in you, they would have repented long ago, sitting in
sackcloth and ashes.

<span id="an_10:14">10:14</span> But it will be more tolerable for Tyre
and Sidon in the judgment than for you.

<span id="an_10:15">10:15</span> You, Capernaum, who are exalted to
heaven, will be brought down to Hades.

<span id="an_10:16">10:16</span> Whoever listens to you listens to me,
and whoever rejects you rejects me. Whoever rejects me rejects him who
sent me."

<span id="an_10:17">10:17</span> The seventy returned with joy, saying,
"Lord, even the demons are subject to us in your name!"

<span id="an_10:18">10:18</span> He said to them, "I saw Satan having
fallen like lightning from heaven.

<span id="an_10:19">10:19</span> Behold, I give you authority to tread
on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy. Nothing
will in any way hurt you.

<span id="an_10:20">10:20</span> Nevertheless, don't rejoice in this,
that the spirits are subject to you, but rejoice that your names are
written in heaven."

<span id="an_10:21">10:21</span> In that same hour Jesus rejoiced in the
Holy Spirit, and said, "I thank you, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth,
that you have hidden these things from the wise and understanding, and
revealed them to little children. Yes, Father, for so it was
well-pleasing in your sight."

<span id="an_10:22">10:22</span> Turning to the disciples, he said, "All
things have been delivered to me by my Father. No one knows who the Son
is, except the Father, and who the Father is, except the Son, and he to
whomever the Son desires to reveal him."

<span id="an_10:23">10:23</span> Turning to the disciples, he said
privately, "Blessed are the eyes which see the things that you see,

<span id="an_10:24">10:24</span> for I tell you that many prophets and
kings desired to see the things which you see, and didn't see them, and
to hear the things which you hear, and didn't hear them."

<span id="an_10:25">10:25</span> Behold, a certain lawyer stood up and
tested him, saying, "Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?"

<span id="an_10:26">10:26</span> He said to him, "What is written in the
law? How do you read it?"

<span id="an_10:27">10:27</span> He answered, "You shall love the Lord
your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your
strength, and with all your mind; and your neighbor as yourself."

<span id="an_10:28">10:28</span> He said to him, "You have answered
correctly. Do this, and you will live."

<span id="an_10:29">10:29</span> But he, desiring to justify himself,
asked Jesus, "Who is my neighbor?"

<span id="an_10:30">10:30</span> Jesus answered, "A certain man was
going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and he fell among robbers, who
both stripped him and beat him, and departed, leaving him half dead.

<span id="an_10:31">10:31</span> By chance a certain priest was going
down that way. When he saw him, he passed by on the other side.

<span id="an_10:32">10:32</span> In the same way a Levite also, when he
came to the place, and saw him, passed by on the other side.

<span id="an_10:33">10:33</span> But a certain Samaritan, as he
traveled, came where he was. When he saw him, he was moved with
compassion,

<span id="an_10:34">10:34</span> came to him, and bound up his wounds,
pouring on oil and wine. He set him on his own animal, and brought him
to an inn, and took care of him.

<span id="an_10:35">10:35</span> On the next day, when he departed, he
took out two denarii, and gave them to the host, and said to him, 'Take
care of him. Whatever you spend beyond that, I will repay you when I
return.'

<span id="an_10:36">10:36</span> Now which of these three do you think
seemed to be a neighbor to him who fell among the robbers?"

<span id="an_10:37">10:37</span> He said, "He who showed mercy on him."
Then Jesus said to him, "Go and do likewise."

<span id="an_10:38">10:38</span> It happened as they went on their way,
he entered into a certain village, and a certain woman named Martha
received him into her house.

<span id="an_10:39">10:39</span> She had a sister called Mary, who also
sat at Jesus' feet, and heard his word.

<span id="an_10:40">10:40</span> But Martha was distracted with much
serving, and she came up to him, and said, "Lord, don't you care that my
sister left me to serve alone? Ask her therefore to help me."

<span id="an_10:41">10:41</span> Jesus answered her, "Martha, Martha,
you are anxious and troubled about many things,

<span id="an_10:42">10:42</span> but one thing is needed. Mary has
chosen the good part, which will not be taken away from her."

<span id="an_11:1">11:1</span> It happened, that when he finished
praying in a certain place, one of his disciples said to him, "Lord,
teach us to pray, just as John also taught his disciples."

<span id="an_11:2">11:2</span> He said to them, "When you pray, say,
'Our Father in heaven, may your name be kept holy. May your Kingdom
come. May your will be done on Earth, as it is in heaven.

<span id="an_11:3">11:3</span> Give us day by day our daily bread.

<span id="an_11:4">11:4</span> Forgive us our sins, for we ourselves
also forgive everyone who is indebted to us. Bring us not into
temptation, but deliver us from the evil one.'"

<span id="an_11:5">11:5</span> He said to them, "Which of you, if you go
to a friend at midnight, and tell him, 'Friend, lend me three loaves of
bread,

<span id="an_11:6">11:6</span> for a friend of mine has come to me from
a journey, and I have nothing to set before him,'

<span id="an_11:7">11:7</span> and he from within will answer and say,
'Don't bother me. The door is now shut, and my children are with me in
bed. I can't get up and give it to you'?

<span id="an_11:8">11:8</span> I tell you, although he will not rise and
give it to him because he is his friend, yet because of his persistence,
he will get up and give him as many as he needs.

<span id="an_11:9">11:9</span> "I tell you, keep asking, and it will be
given you. Keep seeking, and you will find. Keep knocking, and it will
be opened to you.

<span id="an_11:10">11:10</span> For everyone who asks receives. He who
seeks finds. To him who knocks it will be opened.

<span id="an_11:11">11:11</span> "Which of you fathers, if your son asks
for bread, will give him a stone? Or if he asks for a fish, he won't
give him a snake instead of a fish, will he?

<span id="an_11:12">11:12</span> Or if he asks for an egg, he won't give
him a scorpion, will he?

<span id="an_11:13">11:13</span> If you then, being evil, know how to
give good gifts to your children, how much more will your heavenly
Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him?"

<span id="an_11:14">11:14</span> He was casting out a demon, and it was
mute. It happened, when the demon had gone out, the mute man spoke; and
the multitudes marveled.

<span id="an_11:15">11:15</span> But some of them said, "He casts out
demons by Beelzebul, the prince of the demons."

<span id="an_11:16">11:16</span> Others, testing him, sought from him a
sign from heaven.

<span id="an_11:17">11:17</span> But he, knowing their thoughts, said to
them, "Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation. A
house divided against itself falls.

<span id="an_11:18">11:18</span> If Satan also is divided against
himself, how will his kingdom stand? For you say that I cast out demons
by Beelzebul.

<span id="an_11:19">11:19</span> But if I cast out demons by Beelzebul,
by whom do your children cast them out? Therefore will they be your
judges.

<span id="an_11:20">11:20</span> But if I by the finger of God cast out
demons, then the Kingdom of God has come to you.

<span id="an_11:21">11:21</span> "When the strong man, fully armed,
guards his own dwelling, his goods are safe.

<span id="an_11:22">11:22</span> But when someone stronger attacks him
and overcomes him, he takes from him his whole armor in which he
trusted, and divides his spoils.

<span id="an_11:23">11:23</span> "He that is not with me is against me.
He who doesn't gather with me scatters.

<span id="an_11:24">11:24</span> The unclean spirit, when he has gone
out of the man, passes through dry places, seeking rest, and finding
none, he says, 'I will turn back to my house from which I came out.'

<span id="an_11:25">11:25</span> When he returns, he finds it swept and
put in order.

<span id="an_11:26">11:26</span> Then he goes, and takes seven other
spirits more evil than himself, and they enter in and dwell there. The
last state of that man becomes worse than the first."

<span id="an_11:27">11:27</span> It came to pass, as he said these
things, a certain woman out of the multitude lifted up her voice, and
said to him, "Blessed is the womb that bore you, and the breasts which
nursed you!"

<span id="an_11:28">11:28</span> But he said, "On the contrary, blessed
are those who hear the word of God, and keep it."

<span id="an_11:29">11:29</span> When the multitudes were gathering
together to him, he began to say, "This is an evil generation. It seeks
after a sign. No sign will be given to it but the sign of Jonah, the
prophet.

<span id="an_11:30">11:30</span> For even as Jonah became a sign to the
Ninevites, so will also the Son of Man be to this generation.

<span id="an_11:31">11:31</span> The Queen of the South will rise up in
the judgment with the men of this generation, and will condemn them: for
she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and
behold, one greater than Solomon is here.

<span id="an_11:32">11:32</span> The men of Nineveh will stand up in the
judgment with this generation, and will condemn it: for they repented at
the preaching of Jonah, and behold, one greater than Jonah is here.

<span id="an_11:33">11:33</span> "No one, when he has lit a lamp, puts
it in a cellar or under a basket, but on a stand, that those who come in
may see the light.

<span id="an_11:34">11:34</span> The lamp of the body is the eye.
Therefore when your eye is good, your whole body is also full of light;
but when it is evil, your body also is full of darkness.

<span id="an_11:35">11:35</span> Therefore see whether the light that is
in you isn't darkness.

<span id="an_11:36">11:36</span> If therefore your whole body is full of
light, having no part dark, it will be wholly full of light, as when the
lamp with its bright shining gives you light."

<span id="an_11:37">11:37</span> Now as he spoke, a certain Pharisee
asked him to dine with him. He went in, and sat at the table.

<span id="an_11:38">11:38</span> When the Pharisee saw it, he marveled
that he had not first washed himself before dinner.

<span id="an_11:39">11:39</span> The Lord said to him, "Now you
Pharisees cleanse the outside of the cup and of the platter, but your
inward part is full of extortion and wickedness.

<span id="an_11:40">11:40</span> You foolish ones, didn't he who made
the outside make the inside also?

<span id="an_11:41">11:41</span> But give for gifts to the needy those
things which are within, and behold, all things will be clean to you.

<span id="an_11:42">11:42</span> But woe to you Pharisees! For you tithe
mint and rue and every herb, but you bypass justice and the love of God.
You ought to have done these, and not to have left the other undone.

<span id="an_11:43">11:43</span> Woe to you Pharisees! For you love the
best seats in the synagogues, and the greetings in the marketplaces.

<span id="an_11:44">11:44</span> Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees,
hypocrites! For you are like hidden graves, and the men who walk over
them don't know it."

<span id="an_11:45">11:45</span> One of the lawyers answered him,
"Teacher, in saying this you insult us also."

<span id="an_11:46">11:46</span> He said, "Woe to you lawyers also! For
you load men with burdens that are difficult to carry, and you
yourselves won't even lift one finger to help carry those burdens.

<span id="an_11:47">11:47</span> Woe to you! For you build the tombs of
the prophets, and your fathers killed them.

<span id="an_11:48">11:48</span> So you testify and consent to the works
of your fathers. For they killed them, and you build their tombs.

<span id="an_11:49">11:49</span> Therefore also the wisdom of God said,
'I will send to them prophets and apostles; and some of them they will
kill and persecute,

<span id="an_11:50">11:50</span> that the blood of all the prophets,
which was shed from the foundation of the world, may be required of this
generation;

<span id="an_11:51">11:51</span> from the blood of Abel to the blood of
Zachariah, who perished between the altar and the sanctuary.' Yes, I
tell you, it will be required of this generation.

<span id="an_11:52">11:52</span> Woe to you lawyers! For you took away
the key of knowledge. You didn't enter in yourselves, and those who were
entering in, you hindered."

<span id="an_11:53">11:53</span> As he said these things to them, the
scribes and the Pharisees began to be terribly angry, and to draw many
things out of him;

<span id="an_11:54">11:54</span> lying in wait for him, and seeking to
catch him in something he might say, that they might accuse him.

<span id="an_12:1">12:1</span> Meanwhile, when a multitude of many
thousands had gathered together, so much so that they trampled on each
other, he began to tell his disciples first of all, "Beware of the yeast
of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy.

<span id="an_12:2">12:2</span> But there is nothing covered up, that
will not be revealed, nor hidden, that will not be known.

<span id="an_12:3">12:3</span> Therefore whatever you have said in the
darkness will be heard in the light. What you have spoken in the ear in
the inner rooms will be proclaimed on the housetops.

<span id="an_12:4">12:4</span> "I tell you, my friends, don't be afraid
of those who kill the body, and after that have no more that they can
do.

<span id="an_12:5">12:5</span> But I will warn you whom you should fear.
Fear him, who after he has killed, has power to cast into Gehenna. Yes,
I tell you, fear him.

<span id="an_12:6">12:6</span> "Aren't five sparrows sold for two
assaria coins? Not one of them is forgotten by God.

<span id="an_12:7">12:7</span> But the very hairs of your head are all
numbered. Therefore don't be afraid. You are of more value than many
sparrows.

<span id="an_12:8">12:8</span> "I tell you, everyone who confesses me
before men, him will the Son of Man also confess before the angels of
God;

<span id="an_12:9">12:9</span> but he who denies me in the presence of
men will be denied in the presence of the angels of God.

<span id="an_12:10">12:10</span> Everyone who speaks a word against the
Son of Man will be forgiven, but those who blaspheme against the Holy
Spirit will not be forgiven.

<span id="an_12:11">12:11</span> When they bring you before the
synagogues, the rulers, and the authorities, don't be anxious how or
what you will answer, or what you will say;

<span id="an_12:12">12:12</span> for the Holy Spirit will teach you in
that same hour what you must say."

<span id="an_12:13">12:13</span> One of the multitude said to him,
"Teacher, tell my brother to divide the inheritance with me."

<span id="an_12:14">12:14</span> But he said to him, "Man, who made me a
judge or an arbitrator over you?"

<span id="an_12:15">12:15</span> He said to them, "Beware! Keep
yourselves from covetousness, for a man's life doesn't consist of the
abundance of the things which he possesses."

<span id="an_12:16">12:16</span> He spoke a parable to them, saying,
"The ground of a certain rich man brought forth abundantly.

<span id="an_12:17">12:17</span> He reasoned within himself, saying,
'What will I do, because I don't have room to store my crops?'

<span id="an_12:18">12:18</span> He said, 'This is what I will do. I
will pull down my barns, and build bigger ones, and there I will store
all my grain and my goods.

<span id="an_12:19">12:19</span> I will tell my soul, "Soul, you have
many goods laid up for many years. Take your ease, eat, drink, be
merry."'

<span id="an_12:20">12:20</span> "But God said to him, 'You foolish one,
tonight your soul is required of you. The things which you have
prepared--whose will they be?'

<span id="an_12:21">12:21</span> So is he who lays up treasure for
himself, and is not rich toward God."

<span id="an_12:22">12:22</span> He said to his disciples, "Therefore I
tell you, don't be anxious for your life, what you will eat, nor yet for
your body, what you will wear.

<span id="an_12:23">12:23</span> Life is more than food, and the body is
more than clothing.

<span id="an_12:24">12:24</span> Consider the ravens: they don't sow,
they don't reap, they have no warehouse or barn, and God feeds them. How
much more valuable are you than birds!

<span id="an_12:25">12:25</span> Which of you by being anxious can add a
cubit to his height?

<span id="an_12:26">12:26</span> If then you aren't able to do even the
least things, why are you anxious about the rest?

<span id="an_12:27">12:27</span> Consider the lilies, how they grow.
They don't toil, neither do they spin; yet I tell you, even Solomon in
all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.

<span id="an_12:28">12:28</span> But if this is how God clothes the
grass in the field, which today exists, and tomorrow is cast into the
oven, how much more will he clothe you, O you of little faith?

<span id="an_12:29">12:29</span> Don't seek what you will eat or what
you will drink; neither be anxious.

<span id="an_12:30">12:30</span> For the nations of the world seek after
all of these things, but your Father knows that you need these things.

<span id="an_12:31">12:31</span> But seek God's Kingdom, and all these
things will be added to you.

<span id="an_12:32">12:32</span> Don't be afraid, little flock, for it
is your Father's good pleasure to give you the Kingdom.

<span id="an_12:33">12:33</span> Sell that which you have, and give
gifts to the needy. Make for yourselves purses which don't grow old, a
treasure in the heavens that doesn't fail, where no thief approaches,
neither moth destroys.

<span id="an_12:34">12:34</span> For where your treasure is, there will
your heart be also.

<span id="an_12:35">12:35</span> "Let your waist be dressed and your
lamps burning.

<span id="an_12:36">12:36</span> Be like men watching for their lord,
when he returns from the marriage feast; that, when he comes and knocks,
they may immediately open to him.

<span id="an_12:37">12:37</span> Blessed are those servants, whom the
lord will find watching when he comes. Most certainly I tell you, that
he will dress himself, and make them recline, and will come and serve
them.

<span id="an_12:38">12:38</span> They will be blessed if he comes in the
second or third watch, and finds them so.

<span id="an_12:39">12:39</span> But know this, that if the master of
the house had known in what hour the thief was coming, he would have
watched, and not allowed his house to be broken into.

<span id="an_12:40">12:40</span> Therefore be ready also, for the Son of
Man is coming in an hour that you don't expect him."

<span id="an_12:41">12:41</span> Peter said to him, "Lord, are you
telling this parable to us, or to everybody?"

<span id="an_12:42">12:42</span> The Lord said, "Who then is the
faithful and wise steward, whom his lord will set over his household, to
give them their portion of food at the right times?

<span id="an_12:43">12:43</span> Blessed is that servant whom his lord
will find doing so when he comes.

<span id="an_12:44">12:44</span> Truly I tell you, that he will set him
over all that he has.

<span id="an_12:45">12:45</span> But if that servant says in his heart,
'My lord delays his coming,' and begins to beat the menservants and the
maidservants, and to eat and drink, and to be drunken,

<span id="an_12:46">12:46</span> then the lord of that servant will come
in a day when he isn't expecting him, and in an hour that he doesn't
know, and will cut him in two, and place his portion with the
unfaithful.

<span id="an_12:47">12:47</span> That servant, who knew his lord's will,
and didn't prepare, nor do what he wanted, will be beaten with many
stripes,

<span id="an_12:48">12:48</span> but he who didn't know, and did things
worthy of stripes, will be beaten with few stripes. To whoever much is
given, of him will much be required; and to whom much was entrusted, of
him more will be asked.

<span id="an_12:49">12:49</span> "I came to throw fire on the earth. I
wish it were already kindled.

<span id="an_12:50">12:50</span> But I have a baptism to be baptized
with, and how distressed I am until it is accomplished!

<span id="an_12:51">12:51</span> Do you think that I have come to give
peace in the earth? I tell you, no, but rather division.

<span id="an_12:52">12:52</span> For from now on, there will be five in
one house divided, three against two, and two against three.

<span id="an_12:53">12:53</span> They will be divided, father against
son, and son against father; mother against daughter, and daughter
against her mother; mother-in-law against her daughter-in-law, and
daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law."

<span id="an_12:54">12:54</span> He said to the multitudes also, "When
you see a cloud rising from the west, immediately you say, 'A shower is
coming,' and so it happens.

<span id="an_12:55">12:55</span> When a south wind blows, you say,
'There will be a scorching heat,' and it happens.

<span id="an_12:56">12:56</span> You hypocrites! You know how to
interpret the appearance of the earth and the sky, but how is it that
you don't interpret this time?

<span id="an_12:57">12:57</span> Why don't you judge for yourselves what
is right?

<span id="an_12:58">12:58</span> For when you are going with your
adversary before the magistrate, try diligently on the way to be
released from him, lest perhaps he drag you to the judge, and the judge
deliver you to the officer, and the officer throw you into prison.

<span id="an_12:59">12:59</span> I tell you, you will by no means get
out of there, until you have paid the very last penny."

<span id="an_13:1">13:1</span> Now there were some present at the same
time who told him about the Galileans, whose blood Pilate had mixed with
their sacrifices.

<span id="an_13:2">13:2</span> Jesus answered them, "Do you think that
these Galileans were worse sinners than all the other Galileans, because
they suffered such things?

<span id="an_13:3">13:3</span> I tell you, no, but unless you repent,
you will all perish in the same way.

<span id="an_13:4">13:4</span> Or those eighteen, on whom the tower in
Siloam fell, and killed them; do you think that they were worse
offenders than all the men who dwell in Jerusalem?

<span id="an_13:5">13:5</span> I tell you, no, but, unless you repent,
you will all perish in the same way."

<span id="an_13:6">13:6</span> He spoke this parable. "A certain man had
a fig tree planted in his vineyard, and he came seeking fruit on it, and
found none.

<span id="an_13:7">13:7</span> He said to the vine dresser, 'Behold,
these three years I have come looking for fruit on this fig tree, and
found none. Cut it down. Why does it waste the soil?'

<span id="an_13:8">13:8</span> He answered, 'Lord, leave it alone this
year also, until I dig around it, and fertilize it.

<span id="an_13:9">13:9</span> If it bears fruit, fine; but if not,
after that, you can cut it down.'"

<span id="an_13:10">13:10</span> He was teaching in one of the
synagogues on the Sabbath day.

<span id="an_13:11">13:11</span> Behold, there was a woman who had a
spirit of infirmity eighteen years, and she was bent over, and could in
no way straighten herself up.

<span id="an_13:12">13:12</span> When Jesus saw her, he called her, and
said to her, "Woman, you are freed from your infirmity."

<span id="an_13:13">13:13</span> He laid his hands on her, and
immediately she stood up straight, and glorified God.

<span id="an_13:14">13:14</span> The ruler of the synagogue, being
indignant because Jesus had healed on the Sabbath, said to the
multitude, "There are six days in which men ought to work. Therefore
come on those days and be healed, and not on the Sabbath day!"

<span id="an_13:15">13:15</span> Therefore the Lord answered him, "You
hypocrites! Doesn't each one of you free his ox or his donkey from the
stall on the Sabbath, and lead him away to water?

<span id="an_13:16">13:16</span> Ought not this woman, being a daughter
of Abraham, whom Satan had bound eighteen long years, be freed from this
bondage on the Sabbath day?"

<span id="an_13:17">13:17</span> As he said these things, all his
adversaries were disappointed, and all the multitude rejoiced for all
the glorious things that were done by him.

<span id="an_13:18">13:18</span> He said, "What is the Kingdom of God
like? To what shall I compare it?

<span id="an_13:19">13:19</span> It is like a grain of mustard seed,
which a man took, and put in his own garden. It grew, and became a large
tree, and the birds of the sky lodged in its branches."

<span id="an_13:20">13:20</span> Again he said, "To what shall I compare
the Kingdom of God?

<span id="an_13:21">13:21</span> It is like yeast, which a woman took
and hid in three measures of flour, until it was all leavened."

<span id="an_13:22">13:22</span> He went on his way through cities and
villages, teaching, and traveling on to Jerusalem.

<span id="an_13:23">13:23</span> One said to him, "Lord, are they few
who are saved?" He said to them,

<span id="an_13:24">13:24</span> "Strive to enter in by the narrow door,
for many, I tell you, will seek to enter in, and will not be able.

<span id="an_13:25">13:25</span> When once the master of the house has
risen up, and has shut the door, and you begin to stand outside, and to
knock at the door, saying, 'Lord, Lord, open to us!' then he will answer
and tell you, 'I don't know you or where you come from.'

<span id="an_13:26">13:26</span> Then you will begin to say, 'We ate and
drank in your presence, and you taught in our streets.'

<span id="an_13:27">13:27</span> He will say, 'I tell you, I don't know
where you come from. Depart from me, all you workers of iniquity.'

<span id="an_13:28">13:28</span> There will be weeping and gnashing of
teeth, when you see Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and all the prophets, in the
Kingdom of God, and yourselves being thrown outside.

<span id="an_13:29">13:29</span> They will come from the east, west,
north, and south, and will sit down in the Kingdom of God.

<span id="an_13:30">13:30</span> Behold, there are some who are last who
will be first, and there are some who are first who will be last."

<span id="an_13:31">13:31</span> On that same day, some Pharisees came,
saying to him, "Get out of here, and go away, for Herod wants to kill
you."

<span id="an_13:32">13:32</span> He said to them, "Go and tell that fox,
'Behold, I cast out demons and perform cures today and tomorrow, and the
third day I complete my mission.

<span id="an_13:33">13:33</span> Nevertheless I must go on my way today
and tomorrow and the next day, for it can't be that a prophet perish
outside of Jerusalem.'

<span id="an_13:34">13:34</span> "Jerusalem, Jerusalem, that kills the
prophets, and stones those who are sent to her! How often I wanted to
gather your children together, like a hen gathers her own brood under
her wings, and you refused!

<span id="an_13:35">13:35</span> Behold, your house is left to you
desolate. I tell you, you will not see me, until you say, 'Blessed is he
who comes in the name of the Lord!'"

<span id="an_14:1">14:1</span> It happened, when he went into the house
of one of the rulers of the Pharisees on a Sabbath to eat bread, that
they were watching him.

<span id="an_14:2">14:2</span> Behold, a certain man who had dropsy was
in front of him.

<span id="an_14:3">14:3</span> Jesus, answering, spoke to the lawyers
and Pharisees, saying, "Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?"

<span id="an_14:4">14:4</span> But they were silent. He took him, and
healed him, and let him go.

<span id="an_14:5">14:5</span> He answered them, "Which of you, if your
son or an ox fell into a well, wouldn't immediately pull him out on a
Sabbath day?"

<span id="an_14:6">14:6</span> They couldn't answer him regarding these
things.

<span id="an_14:7">14:7</span> He spoke a parable to those who were
invited, when he noticed how they chose the best seats, and said to
them,

<span id="an_14:8">14:8</span> "When you are invited by anyone to a
marriage feast, don't sit in the best seat, since perhaps someone more
honorable than you might be invited by him,

<span id="an_14:9">14:9</span> and he who invited both of you would come
and tell you, 'Make room for this person.' Then you would begin, with
shame, to take the lowest place.

<span id="an_14:10">14:10</span> But when you are invited, go and sit in
the lowest place, so that when he who invited you comes, he may tell
you, 'Friend, move up higher.' Then you will be honored in the presence
of all who sit at the table with you.

<span id="an_14:11">14:11</span> For everyone who exalts himself will be
humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted."

<span id="an_14:12">14:12</span> He also said to the one who had invited
him, "When you make a dinner or a supper, don't call your friends, nor
your brothers, nor your kinsmen, nor rich neighbors, or perhaps they
might also return the favor, and pay you back.

<span id="an_14:13">14:13</span> But when you make a feast, ask the
poor, the maimed, the lame, or the blind;

<span id="an_14:14">14:14</span> and you will be blessed, because they
don't have the resources to repay you. For you will be repaid in the
resurrection of the righteous."

<span id="an_14:15">14:15</span> When one of those who sat at the table
with him heard these things, he said to him, "Blessed is he who will
feast in the Kingdom of God!"

<span id="an_14:16">14:16</span> But he said to him, "A certain man made
a great supper, and he invited many people.

<span id="an_14:17">14:17</span> He sent out his servant at supper time
to tell those who were invited, 'Come, for everything is ready now.'

<span id="an_14:18">14:18</span> They all as one began to make excuses.
"The first said to him, 'I have bought a field, and I must go and see
it. Please have me excused.'

<span id="an_14:19">14:19</span> "Another said, 'I have bought five yoke
of oxen, and I must go try them out. Please have me excused.'

<span id="an_14:20">14:20</span> "Another said, 'I have married a wife,
and therefore I can't come.'

<span id="an_14:21">14:21</span> "That servant came, and told his lord
these things. Then the master of the house, being angry, said to his
servant, 'Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city, and
bring in the poor, maimed, blind, and lame.'

<span id="an_14:22">14:22</span> "The servant said, 'Lord, it is done as
you commanded, and there is still room.'

<span id="an_14:23">14:23</span> "The lord said to the servant, 'Go out
into the highways and hedges, and compel them to come in, that my house
may be filled.

<span id="an_14:24">14:24</span> For I tell you that none of those men
who were invited will taste of my supper.'"

<span id="an_14:25">14:25</span> Now great multitudes were going with
him. He turned and said to them,

<span id="an_14:26">14:26</span> "If anyone comes to me, and doesn't
disregard his own father, mother, wife, children, brothers, and sisters,
yes, and his own life also, he can't be my disciple.

<span id="an_14:27">14:27</span> Whoever doesn't bear his own cross, and
come after me, can't be my disciple.

<span id="an_14:28">14:28</span> For which of you, desiring to build a
tower, doesn't first sit down and count the cost, to see if he has
enough to complete it?

<span id="an_14:29">14:29</span> Or perhaps, when he has laid a
foundation, and is not able to finish, everyone who sees begins to mock
him,

<span id="an_14:30">14:30</span> saying, 'This man began to build, and
wasn't able to finish.'

<span id="an_14:31">14:31</span> Or what king, as he goes to encounter
another king in war, will not sit down first and consider whether he is
able with ten thousand to meet him who comes against him with twenty
thousand?

<span id="an_14:32">14:32</span> Or else, while the other is yet a great
way off, he sends an envoy, and asks for conditions of peace.

<span id="an_14:33">14:33</span> So therefore whoever of you who doesn't
renounce all that he has, he can't be my disciple.

<span id="an_14:34">14:34</span> Salt is good, but if the salt becomes
flat and tasteless, with what do you season it?

<span id="an_14:35">14:35</span> It is fit neither for the soil nor for
the manure pile. It is thrown out. He who has ears to hear, let him
hear."

<span id="an_15:1">15:1</span> Now all the tax collectors and sinners
were coming close to him to hear him.

<span id="an_15:2">15:2</span> The Pharisees and the scribes murmured,
saying, "This man welcomes sinners, and eats with them."

<span id="an_15:3">15:3</span> He told them this parable.

<span id="an_15:4">15:4</span> "Which of you men, if you had one hundred
sheep, and lost one of them, wouldn't leave the ninety-nine in the
wilderness, and go after the one that was lost, until he found it?

<span id="an_15:5">15:5</span> When he has found it, he carries it on
his shoulders, rejoicing.

<span id="an_15:6">15:6</span> When he comes home, he calls together his
friends and his neighbors, saying to them, 'Rejoice with me, for I have
found my sheep which was lost!'

<span id="an_15:7">15:7</span> I tell you that even so there will be
more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents, than over ninety-nine
righteous people who need no repentance.

<span id="an_15:8">15:8</span> Or what woman, if she had ten drachma
coins, if she lost one drachma coin, wouldn't light a lamp, sweep the
house, and seek diligently until she found it?

<span id="an_15:9">15:9</span> When she has found it, she calls together
her friends and neighbors, saying, 'Rejoice with me, for I have found
the drachma which I had lost.'

<span id="an_15:10">15:10</span> Even so, I tell you, there is joy in
the presence of the angels of God over one sinner repenting."

<span id="an_15:11">15:11</span> He said, "A certain man had two sons.

<span id="an_15:12">15:12</span> The younger of them said to his father,
'Father, give me my share of your property.' He divided his livelihood
between them.

<span id="an_15:13">15:13</span> Not many days after, the younger son
gathered all of this together and traveled into a far country. There he
wasted his property with riotous living.

<span id="an_15:14">15:14</span> When he had spent all of it, there
arose a severe famine in that country, and he began to be in need.

<span id="an_15:15">15:15</span> He went and joined himself to one of
the citizens of that country, and he sent him into his fields to feed
pigs.

<span id="an_15:16">15:16</span> He wanted to fill his belly with the
husks that the pigs ate, but no one gave him any.

<span id="an_15:17">15:17</span> But when he came to himself he said,
'How many hired servants of my father's have bread enough to spare, and
I'm dying with hunger!

<span id="an_15:18">15:18</span> I will get up and go to my father, and
will tell him, "Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in your sight.

<span id="an_15:19">15:19</span> I am no more worthy to be called your
son. Make me as one of your hired servants."'

<span id="an_15:20">15:20</span> "He arose, and came to his father. But
while he was still far off, his father saw him, and was moved with
compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him.

<span id="an_15:21">15:21</span> The son said to him, 'Father, I have
sinned against heaven, and in your sight. I am no longer worthy to be
called your son.'

<span id="an_15:22">15:22</span> "But the father said to his servants,
'Bring out the best robe, and put it on him. Put a ring on his hand, and
shoes on his feet.

<span id="an_15:23">15:23</span> Bring the fattened calf, kill it, and
let us eat, and celebrate;

<span id="an_15:24">15:24</span> for this, my son, was dead, and is
alive again. He was lost, and is found.' They began to celebrate.

<span id="an_15:25">15:25</span> "Now his elder son was in the field. As
he came near to the house, he heard music and dancing.

<span id="an_15:26">15:26</span> He called one of the servants to him,
and asked what was going on.

<span id="an_15:27">15:27</span> He said to him, 'Your brother has come,
and your father has killed the fattened calf, because he has received
him back safe and healthy.'

<span id="an_15:28">15:28</span> But he was angry, and would not go in.
Therefore his father came out, and begged him.

<span id="an_15:29">15:29</span> But he answered his father, 'Behold,
these many years I have served you, and I never disobeyed a commandment
of yours, but you never gave me a goat, that I might celebrate with my
friends.

<span id="an_15:30">15:30</span> But when this, your son, came, who has
devoured your living with prostitutes, you killed the fattened calf for
him.'

<span id="an_15:31">15:31</span> "He said to him, 'Son, you are always
with me, and all that is mine is yours.

<span id="an_15:32">15:32</span> But it was appropriate to celebrate and
be glad, for this, your brother, was dead, and is alive again. He was
lost, and is found.'"

<span id="an_16:1">16:1</span> He also said to his disciples, "There was
a certain rich man who had a manager. An accusation was made to him that
this man was wasting his possessions.

<span id="an_16:2">16:2</span> He called him, and said to him, 'What is
this that I hear about you? Give an accounting of your management, for
you can no longer be manager.'

<span id="an_16:3">16:3</span> "The manager said within himself, 'What
will I do, seeing that my lord is taking away the management position
from me? I don't have strength to dig. I am ashamed to beg.

<span id="an_16:4">16:4</span> I know what I will do, so that when I am
removed from management, they may receive me into their houses.'

<span id="an_16:5">16:5</span> Calling each one of his lord's debtors to
him, he said to the first, 'How much do you owe to my lord?'

<span id="an_16:6">16:6</span> He said, 'A hundred batos of oil.' He
said to him, 'Take your bill, and sit down quickly and write fifty.'

<span id="an_16:7">16:7</span> Then he said to another, 'How much do you
owe?' He said, 'A hundred cors of wheat.' He said to him, 'Take your
bill, and write eighty.'

<span id="an_16:8">16:8</span> "His lord commended the dishonest manager
because he had done wisely, for the children of this world are, in their
own generation, wiser than the children of the light.

<span id="an_16:9">16:9</span> I tell you, make for yourselves friends
by means of unrighteous mammon, so that when you fail, they may receive
you into the eternal tents.

<span id="an_16:10">16:10</span> He who is faithful in a very little is
faithful also in much. He who is dishonest in a very little is also
dishonest in much.

<span id="an_16:11">16:11</span> If therefore you have not been faithful
in the unrighteous mammon, who will commit to your trust the true
riches?

<span id="an_16:12">16:12</span> If you have not been faithful in that
which is another's, who will give you that which is your own?

<span id="an_16:13">16:13</span> No servant can serve two masters, for
either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to
one, and despise the other. You aren't able to serve God and mammon."

<span id="an_16:14">16:14</span> The Pharisees, who were lovers of
money, also heard all these things, and they scoffed at him.

<span id="an_16:15">16:15</span> He said to them, "You are those who
justify yourselves in the sight of men, but God knows your hearts. For
that which is exalted among men is an abomination in the sight of God.

<span id="an_16:16">16:16</span> The law and the prophets were until
John. From that time the Good News of the Kingdom of God is preached,
and everyone is forcing his way into it.

<span id="an_16:17">16:17</span> But it is easier for heaven and earth
to pass away, than for one tiny stroke of a pen in the law to fall.

<span id="an_16:18">16:18</span> Everyone who divorces his wife, and
marries another, commits adultery. He who marries one who is divorced
from a husband commits adultery.

<span id="an_16:19">16:19</span> "Now there was a certain rich man, and
he was clothed in purple and fine linen, living in luxury every day.

<span id="an_16:20">16:20</span> A certain beggar, named Lazarus, was
laid at his gate, full of sores,

<span id="an_16:21">16:21</span> and desiring to be fed with the crumbs
that fell from the rich man's table. Yes, even the dogs came and licked
his sores.

<span id="an_16:22">16:22</span> It happened that the beggar died, and
that he was carried away by the angels to Abraham's bosom. The rich man
also died, and was buried.

<span id="an_16:23">16:23</span> In Hades, he lifted up his eyes, being
in torment, and saw Abraham far off, and Lazarus at his bosom.

<span id="an_16:24">16:24</span> He cried and said, 'Father Abraham,
have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his
finger in water, and cool my tongue! For I am in anguish in this flame.'

<span id="an_16:25">16:25</span> "But Abraham said, 'Son, remember that
you, in your lifetime, received your good things, and Lazarus, in the
same way, bad things. But now here he is comforted and you are in
anguish.

<span id="an_16:26">16:26</span> Besides all this, between us and you
there is a great gulf fixed, that those who want to pass from here to
you are not able, and that none may cross over from there to us.'

<span id="an_16:27">16:27</span> "He said, 'I ask you therefore, father,
that you would send him to my father's house;

<span id="an_16:28">16:28</span> for I have five brothers, that he may
testify to them, so they won't also come into this place of torment.'

<span id="an_16:29">16:29</span> "But Abraham said to him, 'They have
Moses and the prophets. Let them listen to them.'

<span id="an_16:30">16:30</span> "He said, 'No, father Abraham, but if
one goes to them from the dead, they will repent.'

<span id="an_16:31">16:31</span> "He said to him, 'If they don't listen
to Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded if one rises
from the dead.'"

<span id="an_17:1">17:1</span> He said to the disciples, "It is
impossible that no occasions of stumbling should come, but woe to him
through whom they come!

<span id="an_17:2">17:2</span> It would be better for him if a millstone
were hung around his neck, and he were thrown into the sea, rather than
that he should cause one of these little ones to stumble.

<span id="an_17:3">17:3</span> Be careful. If your brother sins against
you, rebuke him. If he repents, forgive him.

<span id="an_17:4">17:4</span> If he sins against you seven times in the
day, and seven times returns, saying, 'I repent,' you shall forgive
him."

<span id="an_17:5">17:5</span> The apostles said to the Lord, "Increase
our faith."

<span id="an_17:6">17:6</span> The Lord said, "If you had faith like a
grain of mustard seed, you would tell this sycamore tree, 'Be uprooted,
and be planted in the sea,' and it would obey you.

<span id="an_17:7">17:7</span> But who is there among you, having a
servant plowing or keeping sheep, that will say, when he comes in from
the field, 'Come immediately and sit down at the table,'

<span id="an_17:8">17:8</span> and will not rather tell him, 'Prepare my
supper, clothe yourself properly, and serve me, while I eat and drink.
Afterward you shall eat and drink'?

<span id="an_17:9">17:9</span> Does he thank that servant because he did
the things that were commanded? I think not.

<span id="an_17:10">17:10</span> Even so you also, when you have done
all the things that are commanded you, say, 'We are unworthy servants.
We have done our duty.'"

<span id="an_17:11">17:11</span> It happened as he was on his way to
Jerusalem, that he was passing along the borders of Samaria and Galilee.

<span id="an_17:12">17:12</span> As he entered into a certain village,
ten men who were lepers met him, who stood at a distance.

<span id="an_17:13">17:13</span> They lifted up their voices, saying,
"Jesus, Master, have mercy on us!"

<span id="an_17:14">17:14</span> When he saw them, he said to them, "Go
and show yourselves to the priests." It happened that as they went, they
were cleansed.

<span id="an_17:15">17:15</span> One of them, when he saw that he was
healed, turned back, glorifying God with a loud voice.

<span id="an_17:16">17:16</span> He fell on his face at Jesus' feet,
giving him thanks; and he was a Samaritan.

<span id="an_17:17">17:17</span> Jesus answered, "Weren't the ten
cleansed? But where are the nine?

<span id="an_17:18">17:18</span> Were there none found who returned to
give glory to God, except this stranger?"

<span id="an_17:19">17:19</span> Then he said to him, "Get up, and go
your way. Your faith has healed you."

<span id="an_17:20">17:20</span> Being asked by the Pharisees when the
Kingdom of God would come, he answered them, "The Kingdom of God doesn't
come with observation;

<span id="an_17:21">17:21</span> neither will they say, 'Look, here!'
or, 'Look, there!' for behold, the Kingdom of God is within you."

<span id="an_17:22">17:22</span> He said to the disciples, "The days
will come, when you will desire to see one of the days of the Son of
Man, and you will not see it.

<span id="an_17:23">17:23</span> They will tell you, 'Look, here!' or
'Look, there!' Don't go away, nor follow after them,

<span id="an_17:24">17:24</span> for as the lightning, when it flashes
out of the one part under the sky, shines to the other part under the
sky; so will the Son of Man be in his day.

<span id="an_17:25">17:25</span> But first, he must suffer many things
and be rejected by this generation.

<span id="an_17:26">17:26</span> As it happened in the days of Noah,
even so will it be also in the days of the Son of Man.

<span id="an_17:27">17:27</span> They ate, they drank, they married,
they were given in marriage, until the day that Noah entered into the
ship, and the flood came, and destroyed them all.

<span id="an_17:28">17:28</span> Likewise, even as it happened in the
days of Lot: they ate, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted,
they built;

<span id="an_17:29">17:29</span> but in the day that Lot went out from
Sodom, it rained fire and sulfur from the sky, and destroyed them all.

<span id="an_17:30">17:30</span> It will be the same way in the day that
the Son of Man is revealed.

<span id="an_17:31">17:31</span> In that day, he who will be on the
housetop, and his goods in the house, let him not go down to take them
away. Let him who is in the field likewise not turn back.

<span id="an_17:32">17:32</span> Remember Lot's wife!

<span id="an_17:33">17:33</span> Whoever seeks to save his life loses
it, but whoever loses his life preserves it.

<span id="an_17:34">17:34</span> I tell you, in that night there will be
two people in one bed. The one will be taken, and the other will be
left.

<span id="an_17:35">17:35</span> There will be two grinding grain
together. One will be taken, and the other will be left."

<span id="an_17:37">17:37</span> They, answering, asked him, "Where,
Lord?" He said to them, "Where the body is, there will the vultures also
be gathered together."

<span id="an_18:1">18:1</span> He also spoke a parable to them that they
must always pray, and not give up,

<span id="an_18:2">18:2</span> saying, "There was a judge in a certain
city who didn't fear God, and didn't respect man.

<span id="an_18:3">18:3</span> A widow was in that city, and she often
came to him, saying, 'Defend me from my adversary!'

<span id="an_18:4">18:4</span> He wouldn't for a while, but afterward he
said to himself, 'Though I neither fear God, nor respect man,

<span id="an_18:5">18:5</span> yet because this widow bothers me, I will
defend her, or else she will wear me out by her continual coming.'"

<span id="an_18:6">18:6</span> The Lord said, "Listen to what the
unrighteous judge says.

<span id="an_18:7">18:7</span> Won't God avenge his chosen ones, who are
crying out to him day and night, and yet he exercises patience with
them?

<span id="an_18:8">18:8</span> I tell you that he will avenge them
quickly. Nevertheless, when the Son of Man comes, will he find faith on
the earth?"

<span id="an_18:9">18:9</span> He spoke also this parable to certain
people who were convinced of their own righteousness, and who despised
all others.

<span id="an_18:10">18:10</span> "Two men went up into the temple to
pray; one was a Pharisee, and the other was a tax collector.

<span id="an_18:11">18:11</span> The Pharisee stood and prayed to
himself like this: 'God, I thank you, that I am not like the rest of
men, extortioners, unrighteous, adulterers, or even like this tax
collector.

<span id="an_18:12">18:12</span> I fast twice a week. I give tithes of
all that I get.'

<span id="an_18:13">18:13</span> But the tax collector, standing far
away, wouldn't even lift up his eyes to heaven, but beat his breast,
saying, 'God, be merciful to me, a sinner!'

<span id="an_18:14">18:14</span> I tell you, this man went down to his
house justified rather than the other; for everyone who exalts himself
will be humbled, but he who humbles himself will be exalted."

<span id="an_18:15">18:15</span> They were also bringing their babies to
him, that he might touch them. But when the disciples saw it, they
rebuked them.

<span id="an_18:16">18:16</span> Jesus summoned them, saying, "Allow the
little children to come to me, and don't hinder them, for the Kingdom of
God belongs to such as these.

<span id="an_18:17">18:17</span> Most certainly, I tell you, whoever
doesn't receive the Kingdom of God like a little child, he will in no
way enter into it."

<span id="an_18:18">18:18</span> A certain ruler asked him, saying,
"Good Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?"

<span id="an_18:19">18:19</span> Jesus asked him, "Why do you call me
good? No one is good, except one--God.

<span id="an_18:20">18:20</span> You know the commandments: 'Don't
commit adultery,' 'Don't murder,' 'Don't steal,' 'Don't give false
testimony,' 'Honor your father and your mother.'"

<span id="an_18:21">18:21</span> He said, "I have observed all these
things from my youth up."

<span id="an_18:22">18:22</span> When Jesus heard these things, he said
to him, "You still lack one thing. Sell all that you have, and
distribute it to the poor. You will have treasure in heaven. Come,
follow me."

<span id="an_18:23">18:23</span> But when he heard these things, he
became very sad, for he was very rich.

<span id="an_18:24">18:24</span> Jesus, seeing that he became very sad,
said, "How hard it is for those who have riches to enter into the
Kingdom of God!

<span id="an_18:25">18:25</span> For it is easier for a camel to enter
in through a needle's eye, than for a rich man to enter into the Kingdom
of God."

<span id="an_18:26">18:26</span> Those who heard it said, "Then who can
be saved?"

<span id="an_18:27">18:27</span> But he said, "The things which are
impossible with men are possible with God."

<span id="an_18:28">18:28</span> Peter said, "Look, we have left
everything, and followed you."

<span id="an_18:29">18:29</span> He said to them, "Most certainly I tell
you, there is no one who has left house, or wife, or brothers, or
parents, or children, for the Kingdom of God's sake,

<span id="an_18:30">18:30</span> who will not receive many times more in
this time, and in the world to come, eternal life."

<span id="an_18:31">18:31</span> He took the twelve aside, and said to
them, "Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and all the things that are
written through the prophets concerning the Son of Man will be
completed.

<span id="an_18:32">18:32</span> For he will be delivered up to the
Gentiles, will be mocked, treated shamefully, and spit on.

<span id="an_18:33">18:33</span> They will scourge and kill him. On the
third day, he will rise again."

<span id="an_18:34">18:34</span> They understood none of these things.
This saying was hidden from them, and they didn't understand the things
that were said.

<span id="an_18:35">18:35</span> It happened, as he came near Jericho, a
certain blind man sat by the road, begging.

<span id="an_18:36">18:36</span> Hearing a multitude going by, he asked
what this meant.

<span id="an_18:37">18:37</span> They told him that Jesus of Nazareth
was passing by.

<span id="an_18:38">18:38</span> He cried out, "Jesus, you son of David,
have mercy on me!"

<span id="an_18:39">18:39</span> Those who led the way rebuked him, that
he should be quiet; but he cried out all the more, "You son of David,
have mercy on me!"

<span id="an_18:40">18:40</span> Standing still, Jesus commanded him to
be brought to him. When he had come near, he asked him,

<span id="an_18:41">18:41</span> "What do you want me to do?" He said,
"Lord, that I may see again."

<span id="an_18:42">18:42</span> Jesus said to him, "Receive your sight.
Your faith has healed you."

<span id="an_18:43">18:43</span> Immediately he received his sight, and
followed him, glorifying God. All the people, when they saw it, praised
God.

<span id="an_19:1">19:1</span> He entered and was passing through
Jericho.

<span id="an_19:2">19:2</span> There was a man named Zacchaeus. He was a
chief tax collector, and he was rich.

<span id="an_19:3">19:3</span> He was trying to see who Jesus was, and
couldn't because of the crowd, because he was short.

<span id="an_19:4">19:4</span> He ran on ahead, and climbed up into a
sycamore tree to see him, for he was to pass that way.

<span id="an_19:5">19:5</span> When Jesus came to the place, he looked
up and saw him, and said to him, "Zacchaeus, hurry and come down, for
today I must stay at your house."

<span id="an_19:6">19:6</span> He hurried, came down, and received him
joyfully.

<span id="an_19:7">19:7</span> When they saw it, they all murmured,
saying, "He has gone in to lodge with a man who is a sinner."

<span id="an_19:8">19:8</span> Zacchaeus stood and said to the Lord,
"Behold, Lord, half of my goods I give to the poor. If I have wrongfully
exacted anything of anyone, I restore four times as much."

<span id="an_19:9">19:9</span> Jesus said to him, "Today, salvation has
come to this house, because he also is a son of Abraham.

<span id="an_19:10">19:10</span> For the Son of Man came to seek and to
save that which was lost."

<span id="an_19:11">19:11</span> As they heard these things, he went on
and told a parable, because he was near Jerusalem, and they supposed
that the Kingdom of God would be revealed immediately.

<span id="an_19:12">19:12</span> He said therefore, "A certain nobleman
went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom, and to return.

<span id="an_19:13">19:13</span> He called ten servants of his, and gave
them ten mina coins, and told them, 'Conduct business until I come.'

<span id="an_19:14">19:14</span> But his citizens hated him, and sent an
envoy after him, saying, 'We don't want this man to reign over us.'

<span id="an_19:15">19:15</span> "It happened when he had come back
again, having received the kingdom, that he commanded these servants, to
whom he had given the money, to be called to him, that he might know
what they had gained by conducting business.

<span id="an_19:16">19:16</span> The first came before him, saying,
'Lord, your mina has made ten more minas.'

<span id="an_19:17">19:17</span> "He said to him, 'Well done, you good
servant! Because you were found faithful with very little, you shall
have authority over ten cities.'

<span id="an_19:18">19:18</span> "The second came, saying, 'Your mina,
Lord, has made five minas.'

<span id="an_19:19">19:19</span> "So he said to him, 'And you are to be
over five cities.'

<span id="an_19:20">19:20</span> Another came, saying, 'Lord, behold,
your mina, which I kept laid away in a handkerchief,

<span id="an_19:21">19:21</span> for I feared you, because you are an
exacting man. You take up that which you didn't lay down, and reap that
which you didn't sow.'

<span id="an_19:22">19:22</span> "He said to him, 'Out of your own mouth
will I judge you, you wicked servant! You knew that I am an exacting
man, taking up that which I didn't lay down, and reaping that which I
didn't sow.

<span id="an_19:23">19:23</span> Then why didn't you deposit my money in
the bank, and at my coming, I might have earned interest on it?'

<span id="an_19:24">19:24</span> He said to those who stood by, 'Take
the mina away from him, and give it to him who has the ten minas.'

<span id="an_19:25">19:25</span> "They said to him, 'Lord, he has ten
minas!'

<span id="an_19:26">19:26</span> 'For I tell you that to everyone who
has, will more be given; but from him who doesn't have, even that which
he has will be taken away from him.

<span id="an_19:27">19:27</span> But bring those enemies of mine who
didn't want me to reign over them here, and kill them before me.'"

<span id="an_19:28">19:28</span> Having said these things, he went on
ahead, going up to Jerusalem.

<span id="an_19:29">19:29</span> It happened, when he drew near to
Bethsphage and Bethany, at the mountain that is called Olivet, he sent
two of his disciples,

<span id="an_19:30">19:30</span> saying, "Go your way into the village
on the other side, in which, as you enter, you will find a colt tied,
whereon no man ever yet sat. Untie it, and bring it.

<span id="an_19:31">19:31</span> If anyone asks you, 'Why are you
untying it?' say to him: 'The Lord needs it.'"

<span id="an_19:32">19:32</span> Those who were sent went away, and
found things just as he had told them.

<span id="an_19:33">19:33</span> As they were untying the colt, its
owners said to them, "Why are you untying the colt?"

<span id="an_19:34">19:34</span> They said, "The Lord needs it."

<span id="an_19:35">19:35</span> They brought it to Jesus. They threw
their cloaks on the colt, and set Jesus on them.

<span id="an_19:36">19:36</span> As he went, they spread their cloaks in
the way.

<span id="an_19:37">19:37</span> As he was now getting near, at the
descent of the Mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples
began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty
works which they had seen,

<span id="an_19:38">19:38</span> saying, "Blessed is the King who comes
in the name of the Lord! Peace in heaven, and glory in the highest!"

<span id="an_19:39">19:39</span> Some of the Pharisees from the
multitude said to him, "Teacher, rebuke your disciples!"

<span id="an_19:40">19:40</span> He answered them, "I tell you that if
these were silent, the stones would cry out."

<span id="an_19:41">19:41</span> When he drew near, he saw the city and
wept over it,

<span id="an_19:42">19:42</span> saying, "If you, even you, had known
today the things which belong to your peace! But now, they are hidden
from your eyes.

<span id="an_19:43">19:43</span> For the days will come on you, when
your enemies will throw up a barricade against you, surround you, hem
you in on every side,

<span id="an_19:44">19:44</span> and will dash you and your children
within you to the ground. They will not leave in you one stone on
another, because you didn't know the time of your visitation."

<span id="an_19:45">19:45</span> He entered into the temple, and began
to drive out those who bought and sold in it,

<span id="an_19:46">19:46</span> saying to them, "It is written, 'My
house is a house of prayer,' but you have made it a 'den of robbers'!"

<span id="an_19:47">19:47</span> He was teaching daily in the temple,
but the chief priests and the scribes and the leading men among the
people sought to destroy him.

<span id="an_19:48">19:48</span> They couldn't find what they might do,
for all the people hung on to every word that he said.

<span id="an_20:1">20:1</span> It happened on one of those days, as he
was teaching the people in the temple and preaching the Good News, that
the priests and scribes came to him with the elders.

<span id="an_20:2">20:2</span> They asked him, "Tell us: by what
authority do you do these things? Or who is giving you this authority?"

<span id="an_20:3">20:3</span> He answered them, "I also will ask you
one question. Tell me:

<span id="an_20:4">20:4</span> the baptism of John, was it from heaven,
or from men?"

<span id="an_20:5">20:5</span> They reasoned with themselves, saying,
"If we say, 'From heaven,' he will say, 'Why didn't you believe him?'

<span id="an_20:6">20:6</span> But if we say, 'From men,' all the people
will stone us, for they are persuaded that John was a prophet."

<span id="an_20:7">20:7</span> They answered that they didn't know where
it was from.

<span id="an_20:8">20:8</span> Jesus said to them, "Neither will I tell
you by what authority I do these things."

<span id="an_20:9">20:9</span> He began to tell the people this parable.
"A man planted a vineyard, and rented it out to some farmers, and went
into another country for a long time.

<span id="an_20:10">20:10</span> At the proper season, he sent a servant
to the farmers to collect his share of the fruit of the vineyard. But
the farmers beat him, and sent him away empty.

<span id="an_20:11">20:11</span> He sent yet another servant, and they
also beat him, and treated him shamefully, and sent him away empty.

<span id="an_20:12">20:12</span> He sent yet a third, and they also
wounded him, and threw him out.

<span id="an_20:13">20:13</span> The lord of the vineyard said, 'What
shall I do? I will send my beloved son. It may be that seeing him, they
will respect him.'

<span id="an_20:14">20:14</span> "But when the farmers saw him, they
reasoned among themselves, saying, 'This is the heir. Come, let's kill
him, that the inheritance may be ours.'

<span id="an_20:15">20:15</span> They threw him out of the vineyard, and
killed him. What therefore will the lord of the vineyard do to them?

<span id="an_20:16">20:16</span> He will come and destroy these farmers,
and will give the vineyard to others." When they heard it, they said,
"May it never be!"

<span id="an_20:17">20:17</span> But he looked at them, and said, "Then
what is this that is written, 'The stone which the builders rejected,
the same was made the chief cornerstone?'

<span id="an_20:18">20:18</span> Everyone who falls on that stone will
be broken to pieces, but it will crush whomever it falls on to dust."

<span id="an_20:19">20:19</span> The chief priests and the scribes
sought to lay hands on him that very hour, but they feared the
people--for they knew he had spoken this parable against them.

<span id="an_20:20">20:20</span> They watched him, and sent out spies,
who pretended to be righteous, that they might trap him in something he
said, so as to deliver him up to the power and authority of the
governor.

<span id="an_20:21">20:21</span> They asked him, "Teacher, we know that
you say and teach what is right, and aren't partial to anyone, but truly
teach the way of God.

<span id="an_20:22">20:22</span> Is it lawful for us to pay taxes to
Caesar, or not?"

<span id="an_20:23">20:23</span> But he perceived their craftiness, and
said to them, "Why do you test me?

<span id="an_20:24">20:24</span> Show me a denarius. Whose image and
inscription are on it?" They answered, "Caesar's."

<span id="an_20:25">20:25</span> He said to them, "Then give to Caesar
the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's."

<span id="an_20:26">20:26</span> They weren't able to trap him in his
words before the people. They marveled at his answer, and were silent.

<span id="an_20:27">20:27</span> Some of the Sadducees came to him,
those who deny that there is a resurrection.

<span id="an_20:28">20:28</span> They asked him, "Teacher, Moses wrote
to us that if a man's brother dies having a wife, and he is childless,
his brother should take the wife, and raise up children for his brother.

<span id="an_20:29">20:29</span> There were therefore seven brothers.
The first took a wife, and died childless.

<span id="an_20:30">20:30</span> The second took her as wife, and he
died childless.

<span id="an_20:31">20:31</span> The third took her, and likewise the
seven all left no children, and died.

<span id="an_20:32">20:32</span> Afterward the woman also died.

<span id="an_20:33">20:33</span> Therefore in the resurrection whose
wife of them will she be? For the seven had her as a wife."

<span id="an_20:34">20:34</span> Jesus said to them, "The children of
this age marry, and are given in marriage.

<span id="an_20:35">20:35</span> But those who are considered worthy to
attain to that age and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry,
nor are given in marriage.

<span id="an_20:36">20:36</span> For they can't die any more, for they
are like the angels, and are children of God, being children of the
resurrection.

<span id="an_20:37">20:37</span> But that the dead are raised, even
Moses showed at the bush, when he called the Lord 'The God of Abraham,
the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.'

<span id="an_20:38">20:38</span> Now he is not the God of the dead, but
of the living, for all are alive to him."

<span id="an_20:39">20:39</span> Some of the scribes answered, "Teacher,
you speak well."

<span id="an_20:40">20:40</span> They didn't dare to ask him any more
questions.

<span id="an_20:41">20:41</span> He said to them, "Why do they say that
the Christ is David's son?

<span id="an_20:42">20:42</span> David himself says in the book of
Psalms, 'The Lord said to my Lord, "Sit at my right hand,

<span id="an_20:43">20:43</span> until I make your enemies the footstool
of your feet."'

<span id="an_20:44">20:44</span> "David therefore calls him Lord, so how
is he his son?"

<span id="an_20:45">20:45</span> In the hearing of all the people, he
said to his disciples,

<span id="an_20:46">20:46</span> "Beware of the scribes, who like to
walk in long robes, and love greetings in the marketplaces, the best
seats in the synagogues, and the best places at feasts;

<span id="an_20:47">20:47</span> who devour widows' houses, and for a
pretense make long prayers: these will receive greater condemnation."

<span id="an_21:1">21:1</span> He looked up, and saw the rich people who
were putting their gifts into the treasury.

<span id="an_21:2">21:2</span> He saw a certain poor widow casting in
two small brass coins.

<span id="an_21:3">21:3</span> He said, "Truly I tell you, this poor
widow put in more than all of them,

<span id="an_21:4">21:4</span> for all these put in gifts for God from
their abundance, but she, out of her poverty, put in all that she had to
live on."

<span id="an_21:5">21:5</span> As some were talking about the temple and
how it was decorated with beautiful stones and gifts, he said,

<span id="an_21:6">21:6</span> "As for these things which you see, the
days will come, in which there will not be left here one stone on
another that will not be thrown down."

<span id="an_21:7">21:7</span> They asked him, "Teacher, so when will
these things be? What is the sign that these things are about to
happen?"

<span id="an_21:8">21:8</span> He said, "Watch out that you don't get
led astray, for many will come in my name, saying, 'I am he,' and, 'The
time is at hand.' Therefore don't follow them.

<span id="an_21:9">21:9</span> When you hear of wars and disturbances,
don't be terrified, for these things must happen first, but the end
won't come immediately."

<span id="an_21:10">21:10</span> Then he said to them, "Nation will rise
against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.

<span id="an_21:11">21:11</span> There will be great earthquakes,
famines, and plagues in various places. There will be terrors and great
signs from heaven.

<span id="an_21:12">21:12</span> But before all these things, they will
lay their hands on you and will persecute you, delivering you up to
synagogues and prisons, bringing you before kings and governors for my
name's sake.

<span id="an_21:13">21:13</span> It will turn out as a testimony for
you.

<span id="an_21:14">21:14</span> Settle it therefore in your hearts not
to meditate beforehand how to answer,

<span id="an_21:15">21:15</span> for I will give you a mouth and wisdom
which all your adversaries will not be able to withstand or to
contradict.

<span id="an_21:16">21:16</span> You will be handed over even by
parents, brothers, relatives, and friends. They will cause some of you
to be put to death.

<span id="an_21:17">21:17</span> You will be hated by all men for my
name's sake.

<span id="an_21:18">21:18</span> And not a hair of your head will
perish.

<span id="an_21:19">21:19</span> "By your endurance you will win your
lives.

<span id="an_21:20">21:20</span> "But when you see Jerusalem surrounded
by armies, then know that its desolation is at hand.

<span id="an_21:21">21:21</span> Then let those who are in Judea flee to
the mountains. Let those who are in the midst of her depart. Let those
who are in the country not enter therein.

<span id="an_21:22">21:22</span> For these are days of vengeance, that
all things which are written may be fulfilled.

<span id="an_21:23">21:23</span> Woe to those who are pregnant and to
those who nurse infants in those days! For there will be great distress
in the land, and wrath to this people.

<span id="an_21:24">21:24</span> They will fall by the edge of the
sword, and will be led captive into all the nations. Jerusalem will be
trampled down by the Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles are
fulfilled.

<span id="an_21:25">21:25</span> There will be signs in the sun, moon,
and stars; and on the earth anxiety of nations, in perplexity for the
roaring of the sea and the waves;

<span id="an_21:26">21:26</span> men fainting for fear, and for
expectation of the things which are coming on the world: for the powers
of the heavens will be shaken.

<span id="an_21:27">21:27</span> Then they will see the Son of Man
coming in a cloud with power and great glory.

<span id="an_21:28">21:28</span> But when these things begin to happen,
look up, and lift up your heads, because your redemption is near."

<span id="an_21:29">21:29</span> He told them a parable. "See the fig
tree, and all the trees.

<span id="an_21:30">21:30</span> When they are already budding, you see
it and know by your own selves that the summer is already near.

<span id="an_21:31">21:31</span> Even so you also, when you see these
things happening, know that the Kingdom of God is near.

<span id="an_21:32">21:32</span> Most certainly I tell you, this
generation will not pass away until all things are accomplished.

<span id="an_21:33">21:33</span> Heaven and earth will pass away, but my
words will by no means pass away.

<span id="an_21:34">21:34</span> "So be careful, or your hearts will be
loaded down with carousing, drunkenness, and cares of this life, and
that day will come on you suddenly.

<span id="an_21:35">21:35</span> For it will come like a snare on all
those who dwell on the surface of all the earth.

<span id="an_21:36">21:36</span> Therefore be watchful all the time,
praying that you may be counted worthy to escape all these things that
will happen, and to stand before the Son of Man."

<span id="an_21:37">21:37</span> Every day Jesus was teaching in the
temple, and every night he would go out and spend the night on the
mountain that is called Olivet.

<span id="an_21:38">21:38</span> All the people came early in the
morning to him in the temple to hear him.

<span id="an_22:1">22:1</span> Now the feast of unleavened bread, which
is called the Passover, drew near.

<span id="an_22:2">22:2</span> The chief priests and the scribes sought
how they might put him to death, for they feared the people.

<span id="an_22:3">22:3</span> Satan entered into Judas, who was
surnamed Iscariot, who was numbered with the twelve.

<span id="an_22:4">22:4</span> He went away, and talked with the chief
priests and captains about how he might deliver him to them.

<span id="an_22:5">22:5</span> They were glad, and agreed to give him
money.

<span id="an_22:6">22:6</span> He consented, and sought an opportunity
to deliver him to them in the absence of the multitude.

<span id="an_22:7">22:7</span> The day of unleavened bread came, on
which the Passover must be sacrificed.

<span id="an_22:8">22:8</span> He sent Peter and John, saying, "Go and
prepare the Passover for us, that we may eat."

<span id="an_22:9">22:9</span> They said to him, "Where do you want us
to prepare?"

<span id="an_22:10">22:10</span> He said to them, "Behold, when you have
entered into the city, a man carrying a pitcher of water will meet you.
Follow him into the house which he enters.

<span id="an_22:11">22:11</span> Tell the master of the house, 'The
Teacher says to you, "Where is the guest room, where I may eat the
Passover with my disciples?"'

<span id="an_22:12">22:12</span> He will show you a large, furnished
upper room. Make preparations there."

<span id="an_22:13">22:13</span> They went, found things as he had told
them, and they prepared the Passover.

<span id="an_22:14">22:14</span> When the hour had come, he sat down
with the twelve apostles.

<span id="an_22:15">22:15</span> He said to them, "I have earnestly
desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer,

<span id="an_22:16">22:16</span> for I tell you, I will no longer by any
means eat of it until it is fulfilled in the Kingdom of God."

<span id="an_22:17">22:17</span> He received a cup, and when he had
given thanks, he said, "Take this, and share it among yourselves,

<span id="an_22:18">22:18</span> for I tell you, I will not drink at all
again from the fruit of the vine, until the Kingdom of God comes."

<span id="an_22:19">22:19</span> He took bread, and when he had given
thanks, he broke it, and gave to them, saying, "This is my body which is
given for you. Do this in memory of me."

<span id="an_22:20">22:20</span> Likewise, he took the cup after supper,
saying, "This cup is the new covenant in my blood, which is poured out
for you.

<span id="an_22:21">22:21</span> But behold, the hand of him who betrays
me is with me on the table.

<span id="an_22:22">22:22</span> The Son of Man indeed goes, as it has
been determined, but woe to that man through whom he is betrayed!"

<span id="an_22:23">22:23</span> They began to question among
themselves, which of them it was who would do this thing.

<span id="an_22:24">22:24</span> There arose also a contention among
them, which of them was considered to be greatest.

<span id="an_22:25">22:25</span> He said to them, "The kings of the
nations lord it over them, and those who have authority over them are
called 'benefactors.'

<span id="an_22:26">22:26</span> But not so with you. But one who is the
greater among you, let him become as the younger, and one who is
governing, as one who serves.

<span id="an_22:27">22:27</span> For who is greater, one who sits at the
table, or one who serves? Isn't it he who sits at the table? But I am in
the midst of you as one who serves.

<span id="an_22:28">22:28</span> But you are those who have continued
with me in my trials.

<span id="an_22:29">22:29</span> I confer on you a kingdom, even as my
Father conferred on me,

<span id="an_22:30">22:30</span> that you may eat and drink at my table
in my Kingdom. You will sit on thrones, judging the twelve tribes of
Israel."

<span id="an_22:31">22:31</span> The Lord said, "Simon, Simon, behold,
Satan asked to have you, that he might sift you as wheat,

<span id="an_22:32">22:32</span> but I prayed for you, that your faith
wouldn't fail. You, when once you have turned again, establish your
brothers."

<span id="an_22:33">22:33</span> He said to him, "Lord, I am ready to go
with you both to prison and to death!"

<span id="an_22:34">22:34</span> He said, "I tell you, Peter, the
rooster will by no means crow today until you deny that you know me
three times."

<span id="an_22:35">22:35</span> He said to them, "When I sent you out
without purse, and wallet, and shoes, did you lack anything?" They said,
"Nothing."

<span id="an_22:36">22:36</span> Then he said to them, "But now, whoever
has a purse, let him take it, and likewise a wallet. Whoever has none,
let him sell his cloak, and buy a sword.

<span id="an_22:37">22:37</span> For I tell you that this which is
written must still be fulfilled in me: 'He was counted with
transgressors.' For that which concerns me has an end."

<span id="an_22:38">22:38</span> They said, "Lord, behold, here are two
swords." He said to them, "That is enough."

<span id="an_22:39">22:39</span> He came out, and went, as his custom
was, to the Mount of Olives. His disciples also followed him.

<span id="an_22:40">22:40</span> When he was at the place, he said to
them, "Pray that you don't enter into temptation."

<span id="an_22:41">22:41</span> He was withdrawn from them about a
stone's throw, and he knelt down and prayed,

<span id="an_22:42">22:42</span> saying, "Father, if you are willing,
remove this cup from me. Nevertheless, not my will, but yours, be done."

<span id="an_22:43">22:43</span> An angel from heaven appeared to him,
strengthening him.

<span id="an_22:44">22:44</span> Being in agony he prayed more
earnestly. His sweat became like great drops of blood falling down on
the ground.

<span id="an_22:45">22:45</span> When he rose up from his prayer, he
came to the disciples, and found them sleeping because of grief,

<span id="an_22:46">22:46</span> and said to them, "Why do you sleep?
Rise and pray that you may not enter into temptation."

<span id="an_22:47">22:47</span> While he was still speaking, behold, a
multitude, and he who was called Judas, one of the twelve, was leading
them. He came near to Jesus to kiss him.

<span id="an_22:48">22:48</span> But Jesus said to him, "Judas, do you
betray the Son of Man with a kiss?"

<span id="an_22:49">22:49</span> When those who were around him saw what
was about to happen, they said to him, "Lord, shall we strike with the
sword?"

<span id="an_22:50">22:50</span> A certain one of them struck the
servant of the high priest, and cut off his right ear.

<span id="an_22:51">22:51</span> But Jesus answered, "Let me at least do
this"--and he touched his ear, and healed him.

<span id="an_22:52">22:52</span> Jesus said to the chief priests,
captains of the temple, and elders, who had come against him, "Have you
come out as against a robber, with swords and clubs?

<span id="an_22:53">22:53</span> When I was with you in the temple
daily, you didn't stretch out your hands against me. But this is your
hour, and the power of darkness."

<span id="an_22:54">22:54</span> They seized him, and led him away, and
brought him into the high priest's house. But Peter followed from a
distance.

<span id="an_22:55">22:55</span> When they had kindled a fire in the
middle of the courtyard, and had sat down together, Peter sat among
them.

<span id="an_22:56">22:56</span> A certain servant girl saw him as he
sat in the light, and looking intently at him, said, "This man also was
with him."

<span id="an_22:57">22:57</span> He denied Jesus, saying, "Woman, I
don't know him."

<span id="an_22:58">22:58</span> After a little while someone else saw
him, and said, "You also are one of them!" But Peter answered, "Man, I
am not!"

<span id="an_22:59">22:59</span> After about one hour passed, another
confidently affirmed, saying, "Truly this man also was with him, for he
is a Galilean!"

<span id="an_22:60">22:60</span> But Peter said, "Man, I don't know what
you are talking about!" Immediately, while he was still speaking, a
rooster crowed.

<span id="an_22:61">22:61</span> The Lord turned, and looked at Peter.
Then Peter remembered the Lord's word, how he said to him, "Before the
rooster crows you will deny me three times."

<span id="an_22:62">22:62</span> He went out, and wept bitterly.

<span id="an_22:63">22:63</span> The men who held Jesus mocked him and
beat him.

<span id="an_22:64">22:64</span> Having blindfolded him, they struck him
on the face and asked him, "Prophesy! Who is the one who struck you?"

<span id="an_22:65">22:65</span> They spoke many other things against
him, insulting him.

<span id="an_22:66">22:66</span> As soon as it was day, the assembly of
the elders of the people was gathered together, both chief priests and
scribes, and they led him away into their council, saying,

<span id="an_22:67">22:67</span> "If you are the Christ, tell us." But
he said to them, "If I tell you, you won't believe,

<span id="an_22:68">22:68</span> and if I ask, you will in no way answer
me or let me go.

<span id="an_22:69">22:69</span> From now on, the Son of Man will be
seated at the right hand of the power of God."

<span id="an_22:70">22:70</span> They all said, "Are you then the Son of
God?" He said to them, "You say it, because I am."

<span id="an_22:71">22:71</span> They said, "Why do we need any more
witness? For we ourselves have heard from his own mouth!"

<span id="an_23:1">23:1</span> The whole company of them rose up and
brought him before Pilate.

<span id="an_23:2">23:2</span> They began to accuse him, saying, "We
found this man perverting the nation, forbidding paying taxes to Caesar,
and saying that he himself is Christ, a king."

<span id="an_23:3">23:3</span> Pilate asked him, "Are you the King of
the Jews?" He answered him, "So you say."

<span id="an_23:4">23:4</span> Pilate said to the chief priests and the
multitudes, "I find no basis for a charge against this man."

<span id="an_23:5">23:5</span> But they insisted, saying, "He stirs up
the people, teaching throughout all Judea, beginning from Galilee even
to this place."

<span id="an_23:6">23:6</span> But when Pilate heard Galilee mentioned,
he asked if the man was a Galilean.

<span id="an_23:7">23:7</span> When he found out that he was in Herod's
jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who was also in Jerusalem during
those days.

<span id="an_23:8">23:8</span> Now when Herod saw Jesus, he was
exceedingly glad, for he had wanted to see him for a long time, because
he had heard many things about him. He hoped to see some miracle done by
him.

<span id="an_23:9">23:9</span> He questioned him with many words, but he
gave no answers.

<span id="an_23:10">23:10</span> The chief priests and the scribes
stood, vehemently accusing him.

<span id="an_23:11">23:11</span> Herod with his soldiers humiliated him
and mocked him. Dressing him in luxurious clothing, they sent him back
to Pilate.

<span id="an_23:12">23:12</span> Herod and Pilate became friends with
each other that very day, for before that they were enemies with each
other.

<span id="an_23:13">23:13</span> Pilate called together the chief
priests and the rulers and the people,

<span id="an_23:14">23:14</span> and said to them, "You brought this man
to me as one that perverts the people, and see, I have examined him
before you, and found no basis for a charge against this man concerning
those things of which you accuse him.

<span id="an_23:15">23:15</span> Neither has Herod, for I sent you to
him, and see, nothing worthy of death has been done by him.

<span id="an_23:16">23:16</span> I will therefore chastise him and
release him."

<span id="an_23:17">23:17</span> Now he had to release one prisoner to
them at the feast.

<span id="an_23:18">23:18</span> But they all cried out together,
saying, "Away with this man! Release to us Barabbas!"--

<span id="an_23:19">23:19</span> one who was thrown into prison for a
certain revolt in the city, and for murder.

<span id="an_23:20">23:20</span> Then Pilate spoke to them again,
wanting to release Jesus,

<span id="an_23:21">23:21</span> but they shouted, saying, "Crucify!
Crucify him!"

<span id="an_23:22">23:22</span> He said to them the third time, "Why?
What evil has this man done? I have found no capital crime in him. I
will therefore chastise him and release him."

<span id="an_23:23">23:23</span> But they were urgent with loud voices,
asking that he might be crucified. Their voices and the voices of the
chief priests prevailed.

<span id="an_23:24">23:24</span> Pilate decreed that what they asked for
should be done.

<span id="an_23:25">23:25</span> He released him who had been thrown
into prison for insurrection and murder, for whom they asked, but he
delivered Jesus up to their will.

<span id="an_23:26">23:26</span> When they led him away, they grabbed
one Simon of Cyrene, coming from the country, and laid on him the cross,
to carry it after Jesus.

<span id="an_23:27">23:27</span> A great multitude of the people
followed him, including women who also mourned and lamented him.

<span id="an_23:28">23:28</span> But Jesus, turning to them, said,
"Daughters of Jerusalem, don't weep for me, but weep for yourselves and
for your children.

<span id="an_23:29">23:29</span> For behold, the days are coming in
which they will say, 'Blessed are the barren, the wombs that never bore,
and the breasts that never nursed.'

<span id="an_23:30">23:30</span> Then they will begin to tell the
mountains, 'Fall on us!' and tell the hills, 'Cover us.'

<span id="an_23:31">23:31</span> For if they do these things in the
green tree, what will be done in the dry?"

<span id="an_23:32">23:32</span> There were also others, two criminals,
led with him to be put to death.

<span id="an_23:33">23:33</span> When they came to the place that is
called The Skull, they crucified him there with the criminals, one on
the right and the other on the left.

<span id="an_23:34">23:34</span> Jesus said, "Father, forgive them, for
they don't know what they are doing." Dividing his garments among them,
they cast lots.

<span id="an_23:35">23:35</span> The people stood watching. The rulers
with them also scoffed at him, saying, "He saved others. Let him save
himself, if this is the Christ of God, his chosen one!"

<span id="an_23:36">23:36</span> The soldiers also mocked him, coming to
him and offering him vinegar,

<span id="an_23:37">23:37</span> and saying, "If you are the King of the
Jews, save yourself!"

<span id="an_23:38">23:38</span> An inscription was also written over
him in letters of Greek, Latin, and Hebrew: "THIS IS THE KING OF THE
JEWS."

<span id="an_23:39">23:39</span> One of the criminals who was hanged
insulted him, saying, "If you are the Christ, save yourself and us!"

<span id="an_23:40">23:40</span> But the other answered, and rebuking
him said, "Don't you even fear God, seeing you are under the same
condemnation?

<span id="an_23:41">23:41</span> And we indeed justly, for we receive
the due reward for our deeds, but this man has done nothing wrong."

<span id="an_23:42">23:42</span> He said to Jesus, "Lord, remember me
when you come into your Kingdom."

<span id="an_23:43">23:43</span> Jesus said to him, "Assuredly I tell
you, today you will be with me in Paradise."

<span id="an_23:44">23:44</span> It was now about the sixth hour, and
darkness came over the whole land until the ninth hour.

<span id="an_23:45">23:45</span> The sun was darkened, and the veil of
the temple was torn in two.

<span id="an_23:46">23:46</span> Jesus, crying with a loud voice, said,
"Father, into your hands I commit my spirit!" Having said this, he
breathed his last.

<span id="an_23:47">23:47</span> When the centurion saw what was done,
he glorified God, saying, "Certainly this was a righteous man."

<span id="an_23:48">23:48</span> All the multitudes that came together
to see this, when they saw the things that were done, returned home
beating their breasts.

<span id="an_23:49">23:49</span> All his acquaintances, and the women
who followed with him from Galilee, stood at a distance, watching these
things.

<span id="an_23:50">23:50</span> Behold, a man named Joseph, who was a
member of the council, a good and righteous man

<span id="an_23:51">23:51</span> (he had not consented to their counsel
and deed), from Arimathaea, a city of the Jews, who was also waiting for
the Kingdom of God:

<span id="an_23:52">23:52</span> this man went to Pilate, and asked for
Jesus' body.

<span id="an_23:53">23:53</span> He took it down, and wrapped it in a
linen cloth, and laid him in a tomb that was cut in stone, where no one
had ever been laid.

<span id="an_23:54">23:54</span> It was the day of the Preparation, and
the Sabbath was drawing near.

<span id="an_23:55">23:55</span> The women, who had come with him out of
Galilee, followed after, and saw the tomb, and how his body was laid.

<span id="an_23:56">23:56</span> They returned, and prepared spices and
ointments. On the Sabbath they rested according to the commandment.

<span id="an_24:1">24:1</span> But on the first day of the week, at
early dawn, they and some others came to the tomb, bringing the spices
which they had prepared.

<span id="an_24:2">24:2</span> They found the stone rolled away from the
tomb.

<span id="an_24:3">24:3</span> They entered in, and didn't find the Lord
Jesus' body.

<span id="an_24:4">24:4</span> It happened, while they were greatly
perplexed about this, behold, two men stood by them in dazzling
clothing.

<span id="an_24:5">24:5</span> Becoming terrified, they bowed their
faces down to the earth. They said to them, "Why do you seek the living
among the dead?

<span id="an_24:6">24:6</span> He isn't here, but is risen. Remember
what he told you when he was still in Galilee,

<span id="an_24:7">24:7</span> saying that the Son of Man must be
delivered up into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the
third day rise again?"

<span id="an_24:8">24:8</span> They remembered his words,

<span id="an_24:9">24:9</span> returned from the tomb, and told all
these things to the eleven, and to all the rest.

<span id="an_24:10">24:10</span> Now they were Mary Magdalene, Joanna,
and Mary the mother of James. The other women with them told these
things to the apostles.

<span id="an_24:11">24:11</span> These words seemed to them to be
nonsense, and they didn't believe them.

<span id="an_24:12">24:12</span> But Peter got up and ran to the tomb.
Stooping and looking in, he saw the strips of linen lying by themselves,
and he departed to his home, wondering what had happened.

<span id="an_24:13">24:13</span> Behold, two of them were going that
very day to a village named Emmaus, which was sixty stadia from
Jerusalem.

<span id="an_24:14">24:14</span> They talked with each other about all
of these things which had happened.

<span id="an_24:15">24:15</span> It happened, while they talked and
questioned together, that Jesus himself came near, and went with them.

<span id="an_24:16">24:16</span> But their eyes were kept from
recognizing him.

<span id="an_24:17">24:17</span> He said to them, "What are you talking
about as you walk, and are sad?"

<span id="an_24:18">24:18</span> One of them, named Cleopas, answered
him, "Are you the only stranger in Jerusalem who doesn't know the things
which have happened there in these days?"

<span id="an_24:19">24:19</span> He said to them, "What things?" They
said to him, "The things concerning Jesus, the Nazarene, who was a
prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people;

<span id="an_24:20">24:20</span> and how the chief priests and our
rulers delivered him up to be condemned to death, and crucified him.

<span id="an_24:21">24:21</span> But we were hoping that it was he who
would redeem Israel. Yes, and besides all this, it is now the third day
since these things happened.

<span id="an_24:22">24:22</span> Also, certain women of our company
amazed us, having arrived early at the tomb;

<span id="an_24:23">24:23</span> and when they didn't find his body,
they came saying that they had also seen a vision of angels, who said
that he was alive.

<span id="an_24:24">24:24</span> Some of us went to the tomb, and found
it just like the women had said, but they didn't see him."

<span id="an_24:25">24:25</span> He said to them, "Foolish men, and slow
of heart to believe in all that the prophets have spoken!

<span id="an_24:26">24:26</span> Didn't the Christ have to suffer these
things and to enter into his glory?"

<span id="an_24:27">24:27</span> Beginning from Moses and from all the
prophets, he explained to them in all the Scriptures the things
concerning himself.

<span id="an_24:28">24:28</span> They drew near to the village, where
they were going, and he acted like he would go further.

<span id="an_24:29">24:29</span> They urged him, saying, "Stay with us,
for it is almost evening, and the day is almost over." He went in to
stay with them.

<span id="an_24:30">24:30</span> It happened, that when he had sat down
at the table with them, he took the bread and gave thanks. Breaking it,
he gave to them.

<span id="an_24:31">24:31</span> Their eyes were opened, and they
recognized him, and he vanished out of their sight.

<span id="an_24:32">24:32</span> They said one to another, "Weren't our
hearts burning within us, while he spoke to us along the way, and while
he opened the Scriptures to us?"

<span id="an_24:33">24:33</span> They rose up that very hour, returned
to Jerusalem, and found the eleven gathered together, and those who were
with them,

<span id="an_24:34">24:34</span> saying, "The Lord is risen indeed, and
has appeared to Simon!"

<span id="an_24:35">24:35</span> They related the things that happened
along the way, and how he was recognized by them in the breaking of the
bread.

<span id="an_24:36">24:36</span> As they said these things, Jesus
himself stood among them, and said to them, "Peace be to you."

<span id="an_24:37">24:37</span> But they were terrified and filled with
fear, and supposed that they had seen a spirit.

<span id="an_24:38">24:38</span> He said to them, "Why are you troubled?
Why do doubts arise in your hearts?

<span id="an_24:39">24:39</span> See my hands and my feet, that it is
truly me. Touch me and see, for a spirit doesn't have flesh and bones,
as you see that I have."

<span id="an_24:40">24:40</span> When he had said this, he showed them
his hands and his feet.

<span id="an_24:41">24:41</span> While they still didn't believe for
joy, and wondered, he said to them, "Do you have anything here to eat?"

<span id="an_24:42">24:42</span> They gave him a piece of a broiled fish
and some honeycomb.

<span id="an_24:43">24:43</span> He took them, and ate in front of them.

<span id="an_24:44">24:44</span> He said to them, "This is what I told
you, while I was still with you, that all things which are written in
the law of Moses, the prophets, and the psalms, concerning me must be
fulfilled."

<span id="an_24:45">24:45</span> Then he opened their minds, that they
might understand the Scriptures.

<span id="an_24:46">24:46</span> He said to them, "Thus it is written,
and thus it was necessary for the Christ to suffer and to rise from the
dead the third day,

<span id="an_24:47">24:47</span> and that repentance and remission of
sins should be preached in his name to all the nations, beginning at
Jerusalem.

<span id="an_24:48">24:48</span> You are witnesses of these things.

<span id="an_24:49">24:49</span> Behold, I send forth the promise of my
Father on you. But wait in the city of Jerusalem until you are clothed
with power from on high."

<span id="an_24:50">24:50</span> He led them out as far as Bethany, and
he lifted up his hands, and blessed them.

<span id="an_24:51">24:51</span> It happened, while he blessed them,
that he withdrew from them, and was carried up into heaven.

<span id="an_24:52">24:52</span> They worshiped him, and returned to
Jerusalem with great joy,

<span id="an_24:53">24:53</span> and were continually in the temple,
praising and blessing God. Amen.
