### World English Bible: Jude

<span id="an_1:1">1:1</span> Jude, a servant of Jesus Christ, and
brother of James, to those who are called, sanctified by God the Father,
and kept for Jesus Christ:

<span id="an_1:2">1:2</span> Mercy to you and peace and love be
multiplied.

<span id="an_1:3">1:3</span> Beloved, while I was very eager to write to
you about our common salvation, I was constrained to write to you
exhorting you to contend earnestly for the faith which was once for all
delivered to the saints.

<span id="an_1:4">1:4</span> For there are certain men who crept in
secretly, even those who were long ago written about for this
condemnation: ungodly men, turning the grace of our God into indecency,
and denying our only Master, God, and Lord, Jesus Christ.

<span id="an_1:5">1:5</span> Now I desire to remind you, though you
already know this, that the Lord, having saved a people out of the land
of Egypt, afterward destroyed those who didn't believe.

<span id="an_1:6">1:6</span> Angels who didn't keep their first domain,
but deserted their own dwelling place, he has kept in everlasting bonds
under darkness for the judgment of the great day.

<span id="an_1:7">1:7</span> Even as Sodom and Gomorrah, and the cities
around them, having, in the same way as these, given themselves over to
sexual immorality and gone after strange flesh, are set forth as an
example, suffering the punishment of eternal fire.

<span id="an_1:8">1:8</span> Yet in the same way, these also in their
dreaming defile the flesh, despise authority, and slander celestial
beings.

<span id="an_1:9">1:9</span> But Michael, the archangel, when contending
with the devil and arguing about the body of Moses, dared not bring
against him an abusive condemnation, but said, "May the Lord rebuke
you!"

<span id="an_1:10">1:10</span> But these speak evil of whatever things
they don't know. What they understand naturally, like the creatures
without reason, they are destroyed in these things.

<span id="an_1:11">1:11</span> Woe to them! For they went in the way of
Cain, and ran riotously in the error of Balaam for hire, and perished in
Korah's rebellion.

<span id="an_1:12">1:12</span> These are hidden rocky reefs in your love
feasts when they feast with you, shepherds who without fear feed
themselves; clouds without water, carried along by winds; autumn leaves
without fruit, twice dead, plucked up by the roots;

<span id="an_1:13">1:13</span> wild waves of the sea, foaming out their
own shame; wandering stars, for whom the blackness of darkness has been
reserved forever.

<span id="an_1:14">1:14</span> About these also Enoch, the seventh from
Adam, prophesied, saying, "Behold, the Lord came with ten thousands of
his holy ones,

<span id="an_1:15">1:15</span> to execute judgment on all, and to
convict all the ungodly of all their works of ungodliness which they
have done in an ungodly way, and of all the hard things which ungodly
sinners have spoken against him."

<span id="an_1:16">1:16</span> These are murmurers and complainers,
walking after their lusts (and their mouth speaks proud things), showing
respect of persons to gain advantage.

<span id="an_1:17">1:17</span> But you, beloved, remember the words
which have been spoken before by the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ.

<span id="an_1:18">1:18</span> They said to you that "In the last time
there will be mockers, walking after their own ungodly lusts."

<span id="an_1:19">1:19</span> These are they who cause divisions, and
are sensual, not having the Spirit.

<span id="an_1:20">1:20</span> But you, beloved, keep building up
yourselves on your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Spirit.

<span id="an_1:21">1:21</span> Keep yourselves in the love of God,
looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ to eternal life.

<span id="an_1:22">1:22</span> On some have compassion, making a
distinction,

<span id="an_1:23">1:23</span> and some save, snatching them out of the
fire with fear, hating even the clothing stained by the flesh.

<span id="an_1:24">1:24</span> Now to him who is able to keep them from
stumbling, and to present you faultless before the presence of his glory
in great joy,

<span id="an_1:25">1:25</span> to God our Savior, who alone is wise, be
glory and majesty, dominion and power, both now and forever. Amen.
