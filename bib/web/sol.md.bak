### World English Bible: Song of Solomon

<span id="an_1:1">1:1</span> The Song of songs, which is Solomon's.
Beloved

<span id="an_1:2">1:2</span> Let him kiss me with the kisses of his
mouth; for your love is better than wine.

<span id="an_1:3">1:3</span> Your oils have a pleasing fragrance. Your
name is oil poured forth, therefore the virgins love you.

<span id="an_1:4">1:4</span> Take me away with you. Let us hurry. The
king has brought me into his rooms. Friends We will be glad and rejoice
in you. We will praise your love more than wine! Beloved They are right
to love you.

<span id="an_1:5">1:5</span> I am dark, but lovely, you daughters of
Jerusalem, like Kedar's tents, like Solomon's curtains.

<span id="an_1:6">1:6</span> Don't stare at me because I am dark,
because the sun has scorched me. My mother's sons were angry with me.
They made me keeper of the vineyards. I haven't kept my own vineyard.

<span id="an_1:7">1:7</span> Tell me, you whom my soul loves, where you
graze your flock, where you rest them at noon; For why should I be as
one who is veiled beside the flocks of your companions? Lover

<span id="an_1:8">1:8</span> If you don't know, most beautiful among
women, follow the tracks of the sheep. Graze your young goats beside the
shepherds' tents.

<span id="an_1:9">1:9</span> I have compared you, my love, to a steed in
Pharaoh's chariots.

<span id="an_1:10">1:10</span> Your cheeks are beautiful with earrings,
your neck with strings of jewels.

<span id="an_1:11">1:11</span> We will make you earrings of gold, with
studs of silver. Beloved

<span id="an_1:12">1:12</span> While the king sat at his table, my
perfume spread its fragrance.

<span id="an_1:13">1:13</span> My beloved is to me a sachet of myrrh,
that lies between my breasts.

<span id="an_1:14">1:14</span> My beloved is to me a cluster of henna
blossoms from the vineyards of En Gedi. Lover

<span id="an_1:15">1:15</span> Behold, you are beautiful, my love.
Behold, you are beautiful. Your eyes are doves. Beloved

<span id="an_1:16">1:16</span> Behold, you are beautiful, my beloved,
yes, pleasant; and our couch is verdant. Lover

<span id="an_1:17">1:17</span> The beams of our house are cedars. Our
rafters are firs. Beloved

<span id="an_2:1">2:1</span> I am a rose of Sharon, a lily of the
valleys. Lover

<span id="an_2:2">2:2</span> As a lily among thorns, so is my love among
the daughters. Beloved

<span id="an_2:3">2:3</span> As the apple tree among the trees of the
wood, so is my beloved among the sons. I sat down under his shadow with
great delight, his fruit was sweet to my taste.

<span id="an_2:4">2:4</span> He brought me to the banquet hall. His
banner over me is love.

<span id="an_2:5">2:5</span> Strengthen me with raisins, refresh me with
apples; For I am faint with love.

<span id="an_2:6">2:6</span> His left hand is under my head. His right
hand embraces me.

<span id="an_2:7">2:7</span> I adjure you, daughters of Jerusalem, by
the roes, or by the hinds of the field, that you not stir up, nor awaken
love, until it so desires.

<span id="an_2:8">2:8</span> The voice of my beloved! Behold, he comes,
leaping on the mountains, skipping on the hills.

<span id="an_2:9">2:9</span> My beloved is like a roe or a young hart.
Behold, he stands behind our wall! He looks in at the windows. He
glances through the lattice.

<span id="an_2:10">2:10</span> My beloved spoke, and said to me, "Rise
up, my love, my beautiful one, and come away.

<span id="an_2:11">2:11</span> For, behold, the winter is past. The rain
is over and gone.

<span id="an_2:12">2:12</span> The flowers appear on the earth. The time
of the singing has come, and the voice of the turtledove is heard in our
land.

<span id="an_2:13">2:13</span> The fig tree ripens her green figs. The
vines are in blossom. They give forth their fragrance. Arise, my love,
my beautiful one, and come away." Lover

<span id="an_2:14">2:14</span> My dove in the clefts of the rock, In the
hiding places of the mountainside, Let me see your face. Let me hear
your voice; for your voice is sweet, and your face is lovely.

<span id="an_2:15">2:15</span> Catch for us the foxes, the little foxes
that spoil the vineyards; for our vineyards are in blossom. Beloved

<span id="an_2:16">2:16</span> My beloved is mine, and I am his. He
browses among the lilies.

<span id="an_2:17">2:17</span> Until the day is cool, and the shadows
flee away, turn, my beloved, and be like a roe or a young hart on the
mountains of Bether.

<span id="an_3:1">3:1</span> By night on my bed, I sought him whom my
soul loves. I sought him, but I didn't find him.

<span id="an_3:2">3:2</span> I will get up now, and go about the city;
in the streets and in the squares I will seek him whom my soul loves. I
sought him, but I didn't find him.

<span id="an_3:3">3:3</span> The watchmen who go about the city found
me; "Have you seen him whom my soul loves?"

<span id="an_3:4">3:4</span> I had scarcely passed from them, when I
found him whom my soul loves. I held him, and would not let him go,
until I had brought him into my mother's house, into the room of her who
conceived me.

<span id="an_3:5">3:5</span> I adjure you, daughters of Jerusalem, by
the roes, or by the hinds of the field, that you not stir up, nor awaken
love, until it so desires.

<span id="an_3:6">3:6</span> Who is this who comes up from the
wilderness like pillars of smoke, perfumed with myrrh and frankincense,
with all spices of the merchant?

<span id="an_3:7">3:7</span> Behold, it is Solomon's carriage! Sixty
mighty men are around it, of the mighty men of Israel.

<span id="an_3:8">3:8</span> They all handle the sword, and are expert
in war. Every man has his sword on his thigh, because of fear in the
night.

<span id="an_3:9">3:9</span> King Solomon made himself a carriage of the
wood of Lebanon.

<span id="an_3:10">3:10</span> He made its pillars of silver, its bottom
of gold, its seat of purple, its midst being paved with love, from the
daughters of Jerusalem.

<span id="an_3:11">3:11</span> Go forth, you daughters of Zion, and see
king Solomon, with the crown with which his mother has crowned him, in
the day of his weddings, in the day of the gladness of his heart. Lover

<span id="an_4:1">4:1</span> Behold, you are beautiful, my love. Behold,
you are beautiful. Your eyes are doves behind your veil. Your hair is as
a flock of goats, that descend from Mount Gilead.

<span id="an_4:2">4:2</span> Your teeth are like a newly shorn flock,
which have come up from the washing, where every one of them has twins.
None is bereaved among them.

<span id="an_4:3">4:3</span> Your lips are like scarlet thread. Your
mouth is lovely. Your temples are like a piece of a pomegranate behind
your veil.

<span id="an_4:4">4:4</span> Your neck is like David's tower built for
an armory, whereon a thousand shields hang, all the shields of the
mighty men.

<span id="an_4:5">4:5</span> Your two breasts are like two fawns that
are twins of a roe, which feed among the lilies.

<span id="an_4:6">4:6</span> Until the day is cool, and the shadows flee
away, I will go to the mountain of myrrh, to the hill of frankincense.

<span id="an_4:7">4:7</span> You are all beautiful, my love. There is no
spot in you.

<span id="an_4:8">4:8</span> Come with me from Lebanon, my bride, with
me from Lebanon. Look from the top of Amana, from the top of Senir and
Hermon, from the lions' dens, from the mountains of the leopards.

<span id="an_4:9">4:9</span> You have ravished my heart, my sister, my
bride. You have ravished my heart with one of your eyes, with one chain
of your neck.

<span id="an_4:10">4:10</span> How beautiful is your love, my sister, my
bride! How much better is your love than wine! The fragrance of your
perfumes than all kinds of spices!

<span id="an_4:11">4:11</span> Your lips, my bride, drip like the
honeycomb. Honey and milk are under your tongue. The smell of your
garments is like the smell of Lebanon.

<span id="an_4:12">4:12</span> A locked up garden is my sister, my
bride; a locked up spring, a sealed fountain.

<span id="an_4:13">4:13</span> Your shoots are an orchard of
pomegranates, with precious fruits: henna with spikenard plants,

<span id="an_4:14">4:14</span> spikenard and saffron, calamus and
cinnamon, with every kind of incense tree; myrrh and aloes, with all the
best spices,

<span id="an_4:15">4:15</span> a fountain of gardens, a well of living
waters, flowing streams from Lebanon. Beloved

<span id="an_4:16">4:16</span> Awake, north wind; and come, you south!
Blow on my garden, that its spices may flow out. Let my beloved come
into his garden, and taste his precious fruits. Lover

<span id="an_5:1">5:1</span> I have come into my garden, my sister, my
bride. I have gathered my myrrh with my spice; I have eaten my honeycomb
with my honey; I have drunk my wine with my milk. Friends Eat, friends!
Drink, yes, drink abundantly, beloved. Beloved

<span id="an_5:2">5:2</span> I was asleep, but my heart was awake. It is
the voice of my beloved who knocks: "Open to me, my sister, my love, my
dove, my undefiled; for my head is filled with dew, and my hair with the
dampness of the night."

<span id="an_5:3">5:3</span> I have taken off my robe. Indeed, must I
put it on? I have washed my feet. Indeed, must I soil them?

<span id="an_5:4">5:4</span> My beloved thrust his hand in through the
latch opening. My heart pounded for him.

<span id="an_5:5">5:5</span> I rose up to open for my beloved. My hands
dripped with myrrh, my fingers with liquid myrrh, on the handles of the
lock.

<span id="an_5:6">5:6</span> I opened to my beloved; but my beloved
left; and had gone away. My heart went out when he spoke. I looked for
him, but I didn't find him. I called him, but he didn't answer.

<span id="an_5:7">5:7</span> The watchmen who go about the city found
me. They beat me. They bruised me. The keepers of the walls took my
cloak away from me.

<span id="an_5:8">5:8</span> I adjure you, daughters of Jerusalem, If
you find my beloved, that you tell him that I am faint with love.
Friends

<span id="an_5:9">5:9</span> How is your beloved better than another
beloved, you fairest among women? How is your beloved better than
another beloved, that you do so adjure us? Beloved

<span id="an_5:10">5:10</span> My beloved is white and ruddy. The best
among ten thousand.

<span id="an_5:11">5:11</span> His head is like the purest gold. His
hair is bushy, black as a raven.

<span id="an_5:12">5:12</span> His eyes are like doves beside the water
brooks, washed with milk, mounted like jewels.

<span id="an_5:13">5:13</span> His cheeks are like a bed of spices with
towers of perfumes. His lips are like lilies, dropping liquid myrrh.

<span id="an_5:14">5:14</span> His hands are like rings of gold set with
beryl. His body is like ivory work overlaid with sapphires.

<span id="an_5:15">5:15</span> His legs are like pillars of marble set
on sockets of fine gold. His appearance is like Lebanon, excellent as
the cedars.

<span id="an_5:16">5:16</span> His mouth is sweetness; yes, he is
altogether lovely. This is my beloved, and this is my friend, daughters
of Jerusalem. Friends

<span id="an_6:1">6:1</span> Where has your beloved gone, you fairest
among women? Where has your beloved turned, that we may seek him with
you? Beloved

<span id="an_6:2">6:2</span> My beloved has gone down to his garden, to
the beds of spices, to feed in the gardens, and to gather lilies.

<span id="an_6:3">6:3</span> I am my beloved's, and my beloved is mine.
He browses among the lilies,

<span id="an_6:4">6:4</span> You are beautiful, my love, as Tirzah,
lovely as Jerusalem, awesome as an army with banners.

<span id="an_6:5">6:5</span> Turn away your eyes from me, for they have
overcome me. Your hair is like a flock of goats, that lie along the side
of Gilead.

<span id="an_6:6">6:6</span> Your teeth are like a flock of ewes, which
have come up from the washing; of which every one has twins; none is
bereaved among them.

<span id="an_6:7">6:7</span> Your temples are like a piece of a
pomegranate behind your veil.

<span id="an_6:8">6:8</span> There are sixty queens, eighty concubines,
and virgins without number.

<span id="an_6:9">6:9</span> My dove, my perfect one, is unique. She is
her mother's only daughter. She is the favorite one of her who bore her.
The daughters saw her, and called her blessed; the queens and the
concubines, and they praised her.

<span id="an_6:10">6:10</span> Who is she who looks forth as the
morning, beautiful as the moon, clear as the sun, and awesome as an army
with banners?

<span id="an_6:11">6:11</span> I went down into the nut tree grove, to
see the green plants of the valley, to see whether the vine budded, and
the pomegranates were in flower.

<span id="an_6:12">6:12</span> Without realizing it, my desire set me
with my royal people's chariots. Friends

<span id="an_6:13">6:13</span> Return, return, Shulammite! Return,
return, that we may gaze at you. Lover Why do you desire to gaze at the
Shulammite, as at the dance of Mahanaim?

<span id="an_7:1">7:1</span> How beautiful are your feet in sandals,
prince's daughter! Your rounded thighs are like jewels, the work of the
hands of a skillful workman.

<span id="an_7:2">7:2</span> Your body is like a round goblet, no mixed
wine is wanting. Your waist is like a heap of wheat, set about with
lilies.

<span id="an_7:3">7:3</span> Your two breasts are like two fawns, that
are twins of a roe.

<span id="an_7:4">7:4</span> Your neck is like an ivory tower. Your eyes
are like the pools in Heshbon by the gate of Bathrabbim. Your nose is
like the tower of Lebanon which looks toward Damascus.

<span id="an_7:5">7:5</span> Your head on you is like Carmel. The hair
of your head like purple. The king is held captive in its tresses.

<span id="an_7:6">7:6</span> How beautiful and how pleasant you are,
love, for delights!

<span id="an_7:7">7:7</span> This, your stature, is like a palm tree,
your breasts like its fruit.

<span id="an_7:8">7:8</span> I said, "I will climb up into the palm
tree. I will take hold of its fruit." Let your breasts be like clusters
of the vine, the smell of your breath like apples, Beloved

<span id="an_7:9">7:9</span> Your mouth like the best wine, that goes
down smoothly for my beloved, gliding through the lips of those who are
asleep.

<span id="an_7:10">7:10</span> I am my beloved's. His desire is toward
me.

<span id="an_7:11">7:11</span> Come, my beloved, let us go forth into
the field. Let us lodge in the villages.

<span id="an_7:12">7:12</span> Let's go early up to the vineyards. Let's
see whether the vine has budded, its blossom is open, and the
pomegranates are in flower. There I will give you my love.

<span id="an_7:13">7:13</span> The mandrakes give forth fragrance. At
our doors are all kinds of precious fruits, new and old, which I have
stored up for you, my beloved.

<span id="an_8:1">8:1</span> Oh that you were like my brother, who
nursed from the breasts of my mother! If I found you outside, I would
kiss you; yes, and no one would despise me.

<span id="an_8:2">8:2</span> I would lead you, bringing you into my
mother's house, who would instruct me. I would have you drink spiced
wine, of the juice of my pomegranate.

<span id="an_8:3">8:3</span> His left hand would be under my head. His
right hand would embrace me.

<span id="an_8:4">8:4</span> I adjure you, daughters of Jerusalem, that
you not stir up, nor awaken love, until it so desires. Friends

<span id="an_8:5">8:5</span> Who is this who comes up from the
wilderness, leaning on her beloved? Under the apple tree I aroused you.
There your mother conceived you. There she was in labor and bore you.

<span id="an_8:6">8:6</span> Set me as a seal on your heart, as a seal
on your arm; for love is strong as death. Jealousy is as cruel as Sheol.
Its flashes are flashes of fire, a very flame of Yahweh.

<span id="an_8:7">8:7</span> Many waters can't quench love, neither can
floods drown it. If a man would give all the wealth of his house for
love, he would be utterly scorned. Friends

<span id="an_8:8">8:8</span> We have a little sister. She has no
breasts. What shall we do for our sister in the day when she is to be
spoken for?

<span id="an_8:9">8:9</span> If she is a wall, we will build on her a
turret of silver. if she is a door, we will enclose her with boards of
cedar. Beloved

<span id="an_8:10">8:10</span> I am a wall, and my breasts like towers,
then I was in his eyes like one who found peace.

<span id="an_8:11">8:11</span> Solomon had a vineyard at Baal Hamon. He
leased out the vineyard to keepers. Each was to bring a thousand shekels
of silver for its fruit.

<span id="an_8:12">8:12</span> My own vineyard is before me. The
thousand are for you, Solomon; two hundred for those who tend its fruit.
Lover

<span id="an_8:13">8:13</span> You who dwell in the gardens, with
friends in attendance, let me hear your voice! Beloved

<span id="an_8:14">8:14</span> Come away, my beloved! Be like a gazelle
or a young stag on the mountains of spices!
