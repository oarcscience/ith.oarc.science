### World English Bible: Nahum

<span id="an_1:1">1:1</span> An oracle about Nineveh. The book of the
vision of Nahum the Elkoshite.

<span id="an_1:2">1:2</span> Yahweh is a jealous God and avenges. Yahweh
avenges and is full of wrath. Yahweh takes vengeance on his adversaries,
and he maintains wrath against his enemies.

<span id="an_1:3">1:3</span> Yahweh is slow to anger, and great in
power, and will by no means leave the guilty unpunished. Yahweh has his
way in the whirlwind and in the storm, and the clouds are the dust of
his feet.

<span id="an_1:4">1:4</span> He rebukes the sea, and makes it dry, and
dries up all the rivers. Bashan languishes, and Carmel; and the flower
of Lebanon languishes.

<span id="an_1:5">1:5</span> The mountains quake before him, and the
hills melt away. The earth trembles at his presence, yes, the world, and
all who dwell in it.

<span id="an_1:6">1:6</span> Who can stand before his indignation? Who
can endure the fierceness of his anger? His wrath is poured out like
fire, and the rocks are broken apart by him.

<span id="an_1:7">1:7</span> Yahweh is good, a stronghold in the day of
trouble; and he knows those who take refuge in him.

<span id="an_1:8">1:8</span> But with an overflowing flood, he will make
a full end of her place, and will pursue his enemies into darkness.

<span id="an_1:9">1:9</span> What do you plot against Yahweh? He will
make a full end. Affliction won't rise up the second time.

<span id="an_1:10">1:10</span> For entangled like thorns, and drunken as
with their drink, they are consumed utterly like dry stubble.

<span id="an_1:11">1:11</span> There is one gone forth out of you, who
devises evil against Yahweh, who counsels wickedness.

<span id="an_1:12">1:12</span> Thus says Yahweh: "Though they be in full
strength, and likewise many, even so they will be cut down, and he shall
pass away. Though I have afflicted you, I will afflict you no more.

<span id="an_1:13">1:13</span> Now will I break his yoke from off you,
and will burst your bonds apart."

<span id="an_1:14">1:14</span> Yahweh has commanded concerning you: "No
more descendants will bear your name. Out of the house of your gods,
will I cut off the engraved image and the molten image. I will make your
grave, for you are vile."

<span id="an_1:15">1:15</span> Behold, on the mountains the feet of him
who brings good news, who publishes peace! Keep your feasts, Judah!
Perform your vows, for the wicked one will no more pass through you. He
is utterly cut off.

<span id="an_2:1">2:1</span> He who dashes in pieces has come up against
you. Keep the fortress! Watch the way! Strengthen your waist! Fortify
your power mightily!

<span id="an_2:2">2:2</span> For Yahweh restores the excellency of
Jacob, as the excellency of Israel; for the destroyers have destroyed
them, and ruined their vine branches.

<span id="an_2:3">2:3</span> The shield of his mighty men is made red.
The valiant men are in scarlet. The chariots flash with steel in the day
of his preparation, and the pine spears are brandished.

<span id="an_2:4">2:4</span> The chariots rage in the streets. They rush
back and forth in the broad ways. Their appearance is like torches. They
run like the lightnings.

<span id="an_2:5">2:5</span> He summons his picked troops. They stumble
on their way. They dash to its wall, and the protective shield is put in
place.

<span id="an_2:6">2:6</span> The gates of the rivers are opened, and the
palace is dissolved.

<span id="an_2:7">2:7</span> It is decreed: she is uncovered, she is
carried away; and her handmaids moan as with the voice of doves, beating
on their breasts.

<span id="an_2:8">2:8</span> But Nineveh has been from of old like a
pool of water, yet they flee away. "Stop! Stop!" they cry, but no one
looks back.

<span id="an_2:9">2:9</span> Take the spoil of silver. Take the spoil of
gold, for there is no end of the store, the glory of all goodly
furniture.

<span id="an_2:10">2:10</span> She is empty, void, and waste. The heart
melts, the knees knock together, their bodies and faces have grown pale.

<span id="an_2:11">2:11</span> Where is the den of the lions, and the
feeding place of the young lions, where the lion and the lioness walked,
the lion's cubs, and no one made them afraid?

<span id="an_2:12">2:12</span> The lion tore in pieces enough for his
cubs, and strangled for his lionesses, and filled his caves with the
kill, and his dens with prey.

<span id="an_2:13">2:13</span> "Behold, I am against you," says Yahweh
of Armies, "and I will burn her chariots in the smoke, and the sword
will devour your young lions; and I will cut off your prey from the
earth, and the voice of your messengers will no longer be heard."

<span id="an_3:1">3:1</span> Woe to the bloody city! It is all full of
lies and robbery. The prey doesn't depart.

<span id="an_3:2">3:2</span> The noise of the whip, the noise of the
rattling of wheels, prancing horses, and bounding chariots,

<span id="an_3:3">3:3</span> the horseman mounting, and the flashing
sword, the glittering spear, and a multitude of slain, and a great heap
of corpses, and there is no end of the bodies. They stumble on their
bodies,

<span id="an_3:4">3:4</span> because of the multitude of the
prostitution of the alluring prostitute, the mistress of witchcraft, who
sells nations through her prostitution, and families through her
witchcraft.

<span id="an_3:5">3:5</span> "Behold, I am against you," says Yahweh of
Armies, "and I will lift your skirts over your face. I will show the
nations your nakedness, and the kingdoms your shame.

<span id="an_3:6">3:6</span> I will throw abominable filth on you, and
make you vile, and will set you a spectacle.

<span id="an_3:7">3:7</span> It will happen that all those who look at
you will flee from you, and say, 'Nineveh is laid waste! Who will mourn
for her?' Where will I seek comforters for you?"

<span id="an_3:8">3:8</span> Are you better than No-Amon, who was
situated among the rivers, who had the waters around her; whose rampart
was the sea, and her wall was of the sea?

<span id="an_3:9">3:9</span> Cush and Egypt were her boundless strength.
Put and Libya were her helpers.

<span id="an_3:10">3:10</span> Yet was she carried away. She went into
captivity. Her young children also were dashed in pieces at the head of
all the streets, and they cast lots for her honorable men, and all her
great men were bound in chains.

<span id="an_3:11">3:11</span> You also will be drunken. You will be
hidden. You also will seek a stronghold because of the enemy.

<span id="an_3:12">3:12</span> All your fortresses will be like fig
trees with the first-ripe figs: if they are shaken, they fall into the
mouth of the eater.

<span id="an_3:13">3:13</span> Behold, your troops in your midst are
women. The gates of your land are set wide open to your enemies. The
fire has devoured your bars.

<span id="an_3:14">3:14</span> Draw water for the siege. Strengthen your
fortresses. Go into the clay, and tread the mortar. Make the brick kiln
strong.

<span id="an_3:15">3:15</span> There the fire will devour you. The sword
will cut you off. It will devour you like the grasshopper. Multiply like
grasshoppers. Multiply like the locust.

<span id="an_3:16">3:16</span> You have increased your merchants more
than the stars of the skies. The grasshopper strips, and flees away.

<span id="an_3:17">3:17</span> Your guards are like the locusts, and
your officials like the swarms of locusts, which settle on the walls on
a cold day, but when the sun appears, they flee away, and their place is
not known where they are.

<span id="an_3:18">3:18</span> Your shepherds slumber, king of Assyria.
Your nobles lie down. Your people are scattered on the mountains, and
there is no one to gather them.

<span id="an_3:19">3:19</span> There is no healing your wound, for your
injury is fatal. All who hear the report of you clap their hands over
you; for who hasn't felt your endless cruelty?
