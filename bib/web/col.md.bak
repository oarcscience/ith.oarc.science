### World English Bible: Colossians

<span id="an_1:1">1:1</span> Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus through
the will of God, and Timothy our brother,

<span id="an_1:2">1:2</span> to the saints and faithful brothers in
Christ at Colossae: Grace to you and peace from God our Father, and the
Lord Jesus Christ.

<span id="an_1:3">1:3</span> We give thanks to God the Father of our
Lord Jesus Christ, praying always for you,

<span id="an_1:4">1:4</span> having heard of your faith in Christ Jesus,
and of the love which you have toward all the saints,

<span id="an_1:5">1:5</span> because of the hope which is laid up for
you in the heavens, of which you heard before in the word of the truth
of the Good News,

<span id="an_1:6">1:6</span> which has come to you; even as it is in all
the world and is bearing fruit and growing, as it does in you also,
since the day you heard and knew the grace of God in truth;

<span id="an_1:7">1:7</span> even as you learned of Epaphras our beloved
fellow servant, who is a faithful servant of Christ on our behalf,

<span id="an_1:8">1:8</span> who also declared to us your love in the
Spirit.

<span id="an_1:9">1:9</span> For this cause, we also, since the day we
heard this, don't cease praying and making requests for you, that you
may be filled with the knowledge of his will in all spiritual wisdom and
understanding,

<span id="an_1:10">1:10</span> that you may walk worthily of the Lord,
to please him in all respects, bearing fruit in every good work, and
increasing in the knowledge of God;

<span id="an_1:11">1:11</span> strengthened with all power, according to
the might of his glory, for all endurance and perseverance with joy;

<span id="an_1:12">1:12</span> giving thanks to the Father, who made us
fit to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light;

<span id="an_1:13">1:13</span> who delivered us out of the power of
darkness, and translated us into the Kingdom of the Son of his love;

<span id="an_1:14">1:14</span> in whom we have our redemption, the
forgiveness of our sins;

<span id="an_1:15">1:15</span> who is the image of the invisible God,
the firstborn of all creation.

<span id="an_1:16">1:16</span> For by him all things were created, in
the heavens and on the earth, things visible and things invisible,
whether thrones or dominions or principalities or powers; all things
have been created through him, and for him.

<span id="an_1:17">1:17</span> He is before all things, and in him all
things are held together.

<span id="an_1:18">1:18</span> He is the head of the body, the assembly,
who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all things he
might have the preeminence.

<span id="an_1:19">1:19</span> For all the fullness was pleased to dwell
in him;

<span id="an_1:20">1:20</span> and through him to reconcile all things
to himself, by him, whether things on the earth, or things in the
heavens, having made peace through the blood of his cross.

<span id="an_1:21">1:21</span> You, being in past times alienated and
enemies in your mind in your evil works,

<span id="an_1:22">1:22</span> yet now he has reconciled in the body of
his flesh through death, to present you holy and without blemish and
blameless before him,

<span id="an_1:23">1:23</span> if it is so that you continue in the
faith, grounded and steadfast, and not moved away from the hope of the
Good News which you heard, which is being proclaimed in all creation
under heaven; of which I, Paul, was made a servant.

<span id="an_1:24">1:24</span> Now I rejoice in my sufferings for your
sake, and fill up on my part that which is lacking of the afflictions of
Christ in my flesh for his body's sake, which is the assembly;

<span id="an_1:25">1:25</span> of which I was made a servant, according
to the stewardship of God which was given me toward you, to fulfill the
word of God,

<span id="an_1:26">1:26</span> the mystery which has been hidden for
ages and generations. But now it has been revealed to his saints,

<span id="an_1:27">1:27</span> to whom God was pleased to make known
what are the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles,
which is Christ in you, the hope of glory;

<span id="an_1:28">1:28</span> whom we proclaim, admonishing every man
and teaching every man in all wisdom, that we may present every man
perfect in Christ Jesus;

<span id="an_1:29">1:29</span> for which I also labor, striving
according to his working, which works in me mightily.

<span id="an_2:1">2:1</span> For I desire to have you know how greatly I
struggle for you, and for those at Laodicea, and for as many as have not
seen my face in the flesh;

<span id="an_2:2">2:2</span> that their hearts may be comforted, they
being knit together in love, and gaining all riches of the full
assurance of understanding, that they may know the mystery of God, both
of the Father and of Christ,

<span id="an_2:3">2:3</span> in whom are all the treasures of wisdom and
knowledge hidden.

<span id="an_2:4">2:4</span> Now this I say that no one may delude you
with persuasiveness of speech.

<span id="an_2:5">2:5</span> For though I am absent in the flesh, yet am
I with you in the spirit, rejoicing and seeing your order, and the
steadfastness of your faith in Christ.

<span id="an_2:6">2:6</span> As therefore you received Christ Jesus, the
Lord, walk in him,

<span id="an_2:7">2:7</span> rooted and built up in him, and established
in the faith, even as you were taught, abounding in it in thanksgiving.

<span id="an_2:8">2:8</span> Be careful that you don't let anyone rob
you through his philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men,
after the elements of the world, and not after Christ.

<span id="an_2:9">2:9</span> For in him all the fullness of the Godhead
dwells bodily,

<span id="an_2:10">2:10</span> and in him you are made full, who is the
head of all principality and power;

<span id="an_2:11">2:11</span> in whom you were also circumcised with a
circumcision not made with hands, in the putting off of the body of the
sins of the flesh, in the circumcision of Christ;

<span id="an_2:12">2:12</span> having been buried with him in baptism,
in which you were also raised with him through faith in the working of
God, who raised him from the dead.

<span id="an_2:13">2:13</span> You were dead through your trespasses and
the uncircumcision of your flesh. He made you alive together with him,
having forgiven us all our trespasses,

<span id="an_2:14">2:14</span> wiping out the handwriting in ordinances
which was against us; and he has taken it out of the way, nailing it to
the cross;

<span id="an_2:15">2:15</span> having stripped the principalities and
the powers, he made a show of them openly, triumphing over them in it.

<span id="an_2:16">2:16</span> Let no one therefore judge you in eating,
or in drinking, or with respect to a feast day or a new moon or a
Sabbath day,

<span id="an_2:17">2:17</span> which are a shadow of the things to come;
but the body is Christ's.

<span id="an_2:18">2:18</span> Let no one rob you of your prize by a
voluntary humility and worshipping of the angels, dwelling in the things
which he has not seen, vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind,

<span id="an_2:19">2:19</span> and not holding firmly to the Head, from
whom all the body, being supplied and knit together through the joints
and ligaments, grows with God's growth.

<span id="an_2:20">2:20</span> If you died with Christ from the elements
of the world, why, as though living in the world, do you subject
yourselves to ordinances,

<span id="an_2:21">2:21</span> "Don't handle, nor taste, nor touch"

<span id="an_2:22">2:22</span> (all of which perish with use), according
to the precepts and doctrines of men?

<span id="an_2:23">2:23</span> Which things indeed appear like wisdom in
self-imposed worship, and humility, and severity to the body; but aren't
of any value against the indulgence of the flesh.

<span id="an_3:1">3:1</span> If then you were raised together with
Christ, seek the things that are above, where Christ is, seated on the
right hand of God.

<span id="an_3:2">3:2</span> Set your mind on the things that are above,
not on the things that are on the earth.

<span id="an_3:3">3:3</span> For you died, and your life is hidden with
Christ in God.

<span id="an_3:4">3:4</span> When Christ, our life, is revealed, then
you will also be revealed with him in glory.

<span id="an_3:5">3:5</span> Put to death therefore your members which
are on the earth: sexual immorality, uncleanness, depraved passion, evil
desire, and covetousness, which is idolatry;

<span id="an_3:6">3:6</span> for which things' sake the wrath of God
comes on the children of disobedience.

<span id="an_3:7">3:7</span> You also once walked in those, when you
lived in them;

<span id="an_3:8">3:8</span> but now you also put them all away: anger,
wrath, malice, slander, and shameful speaking out of your mouth.

<span id="an_3:9">3:9</span> Don't lie to one another, seeing that you
have put off the old man with his doings,

<span id="an_3:10">3:10</span> and have put on the new man, who is being
renewed in knowledge after the image of his Creator,

<span id="an_3:11">3:11</span> where there can't be Greek and Jew,
circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, bondservant,
freeman; but Christ is all, and in all.

<span id="an_3:12">3:12</span> Put on therefore, as God's chosen ones,
holy and beloved, a heart of compassion, kindness, lowliness, humility,
and perseverance;

<span id="an_3:13">3:13</span> bearing with one another, and forgiving
each other, if any man has a complaint against any; even as Christ
forgave you, so you also do.

<span id="an_3:14">3:14</span> Above all these things, walk in love,
which is the bond of perfection.

<span id="an_3:15">3:15</span> And let the peace of God rule in your
hearts, to which also you were called in one body; and be thankful.

<span id="an_3:16">3:16</span> Let the word of Christ dwell in you
richly; in all wisdom teaching and admonishing one another with psalms,
hymns, and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your heart to the
Lord.

<span id="an_3:17">3:17</span> Whatever you do, in word or in deed, do
all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father,
through him.

<span id="an_3:18">3:18</span> Wives, be in subjection to your husbands,
as is fitting in the Lord.

<span id="an_3:19">3:19</span> Husbands, love your wives, and don't be
bitter against them.

<span id="an_3:20">3:20</span> Children, obey your parents in all
things, for this pleases the Lord.

<span id="an_3:21">3:21</span> Fathers, don't provoke your children, so
that they won't be discouraged.

<span id="an_3:22">3:22</span> Servants, obey in all things those who
are your masters according to the flesh, not just when they are looking,
as men pleasers, but in singleness of heart, fearing God.

<span id="an_3:23">3:23</span> And whatever you do, work heartily, as
for the Lord, and not for men,

<span id="an_3:24">3:24</span> knowing that from the Lord you will
receive the reward of the inheritance; for you serve the Lord Christ.

<span id="an_3:25">3:25</span> But he who does wrong will receive again
for the wrong that he has done, and there is no partiality.

<span id="an_4:1">4:1</span> Masters, give to your servants that which
is just and equal, knowing that you also have a Master in heaven.

<span id="an_4:2">4:2</span> Continue steadfastly in prayer, watching
therein with thanksgiving;

<span id="an_4:3">4:3</span> praying together for us also, that God may
open to us a door for the word, to speak the mystery of Christ, for
which I am also in bonds;

<span id="an_4:4">4:4</span> that I may reveal it as I ought to speak.

<span id="an_4:5">4:5</span> Walk in wisdom toward those who are
outside, redeeming the time.

<span id="an_4:6">4:6</span> Let your speech always be with grace,
seasoned with salt, that you may know how you ought to answer each one.

<span id="an_4:7">4:7</span> All my affairs will be made known to you by
Tychicus, the beloved brother, faithful servant, and fellow bondservant
in the Lord.

<span id="an_4:8">4:8</span> I am sending him to you for this very
purpose, that he may know your circumstances and comfort your hearts,

<span id="an_4:9">4:9</span> together with Onesimus, the faithful and
beloved brother, who is one of you. They will make known to you
everything that is going on here.

<span id="an_4:10">4:10</span> Aristarchus, my fellow prisoner, greets
you, and Mark, the cousin of Barnabas (concerning whom you received
commandments, "if he comes to you, receive him"),

<span id="an_4:11">4:11</span> and Jesus who is called Justus. These are
my only fellow workers for the Kingdom of God who are of the
circumcision, men who have been a comfort to me.

<span id="an_4:12">4:12</span> Epaphras, who is one of you, a servant of
Christ, salutes you, always striving for you in his prayers, that you
may stand perfect and complete in all the will of God.

<span id="an_4:13">4:13</span> For I testify about him, that he has
great zeal for you, and for those in Laodicea, and for those in
Hierapolis.

<span id="an_4:14">4:14</span> Luke, the beloved physician, and Demas
greet you.

<span id="an_4:15">4:15</span> Greet the brothers who are in Laodicea,
and Nymphas, and the assembly that is in his house.

<span id="an_4:16">4:16</span> When this letter has been read among you,
cause it to be read also in the assembly of the Laodiceans; and that you
also read the letter from Laodicea.

<span id="an_4:17">4:17</span> Tell Archippus, "Take heed to the
ministry which you have received in the Lord, that you fulfill it."

<span id="an_4:18">4:18</span> The salutation of me, Paul, with my own
hand: remember my bonds. Grace be with you. Amen.
