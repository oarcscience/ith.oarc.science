### World English Bible: Joshua

<span id="an_1:1">1:1</span> Now it happened after the death of Moses
the servant of Yahweh, that Yahweh spoke to Joshua the son of Nun,
Moses' servant, saying,

<span id="an_1:2">1:2</span> "Moses my servant is dead; now therefore
arise, go over this Jordan, you, and all this people, to the land which
I give to them, even to the children of Israel.

<span id="an_1:3">1:3</span> I have given you every place that the sole
of your foot will tread on, as I told Moses.

<span id="an_1:4">1:4</span> From the wilderness, and this Lebanon, even
to the great river, the river Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites,
and to the great sea toward the going down of the sun, shall be your
border.

<span id="an_1:5">1:5</span> No man will be able to stand before you all
the days of your life. As I was with Moses, so I will be with you. I
will not fail you nor forsake you.

<span id="an_1:6">1:6</span> "Be strong and courageous; for you shall
cause this people to inherit the land which I swore to their fathers to
give them.

<span id="an_1:7">1:7</span> Only be strong and very courageous, to
observe to do according to all the law, which Moses my servant commanded
you. Don't turn from it to the right hand or to the left, that you may
have good success wherever you go.

<span id="an_1:8">1:8</span> This book of the law shall not depart out
of your mouth, but you shall meditate on it day and night, that you may
observe to do according to all that is written therein: for then you
shall make your way prosperous, and then you shall have good success.

<span id="an_1:9">1:9</span> Haven't I commanded you? Be strong and
courageous. Don't be afraid, neither be dismayed: for Yahweh your God is
with you wherever you go."

<span id="an_1:10">1:10</span> Then Joshua commanded the officers of the
people, saying,

<span id="an_1:11">1:11</span> "Pass through the midst of the camp, and
command the people, saying, 'Prepare food; for within three days you are
to pass over this Jordan, to go in to possess the land, which Yahweh
your God gives you to possess it.'"

<span id="an_1:12">1:12</span> Joshua spoke to the Reubenites, and to
the Gadites, and to the half-tribe of Manasseh, saying,

<span id="an_1:13">1:13</span> "Remember the word which Moses the
servant of Yahweh commanded you, saying, 'Yahweh your God gives you
rest, and will give you this land.

<span id="an_1:14">1:14</span> Your wives, your little ones, and your
livestock, shall live in the land which Moses gave you beyond the
Jordan; but you shall pass over before your brothers armed, all the
mighty men of valor, and shall help them

<span id="an_1:15">1:15</span> until Yahweh has given your brothers
rest, as he has given you, and they have also possessed the land which
Yahweh your God gives them. Then you shall return to the land of your
possession, and possess it, which Moses the servant of Yahweh gave you
beyond the Jordan toward the sunrise.'"

<span id="an_1:16">1:16</span> They answered Joshua, saying, "All that
you have commanded us we will do, and wherever you send us we will go.

<span id="an_1:17">1:17</span> Just as we listened to Moses in all
things, so will we listen to you. Only may Yahweh your God be with you,
as he was with Moses.

<span id="an_1:18">1:18</span> Whoever rebels against your commandment,
and doesn't listen to your words in all that you command him, he shall
be put to death. Only be strong and courageous."

<span id="an_2:1">2:1</span> Joshua the son of Nun secretly sent two men
out of Shittim as spies, saying, "Go, view the land, including Jericho."
They went and came into the house of a prostitute whose name was Rahab,
and slept there.

<span id="an_2:2">2:2</span> The king of Jericho was told, "Behold, men
of the children of Israel came in here tonight to spy out the land."

<span id="an_2:3">2:3</span> The king of Jericho sent to Rahab, saying,
"Bring out the men who have come to you, who have entered into your
house; for they have come to spy out all the land."

<span id="an_2:4">2:4</span> The woman took the two men and hid them.
Then she said, "Yes, the men came to me, but I didn't know where they
came from.

<span id="an_2:5">2:5</span> It happened about the time of the shutting
of the gate, when it was dark, that the men went out. Where the men
went, I don't know. Pursue them quickly; for you will overtake them."

<span id="an_2:6">2:6</span> But she had brought them up to the roof,
and hid them with the stalks of flax, which she had laid in order on the
roof.

<span id="an_2:7">2:7</span> The men pursued them the way to the Jordan
to the fords: and as soon as those who pursued them had gone out, they
shut the gate.

<span id="an_2:8">2:8</span> Before they had laid down, she came up to
them on the roof;

<span id="an_2:9">2:9</span> and she said to the men, "I know that
Yahweh has given you the land, and that the fear of you has fallen on
us, and that all the inhabitants of the land melt away before you.

<span id="an_2:10">2:10</span> For we have heard how Yahweh dried up the
water of the Red Sea before you, when you came out of Egypt; and what
you did to the two kings of the Amorites, who were beyond the Jordan, to
Sihon and to Og, whom you utterly destroyed.

<span id="an_2:11">2:11</span> As soon as we had heard it, our hearts
melted, neither did there remain any more spirit in any man, because of
you: for Yahweh your God, he is God in heaven above, and on earth
beneath.

<span id="an_2:12">2:12</span> Now therefore, please swear to me by
Yahweh, since I have dealt kindly with you, that you also will deal
kindly with my father's house, and give me a true token;

<span id="an_2:13">2:13</span> and that you will save alive my father,
my mother, my brothers, and my sisters, and all that they have, and will
deliver our lives from death."

<span id="an_2:14">2:14</span> The men said to her, "Our life for yours,
if you don't talk about this business of ours; and it shall be, when
Yahweh gives us the land, that we will deal kindly and truly with you."

<span id="an_2:15">2:15</span> Then she let them down by a cord through
the window; for her house was on the side of the wall, and she lived on
the wall.

<span id="an_2:16">2:16</span> She said to them, "Go to the mountain,
lest the pursuers find you; and hide yourselves there three days, until
the pursuers have returned. Afterward, you may go your way."

<span id="an_2:17">2:17</span> The men said to her, "We will be
guiltless of this your oath which you have made us to swear.

<span id="an_2:18">2:18</span> Behold, when we come into the land, you
shall bind this line of scarlet thread in the window which you did let
us down by. You shall gather to yourself into the house your father,
your mother, your brothers, and all your father's household.

<span id="an_2:19">2:19</span> It shall be that whoever goes out of the
doors of your house into the street, his blood will be on his head, and
we will be guiltless. Whoever is with you in the house, his blood shall
be on our head, if any hand is on him.

<span id="an_2:20">2:20</span> But if you talk about this business of
ours, then we shall be guiltless of your oath which you have made us to
swear."

<span id="an_2:21">2:21</span> She said, "According to your words, so be
it." She sent them away, and they departed. She tied the scarlet line in
the window.

<span id="an_2:22">2:22</span> They went, and came to the mountain, and
stayed there three days, until the pursuers had returned. The pursuers
sought them throughout all the way, but didn't find them.

<span id="an_2:23">2:23</span> Then the two men returned, descended from
the mountain, passed over, and came to Joshua the son of Nun; and they
told him all that had happened to them.

<span id="an_2:24">2:24</span> They said to Joshua, "Truly Yahweh has
delivered into our hands all the land. Moreover, all the inhabitants of
the land melt away before us."

<span id="an_3:1">3:1</span> Joshua rose up early in the morning; and
they moved from Shittim, and came to the Jordan, he and all the children
of Israel. They lodged there before they passed over.

<span id="an_3:2">3:2</span> It happened after three days, that the
officers went through the midst of the camp;

<span id="an_3:3">3:3</span> and they commanded the people, saying,
"When you see the ark of the covenant of Yahweh your God, and the
priests the Levites bearing it, then you shall move from your place, and
follow it.

<span id="an_3:4">3:4</span> Yet there shall be a space between you and
it, about two thousand cubits by measure. Don't come near to it, that
you may know the way by which you must go; for you have not passed this
way before."

<span id="an_3:5">3:5</span> Joshua said to the people, "Sanctify
yourselves; for tomorrow Yahweh will do wonders among you."

<span id="an_3:6">3:6</span> Joshua spoke to the priests, saying, "Take
up the ark of the covenant, and pass over before the people." They took
up the ark of the covenant, and went before the people.

<span id="an_3:7">3:7</span> Yahweh said to Joshua, "Today I will begin
to magnify you in the sight of all Israel, that they may know that as I
was with Moses, so I will be with you.

<span id="an_3:8">3:8</span> You shall command the priests who bear the
ark of the covenant, saying, 'When you come to the brink of the waters
of the Jordan, you shall stand still in the Jordan.'"

<span id="an_3:9">3:9</span> Joshua said to the children of Israel,
"Come here, and hear the words of Yahweh your God."

<span id="an_3:10">3:10</span> Joshua said, "Hereby you shall know that
the living God is among you, and that he will without fail drive the
Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Hivite, and the Perizzite, and the
Girgashite, and the Amorite, and the Jebusite out from before you.

<span id="an_3:11">3:11</span> Behold, the ark of the covenant of the
Lord of all the earth passes over before you into the Jordan.

<span id="an_3:12">3:12</span> Now therefore take twelve men out of the
tribes of Israel, for every tribe a man.

<span id="an_3:13">3:13</span> It shall come to pass, when the soles of
the feet of the priests who bear the ark of Yahweh, the Lord of all the
earth, rest in the waters of the Jordan, that the waters of the Jordan
will be cut off, even the waters that come down from above; and they
shall stand in one heap."

<span id="an_3:14">3:14</span> It happened, when the people moved from
their tents to pass over the Jordan, the priests who bore the ark of the
covenant being before the people,

<span id="an_3:15">3:15</span> and when those who bore the ark had come
to the Jordan, and the feet of the priests who bore the ark had dipped
in the edge of the water (for the Jordan overflows all its banks all the
time of harvest),

<span id="an_3:16">3:16</span> that the waters which came down from
above stood, and rose up in one heap, a great way off, at Adam, the city
that is beside Zarethan; and those that went down toward the sea of the
Arabah, even the Salt Sea, were wholly cut off. Then the people passed
over right against Jericho.

<span id="an_3:17">3:17</span> The priests who bore the ark of the
covenant of Yahweh stood firm on dry ground in the middle of the Jordan;
and all Israel passed over on dry ground, until all the nation had
passed completely over the Jordan.

<span id="an_4:1">4:1</span> It happened, when all the nation had
completely passed over the Jordan, that Yahweh spoke to Joshua, saying,

<span id="an_4:2">4:2</span> "Take twelve men out of the people, out of
every tribe a man,

<span id="an_4:3">4:3</span> and command them, saying, 'Take from out of
the middle of the Jordan, out of the place where the priests' feet stood
firm, twelve stones, and carry them over with you, and lay them down in
the lodging place, where you will lodge tonight.'"

<span id="an_4:4">4:4</span> Then Joshua called the twelve men, whom he
had prepared of the children of Israel, out of every tribe a man.

<span id="an_4:5">4:5</span> Joshua said to them, "Pass over before the
ark of Yahweh your God into the middle of the Jordan, and each of you
pick up a stone and put it on your shoulder, according to the number of
the tribes of the children of Israel;

<span id="an_4:6">4:6</span> that this may be a sign among you, that
when your children ask in time to come, saying, 'What do you mean by
these stones?'

<span id="an_4:7">4:7</span> then you shall tell them, 'Because the
waters of the Jordan were cut off before the ark of the covenant of
Yahweh. When it passed over the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan were
cut off. These stones shall be for a memorial to the children of Israel
forever.'"

<span id="an_4:8">4:8</span> The children of Israel did as Joshua
commanded, and took up twelve stones out of the middle of the Jordan, as
Yahweh spoke to Joshua, according to the number of the tribes of the
children of Israel; and they carried them over with them to the place
where they lodged, and laid them down there.

<span id="an_4:9">4:9</span> Joshua set up twelve stones in the middle
of the Jordan, in the place where the feet of the priests who bore the
ark of the covenant stood; and they are there to this day.

<span id="an_4:10">4:10</span> For the priests who bore the ark stood in
the middle of the Jordan, until everything was finished that Yahweh
commanded Joshua to speak to the people, according to all that Moses
commanded Joshua; and the people hurried and passed over.

<span id="an_4:11">4:11</span> It happened, when all the people had
completely passed over, that the ark of Yahweh passed over, with the
priests, in the presence of the people.

<span id="an_4:12">4:12</span> The children of Reuben, and the children
of Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh, passed over armed before the
children of Israel, as Moses spoke to them.

<span id="an_4:13">4:13</span> About forty thousand men, ready and armed
for war passed over before Yahweh to battle, to the plains of Jericho.

<span id="an_4:14">4:14</span> On that day, Yahweh magnified Joshua in
the sight of all Israel; and they feared him, as they feared Moses, all
the days of his life.

<span id="an_4:15">4:15</span> Yahweh spoke to Joshua, saying,

<span id="an_4:16">4:16</span> "Command the priests who bear the ark of
the testimony, that they come up out of the Jordan."

<span id="an_4:17">4:17</span> Joshua therefore commanded the priests,
saying, "Come up out of the Jordan!"

<span id="an_4:18">4:18</span> It happened, when the priests who bore
the ark of the covenant of Yahweh had come up out of the middle of the
Jordan, and the soles of the priests' feet were lifted up to the dry
ground, that the waters of the Jordan returned to their place, and went
over all its banks, as before.

<span id="an_4:19">4:19</span> The people came up out of the Jordan on
the tenth day of the first month, and encamped in Gilgal, on the east
border of Jericho.

<span id="an_4:20">4:20</span> Joshua set up those twelve stones, which
they took out of the Jordan, in Gilgal.

<span id="an_4:21">4:21</span> He spoke to the children of Israel,
saying, "When your children ask their fathers in time to come, saying,
'What do these stones mean?'

<span id="an_4:22">4:22</span> Then you shall let your children know,
saying, 'Israel came over this Jordan on dry land.

<span id="an_4:23">4:23</span> For Yahweh your God dried up the waters
of the Jordan from before you, until you had passed over, as Yahweh your
God did to the Red Sea, which he dried up from before us, until we had
passed over;

<span id="an_4:24">4:24</span> that all the peoples of the earth may
know the hand of Yahweh, that it is mighty; that you may fear Yahweh
your God forever.'"

<span id="an_5:1">5:1</span> It happened, when all the kings of the
Amorites, who were beyond the Jordan westward, and all the kings of the
Canaanites, who were by the sea, heard how that Yahweh had dried up the
waters of the Jordan from before the children of Israel, until we had
passed over, that their heart melted, neither was there spirit in them
any more, because of the children of Israel.

<span id="an_5:2">5:2</span> At that time, Yahweh said to Joshua, "Make
flint knives, and circumcise again the children of Israel the second
time."

<span id="an_5:3">5:3</span> Joshua made himself flint knives, and
circumcised the children of Israel at the hill of the foreskins.

<span id="an_5:4">5:4</span> This is the reason Joshua circumcised: all
the people who came out of Egypt, who were males, even all the men of
war, died in the wilderness by the way, after they came out of Egypt.

<span id="an_5:5">5:5</span> For all the people who came out were
circumcised; but all the people who were born in the wilderness by the
way as they came out of Egypt had not been circumcised.

<span id="an_5:6">5:6</span> For the children of Israel walked forty
years in the wilderness, until all the nation, even the men of war who
came out of Egypt, were consumed, because they didn't listen to the
voice of Yahweh. Yahweh swore to them that he wouldn't let them see the
land which Yahweh swore to their fathers that he would give us, a land
flowing with milk and honey.

<span id="an_5:7">5:7</span> Their children, whom he raised up in their
place, were circumcised by Joshua; for they were uncircumcised, because
they had not circumcised them on the way.

<span id="an_5:8">5:8</span> It happened, when they were done
circumcising all the nation, that they stayed in their places in the
camp until they were healed.

<span id="an_5:9">5:9</span> Yahweh said to Joshua, "Today I have rolled
away the reproach of Egypt from off you." Therefore the name of that
place was called Gilgal, to this day.

<span id="an_5:10">5:10</span> The children of Israel encamped in
Gilgal. They kept the Passover on the fourteenth day of the month at
evening in the plains of Jericho.

<span id="an_5:11">5:11</span> They ate unleavened cakes and parched
grain of the produce of the land on the next day after the Passover, in
the same day.

<span id="an_5:12">5:12</span> The manna ceased on the next day, after
they had eaten of the produce of the land. The children of Israel didn't
have manna any more; but they ate of the fruit of the land of Canaan
that year.

<span id="an_5:13">5:13</span> It happened, when Joshua was by Jericho,
that he lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, a man stood in front
of him with his sword drawn in his hand. Joshua went to him, and said to
him, "Are you for us, or for our adversaries?"

<span id="an_5:14">5:14</span> He said, "No; but I have come now as
commander of Yahweh's army." Joshua fell on his face to the earth, and
worshipped, and said to him, "What does my lord say to his servant?"

<span id="an_5:15">5:15</span> The prince of Yahweh's army said to
Joshua, "Take your shoes off of your feet; for the place on which you
stand is holy." Joshua did so.

<span id="an_6:1">6:1</span> Now Jericho was tightly shut up because of
the children of Israel. No one went out, and no one came in.

<span id="an_6:2">6:2</span> Yahweh said to Joshua, "Behold, I have
given Jericho into your hand, with its king and the mighty men of valor.

<span id="an_6:3">6:3</span> All your men of war shall march around the
city, going around the city once. You shall do this six days.

<span id="an_6:4">6:4</span> Seven priests shall bear seven trumpets of
rams' horns before the ark. On the seventh day, you shall march around
the city seven times, and the priests shall blow the trumpets.

<span id="an_6:5">6:5</span> It shall be that when they make a long
blast with the ram's horn, and when you hear the sound of the trumpet,
all the people shall shout with a great shout; and the wall of the city
shall fall down flat, and the people shall go up every man straight
before him."

<span id="an_6:6">6:6</span> Joshua the son of Nun called the priests,
and said to them, "Take up the ark of the covenant, and let seven
priests bear seven trumpets of rams' horns before the ark of Yahweh."

<span id="an_6:7">6:7</span> They said to the people, "Advance! March
around the city, and let the armed men pass on before Yahweh's ark."

<span id="an_6:8">6:8</span> It was so, that when Joshua had spoken to
the people, the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams' horns
before Yahweh advanced, and blew the trumpets; and the ark of the
covenant of Yahweh followed them.

<span id="an_6:9">6:9</span> The armed men went before the priests who
blew the trumpets, and the ark went after them. The trumpets sounded as
they went.

<span id="an_6:10">6:10</span> Joshua commanded the people, saying, "You
shall not shout, nor let your voice be heard, neither shall any word
proceed out of your mouth, until the day I tell you to shout. Then you
shall shout."

<span id="an_6:11">6:11</span> So he caused the ark of Yahweh to go
around the city, going about it once. Then they came into the camp, and
lodged in the camp.

<span id="an_6:12">6:12</span> Joshua rose early in the morning, and the
priests took up the ark of Yahweh.

<span id="an_6:13">6:13</span> The seven priests bearing the seven
trumpets of rams' horns before the ark of Yahweh went on continually,
and blew the trumpets: and the armed men went before them. The rear
guard came after the ark of Yahweh. The trumpets sounded as they went.

<span id="an_6:14">6:14</span> The second day they marched around the
city once, and returned into the camp. They did this six days.

<span id="an_6:15">6:15</span> It happened on the seventh day, that they
rose early at the dawning of the day, and marched around the city in the
same way seven times. Only on this day they marched around the city
seven times.

<span id="an_6:16">6:16</span> It happened at the seventh time, when the
priests blew the trumpets, Joshua said to the people, "Shout, for Yahweh
has given you the city!

<span id="an_6:17">6:17</span> The city shall be devoted, even it and
all that is in it, to Yahweh. Only Rahab the prostitute shall live, she
and all who are with her in the house, because she hid the messengers
that we sent.

<span id="an_6:18">6:18</span> But as for you, only keep yourselves from
the devoted thing, lest when you have devoted it, you take of the
devoted thing; so would you make the camp of Israel accursed, and
trouble it.

<span id="an_6:19">6:19</span> But all the silver, and gold, and vessels
of brass and iron, are holy to Yahweh. They shall come into Yahweh's
treasury."

<span id="an_6:20">6:20</span> So the people shouted, and the priests
blew the trumpets. It happened, when the people heard the sound of the
trumpet, that the people shouted with a great shout, and the wall fell
down flat, so that the people went up into the city, every man straight
before him, and they took the city.

<span id="an_6:21">6:21</span> They utterly destroyed all that was in
the city, both man and woman, both young and old, and ox, and sheep, and
donkey, with the edge of the sword.

<span id="an_6:22">6:22</span> Joshua said to the two men who had spied
out the land, "Go into the prostitute's house, and bring out from there
the woman and all that she has, as you swore to her."

<span id="an_6:23">6:23</span> The young men who were spies went in, and
brought out Rahab with her father, her mother, her brothers, and all
that she had. They also brought out all her relatives, and they set them
outside of the camp of Israel.

<span id="an_6:24">6:24</span> They burnt the city with fire, and all
that was in it. Only they put the silver, the gold, and the vessels of
brass and of iron into the treasury of Yahweh's house.

<span id="an_6:25">6:25</span> But Rahab the prostitute, her father's
household, and all that she had, Joshua saved alive. She lived in the
midst of Israel to this day, because she hid the messengers, whom Joshua
sent to spy out Jericho.

<span id="an_6:26">6:26</span> Joshua commanded them with an oath at
that time, saying, "Cursed is the man before Yahweh, who rises up and
builds this city Jericho. With the loss of his firstborn shall he lay
its foundation, and with the loss of his youngest son shall he set up
its gates."

<span id="an_6:27">6:27</span> So Yahweh was with Joshua; and his fame
was in all the land.

<span id="an_7:1">7:1</span> But the children of Israel committed a
trespass in the devoted things; for Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of
Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, took some of the devoted
things. Therefore Yahweh's anger burned against the children of Israel.

<span id="an_7:2">7:2</span> Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which
is beside Beth Aven, on the east side of Bethel, and spoke to them,
saying, "Go up and spy out the land." The men went up and spied out Ai.

<span id="an_7:3">7:3</span> They returned to Joshua, and said to him,
"Don't let all the people go up; but let about two or three thousand men
go up and strike Ai. Don't make all the people to toil there, for there
are only a few of them."

<span id="an_7:4">7:4</span> So about three thousand men of the people
went up there, and they fled before the men of Ai.

<span id="an_7:5">7:5</span> The men of Ai struck about thirty-six men
of them, and they chased them from before the gate even to Shebarim, and
struck them at the descent. The hearts of the people melted, and became
like water.

<span id="an_7:6">7:6</span> Joshua tore his clothes, and fell to the
earth on his face before the ark of Yahweh until the evening, he and the
elders of Israel; and they put dust on their heads.

<span id="an_7:7">7:7</span> Joshua said, "Alas, Lord Yahweh, why have
you brought this people over the Jordan at all, to deliver us into the
hand of the Amorites, to cause us to perish? I wish that we had been
content and lived beyond the Jordan!

<span id="an_7:8">7:8</span> Oh, Lord, what shall I say, after that
Israel has turned their backs before their enemies!

<span id="an_7:9">7:9</span> For the Canaanites and all the inhabitants
of the land will hear of it, and will surround us, and cut off our name
from the earth. What will you do for your great name?"

<span id="an_7:10">7:10</span> Yahweh said to Joshua, "Get up! Why are
you fallen on your face like that?

<span id="an_7:11">7:11</span> Israel has sinned. Yes, they have even
transgressed my covenant which I commanded them. Yes, they have even
taken of the devoted things, and have also stolen, and also deceived.
They have even put it among their own stuff.

<span id="an_7:12">7:12</span> Therefore the children of Israel can't
stand before their enemies. They turn their backs before their enemies,
because they have become devoted for destruction. I will not be with you
any more, unless you destroy the devoted things from among you.

<span id="an_7:13">7:13</span> "Get up! Sanctify the people, and say,
'Sanctify yourselves for tomorrow, for Yahweh, the God of Israel, says,
"There is a devoted thing in the midst of you, Israel. You cannot stand
before your enemies until you take away the devoted thing from among
you."

<span id="an_7:14">7:14</span> "'In the morning therefore you shall be
brought near by your tribes. It shall be that the tribe which Yahweh
selects shall come near by families. The family which Yahweh selects
shall come near by households. The household which Yahweh selects shall
come near man by man.

<span id="an_7:15">7:15</span> It shall be, that he who is taken with
the devoted thing shall be burnt with fire, he and all that he has,
because he has transgressed the covenant of Yahweh, and because he has
done a disgraceful thing in Israel.'"

<span id="an_7:16">7:16</span> So Joshua rose up early in the morning
and brought Israel near by their tribes. The tribe of Judah was
selected.

<span id="an_7:17">7:17</span> He brought near the family of Judah; and
he selected the family of the Zerahites. He brought near the family of
the Zerahites man by man, and Zabdi was selected.

<span id="an_7:18">7:18</span> He brought near his household man by man,
and Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the
tribe of Judah, was selected.

<span id="an_7:19">7:19</span> Joshua said to Achan, "My son, please
give glory to Yahweh, the God of Israel, and make confession to him.
Tell me now what you have done! Don't hide it from me!"

<span id="an_7:20">7:20</span> Achan answered Joshua, and said, "I have
truly sinned against Yahweh, the God of Israel, and this is what I have
done.

<span id="an_7:21">7:21</span> When I saw among the spoil a beautiful
Babylonian robe, two hundred shekels of silver, and a wedge of gold
weighing fifty shekels, then I coveted them and took them. Behold, they
are hidden in the ground in the middle of my tent, with the silver under
it."

<span id="an_7:22">7:22</span> So Joshua sent messengers, and they ran
to the tent. Behold, it was hidden in his tent, with the silver under
it.

<span id="an_7:23">7:23</span> They took them from the middle of the
tent, and brought them to Joshua and to all the children of Israel. They
laid them down before Yahweh.

<span id="an_7:24">7:24</span> Joshua, and all Israel with him, took
Achan the son of Zerah, the silver, the robe, the wedge of gold, his
sons, his daughters, his cattle, his donkeys, his sheep, his tent, and
all that he had; and they brought them up to the valley of Achor.

<span id="an_7:25">7:25</span> Joshua said, "Why have you troubled us?
Yahweh will trouble you this day." All Israel stoned him with stones,
and they burned them with fire and stoned them with stones.

<span id="an_7:26">7:26</span> They raised over him a great heap of
stones that remains to this day. Yahweh turned from the fierceness of
his anger. Therefore the name of that place was called "The valley of
Achor" to this day.

<span id="an_8:1">8:1</span> Yahweh said to Joshua, "Don't be afraid,
neither be dismayed. Take all the people of war with you, and arise, go
up to Ai. Behold, I have given into your hand the king of Ai, with his
people, his city, and his land.

<span id="an_8:2">8:2</span> You shall do to Ai and her king as you did
to Jericho and her king, except its spoil and its livestock, you shall
take for a plunder for yourselves. Set an ambush for the city behind
it."

<span id="an_8:3">8:3</span> So Joshua arose, and all the people of war,
to go up to Ai. Joshua chose thirty thousand men, the mighty men of
valor, and sent them out by night.

<span id="an_8:4">8:4</span> He commanded them, saying, "Behold, you
shall lie in ambush against the city, behind the city. Don't go very far
from the city, but all of you be ready.

<span id="an_8:5">8:5</span> I, and all the people who are with me, will
approach to the city. It shall happen, when they come out against us, as
at the first, that we will flee before them.

<span id="an_8:6">8:6</span> They will come out after us, until we have
drawn them away from the city; for they will say, 'They flee before us,
like the first time.' So we will flee before them,

<span id="an_8:7">8:7</span> and you shall rise up from the ambush, and
take possession of the city; for Yahweh your God will deliver it into
your hand.

<span id="an_8:8">8:8</span> It shall be, when you have seized on the
city, that you shall set the city on fire. You shall do this according
to the word of Yahweh. Behold, I have commanded you."

<span id="an_8:9">8:9</span> Joshua sent them out; and they went to set
up the ambush, and stayed between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of Ai;
but Joshua stayed among the people that night.

<span id="an_8:10">8:10</span> Joshua rose up early in the morning,
mustered the people, and went up, he and the elders of Israel, before
the people to Ai.

<span id="an_8:11">8:11</span> All the people, even the men of war who
were with him, went up, and drew near, and came before the city, and
encamped on the north side of Ai. Now there was a valley between him and
Ai.

<span id="an_8:12">8:12</span> He took about five thousand men, and set
them in ambush between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of the city.

<span id="an_8:13">8:13</span> So they set the people, even all the army
who was on the north of the city, and their ambush on the west of the
city; and Joshua went that night into the midst of the valley.

<span id="an_8:14">8:14</span> It happened, when the king of Ai saw it,
that they hurried and rose up early, and the men of the city went out
against Israel to battle, he and all his people, at the time appointed,
before the Arabah; but he didn't know that there was an ambush against
him behind the city.

<span id="an_8:15">8:15</span> Joshua and all Israel made as if they
were beaten before them, and fled by the way of the wilderness.

<span id="an_8:16">8:16</span> All the people who were in the city were
called together to pursue after them. They pursued Joshua, and were
drawn away from the city.

<span id="an_8:17">8:17</span> There was not a man left in Ai or Beth El
who didn't go out after Israel. They left the city open, and pursued
Israel.

<span id="an_8:18">8:18</span> Yahweh said to Joshua, "Stretch out the
javelin that is in your hand toward Ai, for I will give it into your
hand." Joshua stretched out the javelin that was in his hand toward the
city.

<span id="an_8:19">8:19</span> The ambush arose quickly out of their
place, and they ran as soon as he had stretched out his hand, and
entered into the city, and took it. They hurried and set the city on
fire.

<span id="an_8:20">8:20</span> When the men of Ai looked behind them,
they saw, and behold, the smoke of the city ascended up to heaven, and
they had no power to flee this way or that way. The people who fled to
the wilderness turned back on the pursuers.

<span id="an_8:21">8:21</span> When Joshua and all Israel saw that the
ambush had taken the city, and that the smoke of the city ascended, then
they turned again, and killed the men of Ai.

<span id="an_8:22">8:22</span> The others came out of the city against
them, so they were in the midst of Israel, some on this side, and some
on that side. They struck them, so that they let none of them remain or
escape.

<span id="an_8:23">8:23</span> They captured the king of Ai alive, and
brought him to Joshua.

<span id="an_8:24">8:24</span> It happened, when Israel had made an end
of killing all the inhabitants of Ai in the field, in the wilderness in
which they pursued them, and they had all fallen by the edge of the
sword, until they were consumed, that all Israel returned to Ai, and
struck it with the edge of the sword.

<span id="an_8:25">8:25</span> All that fell that day, both of men and
women, were twelve thousand, even all the men of Ai.

<span id="an_8:26">8:26</span> For Joshua didn't draw back his hand,
with which he stretched out the javelin, until he had utterly destroyed
all the inhabitants of Ai.

<span id="an_8:27">8:27</span> Only the livestock and the spoil of that
city Israel took for prey to themselves, according to the word of Yahweh
which he commanded Joshua.

<span id="an_8:28">8:28</span> So Joshua burnt Ai, and made it a heap
forever, even a desolation, to this day.

<span id="an_8:29">8:29</span> He hanged the king of Ai on a tree until
the evening, and at the sundown Joshua commanded, and they took his body
down from the tree, and threw it at the entrance of the gate of the
city, and raised a great heap of stones on it that remains to this day.

<span id="an_8:30">8:30</span> Then Joshua built an altar to Yahweh, the
God of Israel, in Mount Ebal,

<span id="an_8:31">8:31</span> as Moses the servant of Yahweh commanded
the children of Israel, as it is written in the book of the law of
Moses, an altar of uncut stones, on which no man had lifted up any iron.
They offered burnt offerings on it to Yahweh, and sacrificed peace
offerings.

<span id="an_8:32">8:32</span> He wrote there on the stones a copy of
the law of Moses, which he wrote in the presence of the children of
Israel.

<span id="an_8:33">8:33</span> All Israel, and their elders and
officers, and their judges, stood on this side of the ark and on that
side before the priests the Levites, who carried the ark of Yahweh's
covenant, the foreigner as well as the native; half of them in front of
Mount Gerizim, and half of them in front of Mount Ebal, as Moses the
servant of Yahweh had commanded at the first, that they should bless the
people of Israel.

<span id="an_8:34">8:34</span> Afterward he read all the words of the
law, the blessing and the curse, according to all that is written in the
book of the law.

<span id="an_8:35">8:35</span> There was not a word of all that Moses
commanded, which Joshua didn't read before all the assembly of Israel,
with the women, the little ones, and the foreigners who were among them.

<span id="an_9:1">9:1</span> It happened, when all the kings who were
beyond the Jordan, in the hill country, and in the lowland, and on all
the shore of the great sea in front of Lebanon, the Hittite, the
Amorite, the Canaanite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite,
heard of it

<span id="an_9:2">9:2</span> that they gathered themselves together to
fight with Joshua and with Israel, with one accord.

<span id="an_9:3">9:3</span> But when the inhabitants of Gibeon heard
what Joshua had done to Jericho and to Ai,

<span id="an_9:4">9:4</span> they also resorted to a ruse, and went and
made as if they had been ambassadors, and took old sacks on their
donkeys, and wineskins, old and torn and bound up,

<span id="an_9:5">9:5</span> and old and patched shoes on their feet,
and wore old garments. All the bread of their provision was dry and
moldy.

<span id="an_9:6">9:6</span> They went to Joshua to the camp at Gilgal,
and said to him, and to the men of Israel, "We have come from a far
country. Now therefore make a covenant with us."

<span id="an_9:7">9:7</span> The men of Israel said to the Hivites,
"What if you live among us. How could we make a covenant with you?"

<span id="an_9:8">9:8</span> They said to Joshua, "We are your
servants." Joshua said to them, "Who are you? Where do you come from?"

<span id="an_9:9">9:9</span> They said to him, "Your servants have come
from a very far country because of the name of Yahweh your God; for we
have heard of his fame, all that he did in Egypt,

<span id="an_9:10">9:10</span> and all that he did to the two kings of
the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan, to Sihon king of Heshbon and to
Og king of Bashan, who was at Ashtaroth.

<span id="an_9:11">9:11</span> Our elders and all the inhabitants of our
country spoke to us, saying, 'Take provision in your hand for the
journey, and go to meet them, and tell them, "We are your servants. Now
make a covenant with us."'

<span id="an_9:12">9:12</span> This our bread we took hot for our
provision out of our houses on the day we went out to go to you; but
now, behold, it is dry, and has become moldy.

<span id="an_9:13">9:13</span> These wineskins, which we filled, were
new; and behold, they are torn. These our garments and our shoes have
become old because of the very long journey."

<span id="an_9:14">9:14</span> The men sampled their provisions, and
didn't ask counsel from the mouth of Yahweh.

<span id="an_9:15">9:15</span> Joshua made peace with them, and made a
covenant with them, to let them live. The princes of the congregation
swore to them.

<span id="an_9:16">9:16</span> It happened at the end of three days
after they had made a covenant with them, that they heard that they were
their neighbors, and that they lived among them.

<span id="an_9:17">9:17</span> The children of Israel traveled and came
to their cities on the third day. Now their cities were Gibeon,
Chephirah, Beeroth, and Kiriath Jearim.

<span id="an_9:18">9:18</span> The children of Israel didn't strike
them, because the princes of the congregation had sworn to them by
Yahweh, the God of Israel. All the congregation murmured against the
princes.

<span id="an_9:19">9:19</span> But all the princes said to all the
congregation, "We have sworn to them by Yahweh, the God of Israel: now
therefore we may not touch them.

<span id="an_9:20">9:20</span> This we will do to them, and let them
live; lest wrath be on us, because of the oath which we swore to them."

<span id="an_9:21">9:21</span> The princes said to them, "Let them live,
so they became wood cutters and drawers of water for all the
congregation, as the princes had spoken to them."

<span id="an_9:22">9:22</span> Joshua called for them, and he spoke to
them, saying, "Why have you deceived us, saying, 'We are very far from
you,' when you live among us?

<span id="an_9:23">9:23</span> Now therefore you are cursed, and some of
you will never fail to be bondservants, both wood cutters and drawers of
water for the house of my God."

<span id="an_9:24">9:24</span> They answered Joshua, and said, "Because
your servants were certainly told how Yahweh your God commanded his
servant Moses to give you all the land, and to destroy all the
inhabitants of the land from before you. Therefore we were very afraid
for our lives because of you, and have done this thing.

<span id="an_9:25">9:25</span> Now, behold, we are in your hand. Do to
us as it seems good and right to you to do."

<span id="an_9:26">9:26</span> He did so to them, and delivered them out
of the hand of the children of Israel, so that they didn't kill them.

<span id="an_9:27">9:27</span> That day Joshua made them wood cutters
and drawers of water for the congregation and for the altar of Yahweh,
to this day, in the place which he should choose.

<span id="an_10:1">10:1</span> Now it happened when Adoni-Zedek king of
Jerusalem heard how Joshua had taken Ai, and had utterly destroyed it;
as he had done to Jericho and her king, so he had done to Ai and her
king; and how the inhabitants of Gibeon had made peace with Israel, and
were among them;

<span id="an_10:2">10:2</span> that they were very afraid, because
Gibeon was a great city, as one of the royal cities, and because it was
greater than Ai, and all its men were mighty.

<span id="an_10:3">10:3</span> Therefore Adoni-Zedek king of Jerusalem
sent to Hoham king of Hebron, to Piram king of Jarmuth, to Japhia king
of Lachish, and to Debir king of Eglon, saying,

<span id="an_10:4">10:4</span> "Come up to me, and help me, and let us
strike Gibeon; for it has made peace with Joshua and with the children
of Israel."

<span id="an_10:5">10:5</span> Therefore the five kings of the Amorites,
the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king
of Lachish, the king of Eglon, gathered themselves together, and went
up, they and all their armies, and encamped against Gibeon, and made war
against it.

<span id="an_10:6">10:6</span> The men of Gibeon sent to Joshua to the
camp to Gilgal, saying, "Don't abandon your servants! Come up to us
quickly, and save us, and help us; for all the kings of the Amorites
that dwell in the hill country have gathered together against us."

<span id="an_10:7">10:7</span> So Joshua went up from Gilgal, he, and
all the people of war with him, and all the mighty men of valor.

<span id="an_10:8">10:8</span> Yahweh said to Joshua, "Don't fear them,
for I have delivered them into your hands. Not a man of them will stand
before you."

<span id="an_10:9">10:9</span> Joshua therefore came on them suddenly.
He went up from Gilgal all night.

<span id="an_10:10">10:10</span> Yahweh confused them before Israel, and
he killed them with a great slaughter at Gibeon, and chased them by the
way of the ascent of Beth Horon, and struck them to Azekah and to
Makkedah.

<span id="an_10:11">10:11</span> It happened, as they fled from before
Israel, while they were at the descent of Beth Horon, that Yahweh cast
down great stones from the sky on them to Azekah, and they died. There
were more who died from the hailstones than who the children of Israel
killed with the sword.

<span id="an_10:12">10:12</span> Then Joshua spoke to Yahweh in the day
when Yahweh delivered up the Amorites before the children of Israel; and
he said in the sight of Israel, "Sun, stand still on Gibeon! You, moon,
stop in the valley of Aijalon!"

<span id="an_10:13">10:13</span> The sun stood still, and the moon
stayed, until the nation had avenged themselves of their enemies. Isn't
this written in the book of Jashar? The sun stayed in the midst of the
sky, and didn't hurry to go down about a whole day.

<span id="an_10:14">10:14</span> There was no day like that before it or
after it, that Yahweh listened to the voice of a man; for Yahweh fought
for Israel.

<span id="an_10:15">10:15</span> Joshua returned, and all Israel with
him, to the camp to Gilgal.

<span id="an_10:16">10:16</span> These five kings fled, and hid
themselves in the cave at Makkedah.

<span id="an_10:17">10:17</span> Joshua was told, saying, "The five
kings are found, hidden in the cave at Makkedah."

<span id="an_10:18">10:18</span> Joshua said, "Roll large stones to the
mouth of the cave, and set men by it to guard them;

<span id="an_10:19">10:19</span> but don't stay. Pursue your enemies,
and them from the rear. Don't allow them to enter into their cities; for
Yahweh your God has delivered them into your hand."

<span id="an_10:20">10:20</span> It happened, when Joshua and the
children of Israel had finished killing them with a very great slaughter
until they were consumed, and the remnant which remained of them had
entered into the fortified cities,

<span id="an_10:21">10:21</span> that all the people returned to the
camp to Joshua at Makkedah in peace. None moved his tongue against any
of the children of Israel.

<span id="an_10:22">10:22</span> Then Joshua said, "Open the mouth of
the cave, and bring those five kings out of the cave to me."

<span id="an_10:23">10:23</span> They did so, and brought those five
kings out of the cave to him: the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron,
the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, and the king of Eglon.

<span id="an_10:24">10:24</span> It happened, when they brought those
kings out to Joshua, that Joshua called for all the men of Israel, and
said to the chiefs of the men of war who went with him, "Come near, put
your feet on the necks of these kings." They came near, and put their
feet on their necks.

<span id="an_10:25">10:25</span> Joshua said to them, "Don't be afraid,
nor be dismayed. Be strong and courageous, for Yahweh will do this to
all your enemies against whom you fight."

<span id="an_10:26">10:26</span> Afterward Joshua struck them, put them
to death, and hanged them on five trees. They were hanging on the trees
until the evening.

<span id="an_10:27">10:27</span> It happened at the time of the going
down of the sun, that Joshua commanded, and they took them down off the
trees, and cast them into the cave in which they had hidden themselves,
and laid great stones on the mouth of the cave, which remain to this
very day.

<span id="an_10:28">10:28</span> Joshua took Makkedah on that day, and
struck it with the edge of the sword, with its king. He utterly
destroyed them and all the souls who were in it. He left none remaining.
He did to the king of Makkedah as he had done to the king of Jericho.

<span id="an_10:29">10:29</span> Joshua passed from Makkedah, and all
Israel with him, to Libnah, and fought against Libnah.

<span id="an_10:30">10:30</span> Yahweh delivered it also, with its
king, into the hand of Israel. He struck it with the edge of the sword,
and all the souls who were in it. He left none remaining in it. He did
to its king as he had done to the king of Jericho.

<span id="an_10:31">10:31</span> Joshua passed from Libnah, and all
Israel with him, to Lachish, and encamped against it, and fought against
it.

<span id="an_10:32">10:32</span> Yahweh delivered Lachish into the hand
of Israel. He took it on the second day, and struck it with the edge of
the sword, with all the souls who were in it, according to all that he
had done to Libnah.

<span id="an_10:33">10:33</span> Then Horam king of Gezer came up to
help Lachish; and Joshua struck him and his people, until he had left
him none remaining.

<span id="an_10:34">10:34</span> Joshua passed from Lachish, and all
Israel with him, to Eglon; and they encamped against it fought against
it.

<span id="an_10:35">10:35</span> They took it on that day, and struck it
with the edge of the sword. He utterly destroyed all the souls who were
in it that day, according to all that he had done to Lachish.

<span id="an_10:36">10:36</span> Joshua went up from Eglon, and all
Israel with him, to Hebron; and they fought against it.

<span id="an_10:37">10:37</span> They took it, and struck it with the
edge of the sword, with its king and all its cities, and all the souls
who were in it. He left none remaining, according to all that he had
done to Eglon; but he utterly destroyed it, and all the souls who were
in it.

<span id="an_10:38">10:38</span> Joshua returned, and all Israel with
him, to Debir, and fought against it.

<span id="an_10:39">10:39</span> He took it, with its king and all its
cities. They struck them with the edge of the sword, and utterly
destroyed all the souls who were in it. He left none remaining. As he
had done to Hebron, so he did to Debir, and to its king; as he had done
also to Libnah, and to its king.

<span id="an_10:40">10:40</span> So Joshua struck all the land, the hill
country, and the South, and the lowland, and the slopes, and all their
kings. He left none remaining, but he utterly destroyed all that
breathed, as Yahweh, the God of Israel, commanded.

<span id="an_10:41">10:41</span> Joshua struck them from Kadesh Barnea
even to Gaza, and all the country of Goshen, even to Gibeon.

<span id="an_10:42">10:42</span> Joshua took all these kings and their
land at one time, because Yahweh, the God of Israel, fought for Israel.

<span id="an_10:43">10:43</span> Joshua returned, and all Israel with
him, to the camp to Gilgal.

<span id="an_11:1">11:1</span> It happened, when Jabin king of Hazor
heard of it, that he sent to Jobab king of Madon, to the king of
Shimron, to the king of Achshaph,

<span id="an_11:2">11:2</span> and to the kings who were on the north,
in the hill country, in the Arabah south of Chinneroth, in the lowland,
and in the heights of Dor on the west,

<span id="an_11:3">11:3</span> to the Canaanite on the east and on the
west, and the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the
Jebusite in the hill country, and the Hivite under Hermon in the land of
Mizpah.

<span id="an_11:4">11:4</span> They went out, they and all their armies
with them, many people, even as the sand that is on the seashore in
multitude, with very many horses and chariots.

<span id="an_11:5">11:5</span> All these kings met together; and they
came and encamped together at the waters of Merom, to fight with Israel.

<span id="an_11:6">11:6</span> Yahweh said to Joshua, "Don't be afraid
because of them; for tomorrow at this time, I will deliver them up all
slain before Israel. You shall hamstring their horses and burn their
chariots with fire."

<span id="an_11:7">11:7</span> So Joshua came, and all the people of war
with him, against them by the waters of Merom suddenly, and fell on
them.

<span id="an_11:8">11:8</span> Yahweh delivered them into the hand of
Israel, and they struck them, and chased them to great Sidon, and to
Misrephoth Maim, and to the valley of Mizpeh eastward. They struck them
until they left them none remaining.

<span id="an_11:9">11:9</span> Joshua did to them as Yahweh told him. He
hamstrung their horses and burnt their chariots with fire.

<span id="an_11:10">11:10</span> Joshua turned back at that time, and
took Hazor, and struck its king with the sword: for Hazor used to be the
head of all those kingdoms.

<span id="an_11:11">11:11</span> They struck all the souls who were in
it with the edge of the sword, utterly destroying them. There was no one
left who breathed. He burnt Hazor with fire.

<span id="an_11:12">11:12</span> Joshua captured all the cities of those
kings, with their kings, and he struck them with the edge of the sword,
and utterly destroyed them; as Moses the servant of Yahweh commanded.

<span id="an_11:13">11:13</span> But as for the cities that stood on
their mounds, Israel burned none of them, except Hazor only. Joshua
burned that.

<span id="an_11:14">11:14</span> The children of Israel took all the
spoil of these cities, with the livestock, as spoils for themselves; but
every man they struck with the edge of the sword, until they had
destroyed them. They didn't leave any who breathed.

<span id="an_11:15">11:15</span> As Yahweh commanded Moses his servant,
so Moses commanded Joshua. Joshua did so. He left nothing undone of all
that Yahweh commanded Moses.

<span id="an_11:16">11:16</span> So Joshua captured all that land, the
hill country, all the South, all the land of Goshen, the lowland, the
Arabah, the hill country of Israel, and the lowland of the same;

<span id="an_11:17">11:17</span> from Mount Halak, that goes up to Seir,
even to Baal Gad in the valley of Lebanon under Mount Hermon. He took
all their kings, struck them, and put them to death.

<span id="an_11:18">11:18</span> Joshua made war a long time with all
those kings.

<span id="an_11:19">11:19</span> There was not a city that made peace
with the children of Israel, except the Hivites, the inhabitants of
Gibeon. They took all in battle.

<span id="an_11:20">11:20</span> For it was of Yahweh to harden their
hearts, to come against Israel in battle, that he might utterly destroy
them, that they might have no favor, but that he might destroy them, as
Yahweh commanded Moses.

<span id="an_11:21">11:21</span> Joshua came at that time, and cut off
the Anakim from the hill country, from Hebron, from Debir, from Anab,
and from all the hill country of Judah, and from all the hill country of
Israel: Joshua utterly destroyed them with their cities.

<span id="an_11:22">11:22</span> There were none of the Anakim left in
the land of the children of Israel. Only in Gaza, in Gath, and in
Ashdod, did some remain.

<span id="an_11:23">11:23</span> So Joshua took the whole land,
according to all that Yahweh spoke to Moses; and Joshua gave it for an
inheritance to Israel according to their divisions by their tribes. The
land had rest from war.

<span id="an_12:1">12:1</span> Now these are the kings of the land, whom
the children of Israel struck, and possessed their land beyond the
Jordan toward the sunrise, from the valley of the Arnon to Mount Hermon,
and all the Arabah eastward:

<span id="an_12:2">12:2</span> Sihon king of the Amorites, who lived in
Heshbon, and ruled from Aroer, which is on the edge of the valley of the
Arnon, and the middle of the valley, and half Gilead, even to the river
Jabbok, the border of the children of Ammon;

<span id="an_12:3">12:3</span> and the Arabah to the sea of Chinneroth,
eastward, and to the sea of the Arabah, even the Salt Sea, eastward, the
way to Beth Jeshimoth; and on the south, under the slopes of Pisgah:

<span id="an_12:4">12:4</span> and the border of Og king of Bashan, of
the remnant of the Rephaim, who lived at Ashtaroth and at Edrei,

<span id="an_12:5">12:5</span> and ruled in Mount Hermon, and in
Salecah, and in all Bashan, to the border of the Geshurites and the
Maacathites, and half Gilead, the border of Sihon king of Heshbon.

<span id="an_12:6">12:6</span> Moses the servant of Yahweh and the
children of Israel struck them. Moses the servant of Yahweh gave it for
a possession to the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half-tribe of
Manasseh.

<span id="an_12:7">12:7</span> These are the kings of the land whom
Joshua and the children of Israel struck beyond the Jordan westward,
from Baal Gad in the valley of Lebanon even to Mount Halak, that goes up
to Seir. Joshua gave it to the tribes of Israel for a possession
according to their divisions;

<span id="an_12:8">12:8</span> in the hill country, and in the lowland,
and in the Arabah, and in the slopes, and in the wilderness, and in the
South; the Hittite, the Amorite, and the Canaanite, the Perizzite, the
Hivite, and the Jebusite:

<span id="an_12:9">12:9</span> the king of Jericho, one; the king of Ai,
which is beside Bethel, one;

<span id="an_12:10">12:10</span> the king of Jerusalem, one; the king of
Hebron, one;

<span id="an_12:11">12:11</span> the king of Jarmuth, one; the king of
Lachish, one;

<span id="an_12:12">12:12</span> the king of Eglon, one; the king of
Gezer, one;

<span id="an_12:13">12:13</span> the king of Debir, one; the king of
Geder, one;

<span id="an_12:14">12:14</span> the king of Hormah, one; the king of
Arad, one;

<span id="an_12:15">12:15</span> the king of Libnah, one; the king of
Adullam, one;

<span id="an_12:16">12:16</span> the king of Makkedah, one; the king of
Bethel, one;

<span id="an_12:17">12:17</span> the king of Tappuah, one; the king of
Hepher, one;

<span id="an_12:18">12:18</span> the king of Aphek, one; the king of
Lassharon, one;

<span id="an_12:19">12:19</span> the king of Madon, one; the king of
Hazor, one;

<span id="an_12:20">12:20</span> the king of Shimron Meron, one; the
king of Achshaph, one;

<span id="an_12:21">12:21</span> the king of Taanach, one; the king of
Megiddo, one;

<span id="an_12:22">12:22</span> the king of Kedesh, one; the king of
Jokneam in Carmel, one;

<span id="an_12:23">12:23</span> the king of Dor in the height of Dor,
one; the king of Goiim in Gilgal, one;

<span id="an_12:24">12:24</span> the king of Tirzah, one: all the kings
thirty-one.

<span id="an_13:1">13:1</span> Now Joshua was old and well advanced in
years. Yahweh said to him, "You are old and advanced in years, and there
remains yet very much land to be possessed.

<span id="an_13:2">13:2</span> "This is the land that still remains: all
the regions of the Philistines, and all the Geshurites;

<span id="an_13:3">13:3</span> from the Shihor, which is before Egypt,
even to the border of Ekron northward, which is counted as Canaanite;
the five lords of the Philistines; the Gazites, and the Ashdodites, the
Ashkelonites, the Gittites, and the Ekronites; also the Avvim,

<span id="an_13:4">13:4</span> on the south; all the land of the
Canaanites, and Mearah that belongs to the Sidonians, to Aphek, to the
border of the Amorites;

<span id="an_13:5">13:5</span> and the land of the Gebalites, and all
Lebanon, toward the sunrise, from Baal Gad under Mount Hermon to the
entrance of Hamath;

<span id="an_13:6">13:6</span> all the inhabitants of the hill country
from Lebanon to Misrephoth Maim, even all the Sidonians; them will I
drive out from before the children of Israel: only allocate it to Israel
for an inheritance, as I have commanded you.

<span id="an_13:7">13:7</span> Now therefore divide this land for an
inheritance to the nine tribes and the half-tribe of Manasseh."

<span id="an_13:8">13:8</span> With him the Reubenites and the Gadites
received their inheritance, which Moses gave them, beyond the Jordan
eastward, even as Moses the servant of Yahweh gave them:

<span id="an_13:9">13:9</span> from Aroer, that is on the edge of the
valley of the Arnon, and the city that is in the middle of the valley,
and all the plain of Medeba to Dibon;

<span id="an_13:10">13:10</span> and all the cities of Sihon king of the
Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon, to the border of the children of
Ammon;

<span id="an_13:11">13:11</span> and Gilead, and the border of the
Geshurites and Maacathites, and all Mount Hermon, and all Bashan to
Salecah;

<span id="an_13:12">13:12</span> all the kingdom of Og in Bashan, who
reigned in Ashtaroth and in Edrei (the same was left of the remnant of
the Rephaim); for Moses attacked these, and drove them out.

<span id="an_13:13">13:13</span> Nevertheless the children of Israel
didn't drive out the Geshurites, nor the Maacathites: but Geshur and
Maacath dwell in the midst of Israel to this day.

<span id="an_13:14">13:14</span> Only he gave no inheritance to the
tribe of Levi. The offerings of Yahweh, the God of Israel, made by fire
are his inheritance, as he spoke to him.

<span id="an_13:15">13:15</span> Moses gave to the tribe of the children
of Reuben according to their families.

<span id="an_13:16">13:16</span> Their border was from Aroer, that is on
the edge of the valley of the Arnon, and the city that is in the middle
of the valley, and all the plain by Medeba;

<span id="an_13:17">13:17</span> Heshbon, and all its cities that are in
the plain; Dibon, Bamoth Baal, Beth Baal Meon,

<span id="an_13:18">13:18</span> Jahaz, Kedemoth, Mephaath,

<span id="an_13:19">13:19</span> Kiriathaim, Sibmah, Zereth Shahar in
the mount of the valley,

<span id="an_13:20">13:20</span> Beth Peor, the slopes of Pisgah, Beth
Jeshimoth,

<span id="an_13:21">13:21</span> all the cities of the plain, and all
the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon, whom
Moses struck with the chiefs of Midian, Evi, Rekem, Zur, Hur, and Reba,
the princes of Sihon, who lived in the land.

<span id="an_13:22">13:22</span> The children of Israel alse killed
Balaam also the son of Beor, the soothsayer, with the sword, among the
rest of their slain.

<span id="an_13:23">13:23</span> The border of the children of Reuben
was the bank of the Jordan. This was the inheritance of the children of
Reuben according to their families, the cities and its villages.

<span id="an_13:24">13:24</span> Moses gave to the tribe of Gad, to the
children of Gad, according to their families.

<span id="an_13:25">13:25</span> Their border was Jazer, and all the
cities of Gilead, and half the land of the children of Ammon, to Aroer
that is before Rabbah;

<span id="an_13:26">13:26</span> and from Heshbon to Ramath Mizpeh, and
Betonim; and from Mahanaim to the border of Debir;

<span id="an_13:27">13:27</span> and in the valley, Beth Haram, Beth
Nimrah, Succoth, and Zaphon, the rest of the kingdom of Sihon king of
Heshbon, the Jordan's bank, to the uttermost part of the sea of
Chinnereth beyond the Jordan eastward.

<span id="an_13:28">13:28</span> This is the inheritance of the children
of Gad according to their families, the cities and its villages.

<span id="an_13:29">13:29</span> Moses gave an inheritance to the
half-tribe of Manasseh. It was for the half-tribe of the children of
Manasseh according to their families.

<span id="an_13:30">13:30</span> Their border was from Mahanaim, all
Bashan, all the kingdom of Og king of Bashan, and all the towns of Jair,
which are in Bashan, sixty cities.

<span id="an_13:31">13:31</span> Half Gilead, Ashtaroth, and Edrei, the
cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan, were for the children of Machir
the son of Manasseh, even for the half of the children of Machir
according to their families.

<span id="an_13:32">13:32</span> These are the inheritances which Moses
distributed in the plains of Moab, beyond the Jordan at Jericho,
eastward.

<span id="an_13:33">13:33</span> But to the tribe of Levi Moses gave no
inheritance. Yahweh, the God of Israel, is their inheritance, as he
spoke to them.

<span id="an_14:1">14:1</span> These are the inheritances which the
children of Israel took in the land of Canaan, which Eleazar the priest,
Joshua the son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers' houses of the
tribes of the children of Israel, distributed to them,

<span id="an_14:2">14:2</span> by the lot of their inheritance, as
Yahweh commanded by Moses, for the nine tribes, and for the half-tribe.

<span id="an_14:3">14:3</span> For Moses had given the inheritance of
the two tribes and the half-tribe beyond the Jordan; but to the Levites
he gave no inheritance among them.

<span id="an_14:4">14:4</span> For the children of Joseph were two
tribes, Manasseh and Ephraim: and they gave no portion to the Levites in
the land, except cities to dwell in, with their suburbs for their
livestock and for their property.

<span id="an_14:5">14:5</span> The children of Israel did as Yahweh
commanded Moses, and they divided the land.

<span id="an_14:6">14:6</span> Then the children of Judah drew near to
Joshua in Gilgal. Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite said to him,
"You know the thing that Yahweh spoke to Moses the man of God concerning
me and concerning you in Kadesh Barnea.

<span id="an_14:7">14:7</span> I was forty years old when Moses the
servant of Yahweh sent me from Kadesh Barnea to spy out the land. I
brought him word again as it was in my heart.

<span id="an_14:8">14:8</span> Nevertheless, my brothers who went up
with me made the heart of the people melt; but I wholly followed Yahweh
my God.

<span id="an_14:9">14:9</span> Moses swore on that day, saying, 'Surely
the land where you walked shall be an inheritance to you and to your
children forever, because you have wholly followed Yahweh my God.'

<span id="an_14:10">14:10</span> "Now, behold, Yahweh has kept me alive,
as he spoke, these forty-five years, from the time that Yahweh spoke
this word to Moses, while Israel walked in the wilderness. Now, behold,
I am eighty-five years old, today.

<span id="an_14:11">14:11</span> As yet I am as strong today as I was in
the day that Moses sent me: as my strength was then, even so is my
strength now for war, to go out and to come in.

<span id="an_14:12">14:12</span> Now therefore give me this hill
country, of which Yahweh spoke in that day; for you heard in that day
how the Anakim were there, and great and fortified cities. It may be
that Yahweh will be with me, and I shall drive them out, as Yahweh
spoke."

<span id="an_14:13">14:13</span> Joshua blessed him; and he gave Hebron
to Caleb the son of Jephunneh for an inheritance.

<span id="an_14:14">14:14</span> Therefore Hebron became the inheritance
of Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite to this day; because he
wholly followed Yahweh, the God of Israel.

<span id="an_14:15">14:15</span> Now the name of Hebron before was
Kiriath Arba, after the greatest man among the Anakim. The land had rest
from war.

<span id="an_15:1">15:1</span> The lot for the tribe of the children of
Judah according to their families was to the border of Edom, even to the
wilderness of Zin southward, at the uttermost part of the south.

<span id="an_15:2">15:2</span> Their south border was from the uttermost
part of the Salt Sea, from the bay that looks southward;

<span id="an_15:3">15:3</span> and it went out southward of the ascent
of Akrabbim, and passed along to Zin, and went up by the south of Kadesh
Barnea, and passed along by Hezron, went up to Addar, and turned about
to Karka;

<span id="an_15:4">15:4</span> and it passed along to Azmon, went out at
the brook of Egypt; and the border ended at the sea. This shall be your
south border.

<span id="an_15:5">15:5</span> The east border was the Salt Sea, even to
the end of the Jordan. The border of the north quarter was from the bay
of the sea at the end of the Jordan.

<span id="an_15:6">15:6</span> The border went up to Beth Hoglah, and
passed along by the north of Beth Arabah; and the border went up to the
stone of Bohan the son of Reuben.

<span id="an_15:7">15:7</span> The border went up to Debir from the
valley of Achor, and so northward, looking toward Gilgal, that is over
against the ascent of Adummim, which is on the south side of the river.
The border passed along to the waters of En Shemesh, and ended at En
Rogel.

<span id="an_15:8">15:8</span> The border went up by the valley of the
son of Hinnom to the side of the Jebusite southward (the same is
Jerusalem); and the border went up to the top of the mountain that lies
before the valley of Hinnom westward, which is at the farthest part of
the valley of Rephaim northward.

<span id="an_15:9">15:9</span> The border extended from the top of the
mountain to the spring of the waters of Nephtoah, and went out to the
cities of Mount Ephron; and the border extended to Baalah (the same is
Kiriath Jearim);

<span id="an_15:10">15:10</span> and the border turned about from Baalah
westward to Mount Seir, and passed along to the side of Mount Jearim on
the north (the same is Chesalon), and went down to Beth Shemesh, and
passed along by Timnah;

<span id="an_15:11">15:11</span> and the border went out to the side of
Ekron northward; and the border extended to Shikkeron, and passed along
to Mount Baalah, and went out at Jabneel; and the goings out of the
border were at the sea.

<span id="an_15:12">15:12</span> The west border was to the shore of the
great sea. This is the border of the children of Judah according to
their families.

<span id="an_15:13">15:13</span> To Caleb the son of Jephunneh he gave a
portion among the children of Judah, according to the commandment of
Yahweh to Joshua, even Kiriath Arba, named after the father of Anak (the
same is Hebron).

<span id="an_15:14">15:14</span> Caleb drove out the three sons of Anak:
Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai, the children of Anak.

<span id="an_15:15">15:15</span> He went up against the inhabitants of
Debir: now the name of Debir before was Kiriath Sepher.

<span id="an_15:16">15:16</span> Caleb said, "He who strikes Kiriath
Sepher, and takes it, to him will I give Achsah my daughter as wife."

<span id="an_15:17">15:17</span> Othniel the son of Kenaz, the brother
of Caleb, took it: and he gave him Achsah his daughter as wife.

<span id="an_15:18">15:18</span> It happened, when she came, that she
had him ask her father fore a field. She got off of her donkey, and
Caleb said, "What do you want?"

<span id="an_15:19">15:19</span> She said, "Give me a blessing. Because
you have set me in the land of the South, give me also springs of
water." He gave her the upper springs and the lower springs.

<span id="an_15:20">15:20</span> This is the inheritance of the tribe of
the children of Judah according to their families.

<span id="an_15:21">15:21</span> The farthest cities of the tribe of the
children of Judah toward the border of Edom in the South were Kabzeel,
Eder, Jagur,

<span id="an_15:22">15:22</span> Kinah, Dimonah, Adadah,

<span id="an_15:57">15:57</span> Kain, Gibeah, and Timnah; ten cities
with their villages.

<span id="an_15:58">15:58</span> Halhul, Beth Zur, Gedor,

<span id="an_15:59">15:59</span> Maarath, Beth Anoth, and Eltekon; six
cities with their villages.

<span id="an_15:60">15:60</span> Kiriath Baal (the same is Kiriath
Jearim), and Rabbah; two cities with their villages.

<span id="an_15:61">15:61</span> In the wilderness, Beth Arabah, Middin,
Secacah,

<span id="an_15:62">15:62</span> Nibshan, the City of Salt, and En Gedi;
six cities with their villages.

<span id="an_15:63">15:63</span> As for the Jebusites, the inhabitants
of Jerusalem, the children of Judah couldn't drive them out; but the
Jebusites live with the children of Judah at Jerusalem to this day.

<span id="an_16:1">16:1</span> The lot came out for the children of
Joseph from the Jordan at Jericho, at the waters of Jericho on the east,
even the wilderness, going up from Jericho through the hill country to
Bethel.

<span id="an_16:2">16:2</span> It went out from Bethel to Luz, and
passed along to the border of the Archites to Ataroth;

<span id="an_16:3">16:3</span> and it went down westward to the border
of the Japhletites, to the border of Beth Horon the lower, even to
Gezer; and ended at the sea.

<span id="an_16:4">16:4</span> The children of Joseph, Manasseh and
Ephraim, took their inheritance.

<span id="an_16:5">16:5</span> This was the border of the children of
Ephraim according to their families. The border of their inheritance
eastward was Ataroth Addar, to Beth Horon the upper.

<span id="an_16:6">16:6</span> The border went out westward at
Michmethath on the north. The border turned about eastward to Taanath
Shiloh, and passed along it on the east of Janoah.

<span id="an_16:7">16:7</span> It went down from Janoah to Ataroth, to
Naarah, reached to Jericho, and went out at the Jordan.

<span id="an_16:8">16:8</span> From Tappuah the border went along
westward to the brook of Kanah; and ended at the sea. This is the
inheritance of the tribe of the children of Ephraim according to their
families;

<span id="an_16:9">16:9</span> together with the cities which were set
apart for the children of Ephraim in the midst of the inheritance of the
children of Manasseh, all the cities with their villages.

<span id="an_16:10">16:10</span> They didn't drive out the Canaanites
who lived in Gezer; but the Canaanites dwell in the midst of Ephraim to
this day, and have become servants to do forced labor.

<span id="an_17:1">17:1</span> This was the lot for the tribe of
Manasseh, for he was the firstborn of Joseph. As for Machir the
firstborn of Manasseh, the father of Gilead, because he was a man of
war, therefore he had Gilead and Bashan.

<span id="an_17:2">17:2</span> So this was for the rest of the children
of Manasseh according to their families: for the children of Abiezer,
for the children of Helek, for the children of Asriel, for the children
of Shechem, for the children of Hepher, and for the children of Shemida:
these were the male children of Manasseh the son of Joseph according to
their families.

<span id="an_17:3">17:3</span> But Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the
son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, had no sons, but
daughters: and these are the names of his daughters: Mahlah, Noah,
Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah.

<span id="an_17:4">17:4</span> They came near before Eleazar the priest,
and before Joshua the son of Nun, and before the princes, saying,
"Yahweh commanded Moses to give us an inheritance among our brothers."
Therefore according to the commandment of Yahweh he gave them an
inheritance among the brothers of their father.

<span id="an_17:5">17:5</span> Ten parts fell to Manasseh, besides the
land of Gilead and Bashan, which is beyond the Jordan;

<span id="an_17:6">17:6</span> because the daughters of Manasseh had an
inheritance among his sons. The land of Gilead belonged to the rest of
the sons of Manasseh.

<span id="an_17:7">17:7</span> The border of Manasseh was from Asher to
Michmethath, which is before Shechem. The border went along to the right
hand, to the inhabitants of En Tappuah.

<span id="an_17:8">17:8</span> The land of Tappuah belonged to Manasseh;
but Tappuah on the border of Manasseh belonged to the children of
Ephraim.

<span id="an_17:9">17:9</span> The border went down to the brook of
Kanah, southward of the brook. These cities belonged to Ephraim among
the cities of Manasseh. The border of Manasseh was on the north side of
the brook, and ended at the sea.

<span id="an_17:10">17:10</span> Southward it was Ephraim's, and
northward it was Manasseh's, and the sea was his border. They reached to
Asher on the north, and to Issachar on the east.

<span id="an_17:11">17:11</span> Manasseh had three heights in Issachar,
in Asher Beth Shean and its towns, and Ibleam and its towns, and the
inhabitants of Dor and its towns, and the inhabitants of Endor and its
towns, and the inhabitants of Taanach and its towns, and the inhabitants
of Megiddo and its towns.

<span id="an_17:12">17:12</span> Yet the children of Manasseh couldn't
drive out the inhabitants of those cities; but the Canaanites would
dwell in that land.

<span id="an_17:13">17:13</span> It happened, when the children of
Israel had grown strong, that they put the Canaanites to forced labor,
and didn't utterly drive them out.

<span id="an_17:14">17:14</span> The children of Joseph spoke to Joshua,
saying, "Why have you given me just one lot and one part for an
inheritance, since I am a great people, because Yahweh has blessed me so
far?"

<span id="an_17:15">17:15</span> Joshua said to them, "If you are a
great people, go up to the forest, and clear land for yourself there in
the land of the Perizzites and of the Rephaim; since the hill country of
Ephraim is too narrow for you."

<span id="an_17:16">17:16</span> The children of Joseph said, "The hill
country is not enough for us. All the Canaanites who dwell in the land
of the valley have chariots of iron, both those who are in Beth Shean
and its towns, and those who are in the valley of Jezreel."

<span id="an_17:17">17:17</span> Joshua spoke to the house of Joseph,
even to Ephraim and to Manasseh, saying, "You are a great people, and
have great power. You shall not have one lot only;

<span id="an_17:18">17:18</span> but the hill country shall be yours.
Although it is a forest, you shall cut it down, and it's farthest extent
shall be yours; for you shall drive out the Canaanites, though they have
chariots of iron, and though they are strong."

<span id="an_18:1">18:1</span> The whole congregation of the children of
Israel assembled themselves together at Shiloh, and set up the Tent of
Meeting there. The land was subdued before them.

<span id="an_18:2">18:2</span> Seven tribes remained among the children
of Israel, which had not yet divided their inheritance.

<span id="an_18:3">18:3</span> Joshua said to the children of Israel,
"How long will you neglect to go in to possess the land, which Yahweh,
the God of your fathers, has given you?

<span id="an_18:4">18:4</span> Appoint for yourselves three men from
each tribe. I will send them, and they shall arise, walk through the
land, and describe it according to their inheritance; and they shall
come to me.

<span id="an_18:5">18:5</span> They shall divide it into seven portions.
Judah shall live in his borders on the south, and the house of Joseph
shall live in their borders on the north.

<span id="an_18:6">18:6</span> You shall survey the land into seven
parts, and bring the description here to me; and I will cast lots for
you here before Yahweh our God.

<span id="an_18:7">18:7</span> For the Levites have no portion among
you; for the priesthood of Yahweh is their inheritance. Gad, Reuben, and
the half-tribe of Manasseh have received their inheritance beyond the
Jordan eastward, which Moses the servant of Yahweh gave them."

<span id="an_18:8">18:8</span> The men arose and went. Joshua commanded
those who went to survey the land, saying, "Go walk through the land,
survey it, and come again to me. I will cast lots for you here before
Yahweh in Shiloh."

<span id="an_18:9">18:9</span> The men went and passed through the land,
and surveyed it by cities into seven portions in a book. They came to
Joshua to the camp at Shiloh.

<span id="an_18:10">18:10</span> Joshua cast lots for them in Shiloh
before Yahweh. There Joshua divided the land to the children of Israel
according to their divisions.

<span id="an_18:11">18:11</span> The lot of the tribe of the children of
Benjamin came up according to their families. The border of their lot
went out between the children of Judah and the children of Joseph.

<span id="an_18:12">18:12</span> Their border on the north quarter was
from the Jordan. The border went up to the side of Jericho on the north,
and went up through the hill country westward. It ended at the
wilderness of Beth Aven.

<span id="an_18:13">18:13</span> The border passed along from there to
Luz, to the side of Luz (the same is Bethel), southward. The border went
down to Ataroth Addar, by the mountain that lies on the south of Beth
Horon the lower.

<span id="an_18:14">18:14</span> The border extended, and turned around
on the west quarter southward, from the mountain that lies before Beth
Horon southward; and ended at Kiriath Baal (the same is Kiriath Jearim),
a city of the children of Judah. This was the west quarter.

<span id="an_18:15">18:15</span> The south quarter was from the farthest
part of Kiriath Jearim. The border went out westward, and went out to
the spring of the waters of Nephtoah.

<span id="an_18:16">18:16</span> The border went down to the farthest
part of the mountain that lies before the valley of the son of Hinnom,
which is in the valley of Rephaim northward. It went down to the valley
of Hinnom, to the side of the Jebusite southward, and went down to En
Rogel.

<span id="an_18:17">18:17</span> It extended northward, went out at En
Shemesh, and went out to Geliloth, which is over against the ascent of
Adummim. It went down to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben.

<span id="an_18:18">18:18</span> It passed along to the side over
against the Arabah northward, and went down to the Arabah.

<span id="an_18:19">18:19</span> The border passed along to the side of
Beth Hoglah northward; and the border ended at the north bay of the Salt
Sea, at the south end of the Jordan. This was the south border.

<span id="an_18:20">18:20</span> The Jordan was its border on the east
quarter. This was the inheritance of the children of Benjamin, by the
borders around it, according to their families.

<span id="an_18:21">18:21</span> Now the cities of the tribe of the
children of Benjamin according to their families were Jericho, Beth
Hoglah, Emek Keziz,

<span id="an_18:22">18:22</span> Beth Arabah, Zemaraim, Bethel,

<span id="an_18:23">18:23</span> Avvim, Parah, Ophrah,

<span id="an_18:24">18:24</span> Chephar Ammoni, Ophni, and Geba; twelve
cities with their villages.

<span id="an_18:25">18:25</span> Gibeon, Ramah, Beeroth,

<span id="an_18:26">18:26</span> Mizpeh, Chephirah, Mozah,

<span id="an_18:27">18:27</span> Rekem, Irpeel, Taralah,

<span id="an_18:28">18:28</span> Zelah, Eleph, the Jebusite (the same is
Jerusalem), Gibeath, and Kiriath; fourteen cities with their villages.
This is the inheritance of the children of Benjamin according to their
families.

<span id="an_19:1">19:1</span> The second lot came out for Simeon, even
for the tribe of the children of Simeon according to their families.
Their inheritance was in the midst of the inheritance of the children of
Judah.

<span id="an_19:2">19:2</span> They had for their inheritance Beersheba
(or Sheba), Moladah,

<span id="an_19:3">19:3</span> Hazar Shual, Balah, Ezem,

<span id="an_19:4">19:4</span> Eltolad, Bethul, Hormah,

<span id="an_19:5">19:5</span> Ziklag, Beth Marcaboth, Hazar Susah,

<span id="an_19:6">19:6</span> Beth Lebaoth, and Sharuhen; thirteen
cities with their villages;

<span id="an_19:7">19:7</span> Ain, Rimmon, Ether, and Ashan; four
cities with their villages;

<span id="an_19:8">19:8</span> and all the villages that were around
these cities to Baalath Beer, Ramah of the South. This is the
inheritance of the tribe of the children of Simeon according to their
families.

<span id="an_19:9">19:9</span> Out of the part of the children of Judah
was the inheritance of the children of Simeon; for the portion of the
children of Judah was too much for them. Therefore the children of
Simeon had inheritance in the midst of their inheritance.

<span id="an_19:10">19:10</span> The third lot came up for the children
of Zebulun according to their families. The border of their inheritance
was to Sarid.

<span id="an_19:11">19:11</span> Their border went up westward, even to
Maralah, and reached to Dabbesheth. It reached to the brook that is
before Jokneam.

<span id="an_19:12">19:12</span> It turned from Sarid eastward toward
the sunrise to the border of Chisloth Tabor. It went out to Daberath,
and went up to Japhia.

<span id="an_19:13">19:13</span> From there it passed along eastward to
Gath Hepher, to Ethkazin; and it went out at Rimmon which stretches to
Neah.

<span id="an_19:14">19:14</span> The border turned around it on the
north to Hannathon; and it ended at the valley of Iphtah El;

<span id="an_19:15">19:15</span> Kattath, Nahalal, Shimron, Idalah, and
Bethlehem: twelve cities with their villages.

<span id="an_19:16">19:16</span> This is the inheritance of the children
of Zebulun according to their families, these cities with their
villages.

<span id="an_19:17">19:17</span> The fourth lot came out for Issachar,
even for the children of Issachar according to their families.

<span id="an_19:18">19:18</span> Their border was to Jezreel,
Chesulloth, Shunem,

<span id="an_19:19">19:19</span> Hapharaim, Shion, Anaharath,

<span id="an_19:20">19:20</span> Rabbith, Kishion, Ebez,

<span id="an_19:21">19:21</span> Remeth, Engannim, En Haddah, and Beth
Pazzez.

<span id="an_19:22">19:22</span> The border reached to Tabor,
Shahazumah, and Beth Shemesh. Their border ended at the Jordan: sixteen
cities with their villages.

<span id="an_19:23">19:23</span> This is the inheritance of the tribe of
the children of Issachar according to their families, the cities with
their villages.

<span id="an_19:24">19:24</span> The fifth lot came out for the tribe of
the children of Asher according to their families.

<span id="an_19:25">19:25</span> Their border was Helkath, Hali, Beten,
Achshaph,

<span id="an_19:26">19:26</span> Allammelech, Amad, Mishal. It reached
to Carmel westward, and to Shihorlibnath.

<span id="an_19:27">19:27</span> It turned toward the sunrise to Beth
Dagon, and reached to Zebulun, and to the valley of Iphtah El northward
to Beth Emek and Neiel. It went out to Cabul on the left hand,

<span id="an_19:28">19:28</span> and Ebron, Rehob, Hammon, and Kanah,
even to great Sidon.

<span id="an_19:29">19:29</span> The border turned to Ramah, to the
fortified city of Tyre; and the border turned to Hosah. It ended at the
sea by the region of Achzib;

<span id="an_19:30">19:30</span> Ummah also, and Aphek, and Rehob:
twenty-two cities with their villages.

<span id="an_19:31">19:31</span> This is the inheritance of the tribe of
the children of Asher according to their families, these cities with
their villages.

<span id="an_19:32">19:32</span> The sixth lot came out for the children
of Naphtali, even for the children of Naphtali according to their
families.

<span id="an_19:33">19:33</span> Their border was from Heleph, from the
oak in Zaanannim, Adaminekeb, and Jabneel, to Lakkum. It ended at the
Jordan.

<span id="an_19:34">19:34</span> The border turned westward to Aznoth
Tabor, and went out from there to Hukkok. It reached to Zebulun on the
south, and reached to Asher on the west, and to Judah at the Jordan
toward the sunrise.

<span id="an_19:35">19:35</span> The fortified cities were Ziddim, Zer,
Hammath, Rakkath, Chinnereth,

<span id="an_19:36">19:36</span> Adamah, Ramah, Hazor,

<span id="an_19:37">19:37</span> Kedesh, Edrei, En Hazor,

<span id="an_19:38">19:38</span> Iron, Migdal El, Horem, Beth Anath, and
Beth Shemesh; nineteen cities with their villages.

<span id="an_19:39">19:39</span> This is the inheritance of the tribe of
the children of Naphtali according to their families, the cities with
their villages.

<span id="an_19:40">19:40</span> The seventh lot came out for the tribe
of the children of Dan according to their families.

<span id="an_19:41">19:41</span> The border of their inheritance was
Zorah, Eshtaol, Irshemesh,

<span id="an_19:42">19:42</span> Shaalabbin, Aijalon, Ithlah,

<span id="an_19:43">19:43</span> Elon, Timnah, Ekron,

<span id="an_19:44">19:44</span> Eltekeh, Gibbethon, Baalath,

<span id="an_19:45">19:45</span> Jehud, Bene Berak, Gath Rimmon,

<span id="an_19:46">19:46</span> Me Jarkon, and Rakkon, with the border
over against Joppa.

<span id="an_19:47">19:47</span> The border of the children of Dan went
out beyond them; for the children of Dan went up and fought against
Leshem, and took it, and struck it with the edge of the sword, and
possessed it, and lived therein, and called Leshem, Dan, after the name
of Dan their father.

<span id="an_19:48">19:48</span> This is the inheritance of the tribe of
the children of Dan according to their families, these cities with their
villages.

<span id="an_19:49">19:49</span> So they made an end of distributing the
land for inheritance by its borders. The children of Israel gave an
inheritance to Joshua the son of Nun in the midst of them.

<span id="an_19:50">19:50</span> According to the commandment of Yahweh,
they gave him the city which he asked, even Timnathserah in the hill
country of Ephraim; and he built the city, and lived there.

<span id="an_19:51">19:51</span> These are the inheritances, which
Eleazar the priest, Joshua the son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers'
houses of the tribes of the children of Israel, distributed for
inheritance by lot in Shiloh before Yahweh, at the door of the Tent of
Meeting. So they made an end of dividing the land.

<span id="an_20:1">20:1</span> Yahweh spoke to Joshua, saying,

<span id="an_20:2">20:2</span> "Speak to the children of Israel, saying,
'Assign the cities of refuge, of which I spoke to you by Moses,

<span id="an_20:3">20:3</span> that the manslayer who kills any person
accidentally or unintentionally may flee there. They shall be to you for
a refuge from the avenger of blood.

<span id="an_20:4">20:4</span> He shall flee to one of those cities, and
shall stand at the entrance of the gate of the city, and declare his
cause in the ears of the elders of that city. They shall take him into
the city with them, and give him a place, that he may live among them.

<span id="an_20:5">20:5</span> If the avenger of blood pursue after him,
then they shall not deliver up the manslayer into his hand; because he
struck his neighbor unintentionally, and didn't hate him before.

<span id="an_20:6">20:6</span> He shall dwell in that city until he
stands before the congregation for judgment, until the death of the high
priest that shall be in those days. Then the manslayer shall return, and
come to his own city, and to his own house, to the city he fled from.'"

<span id="an_20:7">20:7</span> They set apart Kedesh in Galilee in the
hill country of Naphtali, Shechem in the hill country of Ephraim, and
Kiriath Arba (the same is Hebron) in the hill country of Judah.

<span id="an_20:8">20:8</span> Beyond the Jordan at Jericho eastward,
they assigned Bezer in the wilderness in the plain out of the tribe of
Reuben, Ramoth in Gilead out of the tribe of Gad, and Golan in Bashan
out of the tribe of Manasseh.

<span id="an_20:9">20:9</span> These were the appointed cities for all
the children of Israel, and for the alien who lives among them, that
whoever kills any person unintentionally might flee there, and not die
by the hand of the avenger of blood, until he stands before the
congregation.

<span id="an_21:1">21:1</span> Then the heads of fathers' houses of the
Levites came near to Eleazar the priest, and to Joshua the son of Nun,
and to the heads of fathers' houses of the tribes of the children of
Israel.

<span id="an_21:2">21:2</span> They spoke to them at Shiloh in the land
of Canaan, saying, "Yahweh commanded Moses to give us cities to dwell
in, with their suburbs for our livestock."

<span id="an_21:3">21:3</span> The children of Israel gave to the
Levites out of their inheritance, according to the commandment of
Yahweh, these cities with their suburbs.

<span id="an_21:4">21:4</span> The lot came out for the families of the
Kohathites. The children of Aaron the priest, who were of the Levites,
had thirteen cities by lot out of the tribe of Judah, out of the tribe
of the Simeonites, and out of the tribe of Benjamin.

<span id="an_21:5">21:5</span> The rest of the children of Kohath had
ten cities by lot out of the families of the tribe of Ephraim, out of
the tribe of Dan, and out of the half-tribe of Manasseh.

<span id="an_21:6">21:6</span> The children of Gershon had thirteen
cities by lot out of the families of the tribe of Issachar, out of the
tribe of Asher, out of the tribe of Naphtali, and out of the half-tribe
of Manasseh in Bashan.

<span id="an_21:7">21:7</span> The children of Merari according to their
families had twelve cities out of the tribe of Reuben, out of the tribe
of Gad, and out of the tribe of Zebulun.

<span id="an_21:8">21:8</span> The children of Israel gave these cities
with their suburbs by lot to the Levites, as Yahweh commanded by Moses.

<span id="an_21:9">21:9</span> They gave out of the tribe of the
children of Judah, and out of the tribe of the children of Simeon, these
cities which are mentioned by name:

<span id="an_21:10">21:10</span> and they were for the children of
Aaron, of the families of the Kohathites, who were of the children of
Levi; for theirs was the first lot.

<span id="an_21:11">21:11</span> They gave them Kiriath Arba, named
after the father of Anak (the same is Hebron), in the hill country of
Judah, with its suburbs around it.

<span id="an_21:12">21:12</span> But they gave the fields of the city
and its villages to Caleb the son of Jephunneh for his possession.

<span id="an_21:13">21:13</span> To the children of Aaron the priest
they gave Hebron with its suburbs, the city of refuge for the manslayer,
Libnah with its suburbs,

<span id="an_21:14">21:14</span> Jattir with its suburbs, Eshtemoa with
its suburbs,

<span id="an_21:15">21:15</span> Holon with its suburbs, Debir with its
suburbs,

<span id="an_21:16">21:16</span> Ain with its suburbs, Juttah with its
suburbs, and Beth Shemesh with its suburbs; nine cities out of those two
tribes.

<span id="an_21:17">21:17</span> Out of the tribe of Benjamin, Gibeon
with its suburbs, Geba with its suburbs,

<span id="an_21:18">21:18</span> Anathoth with its suburbs, and Almon
with its suburbs; four cities.

<span id="an_21:19">21:19</span> All the cities of the children of
Aaron, the priests, were thirteen cities with their suburbs.

<span id="an_21:20">21:20</span> The families of the children of Kohath,
the Levites, even the rest of the children of Kohath, had the cities of
their lot out of the tribe of Ephraim.

<span id="an_21:21">21:21</span> They gave them Shechem with its suburbs
in the hill country of Ephraim, the city of refuge for the manslayer,
and Gezer with its suburbs,

<span id="an_21:22">21:22</span> Kibzaim with its suburbs, and Beth
Horon with its suburbs; four cities.

<span id="an_21:23">21:23</span> Out of the tribe of Dan, Elteke with
its suburbs, Gibbethon with its suburbs,

<span id="an_21:24">21:24</span> Aijalon with its suburbs, Gath Rimmon
with its suburbs; four cities.

<span id="an_21:25">21:25</span> Out of the half-tribe of Manasseh,
Taanach with its suburbs, and Gath Rimmon with its suburbs; two cities.

<span id="an_21:26">21:26</span> All the cities of the families of the
rest of the children of Kohath were ten with their suburbs.

<span id="an_21:27">21:27</span> They gave to the children of Gershon,
of the families of the Levites, out of the half-tribe of Manasseh Golan
in Bashan with its suburbs, the city of refuge for the manslayer, and Be
Eshterah with its suburbs; two cities.

<span id="an_21:28">21:28</span> Out of the tribe of Issachar, Kishion
with its suburbs, Daberath with its suburbs,

<span id="an_21:29">21:29</span> Jarmuth with its suburbs, En Gannim
with its suburbs; four cities.

<span id="an_21:30">21:30</span> Out of the tribe of Asher, Mishal with
its suburbs, Abdon with its suburbs,

<span id="an_21:31">21:31</span> Helkath with its suburbs, and Rehob
with its suburbs; four cities.

<span id="an_21:32">21:32</span> Out of the tribe of Naphtali, Kedesh in
Galilee with its suburbs, the city of refuge for the manslayer,
Hammothdor with its suburbs, and Kartan with its suburbs; three cities.

<span id="an_21:33">21:33</span> All the cities of the Gershonites
according to their families were thirteen cities with their suburbs.

<span id="an_21:34">21:34</span> To the families of the children of
Merari, the rest of the Levites, out of the tribe of Zebulun, Jokneam
with its suburbs, Kartah with its suburbs,

<span id="an_21:35">21:35</span> Dimnah with its suburbs, and Nahalal
with its suburbs; four cities.

<span id="an_21:36">21:36</span> Out of the tribe of Reuben, Bezer with
its suburbs, Jahaz with its suburbs,

<span id="an_21:37">21:37</span> Kedemoth with its suburbs, and Mephaath
with its suburbs; four cities.

<span id="an_21:38">21:38</span> Out of the tribe of Gad, Ramoth in
Gilead with its suburbs, the city of refuge for the manslayer, and
Mahanaim with its suburbs,

<span id="an_21:39">21:39</span> Heshbon with its suburbs, Jazer with
its suburbs; four cities in all.

<span id="an_21:40">21:40</span> All these were the cities of the
children of Merari according to their families, even the rest of the
families of the Levites. Their lot was twelve cities.

<span id="an_21:41">21:41</span> All the cities of the Levites in the
midst of the possession of the children of Israel were forty-eight
cities with their suburbs.

<span id="an_21:42">21:42</span> Each of these cities included their
suburbs around them. It was this way with all these cities.

<span id="an_21:43">21:43</span> So Yahweh gave to Israel all the land
which he swore to give to their fathers. They possessed it, and lived in
it.

<span id="an_21:44">21:44</span> Yahweh gave them rest all around,
according to all that he swore to their fathers. Not a man of all their
enemies stood before them. Yahweh delivered all their enemies into their
hand.

<span id="an_21:45">21:45</span> Nothing failed of any good thing which
Yahweh had spoken to the house of Israel. All came to pass.

<span id="an_22:1">22:1</span> Then Joshua called the Reubenites, the
Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh,

<span id="an_22:2">22:2</span> and said to them, "You have kept all that
Moses the servant of Yahweh commanded you, and have listened to my voice
in all that I commanded you.

<span id="an_22:3">22:3</span> You have not left your brothers these
many days to this day, but have performed the duty of the commandment of
Yahweh your God.

<span id="an_22:4">22:4</span> Now Yahweh your God has given rest to
your brothers, as he spoke to them. Therefore now return and go to your
tents, to the land of your possession, which Moses the servant of Yahweh
gave you beyond the Jordan.

<span id="an_22:5">22:5</span> Only take diligent heed to do the
commandment and the law which Moses the servant of Yahweh commanded you,
to love Yahweh your God, to walk in all his ways, to keep his
commandments, to hold fast to him, and to serve him with all your heart
and with all your soul."

<span id="an_22:6">22:6</span> So Joshua blessed them, and sent them
away; and they went to their tents.

<span id="an_22:7">22:7</span> Now to the one half-tribe of Manasseh
Moses had given inheritance in Bashan; but to the other half gave Joshua
among their brothers beyond the Jordan westward. Moreover when Joshua
sent them away to their tents, he blessed them,

<span id="an_22:8">22:8</span> and spoke to them, saying, "Return with
much wealth to your tents, with very much livestock, with silver, with
gold, with brass, with iron, and with very much clothing. Divide the
spoil of your enemies with your brothers."

<span id="an_22:9">22:9</span> The children of Reuben and the children
of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh returned, and departed from the
children of Israel out of Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan, to go
to the land of Gilead, to the land of their possession, which they
owned, according to the commandment of Yahweh by Moses.

<span id="an_22:10">22:10</span> When they came to the region about the
Jordan, that is in the land of Canaan, the children of Reuben and the
children of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh built there an altar by
the Jordan, a great altar to look at.

<span id="an_22:11">22:11</span> The children of Israel heard this,
"Behold, the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the
half-tribe of Manasseh have built an altar in the forefront of the land
of Canaan, in the region about the Jordan, on the side that pertains to
the children of Israel."

<span id="an_22:12">22:12</span> When the children of Israel heard of
it, the whole congregation of the children of Israel gathered themselves
together at Shiloh, to go up against them to war.

<span id="an_22:13">22:13</span> The children of Israel sent to the
children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the half-tribe of
Manasseh, into the land of Gilead, Phinehas the son of Eleazar the
priest,

<span id="an_22:14">22:14</span> and with him ten princes, one prince of
a fathers' house for each of the tribes of Israel; and they were
everyone of them head of their fathers' houses among the thousands of
Israel.

<span id="an_22:15">22:15</span> They came to the children of Reuben,
and to the children of Gad, and to the half-tribe of Manasseh, to the
land of Gilead, and they spoke with them, saying,

<span id="an_22:16">22:16</span> "Thus says the whole congregation of
Yahweh, 'What trespass is this that you have committed against the God
of Israel, to turn away this day from following Yahweh, in that you have
built you an altar, to rebel this day against Yahweh?

<span id="an_22:17">22:17</span> Is the iniquity of Peor too little for
us, from which we have not cleansed ourselves to this day, although
there came a plague on the congregation of Yahweh,

<span id="an_22:18">22:18</span> that you must turn away this day from
following Yahweh? It will be, since you rebel today against Yahweh, that
tomorrow he will be angry with the whole congregation of Israel.

<span id="an_22:19">22:19</span> However, if the land of your possession
is unclean, then pass over to the land of the possession of Yahweh, in
which Yahweh's tabernacle dwells, and take possession among us; but
don't rebel against Yahweh, nor rebel against us, in building an altar
other than the altar of Yahweh our God.

<span id="an_22:20">22:20</span> Didn't Achan the son of Zerah commit a
trespass in the devoted thing, and wrath fell on all the congregation of
Israel? That man didn't perish alone in his iniquity.'"

<span id="an_22:21">22:21</span> Then the children of Reuben and the
children of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh answered, and spoke to
the heads of the thousands of Israel,

<span id="an_22:22">22:22</span> "The Mighty One, God, Yahweh, the
Mighty One, God, Yahweh, he knows; and Israel shall know: if it was in
rebellion, or if in trespass against Yahweh (don't save us this day),

<span id="an_22:23">22:23</span> that we have built us an altar to turn
away from following Yahweh; or if to offer burnt offering or meal
offering, or if to offer sacrifices of peace offerings, let Yahweh
himself require it.

<span id="an_22:24">22:24</span> "If we have not out of concern done
this, and for a reason, saying, 'In time to come your children might
speak to our children, saying, "What have you to do with Yahweh, the God
of Israel?

<span id="an_22:25">22:25</span> For Yahweh has made the Jordan a border
between us and you, you children of Reuben and children of Gad. You have
no portion in Yahweh."' So your children might make our children cease
from fearing Yahweh.

<span id="an_22:26">22:26</span> "Therefore we said, 'Let's now prepare
to build ourselves an altar, not for burnt offering, nor for sacrifice;

<span id="an_22:27">22:27</span> but it will be a witness between us and
you, and between our generations after us, that we may perform the
service of Yahweh before him with our burnt offerings, with our
sacrifices, and with our peace offerings;' that your children may not
tell our children in time to come, 'You have no portion in Yahweh.'

<span id="an_22:28">22:28</span> "Therefore we said, 'It shall be, when
they tell us or our generations this in time to come, that we shall say,
"Behold the pattern of the altar of Yahweh, which our fathers made, not
for burnt offering, nor for sacrifice; but it is a witness between us
and you."'

<span id="an_22:29">22:29</span> "Far be it from us that we should rebel
against Yahweh, and turn away this day from following Yahweh, to build
an altar for burnt offering, for meal offering, or for sacrifice,
besides the altar of Yahweh our God that is before his tabernacle!"

<span id="an_22:30">22:30</span> When Phinehas the priest, and the
princes of the congregation, even the heads of the thousands of Israel
that were with him, heard the words that the children of Reuben and the
children of Gad and the children of Manasseh spoke, it pleased them
well.

<span id="an_22:31">22:31</span> Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest
said to the children of Reuben, to the children of Gad, and to the
children of Manasseh, "Today we know that Yahweh is in the midst of us,
because you have not committed this trespass against Yahweh. Now you
have delivered the children of Israel out of the hand of Yahweh."

<span id="an_22:32">22:32</span> Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest,
and the princes, returned from the children of Reuben, and from the
children of Gad, out of the land of Gilead, to the land of Canaan, to
the children of Israel, and brought them word again.

<span id="an_22:33">22:33</span> The thing pleased the children of
Israel; and the children of Israel blessed God, and spoke no more of
going up against them to war, to destroy the land in which the children
of Reuben and the children of Gad lived.

<span id="an_22:34">22:34</span> The children of Reuben and the children
of Gad named the altar "A Witness Between Us that Yahweh is God."

<span id="an_23:1">23:1</span> It happened after many days, when Yahweh
had given rest to Israel from their enemies all around, and Joshua was
old and well advanced in years,

<span id="an_23:2">23:2</span> that Joshua called for all Israel, for
their elders and for their heads, and for their judges and for their
officers, and said to them, "I am old and well advanced in years.

<span id="an_23:3">23:3</span> You have seen all that Yahweh your God
has done to all these nations because of you; for it is Yahweh your God
who has fought for you.

<span id="an_23:4">23:4</span> Behold, I have allotted to you these
nations that remain, to be an inheritance for your tribes, from the
Jordan, with all the nations that I have cut off, even to the great sea
toward the going down of the sun.

<span id="an_23:5">23:5</span> Yahweh your God will thrust them out from
before you, and drive them from out of your sight. You shall possess
their land, as Yahweh your God spoke to you.

<span id="an_23:6">23:6</span> "Therefore be very courageous to keep and
to do all that is written in the book of the law of Moses, that you not
turn aside from it to the right hand or to the left;

<span id="an_23:7">23:7</span> that you not come among these nations,
these that remain among you; neither make mention of the name of their
gods, nor cause to swear by them, neither serve them, nor bow down
yourselves to them;

<span id="an_23:8">23:8</span> but hold fast to Yahweh your God, as you
have done to this day.

<span id="an_23:9">23:9</span> "For Yahweh has driven great and strong
nations out from before you. But as for you, no man has stood before you
to this day.

<span id="an_23:10">23:10</span> One man of you shall chase a thousand;
for it is Yahweh your God who fights for you, as he spoke to you.

<span id="an_23:11">23:11</span> Take good heed therefore to yourselves,
that you love Yahweh your God.

<span id="an_23:12">23:12</span> "But if you do at all go back, and hold
fast to the remnant of these nations, even these who remain among you,
and make marriages with them, and go in to them, and they to you;

<span id="an_23:13">23:13</span> know for a certainty that Yahweh your
God will no longer drive these nations from out of your sight; but they
shall be a snare and a trap to you, a scourge in your sides, and thorns
in your eyes, until you perish from off this good land which Yahweh your
God has given you.

<span id="an_23:14">23:14</span> "Behold, today I am going the way of
all the earth. You know in all your hearts and in all your souls that
not one thing has failed of all the good things which Yahweh your God
spoke concerning you. All have happened to you. Not one thing has failed
of it.

<span id="an_23:15">23:15</span> It shall happen that as all the good
things have come on you of which Yahweh your God spoke to you, so Yahweh
will bring on you all the evil things, until he has destroyed you from
off this good land which Yahweh your God has given you,

<span id="an_23:16">23:16</span> when you disobey the covenant of Yahweh
your God, which he commanded you, and go and serve other gods, and bow
down yourselves to them. Then the anger of Yahweh will be kindled
against you, and you will perish quickly from off the good land which he
has given to you."

<span id="an_24:1">24:1</span> Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel
to Shechem, and called for the elders of Israel, for their heads, for
their judges, and for their officers; and they presented themselves
before God.

<span id="an_24:2">24:2</span> Joshua said to all the people, "Thus says
Yahweh, the God of Israel, 'Your fathers lived of old time beyond the
River, even Terah, the father of Abraham, and the father of Nahor: and
they served other gods.

<span id="an_24:3">24:3</span> I took your father Abraham from beyond
the River, and led him throughout all the land of Canaan, and multiplied
his seed, and gave him Isaac.

<span id="an_24:4">24:4</span> I gave to Isaac Jacob and Esau: and I
gave to Esau Mount Seir, to possess it. Jacob and his children went down
into Egypt.

<span id="an_24:5">24:5</span> "'I sent Moses and Aaron, and I plagued
Egypt, according to that which I did in its midst: and afterward I
brought you out.

<span id="an_24:6">24:6</span> I brought your fathers out of Egypt: and
you came to the sea. The Egyptians pursued after your fathers with
chariots and with horsemen to the Red Sea.

<span id="an_24:7">24:7</span> When they cried out to Yahweh, he put
darkness between you and the Egyptians, and brought the sea on them, and
covered them; and your eyes saw what I did in Egypt: and you lived in
the wilderness many days.

<span id="an_24:8">24:8</span> "'I brought you into the land of the
Amorites, that lived beyond the Jordan: and they fought with you; and I
gave them into your hand. You possessed their land; and I destroyed them
from before you.

<span id="an_24:9">24:9</span> Then Balak the son of Zippor, king of
Moab, arose and fought against Israel. He sent and called Balaam the son
of Beor to curse you;

<span id="an_24:10">24:10</span> but I would not listen to Balaam;
therefore he blessed you still. So I delivered you out of his hand.

<span id="an_24:11">24:11</span> "'You went over the Jordan, and came to
Jericho. The men of Jericho fought against you, the Amorite, the
Perizzite, the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Girgashite, the Hivite, and
the Jebusite; and I delivered them into your hand.

<span id="an_24:12">24:12</span> I sent the hornet before you, which
drove them out from before you, even the two kings of the Amorites; not
with your sword, nor with your bow.

<span id="an_24:13">24:13</span> I gave you a land whereon you had not
labored, and cities which you didn't build, and you live in them. You
eat of vineyards and olive groves which you didn't plant.'

<span id="an_24:14">24:14</span> "Now therefore fear Yahweh, and serve
him in sincerity and in truth. Put away the gods which your fathers
served beyond the River, in Egypt; and serve Yahweh.

<span id="an_24:15">24:15</span> If it seems evil to you to serve
Yahweh, choose this day whom you will serve; whether the gods which your
fathers served that were beyond the River, or the gods of the Amorites,
in whose land you dwell: but as for me and my house, we will serve
Yahweh."

<span id="an_24:16">24:16</span> The people answered, "Far be it from us
that we should forsake Yahweh, to serve other gods;

<span id="an_24:17">24:17</span> for it is Yahweh our God who brought us
and our fathers up out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage,
and who did those great signs in our sight, and preserved us in all the
way in which we went, and among all the peoples through the midst of
whom we passed.

<span id="an_24:18">24:18</span> Yahweh drove out from before us all the
peoples, even the Amorites who lived in the land. Therefore we also will
serve Yahweh; for he is our God."

<span id="an_24:19">24:19</span> Joshua said to the people, "You can't
serve Yahweh; for he is a holy God. He is a jealous God. He will not
forgive your disobedience nor your sins.

<span id="an_24:20">24:20</span> If you forsake Yahweh, and serve
foreign gods, then he will turn and do you evil, and consume you, after
he has done you good."

<span id="an_24:21">24:21</span> The people said to Joshua, "No; but we
will serve Yahweh."

<span id="an_24:22">24:22</span> Joshua said to the people, "You are
witnesses against yourselves that you have chosen Yahweh yourselves, to
serve him." They said, "We are witnesses."

<span id="an_24:23">24:23</span> "Now therefore put away the foreign
gods which are among you, and incline your heart to Yahweh, the God of
Israel."

<span id="an_24:24">24:24</span> The people said to Joshua, "We will
serve Yahweh our God, and we will listen to his voice."

<span id="an_24:25">24:25</span> So Joshua made a covenant with the
people that day, and made for them a statute and an ordinance in
Shechem.

<span id="an_24:26">24:26</span> Joshua wrote these words in the book of
the law of God; and he took a great stone, and set it up there under the
oak that was by the sanctuary of Yahweh.

<span id="an_24:27">24:27</span> Joshua said to all the people, "Behold,
this stone shall be a witness against us; for it has heard all the words
of Yahweh which he spoke to us. It shall be therefore a witness against
you, lest you deny your God."

<span id="an_24:28">24:28</span> So Joshua sent the people away, every
man to his inheritance.

<span id="an_24:29">24:29</span> It happened after these things, that
Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of Yahweh, died, being one hundred
and ten years old.

<span id="an_24:30">24:30</span> They buried him in the border of his
inheritance in Timnathserah, which is in the hill country of Ephraim, on
the north of the mountain of Gaash.

<span id="an_24:31">24:31</span> Israel served Yahweh all the days of
Joshua, and all the days of the elders who outlived Joshua, and had
known all the work of Yahweh, that he had worked for Israel.

<span id="an_24:32">24:32</span> They buried the bones of Joseph, which
the children of Israel brought up out of Egypt, in Shechem, in the
parcel of ground which Jacob bought of the sons of Hamor the father of
Shechem for a hundred pieces of money. They became the inheritance of
the children of Joseph.

<span id="an_24:33">24:33</span> Eleazar the son of Aaron died. They
buried him in the hill of Phinehas his son, which was given him in the
hill country of Ephraim.
