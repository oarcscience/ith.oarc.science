### World English Bible: 2 Kings

<span id="an_1:1">1:1</span> Moab rebelled against Israel after the
death of Ahab.

<span id="an_1:2">1:2</span> Ahaziah fell down through the lattice in
his upper room that was in Samaria, and was sick. So he sent messengers,
and said to them, "Go, inquire of Baal Zebub, the god of Ekron, whether
I will recover of this sickness."

<span id="an_1:3">1:3</span> But the angel of Yahweh said to Elijah the
Tishbite, "Arise, go up to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria,
and tell them, 'Is it because there is no God in Israel, that you go to
inquire of Baal Zebub, the god of Ekron?

<span id="an_1:4">1:4</span> Now therefore thus says Yahweh, "You shall
not come down from the bed where you have gone up, but shall surely
die."'" Elijah departed.

<span id="an_1:5">1:5</span> The messengers returned to him, and he said
to them, "Why is it that you have returned?"

<span id="an_1:6">1:6</span> They said to him, "A man came up to meet
us, and said to us, 'Go, return to the king who sent you, and tell him,
"Thus says Yahweh, 'Is it because there is no God in Israel, that you
send to inquire of Baal Zebub, the god of Ekron? Therefore you shall not
come down from the bed where you have gone up, but shall surely die.'"'"

<span id="an_1:7">1:7</span> He said to them, "What kind of man was he
who came up to meet you, and told you these words?"

<span id="an_1:8">1:8</span> They answered him, "He was a hairy man, and
wearing a leather belt around his waist." He said, "It is Elijah the
Tishbite."

<span id="an_1:9">1:9</span> Then \[the king\] sent a captain of fifty
with his fifty to him. He went up to him; and behold, he was sitting on
the top of the hill. He said to him, "Man of God, the king has said,
'Come down!'"

<span id="an_1:10">1:10</span> Elijah answered to the captain of fifty,
"If I am a man of God, let fire come down from the sky, and consume you
and your fifty!" Fire came down from the sky, and consumed him and his
fifty.

<span id="an_1:11">1:11</span> Again he sent to him another captain of
fifty and his fifty. He answered him, "Man of God, the king has said,
'Come down quickly!'"

<span id="an_1:12">1:12</span> Elijah answered them, "If I am a man of
God, let fire come down from the sky, and consume you and your fifty!"
The fire of God came down from the sky, and consumed him and his fifty.

<span id="an_1:13">1:13</span> Again he sent the captain of a third
fifty with his fifty. The third captain of fifty went up, and came and
fell on his knees before Elijah, and begged him, and said to him, "Man
of God, please let my life, and the life of these fifty your servants,
be precious in your sight.

<span id="an_1:14">1:14</span> Behold, fire came down from the sky, and
consumed the two former captains of fifty with their fifties. But now
let my life be precious in your sight."

<span id="an_1:15">1:15</span> The angel of Yahweh said to Elijah, "Go
down with him. Don't be afraid of him." He arose, and went down with him
to the king.

<span id="an_1:16">1:16</span> He said to him, "Thus says Yahweh,
'Because you have sent messengers to inquire of Baal Zebub, the god of
Ekron, is it because there is no God in Israel to inquire of his word?
Therefore you shall not come down from the bed where you have gone up,
but shall surely die.'"

<span id="an_1:17">1:17</span> So he died according to the word of
Yahweh which Elijah had spoken. Jehoram began to reign in his place in
the second year of Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah; because
he had no son.

<span id="an_1:18">1:18</span> Now the rest of the acts of Ahaziah which
he did, aren't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings
of Israel?

<span id="an_2:1">2:1</span> It happened, when Yahweh would take up
Elijah by a whirlwind into heaven, that Elijah went with Elisha from
Gilgal.

<span id="an_2:2">2:2</span> Elijah said to Elisha, "Please wait here,
for Yahweh has sent me as far as Bethel." Elisha said, "As Yahweh lives,
and as your soul lives, I will not leave you." So they went down to
Bethel.

<span id="an_2:3">2:3</span> The sons of the prophets who were at Bethel
came out to Elisha, and said to him, "Do you know that Yahweh will take
away your master from your head today?" He said, "Yes, I know it; hold
your peace."

<span id="an_2:4">2:4</span> Elijah said to him, "Elisha, please wait
here, for Yahweh has sent me to Jericho." He said, "As Yahweh lives, and
as your soul lives, I will not leave you." So they came to Jericho.

<span id="an_2:5">2:5</span> The sons of the prophets who were at
Jericho came near to Elisha, and said to him, "Do you know that Yahweh
will take away your master from your head today?" He answered, "Yes, I
know it. Hold your peace."

<span id="an_2:6">2:6</span> Elijah said to him, "Please wait here, for
Yahweh has sent me to the Jordan." He said, "As Yahweh lives, and as
your soul lives, I will not leave you." They both went on.

<span id="an_2:7">2:7</span> Fifty men of the sons of the prophets went,
and stood opposite them at a distance; and they both stood by the
Jordan.

<span id="an_2:8">2:8</span> Elijah took his mantle, and wrapped it
together, and struck the waters, and they were divided here and there,
so that they two went over on dry ground.

<span id="an_2:9">2:9</span> It happened, when they had gone over, that
Elijah said to Elisha, "Ask what I shall do for you, before I am taken
from you." Elisha said, "Please let a double portion of your spirit be
on me."

<span id="an_2:10">2:10</span> He said, "You have asked a hard thing. If
you see me when I am taken from you, it shall be so for you; but if not,
it shall not be so."

<span id="an_2:11">2:11</span> It happened, as they still went on, and
talked, that behold, a chariot of fire and horses of fire separated
them; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven.

<span id="an_2:12">2:12</span> Elisha saw it, and he cried, "My father,
my father, the chariots of Israel and its horsemen!" He saw him no more:
and he took hold of his own clothes, and tore them in two pieces.

<span id="an_2:13">2:13</span> He took up also the mantle of Elijah that
fell from him, and went back, and stood by the bank of the Jordan.

<span id="an_2:14">2:14</span> He took the mantle of Elijah that fell
from him, and struck the waters, and said, "Where is Yahweh, the God of
Elijah?" When he also had struck the waters, they were divided here and
there; and Elisha went over.

<span id="an_2:15">2:15</span> When the sons of the prophets who were at
Jericho over against him saw him, they said, "The spirit of Elijah rests
on Elisha." They came to meet him, and bowed themselves to the ground
before him.

<span id="an_2:16">2:16</span> They said to him, "See now, there are
with your servants fifty strong men. Please let them go and seek your
master. Perhaps the Spirit of Yahweh has taken him up, and put him on
some mountain, or into some valley. He said, "You shall not send them."

<span id="an_2:17">2:17</span> When they urged him until he was ashamed,
he said, "Send them." They sent therefore fifty men; and they searched
for three days, but didn't find him.

<span id="an_2:18">2:18</span> They came back to him, while he stayed at
Jericho; and he said to them, "Didn't I tell you, 'Don't go?'"

<span id="an_2:19">2:19</span> The men of the city said to Elisha,
"Behold, please, the situation of this city is pleasant, as my lord
sees; but the water is bad, and the land miscarries."

<span id="an_2:20">2:20</span> He said, "Bring me a new jar, and put
salt in it." They brought it to him.

<span id="an_2:21">2:21</span> He went out to the spring of the waters,
and threw salt into it, and said, "Thus says Yahweh, 'I have healed
these waters. There shall not be from there any more death or
miscarrying.'"

<span id="an_2:22">2:22</span> So the waters were healed to this day,
according to the word of Elisha which he spoke.

<span id="an_2:23">2:23</span> He went up from there to Bethel. As he
was going up by the way, some youths came out of the city and mocked
him, and said to him, "Go up, you baldy! Go up, you baldhead!"

<span id="an_2:24">2:24</span> He looked behind him and saw them, and
cursed them in the name of Yahweh. Two female bears came out of the
woods, and mauled forty-two of those youths.

<span id="an_2:25">2:25</span> He went from there to Mount Carmel, and
from there he returned to Samaria.

<span id="an_3:1">3:1</span> Now Jehoram the son of Ahab began to reign
over Israel in Samaria in the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat king of
Judah, and reigned twelve years.

<span id="an_3:2">3:2</span> He did that which was evil in the sight of
Yahweh, but not like his father, and like his mother; for he put away
the pillar of Baal that his father had made.

<span id="an_3:3">3:3</span> Nevertheless he held to the sins of
Jeroboam the son of Nebat, with which he made Israel to sin; he didn't
depart from it.

<span id="an_3:4">3:4</span> Now Mesha king of Moab was a sheep breeder;
and he rendered to the king of Israel the wool of one hundred thousand
lambs, and of one hundred thousand rams.

<span id="an_3:5">3:5</span> But it happened, when Ahab was dead, that
the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel.

<span id="an_3:6">3:6</span> King Jehoram went out of Samaria at that
time, and mustered all Israel.

<span id="an_3:7">3:7</span> He went and sent to Jehoshaphat the king of
Judah, saying, "The king of Moab has rebelled against me. Will you go
with me against Moab to battle?" He said, "I will go up. I am as you
are, my people as your people, my horses as your horses."

<span id="an_3:8">3:8</span> He said, "Which way shall we go up?" He
answered, "The way of the wilderness of Edom."

<span id="an_3:9">3:9</span> So the king of Israel went, and the king of
Judah, and the king of Edom; and they made a circuit of seven days'
journey. There was no water for the army, nor for the animals that
followed them.

<span id="an_3:10">3:10</span> The king of Israel said, "Alas! For
Yahweh has called these three kings together to deliver them into the
hand of Moab."

<span id="an_3:11">3:11</span> But Jehoshaphat said, "Isn't there here a
prophet of Yahweh, that we may inquire of Yahweh by him?" One of the
king of Israel's servants answered, "Elisha the son of Shaphat is here,
who poured water on the hands of Elijah."

<span id="an_3:12">3:12</span> Jehoshaphat said, "The word of Yahweh is
with him." So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom
went down to him.

<span id="an_3:13">3:13</span> Elisha said to the king of Israel, "What
have I to do with you? Go to the prophets of your father, and to the
prophets of your mother." The king of Israel said to him, "No; for
Yahweh has called these three kings together to deliver them into the
hand of Moab."

<span id="an_3:14">3:14</span> Elisha said, "As Yahweh of Armies lives,
before whom I stand, surely, were it not that I respect the presence of
Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, I would not look toward you, nor see you.

<span id="an_3:15">3:15</span> But now bring me a minstrel." It
happened, when the minstrel played, that the hand of Yahweh came on him.

<span id="an_3:16">3:16</span> He said, "Thus says Yahweh, 'Make this
valley full of trenches.'

<span id="an_3:17">3:17</span> For thus says Yahweh, 'You will not see
wind, neither will you see rain; yet that valley shall be filled with
water, and you will drink, both you and your livestock and your animals.

<span id="an_3:18">3:18</span> This is but a light thing in the sight of
Yahweh. He will also deliver the Moabites into your hand.

<span id="an_3:19">3:19</span> You shall strike every fortified city,
and every choice city, and shall fell every good tree, and stop all
springs of water, and mar every good piece of land with stones.'"

<span id="an_3:20">3:20</span> It happened in the morning, about the
time of offering the offering, that behold, water came by the way of
Edom, and the country was filled with water.

<span id="an_3:21">3:21</span> Now when all the Moabites heard that the
kings had come up to fight against them, they gathered themselves
together, all who were able to put on armor, and upward, and stood on
the border.

<span id="an_3:22">3:22</span> They rose up early in the morning, and
the sun shone on the water, and the Moabites saw the water over against
them as red as blood.

<span id="an_3:23">3:23</span> They said, "This is blood. The kings are
surely destroyed, and they have struck each other. Now therefore, Moab,
to the spoil!"

<span id="an_3:24">3:24</span> When they came to the camp of Israel, the
Israelites rose up and struck the Moabites, so that they fled before
them; and they went forward into the land smiting the Moabites.

<span id="an_3:25">3:25</span> They beat down the cities; and on every
good piece of land they cast every man his stone, and filled it; and
they stopped all the springs of water, and felled all the good trees,
until in Kir Hareseth \[only\] they left its stones; however the men
armed with slings went about it, and struck it.

<span id="an_3:26">3:26</span> When the king of Moab saw that the battle
was too severe for him, he took with him seven hundred men who drew
sword, to break through to the king of Edom; but they could not.

<span id="an_3:27">3:27</span> Then he took his eldest son who would
have reigned in his place, and offered him for a burnt offering on the
wall. There was great wrath against Israel: and they departed from him,
and returned to their own land.

<span id="an_4:1">4:1</span> Now there cried a certain woman of the
wives of the sons of the prophets to Elisha, saying, "Your servant my
husband is dead. You know that your servant feared Yahweh. Now the
creditor has come to take for himself my two children to be slaves."

<span id="an_4:2">4:2</span> Elisha said to her, "What shall I do for
you? Tell me: what do you have in the house?" She said, "Your handmaid
has nothing in the house, except a pot of oil."

<span id="an_4:3">4:3</span> Then he said, "Go, borrow containers from
of all your neighbors, even empty containers. Don't borrow just a few.

<span id="an_4:4">4:4</span> You shall go in, and shut the door on you
and on your sons, and pour out into all those containers; and you shall
set aside that which is full."

<span id="an_4:5">4:5</span> So she went from him, and shut the door on
her and on her sons; they brought the containers to her, and she poured
out.

<span id="an_4:6">4:6</span> It happened, when the containers were full,
that she said to her son, "Bring me another container." He said to her,
"There isn't another container." The oil stopped flowing.

<span id="an_4:7">4:7</span> Then she came and told the man of God. He
said, "Go, sell the oil, and pay your debt; and you and your sons live
on the rest."

<span id="an_4:8">4:8</span> It fell on a day, that Elisha passed to
Shunem, where there was a prominent woman; and she persuaded him to eat
bread. So it was, that as often as he passed by, he turned in there to
eat bread.

<span id="an_4:9">4:9</span> She said to her husband, "See now, I
perceive that this is a holy man of God, that passes by us continually.

<span id="an_4:10">4:10</span> Please let us make a little room on the
wall. Let us set for him there a bed, a table, a chair, and a lamp
stand. It shall be, when he comes to us, that he shall turn in there."

<span id="an_4:11">4:11</span> One day he came there, and he turned into
the room and lay there.

<span id="an_4:12">4:12</span> He said to Gehazi his servant, "Call this
Shunammite." When he had called her, she stood before him.

<span id="an_4:13">4:13</span> He said to him, "Say now to her, 'Behold,
you have cared for us with all this care. What is to be done for you?
Would you like to be spoken for to the king, or to the captain of the
army?'" She answered, "I dwell among my own people."

<span id="an_4:14">4:14</span> He said, "What then is to be done for
her?" Gehazi answered, "Most certainly she has no son, and her husband
is old."

<span id="an_4:15">4:15</span> He said, "Call her." When he had called
her, she stood in the door.

<span id="an_4:16">4:16</span> He said, "At this season, when the time
comes around, you will embrace a son." She said, "No, my lord, you man
of God, do not lie to your handmaid."

<span id="an_4:17">4:17</span> The woman conceived, and bore a son at
that season, when the time came around, as Elisha had said to her.

<span id="an_4:18">4:18</span> When the child was grown, it happened one
day that he went out to his father to the reapers.

<span id="an_4:19">4:19</span> He said to his father, "My head! My
head!" He said to his servant, "Carry him to his mother."

<span id="an_4:20">4:20</span> When he had taken him, and brought him to
his mother, he sat on her knees until noon, and then died.

<span id="an_4:21">4:21</span> She went up and laid him on the bed of
the man of God, and shut the door on him, and went out.

<span id="an_4:22">4:22</span> She called to her husband, and said,
"Please send me one of the servants, and one of the donkeys, that I may
run to the man of God, and come again."

<span id="an_4:23">4:23</span> He said, "Why would you want go to him
today? It is neither new moon nor Sabbath." She said, "It's alright."

<span id="an_4:24">4:24</span> Then she saddled a donkey, and said to
her servant, "Drive, and go forward! Don't slow down for me, unless I
ask you to."

<span id="an_4:25">4:25</span> So she went, and came to the man of God
to Mount Carmel. It happened, when the man of God saw her afar off, that
he said to Gehazi his servant, "Behold, there is the Shunammite.

<span id="an_4:26">4:26</span> Please run now to meet her, and ask her,
'Is it well with you? Is it well with your husband? Is it well with the
child?'" She answered, "It is well."

<span id="an_4:27">4:27</span> When she came to the man of God to the
hill, she caught hold of his feet. Gehazi came near to thrust her away;
but the man of God said, "Leave her alone; for her soul is troubled
within her; and Yahweh has hidden it from me, and has not told me."

<span id="an_4:28">4:28</span> Then she said, "Did I desire a son of my
lord? Didn't I say, Do not deceive me?"

<span id="an_4:29">4:29</span> Then he said to Gehazi, "Tuck your cloak
into your belt, take my staff in your hand, and go your way. If you meet
any man, don't greet him; and if anyone greets you, don't answer him
again. Then lay my staff on the face of the child."

<span id="an_4:30">4:30</span> The mother of the child said, "As Yahweh
lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave you." He arose, and
followed her.

<span id="an_4:31">4:31</span> Gehazi passed on before them, and laid
the staff on the face of the child; but there was neither voice, nor
hearing. Therefore he returned to meet him, and told him, saying, "The
child has not awakened."

<span id="an_4:32">4:32</span> When Elisha had come into the house,
behold, the child was dead, and laid on his bed.

<span id="an_4:33">4:33</span> He went in therefore, and shut the door
on them both, and prayed to Yahweh.

<span id="an_4:34">4:34</span> He went up, and lay on the child, and put
his mouth on his mouth, and his eyes on his eyes, and his hands on his
hands. He stretched himself on him; and the flesh of the child grew
warm.

<span id="an_4:35">4:35</span> Then he returned, and walked in the house
once back and forth; and went up, and stretched himself on him. Then the
child sneezed seven times, and the child opened his eyes.

<span id="an_4:36">4:36</span> He called Gehazi, and said, "Call this
Shunammite!" So he called her. When she had come in to him, he said,
"Take up your son."

<span id="an_4:37">4:37</span> Then she went in, and fell at his feet,
and bowed herself to the ground; and she took up her son, and went out.

<span id="an_4:38">4:38</span> Elisha came again to Gilgal. There was a
famine in the land; and the sons of the prophets were sitting before
him; and he said to his servant, "Set on the great pot, and boil stew
for the sons of the prophets."

<span id="an_4:39">4:39</span> One went out into the field to gather
herbs, and found a wild vine, and gathered of it wild gourds his lap
full, and came and shred them into the pot of stew; for they didn't
recognize them.

<span id="an_4:40">4:40</span> So they poured out for the men to eat. It
happened, as they were eating of the stew, that they cried out, and
said, "Man of God, there is death in the pot!" They could not eat of it.

<span id="an_4:41">4:41</span> But he said, "Then bring meal." He cast
it into the pot; and he said, "Pour out for the people, that they may
eat." There was no harm in the pot.

<span id="an_4:42">4:42</span> A man from Baal Shalishah came, and
brought the man of God bread of the first fruits, twenty loaves of
barley, and fresh ears of grain in his sack. He said, "Give to the
people, that they may eat."

<span id="an_4:43">4:43</span> His servant said, "What, should I set
this before a hundred men?" But he said, "Give the people, that they may
eat; for thus says Yahweh, 'They will eat, and will have some left
over.'"

<span id="an_4:44">4:44</span> So he set it before them, and they ate,
and left some of it, according to the word of Yahweh.

<span id="an_5:1">5:1</span> Now Naaman, captain of the army of the king
of Syria, was a great man with his master, and honorable, because by him
Yahweh had given victory to Syria: he was also a mighty man of valor,
\[but he was\] a leper.

<span id="an_5:2">5:2</span> The Syrians had gone out in bands, and had
brought away captive out of the land of Israel a little maiden; and she
waited on Naaman's wife.

<span id="an_5:3">5:3</span> She said to her mistress, "I wish that my
lord were with the prophet who is in Samaria! Then he would heal him of
his leprosy."

<span id="an_5:4">5:4</span> Someone went in, and told his lord, saying,
"The maiden who is from the land of Israel said this."

<span id="an_5:5">5:5</span> The king of Syria said, "Go now, and I will
send a letter to the king of Israel." He departed, and took with him ten
talents of silver, and six thousand pieces of gold, and ten changes of
clothing.

<span id="an_5:6">5:6</span> He brought the letter to the king of
Israel, saying, "Now when this letter has come to you, behold, I have
sent Naaman my servant to you, that you may heal him of his leprosy."

<span id="an_5:7">5:7</span> It happened, when the king of Israel had
read the letter, that he tore his clothes, and said, "Am I God, to kill
and to make alive, that this man sends to me to heal a man of his
leprosy? But please consider and see how he seeks a quarrel against me."

<span id="an_5:8">5:8</span> It was so, when Elisha the man of God heard
that the king of Israel had torn his clothes, that he sent to the king,
saying, "Why have you torn your clothes? Let him come now to me, and he
shall know that there is a prophet in Israel."

<span id="an_5:9">5:9</span> So Naaman came with his horses and with his
chariots, and stood at the door of the house of Elisha.

<span id="an_5:10">5:10</span> Elisha sent a messenger to him, saying,
"Go and wash in the Jordan seven times, and your flesh shall come again
to you, and you shall be clean."

<span id="an_5:11">5:11</span> But Naaman was angry, and went away, and
said, "Behold, I thought, 'He will surely come out to me, and stand, and
call on the name of Yahweh his God, and wave his hand over the place,
and heal the leper.'

<span id="an_5:12">5:12</span> Aren't Abanah and Pharpar, the rivers of
Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? Couldn't I wash in them,
and be clean?" So he turned and went away in a rage.

<span id="an_5:13">5:13</span> His servants came near, and spoke to him,
and said, "My father, if the prophet had asked you do some great thing,
wouldn't you have done it? How much rather then, when he says to you,
'Wash, and be clean?'"

<span id="an_5:14">5:14</span> Then went he down, and dipped \[himself\]
seven times in the Jordan, according to the saying of the man of God;
and his flesh was restored like the flesh of a little child, and he was
clean.

<span id="an_5:15">5:15</span> He returned to the man of God, he and all
his company, and came, and stood before him; and he said, "See now, I
know that there is no God in all the earth, but in Israel. Now
therefore, please take a gift from your servant."

<span id="an_5:16">5:16</span> But he said, "As Yahweh lives, before
whom I stand, I will receive none." He urged him to take it; but he
refused.

<span id="an_5:17">5:17</span> Naaman said, "If not, then, please let
there be given to your servant two mules' burden of earth; for your
servant will from now on offer neither burnt offering nor sacrifice to
other gods, but to Yahweh.

<span id="an_5:18">5:18</span> In this thing may Yahweh pardon your
servan: when my master goes into the house of Rimmon to worship there,
and he leans on my hand, and I bow myself in the house of Rimmon. When I
bow myself in the house of Rimmon, may Yahweh pardon your servant in
this thing."

<span id="an_5:19">5:19</span> He said to him, "Go in peace." So he
departed from him a little way.

<span id="an_5:20">5:20</span> But Gehazi the servant of Elisha the man
of God, said, "Behold, my master has spared this Naaman the Syrian, in
not receiving at his hands that which he brought. As Yahweh lives, I
will run after him, and take something from him."

<span id="an_5:21">5:21</span> So Gehazi followed after Naaman. When
Naaman saw one running after him, he came down from the chariot to meet
him, and said, "Is all well?"

<span id="an_5:22">5:22</span> He said, "All is well. My master has sent
me, saying, 'Behold, even now two young men of the sons of the prophets
have come to me from the hill country of Ephraim. Please give them a
talent of silver and two changes of clothing.'"

<span id="an_5:23">5:23</span> Naaman said, "Be pleased to take two
talents." He urged him, and bound two talents of silver in two bags,
with two changes of clothing, and laid them on two of his servants; and
they carried them before him.

<span id="an_5:24">5:24</span> When he came to the hill, he took them
from their hand, and stored them in the house. Then he let the men go,
and they departed.

<span id="an_5:25">5:25</span> But he went in, and stood before his
master. Elisha said to him, "Where did you come from, Gehazi?" He said,
"Your servant went nowhere."

<span id="an_5:26">5:26</span> He said to him, "Didn't my heart go with
you, when the man turned from his chariot to meet you? Is it a time to
receive money, and to receive garments, and olive groves and vineyards,
and sheep and cattle, and male servants and female servants?

<span id="an_5:27">5:27</span> Therefore the leprosy of Naaman will
cling to you and to your seed forever." He went out from his presence a
leper, as white as snow.

<span id="an_6:1">6:1</span> The sons of the prophets said to Elisha,
"See now, the place where we dwell before you is too small for us.

<span id="an_6:2">6:2</span> Please let us go to the Jordan, and every
man take a beam from there, and let us make us a place there, where we
may dwell." He answered, "Go!"

<span id="an_6:3">6:3</span> One said, "Please be pleased to go with
your servants." He answered, "I will go."

<span id="an_6:4">6:4</span> So he went with them. When they came to the
Jordan, they cut down wood.

<span id="an_6:5">6:5</span> But as one was felling a beam, the axe head
fell into the water. Then he cried, and said, "Alas, my master! For it
was borrowed."

<span id="an_6:6">6:6</span> The man of God asked, "Where did it fall?"
He showed him the place. He cut down a stick, threw it in there, and
made the iron float.

<span id="an_6:7">6:7</span> He said, "Take it." So he put out his hand
and took it.

<span id="an_6:8">6:8</span> Now the king of Syria was warring against
Israel; and he took counsel with his servants, saying, "My camp will be
in such and such a place."

<span id="an_6:9">6:9</span> The man of God sent to the king of Israel,
saying, "Beware that you not pass such a place; for the Syrians are
coming down there."

<span id="an_6:10">6:10</span> The king of Israel sent to the place
which the man of God told him and warned him of; and he saved himself
there, not once nor twice.

<span id="an_6:11">6:11</span> The heart of the king of Syria was very
troubled about this. He called his servants, and said to them, "Won't
you show me which of us is for the king of Israel?"

<span id="an_6:12">6:12</span> One of his servants said, "No, my lord, O
king; but Elisha, the prophet who is in Israel, tells the king of Israel
the words that you speak in your bedroom."

<span id="an_6:13">6:13</span> He said, "Go and see where he is, that I
may send and get him." It was told him, saying, "Behold, he is in
Dothan."

<span id="an_6:14">6:14</span> Therefore he sent horses, chariots, and a
great army there. They came by night, and surrounded the city.

<span id="an_6:15">6:15</span> When the servant of the man of God had
risen early, and gone out, behold, an army with horses and chariots was
around the city. His servant said to him, "Alas, my master! What shall
we do?"

<span id="an_6:16">6:16</span> He answered, "Don't be afraid; for those
who are with us are more than those who are with them."

<span id="an_6:17">6:17</span> Elisha prayed, and said, "Yahweh, please
open his eyes, that he may see." Yahweh opened the eyes of the young
man; and he saw: and behold, the mountain was full of horses and
chariots of fire around Elisha.

<span id="an_6:18">6:18</span> When they came down to him, Elisha prayed
to Yahweh, and said, "Please strike this people with blindness." He
struck them with blindness according to the word of Elisha.

<span id="an_6:19">6:19</span> Elisha said to them, "This is not the
way, neither is this the city. Follow me, and I will bring you to the
man whom you seek." He led them to Samaria.

<span id="an_6:20">6:20</span> It happened, when they were come into
Samaria, that Elisha said, "Yahweh, open the eyes of these men, that
they may see." Yahweh opened their eyes, and they saw; and behold, they
were in the midst of Samaria.

<span id="an_6:21">6:21</span> The king of Israel said to Elisha, when
he saw them, "My father, shall I strike them? Shall I strike them?"

<span id="an_6:22">6:22</span> He answered, "You shall not strike them.
Would you strike those whom you have taken captive with your sword and
with your bow? Set bread and water before them, that they may eat and
drink, and go to their master."

<span id="an_6:23">6:23</span> He prepared great feast for them. When
they had eaten and drunk, he sent them away, and they went to their
master. The bands of Syria stopped raiding the land of Israel.

<span id="an_6:24">6:24</span> It happened after this, that Benhadad
king of Syria gathered all his army, and went up and besieged Samaria.

<span id="an_6:25">6:25</span> There was a great famine in Samaria.
Behold, they besieged it, until a donkey's head was sold for eighty
pieces of silver, and the fourth part of a kab of dove's dung for five
pieces of silver.

<span id="an_6:26">6:26</span> As the king of Israel was passing by on
the wall, a woman cried to him, saying, "Help, my lord, O king!"

<span id="an_6:27">6:27</span> He said, "If Yahweh doesn't help you,
from where could I help you? From of the threshing floor, or from the
winepress?"

<span id="an_6:28">6:28</span> The king said to her, "What ails you?"
She answered, "This woman said to me, 'Give your son, that we may eat
him today, and we will eat my son tomorrow.'

<span id="an_6:29">6:29</span> So we boiled my son, and ate him: and I
said to her on the next day, 'Give your son, that we may eat him;' and
she has hidden her son."

<span id="an_6:30">6:30</span> It happened, when the king heard the
words of the woman, that he tore his clothes (now he was passing by on
the wall); and the people looked, and behold, he had sackcloth
underneath on his flesh.

<span id="an_6:31">6:31</span> Then he said, "God do so to me, and more
also, if the head of Elisha the son of Shaphat shall stay on him this
day."

<span id="an_6:32">6:32</span> But Elisha was sitting in his house, and
the elders were sitting with him. Then the king sent a man from before
him; but before the messenger came to him, he said to the elders, "Do
you see how this son of a murderer has sent to take away my head?
Behold, when the messenger comes, shut the door, and hold the door shut
against him. Isn't the sound of his master's feet behind him?"

<span id="an_6:33">6:33</span> While he was still talking with them,
behold, the messenger came down to him. Then he said, "Behold, this evil
is from Yahweh. Why should I wait for Yahweh any longer?"

<span id="an_7:1">7:1</span> Elisha said, "Hear the word of Yahweh. Thus
says Yahweh, 'Tomorrow about this time a measure of fine flour will be
sold for a shekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel, in the gate
of Samaria.'"

<span id="an_7:2">7:2</span> Then the captain on whose hand the king
leaned answered the man of God, and said, "Behold, if Yahweh made
windows in heaven, could this thing be?" He said, "Behold, you shall see
it with your eyes, but shall not eat of it."

<span id="an_7:3">7:3</span> Now there were four leprous men at the
entrance of the gate. They said one to another, "Why do we sit here
until we die?

<span id="an_7:4">7:4</span> If we say, 'We will enter into the city,'
then the famine is in the city, and we shall die there. If we sit still
here, we also die. Now therefore come, and let us surrender to the army
of the Syrians. If they save us alive, we will live; and if they kill
us, we will only die."

<span id="an_7:5">7:5</span> They rose up in the twilight, to go to the
camp of the Syrians. When they had come to the outermost part of the
camp of the Syrians, behold, there was no man there.

<span id="an_7:6">7:6</span> For the Lord had made the army of the
Syrians to hear a noise of chariots, and a noise of horses, even the
noise of a great army: and they said one to another, Behold, the king of
Israel has hired against us the kings of the Hittites, and the kings of
the Egyptians, to come on us.

<span id="an_7:7">7:7</span> Therefore they arose and fled in the
twilight, and left their tents, and their horses, and their donkeys,
even the camp as it was, and fled for their life.

<span id="an_7:8">7:8</span> When these lepers came to the outermost
part of the camp, they went into one tent, and ate and drink, and
carried there silver, and gold, and clothing, and went and hid it. Then
they came back, and entered into another tent, and carried there also,
and went and hid it.

<span id="an_7:9">7:9</span> Then they said one to another, "We aren't
doing right. This day is a day of good news, and we keep silent. If we
wait until the morning light, punishment will overtake us. Now therefore
come, let us go and tell the king's household."

<span id="an_7:10">7:10</span> So they came and called to the porter of
the city; and they told them, saying, "We came to the camp of the
Syrians, and, behold, there was no man there, neither voice of man, but
the horses tied, and the donkeys tied, and the tents as they were."

<span id="an_7:11">7:11</span> He called the porters; and they told it
to the king's household within.

<span id="an_7:12">7:12</span> The king arose in the night, and said to
his servants, "I will now show you what the Syrians have done to us.
They know that we are hungry. Therefore are they gone out of the camp to
hide themselves in the field, saying, 'When they come out of the city,
we shall take them alive, and get into the city.'"

<span id="an_7:13">7:13</span> One of his servants answered, "Please let
some take five of the horses that remain, which are left in the city.
Behold, they are like all the multitude of Israel who are left in it.
Behold, they are like all the multitude of Israel who are consumed. Let
us send and see."

<span id="an_7:14">7:14</span> They took therefore two chariots with
horses; and the king sent after the army of the Syrians, saying, "Go and
see."

<span id="an_7:15">7:15</span> They went after them to the Jordan; and
behold, all the way was full of garments and vessels, which the Syrians
had cast away in their haste. The messengers returned, and told the
king.

<span id="an_7:16">7:16</span> The people went out, and plundered the
camp of the Syrians. So a measure of fine flour was \[sold\] for a
shekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel, according to the word
of Yahweh.

<span id="an_7:17">7:17</span> The king appointed the captain on whose
hand he leaned to be in charge of the gate: and the people trod on him
in the gate, and he died as the man of God had said, who spoke when the
king came down to him.

<span id="an_7:18">7:18</span> It happened, as the man of God had spoken
to the king, saying, "Two measures of barley for a shekel, and a measure
of fine flour for a shekel, shall be tomorrow about this time in the
gate of Samaria;"

<span id="an_7:19">7:19</span> and that captain answered the man of God,
and said, "Now, behold, if Yahweh should make windows in heaven, might
such a thing be?" and he said, "Behold, you shall see it with your eyes,
but shall not eat of it."

<span id="an_7:20">7:20</span> It happened like that to him; for the
people trod on him in the gate, and he died.

<span id="an_8:1">8:1</span> Now Elisha had spoken to the woman, whose
son he had restored to life, saying, "Arise, and go, you and your
household, and stay for a while wherever you can; for Yahweh has called
for a famine. It shall also come on the land seven years."

<span id="an_8:2">8:2</span> The woman arose, and did according to the
word of the man of God. She went with her household, and lived in the
land of the Philistines seven years.

<span id="an_8:3">8:3</span> It happened at the seven years' end, that
the woman returned out of the land of the Philistines. Then she went
forth to cry to the king for her house and for her land.

<span id="an_8:4">8:4</span> Now the king was talking with Gehazi the
servant of the man of God, saying, "Please tell me all the great things
that Elisha has done."

<span id="an_8:5">8:5</span> It happened, as he was telling the king how
he had restored to life him who was dead, that behold, the woman, whose
son he had restored to life, cried to the king for her house and for her
land. Gehazi said, "My lord, O king, this is the woman, and this is her
son, whom Elisha restored to life."

<span id="an_8:6">8:6</span> When the king asked the woman, she told
him. So the king appointed to her a certain officer, saying, "Restore
all that was hers, and all the fruits of the field since the day that
she left the land, even until now."

<span id="an_8:7">8:7</span> Elisha came to Damascus; and Benhadad the
king of Syria was sick. It was told him, saying, "The man of God has
come here."

<span id="an_8:8">8:8</span> The king said to Hazael, "Take a present in
your hand, and go, meet the man of God, and inquire of Yahweh by him,
saying, 'Will I recover from this sickness?'"

<span id="an_8:9">8:9</span> So Hazael went to meet him, and took a
present with him, even of every good thing of Damascus, forty camels'
burden, and came and stood before him, and said, "Your son Benhadad king
of Syria has sent me to you, saying, 'Will I recover from this
sickness?'"

<span id="an_8:10">8:10</span> Elisha said to him, "Go, tell him, 'You
shall surely recover;' however Yahweh has shown me that he shall surely
die."

<span id="an_8:11">8:11</span> He settled his gaze steadfastly \[on
him\], until he was ashamed. Then the man of God wept.

<span id="an_8:12">8:12</span> Hazael said, "Why do you weep, my lord?"
He answered, "Because I know the evil that you will do to the children
of Israel. You will set their strongholds on fire, and you will kill
their young men with the sword, and will dash in pieces their little
ones, and rip up their women with child."

<span id="an_8:13">8:13</span> Hazael said, "But what is your servant,
who is but a dog, that he should do this great thing?" Elisha answered,
"Yahweh has shown me that you will be king over Syria."

<span id="an_8:14">8:14</span> Then he departed from Elisha, and came to
his master, who said to him, "What did Elisha say to you?" He answered,
"He told me that you would surely recover."

<span id="an_8:15">8:15</span> It happened on the next day, that he took
a thick cloth, dipped it in water, and spread it on his face, so that he
died. Then Hazael reigned in his place.

<span id="an_8:16">8:16</span> In the fifth year of Joram the son of
Ahab king of Israel, Jehoshaphat being king of Judah then, Jehoram the
son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah began to reign.

<span id="an_8:17">8:17</span> He was thirty-two years old when he began
to reign. He reigned eight years in Jerusalem.

<span id="an_8:18">8:18</span> He walked in the way of the kings of
Israel, as did the house of Ahab; for he had the daughter of Ahab as
wife. He did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh.

<span id="an_8:19">8:19</span> However Yahweh would not destroy Judah,
for David his servant's sake, as he promised him to give to him a lamp
for his children always.

<span id="an_8:20">8:20</span> In his days Edom revolted from under the
hand of Judah, and made a king over themselves.

<span id="an_8:21">8:21</span> Then Joram passed over to Zair, and all
his chariots with him: and he rose up by night, and struck the Edomites
who surrounded him, and the captains of the chariots; and the people
fled to their tents.

<span id="an_8:22">8:22</span> So Edom revolted from under the hand of
Judah to this day. Then did Libnah revolt at the same time.

<span id="an_8:23">8:23</span> The rest of the acts of Joram, and all
that he did, aren't they written in the book of the chronicles of the
kings of Judah?

<span id="an_8:24">8:24</span> Joram slept with his fathers, and was
buried with his fathers in the city of David; and Ahaziah his son
reigned in his place.

<span id="an_8:25">8:25</span> In the twelfth year of Joram the son of
Ahab king of Israel did Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah begin
to reign.

<span id="an_8:26">8:26</span> Twenty-two years old was Ahaziah when he
began to reign; and he reigned one year in Jerusalem. His mother's name
was Athaliah the daughter of Omri king of Israel.

<span id="an_8:27">8:27</span> He walked in the way of the house of
Ahab, and did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, as did the
house of Ahab; for he was the son-in-law of the house of Ahab.

<span id="an_8:28">8:28</span> He went with Joram the son of Ahab to war
against Hazael king of Syria at Ramoth Gilead: and the Syrians wounded
Joram.

<span id="an_8:29">8:29</span> King Joram returned to be healed in
Jezreel of the wounds which the Syrians had given him at Ramah, when he
fought against Hazael king of Syria. Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of
Judah went down to see Joram the son of Ahab in Jezreel, because he was
sick.

<span id="an_9:1">9:1</span> Elisha the prophet called one of the sons
of the prophets, and said to him, "Put your belt on your waist, take
this vial of oil in your hand, and go to Ramoth Gilead.

<span id="an_9:2">9:2</span> When you come there, find Jehu the son of
Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi, and go in, and make him arise up from
among his brothers, and carry him to an inner room.

<span id="an_9:3">9:3</span> Then take the vial of oil, and pour it on
his head, and say, 'Thus says Yahweh, "I have anointed you king over
Israel."' Then open the door, flee, and don't wait."

<span id="an_9:4">9:4</span> So the young man, even the young man the
prophet, went to Ramoth Gilead.

<span id="an_9:5">9:5</span> When he came, behold, the captains of the
army were sitting. Then he said, "I have a message for you, captain."
Jehu said, "To which of us all?" He said, "To you, O captain."

<span id="an_9:6">9:6</span> He arose, and went into the house. Then he
poured the oil on his head, and said to him, "Thus says Yahweh, the God
of Israel, 'I have anointed you king over the people of Yahweh, even
over Israel.

<span id="an_9:7">9:7</span> You shall strike the house of Ahab your
master, that I may avenge the blood of my servants the prophets, and the
blood of all the servants of Yahweh, at the hand of Jezebel.

<span id="an_9:8">9:8</span> For the whole house of Ahab shall perish. I
will cut off from Ahab everyone who urinates against a wall, both him
who is shut up and him who is left at large in Israel.

<span id="an_9:9">9:9</span> I will make the house of Ahab like the
house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son
of Ahijah.

<span id="an_9:10">9:10</span> The dogs will eat Jezebel on the plot of
ground of Jezreel, and there shall be none to bury her.'" He opened the
door, and fled.

<span id="an_9:11">9:11</span> Then Jehu came forth to the servants of
his lord: and one said to him, "Is all well? Why did this mad fellow
come to you?" He said to them, "You know the man and what his talk was."

<span id="an_9:12">9:12</span> They said, "That is a lie. Tell us now."
He said, "He said to me, 'Thus says Yahweh, I have anointed you king
over Israel.'"

<span id="an_9:13">9:13</span> Then they hurried, and took every man his
garment, and put it under him on the top of the stairs, and blew the
trumpet, saying, "Jehu is king."

<span id="an_9:14">9:14</span> So Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of
Nimshi conspired against Joram. (Now Joram was keeping Ramoth Gilead, he
and all Israel, because of Hazael king of Syria;

<span id="an_9:15">9:15</span> but king Joram was returned to be healed
in Jezreel of the wounds which the Syrians had given him, when he fought
with Hazael king of Syria.) Jehu said, "If this is your thinking, then
let no one escape and go out of the city, to go to tell it in Jezreel."

<span id="an_9:16">9:16</span> So Jehu rode in a chariot, and went to
Jezreel; for Joram lay there. Ahaziah king of Judah had come down to see
Joram.

<span id="an_9:17">9:17</span> Now the watchman was standing on the
tower in Jezreel, and he spied the company of Jehu as he came, and said,
"I see a company." Joram said, "Take a horseman, and send to meet them,
and let him say, 'Is it peace?'"

<span id="an_9:18">9:18</span> So there went one on horseback to meet
him, and said, "Thus says the king, 'Is it peace?'" Jehu said, "What do
you have to do with peace? Fall in behind me!" The watchman said, "The
messenger came to them, but he isn't coming back."

<span id="an_9:19">9:19</span> Then he sent out a second on horseback,
who came to them, and said, "Thus says the king, 'Is it peace?'" Jehu
answered, "What do you have to do with peace? Fall in behind me!"

<span id="an_9:20">9:20</span> The watchman said, "He came to them, and
isn't coming back. The driving is like the driving of Jehu the son of
Nimshi; for he drives furiously."

<span id="an_9:21">9:21</span> Joram said, "Get ready!" They got his
chariot ready. Joram king of Israel and Ahaziah king of Judah went out,
each in his chariot, and they went out to meet Jehu, and found him in
the portion of Naboth the Jezreelite.

<span id="an_9:22">9:22</span> It happened, when Joram saw Jehu, that he
said, "Is it peace, Jehu?" He answered, "What peace, so long as the
prostitution of your mother Jezebel and her witchcraft abound?"

<span id="an_9:23">9:23</span> Joram turned his hands, and fled, and
said to Ahaziah, "There is treason, Ahaziah!"

<span id="an_9:24">9:24</span> Jehu drew his bow with his full strength,
and struck Joram between his arms; and the arrow went out at his heart,
and he sunk down in his chariot.

<span id="an_9:25">9:25</span> Then Jehu said to Bidkar his captain,
"Pick him up, and throw him in the plot of the field of Naboth the
Jezreelite; for remember how, when you and I rode together after Ahab
his father, Yahweh laid this burden on him:

<span id="an_9:26">9:26</span> 'Surely I have seen yesterday the blood
of Naboth, and the blood of his sons,' says Yahweh; 'and I will repay
you in this plot of ground,' says Yahweh. Now therefore take and cast
him onto the plot of ground, according to the word of Yahweh."

<span id="an_9:27">9:27</span> But when Ahaziah the king of Judah saw
this, he fled by the way of the garden house. Jehu followed after him,
and said, "Strike him also in the chariot!" They struck him at the
ascent of Gur, which is by Ibleam. He fled to Megiddo, and died there.

<span id="an_9:28">9:28</span> His servants carried him in a chariot to
Jerusalem, and buried him in his tomb with his fathers in the city of
David.

<span id="an_9:29">9:29</span> In the eleventh year of Joram the son of
Ahab began Ahaziah to reign over Judah.

<span id="an_9:30">9:30</span> When Jehu was come to Jezreel, Jezebel
heard of it; and she painted her eyes, and attired her head, and looked
out at the window.

<span id="an_9:31">9:31</span> As Jehu entered in at the gate, she said,
"Do you come in peace, Zimri, you murderer of your master?"

<span id="an_9:32">9:32</span> He lifted up his face to the window, and
said, "Who is on my side? Who?" Two or three eunuchs looked out at him.

<span id="an_9:33">9:33</span> He said, "Throw her down!" So they threw
her down; and some of her blood was sprinkled on the wall, and on the
horses. Then he trampled her under foot.

<span id="an_9:34">9:34</span> When he was come in, he ate and drink;
and he said, "See now to this cursed woman, and bury her; for she is a
king's daughter."

<span id="an_9:35">9:35</span> They went to bury her; but they found no
more of her than the skull, and the feet, and the palms of her hands.

<span id="an_9:36">9:36</span> Therefore they came back, and told him.
He said, "This is the word of Yahweh, which he spoke by his servant
Elijah the Tishbite, saying, 'The dogs will eat the flesh of Jezebel on
the plot of Jezreel,

<span id="an_9:37">9:37</span> and the body of Jezebel shall be as dung
on the face of the field in the portion of Jezreel, so that they shall
not say, "This is Jezebel."'"

<span id="an_10:1">10:1</span> Now Ahab had seventy sons in Samaria.
Jehu wrote letters, and sent to Samaria, to the rulers of Jezreel, even
the elders, and to those who brought up \[the sons of\] Ahab, saying,

<span id="an_10:2">10:2</span> "Now as soon as this letter comes to you,
since your master's sons are with you, and there are with you chariots
and horses, a fortified city also, and armor.

<span id="an_10:3">10:3</span> Select the best and fittest of your
master's sons, set him on his father's throne, and fight for your
master's house."

<span id="an_10:4">10:4</span> But they were exceedingly afraid, and
said, "Behold, the two kings didn't stand before him! How then shall we
stand?"

<span id="an_10:5">10:5</span> He who was over the household, and he who
was over the city, the elders also, and those who raised the children,
sent to Jehu, saying, "We are your servants, and will do all that you
ask us. We will not make any man king. You do that which is good in your
eyes."

<span id="an_10:6">10:6</span> Then he wrote a letter the second time to
them, saying, "If you are on my side, and if you will listen to my
voice, take the heads of the men your master's sons, and come to me to
Jezreel by tomorrow this time." Now the king's sons, being seventy
persons, were with the great men of the city, who brought them up.

<span id="an_10:7">10:7</span> It happened, when the letter came to
them, that they took the king's sons, and killed them, even seventy
persons, and put their heads in baskets, and sent them to him to
Jezreel.

<span id="an_10:8">10:8</span> A messenger came, and told him, "They
have brought the heads of the king's sons." He said, "Lay them in two
heaps at the entrance of the gate until the morning."

<span id="an_10:9">10:9</span> It happened in the morning, that he went
out, and stood, and said to all the people, "You are righteous. Behold,
I conspired against my master, and killed him; but who struck all these?

<span id="an_10:10">10:10</span> Know now that nothing shall fall to the
earth of the word of Yahweh, which Yahweh spoke concerning the house of
Ahab. For Yahweh has done that which he spoke by his servant Elijah."

<span id="an_10:11">10:11</span> So Jehu struck all that remained of the
house of Ahab in Jezreel, with all his great men, his familiar friends,
and his priests, until he left him none remaining.

<span id="an_10:12">10:12</span> He arose and departed, and went to
Samaria. As he was at the shearing house of the shepherds on the way,

<span id="an_10:13">10:13</span> Jehu met with the brothers of Ahaziah
king of Judah, and said, "Who are you?" They answered, "We are the
brothers of Ahaziah. We are going down to greet the children of the king
and the children of the queen."

<span id="an_10:14">10:14</span> He said, "Take them alive!" They took
them alive, and killed them at the pit of the shearing house, even
forty-two men. He didn't leave any of them.

<span id="an_10:15">10:15</span> When he had departed from there, he met
Jehonadab the son of Rechab coming to meet him. He greeted him, and said
to him, "Is your heart right, as my heart is with your heart?" Jehonadab
answered, "It is." "If it is, give me your hand." He gave him his hand;
and he took him up to him into the chariot.

<span id="an_10:16">10:16</span> He said, "Come with me, and see my zeal
for Yahweh." So they made him ride in his chariot.

<span id="an_10:17">10:17</span> When he came to Samaria, he struck all
who remained to Ahab in Samaria, until he had destroyed him, according
to the word of Yahweh, which he spoke to Elijah.

<span id="an_10:18">10:18</span> Jehu gathered all the people together,
and said to them, "Ahab served Baal a little; but Jehu will serve him
much.

<span id="an_10:19">10:19</span> Now therefore call to me all the
prophets of Baal, all of his worshippers, and all of his priests. Let
none be absent; for I have a great sacrifice to Baal. Whoever is absent,
he shall not live." But Jehu did it in subtlety, intending that he might
destroy the worshippers of Baal.

<span id="an_10:20">10:20</span> Jehu said, "Sanctify a solemn assembly
for Baal!" They proclaimed it.

<span id="an_10:21">10:21</span> Jehu sent through all Israel; and all
the worshippers of Baal came, so that there was not a man left that
didn't come. They came into the house of Baal; and the house of Baal was
filled from one end to another.

<span id="an_10:22">10:22</span> He said to him who was over the vestry,
"Bring out robes for all the worshippers of Baal!" He brought robes out
to them.

<span id="an_10:23">10:23</span> Jehu went with Jehonadab the son of
Rechab into the house of Baal. Then he said to the worshippers of Baal,
"Search, and look that there are here with you none of the servants of
Yahweh, but the worshippers of Baal only."

<span id="an_10:24">10:24</span> They went in to offer sacrifices and
burnt offerings. Now Jehu had appointed him eighty men outside, and
said, "If any of the men whom I bring into your hands escape, \[he who
lets him go\], his life shall be for the life of him."

<span id="an_10:25">10:25</span> It happened, as soon as he had made an
end of offering the burnt offering, that Jehu said to the guard and to
the captains, "Go in, and kill them! Let none escape." They struck them
with the edge of the sword; and the guard and the captains cast them
out, and went to the city of the house of Baal.

<span id="an_10:26">10:26</span> They brought out the pillars that were
in the house of Baal, and burned them.

<span id="an_10:27">10:27</span> They broke down the pillar of Baal, and
broke down the house of Baal, and made it a latrine, to this day.

<span id="an_10:28">10:28</span> Thus Jehu destroyed Baal out of Israel.

<span id="an_10:29">10:29</span> However from the sins of Jeroboam the
son of Nebat, with which he made Israel to sin, Jehu didn't depart from
after them, \[to wit\], the golden calves that were in Bethel, and that
were in Dan.

<span id="an_10:30">10:30</span> Yahweh said to Jehu, "Because you have
done well in executing that which is right in my eyes, \[and\] have done
to the house of Ahab according to all that was in my heart, your sons of
the fourth generation shall sit on the throne of Israel."

<span id="an_10:31">10:31</span> But Jehu took no heed to walk in the
law of Yahweh, the God of Israel, with all his heart. He didn't depart
from the sins of Jeroboam, with which he made Israel to sin.

<span id="an_10:32">10:32</span> In those days Yahweh began to cut off
from Israel; and Hazael struck them in all the borders of Israel;

<span id="an_10:33">10:33</span> from the Jordan eastward, all the land
of Gilead, the Gadites, and the Reubenites, and the Manassites, from
Aroer, which is by the valley of the Arnon, even Gilead and Bashan.

<span id="an_10:34">10:34</span> Now the rest of the acts of Jehu, and
all that he did, and all his might, aren't they written in the book of
the chronicles of the kings of Israel?

<span id="an_10:35">10:35</span> Jehu slept with his fathers; and they
buried him in Samaria. Jehoahaz his son reigned in his place.

<span id="an_10:36">10:36</span> The time that Jehu reigned over Israel
in Samaria was twenty-eight years.

<span id="an_11:1">11:1</span> Now when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah
saw that her son was dead, she arose and destroyed all the seed royal.

<span id="an_11:2">11:2</span> But Jehosheba, the daughter of king
Joram, sister of Ahaziah, took Joash the son of Ahaziah, and stole him
away from among the king's sons who were slain, even him and his nurse,
\[and put them\] in the bedroom; and they hid him from Athaliah, so that
he was not slain;

<span id="an_11:3">11:3</span> He was with her hidden in the house of
Yahweh six years. Athaliah reigned over the land.

<span id="an_11:4">11:4</span> In the seventh year Jehoiada sent and
fetched the captains over hundreds of the Carites and of the guard, and
brought them to him into the house of Yahweh; and he made a covenant
with them, and took an oath of them in the house of Yahweh, and showed
them the king's son.

<span id="an_11:5">11:5</span> He commanded them, saying, "This is the
thing that you shall do: a third part of you, who come in on the
Sabbath, shall be keepers of the watch of the king's house;

<span id="an_11:6">11:6</span> A third part shall be at the gate Sur;
and a third part at the gate behind the guard. So you shall keep the
watch of the house, and be a barrier.

<span id="an_11:7">11:7</span> The two companies of you, even all who go
out on the Sabbath, shall keep the watch of the house of Yahweh around
the king.

<span id="an_11:8">11:8</span> You shall surround the king, every man
with his weapons in his hand; and he who comes within the ranks, let him
be slain. Be with the king when he goes out, and when he comes in."

<span id="an_11:9">11:9</span> The captains over hundreds did according
to all that Jehoiada the priest commanded; and they took every man his
men, those who were to come in on the Sabbath, with those who were to go
out on the Sabbath, and came to Jehoiada the priest.

<span id="an_11:10">11:10</span> The priest delivered to the captains
over hundreds the spears and shields that had been king David's, which
were in the house of Yahweh.

<span id="an_11:11">11:11</span> The guard stood, every man with his
weapons in his hand, from the right side of the house to the left side
of the house, along by the altar and the house, around the king.

<span id="an_11:12">11:12</span> Then he brought out the king's son, and
put the crown on him, and \[gave him\] the testimony; and they made him
king, and anointed him; and they clapped their hands, and said, "Long
live the king!"

<span id="an_11:13">11:13</span> When Athaliah heard the noise of the
guard \[and of\] the people, she came to the people into the house of
Yahweh:

<span id="an_11:14">11:14</span> and she looked, and behold, the king
stood by the pillar, as the tradition was, and the captains and the
trumpets by the king; and all the people of the land rejoiced, and blew
trumpets. Then Athaliah tore her clothes, and cried, "Treason! Treason!"

<span id="an_11:15">11:15</span> Jehoiada the priest commanded the
captains of hundreds who were set over the army, and said to them,
"Bring her out between the ranks. Kill him who follows her with the
sword." For the priest said, "Don't let her be slain in the house of
Yahweh."

<span id="an_11:16">11:16</span> So they made way for her; and she went
by the way of the horses' entry to the king's house. She was slain
there.

<span id="an_11:17">11:17</span> Jehoiada made a covenant between Yahweh
and the king and the people, that they should be Yahweh's people;
between the king also and the people.

<span id="an_11:18">11:18</span> All the people of the land went to the
house of Baal, and broke it down; his altars and his images broke they
in pieces thoroughly, and killed Mattan the priest of Baal before the
altars. The priest appointed officers over the house of Yahweh.

<span id="an_11:19">11:19</span> He took the captains over hundreds, and
the Carites, and the guard, and all the people of the land; and they
brought down the king from the house of Yahweh, and came by the way of
the gate of the guard to the king's house. He sat on the throne of the
kings.

<span id="an_11:20">11:20</span> So all the people of the land rejoiced,
and the city was quiet. Athaliah they had slain with the sword at the
king's house.

<span id="an_11:21">11:21</span> Jehoash was seven years old when he
began to reign.

<span id="an_12:1">12:1</span> In the seventh year of Jehu began Jehoash
to reign; and he reigned forty years in Jerusalem: and his mother's name
was Zibiah of Beersheba.

<span id="an_12:2">12:2</span> Jehoash did that which was right in the
eyes of Yahweh all his days in which Jehoiada the priest instructed him.

<span id="an_12:3">12:3</span> However the high places were not taken
away; the people still sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places.

<span id="an_12:4">12:4</span> Jehoash said to the priests, "All the
money of the holy things that is brought into the house of Yahweh, in
current money, the money of the persons for whom each man is rated, and
all the money that it comes into any man's heart to bring into the house
of Yahweh,

<span id="an_12:5">12:5</span> let the priests take it to them, every
man from his acquaintance; and they shall repair the breaches of the
house, wherever any breach shall be found."

<span id="an_12:6">12:6</span> But it was so, that in the three and
twentieth year of king Jehoash the priests had not repaired the breaches
of the house.

<span id="an_12:7">12:7</span> Then king Jehoash called for Jehoiada the
priest, and for the \[other\] priests, and said to them, "Why don't you
repair the breaches of the house? Now therefore take no more money from
your treasurers, but deliver it for the breaches of the house."

<span id="an_12:8">12:8</span> The priests consented that they should
take no \[more\] money from the people, neither repair the breaches of
the house.

<span id="an_12:9">12:9</span> But Jehoiada the priest took a chest, and
bored a hole in its lid, and set it beside the altar, on the right side
as one comes into the house of Yahweh: and the priests who kept the
threshold put therein all the money that was brought into the house of
Yahweh.

<span id="an_12:10">12:10</span> It was so, when they saw that there was
much money in the chest, that the king's scribe and the high priest came
up, and they put up in bags and counted the money that was found in the
house of Yahweh.

<span id="an_12:11">12:11</span> They gave the money that was weighed
out into the hands of those who did the work, who had the oversight of
the house of Yahweh: and they paid it out to the carpenters and the
builders, who worked on the house of Yahweh,

<span id="an_12:12">12:12</span> and to the masons and the stone
cutters, and for buying timber and cut stone to repair the breaches of
the house of Yahweh, and for all that was laid out for the house to
repair it.

<span id="an_12:13">12:13</span> But there were not made for the house
of Yahweh cups of silver, snuffers, basins, trumpets, any vessels of
gold, or vessels of silver, of the money that was brought into the house
of Yahweh;

<span id="an_12:14">12:14</span> for they gave that to those who did the
work, and repaired therewith the house of Yahweh.

<span id="an_12:15">12:15</span> Moreover they didn't demand an
accounting from the men into whose hand they delivered the money to give
to those who did the work; for they dealt faithfully.

<span id="an_12:16">12:16</span> The money for the trespass offerings,
and the money for the sin offerings, was not brought into the house of
Yahweh: it was the priests'.

<span id="an_12:17">12:17</span> Then Hazael king of Syria went up, and
fought against Gath, and took it; and Hazael set his face to go up to
Jerusalem.

<span id="an_12:18">12:18</span> Jehoash king of Judah took all the holy
things that Jehoshaphat and Jehoram and Ahaziah, his fathers, kings of
Judah, had dedicated, and his own holy things, and all the gold that was
found in the treasures of the house of Yahweh, and of the king's house,
and sent it to Hazael king of Syria: and he went away from Jerusalem.

<span id="an_12:19">12:19</span> Now the rest of the acts of Joash, and
all that he did, aren't they written in the book of the chronicles of
the kings of Judah?

<span id="an_12:20">12:20</span> His servants arose, and made a
conspiracy, and struck Joash at the house of Millo, \[on the way\] that
goes down to Silla.

<span id="an_12:21">12:21</span> For Jozacar the son of Shimeath, and
Jehozabad the son of Shomer, his servants, struck him, and he died; and
they buried him with his fathers in the city of David: and Amaziah his
son reigned in his place.

<span id="an_13:1">13:1</span> In the three and twentieth year of Joash
the son of Ahaziah, king of Judah, Jehoahaz the son of Jehu began to
reign over Israel in Samaria, \[and reigned\] seventeen years.

<span id="an_13:2">13:2</span> He did that which was evil in the sight
of Yahweh, and followed the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, with
which he made Israel to sin; he didn't depart from it.

<span id="an_13:3">13:3</span> The anger of Yahweh was kindled against
Israel, and he delivered them into the hand of Hazael king of Syria, and
into the hand of Benhadad the son of Hazael, continually.

<span id="an_13:4">13:4</span> Jehoahaz begged Yahweh, and Yahweh
listened to him; for he saw the oppression of Israel, how that the king
of Syria oppressed them.

<span id="an_13:5">13:5</span> (Yahweh gave Israel a savior, so that
they went out from under the hand of the Syrians; and the children of
Israel lived in their tents as before.

<span id="an_13:6">13:6</span> Nevertheless they didn't depart from the
sins of the house of Jeroboam, with which he made Israel to sin, but
walked therein: and there remained the Asherah also in Samaria.)

<span id="an_13:7">13:7</span> For he didn't leave to Jehoahaz of the
people any more than fifty horsemen, and ten chariots, and ten thousand
footmen; for the king of Syria destroyed them, and made them like the
dust in threshing.

<span id="an_13:8">13:8</span> Now the rest of the acts of Jehoahaz, and
all that he did, and his might, aren't they written in the book of the
chronicles of the kings of Israel?

<span id="an_13:9">13:9</span> Jehoahaz slept with his fathers; and they
buried him in Samaria: and Joash his son reigned in his place.

<span id="an_13:10">13:10</span> In the thirty-seventh year of Joash
king of Judah began Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz to reign over Israel in
Samaria, \[and reigned\] sixteen years.

<span id="an_13:11">13:11</span> He did that which was evil in the sight
of Yahweh; he didn't depart from all the sins of Jeroboam the son of
Nebat, with which he made Israel to sin; but he walked therein.

<span id="an_13:12">13:12</span> Now the rest of the acts of Joash, and
all that he did, and his might with which he fought against Amaziah king
of Judah, aren't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings
of Israel?

<span id="an_13:13">13:13</span> Joash slept with his fathers; and
Jeroboam sat on his throne: and Joash was buried in Samaria with the
kings of Israel.

<span id="an_13:14">13:14</span> Now Elisha was fallen sick of his
sickness of which he died: and Joash the king of Israel came down to
him, and wept over him, and said, "My father, my father, the chariots of
Israel and its horsemen!"

<span id="an_13:15">13:15</span> Elisha said to him, "Take bow and
arrows;" and he took to him bow and arrows.

<span id="an_13:16">13:16</span> He said to the king of Israel, "Put
your hand on the bow;" and he put his hand \[on it\]. Elisha laid his
hands on the king's hands.

<span id="an_13:17">13:17</span> He said, "Open the window eastward;"
and he opened it. Then Elisha said, "Shoot!" and he shot. He said,
"Yahweh's arrow of victory, even the arrow of victory over Syria; for
you shall strike the Syrians in Aphek, until you have consumed them."

<span id="an_13:18">13:18</span> He said, "Take the arrows;" and he took
them. He said to the king of Israel, "Strike the ground;" and he struck
three times, and stopped.

<span id="an_13:19">13:19</span> The man of God was angry with him, and
said, "You should have struck five or six times. Then you would have
struck Syria until you had consumed it, whereas now you shall strike
Syria just three times."

<span id="an_13:20">13:20</span> Elisha died, and they buried him. Now
the bands of the Moabites invaded the land at the coming in of the year.

<span id="an_13:21">13:21</span> It happened, as they were burying a
man, that behold, they spied a band; and they cast the man into the tomb
of Elisha: and as soon as the man touched the bones of Elisha, he
revived, and stood up on his feet.

<span id="an_13:22">13:22</span> Hazael king of Syria oppressed Israel
all the days of Jehoahaz.

<span id="an_13:23">13:23</span> But Yahweh was gracious to them, and
had compassion on them, and had respect to them, because of his covenant
with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and would not destroy them, neither cast
he them from his presence as yet.

<span id="an_13:24">13:24</span> Hazael king of Syria died; and Benhadad
his son reigned in his place.

<span id="an_13:25">13:25</span> Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz took again
out of the hand of Benhadad the son of Hazael the cities which he had
taken out of the hand of Jehoahaz his father by war. Three times did
Joash strike him, and recovered the cities of Israel.

<span id="an_14:1">14:1</span> In the second year of Joash son of Joahaz
king of Israel began Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah to reign.

<span id="an_14:2">14:2</span> He was twenty-five years old when he
began to reign; and he reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem: and his
mother's name was Jehoaddin of Jerusalem.

<span id="an_14:3">14:3</span> He did that which was right in the eyes
of Yahweh, yet not like David his father: he did according to all that
Joash his father had done.

<span id="an_14:4">14:4</span> However the high places were not taken
away: the people still sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places.

<span id="an_14:5">14:5</span> It happened, as soon as the kingdom was
established in his hand, that he killed his servants who had slain the
king his father:

<span id="an_14:6">14:6</span> but the children of the murderers he
didn't put to death; according to that which is written in the book of
the law of Moses, as Yahweh commanded, saying, "The fathers shall not be
put to death for the children, nor the children be put to death for the
fathers; but every man shall die for his own sin."

<span id="an_14:7">14:7</span> He killed of Edom in the Valley of Salt
ten thousand, and took Sela by war, and called its name Joktheel, to
this day.

<span id="an_14:8">14:8</span> Then Amaziah sent messengers to Jehoash,
the son of Jehoahaz son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, "Come, let us
look one another in the face."

<span id="an_14:9">14:9</span> Jehoash the king of Israel sent to
Amaziah king of Judah, saying, "The thistle that was in Lebanon sent to
the cedar that was in Lebanon, saying, 'Give your daughter to my son as
wife. Then a wild animal that was in Lebanon passed by, and trampled
down the thistle.

<span id="an_14:10">14:10</span> You have indeed struck Edom, and your
heart has lifted you up. Enjoy the glory of it, and stay at home; for
why should you meddle to your harm, that you should fall, even you, and
Judah with you?'"

<span id="an_14:11">14:11</span> But Amaziah would not listen. So
Jehoash king of Israel went up; and he and Amaziah king of Judah looked
one another in the face at Beth Shemesh, which belongs to Judah.

<span id="an_14:12">14:12</span> Judah was defeated by Israel; and they
fled every man to his tent.

<span id="an_14:13">14:13</span> Jehoash king of Israel took Amaziah
king of Judah, the son of Jehoash the son of Ahaziah, at Beth Shemesh,
and came to Jerusalem, and broke down the wall of Jerusalem from the
gate of Ephraim to the corner gate, four hundred cubits.

<span id="an_14:14">14:14</span> He took all the gold and silver, and
all the vessels that were found in the house of Yahweh, and in the
treasures of the king's house, the hostages also, and returned to
Samaria.

<span id="an_14:15">14:15</span> Now the rest of the acts of Jehoash
which he did, and his might, and how he fought with Amaziah king of
Judah, aren't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of
Israel?

<span id="an_14:16">14:16</span> Jehoash slept with his fathers, and was
buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel; and Jeroboam his son reigned
in his place.

<span id="an_14:17">14:17</span> Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah
lived after the death of Jehoash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel fifteen
years.

<span id="an_14:18">14:18</span> Now the rest of the acts of Amaziah,
aren't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?

<span id="an_14:19">14:19</span> They made a conspiracy against him in
Jerusalem; and he fled to Lachish: but they sent after him to Lachish,
and killed him there.

<span id="an_14:20">14:20</span> They brought him on horses; and he was
buried at Jerusalem with his fathers in the city of David.

<span id="an_14:21">14:21</span> All the people of Judah took Azariah,
who was sixteen years old, and made him king in the place of his father
Amaziah.

<span id="an_14:22">14:22</span> He built Elath, and restored it to
Judah, after that the king slept with his fathers.

<span id="an_14:23">14:23</span> In the fifteenth year of Amaziah the
son of Joash king of Judah Jeroboam the son of Joash king of Israel
began to reign in Samaria, \[and reigned\] forty-one years.

<span id="an_14:24">14:24</span> He did that which was evil in the sight
of Yahweh: he didn't depart from all the sins of Jeroboam the son of
Nebat, with which he made Israel to sin.

<span id="an_14:25">14:25</span> He restored the border of Israel from
the entrance of Hamath to the sea of the Arabah, according to the word
of Yahweh, the God of Israel, which he spoke by his servant Jonah the
son of Amittai, the prophet, who was of Gath Hepher.

<span id="an_14:26">14:26</span> For Yahweh saw the affliction of
Israel, that it was very bitter; for there was none shut up nor left at
large, neither was there any helper for Israel.

<span id="an_14:27">14:27</span> Yahweh didn't say that he would blot
out the name of Israel from under the sky; but he saved them by the hand
of Jeroboam the son of Joash.

<span id="an_14:28">14:28</span> Now the rest of the acts of Jeroboam,
and all that he did, and his might, how he warred, and how he recovered
Damascus, and Hamath, \[which had belonged\] to Judah, for Israel,
aren't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of
Israel?

<span id="an_14:29">14:29</span> Jeroboam slept with his fathers, even
with the kings of Israel; and Zechariah his son reigned in his place.

<span id="an_15:1">15:1</span> In the twenty-seventh year of Jeroboam
king of Israel began Azariah son of Amaziah king of Judah to reign.

<span id="an_15:2">15:2</span> Sixteen years old was he when he began to
reign; and he reigned fifty-two years in Jerusalem: and his mother's
name was Jecoliah of Jerusalem.

<span id="an_15:3">15:3</span> He did that which was right in the eyes
of Yahweh, according to all that his father Amaziah had done.

<span id="an_15:4">15:4</span> However the high places were not taken
away: the people still sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places.

<span id="an_15:5">15:5</span> Yahweh struck the king, so that he was a
leper to the day of his death, and lived in a separate house. Jotham the
king's son was over the household, judging the people of the land.

<span id="an_15:6">15:6</span> Now the rest of the acts of Azariah, and
all that he did, aren't they written in the book of the chronicles of
the kings of Judah?

<span id="an_15:7">15:7</span> Azariah slept with his fathers; and they
buried him with his fathers in the city of David: and Jotham his son
reigned in his place.

<span id="an_15:8">15:8</span> In the thirty-eighth year of Azariah king
of Judah did Zechariah the son of Jeroboam reign over Israel in Samaria
six months.

<span id="an_15:9">15:9</span> He did that which was evil in the sight
of Yahweh, as his fathers had done: he didn't depart from the sins of
Jeroboam the son of Nebat, with which he made Israel to sin.

<span id="an_15:10">15:10</span> Shallum the son of Jabesh conspired
against him, and struck him before the people, and killed him, and
reigned in his place.

<span id="an_15:11">15:11</span> Now the rest of the acts of Zechariah,
behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of
Israel.

<span id="an_15:12">15:12</span> This was the word of Yahweh which he
spoke to Jehu, saying, "Your sons to the fourth generation shall sit on
the throne of Israel." So it came to pass.

<span id="an_15:13">15:13</span> Shallum the son of Jabesh began to
reign in the thirty-ninth year of Uzziah king of Judah; and he reigned
for a month in Samaria.

<span id="an_15:14">15:14</span> Menahem the son of Gadi went up from
Tirzah, and came to Samaria, and struck Shallum the son of Jabesh in
Samaria, and killed him, and reigned in his place.

<span id="an_15:15">15:15</span> Now the rest of the acts of Shallum,
and his conspiracy which he made, behold, they are written in the book
of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.

<span id="an_15:16">15:16</span> Then Menahem struck Tiphsah, and all
who were therein, and its borders, from Tirzah: because they didn't open
to him, therefore he struck it; and all the women therein who were with
child he ripped up.

<span id="an_15:17">15:17</span> In the nine and thirtieth year of
Azariah king of Judah began Menahem the son of Gadi to reign over
Israel, \[and reigned\] ten years in Samaria.

<span id="an_15:18">15:18</span> He did that which was evil in the sight
of Yahweh: he didn't depart all his days from the sins of Jeroboam the
son of Nebat, with which he made Israel to sin.

<span id="an_15:19">15:19</span> There came against the land Pul the
king of Assyria; and Menahem gave Pul one thousand talents of silver,
that his hand might be with him to confirm the kingdom in his hand.

<span id="an_15:20">15:20</span> Menahem exacted the money of Israel,
even of all the mighty men of wealth, of each man fifty shekels of
silver, to give to the king of Assyria. So the king of Assyria turned
back, and didn't stay there in the land.

<span id="an_15:21">15:21</span> Now the rest of the acts of Menahem,
and all that he did, aren't they written in the book of the chronicles
of the kings of Israel?

<span id="an_15:22">15:22</span> Menahem slept with his fathers; and
Pekahiah his son reigned in his place.

<span id="an_15:23">15:23</span> In the fiftieth year of Azariah king of
Judah Pekahiah the son of Menahem began to reign over Israel in Samaria,
\[and reigned\] two years.

<span id="an_15:24">15:24</span> He did that which was evil in the sight
of Yahweh: he didn't depart from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat,
with which he made Israel to sin.

<span id="an_15:25">15:25</span> Pekah the son of Remaliah, his captain,
conspired against him, and struck him in Samaria, in the castle of the
king's house, with Argob and Arieh; and with him were fifty men of the
Gileadites: and he killed him, and reigned in his place.

<span id="an_15:26">15:26</span> Now the rest of the acts of Pekahiah,
and all that he did, behold, they are written in the book of the
chronicles of the kings of Israel.

<span id="an_15:27">15:27</span> In the two and fiftieth year of Azariah
king of Judah Pekah the son of Remaliah began to reign over Israel in
Samaria, \[and reigned\] twenty years.

<span id="an_15:28">15:28</span> He did that which was evil in the sight
of Yahweh: he didn't depart from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat,
with which he made Israel to sin.

<span id="an_15:29">15:29</span> In the days of Pekah king of Israel
came Tiglath Pileser king of Assyria, and took Ijon, and Abel Beth
Maacah, and Janoah, and Kedesh, and Hazor, and Gilead, and Galilee, all
the land of Naphtali; and he carried them captive to Assyria.

<span id="an_15:30">15:30</span> Hoshea the son of Elah made a
conspiracy against Pekah the son of Remaliah, and struck him, and killed
him, and reigned in his place, in the twentieth year of Jotham the son
of Uzziah.

<span id="an_15:31">15:31</span> Now the rest of the acts of Pekah, and
all that he did, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles
of the kings of Israel.

<span id="an_15:32">15:32</span> In the second year of Pekah the son of
Remaliah king of Israel began Jotham the son of Uzziah king of Judah to
reign.

<span id="an_15:33">15:33</span> He was twenty-five years old when he
began to reign; and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem: and his
mother's name was Jerusha the daughter of Zadok.

<span id="an_15:34">15:34</span> He did that which was right in the eyes
of Yahweh; he did according to all that his father Uzziah had done.

<span id="an_15:35">15:35</span> However the high places were not taken
away: the people still sacrificed and burned incense in the high places.
He built the upper gate of the house of Yahweh.

<span id="an_15:36">15:36</span> Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, and
all that he did, aren't they written in the book of the chronicles of
the kings of Judah?

<span id="an_15:37">15:37</span> In those days Yahweh began to send
against Judah Rezin the king of Syria, and Pekah the son of Remaliah.

<span id="an_15:38">15:38</span> Jotham slept with his fathers, and was
buried with his fathers in the city of David his father: and Ahaz his
son reigned in his place.

<span id="an_16:1">16:1</span> In the seventeenth year of Pekah the son
of Remaliah Ahaz the son of Jotham king of Judah began to reign.

<span id="an_16:2">16:2</span> Twenty years old was Ahaz when he began
to reign; and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem: and he didn't do
that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh his God, like David his
father.

<span id="an_16:3">16:3</span> But he walked in the way of the kings of
Israel, yes, and made his son to pass through the fire, according to the
abominations of the nations, whom Yahweh cast out from before the
children of Israel.

<span id="an_16:4">16:4</span> He sacrificed and burnt incense in the
high places, and on the hills, and under every green tree.

<span id="an_16:5">16:5</span> Then Rezin king of Syria and Pekah son of
Remaliah king of Israel came up to Jerusalem to war: and they besieged
Ahaz, but could not overcome him.

<span id="an_16:6">16:6</span> At that time Rezin king of Syria
recovered Elath to Syria, and drove the Jews from Elath; and the Syrians
came to Elath, and lived there, to this day.

<span id="an_16:7">16:7</span> So Ahaz sent messengers to Tiglath
Pileser king of Assyria, saying, "I am your servant and your son. Come
up, and save me out of the hand of the king of Syria, and out of the
hand of the king of Israel, who rise up against me."

<span id="an_16:8">16:8</span> Ahaz took the silver and gold that was
found in the house of Yahweh, and in the treasures of the king's house,
and sent it for a present to the king of Assyria.

<span id="an_16:9">16:9</span> The king of Assyria listened to him; and
the king of Assyria went up against Damascus, and took it, and carried
\[the people of\] it captive to Kir, and killed Rezin.

<span id="an_16:10">16:10</span> King Ahaz went to Damascus to meet
Tiglath Pileser king of Assyria, and saw the altar that was at Damascus;
and king Ahaz sent to Urijah the priest the fashion of the altar, and
its pattern, according to all its workmanship.

<span id="an_16:11">16:11</span> Urijah the priest built an altar:
according to all that king Ahaz had sent from Damascus, so did Urijah
the priest make it against the coming of king Ahaz from Damascus.

<span id="an_16:12">16:12</span> When the king was come from Damascus,
the king saw the altar: and the king drew near to the altar, and offered
thereon.

<span id="an_16:13">16:13</span> He burnt his burnt offering and his
meal offering, and poured his drink offering, and sprinkled the blood of
his peace offerings, on the altar.

<span id="an_16:14">16:14</span> The bronze altar, which was before
Yahweh, he brought from the forefront of the house, from between his
altar and the house of Yahweh, and put it on the north side of his
altar.

<span id="an_16:15">16:15</span> King Ahaz commanded Urijah the priest,
saying, "On the great altar burn the morning burnt offering, and the
evening meal offering, and the king's burnt offering, and his meal
offering, with the burnt offering of all the people of the land, and
their meal offering, and their drink offerings; and sprinkle on it all
the blood of the burnt offering, and all the blood of the sacrifice; but
the bronze altar shall be for me to inquire by."

<span id="an_16:16">16:16</span> Urijah the priest did so, according to
all that king Ahaz commanded.

<span id="an_16:17">16:17</span> King Ahaz cut off the panels of the
bases, and removed the basin from off them, and took down the sea from
off the bronze oxen that were under it, and put it on a pavement of
stone.

<span id="an_16:18">16:18</span> The covered way for the Sabbath that
they had built in the house, and the king's entry outside, turned he to
the house of Yahweh, because of the king of Assyria.

<span id="an_16:19">16:19</span> Now the rest of the acts of Ahaz which
he did, aren't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings
of Judah?

<span id="an_16:20">16:20</span> Ahaz slept with his fathers, and was
buried with his fathers in the city of David: and Hezekiah his son
reigned in his place.

<span id="an_17:1">17:1</span> In the twelfth year of Ahaz king of Judah
began Hoshea the son of Elah to reign in Samaria over Israel, \[and
reigned\] nine years.

<span id="an_17:2">17:2</span> He did that which was evil in the sight
of Yahweh, yet not as the kings of Israel who were before him.

<span id="an_17:3">17:3</span> Against him came up Shalmaneser king of
Assyria; and Hoshea became his servant, and brought him tribute.

<span id="an_17:4">17:4</span> The king of Assyria found conspiracy in
Hoshea; for he had sent messengers to So king of Egypt, and offered no
tribute to the king of Assyria, as he had done year by year: therefore
the king of Assyria shut him up, and bound him in prison.

<span id="an_17:5">17:5</span> Then the king of Assyria came up
throughout all the land, and went up to Samaria, and besieged it three
years.

<span id="an_17:6">17:6</span> In the ninth year of Hoshea the king of
Assyria took Samaria, and carried Israel away to Assyria, and placed
them in Halah, and on the Habor, the river of Gozan, and in the cities
of the Medes.

<span id="an_17:7">17:7</span> It was so, because the children of Israel
had sinned against Yahweh their God, who brought them up out of the land
of Egypt from under the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and had feared
other gods,

<span id="an_17:8">17:8</span> and walked in the statutes of the
nations, whom Yahweh cast out from before the children of Israel, and of
the kings of Israel, which they made.

<span id="an_17:9">17:9</span> The children of Israel did secretly
things that were not right against Yahweh their God: and they built them
high places in all their cities, from the tower of the watchmen to the
fortified city;

<span id="an_17:10">17:10</span> and they set them up pillars and
Asherim on every high hill, and under every green tree;

<span id="an_17:11">17:11</span> and there they burnt incense in all the
high places, as did the nations whom Yahweh carried away before them;
and they worked wicked things to provoke Yahweh to anger;

<span id="an_17:12">17:12</span> and they served idols, of which Yahweh
had said to them, "You shall not do this thing."

<span id="an_17:13">17:13</span> Yet Yahweh testified to Israel, and to
Judah, by every prophet, and every seer, saying, "Turn from your evil
ways, and keep my commandments and my statutes, according to all the law
which I commanded your fathers, and which I sent to you by my servants
the prophets."

<span id="an_17:14">17:14</span> Notwithstanding, they would not listen,
but hardened their neck, like the neck of their fathers, who didn't
believe in Yahweh their God.

<span id="an_17:15">17:15</span> They rejected his statutes, and his
covenant that he made with their fathers, and his testimonies which he
testified to them; and they followed vanity, and became vain, and
\[went\] after the nations that were around them, concerning whom Yahweh
had commanded them that they should not do like them.

<span id="an_17:16">17:16</span> They forsook all the commandments of
Yahweh their God, and made them molten images, even two calves, and made
an Asherah, and worshiped all the army of the sky, and served Baal.

<span id="an_17:17">17:17</span> They caused their sons and their
daughters to pass through the fire, and used divination and
enchantments, and sold themselves to do that which was evil in the sight
of Yahweh, to provoke him to anger.

<span id="an_17:18">17:18</span> Therefore Yahweh was very angry with
Israel, and removed them out of his sight: there was none left but the
tribe of Judah only.

<span id="an_17:19">17:19</span> Also Judah didn't keep the commandments
of Yahweh their God, but walked in the statutes of Israel which they
made.

<span id="an_17:20">17:20</span> Yahweh rejected all the seed of Israel,
and afflicted them, and delivered them into the hand of spoilers, until
he had cast them out of his sight.

<span id="an_17:21">17:21</span> For he tore Israel from the house of
David; and they made Jeroboam the son of Nebat king: and Jeroboam drove
Israel from following Yahweh, and made them sin a great sin.

<span id="an_17:22">17:22</span> The children of Israel walked in all
the sins of Jeroboam which he did; they didn't depart from them;

<span id="an_17:23">17:23</span> until Yahweh removed Israel out of his
sight, as he spoke by all his servants the prophets. So Israel was
carried away out of their own land to Assyria to this day.

<span id="an_17:24">17:24</span> The king of Assyria brought men from
Babylon, and from Cuthah, and from Avva, and from Hamath and Sepharvaim,
and placed them in the cities of Samaria instead of the children of
Israel; and they possessed Samaria, and lived in the cities of it.

<span id="an_17:25">17:25</span> So it was, at the beginning of their
dwelling there, that they didn't fear Yahweh: therefore Yahweh sent
lions among them, which killed some of them.

<span id="an_17:26">17:26</span> Therefore they spoke to the king of
Assyria, saying, "The nations which you have carried away, and placed in
the cities of Samaria, don't know the law of the god of the land.
Therefore he has sent lions among them, and behold, they kill them,
because they don't know the law of the god of the land."

<span id="an_17:27">17:27</span> Then the king of Assyria commanded,
saying, "Carry there one of the priests whom you brought from there; and
let them go and dwell there, and let him teach them the law of the god
of the land."

<span id="an_17:28">17:28</span> So one of the priests whom they had
carried away from Samaria came and lived in Bethel, and taught them how
they should fear Yahweh.

<span id="an_17:29">17:29</span> However every nation made gods of their
own, and put them in the houses of the high places which the Samaritans
had made, every nation in their cities in which they lived.

<span id="an_17:30">17:30</span> The men of Babylon made Succoth Benoth,
and the men of Cuth made Nergal, and the men of Hamath made Ashima,

<span id="an_17:31">17:31</span> and the Avvites made Nibhaz and Tartak;
and the Sepharvites burnt their children in the fire to Adrammelech and
Anammelech, the gods of Sepharvaim.

<span id="an_17:32">17:32</span> So they feared Yahweh, and made to them
from among themselves priests of the high places, who sacrificed for
them in the houses of the high places.

<span id="an_17:33">17:33</span> They feared Yahweh, and served their
own gods, after the ways of the nations from among whom they had been
carried away.

<span id="an_17:34">17:34</span> To this day they do what they did
before: they don't fear Yahweh, neither do they follow their statutes,
or their ordinances, or the law or the commandment which Yahweh
commanded the children of Jacob, whom he named Israel;

<span id="an_17:35">17:35</span> with whom Yahweh had made a covenant,
and commanded them, saying, "You shall not fear other gods, nor bow
yourselves to them, nor serve them, nor sacrifice to them;

<span id="an_17:36">17:36</span> but you shall fear Yahweh, who brought
you up out of the land of Egypt with great power and with an
outstretched arm, and you shall bow yourselves to him, and you shall
sacrifice to him.

<span id="an_17:37">17:37</span> The statutes and the ordinances, and
the law and the commandment, which he wrote for you, you shall observe
to do forevermore. You shall not fear other gods.

<span id="an_17:38">17:38</span> You shall not forget the covenant that
I have made with you; neither shall you fear other gods.

<span id="an_17:39">17:39</span> But you shall fear Yahweh your God; and
he will deliver you out of the hand of all your enemies."

<span id="an_17:40">17:40</span> However they did not listen, but they
did what they did before.

<span id="an_17:41">17:41</span> So these nations feared Yahweh, and
served their engraved images. Their children likewise, and their
children's children, as their fathers did, so they do to this day.

<span id="an_18:1">18:1</span> Now it happened in the third year of
Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel, that Hezekiah the son of Ahaz king of
Judah began to reign.

<span id="an_18:2">18:2</span> He was twenty-five years old when he
began to reign; and he reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem: and his
mother's name was Abi the daughter of Zechariah.

<span id="an_18:3">18:3</span> He did that which was right in the eyes
of Yahweh, according to all that David his father had done.

<span id="an_18:4">18:4</span> He removed the high places, and broke the
pillars, and cut down the Asherah: and he broke in pieces the bronze
serpent that Moses had made; for to those days the children of Israel
did burn incense to it; and he called it Nehushtan.

<span id="an_18:5">18:5</span> He trusted in Yahweh, the God of Israel;
so that after him was none like him among all the kings of Judah, nor
\[among them\] that were before him.

<span id="an_18:6">18:6</span> For he joined with Yahweh; he didn't
depart from following him, but kept his commandments, which Yahweh
commanded Moses.

<span id="an_18:7">18:7</span> Yahweh was with him; wherever he went
forth he prospered: and he rebelled against the king of Assyria, and
didn't serve him.

<span id="an_18:8">18:8</span> He struck the Philistines to Gaza and its
borders, from the tower of the watchmen to the fortified city.

<span id="an_18:9">18:9</span> It happened in the fourth year of king
Hezekiah, which was the seventh year of Hoshea son of Elah king of
Israel, that Shalmaneser king of Assyria came up against Samaria, and
besieged it.

<span id="an_18:10">18:10</span> At the end of three years they took it:
in the sixth year of Hezekiah, which was the ninth year of Hoshea king
of Israel, Samaria was taken.

<span id="an_18:11">18:11</span> The king of Assyria carried Israel away
to Assyria, and put them in Halah, and on the Habor, the river of Gozan,
and in the cities of the Medes,

<span id="an_18:12">18:12</span> because they didn't obey the voice of
Yahweh their God, but transgressed his covenant, even all that Moses the
servant of Yahweh commanded, and would not hear it, nor do it.

<span id="an_18:13">18:13</span> Now in the fourteenth year of king
Hezekiah did Sennacherib king of Assyria come up against all the
fortified cities of Judah, and took them.

<span id="an_18:14">18:14</span> Hezekiah king of Judah sent to the king
of Assyria to Lachish, saying, "I have offended; return from me. That
which you put on me, I will bear." The king of Assyria appointed to
Hezekiah king of Judah three hundred talents of silver and thirty
talents of gold.

<span id="an_18:15">18:15</span> Hezekiah gave \[him\] all the silver
that was found in the house of Yahweh, and in the treasures of the
king's house.

<span id="an_18:16">18:16</span> At that time did Hezekiah cut off \[the
gold from\] the doors of the temple of Yahweh, and \[from\] the pillars
which Hezekiah king of Judah had overlaid, and gave it to the king of
Assyria.

<span id="an_18:17">18:17</span> The king of Assyria sent Tartan and
Rabsaris and Rabshakeh from Lachish to king Hezekiah with a great army
to Jerusalem. They went up and came to Jerusalem. When they were come
up, they came and stood by the conduit of the upper pool, which is in
the highway of the fuller's field.

<span id="an_18:18">18:18</span> When they had called to the king, there
came out to them Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household,
and Shebnah the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder.

<span id="an_18:19">18:19</span> Rabshakeh said to them, "Say now to
Hezekiah, 'Thus says the great king, the king of Assyria, "What
confidence is this in which you trust?

<span id="an_18:20">18:20</span> You say (but they are but vain words),
'There is counsel and strength for war.' Now on whom do you trust, that
you have rebelled against me?

<span id="an_18:21">18:21</span> Now, behold, you trust in the staff of
this bruised reed, even in Egypt. If a man leans on it, it will go into
his hand, and pierce it. So is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all who trust on
him.

<span id="an_18:22">18:22</span> But if you tell me, 'We trust in Yahweh
our God;' isn't that he whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah has
taken away, and has said to Judah and to Jerusalem, 'You shall worship
before this altar in Jerusalem?'

<span id="an_18:23">18:23</span> Now therefore, please give pledges to
my master the king of Assyria, and I will give you two thousand horses,
if you are able on your part to set riders on them.

<span id="an_18:24">18:24</span> How then can you turn away the face of
one captain of the least of my master's servants, and put your trust on
Egypt for chariots and for horsemen?

<span id="an_18:25">18:25</span> Have I now come up without Yahweh
against this place to destroy it? Yahweh said to me, 'Go up against this
land, and destroy it.'"'"

<span id="an_18:26">18:26</span> Then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, and
Shebnah, and Joah, said to Rabshakeh, "Please speak to your servants in
the Syrian language; for we understand it. Don't speak with us in the
Jews' language, in the hearing of the people who are on the wall."

<span id="an_18:27">18:27</span> But Rabshakeh said to them, "Has my
master sent me to your master, and to you, to speak these words? Hasn't
he sent me to the men who sit on the wall, to eat their own dung, and to
drink their own water with you?"

<span id="an_18:28">18:28</span> Then Rabshakeh stood, and cried with a
loud voice in the Jews' language, and spoke, saying, "Hear the word of
the great king, the king of Assyria.

<span id="an_18:29">18:29</span> Thus says the king, 'Don't let Hezekiah
deceive you; for he will not be able to deliver you out of his hand.

<span id="an_18:30">18:30</span> Neither let Hezekiah make you trust in
Yahweh, saying, "Yahweh will surely deliver us, and this city shall not
be given into the hand of the king of Assyria."

<span id="an_18:31">18:31</span> Don't listen to Hezekiah.' For thus
says the king of Assyria, 'Make your peace with me, and come out to me;
and everyone of you eat of his vine, and everyone of his fig tree, and
everyone drink the waters of his own cistern;

<span id="an_18:32">18:32</span> until I come and take you away to a
land like your own land, a land of grain and new wine, a land of bread
and vineyards, a land of olive trees and of honey, that you may live,
and not die. Don't listen to Hezekiah, when he persuades you, saying,
"Yahweh will deliver us."

<span id="an_18:33">18:33</span> Has any of the gods of the nations ever
delivered his land out of the hand of the king of Assyria?

<span id="an_18:34">18:34</span> Where are the gods of Hamath, and of
Arpad? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim, of Hena, and Ivvah? Have they
delivered Samaria out of my hand?

<span id="an_18:35">18:35</span> Who are they among all the gods of the
countries, that have delivered their country out of my hand, that Yahweh
should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand?'"

<span id="an_18:36">18:36</span> But the people held their peace, and
answered him not a word; for the king's commandment was, "Don't answer
him."

<span id="an_18:37">18:37</span> Then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who
was over the household, came with Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son of
Asaph the recorder, to Hezekiah with their clothes torn, and told him
the words of Rabshakeh.

<span id="an_19:1">19:1</span> It happened, when king Hezekiah heard it,
that he tore his clothes, and covered himself with sackcloth, and went
into the house of Yahweh.

<span id="an_19:2">19:2</span> He sent Eliakim, who was over the
household, and Shebna the scribe, and the elders of the priests, covered
with sackcloth, to Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz.

<span id="an_19:3">19:3</span> They said to him, "Thus says Hezekiah,
'This day is a day of trouble, of rebuke, and of rejection; for the
children have come to the point of birth, and there is no strength to
deliver them.

<span id="an_19:4">19:4</span> It may be Yahweh your God will hear all
the words of Rabshakeh, whom the king of Assyria his master has sent to
defy the living God, and will rebuke the words which Yahweh your God has
heard. Therefore lift up your prayer for the remnant that is left.'"

<span id="an_19:5">19:5</span> So the servants of king Hezekiah came to
Isaiah.

<span id="an_19:6">19:6</span> Isaiah said to them, "Thus you shall tell
your master, 'Thus says Yahweh, "Don't be afraid of the words that you
have heard, with which the servants of the king of Assyria have
blasphemed me.

<span id="an_19:7">19:7</span> Behold, I will put a spirit in him, and
he will hear news, and will return to his own land. I will cause him to
fall by the sword in his own land."'"

<span id="an_19:8">19:8</span> So Rabshakeh returned, and found the king
of Assyria warring against Libnah; for he had heard that he had departed
from Lachish.

<span id="an_19:9">19:9</span> When he heard it said of Tirhakah king of
Ethiopia, "Behold, he has come out to fight against you, he sent
messengers again to Hezekiah, saying,

<span id="an_19:10">19:10</span> 'Thus you shall speak to Hezekiah king
of Judah, saying, "Don't let your God in whom you trust deceive you,
saying, Jerusalem will not be given into the hand of the king of
Assyria.

<span id="an_19:11">19:11</span> Behold, you have heard what the kings
of Assyria have done to all lands, by destroying them utterly. Will you
be delivered?

<span id="an_19:12">19:12</span> Have the gods of the nations delivered
them, which my fathers have destroyed, Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and
the children of Eden that were in Telassar?

<span id="an_19:13">19:13</span> Where is the king of Hamath, and the
king of Arpad, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, of Hena, and
Ivvah?"'"

<span id="an_19:14">19:14</span> Hezekiah received the letter from the
hand of the messengers, and read it. Then Hezekiah went up to the house
of Yahweh, and spread it before Yahweh.

<span id="an_19:15">19:15</span> Hezekiah prayed before Yahweh, and
said, "Yahweh, the God of Israel, who sit \[above\] the cherubim, you
are the God, even you alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth. You have
made heaven and earth.

<span id="an_19:16">19:16</span> Incline your ear, Yahweh, and hear.
Open your eyes, Yahweh, and see. Hear the words of Sennacherib, with
which he has sent to defy the living God.

<span id="an_19:17">19:17</span> Truly, Yahweh, the kings of Assyria
have laid waste the nations and their lands,

<span id="an_19:18">19:18</span> and have cast their gods into the fire;
for they were no gods, but the work of men's hands, wood and stone.
Therefore they have destroyed them.

<span id="an_19:19">19:19</span> Now therefore, Yahweh our God, save us,
I beg you, out of his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know
that you, Yahweh, are God alone."

<span id="an_19:20">19:20</span> Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to
Hezekiah, saying, "Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel, 'Whereas you
have prayed to me against Sennacherib king of Assyria, I have heard you.

<span id="an_19:21">19:21</span> This is the word that Yahweh has spoken
concerning him: "The virgin daughter of Zion has despised you and
ridiculed you. The daughter of Jerusalem has shaken her head at you.

<span id="an_19:22">19:22</span> Whom have you defied and blasphemed?
Against whom have you exalted your voice and lifted up your eyes on
high? Against the Holy One of Israel.

<span id="an_19:23">19:23</span> By your messengers you have defied the
Lord, and have said, 'With the multitude of my chariots, I have come up
to the height of the mountains, to the innermost parts of Lebanon; and I
will cut down its tall cedars, and its choice fir trees; and I will
enter into his farthest lodging place, the forest of his fruitful field.

<span id="an_19:24">19:24</span> I have dug and drunk strange waters,
and with the sole of my feet will I dry up all the rivers of Egypt.'

<span id="an_19:25">19:25</span> Haven't you heard how I have done it
long ago, and formed it of ancient times? Now have I brought it to pass,
that it should be yours to lay waste fortified cities into ruinous
heaps.

<span id="an_19:26">19:26</span> Therefore their inhabitants were of
small power. They were dismayed and confounded. They were like the grass
of the field, and like the green herb, like the grass on the housetops,
and like grain blasted before it has grown up.

<span id="an_19:27">19:27</span> But I know your sitting down, and your
going out, and your coming in, and your raging against me.

<span id="an_19:28">19:28</span> Because of your raging against me, and
because your arrogance has come up into my ears, therefore will I put my
hook in your nose, and my bridle in your lips, and I will turn you back
by the way by which you came."

<span id="an_19:29">19:29</span> "'This shall be the sign to you: You
shall eat this year that which grows of itself, and in the second year
that which springs of the same; and in the third year sow, and reap, and
plant vineyards, and eat its fruit.

<span id="an_19:30">19:30</span> The remnant that has escaped of the
house of Judah shall again take root downward, and bear fruit upward.

<span id="an_19:31">19:31</span> For out of Jerusalem a remnant will go
out, and out of Mount Zion those who shall escape. The zeal of Yahweh
will perform this.'

<span id="an_19:32">19:32</span> "Therefore thus says Yahweh concerning
the king of Assyria, 'He shall not come to this city, nor shoot an arrow
there, neither shall he come before it with shield, nor cast up a mound
against it.

<span id="an_19:33">19:33</span> By the way that he came, by the same
shall he return, and he shall not come to this city,' says Yahweh.

<span id="an_19:34">19:34</span> 'For I will defend this city to save
it, for my own sake, and for my servant David's sake.'"

<span id="an_19:35">19:35</span> It happened that night, that the angel
of Yahweh went out, and struck one hundred eighty-five thousand in the
camp of the Assyrians. When men arose early in the morning, behold,
these were all dead bodies.

<span id="an_19:36">19:36</span> So Sennacherib king of Assyria
departed, and went and returned, and lived at Nineveh.

<span id="an_19:37">19:37</span> It happened, as he was worshipping in
the house of Nisroch his god, that Adrammelech and Sharezer struck him
with the sword; and they escaped into the land of Ararat. Esar Haddon
his son reigned in his place.

<span id="an_20:1">20:1</span> In those days was Hezekiah sick to death.
Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz came to him, and said to him, "Thus
says Yahweh, 'Set your house in order; for you shall die, and not
live.'"

<span id="an_20:2">20:2</span> Then he turned his face to the wall, and
prayed to Yahweh, saying,

<span id="an_20:3">20:3</span> "Remember now, Yahweh, I beg you, how I
have walked before you in truth and with a perfect heart, and have done
that which is good in your sight." Hezekiah wept bitterly.

<span id="an_20:4">20:4</span> It happened, before Isaiah had gone out
into the middle part of the city, that the word of Yahweh came to him,
saying,

<span id="an_20:5">20:5</span> "Turn back, and tell Hezekiah the prince
of my people, 'Thus says Yahweh, the God of David your father, "I have
heard your prayer. I have seen your tears. Behold, I will heal you. On
the third day, you shall go up to the house of Yahweh.

<span id="an_20:6">20:6</span> I will add to your days fifteen years. I
will deliver you and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria. I
will defend this city for my own sake, and for my servant David's
sake."'"

<span id="an_20:7">20:7</span> Isaiah said, "Take a cake of figs." They
took and laid it on the boil, and he recovered.

<span id="an_20:8">20:8</span> Hezekiah said to Isaiah, "What shall be
the sign that Yahweh will heal me, and that I shall go up to the house
of Yahweh the third day?"

<span id="an_20:9">20:9</span> Isaiah said, "This shall be the sign to
you from Yahweh, that Yahweh will do the thing that he has spoken: shall
the shadow go forward ten steps, or go back ten steps?"

<span id="an_20:10">20:10</span> Hezekiah answered, "It is a light thing
for the shadow to go forward ten steps. Nay, but let the shadow return
backward ten steps."

<span id="an_20:11">20:11</span> Isaiah the prophet cried to Yahweh; and
he brought the shadow ten steps backward, by which it had gone down on
the dial of Ahaz.

<span id="an_20:12">20:12</span> At that time Berodach Baladan the son
of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a present to Hezekiah; for
he had heard that Hezekiah had been sick.

<span id="an_20:13">20:13</span> Hezekiah listened to them, and showed
them all the house of his precious things, the silver, and the gold, and
the spices, and the precious oil, and the house of his armor, and all
that was found in his treasures: there was nothing in his house, nor in
all his dominion, that Hezekiah didn't show them.

<span id="an_20:14">20:14</span> Then Isaiah the prophet came to king
Hezekiah, and said to him, "What did these men say? From where did they
come to you?" Hezekiah said, "They are come from a far country, even
from Babylon."

<span id="an_20:15">20:15</span> He said, "What have they seen in your
house?" Hezekiah answered, "They have seen all that is in my house.
There is nothing among my treasures that I have not shown them."

<span id="an_20:16">20:16</span> Isaiah said to Hezekiah, "Hear the word
of Yahweh.

<span id="an_20:17">20:17</span> 'Behold, the days come, that all that
is in your house, and that which your fathers have laid up in store to
this day, shall be carried to Babylon. Nothing shall be left,' says
Yahweh.

<span id="an_20:18">20:18</span> 'Of your sons who shall issue from you,
whom you shall father, shall they take away; and they shall be eunuchs
in the palace of the king of Babylon.'"

<span id="an_20:19">20:19</span> Then Hezekiah said to Isaiah, "The word
of Yahweh which you have spoken is good." He said moreover, "Isn't it
so, if peace and truth shall be in my days?"

<span id="an_20:20">20:20</span> Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah,
and all his might, and how he made the pool, and the conduit, and
brought water into the city, aren't they written in the book of the
chronicles of the kings of Judah?

<span id="an_20:21">20:21</span> Hezekiah slept with his fathers; and
Manasseh his son reigned in his place.

<span id="an_21:1">21:1</span> Manasseh was twelve years old when he
began to reign; and he reigned fifty-five years in Jerusalem: and his
mother's name was Hephzibah.

<span id="an_21:2">21:2</span> He did that which was evil in the sight
of Yahweh, after the abominations of the nations whom Yahweh cast out
before the children of Israel.

<span id="an_21:3">21:3</span> For he built again the high places which
Hezekiah his father had destroyed; and he reared up altars for Baal, and
made an Asherah, as did Ahab king of Israel, and worshiped all the army
of the sky, and served them.

<span id="an_21:4">21:4</span> He built altars in the house of Yahweh,
of which Yahweh said, "I will put my name in Jerusalem."

<span id="an_21:5">21:5</span> He built altars for all the army of the
sky in the two courts of the house of Yahweh.

<span id="an_21:6">21:6</span> He made his son to pass through the fire,
and practiced sorcery, and used enchantments, and dealt with those who
had familiar spirits, and with wizards: he worked much evil in the sight
of Yahweh, to provoke him to anger.

<span id="an_21:7">21:7</span> He set the engraved image of Asherah,
that he had made, in the house of which Yahweh said to David and to
Solomon his son, "In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen
out of all the tribes of Israel, will I put my name forever;

<span id="an_21:8">21:8</span> neither will I cause the feet of Israel
to wander any more out of the land which I gave their fathers, if only
they will observe to do according to all that I have commanded them, and
according to all the law that my servant Moses commanded them."

<span id="an_21:9">21:9</span> But they didn't listen: and Manasseh
seduced them to do that which is evil more than did the nations whom
Yahweh destroyed before the children of Israel.

<span id="an_21:10">21:10</span> Yahweh spoke by his servants the
prophets, saying,

<span id="an_21:11">21:11</span> "Because Manasseh king of Judah has
done these abominations, and has done wickedly above all that the
Amorites did, who were before him, and has made Judah also to sin with
his idols;

<span id="an_21:12">21:12</span> therefore thus says Yahweh, the God of
Israel, 'Behold, I bring such evil on Jerusalem and Judah, that whoever
hears of it, both his ears shall tingle.

<span id="an_21:13">21:13</span> I will stretch over Jerusalem the line
of Samaria, and the plummet of the house of Ahab; and I will wipe
Jerusalem as a man wipes a dish, wiping it and turning it upside down.

<span id="an_21:14">21:14</span> I will cast off the remnant of my
inheritance, and deliver them into the hand of their enemies. They will
become a prey and a spoil to all their enemies;

<span id="an_21:15">21:15</span> because they have done that which is
evil in my sight, and have provoked me to anger, since the day their
fathers came forth out of Egypt, even to this day.'"

<span id="an_21:16">21:16</span> Moreover Manasseh shed innocent blood
very much, until he had filled Jerusalem from one end to another;
besides his sin with which he made Judah to sin, in doing that which was
evil in the sight of Yahweh.

<span id="an_21:17">21:17</span> Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh,
and all that he did, and his sin that he sinned, aren't they written in
the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?

<span id="an_21:18">21:18</span> Manasseh slept with his fathers, and
was buried in the garden of his own house, in the garden of Uzza: and
Amon his son reigned in his place.

<span id="an_21:19">21:19</span> Amon was twenty-two years old when he
began to reign; and he reigned two years in Jerusalem: and his mother's
name was Meshullemeth the daughter of Haruz of Jotbah.

<span id="an_21:20">21:20</span> He did that which was evil in the sight
of Yahweh, as did Manasseh his father.

<span id="an_21:21">21:21</span> He walked in all the way that his
father walked in, and served the idols that his father served, and
worshiped them:

<span id="an_21:22">21:22</span> and he forsook Yahweh, the God of his
fathers, and didn't walk in the way of Yahweh.

<span id="an_21:23">21:23</span> The servants of Amon conspired against
him, and put the king to death in his own house.

<span id="an_21:24">21:24</span> But the people of the land killed all
those who had conspired against king Amon; and the people of the land
made Josiah his son king in his place.

<span id="an_21:25">21:25</span> Now the rest of the acts of Amon which
he did, aren't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings
of Judah?

<span id="an_21:26">21:26</span> He was buried in his tomb in the garden
of Uzza: and Josiah his son reigned in his place.

<span id="an_22:1">22:1</span> Josiah was eight years old when he began
to reign; and he reigned thirty-one years in Jerusalem: and his mother's
name was Jedidah the daughter of Adaiah of Bozkath.

<span id="an_22:2">22:2</span> He did that which was right in the eyes
of Yahweh, and walked in all the way of David his father, and didn't
turn aside to the right hand or to the left.

<span id="an_22:3">22:3</span> It happened in the eighteenth year of
king Josiah, that the king sent Shaphan, the son of Azaliah the son of
Meshullam, the scribe, to the house of Yahweh, saying,

<span id="an_22:4">22:4</span> "Go up to Hilkiah the high priest, that
he may sum the money which is brought into the house of Yahweh, which
the keepers of the threshold have gathered of the people.

<span id="an_22:5">22:5</span> Let them deliver it into the hand of the
workmen who have the oversight of the house of Yahweh; and let them give
it to the workmen who are in the house of Yahweh, to repair the breaches
of the house,

<span id="an_22:6">22:6</span> to the carpenters, and to the builders,
and to the masons, and for buying timber and cut stone to repair the
house.

<span id="an_22:7">22:7</span> However there was no accounting made with
them of the money that was delivered into their hand; for they dealt
faithfully."

<span id="an_22:8">22:8</span> Hilkiah the high priest said to Shaphan
the scribe, "I have found the book of the law in the house of Yahweh."
Hilkiah delivered the book to Shaphan, and he read it.

<span id="an_22:9">22:9</span> Shaphan the scribe came to the king, and
brought the king word again, and said, "Your servants have emptied out
the money that was found in the house, and have delivered it into the
hand of the workmen who have the oversight of the house of Yahweh."

<span id="an_22:10">22:10</span> Shaphan the scribe told the king,
saying, "Hilkiah the priest has delivered a book to me." Shaphan read it
before the king.

<span id="an_22:11">22:11</span> It happened, when the king had heard
the words of the book of the law, that he tore his clothes.

<span id="an_22:12">22:12</span> The king commanded Hilkiah the priest,
and Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Achbor the son of Micaiah, and
Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah the king's servant, saying,

<span id="an_22:13">22:13</span> "Go inquire of Yahweh for me, and for
the people, and for all Judah, concerning the words of this book that is
found; for great is the wrath of Yahweh that is kindled against us,
because our fathers have not listened to the words of this book, to do
according to all that which is written concerning us."

<span id="an_22:14">22:14</span> So Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam, and
Achbor, and Shaphan, and Asaiah, went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife
of Shallum the son of Tikvah, the son of Harhas, keeper of the wardrobe
(now she lived in Jerusalem in the second quarter); and they talked with
her.

<span id="an_22:15">22:15</span> She said to them, "Thus says Yahweh,
the God of Israel: 'Tell the man who sent you to me,

<span id="an_22:16">22:16</span> "Thus says Yahweh, 'Behold, I will
bring evil on this place, and on its inhabitants, even all the words of
the book which the king of Judah has read.

<span id="an_22:17">22:17</span> Because they have forsaken me, and have
burned incense to other gods, that they might provoke me to anger with
all the work of their hands, therefore my wrath shall be kindled against
this place, and it shall not be quenched.'"

<span id="an_22:18">22:18</span> But to the king of Judah, who sent you
to inquire of Yahweh, thus you shall tell him, "Thus says Yahweh, the
God of Israel: 'Concerning the words which you have heard,

<span id="an_22:19">22:19</span> because your heart was tender, and you
humbled yourself before Yahweh, when you heard what I spoke against this
place, and against its inhabitants, that they should become a desolation
and a curse, and have torn your clothes, and wept before me; I also have
heard you,' says Yahweh.

<span id="an_22:20">22:20</span> 'Therefore, behold, I will gather you
to your fathers, and you shall be gathered to your grave in peace,
neither shall your eyes see all the evil which I will bring on this
place.'"'" They brought back this message to the king.

<span id="an_23:1">23:1</span> The king sent, and they gathered to him
all the elders of Judah and of Jerusalem.

<span id="an_23:2">23:2</span> The king went up to the house of Yahweh,
and all the men of Judah and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem with him,
and the priests, and the prophets, and all the people, both small and
great: and he read in their ears all the words of the book of the
covenant which was found in the house of Yahweh.

<span id="an_23:3">23:3</span> The king stood by the pillar, and made a
covenant before Yahweh, to walk after Yahweh, and to keep his
commandments, and his testimonies, and his statutes, with all \[his\]
heart, and all \[his\] soul, to confirm the words of this covenant that
were written in this book: and all the people stood to the covenant.

<span id="an_23:4">23:4</span> The king commanded Hilkiah the high
priest, and the priests of the second order, and the keepers of the
threshold, to bring forth out of the temple of Yahweh all the vessels
that were made for Baal, and for the Asherah, and for all the army of
the sky, and he burned them outside of Jerusalem in the fields of the
Kidron, and carried the ashes of them to Bethel.

<span id="an_23:5">23:5</span> He put down the idolatrous priests, whom
the kings of Judah had ordained to burn incense in the high places in
the cities of Judah, and in the places around Jerusalem; those also who
burned incense to Baal, to the sun, and to the moon, and to the planets,
and to all the army of the sky.

<span id="an_23:6">23:6</span> He brought out the Asherah from the house
of Yahweh, outside of Jerusalem, to the brook Kidron, and burned it at
the brook Kidron, and beat it to dust, and cast its dust on the graves
of the common people.

<span id="an_23:7">23:7</span> He broke down the houses of the
sodomites, that were in the house of Yahweh, where the women wove
hangings for the Asherah.

<span id="an_23:8">23:8</span> He brought all the priests out of the
cities of Judah, and defiled the high places where the priests had
burned incense, from Geba to Beersheba; and he broke down the high
places of the gates that were at the entrance of the gate of Joshua the
governor of the city, which were on a man's left hand at the gate of the
city.

<span id="an_23:9">23:9</span> Nevertheless the priests of the high
places didn't come up to the altar of Yahweh in Jerusalem, but they ate
unleavened bread among their brothers.

<span id="an_23:10">23:10</span> He defiled Topheth, which is in the
valley of the children of Hinnom, that no man might make his son or his
daughter to pass through the fire to Molech.

<span id="an_23:11">23:11</span> He took away the horses that the kings
of Judah had given to the sun, at the entrance of the house of Yahweh,
by the room of Nathan Melech the officer, who was in the court; and he
burned the chariots of the sun with fire.

<span id="an_23:12">23:12</span> The altars that were on the roof of the
upper room of Ahaz, which the kings of Judah had made, and the altars
which Manasseh had made in the two courts of the house of Yahweh, did
the king break down, and beat \[them\] down from there, and cast the
dust of them into the brook Kidron.

<span id="an_23:13">23:13</span> The high places that were before
Jerusalem, which were on the right hand of the mountain of corruption,
which Solomon the king of Israel had built for Ashtoreth the abomination
of the Sidonians, and for Chemosh the abomination of Moab, and for
Milcom the abomination of the children of Ammon, did the king defile.

<span id="an_23:14">23:14</span> He broke in pieces the pillars, and cut
down the Asherim, and filled their places with the bones of men.

<span id="an_23:15">23:15</span> Moreover the altar that was at Bethel,
and the high place which Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to
sin, had made, even that altar and the high place he broke down; and he
burned the high place and beat it to dust, and burned the Asherah.

<span id="an_23:16">23:16</span> As Josiah turned himself, he spied the
tombs that were there in the mountain; and he sent, and took the bones
out of the tombs, and burned them on the altar, and defiled it,
according to the word of Yahweh which the man of God proclaimed, who
proclaimed these things.

<span id="an_23:17">23:17</span> Then he said, "What monument is that
which I see?" The men of the city told him, "It is the tomb of the man
of God, who came from Judah, and proclaimed these things that you have
done against the altar of Bethel."

<span id="an_23:18">23:18</span> He said, "Let him be! Let no man move
his bones." So they let his bones alone, with the bones of the prophet
who came out of Samaria.

<span id="an_23:19">23:19</span> All the houses also of the high places
that were in the cities of Samaria, which the kings of Israel had made
to provoke \[Yahweh\] to anger, Josiah took away, and did to them
according to all the acts that he had done in Bethel.

<span id="an_23:20">23:20</span> He killed all the priests of the high
places that were there, on the altars, and burned men's bones on them;
and he returned to Jerusalem.

<span id="an_23:21">23:21</span> The king commanded all the people,
saying, "Keep the Passover to Yahweh your God, as it is written in this
book of the covenant."

<span id="an_23:22">23:22</span> Surely there was not kept such a
Passover from the days of the judges who judged Israel, nor in all the
days of the kings of Israel, nor of the kings of Judah;

<span id="an_23:23">23:23</span> but in the eighteenth year of king
Josiah was this Passover kept to Yahweh in Jerusalem.

<span id="an_23:24">23:24</span> Moreover those who had familiar
spirits, and the wizards, and the teraphim, and the idols, and all the
abominations that were seen in the land of Judah and in Jerusalem, did
Josiah put away, that he might confirm the words of the law which were
written in the book that Hilkiah the priest found in the house of
Yahweh.

<span id="an_23:25">23:25</span> Like him was there no king before him,
who turned to Yahweh with all his heart, and with all his soul, and with
all his might, according to all the law of Moses; neither after him
arose there any like him.

<span id="an_23:26">23:26</span> Notwithstanding, Yahweh didn't turn
from the fierceness of his great wrath, with which his anger was kindled
against Judah, because of all the provocation with which Manasseh had
provoked him.

<span id="an_23:27">23:27</span> Yahweh said, "I will remove Judah also
out of my sight, as I have removed Israel, and I will cast off this city
which I have chosen, even Jerusalem, and the house of which I said, 'My
name shall be there.'"

<span id="an_23:28">23:28</span> Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and
all that he did, aren't they written in the book of the chronicles of
the kings of Judah?

<span id="an_23:29">23:29</span> In his days Pharaoh Necoh king of Egypt
went up against the king of Assyria to the river Euphrates: and king
Josiah went against him; and \[Pharaoh Necoh\] killed him at Megiddo,
when he had seen him.

<span id="an_23:30">23:30</span> His servants carried him in a chariot
dead from Megiddo, and brought him to Jerusalem, and buried him in his
own tomb. The people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah, and
anointed him, and made him king in his father's place.

<span id="an_23:31">23:31</span> Jehoahaz was twenty-three years old
when he began to reign; and he reigned three months in Jerusalem: and
his mother's name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.

<span id="an_23:32">23:32</span> He did that which was evil in the sight
of Yahweh, according to all that his fathers had done.

<span id="an_23:33">23:33</span> Pharaoh Necoh put him in bonds at
Riblah in the land of Hamath, that he might not reign in Jerusalem; and
put the land to a tribute of one hundred talents of silver, and a talent
of gold.

<span id="an_23:34">23:34</span> Pharaoh Necoh made Eliakim the son of
Josiah king in the place of Josiah his father, and changed his name to
Jehoiakim: but he took Jehoahaz away; and he came to Egypt, and died
there.

<span id="an_23:35">23:35</span> Jehoiakim gave the silver and the gold
to Pharaoh; but he taxed the land to give the money according to the
commandment of Pharaoh: he exacted the silver and the gold of the people
of the land, of everyone according to his taxation, to give it to
Pharaoh Necoh.

<span id="an_23:36">23:36</span> Jehoiakim was twenty-five years old
when he began to reign; and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem: and
his mother's name was Zebidah the daughter of Pedaiah of Rumah.

<span id="an_23:37">23:37</span> He did that which was evil in the sight
of Yahweh, according to all that his fathers had done.

<span id="an_24:1">24:1</span> In his days Nebuchadnezzar king of
Babylon came up, and Jehoiakim became his servant three years: then he
turned and rebelled against him.

<span id="an_24:2">24:2</span> Yahweh sent against him bands of the
Chaldeans, and bands of the Syrians, and bands of the Moabites, and
bands of the children of Ammon, and sent them against Judah to destroy
it, according to the word of Yahweh, which he spoke by his servants the
prophets.

<span id="an_24:3">24:3</span> Surely at the commandment of Yahweh came
this on Judah, to remove them out of his sight, for the sins of
Manasseh, according to all that he did,

<span id="an_24:4">24:4</span> and also for the innocent blood that he
shed; for he filled Jerusalem with innocent blood: and Yahweh would not
pardon.

<span id="an_24:5">24:5</span> Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim,
and all that he did, aren't they written in the book of the chronicles
of the kings of Judah?

<span id="an_24:6">24:6</span> So Jehoiakim slept with his fathers; and
Jehoiachin his son reigned in his place.

<span id="an_24:7">24:7</span> The king of Egypt didn't come again out
of his land any more; for the king of Babylon had taken, from the brook
of Egypt to the river Euphrates, all that pertained to the king of
Egypt.

<span id="an_24:8">24:8</span> Jehoiachin was eighteen years old when he
began to reign; and he reigned in Jerusalem three months: and his
mother's name was Nehushta the daughter of Elnathan of Jerusalem.

<span id="an_24:9">24:9</span> He did that which was evil in the sight
of Yahweh, according to all that his father had done.

<span id="an_24:10">24:10</span> At that time the servants of
Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up to Jerusalem, and the city was
besieged.

<span id="an_24:11">24:11</span> Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came to
the city, while his servants were besieging it;

<span id="an_24:12">24:12</span> and Jehoiachin the king of Judah went
out to the king of Babylon, he, and his mother, and his servants, and
his princes, and his officers: and the king of Babylon took him in the
eighth year of his reign.

<span id="an_24:13">24:13</span> He carried out there all the treasures
of the house of Yahweh, and the treasures of the king's house, and cut
in pieces all the vessels of gold, which Solomon king of Israel had made
in the temple of Yahweh, as Yahweh had said.

<span id="an_24:14">24:14</span> He carried away all Jerusalem, and all
the princes, and all the mighty men of valor, even ten thousand
captives, and all the craftsmen and the smiths; none remained, except
the poorest sort of the people of the land.

<span id="an_24:15">24:15</span> He carried away Jehoiachin to Babylon;
and the king's mother, and the king's wives, and his officers, and the
chief men of the land, carried he into captivity from Jerusalem to
Babylon.

<span id="an_24:16">24:16</span> All the men of might, even seven
thousand, and the craftsmen and the smiths one thousand, all of them
strong and apt for war, even them the king of Babylon brought captive to
Babylon.

<span id="an_24:17">24:17</span> The king of Babylon made Mattaniah,
\[Jehoiachin's\] father's brother, king is his place, and changed his
name to Zedekiah.

<span id="an_24:18">24:18</span> Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when
he began to reign; and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem: and his
mother's name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.

<span id="an_24:19">24:19</span> He did that which was evil in the sight
of Yahweh, according to all that Jehoiakim had done.

<span id="an_24:20">24:20</span> For through the anger of Yahweh did it
happen in Jerusalem and Judah, until he had cast them out from his
presence. Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.

<span id="an_25:1">25:1</span> It happened in the ninth year of his
reign, in the tenth month, in the tenth day of the month, that
Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came, he and all his army, against
Jerusalem, and encamped against it; and they built forts against it
around it.

<span id="an_25:2">25:2</span> So the city was besieged to the eleventh
year of king Zedekiah.

<span id="an_25:3">25:3</span> On the ninth day of the \[fourth\] month
the famine was severe in the city, so that there was no bread for the
people of the land.

<span id="an_25:4">25:4</span> Then a breach was made in the city, and
all the men of war \[fled\] by night by the way of the gate between the
two walls, which was by the king's garden (now the Chaldeans were
against the city around it); and \[the king\] went by the way of the
Arabah.

<span id="an_25:5">25:5</span> But the army of the Chaldeans pursued
after the king, and overtook him in the plains of Jericho; and all his
army was scattered from him.

<span id="an_25:6">25:6</span> Then they took the king, and carried him
up to the king of Babylon to Riblah; and they gave judgment on him.

<span id="an_25:7">25:7</span> They killed the sons of Zedekiah before
his eyes, and put out the eyes of Zedekiah, and bound him in fetters,
and carried him to Babylon.

<span id="an_25:8">25:8</span> Now in the fifth month, on the seventh
day of the month, which was the nineteenth year of king Nebuchadnezzar,
king of Babylon, came Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard, a servant of
the king of Babylon, to Jerusalem.

<span id="an_25:9">25:9</span> He burnt the house of Yahweh, and the
king's house; and all the houses of Jerusalem, even every great house,
burnt he with fire.

<span id="an_25:10">25:10</span> All the army of the Chaldeans, who were
\[with\] the captain of the guard, broke down the walls around
Jerusalem.

<span id="an_25:11">25:11</span> The residue of the people who were left
in the city, and those who fell away, who fell to the king of Babylon,
and the residue of the multitude, did Nebuzaradan the captain of the
guard carry away captive.

<span id="an_25:12">25:12</span> But the captain of the guard left of
the poorest of the land to work the vineyards and fields.

<span id="an_25:13">25:13</span> The pillars of brass that were in the
house of Yahweh, and the bases and the bronze sea that were in the house
of Yahweh, did the Chaldeans break in pieces, and carried the brass of
them to Babylon.

<span id="an_25:14">25:14</span> The pots, and the shovels, and the
snuffers, and the spoons, and all the vessels of brass with which they
ministered, took they away.

<span id="an_25:15">25:15</span> The fire pans, and the basins, that
which was of gold, in gold, and that which was of silver, in silver, the
captain of the guard took away.

<span id="an_25:16">25:16</span> The two pillars, the one sea, and the
bases, which Solomon had made for the house of Yahweh, the brass of all
these vessels was without weight.

<span id="an_25:17">25:17</span> The height of the one pillar was
eighteen cubits, and a capital of brass was on it; and the height of the
capital was three cubits, with network and pomegranates on the capital
around it, all of brass: and like to these had the second pillar with
network.

<span id="an_25:18">25:18</span> The captain of the guard took Seraiah
the chief priest, and Zephaniah the second priest, and the three keepers
of the threshold:

<span id="an_25:19">25:19</span> and out of the city he took an officer
who was set over the men of war; and five men of those who saw the
king's face, who were found in the city; and the scribe, the captain of
the army, who mustered the people of the land; and sixty men of the
people of the land, who were found in the city.

<span id="an_25:20">25:20</span> Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard
took them, and brought them to the king of Babylon to Riblah.

<span id="an_25:21">25:21</span> The king of Babylon struck them, and
put them to death at Riblah in the land of Hamath. So Judah was carried
away captive out of his land.

<span id="an_25:22">25:22</span> As for the people who were left in the
land of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had left, even over
them he made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, governor.

<span id="an_25:23">25:23</span> Now when all the captains of the
forces, they and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had made
Gedaliah governor, they came to Gedaliah to Mizpah, even Ishmael the son
of Nethaniah, and Johanan the son of Kareah, and Seraiah the son of
Tanhumeth the Netophathite, and Jaazaniah the son of the Maacathite,
they and their men.

<span id="an_25:24">25:24</span> Gedaliah swore to them and to their
men, and said to them, "Don't be afraid because of the servants of the
Chaldeans. Dwell in the land, and serve the king of Babylon, and it
shall be well with you."

<span id="an_25:25">25:25</span> But it happened in the seventh month,
that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, of the royal
seed came, and ten men with him, and struck Gedaliah, so that he died,
and the Jews and the Chaldeans that were with him at Mizpah.

<span id="an_25:26">25:26</span> All the people, both small and great,
and the captains of the forces, arose, and came to Egypt; for they were
afraid of the Chaldeans.

<span id="an_25:27">25:27</span> It happened in the seven and thirtieth
year of the captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month,
on the seven and twentieth day of the month, that Evilmerodach king of
Babylon, in the year that he began to reign, did lift up the head of
Jehoiachin king of Judah out of prison;

<span id="an_25:28">25:28</span> and he spoke kindly to him, and set his
throne above the throne of the kings who were with him in Babylon,

<span id="an_25:29">25:29</span> and changed his prison garments.
\[Jehoiachin\] ate bread before him continually all the days of his
life:

<span id="an_25:30">25:30</span> and for his allowance, there was a
continual allowance given him of the king, every day a portion, all the
days of his life.
