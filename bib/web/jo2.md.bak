### World English Bible: 2 John

<span id="an_1:1">1:1</span> The elder, to the chosen lady and her
children, whom I love in truth; and not I only, but also all those who
know the truth;

<span id="an_1:2">1:2</span> for the truth's sake, which remains in us,
and it will be with us forever:

<span id="an_1:3">1:3</span> Grace, mercy, and peace will be with us,
from God the Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the
Father, in truth and love.

<span id="an_1:4">1:4</span> I rejoice greatly that I have found some of
your children walking in truth, even as we have been commanded by the
Father.

<span id="an_1:5">1:5</span> Now I beg you, dear lady, not as though I
wrote to you a new commandment, but that which we had from the
beginning, that we love one another.

<span id="an_1:6">1:6</span> This is love, that we should walk according
to his commandments. This is the commandment, even as you heard from the
beginning, that you should walk in it.

<span id="an_1:7">1:7</span> For many deceivers have gone out into the
world, those who don't confess that Jesus Christ came in the flesh. This
is the deceiver and the Antichrist.

<span id="an_1:8">1:8</span> Watch yourselves, that we don't lose the
things which we have accomplished, but that we receive a full reward.

<span id="an_1:9">1:9</span> Whoever transgresses and doesn't remain in
the teaching of Christ, doesn't have God. He who remains in the
teaching, the same has both the Father and the Son.

<span id="an_1:10">1:10</span> If anyone comes to you, and doesn't bring
this teaching, don't receive him into your house, and don't welcome him,

<span id="an_1:11">1:11</span> for he who welcomes him participates in
his evil works.

<span id="an_1:12">1:12</span> Having many things to write to you, I
don't want to do so with paper and ink, but I hope to come to you, and
to speak face to face, that our joy may be made full.

<span id="an_1:13">1:13</span> The children of your chosen sister greet
you. Amen.
