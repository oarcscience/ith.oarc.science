### World English Bible: Haggai

<span id="an_1:1">1:1</span> In the second year of Darius the king, in
the sixth month, in the first day of the month, the Word of Yahweh came
by Haggai, the prophet, to Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, governor of
Judah, and to Joshua, the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, saying,

<span id="an_1:2">1:2</span> "This is what Yahweh of Armies says: These
people say, 'The time hasn't yet come, the time for Yahweh's house to be
built.'"

<span id="an_1:3">1:3</span> Then the Word of Yahweh came by Haggai, the
prophet, saying,

<span id="an_1:4">1:4</span> "Is it a time for you yourselves to dwell
in your paneled houses, while this house lies waste?

<span id="an_1:5">1:5</span> Now therefore this is what Yahweh of Armies
says: Consider your ways.

<span id="an_1:6">1:6</span> You have sown much, and bring in little.
You eat, but you don't have enough. You drink, but you aren't filled
with drink. You clothe yourselves, but no one is warm, and he who earns
wages earns wages to put them into a bag with holes in it."

<span id="an_1:7">1:7</span> This is what Yahweh of Armies says:
"Consider your ways.

<span id="an_1:8">1:8</span> Go up to the mountain, bring wood, and
build the house. I will take pleasure in it, and I will be glorified,"
says Yahweh.

<span id="an_1:9">1:9</span> "You looked for much, and, behold, it came
to little; and when you brought it home, I blew it away. Why?" says
Yahweh of Armies, "Because of my house that lies waste, while each of
you is busy with his own house.

<span id="an_1:10">1:10</span> Therefore for your sake the heavens
withhold the dew, and the earth withholds its fruit.

<span id="an_1:11">1:11</span> I called for a drought on the land, on
the mountains, on the grain, on the new wine, on the oil, on that which
the ground brings forth, on men, on livestock, and on all the labor of
the hands."

<span id="an_1:12">1:12</span> Then Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel,
and Joshua, the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, with all the remnant
of the people, obeyed the voice of Yahweh, their God, and the words of
Haggai, the prophet, as Yahweh, their God, had sent him; and the people
feared Yahweh.

<span id="an_1:13">1:13</span> Then Haggai, Yahweh's messenger, spoke
Yahweh's message to the people, saying, "I am with you," says Yahweh.

<span id="an_1:14">1:14</span> Yahweh stirred up the spirit of
Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and the spirit of
Joshua, the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and the spirit of all the
remnant of the people; and they came and worked on the house of Yahweh
of Armies, their God,

<span id="an_1:15">1:15</span> in the twenty-fourth day of the month, in
the sixth month, in the second year of Darius the king.

<span id="an_2:1">2:1</span> In the seventh month, in the twenty-first
day of the month, the Word of Yahweh came by Haggai the prophet, saying,

<span id="an_2:2">2:2</span> "Speak now to Zerubbabel, the son of
Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua, the son of Jehozadak, the
high priest, and to the remnant of the people, saying,

<span id="an_2:3">2:3</span> 'Who is left among you who saw this house
in its former glory? How do you see it now? Isn't it in your eyes as
nothing?

<span id="an_2:4">2:4</span> Yet now be strong, Zerubbabel,' says
Yahweh. 'Be strong, Joshua, son of Jehozadak, the high priest. Be
strong, all you people of the land,' says Yahweh, 'and work, for I am
with you,' says Yahweh of Armies.

<span id="an_2:5">2:5</span> This is the word that I covenanted with you
when you came out of Egypt, and my Spirit lived among you. 'Don't be
afraid.'

<span id="an_2:6">2:6</span> For this is what Yahweh of Armies says:
'Yet once, it is a little while, and I will shake the heavens, the
earth, the sea, and the dry land;

<span id="an_2:7">2:7</span> and I will shake all nations. The precious
things of all nations will come, and I will fill this house with glory,
says Yahweh of Armies.

<span id="an_2:8">2:8</span> The silver is mine, and the gold is mine,'
says Yahweh of Armies.

<span id="an_2:9">2:9</span> 'The latter glory of this house will be
greater than the former,' says Yahweh of Armies; 'and in this place will
I give peace,' says Yahweh of Armies."

<span id="an_2:10">2:10</span> In the twenty-fourth day of the ninth
month, in the second year of Darius, the Word of Yahweh came by Haggai
the prophet, saying,

<span id="an_2:11">2:11</span> "Thus says Yahweh of Armies: Ask now the
priests concerning the law, saying,

<span id="an_2:12">2:12</span> 'If someone carries holy meat in the fold
of his garment, and with his fold touches bread, stew, wine, oil, or any
food, will it become holy?'" The priests answered, "No."

<span id="an_2:13">2:13</span> Then Haggai said, "If one who is unclean
by reason of a dead body touch any of these, will it be unclean?" The
priests answered, "It will be unclean."

<span id="an_2:14">2:14</span> Then Haggai answered, "'So is this
people, and so is this nation before me,' says Yahweh; 'and so is every
work of their hands. That which they offer there is unclean.

<span id="an_2:15">2:15</span> Now, please consider from this day and
backward, before a stone was laid on a stone in the temple of Yahweh.

<span id="an_2:16">2:16</span> Through all that time, when one came to a
heap of twenty measures, there were only ten. When one came to the wine
vat to draw out fifty, there were only twenty.

<span id="an_2:17">2:17</span> I struck you with blight, mildew, and
hail in all the work of your hands; yet you didn't turn to me,' says
Yahweh.

<span id="an_2:18">2:18</span> 'Consider, please, from this day and
backward, from the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month, since the day
that the foundation of Yahweh's temple was laid, consider it.

<span id="an_2:19">2:19</span> Is the seed yet in the barn? Yes, the
vine, the fig tree, the pomegranate, and the olive tree haven't brought
forth. From this day will I bless you.'"

<span id="an_2:20">2:20</span> The Word of Yahweh came the second time
to Haggai in the twenty-fourth day of the month, saying,

<span id="an_2:21">2:21</span> "Speak to Zerubbabel, governor of Judah,
saying, 'I will shake the heavens and the earth.

<span id="an_2:22">2:22</span> I will overthrow the throne of kingdoms.
I will destroy the strength of the kingdoms of the nations. I will
overthrow the chariots, and those who ride in them. The horses and their
riders will come down, everyone by the sword of his brother.

<span id="an_2:23">2:23</span> In that day, says Yahweh of Armies, will
I take you, Zerubbabel, my servant, the son of Shealtiel,' says Yahweh,
'and will make you as a signet, for I have chosen you,' says Yahweh of
Armies."
