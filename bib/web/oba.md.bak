### World English Bible: Obadiah

<span id="an_1:1">1:1</span> The vision of Obadiah. This is what the
Lord Yahweh says about Edom. We have heard news from Yahweh, and an
ambassador is sent among the nations, saying, "Arise, and let's rise up
against her in battle.

<span id="an_1:2">1:2</span> Behold, I have made you small among the
nations. You are greatly despised.

<span id="an_1:3">1:3</span> The pride of your heart has deceived you,
you who dwell in the clefts of the rock, whose habitation is high, who
says in his heart, 'Who will bring me down to the ground?'

<span id="an_1:4">1:4</span> Though you mount on high as the eagle, and
though your nest is set among the stars, I will bring you down from
there," says Yahweh.

<span id="an_1:5">1:5</span> "If thieves came to you, if robbers by
night--oh, what disaster awaits you--wouldn't they only steal until they
had enough? If grape pickers came to you, wouldn't they leave some
gleaning grapes?

<span id="an_1:6">1:6</span> How Esau will be ransacked! How his hidden
treasures are sought out!

<span id="an_1:7">1:7</span> All the men of your alliance have brought
you on your way, even to the border. The men who were at peace with you
have deceived you, and prevailed against you. Friends who eat your bread
lay a snare under you. There is no understanding in him."

<span id="an_1:8">1:8</span> "Won't I in that day," says Yahweh,
"destroy the wise men out of Edom, and understanding out of the mountain
of Esau?

<span id="an_1:9">1:9</span> Your mighty men, Teman, will be dismayed,
to the end that everyone may be cut off from the mountain of Esau by
slaughter.

<span id="an_1:10">1:10</span> For the violence done to your brother
Jacob, shame will cover you, and you will be cut off forever.

<span id="an_1:11">1:11</span> In the day that you stood on the other
side, in the day that strangers carried away his substance, and
foreigners entered into his gates, and cast lots for Jerusalem, even you
were like one of them.

<span id="an_1:12">1:12</span> But don't look down on your brother in
the day of his disaster, and don't rejoice over the children of Judah in
the day of their destruction. Don't speak proudly in the day of
distress.

<span id="an_1:13">1:13</span> Don't enter into the gate of my people in
the day of their calamity. Don't look down on their affliction in the
day of their calamity, neither seize their wealth on the day of their
calamity.

<span id="an_1:14">1:14</span> Don't stand in the crossroads to cut off
those of his who escape. Don't deliver up those of his who remain in the
day of distress.

<span id="an_1:15">1:15</span> For the day of Yahweh is near all the
nations! As you have done, it will be done to you. Your deeds will
return upon your own head.

<span id="an_1:16">1:16</span> For as you have drunk on my holy
mountain, so will all the nations drink continually. Yes, they will
drink, swallow down, and will be as though they had not been.

<span id="an_1:17">1:17</span> But in Mount Zion, there will be those
who escape, and it will be holy. The house of Jacob will possess their
possessions.

<span id="an_1:18">1:18</span> The house of Jacob will be a fire, the
house of Joseph a flame, and the house of Esau for stubble. They will
burn among them, and devour them. There will not be any remaining to the
house of Esau." Indeed, Yahweh has spoken.

<span id="an_1:19">1:19</span> Those of the South will possess the
mountain of Esau, and those of the lowland, the Philistines. They will
possess the field of Ephraim, and the field of Samaria. Benjamin will
possess Gilead.

<span id="an_1:20">1:20</span> The captives of this army of the children
of Israel, who are among the Canaanites, will possess even to Zarephath;
and the captives of Jerusalem, who are in Sepharad, will possess the
cities of the Negev.

<span id="an_1:21">1:21</span> Saviors will go up on Mount Zion to judge
the mountains of Esau, and the kingdom will be Yahweh's.
