### World English Bible: 2 Timothy

<span id="an_1:1">1:1</span> Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ through
the will of God, according to the promise of the life which is in Christ
Jesus,

<span id="an_1:2">1:2</span> to Timothy, my beloved child: Grace, mercy,
and peace, from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.

<span id="an_1:3">1:3</span> I thank God, whom I serve as my forefathers
did, with a pure conscience. How unceasing is my memory of you in my
petitions, night and day

<span id="an_1:4">1:4</span> longing to see you, remembering your tears,
that I may be filled with joy;

<span id="an_1:5">1:5</span> having been reminded of the sincere faith
that is in you; which lived first in your grandmother Lois, and your
mother Eunice, and, I am persuaded, in you also.

<span id="an_1:6">1:6</span> For this cause, I remind you that you
should stir up the gift of God which is in you through the laying on of
my hands.

<span id="an_1:7">1:7</span> For God didn't give us a spirit of fear,
but of power, love, and self-control.

<span id="an_1:8">1:8</span> Therefore don't be ashamed of the testimony
of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner; but endure hardship for the Good
News according to the power of God,

<span id="an_1:9">1:9</span> who saved us and called us with a holy
calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose
and grace, which was given to us in Christ Jesus before times eternal,

<span id="an_1:10">1:10</span> but has now been revealed by the
appearing of our Savior, Christ Jesus, who abolished death, and brought
life and immortality to light through the Good News.

<span id="an_1:11">1:11</span> For this, I was appointed as a preacher,
an apostle, and a teacher of the Gentiles.

<span id="an_1:12">1:12</span> For this cause I also suffer these
things. Yet I am not ashamed, for I know him whom I have believed, and I
am persuaded that he is able to guard that which I have committed to him
against that day.

<span id="an_1:13">1:13</span> Hold the pattern of sound words which you
have heard from me, in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.

<span id="an_1:14">1:14</span> That good thing which was committed to
you, guard through the Holy Spirit who dwells in us.

<span id="an_1:15">1:15</span> This you know, that all who are in Asia
turned away from me; of whom are Phygelus and Hermogenes.

<span id="an_1:16">1:16</span> May the Lord grant mercy to the house of
Onesiphorus, for he often refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain,

<span id="an_1:17">1:17</span> but when he was in Rome, he sought me
diligently, and found me

<span id="an_1:18">1:18</span> (the Lord grant to him to find the Lord's
mercy in that day); and in how many things he served at Ephesus, you
know very well.

<span id="an_2:1">2:1</span> You therefore, my child, be strengthened in
the grace that is in Christ Jesus.

<span id="an_2:2">2:2</span> The things which you have heard from me
among many witnesses, commit the same to faithful men, who will be able
to teach others also.

<span id="an_2:3">2:3</span> You therefore must endure hardship, as a
good soldier of Christ Jesus.

<span id="an_2:4">2:4</span> No soldier on duty entangles himself in the
affairs of life, that he may please him who enrolled him as a soldier.

<span id="an_2:5">2:5</span> Also, if anyone competes in athletics, he
isn't crowned unless he has competed by the rules.

<span id="an_2:6">2:6</span> The farmers who labor must be the first to
get a share of the crops.

<span id="an_2:7">2:7</span> Consider what I say, and may the Lord give
you understanding in all things.

<span id="an_2:8">2:8</span> Remember Jesus Christ, risen from the dead,
of the seed of David, according to my Good News,

<span id="an_2:9">2:9</span> in which I suffer hardship to the point of
chains as a criminal. But God's word isn't chained.

<span id="an_2:10">2:10</span> Therefore I endure all things for the
chosen ones' sake, that they also may obtain the salvation which is in
Christ Jesus with eternal glory.

<span id="an_2:11">2:11</span> This saying is faithful: "For if we died
with him, we will also live with him.

<span id="an_2:12">2:12</span> If we endure, we will also reign with
him. If we deny him, he also will deny us.

<span id="an_2:13">2:13</span> If we are faithless, he remains faithful.
He can't deny himself."

<span id="an_2:14">2:14</span> Remind them of these things, charging
them in the sight of the Lord, that they don't argue about words, to no
profit, to the subverting of those who hear.

<span id="an_2:15">2:15</span> Give diligence to present yourself
approved by God, a workman who doesn't need to be ashamed, properly
handling the Word of Truth.

<span id="an_2:16">2:16</span> But shun empty chatter, for they will
proceed further in ungodliness,

<span id="an_2:17">2:17</span> and their word will consume like
gangrene, of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus;

<span id="an_2:18">2:18</span> men who have erred concerning the truth,
saying that the resurrection is already past, and overthrowing the faith
of some.

<span id="an_2:19">2:19</span> However God's firm foundation stands,
having this seal, "The Lord knows those who are his," and, "Let every
one who names the name of the Lord depart from unrighteousness."

<span id="an_2:20">2:20</span> Now in a large house there are not only
vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of clay. Some are
for honor, and some for dishonor.

<span id="an_2:21">2:21</span> If anyone therefore purges himself from
these, he will be a vessel for honor, sanctified, and suitable for the
master's use, prepared for every good work.

<span id="an_2:22">2:22</span> Flee from youthful lusts; but pursue
righteousness, faith, love, and peace with those who call on the Lord
out of a pure heart.

<span id="an_2:23">2:23</span> But refuse foolish and ignorant
questionings, knowing that they generate strife.

<span id="an_2:24">2:24</span> The Lord's servant must not quarrel, but
be gentle towards all, able to teach, patient,

<span id="an_2:25">2:25</span> in gentleness correcting those who oppose
him: perhaps God may give them repentance leading to a full knowledge of
the truth,

<span id="an_2:26">2:26</span> and they may recover themselves out of
the devil's snare, having been taken captive by him to his will.

<span id="an_3:1">3:1</span> But know this, that in the last days,
grievous times will come.

<span id="an_3:2">3:2</span> For men will be lovers of self, lovers of
money, boastful, arrogant, blasphemers, disobedient to parents,
unthankful, unholy,

<span id="an_3:3">3:3</span> without natural affection, unforgiving,
slanderers, without self-control, fierce, no lovers of good,

<span id="an_3:4">3:4</span> traitors, headstrong, conceited, lovers of
pleasure rather than lovers of God;

<span id="an_3:5">3:5</span> holding a form of godliness, but having
denied its power. Turn away from these, also.

<span id="an_3:6">3:6</span> For some of these are people who creep into
houses, and take captive gullible women loaded down with sins, led away
by various lusts,

<span id="an_3:7">3:7</span> always learning, and never able to come to
the knowledge of the truth.

<span id="an_3:8">3:8</span> Even as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses,
so do these also oppose the truth; men corrupted in mind, who concerning
the faith, are rejected.

<span id="an_3:9">3:9</span> But they will proceed no further. For their
folly will be evident to all men, as theirs also came to be.

<span id="an_3:10">3:10</span> But you did follow my teaching, conduct,
purpose, faith, patience, love, steadfastness,

<span id="an_3:11">3:11</span> persecutions, and sufferings: those
things that happened to me at Antioch, Iconium, and Lystra. I endured
those persecutions. Out of them all the Lord delivered me.

<span id="an_3:12">3:12</span> Yes, and all who desire to live godly in
Christ Jesus will suffer persecution.

<span id="an_3:13">3:13</span> But evil men and impostors will grow
worse and worse, deceiving and being deceived.

<span id="an_3:14">3:14</span> But you remain in the things which you
have learned and have been assured of, knowing from whom you have
learned them.

<span id="an_3:15">3:15</span> From infancy, you have known the holy
Scriptures which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith,
which is in Christ Jesus.

<span id="an_3:16">3:16</span> Every Scripture is God-breathed and
profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for
instruction in righteousness,

<span id="an_3:17">3:17</span> that the man of God may be complete,
thoroughly equipped for every good work.

<span id="an_4:1">4:1</span> I command you therefore before God and the
Lord Jesus Christ, who will judge the living and the dead at his
appearing and his Kingdom:

<span id="an_4:2">4:2</span> preach the word; be urgent in season and
out of season; reprove, rebuke, and exhort, with all patience and
teaching.

<span id="an_4:3">4:3</span> For the time will come when they will not
listen to the sound doctrine, but, having itching ears, will heap up for
themselves teachers after their own lusts;

<span id="an_4:4">4:4</span> and will turn away their ears from the
truth, and turn aside to fables.

<span id="an_4:5">4:5</span> But you be sober in all things, suffer
hardship, do the work of an evangelist, and fulfill your ministry.

<span id="an_4:6">4:6</span> For I am already being offered, and the
time of my departure has come.

<span id="an_4:7">4:7</span> I have fought the good fight. I have
finished the course. I have kept the faith.

<span id="an_4:8">4:8</span> From now on, there is stored up for me the
crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, will give
to me on that day; and not to me only, but also to all those who have
loved his appearing.

<span id="an_4:9">4:9</span> Be diligent to come to me soon,

<span id="an_4:10">4:10</span> for Demas left me, having loved this
present world, and went to Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia, and Titus
to Dalmatia.

<span id="an_4:11">4:11</span> Only Luke is with me. Take Mark, and
bring him with you, for he is useful to me for service.

<span id="an_4:12">4:12</span> But I sent Tychicus to Ephesus.

<span id="an_4:13">4:13</span> Bring the cloak that I left at Troas with
Carpus when you come, and the books, especially the parchments.

<span id="an_4:14">4:14</span> Alexander, the coppersmith, did much evil
to me. The Lord will repay him according to his works,

<span id="an_4:15">4:15</span> of whom you also must beware; for he
greatly opposed our words.

<span id="an_4:16">4:16</span> At my first defense, no one came to help
me, but all left me. May it not be held against them.

<span id="an_4:17">4:17</span> But the Lord stood by me, and
strengthened me, that through me the message might be fully proclaimed,
and that all the Gentiles might hear; and I was delivered out of the
mouth of the lion.

<span id="an_4:18">4:18</span> And the Lord will deliver me from every
evil work, and will preserve me for his heavenly Kingdom; to whom be the
glory forever and ever. Amen.

<span id="an_4:19">4:19</span> Greet Prisca and Aquila, and the house of
Onesiphorus.

<span id="an_4:20">4:20</span> Erastus remained at Corinth, but I left
Trophimus at Miletus sick.

<span id="an_4:21">4:21</span> Be diligent to come before winter.
Eubulus salutes you, as do Pudens, Linus, Claudia, and all the brothers.

<span id="an_4:22">4:22</span> The Lord Jesus Christ be with your
spirit. Grace be with you. Amen.
