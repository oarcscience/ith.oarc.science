### World English Bible: Mark

<span id="an_1:1">1:1</span> The beginning of the Good News of Jesus
Christ, the Son of God.

<span id="an_1:2">1:2</span> As it is written in the prophets, "Behold,
I send my messenger before your face, who will prepare your way before
you.

<span id="an_1:3">1:3</span> The voice of one crying in the wilderness,
'Make ready the way of the Lord! Make his paths straight!'"

<span id="an_1:4">1:4</span> John came baptizing in the wilderness and
preaching the baptism of repentance for forgiveness of sins.

<span id="an_1:5">1:5</span> All the country of Judea and all those of
Jerusalem went out to him. They were baptized by him in the Jordan
river, confessing their sins.

<span id="an_1:6">1:6</span> John was clothed with camel's hair and a
leather belt around his waist. He ate locusts and wild honey.

<span id="an_1:7">1:7</span> He preached, saying, "After me comes he who
is mightier than I, the thong of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop
down and loosen.

<span id="an_1:8">1:8</span> I baptized you in water, but he will
baptize you in the Holy Spirit."

<span id="an_1:9">1:9</span> It happened in those days, that Jesus came
from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized by John in the Jordan.

<span id="an_1:10">1:10</span> Immediately coming up from the water, he
saw the heavens parting, and the Spirit descending on him like a dove.

<span id="an_1:11">1:11</span> A voice came out of the sky, "You are my
beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased."

<span id="an_1:12">1:12</span> Immediately the Spirit drove him out into
the wilderness.

<span id="an_1:13">1:13</span> He was there in the wilderness forty days
tempted by Satan. He was with the wild animals; and the angels were
serving him.

<span id="an_1:14">1:14</span> Now after John was taken into custody,
Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the Good News of the Kingdom of God,

<span id="an_1:15">1:15</span> and saying, "The time is fulfilled, and
the Kingdom of God is at hand! Repent, and believe in the Good News."

<span id="an_1:16">1:16</span> Passing along by the sea of Galilee, he
saw Simon and Andrew the brother of Simon casting a net into the sea,
for they were fishermen.

<span id="an_1:17">1:17</span> Jesus said to them, "Come after me, and I
will make you into fishers for men."

<span id="an_1:18">1:18</span> Immediately they left their nets, and
followed him.

<span id="an_1:19">1:19</span> Going on a little further from there, he
saw James the son of Zebedee, and John, his brother, who were also in
the boat mending the nets.

<span id="an_1:20">1:20</span> Immediately he called them, and they left
their father, Zebedee, in the boat with the hired servants, and went
after him.

<span id="an_1:21">1:21</span> They went into Capernaum, and immediately
on the Sabbath day he entered into the synagogue and taught.

<span id="an_1:22">1:22</span> They were astonished at his teaching, for
he taught them as having authority, and not as the scribes.

<span id="an_1:23">1:23</span> Immediately there was in their synagogue
a man with an unclean spirit, and he cried out,

<span id="an_1:24">1:24</span> saying, "Ha! What do we have to do with
you, Jesus, you Nazarene? Have you come to destroy us? I know you who
you are: the Holy One of God!"

<span id="an_1:25">1:25</span> Jesus rebuked him, saying, "Be quiet, and
come out of him!"

<span id="an_1:26">1:26</span> The unclean spirit, convulsing him and
crying with a loud voice, came out of him.

<span id="an_1:27">1:27</span> They were all amazed, so that they
questioned among themselves, saying, "What is this? A new teaching? For
with authority he commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey him!"

<span id="an_1:28">1:28</span> The report of him went out immediately
everywhere into all the region of Galilee and its surrounding area.

<span id="an_1:29">1:29</span> Immediately, when they had come out of
the synagogue, they came into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James
and John.

<span id="an_1:30">1:30</span> Now Simon's wife's mother lay sick with a
fever, and immediately they told him about her.

<span id="an_1:31">1:31</span> He came and took her by the hand, and
raised her up. The fever left her, and she served them.

<span id="an_1:32">1:32</span> At evening, when the sun had set, they
brought to him all who were sick, and those who were possessed by
demons.

<span id="an_1:33">1:33</span> All the city was gathered together at the
door.

<span id="an_1:34">1:34</span> He healed many who were sick with various
diseases, and cast out many demons. He didn't allow the demons to speak,
because they knew him.

<span id="an_1:35">1:35</span> Early in the morning, while it was still
dark, he rose up and went out, and departed into a deserted place, and
prayed there.

<span id="an_1:36">1:36</span> Simon and those who were with him
followed after him;

<span id="an_1:37">1:37</span> and they found him, and told him,
"Everyone is looking for you."

<span id="an_1:38">1:38</span> He said to them, "Let's go elsewhere into
the next towns, that I may preach there also, because I came out for
this reason."

<span id="an_1:39">1:39</span> He went into their synagogues throughout
all Galilee, preaching and casting out demons.

<span id="an_1:40">1:40</span> A leper came to him, begging him,
kneeling down to him, and saying to him, "If you want to, you can make
me clean."

<span id="an_1:41">1:41</span> Being moved with compassion, he stretched
out his hand, and touched him, and said to him, "I want to. Be made
clean."

<span id="an_1:42">1:42</span> When he had said this, immediately the
leprosy departed from him, and he was made clean.

<span id="an_1:43">1:43</span> He strictly warned him, and immediately
sent him out,

<span id="an_1:44">1:44</span> and said to him, "See you say nothing to
anybody, but go show yourself to the priest, and offer for your
cleansing the things which Moses commanded, for a testimony to them."

<span id="an_1:45">1:45</span> But he went out, and began to proclaim it
much, and to spread about the matter, so that Jesus could no more openly
enter into a city, but was outside in desert places: and they came to
him from everywhere.

<span id="an_2:1">2:1</span> When he entered again into Capernaum after
some days, it was heard that he was in the house.

<span id="an_2:2">2:2</span> Immediately many were gathered together, so
that there was no more room, not even around the door; and he spoke the
word to them.

<span id="an_2:3">2:3</span> Four people came, carrying a paralytic to
him.

<span id="an_2:4">2:4</span> When they could not come near to him for
the crowd, they removed the roof where he was. When they had broken it
up, they let down the mat that the paralytic was lying on.

<span id="an_2:5">2:5</span> Jesus, seeing their faith, said to the
paralytic, "Son, your sins are forgiven you."

<span id="an_2:6">2:6</span> But there were some of the scribes sitting
there, and reasoning in their hearts,

<span id="an_2:7">2:7</span> "Why does this man speak blasphemies like
that? Who can forgive sins but God alone?"

<span id="an_2:8">2:8</span> Immediately Jesus, perceiving in his spirit
that they so reasoned within themselves, said to them, "Why do you
reason these things in your hearts?

<span id="an_2:9">2:9</span> Which is easier, to tell the paralytic,
'Your sins are forgiven;' or to say, 'Arise, and take up your bed, and
walk?'

<span id="an_2:10">2:10</span> But that you may know that the Son of Man
has authority on earth to forgive sins"--he said to the paralytic--

<span id="an_2:11">2:11</span> "I tell you, arise, take up your mat, and
go to your house."

<span id="an_2:12">2:12</span> He arose, and immediately took up the
mat, and went out in front of them all; so that they were all amazed,
and glorified God, saying, "We never saw anything like this!"

<span id="an_2:13">2:13</span> He went out again by the seaside. All the
multitude came to him, and he taught them.

<span id="an_2:14">2:14</span> As he passed by, he saw Levi, the son of
Alphaeus, sitting at the tax office, and he said to him, "Follow me."
And he arose and followed him.

<span id="an_2:15">2:15</span> It happened, that he was reclining at the
table in his house, and many tax collectors and sinners sat down with
Jesus and his disciples, for there were many, and they followed him.

<span id="an_2:16">2:16</span> The scribes and the Pharisees, when they
saw that he was eating with the sinners and tax collectors, said to his
disciples, "Why is it that he eats and drinks with tax collectors and
sinners?"

<span id="an_2:17">2:17</span> When Jesus heard it, he said to them,
"Those who are healthy have no need for a physician, but those who are
sick. I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance."

<span id="an_2:18">2:18</span> John's disciples and the Pharisees were
fasting, and they came and asked him, "Why do John's disciples and the
disciples of the Pharisees fast, but your disciples don't fast?"

<span id="an_2:19">2:19</span> Jesus said to them, "Can the groomsmen
fast while the bridegroom is with them? As long as they have the
bridegroom with them, they can't fast.

<span id="an_2:20">2:20</span> But the days will come when the
bridegroom will be taken away from them, and then will they fast in that
day.

<span id="an_2:21">2:21</span> No one sews a piece of unshrunk cloth on
an old garment, or else the patch shrinks and the new tears away from
the old, and a worse hole is made.

<span id="an_2:22">2:22</span> No one puts new wine into old wineskins,
or else the new wine will burst the skins, and the wine pours out, and
the skins will be destroyed; but they put new wine into fresh
wineskins."

<span id="an_2:23">2:23</span> It happened that he was going on the
Sabbath day through the grain fields, and his disciples began, as they
went, to pluck the ears of grain.

<span id="an_2:24">2:24</span> The Pharisees said to him, "Behold, why
do they do that which is not lawful on the Sabbath day?"

<span id="an_2:25">2:25</span> He said to them, "Did you never read what
David did, when he had need, and was hungry--he, and those who were with
him?

<span id="an_2:26">2:26</span> How he entered into the house of God when
Abiathar was high priest, and ate the show bread, which is not lawful to
eat except for the priests, and gave also to those who were with him?"

<span id="an_2:27">2:27</span> He said to them, "The Sabbath was made
for man, not man for the Sabbath.

<span id="an_2:28">2:28</span> Therefore the Son of Man is lord even of
the Sabbath."

<span id="an_3:1">3:1</span> He entered again into the synagogue, and
there was a man there who had his hand withered.

<span id="an_3:2">3:2</span> They watched him, whether he would heal him
on the Sabbath day, that they might accuse him.

<span id="an_3:3">3:3</span> He said to the man who had his hand
withered, "Stand up."

<span id="an_3:4">3:4</span> He said to them, "Is it lawful on the
Sabbath day to do good, or to do harm? To save a life, or to kill?" But
they were silent.

<span id="an_3:5">3:5</span> When he had looked around at them with
anger, being grieved at the hardening of their hearts, he said to the
man, "Stretch out your hand." He stretched it out, and his hand was
restored as healthy as the other.

<span id="an_3:6">3:6</span> The Pharisees went out, and immediately
conspired with the Herodians against him, how they might destroy him.

<span id="an_3:7">3:7</span> Jesus withdrew to the sea with his
disciples, and a great multitude followed him from Galilee, from Judea,

<span id="an_3:8">3:8</span> from Jerusalem, from Idumaea, beyond the
Jordan, and those from around Tyre and Sidon. A great multitude, hearing
what great things he did, came to him.

<span id="an_3:9">3:9</span> He spoke to his disciples that a little
boat should stay near him because of the crowd, so that they wouldn't
press on him.

<span id="an_3:10">3:10</span> For he had healed many, so that as many
as had diseases pressed on him that they might touch him.

<span id="an_3:11">3:11</span> The unclean spirits, whenever they saw
him, fell down before him, and cried, "You are the Son of God!"

<span id="an_3:12">3:12</span> He sternly warned them that they should
not make him known.

<span id="an_3:13">3:13</span> He went up into the mountain, and called
to himself those whom he wanted, and they went to him.

<span id="an_3:14">3:14</span> He appointed twelve, that they might be
with him, and that he might send them out to preach,

<span id="an_3:15">3:15</span> and to have authority to heal sicknesses
and to cast out demons:

<span id="an_3:16">3:16</span> Simon, to whom he gave the name Peter;

<span id="an_3:17">3:17</span> James the son of Zebedee; John, the
brother of James, and he surnamed them Boanerges, which means, Sons of
Thunder;

<span id="an_3:18">3:18</span> Andrew; Philip; Bartholomew; Matthew;
Thomas; James, the son of Alphaeus; Thaddaeus; Simon the Zealot;

<span id="an_3:19">3:19</span> and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed
him. He came into a house.

<span id="an_3:20">3:20</span> The multitude came together again, so
that they could not so much as eat bread.

<span id="an_3:21">3:21</span> When his friends heard it, they went out
to seize him: for they said, "He is insane."

<span id="an_3:22">3:22</span> The scribes who came down from Jerusalem
said, "He has Beelzebul," and, "By the prince of the demons he casts out
the demons."

<span id="an_3:23">3:23</span> He summoned them, and said to them in
parables, "How can Satan cast out Satan?

<span id="an_3:24">3:24</span> If a kingdom is divided against itself,
that kingdom cannot stand.

<span id="an_3:25">3:25</span> If a house is divided against itself,
that house cannot stand.

<span id="an_3:26">3:26</span> If Satan has risen up against himself,
and is divided, he can't stand, but has an end.

<span id="an_3:27">3:27</span> But no one can enter into the house of
the strong man to plunder, unless he first binds the strong man; and
then he will plunder his house.

<span id="an_3:28">3:28</span> Most certainly I tell you, all sins of
the descendants of man will be forgiven, including their blasphemies
with which they may blaspheme;

<span id="an_3:29">3:29</span> but whoever may blaspheme against the
Holy Spirit never has forgiveness, but is guilty of an eternal sin"

<span id="an_3:30">3:30</span> --because they said, "He has an unclean
spirit."

<span id="an_3:31">3:31</span> His mother and his brothers came, and
standing outside, they sent to him, calling him.

<span id="an_3:32">3:32</span> A multitude was sitting around him, and
they told him, "Behold, your mother, your brothers, and your sisters are
outside looking for you."

<span id="an_3:33">3:33</span> He answered them, "Who are my mother and
my brothers?"

<span id="an_3:34">3:34</span> Looking around at those who sat around
him, he said, "Behold, my mother and my brothers!

<span id="an_3:35">3:35</span> For whoever does the will of God, the
same is my brother, and my sister, and mother."

<span id="an_4:1">4:1</span> Again he began to teach by the seaside. A
great multitude was gathered to him, so that he entered into a boat in
the sea, and sat down. All the multitude were on the land by the sea.

<span id="an_4:2">4:2</span> He taught them many things in parables, and
told them in his teaching,

<span id="an_4:3">4:3</span> "Listen! Behold, the farmer went out to
sow,

<span id="an_4:4">4:4</span> and it happened, as he sowed, some seed
fell by the road, and the birds came and devoured it.

<span id="an_4:5">4:5</span> Others fell on the rocky ground, where it
had little soil, and immediately it sprang up, because it had no depth
of soil.

<span id="an_4:6">4:6</span> When the sun had risen, it was scorched;
and because it had no root, it withered away.

<span id="an_4:7">4:7</span> Others fell among the thorns, and the
thorns grew up, and choked it, and it yielded no fruit.

<span id="an_4:8">4:8</span> Others fell into the good ground, and
yielded fruit, growing up and increasing. Some brought forth thirty
times, some sixty times, and some one hundred times as much."

<span id="an_4:9">4:9</span> He said, "Whoever has ears to hear, let him
hear."

<span id="an_4:10">4:10</span> When he was alone, those who were around
him with the twelve asked him about the parables.

<span id="an_4:11">4:11</span> He said to them, "To you is given the
mystery of the Kingdom of God, but to those who are outside, all things
are done in parables,

<span id="an_4:12">4:12</span> that 'seeing they may see, and not
perceive; and hearing they may hear, and not understand; lest perhaps
they should turn again, and their sins should be forgiven them.'"

<span id="an_4:13">4:13</span> He said to them, "Don't you understand
this parable? How will you understand all of the parables?

<span id="an_4:14">4:14</span> The farmer sows the word.

<span id="an_4:15">4:15</span> The ones by the road are the ones where
the word is sown; and when they have heard, immediately Satan comes, and
takes away the word which has been sown in them.

<span id="an_4:16">4:16</span> These in the same way are those who are
sown on the rocky places, who, when they have heard the word,
immediately receive it with joy.

<span id="an_4:17">4:17</span> They have no root in themselves, but are
short-lived. When oppression or persecution arises because of the word,
immediately they stumble.

<span id="an_4:18">4:18</span> Others are those who are sown among the
thorns. These are those who have heard the word,

<span id="an_4:19">4:19</span> and the cares of this age, and the
deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts of other things entering in choke
the word, and it becomes unfruitful.

<span id="an_4:20">4:20</span> Those which were sown on the good ground
are those who hear the word, and accept it, and bear fruit, some thirty
times, some sixty times, and some one hundred times."

<span id="an_4:21">4:21</span> He said to them, "Is the lamp brought to
be put under a basket or under a bed? Isn't it put on a stand?

<span id="an_4:22">4:22</span> For there is nothing hidden, except that
it should be made known; neither was anything made secret, but that it
should come to light.

<span id="an_4:23">4:23</span> If any man has ears to hear, let him
hear."

<span id="an_4:24">4:24</span> He said to them, "Take heed what you
hear. With whatever measure you measure, it will be measured to you, and
more will be given to you who hear.

<span id="an_4:25">4:25</span> For whoever has, to him will more be
given, and he who doesn't have, even that which he has will be taken
away from him."

<span id="an_4:26">4:26</span> He said, "The Kingdom of God is as if a
man should cast seed on the earth,

<span id="an_4:27">4:27</span> and should sleep and rise night and day,
and the seed should spring up and grow, he doesn't know how.

<span id="an_4:28">4:28</span> For the earth bears fruit: first the
blade, then the ear, then the full grain in the ear.

<span id="an_4:29">4:29</span> But when the fruit is ripe, immediately
he puts forth the sickle, because the harvest has come."

<span id="an_4:30">4:30</span> He said, "How will we liken the Kingdom
of God? Or with what parable will we illustrate it?

<span id="an_4:31">4:31</span> It's like a grain of mustard seed, which,
when it is sown in the earth, though it is less than all the seeds that
are on the earth,

<span id="an_4:32">4:32</span> yet when it is sown, grows up, and
becomes greater than all the herbs, and puts out great branches, so that
the birds of the sky can lodge under its shadow."

<span id="an_4:33">4:33</span> With many such parables he spoke the word
to them, as they were able to hear it.

<span id="an_4:34">4:34</span> Without a parable he didn't speak to
them; but privately to his own disciples he explained everything.

<span id="an_4:35">4:35</span> On that day, when evening had come, he
said to them, "Let's go over to the other side."

<span id="an_4:36">4:36</span> Leaving the multitude, they took him with
them, even as he was, in the boat. Other small boats were also with him.

<span id="an_4:37">4:37</span> A big wind storm arose, and the waves
beat into the boat, so much that the boat was already filled.

<span id="an_4:38">4:38</span> He himself was in the stern, asleep on
the cushion, and they woke him up, and told him, "Teacher, don't you
care that we are dying?"

<span id="an_4:39">4:39</span> He awoke, and rebuked the wind, and said
to the sea, "Peace! Be still!" The wind ceased, and there was a great
calm.

<span id="an_4:40">4:40</span> He said to them, "Why are you so afraid?
How is it that you have no faith?"

<span id="an_4:41">4:41</span> They were greatly afraid, and said to one
another, "Who then is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?"

<span id="an_5:1">5:1</span> They came to the other side of the sea,
into the country of the Gadarenes.

<span id="an_5:2">5:2</span> When he had come out of the boat,
immediately a man with an unclean spirit met him out of the tombs.

<span id="an_5:3">5:3</span> He lived in the tombs. Nobody could bind
him any more, not even with chains,

<span id="an_5:4">5:4</span> because he had been often bound with
fetters and chains, and the chains had been torn apart by him, and the
fetters broken in pieces. Nobody had the strength to tame him.

<span id="an_5:5">5:5</span> Always, night and day, in the tombs and in
the mountains, he was crying out, and cutting himself with stones.

<span id="an_5:6">5:6</span> When he saw Jesus from afar, he ran and
bowed down to him,

<span id="an_5:7">5:7</span> and crying out with a loud voice, he said,
"What have I to do with you, Jesus, you Son of the Most High God? I
adjure you by God, don't torment me."

<span id="an_5:8">5:8</span> For he said to him, "Come out of the man,
you unclean spirit!"

<span id="an_5:9">5:9</span> He asked him, "What is your name?" He said
to him, "My name is Legion, for we are many."

<span id="an_5:10">5:10</span> He begged him much that he would not send
them away out of the country.

<span id="an_5:11">5:11</span> Now on the mountainside there was a great
herd of pigs feeding.

<span id="an_5:12">5:12</span> All the demons begged him, saying, "Send
us into the pigs, that we may enter into them."

<span id="an_5:13">5:13</span> At once Jesus gave them permission. The
unclean spirits came out and entered into the pigs. The herd of about
two thousand rushed down the steep bank into the sea, and they were
drowned in the sea.

<span id="an_5:14">5:14</span> Those who fed them fled, and told it in
the city and in the country. The people came to see what it was that had
happened.

<span id="an_5:15">5:15</span> They came to Jesus, and saw him who had
been possessed by demons sitting, clothed, and in his right mind, even
him who had the legion; and they were afraid.

<span id="an_5:16">5:16</span> Those who saw it declared to them how it
happened to him who was possessed by demons, and about the pigs.

<span id="an_5:17">5:17</span> They began to beg him to depart from
their region.

<span id="an_5:18">5:18</span> As he was entering into the boat, he who
had been possessed by demons begged him that he might be with him.

<span id="an_5:19">5:19</span> He didn't allow him, but said to him, "Go
to your house, to your friends, and tell them what great things the Lord
has done for you, and how he had mercy on you."

<span id="an_5:20">5:20</span> He went his way, and began to proclaim in
Decapolis how Jesus had done great things for him, and everyone
marveled.

<span id="an_5:21">5:21</span> When Jesus had crossed back over in the
boat to the other side, a great multitude was gathered to him; and he
was by the sea.

<span id="an_5:22">5:22</span> Behold, one of the rulers of the
synagogue, Jairus by name, came; and seeing him, he fell at his feet,

<span id="an_5:23">5:23</span> and begged him much, saying, "My little
daughter is at the point of death. Please come and lay your hands on
her, that she may be made healthy, and live."

<span id="an_5:24">5:24</span> He went with him, and a great multitude
followed him, and they pressed upon him on all sides.

<span id="an_5:25">5:25</span> A certain woman, who had an issue of
blood for twelve years,

<span id="an_5:26">5:26</span> and had suffered many things by many
physicians, and had spent all that she had, and was no better, but
rather grew worse,

<span id="an_5:27">5:27</span> having heard the things concerning Jesus,
came up behind him in the crowd, and touched his clothes.

<span id="an_5:28">5:28</span> For she said, "If I just touch his
clothes, I will be made well."

<span id="an_5:29">5:29</span> Immediately the flow of her blood was
dried up, and she felt in her body that she was healed of her
affliction.

<span id="an_5:30">5:30</span> Immediately Jesus, perceiving in himself
that the power had gone out from him, turned around in the crowd, and
asked, "Who touched my clothes?"

<span id="an_5:31">5:31</span> His disciples said to him, "You see the
multitude pressing against you, and you say, 'Who touched me?'"

<span id="an_5:32">5:32</span> He looked around to see her who had done
this thing.

<span id="an_5:33">5:33</span> But the woman, fearing and trembling,
knowing what had been done to her, came and fell down before him, and
told him all the truth.

<span id="an_5:34">5:34</span> He said to her, "Daughter, your faith has
made you well. Go in peace, and be cured of your disease."

<span id="an_5:35">5:35</span> While he was still speaking, people came
from the synagogue ruler's house saying, "Your daughter is dead. Why
bother the Teacher any more?"

<span id="an_5:36">5:36</span> But Jesus, when he heard the message
spoken, immediately said to the ruler of the synagogue, "Don't be
afraid, only believe."

<span id="an_5:37">5:37</span> He allowed no one to follow him, except
Peter, James, and John the brother of James.

<span id="an_5:38">5:38</span> He came to the synagogue ruler's house,
and he saw an uproar, weeping, and great wailing.

<span id="an_5:39">5:39</span> When he had entered in, he said to them,
"Why do you make an uproar and weep? The child is not dead, but is
asleep."

<span id="an_5:40">5:40</span> They ridiculed him. But he, having put
them all out, took the father of the child, her mother, and those who
were with him, and went in where the child was lying.

<span id="an_5:41">5:41</span> Taking the child by the hand, he said to
her, "Talitha cumi!" which means, being interpreted, "Girl, I tell you,
get up!"

<span id="an_5:42">5:42</span> Immediately the girl rose up and walked,
for she was twelve years old. They were amazed with great amazement.

<span id="an_5:43">5:43</span> He strictly ordered them that no one
should know this, and commanded that something should be given to her to
eat.

<span id="an_6:1">6:1</span> He went out from there. He came into his
own country, and his disciples followed him.

<span id="an_6:2">6:2</span> When the Sabbath had come, he began to
teach in the synagogue, and many hearing him were astonished, saying,
"Where did this man get these things?" and, "What is the wisdom that is
given to this man, that such mighty works come about by his hands?

<span id="an_6:3">6:3</span> Isn't this the carpenter, the son of Mary,
and brother of James, Joses, Judah, and Simon? Aren't his sisters here
with us?" They were offended at him.

<span id="an_6:4">6:4</span> Jesus said to them, "A prophet is not
without honor, except in his own country, and among his own relatives,
and in his own house."

<span id="an_6:5">6:5</span> He could do no mighty work there, except
that he laid his hands on a few sick people, and healed them.

<span id="an_6:6">6:6</span> He marveled because of their unbelief. He
went around the villages teaching.

<span id="an_6:7">6:7</span> He called to himself the twelve, and began
to send them out two by two; and he gave them authority over the unclean
spirits.

<span id="an_6:8">6:8</span> He commanded them that they should take
nothing for their journey, except a staff only: no bread, no wallet, no
money in their purse,

<span id="an_6:9">6:9</span> but to wear sandals, and not put on two
tunics.

<span id="an_6:10">6:10</span> He said to them, "Wherever you enter into
a house, stay there until you depart from there.

<span id="an_6:11">6:11</span> Whoever will not receive you nor hear
you, as you depart from there, shake off the dust that is under your
feet for a testimony against them. Assuredly, I tell you, it will be
more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment than for
that city!"

<span id="an_6:12">6:12</span> They went out and preached that people
should repent.

<span id="an_6:13">6:13</span> They cast out many demons, and anointed
many with oil who were sick, and healed them.

<span id="an_6:14">6:14</span> King Herod heard this, for his name had
become known, and he said, "John the Baptizer has risen from the dead,
and therefore these powers are at work in him."

<span id="an_6:15">6:15</span> But others said, "He is Elijah." Others
said, "He is a prophet, or like one of the prophets."

<span id="an_6:16">6:16</span> But Herod, when he heard this, said,
"This is John, whom I beheaded. He has risen from the dead."

<span id="an_6:17">6:17</span> For Herod himself had sent out and
arrested John, and bound him in prison for the sake of Herodias, his
brother Philip's wife, for he had married her.

<span id="an_6:18">6:18</span> For John said to Herod, "It is not lawful
for you to have your brother's wife."

<span id="an_6:19">6:19</span> Herodias set herself against him, and
desired to kill him, but she couldn't,

<span id="an_6:20">6:20</span> for Herod feared John, knowing that he
was a righteous and holy man, and kept him safe. When he heard him, he
did many things, and he heard him gladly.

<span id="an_6:21">6:21</span> Then a convenient day came, that Herod on
his birthday made a supper for his nobles, the high officers, and the
chief men of Galilee.

<span id="an_6:22">6:22</span> When the daughter of Herodias herself
came in and danced, she pleased Herod and those sitting with him. The
king said to the young lady, "Ask me whatever you want, and I will give
it to you."

<span id="an_6:23">6:23</span> He swore to her, "Whatever you shall ask
of me, I will give you, up to half of my kingdom."

<span id="an_6:24">6:24</span> She went out, and said to her mother,
"What shall I ask?" She said, "The head of John the Baptizer."

<span id="an_6:25">6:25</span> She came in immediately with haste to the
king, and asked, "I want you to give me right now the head of John the
Baptizer on a platter."

<span id="an_6:26">6:26</span> The king was exceedingly sorry, but for
the sake of his oaths, and of his dinner guests, he didn't wish to
refuse her.

<span id="an_6:27">6:27</span> Immediately the king sent out a soldier
of his guard, and commanded to bring John's head, and he went and
beheaded him in the prison,

<span id="an_6:28">6:28</span> and brought his head on a platter, and
gave it to the young lady; and the young lady gave it to her mother.

<span id="an_6:29">6:29</span> When his disciples heard this, they came
and took up his corpse, and laid it in a tomb.

<span id="an_6:30">6:30</span> The apostles gathered themselves together
to Jesus, and they told him all things, whatever they had done, and
whatever they had taught.

<span id="an_6:31">6:31</span> He said to them, "You come apart into a
deserted place, and rest awhile." For there were many coming and going,
and they had no leisure so much as to eat.

<span id="an_6:32">6:32</span> They went away in the boat to a deserted
place by themselves.

<span id="an_6:33">6:33</span> They saw them going, and many recognized
him and ran there on foot from all the cities. They arrived before them
and came together to him.

<span id="an_6:34">6:34</span> Jesus came out, saw a great multitude,
and he had compassion on them, because they were like sheep without a
shepherd, and he began to teach them many things.

<span id="an_6:35">6:35</span> When it was late in the day, his
disciples came to him, and said, "This place is deserted, and it is late
in the day.

<span id="an_6:36">6:36</span> Send them away, that they may go into the
surrounding country and villages, and buy themselves bread, for they
have nothing to eat."

<span id="an_6:37">6:37</span> But he answered them, "You give them
something to eat." They asked him, "Shall we go and buy two hundred
denarii worth of bread, and give them something to eat?"

<span id="an_6:38">6:38</span> He said to them, "How many loaves do you
have? Go see." When they knew, they said, "Five, and two fish."

<span id="an_6:39">6:39</span> He commanded them that everyone should
sit down in groups on the green grass.

<span id="an_6:40">6:40</span> They sat down in ranks, by hundreds and
by fifties.

<span id="an_6:41">6:41</span> He took the five loaves and the two fish,
and looking up to heaven, he blessed and broke the loaves, and he gave
to his disciples to set before them, and he divided the two fish among
them all.

<span id="an_6:42">6:42</span> They all ate, and were filled.

<span id="an_6:43">6:43</span> They took up twelve baskets full of
broken pieces and also of the fish.

<span id="an_6:44">6:44</span> Those who ate the loaves were five
thousand men.

<span id="an_6:45">6:45</span> Immediately he made his disciples get
into the boat, and to go ahead to the other side, to Bethsaida, while he
himself sent the multitude away.

<span id="an_6:46">6:46</span> After he had taken leave of them, he went
up the mountain to pray.

<span id="an_6:47">6:47</span> When evening had come, the boat was in
the midst of the sea, and he was alone on the land.

<span id="an_6:48">6:48</span> Seeing them distressed in rowing, for the
wind was contrary to them, about the fourth watch of the night he came
to them, walking on the sea, and he would have passed by them,

<span id="an_6:49">6:49</span> but they, when they saw him walking on
the sea, supposed that it was a ghost, and cried out;

<span id="an_6:50">6:50</span> for they all saw him, and were troubled.
But he immediately spoke with them, and said to them, "Cheer up! It is
I! Don't be afraid."

<span id="an_6:51">6:51</span> He got into the boat with them; and the
wind ceased, and they were very amazed among themselves, and marveled;

<span id="an_6:52">6:52</span> for they hadn't understood about the
loaves, but their hearts were hardened.

<span id="an_6:53">6:53</span> When they had crossed over, they came to
land at Gennesaret, and moored to the shore.

<span id="an_6:54">6:54</span> When they had come out of the boat,
immediately the people recognized him,

<span id="an_6:55">6:55</span> and ran around that whole region, and
began to bring those who were sick, on their mats, to where they heard
he was.

<span id="an_6:56">6:56</span> Wherever he entered, into villages, or
into cities, or into the country, they laid the sick in the
marketplaces, and begged him that they might touch just the fringe of
his garment; and as many as touched him were made well.

<span id="an_7:1">7:1</span> Then the Pharisees, and some of the scribes
gathered together to him, having come from Jerusalem.

<span id="an_7:2">7:2</span> Now when they saw some of his disciples
eating bread with defiled, that is, unwashed, hands, they found fault.

<span id="an_7:3">7:3</span> (For the Pharisees, and all the Jews, don't
eat unless they wash their hands and forearms, holding to the tradition
of the elders.

<span id="an_7:4">7:4</span> They don't eat when they come from the
marketplace, unless they bathe themselves, and there are many other
things, which they have received to hold to: washings of cups, pitchers,
bronze vessels, and couches.)

<span id="an_7:5">7:5</span> The Pharisees and the scribes asked him,
"Why don't your disciples walk according to the tradition of the elders,
but eat their bread with unwashed hands?"

<span id="an_7:6">7:6</span> He answered them, "Well did Isaiah prophesy
of you hypocrites, as it is written, 'This people honors me with their
lips, but their heart is far from me.

<span id="an_7:7">7:7</span> But in vain do they worship me, teaching as
doctrines the commandments of men.'

<span id="an_7:8">7:8</span> "For you set aside the commandment of God,
and hold tightly to the tradition of men--the washing of pitchers and
cups, and you do many other such things."

<span id="an_7:9">7:9</span> He said to them, "Full well do you reject
the commandment of God, that you may keep your tradition.

<span id="an_7:10">7:10</span> For Moses said, 'Honor your father and
your mother;' and, 'He who speaks evil of father or mother, let him be
put to death.'

<span id="an_7:11">7:11</span> But you say, 'If a man tells his father
or his mother, "Whatever profit you might have received from me is
Corban, that is to say, given to God;"'

<span id="an_7:12">7:12</span> then you no longer allow him to do
anything for his father or his mother,

<span id="an_7:13">7:13</span> making void the word of God by your
tradition, which you have handed down. You do many things like this."

<span id="an_7:14">7:14</span> He called all the multitude to himself,
and said to them, "Hear me, all of you, and understand.

<span id="an_7:15">7:15</span> There is nothing from outside of the man,
that going into him can defile him; but the things which proceed out of
the man are those that defile the man.

<span id="an_7:16">7:16</span> If anyone has ears to hear, let him
hear!"

<span id="an_7:17">7:17</span> When he had entered into a house away
from the multitude, his disciples asked him about the parable.

<span id="an_7:18">7:18</span> He said to them, "Are you thus without
understanding also? Don't you perceive that whatever goes into the man
from outside can't defile him,

<span id="an_7:19">7:19</span> because it doesn't go into his heart, but
into his stomach, then into the latrine, thus purifying all foods?"

<span id="an_7:20">7:20</span> He said, "That which proceeds out of the
man, that defiles the man.

<span id="an_7:21">7:21</span> For from within, out of the hearts of
men, proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, sexual sins, murders, thefts,

<span id="an_7:22">7:22</span> covetings, wickedness, deceit, lustful
desires, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, and foolishness.

<span id="an_7:23">7:23</span> All these evil things come from within,
and defile the man."

<span id="an_7:24">7:24</span> From there he arose, and went away into
the borders of Tyre and Sidon. He entered into a house, and didn't want
anyone to know it, but he couldn't escape notice.

<span id="an_7:25">7:25</span> For a woman, whose little daughter had an
unclean spirit, having heard of him, came and fell down at his feet.

<span id="an_7:26">7:26</span> Now the woman was a Greek, a
Syrophoenician by race. She begged him that he would cast the demon out
of her daughter.

<span id="an_7:27">7:27</span> But Jesus said to her, "Let the children
be filled first, for it is not appropriate to take the children's bread
and throw it to the dogs."

<span id="an_7:28">7:28</span> But she answered him, "Yes, Lord. Yet
even the dogs under the table eat the children's crumbs."

<span id="an_7:29">7:29</span> He said to her, "For this saying, go your
way. The demon has gone out of your daughter."

<span id="an_7:30">7:30</span> She went away to her house, and found the
child having been laid on the bed, with the demon gone out.

<span id="an_7:31">7:31</span> Again he departed from the borders of
Tyre and Sidon, and came to the sea of Galilee, through the midst of the
region of Decapolis.

<span id="an_7:32">7:32</span> They brought to him one who was deaf and
had an impediment in his speech. They begged him to lay his hand on him.

<span id="an_7:33">7:33</span> He took him aside from the multitude,
privately, and put his fingers into his ears, and he spat, and touched
his tongue.

<span id="an_7:34">7:34</span> Looking up to heaven, he sighed, and said
to him, "Ephphatha!" that is, "Be opened!"

<span id="an_7:35">7:35</span> Immediately his ears were opened, and the
impediment of his tongue was released, and he spoke clearly.

<span id="an_7:36">7:36</span> He commanded them that they should tell
no one, but the more he commanded them, so much the more widely they
proclaimed it.

<span id="an_7:37">7:37</span> They were astonished beyond measure,
saying, "He has done all things well. He makes even the deaf hear, and
the mute speak!"

<span id="an_8:1">8:1</span> In those days, when there was a very great
multitude, and they had nothing to eat, Jesus called his disciples to
himself, and said to them,

<span id="an_8:2">8:2</span> "I have compassion on the multitude,
because they have stayed with me now three days, and have nothing to
eat.

<span id="an_8:3">8:3</span> If I send them away fasting to their home,
they will faint on the way, for some of them have come a long way."

<span id="an_8:4">8:4</span> His disciples answered him, "From where
could one satisfy these people with bread here in a deserted place?"

<span id="an_8:5">8:5</span> He asked them, "How many loaves do you
have?" They said, "Seven."

<span id="an_8:6">8:6</span> He commanded the multitude to sit down on
the ground, and he took the seven loaves. Having given thanks, he broke
them, and gave them to his disciples to serve, and they served the
multitude.

<span id="an_8:7">8:7</span> They had a few small fish. Having blessed
them, he said to serve these also.

<span id="an_8:8">8:8</span> They ate, and were filled. They took up
seven baskets of broken pieces that were left over.

<span id="an_8:9">8:9</span> Those who had eaten were about four
thousand. Then he sent them away.

<span id="an_8:10">8:10</span> Immediately he entered into the boat with
his disciples, and came into the region of Dalmanutha.

<span id="an_8:11">8:11</span> The Pharisees came out and began to
question him, seeking from him a sign from heaven, and testing him.

<span id="an_8:12">8:12</span> He sighed deeply in his spirit, and said,
"Why does this generation seek a sign? Most certainly I tell you, no
sign will be given to this generation."

<span id="an_8:13">8:13</span> He left them, and again entering into the
boat, departed to the other side.

<span id="an_8:14">8:14</span> They forgot to take bread; and they
didn't have more than one loaf in the boat with them.

<span id="an_8:15">8:15</span> He warned them, saying, "Take heed:
beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and the yeast of Herod."

<span id="an_8:16">8:16</span> They reasoned with one another, saying,
"It's because we have no bread."

<span id="an_8:17">8:17</span> Jesus, perceiving it, said to them, "Why
do you reason that it's because you have no bread? Don't you perceive
yet, neither understand? Is your heart still hardened?

<span id="an_8:18">8:18</span> Having eyes, don't you see? Having ears,
don't you hear? Don't you remember?

<span id="an_8:19">8:19</span> When I broke the five loaves among the
five thousand, how many baskets full of broken pieces did you take up?"
They told him, "Twelve."

<span id="an_8:20">8:20</span> "When the seven loaves fed the four
thousand, how many baskets full of broken pieces did you take up?" They
told him, "Seven."

<span id="an_8:21">8:21</span> He asked them, "Don't you understand,
yet?"

<span id="an_8:22">8:22</span> He came to Bethsaida. They brought a
blind man to him, and begged him to touch him.

<span id="an_8:23">8:23</span> He took hold of the blind man by the
hand, and brought him out of the village. When he had spit on his eyes,
and laid his hands on him, he asked him if he saw anything.

<span id="an_8:24">8:24</span> He looked up, and said, "I see men; for I
see them like trees walking."

<span id="an_8:25">8:25</span> Then again he laid his hands on his eyes.
He looked intently, and was restored, and saw everyone clearly.

<span id="an_8:26">8:26</span> He sent him away to his house, saying,
"Don't enter into the village, nor tell anyone in the village."

<span id="an_8:27">8:27</span> Jesus went out, with his disciples, into
the villages of Caesarea Philippi. On the way he asked his disciples,
"Who do men say that I am?"

<span id="an_8:28">8:28</span> They told him, "John the Baptizer, and
others say Elijah, but others: one of the prophets."

<span id="an_8:29">8:29</span> He said to them, "But who do you say that
I am?" Peter answered, "You are the Christ."

<span id="an_8:30">8:30</span> He commanded them that they should tell
no one about him.

<span id="an_8:31">8:31</span> He began to teach them that the Son of
Man must suffer many things, and be rejected by the elders, the chief
priests, and the scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise
again.

<span id="an_8:32">8:32</span> He spoke to them openly. Peter took him,
and began to rebuke him.

<span id="an_8:33">8:33</span> But he, turning around, and seeing his
disciples, rebuked Peter, and said, "Get behind me, Satan! For you have
in mind not the things of God, but the things of men."

<span id="an_8:34">8:34</span> He called the multitude to himself with
his disciples, and said to them, "Whoever wants to come after me, let
him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.

<span id="an_8:35">8:35</span> For whoever wants to save his life will
lose it; and whoever will lose his life for my sake and the sake of the
Good News will save it.

<span id="an_8:36">8:36</span> For what does it profit a man, to gain
the whole world, and forfeit his life?

<span id="an_8:37">8:37</span> For what will a man give in exchange for
his life?

<span id="an_8:38">8:38</span> For whoever will be ashamed of me and of
my words in this adulterous and sinful generation, the Son of Man also
will be ashamed of him, when he comes in the glory of his Father with
the holy angels."

<span id="an_9:1">9:1</span> He said to them, "Most certainly I tell
you, there are some standing here who will in no way taste death until
they see the Kingdom of God come with power."

<span id="an_9:2">9:2</span> After six days Jesus took with him Peter,
James, and John, and brought them up onto a high mountain privately by
themselves, and he was changed into another form in front of them.

<span id="an_9:3">9:3</span> His clothing became glistening, exceedingly
white, like snow, such as no launderer on earth can whiten them.

<span id="an_9:4">9:4</span> Elijah and Moses appeared to them, and they
were talking with Jesus.

<span id="an_9:5">9:5</span> Peter answered Jesus, "Rabbi, it is good
for us to be here. Let's make three tents: one for you, one for Moses,
and one for Elijah."

<span id="an_9:6">9:6</span> For he didn't know what to say, for they
were very afraid.

<span id="an_9:7">9:7</span> A cloud came, overshadowing them, and a
voice came out of the cloud, "This is my beloved Son. Listen to him."

<span id="an_9:8">9:8</span> Suddenly looking around, they saw no one
with them any more, except Jesus only.

<span id="an_9:9">9:9</span> As they were coming down from the mountain,
he commanded them that they should tell no one what things they had
seen, until after the Son of Man had risen from the dead.

<span id="an_9:10">9:10</span> They kept this saying to themselves,
questioning what the "rising from the dead" meant.

<span id="an_9:11">9:11</span> They asked him, saying, "Why do the
scribes say that Elijah must come first?"

<span id="an_9:12">9:12</span> He said to them, "Elijah indeed comes
first, and restores all things. How is it written about the Son of Man,
that he should suffer many things and be despised?

<span id="an_9:13">9:13</span> But I tell you that Elijah has come, and
they have also done to him whatever they wanted to, even as it is
written about him."

<span id="an_9:14">9:14</span> Coming to the disciples, he saw a great
multitude around them, and scribes questioning them.

<span id="an_9:15">9:15</span> Immediately all the multitude, when they
saw him, were greatly amazed, and running to him greeted him.

<span id="an_9:16">9:16</span> He asked the scribes, "What are you
asking them?"

<span id="an_9:17">9:17</span> One of the multitude answered, "Teacher,
I brought to you my son, who has a mute spirit;

<span id="an_9:18">9:18</span> and wherever it seizes him, it throws him
down, and he foams at the mouth, and grinds his teeth, and wastes away.
I asked your disciples to cast it out, and they weren't able."

<span id="an_9:19">9:19</span> He answered him, "Unbelieving generation,
how long shall I be with you? How long shall I bear with you? Bring him
to me."

<span id="an_9:20">9:20</span> They brought him to him, and when he saw
him, immediately the spirit convulsed him, and he fell on the ground,
wallowing and foaming at the mouth.

<span id="an_9:21">9:21</span> He asked his father, "How long has it
been since this has come to him?" He said, "From childhood.

<span id="an_9:22">9:22</span> Often it has cast him both into the fire
and into the water, to destroy him. But if you can do anything, have
compassion on us, and help us."

<span id="an_9:23">9:23</span> Jesus said to him, "If you can believe,
all things are possible to him who believes."

<span id="an_9:24">9:24</span> Immediately the father of the child cried
out with tears, "I believe. Help my unbelief!"

<span id="an_9:25">9:25</span> When Jesus saw that a multitude came
running together, he rebuked the unclean spirit, saying to him, "You
mute and deaf spirit, I command you, come out of him, and never enter
him again!"

<span id="an_9:26">9:26</span> Having cried out, and convulsed greatly,
it came out of him. The boy became like one dead; so much that most of
them said, "He is dead."

<span id="an_9:27">9:27</span> But Jesus took him by the hand, and
raised him up; and he arose.

<span id="an_9:28">9:28</span> When he had come into the house, his
disciples asked him privately, "Why couldn't we cast it out?"

<span id="an_9:29">9:29</span> He said to them, "This kind can come out
by nothing, except by prayer and fasting."

<span id="an_9:30">9:30</span> They went out from there, and passed
through Galilee. He didn't want anyone to know it.

<span id="an_9:31">9:31</span> For he was teaching his disciples, and
said to them, "The Son of Man is being handed over to the hands of men,
and they will kill him; and when he is killed, on the third day he will
rise again."

<span id="an_9:32">9:32</span> But they didn't understand the saying,
and were afraid to ask him.

<span id="an_9:33">9:33</span> He came to Capernaum, and when he was in
the house he asked them, "What were you arguing among yourselves on the
way?"

<span id="an_9:34">9:34</span> But they were silent, for they had
disputed one with another on the way about who was the greatest.

<span id="an_9:35">9:35</span> He sat down, and called the twelve; and
he said to them, "If any man wants to be first, he shall be last of all,
and servant of all."

<span id="an_9:36">9:36</span> He took a little child, and set him in
the midst of them. Taking him in his arms, he said to them,

<span id="an_9:37">9:37</span> "Whoever receives one such little child
in my name, receives me, and whoever receives me, doesn't receive me,
but him who sent me."

<span id="an_9:38">9:38</span> John said to him, "Teacher, we saw
someone who doesn't follow us casting out demons in your name; and we
forbade him, because he doesn't follow us."

<span id="an_9:39">9:39</span> But Jesus said, "Don't forbid him, for
there is no one who will do a mighty work in my name, and be able
quickly to speak evil of me.

<span id="an_9:40">9:40</span> For whoever is not against us is on our
side.

<span id="an_9:41">9:41</span> For whoever will give you a cup of water
to drink in my name, because you are Christ's, most certainly I tell
you, he will in no way lose his reward.

<span id="an_9:42">9:42</span> Whoever will cause one of these little
ones who believe in me to stumble, it would be better for him if he was
thrown into the sea with a millstone hung around his neck.

<span id="an_9:43">9:43</span> If your hand causes you to stumble, cut
it off. It is better for you to enter into life maimed, rather than
having your two hands to go into Gehenna, into the unquenchable fire,

<span id="an_9:44">9:44</span> 'where their worm doesn't die, and the
fire is not quenched.'

<span id="an_9:45">9:45</span> If your foot causes you to stumble, cut
it off. It is better for you to enter into life lame, rather than having
your two feet to be cast into Gehenna, into the fire that will never be
quenched--

<span id="an_9:46">9:46</span> 'where their worm doesn't die, and the
fire is not quenched.'

<span id="an_9:47">9:47</span> If your eye causes you to stumble, cast
it out. It is better for you to enter into the Kingdom of God with one
eye, rather than having two eyes to be cast into the Gehenna of fire,

<span id="an_9:48">9:48</span> 'where their worm doesn't die, and the
fire is not quenched.'

<span id="an_9:49">9:49</span> For everyone will be salted with fire,
and every sacrifice will be seasoned with salt.

<span id="an_9:50">9:50</span> Salt is good, but if the salt has lost
its saltiness, with what will you season it? Have salt in yourselves,
and be at peace with one another."

<span id="an_10:1">10:1</span> He arose from there and came into the
borders of Judea and beyond the Jordan. Multitudes came together to him
again. As he usually did, he was again teaching them.

<span id="an_10:2">10:2</span> Pharisees came to him testing him, and
asked him, "Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife?"

<span id="an_10:3">10:3</span> He answered, "What did Moses command
you?"

<span id="an_10:4">10:4</span> They said, "Moses allowed a certificate
of divorce to be written, and to divorce her."

<span id="an_10:5">10:5</span> But Jesus said to them, "For your
hardness of heart, he wrote you this commandment.

<span id="an_10:6">10:6</span> But from the beginning of the creation,
God made them male and female.

<span id="an_10:7">10:7</span> For this cause a man will leave his
father and mother, and will join to his wife,

<span id="an_10:8">10:8</span> and the two will become one flesh, so
that they are no longer two, but one flesh.

<span id="an_10:9">10:9</span> What therefore God has joined together,
let no man separate."

<span id="an_10:10">10:10</span> In the house, his disciples asked him
again about the same matter.

<span id="an_10:11">10:11</span> He said to them, "Whoever divorces his
wife, and marries another, commits adultery against her.

<span id="an_10:12">10:12</span> If a woman herself divorces her
husband, and marries another, she commits adultery."

<span id="an_10:13">10:13</span> They were bringing to him little
children, that he should touch them, but the disciples rebuked those who
were bringing them.

<span id="an_10:14">10:14</span> But when Jesus saw it, he was moved
with indignation, and said to them, "Allow the little children to come
to me! Don't forbid them, for the Kingdom of God belongs to such as
these.

<span id="an_10:15">10:15</span> Most certainly I tell you, whoever will
not receive the Kingdom of God like a little child, he will in no way
enter into it."

<span id="an_10:16">10:16</span> He took them in his arms, and blessed
them, laying his hands on them.

<span id="an_10:17">10:17</span> As he was going out into the way, one
ran to him, knelt before him, and asked him, "Good Teacher, what shall I
do that I may inherit eternal life?"

<span id="an_10:18">10:18</span> Jesus said to him, "Why do you call me
good? No one is good except one--God.

<span id="an_10:19">10:19</span> You know the commandments: 'Do not
murder,' 'Do not commit adultery,' 'Do not steal,' 'Do not give false
testimony,' 'Do not defraud,' 'Honor your father and mother.'"

<span id="an_10:20">10:20</span> He said to him, "Teacher, I have
observed all these things from my youth."

<span id="an_10:21">10:21</span> Jesus looking at him loved him, and
said to him, "One thing you lack. Go, sell whatever you have, and give
to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me,
taking up the cross."

<span id="an_10:22">10:22</span> But his face fell at that saying, and
he went away sorrowful, for he was one who had great possessions.

<span id="an_10:23">10:23</span> Jesus looked around, and said to his
disciples, "How difficult it is for those who have riches to enter into
the Kingdom of God!"

<span id="an_10:24">10:24</span> The disciples were amazed at his words.
But Jesus answered again, "Children, how hard is it for those who trust
in riches to enter into the Kingdom of God!

<span id="an_10:25">10:25</span> It is easier for a camel to go through
a needle's eye than for a rich man to enter into the Kingdom of God."

<span id="an_10:26">10:26</span> They were exceedingly astonished,
saying to him, "Then who can be saved?"

<span id="an_10:27">10:27</span> Jesus, looking at them, said, "With men
it is impossible, but not with God, for all things are possible with
God."

<span id="an_10:28">10:28</span> Peter began to tell him, "Behold, we
have left all, and have followed you."

<span id="an_10:29">10:29</span> Jesus said, "Most certainly I tell you,
there is no one who has left house, or brothers, or sisters, or father,
or mother, or wife, or children, or land, for my sake, and for the sake
of the Good News,

<span id="an_10:30">10:30</span> but he will receive one hundred times
more now in this time, houses, brothers, sisters, mothers, children, and
land, with persecutions; and in the age to come eternal life.

<span id="an_10:31">10:31</span> But many who are first will be last;
and the last first."

<span id="an_10:32">10:32</span> They were on the way, going up to
Jerusalem; and Jesus was going in front of them, and they were amazed;
and those who followed were afraid. He again took the twelve, and began
to tell them the things that were going to happen to him.

<span id="an_10:33">10:33</span> "Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem.
The Son of Man will be delivered to the chief priests and the scribes.
They will condemn him to death, and will deliver him to the Gentiles.

<span id="an_10:34">10:34</span> They will mock him, spit on him,
scourge him, and kill him. On the third day he will rise again."

<span id="an_10:35">10:35</span> James and John, the sons of Zebedee,
came near to him, saying, "Teacher, we want you to do for us whatever we
will ask."

<span id="an_10:36">10:36</span> He said to them, "What do you want me
to do for you?"

<span id="an_10:37">10:37</span> They said to him, "Grant to us that we
may sit, one at your right hand, and one at your left hand, in your
glory."

<span id="an_10:38">10:38</span> But Jesus said to them, "You don't know
what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup that I drink, and to
be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?"

<span id="an_10:39">10:39</span> They said to him, "We are able." Jesus
said to them, "You shall indeed drink the cup that I drink, and you
shall be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with;

<span id="an_10:40">10:40</span> but to sit at my right hand and at my
left hand is not mine to give, but for whom it has been prepared."

<span id="an_10:41">10:41</span> When the ten heard it, they began to be
indignant towards James and John.

<span id="an_10:42">10:42</span> Jesus summoned them, and said to them,
"You know that they who are recognized as rulers over the nations lord
it over them, and their great ones exercise authority over them.

<span id="an_10:43">10:43</span> But it shall not be so among you, but
whoever wants to become great among you shall be your servant.

<span id="an_10:44">10:44</span> Whoever of you wants to become first
among you, shall be bondservant of all.

<span id="an_10:45">10:45</span> For the Son of Man also came not to be
served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many."

<span id="an_10:46">10:46</span> They came to Jericho. As he went out
from Jericho, with his disciples and a great multitude, the son of
Timaeus, Bartimaeus, a blind beggar, was sitting by the road.

<span id="an_10:47">10:47</span> When he heard that it was Jesus the
Nazarene, he began to cry out, and say, "Jesus, you son of David, have
mercy on me!"

<span id="an_10:48">10:48</span> Many rebuked him, that he should be
quiet, but he cried out much more, "You son of David, have mercy on me!"

<span id="an_10:49">10:49</span> Jesus stood still, and said, "Call
him." They called the blind man, saying to him, "Cheer up! Get up. He is
calling you!"

<span id="an_10:50">10:50</span> He, casting away his cloak, sprang up,
and came to Jesus.

<span id="an_10:51">10:51</span> Jesus asked him, "What do you want me
to do for you?" The blind man said to him, "Rabboni, that I may see
again."

<span id="an_10:52">10:52</span> Jesus said to him, "Go your way. Your
faith has made you well." Immediately he received his sight, and
followed Jesus in the way.

<span id="an_11:1">11:1</span> When they drew near to Jerusalem, to
Bethsphage and Bethany, at the Mount of Olives, he sent two of his
disciples,

<span id="an_11:2">11:2</span> and said to them, "Go your way into the
village that is opposite you. Immediately as you enter into it, you will
find a young donkey tied, on which no one has sat. Untie him, and bring
him.

<span id="an_11:3">11:3</span> If anyone asks you, 'Why are you doing
this?' say, 'The Lord needs him;' and immediately he will send him back
here."

<span id="an_11:4">11:4</span> They went away, and found a young donkey
tied at the door outside in the open street, and they untied him.

<span id="an_11:5">11:5</span> Some of those who stood there asked them,
"What are you doing, untying the young donkey?"

<span id="an_11:6">11:6</span> They said to them just as Jesus had said,
and they let them go.

<span id="an_11:7">11:7</span> They brought the young donkey to Jesus,
and threw their garments on it, and Jesus sat on it.

<span id="an_11:8">11:8</span> Many spread their garments on the way,
and others were cutting down branches from the trees, and spreading them
on the road.

<span id="an_11:9">11:9</span> Those who went in front, and those who
followed, cried out, "Hosanna! Blessed is he who comes in the name of
the Lord!

<span id="an_11:10">11:10</span> Blessed is the kingdom of our father
David that is coming in the name of the Lord! Hosanna in the highest!"

<span id="an_11:11">11:11</span> Jesus entered into the temple in
Jerusalem. When he had looked around at everything, it being now
evening, he went out to Bethany with the twelve.

<span id="an_11:12">11:12</span> The next day, when they had come out
from Bethany, he was hungry.

<span id="an_11:13">11:13</span> Seeing a fig tree afar off having
leaves, he came to see if perhaps he might find anything on it. When he
came to it, he found nothing but leaves, for it was not the season for
figs.

<span id="an_11:14">11:14</span> Jesus told it, "May no one ever eat
fruit from you again!" and his disciples heard it.

<span id="an_11:15">11:15</span> They came to Jerusalem, and Jesus
entered into the temple, and began to throw out those who sold and those
who bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the money
changers, and the seats of those who sold the doves.

<span id="an_11:16">11:16</span> He would not allow anyone to carry a
container through the temple.

<span id="an_11:17">11:17</span> He taught, saying to them, "Isn't it
written, 'My house will be called a house of prayer for all the
nations?' But you have made it a den of robbers!"

<span id="an_11:18">11:18</span> The chief priests and the scribes heard
it, and sought how they might destroy him. For they feared him, because
all the multitude was astonished at his teaching.

<span id="an_11:19">11:19</span> When evening came, he went out of the
city.

<span id="an_11:20">11:20</span> As they passed by in the morning, they
saw the fig tree withered away from the roots.

<span id="an_11:21">11:21</span> Peter, remembering, said to him,
"Rabbi, look! The fig tree which you cursed has withered away."

<span id="an_11:22">11:22</span> Jesus answered them, "Have faith in
God.

<span id="an_11:23">11:23</span> For most certainly I tell you, whoever
may tell this mountain, 'Be taken up and cast into the sea,' and doesn't
doubt in his heart, but believes that what he says is happening; he
shall have whatever he says.

<span id="an_11:24">11:24</span> Therefore I tell you, all things
whatever you pray and ask for, believe that you have received them, and
you shall have them.

<span id="an_11:25">11:25</span> Whenever you stand praying, forgive, if
you have anything against anyone; so that your Father, who is in heaven,
may also forgive you your transgressions.

<span id="an_11:26">11:26</span> But if you do not forgive, neither will
your Father in heaven forgive your transgressions."

<span id="an_11:27">11:27</span> They came again to Jerusalem, and as he
was walking in the temple, the chief priests, and the scribes, and the
elders came to him,

<span id="an_11:28">11:28</span> and they began saying to him, "By what
authority do you do these things? Or who gave you this authority to do
these things?"

<span id="an_11:29">11:29</span> Jesus said to them, "I will ask you one
question. Answer me, and I will tell you by what authority I do these
things.

<span id="an_11:30">11:30</span> The baptism of John--was it from
heaven, or from men? Answer me."

<span id="an_11:31">11:31</span> They reasoned with themselves, saying,
"If we should say, 'From heaven;' he will say, 'Why then did you not
believe him?'

<span id="an_11:32">11:32</span> If we should say, 'From men'"--they
feared the people, for all held John to really be a prophet.

<span id="an_11:33">11:33</span> They answered Jesus, "We don't know."
Jesus said to them, "Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these
things."

<span id="an_12:1">12:1</span> He began to speak to them in parables. "A
man planted a vineyard, put a hedge around it, dug a pit for the
winepress, built a tower, rented it out to a farmer, and went into
another country.

<span id="an_12:2">12:2</span> When it was time, he sent a servant to
the farmer to get from the farmer his share of the fruit of the
vineyard.

<span id="an_12:3">12:3</span> They took him, beat him, and sent him
away empty.

<span id="an_12:4">12:4</span> Again, he sent another servant to them;
and they threw stones at him, wounded him in the head, and sent him away
shamefully treated.

<span id="an_12:5">12:5</span> Again he sent another; and they killed
him; and many others, beating some, and killing some.

<span id="an_12:6">12:6</span> Therefore still having one, his beloved
son, he sent him last to them, saying, 'They will respect my son.'

<span id="an_12:7">12:7</span> But those farmers said among themselves,
'This is the heir. Come, let's kill him, and the inheritance will be
ours.'

<span id="an_12:8">12:8</span> They took him, killed him, and cast him
out of the vineyard.

<span id="an_12:9">12:9</span> What therefore will the lord of the
vineyard do? He will come and destroy the farmers, and will give the
vineyard to others.

<span id="an_12:10">12:10</span> Haven't you even read this Scripture:
'The stone which the builders rejected, the same was made the head of
the corner.

<span id="an_12:11">12:11</span> This was from the Lord, it is marvelous
in our eyes'?"

<span id="an_12:12">12:12</span> They tried to seize him, but they
feared the multitude; for they perceived that he spoke the parable
against them. They left him, and went away.

<span id="an_12:13">12:13</span> They sent some of the Pharisees and of
the Herodians to him, that they might trap him with words.

<span id="an_12:14">12:14</span> When they had come, they asked him,
"Teacher, we know that you are honest, and don't defer to anyone; for
you aren't partial to anyone, but truly teach the way of God. Is it
lawful to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?

<span id="an_12:15">12:15</span> Shall we give, or shall we not give?"
But he, knowing their hypocrisy, said to them, "Why do you test me?
Bring me a denarius, that I may see it."

<span id="an_12:16">12:16</span> They brought it. He said to them,
"Whose is this image and inscription?" They said to him, "Caesar's."

<span id="an_12:17">12:17</span> Jesus answered them, "Render to Caesar
the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's."
They marveled greatly at him.

<span id="an_12:18">12:18</span> There came to him Sadducees, who say
that there is no resurrection. They asked him, saying,

<span id="an_12:19">12:19</span> "Teacher, Moses wrote to us, 'If a
man's brother dies, and leaves a wife behind him, and leaves no
children, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up offspring
for his brother.'

<span id="an_12:20">12:20</span> There were seven brothers. The first
took a wife, and dying left no offspring.

<span id="an_12:21">12:21</span> The second took her, and died, leaving
no children behind him. The third likewise;

<span id="an_12:22">12:22</span> and the seven took her and left no
children. Last of all the woman also died.

<span id="an_12:23">12:23</span> In the resurrection, when they rise,
whose wife will she be of them? For the seven had her as a wife."

<span id="an_12:24">12:24</span> Jesus answered them, "Isn't this
because you are mistaken, not knowing the Scriptures, nor the power of
God?

<span id="an_12:25">12:25</span> For when they will rise from the dead,
they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are like angels in
heaven.

<span id="an_12:26">12:26</span> But about the dead, that they are
raised; haven't you read in the book of Moses, about the Bush, how God
spoke to him, saying, 'I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and
the God of Jacob'?

<span id="an_12:27">12:27</span> He is not the God of the dead, but of
the living. You are therefore badly mistaken."

<span id="an_12:28">12:28</span> One of the scribes came, and heard them
questioning together. Knowing that he had answered them well, asked him,
"Which commandment is the greatest of all?"

<span id="an_12:29">12:29</span> Jesus answered, "The greatest is,
'Hear, Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is one:

<span id="an_12:30">12:30</span> you shall love the Lord your God with
all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind, and with
all your strength.' This is the first commandment.

<span id="an_12:31">12:31</span> The second is like this, 'You shall
love your neighbor as yourself.' There is no other commandment greater
than these."

<span id="an_12:32">12:32</span> The scribe said to him, "Truly,
teacher, you have said well that he is one, and there is none other but
he,

<span id="an_12:33">12:33</span> and to love him with all the heart, and
with all the understanding, with all the soul, and with all the
strength, and to love his neighbor as himself, is more important than
all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices."

<span id="an_12:34">12:34</span> When Jesus saw that he answered wisely,
he said to him, "You are not far from the Kingdom of God." No one dared
ask him any question after that.

<span id="an_12:35">12:35</span> Jesus responded, as he taught in the
temple, "How is it that the scribes say that the Christ is the son of
David?

<span id="an_12:36">12:36</span> For David himself said in the Holy
Spirit, 'The Lord said to my Lord, "Sit at my right hand, until I make
your enemies the footstool of your feet."'

<span id="an_12:37">12:37</span> Therefore David himself calls him Lord,
so how can he be his son?" The common people heard him gladly.

<span id="an_12:38">12:38</span> In his teaching he said to them,
"Beware of the scribes, who like to walk in long robes, and to get
greetings in the marketplaces,

<span id="an_12:39">12:39</span> and the best seats in the synagogues,
and the best places at feasts:

<span id="an_12:40">12:40</span> those who devour widows' houses, and
for a pretense make long prayers. These will receive greater
condemnation."

<span id="an_12:41">12:41</span> Jesus sat down opposite the treasury,
and saw how the multitude cast money into the treasury. Many who were
rich cast in much.

<span id="an_12:42">12:42</span> A poor widow came, and she cast in two
small brass coins, which equal a quadrans coin.

<span id="an_12:43">12:43</span> He called his disciples to himself, and
said to them, "Most certainly I tell you, this poor widow gave more than
all those who are giving into the treasury,

<span id="an_12:44">12:44</span> for they all gave out of their
abundance, but she, out of her poverty, gave all that she had to live
on."

<span id="an_13:1">13:1</span> As he went out of the temple, one of his
disciples said to him, "Teacher, see what kind of stones and what kind
of buildings!"

<span id="an_13:2">13:2</span> Jesus said to him, "Do you see these
great buildings? There will not be left here one stone on another, which
will not be thrown down."

<span id="an_13:3">13:3</span> As he sat on the Mount of Olives opposite
the temple, Peter, James, John, and Andrew asked him privately,

<span id="an_13:4">13:4</span> "Tell us, when will these things be? What
is the sign that these things are all about to be fulfilled?"

<span id="an_13:5">13:5</span> Jesus, answering, began to tell them, "Be
careful that no one leads you astray.

<span id="an_13:6">13:6</span> For many will come in my name, saying, 'I
am he!' and will lead many astray.

<span id="an_13:7">13:7</span> "When you hear of wars and rumors of
wars, don't be troubled. For those must happen, but the end is not yet.

<span id="an_13:8">13:8</span> For nation will rise against nation, and
kingdom against kingdom. There will be earthquakes in various places.
There will be famines and troubles. These things are the beginning of
birth pains.

<span id="an_13:9">13:9</span> But watch yourselves, for they will
deliver you up to councils. You will be beaten in synagogues. You will
stand before rulers and kings for my sake, for a testimony to them.

<span id="an_13:10">13:10</span> The Good News must first be preached to
all the nations.

<span id="an_13:11">13:11</span> When they lead you away and deliver you
up, don't be anxious beforehand, or premeditate what you will say, but
say whatever will be given you in that hour. For it is not you who
speak, but the Holy Spirit.

<span id="an_13:12">13:12</span> "Brother will deliver up brother to
death, and the father his child. Children will rise up against parents,
and cause them to be put to death.

<span id="an_13:13">13:13</span> You will be hated by all men for my
name's sake, but he who endures to the end, the same will be saved.

<span id="an_13:14">13:14</span> But when you see the abomination of
desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing where it ought not
(let the reader understand), then let those who are in Judea flee to the
mountains,

<span id="an_13:15">13:15</span> and let him who is on the housetop not
go down, nor enter in, to take anything out of his house.

<span id="an_13:16">13:16</span> Let him who is in the field not return
back to take his cloak.

<span id="an_13:17">13:17</span> But woe to those who are with child and
to those who nurse babies in those days!

<span id="an_13:18">13:18</span> Pray that your flight won't be in the
winter.

<span id="an_13:19">13:19</span> For in those days there will be
oppression, such as there has not been the like from the beginning of
the creation which God created until now, and never will be.

<span id="an_13:20">13:20</span> Unless the Lord had shortened the days,
no flesh would have been saved; but for the sake of the chosen ones,
whom he picked out, he shortened the days.

<span id="an_13:21">13:21</span> Then if anyone tells you, 'Look, here
is the Christ!' or, 'Look, there!' don't believe it.

<span id="an_13:22">13:22</span> For there will arise false christs and
false prophets, and will show signs and wonders, that they may lead
astray, if possible, even the chosen ones.

<span id="an_13:23">13:23</span> But you watch. "Behold, I have told you
all things beforehand.

<span id="an_13:24">13:24</span> But in those days, after that
oppression, the sun will be darkened, the moon will not give its light,

<span id="an_13:25">13:25</span> the stars will be falling from the sky,
and the powers that are in the heavens will be shaken.

<span id="an_13:26">13:26</span> Then they will see the Son of Man
coming in clouds with great power and glory.

<span id="an_13:27">13:27</span> Then he will send out his angels, and
will gather together his chosen ones from the four winds, from the ends
of the earth to the ends of the sky.

<span id="an_13:28">13:28</span> "Now from the fig tree, learn this
parable. When the branch has now become tender, and puts forth its
leaves, you know that the summer is near;

<span id="an_13:29">13:29</span> even so you also, when you see these
things coming to pass, know that it is near, at the doors.

<span id="an_13:30">13:30</span> Most certainly I say to you, this
generation will not pass away until all these things happen.

<span id="an_13:31">13:31</span> Heaven and earth will pass away, but my
words will not pass away.

<span id="an_13:32">13:32</span> But of that day or that hour no one
knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father.

<span id="an_13:33">13:33</span> Watch, keep alert, and pray; for you
don't know when the time is.

<span id="an_13:34">13:34</span> "It is like a man, traveling to another
country, having left his house, and given authority to his servants, and
to each one his work, and also commanded the doorkeeper to keep watch.

<span id="an_13:35">13:35</span> Watch therefore, for you don't know
when the lord of the house is coming, whether at evening, or at
midnight, or when the rooster crows, or in the morning;

<span id="an_13:36">13:36</span> lest coming suddenly he might find you
sleeping.

<span id="an_13:37">13:37</span> What I tell you, I tell all: Watch."

<span id="an_14:1">14:1</span> It was now two days before the feast of
the Passover and the unleavened bread, and the chief priests and the
scribes sought how they might seize him by deception, and kill him.

<span id="an_14:2">14:2</span> For they said, "Not during the feast,
because there might be a riot of the people."

<span id="an_14:3">14:3</span> While he was at Bethany, in the house of
Simon the leper, as he sat at the table, a woman came having an
alabaster jar of ointment of pure nard--very costly. She broke the jar,
and poured it over his head.

<span id="an_14:4">14:4</span> But there were some who were indignant
among themselves, saying, "Why has this ointment been wasted?

<span id="an_14:5">14:5</span> For this might have been sold for more
than three hundred denarii, and given to the poor." They grumbled
against her.

<span id="an_14:6">14:6</span> But Jesus said, "Leave her alone. Why do
you trouble her? She has done a good work for me.

<span id="an_14:7">14:7</span> For you always have the poor with you,
and whenever you want to, you can do them good; but you will not always
have me.

<span id="an_14:8">14:8</span> She has done what she could. She has
anointed my body beforehand for the burying.

<span id="an_14:9">14:9</span> Most certainly I tell you, wherever this
Good News may be preached throughout the whole world, that which this
woman has done will also be spoken of for a memorial of her."

<span id="an_14:10">14:10</span> Judas Iscariot, who was one of the
twelve, went away to the chief priests, that he might deliver him to
them.

<span id="an_14:11">14:11</span> They, when they heard it, were glad,
and promised to give him money. He sought how he might conveniently
deliver him.

<span id="an_14:12">14:12</span> On the first day of unleavened bread,
when they sacrificed the Passover, his disciples asked him, "Where do
you want us to go and prepare that you may eat the Passover?"

<span id="an_14:13">14:13</span> He sent two of his disciples, and said
to them, "Go into the city, and there you will meet a man carrying a
pitcher of water. Follow him,

<span id="an_14:14">14:14</span> and wherever he enters in, tell the
master of the house, 'The Teacher says, "Where is the guest room, where
I may eat the Passover with my disciples?"'

<span id="an_14:15">14:15</span> He will himself show you a large upper
room furnished and ready. Get ready for us there."

<span id="an_14:16">14:16</span> His disciples went out, and came into
the city, and found things as he had said to them, and they prepared the
Passover.

<span id="an_14:17">14:17</span> When it was evening he came with the
twelve.

<span id="an_14:18">14:18</span> As they sat and were eating, Jesus
said, "Most certainly I tell you, one of you will betray me--he who eats
with me."

<span id="an_14:19">14:19</span> They began to be sorrowful, and to ask
him one by one, "Surely not I?" And another said, "Surely not I?"

<span id="an_14:20">14:20</span> He answered them, "It is one of the
twelve, he who dips with me in the dish.

<span id="an_14:21">14:21</span> For the Son of Man goes, even as it is
written about him, but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is
betrayed! It would be better for that man if he had not been born."

<span id="an_14:22">14:22</span> As they were eating, Jesus took bread,
and when he had blessed, he broke it, and gave to them, and said, "Take,
eat. This is my body."

<span id="an_14:23">14:23</span> He took the cup, and when he had given
thanks, he gave to them. They all drank of it.

<span id="an_14:24">14:24</span> He said to them, "This is my blood of
the new covenant, which is poured out for many.

<span id="an_14:25">14:25</span> Most certainly I tell you, I will no
more drink of the fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it anew
in the Kingdom of God."

<span id="an_14:26">14:26</span> When they had sung a hymn, they went
out to the Mount of Olives.

<span id="an_14:27">14:27</span> Jesus said to them, "All of you will be
made to stumble because of me tonight, for it is written, 'I will strike
the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered.'

<span id="an_14:28">14:28</span> However, after I am raised up, I will
go before you into Galilee."

<span id="an_14:29">14:29</span> But Peter said to him, "Although all
will be offended, yet I will not."

<span id="an_14:30">14:30</span> Jesus said to him, "Most certainly I
tell you, that you today, even this night, before the rooster crows
twice, you will deny me three times."

<span id="an_14:31">14:31</span> But he spoke all the more, "If I must
die with you, I will not deny you." They all said the same thing.

<span id="an_14:32">14:32</span> They came to a place which was named
Gethsemane. He said to his disciples, "Sit here, while I pray."

<span id="an_14:33">14:33</span> He took with him Peter, James, and
John, and began to be greatly troubled and distressed.

<span id="an_14:34">14:34</span> He said to them, "My soul is
exceedingly sorrowful, even to death. Stay here, and watch."

<span id="an_14:35">14:35</span> He went forward a little, and fell on
the ground, and prayed that, if it were possible, the hour might pass
away from him.

<span id="an_14:36">14:36</span> He said, "Abba, Father, all things are
possible to you. Please remove this cup from me. However, not what I
desire, but what you desire."

<span id="an_14:37">14:37</span> He came and found them sleeping, and
said to Peter, "Simon, are you sleeping? Couldn't you watch one hour?

<span id="an_14:38">14:38</span> Watch and pray, that you may not enter
into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak."

<span id="an_14:39">14:39</span> Again he went away, and prayed, saying
the same words.

<span id="an_14:40">14:40</span> Again he returned, and found them
sleeping, for their eyes were very heavy, and they didn't know what to
answer him.

<span id="an_14:41">14:41</span> He came the third time, and said to
them, "Sleep on now, and take your rest. It is enough. The hour has
come. Behold, the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.

<span id="an_14:42">14:42</span> Arise, let us be going. Behold, he who
betrays me is at hand."

<span id="an_14:43">14:43</span> Immediately, while he was still
speaking, Judas, one of the twelve, came--and with him a multitude with
swords and clubs, from the chief priests, the scribes, and the elders.

<span id="an_14:44">14:44</span> Now he who betrayed him had given them
a sign, saying, "Whoever I will kiss, that is he. Seize him, and lead
him away safely."

<span id="an_14:45">14:45</span> When he had come, immediately he came
to him, and said, "Rabbi! Rabbi!" and kissed him.

<span id="an_14:46">14:46</span> They laid their hands on him, and
seized him.

<span id="an_14:47">14:47</span> But a certain one of those who stood by
drew his sword, and struck the servant of the high priest, and cut off
his ear.

<span id="an_14:48">14:48</span> Jesus answered them, "Have you come
out, as against a robber, with swords and clubs to seize me?

<span id="an_14:49">14:49</span> I was daily with you in the temple
teaching, and you didn't arrest me. But this is so that the Scriptures
might be fulfilled."

<span id="an_14:50">14:50</span> They all left him, and fled.

<span id="an_14:51">14:51</span> A certain young man followed him,
having a linen cloth thrown around himself, over his naked body. The
young men grabbed him,

<span id="an_14:52">14:52</span> but he left the linen cloth, and fled
from them naked.

<span id="an_14:53">14:53</span> They led Jesus away to the high priest.
All the chief priests, the elders, and the scribes came together with
him.

<span id="an_14:54">14:54</span> Peter had followed him from a distance,
until he came into the court of the high priest. He was sitting with the
officers, and warming himself in the light of the fire.

<span id="an_14:55">14:55</span> Now the chief priests and the whole
council sought witnesses against Jesus to put him to death, and found
none.

<span id="an_14:56">14:56</span> For many gave false testimony against
him, and their testimony didn't agree with each other.

<span id="an_14:57">14:57</span> Some stood up, and gave false testimony
against him, saying,

<span id="an_14:58">14:58</span> "We heard him say, 'I will destroy this
temple that is made with hands, and in three days I will build another
made without hands.'"

<span id="an_14:59">14:59</span> Even so, their testimony did not agree.

<span id="an_14:60">14:60</span> The high priest stood up in the midst,
and asked Jesus, "Have you no answer? What is it which these testify
against you?"

<span id="an_14:61">14:61</span> But he stayed quiet, and answered
nothing. Again the high priest asked him, "Are you the Christ, the Son
of the Blessed?"

<span id="an_14:62">14:62</span> Jesus said, "I am. You will see the Son
of Man sitting at the right hand of Power, and coming with the clouds of
the sky."

<span id="an_14:63">14:63</span> The high priest tore his clothes, and
said, "What further need have we of witnesses?

<span id="an_14:64">14:64</span> You have heard the blasphemy! What do
you think?" They all condemned him to be worthy of death.

<span id="an_14:65">14:65</span> Some began to spit on him, and to cover
his face, and to beat him with fists, and to tell him, "Prophesy!" The
officers struck him with the palms of their hands.

<span id="an_14:66">14:66</span> As Peter was in the courtyard below,
one of the maids of the high priest came,

<span id="an_14:67">14:67</span> and seeing Peter warming himself, she
looked at him, and said, "You were also with the Nazarene, Jesus!"

<span id="an_14:68">14:68</span> But he denied it, saying, "I neither
know, nor understand what you are saying." He went out on the porch, and
the rooster crowed.

<span id="an_14:69">14:69</span> The maid saw him, and began again to
tell those who stood by, "This is one of them."

<span id="an_14:70">14:70</span> But he again denied it. After a little
while again those who stood by said to Peter, "You truly are one of
them, for you are a Galilean, and your speech shows it."

<span id="an_14:71">14:71</span> But he began to curse, and to swear, "I
don't know this man of whom you speak!"

<span id="an_14:72">14:72</span> The rooster crowed the second time.
Peter remembered the word, how that Jesus said to him, "Before the
rooster crows twice, you will deny me three times." When he thought
about that, he wept.

<span id="an_15:1">15:1</span> Immediately in the morning the chief
priests, with the elders and scribes, and the whole council, held a
consultation, and bound Jesus, and carried him away, and delivered him
up to Pilate.

<span id="an_15:2">15:2</span> Pilate asked him, "Are you the King of
the Jews?" He answered, "So you say."

<span id="an_15:3">15:3</span> The chief priests accused him of many
things.

<span id="an_15:4">15:4</span> Pilate again asked him, "Have you no
answer? See how many things they testify against you!"

<span id="an_15:5">15:5</span> But Jesus made no further answer, so that
Pilate marveled.

<span id="an_15:6">15:6</span> Now at the feast he used to release to
them one prisoner, whom they asked of him.

<span id="an_15:7">15:7</span> There was one called Barabbas, bound with
those who had made insurrection, men who in the insurrection had
committed murder.

<span id="an_15:8">15:8</span> The multitude, crying aloud, began to ask
him to do as he always did for them.

<span id="an_15:9">15:9</span> Pilate answered them, saying, "Do you
want me to release to you the King of the Jews?"

<span id="an_15:10">15:10</span> For he perceived that for envy the
chief priests had delivered him up.

<span id="an_15:11">15:11</span> But the chief priests stirred up the
multitude, that he should release Barabbas to them instead.

<span id="an_15:12">15:12</span> Pilate again asked them, "What then
should I do to him whom you call the King of the Jews?"

<span id="an_15:13">15:13</span> They cried out again, "Crucify him!"

<span id="an_15:14">15:14</span> Pilate said to them, "Why, what evil
has he done?" But they cried out exceedingly, "Crucify him!"

<span id="an_15:15">15:15</span> Pilate, wishing to please the
multitude, released Barabbas to them, and handed over Jesus, when he had
flogged him, to be crucified.

<span id="an_15:16">15:16</span> The soldiers led him away within the
court, which is the Praetorium; and they called together the whole
cohort.

<span id="an_15:17">15:17</span> They clothed him with purple, and
weaving a crown of thorns, they put it on him.

<span id="an_15:18">15:18</span> They began to salute him, "Hail, King
of the Jews!"

<span id="an_15:19">15:19</span> They struck his head with a reed, and
spat on him, and bowing their knees, did homage to him.

<span id="an_15:20">15:20</span> When they had mocked him, they took the
purple off of him, and put his own garments on him. They led him out to
crucify him.

<span id="an_15:21">15:21</span> They compelled one passing by, coming
from the country, Simon of Cyrene, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to
go with them, that he might bear his cross.

<span id="an_15:22">15:22</span> They brought him to the place called
Golgotha, which is, being interpreted, "The place of a skull."

<span id="an_15:23">15:23</span> They offered him wine mixed with myrrh
to drink, but he didn't take it.

<span id="an_15:24">15:24</span> Crucifying him, they parted his
garments among them, casting lots on them, what each should take.

<span id="an_15:25">15:25</span> It was the third hour, and they
crucified him.

<span id="an_15:26">15:26</span> The superscription of his accusation
was written over him, "THE KING OF THE JEWS."

<span id="an_15:27">15:27</span> With him they crucified two robbers;
one on his right hand, and one on his left.

<span id="an_15:28">15:28</span> The Scripture was fulfilled, which
says, "He was numbered with transgressors."

<span id="an_15:29">15:29</span> Those who passed by blasphemed him,
wagging their heads, and saying, "Ha! You who destroy the temple, and
build it in three days,

<span id="an_15:30">15:30</span> save yourself, and come down from the
cross!"

<span id="an_15:31">15:31</span> Likewise, also the chief priests
mocking among themselves with the scribes said, "He saved others. He
can't save himself.

<span id="an_15:32">15:32</span> Let the Christ, the King of Israel, now
come down from the cross, that we may see and believe him." Those who
were crucified with him insulted him.

<span id="an_15:33">15:33</span> When the sixth hour had come, there was
darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour.

<span id="an_15:34">15:34</span> At the ninth hour Jesus cried with a
loud voice, saying, "Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?" which is, being
interpreted, "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"

<span id="an_15:35">15:35</span> Some of those who stood by, when they
heard it, said, "Behold, he is calling Elijah."

<span id="an_15:36">15:36</span> One ran, and filling a sponge full of
vinegar, put it on a reed, and gave it to him to drink, saying, "Let him
be. Let's see whether Elijah comes to take him down."

<span id="an_15:37">15:37</span> Jesus cried out with a loud voice, and
gave up the spirit.

<span id="an_15:38">15:38</span> The veil of the temple was torn in two
from the top to the bottom.

<span id="an_15:39">15:39</span> When the centurion, who stood by
opposite him, saw that he cried out like this and breathed his last, he
said, "Truly this man was the Son of God!"

<span id="an_15:40">15:40</span> There were also women watching from
afar, among whom were both Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James
the less and of Joses, and Salome;

<span id="an_15:41">15:41</span> who, when he was in Galilee, followed
him, and served him; and many other women who came up with him to
Jerusalem.

<span id="an_15:42">15:42</span> When evening had now come, because it
was the Preparation Day, that is, the day before the Sabbath,

<span id="an_15:43">15:43</span> Joseph of Arimathaea, a prominent
council member who also himself was looking for the Kingdom of God,
came. He boldly went in to Pilate, and asked for Jesus' body.

<span id="an_15:44">15:44</span> Pilate marveled if he were already
dead; and summoning the centurion, he asked him whether he had been dead
long.

<span id="an_15:45">15:45</span> When he found out from the centurion,
he granted the body to Joseph.

<span id="an_15:46">15:46</span> He bought a linen cloth, and taking him
down, wound him in the linen cloth, and laid him in a tomb which had
been cut out of a rock. He rolled a stone against the door of the tomb.

<span id="an_15:47">15:47</span> Mary Magdalene and Mary, the mother of
Joses, saw where he was laid.

<span id="an_16:1">16:1</span> When the Sabbath was past, Mary
Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James, and Salome, bought spices, that
they might come and anoint him.

<span id="an_16:2">16:2</span> Very early on the first day of the week,
they came to the tomb when the sun had risen.

<span id="an_16:3">16:3</span> They were saying among themselves, "Who
will roll away the stone from the door of the tomb for us?"

<span id="an_16:4">16:4</span> for it was very big. Looking up, they saw
that the stone was rolled back.

<span id="an_16:5">16:5</span> Entering into the tomb, they saw a young
man sitting on the right side, dressed in a white robe, and they were
amazed.

<span id="an_16:6">16:6</span> He said to them, "Don't be amazed. You
seek Jesus, the Nazarene, who has been crucified. He has risen. He is
not here. Behold, the place where they laid him!

<span id="an_16:7">16:7</span> But go, tell his disciples and Peter, 'He
goes before you into Galilee. There you will see him, as he said to
you.'"

<span id="an_16:8">16:8</span> They went out, and fled from the tomb,
for trembling and astonishment had come on them. They said nothing to
anyone; for they were afraid.

<span id="an_16:9">16:9</span> Now when he had risen early on the first
day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, from whom he had
cast out seven demons.

<span id="an_16:10">16:10</span> She went and told those who had been
with him, as they mourned and wept.

<span id="an_16:11">16:11</span> When they heard that he was alive, and
had been seen by her, they disbelieved.

<span id="an_16:12">16:12</span> After these things he was revealed in
another form to two of them, as they walked, on their way into the
country.

<span id="an_16:13">16:13</span> They went away and told it to the rest.
They didn't believe them, either.

<span id="an_16:14">16:14</span> Afterward he was revealed to the eleven
themselves as they sat at the table, and he rebuked them for their
unbelief and hardness of heart, because they didn't believe those who
had seen him after he had risen.

<span id="an_16:15">16:15</span> He said to them, "Go into all the
world, and preach the Good News to the whole creation.

<span id="an_16:16">16:16</span> He who believes and is baptized will be
saved; but he who disbelieves will be condemned.

<span id="an_16:17">16:17</span> These signs will accompany those who
believe: in my name they will cast out demons; they will speak with new
languages;

<span id="an_16:18">16:18</span> they will take up serpents; and if they
drink any deadly thing, it will in no way hurt them; they will lay hands
on the sick, and they will recover."

<span id="an_16:19">16:19</span> So then the Lord, after he had spoken
to them, was received up into heaven, and sat down at the right hand of
God.

<span id="an_16:20">16:20</span> They went out, and preached everywhere,
the Lord working with them, and confirming the word by the signs that
followed. Amen.
