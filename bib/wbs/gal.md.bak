### Webster's Bible: Galatians

<span id="an_1:1">1:1</span> Paul, an apostle, (not from men, neither by
man, but by Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the
dead;)

<span id="an_1:2">1:2</span> And all the brethren who are with me, to
the churches of Galatia:

<span id="an_1:3">1:3</span> Grace be to you and peace from God the
Father, and from our Lord Jesus Christ,

<span id="an_1:4">1:4</span> Who gave himself for our sins, that he
might deliver us from this present evil world, according to the will of
God and our Father:

<span id="an_1:5">1:5</span> To whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.

<span id="an_1:6">1:6</span> I marvel that ye are so soon removed from
him that called you into the grace of Christ, to another gospel:

<span id="an_1:7">1:7</span> Which is not another; but there are some
that trouble you, and would pervert the gospel of Christ.

<span id="an_1:8">1:8</span> But though we, or an angel from heaven,
should preach any other gospel to you than that which we have preached
to you, let him be accursed.

<span id="an_1:9">1:9</span> As we said before, so I say now again, If
any man preacheth any other gospel to you than that ye have received,
let him be accursed.

<span id="an_1:10">1:10</span> For do I now persuade men, or God? or do
I seek to please men? for if I yet pleased men, I should not be the
servant of Christ.

<span id="an_1:11">1:11</span> But I certify you, brethren, that the
gospel which was preached by me is not according to man.

<span id="an_1:12">1:12</span> For I neither received it from man,
neither was I taught it, but by the revelation of Jesus Christ.

<span id="an_1:13">1:13</span> For ye have heard of my manner of life in
time past in the Jews' religion, that beyond measure I persecuted the
church of God, and wasted it;

<span id="an_1:14">1:14</span> And profited in the Jews' religion above
many my equals in my own nation, being more exceedingly zealous of the
traditions of my fathers.

<span id="an_1:15">1:15</span> But when it pleased God, who separated me
from my mother's womb, and called me by his grace,

<span id="an_1:16">1:16</span> To reveal his Son in me, that I might
preach him among the heathen; immediately I conferred not with flesh and
blood:

<span id="an_1:17">1:17</span> Neither did I go to Jerusalem to them who
were apostles before me: but I went into Arabia, and returned again to
Damascus.

<span id="an_1:18">1:18</span> Then after three years I went to
Jerusalem to see Peter, and abode with him fifteen days.

<span id="an_1:19">1:19</span> But I saw no other of the apostles, save
James the Lord's brother.

<span id="an_1:20">1:20</span> Now the things which I write to you,
behold, before God, I lie not.

<span id="an_1:21">1:21</span> Afterwards I came into the regions of
Syria and Cilicia;

<span id="an_1:22">1:22</span> And was unknown by face to the churches
of Judea which were in Christ:

<span id="an_1:23">1:23</span> But they had heard only, That he who
persecuted us in times past, now preacheth the faith which once he
destroyed.

<span id="an_1:24">1:24</span> And they glorified God in me.

<span id="an_2:1">2:1</span> Then fourteen years after I went again to
Jerusalem with Barnabas, and took Titus with me also.

<span id="an_2:2">2:2</span> And I went by revelation, and communicated
to them that gospel which I preach among the Gentiles, but privately to
them who were of reputation, lest by any means I should run, or had run
in vain.

<span id="an_2:3">2:3</span> But neither Titus, who was with me, being a
Greek, was compelled to be circumcised:

<span id="an_2:4">2:4</span> And that because of false brethren unawares
brought in, who came in privately to spy out our liberty which we have
in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into bondage:

<span id="an_2:5">2:5</span> To whom we gave place by subjection, no,
not for an hour; that the truth of the gospel might continue with you.

<span id="an_2:6">2:6</span> But of these, who seemed to be somewhat,
(whatever they were, it maketh no matter to me: God accepteth no man's
person:) for they who seemed to be somewhat, in conference added nothing
to me:

<span id="an_2:7">2:7</span> But on the contrary, when they saw that the
gospel of the uncircumcision was committed to me, as the gospel of the
circumcision was to Peter;

<span id="an_2:8">2:8</span> (For he that wrought effectually in Peter
to the apostleship of the circumcision, the same was mighty in me
towards the Gentiles:)

<span id="an_2:9">2:9</span> And when James, Cephas, and John, who
seemed to be pillars, perceived the grace that was given to me, they
gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship; that we should go
to the heathen, and they to the circumcision.

<span id="an_2:10">2:10</span> Only they would that we should remember
the poor; the same which I also was forward to do.

<span id="an_2:11">2:11</span> But when Peter had come to Antioch, I
withstood him to the face, because he was to be blamed.

<span id="an_2:12">2:12</span> For before that certain came from James,
he used to eat with the Gentiles: but when they had come, he withdrew,
and separated himself, fearing them who were of the circumcision.

<span id="an_2:13">2:13</span> And the other Jews dissembled likewise
with him; so that Barnabas also was carried away with their
dissimulation.

<span id="an_2:14">2:14</span> But when I saw that they walked not
uprightly according to the truth of the gospel, I said to Peter before
them all, If thou, being a Jew, livest after the manner of Gentiles, and
not as do the Jews, why compellest thou the Gentiles to live as do the
Jews?

<span id="an_2:15">2:15</span> We who are Jews by nature, and not
sinners of the Gentiles,

<span id="an_2:16">2:16</span> Knowing that a man is not justified by
the works of the law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ, even we have
believed in Jesus Christ, that we may be justified by the faith of
Christ, and not by the works of the law: for by the works of the law
shall no flesh be justified.

<span id="an_2:17">2:17</span> But if, while we seek to be justified by
Christ, we ourselves also are found sinners, is therefore Christ the
minister of sin? By no means.

<span id="an_2:18">2:18</span> For if I build again the things which I
destroyed, I make myself a transgressor.

<span id="an_2:19">2:19</span> For I through the law am dead to the law,
that I may live to God.

<span id="an_2:20">2:20</span> I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless,
I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now
live in the flesh, I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me,
and gave himself for me.

<span id="an_2:21">2:21</span> I do not frustrate the grace of God: for
if righteousness is attainable by the law, then Christ hath died in
vain.

<span id="an_3:1">3:1</span> O foolish Galatians, who hath bewitched
you, that ye should not obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ
hath been evidently set forth, crucified among you?

<span id="an_3:2">3:2</span> This only would I learn from you, Received
ye the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?

<span id="an_3:3">3:3</span> Are ye so foolish? having begun in the
Spirit, are ye now made perfect by the flesh?

<span id="an_3:4">3:4</span> Have ye suffered so many things in vain? if
it is yet in vain.

<span id="an_3:5">3:5</span> He therefore that ministereth to you the
Spirit, and worketh miracles among you, doeth he this by the works of
the law, or by the hearing of faith?

<span id="an_3:6">3:6</span> Even as Abraham believed God, and it was
accounted to him for righteousness.

<span id="an_3:7">3:7</span> Know ye therefore, that they who are of
faith, the same are the children of Abraham.

<span id="an_3:8">3:8</span> And the scripture foreseeing that God would
justify the heathen through faith, preached before the gospel to
Abraham, saying, In thee shall all nations be blessed.

<span id="an_3:9">3:9</span> So then they who are of faith are blessed
with faithful Abraham.

<span id="an_3:10">3:10</span> For as many as are of the works of the
law, are under the curse: for it is written, Accursed is every one that
continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law to
do them.

<span id="an_3:11">3:11</span> But that no man is justified by the law
in the sight of God, is evident: for, The just shall live by faith.

<span id="an_3:12">3:12</span> And the law is not of faith: but, The man
that doeth them shall live by them.

<span id="an_3:13">3:13</span> Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of
the law, being made a curse for us: for it is written, Accursed is every
one that hangeth on a tree:

<span id="an_3:14">3:14</span> That the blessing of Abraham might come
on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ; that we might receive the promise
of the Spirit through faith.

<span id="an_3:15">3:15</span> Brethren, I speak after the manner of
men; Though it is but a man's covenant, yet if it is confirmed, no man
disannulleth or addeth to it.

<span id="an_3:16">3:16</span> Now to Abraham and his seed were the
promises made. He saith not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one,
And to thy seed, which is Christ.

<span id="an_3:17">3:17</span> And this I say, that the covenant that
was confirmed before by God in Christ, the law, which was four hundred
and thirty years after, cannot disannul, that it should make the promise
of no effect.

<span id="an_3:18">3:18</span> For if the inheritance is by the law, it
is no more by promise: but God gave it to Abraham by promise.

<span id="an_3:19">3:19</span> What purpose then serveth the law? It was
added because of transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the
promise was made; and it was ordained by angels in the hand of a
mediator.

<span id="an_3:20">3:20</span> Now a mediator is not a mediator of one;
but God is one.

<span id="an_3:21">3:21</span> Is the law then against the promises of
God? By no means: for if there had been a law given which could give
life, verily righteousness would have been by the law.

<span id="an_3:22">3:22</span> But the scripture hath concluded all
under sin, that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to
them that believe.

<span id="an_3:23">3:23</span> But before faith came, we were kept under
the law, shut up to the faith which should afterwards be revealed.

<span id="an_3:24">3:24</span> Wherefore the law was our school-master
to bring us to Christ, that we might be justified by faith.

<span id="an_3:25">3:25</span> But after faith is come, we are no longer
under a school-master.

<span id="an_3:26">3:26</span> For ye are all children of God by faith
in Christ Jesus.

<span id="an_3:27">3:27</span> For as many of you as have been baptized
into Christ, have put on Christ.

<span id="an_3:28">3:28</span> There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is
neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all
one in Christ Jesus.

<span id="an_3:29">3:29</span> And if ye are Christ's, then are ye
Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise.

<span id="an_4:1">4:1</span> Now I say, That the heir, as long as he is
a child, differeth nothing from a servant, though he is lord of all;

<span id="an_4:2">4:2</span> But is under tutors and governors until the
time appointed by the father.

<span id="an_4:3">4:3</span> Even so we, when we were children, were in
bondage under the elements of the world:

<span id="an_4:4">4:4</span> But when the fullness of the time was come,
God sent forth his Son, born of a woman, born under the law,

<span id="an_4:5">4:5</span> To redeem them that were under the law,
that we might receive the adoption of sons.

<span id="an_4:6">4:6</span> And because ye are sons, God hath sent
forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father.

<span id="an_4:7">4:7</span> Wherefore thou art no more a servant, but a
son; and if a son, then an heir of God through Christ.

<span id="an_4:8">4:8</span> However then, when ye knew not God, ye did
service to them which by nature are no gods.

<span id="an_4:9">4:9</span> But now, after ye have known God, or rather
are known by God, how turn ye again to the weak and beggarly elements,
to which ye desire again to be in bondage?

<span id="an_4:10">4:10</span> Ye observe days, and months, and times,
and years.

<span id="an_4:11">4:11</span> I am afraid of you, lest I have bestowed
upon you labor in vain.

<span id="an_4:12">4:12</span> Brethren, I beseech you, be as I am; for
I am as ye are: ye have not injured me at all.

<span id="an_4:13">4:13</span> Ye know that in infirmity of the flesh I
preached the gospel to you at the first.

<span id="an_4:14">4:14</span> And my temptation which was in my flesh
ye despised not, nor rejected; but received me as an angel of God, even
as Christ Jesus.

<span id="an_4:15">4:15</span> What then was the blessedness ye spoke
of; for I bear you testimony, that, if it had been possible, ye would
have plucked out your own eyes, and have given them to me.

<span id="an_4:16">4:16</span> Am I therefore become your enemy because
I tell you the truth?

<span id="an_4:17">4:17</span> They zealously affect you, but not well;
for, they would exclude you, that ye may affect them.

<span id="an_4:18">4:18</span> But it is good to be zealously affected
always in a good thing, and not only when I am present with you.

<span id="an_4:19">4:19</span> My little children, of whom I travail in
birth again, until Christ be formed in you,

<span id="an_4:20">4:20</span> I desire to be present with you now, and
to change my voice; for I stand in doubt of you.

<span id="an_4:21">4:21</span> Tell me, ye that desire to be under the
law, do ye not hear the law?

<span id="an_4:22">4:22</span> For it is written, that Abraham had two
sons; the one by a bond-maid, the other by a free-woman.

<span id="an_4:23">4:23</span> But he who was of the bond-woman, was
born according to the flesh; but he of the free-woman was by promise.

<span id="an_4:24">4:24</span> Which things are an allegory: for these
are the two covenants; the one from the mount Sinai, which gendereth to
bondage, which is Agar.

<span id="an_4:25">4:25</span> For this Agar is mount Sinai in Arabia,
and answereth to Jerusalem which now is, and is in bondage with her
children.

<span id="an_4:26">4:26</span> But Jerusalem which is above is free,
which is the mother of us all.

<span id="an_4:27">4:27</span> For it is written, Rejoice, thou barren
that bearest not; break forth and cry, thou that travailest not: for the
desolate hath many more children than she who hath a husband.

<span id="an_4:28">4:28</span> Now we, brethren, as Isaac was, are the
children of promise.

<span id="an_4:29">4:29</span> But as then he that was born according to
the flesh persecuted him that was born according to the Spirit, even so
it is now.

<span id="an_4:30">4:30</span> Nevertheless, what saith the scripture?
Cast out the bond-woman and her son: for the son of the bond-woman shall
not be heir with the son of the free-woman.

<span id="an_4:31">4:31</span> So then, brethren, we are not children of
the bond-woman, but of the free.

<span id="an_5:1">5:1</span> Stand fast therefore in the liberty with
which Christ hath made us free, and be not entangled again with the yoke
of bondage.

<span id="an_5:2">5:2</span> Behold, I Paul say to you, that if ye be
circumcised, Christ will profit you nothing.

<span id="an_5:3">5:3</span> For I testify again to every man that is
circumcised, that he is a debtor to do the whole law.

<span id="an_5:4">5:4</span> Christ is become of no effect to you,
whoever of you are justified by the law; ye have fallen from grace.

<span id="an_5:5">5:5</span> For we through the Spirit wait for the hope
of righteousness by faith.

<span id="an_5:6">5:6</span> For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision
availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision; but faith which worketh by love.

<span id="an_5:7">5:7</span> Ye did run well, who hindered you that ye
should not obey the truth?

<span id="an_5:8">5:8</span> This persuasion cometh not from him that
calleth you.

<span id="an_5:9">5:9</span> A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump.

<span id="an_5:10">5:10</span> I have confidence in you through the
Lord, that ye will be no otherwise minded: but he that troubleth you
shall bear his judgment, whoever he may be.

<span id="an_5:11">5:11</span> And I, brethren, if I yet preach
circumcision, why do I yet suffer persecution? then hath the offense of
the cross ceased.

<span id="an_5:12">5:12</span> I would they were even cut off who
trouble you.

<span id="an_5:13">5:13</span> For, brethren, ye have been called to
liberty; only use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh, but by love
serve one another.

<span id="an_5:14">5:14</span> For all the law is fulfilled in one word,
even in this, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.

<span id="an_5:15">5:15</span> But if ye bite and devour one another,
take heed that ye be not consumed one by another.

<span id="an_5:16">5:16</span> This I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and
ye will not fulfill the lust of the flesh.

<span id="an_5:17">5:17</span> For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit,
and the Spirit against the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the
other; so that ye cannot do the things that ye would.

<span id="an_5:18">5:18</span> But if ye are led by the Spirit, ye are
not under the law.

<span id="an_5:19">5:19</span> Now the works of the flesh are manifest,
which are these, Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness,

<span id="an_5:20">5:20</span> Idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance,
emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies,

<span id="an_5:21">5:21</span> Envyings, murders, drunkenness,
revelings, and such like: of which I tell you before, as I have also
told you in time past, that they who do such things shall not inherit
the kingdom of God.

<span id="an_5:22">5:22</span> But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy,
peace, long-suffering, gentleness, goodness, faith,

<span id="an_5:23">5:23</span> Meekness, temperance: against such there
is no law.

<span id="an_5:24">5:24</span> And they that are Christ's have crucified
the flesh, with the affections and lusts.

<span id="an_5:25">5:25</span> If we live in the Spirit, let us also
walk in the Spirit.

<span id="an_5:26">5:26</span> Let us not be desirous of vain-glory,
provoking one another, envying one another.

<span id="an_6:1">6:1</span> Brethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault,
ye who are spiritual, restore such one in the spirit of meekness;
considering thyself, lest thou also be tempted.

<span id="an_6:2">6:2</span> Bear ye one another's burdens, and so
fulfill the law of Christ.

<span id="an_6:3">6:3</span> For if a man thinketh himself to be
something, when he is nothing, he deceiveth himself.

<span id="an_6:4">6:4</span> But let every man prove his own work, and
then shall he have rejoicing in himself alone, and not in another.

<span id="an_6:5">6:5</span> For every man shall bear his own burden.

<span id="an_6:6">6:6</span> Let him that is taught in the word
communicate to him that teacheth in all good things.

<span id="an_6:7">6:7</span> Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for
whatever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.

<span id="an_6:8">6:8</span> For he that soweth to his flesh shall from
the flesh reap corruption: but he that soweth to the Spirit, shall from
the Spirit reap life everlasting.

<span id="an_6:9">6:9</span> And let us not be weary in well-doing: for
in due season we shall reap, if we faint not.

<span id="an_6:10">6:10</span> As we have therefore opportunity, let us
do good to all men, especially to them who are of the household of
faith.

<span id="an_6:11">6:11</span> Ye see how large a letter I have written
to you with my own hand.

<span id="an_6:12">6:12</span> As many as desire to make a fair show in
the flesh, they constrain you to be circumcised; only lest they should
suffer persecution for the cross of Christ.

<span id="an_6:13">6:13</span> For neither they themselves who are
circumcised keep the law; but desire to have you circumcised, that they
may glory in your flesh.

<span id="an_6:14">6:14</span> But may it never be that I should glory,
save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is
crucified to me, and I to the world.

<span id="an_6:15">6:15</span> For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision
availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision, but a new creature.

<span id="an_6:16">6:16</span> And as many as walk according to this
rule, peace be on them, and mercy, and upon the Israel of God.

<span id="an_6:17">6:17</span> From henceforth let no man trouble me:
for I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus.

<span id="an_6:18">6:18</span> Brethren, the grace of our Lord Jesus
Christ be with your spirit. Amen.
