### Webster's Bible: 3 John

<span id="an_1:1">1:1</span> The elder to the well-beloved Gaius, whom I
love in truth.

<span id="an_1:2">1:2</span> Beloved, I wish above all things that thou
mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth.

<span id="an_1:3">1:3</span> For I rejoiced greatly, when the brethren
came and testified of the truth that is in thee, even as thou walkest in
the truth.

<span id="an_1:4">1:4</span> I have no greater joy than to hear that my
children walk in truth.

<span id="an_1:5">1:5</span> Beloved, thou doest faithfully whatever
thou doest to the brethren, and to strangers;

<span id="an_1:6">1:6</span> Who have borne testimony of thy charity
before the church: whom if thou shalt bring forward on their journey
after a godly sort, thou wilt do well:

<span id="an_1:7">1:7</span> Because for his name's sake they went
forth, taking nothing from the Gentiles.

<span id="an_1:8">1:8</span> We therefore ought to receive such, that we
may be fellow-helpers to the truth.

<span id="an_1:9">1:9</span> I wrote to the church: but Diotrephes, who
loveth to have the pre-eminence among them, receiveth us not.

<span id="an_1:10">1:10</span> Wherefore, if I come, I will remember his
deeds which he doeth, prating against us with malicious words: and not
content with that, neither doth he himself receive the brethren, and
forbiddeth them that would, and casteth them out of the church.

<span id="an_1:11">1:11</span> Beloved, follow not that which is evil,
but that which is good. He that doeth good is of God: but he that doeth
evil hath not seen God.

<span id="an_1:12">1:12</span> Demetrius hath good report by all men,
and by the truth itself: and we also bear testimony; and ye know that
our testimony is true.

<span id="an_1:13">1:13</span> I had many things to write, but I will
not with ink and pen write to thee:

<span id="an_1:14">1:14</span> But I trust I shall shortly see thee, and
we shall speak face to face.

<span id="an_1:15">1:15</span> Peace be to thee. Our friends salute
thee. Greet the friends by name.
