### Webster's Bible: 2 John

<span id="an_1:1">1:1</span> The elder to the elect lady, and her
children, whom I love in the truth; and not I only, but also all they
that have known the truth;

<span id="an_1:2">1:2</span> For the truth's sake which dwelleth in us,
and shall be with us for ever.

<span id="an_1:3">1:3</span> Grace be with you, mercy, and peace from
God the Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father,
in truth and love.

<span id="an_1:4">1:4</span> I rejoiced greatly, that I found of thy
children walking in truth, as we have received a commandment from the
Father.

<span id="an_1:5">1:5</span> And now I beseech thee, lady, not as though
I wrote a new commandment to thee, but that which we had from the
beginning, that we love one another.

<span id="an_1:6">1:6</span> And this is love, that we walk according to
his commandments. This is the commandment, that as ye have heard from
the beginning, ye should walk in it.

<span id="an_1:7">1:7</span> For many deceivers have entered into the
world, who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh. This is a
deceiver, and an antichrist.

<span id="an_1:8">1:8</span> Look to yourselves, that we lose not those
things which we have wrought, but that we receive a full reward.

<span id="an_1:9">1:9</span> Whoever transgresseth, and abideth not in
the doctrine of Christ, hath not God. He that abideth in the doctrine of
Christ, he hath both the Father and the Son.

<span id="an_1:10">1:10</span> If any one cometh to you, and bringeth
not this doctrine, receive him not into your house, neither wish him
happiness:

<span id="an_1:11">1:11</span> For he that wisheth him happiness, is
partaker of his evil deeds.

<span id="an_1:12">1:12</span> Having many things to write to you, I
would not write with paper and ink: but I trust to come to you, and
speak face to face, that our joy may be full.

<span id="an_1:13">1:13</span> The children of thy elect sister greet
thee. Amen.
