<span id="an_4:35">4:35</span> And Joel, and Jehu the son of Josibiah,
the son of Seraiah, the son of Asiel,

<span id="an_4:36">4:36</span> And Elioenai, and Jaakobah, and
Jeshohaiah, and Asaiah, and Adiel, and Jesimiel, and Benaiah,

<span id="an_4:37">4:37</span> And Ziza the son of Shiphi, the son of
Allon, the son of Jedaiah, the son of Shimri, the son of Shemaiah;

<span id="an_4:38">4:38</span> These mentioned by their names were
princes in their families: and the house of their fathers increased
greatly.

<span id="an_4:39">4:39</span> And they went to the entrance of Gedor,
even to the east side of the valley, to seek pasture for their flocks.

<span id="an_4:40">4:40</span> And they found rich pasture and good, and
the land was wide, and quiet, and peaceable; for they of Ham had dwelt
there of old.

<span id="an_4:41">4:41</span> And these written by name came in the
days of Hezekiah king of Judah, and smote their tents, and the
habitations that were found there, and destroyed them utterly to this
day, and dwelt in their room: because there was pasture there for their
flocks.

<span id="an_4:42">4:42</span> And some of them, even of the sons of
Simeon, five hundred men, went to mount Seir, having for their captains
Pelatiah, and Neariah, and Rephaiah, and Uzziel, the sons of Ishi.

<span id="an_4:43">4:43</span> And they smote the rest of the Amalekites
that had escaped, and have dwelt there to this day.

<span id="an_5:1">5:1</span> Now the sons of Reuben the first-born of
Israel, (for he was the first-born; but, forasmuch as he defiled his
father's bed, his birth-right was given to the sons of Joseph the son of
Israel: and the genealogy is not to be reckoned after the birth-right.

<span id="an_5:2">5:2</span> For Judah prevailed above his brethren, and
of him came the chief ruler; but the birth-right was Joseph's:)

<span id="an_5:3">5:3</span> The sons, I say, of Reuben the first-born
of Israel were, Hanoch, and Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi.

<span id="an_5:4">5:4</span> The sons of Joel; Shemaiah his son, Gog his
son, Shimei his son,

<span id="an_5:5">5:5</span> Micah his son, Reaia his son, Baal his son,

<span id="an_5:6">5:6</span> Beerah his son, whom Tilgath-pilneser king
of Assyria carried away captive: he was prince of the Reubenites.

<span id="an_5:7">5:7</span> And his brethren by their families, when
the genealogy of their generations was reckoned, were the chief, Jeiel,
and Zechariah,

<span id="an_5:8">5:8</span> And Bela the son of Azaz, the son of Shema,
the son of Joel, who dwelt in Aroer, even to Nebo, and Baal-meon:

<span id="an_5:9">5:9</span> And eastward he inhabited to the entrance
of the wilderness from the river Euphrates: because their cattle were
multiplied in the land of Gilead.

<span id="an_5:10">5:10</span> And in the days of Saul they made war
with the Hagarites, who fell by their hand: and they dwelt in their
tents throughout all the east land of Gilead.

<span id="an_5:11">5:11</span> And the children of Gad dwelt over
against them, in the land of Bashan to Salcah:

<span id="an_5:12">5:12</span> Joel the chief, and Shapham the next, and
Jaanai, and Shaphat in Bashan.

<span id="an_5:13">5:13</span> And their brethren of the house of their
fathers were, Michael, and Meshullam, and Sheba, and Jorai, and Jachan,
and Zia, and Heber, seven.

<span id="an_5:14">5:14</span> These are the children of Abihail the son
of Huri, the son of Jaroah, the son of Gilead, the son of Michael, the
son of Jeshishai, the son of Jahdo, the son of Buz;

<span id="an_5:15">5:15</span> Ahi the son of Abdiel, the son of Guni,
chief of the house of their fathers.

<span id="an_5:16">5:16</span> And they dwelt in Gilead in Bashan, and
in its towns, and in all the suburbs of Sharon, upon their borders.

<span id="an_5:17">5:17</span> All these were reckoned by genealogies in
the days of Jotham king of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam king of
Israel.

<span id="an_5:18">5:18</span> The sons of Reuben, and the Gadites, and
half the tribe of Manasseh, of valiant men, men able to bear buckler and
sword, and to shoot with bow, and skillful in war, were four and forty
thousand seven hundred and sixty, that went out to the war.

<span id="an_5:19">5:19</span> And they made war with the Hagarites,
with Jetur, and Nephish, and Nodab.

<span id="an_5:20">5:20</span> And they were helped against them, and
the Hagarites were delivered into their hand, and all that were with
them: for they cried to God in the battle, and he was entreated by them;
because they put their trust in him.

<span id="an_5:21">5:21</span> And they took away their cattle; of their
camels fifty thousand, and of sheep two hundred and fifty thousand, and
of asses two thousand, and of men a hundred thousand.

<span id="an_5:22">5:22</span> For there fell down many slain, because
the war was of God. And they dwelt in their steads until the captivity.

<span id="an_5:23">5:23</span> And the children of the half tribe of
Manasseh dwelt in the land: they increased from Bashan to Baal-hermon
and Senir, and to mount Hermon.

<span id="an_5:24">5:24</span> And these were the heads of the house of
their fathers, even Epher, and Ishi, and Eliel, and Azriel, and
Jeremiah, and Hodaviah, and Jahdiel, mighty men of valor, famous men,
and heads of the house of their fathers.

<span id="an_5:25">5:25</span> And they transgressed against the God of
their fathers, and went astray after the gods of the people of the land,
whom God destroyed before them.

<span id="an_5:26">5:26</span> And the God of Israel stirred up the
spirit of Pul king of Assyria, and the spirit of Tilgath-pilneser king
of Assyria, and he carried them away, even the Reubenites, and the
Gadites, and the half tribe of Manasseh, and brought them to Halah, and
Habor, and Hara, and to the river Gozan, to this day.

Jerusalem:)

<span id="an_6:11">6:11</span> And Azariah begat Amariah, and Amariah
begat Ahitub,

fit for war and for battle was twenty and six thousand men.

<span id="an_8:1">8:1</span> Now Benjamin begat Bela his first-born,
Ashbel the second, and Aharah the third.

<span id="an_8:2">8:2</span> Nohah the fourth, and Rapha the fifth.

<span id="an_8:3">8:3</span> And the sons of Bela were Addar, and Gera,
and Abihud,

<span id="an_8:4">8:4</span> And Abishua, and Naaman, and Ahoah,

<span id="an_8:5">8:5</span> And Gera, and Shephuphan, and Huram.

<span id="an_8:6">8:6</span> And these are the sons of Ehud: these are
the heads of the fathers of the inhabitants of Geba, and they removed
them to Manahath:

<span id="an_8:7">8:7</span> And Naaman, and Ahiah, and Gera, he removed
them, and begat Uzza, and Ahihud.

<span id="an_8:8">8:8</span> And Shaharaim begat children in the country
of Moab, after he had sent them away; Hushim and Baara were his wives.

<span id="an_8:9">8:9</span> And he begat of Hodesh his wife, Jobab, and
Zibia, and Mesha, and Malcham,

<span id="an_8:10">8:10</span> And Jeuz, and Shachia, and Mirma. These
were his sons, heads of the fathers.

<span id="an_8:11">8:11</span> And of Hushim he begat Ahitub, and
Elpaal.

<span id="an_8:12">8:12</span> The sons of Elpaal; Eber, and Misham, and
Shamed, who built Ono, and Lod, with its town:

<span id="an_8:13">8:13</span> Beriah also, and Shema, who were heads of
the fathers of the inhabitants of Ajalon, who drove away the inhabitants
of Gath:

<span id="an_8:14">8:14</span> And Ahio, Shashak, and Jeremoth,

<span id="an_8:15">8:15</span> And Zebadiah, and Arad, and Ader,

<span id="an_8:16">8:16</span> And Michael, and Ispah, and Joha, the
sons of Beriah;

<span id="an_8:17">8:17</span> And Zebadiah, and Meshullam, and Hezeki,
and Heber,

<span id="an_8:18">8:18</span> Ishmerai also, and Jezliah, and Jobab,
the sons of Elpaal;

<span id="an_8:19">8:19</span> And Jakim, and Zichri, and Zabdi,

<span id="an_8:20">8:20</span> And Elienai, and Zilthai, and Eliel,

<span id="an_8:21">8:21</span> And Adaiah, and Beraiah, and Shimrath,
the sons of Shimhi;

<span id="an_8:22">8:22</span> And Ishpan, and Heber, and Eliel,

<span id="an_8:23">8:23</span> And Abdon, and Zichri, and Hanan,

<span id="an_8:24">8:24</span> And Hananiah, and Elam, and Antothijah,

<span id="an_8:25">8:25</span> And Iphedeiah, and Penuel, the sons of
Shashak;

<span id="an_8:26">8:26</span> And Shamsherai, and Shehariah, and
Athaliah,

<span id="an_8:27">8:27</span> And Jaresiah, and Eliah, and Zichri, the
sons of Jeroham.

<span id="an_8:28">8:28</span> These were heads of the fathers, by their
generations, chief men. These dwelt in Jerusalem.

<span id="an_8:29">8:29</span> And at Gibeon dwelt the father of Gibeon;
whose wife's name was Maachah:

<span id="an_8:30">8:30</span> And his first-born son Abdon, and Zur,
and Kish, and Baal, and Nadab,

<span id="an_8:31">8:31</span> And Gedor, and Ahio, and Zacher.

<span id="an_8:32">8:32</span> And Mikloth begat Shimeah. And these also
dwelt with their brethren in Jerusalem, over against them.

<span id="an_8:33">8:33</span> And Ner begat Kish, and Kish begat Saul,
and Saul begat Jonathan, and Malchi-shua, and Abinadab, and Esh-baal.

<span id="an_8:34">8:34</span> And the son of Jonathan was Merib-baal;
and Merib-baal begat Micah.

<span id="an_8:35">8:35</span> And the sons of Micah were, Pithon, and
Melech, and Tarea, and Ahaz.

<span id="an_8:36">8:36</span> And Ahaz begat Jehoadah; and Jehoadah
begat Alemeth, and Azmaveth, and Zimri; and Zimri begat Moza,

<span id="an_8:37">8:37</span> And Moza begat Bineah: Rapha was his son,
Eleasah his son, Azel his son:

<span id="an_8:38">8:38</span> And Azel had six sons, whose names are
these, Azrikam, Bocheru, and Ishmael, and Sheariah, and Obadiah, and
Hanan. All these were the sons of Azel.

<span id="an_8:39">8:39</span> And the sons of Eshek his brother were,
Ulam his first-born, Jehush the second, and Eliphelet the third.

<span id="an_8:40">8:40</span> And the sons of Ulam were mighty men of
valor, archers, and had many sons, and sons' sons a hundred and fifty.
All these are of the sons of Benjamin.

<span id="an_9:1">9:1</span> So all Israel were reckoned by genealogies;
and behold, they were written in the book of the kings of Israel and
Judah, who were carried away to Babylon for their transgression.

<span id="an_9:2">9:2</span> Now the first inhabitants that dwelt in
their possessions in their cities were, the Israelites, the priests,
Levites, and the Nethinims.

<span id="an_9:3">9:3</span> And in Jerusalem dwelt of the children of
Judah, and of the children of Benjamin, and of the children of Ephraim,
and Manasseh;

<span id="an_9:4">9:4</span> Uthai the son of Ammihud, the son of Omri,
the son of Imri, the son of Bani, of the children of Pharez the son of
Judah.

<span id="an_9:5">9:5</span> And of the Shilonites; Asaiah the
first-born, and his sons.

<span id="an_9:6">9:6</span> And of the sons of Zerah; Jeuel, and their
brethren, six hundred and ninety.

<span id="an_9:7">9:7</span> And of the sons of Benjamin; Sallu the son
of Meshullam, the son of Hodaviah, the son of Hasenuah,

<span id="an_9:8">9:8</span> And Ibneiah the son of Jeroham, and Elah
the son of Uzzi, the son of Michri, and Meshullam the son of Shephatiah,
the son of Reuel, the son of Ibnijah;

<span id="an_9:9">9:9</span> And their brethren, according to their
generations, nine hundred and fifty and six. All these men were chief of
the fathers in the house of their fathers.

<span id="an_9:10">9:10</span> And of the priests; Jedaiah, and
Jehoiarib, and Jachin,

<span id="an_9:11">9:11</span> And Azariah the son of Hilkiah, the son
of Meshullam, the son of Zadok, the son of Meraioth, the son of Ahitub,
the ruler of the house of God;

<span id="an_9:12">9:12</span> And Adaiah the son of Jeroham, the son of
Pashur, the son of Malchijah, and Maasiai the son of Adiel, the son of
Jahzerah, the son of Meshullam, the son of Meshillemith, the son of
Immer;

<span id="an_9:13">9:13</span> And their brethren, heads of the house of
their fathers, a thousand and seven hundred and sixty; very able men for
the work of the service of the house of God.

<span id="an_9:14">9:14</span> And of the Levites; Shemaiah the son of
Hasshub, the son of Azrikam, the son of Hashabiah, of the sons of
Merari;

<span id="an_9:15">9:15</span> And Bakbakkar, Heresh, and Galal, and
Mattaniah the son of Micah, the son of Zichri, the son of Asaph;

<span id="an_9:16">9:16</span> And Obadiah the son of Shemaiah, the son
of Galal, the son of Jeduthun, and Berechiah the son of Asa, the son of
Elkanah, that dwelt in the villages of the Netophathites.

<span id="an_9:17">9:17</span> And the porters were Shallum, and Akkub,
and Talmon, and Ahiman, and their brethren: Shallum was the chief;

<span id="an_9:18">9:18</span> Who hitherto waited in the king's gate
eastward: they were porters in the companies of the children of Levi.

<span id="an_9:19">9:19</span> And Shallum the son of Kore, the son of
Ebiasaph, the son of Korah, and his brethren of the house of his father,
the Korahites, were over the work of the service, keepers of the gates
of the tabernacle: and their fathers, being over the host of the LORD,
were keepers of the entry.

<span id="an_9:20">9:20</span> And Phinehas the son of Eleazar was the
ruler over them in time past, and the LORD was with him.

<span id="an_9:21">9:21</span> And Zechariah the son of Meshelemiah was
porter of the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.

<span id="an_9:22">9:22</span> All these who were chosen to be porters
in the gates were two hundred and twelve. These were reckoned by their
genealogy in their villages, whom David and Samuel the seer ordained in
their set office.

<span id="an_9:23">9:23</span> So they and their children had the
oversight of the gates of the house of the LORD, namely, the house of
the tabernacle, by wards.

<span id="an_9:24">9:24</span> In four quarters were the porters,
towards the east, west, north and south.

<span id="an_9:25">9:25</span> And their brethren, who were in their
villages, were to come after seven days from time to time with them.

<span id="an_9:26">9:26</span> For these Levites, the four chief
porters, were in their set office, and were over the chambers and
treasuries of the house of God.

<span id="an_9:27">9:27</span> And they lodged about the house of God,
because the charge was upon them, and the opening of it every morning
pertained to them.

<span id="an_9:28">9:28</span> And certain of them had the charge of the
ministering vessels, that they should bring them in and out by number.

<span id="an_9:29">9:29</span> Some of them also were appointed to
oversee the vessels, and all the instruments of the sanctuary, and the
fine flour, and the wine, and the oil, and the frankincense, and the
spices.

<span id="an_9:30">9:30</span> And some of the sons of the priests made
the ointment of the spices.

<span id="an_9:31">9:31</span> And Mattithiah, one of the Levites, who
was the first-born of Shallum the Korahite, had the set office over the
things that were made in the pans.

<span id="an_9:32">9:32</span> And others of their brethren, of the sons
of the Kohathites, were over the show-bread, to prepare it every
sabbath.

<span id="an_9:33">9:33</span> And these are the singers, chief of the
fathers of the Levites, who remaining in the chambers were free: for
they were employed in that work day and night.

<span id="an_9:34">9:34</span> These chief fathers of the Levites were
chief throughout their generations; these dwelt at Jerusalem.

<span id="an_9:35">9:35</span> And in Gibeon dwelt the father of Gibeon,
Jehiel, whose wife's name was Maachah:

<span id="an_9:36">9:36</span> And his first-born son Abdon, then Zur,
and Kish, and Baal, and Ner, and Nadab,

<span id="an_9:37">9:37</span> And Gedor, and Ahio, and Zechariah, and
Mikloth.

<span id="an_9:38">9:38</span> And Mikloth begat Shimeam. And they also
dwelt with their brethren at Jerusalem, over against their brethren.

<span id="an_9:39">9:39</span> And Ner begat Kish; and Kish begat Saul;
and Saul begat Jonathan, and Malchi-shua, and Abinadab, and Esh-baal.

<span id="an_9:40">9:40</span> And the son of Jonathan was Merib-baal:
and Merib-baal begat Micah.

<span id="an_9:41">9:41</span> And the sons of Micah were, Pithon, and
Melech, and Tahrea, and Ahaz.

<span id="an_9:42">9:42</span> And Ahaz begat Jarah; and Jarah begat
Alemeth, and Azmaveth, and Zimri; and Zimri begat Moza;

<span id="an_9:43">9:43</span> And Moza begat Binea; and Rephaiah his
son, Eleasah his son, Azel his son.

<span id="an_9:44">9:44</span> And Azel had six sons, whose names are
these, Azrikam, Bocheru, and Ishmael, and Sheariah, and Obadiah, and
Hanan: these were the sons of Azel.

<span id="an_10:1">10:1</span> Now the Philistines fought against
Israel; and the men of Israel fled from before the Philistines, and fell
down slain in mount Gilboa.

<span id="an_10:2">10:2</span> And the Philistines followed hard after
Saul, and after his sons; and the Philistines slew Jonathan, and
Abinadab, and Malchi-shua, the sons of Saul.

<span id="an_10:3">10:3</span> And the battle prevailed against Saul,
and the archers hit him, and he was wounded by the archers.

<span id="an_10:4">10:4</span> Then said Saul to his armor-bearer, Draw
thy sword, and thrust me through therewith; lest these uncircumcised
come and abuse me. But his armor-bearer would not; for he was greatly
afraid. So Saul took a sword, and fell upon it.

<span id="an_10:5">10:5</span> And when his armor-bearer saw that Saul
was dead, he fell likewise on the sword, and died.

<span id="an_10:6">10:6</span> So Saul died, and his three sons, and all
his house died together.

<span id="an_10:7">10:7</span> And when all the men of Israel that were
in the valley saw that they fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead,
then they forsook their cities, and fled: and the Philistines came and
dwelt in them.

<span id="an_10:8">10:8</span> And it came to pass on the morrow, when
the Philistines came to strip the slain, that they found Saul and his
sons fallen in mount Gilboa.

<span id="an_10:9">10:9</span> And when they had stripped him, they took
his head, and his armor, and sent into the land of the Philistines
around, to carry tidings to their idols, and to the people.

<span id="an_10:10">10:10</span> And they put his armor in the house of
their gods, and fastened his head in the temple of Dagon.

<span id="an_10:11">10:11</span> And when all Jabesh-gilead heard all
that the Philistines had done to Saul,

<span id="an_10:12">10:12</span> They arose, all the valiant men, and
took away the body of Saul, and the bodies of his sons, and brought them
to Jabesh, and buried their bones under the oak in Jabesh, and fasted
seven days.

<span id="an_10:13">10:13</span> So Saul died for his transgression
which he committed against the LORD, even against the word of the LORD,
which he kept not, and also for asking counsel of one that had a
familiar spirit, to inquire of it;

<span id="an_10:14">10:14</span> And inquired not of the LORD: therefore
he slew him, and turned the kingdom to David the son of Jesse.

<span id="an_11:1">11:1</span> Then all Israel gathered themselves to
David to Hebron, saying, Behold, we are thy bone and thy flesh.

<span id="an_11:2">11:2</span> And moreover in time past, even when Saul
was king, thou wast he that leddest out and broughtest in Israel: and
the LORD thy God said to thee, Thou shalt feed my people Israel, and
thou shalt be ruler over my people Israel.

<span id="an_11:3">11:3</span> Therefore came all the elders of Israel
to the king to Hebron; and David made a covenant with them in Hebron
before the LORD; and they anointed David king over Israel, according to
the word of the LORD by Samuel.

<span id="an_11:4">11:4</span> And David and all Israel went to
Jerusalem, which is Jebus; where the Jebusites were, the inhabitants of
the land.

<span id="an_11:5">11:5</span> And the inhabitants of Jebus said to
David, Thou shalt not come hither. Nevertheless David took the castle of
Zion, which is the city of David.

<span id="an_11:6">11:6</span> And David said, Whoever smiteth the
Jebusites first shall be chief and captain. So Joab the son of Zeruiah
went up first, and was chief.

<span id="an_11:7">11:7</span> And David dwelt in the castle; therefore
they called it, The city of David.

<span id="an_11:8">11:8</span> And he built the city around, even from
Millo around: and Joab repaired the rest of the city.

<span id="an_11:9">11:9</span> So David became greater and greater: for
the LORD of hosts was with him.

<span id="an_11:10">11:10</span> These also are the chief of the mighty
men whom David had, who strengthened themselves with him in his kingdom,
and with all Israel, to make him king according to the word of the LORD
concerning Israel.

<span id="an_11:11">11:11</span> And this is the number of the mighty
men whom David had; Jashobeam a Hachmonite, the chief of the captains:
he lifted his spear against three hundred slain by him at one time.

<span id="an_11:12">11:12</span> And after him was Eleazar the son of
Dodo, the Ahohite, who was one of the three mighties.

<span id="an_11:13">11:13</span> He was with David at Pas-dammim, and
there the Philistines were gathered to battle, where was a parcel of
ground full of barley; and the people fled from before the Philistines.

<span id="an_11:14">11:14</span> And they set themselves in the midst of
that parcel, and delivered it, and slew the Philistines; and the LORD
saved them by a great deliverance.

<span id="an_11:15">11:15</span> Now three of the thirty captains went
down to the rock to David, into the cave of Adullam; and the host of the
Philistines encamped in the valley of Rephaim.

<span id="an_11:16">11:16</span> And David was then in the hold, and the
Philistines' garrison was then at Beth-lehem.

<span id="an_11:17">11:17</span> And David longed, and said, Oh that one
would give me drink of the water of the well of Beth-lehem, that is at
the gate!

<span id="an_11:18">11:18</span> And the three broke through the host of
the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Beth-lehem, that was
by the gate, and took it, and brought it to David: but David would not
drink of it, but poured it out to the LORD,

<span id="an_11:19">11:19</span> And said, My God forbid it me, that I
should do this thing: shall I drink the blood of these men that have put
their lives in jeopardy? for with the jeopardy of their lives they
brought it. Therefore he would not drink it. These things did these
three mightiest.

<span id="an_11:20">11:20</span> And Abishai the brother of Joab, he was
chief of the three: for lifting his spear against three hundred, he slew
them, and had a name among the three.

<span id="an_11:21">11:21</span> Of the three, he was more honorable
than the two; for he was their captain: but he attained not to the first
three.

<span id="an_11:22">11:22</span> Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of
a valiant man of Kabzeel, who had done many acts; he slew two lion-like
men of Moab: also he went down and slew a lion in a pit in a snowy day.

<span id="an_11:23">11:23</span> And he slew an Egyptian, a man of great
stature, five cubits high; and in the Egyptian's hand was a spear like a
weaver's beam; and he went down to him with a staff, and plucked the
spear out of the Egyptian's hand, and slew him with his own spear.

<span id="an_11:24">11:24</span> These things did Benaiah the son of
Jehoiada, and had the name among the three mighties.

<span id="an_11:25">11:25</span> Behold, he was honorable among the
thirty, but attained not to the first three: and David set him over his
guard.

<span id="an_11:26">11:26</span> Also the valiant men of the armies
were, Asahel the brother of Joab, Elhanan the son of Dodo of Beth-lehem,

<span id="an_11:27">11:27</span> Shammoth the Harorite, Helez the
Pelonite,

<span id="an_11:28">11:28</span> Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite,
Abiezer the Antothite,

<span id="an_11:29">11:29</span> Sibbecai the Hushathite, Ilai the
Ahohite,

<span id="an_11:30">11:30</span> Maharai the Netophathite, Heled the son
of Baanah the Netophathite,

<span id="an_11:31">11:31</span> Ithai the son of Ribai of Gibeah, that
pertained to the children of Benjamin, Benaiah the Pirathonite,

<span id="an_11:32">11:32</span> Hurai of the brooks of Gaash, Abiel the
Arbathite,

<span id="an_11:33">11:33</span> Azmaveth the Baharumite, Eliahba the
Shaalbonite,

<span id="an_11:34">11:34</span> The sons of Hashem the Gizonite,
Jonathan the son of Shage the Hararite,

<span id="an_11:35">11:35</span> Ahiam the son of Sacar the Hararite,
Eliphel the son of Ur,

<span id="an_11:36">11:36</span> Hepher the Mecherathite, Ahijah the
Pelonite,

<span id="an_11:37">11:37</span> Hezro the Carmelite, Naarai the son of
Ezbai,

<span id="an_11:38">11:38</span> Joel the brother of Nathan, Mibhar the
son of Haggeri,

<span id="an_11:39">11:39</span> Zelek the Ammonite, Naharai the
Berothite, the armor-bearer of Joab the son of Zeruiah,

<span id="an_11:40">11:40</span> Ira the Ithrite, Gareb the Ithrite,

<span id="an_11:41">11:41</span> Uriah the Hittite, Zabad the son of
Ahlai,

<span id="an_11:42">11:42</span> Adina the son of Shiza the Reubenite, a
captain of the Reubenites, and thirty with him,

<span id="an_11:43">11:43</span> Hanan the son of Maachah, and Joshaphat
the Mithnite,

<span id="an_11:44">11:44</span> Uzzia the Ashterathite, Shama and
Jehiel the sons of Hothan the Aroerite,

<span id="an_11:45">11:45</span> Jediael the son of Shimri, and Joha his
brother, the Tizite,

<span id="an_11:46">11:46</span> Eliel the Mehavite, and Jeribai, and
Joshaviah, the sons of Elnaam, and Ithmah the Moabite,

<span id="an_11:47">11:47</span> Eliel, and Obed, and Jasiel the
Mesobaite.

<span id="an_12:1">12:1</span> Now these are they that came to David to
Ziklag, while he yet kept himself close because of Saul the son of Kish:
and they were among the mighty men, helpers of the war.

<span id="an_12:2">12:2</span> They were armed with bows, and could use
both the right hand and the left in hurling stones, and shooting arrows
from a bow, even of Saul's brethren of Benjamin.

<span id="an_12:3">12:3</span> The chief was Ahiezer, then Joash, the
sons of Shemaah the Gibeathite; and Jeziel, and Pelet, the sons of
Azmaveth; and Berachah, and Jehu the Antothite,

<span id="an_12:4">12:4</span> And Ismaiah the Gibeonite, a mighty man
among the thirty, and over the thirty; and Jeremiah, and Jahaziel, and
Johanan, and Josabad the Gederathite,

<span id="an_12:5">12:5</span> Eluzai, and Jerimoth, and Bealiah, and
Shemariah, and Shephatiah the Haruphite,

Joezer, and Jashobeam, the Korhites.

<span id="an_12:7">12:7</span> And Joelah, and Zebadiah, the sons of
Jeroham of Gedor.

<span id="an_12:8">12:8</span> And of the Gadites there separated
themselves to David in the hold in the wilderness men of might, and men
of war fit for the battle, that could handle shield and buckler, whose
faces were like the faces of lions, and were as swift as the roes upon
the mountains;

<span id="an_12:9">12:9</span> Ezer the first, Obadiah the second, Eliab
the third,

<span id="an_12:10">12:10</span> Mishmannah the fourth, Jeremiah the

<span id="an_12:11">12:11</span> Attai the sixth, Eliel the seventh,

<span id="an_12:12">12:12</span> Johanan the eighth, Elzabad the ninth,

<span id="an_12:13">12:13</span> Jeremiah the tenth, Machbanai the
eleventh.

<span id="an_12:14">12:14</span> These were of the sons of Gad, captains
of the host: one of the least was over a hundred, and the greatest over
a thousand.

<span id="an_12:15">12:15</span> These are they that went over Jordan in
the first month, when it had overflowed all its banks; and they put to
flight all them of the valleys, both towards the east, and towards the
west.

<span id="an_12:16">12:16</span> And there came of the children of
Benjamin and Judah to the hold to David.

<span id="an_12:17">12:17</span> And David went out to meet them, and
answered and said to them, If ye have come peaceably to me to help me,
my heart shall be knit to you: but if ye have come to betray me to my
enemies, seeing there is no wrong in my hands, the God of our fathers
look on it, and rebuke it.

<span id="an_12:18">12:18</span> Then the spirit came upon Amasai, who
was chief of the captains, and he said, Thine are we, David, and on thy
side, thou son of Jesse: peace, peace be to thee, and peace be to thy
helpers; for thy God helpeth thee. Then David received them, and made
them captains of the band.

<span id="an_12:19">12:19</span> And there fell some of Manasseh to
David, when he came with the Philistines against Saul to battle: but
they helped them not: for the lords of the Philistines upon advisement
sent him away, saying, He will fall to his master Saul to the jeopardy
of our heads.

<span id="an_12:20">12:20</span> And as he went to Ziklag, there fell to
him of Manasseh, Adnah, and Jozabad, and Jediael, and Michael, and
Jozabad, and Elihu, and Zilthai, captains of the thousands that were of
Manasseh.

<span id="an_12:21">12:21</span> And they helped David against the band
of the rovers: for they were all mighty men of valor, and were captains
in the host.

<span id="an_12:22">12:22</span> For at that time day by day there came
to David to help him, until it was a great host, like the host of God.

<span id="an_12:23">12:23</span> And these are the numbers of the bands
that were ready armed to the war, and came to David to Hebron, to turn
the kingdom of Saul to him, according to the word of the LORD.

<span id="an_12:24">12:24</span> The children of Judah that bore shield
and spear were six thousand and eight hundred, ready armed for war.

<span id="an_12:25">12:25</span> Of the children of Simeon, mighty men
of valor for war, seven thousand and one hundred.

<span id="an_12:26">12:26</span> Of the children of Levi four thousand
and six hundred.

<span id="an_12:27">12:27</span> And Jehoiada was the leader of the
Aaronites, and with him were three thousand and seven hundred;

<span id="an_12:28">12:28</span> And Zadok, a young man mighty of valor,
and of his father's house twenty and two captains.

<span id="an_12:29">12:29</span> And of the children of Benjamin, the
kindred of Saul, three thousand: for hitherto the greatest part of them
had kept the ward of the house of Saul.

<span id="an_12:30">12:30</span> And of the children of Ephraim twenty
thousand and eight hundred, mighty men of valor, famous throughout the
house of their fathers.

<span id="an_12:31">12:31</span> And of the half tribe of Manasseh
eighteen thousand, who were expressed by name, to come and make David
king.

<span id="an_12:32">12:32</span> And of the children of Issachar, who
were men that had understanding of the times, to know what Israel ought
to do; the heads of them were two hundred; and all their brethren were
at their command.

<span id="an_12:33">12:33</span> Of Zebulun, such as went forth to
battle, expert in war, with all instruments of war, fifty thousand, who
could keep rank: they were not of double heart.

<span id="an_12:34">12:34</span> And of Naphtali a thousand captains,
and with them with shield and spear thirty and seven thousand.

<span id="an_12:35">12:35</span> And of the Danites expert in war twenty
and eight thousand and six hundred.

<span id="an_12:36">12:36</span> And of Asher, such as went forth to
battle, expert in war, forty thousand.

<span id="an_12:37">12:37</span> And on the other side of Jordan, of the
Reubenites, and the Gadites, and of the half tribe of Manasseh, with all
manner of instruments of war for the battle, a hundred and twenty
thousand.

<span id="an_12:38">12:38</span> All these men of war, that could keep
rank, came with a perfect heart to Hebron, to make David king over all
Israel: and all the rest also of Israel were of one heart to make David
king.

<span id="an_12:39">12:39</span> And there they were with David three
days, eating and drinking: for their brethren had prepared for them.

<span id="an_12:40">12:40</span> Moreover, they that were nigh them,
even to Issachar, and Zebulun, and Naphtali, brought bread on asses, and
on camels, and on mules, and on oxen, and provision, meal, cakes of
figs, and bunches of raisins, and wine, and oil, and oxen, and sheep
abundantly: for there was joy in Israel.

<span id="an_13:1">13:1</span> And David consulted with the captains of
thousands, and of hundreds, and with every leader.

<span id="an_13:2">13:2</span> And David said to all the congregation of
Israel, If it seemeth good to you, and that it is of the LORD our God,
let us send abroad to our brethren every where, that are left in all the
land of Israel, and with them also to the priests and Levites who are in
their cities and suburbs, that they may assemble to us:

<span id="an_13:3">13:3</span> And let us bring again to us the ark of
our God: for we inquired not at it in the days of Saul.

<span id="an_13:4">13:4</span> And all the congregation said that they
would do so: for the thing was right in the eyes of all the people.

<span id="an_13:5">13:5</span> So David assembled all Israel, from
Shihor of Egypt even to the entrance of Hemath, to bring the ark of God
from Kirjath-jearim.

<span id="an_13:6">13:6</span> And David went up, and all Israel, to
Baalah, that is, to Kirjath-jearim, which belonged to Judah, to bring up
thence the ark of God the LORD, that dwelleth between the cherubim,
whose name is called on it.

<span id="an_13:7">13:7</span> And they carried the ark of God in a new
cart out of the house of Abinadab: and Uzza and Ahio drove the cart.

<span id="an_13:8">13:8</span> And David and all Israel played before
God with all their might, and with singing, and with harps, and with
psalteries, and with timbrels, and with cymbals, and with trumpets.

<span id="an_13:9">13:9</span> And when they came to the threshing-floor
of Chidon, Uzza put forth his hand to hold the ark; for the oxen
stumbled.

<span id="an_13:10">13:10</span> And the anger of the LORD was kindled
against Uzza, and he smote him, because he put his hand to the ark: and
there he died before God.

<span id="an_13:11">13:11</span> And David was displeased, because the
LORD had made a breach upon Uzza: wherefore that place is called
Perez-uzza to this day.

<span id="an_13:12">13:12</span> And David was afraid of God that day,
saying, How shall I bring the ark of God home to me?

<span id="an_13:13">13:13</span> So David brought not the ark to himself
to the city of David, but carried it aside into the house of Obed-edom
the Gittite.

<span id="an_13:14">13:14</span> And the ark of God remained with the
family of Obed-edom in his house three months. And the LORD blessed the
house of Obed-edom, and all that he had.

<span id="an_14:1">14:1</span> Now Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to
David, and timber of cedars, with masons and carpenters, to build him a
house.

<span id="an_14:2">14:2</span> And David perceived that the LORD had
confirmed him king over Israel, for his kingdom was exalted on high,
because of his people Israel.

<span id="an_14:3">14:3</span> And David took more wives at Jerusalem:
and David begat more sons and daughters.

<span id="an_14:4">14:4</span> Now these are the names of his children
which he had in Jerusalem; Shammua, and Shobab, Nathan, and Solomon,

<span id="an_14:5">14:5</span> And Ibhar, and Elishua, and Elpalet,

<span id="an_14:6">14:6</span> And Nogah, and Nepheg, and Japhia,

<span id="an_14:7">14:7</span> And Elishama, and Beeliada, and
Eliphalet.

<span id="an_14:8">14:8</span> And when the Philistines heard that David
was anointed king over all Israel, all the Philistines went up to seek
David. And David heard of it, and went out against them.

<span id="an_14:9">14:9</span> And the Philistines came and spread
themselves in the valley of Rephaim.

<span id="an_14:10">14:10</span> And David inquired of God, saying,
Shall I go up against the Philistines? and wilt thou deliver them into
my hand? And the LORD said to him, Go up; for I will deliver them into
thy hand.

<span id="an_14:11">14:11</span> So they came up to Baal-perazim; and
David smote them there. Then David said, God hath broken in upon my
enemies by my hand like the breaking forth of waters: therefore they
called the name of that place Baal-perazim.

<span id="an_14:12">14:12</span> And when they had left their gods
there, David gave a commandment, and they were burned with fire.

<span id="an_14:13">14:13</span> And the Philistines yet again spread
themselves abroad in the valley.

<span id="an_14:14">14:14</span> Therefore David inquired again of God:
and God said to him, Go not up after them; turn away from them, and come
upon them over against the mulberry trees.

<span id="an_14:15">14:15</span> And it shall be, when thou shalt hear a
sound of going in the tops of the mulberry trees, then thou shalt go out
to battle: for God hath gone forth before thee to smite the host of the
Philistines.

<span id="an_14:16">14:16</span> David therefore did as God commanded
him: and they smote the host of the Philistines from Gibeon even to
Gazer.

<span id="an_14:17">14:17</span> And the fame of David went out into all
lands; and the LORD brought the fear of him upon all nations.

<span id="an_15:1">15:1</span> And David made him houses in the city of
David, and prepared a place for the ark of God, and pitched for it a
tent.

<span id="an_15:2">15:2</span> Then David said, None ought to carry the
ark of God but the Levites: for them hath the LORD chosen to carry the
ark of God, and to minister to him for ever.

<span id="an_15:3">15:3</span> And David assembled all Israel to
Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the LORD to its place, which he had
prepared for it.

<span id="an_15:4">15:4</span> And David assembled the children of
Aaron, and the Levites:

<span id="an_15:5">15:5</span> Of the sons of Kohath; Uriel the chief,
and his brethren a hundred and twenty:

<span id="an_15:6">15:6</span> Of the sons of Merari; Asaiah the chief,
and his brethren two hundred and twenty:

<span id="an_15:7">15:7</span> Of the sons of Gershom; Joel the chief,
and his brethren a hundred and thirty:

<span id="an_15:8">15:8</span> Of the sons of Elizaphan; Shemaiah the
chief, and his brethren two hundred:

<span id="an_15:9">15:9</span> Of the sons of Hebron; Eliel the chief,
and his brethren eighty:

<span id="an_15:10">15:10</span> Of the sons of Uzziel: Amminadab the
chief, and his brethren a hundred and twelve.

<span id="an_15:11">15:11</span> And David called for Zadok and Abiathar
the priests, and for the Levites, for Uriel, Asaiah, and Joel, Shemaiah,
and Eliel, and Amminadab,

<span id="an_15:12">15:12</span> And said to them, Ye are the chief of
the fathers of the Levites: sanctify yourselves, both ye and your
brethren, that ye may bring up the ark of the LORD God of Israel to the
place that I have prepared for it.

<span id="an_15:13">15:13</span> For because ye did it not at the first,
the LORD our God made a breach upon us, for that we sought him not after
the due order.

<span id="an_15:14">15:14</span> So the priests and the Levites
sanctified themselves to bring up the ark of the LORD God of Israel.

<span id="an_15:15">15:15</span> And the children of the Levites bore
the ark of God upon their shoulders with the staffs on it, as Moses
commanded, according to the word of the LORD.

<span id="an_15:16">15:16</span> And David spoke to the chief of the
Levites to appoint their brethren to be the singers with instruments of
music, psalteries, and harps, and cymbals, sounding, by lifting up the
voice with joy.

<span id="an_15:17">15:17</span> So the Levites appointed Heman the son
of Joel; and of his brethren, Asaph the son of Berechiah; and of the
sons of Merari their brethren, Ethan the son of Kushaiah;

<span id="an_15:18">15:18</span> And with them their brethren of the
second degree, Zechariah, Ben, and Jaaziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel,
and Unni, Eliab, and Benaiah, and Maaseiah, and Mattithiah, and
Elipheleh, and Mikneiah, and Obed-edom, and Jeiel, the porters.

<span id="an_15:19">15:19</span> So the singers, Heman, Asaph, and
Ethan, were appointed to sound with cymbals of brass;

<span id="an_15:20">15:20</span> And Zechariah, and Aziel, and
Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, and Eliab, and Maaseiah, and Benaiah,
with psalteries on Alamoth;

<span id="an_15:21">15:21</span> And Mattithiah, and Elipheleh, and
Mikneiah, and Obed-edom, and Jeiel, and Azaziah, with harps on the
Sheminith to excel.

<span id="an_15:22">15:22</span> And Chenaniah, chief of the Levites,
was for song: he instructed about the song, because he was skillful.

<span id="an_15:23">15:23</span> And Berechiah and Elkanah were
door-keepers for the ark.

<span id="an_15:24">15:24</span> And Shebaniah, and Jehoshaphat, and
Nethaneel, and Amasai, and Zechariah, and Benaiah, and Eliezer the
priests, did blow with the trumpets before the ark of God: and Obed-edom
and Jehiah were door-keepers for the ark.

<span id="an_15:25">15:25</span> So David and the elders of Israel, and
the captains over thousands, went to bring up the ark of the covenant of
the LORD from the house of Obed-edom with joy.

<span id="an_15:26">15:26</span> And it came to pass, when God helped
the Levites that bore the ark of the covenant of the LORD, that they
offered seven bullocks and seven rams.

<span id="an_15:27">15:27</span> And David was clothed with a robe of
fine linen, and all the Levites that bore the ark, and the singers, and
Chenaniah the master of the song with the singers: David also had upon
him an ephod of linen.

<span id="an_15:28">15:28</span> Thus all Israel brought up the ark of
the covenant of the LORD with shouting, and with sound of the cornet,
and with trumpets, and with cymbals, making a noise with psalteries and
harps.

<span id="an_15:29">15:29</span> And it came to pass, as the ark of the
covenant of the LORD came to the city of David, that Michal the daughter
of Saul, looking out at a window, saw king David dancing and playing:
and she despised him in her heart.

<span id="an_16:1">16:1</span> So they brought the ark of God, and set
it in the midst of the tent that David had pitched for it: and they
offered burnt-sacrifices and peace-offerings before God.

<span id="an_16:2">16:2</span> And when David had made an end of
offering the burnt-offerings and the peace-offerings, he blessed the
people in the name of the LORD.

<span id="an_16:3">16:3</span> And he dealt to every one of Israel, both
man and woman, to every one a loaf of bread, and a good piece of flesh,
and a flagon of wine.

<span id="an_16:4">16:4</span> And he appointed certain of the Levites
to minister before the ark of the LORD, and to record, and to thank and
praise the LORD God of Israel:

<span id="an_16:5">16:5</span> Asaph the chief, and next to him
Zechariah, Jeiel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Mattithiah, and
Eliab, and Benaiah, and Obed-edom: and Jeiel with psalteries and with
harps; but Asaph made a sound with cymbals;

<span id="an_16:6">16:6</span> Benaiah also and Jahaziel the priests
with trumpets continually before the ark of the covenant of God.

<span id="an_16:7">16:7</span> Then on that day David delivered first
this psalm to thank the LORD into the hand of Asaph and his brethren.

<span id="an_16:8">16:8</span> Give thanks to the LORD, call upon his
name, make known his deeds among the people.

<span id="an_16:9">16:9</span> Sing to him, sing psalms to him, talk ye
of all his wonderous works.

<span id="an_16:10">16:10</span> Glory ye in his holy name: let the
heart of them rejoice that seek the LORD.

<span id="an_16:11">16:11</span> Seek the LORD and his strength, seek
his face continually.

<span id="an_16:12">16:12</span> Remember his wonderful works that he
hath done, his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth;

<span id="an_16:13">16:13</span> O ye seed of Israel his servant, ye
children of Jacob, his chosen ones.

<span id="an_16:14">16:14</span> He is the LORD our God; his judgments
are in all the earth.

<span id="an_16:15">16:15</span> Be ye mindful always of his covenant;
the word which he commanded to a thousand generations;

<span id="an_16:16">16:16</span> Even of the covenant which he made with
Abraham, and of his oath to Isaac;

<span id="an_16:17">16:17</span> And which he confirmed to Jacob for a
law, and to Israel for an everlasting covenant,

<span id="an_16:18">16:18</span> Saying, To thee will I give the land of
Canaan, the lot of your inheritance;

<span id="an_16:19">16:19</span> When ye were but few, even a few, and
strangers in it.

<span id="an_16:20">16:20</span> And when they went from nation to
nation, and from one kingdom to another people;

<span id="an_16:21">16:21</span> He suffered no man to do them wrong:
yea, he reproved kings for their sakes,

<span id="an_16:22">16:22</span> Saying, Touch not my anointed, and do
my prophets no harm.

<span id="an_16:23">16:23</span> Sing to the LORD, all the earth; show
forth from day to day his salvation.

<span id="an_16:24">16:24</span> Declare his glory among the heathen;
his wonderful works among all nations.

<span id="an_16:25">16:25</span> For great is the LORD, and greatly to
be praised: he also is to be feared above all gods.

<span id="an_16:26">16:26</span> For all the gods of the people are
idols: but the LORD made the heavens.

<span id="an_16:27">16:27</span> Glory and honor are in his presence;
strength and gladness are in his place.

<span id="an_16:28">16:28</span> Give to the LORD, ye kindreds of the
people, give to the LORD glory and strength.

<span id="an_16:29">16:29</span> Give to the LORD the glory due to his
name: bring an offering, and come before him: worship the LORD in the
beauty of holiness.

<span id="an_16:30">16:30</span> Fear before him, all the earth: the
world also shall be stable, that it be not moved.

<span id="an_16:31">16:31</span> Let the heavens be glad, and let the
earth rejoice: and let men say among the nations, The LORD reigneth.

<span id="an_16:32">16:32</span> Let the sea roar, and the fullness
thereof: let the fields rejoice, and all that is therein.

<span id="an_16:33">16:33</span> Then shall the trees of the wood sing
at the presence of the LORD, because he cometh to judge the earth.

<span id="an_16:34">16:34</span> O give thanks to the LORD; for he is
good; for his mercy endureth for ever.

<span id="an_16:35">16:35</span> And say ye, Save us, O God of our
salvation, and gather us together, and deliver us from the heathen, that
we may give thanks to thy holy name, and glory in thy praise.

<span id="an_16:36">16:36</span> Blessed be the LORD God of Israel for
ever and ever. And all the people said, Amen, and praised the LORD.

<span id="an_16:37">16:37</span> So he left there before the ark of the
covenant of the LORD Asaph and his brethren, to minister before the ark
continually, as every day's work required:

<span id="an_16:38">16:38</span> And Obed-edom with their brethren,
sixty and eight; Obed-edom also the son of Jeduthun and Hosah to be
porters:

<span id="an_16:39">16:39</span> And Zadok the priest, and his brethren
the priests, before the tabernacle of the LORD in the high place that
was at Gibeon,

<span id="an_16:40">16:40</span> To offer burnt-offerings to the LORD
upon the altar of the burnt-offering continually morning and evening,
and to do according to all that is written in the law of the LORD, which
he commanded Israel;

<span id="an_16:41">16:41</span> And with them Heman and Jeduthun, and
the rest that were chosen, who were expressed by name, to give thanks to
the LORD, because his mercy endureth for ever;

<span id="an_16:42">16:42</span> And with them Heman and Jeduthun with
trumpets and cymbals for those that should make a sound, and with
musical instruments of God. And the sons of Jeduthun were porters.

<span id="an_16:43">16:43</span> And all the people departed every man
to his house: and David returned to bless his house.

<span id="an_17:1">17:1</span> Now it came to pass, as David sat in his
house, that David said to Nathan the prophet, Lo, I dwell in a house of
cedars, but the ark of the covenant of the LORD remaineth under
curtains.

<span id="an_17:2">17:2</span> Then Nathan said to David, Do all that is
in thy heart; for God is with thee.

<span id="an_17:3">17:3</span> And it came to pass the same night, that
the word of God came to Nathan, saying,

<span id="an_17:4">17:4</span> Go and tell David my servant, Thus saith
the LORD, Thou shalt not build me a house to dwell in:

<span id="an_17:5">17:5</span> For I have not dwelt in a house since the
day that I brought up Israel to this day; but have gone from tent to
tent, and from one tabernacle to another.

<span id="an_17:6">17:6</span> Wherever I have walked with all Israel,
have I spoken a word to any of the judges of Israel, whom I commanded to
feed my people, saying, Why have ye not built me a house of cedars?

<span id="an_17:7">17:7</span> Now therefore thus shalt thou say to my
servant David, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, I took thee from the
sheep-cote, even from following the sheep, that thou shouldst be ruler
over my people Israel:

<span id="an_17:8">17:8</span> And I have been with thee whithersoever
thou hast walked, and have cut off all thy enemies from before thee, and
have made thee a name like the name of the great men that are in the
earth.

<span id="an_17:9">17:9</span> Also I will ordain a place for my people
Israel, and will plant them, and they shall dwell in their place, and
shall be moved no more; neither shall the children of wickedness waste
them any more, as at the beginning.

<span id="an_17:10">17:10</span> And since the time that I commanded
judges to be over my people Israel. Moreover, I will subdue all thy
enemies. Furthermore, I tell thee that the LORD will build thee a house.

<span id="an_17:11">17:11</span> And it shall come to pass, when thy
days shall be ended that thou must go to be with thy fathers, that I
will raise up thy seed after thee, who shall be of thy sons; and I will
establish his kingdom.

<span id="an_17:12">17:12</span> He shall build me a house, and I will
establish his throne for ever.

<span id="an_17:13">17:13</span> I will be his father, and he shall be
my son: and I will not take my mercy away from him, as I took it from
him that was before thee:

<span id="an_17:14">17:14</span> But I will settle him in my house and
in my kingdom for ever: and his throne shall be established for
evermore.

<span id="an_17:15">17:15</span> According to all these words, and
according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak to David.

<span id="an_17:16">17:16</span> And David the king came and sat before
the LORD, and said, Who am I, O LORD God, and what is my house, that
thou hast brought me hitherto?

<span id="an_17:17">17:17</span> And yet this was a small thing in thy
eyes, O God; for thou hast also spoken of thy servant's house for a
great while to come, and hast regarded me according to the estate of a
man of high degree, O LORD God.

<span id="an_17:18">17:18</span> What can David speak more to thee for
the honor of thy servant? for thou knowest thy servant.

<span id="an_17:19">17:19</span> O LORD, for thy servant's sake, and
according to thy own heart, hast thou done all this greatness, in making
known all these great things.

<span id="an_17:20">17:20</span> O LORD, there is none like thee,
neither is there any God besides thee, according to all that we have
heard with our ears.

<span id="an_17:21">17:21</span> And what one nation in the earth is
like thy people Israel, whom God went to redeem to be his own people, to
make thee a name of greatness and terribleness, by driving out nations
from before thy people, whom thou hast redeemed out of Egypt?

<span id="an_17:22">17:22</span> For thy people Israel didst thou make
thy own people for ever; and thou, LORD, becamest their God.

<span id="an_17:23">17:23</span> Therefore now, LORD, Let the thing that
thou hast spoken concerning thy servant and concerning his house be
established for ever, and do as thou hast said.

<span id="an_17:24">17:24</span> Let it even be established, that thy
name may be magnified for ever, saying, The LORD of hosts is the God of
Israel, even a God to Israel: and let the house of David thy servant be
established before thee.

<span id="an_17:25">17:25</span> For thou, O my God, hast told thy
servant that thou wilt build him a house: therefore thy servant hath
found in his heart to pray before thee.

<span id="an_17:26">17:26</span> And now, LORD, thou art God, and hast
promised this goodness to thy servant:

<span id="an_17:27">17:27</span> Now therefore let it please thee to
bless the house of thy servant, that it may be before thee for ever: for
thou blessest, O LORD, and it shall be blessed for ever.

<span id="an_18:1">18:1</span> Now after this it came to pass that David
smote the Philistines, and subdued them, and took Gath and its towns out
of the hand of the Philistines.

<span id="an_18:2">18:2</span> And he smote Moab; and the Moabites
became David's servants, and brought gifts.

<span id="an_18:3">18:3</span> And David smote Hadarezer king of Zobah
to Hamath, as he went to establish his dominion by the river Euphrates.

<span id="an_18:4">18:4</span> And David took from him a thousand
chariots, and seven thousand horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen:
David also houghed all the chariot-horses, but reserved of them a
hundred chariots.

<span id="an_18:5">18:5</span> And when the Syrians of Damascus came to
help Hadarezer king of Zobah, David slew of the Syrians two and twenty
thousand men.

<span id="an_18:6">18:6</span> Then David put garrisons in
Syria-damascus; and the Syrians became David's servants, and brought
gifts. Thus the LORD preserved David whithersoever he went.

<span id="an_18:7">18:7</span> And David took the shields of gold that
were on the servants of Hadarezer, and brought them to Jerusalem.

<span id="an_18:8">18:8</span> Likewise from Tibhath, and from Chun,
cities of Hadarezer, David brought very much brass, with which Solomon
made the brazen sea, and the pillars, and the vessels of brass.

<span id="an_18:9">18:9</span> Now when Tou king of Hamath heard how
David had smitten all the host of Hadarezer king of Zobah;

<span id="an_18:10">18:10</span> He sent Hadoram his son to king David
to inquire of his welfare, and to congratulate him, because he had
fought against Hadarezer, and smitten him; (for Hadarezer had warred
with Tou;) and with him all manner of vessels of gold, and silver, and
brass.

<span id="an_18:11">18:11</span> Them also king David dedicated to the
LORD, with the silver and the gold that he brought from all these
nations; from Edom, and from Moab, and from the children of Ammon, and
from the Philistines, and from Amalek.

<span id="an_18:12">18:12</span> Moreover, Abishai the son of Zeruiah
slew of the Edomites in the valley of salt eighteen thousand.

<span id="an_18:13">18:13</span> And he put garrisons in Edom; and all
the Edomites became David's servants. Thus the LORD preserved David
whithersoever he went.

<span id="an_18:14">18:14</span> So David reigned over all Israel, and
executed judgment and justice among all his people.

<span id="an_18:15">18:15</span> And Joab the son of Zeruiah was over
the host; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud, recorder;

<span id="an_18:16">18:16</span> And Zadok the son of Ahitub, and
Abimelech the son of Abiathar, were the priests; and Shavsha was scribe;

<span id="an_18:17">18:17</span> And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was
over the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and the sons of David were
chief about the king.

<span id="an_19:1">19:1</span> Now it came to pass after this, that
Nahash the king of the children of Ammon died, and his son reigned in
his stead.

<span id="an_19:2">19:2</span> And David said, I will show kindness to
Hanun the son of Nahash, because his father showed kindness to me. And
David sent messengers to comfort him concerning his father. So the
servants of David came into the land of the children of Ammon to Hanun,
to comfort him.

<span id="an_19:3">19:3</span> But the princes of the children of Ammon
said to Hanun, Thinkest thou that David doth honor thy father, that he
hath sent comforters to thee? are not his servants come to thee to
search, and to overthrow, and to explore the land?

<span id="an_19:4">19:4</span> Wherefore Hanun took David's servants,
and shaved them, and cut off their garments in the midst hard by their
buttocks, and sent them away.

<span id="an_19:5">19:5</span> Then there went certain, and told David
how the men were served. And he sent to meet them: for the men were
greatly ashamed. And the king said, Tarry at Jericho until your beards
are grown, and then return.

<span id="an_19:6">19:6</span> And when the children of Ammon saw that
they had made themselves odious to David, Hanun and the children of
Ammon sent a thousand talents of silver to hire them chariots and
horsemen out of Mesopotamia, and out of Syria-maachah, and out of Zobah.

<span id="an_19:7">19:7</span> So they hired thirty and two thousand
chariots, and the king of Maachah and his people, who came and encamped
before Medeba. And the children of Ammon assembled from their cities,
and came to battle.

<span id="an_19:8">19:8</span> And when David heard of it, he sent Joab,
and all the host of the mighty men.

<span id="an_19:9">19:9</span> And the children of Ammon came out, and
put the battle in array before the gate of the city: and the kings that
had come were by themselves in the field.

<span id="an_19:10">19:10</span> Now when Joab saw that the battle was
set against him before and behind, he selected all the choice of Israel,
and put them in array against the Syrians.

<span id="an_19:11">19:11</span> And the rest of the people he delivered
to the hand of Abishai his brother, and they set themselves in array
against the children of Ammon.

<span id="an_19:12">19:12</span> And he said, If the Syrians shall be
too strong for me, then thou shalt help me: but if the children of Ammon
shall be too strong for thee, then I will help thee.

<span id="an_19:13">19:13</span> Be of good courage, and let us behave
ourselves valiantly for our people, and for the cities of our God: and
let the LORD do that which is good in his sight.

<span id="an_19:14">19:14</span> So Joab and the people that were with
him drew nigh before the Syrians to the battle; and they fled before
him.

<span id="an_19:15">19:15</span> And when the children of Ammon saw that
the Syrians had fled, they likewise fled before Abishai his brother, and
entered into the city. Then Joab came to Jerusalem.

<span id="an_19:16">19:16</span> And when the Syrians saw that they were
defeated before Israel, they sent messengers, and drew forth the Syrians
that were beyond the river: and Shophach the captain of the host of
Hadarezer went before them.

<span id="an_19:17">19:17</span> And it was told to David; and he
gathered all Israel, and passed over Jordan, and came upon them, and set
the battle in array against them. So when David had put the battle in
array against the Syrians, they fought with him.

<span id="an_19:18">19:18</span> But the Syrians fled before Israel; and
David slew of the Syrians seven thousand men who fought in chariots, and
forty thousand footmen, and killed Shophach the captain of the host.

<span id="an_19:19">19:19</span> And when the servants of Hadarezer saw
that they were defeated before Israel, they made peace with David, and
became his servants: neither would the Syrians help the children of
Ammon any more.

<span id="an_20:1">20:1</span> And it came to pass, that after the year
had expired, at the time that kings go out to battle, Joab led forth the
power of the army, and wasted the country of the children of Ammon, and
came and besieged Rabbah. But David tarried at Jerusalem. And Joab smote
Rabbah, and destroyed it.

<span id="an_20:2">20:2</span> And David took the crown of their king
from his head, and found it to weigh a talent of gold, and there were
precious stones in it; and it was set upon David's head: and he brought
also a great quantity of spoil out of the city.

<span id="an_20:3">20:3</span> And he brought out the people that were
in it, and cut them with saws, and with harrows of iron, and with axes.
Even so David dealt with all the cities of the children of Ammon. And
David and all the people returned to Jerusalem.

<span id="an_20:4">20:4</span> And it came to pass after this, that
there arose war at Gezer with the Philistines: at which time Sibbechai
the Hushathite slew Sippai, that was of the children of the giant: and
they were subdued.

<span id="an_20:5">20:5</span> And there was war again with the
Philistines; and Elhanan the son of Jair slew Lahmi the brother of
Goliath the Gittite, whose spear-staff was like a weaver's beam.

<span id="an_20:6">20:6</span> And yet again there was war at Gath,
where was a man of great stature, whose fingers and toes were four and
twenty, six on each hand, and six on each foot: and he also was the son
of the giant.

<span id="an_20:7">20:7</span> But when he defied Israel, Jonathan the
son of Shimea, David's brother, slew him.

<span id="an_20:8">20:8</span> These were born to the giant in Gath; and
they fell by the hand of David, and by the hand of his servants.

<span id="an_21:1">21:1</span> And Satan stood up against Israel, and
incited David to number Israel.

<span id="an_21:2">21:2</span> And David said to Joab and to the rulers
of the people, Go, number Israel from Beer-sheba even to Dan; and bring
the number of them to me, that I may know it.

<span id="an_21:3">21:3</span> And Joab answered, the LORD make his
people a hundred times more numerous than they are: but, my lord the
king, are they not all my lord's servants? why then doth my lord require
this thing? why will he be a cause of trespass to Israel?

<span id="an_21:4">21:4</span> Nevertheless the king's word prevailed
against Joab. Wherefore Joab departed, and went throughout all Israel,
and came to Jerusalem.

<span id="an_21:5">21:5</span> And Joab gave the sum of the number of
the people to David. And all they of Israel were a thousand thousand and
a hundred thousand men that drew sword: and Judah was four hundred and
seventy thousand men that drew sword.

<span id="an_21:6">21:6</span> But Levi and Benjamin he counted not
among them: for the king's word was abominable to Joab.

<span id="an_21:7">21:7</span> And God was displeased with this thing,
therefore he smote Israel.

<span id="an_21:8">21:8</span> And David said to God, I have sinned
greatly, because I have done this thing: but now, I beseech thee, do
away the iniquity of thy servant; for I have done very foolishly.

<span id="an_21:9">21:9</span> And the LORD spoke to Gad, David's seer,
saying,

<span id="an_21:10">21:10</span> Go and tell David, saying, Thus saith
the LORD, I offer thee three things; choose thee one of them, that I may
do it to thee.

<span id="an_21:11">21:11</span> So Gad came to David, and said to him,
Thus saith the LORD, Choose thee

<span id="an_21:12">21:12</span> Either three years' famine; or three
months to be destroyed before thy foes, while the sword of thy enemies
overtaketh thee; or else three days the sword of the LORD, even the
pestilence, in the land, and the angel of the LORD destroying throughout
all the borders of Israel. Now therefore advise thyself what word I
shall bring again to him that sent me.

<span id="an_21:13">21:13</span> And David said to Gad, I am in a great
strait: let me fall now into the hand of the LORD; for very great are
his mercies: but let me not fall into the hand of man.

<span id="an_21:14">21:14</span> So the LORD sent pestilence upon
Israel: and there fell of Israel seventy thousand men.

<span id="an_21:15">21:15</span> And God sent an angel to Jerusalem to
destroy it: and as he was destroying, the LORD beheld, and he repented
of the evil, and said to the angel that destroyed, It is enough, stay
now thy hand. And the angel of the LORD stood by the threshing-floor of
Ornan the Jebusite.

<span id="an_21:16">21:16</span> And David lifted up his eyes, and saw
the angel of the LORD stand between the earth and the heaven, having a
drawn sword in his hand stretched out over Jerusalem. Then David and the
elders of Israel, who were clothed in sackcloth, fell upon their faces.

<span id="an_21:17">21:17</span> And David said to God, Is it not I that
commanded the people to be numbered? even I it is that have sinned and
done evil indeed; but as for these sheep, what have they done? let thy
hand, I pray thee, O LORD my God, be on me, and on my father's house;
but not on thy people, that they should be afflicted.

<span id="an_21:18">21:18</span> Then the angel of the LORD commanded
Gad to say to David, that David should go up, and erect an altar to the
LORD in the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite.

<span id="an_21:19">21:19</span> And David went up at the saying of Gad,
which he spoke in the name of the LORD.

<span id="an_21:20">21:20</span> And Ornan turned back, and saw the
angel; and his four sons with him hid themselves. Now Ornan was
threshing wheat.

<span id="an_21:21">21:21</span> And as David came to Ornan, Ornan
looked, and saw David, and went out of the threshing-floor, and bowed
himself to David with his face to the ground.

<span id="an_21:22">21:22</span> Then David said to Ornan, Grant me the
place of this threshing-floor, that I may build an altar in it to the
LORD: thou shalt grant it to me for the full price: that the plague may
be stayed from the people.

<span id="an_21:23">21:23</span> And Ornan said to David, Take it to
thee, and let my lord the king do that which is good in his eyes: lo, I
give thee the oxen also for burnt-offerings, and the threshing
instruments for wood, and the wheat for the meat-offering; I give it
all.

<span id="an_21:24">21:24</span> And king David said to Ornan, No; but I
will verily buy it for the full price: for I will not take that which is
thine for the LORD, nor offer burnt-offerings without cost.

<span id="an_21:25">21:25</span> So David gave to Ornan for the place
six hundred shekels of gold by weight.

<span id="an_21:26">21:26</span> And David built there an altar to the
LORD, and offered burnt-offerings and peace-offerings, and called upon
the LORD; and he answered him from heaven by fire upon the altar of
burnt-offering.

<span id="an_21:27">21:27</span> And the LORD commanded the angel; and
he put up his sword again into its sheath.

<span id="an_21:28">21:28</span> At that time when David saw that the
LORD had answered him in the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite, then
he sacrificed there.

<span id="an_21:29">21:29</span> For the tabernacle of the LORD, which
Moses made in the wilderness, and the altar of the burnt-offering, were
at that season in the high place at Gibeon.

<span id="an_21:30">21:30</span> But David could not go before it to
inquire of God: for he was afraid because of the sword of the angel of
the LORD.

<span id="an_22:1">22:1</span> Then David said, This is the house of the
LORD God, and this is the altar of the burnt-offering for Israel.

<span id="an_22:2">22:2</span> And David commanded to assemble the
strangers that were in the land of Israel; and he set masons to hew
wrought stones to build the house of God.

<span id="an_22:3">22:3</span> And David prepared iron in abundance for
the nails for the doors of the gates, and for the joinings; and brass in
abundance without weight;

<span id="an_22:4">22:4</span> Also cedar trees in abundance: for the
Zidonians and they of Tyre brought much cedar wood to David.

<span id="an_22:5">22:5</span> And David said, Solomon my son is young
and tender, and the house that is to be built for the LORD must be very
magnificent, of fame and of glory throughout all countries: I will
therefore now make preparation for it. So David made abundant
preparation before his death.

<span id="an_22:6">22:6</span> Then he called for Solomon his son, and
charged him to build a house for the LORD God of Israel.

<span id="an_22:7">22:7</span> And David said to Solomon, My son, as for
me, it was in my mind to build a house to the name of the LORD my God:

<span id="an_22:8">22:8</span> But the word of the LORD came to me,
saying, Thou hast shed blood abundantly, and hast made great wars: thou
shalt not build a house to my name, because thou hast shed much blood
upon the earth in my sight.

<span id="an_22:9">22:9</span> Behold, a son shall be born to thee, who
shall be a man of rest; and I will give him rest from all his enemies
around: for his name shall be Solomon, and I will give peace and
quietness to Israel in his days.

<span id="an_22:10">22:10</span> He shall build a house for my name; and
he shall be my son, and I will be his father; and I will establish the
throne of his kingdom over Israel for ever.

<span id="an_22:11">22:11</span> Now, my son, the LORD be with thee; and
prosper thou, and build the house of the LORD thy God, as he hath said
of thee.

<span id="an_22:12">22:12</span> Only the LORD give thee wisdom and
understanding, and give thee charge concerning Israel, that thou mayest
keep the law of the LORD thy God.

<span id="an_22:13">22:13</span> Then shalt thou prosper, if thou shalt
take heed to fulfill the statutes and judgments which the LORD charged
Moses with concerning Israel: be strong, and of good courage; dread not,
nor be dismayed.

<span id="an_22:14">22:14</span> Now behold, in my trouble I have
prepared for the house of the LORD a hundred thousand talents of gold,
and a thousand thousand talents of silver; and of brass and iron without
weight; for it is in abundance: timber also and stone have I prepared;
and thou mayest add to them.

<span id="an_22:15">22:15</span> Moreover, there are workmen with thee
in great numbers, hewers and workers of stone and timber, and all manner
of skillful men for every manner of work.

<span id="an_22:16">22:16</span> Of the gold, the silver, and the brass,
and the iron, there is no number. Arise therefore, and be doing, and the
LORD be with thee.

<span id="an_22:17">22:17</span> David also commanded all the princes of
Israel to help Solomon his son, saying,

<span id="an_22:18">22:18</span> Is not the LORD your God with you? and
hath he not given you rest on every side? for he hath given the
inhabitants of the land into my hand; and the land is subdued before the
LORD, and before his people.

<span id="an_22:19">22:19</span> Now set your heart and your soul to
seek the LORD your God; arise, therefore, and build ye the sanctuary of
the LORD God, to bring the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and the holy
vessels of God, into the house that is to be built to the name of the
LORD.

<span id="an_23:1">23:1</span> So when David was old and full of days,
he made Solomon his son king over Israel.

<span id="an_23:2">23:2</span> And he assembled all the princes of
Israel, with the priests and the Levites.

<span id="an_23:3">23:3</span> Now the Levites were numbered from the
age of thirty years and upward: and their number by their polls, man by
man, was thirty and eight thousand.

<span id="an_23:4">23:4</span> Of which, twenty and four thousand were
to oversee the work of the house of the LORD; and six thousand were
officers and judges:

<span id="an_23:5">23:5</span> Moreover, four thousand were porters; and
four thousand praised the LORD with the instruments which I made, said
David, to praise with them.

<span id="an_23:6">23:6</span> And David divided them into courses among
the sons of Levi, namely, Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.

<span id="an_23:7">23:7</span> Of the Gershonites, were, Laadan and
Shimei.

<span id="an_23:8">23:8</span> The sons of Laadan: the chief was Jehiel,
and Zetham, and Joel, three.

<span id="an_23:9">23:9</span> The sons of Shimei; Shelomith, and
Haziel, and Haran, three. These were the chief of the fathers of Laadan.

<span id="an_23:10">23:10</span> And the sons of Shimei were, Jahath,
Zina, and Jeush and Beriah. These four were the sons of Shimei.

<span id="an_23:11">23:11</span> And Jahath was the chief, and Zizah the
second: but Jeush and Beriah had not many sons; therefore they were in
one reckoning, according to their father's house.

<span id="an_23:12">23:12</span> The sons of Kohath; Amram, Izhar,
Hebron, and Uzziel, four.

<span id="an_23:13">23:13</span> The sons of Amram; Aaron and Moses: and
Aaron was separated, that he should sanctify the most holy things, he
and his sons for ever, to burn incense before the LORD, to minister to
him, and to bless in his name for ever.

<span id="an_23:14">23:14</span> Now concerning Moses the man of God,
his sons were named of the tribe of Levi.

<span id="an_23:15">23:15</span> The sons of Moses were, Gershom, and
Eliezer.

<span id="an_23:16">23:16</span> Of the sons of Gershom; Shebuel was the
chief.

<span id="an_23:17">23:17</span> And the sons of Eliezer were, Rehabiah
the chief. And Eliezer had no other sons; but the sons of Rehabiah were
very many.

<span id="an_23:18">23:18</span> Of the sons of Izhar; Shelomith the
chief.

<span id="an_23:19">23:19</span> Of the sons of Hebron; Jeriah the
first, Amariah the second, Jehaziel the third, and Jekameam the fourth.

<span id="an_23:20">23:20</span> Of the sons of Uzziel; Micah the first,
and Jesiah the second.

<span id="an_23:21">23:21</span> The sons of Merari; Mahli, and Mushi.
The sons of Mahli; Eleazar, and Kish.

<span id="an_23:22">23:22</span> And Eleazar died, and had no sons, but
daughters: and their brethren the sons of Kish took them.

<span id="an_23:23">23:23</span> The sons of Mushi; Mahli, and Eder, and
Jeremoth, three.

<span id="an_23:24">23:24</span> These were the sons of Levi after the
house of their fathers; even the chief of the fathers, as they were
counted by number of names by their polls, that did the work for the
service of the house of the LORD, from the age of twenty years and
upward.

<span id="an_23:25">23:25</span> For David said, The LORD God of Israel
hath given rest to his people, that they may dwell in Jerusalem for
ever;

<span id="an_23:26">23:26</span> And also to the Levites: they shall no
more carry the tabernacle, nor any vessels of it for its service.

<span id="an_23:27">23:27</span> For by the last words of David the
Levites were numbered from twenty years old and above:

<span id="an_23:28">23:28</span> Because their office was to wait on the
sons of Aaron for the service of the house of the LORD, in the courts,
and in the chambers, and in the purifying of all holy things, and the
work of the service of the house of God;

<span id="an_23:29">23:29</span> Both for the show-bread, and for the
fine flour for meat-offering, and for the unleavened cakes, and for that
which is baked in the pan, and for that which is fried, and for all
manner of measure and size;

<span id="an_23:30">23:30</span> And to stand every morning to thank and
praise the LORD, and likewise at evening;

<span id="an_23:31">23:31</span> And to offer all burnt-sacrifices to
the LORD on the sabbaths, in the new moons, and on the set feasts, by
number, according to the order commanded to them, continually before the
LORD:

<span id="an_23:32">23:32</span> And that they should keep the charge of
the tabernacle of the congregation, and the charge of the holy place,
and the charge of the sons of Aaron their brethren, in the service of
the house of the LORD.

<span id="an_24:1">24:1</span> Now these are the divisions of the sons
of Aaron. The sons of Aaron; Nadab, and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.

<span id="an_24:2">24:2</span> But Nadab and Abihu died before their
father, and had no children: therefore Eleazar and Ithamar executed the
priests' office.

<span id="an_24:3">24:3</span> And David distributed them, both Zadok of
the sons of Eleazar, and Ahimelech of the sons of Ithamar, according to
their offices in their service.

<span id="an_24:4">24:4</span> And there were more chief men found of
the sons of Eleazar than of the sons of Ithamar; and thus were they
divided. Among the sons of Eleazar there were sixteen chief men of the
house of their fathers, and eight among the sons of Ithamar according to
the house of their fathers.

<span id="an_24:5">24:5</span> Thus were they divided by lot, one sort
with another; for the governors of the sanctuary, and governors of the
house of God, were of the sons of Eleazar, and of the sons of Ithamar.

<span id="an_24:6">24:6</span> And Shemaiah the son of Nethaneel the
scribe, one of the Levites, wrote them before the king, and the princes,
and Zadok the priest, and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, and before the
chief of the fathers of the priests and Levites: one principal household
being taken for Eleazar, and one taken for Ithamar.

<span id="an_24:7">24:7</span> Now the first lot came forth to
Jehoiarib, the second to Jedaiah,

<span id="an_24:8">24:8</span> The third to Harim, the fourth to Seorim,

<span id="an_24:9">24:9</span> The fifth to Malchijah, the sixth to
Mijamin,

<span id="an_24:10">24:10</span> The seventh to Hakkoz, the eighth to
Abijah,

<span id="an_24:11">24:11</span> The ninth to Jeshuah, the tenth to
Shecaniah,

<span id="an_24:12">24:12</span> The eleventh to Eliashib, the twelfth
to Jakim,

<span id="an_24:13">24:13</span> The thirteenth to Huppah, the
fourteenth to Jeshebeab,

<span id="an_24:14">24:14</span> The fifteenth to Bilgah, the sixteenth
to Immer,

<span id="an_24:15">24:15</span> The seventeenth to Hezer, the
eighteenth to Aphses,

<span id="an_24:16">24:16</span> The nineteenth to Pethahiah, the
twentieth to Jehezekel,

<span id="an_24:17">24:17</span> The one and twentieth to Jachin, the
two and twentieth to Gamul,

<span id="an_24:18">24:18</span> The three and twentieth to Delaiah, the
four and twentieth to Maaziah.

<span id="an_24:19">24:19</span> These were the orderings of them in
their service to come into the house of the LORD, according to their
manner, under Aaron their father, as the LORD God of Israel had
commanded him.

<span id="an_24:20">24:20</span> And the rest of the sons of Levi were
these: Of the sons of Amram; Shubael: of the sons of Shubael; Jehdeiah.

<span id="an_24:21">24:21</span> Concerning Rehabiah: of the sons of
Rehabiah, the first was Isshiah.

<span id="an_24:22">24:22</span> Of the Izharites; Shelomoth: of the
sons of Shelomoth; Jahath.

<span id="an_24:23">24:23</span> And the sons of Hebron; Jeriah the
first, Amariah the second, Jehaziel the third, Jekameam the fourth.

<span id="an_24:24">24:24</span> Of the sons of Uzziel; Michah: of the
sons of Michah; Shamir.

<span id="an_24:25">24:25</span> The brother of Michah was Isshiah: of
the sons of Isshiah; Zechariah.

<span id="an_24:26">24:26</span> The sons of Merari were Mahli, and
Mushi: the sons of Jaaziah; Beno.

<span id="an_24:27">24:27</span> The sons of Merari by Jaaziah; Beno,
and Shoham, and Zaccur, and Ibri.

<span id="an_24:28">24:28</span> Of Mahli came Eleazar, who had no sons.

<span id="an_24:29">24:29</span> Concerning Kish: the son of Kish was
Jerahmeel.

<span id="an_24:30">24:30</span> The sons also of Mushi; Mahli, and
Eder, and Jerimoth. These were the sons of the Levites after the house
of their fathers.

<span id="an_24:31">24:31</span> These likewise cast lots over against
their brethren the sons of Aaron in the presence of David the king, and
Zadok, and Ahimelech, and the chief of the fathers of the priests and
Levites, even the principal fathers over against their younger brethren.

<span id="an_25:1">25:1</span> Moreover David and the captains of the
host separated to the service of the sons of Asaph, and of Heman, and of
Jeduthun, who should prophesy with harps, with psalteries, and with
cymbals: and the number of the workmen according to their service was:

<span id="an_25:2">25:2</span> Of the sons of Asaph; Zaccur, and Joseph,
and Nethaniah, and Asarelah, the sons of Asaph under the hands of Asaph,
who prophesied according to the order of the king.

<span id="an_25:3">25:3</span> Of Jeduthun: the sons of Jeduthun;
Gedaliah, and Zeri, and Jeshaiah, Hashabiah, and Mattithiah, six, under
the hands of their father Jeduthun, who prophesied with a harp, to give
thanks and to praise the LORD.

<span id="an_25:4">25:4</span> Of Heman: the sons of Heman; Bukkiah,
Mattaniah, Uzziel, Shebuel, and Jerimoth, Hananiah, Hanani, Eliathah,
Giddalti, and Romamti-ezer, Joshbekashah, Mallothi, Hothir, and
Mahazioth:

<span id="an_25:5">25:5</span> All these were the sons of Heman the
king's seer in the words of God, to lift up the horn. And God gave to
Heman fourteen sons and three daughters.

<span id="an_25:6">25:6</span> All these were under the hands of their
father for song in the house of the LORD, with cymbals, psalteries, and
harps, for the service of the house of God, according to the king's
order to Asaph, Jeduthun, and Heman.

<span id="an_25:7">25:7</span> So the number of them, with their
brethren that were instructed in the songs of the LORD, even all that
were skillful, was two hundred and eighty eight.

<span id="an_25:8">25:8</span> And they cast lots, ward against ward, as
well the small as the great, the teacher as the scholar.

<span id="an_25:9">25:9</span> Now the first lot came forth for Asaph to
Joseph: the second to Gedaliah, who with his brethren and sons were
twelve:

<span id="an_25:10">25:10</span> The third to Zaccur, he, his sons, and
his brethren, were twelve:

<span id="an_25:11">25:11</span> The fourth to Izri, he, his sons, and
his brethren, were twelve:

sons, and his brethren, were twelve:

and his brethren, were twelve:

<span id="an_25:17">25:17</span> The tenth to Shimei, he, his sons, and
his brethren, were twelve:

<span id="an_25:18">25:18</span> The eleventh to Azareel, he, his sons,
and his brethren, were twelve:

and his brethren, were twelve:

sons, and his brethren, were twelve:

<span id="an_25:21">25:21</span> The fourteenth to Mattithiah, he, his
sons, and his brethren, were twelve:

<span id="an_25:22">25:22</span> The fifteenth to Jeremoth, he, his
sons, and his brethren, were twelve:

<span id="an_25:23">25:23</span> The sixteenth to Hananiah, he, his
sons, and his brethren, were twelve:

<span id="an_25:24">25:24</span> The seventeenth to Joshbekashah, he,
his sons, and his brethren, were twelve:

<span id="an_25:25">25:25</span> The eighteenth to Hanani, he, his sons,
and his brethren, were twelve:

<span id="an_25:26">25:26</span> The nineteenth to Mallothi, he, his
sons, and his brethren, were twelve:

<span id="an_25:27">25:27</span> The twentieth to Eliathah, he, his
sons, and his brethren, were twelve:

<span id="an_25:28">25:28</span> The one and twentieth to Hothir, he,
his sons, and his brethren, were twelve:

<span id="an_25:29">25:29</span> The two and twentieth to Giddalti, he,
his sons, and his brethren, were twelve:

<span id="an_25:30">25:30</span> The three and twentieth to Mahazioth,
he, his sons, and his brethren, were twelve:

<span id="an_25:31">25:31</span> The four and twentieth to Romamti-ezer,
he, his sons, and his brethren, were twelve.

<span id="an_26:1">26:1</span> Concerning the divisions of the porters:
Of the Korhites was Meshelemiah the son of Kore, of the sons of Asaph.

<span id="an_26:2">26:2</span> And the sons of Meshelemiah were,
Zechariah the first-born, Jediael the second, Zebadiah the third,
Jathniel the fourth,

<span id="an_26:3">26:3</span> Elam the fifth, Jehohanan the sixth,
Elioenai the seventh.

<span id="an_26:4">26:4</span> Moreover the sons of Obed-edom were,
Shemaiah the first-born, Jehozabad the second, Joah the third, and Sacar
the fourth, and Nethaneel the fifth,

<span id="an_26:5">26:5</span> Ammiel the sixth, Issachar the seventh,
Peulthai the eighth: for God blessed him.

<span id="an_26:6">26:6</span> Also to Shemaiah his son were sons born,
that ruled throughout the house of their father: for they were mighty
men of valor.

<span id="an_26:7">26:7</span> The sons of Shemaiah; Othni, and Rephael,
and Obed, Elzabad, whose brethren were strong men, Elihu, and Semachiah.

<span id="an_26:8">26:8</span> All these of the sons of Obed-edom: they
and their sons and their brethren, able men for strength for the
service, were sixty and two of Obed-edom.

<span id="an_26:9">26:9</span> And Meshelemiah had sons and brethren,
strong men, eighteen.

<span id="an_26:10">26:10</span> Also Hosah of the children of Merari,
had sons; Simri the chief, (for though he was not the first-born, yet
his father made him the chief;)

<span id="an_26:11">26:11</span> Hilkiah the second, Tebaliah the third,
Zechariah the fourth: all the sons and brethren of Hosah were thirteen.

<span id="an_26:12">26:12</span> Among these were the divisions of the
porters, even among the chief men, having wards one against another, to
minister in the house of the LORD.

<span id="an_26:13">26:13</span> And they cast lots, as well the small
as the great, according to the house of their fathers, for every gate.

<span id="an_26:14">26:14</span> And the lot eastward fell to Shelemiah.
Then for Zechariah his son, a wise counselor, they cast lots; and his
lot came out northward.

<span id="an_26:15">26:15</span> To obed-edom southward; and to his sons
the house of Asuppim.

<span id="an_26:16">26:16</span> To Shuppim and Hosah the lot came forth
westward, with the gate Shallecheth, by the way of the ascent, ward
against ward.

<span id="an_26:17">26:17</span> Eastward were six Levites, northward
four a day, southward four a day, and towards Asuppim, two and two.

<span id="an_26:18">26:18</span> At Parbar westward, four at the causey,
and two at Parbar.

<span id="an_26:19">26:19</span> These are the divisions of the porters
among the sons of Kore, and among the sons of Merari.

<span id="an_26:20">26:20</span> And of the Levites, Ahijah was over the
treasures of the house of God, and over the treasures of the dedicated
things.

<span id="an_26:21">26:21</span> As concerning the sons of Laadan; the
sons of the Gershonite Laadan, chief fathers, even of Laadan the
Gershonite, were Jehieli.

<span id="an_26:22">26:22</span> The sons of Jehieli; Zetham, and Joel
his brother, who were over the treasures of the house of the LORD.

<span id="an_26:23">26:23</span> Of the Amramites, and the Izharites,
the Hebronites, and the Uzzielites:

<span id="an_26:24">26:24</span> And Shebuel the son of Gershom, the son
of Moses, was ruler of the treasures.

<span id="an_26:25">26:25</span> And his brethren by Eliezer; Rehabiah
his son, and Jeshaiah his son, and Joram his son, and Zichri his son,
and Shelomith his son.

<span id="an_26:26">26:26</span> Which Shelomith and his brethren were
over all the treasures of the dedicated things, which David the king,
and the chief fathers, the captains over thousands and hundreds, and the
captains of the host, had dedicated.

<span id="an_26:27">26:27</span> Out of the spoils won in battles did
they dedicate to maintain the house of the LORD.

<span id="an_26:28">26:28</span> And all that Samuel the seer, and Saul
the son of Kish, and Abner the son of Ner, and Joab the son of Zeruiah,
had dedicated; and whoever had dedicated any thing, it was under the
hand of Shelomith, and of his brethren.

<span id="an_26:29">26:29</span> Of the Izharites, Chenaniah and his
sons were for the outward business over Israel, for officers and judges.

<span id="an_26:30">26:30</span> And of the Hebronites, Hashabiah and
his brethren, men of valor, a thousand and seven hundred, were officers
among them of Israel on this side of Jordan westward in all the business
of the LORD, and in the service of the king.

<span id="an_26:31">26:31</span> Among the Hebronites was Jerijah the
chief, even among the Hebronites, according to the generations of his
fathers. In the fortieth year of the reign of David they were sought
for, and there were found among them mighty men of valor at Jazer of
Gilead.

<span id="an_26:32">26:32</span> And his brethren, men of valor, were
two thousand and seven hundred chief fathers, whom king David made
rulers over the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh,
for every matter pertaining to God, and affairs of the king.

<span id="an_27:1">27:1</span> Now the children of Israel after their
number, to wit, the chief fathers, and captains of thousands and
hundreds, and their officers that served the king in any matter of the
courses, which came in and went out month by month throughout all the
months of the year, of every course were twenty and four thousand.

<span id="an_27:2">27:2</span> Over the first course for the first month
was Jashobeam the son of Zabdiel: and in his course were twenty and four
thousand.

<span id="an_27:3">27:3</span> Of the children of Perez, was the chief
of all the captains of the host for the first month.

<span id="an_27:4">27:4</span> And over the course of the second month
was Dodai an Ahohite, and of his course was Mikloth also the ruler: in
his course likewise were twenty and four thousand.

<span id="an_27:5">27:5</span> The third captain of the host for the
third month was Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, a chief priest: and in his
course were twenty and four thousand.

<span id="an_27:6">27:6</span> This is that Benaiah, who was mighty
among the thirty, and above the thirty: and in his course was Ammizabad
his son.

<span id="an_27:7">27:7</span> The fourth captain for the fourth month
was Asahel the brother of Joab, and Zebadiah his son after him: and in
his course were twenty and four thousand.

<span id="an_27:8">27:8</span> The fifth captain for the fifth month was
Shamhuth the Izrahite: and in his course were twenty and four thousand.

<span id="an_27:9">27:9</span> The sixth captain for the sixth month was
Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite: and in his course were twenty and
four thousand.

<span id="an_27:10">27:10</span> The seventh captain for the seventh
month was Helez the Pelonite, of the children of Ephraim: and in his
course were twenty and four thousand.

<span id="an_27:11">27:11</span> The eighth captain for the eighth month
was Sibbecai the Hushathite, of the Zarhites: and in his course were
twenty and four thousand.

<span id="an_27:12">27:12</span> The ninth captain for the ninth month
was Abiezer the Anetothite, of the Benjaminites: and in his course were
twenty and four thousand.

<span id="an_27:13">27:13</span> The tenth captain for the tenth month
was Maharai the Netophathite, of the Zarhites: and in his course were
twenty and four thousand.

<span id="an_27:14">27:14</span> The eleventh captain for the eleventh
month was Benaiah the Pirathonite, of the children of Ephraim: and in
his course were twenty and four thousand.

<span id="an_27:15">27:15</span> The twelfth captain for the twelfth
month was Heldai the Netophathite, of Othniel: and in his course were
twenty and four thousand.

<span id="an_27:16">27:16</span> Furthermore over the tribes of Israel:
the ruler of the Reubenites was Eliezer the son of Zichri: of the
Simeonites, Shephatiah the son of Maachah:

<span id="an_27:17">27:17</span> Of the Levites, Hashabiah the son of
Kemuel: of the Aaronites, Zadok:

<span id="an_27:18">27:18</span> Of Judah, Elihu, one of the brethren of
David: of Issachar, Omri the son of Michael:

<span id="an_27:19">27:19</span> Of Zebulun, Ishmaiah the son of
Obadiah: of Naphtali, Jerimoth the son of Azriel:

<span id="an_27:20">27:20</span> Of the children of Ephraim, Hoshea the
son of Azaziah: of the half tribe of Manasseh, Joel the son of Pedaiah:

<span id="an_27:21">27:21</span> Of the half tribe of Manasseh in
Gilead, Iddo the son of Zechariah: of Benjamin, Jaasiel the son of
Abner:

<span id="an_27:22">27:22</span> Of Dan, Azareel the son of Jeroham.
These were the princes of the tribes of Israel.

<span id="an_27:23">27:23</span> But David took not the number of them
from twenty years old and under: because the LORD had said he would
increase Israel like to the stars of the heavens.

<span id="an_27:24">27:24</span> Joab the son of Zeruiah began to
number, but he finished not, because there fell wrath for it against
Israel; neither was the number put in the account of the chronicles of
king David.

<span id="an_27:25">27:25</span> And over the king's treasures was
Azmaveth the son of Adiel: and over the store-houses in the fields, in
the cities, and in the villages, and in the castles, was Jehonathan the
son of Uzziah:

<span id="an_27:26">27:26</span> And over them that did the work of the
field for tillage of the ground was Ezri the son of Chelub:

<span id="an_27:27">27:27</span> And over the vineyards was Shimei the
Ramathite: over the increase of the vineyards for the wine cellars was
Zabdi the Shiphmite:

<span id="an_27:28">27:28</span> And over the olive trees and the
sycamore trees that were in the low plains was Baal-hanan the Gederite:
and over the cellars of oil was Joash:

<span id="an_27:29">27:29</span> And over the herds that fed in Sharon
was Shitrai the Sharonite: and over the herds that were in the valleys
was Shaphat the son of Adlai:

<span id="an_27:30">27:30</span> Over the camels also was Obil the
Ishmaelite: and over the asses was Jehdeiah the Meronothite:

<span id="an_27:31">27:31</span> And over the flocks was Jaziz the
Hagerite. All these were the rulers of the substance which was king
David's.

<span id="an_27:32">27:32</span> Also Jonathan, David's uncle, was a
counselor, a wise man, and a scribe: and Jehiel the son of Hachmoni was
with the king's sons:

<span id="an_27:33">27:33</span> And Ahithophel was the king's
counselor: and Hushai the Archite was the king's companion:

<span id="an_27:34">27:34</span> And after Ahithophel was Jehoiada the
son of Benaiah, and Abiathar: and the general of the king's army was
Joab.

<span id="an_28:1">28:1</span> And David assembled all the princes of
Israel, the princes of the tribes, and the captains of the companies
that ministered to the king by course, and the captains over the
thousands, and captains over the hundreds, and the stewards over all the
substance and possession of the king, and of his sons, with the
officers, and with the mighty men, and with all the valiant men to
Jerusalem.

<span id="an_28:2">28:2</span> Then David the king stood upon his feet,
and said, Hear me, my brethren, and my people: As for me, I had in my
heart to build a house of rest for the ark of the covenant of the LORD,
and for the footstool of our God, and had made ready for the building:

<span id="an_28:3">28:3</span> But God said to me, Thou shalt not build
a house for my name, because thou hast been a man of war, and hast shed
blood.

<span id="an_28:4">28:4</span> However the LORD God of Israel chose me
before all the house of my father to be king over Israel for ever: for
he hath chosen Judah to be the ruler; and of the house of Judah, the
house of my father; and among the sons of my father he approved me to
make me king over all Israel:

<span id="an_28:5">28:5</span> And of all my sons, (for the LORD hath
given me many sons,) he hath chosen Solomon my son to sit upon the
throne of the kingdom of the LORD over Israel.

<span id="an_28:6">28:6</span> And he said to me, Solomon thy son, he
shall build my house and my courts: for I have chosen him to be my son,
and I will be his father.

<span id="an_28:7">28:7</span> Moreover I will establish his kingdom for
ever, if he shall be constant to do my commandments and my judgments, as
at this day.

<span id="an_28:8">28:8</span> Now therefore in the sight of all Israel
the congregation of the LORD, and in the audience of our God, keep and
seek for all the commandments of the LORD your God: that ye may possess
this good land, and leave it for an inheritance for your children after
you for ever.

<span id="an_28:9">28:9</span> And thou, Solomon my son, know thou the
God of thy father, and serve him with a perfect heart, and with a
willing mind: for the LORD searcheth all hearts and understandeth all
the imaginations of the thoughts: if thou shalt seek him, he will be
found of thee; but if thou shalt forsake him, he will cast thee off for
ever.

<span id="an_28:10">28:10</span> Take heed now; for the LORD hath chosen
thee to build a house for the sanctuary: be strong, and do it.

<span id="an_28:11">28:11</span> Then David gave to Solomon his son the
pattern of the porch, and of the houses of it, and of its treasuries,
and of its upper chambers, and of its inner parlors, and of the place of
the mercy-seat,

<span id="an_28:12">28:12</span> And the pattern of all that he had by
the spirit, of the courts of the house of the LORD, and of all the
chambers around, of the treasuries of the house of God, and of the
treasuries of the dedicated things:

<span id="an_28:13">28:13</span> Also for the courses of the priests and
the Levites, and for all the work of the service of the house of the
LORD, and for all the vessels of service in the house of the LORD.

<span id="an_28:14">28:14</span> He gave of gold by weight for things of
gold, for all instruments of all manner of service; silver also for all
instruments of silver by weight, for all instruments of every kind of
service:

<span id="an_28:15">28:15</span> Even the weight for the candlesticks of
gold, and for their lamps of gold, by weight for every candlestick, and
for its lamps: and for the candlesticks of silver by weight, both for
the candlestick, and also for its lamps, according to the use of every
candlestick.

<span id="an_28:16">28:16</span> And by weight he gave gold for the
tables of show-bread, for every table; and likewise silver for the
tables of silver:

<span id="an_28:17">28:17</span> Also pure gold for the flesh-hooks, and
the bowls, and the cups: and for the golden basins he gave gold by
weight for every basin; and likewise silver by weight for every basin of
silver:

<span id="an_28:18">28:18</span> And for the altar of incense refined
gold by weight; and gold for the pattern of the chariot of the cherubim,
that spread out their wings, and covered the ark of the covenant of the
LORD.

<span id="an_28:19">28:19</span> All this, said David, the LORD made me
understand in writing by his hand upon me, even all the works of this
pattern.

<span id="an_28:20">28:20</span> And David said to Solomon his son, Be
strong, and of good courage, and do it: fear not, nor be dismayed, for
the LORD God, even my God, will be with thee; he will not fail thee, nor
forsake thee, until thou hast finished all the work for the service of
the house of the LORD.

<span id="an_28:21">28:21</span> And behold, the courses of the priests
and the Levites, even they shall be with thee for all the service of the
house of God: and there shall be with thee for all manner of workmanship
every willing skillful man, for any manner of service: also the princes
and all the people will be wholly at thy command.

<span id="an_29:1">29:1</span> Furthermore David the king said to all
the congregation, Solomon my son, whom alone God hath chosen, is yet
young and tender, and the work is great: for the palace is not for man,
but for the LORD God.

<span id="an_29:2">29:2</span> Now I have prepared with all my might for
the house of my God the gold for things to he made of gold, and the
silver for things of silver, and the brass for things of brass, the iron
for things of iron, and wood for things of wood; onyx-stones, and stones
to be set, glittering stones, and of divers colors, and all manner of
precious stones, and marble stones in abundance.

<span id="an_29:3">29:3</span> Moreover, because I have set my affection
to the house of my God, I have of my own possessions, of gold and
silver, which I have given to the house of my God, over and above all
that I have prepared for the holy house,

<span id="an_29:4">29:4</span> Even three thousand talents of gold, of
the gold of Ophir, and seven thousand talents of refined silver, to
overlay the walls of the houses:

<span id="an_29:5">29:5</span> The gold for things of gold, and the
silver for things of silver, and for all manner of work to be made by
the hands of artificers. And who then is willing to consecrate his
service this day to the LORD?

<span id="an_29:6">29:6</span> Then the chief of the fathers and princes
of the tribes of Israel, and the captains of thousands and of hundreds,
with the rulers over the king's work, offered willingly,

<span id="an_29:7">29:7</span> And gave for the service of the house of
God of gold five thousand talents and ten thousand drams, and of silver
ten thousand talents, and of brass eighteen thousand talents, and one
hundred thousand talents of iron.

<span id="an_29:8">29:8</span> And they with whom precious stones were
found gave them to the treasure of the house of the LORD, by the hand of
Jehiel the Gershonite.

<span id="an_29:9">29:9</span> Then the people rejoiced, for that they
offered willingly, because with perfect heart they offered willingly to
the LORD: and David the king also rejoiced with great joy.

<span id="an_29:10">29:10</span> Wherefore David blessed the LORD before
all the congregation: and David said, Blessed be thou, LORD God of
Israel our father, for ever and ever.

<span id="an_29:11">29:11</span> Thine, O LORD, is the greatness, and
the power, and the glory, and the victory, and the majesty: for all that
is in the heaven and on the earth is thine; thine is the kingdom, O
LORD, and thou art exalted as head above all.

<span id="an_29:12">29:12</span> Both riches and honor come from thee,
and thou reignest over all; and in thy hand is power and might; and in
thy hand it is to make great, and to give strength to all.

<span id="an_29:13">29:13</span> Now therefore, our God, we thank thee,
and praise thy glorious name.

<span id="an_29:14">29:14</span> But who am I, and what is my people,
that we should be able to offer so willingly after this sort? for all
things come from thee, and of thy own have we given thee.

<span id="an_29:15">29:15</span> For we are strangers before thee, and
sojourners, as were all our fathers: our days on the earth are as a
shadow, and there is no abiding.

<span id="an_29:16">29:16</span> O LORD our God, all this store that we
have prepared to build thee a house for thy holy name cometh from thy
hand, and is all thy own.

<span id="an_29:17">29:17</span> I know also, my God, that thou triest
the heart, and hast pleasure in uprightness. As for me, in the
uprightness of my heart I have willingly offered all these things: and
now have I seen with joy thy people, who are present here, to offer
willingly to thee.

<span id="an_29:18">29:18</span> O LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and of
Israel, our fathers, keep this for ever in the imagination of the
thoughts of the heart of thy people, and prepare their heart to thee:

<span id="an_29:19">29:19</span> And give to Solomon my son a perfect
heart, to keep thy commandments, thy testimonies, and thy statutes, and
to do all these things, and to build the palace, for which I have made
provision.

<span id="an_29:20">29:20</span> And David said to all the congregation,
Now bless the LORD your God. And all the congregation blessed the LORD
God of their fathers, and bowed their heads, and worshiped the LORD, and
the king.

<span id="an_29:21">29:21</span> And they sacrificed sacrifices to the
LORD, and offered burnt-offerings to the LORD, on the morrow after that
day, even a thousand bullocks, a thousand rams, and a thousand lambs,
with their drink-offerings, and sacrifices in abundance for all Israel:

<span id="an_29:22">29:22</span> And ate and drank before the LORD on
that day with great gladness. And they made Solomon the son of David
king the second time, and anointed him to the LORD to be the chief
governor, and Zadok to be priest.

<span id="an_29:23">29:23</span> Then Solomon sat on the throne of the
LORD as king instead of David his father, and prospered; and all Israel
obeyed him.

<span id="an_29:24">29:24</span> And all the princes, and the mighty
men, and all the sons likewise of king David, submitted themselves to
Solomon the king.

<span id="an_29:25">29:25</span> And the LORD magnified Solomon
exceedingly in the sight of all Israel, and bestowed upon him such royal
majesty as had not been on any king before him in Israel.

<span id="an_29:26">29:26</span> Thus David the son of Jesse reigned
over all Israel.

<span id="an_29:27">29:27</span> And the time that he reigned over
Israel was forty years; seven years he reigned in Hebron, and thirty and
three years he reigned in Jerusalem.

<span id="an_29:28">29:28</span> And he died in a good old age, full of
days, riches, and honor: and Solomon his son reigned in his stead.

<span id="an_29:29">29:29</span> Now the acts of David the king, first
and last, behold, they are written in the book of Samuel the seer, and
in the book of Nathan the prophet, and in the book of Gad the seer,

<span id="an_29:30">29:30</span> With all his reign and his might, and
the times that went over him, and over Israel, and over all the kingdoms
of the countries.
