### Webster's Bible: Ruth

<span id="an_1:1">1:1</span> Now it came to pass in the days when the
judges ruled, that there was a famine in the land. And a certain man of
Beth-lehem-judah went to dwell in the country of Moab, he, and his wife,
and his two sons.

<span id="an_1:2">1:2</span> And the name of the man was Elimelech, and
the name of his wife Naomi, and the name of his two sons Mahlon and
Chilion, Ephrathites of Beth-lehem-judah. And they came into the country
of Moab, and continued there.

<span id="an_1:3">1:3</span> And Elimelech Naomi's husband died; and she
was left, and her two sons.

<span id="an_1:4">1:4</span> And they took to themselves wives of the
women of Moab; the name of the one was Orpah, and the name of the other
Ruth: and they dwelt there about ten years.

<span id="an_1:5">1:5</span> And Mahlon and Chilion died also both of
them; and the woman was left by her two sons and her husband.

<span id="an_1:6">1:6</span> Then she arose with her daughters-in-law,
that she might return from the country of Moab: for she had heard in the
country of Moab how that the LORD had visited his people in giving them
bread.

<span id="an_1:7">1:7</span> Wherefore she went forth from the place
where she was, and her two daughters-in-law with her; and they went on
the way to return to the land of Judah.

<span id="an_1:8">1:8</span> And Naomi said to her two daughters-in-law,
Go, return each to her mother's house: the LORD deal kindly with you, as
ye have dealt with the dead, and with me.

<span id="an_1:9">1:9</span> The LORD grant you that ye may find rest,
each of you in the house of her husband. Then she kissed them; and they
lifted up their voice, and wept.

<span id="an_1:10">1:10</span> And they said to her, surely we will
return with thee to thy people.

<span id="an_1:11">1:11</span> And Naomi said, Turn again, my daughters:
why will ye go with me? shall I bear more sons, that they may be your
husbands?

<span id="an_1:12">1:12</span> Turn again, my daughters, go your way;
for I am too old to have a husband. If I should say, I have hope, if I
should have a husband also to-night, and should also bear sons;

<span id="an_1:13">1:13</span> Would ye wait for them till they should
be grown? would ye stay for them from having husbands? nay, my
daughters; for it grieveth me much for your sakes, that the hand of the
LORD has gone out against me.

<span id="an_1:14">1:14</span> And they lifted up their voice, and wept
again. And Orpah kissed her mother-in-law; but Ruth cleaved to her.

<span id="an_1:15">1:15</span> And she said, Behold, thy sister-in-law
hath gone back to her people, and to her gods: return thou after thy
sister-in-law.

<span id="an_1:16">1:16</span> And Ruth said, Entreat me not to leave
thee, or to return from following thee: for whither thou goest, I will
go; and where thou lodgest, I will lodge: thy people shall be my people,
and thy God my God:

<span id="an_1:17">1:17</span> Where thou diest, will I die, and there
will I be buried: the LORD do so to me, and more also, if aught but
death shall part thee and me.

<span id="an_1:18">1:18</span> When she saw that she was steadfastly
resolved to go with her, then she left speaking to her.

<span id="an_1:19">1:19</span> So they two went until they came to
Beth-lehem. And it came to pass, when they had come to Beth-lehem, that
all the city was moved about them, and they said, Is this Naomi?

<span id="an_1:20">1:20</span> And she said to them, Call me not Naomi,
call me Mara: for the Almighty hath dealt very bitterly with me.

<span id="an_1:21">1:21</span> I went out full, and the LORD hath
brought me home again empty: why then call ye me Naomi, seeing the LORD
hath testified against me, and the Almighty hath afflicted me?

<span id="an_1:22">1:22</span> So Naomi returned, and Ruth the Moabitess
her daughter-in-law with her, who returned from the country of Moab: and
they came to Beth-lehem in the beginning of barley-harvest.

<span id="an_2:1">2:1</span> And Naomi had a kinsman of her husband's, a
mighty man of wealth, of the family of Elimelech; and his name was Boaz.

<span id="an_2:2">2:2</span> And Ruth the Moabitess said to Naomi, Let
me now go to the field, and glean ears of corn after him in whose sight
I shall find grace. And she said to her, Go, my daughter.

<span id="an_2:3">2:3</span> And she went, and came, and gleaned in the
field after the reapers: and her lot was to light on a part of the field
belonging to Boaz, who was of the kindred of Elimelech.

<span id="an_2:4">2:4</span> And behold, Boaz came from Beth-lehem, and
said to the reapers, The LORD be with you. And they answered him, The
LORD bless thee.

<span id="an_2:5">2:5</span> Then said Boaz to his servant that was set
over the reapers, Whose damsel is this?

<span id="an_2:6">2:6</span> And the servant that was set over the
reapers answered and said, It is the Moabitish damsel that came back
with Naomi from the country of Moab:

<span id="an_2:7">2:7</span> And she said, I pray you, let me glean and
gather after the reapers among the sheaves: so she came, and hath
continued even from the morning until now, that she tarried a little in
the house.

<span id="an_2:8">2:8</span> Then said Boaz to Ruth, Hearest thou not,
my daughter? Go not to glean in another field, neither go from hence,
but abide here fast by my maidens:

<span id="an_2:9">2:9</span> Let thy eyes be on the field that they are
reaping, and go thou after them: have I not charged the young men that
they shall not touch thee? and when thou art thirsty go to the vessels,
and drink of that which the young men have drawn.

<span id="an_2:10">2:10</span> Then she fell on her face, and bowed
herself to the ground, and said to him, Why have I found grace in thy
eyes, that thou shouldst take knowledge of me, seeing I am a stranger?

<span id="an_2:11">2:11</span> And Boaz answered and said to her, It
hath fully been shown to me, all that thou hast done to thy
mother-in-law since the death of thy husband: and how thou hast left thy
father and thy mother, and the land of thy nativity, and hast come to a
people which thou knewest not heretofore.

<span id="an_2:12">2:12</span> The LORD recompense thy work, and a full
reward be given thee of the LORD God of Israel, under whose wings thou
hast come to trust.

<span id="an_2:13">2:13</span> Then she said, Let me find favor in thy
sight, my lord; for that thou hast comforted me, and for that thou hast
spoken kindly to thy handmaid, though I am not like to one of thy
handmaidens.

<span id="an_2:14">2:14</span> And Boaz said to her, At meal-time come
thou hither, and eat of the bread, and dip thy morsel in the vinegar.
And she sat beside the reapers: and he reached her parched corn, and she
ate, and was satisfied, and left.

<span id="an_2:15">2:15</span> And when she had risen to glean, Boaz
commanded his young men, saying, Let her glean even among the sheaves,
and reproach her not:

<span id="an_2:16">2:16</span> And let fall also some of the handfuls of
purpose for her, and leave them, that she may glean them, and rebuke her
not.

<span id="an_2:17">2:17</span> So she gleaned in the field until
evening, and beat out that which she had gleaned: and it was about an
ephah of barley.

<span id="an_2:18">2:18</span> And she took it, and went into the city:
and her mother-in-law saw what she had gleaned: and she brought forth,
and gave to her what she had reserved after she was satisfied.

<span id="an_2:19">2:19</span> And her mother-in-law said to her, Where
hast thou gleaned to-day? and where hast thou labored? blessed be he
that took knowledge of thee. And she showed her mother-in-law with whom
she had wrought, and said, The man's name with whom I wrought to-day is
Boaz.

<span id="an_2:20">2:20</span> And Naomi said to her daughter-in-law,
Blessed be he of the LORD, who hath not left off his kindness to the
living and to the dead. And Naomi said to her, The man is near of kin to
us, one of our next kinsmen.

<span id="an_2:21">2:21</span> And Ruth the Moabitess said, He said to
me also, Thou shalt keep fast by my young men, until they have ended all
my harvest.

<span id="an_2:22">2:22</span> And Naomi said to Ruth her
daughter-in-law, It is good, my daughter, that thou shouldst go out with
his maidens, that they meet thee not in any other field.

<span id="an_2:23">2:23</span> So she kept fast by the maidens of Boaz
to glean to the end of barley-harvest and of wheat-harvest; and dwelt
with her mother-in-law.

<span id="an_3:1">3:1</span> Then Naomi her mother-in-law said to her,
My daughter, shall I not seek rest for thee, that it may be well with
thee?

<span id="an_3:2">3:2</span> And now is not Boaz of our kindred, with
whose maidens thou wast? Behold, he winnoweth barley to-night in the
threshing-floor.

<span id="an_3:3">3:3</span> Wash thyself therefore, and anoint thee,
and put thy raiment upon thee, and go down to the floor: but make not
thyself known to the man, until he shall have done eating and drinking.

<span id="an_3:4">3:4</span> And it shall be when he lieth down, that
thou shalt mark the place where he shall lie, and thou shalt go in, and
uncover his feet, and lay thee down; and he will tell thee what thou
shalt do.

<span id="an_3:5">3:5</span> And she said to her, All that thou sayest
to me I will do.

<span id="an_3:6">3:6</span> And she went down to the floor, and did
according to all that her mother-in-law bade her.

<span id="an_3:7">3:7</span> And when Boaz had eaten and drank, and his
heart was merry, he went to lie down at the end of the heap of corn: and
she came softly, and uncovered his feet, and laid herself down.

<span id="an_3:8">3:8</span> And it came to pass at midnight, that the
man was afraid, and turned himself: and behold, a woman lay at his feet.

<span id="an_3:9">3:9</span> And he said, Who art thou? And she
answered, I am Ruth thy handmaid: spread therefore thy skirt over thy
handmaid; for thou art a near kinsman.

<span id="an_3:10">3:10</span> And he said, Blessed be thou of the LORD,
my daughter: for thou hast shown more kindness in the latter end than at
the beginning, inasmuch as thou didst not follow young men, whether poor
or rich.

<span id="an_3:11">3:11</span> And now, my daughter, fear not; I will do
to thee all that thou requirest: for all the city of my people doth know
that thou art a virtuous woman.

<span id="an_3:12">3:12</span> And now it is true that I am thy near
kinsman: yet there is a kinsman nearer than I.

<span id="an_3:13">3:13</span> Tarry this night, and it shall be in the
morning, that if he will perform to thee the part of a kinsman, well;
let him do the kinsman's part: but if he will not do the part of a
kinsman to thee, then will I do the part of a kinsman to thee, as the
LORD liveth: lie down until the morning.

<span id="an_3:14">3:14</span> And she lay at his feet until the
morning: and she rose before one could know another. And he said, Let it
not be known that a woman came to the floor.

<span id="an_3:15">3:15</span> Also he said, Bring the vail that thou
hast upon thee, and hold it. And when she held it, he measured six
measures of barley, and laid it on her: and she went into the city.

<span id="an_3:16">3:16</span> And when she came to her mother-in-law,
she said, Who art thou, my daughter? And she told her all that the man
had done to her.

<span id="an_3:17">3:17</span> And she said, These six measures of
barley he gave me; for he said to me, Go not empty to thy mother-in-law.

<span id="an_3:18">3:18</span> Then said she, Sit still, my daughter,
until thou knowest how the matter will fall: for the man will not be in
rest, until he hath finished the thing this day.

<span id="an_4:1">4:1</span> Then Boaz went up to the gate, and sat down
there: and behold, the kinsman of whom Boaz spoke came by; to whom he
said, Ho, such a one! turn aside, sit down here. And he turned aside,
and sat down.

<span id="an_4:2">4:2</span> And he took ten men of the elders of the
city, and said, Sit ye down here. And they sat down.

<span id="an_4:3">4:3</span> And he said to the kinsman, Naomi, that has
come again out of the country of Moab, selleth a parcel of land, which
was our brother Elimelech's:

<span id="an_4:4">4:4</span> And I thought to advertise thee, saying,
Buy it before the inhabitants, and before the elders of my people. If
thou wilt redeem it, redeem it: but if thou wilt not redeem it, then
tell me, that I may know: for there is none to redeem it besides thee;
and I am after thee. And he said, I will redeem it.

<span id="an_4:5">4:5</span> Then said Boaz, What day thou buyest the
field of the hand of Naomi, thou must buy it also of Ruth the Moabitess,
the wife of the dead, to raise up the name of the dead upon his
inheritance.

<span id="an_4:6">4:6</span> And the kinsman said, I cannot redeem it
for myself, lest I mar my own inheritance: redeem thou my right to
thyself; for I cannot redeem it.

<span id="an_4:7">4:7</span> Now this was the manner in former time in
Israel concerning redeeming and concerning changing, for confirming all
things; a man plucked off his shoe, and gave it to his neighbor: and
this was a testimony in Israel.

<span id="an_4:8">4:8</span> Therefore the kinsman said to Boaz, Buy it
for thyself. So he drew off his shoe.

<span id="an_4:9">4:9</span> And Boaz said to the elders, and to all the
people, Ye are witnesses this day, that I have bought all that was
Elimelech's, and all that was Chilion's and Mahlon's, of the hand of
Naomi.

<span id="an_4:10">4:10</span> Moreover, Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of
Mahlon, have I purchased to be my wife, to raise up the name of the dead
upon his inheritance, that the name of the dead be not cut off from
among his brethren, and from the gate of his place: ye are witnesses
this day.

<span id="an_4:11">4:11</span> And all the people that were in the gate,
and the elders said, We are witnesses. The LORD make the woman that hath
come into thy house like Rachel and like Leah, which two did build the
house of Israel: and do thou worthily in Ephratah, and be famous in
Beth-lehem:

<span id="an_4:12">4:12</span> And let thy house be like the house of
Pharez, whom Tamar bore to Judah, of the seed which the LORD shall give
thee of this young woman.

<span id="an_4:13">4:13</span> So Boaz took Ruth, and she was his wife:
and when he went in to her, the LORD gave her conception, and she bore a
son.

<span id="an_4:14">4:14</span> And the women said to Naomi, Blessed be
the LORD, who hath not left thee this day without a kinsman, that his
name may be famous in Israel.

<span id="an_4:15">4:15</span> And he shall be to thee a restorer of thy
life, and a nourisher of thy old age: for thy daughter-in-law, who
loveth thee, who is better to thee than seven sons, hath borne him.

<span id="an_4:16">4:16</span> And Naomi took the child, and laid it in
her bosom, and became its nurse.

<span id="an_4:17">4:17</span> And the women, her neighbors, gave it a
name, saying, There is a son born to Naomi; and they called his name
Obed: he is the father of Jesse, the father of David.

<span id="an_4:18">4:18</span> Now these are the generations of Pharez:
Pharez begat Hezron,

<span id="an_4:19">4:19</span> And Hezron begat Ram, and Ram begat
Amminadab,

<span id="an_4:20">4:20</span> And Amminadab begat Nahshon, and Nahshon
begat Salmon,

<span id="an_4:21">4:21</span> And Salmon begat Boaz, and Boaz begat
Obed,

<span id="an_4:22">4:22</span> And Obed begat Jesse, and Jesse begat
David.
