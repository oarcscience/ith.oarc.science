### Webster's Bible: 2 Kings

<span id="an_1:1">1:1</span> Then Moab rebelled against Israel after the
death of Ahab.

<span id="an_1:2">1:2</span> And Ahaziah fell down through a lattice in
his upper chamber that was in Samaria, and was sick: and he sent
messengers, and said to them, Go, inquire of Baal-zebub the god of
Ekron, whether I shall recover from this disease.

<span id="an_1:3">1:3</span> But the angel of the LORD said to Elijah
the Tishbite, Arise, go up to meet the messengers of the king of
Samaria, and say to them, Is it not because there is not a God in
Israel, that ye go to inquire of Baal-zebub the god of Ekron?

<span id="an_1:4">1:4</span> Now therefore thus saith the LORD, Thou
shalt not come down from that bed on which thou art gone up, but shalt
surely die. And Elijah departed.

<span id="an_1:5">1:5</span> And when the messengers turned back to him,
he said to them, Why have ye now returned?

<span id="an_1:6">1:6</span> And they said to him, There came up a man
to meet us, and said to us, Go, turn again to the king that sent you,
and say to him, Thus saith the LORD, Is it not because there is not a
God in Israel, that thou sendest to inquire of Baal-zebub the god of
Ekron? therefore thou shalt not come down from that bed on which thou
art gone up, but shalt surely die.

<span id="an_1:7">1:7</span> And he said to them, What manner of man was
he who came up to meet you, and told you these words?

<span id="an_1:8">1:8</span> And they answered him, He was a hairy man,
and girt with a girdle of leather about his loins. And he said, It is
Elijah the Tishbite.

<span id="an_1:9">1:9</span> Then the king sent to him a captain of
fifty with his fifty. And he went up to him: and behold, he sat on the
top of a hill. And he spoke to him, Thou man of God, the king hath said,
Come down.

<span id="an_1:10">1:10</span> And Elijah answered and said to the
captain of fifty, If I am a man of God, then let fire come down from
heaven, and consume thee and thy fifty. And there came down fire from
heaven, and consumed him and his fifty.

<span id="an_1:11">1:11</span> Again also he sent to him another captain
of fifty with his fifty. And he answered and said to him, O man of God,
thus hath the king said, Come down quickly.

<span id="an_1:12">1:12</span> And Elijah answered and said to them, If
I am a man of God, let fire come down from heaven, and consume thee and
thy fifty. And the fire of God came down from heaven, and consumed him
and his fifty.

<span id="an_1:13">1:13</span> And he sent again a captain of the third
fifty with his fifty. And the third captain of fifty went up, and came
and fell on his knees before Elijah, and besought him, and said to him,
O man of God, I pray thee, let my life, and the life of these fifty thy
servants, be precious in thy sight.

<span id="an_1:14">1:14</span> Behold, there came fire down from heaven,
and burnt up the two captains of the former fifties with their fifties:
therefore let my life now be precious in thy sight.

<span id="an_1:15">1:15</span> And the angel of the LORD said to Elijah,
Go down with him: be not afraid of him. And he arose, and went down with
him to the king.

<span id="an_1:16">1:16</span> And he said to him, Thus saith the LORD,
Forasmuch as thou hast sent messengers to inquire of Baal-zebub the god
of Ekron, is it not because there is no God in Israel to inquire of his
word? therefore thou shalt not come down off that bed on which thou art
gone up, but shalt surely die.

<span id="an_1:17">1:17</span> So he died according to the word of the
LORD which Elijah had spoken. And Jehoram reigned in his stead in the
second year of Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah; because he
had no son.

<span id="an_1:18">1:18</span> Now the rest of the acts of Ahaziah which
he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings
of Israel?

<span id="an_2:1">2:1</span> And it came to pass, when the LORD would
take up Elijah into heaven by a whirlwind, that Elijah went with Elisha
from Gilgal.

<span id="an_2:2">2:2</span> And Elijah said to Elisha, Tarry here, I
pray thee; for the LORD hath sent me to Beth-el. And Elisha said, As the
LORD liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. So they went
down to Beth-el.

<span id="an_2:3">2:3</span> And the sons of the prophets that were at
Beth-el came forth to Elisha, and said to him, Knowest thou that the
LORD will take away thy master from thy head to-day? And he said, Yes, I
know it; hold ye your peace.

<span id="an_2:4">2:4</span> And Elijah said to him, Elisha, tarry here,
I pray thee; for the LORD hath sent me to Jericho. And he said, As the
LORD liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. So they came
to Jericho.

<span id="an_2:5">2:5</span> And the sons of the prophets that were at
Jericho came to Elisha, and said to him, Knowest thou that the LORD will
take away thy master from thy head to-day? And he answered, Yes, I know
it; hold ye your peace.

<span id="an_2:6">2:6</span> And Elijah said to him, Tarry here, I pray
thee; for the LORD hath sent me to Jordan. And he said, As the LORD
liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. And they two went
on.

<span id="an_2:7">2:7</span> And fifty men of the sons of the prophets
went, and stood to view afar off: and they two stood by Jordan.

<span id="an_2:8">2:8</span> And Elijah took his mantle, and wrapped it
together, and smote the waters, and they were divided hither and
thither, so that they two went over on dry ground.

<span id="an_2:9">2:9</span> And it came to pass, when they had gone
over, that Elijah said to Elisha, Ask what I shall do for thee, before I
am taken away from thee. And Elisha said, I pray thee, let a double
portion of thy spirit be upon me.

<span id="an_2:10">2:10</span> And he said, Thou hast asked a hard
thing: nevertheless, if thou shalt see me when I am taken from thee, it
shall be so to thee; but if not, it shall not be so.

<span id="an_2:11">2:11</span> And it came to pass, as they still went
on, and talked, that behold, there appeared a chariot of fire, and
horses of fire, and parted them both asunder; and Elijah went up by a
whirlwind into heaven.

<span id="an_2:12">2:12</span> And Elisha saw it, and he cried, My
father, my father, the chariot of Israel, and the horsemen thereof. And
he saw him no more: and he took hold of his own clothes, and rent them
in two pieces.

<span id="an_2:13">2:13</span> He took up also the mantle of Elijah that
fell from him, and went back, and stood by the bank of Jordan;

<span id="an_2:14">2:14</span> And he took the mantle of Elijah that
fell from him, and smote the waters, and said, Where is the LORD God of
Elijah? And when he also had smitten the waters, they parted hither and
thither: and Elisha went over.

<span id="an_2:15">2:15</span> And when the sons of the prophets who
were to view at Jericho, saw him, they said, The spirit of Elijah doth
rest on Elisha. And they came to meet him, and bowed themselves to the
ground before him.

<span id="an_2:16">2:16</span> And they said to him, Behold now, there
are with thy servants fifty strong men; let them go, we pray thee, and
seek thy master: lest perhaps the Spirit of the LORD hath taken him up,
and cast him upon some mountain, or into some valley. And he said, Ye
shall not send.

<span id="an_2:17">2:17</span> And when they urged him till he was
ashamed, he said, Send. They sent therefore fifty men; and they sought
three days, but found him not.

<span id="an_2:18">2:18</span> And when they came again to him, (for he
tarried at Jericho,) he said to them, Did I not say to you, Go not?

<span id="an_2:19">2:19</span> And the men of the city said to Elisha,
Behold, I pray thee, the situation of this city is pleasant, as my lord
seeth: but the water is bad, and the ground barren.

<span id="an_2:20">2:20</span> And he said, Bring me a new cruse, and
put salt therein. And they brought it to him.

<span id="an_2:21">2:21</span> And he went forth to the spring of the
waters, and cast the salt in there, and said, Thus saith the LORD, I
have healed these waters; there shall not be from thence any more death
or barren land.

<span id="an_2:22">2:22</span> So the waters were healed to this day,
according to the saying of Elisha which he spoke.

<span id="an_2:23">2:23</span> And he went up from thence to Beth-el:
and as he was going up by the way, there came forth little children out
of the city, and mocked him, and said to him, Go up, thou bald-head; go
up, thou bald-head.

<span id="an_2:24">2:24</span> And he turned back, and looked on them,
and cursed them in the name of the LORD. And there came forth two she
bears out of the wood, and tore forty and two children of them.

<span id="an_2:25">2:25</span> And he went from thence to mount Carmel,
and from thence he returned to Samaria.

<span id="an_3:1">3:1</span> Now Jehoram the son of Ahab began to reign
over Israel in Samaria in the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat king of
Judah, and reigned twelve years.

<span id="an_3:2">3:2</span> And he wrought evil in the sight of the
LORD; but not like his father, and like his mother: for he put away the
image of Baal that his father had made.

<span id="an_3:3">3:3</span> Nevertheless, he cleaved to the sins of
Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin; he departed not
therefrom.

<span id="an_3:4">3:4</span> And Mesha king of Moab was a sheep-master,
and rendered to the king of Israel a hundred thousand lambs, and a
hundred thousand rams, with the wool.

<span id="an_3:5">3:5</span> But it came to pass, when Ahab was dead,
that the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel.

<span id="an_3:6">3:6</span> And king Jehoram went out of Samaria the
same time, and numbered all Israel.

<span id="an_3:7">3:7</span> And he went and sent to Jehoshaphat the
king of Judah, saying, The king of Moab hath rebelled against me: wilt
thou go with me against Moab to battle? And he said, I will go: I am as
thou art, my people as thy people, and my horses as thy horses.

<span id="an_3:8">3:8</span> And he said, which way shall we go up? And
he answered, The way through the wilderness of Edom.

<span id="an_3:9">3:9</span> So the king of Israel went, and the king of
Judah, and the king of Edom: and they fetched a compass of seven days'
journey: and there was no water for the army, and for the cattle that
followed them.

<span id="an_3:10">3:10</span> And the king of Israel said, Alas! that
the LORD hath called these three kings together, to deliver them into
the hand of Moab!

<span id="an_3:11">3:11</span> But Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a
prophet of the LORD, that we may inquire of the LORD by him? And one of
the king of Israel's servants answered and said, Here is Elisha the son
of Shaphat, who poured water on the hands of Elijah.

<span id="an_3:12">3:12</span> And Jehoshaphat said, The word of the
LORD is with him. So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of
Edom went down to him.

<span id="an_3:13">3:13</span> And Elisha said to the king of Israel,
What have I to do with thee? go to the prophets of thy father, and to
the prophets of thy mother. And the king of Israel said to him, No: for
the LORD hath called these three kings together, to deliver them into
the hand of Moab.

<span id="an_3:14">3:14</span> And Elisha said, As the LORD of hosts
liveth, before whom I stand, surely, were it not that I regard the
presence of Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, I would not look towards
thee, nor see thee.

<span id="an_3:15">3:15</span> But now bring me a minstrel. And it came
to pass, when the minstrel played, that the hand of the LORD came upon
him.

<span id="an_3:16">3:16</span> And he said, Thus saith the LORD, Make
this valley full of ditches.

<span id="an_3:17">3:17</span> For thus saith the LORD, Ye shall not see
wind, neither shall ye see rain; yet that valley shall be filled with
water, that ye may drink, both ye, and your cattle, and your beasts.

<span id="an_3:18">3:18</span> And this is but a light thing in the
sight of the LORD: he will deliver the Moabites also into your hand.

<span id="an_3:19">3:19</span> And ye shall smite every fortified city,
and every choice city, and shall fell every good tree, and stop all
wells of water, and mar every good piece of land with stones.

<span id="an_3:20">3:20</span> And it came to pass in the morning, when
the meat-offering was offered, that behold, there came water by the way
of Edom, and the country was filled with water.

<span id="an_3:21">3:21</span> And when all the Moabites heard that the
kings were come up to fight against them, they gathered all that were
able to put on armor, and upward, and stood in the border.

<span id="an_3:22">3:22</span> And they rose early in the morning, and
the sun shone upon the water, and the Moabites saw the water on the
other side as red as blood:

<span id="an_3:23">3:23</span> And they said, This is blood: the kings
are surely slain, and they have smitten one another: now therefore,
Moab, to the spoil.

<span id="an_3:24">3:24</span> And when they came to the camp of Israel,
the Israelites rose and smote the Moabites, so that they fled before
them: but they went forward smiting the Moabites, even in their country.

<span id="an_3:25">3:25</span> And they beat down the cities, and on
every good piece of land cast every man his stone, and filled it; and
they stopped all the wells of water, and felled all the good trees: only
in Kirhara-seth they left the stones of it; but the slingers went about
it, and smote it.

<span id="an_3:26">3:26</span> And when the king of Moab saw that the
battle was too severe for him, he took with him seven hundred men that
drew swords, to break through to the king of Edom: but they could not.

<span id="an_3:27">3:27</span> Then he took his eldest son that was to
reign in his stead, and offered him for a burnt-offering upon the wall.
And there was great indignation against Israel: And they departed from
him, and returned to their own land.

<span id="an_4:1">4:1</span> Now there cried a certain woman of the
wives of the sons of the prophets to Elisha, saying, Thy servant my
husband is dead; and thou knowest that thy servant feared the LORD: and
the creditor hath come to take to him my two sons to be bond-men.

<span id="an_4:2">4:2</span> And Elisha said to her, What shall I do for
thee? tell me, what hast thou in the house? And she said, Thy handmaid
hath not any thing in the house, save a pot of oil.

<span id="an_4:3">4:3</span> Then he said, Go, borrow thee vessels
abroad of all thy neighbors, even empty vessels; borrow not a few.

<span id="an_4:4">4:4</span> And when thou hast come in, thou shalt shut
the door upon thee and upon thy sons, and shalt pour out into all those
vessels, and thou shalt set aside that which is full.

<span id="an_4:5">4:5</span> So she went from him, and shut the door
upon her and upon her sons, who brought the vessels to her; and she
poured out.

<span id="an_4:6">4:6</span> And it came to pass, when the vessels were
full, that she said to her son, Bring me yet a vessel. And he said to
her, There is not a vessel more. And the oil stayed.

<span id="an_4:7">4:7</span> Then she came and told the man of God. And
he said, Go, sell the oil, and pay thy debt, and live thou and thy
children on the remainder.

<span id="an_4:8">4:8</span> And it fell on a day, that Elisha passed to
Shunem, where was a distinguished woman; and she constrained him to eat
bread. And so it was, that as oft as he passed by, he turned in thither
to eat bread.

<span id="an_4:9">4:9</span> And she said to her husband, Behold now, I
perceive that this is a holy man of God, who passeth by us continually.

<span id="an_4:10">4:10</span> Let us make a little chamber, I pray
thee, on the wall; and let us set for him there a bed, and a table, and
a stool, and a candlestick: and it shall be, when he cometh to us, that
he shall turn in thither.

<span id="an_4:11">4:11</span> And it fell on a day, that he came
thither, and he turned into the chamber, and lay there.

<span id="an_4:12">4:12</span> And he said to Gehazi his servant, Call
this Shunamite. And when he had called her, she stood before him.

<span id="an_4:13">4:13</span> And he said to him, Say now to her,
Behold, thou hast been careful for us with all this care; what is to be
done for thee? wouldst thou be spoken for to the king, or to the captain
of the host? And she answered, I dwell among my own people.

<span id="an_4:14">4:14</span> And he said, What then is to be done for
her? And Gehazi answered, Verily she hath no child, and her husband is
old.

<span id="an_4:15">4:15</span> And he said, Call her. And when he had
called her, she stood in the door.

<span id="an_4:16">4:16</span> And he said, About this season, according
to the time of life, thou shalt embrace a son. And she said, No, my
lord, thou man of God, do not lie to thy handmaid.

<span id="an_4:17">4:17</span> And the woman conceived, and bore a son
at that season that Elisha had said to her, according to the time of
life.

<span id="an_4:18">4:18</span> And when the child was grown, it happened
on a day, that he went out to his father to the reapers.

<span id="an_4:19">4:19</span> And he said to his father, My head, my
head. And he said to a lad, Carry him to his mother.

<span id="an_4:20">4:20</span> And when he had taken him, and brought
him to his mother, he sat on her knees till noon, and then died.

<span id="an_4:21">4:21</span> And she went up, and laid him on the bed
of the man of God, and shut the door upon him, and went out.

<span id="an_4:22">4:22</span> And she called to her husband, and said,
Send me, I pray thee, one of the young men, and one of the asses, that I
may run to the man of God, and come again.

<span id="an_4:23">4:23</span> And he said, Why wilt thou go to him
to-day? it is neither new-moon, nor sabbath. And she said, It shall be
well.

<span id="an_4:24">4:24</span> Then she saddled an ass, and said to her
servant, Drive, and go forward; slack not thy riding for me, except I
bid thee.

<span id="an_4:25">4:25</span> So she went and came to the man of God to
mount Carmel. And it came to pass, when the man of God saw her afar off,
that he said to Gehazi his servant, Behold, yonder is that Shunamite:

<span id="an_4:26">4:26</span> Run now, I pray thee, to meet her, and
say to her, Is it well with thee? Is it well with thy husband? Is it
well with the child? and she answered, It is well.

<span id="an_4:27">4:27</span> And when she came to the man of God to
the hill, she caught him by the feet: but Gehazi came near to thrust her
away. And the man of God said, Let her alone; for her soul is sorrowful
within her: and the LORD hath hid it from me, and hath not told me?

<span id="an_4:28">4:28</span> Then she said, Did I ask a son from my
lord? did I not say, Do not deceive me.

<span id="an_4:29">4:29</span> Then he said to Gehazi, Gird up thy loins
and take my staff in thy hand, and go thy way: and if thou shalt meet
any man, salute him not; and if any shall salute thee, answer him not
again: and lay my staff upon the face of the child.

<span id="an_4:30">4:30</span> And the mother of the child said, As the
LORD liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. And he
arose, and followed her.

<span id="an_4:31">4:31</span> And Gehazi passed on before them, and
laid the staff upon the face of the child; but there was neither voice,
nor hearing. Wherefore he went again to meet him, and told him, saying,
The child is not awaked.

<span id="an_4:32">4:32</span> And when Elisha had come into the house,
behold, the child was dead, and laid upon his bed.

<span id="an_4:33">4:33</span> He went in therefore, and shut the door
upon them both, and prayed to the LORD.

<span id="an_4:34">4:34</span> And he went up, and lay upon the child,
and put his mouth upon his mouth, and his eyes upon his eyes, and his
hands upon his hands: and he stretched himself upon the child; and the
flesh of the child became warm.

<span id="an_4:35">4:35</span> Then he returned, and walked in the house
to and fro; and went up, and stretched himself upon him: and the child
sneezed seven times, and the child opened his eyes.

<span id="an_4:36">4:36</span> And he called Gehazi, and said, Call this
Shunamite. So he called her. And when she had come in to him, he said,
Take up thy son.

<span id="an_4:37">4:37</span> Then she went in, and fell at his feet,
and bowed herself to the ground, and took up her son, and went out.

<span id="an_4:38">4:38</span> And Elisha came again to Gilgal. And
there was a dearth in the land; and the sons of the prophets were
sitting before him: and he said to his servant, Set on the great pot,
and boil pottage for the sons of the prophets.

<span id="an_4:39">4:39</span> And one went out into the field to gather
herbs, and found a wild vine, and gathered from it wild gourds his lap
full, and came and shred them into the pot of pottage: for they knew
them not.

<span id="an_4:40">4:40</span> So they poured out for the men to eat.
And it came to pass, as they were eating of the pottage, that they cried
out, and said, O thou man of God, there is death in the pot. And they
could not eat of it.

<span id="an_4:41">4:41</span> But he said, Then bring meal. And he cast
it into the pot; and he said, Pour out for the people, that they may
eat. And there was no harm in the pot.

<span id="an_4:42">4:42</span> And there came a man from Baal-shalisha,
and brought the man of God bread of the first fruits, twenty loaves of
barley, and full ears of corn in its husk. And he said, Give to the
people, that they may eat.

<span id="an_4:43">4:43</span> And his servitor said, What, should I set
this before a hundred men? He said again, Give the people, that they may
eat: for thus saith the LORD, They shall eat, and shall leave of it.

<span id="an_4:44">4:44</span> So he set it before them, and they ate,
and left of it, according to the word of the LORD.

<span id="an_5:1">5:1</span> Now Naaman, captain of the army of the king
of Syria, was a great man with his master, and honorable, because by him
the LORD had given deliverance to Syria: he was also a mighty man in
valor, but he was a leper.

<span id="an_5:2">5:2</span> And the Syrians had gone out by companies,
and had brought away captive out of the land of Israel a little maid;
and she waited on Naaman's wife.

<span id="an_5:3">5:3</span> And she said to her mistress, I would that
my lord were with the prophet that is in Samaria! for he would recover
him of his leprosy.

<span id="an_5:4">5:4</span> And one went in, and told his lord, saying,
Thus and thus said the maid that is of the land of Israel.

<span id="an_5:5">5:5</span> And the king of Syria said, Come, go, and I
will send a letter to the king of Israel. And he departed, and took with
him ten talents of silver, and six thousand pieces of gold, and ten
changes of raiment.

<span id="an_5:6">5:6</span> And he brought the letter to the king of
Israel, saying, Now when this letter hath come to thee, behold, I have
with this sent Naaman my servant to thee, that thou mayest recover him
of his leprosy.

<span id="an_5:7">5:7</span> And it came to pass, when the king of
Israel had read the letter, that he rent his clothes, and said, Am I
God, to kill and to make alive, that this man doth send to me to recover
a man of his leprosy? wherefore consider, I pray you, and see how he
seeketh a quarrel against me.

<span id="an_5:8">5:8</span> And it was so, when Elisha the man of God
had heard that the king of Israel had rent his clothes, that he sent to
the king, saying, Why hast thou rent thy clothes? let him come now to
me, and he shall know that there is a prophet in Israel.

<span id="an_5:9">5:9</span> So Naaman came with his horses and with his
chariot, and stood at the door of the house of Elisha.

<span id="an_5:10">5:10</span> And Elisha sent a messenger to him,
saying, Go and wash in Jordan seven times, and thy flesh shall come
again to thee, and thou shalt be clean.

<span id="an_5:11">5:11</span> But Naaman was wroth, and went away, and
said, Behold, I thought, He will surely come out to me, and stand, and
call on the name of the LORD his God, and strike his hand over the
place, and recover the leper.

<span id="an_5:12">5:12</span> Are not Abana and Pharpar, rivers of
Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? may I not wash in them,
and be clean? So he turned and went away in a rage.

<span id="an_5:13">5:13</span> And his servants came near, and spoke to
him, and said, My father, if the prophet had bid thee do some great
thing, wouldst thou not have done it? how much rather then, when he
saith to thee, Wash, and be clean?

<span id="an_5:14">5:14</span> Then he went down, and dipped himself
seven times in Jordan, according to the saying of the man of God: and
his flesh came again like the flesh of a little child, and he was clean.

<span id="an_5:15">5:15</span> And he returned to the man of God, he and
all his company, and came and stood before him: and he said, Behold, now
I know that there is no God in all the earth, but in Israel: now
therefore, I pray thee, take a blessing from thy servant.

<span id="an_5:16">5:16</span> But he said, As the LORD liveth, before
whom I stand, I will receive none. And he urged him to take it; but he
refused.

<span id="an_5:17">5:17</span> And Naaman said, Shall there not then, I
pray thee, be given to thy servant two mules burden of earth? for thy
servant will henceforth offer neither burnt-offering nor sacrifice to
other gods, but to the LORD.

<span id="an_5:18">5:18</span> In this thing the LORD pardon thy
servant, that when my master goeth into the house of Rimmon to worship
there, and he leaneth on my hand, and I bow myself in the house of
Rimmon: when I bow down myself in the house of Rimmon, the LORD pardon
thy servant in this thing.

<span id="an_5:19">5:19</span> And he said to him, Go in peace. So he
departed from him a little way.

<span id="an_5:20">5:20</span> But Gehazi, the servant of Elisha the man
of God, said, Behold, my master hath spared Naaman this Syrian, in not
receiving at his hands that which he brought: but as the LORD liveth, I
will run after him, and take somewhat from him.

<span id="an_5:21">5:21</span> So Gehazi followed after Naaman. And when
Naaman saw him running after him, he lighted down from the chariot to
meet him, and said, Is all well?

<span id="an_5:22">5:22</span> And he said, All is well. My master hath
sent me, saying, Behold, even now there have come to me from mount
Ephraim two young men of the sons of the prophets: give them, I pray
thee, a talent of silver, and two changes of garments.

<span id="an_5:23">5:23</span> And Naaman said, Be content, take two
talents. And he urged him, and bound two talents of silver in two bags,
with two changes of garments, and laid them upon two of his servants;
and they bore them before him.

<span id="an_5:24">5:24</span> And when he came to the tower, he took
them from their hand, and bestowed them in the house: and he let the men
go, and they departed.

<span id="an_5:25">5:25</span> But he went in, and stood before his
master: and Elisha said to him, Whence comest thou Gehazi? and he said,
Thy servant went no whither.

<span id="an_5:26">5:26</span> And he said to him, Went not my heart
with thee, when the man turned again from his chariot to meet thee? Is
it a time to receive money, and to receive garments, and olive-yards,
and vineyards, and sheep, and oxen, and men-servants, and maid-servants?

<span id="an_5:27">5:27</span> The leprosy therefore of Naaman shall
cleave to thee, and to thy seed for ever. And he went out from his
presence a leper as white as snow.

<span id="an_6:1">6:1</span> And the sons of the prophets said to
Elisha, Behold now, the place where we dwell with thee is too narrow for
us.

<span id="an_6:2">6:2</span> Let us go, we pray thee, to Jordan, and
take thence every man a beam, and let us make us a place there, where we
may dwell. And he answered, Go ye.

<span id="an_6:3">6:3</span> And one said, Be content, I pray thee, and
go with thy servants. And he answered, I will go.

<span id="an_6:4">6:4</span> So he went with them. And when they came to
Jordan, they cut down wood.

<span id="an_6:5">6:5</span> But as one was felling a beam, the ax head
fell into the water: and he cried, and said, Alas, master! for it was
borrowed.

<span id="an_6:6">6:6</span> And the man of God said, Where fell it? And
he showed him the place. And he cut down a stick, and cast it in
thither; and the iron floated.

<span id="an_6:7">6:7</span> Therefore said he, Take it up to thee. And
he put out his hand, and took it.

<span id="an_6:8">6:8</span> Then the king of Syria warred against
Israel, and took counsel with his servants, saying, In such and such a
place shall be my camp.

<span id="an_6:9">6:9</span> And the man of God sent to the king of
Israel, saying, Beware that thou pass not such a place; for thither the
Syrians have come down.

<span id="an_6:10">6:10</span> And the king of Israel sent to the place
which the man of God told him and warned him of, and saved himself
there, not once nor twice.

<span id="an_6:11">6:11</span> Therefore the heart of the king of Syria
was greatly troubled for this thing; and he called his servants, and
said to them, Will ye not show me which of us is for the king of Israel?

<span id="an_6:12">6:12</span> And one of his servants said, None, my
lord, O king: but Elisha, the prophet that is in Israel, telleth the
king of Israel the words that thou speakest in thy bed-chamber.

<span id="an_6:13">6:13</span> And he said, Go, and spy where he is,
that I may send and bring him. And it was told him, saying, Behold, he
is in Dothan.

<span id="an_6:14">6:14</span> Therefore he sent thither horses, and
chariots, and a great host: and they came by night, and encompassed the
city.

<span id="an_6:15">6:15</span> And when the servant of the man of God
had risen early, and gone forth, behold, a host compassed the city both
with horses and chariots. And his servant said to him, Alas, my master!
how shall we do?

<span id="an_6:16">6:16</span> And he answered, Fear not: for they that
are with us are more than they that are with them.

<span id="an_6:17">6:17</span> And Elisha prayed, and said, LORD, I pray
thee, open his eyes, that he may see. And the LORD opened the eyes of
the young man; and he saw: and behold, the mountain was full of horses
and chariots of fire around Elisha.

<span id="an_6:18">6:18</span> And when they came down to him, Elisha
prayed to the LORD, and said, Smite this people, I pray thee, with
blindness. And he smote them with blindness according to the word of
Elisha.

<span id="an_6:19">6:19</span> And Elisha said to them, This is not the
way, neither is this the city: follow me, and I will bring you to the
man whom ye seek. But he led them to Samaria.

<span id="an_6:20">6:20</span> And it came to pass, when they had come
into Samaria, that Elisha said, LORD, open the eyes of these men, that
they may see. And the LORD opened their eyes, and they saw; and behold,
they were in the midst of Samaria.

<span id="an_6:21">6:21</span> And the king of Israel said to Elisha,
when he saw them, My father, shall I smite them? shall I smite them?

<span id="an_6:22">6:22</span> And he answered, Thou shalt not smite
them: wouldst thou smite those whom thou hast taken captive with thy
sword and with thy bow? set bread and water before them, that they may
eat and drink, and go to their master.

<span id="an_6:23">6:23</span> And he prepared great provision for them:
and when they had eaten and drank, he sent them away, and they went to
their master. So the bands of Syria came no more into the land of
Israel.

<span id="an_6:24">6:24</span> And it came to pass after this, that
Ben-hadad king of Syria gathered all his army, and went up, and besieged
Samaria.

<span id="an_6:25">6:25</span> And there was a great famine in Samaria:
and behold, they besieged it, until an ass's head was sold for eighty
pieces of silver, and the fourth part of a cab of dove's dung for five
pieces of silver.

<span id="an_6:26">6:26</span> And as the king of Israel was passing by
upon the wall, there cried a woman to him, saying, Help, my lord, O
king.

<span id="an_6:27">6:27</span> And he said, If the LORD doth not help
thee, whence shall I help thee? out of the barn-floor, or out of the
wine-press?

<span id="an_6:28">6:28</span> And the king said to her, What aileth
thee? and she answered, This woman said to me, Give thy son, that we may
eat him to-day, and we will eat my son to-morrow.

<span id="an_6:29">6:29</span> So we boiled my son, and ate him: and I
said to her on the next day, Give thy son, that we may eat him: and she
hath hid her son.

<span id="an_6:30">6:30</span> And it came to pass, when the king heard
the words of the woman, that he rent his clothes; and he passed by upon
the wall, and the people looked, and behold, he had sackcloth within
upon his flesh.

<span id="an_6:31">6:31</span> Then he said, God do so and more also to
me, if the head of Elisha the son of Shaphat shall stand on him this
day.

<span id="an_6:32">6:32</span> But Elisha sat in his house, and the
elders sat with him; and the king sent a man from before him: but ere
the messenger came to him, he said to the elders, See ye how this son of
a murderer hath sent to take away my head? look, when the messenger
cometh, shut the door, and hold him fast at the door: is not the sound
of his master's feet behind him?

<span id="an_6:33">6:33</span> And while he yet talked with them,
behold, the messenger came down to him: and he said, Behold, this evil
is from the LORD; what should I wait for the LORD any longer?

<span id="an_7:1">7:1</span> Then Elisha said, Hear ye the word of the
LORD; Thus saith the LORD, To-morrow about this time shall a measure of
fine flour be sold for a shekel, and two measures of barley for a
shekel, in the gate of Samaria.

<span id="an_7:2">7:2</span> Then a lord on whose hand the king leaned
answered the man of God, and said, Behold, if the LORD would make
windows in heaven, might this thing be? And he said, Behold, thou shalt
see it with thy eyes, but shalt not eat of it.

<span id="an_7:3">7:3</span> And there were four leprous men at the
entrance of the gate: and they said one to another, Why sit we here
until we die?

<span id="an_7:4">7:4</span> If we say, We will enter into the city,
then the famine is in the city, and we shall die there: and if we sit
still here, we die also. Now therefore come, and let us fall to the army
of the Syrians: if they save us alive, we shall live; and if they kill
us, we shall but die.

<span id="an_7:5">7:5</span> And they rose in the twilight to go to the
camp of the Syrians: and when they had come to the uttermost part of the
camp of Syria, behold, there was no man there.

<span id="an_7:6">7:6</span> For the Lord had made the army of the
Syrians to hear a noise of chariots, and a noise of horses, even the
noise of a great army: and they said one to another, Lo, the king of
Israel hath hired against us the kings of the Hittites, and the kings of
the Egyptians, to come upon us.

<span id="an_7:7">7:7</span> Wherefore they arose and fled in the
twilight, and left their tents, and their horses, and their asses, even
the camp as it was, and fled for their life.

<span id="an_7:8">7:8</span> And when these lepers came to the uttermost
part of the camp, they went into one tent, and ate and drank, and
carried thence silver, and gold, and raiment, and went and hid it; and
came again, and entered into another tent, and carried thence also, and
went and hid it.

<span id="an_7:9">7:9</span> Then they said one to another, We do not
well: this day is a day of good tidings, and we hold our peace: if we
tarry till the morning light, some mischief will come upon us: now
therefore come, that we may go and tell the king's household.

<span id="an_7:10">7:10</span> So they came and called to the porter of
the city: and they told him, saying, We came to the camp of the Syrians,
and behold, there was no man there, neither voice of man, but horses
tied, and asses tied, and the tents as they were.

<span id="an_7:11">7:11</span> And he called the porters; and they told
it to the king's house within.

<span id="an_7:12">7:12</span> And the king arose in the night, and said
to his servants, I will now show you what the Syrians have done to us.
They know that we are hungry; therefore they have gone out of the camp,
to hide themselves in the field, saying, When they come out of the city,
we shall take them alive, and get into the city.

<span id="an_7:13">7:13</span> And one of his servants answered and
said, Let some take, I pray thee, five of the horses that remain, which
are left in the city, (behold, they are as all the multitude of Israel
that are left in it: behold, I say, they are even as all the multitude
of the Israelites that are consumed:) and let us send and see.

<span id="an_7:14">7:14</span> They took therefore two chariot horses;
and the king sent after the host of the Syrians, saying, Go and see.

<span id="an_7:15">7:15</span> And they went after them to Jordan: and
lo, all the way was full of garments and vessels, which the Syrians had
cast away in their haste. And the messengers returned, and told the
king.

<span id="an_7:16">7:16</span> And the people went out, and plundered
the tents of the Syrians. So a measure of fine flour was sold for a
shekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel, according to the word
of the LORD.

<span id="an_7:17">7:17</span> And the king appointed the lord on whose
hand he leaned to have the charge of the gate: and the people trod upon
him in the gate, and he died, as the man of God had said, who spoke when
the king came down to him.

<span id="an_7:18">7:18</span> And it came to pass as the man of God had
spoken to the king, saying, Two measures of barley for a shekel, and a
measure of fine flour for a shekel, shall be to-morrow about this time
in the gate of Samaria:

<span id="an_7:19">7:19</span> And that lord answered the man of God,
and said, Now, behold, if the LORD should make windows in heaven, might
such a thing be? And he said, Behold, thou shalt see it with thy eyes,
but shalt not eat of it.

<span id="an_7:20">7:20</span> And so it happened to him: for the people
trod upon him in the gate, and he died.

<span id="an_8:1">8:1</span> Then Elisha spoke to the woman, whose son
he had restored to life, saying, Arise, and go thou and thy household,
and sojourn wherever thou canst sojourn: for the LORD hath called for a
famine; and it shall also come upon the land seven years.

<span id="an_8:2">8:2</span> And the woman arose, and did according to
the saying of the man of God: and she went with her household, and
sojourned in the land of the Philistines seven years.

<span id="an_8:3">8:3</span> And it came to pass at the seven years'
end, that the woman returned from the land of the Philistines: and she
went forth to cry to the king for her house, and for her land.

<span id="an_8:4">8:4</span> And the king talked with Gehazi the servant
of the man of God, saying, Tell me, I pray thee, all the great things
that Elisha hath done.

<span id="an_8:5">8:5</span> And it came to pass, as he was telling the
king how he had restored a dead body to life, that behold, the woman,
whose son he had restored to life, cried to the king for her house and
for her land. And Gehazi said, My lord, O king, this is the woman, and
this is her son, whom Elisha restored to life.

<span id="an_8:6">8:6</span> And when the king asked the woman, she told
him. So the king appointed to her a certain officer, saying, Restore all
that was hers, and all the fruits of the field since the day that she
left the land even till now.

<span id="an_8:7">8:7</span> And Elisha came to Damascus; and Ben-hadad
the king of Syria was sick; and it was told to him, saying, The man of
God hath come hither.

<span id="an_8:8">8:8</span> And the king said to Hazael, Take a present
in thy hand, and go, meet the man of God, and inquire of the LORD by
him, saying, Shall I recover of this disease?

<span id="an_8:9">8:9</span> So Hazael went to meet him, and took a
present with him, even of every good thing of Damascus, forty camels
burden, and came and stood before him, and said, Thy son Ben-hadad king
of Syria hath sent me to thee, saying, Shall I recover of this disease?

<span id="an_8:10">8:10</span> And Elisha said to him, Go, say to him,
Thou mayest certainly recover: but the LORD hath showed me, that he
shall surely die.

<span id="an_8:11">8:11</span> And he settled his countenance
steadfastly, until he was ashamed: and the man of God wept.

<span id="an_8:12">8:12</span> And Hazael said, Why weepeth my lord? And
he answered, Because I know the evil that thou wilt do to the children
of Israel: their strong holds wilt thou set on fire, and their young men
wilt thou slay with the sword, and wilt dash their children, and rip up
their women with child.

<span id="an_8:13">8:13</span> And Hazael said, But what, is thy servant
a dog, that he should do this great thing? And Elisha answered, The LORD
hath shown me that thou wilt be king over Syria.

<span id="an_8:14">8:14</span> So he departed from Elisha, and came to
his master; who said to him, What said Elisha to thee? And he answered,
He told me that thou shouldest surely recover.

<span id="an_8:15">8:15</span> And it came to pass on the morrow, that
he took a thick cloth, and dipped it in water, and spread it on his
face, so that he died: and Hazael reigned in his stead.

<span id="an_8:16">8:16</span> And in the fifth year of Joram the son of
Ahab king of Israel, Jehoshaphat being then king of Judah, Jehoram the
son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah began to reign.

<span id="an_8:17">8:17</span> Thirty and two years old was he when he
began to reign; and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem.

<span id="an_8:18">8:18</span> And he walked in the way of the kings of
Israel, as did the house of Ahab: for the daughter of Ahab was his wife:
and he did evil in the sight of the LORD.

<span id="an_8:19">8:19</span> Yet the LORD would not destroy Judah, for
David his servant's sake, as he promised him to give him always a light,
and to his children.

<span id="an_8:20">8:20</span> In his days Edom revolted from under the
hand of Judah, and made a king over themselves.

<span id="an_8:21">8:21</span> So Joram went over to Zair, and all the
chariots with him: and he rose by night, and smote the Edomites who
encompassed him, and the captains of the chariots: and the people fled
into their tents.

<span id="an_8:22">8:22</span> Yet Edom revolted from under the hand of
Judah to this day. Then Libnah revolted at the same time.

<span id="an_8:23">8:23</span> And the rest of the acts of Joram, and
all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of
the kings of Judah?

<span id="an_8:24">8:24</span> And Joram slept with his fathers, and was
buried with his fathers, in the city of David; and Ahaziah his son
reigned in his stead.

<span id="an_8:25">8:25</span> In the twelfth year of Joram the son of
Ahab king of Israel did Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah begin
to reign.

<span id="an_8:26">8:26</span> Two and twenty years old was Ahaziah when
he began to reign; and he reigned one year in Jerusalem. And his
mother's name was Athaliah, the daughter of Omri king of Israel.

<span id="an_8:27">8:27</span> And he walked in the way of the house of
Ahab, and did evil in the sight of the LORD, as did the house of Ahab:
for he was the son-in-law of the house of Ahab.

<span id="an_8:28">8:28</span> And he went with Joram the son of Ahab to
the war against Hazael king of Syria in Ramoth-gilead; and the Syrians
wounded Joram.

<span id="an_8:29">8:29</span> And king Joram went back to be healed in
Jezreel of the wounds which the Syrians had given him at Ramah, when he
fought against Hazael king of Syria. And Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king
of Judah went down to see Joram the son of Ahab in Jezreel, because he
was sick.

<span id="an_9:1">9:1</span> And Elisha the prophet called one of the
children of the prophets, and said to him, Gird up thy loins, and take
this box of oil in thy hand, and go to Ramoth-gilead:

<span id="an_9:2">9:2</span> And when thou comest thither, look out
there Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat, the son of Nimshi, and go in, and
make him arise up from among his brethren, and carry him to an inner
chamber;

<span id="an_9:3">9:3</span> Then take the box of oil, and pour it on
his head, and say, Thus saith the LORD, I have anointed thee king over
Israel. Then open the door, and flee, and tarry not.

<span id="an_9:4">9:4</span> So the young man, even the young man the
prophet, went to Ramoth-gilead.

<span id="an_9:5">9:5</span> And when he came, behold, the captains of
the host were sitting; and he said, I have an errand to thee, O captain.
And Jehu said, To which of us all? And he said, To thee, O captain.

<span id="an_9:6">9:6</span> And he arose, and went into the house; and
he poured the oil on his head, and said to him, Thus saith the LORD God
of Israel, I have anointed thee king over the people of the LORD, even
over Israel.

<span id="an_9:7">9:7</span> And thou shalt smite the house of Ahab thy
master, that I may avenge the blood of my servants the prophets, and the
blood of all the servants of the LORD, at the hand of Jezebel.

<span id="an_9:8">9:8</span> For the whole house of Ahab shall perish:
and I will cut off from Ahab the males, and him that is shut up and left
in Israel:

<span id="an_9:9">9:9</span> And I will make the house of Ahab like the
house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son
of Ahijah:

<span id="an_9:10">9:10</span> And the dogs shall eat Jezebel in the
portion of Jezreel, and there shall be none to bury her. And he opened
the door, and fled.

<span id="an_9:11">9:11</span> Then Jehu came forth to the servants of
his lord: and one said to him, Is all well? Why came this mad man to
thee? And he said to them, Ye know the man, and his communication.

<span id="an_9:12">9:12</span> And they said, It is false; tell us now.
And he said, Thus and thus he spoke to me, saying, Thus saith the LORD,
I have anointed thee king over Israel.

<span id="an_9:13">9:13</span> Then they hasted, and took every man his
garment, and put it under him on the top of the stairs, and blew with
trumpets, saying, Jehu is king.

<span id="an_9:14">9:14</span> So Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of
Nimshi conspired against Joram. (Now Joram had kept Ramoth-gilead, he
and all Israel, because of Hazael king of Syria.

<span id="an_9:15">9:15</span> But king Joram had returned to be healed
in Jezreel of the wounds which the Syrians had given him, when he fought
with Hazael king of Syria.) And Jehu said, If it is your minds, then let
none go forth nor escape from the city to go to tell it in Jezreel.

<span id="an_9:16">9:16</span> So Jehu rode in a chariot, and went to
Jezreel; for Joram lay there. And Ahaziah king of Judah had come down to
see Joram.

<span id="an_9:17">9:17</span> And there stood a watchman on the tower
in Jezreel, and he spied the company of Jehu as he came, and said, I see
a company. And Joram said, Take a horseman, and send to meet them, and
let him say, Is it peace?

<span id="an_9:18">9:18</span> So there went one on horseback to meet
him, and said, Thus saith the king, Is it peace? And Jehu said, What
hast thou to do with peace? turn thee behind me. And the watchman told,
saying, The messenger came to them, but he doth not return.

<span id="an_9:19">9:19</span> Then he sent out a second on horseback,
who came to them, and said, Thus saith the king, Is it peace? And Jehu
answered, What hast thou to do with peace? turn thee behind me.

<span id="an_9:20">9:20</span> And the watchman told, saying, He came
even to them, and doth not return? and the driving is like the driving
of Jehu the son of Nimshi; for he driveth furiously.

<span id="an_9:21">9:21</span> And Joram said, Make ready. And his
chariot was made ready. And Joram king of Israel and Ahaziah king of
Judah went out, each in his chariot, and they went out against Jehu, and
met him in the portion of Naboth the Jezreelite.

<span id="an_9:22">9:22</span> And it came to pass, when Joram saw Jehu,
that he said, Is it peace, Jehu? And he answered, What peace, so long as
the lewd acts of thy mother Jezebel and her witchcrafts are so many?

<span id="an_9:23">9:23</span> And Joram turned his hands, and fled, and
said to Ahaziah, There is treachery, O Ahaziah.

<span id="an_9:24">9:24</span> And Jehu drew a bow with his full
strength, and smote Jehoram between his arms, and the arrow went out at
his heart, and he sunk down in his chariot.

<span id="an_9:25">9:25</span> Then said Jehu to Bidkar his captain,
Take up, and cast him into the portion of the field of Naboth the
Jezreelite; for remember how that, when I and thou rode together after
Ahab his father, the LORD laid this burden upon him;

<span id="an_9:26">9:26</span> Surely I saw yesterday the blood of
Naboth, and the blood of his sons, saith the LORD; and I will requite
thee in this plat, saith the LORD. Now therefore take and cast him into
the plat of ground, according to the word of the LORD.

<span id="an_9:27">9:27</span> But when Ahaziah the king of Judah saw
this, he fled by the way of the garden house. And Jehu followed him, and
said, Smite him also in the chariot. And they did so at the going up to
Gur, which is by Ibleam. And he fled to Megiddo, and died there.

<span id="an_9:28">9:28</span> And his servants carried him in a chariot
to Jerusalem, and buried him in his sepulcher with his fathers in the
city of David.

<span id="an_9:29">9:29</span> And in the eleventh year of Joram the son
of Ahab began Ahaziah to reign over Judah.

<span id="an_9:30">9:30</span> And when Jehu had come to Jezreel,
Jezebel heard of it; and she painted her face, and adorned her head, and
looked out at a window.

<span id="an_9:31">9:31</span> And as Jehu entered the gate, she said,
Had Zimri peace, who slew his master?

<span id="an_9:32">9:32</span> And he lifted up his face to the window,
and said, Who is on my side? who? And there looked out to him two or
three eunuchs.

<span id="an_9:33">9:33</span> And he said, Throw her down. So they
threw her down: and some of her blood was sprinkled on the wall, and on
the horses: and he trod her under foot.

<span id="an_9:34">9:34</span> And when he had come in, he ate, and
drank, and said, Go, see now this cursed woman, and bury her: for she is
a king's daughter.

<span id="an_9:35">9:35</span> And they went to bury her: but they found
no more of her than the skull, and the feet, and the palms of her hands.

<span id="an_9:36">9:36</span> Wherefore they came again, and told him.
And he said, This is the word of the LORD, which he spoke by his servant
Elijah the Tishbite, saying, In the portion of Jezreel shall dogs eat
the flesh of Jezebel:

<span id="an_9:37">9:37</span> And the carcass of Jezebel shall be as
dung upon the face of the field in the portion of Jezreel; so that they
shall not say, This is Jezebel.

<span id="an_10:1">10:1</span> And Ahab had seventy sons in Samaria. And
Jehu wrote letters, and sent to Samaria, to the rulers of Jezreel, to
the elders, and to them that brought up Ahab's children, saying,

<span id="an_10:2">10:2</span> Now as soon as this letter cometh to you,
seeing your master's sons are with you, and there are with you chariots
and horses, a fortified city also, and armor;

<span id="an_10:3">10:3</span> Look out the best and meetest of your
master's sons, and set him on his father's throne, and fight for your
master's house.

<span id="an_10:4">10:4</span> But they were exceedingly afraid, and
said, Behold, two kings stood not before him: how then shall we stand?

<span id="an_10:5">10:5</span> And he that was over the house, and he
that was over the city, the elders also, and those who brought up the
children, sent to Jehu, saying, We are thy servants, and will do all
that thou shalt bid us; we will not make any king: do thou that which is
good in thy eyes.

<span id="an_10:6">10:6</span> Then he wrote a letter the second time to
them, saying, if ye are mine, and if ye will hearken to my voice, take
ye the heads of the men your master's sons, and come to me to Jezreel by
to-morrow this time. Now the king's sons being seventy persons, were
with the great men of the city, who brought them up.

<span id="an_10:7">10:7</span> And it came to pass, when the letter came
to them, that they took the king's sons, and slew seventy persons, and
put their heads in baskets, and sent them to him to Jezreel.

<span id="an_10:8">10:8</span> And there came a messenger, and told him,
saying, They have brought the heads of the king's sons. And he said, Lay
ye them in two heaps at the entrance of the gate until the morning.

<span id="an_10:9">10:9</span> And it came to pass in the morning, that
he went out, and stood, and said to all the people, Ye are righteous:
behold, I conspired against my master, and slew him: but who slew all
these?

<span id="an_10:10">10:10</span> Know now that there shall fall to the
earth nothing of the word of the LORD, which the LORD spoke concerning
the house of Ahab; for the LORD hath done that which he spoke by his
servant Elijah.

<span id="an_10:11">10:11</span> So Jehu slew all that remained of the
house of Ahab in Jezreel, and all his great men, and his kinsmen, and
his priests, until he left him none remaining.

<span id="an_10:12">10:12</span> And he arose and departed, and came to
Samaria. And as he was at the shearing-house in the way,

<span id="an_10:13">10:13</span> Jehu met with the brethren of Ahaziah
king of Judah, and said, Who are ye? And they answered, We are the
brethren of Ahaziah; and we go down to salute the children of the king
and the children of the queen.

<span id="an_10:14">10:14</span> And he said, Take them alive. And they
took them alive, and slew them at the pit of the shearing-house, even
two and forty men; neither left he any of them.

<span id="an_10:15">10:15</span> And when he had departed thence, he
lighted on Jehonadab the son of Rechab coming to meet him: and he
saluted him, and said to him, Is thy heart right, as my heart is with
thy heart; And Jehonadab answered, It is. If it is, give me thy hand.
And he gave him his hand; and he took him up to him into the chariot.

<span id="an_10:16">10:16</span> And he said, Come with me, and see my
zeal for the LORD. So they made him ride in his chariot.

<span id="an_10:17">10:17</span> And when he came to Samaria, he slew
all that remained to Ahab in Samaria, till he had destroyed him,
according to the saying of the LORD, which he spoke to Elijah.

<span id="an_10:18">10:18</span> And Jehu convened all the people, and
said to them, Ahab served Baal a little; but Jehu shall serve him much.

<span id="an_10:19">10:19</span> Now therefore call to me all the
prophets of Baal, all his servants, and all his priests; let none be
wanting: for I have a great sacrifice to do to Baal: whoever shall be
wanting, he shall not live. But Jehu did it in subtilty, to the intent
that he might destroy the worshipers of Baal.

<span id="an_10:20">10:20</span> And Jehu said, Proclaim a solemn
assembly for Baal. And they proclaimed it.

<span id="an_10:21">10:21</span> And Jehu sent through all Israel: and
all the worshipers of Baal came, so that there was not a man left that
came not. And they came into the house of Baal; and the house of Baal
was full from one end to another.

<span id="an_10:22">10:22</span> And he said to him that was over the
vestry, Bring forth vestments for all the worshipers of Baal. And he
brought them forth vestments.

<span id="an_10:23">10:23</span> And Jehu went, and Jehonadab the son of
Rechab, into the house of Baal, and said to the worshipers of Baal,
Search, and look that there are here with you none of the servants of
the LORD, but the worshipers of Baal only.

<span id="an_10:24">10:24</span> And when they went in to offer
sacrifices and burnt-offerings, Jehu appointed eighty men without, and
said, If any of the men whom I have brought into your hands escape, he
that letteth him go, his life shall be for the life of him.

<span id="an_10:25">10:25</span> And it came to pass, as soon as he had
made an end of offering the burnt-offering, that Jehu said to the guard
and to the captains, Go in, and slay them; let none come forth. And they
smote them with the edge of the sword; and the guard and the captains
cast them out, and went to the city of the house of Baal.

<span id="an_10:26">10:26</span> And they brought forth the images out
of the house of Baal, and burned them.

<span id="an_10:27">10:27</span> And they broke down the image of Baal,
and broke down the house of Baal, and made it a draught-house to this
day.

<span id="an_10:28">10:28</span> Thus Jehu destroyed Baal out of Israel.

<span id="an_10:29">10:29</span> Yet from the sins of Jeroboam the son
of Nebat, who made Israel to sin, Jehu departed not from after them, to
wit, the golden calves that were in Beth-el, and that were in Dan.

<span id="an_10:30">10:30</span> And the LORD said to Jehu, Because thou
hast done well in executing that which is right in my eyes, and hast
done to the house of Ahab according to all that was in my heart, thy
children of the fourth generation shall sit on the throne of Israel.

<span id="an_10:31">10:31</span> But Jehu took no heed to walk in the
law of the LORD God of Israel with all his heart: for he departed not
from the sins of Jeroboam, who made Israel to sin.

<span id="an_10:32">10:32</span> In those days the LORD began to cut
Israel short: and Hazael smote them in all the borders of Israel;

<span id="an_10:33">10:33</span> From Jordan eastward, all the land of
Gilead, the Gadites, and the Reubenites, and the Manassites, from Aroer,
which is by the river Arnon, even Gilead and Bashan.

<span id="an_10:34">10:34</span> Now the rest of the acts of Jehu, and
all that he did, and all his might, are they not written in the book of
the chronicles of the kings of Israel?

<span id="an_10:35">10:35</span> And Jehu slept with his fathers: and
they buried him in Samaria. And Jehoahaz his son reigned in his stead.

<span id="an_10:36">10:36</span> And the time that Jehu reigned over
Israel in Samaria was twenty and eight years.

<span id="an_11:1">11:1</span> And when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah
saw that her son was dead, she arose and destroyed all the seed royal.

<span id="an_11:2">11:2</span> But Jehosheba, the daughter of king
Joram, sister of Ahaziah, took Joash the the son of Ahaziah, and stole
him from among the king's sons who were slain; and they hid him, even
him and his nurse, in the bed-chamber, from Athaliah, so that he was not
slain.

<span id="an_11:3">11:3</span> And he was with her hid in the house of
the LORD six years. And Athaliah reigned over the land.

<span id="an_11:4">11:4</span> And in the seventh year Jehoiada sent and
took the rulers over hundreds, with the captains and the guard, and
brought them to him into the house of the LORD, and made a covenant with
them, and took an oath of them in the house of the LORD, and showed them
the king's son.

<span id="an_11:5">11:5</span> And he commanded them, saying, This is
the thing that ye shall do; A third part of you that enter in on the
sabbath shall even be keepers of the watch of the king's house;

<span id="an_11:6">11:6</span> And a third part shall be at the gate of
Sur; and a third part at the gate behind the guard: so shall ye keep the
watch of the house, that it be not broken down.

<span id="an_11:7">11:7</span> And two parts of all you that go forth on
the sabbath, even they shall keep the watch of the house of the LORD
about the king.

<span id="an_11:8">11:8</span> And ye shall compass the king around,
every man with his weapons in his hand: and he that cometh within the
ranges, let him be slain. And be ye with the king as he goeth out and as
he cometh in.

<span id="an_11:9">11:9</span> And the captains over the hundreds did
according to all things that Jehoiada the priest commanded: and they
took every man his men that were to come in on the sabbath, with them
that should go out on the sabbath, and came to Jehoiada the priest.

<span id="an_11:10">11:10</span> And to the captains over hundreds the
priest gave king David's spears and shields, that were in the temple of
the LORD.

<span id="an_11:11">11:11</span> And the guard stood, every man with his
weapons in his hand, around the king, from the right corner of the
temple to the left corner of the temple, along by the altar and the
temple.

<span id="an_11:12">11:12</span> And he brought forth the king's son,
and put the crown upon him, and gave him the testimony; and they made
him king, and anointed him; and they clapped their hands, and said, God
save the king.

<span id="an_11:13">11:13</span> And when Athaliah heard the noise of
the guard and of the people, she came to the people into the temple of
the LORD.

<span id="an_11:14">11:14</span> And when she looked, behold, the king
stood by a pillar, as the manner was, and the princes and the trumpeters
by the king, and all the people of the land rejoiced, and blew with
trumpets. And Athaliah rent her clothes, and cried, Treason, treason.

<span id="an_11:15">11:15</span> But Jehoiada the priest commanded the
captains of the hundreds, the officers of the host, and said to them,
Have her forth without the ranges: and him that followeth her kill with
the sword. For the priest had said, Let her not be slain in the house of
the LORD.

<span id="an_11:16">11:16</span> And they laid hands on her; and she
went by the way by which the horses came into the king's house: and
there was she slain.

<span id="an_11:17">11:17</span> And Jehoiada made a covenant between
the LORD and the king and the people, that they should be the LORD'S
people; between the king also and the people.

<span id="an_11:18">11:18</span> And all the people of the land went
into the house of Baal, and broke it down; his altars and his images
they broke wholly in pieces, and slew Mattan the priest of Baal before
the altars. And the priest appointed officers over the the house of the
LORD.

<span id="an_11:19">11:19</span> And he took the rulers over hundreds,
and the captains, and the guard, and all the people of the land; and
they brought down the king from the house of the LORD, and came by the
way of the gate of the guard to the king's house. And he sat on the
throne of the kings.

<span id="an_11:20">11:20</span> And all the people of the land
rejoiced, and the city was in quiet: and they slew Athaliah with the
sword beside the king's house.

<span id="an_11:21">11:21</span> Seven years old was Jehoash when he
began to reign.

<span id="an_12:1">12:1</span> In the seventh year of Jehu, Jehoash
began to reign; and forty years reigned he in Jerusalem. And his
mother's name was Zibiah of Beer-sheba.

<span id="an_12:2">12:2</span> And Jehoash did that which was right in
the sight of the LORD all his days wherein Jehoiada the priest
instructed him.

<span id="an_12:3">12:3</span> But the high places were not taken away:
the people still sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places.

<span id="an_12:4">12:4</span> And Jehoash said to the priests, All the
money of the dedicated things that is brought into the house of the
LORD, even the money of every one that passeth the account, the money
that every man is set at, and all the money that cometh into any man's
heart to bring into the house of the LORD,

<span id="an_12:5">12:5</span> Let the priests take it to them, every
man of his acquaintance: and let them repair the breaches of the house,
wherever any breach shall be found.

<span id="an_12:6">12:6</span> But it was so, that in the three and
twentieth year of king Jehoash the priests had not repaired the breaches
of the house.

<span id="an_12:7">12:7</span> Then king Jehoash called for Jehoiada the
priest, and the other priests, and said to them, Why repair ye not the
breaches of the house? now therefore receive no more money of your
acquaintance, but deliver it for the breaches of the house.

<span id="an_12:8">12:8</span> And the priests consented to receive no
more money of the people, neither to repair the breaches of the house.

<span id="an_12:9">12:9</span> But Jehoiada the priest took a chest, and
bored a hole in the lid of it, and set it beside the altar, on the right
side as one cometh into the house of the LORD: and the priests that kept
the door put in it all the money that was brought into the house of the
LORD.

<span id="an_12:10">12:10</span> And it was so, when they saw that there
was much money in the chest, that the king's scribe and the high priest
came up, and they put up in bags, and counted the money that was found
in the house of the LORD.

<span id="an_12:11">12:11</span> And they gave the money, being counted,
into the hands of them that did the work, that had the oversight of the
house of the LORD: and they laid it out to the carpenters and builders,
that wrought upon the house of the LORD,

<span id="an_12:12">12:12</span> And to masons, and hewers of stone, and
to buy timber and hewed stone to repair the breaches of the house of the
LORD, and for all that was laid out for the house to repair it.

<span id="an_12:13">12:13</span> Yet, there were not made for the house
of the LORD bowls of silver, snuffers, basons, trumpets, any vessels of
gold, or vessels of silver, of the money that was brought into the house
of the LORD:

<span id="an_12:14">12:14</span> But they gave that to the workmen, and
repaired with it the house of the LORD.

<span id="an_12:15">12:15</span> Moreover, they reckoned not with the
men, into whose hand they delivered the money to be bestowed on workmen:
for they dealt faithfully.

<span id="an_12:16">12:16</span> The trespass-money and sin-money was
not brought into the house of the LORD: it was the priests'.

<span id="an_12:17">12:17</span> Then Hazael king of Syria went up, and
fought against Gath, and took it; and Hazael set his face to go up to
Jerusalem.

<span id="an_12:18">12:18</span> And Jehoash king of Judah took all the
hallowed things that Jehoshaphat, and Jehoram, and Ahaziah, his fathers,
kings of Judah, had dedicated, and his own hallowed things, and all the
gold that was found in the treasures of the house of the LORD, and in
the king's house, and sent it to Hazael king of Syria: and he went away
from Jerusalem.

<span id="an_12:19">12:19</span> And the rest of the acts of Joash, and
all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of
the kings of Judah?

<span id="an_12:20">12:20</span> And his servants arose, and made a
conspiracy, and slew Joash in the house of Millo, which goeth down to
Silla.

<span id="an_12:21">12:21</span> For Jozachar the son of Shimeath, and
Jehozabad the son of Shomer, his servants, smote him, and he died; and
they buried him with his fathers in the city of David: And Amaziah his
son reigned in his stead.

<span id="an_13:1">13:1</span> In the three and twentieth year of Joash
the son of Ahaziah king of Judah, Jehoahaz the son of Jehu began to
reign over Israel in Samaria, and reigned seventeen years.

<span id="an_13:2">13:2</span> And he did that which was evil in the
sight of the LORD, and followed the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat,
who made Israel to sin; he departed not therefrom.

<span id="an_13:3">13:3</span> And the anger of the LORD was kindled
against Israel, and he delivered them into the hand of Hazael king of
Syria, and into the hand of Ben-hadad the son of Hazael, all their days.

<span id="an_13:4">13:4</span> And Jehoahaz besought the LORD, and the
LORD hearkened to him: for he saw the oppression of Israel, because the
king of Syria oppressed them.

<span id="an_13:5">13:5</span> (And the LORD gave Israel a savior, so
that they went out from under the hand of the Syrians: and the children
of Israel dwelt in their tents, as formerly.

<span id="an_13:6">13:6</span> Nevertheless they departed not from the
sins of the house of Jeroboam, who made Israel sin, but walked in them:
and there remained the grove also in Samaria.)

<span id="an_13:7">13:7</span> Neither did he leave of the people to
Jehoahaz but fifty horsemen, and ten chariots, and ten thousand footmen;
for the king of Syria had destroyed them, and had made them like the
dust by threshing.

<span id="an_13:8">13:8</span> Now the rest of the acts of Jehoahaz, and
all that he did, and his might, are they not written in the book of the
chronicles of the kings of Israel?

<span id="an_13:9">13:9</span> And Jehoahaz slept with his fathers; and
they buried him in Samaria: and Joash his son reigned in his stead.

<span id="an_13:10">13:10</span> In the thirty and seventh year of Joash
king of Judah began Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz to reign over Israel in
Samaria, and he reigned sixteen years.

<span id="an_13:11">13:11</span> And he did that which was evil in the
sight of the LORD: he departed not from all the sins of Jeroboam the son
of Nebat, who made Israel sin: but he walked in them.

<span id="an_13:12">13:12</span> And the rest of the acts of Joash, and
all that he did, and his might with which he fought against Amaziah king
of Judah, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the
kings of Israel?

<span id="an_13:13">13:13</span> And Joash slept with his fathers; and
Jeroboam sat upon his throne: and Joash was buried in Samaria with the
kings of Israel.

<span id="an_13:14">13:14</span> Now Elisha had fallen sick of his
disease of which he died. And Joash the king of Israel came down to him,
and wept over his face, and said, O my father, my father, the chariot of
Israel, and the horsemen thereof.

<span id="an_13:15">13:15</span> And Elisha said to him, Take bow and
arrows. And he took to him bow and arrows.

<span id="an_13:16">13:16</span> And he said to the king of Israel, Put
thy hand upon the bow. And he put his hand upon it: and Elisha put his
hands upon the king's hands.

<span id="an_13:17">13:17</span> And he said, Open the window eastward.
And he opened it. Then Elisha said, Shoot. And he shot. And he said, The
arrow of the LORD'S deliverance, and the arrow of deliverance from
Syria: for thou shalt smite the Syrians in Aphek, till thou hast
consumed them.

<span id="an_13:18">13:18</span> And he said, Take the arrows. And he
took them. And he said to the king of Israel, Smite upon the ground. And
he smote thrice, and ceased.

<span id="an_13:19">13:19</span> And the man of God was wroth with him,
and said, Thou shouldst have smitten five or six times; then hadst thou
smitten Syria till thou hadst consumed it: whereas now thou shalt smite
Syria but thrice.

<span id="an_13:20">13:20</span> And Elisha died, and they buried him.
And the bands of the Moabites invaded the land at the coming in of the
year.

<span id="an_13:21">13:21</span> And it came to pass, as they were
burying a man, that behold, they spied a band of men; and they cast the
man into the sepulcher of Elisha: and when the man was let down, and
touched the bones of Elisha, he revived, and stood on his feet.

<span id="an_13:22">13:22</span> But Hazael king of Syria oppressed
Israel all the days of Jehoahaz.

<span id="an_13:23">13:23</span> And the LORD was gracious to them, and
had compassion on them, and had respect to them, because of his covenant
with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and would not destroy them, neither did
he as yet reject them from his presence.

<span id="an_13:24">13:24</span> So Hazael king of Syria died; and
Ben-hadad his son reigned in his stead.

<span id="an_13:25">13:25</span> And Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz took
again from the hand of Ben-hadad the son of Hazael the cities, which he
had taken from the hand of Jehoahaz his father by war. Three times Joash
defeated him, and recovered the cities of Israel.

<span id="an_14:1">14:1</span> In the second year of Joash son of
Jehoahaz king of Israel, reigned Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah.

<span id="an_14:2">14:2</span> He was twenty and five years old when he
began to reign, and he reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem. And
his mother's name was Jehoaddan of Jerusalem.

<span id="an_14:3">14:3</span> And he did that which was right in the
sight of the LORD, yet not like David his father: he did according to
all things as Joash his father did.

<span id="an_14:4">14:4</span> But, the high places were not taken away:
as yet the people sacrificed, and burnt incense on the high places.

<span id="an_14:5">14:5</span> And it came to pass, as soon as the
kingdom was confirmed in his hand, that he slew his servants who had
slain the king his father.

<span id="an_14:6">14:6</span> But the children of the murderers he slew
not: according to that which is written in the book of the law of Moses,
in which the LORD commanded, saying, The fathers shall not be put to
death for the children, nor the children be put to death for the
fathers; but every man shall be put to death for his own sin.

<span id="an_14:7">14:7</span> He slew of Edom in the valley of Salt ten
thousand, and took Selah by war, and called the name of it Joktheel to
this day.

<span id="an_14:8">14:8</span> Then Amaziah sent messengers to Jehoash
the son of Jehoahaz son of Jehu king of Israel, saying, Come, let us
look one another in the face.

<span id="an_14:9">14:9</span> And Jehoash the king of Israel sent to
Amaziah king of Judah, saying, The thistle that was in Lebanon sent to
the cedar that was in Lebanon, saying, Give thy daughter to my son for a
wife: and there passed by a wild beast that was in Lebanon, and trod
down the thistle.

<span id="an_14:10">14:10</span> Thou hast indeed smitten Edom, and thy
heart hath lifted thee up: glory of this, and tarry at home: for why
shouldst thou meddle to thy hurt, that thou shouldst fall, even thou,
and Judah with thee?

<span id="an_14:11">14:11</span> But Amaziah would not hear. Therefore
Jehoash king of Israel went up: and he and Amaziah king of Judah looked
one another in the face at Beth-shemesh, which belongeth to Judah.

<span id="an_14:12">14:12</span> And Judah was defeated before Israel;
and they fled every man to their tents.

<span id="an_14:13">14:13</span> And Jehoash king of Israel took Amaziah
king of Judah, the son of Jehoash the son of Ahaziah, at Beth-shemesh,
and came to Jerusalem, and broke down the wall of Jerusalem from the
gate of Ephraim to the corner gate, four hundred cubits.

<span id="an_14:14">14:14</span> And he took all the gold and silver,
and all the vessels found in the house of the LORD, and in the treasures
of the king's house, and hostages, and returned to Samaria.

<span id="an_14:15">14:15</span> Now the rest of the acts of Jehoash
which he did, and his might, and how he fought with Amaziah king of
Judah, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings
of Israel?

<span id="an_14:16">14:16</span> And Jehoash slept with his fathers, and
was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel; and Jeroboam his son
reigned in his stead.

<span id="an_14:17">14:17</span> And Amaziah the son of Joash king of
Judah lived after the death of Jehoash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel
fifteen years.

<span id="an_14:18">14:18</span> And the rest of the acts of Amaziah,
are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of
Judah?

<span id="an_14:19">14:19</span> Now they made a conspiracy against him
in Jerusalem: and he fled to Lachish; but they sent after him to
Lachish, and slew him there.

<span id="an_14:20">14:20</span> And they brought him on horses: and he
was buried at Jerusalem with his fathers in the city of David.

<span id="an_14:21">14:21</span> And all the people of Judah took
Azariah, who was sixteen years old, and made him king instead of his
father Amaziah.

<span id="an_14:22">14:22</span> He built Elath, and restored it to
Judah, after that the king slept with his fathers.

<span id="an_14:23">14:23</span> In the fifteenth year of Amaziah the
son of Joash king of Judah, Jeroboam the son of Joash king of Israel,
began to reign in Samaria, and reigned forty and one years.

<span id="an_14:24">14:24</span> And he did that which was evil in the
sight of the LORD: he departed not from all the sins of Jeroboam the son
of Nebat, who made Israel to sin.

<span id="an_14:25">14:25</span> He restored the border of Israel from
the entering of Hamath to the sea of the plain, according to the word of
the LORD God of Israel, which he spoke by the hand of his servant Jonah,
the son of Amittai, the prophet, who was of Gath-hepher.

<span id="an_14:26">14:26</span> For the LORD saw the affliction of
Israel, that it was very bitter: for there was not any shut up, nor any
left, nor any helper for Israel.

<span id="an_14:27">14:27</span> And the LORD said not that he would
blot out the name of Israel from under heaven: but he saved them by the
hand of Jeroboam the son of Joash.

<span id="an_14:28">14:28</span> Now the rest of the acts of Jeroboam,
and all that he did, and his might, how he warred, and how he recovered
Damascus, and Hamath, which belonged to Judah, for Israel, are they not
written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?

<span id="an_14:29">14:29</span> And Jeroboam slept with his fathers,
even with the kings of Israel; and Zachariah his son reigned in his
stead.

<span id="an_15:1">15:1</span> In the twenty and seventh year of
Jeroboam king of Israel began Azariah son of Amaziah king of Judah to
reign.

<span id="an_15:2">15:2</span> Sixteen years old was he when he began to
reign, and he reigned two and fifty years in Jerusalem. And his mother's
name was Jecholiah of Jerusalem.

<span id="an_15:3">15:3</span> And he did that which was right in the
sight of the LORD, according to all that his father Amaziah had done;

<span id="an_15:4">15:4</span> Save that the high places were not
removed: the people sacrificed and burnt incense still on the high
places.

<span id="an_15:5">15:5</span> And the LORD smote the king, so that he
was a leper to the day of his death, and dwelt in a separate house. And
Jotham the king's son was over the house, judging the people of the
land.

<span id="an_15:6">15:6</span> And the rest of the acts of Azariah, and
all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of
the kings of Judah?

<span id="an_15:7">15:7</span> So Azariah slept with his fathers; and
they buried him with his fathers in the city of David: and Jotham his
son reigned in his stead.

<span id="an_15:8">15:8</span> In the thirty and eighth year of Azariah
king of Judah did Zachariah the son of Jeroboam reign over Israel in
Samaria six months.

<span id="an_15:9">15:9</span> And he did that which was evil in the
sight of the LORD, as his fathers had done: he departed not from the
sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin.

<span id="an_15:10">15:10</span> And Shallum the son of Jabesh conspired
against him, and smote him before the people, and slew him, and reigned
in his stead.

<span id="an_15:11">15:11</span> And the rest of the acts of Zachariah,
behold they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of
Israel.

<span id="an_15:12">15:12</span> This was the word of the LORD which he
spoke to Jehu, saying, Thy sons shall sit on the throne of Israel to the
fourth generation. And so it came to pass.

<span id="an_15:13">15:13</span> Shallum the son of Jabesh began to
reign in the nine and thirtieth year of Uzziah king of Judah; and he
reigned a full month in Samaria.

<span id="an_15:14">15:14</span> For Menahem the son of Gadi went up
from Tirzah, and came to Samaria, and smote Shallum the son of Jabesh in
Samaria, and slew him, and reigned in his stead.

<span id="an_15:15">15:15</span> And the rest of the acts of Shallum,
and his conspiracy which he made, behold, they are written in the book
of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.

<span id="an_15:16">15:16</span> Then Menahem smote Tiphsah, and all
that were in it, and the borders of it from Tirzah: because they opened
not to him, therefore he smote it; and all the women in it that were
with child he ripped up.

<span id="an_15:17">15:17</span> In the nine and thirtieth year of
Azariah king of Judah began Menahem the son of Gadi to reign over
Israel, and reigned ten years in Samaria.

<span id="an_15:18">15:18</span> And he did that which was evil in the
sight of the LORD: he departed not all his days from the sins of
Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin.

<span id="an_15:19">15:19</span> And Pul the king of Assyria came
against the land: and Menahem gave Pul a thousand talents of silver,
that his hand might be with him to confirm the kingdom in his hand.

<span id="an_15:20">15:20</span> And Menahem exacted the money of
Israel, even of all the mighty men of wealth, of each man fifty shekels
of silver, to give to the king of Assyria. So the king of Assyria turned
back, and stayed not there in the land.

<span id="an_15:21">15:21</span> And the rest of the acts of Menahem,
and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles
of the kings of Israel?

<span id="an_15:22">15:22</span> And Menahem slept with his fathers; and
Pekahiah his son reigned in his stead.

<span id="an_15:23">15:23</span> In the fiftieth year of Azariah king of
Judah, Pekahiah the son of Menahem began to reign over Israel in
Samaria, and reigned two years.

<span id="an_15:24">15:24</span> And he did that which was evil in the
sight of the LORD: he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam the son of
Nebat, who made Israel to sin.

<span id="an_15:25">15:25</span> But Pekah the son of Remaliah, a
captain of his, conspired against him, and smote him in Samaria, in the
palace of the king's house, with Argob and Arieh, and with him fifty men
of the Gileadites: and he killed him, and reigned in his room.

<span id="an_15:26">15:26</span> And the rest of the acts of Pekahiah,
and all that he did, behold, they are written in the book of the
chronicles of the kings of Israel.

<span id="an_15:27">15:27</span> In the two and fiftieth year of Azariah
king of Judah, Pekah the son of Remaliah began to reign over Israel in
Samaria, and reigned twenty years.

<span id="an_15:28">15:28</span> And he did that which was evil in the
sight of the LORD: he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam the son of
Nebat, who made Israel to sin.

<span id="an_15:29">15:29</span> In the days of Pekah king of Israel
came Tiglath-pileser king of Assyria, and took Ijon, and
Abel-beth-maachah, and Janoah, and Kedesh, and Hazor, and Gilead, and
Galilee, all the land of Naphtali, and carried them captive to Assyria.

<span id="an_15:30">15:30</span> And Hoshea the son of Elah made a
conspiracy against Pekah the son of Remaliah, and smote him, and slew
him, and reigned in his stead, in the twentieth year of Jotham the son
of Uzziah.

<span id="an_15:31">15:31</span> And the rest of the acts of Pekah, and
all that he did, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles
of the kings of Israel.

<span id="an_15:32">15:32</span> In the second year of Pekah the son of
Remaliah king of Israel, began Jotham the son of Uzziah king of Judah to
reign.

<span id="an_15:33">15:33</span> Five and twenty years old was he when
he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. And his
mother's name was Jerusha, the daughter of Zadok.

<span id="an_15:34">15:34</span> And he did that which was right in the
sight of the LORD: he did according to all that his father Uzziah had
done.

<span id="an_15:35">15:35</span> Yet, the high places were not removed:
the people sacrificed and burned incense still in the high places. He
built the higher gate of the house of the LORD.

<span id="an_15:36">15:36</span> Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, and
all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of
the kings of Judah?

<span id="an_15:37">15:37</span> In those days the LORD began to send
against Judah, Rezin the king of Syria, and Pekah the son of Remaliah.

<span id="an_15:38">15:38</span> And Jotham slept with his fathers, and
was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father: And Ahaz
his son reigned in his stead.

<span id="an_16:1">16:1</span> In the seventeenth year of Pekah the son
of Remaliah Ahaz the son of Jotham king of Judah began to reign.

<span id="an_16:2">16:2</span> Twenty years old was Ahaz when he began
to reign, and reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem, and did not that which
was right in the sight of the LORD his God, like David his father.

<span id="an_16:3">16:3</span> But he walked in the way of the kings of
Israel, and even made his son to pass through the fire, according to the
abominations of the heathen, whom the LORD cast out from before the
children of Israel.

<span id="an_16:4">16:4</span> And he sacrificed and burnt incense in
the high places, and on the hills, and under every green tree.

<span id="an_16:5">16:5</span> Then Rezin king of Syria and Pekah son of
Remaliah king of Israel came up to Jerusalem to war: and they besieged
Ahaz, but could not overcome him.

<span id="an_16:6">16:6</span> At that time Rezin king of Syria
recovered Elath to Syria, and drove the Jews from Elath: and the Syrians
came to Elath, and have dwelt there to this day.

<span id="an_16:7">16:7</span> So Ahaz sent messengers to
Tiglath-pileser king of Assyria, saying, I am thy servant and thy son:
come up, and save me from the hand of the king of Syria, and from the
hand of the king of Israel, who rise up against me.

<span id="an_16:8">16:8</span> And Ahaz took the silver and gold that
was found in the house of the LORD, and in the treasures of the king's
house, and sent it for a present to the king of Assyria.

<span id="an_16:9">16:9</span> And the king of Assyria hearkened to him:
for the king of Assyria went up against Damascus, and took it, and
carried the people of it captive to Kir, and slew Rezin.

<span id="an_16:10">16:10</span> And king Ahaz went to Damascus to meet
Tiglath-pileser king of Assyria, and saw an altar that was at Damascus:
and king Ahaz sent to Urijah the priest the fashion of the altar, and
the pattern of it, according to all the workmanship of it.

<span id="an_16:11">16:11</span> And Urijah the priest built an altar
according to all that king Ahaz had sent from Damascus: so Urijah the
priest made it against king Ahaz came from Damascus.

<span id="an_16:12">16:12</span> And when the king had come from
Damascus, the king saw the altar: and the king approached to the altar,
and offered on it.

<span id="an_16:13">16:13</span> And he burnt his burnt-offering and his
meat-offering, and poured his drink-offering, and sprinkled the blood of
his peace-offerings upon the altar.

<span id="an_16:14">16:14</span> And he brought also the brazen altar,
which was before the LORD, from the front of the house, from between the
altar and the house of the LORD, and put it on the north side of the
altar.

<span id="an_16:15">16:15</span> And king Ahaz commanded Urijah the
priest, saying, Upon the great altar burn the morning burnt-offering,
and the evening meat-offering, and the king's burnt-sacrifice, and his
meat-offering, with the burnt-offering of all the people of the land,
and their meat-offering, and their drink-offerings; and sprinkle upon it
all the blood of the burnt-offering, and all the blood of the sacrifice:
and the brazen altar shall be for me to inquire by.

<span id="an_16:16">16:16</span> Thus did Urijah the priest, according
to all that king Ahaz commanded.

<span id="an_16:17">16:17</span> And king Ahaz cut off the borders of
the bases, and removed the laver from off them; and took down the sea
from off the brazen oxen that were under it, and put it upon a pavement
of stones.

<span id="an_16:18">16:18</span> And the covert for the sabbath that
they had built in the house, and the king's entry without, he turned
from the house of the LORD for the king of Assyria.

<span id="an_16:19">16:19</span> Now the rest of the acts of Ahaz which
he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings
of Judah?

<span id="an_16:20">16:20</span> And Ahaz slept with his fathers, and
was buried with his fathers in the city of David: and Hezekiah his son
reigned in his stead.

<span id="an_17:1">17:1</span> In the twelfth year of Ahaz king of Judah
began Hoshea the son of Elah to reign in Samaria over Israel nine years.

<span id="an_17:2">17:2</span> And he did that which was evil in the
sight of the LORD, but not as the kings of Israel that were before him.

<span id="an_17:3">17:3</span> Against him came up Shalmaneser king of
Assyria; and Hoshea became his servant, and gave him presents.

<span id="an_17:4">17:4</span> And the king of Assyria found conspiracy
in Hoshea: for he had sent messengers to So king of Egypt, and brought
no present to the king of Assyria, as he had done year by year:
therefore the king of Assyria shut him up, and bound him in prison.

<span id="an_17:5">17:5</span> Then the king of Assyria came up
throughout all the land, and went up to Samaria, and besieged it three
years.

<span id="an_17:6">17:6</span> In the ninth year of Hoshea, the king of
Assyria took Samaria, and carried Israel away into Assyria, and placed
them in Halah and in Habor by the river of Gozan, and in the cities of
the Medes.

<span id="an_17:7">17:7</span> For so it was, that the children of
Israel had sinned against the LORD their God, who had brought them out
of the land of Egypt, from under the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and
had feared other gods,

<span id="an_17:8">17:8</span> And walked in the statutes of the
heathen, whom the LORD cast out from before the children of Israel, and
of the kings of Israel which they had made.

<span id="an_17:9">17:9</span> And the children of Israel did secretly
things that were not right against the LORD their God, and they built
for themselves high places in all their cities, from the tower of the
watchmen to the fortified city.

<span id="an_17:10">17:10</span> And they set up for themselves images
and groves on every high hill, and under every green tree:

<span id="an_17:11">17:11</span> And there they burnt incense on all the
high places, as did the heathen whom the LORD carried away before them;
and wrought wicked things to provoke the LORD to anger:

<span id="an_17:12">17:12</span> For they served idols, of which the
LORD had said to them, Ye shall not do this thing.

<span id="an_17:13">17:13</span> Yet the LORD testified against Israel,
and against Judah, by all the prophets, and by all the seers, saying,
Turn ye from your evil ways, and keep my commandments and my statutes,
according to all the law which I commanded your fathers, and which I
sent to you by my servants the prophets.

<span id="an_17:14">17:14</span> Notwithstanding, they would not hear,
but hardened their necks, like the neck of their fathers, that did not
believe in the LORD their God.

<span id="an_17:15">17:15</span> And they rejected his statutes, and his
covenant that he made with their fathers, and his testimonies which he
testified against them; and they followed vanity, and became vain, and
went after the heathen that were around them, concerning whom the LORD
had charged them, that they should not do like them.

<span id="an_17:16">17:16</span> And they left all the commandments of
the LORD their God, and made for themselves molten images, even two
calves, and made a grove, and worshiped all the host of heaven, and
served Baal.

<span id="an_17:17">17:17</span> And they caused their sons and their
daughters to pass through the fire, and used divination and
enchantments, and sold themselves to do evil in the sight of the LORD,
to provoke him to anger.

<span id="an_17:18">17:18</span> Therefore the LORD was very angry with
Israel, and removed them out of his sight: there was none left but the
tribe of Judah only.

<span id="an_17:19">17:19</span> Also Judah kept not the commandments of
the LORD their God, but walked in the statutes of Israel which they
made.

<span id="an_17:20">17:20</span> And the LORD rejected all the seed of
Israel, and afflicted them, and delivered them into the hand of
spoilers, until he had cast them out of his sight.

<span id="an_17:21">17:21</span> For he rent Israel from the house of
David; and they made Jeroboam the son of Nebat king: and Jeroboam drove
Israel from following the LORD, and made them sin a great sin.

<span id="an_17:22">17:22</span> For the children of Israel walked in
all the sins of Jeroboam which he did; they departed not from them;

<span id="an_17:23">17:23</span> Until the LORD removed Israel out of
his sight, as he had said by all his servants the prophets. So was
Israel carried away out of their own land to Assyria to this day.

<span id="an_17:24">17:24</span> And the king of Assyria brought men
from Babylon, and from Cuthah, and from Ava, and from Hamath, and from
Sepharvaim, and placed them in the cities of Samaria instead of the
children of Israel: and they possessed Samaria, and dwelt in its cities.

<span id="an_17:25">17:25</span> And so it was at the beginning of their
dwelling there, that they feared not the LORD: therefore the LORD sent
lions among them, which slew some of them.

<span id="an_17:26">17:26</span> Wherefore they spoke to the king of
Assyria, saying, The nations which thou hast removed, and placed in the
cities of Samaria, know not the manner of the God of the land: therefore
he hath sent lions among them, and behold, they slay them, because they
know not the manner of the God of the land.

<span id="an_17:27">17:27</span> Then the king of Assyria commanded,
saying, Carry thither one of the priests whom ye brought from thence;
and let them go and dwell there, and let him teach them the manner of
the God of the land.

<span id="an_17:28">17:28</span> Then one of the priests whom they had
carried away from Samaria came and dwelt in Beth-el, and taught them how
they should fear the LORD.

<span id="an_17:29">17:29</span> Yet, every nation made gods of their
own, and put them in the houses of the high places which the Samaritans
had made, every nation in their cities in which they dwelt.

<span id="an_17:30">17:30</span> And the men of Babylon made
Succoth-benoth, and the men of Cuth made Nergal, and the men of Hamath
made Ashima,

<span id="an_17:31">17:31</span> And the Avites made Nibhaz and Tartak,
and the Sepharvites burnt their children in the fire to Adrammelech and
Anammelech, the gods of Sepharvaim.

<span id="an_17:32">17:32</span> So they feared the LORD, and made to
themselves of the lowest of them priests of the high places, who
sacrificed for them in the houses of the high places.

<span id="an_17:33">17:33</span> They feared the LORD, and served their
own gods, after the manner of the nations whom they carried away from
thence.

<span id="an_17:34">17:34</span> To this day they do after the former
manners: they fear not the LORD, neither do they after their statutes,
or after their ordinances, or after the law and commandment which the
LORD commanded the children of Jacob, whom he named Israel;

<span id="an_17:35">17:35</span> With whom the LORD had made a covenant,
and charged them, saying, Ye shall not fear other gods, nor bow
yourselves to them, nor serve them, nor sacrifice to them:

<span id="an_17:36">17:36</span> But the LORD, who brought you out of
the land of Egypt with great power and an out-stretched arm, him shall
ye fear, and him shall ye worship, and to him shall ye do sacrifice.

<span id="an_17:37">17:37</span> And the statutes, and the ordinances,
and the law, and the commandment which he wrote for you, ye shall
observe to do for evermore; and ye shall not fear other gods.

<span id="an_17:38">17:38</span> And the covenant that I have made with
you ye shall not forget; neither shall ye fear other gods.

<span id="an_17:39">17:39</span> But the LORD your God ye shall fear;
and he will deliver you out of the hand of all your enemies.

<span id="an_17:40">17:40</span> Yet they did not hearken, but they did
after their former manner.

<span id="an_17:41">17:41</span> So these nations feared the LORD, and
served their graven images, both their children, and their children's
children: as did their fathers, so do they to this day.

<span id="an_18:1">18:1</span> Now it came to pass in the third year of
Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel, that Hezekiah the son of Ahaz king of
Judah began to reign.

<span id="an_18:2">18:2</span> Twenty and five years old was he when he
began to reign; and he reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem. His
mother's name also was Abi, the daughter of Zachariah.

<span id="an_18:3">18:3</span> And he did that which was right in the
sight of the LORD, according to all that David his father did.

<span id="an_18:4">18:4</span> He removed the high places, and broke the
images, and cut down the groves, and broke in pieces the brazen serpent
that Moses had made: for till those days the children of Israel burnt
incense to it: and he called it Nehushtan.

<span id="an_18:5">18:5</span> He trusted in the LORD God of Israel; so
that after him was none like him among all the kings of Judah, nor any
that were before him.

<span id="an_18:6">18:6</span> For he cleaved to the LORD, and departed
not from following him, but kept his commandments, which the LORD
commanded Moses.

<span id="an_18:7">18:7</span> And the LORD was with him; and he
prospered whithersoever he went forth: and he rebelled against the king
of Assyria, and served him not.

<span id="an_18:8">18:8</span> He smote the Philistines, even to Gaza,
and its borders, from the tower of the watchmen to the fortified city.

<span id="an_18:9">18:9</span> And it came to pass in the fourth year of
king Hezekiah, which was the seventh year of Hoshea son of Elah king of
Israel, that Shalmaneser king of Assyria came up against Samaria, and
besieged it.

<span id="an_18:10">18:10</span> And at the end of three years they took
it: even in the sixth year of Hezekiah, that is the ninth year of Hoshea
king of Israel, Samaria was taken.

<span id="an_18:11">18:11</span> And the king of Assyria carried away
Israel to Assyria, and put them in Halah and in Habor by the river of
Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes:

<span id="an_18:12">18:12</span> Because they obeyed not the voice of
the LORD their God, but transgressed his covenant, and all that Moses
the servant of the LORD commanded, and would not hear them, nor do them.

<span id="an_18:13">18:13</span> Now in the fourteenth year of king
Hezekiah Sennacherib king of Assyria came up against all the fortified
cities of Judah, and took them.

<span id="an_18:14">18:14</span> And Hezekiah king of Judah sent to the
king of Assyria to Lachish, saying, I have offended; return from me:
that which thou puttest on me I will bear. And the king of Assyria
appointed to Hezekiah king of Judah three hundred talents of silver and
thirty talents of gold.

<span id="an_18:15">18:15</span> And Hezekiah gave him all the silver
that was found in the house of the LORD, and in the treasures of the
king's house.

<span id="an_18:16">18:16</span> At that time did Hezekiah cut off the
gold from the doors of the temple of the LORD, and from the pillars
which Hezekiah king of Judah had overlaid, and gave it to the king of
Assyria.

<span id="an_18:17">18:17</span> And the king of Assyria sent Tartan and
Rab-saris and Rab-shakeh from Lachish to king Hezekiah with a great army
against Jerusalem: and they went up, and came to Jerusalem: and when
they had come up, they came and stood by the conduit of the upper pool,
which is in the highway of the fuller's field.

<span id="an_18:18">18:18</span> And when they had called to the king,
there came out to them Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the
household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph the
recorder.

<span id="an_18:19">18:19</span> And Rab-shakeh said to them, Speak ye
now to Hezekiah, Thus saith the great king, the king of Assyria, What
confidence is this in which thou trustest?

<span id="an_18:20">18:20</span> Thou sayest, but they are but vain
words, I have counsel and strength for the war. Now in whom dost thou
trust, that thou rebellest against me?

<span id="an_18:21">18:21</span> Now behold, thou trustest upon the
staff of this bruised reed, even upon Egypt, on which if a man leaneth,
it will go into his hand, and pierce it: so is Pharaoh king of Egypt to
all that trust on him.

<span id="an_18:22">18:22</span> But if ye say to me, We trust in the
LORD our God: is not that he whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah
hath taken away, and hath said to Judah and Jerusalem, Ye shall worship
before this altar in Jerusalem?

<span id="an_18:23">18:23</span> Now therefore, I pray thee, give
pledges to my lord the king of Assyria, and I will deliver thee two
thousand horses, if thou shalt be able on thy part to set riders upon
them.

<span id="an_18:24">18:24</span> How then wilt thou turn away the face
of one captain of the least of my master's servants, and put thy trust
on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen?

<span id="an_18:25">18:25</span> Have I now come up without the LORD
against this place to destroy it? The LORD said to me, Go up against
this land, and destroy it.

<span id="an_18:26">18:26</span> Then said Eliakim the son of Hilkiah,
and Shebna and Joah, to Rab-shakeh, Speak, I pray thee, to thy servants
in the Syrian language; for we understand it: and talk not with us in
the Jews language in the ears of the people that are on the wall.

<span id="an_18:27">18:27</span> But Rab-shakeh said to them, Hath my
master sent me to thy master, and to thee, to speak these words? hath he
not sent me to the men who sit on the wall, that they may feed on their
vilest excretions with you?

<span id="an_18:28">18:28</span> Then Rab-shakeh stood and cried with a
loud voice in the Jews language, and spoke, saying, Hear the word of the
great king, the king of Assyria:

<span id="an_18:29">18:29</span> Thus saith the king, Let not Hezekiah
deceive you: for he shall not be able to deliver you out of his hand:

<span id="an_18:30">18:30</span> Neither let Hezekiah make you trust in
the LORD, saying, The LORD will surely deliver us, and this city shall
not be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria.

<span id="an_18:31">18:31</span> Hearken not to Hezekiah: for thus saith
the king of Assyria, Make an agreement with me by a present, and come
out to me, and then eat ye every man of his own vine, and every one of
his fig-tree, and drink ye every one the waters of his cistern:

<span id="an_18:32">18:32</span> Until I come and take you away to a
land like your own land, a land of corn and wine, a land of bread and
vineyards, a land of olive-oil and of honey, that ye may live, and not
die: and hearken not to Hezekiah, when he persuadeth you, saying, The
LORD will deliver us.

<span id="an_18:33">18:33</span> Hath any of the gods of the nations
delivered at all his land out of the hand of the king of Assyria?

<span id="an_18:34">18:34</span> Where are the gods of Hamath, and of
Arpad? where are the gods of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivah? have they
delivered Samaria out of my hand?

<span id="an_18:35">18:35</span> Who are they among all the gods of the
countries, that have delivered their country out of my hand, that the
LORD should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand?

<span id="an_18:36">18:36</span> But the people held their peace, and
answered him not a word: for the king's commandment was, saying, Answer
him not.

<span id="an_18:37">18:37</span> Then came Eliakim the son of Hilkiah,
who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son of
Asaph the recorder, to Hezekiah with their clothes rent, and told him
the words of Rab-shakeh.

<span id="an_19:1">19:1</span> And it came to pass, when king Hezekiah
heard it, that he rent his clothes, and covered himself with sackcloth,
and went into the house of the LORD.

<span id="an_19:2">19:2</span> And he sent Eliakim, who was over the
household, and Shebna the scribe, and the elders of the priests, covered
with sackcloth, to Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz.

<span id="an_19:3">19:3</span> And they said to him, Thus saith
Hezekiah, This day is a day of trouble, and of rebuke, and blasphemy:
for the children have come to the birth, and there is not strength to
bring forth.

<span id="an_19:4">19:4</span> It may be the LORD thy God will hear all
the words of Rab-shakeh, whom the king of Assyria his master hath sent
to reproach the living God; and will reprove the words which the LORD
thy God hath heard: wherefore lift up thy prayer for the remnant that
are left.

<span id="an_19:5">19:5</span> So the servants of king Hezekiah came to
Isaiah.

<span id="an_19:6">19:6</span> And Isaiah said to them, Thus shall ye
say to your master, Thus saith the LORD, Be not afraid of the words
which thou hast heard, with which the servants of the king of Assyria
have blasphemed me.

<span id="an_19:7">19:7</span> Behold, I will send a blast upon him, and
he shall hear a rumor, and shall return to his own land; and I will
cause him to fall by the sword in his own land.

<span id="an_19:8">19:8</span> So Rab-shakeh returned, and found the
king of Assyria warring against Libnah: for he had heard that he had
departed from Lachish.

<span id="an_19:9">19:9</span> And when he heard it said of Tirhakah
king of Cush, Behold, he hath come out to fight against thee: he sent
messengers again to Hezekiah, saying,

<span id="an_19:10">19:10</span> Thus shall ye speak to Hezekiah king of
Judah, saying, Let not thy God in whom thou trustest deceive thee,
saying, Jerusalem shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of
Assyria.

<span id="an_19:11">19:11</span> Behold, thou hast heard what the kings
of Assyria have done to all lands, by destroying them utterly: and shalt
thou be delivered?

<span id="an_19:12">19:12</span> Have the gods of the nations delivered
them which my fathers have destroyed; as Gozan and Haran, and Rezeph,
and the children of Eden who were in Thelasar?

<span id="an_19:13">19:13</span> Where is the king of Hamath, and the
king of Arpad, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, of Hena, and
Ivah?

<span id="an_19:14">19:14</span> And Hezekiah received the letter from
the hand of the messengers, and read it: and Hezekiah went up into the
house of the LORD, and spread it before the LORD.

<span id="an_19:15">19:15</span> And Hezekiah prayed before the LORD,
and said, O LORD God of Israel, who dwellest between the cherubim, thou
art the God, even thou alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth; thou
hast made heaven and earth.

<span id="an_19:16">19:16</span> LORD, bow down thy ear, and hear: open,
LORD, thy eyes, and see: and hear the words of Sennacherib, who hath
sent him to reproach the living God.

<span id="an_19:17">19:17</span> Of a truth, LORD, the kings of Assyria
have destroyed the nations and their lands,

<span id="an_19:18">19:18</span> And have cast their gods into the fire:
for they were no gods, but the work of men's hands, wood and stone:
therefore they have destroyed them.

<span id="an_19:19">19:19</span> Now therefore, O LORD our God, I
beseech thee, save thou us from his hand, that all the kingdoms of the
earth may know that thou art the LORD God, even thou only.

<span id="an_19:20">19:20</span> Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to
Hezekiah, saying, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, That which thou
hast prayed to me against Sennacherib king of Assyria I have heard.

<span id="an_19:21">19:21</span> This is the word that the LORD hath
spoken concerning him; The virgin the daughter of Zion hath despised
thee, and laughed thee to scorn; the daughter of Jerusalem hath shaken
her head at thee.

<span id="an_19:22">19:22</span> Whom hast thou reproached and
blasphemed? and against whom hast thou exalted thy voice, and lifted up
thy eyes on high: even against the Holy One of Israel.

<span id="an_19:23">19:23</span> By thy messengers thou hast reproached
the Lord, and hast said, With the multitude of my chariots I am come up
to the hight of the mountains, to the sides of Lebanon, and will cut
down its tall cedar trees, and its choice fir trees: and I will enter
into the lodgings of his borders, and into the forest of his Carmel.

<span id="an_19:24">19:24</span> I have digged and drank strange waters,
and with the sole of my feet have I dried up all the rivers of besieged
places.

<span id="an_19:25">19:25</span> Hast thou not heard long ago how I have
done it, and of ancient times that I have formed it? now have I brought
it to pass, that thou shouldst be to lay waste fortified cities in
ruinous heaps.

<span id="an_19:26">19:26</span> Therefore their inhabitants were of
small power, they were dismayed and confounded; they were as the grass
of the field, and as the green herb, as the grass on the house-tops, and
as corn blasted before it is grown up.

<span id="an_19:27">19:27</span> But I know thy abode, and thy going
out, and thy coming in, and thy rage against me.

<span id="an_19:28">19:28</span> Because thy rage against me and thy
tumult is come up into my ears, therefore I will put my hook in thy
nose, and my bridle in thy lips, and I will turn thee back by the way by
which thou camest.

<span id="an_19:29">19:29</span> And this shall be a sign to thee, Ye
shall eat this year such things as grow of themselves, and in the second
year that which springeth of the same; and in the third year sow ye, and
reap, and plant vineyards, and eat the fruits of it.

<span id="an_19:30">19:30</span> And the remnant that hath escaped of
the house of Judah shall yet again take root downward, and bear fruit
upward.

<span id="an_19:31">19:31</span> For out of Jerusalem shall go forth a
remnant, and they that escape from mount Zion: the zeal of the LORD of
hosts shall do this.

<span id="an_19:32">19:32</span> Therefore thus saith the LORD
concerning the king of Assyria, He shall not come into this city, nor
shoot an arrow there, nor come before it with shield, nor cast a bank
against it.

<span id="an_19:33">19:33</span> By the way that he came, by the same
shall he return, and shall not come into this city, saith the LORD.

<span id="an_19:34">19:34</span> For I will defend this city, to save
it, for my own sake, and for my servant David's sake.

<span id="an_19:35">19:35</span> And it came to pass that night, that
the angel of the LORD went out, and smote in the camp of the Assyrians a
hundred and eighty five thousand: and when they arose early in the
morning, behold, they were all dead corpses.

<span id="an_19:36">19:36</span> So Sennacherib king of Assyria
departed, and went and returned, and dwelt at Nineveh.

<span id="an_19:37">19:37</span> And it came to pass, as he was
worshiping in the house of Nisroch his god, that Adrammelech and
Sharezer his sons smote him with the sword: and they escaped into the
land of Armenia. And Esar-haddon his son reigned in his stead.

<span id="an_20:1">20:1</span> In those days was Hezekiah sick to death.
And the prophet Isaiah the son of Amoz came to him, and said to him,
Thus saith the LORD, Set thy house in order; for thou shalt die, and not
live.

<span id="an_20:2">20:2</span> Then he turned his face to the wall, and
prayed to the LORD, saying,

<span id="an_20:3">20:3</span> I beseech thee, O LORD, remember now how
I have walked before thee in truth and with a perfect heart, and have
done that which is good in thy sight. And Hezekiah wept grievously.

<span id="an_20:4">20:4</span> And it came to pass, before Isaiah had
gone out into the middle court, that the word of the LORD came to him,
saying,

<span id="an_20:5">20:5</span> Turn again, and tell Hezekiah the captain
of my people, Thus saith the LORD, the God of David thy father, I have
heard thy prayer, I have seen thy tears: behold, I will heal thee: on
the third day thou shalt go up to the house of the LORD.

<span id="an_20:6">20:6</span> And I will add to thy days fifteen years;
and I will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the king of
Assyria; and I will defend this city for my own sake, and for my servant
David's sake.

<span id="an_20:7">20:7</span> And Isaiah said, Take a lump of figs. And
they took and laid it on the boil, and he recovered.

<span id="an_20:8">20:8</span> And Hezekiah said to Isaiah, What shall
be the sign that the LORD will heal me, and that I shall go up into the
house of the LORD the third day?

<span id="an_20:9">20:9</span> And Isaiah said, This sign shalt thou
have of the LORD, that the LORD will do the thing that he hath spoken:
shall the shadow go forward ten degrees, or go back ten degrees?

<span id="an_20:10">20:10</span> And Hezekiah answered, It is a light
thing for the shadow to go forward ten degrees: no, but let the shadow
return backward ten degrees.

<span id="an_20:11">20:11</span> And Isaiah the prophet cried to the
LORD: and he brought the shadow ten degrees backward, by which it had
gone down on the dial of Ahaz.

<span id="an_20:12">20:12</span> At that time Berodach-baladan, the son
of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a present to Hezekiah: for
he had heard that Hezekiah had been sick.

<span id="an_20:13">20:13</span> And Hezekiah hearkened to them, and
showed them all the house of his precious things, the silver, and the
gold, and the spices, and the precious ointment, and all the house of
his armor, and all that was found in his treasures: there was nothing in
his house, nor in all his dominion, that Hezekiah showed them not.

<span id="an_20:14">20:14</span> Then came Isaiah the prophet to king
Hezekiah, and said to him, What said these men? and from whence came
they to thee? And Hezekiah said, They have come from a far country even
from Babylon.

<span id="an_20:15">20:15</span> And he said, What have they seen in thy
house? And Hezekiah answered, All the things that are in my house have
they seen: there is nothing among my treasures that I have not shown
them.

<span id="an_20:16">20:16</span> And Isaiah said to Hezekiah, Hear the
word of the LORD.

<span id="an_20:17">20:17</span> Behold, the days come, that all that is
in thy house, and that which thy fathers have laid up in store to this
day, shall be carried into Babylon: nothing shall be left, saith the
LORD.

<span id="an_20:18">20:18</span> And of thy sons that shall issue from
thee, which thou shalt beget, shall they take away; and they shall be
eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon.

<span id="an_20:19">20:19</span> Then said Hezekiah to Isaiah, Good is
the word of the LORD which thou hast spoken. And he said, Is it not
good, if peace and truth shall be in my days?

<span id="an_20:20">20:20</span> And the rest of the acts of Hezekiah,
and all his might, and how he made a pool, and a conduit, and brought
water into the city, are they not written in the book of the chronicles
of the kings of Judah?

<span id="an_20:21">20:21</span> And Hezekiah slept with his fathers:
and Manasseh his son reigned in his stead.

<span id="an_21:1">21:1</span> Manasseh was twelve years old when he
began to reign, and he reigned fifty and five years in Jerusalem. And
his mother's name was Hephzi-bah.

<span id="an_21:2">21:2</span> And he did that which was evil in the
sight of the LORD, after the abominations of the heathen, whom the LORD
cast out before the children of Israel.

<span id="an_21:3">21:3</span> For he built again the high places which
Hezekiah his father had destroyed; and he reared altars for Baal, and
made a grove, as did Ahab king of Israel; and worshiped all the host of
heaven, and served them.

<span id="an_21:4">21:4</span> And he built altars in the house of the
LORD, of which the LORD said, In Jerusalem will I put my name.

<span id="an_21:5">21:5</span> And he built altars for all the host of
heaven in the two courts of the house of the LORD.

<span id="an_21:6">21:6</span> And he made his son pass through the
fire, and observed times, and used enchantments, and dealt with familiar
spirits and wizards: he committed much wickedness in the sight of the
LORD, to provoke him to anger.

<span id="an_21:7">21:7</span> And he set a graven image of the grove
that he had made in the house, of which the LORD said to David, and to
Solomon his son, In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen
out of all tribes of Israel, will I put my name for ever:

<span id="an_21:8">21:8</span> Neither will I make the feet of Israel
move any more out of the land which I gave their fathers; only if they
will observe to do according to all that I have commanded them, and
according to all the law that my servant Moses commanded them.

<span id="an_21:9">21:9</span> But they hearkened not: and Manasseh
seduced them to do more evil than did the nations whom the LORD
destroyed before the children of Israel.

<span id="an_21:10">21:10</span> And the LORD spoke by his servants the
prophets, saying,

<span id="an_21:11">21:11</span> Because Manasseh king of Judah hath
done these abominations, and hath done wickedly above all that the
Amorites did, who were before him, and hath made Judah also to sin with
his idols:

<span id="an_21:12">21:12</span> Therefore thus saith the LORD God of
Israel, Behold, I am bringing such evil upon Jerusalem and Judah, that
whoever heareth of it, both his ears shall tingle.

<span id="an_21:13">21:13</span> And I will stretch over Jerusalem the
line of Samaria, and the plummet of the house of Ahab: and I will wipe
Jerusalem as a man wipeth a dish, wiping it, and turning it upside down.

<span id="an_21:14">21:14</span> And I will forsake the remnant of my
inheritance, and deliver them into the hand of their enemies; and they
shall become a prey and a spoil to all their enemies;

<span id="an_21:15">21:15</span> Because they have done that which was
evil in my sight, and have provoked me to anger, since the day their
fathers came out of Egypt, even to this day.

<span id="an_21:16">21:16</span> Moreover, Manasseh shed innocent blood
very much, till he had filled Jerusalem from one end to another; besides
his sin with which he made Judah to sin, in doing evil in the sight of
the LORD.

<span id="an_21:17">21:17</span> Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh,
and all that he did, and his sin that he sinned, are they not written in
the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?

<span id="an_21:18">21:18</span> And Manasseh slept with his fathers,
and was buried in the garden of his own house, in the garden of Uzza:
and Amon his son reigned in his stead.

<span id="an_21:19">21:19</span> Amon was twenty and two years old when
he began to reign, and he reigned two years in Jerusalem. And his
mother's name was Meshullemeth, the daughter of Haruz of Jotbah.

<span id="an_21:20">21:20</span> And he did that which was evil in the
sight of the LORD, as his father Manasseh did.

<span id="an_21:21">21:21</span> And he walked in all the way that his
father walked in, and served the idols that his father served, and
worshiped them:

<span id="an_21:22">21:22</span> And he forsook the LORD God of his
fathers, and walked not in the way of the LORD.

<span id="an_21:23">21:23</span> And the servants of Amon conspired
against him, and slew the king in his own house.

<span id="an_21:24">21:24</span> And the people of the land slew all
them that had conspired against king Amon; and the people of the land
made Josiah his son king in his stead.

<span id="an_21:25">21:25</span> Now the rest of the acts of Amon which
he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings
of Judah?

<span id="an_21:26">21:26</span> And he was buried in his sepulcher in
the garden of Uzza: and Josiah his son reigned in his stead.

<span id="an_22:1">22:1</span> Josiah was eight years old when he began
to reign, and he reigned thirty and one years in Jerusalem. And his
mother's name was Jedidah the daughter of Adaiah of Boscath.

<span id="an_22:2">22:2</span> And he did that which was right in the
sight of the LORD, and walked in all the way of David his father, and
turned not aside to the right hand or to the left.

<span id="an_22:3">22:3</span> And it came to pass in the eighteenth
year of king Josiah, that the king sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah, the
son of Meshullam, the scribe, to the house of the LORD, saying,

<span id="an_22:4">22:4</span> Go to Hilkiah the high priest, that he
may sum the silver which is brought into the house of the LORD, which
the keepers of the door have gathered from the people:

<span id="an_22:5">22:5</span> And let them deliver it into the hand of
the doers of the work, that have the oversight of the house of the LORD:
and let them give it to the doers of the work, which is in the house of
the LORD, to repair the breaches of the house,

<span id="an_22:6">22:6</span> To carpenters, and builders, and masons,
and to buy timber, and hewn stone to repair the house.

<span id="an_22:7">22:7</span> But there was no reckoning made with them
of the money that was delivered into their hand, because they dealt
faithfully.

<span id="an_22:8">22:8</span> And Hilkiah the high priest said to
Shaphan the scribe, I have found the book of the law in the house of the
LORD. And Hilkiah gave the book to Shaphan, and he read it.

<span id="an_22:9">22:9</span> And Shaphan the scribe came to the king,
and brought the king word again, and said, Thy servants have gathered
the money that was found in the house, and have delivered it into the
hand of them that do the work, that have the oversight of the house of
the LORD.

<span id="an_22:10">22:10</span> And Shaphan the scribe showed the king,
saying, Hilkiah the priest hath delivered me a book. And Shaphan read it
before the king.

<span id="an_22:11">22:11</span> And it came to pass, when the king had
heard the words of the book of the law, that he rent his clothes.

<span id="an_22:12">22:12</span> And the king commanded Hilkiah the
priest, and Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Achbor the son of Michaiah,
and Shaphan the scribe, and Asahiah a servant of the king's, saying,

<span id="an_22:13">22:13</span> Go ye, inquire of the LORD for me, and
for the people, and for all Judah, concerning the words of this book
that is found: for great is the wrath of the LORD that is kindled
against us, because our fathers have not hearkened to the words of this
book, to do according to all that which is written concerning us.

<span id="an_22:14">22:14</span> So Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam, and
Achbor, and Shaphan, and Asahiah, went to Huldah the prophetess, the
wife of Shallum the son of Tikvah, the son of Harhas, keeper of the
wardrobe; (now she dwelt in Jerusalem in the college;) and they communed
with her.

<span id="an_22:15">22:15</span> And she said to them, Thus saith the
LORD God of Israel, Tell the man that sent you to me,

<span id="an_22:16">22:16</span> Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will
bring evil upon this place, and upon its inhabitants, even all the words
of the book which the king of Judah hath read:

<span id="an_22:17">22:17</span> Because they have forsaken me, and have
burned incense to other gods, that they might provoke me to anger with
all the works of their hands; therefore my wrath shall be kindled
against this place and shall not be quenched.

<span id="an_22:18">22:18</span> But to the king of Judah who sent you
to inquire of the LORD, thus shall ye say to him, Thus saith the LORD
God of Israel, concerning the words which thou hast heard;

<span id="an_22:19">22:19</span> Because thy heart was tender, and thou
hast humbled thyself before the LORD, when thou heardest what I spoke
against this place, and against its inhabitants, that they should become
a desolation and a curse, and hast rent thy clothes, and wept before me;
I also have heard thee, saith the LORD.

<span id="an_22:20">22:20</span> Behold therefore, I will gather thee to
thy fathers, and thou shalt be gathered into thy grave in peace; and thy
eyes shall not see all the evil which I will bring upon this place. And
they brought the king word again.

<span id="an_23:1">23:1</span> And the king sent, and they gathered to
him all the elders of Judah and of Jerusalem.

<span id="an_23:2">23:2</span> And the king went up into the house of
the LORD, and all the men of Judah and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem
with him, and the priests, and the prophets, and all the people, both
small and great: and he read in their ears all the words of the book of
the covenant which was found in the house of the LORD.

<span id="an_23:3">23:3</span> And the king stood by a pillar, and made
a covenant before the LORD, to walk after the LORD, and to keep his
commandments, and his testimonies, and his statutes, with all their
heart and all their soul, to perform the words of this covenant that
were written in this book. And all the people stood to the covenant.

<span id="an_23:4">23:4</span> And the king commanded Hilkiah the high
priest, and the priests of the second order, and the keepers of the
door, to bring forth out of the temple of the LORD all the vessels that
were made for Baal, and for the grove, and for all the host of heaven:
and he burned them without Jerusalem in the fields of Kidron, and
carried the ashes of them to Beth-el.

<span id="an_23:5">23:5</span> And he put down the idolatrous priests,
whom the kings of Judah had ordained to burn incense in the high places
in the cities of Judah, and in the places around Jerusalem; them also
that burned incense to Baal, to the sun, and to the moon, and to the
planets, and to all the host of heaven.

<span id="an_23:6">23:6</span> And he brought out the grove from the
house of the LORD, without Jerusalem, to the brook Kidron, and burned it
at the brook Kidron, and stamped it small to powder, and cast the powder
of it upon the graves of the children of the people.

<span id="an_23:7">23:7</span> And he broke down the houses of the
sodomites that were by the house of the LORD, where the women wove
hangings for the grove.

<span id="an_23:8">23:8</span> And he brought all the priests out of the
cities of Judah, and defiled the high places where the priests had burnt
incense, from Geba to Beer-sheba, and broke down the high places of the
gates that were in the entrance of the gate of Joshua the governor of
the city, which were on a man's left hand at the gate of the city.

<span id="an_23:9">23:9</span> Nevertheless, the priests of the high
places came not up to the altar of the LORD in Jerusalem, but they ate
of the unleavened bread among their brethren.

<span id="an_23:10">23:10</span> And he defiled Topheth, which is in the
valley of the children of Hinnom, that no man might make his son or his
daughter to pass through the fire to Molech.

<span id="an_23:11">23:11</span> And he took away the horses that the
kings of Judah had given to the sun, at the entrance of the house of the
LORD, by the chamber of Nathan-melech the chamberlain, which was in the
suburbs, and burned the chariots of the sun with fire.

<span id="an_23:12">23:12</span> And the altars that were on the top of
the upper chamber of Ahaz, which the kings of Judah had made, and the
altars which Manasseh had made in the two courts of the house of the
LORD, did the king beat down, and broke them down from thence, and cast
the dust of them into the brook Kidron.

<span id="an_23:13">23:13</span> And the high places that were before
Jerusalem, which were on the right hand of the mount of corruption,
which Solomon the king of Israel had built for Ashtoreth the abomination
of the Zidonians, and for Chemosh the abomination of the Moabites, and
for Milcom the abomination of the children of Ammon, did the king
defile.

<span id="an_23:14">23:14</span> And he broke in pieces the images, and
cut down the groves, and filled their places with the bones of men.

<span id="an_23:15">23:15</span> Moreover, the altar that was at
Beth-el, and the high place which Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made
Israel to sin, had made, both that altar and the high place he broke
down, and burned the high place, and stamped it small to powder, and
burned the grove.

<span id="an_23:16">23:16</span> And as Josiah turned himself, he espied
the sepulchers that were there on the mount, and sent, and took the
bones out of the sepulchers, and burned them upon the altar, and
polluted it, according to the word of the LORD which the man of God
proclaimed, who proclaimed these words.

<span id="an_23:17">23:17</span> Then he said, What title is that which
I see? And the men of the city told him, It is the sepulcher of the man
of God, who came from Judah, and proclaimed these things that thou hast
done against the altar of Beth-el.

<span id="an_23:18">23:18</span> And he said, Let him alone; let no man
move his bones. So they let his bones alone, with the bones of the
prophet that came out of Samaria.

<span id="an_23:19">23:19</span> And all the houses also of the high
places that were in the cities of Samaria, which the kings of Israel had
made to provoke the LORD to anger, Josiah took away, and did to them
according to all the acts that he had done in Beth-el.

<span id="an_23:20">23:20</span> And he slew all the priests of the high
places, that were there upon the altars, and burnt men's bones upon
them, and returned to Jerusalem.

<span id="an_23:21">23:21</span> And the king commanded all the people,
saying, Keep the passover to the LORD your God, as it is written in the
book of this covenant.

<span id="an_23:22">23:22</span> Surely there was not held such a
passover from the days of the judges that judged Israel, nor in all the
days of the kings of Israel, nor of the kings of Judah.

<span id="an_23:23">23:23</span> But in the eighteenth year of king
Josiah, in which this passover was held to the LORD in Jerusalem.

<span id="an_23:24">23:24</span> Moreover the workers with familiar
spirits, and the wizards, and the images, and the idols, and all the
abominations that were seen in the land of Judah and in Jerusalem, did
Josiah put away, that he might perform the words of the law which were
written in the book that Hilkiah the priest found in the house of the
LORD.

<span id="an_23:25">23:25</span> And like him was there no king before
him, that turned to the LORD with all his heart, and with all his soul,
and with all his might, according to all the law of Moses; neither after
him arose there any like him.

<span id="an_23:26">23:26</span> Notwithstanding, the LORD turned not
from the fierceness of his great wrath, with which his anger was kindled
against Judah, because of all the provocations by which Manasseh had
provoked him.

<span id="an_23:27">23:27</span> And the LORD said, I will remove Judah
also out of my sight, as I have removed Israel, and will reject this
city Jerusalem which I have chosen, and the house of which I said, My
name shall be there.

<span id="an_23:28">23:28</span> Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and
all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of
the kings of Judah?

<span id="an_23:29">23:29</span> In his days Pharaoh-nechoh king of
Egypt went up against the king of Assyria to the river Euphrates: and
king Josiah went against him; and he slew him at Megiddo, when he had
seen him.

<span id="an_23:30">23:30</span> And his servants carried him in a
chariot dead from Megiddo, and brought him to Jerusalem, and buried him
in his own sepulcher. And the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son
of Josiah and anointed him, and made him king in his father's stead.

<span id="an_23:31">23:31</span> Jehoahaz was twenty and three years old
when he began to reign; and he reigned three months in Jerusalem. And
his mother's name was Hamutal, the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.

<span id="an_23:32">23:32</span> And he did that which was evil in the
sight of the LORD, according to all that his fathers had done.

<span id="an_23:33">23:33</span> And Pharaoh-nechoh put him in bands at
Riblah in the land of Hamath, that he might not reign in Jerusalem; and
subjected the land to a tribute of a hundred talents of silver, and a
talent of gold.

<span id="an_23:34">23:34</span> And Pharaoh-nechoh made Eliakim the son
of Josiah king in the room of Josiah his father, and turned his name to
Jehoiakim, and took Jehoahaz away: and he came to Egypt and died there.

<span id="an_23:35">23:35</span> And Jehoiakim gave the silver and the
gold to Pharaoh; but he taxed the land to give the money according to
the commandment of Pharaoh: he exacted the silver and the gold from the
people of the land, from every one according to his taxation, to give it
to Pharaoh-nechoh.

<span id="an_23:36">23:36</span> Jehoiakim was twenty and five years old
when he began to reign; and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. And
his mother's name was Zebudah, the daughter of Pedaiah of Rumah.

<span id="an_23:37">23:37</span> And he did that which was evil in the
sight of the LORD, according to all that his fathers had done.

<span id="an_24:1">24:1</span> In his days Nebuchadnezzar king of
Babylon came up, and Jehoiakim became his servant three years: then he
turned and rebelled against him.

<span id="an_24:2">24:2</span> And the LORD sent against him bands of
the Chaldees, and bands of the Syrians, and bands of the Moabites, and
bands of the children of Ammon, and sent them against Judah to destroy
it, according to the word of the LORD, which he spoke by his servants
the prophets.

<span id="an_24:3">24:3</span> Surely at the commandment of the LORD
came this upon Judah, to remove them out of his sight, for the sins of
Manasseh, according to all that he did;

<span id="an_24:4">24:4</span> And also for the innocent blood that he
shed: for he filled Jerusalem with innocent blood; which the LORD would
not pardon.

<span id="an_24:5">24:5</span> Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim,
and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles
of the kings of Judah?

<span id="an_24:6">24:6</span> So Jehoiakim slept with his fathers: and
Jehoiachin his son reigned in his stead.

<span id="an_24:7">24:7</span> And the king of Egypt came not again any
more out of his land: for the king of Babylon had taken from the river
of Egypt to the river Euphrates all that pertained to the king of Egypt.

<span id="an_24:8">24:8</span> Jehoiachin was eighteen years old when he
began to reign, and he reigned in Jerusalem three months. And his
mother's name was Nehushta, the daughter of Elnathan of Jerusalem.

<span id="an_24:9">24:9</span> And he did that which was evil in the
sight of the LORD, according to all that his father had done.

<span id="an_24:10">24:10</span> At that time the servants of
Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up against Jerusalem, and the city
was besieged.

<span id="an_24:11">24:11</span> And Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came
against the city, and his servants besieged it.

<span id="an_24:12">24:12</span> And Jehoiachin the king of Judah went
out to the king of Babylon, he, and his mother, and his servants, and
his princes, and his officers: and the king of Babylon took him in the
eighth year of his reign.

<span id="an_24:13">24:13</span> And he carried out thence all the
treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king's
house, and cut in pieces all the vessels of gold which Solomon king of
Israel had made in the temple of the LORD, as the LORD had said.

<span id="an_24:14">24:14</span> And he carried away all Jerusalem, and
all the princes, and all the mighty men of valor, even ten thousand
captives, and all the artificers, and smiths: none remained, save the
poorest sort of the people of the land.

<span id="an_24:15">24:15</span> And he carried away Jehoiachin to
Babylon, and the king's mother, and the king's wives, and his officers,
and the mighty of the land, those carried he into captivity from
Jerusalem to Babylon.

<span id="an_24:16">24:16</span> And all the men of might, even seven
thousand, and artificers and smiths a thousand, all that were strong and
apt for war, even them the king of Babylon brought captive to Babylon.

<span id="an_24:17">24:17</span> And the king of Babylon made Mattaniah
his father's brother king in his stead, and changed his name to
Zedekiah.

<span id="an_24:18">24:18</span> Zedekiah was twenty and one years old
when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. And
his mother's name was Hamutal, the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.

<span id="an_24:19">24:19</span> And he did that which was evil in the
sight of the LORD, according to all that Jehoiakim had done.

<span id="an_24:20">24:20</span> For through the anger of the LORD it
came to pass in Jerusalem and Judah, until he had cast them out from his
presence, that Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.

<span id="an_25:1">25:1</span> And it came to pass in the ninth year of
his reign, in the tenth month, in the tenth day of the month, that
Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came, he, and all his army, against
Jerusalem, and encamped against it; and they built forts against it on
all sides.

<span id="an_25:2">25:2</span> And the city was besieged to the eleventh
year of king Zedekiah.

<span id="an_25:3">25:3</span> And on the ninth day of the fourth month
the famine prevailed in the city, and there was no bread for the people
of the land.

<span id="an_25:4">25:4</span> And the city was broken up, and all the
men of war fled by night by the way of the gate between two walls, which
is by the king's garden: (now the Chaldees were against the city on all
sides:) and the king went the way towards the plain.

<span id="an_25:5">25:5</span> And the army of the Chaldees pursued the
king, and overtook him in the plains of Jericho: and all his army were
scattered from him.

<span id="an_25:6">25:6</span> So they took the king, and brought him to
the king of Babylon to Riblah; and they gave judgment upon him.

<span id="an_25:7">25:7</span> And they slew the sons of Zedekiah before
his eyes, and put out the eyes of Zedekiah, and bound him with fetters
of brass, and carried him to Babylon.

<span id="an_25:8">25:8</span> And in the fifth month, on the seventh
day of the month, which is the nineteenth year of king Nebuchadnezzar
king of Babylon, came Nebuzar-adan, captain of the guard, a servant of
the king of Babylon, to Jerusalem:

<span id="an_25:9">25:9</span> And he burnt the house of the LORD, and
the king's house, and all the houses of Jerusalem, and every great man's
house he burnt with fire.

<span id="an_25:10">25:10</span> And all the army of the Chaldees, that
were with the captain of the guard, broke down the walls of Jerusalem on
all sides.

<span id="an_25:11">25:11</span> Now the rest of the people that were
left in the city, and the fugitives that fell away to the king of
Babylon, with the remnant of the multitude, did Nebuzar-adan the captain
of the guard carry away.

<span id="an_25:12">25:12</span> But the captain of the guard left of
the poor of the land to be vine-dressers and husbandmen.

<span id="an_25:13">25:13</span> And the pillars of brass that were in
the house of the LORD, and the bases, and the brazen sea that was in the
house of the LORD, did the Chaldees break in pieces, and carried the
brass of them to Babylon.

<span id="an_25:14">25:14</span> And the pots, and the shovels, and the
snuffers, and the spoons, and all the vessels of brass with which they
ministered, they took away.

<span id="an_25:15">25:15</span> And the fire-pans, and the bowls, and
such things as were of gold, in gold, and of silver, in silver, the
captain of the guard took away.

<span id="an_25:16">25:16</span> The two pillars, one sea, and the bases
which Solomon had made for the house of the LORD; the brass of all these
vessels was without weight.

<span id="an_25:17">25:17</span> The hight of the one pillar was
eighteen cubits, and the capital upon it was brass: and the hight of the
capital three cubits; and the wreathen work, and pomegranates upon the
capital around, all of brass: and like to these had the second pillar
with wreathen work.

<span id="an_25:18">25:18</span> And the captain of the guard took
Seraiah the chief priest, and Zephaniah the second priest, and the three
keepers of the door:

<span id="an_25:19">25:19</span> And out of the city he took an officer
that was set over the men of war, and five men of them that were in the
king's presence, who were found in the city, and the principal scribe of
the host, who mustered the people of the land, and sixty men of the
people of the land that were found in the city:

<span id="an_25:20">25:20</span> And Nebuzar-adan captain of the guard
took these, and brought them to the king of Babylon to Riblah:

<span id="an_25:21">25:21</span> And the king of Babylon smote them, and
slew them at Riblah in the land of Hamath. So Judah was carried away out
of their land.

<span id="an_25:22">25:22</span> And as for the people that remained in
the land of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had left, even
over them he made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, ruler.

<span id="an_25:23">25:23</span> And when all the captains of the
armies, they and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had made
Gedaliah governor, there came to Gedaliah to Mizpah, even Ishmael the
son of Nethaniah, and Johanan the son of Careah, and Seraiah the son of
Tanhumeth the Netophathite, and Jaazaniah the son of Maachathite, they
and their men.

<span id="an_25:24">25:24</span> And Gedaliah swore to them, and to
their men, and said to them, Fear not to be the servants of the
Chaldees: dwell in the land, and serve the king of Babylon; and it shall
be well with you.

<span id="an_25:25">25:25</span> But it came to pass in the seventh
month, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, of the
seed royal, came, and ten men with him, and smote Gedaliah, that he
died, and the Jews and the Chaldees that were with him at Mizpah.

<span id="an_25:26">25:26</span> And all the people, both small and
great, and the captains of the armies, arose, and came to Egypt: for
they were afraid of the Chaldees.

<span id="an_25:27">25:27</span> And it came to pass in the seven and
thirtieth year of the captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the
twelfth month, on the seven and twentieth day of the month, that
Evil-merodach king of Babylon, in the year that he began to reign,
lifted up the head of Jehoiachin king of Judah out of prison;

<span id="an_25:28">25:28</span> And he spoke kindly to him, and set his
throne above the throne of the kings that were with him in Babylon;

<span id="an_25:29">25:29</span> And changed his prison garments: and he
ate bread continually before him all the days of his life.

<span id="an_25:30">25:30</span> And his allowance was a continual
allowance given him by the king, a daily rate for every day, all the
days of his life.
