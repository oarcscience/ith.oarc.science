### Webster's Bible: Judges

<span id="an_1:1">1:1</span> Now after the death of Joshua it came to
pass, that the children of Israel asked the LORD, saying, Who shall go
up for us against the Canaanites first to fight against them?

<span id="an_1:2">1:2</span> And the LORD said, Judah shall go up:
behold, I have delivered the land into his hand.

<span id="an_1:3">1:3</span> And Judah said to Simeon his brother, Come
up with me into my lot, that we may fight against the Canaanites; and I
likewise will go with thee into thy lot. So Simeon went with him.

<span id="an_1:4">1:4</span> And Judah went up, and the LORD delivered
the Canaanites and the Perizzites into their hand: and they slew of them
in Bezek ten thousand men.

<span id="an_1:5">1:5</span> And they found Adoni-bezek in Bezek: and
they fought against him, and they slew the Canaanites and the
Perizzites.

<span id="an_1:6">1:6</span> But Adoni-bezek fled; and they pursued him,
and caught him, and cut off his thumbs and his great toes.

<span id="an_1:7">1:7</span> And Adoni-bezek said, seventy kings, having
their thumbs and their great toes cut off, gathered their food under my
table; as I have done, so God hath requited me. And they brought him to
Jerusalem, and there he died.

<span id="an_1:8">1:8</span> (Now the children of Judah had fought
against Jerusalem, and had taken it, and smitten it with the edge of the
sword, and set the city on fire.)

<span id="an_1:9">1:9</span> And afterward the children of Judah went
down to fight against the Canaanites that dwelt on the mountain, and in
the south, and in the valley.

<span id="an_1:10">1:10</span> And Judah went against the Canaanites
that dwelt in Hebron: (now the name of Hebron before was Kirjath-arba:)
and they slew Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai.

<span id="an_1:11">1:11</span> And from thence he went against the
inhabitants of Debir: and the name of Debir before was Kirjath-sepher:

<span id="an_1:12">1:12</span> And Caleb said, He that smiteth
Kirjath-sepher, and taketh it, to him will I give Achsah my daughter for
a wife.

<span id="an_1:13">1:13</span> And Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's
younger brother, took it: and he gave him Achsah his daughter for a
wife.

<span id="an_1:14">1:14</span> And it came to pass, when she came to
him, that she moved him to ask of her father a field: and she lighted
from off her ass; and Caleb said to her, What wilt thou?

<span id="an_1:15">1:15</span> And she said to him, Give me a blessing:
for thou hast given me a south land; give me also springs of water. And
Caleb gave her the upper springs, and the nether springs.

<span id="an_1:16">1:16</span> And the children of the Kenite, Moses's
father-in-law, went up out of the city of palm-trees with the children
of Judah into the wilderness of Judah, which lieth in the south of Arad;
and they went and dwelt among the people.

<span id="an_1:17">1:17</span> And Judah went with Simeon his brother,
and they slew the Canaanites that inhabited Zephath, and utterly
destroyed it. And the name of the city was called Hormah.

<span id="an_1:18">1:18</span> Also Judah took Gaza with its border, and
Askelon with its border, and Ekron with its border.

<span id="an_1:19">1:19</span> And the LORD was with Judah; and he drove
out the inhabitants of the mountain; but could not drive out the
inhabitants of the valley, because they had chariots of iron.

<span id="an_1:20">1:20</span> And they gave Hebron to Caleb, as Moses
said: and he expelled thence the three sons of Anak.

<span id="an_1:21">1:21</span> And the children of Benjamin did not
drive out the Jebusites that inhabited Jerusalem; but the Jebusites
dwell with the children of Benjamin in Jerusalem to this day.

<span id="an_1:22">1:22</span> And the house of Joseph, they also went
up against Beth-el: and the LORD was with them.

<span id="an_1:23">1:23</span> And the house of Joseph sent to explore
Beth-el. Now the name of the city before was Luz.

<span id="an_1:24">1:24</span> And the spies saw a man coming out of the
city, and they said to him, Show us, we pray thee, the entrance into the
city, and we will show thee mercy.

<span id="an_1:25">1:25</span> And when he showed them the entrance into
the city, they smote the city with the edge of the sword: but they let
go the man and all his family.

<span id="an_1:26">1:26</span> And the man went into the land of the
Hittites, and built a city, and called the name of it Luz: which is its
name to this day.

<span id="an_1:27">1:27</span> Neither did Manasseh expel the
inhabitants of Beth-shean and its towns, nor Tanach and its towns, nor
the inhabitants of Dor and its towns, nor the inhabitants of Ibleam and
its towns, nor the inhabitants of Megiddo and its towns; but the
Canaanites would dwell in that land.

<span id="an_1:28">1:28</span> And it came to pass when Israel was
strong, that they subjected the Canaanites to tribute, and did not
utterly expel them.

<span id="an_1:29">1:29</span> Neither did Ephraim expel the Canaanites
that dwelt in Gezer; but the Canaanites dwelt in Gezer among them.

<span id="an_1:30">1:30</span> Neither did Zebulun expel the inhabitants
of Kitron, nor the inhabitants of Nahalol; but the Canaanites dwelt
among them, and became tributaries.

<span id="an_1:31">1:31</span> Neither did Asher expel the inhabitants
of Accho, nor the inhabitants of Zidon, nor of Ahlab, nor of Achzib, nor
of Helbah, nor of Aphik, nor of Rehob:

<span id="an_1:32">1:32</span> But the Asherites dwelt among the
Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land: for they did not expel them.

<span id="an_1:33">1:33</span> Neither did Naphtali expel the
inhabitants of Beth-shemesh, nor the inhabitants of Beth-anath; but he
dwelt among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land: nevertheless,
the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh and of Beth-anath became tributaries to
them.

<span id="an_1:34">1:34</span> And the Amorites forced the children of
Dan to the mountain: for they would not suffer them to come down to the
valley:

<span id="an_1:35">1:35</span> But the Amorites would dwell in mount
Heres in Ajalon, and in Shaalbim: yet the hand of the house of Joseph
prevailed, so that they became tributaries.

<span id="an_1:36">1:36</span> And the border of the Amorites was from
the ascent to Akrabbim, from the rock, and upward.

<span id="an_2:1">2:1</span> And an angel of the LORD came up from
Gilgal to Bochim, and said, I made you to depart from Egypt, and have
brought you to the land which I swore to your fathers; and I said, I
will never break my covenant with you.

<span id="an_2:2">2:2</span> And ye shall make no league with the
inhabitants of this land; ye shall throw down their altars: but ye have
not obeyed my voice: why have ye done this?

<span id="an_2:3">2:3</span> Wherefore I also said, I will not drive
them out from before you; but they shall be as thorns in your sides, and
their gods shall be a snare to you.

<span id="an_2:4">2:4</span> And it came to pass, when the angel of the
LORD spoke these words to all the children of Israel, that the people
lifted up their voice, and wept.

<span id="an_2:5">2:5</span> And they called the name of that place
Bochim: and they sacrificed there to the LORD.

<span id="an_2:6">2:6</span> And when Joshua had let the people go, the
children of Israel went every man to his inheritance to possess the
land.

<span id="an_2:7">2:7</span> And the people served the LORD all the days
of Joshua, and all the days of the elders that outlived Joshua, who had
seen all the great works of the LORD, that he did for Israel.

<span id="an_2:8">2:8</span> And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of
the LORD, died, being a hundred and ten years old.

<span id="an_2:9">2:9</span> And they buried him in the border of his
inheritance in Timnath-heres, in the mount of Ephraim, on the north side
of the hill Gaash.

<span id="an_2:10">2:10</span> And also all that generation were
gathered to their fathers: and there arose another generation after
them, which knew not the LORD, nor yet the works which he had done for
Israel.

<span id="an_2:11">2:11</span> And the children of Israel did evil in
the sight of the LORD, and served Baalim:

<span id="an_2:12">2:12</span> And they forsook the LORD God of their
fathers, who brought them out of the land of Egypt, and followed other
gods, of the gods of the people that were around them, and bowed
themselves to them, and provoked the LORD to anger.

<span id="an_2:13">2:13</span> And they forsook the LORD, and served
Baal and Ashtaroth.

<span id="an_2:14">2:14</span> And the anger of the LORD was hot against
Israel, and he delivered them into the hands of spoilers that spoiled
them, and he sold them into the hands of their enemies around, so that
they could not any longer stand before their enemies.

<span id="an_2:15">2:15</span> Whithersoever they went out, the hand of
the LORD was against them for evil, as the LORD had said, and as the
LORD had sworn to them: and they were greatly distressed.

<span id="an_2:16">2:16</span> Nevertheless the LORD raised up judges,
who delivered them out of the hand of those that spoiled them.

<span id="an_2:17">2:17</span> And yet they would not hearken to their
judges, but they went astray after other gods, and bowed themselves to
them: they turned quickly out of the way which their fathers walked in,
obeying the commandments of the LORD; but they did not so.

<span id="an_2:18">2:18</span> And when the LORD raised up judges for
them, then the LORD was with the judge, and delivered them out of the
hand of their enemies all the days of the judge: (for the LORD repented
because of their groanings by reason of them that oppressed them and
burdened them.)

<span id="an_2:19">2:19</span> And it came to pass, when the judge was
dead, that they returned, and corrupted themselves more than their
fathers, in following other gods to serve them, and to bow down to them;
they ceased not from their own doings, nor from their stubborn way.

<span id="an_2:20">2:20</span> And the anger of the LORD was hot against
Israel; and he said, Because that this people hath transgressed my
covenant which I commanded their fathers, and have not hearkened to my
voice;

<span id="an_2:21">2:21</span> I also will not henceforth drive out from
before them any of the nations which Joshua left when he died:

<span id="an_2:22">2:22</span> That through them I may prove Israel,
whether they will keep the way of the LORD to walk in it, as their
fathers kept it, or not.

<span id="an_2:23">2:23</span> Therefore the LORD left those nations,
without driving them out speedily, neither did he deliver them into the
hand of Joshua.

<span id="an_3:1">3:1</span> Now these are the nations which the LORD
left, to prove Israel by them, (even as many of Israel as had not known
all the wars of Canaan;

<span id="an_3:2">3:2</span> Only that the generations of the children
of Israel might know to teach them war, at the least such as before knew
nothing of it;)

<span id="an_3:3">3:3</span> Namely, five lords of the Philistines, and
all the Canaanites, and the Sidonians, and the Hivites that dwelt on
mount Lebanon, from mount Baal-hermon to the entrance of Hamath.

<span id="an_3:4">3:4</span> And they were to prove Israel by them, to
know whether they would hearken to the commandments of the LORD, which
he commanded their fathers by the hand of Moses.

<span id="an_3:5">3:5</span> And the children of Israel dwelt among the
Canaanites, Hittites, and Amorites, and Perizzites, and Hivites, and
Jebusites:

<span id="an_3:6">3:6</span> And they took their daughters to be their
wives, and gave their daughters to their sons, and served their gods.

<span id="an_3:7">3:7</span> And the children of Israel did evil in the
sight of the LORD, and forgot the LORD their God, and served Baalim, and
the groves.

<span id="an_3:8">3:8</span> Therefore the anger of the LORD was hot
against Israel, and he sold them into the hand of Chushan-rishathaim
king of Mesopotamia: and the children of Israel served
Chushan-rishathaim eight years.

<span id="an_3:9">3:9</span> And when the children of Israel cried to
the LORD, the LORD raised up a deliverer to the children of Israel, who
delivered them, even Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother.

<span id="an_3:10">3:10</span> And the Spirit of the LORD came upon him,
and he judged Israel, and went out to war: and the LORD delivered
Chushan-rishathaim king of Mesopotamia into his hand; and his hand
prevailed against Chushan-rishathaim.

<span id="an_3:11">3:11</span> And the land had rest forty years: and
Othniel the son of Kenaz died.

<span id="an_3:12">3:12</span> And the children of Israel did evil again
in the sight of the LORD: and the LORD strengthened Eglon the king of
Moab against Israel, because they had done evil in the sight of the
LORD.

<span id="an_3:13">3:13</span> And he gathered to him the children of
Ammon and Amalek, and went and smote Israel, and possessed the city of
palm-trees.

<span id="an_3:14">3:14</span> So the children of Israel served Eglon
the king of Moab eighteen years.

<span id="an_3:15">3:15</span> But when the children of Israel cried to
the LORD, the LORD raised them up a deliverer, Ehud the son of Gera, a
Benjaminite, a man left-handed: and by him the children of Israel sent a
present to Eglon king of Moab.

<span id="an_3:16">3:16</span> But Ehud made him a dagger which had two
edges, of a cubit length; and he girded it under his raiment upon his
right thigh.

<span id="an_3:17">3:17</span> And he brought the present to Eglon king
of Moab: and Eglon was a very fat man.

<span id="an_3:18">3:18</span> And when he had made an end to offer the
present, he sent away the people that bore the present.

<span id="an_3:19">3:19</span> But he himself turned again from the
quarries that were by Gilgal, and said, I have a secret errand to thee,
O king: who said, Keep silence. And all that stood by him went out from
him.

<span id="an_3:20">3:20</span> And Ehud came to him; and he was sitting
in a summer-parlor, which he had for himself alone: and Ehud said, I
have a message from God to thee. And he arose from his seat.

<span id="an_3:21">3:21</span> And Ehud put forth his left hand, and
took the dagger from his right thigh, and thrust it into his belly:

<span id="an_3:22">3:22</span> And the haft also entered after the
blade: and the fat closed upon the blade, so that he could not draw the
dagger out of his belly; and the dirt came out.

<span id="an_3:23">3:23</span> Then Ehud went forth through the porch,
and shut the doors of the parlor upon him, and locked them.

<span id="an_3:24">3:24</span> When he had gone out, his servants came;
and when they saw that, behold, the doors of the parlor were locked,
they said, Surely he covereth his feet in his summer-chamber.

<span id="an_3:25">3:25</span> And they tarried till they were ashamed:
and behold, he opened not the doors of the parlor, therefore they took a
key and opened them: and behold, their lord lay dead on the earth.

<span id="an_3:26">3:26</span> And Ehud escaped while they tarried; and
passed beyond the quarries, and escaped to Seirath.

<span id="an_3:27">3:27</span> And it came to pass when he had come,
that he blew a trumpet in the mountain of Ephraim, and the children of
Israel went down with him from the mount, and he before them.

<span id="an_3:28">3:28</span> And he said to them, Follow me: for the
LORD hath delivered your enemies the Moabites into your hand. And they
went down after him, and took the fords of Jordan towards Moab, and
suffered not a man to pass over.

<span id="an_3:29">3:29</span> And they slew of Moab at that time about
ten thousand men, all lusty, and all men of valor: and there escaped not
a man.

<span id="an_3:30">3:30</span> So Moab was subdued that day under the
hand of Israel: and the land had rest eighty years.

<span id="an_3:31">3:31</span> And after him was Shamgar the son of
Anath, who slew of the Philistines six hundred men with an ox-goad; and
he also delivered Israel.

<span id="an_4:1">4:1</span> And the children of Israel again did evil
in the sight of the LORD, after Ehud was dead.

<span id="an_4:2">4:2</span> And the LORD sold them into the hand of
Jabin king of Canaan that reigned in Hazor, the captain of whose host
was Sisera, who dwelt in Harosheth of the Gentiles.

<span id="an_4:3">4:3</span> And the children of Israel cried to the
LORD; for he had nine hundred chariots of iron; and twenty years he
mightily oppressed the children of Israel.

<span id="an_4:4">4:4</span> And Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of
Lapidoth, she judged Israel at that time.

<span id="an_4:5">4:5</span> And she dwelt under the palm-tree of
Deborah, between Ramah and Beth-el in mount Ephraim: and the children of
Israel came up to her for judgment.

<span id="an_4:6">4:6</span> And she sent and called Barak the son of
Abinoam from Kedesh-naphtali, and said to him, Hath not the LORD God of
Israel commanded, saying, Go, and draw towards mount Tabor, and take
with thee ten thousand men of the children of Naphtali, and of the
children of Zebulun?

<span id="an_4:7">4:7</span> And I will draw to thee, to the river
Kishon, Sisera the captain of Jabin's army, with his chariots and his
multitude; and I will deliver him into thy hand.

<span id="an_4:8">4:8</span> And Barak said to her, if thou wilt go with
me, then I will go: but if thou wilt not go with me, then I will not go.

<span id="an_4:9">4:9</span> And she said, I will surely go with thee:
notwithstanding the journey that thou takest shall not be for thy honor;
for the LORD will sell Sisera into the hand of a woman. And Deborah
arose, and went with Barak to Kedesh.

<span id="an_4:10">4:10</span> And Barak called Zebulun and Naphtali to
Kedesh; and he went up with ten thousand men at his feet: and Deborah
went up with him.

<span id="an_4:11">4:11</span> Now Heber the Kenite, who was of the
children of Hobab the father-in-law of Moses, had severed himself from
the Kenites, and pitched his tent to the plain of Zaanaim, which is by
Kedesh.

<span id="an_4:12">4:12</span> And they showed Sisera that Barak the son
of Abinoam had gone up to mount Tabor.

<span id="an_4:13">4:13</span> And Sisera collected all his chariots,
even nine hundred chariots of iron, and all the people that were with
him, from Harosheth of the Gentiles to the river of Kishon.

<span id="an_4:14">4:14</span> And Deborah said to Barak, Arise, for
this is the day in which the LORD hath delivered Sisera into thy hand:
hath not the LORD gone out before thee? So Barak went down from mount
Tabor, and ten thousand men after him.

<span id="an_4:15">4:15</span> And the LORD discomfited Sisera, and all
his chariots, and all his host, with the edge of the sword before Barak;
so that Sisera alighted from his chariot, and fled away on his feet.

<span id="an_4:16">4:16</span> But Barak pursued the chariots, and the
host, to Harosheth of the Gentiles: and all the host of Sisera fell upon
the edge of the sword; and there was not a man left.

<span id="an_4:17">4:17</span> Howbeit, Sisera fled away on his feet to
the tent of Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite: for there was peace
between Jabin the king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite.

<span id="an_4:18">4:18</span> And Jael went out to meet Sisera, and
said to him, Turn in, my lord, turn in to me; fear not. And when he had
turned in to her into the tent, she covered him with a mantle.

<span id="an_4:19">4:19</span> And he said to her, Give me, I pray thee,
a little water to drink; for I am thirsty. And she opened a bottle of
milk, and gave him drink, and covered him.

<span id="an_4:20">4:20</span> Again he said to her, stand in the door
of the tent, and it shall be, when any man doth come and inquire of
thee, and say, Is there any man here? that thou shalt say, No.

<span id="an_4:21">4:21</span> Then Jael, Heber's wife, took a nail of
the tent, and took a hammer in her hand, and went softly to him, and
smote the nail into his temples, and fastened it into the ground: for he
was fast asleep, and weary. So he died.

<span id="an_4:22">4:22</span> And behold, as Barak pursued Sisera, Jael
came out to meet him, and said to him, Come, and I will show thee the
man whom thou seekest. And when he came into her tent, behold, Sisera
lay dead, and the nail was in his temples.

<span id="an_4:23">4:23</span> So God subdued on that day Jabin the king
of Canaan before the children of Israel.

<span id="an_4:24">4:24</span> And the hand of the children of Israel
prospered, and prevailed against Jabin the king of Canaan, until they
had destroyed Jabin king of Canaan.

<span id="an_5:1">5:1</span> Then sang Deborah and Barak the son of
Abinoam on that day, saying,

<span id="an_5:2">5:2</span> Praise ye the LORD for the avenging of
Israel, when the people willingly offered themselves.

<span id="an_5:3">5:3</span> Hear, O ye kings; give ear, O ye princes;
I, even I, will sing to the LORD; I will sing praise to the LORD God of
Israel.

<span id="an_5:4">5:4</span> LORD, when thou wentest out of Seir, when
thou marchedst out of the field of Edom, the earth trembled, and the
heavens dropped, the clouds also dropped water.

<span id="an_5:5">5:5</span> The mountains melted from before the LORD,
even that Sinai from before the LORD God of Israel.

<span id="an_5:6">5:6</span> In the days of Shamgar the son of Anath, in
the days of Jael, the highways were unoccupied, and the travelers walked
through by-ways.

<span id="an_5:7">5:7</span> The inhabitants of the villages ceased,
they ceased in Israel, until that I Deborah arose, that I arose a mother
in Israel.

<span id="an_5:8">5:8</span> They chose new gods; then was war in the
gates: was there a shield or spear seen among forty thousand in Israel?

<span id="an_5:9">5:9</span> My heart is towards the governors of Israel
that offered themselves willingly among the people: Bless ye the LORD.

<span id="an_5:10">5:10</span> Speak, ye that ride on white asses, ye
that sit in judgment, and walk by the way.

<span id="an_5:11">5:11</span> They that are delivered from the noise of
archers in the places of drawing water, there shall they rehearse the
righteous acts of the LORD, even the righteous acts towards the
inhabitants of his villages in Israel: then shall the people of the LORD
go down to the gates.

<span id="an_5:12">5:12</span> Awake, awake, Deborah; awake, awake,
utter a song: arise, Barak, and lead thy captivity captive, thou son of
Abinoam.

<span id="an_5:13">5:13</span> Then he made him that remaineth have
dominion over the nobles among the people: the LORD made me have
dominion over the mighty.

<span id="an_5:14">5:14</span> Out of Ephraim was there a root of them
against Amalek; after thee, Benjamin, among thy people; out of Machir
came down governors, and out of Zebulun they that handle the pen of the
writer.

<span id="an_5:15">5:15</span> And the princes of Issachar were with
Deborah: even Issachar, and also Barak: he was sent on foot into the
valley. For the divisions of Reuben there were great thoughts of heart.

<span id="an_5:16">5:16</span> Why abodest thou among the sheep-folds,
to hear the bleatings of the flocks? For the divisions of Reuben there
were great searchings of heart.

<span id="an_5:17">5:17</span> Gilead abode beyond Jordan: and why did
Dan remain in ships? Asher continued on the sea-shore, and abode in his
breaches.

<span id="an_5:18">5:18</span> Zebulun and Naphtali were a people that
jeoparded their lives to death in the high places of the field.

<span id="an_5:19">5:19</span> The kings came and fought, then fought
the kings of Canaan in Tanach by the waters of Megiddo; they took no
gain of money.

<span id="an_5:20">5:20</span> They fought from heaven; the stars in
their courses fought against Sisera.

<span id="an_5:21">5:21</span> The river of Kishon swept them away, that
ancient river, the river Kishon. O my soul, thou hast trodden down
strength.

<span id="an_5:22">5:22</span> Then were the horse's hoofs broken by the
means of the prancings, the prancings of their mighty ones.

<span id="an_5:23">5:23</span> Curse ye Meroz, said the angel of the
LORD, curse ye bitterly its inhabitants; because they came not to the
help of the LORD, to the help of the LORD against the mighty.

<span id="an_5:24">5:24</span> Blessed above women shall Jael the wife
of Heber the Kenite be, blessed shall she be above women in the tent.

<span id="an_5:25">5:25</span> He asked water, and she gave him milk;
she brought forth butter in a lordly dish.

<span id="an_5:26">5:26</span> She put her hand to the nail, and her
right hand to the workmen's hammer; and with the hammer she smote
Sisera, she smote off his head, when she had pierced and struck through
his temples.

<span id="an_5:27">5:27</span> At her feet he bowed, he fell, he lay
down: at her feet he bowed, he fell: where he bowed, there he fell down
dead.

<span id="an_5:28">5:28</span> The mother of Sisera looked out at a
window, and cried through the lattice, Why is his chariot so long in
coming? why tarry the wheels of his chariots?

<span id="an_5:29">5:29</span> Her wise ladies answered her, yes, she
returned answer to herself.

<span id="an_5:30">5:30</span> Have they not found; have they not
divided the prey; to every man a damsel or two; to Sisera a prey of
divers colors, a prey of divers colors of needle-work, of divers colors
of needle-work on both sides, meet for the necks of them that take the
spoil?

<span id="an_5:31">5:31</span> So let all thy enemies perish, O LORD:
but let them that love him be as the sun when he goeth forth in his
might. And the land had rest forty years.

<span id="an_6:1">6:1</span> And the children of Israel did evil in the
sight of the LORD: and the LORD delivered them into the hand of Midian
seven years.

<span id="an_6:2">6:2</span> And the hand of Midian prevailed against
Israel: and because of the Midianites the children of Israel made them
the dens which are in the mountains, and caves, and strong holds.

<span id="an_6:3">6:3</span> And so it was, when Israel had sown, that
the Midianites came up, and the Amalekites, and the children of the
east, even they came up against them;

<span id="an_6:4">6:4</span> And they encamped against them, and
destroyed the increase of the earth, till thou comest to Gaza; and left
no sustenance for Israel, neither sheep, nor ox, nor ass.

<span id="an_6:5">6:5</span> For they came up with their cattle, and
their tents, and they came as grasshoppers for multitude; for both they
and their camels were without number: and they entered into the land to
destroy it.

<span id="an_6:6">6:6</span> And Israel was greatly impoverished because
of the Midianites; and the children of Israel cried to the LORD.

<span id="an_6:7">6:7</span> And it came to pass, when the children of
Israel cried to the LORD because of the Midianites,

<span id="an_6:8">6:8</span> That the LORD sent a prophet to the
children of Israel, who said to them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel,
I brought you up from Egypt, and brought you forth from the house of
bondage;

<span id="an_6:9">6:9</span> And I delivered you from the hand of the
Egyptians, and from the hand of all that oppressed you, and drove them
out from before you, and gave you their land;

<span id="an_6:10">6:10</span> And I said to you, I am the LORD your
God; fear not the gods of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell: but ye
have not obeyed my voice.

<span id="an_6:11">6:11</span> And there came an angel of the LORD, and
sat under an oak which was in Ophrah, that pertained to Joash the
Abi-ezrite: and his son Gideon thrashed wheat by the wine-press, to hide
it from the Midianites.

<span id="an_6:12">6:12</span> And the angel of the LORD appeared to
him, and said to him, The LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valor.

<span id="an_6:13">6:13</span> And Gideon said to him, O my Lord, if the
LORD is with us, why then hath all this befallen us? and where are all
his miracles which our fathers told us of, saying, Did not the LORD
bring us up from Egypt? but now the LORD hath forsaken us, and delivered
us into the hands of the Midianites.

<span id="an_6:14">6:14</span> And the LORD looked upon him, and said,
Go in this thy might, and thou shalt save Israel from the hand of the
Midianites: have not I sent thee?

<span id="an_6:15">6:15</span> And he said to him, O my Lord, by what
means shall I save Israel? behold, my family is poor in Manasseh, and I
am the least in my father's house.

<span id="an_6:16">6:16</span> And the LORD said to him, Surely I will
be with thee, and thou shalt smite the Midianites as one man.

<span id="an_6:17">6:17</span> And he said to him, If now I have found
grace in thy sight, then show me a sign that thou talkest with me.

<span id="an_6:18">6:18</span> Depart not hence, I pray thee, until I
come to thee, and bring forth my present, and set it before thee. And he
said, I will tarry until thou comest again.

<span id="an_6:19">6:19</span> And Gideon went in, and made ready a kid,
and unleavened cakes of an ephah of flour: the flesh he put in a basket,
and he put the broth in a pot, and brought it out to him under the oak,
and presented it.

<span id="an_6:20">6:20</span> And the angel of God said to him, Take
the flesh and the unleavened cakes, and lay them upon this rock, and
pour out the broth. And he did so.

<span id="an_6:21">6:21</span> Then the angel of the LORD put forth the
end of the staff that was in his hand, and touched the flesh and the
unleavened cakes; and there rose fire out of the rock, and consumed the
flesh and the unleavened cakes. Then the angel of the LORD departed from
his sight.

<span id="an_6:22">6:22</span> And when Gideon perceived that he was an
angel of the LORD, Gideon said, Alas, O Lord GOD! for because I have
seen an angel of the LORD face to face.

<span id="an_6:23">6:23</span> And the LORD said to him, Peace be to
thee; fear not: thou shalt not die.

<span id="an_6:24">6:24</span> Then Gideon built an altar there to the
LORD, and called it Jehovah-shalom: to this day it is yet in Ophrah of
the Abi-ezrites.

<span id="an_6:25">6:25</span> And it came to pass the same night, that
the LORD said to him, Take thy father's young bullock, even the second
bullock of seven years old, and throw down the altar of Baal that thy
father hath, and cut down the grove that is by it:

<span id="an_6:26">6:26</span> And build an altar to the LORD thy God
upon the top of this rock, in the ordered place, and take the second
bullock, and offer a burnt-sacrifice with the wood of the grove which
thou shalt cut down.

<span id="an_6:27">6:27</span> Then Gideon took ten men of his servants,
and did as the LORD had said to him: and so it was, because he feared
his father's household, and the men of the city, that he could not do it
by day, that he did it by night.

<span id="an_6:28">6:28</span> And when the men of the city arose early
in the morning, behold, the altar of Baal was cast down, and the grove
was cut down that was by it, and the second bullock was offered upon the
altar that was built.

<span id="an_6:29">6:29</span> And they said one to another, Who hath
done this thing? And when they inquired and asked, they said, Gideon the
son of Joash hath done this thing.

<span id="an_6:30">6:30</span> Then the men of the city said to Joash,
Bring out thy son, that he may die: because he hath cast down the altar
of Baal, and because he hath cut down the grove that was by it.

<span id="an_6:31">6:31</span> And Joash said to all that stood against
him, Will ye plead for Baal? will ye save him? he that will plead for
him, let him be put to death whilst it is yet morning: if he is a god,
let him plead for himself, because one hath cast down his altar.

<span id="an_6:32">6:32</span> Therefore on that day he called him
Jerubbaal, saying, Let Baal plead against him, because he hath thrown
down his altar.

<span id="an_6:33">6:33</span> Then all the Midianites, and the
Amalekites, and the children of the east were assembled, and went over,
and encamped in the valley of Jezreel.

<span id="an_6:34">6:34</span> But the Spirit of the LORD came upon
Gideon, and he blew a trumpet; and Abiezer was called after him.

<span id="an_6:35">6:35</span> And he sent messengers throughout all
Manasseh; who also was called after him: and he sent messengers to
Asher, and to Zebulun, and to Naphtali; and they came up to meet them.

<span id="an_6:36">6:36</span> And Gideon said to God, If thou wilt save
Israel by my hand, as thou hast said,

<span id="an_6:37">6:37</span> Behold, I will put a fleece of wool on
the floor; and if the dew shall be on the fleece only, and it shall be
dry upon all the earth besides, then shall I know that thou wilt save
Israel by my hand, as thou hast said.

<span id="an_6:38">6:38</span> And it was so: for he rose early on the
morrow, and pressed the fleece, and wrung the dew out of the fleece, a
bowl-full of water.

<span id="an_6:39">6:39</span> And Gideon said to God, Let not thy anger
be hot against me, and I will speak but this once: Let me make trial, I
pray thee, but this once with the fleece; let it now be dry only upon
the fleece, and upon all the ground let there be dew.

<span id="an_6:40">6:40</span> And God did so that night: for it was dry
upon the fleece only, and there was dew on all the ground.

<span id="an_7:1">7:1</span> Then Jerubbaal (who is Gideon) and all the
people that were with him, rose early, and encamped beside the well of
Harod: so that the host of the Midianites were on the north side of them
by the hill of Moreh, in the valley.

<span id="an_7:2">7:2</span> And the LORD said to Gideon, The people
that are with thee are too many for me to give the Midianites into their
hands, lest Israel vaunt themselves against me, saying, My own hand hath
saved me.

<span id="an_7:3">7:3</span> Now therefore, proclaim in the ears of the
people, saying, Whoever is fearful and afraid, let him return and depart
early from mount Gilead. And there returned of the people twenty and two
thousand; and there remained ten thousand.

<span id="an_7:4">7:4</span> And the LORD said to Gideon, The people are
yet too many; bring them down to the water, and I will try them for thee
there; and it shall be, that of whom I say to thee, This shall go with
thee, the same shall go with thee; and of whomsoever I say to thee, This
shall not go with thee, the same shall not go.

<span id="an_7:5">7:5</span> So he brought down the people to the water:
and the LORD said to Gideon, Every one that lappeth of the water with
his tongue as a dog lappeth, him shalt thou set by himself; likewise
every one that boweth down upon his knees to drink.

<span id="an_7:6">7:6</span> And the number of them that lapped, putting
their hand to their mouth, were three hundred men: but all the rest of
the people bowed down upon their knees to drink water.

<span id="an_7:7">7:7</span> And the LORD said to Gideon, By the three
hundred men that lapped will I save you, and deliver the Midianites into
thy hand: and let all the other people go every man to his place.

<span id="an_7:8">7:8</span> So the people took victuals in their hand,
and their trumpets: and he sent of all the rest of Israel every man to
his tent, and retained those three hundred men. And the host of Midian
was beneath him in the valley.

<span id="an_7:9">7:9</span> And it came to pass the same night, that
the LORD said to him, Arise, go down to the host; for I have delivered
it into thy hand.

<span id="an_7:10">7:10</span> But if thou fearest to go down, go thou
with Phurah thy servant down to the host:

<span id="an_7:11">7:11</span> And thou shalt hear what they say; and
afterward shall thy hands be strengthened to go down to the host. Then
went he down with Phurah his servant to the outside of the armed men
that were in the host.

<span id="an_7:12">7:12</span> And the Midianites, and the Amalekites,
and all the children of the east, lay along in the valley like
grasshoppers for multitude; and their camels were without number, as the
sand by the sea side for multitude.

<span id="an_7:13">7:13</span> And when Gideon had come, behold, there
was a man that told a dream to his fellow, and said, Behold, I dreamed a
dream, and lo, a cake of barley-bread rolled into the host of Midian,
and came to a tent, and smote it that it fell, and overturned it that
the tent lay along.

<span id="an_7:14">7:14</span> And his fellow answered, and said, This
is nothing else save the sword of Gideon the son of Joash, a man of
Israel: for into his hand hath God delivered Midian, and all the host.

<span id="an_7:15">7:15</span> And it was so, when Gideon heard the
telling of the dream, and its interpretation, that he worshiped, and
returned to the host of Israel, and said, Arise; for the LORD hath
delivered into your hand the host of Midian.

<span id="an_7:16">7:16</span> And he divided the three hundred men into
three companies, and he put a trumpet in every man's hand, with empty
pitchers, and lamps within the pitchers.

<span id="an_7:17">7:17</span> And he said to them, Look on me, and do
likewise: and behold, when I come to the outside of the camp, it shall
be that as I do, so shall ye do.

<span id="an_7:18">7:18</span> When I blow with a trumpet, I and all
that are with me, then blow ye the trumpets also on every side of all
the camp, and say, The sword of the LORD, and of Gideon.

<span id="an_7:19">7:19</span> So Gideon, and the hundred men that were
with him, came to the outside of the camp in the beginning of the middle
watch; and they had but newly set the watch: and they blew the trumpets,
and broke the pitchers that were in their hands.

<span id="an_7:20">7:20</span> And the three companies blew the
trumpets, and broke the pitchers, and held the lamps in their left
hands, and the trumpets in their right hands to blow with: and they
cried, The sword of the LORD, and of Gideon.

<span id="an_7:21">7:21</span> And they stood every man in his place
around the camp; and all the host ran, and cried, and fled.

<span id="an_7:22">7:22</span> And the three hundred blew the trumpets,
and the LORD set every man's sword against his fellow, even throughout
all the host: and the host fled to Beth-shittah in Zereroth, and to the
border of Abel-meholah, to Tabbath.

<span id="an_7:23">7:23</span> And the men of Israel assembled out of
Naphtali, and out of Asher, and out of all Manasseh, and pursued the
Midianites.

<span id="an_7:24">7:24</span> And Gideon sent messengers throughout all
mount Ephraim, saying, Come down against the Midianites, and take before
them the waters to Beth-barah and Jordan. Then all the men of Ephraim
assembled, and took the waters to Beth-barah and Jordan.

<span id="an_7:25">7:25</span> And they took two princes of the
Midianites, Oreb and Zeeb; and they slew Oreb upon the rock Oreb, and
Zeeb they slew at the wine-press of Zeeb, and pursued Midian, and
brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon on the other side of
Jordan.

<span id="an_8:1">8:1</span> And the men of Ephraim said to him, Why
hast thou treated us thus, that thou calledst us not when thou wentest
to fight with the Midianites? and they chid with him sharply.

<span id="an_8:2">8:2</span> And he said to them, What have I done now
in comparison of you? Is not the gleaning of the grapes of Ephraim
better than the vintage of Abiezer?

<span id="an_8:3">8:3</span> God hath delivered into your hands the
princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb: and what was I able to do in
comparison of you? Then, when he had said that, their anger towards him
abated.

<span id="an_8:4">8:4</span> And Gideon came to Jordan, and passed over,
he, and the three hundred men that were with him, faint, yet pursuing
them.

<span id="an_8:5">8:5</span> And he said to the men of Succoth, Give, I
pray you, loaves of bread to the people that follow me: for they are
faint, and I am pursuing Zebah and Zalmunna, kings of Midian.

<span id="an_8:6">8:6</span> And the princes of Succoth said, Are the
hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in thy hand, that we should give bread
to thy army?

<span id="an_8:7">8:7</span> And Gideon said, Therefore when the LORD
hath delivered Zebah and Zalmunna into my hand, then I will tear your
flesh with the thorns of the wilderness and with briers.

<span id="an_8:8">8:8</span> And he went up thence to Penuel, and spoke
to them likewise: and the men of Penuel answered him as the men of
Succoth had answered him.

<span id="an_8:9">8:9</span> And he spoke also to the men of Penuel,
saying, When I come again in peace, I will break down this tower.

<span id="an_8:10">8:10</span> Now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor,
and their hosts with them, about fifteen thousand men, all that were
left of all the hosts of the children of the east: for there fell a
hundred and twenty thousand men that drew sword.

<span id="an_8:11">8:11</span> And Gideon went up by the way of them
that dwelt in tents on the east of Nobah and Jogbehah, and smote the
host: for the host was secure.

<span id="an_8:12">8:12</span> And when Zebah and Zalmunna fled, he
pursued them, and took the two kings of Midian, Zebah and Zalmunna, and
discomfited all the host.

<span id="an_8:13">8:13</span> And Gideon the son of Joash returned from
battle before the sun had risen,

<span id="an_8:14">8:14</span> And caught a young man of the men of
Succoth, and inquired of him: and he described to him the princes of
Succoth, and its elders, even seventy seven men.

<span id="an_8:15">8:15</span> And he came to the men of Succoth, and
said, Behold Zebah and Zalmunna, with whom ye upbraided me, saying, Are
the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in thy hand, that we should give
bread to thy men that are weary?

<span id="an_8:16">8:16</span> And he took the elders of the city, and
thorns of the wilderness, and briers, and with them he taught the men of
Succoth.

<span id="an_8:17">8:17</span> And he beat down the tower of Penuel, and
slew the men of the city.

<span id="an_8:18">8:18</span> Then said he to Zebah and Zalmunna, What
manner of men were they whom ye slew at Tabor? And they answered, As
thou art, so were they; each one resembled the children of a king.

<span id="an_8:19">8:19</span> And he said, They were my brethren, even
the sons of my mother: as the LORD liveth, if ye had saved them alive, I
would not slay you.

<span id="an_8:20">8:20</span> And he said to Jether his first-born,
Arise, and slay them. But the youth drew not his sword: for he feared,
because he was yet a youth.

<span id="an_8:21">8:21</span> Then Zebah and Zalmunna said, Rise thou,
and fall upon us: for as the man is, so is his strength. And Gideon
arose, and slew Zebah and Zalmunna, and took away the ornaments that
were on their camels' necks.

<span id="an_8:22">8:22</span> Then the men of Israel said to Gideon,
Rule thou over us, both thou, and thy son, and thy son's son also: for
thou hast delivered us from the hand of Midian.

<span id="an_8:23">8:23</span> And Gideon said to them, I will not rule
over you, neither shall my son rule over you: the LORD shall rule over
you.

<span id="an_8:24">8:24</span> And Gideon said to them, I would desire a
request of you, that you would give me every man the ear-rings of his
prey. (For they had golden ear-rings, because they were Ishmaelites.)

<span id="an_8:25">8:25</span> And they answered, We will willingly give
them. And they spread a garment, and cast into it every man the
ear-rings of his prey.

<span id="an_8:26">8:26</span> And the weight of the golden ear-rings
that he requested, was a thousand and seven hundred shekels of gold;
besides ornaments, and collars, and purple raiment that was on the kings
of Midian, and besides the chains that were about their camels' necks.

<span id="an_8:27">8:27</span> And Gideon made of it an ephod, and put
it in his city, even in Ophrah: and all Israel went thither astray after
it: which thing became a snare to Gideon, and to his house.

<span id="an_8:28">8:28</span> Thus was Midian subdued before the
children of Israel, so that they raised their heads no more. And the
country was in quietness forty years in the days of Gideon.

<span id="an_8:29">8:29</span> And Jerubbaal the son of Joash went and
dwelt in his own house.

<span id="an_8:30">8:30</span> And Gideon had seventy sons of his body
begotten: for he had many wives.

<span id="an_8:31">8:31</span> And his concubine that was in Shechem,
she also bore him a son, whose name he called Abimelech.

<span id="an_8:32">8:32</span> And Gideon the son of Joash died in a
good old age, and was buried in the sepulcher of Joash his father, in
Ophrah of the Abi-ezrites.

<span id="an_8:33">8:33</span> And it came to pass as soon as Gideon was
dead, that the children of Israel turned again, and went astray after
Baalim, and made Baal-berith their god.

<span id="an_8:34">8:34</span> And the children of Israel remembered not
the LORD their God, who had delivered them from the hands of all their
enemies on every side:

<span id="an_8:35">8:35</span> Neither showed they kindness to the house
of Jerubbaal, namely Gideon, according to all the goodness which he had
shown to Israel.

<span id="an_9:1">9:1</span> And Abimelech the son of Jerubbaal went to
Shechem to his mother's brethren, and communed with them, and with all
the family of the house of his mother's father, saying,

<span id="an_9:2">9:2</span> Speak, I pray you, in the ears of all the
men of Shechem, Which is better for you, either that all the sons of
Jerubbaal, which are seventy persons, should reign over you, or that one
should reign over you? remember also that I am your bone and your flesh.

<span id="an_9:3">9:3</span> And his mother's brethren spoke of him in
the ears of all the men of Shechem all these words: and their hearts
inclined to follow Abimelech; for they said, He is our brother.

<span id="an_9:4">9:4</span> And they gave him seventy pieces of silver
out of the house of Baal-berith, with which Abimelech hired vain and
light persons, who followed him.

<span id="an_9:5">9:5</span> And he went to his father's house at
Ophrah, and slew his brethren the sons of Jerubbaal, being seventy
persons, upon one stone; notwithstanding, yet Jotham the youngest son of
Jerubbaal was left; for he hid himself.

<span id="an_9:6">9:6</span> And all the men of Shechem assembled, and
all the house of Millo, and went and made Abimelech king, by the plain
of the pillar that was in Shechem.

<span id="an_9:7">9:7</span> And when they told it to Jotham, he went
and stood in the top of mount Gerizim, and lifted up his voice and
cried, and said to them, Hearken to me, ye men of Shechem, that God may
hearken to you.

<span id="an_9:8">9:8</span> The trees went forth on a time to anoint a
king over them; and they said to the olive-tree, Reign thou over us.

<span id="an_9:9">9:9</span> But the olive-tree said to them, Should I
leave my fatness, with which by me they honor God and man, and go to be
promoted over the trees?

<span id="an_9:10">9:10</span> And the trees said to the fig-tree, Come
thou, and reign over us.

<span id="an_9:11">9:11</span> But the fig-tree said to them, Should I
forsake my sweetness, and my good fruit, and go to be promoted over the
trees?

<span id="an_9:12">9:12</span> Then said the trees to the vine, Come
thou, and reign over us.

<span id="an_9:13">9:13</span> And the vine said to them, Should I leave
my wine, which cheereth God and man, and go to be promoted over the
trees?

<span id="an_9:14">9:14</span> Then said all the trees to the bramble,
Come thou, and reign over us.

<span id="an_9:15">9:15</span> And the bramble said to the trees, If in
truth ye anoint me king over you, then come and put your trust in my
shadow: and if not, let fire come out of the bramble, and devour the
cedars of Lebanon.

<span id="an_9:16">9:16</span> Now therefore, if ye have done truly and
sincerely, in that ye have made Abimelech king, and if ye have dealt
well with Jerubbaal and his house, and have done to him according to the
deserving of his hands:

<span id="an_9:17">9:17</span> (For my father fought for you, and
adventured his life far, and delivered you from the hand of Midian:

<span id="an_9:18">9:18</span> And ye have risen up against my father's
house this day, and have slain his sons, seventy persons, upon one
stone, and have made Abimelech, the son of his maid-servant, king over
the men of Shechem, because he is your brother:)

<span id="an_9:19">9:19</span> If ye then have dealt truly and sincerely
with Jerubbaal and with his house this day, then rejoice ye in
Abimelech, and let him also rejoice in you:

<span id="an_9:20">9:20</span> But if not, let fire come out from
Abimelech, and devour the men of Shechem, and the house of Millo; and
let fire come out from the men of Shechem, and from the house of Millo,
and devour Abimelech.

<span id="an_9:21">9:21</span> And Jotham ran away, and fled, and went
to Beer, and dwelt there, for fear of Abimelech his brother.

<span id="an_9:22">9:22</span> When Abimelech had reigned three years
over Israel,

<span id="an_9:23">9:23</span> Then God sent an evil spirit between
Abimelech and the men of Shechem; and the men of Shechem dealt
treacherously with Abimelech:

<span id="an_9:24">9:24</span> That the cruelty done to the seventy sons
of Jerubbaal might come, and their blood be laid upon Abimelech their
brother who slew them, and upon the men of Shechem who aided him in the
killing of his brethren.

<span id="an_9:25">9:25</span> And the men of Shechem set liers in wait
for him on the top of the mountains, and they robbed all that came along
that way by them: and it was told Abimelech.

<span id="an_9:26">9:26</span> And Gaal the son of Ebed came with his
brethren, and went over to Shechem: and the men of Shechem put their
confidence in him.

<span id="an_9:27">9:27</span> And they went out into the fields, and
gathered their vineyards, and trod the grapes, and made merry, and went
into the house of their god, and ate and drank, and cursed Abimelech.

<span id="an_9:28">9:28</span> And Gaal the son of Ebed said, Who is
Abimelech, and who is Shechem, that we should serve him; is not he the
son of Jerubbaal? and Zebul his officer? Serve the men of Hamor the
father of Shechem: for why should we serve him?

<span id="an_9:29">9:29</span> And would that this people were under my
hand! then would I remove Abimelech. And he said to Abimelech, Increase
thy army, and come out.

<span id="an_9:30">9:30</span> And when Zebul the ruler of the city
heard the words of Gaal the son of Ebed, his anger was kindled.

<span id="an_9:31">9:31</span> And he sent messengers to Abimelech
privately, saying, Behold, Gaal the son of Ebed, and his brethren, are
come to Shechem; and behold, they fortify the city against thee.

<span id="an_9:32">9:32</span> Now therefore rise by night, thou, and
the people that are with thee, and lie in wait in the field:

<span id="an_9:33">9:33</span> And it shall be, that in the morning, as
soon as the sun hath risen, thou shalt rise early, and attack the city:
and behold, when he and the people that are with him come out against
thee, then mayest thou do to them as thou shalt find occasion.

<span id="an_9:34">9:34</span> And Abimelech rose, and all the people
that were with him, by night, and they laid wait against Shechem in four
companies.

<span id="an_9:35">9:35</span> And Gaal the son of Ebed went out, and
stood in the entrance of the gate of the city: and Abimelech rose, and
the people that were with him, from lying in wait.

<span id="an_9:36">9:36</span> And when Gaal saw the people, he said to
Zebul, Behold, there come people down from the top of the mountains. And
Zebul said to him, Thou seest the shadow of the mountains as if they
were men.

<span id="an_9:37">9:37</span> And Gaal spoke again, and said, See,
there come people down by the middle of the land, and another company
come along by the plain of Meonenim.

<span id="an_9:38">9:38</span> Then said Zebul to him, Where is now thy
mouth, with which thou saidst, Who is Abimelech, that we should serve
him? are not these the people that thou hast despised? go out, I pray
now, and fight with them.

<span id="an_9:39">9:39</span> And Gaal went out before the men of
Shechem, and fought with Abimelech.

<span id="an_9:40">9:40</span> And Abimelech chased him, and he fled
before him, and many were overthrown and wounded, even to the entrance
of the gate.

<span id="an_9:41">9:41</span> And Abimelech dwelt at Arumah: and Zebul
thrust out Gaal and his brethren, that they should not dwell in Shechem.

<span id="an_9:42">9:42</span> And it came to pass on the morrow, that
the people went out into the field; and they told Abimelech.

<span id="an_9:43">9:43</span> And he took the people, and divided them
into three companies, and laid wait in the field, and looked, and
behold, the people had come out of the city; and he rose up against
them, and smote them.

<span id="an_9:44">9:44</span> And Abimelech, and the company that was
with him, rushed forward, and stood in the entrance of the gate of the
city: and the two other companies ran upon all the people that were in
the fields, and slew them.

<span id="an_9:45">9:45</span> And Abimelech fought against the city all
that day; and he took the city, and slew the people that were in it, and
beat down the city, and sowed it with salt.

<span id="an_9:46">9:46</span> And when all the men of the tower of
Shechem heard that, they entered into a hold of the house of the god
Berith.

<span id="an_9:47">9:47</span> And it was told to Abimelech, that all
the men of the tower of Shechem were assembled.

<span id="an_9:48">9:48</span> And Abimelech ascended mount Zalmon, he
and all the people that were with him; and Abimelech took an ax in his
hand, and cut down a bough from the trees, and took it, and laid it on
his shoulder, and said to the people that were with him, What ye have
seen me do, make haste, and do as I have done.

<span id="an_9:49">9:49</span> And all the people likewise cut down
every man his bough, and followed Abimelech, and put them to the hold,
and set the hold on fire upon them: so that all the men of the tower of
Shechem died also, about a thousand men and women.

<span id="an_9:50">9:50</span> Then went Abimelech to Thebez, and
encamped against Thebez, and took it.

<span id="an_9:51">9:51</span> But there was a strong tower within the
city, and thither fled all the men and women, and all they of the city,
and shut it after them, and ascended to the top of the tower.

<span id="an_9:52">9:52</span> And Abimelech came to the tower, and
fought against it, and came near to the door of the tower to burn it
with fire.

<span id="an_9:53">9:53</span> And a certain woman cast a piece of of a
millstone upon Abimelech's head, and broke his skull.

<span id="an_9:54">9:54</span> Then he called hastily to the young man
his armor-bearer, and said to him, Draw thy sword, and slay me, that men
say not of me, A woman slew him. And his young man thrust him through,
and he died.

<span id="an_9:55">9:55</span> And when the men of Israel saw that
Abimelech was dead, they departed every man to his place.

<span id="an_9:56">9:56</span> Thus God rendered the wickedness of
Abimelech, which he did to his father, in slaying his seventy brethren:

<span id="an_9:57">9:57</span> And all the evil of the men of Shechem
did God render upon their heads: and upon them came the curse of Jotham
the son of Jerubbaal.

<span id="an_10:1">10:1</span> And after Abimelech there arose to defend
Israel Tola the son of Puah, the son of Dodo, a man of Issachar; and he
dwelt in Shamir in mount Ephraim.

<span id="an_10:2">10:2</span> And he judged Israel twenty and three
years, and died, and was buried in Shamir.

<span id="an_10:3">10:3</span> And after him arose Jair, a Gileadite,
and judged Israel twenty and two years.

<span id="an_10:4">10:4</span> And he had thirty sons that rode on
thirty ass colts, and they had thirty cities, which are called
Havoth-jair to this day, which are in the land of Gilead.

<span id="an_10:5">10:5</span> And Jair died, and was buried in Camon.

<span id="an_10:6">10:6</span> And the children of Israel did evil again
in the sight of the LORD, and served Baalim, and Ashtaroth, and the gods
of Syria, and the gods of Zidon, and the gods of Moab, and the gods of
the children of Ammon, and the gods of the Philistines, and forsook the
LORD, and served not him.

<span id="an_10:7">10:7</span> And the anger of the LORD was hot against
Israel, and he sold them into the hands of the Philistines, and into the
hands of the children of Ammon.

<span id="an_10:8">10:8</span> And that year they harassed and oppressed
the children of Israel eighteen years, all the children of Israel that
were on the other side of Jordan in the land of the Amorites, which is
in Gilead.

<span id="an_10:9">10:9</span> Moreover, the children of Ammon passed
over Jordan, to fight also against Judah, and against Benjamin, and
against the house of Ephraim; so that Israel was greatly distressed.

<span id="an_10:10">10:10</span> And the children of Israel cried to the
LORD, saying, We have sinned against thee, both because we have forsaken
our God, and also served Baalim.

<span id="an_10:11">10:11</span> And the LORD said to the children of
Israel, Did not I deliver you from the Egyptians, and from the Amorites,
from the children of Ammon, and from the Philistines?

<span id="an_10:12">10:12</span> The Zidonians also, and the Amalekites,
and the Maonites oppressed you; and ye cried to me, and I delivered you
out of their hand.

<span id="an_10:13">10:13</span> Yet ye have forsaken me, and served
other gods: wherefore I will deliver you no more.

<span id="an_10:14">10:14</span> Go and cry to the gods which ye have
chosen; let them deliver you in the time of your tribulation.

<span id="an_10:15">10:15</span> And the children of Israel said to the
LORD, We have sinned: do thou to us whatever seemeth good to thee;
deliver us only, we pray thee, this day.

<span id="an_10:16">10:16</span> And they put away the strange gods from
among them, and served the LORD: and his soul was grieved for the misery
of Israel.

<span id="an_10:17">10:17</span> Then the children of Ammon were
assembled, and encamped in Gilead. And the children of Israel assembled
themselves, and encamped in Mizpeh.

<span id="an_10:18">10:18</span> And the people and princes of Gilead
said one to another, What man is he that will begin to fight against the
children of Ammon? he shall be head over all the inhabitants of Gilead.

<span id="an_11:1">11:1</span> Now Jephthah the Gileadite was a mighty
man of valor, and he was the son of a harlot: and Gilead begat Jephthah.

<span id="an_11:2">11:2</span> And Gilead's wife bore him sons; and his
wife's sons grew up, and they thrust out Jephthah, and said to him, Thou
shalt not inherit in our father's house; for thou art the son of a
strange woman.

<span id="an_11:3">11:3</span> Then Jephthah fled from his brethren, and
dwelt in the land of Tob: and there were gathered vain men to Jephthah,
and they went out with him.

<span id="an_11:4">11:4</span> And it came to pass in process of time,
that the children of Ammon made war against Israel.

<span id="an_11:5">11:5</span> And it was so, that when the children of
Ammon made war against Israel, the elders of Gilead went to bring
Jephthah out of the land of Tob:

<span id="an_11:6">11:6</span> And they said to Jephthah, Come, and be
our captain, that we may fight with the children of Ammon.

<span id="an_11:7">11:7</span> And Jephthah said to the elders of
Gilead, Did ye not hate me, and expel me from my father's house; and why
have ye come to me now when ye are in distress?

<span id="an_11:8">11:8</span> And the elders of Gilead said to
Jephthah, Therefore we turn again to thee now, that thou mayest go with
us, and fight against the children of Ammon, and be our head over all
the inhabitants of Gilead.

<span id="an_11:9">11:9</span> And Jephthah said to the elders of
Gilead, If ye bring me home again to fight against the children of
Ammon, and the LORD deliver them before me, shall I be your head?

<span id="an_11:10">11:10</span> And the elders of Gilead said to
Jephthah, The LORD be a witness between us, if we do not so according to
thy words.

<span id="an_11:11">11:11</span> Then Jephthah went with the elders of
Gilead, and the people made him head and captain over them: and Jephthah
uttered all his words before the LORD in Mizpeh.

<span id="an_11:12">11:12</span> And Jephthah sent messengers to the
king of the children of Ammon, saying, What hast thou to do with me,
that thou hast come against me to fight in my land?

<span id="an_11:13">11:13</span> And the king of the children of Ammon
answered to the messengers of Jephthah, Because Israel took away my
land, when they came out of Egypt, from Arnon even to Jabbok, and to
Jordan: now therefore restore those lands again peaceably.

<span id="an_11:14">11:14</span> And Jephthah sent messengers again to
the king of the children of Ammon:

<span id="an_11:15">11:15</span> And said to him, Thus saith Jephthah,
Israel took not away the land of Moab, nor the land of the children of
Ammon:

<span id="an_11:16">11:16</span> But when Israel came up from Egypt, and
walked through the wilderness to the Red sea, and came to Kadesh;

<span id="an_11:17">11:17</span> Then Israel sent messengers to the king
of Edom, saying, Let me, I pray thee, pass through thy land: but the
king of Edom would not hearken to it. And in like manner they sent to
the king of Moab; but he would not consent. And Israel abode in Kadesh.

<span id="an_11:18">11:18</span> Then they went along through the
wilderness, and compassed the land of Edom, and the land of Moab, and
came by the east side of the land of Moab, and pitched on the other side
of Arnon, but came not within the border of Moab: for Arnon was the
border of Moab.

<span id="an_11:19">11:19</span> And Israel sent messengers to Sihon
king of the Amorites, the king of Heshbon; and Israel said to him, Let
us pass, we pray thee, through thy land to my place.

<span id="an_11:20">11:20</span> But Sihon trusted not Israel to pass
through his border: but Sihon collected all his people, and encamped in
Jahaz, and fought against Israel.

<span id="an_11:21">11:21</span> And the LORD God of Israel delivered
Sihon and all his people into the hand of Israel, and they smote them:
so Israel possessed all the land of the Amorites, the inhabitants of
that country.

<span id="an_11:22">11:22</span> And they possessed all the borders of
the Amorites, from Arnon even to Jabbok, and from the wilderness even to
Jordan.

<span id="an_11:23">11:23</span> So now the LORD God of Israel hath
dispossessed the Amorites from before his people Israel, and shouldst
thou possess it?

<span id="an_11:24">11:24</span> Wilt not thou possess that which
Chemosh thy god giveth thee to possess? So whomsoever the LORD our God
shall drive out from before us, them will we possess.

<span id="an_11:25">11:25</span> And now art thou any thing better than
Balak the son of Zippor king of Moab? did he ever strive against Israel,
or did he ever fight against them,

<span id="an_11:26">11:26</span> While Israel dwelt in Heshbon and her
towns, and in Aroer and her towns, and in all the cities that are along
by the borders of Arnon, three hundred years? why therefore did ye not
recover them within that time?

<span id="an_11:27">11:27</span> Wherefore I have not sinned against
thee, but thou doest me wrong to war against me: the LORD the Judge be
judge this day between the children of Israel and the children of Ammon.

<span id="an_11:28">11:28</span> But, the king of the children of Ammon
hearkened not to the words of Jephthah which he sent him.

<span id="an_11:29">11:29</span> Then the Spirit of the LORD came upon
Jephthah, and he passed over Gilead, and Manasseh, and passed over
Mizpeh of Gilead, and from Mizpeh of Gilead he passed over to the
children of Ammon.

<span id="an_11:30">11:30</span> And Jephthah vowed a vow to the LORD,
and said, If thou shalt without fail deliver the children of Ammon into
my hands,

<span id="an_11:31">11:31</span> Then it shall be, that whatever cometh
out of the doors of my house to meet me, when I return in peace from the
children of Ammon, shall surely be the LORD'S, and I will offer it for a
burnt-offering.

<span id="an_11:32">11:32</span> So Jephthah passed over to the children
of Ammon to fight against them; and the LORD delivered them into his
hands.

<span id="an_11:33">11:33</span> And he smote them from Aroer even till
thou comest to Minnith, even twenty cities, and to the plain of the
vineyards, with a very great slaughter. Thus the children of Ammon were
subdued before the children of Israel.

<span id="an_11:34">11:34</span> And Jephthah came to Mizpeh to his
house, and behold, his daughter came out to meet him with timbrels and
with dances: and she was his only child; beside her he had neither son
nor daughter.

<span id="an_11:35">11:35</span> And it came to pass, when he saw her,
that he rent his clothes, and said Alas, my daughter! thou hast brought
me very low, and thou art one of them that trouble me: for I have opened
my mouth to the LORD, and I cannot go back.

<span id="an_11:36">11:36</span> And she said to him, My father, if thou
hast opened thy mouth to the LORD, do to me according to that which hath
proceeded out of thy mouth; forasmuch as the LORD hath taken vengeance
for thee of thy enemies, even of the children of Ammon.

<span id="an_11:37">11:37</span> And she said to her father, Let this
thing be done for me: Let me alone two months, that I may go up and down
upon the mountains, and bewail my virginity, I and my fellows.

<span id="an_11:38">11:38</span> And he said, Go. And he sent her away
for two months: and she went with her companions, and bewailed her
virginity upon the mountains.

<span id="an_11:39">11:39</span> And it came to pass at the end of two
months, that she returned to her father, who did with her according to
his vow which he had vowed: and she knew no man. And it was a custom in
Israel,

<span id="an_11:40">11:40</span> That the daughters of Israel went
yearly to lament the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite four days in a
year.

<span id="an_12:1">12:1</span> And the men of Ephraim assembled, and
went northward, and said to Jephthah, Why didst thou pass over to fight
against the children of Ammon, and didst not call us to go with thee; we
will burn thy house upon thee with fire.

<span id="an_12:2">12:2</span> And Jephthah said to them, I and my
people were at great strife with the children of Ammon; and when I
called you, ye delivered me not out of their hands.

<span id="an_12:3">12:3</span> And when I saw that ye delivered me not,
I put my life in my hands, and passed over against the children of
Ammon, and the LORD delivered them into my hand: why then have ye come
up to me this day, to fight against me?

<span id="an_12:4">12:4</span> Then Jephthah collected all the men of
Gilead, and fought with Ephraim: and the men of Gilead smote Ephraim,
because they said, Ye Gileadites are fugitives of Ephraim among the
Ephraimites, and among the Manassites.

<span id="an_12:5">12:5</span> And the Gileadites took the passages of
Jordan before the Ephraimites: and it was so, that when those
Ephraimites who had escaped, said, Let me go over; that the men of
Gilead said to him, Art thou an Ephraimite? If he said, No;

<span id="an_12:6">12:6</span> Then said they to him, Say now
Shibboleth: and he said Sibboleth: for he could not frame to pronounce
it right. Then they took him, and slew him at the passages of Jordan.
And there fell at that time of the Ephraimites forty and two thousand.

<span id="an_12:7">12:7</span> And Jephthah judged Israel six years:
then died Jephthah the Gileadite, and was buried in one of the cities of
Gilead.

<span id="an_12:8">12:8</span> And after him Ibzan of Beth-lehem judged
Israel.

<span id="an_12:9">12:9</span> And he had thirty sons and thirty
daughters whom he sent abroad, and took in thirty daughters from abroad
for his sons: and he judged Israel seven years.

<span id="an_12:10">12:10</span> Then died Ibzan, and was buried at
Beth-lehem.

<span id="an_12:11">12:11</span> And after him Elon, a Zebulonite,
judged Israel, and he judged Israel ten years.

<span id="an_12:12">12:12</span> And Elon the Zebulonite died, and was
buried in Ajalon in the country of Zebulun.

<span id="an_12:13">12:13</span> And after him Abdon the son of Hillel,
a Pirathonite, judged Israel.

<span id="an_12:14">12:14</span> And he had forty sons and thirty
nephews, that rode on seventy ass colts: and he judged Israel eight
years.

<span id="an_12:15">12:15</span> And Abdon the son of Hillel the
Pirathonite died, and was buried in Pirathon in the land of Ephraim, in
the mount of the Amalekites.

<span id="an_13:1">13:1</span> And the children of Israel did evil again
in the sight of the LORD; and the LORD delivered them into the hand of
the Philistines forty years.

<span id="an_13:2">13:2</span> And there was a certain man of Zorah, of
the family of the Danites, whose name was Manoah; and his wife was
barren, and bore not.

<span id="an_13:3">13:3</span> And the angel of the LORD appeared to the
woman, and said to her, Behold, now, thou art barren, and bearest not:
but thou shalt conceive, and bear a son.

<span id="an_13:4">13:4</span> Now therefore beware, I pray thee, and
drink not wine, nor strong drink, and eat not any unclean thing:

<span id="an_13:5">13:5</span> For lo, thou shalt conceive, and bear a
son; and no razor shall come on his head: for the child shall be a
Nazarite to God from his birth: and he shall begin to deliver Israel
from the hand of the Philistines.

<span id="an_13:6">13:6</span> Then the woman came and told her husband,
saying, A man of God came to me, and his countenance was like the
countenance of an angel of God, very terrible: but I asked him not
whence he was, neither did he tell me his name:

<span id="an_13:7">13:7</span> But he said to me, Behold, thou shalt
conceive, and bear a son; and now drink no wine nor strong drink,
neither eat any unclean thing: for the child shall be a Nazarite to God
from his birth to the day of his death.

<span id="an_13:8">13:8</span> Then Manoah entreated the LORD, and said,
O my Lord, let the man of God, whom thou didst send come again to us,
and teach us what we shall do to the child that shall be born.

<span id="an_13:9">13:9</span> And God hearkened to the voice of Manoah;
and the angel of God came again to the woman as she sat in the field:
but Manoah her husband was not with her.

<span id="an_13:10">13:10</span> And the woman made haste, and ran, and
showed her husband, and said to him, Behold, the man hath appeared to
me, that came to me the other day.

<span id="an_13:11">13:11</span> And Manoah arose, and went after his
wife, and came to the man, and said to him, Art thou the man that didst
speak to the woman? And he said, I am.

<span id="an_13:12">13:12</span> And Manoah said, Now let thy words come
to pass. How shall we order the child, and how shall we do to him?

<span id="an_13:13">13:13</span> And the angel of the LORD said to
Manoah, Of all that I said to the woman, let her beware.

<span id="an_13:14">13:14</span> She may not eat of any thing that
cometh of the vine, neither let her drink wine or strong drink, nor eat
any unclean thing; all that I commanded her let her observe.

<span id="an_13:15">13:15</span> And Manoah said to the angel of the
LORD, I pray thee, let us detain thee, until we shall have made ready a
kid for thee.

<span id="an_13:16">13:16</span> And the angel of the LORD said to
Manoah, Though thou shouldst detain me, I will not eat of thy bread: and
if thou wilt offer a burnt-offering, thou must offer it to the LORD. For
Manoah knew not that he was an angel of the LORD.

<span id="an_13:17">13:17</span> And Manoah said to the angel of the
LORD, What is thy name, that when thy sayings come to pass, we may do
thee honor?

<span id="an_13:18">13:18</span> And the angel of the LORD said to him,
why askest thou thus after my name, seeing it is secret?

<span id="an_13:19">13:19</span> So Manoah took a kid, with a
meat-offering, and offered it upon a rock to the LORD; and the angel did
wonderously, and Manoah and his wife looked on.

<span id="an_13:20">13:20</span> For it came to pass, when the flame
ascended towards heaven from off the altar, that the angel of the LORD
ascended in the flame of the altar. And Manoah and his wife looked on
it, and fell on their faces to the ground.

<span id="an_13:21">13:21</span> But the angel of the LORD did no more
appear to Manoah and to his wife. Then Manoah knew that he was an angel
of the LORD.

<span id="an_13:22">13:22</span> And Manoah said to his wife, We shall
surely die, because we have seen God.

<span id="an_13:23">13:23</span> But his wife said to him, If the LORD
were pleased to kill us, he would not have received a burnt-offering and
a meat-offering at our hands, neither would he have showed us all these
things, nor would, as at this time, have told us such things as these.

<span id="an_13:24">13:24</span> And the woman bore a son, and called
his name Samson. And the child grew, and the LORD blessed him.

<span id="an_13:25">13:25</span> And the Spirit of the LORD began to
move him at times in the camp of Dan, between Zorah and Eshtaol.

<span id="an_14:1">14:1</span> And Samson went down to Timnath, and saw
a woman in Timnath of the daughters of the Philistines.

<span id="an_14:2">14:2</span> And he came up, and told his father and
his mother, and said, I have seen a woman in Timnath of the daughters of
the Philistines: now therefore get her for me for a wife.

<span id="an_14:3">14:3</span> Then his father and his mother said to
him, Is there not a woman among the daughters of thy brethren, or among
all my people, that thou goest to take a wife of the uncircumcised
Philistines? And Samson said to his father, Get her for me; for she
pleaseth me well.

<span id="an_14:4">14:4</span> But his father and his mother knew not
that it was of the LORD, that he sought an occasion against the
Philistines: for at that time the Philistines had dominion over Israel.

<span id="an_14:5">14:5</span> Then went Samson down, and his father and
his mother, to Timnath, and came to the vineyards of Timnath: and
behold, a young lion roared against him.

<span id="an_14:6">14:6</span> And the Spirit of the LORD came mightily
upon him, and he rent him as he would have rent a kid, and he had
nothing in his hand: but he told not his father or his mother what he
had done.

<span id="an_14:7">14:7</span> And he went down, and talked with the
woman; and she pleased Samson well.

<span id="an_14:8">14:8</span> And after a time he returned to take her,
and he turned aside to see the carcass of the lion: and behold, there
was a swarm of bees and honey in the carcass of the lion.

<span id="an_14:9">14:9</span> And he took of it in his hands, and went
on eating, and came to his father and mother, and he gave them, and they
ate: but he told them not that he had taken the honey out of the carcass
of the lion.

<span id="an_14:10">14:10</span> So his father went down to the woman:
and Samson made there a feast; for so used the young men to do.

<span id="an_14:11">14:11</span> And it came to pass, when they saw him,
that they brought thirty companions to be with him.

<span id="an_14:12">14:12</span> And Samson said to them, I will now
propose a riddle to you: if ye can certainly declare it me within the
seven days of the feast, and find it out, then I will give you thirty
sheets and thirty change of garments:

<span id="an_14:13">14:13</span> But if ye cannot declare it to me, then
shall ye give me thirty sheets and thirty change of garments. And they
said to him, propose thy riddle, that we may hear it.

<span id="an_14:14">14:14</span> And he said to them, Out of the eater
came forth food, and out of the strong came forth sweetness. And they
could not in three days expound the riddle.

<span id="an_14:15">14:15</span> And it came to pass on the seventh day,
that they said to Samson's wife, Entice thy husband, that he may declare
to us the riddle, lest we burn thee and thy father's house with fire:
have ye called us to take what we possess? is it not so?

<span id="an_14:16">14:16</span> And Samson's wife wept before him, and
said, Thou dost but hate me, and lovest me not: thou hast proposed a
riddle to the children of my people, and hast not told it to me. And he
said to her, Behold, I have not told it to my father nor to my mother,
and shall I tell it to thee?

<span id="an_14:17">14:17</span> And she wept before him the seven days,
while their feast lasted: and it came to pass on the seventh day, that
he told her, because she urged him: and she told the riddle to the
children of her people.

<span id="an_14:18">14:18</span> And the men of the city said to him on
the seventh day before the sun went down, What is sweeter than honey?
and what is stronger than a lion? And he said to them, If ye had not
plowed with my heifer, ye had not found out my riddle.

<span id="an_14:19">14:19</span> And the Spirit of the LORD came upon
him, and he went down to Ashkelon, and slew thirty men of them, and took
their spoil, and gave change of garments to them who expounded the
riddle. And his anger was kindled, and he went up to his father's house.

<span id="an_14:20">14:20</span> But Samson's wife was given to his
companion, whom he had used as his friend.

<span id="an_15:1">15:1</span> But it came to pass after a while, in the
time of wheat-harvest, that Samson visited his wife with a kid; and he
said, I will go in to my wife into the chamber. But her father would not
suffer him to go in.

<span id="an_15:2">15:2</span> And her father said, I verily thought
that thou hadst utterly hated her; therefore I gave her to thy
companion: is not her younger sister fairer than she? take her, I pray
thee, instead of her.

<span id="an_15:3">15:3</span> And Samson said concerning them, Now
shall I be more blameless than the Philistines, though I do them a
displeasure.

<span id="an_15:4">15:4</span> And Samson went and caught three hundred
foxes, and took fire-brands, and turned tail to tail, and put a
fire-brand in the midst between two tails.

<span id="an_15:5">15:5</span> And when he had set the brands on fire,
he let them go into the standing corn of the Philistines, and burnt up
both the shocks and also the standing corn, with the vineyards and
olives.

<span id="an_15:6">15:6</span> Then the Philistines said, Who hath done
this? And they answered, Samson, the son-in-law of the Timnite, because
he had taken his wife, and given her to his companion. And the
Philistines came up, and burnt her and her father with fire.

<span id="an_15:7">15:7</span> And Samson said to them, Though ye have
done this, yet will I be avenged of you, and after that I will cease.

<span id="an_15:8">15:8</span> And he smote them hip and thigh with a
great slaughter. And he went down and dwelt in the top of the rock Etam.

<span id="an_15:9">15:9</span> Then the Philistines went up, and
encamped in Judah, and spread themselves in Lehi.

<span id="an_15:10">15:10</span> And the men of Judah said, Why have ye
come up against us? And they answered, We have come to bind Samson, to
do to him as he hath done to us.

<span id="an_15:11">15:11</span> Then three thousand men of Judah went
to the top of the rock Etam, and said to Samson, Knowest thou not that
the Philistines are rulers over us? what is this that thou hast done to
us? And he said to them, As they did to me, so have I done to them.

<span id="an_15:12">15:12</span> And they said to him, We have come down
to bind thee, that we may deliver thee into the hand of the Philistines.
And Samson said to them, Swear to me, that ye will not fall upon me
yourselves.

<span id="an_15:13">15:13</span> And they spoke to him, saying, No; but
we will bind thee fast, and deliver thee into their hand: but surely we
will not kill thee. And they bound him with two new cords, and brought
him up from the rock.

<span id="an_15:14">15:14</span> And when he came to Lehi, the
Philistines shouted against him: and the Spirit of the LORD came
mightily upon him, and the cords that were upon his arms became as flax
that was burnt with fire, and his bands loosed from off his the hands.

<span id="an_15:15">15:15</span> And he found a fresh jaw-bone of an
ass, and put forth his hand, and took it, and slew a thousand men with
it.

<span id="an_15:16">15:16</span> And Samson said, With the jaw-bone of
an ass, heaps upon heaps, with the jaw of an ass have I slain a thousand
men.

<span id="an_15:17">15:17</span> And it came to pass when he had made an
end of speaking, that he cast away the jaw-bone out of his hand, and
called that place Ramath-lehi.

<span id="an_15:18">15:18</span> And he was very thirsty, and called on
the LORD, and said, Thou hast given this great deliverance into the hand
of thy servant: and now shall I die by thirst, and fall into the hand of
the uncircumcised?

<span id="an_15:19">15:19</span> But God cleaved a hollow place that was
in the jaw, and there came water out of it; and when he had drank, his
spirit came again, and he revived. Wherefore he called the name of it
En-hakkore, which is in Lehi to this day.

<span id="an_15:20">15:20</span> And he judged Israel, in the days of
the Philistines, twenty years.

<span id="an_16:1">16:1</span> Then went Samson to Gaza, and saw there a
harlot, and went in to her.

<span id="an_16:2">16:2</span> And it was told the Gazites, saying,
Samson is come hither. And they encompassed him, and laid wait for him
all night in the gate of the city, and were quiet all the night, saying,
In the morning when it is day we shall kill him.

<span id="an_16:3">16:3</span> And Samson lay till midnight, and arose
at midnight, and took the doors of the gate of the city, and the two
posts, and went away with them, bar and all, and put them upon his
shoulders, and carried them up to the top of a hill that is before
Hebron.

<span id="an_16:4">16:4</span> And it came to pass afterward, that he
loved a woman in the valley of Sorek, whose name was Delilah.

<span id="an_16:5">16:5</span> And the lords of the Philistines came to
her, and said to her, Entice him, and see in what his great strength
lieth, and by what means we may prevail against him, that we may bind
him to afflict him: and we will give thee every one of us eleven hundred
pieces of silver.

<span id="an_16:6">16:6</span> And Delilah said to Samson, Tell me, I
pray thee, in what thy great strength lieth, and with what thou mayest
be bound to afflict thee.

<span id="an_16:7">16:7</span> And Samson said to her, If they bind me
with seven green withs, that were never dried, then shall I be weak, and
be as another man.

<span id="an_16:8">16:8</span> Then the lords of the Philistines brought
to her seven green withs, which had not been dried, and she bound him
with them.

<span id="an_16:9">16:9</span> (Now there were men lying in wait,
abiding with her in the chamber.) And she said to him, The Philistines
are upon thee, Samson. And he broke the withs as a thread of tow is
broken when it toucheth the fire. So his strength was not known.

<span id="an_16:10">16:10</span> And Delilah said to Samson, Behold,
thou hast mocked me, and told me lies: now tell me, I pray thee, with
what thou mayest be bound.

<span id="an_16:11">16:11</span> And he said to her, If they bind me
fast with new ropes that never were used, then shall I be weak, and be
as another man.

<span id="an_16:12">16:12</span> Delilah therefore took new ropes, and
bound him with them, and said to him, The Philistines are upon thee,
Samson. (And there were liers in wait abiding in the chamber.) And he
broke them from off his arms like a thread.

<span id="an_16:13">16:13</span> And Delilah said to Samson, hitherto
thou hast mocked me, and told me lies: tell me with what thou mayest be
bound. And he said to her, If thou weavest the seven locks of my head
with the web.

<span id="an_16:14">16:14</span> And she fastened it with the pin, and
said to him, The Philistines are upon thee, Samson. And he awaked out of
his sleep, and went away with the pin of the beam, and with the web.

<span id="an_16:15">16:15</span> And she said to him, How canst thou
say, I love thee, when thy heart is not with me? Thou hast mocked me
these three times, and hast not told me in what thy great strength
lieth.

<span id="an_16:16">16:16</span> And it came to pass when she pressed
him daily with her words, and urged him, so that his soul was vexed to
death;

<span id="an_16:17">16:17</span> That he told her all his heart, and
said to her, There hath not come a razor upon my head; for I have been a
Nazarite to God from my birth: if I be shaved, then my strength will go
from me, and I shall become weak, and be like any other man.

<span id="an_16:18">16:18</span> And when Delilah saw that he had told
her all his heart, she sent and called for the lords of the Philistines,
saying, Come up this once, for he hath disclosed to me all his heart.
Then the lords of the Philistines came up to her and brought money in
their hand.

<span id="an_16:19">16:19</span> And she made him sleep upon her knees;
and she called for a man, and she caused him to shave off the seven
locks of his head; and she began to afflict him, and his strength went
from him.

<span id="an_16:20">16:20</span> And she said, the Philistines are upon
thee, Samson. And he awoke out of his sleep, and said, I will go out as
at other times before, and shake myself. And he knew not that the LORD
had departed from him.

<span id="an_16:21">16:21</span> But the Philistines took him and put
out his eyes, and brought him down to Gaza, and bound him with fetters
of brass; and he did grind in the prison-house.

<span id="an_16:22">16:22</span> However the hair of his head began to
grow again after he was shaved.

<span id="an_16:23">16:23</span> Then the lords of the Philistines
assembled to offer a great sacrifice to Dagon their god, and to rejoice:
for they said, Our god hath delivered Samson our enemy into our hand.

<span id="an_16:24">16:24</span> And when the people saw him, they
praised their god: for they said, Our god hath delivered into our hands
our enemy, and the destroyer of our country; who slew many of us.

<span id="an_16:25">16:25</span> And it came to pass, when their hearts
were merry, that they said, Call for Samson that he may make us sport.
And they called for Samson out of the prison-house; and he made them
sport: and they set him between the pillars.

<span id="an_16:26">16:26</span> And Samson said to the lad that held
him by the hand, Suffer me that I may feel the pillars upon which the
house standeth, that I may lean upon them.

<span id="an_16:27">16:27</span> Now the house was full of men and
women: and all the lords of the Philistines were there: and there were
upon the roof about three thousand men and women, that beheld while
Samson made sport.

<span id="an_16:28">16:28</span> And Samson called to the LORD, and
said, O Lord GOD, remember me, I pray thee, and strengthen me, I pray
thee, only this once, O God, that I may be at once avenged of the
Philistines for my two eyes.

<span id="an_16:29">16:29</span> And Samson took hold of the two middle
pillars upon which the house stood, and on which it was supported, of
the one with his right hand, and of the other with his left.

<span id="an_16:30">16:30</span> And Samson said, Let me die with the
Philistines. And he bowed himself with all his might; and the house fell
upon the lords, and upon all the people that were in it. So the dead
which he slew at his death were more than they which he slew in his
life.

<span id="an_16:31">16:31</span> Then his brethren and all the house of
his father came down, and took him, and brought him up, and buried him
between Zorah and Eshtaol in the burying-place of Manoah his father. And
he judged Israel twenty years.

<span id="an_17:1">17:1</span> And there was a man of mount Ephraim,
whose name was Micah.

<span id="an_17:2">17:2</span> And he said to his mother, The eleven
hundred shekels of silver that were taken from thee, about which thou
didst curse, and speak of also in my ears, behold, the silver is with
me; I took it. And his mother said, Blessed be thou of the LORD, my son.

<span id="an_17:3">17:3</span> And when he had restored the eleven
hundred shekels of silver to his mother, his mother said, I had wholly
dedicated the silver to the LORD from my hand for my son, to make a
graven image and a molten image: now therefore I will restore it to
thee.

<span id="an_17:4">17:4</span> Yet he restored the money to his mother;
and his mother took two hundred shekels of silver, and gave them to the
founder, who made of it a graven image and a molten image: and they were
in the house of Micah.

<span id="an_17:5">17:5</span> And the man Micah had a house of gods,
and made an ephod, and teraphim, and consecrated one of his sons, who
became his priest.

<span id="an_17:6">17:6</span> In those days there was no king in
Israel, but every man did that which was right in his own eyes.

<span id="an_17:7">17:7</span> And there was a young man out of
Beth-lehem-judah of the family of Judah, who was a Levite, and he
sojourned there.

<span id="an_17:8">17:8</span> And the man departed out of the city from
Beth-lehem-judah, to sojourn where he could find a place: and he came to
mount Ephraim to the house of Micah, as he journeyed.

<span id="an_17:9">17:9</span> And Micah said to him, Whence comest
thou? And he said to him, I am a Levite of Beth-lehem-judah, and I go to
sojourn where I may find a place.

<span id="an_17:10">17:10</span> And Micah said to him, Dwell with me,
and be to me a father and a priest, and I will give thee ten shekels of
silver by the year, and a suit of apparel, and thy victuals. So the
Levite went in.

<span id="an_17:11">17:11</span> And the Levite was content to dwell
with the man; and the young man was to him as one of his sons.

<span id="an_17:12">17:12</span> And Micah consecrated the Levite; and
the young man became his priest, and was in the house of Micah.

<span id="an_17:13">17:13</span> Then said Micah, Now I know that the
LORD will do me good, seeing I have a Levite for my priest.

<span id="an_18:1">18:1</span> In those days there was no king in
Israel: and in those days the tribe of the Danites sought for themselves
an inheritance to dwell in; for to that day all their inheritance had
not fallen to them among the tribes of Israel.

<span id="an_18:2">18:2</span> And the children of Dan sent of their
family five men from their borders, men of valor, from Zorah, and from
Eshtaol, to explore the land, and to search it; and they said to them,
Go, search the land: who when they came to mount Ephraim, to the house
of Micah, they lodged there.

<span id="an_18:3">18:3</span> When they were by the house of Micah,
they knew the voice of the young man the Levite: and they turned in
thither, and said to him, Who brought thee hither? and what makest thou
in this place? and what hast thou here?

<span id="an_18:4">18:4</span> And he said to them, Thus and thus
dealeth Micah with me, and hath hired me, and I am his priest.

<span id="an_18:5">18:5</span> And they said to him, Ask counsel, we
pray thee, of God, that we may know whether our way which we go shall be
prosperous.

<span id="an_18:6">18:6</span> And the priest said to them, Go in peace:
before the LORD is your way in which ye go.

<span id="an_18:7">18:7</span> Then the five men departed, and came to
Laish, and saw the people that were in it, how they dwelt careless,
after the manner of the Zidonians, quiet and secure; and there was no
magistrate in the land, that might put them to shame in any thing; and
they were far from the Zidonians, and had no business with any man.

<span id="an_18:8">18:8</span> And they came to their brethren to Zorah
and Eshtaol: and their brethren said to them, What say ye?

<span id="an_18:9">18:9</span> And they said, Arise, that we may go up
against them: for we have seen the land, and behold, it is very good:
and are ye still? be not slothful to go, and to enter to possess the
land.

<span id="an_18:10">18:10</span> When ye go, ye shall come to a people
secure, and to a large land: for God hath given it into your hands; a
place where there is no want of any thing that is on the earth.

<span id="an_18:11">18:11</span> And there went from thence of the
family of the Danites, out of Zorah and out of Eshtaol, six hundred men
appointed with weapons of war.

<span id="an_18:12">18:12</span> And they went up, and encamped in
Kirjath-jearim, in Judah: wherefore they called that place Mahaneh-dan
to this day: behold, it is behind Kirjath-jearim.

<span id="an_18:13">18:13</span> And they passed thence to mount
Ephraim, and came to the house of Micah.

<span id="an_18:14">18:14</span> Then answered the five men that went to
explore the country of Laish, and said to their brethren, Do ye know
that there is in these houses an ephod, and teraphim, and a graven
image, and a molten image? now therefore consider what ye have to do.

<span id="an_18:15">18:15</span> And they turned thitherward, and came
to the house of the young man the Levite, even to the house of Micah,
and saluted him.

<span id="an_18:16">18:16</span> And the six hundred men appointed with
their weapons of war, who were of the children of Dan, stood by the
entrance of the gate.

<span id="an_18:17">18:17</span> And the five men that went to explore
the land went up, and came in thither, and took the graven image, and
the ephod, and the teraphim, and the molten image: and the priest stood
in the entrance of the gate with the six hundred men that were appointed
with weapons of war.

<span id="an_18:18">18:18</span> And these went into Micah's house, and
brought the carved image, the ephod, and the teraphim, and the molten
image. Then said the priest to them, What do ye?

<span id="an_18:19">18:19</span> And they said to him, Hold thy peace,
lay thy hand upon thy mouth, and go with us, and be to us a father and a
priest: Is it better for thee to be a priest to the house of one man, or
that thou shouldst be a priest to a tribe and a family in Israel?

<span id="an_18:20">18:20</span> And the priest's heart was glad, and he
took the ephod, and the teraphim, and the graven image, and went in the
midst of the people.

<span id="an_18:21">18:21</span> So they turned and departed, and put
the little ones, and the cattle, and the furniture before them.

<span id="an_18:22">18:22</span> And when they were a good way from the
house of Micah, the men that were in the houses near to Micah's house
were collected, and overtook the children of Dan.

<span id="an_18:23">18:23</span> And they cried to the children of Dan.
And they turned their faces, and said to Micah, What aileth thee, that
thou comest with such a company?

<span id="an_18:24">18:24</span> And he said, Ye have taken away my gods
which I made, and the priest, and ye have gone away: and what have I
more? and what is this that ye say to me, What aileth thee?

<span id="an_18:25">18:25</span> And the children of Dan said to him,
Let not thy voice be heard among us, lest angry fellows rush upon thee,
and thou lose thy life, with the lives of thy household.

<span id="an_18:26">18:26</span> And the children of Dan departed: and
when Micah saw that they were too strong for him, he turned and went
back to his house.

<span id="an_18:27">18:27</span> And they took the things which Micah
had made, and the priest which he had, and came to Laish, to a people
that were at quiet and secure: and they smote them with the edge of the
sword, and burnt the city with fire.

<span id="an_18:28">18:28</span> And there was no deliverer, because it
was far from Zidon, and they had no business with any man; and it was in
the valley that lieth by Beth-rehob. And they built a city and dwelt in
it.

<span id="an_18:29">18:29</span> And they called the name of the city
Dan, after the name of Dan their father, who was born to Israel: but the
name of the city was Laish at the first.

<span id="an_18:30">18:30</span> And the children of Dan set up the
graven image: and Jonathan, the son of Gershom, the son of Manasseh, he
and his sons were priests to the tribe of Dan until the day of the
captivity of the land.

<span id="an_18:31">18:31</span> And they set up for themselves Micah's
graven image which he made, all the time that the house of God was in
Shiloh.

<span id="an_19:1">19:1</span> And it came to pass in those days, when
there was no king in Israel, that there was a certain Levite dwelling on
the side of mount Ephraim, who took to him a concubine out of
Beth-lehem-judah.

<span id="an_19:2">19:2</span> And his concubine played the harlot
against him, and went away from him to her father's house to
Beth-lehem-judah, and was there four whole months.

<span id="an_19:3">19:3</span> And her husband arose, and went after
her, to speak kindly to her, and to bring her again, having his servant
with him, and a couple of asses: and she brought him into her father's
house: and when the father of the damsel saw him, he rejoiced to meet
him.

<span id="an_19:4">19:4</span> And his father-in-law, the damsel's
father, retained him; and he abode with him three days: so they ate and
drank, and lodged there.

<span id="an_19:5">19:5</span> And it came to pass on the fourth day,
when they arose early in the morning, that he arose to depart: and the
damsel's father said to his son-in-law, Comfort thy heart with a morsel
of bread, and afterward depart.

<span id="an_19:6">19:6</span> And they sat down, and ate and drank both
of them together: for the damsel's father had said to the man, Be
content, I pray thee, and tarry all night, and let thy heart be merry.

<span id="an_19:7">19:7</span> And when the man rose to depart, his
father-in-law urged him: therefore he lodged there again.

<span id="an_19:8">19:8</span> And he arose early in the morning on the
fifth day to depart: and the damsel's father said, Comfort thy heart, I
pray thee. And they tarried until afternoon, and they ate both of them.

<span id="an_19:9">19:9</span> And when the man arose to depart, he, and
his concubine, and his servant, his father-in-law, the damsel's father,
said to him, Behold now the day draweth towards evening, I pray you
tarry all night: behold, the day is coming to an end, lodge here, that
thy heart may be merry; and to-morrow get you early on your way, that
thou mayest go home.

<span id="an_19:10">19:10</span> But the man would not tarry that night,
but he arose and departed, and came over against Jebus, which is
Jerusalem; and there were with him two asses saddled, his concubine also
was with him.

<span id="an_19:11">19:11</span> And when they were by Jebus, the day
was far spent; and the servant said to his master, Come, I pray thee,
and let us turn in to this city of the Jebusites, and lodge in it.

<span id="an_19:12">19:12</span> And his master said to him, We will not
turn aside hither into the city of a stranger, that is not of the
children of Israel; we will pass over to Gibeah.

<span id="an_19:13">19:13</span> And he said to his servant, Come, and
let us draw near to one of these places to lodge all night, in Gibeah,
or in Ramah.

<span id="an_19:14">19:14</span> And they passed on and went their way;
and the sun went down upon them when they were by Gibeah, which
belongeth to Benjamin.

<span id="an_19:15">19:15</span> And they turned aside thither, to go in
and to lodge in Gibeah: and when he went in, he sat down in a street of
the city: for there was no man that took them into his house to lodge.

<span id="an_19:16">19:16</span> And, behold, there came an old man from
his work out of the field at evening, who was also of mount Ephraim; and
he dwelt in Gibeah: but the men of the place were Benjaminites.

<span id="an_19:17">19:17</span> And when he had lifted up his eyes, he
saw a way-faring man in the street of the city: and the old man said,
Whither goest thou? and whence comest thou?

<span id="an_19:18">19:18</span> And he said to him, We are passing from
Beth-lehem-Judah towards the side of mount Ephraim; from thence am I:
and I went to Beth-lehem-judah, but I am now going to the house of the
LORD; and there is no man that receiveth me into his house.

<span id="an_19:19">19:19</span> Yet there is both straw and provender
for our asses; and there is bread and wine also for me, and for thy
handmaid, and for the young man which is with thy servants: there is no
want of any thing:

<span id="an_19:20">19:20</span> And the old man said, Peace be with
thee; however, let all thy wants lie upon me; only lodge not in the
street.

<span id="an_19:21">19:21</span> So he brought him into his house, and
gave provender to the asses: and they washed their feet and ate and
drank.

<span id="an_19:22">19:22</span> Now as they were making their hearts
merry, behold, the men of the city, certain sons of Belial, beset the
house on all sides, and beat at the door, and spoke to the master of the
house, the old man, saying, Bring forth the man that came into thy
house, that we may know him.

<span id="an_19:23">19:23</span> And the man, the master of the house,
went out to them, and said to them, Nay, my brethren, nay, I pray you,
do not so wickedly; seeing that this man is come into my house, do not
this folly.

<span id="an_19:24">19:24</span> Behold, here is my daughter, a maiden,
and his concubine; them I will bring out now, and humble ye them, and do
with them what seemeth good to you: but to this man do not so vile a
thing.

<span id="an_19:25">19:25</span> But the men would not hearken to him:
so the man took his concubine, and brought her forth to them; and they
knew her, and abused her all the night until the morning: and when the
day began to spring, they let her go.

<span id="an_19:26">19:26</span> Then came the woman in the dawning of
the day, and fell down at the door of the man's house where her lord
was, till it was light.

<span id="an_19:27">19:27</span> And her lord rose in the morning, and
opened the doors of the house, and went out to go his way: and behold,
the woman his concubine had fallen down at the door of the house, and
her hands were upon the threshhold.

<span id="an_19:28">19:28</span> And he said to her, Rise, and let us be
going. But none answered. Then the man took her upon an ass, and the man
rose, and went to his place.

<span id="an_19:29">19:29</span> And when he was come into his house, he
took a knife, and laid hold on his concubine, and divided her, with her
bones, into twelve pieces, and sent her into all the borders of Israel.

<span id="an_19:30">19:30</span> And it was so, that all that saw it,
said, There hath been no such deed done nor seen from the day that the
children of Israel came from the land of Egypt to this day: consider of
it, take advice, and speak your minds.

<span id="an_20:1">20:1</span> Then all the children of Israel went out,
and the congregation was assembled as one man, from Dan even to
Beer-sheba, with the land of Gilead, to the LORD in Mizpeh.

<span id="an_20:2">20:2</span> And the chief of all the people, even of
all the tribes of Israel, presented themselves in the assembly of the
people of God, four hundred thousand footmen that drew sword.

<span id="an_20:3">20:3</span> (Now the children of Benjamin heard that
the children of Israel were gone up to Mizpeh.) Then said the children
of Israel, Tell us, how was this wickedness?

<span id="an_20:4">20:4</span> And the Levite, the husband of the woman
that was slain, answered and said, I came into Gibeah that belongeth to
Benjamin, I and my concubine, to lodge.

<span id="an_20:5">20:5</span> And the men of Gibeah rose against me,
and surrounded the house upon me by night, and thought to have slain me:
and my concubine have they forced, that she is dead.

<span id="an_20:6">20:6</span> And I took my concubine, and cut her in
pieces, and sent her throughout all the country of the inheritance of
Israel: for they have committed lewdness and folly in Israel.

<span id="an_20:7">20:7</span> Behold, ye are all children of Israel;
give here your advice and counsel.

<span id="an_20:8">20:8</span> And all the people arose as one man,
saying, We will not any of us go to his tent, neither will we any of us
turn into his house:

<span id="an_20:9">20:9</span> But now this shall be the thing which we
will do to Gibeah: we will go up by lot against it;

<span id="an_20:10">20:10</span> And we will take ten men of a hundred
throughout all the tribes of Israel, and a hundred of a thousand, and a
thousand out of ten thousand, to fetch provisions for the people, that
they may do, when they come to Gibeah of Benjamin, according to all the
folly that they have wrought in Israel.

<span id="an_20:11">20:11</span> So all the men of Israel were gathered
against the city, knit together as one man.

<span id="an_20:12">20:12</span> And the tribes of Israel sent men
through all the tribe of Benjamin, saying, What wickedness is this that
is done among you?

<span id="an_20:13">20:13</span> Now therefore deliver us the men, the
children of Belial, who are in Gibeah, that we may put them to death,
and banish evil from Israel. But the children of Benjamin would not
hearken to the voice of their brethren, the children of Israel:

<span id="an_20:14">20:14</span> But the children of Benjamin assembled
out of the cities to Gibeah, to go out to battle against the children of
Israel.

<span id="an_20:15">20:15</span> And the children of Benjamin were
numbered at that time out of the cities twenty and six thousand men that
drew sword, besides the inhabitants of Gibeah, who were numbered seven
hundred chosen men.

<span id="an_20:16">20:16</span> Among all this people there were seven
hundred chosen men left-handed; every one could sling stones to a
hair-breadth, and not miss.

<span id="an_20:17">20:17</span> And the men of Israel, besides
Benjamin, were numbered four hundred thousand men that drew sword: all
these were men of war.

<span id="an_20:18">20:18</span> And the children of Israel arose, and
went up to the house of God, and asked counsel of God, and said, Which
of us shall go up first to the battle against the children of Benjamin?
And the LORD said, Judah shall go up first.

<span id="an_20:19">20:19</span> And the children of Israel rose in the
morning, and encamped against Gibeah.

<span id="an_20:20">20:20</span> And the men of Israel went out to
battle against Benjamin; and the men of Israel put themselves in array
to fight against them at Gibeah.

<span id="an_20:21">20:21</span> And the children of Benjamin came forth
from Gibeah, and destroyed down to the ground of the Israelites that day
twenty and two thousand men.

<span id="an_20:22">20:22</span> And the people the men of Israel
encouraged themselves, and set their battle again in array in the place
where they put themselves in array the first day.

<span id="an_20:23">20:23</span> (And the children of Israel went up and
wept before the LORD until evening, and asked counsel of the LORD,
saying, Shall I go up again to battle against the children of Benjamin
my brother? And the LORD said, Go up against him.)

<span id="an_20:24">20:24</span> And the children of Israel came near
against the children of Benjamin the second day.

<span id="an_20:25">20:25</span> And Benjamin went forth against them
out of Gibeah the second day, and destroyed down to the ground of the
children of Israel again eighteen thousand men; all these drew the
sword.

<span id="an_20:26">20:26</span> Then all the children of Israel, and
all the people, went up, and came to the house of God, and wept, and sat
there before the LORD, and fasted that day until evening, and offered
burnt-offerings and peace-offerings before the LORD.

<span id="an_20:27">20:27</span> And the children of Israel inquired of
the LORD, (for the ark of the covenant of God was there in those days,

<span id="an_20:28">20:28</span> And Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the
son of Aaron, stood before it in those days,) saying, Shall I yet again
go out to battle against the children of Benjamin my brother, or shall I
cease? And the LORD said, Go up; for to-morrow I will deliver them into
thy hand.

<span id="an_20:29">20:29</span> And Israel set liers in wait around
Gibeah.

<span id="an_20:30">20:30</span> And the children of Israel went up
against the children of Benjamin on the third day, and put themselves in
array against Gibeah, as at other times.

<span id="an_20:31">20:31</span> And the children of Benjamin went out
against the people, and were drawn away from the city; and they began to
smite of the people, and kill, as at other times, in the highways, of
which one goeth up to the house of God, and the other to Gibeah in the
field, about thirty men of Israel.

<span id="an_20:32">20:32</span> And the children of Benjamin said, They
are smitten down before us, as at the first. But the children of Israel
said, Let us flee, and draw them from the city to the highways.

<span id="an_20:33">20:33</span> And all the men of Israel rose out of
their place, and put themselves in array at Baal-tamar: and the liers in
wait of Israel came forth out of their places, even out of the meadows
of Gibeah.

<span id="an_20:34">20:34</span> And there came against Gibeah ten
thousand chosen men out of all Israel, and the battle was severe: but
they knew not that evil was near them.

<span id="an_20:35">20:35</span> And the LORD smote Benjamin before
Israel: and the children of Israel destroyed of the Benjaminites that
day twenty and five thousand and a hundred men: all these drew the
sword.

<span id="an_20:36">20:36</span> So the children of Benjamin saw that
they were smitten: for the men of Israel gave place to the Benjaminites,
because they trusted to the liers in wait which they had set beside
Gibeah.

<span id="an_20:37">20:37</span> And the liers in wait hasted, and
rushed upon Gibeah; and the liers in wait drew themselves along, and
smote all the city with the edge of the sword.

<span id="an_20:38">20:38</span> Now there was an appointed sign between
the men of Israel and the liers in wait, that they should make a great
flame with smoke to rise from the city.

<span id="an_20:39">20:39</span> And when the men of Israel retired in
the battle, Benjamin began to smite and kill of the men of Israel about
thirty persons: for they said, Surely they are smitten down before us,
as in the first battle.

<span id="an_20:40">20:40</span> But when the flame began to rise from
the city with a pillar of smoke, the Benjaminites looked behind them,
and behold, the flame of the city ascended to heaven.

<span id="an_20:41">20:41</span> And when the men of Israel turned
again, the men of Benjamin were amazed: for they saw that evil had come
upon them.

<span id="an_20:42">20:42</span> Therefore they turned their backs
before the men of Israel to the way of the wilderness; but the battle
overtook them; and them who came out of the cities they destroyed in the
midst of them.

<span id="an_20:43">20:43</span> Thus they inclosed the Benjaminites on
all sides, and chased them, and trod them down with ease over against
Gibeah towards the sun-rising.

<span id="an_20:44">20:44</span> And there fell of Benjamin eighteen
thousand men; all these were men of valor.

<span id="an_20:45">20:45</span> And they turned and fled towards the
wilderness to the rock of Rimmon: and they gleaned of them in the
highways five thousand men; and pursued hard after them to Gidom, and
slew two thousand men of them.

<span id="an_20:46">20:46</span> So that all who fell that day of
Benjamin were twenty and five thousand men that drew the sword; all
these were men of valor.

<span id="an_20:47">20:47</span> But six hundred men turned and fled to
the wilderness to the rock Rimmon, and abode in the rock Rimmon four
months.

<span id="an_20:48">20:48</span> And the men of Israel turned again upon
the children of Benjamin, and smote them with the edge of the sword, as
well the men of every city, as the beast, and all that came to hand:
also they set on fire all the cities that they came to.

<span id="an_21:1">21:1</span> Now the men of Israel had sworn in
Mizpeh, saying, There shall not any of us give his daughter to Benjamin
for a wife.

<span id="an_21:2">21:2</span> And the people came to the house of God,
and abode there till evening before God, and lifted up their voices, and
wept bitterly;

<span id="an_21:3">21:3</span> And said, O LORD God of Israel, why is
this come to pass in Israel, that there should be to-day one tribe
lacking in Israel?

<span id="an_21:4">21:4</span> And it came to pass on the morrow, that
the people rose early, and built there an altar, and offered
burnt-offerings, and peace-offerings.

<span id="an_21:5">21:5</span> And the children of Israel said, Who is
there among all the tribes of Israel that came not up with the
congregation to the LORD? For they had made a great oath concerning him
that came not up to the LORD to Mizpeh, saying, He shall surely be put
to death.

<span id="an_21:6">21:6</span> And the children of Israel repented for
Benjamin their brother, and said, There is one tribe cut off from Israel
this day.

<span id="an_21:7">21:7</span> How shall we do for wives for them that
remain, seeing we have sworn by the LORD, that we will not give them of
our daughters for wives?

<span id="an_21:8">21:8</span> And they said, What one is there of the
tribes of Israel that came not up to Mizpeh to the LORD? and behold,
there came none to the camp from Jabesh-gilead to the assembly.

<span id="an_21:9">21:9</span> For the people were numbered, and behold,
there were none of the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead there.

<span id="an_21:10">21:10</span> And the congregation sent thither
twelve thousand men of the most valiant, and commanded them, saying, Go
and smite the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead with the edge of the sword,
with the women and the children.

<span id="an_21:11">21:11</span> And this is the thing that ye shall do,
Ye shall utterly destroy every male, and every woman that hath lain by
man.

<span id="an_21:12">21:12</span> And they found among the inhabitants of
Jabesh-gilead four hundred young virgins that had known no man by lying
with any male: and they brought them to the camp to Shiloh, which is in
the land of Canaan.

<span id="an_21:13">21:13</span> And the whole congregation sent some to
speak to the children of Benjamin that were in the rock Rimmon, and to
call peaceably to them.

<span id="an_21:14">21:14</span> And Benjamin came again at that time;
and they gave them wives which they had saved alive of the women of
Jabesh-gilead: and yet so they sufficed them not.

<span id="an_21:15">21:15</span> And the people repented for Benjamin,
because the LORD had made a breach in the tribes of Israel.

<span id="an_21:16">21:16</span> Then the elders of the congregation
said, How shall we do for wives for them that remain, seeing the women
are destroyed out of Benjamin?

<span id="an_21:17">21:17</span> And they said, There must be an
inheritance for them that have escaped of Benjamin, that a tribe be not
destroyed out of Israel.

<span id="an_21:18">21:18</span> But, we may not give them wives of our
daughters: for the children of Israel have sworn, saying, Cursed be he
that giveth a wife to Benjamin.

<span id="an_21:19">21:19</span> Then they said, Behold, there is a
feast of the LORD in Shiloh yearly in a place which is on the north side
of Beth-el, on the east side of the highway that goeth up from Beth-el
to Shechem, and on the south of Lebonah.

<span id="an_21:20">21:20</span> Therefore they commanded the children
of Benjamin, saying, Go, and lie in wait in the vineyards;

<span id="an_21:21">21:21</span> And see, and behold, if the daughters
of Shiloh come out to dance in dances, then come ye out of the
vineyards, and catch you every man his wife of the daughters of Shiloh,
and go to the land of Benjamin.

<span id="an_21:22">21:22</span> And it shall be, when their fathers or
their brethren come to us to complain, that we will say to them, Be
favorable to them for our sakes: because we reserved not to each man his
wife in the war: for ye did not give to them at this time, that ye
should be guilty.

<span id="an_21:23">21:23</span> And the children of Benjamin did so,
and took them wives, according to their number, of them that danced,
whom they caught: and they went and returned to their inheritance, and
repaired the cities and dwelt in them.

<span id="an_21:24">21:24</span> And the children of Israel departed
thence at that time, every man to his tribe and to his family, and they
went from thence every man to his inheritance.

<span id="an_21:25">21:25</span> In those days there was no king in
Israel: every man did that which was right in his own eyes.
