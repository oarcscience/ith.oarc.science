### Webster's Bible: James

<span id="an_1:1">1:1</span> James, a servant of God and of the Lord
Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad, greeting.

<span id="an_1:2">1:2</span> My brethren, count it all joy when ye fall
into divers temptations.

<span id="an_1:3">1:3</span> Knowing this, that the trying of your faith
worketh patience.

<span id="an_1:4">1:4</span> But let patience have her perfect work,
that ye may be perfect and entire, wanting nothing.

<span id="an_1:5">1:5</span> If any of you lacketh wisdom, let him ask
of God, who giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it
shall be given to him.

<span id="an_1:6">1:6</span> But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering.
For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and
tossed.

<span id="an_1:7">1:7</span> For let not that man think that he shall
receive any thing from the Lord.

<span id="an_1:8">1:8</span> A man unsettled in his opinions is unstable
in all his ways.

<span id="an_1:9">1:9</span> Let the brother of low degree rejoice in
that he is exalted:

<span id="an_1:10">1:10</span> But the rich, in that he is made low:
because as the flower of the grass he shall pass away.

<span id="an_1:11">1:11</span> For the sun hath no sooner risen with a
burning heat, but it withereth the grass, and its flower falleth, and
the grace of the fashion of it perisheth: so also shall the rich man
fade away in his ways.

<span id="an_1:12">1:12</span> Blessed is the man that endureth
temptation: for when he is tried, he shall receive the crown of life,
which the Lord hath promised to them that love him.

<span id="an_1:13">1:13</span> Let no man say when he is tempted, I am
tempted by God: for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he
any man:

<span id="an_1:14">1:14</span> But every man is tempted, when he is
drawn away by his own lust, and enticed.

<span id="an_1:15">1:15</span> Then when lust hath conceived, it
bringeth forth sin: and sin, when it is finished, bringeth forth death.

<span id="an_1:16">1:16</span> Do not err, my beloved brethren.

<span id="an_1:17">1:17</span> Every good gift and every perfect gift is
from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom is no
variableness, neither shadow of turning.

<span id="an_1:18">1:18</span> Of his own will he hath begotten us with
the word of truth, that we should be a kind of first-fruits of his
creatures.

<span id="an_1:19">1:19</span> Wherefore, my beloved brethren, let every
man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath:

<span id="an_1:20">1:20</span> For the wrath of man worketh not the
righteousness of God.

<span id="an_1:21">1:21</span> Wherefore lay apart all filthiness and
superfluity of naughtiness, and receive with meekness the ingrafted
word, which is able to save your souls.

<span id="an_1:22">1:22</span> But be ye doers of the word, and not
hearers only, deceiving your own selves.

<span id="an_1:23">1:23</span> For if any is a hearer of the word, and
not a doer, he is like a man beholding his natural face in a glass:

<span id="an_1:24">1:24</span> For he beholdeth himself, and goeth away,
and immediately forgetteth what manner of man he was.

<span id="an_1:25">1:25</span> But he who looketh into the perfect law
of liberty, and continueth in it, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a
doer of the work, this man shall be blessed in his deed.

<span id="an_1:26">1:26</span> If any man among you seemeth to be
religious, and bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart,
this man's religion is vain.

<span id="an_1:27">1:27</span> Pure religion and undefiled before God
and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their
affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world.

<span id="an_2:1">2:1</span> My brethren, have not the faith of our Lord
Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory, with respect of persons.

<span id="an_2:2">2:2</span> For if there come into your assembly a man
with a gold ring, in goodly apparel, and there come in also a poor man
in vile raiment;

<span id="an_2:3">2:3</span> And ye have respect to him that weareth the
gay clothing, and say to him, Sit thou here in a good place; and say to
the poor, Stand thou there, or sit here under my footstool:

<span id="an_2:4">2:4</span> Are ye not then partial in yourselves, and
are become judges of evil thoughts?

<span id="an_2:5">2:5</span> Hearken, my beloved brethren, Hath not God
chosen the poor of this world rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom
which he hath promised to them that love him?

<span id="an_2:6">2:6</span> But ye have despised the poor. Do not rich
men oppress you, and draw you before the judgment-seats?

<span id="an_2:7">2:7</span> Do they not blaspheme that worthy name by
the which ye are called?

<span id="an_2:8">2:8</span> If ye fulfill the royal law according to
the scripture, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself, ye do well:

<span id="an_2:9">2:9</span> But if ye have respect to persons, ye
commit sin, and are convicted by the law as transgressors.

<span id="an_2:10">2:10</span> For whoever shall keep the whole law, and
yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all.

<span id="an_2:11">2:11</span> For he that said, Do not commit adultery;
said also, Do not kill. Now if thou committest no adultery, yet if thou
killest, thou art become a transgressor of the law.

<span id="an_2:12">2:12</span> So speak ye, and so do, as they that
shall be judged by the law of liberty.

<span id="an_2:13">2:13</span> For he shall have judgment without mercy
that hath shown no mercy; and mercy rejoiceth against judgment.

<span id="an_2:14">2:14</span> What doth it profit, my brethren, though
a man sayeth he hath faith, and hath not works? can faith save him?

<span id="an_2:15">2:15</span> If a brother or sister is naked, and
destitute of daily food,

<span id="an_2:16">2:16</span> And one of you sayeth to them, Depart in
peace, be you warmed and filled; notwithstanding ye give them not those
things which are needful to the body; what doth it profit?

<span id="an_2:17">2:17</span> Even so faith, if it hath not works, is
dead, being alone.

<span id="an_2:18">2:18</span> Also a man may say, Thou hast faith, and
I have works: show me thy faith without thy works, and I will show thee
my faith by my works.

<span id="an_2:19">2:19</span> Thou believest that there is one God;
thou doest well: the demons also believe, and tremble.

<span id="an_2:20">2:20</span> But wilt thou know, O vain man, that
faith without works is dead?

<span id="an_2:21">2:21</span> Was not Abraham our father justified by
works, when he had offered Isaac his son upon the altar?

<span id="an_2:22">2:22</span> Seest thou how faith wrought with his
works, and by works was faith made perfect?

<span id="an_2:23">2:23</span> And the scripture was fulfilled, which
saith, Abraham believed God, and it was imputed to him for
righteousness: and he was called the Friend of God.

<span id="an_2:24">2:24</span> Ye see then that by works a man is
justified, and not by faith only.

<span id="an_2:25">2:25</span> Likewise also was not Rahab the harlot
justified by works, when she had received the messengers, and had sent
them out another way?

<span id="an_2:26">2:26</span> For as the body without the spirit is
dead, so faith without works is dead also.

<span id="an_3:1">3:1</span> My brethren, be not many teachers, knowing
that we shall receive the greater condemnation.

<span id="an_3:2">3:2</span> For in many things we all offend. If any
man offendeth not in word, the same is a perfect man, able also to
bridle the whole body.

<span id="an_3:3">3:3</span> Behold, we put bits in the mouths of
horses, that they may obey us; and we turn about their whole body.

<span id="an_3:4">3:4</span> Behold also the ships, which though they
are so great, and are driven by fierce winds, yet they are turned about
with a very small helm, withersoever the governor willeth.

<span id="an_3:5">3:5</span> Even so the tongue is a little member, and
boasteth great things. Behold, how great a matter a little fire
kindleth!

<span id="an_3:6">3:6</span> And the tongue is a fire, a world of
iniquity: so is the tongue among our members, that it defileth the whole
body, and setteth on fire the course of nature; and it is set on fire
from hell.

<span id="an_3:7">3:7</span> For every kind of beasts, and of birds, and
of serpents, and of animals in the sea, is tamed, and hath been tamed by
mankind:

<span id="an_3:8">3:8</span> But the tongue can no man tame; it is an
unruly evil, full of deadly poison.

<span id="an_3:9">3:9</span> With this we bless God, even the Father;
and with this we curse men, who are made after the similitude of God.

<span id="an_3:10">3:10</span> Out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing
and cursing. My brethren, these things ought not so to be.

<span id="an_3:11">3:11</span> Doth a fountain send forth at the same
place sweet water and bitter?

<span id="an_3:12">3:12</span> Can the fig-tree, my brethren, bear
olive-berries? or a vine, figs? so no fountain can yield both salt water
and fresh.

<span id="an_3:13">3:13</span> Who is a wise man and endued with
knowledge among you? let him show by a good deportment his works with
meekness of wisdom.

<span id="an_3:14">3:14</span> But if ye have bitter envying and strife
in your hearts, glory not, and lie not against the truth.

<span id="an_3:15">3:15</span> This wisdom descendeth not from above,
but is earthly, sensual, demoniacal.

<span id="an_3:16">3:16</span> For where envying and strife is, there is
confusion and every evil work.

<span id="an_3:17">3:17</span> But the wisdom that is from above is
first pure, then peaceable, gentle, and easy to be entreated, full of
mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy.

<span id="an_3:18">3:18</span> And the fruit of righteousness is sown in
peace by them that make peace.

<span id="an_4:1">4:1</span> From whence come wars and fightings among
you? come they not hence, even from your lusts that war in your members?

<span id="an_4:2">4:2</span> Ye lust and have not: ye kill, and desire
to have, and cannot obtain: ye fight and war, yet ye have not, because
ye ask not.

<span id="an_4:3">4:3</span> Ye ask, and receive not, because ye ask
amiss, that ye may consume it upon your lusts.

<span id="an_4:4">4:4</span> Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not
that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? whoever therefore
will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God.

<span id="an_4:5">4:5</span> Do ye think that the scripture saith in
vain, The spirit that dwelleth in us lusteth to envy?

<span id="an_4:6">4:6</span> But he giveth more grace. Wherefore he
saith, God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace to the humble.

<span id="an_4:7">4:7</span> Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist
the devil, and he will flee from you.

<span id="an_4:8">4:8</span> Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to
you. Cleanse your hands, ye sinners, and purify your hearts, ye
double-minded.

<span id="an_4:9">4:9</span> Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep: let your
laughter be turned to mourning, and your joy to heaviness.

<span id="an_4:10">4:10</span> Humble yourselves in the sight of the
Lord, and he will lift you up.

<span id="an_4:11">4:11</span> Speak not evil one of another, brethren.
He that speaketh evil of his brother, and judgeth his brother, speaketh
evil of the law, and judgeth the law: but if thou judgest the law, thou
art not a doer of the law, but a judge.

<span id="an_4:12">4:12</span> There is one lawgiver, who is able to
save, and to destroy: who art thou that judgest another?

<span id="an_4:13">4:13</span> Come now, ye that say, To-day or
to-morrow we will go into such a city, and continue there a year, and
buy, and sell, and get gain:

<span id="an_4:14">4:14</span> Whereas ye know not what will be on the
morrow: For what is your life? It is even a vapor, that appeareth for a
little time, and then vanisheth away.

<span id="an_4:15">4:15</span> Instead of that ye ought to say, If the
Lord will, we shall live, and do this, or that.

<span id="an_4:16">4:16</span> But now ye rejoice in your boastings: all
such rejoicing is evil.

<span id="an_4:17">4:17</span> Therefore to him that knoweth to do good,
and doeth it not, to him it is sin.

<span id="an_5:1">5:1</span> Come now, ye rich men, weep and howl for
your miseries that shall come upon you.

<span id="an_5:2">5:2</span> Your riches are corrupted, and your
garments are moth-eaten.

<span id="an_5:3">5:3</span> Your gold and silver is cankered; and the
rust of them shall be a testimony against you, and shall eat your flesh
as it were fire. Ye have amassed treasure for the last days.

<span id="an_5:4">5:4</span> Behold, the hire of the laborers who have
reaped your fields, which is by you kept back by fraud, crieth: and the
cries of them who have reaped have entered into the ears of the Lord of
Sabaoth.

<span id="an_5:5">5:5</span> Ye have lived in pleasure on the earth, and
been wanton; ye have nourished your hearts, as in a day of slaughter.

<span id="an_5:6">5:6</span> Ye have condemned and killed the just; and
he doth not resist you.

<span id="an_5:7">5:7</span> Be patient, therefore, brethren, to the
coming of the Lord. Behold, the husbandman waiteth for the precious
fruit of the earth, and hath long patience for it, until he receiveth
the early and the latter rain.

<span id="an_5:8">5:8</span> Be ye also patient; establish your hearts;
for the coming of the Lord draweth nigh.

<span id="an_5:9">5:9</span> Grudge not one against another, brethren,
lest ye be condemned: behold, the judge standeth before the door.

<span id="an_5:10">5:10</span> Take, my brethren, the prophets, who have
spoken in the name of the Lord, for an example of suffering affliction,
and of patience.

<span id="an_5:11">5:11</span> Behold, we count them happy who endure.
Ye have heard of the patience of Job, and have seen the end of the Lord;
that the Lord is very pitiful, and of tender mercy.

<span id="an_5:12">5:12</span> But above all things, my brethren, swear
not, neither by heaven, neither by the earth, neither by any other oath:
but let your yea, be yea: and your nay, nay; lest ye fall into
condemnation.

<span id="an_5:13">5:13</span> Is any among you afflicted? let him pray.
Is any cheerful? let him sing psalms.

<span id="an_5:14">5:14</span> Is any sick among you? let him call for
the elders of the church; and let them pray over him, anointing him with
oil in the name of the Lord:

<span id="an_5:15">5:15</span> And the prayer of faith will save the
sick, and the Lord will raise him up; and if he hath committed sins,
they will be forgiven him.

<span id="an_5:16">5:16</span> Confess your faults one to another, and
pray one for another, that ye may be healed. The effectual fervent
prayer of the righteous man availeth much.

<span id="an_5:17">5:17</span> Elijah was a man subject to like passions
as we are, and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain: and it rained
not on the earth by the space of three years and six months.

<span id="an_5:18">5:18</span> And he prayed again, and the heaven gave
rain, and the earth brought forth its fruit.

<span id="an_5:19">5:19</span> Brethren, if any one of you should err
from the truth, and one should convert him;

<span id="an_5:20">5:20</span> Let him know, that he who converteth a
sinner from the error of his way will save a soul from death, and will
hide a multitude of sins.
