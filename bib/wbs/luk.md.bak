### Webster's Bible: Luke

<span id="an_1:1">1:1</span> Forasmuch as many have taken in hand to set
forth in order a declaration of those things which are most surely
believed among us,

<span id="an_1:2">1:2</span> Even as they delivered them to us, who from
the beginning were eye-witnesses, and ministers of the word;

<span id="an_1:3">1:3</span> It seemed good to me also, having had
perfect understanding of all things from the very first, to write to
thee in order, most excellent Theophilus,

<span id="an_1:4">1:4</span> That thou mayest know the certainty of
those things in which thou hast been instructed.

<span id="an_1:5">1:5</span> There was in the days of Herod the king of
Judea, a certain priest named Zacharias, of the course of Abia: and his
wife was of the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elisabeth.

<span id="an_1:6">1:6</span> And they were both righteous before God,
walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless.

<span id="an_1:7">1:7</span> And they had no child, because Elisabeth
was barren, and they both were far advanced in years.

<span id="an_1:8">1:8</span> And it came to pass, that, while he
executed the priests' office before God in the order of his course,

<span id="an_1:9">1:9</span> According to the custom of the priests'
office, his lot was to burn incense when he went into the temple of the
Lord.

<span id="an_1:10">1:10</span> And the whole multitude of the people
were praying without, at the time of incense.

<span id="an_1:11">1:11</span> And there appeared to him an angel of the
Lord, standing on the right side of the altar of incense.

<span id="an_1:12">1:12</span> And when Zacharias saw him, he was
troubled, and fear fell upon him.

<span id="an_1:13">1:13</span> But the angel said to him, Fear not,
Zacharias: for thy prayer is heard; and thy wife Elisabeth shall bear
thee a son, and thou shalt call his name John.

<span id="an_1:14">1:14</span> And thou shalt have joy and gladness, and
many shall rejoice at his birth.

<span id="an_1:15">1:15</span> For he shall be great in the sight of the
Lord, and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink; and he shall be
filled with the Holy Spirit, even from his mother's womb.

<span id="an_1:16">1:16</span> And many of the children of Israel shall
he turn to the Lord their God.

<span id="an_1:17">1:17</span> And he shall go before him in the spirit
and power of Elijah, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children,
and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just; to make ready a people
prepared for the Lord.

<span id="an_1:18">1:18</span> And Zacharias said to the angel, By what
shall I know this? for I am an old man, and my wife far advanced in
years.

<span id="an_1:19">1:19</span> And the angel answering, said to him, I
am Gabriel, who stand in the presence of God; and am sent to speak to
thee, and to show thee these glad tidings.

<span id="an_1:20">1:20</span> And behold, thou shalt be dumb, and not
able to speak, until the day that these things shall be performed,
because thou believest not my words which shall be fulfilled in their
season.

<span id="an_1:21">1:21</span> And the people waited for Zacharias, and
marveled that he tarried so long in the temple.

<span id="an_1:22">1:22</span> And when he came out, he could not speak
to them: and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple; for
he beckoned to them, and remained speechless.

<span id="an_1:23">1:23</span> And it came to pass, that as soon as the
days of his ministration were accomplished, he departed to his own
house.

<span id="an_1:24">1:24</span> And after those days his wife Elisabeth
conceived, and secluded herself five months, saying,

<span id="an_1:25">1:25</span> Thus hath the Lord dealt with me in the
days in which he looked on me, to take away my reproach among men.

<span id="an_1:26">1:26</span> And in the sixth month, the angel Gabriel
was sent from God to a city of Galilee, named Nazareth,

<span id="an_1:27">1:27</span> To a virgin espoused to a man whose name
was Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin's name was Mary.

<span id="an_1:28">1:28</span> And the angel came to her, and said,
Hail, thou that art highly favored, the Lord is with thee: blessed art
thou among women.

<span id="an_1:29">1:29</span> And when she saw him, she was troubled at
his saying, and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should
be.

<span id="an_1:30">1:30</span> And the angel said to her, Fear not,
Mary: for thou hast found favor with God.

<span id="an_1:31">1:31</span> And behold, thou shalt conceive in thy
womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt call his name JESUS.

<span id="an_1:32">1:32</span> He will be great, and will be called the
Son of the Highest; and the Lord God will give to him the throne of his
father David.

<span id="an_1:33">1:33</span> And he will reign over the house of Jacob
for ever, and of his kingdom there will be no end.

<span id="an_1:34">1:34</span> Then said Mary to the angel, How shall
this be, seeing I know not a man?

<span id="an_1:35">1:35</span> And the angel answered and said to her,
The Holy Spirit will come upon thee, and the power of the Highest will
overshadow thee: therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of
thee shall be called the Son of God.

<span id="an_1:36">1:36</span> And behold, thy cousin Elisabeth, she
hath also conceived a son in her old age; and this is the sixth month
with her who was called barren:

<span id="an_1:37">1:37</span> For with God nothing will be impossible.

<span id="an_1:38">1:38</span> And Mary said, Behold the handmaid of the
Lord, be it to me according to thy word. And the angel departed from
her.

<span id="an_1:39">1:39</span> And Mary arose in those days, and went
into the hill-country with haste, into a city of Judah,

<span id="an_1:40">1:40</span> And entered into the house of Zacharias,
and saluted Elisabeth.

<span id="an_1:41">1:41</span> And it came to pass, that when Elisabeth
heard the salutation of Mary, the babe leaped in her womb: and Elisabeth
was filled with the Holy Spirit.

<span id="an_1:42">1:42</span> And she spoke with a loud voice, and
said, Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy
womb.

<span id="an_1:43">1:43</span> And whence is this to me, that the mother
of my Lord should come to me?

<span id="an_1:44">1:44</span> For lo, as soon as the voice of thy
salutation sounded in my ears, the babe leaped in my womb for joy.

<span id="an_1:45">1:45</span> And blessed is she that believed that
there will be a performance of those things which were told her from the
Lord.

<span id="an_1:46">1:46</span> And Mary said, My soul doth magnify the
Lord,

<span id="an_1:47">1:47</span> And my spirit hath rejoiced in God my
Savior.

<span id="an_1:48">1:48</span> For he hath regarded the low estate of
his handmaiden: for behold, from henceforth all generations will call me
blessed.

<span id="an_1:49">1:49</span> For he that is mighty hath done to me
great things, and holy is his name.

<span id="an_1:50">1:50</span> And his mercy is on them that fear him,
from generation to generation.

<span id="an_1:51">1:51</span> He hath shown strength with his arm; he
hath scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts.

<span id="an_1:52">1:52</span> He hath put down the mighty from their
seats, and exalted them of low degree.

<span id="an_1:53">1:53</span> He hath filled the hungry with good
things, and the rich he hath sent away empty.

<span id="an_1:54">1:54</span> He hath sustained his servant Israel, in
remembrance of his mercy;

<span id="an_1:55">1:55</span> As he spoke to our fathers, to Abraham,
and to his seed for ever.

<span id="an_1:56">1:56</span> And Mary abode with her about three
months, and returned to her own house.

<span id="an_1:57">1:57</span> Now Elisabeth's full time came that she
should be delivered; and she brought forth a son.

<span id="an_1:58">1:58</span> And her neighbors and her cousins heard
that the Lord had shown great mercy upon her; and they rejoiced with
her.

<span id="an_1:59">1:59</span> And it came to pass, that on the eighth
day they came to circumcise the child; and they called him Zacharias,
after the name of his father.

<span id="an_1:60">1:60</span> And his mother answered and said, Not so;
but he shall be called John.

<span id="an_1:61">1:61</span> And they said to her, There is none of
thy kindred that is called by this name.

<span id="an_1:62">1:62</span> And they made signs to his father, how he
would have him called.

<span id="an_1:63">1:63</span> And he asked for a writing-table, and
wrote, saying, His name is John. And they all wondered.

<span id="an_1:64">1:64</span> And his mouth was opened immediately, and
his tongue loosed, and he spoke, and praised God.

<span id="an_1:65">1:65</span> And fear came on all that dwelt around
them; and all these sayings were noised abroad throughout all the
hill-country of Judea.

<span id="an_1:66">1:66</span> And all they that had heard them, laid
them up in their hearts, saying, What manner of child will this be! And
the hand of the Lord was with him.

<span id="an_1:67">1:67</span> And his father Zacharias was filled with
the Holy Spirit, and prophesied, saying,

<span id="an_1:68">1:68</span> Blessed be the Lord God of Israel; for he
hath visited and redeemed his people.

<span id="an_1:69">1:69</span> And hath raised up a horn of salvation
for us, in the house of his servant David:

<span id="an_1:70">1:70</span> As he spoke by the mouth of his holy
prophets, who have been since the world began:

<span id="an_1:71">1:71</span> That we should be saved from our enemies,
and from the hand of all that hate us;

<span id="an_1:72">1:72</span> To perform the mercy promised to our
fathers, and to remember his holy covenant:

<span id="an_1:73">1:73</span> The oath which he swore to our father
Abraham,

<span id="an_1:74">1:74</span> That he would grant to us, that we being
delivered out of the hand of our enemies, might serve him without fear,

<span id="an_1:75">1:75</span> In holiness and righteousness before him,
all the days of our life.

<span id="an_1:76">1:76</span> And thou, child, shalt be called the
prophet of the Highest, for thou shalt go before the face of the Lord to
prepare his ways;

<span id="an_1:77">1:77</span> To give knowledge of salvation to his
people, by the remission of their sins,

<span id="an_1:78">1:78</span> Through the tender mercy of our God; by
which the day-spring from on high hath visited us,

<span id="an_1:79">1:79</span> To give light to them that sit in
darkness and in the shades of death, to guide our feet into the way of
peace.

<span id="an_1:80">1:80</span> And the child grew, and became strong in
spirit, and was in the deserts till the day of his showing to Israel.

<span id="an_2:1">2:1</span> And it came to pass in those days, that
there went out a decree from Cesar Augustus, that all the world should
be taxed.

<span id="an_2:2">2:2</span> (And this taxing was first made when
Cyrenius was governor of Syria.)

<span id="an_2:3">2:3</span> And all went to be taxed, every one into
his own city.

<span id="an_2:4">2:4</span> And Joseph also went up from Galilee, out
of the city of Nazareth, into Judea, to the city of David, which is
called Bethlehem; (because he was of the house and lineage of David)

<span id="an_2:5">2:5</span> To be taxed with Mary his espoused wife,
being great with child.

<span id="an_2:6">2:6</span> And so it was, that while they were there,
the days were accomplished that she should be delivered.

<span id="an_2:7">2:7</span> And she brought forth her first-born son,
and wrapped him in swaddling-clothes, and laid him in a manger; because
there was no room for them in the inn.

<span id="an_2:8">2:8</span> And there were in the same country
shepherds abiding in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night.

<span id="an_2:9">2:9</span> And lo, the angel of the Lord came upon
them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them; and they were in
great fear.

<span id="an_2:10">2:10</span> And the angel said to them, Fear not: for
behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy which shall be to all
people.

<span id="an_2:11">2:11</span> For to you is born this day, in the city
of David, a Savior, who is Christ the Lord.

<span id="an_2:12">2:12</span> And this shall be a sign to you; Ye shall
find the babe wrapped in swaddling-clothes, lying in a manger.

<span id="an_2:13">2:13</span> And suddenly there was with the angel a
multitude of the heavenly host praising God, and saying,

<span id="an_2:14">2:14</span> Glory to God in the highest, and on earth
peace, good will towards men.

<span id="an_2:15">2:15</span> And it came to pass, when the angels had
departed from them into heaven, the shepherds said one to another, Let
us now go even to Bethlehem, and see this thing which is come to pass,
which the Lord hath made known to us.

<span id="an_2:16">2:16</span> And they came with haste, and found Mary
and Joseph, and the babe lying in a manger.

<span id="an_2:17">2:17</span> And when they had seen it, they made
known abroad the saying which was told them concerning this child.

<span id="an_2:18">2:18</span> And all they that heard it, wondered at
those things which were told them by the shepherds.

<span id="an_2:19">2:19</span> But Mary kept all these things, and
pondered them in her heart.

<span id="an_2:20">2:20</span> And the shepherds returned, glorifying
and praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen, as it
was told to them.

<span id="an_2:21">2:21</span> And when eight days were accomplished for
the circumcising of the child, his name was called JESUS, who was so
named by the angel before he was conceived in the womb.

<span id="an_2:22">2:22</span> And when the days of her purification
according to the law of Moses were accomplished, they brought him to
Jerusalem, to present him to the Lord;

<span id="an_2:23">2:23</span> (As it is written in the law of the Lord,
Every male that is the first born of his mother shall be called holy to
the Lord)

<span id="an_2:24">2:24</span> And to offer a sacrifice according to
that which is said in the law of the Lord, A pair of turtle-doves, or
two young pigeons.

<span id="an_2:25">2:25</span> And behold, there was a man in Jerusalem,
whose name was Simeon; and the same man was just and devout, waiting for
the consolation of Israel: and the Holy Spirit was upon him.

<span id="an_2:26">2:26</span> And it was revealed to him by the Holy
Spirit, that he should not see death, before he had seen the Lord's
Christ.

<span id="an_2:27">2:27</span> And he came by the spirit into the
temple; and when the parents brought in the child Jesus, to do for him
after the custom of the law,

<span id="an_2:28">2:28</span> Then he took him up in his arms, and
blessed God, and said,

<span id="an_2:29">2:29</span> Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart
in peace, according to thy word:

<span id="an_2:30">2:30</span> For my eyes have seen thy salvation,

<span id="an_2:31">2:31</span> Which thou hast prepared before the face
of all people;

<span id="an_2:32">2:32</span> A light to enlighten the Gentiles, and
the glory of thy people Israel.

<span id="an_2:33">2:33</span> And Joseph and his mother marveled at
those things which were spoken concerning him.

<span id="an_2:34">2:34</span> And Simeon blessed them, and said to Mary
his mother, Behold, this child is set for the fall and rising again of
many in Israel; and for a sign which shall be spoken against;

<span id="an_2:35">2:35</span> (And a sword shall pierce through thy own
soul also) that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed.

<span id="an_2:36">2:36</span> And there was one Anna, a prophetess, the
daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher: she was of a great age, and
had lived with a husband seven years from her virginity;

<span id="an_2:37">2:37</span> And she was a widow of about eighty four
years, who departed not from the temple, but served God with fastings
and prayers night and day.

<span id="an_2:38">2:38</span> And she coming in that instant, gave
thanks likewise to the Lord, and spoke of him to all them that looked
for redemption in Jerusalem.

<span id="an_2:39">2:39</span> And when they had performed all things
according to the law of the Lord, they returned into Galilee, to their
own city Nazareth.

<span id="an_2:40">2:40</span> And the child grew, and became strong in
spirit, filled with wisdom: and the grace of God was upon him.

<span id="an_2:41">2:41</span> Now his parents went to Jerusalem every
year at the feast of the passover.

<span id="an_2:42">2:42</span> And when he was twelve years old, they
went up to Jerusalem according to the custom of the feast.

<span id="an_2:43">2:43</span> And when they had fulfilled the days, as
they returned, the child Jesus tarried behind in Jerusalem; and Joseph
and his mother knew not of it.

<span id="an_2:44">2:44</span> But they, supposing him to be in the
company, went a day's journey; and they sought him among their relations
and acquaintance.

<span id="an_2:45">2:45</span> And when they found him not, they
returned to Jerusalem, seeking him.

<span id="an_2:46">2:46</span> And it came to pass, that after three
days they found him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the doctors,
both hearing them, and asking them questions.

<span id="an_2:47">2:47</span> And all that heard him were astonished at
his understanding and answers.

<span id="an_2:48">2:48</span> And when they saw him, they were amazed:
and his mother said to him, Son, why hast thou thus dealt with us?
behold, thy father and I have sought thee sorrowing.

<span id="an_2:49">2:49</span> And he said to them, How is it that ye
sought me? knew ye not that I must be about my Father's business?

<span id="an_2:50">2:50</span> And they understood not the saying which
he spoke to them.

<span id="an_2:51">2:51</span> And he went down with them, and came to
Nazareth, and was subject to them: but his mother kept all these sayings
in her heart.

<span id="an_2:52">2:52</span> And Jesus increased in wisdom and
stature, and in favor with God and man.

<span id="an_3:1">3:1</span> Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of
Tiberius Cesar, Pontius Pilate being governor of Judea, and Herod being
tetrarch of Galilee, and his brother Philip tetrarch of Iturea and of
the region of Trachonitis, and Lysanius the tetrarch of Abilene,

<span id="an_3:2">3:2</span> Annas and Caiaphas being the high priests,
the word of God came to John the son of Zacharias in the wilderness.

<span id="an_3:3">3:3</span> And he came into all the country about
Jordan, preaching the baptism of repentance, for the remission of sins;

<span id="an_3:4">3:4</span> As it is written in the book of the words
of Isaiah the prophet, saying, The voice of one crying in the
wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.

<span id="an_3:5">3:5</span> Every valley shall be filled, and every
mountain and hill shall be brought low; and the crooked shall be made
straight, and the rough ways shall be made smooth;

<span id="an_3:6">3:6</span> And all flesh shall see the salvation of
God.

<span id="an_3:7">3:7</span> Then said he to the multitude that came
forth to be baptized by him, O generation of vipers, who hath warned you
to flee from the wrath to come?

<span id="an_3:8">3:8</span> Bring forth therefore fruits worthy of
repentance, and begin not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham for
our father: for I say to you, that God is able of these stones to raise
up children to Abraham.

<span id="an_3:9">3:9</span> And now also the ax is laid to the root of
the trees: every tree therefore which bringeth not forth good fruit, is
hewn down, and cast into the fire.

<span id="an_3:10">3:10</span> And the people asked him, saying, What
shall we do then?

<span id="an_3:11">3:11</span> He answereth and saith to them, He that
hath two coats, let him impart to him that hath none; and he that hath
provisions, let him do likewise.

<span id="an_3:12">3:12</span> Then came also publicans to be baptized,
and said to him, Master, what shall we do?

<span id="an_3:13">3:13</span> And he said to them, Exact no more than
that which is appointed you.

<span id="an_3:14">3:14</span> And the soldiers likewise asked him,
saying, And what shall we do? And he said to them, Do violence to no
man, neither accuse any falsely, and be content with your wages.

<span id="an_3:15">3:15</span> And as the people were in expectation,
and all men mused in their hearts concerning John, whether he was the
Christ, or not;

<span id="an_3:16">3:16</span> John answered, saying to them all, I
indeed baptize you with water; but one mightier than I cometh, the
latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to unloose: he will baptize you
with the Holy Spirit, and with fire:

<span id="an_3:17">3:17</span> Whose fan is in his hand, and he will
thoroughly cleanse his floor, and will gather the wheat into his
granary; but the chaff he will burn with fire unquenchable.

<span id="an_3:18">3:18</span> And many other things in his exhortation
he preached to the people.

<span id="an_3:19">3:19</span> But Herod the tetrarch, being reproved by
him on account of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife, and for all the
evils which Herod had done,

<span id="an_3:20">3:20</span> Added yet this above all, that he shut up
John in prison.

<span id="an_3:21">3:21</span> Now when all the people were baptized, it
came to pass, that Jesus also being baptized, and praying, the heaven
was opened,

<span id="an_3:22">3:22</span> And the Holy Spirit descended in a bodily
shape like a dove upon him, and a voice came from heaven, which said,
Thou art my beloved Son; in thee I am well pleased.

<span id="an_3:23">3:23</span> And Jesus himself began to be about
thirty years of age, being (as was supposed) the son of Joseph, who was
the son of Heli,

<span id="an_3:24">3:24</span> Who was the son of Matthat, who was the
son of Levi, who was the son of Melchi, who was the son of Janna, who
was the son of Joseph,

<span id="an_3:25">3:25</span> Who was the son of Mattathias, who was
the son of Amos, who was the son of Naum, who was the son of Esli, who
was the son of Nagge,

<span id="an_3:26">3:26</span> Who was the son of Maath, who was the son
of Mattathias, who was the son of Semei, who was the son of Joseph, who
was the son of Juda,

<span id="an_3:27">3:27</span> Who was the son of Joanna, who was the
son of Rhesa, who was the son of Zorobabel, who was the son of
Salathiel, who was the son of Neri,

<span id="an_3:28">3:28</span> Who was the son of Melchi, who was the
son of Addi, who was the son of Cosam, who was the son of Elmodam, who
was the son of Er,

<span id="an_3:29">3:29</span> Who was the son of Jose, who was the son
of Eliezer, who was the son of Jorim, who was the son of Matthat, who
was the son of Levi,

<span id="an_3:30">3:30</span> Who was the son of Simeon, who was the
son of Judah, who was the son of Joseph, who was the son of Jonan, who
was the son of Eliakim,

<span id="an_3:31">3:31</span> Who was the son of Melea, who was the son
of Menan, who was the son of Mattatha, who was the son of Nathan, who
was the son of David,

<span id="an_3:32">3:32</span> Who was the son of Jesse, who was the son
of Obed, who was the son of Booz, who was the son of Salmon, who was the
son of Naasson,

<span id="an_3:33">3:33</span> Who was the son of Aminadab, who was the
son of Aram, who was the son of Esrom, who was the son of Phares, who
was the son of Judah,

<span id="an_3:34">3:34</span> Who was the son of Jacob, who was the son
of Isaac, who was the son of Abraham, who was the son of Terah, who was
the son of Nahor,

<span id="an_3:35">3:35</span> Who was the son of Serug, who was the son
of Reu, who was the son of Peleg, who was the son of Heber, who was the
son of Sala,

<span id="an_3:36">3:36</span> Who was the son of Cainan, who was the
son of Arphaxad, who was the son of Shem, who was the son of Noah, who
was the son of Lamech,

<span id="an_3:37">3:37</span> Who was the son of Methuselah, who was
the son of Enoch, who was the son of Jared, who was the son of Maleleel,
who was the son of Cainan,

<span id="an_3:38">3:38</span> Who was the son of Enos, who was the son
of Seth, who was the son of Adam, who was the son of God.

<span id="an_4:1">4:1</span> And Jesus being full of the Holy Spirit,
returned from Jordan, and was led by the Spirit into the wilderness,

<span id="an_4:2">4:2</span> Being forty days tempted by the devil. And
in those days he ate nothing; and when they were ended, he was afterward
hungry.

<span id="an_4:3">4:3</span> And the devil said to him, If thou art the
Son of God, command this stone that it be made bread.

<span id="an_4:4">4:4</span> And Jesus answered him, saying, It is
written, That man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word of
God.

<span id="an_4:5">4:5</span> And the devil taking him up upon a high
mountain, showed to him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of
time.

<span id="an_4:6">4:6</span> And the devil said to him, All this power
will I give thee, and the glory of them: for that is delivered to me,
and to whomsoever I will, I give it.

<span id="an_4:7">4:7</span> If thou therefore wilt worship me, all
shall be thine.

<span id="an_4:8">4:8</span> And Jesus answered and said to him, Get
thee behind me, Satan: for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord
thy God, and him only shalt thou serve.

<span id="an_4:9">4:9</span> And he brought him to Jerusalem, and set
him on a pinnacle of the temple, and said to him, If thou art the son of
God, cast thyself down from hence.

<span id="an_4:10">4:10</span> For it is written, He will give his
angels charge over thee, to keep thee:

<span id="an_4:11">4:11</span> And in their hands they will bear thee
up, lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone.

<span id="an_4:12">4:12</span> And Jesus answering, said to him, It is
said, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.

<span id="an_4:13">4:13</span> And when the devil had ended all the
temptation, he departed from him for a season.

<span id="an_4:14">4:14</span> And Jesus returned in the power of the
spirit into Galilee: and there went out a fame of him through all the
surrounding region.

<span id="an_4:15">4:15</span> And he taught in their synagogues, being
glorified by all.

<span id="an_4:16">4:16</span> And he came to Nazareth, where he had
been brought up: and, as his custom was, he went into the synagogue on
the sabbath, and stood up to read.

<span id="an_4:17">4:17</span> And there was delivered to him the book
of the prophet Isaiah. And when he had opened the book, he found the
place where it was written,

<span id="an_4:18">4:18</span> The spirit of the Lord is upon me,
because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor; he hath
sent me to heal the broken-hearted, to preach deliverance to the
captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them
that are bruised,

<span id="an_4:19">4:19</span> To preach the acceptable year of the
Lord.

<span id="an_4:20">4:20</span> And he closed the book, and he gave it
again to the minister, and sat down. And the eyes of all them that were
in the synagogue were fastened on him.

<span id="an_4:21">4:21</span> And he began to say to them, This day is
this scripture fulfilled in your ears.

<span id="an_4:22">4:22</span> And all bore him testimony, and wondered
at the gracious words which proceeded out of his mouth. And they said,
Is not this Joseph's son?

<span id="an_4:23">4:23</span> And he said to them, Ye will surely say
to me this proverb, Physician, heal thyself: whatever we have heard done
in Capernaum, do also here in thy country.

<span id="an_4:24">4:24</span> And he said, Verily I say to you, No
prophet is accepted in his own country.

<span id="an_4:25">4:25</span> But I tell you in truth, many widows were
in Israel in the days of Elijah, when the heaven was shut three years
and six months when great famine was throughout all the land:

<span id="an_4:26">4:26</span> But to none of them was Elijah sent, save
to Sarepta, a city of Sidon, to a woman that was a widow.

<span id="an_4:27">4:27</span> And many lepers were in Israel in the
time of Elisha the prophet; and none of them was cleansed, saving Naaman
the Syrian.

<span id="an_4:28">4:28</span> And all they in the synagogue, when they
heard these things, were filled with wrath,

<span id="an_4:29">4:29</span> And rose up, and thrust him out of the
city, and led him to the brow of the hill on which their city was built,
that they might cast him down headlong.

<span id="an_4:30">4:30</span> But he passing through the midst of them,
went away,

<span id="an_4:31">4:31</span> And came down to Capernaum, a city of
Galilee, and taught them on the sabbath-days.

<span id="an_4:32">4:32</span> And they were astonished at his doctrine:
for his word was with power.

<span id="an_4:33">4:33</span> And in the synagogue there was a man who
had a spirit of an unclean demon; and he cried out with a loud voice,

<span id="an_4:34">4:34</span> Saying, Let us alone; what have we to do
with thee, Jesus of Nazareth? art thou come to destroy us? I know thee
who thou art, the Holy One of God.

<span id="an_4:35">4:35</span> And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy
peace, and come out of him. And when the demon had thrown him in the
midst, he came out of him, and hurt him not.

<span id="an_4:36">4:36</span> And they were all amazed, and spoke among
themselves, saying, What a word is this! for with authority and power he
commandeth the unclean spirits, and they come out.

<span id="an_4:37">4:37</span> And the fame of him went out into every
place of the surrounding country.

<span id="an_4:38">4:38</span> And he arose out of the synagogue, and
entered into Simon's house. And the mother of Simon's wife was taken
with a violent fever; and they besought him for her.

<span id="an_4:39">4:39</span> And he stood over her, and rebuked the
fever; and it left her: and immediately she arose and ministered to
them.

<span id="an_4:40">4:40</span> Now when the sun was setting, all they
that had any sick with divers diseases, brought them to him: and he laid
his hands on every one of them, and healed them.

<span id="an_4:41">4:41</span> And demons also came out of many, crying
out, and saying, Thou art Christ the Son of God. And he rebuking them,
suffered them not to speak: for they knew that he was Christ.

<span id="an_4:42">4:42</span> And when it was day, he departed, and
went into a desert place; and the people sought him, and came to him,
and stayed him, that he should not depart from them.

<span id="an_4:43">4:43</span> And he said to them, I must preach the
kingdom of God to other cities also, for therefore am I sent.

<span id="an_4:44">4:44</span> And he preached in the synagogues of
Galilee.

<span id="an_5:1">5:1</span> And it came to pass, that as the people
pressed upon him to hear the word of God, he stood by the lake of
Gennesaret.

<span id="an_5:2">5:2</span> And saw two boats standing by the lake: but
the fishermen had gone out of them, and were washing their nets.

<span id="an_5:3">5:3</span> And he entered into one of the boats, which
was Simon's, and prayed him that he would thrust out a little from the
land. And he sat down, and taught the people out of the boat.

<span id="an_5:4">5:4</span> Now when he had left speaking, he said to
Simon, Lanch out into the deep, and let down your nets for a draught.

<span id="an_5:5">5:5</span> And Simon answering said to him, Master, we
have toiled all the night, and have taken nothing; nevertheless, at thy
word I will let down the net.

<span id="an_5:6">5:6</span> And when they had done this, they inclosed
a great multitude of fishes: and their net broke.

<span id="an_5:7">5:7</span> And they beckoned to their partners, who
were in the other boat, that they should come and help them. And they
came, and filled both the boats, so that they began to sink.

<span id="an_5:8">5:8</span> When Simon Peter saw it, he fell down at
Jesus' knees, saying, Depart from me; for I am a sinful man, O Lord.

<span id="an_5:9">5:9</span> For he was astonished, and all that were
with him, at the draught of the fishes which they had taken:

<span id="an_5:10">5:10</span> And so was also James and John the sons
of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon. And Jesus said to Simon, Fear
not: from henceforth thou shalt catch men.

<span id="an_5:11">5:11</span> And when they had brought their boats to
land, they forsook all, and followed him.

<span id="an_5:12">5:12</span> And it came to pass, when he was in a
certain city, behold, a man full of leprosy: who seeing Jesus, fell on
his face, and besought him, saying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make
me clean.

<span id="an_5:13">5:13</span> And he put forth his hand, and touched
him, saying, I will: Be thou clean. And immediately the leprosy departed
from him.

<span id="an_5:14">5:14</span> And he charged him to tell no man: but
go, and show thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing,
according as Moses commanded for a testimony to them.

<span id="an_5:15">5:15</span> But so much the more a fame of him went
abroad: and great multitudes came together to hear and to be healed by
him of their infirmities.

<span id="an_5:16">5:16</span> And he withdrew himself into the
wilderness, and prayed.

<span id="an_5:17">5:17</span> And it came to pass on a certain day, as
he was teaching, that there were Pharisees and doctors of the law
sitting by, who had come out of every town of Galilee, and Judea, and
Jerusalem: and the power of the Lord was present to heal them.

<span id="an_5:18">5:18</span> And behold, men brought in a bed a man
who was taken with the palsy: and they sought means to bring him in, and
to lay him before him.

<span id="an_5:19">5:19</span> And when they could not find by what way
they might bring him in, because of the multitude, they went upon the
house-top, and let him down through the tiling with his couch, into the
midst before Jesus.

<span id="an_5:20">5:20</span> And when he saw their faith, he said to
him, Man, thy sins are forgiven thee.

<span id="an_5:21">5:21</span> And the scribes and the Pharisees began
to reason, saying, Who is this who speaketh blasphemies? Who can forgive
sins but God alone?

<span id="an_5:22">5:22</span> But when Jesus perceived their thoughts,
he answering, said to them, What reason ye in your hearts?

<span id="an_5:23">5:23</span> Which is easier, to say, Thy sins are
forgiven thee; or to say, Rise and walk?

<span id="an_5:24">5:24</span> But that ye may know that the Son of man
hath power upon earth to forgive sins, He said to the sick with the
palsy, I say to thee, Arise, and take up thy couch, and go into thy
house.

<span id="an_5:25">5:25</span> And immediately he arose before them, and
took up that on which he lay, and departed to his own house, glorifying
God.

<span id="an_5:26">5:26</span> And they were all amazed, and they
glorified God, and were filled with fear, saying, We have seen strange
things to-day.

<span id="an_5:27">5:27</span> And after these things he went forth, and
saw a publican named Levi, sitting at the receipt of custom: and he said
to him, Follow me.

<span id="an_5:28">5:28</span> And he left all, arose, and followed him.

<span id="an_5:29">5:29</span> And Levi made him a great feast in his
own house; and there was a great company of publicans, and of others
that sat down with them.

<span id="an_5:30">5:30</span> But their scribes and Pharisees murmured
against his disciples, saying, Why do ye eat and drink with publicans
and sinners?

<span id="an_5:31">5:31</span> And Jesus answering, said to them, They
that are well need not a physician; but they that are sick.

<span id="an_5:32">5:32</span> I came not to call the righteous, but
sinners to repentance.

<span id="an_5:33">5:33</span> And they said to him, Why do the
disciples of John fast often, and make prayers, and likewise the
disciples of the Pharisees; but thine eat and drink?

<span id="an_5:34">5:34</span> And he said to them, Can ye make the
children of the bride-chamber fast, while the bridegroom is with them?

<span id="an_5:35">5:35</span> But the days will come, when the
bridegroom shall be taken from them, and then they will fast in those
days.

<span id="an_5:36">5:36</span> And he spoke also a parable to them: No
man putteth a piece of a new garment upon an old: if otherwise, then
both the new maketh a rent, and the piece that was taken out of the new,
agreeth not with the old.

<span id="an_5:37">5:37</span> And no man putteth new wine into old
bottles; else the new wine will burst the bottles, and be spilled, and
the bottles will perish.

<span id="an_5:38">5:38</span> But new wine must be put into new
bottles, and both are preserved.

<span id="an_5:39">5:39</span> No man also having drank old wine,
immediately desireth new: for he saith, The old is better.

<span id="an_6:1">6:1</span> And it came to pass on the second sabbath
after the first, that he went through corn-fields; and his disciples
plucked the ears of corn, and ate, rubbing them in their hands.

<span id="an_6:2">6:2</span> And certain of the Pharisees said to them,
Why do ye that which it is not lawful to do on the sabbath-days?

<span id="an_6:3">6:3</span> And Jesus answering them, said, Have ye not
read so much as this, what David did, when himself was hungry, and they
who were with him;

<span id="an_6:4">6:4</span> How he went into the house of God, and took
and ate the show-bread, and gave also to them that were with him, which
it is not lawful to eat but for the priests alone?

<span id="an_6:5">6:5</span> And he said to them, That the Son of man is
Lord also of the sabbath.

<span id="an_6:6">6:6</span> And it came to pass also on another
sabbath, that he entered into the synagogue, and taught: and there was a
man whose right hand was withered:

<span id="an_6:7">6:7</span> And the scribes and Pharisees watched him,
to see whether he would heal on the sabbath; that they might find an
accusation against him.

<span id="an_6:8">6:8</span> But he knew their thoughts, and said to the
man who had the withered hand, Rise, and stand forth in the midst. And
he arose, and stood forth.

<span id="an_6:9">6:9</span> Then said Jesus to them, I will ask you one
thing; Is it lawful on the sabbath-days to do good, or to do evil? to
save life, or to destroy it?

<span id="an_6:10">6:10</span> And looking around upon them all, he said
to the man, Stretch forth thy hand. And he did so: and his hand was
restored whole as the other.

<span id="an_6:11">6:11</span> And they were filled with madness; and
communed one with another what they might do to Jesus.

<span id="an_6:12">6:12</span> And it came to pass in those days, that
he went out to a mountain to pray, and continued all night in prayer to
God.

<span id="an_6:13">6:13</span> And when it was day, he called to him his
disciples: and of them he chose twelve, whom also he named Apostles;

<span id="an_6:14">6:14</span> Simon (whom he also named Peter) and
Andrew his brother, James and John, and Philip and Bartholomew,

<span id="an_6:15">6:15</span> Matthew and Thomas, James the son of
Alpheus, and Simon called Zelotes,

<span id="an_6:16">6:16</span> And Judas the brother of James, and Judas
Iscariot, who also was the traitor.

<span id="an_6:17">6:17</span> And he came down with them, and stood in
the plain; and the company of his disciples, and a great multitude of
people out of all Judea and Jerusalem, and from the sea-coast of Tyre
and Sidon, who came to hear him, and to be healed of their diseases;

<span id="an_6:18">6:18</span> And they that were afflicted with unclean
spirits: and they were healed.

<span id="an_6:19">6:19</span> And the whole multitude sought to touch
him; for there went virtue out of him, and healed them all.

<span id="an_6:20">6:20</span> And he lifted up his eyes on his
disciples, and said, Blessed are ye poor: for yours is the kingdom of
God.

<span id="an_6:21">6:21</span> Blessed are ye that hunger now: for ye
shall be filled. Blessed are ye that weep now: for ye shall laugh.

<span id="an_6:22">6:22</span> Blessed are ye when men shall hate you,
and when they shall separate you from their company, and shall reproach
you, and cast out your name as evil, on account of the son of man.

<span id="an_6:23">6:23</span> Rejoice ye in that day, and leap for joy:
for behold, your reward is great in heaven: for in the like manner did
their fathers to the prophets.

<span id="an_6:24">6:24</span> But woe to you that are rich! for ye have
received your consolation.

<span id="an_6:25">6:25</span> Woe to you that are full! for ye shall
hunger. Woe to you that laugh now! for ye shall mourn and weep.

<span id="an_6:26">6:26</span> Woe to you, when all men shall speak well
of you! for so did their fathers to the false prophets.

<span id="an_6:27">6:27</span> But I say to you who hear, Love your
enemies, do good to them who hate you,

<span id="an_6:28">6:28</span> Bless them that curse you, and pray for
them who despitefully use you.

<span id="an_6:29">6:29</span> And to him that smiteth thee on the one
cheek, offer also the other; and him that taketh away thy cloke, forbid
not to take thy coat also.

<span id="an_6:30">6:30</span> Give to every man that asketh of thee;
and of him that taketh away thy goods, ask them not again.

<span id="an_6:31">6:31</span> And as ye would that men should do to
you, do ye also to them likewise.

<span id="an_6:32">6:32</span> For if ye love them who love you, what
thanks have ye? for sinners also love those that love them.

<span id="an_6:33">6:33</span> And if ye do good to them who do good to
you, what thanks have ye? for sinners also do even the same.

<span id="an_6:34">6:34</span> And if ye lend to them from whom ye hope
to receive, what thanks have ye? for sinners also lend to sinners, to
receive as much in return.

<span id="an_6:35">6:35</span> But love ye your enemies, and do good,
and lend, hoping for nothing again; and your reward shall be great, and
ye shall be the children of the Highest: for he is kind to the
unthankful and to the evil.

<span id="an_6:36">6:36</span> Be ye therefore merciful, as your Father
also is merciful.

<span id="an_6:37">6:37</span> Judge not, and ye shall not be judged:
condemn not, and ye shall not be condemned: forgive, and ye shall be
forgiven:

<span id="an_6:38">6:38</span> Give, and it shall be given to you; good
measure, pressed down, and shaken together, and running over, shall men
give into your bosom. For with the same measure that ye give to others,
it shall be measured to you again.

<span id="an_6:39">6:39</span> And he spoke a parable to them; Can the
blind lead the blind? will they not both fall into the ditch?

<span id="an_6:40">6:40</span> The disciple is not above his master: but
every one that is perfect, shall be as his master.

<span id="an_6:41">6:41</span> And why beholdest thou the mote that is
in thy brother's eye, but perceivest not the beam that is in thy own
eye?

<span id="an_6:42">6:42</span> Either how canst thou say to thy brother,
Brother, let me pull out the mote that is in thy eye, when thou thyself
beholdest not the beam that is in thy own eye? Thou hypocrite, cast out
first the beam out of thy own eye, and then shalt thou see clearly to
pull out the mote that is in thy brother's eye.

<span id="an_6:43">6:43</span> For a good tree bringeth not forth
corrupt fruit; neither doth a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.

<span id="an_6:44">6:44</span> For every tree is known by its own fruit:
for from thorns men do not gather figs, nor from a bramble bush do they
gather grapes.

<span id="an_6:45">6:45</span> A good man out of the good treasure of
his heart, bringeth forth that which is good; and an evil man out of the
evil treasure of his heart, bringeth forth that which is evil: for from
the abundance of the heart his mouth speaketh.

<span id="an_6:46">6:46</span> And why call ye me Lord, Lord, and do not
the things which I say?

<span id="an_6:47">6:47</span> Whoever cometh to me, and heareth my
sayings, and doeth them, I will show you to whom he is like.

<span id="an_6:48">6:48</span> He is like a man who built a house, and
digged deep, and laid the foundation on a rock: and when the flood
arose, the stream beat vehemently upon that house, and could not shake
it: for it was founded upon a rock.

<span id="an_6:49">6:49</span> But he that heareth, and doeth not, is
like a man that, without a foundation, built a house on the earth,
against which the stream beat vehemently, and immediately it fell, and
the ruin of that house was great.

<span id="an_7:1">7:1</span> Now when he had ended all his sayings in
the audience of the people, he entered into Capernaum.

<span id="an_7:2">7:2</span> And a certain centurion's servant, who was
dear to him, was sick, and ready to die.

<span id="an_7:3">7:3</span> And when he heard of Jesus, he sent to him
the elders of the Jews, beseeching him that he would come and heal his
servant.

<span id="an_7:4">7:4</span> And when they came to Jesus, they besought
him earnestly, saying, That he was worthy for whom he should do this:

<span id="an_7:5">7:5</span> For he loveth our nation, and he hath built
us a synagogue.

<span id="an_7:6">7:6</span> Then Jesus went with them. And when he was
now not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to him, saying to
him, Lord, trouble not thyself: for I am not worthy that thou shouldest
enter under my roof;

<span id="an_7:7">7:7</span> Wherefore neither thought I myself worthy
to come to thee; but say in a word, and my servant shall be healed.

<span id="an_7:8">7:8</span> For I also am a man set under authority,
having under me soldiers, and I say to one, Go, and he goeth; and to
another, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth
it.

<span id="an_7:9">7:9</span> When Jesus heard these things, he marveled
at him, and turned himself about and said to the people that followed
him, I say to you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel.

<span id="an_7:10">7:10</span> And they that were sent, returning to the
house, found the servant well that had been sick.

<span id="an_7:11">7:11</span> And it came to pass the day after, that
he went into a city called Nain: and many of his disciples went with
him, and many people.

<span id="an_7:12">7:12</span> Now when he came nigh to the gate of the
city, behold, there was a dead man carried out, the only son of his
mother, and she was a widow: and many people of the city were with her.

<span id="an_7:13">7:13</span> And when the Lord saw her, he had
compassion on her, and said to her, Weep not.

<span id="an_7:14">7:14</span> And he came and touched the bier: And
they that bore him stood still. And he said, Young man, I say to thee,
Arise.

<span id="an_7:15">7:15</span> And he that was dead sat up, and began to
speak, and he delivered him to his mother.

<span id="an_7:16">7:16</span> And there came a fear on all: and they
glorified God, saying, That a great prophet hath risen among us; and,
That God hath visited his people.

<span id="an_7:17">7:17</span> And this rumor of him went forth
throughout all Judea, and throughout all the neighboring region.

<span id="an_7:18">7:18</span> And the disciples of John informed him of
all these things.

<span id="an_7:19">7:19</span> And John calling two of his disciples
sent them to Jesus, saying, Art thou he that should come? or look we for
another?

<span id="an_7:20">7:20</span> When the men had come to him, they said,
John the Baptist hath sent us to thee, saying, Art thou he that should
come? or look we for another?

<span id="an_7:21">7:21</span> And in that same hour he cured many of
their infirmities, and diseases, and of evil spirits; and to many that
were blind he gave sight.

<span id="an_7:22">7:22</span> Then Jesus answering, said to them, Go,
and tell John what things ye have seen and heard; that the blind see,
the lame walk, lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised,
to the poor the gospel is preached.

<span id="an_7:23">7:23</span> And blessed is he, to whom I shall not be
a stumbling block.

<span id="an_7:24">7:24</span> And when the messengers of John had
departed, he began to speak to the people concerning John, What went ye
out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken with the wind?

<span id="an_7:25">7:25</span> But what went ye out to see? A man
clothed in soft raiment? behold, they who are gorgeously appareled, and
live delicately, are in kings' courts.

<span id="an_7:26">7:26</span> But what went ye out to see? A prophet?
Yes, I say to you, and much more than a prophet.

<span id="an_7:27">7:27</span> This is he, concerning whom it is
written, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, who shall prepare
thy way before thee.

<span id="an_7:28">7:28</span> For I say to you, Among those that are
born of women, there is not a greater prophet than John the Baptist: but
he that is least in the kingdom of God, is greater than he.

<span id="an_7:29">7:29</span> And all the people that heard him, and
the publicans, justified God, being baptized with the baptism of John.

<span id="an_7:30">7:30</span> But the Pharisees and lawyers rejected
the counsel of God against themselves, being not baptized by him.

<span id="an_7:31">7:31</span> And the Lord said, To what then shall I
liken the men of this generation? and to what are they like?

<span id="an_7:32">7:32</span> They are like children sitting in the
market-place, and calling one to another, and saying, We have piped to
you, and ye have not danced; we have mourned to you, and ye have not
wept.

<span id="an_7:33">7:33</span> For John the Baptist came neither eating
bread, nor drinking wine; and ye say, He hath a demon.

<span id="an_7:34">7:34</span> The Son of man is come eating and
drinking; and ye say, Behold, a gluttonous man, and a wine-bibber, a
friend of publicans and sinners.

<span id="an_7:35">7:35</span> But wisdom is justified by all her
children.

<span id="an_7:36">7:36</span> And one of the Pharisees desired him that
he would eat with him. And he went into the Pharisee's house, and sat
down at table.

<span id="an_7:37">7:37</span> And behold, a woman in the city, who was
a sinner, when she knew that Jesus sat at table in the Pharisee's house,
brought an alabaster-box of ointment,

<span id="an_7:38">7:38</span> And stood at his feet behind him weeping,
and began to wash his feet with tears, and wiped them with the hairs of
her head, and kissed his feet, and anointed them with the ointment.

<span id="an_7:39">7:39</span> Now when the Pharisee who had invited
him, saw it, he spoke within himself, saying, This man, if he were a
prophet, would have known who, and what manner of woman this is that
toucheth him, for she is a sinner.

<span id="an_7:40">7:40</span> And Jesus answering, said to him, Simon,
I have somewhat to say to thee. And he saith, Master, speak.

<span id="an_7:41">7:41</span> There was a certain creditor, who had two
debtors: the one owed five hundred pence, and the other fifty.

<span id="an_7:42">7:42</span> And when they had nothing to pay, he
frankly forgave them both. Tell me therefore, which of them will love
him most?

<span id="an_7:43">7:43</span> Simon answered and said, I suppose that
he, to whom he forgave most. And he said to him, Thou hast rightly
judged.

<span id="an_7:44">7:44</span> And he turned to the woman, and said to
Simon, Seest thou this woman? I entered into thy house, thou gavest me
no water for my feet: but she hath washed my feet with tears, and wiped
them with the hairs of her head.

<span id="an_7:45">7:45</span> Thou gavest me no kiss: but this woman,
since the time I came in, hath not ceased to kiss my feet.

<span id="an_7:46">7:46</span> My head with oil thou didst not anoint:
but this woman hath anointed my feet with ointment.

<span id="an_7:47">7:47</span> Wherefore I say to thee, Her sins, which
are many, are forgiven; for she loved much: but to whom little is
forgiven, the same loveth little.

<span id="an_7:48">7:48</span> And he said to her, Thy sins are
forgiven.

<span id="an_7:49">7:49</span> And they that sat at table with him,
began to say within themselves, Who is this that forgiveth sins also?

<span id="an_7:50">7:50</span> And he said to the woman, Thy faith hath
saved thee; go in peace.

<span id="an_8:1">8:1</span> And it came to pass afterward, that he went
throughout every city and village, preaching and showing the glad
tidings of the kingdom of God: and the twelve were with him,

<span id="an_8:2">8:2</span> And certain women, who had been healed of
evil spirits and infirmities, Mary called Magdalene, out of whom went
seven demons.

<span id="an_8:3">8:3</span> And Joanna the wife of Chuza Herod's
steward, and Susanna, and many others, who ministered to him of their
substance.

<span id="an_8:4">8:4</span> And when many people were collected, and
had come to him out of every city, he spoke by a parable:

<span id="an_8:5">8:5</span> A sower went out to sow his seed: and as he
sowed, some fell by the way side; and it was trodden down, and the fowls
of the air devoured it.

<span id="an_8:6">8:6</span> And some fell upon a rock; and as soon as
it was sprung up, it withered, because it lacked moisture.

<span id="an_8:7">8:7</span> And some fell among thorns; and the thorns
sprang up with it, and choked it.

<span id="an_8:8">8:8</span> And other fell on good ground, and sprang
up, and bore fruit a hundred-fold. And when he had said these things, he
cried, He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.

<span id="an_8:9">8:9</span> And his disciples asked him, saying, What
doth this parable mean?

<span id="an_8:10">8:10</span> And he said, To you it is given to know
the mysteries of the kingdom of God: but to others in parables; that
seeing they may not see, and hearing they may not understand.

<span id="an_8:11">8:11</span> Now the parable is this: The seed is the
word of God.

<span id="an_8:12">8:12</span> Those by the way side, are they that
hear; then cometh the devil, and taketh away the word out of their
hearts, lest they should believe and be saved.

<span id="an_8:13">8:13</span> They on the rock are they, who, when they
hear, receive the word with joy; and these have no root, who for a while
believe, and in time of temptation fall away.

<span id="an_8:14">8:14</span> And that which fell among thorns are
they, who, when they have heard, go forth, and are choked with cares and
riches and pleasures of this life, and bring no fruit to perfection.

<span id="an_8:15">8:15</span> But that on the good ground are they, who
in an honest and good heart, having heard the word, keep it, and bring
forth fruit with patience.

<span id="an_8:16">8:16</span> No man, when he hath lighted a candle,
covereth it with a vessel, or putteth it under a bed; but setteth it on
a candlestick, that they who enter in may see the light.

<span id="an_8:17">8:17</span> For nothing is secret, that shall not be
made manifest; neither any thing hid, that shall not be known, and come
abroad.

<span id="an_8:18">8:18</span> Take heed therefore how ye hear: for
whoever hath, to him shall be given; and whoever hath not, from him
shall be taken even that which he seemeth to have.

<span id="an_8:19">8:19</span> Then came to him his mother and his
brethren, and could not come near to him for the crowd.

<span id="an_8:20">8:20</span> And it was told to him by certain, who
said, Thy mother and thy brethren stand without, desiring to see thee.

<span id="an_8:21">8:21</span> And he answered and said to them, My
mother and my brethren are these who hear the word of God, and do it.

<span id="an_8:22">8:22</span> Now it came to pass on a certain day,
that he went into a boat with his disciples: and he said to them, Let us
go over to the other side of the lake. And they lanched forth.

<span id="an_8:23">8:23</span> But as they sailed, he fell asleep: and
there came down a storm of wind on the lake; and they were filled with
water, and were in jeopardy.

<span id="an_8:24">8:24</span> And they came to him, and awoke him,
saying, Master, master, we perish. Then he arose, and rebuked the wind,
and the raging of the water: and they ceased, and there was a calm.

<span id="an_8:25">8:25</span> And he said to them, Where is your faith?
And they being afraid, wondered, saying one to another, What manner of
man is this! for he commandeth even the winds and water, and they obey
him.

<span id="an_8:26">8:26</span> And they arrived at the country of the
Gadarenes, which is over against Galilee.

<span id="an_8:27">8:27</span> And when he went forth to land, there met
him out of the city a certain man, who had demons a long time, and wore
no clothes, neither abode in any house, but in the tombs.

<span id="an_8:28">8:28</span> When he saw Jesus, he cried out, and fell
down before him, and with a loud voice said, What have I to do with
thee, Jesus, thou Son of God most high? I beseech thee torment me not.

<span id="an_8:29">8:29</span> (For he had commanded the unclean spirit
to come out of the man. For often it had caught him, and he was kept
bound with chains, and in fetters: and he broke the bands, and was
driven by the demon into the wilderness.)

<span id="an_8:30">8:30</span> And Jesus asked him, saying, What is thy
name? And he said, Legion: because many demons had entered into him.

<span id="an_8:31">8:31</span> And they besought him, that he would not
command them to go out into the deep.

<span id="an_8:32">8:32</span> And there was there a herd of many swine
feeding on the mountain: and they besought him that he would suffer them
to enter into them. And he suffered them.

<span id="an_8:33">8:33</span> Then the demons went out of the man, and
entered into the swine: and the herd ran violently down a steep place
into the lake, and were choked.

<span id="an_8:34">8:34</span> When they that fed them saw what was
done, they fled, and went and told it in the city and in the country.

<span id="an_8:35">8:35</span> Then they went out to see what was done;
and came to Jesus, and found the man out of whom the demons had
departed, sitting at the feet of Jesus, clothed, and in his right mind:
and they were afraid.

<span id="an_8:36">8:36</span> They also who saw it, told them by what
means he that was possessed by the demons was healed.

<span id="an_8:37">8:37</span> Then the whole multitude of the
surrounding country of the Gadarenes, besought him to depart from them:
for they were taken with great fear. And he went into the boat, and
returned.

<span id="an_8:38">8:38</span> Now the man out of whom the demons had
departed, besought him that he might be with him. But Jesus sent him
away, saying,

<span id="an_8:39">8:39</span> Return to thy own house, and show how
great things God hath done to thee. And he went away and published
throughout the whole city, how great things Jesus had done to him.

<span id="an_8:40">8:40</span> And it came to pass, that, when Jesus had
returned, the people gladly received him: for they were all waiting for
him.

<span id="an_8:41">8:41</span> And behold, there came a man named
Jairus, and he was a ruler of the synagogue: and he fell down at the
feet of Jesus, and besought him that he would come into his house:

<span id="an_8:42">8:42</span> For he had one daughter only, about
twelve years of age, and she lay dying. (But as he was going, the people
thronged him.

<span id="an_8:43">8:43</span> And a woman having an issue of blood
twelve years, who had spent all her living upon physicians, neither
could be healed by any,

<span id="an_8:44">8:44</span> Came behind him, and touched the border
of his garment: and immediately her issue of blood stanched.

<span id="an_8:45">8:45</span> And Jesus said, Who touched me? When all
denied, Peter, and they that were with him, said, Master, the multitude
throng thee, and press thee, and sayest thou, Who touched me?

<span id="an_8:46">8:46</span> And Jesus said, Somebody hath touched me:
for I perceive that virtue hath gone out of me.

<span id="an_8:47">8:47</span> And when the woman saw that she was not
hid, she came trembling, and falling down before him, she declared to
him before all the people for what cause she had touched him, and how
she was healed immediately.

<span id="an_8:48">8:48</span> And he said to her, Daughter, be of good
comfort: thy faith hath made thee whole; go in peace.

<span id="an_8:49">8:49</span> While he was yet speaking, there cometh
one from the house of the ruler of the synagogue, saying to him, Thy
daughter is dead: trouble not the Master.

<span id="an_8:50">8:50</span> But when Jesus heard it, he answered him,
saying, Fear not: believe only, and she shall be healed.

<span id="an_8:51">8:51</span> And when he came into the house, he
suffered no man to go in, save Peter, and James, and John, and the
father and the mother of the maiden.

<span id="an_8:52">8:52</span> And all wept and bewailed her: but he
said, Weep not: she is not dead, but sleepeth.

<span id="an_8:53">8:53</span> And they derided him, knowing that she
was dead.

<span id="an_8:54">8:54</span> And he put them all out, and took her by
the hand, and called, saying, Maid, arise.

<span id="an_8:55">8:55</span> And her spirit came again, and she arose
immediately: and he commanded to give her food.

<span id="an_8:56">8:56</span> And her parents were astonished: but he
charged them that they should tell no man what was done.

<span id="an_9:1">9:1</span> Then he called his twelve disciples
together, and gave them power and authority over all demons, and to cure
diseases.

<span id="an_9:2">9:2</span> And he sent them to preach the kingdom of
God, and to heal the sick.

<span id="an_9:3">9:3</span> And he said to them, Take nothing for your
journey, neither staffs, nor bag, neither bread, neither money; neither
have two coats apiece.

<span id="an_9:4">9:4</span> And into whatever house ye enter, there
abide, and thence depart.

<span id="an_9:5">9:5</span> And whoever will not receive you, when ye
go out of that city, shake off the very dust from your feet for a
testimony against them.

<span id="an_9:6">9:6</span> And they departed, and went through the
towns, preaching the gospel, and healing every where.

<span id="an_9:7">9:7</span> Now Herod the tetrarch heard of all that
was done by him: and he was perplexed, because that it was said by some,
that John had risen from the dead;

<span id="an_9:8">9:8</span> And by some, that Elijah had appeared; and
by others, that one of the ancient prophets had risen again.

<span id="an_9:9">9:9</span> And Herod said, John have I beheaded; but
who is this of whom I hear such things? And he desired to see him.

<span id="an_9:10">9:10</span> And the apostles, when they had returned,
told him all that they had done. And he took them, and went aside
privately into a desert place, belonging to the city called Bethsaida.

<span id="an_9:11">9:11</span> And the people, when they knew it,
followed him: and he received them, and spoke to them of the kingdom of
God, and healed them that had need of healing.

<span id="an_9:12">9:12</span> And when the day began to decline, then
came the twelve, and said to him, Send the multitude away, that they may
go into the towns and country around, and lodge, and get victuals: for
we are here in a desert place.

<span id="an_9:13">9:13</span> But he said to them, Give ye them to eat.
And they said, We have no more than five loaves and two fishes; except
we should go and buy provisions for all this people.

<span id="an_9:14">9:14</span> For they were about five thousand men.
And he said to his disciples, Make them sit down by fifties in a
company.

<span id="an_9:15">9:15</span> And they did so, and made them all sit
down.

<span id="an_9:16">9:16</span> Then he took the five loaves, and the two
fishes, and looking up to heaven, he blessed them, and broke, and gave
to the disciples to set before the multitude.

<span id="an_9:17">9:17</span> And they ate, and were all satisfied: and
there was taken up of fragments that remained to them, twelve baskets.

<span id="an_9:18">9:18</span> And it came to pass, as he was in
retirement praying, his disciples were with him; and he asked them,
saying, Who say the people that I am?

<span id="an_9:19">9:19</span> They answering, said, John the Baptist;
but some say, Elijah; and others say, that one of the ancient prophets
is risen again.

<span id="an_9:20">9:20</span> He said to them, But who say ye that I
am? Peter answering, said, Christ of God.

<span id="an_9:21">9:21</span> And he strictly charged them, and
commanded them to tell no man that thing,

<span id="an_9:22">9:22</span> Saying, The Son of man must suffer many
things, and be rejected by the elders, and chief priests, and scribes,
and be put to death, and be raised the third day.

<span id="an_9:23">9:23</span> And he said to them all, If any man will
come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and
follow me.

<span id="an_9:24">9:24</span> For whoever will save his life, shall
lose it: but whoever will lose his life for my sake, the same shall save
it.

<span id="an_9:25">9:25</span> For what is a man profited, if he shall
gain the whole world, and lose himself, or be cast away?

<span id="an_9:26">9:26</span> For whoever shall be ashamed of me, and
of my words, of him will the Son of man be ashamed, when he shall come
in his own glory, and in that of his Father, and of the holy angels.

<span id="an_9:27">9:27</span> But I tell you in truth, there are some
standing here who shall not taste death till they see the kingdom of
God.

<span id="an_9:28">9:28</span> And it came to pass, about eight days
after these sayings, he took Peter, and John, and James, and went up
upon a mountain to pray.

<span id="an_9:29">9:29</span> And as he prayed, the fashion of his
countenance was altered, and his raiment was white and glistening.

<span id="an_9:30">9:30</span> And behold, there talked with him two
men, who were Moses and Elijah.

<span id="an_9:31">9:31</span> Who appeared in glory, and spoke of his
decease which he should accomplish at Jerusalem.

<span id="an_9:32">9:32</span> But Peter and they that were with him
were heavy with sleep: and when they were awake, they saw his glory, and
the two men that stood with him.

<span id="an_9:33">9:33</span> And it came to pass, as they departed
from him, Peter said to Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here: and
let us make three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one
for Elijah: not knowing what he said.

<span id="an_9:34">9:34</span> While he was thus speaking, there came a
cloud and overshadowed them: and they feared as they entered into the
cloud.

<span id="an_9:35">9:35</span> And there came a voice out of the cloud,
saying, This is my beloved Son: hear him.

<span id="an_9:36">9:36</span> And when the voice was past, Jesus was
found alone. And they kept it close, and told no man in those days any
of those things which they had seen.

<span id="an_9:37">9:37</span> And it came to pass, that on the next
day, when they had come down from the hill, many people met him.

<span id="an_9:38">9:38</span> And behold, a man of the company cried
out, saying, Master, I beseech thee look upon my son: for he is my only
child.

<span id="an_9:39">9:39</span> And lo, a spirit taketh him, and he
suddenly crieth out; and it teareth him that he foameth, and bruising
him, hardly departeth from him.

<span id="an_9:40">9:40</span> And I besought thy disciples to cast him
out, and they could not.

<span id="an_9:41">9:41</span> And Jesus answering, said, O faithless
and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you, and suffer you?
Bring thy son hither.

<span id="an_9:42">9:42</span> And as he was yet coming, the demon threw
him down, and tore him. And Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and healed
the child, and delivered him again to his father.

<span id="an_9:43">9:43</span> And they were all amazed at the mighty
power of God. But while they were all wondering at all things which
Jesus did, he said to his disciples,

<span id="an_9:44">9:44</span> Let these sayings sink down into your
ears: for the Son of man will be delivered into the hands of men.

<span id="an_9:45">9:45</span> But they understood not this saying, and
it was hid from them, that they perceived it not: and they feared to ask
him concerning that saying.

<span id="an_9:46">9:46</span> Then there arose a reasoning among them,
which of them should be greatest.

<span id="an_9:47">9:47</span> And Jesus perceiving the thought of their
heart, took a child, and set him by him,

<span id="an_9:48">9:48</span> And said to them, Whoever shall receive
this child in my name, receiveth me; and whoever shall receive me,
receiveth him that sent me: for he that is least among you all, the same
shall be great.

<span id="an_9:49">9:49</span> And John answered and said, Master, we
saw one casting out demons in thy name; and we forbad him, because he
followeth not with us.

<span id="an_9:50">9:50</span> And Jesus said to him, Forbid him not:
for he that is not against us, is for us.

<span id="an_9:51">9:51</span> And it came to pass, when the time was
come that he should be received up, he steadfastly set his face to go to
Jerusalem,

<span id="an_9:52">9:52</span> And sent messengers before his face: and
they went and entered into a village of the Samaritans, to make ready
for him.

<span id="an_9:53">9:53</span> And they did not receive him, because his
face was as though he would go to Jerusalem.

<span id="an_9:54">9:54</span> And when his disciples James and John saw
this, they said, Lord, wilt thou that we command fire to come down from
heaven, and consume them, even as Elijah did?

<span id="an_9:55">9:55</span> But he turned, and rebuked them, and
said, Ye know not what manner of spirit ye are of.

<span id="an_9:56">9:56</span> For the Son of man is not come to destroy
men's lives, but to save them. And they went to another village.

<span id="an_9:57">9:57</span> And it came to pass, that as they were
going in the way, a certain man said to him, Lord, I will follow thee
whithersoever thou goest.

<span id="an_9:58">9:58</span> And Jesus said to him, Foxes have holes,
and birds of the air have nests; but the Son of man hath not where to
lay his head.

<span id="an_9:59">9:59</span> And he said to another, Follow me. But he
said, Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my father.

<span id="an_9:60">9:60</span> Jesus said to him, Let the dead bury
their dead: but go thou and preach the kingdom of God.

<span id="an_9:61">9:61</span> And another also said, Lord, I will
follow thee; but let me first go and bid them farewell who are at my
house.

<span id="an_9:62">9:62</span> And Jesus said to him, No man having put
his hand to the plow, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God.

<span id="an_10:1">10:1</span> After these things, the Lord appointed
other seventy also, and sent them two and two before his face into every
city, and place, whither he himself would come.

<span id="an_10:2">10:2</span> Therefore said he to them, The harvest
truly is great, but the laborers are few: pray ye therefore the Lord of
the harvest, that he would send forth laborers into his harvest.

<span id="an_10:3">10:3</span> Go: behold, I send you forth as lambs
among wolves.

<span id="an_10:4">10:4</span> Carry neither purse, nor sack, nor shoes:
and salute no man by the way.

<span id="an_10:5">10:5</span> And into whatever house ye enter, first
say, Peace be to this house.

<span id="an_10:6">10:6</span> And if the son of peace be there, your
peace shall rest upon it: if not, it shall turn to you again.

<span id="an_10:7">10:7</span> And in the same house remain, eating and
drinking such things as they give: for the laborer is worthy of his
hire. Go not from house to house.

<span id="an_10:8">10:8</span> And into whatever city ye enter, and they
receive you, eat such things as are set before you.

<span id="an_10:9">10:9</span> And heal the sick that are therein, and
say to them, The kingdom of God is come nigh to you.

<span id="an_10:10">10:10</span> But into whatever city ye enter, and
they receive you not, go out into the streets of the same, and say,

<span id="an_10:11">10:11</span> Even the very dust of your city which
cleaveth on us, we do wipe off against you: notwithstanding, be ye sure
of this, that the kingdom of God is come nigh to you.

<span id="an_10:12">10:12</span> But I say to you, that it shall be more
tolerable in that day for Sodom than for that city.

<span id="an_10:13">10:13</span> Woe to thee, Chorazin! woe to thee
Bethsaida! for if the mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon,
which have been done in you, they had a great while ago repented sitting
in sackcloth and ashes.

<span id="an_10:14">10:14</span> But it shall be more tolerable for Tyre
and Sidon at the judgment, than for you.

<span id="an_10:15">10:15</span> And thou, Capernaum, which art exalted
to heaven, shall be thrust down to hell.

<span id="an_10:16">10:16</span> He that heareth you, heareth me; and he
that despiseth you, despiseth me; and he that despiseth me, despiseth
him that sent me.

<span id="an_10:17">10:17</span> And the seventy returned with joy,
saying, Lord, even the demons are subject to us through thy name.

<span id="an_10:18">10:18</span> And he said to them, I beheld Satan as
lightning fall from heaven.

<span id="an_10:19">10:19</span> Behold, I give to you power to tread on
serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy: and nothing
shall by any means hurt you.

<span id="an_10:20">10:20</span> Notwithstanding in this rejoice not,
that the spirits are subject to you; but rather rejoice, because your
names are written in heaven.

<span id="an_10:21">10:21</span> In that hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit,
and said, I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that thou
hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them
to babes: even so, Father; for so it seemed good in thy sight.

<span id="an_10:22">10:22</span> All things are delivered to me by my
Father: and no man knoweth who the Son is, but the Father; and who the
Father is, but the Son, and he to whom the Son will reveal him.

<span id="an_10:23">10:23</span> And he turned himself to his disciples,
and said privately, Blessed are the eyes which see the things that ye
see.

<span id="an_10:24">10:24</span> For I tell you, that many prophets and
kings have desired to see the things which ye see, and have not seen
them; and to hear the things which ye hear, and have not heard them.

<span id="an_10:25">10:25</span> And behold, a certain lawyer stood up,
and tempted him, saying, Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal
life?

<span id="an_10:26">10:26</span> He said to him, What is written in the
law? how readest thou?

<span id="an_10:27">10:27</span> And he answering said, Thou shalt love
the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all
thy strength, and with all thy mind; and thy neighbor as thyself.

<span id="an_10:28">10:28</span> And he said to him, Thou hast answered
right: this do, and thou shalt live.

<span id="an_10:29">10:29</span> But he, willing to justify himself,
said to Jesus, And who is my neighbor?

<span id="an_10:30">10:30</span> And Jesus answering said, A certain man
went down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among robbers, who
stripped him of his raiment, and wounded him, and departed, leaving him
half dead.

<span id="an_10:31">10:31</span> And by chance there came down a certain
priest that way; and when he saw him, he passed by on the other side.

<span id="an_10:32">10:32</span> And likewise a Levite, when he was at
the place, came and looked on him, and passed by on the other side.

<span id="an_10:33">10:33</span> But a certain Samaritan, as he
journeyed, came were he was: and when he saw him, he had compassion on
him,

<span id="an_10:34">10:34</span> And went to him, and bound up his
wounds, pouring in oil and wine, and set him on his own beast, and
brought him to an inn, and took care of him.

<span id="an_10:35">10:35</span> And on the morrow, when he departed, he
took out two pence, and gave them to the host, and said to him, Take
care of him: and whatever thou spendest more, when I come again, I will
repay thee.

<span id="an_10:36">10:36</span> Which now of these three, thinkest
thou, was neighbor to him that fell among the robbers?

<span id="an_10:37">10:37</span> And he said, He that showed mercy on
him. Then said Jesus to him, Go, and do thou likewise.

<span id="an_10:38">10:38</span> Now it came to pass, as they were
going, he entered into a certain village: and a certain woman, named
Martha, received him into her house.

<span id="an_10:39">10:39</span> And she had a sister called Mary, who
also sat at Jesus' feet, and heard his word.

<span id="an_10:40">10:40</span> But Martha was cumbered about much
serving, and came to him, and said, Lord, dost thou not care that my
sister hath left me to serve alone? bid her therefore that she help me.

<span id="an_10:41">10:41</span> And Jesus answered, and said to her,
Martha, Martha, thou art anxious, and troubled about many things:

<span id="an_10:42">10:42</span> But one thing is needful; and Mary hath
chosen that good part, which shall not be taken away from her.

<span id="an_11:1">11:1</span> And it came to pass, that as he was
praying in a certain place, when he ceased, one of his disciples said to
him, Lord, teach us to pray, as John also taught his disciples.

<span id="an_11:2">11:2</span> And he said to them, When ye pray, say,
Our Father who art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come.
Thy will be done, as in heaven, so on earth.

<span id="an_11:3">11:3</span> Give us day by day our daily bread.

<span id="an_11:4">11:4</span> And forgive us our sins; for we also
forgive every one that is indebted to us. And lead us not into
temptation; but deliver us from evil.

<span id="an_11:5">11:5</span> And he said to them, Which of you shall
have a friend, and shall go to him at midnight, and say to him, Friend,
lend me three loaves:

<span id="an_11:6">11:6</span> For a friend of mine in his journey is
come to me, and I have nothing to set before him?

<span id="an_11:7">11:7</span> And he from within shall answer and say,
Trouble me not: the door is now shut, and my children are with me in
bed; I cannot rise and give thee.

<span id="an_11:8">11:8</span> I say to you, Though he will not rise and
give him, because he is his friend, yet because of his importunity he
will rise and give him as many as he needeth.

<span id="an_11:9">11:9</span> And I say to you, Ask, and it shall be
given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and the door shall be opened
to you.

<span id="an_11:10">11:10</span> For every one that asketh, receiveth;
and he that seeketh, findeth; and to him that knocketh, the door shall
be opened.

<span id="an_11:11">11:11</span> If a son shall ask bread of any of you
that is a father, will he give him a stone? or if he shall ask a fish,
will he for a fish give him a serpent?

<span id="an_11:12">11:12</span> Or if he shall ask an egg, will he
offer him a scorpion?

<span id="an_11:13">11:13</span> If ye then, being evil, know how to
give good gifts to your children: how much more will your heavenly
Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him?

<span id="an_11:14">11:14</span> And he was casting out a demon, and it
was dumb. And it came to pass when the demon was gone out, the dumb
spoke; and the people wondered.

<span id="an_11:15">11:15</span> But some of them said, He casteth out
demons through Beelzebub, the chief of the demons.

<span id="an_11:16">11:16</span> And others tempting him, sought from
him a sign from heaven.

<span id="an_11:17">11:17</span> But he, knowing their thoughts, said to
them, Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and
a house divided against a house falleth.

<span id="an_11:18">11:18</span> If Satan also is divided against
himself, how shall his kingdom stand? because ye say that I cast out
demons through Beelzebub.

<span id="an_11:19">11:19</span> And if I by Beelzebub cast out demons,
by whom do your sons cast them out? therefore shall they be your judges.

<span id="an_11:20">11:20</span> But if I with the finger of God cast
out demons, no doubt the kingdom of God is come upon you.

<span id="an_11:21">11:21</span> When a strong man armed keepeth his
palace, his goods are in peace:

<span id="an_11:22">11:22</span> But when a stronger than he shall come
upon him, and overcome him, he taketh from him all his armor in which he
trusted, and divideth his spoils.

<span id="an_11:23">11:23</span> He that is not with me is against me:
and he that gathereth not with me scattereth.

<span id="an_11:24">11:24</span> When the unclean spirit is gone out of
a man, he walketh through dry places, seeking rest: and finding none, he
saith, I will return to my house whence I came out.

<span id="an_11:25">11:25</span> And when he cometh, he findeth it swept
and garnished.

<span id="an_11:26">11:26</span> Then he goeth and taketh to him seven
other spirits more wicked than himself; and they enter in, and dwell
there: and the last state of that man is worse than the first.

<span id="an_11:27">11:27</span> And it came to pass, as he was speaking
these things, a certain woman of the company lifted up her voice, and
said to him, Blessed is the womb that bore thee, and the paps which
nourished thee.

<span id="an_11:28">11:28</span> But he said, Yes, rather blessed are
they that hear the word of God, and keep it.

<span id="an_11:29">11:29</span> And when the people were assembled in
crowds, he began to say, This is an evil generation: they seek a sign;
and there shall no sign be given to it, but the sign of Jonah the
prophet.

<span id="an_11:30">11:30</span> For as Jonah was a sign to the
Ninevites, so also shall the Son of man be to this generation.

<span id="an_11:31">11:31</span> The queen of the south shall rise up in
the judgment with the men of this generation, and condemn them: for she
came from the utmost parts of the earth, to hear the wisdom of Solomon;
and behold, a greater than Solomon is here.

<span id="an_11:32">11:32</span> The men of Nineveh shall rise up in the
judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: for they repented
at the preaching of Jonah; and behold, a greater than Jonah is here.

<span id="an_11:33">11:33</span> No man when he hath lighted a candle,
putteth it in a secret place, neither under a close vessel, but on a
candlestick, that they who come in may see the light.

<span id="an_11:34">11:34</span> The light of the body is the eye:
therefore when thy eye is single, thy whole body also is full of light;
but when thy eye is evil, thy body also is full of darkness.

<span id="an_11:35">11:35</span> Take heed therefore, that the light
which is in thee be not darkness.

<span id="an_11:36">11:36</span> If thy whole body therefore be full of
light, having no part dark, the whole shall be full of light; as when
the bright shining of a candle doth give thee light.

<span id="an_11:37">11:37</span> And as he was speaking, a certain
Pharisee besought him to dine with him: and he went in, and sat down to
eat.

<span id="an_11:38">11:38</span> And when the Pharisee saw it, he
marveled that he had not first washed before dinner.

<span id="an_11:39">11:39</span> And the Lord said to him, Now do ye
Pharisees make clean the outside of the cup and the platter; but your
inward part is full of ravening and wickedness.

<span id="an_11:40">11:40</span> Ye fools, did not he that made that
which is without, make that which is within also?

<span id="an_11:41">11:41</span> But rather give alms of such things as
ye have; and behold, all things are clean to you.

<span id="an_11:42">11:42</span> But woe to you, Pharisees! for ye tithe
mint, and rue, and all manner of herbs, and pass over judgment and the
love of God: these ought ye to have done, and not to leave the others
undone.

<span id="an_11:43">11:43</span> Woe to you, Pharisees! for ye love the
uppermost seats in the synagogues, and greetings in the markets.

<span id="an_11:44">11:44</span> Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees,
hypocrites! for ye are as graves which appear not, and the men that walk
over them are not aware of them.

<span id="an_11:45">11:45</span> Then answered one of the lawyers, and
said to him, Master, thus saying, thou reproachest us also.

<span id="an_11:46">11:46</span> And he said, Woe to you also, ye
lawyers, for ye load men with burdens grievous to be borne, and ye
yourselves touch not the burdens with one of your fingers.

<span id="an_11:47">11:47</span> Woe to you! for ye build the sepulchers
of the prophets, and your fathers killed them.

<span id="an_11:48">11:48</span> Truly ye bear testimony, that ye allow
the deeds of your fathers: for they indeed killed them, and ye build
their sepulchers.

<span id="an_11:49">11:49</span> Therefore also said the wisdom of God,
I will send them prophets and apostles, and some of them they will slay
and persecute:

<span id="an_11:50">11:50</span> That the blood of all the prophets,
which hath been shed from the foundation of the world, may be required
of this generation;

<span id="an_11:51">11:51</span> From the blood of Abel to the blood of
Zacharias, who perished between the altar and the temple: verily I say
to you, It shall be required of this generation.

<span id="an_11:52">11:52</span> Woe to you, lawyers! for ye have taken
away the key of knowledge: ye have not entered in yourselves, and them
that were entering in ye hindered.

<span id="an_11:53">11:53</span> And as he said these things to them,
the scribes and the Pharisees began to urge him vehemently, and to
solicit him to speak of many things;

<span id="an_11:54">11:54</span> Laying wait for him, and seeking to
catch something from his mouth, that they might accuse him.

<span id="an_12:1">12:1</span> In the mean time, when there was gathered
an innumerable multitude of people, so that they trod one upon another,
he began to say to his disciples first of all, Beware ye of the leaven
of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy.

<span id="an_12:2">12:2</span> For there is nothing covered, that shall
not be revealed; neither hid, that shall not be known.

<span id="an_12:3">12:3</span> Therefore, whatever ye have spoken in
darkness, shall be heard in the light; and that which ye have spoken in
the ear in closets, shall be proclaimed upon the house-tops.

<span id="an_12:4">12:4</span> And I say to you, my friends, Be not
afraid of them that kill the body, and after that have no more that they
can do.

<span id="an_12:5">12:5</span> But I will forewarn you whom ye shall
fear: Fear him, who after he hath killed, hath power to cast into hell;
yes, I say to you, Fear him.

<span id="an_12:6">12:6</span> Are not five sparrows sold for two
farthings, and not one of them is forgotten before God?

<span id="an_12:7">12:7</span> But even the very hairs of your head are
all numbered. Fear not therefore: ye are of more value than many
sparrows.

<span id="an_12:8">12:8</span> Also I say to you, Whoever shall confess
me before men, him will the Son of man also confess before the angels of
God.

<span id="an_12:9">12:9</span> But he that denieth me before men, shall
be denied before the angels of God.

<span id="an_12:10">12:10</span> And whoever shall speak a word against
the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him: but to him that blasphemeth
against the Holy Spirit, it shall not be forgiven.

<span id="an_12:11">12:11</span> And when they bring you to the
synagogues, and before magistrates, and powers, be not solicitous how or
what thing ye shall answer, or what ye shall say:

<span id="an_12:12">12:12</span> For the Holy Spirit will teach you in
the same hour what ye ought to say.

<span id="an_12:13">12:13</span> And one of the company said to him,
Master, speak to my brother, that he divide the inheritance with me.

<span id="an_12:14">12:14</span> And he said to him, Man, who made me a
judge, or a divider over you?

<span id="an_12:15">12:15</span> And he said to them, Take heed, and
beware of covetousness: for a man's life consisteth not in the abundance
of the things which he possesseth.

<span id="an_12:16">12:16</span> And he spoke a parable to them, saying,
The ground of a certain rich man brought forth plentifully:

<span id="an_12:17">12:17</span> And he thought within himself, saying,
What shall I do, because I have no room where to deposit my fruits?

<span id="an_12:18">12:18</span> And he said, This will I do: I will
pull down my barns, and build greater; and there will I deposit all my
fruits and my goods.

<span id="an_12:19">12:19</span> And I will say to my soul, Soul, thou
hast abundance of goods laid up for many years; take thy ease, eat,
drink, and be merry.

<span id="an_12:20">12:20</span> But God said to him, Thou fool, this
night thy soul shall be required of thee: then whose shall those things
be which thou hast provided?

<span id="an_12:21">12:21</span> So is he that layeth up treasure for
himself, and is not rich towards God.

<span id="an_12:22">12:22</span> And he said to his disciples, Therefore
I say to you, Be not anxious for your life, what ye shall eat; neither
for the body, what ye shall put on.

<span id="an_12:23">12:23</span> The life is more than food, and the
body is more than raiment.

<span id="an_12:24">12:24</span> Consider the ravens: for they neither
sow nor reap: which neither have store-house, nor barn; and God feedeth
them: How much more are ye better than the fowls?

<span id="an_12:25">12:25</span> And which of you by solicitude can add
to his stature one cubit?

<span id="an_12:26">12:26</span> If ye then are not able to do that
thing which is least, why are ye anxious for the rest?

<span id="an_12:27">12:27</span> Consider the lilies how they grow: They
toil not, they spin not; and yet I say to you, that Solomon in all his
glory was not arrayed like one of these.

<span id="an_12:28">12:28</span> If then God so clothe the grass, which
is to-day in the field, and to-morrow is cast into the oven; how much
more will he clothe you, O ye of little faith?

<span id="an_12:29">12:29</span> And seek ye not what ye shall eat, or
what ye shall drink, neither be ye of doubtful mind.

<span id="an_12:30">12:30</span> For all these things do the nations of
the world seek after: and your Father knoweth that ye have need of these
things.

<span id="an_12:31">12:31</span> But rather seek ye the kingdom of God,
and all these things shall be added to you.

<span id="an_12:32">12:32</span> Fear not, little flock; for it is your
Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom.

<span id="an_12:33">12:33</span> Sell what ye have, and give alms:
provide yourselves bags which become not old, a treasure in the heavens
that faileth not, where no thief approacheth, neither moth corrupteth.

<span id="an_12:34">12:34</span> For where your treasure is, there will
your heart be also.

<span id="an_12:35">12:35</span> Let your loins be girt, and your lights
burning;

<span id="an_12:36">12:36</span> And ye yourselves like men that wait
for their lord, when he shall return from the wedding; that, when he
cometh and knocketh, they may open to him immediately.

<span id="an_12:37">12:37</span> Blessed are those servants, whom the
lord when he cometh shall find watching: verily I say to you, that he
will gird himself, and make them to sit down to eat, and will come forth
and serve them.

<span id="an_12:38">12:38</span> And if he shall come in the second
watch, or come in the third watch, and find them so, blessed are those
servants.

<span id="an_12:39">12:39</span> And this know, that if the master of
the house knew at what hour the thief would come, he would watch, and
not suffer his house to be broken through.

<span id="an_12:40">12:40</span> Be ye therefore ready also: for the Son
of man cometh at an hour when ye think not.

<span id="an_12:41">12:41</span> Then Peter said to him, Lord, speakest
thou this parable to us, or even to all?

<span id="an_12:42">12:42</span> And the Lord said, Who then is that
faithful and wise steward, whom his lord shall make ruler over his
household, to give them their portion of provisions in due season?

<span id="an_12:43">12:43</span> Blessed is that servant, whom his lord
when he cometh shall find so doing.

<span id="an_12:44">12:44</span> In truth I say to you, that he will
make him ruler over all that he hath.

<span id="an_12:45">12:45</span> But if that servant shall say in his
heart, My lord delayeth his coming; and shall begin to beat the
men-servants, and maidens, and to eat and drink, and to be drunken?

<span id="an_12:46">12:46</span> The lord of that servant will come in a
day when he looketh not for him, and at an hour when he is not aware,
and will cut him asunder, and will appoint him his portion with the
unbelievers.

<span id="an_12:47">12:47</span> And that servant who knew his lord's
will, and prepared not himself, neither did according to his will, shall
be beaten with many stripes.

<span id="an_12:48">12:48</span> But he that knew not, and committed
things worthy of stripes, shall be beaten with few stripes. For to
whomsoever much is given, of him shall much be required: and to whom men
have committed much, from him they will ask the more.

<span id="an_12:49">12:49</span> I am come to send fire on the earth,
and what will I, if it is already kindled?

<span id="an_12:50">12:50</span> But I have a baptism to be baptized
with; and how am I straitened till it shall be accomplished!

<span id="an_12:51">12:51</span> Suppose ye that I am come to give peace
on earth? I tell you, No; but rather division:

<span id="an_12:52">12:52</span> For from henceforth there will be five
in one house divided, three against two, and two against three.

<span id="an_12:53">12:53</span> The father will be divided against the
son, and the son against the father; the mother against the daughter,
and the daughter against the mother; the mother-in-law against her
daughter-in-law, and the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law.

<span id="an_12:54">12:54</span> And he said also to the people, When ye
see a cloud rising in the west, immediately ye say, There cometh a
shower; and so it is.

<span id="an_12:55">12:55</span> And when ye perceive the south wind
blowing, ye say, There will be heat; and it cometh to pass.

<span id="an_12:56">12:56</span> Ye hypocrites, ye can discern the face
of the sky, and of the earth; but how is it, that ye do not discern this
time?

<span id="an_12:57">12:57</span> And why even of yourselves judge ye not
what is right?

<span id="an_12:58">12:58</span> When thou goest with thy adversary to
the magistrate, as thou art in the way, give diligence that thou mayest
be delivered from him; lest he draw thee before the judge, and the judge
deliver thee to the officer, and the officer cast thee into prison.

<span id="an_12:59">12:59</span> I tell thee, thou shalt not depart
thence, till thou hast paid the very last mite.

<span id="an_13:1">13:1</span> There were present at that season some
that told him of the Galileans, whose blood Pilate had mingled with
their sacrifices.

<span id="an_13:2">13:2</span> And Jesus answering, said to them,
Suppose ye that these Galileans were sinners above all the Galileans,
because they suffered such things?

<span id="an_13:3">13:3</span> I tell you, No; but except ye repent, ye
shall all likewise perish.

<span id="an_13:4">13:4</span> Or those eighteen, upon whom the tower in
Siloam fell, and killed them, think ye that they were sinners above all
men that dwelt in Jerusalem?

<span id="an_13:5">13:5</span> I tell you, No; but, except ye repent, ye
shall all likewise perish.

<span id="an_13:6">13:6</span> He spoke also this parable: A certain man
had a fig-tree planted in his vineyard; and he came and sought fruit on
it, and found none.

<span id="an_13:7">13:7</span> Then said he to the dresser of his
vineyard, Behold, these three years I come seeking fruit on this
fig-tree, and find none: cut it down; why cumbereth it the ground?

<span id="an_13:8">13:8</span> And he answering, said to him, Lord, let
it alone this year also, till I shall dig about it, and dung it:

<span id="an_13:9">13:9</span> And if it shall bear fruit, well: and if
not, then after that thou shalt cut it down.

<span id="an_13:10">13:10</span> And he was teaching in one of the
synagogues on the sabbath.

<span id="an_13:11">13:11</span> And behold, there was a woman who had a
spirit of infirmity eighteen years, and was bowed together, and could in
no wise raise herself.

<span id="an_13:12">13:12</span> And when Jesus saw her, he called her
to him, and said to her, Woman, thou art loosed from thy infirmity.

<span id="an_13:13">13:13</span> And he laid his hands on her: and
immediately she was made straight, and glorified God.

<span id="an_13:14">13:14</span> And the ruler of the synagogue answered
with indignation, because Jesus had healed on the sabbath, and said to
the people, There are six days in which men ought to work: in them
therefore come and be healed, and not on the sabbath.

<span id="an_13:15">13:15</span> The Lord then answered him, and said,
Thou hypocrite, doth not each one of you on the sabbath loose his ox or
his ass from the stall, and lead him away to watering?

<span id="an_13:16">13:16</span> And ought not this woman, being a
daughter of Abraham, whom Satan hath bound, lo, these eighteen years, to
be loosed from this bond on the Sabbath?

<span id="an_13:17">13:17</span> And when he had said these things, all
his adversaries were ashamed: and all the people rejoiced for all the
glorious things that were done by him.

<span id="an_13:18">13:18</span> Then said he, To what is the kingdom of
God like? and to what shall I resemble it?

<span id="an_13:19">13:19</span> It is like a grain of mustard-seed,
which a man took, and cast into his garden, and it grew, and became a
great tree; and the fowls of the air lodged in the branches of it.

<span id="an_13:20">13:20</span> And again he said, To what shall I
liken the kingdom of God?

<span id="an_13:21">13:21</span> It is like leaven, which a woman took
and hid in three measures of meal, till the whole was leavened.

<span id="an_13:22">13:22</span> And he went through the cities and
villages, teaching, and journeying towards Jerusalem.

<span id="an_13:23">13:23</span> Then said one to him, Lord, are there
few that are saved? And he said to them,

<span id="an_13:24">13:24</span> Strive to enter in at the strait gate:
for many, I say to you, will seek to enter in, and shall not be able.

<span id="an_13:25">13:25</span> When once the master of the house hath
risen, and hath shut the door, and ye begin to stand without, and to
knock at the door, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us; and he will answer
and say to you, I know you not whence ye are:

<span id="an_13:26">13:26</span> Then ye will begin to say, We have
eaten and drank in thy presence, and thou hast taught in our streets.

<span id="an_13:27">13:27</span> But he will say, I tell you, I know you
not whence ye are: depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity.

<span id="an_13:28">13:28</span> There shall be weeping and gnashing of
teeth when ye shall see Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and all the
prophets in the kingdom of God, and you yourselves excluded.

<span id="an_13:29">13:29</span> And they will come from the east, and
from the west, and from the north, and from the south, and will sit down
in the kingdom of God.

<span id="an_13:30">13:30</span> And behold, there are last, who shall
be first; and there are first who shall be last.

<span id="an_13:31">13:31</span> The same day there came certain of the
Pharisees, saying to him, Go out, and depart hence; for Herod will kill
thee.

<span id="an_13:32">13:32</span> And he said to them, Go ye and tell
that fox, Behold, I cast out demons, and I do cures to-day and
to-morrow, and the third day I shall be perfected.

<span id="an_13:33">13:33</span> Nevertheless, I must walk to-day and
to-morrow, and the day following: for it cannot be that a prophet should
perish out of Jerusalem.

<span id="an_13:34">13:34</span> O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, that killest
the prophets, and stonest them that are sent to thee; how often would I
have gathered thy children, as a hen gathereth her brood under her
wings, and ye would not!

<span id="an_13:35">13:35</span> Behold, your house is left to you
desolate. And verily I say to you, ye shall not see me, until the time
shall come when ye shall say, Blessed is he that cometh in the name of
the Lord.

<span id="an_14:1">14:1</span> And it came to pass, as he went into the
house of one of the chief Pharisees to eat bread on the sabbath, that
they watched him.

<span id="an_14:2">14:2</span> And behold, there was a certain man
before him who had the dropsy.

<span id="an_14:3">14:3</span> And Jesus answering, spoke to the lawyers
and Pharisees, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath?

<span id="an_14:4">14:4</span> And they held their peace. And he took
him and healed him, and let him go;

<span id="an_14:5">14:5</span> And answered them, saying, Which of you
shall have an ass or an ox fallen into a pit, and will not forthwith
pull him out on the sabbath?

<span id="an_14:6">14:6</span> And they could not answer him again to
these things.

<span id="an_14:7">14:7</span> And he put forth a parable to those who
were invited, when he marked how they chose out the chief rooms; saying
to them,

<span id="an_14:8">14:8</span> When thou art invited by any man to a
wedding, sit not down in the highest room, lest a more honorable man
than thou be invited by him;

<span id="an_14:9">14:9</span> And he that invited thee and him, shall
come and say to thee, Give this man place; and thou begin with shame to
take the lowest room.

<span id="an_14:10">14:10</span> But when thou art invited, go and sit
down in the lowest room; that when he that invited thee cometh, he may
say to thee, Friend, go up higher: then shalt thou have honor in the
presence of them that sit at table with thee.

<span id="an_14:11">14:11</span> For whoever exalteth himself shall be
abased, and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.

<span id="an_14:12">14:12</span> Then said he also to him that invited
him, When thou makest a dinner or a supper, call not thy friends, nor
thy brethren, neither thy kinsmen, nor thy rich neighbors; lest they
also invite thee again, and a recompense be made thee.

<span id="an_14:13">14:13</span> But when thou makest a feast, call the
poor, the maimed, the lame, the blind:

<span id="an_14:14">14:14</span> And thou shalt be blessed: for they
cannot recompense thee: for thou shalt be recompensed at the
resurrection of the just.

<span id="an_14:15">14:15</span> And when one of them that sat at table
with him heard these things, he said to him, Blessed is he that shall
eat bread in the kingdom of God.

<span id="an_14:16">14:16</span> Then said he to him, A certain man made
a great supper, and invited many:

<span id="an_14:17">14:17</span> And sent his servant at supper-time, to
say to them that were invited, Come, for all things are now ready.

<span id="an_14:18">14:18</span> And they all with one consent began to
make excuse. The first said to him, I have bought a piece of ground, and
I must needs go and see it: I pray thee have me excused.

<span id="an_14:19">14:19</span> And another said, I have bought five
yoke of oxen, and I go to prove them: I pray thee have me excused.

<span id="an_14:20">14:20</span> And another said, I have married a
wife: and therefore I cannot come.

<span id="an_14:21">14:21</span> So that servant came, and showed his
lord these things. Then the master of the house being angry, said to his
servant, Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city, and
bring in hither the poor, and the maimed, and the halt, and the blind.

<span id="an_14:22">14:22</span> And the servant said, Lord, it is done
as thou hast commanded, and yet there is room.

<span id="an_14:23">14:23</span> And the lord said to the servant, Go
out into the highways and hedges, and compel them to come in, that my
house may be filled.

<span id="an_14:24">14:24</span> For I say to you, that none of those
men who were invited, shall taste my supper.

<span id="an_14:25">14:25</span> And there went great multitudes with
him: and he turned, and said to them,

<span id="an_14:26">14:26</span> If any man cometh to me, and hateth not
his father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and
sisters, yes, and his own life also, he cannot be my disciple.

<span id="an_14:27">14:27</span> And whoever doth not bear his cross,
and come after me, cannot be my disciple.

<span id="an_14:28">14:28</span> For which of you intending to build a
tower, sitteth not down first, and counteth the cost, whether he hath
sufficient to finish it?

<span id="an_14:29">14:29</span> Lest perhaps after he hath laid the
foundation, and is not able to finish it, all that behold it begin to
mock him,

<span id="an_14:30">14:30</span> Saying, This man began to build, and
was not able to finish.

<span id="an_14:31">14:31</span> Or what king going to make war against
another king, sitteth not down first, and consulteth whether he is able
with ten thousand to meet him that cometh against him with twenty
thousand?

<span id="an_14:32">14:32</span> Or else, while the other is yet a great
way off, he sendeth an embassy, and desireth conditions of peace.

<span id="an_14:33">14:33</span> So likewise, whoever he is of you that
forsaketh not all that he hath, he cannot be my disciple.

<span id="an_14:34">14:34</span> Salt is good: but if the salt hath lost
its savor, with what shall it be seasoned?

<span id="an_14:35">14:35</span> It is neither fit for the land, nor yet
for the dunghill, but men cast it out. He that hath ears to hear, let
him hear.

<span id="an_15:1">15:1</span> Then drew near to him all the publicans
and sinners to hear him.

<span id="an_15:2">15:2</span> And the Pharisees and scribes murmured,
saying, This man receiveth sinners, and eateth with them.

<span id="an_15:3">15:3</span> And he spoke this parable to them,
saying,

<span id="an_15:4">15:4</span> What man of you having a hundred sheep,
if he loseth one of them, doth not leave the ninety and nine in the
wilderness, and go after that which is lost, until he findeth it?

<span id="an_15:5">15:5</span> And when he hath found it, he layeth it
on his shoulders, rejoicing.

<span id="an_15:6">15:6</span> And when he cometh home, he calleth
together his friends and neighbors, saying to them, Rejoice with me; for
I have found my sheep which was lost.

<span id="an_15:7">15:7</span> I say to you, that likewise joy shall be
in heaven over one sinner that repenteth, more than over ninety and nine
just persons, who need no repentance.

<span id="an_15:8">15:8</span> Either what woman having ten pieces of
silver, if she loseth one piece, doth not light a candle, and sweep the
house, and seek diligently till she findeth it?

<span id="an_15:9">15:9</span> And when she hath found it, she calleth
her friends and her neighbors together, saying, Rejoice with me; for I
have found the piece which I had lost.

<span id="an_15:10">15:10</span> Likewise, I say to you, There is joy in
the presence of the angels of God over one sinner that repenteth.

<span id="an_15:11">15:11</span> And he said, A certain man had two
sons:

<span id="an_15:12">15:12</span> And the younger of them said to his
father, Father, give me the portion of goods that falleth to me. And he
divided to them his living.

<span id="an_15:13">15:13</span> And not many days after, the younger
son gathered all together, and took his journey into a far country, and
there wasted his substance with riotous living.

<span id="an_15:14">15:14</span> And when he had spent all, there arose
a severe famine in that land; and he began to be in want.

<span id="an_15:15">15:15</span> And he went and joined himself to a
citizen of that country; and he sent him into his fields to feed swine.

<span id="an_15:16">15:16</span> And he would fain have filled his belly
with the husks that the swine did eat; and no man gave to him.

<span id="an_15:17">15:17</span> And when he came to himself, he said,
How many hired servants of my father have bread enough and to spare, and
I am perishing with hunger!

<span id="an_15:18">15:18</span> I will arise and go to my father, and
will say to him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and before thee,

<span id="an_15:19">15:19</span> And am no more worthy to be called thy
son: make me as one of thy hired servants.

<span id="an_15:20">15:20</span> And he arose, and came to his father.
But when he was yet a great way off, his father saw him, and had
compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him.

<span id="an_15:21">15:21</span> And the son said to him, Father, I have
sinned against heaven, and in thy sight, and am no more worthy to be
called thy son.

<span id="an_15:22">15:22</span> But the father said to his servants,
Bring forth the best robe, and put it on him, and put a ring on his
hand, and shoes on his feet:

<span id="an_15:23">15:23</span> And bring hither the fatted calf, and
kill it; and let us eat, and be merry:

<span id="an_15:24">15:24</span> For this my son was dead, and is alive
again; he was lost, and is found. And they began to be merry.

<span id="an_15:25">15:25</span> Now his elder son was in the field: and
as he came and drew nigh to the house, he heard music and dancing.

<span id="an_15:26">15:26</span> And he called one of the servants, and
asked what these things meant.

<span id="an_15:27">15:27</span> And he said to him, Thy brother is
come; and thy father hath killed the fatted calf, because he hath
received him in health.

<span id="an_15:28">15:28</span> And he was angry, and would not go in;
therefore his father came out, and entreated him.

<span id="an_15:29">15:29</span> And he answering, said to his father,
Lo, these many years do I serve thee, neither have I at any time
transgressed thy commandment; and yet thou never gavest me a kid, that I
might make merry with my friends:

<span id="an_15:30">15:30</span> But as soon as this thy son had come,
who hath devoured thy living with harlots, thou hast killed for him the
fatted calf.

<span id="an_15:31">15:31</span> And he said to him, Son, thou art ever
with me: and all that I have is thine.

<span id="an_15:32">15:32</span> It was meet that we should make merry,
and be glad: for this thy brother was dead, and is alive again; and was
lost, and is found.

<span id="an_16:1">16:1</span> And he said also to his disciples, There
was a certain rich man who had a steward; and the same was accused to
him that he had wasted his goods.

<span id="an_16:2">16:2</span> And he called him, and said to him, How
is it that I hear this of thee? give an account of thy stewardship: for
thou mayest be no longer steward.

<span id="an_16:3">16:3</span> Then the steward said within himself,
What shall I do? for my lord taketh from me the stewardship: I cannot
dig; I am ashamed to beg.

<span id="an_16:4">16:4</span> I am resolved what to do, that when I am
removed from the stewardship, they may receive me into their houses.

<span id="an_16:5">16:5</span> So he called every one of his lord's
debtors, and said to the first, How much owest thou to my lord?

<span id="an_16:6">16:6</span> And he said, A hundred measures of oil.
And he said to him, Take thy bill, and sit down quickly, and write
fifty.

<span id="an_16:7">16:7</span> Then said he to another, And how much
owest thou? And he said, A hundred measures of wheat. And he said to
him, Take thy bill, and write eighty.

<span id="an_16:8">16:8</span> And the lord commended the unjust
steward, because he had done wisely: for the children of this world are
in their generation wiser than the children of light.

<span id="an_16:9">16:9</span> And I say to you, Make to yourselves
friends of the mammon of unrighteousness; that when ye fail, they may
receive you into everlasting habitations.

<span id="an_16:10">16:10</span> He that is faithful in that which is
least, is faithful also in much; and he that is unjust in the least, is
unjust also in much.

<span id="an_16:11">16:11</span> If therefore ye have not been faithful
in the unrighteous mammon, who will commit to your trust the true
riches?

<span id="an_16:12">16:12</span> And if ye have not been faithful in
that which is another man's, who will give you that which is your own?

<span id="an_16:13">16:13</span> No servant can serve two masters: for
either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to
the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.

<span id="an_16:14">16:14</span> And the Pharisees also, who were
covetous, heard all these things, and they derided him.

<span id="an_16:15">16:15</span> And he said to them, Ye are they who
justify yourselves before men; but God knoweth your hearts: for that
which is highly esteemed among men, is abomination in the sight of God.

<span id="an_16:16">16:16</span> The law and the prophets were until
John: since that time the kingdom of God is preached, and every man
presseth into it.

<span id="an_16:17">16:17</span> And it is easier for heaven and earth
to pass away, than one tittle of the law to fail.

<span id="an_16:18">16:18</span> Whoever putteth away his wife, and
marrieth another, committeth adultery; and whoever marrieth her that is
put away from her husband, committeth adultery.

<span id="an_16:19">16:19</span> There was a certain rich man, who was
clothed in purple and fine linen, and fared sumptuously every day:

<span id="an_16:20">16:20</span> And there was a certain beggar named
Lazarus, who was laid at his gate, full of sores,

<span id="an_16:21">16:21</span> And desiring to be fed with the crumbs
which fell from the rich man's table: moreover, the dogs came and licked
his sores.

<span id="an_16:22">16:22</span> And it came to pass, that the beggar
died, and was carried by angels into Abraham's bosom. The rich man also
died, and was buried:

<span id="an_16:23">16:23</span> And in hell he lifted up his eyes,
being in torments, and seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom.

<span id="an_16:24">16:24</span> And he cried, and said, Father Abraham,
have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his
finger in water, and cool my tongue: for I am tormented in this flame.

<span id="an_16:25">16:25</span> But Abraham said, Son, remember that
thou in thy life-time receivedst thy good things, and likewise Lazarus
evil things: but now he is comforted, and thou art tormented.

<span id="an_16:26">16:26</span> And besides all this, between us and
you there is a great gulf fixed: so that they who would pass from hence
to you, cannot; neither can they pass to us, that would come from
thence.

<span id="an_16:27">16:27</span> Then he said, I pray thee therefore,
father, that thou wouldst send him to my father's house:

<span id="an_16:28">16:28</span> For I have five brethren; that he may
testify to them, lest they also come into this place of torment.

<span id="an_16:29">16:29</span> Abraham saith to him, They have Moses
and the prophets; let them hear them.

<span id="an_16:30">16:30</span> And he said, No, father Abraham: but if
one shall go to them from the dead, they will repent.

<span id="an_16:31">16:31</span> And he said to him, If they hear not
Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded, though one shall
rise from the dead.

<span id="an_17:1">17:1</span> Then he said to the disciples, It is
impossible but that causes of sin will come: but woe to him by whom they
come!

<span id="an_17:2">17:2</span> It were better for him that a millstone
were hanged about his neck, and he cast into the sea, than that he
should cause one of these little ones to fall into sin.

<span id="an_17:3">17:3</span> Take heed to yourselves: If thy brother
shall trespass against thee, rebuke him; and if he shall repent forgive
him.

<span id="an_17:4">17:4</span> And if he shall trespass against thee
seven times in a day, and seven times in a day shall turn again to thee,
saying, I repent; thou shalt forgive him.

<span id="an_17:5">17:5</span> And the apostles said to the Lord,
Increase our faith.

<span id="an_17:6">17:6</span> And the Lord said, If ye had faith as a
grain of mustard-seed, ye might say to this sycamine-tree, Be thou
plucked up by the root, and be thou planted in the sea; and it would
obey you.

<span id="an_17:7">17:7</span> But which of you having a servant
plowing, or feeding cattle, will say to him immediately, when he is come
from the field, Go and sit down to eat?

<span id="an_17:8">17:8</span> And will not rather say to him, Make
ready wherewith I may sup, and gird thyself, and serve me, till I have
eaten and drank; and afterward thou shalt eat and drink?

<span id="an_17:9">17:9</span> Doth he thank that servant, because he
did the things that were commanded him? I suppose not.

<span id="an_17:10">17:10</span> So likewise ye, when ye shall have done
all the things which are commanded you, say, We are unprofitable
servants: we have done that which it was our duty to do.

<span id="an_17:11">17:11</span> And it came to pass, as he went to
Jerusalem, that he passed through the midst of Samaria and Galilee.

<span id="an_17:12">17:12</span> And as he entered into a certain
village, there met him ten men that were lepers, who stood at a
distance.

<span id="an_17:13">17:13</span> And they lifted up their voices, and
said, Jesus, Master, have mercy on us.

<span id="an_17:14">17:14</span> And when he saw them, he said to them,
Go, show yourselves to the priests. And it came to pass, that as they
were going, they were cleansed.

<span id="an_17:15">17:15</span> And one of them, when he saw that he
was healed, turned back, and with a loud voice glorified God,

<span id="an_17:16">17:16</span> And fell down on his face at his feet,
giving him thanks: and he was a Samaritan.

<span id="an_17:17">17:17</span> And Jesus answering said, Were there
not ten cleansed? but where are the nine?

<span id="an_17:18">17:18</span> There are not found returning to give
glory to God, save this stranger.

<span id="an_17:19">17:19</span> And he said to him, Arise, depart: thy
faith hath made thee whole.

<span id="an_17:20">17:20</span> And when he was asked by the Pharisees,
when the kingdom of God should come, he answered them and said, The
kingdom of God cometh not with observation.

<span id="an_17:21">17:21</span> Neither will they say, Lo here! or lo
there! for behold, the kingdom of God is within you.

<span id="an_17:22">17:22</span> And he said to his disciples, The days
will come, when ye will desire to see one of the days of the son of man,
and ye shall not see it.

<span id="an_17:23">17:23</span> And they will say to you, See here; or,
see there: go not after them, nor follow them.

<span id="an_17:24">17:24</span> For as the lightning that lighteneth
from the one part under heaven, shineth to the other part under heaven;
so shall also the Son of man be in his day.

<span id="an_17:25">17:25</span> But first he must suffer many things,
and be rejected by this generation.

<span id="an_17:26">17:26</span> And as it was in the days of Noah, so
shall it be also in the days of the Son of man.

<span id="an_17:27">17:27</span> They ate, they drank, they married
wives, they were given in marriage, until the day that Noah entered into
the ark; and the flood came, and destroyed them all.

<span id="an_17:28">17:28</span> Likewise also as it was in the days of
Lot: they ate, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they
built;

<span id="an_17:29">17:29</span> But the same day that Lot went out of
Sodom, it rained fire and brimstone from heaven, and destroyed them all:

<span id="an_17:30">17:30</span> Even thus shall it be in the day when
the Son of man is revealed.

<span id="an_17:31">17:31</span> In that day, he who shall be upon the
house-top, and his furniture in the house, let him not come down to take
it away: and he that is in the field, let him likewise not return back.

<span id="an_17:32">17:32</span> Remember Lot's wife.

<span id="an_17:33">17:33</span> Whoever shall seek to save his life,
shall lose it; and whoever shall lose his life, shall preserve it.

<span id="an_17:34">17:34</span> I tell you, in that night there will be
two men in one bed; the one will be taken, and the other will be left.

<span id="an_17:35">17:35</span> Two women will be grinding together;
the one will be taken, and the other left.

<span id="an_17:36">17:36</span> Two men will be in the field; the one
will be taken, and the other left.

<span id="an_17:37">17:37</span> And they answered and said to him,
Where Lord? And he said to them, Wherever the body is, thither will the
eagles be collected.

<span id="an_18:1">18:1</span> And he spoke a parable to them to this
end, that men ought always to pray, and not to faint;

<span id="an_18:2">18:2</span> Saying, There was in a city a judge, who
feared not God, neither regarded man.

<span id="an_18:3">18:3</span> And there was a widow in that city; and
she came to him, saying, Avenge me of my adversary.

<span id="an_18:4">18:4</span> And he would not for a while: but
afterward he said within himself, Though I fear not God, nor regard man;

<span id="an_18:5">18:5</span> Yet because this widow troubleth me, I
will avenge her, lest by her continual coming she weary me.

<span id="an_18:6">18:6</span> And the Lord said, Hear what the unjust
judge saith.

<span id="an_18:7">18:7</span> And will not God avenge his own elect,
who cry day and night to him, though he beareth long with them?

<span id="an_18:8">18:8</span> I tell you that he will avenge them
speedily. Nevertheless, when the Son of man cometh, will he find faith
on the earth?

<span id="an_18:9">18:9</span> And he spoke this parable to certain who
trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and despised others:

<span id="an_18:10">18:10</span> Two men went up into the temple to
pray; the one a Pharisee, and the other a publican.

<span id="an_18:11">18:11</span> The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with
himself, God, I thank thee, that I am not as other men are,
extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this publican.

<span id="an_18:12">18:12</span> I fast twice in the week, I give tithes
of all that I possess.

<span id="an_18:13">18:13</span> And the publican, standing afar off,
would not lift up so much as his eyes to heaven, but smote upon his
breast, saying, God be merciful to me a sinner.

<span id="an_18:14">18:14</span> I tell you, this man went down to his
house justified rather than the other: for every one that exalteth
himself shall be abased; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.

<span id="an_18:15">18:15</span> And they brought to him also infants,
that he would touch them: but when his disciples saw it, they rebuked
them.

<span id="an_18:16">18:16</span> But Jesus called them to him, and said,
Suffer little children to come to me, and forbid them not: for of such
is the kingdom of God.

<span id="an_18:17">18:17</span> Verily I say to you, Whoever shall not
receive the kingdom of God as a little child, shall in no wise enter
into it.

<span id="an_18:18">18:18</span> And a certain ruler asked him, saying,
Good Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?

<span id="an_18:19">18:19</span> And Jesus said to him, Why callest thou
me good? none is good, save one, that is God.

<span id="an_18:20">18:20</span> Thou knowest the commandments, Do not
commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness,
Honor thy father and thy mother.

<span id="an_18:21">18:21</span> And he said, All these have I kept from
my youth.

<span id="an_18:22">18:22</span> Now when Jesus heard these things, he
said to him, Yet lackest thou one thing: sell all that thou hast, and
distribute to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and
come, follow me.

<span id="an_18:23">18:23</span> And when he heard this, he was very
sorrowful: for he was very rich.

<span id="an_18:24">18:24</span> And when Jesus saw that he was very
sorrowful, he said, How hardly will they that have riches enter into the
kingdom of God!

<span id="an_18:25">18:25</span> For it is easier for a camel to go
through a needle's eye, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of
God.

<span id="an_18:26">18:26</span> And they that heard it, said, Who then
can be saved?

<span id="an_18:27">18:27</span> Then he said, The things which are
impossible with men, are possible with God.

<span id="an_18:28">18:28</span> Then Peter said, Lo, we have left all,
and followed thee.

<span id="an_18:29">18:29</span> And he said to them, Verily I say to
you, there is no man that hath left house, or parents, or brethren, or
wife, or children for the sake of the kingdom of God,

<span id="an_18:30">18:30</span> Who shall not receive manifold more in
this present time, and in the world to come life everlasting.

<span id="an_18:31">18:31</span> Then he took the twelve, and said to
them, Behold, we go up to Jerusalem, and all things that are written by
the prophets concerning the Son of man shall be accomplished.

<span id="an_18:32">18:32</span> For he will be delivered to the
Gentiles, and will be mocked, and spitefully treated, and spitted on;

<span id="an_18:33">18:33</span> And they will scourge him, and put him
to death: and the third day he will rise again.

<span id="an_18:34">18:34</span> And they understood none of these
things: and this saying was hid from them, neither knew they the things
which were spoken.

<span id="an_18:35">18:35</span> And it came to pass, that as he had
come nigh to Jericho, a certain blind man sat by the way side begging;

<span id="an_18:36">18:36</span> And hearing the multitude passing by,
he asked what it meant.

<span id="an_18:37">18:37</span> And they told him, that Jesus of
Nazareth was passing by.

<span id="an_18:38">18:38</span> And he cried, saying, Jesus, thou son
of David, have mercy on me.

<span id="an_18:39">18:39</span> And they who went before rebuked him,
that he should hold his peace: but he cried so much the more, Thou son
of David, have mercy on me.

<span id="an_18:40">18:40</span> And Jesus stood and commanded him to be
brought to him: and when he had come near, he asked him,

<span id="an_18:41">18:41</span> Saying, What wilt thou that I shall do
to thee? And he said, Lord, that I may receive my sight.

<span id="an_18:42">18:42</span> And Jesus said to him, Receive thy
sight: thy faith hath saved thee.

<span id="an_18:43">18:43</span> And immediately he received his sight,
and followed him, glorifying God: and all the people, when they saw it,
gave praise to God.

<span id="an_19:1">19:1</span> And Jesus entered and passed through
Jericho.

<span id="an_19:2">19:2</span> And behold, there was a man named
Zaccheus, who was the chief among the publicans, and he was rich.

<span id="an_19:3">19:3</span> And he sought to see Jesus who he was;
and could not for the crowd, because he was little of stature.

<span id="an_19:4">19:4</span> And he ran before, and climbed up upon a
sycamore-tree to see him; for he was to pass that way.

<span id="an_19:5">19:5</span> And when Jesus came to the place, he
looked up, and saw him, and said to him, Zaccheus, make haste, and come
down: for to-day I must abide at thy house.

<span id="an_19:6">19:6</span> And he made haste, and came down, and
received him joyfully.

<span id="an_19:7">19:7</span> And when they saw it, they all murmured,
saying, That he was gone to be guest with a man that is a sinner.

<span id="an_19:8">19:8</span> And Zaccheus stood, and said to the Lord;
Behold, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor; and if I have
taken any thing from any man by false accusation, I restore him
four-fold.

<span id="an_19:9">19:9</span> And Jesus said to him, This day is
salvation come to this house, forasmuch as he also is a son of Abraham.

<span id="an_19:10">19:10</span> For the Son of man is come to seek and
to save that which was lost.

<span id="an_19:11">19:11</span> And as they heard these things, he
added and spoke a parable, because he was nigh to Jerusalem, and because
they thought that the kingdom of God would immediately appear.

<span id="an_19:12">19:12</span> He said therefore, A certain nobleman
went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom, and to return.

<span id="an_19:13">19:13</span> And he called his ten servants, and
delivered them ten pounds, and said to them, Occupy till I come.

<span id="an_19:14">19:14</span> But his citizens hated him, and sent a
message after him, saying, We will not have this man to reign over us.

<span id="an_19:15">19:15</span> And it came to pass, that when he had
returned, having received the kingdom, then he commanded these servants
to be called to him, to whom he had given the money, that he might know
how much every man had gained by trading.

<span id="an_19:16">19:16</span> Then came the first, saying, Lord, thy
pound hath gained ten pounds.

<span id="an_19:17">19:17</span> And he said to him, Well, thou good
servant: because thou hast been faithful in a very little, have thou
authority over ten cities.

<span id="an_19:18">19:18</span> And the second came, saying, Lord, thy
pound hath gained five pounds.

<span id="an_19:19">19:19</span> And he said likewise to him, Be thou
also over five cities.

<span id="an_19:20">19:20</span> And another came, saying, Lord, behold,
here is thy pound, which I have kept laid up in a napkin:

<span id="an_19:21">19:21</span> For I feared thee, because thou art an
austere man: thou takest up what thou layedst not down, and reapest what
thou didst not sow.

<span id="an_19:22">19:22</span> And he saith to him, Out of thy own
mouth will I judge thee, thou wicked servant. Thou knewest me to be an
austere man, taking up what I laid not down, and reaping what I did not
sow:

<span id="an_19:23">19:23</span> Why then gavest thou not my money into
the bank, that at my coming I might have required my own with interest?

<span id="an_19:24">19:24</span> And he said to them that stood by, Take
from him the pound, and give it to him that hath ten pounds.

<span id="an_19:25">19:25</span> (And they said to him, Lord, he hath
ten pounds.)

<span id="an_19:26">19:26</span> For I say to you, That to every one who
hath shall be given; and from him that hath not, even what he hath shall
be taken away from him.

<span id="an_19:27">19:27</span> But those my enemies, who would not
that I should reign over them, bring hither, and slay them before me.

<span id="an_19:28">19:28</span> And when he had thus spoken, he went
before, ascending towards Jerusalem.

<span id="an_19:29">19:29</span> And it came to pass, when he had come
nigh to Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount called the mount of Olives,
he sent two of his disciples,

<span id="an_19:30">19:30</span> Saying, Go ye into the village over
against you; in which at your entering ye will find a colt tied, on
which yet never man sat: loose him, and bring him hither.

<span id="an_19:31">19:31</span> And if any man shall ask you, Why do ye
loose him? thus shall ye say to him, Because the Lord hath need of him.

<span id="an_19:32">19:32</span> And they that were sent, went and found
even as he had said to them.

<span id="an_19:33">19:33</span> And as they were loosing the colt, the
owners of it said to them, Why loose ye the colt?

<span id="an_19:34">19:34</span> And they said, The Lord hath need of
him.

<span id="an_19:35">19:35</span> And they brought him to Jesus: and they
cast their garments upon the colt, and they set Jesus upon him.

<span id="an_19:36">19:36</span> And as he went, they spread their
clothes in the way.

<span id="an_19:37">19:37</span> And when he had come nigh, even now at
the descent of the mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples
began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice, for all the mighty
works that they had seen.

<span id="an_19:38">19:38</span> Saying, Blessed be the King that cometh
in the name of the Lord: Peace in heaven, and glory in the highest.

<span id="an_19:39">19:39</span> And some of the Pharisees from among
the multitude said to him, Master, rebuke thy disciples.

<span id="an_19:40">19:40</span> And he answered and said to them, I
tell you, that if these should hold their peace, the stones would
immediately cry out.

<span id="an_19:41">19:41</span> And when he had come near, he beheld
the city, and wept over it,

<span id="an_19:42">19:42</span> Saying, If thou hadst known, even thou,
at least in this thy day, the things which belong to thy peace! but now
they are hid from thy eyes.

<span id="an_19:43">19:43</span> For the days shall come upon thee, that
thy enemies shall cast a trench about thee, and encompass thee, and keep
thee in on every side,

<span id="an_19:44">19:44</span> And shall lay thee even with the
ground, and thy children within thee: and they shall not leave in thee
one stone upon another: because thou knewest not the time of thy
visitation.

<span id="an_19:45">19:45</span> And he went into the temple, and began
to cast out them that sold in it, and them that bought,

<span id="an_19:46">19:46</span> Saying to them, It is written, My house
is the house of prayer, but ye have made it a den of thieves.

<span id="an_19:47">19:47</span> And he taught daily in the temple. But
the chief priests, and the scribes, and the chief of the people sought
to destroy him,

<span id="an_19:48">19:48</span> And could not find what they might do:
for all the people were very attentive to hear him.

<span id="an_20:1">20:1</span> And it came to pass, that on one of those
days, as he was teaching the people in the temple, and preaching the
gospel, the chief priests and the scribes came upon him, with the
elders,

<span id="an_20:2">20:2</span> And spoke to him, saying, Tell us, By
what authority doest thou these things? or who is he that gave thee this
authority?

<span id="an_20:3">20:3</span> And he answered and said to them, I will
also ask you one thing; and answer me:

<span id="an_20:4">20:4</span> The baptism of John, was it from heaven,
or from men?

<span id="an_20:5">20:5</span> And they reasoned with themselves,
saying, If we shall say, From heaven; he will say, Why then believed ye
him not?

<span id="an_20:6">20:6</span> But if we say, From men; all the people
will stone us: for they are persuaded that John was a prophet.

<span id="an_20:7">20:7</span> And they answered, that they could not
tell whence it was.

<span id="an_20:8">20:8</span> And Jesus said to them, Neither do I tell
you by what authority I do these things.

<span id="an_20:9">20:9</span> Then he began to speak to the people this
parable; A certain man planted a vineyard, and let it to husbandmen, and
went into a far country for a long time.

<span id="an_20:10">20:10</span> And at the season he sent a servant to
the husbandmen, that they should give him of the fruit of the vineyard:
but the husbandmen beat him, and sent him away empty.

<span id="an_20:11">20:11</span> And again he sent another servant: and
they beat him also, and treated him shamefully, and sent him away empty.

<span id="an_20:12">20:12</span> And again he sent the third: and they
wounded him also, and cast him out.

<span id="an_20:13">20:13</span> Then said the lord of the vineyard,
What shall I do? I will send my beloved son: it may be when they see him
they will reverence him.

<span id="an_20:14">20:14</span> But when the husbandmen saw him, they
reasoned among themselves, saying, This is the heir; come, let us kill
him, that the inheritance may be ours.

<span id="an_20:15">20:15</span> So they cast him out of the vineyard,
and killed him. What therefore will the lord of the vineyard do to them?

<span id="an_20:16">20:16</span> He will come and destroy these
husbandmen, and will give the vineyard to others. And when they heard
it, they said, may that never be.

<span id="an_20:17">20:17</span> And he beheld them, and said, What is
this then that is written, The stone which the builders rejected, the
same is become the head of the corner?

<span id="an_20:18">20:18</span> Whoever shall fall upon that stone,
shall be broken: but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to
powder.

<span id="an_20:19">20:19</span> And the chief priests and the scribes
the same hour sought to lay hands on him; and they feared the people:
for they perceived that he had spoken this parable against them.

<span id="an_20:20">20:20</span> And they watched him, and sent forth
spies, who should feign themselves just men, that they might take hold
of his words, that so they might deliver him to the power and authority
of the governor.

<span id="an_20:21">20:21</span> And they asked him, saying, Master, we
know that thou sayest and teachest rightly, neither acceptest thou the
person of any, but teachest the way of God truly:

<span id="an_20:22">20:22</span> Is it lawful for us to give tribute to
Cesar, or not?

<span id="an_20:23">20:23</span> But he perceived their craftiness, and
said to them, Why tempt ye me?

<span id="an_20:24">20:24</span> Show me a penny. Whose image and
superscription hath it? They answered and said, Cesar's.

<span id="an_20:25">20:25</span> And he said to them, Render therefore
to Cesar the things which are Cesar's, and to God the things which are
God's.

<span id="an_20:26">20:26</span> And they could not take hold of his
words before the people: and they marveled at his answer, and held their
peace.

<span id="an_20:27">20:27</span> Then came to him certain of the
Sadducees (who deny that there is any resurrection) and they asked him,

<span id="an_20:28">20:28</span> Saying, Master, Moses wrote to us, If
any man's brother should die, having a wife, and he should die without
children, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up seed to
his brother.

<span id="an_20:29">20:29</span> There were therefore seven brothers:
and the first took a wife, and died without children.

<span id="an_20:30">20:30</span> And the second took her for a wife, and
he died childless.

<span id="an_20:31">20:31</span> And the third took her; and in like
manner the seven also: And they left no children, and died.

<span id="an_20:32">20:32</span> Last of all the woman died also.

<span id="an_20:33">20:33</span> Therefore in the resurrection, whose
wife of them is she? for seven had her to wife.

<span id="an_20:34">20:34</span> And Jesus answering, said to them, The
children of this world marry, and are given in marriage:

<span id="an_20:35">20:35</span> But they who shall be accounted worthy
to obtain that world, and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry,
nor are given in marriage.

<span id="an_20:36">20:36</span> Neither can they die any more: for they
are equal to the angels; and are the children of God, being the children
of the resurrection.

<span id="an_20:37">20:37</span> Now that the dead are raised, even
Moses showed at the bush, when he calleth the Lord the God of Abraham,
and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.

<span id="an_20:38">20:38</span> For he is not a God of the dead, but of
the living: for all live to him.

<span id="an_20:39">20:39</span> Then certain of the scribes answering,
said, Master, thou hast well said.

<span id="an_20:40">20:40</span> And after that, they durst not ask him
any question at all.

<span id="an_20:41">20:41</span> And he said to them, How say they that
Christ is David's son?

<span id="an_20:42">20:42</span> And David himself saith in the book of
Psalms, The LORD said to my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand,

<span id="an_20:43">20:43</span> Till I make thy enemies thy footstool.

<span id="an_20:44">20:44</span> David therefore calleth him Lord, how
is he then his son?

<span id="an_20:45">20:45</span> Then in the audience of all the people,
he said to his disciples,

<span id="an_20:46">20:46</span> Beware of the scribes, who desire to
walk in long robes, and love greetings in the markets, and the highest
seats in the synagogues, and the chief rooms at feasts;

<span id="an_20:47">20:47</span> Who devour widows' houses, and for a
show make long prayers: the same shall receive greater damnation.

<span id="an_21:1">21:1</span> And he looked up, and saw rich men
casting their gifts into the treasury.

<span id="an_21:2">21:2</span> And he saw also a certain poor widow,
casting in thither two mites.

<span id="an_21:3">21:3</span> And he said, Of a truth I say to you,
that this poor widow hath cast in more than they all.

<span id="an_21:4">21:4</span> For all these have of their abundance
cast in to the offerings of God: but she of her penury hath cast in all
the living that she had.

<span id="an_21:5">21:5</span> And as some spoke of the temple, that it
was adorned with goodly stones, and gifts, he said,

<span id="an_21:6">21:6</span> As for these things which ye behold, the
days will come, in which there shall not be left one stone upon another,
that will not be thrown down.

<span id="an_21:7">21:7</span> And they asked him, saying, Master, but
when will these things be? and what sign will there be when these things
shall come to pass?

<span id="an_21:8">21:8</span> And he said, Take heed that ye be not
deceived: for many will come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and the
time draweth near: therefore go ye not after them.

<span id="an_21:9">21:9</span> But when ye shall hear of wars, and
commotions, be not terrified: for these things must first come to pass:
but the end is not immediately.

<span id="an_21:10">21:10</span> Then said he to them, Nation will rise
against nation, and kingdom against kingdom:

<span id="an_21:11">21:11</span> And great earthquakes will be in divers
places, and famines, and pestilences: and fearful sights, and great
signs will there be from heaven.

<span id="an_21:12">21:12</span> But before all these they will lay
their hands on you, and persecute you, delivering you up to the
synagogues, and into prisons, being brought before kings and rulers for
my name's sake.

<span id="an_21:13">21:13</span> And it shall turn to you for a
testimony.

<span id="an_21:14">21:14</span> Settle it therefore in your hearts, not
to meditate before what ye shall answer.

<span id="an_21:15">21:15</span> For I will give you a mouth and wisdom,
which all your adversaries shall not be able to gainsay nor resist.

<span id="an_21:16">21:16</span> And ye will be betrayed both by
parents, and brethren, and kinsmen, and friends; and some of you will
they cause to be put to death.

<span id="an_21:17">21:17</span> And ye will be hated by all men for my
name's sake.

<span id="an_21:18">21:18</span> But there shall not a hair of your head
perish.

<span id="an_21:19">21:19</span> In your patience possess ye your souls.

<span id="an_21:20">21:20</span> And when ye shall see Jerusalem
compassed with armies, then know that its desolation is nigh.

<span id="an_21:21">21:21</span> Then let them who are in Judea flee to
the mountains; and let them who are in the midst of it depart from it;
and let not them that are in the countries enter into it.

<span id="an_21:22">21:22</span> For these are the days of vengeance,
that all things which are written may be fulfilled.

<span id="an_21:23">21:23</span> But woe to them that are with child,
and to them that nurse infants in those days! for there shall be great
distress in the land, and wrath upon this people.

<span id="an_21:24">21:24</span> And they shall fall by the edge of the
sword, and shall be led away captive into all nations: and Jerusalem
shall be trodden down by the Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles
shall be fulfilled.

<span id="an_21:25">21:25</span> And there shall be signs in the sun,
and in the moon, and in the stars; and upon the earth distress of
nations, with perplexity; the sea and the waves roaring;

<span id="an_21:26">21:26</span> Men's hearts failing them for fear, and
for apprehension of those things which are coming on the earth: for the
powers of heaven shall be shaken.

<span id="an_21:27">21:27</span> And then shall they see the Son of man
coming in a cloud, with power and great glory.

<span id="an_21:28">21:28</span> And when these things begin to come to
pass, then look up, and lift up your heads: for your redemption draweth
nigh.

<span id="an_21:29">21:29</span> And he spoke to them a parable; Behold
the fig-tree, and all the trees;

<span id="an_21:30">21:30</span> When they now shoot forth, ye see and
know of your ownselves that summer is now nigh at hand.

<span id="an_21:31">21:31</span> So likewise ye, when ye see these
things come to pass, know that the kingdom of God is nigh at hand.

<span id="an_21:32">21:32</span> Verily I say to you, This generation
shall not pass away, till all be fulfilled.

<span id="an_21:33">21:33</span> Heaven and earth shall pass away: but
my word shall not pass away.

<span id="an_21:34">21:34</span> And take heed to yourselves, lest at
any time your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting and drunkenness, and
cares of this life, and so that day come upon you unawares.

<span id="an_21:35">21:35</span> For as a snare shall it come on all
them that dwell on the face of the whole earth.

<span id="an_21:36">21:36</span> Watch ye therefore, and pray always,
that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall
come to pass, and to stand before the Son of man.

<span id="an_21:37">21:37</span> And in the day-time he was teaching in
the temple; and at night he went out, and abode in the mount that is
called the mount of Olives.

<span id="an_21:38">21:38</span> And all the people came early in the
morning to him in the temple, to hear him.

<span id="an_22:1">22:1</span> Now the feast of unleavened bread drew
nigh, which is called the Passover.

<span id="an_22:2">22:2</span> And the chief priests and scribes sought
how they might kill him: for they feared the people.

<span id="an_22:3">22:3</span> Then Satan entered into Judas surnamed
Iscariot, being of the number of the twelve.

<span id="an_22:4">22:4</span> And he went, and communed with the chief
priests and captains, how he might betray him to them.

<span id="an_22:5">22:5</span> And they were glad, and covenanted to
give him money.

<span id="an_22:6">22:6</span> And he promised, and sought opportunity
to betray him to them in the absence of the multitude.

<span id="an_22:7">22:7</span> Then came the day of unleavened bread,
when the passover must be killed.

<span id="an_22:8">22:8</span> And he sent Peter and John, saying, Go
and prepare for us the passover, that we may eat.

<span id="an_22:9">22:9</span> And they said to him, Where wilt thou
that we prepare?

<span id="an_22:10">22:10</span> And he said to them, Behold, when ye
have entered into the city, there shall a man meet you, bearing a
pitcher of water; follow him into the house where he entereth.

<span id="an_22:11">22:11</span> And ye shall say to the master of the
house, The Master saith to thee, Where is the guest-chamber, where I may
eat the passover with my disciples?

<span id="an_22:12">22:12</span> And he will show you a large upper room
furnished: there make ready.

<span id="an_22:13">22:13</span> And they went and found as he had said
to them: and they made ready the passover.

<span id="an_22:14">22:14</span> And when the hour was come, he sat
down, and the twelve apostles with him.

<span id="an_22:15">22:15</span> And he said to them, I have earnestly
desired to eat this passover with you before I suffer.

<span id="an_22:16">22:16</span> For I say to you, I will not any more
eat of it until it shall be fulfilled in the kingdom of God.

<span id="an_22:17">22:17</span> And he took the cup, and gave thanks,
and said, Take this, and divide it among yourselves.

<span id="an_22:18">22:18</span> For I say to you, I will not drink of
the fruit of the vine, until the kingdom of God shall come.

<span id="an_22:19">22:19</span> And he took bread, and gave thanks, and
broke it, and gave to them, saying, This is my body which is given for
you: this do in remembrance of me.

<span id="an_22:20">22:20</span> Likewise also the cup after supper,
saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood, which is shed for
you.

<span id="an_22:21">22:21</span> But behold, the hand of him that
betrayeth me is with me on the table.

<span id="an_22:22">22:22</span> And truly the Son of man goeth as it
was determined: but woe to that man by whom he is betrayed!

<span id="an_22:23">22:23</span> And they began to inquire among
themselves, which of them it was that should do this thing.

<span id="an_22:24">22:24</span> And there was also a strife among them,
which of them should be accounted the greatest.

<span id="an_22:25">22:25</span> And he said to them, The kings of the
Gentiles exercise lordship over them; and they that exercise authority
upon them, are called benefactors.

<span id="an_22:26">22:26</span> But ye shall not be so: but he that is
greatest among you, let him be as the younger; and he that is chief, as
he that doth serve.

<span id="an_22:27">22:27</span> For which is greater, he that sitteth
at table, or he that serveth? is not he that sitteth at table? but I am
among you as he that serveth.

<span id="an_22:28">22:28</span> Ye are they who have continued with me
in my temptations.

<span id="an_22:29">22:29</span> And I appoint to you a kingdom, as my
Father hath appointed to me;

<span id="an_22:30">22:30</span> That ye may eat and drink at my table
in my kingdom, and sit on thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.

<span id="an_22:31">22:31</span> And the Lord said, Simon, Simon,
behold, Satan hath desired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat:

<span id="an_22:32">22:32</span> But I have prayed for thee, that thy
faith fail not; and when thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren.

<span id="an_22:33">22:33</span> And he said to him, Lord, I am ready to
go with thee both into prison, and to death.

<span id="an_22:34">22:34</span> And he said, I tell thee, Peter, the
cock will not crow this day, before thou wilt thrice deny that thou
knowest me.

<span id="an_22:35">22:35</span> And he said to them, When I sent you
without purse, and sack, and shoes, lacked ye any thing? And they said,
Nothing.

<span id="an_22:36">22:36</span> Then said he to them, But now he that
hath a purse, let him take it, and likewise his sack: and he that hath
no sword, let him sell his garment, and buy one.

<span id="an_22:37">22:37</span> For I say to you, that this which is
written must yet be accomplished in me, And he was reckoned among the
transgressors: for the things concerning me have an end.

<span id="an_22:38">22:38</span> And they said, Lord, behold, here are
two swords. And he said to them, It is enough.

<span id="an_22:39">22:39</span> And he came out, and went, as he was
wont, to the mount of Olives; and his disciples also followed him.

<span id="an_22:40">22:40</span> And when he was at the place, he said
to them, Pray, that ye enter not into temptation.

<span id="an_22:41">22:41</span> And he was withdrawn from them about a
stone's cast, and kneeled down, and prayed.

<span id="an_22:42">22:42</span> Saying, Father, if thou art willing,
remove this cup from me: nevertheless not my will, but thine be done.

<span id="an_22:43">22:43</span> And there appeared to him an angel from
heaven, strengthening him.

<span id="an_22:44">22:44</span> And being in an agony, he prayed more
earnestly: and his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling to
the ground.

<span id="an_22:45">22:45</span> And when he arose from prayer, and had
come to his disciples, he found them sleeping for sorrow:

<span id="an_22:46">22:46</span> And said to them, Why sleep ye? rise
and pray, lest ye enter into temptation.

<span id="an_22:47">22:47</span> And while he was yet speaking, behold a
multitude, and he that was called Judas, one of the twelve, went before
them, and drew near to Jesus to kiss him.

<span id="an_22:48">22:48</span> But Jesus said to him, Judas, betrayest
thou the Son of man with a kiss?

<span id="an_22:49">22:49</span> When they who were about him, saw what
would follow, they said to him, Lord, shall we smite with the sword?

<span id="an_22:50">22:50</span> And one of them smote the servant of
the high priest, and cut off his right ear.

<span id="an_22:51">22:51</span> And Jesus answered and said, Suffer ye
thus far. And he touched his ear, and healed him.

<span id="an_22:52">22:52</span> Then Jesus said to the chief priests,
and captains of the temple, and the elders who had come to him, Are ye
come out as against a thief, with swords and staffs?

<span id="an_22:53">22:53</span> When I was daily with you in the
temple, ye stretched forth no hands against me: but this is your hour,
and the power of darkness.

<span id="an_22:54">22:54</span> Then they took him, and led him, and
brought him into the high priest's house. And Peter followed at a
distance.

<span id="an_22:55">22:55</span> And when they had kindled a fire in the
midst of the hall, and were set down together, Peter sat down among
them.

<span id="an_22:56">22:56</span> But a certain maid beheld him as he sat
by the fire, and earnestly looked upon him, and said, This man was also
with him.

<span id="an_22:57">22:57</span> And he denied him, saying, Woman, I
know him not.

<span id="an_22:58">22:58</span> And after a little while another saw
him, and said, Thou art also of them. And Peter said, Man, I am not.

<span id="an_22:59">22:59</span> And about the space of one hour after,
another confidently affirmed, saying, In truth this man also was with
him; for he is a Galilean.

<span id="an_22:60">22:60</span> And Peter said, Man, I know not what
thou sayest. And immediately, while he was yet speaking, the cock
crowed.

<span id="an_22:61">22:61</span> And the Lord turned, and looked upon
Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how he had said to
him, Before the cock shall crow, thou wilt deny me thrice.

<span id="an_22:62">22:62</span> And Peter went out, and wept bitterly.

<span id="an_22:63">22:63</span> And the men that held Jesus, mocked
him, and smote him.

<span id="an_22:64">22:64</span> And when they had blindfolded him, they
struck him on the face, and asked him, saying, Prophesy, who is it that
smote thee?

<span id="an_22:65">22:65</span> And many other things blasphemously
they spoke against him.

<span id="an_22:66">22:66</span> And as soon as it was day, the elders
of the people, and the chief priests, and the scribes came together, and
led him into their council,

<span id="an_22:67">22:67</span> Saying, Art thou the Christ? tell us.
And he said to them, If I tell you, ye will not believe.

<span id="an_22:68">22:68</span> And if I also ask you, ye will not
answer me, nor let me go.

<span id="an_22:69">22:69</span> Hereafter will the Son of man sit on
the right hand of the power of God.

<span id="an_22:70">22:70</span> Then said they all, Art thou then the
Son of God? And he said to them, Ye say that I am.

<span id="an_22:71">22:71</span> And they said, What need have we of any
further testimony? for we ourselves have heard from his own mouth.

<span id="an_23:1">23:1</span> And the whole multitude of them arose,
and led him to Pilate.

<span id="an_23:2">23:2</span> And they began to accuse him, saying, We
found this man perverting the nation, and forbidding to give tribute to
Cesar, saying, that he himself is Christ a king.

<span id="an_23:3">23:3</span> And Pilate asked him, saying, Art thou
the King of the Jews? And he answered him and said, Thou sayest it.

<span id="an_23:4">23:4</span> Then said Pilate to the chief priests,
and to the people, I find no fault in this man.

<span id="an_23:5">23:5</span> And they were the more fierce, saying, He
stirreth up the people, teaching throughout all Judea, beginning from
Galilee to this place.

<span id="an_23:6">23:6</span> When Pilate heard of Galilee, he asked
whether the man was a Galilean.

<span id="an_23:7">23:7</span> And as soon as he knew that he belonged
to Herod's jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who himself was also at
Jerusalem at that time.

<span id="an_23:8">23:8</span> And when Herod saw Jesus, he was
exceeding glad: for he had been for a long time, desirous to see him,
because he had heard many things of him; and he hoped to see some
miracle done by him.

<span id="an_23:9">23:9</span> Then he questioned with him in many
words; but he answered him nothing.

<span id="an_23:10">23:10</span> And the chief priests and scribes stood
and vehemently accused him.

<span id="an_23:11">23:11</span> And Herod with his troops set him at
naught, and mocked him, and arrayed him in a gorgeous robe, and sent him
again to Pilate.

<span id="an_23:12">23:12</span> And the same day Pilate and Herod were
made friends together; for before they were at enmity between
themselves.

<span id="an_23:13">23:13</span> And Pilate, when he had called together
the chief priests, and the rulers, and the people,

<span id="an_23:14">23:14</span> Said to them, Ye have brought this man
to me, as one that perverteth the people: and behold, I, having examined
him before you, have found no fault in this man, touching those things
of which ye accuse him;

<span id="an_23:15">23:15</span> No, nor yet Herod: for I sent you to
him; and lo, nothing worthy of death is done to him:

<span id="an_23:16">23:16</span> I will therefore chastise him, and
release him.

<span id="an_23:17">23:17</span> (For of necessity he must release one
to them at the feast.)

<span id="an_23:18">23:18</span> And they cried out all at once, saying,
Away with this man, and release to us Barabbas:

<span id="an_23:19">23:19</span> (Who, for a certain sedition made in
the city, and for murder, was cast into prison.)

<span id="an_23:20">23:20</span> Pilate therefore, willing to release
Jesus, spoke again to them.

<span id="an_23:21">23:21</span> But they cried, saying, Crucify,
crucify him.

<span id="an_23:22">23:22</span> And he said to them the third time,
Why, what evil hath he done? I have found no cause of death in him; I
will therefore chastise him, and let him go.

<span id="an_23:23">23:23</span> And they were urgent with loud voices,
requiring that he might be crucified: and the voices of them, and of the
chief priests prevailed.

<span id="an_23:24">23:24</span> And Pilate gave sentence that it should
be as they required.

<span id="an_23:25">23:25</span> And he released to them him that for
sedition and murder had been cast into prison, whom they had desired;
but he delivered Jesus to their will.

<span id="an_23:26">23:26</span> And as they led him away, they laid
hold upon one Simon a Cyrenian, coming out of the country, and on him
they laid the cross, that he might bear it after Jesus.

<span id="an_23:27">23:27</span> And there followed him a great company
of people, and of women, who also bewailed and lamented him.

<span id="an_23:28">23:28</span> But Jesus turning to them, said,
Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but weep for yourselves, and
for your children.

<span id="an_23:29">23:29</span> For behold, the days are coming, in
which they shall say, Blessed are the barren, and the wombs that never
bore, and the breasts which never nourished infants.

<span id="an_23:30">23:30</span> Then shall they begin to say to the
mountains, Fall on us; and to the hills, Cover us.

<span id="an_23:31">23:31</span> For if they do these things in a green
tree, what will be done in the dry?

<span id="an_23:32">23:32</span> And two others, who were malefactors,
were led with him to be put to death.

<span id="an_23:33">23:33</span> And when they had come to the place
which is called Calvary, there they crucified him, and the malefactors;
one on the right hand, and the other on the left.

<span id="an_23:34">23:34</span> Then said Jesus, Father, forgive them:
for they know not what they do. And they parted his raiment, and cast
lots.

<span id="an_23:35">23:35</span> And the people stood beholding. And the
rulers also with them derided him, saying, He saved others; let him save
himself, if he is Christ the chosen of God.

<span id="an_23:36">23:36</span> And the soldiers also mocked him,
coming to him, and offering him vinegar,

<span id="an_23:37">23:37</span> And saying, If thou art the King of the
Jews, save thyself.

<span id="an_23:38">23:38</span> And a superscription also was written
over him, in letters of Greek, and Latin, and Hebrew, THIS IS THE KING
OF THE JEWS.

<span id="an_23:39">23:39</span> And one of the malefactors, who were
hanged, railed on him, saying, If thou art Christ, save thyself and us.

<span id="an_23:40">23:40</span> But the other answering, rebuked him,
saying, Dost not thou fear God, seeing thou art in the same
condemnation?

<span id="an_23:41">23:41</span> And we indeed justly; for we receive
the due reward of our deeds: but this man hath done nothing amiss.

<span id="an_23:42">23:42</span> And he said to Jesus, Lord, remember me
when thou comest into thy kingdom.

<span id="an_23:43">23:43</span> And Jesus said to him, Verily I say to
thee, This day shalt thou be with me in paradise.

<span id="an_23:44">23:44</span> And it was about the sixth hour, and
there was a darkness over all the land until the ninth hour.

<span id="an_23:45">23:45</span> And the sun was darkened, and the vail
of the temple was rent in the midst.

<span id="an_23:46">23:46</span> And when Jesus had cried with a loud
voice, he said, Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit: and having
said thus, he expired.

<span id="an_23:47">23:47</span> Now when the centurion saw what was
done, he glorified God, saying, Certainly this was a righteous man.

<span id="an_23:48">23:48</span> And all the people that came together
to that sight, beholding the things which were done, smote their
breasts, and returned.

<span id="an_23:49">23:49</span> And all his acquaintance, and the women
that followed him from Galilee, stood afar off beholding these things.

<span id="an_23:50">23:50</span> And behold, there was a man named
Joseph, a counselor: and he was a good man, and a just:

<span id="an_23:51">23:51</span> (The same had not consented to the
counsel and deed of them) he was of Arimathea, a city of the Jews; who
also himself waited for the kingdom of God.

<span id="an_23:52">23:52</span> This man went to Pilate, and begged the
body of Jesus.

<span id="an_23:53">23:53</span> And he took it down, and wrapped it in
linen, and laid it in a sepulcher that was hewn in stone, in which man
was never before laid.

<span id="an_23:54">23:54</span> And that day was the preparation, and
the sabbath drew on.

<span id="an_23:55">23:55</span> And the women also, who came with him
from Galilee, followed after, and beheld the sepulcher, and how his body
was laid.

<span id="an_23:56">23:56</span> And they returned, and prepared spices
and ointments; and rested on the sabbath, according to the commandment.

<span id="an_24:1">24:1</span> Now upon the first day of the week, very
early in the morning, they came to the sepulcher, bringing the spices
which they had prepared, and certain others with them.

<span id="an_24:2">24:2</span> And they found the stone rolled away from
the sepulcher.

<span id="an_24:3">24:3</span> And they entered in, and found not the
body of the Lord Jesus.

<span id="an_24:4">24:4</span> And it came to pass, as they were much
perplexed at this, behold, two men stood by them in shining garments.

<span id="an_24:5">24:5</span> And as they were afraid, and bowed down
their faces to the earth, they said to them, Why seek ye the living
among the dead?

<span id="an_24:6">24:6</span> He is not here, but is risen. Remember
how he spoke to you when he was yet in Galilee,

<span id="an_24:7">24:7</span> Saying, The Son of man must be delivered
into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise
again.

<span id="an_24:8">24:8</span> And they remembered his words,

<span id="an_24:9">24:9</span> And returned from the sepulcher, and told
all these things to the eleven, and to all the rest.

<span id="an_24:10">24:10</span> It was Mary Magdalene, and Joanna, and
Mary the mother of James, and other women that were with them, who told
these things to the apostles.

<span id="an_24:11">24:11</span> And their words seemed to them as idle
tales, and they believed them not.

<span id="an_24:12">24:12</span> Then Peter arose, and ran to the
sepulcher, and stooping down, he beheld the linen clothes laid by
themselves, and departed, wondering in himself at that which had come to
pass.

<span id="an_24:13">24:13</span> And behold, two of them went that same
day to a village called Emmaus, which was from Jerusalem about sixty
furlongs.

<span id="an_24:14">24:14</span> And they talked together of all these
things which had happened.

<span id="an_24:15">24:15</span> And it came to pass, that, while they
communed together, and reasoned, Jesus himself drew near, and went with
them.

<span id="an_24:16">24:16</span> But their eyes were held, that they
should not know him.

<span id="an_24:17">24:17</span> And he said to them, What manner of
communications are these that ye have one to another, as ye walk, and
are sad?

<span id="an_24:18">24:18</span> And one of them, whose name was
Cleopas, answering, said to him, Art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem,
and hast not known the things which have come to pass there in these
days?

<span id="an_24:19">24:19</span> And he said to them, What things? And
they said to him, Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, who was a prophet mighty
in deed and word before God, and all the people:

<span id="an_24:20">24:20</span> And how the chief priests and our
rulers delivered him to be condemned to death, and crucified him.

<span id="an_24:21">24:21</span> But we trusted that it had been he who
would have redeemed Israel: and besides all this, to-day is the third
day since these things were done.

<span id="an_24:22">24:22</span> Yes, and certain women also of our
company made us astonished, who were early at the sepulcher.

<span id="an_24:23">24:23</span> And when they found not his body, they
came, saying, that they had also seen a vision of angels, who said that
he was alive.

<span id="an_24:24">24:24</span> And certain of them who were with us,
went to the sepulcher, and found it even so as the women had said: but
him they saw not.

<span id="an_24:25">24:25</span> Then he said to them, O fools, and slow
of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken!

<span id="an_24:26">24:26</span> Ought not Christ to suffer these
things, and to enter into his glory?

<span id="an_24:27">24:27</span> And beginning at Moses, and all the
prophets, he expounded to them in all the scriptures the things
concerning himself.

<span id="an_24:28">24:28</span> And they drew nigh to the village
whither they were going: and he made as though he would go further.

<span id="an_24:29">24:29</span> But they constrained him, saying, Abide
with us: for it is towards evening, and the day is far spent. And he
went in to tarry with them.

<span id="an_24:30">24:30</span> And it came to pass, as he sat at table
with them, he took bread, and blessed it, and broke, and gave to them.

<span id="an_24:31">24:31</span> And their eyes were opened, and they
knew him: and he vanished out of their sight.

<span id="an_24:32">24:32</span> And they said one to another, Did not
our heart burn within us while he talked with us by the way, and while
he opened to us the scriptures?

<span id="an_24:33">24:33</span> And they rose the same hour, and
returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven assembled, and them that
were with them,

<span id="an_24:34">24:34</span> Saying, The Lord is risen indeed, and
hath appeared to Simon.

<span id="an_24:35">24:35</span> And they told what things were done in
the way, and how he was known to them in breaking of bread.

<span id="an_24:36">24:36</span> And as they were thus speaking, Jesus
himself stood in the midst of them, and saith to them, Peace be to you.

<span id="an_24:37">24:37</span> But they were terrified and affrighted,
and supposed that they had seen a spirit.

<span id="an_24:38">24:38</span> And he said to them, Why are ye
troubled? and why do thoughts arise in your hearts?

<span id="an_24:39">24:39</span> Behold my hands and my feet, that it is
I myself: handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as
ye see me have.

<span id="an_24:40">24:40</span> And when he had thus spoken, he showed
them his hands and his feet.

<span id="an_24:41">24:41</span> And while they yet believed not for
joy, and wondered, he said to them, Have ye here any thing for food?

<span id="an_24:42">24:42</span> And they gave him a piece of a broiled
fish, and a honey-comb.

<span id="an_24:43">24:43</span> And he took it, and ate before them.

<span id="an_24:44">24:44</span> And he said to them, These are the
words which I spoke to you, while I was yet with you, that all things
must be fulfilled, which were written in the law of Moses, and in the
prophets, and in the psalms, concerning me.

<span id="an_24:45">24:45</span> Then he opened their understanding,
that they might understand the scriptures,

<span id="an_24:46">24:46</span> And said to them, Thus it is written,
and thus it behooved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the
third day:

<span id="an_24:47">24:47</span> And that repentance and remission of
sins should be preached in his name among all nations, beginning at
Jerusalem.

<span id="an_24:48">24:48</span> And ye are witnesses of these things.

<span id="an_24:49">24:49</span> And behold, I send the promise of my
Father upon you: but tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem, until ye are
endued with power from on high.

<span id="an_24:50">24:50</span> And he led them out as far as to
Bethany: and he lifted up his hands, and blessed them.

<span id="an_24:51">24:51</span> And it came to pass, while he was
blessing them, he was parted from them, and carried up into heaven.

<span id="an_24:52">24:52</span> And they worshiped him, and returned to
Jerusalem with great joy:

<span id="an_24:53">24:53</span> And were continually in the temple,
praising and blessing God. Amen.
