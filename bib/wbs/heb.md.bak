### Webster's Bible: Hebrews

<span id="an_1:1">1:1</span> God, who at sundry times and in divers
manners spoke in time past to the fathers by the prophets,

<span id="an_1:2">1:2</span> Hath in these last days spoken to us by his
Son, whom he hath appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the
worlds;

<span id="an_1:3">1:3</span> Who being the brightness of his glory, and
the express image of his person, and upholding all things by the word of
his power, when he had by himself made purification of our sins, sat
down on the right hand of the Majesty on high;

<span id="an_1:4">1:4</span> Being made so much better than the angels,
as he hath by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they.

<span id="an_1:5">1:5</span> For to which of the angels said he at any
time, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee? And again, I will
be to him a Father, and he shall be to me a Son?

<span id="an_1:6">1:6</span> And again, when he bringeth in the
first-begotten into the world, he saith, And let all the angels of God
worship him.

<span id="an_1:7">1:7</span> And of the angels he saith, Who maketh his
angels spirits, and his ministers a flame of fire.

<span id="an_1:8">1:8</span> But to the Son, he saith, Thy throne, O
God, is for ever and ever: a scepter of righteousness is the scepter of
thy kingdom.

<span id="an_1:9">1:9</span> Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated
iniquity; therefore God, even thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil
of gladness above thy fellows.

<span id="an_1:10">1:10</span> And, Thou, Lord, in the beginning hast
laid the foundation of the earth: and the heavens are the works of thy
hands.

<span id="an_1:11">1:11</span> They shall perish; but thou remainest:
and they all shall become old as doth a garment;

<span id="an_1:12">1:12</span> And as a vesture wilt thou fold them up,
and they shall be changed; but thou art the same, and thy years shall
not fail.

<span id="an_1:13">1:13</span> But to which of the angels said he at any
time, Sit on my right hand, until I make thy enemies thy footstool?

<span id="an_1:14">1:14</span> Are they not all ministering spirits,
sent forth to minister for them who shall inherit salvation?

<span id="an_2:1">2:1</span> Therefore we ought to give the more earnest
heed to the things which we have heard, lest at any time we should let
them slip.

<span id="an_2:2">2:2</span> For if the word spoken by angels was
steadfast, and every transgression and disobedience received a just
recompense of reward;

<span id="an_2:3">2:3</span> How shall we escape, if we neglect so great
salvation; which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was
confirmed to us by them that heard him;

<span id="an_2:4">2:4</span> God also bearing them testimony, both with
signs and wonders, and with divers miracles, and gifts of the Holy
Spirit, according to his own will?

<span id="an_2:5">2:5</span> For to the angels he hath not put in
subjection the world to come, concerning which we speak.

<span id="an_2:6">2:6</span> But one in a certain place testified,
saying, What is man, that thou art mindful of him? or the son of man,
that thou visitest him?

<span id="an_2:7">2:7</span> Thou madest him a little lower than the
angels; thou crownedst him with glory and honor, and didst set him over
the works of thy hands:

<span id="an_2:8">2:8</span> Thou hast put all things in subjection
under his feet. For in that he put all in subjection under him, he left
nothing that is not made subject to him. But now we see not yet all
things subjected to him.

<span id="an_2:9">2:9</span> But we see Jesus, who was made a little
lower than the angels for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and
honor; that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man.

<span id="an_2:10">2:10</span> For it became him, for whom are all
things, and by whom are all things, in bringing many sons to glory, to
make the Captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings.

<span id="an_2:11">2:11</span> For both he that sanctifieth, and they
who are sanctified, are all of one: for which cause he is not ashamed to
call them brethren,

<span id="an_2:12">2:12</span> Saying, I will declare thy name to my
brethren, in the midst of the church will I sing praise to thee.

<span id="an_2:13">2:13</span> And again, I will put my trust in him.
And again, Behold, I, and the children which God hath given me.

<span id="an_2:14">2:14</span> Since then the children are partakers of
flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same; that
through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is,
the devil;

<span id="an_2:15">2:15</span> And deliver them, who, through fear of
death, were all their life-time subject to bondage.

<span id="an_2:16">2:16</span> For verily he took not on him the nature
of angels; but he took on him the seed of Abraham.

<span id="an_2:17">2:17</span> Wherefore in all things it behooved him
to be made like his brethren; that he might be a merciful and faithful
High Priest in things pertaining to God, to make reconciliation for the
sins of the people.

<span id="an_2:18">2:18</span> For in that he himself hath suffered,
being tempted, he is able to succor them that are tempted.

<span id="an_3:1">3:1</span> Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of the
heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our
profession, Christ Jesus;

<span id="an_3:2">3:2</span> Who was faithful to him that appointed him,
as also Moses was faithful in all his house.

<span id="an_3:3">3:3</span> For this man was counted worthy of more
glory than Moses, inasmuch as he who hath built the house, hath more
honor than the house.

<span id="an_3:4">3:4</span> For every house is built by some man; but
he that built all things is God.

<span id="an_3:5">3:5</span> And Moses verily was faithful in all his
house, as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were
afterwards to be spoken.

<span id="an_3:6">3:6</span> But Christ as a son over his own house:
whose house are we, if we hold fast the confidence, and the rejoicing of
the hope firm to the end.

<span id="an_3:7">3:7</span> Wherefore (as the Holy Spirit saith, To-day
if ye will hear his voice,

<span id="an_3:8">3:8</span> Harden not your hearts, as in the
provocation, in the day of temptation in the wilderness:

<span id="an_3:9">3:9</span> When your fathers tempted me, proved me,
and saw my works forty years.

<span id="an_3:10">3:10</span> Wherefore I was grieved with that
generation, and said, They do always err in their heart; and they have
not known my ways.

<span id="an_3:11">3:11</span> So I swore in my wrath, They shall not
enter into my rest.)

<span id="an_3:12">3:12</span> Take heed, brethren, lest there be in any
of you an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the living God.

<span id="an_3:13">3:13</span> But exhort one another daily, while it is
called To-day; lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of
sin.

<span id="an_3:14">3:14</span> For we are made partakers of Christ, if
we hold the beginning of our confidence steadfast to the end;

<span id="an_3:15">3:15</span> While it is said, To-day if ye will hear
his voice, harden not your hearts, as in the provocation.

<span id="an_3:16">3:16</span> For some, when they had heard, did
provoke: yet, not all that came out of Egypt by Moses.

<span id="an_3:17">3:17</span> But with whom was he grieved forty years?
was it not with them that had sinned, whose carcasses fell in the
wilderness?

<span id="an_3:18">3:18</span> And to whom did he swear that they should
not enter into his rest, but to them that believed not?

<span id="an_3:19">3:19</span> So we see that they could not enter in
because of unbelief.

<span id="an_4:1">4:1</span> Let us therefore fear, lest a promise being
left us of entering into his rest, any of you should seem to come short
of it.

<span id="an_4:2">4:2</span> For to us was the gospel preached, as well
as to them: but the word which they heard did not profit them, not being
mixed with faith in them that heard it.

<span id="an_4:3">4:3</span> For we who have believed do enter into
rest, as he said, As I have sworn in my wrath, if they shall enter into
my rest: although the works were finished from the foundation of the
world.

<span id="an_4:4">4:4</span> For he spoke in a certain place of the
seventh day on this wise, And God rested the seventh day from all his
works.

<span id="an_4:5">4:5</span> And in this place again, If they shall
enter into my rest.

<span id="an_4:6">4:6</span> Seeing therefore it remaineth that some
must enter into it, and they to whom it was first preached entered not
because of unbelief:

<span id="an_4:7">4:7</span> (Again, he limiteth a certain day, saying
in David, To-day, after so long a time; as it is said, To-day, if ye
will hear his voice, harden not your hearts.

<span id="an_4:8">4:8</span> For if Jesus had given them rest, then he
would not afterward have spoken of another day.

<span id="an_4:9">4:9</span> There remaineth therefore a rest to the
people of God.

<span id="an_4:10">4:10</span> For he that hath entered into his rest,
he also hath ceased from his own works, as God did from his.)

<span id="an_4:11">4:11</span> Let us labor therefore to enter into that
rest, lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief.

<span id="an_4:12">4:12</span> For the word of God is living, and
powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the
dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and
is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.

<span id="an_4:13">4:13</span> Neither is there any creature that is not
manifest in his sight: but all things are naked and opened to the eyes
of him with whom we have to do.

<span id="an_4:14">4:14</span> Seeing then that we have a great High
Priest, that hath passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us
hold fast our profession.

<span id="an_4:15">4:15</span> For we have not a high priest who cannot
be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but who was in all
points tempted as we are, yet without sin.

<span id="an_4:16">4:16</span> Let us therefore come boldly to the
throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in
time of need.

<span id="an_5:1">5:1</span> For every high priest taken from among men,
is ordained for men in things pertaining to God, that he may offer both
gifts and sacrifices for sins:

<span id="an_5:2">5:2</span> Who can have compassion on the ignorant,
and on them that are out of the way; for that he himself also is
compassed with infirmity.

<span id="an_5:3">5:3</span> And by reason of this he ought, as for the
people, so also for himself, to offer for sins.

<span id="an_5:4">5:4</span> And no man taketh this honor to himself,
but he that is called by God, as was Aaron:

<span id="an_5:5">5:5</span> So also Christ glorified not himself to be
made a high priest; but he that said to him, Thou art my Son, to-day
have I begotten thee.

<span id="an_5:6">5:6</span> As he saith also in another place, Thou art
a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.

<span id="an_5:7">5:7</span> Who in the days of his flesh, when he had
offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears to him
that was able to save him from death, and was heard, in that he feared;

<span id="an_5:8">5:8</span> Though he was a Son, yet he learned
obedience by the things which he suffered;

<span id="an_5:9">5:9</span> And being made perfect, he became the
author of eternal salvation to all them that obey him;

<span id="an_5:10">5:10</span> Called by God a high priest after the
order of Melchisedec.

<span id="an_5:11">5:11</span> Of whom we have many things to say, and
hard to be uttered, seeing ye are dull of hearing.

<span id="an_5:12">5:12</span> For when for the time ye ought to be
teachers, ye have need of one to teach you again which are the first
principles of the oracles of God; and are become such as have need of
milk, and not of strong food.

<span id="an_5:13">5:13</span> For every one that useth milk, is
unskillful in the word of righteousness: for he is a babe.

<span id="an_5:14">5:14</span> But strong food belongeth to them that
are of full age, even those who by reason of use have their senses
exercised to discern both good and evil.

<span id="an_6:1">6:1</span> Therefore leaving the principles of the
doctrine of Christ, let us go on to perfection; not laying again the
foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith towards God,

<span id="an_6:2">6:2</span> Of the doctrine of baptisms, and of laying
on of hands, and of the resurrection of the dead, and of eternal
judgment.

<span id="an_6:3">6:3</span> And this will we do, if God permit.

<span id="an_6:4">6:4</span> For it is impossible for those who have
been once enlightened, and have tasted the heavenly gift, and have been
made partakers of the Holy Spirit.

<span id="an_6:5">6:5</span> And have tasted the good word of God, and
the powers of the world to come,

<span id="an_6:6">6:6</span> If they shall fall away, to renew them
again to repentance; seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God
afresh, and put him to an open shame.

<span id="an_6:7">6:7</span> For the earth which drinketh in the rain
that cometh often upon it, and bringeth forth herbs fit for them by whom
it is dressed, receiveth blessing from God:

<span id="an_6:8">6:8</span> But that which beareth thorns and briers is
rejected, and is nigh to cursing; whose end is to be burned.

<span id="an_6:9">6:9</span> But, beloved, we are persuaded better
things of you, and things that accompany salvation, though we thus
speak.

<span id="an_6:10">6:10</span> For God is not unrighteous to forget your
work and labor of love, which ye have shown towards his name, in that ye
have ministered to the saints, and do minister.

<span id="an_6:11">6:11</span> And we desire every one of you to show
the same diligence to the full assurance of hope to the end:

<span id="an_6:12">6:12</span> That ye be not slothful, but followers of
them who through faith and patience inherit the promises.

<span id="an_6:13">6:13</span> For when God made promise to Abraham,
because he could swear by no greater, he swore by himself,

<span id="an_6:14">6:14</span> Saying, Surely blessing I will bless
thee, and multiplying I will multiply thee.

<span id="an_6:15">6:15</span> And so, after he had patiently endured,
he obtained the promise.

<span id="an_6:16">6:16</span> For men verily swear by the greater: and
an oath for confirmation is to them an end of all contradiction.

<span id="an_6:17">6:17</span> Wherein God, willing more abundantly to
show to the heirs of promise the immutability of his counsel, confirmed
it by an oath:

<span id="an_6:18">6:18</span> That by two immutable things, in which it
was impossible for God to lie, we might have a strong consolation, who
have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us:

<span id="an_6:19">6:19</span> Which hope we have as an anchor of the
soul, both sure and steadfast, and which entereth into that within the
vail;

<span id="an_6:20">6:20</span> Whither the forerunner hath for us
entered, even Jesus, made a high priest for ever after the order of
Melchisedec.

<span id="an_7:1">7:1</span> For this Melchisedec, king of Salem, priest
of the most high God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of
the kings, and blessed him;

<span id="an_7:2">7:2</span> To whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of
all; first being by interpretation King of righteousness, and after that
also King of Salem, which is, King of peace;

<span id="an_7:3">7:3</span> Without father, without mother, without
descent, having neither beginning of days, nor end of life; but made
like to the Son of God; abideth a priest continually.

<span id="an_7:4">7:4</span> Now consider how great this man was, to
whom even the patriarch Abraham gave the tenth of the spoils.

<span id="an_7:5">7:5</span> And verily they that are of the sons of
Levi, who receive the office of the priesthood, have a commandment to
take tithes from the people according to the law, that is, from their
brethren, though they come from the loins of Abraham:

<span id="an_7:6">7:6</span> But he whose descent is not counted from
them received tithes from Abraham, and blessed him that had the
promises.

<span id="an_7:7">7:7</span> And without all contradiction the less is
blessed by the better.

<span id="an_7:8">7:8</span> And here men that die receive tithes; but
there he receiveth them, of whom it is testified that he liveth.

<span id="an_7:9">7:9</span> And as I may say, Levi also, who receiveth
tithes, payed tithes in Abraham.

<span id="an_7:10">7:10</span> For he was yet in the loins of his
father, when Melchisedec met him.

<span id="an_7:11">7:11</span> If therefore perfection were by the
Levitical priesthood (for under it the people received the law) what
further need was there that another priest should rise after the order
of Melchisedec, and not be called after the order of Aaron?

<span id="an_7:12">7:12</span> For the priesthood being changed, there
is made of necessity a change also of the law.

<span id="an_7:13">7:13</span> For he of whom these things are spoken
pertaineth to another tribe, of which no man gave attendance at the
altar.

<span id="an_7:14">7:14</span> For it is evident that our Lord sprang
from Judah; of which tribe Moses spoke nothing concerning priesthood.

<span id="an_7:15">7:15</span> And it is yet far more evident: for that
after the similitude of Melchisedec there ariseth another priest,

<span id="an_7:16">7:16</span> Who is made, not after the law of a
carnal commandment, but after the power of an endless life.

<span id="an_7:17">7:17</span> For he testifieth, Thou art a priest for
ever after the order of Melchisedec.

<span id="an_7:18">7:18</span> For there is verily a disannulling of the
preceding commandment on account of its weakness and unprofitableness.

<span id="an_7:19">7:19</span> For the law made nothing perfect, but the
introduction of a better hope did; by which we draw nigh to God.

<span id="an_7:20">7:20</span> And inasmuch as not without an oath he
was made priest:

<span id="an_7:21">7:21</span> (For those priests were made without an
oath; but this with an oath, by him that said to him, The Lord swore,
and will not repent, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of
Melchisedec:)

<span id="an_7:22">7:22</span> By so much was Jesus made a surety of a
better testament.

<span id="an_7:23">7:23</span> And they truly were many priests, because
they were not suffered to continue by reason of death:

<span id="an_7:24">7:24</span> But this man, because he continueth ever,
hath an unchangeable priesthood.

<span id="an_7:25">7:25</span> Wherefore he is able also to save them to
the uttermost that come to God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make
intercession for them.

<span id="an_7:26">7:26</span> For such a high priest became us, who is
holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, and made higher than
the heavens;

<span id="an_7:27">7:27</span> Who needeth not daily, as those high
priests, to offer up sacrifice, first for his own sins, and then for the
people's: for this he did once, when he offered up himself.

<span id="an_7:28">7:28</span> For the law maketh men high priests who
have infirmity; but the word of the oath, which was after the law,
maketh the Son, who is consecrated for evermore.

<span id="an_8:1">8:1</span> Now of the things which we have spoken this
is the sum: We have such a high priest, who is set on the right hand of
the throne of the Majesty in the heavens;

<span id="an_8:2">8:2</span> A minister of the sanctuary, and of the
true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, and not man.

<span id="an_8:3">8:3</span> For every high priest is ordained to offer
gifts and sacrifices: wherefore it is of necessity that this man should
have somewhat also to offer.

<span id="an_8:4">8:4</span> For if he were on earth, he would not be a
priest, seeing there are priests that offer gifts according to the law:

<span id="an_8:5">8:5</span> Who serve to the example and shadow of
heavenly things, as Moses was admonished by God when he was about to
make the tabernacle: for, See (saith he) that thou make all things
according to the pattern shown to thee in the mount.

<span id="an_8:6">8:6</span> But now hath he obtained a more excellent
ministry, by how much also he is the mediator of a better covenant,
which was established upon better promises.

<span id="an_8:7">8:7</span> For if that first covenant had been
faultless, then would no place have been sought for the second.

<span id="an_8:8">8:8</span> For finding fault with them, he saith,
Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, when I will make a new covenant
with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah:

<span id="an_8:9">8:9</span> Not according to the covenant that I made
with their fathers, in the day when I took them by the hand to lead them
out of the land of Egypt; because they continued not in my covenant, and
I regarded them not, saith the Lord.

<span id="an_8:10">8:10</span> For this is the covenant that I will make
with the house of Israel after those days, saith the Lord; I will put my
laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts: and I will be to
them a God, and they shall be to me a people:

<span id="an_8:11">8:11</span> And they shall not teach every man his
neighbor, and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for all
shall know me, from the least to the greatest.

<span id="an_8:12">8:12</span> For I will be merciful to their
unrighteousness, and their sins and their iniquities will I remember no
more.

<span id="an_8:13">8:13</span> In that he saith, A new covenant, he hath
made the first old. Now that which decayeth and groweth old is ready to
vanish away.

<span id="an_9:1">9:1</span> Then verily the first covenant had also
ordinances of divine service, and a worldly sanctuary.

<span id="an_9:2">9:2</span> For there was a tabernacle made; the first,
in which was the candlestick, and the table, and the show-bread; which
is called the sanctuary.

<span id="an_9:3">9:3</span> And after the second vail, the tabernacle
which is called the Holiest of all;

<span id="an_9:4">9:4</span> Which had the golden censer, and the ark of
the covenant overlaid around with gold, in which was the golden pot that
had manna, and Aaron's rod that budded, and the tables of the covenant;

<span id="an_9:5">9:5</span> And over it the cherubim of glory shadowing
the mercy-seat; of which we cannot now speak particularly.

<span id="an_9:6">9:6</span> Now when these things were thus ordained,
the priests went always into the first tabernacle, accomplishing the
service of God:

<span id="an_9:7">9:7</span> But into the second went the high priest
alone once every year, not without blood, which he offered for himself,
and for the errors of the people:

<span id="an_9:8">9:8</span> The Holy Spirit this signifying, that the
way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest, while the first
tabernacle was yet standing:

<span id="an_9:9">9:9</span> Which was a figure for the time then
present, in which were offered both gifts and sacrifices, that could not
make him that did the service perfect, as pertaining to the conscience;

<span id="an_9:10">9:10</span> Which stood only in meats and drinks, and
divers washings, and carnal ordinances, imposed on them until the time
of reformation.

<span id="an_9:11">9:11</span> But Christ being come a high priest of
good things to come, by a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made
with hands, that is to say, not of this building;

<span id="an_9:12">9:12</span> Neither by the blood of goats and calves,
but by his own blood; he entered in once into the holy place, having
obtained eternal redemption for us.

<span id="an_9:13">9:13</span> For if the blood of bulls and of goats,
and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling the unclean, sanctify to the
purifying of the flesh:

<span id="an_9:14">9:14</span> How much more shall the blood of Christ,
who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God,
cleanse your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?

<span id="an_9:15">9:15</span> And for this cause he is the mediator of
the new testament, that by means of death, for the redemption of the
transgressions that were under the first testament, they who are called
may receive the promise of eternal inheritance.

<span id="an_9:16">9:16</span> For where a testament is, there must also
of necessity be the death of the testator.

<span id="an_9:17">9:17</span> For a testament is of force after men are
dead: otherwise it is of no strength at all while the testator liveth.

<span id="an_9:18">9:18</span> Hence even the first testament was not
dedicated without blood.

<span id="an_9:19">9:19</span> For when Moses had spoken every precept
to all the people according to the law, he took the blood of calves and
of goats, with water, and scarlet wool, and hyssop, and sprinkled both
the book and all the people,

<span id="an_9:20">9:20</span> Saying, This is the blood of the
testament which God hath enjoined to you.

<span id="an_9:21">9:21</span> Moreover, he sprinkled likewise with
blood both the tabernacle, and all the vessels of the ministry.

<span id="an_9:22">9:22</span> And almost all things are by the law
cleansed with blood; and without shedding of blood is no remission.

<span id="an_9:23">9:23</span> It was therefore necessary that the
patterns of things in the heavens should be purified with these; but the
heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these.

<span id="an_9:24">9:24</span> For Christ hath not entered into the holy
places made with hands, which are the figures of the true; but into
heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us:

<span id="an_9:25">9:25</span> Nor yet that he should offer himself
often, as the high priest entereth into the holy place every year with
blood of others;

<span id="an_9:26">9:26</span> For then must he often have suffered
since the foundation of the world: but now once in the end of the world
hath he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.

<span id="an_9:27">9:27</span> And as it is appointed to men once to
die, but after this the judgment:

<span id="an_9:28">9:28</span> So Christ was once offered to bear the
sins of many; and to them that look for him he will appear the second
time without sin to salvation.

<span id="an_10:1">10:1</span> For the law having a shadow of good
things to come, and not the very image of the things, can never with
those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the
comers to them perfect.

<span id="an_10:2">10:2</span> For then would they not have ceased to be
offered? because that the worshipers once cleansed, would have had no
more conscience of sins.

<span id="an_10:3">10:3</span> But in those sacrifices there is a
remembrance again made of sins every year.

<span id="an_10:4">10:4</span> For it is not possible that the blood of
bulls and of goats should take away sins.

<span id="an_10:5">10:5</span> Wherefore, when he cometh into the world,
he saith, Sacrifice and offering thou wouldst not, but a body hast thou
prepared me:

<span id="an_10:6">10:6</span> In burnt-offerings and sacrifices for sin
thou hast had no pleasure.

<span id="an_10:7">10:7</span> Then said I, Lo, I come (in the volume of
the book it is written concerning me,) to do thy will, O God.

<span id="an_10:8">10:8</span> Above, when he said, Sacrifice and
offering and burnt-offerings and offering for sin thou wouldst not,
neither hadst pleasure in them; which are offered by the law;

<span id="an_10:9">10:9</span> Then said he, Lo, I come to do thy will,
O God. He taketh away the first, that he may establish the second.

<span id="an_10:10">10:10</span> By which will we are sanctified through
the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.

<span id="an_10:11">10:11</span> And every priest standeth daily
ministering and offering often the same sacrifices, which can never take
away sins:

<span id="an_10:12">10:12</span> But this man, after he had offered one
sacrifice for sins, for ever sat down on the right hand of God;

<span id="an_10:13">10:13</span> From henceforth waiting till his
enemies are made his footstool.

<span id="an_10:14">10:14</span> For by one offering he hath perfected
for ever them that are sanctified.

<span id="an_10:15">10:15</span> Of this the Holy Spirit also is a
witness to us: for after that he had said before,

<span id="an_10:16">10:16</span> This is the covenant that I will make
with them after those days, saith the Lord, I will put my laws into
their hearts, and in their minds will I write them;

<span id="an_10:17">10:17</span> And their sins and iniquities will I
remember no more.

<span id="an_10:18">10:18</span> Now where remission of these is, there
is no more offering for sin.

<span id="an_10:19">10:19</span> Having therefore, brethren, boldness to
enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus,

<span id="an_10:20">10:20</span> By a new and living way, which he hath
consecrated for us, through the vail, that is to say, his flesh;

<span id="an_10:21">10:21</span> And having a high priest over the house
of God;

<span id="an_10:22">10:22</span> Let us draw near with a true heart in
full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil
conscience, and our bodies washed with pure water.

<span id="an_10:23">10:23</span> Let us hold fast the profession of our
faith without wavering; for he is faithful that promised:

<span id="an_10:24">10:24</span> And let us consider one another to
excite to love and to good works:

<span id="an_10:25">10:25</span> Not forsaking the assembling of
ourselves, as the manner of some is; but exhorting one another: and so
much the more, as ye see the day approaching.

<span id="an_10:26">10:26</span> For if we sin willfully after we have
received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more sacrifice
for sins,

<span id="an_10:27">10:27</span> But a certain fearful apprehension of
judgment and fiery indignation, which shall devour the adversaries.

<span id="an_10:28">10:28</span> He that despised Moses' law, died
without mercy under two or three witnesses:

<span id="an_10:29">10:29</span> Of how much more severe punishment,
suppose ye, shall he be thought worthy, who hath trodden under foot the
Son of God, and hath counted the blood of the covenant, by which he was
sanctified, an unholy thing, and hath done despite to the Spirit of
grace?

<span id="an_10:30">10:30</span> For we know him that hath said,
Vengeance belongeth to me, I will recompense, saith the Lord. And again,
The Lord will judge his people.

<span id="an_10:31">10:31</span> It is a fearful thing to fall into the
hands of the living God.

<span id="an_10:32">10:32</span> But call to remembrance the former
days, in which, after ye were illuminated, ye endured a great fight of
afflictions;

<span id="an_10:33">10:33</span> Partly, while ye were made a
gazing-stock both by reproaches and afflictions; and partly, while ye
became companions of them that were so used.

<span id="an_10:34">10:34</span> For ye had compassion of me in my
bonds, and took joyfully the seizing of your goods, knowing in
yourselves that ye have in heaven a better and an enduring substance.

<span id="an_10:35">10:35</span> Cast not away therefore your
confidence, which hath great recompense of reward.

<span id="an_10:36">10:36</span> For ye have need of patience, that,
after ye have done the will of God, ye may receive the promise.

<span id="an_10:37">10:37</span> For yet a little while, and he that is
coming will come, and will not tarry.

<span id="an_10:38">10:38</span> Now the just shall live by faith: but
if any man shall draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him.

<span id="an_10:39">10:39</span> But we are not of them who draw back to
perdition; but of them that believe to the saving of the soul.

<span id="an_11:1">11:1</span> Now faith is the substance of things
hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.

<span id="an_11:2">11:2</span> For by it the elders obtained a good
report.

<span id="an_11:3">11:3</span> Through faith we understand that the
worlds were framed by the word of God, so that things which are seen
were not made of things which appeared.

<span id="an_11:4">11:4</span> By faith Abel offered to God a more
excellent sacrifice than Cain, by which he obtained testimony that he
was righteous, God testifying of his gifts: and by it he being dead yet
speaketh.

<span id="an_11:5">11:5</span> By faith Enoch was translated, that he
should not see death; and was not found, because God had translated him:
for before his translation he had this testimony, that he pleased God.

<span id="an_11:6">11:6</span> But without faith it is impossible to
please him: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that
he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.

<span id="an_11:7">11:7</span> By faith Noah, being warned by God of
things not seen as yet, moved with fear, prepared an ark to the saving
of his house; by which he condemned the world, and became heir of the
righteousness which is by faith.

<span id="an_11:8">11:8</span> By faith Abraham, when he was called to
remove into a place which he should afterwards receive for an
inheritance, obeyed; and he went out not knowing whither he was going.

<span id="an_11:9">11:9</span> By faith he sojourned in the land of
promise, as in a foreign country, dwelling in tabernacles with Isaac and
Jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise:

<span id="an_11:10">11:10</span> For he looked for a city which hath
foundations, whose builder and maker is God.

<span id="an_11:11">11:11</span> Through faith also Sarah herself
received strength to conceive seed, and was delivered of a child when
she was past age, because she judged him faithful who had promised.

<span id="an_11:12">11:12</span> Therefore there sprang even from one,
and him as good as dead, so many as the stars of the sky in multitude,
and as the sand which is by the sea-shore innumerable.

<span id="an_11:13">11:13</span> These all died in faith, not having
received the promises, but having seen them afar off, and were persuaded
of them, and embraced them, and confessed that they were strangers and
pilgrims on the earth.

<span id="an_11:14">11:14</span> For they that say such things declare
plainly that they seek a country.

<span id="an_11:15">11:15</span> And truly, if they had been mindful of
that country from whence they came, they might have had opportunity to
return.

<span id="an_11:16">11:16</span> But now they desire a better country,
that is, a heavenly: wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their
God; for he hath prepared for them a city.

<span id="an_11:17">11:17</span> By faith Abraham, when he was tried,
offered up Isaac: and he that had received the promises offered up his
only-begotten son,

<span id="an_11:18">11:18</span> Of whom it was said, That in Isaac
shall thy seed be called:

<span id="an_11:19">11:19</span> Accounting that God was able to raise
him even from the dead; from whence also he received him in a figure.

<span id="an_11:20">11:20</span> By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau
concerning things to come.

<span id="an_11:21">11:21</span> By faith Jacob, when he was dying,
blessed both the sons of Joseph; and worshiped, leaning upon the top of
his staff.

<span id="an_11:22">11:22</span> By faith Joseph, when he died, made
mention of the departing of the children of Israel; and gave commandment
concerning his bones.

<span id="an_11:23">11:23</span> By faith Moses when he was born, was
hid three months by his parents, because they saw he was a proper child;
and they were not afraid of the king's commandment.

<span id="an_11:24">11:24</span> By faith Moses, when he had come to
years, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter;

<span id="an_11:25">11:25</span> Choosing rather to suffer affliction
with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season;

<span id="an_11:26">11:26</span> Esteeming the reproach of Christ
greater riches than the treasures of Egypt: for he had respect to the
recompense of the reward.

<span id="an_11:27">11:27</span> By faith he forsook Egypt, not fearing
the wrath of the king: for he endured, as seeing him who is invisible.

<span id="an_11:28">11:28</span> Through faith he kept the passover, and
the sprinkling of blood, lest he that destroyed the first-born should
touch them.

<span id="an_11:29">11:29</span> By faith they passed through the Red
sea as by dry land: which the Egyptians essaying to do were drowned.

<span id="an_11:30">11:30</span> By faith the walls of Jericho fell down
after they had been encompassed seven days.

<span id="an_11:31">11:31</span> By faith the harlot Rahab perished not
with them that believed not, as she had received the spies with peace.

<span id="an_11:32">11:32</span> And what shall I say more? for the time
would fail me to tell of Gideon, and of Barak, and of Samson, and of
Jephthah, of David also, and Samuel, and of the prophets:

<span id="an_11:33">11:33</span> Who through faith subdued kingdoms,
wrought righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions,

<span id="an_11:34">11:34</span> Quenched the violence of fire, escaped
the edge of the sword, out of weakness were made strong, became valiant
in fight, turned to flight the armies of the aliens.

<span id="an_11:35">11:35</span> Women received their dead raised to
life again: and others were tortured, not accepting deliverance; that
they might obtain a better resurrection:

<span id="an_11:36">11:36</span> And others had trial of cruel mockings
and scourgings, and, moreover of bonds and imprisonment:

<span id="an_11:37">11:37</span> They were stoned, they were sawn
asunder, were tempted, were slain with the sword: they wandered about in
sheep-skins, and goat-skins; being destitute, afflicted, tormented;

<span id="an_11:38">11:38</span> (Of whom the world was not worthy:)
they wandered in deserts, and in mountains, and in dens and caves of the
earth.

<span id="an_11:39">11:39</span> And these all, having obtained a good
report through faith, received not the promise:

<span id="an_11:40">11:40</span> God having provided some better thing
for us, that they without us should not be made perfect.

<span id="an_12:1">12:1</span> Wherefore, seeing we also are encompassed
with so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and
the sin which doth so easily beset us, and let us run with patience the
race that is set before us,

<span id="an_12:2">12:2</span> Looking to Jesus the author and finisher
of our faith; who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross,
despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of
God.

<span id="an_12:3">12:3</span> For consider him that endured such
contradiction of sinners against himself, lest ye be wearied and faint
in your minds.

<span id="an_12:4">12:4</span> Ye have not yet resisted to blood,
striving against sin.

<span id="an_12:5">12:5</span> And ye have forgotten the exhortation
which speaketh to you as to children, My son, despise not thou the
chastening of the Lord, nor faint when thou art rebuked by him:

<span id="an_12:6">12:6</span> For whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth,
and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth.

<span id="an_12:7">12:7</span> If ye endure chastening, God dealeth with
you as with sons: for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not?

<span id="an_12:8">12:8</span> But if ye are without chastisement, of
which all are partakers, then are ye bastards and not sons.

<span id="an_12:9">12:9</span> Furthermore, we have had fathers of our
flesh who corrected us, and we gave them reverence: shall we not much
rather be in subjection to the Father of spirits, and live?

<span id="an_12:10">12:10</span> For they verily for a few days
chastened us after their own pleasure; but he for our profit, that we
might be partakers of his holiness.

<span id="an_12:11">12:11</span> Now no chastening for the present
seemeth to be joyous, but grievous: nevertheless, afterward it yieldeth
the peaceable fruit of righteousness to them who are exercised by it.

<span id="an_12:12">12:12</span> Wherefore lift up the hands which hang
down, and the feeble knees;

<span id="an_12:13">12:13</span> And make straight paths for your feet,
lest that which is lame be turned out of the way; but let it rather be
healed.

<span id="an_12:14">12:14</span> Follow peace with all men, and
holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord:

<span id="an_12:15">12:15</span> Looking diligently, lest any man fail
of the grace of God; lest any root of bitterness springing up, trouble
you, and by it many be defiled;

<span id="an_12:16">12:16</span> Lest there be any fornicator, or
profane person, as Esau, who for one morsel of food sold his
birth-right.

<span id="an_12:17">12:17</span> For ye know that afterward, when he
would have inherited the blessing, he was rejected: for he found no
place of repentance, though he sought it carefully with tears.

<span id="an_12:18">12:18</span> For ye are not come to the mount that
might be touched, and that burned with fire, nor to blackness, and to
darkness, and tempest,

<span id="an_12:19">12:19</span> And the sound of a trumpet, and the
voice of words; which voice they that heard, entreated that the word
should not be spoken to them any more:

<span id="an_12:20">12:20</span> (For they could not endure that which
was commanded, And if so much as a beast touch the mountain, it shall be
stoned, or thrust through with a dart:

<span id="an_12:21">12:21</span> And so terrible was the sight, that
Moses said, I exceedingly fear and tremble:)

<span id="an_12:22">12:22</span> But ye are come to mount Sion, and to
the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an
innumerable company of angels,

<span id="an_12:23">12:23</span> To the general assembly and church of
the first-born, who are written in heaven, and to God the Judge of all,
and to the spirits of just men made perfect,

<span id="an_12:24">12:24</span> And to Jesus the mediator of the new
covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling, that speaketh better things
than that of Abel.

<span id="an_12:25">12:25</span> See that ye refuse not him that
speaketh. For if they escaped not who refused him that spoke on earth,
much more shall not we escape, if we turn away from him that speaketh
from heaven:

<span id="an_12:26">12:26</span> Whose voice then shook the earth: but
now he hath promised, saying, Yet once more I shake not the earth only,
but also heaven.

<span id="an_12:27">12:27</span> And this word, Yet once more,
signifieth the removing of those things that are shaken, as of things
that are made, that those things which cannot be shaken may remain.

<span id="an_12:28">12:28</span> Wherefore we receiving a kingdom which
cannot be moved, let us have grace, by which we may serve God
acceptably, with reverence and godly fear.

<span id="an_12:29">12:29</span> For our God is a consuming fire.

<span id="an_13:1">13:1</span> Let brotherly love continue.

<span id="an_13:2">13:2</span> Be not forgetful to entertain strangers:
for by this some have entertained angels unawares.

<span id="an_13:3">13:3</span> Remember them that are in bonds, as bound
with them; and them who suffer adversity, as being yourselves also in
the body.

<span id="an_13:4">13:4</span> Marriage is honorable in all, and the bed
undefiled: but lewd persons and adulterers God will judge.

<span id="an_13:5">13:5</span> Let your manner of life be without
covetousness; and be content with such things as ye have: for he hath
said, I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee.

<span id="an_13:6">13:6</span> So that we may boldly say, The Lord is my
helper, and I will not fear what man shall do to me.

<span id="an_13:7">13:7</span> Remember them who have the rule over you,
who have spoken to you the word of God: whose faith follow, considering
the end of their manner of life.

<span id="an_13:8">13:8</span> Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and
to-day, and for ever.

<span id="an_13:9">13:9</span> Be not carried about with divers and
strange doctrines: for it is a good thing that the heart be established
with grace; not with meats, which have not profited them that have been
occupied in them.

<span id="an_13:10">13:10</span> We have an altar, of which they have no
right to eat who serve the tabernacle.

<span id="an_13:11">13:11</span> For the bodies of those beasts, whose
blood is brought into the sanctuary by the high priest for sin, are
burned without the camp.

<span id="an_13:12">13:12</span> Wherefore Jesus also, that he might
sanctify the people with his own blood, suffered without the gate.

<span id="an_13:13">13:13</span> Let us go forth therefore to him
without the camp, bearing his reproach.

<span id="an_13:14">13:14</span> For here we have no continuing city,
but we seek one to come.

<span id="an_13:15">13:15</span> By him therefore let us offer the
sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of our lips,
giving thanks to his name.

<span id="an_13:16">13:16</span> But to do good, and to communicate,
forget not: for with such sacrifices God is well pleased.

<span id="an_13:17">13:17</span> Obey them that have the rule over you,
and submit yourselves: for they watch for your souls, as they that must
give account, that they may do it with joy, and not with grief: for that
is unprofitable for you.

<span id="an_13:18">13:18</span> Pray for us: for we trust we have a
good conscience, in all things willing to live honestly.

<span id="an_13:19">13:19</span> But I beseech you the rather to do
this, that I may be restored to you the sooner.

<span id="an_13:20">13:20</span> Now the God of peace, that brought
again from the dead our Lord Jesus, that great Shepherd of the sheep,
through the blood of the everlasting covenant,

<span id="an_13:21">13:21</span> Make you perfect in every good work to
do his will, working in you that which is well-pleasing in his sight,
through Jesus Christ; to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.

<span id="an_13:22">13:22</span> And I beseech you, brethren, suffer the
word of exhortation: for I have written a letter to you in few words.

<span id="an_13:23">13:23</span> Know ye, that our brother Timothy is
set at liberty; with whom, if he come shortly, I will see you.

<span id="an_13:24">13:24</span> Salute all them that have the rule over
you, and all the saints. They of Italy salute you.

<span id="an_13:25">13:25</span> Grace be with you all. Amen.
