### Webster's Bible: Philemon

<span id="an_1:1">1:1</span> Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ, and
Timothy our brother, to Philemon our dearly beloved, and fellow-laborer,

<span id="an_1:2">1:2</span> And to our beloved Apphia, and Archippus
our fellow-soldier, and to the church in thy house:

<span id="an_1:3">1:3</span> Grace to you, and peace, from God our
Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.

<span id="an_1:4">1:4</span> I thank my God, making mention of thee
always in my prayers,

<span id="an_1:5">1:5</span> Hearing of thy love and faith, which thou
hast towards the Lord Jesus, and towards all saints;

<span id="an_1:6">1:6</span> That the communication of thy faith may
become effectual by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in
you in Christ Jesus.

<span id="an_1:7">1:7</span> For we have great joy and consolation in
thy love, because the bowels of the saints are refreshed by thee,
brother.

<span id="an_1:8">1:8</span> Wherefore, though I might be very bold in
Christ to enjoin thee that which is convenient.

<span id="an_1:9">1:9</span> Yet for love's sake I rather beseech thee,
being such one as Paul the aged, and now also a prisoner of Jesus
Christ.

<span id="an_1:10">1:10</span> I beseech thee for my son Onesimus, whom
I have begotten in my bonds:

<span id="an_1:11">1:11</span> Who in time past was to thee
unprofitable, but now profitable to thee and to me:

<span id="an_1:12">1:12</span> Whom I have sent again: thou therefore
receive him, that is, my own bowels:

<span id="an_1:13">1:13</span> Whom I would have retained with me, that
in thy stead he might have ministered to me in the bonds of the gospel:

<span id="an_1:14">1:14</span> But without thy mind I would do nothing;
that thy benefit should not be as it were of necessity, but willingly.

<span id="an_1:15">1:15</span> For perhaps he therefore departed for a
season, that thou shouldst receive him for ever;

<span id="an_1:16">1:16</span> Not now as a servant, but above a
servant, a brother beloved, specially to me, but how much more to thee,
both in the flesh, and in the Lord?

<span id="an_1:17">1:17</span> If thou accountest me therefore a
partner, receive him as myself.

<span id="an_1:18">1:18</span> If he hath wronged thee, or oweth thee
aught, put that on my account;

<span id="an_1:19">1:19</span> I Paul have written it with my own hand,
I will repay it: although I do not say to thee that thou owest to me
even thy own self besides.

<span id="an_1:20">1:20</span> Yes, brother, let me have joy of thee in
the Lord: refresh my bowels in the Lord.

<span id="an_1:21">1:21</span> Having confidence in thy obedience I
wrote to thee, knowing that thou wilt also do more than I say.

<span id="an_1:22">1:22</span> But at the same time prepare me also a
lodging; for I trust that through your prayers I shall be given to you.

<span id="an_1:23">1:23</span> There salute thee Epaphras, my
fellow-prisoner in Christ Jesus;

<span id="an_1:24">1:24</span> Marcus, Aristarchus, Demas, Lucas, my
fellow-laborers.

<span id="an_1:25">1:25</span> The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be
with your spirit. Amen.
