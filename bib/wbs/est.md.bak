### Webster's Bible: Esther

<span id="an_1:1">1:1</span> Now it came to pass in the days of
Ahasuerus, (this is Ahasuerus who reigned from India even to Cush, over
a hundred and seven and twenty provinces:)

<span id="an_1:2">1:2</span> That in those days, when the king Ahasuerus
sat on the throne of his kingdom, which was in Shushan the palace,

<span id="an_1:3">1:3</span> In the third year of his reign, he made a
feast to all his princes and his servants; the power of Persia and
Media, the nobles and princes of the provinces, being before him:

<span id="an_1:4">1:4</span> When he showed the riches of his glorious
kingdom and the honor of his excellent majesty many days, even a hundred
and eighty days.

<span id="an_1:5">1:5</span> And when these days had expired, the king
made a feast for all the people that were present in Shushan the palace,
both for great and small, seven days, in the court of the garden of the
king's palace;

<span id="an_1:6">1:6</span> Where were white, green, and blue hangings,
fastened with cords of fine linen and purple to silver rings and pillars
of marble: the beds were of gold and silver, upon a pavement of red, and
blue, and white, and black marble.

<span id="an_1:7">1:7</span> And they gave them drink in vessels of
gold, (the vessels being diverse one from another,) and royal wine in
abundance, according to the state of the king.

<span id="an_1:8">1:8</span> And the drinking was according to the law;
none constrained: for so the king had appointed to all the officers of
his house, that they should do according to every man's pleasure.

<span id="an_1:9">1:9</span> Also Vashti the queen made a feast for the
women in the royal house which belonged to king Ahasuerus.

<span id="an_1:10">1:10</span> On the seventh day, when the heart of the
king was merry with wine, he commanded Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha,
and Abagtha, Zethar, and Carcas, the seven chamberlains that served in
the presence of Ahasuerus the king,

<span id="an_1:11">1:11</span> To bring Vashti the queen before the king
with the crown royal, to show the people and the princes her beauty: for
she was fair to look on.

<span id="an_1:12">1:12</span> But the queen Vashti refused to come at
the king's commandment by his chamberlains: therefore was the king very
wroth, and his anger burned in him.

<span id="an_1:13">1:13</span> Then the king said to the wise men, who
knew the times, (for so was the king's manner towards all that knew law
and judgment:

<span id="an_1:14">1:14</span> And the next to him was Carshena,
Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, and Memucan, the seven
princes of Persia and Media, who saw the king's face, and who sat the
first in the kingdom;)

<span id="an_1:15">1:15</span> What shall we do to the queen Vashti
according to law, because she hath not performed the commandment of the
king Ahasuerus by the chamberlains?

<span id="an_1:16">1:16</span> And Memucan answered before the king and
the princes, Vashti the queen hath not done wrong to the king only, but
also to all the princes, and to all the people that are in all the
provinces of the king Ahasuerus.

<span id="an_1:17">1:17</span> For this deed of the queen will come
abroad to all women, so that they will despise their husbands in their
eyes, when it shall be reported, The king Ahasuerus commanded Vashti the
queen to be brought in before him, but she came not.

<span id="an_1:18">1:18</span> Likewise will the ladies of Persia and
Media say this day to all the king's princes, who have heard of the deed
of the queen. Thus will there arise too much contempt and wrath.

<span id="an_1:19">1:19</span> If it pleaseth the king, let a royal
commandment go from him, and let it be written among the laws of the
Persians and the Medes, that it be not altered, That Vashti come no more
before king Ahasuerus; and let the king give her royal estate to another
that is better than she.

<span id="an_1:20">1:20</span> And when the king's decree which he shall
make shall be published throughout all his empire, (for it is great,)
all the wives will give to their husbands honor, both to great and
small.

<span id="an_1:21">1:21</span> And the saying pleased the king and the
princes; and the king did according to the word of Memucan:

<span id="an_1:22">1:22</span> For he sent letters into all the king's
provinces, into every province according to the writing of it, and to
every people after their language, that every man should bear rule in
his own house, and that it should be published according to the language
of every people.

<span id="an_2:1">2:1</span> After these things, when the wrath of king
Ahasuerus was appeased, he remembered Vashti, and what she had done, and
what was decreed against her.

<span id="an_2:2">2:2</span> Then said the king's servants that
ministered to him, Let there be fair young virgins sought for the king:

<span id="an_2:3">2:3</span> And let the king appoint officers in all
the provinces of his kingdom, that they may collect all the fair young
virgins to Shushan the palace, to the house of the women, into the
custody of Hege the king's chamberlain, keeper of the women; and let
their things for purification be given them:

<span id="an_2:4">2:4</span> And let the maiden who pleaseth the king be
queen instead of Vashti. And the thing pleased the king; and he did so.

<span id="an_2:5">2:5</span> Now in Shushan the palace there was a
certain Jew, whose name was Mordecai, the son of Jair, the son of
Shimei, the son of Kish, a Benjaminite;

<span id="an_2:6">2:6</span> Who had been carried away from Jerusalem
with the captivity which had been carried away with Jeconiah king of
Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away.

<span id="an_2:7">2:7</span> And he brought up Hadassah, that is,
Esther, his uncle's daughter: for she had neither father nor mother, and
the maid was fair and beautiful; whom Mordecai, when her father and
mother were dead, took for his own daughter.

<span id="an_2:8">2:8</span> So it came to pass, when the king's
commandment and his decree were heard, and when many maidens were
assembled at Shushan the palace, to the custody of Hegai, that Esther
was brought also to the king's house, to the custody of Hegai, keeper of
the women.

<span id="an_2:9">2:9</span> And the maiden pleased him, and she
obtained kindness from him; and he speedily gave her her things for
purification, with such things as belonged to her, and seven maidens who
were meet to be given her, out of the king's house: and he preferred her
and her maids to the best place of the house of the women.

<span id="an_2:10">2:10</span> Esther had not showed her people nor her
kindred: for Mordecai had charged her that she should not show it.

<span id="an_2:11">2:11</span> And Mordecai walked every day before the
court of the women's house, to know how Esther did, and what would
become of her.

<span id="an_2:12">2:12</span> Now when every maid's turn had come to go
in to king Ahasuerus, after that she had been twelve months, according
to the manner of the women, (for so were the days of their purifications
accomplished, to wit, six months with oil of myrrh, and six months with
sweet odors, and with other things for the purifying of the women;)

<span id="an_2:13">2:13</span> Then thus came every maiden to the king;
whatever she desired was given her to go with her out of the house of
the women to the king's house.

<span id="an_2:14">2:14</span> In the evening she went, and on the
morrow she returned into the second house of the women, to the custody
of Shaashgaz, the king's chamberlain, who kept the concubines: she came
in to the king no more, except that the king delighted in her, and she
was called by name.

<span id="an_2:15">2:15</span> Now when the turn of Esther, the daughter
of Abihail the uncle of Mordecai, who had taken her for his daughter,
had come to go in to the king, she required nothing but what Hegai the
king's chamberlain, the keeper of the women, appointed. And Esther
obtained favor in the sight of all them that looked upon her.

<span id="an_2:16">2:16</span> So Esther was taken to king Ahasuerus
into his house royal in the tenth month, which is the month Tebeth, in
the seventh year of his reign.

<span id="an_2:17">2:17</span> And the king loved Esther above all the
women, and she obtained grace and favor in his sight more than all the
virgins; so that he set the royal crown upon her head, and made her
queen instead of Vashti.

<span id="an_2:18">2:18</span> Then the king made a great feast to all
his princes and his servants, even Esther's feast; and he made a release
to the provinces, and gave gifts, according to the state of the king.

<span id="an_2:19">2:19</span> And when the virgins were assembled the
second time, then Mordecai sat in the king's gate.

<span id="an_2:20">2:20</span> Esther had not yet showed her kindred,
nor her people; as Mordecai had charged her: for Esther performed the
commandment of Mordecai, as when she was brought up with him.

<span id="an_2:21">2:21</span> In those days, while Mordecai sat in the
king's gate, two of the king's chamberlains, Bigthan and Teresh, of
those who kept the door, were wroth, and sought to lay hand on the king
Ahasuerus.

<span id="an_2:22">2:22</span> And the thing was known to Mordecai, who
told it to Esther the queen; and Esther certified the king of it in
Mordecai's name.

<span id="an_2:23">2:23</span> And when inquisition was made of the
matter, it was discovered; therefore they were both hanged on a tree:
and it was written in the book of the chronicles before the king.

<span id="an_3:1">3:1</span> After these things king Ahasuerus promoted
Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, and advanced him, and set his
seat above all the princes that were with him.

<span id="an_3:2">3:2</span> And all the king's servants that were in
the king's gate, bowed, and reverenced Haman; for the king had so
commanded concerning him. But Mordecai bowed not, nor did him reverence.

<span id="an_3:3">3:3</span> Then the king's servants who were in the
king's gate, said to Mordecai, Why dost thou transgress the king's
commandment?

<span id="an_3:4">3:4</span> Now it came to pass, when they spoke daily
to him, and he hearkened not to them, that they told Haman, to see
whether Mordecai's matters would stand: for he had told them that he was
a Jew.

<span id="an_3:5">3:5</span> And when Haman saw that Mordecai bowed not,
nor did him reverence, then was Haman full of wrath.

<span id="an_3:6">3:6</span> And he scorned to lay hands on Mordecai
alone; for they had shown him the people of Mordecai: wherefore Haman
sought to destroy all the Jews that were throughout the whole kingdom of
Ahasuerus, even the people of Mordecai.

<span id="an_3:7">3:7</span> In the first month, (that is, the month
Nisan,) in the twelfth year of king Ahasuerus, they cast Pur, that is,
the lot, before Haman from day to day, and from month to month, to the
twelfth month, that is, the month Adar.

<span id="an_3:8">3:8</span> And Haman said to king Ahasuerus, There is
a certain people scattered abroad and dispersed among the people in all
the provinces of thy kingdom; and their laws are diverse from all
people; neither keep they the king's laws: therefore it is not for the
king's profit to suffer them.

<span id="an_3:9">3:9</span> If it shall please the king, let it be
written that they may be destroyed: and I will pay ten thousand talents
of silver to the hands of those that have the charge of the business, to
bring it into the king's treasuries.

<span id="an_3:10">3:10</span> And the king took his ring from his hand,
and gave it to Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the Jews enemy.

<span id="an_3:11">3:11</span> And the king said to Haman, The silver is
given to thee, the people also, to do with them as it seemeth good to
thee.

<span id="an_3:12">3:12</span> Then were the king's scribes called on
the thirteenth day of the first month, and there was written according
to all that Haman had commanded to the king's lieutenants, and to the
governors that were over every province, and to the rulers of every
people of every province, according to the writing of it, and to every
people after their language; in the name of king Ahasuerus was it
written, and sealed with the king's ring.

<span id="an_3:13">3:13</span> And the letters were sent by posts into
all the king's provinces, to destroy, to kill, and to cause to perish,
all Jews, both young and old, little children and women, in one day,
even upon the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month
Adar, and to take the spoil of them for a prey.

<span id="an_3:14">3:14</span> The copy of the writing for a commandment
to be given in every province, was published to all people, that they
should be ready against that day.

<span id="an_3:15">3:15</span> The posts departed, being hastened by the
king's commandment, and the decree was given in Shushan the palace. And
the king and Haman sat down to drink; but the city Shushan was
perplexed.

<span id="an_4:1">4:1</span> When Mordecai perceived all that was done,
Mordecai rent his clothes, and put on sackcloth with ashes, and went out
into the midst of the city, and cried with a loud and a bitter cry;

<span id="an_4:2">4:2</span> And came even before the king's gate: for
none might enter into the king's gate clothed with sackcloth.

<span id="an_4:3">4:3</span> And in every province whithersoever the
king's commandment and his decree came, there was great mourning among
the Jews, and fasting, and weeping, and wailing; and many lay in
sackcloth and ashes.

<span id="an_4:4">4:4</span> So Esther's maids and her chamberlains came
and told it to her. Then was the queen exceedingly grieved; and she sent
raiment to clothe Mordecai, and to take away his sackcloth from him: but
he received it not.

<span id="an_4:5">4:5</span> Then called Esther for Hatach, one of the
king's chamberlains, whom he had appointed to attend upon her, and gave
him a commandment to Mordecai, to know what it was, and why it was.

<span id="an_4:6">4:6</span> So Hatach went forth to Mordecai, to the
street of the city, which was before the king's gate.

<span id="an_4:7">4:7</span> And Mordecai told him all that had happened
to him, and of the sum of the money that Haman had promised to pay to
the king's treasuries for the Jews, to destroy them.

<span id="an_4:8">4:8</span> Also he gave him the copy of the writing of
the decree that was given at Shushan to destroy them, to show it to
Esther, and to declare it to her, and to charge her that she should go
in to the king, to make supplication to him, and to make request before
him for her people.

<span id="an_4:9">4:9</span> And Hatach came and told Esther the words
of Mordecai.

<span id="an_4:10">4:10</span> Again Esther spoke to Hatach, and gave
him commandment to Mordecai;

<span id="an_4:11">4:11</span> All the king's servants, and the people
of the king's provinces, do know, that whoever, whether man or woman,
shall come to the king into the inner court, who is not called, there is
one law of his to put him to death, except him to whom the king shall
hold out the golden scepter, that he may live: but I have not been
called to come in to the king these thirty days.

<span id="an_4:12">4:12</span> And they told to Mordecai Esther's words.

<span id="an_4:13">4:13</span> Then Mordecai commanded to answer Esther,
Think not with thyself that thou shalt escape in the king's house more
than all the Jews.

<span id="an_4:14">4:14</span> For if thou shalt altogether hold thy
peace at this time, then will there enlargement and deliverance arise to
the Jews from another place; but thou and thy father's house will be
destroyed: and who knoweth, whether thou hast come to the kingdom for
such a time as this?

<span id="an_4:15">4:15</span> Then Esther bade them return Mordecai
this answer,

<span id="an_4:16">4:16</span> Go, assemble all the Jews that are
present in Shushan, and fast ye for me, and neither eat nor drink three
days, night or day: I also and my maidens will fast likewise; and so
will I go in to the king, which is not according to the law; and if I
perish, I perish.

<span id="an_4:17">4:17</span> So Mordecai went his way, and did
according to all that Esther had commanded him.

<span id="an_5:1">5:1</span> Now it came to pass on the third day, that
Esther put on her royal apparel, and stood in the inner court of the
king's house, over against the king's house: and the king sat upon his
royal throne in the royal house, over against the gate of the house.

<span id="an_5:2">5:2</span> And it was so, when the king saw Esther the
queen standing in the court, that she obtained favor in his sight: and
the king held out to Esther the golden scepter that was in his hand. So
Esther drew near, and touched the top of the scepter.

<span id="an_5:3">5:3</span> Then said the king to her, What wilt thou,
queen Esther? and what is thy request? it shall be even given thee to
the half of the kingdom.

<span id="an_5:4">5:4</span> And Esther answered, If it shall seem good
to the king, let the king and Haman come this day to the banquet that I
have prepared for him.

<span id="an_5:5">5:5</span> Then the king said, Cause Haman to make
haste, that he may do as Esther hath said. So the king and Haman came to
the banquet that Esther had prepared.

<span id="an_5:6">5:6</span> And the king said to Esther at the banquet
of wine, What is thy petition? and it shall be granted thee: and what is
thy request? even to the half of the kingdom it shall be performed.

<span id="an_5:7">5:7</span> Then answered Esther, and said, My petition
and my request is:

<span id="an_5:8">5:8</span> If I have found favor in the sight of the
king, and if it shall please the king to grant my petition, and to
perform my request, let the king and Haman come to the banquet that I
shall prepare for them, and I will do to-morrow as the king hath said.

<span id="an_5:9">5:9</span> Then went Haman forth that day joyful and
with a glad heart: but when Haman saw Mordecai in the king's gate, that
he stood not up, nor moved for him, he was full of indignation against
Mordecai.

<span id="an_5:10">5:10</span> Nevertheless, Haman refrained himself:
and when he came home, he sent and called for his friends, and Zeresh
his wife.

<span id="an_5:11">5:11</span> And Haman told them of the glory of his
riches, and the multitude of his children, and all the things in which
the king had promoted him, and how he had advanced him above the princes
and servants of the king.

<span id="an_5:12">5:12</span> Haman said moreover, Yes, Esther the
queen let no man come in with the king to the banquet that she had
prepared but myself; and to-morrow I am invited to her also with the
king.

<span id="an_5:13">5:13</span> Yet all this availeth me nothing, so long
as I see Mordecai the Jew sitting at the king's gate.

<span id="an_5:14">5:14</span> Then said Zeresh his wife and all his
friends to him, Let a gallows be made fifty cubits high, and to-morrow
speak thou to the king that Mordecai may be hanged upon it: then go thou
in merrily with the king to the banquet. And the thing pleased Haman;
and he caused the gallows to be made.

<span id="an_6:1">6:1</span> In that night the king could not sleep, and
he commanded to bring the book of records of the chronicles; and they
were read before the king.

<span id="an_6:2">6:2</span> And it was found written, that Mordecai had
informed of Bigthana and Teresh, two of the king's chamberlains, the
keepers of the door, who sought to lay hand on the king Ahasuerus.

<span id="an_6:3">6:3</span> And the king said, What honor and dignity
hath been done to Mordecai for this? Then said the king's servants that
ministered to him, There is nothing done for him.

<span id="an_6:4">6:4</span> And the king said, Who is in the court? Now
Haman had come into the outward court of the king's house, to speak to
the king to hang Mordecai on the gallows that he had prepared for him.

<span id="an_6:5">6:5</span> And the king's servants said to him,
Behold, Haman standeth in the court. And the king said, Let him come in.

<span id="an_6:6">6:6</span> So Haman came in. And the king said to him,
What shall be done to the man whom the king delighteth to honor? Now
Haman thought in his heart, To whom would the king delight to do honor
more than to myself?

<span id="an_6:7">6:7</span> And Haman answered the king, For the man
whom the king delighteth to honor,

<span id="an_6:8">6:8</span> Let the royal apparel be brought which the
king useth to wear, and the horse that the king rideth upon, and the
crown royal which is set upon his head:

<span id="an_6:9">6:9</span> And let this apparel and horse be delivered
to the hand of one of the king's most noble princes, that they may array
the man whom the king delighteth to honor, and bring him on horseback
through the street of the city, and proclaim before him, Thus shall it
be done to the man whom the king delighteth to honor.

<span id="an_6:10">6:10</span> Then the king said to Haman, Make haste,
and take the apparel and the horse, as thou hast said, and do even so to
Mordecai the Jew, that sitteth at the king's gate: let nothing fail of
all that thou hast spoken.

<span id="an_6:11">6:11</span> Then Haman took the apparel and the
horse, and arrayed Mordecai, and brought him on horseback through the
street of the city, and proclaimed before him, Thus shall it be done to
the man whom the king delighteth to honor.

<span id="an_6:12">6:12</span> And Mordecai came again to the king's
gate. But Haman hasted to his house mourning, and having his head
covered.

<span id="an_6:13">6:13</span> And Haman told Zeresh his wife and all
his friends every thing that had befallen him. Then said his wise men
and Zeresh his wife to him, If Mordecai is of the seed of the Jews,
before whom thou hast begun to fall, thou wilt not prevail against him,
but wilt surely fall before him.

<span id="an_6:14">6:14</span> And while they were yet talking with him,
came the king's chamberlains, and hasted to bring Haman to the banquet
that Esther had prepared.

<span id="an_7:1">7:1</span> So the king and Haman came to banquet with
Esther the queen.

<span id="an_7:2">7:2</span> And the king said again to Esther on the
second day at the banquet of wine, What is thy petition, queen Esther?
and it shall be granted thee: and what is thy request? and it shall be
performed, even to the half of the kingdom.

<span id="an_7:3">7:3</span> Then Esther the queen answered and said, If
I have found favor in thy sight, O king, and if it shall please the
king, let my life be given me at my petition, and my people at my
request:

<span id="an_7:4">7:4</span> For we are sold, I and my people, to be
destroyed, to be slain, and to perish. But if we had been sold for
bond-men and bond-women, I had held my tongue, although the enemy could
not countervail the king's damage.

<span id="an_7:5">7:5</span> Then the king Ahasuerus answered and said
to Esther the queen, Who is he, and where is he, that durst presume in
his heart to do so?

<span id="an_7:6">7:6</span> And Esther said, The adversary and enemy is
this wicked Haman. Then Haman was afraid before the king and the queen.

<span id="an_7:7">7:7</span> And the king arising from the banquet of
wine in his wrath went into the palace-garden: and Haman stood up to
make request for his life to Esther the queen; for he saw that there was
evil determined against him by the king.

<span id="an_7:8">7:8</span> Then the king returned out of the
palace-garden into the place of the banquet of wine; and Haman had
fallen upon the bed on which Esther was. Then said the king, Will he
force the queen also before me in the house? As the word went out of the
king's mouth, they covered Haman's face.

<span id="an_7:9">7:9</span> And Harbonah, one of the chamberlains, said
before the king, Behold also, the gallows fifty cubits high, which Haman
had made for Mordecai, who had spoken good for the king, standeth in the
house of Haman. Then the king said, Hang him upon it.

<span id="an_7:10">7:10</span> So they hanged Haman on the gallows that
he had prepared for Mordecai. Then was the king's wrath pacified.

<span id="an_8:1">8:1</span> On that day the king Ahasuerus gave the
house of Haman, the Jews' enemy, to Esther the queen. And Mordecai came
before the king; for Esther had told what he was to her.

<span id="an_8:2">8:2</span> And the king took off his ring which he had
taken from Haman, and gave it to Mordecai. And Esther set Mordecai over
the house of Haman.

<span id="an_8:3">8:3</span> And Esther spoke yet again before the king,
and fell down at his feet, and besought him with tears to put away the
mischief of Haman the Agagite, and his device that he had devised
against the Jews.

<span id="an_8:4">8:4</span> Then the king held out the golden scepter
towards Esther. So Esther arose, and stood before the king,

<span id="an_8:5">8:5</span> And said, If it shall please the king, and
if I have found favor in his sight, and the thing shall seem right
before the king, and I am pleasing in his eyes, let it be written to
reverse the letters devised by Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite,
which he wrote to destroy the Jews who are in all the king's provinces:

<span id="an_8:6">8:6</span> For how can I endure to see the evil that
will come to my people? or how can I endure to see the destruction of my
kindred?

<span id="an_8:7">8:7</span> Then the king Ahasuerus said to Esther the
queen and to Mordecai the Jew, Behold, I have given Esther the house of
Haman, and him they have hanged upon the gallows, because he laid his
hand upon the Jews.

<span id="an_8:8">8:8</span> Write ye also for the Jews, as it pleaseth
you, in the king's name, and seal it with the king's ring: for the
writing which is written in the king's name, and sealed with the king's
ring, no man may reverse.

<span id="an_8:9">8:9</span> Then were the king's scribes called at that
time in the third month, that is, the month Sivan, on the three and
twentieth day of it; and it was written, according to all that Mordecai
commanded, to the Jews, and to the lieutenants, and the deputies and
rulers of the provinces which are from India to Cush, a hundred twenty
and seven provinces, to every province according to the writing of it,
and to every people after their language, and to the Jews according to
their writing, and according to their language.

<span id="an_8:10">8:10</span> And he wrote in the king Ahasuerus's
name, and sealed it with the king's ring, and sent letters by posts on
horseback, and riders on mules, camels, and young dromedaries:

<span id="an_8:11">8:11</span> In which the king granted the Jews who
were in every city to assemble, and to stand for their life, to destroy,
to slay, and to cause to perish, all the power of the people and
province that would assault them, both little ones and women, and to
take the spoil of them for a prey,

<span id="an_8:12">8:12</span> Upon one day in all the provinces of king
Ahasuerus, namely, upon the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which
is the month Adar,

<span id="an_8:13">8:13</span> The copy of the writing for a
commandment, to be given in every province was published to all people,
and that the Jews should be ready against that day to avenge themselves
on their enemies.

<span id="an_8:14">8:14</span> So the posts that rode upon mules and
camels went out, being hastened and pressed on by the king's
commandment. And the decree was given at Shushan the palace.

<span id="an_8:15">8:15</span> And Mordecai went out from the presence
of the king in royal apparel of blue and white, and with a great crown
of gold, and with a garment of fine linen and purple: and the city of
Shushan rejoiced, and was glad:

<span id="an_8:16">8:16</span> The Jews had light, and gladness, and
joy, and honor.

<span id="an_8:17">8:17</span> And in every province, and in every city,
whithersoever the king's commandment and his decree came, the Jews had
joy and gladness, a feast and a good day. And many of the people of the
land became Jews; for the fear of the Jews fell upon them.

<span id="an_9:1">9:1</span> Now in the twelfth month, that is, the
month Adar, on the thirteenth day of the same, when the king's
commandment and his decree drew near to be put in execution, in the day
that the enemies of the Jews hoped to have power over them, (though it
was turned to the contrary, that the Jews had rule over them that hated
them;)

<span id="an_9:2">9:2</span> The Jews assembled in their cities
throughout all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus, to lay hand on such
as sought their hurt: and no man could withstand them; for the fear of
them fell upon all people.

<span id="an_9:3">9:3</span> And all the rulers of the provinces, and
the lieutenants, and the deputies, and officers of the king helped the
Jews; because the fear of Mordecai fell upon them.

<span id="an_9:4">9:4</span> For Mordecai was great in the king's house,
and his fame went out throughout all the provinces: for this man
Mordecai became greater and greater.

<span id="an_9:5">9:5</span> Thus the Jews smote all their enemies with
the stroke of the sword, and slaughter, and destruction, and did what
they would to those that hated them.

<span id="an_9:6">9:6</span> And in Shushan the palace the Jews slew and
destroyed five hundred men.

<span id="an_9:7">9:7</span> And Parshandatha, and Dalphon, and Aspatha,

<span id="an_9:8">9:8</span> And Poratha, and Adalia, and Aridatha,

<span id="an_9:9">9:9</span> And Parmashta, and Arisai, and Aridai, and
Vajezatha,

<span id="an_9:10">9:10</span> The ten sons of Haman the son of
Hammedatha, the enemy of the Jews, they slew; but on the spoil they laid
not their hand.

<span id="an_9:11">9:11</span> On that day the number of those that were
slain in Shushan the palace was brought before the king.

<span id="an_9:12">9:12</span> And the king said to Esther the queen,
the Jews have slain and destroyed five hundred men in Shushan the
palace, and the ten sons of Haman; what have they done in the rest of
the king's provinces? now what is thy petition? and it shall be granted
thee: or what is thy request further? and it shall be done.

<span id="an_9:13">9:13</span> Then said Esther, If it shall please the
king, let it be granted to the Jews who are in Shushan to do to-morrow
also according to this day's decree, and let Haman's ten sons be hanged
upon the gallows.

<span id="an_9:14">9:14</span> And the king commanded it so to be done:
and the decree was given at Shushan; and they hanged Haman's ten sons.

<span id="an_9:15">9:15</span> For the Jews that were in Shushan
assembled on the fourteenth day also of the month Adar, and slew three
hundred men at Shushan; but on the prey they laid not their hand.

<span id="an_9:16">9:16</span> But the other Jews that were in the
king's provinces assembled, and stood for their lives, and had rest from
their enemies, and slew of their foes seventy and five thousand, (but
they laid not their hands on the prey.)

<span id="an_9:17">9:17</span> On the thirteenth day of the month Adar;
and on the fourteenth day of the same they rested, and made it a day of
feasting and gladness.

<span id="an_9:18">9:18</span> But the Jews that were at Shushan
assembled on the thirteenth day of the month, and on the fourteenth of
it: and on the fifteenth day of the same they rested, and made it a day
of feasting and gladness.

<span id="an_9:19">9:19</span> Therefore the Jews of the villages, that
dwelt in the unwalled towns, made the fourteenth day of the month Adar a
day of gladness and feasting, and a good day, and of sending portions
one to another.

<span id="an_9:20">9:20</span> And Mordecai wrote these things, and sent
letters to all the Jews that were in all the provinces of the king
Ahasuerus, both nigh and far,

<span id="an_9:21">9:21</span> To establish this among them, that they
should keep the fourteenth day of the month Adar, and the fifteenth day
of the same, yearly,

<span id="an_9:22">9:22</span> As the days in which the Jews rested from
their enemies, and the month which was turned to them from sorrow to
joy, and from mourning into a good day, that they should make them days
of feasting and joy, and of sending portions one to another, and gifts
to the poor.

<span id="an_9:23">9:23</span> And the Jews undertook to do as they had
begun, and as Mordecai had written to them;

<span id="an_9:24">9:24</span> Because Haman the son of Hammedatha, the
Agagite, the enemy of all the Jews, had devised against the Jews to
destroy them, and had cast Pur, that is, the lot, to consume them, and
to destroy them;

<span id="an_9:25">9:25</span> But when Esther came before the king, he
commanded by letters that his wicked device, which he devised against
the Jews, should return upon his own head, and that he and his sons
should be hanged on the gallows.

<span id="an_9:26">9:26</span> Wherefore they called these days Purim
after the name of Pur. Therefore for all the words of this letter, and
of that which they had seen concerning this matter, and which had come
to them,

<span id="an_9:27">9:27</span> The Jews ordained, and took upon them,
and upon their seed, and upon all such as joined themselves to them, so
as it should not fail, that they would keep these two days according to
their writing, and according to their appointed time every year;

<span id="an_9:28">9:28</span> And that these days should be remembered
and kept throughout every generation, every family, every province, and
every city; and that these days of Purim should not fail from among the
Jews, nor the memorial of them perish from their seed.

<span id="an_9:29">9:29</span> Then Esther the queen, the daughter of
Abihail, and Mordecai the Jew, wrote with all authority, to confirm this
second letter of Purim.

<span id="an_9:30">9:30</span> And he sent the letters to all the Jews,
to the hundred twenty and seven provinces of the kingdom of Ahasuerus,
with words of peace and truth,

<span id="an_9:31">9:31</span> To confirm these days of Purim in their
times appointed, according as Mordecai the Jew and Esther the queen had
enjoined them, and as they had decreed for themselves and for their
seed, the matters of the fastings and their cry.

<span id="an_9:32">9:32</span> And the decree of Esther confirmed these
matters of Purim; and it was written in the book.

<span id="an_10:1">10:1</span> And the king Ahasuerus laid a tribute
upon the land, and upon the isles of the sea.

<span id="an_10:2">10:2</span> And all the acts of his power and of his
might, and the declaration of the greatness of Mordecai, to which the
king advanced him, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of
the kings of Media and Persia?

<span id="an_10:3">10:3</span> For Mordecai the Jew was next to king
Ahasuerus, and great among the Jews, and accepted by the multitude of
his brethren, seeking the wealth of his people, and speaking peace to
all his seed.
