### Webster's Bible: Psalms

<span id="an_1:1">1:1</span> Blessed is the man that walketh not in the
counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth
in the seat of scoffers.

<span id="an_1:2">1:2</span> But his delight is in the law of the LORD;
and in his law doth he meditate day and night.

<span id="an_1:3">1:3</span> And he shall be like a tree planted by the
rivers of water, that bringeth forth its fruit in season; its leaf also
shall not wither; and whatever he doeth shall prosper.

<span id="an_1:4">1:4</span> The ungodly are not so: but are like the
chaff which the wind driveth away.

<span id="an_1:5">1:5</span> Therefore the ungodly shall not stand in
the judgment, nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous.

<span id="an_1:6">1:6</span> For the LORD knoweth the way of the
righteous: but the way of the ungodly shall perish.

<span id="an_2:1">2:1</span> Why do the heathen rage, and the people
imagine a vain thing?

<span id="an_2:2">2:2</span> The kings of the earth set themselves, and
the rulers take counsel together, against the LORD, and against his
anointed, saying,

<span id="an_2:3">2:3</span> Let us break their bands asunder, and cast
away their cords from us.

<span id="an_2:4">2:4</span> He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh:
the Lord shall have them in derision.

<span id="an_2:5">2:5</span> Then shall he speak to them in his wrath,
and trouble them in his sore displeasure.

<span id="an_2:6">2:6</span> Yet have I set my king upon my holy hill of
Zion.

<span id="an_2:7">2:7</span> I will declare the decree: the LORD hath
said to me, Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten thee.

<span id="an_2:8">2:8</span> Ask of me, and I will give thee the heathen
for thy inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy
possession.

<span id="an_2:9">2:9</span> Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron;
thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel.

<span id="an_2:10">2:10</span> Be wise now therefore, O ye kings: be
instructed, ye judges of the earth.

<span id="an_2:11">2:11</span> Serve the LORD with fear, and rejoice
with trembling.

<span id="an_2:12">2:12</span> Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and ye
perish from the way, when his wrath is kindled but a little. Blessed are
all they that put their trust in him.

<span id="an_3:1">3:1</span> A Psalm of David, when he fled from Absalom
his son. LORD, how are they multiplied that trouble me? many are they
that rise up against me.

<span id="an_3:2">3:2</span> Many there are who say of my soul, There is
no help for him in God. Selah.

<span id="an_3:3">3:3</span> But thou, O LORD, art a shield for me; my
glory, and the lifter up of my head.

<span id="an_3:4">3:4</span> I cried to the LORD with my voice, and he
heard me from his holy hill. Selah.

<span id="an_3:5">3:5</span> I laid me down and slept; I awaked; for the
LORD sustained me.

<span id="an_3:6">3:6</span> I will not be afraid of ten thousands of
people, that have set themselves against me on all sides.

<span id="an_3:7">3:7</span> Arise, O LORD; save me, O my God: for thou
hast smitten all my enemies upon the cheek bone; thou hast broken the
teeth of the ungodly.

<span id="an_3:8">3:8</span> Salvation belongeth to the LORD: thy
blessing is upon thy people. Selah.

<span id="an_4:1">4:1</span> To the chief Musician on Neginoth, A Psalm
of David. Hear me when I call, O God of my righteousness: thou hast
enlarged me when I was in distress; have mercy upon me, and hear my
prayer.

<span id="an_4:2">4:2</span> O ye sons of men, how long will ye turn my
glory into shame? how long will ye love vanity, and seek after
falsehood? Selah.

<span id="an_4:3">4:3</span> But know that the LORD hath set apart him
that is godly for himself: the LORD will hear when I call to him.

<span id="an_4:4">4:4</span> Stand in awe, and sin not: commune with
your own heart upon your bed, and be still. Selah.

<span id="an_4:5">4:5</span> Offer the sacrifices of righteousness, and
put your trust in the LORD.

<span id="an_4:6">4:6</span> There are many that say, Who will show us
any good? LORD, lift thou upon us the light of thy countenance.

<span id="an_4:7">4:7</span> Thou hast put gladness in my heart, more
than in the time when their corn and their wine increased.

<span id="an_4:8">4:8</span> I will both lay me down in peace, and
sleep; for thou only, LORD, makest me dwell in safety.

<span id="an_5:1">5:1</span> To the chief Musician upon Nehiloth, A
Psalm of David. Give ear to my words, O LORD, consider my meditation.

<span id="an_5:2">5:2</span> Hearken to the voice of my cry, my King,
and my God: for to thee will I pray.

<span id="an_5:3">5:3</span> My voice shalt thou hear in the morning, O
LORD; in the morning will I direct my prayer to thee, and will look up.

<span id="an_5:4">5:4</span> For thou art not a God that hath pleasure
in wickedness: neither shall evil dwell with thee.

<span id="an_5:5">5:5</span> The foolish shall not stand in thy sight:
thou hatest all workers of iniquity.

<span id="an_5:6">5:6</span> Thou shalt destroy them that speak
falsehood: the LORD will abhor the bloody and deceitful man.

<span id="an_5:7">5:7</span> But as for me, I will come into thy house
in the multitude of thy mercy: and in thy fear will I worship towards
thy holy temple.

<span id="an_5:8">5:8</span> Lead me, O LORD, in thy righteousness,
because of my enemies; make thy way straight before my face.

<span id="an_5:9">5:9</span> For there is no faithfulness in their
mouth; their inward part is very wickedness; their throat is an open
sepulcher; they flatter with their tongue.

<span id="an_5:10">5:10</span> Destroy thou them, O God; let them fall
by their own counsels; cast them out in the multitude of their
transgressions; for they have rebelled against thee.

<span id="an_5:11">5:11</span> But let all those that put their trust in
thee rejoice: let them ever shout for joy, because thou defendest them:
let them also that love thy name be joyful in thee.

<span id="an_5:12">5:12</span> For thou, LORD, wilt bless the righteous;
with favor wilt thou compass him as with a shield.

<span id="an_6:1">6:1</span> To the chief Musician on Neginoth upon
Sheminith, A Psalm of David. O LORD, rebuke me not in thy anger, neither
chasten me in thy hot displeasure.

<span id="an_6:2">6:2</span> Have mercy upon me, O LORD; for I am weak:
O LORD, heal me; for my bones are agitated.

<span id="an_6:3">6:3</span> My soul is also greatly disquieted: but
thou, O LORD, how long?

<span id="an_6:4">6:4</span> Return, O LORD, deliver my soul: Oh save me
for thy mercies sake.

<span id="an_6:5">6:5</span> For in death there is no remembrance of
thee: in the grave who will give thee thanks?

<span id="an_6:6">6:6</span> I am weary with my groaning; all the night
I make my bed to swim; I water my couch with my tears.

<span id="an_6:7">6:7</span> My eye is consumed because of grief; it
groweth old because of all my enemies.

<span id="an_6:8">6:8</span> Depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity;
for the LORD hath heard the voice of my weeping.

<span id="an_6:9">6:9</span> The LORD hath heard my supplication; the
LORD will receive my prayer.

<span id="an_6:10">6:10</span> Let all my enemies be ashamed and greatly
disquieted: let them return and be suddenly ashamed.

<span id="an_7:1">7:1</span> Shiggaion of David, which he sang to the
LORD, concerning the words of Cush the Benjaminite. O LORD my God, in
thee do I put my trust: save me from all them that persecute me, and
deliver me:

<span id="an_7:2">7:2</span> Lest he tear my soul like a lion, rending
it in pieces, while there is none to deliver.

<span id="an_7:3">7:3</span> O LORD my God, if I have done this; if
there is iniquity in my hands;

<span id="an_7:4">7:4</span> If I have rewarded evil to him that was at
peace with me; (yes, I have delivered him that without cause is my
enemy:)

<span id="an_7:5">7:5</span> Let the enemy persecute my soul, and take
it; yes, let him tread down my life upon the earth, and lay my honor in
the dust. Selah.

<span id="an_7:6">7:6</span> Arise, O LORD, in thy anger, lift up
thyself because of the rage of my enemies: and awake for me to the
judgment that thou hast commanded.

<span id="an_7:7">7:7</span> So shall the congregation of the people
encompass thee: for their sakes therefore return thou on high.

<span id="an_7:8">7:8</span> The LORD shall judge the people: judge me,
O LORD, according to my righteousness, and according to my integrity
that is in me.

<span id="an_7:9">7:9</span> Oh let the wickedness of the wicked come to
an end; but establish the just: for the righteous God trieth the hearts
and reins.

<span id="an_7:10">7:10</span> My defense is from God, who saveth the
upright in heart.

<span id="an_7:11">7:11</span> God judgeth the righteous, and God is
angry with the wicked every day.

<span id="an_7:12">7:12</span> If he turn not, he will whet his sword;
he hath bent his bow, and made it ready.

<span id="an_7:13">7:13</span> He hath also prepared for him the
instruments of death; he ordaineth his arrows against the persecutors.

<span id="an_7:14">7:14</span> Behold, he travaileth with iniquity, and
hath conceived mischief, and brought forth falsehood.

<span id="an_7:15">7:15</span> He made a pit, and digged it, and hath
fallen into the ditch which he made.

<span id="an_7:16">7:16</span> His mischief shall return upon his own
head, and his violent dealing shall come down upon his own pate.

<span id="an_7:17">7:17</span> I will praise the LORD according to his
righteousness: and will sing praise to the name of the LORD most high.

<span id="an_8:1">8:1</span> To the chief Musician upon Gittith, A Psalm
of David. O LORD our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth!
who hast set thy glory above the heavens.

<span id="an_8:2">8:2</span> Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings
hast thou ordained strength because of thy enemies, that thou mightest
still the enemy and the avenger.

<span id="an_8:3">8:3</span> When I consider thy heavens, the work of
thy fingers; the moon and the stars, which thou hast ordained;

<span id="an_8:4">8:4</span> What is man, that thou art mindful of him?
and the son of man, that thou visitest him?

<span id="an_8:5">8:5</span> For thou hast made him a little lower than
the angels, and hast crowned him with glory and honor.

<span id="an_8:6">8:6</span> Thou hast made him to have dominion over
the works of thy hands; thou hast put all things under his feet:

<span id="an_8:7">8:7</span> All sheep and oxen, yes, and the beasts of
the field;

<span id="an_8:8">8:8</span> The fowl of the air, and the fish of the
sea, and whatever passeth through the paths of the seas.

<span id="an_8:9">8:9</span> O LORD our Lord, how excellent is thy name
in all the earth!

<span id="an_9:1">9:1</span> To the chief Musician upon Muthlabben, A
Psalm of David. I will praise thee, O LORD, with my whole heart; I will
show forth all thy wonderful works.

<span id="an_9:2">9:2</span> I will be glad and rejoice in thee: I will
sing praise to thy name, O thou most High.

<span id="an_9:3">9:3</span> When my enemies are turned back, they shall
fall and perish at thy presence.

<span id="an_9:4">9:4</span> For thou hast maintained my right and my
cause; thou sattest on the throne judging right.

<span id="an_9:5">9:5</span> Thou hast rebuked the heathen, thou hast
destroyed the wicked, thou hast put out their name for ever and ever.

<span id="an_9:6">9:6</span> O thou enemy, destructions are come to a
perpetual end: and thou hast destroyed cities; their memorial hath
perished with them.

<span id="an_9:7">9:7</span> But the LORD shall endure for ever: he hath
prepared his throne for judgment.

<span id="an_9:8">9:8</span> And he shall judge the world in
righteousness, he shall minister judgment to the people in uprightness.

<span id="an_9:9">9:9</span> The LORD also will be a refuge for the
oppressed, a refuge in times of trouble.

<span id="an_9:10">9:10</span> And they that know thy name will put
their trust in thee: for thou, LORD, hast not forsaken them that seek
thee.

<span id="an_9:11">9:11</span> Sing praises to the LORD, who dwelleth in
Zion: declare among the people his doings.

<span id="an_9:12">9:12</span> When he maketh inquisition for blood, he
remembereth them: he forgetteth not the cry of the humble.

<span id="an_9:13">9:13</span> Have mercy upon me, O LORD; consider my
trouble which I suffer from them that hate me, thou that liftest me up
from the gates of death:

<span id="an_9:14">9:14</span> That I may show forth all thy praise in
the gates of the daughter of Zion: I will rejoice in thy salvation.

<span id="an_9:15">9:15</span> The heathen are sunk down in the pit that
they made: in the net which they hid is their own foot taken.

<span id="an_9:16">9:16</span> The LORD is known by the judgment which
he executeth: the wicked is snared in the work of his own hands.
Higgaion. Selah.

<span id="an_9:17">9:17</span> The wicked shall be turned into hell, and
all the nations that forget God.

<span id="an_9:18">9:18</span> For the needy shall not always be
forgotten: the expectation of the poor shall not perish for ever.

<span id="an_9:19">9:19</span> Arise, O LORD; let not man prevail: let
the heathen be judged in thy sight.

<span id="an_9:20">9:20</span> Put them in fear, O LORD: that the
nations may know themselves to be but men. Selah.

<span id="an_10:1">10:1</span> Why standest thou afar off, O LORD? why
hidest thou thyself in times of trouble?

<span id="an_10:2">10:2</span> The wicked in his pride doth persecute
the poor: let them be taken in the devices that they have imagined.

<span id="an_10:3">10:3</span> For the wicked boasteth of his heart's
desire, and blesseth the covetous, whom the LORD abhorreth.

<span id="an_10:4">10:4</span> The wicked, through the pride of his
countenance, will not seek after God: God is not in all his thoughts.

<span id="an_10:5">10:5</span> His ways are always grievous; thy
judgments are far above out of his sight: as for all his enemies, he
puffeth at them.

<span id="an_10:6">10:6</span> He hath said in his heart, I shall not be
moved: for I shall never be in adversity.

<span id="an_10:7">10:7</span> His mouth is full of cursing and deceit
and fraud: under his tongue is mischief and vanity.

<span id="an_10:8">10:8</span> He sitteth in the lurking places of the
villages: in the secret places doth he murder the innocent: his eyes are
privily set against the poor.

<span id="an_10:9">10:9</span> He lieth in wait secretly as a lion in
his den: he lieth in wait to catch the poor: he doth catch the poor,
when he draweth him into his net.

<span id="an_10:10">10:10</span> He croucheth, and humbleth himself,
that the poor may fall by his strong ones.

<span id="an_10:11">10:11</span> He hath said in his heart, God hath
forgotten: he hideth his face; he will never see it.

<span id="an_10:12">10:12</span> Arise, O LORD; O God, lift up thy hand:
forget not the humble.

<span id="an_10:13">10:13</span> Why doth the wicked contemn God? he
hath said in his heart, Thou wilt not require it.

<span id="an_10:14">10:14</span> Thou hast seen it; for thou beholdest
mischief and spite, to requite it with thy hand: the poor committeth
himself to thee; thou art the helper of the fatherless.

<span id="an_10:15">10:15</span> Break thou the arm of the wicked and
the evil man: seek out his wickedness till thou shalt find none.

<span id="an_10:16">10:16</span> The LORD is King for ever and ever: the
heathen have perished out of his land.

<span id="an_10:17">10:17</span> LORD, thou hast heard the desire of the
humble: thou wilt prepare their heart, thou wilt cause thy ear to hear:

<span id="an_10:18">10:18</span> To judge the fatherless and the
oppressed, that the man of the earth may no more oppress.

<span id="an_11:1">11:1</span> To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David.
In the LORD I put my trust: how say ye to my soul, Flee as a bird to
your mountain?

<span id="an_11:2">11:2</span> For lo, the wicked bend their bow, they
make ready their arrow upon the string, that they may privily shoot at
the upright in heart.

<span id="an_11:3">11:3</span> If the foundations be destroyed, what can
the righteous do?

<span id="an_11:4">11:4</span> The LORD is in his holy temple, the
LORD'S throne is in heaven: his eyes behold, his eyelids try the
children of men.

<span id="an_11:5">11:5</span> The LORD trieth the righteous: but the
wicked and him that loveth violence his soul hateth.

<span id="an_11:6">11:6</span> Upon the wicked he shall rain snares,
fire and brimstone, and a horrible tempest: this shall be the portion of
their cup.

<span id="an_11:7">11:7</span> For the righteous LORD loveth
righteousness; his countenance beholdeth the upright.

<span id="an_12:1">12:1</span> To the chief Musician upon Sheminith. A
Psalm of David. Help, LORD; for the godly man ceaseth; for the faithful
fail from among the children of men.

<span id="an_12:2">12:2</span> They speak vanity every one with his
neighbor: with flattering lips and with a double heart do they speak.

<span id="an_12:3">12:3</span> The LORD shall cut off all flattering
lips, and the tongue that speaketh proud things:

<span id="an_12:4">12:4</span> Who have said, With our tongue will we
prevail; our lips are our own: who is lord over us?

<span id="an_12:5">12:5</span> For the oppression of the poor, for the
sighing of the needy, now will I arise, saith the LORD; I will set him
in safety from him that puffeth at him.

<span id="an_12:6">12:6</span> The words of the LORD are pure words: as
silver tried in a furnace of earth, purified seven times.

<span id="an_12:7">12:7</span> Thou shalt keep them, O LORD, thou shalt
preserve them from this generation for ever.

<span id="an_12:8">12:8</span> The wicked walk on every side, when the
vilest men are exalted.

<span id="an_13:1">13:1</span> To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David.
How long wilt thou forget me, O LORD? for ever? how long wilt thou hide
thy face from me?

<span id="an_13:2">13:2</span> How long shall I take counsel in my soul,
having sorrow in my heart daily? how long shall my enemy be exalted over
me?

<span id="an_13:3">13:3</span> Consider and hear me, O LORD my God:
lighten my eyes, lest I sleep the sleep of death;

<span id="an_13:4">13:4</span> Lest my enemy say, I have prevailed
against him; and those that trouble me rejoice when I am moved.

<span id="an_13:5">13:5</span> But I have trusted in thy mercy; my heart
shall rejoice in thy salvation.

<span id="an_13:6">13:6</span> I will sing to the LORD, because he hath
dealt bountifully with me.

<span id="an_14:1">14:1</span> To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David.
The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God. They are corrupt, they
have done abominable works, there is none that doeth good.

<span id="an_14:2">14:2</span> The LORD looked down from heaven upon the
children of men, to see if there were any that did understand, and seek
God.

<span id="an_14:3">14:3</span> They are all gone aside, they are all
together become filthy: there is none that doeth good, no, not one.

<span id="an_14:4">14:4</span> Have all the workers of iniquity no
knowledge? who eat up my people as they eat bread, and call not upon the
LORD.

<span id="an_14:5">14:5</span> There were they in great fear: for God is
in the generation of the righteous.

<span id="an_14:6">14:6</span> Ye have shamed the counsel of the poor,
because the LORD is his refuge.

<span id="an_14:7">14:7</span> Oh that the salvation of Israel were come
out of Zion! when the LORD bringeth back the captivity of his people,
Jacob shall rejoice, and Israel shall be glad.

<span id="an_15:1">15:1</span> A Psalm of David. LORD, who shall abide
in thy tabernacle? who shall dwell in thy holy hill?

<span id="an_15:2">15:2</span> He that walketh uprightly, and worketh
righteousness, and speaketh the truth in his heart.

<span id="an_15:3">15:3</span> He that backbiteth not with his tongue,
nor doeth evil to his neighbor, nor taketh up a reproach against his
neighbor.

<span id="an_15:4">15:4</span> In whose eyes a vile person is contemned;
but he honoreth them that fear the LORD. He that sweareth to his own
hurt, and changeth not.

<span id="an_15:5">15:5</span> He that putteth not out his money to
usury, nor taketh reward against the innocent. He that doeth these
things shall never be moved.

<span id="an_16:1">16:1</span> Michtam of David. Preserve me, O God: for
in thee do I put my trust.

<span id="an_16:2">16:2</span> O my soul, thou hast said to the LORD,
Thou art my Lord: my goodness extendeth not to thee;

<span id="an_16:3">16:3</span> But to the saints that are in the earth,
and to the excellent, in whom is all my delight.

<span id="an_16:4">16:4</span> Their sorrows shall be multiplied that
hasten after another god: their drink-offerings of blood will I not
offer, nor take their names into my lips.

<span id="an_16:5">16:5</span> The LORD is the portion of my inheritance
and of my cup: thou maintainest my lot.

<span id="an_16:6">16:6</span> The lines have fallen to me in pleasant
places; yes, I have a goodly heritage.

<span id="an_16:7">16:7</span> I will bless the LORD, who hath given me
counsel: my reins also instruct me in the night season.

<span id="an_16:8">16:8</span> I have set the LORD always before me:
because he is at my right hand, I shall not be moved.

<span id="an_16:9">16:9</span> Therefore my heart is glad, and my glory
rejoiceth: my flesh also shall rest in hope.

<span id="an_16:10">16:10</span> For thou wilt not leave my soul in
hell; neither wilt thou suffer thy Holy One to see corruption.

<span id="an_16:11">16:11</span> Thou wilt show me the path of life: in
thy presence is fullness of joy; at thy right hand are pleasures for
evermore.

<span id="an_17:1">17:1</span> A Prayer of David. Hear the right, O
LORD, attend to my cry, give ear to my prayer, that goeth not out of
feigned lips.

<span id="an_17:2">17:2</span> Let my sentence come forth from thy
presence; let thy eyes behold the things that are equal.

<span id="an_17:3">17:3</span> Thou hast proved my heart; thou hast
visited me in the night; thou hast tried me, and shalt find nothing; I
have purposed that my mouth shall not transgress.

<span id="an_17:4">17:4</span> Concerning the works of men, by the word
of thy lips I have kept me from the paths of the destroyer.

<span id="an_17:5">17:5</span> Uphold my goings in thy paths, that my
footsteps slip not.

<span id="an_17:6">17:6</span> I have called upon thee, for thou wilt
hear me, O God: incline thy ear to me, and hear my speech.

<span id="an_17:7">17:7</span> Show thy wonderful loving-kindness, O
thou that savest by thy right hand them who put their trust in thee from
those that rise up against them.

<span id="an_17:8">17:8</span> Keep me as the apple of the eye, hide me
under the shade of thy wings.

<span id="an_17:9">17:9</span> From the wicked that oppress me, from my
deadly enemies, who encompass me,

<span id="an_17:10">17:10</span> They are inclosed in their own fat:
with their mouth they speak proudly.

<span id="an_17:11">17:11</span> They have now compassed us in our
steps: they have set their eyes bowing down to the earth;

<span id="an_17:12">17:12</span> Like as a lion that is greedy of his
prey, and as it were a young lion lurking in secret places.

<span id="an_17:13">17:13</span> Arise, O LORD disappoint him, cast him
down: deliver my soul from the wicked, who is thy sword:

<span id="an_17:14">17:14</span> From men who are thy hand, O LORD, from
men of the world, who have their portion in this life, and whose belly
thou fillest with thy hid treasure: they are full of children, and leave
the rest of their substance to their babes.

<span id="an_17:15">17:15</span> As for me, I shall behold thy face in
righteousness: I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with thy likeness.

<span id="an_18:1">18:1</span> To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David,
the servant of the LORD, who spoke to the LORD the words of this song in
the day that the LORD delivered him from the hand of all his enemies,
and from the hand of Saul: And he said, I will love thee, O LORD, my
strength.

<span id="an_18:2">18:2</span> The LORD is my rock, and my fortress, and
my deliverer; my God, my strength, in whom I will trust; my buckler, and
the horn of my salvation, and my high tower.

<span id="an_18:3">18:3</span> I will call upon the LORD, who is worthy
to be praised: so shall I be saved from my enemies.

<span id="an_18:4">18:4</span> The sorrows of death compassed me, and
the floods of ungodly men made me afraid.

<span id="an_18:5">18:5</span> The sorrows of hell encompassed me: the
snares of death seized me.

<span id="an_18:6">18:6</span> In my distress I called upon the LORD,
and cried to my God: he heard my voice out of his temple, and my cry
came before him, even into his ears.

<span id="an_18:7">18:7</span> Then the earth shook and trembled; the
foundations also of the hills moved and were shaken, because he was
wroth.

<span id="an_18:8">18:8</span> There went up a smoke out of his
nostrils, and fire out of his mouth devoured: coals were kindled by it.

<span id="an_18:9">18:9</span> He bowed the heavens also, and came down:
and darkness was under his feet.

<span id="an_18:10">18:10</span> And he rode upon a cherub, and flew;
yes, he flew upon the wings of the wind.

<span id="an_18:11">18:11</span> He made darkness his secret place; his
pavilion around him were dark waters and thick clouds of the skies.

<span id="an_18:12">18:12</span> At the brightness that was before him
his thick clouds passed, hail stones and coals of fire.

<span id="an_18:13">18:13</span> The LORD also thundered in the heavens,
and the Highest gave his voice; hail stones and coals of fire.

<span id="an_18:14">18:14</span> Yes, he sent out his arrows, and
scattered them; and he shot out lightnings, and discomfited them.

<span id="an_18:15">18:15</span> Then the channels of waters were seen,
and the foundations of the world were uncovered at thy rebuke, O LORD,
at the blast of the breath of thy nostrils.

<span id="an_18:16">18:16</span> He sent from above, he took me, he drew
me out of many waters.

<span id="an_18:17">18:17</span> He delivered me from my strong enemy,
and from them who hated me: for they were too strong for me.

<span id="an_18:18">18:18</span> They attacked me in the day of my
calamity: but the LORD was my stay.

<span id="an_18:19">18:19</span> He brought me forth also in a large
place; he delivered me, because he delighted in me.

<span id="an_18:20">18:20</span> The LORD rewarded me according to my
righteousness; according to the cleanness of my hands hath he
recompensed me.

<span id="an_18:21">18:21</span> For I have kept the ways of the LORD,
and have not wickedly departed from my God.

<span id="an_18:22">18:22</span> For all his judgments were before me,
and I did not put away his statutes from me.

<span id="an_18:23">18:23</span> I was also upright before him, and I
kept myself from my iniquity.

<span id="an_18:24">18:24</span> Therefore hath the LORD recompensed me
according to my righteousness, according to the cleanness of my hands in
his sight.

<span id="an_18:25">18:25</span> With the merciful thou wilt show
thyself merciful; with an upright man thou wilt show thyself upright;

<span id="an_18:26">18:26</span> With the pure thou wilt show thyself
pure; and with the froward thou wilt contend.

<span id="an_18:27">18:27</span> For thou wilt save the afflicted
people; but wilt bring down high looks.

<span id="an_18:28">18:28</span> For thou wilt light my candle: the LORD
my God will enlighten my darkness.

<span id="an_18:29">18:29</span> For by thee I have run through a troop;
and by my God have I leaped over a wall.

<span id="an_18:30">18:30</span> As for God, his way is perfect: the
word of the LORD is tried: he is a buckler to all those that trust in
him.

<span id="an_18:31">18:31</span> For who is God save the LORD? or who is
a rock save our God?

<span id="an_18:32">18:32</span> It is God that girdeth me with
strength, and maketh my way perfect.

<span id="an_18:33">18:33</span> He maketh my feet like hinds' feet, and
setteth me upon my high places.

<span id="an_18:34">18:34</span> He teacheth my hands to war, so that a
bow of steel is broken by my arms.

<span id="an_18:35">18:35</span> Thou hast also given me the shield of
thy salvation: and thy right hand hath held me up and thy gentleness
hath made me great.

<span id="an_18:36">18:36</span> Thou hast enlarged my steps under me,
that my feet did not slip.

<span id="an_18:37">18:37</span> I have pursued my enemies, and
overtaken them: neither did I turn again till they were consumed.

<span id="an_18:38">18:38</span> I have wounded them that they were not
able to rise: they have fallen under my feet.

<span id="an_18:39">18:39</span> For thou hast girded me with strength
to battle: thou hast subdued under me those that rose up against me.

<span id="an_18:40">18:40</span> Thou hast also given me the necks of my
enemies; that I might destroy them that hate me.

<span id="an_18:41">18:41</span> They cried, but there was none to save
them: even to the LORD, but he answered them not.

<span id="an_18:42">18:42</span> Then I beat them small as the dust
before the wind: I cast them out as the dirt in the streets.

<span id="an_18:43">18:43</span> Thou hast delivered me from the
strivings of the people; and thou hast made me the head of the heathen:
a people whom I have not known shall serve me.

<span id="an_18:44">18:44</span> As soon as they hear of me, they shall
obey me: the strangers shall submit themselves to me.

<span id="an_18:45">18:45</span> The strangers shall fade away, and be
afraid from their close places.

<span id="an_18:46">18:46</span> The LORD liveth; and blessed be my
rock; and let the God of my salvation be exalted.

<span id="an_18:47">18:47</span> It is God that avengeth me, and
subdueth the people under me.

<span id="an_18:48">18:48</span> He delivereth me from my enemies: yes,
thou liftest me up above those that rise up against me: thou hast
delivered me from the violent man.

<span id="an_18:49">18:49</span> Therefore will I give thanks to thee, O
LORD, among the heathen, and sing praises to thy name.

<span id="an_18:50">18:50</span> He giveth great deliverance to his
king; and showeth mercy to his anointed, to David, and to his seed for
ever.

<span id="an_19:1">19:1</span> To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David.
The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament showeth the work
of his hands.

<span id="an_19:2">19:2</span> Day to day uttereth speech, and night to
night showeth knowledge.

<span id="an_19:3">19:3</span> There is no speech nor language, where
their voice is not heard.

<span id="an_19:4">19:4</span> Their line hath gone out through all the
earth, and their words to the end of the world. In them hath he set a
tabernacle for the sun,

<span id="an_19:5">19:5</span> Which is as a bridegroom coming out of
his chamber, and rejoiceth as a strong man to run a race.

<span id="an_19:6">19:6</span> His going forth is from the end of the
heaven, and his circuit to the ends of it: and there is nothing hid from
his heat.

<span id="an_19:7">19:7</span> The law of the LORD is perfect,
converting the soul: the testimony of the LORD is sure, making wise the
simple.

<span id="an_19:8">19:8</span> The statutes of the LORD are right,
rejoicing the heart: the commandment of the LORD is pure, enlightening
the eyes.

<span id="an_19:9">19:9</span> The fear of the LORD is clean, enduring
for ever: the judgments of the LORD are true and righteous altogether.

<span id="an_19:10">19:10</span> More to be desired are they than gold,
yes, than much fine gold: sweeter also than honey and the honey-comb.

<span id="an_19:11">19:11</span> Moreover, by them is thy servant
warned: and in keeping of them there is great reward.

<span id="an_19:12">19:12</span> Who can understand his errors? cleanse
thou me from secret faults.

<span id="an_19:13">19:13</span> Keep back thy servant also from
presumptuous sins; let them not have dominion over me: then shall I be
upright, and I shall be innocent from the great transgression.

<span id="an_19:14">19:14</span> Let the words of my mouth, and the
meditation of my heart, be acceptable in thy sight, O LORD, my strength,
and my redeemer.

<span id="an_20:1">20:1</span> To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David.
The LORD hear thee in the day of trouble; the name of the God of Jacob
defend thee.

<span id="an_20:2">20:2</span> Send thee help from the sanctuary, and
strengthen thee out of Zion.

<span id="an_20:3">20:3</span> Remember all thy offerings, and accept
thy burnt-sacrifice. Selah.

<span id="an_20:4">20:4</span> Grant thee according to thy own heart,
and fulfill all thy counsel.

<span id="an_20:5">20:5</span> We will rejoice in thy salvation, and in
the name of our God we will set up our banners: the LORD fulfill all thy
petitions.

<span id="an_20:6">20:6</span> Now I know that the LORD saveth his
anointed; he will hear him from his holy heaven with the saving strength
of his right hand.

<span id="an_20:7">20:7</span> Some trust in chariots, and some in
horses: but we will remember the name of the LORD our God.

<span id="an_20:8">20:8</span> They are brought down and fallen: but we
are raised, and stand upright.

<span id="an_20:9">20:9</span> Save, LORD: let the king hear us when we
call.

<span id="an_21:1">21:1</span> To the chief Musician, a Psalm of David.
The king shall joy in thy strength, O LORD; and in thy salvation how
greatly shall he rejoice!

<span id="an_21:2">21:2</span> Thou hast given him his heart's desire,
and hast not withheld the request of his lips. Selah.

<span id="an_21:3">21:3</span> For thou hast met him with the blessings
of goodness: thou hast set a crown of pure gold on his head.

<span id="an_21:4">21:4</span> He asked life of thee, and thou gavest it
to him, even length of days for ever and ever.

<span id="an_21:5">21:5</span> His glory is great in thy salvation:
honor and majesty hast thou laid upon him.

<span id="an_21:6">21:6</span> For thou hast made him most blessed for
ever: thou hast made him exceeding glad with thy countenance.

<span id="an_21:7">21:7</span> For the king trusteth in the LORD, and
through the mercy of the most High he shall not be moved.

<span id="an_21:8">21:8</span> Thy hand shall find out all thy enemies:
thy right hand shall find out those that hate thee.

<span id="an_21:9">21:9</span> Thou shalt make them as a fiery oven in
the time of thy anger: the LORD shall swallow them up in his wrath, and
the fire shall devour them.

<span id="an_21:10">21:10</span> Their fruit shalt thou destroy from the
earth, and their seed from among the children of men.

<span id="an_21:11">21:11</span> For they intended evil against thee:
they imagined a mischievous device, which they are not able to perform.

<span id="an_21:12">21:12</span> Therefore shalt thou make them turn
their back, when thou shalt make ready thy arrows upon thy strings
against the face of them.

<span id="an_21:13">21:13</span> Be thou exalted, LORD, in thy own
strength: so will we sing and praise thy power.

<span id="an_22:1">22:1</span> To the chief Musician upon Aijeleth
Shahar, A Psalm of David. My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? why
art thou so far from helping me, and from the words of my roaring?

<span id="an_22:2">22:2</span> O my God, I cry in the day-time, but thou
hearest not; and in the night season, and am not silent.

<span id="an_22:3">22:3</span> But thou art holy, O thou that inhabitest
the praises of Israel.

<span id="an_22:4">22:4</span> Our fathers trusted in thee: they
trusted, and thou didst deliver them.

<span id="an_22:5">22:5</span> They cried to thee, and were delivered:
they trusted in thee, and were not confounded.

<span id="an_22:6">22:6</span> But I am a worm, and no man; a reproach
of men, and despised by the people.

<span id="an_22:7">22:7</span> All they that see me deride me: they
shoot out the lip, they shake the head, saying,

<span id="an_22:8">22:8</span> He trusted on the LORD that he would
deliver him: let him deliver him, seeing he delighted in him.

<span id="an_22:9">22:9</span> But thou art he that brought me forth
into life: thou didst make me hope when I was upon my mother's breasts.

<span id="an_22:10">22:10</span> I was cast upon thee from my birth:
thou art my God from the time I was born.

<span id="an_22:11">22:11</span> Be not far from me; for trouble is
near; for there is none to help.

<span id="an_22:12">22:12</span> Many bulls have compassed me: strong
bulls of Bashan have beset me round.

<span id="an_22:13">22:13</span> They gaped upon me with their mouths,
as a ravening and a roaring lion.

<span id="an_22:14">22:14</span> I am poured out like water, and all my
bones are out of joint: my heart is like wax; it is melted in the midst
of my bowels.

<span id="an_22:15">22:15</span> My strength is dried up like a
potsherd; and my tongue cleaveth to my jaws; and thou hast brought me
into the dust of death.

<span id="an_22:16">22:16</span> For dogs have compassed me: the
assembly of the wicked have inclosed me: they pierced my hands and my
feet.

<span id="an_22:17">22:17</span> I may number all my bones: they look
and stare upon me.

<span id="an_22:18">22:18</span> They part my garments among them, and
cast lots upon my vesture.

<span id="an_22:19">22:19</span> But be not thou far from me, O LORD: O
my strength, haste thee to help me.

<span id="an_22:20">22:20</span> Deliver my soul from the sword; my
darling from the power of the dog.

<span id="an_22:21">22:21</span> Save me from the lion's mouth: for thou
hast heard me from the horns of the unicorns.

<span id="an_22:22">22:22</span> I will declare thy name to my brethren:
in the midst of the congregation will I praise thee.

<span id="an_22:23">22:23</span> Ye that fear the LORD, praise him; all
ye the seed of Jacob, glorify him; and fear him, all ye the seed of
Israel.

<span id="an_22:24">22:24</span> For he hath not despised nor abhorred
the affliction of the afflicted; neither hath he hid his face from him;
but when he cried to him, he heard.

<span id="an_22:25">22:25</span> My praise shall be of thee in the great
congregation: I will pay my vows before them that fear him.

<span id="an_22:26">22:26</span> The meek shall eat and be satisfied:
they shall praise the LORD that seek him: your heart shall live for
ever.

<span id="an_22:27">22:27</span> All the ends of the world shall
remember and turn to the LORD: and all the kindreds of the nations shall
worship before thee.

<span id="an_22:28">22:28</span> For the kingdom is the LORD'S: and he
is the governor among the nations.

<span id="an_22:29">22:29</span> All they that are fat upon earth shall
eat and worship: all they that go down to the dust shall bow before him:
and none can keep alive his own soul.

<span id="an_22:30">22:30</span> A seed shall serve him; it shall be
accounted to the Lord for a generation.

<span id="an_22:31">22:31</span> They shall come, and shall declare his
righteousness to a people that shall be born, that he hath done this.

<span id="an_23:1">23:1</span> A Psalm of David. The LORD is my
shepherd; I shall not want.

<span id="an_23:2">23:2</span> He maketh me to lie down in green
pastures: he leadeth me beside the still waters.

<span id="an_23:3">23:3</span> He restoreth my soul: he leadeth me in
the paths of righteousness for his name's sake.

<span id="an_23:4">23:4</span> Yes, though I walk through the valley of
the shades of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod
and thy staff they comfort me.

<span id="an_23:5">23:5</span> Thou preparest a table before me in the
presence of my enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth
over.

<span id="an_23:6">23:6</span> Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me
all the days of my life: and I will dwell in the house of the LORD for
ever.

<span id="an_24:1">24:1</span> A Psalm of David. The earth is the
LORD'S, and the fullness thereof; the world, and they that dwell
therein.

<span id="an_24:2">24:2</span> For he hath founded it upon the seas, and
established it upon the floods.

<span id="an_24:3">24:3</span> Who shall ascend upon the hill of the
LORD? and who shall stand in his holy place?

<span id="an_24:4">24:4</span> He that hath clean hands, and a pure
heart; who hath not lifted up his soul to vanity, nor sworn deceitfully.

<span id="an_24:5">24:5</span> He shall receive the blessing from the
LORD, and righteousness from the God of his salvation.

<span id="an_24:6">24:6</span> This is the generation of them that seek
him, that seek thy face, O Jacob. Selah.

<span id="an_24:7">24:7</span> Lift up your heads, O ye gates; and be ye
lifted up, ye everlasting doors; and the King of glory shall come in.

<span id="an_24:8">24:8</span> Who is this King of glory? the LORD
strong and mighty, the LORD mighty in battle.

<span id="an_24:9">24:9</span> Lift up your heads, O ye gates; even lift
them up, ye everlasting doors; and the King of glory shall come in.

<span id="an_24:10">24:10</span> Who is this King of glory? the LORD of
hosts, he is the King of glory. Selah.

<span id="an_25:1">25:1</span> A Psalm of David. To thee, O LORD, do I
lift up my soul.

<span id="an_25:2">25:2</span> O my God, I trust in thee: let me not be
ashamed, let not my enemies triumph over me,

<span id="an_25:3">25:3</span> Also, let none that wait on thee be
ashamed: let them be ashamed who transgress without cause.

<span id="an_25:4">25:4</span> Show me thy ways, O LORD; teach me thy
paths.

<span id="an_25:5">25:5</span> Lead me in thy truth, and teach me: for
thou art the God of my salvation; on thee do I wait all the day.

<span id="an_25:6">25:6</span> Remember, O LORD, thy tender mercies and
thy loving kindnesses; for they have been ever of old.

<span id="an_25:7">25:7</span> Remember not the sins of my youth, nor my
transgressions: according to thy mercy remember thou me for thy
goodness' sake, O LORD.

<span id="an_25:8">25:8</span> Good and upright is the LORD: therefore
will he teach sinners in the way.

<span id="an_25:9">25:9</span> The meek will he guide in judgment: and
the meek will he teach his way.

<span id="an_25:10">25:10</span> All the paths of the LORD are mercy and
truth to such as keep his covenant and his testimonies.

<span id="an_25:11">25:11</span> For thy name's sake, O LORD, pardon my
iniquity; for it is great.

<span id="an_25:12">25:12</span> What man is he that feareth the LORD?
him shall he teach in the way that he shall choose.

<span id="an_25:13">25:13</span> His soul shall dwell at ease; and his
seed shall inherit the earth.

<span id="an_25:14">25:14</span> The secret of the LORD is with them
that fear him; and he will show them his covenant.

<span id="an_25:15">25:15</span> My eyes are ever towards the LORD; for
he will pluck my feet out of the net.

<span id="an_25:16">25:16</span> Turn thee to me, and have mercy upon
me; for I am desolate and afflicted.

<span id="an_25:17">25:17</span> The troubles of my heart are enlarged:
O bring thou me out of my distresses.

<span id="an_25:18">25:18</span> Look upon my affliction and my pain;
and forgive all my sins.

<span id="an_25:19">25:19</span> Consider my enemies, for they are many;
and they hate me with cruel hatred.

<span id="an_25:20">25:20</span> O keep my soul, and deliver me: let me
not be ashamed; for I put my trust in thee.

<span id="an_25:21">25:21</span> Let integrity and uprightness preserve
me; for I wait on thee.

<span id="an_25:22">25:22</span> Redeem Israel, O God, out of all his
troubles.

<span id="an_26:1">26:1</span> A Psalm of David. Judge me, O LORD; for I
have walked in my integrity: I have trusted also in the LORD; therefore
I shall not slide.

<span id="an_26:2">26:2</span> Examine me, O LORD, and prove me; try my
reins and my heart.

<span id="an_26:3">26:3</span> For thy loving-kindness is before my
eyes: and I have walked in thy truth.

<span id="an_26:4">26:4</span> I have not sat with vain persons, neither
will I go in with dissemblers.

<span id="an_26:5">26:5</span> I have hated the congregation of evil
doers; and will not sit with the wicked.

<span id="an_26:6">26:6</span> I will wash my hands in innocence: so
will I compass thy altar, O LORD:

<span id="an_26:7">26:7</span> That I may publish with the voice of
thanksgiving, and tell of all thy wondrous works.

<span id="an_26:8">26:8</span> LORD, I have loved the habitation of thy
house, and the place where thy honor dwelleth.

<span id="an_26:9">26:9</span> Gather not my soul with sinners, nor my
life with bloody men:

<span id="an_26:10">26:10</span> In whose hands is mischief, and their
right hand is full of bribes.

<span id="an_26:11">26:11</span> But as for me, I will walk in my
integrity: redeem me, and be merciful to me.

<span id="an_26:12">26:12</span> My foot standeth in an even place: in
the congregations will I bless the LORD.

<span id="an_27:1">27:1</span> A Psalm of David. The LORD is my light
and my salvation; whom shall I fear? the LORD is the strength of my
life; of whom shall I be afraid?

<span id="an_27:2">27:2</span> When the wicked, even my enemies and my
foes, came upon me to eat up my flesh, they stumbled and fell.

<span id="an_27:3">27:3</span> Though a host should encamp against me,
my heart shall not fear: though war should rise against me, in this will
I be confident.

<span id="an_27:4">27:4</span> One thing have I desired of the LORD,
that will I seek after; that I may dwell in the house of the LORD all
the days of my life, to behold the beauty of the LORD, and to inquire in
his temple.

<span id="an_27:5">27:5</span> For in the time of trouble he will hide
me in his pavilion: in the secret of his tabernacle will he hide me; he
will set me up upon a rock.

<span id="an_27:6">27:6</span> And now shall my head be lifted above my
enemies around me: therefore will I offer in his tabernacle sacrifices
of joy; I will sing, yes, I will sing praises to the LORD.

<span id="an_27:7">27:7</span> Hear, O LORD, when I cry with my voice:
have mercy also upon me, and answer me.

<span id="an_27:8">27:8</span> When thou saidst, Seek ye my face; my
heart said to thee, Thy face, LORD, will I seek.

<span id="an_27:9">27:9</span> Hide not thy face from me; put not thy
servant away in anger: thou hast been my help; leave me not, neither
forsake me, O God of my salvation.

<span id="an_27:10">27:10</span> When my father and my mother forsake
me, then the LORD will take me up.

<span id="an_27:11">27:11</span> Teach me thy way, O LORD, and lead me
in a plain path, because of my enemies.

<span id="an_27:12">27:12</span> Deliver me not over to the will of my
enemies: for false witnesses have risen against me, and such as breathe
out cruelty.

<span id="an_27:13">27:13</span> I had fainted, unless I had believed to
see the goodness of the LORD in the land of the living.

<span id="an_27:14">27:14</span> Wait on the LORD: be of good courage,
and he will strengthen thy heart: wait, I say, on the LORD.

<span id="an_28:1">28:1</span> A Psalm of David. To thee will I cry, O
LORD my rock; be not silent to me: lest, if thou shouldst be silent to
me, I should become like them that go down into the pit.

<span id="an_28:2">28:2</span> Hear the voice of my supplications, when
I cry to thee, when I lift my hands towards thy holy oracle.

<span id="an_28:3">28:3</span> Draw me not away with the wicked, and
with the workers of iniquity, who speak peace to their neighbors, but
mischief is in their hearts.

<span id="an_28:4">28:4</span> Give them according to their deeds, and
according to the wickedness of their endeavors: give them after the work
of their hands; render to them their desert.

<span id="an_28:5">28:5</span> Because they regard not the works of the
LORD, nor the operation of his hands, he will destroy them, and not
build them up.

<span id="an_28:6">28:6</span> Blessed be the LORD, because he hath
heard the voice of my supplications.

<span id="an_28:7">28:7</span> The LORD is my strength, and my shield;
my heart trusted in him, and I am helped: therefore my heart greatly
rejoiceth; and with my song will I praise him.

<span id="an_28:8">28:8</span> The LORD is their strength, and he is the
saving strength of his anointed.

<span id="an_28:9">28:9</span> Save thy people, and bless thy
inheritance: feed them also, and lift them up for ever.

<span id="an_29:1">29:1</span> A Psalm of David. Give to the LORD, O ye
mighty, give to the LORD glory and strength.

<span id="an_29:2">29:2</span> Give to the LORD, the glory due to his
name; worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness.

<span id="an_29:3">29:3</span> The voice of the LORD is upon the waters:
the God of glory thundereth: the LORD is upon many waters.

<span id="an_29:4">29:4</span> The voice of the LORD is powerful; the
voice of the LORD is full of majesty.

<span id="an_29:5">29:5</span> The voice of the LORD breaketh the
cedars; yes, the LORD breaketh the cedars of Lebanon.

<span id="an_29:6">29:6</span> He maketh them also to skip like a calf;
Lebanon and Sirion like a young unicorn.

<span id="an_29:7">29:7</span> The voice of the LORD divideth the flames
of fire.

<span id="an_29:8">29:8</span> The voice of the LORD shaketh the
wilderness; the LORD shaketh the wilderness of Kadesh.

<span id="an_29:9">29:9</span> The voice of the LORD maketh the hinds to
calve, and maketh bare the forests: and in his temple doth every one
speak of his glory.

<span id="an_29:10">29:10</span> The LORD sitteth upon the flood; yes,
the LORD sitteth king for ever.

<span id="an_29:11">29:11</span> The LORD will give strength to his
people; the LORD will bless his people with peace.

<span id="an_30:1">30:1</span> A Psalm and Song, at the dedication of
the house of David. I will extol thee, O LORD; for thou hast lifted me
up, and hast not made my foes to rejoice over me.

<span id="an_30:2">30:2</span> O LORD my God, I cried to thee, and thou
hast healed me.

<span id="an_30:3">30:3</span> O LORD, thou hast brought up my soul from
the grave: thou hast kept me alive, that I should not go down to the
pit.

<span id="an_30:4">30:4</span> Sing to the LORD, O ye saints of his, and
give thanks at the remembrance of his holiness.

<span id="an_30:5">30:5</span> For his anger endureth but a moment; in
his favor is life: weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the
morning.

<span id="an_30:6">30:6</span> And in my prosperity I said, I shall
never be moved.

<span id="an_30:7">30:7</span> LORD, by thy favor thou hast made my
mountain to stand strong: thou didst hide thy face, and I was troubled.

<span id="an_30:8">30:8</span> I cried to thee, O LORD; and to the LORD
I made supplication.

<span id="an_30:9">30:9</span> What profit is there in my blood, when I
go down to the pit? Shall the dust praise thee? shall it declare thy
truth?

<span id="an_30:10">30:10</span> Hear, O LORD, and have mercy upon me:
LORD, be thou my helper.

<span id="an_30:11">30:11</span> Thou hast turned for me my mourning
into dancing: thou hast put off my sackcloth, and girded me with
gladness;

<span id="an_30:12">30:12</span> To the end that my glory may sing
praise to thee, and not be silent. O LORD my God, I will give thanks to
thee for ever.

<span id="an_31:1">31:1</span> To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David.
In thee, O LORD, do I put my trust; let me never be ashamed: deliver me
in thy righteousness.

<span id="an_31:2">31:2</span> Bow down thy ear to me; deliver me
speedily: be thou my strong rock, for a house of defense to save me.

<span id="an_31:3">31:3</span> For thou art my rock and my fortress;
therefore for thy name's sake lead me, and guide me.

<span id="an_31:4">31:4</span> Pull me out of the net that they have
laid privily for me: for thou art my strength.

<span id="an_31:5">31:5</span> Into thy hand I commit my spirit: thou
hast redeemed me, O LORD God of truth.

<span id="an_31:6">31:6</span> I have hated them that regard lying
vanities: but I trust in the LORD.

<span id="an_31:7">31:7</span> I will be glad and rejoice in thy mercy:
for thou hast considered my trouble; thou hast known my soul in
adversities;

<span id="an_31:8">31:8</span> And hast not shut me up into the hand of
the enemy: thou hast set my foot in a large room.

<span id="an_31:9">31:9</span> Have mercy upon me, O LORD, for I am in
trouble: my eye is consumed with grief, yes, my soul and my belly.

<span id="an_31:10">31:10</span> For my life is spent with grief, and my
years with sighing: my strength faileth because of my iniquity, and my
bones are consumed.

<span id="an_31:11">31:11</span> I was a reproach among all my enemies,
but especially among my neighbors, and a fear to my acquaintance: they
that saw me without fled from me.

<span id="an_31:12">31:12</span> I am forgotten as a dead man out of
mind: I am like a broken vessel.

<span id="an_31:13">31:13</span> For I have heard the slander of many:
fear was on every side: while they took counsel together against me,
they devised to take away my life.

<span id="an_31:14">31:14</span> But I trusted in thee, O LORD: I said,
Thou art my God.

<span id="an_31:15">31:15</span> My times are in thy hand: deliver me
from the hand of my enemies, and from them that persecute me.

<span id="an_31:16">31:16</span> Make thy face to shine upon thy
servant: save me for thy mercies' sake.

<span id="an_31:17">31:17</span> Let me not be ashamed, O LORD; for I
have called upon thee: let the wicked be ashamed, and let them be silent
in the grave.

<span id="an_31:18">31:18</span> Let the lying lips be put to silence;
which speak grievous things proudly and contemptuously against the
righteous.

<span id="an_31:19">31:19</span> Oh how great is thy goodness, which
thou hast laid up for them that fear thee; which thou hast wrought for
them that trust in thee before the sons of men!

<span id="an_31:20">31:20</span> Thou shalt hide them in the secret of
thy presence from the pride of man: thou shalt keep them secretly in a
pavilion from the strife of tongues.

<span id="an_31:21">31:21</span> Blessed be the LORD: for he hath showed
me his wonderful kindness in a strong city.

<span id="an_31:22">31:22</span> For I said in my haste, I am cut off
from before thy eyes: nevertheless thou heardest the voice of my
supplications when I cried to thee.

<span id="an_31:23">31:23</span> O love the LORD, all ye his saints: for
the LORD preserveth the faithful, and plentifully rewardeth the proud
doer.

<span id="an_31:24">31:24</span> Be of good courage, and he will
strengthen your heart, all ye that hope in the LORD.

<span id="an_32:1">32:1</span> A Psalm of David, Maschil. Blessed is he
whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered.

<span id="an_32:2">32:2</span> Blessed is the man to whom the LORD
imputeth not iniquity, and in whose spirit there is no guile.

<span id="an_32:3">32:3</span> When I kept silence, my bones became old
through my roaring all the day long.

<span id="an_32:4">32:4</span> For day and night thy hand was heavy upon
me: my moisture is turned into the drouth of summer. Selah.

<span id="an_32:5">32:5</span> I acknowledged my sin to thee, and my
iniquity have I not hid. I said, I will confess my transgressions to the
LORD; and thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin. Selah.

<span id="an_32:6">32:6</span> For this shall every one that is godly
pray to thee in a time when thou mayest be found: surely in the floods
of great waters they shall not come nigh to him.

<span id="an_32:7">32:7</span> Thou art my hiding place; thou wilt
preserve me from trouble; thou wilt compass me about with songs of
deliverance. Selah.

<span id="an_32:8">32:8</span> I will instruct thee, and teach thee in
the way which thou shalt go: I will guide thee with my eye.

<span id="an_32:9">32:9</span> Be ye not as the horse, or as the mule,
which have no understanding: whose mouth must be held in with bit and
bridle, lest they come near to thee.

<span id="an_32:10">32:10</span> Many sorrows shall be to the wicked:
but he that trusteth in the LORD, mercy shall encompass him.

<span id="an_32:11">32:11</span> Be glad in the LORD, and rejoice, ye
righteous: and shout for joy, all ye that are upright in heart.

<span id="an_33:1">33:1</span> Rejoice in the LORD, O ye righteous: for
praise is comely for the upright.

<span id="an_33:2">33:2</span> Praise the LORD with harp: sing to him
with the psaltery and an instrument of ten strings.

<span id="an_33:3">33:3</span> Sing to him a new song; play skillfully
with a loud noise.

<span id="an_33:4">33:4</span> For the word of the LORD is right; and
all his works are done in truth.

<span id="an_33:5">33:5</span> He loveth righteousness and judgment: the
earth is full of the goodness of the LORD.

<span id="an_33:6">33:6</span> By the word of the LORD were the heavens
made; and all the host of them by the breath of his mouth.

<span id="an_33:7">33:7</span> He gathereth the waters of the sea
together as a heap: he layeth up the depth in store-houses.

<span id="an_33:8">33:8</span> Let all the earth fear the LORD: let all
the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of him.

<span id="an_33:9">33:9</span> For he spoke, and it was done; he
commanded, and it stood fast.

<span id="an_33:10">33:10</span> The LORD bringeth the counsel of the
heathen to naught: he maketh the devices of the people of no effect.

<span id="an_33:11">33:11</span> The counsel of the LORD standeth for
ever, the thoughts of his heart to all generations.

<span id="an_33:12">33:12</span> Blessed is the nation whose God is the
LORD; and the people whom he hath chosen for his own inheritance.

<span id="an_33:13">33:13</span> The LORD looketh from heaven; he
beholdeth all the sons of men.

<span id="an_33:14">33:14</span> From the place of his habitation he
looketh upon all the inhabitants of the earth.

<span id="an_33:15">33:15</span> He fashioneth their hearts alike; he
considereth all their works.

<span id="an_33:16">33:16</span> There is no king saved by the multitude
of a host: a mighty man is not delivered by much strength.

<span id="an_33:17">33:17</span> A horse is a vain thing for safety:
neither shall he deliver any by his great strength.

<span id="an_33:18">33:18</span> Behold, the eye of the LORD is upon
them that fear him, upon them that hope in his mercy;

<span id="an_33:19">33:19</span> To deliver their soul from death, and
to keep them alive in famine.

<span id="an_33:20">33:20</span> Our soul waiteth for the LORD: he is
our help and our shield.

<span id="an_33:21">33:21</span> For our heart shall rejoice in him,
because we have trusted in his holy name.

<span id="an_33:22">33:22</span> Let thy mercy, O LORD, be upon us,
according as we hope in thee.

<span id="an_34:1">34:1</span> A Psalm of David, when he changed his
behavior before Abimelech; who drove him away, and he departed. I will
bless the LORD at all times: his praise shall continually be in my
mouth.

<span id="an_34:2">34:2</span> My soul shall make her boast in the LORD:
the humble shall hear of it and be glad.

<span id="an_34:3">34:3</span> O magnify the LORD with me, and let us
exalt his name together.

<span id="an_34:4">34:4</span> I sought the LORD, and he heard me, and
delivered me from all my fears.

<span id="an_34:5">34:5</span> They looked to him, and were lightened:
and their faces were not ashamed.

<span id="an_34:6">34:6</span> This poor man cried, and the LORD heard
him, and saved him out of all his troubles.

<span id="an_34:7">34:7</span> The angel of the LORD encampeth around
them that fear him, and delivereth them.

<span id="an_34:8">34:8</span> O taste and see that the LORD is good:
blessed is the man that trusteth in him.

<span id="an_34:9">34:9</span> O fear the LORD, ye his saints: for there
is no want to them that fear him.

<span id="an_34:10">34:10</span> The young lions do lack, and suffer
hunger: but they that seek the LORD shall not want any good thing.

<span id="an_34:11">34:11</span> Come, ye children, hearken to me; I
will teach you the fear of the LORD.

<span id="an_34:12">34:12</span> What man is he that desireth life, and
loveth many days, that he may see good?

<span id="an_34:13">34:13</span> Keep thy tongue from evil, and thy lips
from speaking guile.

<span id="an_34:14">34:14</span> Depart from evil, and do good; seek
peace, and pursue it.

<span id="an_34:15">34:15</span> The eyes of the LORD are upon the
righteous, and his ears are open to their cry.

<span id="an_34:16">34:16</span> The face of the LORD is against them
that do evil, to cut off the remembrance of them from the earth.

<span id="an_34:17">34:17</span> The righteous cry, and the LORD
heareth, and delivereth them out of all their troubles.

<span id="an_34:18">34:18</span> The LORD is nigh to them that are of a
broken heart; and saveth such as are of a contrite spirit.

<span id="an_34:19">34:19</span> Many are the afflictions of the
righteous: but the LORD delivereth him out of them all.

<span id="an_34:20">34:20</span> He keepeth all his bones: not one of
them is broken.

<span id="an_34:21">34:21</span> Evil shall slay the wicked: and they
that hate the righteous shall be desolate.

<span id="an_34:22">34:22</span> The LORD redeemeth the soul of his
servants: and none of them that trust in him shall be desolate.

<span id="an_35:1">35:1</span> A Psalm of David. Plead my cause, O LORD,
with them that strive with me: fight against them that fight against me.

<span id="an_35:2">35:2</span> Take hold of shield and buckler, and
stand up for my help.

<span id="an_35:3">35:3</span> Draw out also the spear, and stop the way
against them that persecute me: say to my soul, I am thy salvation.

<span id="an_35:4">35:4</span> Let them be confounded and put to shame
that seek after my soul: let them be turned back and brought to
confusion that devise my hurt.

<span id="an_35:5">35:5</span> Let them be as chaff before the wind: and
let the angel of the LORD chase them.

<span id="an_35:6">35:6</span> Let their way be dark and slippery: and
let the angel of the LORD persecute them.

<span id="an_35:7">35:7</span> For without cause they have hid for me
their net in a pit, which without cause they have digged for my soul.

<span id="an_35:8">35:8</span> Let destruction come upon him at
unawares; and let his net that he hath hid catch himself: into that very
destruction let him fall.

<span id="an_35:9">35:9</span> And my soul shall be joyful in the LORD:
it shall rejoice in his salvation.

<span id="an_35:10">35:10</span> All my bones shall say, LORD, who is
like thee, who deliverest the poor from him that is too strong for him,
even the poor and the needy from him that spoileth him?

<span id="an_35:11">35:11</span> False witnesses arose; they laid to my
charge things that I knew not.

<span id="an_35:12">35:12</span> They rewarded me evil for good to the
spoiling of my soul.

<span id="an_35:13">35:13</span> But as for me, when they were sick, my
clothing was sackcloth: I humbled my soul with fasting; and my prayer
returned into my own bosom.

<span id="an_35:14">35:14</span> I behaved myself as though he had been
my friend or brother: I bowed down heavily, as one that mourneth for his
mother.

<span id="an_35:15">35:15</span> But in my adversity they rejoiced, and
assembled themselves: yes, the abjects assembled themselves against me,
and I knew it not; they did tear me, and ceased not:

<span id="an_35:16">35:16</span> With hypocritical mockers in feasts,
they gnashed upon me with their teeth.

<span id="an_35:17">35:17</span> Lord, how long wilt thou look on?
rescue my soul from their destructions, my darling from the lions.

<span id="an_35:18">35:18</span> I will give thee thanks in the great
congregation: I will praise thee among many people.

<span id="an_35:19">35:19</span> Let not them that are my enemies
wrongfully rejoice over me: neither let them wink with the eye that hate
me without a cause.

<span id="an_35:20">35:20</span> For they speak not peace: but they
devise deceitful matters against them that are quiet in the land.

<span id="an_35:21">35:21</span> Yes, they opened their mouth wide
against me, and said, Aha, aha, our eye hath seen it.

<span id="an_35:22">35:22</span> This thou hast seen, O LORD: keep not
silence: O Lord, be not far from me.

<span id="an_35:23">35:23</span> Stir up thyself, and awake to my
judgment, even to my cause, my God and my Lord.

<span id="an_35:24">35:24</span> Judge me, O LORD my God, according to
thy righteousness; and let them not rejoice over me.

<span id="an_35:25">35:25</span> Let them not say in their hearts, Ah,
so would we have it: let them not say, We have swallowed him up.

<span id="an_35:26">35:26</span> Let them be ashamed and brought to
confusion together that rejoice at my hurt: let them be clothed with
shame and dishonor that magnify themselves against me.

<span id="an_35:27">35:27</span> Let them shout for joy, and be glad,
that favor my righteous cause: yes, let them say continually, Let the
LORD be magnified, who hath pleasure in the prosperity of his servant.

<span id="an_35:28">35:28</span> And my tongue shall speak of thy
righteousness and of thy praise all the day long.

<span id="an_36:1">36:1</span> To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David
the servant of the LORD. The transgression of the wicked saith within my
heart, that there is no fear of God before his eyes.

<span id="an_36:2">36:2</span> For he flattereth himself in his own
eyes, until his iniquity is found to be hateful.

<span id="an_36:3">36:3</span> The words of his mouth are iniquity and
deceit: he hath ceased to be wise, and to do good.

<span id="an_36:4">36:4</span> He deviseth mischief upon his bed; he
setteth himself in a way that is not good; he abhorreth not evil.

<span id="an_36:5">36:5</span> Thy mercy, O LORD, is in the heavens; and
thy faithfulness reacheth to the clouds.

<span id="an_36:6">36:6</span> Thy righteousness is like the great
mountains; thy judgments are a great deep: O LORD, thou preservest man
and beast.

<span id="an_36:7">36:7</span> How excellent is thy loving-kindness, O
God! therefore the children of men put their trust under the shadow of
thy wings.

<span id="an_36:8">36:8</span> They shall be abundantly satisfied with
the fatness of thy house; and thou shalt make them drink of the river of
thy pleasures.

<span id="an_36:9">36:9</span> For with thee is the fountain of life: in
thy light shall we see light.

<span id="an_36:10">36:10</span> O continue thy loving-kindness to them
that know thee; and thy righteousness to the upright in heart.

<span id="an_36:11">36:11</span> Let not the foot of pride come against
me, and let not the hand of the wicked remove me.

<span id="an_36:12">36:12</span> There are the workers of iniquity
fallen: they are cast down, and shall not be able to rise.

<span id="an_37:1">37:1</span> A Psalm of David. Fret not thyself
because of evil doers, neither be thou envious against the workers of
iniquity.

<span id="an_37:2">37:2</span> For they shall soon be cut down like the
grass, and wither as the green herb.

<span id="an_37:3">37:3</span> Trust in the LORD, and do good; so shalt
thou dwell in the land, and verily thou shalt be fed.

<span id="an_37:4">37:4</span> Delight thyself also in the LORD; and he
will give thee the desires of thy heart.

<span id="an_37:5">37:5</span> Commit thy way to the LORD; trust also in
him; and he will bring it to pass.

<span id="an_37:6">37:6</span> And he will bring forth thy righteousness
as the light, and thy judgment as the noon-day.

<span id="an_37:7">37:7</span> Rest in the LORD, and wait patiently for
him: fret not thyself because of him who prospereth in his way, because
of the man who bringeth wicked devices to pass.

<span id="an_37:8">37:8</span> Cease from anger, and forsake wrath: fret
not thyself in any wise to do evil.

<span id="an_37:9">37:9</span> For evil doers shall be cut off: but
those that wait upon the LORD, they shall inherit the earth.

<span id="an_37:10">37:10</span> For yet a little while, and the wicked
shall not be: yes, thou shalt diligently consider his place, and it
shall not be.

<span id="an_37:11">37:11</span> But the meek shall inherit the earth;
and shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace.

<span id="an_37:12">37:12</span> The wicked plotteth against the just,
and gnasheth upon him with his teeth.

<span id="an_37:13">37:13</span> The Lord will laugh at him: for he
seeth that his day is coming.

<span id="an_37:14">37:14</span> The wicked have drawn out the sword,
and have bent their bow, to cast down the poor and needy, and to slay
such as are of upright deportment.

<span id="an_37:15">37:15</span> Their sword shall enter into their own
heart, and their bows shall be broken.

<span id="an_37:16">37:16</span> A little that a righteous man hath is
better than the riches of many wicked.

<span id="an_37:17">37:17</span> For the arms of the wicked shall be
broken: but the LORD upholdeth the righteous.

<span id="an_37:18">37:18</span> The LORD knoweth the days of the
upright: and their inheritance shall be for ever.

<span id="an_37:19">37:19</span> They shall not be ashamed in the evil
time: and in the days of famine they shall be satisfied.

<span id="an_37:20">37:20</span> But the wicked shall perish, and the
enemies of the LORD shall be as the fat of lambs: they shall consume;
into smoke shall they consume away.

<span id="an_37:21">37:21</span> The wicked borroweth, and payeth not
again: but the righteous showeth mercy, and giveth.

<span id="an_37:22">37:22</span> For such as are blessed by him shall
inherit the earth; and they that are cursed by him shall be cut off.

<span id="an_37:23">37:23</span> The steps of a good man are ordered by
the LORD: and he delighteth in his way.

<span id="an_37:24">37:24</span> Though he should fall, he shall not be
utterly cast down: for the LORD upholdeth him with his hand.

<span id="an_37:25">37:25</span> I have been young, and now am old; yet
I have not seen the righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging bread.

<span id="an_37:26">37:26</span> He is ever merciful, and lendeth; and
his seed is blessed.

<span id="an_37:27">37:27</span> Depart from evil, and do good; and
dwell for evermore.

<span id="an_37:28">37:28</span> For the LORD loveth judgment, and
forsaketh not his saints; they are preserved for ever: but the seed of
the wicked shall be cut off.

<span id="an_37:29">37:29</span> The righteous shall inherit the land,
and dwell therein for ever.

<span id="an_37:30">37:30</span> The mouth of the righteous speaketh
wisdom, and his tongue talketh of judgment.

<span id="an_37:31">37:31</span> The law of his God is in his heart;
none of his steps shall slide.

<span id="an_37:32">37:32</span> The wicked watcheth the righteous, and
seeketh to slay him.

<span id="an_37:33">37:33</span> The LORD will not leave him in his
hand, nor condemn him when he is judged.

<span id="an_37:34">37:34</span> Wait on the LORD, and keep his way, and
he will exalt thee to inherit the land: when the wicked are cut off,
thou shalt see it.

<span id="an_37:35">37:35</span> I have seen the wicked in great power,
and spreading himself like a green bay tree.

<span id="an_37:36">37:36</span> Yet he passed away, and lo, he was not:
yes, I sought him, but he could not be found.

<span id="an_37:37">37:37</span> Mark the perfect man, and behold the
upright: for the end of that man is peace.

<span id="an_37:38">37:38</span> But the transgressors shall be
destroyed together: the end of the wicked shall be cut off.

<span id="an_37:39">37:39</span> But the salvation of the righteous is
of the LORD: he is their strength in the time of trouble.

<span id="an_37:40">37:40</span> And the LORD will help them, and
deliver them: he will deliver them from the wicked, and save them,
because they trust in him.

<span id="an_38:1">38:1</span> A Psalm of David, to bring to
remembrance. O LORD, rebuke me not in thy wrath: neither chasten me in
thy hot displeasure.

<span id="an_38:2">38:2</span> For thy arrows stick fast in me, and thy
hand falleth heavy upon me.

<span id="an_38:3">38:3</span> There is no soundness in my flesh because
of thy anger; neither is there any rest in my bones because of my sin.

<span id="an_38:4">38:4</span> For my iniquities have gone over my head:
as a heavy burden they are too heavy for me.

<span id="an_38:5">38:5</span> My wounds are offensive, and are corrupt
because of my foolishness.

<span id="an_38:6">38:6</span> I am troubled; I am bowed down greatly; I
go mourning all the day long.

<span id="an_38:7">38:7</span> For my loins are filled with a lothsome
disease: and there is no soundness in my flesh.

<span id="an_38:8">38:8</span> I am feeble and grievously broken: I have
roared by reason of the disquietness of my heart.

<span id="an_38:9">38:9</span> Lord, all my desire is before thee; and
my groaning is not hid from thee.

<span id="an_38:10">38:10</span> My heart panteth, my strength faileth
me: as for the light of my eyes, that also is gone from me.

<span id="an_38:11">38:11</span> My lovers and my friends stand aloof
from my affliction; and my kinsmen stand afar off.

<span id="an_38:12">38:12</span> They also that seek after my life lay
snares for me: and they that seek my hurt speak mischievous things, and
imagine deceits all the day long.

<span id="an_38:13">38:13</span> But I, as a deaf man, heard not; and I
was as a dumb man that openeth not his mouth.

<span id="an_38:14">38:14</span> Thus I was as a man that heareth not,
and in whose mouth are no reproofs.

<span id="an_38:15">38:15</span> For in thee, O LORD, do I hope: thou
wilt hear, O Lord my God.

<span id="an_38:16">38:16</span> For I said, Hear me, lest otherwise
they should rejoice over me: when my foot slippeth, they magnify
themselves against me.

<span id="an_38:17">38:17</span> For I am ready to halt, and my sorrow
is continually before me.

<span id="an_38:18">38:18</span> For I will declare my iniquity; I will
be sorry for my sin.

<span id="an_38:19">38:19</span> But my enemies are lively, and they are
strong: and they that hate me wrongfully are multiplied.

<span id="an_38:20">38:20</span> They also that render evil for good are
my adversaries; because I follow the thing that is good.

<span id="an_38:21">38:21</span> Forsake me not, O LORD: O my God, be
not far from me.

<span id="an_38:22">38:22</span> Make haste to help me, O Lord my
salvation.

<span id="an_39:1">39:1</span> To the chief Musician, even to Jeduthun,
A Psalm of David. I said, I will take heed to my ways, that I sin not
with my tongue: I will keep my mouth with a bridle, while the wicked is
before me.

<span id="an_39:2">39:2</span> I was dumb with silence, I held my peace,
even from good; and my sorrow was stirred.

<span id="an_39:3">39:3</span> My heart was hot within me, while I was
musing the fire burned: then I spoke with my tongue.

<span id="an_39:4">39:4</span> LORD, make me to know my end, and the
measure of my days, what it is; that I may know how frail I am.

<span id="an_39:5">39:5</span> Behold, thou hast made my days as a
hand-breadth; and my age is as nothing before thee: verily every man at
his best state is altogether vanity. Selah.

<span id="an_39:6">39:6</span> Surely every man walketh in a vain show:
surely they are disquieted in vain: he heapeth up riches, and knoweth
not who shall gather them.

<span id="an_39:7">39:7</span> And now, Lord, what wait I for? my hope
is in thee.

<span id="an_39:8">39:8</span> Deliver me from all my transgressions:
make me not the reproach of the foolish.

<span id="an_39:9">39:9</span> I was dumb, I opened not my mouth;
because thou didst it.

<span id="an_39:10">39:10</span> Remove thy stroke away from me; I am
consumed by the blow of thy hand.

<span id="an_39:11">39:11</span> When thou with rebukes dost correct man
for iniquity, thou makest his beauty to consume away like a moth: surely
every man is vanity. Selah.

<span id="an_39:12">39:12</span> Hear my prayer, O LORD, and give ear to
my cry; hold not thy peace at my tears: for I am a stranger with thee,
and a sojourner, as all my fathers were.

<span id="an_39:13">39:13</span> O spare me, that I may recover
strength, before I go hence, and be no more.

<span id="an_40:1">40:1</span> To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David.
I waited patiently for the LORD; and he inclined to me, and heard my
cry.

<span id="an_40:2">40:2</span> He brought me up also out of a horrible
pit, out of the miry clay, and set my feet upon a rock, and established
my goings.

<span id="an_40:3">40:3</span> And he hath put a new song in my mouth,
even praise to our God: many shall see it, and fear, and shall trust in
the LORD.

<span id="an_40:4">40:4</span> Blessed is that man that maketh the LORD
his trust, and respecteth not the proud, nor such as turn aside to lies.

<span id="an_40:5">40:5</span> Many, O LORD, my God, are thy wonderful
works which thou hast done, and thy thoughts which are toward us, they
cannot be reckoned up in order to thee: if I would declare and speak of
them, they are more than can be numbered.

<span id="an_40:6">40:6</span> Sacrifice and offering thou didst not
desire; my ears hast thou opened: burnt-offering and sin-offering hast
thou not required.

<span id="an_40:7">40:7</span> Then said I, Lo, I come: in the volume of
the book it is written of me,

<span id="an_40:8">40:8</span> I delight to do thy will, O my God: yea,
thy law is within my heart.

<span id="an_40:9">40:9</span> I have preached righteousness in the
great congregation: lo, I have not refrained my lips, O LORD, thou
knowest.

<span id="an_40:10">40:10</span> I have not hid thy righteousness within
my heart; I have declared thy faithfulness and thy salvation: I have not
concealed thy loving-kindness and thy truth from the great congregation.

<span id="an_40:11">40:11</span> Withhold not thou thy tender mercies
from me, O LORD: let thy loving-kindness and thy truth continually
preserve me.

<span id="an_40:12">40:12</span> For innumerable evils have encompassed
me: my iniquities have taken hold upon me, so that I am not able to look
up; they are more than the hairs of my head: therefore my heart faileth
me.

<span id="an_40:13">40:13</span> Be pleased, O LORD, to deliver me: O
LORD, make haste to help me.

<span id="an_40:14">40:14</span> Let them be ashamed and confounded
together that seek after my soul to destroy it; let them be driven
backward and put to shame that wish me evil.

<span id="an_40:15">40:15</span> Let them be desolate for a reward of
their shame that say to me, Aha, aha.

<span id="an_40:16">40:16</span> Let all those that seek thee rejoice
and be glad in thee: let such as love thy salvation say continually, The
LORD be magnified.

<span id="an_40:17">40:17</span> But I am poor and needy; yet the Lord
thinketh upon me: thou art my help and my deliverer; make no delay, O my
God.

<span id="an_41:1">41:1</span> To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David.
Blessed is he that considereth the poor: the LORD will deliver him in
the time of trouble.

<span id="an_41:2">41:2</span> The LORD will preserve him, and keep him
alive; and he shall be blessed upon the earth: and thou wilt not deliver
him to the will of his enemies.

<span id="an_41:3">41:3</span> The LORD will strengthen him upon the bed
of languishing: thou wilt make all his bed in his sickness.

<span id="an_41:4">41:4</span> I said, LORD, be merciful to me: heal my
soul; for I have sinned against thee.

<span id="an_41:5">41:5</span> My enemies speak evil of me, When shall
he die, and his name perish?

<span id="an_41:6">41:6</span> And if he cometh to see me, he speaketh
vanity: his heart gathereth iniquity to itself; when he goeth abroad, he
telleth it.

<span id="an_41:7">41:7</span> All that hate me whisper together against
me: against me do they devise my hurt.

<span id="an_41:8">41:8</span> An evil disease, say they, cleaveth fast
to him: and now that he lieth he shall rise no more.

<span id="an_41:9">41:9</span> Yes, my own familiar friend, in whom I
trusted, who ate of my bread, hath lifted up his heel against me.

<span id="an_41:10">41:10</span> But thou, O LORD, be merciful to me,
and raise me up, that I may requite them.

<span id="an_41:11">41:11</span> By this I know that thou favorest me,
because my enemy doth not triumph over me.

<span id="an_41:12">41:12</span> And as for me, thou upholdest me in my
integrity, and settest me before thy face for ever.

<span id="an_41:13">41:13</span> Blessed be the LORD God of Israel from
everlasting, and to everlasting. Amen, and amen.

<span id="an_42:1">42:1</span> To the chief Musician, Maschil, for the
sons of Korah. As the hart panteth after the water brooks, so my soul
panteth after thee, O God.

<span id="an_42:2">42:2</span> My soul thirsteth for God, for the living
God: when shall I come and appear before God?

<span id="an_42:3">42:3</span> My tears have been my food day and night,
while they continually say to me, Where is thy God?

<span id="an_42:4">42:4</span> When I remember these things, I pour out
my soul in me: for I had gone with the multitude, I went with them to
the house of God, with the voice of joy and praise, with a multitude
that kept holy-day.

<span id="an_42:5">42:5</span> Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and
why art thou disquieted in me? hope thou in God: for I shall yet praise
him for the help of his countenance.

<span id="an_42:6">42:6</span> O my God, my soul is cast down within me:
therefore will I remember thee from the land of Jordan, and of the
Hermonites, from the hill Mizar.

<span id="an_42:7">42:7</span> Deep calleth to deep at the noise of thy
water-spouts: all thy waves and thy billows are gone over me.

<span id="an_42:8">42:8</span> Yet the LORD will command his
loving-kindness in the day-time, and in the night his song shall be with
me, and my prayer to the God of my life.

<span id="an_42:9">42:9</span> I will say to God my rock, Why hast thou
forgotten me? why go I mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?

<span id="an_42:10">42:10</span> As with a sword in my bones, my enemies
reproach me; while they say daily to me, Where is thy God?

<span id="an_42:11">42:11</span> Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and
why art thou disquieted within me? hope thou in God: for I shall yet
praise him, who is the health of my countenance, and my God.

<span id="an_43:1">43:1</span> Judge me, O God, and plead my cause
against an ungodly nation: O deliver me from the deceitful and unjust
man.

<span id="an_43:2">43:2</span> For thou art the God of my strength: why
dost thou cast me off? why go I mourning because of the oppression of
the enemy?

<span id="an_43:3">43:3</span> O send out thy light and thy truth: let
them lead me; let them bring me to thy holy hill, and to thy
tabernacles.

<span id="an_43:4">43:4</span> Then will I go to the altar of God, to
God, my exceeding joy: yes, upon the harp will I praise thee, O God my
God.

<span id="an_43:5">43:5</span> Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and
why art thou disquieted within me? hope in God: for I shall yet praise
him, who is the health of my countenance, and my God.

<span id="an_44:1">44:1</span> To the chief Musician for the sons of
Korah, Maschil. We have heard with our ears, O God, our fathers have
told us, what work thou didst in their days, in the times of old.

<span id="an_44:2">44:2</span> How thou didst drive out the heathen with
thy hand, and didst plant them; how thou didst afflict the people, and
cast them out.

<span id="an_44:3">44:3</span> For they obtained not the land in
possession by their own sword, neither did their own arm save them: but
thy right hand, and thy arm, and the light of thy countenance, because
thou hadst a favor to them.

<span id="an_44:4">44:4</span> Thou art my King, O God: command
deliverances for Jacob.

<span id="an_44:5">44:5</span> Through thee will we push down our
enemies: through thy name we will tread them under that rise up against
us.

<span id="an_44:6">44:6</span> For I will not trust in my bow, neither
shall my sword save me.

<span id="an_44:7">44:7</span> But thou hast saved us from our enemies,
and hast put them to shame that hated us.

<span id="an_44:8">44:8</span> In God we boast all the day long, and
praise thy name for ever. Selah.

<span id="an_44:9">44:9</span> But thou hast cast off, and put us to
shame; and goest not forth with our armies.

<span id="an_44:10">44:10</span> Thou makest us to turn back from the
enemy: and they who hate us plunder for themselves.

<span id="an_44:11">44:11</span> Thou hast given us like sheep appointed
for food; and hast scattered us among the heathen.

<span id="an_44:12">44:12</span> Thou sellest thy people for naught, and
dost not increase thy wealth by their price.

<span id="an_44:13">44:13</span> Thou makest us a reproach to our
neighbors, a scorn and a derision to them that are around us.

<span id="an_44:14">44:14</span> Thou makest us a by-word among the
heathen, a shaking of the head among the people.

<span id="an_44:15">44:15</span> My confusion is continually before me,
and the shame of my face hath covered me,

<span id="an_44:16">44:16</span> For the voice of him that reproacheth
and blasphemeth; by reason of the enemy and avenger.

<span id="an_44:17">44:17</span> All this is come upon us; yet we have
not forgotten thee, neither have we dealt falsely in thy covenant.

<span id="an_44:18">44:18</span> Our heart is not turned back, neither
have our steps declined from thy way;

<span id="an_44:19">44:19</span> Though thou hast severely broke us in
the place of dragons, and covered us with the shades of death.

<span id="an_44:20">44:20</span> If we have forgotten the name of our
God, or stretched out our hands to a strange god;

<span id="an_44:21">44:21</span> Will not God search out this? for he
knoweth the secrets of the heart.

<span id="an_44:22">44:22</span> Yes, for thy sake are we killed all the
day long; we are counted as sheep for the slaughter.

<span id="an_44:23">44:23</span> Awake, why sleepest thou, O Lord?
arise, cast us not off for ever.

<span id="an_44:24">44:24</span> Why hidest thou thy face, and
forgettest our affliction and our oppression?

<span id="an_44:25">44:25</span> For our soul is bowed down to the dust:
our belly cleaveth to the earth.

<span id="an_44:26">44:26</span> Arise for our help, and redeem us for
thy mercies' sake.

<span id="an_45:1">45:1</span> To the chief Musician upon Shoshannim,
for the sons of Korah, Maschil, A Song of loves. My heart is inditing a
good matter: I speak of the things which I have made concerning the
king: my tongue is the pen of a ready writer.

<span id="an_45:2">45:2</span> Thou art fairer than the children of men:
grace is poured into thy lips: therefore God hath blessed thee for ever.

<span id="an_45:3">45:3</span> Gird thy sword upon thy thigh, O most
mighty, with thy glory and thy majesty.

<span id="an_45:4">45:4</span> And in thy majesty ride prosperously
because of truth and meekness and righteousness; and thy right hand
shall teach thee terrible things.

<span id="an_45:5">45:5</span> Thy arrows are sharp in the heart of the
king's enemies; by which the people fall under thee.

<span id="an_45:6">45:6</span> Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever:
the scepter of thy kingdom is a scepter of justice.

<span id="an_45:7">45:7</span> Thou lovest righteousness, and hatest
wickedness: therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of
gladness above thy fellows.

<span id="an_45:8">45:8</span> All thy garments smell of myrrh, and
aloes, and cassia, out of the ivory palaces, by which they have made
thee glad.

<span id="an_45:9">45:9</span> Kings daughters were among thy honorable
women: upon thy right hand stood the queen in gold of Ophir.

<span id="an_45:10">45:10</span> Hearken, O daughter, and consider, and
incline thy ear; forget also thy own people, and thy father's house;

<span id="an_45:11">45:11</span> So shall the king greatly desire thy
beauty: for he is thy lord; and worship thou him.

<span id="an_45:12">45:12</span> And the daughter of Tyre shall be there
with a gift; even the rich among the people shall entreat thy favor.

<span id="an_45:13">45:13</span> The king's daughter is all glorious
within: her clothing is of wrought gold.

<span id="an_45:14">45:14</span> She shall be brought to the king in
raiment of needle-work: the virgins her companions that follow her shall
be brought to thee.

<span id="an_45:15">45:15</span> With gladness and rejoicing shall they
be brought: they shall enter into the king's palace.

<span id="an_45:16">45:16</span> Instead of thy fathers shall be thy
children, whom thou mayest make princes in all the earth.

<span id="an_45:17">45:17</span> I will make thy name to be remembered
in all generations: therefore shall the people praise thee for ever and
ever.

<span id="an_46:1">46:1</span> To the chief Musician for the sons of
Korah, A Song upon Alamoth. God is our refuge and strength, a very
present help in trouble.

<span id="an_46:2">46:2</span> Therefore will we not fear, though the
earth shall be removed, and though the mountains shall be carried into
the midst of the sea;

<span id="an_46:3">46:3</span> Though its waters shall roar and be
disturbed, though the mountains shake with the swelling of it. Selah.

<span id="an_46:4">46:4</span> There is a river, the streams of which
shall make glad the city of God, the holy place of the tabernacles of
the Most High.

<span id="an_46:5">46:5</span> God is in the midst of her; she shall not
be moved: God shall help her, and that right early.

<span id="an_46:6">46:6</span> The heathen raged, the kingdoms were
moved: he uttered his voice, the earth melted.

<span id="an_46:7">46:7</span> The LORD of hosts is with us; the God of
Jacob is our refuge. Selah.

<span id="an_46:8">46:8</span> Come, behold the works of the LORD, what
desolations he hath made in the earth.

<span id="an_46:9">46:9</span> He maketh wars to cease to the end of the
earth; he breaketh the bow, and cutteth the spear asunder; he burneth
the chariot in the fire.

<span id="an_46:10">46:10</span> Be still, and know that I am God: I
will be exalted among the heathen, I will be exalted in the earth.

<span id="an_46:11">46:11</span> The LORD of hosts is with us; the God
of Jacob is our refuge. Selah.

<span id="an_47:1">47:1</span> To the chief Musician, A Psalm for the
sons of Korah. O clap your hands, all ye people; shout to God with the
voice of triumph.

<span id="an_47:2">47:2</span> For the LORD most high is terrible; he is
a great King over all the earth.

<span id="an_47:3">47:3</span> He shall subdue the people under us, and
the nations under our feet.

<span id="an_47:4">47:4</span> He shall choose our inheritance for us,
the excellence of Jacob whom he loved. Selah.

<span id="an_47:5">47:5</span> God is gone up with a shout, the LORD
with the sound of a trumpet.

<span id="an_47:6">47:6</span> Sing praises to God, sing praises: sing
praises to our King, sing praises.

<span id="an_47:7">47:7</span> For God is the King of all the earth:
sing ye praises with understanding.

<span id="an_47:8">47:8</span> God reigneth over the heathen: God
sitteth upon the throne of his holiness.

<span id="an_47:9">47:9</span> The princes of the people are assembled,
even the people of the God of Abraham: for the shields of the earth
belong to God: he is greatly exalted.

<span id="an_48:1">48:1</span> A Song and Psalm for the sons of Korah.
Great is the LORD, and greatly to be praised in the city of our God, in
the mountain of his holiness.

<span id="an_48:2">48:2</span> Beautiful for situation, the joy of the
whole earth, is mount Zion, on the sides of the north, the city of the
great King.

<span id="an_48:3">48:3</span> God is known in her palaces for a refuge.

<span id="an_48:4">48:4</span> For lo, the kings were assembled, they
passed by together.

<span id="an_48:5">48:5</span> They saw it, and so they wondered; they
were troubled, and hasted away.

<span id="an_48:6">48:6</span> Fear took hold upon them there, and pain,
as of a woman in travail.

<span id="an_48:7">48:7</span> Thou breakest the ships of Tarshish with
an east wind.

<span id="an_48:8">48:8</span> As we have heard, so have we seen in the
city of the LORD of hosts, in the city of our God: God will establish it
for ever. Selah.

<span id="an_48:9">48:9</span> We have thought of thy loving-kindness, O
God, in the midst of thy temple.

<span id="an_48:10">48:10</span> According to thy name, O God, so is thy
praise to the ends of the earth: thy right hand is full of
righteousness.

<span id="an_48:11">48:11</span> Let mount Zion rejoice, let the
daughters of Judah be glad, because of thy judgments.

<span id="an_48:12">48:12</span> Walk about Zion, and go round her:
number her towers.

<span id="an_48:13">48:13</span> Mark ye well her bulwarks, consider her
palaces; that ye may tell it to the generation following.

<span id="an_48:14">48:14</span> For this God is our God for ever and
ever: he will be our guide even to death.

<span id="an_49:1">49:1</span> To the chief Musician, A Psalm for the
sons of Korah. Hear this, all ye people; give ear, all ye inhabitants of
the world:

<span id="an_49:2">49:2</span> Both low and high, rich and poor
together.

<span id="an_49:3">49:3</span> My mouth shall speak of wisdom; and the
meditation of my heart shall be of understanding.

<span id="an_49:4">49:4</span> I will incline my ear to a parable: I
will open my dark saying upon the harp.

<span id="an_49:5">49:5</span> Why should I fear in the days of evil,
when the iniquity of my heels shall encompass me?

<span id="an_49:6">49:6</span> They that trust in their wealth, and
boast themselves in the multitude of their riches;

<span id="an_49:7">49:7</span> None of them can by any means redeem his
brother, nor give to God a ransom for him:

<span id="an_49:8">49:8</span> (For the redemption of their soul is
precious, and it ceaseth for ever:)

<span id="an_49:9">49:9</span> That he should still live for ever, and
not see corruption.

<span id="an_49:10">49:10</span> For he seeth that wise men die,
likewise the fool and the brutish person perish, and leave their wealth
to others.

<span id="an_49:11">49:11</span> Their inward thought is, that their
houses shall continue for ever, and their dwelling places to all
generations; they call their lands after their own names.

<span id="an_49:12">49:12</span> Nevertheless man being in honor abideth
not: he is like the beasts that perish.

<span id="an_49:13">49:13</span> This their way is their folly: yet
their posterity approve their sayings. Selah.

<span id="an_49:14">49:14</span> Like sheep they are laid in the grave;
death shall feed on them; and the upright shall have dominion over them
in the morning; and their beauty shall consume in the grave from their
dwelling.

<span id="an_49:15">49:15</span> But God will redeem my soul from the
power of the grave: for he shall receive me. Selah.

<span id="an_49:16">49:16</span> Be not thou afraid when one is made
rich, when the glory of his house is increased;

<span id="an_49:17">49:17</span> For when he dieth he shall carry
nothing away: his glory shall not descend after him.

<span id="an_49:18">49:18</span> Though while he lived he blessed his
soul: and men will praise thee, when thou doest well to thyself.

<span id="an_49:19">49:19</span> He shall go to the generation of his
fathers; they shall never see light.

<span id="an_49:20">49:20</span> Man that is in honor, and understandeth
not, is like the beasts that perish.

<span id="an_50:1">50:1</span> A Psalm of Asaph. The mighty God, even
the LORD, hath spoken, and called the earth from the rising to the
setting of the sun.

<span id="an_50:2">50:2</span> Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty,
God hath shined.

<span id="an_50:3">50:3</span> Our God shall come, and shall not keep
silence: a fire shall devour before him, and it shall be very
tempestuous around him.

<span id="an_50:4">50:4</span> He shall call to the heavens from above,
and to the earth, that he may judge his people.

<span id="an_50:5">50:5</span> Gather my saints together to me; those
that have made a covenant with me by sacrifice.

<span id="an_50:6">50:6</span> And the heavens shall declare his
righteousness: for God is judge himself. Selah.

<span id="an_50:7">50:7</span> Hear, O my people, and I will speak; O
Israel, and I will testify against thee: I am God, even thy God.

<span id="an_50:8">50:8</span> I will not reprove thee for thy
sacrifices or thy burnt-offerings, to have been continually before me.

<span id="an_50:9">50:9</span> I will take no bullock out of thy house,
nor he-goats out of thy folds.

<span id="an_50:10">50:10</span> For every beast of the forest is mine,
and the cattle upon a thousand hills.

<span id="an_50:11">50:11</span> I know all the fowls of the mountains:
and the wild beasts of the field are mine.

<span id="an_50:12">50:12</span> If I were hungry, I would not tell
thee: for the world is mine, and the fullness thereof.

<span id="an_50:13">50:13</span> Will I eat the flesh of bulls, or drink
the blood of goats?

<span id="an_50:14">50:14</span> Offer to God thanksgiving; and pay thy
vows to the Most High:

<span id="an_50:15">50:15</span> And call upon me in the day of trouble:
I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me.

<span id="an_50:16">50:16</span> But to the wicked God saith, What hast
thou to do to declare my statutes, or that thou shouldest take my
covenant in thy mouth?

<span id="an_50:17">50:17</span> Seeing thou hatest instruction, and
castest my words behind thee.

<span id="an_50:18">50:18</span> When thou sawest a thief, then thou
consentedst with him, and hast been partaker with adulterers.

<span id="an_50:19">50:19</span> Thou givest thy mouth to evil, and thy
tongue frameth deceit.

<span id="an_50:20">50:20</span> Thou sittest and speakest against thy
brother; thou slanderest thy own mother's son.

<span id="an_50:21">50:21</span> These things hast thou done, and I kept
silence; thou thoughtest that I was altogether such an one as thyself:
but I will reprove thee, and set them in order before thine eyes.

<span id="an_50:22">50:22</span> Now consider this, ye that forget God,
lest I tear you in pieces, and there be none to deliver.

<span id="an_50:23">50:23</span> Whoever offereth praise glorifieth me:
and to him that ordereth his deportment aright will I show the salvation
of God.

<span id="an_51:1">51:1</span> To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David,
when Nathan the prophet came to him, after he had gone in to Bath-sheba.
Have mercy upon me, O God, according to thy loving-kindness: according
to the multitude of thy tender mercies, blot out my transgressions.

<span id="an_51:2">51:2</span> Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity, and
cleanse me from my sin.

<span id="an_51:3">51:3</span> For I acknowledge my transgressions: and
my sin is ever before me.

<span id="an_51:4">51:4</span> Against thee, thee only, have I sinned,
and done this evil in thy sight: that thou mayest be justified when thou
speakest, and be clear when thou judgest.

<span id="an_51:5">51:5</span> Behold, I was shapen in iniquity; and in
sin did my mother conceive me.

<span id="an_51:6">51:6</span> Behold, thou desirest truth in the inward
parts: and in the hidden part thou shalt make me to know wisdom.

<span id="an_51:7">51:7</span> Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be
clean: wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.

<span id="an_51:8">51:8</span> Make me to hear joy and gladness; that
the bones which thou hast broken may rejoice.

<span id="an_51:9">51:9</span> Hide thy face from my sins, and blot out
all my iniquities.

<span id="an_51:10">51:10</span> Create in me a clean heart, O God; and
renew a right spirit within me.

<span id="an_51:11">51:11</span> Cast me not away from thy presence; and
take not thy holy spirit from me.

<span id="an_51:12">51:12</span> Restore to me the joy of thy salvation;
and uphold me with thy free spirit.

<span id="an_51:13">51:13</span> Then will I teach transgressors thy
ways; and sinners shall be converted to thee.

<span id="an_51:14">51:14</span> Deliver me from blood-guiltiness, O
God, thou God of my salvation: and my tongue shall sing aloud of thy
righteousness.

<span id="an_51:15">51:15</span> O Lord, open thou my lips; and my mouth
shall show forth thy praise.

<span id="an_51:16">51:16</span> For thou desirest not sacrifice: else
would I give it: thou delightest not in burnt-offering.

<span id="an_51:17">51:17</span> The sacrifices of God are a broken
spirit: a broken and a contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise.

<span id="an_51:18">51:18</span> Do good in thy good pleasure to Zion:
build thou the walls of Jerusalem.

<span id="an_51:19">51:19</span> Then shalt thou be pleased with the
sacrifices of righteousness, with burnt-offering and whole
burnt-offering: then shall they offer bullocks upon thy altar.

<span id="an_52:1">52:1</span> To the chief Musician, Maschil, A Psalm
of David, when Doeg the Edomite came and told Saul, and said to him,
David is come to the house of Ahimelech. Why boastest thou thyself in
mischief, O mighty man? the goodness of God endureth continually.

<span id="an_52:2">52:2</span> Thy tongue deviseth mischiefs; like a
sharp razor, working deceitfully.

<span id="an_52:3">52:3</span> Thou lovest evil more than good; and
lying rather than to speak righteousness. Selah.

<span id="an_52:4">52:4</span> Thou lovest all devouring words, O thou
deceitful tongue.

<span id="an_52:5">52:5</span> God shall likewise destroy thee for ever,
he shall take thee away, and pluck thee out of thy dwelling-place, and
root thee out of the land of the living. Selah.

<span id="an_52:6">52:6</span> The righteous also shall see, and fear,
and shall laugh at him:

<span id="an_52:7">52:7</span> Lo, this is the man that made not God his
strength; but trusted in the abundance of his riches, and strengthened
himself in his wickedness.

<span id="an_52:8">52:8</span> But I am like a green olive tree in the
house of God: I trust in the mercy of God for ever and ever.

<span id="an_52:9">52:9</span> I will praise thee for ever, because thou
hast done it: and I will wait on thy name; for it is good before thy
saints.

<span id="an_53:1">53:1</span> To the chief Musician upon Mahalath,
Maschil, A Psalm of David. The fool hath said in his heart, There is no
God. They are corrupt, and have done abominable iniquity: there is none
that doeth good.

<span id="an_53:2">53:2</span> God looked down from heaven upon the
children of men, to see if there were any that did understand, that did
seek God.

<span id="an_53:3">53:3</span> Every one of them is gone back: they are
altogether become filthy; there is none that doeth good, no, not one.

<span id="an_53:4">53:4</span> Have the workers of iniquity no
knowledge? who eat up my people as they eat bread! they have not called
upon God.

<span id="an_53:5">53:5</span> There they were in great fear, where no
fear was: for God hath scattered the bones of him that encampeth against
thee: thou hast put them to shame, because God hath despised them.

<span id="an_53:6">53:6</span> O that the salvation of Israel were come
out of Zion! when God bringeth back the captivity of his people, Jacob
shall rejoice, and Israel shall be glad.

<span id="an_54:1">54:1</span> To the chief Musician on Neginoth,
Maschil, A Psalm of David, when the Ziphims came and said to Saul, Doth
not David hide himself with us? Save me, O God, by thy name, and judge
me by thy strength.

<span id="an_54:2">54:2</span> Hear my prayer, O God; give ear to the
words of my mouth.

<span id="an_54:3">54:3</span> For strangers have risen up against me,
and oppressors seek after my soul: they have not set God before them.
Selah.

<span id="an_54:4">54:4</span> Behold, God is my helper: the Lord is
with them that uphold my soul.

<span id="an_54:5">54:5</span> He will reward evil to my enemies; cut
them off in thy truth.

<span id="an_54:6">54:6</span> I will freely sacrifice to thee: I will
praise thy name, O LORD; for it is good.

<span id="an_54:7">54:7</span> For he hath delivered me out of all
trouble: and my eye hath seen its desire upon my enemies.

<span id="an_55:1">55:1</span> To the chief Musician on Neginoth,
Maschil, A Psalm of David. Give ear to my prayer, O God; and hide not
thyself from my supplication.

<span id="an_55:2">55:2</span> Attend to me, and hear me: I mourn in my
complaint, and make a noise;

<span id="an_55:3">55:3</span> Because of the voice of the enemy,
because of the oppression of the wicked: for they cast iniquity upon me,
and in wrath they hate me.

<span id="an_55:4">55:4</span> My heart is severely pained within me:
and the terrors of death have fallen upon me.

<span id="an_55:5">55:5</span> Fearfulness and trembling have come upon
me, and horror hath overwhelmed me.

<span id="an_55:6">55:6</span> And I said, O that I had wings like a
dove! for then I would fly away, and be at rest.

<span id="an_55:7">55:7</span> Lo, then I would wander far off, and
remain in the wilderness. Selah.

<span id="an_55:8">55:8</span> I would hasten my escape from the windy
storm and tempest.

<span id="an_55:9">55:9</span> Destroy, O Lord, and divide their
tongues: for I have seen violence and strife in the city.

<span id="an_55:10">55:10</span> Day and night they go about it upon its
walls: mischief also and sorrow are in the midst of it.

<span id="an_55:11">55:11</span> Wickedness is in the midst of it:
deceit and guile depart not from her streets.

<span id="an_55:12">55:12</span> For it was not an enemy that reproached
me; then I could have borne it: neither was it he that hated me that
magnified himself against me; then I would have hid myself from him:

<span id="an_55:13">55:13</span> But it was thou, a man my equal, my
guide, and my acquaintance.

<span id="an_55:14">55:14</span> We took sweet counsel together, and
walked to the house of God in company.

<span id="an_55:15">55:15</span> Let death seize upon them, and let them
go down quick into hell: for wickedness is in their dwellings, and among
them.

<span id="an_55:16">55:16</span> As for me, I will call upon God: and
the LORD will save me.

<span id="an_55:17">55:17</span> Evening, and morning, and at noon, will
I pray, and cry aloud: and he will hear my voice.

<span id="an_55:18">55:18</span> He hath delivered my soul in peace from
the battle that was against me: for there were many with me.

<span id="an_55:19">55:19</span> God will hear and afflict them, even he
that abideth of old. Selah. Because they have no changes, therefore they
fear not God.

<span id="an_55:20">55:20</span> He hath put forth his hands against
such as are at peace with him: he hath broken his covenant.

<span id="an_55:21">55:21</span> The words of his mouth were smoother
than butter, but war was in his heart: his words were softer than oil,
yet were they drawn swords.

<span id="an_55:22">55:22</span> Cast thy burden upon the LORD, and he
will sustain thee: he will never suffer the righteous to be moved.

<span id="an_55:23">55:23</span> But thou, O God, wilt bring them down
into the pit of destruction: bloody and deceitful men shall not live out
half their days; but I will trust in thee.

<span id="an_56:1">56:1</span> To the chief Musician upon
Jonathelem-rechokim, Michtam of David, when the Philistines took him in
Gath. Be merciful to me, O God: for man would swallow me up; he fighting
daily oppresseth me.

<span id="an_56:2">56:2</span> My enemies would daily swallow me up: for
they are many that fight against me, O thou Most High.

<span id="an_56:3">56:3</span> In the time when I am afraid, I will
trust in thee.

<span id="an_56:4">56:4</span> In God I will praise his word, in God I
have put my trust; I will not fear what flesh can do to me.

<span id="an_56:5">56:5</span> Every day they wrest my words: all their
thoughts are against me for evil.

<span id="an_56:6">56:6</span> They assemble themselves, they hide
themselves, they mark my steps, when they wait for my soul.

<span id="an_56:7">56:7</span> Shall they escape by iniquity; in thy
anger cast down the people, O God.

<span id="an_56:8">56:8</span> Thou numberest my wanderings: put thou my
tears into thy bottle: are they not in thy book?

<span id="an_56:9">56:9</span> When I cry to thee, then shall my enemies
turn back: this I know; for God is for me.

<span id="an_56:10">56:10</span> In God will I praise his word: in the
LORD will I praise his word.

<span id="an_56:11">56:11</span> In God have I put my trust: I will not
be afraid what man can do to me.

<span id="an_56:12">56:12</span> Thy vows are upon me, O God: I will
render praises to thee.

<span id="an_56:13">56:13</span> For thou hast delivered my soul from
death: wilt thou not deliver my feet from falling, that I may walk
before God in the light of the living?

<span id="an_57:1">57:1</span> To the chief Musician, Al-taschith,
Michtam of David, when he fled from Saul in the cave. Be merciful to me,
O God, be merciful to me: for my soul trusteth in thee: yes, in the
shadow of thy wings will I make my refuge, until these calamities are
overpast.

<span id="an_57:2">57:2</span> I will cry to God most high; to God that
performeth all things for me.

<span id="an_57:3">57:3</span> He shall send from heaven, and save me
from the reproach of him that would swallow me up. Selah. God shall send
forth his mercy and his truth.

<span id="an_57:4">57:4</span> My soul is among lions: and I lie even
among them that are set on fire, even the sons of men, whose teeth are
spears and arrows, and their tongue a sharp sword.

<span id="an_57:5">57:5</span> Be thou exalted, O God, above the
heavens; let thy glory be above all the earth.

<span id="an_57:6">57:6</span> They have prepared a net for my steps; my
soul is bowed down: they have digged a pit before me, into the midst of
which they have fallen themselves. Selah.

<span id="an_57:7">57:7</span> My heart is fixed, O God, my heart is
fixed: I will sing and give praise.

<span id="an_57:8">57:8</span> Awake, my glory; awake, psaltery and
harp: I myself will awake early.

<span id="an_57:9">57:9</span> I will praise thee, O Lord, among the
people: I will sing to thee among the nations.

<span id="an_57:10">57:10</span> For thy mercy is great to the heavens,
and thy truth to the clouds.

<span id="an_57:11">57:11</span> Be thou exalted, O God, above the
heavens: let thy glory be above all the earth.

<span id="an_58:1">58:1</span> To the chief Musician, Al-taschith,
Michtam of David. Do ye indeed speak righteousness, O congregation? do
ye judge uprightly, O ye sons of men?

<span id="an_58:2">58:2</span> Yes, in heart ye work wickedness; ye
weigh the violence of your hands in the earth.

<span id="an_58:3">58:3</span> The wicked are estranged from their
birth: they go astray as soon as they are born, speaking lies.

<span id="an_58:4">58:4</span> Their poison is like the poison of a
serpent: they are like the deaf adder that stoppeth her ear;

<span id="an_58:5">58:5</span> Which will not hearken to the voice of
charmers, charming never so wisely.

<span id="an_58:6">58:6</span> Break their teeth, O God, in their mouth:
break out the great teeth of the young lions, O LORD.

<span id="an_58:7">58:7</span> Let them melt away as waters which run
continually: when he bendeth his bow to shoot his arrows, let them be as
cut in pieces.

<span id="an_58:8">58:8</span> As a snail which melteth, let every one
of them pass away: like the untimely birth of a woman, that they may not
see the sun.

<span id="an_58:9">58:9</span> Before your pots can feel the thorns, he
shall take them away as with a whirlwind, both living, and in his wrath.

<span id="an_58:10">58:10</span> The righteous shall rejoice when he
seeth the vengeance: he shall wash his feet in the blood of the wicked.

<span id="an_58:11">58:11</span> So that a man shall say, Verily there
is a reward for the righteous: verily he is a God that judgeth in the
earth.

<span id="an_59:1">59:1</span> To the chief Musician, Al-taschith,
Michtam of David; when Saul sent, and they watched the house to kill
him. Deliver me from my enemies, O my God: defend me from them that rise
up against me.

<span id="an_59:2">59:2</span> Deliver me from the workers of iniquity,
and save me from bloody men.

<span id="an_59:3">59:3</span> For lo, they lie in wait for my soul: the
mighty are gathered against me; not for my transgression, nor for my
sin, O LORD.

<span id="an_59:4">59:4</span> They run and prepare themselves without
my fault: awake to help me, and behold.

<span id="an_59:5">59:5</span> Thou therefore, O LORD God of hosts, the
God of Israel, awake to visit all the heathen: be not merciful to any
wicked transgressors. Selah.

<span id="an_59:6">59:6</span> They return at evening: they make a noise
like a dog, and go about the city.

<span id="an_59:7">59:7</span> Behold, they belch out with their mouth:
swords are in their lips: for who, say they, doth hear?

<span id="an_59:8">59:8</span> But thou, O LORD, shalt laugh at them;
thou shalt have all the heathen in derision.

<span id="an_59:9">59:9</span> Because of his strength will I wait upon
thee: for God is my defense.

<span id="an_59:10">59:10</span> The God of my mercy will succor me: God
will let me see my desire upon my enemies.

<span id="an_59:11">59:11</span> Slay them not, lest my people forget:
scatter them by thy power; and bring them down, O Lord our shield.

<span id="an_59:12">59:12</span> For the sin of their mouth and the
words of their lips let them even be taken in their pride: and for
cursing and lying which they speak.

<span id="an_59:13">59:13</span> Consume them in wrath, consume them,
that they may not be: and let them know that God ruleth in Jacob to the
ends of the earth. Selah.

<span id="an_59:14">59:14</span> And at evening let them return; and let
them make a noise like a dog, and go about the city.

<span id="an_59:15">59:15</span> Let them wander up and down for food,
and grudge if they are not satisfied.

<span id="an_59:16">59:16</span> But I will sing of thy power; yes, I
will sing aloud of thy mercy in the morning: for thou hast been my
defense and refuge in the day of my trouble.

<span id="an_59:17">59:17</span> To thee, O my strength, will I sing:
for God is my defense, and the God of my mercy.

<span id="an_60:1">60:1</span> To the chief Musician upon Shushan-eduth,
Michtam of David, to teach; when he strove with Aram-naharaim and with
Aram-zobah, when Joab returned, and smote of Edom in the valley of salt
twelve thousand. O God, thou hast cast us off, thou hast scattered us,
thou hast been displeased; O turn thyself to us again.

<span id="an_60:2">60:2</span> Thou hast made the earth to tremble; thou
hast broken it: heal its breaches; for it shaketh.

<span id="an_60:3">60:3</span> Thou hast shown thy people hard things:
thou hast made us to drink the wine of astonishment.

<span id="an_60:4">60:4</span> Thou hast given a banner to them that
fear thee, that it may be displayed because of the truth. Selah.

<span id="an_60:5">60:5</span> That thy beloved may be delivered; save
with thy right hand, and hear me.

<span id="an_60:6">60:6</span> God hath spoken in his holiness; I will
rejoice, I will divide Shechem, and measure out the valley of Succoth.

<span id="an_60:7">60:7</span> Gilead is mine, and Manasseh is mine;
Ephraim also is the strength of my head; Judah is my lawgiver;

<span id="an_60:8">60:8</span> Moab is my washpot; over Edom will I cast
out my shoe: Philistia, triumph thou because of me.

<span id="an_60:9">60:9</span> Who will bring me into the strong city?
who will lead me into Edom?

<span id="an_60:10">60:10</span> Wilt thou not, O God, who hadst cast us
off? and thou, O God, who didst not go out with our armies?

<span id="an_60:11">60:11</span> Give us help from trouble: for vain is
the help of man.

<span id="an_60:12">60:12</span> Through God we shall do valiantly: for
he will tread down our enemies.

<span id="an_61:1">61:1</span> To the chief Musician upon Neginah, A
Psalm of David. Hear my cry, O God; attend to my prayer.

<span id="an_61:2">61:2</span> From the end of the earth will I cry to
thee, when my heart is overwhelmed: lead me to the rock that is higher
than I.

<span id="an_61:3">61:3</span> For thou hast been a shelter for me, and
a strong tower from the enemy.

<span id="an_61:4">61:4</span> I will abide in thy tabernacle for ever:
I will trust in the covert of thy wings. Selah.

<span id="an_61:5">61:5</span> For thou, O God, hast heard my vows: thou
hast given me the heritage of those that fear thy name.

<span id="an_61:6">61:6</span> Thou wilt prolong the king's life: and
his years as many generations.

<span id="an_61:7">61:7</span> He shall abide before God for ever: O
prepare mercy and truth, which may preserve him.

<span id="an_61:8">61:8</span> So will I sing praise to thy name for
ever, that I may daily perform my vows.

<span id="an_62:1">62:1</span> To the chief Musician, to Jeduthun, A
Psalm of David. Truly my soul waiteth upon God: from him cometh my
salvation.

<span id="an_62:2">62:2</span> He only is my rock and my salvation; he
is my defense; I shall not be greatly moved.

<span id="an_62:3">62:3</span> How long will ye imagine mischief against
a man? ye shall be slain all of you: as a bowing wall shall ye be, and
as a tottering fence.

<span id="an_62:4">62:4</span> They only consult to cast him down from
his excellence: they delight in lies: they bless with their mouth, but
they curse inwardly. Selah.

<span id="an_62:5">62:5</span> My soul, wait thou only upon God; for my
expectation is from him.

<span id="an_62:6">62:6</span> He only is my rock and my salvation: he
is my defense; I shall not be moved.

<span id="an_62:7">62:7</span> In God is my salvation and my glory: the
rock of my strength, and my refuge, is in God.

<span id="an_62:8">62:8</span> Trust in him at all times; ye people,
pour out your heart before him: God is a refuge for us. Selah.

<span id="an_62:9">62:9</span> Surely men of low degree are vanity, and
men of high degree are a lie: to be laid in the balance, they are
altogether lighter than vanity.

<span id="an_62:10">62:10</span> Trust not in oppression, and become not
vain in robbery: if riches increase, set not your heart upon them.

<span id="an_62:11">62:11</span> God hath spoken once; twice have I
heard this; that power belongeth to God.

<span id="an_62:12">62:12</span> Also to thee, O Lord, belongeth mercy:
for thou renderest to every man according to his work.

<span id="an_63:1">63:1</span> A Psalm of David, when he was in the
wilderness of Judah. O God, thou art my God; early will I seek thee: my
soul thirsteth for thee, my flesh longeth for thee in a dry and thirsty
land, where no water is;

<span id="an_63:2">63:2</span> To see thy power and thy glory, so as I
have seen thee in the sanctuary.

<span id="an_63:3">63:3</span> Because thy loving-kindness is better
than life, my lips shall praise thee.

<span id="an_63:4">63:4</span> Thus will I bless thee while I live: I
will lift up my hands in thy name.

<span id="an_63:5">63:5</span> My soul shall be satisfied as with marrow
and fatness; and my mouth shall praise thee with joyful lips:

<span id="an_63:6">63:6</span> When I remember thee upon my bed, and
meditate on thee in the night watches.

<span id="an_63:7">63:7</span> Because thou hast been my help, therefore
in the shadow of thy wings will I rejoice.

<span id="an_63:8">63:8</span> My soul followeth hard after thee: thy
right hand upholdeth me.

<span id="an_63:9">63:9</span> But those that seek my soul to destroy
it, shall go into the lower parts of the earth.

<span id="an_63:10">63:10</span> They shall fall by the sword: they
shall be a portion for foxes.

<span id="an_63:11">63:11</span> But the king shall rejoice in God;
every one that sweareth by him shall glory: but the mouth of them that
speak lies shall be stopped.

<span id="an_64:1">64:1</span> To the chief Musician, a Psalm of David.
Hear my voice, O God, in my prayer: preserve my life from fear of the
enemy.

<span id="an_64:2">64:2</span> Hide me from the secret counsel of the
wicked; from the insurrection of the workers of iniquity:

<span id="an_64:3">64:3</span> Who whet their tongue like a sword, and
bend their bows to shoot their arrows, even bitter words:

<span id="an_64:4">64:4</span> That they may shoot in secret at the
perfect: suddenly do they shoot at him, and fear not.

<span id="an_64:5">64:5</span> They encourage themselves in an evil
matter: they commune of laying snares privily; they say, Who will see
them?

<span id="an_64:6">64:6</span> They search out iniquities; they
accomplish a diligent search: both the inward thought of every one of
them, and the heart, is deep.

<span id="an_64:7">64:7</span> But God shall shoot at them with an
arrow; suddenly shall they be wounded.

<span id="an_64:8">64:8</span> So they shall make their own tongue to
fall upon themselves: all that see them shall flee away.

<span id="an_64:9">64:9</span> And all men shall fear, and shall declare
the work of God; for they shall wisely consider of his doing.

<span id="an_64:10">64:10</span> The righteous shall be glad in the
LORD, and shall trust in him; and all the upright in heart shall glory.

<span id="an_65:1">65:1</span> To the chief Musician, A Psalm and Song
of David. Praise waiteth for thee, O God, in Zion: and to thee shall the
vow be performed.

<span id="an_65:2">65:2</span> O thou that hearest prayer, to thee shall
all flesh come.

<span id="an_65:3">65:3</span> Iniquities prevail against me: as for our
transgressions, thou shalt purge them away.

<span id="an_65:4">65:4</span> Blessed is the man whom thou choosest,
and causest to approach to thee, that he may dwell in thy courts: we
shall be satisfied with the goodness of thy house, even of thy holy
temple.

<span id="an_65:5">65:5</span> By terrible things in righteousness wilt
thou answer us, O God of our salvation; who art the confidence of all
the ends of the earth, and of them that are afar off upon the sea:

<span id="an_65:6">65:6</span> Who by his strength setteth fast the
mountains; being girded with power:

<span id="an_65:7">65:7</span> Who stilleth the noise of the seas, the
noise of their waves, and the tumult of the people.

<span id="an_65:8">65:8</span> They also that dwell in the uttermost
parts are afraid at thy tokens: thou makest the outgoings of the morning
and evening to rejoice.

<span id="an_65:9">65:9</span> Thou visitest the earth, and waterest it:
thou greatly enrichest it with the river of God, which is full of water:
thou preparest them corn, when thou hast so provided for it.

<span id="an_65:10">65:10</span> Thou waterest the ridges of it
abundantly: thou settlest the furrows of it: thou makest it soft with
showers: thou blessest the springing of it.

<span id="an_65:11">65:11</span> Thou crownest the year with thy
goodness; and thy paths drop fatness.

<span id="an_65:12">65:12</span> They drop upon the pastures of the
wilderness: and the little hills rejoice on every side.

<span id="an_65:13">65:13</span> The pastures are clothed with flocks;
the valleys also are covered over with corn; they shout for joy, they
also sing.

<span id="an_66:1">66:1</span> To the chief Musician, A Song or Psalm.
Make a joyful noise to God, all ye lands:

<span id="an_66:2">66:2</span> Sing forth the honor of his name: make
his praise glorious.

<span id="an_66:3">66:3</span> Say to God, How terrible art thou in thy
works! through the greatness of thy power shall thy enemies submit
themselves to thee.

<span id="an_66:4">66:4</span> All the earth shall worship thee, and
shall sing to thee; they shall sing to thy name. Selah.

<span id="an_66:5">66:5</span> Come and see the works of God: he is
terrible in his doing towards the children of men.

<span id="an_66:6">66:6</span> He turned the sea into dry land: they
went through the flood on foot: there we rejoiced in him.

<span id="an_66:7">66:7</span> He ruleth by his power for ever; his eyes
behold the nations: let not the rebellious exalt themselves. Selah.

<span id="an_66:8">66:8</span> O bless our God, ye people, and make the
voice of his praise to be heard:

<span id="an_66:9">66:9</span> Who holdeth our soul in life, and
suffereth not our feet to be moved.

<span id="an_66:10">66:10</span> For thou, O God, hast proved us: thou
hast tried us, as silver is tried.

<span id="an_66:11">66:11</span> Thou hast brought us into the net; thou
hast laid affliction upon our loins.

<span id="an_66:12">66:12</span> Thou hast caused men to ride over our
heads; we went through fire and through water: but thou broughtest us
out into a wealthy place.

<span id="an_66:13">66:13</span> I will go into thy house with
burnt-offerings: I will pay thee my vows,

<span id="an_66:14">66:14</span> Which my lips have uttered, and my
mouth hath spoken, when I was in trouble.

<span id="an_66:15">66:15</span> I will offer to thee burnt-sacrifices
of fatlings, with the incense of rams; I will offer bullocks with goats.
Selah.

<span id="an_66:16">66:16</span> Come and hear, all ye that fear God,
and I will declare what he hath done for my soul.

<span id="an_66:17">66:17</span> I cried to him with my mouth, and he
was extolled with my tongue.

<span id="an_66:18">66:18</span> If I regard iniquity in my heart, the
Lord will not hear me:

<span id="an_66:19">66:19</span> But verily God hath heard me; he hath
attended to the voice of my prayer.

<span id="an_66:20">66:20</span> Blessed be God, who hath not turned
away my prayer, nor his mercy from me.

<span id="an_67:1">67:1</span> To the chief Musician on Neginoth, A
Psalm or Song. God be merciful to us, and bless us; and cause his face
to shine upon us. Selah.

<span id="an_67:2">67:2</span> That thy way may be known upon earth, thy
saving health among all nations.

<span id="an_67:3">67:3</span> Let the people praise thee, O God; let
all the people praise thee.

<span id="an_67:4">67:4</span> O let the nations be glad and sing for
joy: for thou shalt judge the people righteously, and govern the nations
upon earth. Selah.

<span id="an_67:5">67:5</span> Let the people praise thee, O God; let
all the people praise thee.

<span id="an_67:6">67:6</span> Then shall the earth yield her increase;
and God, even our own God, will bless us.

<span id="an_67:7">67:7</span> God will bless us, and all the ends of
the earth shall fear him.

<span id="an_68:1">68:1</span> To the chief Musician, A Psalm or Song of
David. Let God arise, let his enemies be scattered: let them also that
hate him flee before him.

<span id="an_68:2">68:2</span> As smoke is driven away, so drive them
away: as wax melteth before the fire, so let the wicked perish at the
presence of God.

<span id="an_68:3">68:3</span> But let the righteous be glad; let them
rejoice before God: yes, let them exceedingly rejoice.

<span id="an_68:4">68:4</span> Sing to God, sing praises to his name:
extol him that rideth upon the heavens by his name JAH, and rejoice
before him.

<span id="an_68:5">68:5</span> A father of the fatherless, and a judge
of the widows, is God in his holy habitation.

<span id="an_68:6">68:6</span> God setteth the solitary in families: he
bringeth out those who are bound with chains: but the rebellious dwell
in a dry land.

<span id="an_68:7">68:7</span> O God, when thou wentest forth before thy
people, when thou didst march through the wilderness; Selah:

<span id="an_68:8">68:8</span> The earth shook, the heavens also dropped
at the presence of God: even Sinai itself was moved at the presence of
God, the God of Israel.

<span id="an_68:9">68:9</span> Thou, O God, didst send a plentiful rain,
by which thou didst confirm thy inheritance, when it was weary.

<span id="an_68:10">68:10</span> Thy congregation hath dwelt therein:
thou, O God, hast prepared of thy goodness for the poor.

<span id="an_68:11">68:11</span> The Lord gave the word: great was the
company of those that published it.

<span id="an_68:12">68:12</span> Kings of armies fled apace: and she
that tarried at home divided the spoil.

<span id="an_68:13">68:13</span> Though ye have lain among the pots, yet
shall ye be as the wings of a dove covered with silver, and her feathers
with yellow gold.

<span id="an_68:14">68:14</span> When the Almighty scattered kings in
it, it was white as snow in Salmon.

<span id="an_68:15">68:15</span> The hill of God is as the hill of
Bashan; a high hill as the hill of Bashan.

<span id="an_68:16">68:16</span> Why leap ye, ye lofty hills? this is
the hill which God desireth to dwell in; yes, the LORD will dwell in it
for ever.

<span id="an_68:17">68:17</span> The chariots of God are twenty
thousand, even thousands of angels: the Lord is among them, as in Sinai,
in the holy place.

<span id="an_68:18">68:18</span> Thou hast ascended on high, thou hast
led captivity captive: thou hast received gifts for men; yes, for the
rebellious also, that the LORD God might dwell among them.

<span id="an_68:19">68:19</span> Blessed be the Lord, who daily loadeth
us with benefits, even the God of our salvation. Selah.

<span id="an_68:20">68:20</span> He that is our God is the God of
salvation; and to GOD the Lord belong the issues from death.

<span id="an_68:21">68:21</span> But God will wound the head of his
enemies, and the hairy scalp of such one as goeth on still in his
trespasses.

<span id="an_68:22">68:22</span> The Lord said, I will bring again from
Bashan, I will bring my people again from the depths of the sea.

<span id="an_68:23">68:23</span> That thy foot may be dipped in the
blood of thy enemies, and the tongue of thy dogs in the same.

<span id="an_68:24">68:24</span> They have seen thy goings, O God; even
the goings of my God, my King, in the sanctuary.

<span id="an_68:25">68:25</span> The singers went before, the players on
instruments followed after; among them were the damsels playing with
timbrels.

<span id="an_68:26">68:26</span> Bless ye God in the congregations, even
the Lord, from the fountain of Israel.

<span id="an_68:27">68:27</span> There is little Benjamin with their
ruler, the princes of Judah and their counsel, the princes of Zebulun,
and the princes of Naphtali.

<span id="an_68:28">68:28</span> Thy God hath commanded thy strength:
strengthen, O God, that which thou hast wrought for us.

<span id="an_68:29">68:29</span> Because of thy temple at Jerusalem
shall kings bring presents to thee.

<span id="an_68:30">68:30</span> Rebuke the company of spearmen, the
multitude of the bulls, with the calves of the people, till every one
shall submit himself with pieces of silver: scatter thou the people that
delight in war.

<span id="an_68:31">68:31</span> Princes shall come out of Egypt; Cush
shall soon stretch out her hands to God.

<span id="an_68:32">68:32</span> Sing to God, ye kingdoms of the earth;
O sing praises to the Lord; Selah:

<span id="an_68:33">68:33</span> To him that rideth upon the heavens of
heavens, which were of old; lo, he doth send out his voice, and that a
mighty voice.

<span id="an_68:34">68:34</span> Ascribe ye strength to God: his
excellence is over Israel, and his strength is in the clouds.

<span id="an_68:35">68:35</span> O God, thou art terrible out of thy
holy places: the God of Israel is he that giveth strength and power to
his people. Blessed be God.

<span id="an_69:1">69:1</span> To the chief Musician upon Shoshannim, A
Psalm of David. Save me, O God; for the waters are come in to my soul.

<span id="an_69:2">69:2</span> I sink in deep mire, where there is no
standing: I am come into deep waters, where the floods overflow me.

<span id="an_69:3">69:3</span> I am weary of my crying: my throat is
dried: my eyes fail while I wait for my God.

<span id="an_69:4">69:4</span> They that hate me without a cause are
more than the hairs of my head: they that would destroy me, being my
enemies wrongfully, are mighty: then I restored that which I took not
away.

<span id="an_69:5">69:5</span> O God, thou knowest my foolishness; and
my sins are not hid from thee.

<span id="an_69:6">69:6</span> Let not them that wait on thee, O Lord
GOD of hosts, be ashamed for my sake: let not those that seek thee be
confounded for my sake, O God of Israel.

<span id="an_69:7">69:7</span> Because for thy sake I have borne
reproach; shame hath covered my face.

<span id="an_69:8">69:8</span> I am become a stranger to my brethren,
and an alien to my mother's children.

<span id="an_69:9">69:9</span> For the zeal of thy house hath eaten me
up; and the reproaches of them that reproached thee have fallen upon me.

<span id="an_69:10">69:10</span> When I wept, and chastened my soul with
fasting, that was to my reproach.

<span id="an_69:11">69:11</span> I made sackcloth also my garment; and I
became a proverb to them.

<span id="an_69:12">69:12</span> They that sit in the gate speak against
me; and I was the song of the drunkards.

<span id="an_69:13">69:13</span> But as for me, my prayer is to thee, O
LORD, in an acceptable time: O God, in the multitude of thy mercy hear
me, in the truth of thy salvation.

<span id="an_69:14">69:14</span> Deliver me out of the mire, and let me
not sink: let me be delivered from them that hate me, and out of the
deep waters.

<span id="an_69:15">69:15</span> Let not the water-flood overflow me,
neither let the deep swallow me up, and let not the pit shut her mouth
upon me.

<span id="an_69:16">69:16</span> Hear me, O LORD; for thy
loving-kindness is good: turn to me according to the multitude of thy
tender mercies.

<span id="an_69:17">69:17</span> And hide not thy face from thy servant;
for I am in trouble: hear me speedily.

<span id="an_69:18">69:18</span> Draw nigh to my soul, and redeem it:
deliver me because of my enemies.

<span id="an_69:19">69:19</span> Thou hast known my reproach, and my
shame, and my dishonor: my adversaries are all before thee.

<span id="an_69:20">69:20</span> Reproach hath broken my heart; and I am
full of heaviness: and I looked for some to take pity, but there was
none; and for comforters, but I found none.

<span id="an_69:21">69:21</span> They gave me also gall for my food; and
in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink.

<span id="an_69:22">69:22</span> Let their table become a snare before
them: and that which should have been for their welfare, let it become a
trap.

<span id="an_69:23">69:23</span> Let their eyes be darkened, that they
see not; and make their loins continually to shake.

<span id="an_69:24">69:24</span> Pour out thy indignation upon them, and
let thy wrathful anger take hold of them.

<span id="an_69:25">69:25</span> Let their habitation be desolate; and
let none dwell in their tents.

<span id="an_69:26">69:26</span> For they persecute him whom thou hast
smitten; and they talk to the grief of those whom thou hast wounded.

<span id="an_69:27">69:27</span> Add iniquity to their iniquity: and let
them not come into thy righteousness.

<span id="an_69:28">69:28</span> Let them be blotted out of the book of
the living, and not be written with the righteous.

<span id="an_69:29">69:29</span> But I am poor and sorrowful: let thy
salvation, O God, set me up on high.

<span id="an_69:30">69:30</span> I will praise the name of God with a
song, and will magnify him with thanksgiving.

<span id="an_69:31">69:31</span> This also shall please the LORD better
than an ox or bullock that hath horns and hoofs.

<span id="an_69:32">69:32</span> The humble shall see this, and be glad:
and your heart shall live that seek God.

<span id="an_69:33">69:33</span> For the LORD heareth the poor, and
despiseth not his prisoners.

<span id="an_69:34">69:34</span> Let the heaven and earth praise him,
the seas, and every thing that moveth therein.

<span id="an_69:35">69:35</span> For God will save Zion, and will build
the cities of Judah: that they may dwell there, and have it in
possession.

<span id="an_69:36">69:36</span> The seed also of his servants shall
inherit it: and they that love his name shall dwell therein.

<span id="an_70:1">70:1</span> To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David
to bring to remembrance. Make haste, O God, to deliver me; make haste to
help me, O LORD.

<span id="an_70:2">70:2</span> Let them be ashamed and confounded that
seek after my soul: let them be turned backward, and put to confusion,
that desire my hurt.

<span id="an_70:3">70:3</span> Let them be turned back for a reward of
their shame that say, Aha, aha.

<span id="an_70:4">70:4</span> Let all those that seek thee rejoice and
be glad in thee: and let such as love thy salvation say continually, Let
God be magnified.

<span id="an_70:5">70:5</span> But I am poor and needy: make haste to
me, O God: thou art my help and my deliverer; O LORD, make no delay.

<span id="an_71:1">71:1</span> In thee, O LORD, do I put my trust: let
me never be put to confusion.

<span id="an_71:2">71:2</span> Deliver me in thy righteousness, and
cause me to escape: incline thy ear to me, and save me.

<span id="an_71:3">71:3</span> Be thou my strong habitation, to which I
may continually resort: thou hast given commandment to save me; for thou
art my rock and my fortress.

<span id="an_71:4">71:4</span> Deliver me, O my God, from the hand of
the wicked, from the hand of the unrighteous and cruel man.

<span id="an_71:5">71:5</span> For thou art my hope, O Lord GOD: thou
art my trust from my youth.

<span id="an_71:6">71:6</span> By thee have I been sustained from my
birth: thou art he that brought me into life: my praise shall be
continually of thee.

<span id="an_71:7">71:7</span> I am as a wonder to many; but thou art my
strong refuge.

<span id="an_71:8">71:8</span> Let my mouth be filled with thy praise
and with thy honor all the day.

<span id="an_71:9">71:9</span> Cast me not off in the time of old age;
forsake me not when my strength faileth.

<span id="an_71:10">71:10</span> For my enemies speak against me; and
they that lay wait for my soul take counsel together,

<span id="an_71:11">71:11</span> Saying, God hath forsaken him:
persecute and take him; for there is none to deliver him.

<span id="an_71:12">71:12</span> O God, be not far from me: O my God,
make haste for my help.

<span id="an_71:13">71:13</span> Let them be confounded and consumed
that are adversaries to my soul; let them be covered with reproach and
dishonor that seek my hurt.

<span id="an_71:14">71:14</span> But I will hope continually, and will
yet praise thee more and more.

<span id="an_71:15">71:15</span> My mouth shall show forth thy
righteousness and thy salvation all the day; for I know not the numbers
thereof.

<span id="an_71:16">71:16</span> I will go in the strength of the Lord
GOD: I will make mention of thy righteousness, even of thine only.

<span id="an_71:17">71:17</span> O God, thou hast taught me from my
youth: and hitherto have I declared thy wondrous works.

<span id="an_71:18">71:18</span> Now also when I am old and gray-headed,
O God, forsake me not; until I have shown thy strength to this
generation, and thy power to every one that is to come.

<span id="an_71:19">71:19</span> Thy righteousness also, O God, is very
high, who hast done great things: O God, who is like to thee!

<span id="an_71:20">71:20</span> Thou, who hast shown me great and
severe troubles, wilt revive me again, and wilt bring me again from the
depths of the earth.

<span id="an_71:21">71:21</span> Thou wilt increase my greatness, and
comfort me on every side.

<span id="an_71:22">71:22</span> I will also praise thee with the
psaltery, even thy truth, O my God: to thee will I sing with the harp, O
thou Holy One of Israel.

<span id="an_71:23">71:23</span> My lips shall greatly rejoice when I
sing to thee; and my soul, which thou hast redeemed.

<span id="an_71:24">71:24</span> My tongue also shall talk of thy
righteousness all the day long: for they are confounded, for they are
brought to shame, that seek my hurt.

<span id="an_72:1">72:1</span> A Psalm for Solomon. Give the king thy
judgments, O God, and thy righteousness to the king's son.

<span id="an_72:2">72:2</span> He shall judge thy people with
righteousness, and thy poor with judgment.

<span id="an_72:3">72:3</span> The mountains shall bring peace to the
people, and the little hills, by righteousness.

<span id="an_72:4">72:4</span> He shall judge the poor of the people, he
shall save the children of the needy, and shall break in pieces the
oppressor.

<span id="an_72:5">72:5</span> They shall fear thee as long as the sun
and moon endure, throughout all generations.

<span id="an_72:6">72:6</span> He shall come down like rain upon the
mown grass: as showers that water the earth.

<span id="an_72:7">72:7</span> In his days shall the righteous flourish;
and abundance of peace so long as the moon endureth.

<span id="an_72:8">72:8</span> He shall have dominion also from sea to
sea, and from the river to the ends of the earth.

<span id="an_72:9">72:9</span> They that dwell in the wilderness shall
bow before him; and his enemies shall lick the dust.

<span id="an_72:10">72:10</span> The kings of Tarshish and of the isles
shall bring presents: the kings of Sheba and Seba shall offer gifts.

<span id="an_72:11">72:11</span> Yes, all kings shall fall down before
him: all nations shall serve him.

<span id="an_72:12">72:12</span> For he shall deliver the needy when he
crieth; the poor also, and him that hath no helper.

<span id="an_72:13">72:13</span> He shall spare the poor and needy, and
shall save the souls of the needy.

<span id="an_72:14">72:14</span> He shall redeem their soul from deceit
and violence: and precious shall be their blood in his sight.

<span id="an_72:15">72:15</span> And he shall live, and to him shall be
given of the gold of Sheba: prayer also shall be made for him
continually; and daily shall he be praised.

<span id="an_72:16">72:16</span> There shall be a handful of corn in the
earth upon the top of the mountains; the fruit of it shall shake like
Lebanon: and they of the city shall flourish like grass of the earth.

<span id="an_72:17">72:17</span> His name shall endure for ever: his
name shall be continued as long as the sun: and men shall be blessed in
him: all nations shall call him blessed.

<span id="an_72:18">72:18</span> Blessed be the LORD God, the God of
Israel, who only doeth wondrous things.

<span id="an_72:19">72:19</span> And blessed be his glorious name for
ever: and let the whole earth be filled with his glory; Amen, and amen.

<span id="an_72:20">72:20</span> The prayers of David the son of Jesse
are ended.

<span id="an_73:1">73:1</span> A Psalm of Asaph. Truly God is good to
Israel, even to such as are of a clean heart.

<span id="an_73:2">73:2</span> But as for me, my feet were almost gone;
my steps had well nigh slipped.

<span id="an_73:3">73:3</span> For I was envious at the foolish, when I
saw the prosperity of the wicked.

<span id="an_73:4">73:4</span> For there are no bands in their death:
but their strength is firm.

<span id="an_73:5">73:5</span> They are not in trouble as other men;
neither are they afflicted like other men.

<span id="an_73:6">73:6</span> Therefore pride encompasseth them as a
chain; violence covereth them as a garment.

<span id="an_73:7">73:7</span> Their eyes stand out with fatness: they
have more than heart could wish.

<span id="an_73:8">73:8</span> They are corrupt, and speak wickedly
concerning oppression: they speak loftily.

<span id="an_73:9">73:9</span> They set their mouth against the heavens,
and their tongue walketh through the earth.

<span id="an_73:10">73:10</span> Therefore his people return hither: and
waters of a full cup are wrung out to them.

<span id="an_73:11">73:11</span> And they say, How doth God know? and is
there knowledge in the Most High?

<span id="an_73:12">73:12</span> Behold, these are the ungodly, who
prosper in the world; they increase in riches.

<span id="an_73:13">73:13</span> Verily I have cleansed my heart in
vain, and washed my hands in innocence.

<span id="an_73:14">73:14</span> For all the day long have I been
afflicted, and chastened every morning.

<span id="an_73:15">73:15</span> If I say, I will speak thus; behold, I
should offend against the generation of thy children.

<span id="an_73:16">73:16</span> When I thought to know this, it was too
painful for me;

<span id="an_73:17">73:17</span> Until I went into the sanctuary of God;
then I understood their end.

<span id="an_73:18">73:18</span> Surely thou didst set them in slippery
places: thou didst cast them down into destruction.

<span id="an_73:19">73:19</span> How are they brought into desolation,
as in a moment! they are utterly consumed with terrors.

<span id="an_73:20">73:20</span> As a dream when one awaketh; so, O
Lord, when thou awakest, thou wilt despise their image.

<span id="an_73:21">73:21</span> Thus my heart was grieved, and I was
pricked in my reins.

<span id="an_73:22">73:22</span> So foolish was I, and ignorant: I was
as a beast before thee.

<span id="an_73:23">73:23</span> Nevertheless I am continually with
thee: thou hast held me by my right hand.

<span id="an_73:24">73:24</span> Thou wilt guide me with thy counsel,
and afterward receive me to glory.

<span id="an_73:25">73:25</span> Whom have I in heaven but thee? and
there is none upon earth that I desire besides thee.

<span id="an_73:26">73:26</span> My flesh and my heart faileth: but God
is the strength of my heart, and my portion for ever.

<span id="an_73:27">73:27</span> For lo, they that are far from thee
shall perish: thou hast destroyed all them that go astray from thee.

<span id="an_73:28">73:28</span> But it is good for me to draw near to
God: I have put my trust in the Lord GOD, that I may declare all thy
works.

<span id="an_74:1">74:1</span> Maschil of Asaph. O God, why hast thou
cast us off for ever? why doth thy anger smoke against the sheep of thy
pasture?

<span id="an_74:2">74:2</span> Remember thy congregation, which thou
hast purchased of old: the rod of thy inheritance, which thou hast
redeemed; this mount Zion, in which thou hast dwelt.

<span id="an_74:3">74:3</span> Lift up thy feet to the perpetual
desolations; even all that the enemy hath done wickedly in the
sanctuary.

<span id="an_74:4">74:4</span> Thy enemies roar in the midst of thy
congregations; they set up their ensigns for signs.

<span id="an_74:5">74:5</span> A man was famous according as he had
lifted up axes upon the thick trees.

<span id="an_74:6">74:6</span> But now they break down the carved work
of it at once with axes and hammers.

<span id="an_74:7">74:7</span> They have cast fire into thy sanctuary,
they have defiled by casting down the dwelling-place of thy name to the
ground.

<span id="an_74:8">74:8</span> They said in their hearts, Let us destroy
them together: they have burned up all the synagogues of God in the
land.

<span id="an_74:9">74:9</span> We see not our signs: there is no more
any prophet: neither is there among us any that knoweth how long.

<span id="an_74:10">74:10</span> O God, how long shall the adversary
reproach? shall the enemy blaspheme thy name for ever?

<span id="an_74:11">74:11</span> Why withdrawest thou thy hand, even thy
right hand? pluck it out of thy bosom.

<span id="an_74:12">74:12</span> For God is my King of old, working
salvation in the midst of the earth.

<span id="an_74:13">74:13</span> Thou didst divide the sea by thy
strength: thou didst break the heads of the dragons in the waters.

<span id="an_74:14">74:14</span> Thou didst break the head of leviathan
in pieces, and didst give him to be food to the people inhabiting the
wilderness.

<span id="an_74:15">74:15</span> Thou didst cleave the fountain and the
flood: thou didst dry up mighty rivers.

<span id="an_74:16">74:16</span> The day is thine, the night also is
thine: thou hast prepared the light and the sun.

<span id="an_74:17">74:17</span> Thou hast set all the borders of the
earth: thou hast made summer and winter.

<span id="an_74:18">74:18</span> Remember this, the enemy hath
reproached, O LORD, and the foolish people have blasphemed thy name.

<span id="an_74:19">74:19</span> O deliver not the soul of thy turtle
dove to the multitude of the wicked: forget not the congregation of thy
poor for ever.

<span id="an_74:20">74:20</span> Have respect to the covenant: for the
dark places of the earth are full of the habitations of cruelty.

<span id="an_74:21">74:21</span> O let not the oppressed return ashamed:
let the poor and needy praise thy name.

<span id="an_74:22">74:22</span> Arise, O God, plead thy own cause:
remember how the foolish man reproacheth thee daily.

<span id="an_74:23">74:23</span> Forget not the voice of thy enemies:
the tumult of those that rise against thee increaseth continually.

<span id="an_75:1">75:1</span> To the chief Musician, Al-taschith, A
Psalm or Song of Asaph. To thee, O God, do we give thanks, to thee do we
give thanks: for that thy name is near, thy wondrous works declare.

<span id="an_75:2">75:2</span> When I shall receive the congregation I
will judge uprightly.

<span id="an_75:3">75:3</span> The earth and all its inhabitants are
dissolved: I bear up the pillars of it. Selah.

<span id="an_75:4">75:4</span> I said to the fools, Deal not foolishly;
and to the wicked, Lift not up the horn:

<span id="an_75:5">75:5</span> Lift not up your horn on high: speak not
with a stiff neck.

<span id="an_75:6">75:6</span> For promotion cometh neither from the
east, nor from the west, nor from the south.

<span id="an_75:7">75:7</span> But God is the judge: he putteth down
one, and setteth up another.

<span id="an_75:8">75:8</span> For in the hand of the LORD there is a
cup, and the wine is red; it is full of mixture, and he poureth out of
the same: but the dregs of it all the wicked of the earth shall wring
them out, and drink them.

<span id="an_75:9">75:9</span> But I will declare for ever; I will sing
praises to the God of Jacob.

<span id="an_75:10">75:10</span> All the horns of the wicked also will I
cut off; but the horns of the righteous shall be exalted.

<span id="an_76:1">76:1</span> To the chief Musician on Neginoth, A
Psalm or Song of Asaph. In Judah is God known: his name is great in
Israel.

<span id="an_76:2">76:2</span> In Salem also is his tabernacle, and his
dwelling place in Zion.

<span id="an_76:3">76:3</span> There he broke the arrows of the bow, the
shield, and the sword, and the battle. Selah.

<span id="an_76:4">76:4</span> Thou art more glorious and excellent than
the mountains of prey.

<span id="an_76:5">76:5</span> The stout-hearted are spoiled, they have
slept their sleep: and none of the men of might have found their hands.

<span id="an_76:6">76:6</span> At thy rebuke, O God of Jacob, both the
chariot and horse are cast into a dead sleep.

<span id="an_76:7">76:7</span> Thou, even thou, art to be feared: and
who may stand in thy sight when once thou art angry?

<span id="an_76:8">76:8</span> Thou didst cause judgment to be heard
from heaven; the earth feared, and was still,

<span id="an_76:9">76:9</span> When God arose to judgment, to save all
the meek of the earth. Selah.

<span id="an_76:10">76:10</span> Surely the wrath of man shall praise
thee: the remainder of wrath wilt thou restrain.

<span id="an_76:11">76:11</span> Vow, and pay to the LORD your God: let
all that are about him bring presents to him that ought to be feared.

<span id="an_76:12">76:12</span> He shall cut off the spirit of princes:
he is terrible to the kings of the earth.

<span id="an_77:1">77:1</span> To the chief Musician, to Jeduthun, A
Psalm of Asaph. I cried to God with my voice, even to God with my voice;
and he gave ear to me.

<span id="an_77:2">77:2</span> In the day of my trouble I sought the
Lord: my sore ran in the night, and ceased not: my soul refused to be
comforted.

<span id="an_77:3">77:3</span> I remembered God, and was troubled: I
complained, and my spirit was overwhelmed. Selah.

<span id="an_77:4">77:4</span> Thou holdest my eyes waking: I am so
troubled that I cannot speak.

<span id="an_77:5">77:5</span> I have considered the days of old, the
years of ancient times.

<span id="an_77:6">77:6</span> I call to remembrance my song in the
night: I commune with my own heart: and my spirit made diligent search.

<span id="an_77:7">77:7</span> Will the Lord cast off for ever? and will
he be favorable no more?

<span id="an_77:8">77:8</span> Is his mercy wholly gone for ever? doth
his promise fail for evermore?

<span id="an_77:9">77:9</span> Hath God forgotten to be gracious? hath
he in anger shut up his tender mercies? Selah.

<span id="an_77:10">77:10</span> And I said, This is my infirmity: but I
will remember the years of the right hand of the Most High.

<span id="an_77:11">77:11</span> I will remember the works of the LORD:
surely I will remember thy wonders of old.

<span id="an_77:12">77:12</span> I will meditate also of all thy work,
and talk of thy doings.

<span id="an_77:13">77:13</span> Thy way, O God, is in the sanctuary:
who is so great a God as our God!

<span id="an_77:14">77:14</span> Thou art the God that doest wonders:
thou hast declared thy strength among the people.

<span id="an_77:15">77:15</span> Thou hast with thy arm redeemed thy
people, the sons of Jacob and Joseph. Selah.

<span id="an_77:16">77:16</span> The waters saw thee, O God, the waters
saw thee; they were afraid: the depths also were disturbed.

<span id="an_77:17">77:17</span> The clouds poured out water: the skies
sent out a sound: thy arrows also went abroad.

<span id="an_77:18">77:18</span> The voice of thy thunder was in the
heaven: the lightnings lightened the world: the earth trembled and
shook.

<span id="an_77:19">77:19</span> Thy way is in the sea, and thy path in
the great waters, and thy footsteps are not known.

<span id="an_77:20">77:20</span> Thou leddest thy people like a flock by
the hand of Moses and Aaron.

<span id="an_78:1">78:1</span> Maschil of Asaph. Give ear, O my people,
to my law: incline your ear to the words of my mouth.

<span id="an_78:2">78:2</span> I will open my mouth in a parable: I will
utter dark sayings of old:

<span id="an_78:3">78:3</span> Which we have heard and known, and our
fathers have told us.

<span id="an_78:4">78:4</span> We will not hide them from their
children, showing to the generation to come the praises of the LORD, and
his strength, and his wonderful works that he hath done.

<span id="an_78:5">78:5</span> For he established a testimony in Jacob,
and appointed a law in Israel, which he commanded our fathers, that they
should make them known to their children:

<span id="an_78:6">78:6</span> That the generation to come might know
them, even the children who should be born; who should arise and declare
them to their children:

<span id="an_78:7">78:7</span> That they might set their hope in God,
and not forget the works of God, but keep his commandments:

<span id="an_78:8">78:8</span> And might not be as their fathers, a
stubborn and rebellious generation; a generation that set not their
heart aright, and whose spirit was not steadfast with God.

<span id="an_78:9">78:9</span> The children of Ephraim, being armed, and
carrying bows, turned back in the day of battle.

<span id="an_78:10">78:10</span> They kept not the covenant of God, and
refused to walk in his law;

<span id="an_78:11">78:11</span> And forgot his works, and his wonders
that he had shown them.

<span id="an_78:12">78:12</span> Marvelous things did he in the sight of
their fathers, in the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan.

<span id="an_78:13">78:13</span> He divided the sea, and caused them to
pass through; and he made the waters to stand as a heap.

<span id="an_78:14">78:14</span> In the day-time also he led them with a
cloud, and all the night with a light of fire.

<span id="an_78:15">78:15</span> He cleaved the rocks in the wilderness,
and gave them drink as out of the great depths.

<span id="an_78:16">78:16</span> He brought streams also out of the
rock, and caused waters to run down like rivers.

<span id="an_78:17">78:17</span> And they sinned yet more against him by
provoking the Most High in the wilderness.

<span id="an_78:18">78:18</span> And they tempted God in their heart by
asking food for their desire.

<span id="an_78:19">78:19</span> Yes, they spoke against God; they said,
Can God furnish a table in the wilderness?

<span id="an_78:20">78:20</span> Behold, he smote the rock, that the
waters gushed out, and the streams overflowed; can he give bread also?
can he provide flesh for his people?

<span id="an_78:21">78:21</span> Therefore the LORD heard this, and was
wroth: so a fire was kindled against Jacob, and anger also came up
against Israel;

<span id="an_78:22">78:22</span> Because they believed not in God, and
trusted not in his salvation:

<span id="an_78:23">78:23</span> Though he had commanded the clouds from
above, and opened the doors of heaven,

<span id="an_78:24">78:24</span> And had rained down manna upon them to
eat, and had given them of the corn of heaven.

<span id="an_78:25">78:25</span> Man ate angels' food: he sent them food
to the full.

<span id="an_78:26">78:26</span> He caused an east wind to blow in the
heaven: and by his power he brought in the south wind.

<span id="an_78:27">78:27</span> He rained flesh also upon them as dust,
and feathered fowls like as the sand of the sea:

<span id="an_78:28">78:28</span> And he let it fall in the midst of
their camp, around their habitations.

<span id="an_78:29">78:29</span> So they ate, and were well filled: for
he gave them their own desire;

<span id="an_78:30">78:30</span> They were not estranged from their
desire: but while their meat was yet in their mouths,

<span id="an_78:31">78:31</span> The wrath of God came upon them, and
slew the fattest of them, and smote down the chosen men of Israel.

<span id="an_78:32">78:32</span> For all this they sinned still, and
believed not for his wondrous works.

<span id="an_78:33">78:33</span> Therefore their days did he consume in
vanity, and their years in trouble.

<span id="an_78:34">78:34</span> When he slew them, then they sought
him: and they returned and inquired early after God.

<span id="an_78:35">78:35</span> And they remembered that God was their
rock, and the high God their redeemer.

<span id="an_78:36">78:36</span> Nevertheless they flattered him with
their mouth, and they lied to him with their tongues.

<span id="an_78:37">78:37</span> For their heart was not right with him,
neither were they steadfast in his covenant.

<span id="an_78:38">78:38</span> But he, being full of compassion,
forgave their iniquity, and destroyed them not: yes, many a time he
turned his anger away, and did not stir up all his wrath.

<span id="an_78:39">78:39</span> For he remembered that they were but
flesh; a wind that passeth away, and cometh not again.

<span id="an_78:40">78:40</span> How oft did they provoke him in the
wilderness, and grieve him in the desert!

<span id="an_78:41">78:41</span> Yes, they turned back and tempted God,
and limited the Holy One of Israel.

<span id="an_78:42">78:42</span> They remembered not his hand, nor the
day when he delivered them from the enemy.

<span id="an_78:43">78:43</span> How he had wrought his signs in Egypt,
and his wonders in the field of Zoan:

<span id="an_78:44">78:44</span> And had turned their rivers into blood;
and their floods, that they could not drink.

<span id="an_78:45">78:45</span> He sent divers sorts of flies among
them, which devoured them; and frogs, which destroyed them.

<span id="an_78:46">78:46</span> He gave also their increase to the
caterpillar, and their labor to the locust.

<span id="an_78:47">78:47</span> He destroyed their vines with hail, and
their sycamore trees with frost.

<span id="an_78:48">78:48</span> He gave up their cattle also to the
hail, and their flocks to hot thunderbolts.

<span id="an_78:49">78:49</span> He cast upon them the fierceness of his
anger, wrath, and indignation, and trouble, by sending evil angels among
them.

<span id="an_78:50">78:50</span> He made a way to his anger; he spared
not their soul from death, but gave their life over to the pestilence;

<span id="an_78:51">78:51</span> And smote all the first-born in Egypt;
the chief of their strength in the tabernacles of Ham:

<span id="an_78:52">78:52</span> But made his own people to go forth
like sheep, and guided them in the wilderness like a flock.

<span id="an_78:53">78:53</span> And he led them on safely, so that they
feared not: but the sea overwhelmed their enemies.

<span id="an_78:54">78:54</span> And he brought them to the border of
his sanctuary, even to this mountain, which his right hand had
purchased.

<span id="an_78:55">78:55</span> He cast out the heathen also before
them, and divided them an inheritance by line, and made the tribes of
Israel to dwell in their tents.

<span id="an_78:56">78:56</span> Yet they tempted and provoked the most
high God, and kept not his testimonies:

<span id="an_78:57">78:57</span> But turned back, and dealt unfaithfully
like their fathers: they were turned aside like a deceitful bow.

<span id="an_78:58">78:58</span> For they provoked him to anger with
their high places, and moved him to jealousy with their graven images.

<span id="an_78:59">78:59</span> When God heard this, he was wroth, and
greatly abhorred Israel:

<span id="an_78:60">78:60</span> So that he forsook the tabernacle of
Shiloh, the tent which he placed among men;

<span id="an_78:61">78:61</span> And delivered his strength into
captivity, and his glory into the enemy's hand.

<span id="an_78:62">78:62</span> He gave over his people also to the
sword; and was wroth with his inheritance.

<span id="an_78:63">78:63</span> The fire consumed their young men; and
their maidens were not given to marriage.

<span id="an_78:64">78:64</span> Their priests fell by the sword; and
their widows made no lamentation.

<span id="an_78:65">78:65</span> Then the Lord awaked as one out of
sleep, and like a mighty man that shouteth by reason of wine.

<span id="an_78:66">78:66</span> And he smote his enemies in the hinder
part: he put them to a perpetual reproach.

<span id="an_78:67">78:67</span> Moreover he refused the tabernacle of
Joseph, and chose not the tribe of Ephraim:

<span id="an_78:68">78:68</span> But chose the tribe of Judah, the mount
Zion which he loved.

<span id="an_78:69">78:69</span> And he built his sanctuary like high
palaces, like the earth which he hath established for ever.

<span id="an_78:70">78:70</span> He chose David also his servant, and
took him from the sheep-folds:

<span id="an_78:71">78:71</span> From following the ewes great with
young he brought him to feed Jacob his people, and Israel his
inheritance.

<span id="an_78:72">78:72</span> So he fed them according to the
integrity of his heart; and guided them by the skillfulness of his
hands.

<span id="an_79:1">79:1</span> A Psalm of Asaph. O God, the heathen have
come into thy inheritance; thy holy temple have they defiled; they have
laid Jerusalem on heaps.

<span id="an_79:2">79:2</span> The dead bodies of thy servants have they
given to be food to the fowls of the heaven, the flesh of thy saints, to
the beasts of the earth.

<span id="an_79:3">79:3</span> Their blood have they shed like water
around Jerusalem; and there was none to bury them.

<span id="an_79:4">79:4</span> We have become a reproach to our
neighbors, a scorn and derision to them that are around us.

<span id="an_79:5">79:5</span> How long, LORD? wilt thou be angry for
ever? shall thy jealousy burn like fire?

<span id="an_79:6">79:6</span> Pour out thy wrath upon the heathen that
have not known thee, and upon the kingdoms that have not called upon thy
name.

<span id="an_79:7">79:7</span> For they have devoured Jacob, and laid
waste his dwelling-place.

<span id="an_79:8">79:8</span> O remember not against us former
iniquities: let thy tender mercies speedily succor us: for we are
brought very low.

<span id="an_79:9">79:9</span> Help us, O God of our salvation, for the
glory of thy name: and deliver us, and purge away our sins, for thy
name's sake.

<span id="an_79:10">79:10</span> Why should the heathen say, Where is
their God? let him be known among the heathen in our sight by avenging
the blood of thy servants which is shed.

<span id="an_79:11">79:11</span> Let the sighing of the prisoner come
before thee; according to the greatness of thy power preserve thou those
that are appointed to die;

<span id="an_79:12">79:12</span> And render to our neighbors seven-fold
into their bosom their reproach, with which they have reproached thee, O
Lord.

<span id="an_79:13">79:13</span> So we thy people and sheep of thy
pasture will give thee thanks for ever: we will show forth thy praise to
all generations.

<span id="an_80:1">80:1</span> To the chief Musician upon Shoshannim
Eduth, A Psalm of Asaph. Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel, thou that
leadest Joseph like a flock; thou that dwellest between the cherubim,
shine forth.

<span id="an_80:2">80:2</span> Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh
stir up thy strength, and come and save us.

<span id="an_80:3">80:3</span> Turn us again, O God, and cause thy face
to shine; and we shall be saved.

<span id="an_80:4">80:4</span> O LORD God of hosts, how long wilt thou
be angry against the prayer of thy people?

<span id="an_80:5">80:5</span> Thou feedest them with the bread of
tears; and givest them tears to drink in great measure.

<span id="an_80:6">80:6</span> Thou makest us a strife to our neighbors:
and our enemies laugh among themselves.

<span id="an_80:7">80:7</span> Turn us again, O God of hosts, and cause
thy face to shine; and we shall be saved.

<span id="an_80:8">80:8</span> Thou hast brought a vine out of Egypt:
thou hast cast out the heathen, and planted it.

<span id="an_80:9">80:9</span> Thou preparedst room before it, and didst
cause it to take deep root, and it filled the land.

<span id="an_80:10">80:10</span> The hills were covered with the shade
of it, and its boughs were like the goodly cedars.

<span id="an_80:11">80:11</span> She sent out her boughs to the sea, and
her branches to the river.

<span id="an_80:12">80:12</span> Why hast thou then broke down her
hedges, so that all they who pass by the way do pluck her?

<span id="an_80:13">80:13</span> The boar from the wood doth waste it,
and the wild beast of the field doth devour it.

<span id="an_80:14">80:14</span> Return, we beseech thee, O God of
hosts: look down from heaven, and behold, and visit this vine;

<span id="an_80:15">80:15</span> And the vineyard which thy right hand
planted, and the branch that thou madest strong for thyself.

<span id="an_80:16">80:16</span> It is burnt with fire, it is cut down:
they perish at the rebuke of thy countenance.

<span id="an_80:17">80:17</span> Let thy hand be upon the man of thy
right hand, upon the son of man whom thou madest strong for thyself.

<span id="an_80:18">80:18</span> So will we not go back from thee:
revive us, and we will call upon thy name.

<span id="an_80:19">80:19</span> Turn us again, O LORD God of hosts,
cause thy face to shine; and we shall be saved.

<span id="an_81:1">81:1</span> To the chief Musician upon Gittith, A
Psalm of Asaph. Sing aloud to God our strength: make a joyful noise to
the God of Jacob.

<span id="an_81:2">81:2</span> Take a psalm, and bring hither the
timbrel, the pleasant harp with the psaltery.

<span id="an_81:3">81:3</span> Blow the trumpet in the new moon, in the
time appointed, on our solemn feast day.

<span id="an_81:4">81:4</span> For this was a statute for Israel, and a
law of the God of Jacob.

<span id="an_81:5">81:5</span> This he ordained in Joseph for a
testimony, when he went out through the land of Egypt: where I heard a
language that I understood not.

<span id="an_81:6">81:6</span> I removed his shoulder from the burden:
his hands were delivered from the pots.

<span id="an_81:7">81:7</span> Thou calledst in trouble, and I delivered
thee; I answered thee in the secret place of thunder: I proved thee at
the waters of Meribah. Selah.

<span id="an_81:8">81:8</span> Hear, O my people, and I will testify to
thee; O Israel, if thou wilt hearken to me;

<span id="an_81:9">81:9</span> There shall no strange god be in thee;
neither shalt thou worship any strange god.

<span id="an_81:10">81:10</span> I am the LORD thy God who brought thee
out of the land of Egypt: open thy mouth wide, and I will fill it.

<span id="an_81:11">81:11</span> But my people would not hearken to my
voice; and Israel would not obey me.

<span id="an_81:12">81:12</span> So I gave them up to their own hearts
lust: and they walked in their own counsels.

<span id="an_81:13">81:13</span> O that my people had hearkened to me,
and Israel had walked in my ways!

<span id="an_81:14">81:14</span> I should soon have subdued their
enemies, and turned my hand against their adversaries.

<span id="an_81:15">81:15</span> The haters of the LORD should have
submitted themselves to him: and their time should have endured for
ever.

<span id="an_81:16">81:16</span> He would have fed them also with the
finest of the wheat: and with honey out of the rock I should have
satisfied thee.

<span id="an_82:1">82:1</span> A Psalm of Asaph. God standeth in the
congregation of the mighty; he judgeth among the gods.

<span id="an_82:2">82:2</span> How long will ye judge unjustly, and
accept the persons of the wicked? Selah.

<span id="an_82:3">82:3</span> Defend the poor and fatherless: do
justice to the afflicted and needy.

<span id="an_82:4">82:4</span> Deliver the poor and needy: deliver them
from the hand of the wicked.

<span id="an_82:5">82:5</span> They know not, neither will they
understand; they walk on in darkness: all the foundations of the earth
are out of course.

<span id="an_82:6">82:6</span> I have said, Ye are gods; and all of you
are children of the Most High.

<span id="an_82:7">82:7</span> But ye shall die like men, and fall like
one of the princes.

<span id="an_82:8">82:8</span> Arise, O God, judge the earth: for thou
wilt inherit all nations.

<span id="an_83:1">83:1</span> A song, or Psalm of Asaph. Keep not thou
silence, O God: hold not thy peace, and be not still, O God.

<span id="an_83:2">83:2</span> For lo, thy enemies make a tumult: and
they that hate thee have lifted up the head.

<span id="an_83:3">83:3</span> They have taken crafty counsel against
thy people, and consulted against thy hidden ones.

<span id="an_83:4">83:4</span> They have said, Come, and let us cut them
off from being a nation; that the name of Israel may be no more in
remembrance.

<span id="an_83:5">83:5</span> For they have consulted together with one
consent: they are confederate against thee,

<span id="an_83:6">83:6</span> The tabernacles of Edom, and the
Ishmaelites; of Moab, and the Hagarenes;

<span id="an_83:7">83:7</span> Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek; the
Philistines with the inhabitants of Tyre;

<span id="an_83:8">83:8</span> Assur also is joined with them: they have
helped the children of Lot. Selah.

<span id="an_83:9">83:9</span> Do to them as to the Midianites; as to
Sisera, as to Jabin, at the brook of Kison:

<span id="an_83:10">83:10</span> Who perished at En-dor: they became as
dung for the earth.

<span id="an_83:11">83:11</span> Make their nobles like Oreb, and like
Zeeb: yes, all their princes as Zebah, and as Zalmunna:

<span id="an_83:12">83:12</span> Who said, Let us take to ourselves the
houses of God in possession.

<span id="an_83:13">83:13</span> O my God, make them like a wheel; as
the stubble before the wind.

<span id="an_83:14">83:14</span> As the fire burneth a wood, and as the
flame setteth the mountains on fire;

<span id="an_83:15">83:15</span> So persecute them with thy tempest, and
make them afraid with thy storm.

<span id="an_83:16">83:16</span> Fill their faces with shame; that they
may seek thy name, O LORD.

<span id="an_83:17">83:17</span> Let them be confounded and troubled for
ever; yes, let them be put to shame, and perish:

<span id="an_83:18">83:18</span> That men may know that thou, whose name
alone is JEHOVAH, art the most high over all the earth.

<span id="an_84:1">84:1</span> To the chief Musician upon Gittith, A
Psalm for the sons of Korah. How amiable are thy tabernacles, O LORD of
hosts!

<span id="an_84:2">84:2</span> My soul longeth, and even fainteth for
the courts of the LORD: my heart and my flesh crieth out for the living
God.

<span id="an_84:3">84:3</span> Yes, the sparrow hath found a house, and
the swallow a nest for herself, where she may lay her young, even thy
altars, O LORD of hosts, my King, and my God.

<span id="an_84:4">84:4</span> Blessed are they that dwell in thy house:
they will be still praising thee. Selah.

<span id="an_84:5">84:5</span> Blessed is the man whose strength is in
thee; in whose heart are the ways of them.

<span id="an_84:6">84:6</span> Who passing through the valley of Baca
make it a well; the rain also filleth the pools.

<span id="an_84:7">84:7</span> They go from strength to strength, every
one of them in Zion appeareth before God.

<span id="an_84:8">84:8</span> O LORD God of hosts, hear my prayer: give
ear, O God of Jacob. Selah.

<span id="an_84:9">84:9</span> Behold, O God our shield, and look upon
the face of thy anointed.

<span id="an_84:10">84:10</span> For a day in thy courts is better than
a thousand. I had rather be a door-keeper in the house of my God, than
to dwell in the tents of wickedness.

<span id="an_84:11">84:11</span> For the LORD God is a sun and shield:
the LORD will give grace and glory: no good will he withhold from them
that walk uprightly.

<span id="an_84:12">84:12</span> O LORD of hosts, blessed is the man
that trusteth in thee.

<span id="an_85:1">85:1</span> To the chief Musician, A Psalm for the
sons of Korah. LORD, thou hast been favorable to thy land: thou hast
brought back the captivity of Jacob.

<span id="an_85:2">85:2</span> Thou hast forgiven the iniquity of thy
people, thou hast covered all their sin. Selah.

<span id="an_85:3">85:3</span> Thou hast taken away all thy wrath; thou
hast turned thyself from the fierceness of thy anger.

<span id="an_85:4">85:4</span> Turn us, O God of our salvation, and
cause thy anger towards us to cease.

<span id="an_85:5">85:5</span> Wilt thou be angry with us for ever? wilt
thou draw out thy anger to all generations?

<span id="an_85:6">85:6</span> Wilt thou not revive us again: that thy
people may rejoice in thee?

<span id="an_85:7">85:7</span> Show us thy mercy, O LORD, and grant us
thy salvation.

<span id="an_85:8">85:8</span> I will hear what God the LORD will speak:
for he will speak peace to his people, and to his saints: but let them
not turn again to folly.

<span id="an_85:9">85:9</span> Surely his salvation is nigh them that
fear him; that glory may dwell in our land.

<span id="an_85:10">85:10</span> Mercy and truth are met together;
righteousness and peace have kissed each other.

<span id="an_85:11">85:11</span> Truth shall spring out of the earth;
and righteousness shall look down from heaven.

<span id="an_85:12">85:12</span> Yes, the LORD will give that which is
good; and our land shall yield her increase.

<span id="an_85:13">85:13</span> Righteousness shall go before him; and
shall set us in the way of his steps.

<span id="an_86:1">86:1</span> A Prayer of David. Bow down thy ear, O
LORD, hear me: for I am poor and needy.

<span id="an_86:2">86:2</span> Preserve my soul; for I am holy: O thou
my God, save thy servant that trusteth in thee.

<span id="an_86:3">86:3</span> Be merciful to me, O Lord: for I cry to
thee daily.

<span id="an_86:4">86:4</span> Rejoice the soul of thy servant: for to
thee, O Lord, do I lift up my soul.

<span id="an_86:5">86:5</span> For thou, Lord, art good, and ready to
forgive; and abundant in mercy to all them that call upon thee.

<span id="an_86:6">86:6</span> Give ear, O LORD, to my prayer; and
attend to the voice of my supplications.

<span id="an_86:7">86:7</span> In the day of my trouble I will call upon
thee: for thou wilt answer me.

<span id="an_86:8">86:8</span> Among the gods there is none like thee, O
Lord; neither are there any works like thy works.

<span id="an_86:9">86:9</span> All nations whom thou hast made shall
come and worship before thee, O Lord; and shall glorify thy name.

<span id="an_86:10">86:10</span> For thou art great, and doest wondrous
things: thou art God alone.

<span id="an_86:11">86:11</span> Teach me thy way, O LORD; I will walk
in thy truth: unite my heart to fear thy name.

<span id="an_86:12">86:12</span> I will praise thee, O Lord my God, with
all my heart: and I will glorify thy name for evermore.

<span id="an_86:13">86:13</span> For great is thy mercy towards me: and
thou hast delivered my soul from the lowest hell.

<span id="an_86:14">86:14</span> O God, the proud have risen against me,
and the assemblies of violent men have sought after my soul; and have
not set thee before them.

<span id="an_86:15">86:15</span> But thou, O Lord, art a God full of
compassion, and gracious; long-suffering, and abundant in mercy and
truth.

<span id="an_86:16">86:16</span> O turn to me, and have mercy upon me;
give thy strength to thy servant, and save the son of thy handmaid.

<span id="an_86:17">86:17</span> Show me a token for good; that they who
hate me may see it, and be ashamed: because thou, LORD, hast helped me,
and comforted me.

<span id="an_87:1">87:1</span> A Psalm or Song for the sons of Korah.
His foundation is in the holy mountains.

<span id="an_87:2">87:2</span> The LORD loveth the gates of Zion more
than all the dwellings of Jacob.

<span id="an_87:3">87:3</span> Glorious things are spoken of thee, O
city of God. Selah.

<span id="an_87:4">87:4</span> I will make mention of Rahab and Babylon
to them that know me: behold Philistia, and Tyre, with Cush; this man
was born there.

<span id="an_87:5">87:5</span> And of Zion it shall be said, This and
that man was born in her: and the Highest himself shall establish her.

<span id="an_87:6">87:6</span> The LORD shall count, when he writeth up
the people, that this man was born there. Selah.

<span id="an_87:7">87:7</span> As well the singers as the players on
instruments shall be there: all my springs are in thee.

<span id="an_88:1">88:1</span> A Song or Psalm for the sons of Korah, to
the chief Musician upon Mahalath Leannoth, Maschil of Heman the
Ezrahite. O LORD God of my salvation, I have cried day and night before
thee:

<span id="an_88:2">88:2</span> Let my prayer come before thee: incline
thy ear to my cry;

<span id="an_88:3">88:3</span> For my soul is full of troubles: and my
life draweth nigh to the grave.

<span id="an_88:4">88:4</span> I am counted with them that go down into
the pit: I am as a man that hath no strength:

<span id="an_88:5">88:5</span> Free among the dead, like the slain that
lie in the grave, whom thou rememberest no more: and they are cut off
from thy hand.

<span id="an_88:6">88:6</span> Thou hast laid me in the lowest pit, in
darkness, in the deeps.

<span id="an_88:7">88:7</span> Thy wrath lieth hard upon me, and thou
hast afflicted me with all thy waves. Selah.

<span id="an_88:8">88:8</span> Thou hast put away my acquaintance far
from me; thou hast made me an abomination to them: I am shut up, and I
cannot come forth.

<span id="an_88:9">88:9</span> My eye mourneth by reason of affliction:
LORD, I have called daily upon thee, I have stretched out my hands to
thee.

<span id="an_88:10">88:10</span> Wilt thou show wonders to the dead?
shall the dead arise and praise thee? Selah.

<span id="an_88:11">88:11</span> Shall thy loving-kindness be declared
in the grave? or thy faithfulness in destruction?

<span id="an_88:12">88:12</span> Shall thy wonders be known in the dark?
and thy righteousness in the land of forgetfulness?

<span id="an_88:13">88:13</span> But to thee have I cried, O LORD; and
in the morning shall my prayer come before thee.

<span id="an_88:14">88:14</span> LORD, why castest thou off my soul? why
hidest thou thy face from me?

<span id="an_88:15">88:15</span> I am afflicted and ready to die from my
youth up: while I suffer thy terrors I am distracted.

<span id="an_88:16">88:16</span> Thy fierce wrath goeth over me; thy
terrors have cut me off.

<span id="an_88:17">88:17</span> They came around me daily like water;
they encompassed me together.

<span id="an_88:18">88:18</span> Lover and friend hast thou put far from
me, and my acquaintance into darkness.

<span id="an_89:1">89:1</span> Maschil of Ethan the Ezrahite. I will
sing of the mercies of the LORD for ever: with my mouth will I make
known thy faithfulness to all generations.

<span id="an_89:2">89:2</span> For I have said, Mercy shall be built up
for ever: thy faithfulness wilt thou establish in the very heavens.

<span id="an_89:3">89:3</span> I have made a covenant with my chosen, I
have sworn to David my servant,

<span id="an_89:4">89:4</span> Thy seed will I establish for ever, and
build up thy throne to all generations. Selah.

<span id="an_89:5">89:5</span> And the heavens shall praise thy wonders,
O LORD; thy faithfulness also in the congregation of the saints.

<span id="an_89:6">89:6</span> For who in the heaven can be compared to
the LORD? who among the sons of the mighty can be likened to the LORD?

<span id="an_89:7">89:7</span> God is greatly to be feared in the
assembly of the saints, and to be had in reverence by all them that are
about him.

<span id="an_89:8">89:8</span> O LORD God of hosts, who is a strong LORD
like to thee? or to thy faithfulness around thee?

<span id="an_89:9">89:9</span> Thou rulest the raging of the sea: when
its waves arise, thou stillest them.

<span id="an_89:10">89:10</span> Thou hast broken Rahab in pieces, as
one that is slain; thou hast scattered thy enemies with thy strong arm.

<span id="an_89:11">89:11</span> The heavens are thine, the earth also
is thine: as for the world, and the fullness of it, thou hast founded
them.

<span id="an_89:12">89:12</span> The north and the south thou hast
created them: Tabor and Hermon shall rejoice in thy name.

<span id="an_89:13">89:13</span> Thou hast a mighty arm: strong is thy
hand, and high is thy right hand.

<span id="an_89:14">89:14</span> Justice and judgment are the habitation
of thy throne: mercy and truth shall go before thy face.

<span id="an_89:15">89:15</span> Blessed are the people that know the
joyful sound: they shall walk, O LORD, in the light of thy countenance.

<span id="an_89:16">89:16</span> In thy name shall they rejoice all the
day: and in thy righteousness shall they be exalted.

<span id="an_89:17">89:17</span> For thou art the glory of their
strength: and in thy favor our horn shall be exalted.

<span id="an_89:18">89:18</span> For the LORD is our defense; and the
Holy One of Israel is our king.

<span id="an_89:19">89:19</span> Then thou didst speak in vision to thy
holy one, and say, I have laid help upon one that is mighty; I have
exalted one chosen out of the people.

<span id="an_89:20">89:20</span> I have found David my servant; with my
holy oil have I anointed him:

<span id="an_89:21">89:21</span> With whom my hand shall be established:
my arm also shall strengthen him.

<span id="an_89:22">89:22</span> The enemy shall not exact upon him; nor
the son of wickedness afflict him.

<span id="an_89:23">89:23</span> And I will beat down his foes before
his face, and afflict them that hate him.

<span id="an_89:24">89:24</span> But my faithfulness and my mercy shall
be with him: and in my name shall his horn be exalted.

<span id="an_89:25">89:25</span> I will set his hand also in the sea,
and his right hand in the rivers.

<span id="an_89:26">89:26</span> He shall cry to me, Thou art my father,
my God, and the rock of my salvation.

<span id="an_89:27">89:27</span> Also I will make him my first-born,
higher than the kings of the earth.

<span id="an_89:28">89:28</span> My mercy will I keep for him for
evermore, and my covenant shall stand fast with him.

<span id="an_89:29">89:29</span> His seed also will I make to endure for
ever, and his throne as the days of heaven.

<span id="an_89:30">89:30</span> If his children forsake my law, and
walk not in my judgments;

<span id="an_89:31">89:31</span> If they break my statutes, and keep not
my commandments;

<span id="an_89:32">89:32</span> Then will I visit their transgression
with the rod, and their iniquity with stripes.

<span id="an_89:33">89:33</span> Nevertheless my loving-kindness will I
not utterly take from him, nor suffer my faithfulness to fail.

<span id="an_89:34">89:34</span> My covenant will I not break, nor alter
the thing that hath gone out of my lips.

<span id="an_89:35">89:35</span> Once have I sworn by my holiness that I
will not lie to David.

<span id="an_89:36">89:36</span> His seed shall endure for ever, and his
throne as the sun before me.

<span id="an_89:37">89:37</span> It shall be established for ever as the
moon, and as a faithful witness in heaven. Selah.

<span id="an_89:38">89:38</span> But thou hast cast off and abhorred,
thou hast been wroth with thy anointed.

<span id="an_89:39">89:39</span> Thou hast made void the covenant of thy
servant: thou hast profaned his crown by casting it to the ground.

<span id="an_89:40">89:40</span> Thou hast broken down all his hedges;
thou hast brought his strong holds to ruin.

<span id="an_89:41">89:41</span> All that pass by the way plunder him:
he is a reproach to his neighbors.

<span id="an_89:42">89:42</span> Thou hast set up the right hand of his
adversaries; thou hast made all his enemies to rejoice.

<span id="an_89:43">89:43</span> Thou hast also turned the edge of his
sword, and hast not made him to stand in the battle.

<span id="an_89:44">89:44</span> Thou hast made his glory to cease, and
cast his throne down to the ground.

<span id="an_89:45">89:45</span> The days of his youth hast thou
shortened: thou hast covered him with shame. Selah.

<span id="an_89:46">89:46</span> How long, LORD, wilt thou hide thyself?
for ever? shall thy wrath burn like fire?

<span id="an_89:47">89:47</span> Remember how short my time is: why hast
thou made all men in vain?

<span id="an_89:48">89:48</span> What man is he that liveth, and shall
not see death? shall he deliver his soul from the hand of the grave?
Selah.

<span id="an_89:49">89:49</span> Lord, where are thy former
loving-kindnesses, which thou didst swear to David in thy truth?

<span id="an_89:50">89:50</span> Remember, Lord, the reproach of thy
servants; how I do bear in my bosom the reproach of all the mighty
people;

<span id="an_89:51">89:51</span> With which thy enemies have reproached,
O LORD; with which they have reproached the footsteps of thy anointed

<span id="an_89:52">89:52</span> Blessed be the LORD for evermore. Amen
and amen.

<span id="an_90:1">90:1</span> A prayer of Moses the man of God. Lord,
thou hast been our dwelling-place in all generations.

<span id="an_90:2">90:2</span> Before the mountains were brought forth,
or ever thou hadst formed the earth and the world, even from everlasting
to everlasting, thou art God.

<span id="an_90:3">90:3</span> Thou turnest man to destruction; and
sayest, Return, ye children of men.

<span id="an_90:4">90:4</span> For a thousand years in thy sight are but
as yesterday when it is past, and as a watch in the night.

<span id="an_90:5">90:5</span> Thou carriest them away as with a flood;
they are as a sleep; in the morning they are like grass which groweth.

<span id="an_90:6">90:6</span> In the morning it flourisheth, and
groweth; in the evening it is cut down, and withereth.

<span id="an_90:7">90:7</span> For we are consumed by thy anger, and by
thy wrath are we troubled.

<span id="an_90:8">90:8</span> Thou hast set our iniquities before thee,
our secret sins in the light of thy countenance.

<span id="an_90:9">90:9</span> For all our days are passed away in thy
wrath: we spend our years, as a tale that is told.

<span id="an_90:10">90:10</span> The days of our years are seventy
years; and if by reason of strength they are eighty years, yet is their
strength labor and sorrow; for it is soon cut off, and we fly away.

<span id="an_90:11">90:11</span> Who knoweth the power of thy anger?
even according to thy fear, so is thy wrath.

<span id="an_90:12">90:12</span> So teach us to number our days, that we
may apply our hearts to wisdom.

<span id="an_90:13">90:13</span> Return, O LORD, how long? and repent
thou concerning thy servants.

<span id="an_90:14">90:14</span> O satisfy us early with thy mercy; that
we may rejoice and be glad all our days.

<span id="an_90:15">90:15</span> Make us glad according to the days in
which thou hast afflicted us, and the years in which we have seen evil.

<span id="an_90:16">90:16</span> Let thy work appear to thy servants,
and thy glory to their children.

<span id="an_90:17">90:17</span> And let the beauty of the LORD our God
be upon us: and establish thou the work of our hands upon us; yes, the
work of our hands establish thou it.

<span id="an_91:1">91:1</span> He that dwelleth in the secret place of
the Most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty.

<span id="an_91:2">91:2</span> I will say of the LORD, He is my refuge
and my fortress: my God; in him will I trust.

<span id="an_91:3">91:3</span> Surely he shall deliver thee from the
snare of the fowler, and from the noisome pestilence.

<span id="an_91:4">91:4</span> He shall cover thee with his feathers,
and under his wings shalt thou trust: his truth shall be thy shield and
buckler.

<span id="an_91:5">91:5</span> Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror
by night; nor for the arrow that flieth by day;

<span id="an_91:6">91:6</span> Nor for the pestilence that walketh in
darkness; nor for the destruction that wasteth at noon-day.

<span id="an_91:7">91:7</span> A thousand shall fall at thy side, and
ten thousand at thy right hand; but it shall not come nigh thee.

<span id="an_91:8">91:8</span> Only with thy eyes shalt thou behold and
see the reward of the wicked.

<span id="an_91:9">91:9</span> Because thou hast made the LORD who is my
refuge, even the Most High, thy habitation;

<span id="an_91:10">91:10</span> There shall no evil befall thee,
neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling.

<span id="an_91:11">91:11</span> For he shall give his angels charge
over thee, to keep thee in all thy ways.

<span id="an_91:12">91:12</span> They shall bear thee up in their hands,
lest thou dash thy foot against a stone.

<span id="an_91:13">91:13</span> Thou shalt tread upon the lion and
adder: the young lion and the dragon shalt thou trample under feet.

<span id="an_91:14">91:14</span> Because he hath set his love upon me,
therefore will I deliver him: I will set him on high, because he hath
known my name.

<span id="an_91:15">91:15</span> He shall call upon me, and I will
answer him: I will be with him in trouble; I will deliver him, and honor
him.

<span id="an_91:16">91:16</span> With long life will I satisfy him, and
show him my salvation.

<span id="an_92:1">92:1</span> A Psalm or Song for the sabbath day. It
is a good thing to give thanks to the LORD, and to sing praises to thy
name, O Most High.

<span id="an_92:2">92:2</span> To show forth thy loving-kindness in the
morning, and thy faithfulness every night.

<span id="an_92:3">92:3</span> Upon an instrument of ten strings, and
upon the psaltery; upon the harp with a solemn sound.

<span id="an_92:4">92:4</span> For thou, LORD, hast made me glad through
thy work: I will triumph in the works of thy hands.

<span id="an_92:5">92:5</span> O LORD, how great are thy works! and thy
thoughts are very deep.

<span id="an_92:6">92:6</span> A brutish man knoweth not; neither doth a
fool understand this.

<span id="an_92:7">92:7</span> When the wicked spring as the grass, and
when all the workers of iniquity do flourish; it is that they shall be
destroyed for ever:

<span id="an_92:8">92:8</span> But thou, LORD, art most high for
evermore.

<span id="an_92:9">92:9</span> For lo, thy enemies, O LORD, for lo, thy
enemies shall perish; all the workers of iniquity shall be scattered.

<span id="an_92:10">92:10</span> But my horn shalt thou exalt like the
horn of an unicorn: I shall be anointed with fresh oil.

<span id="an_92:11">92:11</span> My eye also shall see my desire on my
enemies, and my ears shall hear my desire of the wicked that rise up
against me.

<span id="an_92:12">92:12</span> The righteous shall flourish like the
palm-tree; he shall grow like a cedar in Lebanon.

<span id="an_92:13">92:13</span> Those that are planted in the house of
the LORD shall flourish in the courts of our God.

<span id="an_92:14">92:14</span> They shall still bring forth fruit in
old age; they shall be fat and flourishing;

<span id="an_92:15">92:15</span> To show that the LORD is upright: he is
my rock, and there is no unrighteousness in him.

<span id="an_93:1">93:1</span> The LORD reigneth, he is clothed with
majesty; the LORD is clothed with strength, with which he hath girded
himself: the world also is established, that it cannot be moved.

<span id="an_93:2">93:2</span> Thy throne is established of old: thou
art from everlasting.

<span id="an_93:3">93:3</span> The floods have lifted up, O LORD, the
floods have lifted up their voice; the floods lift their waves.

<span id="an_93:4">93:4</span> The LORD on high is mightier than the
noise of many waters, yes, than the mighty waves of the sea.

<span id="an_93:5">93:5</span> Thy testimonies are very sure: holiness
becometh thy house, O LORD, for ever.

<span id="an_94:1">94:1</span> O LORD God, to whom vengeance belongeth;
O God, to whom vengeance belongeth, show thyself.

<span id="an_94:2">94:2</span> Lift up thyself, thou judge of the earth:
render a reward to the proud.

<span id="an_94:3">94:3</span> LORD, how long shall the wicked, how long
shall the wicked triumph?

<span id="an_94:4">94:4</span> How long shall they utter and speak hard
things? and all the workers of iniquity boast themselves?

<span id="an_94:5">94:5</span> They break in pieces thy people, O LORD,
and afflict thy heritage.

<span id="an_94:6">94:6</span> They slay the widow and the stranger, and
murder the fatherless.

<span id="an_94:7">94:7</span> Yet they say, The LORD will not see,
neither will the God of Jacob regard it.

<span id="an_94:8">94:8</span> Understand, ye brutish among the people:
and ye fools, when will ye be wise?

<span id="an_94:9">94:9</span> He that planted the ear, shall he not
hear? he that formed the eye, shall he not see?

<span id="an_94:10">94:10</span> He that chastiseth the heathen, shall
he not correct? he that teacheth man knowledge, shall he not know?

<span id="an_94:11">94:11</span> The LORD knoweth the thoughts of man,
that they are vanity.

<span id="an_94:12">94:12</span> Blessed is the man whom thou
chastenest, O LORD, and teachest him out of thy law;

<span id="an_94:13">94:13</span> That thou mayest give him rest from the
days of adversity, until the pit be digged for the wicked.

<span id="an_94:14">94:14</span> For the LORD will not cast off his
people, neither will he forsake his inheritance.

<span id="an_94:15">94:15</span> But judgment shall return to
righteousness: and all the upright in heart shall follow it.

<span id="an_94:16">94:16</span> Who will rise up for me against the
evil-doers? or who will stand up for me against the workers of iniquity?

<span id="an_94:17">94:17</span> Unless the LORD had been my help, my
soul had almost dwelt in silence.

<span id="an_94:18">94:18</span> When I said, My foot slippeth; thy
mercy, O LORD, held me up.

<span id="an_94:19">94:19</span> In the multitude of my thoughts within
me, thy comforts delight my soul.

<span id="an_94:20">94:20</span> Shall the throne of iniquity have
fellowship with thee, which frameth mischief by a law?

<span id="an_94:21">94:21</span> They assemble themselves against the
soul of the righteous, and condemn the innocent blood.

<span id="an_94:22">94:22</span> But the LORD is my defense; and my God
is the rock of my refuge.

<span id="an_94:23">94:23</span> And he will bring upon them their own
iniquity, and will cut them off in their own wickedness; yes, the LORD
our God will cut them off.

<span id="an_95:1">95:1</span> O come, let us sing to the LORD: let us
make a joyful noise to the rock of our salvation.

<span id="an_95:2">95:2</span> Let us come before his presence with
thanksgiving, and make a joyful noise to him with psalms.

<span id="an_95:3">95:3</span> For the LORD is a great God, and a great
King above all gods.

<span id="an_95:4">95:4</span> In his hand are the deep places of the
earth: the strength of the hills is his also.

<span id="an_95:5">95:5</span> The sea is his, and he made it: and his
hands formed the dry land.

<span id="an_95:6">95:6</span> O come, let us worship and bow down: let
us kneel before the LORD our maker.

<span id="an_95:7">95:7</span> For he is our God; and we are the people
of his pasture, and the sheep of his hand. To-day, if ye will hear his
voice,

<span id="an_95:8">95:8</span> Harden not your heart, as in the
provocation, and as in the day of temptation in the wilderness:

<span id="an_95:9">95:9</span> When your fathers tempted me, proved me,
and saw my work.

<span id="an_95:10">95:10</span> Forty years long was I grieved with
this generation, and said, It is a people that do err in their heart,
and they have not known my ways:

<span id="an_95:11">95:11</span> To whom I swore in my wrath, that they
should not enter into my rest.

<span id="an_96:1">96:1</span> O sing to the LORD a new song: sing to
the LORD, all the earth.

<span id="an_96:2">96:2</span> Sing to the LORD, bless his name; show
forth his salvation from day to day.

<span id="an_96:3">96:3</span> Declare his glory among the heathen, his
wonders among all people.

<span id="an_96:4">96:4</span> For the LORD is great, and greatly to be
praised: he is to be feared above all gods.

<span id="an_96:5">96:5</span> For all the gods of the nations are
idols: but the LORD made the heavens.

<span id="an_96:6">96:6</span> Honor and majesty are before him:
strength and beauty are in his sanctuary.

<span id="an_96:7">96:7</span> Give to the LORD, O ye kindreds of the
people, give to the LORD glory and strength.

<span id="an_96:8">96:8</span> Give to the LORD the glory due to his
name: bring an offering, and come into his courts.

<span id="an_96:9">96:9</span> O worship the LORD in the beauty of
holiness: fear before him, all the earth.

<span id="an_96:10">96:10</span> Say among the heathen that the LORD
reigneth: the world also shall be established that it shall not be
moved: he will judge the people righteously.

<span id="an_96:11">96:11</span> Let the heavens rejoice, and let the
earth be glad; let the sea roar, and the fullness of it.

<span id="an_96:12">96:12</span> Let the field be joyful, and all that
is in it: then shall all the trees of the wood rejoice before the LORD:

<span id="an_96:13">96:13</span> For he cometh, for he cometh to judge
the earth: he will judge the world with righteousness, and the people
with his truth.

<span id="an_97:1">97:1</span> The LORD reigneth; let the earth rejoice;
let the multitude of isles be glad.

<span id="an_97:2">97:2</span> Clouds and darkness surround him:
righteousness and judgment are the habitation of his throne.

<span id="an_97:3">97:3</span> A fire goeth before him, and burneth up
his enemies round about.

<span id="an_97:4">97:4</span> His lightnings enlightened the world: the
earth saw, and trembled.

<span id="an_97:5">97:5</span> The hills melted like wax at the presence
of the LORD, at the presence of the Lord of the whole earth.

<span id="an_97:6">97:6</span> The heavens declare his righteousness,
and all the people see his glory.

<span id="an_97:7">97:7</span> Confounded be all they that serve graven
images, that boast themselves of idols; worship him, all ye gods.

<span id="an_97:8">97:8</span> Zion heard, and was glad; and the
daughters of Judah rejoiced because of thy judgments, O LORD.

<span id="an_97:9">97:9</span> For thou, LORD, art high above all the
earth: thou art exalted far above all gods.

<span id="an_97:10">97:10</span> Ye that love the LORD, hate evil: he
preserveth the souls of his saints; he delivereth them out of the hand
of the wicked.

<span id="an_97:11">97:11</span> Light is sown for the righteous, and
gladness for the upright in heart.

<span id="an_97:12">97:12</span> Rejoice in the LORD, ye righteous; and
give thanks at the remembrance of his holiness.

<span id="an_98:1">98:1</span> A Psalm. O sing to the LORD a new song;
for he hath done marvelous things: his right hand, and his holy arm,
hath gotten him the victory.

<span id="an_98:2">98:2</span> The LORD hath made known his salvation:
his righteousness hath he openly shown in the sight of the heathen.

<span id="an_98:3">98:3</span> He hath remembered his mercy and his
truth towards the house of Israel: all the ends of the earth have seen
the salvation of our God.

<span id="an_98:4">98:4</span> Make a joyful noise to the LORD, all the
earth: make a loud noise, and rejoice, and sing praise.

<span id="an_98:5">98:5</span> Sing to the LORD with the harp; with the
harp, and the voice of a psalm.

<span id="an_98:6">98:6</span> With trumpets and sound of cornet make a
joyful noise before the LORD, the King.

<span id="an_98:7">98:7</span> Let the sea roar, and the fullness of it,
the world, and they that dwell therein.

<span id="an_98:8">98:8</span> Let the floods clap their hands: let the
hills be joyful together

<span id="an_98:9">98:9</span> Before the LORD; for he cometh to judge
the earth: with righteousness will he judge the world, and the people
with equity.

<span id="an_99:1">99:1</span> The LORD reigneth; let the people
tremble: he setteth between the cherubim; let the earth be moved.

<span id="an_99:2">99:2</span> The LORD is great in Zion; and he is high
above all people.

<span id="an_99:3">99:3</span> Let them praise thy great and terrible
name; for it is holy.

<span id="an_99:4">99:4</span> The king's strength also loveth judgment;
thou dost establish equity, thou executest judgment and righteousness in
Jacob.

<span id="an_99:5">99:5</span> Exalt ye the LORD our God, and worship at
his footstool; for he is holy.

<span id="an_99:6">99:6</span> Moses and Aaron among his priests, and
Samuel among them that call upon his name; they called upon the LORD,
and he answered them.

<span id="an_99:7">99:7</span> He spoke to them in the cloudy pillar:
they kept his testimonies, and the ordinance that he gave them.

<span id="an_99:8">99:8</span> Thou didst answer them, O LORD our God:
thou wast a God that forgavest them, though thou tookest vengeance of
their inventions.

<span id="an_99:9">99:9</span> Exalt the LORD our God, and worship at
his holy hill; for the LORD our God is holy.

<span id="an_100:1">100:1</span> A Psalm of praise. Make a joyful noise
to the LORD, all ye lands.

<span id="an_100:2">100:2</span> Serve the LORD with gladness: come
before his presence with singing.

<span id="an_100:3">100:3</span> Know ye that the LORD he is God: it is
he that hath made us, and not we ourselves; we are his people, and the
sheep of his pasture.

<span id="an_100:4">100:4</span> Enter into his gates with thanksgiving,
and into his courts with praise: be thankful to him, and bless his name.

<span id="an_100:5">100:5</span> For the LORD is good; his mercy is
everlasting; and his truth endureth to all generations.

<span id="an_101:1">101:1</span> A Psalm of David. I will sing of mercy
and judgment: to thee, O LORD, will I sing.

<span id="an_101:2">101:2</span> I will behave myself wisely in a
perfect way. O when wilt thou come to me? I will walk within my house
with a perfect heart.

<span id="an_101:3">101:3</span> I will set no wicked thing before my
eyes: I hate the work of them that turn aside; it shall not cleave to
me.

<span id="an_101:4">101:4</span> A froward heart shall depart from me: I
will not know a wicked person.

<span id="an_101:5">101:5</span> Whoever privily slandereth his
neighbor, him will I cut off: him that hath a high look and a proud
heart I will not suffer.

<span id="an_101:6">101:6</span> My eyes shall be upon the faithful of
the land, that they may dwell with me: he that walketh in a perfect way,
he shall serve me.

<span id="an_101:7">101:7</span> He that worketh deceit shall not dwell
within my house: he that telleth lies shall not tarry in my sight.

<span id="an_101:8">101:8</span> I will early destroy all the wicked of
the land; that I may cut off all who practice wickedness from the city
of the LORD.

<span id="an_102:1">102:1</span> A Prayer of the afflicted, when he is
overwhelmed, and poureth out his complaint before the LORD. Hear my
prayer, O LORD, and let my cry come to thee.

<span id="an_102:2">102:2</span> Hide not thy face from me in the day
when I am in trouble; incline thy ear to me: in the day when I call,
answer me speedily.

<span id="an_102:3">102:3</span> For my days are consumed like smoke,
and my bones are burned as an hearth.

<span id="an_102:4">102:4</span> My heart is smitten, and withered like
grass; so that I forget to eat my bread.

<span id="an_102:5">102:5</span> By reason of the voice of my groaning,
my bones cleave to my skin.

<span id="an_102:6">102:6</span> I am like a pelican of the wilderness:
I am like an owl of the desert.

<span id="an_102:7">102:7</span> I watch, and am as a sparrow alone upon
the house top.

<span id="an_102:8">102:8</span> My enemies reproach me all the day; and
they that are enraged against me are sworn against me.

<span id="an_102:9">102:9</span> For I have eaten ashes like bread, and
mingled my drink with weeping,

<span id="an_102:10">102:10</span> Because of thy indignation and thy
wrath: for thou hast lifted me up, and cast me down.

<span id="an_102:11">102:11</span> My days are like a shadow that
declineth; and I am withered like grass.

<span id="an_102:12">102:12</span> But thou, O LORD, shalt endure for
ever; and thy remembrance to all generations.

<span id="an_102:13">102:13</span> Thou shalt arise, and have mercy upon
Zion: for the time to favor her, yes, the set time, is come.

<span id="an_102:14">102:14</span> For thy servants take pleasure in her
stones, and favor the dust thereof.

<span id="an_102:15">102:15</span> So the heathen shall fear the name of
the LORD: and all the kings of the earth thy glory.

<span id="an_102:16">102:16</span> When the LORD shall build up Zion, he
will appear in his glory.

<span id="an_102:17">102:17</span> He will regard the prayer of the
destitute, and not despise their prayer.

<span id="an_102:18">102:18</span> This shall be written for the
generation to come: and the people which shall be created shall praise
the LORD.

<span id="an_102:19">102:19</span> For he hath looked down from the
hight of his sanctuary; from heaven hath the LORD beheld the earth;

<span id="an_102:20">102:20</span> To hear the groaning of the prisoner;
to loose those that are appointed to death;

<span id="an_102:21">102:21</span> To declare the name of the LORD in
Zion, and his praise in Jerusalem;

<span id="an_102:22">102:22</span> When the people are assembled, and
the kingdoms, to serve the LORD.

<span id="an_102:23">102:23</span> He weakened my strength in the way;
he shortened my days.

<span id="an_102:24">102:24</span> I said, O my God, take me not away in
the midst of my days: thy years are throughout all generations.

<span id="an_102:25">102:25</span> Of old hast thou laid the foundation
of the earth: and the heavens are the work of thy hands.

<span id="an_102:26">102:26</span> They shall perish, but thou wilt
endure: yes, all of them shall grow old like a garment; as a vesture
wilt thou change them, and they shall be changed:

<span id="an_102:27">102:27</span> But thou art the same, and thy years
will have no end.

<span id="an_102:28">102:28</span> The children of thy servants shall
continue, and their seed shall be established before thee.

<span id="an_103:1">103:1</span> A Psalm of David. Bless the LORD, O my
soul: and all that is within me, bless his holy name.

<span id="an_103:2">103:2</span> Bless the LORD, O my soul, and forget
not all his benefits:

<span id="an_103:3">103:3</span> Who forgiveth all thy iniquities; who
healeth all thy diseases;

<span id="an_103:4">103:4</span> Who redeemeth thy life from
destruction; who crowneth thee with loving-kindness and tender mercies;

<span id="an_103:5">103:5</span> Who satisfieth thy mouth with good
things; so that thy youth is renewed like the eagle's.

<span id="an_103:6">103:6</span> The LORD executeth righteousness and
judgment for all that are oppressed.

<span id="an_103:7">103:7</span> He made known his ways to Moses, his
acts to the children of Israel.

<span id="an_103:8">103:8</span> The LORD is merciful and gracious, slow
to anger, and abundant in mercy.

<span id="an_103:9">103:9</span> He will not always chide: neither will
he keep his anger for ever.

<span id="an_103:10">103:10</span> He hath not dealt with us according
to our sins; nor rewarded us according to our iniquities.

<span id="an_103:11">103:11</span> For as the heaven is high above the
earth, so great is his mercy towards them that fear him.

<span id="an_103:12">103:12</span> As far as the east is from the west,
so far hath he removed our transgressions from us.

<span id="an_103:13">103:13</span> Like as a father pitieth his
children, so the LORD pitieth them that fear him.

<span id="an_103:14">103:14</span> For he knoweth our frame; he
remembereth that we are dust.

<span id="an_103:15">103:15</span> As for man, his days are as grass: as
a flower of the field, so he flourisheth.

<span id="an_103:16">103:16</span> For the wind passeth over it, and it
is gone; and its place shall know it no more.

<span id="an_103:17">103:17</span> But the mercy of the LORD is from
everlasting to everlasting upon them that fear him, and his
righteousness to children's children;

<span id="an_103:18">103:18</span> To such as keep his covenant, and to
those that remember his commandments to do them.

<span id="an_103:19">103:19</span> The LORD hath prepared his throne in
the heavens; and his kingdom ruleth over all.

<span id="an_103:20">103:20</span> Bless the LORD, ye his angels, that
excel in strength, that do his commandments, hearkening to the voice of
his word.

<span id="an_103:21">103:21</span> Bless ye the LORD, all ye his hosts;
ye ministers of his, that do his pleasure.

<span id="an_103:22">103:22</span> Bless the LORD, all his works in all
places of his dominion: bless the LORD, O my soul.

<span id="an_104:1">104:1</span> Bless the LORD, O my soul. O LORD my
God, thou art very great; thou art clothed with honor and majesty.

<span id="an_104:2">104:2</span> Who coverest thyself with light as with
a garment: who stretchest out the heavens like a curtain:

<span id="an_104:3">104:3</span> Who layeth the beams of his chambers in
the waters: who maketh the clouds his chariot: who walketh upon the
wings of the wind:

<span id="an_104:4">104:4</span> Who maketh his angels spirits; his
ministers a flaming fire:

<span id="an_104:5">104:5</span> Who laid the foundations of the earth,
that it should not be removed for ever.

<span id="an_104:6">104:6</span> Thou coveredst it with the deep as with
a garment: the waters stood above the mountains.

<span id="an_104:7">104:7</span> At thy rebuke they fled; at the voice
of thy thunder they hasted away.

<span id="an_104:8">104:8</span> They go up by the mountains; they go
down by the valleys to the place which thou hast founded for them.

<span id="an_104:9">104:9</span> Thou hast set a bound that they may not
pass over; that they turn not again to cover the earth.

<span id="an_104:10">104:10</span> He sendeth the springs into the
valleys, which run among the hills.

<span id="an_104:11">104:11</span> They give drink to every beast of the
field: the wild asses quench their thirst.

<span id="an_104:12">104:12</span> By them shall the fowls of the heaven
have their habitation, which sing among the branches.

<span id="an_104:13">104:13</span> He watereth the hills from his
chambers: the earth is satisfied with the fruit of thy works.

<span id="an_104:14">104:14</span> He causeth the grass to grow for the
cattle, and herb for the service of man: that he may bring forth food
out of the earth;

<span id="an_104:15">104:15</span> And wine that maketh glad the heart
of man, and oil to make his face to shine, and bread which strengtheneth
man's heart.

<span id="an_104:16">104:16</span> The trees of the LORD are full of
sap; the cedars of Lebanon, which he hath planted;

<span id="an_104:17">104:17</span> Where the birds make their nests: as
for the stork, the fir-trees are her house.

<span id="an_104:18">104:18</span> The high hills are a refuge for the
wild goats; and the rocks for the conies.

<span id="an_104:19">104:19</span> He appointeth the moon for seasons:
the sun knoweth his going down.

<span id="an_104:20">104:20</span> Thou makest darkness, and it is
night: in which all the beasts of the forest do creep forth.

<span id="an_104:21">104:21</span> The young lions roar after their
prey, and seek their food from God.

<span id="an_104:22">104:22</span> The sun ariseth, they collect, and
lay themselves down in their dens.

<span id="an_104:23">104:23</span> Man goeth forth to his work and to
his labor until the evening.

<span id="an_104:24">104:24</span> O LORD, how manifold are thy works!
in wisdom hast thou made them all: the earth is full of thy riches.

<span id="an_104:25">104:25</span> So is this great and wide sea, in
which are creeping animals innumerable, both small and great beasts.

<span id="an_104:26">104:26</span> There go the ships: there is that
leviathan, which thou hast made to play therein.

<span id="an_104:27">104:27</span> These wait all upon thee; that thou
mayest give them their food in due season.

<span id="an_104:28">104:28</span> That which thou givest them, they
gather: thou openest thy hand, they are filled with good.

<span id="an_104:29">104:29</span> Thou hidest thy face, they are
troubled: thou takest away their breath, they die, and return to their
dust.

<span id="an_104:30">104:30</span> Thou sendest forth thy spirit, they
are created: and thou renewest the face of the earth.

<span id="an_104:31">104:31</span> The glory of the LORD shall endure
for ever: the LORD shall rejoice in his works.

<span id="an_104:32">104:32</span> He looketh on the earth, and it
trembleth: he toucheth the hills, and they smoke.

<span id="an_104:33">104:33</span> I will sing to the LORD as long as I
live: I will sing praise to my God while I have my being.

<span id="an_104:34">104:34</span> My meditation of him shall be sweet:
I will be glad in the LORD.

<span id="an_104:35">104:35</span> Let sinners be consumed out of the
earth, and let the wicked be no more. Bless thou the LORD, O my soul.
Praise ye the LORD.

<span id="an_105:1">105:1</span> O give thanks to the LORD; call upon
his name: make known his deeds among the people.

<span id="an_105:2">105:2</span> Sing to him, sing psalms to him: talk
ye of all his wondrous works.

<span id="an_105:3">105:3</span> Glory ye in his holy name: let the
heart of them rejoice that seek the LORD.

<span id="an_105:4">105:4</span> Seek the LORD, and his strength: seek
his face evermore.

<span id="an_105:5">105:5</span> Remember his wonderful works that he
hath done; his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth;

<span id="an_105:6">105:6</span> O ye seed of Abraham his servant, ye
children of Jacob his chosen.

<span id="an_105:7">105:7</span> He is the LORD our God: his judgments
are in all the earth.

<span id="an_105:8">105:8</span> He hath remembered his covenant for
ever, the word which he commanded to a thousand generations.

<span id="an_105:9">105:9</span> Which covenant he made with Abraham,
and his oath to Isaac;

<span id="an_105:10">105:10</span> And confirmed the same to Jacob for a
law, and to Israel for an everlasting covenant:

<span id="an_105:11">105:11</span> Saying, To thee will I give the land
of Canaan, the lot of your inheritance:

<span id="an_105:12">105:12</span> When they were a few men in number;
yes, very few, and strangers in it.

<span id="an_105:13">105:13</span> When they went from one nation to
another, from one kingdom to another people;

<span id="an_105:14">105:14</span> He suffered no man to do them wrong:
yes, he reproved kings for their sakes;

<span id="an_105:15">105:15</span> Saying, Touch not my anointed, and do
my prophets no harm.

<span id="an_105:16">105:16</span> Moreover he called for a famine upon
the land: he broke the whole staff of bread.

<span id="an_105:17">105:17</span> He sent a man before them, even
Joseph, who was sold for a servant:

<span id="an_105:18">105:18</span> Whose feet they hurt with fetters: he
was laid in iron:

<span id="an_105:19">105:19</span> Until the time that his word came:
the word of the LORD tried him.

<span id="an_105:20">105:20</span> The king sent and loosed him; even
the ruler of the people, and let him go free.

<span id="an_105:21">105:21</span> He made him lord of his house, and
ruler of all his substance:

<span id="an_105:22">105:22</span> To bind his princes at his pleasure;
and teach his senators wisdom.

<span id="an_105:23">105:23</span> Israel also came into Egypt; and
Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham.

<span id="an_105:24">105:24</span> And he increased his people greatly;
and made them stronger than their enemies.

<span id="an_105:25">105:25</span> He turned their heart to hate his
people, to deal subtilly with his servants.

<span id="an_105:26">105:26</span> He sent Moses his servant; and Aaron
whom he had chosen.

<span id="an_105:27">105:27</span> They showed his signs among them, and
wonders in the land of Ham.

<span id="an_105:28">105:28</span> He sent darkness, and made it dark;
and they rebelled not against his word.

<span id="an_105:29">105:29</span> He turned their waters into blood,
and slew their fish.

<span id="an_105:30">105:30</span> Their land brought forth frogs in
abundance, in the chambers of their kings.

<span id="an_105:31">105:31</span> He spoke, and there came divers sorts
of flies, and lice in all their borders.

<span id="an_105:32">105:32</span> He gave them hail for rain, and
flaming fire in their land.

<span id="an_105:33">105:33</span> He smote their vines also and their
fig-trees; and broke the trees of their borders.

<span id="an_105:34">105:34</span> He spoke, and the locusts came, and
caterpillars, and that without number,

<span id="an_105:35">105:35</span> And ate up all the herbs in their
land, and devoured the fruit of their ground.

<span id="an_105:36">105:36</span> He smote also all the first-born in
their land, the chief of all their strength.

<span id="an_105:37">105:37</span> He brought them forth also with
silver and gold: and there was not one feeble person among their tribes.

<span id="an_105:38">105:38</span> Egypt was glad when they departed:
for the fear of them fell upon them.

<span id="an_105:39">105:39</span> He spread a cloud for a covering; and
fire to give light in the night.

<span id="an_105:40">105:40</span> The people asked, and he brought
quails, and satisfied them with the bread of heaven.

<span id="an_105:41">105:41</span> He opened the rock, and the waters
gushed out; they ran in the dry places like a river.

<span id="an_105:42">105:42</span> For he remembered his holy promise,
and Abraham his servant.

<span id="an_105:43">105:43</span> And he brought forth his people with
joy, and his chosen with gladness:

<span id="an_105:44">105:44</span> And gave them the lands of the
heathen: and they inherited the labor of the people;

<span id="an_105:45">105:45</span> That they might observe his statutes,
and keep his laws. Praise ye the LORD.

<span id="an_106:1">106:1</span> Praise ye the LORD. O give thanks to
the LORD; for he is good: for his mercy endureth for ever.

<span id="an_106:2">106:2</span> Who can utter the mighty acts of the
LORD? who can show forth all his praise?

<span id="an_106:3">106:3</span> Blessed are they that keep judgment,
and he that doeth righteousness at all times.

<span id="an_106:4">106:4</span> Remember me, O LORD, with the favor
that thou bearest to thy people: O visit me with thy salvation;

<span id="an_106:5">106:5</span> That I may see the good of thy chosen,
that I may rejoice in the gladness of thy nation, that I may glory with
thy inheritance.

<span id="an_106:6">106:6</span> We have sinned with our fathers, we
have committed iniquity, we have done wickedly.

<span id="an_106:7">106:7</span> Our fathers understood not thy wonders
in Egypt; they remembered not the multitude of thy mercies; but provoked
him at the sea, even at the Red sea.

<span id="an_106:8">106:8</span> Nevertheless he saved them for his
name's sake, that he might make his mighty power to be known.

<span id="an_106:9">106:9</span> He rebuked the Red sea also, and it was
dried up: so he led them through the depths, as through the wilderness.

<span id="an_106:10">106:10</span> And he saved them from the hand of
him that hated them, and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.

<span id="an_106:11">106:11</span> And the waters covered their enemies:
there was not one of them left.

<span id="an_106:12">106:12</span> Then they believed his words; they
sang his praise.

<span id="an_106:13">106:13</span> They soon forgot his works; they
waited not for his counsel:

<span id="an_106:14">106:14</span> But lusted exceedingly in the
wilderness, and tempted God in the desert.

<span id="an_106:15">106:15</span> And he gave them their request; but
sent leanness into their soul.

<span id="an_106:16">106:16</span> They envied Moses also in the camp,
and Aaron the saint of the LORD.

<span id="an_106:17">106:17</span> The earth opened and swallowed up
Dathan, and covered the company of Abiram.

<span id="an_106:18">106:18</span> And a fire was kindled in their
company; the flame burned up the wicked.

<span id="an_106:19">106:19</span> They made a calf in Horeb, and
worshiped the molten image.

<span id="an_106:20">106:20</span> Thus they changed their glory into
the similitude of an ox that eateth grass.

<span id="an_106:21">106:21</span> They forgot God their savior, who had
done great things in Egypt;

<span id="an_106:22">106:22</span> Wondrous works in the land of Ham,
and terrible things by the Red sea.

<span id="an_106:23">106:23</span> Therefore he said that he would
destroy them, had not Moses his chosen stood before him in the breach,
to turn away his wrath, lest he should destroy them.

<span id="an_106:24">106:24</span> Yes, they despised the pleasant land,
they believed not his word:

<span id="an_106:25">106:25</span> But murmured in their tents, and
hearkened not to the voice of the LORD.

<span id="an_106:26">106:26</span> Therefore he lifted up his hand
against them, to overthrow them in the wilderness:

<span id="an_106:27">106:27</span> To overthrow their seed also among
the nations, and to scatter them in the lands.

<span id="an_106:28">106:28</span> They joined themselves also to
Baal-peor, and ate the sacrifices of the dead.

<span id="an_106:29">106:29</span> Thus they provoked him to anger with
their inventions: and the plague broke in upon them.

<span id="an_106:30">106:30</span> Then stood up Phinehas, and executed
judgment: and so the plague was stayed.

<span id="an_106:31">106:31</span> And that was counted to him for
righteousness to all generations for ever.

<span id="an_106:32">106:32</span> They angered him also at the waters
of strife, so that it went ill with Moses for their sakes:

<span id="an_106:33">106:33</span> Because they provoked his spirit, so
that he spoke unadvisedly with his lips.

<span id="an_106:34">106:34</span> They did not destroy the nations,
concerning whom the LORD commanded them:

<span id="an_106:35">106:35</span> But were mingled among the heathen,
and learned their works.

<span id="an_106:36">106:36</span> And they served their idols: which
were a snare to them.

<span id="an_106:37">106:37</span> Yes, they sacrificed their sons and
their daughters to demons,

<span id="an_106:38">106:38</span> And shed innocent blood, even the
blood of their sons and of their daughters, whom they sacrificed to the
idols of Canaan: and the land was polluted with blood.

<span id="an_106:39">106:39</span> Thus were they defiled with their own
works, and went astray with their own inventions.

<span id="an_106:40">106:40</span> Therefore was the wrath of the LORD
kindled against his people, insomuch that he abhorred his own
inheritance.

<span id="an_106:41">106:41</span> And he gave them into the hand of the
heathen; and they that hated them ruled over them.

<span id="an_106:42">106:42</span> Their enemies also oppressed them,
and they were brought into subjection under their hand.

<span id="an_106:43">106:43</span> Many times did he deliver them; but
they provoked him with their counsel; and were brought low for their
iniquity.

<span id="an_106:44">106:44</span> Nevertheless he regarded their
affliction, when he heard their cry:

<span id="an_106:45">106:45</span> And he remembered for them his
covenant, and repented according to the multitude of his mercies.

<span id="an_106:46">106:46</span> He made them also to be pitied by all
those that carried them captives.

<span id="an_106:47">106:47</span> Save us, O LORD our God, and gather
us from among the heathen, to give thanks to thy holy name, and to
triumph in thy praise.

<span id="an_106:48">106:48</span> Blessed be the LORD God of Israel
from everlasting to everlasting: and let all the people say, Amen.
Praise ye the LORD.

<span id="an_107:1">107:1</span> O give thanks to the LORD, for he is
good; for his mercy endureth for ever.

<span id="an_107:2">107:2</span> Let the redeemed of the LORD say so,
whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the enemy;

<span id="an_107:3">107:3</span> And gathered them out of the lands,
from the east, and from the west, from the north, and from the south.

<span id="an_107:4">107:4</span> They wandered in the wilderness in a
solitary way; they found no city to dwell in.

<span id="an_107:5">107:5</span> Hungry and thirsty, their soul fainted
in them.

<span id="an_107:6">107:6</span> Then they cried to the LORD in their
trouble, and he delivered them out of their distresses.

<span id="an_107:7">107:7</span> And he led them forth by the right way,
that they might go to a city of habitation.

<span id="an_107:8">107:8</span> Oh that men would praise the LORD for
his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men!

<span id="an_107:9">107:9</span> For he satisfieth the longing soul, and
filleth the hungry soul with goodness.

<span id="an_107:10">107:10</span> Such as sit in darkness and in the
shades of death, being bound in affliction and iron;

<span id="an_107:11">107:11</span> Because they rebelled against the
words of God, and contemned the counsel of the Most High:

<span id="an_107:12">107:12</span> Therefore he brought down their heart
with labor; they fell down, and there was none to help.

<span id="an_107:13">107:13</span> Then they cried to the LORD in their
trouble, and he saved them out of their distresses.

<span id="an_107:14">107:14</span> He brought them out of darkness and
the shades of death, and broke their bands asunder.

<span id="an_107:15">107:15</span> Oh that men would praise the LORD for
his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men!

<span id="an_107:16">107:16</span> For he hath broken the gates of
brass, and cut the bars of iron asunder.

<span id="an_107:17">107:17</span> Fools, because of their
transgression, and because of their iniquities, are afflicted.

<span id="an_107:18">107:18</span> Their soul abhorreth all manner of
food; and they draw near to the gates of death.

<span id="an_107:19">107:19</span> Then they cry to the LORD in their
trouble, he saveth them out of their distresses.

<span id="an_107:20">107:20</span> He sent his word, and healed them,
and delivered them from their destructions.

<span id="an_107:21">107:21</span> Oh that men would praise the LORD for
his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men!

<span id="an_107:22">107:22</span> And let them sacrifice the sacrifices
of thanksgiving, and declare his works with rejoicing.

<span id="an_107:23">107:23</span> They that go down to the sea in
ships, that do business on great waters;

<span id="an_107:24">107:24</span> These see the works of the LORD, and
his wonders in the deep.

<span id="an_107:25">107:25</span> For he commandeth, and raiseth the
stormy wind, which lifteth up its waves.

<span id="an_107:26">107:26</span> They mount up to the heaven, they go
down again to the depths: their soul is melted because of trouble.

<span id="an_107:27">107:27</span> They reel to and fro, and stagger
like a drunken man, and are at their wit's end.

<span id="an_107:28">107:28</span> Then they cry to the LORD in their
trouble, and he bringeth them out of their distresses.

<span id="an_107:29">107:29</span> He maketh the storm a calm, so that
the waves of the sea are still.

<span id="an_107:30">107:30</span> Then are they glad because they are
quiet; so he bringeth them to their desired haven.

<span id="an_107:31">107:31</span> Oh that men would praise the LORD for
his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men!

<span id="an_107:32">107:32</span> Let them exalt him also in the
congregation of the people, and praise him in the assembly of the
elders.

<span id="an_107:33">107:33</span> He turneth rivers into a wilderness,
and the water-springs into dry ground;

<span id="an_107:34">107:34</span> A fruitful land into barrenness, for
the wickedness of them that dwell in it.

<span id="an_107:35">107:35</span> He turneth the wilderness into a
standing water, and dry ground into water-springs.

<span id="an_107:36">107:36</span> And there he maketh the hungry to
dwell, that they may prepare a city for habitation;

<span id="an_107:37">107:37</span> And sow the fields, and plant
vineyards, which may yield fruits of increase.

<span id="an_107:38">107:38</span> He blesseth them also, so that they
are multiplied greatly; and suffereth not their cattle to decrease.

<span id="an_107:39">107:39</span> Again, they are diminished and
brought low through oppression, affliction, and sorrow.

<span id="an_107:40">107:40</span> He poureth contempt upon princes, and
causeth them to wander in the wilderness, where there is no way.

<span id="an_107:41">107:41</span> Yet he setteth the poor on high from
affliction, and maketh him families like a flock.

<span id="an_107:42">107:42</span> The righteous shall see it, and
rejoice: and all iniquity shall stop her mouth.

<span id="an_107:43">107:43</span> Whoever is wise, and will observe
these things, even they shall understand the loving-kindness of the
LORD.

<span id="an_108:1">108:1</span> A Song or Psalm of David. O God, my
heart is fixed; I will sing and give praise, even with my glory.

<span id="an_108:2">108:2</span> Awake, psaltery and harp: I myself will
awake early.

<span id="an_108:3">108:3</span> I will praise thee, O LORD, among the
people: and I will sing praises to thee among the nations.

<span id="an_108:4">108:4</span> For thy mercy is great above the
heavens: and thy truth reacheth to the clouds.

<span id="an_108:5">108:5</span> Be thou exalted, O God, above the
heavens: and thy glory above all the earth;

<span id="an_108:6">108:6</span> That thy beloved may be delivered: save
with thy right hand, and answer me.

<span id="an_108:7">108:7</span> God hath spoken in his holiness; I will
rejoice, I will divide Shechem, and measure out the valley of Succoth.

<span id="an_108:8">108:8</span> Gilead is mine; Manasseh is mine;
Ephraim also is the strength of my head; Judah is my lawgiver;

<span id="an_108:9">108:9</span> Moab is my washpot; over Edom will I
cast out my shoe; over Philistia will I triumph.

<span id="an_108:10">108:10</span> Who will bring me into the strong
city: who will lead me into Edom?

<span id="an_108:11">108:11</span> Wilt not thou, O God, who hast cast
us off? and wilt not thou, O God, go forth with our armies?

<span id="an_108:12">108:12</span> Give us help from trouble: for vain
is the help of man.

<span id="an_108:13">108:13</span> Through God we shall do valiantly:
for he will tread down our enemies.

<span id="an_109:1">109:1</span> To the chief Musician, A Psalm of
David. Hold not thy peace, O God of my praise;

<span id="an_109:2">109:2</span> For the mouth of the wicked and the
mouth of the deceitful are opened against me: they have spoken against
me with a lying tongue.

<span id="an_109:3">109:3</span> They encompassed me also with words of
hatred; and fought against me without a cause.

<span id="an_109:4">109:4</span> For my love they are my adversaries:
but I give myself to prayer.

<span id="an_109:5">109:5</span> And they have rewarded me evil for
good, and hatred for my love.

<span id="an_109:6">109:6</span> Set thou a wicked man over him: and let
Satan stand at his right hand.

<span id="an_109:7">109:7</span> When he shall be judged, let him be
condemned: and let his prayer become sin.

<span id="an_109:8">109:8</span> Let his days be few; and let another
take his office.

<span id="an_109:9">109:9</span> Let his children be fatherless, and his
wife a widow.

<span id="an_109:10">109:10</span> Let his children be continually
vagabonds, and beg: let them seek their bread also out of their desolate
places.

<span id="an_109:11">109:11</span> Let the extortioner catch all that he
hath; and let strangers spoil his labor.

<span id="an_109:12">109:12</span> Let there be none to extend mercy to
him: neither let there be any to favor his fatherless children.

<span id="an_109:13">109:13</span> Let his posterity be cut off; and in
the generation following let their name be blotted out.

<span id="an_109:14">109:14</span> Let the iniquity of his fathers be
remembered with the LORD; and let not the sin of his mother be blotted
out.

<span id="an_109:15">109:15</span> Let them be before the LORD
continually, that he may cut off the memory of them from the earth.

<span id="an_109:16">109:16</span> Because that he remembered not to
show mercy, but persecuted the poor and needy man, that he might even
slay the broken in heart.

<span id="an_109:17">109:17</span> As he loved cursing, so let it come
to him: as he delighted not in blessing, so let it be far from him.

<span id="an_109:18">109:18</span> As he clothed himself with cursing
like as with his garment, so let it come into his bowels like water, and
like oil into his bones.

<span id="an_109:19">109:19</span> Let it be to him as the garment which
covereth him, and for a girdle with which he is girded continually.

<span id="an_109:20">109:20</span> Let this be the reward of my
adversaries from the LORD, and of them that speak evil against my soul.

<span id="an_109:21">109:21</span> But do thou for me, O GOD the Lord,
for thy name's sake: because thy mercy is good, deliver thou me.

<span id="an_109:22">109:22</span> For I am poor and needy, and my heart
is wounded within me.

<span id="an_109:23">109:23</span> I am gone like the shadow when it
declineth: I am tossed up and down as the locust.

<span id="an_109:24">109:24</span> My knees are weak through fasting;
and my flesh faileth of fatness.

<span id="an_109:25">109:25</span> I became also a reproach to them:
when they looked upon me they shook their heads.

<span id="an_109:26">109:26</span> Help me, O LORD my God: O save me
according to thy mercy:

<span id="an_109:27">109:27</span> That they may know that this is thy
hand; that thou, LORD, hast done it.

<span id="an_109:28">109:28</span> Let them curse, but bless thou: when
they arise, let them be ashamed; but let thy servant rejoice.

<span id="an_109:29">109:29</span> Let my adversaries be clothed with
shame, and let them cover themselves with their own confusion, as with a
mantle.

<span id="an_109:30">109:30</span> I will greatly praise the LORD with
my mouth; yes, I will praise him among the multitude.

<span id="an_109:31">109:31</span> For he will stand at the right hand
of the poor, to save him from those that condemn his soul.

<span id="an_110:1">110:1</span> A Psalm of David. The LORD said to my
Lord, Sit thou at my right hand, until I make thy enemies thy footstool.

<span id="an_110:2">110:2</span> The LORD will send the rod of thy
strength out of Zion: rule thou in the midst of thy enemies.

<span id="an_110:3">110:3</span> Thy people shall be willing in the day
of thy power, in the beauties of holiness: from the womb of the morning,
thou hast the dew of thy youth.

<span id="an_110:4">110:4</span> The LORD hath sworn, and will not
repent, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedek.

<span id="an_110:5">110:5</span> The Lord at thy right hand will strike
through kings in the day of his wrath.

<span id="an_110:6">110:6</span> He will judge among the heathen, he
will fill the places with the dead bodies; he will wound the heads over
many countries.

<span id="an_110:7">110:7</span> He will drink of the brook in the way:
therefore will he lift up the head.

<span id="an_111:1">111:1</span> Praise ye the LORD. I will praise the
LORD with my whole heart, in the assembly of the upright, and in the
congregation.

<span id="an_111:2">111:2</span> The works of the LORD are great, sought
out by all them that have pleasure in them.

<span id="an_111:3">111:3</span> His work is honorable and glorious: and
his righteousness endureth for ever.

<span id="an_111:4">111:4</span> He hath made his wonderful works to be
remembered: the LORD is gracious and full of compassion.

<span id="an_111:5">111:5</span> He hath given food to them that fear
him: he will ever be mindful of his covenant.

<span id="an_111:6">111:6</span> He hath shown his people the power of
his works, that he may give them the heritage of the heathen.

<span id="an_111:7">111:7</span> The works of his hands are verity and
judgment; all his commandments are sure.

<span id="an_111:8">111:8</span> They stand fast for ever and ever, and
are done in truth and uprightness.

<span id="an_111:9">111:9</span> He sent redemption to his people: he
hath commanded his covenant for ever: holy and reverend is his name.

<span id="an_111:10">111:10</span> The fear of the LORD is the beginning
of wisdom: a good understanding have all they that do his commandments:
his praise endureth for ever.

<span id="an_112:1">112:1</span> Praise ye the LORD. Blessed is the man
that feareth the LORD, that delighteth greatly in his commandments.

<span id="an_112:2">112:2</span> His seed shall be mighty upon earth:
the generation of the upright shall be blessed.

<span id="an_112:3">112:3</span> Wealth and riches shall be in his
house: and his righteousness endureth for ever.

<span id="an_112:4">112:4</span> To the upright there ariseth light in
darkness: he is gracious, and full of compassion, and righteous.

<span id="an_112:5">112:5</span> A good man showeth favor, and lendeth:
he will guide his affairs with discretion.

<span id="an_112:6">112:6</span> Surely he shall not be moved for ever:
the righteous shall be in everlasting remembrance.

<span id="an_112:7">112:7</span> He shall not be afraid of evil tidings:
his heart is fixed, trusting in the LORD.

<span id="an_112:8">112:8</span> His heart is established, he shall not
be afraid, until he seeth his desire upon his enemies.

<span id="an_112:9">112:9</span> He hath dispersed, he hath given to the
poor; his righteousness endureth for ever; his horn shall be exalted
with honor.

<span id="an_112:10">112:10</span> The wicked shall see it, and be
grieved; he shall gnash with his teeth, and melt away: the desire of the
wicked shall perish.

<span id="an_113:1">113:1</span> Praise ye the LORD. Praise, O ye
servants of the LORD, praise the name of the LORD.

<span id="an_113:2">113:2</span> Blessed be the name of the LORD from
this time forth and for evermore.

<span id="an_113:3">113:3</span> From the rising of the sun to the going
down of the same the LORD'S name is to be praised.

<span id="an_113:4">113:4</span> The LORD is high above all nations, and
his glory above the heavens.

<span id="an_113:5">113:5</span> Who is like to the LORD our God, who
dwelleth on high.

<span id="an_113:6">113:6</span> Who humbleth himself to behold the
things that are in heaven, and in the earth!

<span id="an_113:7">113:7</span> He raiseth the poor out of the dust,
and lifteth the needy out of the dunghill;

<span id="an_113:8">113:8</span> That he may set him with princes, even
with the princes of his people.

<span id="an_113:9">113:9</span> He maketh the barren woman to keep
house, and to be a joyful mother of children. Praise ye the LORD.

<span id="an_114:1">114:1</span> When Israel went out of Egypt, the
house of Jacob from a people of a foreign language;

<span id="an_114:2">114:2</span> Judah was his sanctuary, and Israel his
dominion.

<span id="an_114:3">114:3</span> The sea saw it, and fled: Jordan was
driven back.

<span id="an_114:4">114:4</span> The mountains skipped like rams, and
the little hills like lambs.

<span id="an_114:5">114:5</span> What ailed thee, O thou sea, that thou
fleddest? thou Jordan, that thou wast driven back?

<span id="an_114:6">114:6</span> Ye mountains, that ye skipped like
rams; and ye little hills, like lambs?

<span id="an_114:7">114:7</span> Tremble, thou earth, at the presence of
the Lord, at the presence of the God of Jacob;

<span id="an_114:8">114:8</span> Who turned the rock into a standing
water, the flint into a fountain of waters.

<span id="an_115:1">115:1</span> Not to us, O LORD, not to us, but to
thy name give glory, for thy mercy, and for thy truth's sake.

<span id="an_115:2">115:2</span> Why should the heathen say, Where is
now their God?

<span id="an_115:3">115:3</span> But our God is in the heavens: he hath
done whatever he pleased.

<span id="an_115:4">115:4</span> Their idols are silver and gold; the
work of men's hands.

<span id="an_115:5">115:5</span> They have mouths, but they speak not:
eyes have they, but they see not:

<span id="an_115:6">115:6</span> They have ears, but they hear not:
noses have they, but they smell not:

<span id="an_115:7">115:7</span> They have hands, but they handle not:
feet have they, but they walk not: neither speak they through their
throat.

<span id="an_115:8">115:8</span> They that make them are like them; so
is every one that trusteth in them.

<span id="an_115:9">115:9</span> O Israel, trust thou in the LORD: he is
their help and their shield.

<span id="an_115:10">115:10</span> O house of Aaron, trust in the LORD:
he is their help and their shield.

<span id="an_115:11">115:11</span> Ye that fear the LORD, trust in the
LORD: he is their help and their shield.

<span id="an_115:12">115:12</span> The LORD hath been mindful of us: he
will bless us; he will bless the house of Israel; he will bless the
house of Aaron.

<span id="an_115:13">115:13</span> He will bless them that fear the
LORD, both small and great.

<span id="an_115:14">115:14</span> The LORD will increase you more and
more, you and your children.

<span id="an_115:15">115:15</span> Ye are blessed of the LORD who made
heaven and earth.

<span id="an_115:16">115:16</span> The heaven, even the heavens, are the
LORD'S: but the earth hath he given to the children of men.

<span id="an_115:17">115:17</span> The dead praise not the LORD, neither
any that go down into silence.

<span id="an_115:18">115:18</span> But we will bless the LORD from this
time forth and for ever. Praise the LORD.

<span id="an_116:1">116:1</span> I love the LORD, because he hath heard
my voice and my supplications.

<span id="an_116:2">116:2</span> Because he hath inclined his ear to me,
therefore will I call upon him as long as I live.

<span id="an_116:3">116:3</span> The sorrows of death encompassed me,
and the pains of hell came upon me: I found trouble and sorrow.

<span id="an_116:4">116:4</span> Then I called upon the name of the
LORD; O LORD, I beseech thee, deliver my soul.

<span id="an_116:5">116:5</span> Gracious is the LORD, and righteous;
yes, our God is merciful.

<span id="an_116:6">116:6</span> The LORD preserveth the simple: I was
brought low, and he helped me.

<span id="an_116:7">116:7</span> Return to thy rest, O my soul; for the
LORD hath dealt bountifully with thee.

<span id="an_116:8">116:8</span> For thou hast delivered my soul from
death, my eyes from tears, and my feet from falling.

<span id="an_116:9">116:9</span> I will walk before the LORD in the land
of the living.

<span id="an_116:10">116:10</span> I believed, therefore have I spoken:
I was greatly afflicted:

<span id="an_116:11">116:11</span> I said in my haste, All men are
liars.

<span id="an_116:12">116:12</span> What shall I render to the LORD for
all his benefits towards me?

<span id="an_116:13">116:13</span> I will take the cup of salvation, and
call upon the name of the LORD.

<span id="an_116:14">116:14</span> I will pay my vows to the LORD now in
the presence of all his people.

<span id="an_116:15">116:15</span> Precious in the sight of the LORD is
the death of his saints.

<span id="an_116:16">116:16</span> O LORD, truly I am thy servant; I am
thy servant, the son of thy handmaid: thou hast loosed my bonds.

<span id="an_116:17">116:17</span> I will offer to thee the sacrifice of
thanksgiving, and will call upon the name of the LORD.

<span id="an_116:18">116:18</span> I will pay my vows to the LORD now in
the presence of all his people,

<span id="an_116:19">116:19</span> In the courts of the LORD'S house, in
the midst of thee, O Jerusalem. Praise ye the LORD.

<span id="an_117:1">117:1</span> O praise the LORD, all ye nations:
praise him, all ye people.

<span id="an_117:2">117:2</span> For his merciful kindness is great
towards us: and the truth of the LORD endureth for ever. Praise ye the
LORD.

<span id="an_118:1">118:1</span> O give thanks to the LORD; for he is
good: because his mercy endureth for ever.

<span id="an_118:2">118:2</span> Let Israel now say, that his mercy
endureth for ever.

<span id="an_118:3">118:3</span> Let the house of Aaron now say, that
his mercy endureth for ever.

<span id="an_118:4">118:4</span> Let them now that fear the LORD say,
that his mercy endureth for ever.

<span id="an_118:5">118:5</span> I called upon the LORD in distress: the
LORD answered me, and set me in a large place.

<span id="an_118:6">118:6</span> The LORD is on my side; I will not
fear: what can man do to me?

<span id="an_118:7">118:7</span> The LORD taketh my part with them that
help me: therefore shall I see my desire upon them that hate me.

<span id="an_118:8">118:8</span> It is better to trust in the LORD than
to put confidence in man.

<span id="an_118:9">118:9</span> It is better to trust in the LORD than
to put confidence in princes.

<span id="an_118:10">118:10</span> All nations encompassed me: but in
the name of the LORD will I destroy them.

<span id="an_118:11">118:11</span> They encompassed me; yes, they
encompassed me: but in the name of the LORD I will destroy them.

<span id="an_118:12">118:12</span> They encompassed me like bees; they
are quenched as the fire of thorns: for in the name of the LORD I will
destroy them.

<span id="an_118:13">118:13</span> Thou hast violently thrust at me that
I might fall: but the LORD helped me.

<span id="an_118:14">118:14</span> The LORD is my strength and song, and
is become my salvation.

<span id="an_118:15">118:15</span> The voice of rejoicing and salvation
is in the tabernacles of the righteous: the right hand of the LORD doeth
valiantly.

<span id="an_118:16">118:16</span> The right hand of the LORD is
exalted: the right hand of the LORD doeth valiantly.

<span id="an_118:17">118:17</span> I shall not die, but live, and
declare the works of the LORD.

<span id="an_118:18">118:18</span> The LORD hath chastened me severely:
but he hath not given me over to death.

<span id="an_118:19">118:19</span> Open to me the gates of
righteousness: I will enter them, and I will praise the LORD:

<span id="an_118:20">118:20</span> This gate of the LORD, into which the
righteous shall enter.

<span id="an_118:21">118:21</span> I will praise thee: for thou hast
heard me, and art become my salvation.

<span id="an_118:22">118:22</span> The stone which the builders refused
is become the head stone of the corner.

<span id="an_118:23">118:23</span> This is the LORD'S doing; it is
wonderful in our eyes.

<span id="an_118:24">118:24</span> This is the day which the LORD hath
made; we will rejoice and be glad in it.

<span id="an_118:25">118:25</span> Save now, I beseech thee, O LORD: O
LORD, I beseech thee, send now prosperity.

<span id="an_118:26">118:26</span> Blessed be he that cometh in the name
of the LORD: we have blessed you out of the house of the LORD.

<span id="an_118:27">118:27</span> God is the LORD, who hath shown us
light: bind the sacrifice with cords, even to the horns of the altar.

<span id="an_118:28">118:28</span> Thou art my God, and I will praise
thee: thou art my God, I will exalt thee.

<span id="an_118:29">118:29</span> O give thanks to the LORD; for he is
good: for his mercy endureth for ever.

<span id="an_119:1">119:1</span> ALEPH. Blessed are the undefiled in the
way, who walk in the law of the LORD.

<span id="an_119:2">119:2</span> Blessed are they that keep his
testimonies, and that seek him with the whole heart.

<span id="an_119:3">119:3</span> They also do no iniquity: they walk in
his ways.

<span id="an_119:4">119:4</span> Thou hast commanded us to keep thy
precepts diligently.

<span id="an_119:5">119:5</span> O that my ways were directed to keep
thy statutes!

<span id="an_119:6">119:6</span> Then shall I not be ashamed, when I
have respect to all thy commandments.

<span id="an_119:7">119:7</span> I will praise thee with uprightness of
heart, when I shall have learned thy righteous judgments.

<span id="an_119:8">119:8</span> I will keep thy statutes: O forsake me
not utterly.

<span id="an_119:9">119:9</span> BETH. Wherewith shall a young man
cleanse his way? by taking heed to it, according to thy word.

<span id="an_119:10">119:10</span> With my whole heart have I sought
thee: O let me not wander from thy commandments.

<span id="an_119:11">119:11</span> Thy word have I hid in my heart, that
I might not sin against thee.

<span id="an_119:12">119:12</span> Blessed art thou, O LORD: teach me
thy statutes.

<span id="an_119:13">119:13</span> With my lips have I declared all the
judgments of thy mouth.

<span id="an_119:14">119:14</span> I have rejoiced in the way of thy
testimonies, as much as in all riches.

<span id="an_119:15">119:15</span> I will meditate in thy precepts, and
have respect to thy ways.

<span id="an_119:16">119:16</span> I will delight myself in thy
statutes: I will not forget thy word.

<span id="an_119:17">119:17</span> GIMEL. Deal bountifully with thy
servant, that I may live, and keep thy word.

<span id="an_119:18">119:18</span> Open thou my eyes, that I may behold
wondrous things out of thy law.

<span id="an_119:19">119:19</span> I am a stranger in the earth: hide
not thy commandments from me.

<span id="an_119:20">119:20</span> My soul breaketh for the longing that
it hath to thy judgments at all times.

<span id="an_119:21">119:21</span> Thou hast rebuked the proud that are
cursed, who do err from thy commandments.

<span id="an_119:22">119:22</span> Remove from me reproach and contempt;
for I have kept thy testimonies.

<span id="an_119:23">119:23</span> Princes also did sit and speak
against me: but thy servant did meditate in thy statutes.

<span id="an_119:24">119:24</span> Thy testimonies also are my delight,
and my counselors.

<span id="an_119:25">119:25</span> DALETH. My soul cleaveth to the dust:
revive thou me according to thy word.

<span id="an_119:26">119:26</span> I have declared my ways, and thou
heardest me: teach me thy statutes.

<span id="an_119:27">119:27</span> Make me to understand the way of thy
precepts: so shall I talk of thy wondrous works.

<span id="an_119:28">119:28</span> My soul melteth for heaviness:
strengthen thou me according to thy word.

<span id="an_119:29">119:29</span> Remove from me the way of lying: and
grant me thy law graciously.

<span id="an_119:30">119:30</span> I have chosen the way of truth: thy
judgments have I laid before me.

<span id="an_119:31">119:31</span> I have adhered to thy testimonies: O
LORD, put me not to shame.

<span id="an_119:32">119:32</span> I will run the way of thy
commandments, when thou shalt enlarge my heart.

<span id="an_119:33">119:33</span> HE. Teach me, O LORD, the way of thy
statutes; and I shall keep it to the end.

<span id="an_119:34">119:34</span> Give me understanding, and I shall
keep thy law; yes, I shall observe it with my whole heart.

<span id="an_119:35">119:35</span> Make me to go in the path of thy
commandments; for in that do I delight.

<span id="an_119:36">119:36</span> Incline my heart to thy testimonies,
and not to covetousness.

<span id="an_119:37">119:37</span> Turn away my eyes from beholding
vanity; and revive thou me in thy way.

<span id="an_119:38">119:38</span> Establish thy word to thy servant,
who is devoted to thy fear.

<span id="an_119:39">119:39</span> Turn away my reproach which I fear:
for thy judgments are good.

<span id="an_119:40">119:40</span> Behold, I have longed after thy
precepts: revive me in thy righteousness.

<span id="an_119:41">119:41</span> VAU. Let thy mercies come also to me,
O LORD, even thy salvation, according to thy word.

<span id="an_119:42">119:42</span> So shall I have with which to answer
him that reproacheth me: for I trust in thy word.

<span id="an_119:43">119:43</span> And take not the word of truth
utterly out of my mouth; for I have hoped in thy judgments.

<span id="an_119:44">119:44</span> So shall I keep thy law continually
for ever and ever.

<span id="an_119:45">119:45</span> And I will walk at liberty: for I
seek thy precepts.

<span id="an_119:46">119:46</span> I will speak of thy testimonies also
before kings, and will not be ashamed.

<span id="an_119:47">119:47</span> And I will delight myself in thy
commandments, which I have loved.

<span id="an_119:48">119:48</span> My hands also will I lift to thy
commandments, which I have loved; and I will meditate in thy statutes.

<span id="an_119:49">119:49</span> ZAIN. Remember the word to thy
servant, upon which thou hast caused me to hope.

<span id="an_119:50">119:50</span> This is my comfort in my affliction:
for thy word hath revived me.

<span id="an_119:51">119:51</span> The proud have had me greatly in
derision: yet I have not declined from thy law.

<span id="an_119:52">119:52</span> I remembered thy judgments of old, O
LORD; and have comforted myself.

<span id="an_119:53">119:53</span> Horror hath taken hold upon me
because of the wicked that forsake thy law.

<span id="an_119:54">119:54</span> Thy statutes have been my songs in
the house of my pilgrimage.

<span id="an_119:55">119:55</span> I have remembered thy name, O LORD,
in the night, and have kept thy law.

<span id="an_119:56">119:56</span> This I had, because I kept thy
precepts.

<span id="an_119:57">119:57</span> CHETH. Thou art my portion, O LORD: I
have said that I would keep thy words.

<span id="an_119:58">119:58</span> I entreated thy favor with my whole
heart: be merciful to me according to thy word.

<span id="an_119:59">119:59</span> I thought on my ways, and turned my
feet to thy testimonies.

<span id="an_119:60">119:60</span> I made haste, and delayed not to keep
thy commandments.

<span id="an_119:61">119:61</span> The bands of the wicked have robbed
me: but I have not forgotten thy law.

<span id="an_119:62">119:62</span> At midnight I will rise to give
thanks to thee, because of thy righteous judgments.

<span id="an_119:63">119:63</span> I am a companion of all them that
fear thee, and of them that keep thy precepts.

<span id="an_119:64">119:64</span> The earth, O LORD, is full of thy
mercy: teach me thy statutes.

<span id="an_119:65">119:65</span> TETH. Thou hast dealt well with thy
servant, O LORD, according to thy word.

<span id="an_119:66">119:66</span> Teach me good judgment and knowledge:
for I have believed thy commandments.

<span id="an_119:67">119:67</span> Before I was afflicted I went astray:
but now have I kept thy word.

<span id="an_119:68">119:68</span> Thou art good, and doest good; teach
me thy statutes.

<span id="an_119:69">119:69</span> The proud have forged a lie against
me: but I will keep thy precepts with my whole heart.

<span id="an_119:70">119:70</span> Their heart is as gross as fat; but I
delight in thy law.

<span id="an_119:71">119:71</span> It is good for me that I have been
afflicted; that I might learn thy statutes.

<span id="an_119:72">119:72</span> The law of thy mouth is better to me
than thousands of gold and silver.

<span id="an_119:73">119:73</span> JOD. Thy hands have made me and
fashioned me: give me understanding, that I may learn thy commandments.

<span id="an_119:74">119:74</span> They that fear thee will be glad when
they see me; because I have hoped in thy word.

<span id="an_119:75">119:75</span> I know, O LORD, that thy judgments
are right, and that thou in faithfulness hast afflicted me.

<span id="an_119:76">119:76</span> Let, I pray thee, thy merciful
kindness be for my comfort, according to thy word to thy servant.

<span id="an_119:77">119:77</span> Let thy tender mercies come to me,
that I may live: for thy law is my delight.

<span id="an_119:78">119:78</span> Let the proud be ashamed; for they
dealt perversely with me without a cause: but I will meditate in thy
precepts.

<span id="an_119:79">119:79</span> Let those that fear thee turn to me,
and those that have known thy testimonies.

<span id="an_119:80">119:80</span> Let my heart be sound in thy
statutes; that I may not be ashamed.

<span id="an_119:81">119:81</span> CAPH. My soul fainteth for thy
salvation: but I hope in thy word.

<span id="an_119:82">119:82</span> My eyes fail for thy word, saying,
When wilt thou comfort me?

<span id="an_119:83">119:83</span> For I am become like a bottle in the
smoke; yet I do not forget thy statutes.

<span id="an_119:84">119:84</span> How many are the days of thy servant?
when wilt thou execute judgment on them that persecute me?

<span id="an_119:85">119:85</span> The proud have digged pits for me,
which are not according to thy law.

<span id="an_119:86">119:86</span> All thy commandments are faithful:
they persecute me wrongfully; help thou me.

<span id="an_119:87">119:87</span> They had almost consumed me upon
earth; but I forsook not thy precepts.

<span id="an_119:88">119:88</span> Revive me after thy loving-kindness;
so shall I keep the testimony of thy mouth.

<span id="an_119:89">119:89</span> LAMED. For ever, O LORD, thy word is
settled in heaven.

<span id="an_119:90">119:90</span> Thy faithfulness is to all
generations: thou hast established the earth, and it abideth.

<span id="an_119:91">119:91</span> They continue this day according to
thy ordinances: for all are thy servants.

<span id="an_119:92">119:92</span> Unless thy law had been my delights,
I should then have perished in my affliction.

<span id="an_119:93">119:93</span> I will never forget thy precepts: for
with them thou hast revived me.

<span id="an_119:94">119:94</span> I am thine, save me; for I have
sought thy precepts.

<span id="an_119:95">119:95</span> The wicked have waited for me to
destroy me: but I will consider thy testimonies.

<span id="an_119:96">119:96</span> I have seen an end of all perfection:
but thy commandment is exceeding broad.

<span id="an_119:97">119:97</span> MEM. O how I love thy law! it is my
meditation all the day.

<span id="an_119:98">119:98</span> Thou through thy commandments hast
made me wiser than my enemies: for they are ever with me.

<span id="an_119:99">119:99</span> I have more understanding than all my
teachers: for thy testimonies are my meditation.

<span id="an_119:100">119:100</span> I understand more than the
ancients, because I keep thy precepts.

<span id="an_119:101">119:101</span> I have refrained my feet from every
evil way, that I might keep thy word.

<span id="an_119:102">119:102</span> I have not departed from thy
judgments: for thou hast taught me.

<span id="an_119:103">119:103</span> How sweet are thy words to my
taste! yes, sweeter than honey to my mouth!

<span id="an_119:104">119:104</span> Through thy precepts I get
understanding: therefore I hate every false way.

<span id="an_119:105">119:105</span> NUN. Thy word is a lamp to my feet,
and a light to my path.

<span id="an_119:106">119:106</span> I have sworn, and I will perform
it, that I will keep thy righteous judgments.

<span id="an_119:107">119:107</span> I am afflicted very much: revive
me, O LORD, according to thy word.

<span id="an_119:108">119:108</span> Accept, I beseech thee, the
free-will-offerings of my mouth, O LORD, and teach me thy judgments.

<span id="an_119:109">119:109</span> My soul is continually in my hand:
yet I do not forget thy law.

<span id="an_119:110">119:110</span> The wicked have laid a snare for
me: yet I erred not from thy precepts.

<span id="an_119:111">119:111</span> Thy testimonies have I taken as an
heritage for ever: for they are the rejoicing of my heart.

<span id="an_119:112">119:112</span> I have inclined my heart to perform
thy statutes always, even to the end.

<span id="an_119:113">119:113</span> SAMECH. I hate vain thoughts: but
thy law do I love.

<span id="an_119:114">119:114</span> Thou art my hiding place and my
shield: I hope in thy word.

<span id="an_119:115">119:115</span> Depart from me, ye evil-doers: for
I will keep the commandments of my God.

<span id="an_119:116">119:116</span> Uphold me according to thy word,
that I may live: and let me not be ashamed of my hope.

<span id="an_119:117">119:117</span> Support me, and I shall be safe:
and I will have respect to thy statutes continually.

<span id="an_119:118">119:118</span> Thou hast trodden down all them
that err from thy statutes: for their deceit is falsehood.

<span id="an_119:119">119:119</span> Thou puttest away all the wicked of
the earth like dross: therefore I love thy testimonies.

<span id="an_119:120">119:120</span> My flesh trembleth for fear of
thee; and I am afraid of thy judgments.

<span id="an_119:121">119:121</span> AIN. I have done judgment and
justice; leave me not to my oppressors.

<span id="an_119:122">119:122</span> Be surety for thy servant for good:
let not the proud oppress me.

<span id="an_119:123">119:123</span> My eyes fail for thy salvation, and
for the word of thy righteousness.

<span id="an_119:124">119:124</span> Deal with thy servant according to
thy mercy, and teach me thy statutes.

<span id="an_119:125">119:125</span> I am thy servant; give me
understanding, that I may know thy testimonies.

<span id="an_119:126">119:126</span> It is time for thee, LORD, to work:
for they have made void thy law.

<span id="an_119:127">119:127</span> Therefore I love thy commandments
above gold; yes, above fine gold.

<span id="an_119:128">119:128</span> Therefore I esteem all thy precepts
concerning all things to be right; and I hate every false way.

<span id="an_119:129">119:129</span> PE. Thy testimonies are wonderful:
therefore doth my soul keep them.

<span id="an_119:130">119:130</span> The entrance of thy words giveth
light; it giveth understanding to the simple.

<span id="an_119:131">119:131</span> I opened my mouth, and panted: for
I longed for thy commandments.

<span id="an_119:132">119:132</span> Look thou upon me, and be merciful
to me, as thou usest to do to those that love thy name.

<span id="an_119:133">119:133</span> Order my steps in thy word: and let
not any iniquity have dominion over me.

<span id="an_119:134">119:134</span> Deliver me from the oppression of
man: so will I keep thy precepts.

<span id="an_119:135">119:135</span> Make thy face to shine upon thy
servant: and teach me thy statutes.

<span id="an_119:136">119:136</span> Rivers of waters run down my eyes,
because they keep not thy law.

<span id="an_119:137">119:137</span> TSADDI. Righteous art thou, O LORD,
and upright are thy judgments.

<span id="an_119:138">119:138</span> Thy testimonies that thou hast
commanded are righteous and very faithful.

<span id="an_119:139">119:139</span> My zeal hath consumed me; because
my enemies have forgotten thy words.

<span id="an_119:140">119:140</span> Thy word is very pure: therefore
thy servant loveth it.

<span id="an_119:141">119:141</span> I am small and despised: yet I do
not forget thy precepts.

<span id="an_119:142">119:142</span> Thy righteousness is an everlasting
righteousness, and thy law is the truth.

<span id="an_119:143">119:143</span> Trouble and anguish have taken hold
on me: yet thy commandments are my delights.

<span id="an_119:144">119:144</span> The righteousness of thy
testimonies is everlasting: give me understanding, and I shall live.

<span id="an_119:145">119:145</span> KOPH. I cried with my whole heart;
hear me, O LORD: I will keep thy statutes.

<span id="an_119:146">119:146</span> I cried to thee; save me, and I
shall keep thy testimonies.

<span id="an_119:147">119:147</span> I came before the dawning of the
morning, and cried: I hoped in thy word.

<span id="an_119:148">119:148</span> My eyes anticipated the night
watches, that I might meditate in thy word.

<span id="an_119:149">119:149</span> Hear my voice, according to thy
loving-kindness: O LORD, revive me according to thy judgment.

<span id="an_119:150">119:150</span> They draw nigh that follow after
mischief: they are far from thy law.

<span id="an_119:151">119:151</span> Thou art near, O LORD; and all thy
commandments are truth.

<span id="an_119:152">119:152</span> Concerning thy testimonies, I have
known of old that thou hast founded them for ever.

<span id="an_119:153">119:153</span> RESH. Consider my affliction, and
deliver me: for I do not forget thy law.

<span id="an_119:154">119:154</span> Plead my cause, and deliver me:
revive me according to thy word.

<span id="an_119:155">119:155</span> Salvation is far from the wicked:
for they seek not thy statutes.

<span id="an_119:156">119:156</span> Great are thy tender mercies, O
LORD: revive me according to thy judgments.

<span id="an_119:157">119:157</span> Many are my persecutors and my
enemies; yet I do not decline from thy testimonies.

<span id="an_119:158">119:158</span> I beheld the transgressors, and was
grieved; because they kept not thy word.

<span id="an_119:159">119:159</span> Consider how I love thy precepts:
revive me, O LORD, according to thy loving-kindness.

<span id="an_119:160">119:160</span> Thy word is true from the
beginning: and every one of thy righteous judgments endureth for ever.

<span id="an_119:161">119:161</span> SCHIN. Princes have persecuted me
without a cause; but my heart standeth in awe of thy word.

<span id="an_119:162">119:162</span> I rejoice at thy word, as one that
findeth great spoil.

<span id="an_119:163">119:163</span> I hate and abhor lying: but thy law
do I love.

<span id="an_119:164">119:164</span> Seven times a day do I praise thee,
because of thy righteous judgments.

<span id="an_119:165">119:165</span> Great peace have they who love thy
law: and nothing shall cause them to stumble.

<span id="an_119:166">119:166</span> LORD, I have hoped for thy
salvation, and performed thy commandments.

<span id="an_119:167">119:167</span> My soul hath kept thy testimonies;
and I love them exceedingly.

<span id="an_119:168">119:168</span> I have kept thy precepts and thy
testimonies: for all my ways are before thee.

<span id="an_119:169">119:169</span> TAU. Let my cry come near before
thee, O LORD: give me understanding according to thy word.

<span id="an_119:170">119:170</span> Let my supplication come before
thee: deliver me according to thy word.

<span id="an_119:171">119:171</span> My lips shall utter praise, when
thou hast taught me thy statutes.

<span id="an_119:172">119:172</span> My tongue shall speak of thy word:
for all thy commandments are righteousness.

<span id="an_119:173">119:173</span> Let thy hand help me; for I have
chosen thy precepts.

<span id="an_119:174">119:174</span> I have longed for thy salvation, O
LORD; and thy law is my delight.

<span id="an_119:175">119:175</span> Let my soul live, and it shall
praise thee; and let thy judgments help me.

<span id="an_119:176">119:176</span> I have gone astray like a lost
sheep; seek thy servant; for I do not forget thy commandments.

<span id="an_120:1">120:1</span> A Song of degrees. In my distress I
cried to the LORD, and he heard me.

<span id="an_120:2">120:2</span> Deliver my soul, O LORD, from lying
lips, and from a deceitful tongue.

<span id="an_120:3">120:3</span> What shall be given to thee? or what
shall be done to thee, thou false tongue?

<span id="an_120:4">120:4</span> Sharp arrows of the mighty, with coals
of juniper.

<span id="an_120:5">120:5</span> Woe is me, that I sojourn in Mesech,
that I dwell in the tents of Kedar!

<span id="an_120:6">120:6</span> My soul hath long dwelt with him that
hateth peace.

<span id="an_120:7">120:7</span> I am for peace: but when I speak, they
are for war.

<span id="an_121:1">121:1</span> A Song of degrees. I will lift up my
eyes to the hills, from whence cometh my help.

<span id="an_121:2">121:2</span> My help cometh from the LORD, who made
heaven and earth.

<span id="an_121:3">121:3</span> He will not suffer thy foot to be
moved: he that keepeth thee will not slumber.

<span id="an_121:4">121:4</span> Behold, he that keepeth Israel shall
neither slumber nor sleep.

<span id="an_121:5">121:5</span> The LORD is thy keeper: the LORD is thy
shade upon thy right hand.

<span id="an_121:6">121:6</span> The sun shall not smite thee by day,
nor the moon by night.

<span id="an_121:7">121:7</span> The LORD will preserve thee from all
evil: he will preserve thy soul.

<span id="an_121:8">121:8</span> The LORD will preserve thy going out
and thy coming in from this time forth, and even for ever.

<span id="an_122:1">122:1</span> A Song of degrees of David. I was glad
when they said to me, Let us go into the house of the LORD.

<span id="an_122:2">122:2</span> Our feet shall stand within thy gates,
O Jerusalem.

<span id="an_122:3">122:3</span> Jerusalem is built as a city that is
compact together:

<span id="an_122:4">122:4</span> Whither the tribes go up, the tribes of
the LORD, to the testimony of Israel, to give thanks to the name of the
LORD.

<span id="an_122:5">122:5</span> For there are set thrones of judgment,
the thrones of the house of David.

<span id="an_122:6">122:6</span> Pray for the peace of Jerusalem: they
shall prosper that love thee.

<span id="an_122:7">122:7</span> Peace be within thy walls, and
prosperity within thy palaces.

<span id="an_122:8">122:8</span> For my brethren and companions' sake, I
will now say, Peace be within thee.

<span id="an_122:9">122:9</span> Because of the house of the LORD our
God I will seek thy good.

<span id="an_123:1">123:1</span> A Song of degrees. To thee I raise my
eyes, O thou that dwellest in the heavens.

<span id="an_123:2">123:2</span> Behold, as the eyes of servants look to
the hand of their masters, and as the eyes of a maiden to the hand of
her mistress; so our eyes wait upon the LORD our God, until he shall
have mercy upon us.

<span id="an_123:3">123:3</span> Have mercy upon us, O LORD, have mercy
upon us; for we are exceedingly filled with contempt.

<span id="an_123:4">123:4</span> Our soul is exceedingly filled with the
scorning of those that are at ease, and with the contempt of the proud.

<span id="an_124:1">124:1</span> A Song of degrees of David. If it had
not been the LORD who was on our side, now may Israel say;

<span id="an_124:2">124:2</span> If it had not been the LORD who was on
our side, when men rose up against us:

<span id="an_124:3">124:3</span> Then they had swallowed us up quick,
when their wrath was kindled against us:

<span id="an_124:4">124:4</span> Then the waters had overwhelmed us, the
stream had gone over our soul:

<span id="an_124:5">124:5</span> Then the proud waters had gone over our
soul.

<span id="an_124:6">124:6</span> Blessed be the LORD, who hath not given
us as a prey to their teeth.

<span id="an_124:7">124:7</span> Our soul hath escaped as a bird out of
the snare of the fowlers: the snare is broken, and we have escaped.

<span id="an_124:8">124:8</span> Our help is in the name of the LORD,
who made heaven and earth.

<span id="an_125:1">125:1</span> A Song of degrees. They that trust in
the LORD, shall be as mount Zion, which cannot be removed, but abideth
for ever.

<span id="an_125:2">125:2</span> As the mountains are round Jerusalem,
so the LORD is around his people from henceforth even for ever.

<span id="an_125:3">125:3</span> For the rod of the wicked shall not
rest upon the lot of the righteous; lest the righteous put forth their
hands to iniquity.

<span id="an_125:4">125:4</span> Do good, O LORD, to those that are
good, and to them that are upright in their hearts.

<span id="an_125:5">125:5</span> As for such as turn aside to their
crooked ways, the LORD shall lead them forth with the workers of
iniquity: but peace shall be upon Israel.

<span id="an_126:1">126:1</span> A Song of degrees. When the LORD turned
again the captivity of Zion, we were like them that dream.

<span id="an_126:2">126:2</span> Then was our mouth filled with
laughter, and our tongue with singing: then said they among the heathen,
The LORD hath done great things for them.

<span id="an_126:3">126:3</span> The LORD hath done great things for us;
of which we are glad.

<span id="an_126:4">126:4</span> Turn again our captivity, O LORD, as
the streams in the south.

<span id="an_126:5">126:5</span> They that sow in tears shall reap in
joy.

<span id="an_126:6">126:6</span> He that goeth forth and weepeth,
bearing precious seed, shall doubtless return with rejoicing, bringing
his sheaves with him.

<span id="an_127:1">127:1</span> A Song of degrees for Solomon. Except
the LORD shall build the house, they labor in vain that build it: except
the LORD shall keep the city, the watchman waketh in vain.

<span id="an_127:2">127:2</span> It is vain for you to rise early, to
sit up late, to eat the bread of sorrows: for so he giveth his beloved
sleep.

<span id="an_127:3">127:3</span> Lo, children are a heritage of the
LORD: and the fruit of the womb is his reward.

<span id="an_127:4">127:4</span> As arrows are in the hand of a mighty
man: so are children of the youth.

<span id="an_127:5">127:5</span> Happy is the man that hath his quiver
full of them: they shall not be ashamed, but they shall speak with the
enemies in the gate.

<span id="an_128:1">128:1</span> A Song of degrees. Blessed is every one
that feareth the LORD; that walketh in his ways.

<span id="an_128:2">128:2</span> For thou shalt eat the labor of thy
hands: happy shalt thou be, and it shall be well with thee.

<span id="an_128:3">128:3</span> Thy wife shall be as a fruitful vine by
the sides of thy house: thy children like olive plants around thy table.

<span id="an_128:4">128:4</span> Behold, that thus shall the man be
blessed that feareth the LORD.

<span id="an_128:5">128:5</span> The LORD shall bless thee out of Zion:
and thou shalt see the good of Jerusalem all the days of thy life.

<span id="an_128:6">128:6</span> Yes, thou shalt see thy children's
children, and peace upon Israel.

<span id="an_129:1">129:1</span> A Song of degrees. Many a time have
they afflicted me from my youth, may Israel now say:

<span id="an_129:2">129:2</span> Many a time have they afflicted me from
my youth: yet they have not prevailed against me.

<span id="an_129:3">129:3</span> The plowers plowed upon my back: they
made long their furrows.

<span id="an_129:4">129:4</span> The LORD is righteous: he hath cut
asunder the cords of the wicked.

<span id="an_129:5">129:5</span> Let them all be confounded and turned
back that hate Zion.

<span id="an_129:6">129:6</span> Let them be as the grass upon the
house-tops, which withereth before it groweth up:

<span id="an_129:7">129:7</span> With which the mower filleth not his
hand; nor he that bindeth sheaves, his bosom.

<span id="an_129:8">129:8</span> Neither do they who go by, say, The
blessing of the LORD be upon you: we bless you in the name of the LORD.

<span id="an_130:1">130:1</span> A Song of degrees. Out of the depths
have I cried to thee, O LORD.

<span id="an_130:2">130:2</span> Lord, hear my voice: let thy ears be
attentive to the voice of my supplications.

<span id="an_130:3">130:3</span> If thou, LORD, shouldest mark
iniquities, O Lord, who shall stand?

<span id="an_130:4">130:4</span> But there is forgiveness with thee,
that thou mayest be feared.

<span id="an_130:5">130:5</span> I wait for the LORD, my soul doth wait,
and in his word do I hope.

<span id="an_130:6">130:6</span> My soul waiteth for the Lord more than
they that watch for the morning: I say, more than they that watch for
the morning.

<span id="an_130:7">130:7</span> Let Israel hope in the LORD: for with
the LORD there is mercy, and with him is plenteous redemption.

<span id="an_130:8">130:8</span> And he shall redeem Israel from all his
iniquities.

<span id="an_131:1">131:1</span> A Song of degrees of David. LORD, my
heart is not haughty, nor my eyes lofty: neither do I exercise myself in
great matters, or in things too high for me.

<span id="an_131:2">131:2</span> Surely I have behaved and quieted
myself as a child that is weaned by his mother: my soul is even as a
weaned child.

<span id="an_131:3">131:3</span> Let Israel hope in the LORD from
henceforth and for ever.

<span id="an_132:1">132:1</span> A Song of degrees. LORD, remember David
and all his afflictions;

<span id="an_132:2">132:2</span> How he swore to the LORD, and vowed to
the mighty God of Jacob;

<span id="an_132:3">132:3</span> Surely I will not come into the
tabernacle of my house, nor go up into my bed;

<span id="an_132:4">132:4</span> I will not give sleep to my eyes, or
slumber to my eyelids,

<span id="an_132:5">132:5</span> Until I find a place for the LORD, a
habitation for the mighty God of Jacob.

<span id="an_132:6">132:6</span> Lo, we heard of it at Ephratah: we
found it in the fields of the wood.

<span id="an_132:7">132:7</span> We will go into his tabernacles: we
will worship at his footstool.

<span id="an_132:8">132:8</span> Arise, O LORD, into thy rest; thou, and
the ark of thy strength.

<span id="an_132:9">132:9</span> Let thy priests be clothed with
righteousness; and let thy saints shout for joy.

<span id="an_132:10">132:10</span> For thy servant David's sake turn not
away the face of thy anointed.

<span id="an_132:11">132:11</span> The LORD hath sworn in truth to
David; he will not turn from it; Of the fruit of thy body will I set
upon thy throne.

<span id="an_132:12">132:12</span> If thy children will keep my covenant
and my testimony that I shall teach them; their children also shall sit
upon thy throne for ever.

<span id="an_132:13">132:13</span> For the LORD hath chosen Zion; he
hath desired it for his habitation.

<span id="an_132:14">132:14</span> This is my rest for ever: here will I
dwell; for I have desired it.

<span id="an_132:15">132:15</span> I will abundantly bless her
provision: I will satisfy her poor with bread.

<span id="an_132:16">132:16</span> I will also clothe her priests with
salvation, and her saints shall shout aloud for joy.

<span id="an_132:17">132:17</span> There will I make the horn of David
to bud, I have ordained a lamp for my anointed.

<span id="an_132:18">132:18</span> His enemies will I clothe with shame:
but upon himself shall his crown flourish.

<span id="an_133:1">133:1</span> A Song of degrees of David. Behold, how
good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity!

<span id="an_133:2">133:2</span> It is like the precious ointment upon
the head, that ran down upon the beard, even Aaron's beard: that went
down to the skirts of his garment;

<span id="an_133:3">133:3</span> As the dew of Hermon, and as the dew
that descended upon the mountains of Zion: for there the LORD commanded
the blessing, even life for ever.

<span id="an_134:1">134:1</span> A Song of degrees. Behold, bless ye the
LORD, all ye servants of the LORD, who by night stand in the house of
the LORD.

<span id="an_134:2">134:2</span> Lift up your hands in the sanctuary,
and bless the LORD.

<span id="an_134:3">134:3</span> The LORD that made heaven and earth
bless thee out of Zion.

<span id="an_135:1">135:1</span> Praise ye the LORD. Praise ye the name
of the LORD; praise him, O ye servants of the LORD.

<span id="an_135:2">135:2</span> Ye that stand in the house of the LORD,
in the courts of the house of our God,

<span id="an_135:3">135:3</span> Praise the LORD; for the LORD is good;
sing praises to his name; for it is pleasant.

<span id="an_135:4">135:4</span> For the LORD hath chosen Jacob to
himself, and Israel for his peculiar treasure.

<span id="an_135:5">135:5</span> For I know that the LORD is great, and
that our Lord is above all gods.

<span id="an_135:6">135:6</span> Whatever the LORD pleased, that did he
in heaven, and in earth, in the seas, and all deep places.

<span id="an_135:7">135:7</span> He causeth the vapors to ascend from
the ends of the earth; he maketh lightnings for the rain; he bringeth
the wind out of his treasuries.

<span id="an_135:8">135:8</span> Who smote the first-born of Egypt, both
of man and beast.

<span id="an_135:9">135:9</span> Who sent tokens and wonders into the
midst of thee, O Egypt, upon Pharaoh, and upon all his servants.

<span id="an_135:10">135:10</span> Who smote great nations, and slew
mighty kings;

<span id="an_135:11">135:11</span> Sihon king of the Amorites, and Og
king of Bashan, and all the kingdoms of Canaan:

<span id="an_135:12">135:12</span> And gave their land for a heritage, a
heritage to Israel his people.

<span id="an_135:13">135:13</span> Thy name, O LORD, endureth for ever;
and thy memorial, O LORD, throughout all generations.

<span id="an_135:14">135:14</span> For the LORD will judge his people,
and he will repent concerning his servants.

<span id="an_135:15">135:15</span> The idols of the heathen are silver
and gold, the work of men's hands.

<span id="an_135:16">135:16</span> They have mouths, but they speak not;
eyes have they, but they see not.

<span id="an_135:17">135:17</span> They have ears, but they hear not;
neither is there any breath in their mouths.

<span id="an_135:18">135:18</span> They that make them are like them: so
is every one that trusteth in them.

<span id="an_135:19">135:19</span> Bless the LORD, O house of Israel:
bless the LORD, O house of Aaron:

<span id="an_135:20">135:20</span> Bless the LORD, O house of Levi: ye
that fear the LORD, bless the LORD.

<span id="an_135:21">135:21</span> Blessed be the LORD out of Zion, who
dwelleth at Jerusalem. Praise ye the LORD.

<span id="an_136:1">136:1</span> O give thanks to the LORD; for he is
good: for his mercy endureth for ever.

<span id="an_136:2">136:2</span> O give thanks to the God of gods: for
his mercy endureth for ever.

<span id="an_136:3">136:3</span> O give thanks to the Lord of lords: for
his mercy endureth for ever.

<span id="an_136:4">136:4</span> To him who alone doeth great wonders:
for his mercy endureth for ever.

<span id="an_136:5">136:5</span> To him that by wisdom made the heavens:
for his mercy endureth for ever.

<span id="an_136:6">136:6</span> To him that stretched out the earth
above the waters: for his mercy endureth for ever.

<span id="an_136:7">136:7</span> To him that made great lights: for his
mercy endureth for ever:

<span id="an_136:8">136:8</span> The sun to rule by day: for his mercy
endureth for ever:

<span id="an_136:9">136:9</span> The moon and stars to rule by night:
for his mercy endureth for ever.

<span id="an_136:10">136:10</span> To him that smote Egypt in their
first-born: for his mercy endureth for ever:

<span id="an_136:11">136:11</span> And brought out Israel from among
them: for his mercy endureth for ever:

<span id="an_136:12">136:12</span> With a strong hand, and with an
out-stretched arm: for his mercy endureth for ever.

<span id="an_136:13">136:13</span> To him who divided the Red sea into
parts: for his mercy endureth for ever.

<span id="an_136:14">136:14</span> And made Israel to pass through the
midst of it: for his mercy endureth for ever:

<span id="an_136:15">136:15</span> But overthrew Pharaoh and his army in
the Red sea: for his mercy endureth for ever.

<span id="an_136:16">136:16</span> To him who led his people through the
wilderness: for his mercy endureth for ever.

<span id="an_136:17">136:17</span> To him who smote great kings: for his
mercy endureth for ever:

<span id="an_136:18">136:18</span> And slew famous kings: for his mercy
endureth for ever.

<span id="an_136:19">136:19</span> Sihon king of the Amorites: for his
mercy endureth for ever:

<span id="an_136:20">136:20</span> And Og king of Bashan: for his mercy
endureth for ever:

<span id="an_136:21">136:21</span> And gave their land for a heritage:
for his mercy endureth for ever:

<span id="an_136:22">136:22</span> Even a heritage to Israel his
servant: for his mercy endureth for ever.

<span id="an_136:23">136:23</span> Who remembered us in our low estate:
for his mercy endureth for ever:

<span id="an_136:24">136:24</span> And hath redeemed us from our
enemies: for his mercy endureth for ever.

<span id="an_136:25">136:25</span> Who giveth food to all flesh: for his
mercy endureth for ever.

<span id="an_136:26">136:26</span> O give thanks to the God of heaven:
for his mercy endureth for ever.

<span id="an_137:1">137:1</span> By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat
down, yes, we wept, when we remembered Zion.

<span id="an_137:2">137:2</span> We hung our harps upon the willows in
the midst of it.

<span id="an_137:3">137:3</span> For there they that carried us away
captive required of us a song; and they that wasted us required of us
mirth, saying, Sing us one of the songs of Zion.

<span id="an_137:4">137:4</span> How shall we sing the LORD'S song in a
foreign land?

<span id="an_137:5">137:5</span> If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, let my
right hand forget her skill.

<span id="an_137:6">137:6</span> If I do not remember thee, let my
tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth; if I prefer not Jerusalem above
my chief joy.

<span id="an_137:7">137:7</span> Remember, O LORD, the children of Edom
in the day of Jerusalem; who said, Raze it, raze it, even to its
foundation.

<span id="an_137:8">137:8</span> O daughter of Babylon, who art to be
destroyed; happy shall he be, that rewardeth thee as thou hast served
us.

<span id="an_137:9">137:9</span> Happy shall he be, that taketh and
dasheth thy little ones against the stones.

<span id="an_138:1">138:1</span> A Psalm of David. I will praise thee
with my whole heart: before the gods will I sing praise to thee.

<span id="an_138:2">138:2</span> I will worship towards thy holy temple,
and praise thy name for thy loving-kindness and for thy truth: for thou
hast magnified thy word above all thy name.

<span id="an_138:3">138:3</span> In the day when I cried thou didst
answer me, and strengthen me with strength in my soul.

<span id="an_138:4">138:4</span> All the kings of the earth shall praise
thee, O LORD, when they hear the words of thy mouth.

<span id="an_138:5">138:5</span> Yes, they shall sing in the ways of the
LORD: for great is the glory of the LORD.

<span id="an_138:6">138:6</span> Though the LORD is high, yet hath he
respect to the lowly: but the proud he knoweth afar off.

<span id="an_138:7">138:7</span> Though I walk in the midst of trouble,
thou wilt revive me: thou wilt stretch forth thy hand against the wrath
of my enemies, and thy right hand will save me.

<span id="an_138:8">138:8</span> The LORD will perfect that which
concerneth me: thy mercy, O LORD, endureth for ever: forsake not the
works thy own hands.

<span id="an_139:1">139:1</span> To the chief Musician, A Psalm of
David. O LORD, thou hast searched me, and known me.

<span id="an_139:2">139:2</span> Thou knowest my down-sitting and my up
rising, thou understandest my thought afar off.

<span id="an_139:3">139:3</span> Thou compassest my path and my lying
down, and art acquainted with all my ways.

<span id="an_139:4">139:4</span> For there is not a word on my tongue,
but lo, O LORD, thou knowest it altogether.

<span id="an_139:5">139:5</span> Thou hast beset me behind and before,
and laid thy hand upon me.

<span id="an_139:6">139:6</span> Such knowledge is too wonderful for me;
it is high, I cannot attain to it.

<span id="an_139:7">139:7</span> Whither shall I go from thy spirit? or
whither shall I flee from thy presence?

<span id="an_139:8">139:8</span> If I ascend into heaven, thou art
there: if I make my bed in hell, behold, thou art there.

<span id="an_139:9">139:9</span> If I take the wings of the morning, and
dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea;

<span id="an_139:10">139:10</span> Even there shall thy hand lead me,
and thy right hand shall hold me.

<span id="an_139:11">139:11</span> If I say, Surely the darkness shall
cover me; even the night shall be light about me.

<span id="an_139:12">139:12</span> Yes, the darkness hideth not from
thee; but the night shineth as the day: the darkness and the light are
both alike to thee.

<span id="an_139:13">139:13</span> For thou hast possessed my reins:
thou hast covered me in my mother's womb.

<span id="an_139:14">139:14</span> I will praise thee: for I am
fearfully and wonderfully made: wonderful are thy works; and that my
soul well knoweth.

<span id="an_139:15">139:15</span> My substance was not hid from thee
when I was made in secret, and curiously formed in the lowest parts of
the earth.

<span id="an_139:16">139:16</span> Thy eyes saw my substance, yet being
imperfect; and in thy book all my members were written, which in
continuance were fashioned, when as yet there was none of them.

<span id="an_139:17">139:17</span> How precious also are thy thoughts to
me, O God! how great is the sum of them!

<span id="an_139:18">139:18</span> If I should count them, they are more
in number than the sand: when I awake, I am still with thee.

<span id="an_139:19">139:19</span> Surely thou wilt slay the wicked, O
God: depart from me therefore, ye bloody men.

<span id="an_139:20">139:20</span> For they speak against thee wickedly,
and thy enemies take thy name in vain.

<span id="an_139:21">139:21</span> Do not I hate them, O LORD, that hate
thee? and am not I grieved with those that rise up against thee?

<span id="an_139:22">139:22</span> I hate them with perfect hatred: I
count them my enemies.

<span id="an_139:23">139:23</span> Search me, O God, and know my heart;
try me, and know my thoughts:

<span id="an_139:24">139:24</span> And see if there is any wicked way in
me, and lead me in the way everlasting.

<span id="an_140:1">140:1</span> To the chief Musician, A Psalm of
David. Deliver me, O LORD, from the evil man: preserve me from the
violent man;

<span id="an_140:2">140:2</span> Who imagine mischiefs in their heart;
continually are they assembled for war.

<span id="an_140:3">140:3</span> They have sharpened their tongues like
a serpent; adder's poison is under their lips. Selah.

<span id="an_140:4">140:4</span> Keep me, O LORD, from the hands of the
wicked; preserve me from the violent man; who have purposed to overthrow
my goings.

<span id="an_140:5">140:5</span> The proud have hid a snare for me, and
cords; they have spread a net by the way side: they have set gins for
me. Selah.

<span id="an_140:6">140:6</span> I said to the LORD, Thou art my God:
hear the voice of my supplications, O LORD.

<span id="an_140:7">140:7</span> O GOD the Lord, the strength of my
salvation, thou hast covered my head in the day of battle.

<span id="an_140:8">140:8</span> Grant not, O LORD, the desires of the
wicked: further not his wicked device; lest they exalt themselves.
Selah.

<span id="an_140:9">140:9</span> As for the head of those that encompass
me, let the mischief of their own lips cover them.

<span id="an_140:10">140:10</span> Let burning coals fall upon them: let
them be cast into the fire; into deep pits, that they rise not again.

<span id="an_140:11">140:11</span> Let not an evil speaker be
established on the earth: evil shall hunt the violent man to overthrow
him.

<span id="an_140:12">140:12</span> I know that the LORD will maintain
the cause of the afflicted, and the right of the poor.

<span id="an_140:13">140:13</span> Surely the righteous shall give
thanks to thy name: the upright shall dwell in thy presence.

<span id="an_141:1">141:1</span> A Psalm of David. LORD, I cry to thee:
make haste to me; give ear to my voice, when I cry to thee.

<span id="an_141:2">141:2</span> Let my prayer be set forth before thee
as incense; and the lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrifice.

<span id="an_141:3">141:3</span> Set a watch, O LORD, before my mouth;
keep the door of my lips.

<span id="an_141:4">141:4</span> Incline not my heart to any evil thing,
to practice wicked works with men that work iniquity: and let me not eat
of their dainties.

<span id="an_141:5">141:5</span> Let the righteous smite me; it shall be
a kindness: and let him reprove me; it shall be an excellent oil, which
shall not break my head: for yet my prayer also shall be in their
calamities.

<span id="an_141:6">141:6</span> When their judges are overthrown in
stony places, they shall hear my words; for they are sweet.

<span id="an_141:7">141:7</span> Our bones are scattered at the grave's
mouth, as when one cutteth and cleaveth wood upon the earth.

<span id="an_141:8">141:8</span> But my eyes are to thee, O GOD the
Lord: in thee is my trust; leave not my soul destitute.

<span id="an_141:9">141:9</span> Keep me from the snare which they have
laid for me, and the gins of the workers of iniquity.

<span id="an_141:10">141:10</span> Let the wicked fall into their own
nets, whilst I escape.

<span id="an_142:1">142:1</span> Maschil of David; a prayer when he was
in the cave. I cried to the LORD with my voice; with my voice to the
LORD I made my supplication.

<span id="an_142:2">142:2</span> I poured out my complaint before him; I
showed before him my trouble.

<span id="an_142:3">142:3</span> When my spirit was overwhelmed within
me, then thou knewest my path. In the way in which I walked have they
privily laid a snare for me.

<span id="an_142:4">142:4</span> I looked on my right hand, and beheld,
but there was no man that would know me: refuge failed me; no man cared
for my soul.

<span id="an_142:5">142:5</span> I cried to thee, O LORD: I said, Thou
art my refuge and my portion in the land of the living.

<span id="an_142:6">142:6</span> Attend to my cry; for I am brought very
low: deliver me from my persecutors; for they are stronger than I.

<span id="an_142:7">142:7</span> Bring my soul out of prison, that I may
praise thy name: the righteous shall encompass me; for thou wilt deal
bountifully with me.

<span id="an_143:1">143:1</span> A Psalm of David. Hear my prayer, O
LORD, give ear to my supplications: in thy faithfulness answer me, and
in thy righteousness.

<span id="an_143:2">143:2</span> And enter not into judgment with thy
servant: for in thy sight shall no man living be justified.

<span id="an_143:3">143:3</span> For the enemy hath persecuted my soul;
he hath smitten my life down to the ground; he hath made me to dwell in
darkness, as those that have been long dead.

<span id="an_143:4">143:4</span> Therefore is my spirit overwhelmed
within me; my heart within me is desolate.

<span id="an_143:5">143:5</span> I remember the days of old, I meditate
on all thy works; I muse on the work of thy hands.

<span id="an_143:6">143:6</span> I stretch forth my hands to thee: my
soul thirsteth after thee, as a thirsty land. Selah.

<span id="an_143:7">143:7</span> Hear me speedily, O LORD: my spirit
faileth: hide not thy face from me, lest I be like them that go down
into the pit.

<span id="an_143:8">143:8</span> Cause me to hear thy loving-kindness in
the morning; for in thee do I trust: cause me to know the way in which I
should walk; for I lift up my soul to thee.

<span id="an_143:9">143:9</span> Deliver me, O LORD, from my enemies: I
flee to thee to hide me.

<span id="an_143:10">143:10</span> Teach me to do thy will; for thou art
my God: thy spirit is good; lead me into the land of uprightness.

<span id="an_143:11">143:11</span> Revive me, O LORD, for thy name's
sake: for thy righteousness' sake bring my soul out of trouble.

<span id="an_143:12">143:12</span> And of thy mercy cut off my enemies,
and destroy all them that afflict my soul: for I am thy servant.

<span id="an_144:1">144:1</span> A Psalm of David. Blessed be the LORD
my strength, who teacheth my hands to war, and my fingers to fight;

<span id="an_144:2">144:2</span> My goodness, and my fortress; my high
tower, and my deliverer; my shield, and he in whom I trust; who subdueth
my people under me.

<span id="an_144:3">144:3</span> LORD, what is man, that thou takest
knowledge of him! or the son of man, that thou makest account of him!

<span id="an_144:4">144:4</span> Man is like to vanity: his days are as
a shadow that passeth away.

<span id="an_144:5">144:5</span> Bow thy heavens, O LORD, and come down:
touch the mountains, and they shall smoke.

<span id="an_144:6">144:6</span> Cast forth lightning, and scatter them:
shoot thy arrows, and destroy them.

<span id="an_144:7">144:7</span> Send thy hand from above; rid me, and
deliver me out of great waters, from the hand of strange children;

<span id="an_144:8">144:8</span> Whose mouth speaketh vanity, and their
right hand is a right hand of falsehood.

<span id="an_144:9">144:9</span> I will sing a new song to thee, O God:
upon a psaltery and an instrument of ten strings will I sing praises to
thee.

<span id="an_144:10">144:10</span> It is he that giveth salvation to
kings: who delivereth David his servant from the hurtful sword.

<span id="an_144:11">144:11</span> Rid me, and deliver me from the hand
of strange children, whose mouth speaketh vanity, and their right hand
is a right hand of falsehood:

<span id="an_144:12">144:12</span> That our sons may be as plants grown
up in their youth; that our daughters may be as corner stones, polished
after the similitude of a palace:

<span id="an_144:13">144:13</span> That our granaries may be full,
affording all manner of store; that our sheep may bring forth thousands
and ten thousands in our streets:

<span id="an_144:14">144:14</span> That our oxen may be strong to labor;
that there be no breaking in, nor going out; that there be no
complaining in our streets.

<span id="an_144:15">144:15</span> Happy is that people, that is in such
a case: yes, happy is that people, whose God is the LORD.

<span id="an_145:1">145:1</span> David's Psalm of praise. I will extol
thee, my God, O king; and I will bless thy name for ever and ever.

<span id="an_145:2">145:2</span> Every day will I bless thee; and I will
praise thy name for ever and ever.

<span id="an_145:3">145:3</span> Great is the LORD, and greatly to be
praised; and his greatness is unsearchable.

<span id="an_145:4">145:4</span> One generation shall praise thy works
to another, and shall declare thy mighty acts.

<span id="an_145:5">145:5</span> I will speak of the glorious honor of
thy majesty, and of thy wondrous works.

<span id="an_145:6">145:6</span> And men shall speak of the might of thy
terrible acts: and I will declare thy greatness.

<span id="an_145:7">145:7</span> They shall abundantly utter the memory
of thy great goodness, and shall sing of thy righteousness.

<span id="an_145:8">145:8</span> The LORD is gracious, and full of
compassion; slow to anger, and of great mercy.

<span id="an_145:9">145:9</span> The LORD is good to all: and his tender
mercies are over all his works.

<span id="an_145:10">145:10</span> All thy works shall praise thee, O
LORD; and thy saints shall bless thee.

<span id="an_145:11">145:11</span> They shall speak of the glory of thy
kingdom, and talk of thy power;

<span id="an_145:12">145:12</span> To make known to the sons of men his
mighty acts, and the glorious majesty of his kingdom.

<span id="an_145:13">145:13</span> Thy kingdom is an everlasting
kingdom, and thy dominion endureth throughout all generations.

<span id="an_145:14">145:14</span> The LORD upholdeth all that fall, and
raiseth up all those that are bowed down.

<span id="an_145:15">145:15</span> The eyes of all wait upon thee; and
thou givest them their food in due season.

<span id="an_145:16">145:16</span> Thou openest thy hand, and satisfiest
the desire of every living creature.

<span id="an_145:17">145:17</span> The LORD is righteous in all his
ways, and holy in all his works.

<span id="an_145:18">145:18</span> The LORD is nigh to all them that
call upon him, to all that call upon him in truth.

<span id="an_145:19">145:19</span> He will fulfill the desire of them
that fear him: he also will hear their cry, and will save them.

<span id="an_145:20">145:20</span> The LORD preserveth all them that
love him: but all the wicked will he destroy.

<span id="an_145:21">145:21</span> My mouth shall speak the praise of
the LORD: and let all flesh bless his holy name for ever and ever.

<span id="an_146:1">146:1</span> Praise ye the LORD. Praise the LORD, O
my soul.

<span id="an_146:2">146:2</span> While I live will I praise the LORD: I
will sing praises to my God while I have any being.

<span id="an_146:3">146:3</span> Put not your trust in princes, nor in
the son of man, in whom there is no help.

<span id="an_146:4">146:4</span> His breath goeth forth, he returneth to
his earth; in that very day his thoughts perish.

<span id="an_146:5">146:5</span> Happy is he that hath the God of Jacob
for his help, whose hope is in the LORD his God:

<span id="an_146:6">146:6</span> Who made heaven, and earth, the sea,
and all that is in them: who keepeth truth for ever:

<span id="an_146:7">146:7</span> Who executeth judgment for the
oppressed: who giveth food to the hungry. The LORD looseth the
prisoners:

<span id="an_146:8">146:8</span> The LORD openeth the eyes of the blind:
the LORD raiseth them that are bowed down: the LORD loveth the
righteous:

<span id="an_146:9">146:9</span> The LORD preserveth the strangers; he
relieveth the fatherless and widow: but the way of the wicked he turneth
upside down.

<span id="an_146:10">146:10</span> The LORD will reign for ever, even
thy God, O Zion, to all generations. Praise ye the LORD.

<span id="an_147:1">147:1</span> Praise ye the LORD: for it is good to
sing praises to our God; for it is pleasant; and praise is comely.

<span id="an_147:2">147:2</span> The LORD buildeth up Jerusalem: he
gathereth together the outcasts of Israel.

<span id="an_147:3">147:3</span> He healeth the broken in heart, and
bindeth up their wounds.

<span id="an_147:4">147:4</span> He telleth the number of the stars; he
calleth them all by their names.

<span id="an_147:5">147:5</span> Great is our Lord, and of great power:
his understanding is infinite.

<span id="an_147:6">147:6</span> The LORD lifteth up the meek: he
casteth the wicked down to the ground.

<span id="an_147:7">147:7</span> Sing to the LORD with thanksgiving;
sing praise upon the harp to our God:

<span id="an_147:8">147:8</span> Who covereth the heaven with clouds,
who prepareth rain for the earth, who maketh grass to grow upon the
mountains.

<span id="an_147:9">147:9</span> He giveth to the beast his food, and to
the young ravens which cry.

<span id="an_147:10">147:10</span> He delighteth not in the strength of
the horse: he taketh not pleasure in the legs of a man.

<span id="an_147:11">147:11</span> The LORD taketh pleasure in them that
fear him, in those that hope in his mercy.

<span id="an_147:12">147:12</span> Praise the LORD, O Jerusalem; praise
thy God, O Zion.

<span id="an_147:13">147:13</span> For he hath strengthened the bars of
thy gates; he hath blessed thy children within thee.

<span id="an_147:14">147:14</span> He maketh peace in thy borders, and
filleth thee with the finest of the wheat.

<span id="an_147:15">147:15</span> He sendeth forth his commandment upon
earth: his word runneth very swiftly.

<span id="an_147:16">147:16</span> He giveth snow like wool: he
scattereth the hoar-frost like ashes.

<span id="an_147:17">147:17</span> He casteth forth his ice like
morsels: who can stand before his cold?

<span id="an_147:18">147:18</span> He sendeth out his word, and melteth
them: he causeth his wind to blow, and the waters flow.

<span id="an_147:19">147:19</span> He showeth his word to Jacob, his
statutes and his judgments to Israel.

<span id="an_147:20">147:20</span> He hath not dealt so with any nation:
and as for his judgments, they have not known them. Praise ye the LORD.

<span id="an_148:1">148:1</span> Praise ye the LORD. Praise ye the LORD
from the heavens: praise him in the hights.

<span id="an_148:2">148:2</span> Praise ye him, all his angels: praise
ye him, all his hosts.

<span id="an_148:3">148:3</span> Praise ye him, sun and moon: praise
him, all ye stars of light.

<span id="an_148:4">148:4</span> Praise him, ye heavens of heavens, and
ye waters that are above the heavens.

<span id="an_148:5">148:5</span> Let them praise the name of the LORD:
for he commanded, and they were created.

<span id="an_148:6">148:6</span> He hath also established them for ever
and ever: he hath made a decree which shall not pass.

<span id="an_148:7">148:7</span> Praise the LORD from the earth, ye
dragons, and all deeps:

<span id="an_148:8">148:8</span> Fire, and hail; snow, and vapors;
stormy wind fulfilling his word:

<span id="an_148:9">148:9</span> Mountains, and all hills; fruitful

<span id="an_148:10">148:10</span> Beasts, and all cattle; creeping

princes, and all judges of the earth:

<span id="an_148:12">148:12</span> Both young men, and maidens; old men,
and children:

<span id="an_148:13">148:13</span> Let them praise the name of the LORD:
for his name alone is excellent; his glory is above the earth and
heaven.

<span id="an_148:14">148:14</span> He also exalteth the horn of his

mouth, and a two-edged sword in their hand;

<span id="an_149:7">149:7</span> To execute vengeance upon the heathen,
and punishments upon the people;

<span id="an_149:8">149:8</span> To bind their kings with chains, and
their nobles with fetters of iron;

<span id="an_149:9">149:9</span> To execute upon them the judgment
written: this honor have all his saints. Praise ye the LORD.

<span id="an_150:1">150:1</span> Praise ye the LORD. Praise God in his
sanctuary: praise him in the firmament of his power.

<span id="an_150:2">150:2</span> Praise him for his mighty acts: praise
him according to his excellent greatness.

<span id="an_150:3">150:3</span> Praise him with the sound of the
trumpet: praise him with the psaltery and harp.

<span id="an_150:5">150:5</span> Praise him upon the loud cymbals:
praise him upon the high sounding cymbals.

<span id="an_150:6">150:6</span> Let every thing that hath breath praise
the LORD. Praise ye the LORD.
