### Webster's Bible: Colossians

<span id="an_1:1">1:1</span> Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the
will of God, and Timothy our brother,

<span id="an_1:2">1:2</span> To the saints and faithful brethren in
Christ who are at Colosse: Grace be to you, and peace, from God our
Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.

<span id="an_1:3">1:3</span> We give thanks to God and the Father of our
Lord Jesus Christ, praying always for you,

<span id="an_1:4">1:4</span> Since we heard of your faith in Christ
Jesus, and of the love which ye have to all the saints,

<span id="an_1:5">1:5</span> For the hope which is laid up for you in
heaven, of which ye have heard before in the word of the truth of the
gospel;

<span id="an_1:6">1:6</span> Which is come to you, as it is in all the
world; and bringeth forth fruit, as it doth also in you, since the day
ye heard of it, and knew the grace of God in truth:

<span id="an_1:7">1:7</span> As ye also learned from Epaphras our dear
fellow-servant, who is for you a faithful minister of Christ;

<span id="an_1:8">1:8</span> Who also declared to us your love in the
Spirit.

<span id="an_1:9">1:9</span> For this cause we also, since the day we
heard it, do not cease to pray for you, and to desire that ye may be
filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual
understanding;

<span id="an_1:10">1:10</span> That ye may walk worthy of the Lord to
all pleasing, being fruitful in every good work, and increasing in the
knowledge of God;

<span id="an_1:11">1:11</span> Strengthened with all might, according to
his glorious power, to all patience and long-suffering with joyfulness;

<span id="an_1:12">1:12</span> Giving thanks to the Father, who hath
made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light:

<span id="an_1:13">1:13</span> Who hath delivered us from the power of
darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom of his beloved Son:

<span id="an_1:14">1:14</span> In whom we have redemption through his
blood, even the forgiveness of sins:

<span id="an_1:15">1:15</span> Who is the image of the invisible God,
the first-born of every creature:

<span id="an_1:16">1:16</span> For by him were all things created, that
are in heaven, and that are upon earth, visible and invisible, whether
thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were
created by him, and for him:

<span id="an_1:17">1:17</span> And he is before all things, and by him
all things consist.

<span id="an_1:18">1:18</span> And he is the head of the body, the
church: who is the beginning, the first-born from the dead; that in all
things he may have the pre-eminence.

<span id="an_1:19">1:19</span> For it pleased the Father that in him
should all fullness dwell;

<span id="an_1:20">1:20</span> And, having made peace through the blood
of his cross, by him to reconcile all things to himself; by him, I say,
whether they are things on earth, or things in heaven.

<span id="an_1:21">1:21</span> And you, that were formerly alienated and
enemies in your mind by wicked works, yet now hath he reconciled,

<span id="an_1:22">1:22</span> In the body of his flesh through death,
to present you holy and unblamable and unreprovable in his sight:

<span id="an_1:23">1:23</span> If ye continue in the faith grounded and
settled, and are not moved away from the hope of the gospel, which ye
have heard, and which hath been preached to every creature which is
under heaven; of which I Paul am made a minister;

<span id="an_1:24">1:24</span> Who now rejoice in my sufferings for you,
and fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my
flesh for his body's sake, which is the church:

<span id="an_1:25">1:25</span> Of which I am made a minister, according
to the dispensation of God which is given to me for you, to fulfill the
word of God;

<span id="an_1:26">1:26</span> Even the mystery which hath been hid from
ages, and from generations, but now is made manifest to his saints:

<span id="an_1:27">1:27</span> To whom God would make known what is the
riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles; which is Christ
in you, the hope of glory:

<span id="an_1:28">1:28</span> Whom we preach, warning every man, and
teaching every man in all wisdom; that we may present every man perfect
in Christ Jesus.

<span id="an_1:29">1:29</span> For which I also labor, striving
according to his working, which worketh in me mightily.

<span id="an_2:1">2:1</span> For I would that ye knew what great
conflict I have for you, and for them at Laodicea, and for as many as
have not seen my face in the flesh;

<span id="an_2:2">2:2</span> That their hearts may be comforted, being
knit together in love, and to all riches of the full assurance of
understanding to the acknowledgment of the mystery of God, and of the
Father, and of Christ;

<span id="an_2:3">2:3</span> In whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom
and knowledge.

<span id="an_2:4">2:4</span> And this I say, lest any man should deceive
you with enticing words.

<span id="an_2:5">2:5</span> For though I am absent in the flesh, yet I
am with you in the spirit, joying and beholding your order, and the
steadfastness of your faith in Christ.

<span id="an_2:6">2:6</span> As ye have therefore received Christ Jesus
the Lord, so walk ye in him:

<span id="an_2:7">2:7</span> Rooted and built up in him, and established
in the faith, as ye have been taught, abounding in it with thanksgiving.

<span id="an_2:8">2:8</span> Beware lest any man make a prey of you
through philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after
the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ.

<span id="an_2:9">2:9</span> For in him dwelleth all the fullness of the
Godhead bodily.

<span id="an_2:10">2:10</span> And ye are complete in him, who is the
head of all principality and power:

<span id="an_2:11">2:11</span> In whom also ye are circumcised with the
circumcision made without hands, in putting off the body of the sins of
the flesh by the circumcision of Christ:

<span id="an_2:12">2:12</span> Buried with him in baptism, in which also
ye are raised with him through the faith of the operation of God, who
hath raised him from the dead.

<span id="an_2:13">2:13</span> And you, being dead in your sins and the
uncircumcision of your flesh, hath he made alive together with him,
having forgiven you all trespasses;

<span id="an_2:14">2:14</span> Blotting out the hand-writing of
ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took it
out of the way, nailing it to his cross;

<span id="an_2:15">2:15</span> And having despoiled principalities and
powers, he made a show of them openly, triumphing over them in it.

<span id="an_2:16">2:16</span> Let no man therefore judge you in food,
or in drink, or in respect of a holy-day, or or the new-moon, or of the
sabbaths:

<span id="an_2:17">2:17</span> Which are a shadow of things to come; but
the body is of Christ.

<span id="an_2:18">2:18</span> Let no man beguile you of your reward in
a voluntary humility and worshiping of angels, intruding into those
things which he hath not seen, vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind,

<span id="an_2:19">2:19</span> And not holding the head, from which all
the body by joints and bands having nourishment ministered, and knit
together, increaseth with the increase of God.

<span id="an_2:20">2:20</span> Wherefore, if ye are dead with Christ
from the rudiments of the world, why, as though living in the world, are
ye subject to ordinances,

<span id="an_2:21">2:21</span> (Touch not; taste not; handle not;

<span id="an_2:22">2:22</span> Which all are to perish with the using;)
according to the commandments and doctrines of men?

<span id="an_2:23">2:23</span> Which things have indeed a show of wisdom
in will-worship, and humility, and neglecting of the body; not in any
honor to the satisfying of the flesh.

<span id="an_3:1">3:1</span> If ye then be raised with Christ, seek
those things which are above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of
God.

<span id="an_3:2">3:2</span> Set your affection on things above, not on
things on the earth.

<span id="an_3:3">3:3</span> For ye are dead, and your life is hid with
Christ in God.

<span id="an_3:4">3:4</span> When Christ, who is our life, shall appear,
then will ye also appear with him in glory.

<span id="an_3:5">3:5</span> Mortify therefore your members which are
upon the earth; lewdness, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil
concupiscence, and covetousness, which is idolatry:

<span id="an_3:6">3:6</span> For which things the wrath of God cometh on
the children of disobedience:

<span id="an_3:7">3:7</span> In which ye also walked formerly, when ye
lived with them.

<span id="an_3:8">3:8</span> But now ye also put off all these; anger,
wrath, malice, blasphemy, filthy communication out of your mouth.

<span id="an_3:9">3:9</span> Lie not one to another, seeing ye have put
off the old man with his deeds;

<span id="an_3:10">3:10</span> And have put on the new man, which is
renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him:

<span id="an_3:11">3:11</span> Where there is neither Greek nor Jew,
circumcision nor uncircumcision, Barbarian, Scythian, bond nor free: but
Christ is all, and in all.

<span id="an_3:12">3:12</span> Put on therefore, as the elect of God,
holy and beloved, bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind,
meekness, long-suffering;

<span id="an_3:13">3:13</span> Forbearing one another, and forgiving one
another, if any man hath a quarrel against any: even as Christ forgave
you, so also do ye.

<span id="an_3:14">3:14</span> And above all these things put on
charity, which is the bond of perfectness.

<span id="an_3:15">3:15</span> And let the peace of God rule in your
hearts, to which also ye are called in one body; and be ye thankful.

<span id="an_3:16">3:16</span> Let the word of Christ dwell in you
richly in all wisdom; teaching and admonishing one another in psalms,
and hymns, and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the
Lord.

<span id="an_3:17">3:17</span> And whatever ye do in word or deed, do
all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and the Father
by him.

<span id="an_3:18">3:18</span> Wives, submit yourselves to your own
husbands, as it is fit in the Lord.

<span id="an_3:19">3:19</span> Husbands, love your wives, and be not
bitter against them.

<span id="an_3:20">3:20</span> Children, obey your parents in all
things: for this is well-pleasing to the Lord.

<span id="an_3:21">3:21</span> Fathers, provoke not your children to
anger, lest they be discouraged.

<span id="an_3:22">3:22</span> Servants, obey in all things your masters
according to the flesh; not with eye-service, as men-pleasers; but in
singleness of heart, fearing God:

<span id="an_3:23">3:23</span> And whatever ye do, do it heartily, as to
the Lord, and not to men;

<span id="an_3:24">3:24</span> Knowing that from the Lord ye will
receive the reward of the inheritance: for ye serve the Lord Christ.

<span id="an_3:25">3:25</span> But he that doeth wrong, will receive for
the wrong which he hath done: and there is no respect of persons.

<span id="an_4:1">4:1</span> Masters, give to your servants that which
is just and equal; knowing that ye also have a Master in heaven.

<span id="an_4:2">4:2</span> Continue in prayer, and watch in the same
with thanksgiving;

<span id="an_4:3">4:3</span> At the same time praying also for us, that
God would open to us a door of utterance, to speak the mystery of
Christ, for which I am also in bonds:

<span id="an_4:4">4:4</span> That I may make it manifest, as I ought to
speak.

<span id="an_4:5">4:5</span> Walk in wisdom towards them that are
without, redeeming the time.

<span id="an_4:6">4:6</span> Let your speech be always with grace,
seasoned with salt, that ye may know how ye ought to answer every man.

<span id="an_4:7">4:7</span> All my state shall Tychicus declare to you,
who is a beloved brother, and a faithful minister and fellow-servant in
the Lord:

<span id="an_4:8">4:8</span> Whom I have sent to you for the same
purpose, that he may know your state, and comfort your hearts;

<span id="an_4:9">4:9</span> With Onesimus, a faithful and beloved
brother, who is one of you. They will make known to you all things which
are done here.

<span id="an_4:10">4:10</span> Aristarchus, my fellow-prisoner, saluteth
you; and Marcus, sister's son to Barnabas, (concerning whom ye received
commandments: if he should come to you, receive him;)

<span id="an_4:11">4:11</span> And Jesus, who is called Justus, who are
of the circumcision. These only are my fellow-workers to the kingdom of
God, who have been a comfort to me.

<span id="an_4:12">4:12</span> Epaphras, who is one of you, a servant of
Christ, saluteth you, always laboring fervently for you in prayers, that
ye may stand perfect and complete in all the will of God.

<span id="an_4:13">4:13</span> For I bear him testimony, that he hath a
great zeal for you, and them that are in Laodicea, and them in
Hierapolis.

<span id="an_4:14">4:14</span> Luke, the beloved physician, and Demas,
greet you.

<span id="an_4:15">4:15</span> Salute the brethren who are in Laodicea,
and Nymphas, and the church which is in his house.

<span id="an_4:16">4:16</span> And when this epistle is read among you,
cause that it be read also in the church of the Laodiceans; and that ye
likewise read the epistle from Laodicea.

<span id="an_4:17">4:17</span> And say to Archippus, take heed to the
ministry which thou hast received in the Lord, that thou fulfill it.

<span id="an_4:18">4:18</span> The salutation by the hand of me Paul.
Remember my bonds. Grace be with you. Amen.
