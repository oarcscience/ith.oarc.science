### Webster's Bible: Haggai

<span id="an_1:1">1:1</span> In the second year of Darius the king, in
the sixth month, in the first day of the month, came the word of the
LORD by Haggai the prophet to Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor
of Judah, and to Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest, saying,

<span id="an_1:2">1:2</span> Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, saying,
This people say, The time is not come, the time that the LORD'S house
should be built.

<span id="an_1:3">1:3</span> Then came the word of the LORD by Haggai
the prophet, saying,

<span id="an_1:4">1:4</span> Is it time for you, O ye, to dwell in your
ceiled houses, and this house lie waste?

<span id="an_1:5">1:5</span> Now therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts;
Consider your ways.

<span id="an_1:6">1:6</span> Ye have sown much, and bring in little; ye
eat, but ye have not enough; ye drink, but ye are not filled with drink;
ye clothe yourselves, but there is none warm; and he that earneth wages
earneth wages to put it into a bag with holes.

<span id="an_1:7">1:7</span> Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Consider your
ways.

<span id="an_1:8">1:8</span> Go up to the mountain, and bring wood, and
build the house; and I will take pleasure in it, and I will be
glorified, saith the LORD.

<span id="an_1:9">1:9</span> Ye looked for much, and lo, it came to
little; and when ye brought it home, I did blow upon it. Why? saith the
LORD of hosts. Because of my house that is waste, and ye run every man
to his own house.

<span id="an_1:10">1:10</span> Therefore the heaven over you is stayed
from dew, and the earth is stayed from her fruit.

<span id="an_1:11">1:11</span> And I called for a drouth upon the land,
and upon the mountains, and upon the corn, and upon the new wine, and
upon the oil, and upon that which the ground bringeth forth, and upon
men, and upon cattle, and upon all the labor of the hands.

<span id="an_1:12">1:12</span> Then Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and
Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest, with all the remnant of the
people, obeyed the voice of the LORD their God, and the words of Haggai
the prophet, as the LORD their God had sent him, and the people did fear
before the LORD.

<span id="an_1:13">1:13</span> Then spoke Haggai the LORD'S messenger in
the LORD'S message to the people, saying, I am with you, saith the LORD.

<span id="an_1:14">1:14</span> And the LORD stirred up the spirit of
Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and the spirit of
Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest, and the spirit of all the
remnant of the people; and they came and performed work in the house of
the LORD of hosts, their God,

<span id="an_1:15">1:15</span> In the four and twentieth day of the same
month, in the second year of Darius the king.

<span id="an_2:1">2:1</span> In the seventh month, in the one and
twentieth day of the month, came the word of the LORD by the prophet
Haggai, saying,

<span id="an_2:2">2:2</span> Speak now to Zerubbabel the son of
Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua the son of Josedech the high
priest, and to the residue of the people, saying,

<span id="an_2:3">2:3</span> Who is left among you that saw this house
in her first glory? and how do ye see it now? is it not in your eyes in
comparison of it as nothing?

<span id="an_2:4">2:4</span> Yet now be strong, O Zerubbabel, saith the
LORD; and be strong, O Joshua, son of Josedech, the high priest; and be
strong, all ye people of the land, saith the LORD, and work: for I am
with you, saith the LORD of hosts:

<span id="an_2:5">2:5</span> According to the word that I covenanted
with you when ye came out of Egypt, so my spirit remaineth among you:
fear ye not.

<span id="an_2:6">2:6</span> For thus saith the LORD of hosts; Yet once,
it is a little while, and I will shake the heavens, and the earth, and
the sea, and the dry land;

<span id="an_2:7">2:7</span> And I will shake all nations, and the
desire of all nations shall come: and I will fill this house with glory,
saith the LORD of hosts.

<span id="an_2:8">2:8</span> The silver is mine, and the gold is mine,
saith the LORD of hosts.

<span id="an_2:9">2:9</span> The glory of this latter house shall be
greater than of the former, saith the LORD of hosts: and in this place
will I give peace, saith the LORD of hosts.

<span id="an_2:10">2:10</span> In the four and twentieth day of the
ninth month, in the second year of Darius, came the word of the LORD by
Haggai the prophet, saying,

<span id="an_2:11">2:11</span> Thus saith the LORD of hosts, Ask now the
priests concerning the law, saying,

<span id="an_2:12">2:12</span> If one shall bear holy flesh in the skirt
of his garment, and with his skirt shall touch bread, or pottage, or
wine, or oil, or any food, shall it be holy? And the priests answered
and said, No.

<span id="an_2:13">2:13</span> Then said Haggai, If one that is unclean
by a dead body shall touch any of these, shall it be unclean? And the
priests answered and said, It shall be unclean.

<span id="an_2:14">2:14</span> Then answered Haggai, and said, So is
this people, and so is this nation before me, saith the LORD; and so is
every work of their hands; and that which they offer there is unclean.

<span id="an_2:15">2:15</span> And now, I pray you, consider from this
day and upward, from before a stone was laid upon a stone in the temple
of the LORD:

<span id="an_2:16">2:16</span> Since those days were, when one came to a
heap of twenty measures, there were but ten: when one came to the
press-vat to draw out fifty vessels out of the press, there were but
twenty.

<span id="an_2:17">2:17</span> I smote you with blasting and with mildew
and with hail in all the labors of your hands; yet ye turned not to me,
saith the LORD.

<span id="an_2:18">2:18</span> Consider now from this day, and upward,
from the four and twentieth day of the ninth month, even from the day
that the foundation of the LORD'S temple was laid, consider it.

<span id="an_2:19">2:19</span> Is the seed yet in the barn? yes, as yet
the vine, and the fig-tree, and the pomegranate, and the olive-tree,
hath not brought forth: from this day will I bless you.

<span id="an_2:20">2:20</span> And again the word of the LORD came to
Haggai in the four and twentieth day of the month, saying,

<span id="an_2:21">2:21</span> Speak to Zerubbabel, governor of Judah,
saying, I will shake the heavens and the earth;

<span id="an_2:22">2:22</span> And I will overthrow the throne of
kingdoms, and I will destroy the strength of the kingdoms of the
heathen: and I will overthrow the chariots, and those that ride in them;
and the horses and their riders shall come down, every one by the sword
of his brother.

<span id="an_2:23">2:23</span> In that day, saith the LORD of hosts,
will I take thee, O Zerubbabel, my servant, the son of Shealtiel, saith
the LORD, and will make thee as a signet; for I have chosen thee, saith
the LORD of hosts.
