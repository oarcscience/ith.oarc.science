XLVI\. *The Head of Days and the Son of Man*.

### CHAPTER XLVI.

1\. And there I saw One who had a head of days,  
And His head was white like wool,  
And with Him was another being whose countenance had the appearance of a
man,  
And his face was full of graciousness, like one of the holy angels.

2\. And I asked the **angel** who went with me and showed me all the
hidden things, concerning that Son of Man, who he was, and whence he
was, (and)

<span id="page_64">p. 64</span>

why he went with the Head of Days? And he answered and said unto me:

This is the son of Man who hath righteousness,  
With whom dwelleth righteousness,  
And who revealeth all the treasures of that which is hidden,

Because the Lord of Spirits hath chosen him,  
And whose lot hath the pre-eminence before the Lord of Spirits in
uprightness for ever.

4, And this Son of Man whom thou hast seen  
Shall †raise up† the kings and the mighty from their seats,  
\[And the strong from their thrones\]

And shall loosen the reins of the strong,  
And break the teeth of the sinners.

5\. \[And he shall put down the kings from their thrones and
kingdoms\]  
Because they do not extol and praise Him,  
Nor humbly acknowledge whence the kingdom was bestowed upon them.  
6. And he shall put down the countenance of the strong,  
And shall fill them with shame.

And darkness shall be their dwelling,  
And worms shall be their bed,  
And they shall have no hope of rising from their beds,  
Because they do not extol the name of the Lord of Spirits.

7\. And these are they who †judge† the stars of heaven,  
\[And raise their hands against the Most High\],  
†And tread upon the earth and dwell upon it†.

And all their deeds manifest unrighteousness,  
And their power rests upon their riches, <span id="page_65">p.
65</span>  
And their faith is in the †gods† which they have made with their
hands,  
And they deny the name of the Lord of Spirits,

8\. And they persecute the houses of His congregations,  
And the faithful who hang upon the name of the Lord of Spirits.
