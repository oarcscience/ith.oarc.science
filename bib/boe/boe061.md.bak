LVIII-LXXI. **The Third Parable**.

LVIII\. *The Blessedness of the Saints*.

### CHAPTER LVIII.

1\. And I began to speak the third Parable concerning the righteous and
elect. <span id="page_75">p. 75</span>

2\. Blessed are ye, ye righteous and elect,  
For glorious shall be your lot.

3\. And the righteous shall be in the light of the sun.  
And the elect in the light of eternal life:  
The days of their life shall be unending,  
And the days of the holy without number.

4\. And they shall seek the light and find righteousness with the Lord
of Spirits:  
There shall be peace to the righteous in the name of the Eternal Lord.

5\. And after this it shall be said to the holy in heaven  
That they should seek out the secrets of righteousness, the heritage of
faith:  
For it has become bright as the sun upon earth,  
And the darkness is past.

6\. And there shall be a light that never **endeth**,  
And to a limit (lit. 'number') of days they shall not come,  
For the darkness shall first have been destroyed,  
\[And the light established before the Lord of Spirits\]  
And the light of uprightness established for ever before the Lord of
Spirits.
