LXXIX-LXXX. 1. *Recapitulation of several of the Laws*.

### CHAPTER LXXIX.

1\. And now, my son, I have shown thee everything, and the law of all
the stars of the heaven is completed. 2. And he showed me all the laws
of these for every day, and for every season of bearing rule, and for
every year, and for its going forth, and for the order prescribed to it
every month and every week: 3. And the waning of the moon which takes
place in the sixth portal: for in this sixth portal her light is
accomplished, and after that there is the beginning of the waning: 4.
〈And the waning〉 which takes place in the first portal in its season,
till one hundred and seventy-seven days are accomplished: reckoned
according to weeks, twenty-five (weeks) and two days. 5. She falls
behind the sun and the order of the stars exactly five days in the
course of one period, and when this place which thou seest has been
traversed. 6. Such is the picture and sketch of every luminary which
Uriel the archangel, who is their leader, showed unto me.
