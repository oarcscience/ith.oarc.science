XLVII\. *The Prayer of the Righteous for Vengeance and their Joy at its
coming*.

### CHAPTER XLVII.

1\. And in those days shall have ascended the prayer of the righteous,  
And the blood of the righteous from the earth before the Lord of
Spirits.  
2. In those days the holy ones who dwell above in the heavens  
Shall unite with one voice  
And supplicate and pray \[and praise,  
And give thanks and bless the name of the Lord of Spirits\]  
On behalf of the blood of the righteous which has been shed,  
And that the prayer of the righteous may not be in vain before the Lord
of Spirits,  
That judgement may be done unto them,  
And that they may not have to suffer for ever.  
3. In those days I saw the Head of Days when He seated himself upon the
throne of His glory,  
And the books of the living were opened before Him:  
And all His host which is in heaven above and His counselors stood
before Him,  
4 And the hearts of the holy were filled with joy;  
Because the number of the righteous **had been offered**,  
And the prayer of the righteous had been heard,  
And the blood of the righteous been required before the Lord of Spirits.
