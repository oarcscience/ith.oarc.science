XXIII\. *The Fire that deals with the Luminaries of Heaven*.

### CHAPTER XXIII.

1\. From thence I went to another place to the west of the ends of the
earth. 2. And I saw a ⌈⌈burning⌉⌉ fire which ran without resting, and
paused not from its course day or night but (ran) regularly. 3. And I
asked saying: 'What is this which rests not?' 4. Then Raguel, one of the
holy angels who was with me, answered me ⌈⌈and said unto me⌉⌉: 'This
course ⌈of fire⌉ ⌈⌈which thou hast seen⌉⌉ is the fire in the west which
†persecutes† all the luminaries of heaven.'
