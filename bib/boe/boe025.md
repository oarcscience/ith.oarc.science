XXII\. *Sheol, or the Underworld*.

### CHAPTER XXII.

1\. And thence I went to another place, and he showed me in the west
⌈another⌉ great and high mountain \[and\] of hard rock.

<p>2. And there were †four† hollow places in it, deep and very smooth: †three† of them were dark and one bright; and there was a fountain of water in its midst. And I said: '†How† smooth are these hollow places, and deep and dark to view.'</p></td>

3\. Then Raphael answered, one of the holy angels who was with me, and
said unto me: 'These hollow places have been created for this very
purpose, that the spirits of the souls of the dead should assemble
therein, yea that all the souls of the children of men should assemble
here. And these places **have**

appointed period ⌈till the period appointed⌉, till the great judgement
(comes) upon them.'

7\. And he answered me saying: 'This is the spirit which went forth from
Abel, whom his brother Cain slew, and he makes his suit against him till
his seed is destroyed from the face of the earth, and his seed is
annihilated from amongst the seed of men.'
