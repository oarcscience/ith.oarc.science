Jerusalem and the Mountains, Ravines and Streams.

### CHAPTER XXVI.

1\. And I went from thence to the middle of the earth, and I saw a
blessed place ⌈in which there were trees⌉ with branches abiding and
blooming \[of a dismembered tree\]. 2. And there I saw a holy mountain,
⌈⌈and⌉⌉ underneath the mountain to the east there was a stream and it
flowed towards the south. 3. And I saw towards the east another mountain
higher than this, and between them a deep and narrow ravine: in it also
ran a stream ⌈underneath⌉ the mountain. 4. And to the west thereof there
was another mountain, lower than the former and of small elevation, and
a ravine ⌈deep and dry⌉

between them: and another deep and dry ravine was at the extremities of
the three ⌈mountains⌉. 5. And all the ravines were deep ⌈⌈and narrow⌉⌉,
(being formed) of hard rock, and trees were not planted upon them. 6.
And I marveled ⌈⌈at the rocks, and I marveled⌉⌉ at the ravine, yea, I
marveled very much.
