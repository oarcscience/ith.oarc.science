### CHAPTER XIII.

1\. And Enoch went and said: 'Azâzêl,

<span id="page_40">p. 40</span>

thou shalt have no peace: a severe sentence has gone forth against thee
to put thee in bonds: 2. And thou shalt not have toleration nor
†request† granted to thee, because of the unrighteousness which thou
hast taught, and because of all the works of godlessness and
unrighteousness and sin which thou hast shown to men.' 3. Then I went
and spoke to them all together, and they were all afraid, and fear and
trembling seized them. 4. And they besought me to draw up a petition for
them that they might find forgiveness, and to read their petition in the
presence of the Lord of heaven. 5. For from thenceforward they could not
speak (with Him) nor lift up their eyes to heaven for shame of their
sins for which they had been condemned. 6. Then I wrote out their
petition, and the prayer in regard to their spirits and their deeds
individually and in regard to their requests that they should have
forgiveness and length 〈of days〉†. 7. And I went off and sat down at
the waters of Dan, in the land of Dan, to the south of the west of
Hermon: I read their petition till I fell asleep. 8. And behold a dream
came to me, and visions fell down upon me, and I saw visions of
chastisement, ⌈and a voice came bidding (me)⌉ I to tell it to the sons
of heaven, and reprimand them. 9. And when I awaked, I came unto them,
and they were all sitting gathered together, weeping in ’Abelsjâîl,
which is between Lebanon and Sênêsêr, with their faces covered. 10. And
I recounted before them all the visions which I had seen in sleep, and I
began to speak the words of righteousness, and to reprimand the heavenly
Watchers.
