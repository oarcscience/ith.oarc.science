### CHAPTER LIV.

1 And I looked and turned to another part of the earth, and saw there a
deep valley with burning fire. 2. And they brought the kings and the
mighty, and began to cast them into this deep valley. 3. And there mine
eyes saw how they made these their instruments, iron chains of
immeasurable weight. 4. And I asked the angel of peace who went with me,
saying: 'For whom are these chains being prepared?'

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> 5. And he said
unto me: 'These are being prepared for the hosts of Azâzêl, so that they
may take them and cast them into the abyss of complete condemnation, and
they shall cover their jaws with rough stones as the Lord of Spirits
commanded.

6\. And Michael, and Gabriel, and Raphael, and Phanuel shall take hold
of them on that great day, and cast them on that day into the burning
furnace, that the Lord of Spirits may take vengeance on them for their
unrighteousness in becoming subject to Satan and leading astray those
who dwell on the earth.'

LIV\. 7.-LV 2. *Noachic Fragment on the first World Judgement*.

7\. 'And in those days shall punishment come from the Lord of Spirits,
and he will open all the chambers of waters which are above the heavens,
and of the fountains which are beneath the earth. 8. And all the waters
shall be joined with the waters: that which is above the heavens is the
masculine, and the water which is beneath the earth is the feminine. 9.
And they shall destroy all who dwell on the earth and those who dwell
under the ends of the heaven. 10. And **when** they have recognized
their unrighteousness which they have wrought on the earth, then by
these shall they perish.
