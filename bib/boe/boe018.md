### CHAPTER XV.

1\. And He answered and said to me, and I heard His voice: 'Fear not,
Enoch, thou righteous man and scribe of righteousness: approach hither
and hear my voice. 2. And go, say to ⌈⌈the Watchers of heaven⌉⌉, who
have sent thee to intercede ⌈⌈for them: "You should intercede"⌉⌉ for
men, and not men for you: 3. Wherefore have ye left the high, holy, and
eternal heaven, and lain with women, and defiled yourselves with the
daughters of men and taken to yourselves wives, and done like the
children of earth, and begotten giants (as your) sons? 4. And

<span id="page_43">p. 43</span>

though ye were holy, spiritual, living the eternal life, you have
defiled yourselves with the blood of women, and have begotten (children)
with the blood of flesh, and, **as the children** of men, have lusted
after flesh and blood as those ⌈also⌉ do who die and perish. 5.
Therefore have I given them wives also that they might impregnate them,
and beget children by them, that thus nothing might be wanting to them
on earth. 6. But you were ⌈formerly⌉ spiritual, living the eternal life,
and immortal for all generations of the world. 7. And therefore I have
not appointed wives for you; for as for the spiritual ones of the
heaven, in heaven is their dwelling. 8. And now, the giants, who are
produced from the spirits and flesh, shall be called evil spirits upon
the earth, and on the earth shall be their dwelling. 9. Evil spirits
have proceeded from their bodies; because they are born from **men**,
⌈⌈and⌉⌉ from the holy Watchers is their beginning and primal origin;
⌈they shall be evil spirits on earth, and⌉ evil spirits shall they be
called. \[10. As for the spirits of heaven, in heaven shall be their
dwelling, but as for the spirits of the earth which were born upon the
earth, on the earth shall be their dwelling.\] 11. And the spirits of
the giants **afflict**, oppress, destroy, attack, do battle, and work
destruction on the earth, and cause trouble: they take no food, ⌈but
nevertheless hunger⌉ and thirst, and cause offences. And these spirits
shall rise up against the children of men and against the women, because
they have proceeded ⌈from them⌉.
