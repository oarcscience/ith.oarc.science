LXXXVIII\. *The Punishment of the Fallen Angels by the Archangels*.

### CHAPTER LXXXVIII.

1\. And I saw one of those four who had come forth first, and he seized
that first star which had fallen from the heaven, and bound it hand and

foot and cast it into an abyss: now that abyss was narrow and deep, and
horrible and dark. 2. And one of them drew a sword, and gave it to those
elephants and camels and asses: then they began to smite each other, and
the whole earth quaked because of them. 3. And as I was beholding in the
vision, lo, one of those four who had come forth stoned (them) from
heaven, and gathered and took all the great stars whose privy members
were like those of horses, and bound them all hand and foot, and cast
them in an abyss of the earth.
