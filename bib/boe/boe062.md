LIX\. *The Lights and the Thunder*.

### CHAPTER LIX.

\[1. In those days mine eyes saw the secrets of the lightnings, and of
the lights, and the judgements they execute (lit. 'their judgement'):
and they lighten for a blessing or a curse as the Lord of Spirits
willeth. 2. And there I saw the secrets of the thunder, and how when it
resounds above in the heaven, the sound thereof is heard, and he caused
me to see the judgements executed on the earth, whether they be for
well-being and blessing, or for a curse according to the word of the
Lord of Spirits. 3. And after that all the secrets of the lights and
lightnings were shown to me, and they lighten for blessing and for
satisfying.\]
