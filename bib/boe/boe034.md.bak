### CHAPTER XXXI.

1\. And I saw other mountains, and amongst them were ⌈groves of⌉ trees,
and there flowed forth from them nectar, which is named sarara and
galbanum. 2. And beyond these mountains I saw another mountain ⌈to the
east of the ends of the earth⌉, ⌈⌈whereon were aloe trees⌉⌉, and all the
trees were full **of stacte**, being like almond-trees. 3. And when one
**burnt** it, it smelt sweeter than any fragrant odour.
