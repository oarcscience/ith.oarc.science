XXVII\. *The Purpose of the Accursed Valley*.

### CHAPTER XXVII.

1\. Then said I: 'For what object is this blessed land, which is
entirely filled with trees, and this accursed valley ⌈⌈between⌉⌉?' 2.
⌈⌈Then Uriel, one of the holy angels who was with me, answered and said:
'This⌉⌉ accursed valley is for those who are accursed for ever: Here
shall all ⌈the accursed⌉ be gathered together who utter with their lips
against the Lord unseemly words and of His glory speak hard things.

4\. In the days of judgement over the former, they shall bless Him for
the mercy in accordance with which He has assigned them (their lot).' 5.
Then I blessed the Lord of Glory and set forth His ⌈glory⌉ and lauded
Him gloriously.
