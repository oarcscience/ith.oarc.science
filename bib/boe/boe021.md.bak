### CHAPTER XVIII

1\. I saw the treasuries of all the winds: I saw how He had furnished
with them the whole creation and the firm foundations of the earth. 2.
And I saw the corner-stone of the earth: I saw the four winds which bear
\[the earth and\] the firmament of the heaven. 3. ⌈⌈And I saw how the
winds stretch out the vaults of heaven⌉⌉, and have their station between
heaven and earth: ⌈⌈these are the

<span id="page_45">p. 45</span>

pillars of the heaven⌉⌉. 4. I saw the winds of heaven which turn and
bring the circumference of the sun and all the stars to their setting.
5. I saw the winds on the earth carrying the clouds: I saw ⌈⌈the paths
of the angels. I saw⌉⌉ at the end of the earth the firmament of the
heaven above. And I proceeded and saw a place which burns day and night,
where there are seven mountains of magnificent stones, three towards the
east, and three towards the south. 7. And as for those towards the east,
〈one〉 was of coloured stone, and one of pearl, and one of **jacinth**,
and those towards the south of red stone. 8. But the middle one reached
to heaven like the throne of God, of alabaster, and the summit of the
throne was of sapphire. 9. And I saw a flaming fire. And beyond these
mountains 10. is a region the end of the great earth: there the heavens
were completed. 11. And I saw a deep abyss, with columns ⌈⌈of heavenly
fire, and among them I saw columns⌉⌉ of fire fall, which were beyond
measure alike towards the height and towards the depth. 12. And beyond
that abyss I saw a place which had no firmament of the heaven above, and
no firmly founded earth beneath it: there was no water upon it, and no
birds, but it was a waste and horrible place. 13. I saw there seven
stars like great burning mountains, and to me, when I inquired regarding
them, 14. The angel said: 'This place is the end of heaven and earth:
this has become a prison for the stars and the host of heaven. 15. And
the stars which roll over the fire are they which have transgressed the
commandment of the Lord in the beginning of their rising, because they
did not come forth at their appointed times. 16. And He was wroth with
them, and bound them till the time when their guilt should be
consummated (even) ⌈for ten thousand years⌉.'
