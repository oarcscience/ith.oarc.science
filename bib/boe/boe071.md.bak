LXVIII\. *Michael and Raphael [astonished](errata.htm#0.md) at the Severity
of the Judgement*.

### CHAPTER LXVIII.

1\. And after that my grandfather Enoch gave me the teaching of all the
secrets in the book in the Parables which had been given to him, and he
put them together for me in the words of the book of the Parables. 2.
And on that day Michael answered Raphael and said: 'The power of the
spirit transports and **makes me to tremble** because of the severity of
the judgement of the secrets, the judgement of the angels: who can
endure the severe judgement which has been executed, and before which
they melt away?' 3. And Michael answered again, and said to Raphael:
'Who is he whose heart is not softened concerning it, and whose reins
are not troubled by this word of judgement (that) has gone forth upon
them because of those who have thus led them out?' 4. And it came to
pass when he stood before the Lord of Spirits, Michael said thus to
Raphael: 'I will not

take their part under the eye of the Lord; for the Lord of Spirits has
been angry with them because they do as if they were the Lord. Therefore
all that is hidden shall come upon them for ever and ever; for neither
angel nor man shall have his portion (in it), but alone they have
received their judgement for ever and ever.'
