### CHAPTER XIX.

1\. And Uriel said to me: 'Here shall stand the angels who have
connected themselves with women, and their spirits assuming many
different forms are defiling mankind and shall lead them astray

<span id="page_46">p. 46</span>

into sacrificing to demons ⌈⌈as gods⌉⌉, (here shall they stand,) till
⌈⌈the day of⌉⌉ the great judgement in which they shall be judged till
they are made an end of. 2. And the women also of the angels who went
astray shall become sirens.' 3. And I, Enoch, alone saw the vision, the
ends of all things: and no man shall see as I have seen.
