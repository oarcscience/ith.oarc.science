LXXXI\. *The Heavenly Tablets and the Mission of Enoch*.

### CHAPTER LXXXI.

1\. And he said unto me:  
'Observe, Enoch, these heavenly tablets,  
And read what is written thereon,  
And mark every individual fact.'

2 And I observed the heavenly tablets, and read everything which was
written (thereon) and understood everything, and read the book of all
the deeds of mankind, and of all the children of flesh that shall be
upon the earth to the remotest generations. 3. And forthwith I blessed
the great Lord the King of glory for ever, in that He has made all the
works of the world,

And I extolled the Lord because of His patience,  
And blessed Him because of the children of men.

4\. And after that I said:  
'Blessed is the man who dies in righteousness and goodness,  
Concerning whom there is no book of unrighteousness written,  
And against whom no day of judgement shall be found.'

5\. And those seven holy ones brought me and placed me on the earth
before the door of my house, and said to me: 'Declare everything to thy
son Methuselah, and show to all thy children that no flesh is righteous
in the sight of the Lord, for He is their Creator. 6. One year we will
leave thee with thy son, till thou givest thy (last) commands, that thou
mayest teach thy children and record (it) for them, and testify to all
thy children; and in the second year they shall take thee from their
midst.

7\. Let thy heart be strong,  
For the good shall announce righteousness to the good;

The righteous with the righteous shall rejoice,  
And shall offer congratulation to one another.

8\. But the sinners shall die with the sinners,  
And the apostate go down with the apostate.

9\. And those who practice righteousness shall die on account of the
deeds of men,  
And be taken away on account of the doings of the godless.'

10\. And in those days they ceased to speak to me, and I came to my
people, blessing the Lord of the world.
