### CHAPTER LV.

1\. And after that the Head of Days repented and said: 'In vain have I
destroyed all who dwell on the earth.' 2. And He sware by His great
name: 'Henceforth I will not do so to all who dwell on the earth, and I
will set a sign in the heaven: and this shall be a pledge of good faith
between Me and them for ever, so long as heaven is above the earth. And
this is in accordance with My command.'

LV\. 3-LVI. 4. *Final Judgement of Azâzêl, the Watchers and their
children*.

3\. When I have desired to take hold of them by the hand of the angels
on the day of tribulation and pain **because of** this, I will cause My
chastisement and My wrath to abide upon them, saith God, the Lord of
Spirits. 4. Ye †mighty kings† who dwell on the earth, ye shall have to
behold Mine Elect One, how he sits on the throne of glory and judges
Azâzêl, and all his associates, and all his hosts in the name of the
Lord of Spirits.'
