beasts, and each differed from the other; and (I saw) birds also
differing in appearance and beauty and voice, the one differing from the
other. 2. And to the east of those beasts I saw the ends of the earth
whereon the heaven rests, and the portals of the heaven open. 3. And I
saw how the stars of heaven come forth, and I counted the portals out of
which they proceed, and wrote down all their outlets, of each individual
star by itself, according to their number and their names, their courses
and their positions, and their times and their months, as Uriel the holy
angel who was with me showed me. 4. He showed all things to me

and wrote them down for me: also their names he wrote for me, and their
laws and their companies.
