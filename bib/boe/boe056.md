LIII\. LVI. 6. *The Valley of Judgement: the Angels of Punishment: the
Communities of the Elect One*.

### CHAPTER LIII.

1\. There mine eyes saw a deep valley with open mouths, and all who
dwell on the earth and sea and islands shall bring to him gifts and
presents and tokens of homage, but that deep valley shall not become
full.

2\. And their hands commit lawless deeds,  
And the sinners devour all whom they lawlessly **oppress**:  
Yet the sinners shall be destroyed before the face of the Lord of
Spirits,  
And they shall be banished from off the face of His earth,  
And they shall perish for ever and ever.

3\. For I saw all the angels of punishment abiding (there) and preparing
all the instruments of Satan. 4. And I asked the angel of peace who went
with me: 'For whom are they preparing these instruments?' 5. And he said
unto me: 'They prepare these for the kings and the mighty of this earth,
that they may thereby be destroyed.

6\. And after this the Righteous and Elect One shall cause the house of
his congregation to appear: henceforth they shall be no more hindered in
the name of the Lord of Spirits.

7\. And these mountains shall not stand as the earth before his
righteousness,  
But the hills shall be as a fountain of water,  
And the righteous shall have rest from the oppression of sinners.'
