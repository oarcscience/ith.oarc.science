XXXIV\. XXXV. *Enoch's Journey to the North*.

### CHAPTER XXXIV.

1\. And from thence I went towards the north to the ends of the earth,
and there I saw a great and glorious device at the ends of the whole
earth. 2. And here I saw three portals of heaven open in the heaven:
through each of them proceed north winds: when they blow there is cold,
hail, frost, snow, dew, and rain. 3. And out of one portal they blow for
good: but when they blow through the other two portals, it is with
violence and affliction on the earth, and they blow with violence.
