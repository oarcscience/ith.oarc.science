XLIII\. XLIV. *Astronomical Secrets*.

### CHAPTER XLIII.

1\. And I saw other lightnings and the stars of heaven, and I saw how He
called them all by their names and they hearkened unto Him. 2. And I saw
how they are weighed in a righteous balance according to their
proportions of light: (I saw) the width of their spaces and the day of
their appearing, and how their revolution produces lightning: and (I
saw) their revolution according to the number of the angels, and (how)
they keep faith with each other. 3. And I asked the angel who went with
me who showed me what was hidden: 'What are these?' 4. And he said to
me: 'The Lord of Spirits hath showed thee their parabolic meaning (lit.
'their parable'): these are the names of the holy who dwell on the earth
and believe in the name of the Lord of Spirits for ever and ever.'
