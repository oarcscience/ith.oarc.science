#### § 16. The Case of Apollonius of Tyana.

As regards the historical argument it may be well, finally, to
anticipate an objection which may be grounded on the admission that
Apollonius of Tyana, who has been plausibly described as a Pagan
Christ, <span id="fr_1369"></span>[7](#fn_1369.md) was really a historic
personage, though his life is clothed upon with myth from birth to
death. Here, it may be

<span id="page_275">p. 275</span>

argued, was a real man, who had lived in the first century of the
Christian era, represented in the third as born under supernatural
circumstances, working miracles, making disciples and converts by his
teaching in Europe and Asia, and finally ascending to heaven. If these
prodigies could be told of an actual man, it may be asked, why may not
Jesus be actual, of whom similar prodigies are told?

The answer is, as aforesaid, that the ascription of prodigies to any
ancient personage is not in itself a disproof of his historicity; but
that the historical evidence in each case is to be taken on its total
merits. It is at bottom the same mythopœic bias that rings with myth the
mere name of a phantom God or Demi-God and the slightly known life of a
remarkable man; and the task of criticism is to distinguish cases by
impartial tests. We hold Charlemagne and Theodoric and Virgil for
historical, despite the myths connected with them in the Middle Ages.
The case of Apollonius belongs broadly to the same class, as perhaps
does that of Solomon.

It is needless here to remark that the abundant attribution of miracles
to Apollonius soon after his own day proves the valuelessness of miracle
stories as certificates of divinity: these pages are written for
students who have put aside the belief in miracles; and when Christian
Fathers are found, in the case of Apollonius, attributing to demons the
pagan prodigies which they do not deny to have occurred, we have merely
to note how absolute was the credulity of the time in regard to any
story of strange happenings. They, it is clear, never thought of testing
as to whether Apollonius was a real person: they took it for granted
that the name of a person said to have existed stood for a real person.
Are we, then, entitled to follow their example? The answer is that in
the case of Apollonius we have no reason for suspecting invention, <span
id="fr_1370"></span>[1](#fn_1370.md) save as regards the details of the
biography recast for us by Philostratus in the third century. There even
the "credible" data are uncertain. But it is likely enough that he was,
as there represented, a devout Pythagorean, a vegetarian, an ascetic, a
student of medicine and astrology, universalist in his creed, and a
believer in immortality. And he may conceivably have travelled to India,
though the details offered us are naught. <span
id="fr_1371"></span>[2](#fn_1371.md)

As usual, indeed, there lacks contemporary testimony, apart from that
preserved in Philostratus. The Life makes Apollonius die about the reign
of Nerva (96-98 C.E.); and our first incidental

<span id="page_276">p. 276</span>

traces of his fame are in Dio Cassius, <span
id="fr_1372"></span>[1](#fn_1372.md) where he is mentioned as a miraculous
seer, and in Origen's reply to Celsus, <span
id="fr_1373"></span>[2](#fn_1373.md) where one Moiragenes (mentioned by
Philostratus) is cited as referring to the accounts of magical feats in
the memoirs of Apollonius, and observing that some philosophers of note
had been convinced by them. These references belong to the very period
of the production of the Life by Philostratus, so that there is no trace
of any impression previously made by the memoirs of Damis and Maximus of
Ægæ, declared to be used by him. Still, we have no reason for doubting
that there was an Apollonius of Tyana, who made an impression in his own
day as a wandering teacher, and perhaps as a sorcerer, and whose memory
was preserved by statues in several towns, as well as by one or two
memoirs, one of them written by his credulous or mendacious disciple,
Damis. Of the large number of letters preserved as his, some of them
remarkable for their terse force, it is impossible to be sure that they
are genuine, though they may very well be so.

The reasons for not doubting on the main point are (1) that there was no
cause to be served by fabrication; and (2) that it was a much easier
matter to take a known name as a nucleus for a mass of marvels and
teachings than to build it up, as the phrase goes about the cannon,
"round a hole." The difference between such a case and those of Jesuism
and Buddhism is obvious. In those cases, there was a cultus and an
organisation to be accounted for, and a biography of the Founder had to
be forthcoming. In the case of Apollonius, despite the string of marvels
attached to his name, there was no cultus. Posterity was interested in
him as it was in Pythagoras or Plato; and Philostratus undertook the
recasting of the Life in literary form at the command of the empress
Julia Domna, a great eclectic. Even if, as has been so often argued,
from Huet and Cudworth to Baur and A. Réville, <span
id="fr_1374"></span>[3](#fn_1374.md) there was an original intention to
set-off Apollonius against Jesus, we should not have ground to doubt
that a teaching Apollonius had flourished in the first century: rather
the presumption would be that the pagans would seek for some famous
wonderworker whose life they could manipulate.

But there is really no reason to suppose that Philostratus, much less
Damis, had the gospels before him, though he may well have

<span id="page_277">p. 277</span>

heard of their story. A close comparison of the story of the raising of
Jairus’ daughter with the story in Philostratus, to which it is so
closely parallel, gives rather reason to believe that the gospels copied
the pagan narrative, the gospel story being left unmentioned by Arnobius
and Lactantius in lists in which they ought to have given it had they
known and accepted it. <span id="fr_1375"></span>[1](#fn_1375.md) The
story, however, was probably told of other thaumaturgs before
Apollonius; and in regard to the series of often strained parallels
drawn by Baur, as by Huet, it may confidently be said that, instead of
their exhibiting any calculated attempt to outdo or cap the gospel
narratives, they stand for the general taste of the time in thaumaturgy.
Apollonius, like Jesus, casts out devils and heals the sick; and if the
Life were a parody of the gospel we should expect him to give sight to
the blind. This, however, is not the case; and on the other hand the
gospel story of the healing of two blind men is certainly a duplicate of
a pagan record. <span id="fr_1376"></span>[2](#fn_1376.md)

To say, as does Baur, that the casting-out of devils in the Apollonian
legend is necessarily an echo of the gospels, on the score that the
Greek and Roman literatures at that time show no traces of the
idea, <span id="fr_1377"></span>[3](#fn_1377.md) is to make the arbitrary
assumption that the superstitions of Syria could enter the West only by
Judaic or Christian channels. The "Metamorphoses" of Apuleius, to say
nothing of those of Ovid, might serve to remind us that the empire
imbibed the *diablerie* of the East at every pore; and the wizardry of
Apollonius includes many eastern items of which the gospels show no
trace. As for the annunciation of the birth of Apollonius by Proteus,
and the manner of its happening, they conform alike to Egyptian myths
and to that told concerning the birth of Plato. <span
id="fr_1378"></span>[4](#fn_1378.md) It is, in fact, the Christian myth
that draws upon the common store of Greek and Syrian myth, not the
Apollonian legend that borrows from the Christian. The descent of
Apollonius to Hades, again, seems to have been alleged, after common
Græco-Asiatic precedent, before the same myth became part of the
Christian dogmatic code; and to say that his final disappearance without
dying and his apparition afterwards must have been motived by the story
of Christ's appearing to Saul <span id="fr_1379"></span>[5](#fn_1379.md) is
once more to ignore the whole lesson of comparative hierology. Baur goes
so far as to argue <span id="fr_1380"></span>[6](#fn_1380.md) that when
Philostratus says the disciples of Apollonius in Greece were called
Apollonians,

<span id="page_278">p. 278</span>

he must be merely framing a parallel to the title of the Christians,
because there is now no knowledge of a sect of Apollonians. It was very
hard, two generations ago, for even a great scholar to realise the
broadest laws of religious evolution. Yet Lardner had shown with
reasonable force, in his primitive fashion, nearly a century before,
that the model before Philostratus, if there be any, is not Jesus but
Pythagoras; <span id="fr_1381"></span>[1](#fn_1381.md) and his friend De la
Roche had rightly and tersely summed up the whole case in the words:
"Philostratus said nothing more in the Life of Apollonius than he would
have said if there had been no Christians in the world." <span
id="fr_1382"></span>[2](#fn_1382.md) For once, Baur had not fully grappled
with the literature of his subject. <span
id="fr_1383"></span>[3](#fn_1383.md) His superiority to his Christian
predecessors as a critic of Apollonius comes out chiefly in his gravely
candid recognition <span id="fr_1384"></span>[4](#fn_1384.md) of the high
moral purpose set forth in all the discourses ascribed to the hero in
the Life.

The habit of pitting Apollonius against Jesus really arose about a
century after Philostratus, when the pagan intelligence first began to
feel itself menaced by the new creed. Hierocles set the fashion in his
*Philalethes Logos*, to which Eusebius and Lactantius <span
id="fr_1385"></span>[5](#fn_1385.md) replied in the normal patristic
manner. A hundred years later still, in the time of Augustine, the
setting of the miracles of Apollonius and Apuleius against those of
Jesus was a common line of pagan argument, <span
id="fr_1386"></span>[6](#fn_1386.md) met in the usual way, neither side
convincing the other. If there was any gain, it was on the pagan side;
for while Chrysostom <span id="fr_1387"></span>[7](#fn_1387.md) triumphs
over the failure of the Apollonian movement, such a classically cultured
Christian bishop as Sidonius Apollinaris <span
id="fr_1388"></span>[8](#fn_1388.md) acclaims the personal virtues and
philosophic teaching of the pagan sage. The pagans on their part had
taken him up all round. In the day of Philostratus, Alexander Severus
had eclectically placed a bust of Apollonius, with others of Abraham,
Jesus, and Orpheus, in his private chapel or oratory; <span
id="fr_1389"></span>[9](#fn_1389.md) and later we find Eunapius, <span
id="fr_1390"></span>[10](#fn_1390.md) Ammianus Marcellinus, <span
id="fr_1391"></span>[11](#fn_1391.md) Vopiscus, <span
id="fr_1392"></span>[12](#fn_1392.md) and Apuleius, <span
id="fr_1393"></span>[13](#fn_1393.md) from their different standpoints

<span id="page_279">p. 279</span>

treating the Tyanean as a demigod, or divinely inspired, or a supreme
Mage.

It was not, of course, the high ethic and philosophy of the Apollonian
discourses that they stressed as against the Christians. Such a saying
as "I have found my reward in the amendment of men" <span
id="fr_1394"></span>[1](#fn_1394.md) was not a word to conjure with in
popular debate. It was the miracles, the prodigies, the fables, that
were for ancient readers the warrant of the sage's greatness. To-day we
cannot tell any more than they to what extent the remarkable discourses
which Philostratus professes to copy from Damis stand for any genuine
utterances or writings of Apollonius: <span
id="fr_1395"></span>[2](#fn_1395.md) we can be satisfied of the historicity
of the man without knowing how far to trust the accounts of his travels
and teaching. But we know that if Apollonius had uttered every wise or
eloquent teaching put in his mouth by his biographers he could not
thereby have founded such a cult as the Christians conducted on the
basis of an entirely fictitious biography.

Lactantius, in the patristic style, asks Hierocles: "Why therefore, O
mad head, doth none worship Apollonius for a God, unless perchance thou
alone, worthy indeed of that God, with whom the true God will punish
thee to all eternity?" <span id="fr_1396"></span>[3](#fn_1396.md) We to-day
can give the answer of hierology. No man was ever perdurably deified for
his wisdom, or even for his supposed miracles: religions grow up around
rites offered immemorially to unknown powers, or round ways of life set
up by generations of nameless teachers, all of which abstractions alike
take form as named Gods or Sons of Gods, who in one age are the givers
of civilisation, agriculture, knowledge, crafts, arts, rites, and laws,
and in another of oracles, of revelations, of doctrines and discourses,
of their own lives as redeemers. But the really slain man, the true
human sacrifice, though he be counted by millions, is not deified: not
he, but an abstraction shaped out of the mystic drama and sacrament
which have followed on ages of sacrifices and sacraments of human flesh;
and neither is the true teacher or thinker deified: not he, but a
superposed abstraction distilled from many teachings, wise or unwise,
put by many generations in the mouth of the mythical one. For it is by
such modes alone that men have been able to create the economic bases
without which no

<span id="page_280">p. 280</span>

religion can live. Apollonius, credited with many miracles and wondrous
wisdom, like Pythagoras long before him, could become a God only by way
of a passing figure of speech, precisely because he had really lived and
taught.

Given the culture-stage in which many crave the Teaching God, while the
multitude still crave the Sacrificed God, a cult which shall combine
these in one Deity, still retaining the cosmic Creator God and adding
the attractive appeal of the Mother Goddess, has obviously a maximum
chance of survival. And such a religion, we have seen reason to
conclude, cannot be founded on concrete personages: it must be developed
from personalised abstractions. Such a combination is presented in the
Christian cultus. But all such success is finally in terms of political
and economic adaptations; and the final explanation of non-survivals,
accordingly, is to be found in the lack or frustration of such
adaptations. It remains to note, then, how systems historically
developed from abstractions like the Christian have disappeared in the
struggle for existence.
