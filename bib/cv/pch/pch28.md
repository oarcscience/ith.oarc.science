# PART II.

# SECONDARY GOD-MAKING

### CHAPTER I.

### THE SACRIFICED SAVIOUR-GOD

#### § 1. Totemism and Sacraments.

<span class="smallcaps">There</span> is an arguable case for the theory
that the belief in a dying and re-arising Saviour-God, seen anciently in
the cults of Adonis, Attis, Herakles, Osiris, and Dionysos, originated
obscurely in the totem-sacraments of savages who ate a sacred animal in
order to preserve their identity of species with it. <span
id="fr_377"></span>[1](#fn_377.md) There is, however, a much stronger case
for the simpler theory that the belief in question originated on another
line in the practice of sacrificing by way of sympathetic magic a victim
who, as such, became a God, but was not supposed to rise again in his
own person. <span id="fr_378"></span>[2](#fn_378.md) The first of these
theories is in the nature of the case incapable of proof; <span
id="fr_379"></span>[3](#fn_379.md) and it is not necessary, for a rational
comparison and appreciation of the historic cults, to establish it, any
more than to assume that either derivation excludes the other. We should
profit little by our knowledge of the manifold God-making powers of
early man if we supposed that any given Saviour-cult could originate
only in such a line or lines of descent; and in point of fact the
proposal to hark back to totemism seems to overlook the fact that a
sacramental meal ostensibly can originate apart from totemism.

It is not plausible to suppose, for instance, that the eating of bread
in a primitive eucharist implied that the partakers originally

<span id="page_100">p. 100</span>

had the corn for their special totem; <span
id="fr_380"></span>[1](#fn_380.md) or (supposing the God Dionysos to have
been a simple deification of the sacramental Soma or Haoma, as Agni was
of the sacrificial fire) <span id="fr_381"></span>[2](#fn_381.md) to
conclude that the first Soma-drinkers made their ritual beverage on the
score that they were of the grape or any analogous totem. Both
inductively and deductively we seem rather led to conclude that totems
might or might not be sacramentally eaten; and that animals like men
might be sacramentally eaten without any reference to totemism. It is
apt to be forgotten that at bottom the word "sacred" (*hieros*) equates
with "taboo"; and that an animal might be made taboo for a variety of
reasons—as being too valuable to kill, or as being unwholesome, or as
being for occasional killing only.

On the difficult subject of totemism, the suggestion may here be
incidentally offered that the totem was in origin merely the group's way
of *naming* itself. <span id="fr_382"></span>[3](#fn_382.md) Such
group-names were as necessary as individual names; and while a person
could readily be labelled from the place of his birth or any family
incident at that period, or by a physical or moral peculiarity, clans of
the same stock could with difficulty be distinguished in the nomadic
state save by arbitrary names, which could best be drawn from the list
of natural objects. Indeed, it is hard to conceive how otherwise nomadic
clans could first name themselves. What other vocables were
available? <span id="fr_383"></span>[4](#fn_383.md) Spencer's suggestion
that totemism originated in misinterpretation of nicknames <span
id="fr_384"></span>[5](#fn_384.md) raises the difficulty that *nick*names
presuppose *names*. Spencer fully realises this in the case of
individuals, but overlooks it in the case of the *group*, since he
apparently supposes the tribal totem-name to come through the nickname
of an already-named individual. When we realise that for sheer lack of
other words the

<span id="page_101">p. 101</span>

early group could hardly have any name whatever save from a natural
object, and when we so recast the explanation, the objection which meets
the first form of the nickname theory—that it ascribes too much latitude
to verbal misunderstanding <span id="fr_385"></span>[1](#fn_385.md)—falls
to the ground. In the primitive state, we must presume, objects and
actions were first named by onomatopœia, or else, sensations and actions
being first so named, objects were metaphorically named from sensations
and actions; <span id="fr_386"></span>[2](#fn_386.md) and so with
attributes. A definite doctrine as to beginnings is hard to justify, and
is not here essential: it suffices to realise that objects would be
somehow named before individuals and groups were, whether or not
individuals were named before groups. And while persons might readily be
named or nicknamed Tall or Short, Straight or Crooked, Quick or Slow,
tribes could only in rare instances be so distinguished; while nothing
would be more easy than for one family or clan to say to another, You
are the Wolves, we the Bears; you the Trees, we the Birds, and so
on. <span id="fr_387"></span>[3](#fn_387.md)

Some such agreement would be necessary; for the mere bestowal of names
of whim or derision by *groups or clans* on each other—sometimes
suggested as an explanation of the phenomenon—would yield a multitude of
names for each group. <span id="fr_388"></span>[4](#fn_388.md) The same
difficulty meets Spencer's theory that the belief in animal descent came
through a nickname, and the totem symbol from that. Spencer, I repeat,
had not fully considered the special conditions of the naming of
*groups*. His correction of common assumptions as to the naming of
individuals <span id="fr_389"></span>[5](#fn_389.md) is important, though
it is perhaps precarious in respect of the assumption that contemporary
savage ways of naming children were primordial; but there is a clear
hiatus between his doctrine of individual names and nicknames, and his
suggestion as to tribal totem-names. He merely rejects other
explanations without justifying his own. "Why," he asks," <span
id="fr_390"></span>[6](#fn_390.md) did there occur so *purely gratuitous*
an act as that of fixing on a symbol for the tribe? That by one tribe
out of multitudes *so strange a whim* might be displayed is credible.
But that by tribes unallied in type and scattered throughout the world,
there should have been independently adopted *so odd a practice*, is
incredible." Now, the naming of groups is no more gratuitous or strange
than the naming of individuals: groups needed to name themselves and
each other as such, just as individuals did; and as Spencer admits
animal-nicknames to be natural, <span id="fr_391"></span>[7](#fn_391.md) he

<span id="page_102">p. 102</span>

cannot well deny animal names to be natural in the case of clans or
tribes. If there is anything certain about early man it is that he
regarded animals as on a level with him, and all objects as possibly
animate. For tribal purposes, then, these *were* the natural names; and
a formal agreement would be required for their adoption. In no other way
could groups speak *with* each other *about* each other, at least when
they became numerous. And until fixed dwellings or hamlets did away with
the need, the expedient would subsist for the reason for which it began.

This period, however, would be immensely long, and the memory of the
genesis would infallibly be lost. Given the original circumstances,
"verbal misunderstanding" was thus inevitable. <span
id="fr_392"></span>[1](#fn_392.md) When, that is to say, the comparatively
early savage learned that he was "a Bear," and that his father and
grandfather and forefathers were so before him, it was really impossible
that, after ages in which totem names thus passed current, he should
fail to assume that his folk were descended from a bear, which as a
matter of course became at a later stage an Ancestor-God. <span
id="fr_393"></span>[2](#fn_393.md) The belief was inevitable precisely
because the totem was *not* a nickname, but a name antecedent to
nicknames; and because descent from an animal was the easiest way of
explaining or conceiving a "beginning" of men. And while some totem
names might conceivably have been chosen by way of striking up a helpful
alliance with an animal family, <span id="fr_394"></span>[3](#fn_394.md)
the fact that the list of totems includes sand, sparrows, pigeons, bats,
and so on, is hardly open to that interpretation; while the principle of
simply naming *from an already-named object* seems to meet all cases
alike.

Such a procedure has actually been noted among the contemporary natives
of the island of Efati in the New Hebrides, where "the people are all
divided into families or clans, each of which has a distinctive name,
such as *manui*, the cocoa-nut, *namkatu*......a species of yam, *naui*,
the yam," etc. <span id="fr_395"></span>[4](#fn_395.md) Similarly the
exogamous

<span id="page_103">p. 103</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> "classes" of the
Australian tribes are always named from animals, plants, objects,
etc.; <span id="fr_396"></span>[1](#fn_396.md) and in most of the tribes of
West Africa there are some men with a totem surname who with men of the
same surname in other tribes claim a common descent from the original
totem. <span id="fr_397"></span>[2](#fn_397.md) Livingstone noted the same
usage among the Bechuanas, whole tribes being known as "they of the
monkey," <span id="fr_398"></span>[3](#fn_398.md) and so on—a state of
things in which the cognomen could be carried from any one tribe into
others. So among the Narrinyeri of South Australia, "every tribe has its
*ngaitye*, that is, some animal which they regard as a sort of good
genius, which takes an interest in their welfare—something like the
North-American Indian totem No man or woman will kill her *ngaitye*,
*except it happens to be an animal which is good for food, when they
have no objection to eating them*. <span id="fr_399"></span>[4](#fn_399.md)
Nevertheless, they will be very careful to destroy the remains," from
the usual fear of sorcery. <span id="fr_400"></span>[5](#fn_400.md) Here we
have the rationale of the totem. "It appears to me," writes the last
witness, "that the *ngaitye* of the Narrinyeri is the same as the *aitu*
of the Samoans, but it is not regarded with so much veneration by the
former as by the latter. The names are evidently derived from one
original, *ngaitye* being the same word as *aitu*, only with the
addition of consonants." <span id="fr_401"></span>[6](#fn_401.md)

Now, the *aitu* of Samoa is simply the primary form of the Gods. "At his
birth a Samoan was supposed to be taken under the care of some God, or
*aitu*, as it was called. The help of several of these Gods was probably
(sic) invoked in succession on the occasion, and the one who happened to
be addressed just as the child was born was fixed on as the child's God
for life." <span id="fr_402"></span>[7](#fn_402.md) Each God was supposed
to appear in "some visible incarnation"—beast, fish, bird, animal,
shell-fish, or creeping thing. "A man would eat freely of what was
regarded as the incarnation of the God of another man, but the
incarnation of his own particular God he would consider it death to
injure or eat." "This class of genii, or tutelary deities, they call
*aitu fale*, or Gods of the house."

In fine, the family-name or tribe-name, plant or animal or what not,
first becomes an ancestor, who re-incarnates himself, and as

<span id="page_104">p. 104</span>

such is not normally to be eaten. This is the rule in the vast majority
of cases. <span id="fr_403"></span>[1](#fn_403.md) But among the
ill-supplied Australians <span id="fr_404"></span>[2](#fn_404.md) he may be
eaten when he is eatable, being regarded all the while as a
God-ancestor, <span id="fr_405"></span>[3](#fn_405.md) whose remains must
be safeguarded from sorcery; while among the well-supplied Samoans he is
strictly taboo, though any man may eat another man's ancestor-God. In
neither case is there any sign of the idea of a totem-sacrament; and
Livingstone's Bechuana tribes, like the Samoans, never ate their totem,
"using the term *ila*, hate or dread, in reference to killing it." And
it is difficult to conceive that a sacramental eating of the totem was
originally a matter of course. To say nothing of the normal veto on the
eating of one's own kin, the people whose totem was the sand, or the
thunder, or the evening star, or the moon, or the hot wind, for
instance, must have been hard put to it to conform to the principle; and
while those of the centipede might contrive to accept it, the folk of
the lion-totem must have found their sacrament precarious. While, again,
in virtue of the primeval logic which regarded interfusion of blood as a
creation of kinship, and the eating of lion as a way of becoming brave,
the belief in the totemic descent, once set up, *might* at times lead to
the practice of eating the totem, the eating of a lamb sacrament, on the
other hand, is not plausibly to be so accounted for. There is, however,
no difficulty in understanding how the totem animal might come to be at
once revered and shunned, or regarded as "unlucky" when met. For
instance, a Basuto of the crocodile totem, who did not often see
crocodiles, might naturally feel when he met one as "civilised" people
have been known to feel when they see an ancestor in a dream—he might
take the meeting, that is, as a warning that trouble or death was about
to overtake him. On the totem name had followed inevitably the belief in
the totem ancestry, and occasionally the prohibition of the totem animal
as food; and to both concepts attached all the hallucinations that early
clustered around names.

When, however, we come to deal with religions as distinguished from
religion, we are at a stage far removed from simple totemism, though
many of the early hallucinations still remain in possession,

<span id="page_105">p. 105</span>

as in the animal-Gods of Egypt and the animal-angels of Judaism. For our
purpose of comparison and comprehension, then, we may fitly take up the
conception of the slain Saviour-God as it existed, on the one hand, in
the ancient cults amid which Christianity arose, and as it has been
found, on the other hand, elsewhere and in later times in cults of
primitive cast.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_377"></span>[99:1](pch28.htm#fr_377.md) Cp. S. Reinach,
*Cultes, Mythes, et Religions*, i (1908) introd. and *passim*; and
*Orpheus*, introd.; Durkheim, *Sur le totemisme*, in *L’Année
Sociologique*, 5e Année, 1902, pp. 114, 117; F. B. Jevons. *Introd. to
Hist. of Relig.* 1996, p. 154. A clear case of totem-sacrament was said
to be lacking till the discovery of that of the Aruntas, discussed by M.
Durkheim, and by Dr. Frazer in the preface to the second edition of his
*Golden Bough*. But a case of the same order, apparently, is noted by J.
G. Müller from the testimony of a traveller among the Native Americans
in Arkansas. *Geschichte der Amerikanischen Urreligionen*, 2te Aufl.,
pp. 277, note.

<span id="fn_378"></span>[99:2](pch28.htm#fr_378.md) Cp. Frazer, *Golden
Bough*, 2nd ed. vol. iii. ch. iii. §§ 15, 16.

<span id="fn_379"></span>[99:3](pch28.htm#fr_379.md) It should be noted
that the whole theory of the totemistic origin of agriculture,
animal-culture, metallurgy, etc. originated by Dr. Jevons and
confidently developed by M. Reinach, is rejected by Dr. Frazer in his
recent monumental work on *Totemism and Exogamy* (4 vols. 1910). In
point of fact, totems are not found to coincide with the special
pursuits of totem-tribes. Work cited, iv, 19.

<span id="fn_380"></span>[100:1](pch28.htm#fr_380.md) Dr. Jevons appears to
argue (pp. 115-117) that the first agriculturists were so only in virtue
of having made totems of the cereals they cultivated. He explicitly
suggests that the agricultural comes later than the pastoral stage
"*because* animal preceded plant totems." On this view men of the bear
or wolf or eagle totem could have neither crops nor herds. The
interesting argument of M. Reinach (as cited above), a development of
that of Dr. Jevons, raises the same set of difficulties.

<span id="fn_381"></span>[100:2](pch28.htm#fr_381.md) See above, [p.
53](pch16.htm#page_53.md).

<span id="fn_382"></span>[100:3](pch28.htm#fr_382.md) In his Social Origins
(1903) Mr. Andrew Lang quite independently advanced a theory of the
totem which is broadly in accord with the following, put forth by me in
the same year. He, however, inferred the process of naming to have begun
in "sobriquets given by group to group," showing that such ostensible
sobriquets occur in France, England, and elsewhere, to this day. (Cp.
his *Secret of the Totem*, 1905, p. 126 *sq*.) But, admitting his
contention that a group has "far more need of names for its neighbours
than of a name for itself," I still submit that a group needed a name
for itself, were it only to answer the question of a stranger or new
neighbour, "who are you?" If this be recognised, there need be no
trouble about reconciling the adoption by late groups or clans of
"derisive" nicknames with the thesis that the early group-names were
"rather honour-giving than derisive." Need they have been either?

<span id="fn_383"></span>[100:4](pch28.htm#fr_383.md) Mr. Mathew
(*Eaglehawk and Crow*, 1899, p. 109) notes the very suggestive fact that
Australian communities as wholes are often named from one of their own
verbal negatives, as if the No" of a tribesman to the alien whom he
could not understand gave the latter his ground for naming. Here we have
purely alien naming. In the exogamous classes within the tribes, again,
we have naming by consent, with animal names.

<span id="fn_387"></span>[101:3](pch28.htm#fr_387.md) Kangaroo and emu,
eaglehawk and crow, iguana, oppossum, etc. are among the names of the
Australian "classes."

<span id="fn_388"></span>[101:4](pch28.htm#fr_388.md) This consideration
does not seem to be met by Mr. Lang's "sobriquet" theory.

<span id="fn_392"></span>[102:1](pch28.htm#fr_392.md) The later evolution
of totemism is searchingly studied in Mr. Lang's *Secret of the Totem*.

<span id="fn_393"></span>[102:2](pch28.htm#fr_393.md) Dr. Frazer
(*Totemism*, 1887, p. 95) remarks: "Sir John Lubbock also \[with
Spencer\] thinks that totemism arose from the habit of naming persons
and families after animals; but in dropping the intermediate links of
ancestor-worship and verbal misunderstanding he has stripped the theory
of all that lent it even an air of plausibility" (citing the *Origin of
Civilisation*, p. 260). Those links being duly inserted, the theory, let
us trust, has rather more air of plausibility" than some of Dr. Frazer's
own hypotheses in other fields. His own final theory of the totem
(*Totemism and Exogamy*, 1910, iv, 57 *sq*.) is quite unsatisfactory.

<span id="fn_394"></span>[102:3](pch28.htm#fr_394.md) So Dr. Jevons,
*Introd. to Hist. of Relig.* pp. 101-104. "The fundamental principle of
totemism," he finally asserts (p. 120),"is the alliance of a clan with
an animal species."

<span id="fn_395"></span>[102:4](pch28.htm#fr_395.md) Rev. D. Macdonald,
*Oceania: Linguistic and Anthropological*, 1889, pp. 182-3. The
primitiveness of the Efatese is attested by the fact that "The woman is
the mother of the clan—that is, every child, male or female, belongs to
the family of the mother." *Id*. Totemism," observes Mr. Lang (The
*Secret of the Totem*, 1905, p. 142), "certainly arose in an age when,
if descent was reckoned, and if names were inherited, it was on the
spindle side."

pp. 80, 89) in general denies that the aborigines are hunger-pinched,
but does not show much of a case to the contrary. Even in New Zealand,
where, though the natives were at a higher culture-level, there were no
land animals, famines were so often set up by wars that this is
suggested as the origin of their cannibalism. Rev. R. Taylor, *Te Ika a
