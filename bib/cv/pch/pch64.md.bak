#### § 3. Zoroastrianism.

It is thus difficult to formulate precisely the evolution of Mithraism.
If the Gâthas are really the oldest parts of the Avesta, the cult of
Mithra, though older than the Gâthas, was for a time or in one region of
Irân rejected or eclipsed, since in those rituals it does not appear.
Zoroastrianism and Mithraism were certainly not originally one, neither
did one grow out of the other. <span id="fr_1421"></span>[3](#fn_1421.md)
And here arises the question whether Zarathustra (Zoroaster), so closely
associated with the Mithra-cult in the later portions of the Avesta, was
a mythical figure or a real reformer who put a more spiritual or
philosophic teaching in place of the simpler naturalism of the Vedic
period. Mr. L. H. Mills, the learned translator and commentator of the
Gâthas, affirms in his introduction the historic reality <span
id="fr_1422"></span>[4](#fn_1422.md) and religious originality of
Zarathustra, mainly on the ground that whereas in the later Avesta he is
lost in myth, in the Gâthas he figures quite simply as a real
person. <span id="fr_1423"></span>[5](#fn_1423.md)

From the conclusion thus drawn, some of us must respectfully but firmly
dissent. The Gâthas, critically considered, do not warrant it; on the
contrary, the ostensibly earliest so clearly present Zarathustra as
either an ideal or an official figure that Mr. Mills is driven to try to
explain them by the question, "Can there have been a school, or family,
of Zarathustrians, religious poets, similar to the Vedic seers?" <span
id="fr_1424"></span>[6](#fn_1424.md) Equally vital is his suggestion that
"the

<span id="page_287">p. 287</span>

special eminence of the Governor of Ragha as needing no 'Zarathustra'
over him, that is, no imperial chief (Yasna xix, 19), may be attributed
to the successors of Zarathustra." <span
id="fr_1425"></span>[1](#fn_1425.md) The fact is that the Gâthas imply
rather an established sacerdotal or quasi-regal functionary than a
single notable man when they speak of Zarathustra Spitama. <span
id="fr_1426"></span>[2](#fn_1426.md)

Still more unconvincing is the claim made for Zoroastrian doctrine as
something primarily abnormal. Mr. Mills first claims that "nowhere at
their period had there been a human voice, so far as we have any
evidence, which uttered thoughts like these"; but immediately
afterwards, doubtless realising the impossibility of founding a cult all
of a sudden with entirely new ideas, he admits that Zarathustra "was
probably only the last visible link in a far extended chain. His system,
like those of his predecessors and successors, was a growth. His main
conceptions had been surmised, although not spoken before." <span
id="fr_1427"></span>[3](#fn_1427.md) The last clause returns to the
arbitrary. There is positively no ground for seeing in the Gâthas new
ideas by a new man: they have all the air of a gradually evolved ritual.

The abnormal depth which Mr. Mills ascribes to them, finally, appears to
be illusory. He affirms <span id="fr_1428"></span>[4](#fn_1428.md) that
"the mental heaven and hell with which we are now familiar as the only
future states recognised by intelligent people, and thoughts which, in
spite of their familiarity, can never lose their importance, are not
only used and expressed in the Gâthas, but expressed there, so far as we
are aware, *for the first time*." But this claim proceeds on such
expressions as, "for the wicked the worst life; for the holy the best
mental state"; <span id="fr_1429"></span>[5](#fn_1429.md) and to read in
such expressions a negation of places of happiness and of torment is to
misread alike the psychology and the language of primitive life. The
modern who negates a physical heaven and hell, but still affirms a
future-state-of-mind, either evades entirely the fatal problem as to the
details of that state or verbally affirms its non-locality. There is no
reason whatever to suppose that in ancient Asia men either demurred to
the doctrine of places of happiness <span
id="fr_1430"></span>[6](#fn_1430.md) and torment, or sought thus
intelligibly to modify them. "Worst life" and "best state of mind" could
perfectly well connote for early thinkers bodily states and local
habitations.

<span id="page_288">p. 288</span>

We must refuse, then, to let the sympathetic illusions even of scholars
force upon us an otherwise unsupported belief in the occurrence of a
remarkable personality which of its own sheer moral power wrought a
sudden and signal innovation in that most conservative of processes;
ancient sacerdotal religion. The religious dualism ascribed to
Zarathustra is in all likelihood a natural adaptation by priests of a
polytheistic process of thought; <span id="fr_1431"></span>[1](#fn_1431.md)
and it seems far more likely that Zarathustra is an ancient title for a
kind of priest-king <span id="fr_1432"></span>[2](#fn_1432.md)—since both
functions appear to go with the name in the early Gâthas—than that there
was a man so named who invented monotheistic dualism, <span
id="fr_1433"></span>[3](#fn_1433.md) even as Abraham is fabled to have
discovered monotheism, and somehow succeeded in imposing his doctrine as
a system of ritual and worship on his contemporaries. As Mr. Mills and
Haug admit, there is not a single biographical detail on Zarathustra to
be found.

Mr. Mills (p. 141) finds proof that the Zarathustrians had early been

Jewish history and Greek and Roman sacrificial usages with the historic
developments in Egypt (Maspero, *Hist. ancienne des peuples de

the Parsis*, 3rd ed. pp. 300-5) credits him with holding at once by
Monotheism and Dualism—one God containing two "principles." This
conception might as well be credited to the Vedas. See next section; and
cp. Cox, *Mythology of the Aryan Nations*, p. 562, and Bréal and Maury
as there cited.
