#### § 12. Absorption in Christianity.

Now, however, arises the great question, How came such a cultus to die
out of the Roman and Byzantine empire after making its way so far and
holding its ground so long? The answer to that question has never, I
think, been fully given, and is for the most part utterly evaded, though
part of it has been suggested often enough. The truth is, as aforesaid,
that Mithraism was not overthrown; it was merely transformed.

It had gone too far to be overthrown: the question was whether it should
continue to rival Christianity or be absorbed by it. While Julian lived,
Mithraism had every prospect of increased vogue and prestige; for the
Emperor expressly adopted it as his own cultus. "To thee," he makes
Hermes say to him, "I have given to know Mithras, thy Father. Be it
thine to follow his precepts, so that he may be unto thee, all thy life
long, an assured harbour and refuge; and, when thou must needs go hence,
full of good hope, thou mayest take this God as a propitious
guide." <span id="fr_1707"></span>[3](#fn_1707.md) It is the very tone and
spirit of the cult of the Christ; and as we have seen, the Christian
Fathers with almost one consent saw in Mithraism the great rival of
their own worship. The spirit of exclusiveness which Christianity had
inherited from Judaism—a spirit alien to the older paganism but

<span id="page_328">p. 328</span>

essential to the building up of an organised and revenue-raising
hierarchy in the later Roman empire—made a struggle between the cults
inevitable.

The critical moment in the career alike of Mithraism and of Christianity
was the death of Julian, who, though biassed in favour of all the older
Gods, gave a special adherence to the War-God Mithra. Had Julian
triumphed in the East and reigned thirty years, matters might have gone
a good deal differently with Christianity. His death, however, was
peculiarly disastrous to Mithra-ism; for he fell at the hands of the
Persian foe, the most formidable enemy of the later empire; and Mithra
was "the Persian" *par excellence*, and the very God of the Persian
host. There can be little doubt that Jovian's instant choice of
Christianity as his State creed was in large measure due to this
circumstance; and that at such a juncture the soldiery would be disposed
to acquiesce, seeking a better omen. Yet, even apart from this, we are
not entitled to suppose that Mithraism could ever have become the
general faith, save by very systematic and prolonged action on the part
of the State, to the end of assimilating its organisation with that of
the Church.

Religions, we say, like organisms and opinions, struggle for survival,
and the fittest survive. That is to say, those survive which are fittest
for the environment—not fittest from the point of view of another and
higher environment. What then was the religion best adapted to the
populations of the decaying Roman Empire, in which ignorance and mean
subjection were slowly corroding alike intelligence and character,
leaving the civilised provinces unable to hold their ground against the
barbarians? An unwarlike population, for one . thing, wants a
sympathetic and emotional religion; and here, though Mithraism had many
attractions, Christianity had more, having sedulously copied every one
of its rivals, and developed special features of its own. The beautiful
and immortal youth of the older sun-worships, Apollo, Mithras, Dionysos,
was always soluble into a mysterious abstraction a in the Christian
legend the God was humanised in the most literal way; and for the
multitude the concrete deity must needs replace the abstract. The
gospels gave a literal story: the Divine Man was a carpenter, and ate
and drank with the poorest of the poor. So with the miracles. The
priesthoods of the older religions often, if not always, explained to
the initiated in the mysteries the mystical purport which was symbolised
by the concrete myths; and in some early Christian writers, as notably
Origen, we find a constant attempt so to explain away concrete miracle
and other stories as allegories.

<span id="page_329">p. 329</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> But gradually the
very idea of allegory died out of the Christian intelligence; and
priests as well as people came to take everything literally and
concretely, till miracles became everyday occurrences. This was the
religion for the Dark Ages, for the new northern peoples which had not
gone through the Pagan evolution of cults and symbolisms and mysticisms,
but whose own traditional faith was too vague and primitive to hold its
ground against the elaborate Christian theology and ritual.

We may say indeed that the preference for such a God as Jesus over such
a one as Mithra was in full keeping with the evolution of æsthetic taste
in the Christian period. Some may to-day even find it hard to conceive
how the Invincible God of the Sun could ever call forth the love and
devotion given to the suffering Christ. As we have seen, Mithra too was
a suffering God, slain and rising again, victorious over death; so that
to him went out in due season all the passion of the weeping worship of
Adonis; but it is in his supernal and glorious aspect that the monuments
persistently present him; and for the decaying ancient world it was
still possible to take some joy in the vision of beauty and strength.
Many there must still have been who wondered, not at the adoration given
to the mystically figured Persian, beautiful as Apollo, triumphant as
Arês, but at the giving of any similar devotion to the gibbeted Jew, in
whose legend figured tax-gatherers and lepers, epileptics and men blind
from birth, domestic traitors and cowardly disciples. Ethical teaching
there was in Mithraism; and for the Mithraists it would be none the less
moving as coming from an eternal conqueror, the type of dominion. But
even as the best Mithraic monuments themselves tell of the decline of
the great art of Greece, so the art of Christism tells of a hastening
dissolution in which æsthetic sense and craftsmanship alike sink to the
levels of barbarism. In the spheres alike of Byzantium and of papal
Rome, the sculptured Mithra would yearly meet fewer eyes that looked
lovingly on grace and delightedly on beauty; more and more eyes that
recoiled pessimistically from comeliness and turned vacantly from
allegorical or esoteric symbols.

The more we study the survival of Christianity, the more clearly do we
see that, in spite of the stress of ecclesiastical strife over
metaphysical dogmas, the hold of the creed over the people was a matter
of concrete and narrative appeal to every-day intelligence. Byzantines
and barbarians alike were held by literalism, not by the unintelligible:
for both alike the symbol had to become a fetish; and for the Dark Ages
the symbol of the cross was much

<span id="page_330">p. 330</span>

more plausibly appealing than that of the God slaying the zodiacal bull.
Other substitutions followed the same law of psychological economy. Thus
it was that Christianity turned the mystic rock, *Petra*, first into the
Christ, <span id="fr_1708"></span>[1](#fn_1708.md) but later into the chief
disciple *Petros;* made an actual tunic of the mystic seamless robe of
the Osirian and Mazdean mysteries, the symbol of light and sky; caused
to be performed at a wedding-feast, for the convenience of the harder
drinkers among the guests, the Dionysiak miracle of turning water into
wine; made Jesus walk on the water not merely in poetry and symbol, as
did Poseidon, but for the utilitarian purpose of trying Peter's faith
and saving him; and put the scourge of Osiris in the Lord's hand for the
castigation of those who defiled the temple by unspiritual
traffic. <span id="fr_1709"></span>[2](#fn_1709.md) There can be little
question as to which plane of doctrine was the more popular. The
Christian tales, in a different moral climate, represent exactly the
commonplace impulse which built up the bulk of Greek mythology by way of
narratives that reduced to an anecdotal basis mystic sculptures and
mysterious rites.

But that was not all. The fatal weakness of Mithraism, as pitted against
Christianity, was that its very organisation was esoteric. For, though
an esoteric grade is a useful attraction, and was so employed by the
Church, a wholly esoteric institution can never take hold of the
ignorant masses. Mithraism was always a sort of freemasonry, <span
id="fr_1710"></span>[3](#fn_1710.md) never a public organisation. <span
id="fr_1711"></span>[4](#fn_1711.md) What the Christians did was to start,
like Rome herself, from a republican basis, combining the life-elements
of the self-supporting religious associations of the Greeks with the
connecting organisation of the Jewish synagogues, <span
id="fr_1712"></span>[5](#fn_1712.md) and then to proceed to build up a
great organisation on the model of that of republican and imperial
Rome—an organisation so august for an era of twilight that the very
tradition of it could serve the later world to live by for a thousand
years. The Christian Church renewed the spell of imperial Rome, and
brought actual force to make good intellectual weakness. And so we read
that the Mithraic worship was by Christian physical force suppressed in
Rome and Alexandria, in the year 376 or 377, <span
id="fr_1713"></span>[6](#fn_1713.md) at a time when, as the inscriptions
show, it was making much headway. <span
id="fr_1714"></span>[7](#fn_1714.md)

<span id="page_331">p. 331</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> At Rome, the deed
was done by the order of the Christian prefect Gracchus; but the
proceeding was specifically one of ecclesiastical malice, since even so
pious an emperor as Gratian dared not yet decree a direct assault upon
an esteemed pagan cult. But, once begun, the movement of destruction
spread, and the Church which still makes capital of the persecution it
suffered at pagan hands, outwardly annihilated the rival it could not
spiritually defeat. In an old Armenian history of the reign of
Tiridates, <span id="fr_1715"></span>[1](#fn_1715.md) it is told how St.
Gregory destroyed in the town of Pakaiaridj the temple of Mihr "called
the son of Aramazd," took its treasure "for the poor," and consecrated
the ground to the Church.

But such acts of piratical violence, which had been made easy by the
earlier check to Mithraism in its special field, the army, only obscured
the actual capitulation made by the Church to the Mithraic as to the
other cults which it absorbed. Even the usages which it could not
conveniently absorb, and therefore repudiated, prevailed within its own
fold for centuries, so that in the eighth century we find Church
Councils commanding proselytes no more to pay worship to fanes and
rocks. <span id="fr_1716"></span>[2](#fn_1716.md) And there were other
survivals. <span id="fr_1717"></span>[3](#fn_1717.md) But all that was a
trifle as compared with the actual survival of Mithraic symbols and
rites in the very worship of Christ. As to the sacrifice of the lamb we
have seen; and though at the end of the seventh century a general
Council ventured to resist the general usage of picturing Christ as a
lamb, <span id="fr_1718"></span>[4](#fn_1718.md) the veto was useless; the
symbol survived. Some Mithraic items went, but more remained. The
Christian bishop went through a ceremony of espousing the Church,
following the old mystery in which occurred the formula, "Hail to thee,
new spouse; hail, new light." <span id="fr_1719"></span>[5](#fn_1719.md)
His mitre was called a crown, or tiara, which answered to the headdress
of Mithra and the Mithraic priests, as to those of the priests of Egypt;
he wore red military boots, now said to be "emblematical of that
spiritual warfare on which he had entered," in reality borrowed from the
military worship of Mithra, perhaps as early as Jovian. And the higher
mysteries of communion, divine sacrifice, and resurrection, as we have
seen, were as much Mithraic as Christist, so that a Mithraist could turn
to the Christian worship and find his main rites unimpaired, lightened
only of the burden of initiative austerities, stripped of the old
obscure mysticism, and with all things turned to the

<span id="page_332">p. 332</span>

literal and the concrete, in sympathy with the waning of knowledge and
philosophy throughout the world. The Mithraic Christians actually
continued to celebrate Christmas Day as the birthday of the sun, despite
the censures of the Pope; <span id="fr_1720"></span>[1](#fn_1720.md) and
their Sunday had been adopted by the supplanting faith. When they
listened to the Roman litany of the holy name of Jesus, they knew they
were listening to the very epithets of the Sun-God—God of the skies,
purity of the eternal light, king of glory, sun of justice, strong God,
father of the ages to come, angel of great counsel. In the epistles of
Paul they found Christian didactics tuned to the very key of their
mystical militarism. Their priests had been wont to say that "he of the
cap" was "himself a Christian." <span id="fr_1721"></span>[2](#fn_1721.md)
They knew that "the Good Shepherd" was a name of Apollo; <span
id="fr_1722"></span>[3](#fn_1722.md) that Mithra, like Hermes and Jesus,
carried the lamb <span id="fr_1723"></span>[4](#fn_1723.md) on his
shoulders; that both were mediators, both creators, both judges of the
dead. Like some of their sacred caves, and so many pagan temples, the
Christian churches looked toward the east. Their soli-lunar midnight
worship was preserved in midnight services, which carried on the purpose
of the midnight meetings of the early Christians, who had simply
followed Essenian, Egyptian, Asiatic, and Mithraic usage; there being no
basis for the orthodox notion that these secret meetings were due to
fear of persecution. <span id="fr_1724"></span>[5](#fn_1724.md) Their
*myazd* or *mizd*, or sacred cake, was preserved in the *mass*, which
possibly copied the very name. <span id="fr_1725"></span>[6](#fn_1725.md)

Above all, their mystic Rock, Petra, was presented to them in the
concrete as the rock Peter, the foundation of the Church. It has been
elsewhere shown <span id="fr_1726"></span>[7](#fn_1726.md) that the myth of
the traitorous Peter connects with those of Proteus and Janus as well as
with that of

<span id="page_333">p. 333</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Mithra, inasmuch
as Janus also had "two faces," led the twelve months as Mithra presided
over the zodiacal signs and Peter over the twelve apostles, and, like
Proteus and Peter and the Time-God in the Mithraic cult, bore the
heavenly keys. Here again the mythic development of Peter probably
follows on that of Jesus; at all events Jesus too has constructively
several of the attributes of Proteus-Janus: as "I am the door"; <span
id="fr_1727"></span>[1](#fn_1727.md) "I stand at the door and knock"; "I am
in the Father and the Father in me" (=Janus with the two faces, old and
young, seated in the midst of the twelve altars); "I have the keys of
death and of Hades." The function of Janus as God of War is also
associable with the dictum, "I came not to bring peace, but a sword."
Finally, the epiphany is in January. But there is to be noted the
further remarkable coincidence that in the Egyptian *Book of the
Dead* <span id="fr_1728"></span>[2](#fn_1728.md) Petra is the name of the
divine doorkeeper of heaven—a circumstance which suggests an ancient
connection between the Egyptian and Asiatic cults. On the other hand,
the early Christian sculptures which represent the story of Jesus and
Peter and the cock-crowing suggest that it originated as an
interpretation of some such sculpture; and the frequent presence of the
cock, as a symbolic bird of the Sun-God, <span
id="fr_1729"></span>[3](#fn_1729.md) in Mithraic monuments, raises again a
presumption of a Mithraic source. There is even some ground for the view
that the legend of St. George is but an adaptation of that of
Mithra; <span id="fr_1730"></span>[4](#fn_1730.md) and it is not unlikely
that St. Michael, who in the Christian east is the bearer of the
heavenly keys, is in this aspect an adaptation from the Persian
War-God. <span id="fr_1731"></span>[5](#fn_1731.md) The dragon-slayer
clearly derives from Babylon.

From the Mithraists too, apparently, came the doctrine of
purgatory, <span id="fr_1732"></span>[6](#fn_1732.md) nowhere set forth in
the New Testament save in the spurious epistle of Peter. <span
id="fr_1733"></span>[7](#fn_1733.md) And though their supreme symbol of
Mithra slaying the bull was perforce set aside, being incapable of
assimilation, they knew that the Virgin Mother was but a variant of the
Goddess-Mothers whose cults had at various times been combined with
those of Mithra, and some of whose very statues served as
Madonnas; <span id="fr_1734"></span>[8](#fn_1734.md) even as the doctrines
of the Logos and the Holy Spirit and the Trinity were borrowed from
their own and older Asiatic cults and those of Egypt alike.

<span id="page_334">p. 334</span>

It has chanced, indeed, that those Christian sects which most fully
adopted the theosophies of Paganism have disappeared under the
controlling power of the main organisation, which, as we have said, held
by a necessity of its existence to a concrete and literal system, and
for the same reason to a rigidly fixed set of dogmas. We know that the
Gnostics adopted Mithra, making his name into a mystic charm, from which
(spelling it Μειθρας) they got the number 365, as from the mystic name
Abraxas. <span id="fr_1735"></span>[1](#fn_1735.md) Manichæism, too, the
greatest and most tenacious of all the Christian schisms, carried on its
ascetic front the stamp of the Persian environment in which it arose,
and visibly stands for a blending of the ascetic and mystic elements of
Mithraism and Christianity. For the celebration of the slain Christ it
practically substituted that of the slain Manes, at the paschal season;
reducing the crucifixion to a mere allegory of the cult of vegetation,
and identifying the power and wisdom of the Saviour-God with the Sun and
Moon. <span id="fr_1736"></span>[2](#fn_1736.md) Neither its adherents nor
its opponents avowed that it was thus a fresh variant of Mithraism; but
the Mithraists cannot have failed to see and signalise alike the
heretical and the orthodox adaptation, and it is clear that Mithraism
not only entered into Manichæism but prepared the way for it in the
West. <span id="fr_1737"></span>[3](#fn_1737.md) The more reason why
Mithras should be tabooed by the organised Church. Thus, then, we can
understand why the very name seemed at length to be blotted out. And
yet, despite all forcible suppression, not only do the monuments of the
faith endure to tell how for centuries it distanced its rival; not only
do its rites and ceremonies survive as part of the very kernel of the
Christian worship; but its record remains unknowingly graven in the
legend on the dome of the great Christian temple of Rome, destined to
teach to later times a lesson of human history, and of the unity of
human religion, more enduring than the sectarian faith that is
proclaimed within.
