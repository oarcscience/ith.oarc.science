<p>To point to these Mithraic monuments, of which there are so many examples, is to point out, further, that the old Persian aversion to images of deity had disappeared with the extension of the Mithraic cultus.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1495"></A><A HREF="#fn_1495"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> There is no doubt as to the original forbiddal of images, despite the common delusion that the Jews were the first to lay down such a veto. But it was inevitable that, in the artistic countries,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1496"></A><A HREF="#fn_1496"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> the adoption of Mithraism should involve the representing Mithra by images, like other deities. Nor was this all. One reason for regarding the Zend-Avesta as substantially ancient is the comparative simplicity of the Mithra cultus it sets forth. Just as happened with Christianity later, the spreading faith assimilated all manner of ancient symbolisms, and new complications of ritual; and Mithra is associated with the strange symbolic figures of the lion-headed serpentine God, bearing two keys, but above all is presented in that of the slayer of the bull. Whence came that conception? There are many explanations. It has been variously decided that the bull slain by Mithra is the symbol of the earth, the symbol of the moon, the symbol of the sun, the symbol of lust, the symbol of evil, the symbol of the cloud, the bull of the Zodiac, and the cosmogonic bull of the Magian system.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1497"></A><A HREF="#fn_1497"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> All of these conceptions</p>

<p>may be held to connect with the symbolism of the Veda, where Agni is the bull; and it is in a similarly early sense, as the Sun-God among the cows, that Mithra is in the Avesta the bull and the cow-stealer&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1498"></A><A HREF="#fn_1498"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>&#151;which last name he retains in the late Roman period,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1499"></A><A HREF="#fn_1499"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> when he has the epithet in common with Hermes. On the basis of the primitive nature-myth arose a host of imageries, all interfluent and inseparable, because all fanciful. Any one who has followed the maze of symbolism in Plutarch's <i>Isis and Osiris</i> will be prepared to believe that for the later ancients Mithra as the bull had half-a-dozen significations.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1500"></A><A HREF="#fn_1500"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> In that famous treatise, Isis and Osiris and Typhon successively represent a number of different Nature-forces&#151;sun, moon, moisture, the Nile, the Earth, generative warmth, injurious heat, and so on&#151;shifting and exchanging their places, till it becomes plain that the old theosophy was but a ceaseless flux of more or less congruous fancies. We may be sure that Mithraism was as hospitable to mystic meanings as Osirianism. It is intelligible and probable that Mithra slaying the bull should have meant for many the rays of the sun penetrating the earth, and so creating life for mundane creatures,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1501"></A><A HREF="#fn_1501"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> as the dog feeds on the blood&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1502"></A><A HREF="#fn_1502"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> of the slain bull. In the Vendid&acirc;d, the older (Vedic) God Yima, whose "glory" was secured by Mithra when Yima fell through disobedience,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1503"></A><A HREF="#fn_1503"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> is represented as "sealing the earth with his golden seal," and thrusting into it with his dagger,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1504"></A><A HREF="#fn_1504"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A> which is perhaps the earliest form of the myth under notice.</p>  
<p>But those who adopt this as the whole explanation&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1505"></A><A HREF="#fn_1505"><FONT SIZE="1">8</FONT></A> overlook a principle perhaps bound up with the origin of Mithraism proper&#151;the significance of the bull as one of those signs of the zodiac through which the sun passed in his annual course. It is nearly certain that the zodiac was the source of very much of the later symbolism and mysticism of those ancient cults which their priesthoods associated</p>

<p>with the sun, not to speak of those whose priesthoods professedly repudiated sun-worship. And one of the most important facts established by the collection and comparison of ancient monuments&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1506"></A><A HREF="#fn_1506"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> is, that the Mithraic cultus connects symbolically with an Assyrian or Akkadian cultus far older&#151;the cult which produced those common Assyrian monuments in which a divine or kingly personage slays a lion or a bull, thrusting a sword through him.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1507"></A><A HREF="#fn_1507"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> There can be little doubt that these successive religious representations of the slaying of the lion and the slaying of the bull rest partly on a zodiacal system of sacred symbolism, in which the slaying of a given animal means either the passing of the sun into or out of a particular sign of the zodiac at a particular season of the year, or the slaying of the animal represented as a special sacrifice, or both.</p>  
<p>The zodiac, which is of immense antiquity,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1508"></A><A HREF="#fn_1508"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> has come to be conventionalised&#151;that is to say, it is fixed, so that the signs have long ceased to coincide with the actual constellations whose names they bear. But originally the students of the stars must needs have had regard to the actual constellations. And this carries us very far back indeed. The view that the slaying of the bull originally pointed to the sun's entering the sign of the Bull at either the vernal equinox or the winter solstice&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1509"></A><A HREF="#fn_1509"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> is supported by the circumstance that the bull was at once a symbol of the Sun-God and a symbol of agriculture, the early plough being drawn by bulls or oxen (whence possibly the naming of the constellation);&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1510"></A><A HREF="#fn_1510"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> and is</p>

<p>strongly suggested further by the hostile function assigned in the monuments to the Scorpion, which is the opposing sign, and would represent the autumnal equinox.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1511"></A><A HREF="#fn_1511"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> This symbol then dates back, probably, more than 3,000 years before the Christian era&#151;6,000 years if we assume the original zodiacal year to have begun at the winter solstice; while the symbol of the slaying of the lion would signify the sun's entrance into Leo at midsummer in the same periods, and may connect with the worship of Tammuz, after whom the midsummer month was named in Syria&#151;unless the God took his name from the month. In point of fact, astronomy tells us that, by the precession of the equinoxes, the constellation of the Bull had ceased to be the sun's place at the vernal equinox for about 2,100 years before the reign of Augustus, the constellation of the Ram taking its place. Still, just as the symbol of the slaying of the lion had, on this theory, held its ground in religion after the bull played a similar part, so did the sign of the Bull play its part in symbol and ceremony long after the sun had begun to enter the constellation Aries at the sacred season. Nevertheless&#151;and this seems a crowning vindication of the zodiacal theory&#151;while the bull holds its place on the monuments of the Christian era, we find at this very period, in connection with the worship of Mithra as with those of Dionysos&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1512"></A><A HREF="#fn_1512"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> and (more anciently) of Amun,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1513"></A><A HREF="#fn_1513"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> an actual ceremony of slaying a ram in honour of the Sun-God. In Persia, the sign Aries, the Ram, was known as the Lamb;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1514"></A><A HREF="#fn_1514"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> and in some of the Mithraic mysteries at the Christian era, it was a lamb that was slain.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1515"></A><A HREF="#fn_1515"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> That fact, as we shall see, has further bearings; but thus far it surely counts for much as a proof of the zodiacal element in the symbolism of the ancient sophisticated sun worships. The notion of a Fish God is deeply rooted in several of the older eastern religions,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1516"></A><A HREF="#fn_1516"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> and though it may be explained as arising from the fancy that the sun was a fish, who plunged into the sea in the evening and emerged in the morning&#151;a natural type of immortality for later mystics&#151;it also strongly suggests an ancient connection with zodiacal astrolatry.</p>

<p><a name="page_302"><font size="1" color="green">p. 302</font></A></p>  
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> In any case, there is no more plausible explanation than the zodiacal one of the early Christian habit of calling Jesus Christ the Fish. The sign of the Fishes comes next the Ram in the zodiac; and that constellation had actually taken the place of the Ram, at the spring equinox, when this symbol came into use.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1517"></A><A HREF="#fn_1517"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A></p>  
<p>We may further infer, when we read of Phrixos, the son of Athamas, who was carried to Colchis by a ram with a golden fleece,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1518"></A><A HREF="#fn_1518"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> and who in his statue on the Acropolis was represented as having "just sacrificed the ram to some God,"&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1519"></A><A HREF="#fn_1519"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> that in some eastern cult&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1520"></A><A HREF="#fn_1520"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> which the Greeks misunderstood, a deity was latterly figured as borne on the zodiacal Ram, in the manner of Mithras "bull-borne,"&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1521"></A><A HREF="#fn_1521"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> and as sacrificing the ram in its turn. And that there was a constant astronomical significance in the Mithraic cult in particular, we know from the testimony of Origen, to the effect that its mysteries included an elaborate representation of the movements and relations of the stars and the planets, and the movements of the disembodied human soul among these.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1522"></A><A HREF="#fn_1522"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A></p>  
<p>Every widespread religion, however, is necessarily a complex of many ideas, and in the cult of Mithra this is abundantly seen. In the course of its western evolution it became closely associated, like that of Attis, with the popular worship of Cybel&ecirc;, the Magna Mater, Mother of the Gods;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1523"></A><A HREF="#fn_1523"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A> and in virtue of Roman military tradition it was bracketed with that of many specifically Roman deities. In the Mithraic cave-temples have been found images and names of Juno, Minerva, Apollo, Mars, Bacchus, Mercury, and Venus, "and especially Silvanus, who had taken on the character of a pantheistic God, doubtless because he was the Latin equivalent of the Greek Pan."' This, by the way, is not the sole reason for approximating Mithra to Pan."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1524"></A><A HREF="#fn_1524"><FONT SIZE="1">8</FONT></A> A collocation of the Sun-God with the Goat-God occurs constantly in Greek mythology, and can be clearly traced back to the Babylonian system, on which Mithraism had independently drawn.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1525"></A><A HREF="#fn_1525"><FONT SIZE="1">9</FONT></A> The image of the slaying of the bull, in particular, whatever its original bearing, came to be associated</p>

<p>specially with the idea of sacrifice and purification; and the great vogue of the Phrygian institutions of the Taurobolium and Criobolium,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1526"></A><A HREF="#fn_1526"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> or purification by the blood of bulls and rams, must have reacted on Mithraism, even if it were not of strictly Mithraic origin. Mithra, like Osiris&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1527"></A><A HREF="#fn_1527"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> and Dionysos,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1528"></A><A HREF="#fn_1528"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> we saw,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1529"></A><A HREF="#fn_1529"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> was the bull as well as the God to whom the bull was sacrificed, even as Amun, to whom rams were sacrificed, was "the great ram";&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1530"></A><A HREF="#fn_1530"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> and herein lies one of the germs of the dogma of the death and resurrection of the God; another being the ancient astronomic myth, to which we shall come later, of the Descent of the God to Hades. In the procedure of the Taurobolia and Criobolia, which grew very popular in the Roman world,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1531"></A><A HREF="#fn_1531"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> we have the literal and original meaning of the phrase "washed in the blood of the lamb"; the doctrine being that resurrection and eternal life were secured by drenching or sprinkling with the actual blood of a sacrificial bull or ram, often doubtless a lamb, that being a common sacrifice from time immemorial, on the ground that for certain purposes the victim must be sexually pure. Thus we have such mortuary inscriptions as <i>Taurobolio criobolioque in aeternum renatus</i>, "By the bull-sacrifice and the ram-sacrifice born again for eternity."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1532"></A><A HREF="#fn_1532"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A> But inasmuch as there was a constant tendency in the mystical systems to substitute symbolism for concrete usages, the Mithraists may be surmised to have ultimately performed their sacrificial rites in a less crude form than that described by Prudentius.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1533"></A><A HREF="#fn_1533"><FONT SIZE="1">8</FONT></A></p>

For that matter, however, the "idolatry" of antiquity in general is on all fours with the reverence of images under Christianity.</P>

Darmesteter holds that the <a name="page_299"><font size="1" color="green">p. 299</font></A> bull, like the Vedic cow, = the cloud; that its seed is the rain (p. 149); and that its true slayer is the serpent (p. 153). In the zodiac, the bull was <i>domus Veneris</i>. But the idea that the bull or ram symbolised lust could well be primary; and in the Persian myth the ram helps to lead the first man and woman into sin (Spiegel, <i>Er&acirc;n. Alterthumsk.</i>, i, 511-512; <i>Bundahish</i>., xv, 13). For Porphyry, the God (Mithra) who was a stealer of oxen was secretly concerned with generation (<i>De antro</i>, xviii). As to the primeval ox, source of all animals, see the Bundahish, iii, 4-18; iv, 1, etc. (West's <i>Pahlavi Texts</i>, i, 17-20. S.B.E. vol. v).</P>

Professor Cumont, while of course rejecting Lajard's theory that Mithraism originated in the Assyrian system, recognises that the planetary and zodiacal elements in Mithraism were certainly borrowed by it from the ancient Chaldean system; and that in general Chaldean elements were early superimposed upon the Iranian when the cults met at Babylon (<i>Textes et Monuments</i>, i, 73, 109).</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1507"></A><A HREF="pch67.htm#fr_1507">300:2</A> Sometimes in the Persian period a griffin or dragon (pronounced by Justi, <i>Gesch. des alten Persiens</i>, p. 109, to be the Arimanian beast) takes the place of the lion or bull. See the figure from Persepolis in <i>Ancient Calendars and Constellations</i>, by the Hon. Emmeline E. Plunkett, 1903, p. 64. Miss Plunkett points out that this figure is a compound of the <i>four</i> zodiacal figures, the Bull, the Lion, the Scorpion, and the Eagle. The bull and the lion, as well as this composite, appear in Persian sculpture of the age of Xerxes, evidently following the Assyrian models. Reber, <i>History of Ancient Art</i>, Eng. tr. 1883, pp. 123-5. Again, there is a presumption that the design of a lion attacking a bull or an ilcorn, seen on a number of ancient coins in Asia Minor, and even in Macedonia, is a symbol analogous to that of Mithra slaying the bull (see Parker and Ainsworth's <i>Lares and Penates</i>, 1853, p. 187, where the explanation given will not stand). Persia is still the "Land of the Lion and the Sun." Cp. the figures on the palace of Xerxes, reproduced by Justi, p. 106.</P>

The careful argument of Letronne (<i>M&eacute;langes d&#146;&eacute;rudition et de critique historique; Origin des Zodiaques</i>) to show that the zodiac originated with the Greeks is exploded by the discoveries of Assyriology. The ideas of Macrobius and of Dupuis and Volney, which Letronne undertook to overthrow, are thus in large measure rehabilitated. See R. Brown. jun., <i>Eridanus: River and Constellation</i>, 1883; <i>The Phainomena of Aratos</i>, 1885; and <i>Primitive Constellations of the Greeks, Ph&#156;nicians, and Babylonians</i>, 1899.

The story being one of child sacrifice by way of averting a drought, it has analogies to the myth of Abraham and Isaac, which is a late sophistication of an earlier legend. See Frazer, <i>G. B.</i> ii, 35, as to the Greek development of the myth.</P>

Here the taurobolium and criobolium are directly connected with Mithraism; and it would appear from Strabo (xv, 3, &sect; 14) that the Mazdeans practised something very like it, slaying victims over pits into which the blood dripped.
