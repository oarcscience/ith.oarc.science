### PART III.

### MITHRAISM

#### § 1. Introductory.

<span class="smallcaps">In</span> the ninth edition of the *Encyclopædia
Britannica*, supervised by so eminent a scholar and hierologist as the
late Professor Robertson Smith, as against some hundreds of pages on the
books of the Bible, there was devoted to the subject of the ancient
Persian deity Mithra or Mithras, and his cultus, one column. All the
while, Mithraism was well known to have been the chief rival to
Christianity in the ancient world. Within the past dozen years there has
taken place a great improvement in the sense of proportion among the
cultivators of hierology; and the study of Mithraism, in particular, has
been conducted with a zeal and a competence which leave little opening
for new contributions. The present survey, first undertaken over twenty
years ago, is an attempt to elucidate, in the light of comparative
science, what is likely to remain an obscure problem.

When all is said, we have but a fragmentary knowledge of Mithraism. But
we do know that it was during some centuries the most widespread of the
religious systems of the Roman empire. That is to say, Mithraism was in
point of range the most nearly universal religion of the western world
in the early centuries of the Christian era. As to this, students are
agreed. <span id="fr_1397"></span>[1](#fn_1397.md) To the early

<span id="page_282">p. 282</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Fathers, we shall
see, Mithraism was a most serious thorn in the flesh; and the monumental
remains of the Roman period, in almost all parts of the empire, show its
extraordinary extension. In our own country, held by the Romans for
three hundred years at a time when Christianity is supposed to have
penetrated the whole imperial world, there have been found no signs
whatever of any Roman profession of the Christian faith; while there are
a number of monuments in honour of Mithra. <span
id="fr_1398"></span>[1](#fn_1398.md) There has been found, for instance, a
Mithraic cave <span id="fr_1399"></span>[2](#fn_1399.md) at Housesteads, in
Northumberland, containing sculptures of Mithra-worship, and an
inscription: "To the God, best and greatest, invincible Mithra, Lord of
Ages"; <span id="fr_1400"></span>[3](#fn_1400.md) and another at Kichester,
with an inscription: "To the God the Sun, the invincible Mithra, the
Lord of Ages." Other monuments have been found at Chester, on the line
of the Roman wall, at Cambeckfort in Cumberland, at Oxford, at
York, <span id="fr_1401"></span>[4](#fn_1401.md) and at London and
Manchester. <span id="fr_1402"></span>[5](#fn_1402.md) And "Mithraic
bas-reliefs, cut upon the smoothed faces of rocks, or upon tablets of
stone, still abound throughout the former western provinces of the Roman
Empire; many exist in Germany: still more in France." <span
id="fr_1403"></span>[6](#fn_1403.md) According to Mr. King, again, "the
famous ‘Arthur’s Oon’ (destroyed in the eighteenth century) upon the
Carron, a hemispherical vaulted building of immense blocks of stone, was
unmistakeably a *Specus Mithræum*, the same in design as Chosroes’
magnificent fire-temple at Gazaca." But in other lands the remains of
Mithraic shrines are far more numerous: they abound in the Alps, in
Southern France, in Eastern Italy, in Dalmatia, in Dacia, in many
Mediterranean ports; and though their distribution is unequal, they
signify that the cult went wherever went the legions and the Syrian
traders who followed them.

And yet, with all this testimony to the vogue of Mithraism in the early
Christian centuries, there ensues for a whole era an

<span id="page_283">p. 283</span>

absolute blank in the knowledge of the matter in Christendom—a  thousand
years in which the ancient cultus seems a forgotten name in Europe. One
modern investigator, M. Lajard, <span id="fr_1404"></span>[1](#fn_1404.md)
thinks that since the time of the Fathers the first in European
literature to mention Mithra was Pietro Riccio (Petrus Crinitus), <span
id="fr_1405"></span>[2](#fn_1405.md) born about 1465, a disciple of
Politian; and no other mention occurs till about the middle of the
sixteenth century. <span id="fr_1406"></span>[3](#fn_1406.md) Such was the
ignorance of most scholars, that of three now well-known Mithraic
monuments discovered about that period, not one is attributed to Mithra
either by the great antiquarian of the time, Rossi, or by his pupil,
Flaminius Vacca. Every one knows the sculptured group of Mithra slaying
the bull, so often engraved, of which we have a good example in the
British Museum. Rossi declared one of these monuments to represent
Jupiter, as the bull, carrying off Europa; and Vacca tells how a
lion-headed image, now known to represent Kronos-Zervan or the
Time-Spirit in the mysteries of Mithra, but then held to represent the
devil, was (probably) burned in a limekiln. <span
id="fr_1407"></span>[4](#fn_1407.md) A century later, Leibnitz demonstrated
that Ormazd and Ahriman, the Good and Evil Powers of the Persian system
to which Mithra belonged, were simply deified heroes; and later still
the historian Mosheim, a man not devoid of judgment, elaborately proved
that Mithra had simply been at one time, like Nimrod, a famous
hunter, <span id="fr_1408"></span>[5](#fn_1408.md) before the Lord or
otherwise. Other eighteenth-century scholars discussed the problem more
intelligently; <span id="fr_1409"></span>[6](#fn_1409.md) but even in our
own day, when all the extant notices and monuments of Mithra have been
carefully collected and studied, vigilant scholars <span
id="fr_1410"></span>[7](#fn_1410.md) confess that we know very little as to
the Mithraic religion. It is somewhat remarkable that this should be so;
and though in the terms of the case we cannot look to find much direct
knowledge, we may hope at least to find out *why* the once popular
cultus has fallen into such obscurity. To that end we must see what
really is known about it.

seems inexact. Cp. Prof. Cumont, *Textes et Monuments*, passim. Prof.
Cumont ascribes the largest share of Mithraic monuments to Germany,
noting that they are abundant also in Italy, and fairly plentiful in
south-eastern Gaul, but rare in central and western France, and very
scanty in Greece.
