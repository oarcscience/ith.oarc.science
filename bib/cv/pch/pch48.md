#### § 3. Derivations of the Christian Logos.

It is significant of the difficulty of winning a hearing for an
important new truth in hierology that, a hundred years after the
elaborate development of the Logos doctrine in Philo Judæus was fully
demonstrated, the fact is no part of ordinary knowledge even among
scholars, if they be not theologians. <span
id="fr_1161"></span>[3](#fn_1161) Bryant, who first among English
writers made the complete demonstration, held that Philo derived his
ideas from association with the Christians. That is obviously a
delusion; <span id="fr_1162"></span>[4](#fn_1162) but there can be no
question about the actuality of the parallel between the Philonic and
the Johannine and other Christian forms of the doctrine; and it may be
that a

<span id="page_224">p. 224</span>

list of Philo's dicta as drawn up by the unsuspecting Bryant <span
id="fr_1163"></span>[1](#fn_1163) will be more acceptable than one of
those compiled by later scholars.

Much discussion has taken place over the question whether Philo really
conceived his Logos as a person <span
id="fr_1165"></span>[1](#fn_1165)—a problem of which the futility may be
realised after asking whether Christians to-day conceive of the Holy
Ghost as a person. That Philo should be inconsistent; that he should
successively make his Logos a deity, a spoken utterance, a creative
power, an instrument, an aspect of the deity, a far-seeing spirit, a
refuge, the first-born son of the deity, a high-priest and mediator, the
covenant, <span id="fr_1166"></span>[2](#fn_1166) the co-ordinating law
of the universe, an eternal entity, the first-created thing, an
angel, <span id="fr_1167"></span>[3](#fn_1167) the sun, <span
id="fr_1168"></span>[4](#fn_1168) the chief of the angels, <span
id="fr_1169"></span>[5](#fn_1169) a body of doctrine, the Scriptures,
Moses <span id="fr_1170"></span>[6](#fn_1170), an abstraction of wisdom,
the soul of the world <span id="fr_1171"></span>[7](#fn_1171)—all this
belonged to his mental habit and that of the students of his age. It was
impossible for such minds to be consistent or even momentarily clear:
all philosophic thought was for them a shapeless cloud of words and
verbal images. But where the born verbalisers fluctuated through a
hundred forms of phrase, simpler minds inevitably reduced abstractions
to personalities *sans phrase*. <span id="fr_1172"></span>[8](#fn_1172)

<span id="page_226">p. 226</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> In the Book of
Enoch the Messiah is identified, apparently long before Philo, with a
First-Created power who has the characteristics of the Logos. <span
id="fr_1173"></span>[1](#fn_1173) For most neologising Jews, in short,
the Logos passed into personal status just as did Vohumano, "the Good
Mind," for the Mazdeans, because the perpetual naming of an abstraction
in religious lore or ritual sets up for the believer an idea of separate
personality or nothing. The personalisers were but doing what their
simpler ancestors had done before when they gave personality to natural
objects, winds, rivers, diseases, thunder, and lightning. They did so
because they could not help it; and Philo, with his superior verbal
resources, psychologises helplessly all the while on the primitive
plane.

It is thus quite misleading to say that in his writings "from first to
last the Logos is the thought of God, dwelling subjectively in the
infinite mind, planted out and made objective in the universe." <span
id="fr_1174"></span>[2](#fn_1174) Supposing such a formula to have real
significance for any one to-day—supposing it to be compatible with a
theistic proposition of personality—it could have no meaning for Philo,
who would not have written as he did if he could so have formulated;
though the triplication of Thought and God and Infinite Mind may be said
to be a good deal in his spirit. What we learn from such a verbal
construction is that if a modern academic cannot propound a Logos-Idea
without self-contradiction, much less could an Alexandrian Jew. And the
historical conclusion remains clear, that the Christian doctrine of the
Logos is simply a deposition in dogmatic form, round the nucleus of a
sacramental cult, of the vaporous haze of thought set up in the Jewish
world by Yahwistic speculation on Gentile notions. <span
id="fr_1175"></span>[3](#fn_1175)

It was the presence of the Jesuist nucleus that wrought the
solidification. For Philo there was no bar to a multiplication of
*Logoi;* and besides making *Logoi* of both Moses and Aaron <span
id="fr_1176"></span>[4](#fn_1176) he has a multitude of lesser *Logoi*
who figure endlessly as thoughts, words, angels, laws, forces, and
reasons. <span id="fr_1177"></span>[5](#fn_1177) His Bible withheld him
from

<span id="page_227">p. 227</span>

deifying the actual priest or emperor; Moses was for him definitely
reduced to human status; and to the prophets he pays remarkably little
attention, merely citing one occasionally as a "companion of
Moses." <span id="fr_1178"></span>[1](#fn_1178) Finally, he appears in
several treatises to be, like the writer of the fifty-first psalm, <span
id="fr_1179"></span>[2](#fn_1179) ethically indifferent to
sacrifice <span id="fr_1180"></span>[3](#fn_1180)—so much so that it
would be difficult to believe that the same hand wholly wrote these and
others in which he accepts a modified form of the principle of
atonement, <span id="fr_1181"></span>[4](#fn_1181) were it not for the
numerous proofs in every treatise that his philosophy is always in a
state of flux. In one passage he adumbrates a combination of the ideas
of the mediatorial Logos and the national Messiah; <span
id="fr_1182"></span>[5](#fn_1182) but a mind so fixed as his on allegory
and symbol and abstraction was unprepared to make a definite Logos out
of a sacrificed demigod, even had he lived to see the new Jesuist
movement. It is the merest truism, therefore, to say that in his lore
the Logos-idea never comes to dogmatic birth. Jesuism precipitated it on
the eucharistic sacrifice, thus excluding further vacillations; but the
idea of the *Sophia*, which, following the book of the *Wisdom of Jesus
ben Sirach*, he also manipulates, <span
id="fr_1183"></span>[6](#fn_1183) and which was no less potentially
adaptable, never came to dogmatic birth at all, save in Gnostic
teachings which the Church was finally able to suppress.

On the other hand, Philo's doctrine of the Holy Spirit <span
id="fr_1184"></span>[7](#fn_1184) (which

<span id="page_228">p. 228</span>

in his theosophy remains as indeterminate as his notion of the *Logos*,
and is much less stressed than either that or the notion of the Sophia,
with both of which it vaguely blends) did find dogmatic acceptance in
the formula of the Christian Trinity. The *Sophia* would have been on
many grounds more suitable, supplying as she would the normal demand for
a Mother-Goddess; and the male Spirit, as a matter of fact, has always
remained an extremely dim conception, availing very little for the
Christian cult. But the formation of a Trinity was forced upon Christism
by many of its theosophic precedents; <span
id="fr_1185"></span>[1](#fn_1185) and the admission of a Goddess was
vetoed by the ascetic principle which was in the ascendant when the
doctrine was formulated: so many and various are the forces which
determine the growth of a syncretic system in a religiously crowded
environment.

Such are the chances of social selection. Had not the ascetic principle
been thus temporarily active, and had not the craving for a secondary
Teaching-God been for the time satisfied by identifying the Sacrificed
God with the Logos, an identification of Mary with both *Sophia* and the
Spirit (originally feminine) would have been an equally natural and an
equally facile proceeding, the preparation having been sufficiently made
on Judaic lines. As it was, the exaltation of Mary, when it came about
afterwards as a result of the stressing of the metaphysical aspects of
the Son, was undertaken too late for the grafting of a dogmatic *Sophia*
on the new sacred books; and the still later attempt at a new gospel in
the thirteenth century was crushed by the preponderating power of the
Papacy. But it is none the less clear that the doctrine of the Logos is
a product of the same process of primitive psychology as produces
deities of any order.

<span id="fn_1162"></span>[223:4](pch48.htm#fr_1162) It may be freely
granted that the writings of Philo are likely to have suffered like
others from the ancient obsession of literary fraud. On this point,
antiquity had hardly evolved any moral sense, much less a moral
standard. But however Philo's writings may have been tampered with, and
with whatever purpose, it was not by Christian hands. The Christian
frauds in the way of Sibylline predictions, etc., betray themselves at a
glance. No Philonic passages have that hall-mark.

<span id="fn_1176"></span>[226:4](pch48.htm#fr_1176) *De leg. alleg.*
iii, 15, 33.

<span id="fn_1177"></span>[226:5](pch48.htm#fr_1177) *De Somniis*, i,
12, 13, 19, 23, 31, 34; *De Sacrificiis*, 13; *De conf. ling.*, 17; *De
Posterit. Caini*, 25-26. Principal Drummond decides that "the Logoi have
nothing personal about them" (ii, 225)—another unwarranted
specification. There is nothing to show that Philo ever asked himself
what he understood by personality. It is essential to an understanding
of him to realise that his philosophy derives from a stage of
speculation more akin to animism than to science.

<span id="fn_1178"></span>[227:1](pch48.htm#fr_1178) *De conf. ling.* c.
14. Cp. *De Inebrietate*, c. 8. Philo's relation to the Scriptures is
certainly not that of the traditional instructed Jew. His reading is in
the main limited to the Pentateuch. Cp. Dr. H. E. Ryle, *Philo and Holy
Scripture*, 1895, pp. xvii, xxxii.

<span id="fn_1179"></span>[227:2](pch48.htm#fr_1179) Ps. li, 16-17. Vv.
18-19 are obviously from another hand.

<span id="fn_1180"></span>[227:3](pch48.htm#fr_1180) *E.g.*, *De Plant.
Noe*, c. 39; *De Mose*, iii, 10; *De Sacrificantibus*, 3, 8; *Quis
haeres rer. div.* 16; *De Leg. ad Caium*, 39. In the last-cited passage
he makes Herod Agrippa wholly ignore the annual sacrifice of atonement,
speaking only of the offering of incense; in the treatise *De
Humanitate* regard is had mainly to the Deuteronomic code, where
atonement is not mentioned; and in the *De Sacrificantibus* and *Quis
Haeres* all sacrifice is as such made light of.

<span id="fn_1181"></span>[227:4](pch48.htm#fr_1181) Thus, in the
treatise *De Victimis*, the ordinary view of sacrifice is taken for the
most part, the citations on that head being solely from Leviticus. Even
there, indeed (c. 14), repentance is expressly set forth as the
condition of salvation, and sacrifice as a mere symbol of repentance. So
also in *De congressu quaer. erud. gratia*, c. 14, sacrifices are
reduced to ideas; even supplication is declared unnecessary; good works
and contrition are all. So also in the *De leg. alleg.* cc. 30, 57, 61.
Cp. *De Abrahamo*, cc. 1, 3, 4, 5; *De Migratione Abr.* cc. 1, 5. Yet in
the *De Abrahamo* (cc. 33-35) the act of child sacrifice is treated as
not unnatural. Again in the *De Confusion Linguarum* (c. 20) the "ransom
and Price for the salvation of the soul" is not sacrifice; and in *De
Sacrificiis* (c. 36) and *Quis haeres rer. divin.* (c. 24) the function
of the Levites as ransomed sacrifices is mystically interpreted.

<span id="fn_1182"></span>[227:5](pch48.htm#fr_1182) *De
Execrationibus*, c. 9.

<span id="fn_1183"></span>[227:6](pch48.htm#fr_1183) *E.g.*, "The
mind......shall leave both its father, the God of the universe, and the
Mother of all things, namely, the Virtue and Wisdom of God" (*De leg.
alleg.* ii, 14). Again the Creator.......is also the Father of his
Creation, and the Mother was the Knowledge of the Creator with whom God
uniting......became the Father of Creation. And this Knowledge having
received the seed of God......brought forth her only and well-beloved
Son......this world" (*De Inebrietate*, c. 8. There follows a quotation
from "some one of the beings of the divine company" which points to
Prov. viii, 32-3, but differs from both the Septuagint and the Hebrew).
Yet again "the abrupt rock \[pierced by Moses\] is the Wisdom of God"
(*De leg. alleg.* ii, 21). And yet again Sophia the daughter of God "is
both male and a Father" (*De Profug.* c. 9. Cp. 20).

<span id="fn_1184"></span>[227:7](pch48.htm#fr_1184) *De Gigantibus*,
cc. 5, 6, 7. Like the other personifications in the Judæo-Christian
creed, this in all its aspects—as Wind, Fire, Dove, Generator, Inspirer,
Uniter—is common to older eastern mythologies. Cp. Gubernatis,
*Mitologia vedica*, p. 142 *sq*.

<span id="fn_1185"></span>[228:1](pch48.htm#fr_1185) It is partly
developed in Philo, *De leg. alleg.* i, 13; *De Sacrificiis*, 14; *Quis
rer. div.* 44, 45; *De Congressu*, 2; *De Abrahamo*, 24. Cp. Reichardt,
as cited, pp. 54-57, concerning other Judaic precedents.
