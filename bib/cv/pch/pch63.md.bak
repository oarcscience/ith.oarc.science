#### § 2. Beginnings of Cult.

To trace completely the history of the cultus, however, we should have
to make an examination note merely of Mithraism proper, but of at least
three older systems. No historical principle

<span id="page_284">p. 284</span>

is better established than this, that all historic religions run into
and derive from some other religions, the creeds of all mankind being
simply phases of a continuous evolution. So, when we say that Mithraism
derives from Persia, we are already implying that it affiliates more
distantly to the religions of India and Mesopotamia. Here it must
suffice, therefore, to give only the briefest sketch of origins.

We trace the cult specifically in the earliest Aryan documents—in the
Vedas, in which the deity Mitra or Mithra is one of the prominent
figures. <span id="fr_1411"></span>[1](#fn_1411.md) Seeing that there
already he duplicates with other deities, it may be that, to begin with,
the name was only a special epithet of the sun, <span
id="fr_1412"></span>[2](#fn_1412.md) the central force in later myth as in
our planetary system; and that it lay with the priests and their royal
patrons to determine which Name should be the most popular God, since
the whole evolution was one of words. In any case, it is in Aryan Persia
that the name of Mithra makes its fortune: in India it passes into the
background of the verbal host.

In the Rig-Veda it is frequently associated with Varuna <span
id="fr_1413"></span>[3](#fn_1413.md) and Agni; and in the Atharva-Veda
Mitra is so defined as to make his solar character certain. Of a deity
who stands in general for the principle of light, it is there said that
"In the evening he becomes Varuna Agni; in the morning he becomes Mitra
going forth," <span id="fr_1414"></span>[4](#fn_1414.md) an expression
which plainly points to the Sun-God. That Mithra was not developed into
a pre-eminent Vedic deity is to be proximately explained by the fact
that Agni, who as fire-God and light-God had similar attributes, was
better suited to the purposes of the highly-specialised priesthood which
built up the Vedas. The God of the sacrificial fire was eminently
adapted to sacerdotal ends; and it is in that respect that Agni is
oftenest presented. It may have been, indeed, that the Aryan invaders of
India had thus early assimilated in the case of Agni a popular pre-Aryan
(though not Hindu) worship, <span id="fr_1415"></span>[5](#fn_1415.md) as
they did later with the Hindu cult of Krishna; while in Persia the Aryan
Gods may have had a simpler course of development. On the other hand, it
seems probable that the Ahura Mazda

<span id="page_285">p. 285</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (Ormazd) of the
Persians is a variant of the Assyrian God-name Assara Mazas, and at
bottom identical with the God Assur or Asshur. <span
id="fr_1416"></span>[1](#fn_1416.md) On that view it is more likely that
the Aryans were influenced by the ancient Mesopotamian cults than *vice
versa*. <span id="fr_1417"></span>[2](#fn_1417.md) However that may be,
though we find the sacramental Vedic beverage the Soma preserved in the
Persian cult as the Haoma, that principle did not predominate; and
Mithra, in the character of Sun-God and War-God, grew in popular
importance. Of Agni, as a special personification of the sacred fire,
there is in the Persian system no other trace.

The Iranian documents which present to us what remains of the ancient
lore of Mithraism are for the most part contained in the collection
called the Zendavesta, a somewhat unfortunate title, since Zend
signifies, not, as was formerly supposed, a language, but "a commentary
or explanation"; and Avesta (from old Persian *âbastâ*, "the law") is
the proper name of the original texts, of which the language somewhat
resembles the modern Afghan. The collection is divided into two parts,
of which the first is the Avesta properly so-called, containing (1) the
Vendidâd, a compilation of religious laws and mythical tales; (2) the
Vispêrad, a set of litanies for the sacrifice; and (3) the Yasna,
consisting of other litanies and five hymns or Gâthas written in what
appears to be an older dialect than the rest. The second part is called
the Khorda (Small) Avesta, and contains short prayers for general
use—namely, five *Gâh*, thirty formularies of the Sîrôzah, three
*Âfrigân*, and six *Nyâyis*. It is usual to include in the Khorda,
though they do not strictly belong to it, the *Yashts*, hymns of praise
to the several Izads or lesser deities (who, however, here include
Mithra) and some fragments.

As to the age of the different portions there is considerable dispute.
In the opinion of the late M. James Darmesteter, one of the highest
authorities, certain quasi-scientific sections (*Nasks*) of the Avesta
were written as late as the middle of the third century of our era, in
imitation of Greek and Sanskrit scientific treatises; <span
id="fr_1418"></span>[3](#fn_1418.md) and the same scholar places the
important Hôm Yasht late in the second century. Much of the Vendidâd,
however, is reckoned pre-Alexandrian; and while M. Darmesteter held the
Gâthas to be post-Alexandrian, and very late in spirit albeit the oldest
texts in the

<span id="page_286">p. 286</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Avesta, other
students count them among the earliest items of all. <span
id="fr_1419"></span>[1](#fn_1419.md) Broadly speaking, the religion of the
Avesta, commonly called the Mazdean, from the God-name Ahura Mazda, is a
highly composite one; but "there are few instances of foreign elements
and concepts so freely borrowed by a religion and so harmoniously
blended in the original mould." <span id="fr_1420"></span>[2](#fn_1420.md)

<span id="fn_1419"></span>[286:1](pch63.htm#fr_1419.md) This is the view of
Mr. L. H. Mills, as it was that of Haug. The latter, however (*Essays on
the Parsis*, 3rd ed. pp. 257-260, 287), leaves his position somewhat
obscure, arguing as he does on the one hand that the Gâthas are the
oldest parts of the Zendavesta, and on the other that they *ignore*
Mithra and other Zendavestan Gods, the sacrifice of the Homa, etc.,
because Zoroaster did not believe in them. M. Darmesteter (Introd. to
the Zendavesta, vol. iv of "Sacred Books of the East" series, 2nd ed. p.
lxv) supposes the Gâthas to have been written (in a dead language)
between 100 B.C. and 100 C.E., and the Vendidâd still later, pronouncing
the latter a return to an older form of doctrine, however. Neither view
seems satisfactory. M. Darmesteter argues (pp. xlviii-ix), for instance,
(*a*) that one passage in the Hôm Yasht can best be understood as
referring to Alexander the Great, (*b*) that the Yasht is a "coherent
whole," and (*e*) that it is therefore as a whole post-Alexandrian. He
thus makes no allowance at this point for redactions or interpolations.
