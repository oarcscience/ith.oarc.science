#### § 8. The Judaic Evolution.

Rejecting, then, as not merely unwarranted but excluded by the evidence,
Dr. Frazer's assumption of the historicity of the crucifixion, we have
to note carefully the inferences which his research really warrants.
When these are drawn it will be found that his notable hypothesis does
not fall to the ground in its essentials. He has really added signally
to his former great services by bringing together the evidences for the
existence of a mock-kingly sacrifice among the Semites before the
Christian era, and by skilfully elucidating the whole primitive
psychology of such rituals. It needs only that his procedure be freed,
on the principles of scientific mythology, from the difficulty set up by
accepting one set of palpable myths as history. When criticism has done
its worst against his manipulation of the Sacæa, Zakmuk, and Purim, it
will be found that there remains clearly open the inference that certain
details of the crucifixion myth are drawn from some old Semitic rite
resembling the Sacæa, not by way of Purim in its Evemerised Jewish form,
but in a simpler form, in which there was no Ishtar or Merodach. <span
id="fr_694"></span>[1](#fn_694.md)

Precisely because the practice of human sacrifice to the Vegetation-God
was so nearly universal as Dr. Frazer has shown it to be, it is
unnecessary to assume that the Jews owed their variant of it solely to a
late contact with another nation. The Athenians had in their Thargelia,
which like the Passover was a feast of first fruits, <span
id="fr_695"></span>[2](#fn_695.md) a usage of human sacrifice which as we
have seen corresponded at points with the Babylonian, inasmuch as the
victims were maintained in potentially riotous ease, and were latterly
chosen from the criminal class, though they cannot originally have been
so. The sacrifice, indeed, does not seem to have belonged to the earlier
worship of Apollo at all, <span id="fr_696"></span>[3](#fn_696.md) and the
calling of the victims *pharmakoi*, "medicine-men," suggests an
adaptation of a West-Asiatic usage, the more so as quasi-Semitic
sacrifices were in use among the Eretrians and Magnesians. <span
id="fr_697"></span>[4](#fn_697.md) In all likelihood this was the very
sacrifice of purification said to have been prescribed to the
plague-stricken Athenians

<span id="page_149">p. 149</span>

by the Cretan Epimenides, <span id="fr_698"></span>[1](#fn_698.md) when two
youths voluntarily gave themselves as victims. <span
id="fr_699"></span>[2](#fn_699.md) But if the Athenians could take such a
rite from Crete or Asia Minor, there is reason to conclude that it was
known in Palestine, in a simpler form than the Babylonian, before the
exile. That there were such forms is to be inferred from both early and
late evidence.

Firstly, we have the whole tradition of the Passover, with which, and
not with Purim, the crucifixion myth comes chronologically in touch on
the face of the case. Among the aspects of the gospel myth which the
analogy of the Sacæa leaves untouched are (1) the mourning for the
victim; (2) his alleged divinity and his titles of Son of God and Son of
Man; (3) his participation in a sacramental meal in which his flesh is
mystically eaten; (4) his execution along with two criminals; (5) his
resurrection; (6) his subsequent status as Messiah or Christos. Now, the
first three of those characteristics are as cognate with the paschal
rite as they are alien to Purim; the fourth can be shown historically to
connect with paschal usage; and the others develop naturally from the
preceding. That there is no need to go to Purim for an actual killing or
sacrificing of quasi-royal victims or malefactors in connection with a
sacrificial festival appears from the legend of the hanging of seven
king's sons "before the Lord," an event which happens according to the
narrative at the barley harvest, that is, at the time of the
Passover. <span id="fr_700"></span>[3](#fn_700.md)

In the face of this familiar record it is obliviously asserted by Mr.
Lang that "sacrificed victims are not hanged." <span
id="fr_701"></span>[4](#fn_701.md) He has given thirteen cases of human
sacrifice in which victims were not hanged, but has apparently not
consulted his Bible. Now, the expressions "before the Lord" and "unto
the Lord" mean sacrifice or nothing; <span
id="fr_702"></span>[5](#fn_702.md) and that the hanging of Saul's sons was
by way of propitiation is clear from the remark in the context that
"after that, God was intreated for the land." <span
id="fr_703"></span>[6](#fn_703.md) Further, hanging is the mode not only in
the sacrificing of Saul's sons but in the offering up "unto the Lord"

<span id="page_150">p. 150</span>

of the heads of the people as described in Numbers xxv, 4. Equally
sacrificial, in spirit and in occasion, though the usual formula is not
applied to it, is the hanging of the five kings by Joshua in the
pseudo-history; and in the case of his hanging of the king of Ai, where
the procedure is exactly the same, it is explicitly told, in the Hebrew,
that he "devoted" all the people of Ai, as he had done those of
Jericho. <span id="fr_704"></span>[1](#fn_704.md) As Ai is an imaginary
city, <span id="fr_705"></span>[2](#fn_705.md) we must conclude that the
legend points to a customary rite. Finally, a comparison of a passage in
Deuteronomy in which *every* hanged man is declared to be "the curse of
God," <span id="fr_706"></span>[3](#fn_706.md) with the passages cited from
the book of Joshua, proves that "the curse of God" meant "devoted to
God," <span id="fr_707"></span>[4](#fn_707.md) since in the former the
course prescribed is precisely that followed in the pseudo-history,
namely, the taking down and burying of the victim within the day. Thus
*all* hanged men were in ancient Jewry sacrifices to the Sun-God or the
Rain-God, <span id="fr_708"></span>[5](#fn_708.md) and the Pauline epistle
unconsciously clinches the point in citing the misunderstood text. <span
id="fr_709"></span>[6](#fn_709.md) It may in fact be taken as historically
certain that human sacrifice in this aspect was a recognised part of
Hebrew religion down till the Exile. <span
id="fr_710"></span>[7](#fn_710.md)

And here, as at so many other points, we find a specific parallel
between Hebrew usage and that of the natives of Africa. At the death of
a Nigerian chief or notable, the slaves slain to "raise him up by the
head and feet" are buried with him; and others are "hung in the
different compartments of the house" and in the street or roadway; the
heads of these being afterwards cut off and regarded as conveying
luck. <span id="fr_711"></span>[8](#fn_711.md) Again, near a certain Long
Juju shrine in Southern Nigeria, where human sacrifice was regularly
practised until its capture by the British troops, it was noted that
beside a minor temple at Ibum were "trees on which murderers and thieves
used to be hanged." <span id="fr_712"></span>[9](#fn_712.md) That the
hanging had a religious significance is proved by the fact that when the
capture took place there was

<span id="page_151">p. 151</span>

found "the last sacrifice, a white goat, trussed up in the branches of a
palm-tree and starving to death." <span id="fr_713"></span>[1](#fn_713.md)
And it is expressly explained concerning the sacrifice of a woman to the
Rain-God at Benin that "a woman was taken, a prayer made over her, and
*a message saluting the Rain-God put in her mouth;* then she was clubbed
to death and put up in the execution-tree" \[St. Andrew's-cross-wise\]
"*so that the rain might see*." <span id="fr_714"></span>[2](#fn_714.md)

Semitic usage is all that need be proved in the present connection; but
it may be further noted (1) that animal victims were hanged to a tree in
the cult of the Syrian Goddess in the second century of our era; <span
id="fr_715"></span>[3](#fn_715) (2.md) that human victims were bound or
hanged to trees in the sacrificial rites of the pre-Christian
Mexicans; <span id="fr_716"></span>[4](#fn_716) (3.md) that human victims
were frequently if not habitually hanged in sacrifice to Odin, <span
id="fr_717"></span>[5](#fn_717.md) as well as to other Teutonic
deities; <span id="fr_718"></span>[6](#fn_718) (4.md) that in certain cases
of human sacrifice in Tahiti the slain victim was "suspended from the
sacred tree"; <span id="fr_719"></span>[7](#fn_719) (5.md) that the devoted
bodies of slain enemies were hanged on a tree by the Tongans; <span
id="fr_720"></span>[8](#fn_720) (6.md) that among Obubura natives a lamb in
a propitiatory sacrifice was "fastened into the topmost prong of a pole"
and set up, with a palm branch on which was impaled a yam, at the
entrance of the compound; <span id="fr_721"></span>[9](#fn_721) (7.md) that
some of the northern Native Americans hanged dogs to poles with running
knots "in honour of their divinities"; that the nomads similarly
attached skins of wild beasts to trees; and that the Floridans elevated
other offerings. <span id="fr_722"></span>[10](#fn_722.md) It is
significant that among the early Odin-worshippers, as among Greeks and
Semites, king's sons were sacrificed in substitution for their fathers;
and that latterly slaves and criminals were substituted in such
rites. <span id="fr_723"></span>[11](#fn_723.md) From the nature of the
case, too, it is probable that the victim was hanged not by the neck but
by the hands. <span id="fr_724"></span>[12](#fn_724.md) In some of the
Scandinavian cases the victim was wounded with a javelin as well as
hanged; and one myth specifies a hanging which lasted nine nights. <span
id="fr_725"></span>[13](#fn_725.md) In any

<span id="page_152">p. 152</span>

case, hanging by the wrists was the normal mode of ancient "crucifixion"
so-called. <span id="fr_726"></span>[1](#fn_726.md)

But, further, it is clear that the Passover rite, of which the narrative
in Exodus is a fictitious account, was originally one of sacrifice of
firstlings, <span id="fr_727"></span>[2](#fn_727.md) including the
first-born sons; and the conflicting laws on the subject prove that only
with difficulty was the substitution of lambs for children carried
out. <span id="fr_728"></span>[3](#fn_728.md) To this day, at least among
continental Jews, <span id="fr_729"></span>[4](#fn_729.md) the principle of
"redemption" is ritually recognised, in the festival ceremony of *Pidyen
Haben*. A month after the birth of a first son, a friendly Cohen is
selected to officiate, who sacerdotally asks certain questions of the
mother, one being, "Is this child the first fruit of your womb?" If he
be poor, he receives a small fee; <span id="fr_730"></span>[5](#fn_730.md)
if not, the mother throws a small gold chain round his neck; and he in
return, during certain prayers, puts it round the neck of the child, who
is thus "redeemed." And that the first-born were at one time set apart
as a victim-*class*, <span id="fr_731"></span>[6](#fn_731.md) liable either
to be sacrificed or to be employed as *hierodouloi*, appears from the
announcement of Yahweh in the priestly code: "I have taken the Levites
from among the children of Israel instead of all the first-born......and
the Levites shall be mine; for all the first-born are mine." <span
id="fr_732"></span>[7](#fn_732.md)

As regards the private continuance of the practice after the Levites had
been set apart as a specific tribe, we can only inferentially trace the
evolution. Certainly the priesthood did not of itself set up the
movement against child sacrifice: such reforms always begin through
rulers or lay reformers, never through the priestly organisation, save
when a new cult supersedes an old. <span id="fr_733"></span>[8](#fn_733.md)
Circumcision,

<span id="page_153">p. 153</span>

a rite of sacrifice with the same significance, <span
id="fr_734"></span>[1](#fn_734.md) seems to have been introduced, or at
least stressed, comparatively late, <span
id="fr_735"></span>[2](#fn_735.md) for the same purpose; and as an official
Yahwistic feast the Passover seems also late; <span
id="fr_736"></span>[3](#fn_736.md) though the manner of its enactment in
the first redaction of the law indicates that it was in some form
already a standing practice. <span id="fr_737"></span>[4](#fn_737.md) It
doubtless needed the late myths of Abraham and Isaac <span
id="fr_738"></span>[5](#fn_738.md) and of the Exodus to persuade even
Yahwists to drop the child sacrifice; and in the rival cults the
practice seems to have been common. <span
id="fr_739"></span>[6](#fn_739.md) It is in this connection that there
presumptively occurred the usage first of breaking the victims’ limbs,
and later of drugging them, to prevent the struggles which were usually
held to make a sacrifice inauspicious; <span
id="fr_740"></span>[7](#fn_740.md) and the manner in which the caveat
against breaking the bones of the paschal lamb is introduced—an apparent
interpolation made at the close of the original narrative of the
exodus <span id="fr_741"></span>[8](#fn_741.md)—indicates it to be either a
late provision against a practice which definitely recalled the rite of
human sacrifice, or a specific assertion of the principle that the
victim must be without blemish, as against the practice of a human
sacrifice in which the victim had to be either maimed or drugged in
order to make him seem willing. But, as in the practice of the Khonds,
so in that of the Jews, the principle that the victim must be "bought
with a price" is visibly a later development, grafted on the other.
Originally the victim is voluntary; this is his special sacrificial
virtue. When the voluntary victim can no longer be procured, one "bought
with a price," being the property of the sacrificers, is the next best
thing; and in his case "willingness" is ostensibly secured by trick,
bribe, or brutality. The underlying reasoning is of a piece.

We are faced again, however, by the difficult problem of the historic
transmission of such usages. On the whole the evidence from anthropology
goes far to support the thesis, otherwise well made out, of the Asiatic
derivation of the Oceanic peoples. <span id="fr_742"></span>[9](#fn_742.md)
In certain South Sea Islands in modern times, when the practices of

<span id="page_154">p. 154</span>

human sacrifice and cannibalism had latterly dwindled, <span
id="fr_743"></span>[1](#fn_743.md) the first missionaries found in use
forms of animal sacrifice which seem to affiliate at many points to the
ritual we have seen in operation among Khonds and westerly Semites. Thus
the pigs set apart for sacrifice <span id="fr_744"></span>[2](#fn_744.md)
at certain temples, "when presented alive, received the sacred mark, and
ranged the district at liberty; when slain, they were exceedingly
anxious to avoid breaking a bone, or disfiguring the animal. One method
of killing them was by holding the pig upright on its legs, placing a
strong stick horizontally under its throat, and another across upon its
neck, and then pressing them together until the animal was
strangled." <span id="fr_745"></span>[3](#fn_745) Here we have (1.md) the
common Asiatic and American usage of leaving the doomed victim for a
time at liberty; <span id="fr_746"></span>[4](#fn_746) (2.md) the avoidance
of bone-breaking, <span id="fr_747"></span>[5](#fn_747.md) as in the case
of the paschal lamb; (3) the preservation of the cross-figure as seen in
the Khond sacrifice; and (4) the evident imitation of human sacrifice in
the posture of the victim. <span id="fr_748"></span>[6](#fn_748.md) Seeing,
further, that only a portion of the pig thus sacrificed was eaten, and
that only by "the priests and other sacred persons who were privileged
to eat of the sacrifices," the remainder being left on the God's altar
till it decomposed, we may fairly surmise that it was a surrogate for a
sacrificed human being, formerly eaten as a sacrament in the Aztec
fashion.

Among the natives of South Nigeria who practised human sacrifice and
ritual cannibalism down till the beginning of the twentieth century, we
again find the use of the cross-figure. The victims sacrificed for rain
were stretched on a rude scaffolding in the form of the St. Andrew's
cross; and goats, as we have seen, were similarly "trussed."
"Crucifixion" of a kind, as we have seen, was practised at Benin: and
the term is frequently used by eye-witnesses in describing the treatment
of victims." <span id="fr_749"></span>[7](#fn_749.md) The usual form of
sacrifice," says Gallwey, "is crucifixion." <span
id="fr_750"></span>[8](#fn_750.md) Yet again, some of the women-slaves
sacrificed, at the approach of the punitive expedition

<span id="page_155">p. 155</span>

to Benin, had the "abdominal wall cut in the form of a cross." There are
traces, too, of leg-breaking, one goat being found by the punitive
expedition at Benin with its legs broken, as a native explained, "to
prevent white man coming"; <span id="fr_751"></span>[1](#fn_751.md) and
Burton tells of a victim whose legs "had been broken at mid-shin with
awful violence." <span id="fr_752"></span>[2](#fn_752.md) He also records
that "a slave bound for the other world is always plied with a bottle of
rum before the fatal cord is made fast." <span
id="fr_753"></span>[3](#fn_753.md) In Uganda the usage of limb-breaking is
found to have been common. The God Kitimba or Kitinda of Damba and
elsewhere was represented by a crocodile, his "priest," and to appease
him men were sacrificed to the crocodiles in the lake. The victim was
taken to the brink, "where his knees and elbows were broken, so that he
could not crawl away," <span id="fr_754"></span>[4](#fn_754.md) whereafter
the crocodiles came and devoured him. <span
id="fr_755"></span>[5](#fn_755.md) Here the primary motive is unusually
clear; and it is noted that in the case of the victims thrown alive into
the pit-grave of the chief among some tribes there is no limb-breaking,
they being unable to escape. <span id="fr_756"></span>[6](#fn_756.md) It is
not impossible that limb-breaking originated in this simple fashion, and
later became a ritual usage with an ethical connotation. But among the
Manyema of the same African region, on the other hand, we find that at
the burial of a chief ten women victims had their legs and arms broken
at the knees and elbows and were thrown into the grave; the king's dead
body, wrapped in bark-cloth, was laid upon theirs; and then ten men
victims were similarly treated, and their bodies laid over the
king's. <span id="fr_757"></span>[7](#fn_757.md) Thus the idea of simulated
"willingness" cannot be confidently excluded from even the most
primitive phenomena. The main reason for doubt is the fact that in
ordinary burial the limbs of the dead are by the same peoples broken at
the elbows and knees to admit of their being placed in the sitting
posture <span id="fr_758"></span>[8](#fn_758.md)—a practice which, however,
is ascribed to certain of the North American Indian tribes <span
id="fr_759"></span>[9](#fn_759.md) without any mention of limb-breaking
being resorted to. And in the sacrifices of slaves at the death of
chiefs, as practised

<span id="page_156">p. 156</span>

in the Sandwich Islands when they were visited by Captain Cook, the
victims were clubbed suddenly, having "not the most distant intimation
of their fate." <span id="fr_760"></span>[1](#fn_760.md) Here the exclusion
of willingness is so complete that we are led to infer a late and, so to
speak, debased form of the rite.

Yet again, there is a solitary testimony that in the human sacrifices
offered by the Algonkins at the beginning of the hunting season it was a
rule that not a bone of the victim must be broken. <span
id="fr_761"></span>[2](#fn_761.md) Seeing that other Native Americans
observed the principle of the Semites, that at the sacrificial feast the
victim "must be all eaten, and nothing left," <span
id="fr_762"></span>[3](#fn_762.md) there would thus seem to be not merely
an ancient racial affinity between the aborigines of America and some
race or races of Asia, but a direct heredity in the matter of special
primitive rites. But even if we waive the latter presumption, we can
infer the probable line of movement all round in the matter of the
usages under notice. As thus:—

1\. Originally a "willing" victim is desiderated; and willingness is
secured by the bribe of a period of ease and licence.

2\. This kind of victim becoming hard to procure, one "bought with a
price" was substituted, as representing a voluntary offering by his
owner or owners.

3\. Still seeking the semblance of a "willing" sacrifice, the
sacrificers first broke the limbs of the human victim.

4\. Feeling (on some reformer's urging) that such a mangled victim was
an unseemly sacrifice, they resorted to narcotics.

5\. At a higher stage of social evolution, recoiling from the sacrifice
of an innocent victim, men fall back upon condemned criminals, and these
in turn are stupefied, from humane or other motives.

6\. Being next persuaded that the stupefied victim was either an
unseemly or an inefficacious because non-suffering sacrifice, or being
on other grounds inclined to abandon human sacrifice, they substituted
the old sacrifice of an animal, giving it in certain cases human
attributes, and in others some of the privileges formerly accorded to
the *taboo* human victim. In the case of the animal it was not as a rule
felt necessary either to break bones or to use narcotics, though either
plan might be used. But reformers would stress the avoidance of
bone-breaking by way of showing the

<span id="page_157">p. 157</span>

superiority of the new sacrifice; hence the need for a veto on
imitations of the old practice. <span id="fr_763"></span>[1](#fn_763.md)

Such an evolution might conceivably take place independently in
different communities. It is true indeed that in the redemptory
sacrifices offered by modern Semites for boys, care is taken not to
break a bone, "because they fear that if a bone of the sacrifice should
be broken, the child's bones would be broken too"; <span
id="fr_764"></span>[2](#fn_764.md) but that appears to be a theory framed
subsequent to and not antecedent to a reform.

It is of the nature of such reforms, however, to be introduced with
difficulty and to be rebelled against and reverted from; and even
without the above-cited evidence of a slowly-wrought transformation in
Hebrew usage, it is certain, from the whole drift of religious history,
that the practice of child-slaying, which was systematically legislated
against only after the exile, would be revived in times of trouble by
Jews, as we know it to have been by Carthaginians. It is through
reversions of this kind to old and terrible rites, then, that we must
suppose the ancient mode of sacrifice to have been kept in men's
knowledge. Such a doctrine rested on the most obvious and therefore the
most fully developed side of the conception of sacrifice—the offering to
the God of a peculiarly precious gift, representing a maximum of
self-deprivation in the sacrificers.

Meanwhile, though it is not certain that the mode of "hanging before the
Lord" by the wrists ever placed the victim in the form of a cross, as
has been done in our own time at Benin, it would appear that the rite of
the Passover was closely associated with the cross sign. <span
id="fr_765"></span>[3](#fn_765.md) That is the "mark" specified in
Ezekiel <span id="fr_766"></span>[4](#fn_766.md) for the saving of the
elect from a general massacre; and the blood mark placed on the
doorposts and lintels at the Passover <span
id="fr_767"></span>[5](#fn_767.md) is inferentially the same, <span
id="fr_768"></span>[6](#fn_768.md) as is the "seal" on the foreheads of the
saved in the Apocalypse. To this day, the Arabs make the *tau*-mark with
sacrificial blood on at least one Moslem shrine. <span
id="fr_769"></span>[7](#fn_769.md) In any case, the pre-Christian use of
the

<span id="page_158">p. 158</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Cross as a symbol
of the Sun-God and as a sign of "immortal life" is undisputed, and we
shall see reason to infer that the form of slaying represented in the
Christian crucifix—which does not appear in Christian art till about the
seventh century <span id="fr_770"></span>[1](#fn_770.md)—was conceived from
certain rites in which the initiate extended his arms upon a tree or
cross, <span id="fr_771"></span>[2](#fn_771.md) probably in reminiscence of
some such mode of treating the sacrificed victim as we have seen
described in the case of the Khonds.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_694"></span>[148:1](pch35.htm#fr_694.md) Much of Mr. Lang's
criticism of Dr. Frazer's theory turns on the fact that it seeks to
combine a great many disparate sacrificial motives. This is not
absolutely an effective objection, inasmuch as religion is full of
inconsistencies; but Dr. Frazer imputes too much power of combination to
a given cult. *Popular* sacrifice must clearly subsist on a simple
basis. And there may have been forced changes, as the Sacæa is said by
Strabo to as have name of a Persian Goddess (Strabo, xi, 8, § 5). Cp.

plain and Jordan valley at passover time, and became general in the
uplands in the next month, wheat ripening later. In Egypt the harvests
are still earlier, flax and barley being harvested in March, and wheat
in April. Mr. Lang (*Magic and Religion*, p. 116-117) has overlooked the
fact that a feast could thus be at once a harvest feast and "vernal."
The Thargelia in May was in similar case.

Mr. Lang (*Magic and Religion*, p. 53) will not admit that any people
ever practised such a yearly massacre of first-born children as Dr.
Frazer infers. But Mr. Lang pays no heed to the conflicting laws here
specified, some of which insist on the "devoting" of all first-born
males, human as well as animals, while the others prescribe that the
human males shall be "redeemed." Both sets of laws are utterly
inexplicable save on the theory of an original practice of
child-sacrifice. Cp. the admissions of A. Réville, *Prolégomènes*, p.
185; and Kuenen, ii, 30, 90-94. As to child-sacrifice in other races,

<span id="fn_731"></span>[152:6](pch35.htm#fr_731.md) It is noteworthy that
among the Tahitians, when a victim was taken from any family, the rest
were held to be "devoted"—a conception partly analogous to that of the
Khonds. J. Williams, *Narrative of Missionary Enterprise*s, 1837, p.
554. Cp. W. Ellis, *Polynesian Researches*, 2nd ed. i, 347. The same
principle was noted among the Native Americans (Lafitau, ii, 307). In
Mangaia there was a series of tribes "devoted to furnish human
sacrifices" (Gill, *Myths and Songs of the South Pacific*, pp. 24,
36-38, 290, 300, 302). And the story of the Messenian and Achæan
sacrifices in Pausanias (iv, 9) and Herodotus (vii, 197) specify a
particular family which must supply the victim.

<span id="fn_732"></span>[152:7](pch35.htm#fr_732.md) Num. iii, 12. There

device of putting barley or water in the ear of the sacrificial ox at
the altar, to make him bow his head as if signifying willingness to be
slain, is found to be closely paralleled in recent times in the
sacrifices of the Aryan Káfirs of the Hindu-Kush, who were particularly
solicitous on the point. So also the Hindu Thugs. See Sir G. S.

<span id="fn_744"></span>[154:2](pch35.htm#fr_744.md) Dr. Jevons argues (p.
161) that human sacrifice arose in Polynesia because of lack of domestic
animals, there being only pigs and rats. But the pigs could have
sufficed in early times as well as late; and the negroes of Africa have
freely offered both kinds. And why did not Australians, lacking domestic
animals, set up or continue human sacrifices 2 Because men were scarce,
probably.

rarely......sacrifices men without stupefying them with drink or drugs."
Roth notes that "the descriptions of human sacrifices given by Landolphe
and Beauvais do not leave the impression that the victims were
intoxicated before being killed" (p. 64, *note*). At Benin, as
elsewhere, the drugging was apparently a late device. Latterly it was
common. *Id*. p. 84.

<span id="fn_754"></span>[155:4](pch35.htm#fr_754.md) J. F. Cunningham,
*Uganda and its Peoples*, 1905, pp. 88-89. Cp. pp. 188, 217-218, 318.
Sometimes 200 or 300 men were sacrificed at a time. On the occasion of
the finishing of a king's palace, as many as 700 were at times
slaughtered to the leopard-demon.

<span id="fn_755"></span>[155:5](pch35.htm#fr_755.md) In this connection it
is significant that in the time of Herodotus anyone seized and killed by
a crocodile was treated as a divine victim, and buried with special
reverence as something more than human" (ii, 90)—evidently a survival
from the ancient rite of human sacrifice.

<span id="fn_763"></span>[157:1](pch35.htm#fr_763.md) What looks like a
reminiscence of the old sacrificial practice is described by W. Ellis
(i, 310) as occurring after battles, when the legs and arms of the dead
bodies of defeated warriors were broken and the bodies hung by the neck,
and moved up and down "for the amusement of the spectators."

<span id="fn_765"></span>[157:3](pch35.htm#fr_765.md) There is a passage in
Justin Martyr (*Dial. with Trypho*, xl) which seems to assert that the
paschal lamb was "roasted and dressed in the form of the cross"; whence
it would follow that the original human victim had been crucified, or
bound somewhat in the manner of the Khond sacrifice. It is not known,
however, whether roasted lambs in general may not have been dressed in
the same fashion.
