#### § 4. Vogue of Human Sacrifice.

Given the *prima facie* fitness of the hypothesis, however, there at
once arises the question, What positive evidence have we for the
existence in the Mediterranean world of any such man-sacrificing ritual
about the beginning of the Christian era?

As to the commonness of the practice among "savage" or primitive
peoples, there is no question. It is frequent to this day in parts of
Africa, <span id="fr_489"></span>[2](#fn_489.md) and in the Malay
Archipelago; <span id="fr_490"></span>[3](#fn_490.md) it is probably not
wholly obsolete in India; <span id="fr_491"></span>[4](#fn_491.md) and it
occurs from time to time in primitive Russia, among ignorant and
fanatical peasants. <span id="fr_492"></span>[5](#fn_492.md) In Polynesia
and Maori New Zealand it was normal in the past century; and among
Native Americans it occurred, as a religious usage in war time, as late
as 1837. <span id="fr_493"></span>[6](#fn_493.md) And the ancient
testimonies show the practice at no distant time to have subsisted among
nearly all the races then known, especially among the Semites and the
"barbarians." Despite some allegations to the contrary, human sacrifices
were normal among all branches of the Aryan race. <span
id="fr_494"></span>[7](#fn_494.md) Lusitanians, <span
id="fr_495"></span>[8](#fn_495.md) Gauls, <span
id="fr_496"></span>[9](#fn_496.md) and Teutons <span
id="fr_497"></span>[10](#fn_497.md) alike, at the period of their contact
with the Romans, normally

<span id="page_123">p. 123</span>

sacrificed to their Gods captives and prisoners, sometimes by
burning, <span id="fr_498"></span>[1](#fn_498.md) sometimes by
hanging, <span id="fr_499"></span>[2](#fn_499.md) sometimes by
crucifying, <span id="fr_500"></span>[3](#fn_500.md) sometimes by
throat-cutting or other letting of blood. <span
id="fr_501"></span>[4](#fn_501.md) Of the ancient Slays we have equivalent
records. <span id="fr_502"></span>[5](#fn_502.md) Among some tribes of the
more easterly Galatæ <span id="fr_503"></span>[6](#fn_503.md) and the
Massagetæ <span id="fr_504"></span>[7](#fn_504.md) and other
Scythians <span id="fr_505"></span>[8](#fn_505.md) similar usages were
reported; and while human sacrifices had in the time of Herodotus, by
his account, long ceased to be offered in Egypt, <span
id="fr_506"></span>[9](#fn_506.md) the memory of them was, to say the
least, sufficiently fresh among the Greeks and Romans. <span
id="fr_507"></span>[10](#fn_507.md)

The records of the substitution of a goat for a boy in sacrifice to
Dionysos at Potniæ, <span id="fr_508"></span>[11](#fn_508.md) and of a hart
in substitution for a virgin at Laodicea; <span
id="fr_509"></span>[12](#fn_509.md) the stories of King Athamas, called
upon by the Delphic oracle to sacrifice his firstborn son Phryxos, <span
id="fr_510"></span>[13](#fn_510.md) of King Lycaon who sacrificed a child
to Zeus, <span id="fr_511"></span>[14](#fn_511.md) of Aristodemos offering
up his child on the call of the oracle when the method of the lot
failed, <span id="fr_512"></span>[15](#fn_512.md) and of Menelaos
sacrificing two children in Egypt when stayed by contrary winds, <span
id="fr_513"></span>[16](#fn_513.md) tell of a once recognised conception
and practice; and those of the sacrificing of three Persian boys to
Dionysos Omêstês at the battle of Salamis, <span
id="fr_514"></span>[17](#fn_514.md) and of seven children by the Persians
to the God of the Underworld when they were entering Greece, <span
id="fr_515"></span>[18](#fn_515.md) are equally significant. Among the
Eretrians and Magnesians, again, sacrifices of human firstlings were
said to have been anciently offered; <span
id="fr_516"></span>[19](#fn_516.md) in Sparta, in Chios, and in
Tenedos, <span id="fr_517"></span>[20](#fn_517.md) there were similar
memories; and the custom was notoriously well established in
Thrace. <span id="fr_518"></span>[21](#fn_518.md) There is reason, too, to
infer an act of child sacrifice behind Pausanias’s tale of the infant
placed in the forefront of an Elean army. <span
id="fr_519"></span>[22](#fn_519.md)

Anciently, it would seem, human sacrifice of all kinds was

<span id="page_124">p. 124</span>

common to the Hellene stock; <span id="fr_520"></span>[1](#fn_520.md) and
the attempts of Mr. Gladstone and others to elevate that race by
ascribing their unquestioned acts to the influence of their neighbours,
merely substitute a confession of weak imitativeness for one of savage
proclivity.

The sacrificing of children in particular may or may not have spread
from the Semites, among whom it was at one time normal, <span
id="fr_521"></span>[2](#fn_521.md) as it was among the pre-Christian
Mexicans and Peruvians, <span id="fr_522"></span>[3](#fn_522.md) and seems
to have been till quite recently among the northern Zulus. <span
id="fr_523"></span>[4](#fn_523.md) Female infants were frequently put to
death among the Arabs before Mohammed, <span
id="fr_524"></span>[5](#fn_524.md) whether or not by way of sacrifice; as
they have been in China and elsewhere in Asia in recent times; <span
id="fr_525"></span>[6](#fn_525.md) and they were sacrificed on special
grounds in the South Sea Islands <span id="fr_526"></span>[7](#fn_526.md)
before the arrival of the missionaries. Among the North American Indians
propitiatory sacrifices of children are known to have occurred in the
nineteenth century. <span id="fr_527"></span>[8](#fn_527.md) It was among
the Semites, in any case, that they were most common in the
Mediterranean world. The standing provision in the Hebrew code, and the
stories of Abraham and Isaac and Jephthah's daughter tell of a once
regular practice; and the Greek and Latin testimonies as to Carthaginian
usage are overwhelming. <span id="fr_528"></span>[9](#fn_528.md) The
association of Carians with Greeks in the sacrifice of the sons of
Phanes in the Perso-Egyptian war—a rite consummated by the drinking of
their blood, mixed with wine and water—suggests the preponderance of
eastern influence, especially as regards the sacramental
conception. <span id="fr_529"></span>[10](#fn_529.md)

Such practices gradually became more and more rare among the civilised
peoples, and are held to have subsisted latterly in only one or two
places in the civilised parts of the Roman Empire; <span
id="fr_530"></span>[11](#fn_530.md) and there are various traces of the
gradual process of mitigation. In the Leucadian sacrifice of a man to
Apollo by throwing him from a rock into the sea—of which Strabo
preserves the memory. <span id="fr_531"></span>[12](#fn_531.md)—the last
stage

<span id="page_125">p. 125</span>

seems to have been one in which not only was the victim a condemned
criminal, but attempts were made to ease his fall by attaching to him
wings and even birds, while many men waited below, in boats, to rescue
him and carry him beyond the boundaries, Such mitigations were likely to
be common; <span id="fr_532"></span>[1](#fn_532.md) but it is on record
that only in the time of Hadrian was the annual human sacrifice to Zeus
abolished at Salamis in Cyprus; <span id="fr_533"></span>[2](#fn_533.md)
and the possibility of either secret or open survivals in Asia Minor in
the first century would thus seem to be considerable. There are, indeed,
indications which cannot be put aside, of occasional resort to human
sacrifice in the Greek-speaking world in modern times. <span
id="fr_534"></span>[3](#fn_534.md) The stories of its practice by
Elagabalus seem not impossible; <span id="fr_535"></span>[4](#fn_535.md)
and the various accounts of the manner of the sacrifice of a slave by
the Catalinarian conspirators may point to various forms of
survival. <span id="fr_536"></span>[5](#fn_536.md)

To begin with, we have Strabo's account of human sacrifice as being
practised in his time by the primitive Albanians, who lived south of the
Caucasian mountains and west of the Caspian sea, in the land watered by
the Cyrus and the Araxes. Under the high-priest of the Moon-Goddess were
a number of "sacred" slaves (*hierodouloi*); and when one of these
became divinely possessed and wandered alone in the woods he was seized,
bound with sacred fetters, and maintained sumptuously for a year. When
the festival day came he was *anointed* with a fragrant ointment, and
slain by being *pierced to the heart with a sacred lance through the
side*. Auguries were then drawn from the manner of his fall, and the
body was carried away to a certain spot and ceremonially trampled upon
by all as a means of purification. <span id="fr_537"></span>[6](#fn_537.md)
Here we have a sacrifice corresponding in one notable detail to one of
the gospel narratives, and having other marked features in common with
other well-known rites of human sacrifice. <span
id="fr_538"></span>[7](#fn_538.md) In the annual spring sacrifice at
Salamis, again, the victim was led thrice round the altar (as in the
rite of the Karhâda Brahmans), then pierced by the priest with a lance,
and the corpse was finally burned on a pyre. <span
id="fr_539"></span>[8](#fn_539.md) And that this mode

<span id="page_126">p. 126</span>

of sacrifice in turn had a far-eastern origin or precedent may be
inferred from the manner of the buffalo-sacrifice of the Bataks of
Sumatra <span id="fr_540"></span>[1](#fn_540.md) to the "Sombaon"—a term
expressive of sacro-sanctity. In certain cases the buffalo is tied to a
stake which has been decked and dedicated; the slayer is robed, and
crowned with leaves; and he spears the victim in the side after asking
the onlookers, "Shall I spear?" In all likelihood the buffalo is a
surrogate for an ancient human sacrifice.

Later testimony brings us closer to civilisation in the same period.
Tertullian is not the best of witnesses; and when he asserts that
children are secretly sacrificed by non-Christians in Carthage in his
own day, <span id="fr_541"></span>[2](#fn_541.md) he is but doing what he
denounces the pagans for doing as against his own sect—publishing a
rumour which had never been investigated. But when he tells that
children were publicly sacrificed to Saturn as late as the proconsulship
of Tiberius, who therefore "crucified" a number of priests on the sacred
trees beside their temple, he is saying something that squares with a
good deal of testimony as to Semitic practices. Thus we have the
explicit record <span id="fr_542"></span>[3](#fn_542.md) that Hamilcar
sacrificed his own son at the siege of Agrigentum, 407 B.C., and the
many testimonies as to wholesale sacrifices of children among the
Carthaginians. There is good evidence that an annual sacrifice of a boy
to Kronos had anciently taken place at Tyre, but that it was given up,
the citizens refusing to renew it when the city was besieged by
Alexander; and the writer who records this also asserts that the
Carthaginians maintained the practice of one annual sacrifice till the
destruction of their city. <span id="fr_543"></span>[4](#fn_543.md) To the
same effect, Pliny alleges <span id="fr_544"></span>[5](#fn_544.md) that
the victim was annually sacrificed before the image of Hercules—that is,
Melkarth. Even the lack of agreement as to dates of cessation is a proof
that such usages could subsist without exciting much concern in the more
civilised sections of the Roman empire. The story of the ecclesiastical
historian Sokrates, <span id="fr_545"></span>[6](#fn_545.md) to the effect
that the Mithraists in Alexandria had habitually offered human
sacrifices to Mithra down till somewhere before or after the year 300,
is on the face of it worthless; <span id="fr_546"></span>[7](#fn_546.md)
but that there had been such sacrifices at Alexandria at some period is
not incredible. Among the Arabs, it seems certain, human sacrifices
subsisted in the generation before Mohammed; <span
id="fr_547"></span>[8](#fn_547.md)

<span id="page_127">p. 127</span>

among the Japanese, they flourished later still; <span
id="fr_548"></span>[1](#fn_548.md) among the Hindus, as we have seen, they
have lasted down to our own time among the primitives.

In view of the importance of this point to our inquiry, it has to be
remarked, first, that there is no clear record of the date of cessation
of the human sacrifices in the Thargelia at Athens. The historians pass
over these matters with no apparent sense of the social and moral
significance of such a problem. Grote does not so much as mention the
Thargelia in connection with the practice of human sacrifice; and even
Dr. Frazer <span id="fr_549"></span>[2](#fn_549.md) remarks that "the
Athenians regularly maintained" a number of possible victims, without
suggesting any period for the usage. Professor Mahaffy, on whom as a
culture-historian the problem pressed, makes a notable admission. "I
think," he writes, "that Aristophanes alludes to this custom as bygone,
though the scholiasts do not think so; but its very familiarity to his
audience shows a disregard of human life strange enough in so advanced a
legal system as that of Athens." <span id="fr_550"></span>[3](#fn_550.md)
The fact seems to have been that where criminals were concerned no
notion of humanity or illegality came into play; though in the story of
the sacrifice of the daughter of Aristodemus there is an evident
prevalence of horror at the act. <span id="fr_551"></span>[4](#fn_551.md)
The horror of Themistocles at the demand that he should sacrifice
captives of princely blood at Salamis <span
id="fr_552"></span>[5](#fn_552.md) is really no ground for thinking, as
does Professor Mahaffy, that he or any other Athenian would wince at
putting a criminal to death by religious rites; and such usages, ceasing
to be *called* human sacrifices, may have subsisted long after the
Periclean period. <span id="fr_553"></span>[6](#fn_553.md)

Secondly, there is reason to infer from the uneasy language of
Pausanias <span id="fr_554"></span>[7](#fn_554.md) that human sacrifice to
Lycaean Zeus was still performed in his time during periods of prolonged
drought; and, as we shall see, there are more explicit albeit doubtful
assertions as to its continuance at Rome at a still later period.

Among the barbarians, too, there were cannibal sacraments. Herodotus
tells that his "Androphagoi" were the only people among the Scythians
who ate human flesh; <span id="fr_555"></span>[8](#fn_555.md) but he also
asserts that "when a Scythian overthrows his first enemy he drinks his

<span id="page_128">p. 128</span>

blood"; that when the Scythians make solemn covenants they mix their
blood with wine and drink thereof; <span id="fr_556"></span>[1](#fn_556.md)
that the Massagetæ sacrifice their aged kinsmen and eat their
flesh; <span id="fr_557"></span>[2](#fn_557.md) and that the Issedones eat
the flesh of their dead fathers, mingled with animal flesh, at a grand
banquet. <span id="fr_558"></span>[3](#fn_558.md) Of the "Indian"
Callatians and Padæans he gives similar accounts. <span
id="fr_559"></span>[4](#fn_559.md) From such testimony it appears that an
anthropophagous sacrament could subsist among a people not generally
given to cannibalism; nor does it appear from Herodotus that even the
Androphagoi were at all shunned by other tribes. Substantially following
Herodotus, Pomponius Mela, in the chapter in which he mentions the
Androphagoi and Sacco, tells of some in their region who hold it best to
slay nothing, and of some who, when a near relative is growing weak
through age or sickness, slay him as a sacrifice and hold it *fas et
maxime pium* to eat of their bodies. <span
id="fr_560"></span>[5](#fn_560.md) Pomponius’s geography is certainly of
the wildest; but it is sufficient to note that he locates these
sacramentalists in the region of Nysia, of mount Meros, sacred to Jove,
and of the cave in which was nourished Father Liber. As there is little
doubt that the ancient Akkadians and later Babylonians sacrificed their
first-born children, <span id="fr_561"></span>[6](#fn_561.md) there need be
none as to similar practices among later Asiatic barbarians.

Returning to the civilised pale, we have the terse testimony of Pliny
that among the Druidical rites suppressed by Tiberius had been one in
which *hominem occidere religiosissimum erat, mandi vero etiam
saluberrimum*. <span id="fr_562"></span>[7](#fn_562.md) On this Pliny
declaims, in the imperialistic manner, that *nec satis æstimari potest,
quantum Romanis debeatur* for ending such horrors. Yet we have not only
the record of the early burying alive of four alien men and women in the
Forum Boarium of Rome, 216 B.C.; <span id="fr_563"></span>[8](#fn_563.md)
we have also Pliny's own avowals that only in the year 657 of Rome (97
B.C.) was there passed a senatus-consultus forbidding human
sacrifices; <span id="fr_564"></span>[9](#fn_564.md) and that despite this
there had been seen in his own time (*etiam nostra aetas vidit*) such a
sacrifice, <span id="fr_565"></span>[10](#fn_565.md) in the form of the
burying alive of two aliens of a nation with which Rome was at war. The
law, it appears, referred only to private sacrifices, not to
public. <span id="fr_566"></span>[11](#fn_566.md) It had been even an
established rule that before a battle a dictator or consul or praetor
was entitled to sacrifice any Roman soldier—*quem velit ex legione* 

<span id="page_129">p. 129</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> *Romana scripta
civem devovere*. <span id="fr_567"></span>[1](#fn_567.md) We have also the
innuendoes of Horace <span id="fr_568"></span>[2](#fn_568.md) and
Juvenal <span id="fr_569"></span>[3](#fn_569.md) to the effect that even in
their own day ancient savageries, such as the sacrifice of boys by slow
starvation, could be performed in private, as well as the records of the
sacrifice of two soldiers of Julius Cæsar to Mars, <span
id="fr_570"></span>[4](#fn_570.md) and of the slaying of three hundred of
the enemies of Augustus as a sacrifice to the deified Julius. <span
id="fr_571"></span>[5](#fn_571.md) Lastly, Suetonius explicitly asserts
that the dreadful rites of the Druids, which Pliny declares to have been
abolished by Tiberius, were not put down till the time of Claudius, and
in this connection he adds that only under Augustus were those rites
forbidden to the citizens of Rome. <span id="fr_572"></span>[6](#fn_572.md)
Here, again, the divergence of the testimony tells of indefinite
possibilities of survival for bloody rites, even near the centre of
government. <span id="fr_573"></span>[7](#fn_573.md)

On the general question, for the rest, we have from Porphyry, without
dates, a list of cases of human sacrifices formerly practised by the
Greeks, as in Rhodes, Chios, Tenedos, Salamis, Crete, Athens, and
Sparta, no less than by Egyptians, Arabs, and Phœnicians. <span
id="fr_574"></span>[8](#fn_574.md) And not only Porphyry, but
Eusebius, <span id="fr_575"></span>[9](#fn_575.md) Minucius Felix, <span
id="fr_576"></span>[10](#fn_576.md) and Lactantius <span
id="fr_577"></span>[11](#fn_577.md) speak of the sacrifice of a man to
Latiarian Jove as being still practised in their time; while
Plutarch <span id="fr_578"></span>[12](#fn_578.md) tells of a secret rite,
by implication one of human sacrifice, which he declares to be practised
in the month of November in the Rome of his day. Of the eating of
sacrificed human victims Porphyry mentions no cases among civilised
peoples; and he gives but a loose account of the practice among the
Bassaroi of Thrace, who had imitated it from the Taurians; <span
id="fr_579"></span>[13](#fn_579.md) but Tertullian is again more explicit
and, at the same time, very circumstantial. "At this day," he writes,
"among ourselves (*isthic*) blood consecrated to Bellona, taken in the
palm from a punctured thigh, is given to her sealed ones"—*i.e.*, her
initiates. <span id="fr_580"></span>[14](#fn_580.md) In another passage, he
speaks of a surviving usage of drinking human blood in the

<span id="page_130">p. 130</span>

worship of the Latiarian Jove. <span id="fr_581"></span>[1](#fn_581.md) His
further allusion to the practice of drinking the blood of slain
gladiators as a remedy for epilepsy suggests many further possibilities
of the same kind; and he expressly asserts that the men of his day have
seen a man burnt alive as Hercules. <span
id="fr_582"></span>[2](#fn_582.md)

of as an innovation, and is not further traced; but its toleration
suggests that the Principle had not become obsolete. The story preserved
by Eusebius (*Hist. Eccles.* vii, 10) that Valerian was led by the
"chief of the Egyptian magi" to resort to child sacrifice is clearly a
pious fiction. The story against Nero (Sueton. 36) is more probable.
