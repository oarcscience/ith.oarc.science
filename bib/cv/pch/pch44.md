#### § 17. Further Pagan Adaptations.

One likely result of the non-performance of the mystery-play as such
would be a modification of the sacramental meal. When the crucifixion
was represented in sequel to the supreme annual eucharist,

<span id="page_207">p. 207</span>

the bread and wine of the weekly Supper were somewhat definitely
presented as symbols, whereas the merely priestly representation of the
God by the ministrant in the simple eucharist would emphasise the
declaration "this is my body." As to what may have ritually occurred in
this connection either shortly before or after the period of the
mystery-play we can but speculate, as aforesaid; but we have seen that
the ritual eating of a lamb did take place in the post-Pauline period,
as in the mysteries of Mithra and Dionysos; and there is reason to infer
that for similar reasons there was long and commonly practised among
Christists the usage of eating a baked image of a child at the Easter
communion. <span id="fr_1048"></span>[1](#fn_1048.md) That is the only
satisfactory explanation of the constant pagan charge against the
Christians of eating an actual child—a charge met by the Fathers in
terms which convey that there was *something* to conceal. <span
id="fr_1049"></span>[2](#fn_1049.md) As it was made and repelled long after
the gospels were current with the mystery-play added, there would be no
reason for the attitude of mystery unless the ritual included some
symbolism not described in the books. Given that this symbol was bread
shaped in a human form, Christism was exactly duplicating one of the
practices of the man-sacrificing Mexicans, who at the time of the
Spanish conquest employed such a symbol in some of their sacraments
alongside of still surviving rites of man-eating, and constant human
sacrifice. <span id="fr_1050"></span>[3](#fn_1050.md)

When, however, the Christian cult was officially established, there
needed no such primary symbolism to secure for the habitual sacrament
the reverence of the faithful. The general belief that the sacred bread
became the flesh of the God, and as such had miraculous virtue, could be
maintained on the strength of the bare priestly blessing; and though the
consecrated wafer is itself copied from pagan practice, <span
id="fr_1051"></span>[4](#fn_1051.md) it is finally a symbol of a symbol.
For the same reason the church was able to put down a tendency which can
be traced in the second and third centuries, and even later, to set up a
new sacramental symbol for the Christ—to wit, the Fish. <span
id="fr_1052"></span>[5](#fn_1052.md) This peculiar symbolism was
superficially traced to the fact that the Greek word Ἰχθύς, *Fish*, is
got from the initial letters of the phrase,

<span id="page_208">p. 208</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Ἰησοῦς Χριστὸς
Θεοῦ Ὑιὸς Σωτὴρ—*Jesus Christ, God's Son, Saviour*. But such a solution
is incredible: the anagram is framed after the symbol, not before it;
and the true explanation must be that whereas the divine lamb had long
been identified with the zodiacal sign *Aries*, into which the Sun
enters at the vernal equinox, the time of the crucifixion, the
precession of the equinoxes had for some time made the sun's zodiacal
place at that season not the constellation Aries, but the constellation
*Pisces*. <span id="fr_1053"></span>[1](#fn_1053.md) Either for the same
reason, or in virtue of the simpler myth according to which the Sun was
a fish who every evening plunged in the sea, Horus had long been "the
Fish" in Egypt; and in some planispheres he was represented as
fish-tailed, and holding a cross in his hand. It was he, and not Jesus,
who figured for the Gnostics as the Divine Fish; <span
id="fr_1054"></span>[2](#fn_1054.md) and it was probably through the
Gnostics that the symbol entered the Christian system. And though the
Egyptian precedent was inconvenient, and the symbol recalled both the
Philistine Fish-God Dagon and the Babylonian Oannes, many Christists
would be the more led to such a change of symbol because the lamb symbol
was awkwardly common to both Judaism and Mithraism; and because in
particular the phrase of the Judaistic Apocalypse, "washed in the blood
of the Lamb," pointed very inconveniently to the Mithraic rite of the
*criobolium*, which with the *taurobolium* was a highly popular pagan
rite of "purification." <span id="fr_1055"></span>[3](#fn_1055.md) The
catacomb banquet scenes in which fishes figure as the food <span
id="fr_1056"></span>[4](#fn_1056.md) are probably due to this motive; and
the story of the sacred meal of fish in the fourth gospel was probably
shaped in part under the same pressure, though the idea of a banquet of
seven was also Mithraic. <span id="fr_1057"></span>[5](#fn_1057.md)

A State Church was able to dispense with such tactics, though it saw fit
to discourage the use of the lamb symbol. That, nevertheless, survived
with the equally pagan symbol of the Easter egg, which has no place in
the sacred books, but was taken by the Gnostics from the lore of the
Orphicists. The bread symbol, finally attenuated to the wafer, served as
the supreme or official sanctity. Yet in this remotely symbolical
fashion the historical Church has sedulously preserved the immemorial
principle, common to paganism and Judaism, of a constantly repeated
sacrifice; and by that doctrine the Church of Rome stands to this day,
the Church of England

<span id="page_209">p. 209</span>

leaning strongly towards it. <span id="fr_1058"></span>[1](#fn_1058.md)
Hierologically speaking, they are quite justified; the eucharist is a
sacrificial meal or nothing; and those who recoil from the sacrificial
principle, if they would be equally consistent, have by rights but one
course before them, that of relegating the Christian cultus to the
status of those of paganism.

But in the way of such a course there stands the agelong prepossession
in favour of the Gospel Jesus as a personality and as a teacher. In
these his moral aspects, men think, he stands apart from the Christs,
mythic or otherwise, of the Gentile world, and is worthy of a perpetual
attention. In these aspects, then, finally, must the Christian God-Man
be comparatively studied.

sacramental bread was certainly in round cakes or rolls (Bingham, B. xv,
c. ii, §§ 5, 6), as were the *paniculi* of the pagan sacrifices.
Originally it was taken from the oblations offered by the people, and
was therefore not unleavened. It was only after such oblations had
practically ceased that the Church began to supply the sacred bread in
the form of wafers, for economy's sake, and, these being necessarily
unleavened, argued that they ought to be so.
