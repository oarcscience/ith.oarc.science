#### § 3. The Christian Crucifixion.

To those who have not realised how all religion has been evolved from
savage beginnings, it will seem extravagant to suggest that the story of
the Christian crucifixion has been built up from a practice such as
those above described. And yet the grounds for inferring such a
derivation are extremely strong. Some doubt has been cast, not quite
unjustly, upon such inferences in general, as a result of criticism of
Dr. Frazer's ingenious guess that the gospel crucifixion incidentally
reproduced the features of the sacrifice of a mock-king in the
Perso-Babylonian feast of the Sacæa. The vital difficulty of such a
theory is that it takes the gospel episode as historical on the strength
of detailed narratives which—save in the episode of Barabbas, whereby
the main history is undermined—give no hint of such a coincidence as is
surmised, and which, if true narratives, could not conceivably omit to
record it had it occurred.

But scientific hierology is not held down to that theory, which, in any
case, seeks to account only for certain features of the crucifixion
story, notably the mock-crowning and the scourging. These features are
indeed probably to be explained through the analogies to which Dr.
Frazer points, though not on his assumption of a historical episode; but
there are other features, such as the cross itself, and the
resurrection, to which the clues lie, unemphasised, in other sections of
Dr. Frazer's survey; and there are yet others which he has not
ostensibly studied. Some of these are illuminated by the rite of human
sacrifice among the Khonds. Their placing of the victim, for instance,
either on a cross or in a cleft bough in such a way as to make a living
cross, <span id="fr_478"></span>[3](#fn_478.md) wherein the God is as it
were part of the living tree, is a singularly suggestive parallel. But
no

<span id="page_119">p. 119</span>

less so is the detail as to the breaking of the victim's arms and legs,
to make him seem unresisting, and the substitution of opium as being
less cruel.

This last principle is found to have been acted on by the Karhâda
Brahmans of Bombay. In their secret human sacrifice, described by Sir
John Malcolm, the unsuspecting victim—often a stranger long hospitably
entertained for the purpose—was drugged; and in his drugged state was
led three times round the idol of the Goddess, whereafter his throat was
cut. <span id="fr_479"></span>[1](#fn_479.md) Yet again, the same principle
is found so far away as Mexico, where, in one annual sacrifice to the
Fire-God, the victims were painted red like the Khond *meriah*, and a
narcotic powder was thrown in their faces. They too were subjected to
special suffering, being thrown into the fire before being sacrificed
with the knife in the usual way. <span id="fr_480"></span>[2](#fn_480.md)
And in the Mexican sacrifice, also, the God was expressly represented by
a tree, stripped of bark and branches, but covered with painted paper.

Let us now take the Christian parallels.

In the fourth gospel it is told that after the death of Jesus on the
cross, in order "that the bodies might not stay on the cross on the
Sabbath," the Jews "asked of Pilate that their legs might be broken and
they might be taken away." But the soldiers broke only the legs of the
"two others," these not being yet dead: Jesus they spared, piercing his
heart with a lance, "that the scripture might be fulfilled: A bone of
him shall not be broken." The other gospels say nothing on this point;
but all four tell of the offering of a drink, and the first two
synoptics mention it both before and after the act of crucifying. In
Matthew, "vinegar mixed with gall" is offered beforehand, and refused
after tasting; and a sponge of vinegar is offered, apparently in
sympathy, after the cry of Eli, Eli. In the first passage the text has
evidently been tampered with; for the Vulgate and Ethiopic versions, the
Sinaitic, Vatican, and Bezan codices, and many old MSS., read *wine* for
vinegar, while the Arabic version reads *myrrh* for *gall*. <span
id="fr_481"></span>[3](#fn_481.md) In Mark, more significantly, the first
drink becomes "wine spiced with myrrh," and is refused without tasting;
and here the commentators recognise that the purpose was presumably to
cause stupefaction, and so lighten the suffering. <span
id="fr_482"></span>[4](#fn_482.md) In

<span id="page_120">p. 120</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Luke, this detail
entirely disappears, and the vinegar offered on the cross is given in
mockery. In John also, only the drink offered on the cross is mentioned;
and of this it is said that "When Jesus had received the vinegar he
said, It is finished." Then follows the detail as to the breaking of the
legs.

It is needless here to challenge afresh the historical value of the
conflicting records, wherein a slight detail, of no historical
importance, enters only to take varying forms for symbolical reasons.
What we are concerned with is the source of the symbolism. One compiler
clearly knows of a drink offered before the crucifixion, and implies
that it was intended to cause euthanasia, for he notes that it was
refused. The divine victim must be a conscious sufferer. A later
compiler ignores altogether this detail, and notes only that the slayers
tormented the victim with a drink of vinegar. Both details alike are
un-Roman, <span id="fr_483"></span>[1](#fn_483.md) for the torment was
trivial, while the narcotic would be inconsistent with what was meant to
be an exemplary punishment. The theologising fourth gospel, in turn,
makes the victim accept the drink of vinegar as the last symbolic act of
sufferance; <span id="fr_484"></span>[2](#fn_484.md) but then suddenly
alludes to a detail not specified by the others—a *concluding* act of
limb-breaking, from which the divine victim escapes for dogmatic
reasons, the fact of his death being made certain by a lance-thrust in
the side. We must infer that the limb-breaking was *known to occur* in
certain circumstances, and that the writer or an interpolator of the
fourth gospel saw need to make it clear that the bones of the Messiah
remained unbroken. He being, according to the fourth gospel, the true
paschal sacrifice, it was important that the law as to the Passover
should in him be fulfilled. <span id="fr_485"></span>[3](#fn_485.md)

On what data, then, did the different evangelists proceed? What had they
under notice? Not an original narrative: their dissidence is almost
complete. Not a known official practice in Roman crucifixions; for the
third gospel treats as an act of mockery what the first and second do
not so regard; and the fourth describes the act of limb-breaking as done
to meet a Jewish demand, which in

<span id="page_121">p. 121</span>

the synoptic narrative could not arise. Mere breaking of the legs,
besides, would be at once a laborious and an inadequate way of making
sure that the victims were dead; <span id="fr_486"></span>[1](#fn_486.md)
the spear-thrust would be the natural and the sufficient act; yet only
one victim is speared. Only one hypothesis will meet the whole case. The
different narratives testify to the existence of a *ritual* or *rituals*
of crucifixion or quasi-crucifixion, in variants of which there had
figured the two procedures of breaking the legs of the victim and giving
him a narcotic. Of these procedures neither is understood by the
evangelists, though by some of them the latter is partly comprehended;
and they accordingly proceed to turn both, in different fashions, to
dogmatic account. Their conflict is thus insoluble, and their testimony
alike unhistorical. But we find the psychological clue in the hypothesis
of a known ritual of a crucified Saviour-God, who had for
universally-recognised reasons to appear to suffer as a willing
victim. <span id="fr_487"></span>[2](#fn_487.md) Being crucified—that is,
hung by the hands or wrists to a tree or post, and supported not by his
feet but by a bar between his thighs—he would tend to struggle (unlike
the Khond victim, whose arms were free) chiefly with his legs; and if he
were to be prevented from struggling, it would have to be either by
breaking the legs or by stupefying him with a drug. The Khonds, we have
seen, used anciently the former horrible method, but learned to use the
latter also. Finally, the detail of the spear-thrust in the side,
bestowed only on the ostensibly divine victim, suggests that in some
similar ritual that may have been the mode of ceremonial slaying. We
have but to recognise that among some of the more civilised peoples of
the Mediterranean similar processes had been sometimes gone through
about two thousand years ago, and we have the conditions which may
account for the varying gospel narratives.

And if there had occurred in the Mediterranean world such an evolution
as we see among the Khonds and elsewhere, we have in the story of the
betrayal by Judas, incredible and unintelligible as the narratives
stand, one more item of sacrificial practice. The Pauline phrase "bought
with a price" (1 Cor. vi, 20) ostensibly conveys the meaning of
"ransomed," and is not applied to Jesus. But the paying of a price to
Judas by the high-priests would become quite intelligible as one more
detail in a mystery-drama

<span id="page_122">p. 122</span>

growing out of a ritual of human sacrifice. "Judas" in any case is
presumably only a development from *Joudaios*, a Jew; <span
id="fr_488"></span>[1](#fn_488.md) and the basis of the episode, thus
understood, would be the Gentile imputation on the Jews of having sold
the Lord as a human sacrifice. And the doctrine put in the mouth of
Caiaphas in the fourth gospel (xi, 50-51) is a doctrine of human
sacrifice.

<span id="fn_478"></span>[118:3](pch30.htm#fr_478.md) This detail is
observed in a surrogate sacrifice of a pig in Polynesia, and in
sacrifices of goats and human beings in Nigeria. See below, § 8.

Exposition on Mt. xxvii, 34.

<span id="fn_482"></span>[119:4](pch30.htm#fr_482.md) According to several
Talmudic passages, the Jews gave to any man about to be executed "a
grain of frankincense in a cup of wine," and the tradition runs that the
ladies of Jerusalem gave this to the doomed ones. Gill's Expos. on Mk.
xv, 23, citing T. Bab. Sanhedrin, fol. 43, 1 ; Bemdbar Rabba, sect. 10,
fol. 198, 4, etc. Cp. Hershon, *Genesis with a Talmudical Commentary*,
1883, p. 150 note 10. But if this were so, the practice was <span
id="page_120">p. 120</span> *extended to executions from sacrifices*. It
cannot have originated as an amelioration of a punishment of which the
first purpose was to cause suffering. In any case, there is no
suggestion that any drink was offered to the two thieves: here we are
dealing with a sacrificial ritual in which only the central victim is a
true sacrifice. See below, § 9.

<span id="fn_483"></span>[120:1](pch30.htm#fr_483.md) Josephus indeed tells
(*Wars*, V, 11, § 1) that during the siege of Jerusalem the Romans
crucified vast multitudes of the Jews who sought to escape, first
scourging them, and then torturing them in different ways; but this is
expressly declared to be an act at once of military vengeance and of
terrorism, whereas the drink of vinegar was either a mere trifling
insult or an act of relief.

<span id="fn_484"></span>[120:2](pch30.htm#fr_484.md) Psalm lxix, 21, would
lead Judaists ignorant of old Jewish usage so to regard such a draught.

<span id="fn_485"></span>[120:3](pch30.htm#fr_485.md) Exodus xii, 46; Num.
ix, 12 (cp. Ps. xxxiv, 20, where "the righteous" would be held to apply
to the Messiah). This very law points to memories of the act of
limb-breaking in sacrifice.

<span id="fn_486"></span>[121:1](pch30.htm#fr_486.md) The statement of
Lactantius (*Div. Inst.* iv, 26) that it was usual for the executioners
to break the bones of those crucified is without foundation, and is
confuted by the absence of the detail from the synoptics. The
*crurifragium*, or punishment by limb-breaking, was quite a different
thing.

victims are required to be of a willing mind." Tertullian, *Ad
Scapulam*, 2. Cp. Macrobius, *Sat*. iii, 5; Lucan, *Pharsalia*, i, 611.
