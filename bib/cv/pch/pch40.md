#### § 13. Special Features of the Crucifixion Myth.

Of the evolution of the Jewish religion between the closing of the
Hebrew canon and the rise of Jesuism we know, broadly, that it consisted
in (1) the establishment of the doctrine of a future life, in despite of
its complete absence from the Mosaic law; (2) the development of the
belief in a Messiah who should either restore the temporal power of
Jewry or bring in a new religious world; (3) the growth of the idea of
an only-begotten Son of God, otherwise the Word, who is alternately the
nation of Israel and a God who represents it; <span
id="fr_929"></span>[4](#fn_929) and (4.md) the growth of independent sects
or movements, such as that of the Essenes. Of the historical
circumstances we know more. They included, as we have seen, a recurrent
paganisation of portions

<span id="page_181">p. 181</span>

of the priesthood; an interlude of absolute pagan domination; and
finally, after a period of triumph for the traditional faith, the advent
of an Idumean dynasty, far from zealous for orthodox Judaism.

During centuries of this evolution, the Jewish people tasted many times
the bitterness of despair, the profound doubt denounced by the last of
the prophets; and in periods in which many went openly over to Hellenism
it could not be but that ancient rites of the Semitic race were revived,
as some are declared to have been in earlier times of trouble. Among the
rites of expiation and propitiation, as we have seen, none stood
traditionally higher than the sacrifice of a king or a king's son; and
such an act the Jews saw as it were performed for them when the Romans
under Antony, at Herod's wish, scourged, crucified \[lit. "bound to a
stake"\], and beheaded Antigonus, the last of the Asmonean priest-kings,
in the year 37 B.C. <span id="fr_930"></span>[1](#fn_930.md) In a reign in
which two king's sons were slain by their own father, the idea would not
disappear; but in so far as it held its ground as a religious doctrine
it would in all likelihood do so by being reduced to ritual form, like
the leading worships of the surrounding Gentile world. In the case of
nearly every God who mythically died and rose again—as Osiris, Dionysos,
Attis, Adonis, and Mithra—the creed of the God's power to give immortal
life was maintained by a ritual sacrament, generally developed into a
mystery-drama. Such a mystery-drama, however, would be at bottom a
perpetuation of the latest form of the primitive rite as it had been
publicly performed; and as we have seen in the gospel myth the clear
trace of the ancient usage of disabling or drugging the victim to make
him seem a willing sufferer, so we may infer from it that the latest
public form of the human sacrifice in some Syrian communities was the
sacrificing of *three* criminals together.

Of a sacrifice of this special number the explanation may very well be
the great and then growing vogue of the number three in eastern
mysticism. Among the Dravidians of India we have seen three victims
sacrificed to the Sun-God. <span id="fr_931"></span>[2](#fn_931.md) In the
legendary sacrifice of Saul's sons there figured the sacred and
planetary number seven, which appears also in the special "restoration
feast" of the Hervey and other South Sea Islanders; <span
id="fr_932"></span>[3](#fn_932.md) in the legendary sacrifice of the kings
by Joshua we have the older planetary number, five; and in

<span id="page_182">p. 182</span>

western as in eastern Asia the number three might naturally have its
votaries, in respect of trinitarian concepts as well as of the primary
notion of "the heavens, the earth, and the underworld," with their
respective Gods. <span id="fr_933"></span>[1](#fn_933.md) There is even a
hint of such possible developments in the single sacrifice of the Khonds
to the Earth-Goddess, wherein the victim was kept for three days bound
to a post which was often placed between two shrubs, before being
finally sacrificed at a post around which were usually set up four
larger posts. <span id="fr_934"></span>[2](#fn_934.md) But there is an
explanation lying in the nature and purpose of the sacrifice, which was
probably the determining cause of the detail in the Syrian rite.

The tradition, we have seen, called for a king or a king's son; but a
victim of royal blood was normally out of the question; and whether by
consent of latitudinarian kings or high-priests, or by way of simple
popular licence, the natural evolution would be that which took place in
a similar connection elsewhere—the sacrificing of condemned criminals in
the capacity of kings or kings’ first-born sons. But, as has been
already remarked, though this substitution was quite acceptable to the
average mind, there was something repugnant to the higher doctrine of
sacrifice in the selection of a criminal, who was morally the analogue
of the blemished animal, rejected by nearly all sacrificial rituals. How
then could the compulsion of such a choice be best reconciled with the
purpose and spirit of the rite? By a device framed in the spirit of
"sympathetic magic," which was in fact the spirit of all such rites. The
sacrificers could by their ritual of mock-crowning and robing
distinguish one of the malefactors from his fellows; and by calling the
others what they were, while he was paraded as king, they would attain
the semblance of a truly august sacrifice. If in any Jewish community,
or in the Jewish quarter of any eastern city, the central figure in this
rite were customarily called Jesus Barabbas, "Jesus the Son of the
Father"—whether or not in virtue of an old cultus of a God Jesus who had
died annually like Attis and Tammuz—we should have the basis for the
tradition so long preserved in many MSS. of the first gospel, and at the
same time a basis for the whole gospel myth of the crucifixion. And when
we remember how the common attitude towards criminals permitted the
strange survival of human sacrifice in the Thargelia at Athens, we can
hardly doubt that

<span id="page_183">p. 183</span>

eastern cities could on the same pretext be as conservative of ancient
usage.

That such a victim should be at times chosen and freed in advance, and
permitted a measure of sexual licence as well as a semblance of royal
state, is quite conceivable. The usage of a year's dedication or respite
seems to have been general in connection with such sacrifices, alike
among Asiatics, Greeks, Polynesians, Mexicans, and American aborigines;
we have seen it among Strabo's Albanians; and there are clear traces of
it among the Arabs just before the time of Mohammed. <span
id="fr_935"></span>[1](#fn_935.md) At an early stage of civilisation,
indulgence to a victim so situated would on many grounds be a matter of
course. As we saw, indeed, Japan could secure annual victims who
throughout their year of duty seem to have practised rigid abstinence,
as the non-sacrificed official does to-day; but in general such altruism
must have been hard to secure. In the triennial sacrifice of a beautiful
girl at Bonny to the Sea-God, the victim had her every wish fulfilled,
and everything she touched became her property; <span
id="fr_936"></span>[2](#fn_936.md) and among the Native Americans a captive
slain to appease the spirit of a slain man of the tribe had given to him
the wives or sisters of the dead man, with whom he was allowed to live
for a time. Then came a sacrificial banquet, after which he was put in
durance and at length ritually slain <span
id="fr_937"></span>[3](#fn_937.md) and eaten. <span
id="fr_938"></span>[4](#fn_938.md)

Perhaps the most suggestive instance of all is that of the
*Asvamedha* <span id="fr_939"></span>[5](#fn_939.md) or horse-sacrifice
among the ancient Hindus. <span id="fr_940"></span>[6](#fn_940.md)
Concerning this the doctrine runs that kings who received from a Brahman
a certain special anointing and "made the sacrifice of the horse" were
thereby enabled to attain boundless conquests. <span
id="fr_941"></span>[7](#fn_941.md) With regard to the horse so sacrificed
it was stipulated in the ritual that during an entire year beforehand it
must be left free to wander at

<span id="page_184">p. 184</span>

its will, carefully protected the while by guards set to the task. <span
id="fr_942"></span>[1](#fn_942.md) As this horse is further clearly
identified with the sun, <span id="fr_943"></span>[2](#fn_943.md) there can
be little doubt that it was a substitute or equivalent for a more
ancient human sacrifice to the Sun-God, and was on that account regarded
as of overwhelming efficacy. <span id="fr_944"></span>[3](#fn_944.md) Until
the present century, among the Aryan Kafirs of the Hindu-Kush, a
sacrifice of a horse was reckoned to have abnormal virtue, one being
"occasionally, not more than once in many years," sacrificed at a
certain sacred pit near the temple of Imra at the sacred village of
Kstigigrom, in Presungul. <span id="fr_945"></span>[4](#fn_945.md) So
deeply fixed was the idea that among the Bataks of Sumatra, who were for
a time influenced by the Hindus, the white horse is still a special
offering to the higher God or Gods, though it is now as a rule devoted
without being slain. In the latter case it remains permanently holy and
inviolable; <span id="fr_946"></span>[5](#fn_946.md) and among the Siberian
Yakuts, who latterly are recorded to have consecrated a stallion every
year, the animal, though not sacrificed, henceforth does no more
work. <span id="fr_947"></span>[6](#fn_947.md) The horse, we may note in
passing, may have been in this case a totem animal. Among the negroes of
Nigeria at the present day, however, not only the bullocks specially set
apart for sacrifice to the governing God, but cattle in general,
including sheep and goats, are treated as if sacred, and the males are
eaten only at religious ceremonials. <span
id="fr_948"></span>[7](#fn_948.md) The totemistic hypothesis, therefore, is
not necessary to the argument, the divinity of the victim as such being
clear in any case. And sacredness in animals is not restricted to
victims. In Southern India, in some parts of Ganjam, large numbers of
Brāhmini bulls are treated as sacred; and castes which do not copy them
in giving sacred burial to a bull often set free sacred cows or calves.
Among the Adivi or forest Gollas, again, "the people of every house in
the village let loose a sheep, to wander whither it will, as a sort of
perpetual scapegoat"; and among the Badagas a scape-calf is let loose at
every funeral, to bear the sins of the deceased. Henceforth it is free,
like the animals otherwise "sacred." <span
id="fr_949"></span>[8](#fn_949.md)

We are now prepared to understand that the freedom permitted to the
Babylonian mock-king before the Sacæa originated, not, as

<span id="page_185">p. 185</span>

has been suggested, <span id="fr_950"></span>[1](#fn_950.md) by way of
making the mock-king commit the act of technical high treason, entering
the harem, but as a result of the contingent divinity of the victim in
the primitive cult. The formal trial of a victim may be otherwise
explained, as a primitive process of degrading a discredited
priest-king. <span id="fr_951"></span>[2](#fn_951.md) In the case of the
Khonds, who had no harlots <span id="fr_952"></span>[3](#fn_952.md) and few
concubines, intercourse on the part of a destined male victim with
either the wives or the daughters of the inhabitants was welcomed as a
high boon, <span id="fr_953"></span>[4](#fn_953.md) though he often had
allotted to him a victim wife; and the same idea seems to have underlain
the treatment of the doomed God-man in ancient Mexico. <span
id="fr_954"></span>[5](#fn_954.md) A study of these cases will suggest that
in a primitive tribal state, when annual voluntary victims were
otherwise hard to get, men may very well have been got to accept the
*rôle* on condition of a year's quasi-regal licence. Savages notoriously
set present pleasure far before future pain in their thought. And out of
such a *religious* kingship may have *separately* arisen both the
function of the priest-king as seen in Greece and Rome, and the
phenomenon of the mock-king of the Sacæa. On this view the improbability
of the annual slaying of the acting king, urged by Mr. Lang <span
id="fr_955"></span>[6](#fn_955.md) against Dr. Frazer, does not arise;
while the theory fundamentally stands. What is certain is that no
principle of indulgence could have been accepted in the Christian
legend, arising as it did in a cultus of asceticism. But in the
character of the Messiah as one who associated with publicans and
sinners; in his association with women; and in the obstinate legend
which, apart from the text, made Mary Magdalene—a visibly mythical
character <span id="fr_956"></span>[7](#fn_956.md)—figure as a former
harlot, we may have another such survival as has been surmised to
underlie the tradition of "Jesus Barabbas"; and the common belief of the
early Church that the ministry of Jesus lasted for only one year <span
id="fr_957"></span>[8](#fn_957.md) may have a similar basis in the old
usage. Further, as Dr. Frazer has suggested, the story of the triumphal
entry into Jerusalem may preserve a tradition of a mock-royal procession
for the destined victim. Even the legend of the riding on two asses,
which, as has been elsewhere shown, <span
id="fr_958"></span>[9](#fn_958.md) preserves an ancient zodiacal symbol,
and at the same time a myth concerning Dionysos, might have anciently
figured in the procession of a God-victim of the Dionysiak type. As the
zodiacal symbol stands for

<span id="page_186">p. 186</span>

the autumn equinox, and the crucifixion is placed at the spring-equinox,
these details would be chronologically separate; but Tammuz, like
Dionysos, seems to have had two feasts; <span
id="fr_959"></span>[1](#fn_959.md) and in any case the legend was free to
include different ritual episodes. Finally, the explanation of the
ascription of the title of "Nazarite" to Jesus—a perplexing detail which
led the redactors to frame the myth of his birth at Nazareth <span
id="fr_960"></span>[2](#fn_960.md)—may be that the Jewish victim, like the
Khond, wore his hair unshorn. It would be natural that he should; the
institution of the *nazir*, a word which means "dedicated," being an
inheritance from the ancient times of common human sacrifice, and being
associated with the myth of Samson, in which the shorn Sun-God is as it
were sacrificed to himself.

We have now followed our historic clues far enough to warrant a
constructive theory. Indeed, it frames itself when we colligate our main
data. As thus:—

1\. In the slaying of the Kronian victim at Rhodes we have an ancient
Semitic <span id="fr_961"></span>[3](#fn_961.md) human sacrifice maintained
into the historic period, by the expedient of taking as annual victim a
criminal already condemned to death.

2\. In Semitic mythology, Kronos, "whom the Phœnicians call Israel,"
sacrifices his son Ieoud, "the only," after putting upon him royal
robes.

3\. The feast of Kronos is the Saturnalia, in which elsewhere a
mock-king plays a prominent part; and as Kronos was among the Semites
identified with Moloch = "King," <span id="fr_962"></span>[4](#fn_962.md)
the victim would be ostensibly either a king or a king's son. A trial
and degradation were likely accessories.

4\. Supposing the victim in the Rhodian Saturnalia to figure as Ieoud,
he would be *ipso facto* Barabbas, "the son of the father"; and in the
terms of the case he was a condemned criminal. At the same time, in
terms of the myth, he would figure in royal robes.

5\. In any case, the myth being Semitic, it is morally certain that
among the many cases of human sacrifice in the Græco-Semitic world the
Rhodian rite was not unique. And as the name "Ieoud," besides signifying
"the only," was virtually identical with the Greek and Hebrew names for
Judah (son of "Israel") and Jew (*Yehuda*,

<span id="page_187">p. 187</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> *Ioudaios*), it
was extremely likely, among the Jews of the Dispersion, to be regarded
as having special application to their race, which in their sacred books
actually figured as the Only-Begotten Son of the Father-God, and as
having undergone special suffering.

6\. That the Rhodian rite, Semitic in origin, was at some points
specially coincident with Jewish conceptions of sacrifice, is proved by
the detail of leading the prisoner outside the city gates. This is
expressly laid down in the Epistle to the Hebrews, <span
id="fr_963"></span>[1](#fn_963.md) as a ritual condition of the sacrificial
death of Jesus.

The case, of course, is not staked on any assumption that the Rhodian
rite was the exact historical antecedent of the Jesuist rite as
preserved in the gospels. That the Jews had much traffic with Rhodes
maybe gathered from Josephus’s account of Herod's relations with the
place; <span id="fr_964"></span>[2](#fn_964.md) but we are not committed to
the view that the Jews had any hand in the Rhodian sacrifice ritual, or
that the gospel myth followed that. So far as the records go, the
coincidence is incomplete, since (1) the Rhodian Saturnalia was a June
or July festival, and thus disparate from the Passover; and (2) there is
no hint of a triple execution. But it suffices, firstly, that we have
here a clear case of a variant from a type to which the Christian
crucifixion-ritual belongs; and, secondly, that the Rhodian rite further
points to the decisive development which we have yet to trace in the
case of the gospel story. For Porphyry incidentally mentions that the
Rhodian sacrifice, after having subsisted long, had latterly been
modified (μετέβληθη). As to the precise nature of the modification we
have no further knowledge; but we are entitled to conclude that it was
*either a simple rite of mock-sacrifice or a mystery-drama*. Both
stages, indeed, would be natural, the step to the latter being dependent
on the connection of the rite with a eucharist. But the essential point
is that in this case—the memory of which is preserved, like so many
items in our knowledge of ancient life, by an incidental sentence in a
treatise to which the subject was barely relevant—we have exactly the
kind of transition from actual human sacrifice to a conventional rite of
mock-sacrifice which our theory implies. And seeing that the actual
sacrifice was once normal in the Semitic world, there can be little
doubt that the cases and modes of modification were many.

Meantime, the bearing of such a development on our total problem is
obvious. We have traced on the one hand a Semitic and probably
Israelitish tradition of an annually (or periodically) sacrificed

<span id="page_188">p. 188</span>

victim, "Jesus the Son of the Father," and seen reason to surmise the
contact of dispersed Jews with such a rite in Hellenistic eastern towns.
On the other hand we have traced a Jewish bread-and-wine eucharist,
which we find emerging in documentary knowledge in the pre-Christian
eucharist of the "Teaching of the Twelve Apostles," with the name of
Jesus attached to a strictly Judaic personage of quasi-divine status,
not said to be crucified or otherwise sacrificed. Of these forms of
doctrine and rite there took place a fusion, forming the historic
Christian cultus. Of such a fusion, the most likely and most
intelligible means would be the mystery-drama, whose existence has now
to be demonstrated. But first we have to note certain historic
possibilities on which the fusion might partly depend.
