#### § 10. Further Christian Parallels.

Still further does the parallel hold. It is well known that whereas in
the gospels Jesus is said to have been born in an inn

<span id="page_321">p. 321</span>

stable, early Christian writers, as Justin Martyr <span
id="fr_1657"></span>[1](#fn_1657.md) and Origen, <span
id="fr_1658"></span>[2](#fn_1658.md) explicitly say he was born in a cave.
Now, in the Mithra myth, Mithra is both rock-born and born in a cave;
and the monuments show the new-born babe adored by shepherds who offer
first-fruits. <span id="fr_1659"></span>[3](#fn_1659.md) And it is
remarkable that whereas a cave long was (and I believe is) shown as the
birthplace of Jesus at Bethlehem, Saint Jerome actually complained <span
id="fr_1660"></span>[4](#fn_1660.md) that in his day the Pagans celebrated
the worship of Tammuz (= Adonis), and presumably, therefore, the
festival of the birth of the sun, Christmas Day, at that very cave.

Given these identities, it was inevitable that, whether or not Mithra
was originally, or in the older Mazdean creed, regarded as born of a
Virgin, he should in his western cultus come to be so regarded. <span
id="fr_1661"></span>[5](#fn_1661.md) As we saw, there was a primary
tendency, Aryan as well as Semitic, to make the young God the son of the
Supreme God, like Dionysos, like Apollo, like Herakles; and when Mithra
became specially identified, like Dionysos, with the Phrygian God
Sabazios, <span id="fr_1662"></span>[6](#fn_1662.md) who was the "child as
it were of the \[great\] Mother," <span
id="fr_1663"></span>[7](#fn_1663.md) he necessarily came to hold the same
relation to the Mother-Goddess. <span id="fr_1664"></span>[8](#fn_1664.md)
But in all likelihood there were ancient Persian forms of the conception
to start from. It seems highly probable that the birth-legend of the
Persian Cyrus <span id="fr_1665"></span>[9](#fn_1665.md) was akin to or
connected with the myth of Mithra, <span
id="fr_1666"></span>[10](#fn_1666) Cyrus (Koresh.md) being a name of the
sun, <span id="fr_1667"></span>[11](#fn_1667.md) and the legend being
obviously solar. Thus it would tend to be told of Mithra that he was
born under difficulties, like the other Sun-Gods; <span
id="fr_1668"></span>[12](#fn_1668.md) and his being cave-born would make it
the more easy.

It was further practically a matter of course that his mother should be
styled Virgin, the precedents being uniform. <span
id="fr_1669"></span>[13](#fn_1669.md) In Phrygia the God Acdestis or
Agdistis, a variant of Attis, associated with Attis and Mithra in the
worship of the Great Mother, is rock-born; <span
id="fr_1670"></span>[14](#fn_1670.md) like

<span id="page_322">p. 322</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Mithra he is
twy-sexed, figuring in some versions as a female; and the coarse Greek
story of the manner of his birth is evidently a myth framed to account
for an epithet. Further, the Goddess Anahita or Anaitis, with whom
Mithra was anciently paired, was preeminently a Goddess of fruitfulness
and nutriency, <span id="fr_1671"></span>[1](#fn_1671.md) and as such would
necessarily figure in her cultus as a Mother; and as Mithra never
appears (save in worshipful metaphor) as a father, he would perforce
rank as her son. Precisely so does Attis in the Orphic theosophy figure
as the son of Athênê, the Virgin Goddess, <span
id="fr_1672"></span>[2](#fn_1672.md) who in turn is possibly a variant of
Anaitis and Tanith <span id="fr_1673"></span>[3](#fn_1673.md) Finally, as
the preeminent spirit Sraosha (= Vohumano) was connected with
Mithra, <span id="fr_1674"></span>[4](#fn_1674.md) so would there be a
blending or assimilation of Mithra with Saoshyas or Saoshyant, the
Saviour and Raiser of the Dead, who in the Parsee mythology is to be
virgin-born, his mother miraculously conceiving him from the seed of
Zarathustra. <span id="fr_1675"></span>[5](#fn_1675.md)

As a result of all these myth-motives, we find Mithra figuring in the
Christian empire in the fourth and fifth centuries, alongside of the
Christ, as supernaturally born of a Virgin-Mother—a mortal maiden or a,
Mother-Goddess—and of the Most High God; <span
id="fr_1676"></span>[6](#fn_1676.md) and if the Christians made much of
some occult thesis that Mithra was his own father, or otherwise the
spouse of his mother, they were but keeping record of the fact that in
this as in so many ancient cults, and more obscurely in their own, the
God had been variously conceived as the Son and as the lover of the
Mother-Goddess. <span id="fr_1677"></span>[7](#fn_1677.md) In all
probability they took from, or adopted in emulation of, Mithraism the
immemorial ritual of the birth of the Child-God; for in the Mithraic
monuments we have the figure of the tree overshadowing the new-born
child <span id="fr_1678"></span>[8](#fn_1678.md) even as it does in the
early Christian sculptures. <span id="fr_1679"></span>[9](#fn_1679.md)

<span id="page_323">p. 323</span>

So long as Mithraism was allowed to subsist, the competition continued.
Even as Jesus in the historic creed makes the Descent to Hades, like so
many elder Gods, so in the ancient Persian system Mithra was slain and
passed to the under-world, this at the time of the autumnal equinox,
when the sun enters Libra, the current month bearing Mithra's name
(Mihr). The evidence for the myth is peculiarly interesting, inasmuch as
it is embodied in a tradition and a custom which have locally survived
even the knowledge that there ever was such a deity. It is a Christian
archæologist who writes that "Mihrgàn (or Mihrjàn) is the name of the
sixteenth day of any month, and is the name of the seventh month of the
solar year; and during its continuance the sun which enlightens the
world is in the sign of Libra, which is the beginning of the autumnal
season, and with the Persians ranks next in honour to the feast and
holiday of the Nùrùz." <span id="fr_1680"></span>[1](#fn_1680.md) Here,
too, <span id="fr_1681"></span>[2](#fn_1681.md) the public day is at the
beginning and the courtiers’ day at the end of a festival week. In the
late legend, Mithra being lost sight of, the autumnal festival was
explained by a story that "the Persians had a king of the name of Mihr,
who was a very great tyrant, and that in the middle of the month he
*arrived at the regions of torment*, for which reason they gave the name
of Mihrgàn, which signifies the death of a tyrannical king; for Mihr has
been allowed to mean *to die*, and Gàn, a tyrannical king." <span
id="fr_1682"></span>[3](#fn_1682.md) The etymology is of course nonsense,
Mihr being simply, as we have seen, the true Persian form of the
God-name Mithra, after whom was named the seventh month of the solar
year. And the clear inference is that in the old myth the God went to
the underworld at the proper solar date, the autumnal equinox, perhaps
to "rise again," fittingly, at the vernal equinox.

Here we should have the proper pair of solar dates, which in the
Christian cult are combined by making the God die and rise again at the
spring equinox in the manner of Attis and Adonis and the other Gods of
Vegetation; though on the other hand Jesus is tempted as the Sun-God by
the Goat-God at the beginning of his career (Sun in Capricorn), and
rides on two asses like Dionysos at the beginning of his decline (Sun in
Cancer). <span id="fr_1683"></span>[4](#fn_1683.md) In the Roman Calendar
we find still

<span id="page_324">p. 324</span>

further traces of the old doubling in the setting of the Festival of the
Transfiguration and the *Festum Nominis Jesu* on August 6th and 7th, and
of the Assumption of Mary on August 15th; while the day of the
*Exaltatio Sacræ Crucis* is September 14th, and that of St. Michael, the
conqueror of the dragon of Hades, is September 29th. When we remember
that the myth of the descent of Apollo to Hades was in time completely
lost sight of by the Greeks, to the extent even of their forgetting that
Admetus had been a name of Hades, <span
id="fr_1684"></span>[1](#fn_1684.md) we can readily understand the similar
process in the case of Mithra. <span id="fr_1685"></span>[2](#fn_1685.md)

plausibility to the view (rejected, however, by M. Cumont) that the
presence of "the priest Mithras" in Apuleius’ account of the mysteries
of Isis (*Metamorphoses*, B. xi) implies a similar joining of the
Mithraic and Isiac cults.

pp. 61, 62, and by Cumont, ii, 5, from Langlois’ trad. of the *History
of Vartan*, ii, 193). That "the God Mihrvard was born of a woman" was
asserted by the Christian bishops in reply to Zoroastrian priests; and
again, "One of your wisest men said that the God Mihr was born of a
mortal mother." They do not say she was married. Others fabled that
Mithra was born "of the incestuous intercourse of Ahura Mazda with his
own mother" (Cumont, as cited; also i, 161). Whatever were the earlier
myths, Mithra in the fourth, fifth, and sixth centuries "was held \[in
Armenia\] to be one and the same person with Christ, and whatever the
evangelists relate of Christ was transferred to him" (Note by Neumann,
as cited. p. 89),

Osiris, and Horos, and the problem of the two mourning Maries in the

Tezcatlipoca, son of the Virgin Goddess Coatlicue.

and Mythology*, 2nd ed. pp. 188, 201-2, as to the presence of this
myth-motive in other cults. The reason for surmising that Mithraism was
the point of contact for the Christists is the Persian aspect of the
figures and names of the *Magi*. Even the <span id="page_323">p.
323</span> "stable" myth has a curious connection with Mithraism. See
the Greek formula in Firmicus (c. v (iv)—passage corrupt): "The sacred
heifers have lowed, hold we the solemn feast of the most august Father."
M. Darmesteter has argued (*Ormazd et Ahriman*, p. 152, *n*.) that "the
legends of Gods born or reared in stables; among shepherds (Krishna);
even that of Mithra as πετρογενής, in virtue of the synonymy of stone,
mountain, stable—*adri-gotra*"—all derive from the widespread bull or
cow myth. But for an interesting astronomical signification of the
stable (= the Augean) see Dupuis, *Origine de tous les Cultes*, ed.
1835-6, vii, 104.

Zarathustra likewise descends into hell (Malcolm, *History of Persia*,
ed. 1829, i, 495); and as Zarathustra like Mithra is born beside a river
(*Bundahish*, xxiv, 15), and like the Sun-Gods in general is sought to
be slain in infancy (West, *Pahlavi Texts*, i, 187, 317: *S. B. E.* v),
the two legends may be regarded as interfluent.
