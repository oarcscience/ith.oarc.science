#### § 16. The Mystery-Play and the Cultus.

In all probability the performance of the mystery-play was suspended in
the churches <span id="fr_1020"></span>[1](#fn_1020.md) when it was reduced
to narrative form as part of the gospel. The suspension may have
occurred either during a time of local persecution or by the deliberate
decision of the churches, in the second century. But such a deliberate
decision is likely to have been taken when the cult, having broken away
from Judaism, was also concerned to break away from the paganism in
contact with which the play would first arise. How far away from
Jerusalem that may have been we can hardly divine. Greek drama certainly
came much closer to Jewish life than has been recognised in the
histories. Not only were theatres built by Herod, as Josephus testifies,
at Damascus and Jericho, <span id="fr_1021"></span>[2](#fn_1021.md) but
ruins of two theatres exist at Gadara, <span
id="fr_1022"></span>[3](#fn_1022.md) described by Josephus as a Greek
town, <span id="fr_1023"></span>[4](#fn_1023.md) and known to have produced
a number of notable Hellenistic writers. <span
id="fr_1024"></span>[5](#fn_1024.md) But the presumption from what we know
of Christian origins is that the cult developed rather in the larger
than in the smaller Hellenistic cities; and it would need a fairly
strong group to produce such a mystery-play. It may indeed never have
been performed in full save at important centres, such as Antioch or
Alexandria; and when once the cult was at all widely established such a
state of things

<span id="page_205">p. 205</span>

would be inexpedient on many grounds. The reduction of the play to
narrative form put all the churches on a level, and would remove a
stumbling-block from the way of the ascetic Christists who objected to
all dramatic shows as such.

But the manner of the transcription happily preserves for us the
knowledge of the fact that it was such a show to begin with. And if we
suppose it to have grown up in a Gentile environment, say in Alexandria,
on the nucleus of the eucharist, after the model of an actual sacrifice
in which a "Jesus Barabbas" was annually offered up, we shall be so far
within the warrant of the evidence. Whether the official stoning and
hanging of an actual Jesus on a charge of sorcery and blasphemy in the
days of Alexander Jannæus had served as a fresh point of departure, is a
question that cannot at present be decided. All that is clear is that
the gospel story is unhistorical. The placing of the action of the
mystery-play in Jerusalem would be the natural course for Gentiles who
were seeking to counteract the Judaising party in a cult which founded
on a slain Jewish Jesus; since the more clearly Jerusalem and Jewry were
saddled with what had come to be regarded as an act of historic guilt,
the clearer would be the grounds for a breach with Judaism.

To locate the first performance of the play in its present shape is
beyond the possibilities of the case as the evidence stands. The detail
of the two Maries suggests Egypt, where the cult of Osiris had just such
a scene of quasi-maternal mourning; and the Egyptian ideas in the
Apocalypse, such as those of the "lake of fire" and "the second
death," <span id="fr_1025"></span>[1](#fn_1025.md) further point to
Alexandrian sources for early Jesuism; but the eucharist and burial and
resurrection are apparently Mithraistic, as are various details in the
Apocalypse; <span id="fr_1026"></span>[2](#fn_1026.md) and the Osirian
ritual, like the Mithraic, would be known in many lands. We can but say
that the death-ritual of the Christian creed is framed in a pagan
environment, and that, like the myth of the Virgin-birth, <span
id="fr_1027"></span>[3](#fn_1027.md) it embodies some of the most
widespread ideas of pagan religion. In strict truth, the two aspects in
which the historic Christ is typically presented to his worshippers,
those of his infancy and his death, are typically pagan.

But indeed there is not a conception associated with the Christ

<span id="page_206">p. 206</span>

that is not common to some or all of the Saviour cults of antiquity. The
title of Saviour, latterly confined to him, was in Judaism given to
Yahweh, <span id="fr_1028"></span>[1](#fn_1028.md) and among the Greeks to
Zeus, <span id="fr_1029"></span>[2](#fn_1029.md) to Helios; <span
id="fr_1030"></span>[3](#fn_1030.md) to Artemis, <span
id="fr_1031"></span>[4](#fn_1031.md) to Dionysos, <span
id="fr_1032"></span>[5](#fn_1032.md) to Herakles, <span
id="fr_1033"></span>[6](#fn_1033.md) to the Dioscuri, <span
id="fr_1034"></span>[7](#fn_1034.md) to Cybelê, <span
id="fr_1035"></span>[8](#fn_1035.md) to Æsculapius; <span
id="fr_1036"></span>[9](#fn_1036.md) and it is the essential conception of
the God Osiris. So, too, Osiris taketh away sin, and is judge of the
dead, and of the last judgment; and Dionysos, also Lord of the
Underworld, and primarily a God of feasting ("the Son of Man cometh
eating and drinking"), comes to be conceived as the Soul of the World,
and as the inspirer of chastity and self-purification. From the
Mysteries of Dionysos and Isis comes the proclamation of the easy
"yoke"; and the Christ not only works the Dionysiak miracle, <span
id="fr_1037"></span>[10](#fn_1037.md) but calls himself "the true
vine." <span id="fr_1038"></span>[11](#fn_1038.md) Like the Christ, and
like Adonis and Attis, Osiris and Dionysos suffer and die to rise again;
and to become one with them is the mystical passion of their
worshippers. All alike in their mysteries give immortality; and from
Mithraism the Christ takes the symbolic keys of heaven and hell, <span
id="fr_1039"></span>[12](#fn_1039.md) even as he assumes the function of
the Virgin-born Mithra-Saoshyant, the destroyer of the Evil One. <span
id="fr_1040"></span>[13](#fn_1040.md) Like Mithra, Merodach, <span
id="fr_1041"></span>[14](#fn_1041.md) and the Egyptian Khonsu, <span
id="fr_1042"></span>[15](#fn_1042.md) he is the Mediator; like Khonsu,
Horus, and Merodach, he is one of a trinity; <span
id="fr_1043"></span>[16](#fn_1043.md) like Horus, he is grouped with a
divine Mother; like Khonsu, he is joined with the Logos; <span
id="fr_1044"></span>[17](#fn_1044.md) and like Merodach, he is associated
with a Holy Spirit, one of whose symbols is fire. <span
id="fr_1045"></span>[18](#fn_1045.md) In fundamentals, in short, Christism
is but paganism re-shaped: it is only the economic and the doctrinal
evolution of the system—the first determined by Jewish practice and
Roman environment, <span id="fr_1046"></span>[19](#fn_1046.md) and the
second by Greek thought <span id="fr_1047"></span>[20](#fn_1047.md)—that
constitute new phenomena in religious history.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1020"></span>[204:1](pch43.htm#fr_1020.md) It has been argued,
with considerable probability, that one or two Gnostic sects had rites
of initiation in which were included a mystery-play of the crucifixion
(G. R. S. Mead, *Fragments of a Faith Forgotten*, 2nd ed. 1906, pp.
426-444). But the same writer's-thesis (*Did Jesus Live 100 B.C.?* 1903,
p. 410) as to a rite of resurrection in the late Isiac worship at
Alexandria is not borne out by the passage of Epiphanius (*Haer.* li,
22) upon which he founds. That tells solely of a symbolising of the
"birth of the æon" through the Virgin Goddess. The symbol of the cross
on the forehead, knees, and hands of the image carried round the temple
on the night of Epiphany is not proof of any concept of crucifixion
being involved. Mr. Mead, it should be added, believes in a historical
Jesus or Christ with supernormal powers.

<span id="fn_1026"></span>[205:2](pch43.htm#fr_1026.md) Thus the Logos as
"faithful and true" and righteous judge and *warrior* (Rev. xix, 11)
points to Mithra; and though Thoth had seven assistants, the sacred
"sevens" of the Apocalypse and the whole imagery of the Lamb seem
specially Mithraic. Still the "Lamb slain" figured notably in the
worship of Amun, being laid on the image of the God Amun and ritually
mourned for, while the image of the Sun-God stood by (Herodotus, ii,
42). And the warrior Logos *may* stand for Horos-Munt (Tiele, *Egyptian
