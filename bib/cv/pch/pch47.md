#### § 2. The Logos.

All such doctrines, it is probable, were represented in the later, if
not in the earlier, Babylonian religion; and the idea of the Logos is
probably early in Mazdeism; <span id="fr_1117"></span>[2](#fn_1117.md) but
in any case it was from the outside that it was pressed upon Judaism, to
the extent, as we have seen, <span id="fr_1118"></span>[3](#fn_1118.md) of
making a personality out of that Word of God which originally "came" to
the prophets in the sense that his spirit was held to have entered into
them. The whole evolution is noticeably parallel to that of the
principles of law and government in States, from the stage in which the
king or chief is judge and as such "God" to that in which he is
surrounded by graded orders of priests and councillors, jurists and
administrators. The Logos is in a manner the heavenly Grand
Vizier. <span id="fr_1119"></span>[4](#fn_1119.md)

It is impossible, however, to fix a date for the origin of the special
dogma of the Logos. To take it as a Greek invention is to ignore the
very problem of origins. An eminent Sanskritist assures us in one
passage not only that the doctrine of the Logos is "exclusively Aryan,"
but that "whoever uses such words as *Logos*, the Word, *Monogenês*, the
Only-begotten, *Prototokos*, the First-born, *Hyios tou theou*, the Son
of God, has borrowed the very germs of his religious thoughts from Greek
philosophy"; <span id="fr_1120"></span>[5](#fn_1120.md) while in another
passage he admits that the conceptions of the Word as found in the
Psalms <span id="fr_1121"></span>[6](#fn_1121.md) and of the Angel as found
in the Pentateuch "are purely Jewish, uninfluenced as yet by any Greek
thought." <span id="fr_1122"></span>[7](#fn_1122.md) Other eminent
Sanskritists, again, have shown that the River-Goddess Sarasvatî is in
the later Brahmanic mythology "identified with Vâch" or Vâc \[= Speech\]
"and becomes under different names the spouse of Brahma and the goddess
of wisdom and eloquence, and is invoked as a Muse"; while in the
Mahâbhârata she is called the "mother of the Vedas." <span
id="fr_1123"></span>[8](#fn_1123.md) Elsewhere the personified Vâch enters
into the

<span id="page_219">p. 219</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Rishis or sages as
inspiration. <span id="fr_1124"></span>[1](#fn_1124.md) Again, "When the
Brahmarshis were performing austerities prior to the creation of the
universe 'a voice derived from Brahma entered into the ears of them all:
the celestial Sarasvatî was then produced from the heavens!'" <span
id="fr_1125"></span>[2](#fn_1125.md)

As among the Greeks and the Jews, so among the Hindus the doctrine of
the sacred or creative Word is various. In the Satapatha Brâhmana,
Prajapati (who is "composed of Seven Males") first of all things created
the Veda, which became the foundation on which he "created the waters
from the world in the form of speech. Speech belonged to him. It was
created. It pervaded all this." In the same document the cosmic egg is
the primordial source: "From it the Veda was first created—the triple
essence. Hence men say, 'the Veda is the first-born of this whole
creation.....They say of a learned man that he is like Agni, for the
Veda is Agni's mouth.'" <span id="fr_1126"></span>[3](#fn_1126.md) The
personified Vâch, Sarasvatî, River-Goddess and Goddess of Speech, is
doubtless the later evolution, <span id="fr_1127"></span>[4](#fn_1127.md)
just as is the Græco-Jewish *Sophia;* but there can be no question that
the conception of the Veda as the Word, the first-created thing or
first-born Being, is fully present in the Brâhmanas. In the Taittariya
Brâhmana, "Vâch (speech) is an imperishable thing......the mother of the
Vedas, and the centre point of immortality"; <span
id="fr_1128"></span>[5](#fn_1128.md) being thus identified with Sarasvatî
as aforesaid; but this does not affect the dogma, set forth by Sankara,
that "from the eternal Word the world is produced." <span
id="fr_1129"></span>[6](#fn_1129.md) Again, in the Satapatha Brâhmana
"Speech is the Rig-Veda, mind the Yajur Vedah, breath the Sâma
Veda." <span id="fr_1130"></span>[7](#fn_1130.md) In the Taittariya, it is
true, the Veda is created after the Soma; <span
id="fr_1131"></span>[8](#fn_1131.md) but such a variation, we shall see,
occurs also in Jewish lore. And among the Vedantists, finally, "the
'word' (*sabda*) is 'God' (*Brahma*)." <span
id="fr_1132"></span>[9](#fn_1132.md) As regards, again, the more
philosophical side of the *Logos* doctrine, the conception of an
all-pervading and primordial Reason (Tao or Tau), we find it most
explicitly and coherently set forth in China by Lao-Tsze, with a
doctrine of a unity and trinity of forms of existence, <span
id="fr_1133"></span>[10](#fn_1133.md) in the sixth century before our
era. <span id="fr_1134"></span>[11](#fn_1134.md)

Are we then to suppose that such speculation originated with the Ionian
Greeks, was passed on by them to the Jews, and by Jews or

<span id="page_220">p. 220</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Greeks or both to
the Persians, and thence to the Brahmans and the Chinese? Such a
hypothesis is visibly unmanageable. The Pythagorean derivation of
Plato's doctrine of the Logos is tolerably clear; and its connection
with the planetary lore of the eight heavenly powers, as well as with
the lore of numbers and proportion, <span
id="fr_1135"></span>[1](#fn_1135.md) tells of a source such as only the
Chaldean or Egyptian schools of astrology and astronomy can be supposed
to represent in the early Greek sphere. Babylonian religion contains the
principle of the Logos in its most definite primary form, the doctrine
of the Divine Name, which is the germ of the Platonic doctrine of ideas
no less than of the Philonic and Johannine theology. We even find it in
a form approximated-to in the Pentateuch (where the "name" of Yahweh is
"in" the promised "Angel" leader), <span
id="fr_1136"></span>[2](#fn_1136.md) and made familiar later by the Jewish
*Toledoth Jeschu* as well as by the modified Christian formula—the
teaching, namely, that the mystic name of the Supreme God is known to
him alone, and is revealed by him solely to his son, who has thus
virtually all power in heaven and on earth. <span
id="fr_1137"></span>[3](#fn_1137.md)

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"This idea, which prevailed equally in Egypt and in
Western Asia, is purely animistic. To pronounce a name is to call up and
conjure the being who bears it. The name possesses personality...... To
name a thing is to create it: that is why creation is often represented
as accomplished by the word." <span
id="fr_1138"></span>[4](#fn_1138.md)</span>

</div>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Further, we know
from Damascius—whose list of Babylonian God-names is made good by the
remains actually discovered in recent times—that Tauthê, Mother of the
Gods, first bore a son, Moymis, who was "the intelligible world." <span
id="fr_1139"></span>[5](#fn_1139.md) Here is the very formula of Philo. Of
the God Nebo, too, who has so many attributes of the Logos, it is noted
that his Akkadian prototype "was once the universe itself" <span
id="fr_1140"></span>[6](#fn_1140.md)—a likely source of such an
identification in his case. If then the Jews had the Logos idea before
their contact with the Greeks and the Mazdeans, <span
id="fr_1141"></span>[7](#fn_1141.md) the reasonable assumption is that they
had it from a source from which the Mazdeans and Ionian Greeks could
also have it—the Babylonian lore, in which were accumulated the current
fancies of thousands of years of Asiatic speculation, including that of
the ancient civilisation from

<span id="page_221">p. 221</span>

which was derived that of the Chinese. And when we find the Brahmanic
philosophy, like the Babylonian and Greek, making all things originate
from a watery abyss, <span id="fr_1142"></span>[1](#fn_1142.md) and again
from the cosmic egg, <span id="fr_1143"></span>[2](#fn_1143.md) we have at
least cause to surmise that the Babylonian and Indian systems draw from
one central source. It is true that the Indian lore seems best to
combine the ideas of origination through the Word and through Water; and
that the word *Saras* means not only Water but Voice, whence Sarasvatî =
not only "the watery" but also "the vocal" or "the sounding." <span
id="fr_1144"></span>[3](#fn_1144.md) Here, too, we seem to be in touch with
primitive thought, for among the (perhaps partly Semitised) Yorubas of
Nigeria there seems to have been a primary conception of moving water as
the source of sound and of wisdom. <span
id="fr_1145"></span>[4](#fn_1145.md) But while this is visibly more
homogeneous than the late Hebrew evolution of a creative *Sophia* who
equates with the creative *Logos* without any adaptation to the
primordial abyss of waters (or "Ocean Stream" as in Homer) on which the
"Spirit" had creatively moved, on the other hand the relative
lateness <span id="fr_1146"></span>[5](#fn_1146.md) of the evolution of
Vâch and Sarasvatî leaves open the presumption that a foreign influence
has been at work. Agni, also, the Fire-God, is finally identified with
the Word; he too, in the Vedas, is the Son of the Water and messenger of
the Gods; <span id="fr_1147"></span>[6](#fn_1147.md) and his worship
connects visibly with the fire-worship not only of the Mazdeans but of
the Babylonians, for whom also Gibil and Nusku (or Gibil-Nusku) the
Fire-Gods are sons of the Creator, Gibil in particular being "the
first-born of heaven (Anu) and the image of his father," while Ea, the
Water-God, is the lord of life, and also the father of the Fire-God, who
in turn is the messenger and counsellor of the Gods, clothed with their
attributes. <span id="fr_1148"></span>[7](#fn_1148.md) The blended
characteristics of Sarasvatî, finally, are found in the Babylonian
Goddess Sarpanitum, who, as finally blended with Erua, the daughter of
Ea, was at once "lady of the deep," "voice of the deep," and "the
possessor of knowledge concealed from men "attributes all deriving from
the fact that "wisdom and the life-giving principle were two ideas
associated in the Babylonian mind with

<span id="page_222">p. 222</span>

water." <span id="fr_1149"></span>[1](#fn_1149.md) In these various
nations, surely, we have the true "germs" alike of the Hindu, the
Heraklitean, and the Platonic concepts of the Word or Reason; of the
conception of Hermes as Logos and Messenger of the Gods; of Apollo as
his father's wisdom; of the Hindu, of the Hebrew, and of the Greek
formulas of "First-born" and "Only-begotten"; and so alike of the later
Judaic and the Christian theosophy.

The further research is carried into the affiliation of the cults and
creeds of Asia Minor and Syria, the more clearly does it appear that all
relate to the great central mass of theosophy accumulated in Babylonia,
which was still a culture force in the earlier centuries of the
Christian era. <span id="fr_1150"></span>[2](#fn_1150.md) That system had
inferribly given to the Christian Gnostics their astrology and magic;
their doctrine of the immortality of souls (not bodies); their *Sophia;*
their conception of a Saviour, Knowledge-Giver, and Mediator: <span
id="fr_1151"></span>[3](#fn_1151.md) it is sufficiently unlikely, then,
that it had failed to evolve as did Brahmanism the concept of the Logos.
The rational presumption is that it gave that concept to Greek and Jew
alike.

But the Jewish evolution was apparently piecemeal. Different ideas and
doctrines, such as that of Metis, Thoth, Thoth-Khonsu, the combined
*Logos* (Moon-God) and Sun-God; <span id="fr_1152"></span>[4](#fn_1152.md)
Vohumano, the "Good Mind," combined with Mithra; <span
id="fr_1153"></span>[5](#fn_1153.md) and the Platonic *Logos*, probably
motived the separate evolution in Judaic literature of the
personifications of *Sophia* or Wisdom, <span
id="fr_1154"></span>[6](#fn_1154.md) the "Good Spirit," <span
id="fr_1155"></span>[7](#fn_1155.md) and the later *Logos*. In one book the
*Logos* "leaps down from heaven out of the royal throne," <span
id="fr_1156"></span>[8](#fn_1156.md) and "as a fierce man of war" wields
the divine command as a destructive sword; <span
id="fr_1157"></span>[9](#fn_1157.md) in another, *Sophia* is as distinctly
personified: she "came out of the Most High," but he created her "from
the beginning before the world," and she alone "encompassed the circuit
of heaven." <span id="fr_1158"></span>[10](#fn_1158.md) The writer means to
be metaphorical, but for the many the effect must be graphic. And

<span id="page_223">p. 223</span>

this development took place and prepared for yet others, though Judaism
was ostensibly bound to resist the multiplication of personalities thus
set up, and was further predisposed to a male as against a female
principle. In this respect, as in so many others, it exhibits its
derivations from and affinities with savage thought, for among the
Yorubas of Nigeria, in our own time, we find the primary conception,
first, of the "natural" trinity of Father, Mother, and Son, with the
general concept, behind that, of the Mother of All, who in time tends to
be resolved into or superseded by a male; <span
id="fr_1159"></span>[1](#fn_1159.md) perhaps as a result of the
supersession of the matriarchate. Some such progression seems to have
taken place among the Hebrews. The original "Holy Spirit," properly
feminine, had in general been kept very much in the background, perhaps
in fear of the old developments of goddess-worship, in which the symbol
of the dove, taken by the Christists as standing for chastity, had
really represented sexuality and fecundity. <span
id="fr_1160"></span>[2](#fn_1160.md) But the mythopœic faculty, in its new
forms of verbalism and pseudo-philosophy, was stronger than dogma, and
stronger than fear. Accordingly we have Philo, at the traditional
beginning of the Christian era, accumulating round the Logos the various
aspects of the earlier Word and Sophia, and fitfully adding to them
those of divine Sonship and Messiahship, and even the creative function
of Demiourgos, thus at times reducing Yahweh to a somewhat remote
abstraction.
