#### § 13. The Point of Junction.

And still we have to note what appears to be the strangest concrete
survival of all, cherished where we should least count on finding it. At
Rome there is religiously preserved a chair which is alleged to be that
of St. Peter. It is significant of the measure of knowledge and judgment
with which the Church has been governed that this belief should subsist
concerning a chair which ostensibly

<span id="page_335">p. 335</span>

bears representations of the signs of the zodiac, and the twelve labours
of the Sun-God. <span id="fr_1738"></span>[1](#fn_1738.md) Peter, we are to
suppose, having found his way to Rome, and established a Latin Church
with the facility which belonged to inspiration and the gift of tongues,
proceeded to commission a sculptor, Pagan or Christian, to carve him an
episcopal chair, ornamented with the best-known symbols of the
heathenism which Christians were supposed to be bent on overthrowing.
Such a legend need not be discussed. <span
id="fr_1739"></span>[2](#fn_1739.md)

We have already seen how at a variety of points the myth of Peter is a
development of that of Jesus, and how, alike as leader of the twelve,
fisherman, "rock," and bearer of the keys of heaven and hell, the first
disciple assimilates with Mithra and Janus, who severally or jointly had
those attributes, and whose joint cult acquired a special status in the
Roman empire as being at once that of the army and (on the side of
Janus) that of the immemorial city. And whereas the legendary Peter thus
closely conformed in symbol to the "God out of the Rock," the chief
priest of the Mithraic cult at Rome compared no less closely with the
Christian bishop, ultimately distinguished as *Papa* = Father. Among the
grades of the Mithraists were that of the *Patres Sacrorum*, or Fathers
of the Mysteries, and that of the *Pater Patrum*, Father of the Fathers,
whose seat was at Rome; and while there was a sacred Mithraic cave under
the Capitol, we know from monumental remains that Mithraic worship was
conducted on the Vatican Mount, where also was a temple of the
Mother-Goddess Cybelê, and where also dwelt the *Archi-Gallus*, or arch
eunuch, the head of the cult of Cybelê and Attis. <span
id="fr_1740"></span>[3](#fn_1740.md) As the ruling tendency of the later
paganism was to combine or "syndicate" all the leading cults, and as
Roman patricians were then wont to hold at once the priesthoods of
various Gods, it is not surprising to find that in the year 376, under
the emperors Valens and Valentinian, one Sextilius Agesilaus Ædesius was
*Pater Patrum Dei Solis Invicti Mithræ*, "born again for eternity
through the *taurobolium* and the *criobolium*," and at the same time
priest of Hecate and of Bacchus, as well as an adorer of the Mother of
the Gods and Attis. <span id="fr_1741"></span>[4](#fn_1741.md) On the
Vatican Mount, then, if anywhere, would be the seat of the pagan Pope
who looked to the Sun-God as his Saviour, and worshipped the Mother of
the Gods.

<span id="page_336">p. 336</span>

It has been unsuspectingly asserted on the Christian side that the
pagans raised their later shrines on the Vatican Mount by way of
profaning the site of the grave of St. Peter. We are now entitled to
conclude that, on the contrary, the grave of St. Peter was located by
tradition on the Vatican Mount because that was the Roman site of the
pagan cult to which the myth of Peter was specially assimilated. His
grave was assigned where his legend was adumbrated, and, it may be,
where his chair was found. For there is some reason to suppose that the
"chair of St. Peter" is simply the chair of the *Pater Patrum*, the
supreme pontiff of Mithra at Rome.

In reality, the "Chair of St. Peter" is a somewhat nondescript object,
of which the ornamentation does not fully exhibit either the twelve
signs of the zodiac or the twelve labours of Herakles. It was exhibited
to the public in 1867, photographed, and at that time examined by the
eminent archæologist de Rossi, who pronounced it to be in part of old
oak much worn, containing a number of inlaid panels of carved ivory in
the classic style, representing the labours of Hercules; the whole
structure, however, having been renewed by supports and cross-pieces of
acacia-wood, of which the ornamentation is medieval. <span
id="fr_1742"></span>[1](#fn_1742.md) In Rossi's opinion the older portions
probably formed originally the curial chair of a senator; and it may be
that the whole thing is thus a fortuitous importation, like so many
other ecclesiastical relics. But there is an obvious possibility that it
is a relic of a pre-Christian cult; and this is rather more likely than
would be the sanctification of a mere senator's chair.

The ivory panels, eighteen in number, and not easy to decipher in a
photograph, answer in part to the labours of Herakles; a few have simply
the zodiacal signs from which the legend of the twelve labours was
originally framed; some suggest rather the labours of Perseus; and some
closely resemble episodes in the Mithraic monuments. It is not
impossible, then, that the whole is an ancient artist's combination, for
a syncretic cult, of a number of the symbols of oriental sun-worship, to
which all three legends belong. The myth of Perseus (perhaps = the
Persian) is at bottom identical with that of Herakles; and in Rome the
Mithraists would be very ready to bracket the later conquering Sun-God
with the older, the more so because their monuments presented scenes of
the same order, and conjunction of cults was the fashion of the day. The
old Roman Hercules, it will be remembered, was a quite different deity
from the

<span id="page_337">p. 337</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Grecian Herakles,
who was a variant of the Semitic Melkarth and Samson; and though that
Herakles was worshipped under the later pagan emperors by his Latin
name, it does not appear that at Rome his cult was latterly flourishing.
Tertullian indeed asserts that in his day there has been seen
(*vidimus*) a man burnt alive as Hercules (= Herakles); <span
id="fr_1743"></span>[1](#fn_1743.md) but though this was a ritual sacrifice
its solitary celebration tells rather of a Roman show than of a cult.
There were two shrines of Hercules Victor on the Capitoline Hill, and
some three other *aedes* in other districts; <span
id="fr_1744"></span>[2](#fn_1744.md) but the inscriptions of the period
show no such interest in his cult as in those of Mithra and other
eastern deities. There was in fact no ritualistic worship of Hercules or
Herakles at Rome; nothing to account for the use of such a chair;
whereas the mysteries of Mithra were among the most elaborate then in
existence, and the Mithraic priesthood one of the most august. Finally,
we know from Porphyry, and from the monuments, <span
id="fr_1745"></span>[3](#fn_1745.md) that Mithra was habitually represented
in the midst of the zodiacal circle, so that the pretended Petrine chair
is in every way congruous with his worship. The fact that, in the
Mithraic monuments, the zodiac begins with Aquarius, who in ancient art
is represented somewhat as a fisherman, would of course appeal to the
champions of Peter, whose ancient festival at Rome (Jan. 18) coincided
with the sun's entering Aquarius in the calendar: and it is the historic
fact that the Mithraic order of the zodiac, beginning on the right with
Aquarius and ending on the left with Capricorn, was imitated in
Christian art. <span id="fr_1746"></span>[4](#fn_1746.md)

If, as we have surmised, an official substitution of Christism for
Mithraism began under Jovian when the latter cult was discredited for
Roman purposes by the defeat and death of Julian at the hands of the
Persians, it is likely enough that an official change of the kind was
effected at Rome, the Mithraic *Pater* being either superseded or simply
Christianised. In taking over the status of the Mithraic pontiff, the
Christian *Papa* of Rome would acquire whatever remained of his
influence in the army and in the civil service, besides completing the
process of uniting in his own person the symbolisms in virtue of which
he was head of the visible Church. It was thus in many ways fitting that
he should take to himself the actual chair of the *Pater Patrum*.
However that may be, the historical and documentary facts enable us to
infer broadly the line

<span id="page_338">p. 338</span>

of adaptation of Mithraism to the Christian cult. It was presumably
thus:—

1\. Before the gospels were written, Jesus as "Lamb" was assimilated to
Mithra in respect (*a*) of his attributes of "Seven Spirits" and "seven
stars"; (*b*) of his symbol of the Rock; and (*e*) of the mystic keys
borne by the Time-God in his mysteries. In all three cases there seem to
have been ancient Judaic myths to proceed upon.

2\. The resurrection ritual, with its rock tomb, and the eucharist of
bread and wine, may have been equally ancient even in Jewry; but there
is reason to suppose that both were consciously assimilated to the
Mithraic mysteries.

3\. As the Mithraic *Pater Patrum* assumed the symbols of the God, and
the Christian bishop of Rome imitated the *Pater Patrum*, the tradition
came to transfer from Jesus to Peter, the reputed founder of the Roman
see, the attributes of the Persian God, and of those with whom he was
identified in Rome. Thus whereas Jesus had been key-bearer and Rock
before the gospels were current, Peter finally was foisted on the gospel
in both capacities, while the more exclusively divine attribute of
headship of the Seven Spirits was practically dropped from Christian
doctrine; and even the symbol of the lamb was discountenanced. They had
done their work, and were finally both incongruous and inconvenient.
