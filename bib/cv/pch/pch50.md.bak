#### § 5. The Critical Problem.

The problem is one that has been before now debated on other issues; and
it may be well here to take up these by way of illumination and test.
Grote, putting in scientific form a thesis sometimes more summarily
phrased by "the plain man," insisted that

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"The utmost which we accomplish by means of the
semi-historical theory is that, after leaving out from the mythical
narrative all that is miraculous or high-coloured or extravagant, we
arrive at a series of creditable \[= credible\] incidents—incidents
which *may perhaps* have really occurred, and against which no intrinsic
presumption can be raised. This is exactly the character of a
well-written modern novel......To raise plausible fiction to the
superior dignity of truth, some positive testimony or positive ground of
inference must be shown......A man who tells us that on the day of the
battle of Platæa rain fell on the spot of ground where the city of New
York now stands, will neither deserve nor obtain credit, because he can
have no means of positive knowledge; though the statement is not in the
slightest degree improbable. On the other hand, statements in themselves
very improbable may well deserve belief, provided they be supported by
sufficient positive evidence. Thus the canal dug by Xerxes across the
promontory of Mount Athos, and the sailing of the Persian fleet through
it, is a fact which I believe because it is
well-attested—notwithstanding its remarkable improbability, which so far
misled Juvenal as to induce him to single out the narrative as a glaring
example of Grecian mendacity. <span
id="fr_1189"></span>[1](#fn_1189.md)</span>

</div>

To this contention it is objected by Sir A. C. Lyall that "if we may
only receive as credible those ancient narratives which *could not
possibly* turn out to be very plausible fiction, we shall be hard pushed
for the trustworthy authentication of much early history, religious and
secular. Secondly, the example of the supposed assertion as to
simultaneous rainfall at Platæa and in Massachusetts is hardly fair. A
man's assertion of an isolated fact of which he could not possibly have
any positive knowledge, either directly or by hearsay, is a very
different thing from affirming credible facts which might reasonably,
and according to the known habits of the people who relate the facts,
have been handed down by tradition from the persons who witnessed them
to those who related them." <span id="fr_1190"></span>[2](#fn_1190.md) To
this very reasonable argument the answer is that it does not meet
Grote's case; and that when we have assented to it the problem remains
as before. In regard to many credible facts which *might* conceivably
have been handed down by tradition we are still bound to say that, when
related concerning supernatural personages, they are not tolerable
evidence of anything done by a real person whose history formed the
nucleus of the myth. The proposition as

<span id="page_232">p. 232</span>

to rain on the site of New York on the day of Platæa is an illustration,
not a universal parallel. The fact remains that there is no common-sense
ground for crediting any one "credible" assertion made concerning an
ostensibly mythical character when we cannot on independent grounds show
how the credible story came to be attached to the fable.

Sir Alfred Lyall's argument overlooks the demurrer that *all* particular
or specific tradition of a quasi-historical kind is untrustworthy when
not corroborated by other evidence, inasmuch as (1) such tradition
usually goes hand in hand with obvious supernaturalist fable, and (2)
many such traditions have been disproved by solid evidence. The question
is not whether something traditionally asserted to have been said or
done by a demigod may not actually have been said or done by a man of
the same or another name, but whether, in the absence of other evidence,
we are ever entitled to believe and assert that it was. To Grote's
negative answer there is no valid demurrer. The strength of Sir A. C.
Lyall's general claim, that Gods or God-myths have been built up on
bases of actual deeds and events, lies in the concrete proof that this
has occurred in modern times; but no such demonstration can enable us to
distinguish between the merely possible and the true in ancient
tradition. It is conceivable that the Feridun of the Shah Nameh is
constructed on a nucleus of reality, to which was added a mass of detail
taken from sheer mythology, as myths were heaped upon the story of
Cyrus. But in the latter case we have a means of discrimination; in the
former we have none; and when we find the very name of Feridun to be a
modification of an old God-name, <span id="fr_1191"></span>[1](#fn_1191.md)
we have no right of historical belief left.

For the rest, it is beside the case to argue that much accepted history
will be cancelled if we accept only narratives which "could not possibly
turn out to be plausible fiction." Grote never argued that history
proper, the record of a time by those who lived in it, is to be so
tried; and he constantly accepts narratives which might conceivably be
plausible fictions—nay, he occasionally accepts tales which appear to
some of us to be fictions. It is when we are dealing with myths that he
denies our power to discriminate: in history proper he undertakes—at
times too confidently—to discriminate. Broadly speaking, he is entitled
so to proceed insofar as he deals with cases on their merits. Some early
historical narratives allege facts which could well be known to the
narrator or to the community

<span id="page_233">p. 233</span>

in general, and may be fairly taken as true; some are obviously
fanciful, unplausible, ill-vouched; and in many cases they are to be
doubted even when free from supernaturalism. Historiography consists in
a rational selection.

It is true that there are some cases wholly or partly on the borderland
between the possible and the incredible, where we may fairly surmise a
nucleus of fact; but in regard to these Grote's warning should be always
kept in mind. Professor Huxley, who invented the word "agnostic" to
cover, among other things, the practice of saying that miracles are "not
impossible," was notably accommodating in his attitude to narratives of
the possible. Concerning the story of Saul's visit to the witch of
Endor, he observes that it does not "matter very much whether the story
is historically true," but that "it is quite consistent with
probability"; and then he adds: "*That is to say*, I see *no reason
whatever to doubt*......that Saul made such a visit." <span
id="fr_1192"></span>[1](#fn_1192.md) The leap here is clearly illicit.
There is certainly "reason to doubt" the whole story so long as it
cannot be shown to have been reduced to writing near the time of Saul.
"History" is full of discredited "probabilities" of the same kind: the
story of Bruce and the spider is a type. The very fact that kings and
commoners in ancient Israel did normally consult witches is as much a
reason for admitting that the story could easily be invented as for
allowing that it could easily have happened; and the details of the
apparition, to which Professor Huxley oddly extends a measure of his
credence, give good ground for suspecting the entire episode to be
fiction.

All such cases, in fine, must be tried on their documentary as well as
their h priori merits; and, returning to our special problem, we note
that the "credible" sayings put in the mouth of the Gospel Jesus are in
no way certified by their credibility, but are on the contrary put in
complete suspicion by their surroundings. Here is Professor Schmiedel's
case, reduced to logical form: There are in the gospels hundreds of
unlikely sayings ascribed to Jesus; there are nine which are likely;
then the nine not only establish his historic reality, but give a basis
for surmise that many of the less likely, as well as many of the
narratives of faith-healing, are also historical! The answer is (1) that
it must be a desperately bad fiction in which not five per cent. of the
speeches and episodes are "credible." On Dr. Schmiedel's view, if only
the ancients had ascribed ten reasonable sayings as well as twelve more
or less

<span id="page_234">p. 234</span>

unlikely labours to Herakles he would be entitled to rank as a historic
character. On the other hand (2) the very fact that the figure of the
Gospel Jesus *won belief* much more in virtue of the hundreds of
improbabilities and falsities in the gospels than in virtue of the
"credible" texts, quashes the plea for his actuality based on these
texts. The true inference is, not that such texts, being unnecessary,
must be genuine and not invented, but that since a substantially false
or unlikely biography could win ready credence in the period in question
there is no reason to surmise a nucleus of actuality which was never
demanded, and that the credible texts stand merely for the proportion of
plausibility that might reasonably be looked for in any conglomerate of
sayings and statements round a fictitious personage. Paul or the
forgers, it is evident, believed in a crucified Jesus as to whom they
had no biographical record, whether of sayings or doings. Scores of
unlikely utterances, it is admitted, were credited to Jesus after Paul's
time. Why were they so credited? Plainly because certain men or certain
sects desired to give their views the sanction of the God-Man's
authority. What then does it signify if besides these sayings there are
fathered on him a few that are relatively reasonable? And, knowing as we
do that the Ebionites, who attributed to him unlikely sayings,
nevertheless regarded him as a mere man, what does it signify if
sometimes in the gospel he is so represented? Yet again, what
plausibility remains in the cry on the cross, "Why hast thou forsaken
me?" when we remember that it is a quotation from the Psalms, and that
the whole cult proceeded on the doctrine that "the Christ must needs
suffer"? <span id="fr_1193"></span>[1](#fn_1193.md)

It may seem ungracious thus to press the argument against a professed
theologian who has already come within sight of "the great surrender" to
reason. Schmiedel has indeed gone further in his loyalty to the critical
principle than do many professed rationalists. It is only a question of
time, however, when his view shall be tested as he has tested other
men's, and the process may as well begin here and now.
