#### § 9. Conclusion.

There has thus emerged from a survey of the comparative

<span id="page_95">p. 95</span>

evolution of religions the conclusion that not only do all undergo
change in spite of the special religious aversion to change, but all
evolve by the same laws, their differences being invariably reducible to
effects of environment. Of this the decisive proof is the fact that,
under the very roof of a professed monotheism, there arose as aforesaid
a secondary God-idea on the lines of a normal process of polytheism. The
law of the process is everywhere an interposition of a new God, evolved
by later psychosis, between the worshippers and the earlier God, so long
as the God-idea remains a psychic need. Only the violent rupture with
Christism, and the ensuing feud, prevented Judaism from obeying the law
in the normal manner: what happened was that on the severance of the new
cult from the old, the older deity was himself modified, with, for a
time, somewhat grotesque results. <span id="fr_361"></span>[1](#fn_361.md)
But for Christists the new God stands to the old in the convenient
relation that was normal in the original environment—that of son. Even
as Apollo, and Athenê, and Attis, and Herakles, and Dionysos, had to
become children of Zeus, and Merodach the son of Ea, and Khonsu the son
of Amun at Thebes, <span id="fr_362"></span>[2](#fn_362.md) and Mithra the
son of Ahura-Mazda, the Judæo-Greek Logos had to be the son of Yahweh,
the anti-Judaic animus of the Gnostics failing to oust the already
formed myth. <span id="fr_363"></span>[3](#fn_363.md)

Such an evolution stands in all cases alike for the simple need of the
worshipper who has ceased to relate fully to the old environment, and is
appealed to by a cult coming from an environment like his own, or adapts
his old God to a new moral climate. In the oldest systems known to us
such modifications are seen taking place. Already in the Vedas, Indra,
originally a God of thunder and storm, has been "touched with emotion"
till he becomes of the order of the Beloved Gods, giving and receiving
the love of men; <span id="fr_364"></span>[4](#fn_364.md) and still his
cult was in its own sphere largely superseded by that of Krishna, <span
id="fr_365"></span>[5](#fn_365.md) who could better be made to play the
part. In Egypt, again, Osiris is visibly made to meet the need for a
"nearer God" by assuming new characteristics from age to age; <span
id="fr_366"></span>[6](#fn_366.md) and yet, after millenniums of
possession, he seems to have waned before Serapis, who in turn ceded,
not without force, to Jesus. <span id="fr_367"></span>[7](#fn_367.md) All
the while, indeed, inferior

<span id="page_96">p. 96</span>

deities were popular by reason of the same general need for a God "near
at hand." <span id="fr_368"></span>[1](#fn_368.md)

In the so-called "Aryan" religions the process is essentially the same.
Apollo had to supervene on Zeus, as Zeus had done on Kronos; and "that
father lost, lost his," in a sufficiently primitive myth. Where new
culture-contacts follow each other rapidly, and the rites of one
accredited Son-God fail to meet the newest psychic needs, another is
given him as a brother; and so Dionysos, grouped in another triad,
stands alongside of Apollo. This is accomplished in spite of the most
furious resistance of kings and men who see in the new cult only evil
and madness; till in time the priests of Apollo, who can have been no
less resentful, give it a place in their chief temple. <span
id="fr_369"></span>[2](#fn_369.md) In all such developments, the new God
partially supersedes the older, <span id="fr_370"></span>[3](#fn_370.md)
whatever formalities be maintained; and no further explanation is needed
for the fact, so fallaciously stressed in some modern propaganda, that
many savages recognise a Supreme God or Creator to whom they do not
sacrifice or pray. <span id="fr_371"></span>[4](#fn_371.md) The Supreme
God, so to speak, has retired from business, in virtue not of any
superiority of character but of the law of divine superannuation.

Nor is there any limit to the process of substitution save in the
cessation of the need. All heresy, all dissent, is but a subsidiary
phase of the process which in old time evolved new Gods. The early
Church could live down the manifold imaginations of Gnosticism, because
they were framed for the speculative minds, and such minds tended to
disappear as the intellectual decadence continued; but only after long
convulsions, desperate persecution, and much exhaustion, could it live
down its more intimate heresies; and when Arianism and Manichæism seemed
at length destroyed, it was only to rise again in new forms, philosophic
on the one side, popular on the other.

And the Gods survive in the ratio of their capacity to meet either order
or need—that is to say, in the ratio of the adaptive skill and economic
address of their prophets and priests. Without such adaptation they are
insalvable. In the orthodox Christian trinity, framed under Judaic
restrictions, the Holy Spirit has been

<span id="page_97">p. 97</span>

from first to last, technically speaking, a failure, being for all
practical purposes superseded by the Virgin Mother, and for all
philosophic purposes merged in the Logos on the one hand and in the
Father-God on the other. But just as Jesus tended to supersede Yahweh,
so Mary in large measure tended to supersede Jesus, who is seen to have
become more inaccessible and supernal as his Mother was made in her turn
to play the part of Mediator. There are even traces in later medieval
art of a tendency to make Mary's mother, Saint Anna, take the place of
the Father in a new trinity; and the similar tendency to create a
secondary trinity out of the human father and mother and son, Joseph and
Mary and Jesus, is not yet exhausted. <span
id="fr_372"></span>[1](#fn_372.md) It depends upon the total fortunes of
civilisation whether that tendency shall be realised, or be arrested by
the culture-forces which are at present disintegrating all theistic
thought.

In fine, Christ-making is but a form or stage of God-making, the Christs
or Son-Gods being but secondary Gods. Of necessity they are evolved out
of prior material—the material, it may be, of primitive cults to which
men reverted in times of distress and despair of help from the Gods in
nominal power; but when the reversion persists the old material is
transformed, and the result is a new God who, Antæus-like, has fresh
vitality through contact with the primary sources of religious emotion,
but is turned to the account of new phases of emotion, moral and other.
Thus in the Hellenised cult of the Thrakian Bacchus, out of the very
riot of savagery, the reek of blood and of living flesh torn by the
hands and teeth of wine-maddened Mœnads, there arises the dream of
absorption in the God, and of utter devotion to his will, even as we
meet it in the suicide-seeking transports of the early Christians. <span
id="fr_373"></span>[2](#fn_373.md) And thus, on the æsthetic side of the
evolution, from the rude block of the rustic Beer-God <span
id="fr_374"></span>[3](#fn_374.md) there is ultimately fashioned, under the
hands even of the unbelieving Euripides, the gracious form of the calm
God of Joy:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">     No grudge hath he of the great;  
     No scorn of the mean estate;  
But to all that liveth His wine he giveth,  
     Griefless, immaculate. <span id="fr_375"></span>[4](#fn_375.md)</span>

</div>

<span id="page_98">p. 98</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> And even such a
mystery as Hellenic hands wrought out of the hypostasis of the Beer-God,
Hellenistic hands could shape from that of a man of sorrows, moulding
from the sombre figure of the human sacrifice, slain a million times
through æons of ignorance, a God of another and a more enduring cast. In
the understanding of this secondary process lies the comprehension of
the history of what may be conveniently termed "culture-religion" as
distinguished from the "Nature religion" studied under the head of
anthropology. In terms of this distinction we may say that hierology
proper begins with the typically secondary Gods, where anthropology in
the ordinary sense ends. <span id="fr_376"></span>[1](#fn_376.md) But it is
essential to a scientific view that we remember there has been no break
in the evolution, no supernatural or enigmatic interposition; and this
will be sufficiently clear when we study the evolution of the secondary
Gods in detail.

suffer, in common with him," and that this led to the satyric element in
the festivals. Haigh (*Tragic Drama of the Greeks*, 1896, p. 21) points
out that the satyric chorus was anything but devotional, and that the
temper in question belonged to "the orgiastic worship of Dionysos, as
performed by ecstatic Mœnads at Thebes and Delphi, where the dominant
note, undoubtedly, was one of agonised sympathy with the sufferings of
the God." Cp. Miss Harrison, *Prolegomena to the Study of Greek
