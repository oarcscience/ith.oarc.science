#### § 4. Evolution of Mithra.

Putting aside as otherwise insoluble the problem of "Zoroastrianism,"
and recognising that that system and the special cult of Mithra were
originally separate but probably fused by some conquest, <span
id="fr_1434"></span>[4](#fn_1434.md) we proceed to note that the
Mithra-cult, both in this connection and later, underwent an evolution
in which the God's status slowly fluctuated, or was readjusted, like
that of so many other ancient deities. For a time (and this suggests a
Zoroastrian influence) he was graded as the subordinate of Ahura-Mazda
(Ormazd).

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"In the Indo-Iranian religion" \[M. Darmesteter
writes <span id="fr_1435"></span>[5](#fn_1435.md)\] "the Asura of Heaven
was often invoked in company with Mithra, the God of the heavenly light;
and he let him share with himself the universal sovereignty. In the Veda
they are invoked as a pair (Mitrâ-Varunâ) which enjoys the same powers
and rights as Varunâ alone, as there is nothing more in Mari), Varunâ
than in Varunâ alone, Mitra being the light of heaven, that is, the
light of Varunâ. But Ahura-Mazda could no longer bear an equal, and
Mithra \[in the Avesta\] became one of his</span>

</div>

<span id="page_289">p. 289</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

creatures: 'This Mithra, the lord of wide pastures, I have created as
worthy of sacrifice, as worthy of glorification, as I, Ahura-Mazda, am
myself.' <span id="fr_1436"></span>[1](#fn_1436.md) But old formulæ, no
longer understood, in which Mithra and Ahura, or rather Mithra-Ahura,
are invoked in an indivisible unity, dimly remind one that the Creator
was formerly a brother to his creature."

"He preserved, however, a high situation, both in the concrete and in
the abstract mythology. As the God of the heavenly light, the lord of
vast luminous space, of the wide pastures above, he became later the God
of the Sun, *Deo invicto Soli Mithræ* (in Persian *Mihr* is the Sun). As
light and truth were one and the same thing, viewed with the eyes of the
body and of the mind, he becomes the God of truth and faith. He punishes
the Mithra-Drug, 'him who lies to Mithra' (or 'who lies to the
contract,' since Mithra as a neuter noun means 'friendship, agreement,
contract' <span id="fr_1437"></span>[2](#fn_1437).md); he is a judge in
hell, in company with Rashnu, 'the true one,' the God of truth, a mere
offshoot of Mithra in his moral character." <span
id="fr_1438"></span>[3](#fn_1438.md)

</div>

The ritual of the Avesta is clear on the subject. "We sacrifice unto
Mithra and Ahura, the two great, imperishable, holy Gods; and unto the
stars, and the moon, and the sun, with the trees that yield up baresma"
\[burned on the altar\]. "We sacrifice unto Mithra, the lord of all
countries, whom Ahura-Mazda made the most glorious of all the Gods in
the world unseen." "So may Mithra and Ahura, the two great Gods, come to
us for help. We sacrifice unto the bright, undying, shining,
swift-horsed sun." <span id="fr_1439"></span>[4](#fn_1439.md) And in the
teaching associated with Zoroaster we find Mithra extolled by
Ahura-Mazda as a beneficent and comforting Spirit. "Happy that man, I
think"—said Ahura-Mazda—"O Spitama Zarathustra! for whom a holy
priest......who is the Word Incarnate, offers up a sacrifice unto
Mithra......Straight to that man, I think, will Mithra come, to visit
his dwelling. When Mithra's boons will come to him, as he follows God's
teaching, and thinks according to God's teaching." <span
id="fr_1440"></span>[5](#fn_1440.md) This, though still ancient, was
doubtless a relatively late and high form of the cultus in Persia, since
in the Avesta we find Mithra repeatedly invoked as a warlike and
formidable deity, a God of battles, swift to assail and slay the enemies
of truth and justice—which would normally mean, the enemies of his
worshippers.

<span id="page_290">p. 290</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> But the evolution
of a moral cult on such a basis was in the due course of religious
adaptation, since in the Mahâbhârata Agni combines the same set of
characteristics, being at once friendly to warriors and typified by a
dove, while as the Mouth of the Gods he fulfils the highest moral
functions. <span id="fr_1441"></span>[1](#fn_1441.md)

Thus, then, we have the cultus of Mithra as the Sun-God, the deity of
light and truth, created by, and yet co-equal with, the Supreme
Deity, <span id="fr_1442"></span>[2](#fn_1442.md) and fighting on the side
of the good against the evil power Angra-Mainyu (Ahriman)—this at a
period long before the Christian era. So much is certain, whatever we
may decide as to the actual period of the writing of the Avesta, as it
has come down to us. Of the literature of Mazdeism, of course, a great
deal has perished; this appearing, says M. Darmesteter, not only from
internal evidence, but from history.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"The Arab conquest proved fatal to the religious
literature of the Sassanian ages, a great part of which was either
destroyed by the fanaticism of the conquerors and the new converts, or
lost during the long exodus of the Parsis The cause that preserved the
Avesta is obvious: taken as a whole, it does not profess to be a
religious encyclopædia, but only a liturgical collection: and it bears
more likeness to a prayer-book than to the Bible." <span
id="fr_1443"></span>[3](#fn_1443.md)</span>

</div>

We can therefore only infer the nature of the rest of the system. But we
do know that, as time went on, the cultus of Mithra became more and more
considerable. It is hardly accurate to say, as does Canon Rawlinson,
that "Mithra was originally not held in very high esteem"; but it is the
historic fact that

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"he ultimately came to occupy a place only a little
inferior to that assigned, from the first, to the Ahura-Mazda. Darius,
the son of Hystaspes, placed the emblems of Ahura-Mazda and of Mithra in
equally conspicuous positions on the sculptured tablet above his tomb
\[B.C. 485\]; and his example was followed by all the later monarchs of
his race whose sepulchres are still in existence. Artaxerxes Mnemon
\[*d*. B.C. 358\] placed an image of Mithra in the temple attached to
the royal palace of Suza. He also in his inscriptions unites Mithra with
Ahura-Mazda, and</span>

</div>

<span id="page_291">p. 291</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">prays for their conjoint protection. Artaxerxes
Ochus \[*d*. B.C. 337\] does the same a little later; and the practice
is also observed in portions of the Zendavesta composed about this
period." <span id="fr_1444"></span>[1](#fn_1444.md)</span>

</div>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Artaxerxes Mnemon,
too, swore by "the light of Mithras," as our William the Conqueror swore
by "the splendour of God"; <span id="fr_1445"></span>[2](#fn_1445.md) and
in general the importance and range of the Mithraic worship at an early
period may be clearly inferred from the mere vogue of the name
Mithridates, "the justice of Mithra," which we find in use at least six
hundred years before the Christian era. <span
id="fr_1446"></span>[3](#fn_1446.md)

It is after the Persian conquest of Babylon (538 B.C.) that Mithraism
begins to take the shape it wears in the period of the Roman empire.
Though historical details are lacking, we are broadly entitled to say
that "the Mazdeism of the Persians, in uniting with the astrolatry of
the Chaldeans, produced Mithraism." <span
id="fr_1447"></span>[4](#fn_1447.md) It was presumably before this
development that Mazdeism entered Armenia under the earlier
Achamenidæ, <span id="fr_1448"></span>[5](#fn_1448.md) who conquered that
region about 625 B.C.; for whereas Ahuramazda, the Supreme God, was in
some measure superseded by Mithra in the later Mithraic cult, <span
id="fr_1449"></span>[6](#fn_1449.md) in virtue of the same psychological
tendency that later gave to the Christian Jesus a nominal equality with
and a practical precedence over Yahweh, we find the older Mazdean deity
adored as the thundering God in Eastern Iberia as late as the fourth
century. <span id="fr_1450"></span>[7](#fn_1450.md) But Mithraism in turn
was prepared in Armenia for its cosmopolitan career in the western
world; since it was from Armenian Mazdeism that it borrowed its
enigmatic "supreme God," Kronos-Zervan, the Time Spirit, a Babylonian
conception, represented in the mysteries by the lion-headed or
demon-headed and serpent-encircled

<span id="page_292">p. 292</span>

figure which bears the two keys. <span id="fr_1451"></span>[1](#fn_1451.md)
And this deity in turn tells of Babylonian influence, since the
conception of the two locked doors of exit and entrance in the firmament
is of Babylonian origin. <span id="fr_1452"></span>[2](#fn_1452.md)

We must not exclude, however, the possibility that certain features of
the Mithraic cult derive equally with those of some Babylonian cults
from a common source of great antiquity. Mithra partly equates with Bel
or Enlil, who seems to have been originally a War-God of "mighty
weapons," and was known as "lord of lands," <span
id="fr_1453"></span>[3](#fn_1453.md) even as Mithra is "lord of wide
pastures" and "all countries" and a bearer of "glorious weapons"; yet
these seem to be early and not late attributes of Mithra. Bel, again,
gives place to Merodach (Marduk), who assumes his titles and who becomes
the Mediator-God; <span id="fr_1454"></span>[4](#fn_1454.md) but this
evolution in Mithra's case may follow older lines; even as his
bracketing with Ahura-Mazda, as Bel was bracketed with Anu, <span
id="fr_1455"></span>[5](#fn_1455.md) appears to be early and not late. New
Year's day is the festival alike of Bel, Merodach, and Mithra: this is
an ancient idea. <span id="fr_1456"></span>[6](#fn_1456.md) Yet again, when
we find the Babylonian Sun-God and War-God Shamas (the prototype of the
Hebrew "judge" Samson) figuring especially as the Judge and the Saviour
of men, the destroyer of the wicked and of the enemies of his
worshippers, <span id="fr_1457"></span>[7](#fn_1457.md) we need not suppose
that Mithra, who has all these attributes, is primarily modelled on
Shamas, though he was identified with him: <span
id="fr_1458"></span>[8](#fn_1458.md) the underlying concept is prior to
both cults. On the other hand, when Mithra absorbs in himself the idea
of the *Logos*—who for the Babylonians is a separate God, Nabu, the
rival of Merodach <span id="fr_1459"></span>[9](#fn_1459.md) (as the Logos
Hermes for the Greeks is the rival of Apollo), but later bracketed with
him as his son <span id="fr_1460"></span>[10](#fn_1460.md)—we may
reasonably suppose that the Mithraic adaptation is late.

Of the deity thus shaped through many centuries, by many forces, it
seems warrantable to say that his cult was normally in an ethically
advanced stage, relatively to contemporary worships. In remote times,
doubtless, he was worshipped with human sacrifices, like most other
Gods: the Persian practice of sacrificing on a "high place" <span
id="fr_1461"></span>[11](#fn_1461.md) tells of early connection with the
Asiatic cult of pyramid-altar-temples, which spread to Polynesia, North
America, Syria,

<span id="page_293">p. 293</span>

and Greece, always in connection with sacrifices of men and children. Of
such sacrifice there is no trustworthy trace in the historic period,
however, and at no time do we find any trace in his legend of sexual
complications. Unlike Agni, unlike Krishna and Apollo and Adonis and
Herakles and Dionysos and Attis, he has no amours; and his conjunction
with Anaitis or Anahid, as we shall see, seems to have been rather a
mystical blending of sexes than a conjugal union. His mate appears to
have been primarily Ardivisura, a Goddess of a sacred well, and of the
earth-waters generally, later blended with the Semitic Anahid, a Goddess
of fruitfulness. <span id="fr_1462"></span>[1](#fn_1462.md) At times he may
have been licentiously worshipped, <span
id="fr_1463"></span>[2](#fn_1463.md) as Anaitis was; <span
id="fr_1464"></span>[3](#fn_1464.md) but in the Avesta and in the developed
cultus so far as we know it he is always shown as making for
righteousness. <span id="fr_1465"></span>[4](#fn_1465.md)

Theologically, he exists both in abstract and in symbol. Originally, he
is simply the animised sun: later, according to the universal law of
religious evolution, he becomes a spirit apart from the sun but
symbolised by it, the sun being worshipped in his name, and he being the
God who sustains it: nay, an actual subordinate Sun-God takes his place,
even in the Rig Veda. <span id="fr_1466"></span>[5](#fn_1466.md) But since
in Persian, as we have seen, his name (*Mihr*) actually means the
sun, <span id="fr_1467"></span>[6](#fn_1467.md) he can never be dissociated
from it; and as the same word also means "the friend," the light being
the friend of man, <span id="fr_1468"></span>[7](#fn_1468.md) and seems to
connote love or amity, <span id="fr_1469"></span>[8](#fn_1469.md) a moral
distinction inevitably attaches to him in a stage of thought in which
words have an incalculable significance. He is not a mere benefactor to
be flattered. As the sun in Nature can both succour and slay; as Apollo,
called by Pindar <span id="fr_1470"></span>[9](#fn_1470.md) the most
friendly to men of all the Gods, is also the Destroyer, so the Persians
sang: "Thou, O Mithra, art both bad and good to nations"—and to
men, <span id="fr_1471"></span>[10](#fn_1471.md) At length, the dualist
theory holding its ground as a theological system, as it always will
while

<span id="page_294">p. 294</span>

men personify the energies of the universe, Mithra comes to occupy a
singular position as between the two great powers of good and evil,
Ormazd and Ahriman (the Ahura-Mazda and Angra-Mainyu of Mazdeism)—being
actually named the <span class="smallcaps">Mediator</span>, <span
id="fr_1472"></span>[1](#fn_1472.md) and figuring to the devout eye as a
humane and beneficent God, nearer to man <span
id="fr_1473"></span>[2](#fn_1473.md) than the Great Spirit of Good, a
Saviour, a Redeemer, eternally young, son of the Most High, <span
id="fr_1474"></span>[3](#fn_1474.md) and preserver of mankind from the Evil
One. In brief, he is a pagan Christ.

Much has been written as to whether Mithra was worshipped as the sun, or
as the creator and sustainer of the sun. There can be no reasonable
doubt that the two ideas existed, and were often blended. <span
id="fr_1475"></span>[4](#fn_1475.md) We may depend upon it that for the
weak and ignorant minds, which could conceive a personal God only under
the form of a man or animal, or both combined, the perpetual pageant of
the sun was a help and not a hindrance to elevation of thought. We can
understand, too, how even to the thinkers, who sought to distinguish
between matter and essence, and reckoned the sun only a part of the
material universe, the great orb should yet be the very symbol of life
and splendour and immortality, as well as the chosen seat of the deity
who ruled mankind; and that it should be the viewless spirit of the sun
who, in their thought, proclaimed to man the oracle of the Soul of the
Universe: "*I* am the Alpha and the Omega, the first and the last, which
is, and which was, and which is to come, the Almighty." <span

<span id="fn_1468"></span>[293:7](pch65.htm#fr_1468.md) Mitra literally
means "a friend"; it is the light as friendly to man. Cp. Darmesteter,
*Ormazd et Ahriman*, §9 59-61; Max Müller. Hibbert Lectures, 2nd ed. p.
268, *note*.

Oriental, and Classical Antiquities*. 1823, p. 194, citing the *Berhan-ĭ
Katteā*. The name seems to have been the Persian equivalent of Eros.

<span id="fn_1472"></span>[294:1](pch65.htm#fr_1472.md) Plutarch, *Isis and
Osiris*, c. 46; Julian, *In regem solem*, cc. 9, 10, 21. Lesser spirits,
of course, were also held to exercise mediatorial functions, like the
Christian Saints. "The Furuhers of the ancient Persians were
intermediate agents between God and man, who presented earthly petitions
to the throne of Ormuzd, being connected with the human soul and
attendants on it." Wait, *Jewish, Oriental, and Classical Antiquities*,
1823, p. 88, citing the *Berhan-ĭ Katteā*. Cp. Spiegel, *Avesta*,
Einleitung, p. 31. For the metaphysical development of the idea of the
Sun-God as Mediator see Julian, *In regem solem*.

<span id="fn_1473"></span>[294:2](pch65.htm#fr_1473.md) In the Persian
mythology the first man and woman, Mashya and Mashyana, arise on
Mithra's day in Mithra's (the seventh) month. (Spiegel, *Erânische
Alterthumskunde*, 1, 503, 511.) In the Persian myth the pair are at
first not only sinless but alike sexless (*Bundahish*, xv).

<span id="fn_1474"></span>[294:3](pch65.htm#fr_1474.md) "Like all the Aryan
religions, that of the ancient Persians admitted that Ahura Mazda was a
husband and father." Cumont, *Textes et Monuments*, i, 137. M. Cumont
need not have limited this characteristic to the Aryan systems; it is
equally Semitic. But it is in the later stages of Mithraism that the
Sonship of the God is stressed. *Id*. ii, 4-5.

<span id="fn_1475"></span>[294:4](pch65.htm#fr_1475.md) Cp. Tiele,
*Egyptian Religion*, p. 44, as to Osiris, and Hillebrandt, as cited
above, p. 290, *note*, as to Mitra. One of the many proposed corrections
of Gibbon by his commentators which are themselves errors is Guizot's
note on ch. viii (Bohn ed. i, 255 to the effect that "Mithra was not the
sun." Guizot founded on Anquetil, who, though a great pioneer, had not
fully mastered the records.

<span id="fn_1476"></span>[294:5](pch65.htm#fr_1476.md) Revelation, i, 8;
xxi, 6; xxii, 13. A very ancient Pagan formula. See Pausanias, x, 12, as
to the chant "Zeus was, Zeus is, Zeus shall be"; and the phrase "God the
beginning and the end," in Plato, *Laws*, iv, 7. Cp., in the Egyptian
"Book of the Dead" (ch. lxiv; Budge's trans. pp. 112, 116), the formula,
"I am Yesterday, To-day, and To-morrow."
