#### § 3. Polytheism and Monotheism.

Broadly speaking, religious evolution is far from being a steady
progress, and, such as it is, is determined in great measure by
political and social change. It was certainly a political process, for
instance, that established a nominal monotheism among the Hebrews in
Palestine; even as it was a political process that established a
systematic polytheism in other States. <span
id="fr_255"></span>[1](#fn_255.md) Primarily, all tribes and cities
probably tended to worship specially a God, ancestral or otherwise, who
was the "Luck" of the community and was at first nameless, or only
generically named. Later comparison and competition evolved names; and
any association of tribes meant as a matter of course a pantheon, the
women of each taking their deities with them when they married into
another clan. Ferocious myths and theological historiography in the
Hebrew books tell amply of the anxiety of the priests of Yahweh at a
comparatively late stage to resist this natural drift of things; and the
history, down to the Captivity, avows their utter failure.

Neither in the attempt nor in its failure is there anything out of the
ordinary way of religious evolution. While some theorists (with Renan)
credit Israel with a unique bias to monotheism, others,

<span id="page_67">p. 67</span>

unable to see how Israel could be thus unique, infer either an early
debt to the higher monotheistic thought of Egypt or (with Ewald) an
original reaction on the part of Moses against Egyptian polytheism. All
three inferences are gratuitous. Renan's thesis that a special bias to
monotheism was set up in the early Semites by their environment is
contradicted by all their ancient history, and is now abandoned by
theologians. <span id="fr_256"></span>[1](#fn_256.md) The story of Moses in
Egypt is a flagrant fiction; and "Moab, Ammon, and Edom, Israel's
nearest kinsfolk and neighbours, were monotheists in precisely the same
sense in which Israel itself was" <span
id="fr_257"></span>[2](#fn_257.md)—that is to say, they too had special
tribal Gods whom their priests sought to aggrandise. There is no reason
to doubt that such priests fought for their Baals as Yahwists did for
Yahweh. The point of differentiation in Israel is not any specialty of
consciousness, but the specialty of evolution ultimately set up in their
case through the conquest of Babylon by Cyrus.

All the earlier Palestinian groups tended to be monotheistic and
polytheistic in the same way. When tribes formally coalesced in a city
or made a chief, a chief God was likely to be provided by the
"paramount" tribe or cult, <span id="fr_258"></span>[3](#fn_258.md) unless
he were framed out of the local fact of the city, or the mere principle
of alliance. <span id="fr_259"></span>[4](#fn_259.md) In the case of the
Hebrews, the cult of Yah, or Yahu, or Yahweh, was simply a local worship
sometimes aggrandised by the King, and documentally imposed on the
fictitious history of the nation long afterwards. <span
id="fr_260"></span>[5](#fn_260.md) In the miscellaneous so-called
prophecies ascribed to Jeremiah there is overwhelming testimony to the
boundless polytheism of the people even in Jerusalem, the special seat
of Yahweh, just before the Captivity. Either these documents preserve
the historic facts or they were composed by Yahwists to terrorise yet a
later generation of Hebrew polytheists. Not till a long series of
political pressures and convulsions had eliminated the variant stocks
and forces, and built up a special fanaticism for one cult, did an
ostensible monotheism really hold the ground in the sacred city. <span
id="fr_261"></span>[6](#fn_261.md)

<span id="page_68">p. 68</span>

That this monotheism was "religious" in the arbitrary and unscientific
sense of being neither ethical nor philosophical it might seem needless
to deny; but the truth is that it represents the ethic of a priesthood
seeking its own ends. The main thesis of the prophetic and historical
books is simply the barbaric doctrine that Yahweh is the God of Israel,
whom he sought to make "a people unto *him*"*;* that Israel's sufferings
are a punishment for worshipping the Gods of other peoples; and that
Yahweh effects the punishment by employing as his instruments those
other peoples, who, if Yahweh be the one true God, are just as guilty as
Israel. There is here, obviously, no monotheism properly so-called, even
when the rival Gods are called non-Gods. <span
id="fr_262"></span>[1](#fn_262.md) Such an expression does not occur in the
reputedly early writings; and when first employed it is but a form of
bluster natural to warring communities at a certain stage of zealotry;
it is known to have been employed by the Assyrians and Egyptians as
spontaneously as by the Hebrews; <span id="fr_263"></span>[2](#fn_263.md)
and it stands merely for the stress of cultivated fanaticism in
priest-taught communities. The idea that Yahweh used other nations as
the "rod of his anger" against Israel and Judah, without desiring to be
worshipped by those other nations, is a mere verbal semblance of holding
him for the only God; and arises by simple extension of the habit of
seeing a chastisement from the tribe's God in any trouble that came upon
it.

Here we are listening to a lesson given by priests. On the other hand,
the politic course of conciliating the Gods of the foe, practised by the
senate-ruled Romans, tells of the grafting of the principle of sheer
worldly or military prudence on that of general religious credulity in a
community where priesthood as such was but slightly developed. Morally
and rationally speaking, however, there is no difference of plane
between the Roman and the Hebrew conceptions. <span
id="fr_264"></span>[3](#fn_264.md) Jeremiah, proclaiming that "the showers
have been withheld" by "the Lord that giveth rain," <span
id="fr_265"></span>[4](#fn_265.md) is on that side, indeed, at the
intellectual level of any tribal medicine-man; and if the writers of
such doctrine could really have believed what their words

<span id="page_69">p. 69</span>

at times implied, that the alleged one sole God desired the devotion of
Israel alone, leaving all other peoples to the worship of chimæras, they
would have been not above but below the intellectual and moral level of
the professed polytheists around them.

On any view, indeed, they were morally lower in that they were
potentially less sympathetic. So far as can be historically gathered,
the early monotheistic idea, so-called, arose by way of an angry refusal
to say, what the earlier Yahwists *had* constantly said and believed,
that other nations had their Gods like Israel. There is thus only a
quibbling truth in the thesis that monotheism does not grow out of
polytheism, but out of an "inchoate monotheism" which is the germ of
polytheism and monotheism alike. <span id="fr_266"></span>[1](#fn_266.md)
The "inchoate monotheism" in question being simply the worship of one
special tribal God, is itself actually evolved from a prior polytheism,
for the conception of a single national God is relatively late, and even
that of a tribal God emerges while men believe in many ungraded Gods. It
is quite true that later polytheism arises by the collocation of tribal
Gods; but there is absolutely no known case of a monotheism which did
not emerge in a people who normally admitted the existence of a
multitude of Gods. Even, then, if the first assertors of a Sole God were
so in virtue of a special intuition, that intuition was certainly
developed in a polytheistic life. And there is absolutely no reason to
doubt, on the other hand, that in Israel as elsewhere there were men who
reached monotheism by philosophic progression from polytheism.

The historic evolution of Jewish monotheism, however, was certainly not
of this order. It was not even, as Robertson Smith with much candour of
intention implied, "nothing more than a consequence of the alliance of
religion with monarchy." <span id="fr_267"></span>[2](#fn_267.md) Monarchy
in Mesopotamia and Egypt never induced monotheism; and most of the
Jewish kings were on the face of the record polytheists. The
development, as we shall see, was post-monarchic and hierocratic; and
the immediate question is whether the spirit which promoted it was
either morally or intellectually superior. The judicial answer must be
that it was not. Insofar as it was a sincere fanaticism, a fixed idea
that one God alone was to be recognised, though he devoted himself to
one small group of men, it partook of the nature of mono- mania, since
it utterly excluded any deep or scrupulous reflection on

<span id="page_70">p. 70</span>

human problems; and insofar as it was not fanatical it was simply the
sinister self-assertion of priests bent on establishing their monopoly.

The contrary view, that a belief in the existence of the Gods of other
tribes than one's own is "obviously" a "*lower* form of faith than that
of the man who worships only one god and believes that as for the gods
of the heathen, they are but idols," <span
id="fr_268"></span>[1](#fn_268.md) must just be left to the strengthening
moral sense of men. Such an assumption necessarily leads, in
consistency, to the thesis that the man who believes his tribe has the
One God all to itself does so in virtue of a unique "revelation"; and
this is implied in the further description of true monotheism as
proceeding on an "inner consciousness that the object of man's worship
is one and indivisible, one and the same God always." On this basis,
sheer stress of egoism is the measure of religiosity; and as the mere
scientific reason cannot suppose such egoism to have been a monopoly of
the Hebrews, it would follow, for ordinary minds, that revelation
occurred in every separate cult in the world. It is indeed certain that
even among polytheists a special absorption in the thought of one God is
a common phenomenon. <span id="fr_269"></span>[2](#fn_269.md) Thus there
are as many revelations as there are Gods and Goddesses, all alike being
vouched for by the "spiritual depths of man's nature."

Unless rational thought is once more to be bridled by absolutism, such a
line of reasoning must be classed with the pretensions of the medieval
papacy. Men not already committed to dogma cannot conceive that a
religion is to be appraised in utter disregard of its relation to
universal morals, on a mere à priori principle as to the nobility of
monotheism—especially when the principle is set up for one monotheism
alone. It is merely a conventional result of the actual course of the
evolution of the Christian system that quasi-monotheism as such should
be assumed to be an advance on other forms of creed, with or without
exception of the case of Islam. A certain intellectual gain may indeed
arise where a cult dispenses with and denounces images; this, even if
the variation arose, as is likely, not by way of positive reasoning on
the subject, but by the simple chance of conservatism in a local cult
which had subsisted long without images for sheer lack of handicraftsmen
to make them. <span id="fr_270"></span>[3](#fn_270.md)

<span id="page_71">p. 71</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> But the gain is
slight indeed when the anthropomorphic idea of the God's local residence
is stressed exactly as his imaged presence is stressed elsewhere, and
when in every other respect his worship and ethic are on the common
anthropomorphic level. <span id="fr_271"></span>[1](#fn_271.md) In any case
it is clear that such monotheism could not be made by mere asseveration,
with or without "genius," to prevail against the polytheism of a
population not politically selected on a monotheistic basis.

Even if it were, however, it would depend on further and special causes
or circumstances whether the worshippers underwent any new moral
development. <span id="fr_272"></span>[2](#fn_272.md) The conventional view
unfortunately excludes the recognition of this; hence we have the
spectacle of a prolonged dispute <span id="fr_273"></span>[3](#fn_273.md)
as to whether savage races can ever have the notion of a "Supreme Being"
or "Creator" or "High God," or "All Father," with the assumption on both
sides that if the affirmative can be formally made out the savages in
question are at once invested with a higher intellectual and spiritual
character—as if a man who chanced to call his God "High" and "Good"
thereby became good and high-thinking. <span
id="fr_274"></span>[4](#fn_274.md) All the while Mr. Lang, the chief
champion of the affirmative, avows that his Supreme-Being-worshipping
savages in Australia would kill their wives if the latter overheard the
"high" theistic and ethical doctrine of the mysteries. <span
id="fr_275"></span>[5](#fn_275.md) Even apart from such an avowal, it ought
to be unnecessary to point out that terms of moral description
translated from the language of savages to that of civilised men have a
merely classifying force, and in themselves can justify no moral
conclusion in terms of our own doctrines, any more than their use of
terms like "Creator" can be held to imply a philosophical argument as to
a "First Cause." <span id="fr_276"></span>[6](#fn_276.md)

Two moral and intellectual tests at least must be applied to any

<span id="page_72">p. 72</span>

doctrine or cult of "monotheism" before it can be graded above any form
of polytheism: we must know whether it involves a common ethic for the
community of the worshipper and other communities; and whether it sets
up a common ethic of humanity within the community. Either test may in a
given case be partially satisfied while the other is wholly unsatisfied.
Thus we have the pre-exilic Hebrews and (perhaps) some modern Australian
aborigines <span id="fr_277"></span>[1](#fn_277.md) affirming a "One God"
who is "Creator" of all, and yet treating all strangers as outside of
the God's providence or law; while on the other hand we had till
recently the Khonds, with their human sacrifices to the Goddess Tari and
their doctrine of a Supreme God, proclaiming that the victim whom they
liturgically tortured or tore to pieces was sacrificed for "the whole
world," the responsibility for its welfare having been laid on their
sect. <span id="fr_278"></span>[2](#fn_278.md) To set such "monotheism" or
such Soterism above late Greek or Roman polytheism or Hindoo pantheism
is possible only under an uncritical convention. <span
id="fr_279"></span>[3](#fn_279.md) We must try Hebrew religion by moral
tests if we are to grade it in a moral scale with others; and by such
tests it is found to be anti-moral in its very monotheism. As for its
records, we find its most impressive myths (to say nothing of the
others) duplicated among some of the primitive tribes in India in our
own day. One such tribe ascribes to a sacred bull the miracle of Joshua,
the turning back of the sun in its course; another has a legend that is
a close counterpart of that of the Exodus—the dividing of the waters by
the God to enable the tribe to escape a pursuing king. <span
id="fr_280"></span>[4](#fn_280.md)

Genius, no doubt, did arise in the shape of an occasional monotheist
with both literary gift and higher ethical and cosmical ideals than
those of the majority; and though there is reason to surmise lateness as
regards the "prophetic" teachings of that order, <span
id="fr_281"></span>[5](#fn_281.md) it is not to be disputed that such
thinkers (whom Dr. Jevons would deny to be thinkers) may have existed
early. But the broad historic fact remains that by the ostensibly latest
prophet in the canon Yahweh is represented as complaining bitterly of
the frauds committed on him in the matter of tithes and sacrifices.
"Offer it now unto thy governor: will he be pleased with thee?" he is
made to say concerning the damaged victims brought to his altar. <span
id="fr_282"></span>[6](#fn_282.md) And the very prophet of the Restoration
lays down, or is made to lay

<span id="page_73">p. 73</span>

down, the old doctrine of the tribal medicine-man very much in the
language of a modern company-promoter:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

And it shall come to pass that every one that is left of all the nations
which came against Jerusalem shall go up from year to year, to worship
the King, the Lord of hosts, and to keep the feast of tabernacles \[more
correctly *booths*\].

And it shall be that whoso of all the families of the earth goeth not up
unto Jerusalem to worship the King, the Lord of hosts, *even upon them
there shall be no rain*.

And if the family of Egypt go not up, and come not, neither shall it be
upon them; there shall be the plague \[*or* upon them shall be the
plague\] wherewith the Lord will smite the nations that go not up to
keep the feast of tabernacles. <span id="fr_283"></span>[1](#fn_283.md)

</div>

If this were the whole or the principal historical clue to the motives
of the Return, we should be moved to decide that that movement was
simply a sacro-commercial venture, undertaken by men who had seen how
much treasure was to be made by any shrine of fair repute for antiquity
and sanctity. The other records, of course, enable us to realise that
there entered into it the zeal of a zealous remnant, devoted to the
nominal cult of their fathers’ city and the memories of their race. But
with such a document before us we are forced to recognise, what we might
know from other details in sacerdotal history to be likely, that with
the zealots there went the exploiters of zealotry. It is certain that
the men of the Return were for the most part poor: a Talmudic saying
preserves the fact that those who had done well in Babylon remained
there; <span id="fr_284"></span>[2](#fn_284.md) and, on the other hand, it
holds to reason that among the less prosperous there would be some
adventurers, certainly not unbelievers, but believers in Mammon as well
as in another God.

Such men had abundant reason to believe in Yahweh as a source of
revenue. The prophetic and historic references to him as a rain-giver
are so numerous as to give a broad support to Goldziher's theory that
the God of the Hebrews had been a Rain- God first and a Sun-God only
latterly; and in sun-scorched Syria a God of Rain was as sure an
attraction as the Syrian Goddess herself, who in Lucian's day had such
treasure-yielding prestige. But even if we ignore the economic motive,
obvious as it is, the teaching of Zechariah remains undeniably tribalist
and crassly unedifying. To such doctrine as this can be attributed
neither the

<span id="page_74">p. 74</span>

intellectual nor the moral advantages theoretically associated with
monotheism in culture-history. It is historically certain that science
never made in Jewry any such progress as the monotheistic conception has
been supposed to promote; and whatever general elevation of moral
thought may have taken place among the teachers of later Jewry is
clearly to be ascribed not to a fortuitous upcrop of genius—though that
was not absent—but to the chastening effect of disaster and frustration,
forcing men to deep reverie and the gathering of the wisdom of sadness.
And to this they may have been in a measure helped by the higher ethical
teachings current among their polytheistic conquerors and neighbours.
There emerges the not discomforting thought that it is from suffering
and the endurance of wrong, not from triumph and prosperity, that men
have reached an ideal in religion which renounces all the egoisms of
race and cult. Such an experience could have come to other victims of
Babylon, brought within the Babylonian world before the Jews. But the
trouble was that only there could a wisdom of self-renunciation subsist
in any communal shape: in the Hebrew books, however introduced, it was
forever doubled with the lore of savagery and tribalism, the worst
religious ethic always jostling the best.

challenge.

Kuenen notes (*Religion of Israel*, Eng. tr. i, 51-52), such passages
are few in the prophetic books. In Hosea xiii, 4, there is no such
implication; and the "non-God" passages are all presumptively late. The
Aramaic verse, Jer. x, 11, is an interpolation; and the whole chapter is
relatively late.

we could believe the awful tales of God-commanded massacres told in the
Hexateuch, we should have to place the "Mosaic" Hebrews on a level with
the most cruel savages of whom we have any record. The priests who
compiled these hideous fables were doing their best to sink Hebrew life

polytheism," writes J. G. Müller (*Amerik. Urrelig.* p. 19), "diverge
not through grade the Godhead but through difference of principle,
through the primarily different relation to the Godhead. From polytheism
nations emerged not by mounting on the same ladder, by leaving it, by
the inception of a new spiritual force (*Geistes schöpfung*)."

<span id="fn_270"></span>[70:3](pch21.htm#fr_270.md) That Yahweh was,
however, imaged in northern Israel as a young bull—a symbolic form
common to him and Moloch—is beyond doubt. Cp. Kuenen, *Religion of
Israel*, 1, 235-6. Here the Yahwists probably adopted images made by
more advanced races. Cp. on the other hand Goldziher's theory that the
early Hebrews worshipped the night sky and the cloudy sky—objects not
adaptable to images (*Mythology among the Hebrews*, Eng. tr. pp.
220-227).

<span id="fn_271"></span>[71:1](pch21.htm#fr_271.md) The barbarous Khonds,
who till recently practised human sacrifice, rejected both images and
temples as absurd; and the cults of the Maories, though not imageless,
as is stated by Macpherson (*Memorials of Service in India*, p. 102),
made small account of images as such. They were in fact treated as being
in themselves nothing, being "only thought to possess virtue or peculiar
sanctity from the presence of the God they represented when dressed up
for worship" (Rev. R. Taylor, *Te Ika a Maui*, 1870, pp. 211-214). They
were thus in the strict sense fetishes. But the Khonds are without
durable houses (*Id*. p. 61); and they and the Maories alike were of
course backward in the arts. In Fiji a similar state of things prevailed
(Seeman, in Galton's *Vacation Tourists*, 1862, p. 269). As to the Vedic
Aryans there is debate, Max Müller holding them to have had no idols
(Chips, i, 38), while Muir cites texts which seem to imply that they had
them (*Original Sanskrit Texts*, v. 453-4).

<span id="fn_272"></span>[71:2](pch21.htm#fr_272.md) Prof. A. Réville, a

que la divinité n’est, en réalité, ni masculine ni féminine, qu’elle
possède les deux sexes ou n’en possède aucun. De là des symboles
monstrueux, des mutilations, ou des impuretés indescriptibles"
(*Prolégomènes de l’histoire des religions*, 3e édit. p. 172).

Mr. Lang's *Magic and Religion*, as against Dr. Tylor, who has latterly
taken up the negative position. Mr. Lang's thesis is discussed in the
author's *Studies in Religious Fallacy*, and in *Christianity and
Mythology*, 2nd ed. pp. 46-68. Like that of Dr. Jevons, Mr. Lang's view
has much in common with the teaching of Prof. Max Müller, which is
closely criticised by Mr. Spencer in App. B. to vol. i of his
*Principles of Sociology*, Some of Mr. Spencer's own arguments there
are, however, open to rebuttal.
