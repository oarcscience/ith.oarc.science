#### § 7. The Mexican White Christ.

Two sets of phenomena tell of the presence among the Aztecs of that
instinct of humanity or spirit of reason which elsewhere gradually
delivered men from the demoralisation of human sacrifice. One was the
practice, already noted, of substituting a symbol for the sacrificed
victim; the other was the cultus of the relatively benign deity
Quetzalcoatl, a God of the Toltecs whom the Aztecs had subdued. There is
no more striking figure in American mythology.

The name appears to have meant "the feathered \[or coloured\] serpent,"
and this was one of his symbols; but he was normally represented by the
red-billed sparrow-head, which in Mexican hieroglyphics stands for the
air; and his third symbol, the Firestone, had the same
significance. <span id="fr_1927"></span>[3](#fn_1927.md) As God of the Air,
accordingly, he ranks in the pantheon. <span
id="fr_1928"></span>[4](#fn_1928.md) But his mythus has a uniquely ethical
stamp, and a certain wistful pathos. <span
id="fr_1929"></span>[5](#fn_1929.md) It tells that he was once high-priest
at Tula, in Anahuac, where, ever clothed in white, he founded a cultus,
and gave beneficent laws to men, teaching them also the arts of
agriculture, metal-work, stone-cutting, and civil government; the while
a king named Huemac held with him the secular rule, and framed the law
book of the nation. But the God Tezcatlipoca came to earth in the guise
of a young merchant, who deceived the king's daughter, and again in the
guise of an old man, who persuaded Quetzalcoatl to drink a mystic drink,
whereupon he was seized with an irresistible impulse to wander away. And
so he went south-eastwards, setting up his institutions in place after
place, but always going further, till at length he disappeared in the
east, with a promise to return. For that return his worshippers ever
looked longingly, and the Aztec kings with fear, till when

<span id="page_371">p. 371</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Cortès came all
thought that he was the God, and at Cholula the people sacrificed a man
to him, and daubed him with the blood in the regulation way. <span
id="fr_1930"></span>[1](#fn_1930.md)

But in the myth of Quetzalcoatl it is told that at Tula he had preached
against human sacrifices, telling men to offer to the Gods only fruits
and flowers; and that he could not endure the thought of war, closing
his ears when men spoke of it. A similar doctrine is associated with the
traditionary worship of the rival God Votan, the legendary founder of
the Maya civilisation; <span id="fr_1931"></span>[2](#fn_1931.md) and it
may be that in both cases there is a reversion to the memory of simpler
and kindlier cults. In any case, this humane legend figures for us a
late product of Toltec feeling, representing at once the aspiration for
a better religion and the memory of the Toltec people, whose polity had
been step by step driven to the south-east by the stronger power of the
Aztecs. <span id="fr_1932"></span>[3](#fn_1932.md) It may have been some of
the Toltec priests who remained under Aztec rule that framed the gentle
mythus, <span id="fr_1933"></span>[4](#fn_1933.md) and so dreamed for
themselves a Messiah, as so many conquered races had done before. On
analysis, it appears that Huemac was really the old Toltec name of the
God, and that he took that of Quetzalcoatl in one of his more southerly
resting-places, when he became symbolised as the serpent. <span
id="fr_1934"></span>[5](#fn_1934.md) Of old he had had human sacrifices
like other Gods; and in the Aztec lands he had them still. <span
id="fr_1935"></span>[6](#fn_1935.md) But some of his white-robed priests,
left victimless till they recoiled from the bloody rites of their
conquerors, felt that their God must have a different nature from that
of the Gods of the black-robed priests of Tezcatlipoca and
Huitzilopochtli, and so framed for his cult a new gospel. <span
id="fr_1936"></span>[7](#fn_1936.md)

Recognising this, Dr. Müller and Dr. Brinton and Dr. Réville agree that
Quetzalcoatl is properly the God of the beneficent rain-bringing
east-wind, identified with the vanquished Toltec people, so that like
them he is driven away by the enmity of other deities, but, like the
vanishing or slain Sun-God of all mythologies, he is to return again in
power and great glory. By such a myth Christians are set vaguely
surmising a debt to their own legend; but there is no such thing in the
case. As Mr. Bancroft observes, following

<span id="page_372">p. 372</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Dr. Müller, <span
id="fr_1937"></span>[1](#fn_1937.md) the process is one which has occurred
in many mythologies:—"It is everywhere the case among savages, with
their national God, that the latter is a nature-deity, who becomes
gradually transformed into a national God, then into a national King,
high-priest, founder of a religion, and at last ends in being considered
a human being. The older and purer the civilisation of a people is, the
easier it is to recognise the original essence of its national God, in
spite of all transformations and disguises. So it is here. Behind the
human form of the God glimmers the nature-shape, and the national God is
known by, perhaps, all his worshippers as also a nature-deity. From his
powerful influence upon nature, he might also be held as creator. The
pure human form of this God \[Quetzalcoatl\] as it appears in the fable,
as well as in the image, is not the original, but the youngest. His
oldest concrete forms are taken from nature, to which he originally
belongs, and have maintained themselves in many attributes. All these
symbolise him as the God of fertility, chiefly......by means of the
beneficial influence of the air." <span
id="fr_1938"></span>[2](#fn_1938.md)

What is specially interesting is that, despite the inner hostility of
the Quetzalcoatl cult to those of the Mexican Gods, his stood in high
honour; <span id="fr_1939"></span>[3](#fn_1939.md) and while some of his
devotees sacrificed and ate his representative once a year in the usual
manner, some of his priests, of whom the chief also bore his name as
representing him, <span id="fr_1940"></span>[4](#fn_1940.md) did as little
sacrificing as they could, evidently finding some support in that
course. <span id="fr_1941"></span>[5](#fn_1941.md) We are moved to ask,
then, whether there was here a culture-force that could have
countervailed the host of the priests of slaughter had the Aztecs been
left to work out their own salvation. The more the problem is pondered,
however, the less probable will it seem that the humaner teaching could
have so triumphed. Conquest by some other American people might have
served to restrain the religion of blood; but there is no sign that the
humaner cult was as such making serious headway. The Aztec priesthood
like every other had an economic basis; its higher offices were the
perquisites of certain aristocratic families; and the habit of perpetual
bloodshed had atrophied the feelings of the priestly army on that}

<span id="page_373">p. 373</span>

side. Beyond a certain point, priesthoods are incapable of intellectual
regeneration from within, even if reformative ideas be present.

Williams, *Fiji and the Fijians*, i, 231. He is supposed to have been
shrined or incarnated in a man, which for his priests made human flesh
taboo.

but neither argues the point; and in his *Researches into the Early
History of Mankind* (1865, pp. 151-4), Dr. Tylor treats the matter as
pure myth. It was this deity who was long ago identified with St. Thomas
(Clavigero, B. vi, § 4, p. 250). For the myth see Dr. Brinton, *American
Hero Myths*, pp. 73-142. In the ritual of the confessional he is called
"the father and mother" of the penitent (Sahagun, p. 341; 1. vi, c. 7).
He, too, is born of a virgin mother (Brinton, p. 90).
