#### § 6. Symbols of Mithra.

To point to these Mithraic monuments, of which there are so many
examples, is to point out, further, that the old Persian aversion to
images of deity had disappeared with the extension of the Mithraic
cultus. <span id="fr_1495"></span>[2](#fn_1495.md) There is no doubt as to
the original forbiddal of images, despite the common delusion that the
Jews were the first to lay down such a veto. But it was inevitable that,
in the artistic countries, <span id="fr_1496"></span>[3](#fn_1496.md) the
adoption of Mithraism should involve the representing Mithra by images,
like other deities. Nor was this all. One reason for regarding the
Zend-Avesta as substantially ancient is the comparative simplicity of
the Mithra cultus it sets forth. Just as happened with Christianity
later, the spreading faith assimilated all manner of ancient symbolisms,
and new complications of ritual; and Mithra is associated with the
strange symbolic figures of the lion-headed serpentine God, bearing two
keys, but above all is presented in that of the slayer of the bull.
Whence came that conception? There are many explanations. It has been
variously decided that the bull slain by Mithra is the symbol of the
earth, the symbol of the moon, the symbol of the sun, the symbol of
lust, the symbol of evil, the symbol of the cloud, the bull of the
Zodiac, and the cosmogonic bull of the Magian system. <span
id="fr_1497"></span>[4](#fn_1497.md) All of these conceptions

<span id="page_299">p. 299</span>

may be held to connect with the symbolism of the Veda, where Agni is the
bull; and it is in a similarly early sense, as the Sun-God among the
cows, that Mithra is in the Avesta the bull and the cow-stealer <span
id="fr_1498"></span>[1](#fn_1498.md)—which last name he retains in the late
Roman period, <span id="fr_1499"></span>[2](#fn_1499.md) when he has the
epithet in common with Hermes. On the basis of the primitive nature-myth
arose a host of imageries, all interfluent and inseparable, because all
fanciful. Any one who has followed the maze of symbolism in Plutarch's
*Isis and Osiris* will be prepared to believe that for the later
ancients Mithra as the bull had half-a-dozen significations. <span
id="fr_1500"></span>[3](#fn_1500.md) In that famous treatise, Isis and
Osiris and Typhon successively represent a number of different
Nature-forces—sun, moon, moisture, the Nile, the Earth, generative
warmth, injurious heat, and so on—shifting and exchanging their places,
till it becomes plain that the old theosophy was but a ceaseless flux of
more or less congruous fancies. We may be sure that Mithraism was as
hospitable to mystic meanings as Osirianism. It is intelligible and
probable that Mithra slaying the bull should have meant for many the
rays of the sun penetrating the earth, and so creating life for mundane
creatures, <span id="fr_1501"></span>[4](#fn_1501.md) as the dog feeds on
the blood <span id="fr_1502"></span>[5](#fn_1502.md) of the slain bull. In
the Vendidâd, the older (Vedic) God Yima, whose "glory" was secured by
Mithra when Yima fell through disobedience, <span
id="fr_1503"></span>[6](#fn_1503.md) is represented as "sealing the earth
with his golden seal," and thrusting into it with his dagger, <span
id="fr_1504"></span>[7](#fn_1504.md) which is perhaps the earliest form of
the myth under notice.

But those who adopt this as the whole explanation <span
id="fr_1505"></span>[8](#fn_1505.md) overlook a principle perhaps bound up
with the origin of Mithraism proper—the significance of the bull as one
of those signs of the zodiac through which the sun passed in his annual
course. It is nearly certain that the zodiac was the source of very much
of the later symbolism and mysticism of those ancient cults which their
priesthoods associated

<span id="page_300">p. 300</span>

with the sun, not to speak of those whose priesthoods professedly
repudiated sun-worship. And one of the most important facts established
by the collection and comparison of ancient monuments <span
id="fr_1506"></span>[1](#fn_1506.md) is, that the Mithraic cultus connects
symbolically with an Assyrian or Akkadian cultus far older—the cult
which produced those common Assyrian monuments in which a divine or
kingly personage slays a lion or a bull, thrusting a sword through
him. <span id="fr_1507"></span>[2](#fn_1507.md) There can be little doubt
that these successive religious representations of the slaying of the
lion and the slaying of the bull rest partly on a zodiacal system of
sacred symbolism, in which the slaying of a given animal means either
the passing of the sun into or out of a particular sign of the zodiac at
a particular season of the year, or the slaying of the animal
represented as a special sacrifice, or both.

The zodiac, which is of immense antiquity, <span
id="fr_1508"></span>[3](#fn_1508.md) has come to be conventionalised—that
is to say, it is fixed, so that the signs have long ceased to coincide
with the actual constellations whose names they bear. But originally the
students of the stars must needs have had regard to the actual
constellations. And this carries us very far back indeed. The view that
the slaying of the bull originally pointed to the sun's entering the
sign of the Bull at either the vernal equinox or the winter
solstice <span id="fr_1509"></span>[4](#fn_1509.md) is supported by the
circumstance that the bull was at once a symbol of the Sun-God and a
symbol of agriculture, the early plough being drawn by bulls or oxen
(whence possibly the naming of the constellation); <span
id="fr_1510"></span>[5](#fn_1510.md) and is

<span id="page_301">p. 301</span>

strongly suggested further by the hostile function assigned in the
monuments to the Scorpion, which is the opposing sign, and would
represent the autumnal equinox. <span id="fr_1511"></span>[1](#fn_1511.md)
This symbol then dates back, probably, more than 3,000 years before the
Christian era—6,000 years if we assume the original zodiacal year to
have begun at the winter solstice; while the symbol of the slaying of
the lion would signify the sun's entrance into Leo at midsummer in the
same periods, and may connect with the worship of Tammuz, after whom the
midsummer month was named in Syria—unless the God took his name from the
month. In point of fact, astronomy tells us that, by the precession of
the equinoxes, the constellation of the Bull had ceased to be the sun's
place at the vernal equinox for about 2,100 years before the reign of
Augustus, the constellation of the Ram taking its place. Still, just as
the symbol of the slaying of the lion had, on this theory, held its
ground in religion after the bull played a similar part, so did the sign
of the Bull play its part in symbol and ceremony long after the sun had
begun to enter the constellation Aries at the sacred season.
Nevertheless—and this seems a crowning vindication of the zodiacal
theory—while the bull holds its place on the monuments of the Christian
era, we find at this very period, in connection with the worship of
Mithra as with those of Dionysos <span id="fr_1512"></span>[2](#fn_1512.md)
and (more anciently) of Amun, <span id="fr_1513"></span>[3](#fn_1513.md) an
actual ceremony of slaying a ram in honour of the Sun-God. In Persia,
the sign Aries, the Ram, was known as the Lamb; <span
id="fr_1514"></span>[4](#fn_1514.md) and in some of the Mithraic mysteries
at the Christian era, it was a lamb that was slain. <span
id="fr_1515"></span>[5](#fn_1515.md) That fact, as we shall see, has
further bearings; but thus far it surely counts for much as a proof of
the zodiacal element in the symbolism of the ancient sophisticated sun
worships. The notion of a Fish God is deeply rooted in several of the
older eastern religions, <span id="fr_1516"></span>[6](#fn_1516.md) and
though it may be explained as arising from the fancy that the sun was a
fish, who plunged into the sea in the evening and emerged in the
morning—a natural type of immortality for later mystics—it also strongly
suggests an ancient connection with zodiacal astrolatry.

<span id="page_302">p. 302</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> In any case, there
is no more plausible explanation than the zodiacal one of the early
Christian habit of calling Jesus Christ the Fish. The sign of the Fishes
comes next the Ram in the zodiac; and that constellation had actually
taken the place of the Ram, at the spring equinox, when this symbol came
into use. <span id="fr_1517"></span>[1](#fn_1517.md)

We may further infer, when we read of Phrixos, the son of Athamas, who
was carried to Colchis by a ram with a golden fleece, <span
id="fr_1518"></span>[2](#fn_1518.md) and who in his statue on the Acropolis
was represented as having "just sacrificed the ram to some God," <span
id="fr_1519"></span>[3](#fn_1519.md) that in some eastern cult <span
id="fr_1520"></span>[4](#fn_1520.md) which the Greeks misunderstood, a
deity was latterly figured as borne on the zodiacal Ram, in the manner
of Mithras "bull-borne," <span id="fr_1521"></span>[5](#fn_1521.md) and as
sacrificing the ram in its turn. And that there was a constant
astronomical significance in the Mithraic cult in particular, we know
from the testimony of Origen, to the effect that its mysteries included
an elaborate representation of the movements and relations of the stars
and the planets, and the movements of the disembodied human soul among
these. <span id="fr_1522"></span>[6](#fn_1522.md)

Every widespread religion, however, is necessarily a complex of many
ideas, and in the cult of Mithra this is abundantly seen. In the course
of its western evolution it became closely associated, like that of
Attis, with the popular worship of Cybelê, the Magna Mater, Mother of
the Gods; <span id="fr_1523"></span>[7](#fn_1523.md) and in virtue of Roman
military tradition it was bracketed with that of many specifically Roman
deities. In the Mithraic cave-temples have been found images and names
of Juno, Minerva, Apollo, Mars, Bacchus, Mercury, and Venus, "and
especially Silvanus, who had taken on the character of a pantheistic
God, doubtless because he was the Latin equivalent of the Greek Pan."'
This, by the way, is not the sole reason for approximating Mithra to
Pan." <span id="fr_1524"></span>[8](#fn_1524.md) A collocation of the
Sun-God with the Goat-God occurs constantly in Greek mythology, and can
be clearly traced back to the Babylonian system, on which Mithraism had
independently drawn. <span id="fr_1525"></span>[9](#fn_1525.md) The image
of the slaying of the bull, in particular, whatever its original
bearing, came to be associated

<span id="page_303">p. 303</span>

specially with the idea of sacrifice and purification; and the great
vogue of the Phrygian institutions of the Taurobolium and
Criobolium, <span id="fr_1526"></span>[1](#fn_1526.md) or purification by
the blood of bulls and rams, must have reacted on Mithraism, even if it
were not of strictly Mithraic origin. Mithra, like Osiris <span
id="fr_1527"></span>[2](#fn_1527.md) and Dionysos, <span
id="fr_1528"></span>[3](#fn_1528.md) we saw, <span
id="fr_1529"></span>[4](#fn_1529.md) was the bull as well as the God to
whom the bull was sacrificed, even as Amun, to whom rams were
sacrificed, was "the great ram"; <span id="fr_1530"></span>[5](#fn_1530.md)
and herein lies one of the germs of the dogma of the death and
resurrection of the God; another being the ancient astronomic myth, to
which we shall come later, of the Descent of the God to Hades. In the
procedure of the Taurobolia and Criobolia, which grew very popular in
the Roman world, <span id="fr_1531"></span>[6](#fn_1531.md) we have the
literal and original meaning of the phrase "washed in the blood of the
lamb"; the doctrine being that resurrection and eternal life were
secured by drenching or sprinkling with the actual blood of a
sacrificial bull or ram, often doubtless a lamb, that being a common
sacrifice from time immemorial, on the ground that for certain purposes
the victim must be sexually pure. Thus we have such mortuary
inscriptions as *Taurobolio criobolioque in aeternum renatus*, "By the
bull-sacrifice and the ram-sacrifice born again for eternity." <span
id="fr_1532"></span>[7](#fn_1532.md) But inasmuch as there was a constant
tendency in the mystical systems to substitute symbolism for concrete
usages, the Mithraists may be surmised to have ultimately performed
their sacrificial rites in a less crude form than that described by
Prudentius. <span id="fr_1533"></span>[8](#fn_1533.md)

follow Canon Rawlinson's meaning in the statement (*Seventh Oriental

idolatry in respect of the worship of Mithra." For that matter, however,
the "idolatry" of antiquity in general is on all fours with the
reverence of images under Christianity.

the <span id="page_299">p. 299</span> bull, like the Vedic cow, = the
cloud; that its seed is the rain (p. 149); and that its true slayer is
the serpent (p. 153). In the zodiac, the bull was *domus Veneris*. But
the idea that the bull or ram symbolised lust could well be primary; and
in the Persian myth the ram helps to lead the first man and woman into
sin (Spiegel, *Erân. Alterthumsk.*, i, 511-512; *Bundahish*., xv, 13).
For Porphyry, the God (Mithra) who was a stealer of oxen was secretly
concerned with generation (*De antro*, xviii). As to the primeval ox,
source of all animals, see the Bundahish, iii, 4-18; iv, 1, etc. (West's
*Pahlavi Texts*, i, 17-20. S.B.E. vol. v).

the cows as hidden in a cave; and Porphyry, as last cited.

<span id="fn_1500"></span>[299:3](pch67.htm#fr_1500.md) For Porphyry,
Mithra is "the Bull Demiourgos" and "lord of genesis" (*De antro*,
xxiv).

<span id="fn_1501"></span>[299:4](pch67.htm#fr_1501.md) This interpretation
is clearly adopted in one monument which makes ears of corn instead of
blood come from the bull's wound. Cumont, ii, 228.

<span id="fn_1506"></span>[300:1](pch67.htm#fr_1506.md) See the series in
Lajard's *Atlas*. Professor Cumont, while of course rejecting Lajard's
theory that Mithraism originated in the Assyrian system, recognises that
the planetary and zodiacal elements in Mithraism were certainly borrowed
by it from the ancient Chaldean system; and that in general Chaldean
elements were early superimposed upon the Iranian when the cults met at
Babylon (*Textes et Monuments*, i, 73, 109).

<span id="fn_1507"></span>[300:2](pch67.htm#fr_1507.md) Sometimes in the
Persian period a griffin or dragon (pronounced by Justi, *Gesch. des
alten Persiens*, p. 109, to be the Arimanian beast) takes the place of
the lion or bull. See the figure from Persepolis in *Ancient Calendars
and Constellations*, by the Hon. Emmeline E. Plunkett, 1903, p. 64. Miss
Plunkett points out that this figure is a compound of the *four*
zodiacal figures, the Bull, the Lion, the Scorpion, and the Eagle. The
bull and the lion, as well as this composite, appear in Persian
sculpture of the age of Xerxes, evidently following the Assyrian models.
Reber, *History of Ancient Art*, Eng. tr. 1883, pp. 123-5. Again, there
is a presumption that the design of a lion attacking a bull or an
ilcorn, seen on a number of ancient coins in Asia Minor, and even in
Macedonia, is a symbol analogous to that of Mithra slaying the bull (see
Parker and Ainsworth's *Lares and Penates*, 1853, p. 187, where the
explanation given will not stand). Persia is still the "Land of the Lion
and the Sun." Cp. the figures on the palace of Xerxes, reproduced by
Justi, p. 106.

Jensen, *Kosmologie der Babylonier*, 1890, pp. 57-95; Jastrow, *The
Religion of Babylonia, and Assyria*, 1898, pp. 434, 456. The careful
argument of Letronne (*Mélanges d’érudition et de critique historique;
Origin des Zodiaques*) to show that the zodiac originated with the
Greeks is exploded by the discoveries of Assyriology. The ideas of
Macrobius and of Dupuis and Volney, which Letronne undertook to
overthrow, are thus in large measure rehabilitated. See R. Brown. jun.,
*Eridanus: River and Constellation*, 1883; *The Phainomena of Aratos*,
1885; and *Primitive Constellations of the Greeks, Phœnicians, and
Babylonians*, 1899. The point is newly established in Miss Plunkett's
work, above cited, which is an important contribution to astronomical
mythology, though not very advanced in Biblical matters.

<span id="fn_1509"></span>[300:4](pch67.htm#fr_1509.md) The latter is the
hypothesis argued for by Miss Plunkett, work cited, p. 18 *sq*.

title given to Merodach, the Sun-God, when he passed through the twelve
zodiacal signs, was Gudi-bir, 'the bull of light.'"—Cp. pp. 290, 292.

<span id="fn_1511"></span>[301:1](pch67.htm#fr_1511.md) Lenormant
(*Chaldean Magic*, p. 56) rejects the idea that there was an
astronomical significance in the Assyrian bull-slaying; but his
arguments do not amount to a refutation. He rests his denial on one
fragment of a conjuration, which makes demons bulls.
