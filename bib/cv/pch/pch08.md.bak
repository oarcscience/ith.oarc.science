#### § 4.

Putting aside as unscientific all such prejudgments, and leaving the
professed religionist his personal remedy of discriminating finally
between "true" and "false" religion, let us begin at the beginning by
noting that "religious consciousness" can intelligibly mean only a given
*direction* of consciousness. And if we are to make any consistent
specification of the point at which consciousness *begins* to be
religious, we shall put it impartially in simple animism—the spontaneous
surmise, seen to be dimly made or makable even by animals, "that not
only animals and plants, but inanimate things, may possess life." Dr.
Jevons rightly points out <span id="fr_30"></span>[1](#fn_30.md) that this
primary notion "neither proceeds from nor implies nor accounts for
belief in the *super*natural"; and he goes on to show (developing here
the doctrine which he ultimately repudiates) how the latter notion would
arise through man's connecting with certain agencies or "spirits" the
frustrative or molestive power "which he had already found to exercise
an unexpected and irresistible control over his destiny." "In this way,"
continues Dr. Jevons, suddenly granting much more than he need or ought,
"the notion of supernatural power, which originally was purely negative
and manifested itself merely in suspending or counteracting the
uniformity of nature, came to have a positive content." From this point,
as might have been divined, the argument becomes confused to the last
degree. We have been brought to the supernatural as a primitive product
of (*a*) the recognition of irregular and frustrative forces *in*
nature, and (*b*) the identification of them as personalities or spirits
like man. But immediately, in the interests of another preconception,
the theorist proceeds in effect to cancel this by arguing that, when men
resort to magic, the idea of the supernatural has disappeared. His
proposition is that "the belief in the supernatural was prior to the
belief in magic, and that the latter, whenever it sprang up, was a
degradation or relapse in the evolution of religion," <span
id="fr_31"></span>[2](#fn_31.md) inasmuch as it assumed man's power to
control the forces of Nature by certain stratagems. And as he argues at
the

<span id="page_10">p. 10</span>

same time that "religion and magic had different origins, and were
always essentially distinct from one another," it is implied that
religion began in that belief in a (frustrative) supernatural which is
asserted to have preceded magic. That is to say, religion began in the
recognition of hostile or dangerous powers.

Now, a logically vigilant investigator would either not have said that
belief in a supernatural was constituted by the recognition of hostile
personal forces in Nature, or, having said it, would have granted that
magic was an effort to circumvent supernatural as well as other forces.
Dr. Jevons first credits the early savage with, among other things, a
conception of supernatural power which excluded the idea of man's
opposition, and then with the power so to transform his first notion as
to see in the so-called supernatural merely forms of Nature. An
intellectual process achieved in the civilised world only as a long and
arduous upward evolution on scientific lines is thus supposed to have
been more or less sudden'': effected as a mere matter either of ignorant
downward drift or of perverse experiment by primeval man, or at least by
savage man. It is not easy to be more arbitrary in the way of
hypothesis.

Combating the contrary view, which makes magic prior to religion, Dr.
Jevons writes:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">To read some writers, who derive the powers of
priests (and even of the gods) from those of the magician, and who
consider apparently that magic requires no explanation, one would
imagine that the savage, surrounded by supernatural powers and a prey to
supernatural terrors, one day conceived the happy idea that he too would
himself exercise supernatural power—and the thing was done: sorcery was
invented, and the rest of the evolution of religion follows without
difficulty. <span id="fr_32"></span>[1](#fn_32.md)</span>

</div>

It is difficult to estimate the relevance of this criticism without
knowing the precise expressions which provoked it; but as regards any
prevailing view of evolution it is somewhat pointless. "One day" is not
the formula of evolutionary conceptions. But Dr. Jevons’s own doctrine,
which is to the effect that magical rites arose by way of parody of
worship-rites after the latter had for ages been in undisputed
possession, suggests just such a catastrophic conception as he imputes.
Rejecting the obvious evolutionary hypothesis that explicit magic and
explicit religion so-called arose confusedly together—that magic employs
early religious machinery because it is but a contemporary expression of
the state of mind in which religion rises and roots—he insists that
magic cannot have been tried save by way of late "parody," in an
intellectual atmosphere

<span id="page_11">p. 11</span>

which, nevertheless, he declares to be extremely conservative, <span
id="fr_33"></span>[1](#fn_33.md) and which is therefore extremely unlikely
to develop such parodies. <span id="fr_34"></span>[2](#fn_34.md)

Dr. Jevons’s doctrinal motive, it is pretty clear, is his wish to
relieve "religion" of the discredit of "magic," even as he finally and
remorsefully seeks to relieve it of the discredit of originating in
"fear." Having no such axe to grind, the scientific inquirer might here
offer to let "religion" mean anything Dr. Jevons likes, if he will only
stick to one definition. But science must stipulate for *some* term to
designate a series of psychological processes which originate in the
same order of cognitions and conceptions, on the same plane of
knowledge, and have strictly correlative results in action. And as such
a term would certainly have to be applied sooner or later to much of
what Dr. Jevons wants to call "religion," we may just as well thrash out
the issue over that long-established name.

<span id="fn_34"></span>[11:2](pch08.htm#fr_34.md) Dr. Jevons has latterly
(*Sociological Review*, April, 1908) treated the problem in a very lucid
essay on "The Definition of Magic," in which he discusses the positions
of Dr. Frazer, MM. Hubert and Mauss, and Professor Wundt. He sums up,
without dogmatism, on the side of the view of Wundt, which, as I
understand it, is in harmony with that set forth in these pages, and is
certainly in apparent opposition to that of Dr. Jevons as here
criticised. I infer that Dr. Jevons has now modified his theory, but
leave my discussion standing, for what it is worth. \[*Note to 2nd
ed*.\]
