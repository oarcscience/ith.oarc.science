#### § 15. The Gospel Mystery-Play.

It is not disputed that one of the most marked features of the popular
religions of antiquity, in Greece, Egypt, and Greek-speaking Asia, was
the dramatic representation of the central episodes in the stories of
the suffering and dying Gods and Goddesses. Herodotus has been charged
with pretending to knowledge that he did not possess; but there is no
reason to doubt his assertion <span id="fr_998"></span>[3](#fn_998.md) that
on the artificial circular lake at Sais the Egyptians were wont to give
by night—presumably once a year—representations of the sufferings of a
certain one whom he will not name, which representations they called
mysteries. The certain one in question we know must have been the God
Osiris; <span id="fr_999"></span>[4](#fn_999.md) and that the sufferings
and death of Osiris

<span id="page_195">p. 195</span>

were dramatically represented, modern Egyptology has freshly established
from hieroglyphic documents. <span id="fr_1000"></span>[1](#fn_1000.md) We,
know, too, from the concluding rubric of the "Lamentations of Isis and
Nephthys for Osiris that those Goddesses were personated in the ritual
by two beautiful women. <span id="fr_1001"></span>[2](#fn_1001.md)

In the worships of Adonis and of Attis there was certainly a dramatic
representation of the dead God by effigy, and of his resurrection; <span
id="fr_1002"></span>[3](#fn_1002.md) and in the mysteries of Mithra, as
given among the Greeks, there appears to have been included a
representation of the burial of a stone effigy of the God, in a rock
tomb, and of his resurrection. <span id="fr_1003"></span>[4](#fn_1003.md)
So, in the great cult of Dionysos, with whose worship were connected the
beginnings of tragedy among the Greeks, there was a symbolic
representation of the dismemberment of the young God by the Titans, this
being part of the sacrament of his body and blood; <span
id="fr_1004"></span>[5](#fn_1004.md) and in the special centres of the
worship of Herakles, or at least at one of them, Tarsus, there was
annually erected in his worship a funeral pyre, on which his effigy—but
sometimes a man—was burned. <span id="fr_1005"></span>[6](#fn_1005.md) The
same motive is worked out in the *Trachiniæ* of Sophocles. Among the
Greeks, again, a dramatic representation of the myth of the loss of
Persephonê, the mourning of her mother Dêmêtêr, and her restoration, was
the central attraction in the Eleusinian mysteries; and the return of
Persephonê was separately dramatised. <span
id="fr_1006"></span>[7](#fn_1006.md)

Of all those mysteries the mythological explanation is doubtless the
same: they mostly originated in primitive sacrificial rituals to
represent the annual death of vegetation, and to charm it into
returning; and in the cult of Mithra, who, like Herakles, is
specifically a Sun-God, there may have been an adaptation from the rites
of the Vegetation-Gods. In the later stages the magic which had been
supposed to revive vegetation is applied to securing the life of the
initiate in the next world. We are not here concerned, however, with the
origin of the usage. For our purpose it suffices

<span id="page_196">p. 196</span>

us to know that such rites were rites of "salvation," and that they were
the most popular in ancient religion. <span
id="fr_1007"></span>[1](#fn_1007.md)

As Christism first became popular by the development or adaptation of
myths and ritual usages like those of the popular pagan systems, notably
the Birth-myth, the Holy Supper, and the Resurrection, it might be
expected that it should imitate paganism in the matter of dramatic
mysteries. The mere Supper ritual, indeed, is itself dramatic, the
celebrant personating the God as Attis was personated by his
priest; <span id="fr_1008"></span>[2](#fn_1008.md) and in the remarkable
expression in the Pauline epistle to the Galatians (iii, 1)—"before
whose eyes Jesus Christ was openly set forth crucified"—we have probably
a record of an early fashion of imaging the crucifixion. <span
id="fr_1009"></span>[3](#fn_1009) In the same document (vi, 17.md) is the
phrase, "I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus"; and various
other expressions in the epistles, describing the devotee as mystically
crucified and as having become one with the crucified Lord, suggest that
in the early stages of the cult it dramatically adopted the apparently
dramatic teaching of the Egyptian Book of the Dead, wherein the saved
and Osirified soul declares: "I clasp the sycamore tree; I myself am
joined unto the sycamore tree, and its arms are opened unto me
graciously"; <span id="fr_1010"></span>[4](#fn_1010.md) and again: "I have
become a divine being by the side of the *birth-chamber* of Osiris; I am
brought forth with him, I renew my youth." <span
id="fr_1011"></span>[5](#fn_1011.md) In the fifth century, we know,
mystery-plays were performed either in or in connection with the
churches; <span id="fr_1012"></span>[6](#fn_1012.md) and the identity
between the birth-story and several pagan dramatic rituals is too close
to be missed. <span id="fr_1013"></span>[7](#fn_1013.md) But apart from the
parallels above indicated the dramatic *origination* of the story of the
Christ's Supper, Passion, Betrayal, Trial, and Crucifixion, as it now
stands, has yet to be established. The proof, however, I submit, lies,
and has always lain, before men's eyes in the actual gospel narrative.

<span id="page_197">p. 197</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> It is the
prepossessions set up by age-long belief that have prevented alike
believers and unbelievers from seeing as much.

Let the reader carefully peruse the story of the series of episodes as
they are given in their least sophisticated form, in the gospels of
Matthew and Mark. From Matthew xxvi, 17, or 20, it will be noted, the
narrative is simply a presentment of *a dramatic action and dialogue;*
and the events are huddled one upon another exactly as happens in all
drama that is not framed with a special concern for plausibility. In
many plays of Shakespeare, notably in *Measure for Measure*, <span
id="fr_1014"></span>[1](#fn_1014.md) there occurs such a compression of
incidents in time, the reason being precisely the nature of drama,
which, whether or not it holds theoretically by the unities, must for
practical reasons minimise change of scene and develop action rapidly.
Even in the *Hedda Gabler* of Ibsen, the chief master of modern drama,
this exigency of the conditions leads the dramatist in the last act to
the startling step of making the friends of the suicide sit down to
prepare his manuscripts for the press within a few minutes of his death.
To realise fully the theatrical character of the gospel story, it is
necessary to keep in view this characteristic compression of the action
in time, as well as the purely dramatic content. The point is not merely
that the compression of events proves the narrative to be pure fiction,
but that they are compressed for a reason—the reason being that they are
presented in a drama.

As the story stands, Jesus partakes with his disciples of the Passover,
an evening meal; and after a very brief dialogue they sing a hymn, and
proceed in the darkness to the mount of Olives. Not a word is said of
what happened or was said on the way: the scene is simply changed to the
mount; and there begin a new dialogue and action. A slight change of
scene—again effected with no hint of any talk on the way—is made to
Gethsemane; and here the scanty details as to the separation from "his
disciples," and the going apart with the three, indicate with a brevity
obviously dramatic the arrangement by which Judas—who was thus far with
the party—would on the stage be enabled to withdraw. Had the story been
first composed for writing, such an episode would necessarily have been
described; and something would naturally have been said of the talk on
the way from the supper-chamber to the mount. What we are reading is the
bare transcript of a primitive play, in which the writer has not here
attempted to insert more than has been shown on the scene.

<span id="page_198">p. 198</span>

In the Passion scene, this dramatic origination of the action is again
twice emphasised. Thrice over Jesus prays while his disciples sleep.
There is thus no one present or awake to record his words—an incongruity
which could not well have entered into a narrative originally composed
for reading, where it would have been a gratuitous invention, but which
*on the stage* would not be a difficulty at all, since there the prayer
would be heard and accepted by the audience, like a soliloquy in an
inartistic modern play. No less striking is the revelation made in
verses 45 and 46, where in two successive sentences, with no pause
between, Jesus tells the sleeping three to sleep on and to arise. What
has happened is either a slight disarrangement of the dialogue or the
omission of an exit and an entrance. Verse 44 runs: "And he left them
*again*, and went away, and prayed a third time, saying again the same
words." If verse 45, from the second clause onwards, were inserted
before verse 44—where, as the text stands, Jesus says nothing—and verse
46 introduced with "and saith unto them" immediately after the first
clause of verse 45, the incongruity would be removed. Only in
transcription from a dramatic text could it have arisen.

Then, without the slightest account of what he had been doing in the
interim, Judas enters the scene exactly as he would on the stage, with
his multitude, "while he \[Jesus\] yet spake." With an impossible
continuity, the action goes on through the night, a thing quite
unnecessary in any save a dramatic fiction, where unity of time—that is,
the limitation of the action within twenty-four hours, or little more,
as prescribed by Aristotle <span id="fr_1015"></span>[1](#fn_1015.md)—was
for the ancients a ruling principle. Jesus is taken in the darkness to
the house of the high-priest, "where the scribes and the elders were
gathered together." The disciples meanwhile had "left him and fled," and
not a word is said as to what they did in the interim; though any
account of the episode, in the terms of the tradition concerning them,
must have come through them.

But it is needless to insist on the absolutely unhistorical character of
a narrative which makes the whole judicial process take place in the
middle of the night, a time when, as Renan notes, an Eastern city is as
if dead. The point is that the invention is of a kind obviously
conditioned by a dramatic purpose. In the dead of night the authorities
proceed to hunt up "false witnesses" throughout

<span id="page_199">p. 199</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Jerusalem, because
the witnesses must be produced in the trial scene as closely as possible
on that of the capture; and the process goes on till two give the
requisite testimony. Then Jesus is questioned, condemned, buffeted, and
(presumably) led away; and Peter, remaining on the scene, denies his
lord and is convicted of treason by the crowing of the cock. Of what
happens to the doomed God-Man in this interval there is not a hint;
though it is just here that a non-dramatic narrative would naturally
follow him most closely.

Morning has thus come, and "*when* morning was come" the priests and
elders, who thus have had no rest, "take counsel" afresh to put Jesus to
death, and lead him away, bound, to Pilate. But this evidently happens
off the scene, since we have the interlude in which Judas brings back
his thirty pieces of silver, is repudiated by the priests, and goes away
to hang himself. The story of the potter's field is obviously a later
writer's interpolation in the narrative. An original narrator, telling a
story in a natural way, would have given details about Judas: the
interpolator characteristically wants to explain that "Then was
fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet."

As usual, not a word is said of the details of the transit from place to
place: the scene simply changes all at once to the presence of the
Governor; and here, with not a single touch of description such as an
original narrator might naturally give, we plunge straight into
dialogue. Always we are witnessing drama, of which the spectators needed
no description, and of which the subsequent transcriber reproduces
simply the action and the words, save in so far as he is absolutely
forced to insert a brief explanation of the Barabbas episode. The rest
of the trial scene, and the scene of the mock crowning and robing, are
strictly dramatic, giving nothing but words and action. In the account
of the trial before Herod, which is found only in Luke, the method of
narration is significantly different, being descriptive and
non-dramatic, as the work of an amplifying later narrator would
naturally be. The words of Herod are not given; and the interpolation
was doubtless the work of a late Gentile, bent on making Jewish and not
Roman soldiers guilty of mocking the Lord. <span
id="fr_1016"></span>[1](#fn_1016.md) In the first two gospels, even the
episode of the laying hold of Simon of Cyrene, to make him bear the
cross, might have been introduced at this point on the stage, without
involving the attempt—impossible in drama—to present the

<span id="page_200">p. 200</span>

procession to the place of crucifixion. Of that procession Matthew and
Mark offer no description: they simply adhere to the drama, leaving to
the later narrative of Luke the embellishment of the mourning crowd of
daughters of Jerusalem, and the speech of Jesus to them on the way. Even
Luke, however, offers no description of the march; and even his added
episode might have been brought into a dramatic action, either at the
close of the crowning-scene or at the beginning of that of the
crucifixion.

Here, as before, the action is strictly dramatic, save for the episode
of the Scriptural explanation of the casting of lots, which may or may
not have been a late addition to the action. No word is said of the
*aspect* of Jesus, a point on which an original narrator, if writing to
be read, or telling of what he had seen, would almost certainly have
said something. In a drama, of course, no such details were needed: the
suffering God-Man was there on the stage, seen by all the spectators.
The same account holds good of all the remaining scenes in the gospel
story, with a few exceptions. The three hours of darkness and silence
could not be enacted, though there might be a shorter interval; and the
rending of the temple veil, which could not take place on the scene, is
to be presumed a late addition to the transcribed narrative; but a
machinery of commotion may very well have been employed, and the wild
story of the opening of the graves of the saints may actually derive
from such a performance, though the absurdity of the 53rd verse is
wholly documentary. Such a story would naturally be dropped from later
gospels because of its sheer extravagance; but such a scruple would not
affect the early dramatists. Even the episode of the appeal of the
priests and Pharisees to Pilate to keep a guard on the tomb, though it
might be a later interpolation, could quite well have been a dramatic
scene, as it presents the Jews "gathered together unto Pilate,
saying....."

The resurrection scene, like that of the crucifixion, is wholly
"staged." The two Maries, who sat before the sepulchre when Joseph
closed it, appear again late on the Sabbath day, having presumably been
driven away by the guard before. Nothing is said of what has gone on
among the disciples; nothing of the communion of the mourning women: the
whole narrative is rigidly limited to the strictly consecutive dramatic
action, as it would be represented on the stage. Even the final
appearance in Galilee is set forth in the same fashion, and the gospel
even as it stands ends abruptly with the words of the risen Lord. When
the mystery-play was first transcribed, it may have ended at Matt.
xxviii, 10, verses 11-15

<span id="page_201">p. 201</span>

having strong marks of late addition. But it may quite well have
included verses 16-20, with the obvious exception of the clause about
the Trinity, which is certainly late. In any case, it ended on a speech.

Why should such a document so end, if it were the work of a narrator
setting down what he knew or had heard? Why should he not round off his
narrative in the normal manner? The "higher criticism" has recognised
that the story of the betrayal and the rest do not belong to the earlier
matter of the gospels. The analysis of the school of Bernhard Weiss, as
presented by Mr. A. J. Jolley, <span id="fr_1017"></span>[1](#fn_1017.md)
makes the "Primitive Gospel" end with the scene of the anointing. I hold
that scene to have been also dramatic, and to have been first framed as
a prologue to the Mystery-Play; <span id="fr_1018"></span>[2](#fn_1018.md)
but the essential point is that all that portion which I have above
treated as the Mystery-Play is an addition to a previously existing
document. Not that the play (in some form) was not older than the
document, but that its transcription is later. And this theory gives the
explanation as to the abruptness of the conclusion. Where the play ended
the narrative ends. Only in the later third gospel do we find the close,
and some other episodes, such as the Herod trial and the account of
Joseph of Arimathea, treated in the narrative spirit—in the manner, that
is, of a narrative framed for reading. In Luke's conclusion there is
still a certain scenic suggestion; but it is a distant imitation of the
concrete theatricality of the earlier version; description is freely
interspersed; speeches are freely lengthened; and the story is rounded
off as an adaptive writer would naturally treat it.

In the earlier gospels such a treatment has not been ventured on. There
are but a few doctrinary and explanatory interpolations; the descriptive
element is kept nearly at the possible minimum; the scenic action is
adhered to even where interpolated description would clearly be
appropriate for narrative purposes; the transcriber even stumbles over
his text to the extent of joining two speeches which should have an
entrance and an exit between them; and when the last scene ends the
gospel ends. The transcriber has been able to add to the previous gospel
the matter of the mystery-play; and there he loyally stops. His work has
been done in good faith, up to his lights; and he does not presume to
speak of matters of which he knows nothing. Later doctrinaires, with a
dogma to support, might tamper with the document: he sticks to his copy.
Doubtless the addition was made by Gentile hands. In the play the
apostles

<span id="page_202">p. 202</span>

are unfavourably presented, and the episode of the treason of Peter is
probably a Gentile invention made to discredit the Judaising party, who
held by a Petrine tradition, though on the other hand the gospel text
about the rock is presumably a late invention in the interest of the
Roman See.

In this connection there arises the question whether the specifically
dramatic "Acts of Pilate," as contained in the non-canonical "Gospel of
Nicodemus," may not likewise represent an original drama. Broadly
speaking, it seems to do so, and it may conceivably proceed upon a
dramatic text independently of the synoptics. On the ground, not of its
dramatic form but of the occasional relative brevity and the general
consistency of its narrative, it has even been argued <span
id="fr_1019"></span>[1](#fn_1019.md) that its matter is earlier than the
version of the story in any of the gospels. With that problem we are not
here concerned; but it is relevant to note that the dramatic action of
the non-canonical gospel is not earlier but later than that preserved in
the canonical. In the "Acts of Pilate" the trial scene is composed by
reducing to drama a whole series of episodes from the previous gospel
history, the various persons miraculously cured by Jesus coming forward
to give evidence on his behalf. Even the story of the water-wine miracle
is embodied from the fourth gospel. This expansion is manifestly a late
device, and has the effect of making the already impossible trial scene
newly extravagant. And while the trial in the "Acts" is in passages more
strictly dramatic than in the gospel, those very passages tell of
redaction, not of priority. Thus Pilate is made to utter in his address
the explanation concerning the usage of releasing a prisoner, and
volunteers allusion to Barabbas, where the gospel gives those details by
way of narrative. It is clear that in the natural and original form of
such a drama Pilate would not so speak: the speech is a sophistication.

Whether or not, then, the "Acts" proceeded on a separate dramatic text,
it does not preserve an earlier version. That it does not give the
absurd detail about the risen saints visiting the holy city after the
resurrection is merely a fresh proof that the first gospel is at that
point interpolated. The mere fact that the "Acts" gives names to
personages who are without names in the canonical gospels—as, the two
thieves and the soldier who pierced the Lord's side—tells of lateness.
What the document does signify is the apparent extension of the
mystery-play beyond the limits of that embodied in the first gospel, and
under the same pressure of

<span id="page_203">p. 203</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Gentile motive,
the whole effect of the extension being to throw a greater guilt of
perversity on the Jews and to put Pilate in a favourable light. That the
play in the "Acts" came from a source to which the Syrian sacrificial
tradition was alien is further suggested by the fact that it places the
act of mock-crowning at Golgotha, not in the Praetorium, and that for
the scarlet robe it substitutes a linen cloth; while a formal sentence
of scourging is passed by Pilate. Finally, the resurrection does not
happen upon the scene, but is related by the mouths of the Roman
soldiers, as if the dramatist or compiler were bent on producing new and
stronger evidence in proof of the event.

On any view, however, the dramatic form of the "Acts" serves to
strengthen the presumption that dramatic representations of the death of
Jesus were early current, and thus to support the foregoing
interpretation of the gospel story. That interpretation, it is
submitted, fits the whole case, and at once explains what otherwise is
inexplicable, the peculiar character of what is clearly an unhistorical
narrative. Assume the story to be either a tradition reduced to writing
long after the event, or the work of a deliberate inventor desirous of
giving some detail to a story of which he had received the barest
mention. Either way, why should that impossible huddling of the action,
that crowding of the betrayal and the trial into one night, have been
resorted to? It does not help the story as a narrative for reading: it
makes it, on the contrary, so improbable that only the hebetude of
reverence can prevent anyone from seeing its untruth. The solution is
instant and decisive when we realise that what we are reading is the
bare transcription of a mystery-play, framed on the principle of "unity
of time."

As has been remarked, it is not to be supposed that the play as it
stands in the gospel is primordial; rather it is a piece of technical
though unliterary elaboration, albeit older than the play in the "Acts
of Pilate," for if we divide it by its scenes or places we have the
classic five acts:—first, the Supper; second, the Agony and Betrayal,
both occurring on the mount; third, the trial at the high-priest's
house; fourth, the trial before Pilate; fifth, the Crucifixion. If we
suppose this to have been one continuous play, the resurrection may have
been a separate action, with five scenes—the removal of the body by
Joseph; the burial; the placing of the guard of soldiers; the coming of
the women and the address of the angel; and the appearance of the risen
Lord. But similarly the early action may have been divided: the
anointing scene, the visit of Judas to the priests, the visit of the
disciples to the "certain man" in whose

<span id="page_204">p. 204</span>

house the Supper was to be eaten—all these may have been dramatically
presented in the first instance. The scene of the Transfiguration, too,
has every appearance of having been a dramatic representation in the
manner of the pagan mysteries. But the theory of the dramatic origin of
the coherent yet impossible story of the Supper, Agony, Betrayal, the
two Trials, and the Crucifixion, does not depend on any decisive
apportionment of the scenes. It is borne out at every point by every
detail of the structure of the story as we have it in transcription; and
when this is once recognised, our conception of the manner of the origin
of the gospels is at this point at least placed on a new, we might say a
scientific, basis.

Chambers (*The Medieval Stage*, 1903, ii, 3 note), citing the essay in
which the above argument was first formulated, takes it as suggesting a
dramatic representation in the case of the epistolary references. That
was not the intention. His citation of Lightfoot's denial that the word

wilder Jansenists, "une des dévotions les plus appréciées consistait à
se faire crucifier comme le Christ" (A. Réville, *Prolégomènes de
l’histoire de religion*, 3e édit. p. 173).

<span id="fn_1015"></span>[198:1](pch42.htm#fr_1015.md) *Poetics*, v. Mr.
Chambers (*Med. Stage*, as cited), understanding that I suppose the
mystery-play to have been "on classical lines," remarks that the
narrative before us "cannot on the face of it be derived from a
classical drama." I entirely agree. It is a *non-literary* drama,
"classical" only in regard to the unities. Mr. Chambers suggests as a
type the Græco-Jewish Ἐξαγωγή of Ezechiel, 1st c. B.C.

<span id="fn_1016"></span>[199:1](pch42.htm#fr_1016.md) Such a scene *may*
have been enacted in one version of the mystery-play; but it is not
*transcribed* in Luke as the earlier play is in Matthew.
