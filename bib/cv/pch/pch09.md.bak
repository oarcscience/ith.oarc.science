#### § 5.

The need for an understanding becomes pressing when we compare with the
conceptions of Dr. Jevons those of Dr. J. G. Frazer, as set forth in the
revised edition of his great work, *The Golden Bough*. Having before the
issue of his first edition "failed, perhaps inexcusably," he modestly
avows, "to define even to myself my notion of religion," he was then
"disposed to class magic loosely under it as one of its lower forms."
Now he has "come to agree with Sir A. C. Lyall and Mr. F. B. Jevons in
recognising a fundamental distinction and even opposition of principle
between magic and religion." <span id="fr_35"></span>[3](#fn_35.md) On this
view he defines religion as "a propitiation or conciliation of powers
superior to man which are believed to direct and control the course of
nature and of human life. In this sense," he adds, "it will readily be
perceived that religion is opposed in principle both to magic and to
science." <span id="fr_36"></span>[4](#fn_36.md)

The first comment on such a proposition is that it all depends on what
you mean by "principle." If religion means only the act of propitiation
and conciliation of certain alleged powers, its principle "may be placed
either in the hope that such propitiation will succeed or in the feeling
that it ought to be tried. In either case, the accuracy of the
proposition is far from clear. But we

<span id="page_12">p. 12</span>

must widen the issue. It will be seen that Dr. Frazer's formal
definition of religion is as inadequate as that implied in the argument
of Dr. Jevons, though his practical handling of the case is finally the
more scientific. On the above definition, *belief* is no part of
religion; <span id="fr_37"></span>[1](#fn_37.md) and neither is gratitude;
though fear may be held to be implied in propitiation. Further, religion
has by this definition nothing to do with ethics; and even conduct
shaped by way of simple obedience to a God's alleged commands is barely
recognised under the head of "propitiation." Finally, a theist who has
ever so reverently arrived at the idea of an All-wise Omnipotence which
*needs not* to be propitiated or conciliated, has on Dr. Frazer's
definition ceased to be religious. It will really not do.

I am not here pressing for a wider definition, as do some professed
rationalists, by way of securing for my own philosophy or ethic the
prestige of a highly respectable name; nor do I even endorse their claim
as for themselves. I simply urge that as a matter of scientific
convenience and consistency the word must be allowed to cover at least
the bulk of the phenomena to which it has immemorially been applied.
Where Dr. Frazer by his definition makes religion "nearly unknown" to
the Australian, because the Australian (mainly for lack of the
wherewithal) does not sacrifice, <span id="fr_38"></span>[2](#fn_38.md) Mr.
Lang ascribes to them a higher or deeper religious feeling on that very
account. <span id="fr_39"></span>[3](#fn_39.md) Such chaos of definition
must be averted by a more comprehensive theory. Whether or not we oppose
magic to religion, we cannot exclude from the latter term the whole
process of non-propitiatory religious ethic, of thanksgiving ritual, and
of cosmological doctrine. Later we shall have to deal with Dr. Jevons’s
attempt to withdraw the term from theistic philosophy and from
mythology; but we may provisionally insist that emotional resignation to
"the divine will" is in terms of all usage whatsoever a religious
phenomenon.

It remains to consider the alleged severance between religion and magic.
It is interesting to find Dr. Jevons and Dr. Frazer here partially at
one, as against the general opinion of anthropologists. That may be
cited from a theologian, Professor T. W. Davies, in whose doctoral
thesis on *Magic, Divination, and Demonology*—a performance both learned
and judicious—it is argued that "all

<span id="page_13">p. 13</span>

magic is a sort of religion." <span id="fr_40"></span>[1](#fn_40.md) Dr.
Frazer, while agreeing with Dr. Jevons that they are "opposed," differs
from him in holding that magic preceded religion; and by an odd fatality
Dr. Frazer contradicts himself as explicitly as does Dr. Jevons. After
avowing the belief that in the evolution of thought, magic, as
representing a lower intellectual stratum, has probably everywhere
preceded religion," <span id="fr_41"></span>[2](#fn_41.md) he also avows
that the antagonism between the two

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">seems to have made its appearance comparatively
*late in the history of religion*. At an earlier stage the functions of
priest and sorcerer were often combined, or, to speak perhaps more
correctly, were not yet differentiated from each other. To serve his
purpose, man wooed the good-will of gods or spirits by prayer and
sacrifice, while *at the same time* he had recourse to ceremonies and
forms of words which he hoped would of themselves bring about the
desired result without the help of god or devil. In short, he performed
religious and magical rites *simultaneously;* he uttered prayers and
incantations almost in the same breath, knowing or reeking little of the
theoretical inconsistency of his behaviour, so long as by hook or crook
he contrived to get what he wanted. <span
id="fr_42"></span>[3](#fn_42.md)</span>

</div>

Proceeding with his ostensible support of the thesis that magic
*preceded* religion, Dr. Frazer, in his admirably learned way, gives us
fresh illustrations of the "*same confusion of* magic and religion" in
civilised and uncivilised peoples. <span id="fr_43"></span>[4](#fn_43.md)
From Dr. Oldenberg he cites the observation that

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"the ritual of the very sacrifices for which the
metrical prayers were composed is described in the older Vedic texts as
saturated from beginning to end with magical practices which were to be
carried out by the sacrificial priests"; and that the Brahmanic rites of
marriage initiation and king-anointing "are complete models of magic of
every kind, and in every case the form of magic employed bears the stamp
of the highest antiquity." <span id="fr_44"></span>[5](#fn_44.md)</span>

</div>

From Sir Gaston Maspero he accepts the weighty reminder that in regard
to ancient Egypt

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">we ought not to attach to the word "magic" the
degrading idea which it almost inevitably calls up in the mind of a
modern. Ancient magic was the very foundation of religion. The faithful
who desired to obtain some favour from a god had no chance of succeeding
except by laying hands on the deity; and this arrest could only be
effected by means of a certain number of rites, sacrifices, prayers, and
chants, *which the god himself had revealed*, and which obliged him to
do what was demanded of him. <span id="fr_45"></span>[6](#fn_45.md)</span>

</div>

A closely similar state of things is seen in the practice of the Maoris,
who, when using coercive spells "to compel the Gods to

<span id="page_14">p. 14</span>

yield to their wishes, added sacrifices and offerings at the same time
to appease as it were their anger for being thus constrained." And the
missionary who on these data represents the Maoris as rather coercing
their Gods than praying to them, puts their usage on all fours with that
of many French Catholics. <span id="fr_46"></span>[1](#fn_46.md)

To all this, obviously, Dr. Jevons may reply that it does not prove the
*priority* of magic to religion. <span id="fr_47"></span>[2](#fn_47.md)
Neither, however, does it give any basis for Dr. Jevons’s thesis of the
secondariness of magic. It simply sets forth that in the earliest
available records, as in the practice of contemporary savages, magic
so-called and propitiatory religion so-called co-exist and cohere. In
Dr. Frazer's own words, they were not yet differentiated from each
other—differentiated, that is, in the moral estimate of priest and
worshipper. But in the terms of the proposition, the practice of
propitiation *was there;* and there is nothing to show that it was a
late variation on confident magic. On the other hand, the documentary
evidence, so far as it goes, is in favour of the priority of magic
so-called. "The magical texts formed the earliest sacred literature of
Chaldæa. This fact remains unshaken." <span
id="fr_48"></span>[3](#fn_48.md)

What, then, becomes of the argument that magic and religion so-called
are "opposed" because they are logically inconsistent with each other?
Like Dr. Jevons, Dr. Frazer makes a good deal of the theoretic analogy
of magic with science, both being alleged to rest upon the assumption of
the "uniformity of nature" and "the operation of immutable laws acting
mechanically." <span id="fr_49"></span>[4](#fn_49.md) Now, while we need
not hesitate to see in magic in particular, even as in religion in
general, man's early gropings towards science, we must not let ourselves
be by a mere verbalism confused as to what magic is. Obviously it does
*not* assume the uniformity of nature; inasmuch as it assumes to control
nature by different devices, framing

<span id="page_15">p. 15</span>

new procedures where the old fail. It does not even invariably assume
strict uniformity in the magical *processus* itself; but that is the one
sort of uniformity of cause and effect that the magician as approaches
to conceiving. Now, this conception connects much less with that of what
we may term the normal relation of man to nature than with that of his
relation to the sets of forces apprehended by late thought as
"spiritual," but by early thought merely as unseen. Early man,
presumably, had a normal notion of the process of breaking a stone or
killing a foe; and there if anywhere lay the beginnings of his science.
As Adam Smith put it, "Fire burns and water refreshes, heavy bodies
descend, and lighter substances fly upwards, by the necessity of their
own nature; nor was the invisible hand of Jupiter ever apprehended to be
employed in those matters." <span id="fr_50"></span>[1](#fn_50.md) As Comte
put it, primitive man never made a god of weight. <span
id="fr_51"></span>[2](#fn_51.md) But even as he thought the invisible or
inferrible personalities could do many kinds of "great" things, so he
thought that, by taking pains, *he* could; inasmuch as he never clearly
differentiated them from himself in nature and capacity. Thus his magic
was part of his way of thinking about what was for him the "occult" or
inferred side of things, which way of thinking as a whole *was* his
religion. To speak in terms of Dr. Jevons’s primary position, he was as
magician *interfering with* the sequences of nature as he supposed the
occult personalities did.

On yet another ground, we are disallowed from charging inconsistency on
primitive or ancient religious thought in respect of divergences from
later conceptions. One of the more notable of those divergences is the
idea that the Gods themselves are subject to the course of Nature, or
the law of Fate: it is reached by modern Native Americans, <span
id="fr_52"></span>[3](#fn_52.md) as it was by some ancient Egyptians, <span
id="fr_53"></span>[4](#fn_53.md) and it stands out from the religious
speculation of ancient Greece. <span id="fr_54"></span>[5](#fn_54.md) In
both stages it is compatible with propitiation; and yet it gives a
quasi-logical basis for the resort to magic, regarded as a temporary
circumvention of the law of things. So with the belief in opposed
deities: even if

<span id="page_16">p. 16</span>

none be regarded as evil, like Ahriman, there is nothing specially
inconsistent in a magic that seeks to employ a power of which, in the
terms of the case, no deity has a monopoly. On this basis polytheism
offers an easy way out of the indictment for inconsistency. When
Porphyry asked Abammon, "Does not he who says he will burst the heavens,
or reveal the secrets of Isis, or expose the arcanum in the adytum, or
scatter the members of Osiris to Typhon—does not he who says this, by
thus threatening what he knows not and cannot do, prove himself grossly
foolish?"—the sage answers with confidence that such threats are used
against not any of the celestial Gods but a lower order of powers, and
that the theurgist commands these "as existing superior to them in the
order of the Gods," and possessing power "through a union with the Gods"
in virtue of his magic. <span id="fr_55"></span>[1](#fn_55.md)

That is, of course, a late and sophisticated account of the matter the
earlier theologian simply did not realise that any charge of
inconsistency could arise. In any case, the Old Testament abounds in
cases of sympathetic magic: the sprinkling of the blood of the hallowed
sacrifice upon the ears and thumbs and toes of the priests; <span
id="fr_56"></span>[2](#fn_56.md) the holding up of the arms of Moses, <span
id="fr_57"></span>[3](#fn_57.md) in the attitude of the Sun-God and War-God
Mithra, <span id="fr_58"></span>[4](#fn_58.md) to sway the battle; the
sending forth of the scape-goat; <span id="fr_59"></span>[5](#fn_59.md) the
blowing of the trumpets before the walls of Jericho; <span
id="fr_60"></span>[6](#fn_60.md) the raising of the widow's son by Elijah,
"stretching himself upon the child three times" <span
id="fr_61"></span>[7](#fn_61.md)—all these are acts neither of prayer nor
of propitiation, but of sympathetic magic, "which is the germ of all
magic"; and the theorist may be defied to show that they stood for a
"degradation or relapse in the evolution of religion." <span
id="fr_62"></span>[8](#fn_62.md) If, indeed, he could show it, he would be
putting a rod in pickle for his theory of the super-excellence of Hebrew
monotheism, which evolved itself with these accompaniments.

The early priest, then, is to be called inconsistent in his resort to
magic only on the view that he had the definite modern conception of the
*Omnipotence* of a supernatural power; and this he simply had not. It
is, then, quite beside the case to argue, as does even Dr. Frazer, <span
id="fr_63"></span>[9](#fn_63.md) that "the fatal flaw of magic lies in its
total misconception of the particular laws which govern" natural
sequences. *That* is not a differentiation between magic and religion;
for the "religious" conception that nature is to be affected by
propitiating

<span id="page_17">p. 17</span>

unseen powers is just as fatally wrong; and it arose in the same fashion
by "association of ideas," men assuming that nature was ruled by a
personality like themselves. Why, then, is the "flaw" dwelt upon? If it
be to prepare for the view that at a certain stage a portion of mankind
began to "*abandon* magic as a principle of faith and practice and to
betake themselves to religion *instead*," <span
id="fr_64"></span>[1](#fn_64.md) the answer is that on Dr. Frazer's own
showing men for whole ages practised both concurrently; <span
id="fr_65"></span>[2](#fn_65.md) and that in the terms of the case they are
as likely to have taken to magic because prayer failed as *vice versa*.
Dr. Frazer, indeed, only diffidently suggests that "a tardy recognition
of the inherent falsehood and barrenness of magic set the more
thoughtful part of mankind to cast about for a truer theory of nature
and a more fruitful method of turning her resources to account." But by
his own showing he has no right to this hypothesis even on an avowal of
diffidence. As well might the contrary theory of Dr. Jevons be supported
by the suggestion that the inherent falsehood and barrenness of the
theory of prayer and propitiation set the more resourceful part of
mankind on a more effectual control of nature by way of magic. <span
id="fr_66"></span>[3](#fn_66.md) Had not men all along been trying both?

Equally untenable, surely, is the distinction drawn by Dr. Frazer <span
id="fr_67"></span>[4](#fn_67.md) between "the haughty self-sufficiency of
the magician, his arrogant demeanour towards the higher powers, and his
unabashed claim to exercise a sway like theirs," and the attitude of the
priest "with his awful sense of the divine majesty and his humble
prostration in presence of it." Dr. Frazer can hardly mean to be
ironical; but his words may very well serve to convey such a sense when
applied to the attitude of the priesthoods of all ages,
Brahmanical <span id="fr_68"></span>[5](#fn_68.md) or Papal, Semitic or
Aryan. It would be difficult to distinguish in the matter of modesty
between Moses <span id="fr_69"></span>[6](#fn_69.md) and the magicians of
Pharaoh, or Samuel and the Witch of Endor, or Elijah and the priests of
Baal, or an excommunicating and flag-blessing bishop and an incantating
wizard.

<span id="page_18">p. 18</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> All the while we
have Dr. Frazer's own assurance that for long ages the priest *was* the
magician.

If, seeking to form a just judgment, we turn to actual evidence for the
attitude of the primitive magician, it lies to our hand in Livingstone's
account of the negro rain-doctors of Bechuanaland. Here we have a
typical dialogue between the missionary and the magician. The latter
complained in friendly fashion to the missionary, "You see we never get
rain, while those tribes who never pray as we do \[*i.e.*, Christian
fashion\] obtain abundance." "This," the missionary confesses, "was a
fact; and we often saw it raining on the hills ten miles off, while it
would not look at us 'even with one eye.'" When the rain-doctor set to
work, on the score that "the whole country needs the rain I am making,"
there ensues the argument:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

"*M.D.* \[*i.e.*, Livingstone\] . So you really believe that you can
command the clouds? I think that can be done by God alone.

"*Rain Doctor*. We both believe the very same thing. It is God that
makes the rain, *but I pray to him by means of these medicines*, and,
the rain coming, of course it is then mine......

"*M.D.* But we are distinctly told in the parting words of our Saviour
that we can pray to God acceptably in his name alone, and not by means
of medicines.

"*R.D.* Truly! but God told *us* differently. He made black men first,
and did not love us as he did the white men......Other tribes place
medicines about our country to prevent the rain, so that we may be
dispersed by hunger and go to them and augment their power. We must
dissolve their charms by our medicines. God has given us one little
thing which you know nothing of. He has given us the knowledge of
certain medicines by which we can make rain. *We* do not despise those
things which *you* possess, though we are ignorant of them. You ought
not to despise our little knowledge, though you are ignorant of it."

"This \[adds Livingstone\] is a brief specimen of their mode of
reasoning, which is often remarkably acute. I never succeeded in
convincing a single individual of the fallacy of his belief; and the
usual effect of discussion is to produce the impression that you
yourself are not anxious for rain." <span id="fr_70"></span>[1](#fn_70.md)

</div>

Quite so. How could the missionary hope to convince the rain-needy?
Delusion for delusion, which was the more "religious"? And which was the
plainer "fallacy" of the two fashions of prayer? The true solution of
the problem is that set forth in the essay

<span id="page_19">p. 19</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> *Sur le totemisme*
of M. Durkheim, <span id="fr_71"></span>[1](#fn_71.md) who may be supposed
to speak for scientific sociology if any one does. In that essay he
deals incidentally with the view of Dr. Frazer that the Australian
Aruntas <span id="fr_72"></span>[2](#fn_72.md) are at the stage of pure
magic, not having yet reached religion. Dr. Jevons, on the contrary,
would regard them as truly religious in respect of their totem
sacrament. M. Durkheim, applying the inductive method, notes
indeed <span id="fr_73"></span>[3](#fn_73.md) that the life of the Aruntas
is "stamped with religiosity, and that this religiosity is in origin
essentially totemic"; but he adds: "The territory is covered with sacred
trees, and groves, and mysterious grottos, where are piously preserved
the objects of the cult. None of those sacred places is approached
without a religious terror." And he concludes: "What is essential is
that the rites of the Aruntas are at all points comparable to those
which are found in systems incontestably religious: then they proceed
from *the same ideas and the same sentiments;* and it is arbitrary to
refuse them the same title."

The final condemnation of Dr. Frazer's definition, however, is, as we
shall see cause later to say of that of Dr. Jevons, that in strictness
it ignores the bulk of the religious life of mankind. He himself avows
that only a part of mankind has ever abandoned magic and taken to
"religion instead." In his own words, magic is a "universal faith," a
"truly Catholic creed"; <span id="fr_74"></span>[4](#fn_74.md) and he
might, without extending his ample anthropological learning, further
establish this fact by reference to current religion. If religion is to
mean only the ideas of "the more thoughtful part of mankind," we shall
simply be committed to a new inquiry as to who are the more thoughtful;
and the agnostic will have something to say on that head.

Are they the believers in the efficacy of prayer? Insofar as such
believers profess belief in an Omnipotent and Unchanging Providence,
they stultify their theistic creed as vitally as ever did the magician.
Prayer presupposes the changeableness of a Divine will declared to be
unchangeable. Then prayer, like magic, is fundamentally opposed to
belief in an omnipotent deity! Where shall we stop? Dr. Frazer <span
id="fr_75"></span>[5](#fn_75.md) supposes the reader to ask, "How was it
that intelligent men did not sooner detect the fallacy of magic?"; and
he thoughtfully and rightly answers that before the age of science it
was really not easy to detect. But he could hardly say as much of
prayer, whereof the "fallacy" was detected among

<span id="page_20">p. 20</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Hebrews and
heathens thousands of years ago. Yet by his definition the contemporary
believer in prayer is religious and the ancient worshipper of Isis was
not. On such principles there can be no science of religion whatever,
any more than there is a science of orthodoxy. In order to classify the
very phenomena with which Dr. Frazer mainly occupies himself, we should
have to create a new set of terms for nine-tenths of them, recognising
"religion" only as a certain procedure that chronically obtruded itself
among them. And then would come Dr. Jevons to explain that this religion
was not a religion at all, inasmuch as it resulted from a process of
reasoning!

Science, then, is driven to reject both apriorisms alike, and to proceed
to find a definition by way of a loyal induction.

<span id="fn_47"></span>[14:2](pch09.htm#fr_47.md) For that thesis there is
some support in the testimonies which limit the "religion" of some

and Gillen there is hardly anything else in the mental apparatus of many
tribes of Australian aborigines. Cp. A. E. Pratt, *Two Years Among New
Guinea Cannibals*, 1906, pp. 314-7; Knud Rasmussen, *The People of the
Polar North*, 1908, pp. 123-5. Mr. Pratt pronounces that "the most
elementary ideas of religion do not seem to exist" among the Papuans,
who practise a little magic; and Mr. Rasmussen says the Eskimos worship
no deity, but merely dread a collective evil power, which they
propitiate by observance of customs. Cp. further L. Decle, *Three Years

<span id="fn_49"></span>[14:4](pch09.htm#fr_49.md) Dr. Frazer further
writes (p. 61) that in both "the elements of caprice, of chance, and of
accident are banished from the course of nature." This is a further and
a gratuitous logical confusion. Magic certainly recognises "caprice" in
its "nature"; and science certainly notes "chance" and "accident," which
are not negations of, but aspects of, the uniformity of nature. Where
could science place them, save in nature, if she recognises them; and if
she does not recognise them, how can she name or banish them? As to the

the discussion  seems wanting. Cp. H. N. Coleridge, *Introduction to the
Study of the Greek Classic Poets*, Pt. i, 2nd ed. 1834, pp. 184-187: and
Ueberweg, *History of Philosophy*, Eng. trans. i, 194-196. V. Fabricius,
in his essay *De Jove et Fato in p. Vergili Aeneide* (1896, p. 21), sums
up: "Nullo Vergili carminis loco Jovem fato subiectum esse plane ac
clare dici nobis confitendum est. Sunt quidem nonnulla quibus Jovis
potentia et fati vis simul dominari videntur." This coincides with the
summary of H. N. Coleridge as to Homer.

Researches*, 2nd ed. iv, 294-5, where it is noted that the islanders try
different priests and sorcerers as more civilised people try different
doctors. "The sorcerers were a distinct class among the priests of the
island; and their art appears to claim equal antiquity with the other
parts of that cruel system of idolatry," etc. (Cp. i, iii, 36-37.) The
difference is simply socio-political: the sorcerer is an independent
performer who does not run a God or a temple.
