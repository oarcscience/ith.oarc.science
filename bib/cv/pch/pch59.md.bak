#### § 14. The Problem of Manichæus.

On the fringes of the historical problem of Buddhism there lies one
which is worth at least a passing scrutiny in this connection—that,
namely, of the origins of the heretical quasi-Christian sect of
Manichæans. The Christian tradition runs that one Scythianos, a Saracen,
husband of an Egyptian woman, "introduced the doctrine of Empedocles and
Pythagoras into Christianity"; that he had a disciple, "Buddas, formerly
named Terebinthus," who travelled in Persia, where he alleged that he
had been born of a virgin, and afterwards wrote four books, one Of
Mysteries, a second The Gospel, a third The Treasure, and a fourth
Heads. While performing some mystic rites, he was hurled down a
precipice by a daimon, and killed. A woman at whose house he lodged
buried him, took over his property, and bought a boy of seven, named
Cubricus. This boy she freed and educated, leaving him the property and
books of Buddas-Terebinthus. Cubricus then travelled into Persia, where
he took the name of Manes and gave forth the doctrines of Buddas
Terebinthus as his own. The king of Persia \[not named\], hearing that
he worked miracles, sent for him to heal his sick son, and on the
child's dying put Manes in prison. Thence he escaped, flying into
Mesopotamia, but was traced, captured, and flayed alive by the Persian
king's orders, the skin being then stuffed with chaff and hung up before
the gate of the city. <span id="fr_1308"></span>[1](#fn_1308.md)

For this narrative, the historian Socrates, writing in the fifth
century, gives as his authority "The Disputation \[with Manes\] of
Archelaus bishop of Caschar," a work either unknown to or disregarded by
Eusebius, who in his History briefly vilifies Manes <span
id="fr_1309"></span>[2](#fn_1309.md) without giving any of the above
details. In the Chronicon of Eusebius the origin of the sect is placed
in the second year of Probus, C.E. 277; but this passage is probably
from the hand of Jerome. <span id="fr_1310"></span>[3](#fn_1310.md)
According to Jerome, Archelaus wrote his account of his Disputation with
"Manichæus" in Syriac, whence it was translated into Greek. The Greek is
lost, and the work, apart from extracts, subsists only in a Latin
translation from the Greek, of doubtful age and fidelity, <span
id="fr_1311"></span>[4](#fn_1311.md) probably made after the fifth century.
By Photius it is stated that Heraclean, bishop of Chalcedon, in his book
against the Manichæans, said the \[Greek\] Disputation of Archelaus was

<span id="page_265">p. 265</span>

written by one Hegemonius—an author not otherwise traceable, and of
unknown date.

In the Latin narrative, "Manes" is said to have come, after his flight
from court, from Arabion, a frontier fortress, to Caschar or Carchar, a
town said to be in Roman Mesopotamia, in the hope of converting an
eminent Christian there, named Marcellus, to whom he had sent a letter
beginning: "Manichæus apostle of Jesus Christ, and all the saints and
virgins with me, send peace to Marcellus." In his train he brought
twenty-two \[or twelve\] youths and virgins. At the request of
Marcellus, he debated on religion with bishop Archelaus, by whom he was
vanquished; whereupon he set out to return to Persia. On his way he
proposed to debate with a priest at the town of Diodorides; but
Archelaus came to take the priest's place, and again defeated him;
whereupon, fearing to be given up to the Persians by the Christians, he
returned to Arabion. At this stage Archelaus introduces in a discourse
to the people his history of "this Manes," very much to the effect of
the recapitulation in Socrates. Among the further details are these: (1)
that Scythianus lived "in the time of the Apostles"; (2) that
Terebinthus said the name of Buddas had been imposed on him; (3) that in
the mountains he had been brought up by an angel; (4) that he had been
convicted of imposture by a Persian prophet named Parcus, and by
Labdacus, son <span id="fr_1312"></span>[1](#fn_1312) of Mithra; (5.md)
that in the disputation he taught concerning the sphere, the two
luminaries, the transmigration of souls, and the war of the "Principia"
against God; (6) that "Corbicius" or Corbicus, about the age of sixty,
translated the books of Terebinthus; (7) that he made three chief
disciples, Thomas, Addas, and Hermas, of whom he sent the first to
Egypt, and the second to Scythia, keeping the third with him; (8) that
the two former returned when he was in prison, and that he sent them to
procure for him the books of the Christians, which he then studied.
According to the Latin narrative, finally, Manes on his return to
Arabion was seized and taken to the Persian king, by whose orders he was
flayed, his body being left to the birds, and his skin, filled with air,
hung at the city gate.

That this narrative is historically worthless is admitted by all
critical students since Beausobre; and recent historians turn from the
Christian to the oriental accounts of the heresiarch for a credible
view. There "Mani" is described as a painter, <span
id="fr_1313"></span>[2](#fn_1313.md) who set up a

<span id="page_266">p. 266</span>

sectarian movement in opposition to Zoroastrianism, then in renewed
favour in Persia, in the reign of Shapur I. Being proceeded against, he
fled to Turkestan, where he made disciples and embellished with
paintings a Tchighil \[Chinese name for a temple or *Picturarum Domus*\]
and another temple called Ghalbita. Provisioning in advance a cave which
had a spring, he told his disciples he was going to heaven, and would
not return for a year, after which time they were to seek him in the
cave in question. They then and there found him, whereupon he showed
them an illustrated book, called Ergenk, or Estenk, which he said he had
brought from heaven: whereafter he had many followers, with whom he
returned to Persia at the death of Shapur. The new king, Hormisdas,
joined and protected the sect; and built Mani a castle. The next king,
Bahram or Varanes, at first favoured Mani; but, after getting him to
debate with certain Zoroastrian teachers, caused him to be flayed alive,
and the skin to be stuffed and hung up as alleged by the
Christians. <span id="fr_1314"></span>[1](#fn_1314.md) Thereupon most of
his followers fled to India, and some even to China, those remaining
being reduced to slavery.

In yet another Mohammedan account we have the details that Mani's mother
was named Meis or Utachin, or Mar Marjam (Sancta Maria); and that he was
supernaturally born. <span id="fr_1315"></span>[2](#fn_1315.md) At the
behest of an angel he began his public career, with two companions, at
the age of twenty-four, on a Sunday, the first day of Nisan, when the
sun was in Aries. He travelled for about forty years; wrote *six* books,
and was raised to Paradise after being slain under Bahram "son of
Shapur." Some say he was crucified "in two halves" and so hung up at two
gates, afterwards called High-Mani and Low-Mani; others that he was
imprisoned by Shapur and freed by Bahram; others that he died in prison.
"But he was certainly crucified." <span
id="fr_1316"></span>[3](#fn_1316.md)

Thus the sole detail which the Mohammedan and Christian writers have in
common is that of the execution with its exemplary sequel.

Both accounts, it will be observed, make Mani an innovating heretic; but
the Persian treats him as inventing his doctrine, while the Christian
makes it traditive. The Persian story, however,

<span id="page_267">p. 267</span>

makes him compose and illustrate his book in Turkestan, with the
possible implication that such a book was a novelty in Persia, despite
Mani's profession. Baur and Neander, accordingly, combining the
Christian clue of the name Buddas with the Persian clue to Turkestan,
infer that in that territory Mani acquired a knowledge of
Buddhism. <span id="fr_1317"></span>[1](#fn_1317.md) To this solution,
however, there are several objections. In the first place, there are in
Manichæism only shadowy analogies to Buddhism; and in the second, the
name *Buddas* is plausibly interpreted as being merely a Greek
corruption of *Butm* or *Budm*, the Chaldaic name of the terebinth
tree—a simple translation of Terebinthus. <span
id="fr_1318"></span>[2](#fn_1318.md) On the other hand, Ritter has
conjectured that "Terebinthus" may be a corruption of Buddha's title
"Tere Hintu," Lord of the Hindus. Finally, it has to be noted that
Herodotus repeatedly mentions a people called the *Budini*, <span
id="fr_1319"></span>[3](#fn_1319.md) among whom were settled the Neuri, who
"seem to be magicians"; so that "Buddas" might be a reminiscence of
*their* repute. We have thus a pleasing variety of choices!
