#### § 15. The Manichean Solution.

Seeking for a solution, we may assume that whatever tradition the
Christians had concerning Manes they got from the east; and it is
conceivable that from the datum of Turkestan they evolved the ideas of
"Scythianus" and "Buddas," with or without the help of the knowledge
that "Budh" might stand for "Terebinthus" in Chaldea. <span
id="fr_1320"></span>[4](#fn_1320.md) But the Persian tradition in itself
has little weight, being merely a way of saying that Mani's doctrine had
associations with other lands. On the face of the story, he was
heretical before he left Persia; and the medley of theosophic doctrines
associated with Manichæism can be traced on the one hand to the general
storehouse of Babylonian lore, whence came the lore of Christian
Gnosticism, and on the other hand to Mazdeism. Such an amalgamation
could very well take place on the frontiers of the Persian and Roman
empires, early in the Christian era. But it has to be asked how and why
Manichæism, which at so many points resembles the Gnostic systems
so-called, should have held its ground as a cult while they were
suppressed. Its Jesus and Christ were as far as theirs from conforming
to the doctrines of the Church, and it was furiously

<span id="page_268">p. 268</span>

persecuted for centuries. The explanation apparently lies in the element
of cultus, the exaltation of the Founder. Was this then a case in which
an abnormal Teacher really founded a religion by his doctrine and the
force of his personality?

In order to form an opinion we have first to note two outstanding
features of Manichæism—the doctrine that Manichæus was "the Paraclete";
and the fact that his quasi-crucifixion was devoutly commemorated by his
devotees in the *Bema* festival at the season of the Christian
Easter. <span id="fr_1321"></span>[1](#fn_1321.md) Concerning the first
datum, the most significant consideration is that the equivalence of the
names Mani or Manes and Manichæus is to be explained only on Usher's
theory that they are both variants of an eastern name equivalent to the
Hebrew name *Menahem*, which has in part the same meaning as
Paraclete. <span id="fr_1322"></span>[2](#fn_1322.md) Seeing that Manes is
declared to have called himself the Paraclete promised in the Christian
gospel, the question arises whether he was in Syria called Menahem =
*Manichaios* on this account, or whether Mani was for Persians, as was
Manes or Mane for Greeks and Romans, a passable equivalent for
*Menahem*, in which the third consonant was a guttural. And seeing that
the same name is Græcised as Manaen in the book of Acts, this appears to
be the fact. Now, the name Menahem, being framed from the root *nahem*,
often translated in the Septuagint by μενονοέω, strictly signifies only
"the comforter," and has not in Hebrew the various senses of advocate,
mediator, messenger, and intercessor, conveyed by *paraklêtos;* but
there are some reasons for holding that in post-Biblical use it may have
had a similar significance with the Greek term. In particular, we find
it in late Judaic lore practically identified with the title of Messiah,
the Messiah ben David being called the Menakhem ben Ammiel, while the
Messiah ben Joseph is named Nehemia ben Uziel. <span
id="fr_1323"></span>[3](#fn_1323.md) The Talmud brings the identification
in close touch with Jesuism. "R. Joshua ben Levi saith, His name is
*tsemach*, '*A Branch*'" \[Zech. iii, 8. *Tsemach*, it will be
remembered = *Netzer*\]. "R. Juda Bar Aibu saith, His name is
Menahem." <span id="fr_1324"></span>[4](#fn_1324.md) Jesus, it will be
remembered, becomes the *paraklêtos* in the sense of

<span id="page_269">p. 269</span>

an intercessor, being yet at the same time an atonement. <span
id="fr_1325"></span>[1](#fn_1325.md) And if there is reason to refer the
doctrine of the two Messiahs to an extra-Judaic source, <span
id="fr_1326"></span>[2](#fn_1326.md) a similar surmise is permissible as to
the two Menahems. <span id="fr_1327"></span>[3](#fn_1327.md)

In this connection we have next to note, as did Baur long ago, that the
story of Mani's concealment in the cave is a strikingly close parallel
to the old story in Herodotus concerning the reputed Thracian God
Zalmoxis or Zamolxis, of whom "some think that he is the same with
Gebelezeis." <span id="fr_1328"></span>[4](#fn_1328.md)

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Every fifth year they despatch one of themselves,
taken by lot, to Zalmoxis, with orders to let him know on each occasion
what they want. Their mode of sending him is this. Some of them are
appointed to hold three javelins; while others, having taken up the
man......by the hands and feet, swing him round, and throw him into the
air upon the points. If he should die, being transfixed, they think the
God is propitious to them; if he should not die, they blame the
messenger himself, saying that he is a bad man; and having blamed him
they despatch another." <span id="fr_1329"></span>[5](#fn_1329.md)</span>

</div>

Gebelezeis may be the Babylonian Fire-God Gibil, identified with Nusku.
In that case the sacrifice to him of a messenger is one more instance of
sacrificing the God to himself, as Gibil-Nusku was the messenger of all
the Gods. <span id="fr_1330"></span>[6](#fn_1330.md) According to the
Greeks of the Hellespont and Pontus, Zalmoxis was a man who had been a
slave, at Samos, to Pythagoras, son of Mnesarchus, then was freed,
became rich, and retired to his own country, Thrace, where he taught the
doctrine of immortality. While teaching this in a dwelling he caused to
be built, "he in the meantime had an underground dwelling made, and when
the building was finished he vanished from among the Thracians; and
having gone down to the underground dwelling he abode there three
years." In the fourth year he reappeared to the Thracians, who had
deemed him dead, and thus his teaching became credible to them. <span
id="fr_1331"></span>[7](#fn_1331.md) The good Herodotus, "neither
disbelieving nor entirely believing" the legend, was "of opinion that
this Zalmoxis lived many years before Pythagoras"; and we in turn,
seeing in the story of the three years’ stay underground

<span id="page_270">p. 270</span>

a remote form of the myth of the God-man's three days in the grave,
pronounce that the legends of the freed slave Mani and his concealment
in the cave are of similar antiquity. <span
id="fr_1332"></span>[1](#fn_1332.md) He is inferribly the *Menahem* or
messenger of the cult of the Thracian Getæ; and in another "Scythian"
record we have a clue to the legend of his death, as well as to the myth
of "Scythianus." The flaying of slain enemies was a Scythian usage; and
"many, having flayed men whole, and stretched the skin on wood, carry it
about on horseback." <span id="fr_1333"></span>[2](#fn_1333.md) As with the
enemy, so with the "messenger," <span id="fr_1334"></span>[3](#fn_1334.md)
whose function is a recognised one in barbaric sacrifice. At the death
of a king, they strangled and buried one of his concubines, a
cup-bearer, a cook, a groom, a page, a courier, and horses, "and
firstlings of everything else." A year later they strangled fifty of his
young men-servants and fifty of the finest horses, and, having
disembowelled them, *stuffed them with chaff* and sewed them up. The
bodies of the horses were then transfixed lengthwise with beams and
placed in the curves of half-wheels to support them; the bodies of the
fifty young men were similarly transfixed and mounted on the horses; and
the whole ghastly cavalcade was placed around the "high-place" made over
the king's grave. <span id="fr_1335"></span>[4](#fn_1335.md) An evolution
of such funerary and honorific sacrifices into sacrifices to the Gods is
in the normal way of religious history. In modern Dahome, again, it was
*de rigueur* that every occurrence at court should be reported to the
spirit of the king's father by a male or female messenger, who was
commonly though not always sacrificed. <span
id="fr_1336"></span>[5](#fn_1336.md)

The Thracian Getæ, who carried on the cult of Zalmoxis and the ritually
slain messenger, were subdued by Darius, and embodied in his
empire, <span id="fr_1337"></span>[6](#fn_1337.md) with other Scythian
tribes; and in that vast aggregate their sacrificial rites had the usual
chance of being adopted by their conquerors—if indeed they were not
already associated with the worship of Gibil-Nusku the Babylonian
Fire-God, and so known to the Persian fire-worshippers. And, whether or
not by way of such an adoption, we find that after the death of the
captive emperor Valerian his skin was *dyed red and stuffed with straw*,
and was so preserved for centuries in the chief temple of

<span id="page_271">p. 271</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Persia <span
id="fr_1338"></span>[1](#fn_1338.md)—a course strongly suggestive of
religious symbolism. By certain Arab tribes, who worshipped the star
Mars, a warrior in blood-stained garments was annually sacrificed by
being thrown into a pit; and the God was worshipped in a temple of red
colour <span id="fr_1339"></span>[2](#fn_1339.md)—a kindred conception.
Such a proceeding as the Persian, in fact, would have been impossible in
a temple without religious precedent; and in the sacrificial practices
of the pre-Christian Mexicans, which we find so many reasons for tracing
back to an ancient Asiatic centre, <span
id="fr_1340"></span>[3](#fn_1340.md) we find clear duplicates of both
details of the quasi-sacrifice of Valerian, together with the
messenger-sacrifices of the Khonds and Getæ. On the one hand it is
recorded that the Mexican "knights of the sun" on a certain day
sacrificed to the Sun a human victim whom they "smeared all over with
some red substance......They sent him to the Sun with the
message......that his Knights remained at his service, and gave him
infinite thanks for the great.....favours bestowed on them in the
wars." <span id="fr_1341"></span>[4](#fn_1341.md) So, again, in the
sacrifice to Xiuhteuctli the Fire-God in the tenth month the victims
were painted red. <span id="fr_1342"></span>[5](#fn_1342.md) On the other
hand, in a great annual festival held on the last day of the first
month, in which a hundred slaves were sacrificed, some were flayed, and
their skins were worn in a religious dance by leading devotees, among
them being the king. Finally the bodies were sacramentally eaten, and
the skins, "filled with cotton-wool, or straw," were "hung in the temple
and king's palace for a memorial." <span
id="fr_1343"></span>[6](#fn_1343.md) The stuffed skin of the victim, then,
was sacrosanct, <span id="fr_1344"></span>[7](#fn_1344.md) and that which
had been worn by the king was doubtless specially so, representing as it
did at once the deified victim and the monarch. When the king took a
captive in war with his own hands, the latter was specially regarded as
the representative of the sun, and was clothed with the Sun-God's royal
insignia. <span id="fr_1345"></span>[8](#fn_1345.md) As for the
red-painting of the messenger sent to the Sun,

<span id="page_272">p. 272</span>

that in turn was presumably a special symbolical identification of the
victim with the God, <span id="fr_1346"></span>[1](#fn_1346.md) as in the
peculiar Peruvian sacrifice of a shorn sheep "in a red waistcoat" to the
Sun-God at Cuzco; <span id="fr_1347"></span>[2](#fn_1347.md) and the final
inference is that the dead or slain body of the captive emperor Valerian
was made to figure as a sacrificial special Messenger sent by the
Persian king to the (messenger) Sun-God, and dedicated to that deity.

That the legendary "crucifixion" of "Manichæus" was a myth derived from
such a sacrifice is the more probable in view of the evolution of the
Christian mystery-drama from an analogous rite. <span
id="fr_1348"></span>[3](#fn_1348.md) Clemens Alexandrinus, following
another authority than Herodotus, tells how "a barbarous nation, not
cumbered with philosophy, select, it is said, *annually* an ambassador
to the hero Zamolxis," <span id="fr_1349"></span>[4](#fn_1349.md) choosing
one held to be *of special virtue*. The usage would thus seem to have
made headway after the time of Herodotus. Clemens, <span
id="fr_1350"></span>[5](#fn_1350.md) too, identifies with Zoroaster that Er
son of Armenius who in Plato figures as "the messenger from the other
world," <span id="fr_1351"></span>[6](#fn_1351.md) having gone thither in a
death-swoon; a suggestion that at least the Persians now connected the
doctrine of immortality with some conception or usage resembling that of
the Getæ; and Zoroaster, in turn, was mythically associated with a cave
containing flowers and fountains, the whole symbolical of the world, and
further associated with resurrection in the mysteries. <span
id="fr_1352"></span>[7](#fn_1352.md) Finally, the Manichæans’ annual
celebration of the *Bema*, their name for the rite commemorative of the
death of Manichæus, carries with it no explanation; and must be taken as
the title of some Græco-Oriental mystery-ritual. The word signifies
"platform," referring not to the ordinary *Bema* of the Christian
churches, wherein stood the altar, but to the covered platform of five
steps prepared by the Manichæan devotees on the anniversary of the
Founder's death; <span id="fr_1353"></span>[8](#fn_1353.md) but it is not
accounted for by any item in the legendary biography, where no such
platform is mentioned.

Upon the platform described by Augustine something must have been
represented or enacted; and as he appears never to have been one of the
*electi*, but only an *auditor* or catechumen, he would be, as the
Manichæans declared, unacquainted with the special mysteries of the
system. <span id="fr_1354"></span>[9](#fn_1354.md) The "five steps" point
to a symbol of the proto-Chaldean

<span id="page_273">p. 273</span>

high-place or temple-pyramid and altar of sacrifice, often of five
stages; <span id="fr_1355"></span>[1](#fn_1355.md) and the mystery was in
all likelihood akin to the early mystery-drama of the Christian
crucifixion. The apparent identification of the birthday of Manichæus,
in the late Mohammedan account, with the death-day in the known
cultus; <span id="fr_1356"></span>[2](#fn_1356.md) and further the
symbolism of his public appearance "with two others," suggest a mystic
scene analogous to the triple crucifixion. In any case the graded or
terraced pyramid, which was at once the norm of a sacrificial
altar <span id="fr_1357"></span>[3](#fn_1357.md) and the norm of the
temples of Babylonia, Mexico, and the South Sea Islands, was also the
norm of regal tombs, as instanced by that of Cyrus, still extant. <span
id="fr_1358"></span>[4](#fn_1358.md)

The critical presumption, then, is that the flayed and stuffed Manichæus
is one more figure Evemerised out of a rite of annual sacrifice; and
that the Manichæan cult is no more the creation of a man named Manes
than is the Buddhist the creation of one Buddha, or the Christian of one
Jesus called the Christ. It is a syncretism on the lines of those other
cults, borrowing ideas from at least three theosophic sources; combining
a nominal Christism with a modified Mithraism; <span
id="fr_1359"></span>[5](#fn_1359.md) and assimilating both, in the doctrine
that "Jesus hangs on every tree," to the esoteric side of the cult of
Dionysos. <span id="fr_1360"></span>[6](#fn_1360.md) The works ascribed to
Mani, so far as known, have every mark of being late concoctions, on
Gnostic lines, framed for purposes of proselytism in the Christian
sphere, each purporting to be written by "Manichæus, an apostle of Jesus
Christ," <span id="fr_1361"></span>[7](#fn_1361.md) in the manner of the
Christian epistles. The "Epistle to the Virgin Menoch," of which
fragments are preserved by Augustine in the *Opus Imperfectum*, suggests
anew the special signification of the title Manichæus. As for the
*Erteng* or *Erzeng*, specially associated in Persia with the name of
Mani, the title, it appears, simply means an illustrated book, <span
id="fr_1362"></span>[8](#fn_1362.md) and such a book is no more to be
supposed primordial in the cult than the epistles.

The success of the cult, in fine, was attained very much as was that of
Christism. Its promoters, early recognising the vital importance of
organisation, created a system of twelve chief apostles or *magistri*,
with a leader, representing the Founder, and seventy-two

<span id="page_274">p. 274</span>

bishops, <span id="fr_1363"></span>[1](#fn_1363.md) here copying actual
Judaism rather than Christian tradition; <span
id="fr_1364"></span>[2](#fn_1364.md) and, despite its discouragement of
marriage and procreation, it survived centuries of murderous persecution
in the eastern empire; finally passing on to the west, through the later
sects affected by its tradition, the germs of a new heresy in the Middle
Ages. Like the crucified Christ, as we have seen reason to think, its
Founder was an imaginary being; and so it outlasted the tough sects of
Marcion and Montanus, of which the latter was "all but victorious"
against orthodoxy. Montanus, says one record, claimed to be inspired by
the Paraclete; and his movement, being organised on ecclesiastical
lines, went far, beginning in Phrygia, where, as in Persia, the doctrine
of a Paraclete was probably pre-Christian. <span
id="fr_1365"></span>[3](#fn_1365.md)

That Montanus in turn was an imaginary personage is plausibly argued by
Schwegler; <span id="fr_1366"></span>[4](#fn_1366.md) but though some of
the adherents of the sect seem to have tended to make of him the
Paraclete, <span id="fr_1367"></span>[5](#fn_1367.md) it appears to have
been a fanatical movement founded on no particular personality, being
more commonly named Phrygian than Montanist, from its place of origin,
and offering no analogies to Manichæism save in respect of a general
asceticism. Being rather a special development of tendencies already
present in the Christian movement than a new creed, it had less lasting
power than the other, though its vogue and duration were sufficient to
prove how much of what passes for a new religious development special to
Christianity was but the exploitation of elements of ecstatic and
ascetic fanaticism abundantly present in the old pagan environment, of
which Phrygia was a typical part. <span

(i, 191-4) that the Christian story of the debate at Carchar or Caschar
in Roman Mesopotamia is an error founded on a real debate at Cascar in
Turkestan, where there was a Christian church and bishop, whereas there
was no Caschar in Roman Mesopotamia, and the only other Cascar was in
the heart of the Persian empire. But the whole story is unhistorical.

angel, and that after a time of trial the Messiah ben David appears in
triumph with Elias, we have a fairly decisive light on the doctrine that
