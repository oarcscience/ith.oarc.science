#### § 9. Specific Survivals in Judaism.

Apart from definite revivals, the memory of human sacrifice is clearly
stamped not only on the Passover but on the two other typical
sacrificial feasts of the Jews—the indeterminate sacrifice of the Red
Heifer, loosely said to have been performed only eight times since
Moses, and the annual sacrifice of a scape-goat on the Day of Atonement.
In the case of the former, which was prescribed to take place on the
Mount of Olives, the high-priest, his eldest son, and the *Messiah
Milchama*—the deputy High-Priest anointed for war—were all three
anointed with holy oil, the mark of a cross being made with it on their
foreheads. But further, in one of the two Talmudic accounts, "in
anticipation of the performance of the rite, a pregnant woman was
brought into one of the chambers of the temple, which was set apart for
the purpose, and kept there till her child was born. The child so born
was brought up within the sacred precincts, and protected from any
chance of incurring ceremonial pollution. When the time for the rite
arrived, this child was seated on a wooden litter borne by bullocks, and
conducted to the fountain of Siloah. There the child descended, and drew
water from the spring in an earthen vessel, bearing which, he was
reconducted, as he came, to the Temple." <span
id="fr_772"></span>[3](#fn_772.md) But by another account "pregnant
*women*" were brought to Jerusalem, and placed in courts built on the
rock, *with an excavation underneath*, and they and their children were
there kept "for the use of the red heifer" <span
id="fr_773"></span>[4](#fn_773.md) till the children were seven or eight
years old, when they ceased to be held ceremonially pure. Here it
becomes fairly clear that a regular supply of children-victims had
anciently been provided for sacrifice, and that the heifer was the
child's representative. Some trace of the knowledge is preserved in the
Talmud, in the dubiously significant

<span id="page_159">p. 159</span>

saying that "as the red heifer atones for sin so also does the death of
the righteous atone for sin." <span id="fr_774"></span>[1](#fn_774.md)
Being sacrificed with her face to, the south and her head to the
west, <span id="fr_775"></span>[2](#fn_775.md) the heifer was presumably
dedicated either to the setting or winter sun or to the
Moon-Goddess. <span id="fr_776"></span>[3](#fn_776.md)

By an equally clear clue in the ritual, we can reach the original
character of the sacrifice of the scapegoat, which in its official form
is clearly post-exilic. <span id="fr_777"></span>[4](#fn_777.md) In the
preparation for that, the high-priest was removed from his own house to
the council-chamber seven days in advance, and at the same time a
*sagan* or deputy was appointed who should take his place in case of his
being incapacitated. On the night before the day of sacrifice he was not
allowed to eat meat, or to sleep, being watched by the younger priests.
At that stage, "the elders of the great Sanhedrin handed him over to the
seniors of the priestly order, who escorted him to the *upper chamber*
of the house of Abtinas, <span id="fr_778"></span>[5](#fn_778.md) and there
they swore him in, *and, after bidding him farewell*, departed. In
administering the oath, they said: "My lord high-priest, we are
ambassadors of the Sanhedrin; *thou art ambassador of the Sanhedrin, and
our ambassador also*. We adjure thee, by Him who causes his name to
dwell in this house, that thou deviate not from anything we have
rehearsed to thee. Then they parted company, *both he and they
weeping*." <span id="fr_779"></span>[6](#fn_779.md) An absurd Talmudic
explanation is given for the weeping: "He wept because they suspected he
was a Sadducee; and they wept *because the penalty or false suspicion is
scourging*." <span id="fr_780"></span>[7](#fn_780.md) Whatever may have
been the historical fact concealed by the last phrase, it is
sufficiently clear that the rite was originally one of human sacrifice
in which either the priest or his deputy, the *Sagan* or *Segan*, was
put to death as

<span id="page_160">p. 160</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> "ambassador" of
the people to the God or Gods, <span id="fr_781"></span>[1](#fn_781.md)
that is, as scapegoat for their sins. And in this Sagan we probably have
the true interpretation of the Græcised term *Zoganes* <span
id="fr_782"></span>[2](#fn_782.md) applied to the mock victim of the Sacæa.
He was simply the deputy <span id="fr_783"></span>[3](#fn_783.md) of the
originally due victim, the priest, who must thus have solved his
personal problem at a very early date. <span
id="fr_784"></span>[4](#fn_784.md)

In all likelihood the Hebrews had practised some form of this rite long
before the Captivity. And as regards the later practice we have a
significant Talmudic clue, in the saying of Rabbi Eleazar that it is
lawful to slay an *Amhaaretz* (one "ignorant of the law," rustic
"pagan") on the Day of Atonement, even (?) when it falls on a Sabbath.
There were discussions on the point, and it is explained that the victim
must not be slain with a knife, as "that would necessitate a formal
benediction; but to kill him by tearing his nostrils open no benediction
is required." Another Rabbi chimes in that "Rabbi Yochanan has said that
it is lawful to split up the Amhaaretz like a fish"; "and that from the
neck too," adds yet another. <span id="fr_785"></span>[5](#fn_785.md) The
date explains the proposition. Whether as a regular and sanctioned or as
a sporadic practice, the sacrifice of a human victim on the Day of
Atonement had in all likelihood been practised at or near Jerusalem both
before and after the Return from the Captivity. <span
id="fr_786"></span>[6](#fn_786.md)

The modified sacrifice of the scapegoat, then, was but another variant
of the primordial principle of human sacrifice or "sin-offering" for the
good of the people, and is in many respects the complement of the
Passover. The Passover victim was set apart on the tenth day of the
civil New Year, which dated from spring; the Day of Atonement was the
tenth day from the ecclesiastical

<span id="page_161">p. 161</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> New Year, which,
as we have seen, began in autumn. It is probable that the latter is the
older of the two; but both hold their ground in reference to the sun's
progress, the spring festival standing for his youth and waxing period,
the autumn for his maturity and waning. That they had a common principle
in the sacrifice of a pure victim appears from the detail that in both
cases the victim before sacrifice is put in an "upper chamber," the idea
being to provide that no contamination should arise from a grave
beneath. <span id="fr_787"></span>[1](#fn_787.md) And both festivals, it is
to be noted, could be celebrated apart from the Temple, the Passover
being a domestic as well as a temple-feast, and the Day of Atonement
being celebrated in Babylon as well as at Jerusalem. <span
id="fr_788"></span>[2](#fn_788.md)

It is important to note this circumstance in view of the theoretic
universalism of the traditional rite of sacrifice, which even the Khonds
declared to be for "mankind," and on which the Gentilising Christians
founded their gospel. Jewish sacrifices were strictly national; but in
their later contacts with other races they were constantly being
attracted towards more cosmopolitan ideals. <span
id="fr_789"></span>[3](#fn_789.md) It sufficed that they had as basis the
communal idea, and that it was capable of development on popular lines.
In the legend of the slaying of Saul's seven sons they preserved the
belief (seen in force among the Moabites, and at the same time in
Israel <span id="fr_790"></span>[4](#fn_790).md) that a king's son, offered
up by and for his father, was an irresistibly potent sacrifice; and
among some sections of the Semitic race, as we have seen, there was
current the myth preserved by Eusebius from Philo of Byblos, that
Kronos, "whom the Phœnicians call Israel," adorned his son called Ieoud,
"the only," with emblems of royalty, and sacrificed him. The actuality
of such a belief among the Phœnicians is proved by the story of Maleus
crucifying his only son, crowned and robed in purple, before the walls
of Carthage, in order to conquer the city. <span
id="fr_791"></span>[5](#fn_791.md) He was fulfilling an august rite. Always
it is a typically divine or racial "father"—Kronos, Israel, Abraham

<span id="page_162">p. 162</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> —who figures in
the myths of son-sacrifice; <span id="fr_792"></span>[1](#fn_792.md) and
when it is remembered that the God-name Tammuz signified in its original
Akkadian form "the son of life," and was by the Semites interpreted to
mean "the offspring" or "only son," <span
id="fr_793"></span>[2](#fn_793.md) we are led to conclude that this
conception, bound up with that of the God's death and resurrection, had
a general and strong hold on both non-Semitic and Semitic races; for a
Hebrew cult of the dying and re-arising Tammuz was in the period before
the exile carried on in the very temple of Yahweh. <span

<span id="fn_776"></span>[159:3](pch36.htm#fr_776.md) In *Christianity and
Mythology*, 1st ed. p. 349, I connected the sacrifice of the red heifer
with the Egyptian sacrifice of a red ox to Typhon (Plutarch, *I. and O.*
31—ref. wrong in *C. and M.*). But though that also was clearly a
substitution for a human sacrifice, the sacrifice of a red *heifer* was
on the whole more likely to belong originally to a Goddess-cult, and in
Egypt all she-calves were sacred to Isis (Herod. ii, 41). On the whole
problem cp. Spencer, *De Legibus Hebræorum*, 1. ii, c. 15.

<span id="fn_777"></span>[159:4](pch36.htm#fr_777.md) The dogmatic
assertion of Bleek (*Einleit. in das alte Test.*, ed. Wellhausen, 1878,
§ 55) as to the clearly Mosaic authorship of Lev. i-vii, xi-xvi, is a
sample of the fashion in which criticism of the Pentateuch was so long
darkened. All critics now place Leviticus in the Priestly Code; and ch.
xvi is no exception. Cp. Driver, Introd. c. i, § 3; Kuenen, *The
Hexateuch*, Eng. tr. pp. 86, 312; and the Kautzsch Bible. If Lev. xvi be
pre-exilic, why is there no trace of it in Deuteronomy?

the sacred incense. See *Yoma*, ch. iii, 9. Schwab's Fr. trans. vol. v,

probably did not see its significance.

<span id="fn_780"></span>[159:7](pch36.htm#fr_780.md) Schwab seeks to make
the passage more plausible by the rendering (p. 170) that he wept at
being supposed capable of unfaithfulness to his instructions, they
because of the painful necessity of adjuring him to be faithful.
Hershon's translation is the more exact.

<span id="fn_781"></span>[160:1](pch36.htm#fr_781.md) This was clearly the
idea in the sacrifice of a man to Zamolxis by the Massagetæ. Herod. iv,
94, 95. See above, [p. 110](pch29.htm#page_110.md), *note*, as to the

Syris*, Syntag, ii, c. 13, and refs. in Schürer, *Jewish People in the
Time of Christ*, Div. II, Eng. tr. i, 257. Schürer, recognising no
problem as to the special function of the *segan* in the sacrifice,
decides that he must have been the στρατηγὸς τοῦ ἱεροῦ or "captain of
the temple" (p. 258). But this identification would not exclude the
origin above argued for.

God Azazel, see *Christianity and Mythology*, 2nd ed. pp. 320, 323.
Standing for the Goat-God = Capricorn, he probably represented the

<span id="fn_786"></span>[160:6](pch36.htm#fr_786.md) Prof. H. L. Strack,
in his learned and valuable work on *The Jew and Human Sacrifice* (Eng.
trans. 1909, p. 160), replying to the anti-Semitic ravings of Prof.
Rohling, argues that the passage first above cited "is not to be taken
literally, but is merely a proof of the fanatical hatred dividing those
learned in the law from those ignorant of it," and offers as proof of
his contention a saying of Rabbi Aqibâ on the same page of Tr. Pesachim
"When I was an Amha-ārez, I said, 'Give me a learned man that I may bite
him like an ass.'" The great mass of Dr. Strack's argument in his book
is sound, and his refutation of the malignant rubbish of the
anti-Semites is complete; but I can see no force in his reasoning here.
He has ignored the comments (above cited) on the saying of Rabbi
Eleazar, which exclude his solution.

<span id="fn_790"></span>[161:4](pch36.htm#fr_790.md) 2 Kings iii, 27. The
meaning of the sentence is that the Israelites felt the king's sacrifice
of his son must be efficacious, and so gave up the contest in despair.
Compare the story (above, p. 126) of Hamilcar's sacrifice of his son. So
in the story of the sacrifice of the sons of King Hiel as
foundation-Gods for Jericho (Josh. vi, 26; 1 Kings xvi, 34) it is
implied that a tremendous efficacy had accrued to the practice; and so
again when Maleus has sacrificed his son on a high cross in regal attire
he speedily takes Carthage (Justin, xviii, 7). Exactly the same
principle is found among the Maoris of New Zealand. A war-chief on the
verge of defeat "cut out the heart of his own son as an offering for
victory," whereafter, making a desperate onset, he and his tribe
triumphed: "the war-demon had much praise, and many men were eaten" (Old
New Zealand, by a Pakeha Maori, ed. 1900, p. 150). Cp. Bastian, *Der
Mensch*, iii, 104, as to the cases of the Norse Hakon Jarl and the
Egyptian Mahdi Mohammed Ben Amar. And see J. C. Lawson, *Modern Greek
Folklore and Ancient Greek Religion*, 1910, p. 273, as to Pausanias’
