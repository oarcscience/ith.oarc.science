#### § 10. The Pre-Christian Jesus-God.

We are thus prepared to interpret the crux set up for Christian
commentators by the ancient reading "Jesus Barabbas" in Matt. xxvii, 16,
17. That this was long the accepted reading in the ancient church is to
be gathered from Origen; <span id="fr_795"></span>[4](#fn_795.md) and the
problem has always been reckoned a puzzling one. Had Dr. Frazer noted
it, he might have seen cause to look deeper for his solution of the
problem of the simple name Barabbas in the Gospel story and in Philo.
The natural inference from the Barabbas story is that it was customary
to give up to the people about the time of the Passover a prisoner, who
was made to play a part in some rite under the name of Barabbas, "Son of
the Father"; and the reading "Jesus Barabbas" suggests that the full
name of the bearer of the part included that of "Jesus"—a detail very
likely to be suppressed by copyists as an error. Is not the proper
presumption, then, this: that the preservation of the name "Jesus
Barabbas" tells of the common association of those names in some such
rite as must be held to underlie the Gospel myth—that, in short, a
"Jesus the Son of the Father" was a figure in an old Semitic ritual of
sacrifice before the Christian era? The Syrian form of the name, Yeschu,
closely resembles the Hebrew name Yishak, which we read Isaac; and that
Isaac was in earlier myth sacrificed by his father is a fair
presumption. We have here the inferrible norm of an ancient
God-sacrifice, Abraham s original Godhood being tolerably certain, like
that of Israel. <span id="fr_796"></span>[5](#fn_796.md) In Arab legend,
Ishmael is sacrificed by his father, though apparently the sacrifice is
commuted for a ram in the manner of the story in Genesis. <span
id="fr_797"></span>[6](#fn_797.md)

<span id="page_163">p. 163</span>

As a hypothesis the proposed solution must for the present stand; but
the grounds for surmising a pre-Christian cult of a Jesus or Joshua may
here be noted. The first is the fact that the Joshua (Jesus) of the book
so named is quite certainly unhistorical, <span
id="fr_798"></span>[1](#fn_798.md) and that the narrative concerning him is
a late fabrication. We can but divine from it that, having several
attributes of the Sun-God, <span id="fr_799"></span>[2](#fn_799.md) he is
like Samson and Moses an ancient deity, latterly reduced to human
status; and as Jewish tradition has it that he began his work of
deliverance on the day fixed for the choosing of the paschal lamb, and
concluded it at the Passover, <span id="fr_800"></span>[3](#fn_800.md) it
is inferrible that his name was anciently associated with the rite and
the symbol, as well as with the similarly significant rite of
circumcision, which is connected with the Passover in the pseudo-history
of Joshua. <span id="fr_801"></span>[4](#fn_801.md) That he, who is never
mentioned by the psalmists or prophets, should not only be put on a
level with Moses as an institutor of the prime ordinances of the
Passover rite and circumcision, but should be credited with the miracle
of staying the course of the sun and moon—a prodigy beyond any ascribed
to Moses—is not to be explained save on the view that he held divine
status in the previous myth. <span id="fr_802"></span>[5](#fn_802.md) As
his name was held in special reverence among the Samaritans, who
preserved a late book ascribing to him many feats not given in the
Jewish record, the probability is that he was an Ephraimite deity,
analogous to Joseph, whose legend has such close resemblances to the
myth of Tammuz-Adonis.

No less clear is the inference from the pseudo-prediction inserted in a
list of priestly vetoes in the book of Exodus. <span
id="fr_803"></span>[6](#fn_803.md) It is there promised that an Angel, in
or on whom is the "name" of Yahweh, shall lead Israel to triumph against
the Amorites, the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the Canaanites, the
Hivites, and the Jebusites. This is the very list (lacking one) put in
Joshua's mouth as that of the conquests effected by the Lord through
him, <span id="fr_804"></span>[7](#fn_804.md) so that he is
Pseudo-historically identified with the promised Angel. <span
id="fr_805"></span>[8](#fn_805.md) That personage, again, in virtue of his
possession of the magical "name," <span id="fr_806"></span>[9](#fn_806.md)
is in the Talmud identified with the mystic Metatron, who is in turn
identifiable with the Logos. <span id="fr_807"></span>[10](#fn_807.md) Thus
the name Joshua = Jesus is

<span id="page_164">p. 164</span>

already in the Pentateuch associated with the conceptions of Logos, Son
of God, and Messiah; and it is in view of such knowledge that the
pseudo-prediction is framed. Only the hypothesis that in some
Palestinian quarters Joshua had the status of a deity can meet the case.

To the nature of that status we have certain clues which have never been
considered in correlation, Jews and Christians alike being led by their
presuppositions either to ignore or to misconceive them. One clue is, as
already noted, the evidently Judaic and pre-Christian character of the
Lamb-God Jesus in the Apocalypse. The slain God is there identified not
only with the *Logos*, <span id="fr_808"></span>[1](#fn_808.md) before the
appearance of the Fourth Gospel, and with the Mithraic or Babylonian
symbols of the Seven Spirits, but with the Alpha and the Omega; and the
accessories are markedly Semitic and Judaistic. Thus the four-and-twenty
elders play a foremost part; the twelve apostles are present only in an
interpolation; <span id="fr_809"></span>[2](#fn_809.md) and the saved are
pre-eminently Jewish. <span id="fr_810"></span>[3](#fn_810.md) Not only, in
short, is the Child-God of the dragon-story, in the twelfth chapter, not
the Christian Jesus: <span id="fr_811"></span>[4](#fn_811.md) the Jesus of
the whole book is pre-Christian, the book being in fact a Jewish
Apocalypse slightly edited for Christian purposes. <span
id="fr_812"></span>[5](#fn_812.md) So much is now admitted by many
students; and it is the failure to learn this and other lessons of the
documents that still permits of wrong hypotheses to account for the
Messianic doctrine in the Book of Enoch, a distinctly pre-Christian
work. <span id="fr_813"></span>[6](#fn_813.md)

But the same problem arises in connection with that crucial document,
"The Teaching of the Twelve Apostles." Not only are the first six
chapters of that book wholly Judaic, without mention of any divinity
save "God," "the Lord," "the Father," unless "the Spirit" be taken to
stand for a second deity; but even the formula of baptism in the seventh
chapter, which belongs to a secondary stratum in the compilation, is not
clearly Christian; and the eucharistic formula in the ninth is clearly
non-Christian. It runs: "We thank thee, our Father, for the holy vine of
David thy servant, which thou hast made known to us by Jesus thy
servant," <span id="fr_814"></span>[7](#fn_814.md) an expression quite
irreconcilable with the accepted Christian narrative and liturgy. Nor is
there a single allusion in the entire document, whether in the late or
the early portions, to the death of Jesus by

<span id="page_165">p. 165</span>

crucifixion or otherwise. Thus it appears that not only was the nucleus
of the document a teaching of twelve monotheistic *Jewish* apostles—the
apostles of the High Priest to the Dispersion <span
id="fr_815"></span>[1](#fn_815.md)—but even the earlier Jesuist additions
were made by Judaic Jesuists who had not the Christian doctrine of a
divine sacrifice, whether or not they already had the trinitarian
doctrine set forth in the baptismal formula of the seventh chapter. Thus
the allusion to the "gospel of the Lord" in the eighth chapter is
presumptively an interpolation, occurring as it does in a document in
which hitherto "the Lord" had always meant Yahweh; and even at that, the
reference is presumptively to the inferred primary form of the first
gospel, which had no account of the crucifixion and resurrection <span
id="fr_816"></span>[2](#fn_816.md)—a gospel, in short, which had grown up
solely by way of sayings and doings ascribed to the mythical Jesus,
without the existing birth legend, and without *his* twelve apostles.
Here again the theological critics recognise the Judaic character of the
matter, <span id="fr_817"></span>[3](#fn_817.md) but fail to draw the
obvious inferences.

There remains to be considered in the same connection the fact that in
the Jewish liturgy for the ecclesiastical New Year there is or was
mention of Joshua (*Jeschu* = Jesus) as "the Prince of the
Presence." <span id="fr_818"></span>[4](#fn_818.md) This is of course
interpreted as a title signifying Joshua's relation to Moses; but in the
light of the Apocalypse it seems to have quite another significance.
After the deletions effected in the pseudo-history, <span
id="fr_819"></span>[5](#fn_819.md) the matter is sufficiently obscure; but
the clues left, when colligated, tell of something very different from
the written word. Tentatively, we may surmise that as the Day of
Atonement, which comes ten days after the New Year, is the consummation
of the annual Day of Judgment, <span id="fr_820"></span>[6](#fn_820.md)
Joshua in the liturgy played very much the same part as the Judaic Jesus
in the Apocalypse.

Finally, we have to note (*a*) the remarkable Persian tradition which
makes Joshua the Son of Miriam, <span id="fr_821"></span>[7](#fn_821.md)
whose death day in the

<span id="page_166">p. 166</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Jewish calendar is
that of the beginning of his work, the tenth of Nisan, whereon was
chosen the paschal lamb; and (*b*) the fact that according to some Jews
the "Week of the Son" (circumcision and redemption of the first-born
male child) was called the rite of "Jesus the Son." <span
id="fr_822"></span>[1](#fn_822.md) Whether or not we have here the true
origination of the myth which makes the Gospel Jesus the Son of Mariam,
there is a fair presumption from mythological analogy that the Miriam of
the Pentateuch, who dies and is buried at Kadesh, <span
id="fr_823"></span>[2](#fn_823.md) "the holy" city, is a Goddess
Evemerised, <span id="fr_824"></span>[3](#fn_824.md) and that the day of
Joshua's setting out on his fictitious march was in the original myth
the day either of his birth or of some act of popular salvation wrought
by him. If he were originally a variant of Tammuz, and Miriam a variant
of Ishtar, if male infants were circumcised in his honour, and if he
*died* to save men at the Passover, the details to that effect would
certainly be excluded by the later Yahwists from any narrative they
preserved or framed concerning him. As it is, we may at least argue for
a connection between the Judaic "Jesus the Son" and the traditional
"Jesus the Son of the Father."

Beyond conjectures we cannot at present go; but the significance given
to the name of Jeshua, the high-priest of the Return, in the book of
Zechariah, <span id="fr_825"></span>[4](#fn_825.md) at a time when the book
of Joshua did not exist, tells of a Messianic idea so associated when
Messianism was but beginning among the Jews. And as the Messianic idea
seems to have come to them, as it fittingly might, during their exile,
perhaps from the old Babylonian source of the myth of the returning
Hammurabi—who in his own code declares himself the Saviour-Shepherd and
the King of Righteousness <span id="fr_826"></span>[5](#fn_826.md)—or from
the later Mazdean doctrine that the Saviour Saoshyant, the yet unborn
Son of Zarathustra, is at the end of time to raise the dead and destroy
Ahriman, <span id="fr_827"></span>[6](#fn_827.md) it may have had many
divine associations such as later orthodox Judaism would sedulously
obliterate.

What is specially important in this connection is the fact that the
doctrine of a *suffering* Messiah gradually developed among the Jews,
for the most part outside the canonical literature. For the doctrine
that "the Christ must needs have suffered" <span
id="fr_828"></span>[7](#fn_828.md) can be

<span id="page_167">p. 167</span>

scripturally supported only from passages like the fifty-third chapter
of Isaiah, where our A. V. alters the past tense into the present, thus
making a description of Israel's past sufferings serve as a mystic type.
Cyrus, who is called Messiah in Deutero-Isaiah, was reputed to have been
crucified, but not in his Messianic capacity. <span
id="fr_829"></span>[1](#fn_829.md) The presumption then is that the
doctrine was extra-canonical, and was set up by Gentile example. Even in
the Book of Enoch, where the Messianic doctrine is much developed, the
Messiah does not "suffer." The first clear trace of that conception in
Judaic literature appears to be in the doctrine that of the *two*
promised Messiahs, <span id="fr_830"></span>[2](#fn_830.md) Ben Joseph and
Ben David, Ben Joseph is to be slain. <span
id="fr_831"></span>[3](#fn_831.md) Whence came that theorem it is for the
present impossible to say; but it is presumptively foreign, <span
id="fr_832"></span>[4](#fn_832.md) and there are clear Gentile parallels.

An obvious precedent to begin with lay in the Greek myth of the
crucified Prometheus; <span id="fr_833"></span>[5](#fn_833.md) but on the
whole the most likely pagan prototype is to be seen in the slain and
resurgent Dionysos, one of whose chief names is *Eleuthereos*, the
Liberator, <span id="fr_834"></span>[6](#fn_834.md) who was specially
signalised as the God "born again." As the Jewish Messiah was to be
primarily a "deliverer," like the series of legendary national heroes in
the book of Judges, a popular God so entitled was most likely to impress
the imagination of the dispersed Jews and their proselytes. The same
epithet, indeed, may well have attached to ancient deities such as
Samson, who is a variant of the deliverer Herakles, and was one of the
"deliverers" of the pseudo-history, as well as to the original Jesus
whose myth is Evemerised in Joshua. Samson, too, like Dionysos, was
"only-begotten." <span id="fr_835"></span>[7](#fn_835.md) But in any case a
proximate motive is needed to account for the post-exilic or
post-Maccabean revival of such conceptions in a cult form; and it is to
be found in the prevailing religious conceptions of the surrounding
Hellenistic civilisation, where, next to Zeus, the Gods most in evidence
were Dionysos and Herakles, and the Son-sacrificing Kronos. <span
