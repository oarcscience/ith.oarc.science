#### § 14. Possible Historical Elements.

One concrete feature in the crucifixion myth remains to be accounted
for—the scourging. Mr. Lang presses this feature of the Sacæa as an
argument against the view that the victim died as representing a
God. <span id="fr_965"></span>[1](#fn_965.md) In reality, the assumption
that sacrificed victims were never scourged is no better founded than
the assertion that they were never hanged. The human victims in several
Asiatic Greek rites were whipped before being sacrificed. <span
id="fr_966"></span>[2](#fn_966.md) Scourging, besides, actually took the
place of human sacrifice, by tradition, in certain Greek cults; the
scourging (which at times was fatal) being accepted as a sacrificial
act. <span id="fr_967"></span>[3](#fn_967.md) The deity specially connected
with such acts of scourging was Artemis, concerning the Asiatic
savageries of whose cultus we have the disgusted testimony of
Plutarch; <span id="fr_968"></span>[4](#fn_968.md) and it is noteworthy
that the Rhodian victim had been slain near the temple of
Aristobula <span id="fr_969"></span>[5](#fn_969.md)—a name of
Artemis, <span id="fr_970"></span>[6](#fn_970.md) who is thus in late as in
early times connected with human sacrifice. <span
id="fr_971"></span>[7](#fn_971.md) It is therefore not unlikely that, when
the Rhodian rite was modified, scourging was substituted as a means of
obtaining at least the sacrifice of blood; and when the rite reached the
stage of a mystery-drama, that detail would naturally be preserved.

<span id="page_189">p. 189</span>

It is to be remembered, however, that the original principle of such
scourging may be independent of any act of substitution. It is partly
indicated in the Khond doctrine in connection with the rite of slow
burning—that the more tears the victim shed the more abundant would be
the rain. Here indeed there is a plain conflict between two sacrificial
principles, that of the symbolism of the victim's acts and that of his
willingness. But both principles are known to have existed, some of the
Khonds and the Aztecs attaching importance to the tears shed by the
victims, while the Carthaginians sought to drown the cries of their
children, and the mothers were forbidden to weep. <span
id="fr_972"></span>[1](#fn_972.md) In the case of the original human
sacrifice on the Jewish Day of Atonement, as we have seen,' <span
id="fr_973"></span>[2](#fn_973.md) there was a ritual act of weeping, and
perhaps one of scourging; and we have no ground for doubting that
scourging could take place.

But there was a ritual need for blood as well as tears. It is noted that
in the human sacrifices of Polynesia the victims were rarely much
mutilated, but were always made to bleed much; <span
id="fr_974"></span>[3](#fn_974.md) and a perfect obsession of blood
pervades the whole Judaic religion, down to the end of the New
Testament. In the "hanging unto the Lord" of the sons of Saul, indeed,
there was ostensibly no bloodshed; but Joshua is declared to have
"smitten" the five kings before he hanged them. The "sin-offering" too
was one of blood; and a blood sacrifice was the normal one in all
nations. <span id="fr_975"></span>[4](#fn_975.md) Scourging would yield the
blood without making the victim incapable of enduring the hanging or
crucifixion; and in the gospel record that the doomed God sweated as it
were drops of blood <span id="fr_976"></span>[5](#fn_976.md) we may have a
further concession to the idea. Finally, there is the possibility that,
as in the case of the victims in the Asiatic Thargelia and other
festivals, who were ceremonially whipped before being put to death, the
scourging belonged to the conception of the scapegoat, who thus as well
as by banishment bore the people's sins. <span
id="fr_977"></span>[6](#fn_977.md)

In these various ways, then, we can comprehend the gradual evolution of
a ritual with which could be associated on the one hand a belief in a
national deliverer, and on the other hand a general doctrine of
salvation and immortality. The idea of the resurrection of the slain God
is extremely ancient: we have it in the myths of Osiris and of the
descent of Ishtar into Hades to rescue Tammuz;

<span id="page_190">p. 190</span>

and in the Syro-Greek form of the cult, the resurrection of Adonis was a
chief feature of the great annual ritual. So with the other cults
already mentioned. From the God, the concept of resurrection was
extended to the worshippers, this long before the Christian era. It
needed only that the doctrines of divine sacrifice, resurrection, and
salvation, temporal or eternal, should be thus blended in a mystery
ritual with the institution of a eucharist or holy sacrament, to
constitute the foundation of the religion of Jesus the Christ as we have
it in the gospels.

That a mystery-drama actually existed, and was the basis of the gospel
narrative, will be shown in the next section. But in passing it may be
well to note that certain features of the crucifixion myth, though
fairly explicable on the lines above sketched, may be due to
contemporary analogies from other rites or from actual occurrences. The
posture of the victim in the traditional crucifix, which we shall see
some reason for ascribing to a ritual in which the worshipper embraces a
cross, may on the other hand derive from the Perso-Scythian usage of
slaying a "messenger" to the God, flaying him, and stuffing his skin
with the arms outstretched. <span id="fr_978"></span>[1](#fn_978.md) This
sacrifice, indeed, has obvious analogies to that of the "ambassador" in
the old Jewish rite above traced; <span id="fr_979"></span>[2](#fn_979.md)
and in both cases the idea of the cross-form may derive from the fact
that in the gesture-language and picture-writing of savages, which are
probably primeval, that is the recognised attitude and symbol of the
ambassador or "go-between." <span id="fr_980"></span>[3](#fn_980.md) Or the
cross-form may connect with some other principle involved in the Semitic
representation of the Sun-God with arms outstretched, <span
id="fr_981"></span>[4](#fn_981.md) which probably underlies the myth of the
outstretching of the arms of Moses. <span
id="fr_982"></span>[5](#fn_982.md) On the whole, seeing that the Phœnician
symbol of a figure with outstretched arms is found to derive
historically from the Egyptian *crux ansata*, <span
id="fr_983"></span>[6](#fn_983.md) which was certainly an emblem of
salvation, <span id="fr_984"></span>[7](#fn_984.md) we are entitled to
conclude that from time immemorial the posture of the cross had had a
religious significance, partly of expiation, partly of beneficence, and
that this general significance surrounded the Christian myth.

<span id="page_191">p. 191</span>

Yet again, the repetition of the offer of a drink to the victim, or the
mention of gall in that connection, might be motived by the example of
the mysteries of Dêmêtêr, in which there figured a drink of gall. <span
id="fr_985"></span>[1](#fn_985.md) Whatever were the original meaning of
that detail, it might be added to that of a narcotic used as above
explained. It has been elsewhere shown, too, that such a detail as the
crown of thorns might conceivably stand for the nimbus of the Sun-God,
or for the crown placed upon the heads of sacrificial victims in
general, <span id="fr_986"></span>[2](#fn_986.md) or for the crown which
was worn by human victims in such a sacrificial procession as is to be
inferred from Herodotus’ story of Herakles in Egypt, or for the actual
crowns of thorns which were in vogue for religious purposes in the
district of Abydos, or for some other ritual practice which is sought to
be explained by the myth of the mock-crown of Herakles <span
id="fr_987"></span>[3](#fn_987.md) No limit can well be set to the
possibility of such analogies from pagan religious practice.

Actual or alleged history, too, may have given rise to some details in a
mystery-ritual such as we are considering. In the gospel story as it now
stands, though not as an original and dramatic detail in it, we find one
remarkable coincidence with a passage in Josephus. The historian
tells <span id="fr_988"></span>[4](#fn_988.md) that during the Passover
feast, while Jerusalem was being besieged, "the eastern gate of the
inner sanctuary, which was of brass and very solid, which in the evening
was with difficulty shut by twenty men, and which was supported by
iron-bound bars and posts reaching far down, let into the floor of solid
stone, was seen about the sixth hour of the night to have

<span id="page_192">p. 192</span>

opened of its own accord"; and that this was felt by the wise to be an
omen of ruin. In the synoptics it is told that after the robbers taunted
Jesus, "from the sixth hour darkness was over the land till the ninth
hour," whereupon Jesus uttered his cry of Eli, Eli, and immediately
afterwards, "having again cried with a loud voice, gave up his spirit.
And lo, the veil of the temple was rent in two from top to bottom." The
three hours of darkness, it would appear, are alleged in order to give
time for the passover meal, by way of assimilating the synoptic account
to the Johannine. In the second gospel—in an apparently interpolated
passage—Jesus is crucified at "the third hour": in the fourth, "it was
Preparation of the Passover: it was about the sixth hour" when Jesus is
*sent* to be crucified; and on that view his death would be consummated
when the Passover sacrament was—the gospel, however, giving no further
details. The space of silent suffering in the synoptics, from the sixth
hour to the ninth, makes the stories finally correspond as to the hours,
though not as to the day. In the third gospel, however, the reading is
confused by the placing of the sentence: "And the sun was darkened, and
the veil of the temple was rent in the midst," *after* the mention of
the three hours’ darkness and *before* the Lord's death. Thus, while the
actual time of the veil-rending is loft in the vague, the passage can be
read as saying that the veil was rent when the darkness began, at the
sixth hour.

In any case, whether or not the darkness of three hours is a late
modification of the synoptic text (on which view the *death* may be held
to have been originally placed at the sixth hour, and the rending of the
temple veil at the same moment), the story in Josephus is extremely
likely to have been the motive of the veil-rending myth in the gospels.
It actually did lead to the insertion of a gloss in an early
text—perhaps originally Syriac—of the third gospel, where the stone
placed at the mouth of the Lord's tomb is alleged to be such that twenty
men could hardly roll it away; and in the existing old Syriac texts,
significantly enough, it is the "front of the *gate*" of the sanctuary
or temple that is rent in the gospel story—not the veil. <span
id="fr_989"></span>[1](#fn_989.md) And the parallel does not end here. The
story of the rising of the saints, so awkwardly interpolated in the
first gospel and in that only, is no less clearly an adaptation of the
story of Josephus, in the same passage, to the effect that at the feast
of Pentecost the priests when serving by night in the inner temple felt
a quaking,

<span id="page_193">p. 193</span>

and heard a great noise, and then a sound as of a multitude saying: "Let
us remove hence." The whole series of portents in Josephus, as it
happens, winds up with the story of Jesus the son of Ananus, who had so
long "with a loud voice" cried "Woe to Jerusalem," and at last was slain
by a stone from an engine, crying "Woe to myself also" as he gave up the
ghost.

In view of such a remarkable suggestion to the early Jesuists, it seems
unnecessary even to ask whether the myth of the veil-rending may be a
variant popularly current at the same time with those given by Josephus.
In all likelihood the interpolators of the Greek gospel modified both
episodes in order either to escape contradiction or to make them more
suitable symbolically. <span id="fr_990"></span>[1](#fn_990.md) That they
were interpolated after the transcription of the mystery-play we shall
see when we consider that as such; but for the present we have to
recognise that if the transcribed narrative could be thus influenced,
the play itself might be.

The scourging and crucifixion of Antigonus, again, must have made a
profound impression on the Jews; <span id="fr_991"></span>[2](#fn_991.md)
and it is a historic fact that the similar slaying of the last of the
Incas was kept in memory for the Peruvians by a drama annually
acted. <span id="fr_992"></span>[3](#fn_992.md) It may be that the
superscription "This is the King of the Jews," and even the detail of
scourging, <span id="fr_993"></span>[4](#fn_993.md) came proximately from
the story of Antigonus; though on the other hand it is not unlikely that
Antony should have executed Antigonus on the lines of the sacrifice of
the mock-king. But it is noteworthy that where the existing
mystery-drama, which was doubtless a Gentile development from a much
simpler form, introduces historical characters, it does so on the clear
lines of sacrificial principle set forth in the ritual of the Khonds,
where already the symbol of the cross is prominent in the fashion of
slaying the victim. Though the Gentile hostility to the Jews <span
id="fr_994"></span>[5](#fn_994.md) would dictate the special implication of
the Jewish priests and people, and of King Herod as in the third gospel,
the total effect is to make it clear that the guilt of the sacrifice
rests on no one official, but is finally taken by the whole people upon
them. Even the quotation put in the mouth of the dying God-Man, "My God,
My God, why hast thou forsaken me?" <span
id="fr_995"></span>[6](#fn_995.md) has the effect of implying that he had
hitherto suffered voluntarily. Thus does the ritual which was to grow
into a world religion preserve in its consummated quasi-historical form
the primeval

<span id="page_194">p. 194</span>

principle that "one man should die for the people" by the people's will;
and, as we have seen, not even in extending the benefit of the sacrifice
to "all mankind" does the great historic religion outgo the religious
psychology of the ancient Dravidians.

When this is realised it will be seen to be unnecessary to suppose that
any abnormal personality had arisen to give the cult its form or
impetus. In view, however, of the story fortuitously preserved in the
Talmud, that one Jesus ben Pandira was stoned and hanged on a tree at
Lydda on the eve of the Passover in the reign of Alexander Jannæus about
100 B.C., <span id="fr_996"></span>[1](#fn_996.md) we are not entitled to
say that a real act of sacerdotal vengeance did not enter into the
making of the movement. The evidence is obscure; and the personality of
the hanged Jesus, who is said to have been a sorcerer and a false
teacher, becomes elusive and quasi-mythical even in the Talmud; but even
such evidence gives better ground for a historical assumption than the
supernaturalist narrative of the gospels. <span
id="fr_997"></span>[2](#fn_997.md) In any case, there is no reason to
ascribe any special doctrinal teaching whatever to Jesus ben Pandira. He
remains but a name, with a mention of his death by "hanging on a tree,"
a quasi-sacrifice, at the time of the sacrificial rite which had
anciently been one of man-slaying and child-slaying. Leaving the case on
that side undetermined, we turn to a problem which admits of solution.

*Egypt. Rel.* pp. 42, 44, *note*.

<span id="fn_985"></span>[191:1](pch41.htm#fr_985.md) Such symbolical
explanations may in certain cases be substituted for those offered by
Dr. Frazer, whose Virgilian "golden bough," to start with, is shown by
Mr. Lang to be very imperfectly identified with the bough of the tree in
the Arician grove. Mr. Lang, who is apt to be severe on loose
conjectures, for his own part "hazards a guess" that "of old, suppliants
approached gods or kings with boughs in their hands," and that the
Virgilian bough is such a propitiation to Persephonê (*Magic and
Religion*, pp. 207-8). Though the "gold" might plausibly be thus
explained, it does not follow that the wool-wreathed boughs of suppliant
groups, which played the part of our white flags (Æschylus, *Supplices*,
22-3, 190-2, etc.), were normally used in approaching kings, or all
Gods. In Polynesia boughs were indeed presented to certain Gods (Ellis,
i, 343), and were *carried before* chiefs, serving also as peace symbols
or "white flags" (Turner, *Nineteen Years in Polynesia*, 1861, p. 314).
But, on the other hand, boughs in the ancient world had a special
connection with Gods and Goddesses of vegetation (Cp. Grant Allen,
*Evol. of Idea of God*, p. 384), who were first and last Gods of the
Underworld (Cp. Æsch. *Supplices*, 154-161). It was doubtless in this
connection that a branch became in Egypt a symbol of time and of
eternity (Tiele, *Eg. Rel.*, p. 154). The explanation of the Virgilian
bough, then, probably lies in that direction. It is not known." says Mr.
Lang, "whether Virgil invented his bough, or took it from his rich store
of antiquarian learning" (*Id*. p. 207). It is extremely unlikely that
he should have invented it. But he might very well know that in one of
the paintings of Polygnotus at Delphi (Pausanias, x, 30) Orpheus is
represented as touching with his hand a branch of the willow-tree, which
in Homer (*Odyssey*, x, 509-510) grows with the poplar in the grove of
Persephonê. Orpheus had been in Hades and returned. May not the bough
then have had this general symbolical significance, and hence figure as
a passport to the underworld?

<span id="fn_986"></span>[191:2](pch41.htm#fr_986.md) Even the Cimbri,
whose priestesses cut the throats of their devoted human victims,
crowned them beforehand (Strabo, vii, 2, § 3). Similarly the North
American Indians. Lafitau, ii, 266.

(*First Three Gospels*, 3rd ed. p. 312) indignantly cites this
proposition with the remark that it erects one passage of the Talmud
"into an authority before which the gospels must vanish." Such language
hides the issue. *Historically*, the supernaturalist narrative of the
gospels has no authority for critical science. Professor Schmiedel
reduces their scientific authority to nine texts, which, however, will
not meet the tests he admits to be applicable. See App. to *Christianity
and Mythology*, 2nd ed. Dr. Carpenter appears to wish to suggest that I
take any Talmudic story as a *disproof* of any analogous story in the
gospels—a complete misrepresentation. The gospel stories are
historically unacceptable apart from any Talmudic evidence.
