#### § 9.

The clear solution, as distinguished from the rebuttal, of all such
contradictions is to recognise that, however we may grade religious
conceptions and systems, they are all parts of one process, even as are
political conceptions and systems. To say that magic is hostile to
religion is like saying that either republicanism or monarchism is
hostile to politics. For primitive man there are no conceptual divisions
between religion and science, worship and art; and the distinction
between art-magic and sympathetic-magic—made after the express
declaration that mere sympathetic magic was "the germ of all magic"—is
an arbitrary stroke of pro-Christian classification, which, nonetheless,
logically defeats its purpose. For the primitive sacramental meal was
demonstrably on the plane of sympathetic magic inasmuch as, even when it
did not kill the victim in a mimetic fashion, it was a making-friends
with the God in the way of human

<span id="page_29">p. 29</span>

fraternisation; and it is to this sacrament that Dr. Jevons, for obvious
reasons, accords the special religious rank. It is worse than idle to
seek to keep it on a plane apart by framing a formula of "direct
consciousness" on the part of the worshippers that they were descended
from an animal progenitor on the score that they felt filially towards
him. The professed magic-monger's consciousness was rather more direct
than theirs. But the definitions themselves give up the case. "Applied
science" is just "art," and "art-magic" is thus just a form of what Dr.
Jevons calls sympathetic-magic. Moreover, the ritual of supplication and
gratitude, which he declares to be strictly religious, is visibly framed
in the same spirit of expectation of profit as is seen in the magic
ritual. A study of the human-sacrifice ritual of the Khonds, cited
hereinafter, will make clear both the congruity and the conjunction.

It is certainly true that the one ritual becomes hostile to the other
when magic is practised by the sorcerer as an outsider, secretly
competing with or undermining the priest. <span
id="fr_111"></span>[1](#fn_111.md) But in that sense any one religious
system is hostile to any other in the same field; and in the same sense
heresy is hostile to orthodoxy, and dissent to the official cult,
without ceasing to be a form of religion. Such a distinction is on all
fours with that between "religion" and "superstition," disposed of by
Hobbes as a mere marking off of the "allowed" belief from that not
allowed." If the alleged "hostility" between religion and magic is
reducible to a mere distinction between quasi-communal and
individualistic sorcery, the whole dispute passes from the plane of
psychological theory to that of simple sociological classification. We
pass from a debate over a fallacy to a debate over a mere plea for a
particular terminology. <span id="fr_112"></span>[2](#fn_112.md) But now
there arises a fresh fallacy of ethical discrimination. The communal
sorcery, called religion, is falsely certificated as moral and
humanitarian. It is no more so than the other. In Africa the private or
amateur sorcerer (usually a victim of the professional witch-doctor") is
regarded as the enemy of mankind; but it is precisely by the public
magician—witch-doctor, rain-doctor, sorcerer—that the alleged amateur is
nefariously "smelt out" and given up to slaughter. <span
id="fr_113"></span>[3](#fn_113.md) If it be argued that "religious" magic
aims at the public good and "mere" magic at private harm, the answer is
that the public magician is often notoriously a murdering scoundrel, and
the alleged private sorcerer an innocent man done to death.

<span id="page_30">p. 30</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> And that is not
all. On the separatist theory, the legend of Elijah's calling down fire
from heaven makes him an irreligious magician, in that he was not only
acting irregularly and unofficially, but going through the procedure of
a sorcerer with absolute confidence in his power to control the will of
his God. His machinery of supererogatory watering of his
sacrifice—which, as regards the coming rain, was sympathetic magic—was
"religiously" gratuitous presumption; and he was staking the whole
fortunes of his cult on the chance that his prayer would be miraculously
answered. He was, in fact, coercing his God by making the God's credit
with his people depend upon the God's obedience to his wishes. <span
id="fr_114"></span>[1](#fn_114.md) It will not avail to acquit Elijah on
the score of faith when the faith of the magician in *his* means of
controlling the Gods is made precisely his offence. Among native tribes
of the Victoria Nyanza region, "the people, in fact, hold that rulers
*must* have power over Nature and her phenomena." <span
id="fr_115"></span>[2](#fn_115.md) Here the "anti-theistic" magic is the
main element in the communal religion; and once more the separatist
theory breaks down.

That priests in many ages and stages of culture have been hostile to
magic is true just in the sense in which it is true that—with deeper
cause—they have been hostile to science. In the early and "dark" ages of
Christendom the priests of the Christian Church, primed by a
magical-medical doctrine of the curing of sickness by the laying on of
hands, denounced as atheistic the view of disease passed on by pagan
science. <span id="fr_116"></span>[3](#fn_116.md) Those priests were all
the while practisers of exorcisms, <span id="fr_117"></span>[4](#fn_117.md)
and were none the less, for Dr. Jevons, highly religious. In the same
way the intensely religious Ainu of Saghalien, who practise magic for
the cure of disease and resort to professional wizards for the same
purpose, <span id="fr_118"></span>[5](#fn_118.md) resent as irreligious the
attempt to promote the earth's fertility by manure. When Mr. Batchelor,
the missionary, proposed to dig and manure his garden, and explained his
wish to his Ainu gardener, that religious personage, strong in his inner
consciousness, thus rebuked him: "What, will you, a clergyman and
preacher of religion, so dishonour and insult the Gods? Will not the
Gods give due increase without your *attempting to force their hand* or
endeavouring to drive Nature?" <span id="fr_119"></span>[6](#fn_119.md)

<span id="page_31">p. 31</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Here we have the
very doctrine of Dr. Jevons and Dr. Frazer: the manuring missionary was
an "arrogant" magician, seeking to control the unseen powers in a way
which was not the Ainu way. (That, it appears, was usually
expectoration.) "Considerably surprised," says Mr. Batchelor, "I looked
at him to see if he were joking. But he was quite serious." Poor Mr.
Batchelor was being treated as his cloth had treated the doctors in the
days of unflawed faith. Happily the Ainu did not possess an Inquisition.

True it may be, again, that magic is at some points a lowering of the
religious sentiment; though much of the quasi-scientific reflection on
this head appears to be a mere echo of ecclesiastical declamation. If we
were seriously to inquire which has done the more harm in the way of
hindering civilisation, strangling science, obscuring the facts of
Nature, and prompting human cruelty, it would soon be found that the
organised cults which curse the magician have been by far the more
pernicious. <span id="fr_120"></span>[1](#fn_120.md) The barbarisation
wrought by the attempts of the courageously "superstitious" few to
practise witchcraft is trifling beside that compassed by the no less
superstitious many in putting supposed witches to death. This holds good
of the general life of Africa through whole millenniums, in which
countless millions of human beings have been slain as sorcerers and
witches on the accusation of professional witch-doctors; and again of
the inferrible life of the Hebrews and the recorded witchcraft-manias of
Christendom. And if this side of the problem be waived, the fact remains
that the Christian religion, which Dr. Jevons and the rest rank as the
highest and purest of religious systems, historically took its rise in
the "reversion" from theistic faith to a form of sympathetic magic, the
eucharist, and was practically rooted as a State cult throughout Europe
by the assumption of magical functions on the part of the priest, not
only in the administration of the eucharist itself, but in the claim to
exercise "supernatural" powers of exorcism and to wield "supernatural"
instruments in the form of holy relics. Such practices certainly
represent an intellectual and moral declension from the ethic of all the
leading Greek schools and of the nobler rabbins.

In other cases a differentiation between magician and priest may have
been in origin economic and political, apart from any ethical motive.
Among the Bataks of Sumatra, while ancestors are imaged, and the images,
as being made potent by soul-stuff, have

<span id="page_32">p. 32</span>

places in the temples where ancestors are worshipped, the higher Gods
are without images or temples, and are prayed to only in conjunction
with ancestors or spirits; and here it is noted that the magician "has
nothing to do with the worship of the Gods, but operates on the
relations with spirits and souls," while the priest attends to the
matters relating to the higher Gods. <span
id="fr_121"></span>[1](#fn_121.md) The explanation appears to lie in the
fact that, as among the Romans, every Batak house-father is priest as
regards ancestors, souls, and spirits. The priest-managed cult is either
the survival of one imposed on the populace by conquerors and specially
provided for (as probably was the case in Rome), or a result of priestly
enterprise in imitation of foreign systems. <span
id="fr_122"></span>[2](#fn_122.md) Its ethical content is a matter of other
chances.

Granted, yet again, that dissenting magic, whether beneficent or
maleficent in intention, is logically inconsistent with the conceptions
of deity normally professed by the magic-monger himself, it is here on
all fours with the total structure of the official creed, whichsoever it
be. The conception of sacrifice in all its forms is morally
irreconcilable with the doctrine of divine justice and goodness, and was
on that very ground repudiated by the greater Hebrew and pagan
moralists; and with the doctrine of salvation by sacrifice falls the
doctrine of salvation by faith. Press that one ethical principle, and
the whole apparatus of official Christian ethic collapses, even as the
apparatus of prayer and providentialism falls by the test of the
principles of divine omniscience, beneficence, and foreordination. Dr.
Jevons’s principle of exclusion, in fact, finally makes *tabula rasa* of
the whole field of religious institutions and religious life, and leaves
us recognising only a factor which he has expressly excluded from his
definition of the religious consciousness—to wit, philosophy.

Here, again, the theoretic separation is spurious. In terms of many
parts of Dr. Jevons’s exposition, early religion is just the effort to
unify the cosmos through a conception of deity; and early philosophy was
nothing else. To stamp as religious only those forms of thought in which
the believer has "direct consciousness" of "the divine," excluding every
process of meditation and inference as such, is to include in religion
the phenomena of hallucination and even of insanity (to say nothing of
the liberal expansion of the

<span id="page_33">p. 33</span>

formula to include men's belief in their personal descent from an
animal), and to bar out as non-religious the theism which stands on the
thesis that "this scheme of things cannot be without a mind."

On the other hand, ordinary animism, which Dr. Jevons rules out, is
certainly a belief in terms of almost though not quite unreflecting
consciousness; and to proceed to disqualify it on the ground that it is
a projection of man's personality into Nature is to evoke a fatal
challenge; for if this is to be said of animism, it will certainly have
to be said much more emphatically of theism. The "impression of the
divine personality" of which Dr. Jevons speaks is precisely the
projection of the subject's personality into the unknown, and this by
Dr. Jevons’s own showing. To judge from his later argument, while he at
times professes to waive the question of the veracity of the religious
consciousness, he is much disposed to let it be its own
verification. <span id="fr_123"></span>[1](#fn_123.md) This, however, he
can scarcely venture-on in the case of the primitive man's belief that
he descended from a fox, a bear, or a serpent. It is one thing to
pronounce such a belief "truly religious," by way of securing in advance
the "true" heredity of the Christian eucharist; it is another to put
such a "fact of consciousness" beside the Christian consciousness of
direct divine intercourse and inner answer to prayer. On the latter step
must follow the admission that the so-called religious form of
"consciousness" is by far the more self-projecting, the less truly
receptive, of the two, save indeed where it is merely the mouthpiece of
the other. Otherwise Dr. Jevons’s undertaking ends in the edifying
decree that the company of the truly religious includes every mahdi,
every fakir, every sibyl, every savage seer, every spiritualist, every
epileptic Salvationist, every Corybantic worshipper of Cybelê or Kali,
and repels not only a Thomas Aquinas, a Pascal, a Hegel, a Spinoza, a
Martineau, but every similar thinker who in antiquity prepared the very
doctrines which the "feelers" demonstrably took as the theme of their
alleged consciousness. <span id="fr_124"></span>[2](#fn_124.md)

It can hardly be that in thus shaping his definition Dr. Jevons aimed at
demonstrating subtly the sub-rationality of religion. He has, indeed, by
his theorem of "direct consciousness," brought religion to precisely the
position he assigned to taboo—that of an "irrational" and "arbitrary"
association of ideas. He accepted

<span id="page_34">p. 34</span>

from Mr. Lang, as we saw, the verdict that taboo is thus irrational
because its principle is "that causal connection in thought is
equivalent to causative connection in fact." Yet this is exactly the
principle which he vindicates on behalf of the religious consciousness.
*Its* notion of causal connection is to be in very truth equivalent to
causative connection in fact. It is not to reason; it is not to seek
evidence or submit to tests; it is to bring all experience in submission
to itself. And it is not only the belief in a Good Male God that is thus
assured of its superiority in virtue of its arbitrariness; it is every
hallucination of every savage, every vision of the Virgin by a
neurasthenic Catholic, every epiphany of Isis or Aphrodite or Cotytto in
the past—nay more, every dream of a devil! It seems a sinister service
to latter-day religion thus to demonstrate that it is on all fours not
with purified philosophy, but with the most unintelligible forms of
taboo and the darkest forms of "superstition."

Once more, however, the scientific course consists not in taking
advantage of the logical suicide of those who conduct the other, but in
setting forth the fundamental analogy of the psychological processes
thus arbitrarily differentiated. The "direct consciousness" of the
theist—sheer hallucination apart—is simply a reversion to the earlier
man's confidence in his animistic conceptions, doubled with the
conscious resistance to sceptical criticism seen in every
dream-interpreter and ghost-seer of the country-side. The persistence is
simply a matter of temperament and degree of enlightenment: there are
men who can transcend this like other testimonies of their direct
consciousness, in learning to see it as a kind of hallucination which
may be predicted to arise in some cases in regard to any theistic
conception which any thinker may contrive to set up. Where there are
images of the Virgin, men and women will have visions of the Virgin;
where there are images of animal-Gods, there will be visions of
animal-Gods.

Between "impressions" and "projections" there is no such psychological
gulf as Dr. Jevons assumes. If there were, the *political* influence on
doctrine which he classes as non-religious would still be in terms of
his other theorem truly religious, for the act of thinking of rule in
heaven in terms of rule on earth is a sufficiently docile surrender to
an impression on consciousness, and would be made by multitudes with the
possible minimum of reflection. But, in truth, a minimum of reflection
there needs must be in every process of belief; and what Dr. Jevons at
times describes as pure processes of direct consciousness are
demonstrably not so, or are so

<span id="page_35">p. 35</span>

only in the sense in which the same thing may be predicated of the
thinking of the primitive magician. The man who says he is conscious of
an inward answer to prayer is not conscious of it as he is of the sound
of a voice; what he experiences is a sense of satisfaction, which
(albeit only the result of a release of nervous tension) he *infers* to
come as a direct communication from deity; <span
id="fr_125"></span>[1](#fn_125.md) and such inference is merely a more
casual and less meditated process of reasoning than those which Dr.
Jevons dismisses as non-religious. It is thus less rational as being
less "reasonable"; but it is not "irrational" save in the loose sense of
"fallacious." It is more arbitrary, but only in the sense that it is
less mindful of reason and more egotistic, more self-willed, than the
process which appeals fraternally to other men's judgments. Arbitrary in
Dr. Jevons’s implied sense of having *no* basis it cannot be: so to
define the term is to reduce it to insignificance. However vicious
religious reasoning may be, it remains reasoning.

reasoning à priori, but from a knowledge of concrete cases. It is to be
wished that a scientific study should be made of the processes of
religious consciousness, familiar and other. But even without that, the
crudity of Dr. Jevons’s psychological apparatus is sufficiently evident.
