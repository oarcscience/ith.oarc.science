#### § 5. The Divinity of the Victim.

On the classic side there is thus abundant evidence as to the practice
of human sacrifice, and some as to sacramental cannibalism, in the
historic period; but what the theory finally requires is either the
sacrifice of a victim who, as being specifically divine, is the subject
of a eucharist, or the proof that such a eucharist could be combined
with the sacrifice of a divine victim. Now, in the Khond cult, as we
have seen, not only is the victim deified, but the propitiated Goddess
figures in the myth as the original sacrifice. An ostensibly similar
myth is found in ancient Babylon, in a creation story, where Marduk is
actually decapitated in order that the first man may be made from his
blood and "bone." <span id="fr_583"></span>[3](#fn_583.md) After such
precedents, the deification of sacrificed victims could readily follow;
though the probability is, of course, that the myth was framed to
explain an already established usage of deification. Of this conception
we have already seen a clear trace in the old Mediterranean world in the
sacrifices of the Albanians to the Moon-Goddess; and for fuller light we
turn first to the cult of Dionysos. Not only is there the story of the
substitution of a goat for a boy in the sacrifice to Dionysos at
Potniæ, <span id="fr_584"></span>[4](#fn_584.md) but there is the combined
significance of (*a*) the myth of the rending of the divine boy
Dionysos, in the form of a bull, by the Titans; <span
id="fr_585"></span>[5](#fn_585) (*b*.md) the fact that in the ritual
mystery the worshippers tore a live bull to pieces with their
teeth; <span id="fr_586"></span>[6](#fn_586) (*c*.md) the peculiar
Dionysiak ritual at Tenedos, where a gravid cow was treated as a woman
in labour, and her calf, devoted to the God, was made to wear the tragic
*cothurni*, while the slayer was formally pursued with stones and had to
fly into the sea; <span id="fr_587"></span>[7](#fn_587) (*d*.md) the actual
rending of men as Dionysiak sacrifices at Chios and Tenedos; <span
id="fr_588"></span>[8](#fn_588) and (*e*.md) the peculiar procedure in the
Athenian *Bouphonia* or religious "murder

<span id="page_131">p. 131</span>

of the ox," <span id="fr_589"></span>[1](#fn_589.md) where the ceremonial
flight of the slayers, their repudiation of guilt, and the solemn trial
and condemnation of the weapons used as being the guilty things, all go
to show that the ox represented either a divinity or a human victim, or
the former by development from the latter. <span
id="fr_590"></span>[2](#fn_590.md) The theory of Robertson Smith, that the
animal sacrifice is the earlier, need not be here considered. It rests
on the assumption that the primordial communion-sacrifice was
totemistic; and this has not been and cannot be proved. On the other
hand we have many traces of the substitution of an animal for a human
sacrifice in historic times; and this is all that is required to solve
the historic problem.

From another side we see the same principle at work in the old Theban
sacrifice to Amun, <span id="fr_591"></span>[3](#fn_591.md) wherein the
ram, the symbolic and sacred animal of the God, never otherwise
sacrificed, was on the annual festival-day of the God offered up to him,
the skin being placed on the God's statue. As Herodotus tells the story,
there was then brought beside the image of Amun an image of "Herakles,"
presumably Khonsu, the Son of the God in the Theban Trinity; <span
id="fr_592"></span>[4](#fn_592.md) whereafter "all who are in the temple
beat themselves in mourning for the ram, and then bury him in a holy
sepulchre." Whatever may have been the parts played by father and son
respectively in this rite, it is clear that the slaying of the
ram—presumptively a lamb—represented the death of the God, whose
resurrection would necessarily follow, like that of Osiris. In the
ritual worship of Herakles, the man burned alive represented the
God, <span id="fr_593"></span>[5](#fn_593.md) who in the myth dies on the
funeral pyre. Another rite practised in the worship of the Syrian
Goddess indicates in a different way the original connection of an
animal sacrifice with a human sacrifice and a sacrament. In the Syrian
ritual, the stranger who came to sacrifice had to offer up a sheep, of
which he partook, on whose skin he knelt, and whose head he placed on
his in the act of supplication. <span id="fr_594"></span>[6](#fn_594.md)
The symbolism is here fairly complete. And in yet another rite, that of
the sacrifice and sacramental eating of a camel among the Sinaitic Arabs
of the fourth century, <span id="fr_595"></span>[7](#fn_595.md) it was
clearly avowed that the young white camel was a

<span id="page_132">p. 132</span>

substitute for a human sacrifice, young and beautiful captives being the
preferred victims. In this case the blood of the wounded camel was drunk
by the tribesmen, and the animal was cut to pieces and instantly
devoured raw. That at a remote period the human victim was so eaten, it
is difficult to doubt. <span id="fr_596"></span>[1](#fn_596.md)

Proceeding on the maxim that the myth is always long posterior to the
rite which it pretends to explain, we must suppose that before the
composition of the legends concerning the Titans and the birth, death,
and rebirth of Dionysos, such a primitive rite as the legend describes
had actually been performed. Between a ritual in which the victim is
torn to pieces for burial in the fields, and one in which the victim is
eaten by the worshippers, there is a process of development to be
accounted for. Two hypotheses are open. The Khond rite may be a
modification of an original ritual of cannibalism; or the ancient
Dionysiak rite may stand for a transformation of the typical rite, in
which, an animal having been substituted for a human victim, the eating
of it became a means to communion with the God whom the animal
mystically represented. Broadly speaking, one process is as likely as
the other; and both have evidently taken place. While the Khonds did not
eat their human sacrifice, the Gonds, a kindred Dravidian race, by one
account actually did; <span id="fr_597"></span>[2](#fn_597.md) and many
medieval and modern instances of kin-eating and other ritual cannibalism
are on record. <span id="fr_598"></span>[3](#fn_598.md) In one of the most
recently noted instances of human sacrifice among contemporary savages,
which is also the most primitive that has been observed—the cult of the
Snake-God at Ebritum in Southern Nigeria—the annual victims seem to have
been eaten regularly; and of the four hundred slain on the occasion of
the death of a great chief, "all were killed at Ebritum as offerings to
the God, and then eaten by the Aro people, the flesh being distributed
through the late chief's country. These victims were looked upon as
sacred, and those who ate their flesh ate Gods, and thus assimilated
within themselves something of the divine attributes and power. The
victims were not fattened before being killed." <span
id="fr_599"></span>[4](#fn_599.md) In another tribe, the Ibo, the sacrifice
and eating of a male or female slave is still a regular part of the
"Okuku" or post-funeral ceremony for a chief; and in this case the
victim is "bought with a price" after the chief's death, fattened, and
treated

<span id="page_133">p. 133</span>

with particular kindness, in the Asiatic fashion. <span
id="fr_600"></span>[1](#fn_600.md) Instances of ritual cannibalism may
easily be multiplied. In the annual human holocaust at Whydah, a century
ago, the sacrifice of one man thrown from a height with his hands tied,
a muzzled crocodile, and a pair of pigeons with clipped wings,
terminated the celebration; and the man in this case was devoured by the
multitude. <span id="fr_601"></span>[2](#fn_601.md) And to this day, in the
words of one observer, "no great human sacrifice offered for the purpose
of appeasing the Gods and averting sickness or misfortune is considered
to be complete unless either the priests or the people eat the bodies of
the victims." <span id="fr_602"></span>[3](#fn_602.md) The same sacramental
element is seen in the eating of parts of the sacrificed captives of war
at Bonny. <span id="fr_603"></span>[4](#fn_603.md)

In the Tonga Islands, again, the bodies of enemies slain in war were
dedicated to the Gods, and a few sacramentally eaten: this at a stage of
civilisation at which many of the community, and particularly the women,
regarded the proceeding with disgust; <span
id="fr_604"></span>[5](#fn_604.md) and similar survivals were noted in the
Marquesas. <span id="fr_605"></span>[6](#fn_605.md) In Fiji <span
id="fr_606"></span>[7](#fn_606.md) and Tahiti <span
id="fr_607"></span>[8](#fn_607.md) dedication to the Gods was a preliminary
to every act of public cannibalism. Among the Niam-Niams of Nubia, too,
it appears to have been chiefly in times of war that cannibalism was
resorted to; and though a white onlooker ascribed the act in such a case
to sheer "blood-thirstiness and hatred," <span
id="fr_608"></span>[9](#fn_608.md) it was doubtless a religious proceeding.
The same inference arises in the cases in which Native Americans in
modern times have been known to eat human flesh in time of war; since
they did it "with repugnance," though they believed it to produce
courage. <span id="fr_609"></span>[10](#fn_609.md) Even the infliction of
torture may have a religious as distinct from a merely revengeful
motive, <span id="fr_610"></span>[11](#fn_610.md) as in a sacrifice among
the Native Americans in which the victim, a slave, was burned by a slow
fire, with progressive mutilation and partial eating, followed by
killing and the eating of the remains. Finally the partakers beat on
their huts "to compel the soul of the defunct to abandon the
village." <span id="fr_611"></span>[12](#fn_611.md) Here we have a
systematic ritual. <span id="fr_612"></span>[13](#fn_612.md)

<span id="page_134">p. 134</span>

We may therefore conclude that primordially the human sacrifice was
normally eaten, as it was by the semi-civilised Mexicans at the time of
the Spanish conquest. It is in fact certain that anthropophagy has been
practised in all parts of the world in the savage and semi-civilised
stages; <span id="fr_613"></span>[1](#fn_613.md) and it is no less certain
that cannibalism had persisted long in its religious form after it had
ceased to be a normal practice: the rationale of the act being, not that
men to the last offered the Gods that which they commonly liked for
themselves, but that they held it a sacred experience to continue to eat
what they believed the God to eat. <span id="fr_614"></span>[2](#fn_614.md)
On the other hand, the recoil from cannibalism which everywhere marks
the rise of humanity would, in the more civilised Asiatic states, lead
on one hand to the setting apart of criminals for the human sacrifices,
and on the other to the substitution of an animal, which, partly in
virtue of survivals of totemism and partly in virtue of the current
conception of all sacrifice, <span id="fr_615"></span>[3](#fn_615.md) could
pass as the representative and incarnation of the God, and would at the
same time serve for the typical sacramental meal, but no longer in a
totemistic sense. <span id="fr_616"></span>[4](#fn_616.md)

A certain difficulty arises as to the use of criminals for sacrificial
purposes. As we have seen, the Khonds vetoed it, and rejected

<span id="page_135">p. 135</span>

even prisoners of war. In view of the nearly universal principle <span
id="fr_617"></span>[1](#fn_617.md) among the higher races of antiquity that
the sacrifice must be pure and without blemish, a criminal would seem to
be the last man to suit the part; and among the Mesopotamian Semites a
genuine and precious sacrament was anciently insisted on. <span
id="fr_618"></span>[2](#fn_618.md) This appears to have been the idea
underlying the common rule that the victim should be a male, which
prevailed among the peoples of Nigeria in recent times as regards both
men and animals. <span id="fr_619"></span>[3](#fn_619.md) Yet these tribes,
as we have seen, sacrifice indifferently a female or a male slave
to-day; <span id="fr_620"></span>[4](#fn_620.md) and of the practice at
Benin it is told that "the people who were kept for sacrifice were bad
men or men with bad sickness—they were all slaves"; and that a slave who
committed a murder was put apart as a fit victim for the common
good. <span id="fr_621"></span>[5](#fn_621.md) A woman again, was the usual
sacrifice to the Rain-God; <span id="fr_622"></span>[6](#fn_622.md) and
women slaves were among those sacrificed to save the city. <span
id="fr_623"></span>[7](#fn_623.md) So among the Egyptians, even in our era,
there was a usage of sacrificing a virgin annually to the Nile. <span
id="fr_624"></span>[8](#fn_624.md) The idea of fitness, in short, could
easily and spontaneously vary. <span id="fr_625"></span>[9](#fn_625.md) So,
among the Greeks, virgins are typical victims for human sacrifice; and
the Goddess known simply as Parthenos, sometimes associated with Athênê,
and by Herodotus identified with Iphigeneia, <span
id="fr_626"></span>[10](#fn_626.md) is probably but an abstraction from a
once annual virgin-sacrifice. But it is found that in primitive
communities the act of execution "constantly assumes sacrificial
forms"; <span id="fr_627"></span>[11](#fn_627.md) and it is told of the
Bataks of Sumatra that they ate their executed criminals, without any
other resort to cannibalism, the relatives of the executed man being
entitled to the best pieces, <span id="fr_628"></span>[12](#fn_628.md) The
same is told of the people of Francis Island in the South Pacific:
"Thieves were killed and their bodies eaten: only in such cases was
there cannibalism." <span id="fr_629"></span>[13](#fn_629.md) In the case
of the Bataks at least

<span id="page_136">p. 136</span>

there would seem to be a clear survival of an anthropophagous sacrament,
as it can hardly he supposed that people not otherwise cannibalistic
would desire to devour an executed relative for the sheer pleasure of
eating human flesh. And the accepted explanation of Batak practice is
one which chimes with all we know of the motives to theophagy. "The
cannibalism so common in Sumatra derives in any case originally from the
desire to obtain, through the means of the eaten flesh of a newly-slain
man, the enrichment of one's own life-stock by his *tondi*" <span
id="fr_630"></span>[1](#fn_630.md)—that is, the many specific spirits which
animate his limbs and organs. The Bataks of to-day hardly realise the
motive, though their licit cannibalism is now limited to the eating of
brave warriors wounded and taken captive, and of certain criminals, as
aforesaid. <span id="fr_631"></span>[2](#fn_631.md) But with other
primitives there is no discrimination. An old Chinese description of
Tibet preserves record of a Tibetan practice of sending criminals of
certain kinds to be eaten by a tribe of savages north of Burma. <span
id="fr_632"></span>[3](#fn_632.md) The latter may have proceeded on the
Batak principle; but of this there is no trace, they being ostensibly
ready to eat anybody's exiles. Among the Manyema of Uganda, till the
other day or even now, it has been the rule that the dead are always
eaten by their kindred in the nearest village <span
id="fr_633"></span>[4](#fn_633.md)—a limitation which suggests modification
of an original kin-eating by the example of cannibalism after warfare.

The view that the criminal was a proper sacrifice, in fact, might
readily grow out of the circumstance that the earlier victims had been
normally captives; <span id="fr_634"></span>[5](#fn_634.md) and this
collocation of ideas we actually find in the custom of Dahome, where
human sacrifice was so recently and so systematically practised. The
annual victims, as distinguished from the holocaust at the death of a
king, were commonly captives and criminals, these being normally the
king's perquisite. <span id="fr_635"></span>[6](#fn_635.md) As the death
holocaust proceeded on the assumption that the king must enter the
Death-land well attended, so the annual sacrifices, which might number
about thirty, were contributions of filial piety to that retinue. The
time of sacrifice was accordingly the only time of capital punishment in
the year. <span id="fr_636"></span>[7](#fn_636.md) Here the process of
reasoning is

<span id="page_137">p. 137</span>

sufficiently transparent. If an enemy of the tribe from without could
suffice, so, it might be argued, would an enemy of the tribal law from
within, he being, besides, one of the king's or God's own people. And
among the Aztecs, accordingly, we find the law decreeing that thieves
who had stolen gold and silver—thieves *par excellence*, so to
speak—were annually sacrificed with the regular victims to the God Xipe,
patron of the goldsmiths. Like many other victims, they were flayed, and
the priest wore their skins, thus figuring as the God in their
persons. <span id="fr_637"></span>[1](#fn_637.md)

We have, again, the record of Caesar that in the wholesale human
sacrifices of the Gauls the offering up of those who had committed
thefts or other crimes was considered "*more* grateful to the immortal
Gods"; but that "when the supply of that species fell short, they
*descended* to sacrifices of the innocent." <span
id="fr_638"></span>[2](#fn_638.md) And there is reason to think, with M. de
Belloguet, <span id="fr_639"></span>[3](#fn_639.md) that the peculiar
sacrifices in question (in which numbers of men were burned alive in
large *simulacra*) were derived from some early Carthaginian or other
Phœnician cult. Needless to say, the simple recoil in more civilised
periods from the idea of a wilful sacrifice of the innocent—a recoil
clearly seen in Greek and Semitic legends—would encourage the resort for
victims to the unfortunates under sentence of death.

Finally, we have the express statement of Porphyry that in the annual
sacrifice of a man to the ancient Semitic deity Kronos at Rhodes, a
prisoner condemned to death was selected and kept till the Kronian
festival, when he was led outside the city gates and, *having been given
wine to drink*, put to death. <span id="fr_640"></span>[4](#fn_640.md) Here
we have at length a close parallel in the Mediterranean world to what we
have seen reason to regard as a typical detail in the gospel
mystery-play. <span id="fr_641"></span>[5](#fn_641.md) The Kronian victim
at Rhodes we know cannot have been originally a criminal; and it is much
more likely than not that he originally personated either the God
Kronos, <span id="fr_642"></span>[6](#fn_642.md) or, as seems most
probable, the "only-begotten son" Ieoud, whom in a Phœnician myth <span
id="fr_643"></span>[7](#fn_643.md) Kronos is said to have sacrificed after
dressing him in royal robes. To this clue we shall return after a
further survey. In the meantime, we may take it as established (1) that
the giving of a narcotic to the

<span id="page_138">p. 138</span>

victim—which we have seen practised among the Khonds, and which we find
transferred in India and elsewhere to animal victims <span
id="fr_644"></span>[1](#fn_644.md) who are presumably surrogates—derives
from ancient usage; and (2) that the original purpose of the rite was
not held to be defeated by the selection for sacrifice of a prisoner
sentenced to death.

In a community where social duty was deeply impressed on all, as in
medieval Japan, it was possible to secure every year a victim who
practised ascetic abstinence, and was finally put to death on behalf of
the community, <span id="fr_645"></span>[2](#fn_645.md) and this may well
have been the early ideal. <span id="fr_646"></span>[3](#fn_646.md) As the
Japanese human scapegoat, though of course no longer sacrificed, is even
now called the "one-year god-master," and was anciently called "the
abstainer," it is not difficult to conceive that this may have been one
of the ways in which kingship grew up. <span
id="fr_647"></span>[4](#fn_647.md) But in more sophisticated societies, as
we know, the extremer obligations of the kingship were overridden, and
victims must in most States have been hard to procure. <span
id="fr_648"></span>[5](#fn_648.md) It is true that in primitive communities
the fear of death seems surprisingly slight among doomed victims; <span
id="fr_649"></span>[6](#fn_649.md) and the known readiness of Chinamen to
sell themselves as substitutes for condemned criminals points the same
moral. But none the less there has been an evolution of the faculty of
apprehension. An intermediate stage is seen in the medieval State of
Malabar, where condemned men volunteered to immolate themselves in
honour of a God, giving themselves twelve wounds with as many knives,
and thereby winning funeral honours. <span
id="fr_650"></span>[7](#fn_650.md) The tendency in less rigorously drilled
communities than Japan would be, first, towards a general unwillingness
which had to be met by the bribe of a year's licence, and, later, to a
state of things in which nobody would volunteer, and the victim must be
either bred and bought, as among the Khonds, or taken from among the
condemned criminals. These, however, would include persons condemned for
impiety, who even for the Christians were explicitly *anathemata*, that
is, objects "devoted" to the Gods. <span id="fr_651"></span>[8](#fn_651.md)
The same title of *anathema* 

<span id="page_139">p. 139</span>

was given to the sacred objects hung up or deposited in the temples and
to the man denounced for impiety. <span id="fr_652"></span>[1](#fn_652.md)
So that, even if the widespread usage of granting abnormal privileges to
the victim, whether human or animal, <span
id="fr_653"></span>[2](#fn_653.md) were originally a way of asserting his
divinity, a criminal was not ineligible.

Thus, though it does not seem to be clearly proved that the victims put
to death in the Thargelia festival at Athens were latterly
criminals, <span id="fr_654"></span>[3](#fn_654.md) it is highly probable
that they were. Early religion looked to the physical side of sacrifice;
and if the criminal were whole, no question of his fitness would arise
for more primitive worshippers, save where, as among the Khonds, the
practice of purchase set up a special credence. <span
id="fr_655"></span>[4](#fn_655.md) In one Greek sacrifice, indeed, that
performed at Leucadia, an "ugly or deformed person" seems to have been
chosen as the victim. <span id="fr_656"></span>[5](#fn_656.md) When, again,
the developing religious consciousness became capable of shrinking from
the anomaly of calling a criminal "sacred," there was, as we shall see
later, a symbolical way out of the difficulty.

Symbolism, too, would further the modification of the sacrificial meal.
Long before the more civilised peoples revolted from the act of human
sacrifice, they would recoil, we must suppose, from the act of
anthropophagy; and in regard to many rites of human sacrifice we find
stories of substitution of animals and of waxen and other images and
cakes by order of humane kings. <span id="fr_657"></span>[6](#fn_657.md)
The Roman devices of the kind are well known, and their resort to images
of straw is paralleled among the Gonds of India in our own time; <span
id="fr_658"></span>[7](#fn_658.md) while the modern Malays offer dough
models of human beings, called "the substitute," <span
id="fr_659"></span>[8](#fn_659.md) and the Bataks of Sumatra employ a
number of symbolic sacrifices of images of human beings, some made of
bananas, some of wood—all plainly suggestive of a process of
substitution for former human sacrifices. <span
id="fr_660"></span>[9](#fn_660.md) The same process of substitution may be
confidently inferred in the case of the rite practised in the Chinese

<span id="page_140">p. 140</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Spring Festival,
held annually on the fourth of February. The chief magistrate of each
department, crowned with flowers, is carried in a chair in procession,
surrounded by figures representing mythological personages; and before
him is carried a huge decorated figure of a buffalo, in terra-cotta,
with gilded horns, behind which goes a child, with one foot shod and the
other naked, who constantly beats the buffalo. Behind him march
labourers carrying their agricultural implements; and the procession
goes out (and returns) by the eastern gate of the town, "to meet the
spring." When it is over, the buffalo is broken up, and the pieces, with
a vast number of small buffalo figures carried in the interior of the
figure, are distributed to all the people; whereafter the governor
delivers a discourse in praise of agriculture. <span
id="fr_661"></span>[1](#fn_661.md) What has historically taken place,
doubtless, is first a substitution of a buffalo, as among the Khonds,
for the original human victim, of whom the flower-crowned governor is a
surviving trace. Later, Chinese thrift and mandarin policy substituted
an image for the buffalo, adding a multitude of small figures of it for
distribution with the pieces of the image, as was once done in the case
of the living victim.

For the rest, the turn of mind which made myths out of the misunderstood
survivals of totemism would have no difficulty in finding reasons for
eating any given animal in the worship of any given God, whether or not
the primordial sacrifice had been that of an animal. Thus the
worshippers of Dionysos could feel they were commemorating the
dismemberment of the God when they ate the raw flesh of a bull or a kid;
other devotees ate a young dog; <span id="fr_662"></span>[2](#fn_662.md)
and further symbolic modification easily followed, on lines common to
many pagan cults.

<span id="fn_614"></span>[134:2](pch32.htm#fr_614.md) J. G. Müller, as
cited, p. 632. "Cannibalism as it now exists among them \[the
Nigerians\] is purely a religious relic." "It is evident that
cannibalism not only had. but still has, a spiritual or sacrificial
significance" (Major Glyn Leonard, *The Lower Niger and its Tribes*,
1906, pp. 324, 403). Mr. Basil Thomson pronounces no less emphatically,
as to the cannibalism of the Fijians, that "the tabus and ceremonies
surrounding it clearly indicate its religious origin," giving many
details in support (*The Fijians: A Study in the Decay of Custom*, 1908,
p. 104). Similarly Major Mockler-Ferryman (*British West Africa*, as
cited, p. 390) pronounces that the religious psychic idea of
cannibalism, as being ordained by the Gods, "is the primary cause of
West African cannibalism, and very possibly the origin of it among
anthropophagous peoples." Among the Sese Islanders of the Victoria
Nyanza, again, there is a secret society, the Bachichi, whose object is
to continue the custom of eating the dead (Cunningham, *Uganda and its
Peoples*, 1905, p. 73; Sir H. Johnston, *The Uganda Protectorate*, 1902,
ii, 692-3; Liberia, 1906, ii, 1059). See below, [p. 136](#page_136.md). The
cannibal Papuans of New Guinea, it is noted, "would not.....commit
cannibalism in the presence of a white man or a native woman" (A. E.
Pratt, *Two Years among the Cannibals of New Guinea*, 1906, p. 224). The
same observation applies to the Fijians (Thomson, as above cited). See
W. Schneider, *Die Naturvölker*, 1885, i, 195-200, for the theory that
religious cannibalism began as an imitation of the supposed practice of
the Gods. Cp. Thomson, as cited, p. 103; Rev. R. Taylor, *Te Ika a
Maui*, p. 191; and Peschel, as cited, p. 164. Prof, Robertson Smith
similarly argues that Arab sacrifices were neither gifts to the Gods
nor—even in the sacrifice of first-born sons—offerings of what was most
precious to the sacrificer, but offerings of the most sacred kind of
victim, as the sacred blood of the species there flows purest and
strongest (*Rel. of Semites*, 2nd ed. note E, p. 465). This squares to
some extent with the view ascribed to Varro (in Augustine, *Civ. Dei*,
vii, 19) that the Phœnicians and the Gauls offered human sacrifices
*quia omnium seminum optimum est genus humanum*.

<span id="fn_615"></span>[134:3](pch32.htm#fr_615.md) MM. Hubert et Mauss,
in their valuable *Essai sur le sacrifice* (*L’Année Sociologique*, 2e
Année, 1899), seem to argue that sanctity was in all cases wholly
conferred on the victim by the ritual. This was certainly the rule, but
there were exceptions, notably in the case of human victims. The
essential point is that every victim had something divine (*Id*. p.
127).

<span id="fn_616"></span>[134:4](pch32.htm#fr_616.md) Cp. Frazer, *G. B.*

barbaric mind regarded the executed criminal very much as it did the
enemy in battle; and the "devoting" of captured enemies as sacrifices is
anciently common to Hebrews, Teutons (above, § 4), American indigenes
(below, Part IV, § 5), Romans (Livy, viii, 10), and Greeks (Diodorus
Siculus, xi, 65). As to the connection of sacrifice with execution see

to "certain criminals—for example, adulterers." The selection is
explained by the *tondi* motive, adulterers being instances of excessive
sexual energy.

ascetic motives have been frequently deified in modern times (Crooke,
The *Religion and Folklore of Northern India*, as cited, i, 193). This
squares with the deification of Amilcar by the Carthaginians on the
score that he had sacrificed himself for his country (Herod. vii, 167).
