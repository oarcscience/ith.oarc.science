#### § 10. Conclusion.

On the other hand, the promotion of material well-being is precisely
what is oftenest claimed for Christianity; and the argument is
presumably changed in the case of Peru and Mexico only because there it
would break down. For the great fact about these heathen civilisations
is that they did attain material well-being, as apart from humane
feeling, in a considerable degree; though, as we have seen, they were
suffering much from sacerdotalism and autocracy. If we do not say with
Dr. Draper that the Spaniards destroyed a higher civilisation than their
own, we may at least say that the one they destroyed was in many ways
superior to that which they put in its place. What they did was
completely to destroy the civilisations they found, without replacing
them at all in large measure. In the matters of road-making,
agriculture, and the administration of law, the new civilisation was not
to be compared with the old, which, indeed, was on these points ahead of
anything in Europe since the fall of the Roman Empire. <span
id="fr_1979"></span>[4](#fn_1979.md) The Aztecs had clean streets, and
lighted streets, when Europe had not. Dr. Réville,

<span id="page_381">p. 381</span>

indeed, lays undue stress on the lighting of the streets, which was not
done by lamps, but by fires; <span id="fr_1980"></span>[1](#fn_1980.md) but
even that was an improvement on the European state of things two hundred
years ago. Peru to-day is in large part a desolation compared with what
it was under the Incas; and under the new religion the native races seem
to be positively lower than under the old. By the testimony of Catholic
priests, the conquerors nearly exterminated the Aztec races, the numbers
destroyed by their cruelties being reckoned at twelve millions. And on
the side of morality and humanity, who shall say what the gain was in
Mexico when the Christian conquerors, after execrating the practice of
human sacrifice, set up their own Holy Inquisition to claim its victims
for the propitiation of the three new Gods, harrying still further the
people they had already decimated by atrocious tyranny and cruelty?

It is little to the purpose to urge, as was done by Joseph de
Maistre, <span id="fr_1981"></span>[2](#fn_1981.md) that "the immense
charity of the Catholic priesthood" sought to protect the natives in
every way from the cruelty and avarice of the conquerors. It is in the
nature of all priesthoods in close connection with the people to seek or
wish its good in some way: <span id="fr_1982"></span>[3](#fn_1982.md) the
Mexican priests, as we have seen, enjoined beneficence, and they treated
their own vassals well. <span id="fr_1983"></span>[4](#fn_1983.md) But when
the Christian apologist declares that he has "no knowledge of a single
act of violence laid to the charge of the priests," save in the one case
of Valverde in Peru, <span id="fr_1984"></span>[5](#fn_1984.md) he goes far
indeed beyond his brief. There were certainly humane priests, as Las
Casas and Sahagun; but what but "acts of violence" were the whole
efforts of the priesthood to destroy the ancient monuments and records,
to say nothing of the operations of the Inquisition? It is not, however,
in mere "acts of violence" that the fatality of Christian junction with
non-Christian civilisation lies: it belongs to the nature of the case;
and religious principle, which encouraged the original act of conquest,
is worse than powerless to avert the consequences. If the more forward
races will not leave the more backward alone, and cannot blend with them
in a common stock, they must do one of three things: exercise a mere
supervision, good or bad, as Englishmen do in India, where they cannot
breed; or crowd the weaker out, as is being done in North America and
Australia; or strangle the lower civilisation

<span id="page_382">p. 382</span>

without developing the higher, as has been done in Mexico and Peru by
Christians, and in Egypt by Saracens. Whether a race fusion can take
place in Mexico, Peru, and Brazil remains to be seen. If it be attained,
those countries will have solved a problem which in the United States,
in a worse form, seems far from solution.

In that case, a relative success may finally be claimed for the Catholic
as against the Protestant evolution. But it will be due to other causes
than religion. It may, indeed, be charged against the Catholic Church
that its unchangeable hostility to the spread of knowledge has been the
means of paralysing progress in countries where, as in Mexico and Peru,
it has been able to attain absolute dominion over minds and bodies. "It
seems hard," says Dr. Tylor, <span id="fr_1985"></span>[1](#fn_1985.md) "to
be always attacking the Catholic clergy; but of one thing we cannot
remain in doubt—that their influence has had more to do than anything
else with the doleful ignorance which reigns supreme in Mexico." But it
is not Catholicism that is the explanation. "The only difference," avows
Dr. Brinton, <span id="fr_1986"></span>[2](#fn_1986.md) "in the results of
the two great divisions of the Christian world," in the matter of
conquests, "seems to be that on Catholic missions has followed the
debasement, on Protestant missions the destruction, of the race." It may
be added that in Protestant Natal to-day there is a general
determination among the white population to keep the natives uneducated,
lest knowledge should give them power. In fine, the claim that there is
an inherent civilising virtue in Christianity is here, as elsewhere,
turned to confusion. "Christianity," as the same writer declares, <span
id="fr_1987"></span>[3](#fn_1987.md) "has shown itself incapable of
controlling its inevitable adjuncts; and it would have been better,
morally and socially, for the American race never to have known
Christianity at all than to have received it on the only terms on which
it has been possible to offer it."

What Christendom could best have done for the American civilisations,
after putting down human sacrifice, was to leave them to grow, like
those of China and Japan, under the influence of superior example at
certain points. Progress might then conceivably have come about. <span
id="fr_1988"></span>[4](#fn_1988.md) There is little use in speculating
over the

<span id="page_383">p. 383</span>

it might-have-been; but at least we should not overlook the fact that in
Peru there are distinct records of rationalism among the theocratic
Incas themselves. Several of these remarkable rulers <span
id="fr_1989"></span>[1](#fn_1989.md) are recorded to have expressed the
conviction that the Sun, for ever moving in his allotted course, could
not be the Supreme Deity he was said to be—that there must be another
Deity who ruled him. <span id="fr_1990"></span>[2](#fn_1990.md)
Netzahualcoyotl, we saw, thought similarly. This reminds us that in all
ages and under all religions there have been Freethinkers; men who knew
that the Gods were myths while the Vedic hymns were being made;
Sadducees among the Jews; Mu’tazilites among the Mohammedans. For the
history of mental evolution has not been that of a simple process from
delusion to rationalism, but of a constant war between the two
tendencies in the human mind; and what has happened s hitherto is just
that inasmuch as the majority have thought little they have been
credulous. To measure the position of any nation in this regard, we have
for the most part simply to consider the status and expansive power of
its priesthood. And for us to-day there is one special lesson to be
drawn from the case of the unbelieving Incas, who never modified their
theocratic practice as regarded the multitude, whatever they might deem
among themselves. Their principle evidently was that the masses must be
deluded. Well, we know that when the royal line fell, those masses were
wholly unable to act for themselves, and fell abjectly under the sway of
a mere handful of conquerors. Unless the masses also rationalise, they
will never attain a worthy humanity. So that the Freethinkers had need
be more righteous than the Scribes and Pharisees.

It is the more necessary to insist on this, the final lesson of all
comparative hierology, because in the face of all the facts some
students contrive, with the best intentions, to invert it. Because
supernaturalism has always been associated with ethics in religious
history, it is fallaciously inferred that there can be no ethic without
supernaturalism; and in order to shield from rational criticism the

<span id="page_384">p. 384</span>

prevailing creed, emphasis is laid on every point at which in its
evolution it has chanced to be associated with the principle of
betterment. This was the point of view of one of the first scientific
investigators on the comparative principle, Benjamin Constant, whose
treatise *De la Religion, considerée dans sa source, ses formes, ses
développements*, published in 1824-34, is still worth attention.
Developing the principles of Fontenelle and Des Brosses, he set forth,
clearly and insistently, two generations before Mr. Lang, the presence
of savage survivals in the religions of civilised antiquity; <span
id="fr_1991"></span>[1](#fn_1991.md) and while accepting Hume's
demonstration of the priority of polytheism <span
id="fr_1992"></span>[2](#fn_1992.md) he anticipated Mr. Lang's theorem
about the good Supreme Being who "could not be squared," <span
id="fr_1993"></span>[3](#fn_1993.md) even as he framed a number of the
theses employed by Dr. Jevons for the vindication of religious
intuitionism, such as the utility of taboo and the opposition between
religion and magic. <span id="fr_1994"></span>[4](#fn_1994.md) Long before
it was fashionable to do so, he adopted and developed Lessing's thesis
of the progressive development of all religion; <span
id="fr_1995"></span>[5](#fn_1995.md) Comte's law of the three stages he
anticipated by one of four stages, which is perhaps better
grounded; <span id="fr_1996"></span>[6](#fn_1996.md) and some of his
solutions are both ingenious and just, more just than some of those of
his successors who follow similar lines. Yet by reason of his desire to
glorify "the religious sentiment" in the abstract and in the present
time, apart from all the "forms" of religion, he repeatedly lapses into
crude sophistry. After insisting that the religious sentiment is
"universal" he speaks of "irreligious peoples"; <span
id="fr_1997"></span>[7](#fn_1997.md) and wherever he has to admit that
religion has wrought tyranny and evil he alleges that just there the
religious sentiment has left it, that it has become merely interest,
egoism, calculation. <span id="fr_1998"></span>[8](#fn_1998.md) On this
very principle, religion is beneficent only momentarily, when it is
taking shape as a reform of old religion by innovators; each innovation
in turn becoming a matter of form, interest, egoism, calculation; so
that "the religious sentiment," so far from being universal, turns out
to be the sentiment only of innovators, freethinkers, enemies of
traditionalism. After being represented as "sweet and consoling" for the
mass of men, "the spirit of religion" turns out to be precisely what the
mass of men never at any one moment entertain. All the while, it is
pretended on à priori grounds that rationalism must always lend itself
to

<span id="page_385">p. 385</span>

fatalistic submission, as if religious reform were not relative
rationalism; and the colossal historical facts of religious fatalism,
religious tyranny, religious cruelty, religious licence, are glosed as
phenomena of irreligion.

From this long-drawn contradiction there is only one way of escape—the
recognition that the sole rational test of any religious credence or
usage at any moment is its truth, relatively to the intelligence of the
moment. Mechanically repeating that religion is a fundamental
"sentiment," men lose sight and hold of the truth that veracity is also
a sentiment, with inalienable rights. The men who, in terms of religious
credences, have reformed religion in the past, have done so in the
conviction that the credences they discarded were *not true*. To argue
that, because their credences were associated for a time with moral or
material improvement, we must cherish those credences even when we know
them to be untrue, is to be false not only to their ideal but to the
very principle of development. Such an acceptance is in itself
corruption, the negation of betterment; and to turn the historic fact of
the relativity of religious beliefs into a general vindication of
religion is to read the law of evolution backwards. Bad or mistaken
morals are relatively "fit," even as is false belief. It has been argued
that cannibalism once saved the human race; and the proposition may be
perfectly true; but so far from being an argument for reversion to
cannibalism, it does not even cancel the fact that cannibalism has again
and again gone far to destroy low civilisations.

Religious belief has been historically associated with both the progress
and the paralysis of civilisation; and the just inference is that, so
far from its being *the* principle of betterment, it is simply a form of
fallacious mental activity, which may either be countervailed by truer
forms or may countervail them. And the beliefs which have the worst
concomitants are precisely those certified by the special pleaders as
"truly" religious. The belief in immortality, so often extolled as a
great source of consolation, has been the motive for the slaughter of
unnumbered millions of human beings, religiously doomed to accompany
others to "another world"; the conception of sacrificial salvation,
another source of "blessed comfort," has incited to the slaughter of
uncounted millions more, with every circumstance of heart-searing
atrocity; the doctrine of sacramental communion with deity, as we have
seen, has been the means of conserving and sanctifying systematic
cannibalism at the hands of priesthoods, where without priesthoods it
must have died out; and in every age and stage of human growth the
religious

<span id="page_386">p. 386</span>

sentiment, of which the most essential and constant characteristic is to
cling to "forms," is seen on the intellectual side damning new thought,
strangling science, sanctifying injustice, and haloing war, as well as
endorsing what measure of moral principle had been evolved in a lower
stage of thought. There is never the slightest security that the spirit
of justice and reason and sympathy will coincide with "the spirit of
religion"; and there is no known religious system which is not
habitually turned to the frustration of some of the best of the precepts
it professes to inculcate. There is thus no reason to doubt that in
savage as in civilised times the forces of organised religion have been
arrayed against the forces of betterment, social as well as
intellectual, with but a dubious record on the side of moralisation.

Certain hierologists on religious grounds make much of the fact that
some of the "lowest" races appear to have the "highest" notions of a
Supreme Being, as if that were not a specially plain proof of the
futility of theistic notions as civilising forces. "Fijian religion," we
are told, draws "an impassable line between ghosts and eternal
gods." <span id="fr_1999"></span>[1](#fn_1999.md) And the apparent effect
of that discrimination was to keep the Fijians the most revolting set of
cannibals on the face of the earth, <span
id="fr_2000"></span>[2](#fn_2000.md) habitually eating their own species
because the Eternal Gods preferred so to feed; while in the mysteries of
their Supreme Being there were scenes of "almost incredible indecency."
Precisely where men drew the least clear distinction between ghosts and
Eternal Gods, that is to say among the Tongans, cannibalism was
abandoned till Fijian influence revived it; and the position of women
was immensely better. <span id="fr_2001"></span>[3](#fn_2001.md) And all
the while, the more brutal the religion, the more complacent were the
worshippers. The unconscious testimony of a missionary may help to make
the point clearer

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">The religious system of the Samoans differs
essentially from that which obtained at the Tahitian, Society, and other
islands with which we are acquainted. They have neither maraes nor
temples nor offerings; and, *consequently*, none of the barbarian and
sanguinary rites observed at the other groups. In consequence of this,
the Samoans were considered an impious race, and their impiety became
proverbial with the people of Raratonga \[one of the Hervey Islands\];
for when upbraiding a person who neglected the worship of the
gods,</span>

</div>

<span id="page_387">p. 387</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">they would call him 'a godless Samoan.'
But......this people had 'lords many and gods many';" <span
id="fr_2002"></span>[1](#fn_2002.md)</span>

</div>

and the belief in these, by the missionary's account, was associated
with vice and absurdity.

As between the Samoan and the Fijian, our sole test is the critical
reason. It is by the same test that we pronounce given religious
doctrines incredible or inconsistent, apart from any question of their
effects. Let that criticism be honestly met on its own ground, instead
of by way of paralogisms concerning the utility of false beliefs in the
past, and hierology will be freed from an element of disturbance and
distortion, becoming as nearly as possible a department of pure history.
It is the tactic of the special pleader for religion that has introduced
that element: it lies with him to let it vanish. Doubtless it will
reappear in sociology; but there it will be for the time a quickening
force, giving vitality to a science that is slow to be vivified by
actual interests.

language, in particular, shows great capabilities. "Of all the languages
spoken on the American continent, the Aztec is the most perfect and
finished, approaching in this respect the tongues of Europe and Asia,
and actually surpassing many of them by its elegance and expression.
Although wanting the six consonants, *b*, *d*, *f*, *r*, *g*, *s*, it
may still be called full and rich. Of its copiousness, the *Natural
History* of Dr. Hermandez gives evidence, in which are described twelve
hundred different species of Mexican plants, two hundred or more species
of birds, and a large number of quadrupeds, reptiles, insects, and
metals, each of which is given its proper name in the Mexican language.
Mendieta <span id="page_383">p. 383</span> says that it is not excelled
in beauty by the Latin, displaying even more art in its construction,
and abounding in tropes and metaphors. Camargo calls it the richest of
the whole land, and the purest, being mixed with no foreign barbaric
element; Gomara says it is the best, most copious, and most extended in
all New Spain; Davila Padilla, that it is very elegant and graceful,
although it contains many metaphors which make it difficult; Loreozana,
that it is very elegant, sweet, and complete; Clavigero, that it is
copious, Polite, and expressive; Brasseur de Bourbourg, that from the
most sublime heights it descends to common things with a sonorousness
and richness of expression peculiar to itself. The missionaries found it
ample for their purpose, as in it, and without the aid of foreign words,
they could express all the shades of their dogmas" (Bancroft, iii,
727-8).
