#### § 9. Buddhism and Buddhas.

Our English guide, than whom no man knows more of Buddhism, gives us a
definition: "There can be little doubt but that the doctrines of the
Four Noble Truths and of the Noble Eightfold Path, the 'Foundation of
the Kingdom of Righteousness,' were not only the teaching of Gotama
himself, but were the central and most

<span id="page_242">p. 242</span>

essential part of it." <span id="fr_1206"></span>[1](#fn_1206.md) The
teachings in question are too well known to need quotation here: they
are simply a formal and symmetrical statement of the rules of
self-repression by which the Buddhist is to attain the inward peace of
Nirvana, or deliverance from blind desires. Let us then assume that
these teachings are for Buddhism primordial: what is there to prove that
they are the utterances of one Gotama, "the Sakya sage"; and that his
proclamation of them set up an "Order" of disciples?

The Order, by all accounts, was one of Mendicants. Either there were, or
there were not, such Orders in existence before the Buddhist. If not, we
are to suppose that one man, by the simple proclamation of a certain set
of quietest principles, calling for self-restraint without any painful
self-mortification, induced numbers of men and women, many of them
instructed, to take up a new way of life in a country not much given to
changes or experiments, and through this host of disciples instituted an
Order that was to set a great mark on the history of religion. The
unlikeliness of such a sudden growth will be generally granted; and
indeed it is fully conceded—though this is rarely mentioned in the more
popular accounts of Buddhism—that a *Sangha* or Society of the kind was
no new phenomenon in Buddha's day. <span
id="fr_1207"></span>[2](#fn_1207.md) There seem to have been many; and the
Buddhist Order avowedly copied their practices:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">According to Buddhist tradition—and we see no
sufficient reason for doubting the correctness of the account—the monks
of other, that is, non-Buddhistic sects, used to meet together at the
middle and at the close of every half-month, and were accustomed then to
proclaim their new teaching in public. At such times......the different
sects found an opportunity of increasing their numbers and their
influence. The Buddhists also adopted the custom of these periodical
meetings, but confined themselves to meeting twice in each month. <span
id="fr_1208"></span>[3](#fn_1208.md)</span>

</div>

Our authorities argue indeed that the penitential practice of the
Buddhist meetings "*seems* <span id="fr_1209"></span>[4](#fn_1209.md) to
have been an original invention of *the Buddhists themselves*"; but here
we have on the one hand an avowal that the Buddhists "invented" notable
usages not prescribed by the traditional Founder, and on the other hand
a failure to demonstrate that the Buddhist practice was not
pre-Buddhistic. <span id="fr_1210"></span>[5](#fn_1210.md) On the face

<span id="page_243">p. 243</span>

of the case, the claim is distinctly improbable, in view of the other
data. For the rest, the Jainist movement admittedly dates from the same
period; mendicant sages are recognised in the Buddhist books as common
phenomena before Buddha; <span id="fr_1211"></span>[1](#fn_1211.md) and the
same kinds of rules of conduct seem to have been general, save that the
Buddhist was not so painfully ascetic as some others.

The Buddhist movement, then, was one on anciently familiar lines. What
is more, the title of "the Buddha," which means "the enlightened," so
far from making claim to a new departure, was an implicit acknowledgment
of continuance in established ideals.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"In the Pâli and Sanskrit texts the word Buddha is
always used as a title, not as a name. The historical Buddha is
represented to have taught that he was only one of a long series of
Buddhas who appear at intervals in the world, and who *all teach the
same system*. After the death of each Buddha his religion flourishes for
a time and then decays, till it is at last completely forgotten, and
wickedness and violence rule over the earth. Gradually then the world
improves; until at last a new Buddha appears who again preaches the lost
Dharma or Truth.....The names of twenty-four of these Buddhas who
appeared previous to Gotama have been handed down to us.....The
*Buddhavansa* or 'History of the Buddhas'.....gives the lives of all the
previous Buddhas before commencing the account of Gotama himself; and
the Pâli commentary on the Jâtakas gives certain details regarding each
of the twenty-four." <span id="fr_1212"></span>[2](#fn_1212.md)</span>

</div>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> The number and the
names may very well be, as our historian argues, late inventions; but
there can be no question as to the fact of the belief. An early
tradition avows that, after "the" Buddha had made sixty converts in
three months, sent them in different directions to preach and teach, and
again converted the whole population of Rajagriha, the capital of King
Bimbisâra, he encountered a period of hostility, in which his disciples
were ridiculed as preachers of a doctrine of depopulation. Appealed to
by them for counsel, he advised them "to say that the Buddha was only
trying to preach righteousness, as former Buddhas had done." <span
id="fr_1213"></span>[3](#fn_1213.md) Even in the late Commentary of
Buddhaghosa on the Dialogues of Gotama, "the Blessed One" is represented
as exhorting his disciples to be earnest, because "hard is it to meet
with a Buddha in the world." <span id="fr_1214"></span>[4](#fn_1214.md) So
in

<span id="page_244">p. 244</span>

the Dhamma-pada we have the text: "A Buddha is not easily found.
Wherever such a sage is born, the race prospers." <span
id="fr_1215"></span>[1](#fn_1215.md) And the name Bhagavâ, "the Blessed
One," is equally impersonal, the Buddhist traditions themselves telling
of Gotama's discussions with "Bhagavâ, Alâra, and Udraka." <span
id="fr_1216"></span>[2](#fn_1216.md) Finally, in the fourth century of our
era, "there was certainly near to Srâvasti a sect of Buddhists who
rejected Gotama, reverencing only *the three previous Buddhas*, and
especially Kâsyapa, whose body they believed to be buried under one of
the dâgabas at which they, *as well as the orthodox*, worshipped, while
another was said to be built over the spot where he had died." <span
id="fr_1217"></span>[3](#fn_1217.md)

There were probably current, then, at and before the time of Gotama's
alleged teaching, any number of teachings credited to "the Buddha" and
"the Blessed One"; and these might include many afterwards ascribed to
Gotama. Given, then, an absolute absence of evidence for the
transcription of any teachings of Gotama in his lifetime, on what
grounds are we to believe that they were *with knowledge* ascribed to a
man of that name, whose life answered to the non-supernatural details
given in the legends? Nay, seeing that even the name Gautama or Gotama
is on the one hand a common one, <span id="fr_1218"></span>[4](#fn_1218.md)
and on the other hand (as "Gautama of the race of Gotama") full of
mythological associations; <span id="fr_1219"></span>[5](#fn_1219.md) and
seeing further that there was admittedly *another* Gotama known to the
early Buddhists who also founded an Order, <span
id="fr_1220"></span>[6](#fn_1220.md) what proof is there that sayings and
doings of different Gotamas may not have been ascribed to one person? On
the view, again, that the Four Noble Truths and the Noble Eightfold Path
are the oldest doctrines of the Buddhist movement, and were formulated
by one Gotama, what reason is there to believe that the movement either
(*a*) arose or (*b*) made any progress on the simple basis of those
teachings? Baur, believing in the historicity of the Gospel Jesus, yet
makes the avowal: "How soon would everything true and important that was
taught by Christianity have been relegated to the series of long-faded
sayings of the noble humanitarians and thinking sages of antiquity, had
not its teachings become words of eternal life in the

<span id="page_245">p. 245</span>

mouth of its Founder?" <span id="fr_1221"></span>[1](#fn_1221.md) Similarly
may we not ask, How, in much-believing India, could any large organised
movement develop on the simple nucleus of a teaching of self-control,
which differed from the common practice of Hindu asceticism only in its
renunciation of positive self-maceration? Nay, supposing a sage to have
framed an eightfold path of "Right Belief, Right Aims, Right Speech,
Right Actions, Right *means of Livelihood*, Right Endeavour, Right
Mindfulness, Right Meditation," how should he intelligibly proceed to
establish his way by forming an Order of *Mendicants?* <span
id="fr_1222"></span>[2](#fn_1222.md) Our guide himself explains that these
"classified statements of moral truth" were "addressed to Brahmans
skilled in the dialectics of the time"; and they certainly have that
aspect. But why should they be offered as a primary code for a new
mendicant Order?

It will doubtless be answered that such à priori objection is
unwarranted; that we must take the evidence as we find it and recognise
as the primary teaching of the founder of Buddhism the doctrines
repeatedly ascribed to him in the oldest documents. But when we inquire
historically into the oldest documents and their authenticity we learn
from our leading instructors that the received tradition of the First
Buddhist Council which "collected the sayings of the Master" is proved
to be late and untrustworthy by an early Sutta, which gives all the
story of the heresy that is historically stated as the *motive* for the
Council, but says nothing of such a Council taking place. "The author of
the Mahâparinibhâna-Sutta," says Dr. Oldenberg, "did not know anything
of the First Council"; and Professor Rhys Davids agrees. <span
id="fr_1223"></span>[3](#fn_1223.md) And this very Sutta ("The Book of the
Great Decease") is open to suspicion of lateness, inasmuch as it makes
the Blessed One figure at the head of a great movement in his lifetime,
travelling sometimes with five hundred and sometimes with twelve hundred
and fifty disciples. What is more, it represents him as giving forth a
kind of teaching hard to reconcile with other doctrine ascribed to him
as typical; for in the very first chapter of the Sutta (§ 4) he is made
to lay it down as one of the conditions of the permanent prosperity of a
certain tribe of Vaggians that they "honour and esteem and revere and
support the Vaggian shrines in town or country, and allow not the proper
offerings and rites, as formerly given and performed, to fall into

<span id="page_246">p. 246</span>

desuetude." <span id="fr_1224"></span>[1](#fn_1224.md) It may well be said
of such a teacher that, so far from having opposed Hinduism and
"destroyed a system of iniquity and oppression and fraud," he "lived and
died a Hindu." <span id="fr_1225"></span>[2](#fn_1225.md) But does such
doctrine correlate with the denial of the permanence of the Gods, and of
the value of prayers and sacrifices, also ascribed to the Buddha by
tradition and documents?

The traditional First Council, then, which figures as the first
historical authority for the existence of the Buddha's teachings, is
later (if it ever took place at all) than a Sutta which ascribes to him
a teaching wholly different in spirit and aim from those commonly held
to be typical and essential in his doctrine. But indeed Pali scholars
are more and more convinced that the First Council is a mere literary
myth, to assign to which a historical date is to put a false
problem. <span id="fr_1226"></span>[3](#fn_1226.md) And if the First
Council thus goes by the board, of what value is the late tradition that
the Council of Vesâli was held a hundred years after the Buddha's death?
Our authorities argue that since the "Ten Points" said to have been
there vehemently discussed are not mentioned in the earlier sections of
the Mahâvagga, these must be prior to the Council; and that as the
Pâtimokkha is visibly older still, the last-named section of the Vinaya
must be very old indeed. <span id="fr_1227"></span>[4](#fn_1227.md) The
answer is (1) that the Council of Vesâli <span
id="fr_1228"></span>[5](#fn_1228.md) may have been centuries later than the
date traditionally assigned to it, and (2) that the Vinaya texts in
general, if relatively old, have nothing of the character of an
innovating propaganda, nothing of the nature of an appeal which would
create a new Order, but rather correspond to the late code of rules
framed for monastic orders in Christendom a thousand years after the
foundation of the Christian cult. The fact that they are all ascribed to
the Founder is but one more evidence of the total lack of the critical
or historical sense among the members.
