#### § 2. Reform as a Religious Process.

The case may become clearer if we look for illustration to the phenomena
of fictitious literature. It will hardly be suggested that the Semites
and Greeks who wrote religious treatises or hymns and ascribed them to
famous men of centuries before, were under a hallucination as to the
source of their thoughts. They did but seek for them the passport of a
name that challenged respect. Precisely, then, as the "prophetic" writer
put his words in the mouth of a dead prophet (a common way of aiming at
reforms), making *him* say, "Thus saith the Lord," so in many cases at
least the living prophet must have been perfectly conscious that his
spoken words were "not the Lord's, but his own." In fact, the saner the
prophet, and the saner his counsel, the more likely was he to know how
he came by it; though his feeling that he was on the side of the God
would greatly relieve his scruples about professing to be the God's
mouthpiece. The man who, on the other hand, was so far beside himself as
to suppose that Omnipotence was speaking through him, was much less
likely to have wise counsels to give. In any case, crazed or prudent,
right or wrong, all alike ran the risk of being denounced by the others
as "false prophets," <span id="fr_243"></span>[2](#fn_243.md) and stoned
accordingly. Thus reform was a matter either of persuading kings or of
managing fellow-priests and fellow-worshippers; and genius for
management would be fully as important as genius for righteousness.

In the case, for instance, of a substitution of animal for human
sacrifices, or of dough-dolls for sacrificial animals or men or
children,

<span id="page_64">p. 64</span>

the reformer of a priest-ruled cult had to play at once upon the
credulity and the self-interest of the worshippers. It is clear from the
Hebrew books that for the early Hebrews as for the Phœnicians the
first-born of man as well as of animals was at one time a customary
sacrifice; <span id="fr_244"></span>[1](#fn_244.md) and the myth of Abraham
and Isaac confesses the fact in the act of supplying a pretext for a
change. In the story of the sacrifice of Jephthah's daughter, again, it
is evident that human sacrifice must once have been normal to permit of
the idea of the application of the vow to a human being; and the
declaration that a special annual mourning was set up for the alleged
tragedy of mischance is an ethical fiction. In all likelihood the ground
of it was an annual sacrifice of a maiden, which was transmuted into an
act of lamentation for one traditionally sacrificed. So with the obvious
fiction of Joshua's imprecating on the rebuilder of Jericho the curse of
slaying his sons for the foundations: <span
id="fr_245"></span>[2](#fn_245.md) the practice had clearly been normal,
and the representing of it as a foredoomed horror is a late invention.
And no less clear is it, from the story of the sacrifice of a virgin
imposed by the Delphic Oracle on the Messenians in their war with the
Spartans, <span id="fr_246"></span>[3](#fn_246.md) that the practice,
wherever it originated, was religiously established among the early
Greeks.

Such story-telling as that of the Isaac myth, and that of the suicide of
the despairing Aristodemus, convinced that he had slain his daughter in
vain, <span id="fr_247"></span>[4](#fn_247.md) was the natural device <span
id="fr_248"></span>[5](#fn_248.md) of the humane reformer, who was much
more likely to be relatively a rationalist than to be abnormally subject
to religious ecstasies or trances. Mohammed is indeed a case to the
contrary, he being credited with opposing the practice of female
infanticide; but the very fact that in the Koran no tale is framed to
carry the point is a confirmation of our view. In an old cult, a bald
command to forego or reverse an established rite would be bewildering to
the worshippers, whereas a myth describing a process of commutation
would find easy acceptance where such a commutation was already
agreeable to normal feeling.

Normal feeling, on the other hand, was often the matrix of the

<span id="page_65">p. 65</span>

reformative idea. There was a natural tendency to relax human sacrifices
in times of prosperity unless a zealous priesthood insisted on
them; <span id="fr_249"></span>[1](#fn_249.md) and a long period of
prosperity would make men loth to shed the blood of their own children.
Thus either the political accident of a prolonged peace or the opening
of a new era of government was the probable condition of the effectual
arrest of child-sacrifice among the Hebrews; and the myth of Abraham and
Isaac and the ram was in all likelihood framed at such a time. Its
inclusion in a sacred book was some security against such a reversion to
child-sacrifice as we know to have occurred among the Carthaginians in
times of great distress or danger, after periods in which it was
disused. <span id="fr_250"></span>[2](#fn_250.md) The same tendency is
implied in the story—whether true or false—of a cannibal sacrament among
the members of the conspiracy of Catiline. <span
id="fr_251"></span>[3](#fn_251.md) Nations, like men, are apt to be driven
to worse courses by terror and disaster; <span
id="fr_252"></span>[4](#fn_252.md) and it is not only conceivable but
probable that the Hebrews made their main steps towards religious
betterment when they were temporarily razed from the list of the nations
and set to cultivate their religious consciousness in a captivity which
withheld them from political vicissitude without reducing them to
slavery. <span id="fr_253"></span>[5](#fn_253.md)

For the explanation of religious evolution, then, we must look not so
much to genius for right thought as to genius for hitting the common
taste or for outmanœuvring rival cults. By far the clearest case of
cult- or creed-shaping by a single genius is that of Mohammed; <span
id="fr_254"></span>[6](#fn_254.md)

<span id="page_66">p. 66</span>

and here, to the historical eye, it is the political expansion of Islam
at a critical moment that makes the fortunes of the faith, not the rise
of the faith that makes the fortune of the Moslems. Had not the Saracens
at the moment of the successful emergence of Mohammed's movement found
their chance to overrun great territories of the enfeebled Christian
empire, that movement might never have been aught but an obscure tribal
worship, or might indeed have been speedily overlaid by the surrounding
polytheism. It was the sense of triumphant opposition to Christian
tritheism and Mary-worship and to Persian fire-worship that sharply
defined the Moslem dogma; and once a religion has its sacred book, its
tradition of triumph, and its established worship, the conservatism of
the religious instinct counts for much more in preserving it than the
measure of genius that went to the making of its doctrine. Every
religion, in fact, sees supreme genius, both literary and religious, in
its own Bible simply because it is such. No Christian can have a
devouter conviction of the splendour of his sacred books than the Moslem
enjoys concerning the Koran, the Brahman over the Vedas, or the Buddhist
in respect of the large literature of his system.

<span id="fn_245"></span>[64:2](pch20.htm#fr_245.md) Josh. vi, 26; 1 Kings
xvi, 34. It is not unlikely that the sons of King Hiel were sacrificed
to the God Joshua. See below, Pt. II, ch. i, § 10.

<span id="fn_248"></span>[64:5](pch20.htm#fr_248.md) Compare the myth
(Apollodorus, iv, 3, § 2) of the kid substituted for the child Dionysos
by Zeus to save him from Hêrê (a myth with a purpose) and that of the
bull substituted for a man in sacrifice by the intervention of the Khond
God Boora (Macpherson, *Memorials of Service in India*, 1865, p. 109).
There is reason to surmise that the story of Perseus and Andromeda may
derive from a similar suppression of a sacrificial rite. Cp. Frazer,
*Lectures on the History of Early Kingship*, 1905, pp. 182, 184.

<span id="fn_249"></span>[65:1](pch20.htm#fr_249.md) See below, Part IV, as
to the Aztecs; and cp. Prof. Granger, *The Worship of the Romans*, 1895,
p. 300.

<span id="fn_250"></span>[65:2](pch20.htm#fr_250.md) Diodorus Siculus, xx,
14; Plutarch, *De Superstitione*, end; *Regum et imper. apophthegmata:*
*Gelon*, f; Porphyry, *De Abstinentia*, ii, 56; Plato, *Minos*, p. 315
C.; Justin, xvii, 6; Varro, in Augustine, *De civ. Dei*, vii, 19. Cp.
Macpherson, *Memorials of Service in India*, pp. 113-115, as to special
pressures. The many wars and straits of the Carthaginians is the
reasonable explanation of their reversion to child-sacrifice at a time
when it had been long disused in Tyre. See F. W. Newman (*Miscellanies*,
1869, p. 302) as to the case of Tyre (Quintus Curtius, iv, 3, § 38).
Prof. Newman, in throwing doubt on the statement of Diodorus, does not
note the testimony of Plato, Plutarch, and Porphyry; and in doubting
Pliny's story (*Hist. Nat.* xxxvi, § 4, 26 \[12\]) of an annual
sacrifice to Hercules he does not note Porphyry's account of the
sacrifice at Rhodes. See below, Part II, ch. i, § 4.

<span id="fn_251"></span>[65:3](pch20.htm#fr_251.md) Plutarch, *Cicero*,
10. Sallust (*Cat*. 22) expresses doubt; but on the point of probability
cp. Merimée, *Études sur l’histoire romaine*, 1844, ii, 113-116.

<span id="fn_252"></span>[65:4](pch20.htm#fr_252.md) Cp. Plutarch,
*Marcellus*, 3.

<span id="fn_253"></span>[65:5](pch20.htm#fr_253.md) Professor Huxley, in
his much over-pitched account of the monotheism and the ethic of the
Jews (discussed below), expressly ascribes the special development to "a
vigorous minority among the Babylonian Jews." Cp. I. Sack, *Die
altjüdische Religion im Uebergange vom Bibelthume zum Talmudismus*,
1889, pp. 25-27.

<span id="fn_254"></span>[65:6](pch20.htm#fr_254.md) Precisely here,
nevertheless, Dr. Jevons refuses to recognise progress, though the
establishment of monotheism is in terms of his own doctrine a great
progressive achievement. "Polytheism *may* in some few civilised peoples
rise towards pantheism, but in most cases degenerates into fetishism;
monotheism passes in one case from Judaism into Christianity, but in
another into Mohammedanism" (p. 395). This though Mohammedanism is by
far the stricter monotheism of the two, and though Mohammedanism
resisted magic and divination, which the Rabbis had maintained. (Cp.
Davies, *Magic, Divination, and Demonology*, pp. 41 *sq*., 64 Mohammed's
74-89). Dr. Jevons is here in company with Prof, Robertson Smith, who
argues that Mohammed's claim to have knowledge of a past historic
episode "by direct revelation," a claim never made by "the Bible
historians," is "to thinking minds one of the clearest proofs of
Mohammed's imposture" (*The Old Testament in the Jewish Church*, 2nd ed.
p. 141, *note*). What the Professor thought of the Hebrew claim to have
knowledge of *future* history by direct revelation is thus hard to
divine. Cp, p. 283, and p. 161, *note*.
