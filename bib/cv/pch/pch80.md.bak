#### § 6. Mexican Ethics.

The recital of these facts may load some to conclude that the

<span id="page_367">p. 367</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Mexican priesthood
must have been the most atrocious multitude of miscreants the world ever
saw. But that would be a complete misconception: they were as
conscientious a priesthood as history bears record of. The strangest
thing of all is that their frightful system of sacrifice was bound up
not only with a strict and ascetic sexual morality, but with an emphatic
humanitarian doctrine. If asceticism be virtue, they cultivated virtue
zealously. There was a Mexican Goddess of Love, and there was of course
plenty of vice; but nowhere could men win a higher reputation for
sanctity by living in celibacy. Their saints were numerous. They had
nearly all the formulas of Christian morality, so-called. The priests
themselves mostly lived in strict celibacy; <span
id="fr_1908"></span>[1](#fn_1908.md) and they educated children with the
greatest vigilance in their temple schools and higher colleges. <span
id="fr_1909"></span>[2](#fn_1909.md) They taught the people to be peaceful;
to bear injuries with meekness; to rely on God's mercy and not on their
own merits: they taught, like Jesus and the Pagans, that adultery could
be committed by the eyes and the heart; and above all they exhorted men
to feed the poor. The public hospitals were carefully attended to, at a
time when some Christian countries had none. They had the practice of
confession and absolution; and in the regular exhortation of the
confessor there was this formula: "Clothe the naked and feed the hungry,
whatever privations it may cost thee; for remember, their flesh is like
thine, and they are men like thee; cherish the sick, for they are the
image of God." And in that very same exhortation there was further urged
on the penitent the special duty of instantly *procuring a slave for
sacrifice to the deity*. <span id="fr_1910"></span>[3](#fn_1910.md)

Such phenomena carry far the challenge to conventional sociology. These
men, judged by religious standards, compare closely with our European
typical priesthood. They doubtless had the same temperamental qualities:
a strong irrational sense of duty; a hysterical habit of mind; a certain
spirit of self-sacrifice; at times a passion for asceticism; and a
feeling that sensuous indulgence was revolting. Devoid of moral science,
they had plenty of the blind instinct to do right. They devoutly did
what their religion told them; even as Catholic priests have devoutly
served the Inquisition. That is one of the central sociological lessons
of our subject. The religious element in man, being predominantly
emotional and traditional, may ally itself with either good or evil; and
no thanks are due to religion, properly speaking, if it is ever in any
degree identified with good.

<span id="page_368">p. 368</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> How comes it that
Christianity is not associated with human sacrifice while the Mexican
cultus was? Simply by reason of the different civilisations that went
before. It is civilisation that determines the tone of religion, and not
the other way. Christianity starts with a doctrine of one act of human
sacrifice; and Christians are specially invited each year at the sacred
season to fasten their minds on the details of that act. Their ritual
keeps up the mystic pretence of the act of ritual cannibalism which of
old went with the human sacrifice: they harp on the very words, "body
and blood." They mystically eat the body of the slain God. Now this very
act was performed by the Mexicans not only literally, as we have seen,
but in the symbolic way also; and they connected their sacraments with
the symbol of the cross.

Of the Tlascalans it is told that at one festival they fixed a prisoner
to a high cross and shot arrows at him; and that at another time they
fastened one to a low cross and killed him by bastinado. <span
id="fr_1911"></span>[1](#fn_1911.md) In the sacrifice of a maiden to the
Maize-Goddess Centeotl above mentioned, the priest who wore the slain
victim's skin stood with his arms stretched out, cross-wise, before the
image of Huitzilopochtli, so representing the Goddess; and the skin
(presumably stuffed) <span id="fr_1912"></span>[2](#fn_1912.md) was hung up
with the arms spread in the same attitude, and facing the street. <span
id="fr_1913"></span>[3](#fn_1913.md) The Mexicans, finally, had a festival
in honour of Xiuhteuctli, the God of Fire, <span
id="fr_1914"></span>[4](#fn_1914.md) the crowning act of which was the
making a dough image of the God (as was also done in the worship of
Huitzilopochtli at the festival called "Eating the God") and *raising it
on a cross*, <span id="fr_1915"></span>[5](#fn_1915.md) the image being
then climbed for and thrown down, and the fragments eagerly eaten by the
crowd as possessing a sacred efficacy. <span
id="fr_1916"></span>[6](#fn_1916.md) They felt they were brought into union
with the God in that fashion. As has been above noted, there is some
evidence that among the first Christians the Eucharist was sometimes a
baked dough image of a child: <span id="fr_1917"></span>[7](#fn_1917.md)
and on any view the irresistible

<span id="page_369">p. 369</span>

presumption is that in all cases alike the symbolical usage grew out of
a more ancient practice of ritual cannibalism. Christianity coming among
a set of civilised peoples, the symbol became more and more mystical,
though the priesthood adhered tenaciously to the doctrine of daily
mystical sacrifice. In Mexico, certain cults had similarly substituted
symbolism for actual sacrifice; among the modifying practices being the
drawing of a little blood from the ears and other parts of the children
of the aristocracy. <span id="fr_1918"></span>[1](#fn_1918.md) But the thin
end of the wedge was in, so to speak, in the survival of actual human
sacrifices; and the Aztec priesthood drove the wedge deeper and deeper,
in virtue of their collective economic interest as well as of what we
may term the master tendency of all religions—the fixation of ideas and
usages. The more piety the more priests; the more priests the more
sacrifices; and the constant wars of the Aztecs supplied an unfailing
stream of captives for immolation. <span
id="fr_1919"></span>[2](#fn_1919.md) Many wars were made for the sole
purpose of obtaining captives: <span id="fr_1920"></span>[3](#fn_1920.md)
in fact, the Aztec kings made a treaty with the neighbouring republic of
Tlascala and its confederates, a treaty which was faithfully kept, to
the effect that their armies should fight on a given ground at stated
seasons, in order that *both* sides should be able to supply themselves
with sacrificial victims. At all other times they were quite friendly;
and the Aztec kings avowedly kept up the relation purely in order to
have captives for sacrifice. <span id="fr_1921"></span>[4](#fn_1921.md) An
arrangement like that, once set up, would flourish more and more up to
the point of national exhaustion, especially as death in battle was
reckoned a sure passport to Paradise; and the priesthood would at the
same time grow ever more and more numerous, the only limit being the
people's power of endurance. There can be little doubt that the Aztec
empire would ultimately have broken down under its monstrous burden if
the Spaniards had not destroyed it; for the taxation necessary to
support the military and aristocratic system alongside of the allocation
of enormous untaxed domains <span id="fr_1922"></span>[5](#fn_1922.md) to
the ever-multiplying myriads of priests was becoming more insupportable
year by year, so that the deep disaffection of the common people was one
of the chief supports to the campaign of Cortès. <span
id="fr_1923"></span>[6](#fn_1923.md) It may well be that some of the
previous civilisations <span id="fr_1924"></span>[7](#fn_1924.md) had
succumbed in the same way, literally destroyed by religion, to the
extent, that is, of inviting conquest by less "civilised" tribes. Among
some of the Maya peoples, who preceded the Aztecs,

<span id="page_370">p. 370</span>

the office of sacrificer had come to be regarded as degraded; <span
id="fr_1925"></span>[1](#fn_1925.md) but even there the sacrifices never
ceased; and the Maya civilisation failed to hold its ground before the
others.

Strangely enough, there was current among the Aztecs themselves a belief
that their State was doomed to be overthrown. <span
id="fr_1926"></span>[2](#fn_1926.md) Here, doubtless, we have a clue to the
existence of civilising forces, and of a spirit of hostility to the
religion of bloodshed which, however, felt driven to express itself in
terms of despair. To this spirit of betterment, then, we turn with the
doubled interest of sympathy.

<span id="fn_1915"></span>[368:5](pch80.htm#fr_1915.md) There can be no
question as to the pre-Christian antiquity of the symbol of the cross in
Mexico as elsewhere. See Müller. pp. 496-500. The cross figured in
Mexico as a sacred symbol also in connection with the Rain-God, and was
expressly known as the "Tree of our life." Yet Dr. Brinton has
confidently decided (*Myths of the New World*, p. 96; *American Hero
Myths*, p. 155) that it simply signified, with its four points, the
cardinal points and the four winds. This explanation, which is a fair
guess, has been dogmatically put forward by several writers, including
Dr. Réville (*Lectures*, p. 38). But why should the cardinal points be
represented by an *upright* cross? And why should it be called "Tree of
our life" and specially associated with Tlaloc and other Gods of *rain?*
Were all four winds alike "rain-bringers"? Quetzalcoatl, as we shall
see, was God of one rain-bringing wind, and *his* mantle was marked with
crosses (Müller, p. 581. Cp. p. 500). Certainly the number four figured
in Tlaloc's worship (Bancroft, iii, 348), but so did the image of the
snake. Is not the more plausible hypothesis this, that in such a
connection the primary significance of the cross was phallic?
