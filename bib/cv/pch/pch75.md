### PART IV.

### THE RELIGIONS OF ANCIENT AMERICA

#### § 1. American Racial Origins.

<span class="smallcaps">In</span> the study of the native religions of
North and South America, there is a special attraction bound up with the
special perplexity of the subject. These religions, like the peoples
which have held them, seem to stand historically apart from the rest of
humanity, unrelated, underived, independent. The first question that
occurs to the ethnologist when he looks at the native American races is,
How and when did they get there? With which of the other human families
are they most nearly connected? In the present state of knowledge, we
still infer a "unity" in the human race, and decline to believe that
different human species were independently evolved from lower forms in
different continents, acquiring the same physical structure under widely
varying conditions. <span id="fr_1747"></span>[1](#fn_1747.md) The
suggestion to this effect by Waitz <span
id="fr_1748"></span>[2](#fn_1748.md) represents the state of speculation
before the bearings of the Darwinian theory had been realised. <span
id="fr_1749"></span>[3](#fn_1749.md)

It is therefore fitting that ethnologists should try to trace a
connection between the native races of America and the races of Asia,
which are the nearest to them in geographical position. Until that
hypothesis is either established or overthrown, our anthropology and our
moral science must remain in large part unsettled. It has been argued
that "we may safely leave to ethnologists the task of deciding whether
the whole human race descends from one original couple or from many;
for, spiritually speaking, humanity in any case is one. It is one same
spirit that animates it and is developed in it; and this, the
incontestable unity of our race, is likewise the only unity we need care
to insist on." <span id="fr_1750"></span>[4](#fn_1750.md) But this defines
rather the theological than the scientific attitude: for the very
question whether

<span id="page_340">p. 340</span>

an alleged spiritual unity is independent of a biological or
genealogical unity is one of the preliminary problems of true
"spiritual" science.

As we go into detail, we shall see some remarkable coincidences between
American and Asiatic and European and Polynesian religious systems; and
our conception of human nature must alter a good deal according as we
decide that certain peculiar superstitions and ritual practices were
reached alike by various races who grew separately out of pre-human
species, and these out of still lower species, in different parts of the
world, without intermixture; or decide that the whole of the man-like
family developed interconnectedly over one area, and that the different
races now existing did not branch off from the central stem till they
had already acquired what we call human characteristics—that is, until
they had reached the stage of speech, weapons, and fire, at which they
probably had "religion."

Suppose, for instance, that the American races came many thousands of
years ago from Asia, and that they are kindred to the earlier Asiatic
races: they would already have the germs of myths and a certain
religious bias in common with peoples whose descendants subsist in Asia;
and the coincidences in their religion would have to be pronounced
historical, that is, they would represent a sequence of phenomena
substantially determined by one original set of conditions within a
given area and territory. If, on the other hand, we suppose that
evolution proceeded in different parts of the planet and in widely
different environments on identical lines from the lowest forms of life
through many others, up to the anthropoid and the human, our whole
conception of evolutionary law is affected, and that in turn must affect
our philosophy. Looking inductively for evidence, we find what appear to
be clear traces of the existence of man in the Mississippi valley
between fifty and sixty thousand years ago, or perhaps even in the
"inter-glacial" period. Without deciding as to times, it would seem
certain that palæolithic man, whether by way of Behring Strait or of
Greenland and Labrador, peopled America from Asia or Western
Europe; <span id="fr_1751"></span>[1](#fn_1751.md) and there are some
grounds for inferring two distinct racial movements. <span
id="fr_1752"></span>[2](#fn_1752.md) But to whatever conclusions the
palæologist may come on that head, <span
id="fr_1753"></span>[3](#fn_1753.md) the original scientific and logical
veto on the hypothesis of

<span id="page_341">p. 341</span>

two or more independent evolutions of the human species must for the
present hold good.

However remote be the time of the first migration, then, we are shut up
to the assumption that the American races derive from Asia, either
directly or by way of Polynesia, <span id="fr_1754"></span>[1](#fn_1754.md)
since the alternative is a hypothesis of a human evolution from
pre-human forms in the New World, with the result of yielding an
identical human species, while the fauna and flora in general are
markedly different. As to the possibility of such an evolution in
America, Haeckel gives an emphatic negative. Putting the two hypotheses
of immigration from north-east Asia and from Polynesia, he adds: "In any
case the original inhabitants of America came from the Old World, and
are certainly not, as some suppose, evolved from American apes.
Catarrhine or small-nosed apes have at no period existed in
America." <span id="fr_1755"></span>[2](#fn_1755.md) The fact that men are
so much alike in the two hemispheres, while the animals are so widely
different, is a proof that the former are not autochthonous in
America. <span id="fr_1756"></span>[3](#fn_1756.md)

Nor is there any physical difficulty over the hypothesis that the
American races proceeded, by successive waves of emigration, from
Asia. <span id="fr_1757"></span>[4](#fn_1757.md) At Behring Strait Asia and
America are almost within sight of each other; and at one time they were
united. And if we suppose a migration of tribes like the Kamtskadals,
who easily bear extreme cold, being but slightly civilised, we dispose
of all such difficulties as the suggestion that pastoral Mongols would
never have crossed without some of their animals. Prescott, however,
remarks that "it would be easy for the inhabitant of Eastern Tartary or
Japan to steer his course from islet to islet, quite across to the
American shore, without being on the ocean more than two days at a
time"; <span id="fr_1758"></span>[5](#fn_1758.md) and this hypothesis is
open. <span id="fr_1759"></span>[6](#fn_1759.md) The question is one for
the exact solution of which we have not sufficient materials; and it
must be admitted that some ethnologists in the past came to their
conclusions

<span id="page_342">p. 342</span>

lightly. It has been said of Pickering, for instance, that he set up a
connection between the Malay and the Californian because each had an
open countenance, one wife, and no tomahawk. <span
id="fr_1760"></span>[1](#fn_1760.md) Happily we need not resort to such
inductions as these. Nor need we be deterred from the scientific search
by the fact that some of the guesses made have been wildly absurd. There
is said to be widely current in Peru a legend, fully believed by the
natives, that the name of the first Inca, Manco Capac, arose in the
actual advent of a shipwrecked Englishman, who got to be known as
*Ingasman*, and who married the daughter of one *Cocapac*, his son being
accordingly called *Ingasman Cocapac*, whence the name and title Inca
*Manco Capac*. <span id="fr_1761"></span>[2](#fn_1761.md) That is droll
enough; but we need not therefore proceed with Dr. Réville dogmatically
to decide that "*everything shows* that the civilisations of Mexico and
Peru are autochthonous, *springing from the soil itself*." <span
id="fr_1762"></span>[3](#fn_1762.md) If it be meant merely that the higher
forms of those civilisations (for there were many separate processes)
may have subsisted for many centuries without foreign influence, there
is no dispute; but the statement as it stands is an unwarranted
assertion of a separate human evolution from pre-human forms.

In the nature of the case, the primary separation of the American from
the Asiatic races being admittedly very remote, there are not many close
parallels to be expected. A number of extraordinary correspondences,
however, have been traced, which point to migrations posterior to the
Stone Ages. Take that, for instance, between the Aztec calendar signs
and the Mongolian zodiac. "The symbols in the Mongolian calendar are
borrowed from animals. Four of the twelve are the same as the Aztec.
Three others are as nearly the same as the different species of animals
in the two hemispheres would allow. The remaining five refer to no
creature then found in Anahuac. The resemblance went as far as it
could." <span id="fr_1763"></span>[4](#fn_1763.md) And no less remarkable
is the "analogy between the Mexican system of reckoning years by cycles
and that still in use over a great part of Asia," seeing that "this
complex arrangement answers no useful purpose, inasmuch

<span id="page_343">p. 343</span>

as mere counting by numbers, or by signs numbered in regular succession,
would have been a far better arrangement." <span
id="fr_1764"></span>[1](#fn_1764.md) Such a correspondence must be allowed
to count for much; and there is also a remarkable, though perhaps not a
conclusive, resemblance between the Aztec, pre-Aztec, and Peruvian
temple-pyramids and those of Mesopotamia, <span
id="fr_1765"></span>[2](#fn_1765.md) which derived from the earlier
Akkadians or Sumerians. Ruins of these still subsist in Central America
and Peru which can be compared with the records of those of Babylonia
and the one example at Saqqara in Egypt. <span
id="fr_1766"></span>[3](#fn_1766.md) Those temples or "mountain houses"
doubtless began as graves, and grew into great mounds of earth, like
those found in the Mississippi valley; <span
id="fr_1767"></span>[4](#fn_1767.md) and the Asiatic like the Mexican
pyramid was latterly one of several stages or terraces. <span
id="fr_1768"></span>[5](#fn_1768.md) Five seems to have been long a common
number in Asia, the Babylonian number seven being reached only at a late
period; <span id="fr_1769"></span>[6](#fn_1769.md) and five was the number
of stages or stories in the great temple of Huitzilopochtli, the Mexican
national God. <span id="fr_1770"></span>[7](#fn_1770.md) In the fact that
such pyramid temples, or tombs of the same type—the former often
carefully covered with masonry, and having likewise in some cases five
stages—are found in many of the South Sea Islands, <span
id="fr_1771"></span>[8](#fn_1771.md) we have a fresh reason for supposing
an ancient distribution of races eastwards from Asia, in repeated waves
of migration. <span id="fr_1772"></span>[9](#fn_1772.md) So, too, we are
entitled to surmise kinship, when we find that the Mexicans and some
Native American tribes <span id="fr_1773"></span>[10](#fn_1773.md) had a
fixed usage of throwing the first morsels of their meals into the
fire; <span id="fr_1774"></span>[11](#fn_1774.md) that something like this
is the practice of the islanders of

<span id="page_344">p. 344</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Lamotrek in the
Carolines <span id="fr_1775"></span>[1](#fn_1775.md) and those of Efate in
the New Hebrides; <span id="fr_1776"></span>[2](#fn_1776.md) and that many
Tungusian, Mongolian, and Turkish tribes persistently do the same thing
to this day; <span id="fr_1777"></span>[3](#fn_1777.md) and it is difficult
to believe that the peculiar usages of sacrificing a "messenger" or
"ambassador" to the Sun, painting him red, and hanging up his and other
victims’ skins, stuffed, as possessing a sacred efficacy, <span
id="fr_1778"></span>[4](#fn_1778.md) were independently evolved in the two
hemispheres. Even the practice of scalping seems to be peculiar to the
Native Americans and the kindred Polynesians, and, in a modified
form, <span id="fr_1779"></span>[5](#fn_1779.md) to the Mongols; <span
id="fr_1780"></span>[6](#fn_1780.md) and, as we shall see, the Mexicans,
like the ancient Semites and their Sumer-Akkadian teachers, passed their
children "through the fire" to the Fire-God. What is more significant,
they had the Semitic usage of making certain of their special
sacrificial observances last for five days. <span
id="fr_1781"></span>[7](#fn_1781.md)

There are remarkable concrete parallels, also, in the religious
practices and symbolisms of Asia and Mexico, apart from those which may
be taken as universal. Thus a stone or metal mirror was the symbol, and
the source of the name, of the Mexican God Tezcatlipoca; and it is also
the outstanding symbol in Japanese Shintoism, <span
id="fr_1782"></span>[8](#fn_1782.md) recognisably a very primitive Asiatic
cult. It is told, again, of the national God and War-God Huitzilopochtli
that, when the people came to Mexico from their home, his wooden image
with certain war-emblems was carried by four priests in an ark or chest,
called the Seat of God. Here we have a widespread usage; <span
id="fr_1783"></span>[9](#fn_1783.md) but it is significant that it is found
in some closely similar form among Mongols, Chinese, and Japanese. So
with the casting of children's horoscopes. <span
id="fr_1784"></span>[10](#fn_1784.md) More specific is the parallel between
certain Mexican usages and those of the Buddhist priests of Thibet and
Japan—such as red and yellow headdresses and black robes, <span
id="fr_1785"></span>[11](#fn_1785.md) which were in all likelihood
pre-Buddhistic. Singularly suggestive of Buddhist contacts, however, are
a number of Mexican sculptures: many figures of Quetzalcoatl are
practically identical with the established type of Buddha; and other
carvings show hardly less close parallels. <span
id="fr_1786"></span>[12](#fn_1786.md) But

<span id="page_345">p. 345</span>

no less significant of a general Asiatic connection, perhaps, is a
circumstance which has not been much considered by the ethnologists,
though it has been noted by the anthropologists—the fact, namely, that
both in ancient Asia and in ancient America men kept records by means of
knots in strings. <span id="fr_1787"></span>[1](#fn_1787.md) The Chinese in
old times are known to have done so; <span
id="fr_1788"></span>[2](#fn_1788.md) and it is told of he Dravidian Khonds
of Orissa that when brought to European knowledge sixty years ago they
"kept all accounts by knots on strings," and conceived of their Gods as
recording men's faults in the same fashion. <span
id="fr_1789"></span>[3](#fn_1789.md) This would seem to be exactly the
method of mnemonics used by the Peruvians when they were discovered by
the Spaniards, their *quipus* being described in the same terms; and
there is evidence that the same device was used in Central America, and
perhaps among the Tlascalans, though it had gone into disuse among the
Mexicans, who had attained to the use of "hieroglyphics." <span
id="fr_1790"></span>[4](#fn_1790.md)

There remains the question of the source and nature of those
hieroglyphics. To examine it in detail is beyond the scope of this
survey; and it must suffice to say that as the Mexican hieroglyphic
system proper represents an early stage in the evolution of writing from
pictures to phonetic symbols, with a phonetic system developed alongside
of it, <span id="fr_1791"></span>[5](#fn_1791.md) the phenomena are quite
consistent with the hypothesis of culture influences from Asia at a
remote period. It is not necessary to identify glyphs in order to infer
that the Chinese, Egyptian, and Aztec systems are akin. The Egyptian
symbols remained substantially undeveloped for at least two thousand
years; <span id="fr_1792"></span>[6](#fn_1792.md) and recent specialists
are satisfied that "many of the elements of hieroglyphic writing had
been growing upon the banks of the Nile long before the time of the
first historic dynasty." <span id="fr_1793"></span>[7](#fn_1793.md) Given
such a slow rate of growth, and noting the fact that Mexican and
Egyptian hieroglyphics, and Chinese script, are all written in columns,
we are provisionally entitled to see in all three the stages of a
continuous evolution. <span id="fr_1794"></span>[8](#fn_1794.md)

<span id="page_346">p. 346</span>

It is true that the American languages, while demonstrably akin to each
other, like the Indo-European group, show little or no relation to any
of the languages of Asia. But though the difficulty of fully proving
affinities of language between American and Asiatic races is great, and
we seem thus bound to suppose a very remote separation indeed; on the
other hand the extraordinary difference between the tongues of American
Indians of the same race <span id="fr_1795"></span>[1](#fn_1795.md) and the
observed facts as to the rapid changes of language among South Sea
islanders, when isolated from each other, go to suggest that very wide
deviation may occur in a few thousands of years among people of one
stock who have separated at a stage in which they have no literature,
and only the material beginnings of a ritual. Beyond this we need not
go. It suffices that there is no conceptual obstacle to the assumption
that the civilisation of pre-Christian America grew from the central
Asiatic roots which fed the beginnings of civilisation as we know it in
Mediterranean Asia and Europe; and that from the practical certainty of
an original migration of Asiatics to America there follows the
probability that there occurred several, at different stages of Asiatic
evolution. <span id="fr_1796"></span>[2](#fn_1796.md) The hypothesis which
seems best to meet all the facts is that America was first peopled from
Asia at an extremely remote period; that there slowly grew up American
races with a certain definite type of language; and that later
immigrants from Asia or Polynesia, perhaps coming as conquerors in
virtue of importing a higher civilisation, were linguistically absorbed
in the earlier mass, as conquering invaders have repeatedly been in the
known history of Europe. <span id="fr_1797"></span>[3](#fn_1797.md)

man evolved from the palæolithic to the neolithic stage in the region of

antiquity for man on the American continent as is revealed by the most
remote historical perspective of Egypt or Babylon" (p. 536)—the
implication being that *civilisation* was thus early developed. The
grounds offered for this proposition are certain parallels or identities
of popular games and accessories found among American and Asiatic races.
All of these data are Perfectly compatible with an Asiatic derivation of
the former. Mr. Culin's main principle appears to be a "patriotic"
desire to prove that "American culture" has not been "sterile."

Peruvian legend of Manco Capac and Mama Ocello with the known case of a
group of white men and women wrecked among the Kaffirs on the south-east
coast of Africa early in the eighteenth century, presumably does not
suppose the "Ingasman" theory to be probable. But the Peruvian story in

Peruvian myth.

like some in the Mississippi valley, though still terraced (see
Williams, as cited, p. 223; and Rev. J. B. Stair, *Old Samoa*, 1897, p.
227). Terraces, again, were a feature of the place on which used to be
consummated the sacrifice of the King of Calicut. Frazer, *Lect. on

Khond sacrifices. The Polynesians, too, have the Hindu myth of the eight
uncreated Gods, children of one Pair. Ellis, i, 325.

line of investigation that might be worth pursuing is suggested by the
resemblances of the Mexican use of colour to Chinese and Japanese
methods. There's also a curious similarity in the folding of Mexican and
Japanese books. Cp. Müller, p. 551.

99-100. Mr. Culin (as cited above) quotes Dr. Brinton as saying: "The
inner stronghold of those who defended the Asiatic origin of Mexican and
Central American civilisation is, I am well aware......the Mexican
calendar, the game of Patolli, and the presence of Asiatic jade in
America" (Paper "On various supposed relations between the American and
Asiatic races" read at the International Congress of Anthropology,
1893). It is odd that Dr. Brinton should see no force in the identity of
*quipus* and temple structures (both of which were noted by McCulloh as
early as 1816) and horoscopes.

doubt that America was populated in some way by people of an extremely
low culture at a period even geologically remote. There is no reason for
supposing, however, that immigration ceased with these original people"
(Dall, *Third Report of U.S. Bureau of Ethnology*, p. 146, cited by
Winsor, i, 76). Cp. Major J. W. Powell, "Whence came the American
Indians?" in *The Forum*, Feb. 1898, p. 688.

<span id="fn_1797"></span>[346:3](pch75.htm#fr_1797.md) Prof. A. H. Keane,
from whose generally negative verdict I dissent with due diffidence,
seems finally to admit (*Ethnology*, p. 345) the possibility of arrivals
in small number in the period of civilisation before Columbus.
