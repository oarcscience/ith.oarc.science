<p>All such doctrines, it is probable, were represented in the later, if not in the earlier, Babylonian religion; and the idea of the Logos is probably early in Mazdeism;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1117"></A><A HREF="#fn_1117"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> but in any case it was from the outside that it was pressed upon Judaism, to the extent, as we have seen,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1118"></A><A HREF="#fn_1118"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> of making a personality out of that Word of God which originally "came" to the prophets in the sense that his spirit was held to have entered into them. The whole evolution is noticeably parallel to that of the principles of law and government in States, from the stage in which the king or chief is judge and as such "God" to that in which he is surrounded by graded orders of priests and councillors, jurists and administrators. The Logos is in a manner the heavenly Grand Vizier.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1119"></A><A HREF="#fn_1119"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A></p>  
<p>It is impossible, however, to fix a date for the origin of the special dogma of the Logos. To take it as a Greek invention is to ignore the very problem of origins. An eminent Sanskritist assures us in one passage not only that the doctrine of the Logos is "exclusively Aryan," but that "whoever uses such words as <i>Logos</i>, the Word, <i>Monogen&ecirc;s</i>, the Only-begotten, <i>Prototokos</i>, the First-born, <i>Hyios tou theou</i>, the Son of God, has borrowed the very germs of his religious thoughts from Greek philosophy";&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1120"></A><A HREF="#fn_1120"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> while in another passage he admits that the conceptions of the Word as found in the Psalms&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1121"></A><A HREF="#fn_1121"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> and of the Angel as found in the Pentateuch "are purely Jewish, uninfluenced as yet by any Greek thought."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1122"></A><A HREF="#fn_1122"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A> Other eminent Sanskritists, again, have shown that the River-Goddess Sarasvat&icirc; is in the later Brahmanic mythology "identified with V&acirc;ch" or V&acirc;c [= Speech] "and becomes under different names the spouse of Brahma and the goddess of wisdom and eloquence, and is invoked as a Muse"; while in the Mah&acirc;bh&acirc;rata she is called the "mother of the Vedas."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1123"></A><A HREF="#fn_1123"><FONT SIZE="1">8</FONT></A> Elsewhere the personified V&acirc;ch enters into the</p>

<p>As among the Greeks and the Jews, so among the Hindus the doctrine of the sacred or creative Word is various. In the Satapatha Br&acirc;hmana, Prajapati (who is "composed of Seven Males") first of all things created the Veda, which became the foundation on which he "created the waters from the world in the form of speech. Speech belonged to him. It was created. It pervaded all this." In the same document the cosmic egg is the primordial source: "From it the Veda was first created&#151;the triple essence. Hence men say, 'the Veda is the first-born of this whole creation.....They say of a learned man that he is like Agni, for the Veda is Agni's mouth.'"&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1126"></A><A HREF="#fn_1126"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> The personified V&acirc;ch, Sarasvat&icirc;, River-Goddess and Goddess of Speech, is doubtless the later evolution,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1127"></A><A HREF="#fn_1127"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> just as is the Gr&aelig;co-Jewish <i>Sophia;</i> but there can be no question that the conception of the Veda as the Word, the first-created thing or first-born Being, is fully present in the Br&acirc;hmanas. In the Taittariya Br&acirc;hmana, "V&acirc;ch (speech) is an imperishable thing......the mother of the Vedas, and the centre point of immortality";&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1128"></A><A HREF="#fn_1128"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> being thus identified with Sarasvat&icirc; as aforesaid; but this does not affect the dogma, set forth by Sankara, that "from the eternal Word the world is produced."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1129"></A><A HREF="#fn_1129"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> Again, in the Satapatha Br&acirc;hmana "Speech is the Rig-Veda, mind the Yajur Vedah, breath the S&acirc;ma Veda."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1130"></A><A HREF="#fn_1130"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A> In the Taittariya, it is true, the Veda is created after the Soma;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1131"></A><A HREF="#fn_1131"><FONT SIZE="1">8</FONT></A> but such a variation, we shall see, occurs also in Jewish lore. And among the Vedantists, finally, "the 'word' (<i>sabda</i>) is 'God' (<i>Brahma</i>)."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1132"></A><A HREF="#fn_1132"><FONT SIZE="1">9</FONT></A> As regards, again, the more philosophical side of the <i>Logos</i> doctrine, the conception of an all-pervading and primordial Reason (Tao or Tau), we find it most explicitly and coherently set forth in China by Lao-Tsze, with a doctrine of a unity and trinity of forms of existence,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1133"></A><A HREF="#fn_1133"><FONT SIZE="1">10</FONT></A> in the sixth century before our era.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1134"></A><A HREF="#fn_1134"><FONT SIZE="1">11</FONT></A></p>  
<p>Are we then to suppose that such speculation originated with the Ionian Greeks, was passed on by them to the Jews, and by Jews or</p>

<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> Greeks or both to the Persians, and thence to the Brahmans and the Chinese? Such a hypothesis is visibly unmanageable. The Pythagorean derivation of Plato's doctrine of the Logos is tolerably clear; and its connection with the planetary lore of the eight heavenly powers, as well as with the lore of numbers and proportion,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1135"></A><A HREF="#fn_1135"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> tells of a source such as only the Chaldean or Egyptian schools of astrology and astronomy can be supposed to represent in the early Greek sphere. Babylonian religion contains the principle of the Logos in its most definite primary form, the doctrine of the Divine Name, which is the germ of the Platonic doctrine of ideas no less than of the Philonic and Johannine theology. We even find it in a form approximated-to in the Pentateuch (where the "name" of Yahweh is "in" the promised "Angel" leader),&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1136"></A><A HREF="#fn_1136"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> and made familiar later by the Jewish <i>Toledoth Jeschu</i> as well as by the modified Christian formula&#151;the teaching, namely, that the mystic name of the Supreme God is known to him alone, and is revealed by him solely to his son, who has thus virtually all power in heaven and on earth.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1137"></A><A HREF="#fn_1137"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A></p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px"><small>"This idea, which prevailed equally in Egypt and in Western Asia, is purely animistic. To pronounce a name is to call up and conjure the being who bears it. The name possesses personality...... To name a thing is to create it: that is why creation is often represented as accomplished by the word."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1138"></A><A HREF="#fn_1138"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A></small></div></p>  
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> Further, we know from Damascius&#151;whose list of Babylonian God-names is made good by the remains actually discovered in recent times&#151;that Tauth&ecirc;, Mother of the Gods, first bore a son, Moymis, who was "the intelligible world."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1139"></A><A HREF="#fn_1139"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> Here is the very formula of Philo. Of the God Nebo, too, who has so many attributes of the Logos, it is noted that his Akkadian prototype "was once the universe itself"&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1140"></A><A HREF="#fn_1140"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A>&#151;a likely source of such an identification in his case. If then the Jews had the Logos idea before their contact with the Greeks and the Mazdeans,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1141"></A><A HREF="#fn_1141"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A> the reasonable assumption is that they had it from a source from which the Mazdeans and Ionian Greeks could also have it&#151;the Babylonian lore, in which were accumulated the current fancies of thousands of years of Asiatic speculation, including that of the ancient civilisation from</p>

<p>which was derived that of the Chinese. And when we find the Brahmanic philosophy, like the Babylonian and Greek, making all things originate from a watery abyss,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1142"></A><A HREF="#fn_1142"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> and again from the cosmic egg,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1143"></A><A HREF="#fn_1143"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> we have at least cause to surmise that the Babylonian and Indian systems draw from one central source. It is true that the Indian lore seems best to combine the ideas of origination through the Word and through Water; and that the word <i>Saras</i> means not only Water but Voice, whence Sarasvat&icirc; = not only "the watery" but also "the vocal" or "the sounding."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1144"></A><A HREF="#fn_1144"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> Here, too, we seem to be in touch with primitive thought, for among the (perhaps partly Semitised) Yorubas of Nigeria there seems to have been a primary conception of moving water as the source of sound and of wisdom.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1145"></A><A HREF="#fn_1145"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> But while this is visibly more homogeneous than the late Hebrew evolution of a creative <i>Sophia</i> who equates with the creative <i>Logos</i> without any adaptation to the primordial abyss of waters (or "Ocean Stream" as in Homer) on which the "Spirit" had creatively moved, on the other hand the relative lateness&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1146"></A><A HREF="#fn_1146"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> of the evolution of V&acirc;ch and Sarasvat&icirc; leaves open the presumption that a foreign influence has been at work. Agni, also, the Fire-God, is finally identified with the Word; he too, in the Vedas, is the Son of the Water and messenger of the Gods;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1147"></A><A HREF="#fn_1147"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> and his worship connects visibly with the fire-worship not only of the Mazdeans but of the Babylonians, for whom also Gibil and Nusku (or Gibil-Nusku) the Fire-Gods are sons of the Creator, Gibil in particular being "the first-born of heaven (Anu) and the image of his father," while Ea, the Water-God, is the lord of life, and also the father of the Fire-God, who in turn is the messenger and counsellor of the Gods, clothed with their attributes.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1148"></A><A HREF="#fn_1148"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A> The blended characteristics of Sarasvat&icirc;, finally, are found in the Babylonian Goddess Sarpanitum, who, as finally blended with Erua, the daughter of Ea, was at once "lady of the deep," "voice of the deep," and "the possessor of knowledge concealed from men "attributes all deriving from the fact that "wisdom and the life-giving principle were two ideas associated in the Babylonian mind with</p>

<p>water."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1149"></A><A HREF="#fn_1149"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> In these various nations, surely, we have the true "germs" alike of the Hindu, the Heraklitean, and the Platonic concepts of the Word or Reason; of the conception of Hermes as Logos and Messenger of the Gods; of Apollo as his father's wisdom; of the Hindu, of the Hebrew, and of the Greek formulas of "First-born" and "Only-begotten"; and so alike of the later Judaic and the Christian theosophy.</p>  
<p>The further research is carried into the affiliation of the cults and creeds of Asia Minor and Syria, the more clearly does it appear that all relate to the great central mass of theosophy accumulated in Babylonia, which was still a culture force in the earlier centuries of the Christian era.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1150"></A><A HREF="#fn_1150"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> That system had inferribly given to the Christian Gnostics their astrology and magic; their doctrine of the immortality of souls (not bodies); their <i>Sophia;</i> their conception of a Saviour, Knowledge-Giver, and Mediator:&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1151"></A><A HREF="#fn_1151"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> it is sufficiently unlikely, then, that it had failed to evolve as did Brahmanism the concept of the Logos. The rational presumption is that it gave that concept to Greek and Jew alike.</p>  
<p>But the Jewish evolution was apparently piecemeal. Different ideas and doctrines, such as that of Metis, Thoth, Thoth-Khonsu, the combined <i>Logos</i> (Moon-God) and Sun-God;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1152"></A><A HREF="#fn_1152"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> Vohumano, the "Good Mind," combined with Mithra;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1153"></A><A HREF="#fn_1153"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> and the Platonic <i>Logos</i>, probably motived the separate evolution in Judaic literature of the personifications of <i>Sophia</i> or Wisdom,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1154"></A><A HREF="#fn_1154"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> the "Good Spirit,"&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1155"></A><A HREF="#fn_1155"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A> and the later <i>Logos</i>. In one book the <i>Logos</i> "leaps down from heaven out of the royal throne,"&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1156"></A><A HREF="#fn_1156"><FONT SIZE="1">8</FONT></A> and "as a fierce man of war" wields the divine command as a destructive sword;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1157"></A><A HREF="#fn_1157"><FONT SIZE="1">9</FONT></A> in another, <i>Sophia</i> is as distinctly personified: she "came out of the Most High," but he created her "from the beginning before the world," and she alone "encompassed the circuit of heaven."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1158"></A><A HREF="#fn_1158"><FONT SIZE="1">10</FONT></A> The writer means to be metaphorical, but for the many the effect must be graphic.

<p>this development took place and prepared for yet others, though Judaism was ostensibly bound to resist the multiplication of personalities thus set up, and was further predisposed to a male as against a female principle. In this respect, as in so many others, it exhibits its derivations from and affinities with savage thought, for among the Yorubas of Nigeria, in our own time, we find the primary conception, first, of the "natural" trinity of Father, Mother, and Son, with the general concept, behind that, of the Mother of All, who in time tends to be resolved into or superseded by a male;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1159"></A><A HREF="#fn_1159"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> perhaps as a result of the supersession of the matriarchate. Some such progression seems to have taken place among the Hebrews. The original "Holy Spirit," properly feminine, had in general been kept very much in the background, perhaps in fear of the old developments of goddess-worship, in which the symbol of the dove, taken by the Christists as standing for chastity, had really represented sexuality and fecundity.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1160"></A><A HREF="#fn_1160"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> But the mythop&#156;ic faculty, in its new forms of verbalism and pseudo-philosophy, was stronger than dogma, and stronger than fear. Accordingly we have Philo, at the traditional beginning of the Christian era, accumulating round the Logos the various aspects of the earlier Word and Sophia, and fitfully adding to them those of divine Sonship and Messiahship, and even the creative function of Demiourgos, thus at times reducing Yahweh to a somewhat remote abstraction.</p>
