#### § 4. Hebrews and Babylonians.

We must indeed guard against throwing on the side of Assyria and Babylon
the balance of prejudice which has so long been cast on the side of
Jewry. There can have been no more of general ethical or rational
elevation in the great polytheistic States than in the small. But it
lies on the face of the history of religion alike in India, Mesopotamia,
and Egypt, that in great and rich polytheistic priesthoods there arose
naturally a habit of pantheistic speculation <span
id="fr_285"></span>[1](#fn_285.md) which at least laid the basis for a
higher philosophy, science, and ethic; and it would be precisely the men
of such enlarged views in the great Mesopotamian capitals who would most
readily hold intercourse with the conquered or travelling Israelites.
Certain it is that the cosmogony of Genesis is adapted directly from
that preserved and partly developed in Mesopotamia from pre-Semitic
times. Thus the so-called genius of the Hebrews for religion founded
itself on the common Asiatic tradition of many thousands of years. <span
id="fr_286"></span>[2](#fn_286.md)

<span id="page_75">p. 75</span>

That the Hebrews should have learned anything worth learning from the
Babylonians is a notion for which most people are still unprepared by
education. <span id="fr_287"></span>[1](#fn_287.md) As it was put in the
last generation by one apologist: "The moral chasm which separates us
from heathens is so great that we can hardly realise their
feelings." <span id="fr_288"></span>[2](#fn_288.md) But when it is realised
that the Hebrews adopted the mythic cosmology of their neighbours <span
id="fr_289"></span>[3](#fn_289.md) it should be easier to conceive that
they got from them ideas of a more advanced order. <span
id="fr_290"></span>[4](#fn_290.md) And if the ethical tone of the "inchoate
monotheism" of the Hebrew books be thoughtfully noted, it will be
realised that only in the larger community was there any appreciable
chance for the development of a relatively enlightened creed.

There had there arisen perforce a measure of tolerance in virtue of the
very compulsion to polytheism. Early Assyria was as primitively tribal
as early Israel: Assur was at least as loudly vaunted and as devotedly
trusted as Yahweh; and his worshippers were presumptively not more but
less ready to accept other Gods, precisely because they were so much
more successful in their wars. Yet when by conquest city was added to
city, and kingdom to kingdom, a systematic polytheism was as inevitable
in Mesopotamia as in Egypt. There we see kings specially devoted to one
God; <span id="fr_291"></span>[5](#fn_291.md) but when one king's zeal
leads him to impose his cult on all, the outcome is the razing of his
own name, as well as his God's, from the monuments <span
id="fr_292"></span>[6](#fn_292.md) after his death. Whole populations could
not be driven out of one

<span id="page_76">p. 76</span>

worship into another; and as the sense of national unity arose, the
priesthoods of the capitals would more and more readily accept the Gods
of the outlying communities. The mere vicissitudes of warfare were
always a reason, in military eyes, for desiring to widen the field of
divine assistance; and no mere soldier or soldier-king could conceivably
doubt the existence of the Gods of his enemies, however he might in
battle affect to deride them. It was among the priests, or other
thoughtful men of leisure, that there would arise the inference that all
the God-names were but varying labels for one great non-tribal
Spirit, <span id="fr_293"></span>[1](#fn_293.md) who might be conceived
either (as among the Brahmans and Egyptians) pantheistically, or on the
lines of the relation of the earthly autocrat to the states he ruled.
And it was only through some such theorizing as this that any moral or
intellectual progress could be made; for only on this line could
monotheism become international. <span id="fr_294"></span>[2](#fn_294.md)

It is part of the convention aforesaid to treat the preservation of the
Hebrew creed as a gain to civilisation equal with that of the Greek
victory over the invading Persians: the heritage of Jewish monotheism,
it is assumed, is as precious as the heritage of Hellene literature,
philosophy, and art. <span id="fr_295"></span>[3](#fn_295.md) If, however,
there is to be any rational comparative appraisement of cults, it must
be in terms of their service either to ethics or to science, including
philosophy; and the service to ethics must finally be gauged in terms of
human happiness and freedom. Now, we have seen that in the last pages of
the Old Testament canon the religion of the Jews is tribal, trivial,
narrow; <span id="fr_296"></span>[4](#fn_296.md) and it is the historic
fact that to the day of the final fall of Jerusalem it remained
tribalist and localist; a gospel of racial privilege and a practice of
barbaric sacrifice; a law of taboo and punctilio, proclaiming a God of
ritual and ceremonial, dwelling unseen in a chosen house, with much
concern about its furniture and its commissariat. There is no ethical
principle in its whole literature that is not to be found in the
sacerdotal literatures of Egypt, Persia, India, or in the non-sacerdotal
literature of China and Greece. And with the Hebrew ethic there is
almost constantly bound up the ethic-destroying concept of the One God
as the patron of one people, who only through them consents to recognise
the rest of the human race.

<span id="page_77">p. 77</span>

It matters little whether, on the other hand, we think of the
pantheistic or monotheistic element in the Egyptian and other systems as
effective: <span id="fr_297"></span>[1](#fn_297.md) the question is whether
either polytheism or monotheism lifted morals and promoted science and
civilisation. Now, the polytheistic empires and the Hebrew State alike
failed to reach any principle of international reciprocity, so that on
that score they availed nothing against the fatal egoism of race; and as
regards moral reciprocity within the State, any discoverable difference
of code is rather in favour of the polytheists. <span
id="fr_298"></span>[2](#fn_298.md) The every-day code of the Egyptian
funerary ritual <span id="fr_299"></span>[3](#fn_299.md) supplies the main
practical ethic of the Gospels, and is closely echoed in the probably
non-Hebraic book of Job; <span id="fr_300"></span>[4](#fn_300.md) but while
a similar social spirit is incidentally met with in the psalms and the
prophets, the outstanding and emphasised ethic of the Hebrew historical
and prophetic books is really that national and regal righteousness
consist in worshipping the Hebrew God and renouncing the others, while
to worship them is to commit the sin of sins. The abstractly pietistic
sentiment of the Hebrew books, of which the most important element is
the sense of contrition, belongs to the psalmodic literature of the
Babylonians and the Egyptians alike; <span
id="fr_301"></span>[5](#fn_301.md) and all that is called by pietists
"cold" and "hard" and "materialistic" in other religious lore is
abundantly paralleled within the covers of the Bible.

 

In one respect, indeed, the Hebrew ethic is distinctly more refined than
that of the other creeds, that is to say, in its relation to the
principle of sex; but here, it is quite clear, the general elevation is
post-exilic, seeing that every form of sexual vice is

<span id="page_78">p. 78</span>

constantly asserted to have prevailed in and around the cult of Yahweh
before the Captivity. It thus appears that the Israelites either
acquired their purer ethic among the Babylonians, where an ideal of
purity certainly co-existed with a practice of sanctified licence, <span
id="fr_302"></span>[1](#fn_302.md) or developed such an ethic as the result
of the post-exilic struggle against the seductions and competition of
the neighbouring cults. And from this doctrinal evolution, finally,
there resulted, apart from the abolition of licentious worship as such,
no betterment of the position of women <span
id="fr_303"></span>[2](#fn_303.md) or the practice of men in Jewry as
compared with Greece and Rome. Not only did normal sexual vice subsist
as elsewhere, <span id="fr_304"></span>[3](#fn_304.md) but the Hebrew code
of divorce was iniquitous, and the law for the special punishment of
women offenders remained at least formally barbarous down to the
Christian era. <span id="fr_305"></span>[4](#fn_305.md)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_285"></span>[74:1](pch22.htm#fr_285.md) Cp. *Short History of
Freethought*, 2nd ed. i, 46, 48, 49, 53, 61-62, 70.

<span id="fn_286"></span>[74:2](pch22.htm#fr_286.md) Dr. Jevons does not
hesitate to assert (p. 265) that the resemblances between the Babylonian
and the Hebrew cosmological myths are "due to the human reason, which in
different places working on the same material comes to similar
inferences"—an untenable position. He adds that "The *difference* which
distinguishes the Hebrew from all other <span id="page_75">p. 75</span>
primitive narratives testifies that the religious spirit was *dealt* in
a larger measure to the Hebrews than to other peoples." Is brutish
ferocity the religious spirit? It appears to be implied that reason is
"dealt" in an absolutely equal degree to all peoples. Not a word in
specification of the alleged "difference" is vouchsafed; but on the next
page we read that the primitive science of those early narratives was
the work of the *human* reason, and proceeded from a *different source*
from that whence the religious elements in them came." In terms of Dr.
Jevons’s own definition of religion we must suppose that the Hebrew
Peculiarity he has in view is simply monotheism, though the plural term
Elohim gives the proof that for the Hebrews also polytheism was
primordial. Other hierologists again, such as Prof. Hommel (*Die
semitischen Völker and Sprachen*, 1881, i, 316) and Mr. Sayce (Hibbert
Lectures, pp. 314, 317), argue that some religious developments short of
monotheism can be explained only by the irruption of a new doctrine from
the outside, the former writer looking to the Hebrews and the latter to
Semites as against non-Semites. Both arguments are à priori, and lead
back to supernaturalism and revelation as against the principle of
evolution. Mr. Sayce, besides, is confuted by his own admissions, pp.
316, 320, 337, 339. H. Zimmern (*Babylonische Busspsalmen*, 1-2)
reasonably suggests that national misfortunes altered the religious tone
and temper. Cp. Sayce, p. 205, and Huxley's *Essays*, as cited below.

edition of these pages was being printed, the truth was newly insisted
on, with awakening force, by Professor Delitzsch at Berlin; and the
extensive discussion on *Babel und Bibel* which followed brought the
truth home to multitudes of readers.

<span id="fn_294"></span>[76:2](pch22.htm#fr_294.md) "Unless a monotheistic
conception of the universe is interpreted in an ethical sense.
monotheism (or monolatry) has no great superiority, either religiously
or philosophically, over polytheism" (Jastrow, p. 696).

on "The Evolution of Theology," in *Nineteenth Century*, April, 1886, p.

continues particularist" (Tiele, *Outlines*, p. 89).

<span id="fn_297"></span>[77:1](pch22.htm#fr_297.md) For the affirmative
view as to Egypt see Brugsch, *Religion and Mythologie der alten
Aegypter*, I. Hälfte, 1884, pp. 90-99. His many citations prove that
some at least of the Priests had a monotheistic philosophy. Cp. Le Page
Renouf, Hibbert Lectures, 2nd ed. pp. 215-216, 218-230; Tiele, *Egypt.
Rel.*, pp. 82, 152, 156-7, 216, 222. But, on the other hand, uniqueness
was predicated of many local Gods singly, and there was no universalist
*cult* popularly accepted as such. See the views of Maspero and others,
cited by Mr. Lang, *Myth, Ritual, and Religion*, 2nd. ed. ii, 111 sq.;
and compare Renouf (Hibbert Lectures, p. 230), who, however, puts it
that the Egyptian doctrines "*stopped short* in Pantheism."

<span id="fn_298"></span>[77:2](pch22.htm#fr_298.md) Huxley, after
asserting that the Hebrews "created the first consistent, remorseless,
naked monotheism which, so far as history records, appeared in the
world," affirms that "they inseparably united therewith an ethical code
which for its purity and for its efficiency as a bond of social life was
and is unsurpassed" (Essay cited, p. 501: *Essays*, iv, 363). Of these
propositions not an atom of proof is offered. In his eulogy of the Bible
as a school book, Huxley gave an equally gratuitous certificate to the
popular creed, with unfortunate results. Arnold's panegyric of Hebrew
ethics, which is equally uncritical, is not so surprising as coming from
him, being in keeping with his traditionist and æsthetic attitude; and
his naïveté made it more transparent. Cp. the author's *Modern
Humanists*, pp. 151-159.
