#### § 13. The Buddha Myth.

In the introduction to M. Senart's *Essai sur la légende de Buddha*, the
most comprehensive and scientific attempt of the kind yet made, the
central problem is thus posited:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Either the historical data are the primary nucleus
and as it were the central source, the legendary elements representing
an ulterior action, in part accessory, without necessary cohesion; or,
inversely, the mythological traits form a whole connected by a higher
and anterior unity with the personage on whom they are here grafted, the
historical data, if there are really any, being associated with them
only in virtue of a secondary adaptation. It is at the first point of
view that the inquiry has stood up to the present time. There has been
drawn the practical conclusion that it suffices to suppress all the
incredible details, what is left being taken for accredited history. I
seek to show that for this first point of view we ought decidedly to
substitute the second." <span id="fr_1290"></span>[1](#fn_1290.md)</span>

</div>

The conclusion to which the present argument points is exactly this,
adhered to, however, more strictly than is the case in M. Senart's
admirably learned treatise. For while he thus seems to imply that the
supernatural element is the beginning of Buddhism as such, he finally
assumes that there actually was a "founder." Certainly he sufficiently
attenuates his conception:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"A sect has a founder, Buddhism like every other. I
do not pretend to demonstrate that Sakyamuni never existed. The question
is perfectly distinct from the object of this treatise, It follows,
certainly, from the foregoing researches that hitherto the sacred
personage has been given too much historical consistence, that the
tissue of fables grouped around his name has been too facilely
transformed, by arbitrary piecings, into a species of more or less
unplausible history. Scepticism acquires from our analyses, in some
regards, a greater precision: still, it does not follow that we should
indefinitely extend its limits. In this epic and dogmatic biography,
indeed, there remain very few elements which sustain a close
examination; but to say this is not to say that among them there has not
entered some authentic reminiscence. The distinction is certainly very
difficult. Where we are not in a position to show for a tradition its
exact counterpart in other cycles, a decision is an extremely delicate
process. All that is suspicious ought not necessarily to be eliminated:
it is right that whatever is rigorously admissible ought to be retained.
There is no alleged deity—not Vishnu, or Krishna, or Herakles—for whom
we might not</span>

</div>

<span id="page_259">p. 259</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

construct a sufficiently reasonable biography by proceeding as has
hitherto been done in regard to the legend of Buddha.

"Under these reserves, I willingly recognise that there remain a certain
number of elements which we have no absolute reason for thinking
apocryphal: they may represent real historical reminiscences: to that,
for my part, I have no objection. It is possible that the founder of
Buddhism may have come from a tribe of Sakyas, though the pretended
history of that race is certainly quite fictitious. It is possible that
he may have come of a royal line, that he may have been born in a city
called Kapilavastu, though this name arouses grave suspicions, opening
the door to either mythological or allegorical interpretations, and the
existence of such a town is very feebly certified. The name Gotama is
certainly historic and well-known, but it is a borrowed name which tells
us little. Much trouble has been taken to explain how this strictly
Brahmanic patronymic might have passed to a family of Kshatriyas \[the
warrior caste\] . Apart from Buddha, it is above all closely associated
with his supposed aunt, the legendary Prajápati......I do not speak of
his genealogy: it has certainly no value, being borrowed whole from epic
heroes, in particular from Rama. On the other hand, it may well be that
the teacher of the Buddhists entered on his religious career at the age
of thirty-nine <span id="fr_1291"></span>[1](#fn_1291.md)......"

</div>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> And so on. Let us
pause at the last clause to remember how the Jesus of the gospels "began
to be about thirty years of age" when he began *his* teaching career,
and to ask on what rational ground we can suppose such a detail to have
been biographically preserved when the surrounding narrative yields no
sign of biography whatever? There is in fact no single detail in the
legend that has any claim to critical acceptance; and the position of
the latest conservatives, as Oldenberg, is finally only a general
*petitio principii*. India, admits that candid scholar, always was, as
it is, "a land of types," wherein the lack of freedom stunts the free
growth of individuality; and in the portraits of the Buddha and all his
leading disciples we have simply the same type repeated. Yet, he
contends, "a figure such as his certainly has not been fundamentally
misconceived (*fundamental missverstanden worden ist eine Gestalt wie
die seine gewiss nicht*)." <span id="fr_1292"></span>[2](#fn_1292.md)
Critical logic will not permit such an A, priori reinstatement of a
conception in which every element has given way before analysis. It is
but an unconscious resort to the old fallacy of meeting the indictment
of a spurious document with the formula, "Who else could have written
it?" <span id="fr_1293"></span>[3](#fn_1293.md)

<span id="page_260">p. 260</span>

We recur to the old issue—the thesis that "every sect must have had a
founder." Such was the unhesitating assumption of Minayeff, who did so
much to bring historic clearness into early Buddhist history. "It is
beyond doubt that at the origin of great historic movements always and
everywhere appear important and historic personalities. It was so,
certainly, in the history of Buddhism, and its development
unquestionably commenced in the work of the founder." <span
id="fr_1294"></span>[1](#fn_1294.md) Here we have something more than the
proposition of M. Senart—we have a doctrine which would ascribe to
definite founders the cults of Herakles and Dionysos and Aphroditê, the
worship of fire, and the institution of human sacrifice. Dismissing such
a generalisation as the extravagance of a scholar without
sociology, <span id="fr_1295"></span>[2](#fn_1295.md) we bring the issue to
a point in the formula of M. Senart. Plainly that is significant in the
sense only that someone must have begun the formation of any given
group. It is clearly not true in the sense that every sect originates in
the new teaching of a remarkable personage. And we have seen reason to
infer that there was a group of heretical or deviating Brahmanists, for
whom "a Buddha" was "an enlightened one," one of many, before the
quasi-historical Buddha had even so far emerged into personality as the
slain Jesus of the Pauline epistles. Brahmanic doctrine, Brahmanic
asceticism and vows, and Brahmanic mendicancy—these are the foundations
of the Order: the personal giver of that rule and teaching, the Teaching
God, comes later, even as the Jesus who institutes the Holy Supper comes
after the eucharist is an established rite. Every critical scholar,
without exception, admits that a vast amount of doctrine ascribed to
Buddha was concocted long after his alleged period. It cannot then be
proved that any part of the doctrine is not a fictitious ascription; and
there is not a single tenable test whereby any can be discriminated as
genuine. In the words of Kuenen, "we are not free to explain Buddhism
from the person of the founder." <span id="fr_1296"></span>[3](#fn_1296.md)
Nor is there any more psychological difficulty in supposing the whole to
be doctrinal myth than in conceiving how the later Brahmanists could put
their discourses in the mouth of Krishna.

The recent attempts to establish the historicity of Gotama Buddha by
excavated tomb-remains <span id="fr_1297"></span>[4](#fn_1297.md)—a kind of
evidence which obviously could prove nothing as to the achievements or
teaching

<span id="page_261">p. 261</span>

of the person interred—have broken down on their merits. Dr. Fleet's
claim to date an inscribed vase before Asoka's time on the strength of
its letter-forms is peremptorily rejected; <span
id="fr_1298"></span>[1](#fn_1298.md) and Professor Davids’ theory that the
remains found under one *stupa* are those of Buddha has to compete with
the theory of Dr. Fleet that they are those of *massacred* Buddhana
Sakiya = "kinsmen of Buddha," which in turn is rejected by M. Barth as
an impossible interpretation. On such lines there can be no
establishment of any relevant historic facts; and we are left to the
decision that "No extant inscription, either in the north or south, can
be referred with confidence to a date earlier than that of Asoka. <span
id="fr_1299"></span>[2](#fn_1299.md)

Professor Kern, coming to conclusions substantially identical with those
of M. Senart, posits for us finally an ancient Order of monks, absorbing
an ancient popular religion, and developing for people of the middle and
lower classes the ideals of a spiritual life current in the schools of
the Brahmans and the ascetics. "It is very possible," he goes on, "that
the Order had been founded—whatever be the precise sense which we attach
to that word—by a single man peculiarly gifted, even as, for example, it
is possible that Freemasonry may have been so founded. We may even, by
an effort of imagination, adorn this founder with all sorts of good
qualities; but we have no right to say that the amiability of the Buddha
of the legend has any other origin than the antique belief according to
which the Buddha, in his quality of cherishing sun, is *manno
miltisto*" <span id="fr_1300"></span>[3](#fn_1300.md)—the kindest of men,
in the words applied by an old German prayer-chant to the deity.

This is the warranted attitude of scientific criticism; and the mere
"may-be" as to the possible Founder is exclusive of any Evemeristic
solution. M. Senart's necessary founder, and Professor Kern's possible
founder, are wholly remote from the Buddha alike of the Buddhist and of
the rationalising scholar, bent on saving a personality out of a myth.
On the face of the case, there is a presumption that, while there may
easily have been, "about 500 B.C., a man who by his wisdom and his
devotion to the spiritual interests of his kind made such an impression
that contemporaries compared him to a pre-existing ideal of wisdom and
goodness, and that posterity completely identified him with this
ideal," <span id="fr_1301"></span>[4](#fn_1301.md) the Order was not
founded by any such person. No Buddha made the Buddhists—the Buddhists
made the Buddha. <span id="fr_1302"></span>[5](#fn_1302.md)

<span id="page_262">p. 262</span>

An obviously sufficient conceptual nucleus for "the" Buddha lay in the
admittedly general Brahmanic notion of "Buddhas." There is even a
tradition that at the time when Sakyamuni came many men ran through the
world saying "I am Buddha! I am Buddha!" <span
id="fr_1303"></span>[1](#fn_1303.md) This may be either a Buddhist way of
putting aside the claims of other Buddhas or a simple avowal of their
commonness. But a real Buddha would be a much less likely "founder" than
one found solely in tradition. Any fabulous Buddha as such could figure
for any group as its founder to begin with: to him would be ascribed the
common ethical code and rules of the group: the clothing of the phantom
with the mythic history of Vishnu-Purusha or Krishna, the "Bhagavat" of
earlier creeds, followed as a matter of course, on the usual lines. M.
Senart "holds it for established that the legend as a whole was fixed as
early as the time of Asoka." <span id="fr_1304"></span>[2](#fn_1304.md)
Some of the latest surveys of the problem end in an inference that the
oldest elements in the legend consist of fragments of an ancient poem or
poems embedded in the Pitakas. <span id="fr_1305"></span>[3](#fn_1305.md)
The quasi-biographical colour further given to mythical details is on
all fours with that of the legends of Joseph, Moses, Joshua, and Jesus,
all late products of secondary mythology, in periods which
systematically reduced God-legends to the biographic level. As we have
seen, the fabrication of narrative-frames for the teachings ascribed to
the Buddha was early an established Buddhist exercise. And this
accumulation of quasi-biographical detail, as we have also seen, goes on
long after the whole cycle of prior supernaturalist myth has been
embodied. It is after Jesus has been deified that he is provided with a
mother and a putative father and brothers; and it is in the latest
gospel of all that we have some of the most circumstantial details of
his life and deportment. There is even a case for the thesis that some
of the characteristics of the Buddha are derived from sculptures which
followed Greek models. <span id="fr_1306"></span>[4](#fn_1306.md)

On these grounds, then, it is here submitted that the traditional figure
of the Buddha, in its most plausibly rationalised form, is as unhistoric
as the figure of the Gospel Jesus has been separately shown to be. Each
figure simply stands for the mythopœic action of the religious mind in a
period in which Primary-God-making had given way to
Secondary-God-making, and in particular to the craving for a Teaching
God who should originate religious and moral ideas

<span id="page_263">p. 263</span>

as the other Gods had been held to originate agriculture, art, medicine,
normal law, and civilisation. And if by many the thought be still found
disenchanting, they might do well to reflect that there is a side to the
conception that is not devoid of comfort.

Buddhism, like Christianity, is from the point of view of its
traditional origins a "failure." Buddhism, indeed, notably in the case
of Burmah, has done more to mould the life of a whole people towards its
ostensibly highest ethic than Christianity ever did; but Buddhism, being
at best a gospel of monasticism, quietism, and mechanical routine,
collapsed utterly in India, the land of its rise; and its normal
practice savours little of moral or intellectual superiority to any of
the creeds around it. <span id="fr_1307"></span>[1](#fn_1307.md)
Brahmanism, which seems to have ultimately wrought its overthrow, set up
in its place a revived and developed popular polytheism, on the plane of
the most ignorant demotic life. Christianity, in turn, professedly the
religion of peace and love, is as a system utterly without influence in
suppressing war, or inter-racial malignity, or even social division. The
vital curative forces as against those evils are visibly independent of
Christianity. And here emerges the element of comfort.

On our Naturalistic view of the rise of the religions of the Secondary
or Teaching Gods, it is sheer human aspiration that has shaped all the
Christs and all their doctrines; and one of the very causes of the total
miscarriage is just that persistence in crediting the human aspiration
to Gods and Demigods, and representing as superhuman oracles the words
of human reason. Unobtrusive men took that course hoping for the best,
seeking a short cut to moral influence; but they erred grievously. So to
disguise and denaturalise wise thoughts and humane principles was to
keep undeveloped the very reasoning faculty which could best appreciate
them. Men taught to bow ethically to a Divine Teacher are not taught
ethically to think: any aspiration so evoked in them is factitious,
vestural, verbal, or at best emotionally superinduced, not reached by
authentic thought and experience. When, haply, the nameless thinkers who
in all ages have realised and distilled the wisdom or unwisdom given out
as divine are recognised in their work for what they were, and their
successors succeed in persuading the many to realise for them- selves
the humanness of all doctrine, the nations may perchance become capable
of working out for themselves better gospels than the best of those
which turned to naught in their hands while they held them as
revelations from the skies.
