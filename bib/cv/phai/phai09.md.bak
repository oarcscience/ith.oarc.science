# II. HISTORY OF TRADITION.

<span id="page_170">p. 170</span> <span id="page_171">p. 171</span>

### CHAPTER VI.

### *CHRONICLES*.

<span class="smallcaps">Under</span> the influence of the spirit of each
successive age, traditions originally derived from one source were very
variously apprehended and shaped; one way in the ninth and eighth
centuries, another way in the seventh and sixth, and yet another in the
fifth and fourth. Now, the strata of the tradition show the same
arrangement as do those of the legislation. And here it makes no
difference whether the tradition be legendary or historical, whether it
relates to pre-historic or to historic times; the change in the
prevailing ideas shows itself equally in either case. To show the truth
of this in the case of the Hexateuch is of course our primary object,
but we make our commencement rather with the properly historical books.
For on various grounds we are here able with greater certainty to
assert: Such was the aspect of history at this period and such at that;
such were the influences that had the ascendancy at one time, and such
those which prevailed at another.

We begin the inquiry where the matter is clearest—namely, with the Book
of Chronicles. Chronicles, which properly speaking forms but a single
book along with Ezra and Nehemiah, is a second history running parallel
with the Books of Samuel and Kings, and we are here in the favourable
position of starting with the objects of comparison distinctly defined,
instead of having as usual to begin by a critical separation of sources
of various age combined in one document. And, what is more, we can also
date the rival histories with tolerable certainty. The Books of Samuel
and of Kings were edited in the Babylonian exile; Chronicles, on the
other hand, was composed fully three hundred years later, after the
downfall of the Persian empire, out of the very midst of fully developed
Judaism. We shall now proceed to show that the mere difference of date
fully accounts for the varying ways in which the two histories represent
the same facts and events, and the difference of spirit arises from the
influence of the Priestly Code

<span id="page_172">p. 172</span>

which came into existence in the interval. De Wette's "Critical Essay on
the Credibility of the Books of Chronicles" (*Beiträge*, i.; 1806), is
throughout taken as the basis of the discussion: that essay has not been
improved on by Graf (*Gesch. Bücher d. A. T.* p. 114 seq.), for here the
difficulty, better grappled with by the former, is not to collect the
details of evidence, but so to shape the superabundant material as to
convey a right total impression.

#### I.

1\. After Jehovah had slain Saul (so begins the narrative of
Chronicles), He turned the kingdom unto David the son of Jesse. All
Israel gathered themselves unto David to Hebron and anointed him king
over Israel, according to the word of Jehovah by Samuel (1 Chron. x.
1.-xi. 3). How simply and smoothly and wholly without human intervention
according to this version did the thing come to pass! Quite otherwise is
it in the narrative of the Book of Samuel. This also indeed has the
statement of Chronicles word for word, but it has something over and
above which gives a quite different aspect to the matter. Here David, on
the lowest step to the throne, is the guerilla leader in the wilderness
of Judah who finally is compelled by Saul's persecutions to pass over to
Philistine territory, there under the protection of the enemies of his
nation, carrying on his freebooter life. After the battle of Gilboa he
avails himself of the dissolution of the kingdom to set up a separate
principality in the south as a vassal of the Philistines; he is not
chosen, but comes with a following six hundred strong, and offers
himself to the elders of Judah, whom he has already at an earlier period
laid under obligations to him by various favours and gifts. In the
meantime Saul's cousin Abner takes over what of the kingdom there is,
not for himself but for the legitimate heir Ishbaal; from Gilead,
whither the government had been transferred after the great catastrophe,
he gradually reconquers the territory west of Jordan, and is scheming
how to recover also the lost Judah. Thus it comes to protracted
struggles between Abner and David, in which fortune is most on the side
of the latter; yet he does not leave the defensive or gain the
sovereignty over Israel. That falls into his hands rather by treachery.
Abner himself, indignant at the ingratitude of his royal nephew, offers
the crown to his rival, and enters into negotiations with

<span id="page_173">p. 173</span>

him about it; but as he immediately afterwards falls a victim to blood
revenge, nothing comes of the matter until Ishbaal is privily murdered
in his sleep by two of his captains; then at last the elders of Israel
come to Hebron, and David becomes king in succession to Saul. What a
length of time these affairs demand, how natural is their development,
how many human elements mingle in their course,—cunning, and treachery,
and battle, and murder! Chronicles indeed knows them all well enough, as
is clear from incidental expressions in chaps. xi. and xii., but they
are passed over in silence. Immediately after his predecessor's death
the son of Jesse is freely chosen by all Israel to be king, according to
the word of Jehovah by Samuel. The sequence of x. 13, 14, xi. 1 does not
admit of being understood in any other way, nor is it in point of fact
otherwise understood, for it has actually been successful, at least to
this extent, that the kingship of Ishbaal has virtually dropped out of
traditional Bible history; after Saul came David is what is said. We
have before us a deliberate and in its motives a very transparent
mutilation of the original narrative as preserved for us in the Book of
Samuel.

As all Israel has made David the successor of Saul, and all Israel gone
out with him to the conquest of Jerusalem (xi. 4),—in 2 Sam. v. 6 we
hear only of David's following,—so now immediately afterwards, the
noblest representatives of all the tribes of Israel, who even before he
had attained the throne were in sympathy and indeed already on his side,
are enumerated by name and numbers in three lists (xi. 10-xii. 40),
which are introduced between what is said in 2 Sam. v. 1-1110 and in 2
Sam. v. 11 seq. The first (xi. 10-47: "these are the mighty men who took
part with him with all Israel to make him king") is the list of 2 Sam.
xxiii., which the Chronicler, as he betrays in chaps. xx., xxi., was
acquainted with as it stood in that place, and here gives much too
early, for it is for the most part warriors of David's later campaigns
who are enumerated. <span id="fr_109"></span>[1](#fn_109.md) The second
list (xii. 1-22: "these are they that came to David to Ziklag, while he
yet kept himself close because of Saul") is not taken from the Book of
Samuel, but one also

<span id="page_174">p. 174</span>

observes this difference: along with old and genuine there are extremely
common names, and hardly one that occurs here only; the notes of
ancestry carefully given in chap. xi. are almost always wanting; and
instead of performing before our eyes such deeds as the rescue of a
field of barley from the enemy, the purchase of a draught of water with
blood, the slaying of a lion in a pit, the heroes receive all sorts of
*epitheta ornantia* (xii. 1-3) and titles of honour (xii. 14, 20), and
ordinarily talk a highly spiritual language (xii. 17, 18). And as for
the historical situation, how impossible that a great Israelite army
should have been gathered around David as the feudatory of the
Philistines in Ziklag (xii. 22), with a crowd of captains of hundreds
and thousands! Plainly the banished fugitive is according to this
representation the splendid king and illustrious ancestor of the
established dynasty; hence also the naive remark of ver. 29. No better
is it with the third list (xii. 23-40: "these are the numbers of the
bands, ready armed for the war, who came to David to Hebron"). Observe
the regular enumeration of the twelve tribes, which nowhere occurs in
the older historical books, and is quite artificial; then the vast
numbers, which are not matters of indifference here, but the principal
thing and make up the entire contents; finally, the 4600 Levites and
3700 priests, who also take their place in the martial train, and
constitute the proper guard of the king; to Chronicles the distinction
between secular and spiritual soldiers is not altogether clear. There
are but a few details of a special kind; the remark in xii. 32 is
perhaps connected with 2 Sam. xx. 18; Jehoiada the prince of the house
of Aaron, *i.e.*, the high priest, alongside of the historically certain
series,—Eli, Phinehas, Ahitub, Ahiah (Ahimelech), Abiathar,—an utterly
impossible person, is a reflection of the Jehoiada of 2 Kings xi., xii.,
and the allegation that Zadok at that time joined David at the head of
twenty-two chief priests is a hardly credible substitute for what is
stated in Samuel, according to which Abiathar, whose older claims were
disagreeable to the B’ne Zadok and those who came later, was the priest
who from the beginning held with David; the twenty-two chief priests
appear to correspond to the heads of the twenty-two post-exilian
priestly families (Neh. xii. 1-7, 12-21, x. 3-9; 1 Chron. xxiv. 7-18).
Yet it is hardly necessary to go so minutely into the contents of the
above lists, for the purpose with which they are given is stated without
circumlocution at the close (2 Chron. xii. 38, 39): "All these men of
war, in order of battle, came with a perfect heart to Hebron to make
David

<span id="page_175">p. 175</span>

king over all Israel, and all the rest of Israel also were of one heart
to make David king. And they were there with David three days, eating
and drinking, for there was joy in Israel."

After the explication of the idea "all Israel" thus inappropriately
interpolated, the narrative proceeds to reproduce the contents of 2
Samuel v.-vii. David's first deed, after the conquest of the stronghold
of Jebus, is in Chronicles to make it the holy city by transferring the
ark of Jehovah thither (xiii. 1 seq.). It seems as if the building of a
palace and the Philistine war (2 Sam. v. 11-25) were to be omitted; but
after the narrative in 2 Samuel vi. 1 seq. has been given down to the
place "and the ark of Jehovah abode in the house of Obed-edom three
months" (1 Chron. xiii. 14 = 2 Sam. vi. 11), the pause of a quarter of a
year is utilised for the purpose of overtaking what had been left out
(xiv. 1-17 = 2 Sam. v. 11-25), and then the history of the ark is
completed. This indeed is to separate things mutually connected, but at
the same time the secular business which, according to the older
narrative, is the nearest and most pressing, is reduced to the level of
a mere episode in the midst of the sacred. That there is no room for the
building of a house and a Philistine war within the three months which
offer themselves so conveniently for the interpolation is a subordinate
affair.

As regards the sacred business, the transference of the ark to Zion,
almost everything that is said in 2 Samuel vi. is repeated word for word
in Chronicles also (xiii., xv., xvi., xvii. 1). Two traits only are
absent in Chronicles, and in neither case is the omission helpful to the
connection David's wife Michal, it is said in 2 Sam. vi. 16, 20-23, when
she saw the king dancing and leaping in the procession, despised him in
her heart; afterwards when he came home she told him what she thought of
his unworthy conduct. The first of these two statements is found in
Chronicles also (xv. 29), but the second is (all but the introductory
notice, xvi. 43 = 2 Sam. vi. 20, here torn from its connection) omitted,
although it contains the principal fact, for the historical event was
the *expression* of her contempt, not its psychological origin; a
woman—such is the idea—must not say a thing like that to David. The
other case is quite similar. On account of the calamity by which those
who were bringing up the ark were overtaken, David does not at first
venture to receive it into his citadel, but deposits it in the house of
Obed-edom, one of his captains; but when Jehovah blesses the

<span id="page_176">p. 176</span>

house of Obed-edom, he takes courage to bring the ark to his own home (2
Sam. vi. 10-12). Chronicles also tells that Jehovah blessed the house of
Obed-edom (xiii. 14), but mentions no consequent result; again the cause
is given without the effect. Another explanation is substituted; David
perceived that the disaster connected with the removal of the ark was
due to the fact of its not having been carried by the Levites in
accordance with the Law; the Levites accordingly were made to bear it
and no harm ensued (xv. 2, 13-15). This is in complete and manifest
contradiction to the older narrative, and as Chronicles (chapter xiii.)
copies that narrative, it also contradicts itself (xiii. 10), and that
all the more strikingly as by the addition in xiii. 2 it represents the
accompanying clergy as tacitly approving the carrying of the ark on the
ox-cart. Then due participation in the sacred procession having been
thus once secured them, 1 Chron. xv. positively revels in priests and
Levites, of whom not a sing\]e word is to be found in 2 Sam. vi., and
moreover a sort of musical service is instituted by David himself before
the ark, and a festal cantata made up by him out of post-exilian psalms
is quoted (chapter xvi.). In this way, out of the original narrative,
the scattered fragments of which now show themselves very strangely in
the new connection, something quite different has grown. "In the former
everything is free, simply the affair of king and people, here all is
priestly ceremonial; there the people with their king shout and dance
with joy before the ark, here the Levites are the musicians and singers
in formal order. To seek to combine the two versions is wholly against
the laws of historical interpretation. If the first were curt and
condensed the unification of the two might perhaps be possible, but no
story could be more particular or graphic, and could it have been that
the Levites alone should be passed over in silence if they had played so
very important a part? The author of Chronicles was able to introduce
them only by distorting and mutilating his original and landing himself
in contradiction after all. He cannot allow anything to happen without
Levites; and was the ark of the covenant to be fetched to Jerusalem
without them? was the Law to be even a second time broken under the
pious king David? This seemed to him impossible. That Uzzah perished in
the first attempt to fetch the ark, and that on the second occasion—when
only a quite short journey is spoken of—the ark was carried, 2 Sam. vi.
13, may have been the suggestions by which he was led. Fertile

<span id="page_177">p. 177</span>

in combinations, he profited by the hint." So, justly, De Wette
(*Beiträge*, i. 88-91).

The narrative of 2 Sam. vi. having been broken off at the first half of
ver. 19 (1 Chron. xvi. 3), the second half of the verse and the
beginning of the next are reproduced (xvi. 43) after the interpolation
of xvi. 4-42, and then 2 Sam. vii. is appended word for word (1 Chron.
xvii.),—the resolution of David to build a house for the ark, and what
Jehovah said to him about the subject through Nathan. The point of the
prophet's address turns on the antithesis (2 Sam. vii.). "Thou wilt
build a house *for me?* rather will I build a house *for thee;*" the
house of David is of course the Davidic dynasty. But an interpolation
has already crept into the text of Samuel (vii. 13), which apprehends
the antithesis thus: "*Thou* wilt build a house for me? Nay, *thy son*
shall build a house for me." Now Chronicles, for which David comes into
consideration merely as the proper founder of the Solomonic temple,
takes up the narrative of 2 Sam. vii. precisely on account of this
interpolation, as is clear from xxii. 9, 10—increases the
misunderstanding by going back to it in an addition (xvii. 14)—and at
the outset destroys the original antithesis by the innocent alteration,
"Thou shalt not build *the house* for me" instead of "Wilt thou build
*a* house for me? "*The house* can here mean only that imperatively
needed one, long kept in view alike by God and men, which must by all
means he built, only not by David but by Solomon; it is without any
ambiguity the temple, and does not, like *a house*, contain that
possibility of a double meaning on which the original point depends. It
is interesting also to compare 2 Sam. vii. 14 with 1 Chron. xvii. 13: "I
will be to thy seed a father, and he shall be to me a son. *If he commit
iniquity, then I will chasten him with the rod of men, and with the
stripes of the sons of men;* but my mercy shall not depart from him."
The words in italics are wanting in Chronicles; the meaning, that
Jehovah will not withdraw His grace from the dynasty of Judah
altogether, even though some of its members should deserve punishment,
is thereby destroyed and volatilised into an abstract idealism, which
shows that to the writer the Davidic kingly family is known only as a
dissolving view, and not by historical experience as it is to the author
of 2 Samuel vii.

In chaps xviii.-xx., Chronicles seems to refresh itself with a little
variety, relating as it does the foreign wars of David after the order
of 2 Sam., viii., x., xi. 1, xii. 30, 30, xxi. 18-22. But in this it
still keeps

<span id="page_178">p. 178</span>

in view its purpose, which is directed towards David as founder of the
Jerusalem worship; those wars brought him the wealth that was required
for the building of the temple. On the other hand, everything so fully
and beautifully told in the Book of Samuel about the home occurrences of
that period is omitted, for after all it does not contribute much to the
glorification of the king. So the story of Meribaal and Ziba (chap.
ix.), of Bathsheba and Uriah (xi., xii.), of Tamar and Amnon (xiii.,
xiv.), of Absalom's rebellion (xv.-xx.), and of the delivering-up of the
sons of Saul (xxi. 1-14). The rude and mechanical manner in which
statements about foreign wars are torn from the connection with domestic
events in which they stand in the older narrative is shown in 1 Chron.
xx. 1, 2, as compared with 2 Sam. xi. 1, xii. 30. In 2 Sam. xi. the
mention of the fact that David remained in Jerusalem when the army set
out against Rabbah, prepares for the story of his adultery with the wife
of a captain engaged in active service in the field; but 1 Chron. xx. 1
is meaningless, and involves a contradiction with ver. 2. according to
which David appears after all in the camp at Rabbah, although the
connection,—namely, that he followed the army—and all the intermediate
occurrences relating to Bathsheba and Uriah, are left out (De Wette, pp.
19, 20, 60). To what extent the veil is drawn over the scandalous falls
of saints may be judged also from the fact that from the list of David's
foreign encounters also, which are otherwise fully given, a single one
is omitted which he is supposed not to have come through with absolute
honour, that with the giant Ishbi-benob (2 Sam. xxi. 15-17). Lastly, the
alteration made in 1 Chron. xx. 5 is remarkable. Elhanan the son of Jair
of Bethlehem, we read in 2 Sam. xxi. 19, was he who slew Goliath of
Gath, the shaft of whose spear was as thick as a weaver's beam. But on
the other hand, had not David of Bethlehem according to 1 Sam. xvii.
vanquished Goliath the giant, the shaft of whose spear was as thick as a
weaver's beam? In Chronicles accordingly Elhanan smites *the brother* of
the veritable Goliath.

2\. The closing chapters of 2 Samuel (xxi.-xxiv.) are, admittedly, an
appendix of very peculiar structure. The thread of xxi. 1-14 is
continued in xxiv. 1-25, but in the interval between the two passages
occurs xxi. 15-xxiii. 39, in a very irrational manner, perhaps wholly
due to chance. In this interposed passage itself, again, the quite
similar lists xxi. 15-22 and xxiii. 8-39 are very closely connected;

<span id="page_179">p. 179</span>

and the two songs, xxii. 1-51, xxiii. 1-7, are thus an interpolation
within an interpolation. This want of order is imitated by the author of
Chronicles also, who takes 2 Sam. xxiii. 8-39 as separated from xxi.
15-22, and gives 2 Sam. xxiv. last, a position which does not belong to
it from any material considerations, but merely because it had
originally been tagged on as an appendix, and besides had been separated
from its connection with xxi. 1-14 by a large interpolation.

1 Chron. xxi. (the pestilence as punishment of David's sin in numbering
the people, and the theophany as occasioning the building of an altar on
the threshing-floor of Araunah) is on the whole a copy of 2 Sam. xxiv.,
but with omission of the precise and interesting geographical details of
ver. 5 seq., and with introduction of a variety of improving touches.
Thus (xxi. 1): "And Satan stood up against Israel and moved David;"
instead of: "And the anger of Jehovah was kindled against Israel, and he
moved David." Similarly (xxi. 6): "Levi and Benjamin Joab counted not
among them; for the king's word was abominable to him,"—an addition
which finds its explanation on the one hand in Num. i. 49, and on the
other in the circumstance that the holy city lay within the territory of
Benjamin. Again (xxi. 16, 27): "David saw the angel of Jehovah standing
between heaven and earth, and his sword drawn in his hand and stretched
out towards Jerusalem;" compare this with Sam xxiv. 16 (1 Chron. xxi.
15): "The angel stretched out his hand to Jerusalem to destroy it, and
he was by the threshing floor of Araunah;" according to the older view,
angels have no wings (Gen. xxviii.). Further (xxi. 25): "David gave to
Araunah for his threshing-floor 600 shekels of gold;" compare with 2
Sam. xxiv. 24, 50 shekels of silver; to make the king pay right royally
costs the Chronicler nothing. But lastly, his most significant addition
is the fire from heaven which consumes the burnt-offering (xxi. 26); by
this means the altar on the threshing-floor of Araunah, in other words,
that of the sanctuary of Jerusalem, is intended to be put on a level
with that of the tabernacle, its predecessor, the fire on which was also
kindled from heaven (Lev. ix. 24). Whoever has understood the narratives
of altar-buildings by the Patriarchs, by Joshua, Gideon, and Manoah,
will grant that the author of Chronicles has quite correctly understood
the intention of 2 Sam. xxiv., in accordance with which he here proposes
to relate the divine inauguration of the place of worship at Jerusalem;
but what in that passage, as in similar older legends

<span id="page_180">p. 180</span>

about the indication of consecrated places by means of a theophany, is
only hinted at for contemporaries who understood the idea conveyed, he
requires to retouch strongly in order that a later generation may notice
it; and yet he has half spoiled the point by making the angel not stand
by the threshing-floor of Araunah on the sacred spot, but hover aloft in
the air.

2 Sam. xxiv. = 1 Chron. xxi. serves further as a starting point for the
free construction of 1 Chron. xxii.-xxix. The circumstance that in the
last chapter of the Book of Samuel David builds the altar at Jerusalem
is expanded into the statement that in the last year of his reign he
prepared beforehand the building of the temple of Solomon in all its
parts down to the minutest detail. Unhampered by historical tradition,
the author here expatiates with absolute freedom in his proper element.
All that has hitherto been said about the king on the basis of the older
source is by means of additions and omissions fashioned into what shall
serve as a mere prologue to the proper work of his life, which is now
described thoroughly *con amore*. He himself unfortunately has not been
allowed to build the house, having shed much blood and carried on great
wars (xxii. 8, xxviii. 3), but he yet in the last year of his reign
forestalls from his successor the whole merit of the business (xxiii. 1,
xxviii. 1). My son Solomon, he says, is young and tender, but the house
to be built for Jehovah must be great and glorious; I will therefore
prepare it for him (xxii. 5). Accordingly he gets ready beforehand the
workmen and artificers, in particular bringing into requisition the
non-Israelitic population; he provides the material, stone and wood and
brass and iron, and gold and silver and jewels without number; he also
gives the plan or rather receives it direct from Jehovah, and that in
black and white (xxviii. 19), while Moses built the tabernacle only
according to his recollection of the heavenly pattern which had been
shown to him on Sinai. But before all he appoints the *personnel* for
the temple service,—priests, Levites, porters, singers,—divides their
thousands into classes, and assigns to them their functions by lot. In
doing so he interests himself, naturally, with special preference, in
the music, being the designer of the instruments (xxiii. 5), and himself
acting as principal conductor (xxv. 2, 6). And as he is still king after
all, he at the close takes an inventory also of his secular state, after
having duly ordered the spiritual. All this he does for the future, for
his son and successor; not in reality, but only in plan, are the
door-keepers,

<span id="page_181">p. 181</span>

for example, assigned to their posts (xxvi. 12 seq.), but none the less
with strictest specification and designation of the localities of the
temple,—and that too the second temple! His preparations concluded,
David calls a great assembly of prelates and notables (xxiii. 1, xxviii.
1), has Solomon anointed as king, and Zadok as priest (xxix. 22), and in
a long discourse hands over to the former along with the kingdom the
task of his reign, namely, the execution of what he himself has prepared
and appointed; on this occasion yet more precious stones and noble
metals—among them gold of Ophir and Persian darics—are presented by
David and the princes for the sacred building. The whole section 1
Chron. xxii.-xxix. is a startling instance of that statistical phantasy
of the Jews which revels in vast sums of money on paper (xxii. 14), in
artificial marshallings of names and numbers (xxiii.-xxvii.), in the
enumeration of mere subjects without predicates, which simply stand on
parade and neither signify nor do anything. The monotony is occasionally
broken only by unctuous phrases, but without refreshing the reader. Let
the experiment of reading the chapters through be tried.

According to 1 Kings i., ii., King David in his closing days was sick
and feeble in body and mind, and very far from being in a condition thus
to make preparations on behalf of his successor shortly before his own
death, or to prepare his bread for him so far that nothing remained but
to put it into the oven. His purpose of building a house to Jehovah is
indeed spoken of in 2 Sam. vii. in connection with vi. 17, but it is
definitively abandoned in consequence of Jehovah's refusal, on the
ground that it is not man's part to build a house for God, but God's to
build a house for man. In strange contrast with this explanation is that
of Chronicles that David is a man of war and has shed much blood, and
therefore dare not set up the temple; that he had waged the wars of
Jehovah, that Jehovah had given victory by his hand, would in the older
warlike time have seemed no reason against but rather an argument
establishing his fitness for such a work. But the worst discrepancy is
that between the solemn installation of Solomon as king and of Zadok as
priest with all the forms of law and publicity as related in 1 Chron.
xxviii., xxix. (comp. xxii., xxiii. 1) and the older narrative of 1
Kings i., ii. According to the latter it was much more an ordinary
palace intrigue, by means of which one party at court succeeded in
obtaining from the old king, enfeebled with age, his sanction for
Solomon's succession. Until then Adonijah had been regarded as
heir-apparent

<span id="page_182">p. 182</span>

to the throne, by David himself, by all Israel, and the great officers
of the kingdom, Joab and Abiathar; what above all things turned the
scale in favour of Solomon was the weight of Benaiah's six hundred
praetorians, a formidable force in the circumstances of the period. The
author of Chronicles naively supposes he has successfully evaded all
difficulties by giving out the coronation of Solomon related by himself
to be the second (xxix. 22),—an advertence to 1 Kings i., ii. which does
not remove but only betrays the contradiction.

Yet this is as nothing over against the disharmony of the total
impression. See what Chronicles has made out of David! The founder of
the kingdom has become the founder of the temple and the public worship,
the king and hero at the head of his companions in arms has become the
singer and master of ceremonies at the head of a swarm of priests and
Levites; his clearly cut figure has become a feeble holy picture, seen
through a cloud of incense. It is obviously vain to try to combine the
fundamentally different portraits into one stereoscopic image; it is
only the tradition of the older source that possesses historical value.
In Chronicles this is clericalised in the taste of the post-exilian
time, which had no feeling longer for anything but cultus and torah,
which accordingly treated as alien the old history (which, nevertheless,
was bound to be a sacred history), if it did not conform with its ideas
and metamorphose itself into church history. Just as the law framed by
Ezra as the foundation of Judaism was regarded as having been the work
of Moses, so what upon this basis had been developed after
Moses—particularly the music of the sanctuary and the ordering of the
temple *personnel*—was carried back to King David, the sweet singer of
Israel, who had now to place his music at the service of the cultus, and
write psalms along with Asaph, Heman, and Jeduthun, the Levitical
singing families.

3\. With regard to Solomon, Chronicles (2 Chron. i.-ix.) nowhere departs
very far from the lines of the Book of Kings. As the story of 1 Kings
i., ii., which is not an edifying one, and mercilessly assails that of 1
Chron. xxii.-xxix., required to be omitted, the narrative accordingly
begins with 1 Kings iii., with Solomon's accession, sacrifices on the
great altar at Gibeon, and the revelation of Jehovah, which was
thereupon communicated to him in a dream. This last is transcribed with
slight alterations, but at the outset a characteristic divergence is
found. "Solomon loved Jehovah, walking in the statutes of David his
father,

<span id="page_183">p. 183</span>

only he sacrificed and burnt incense on the high places (because there
was no house built unto the name of Jehovah until those days). And the
king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there; for that was the great high
place; a thousand burnt-offerings did Solomon offer upon that altar, and
Jehovah appeared unto him in a dream: Ask what I shall give thee." So 1
Kings iii. 2 seq. Chronicles, after its manner, first surrounds the king
with a great assemblage of captains of hundreds and thousands, of judges
and princes and heads of houses, and purely Pentateuchal dignities, and
then proceeds: "And Solomon and all the congregation with him went to
the high place in Gibeon, for there was God's tent of meeting, which
Moses, the servant of God, had made in the wilderness. But the ark of
God had David brought up from Kirjath-jearim, where he had prepared for
it; for he had pitched a tent for it at Jerusalem. But the brazen altar
that Bezaleel, the son of Uri, the son of Hur, had made, stood there,
before the tabernacle of Jehovah, and Solomon and the congregation
sought unto it. And Solomon offered there, upon the brazen altar, before
Jehovah, by the tent of meeting, he offered a thousand burnt-offerings,
and God appeared to him in a dream, saying, Ask what I shall give thee"
(2 Chron. i. 3 seq.). In the older narrative there is nothing about the
tabernacle, it being assumed that no apology would be either necessary
or possible for Solomon having sacrificed on a high place. Chronicles,
dominated in its views of antiquity by the Priestly Code, has missed the
presence of the tabernacle and supplied the want in accordance with that
norm; the young and pious king could not possibly have made his solemn
inaugural sacrifice, for which he had expressly left Jerusalem, anywhere
else than at the legally prescribed place; and still less could Jehovah
otherwise have bestowed on him His blessing. It betokens the narrowness,
and at the same time the boldness of the author, that he retains the
expression *high place* used in 1 Kings iii. 3, and co-ordinates it with
*tabernacle*, although the one means precisely the opposite of the
other. But it is instructive to notice how, on other occasions, he is
hampered by his Mosaic central sanctuary, which he has introduced *ad
hoc* into the history. According to 1 Chron. xvi. David is in the best
position to institute also a sacrificial service beside the ark of
Jehovah, which he has transferred to Zion; but he dare not, for the
Mosaic altar stands at Gibeon, and he must content himself with a
musical surrogate (vers. 37-42). The narrative of 1 Chron. xxi., that
David was led by the

<span id="page_184">p. 184</span>

theophany at the threshing-floor of Araunah to build an altar there, and
present upon it an offering that was accepted by heaven, is at its close
maimed and spoiled in a similar way by the remark, with anticipatory
reference to 2 Chron. i., that the Mosaic tabernacle and altar of burnt
offering were indeed at that time in the high place at Gibeon, but that
the king had not the strength to go before it to inquire of Jehovah,
being so smitten with fear of the angel with the drawn sword. So also
must the sacrifice which Solomon should have offered on his return from
Gibeon before the ark at Jerusalem be similarly ignored (2 Chron. i.
13), because it would destroy the force of the previous explanation of
the high place at Gibeon. Thus the shadow takes the air from the body.
In other places the tabernacle is significantly confounded with the
temple of Jerusalem (Graf, p. 56), but on the whole it remains a
tolerably inert conception, only made use of in the passage before us (2
Chron. i.) in an *ex machina* manner in order to clear Solomon of a
heavy reproach.

Upon the last solemn act of worship at the Mosaic sanctuary immediately
follows the building of the temple (i. 18 \[ii. 1\]-vii. 11), 1 Kings
iii. 10-v. 14 \[iv. 34\] being passed over. A few little touches are
however brought in to show the wealth of Solomon (i. 14-17); they do not
occur in Kings until chap. x. (vers. 26-29), and are also repeated in
Chronicles (ix. 25 seq.) in this much more appropriate connection (comp.
1 Kings iii., LXX). Strictly speaking indeed, David has taken the
preparations for the sacred building out of the hands of his successor,
but the latter appears not to be satisfied with these (ii. 16 \[17\])
and looks after them once more (i. 18-ii. 17 \[ii. 1-18\]). A comparison
with Ezra iii. (preparation of the second temple) shows that the story
is an elaboration of the author, although suggested by 1 Kings v. 16
\[2\] seq., and with preservation of many verbal reminiscences. While
Hiram and Solomon according to the older record are on a footing of
equality and make a contract based on reciprocity of service, the Tyrian
king is here the vassal of the Israelite, and renders to him what he
requires as tribute; instead of as there explaining himself by word of
mouth, he here writes a letter in which he not only openly avows his
faith in Jehovah the God of Israel, the maker of heaven and earth, but
also betrays an extraordinary acquaintance with the Pentateuchal
Priestly Code. The brassfounder whom Solomon brings from Tyre (1 Kings
vii. 13, 14) is (ii. 13) described as a very Dædalus and prodigy of
artistic skill, like

<span id="page_185">p. 185</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Bezaleel (Exodus
xxxi. 2 seq.); his being made the son of a woman of Dan and not of a
widow of Naphtali supplies interpreters with the materials for the
construction of a little family romance, <span
id="fr_110"></span>[1](#fn_110.md) but has no more real value than the idea
that sandalwood is obtained from Lebanon. The statement of 1 Kings v. 27
\[13\] (xi. 28, xii. 4) that Israel was requisitioned in large numbers
to render forced service to the king has substituted for it by the
Chronicler that which occurs in another place (1 Kings ix. 21), that
only the Canaanite serfs were employed for this purpose; at the same
time, he reckons their number from the figures supplied in 1 Kings v. 29
\[15\] seq. Lastly, the manner in which Solomon (ii. 2 \[3\]) assures
Hiram that he will arrange the divine service in the new house in a
thoroughly correct manner according to the ordinance of the Priestly
Code, is also characteristic; similar remarks, from which the
uninterrupted practice of the Mosaic cultus according to the rules of
the Law is made to appear, are afterwards repeated from time to time
(viii. 12-16, xiii. 11).

In chaps. iii., iv. the author repeats the description of the temple in
1 Kings vi., vii., with the omission of what relates to profane
buildings. Perhaps in one passage (1 Kings vii. 23) he found the now
very corrupt text in a better state; otherwise he has excerpted from it
in a wretchedly careless style or word for word transcribed it, adding
merely a few extravagances or appointments of later date (*e.g.*, the
specification of the gold in iii. 4 seq. 8, 9, of the ten golden tables
and hundred golden basins in iv. 8, of the brass-covered doors of the
outer gateway in iv. 9, of the court of the priests in iv. 9, of the
curtain between the holy place and the holy of holies in iii. 14;
compare Vatke, pp. 332, 333, 340, 341). To deny that the original (to
which reference must in many places be made in order that the meaning
may be understood) exists in 1 Kings vi., vii., requires an exercise of
courage which might be much better employed, all the more because in 2
Chron. iv. 11-v. 1, the summary list follows the description of details
precisely as in 1 Kings vii. 40-51.

While the concrete and material details of 1 Kings vi., vii. are
reproduced only in an imperfect and cursory manner, the act of
consecration on the other hand, and the discourse delivered by Solomon

<span id="page_186">p. 186</span>

on the occasion, is accurately and fully given (v. 2-vii. 10) in
accordance with 1 Kings viii.; such additions and omissions as occur are
all deliberate. In 1 Kings viii. the priests and Levites on an occasion
which so closely concerned their interests do not play any adequate
part, and in particular give none of the music which nevertheless is
quite indispensable at any such solemnity. Accordingly, the Chronicler
at the word "priests" inserts between the violently separated clauses of
1 Kings viii. 10, 11, the following: "For all the priests present had
sanctified themselves without distinction of classes, and the Levites,
the singers, all stood in white linen with cymbals and psalteries and
harps at the east end of the altar, and with them an hundred and twenty
priests sounding with trumpets. And it came to pass when the trumpeters
and singers were as one to make one sound to be heard in praising and
thanking the Lord, and when the music began with trumpets, and cymbals,
and instruments, and the song of praise, Praise ye Jehovah, for He is
good; for His mercy endureth for ever, then the house was filled with a
cloud" (v. 11-13). Proceeding, the narrative of 1 Kings viii. 22 that
Solomon came in front of the altar and there prayed is indeed in the
first instance copied (vi. 12), but forthwith authoritatively
interpreted in the sense that the king did not really and actually stand
before the altar (which was lawful for the priests alone), but upon an
improvised pulpit in the inner court upon a propped-up caldron of brass
(vi. 13), an excellent idea, which has met with the due commendation of
expositors. The close of Solomon's prayer (1 Kings viii. 49-53) is
abridged (vi. 39, 40)—perhaps in order to get rid of viii. 50—and there
is substituted for it an original epilogue (vi. 41, 42) recalling
post-exilian psalms. Then comes a larger omission, that of 1 Kings viii.
54-61, explained by the difficulty involved in the king's here kneeling,
not upon the caldron, but before the altar, then standing up and
blessing like a priest; in place of this it is told (vii. 1-3) how the
altar was consecrated by fire from heaven, which indeed had already
descended upon it (1 Chron. xxi. 26), but as it appears had
unaccountably gone out. In vii. 4 the author again returns to his
original at 1 Kings viii. 62 seq., but tricks it out, wherever it
appears to him too bare, with trumpeting priests and singing Levites
(vii. 6), and finally dismisses the people, not on the eighth day of the
feast of tabernacles (1 Kings viii. 66), but on the ninth (vii. to), in
accordance with the enactment in Num. xxix. 35.

<span id="page_187">p. 187</span>

The rest of Solomon's history (vii. 11-ix. 28) is taken over from 1
Kings ix., x. In doing so what is said in 1 Kings ix. 10-18, to the
effect that Solomon handed over to Hiram twenty Galilæan cities, is
changed into the opposite—that Hiram ceded the cities to Solomon, who
settled them with Israelites (viii. 1, 2); and similarly the already
observed statement of 1 Kings ix. 24 about the removal of Solomon's
Egyptian wife out of the city of David into his new palace <span
id="fr_111"></span>[1](#fn_111.md) is altered and put in quite a false
light: "Solomon brought up the daughter of Pharaoh out of the city of
David unto the house that he had built for her; for he said, No woman
shall dwell in the house of David, for the place is holy whereunto the
ark of Jehovah hath come" (viii. 11). There is no further need to speak
of viii. 12-16 (1 Kings ix. 25); more indifferent in their character are
the addition in vii. 12-15, a mere compilation of reminiscences, the
embellishment in viii. 3-6, derived from 1 Kings ix. 17-19, and the
variations in viii. 17 seq., ix. 21, misunderstood from 1 Kings ix. 26
seq., x. 22. The concluding chapter on Solomon's reign (1 Kings xi.), in
which the king does not appear in his most glorious aspect, is passed
over in silence, for the same motives as those which dictated the
omission of the two chapters at the beginning.

The history of the son is treated after the same plan and by the same
means as that of the father, only the subject accommodates itself more
readily to the purpose of the change. The old picture is retouched in
such wise that all dark and repulsive features are removed, and their
place taken by new and brilliant bits of colour not in the style of the
original but in the taste of the author's period,—priests and Levites
and fire from heaven, and the fulfilment of all righteousness of the
law, and much music, and all sorts of harmless legendary anachronisms
and exaggerations besides. The material of tradition seems broken up in
an extraneous medium, the spirit of post-exilian Judaism.

#### II.

1\. After Solomon's death the history of Israel in Chronicles is traced
only through Jehovah's kingdom in the hand of the sons

<span id="page_188">p. 188</span>

of David, and all that relates to the ten tribes is put aside. For
according to the notions of the Judaistic period Israel is the
congregation of true worship, and this last is connected with the temple
at Jerusalem, in which of course the Samaritans have no part. Abijah of
Judah makes this point of view clear to Jeroboam I. and his army in a
speech delivered from Mount Zemaraim before the battle. "Think ye to
withstand the kingdom of Jehovah in the hand of the sons of David,
because ye are a great multitude, and with you are the golden calves
which Jeroboam made you for gods? Have ye not cast out the priests of
Jehovah, the sons of Aaron and the Levites, and made for yourselves
priests after the manner of the Gentiles? so that whosoever cometh to
fill his hands with a young bullock and seven rams, even he may become a
priest for the false gods? But as for us, we have not forsaken Jehovah
our God, and our priests minister to Jehovah, the sons of Aaron and the
Levites in the service; and they burn unto Jehovah every morning and
every evening burnt sacrifices and sweet incense; the shewbread also is
upon the pure table; for we have maintained the service of Jehovah our
God, but ye have forsaken Him. And behold, God Himself is with us at our
head, and His priests, and the loud-sounding trumpets to cry an alarm
against you. O children of Israel, fight ye not against Jehovah the God
of your fathers, for ye shall not prosper" (2 Chron. xiii. 8-12; comp.
xi. 13-17).

The kingdom which bore the name of Israel was actually in point of fact
in the olden time the proper Israel, and Judah was merely a kind of
appendage to it. When Amaziah of Judah after the conquest of the
Edomites challenged to battle King Jehoash of Samaria, whose territory
had at that time suffered to the utmost under the continual wars with
the Syrians, the latter bid say to him: "The thistle that was in Lebanon
sent to the cedar that was in Lebanon, saying, Give thy daughter to my
son to wife;—then passed by a wild beast that was in Lebanon and trode
down the thistle. Thou hast indeed smitten Edom, and thy heart hath
lifted thee up. Enjoy thy glory, but tarry at home." (2 Kings xiv. 9,
10). And as the other would not listen, he punished him as if he had
been a naughty boy and then let him go. Religiously the relative
importance of the two corresponded pretty nearly to what it was
politically and historically. Israel was the cradle of prophecy; Samuel,
Elijah, and Elisha exercised their activity there; what contemporary
figure from Judah is there to place alongside of these?

<span id="page_189">p. 189</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Assuredly the
author of the Book of Kings would not have forgotten them had any such
there been, for he is a Judæan with all his heart, yet is compelled
purely by the nature of the case to interest himself chiefly about the
northern kingdom. And yet again at the very close it was the impending
fall of Samaria that called into life a new phase of prophecy; he who
inaugurated it, the Judæan Amos of Tekoah, was sent not to Judah but to
Israel, the history of which had the first and fullest sympathy of his
inmost soul as that of the people of Jehovah. Isaiah was the first who
placed Jerusalem in the centre of his field of vision and turned away
from Israel; for at the time of his first public appearance war was
raging between the sister nations, and when his activity was at its acme
all was over with the northern kingdom and all hope had to cling to the
remnant,—the fallen tabernacle of David. As regards the cultus,
certainly, matters may have been somewhat less satisfactory in Israel
than in Judah, at least in the last century before the Assyrian
captivity, but at the outset there was no essential difference. On all
hands Jehovah was worshipped as the peculiar divinity of the nation at
numerous fanes, in the service at the high places there were wanting
neither in the one nor in the other sacred trees, posts, and stones,
images of silver and gold (Isa. ii. 8 seq., xvii. 8, xxxi. 22; Mic. v.
12). It is a question whether in the time before Hezekiah the cultus of
the kingdom at Jerusalem had so much to distinguish it above that at
Bethel or at Dan; against Jeroboam's golden calves must be set the
brazen serpent of Moses, and the ark of Jehovah itself—which in ancient
times was an idol (1 Sam. iv.-vi.) and did not become idealised into an
ark of the covenant, *i.e.*, of the law, until probably it had actually
disappeared. As for the prophetic reaction against the popular cultus,
the instance of Hosea shows that it came into activity as early and as
powerfully in Israel as in Judah. Even after Josiah's reformation
Jeremiah complains that the sister who hitherto had been spared is in no
respect better than the other who a hundred years before had fallen a
victim to the Assyrians (iii. 6-10); and though in principle the author
of the Book of Kings, taking his stand upon Deuteronomy, prefers Judah
and Jerusalem, yet he does not out of deference to this judgment alter
the facts which show that old Israel was not further than old Judah from
compliance with the Deuteronomic precepts.

Chronicles, on the other hand, not only takes the Law—the Pentachal Law
as a whole, but more particularly the Priestly Code therein

<span id="page_190">p. 190</span>

preponderating—as its rule of judgment on the past; but also idealises
the facts in accordance with that norm, and figures to itself the old
Hebrew people as in exact conformity with the pattern of the later
Jewish community,—as a monarchically graded hierocracy with a strictly
centralised cultus of rigidly prescribed form at the holy place of
Jerusalem. When, accordingly, the ten tribes fail to exhibit all the
marks of the kingdom of God, this is taken to mean their falling away
from the true Israel; they have made goats and calves their gods, driven
away the priests and Levites, and in a word broken quite away from the
institutions which shaped themselves in Judah during the period
subsequent to Josiah and received their finishing-touches from
Ezra. <span id="fr_112"></span>[1](#fn_112.md) Like other heathen,
therefore, they are taken account of by the sacred history only in so
far as they stood in relations of friendship or hostility with the
people of Jehovah properly so called, the Israel in the land of Judah (2
Chron. xxiii. 2), and in all references to them the most sedulous and
undisguised partisanship on behalf of Judah is manifested, even by the
inhabitants of the northern kingdom itself. <span
id="fr_113"></span>[2](#fn_113.md) If one seriously takes the Pentateuch as
Mosaic law, this exclusion of the ten tribes is, in point of fact, an
inevitable consequence, for the mere fact of their belonging to the
people of Jehovah destroys the fundamental pre-supposition of that
document, the unity and legitimacy of the worship as basis of the
theocracy, the priests and Levites as its most important organs, "the
sinews and muscles of the body politic, which keep the organism together
as a living and moving whole."

2\. The reverse side is, of course, the idealisation of Judah from the
point of view of the legitimate worship,—a process which the reader can
imagine from the specimens already given with reference to David and
Solomon. The priests and Levites who migrated from Israel are
represented as having strengthened the southern kingdom (xi. 17), and
here constitute the truly dominant element in the history. It is for
their sake that kings exist as protectors and guardians of the cultus,
with the internal arrangements of which, however, they dare not
intermeddle (xxvi. 16 seq.); to deliver discourses and ordain spiritual

<span id="page_191">p. 191</span>

solemnities (which figure as the culminating points in the narrative)
are among the leading duties of their reign. <span
id="fr_114"></span>[1](#fn_114.md)

Those among them who are good apprehend their task and are inseparable
from the holy servants of Jehovah,—so, in particular, Jehoshaphat,
Hezekiah, and Josiah. Of the first mentioned we are told that in the
third year of his reign he appointed a royal commission of notables,
priests, and Levites, to go about with the Book of the Law, and teach in
the cities of Judah (xvii. 7-9); in the larger places, in the
strongholds, he further instituted colleges of justice, and over them a
supreme tribunal at Jerusalem, also consisting of priests, Levites, and
notables, under the presidency of the high priest for spiritual, and of
the Prince of the house of Judah for secular affairs (xix. 5-11). There
is nothing about this in the Book of Kings, although what is of less
importance is noticed (1 Kings xxii. 47); the Chronicler makes the
statement in his own language, which is unmistakable, especially in the
pious speeches. Probably it is the organisation of justice as existing
in his own day that he here carries back to Jehoshaphat, so that here
most likely we have the oldest testimony to the synedrium of Jerusalem
as a court of highest instance over the provincial synedria, as also to
its composition and presidency. The impossibility of such a judiciary
system in antiquity is clear from its presupposing the Book of the Law
as its basis, from its co-ordination of priests and Levites, and also
from its actual inconsistency with incidental notices, particularly in
Isaiah and the older prophets (down to Jeremiah xxvi.), in which it
everywhere is taken for granted as a thing of course that the rulers are
also at the same time the natural judges. Moreover, Chronicles already
tells us about David something similar to what it says about Jehoshaphat
(1 Chron. xxiii. 4, xxvi. 29-32); the reason why the latter is selected
by preference for this work lies simply in his name "Jehovah is Judge,"
as he himself is made to indicate in various ways (xix. 5-11; compare
Joel iv. 12). But the king of Judah is strengthened by the priests and
Levites, not only in these domestic affairs, but also for war. As the
trumpets of the priests give to Abijah courage and the victory against
Jeroboam of Israel, so do the Levites also to Jehoshaphat against Moab
and Ammon. Having fasted, and received, while praying, the comfortable
assurance of the singer Jahaziel ("See God"), he advances next morning,
with his army, against the enemy, having in the van the Levites, who
march in sacred attire in front of the armed men and sing:

<span id="page_192">p. 192</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> "Praise ye the
Lord, for His mercy endureth for ever." He then finds that the fighting
has already been done by the enemy themselves, who, at the sound of that
song of praise, have fallen upon and annihilated one another. Three days
are spent in dividing the spoil, and then he returns as he came, the
Levitical music leading the van, with psalteries, and harps, and
trumpets to the house of Jehovah (2 Chron. xx. 1-28). Hezekiah is
glorified in a similar manner. Of the Assyrian siege of Jerusalem and
the memorable relief, comparatively little is made (xxxii. 1 seq.; comp.
De Wette, i. 75); according to Chronicles, his master-work is that, as
soon as he has mounted the throne, in the first month of the year, and
of his reign (Exod. xl. 2; Lev. ix. 1). he institutes by means of the
priests and Levites, whom he addresses quite paternally as his children
(xxix. 11), a great feast of consecration of the temple, alleged to have
been closed and wasted by Ahaz; thereupon in the second month to
celebrate the passover in the most sumptuous manner; and finally, from
the third to the seventh month to concern himself about the accurate
rendering of their dues to the clergy. All is described in the
accustomed style, in the course of three long chapters, which tell us
nothing indeed about the time of Hezekiah, but are full of information
for the period in which the writer lived, particularly with reference to
the method then followed in offering the sacred dues (xxix. 1-xxxi. 21).
In the case of Josiah also the account of his epoch-making reformation
of the worship is, on the whole, reproduced in Chronicles only in a
mutilated manner, but the short notice of 2 Kings xxiii. 21-23 is
amplified into a very minute description of a splendid passover feast,
in which, as always, the priests and above all the Levites figure as the
leading personalities. In this last connection one little trait worth
noticing remains, namely, that the great assembly in which the king
causes the Book of the Law to be sworn to, is, in every other respect,
made up in 2 Chron. xxxiv. 29 seq. exactly as it is in 2 Kings xxiii.
1,, except that instead of "the priests and *prophets*" we find "the
priests and *Levites*." The significance of this is best seen from the
Targum, where "the priests and prophets" are translated into "the
priests and *scribes*."

By this projection of the legitimate cultus prescribed in the Law and
realised in Judaism, the Chronicler is brought however into a peculiar
conflict with the statements of his authority, which show that the said
cultus was not a mature thing which preceded all history, but came
gradually into being in the course of history; he makes his escape

<span id="page_193">p. 193</span>

as well as he can, but yet not without a strange vacillation between the
timeless manner of looking at things which is natural to him, and the
historical tradition which he uses and appropriates. The verses in 1
Kings (xiv. 22, 23): Judah (not Rehoboam merely) did that which was evil
in the sight of Jehovah and provoked Him to jealousy by their sins which
they sinned, above all that their fathers had done; and they set up for
themselves high places, *maççeboth* and *asherim*, &c., which in the
passage where they occur are, like the parallel statement regarding
Israel (xii. 25 seq.), of primary importance, and cancel by one bold
stroke the alleged difference of worship between the Levitical and
non-Levitical kingdom, are omitted as quite too impossible, although the
whole remaining context is preserved (2 Chron. xii. 1-16). In the same
way the unfavourable judgment upon Rehoboam's successor Abijah (1 Kings
xv. 3-5) is dropped, because the first kings of Judah, inasmuch as they
maintain the true religion against those of Israel who have fallen away
from it, must of necessity have been good. But though the Chronicler is
silent about what is bad, for the sake of Judah's honour, he cannot
venture to pass over the improvement which, according to 1 Kings xv. 12
seq., was introduced in Asa's day, although one does not in the least
know what need there was for it, everything already having been in the
best possible state. Nay, he even exaggerates this improvement, and
makes of Asa another Josiah (2 Chron. xv. 1-15), represents him also
(xiv. 3) as abolishing the high places, and yet after all (xv. 1 7)
repeats the statement of 1 Kings xv. 14 that the high places were not
removed. So also of Jehoshaphat, we are told in the first place that he
walked in the first ways of his father Asa and abolished the high places
in Judah (2 Chron. xvii. 3, 6, xix. 3), a false generalisation from 1
Kings (xxii. 43, 47); and then afterwards we learn (xx. 32, 33) that the
high places still remained, word for word according to 1 Kings xxii. 43,
44. To the author it seems on the one hand an impossibility that the
worship of the high places, which in spite of xxxiii. 17 is to him
fundamentally idolatry, should not have been repressed even by pious,
*i.e.*, law-observing kings, and yet on the other hand he mechanically
transcribes his copy.

In the case of the notoriously wicked rulers his resort is to make them
simply heathen and persecutors of the covenant religion, for to him they
are inconceivable within the limits of Jehovism, which always in his
view has had the Law for its norm, and is one and the same with the
exclusive Mosaism of Judaism. So first, in the case of Joram: he

<span id="page_194">p. 194</span>

makes high places on the hills of Judah and seduces the inhabitants of
Jerusalem to commit fornication, and Judah to apostatise (xxi. 11), and
moreover slays all his brethren with the sword (ver. 4)—the one follows
from the other. His widow Athaliah breaks up the house of Jehovah by the
hand of her sons (who had been murdered, but for this purpose are
revived), and makes images of Baal out of the dedicated things (xxiv.
7); none the less on that account does the public worship of Jehovah go
on uninterrupted under Jehoiada the priest. Most unsparing is the
treatment that Ahaz receives. According to 2 Kings xvi. 10 seq., be saw
at Damascus an altar which took his fancy, and he caused a similar one
to be set up at Jerusalem after its pattern, while Solomon's brazen
altar was probably sent to the melting-pot; it was Urijah the priest who
carried out the orders of the king. One observes no sign of autonomy, or
of the inviolable divine right of the sanctuary; the king commands and
the priest obeys. To the Chronicler the story so told is quite
incomprehensible; what does he make of it? Ahaz introduced the
idolatrous worship of Damascus, abolished the worship of Jehovah, and
shut up the temple (2 Chron. xxviii. 23 seq.). He regards not the person
of a man, the inflexible unity of the Mosaic cultus is everything to the
Chronicler, and its historical identity would be destroyed if an
orthodox priest, a friend of the prophet Isaiah, had lent a helping hand
to set up a foreign altar. To make idolaters pure and simple of Manasseh
and Amon any heightening of what is said in 2 Kings xxi. was hardly
necessary; and besides, there were here special reasons against drawing
the picture in too dark colours. It is wonderful also to see how the
people, which is always animated with alacrity and zeal for the Law, and
rewards its pious rulers for their fidelity to the covenant (xv. 15,
xvii. 5, xxiv. 10, xxxi. 10), marks its censure of these wicked kings by
withholding from them, or impairing, the honour of royal burial (xxi.
19, 20, xxviii. 27, xxxiii. 10),—in spite of 2 Kings ix. 28, xvi. 20,
xxi. 1 8.

The periodically recurring invasions of heathenism help, at the same
time, to an understanding of the consequent reforms, which otherwise
surpass the comprehension of the Jewish scribe. According to the Books
of Kings, Joash, Hezekiah, and Josiah hit upon praiseworthy innovations
in the temple cultus, set aside deeply rooted and immemorial customs,
and reformed the public worship of Jehovah. These advances *within*
Jehovism, which, of course, are quite incompatible with its

<span id="page_195">p. 195</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Mosaic fixity, are
made by the Chronicler to be simple restorations of the pure religion
following upon its temporary violent suspension. It is in Hezekiah's
case that this is done in the most thoroughgoing manner. After his
predecessor has shut the doors of the house of Jehovah, put out the
lights, and brought the service to an end, he sets all in operation
again by means of the resuscitated priests and Levites; the first and
most important act of his reign is the consecration of the temple (2
Chron. xxix.), with which is connected (xxx., xxxi.) the restoration of
the passover and the restitution of the temporalia to the clergy, who,
as it seems, have hitherto been deprived of them. That 2 Kings xviii.
1-7, although very different, has supplied the basis for all these
extravagances, is seen by comparing 2 Chron. xxix. 1, 2, xxxi. 1, 20,
21, xxxii. 22 only, that the king destroyed the brazen serpent Nehushtan
(2 Kings xviii. 4) is passed over in silence, as if it were incredible
that such an image should have been worshipped down to that date in the
belief that it had come down from the time of Moses; the not less
offensive statement, on the other hand, that he took away *the Asherah*
(by which only that of the temple altar can be understood; comp. Deut.
xvi. 21) is got over by charging the singular into the plural; he took
away *the Asherahs* (xxxi. 1), which occurred here and there throughout
Judah, of course at heathen altars.

In the cases of Joash and Josiah the free flight of the Chronicler's
law-crazed fancy is hampered by the copy to which he is tied, and which
gives not the results merely, but the details of the proceedings
themselves (2 Chron. xxii., xxiii.; 2 Kings xi., xii.). It is precisely
such histories as these, almost the only circumstantially told ones
relating to Judah in the Book of Kings, which though in their nature
most akin to our author's preference for cultus, bring him into the
greatest embarrassment, by introducing details which to his notions are
wholly against the Law, and yet must not be represented otherwise than
in the most favourable light.

It cannot be doubted that the sections about Joash in 2 Kings (xi.
1-xii. 17 \[16\]), having their scene end subject laid in the temple,
are at bottom identical with 2 Chron. xxii. 10-xxiv. 14. In the case of
2 Kings xi., to begin with, the beginning and the close, vers. 1-3,
vers. 13-20, recur verbatim in 2 Chron. xxii. 10-12, xxiii. 12-21, if
trifling alterations be left out of account. But in the central portion
also there occur passages which are taken over into 2 Chronicles without
any change,

<span id="page_196">p. 196</span>

Only here they are inappropriate, while in the original connection they
are intelligible. For the meaning and colour of the whole is entirely
altered in Chronicles, as the following comparison in the main passage
will show; to understand it one must bear in mind that the regent
Athaliah has put to death all the members of the house of David who had
escaped the massacre of Jehu, with the exception of the child Joash,
who, with the knowledge of Jehoiada, the priest, has found hiding and
protection in the temple.

Can the enthronement of Joash, as on a former occasion that of Solomon,
possibly have been accomplished by the agency of the bodyguard of the
kings of Judah? Is it possible that the high priest should have made a
covenant with the captains within the house of Jehovah, and himself have
held out the inducement to those half-pagan mercenaries to penetrate
into the temple precincts? That were indeed an outrage upon the Law not
lightly to be imputed to so holy a man! Why then did not Jehoiada make
use of his own guard, the myriads of Levites who were at his command?
Such a course was the only right one, and therefore that which was
followed. "No one shall come into the house of Jehovah save the priests
and they of the Levites that minister:" in accordance with this
fundamental principle stated by himself (xxiii. 6; comp ver. 7 *into the
house* instead of *within the ranks*), our pious historian substitutes
his priests and Levites for the Carians and runners. Hereby also
Jehoiada comes into the place that belongs to him as sovereign of the
sanctuary and of the congregation. He therefore needs no longer to set
on foot in secret a conspiracy with the chiefs of the body-guard, but
through his own spiritual officers calls together the Levites and heads
of houses from all the cities of Judah into the temple,

<span id="page_198">p. 198</span>

and causes the whole assemblage there to enter into a covenant with the
young king. The glaring inconsistencies inevitably produced by the new
colouring thus given to individual parts of the old picture must simply
be taken as part of the bargain. If Jehoiada has unrestricted sway over
such a force and sets about his revolution with the utmost publicity,
then it is he and not Athaliah who has the substance of power; why then
all this trouble about the deposition of the tyrant? Out of mere delight
in Levitical pomp and high solemnities? What moreover is to be done with
the captains who are retained in xxiii. 1, 9, and in ver. 14 are even
called officers of the host as in 2 Kings xi 15, after their soldiers
have been taken from them or metamorphosed? Had the Levites a military
organisation, and, divided into three companies, did they change places
every week in the temple service? The commentators are inclined to call
in to their aid such inventive assumptions, with which, however, they
may go on for ever without attaining their end, for the error multiplies
itself. As a specially striking instance of the manner in which the
procedure of Chronicles avenges itself may be mentioned chapter xxiii.
8: "and they took each his men," &c. The words are taken from 2 Kings
xi. 9, but there refer to the captains, while here the antecedents are
the Levites and all the men of Judah—as if each one of these last had a
company of his own which entered upon service, or left it, every Sabbath
day.

The comparison of 2 Chron. xxiv. 4-14 with 2 Kings xii. 5-17 \[4-16\] is
not much less instructive. According to 2 Kings xii. Joash enjoined that
all the money dues payable to the temple should in future fall to the
priests, who in turn were to be under obligation to maintain the
building in good repair. But they took the money and neglected the other
side of the bargain, and when they and Jehoiada in particular were
blamed by the king on that account, they gave up the dues so as not to
be liable to the burden. Thereupon the king set up a kind of sacred
treasury, a chest with a hole in the lid, near the altar, "on the right
hand as one goes into the temple," into which the priests were to cast
the money which came in, with the exception of the sin and trespass
moneys, which still belonged to them. And as often as the chest became
full, the king's scribes and the chief priest removed the money, weighed
it, and handed it over to the contractors for payment of the workmen;
that none of it was to be employed for sacred vessels is expressly said
(ver. 14). This arrangement by King

<span id="page_199">p. 199</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Joash was a
lasting one, and still subsisted in Josiah's time (2 Kings xxii. 3
seq.).

The arbitrary proceeding of Joash did not well suit the ideas of an
autonomous hierocracy. According to the Law the current money dues fell
to the priests; no king had the right to take them away and dispose of
them at his pleasure. How was it possible that Jehoiada should waive his
divine right and suffer such a sacrilegious invasion of sacred
privileges? how was it possible that he should be blamed for his (at
first) passive resistance of the illegal invasion; how was it possible
at all that the priest in his own proper department should be called to
account by the king? Chronicles knows better than that. The wicked
Athaliah had wasted and plundered the temple; Joash determined to
restore it, and for this purpose to cause money to be collected
throughout all Israel by the agency of the Levites. But as these last
were in no hurry, he made a chest and set it outside in the doorway of
the sanctuary; there the people streamed past, and gentle and simple
with joyful heart cast in their gifts until the chest was full. This
being announced by the keepers of the door, the king's scribe and the
delegate of the high priest came to remove the money; with it the king
and the high priest paid the workmen, and what remained over was made
into costly vessels (2 Chron. xxiv. 5-14). According to this account
Joash makes no arrangement whatever about the sacred dues, but sets on
foot an extraordinary collection, as had once been done by Moses for the
building of the tabernacle (xxiv. 6, 9); following upon this, everything
else also which in 2 Kings xii. is a permanent arrangement, here figures
as an isolated occurrence; instead of necessary repairs of the temple
constantly recurring, only one extraordinary restoration of it is
mentioned, and for this occasional purpose only is the treasure chest
set up,—not, however, beside the altar, but only at the doorway (xxiv.
8; comp. 2 Kings xii. 10). The clergy, the Levites, are charged only
with making the collection, not with maintaining the building out of the
sacred revenues; consequently they are not reproached with keeping the
money to themselves, but only with not being heartily enough disposed
towards the collection. It appears, however, that they were perfectly
justified in this backwardness, for the king has only to set up the
"treasury of God," when forthwith it overflows with the voluntary
offerings of the people who flock to it, so that out of the proceeds
something remains over (ver. 14) for certain other purposes—which

<span id="page_200">p. 200</span>

according to 2 Kings xii. 14 \[13\] were expressly excluded. Joash
imposes no demands at all upon the priests, and Jehoiada in particular
stands over against him as invested with perfectly equal rights; if the
king sends his scribe, the high priest also does not appear personally,
but causes himself to be represented by a delegate (xxiv. 11; comp. 2
Kings xii. 11 \[10\]). Here also many a new piece does not come well
into the old garment, as De Wette (i. 100) shows. Chronicles itself
tacitly gives the honour to the older narrative by making Joash at last
apostatise from Mosaism and refuse the grateful deference which he owed
to the high priest; this is the consequence of the unpleasant
impression, derived not from its own story, but from that of the Book of
Kings, with regard to the undue interference of the otherwise pious king
in the affairs of the sanctuary and of the priests.

Chronicles reaps the fruits of its perversion of 2 Kings xii. in its
reproduction of the nearly related and closely connected section 2 Kings
xxii. 3-10. It is worth while once more to bring the passages together.

The occasion on which the priest introduces the Book of the Law to the
notice of Shaphan has presuppositions in the arrangement made by Joash
which Chronicles has destroyed, substituting others in its place,—that
the temple had been destroyed under the predecessors of Josiah, but that
under the latter money was raised by the agency of peripatetic Levites
throughout all Israel for the restoration, and in the first instance
deposited in the treasure-chest. At the emptying of this chest the
priest is then alleged to have found the book (ver. 14, after Deut.
xxxi. 26), notwithstanding that on this occasion Shaphan also and the
two accountants added in ver. 8 were present, and ought therefore to
have had a share in the discovery which, however, is excluded by ver. 15
(= 2 Kings xxii. 8). There are other misunderstandings

<span id="page_202">p. 202</span>

besides; in particular, the superintendents of the works (*muphkadim*),
to whom, according to the original narrative, the money is handed over
for payment, are degraded to the rank of simple workmen, from whom,
nevertheless, they are again afterwards distinguished; and while in 2
Kings xxii. 7 they are represented as dealing faithfully *in paying out
the money*, in 2 Chron. xxxiv. 12 they deal faithfully *in their work*.
Perhaps, however, this is no mere misunderstanding, but is connected
with the endeavour to keep profane hands as far off as possible from
that which is holy, and, in particular, to give the management of the
work to the Levites (vers. 12,13). To what length the anxiety of later
ages went in this matter is seen in the statement of Josephus (*Ant.*,
xv. 11, 2), that Herod caused one thousand priests to be trained as
masons and carpenters for the building of his temple. The two most
interesting alterations in Chronicles are easily overlooked. In ver. 1 8
the words: "He read the book to the king," are changed into "He read
*out of* the book to the king;" and after "Hilkiah gave the book to
Shaphan" (ver. 15) the words "and he read it" are omitted. In 2 Kings
the book appears as of very moderate size, but the author of Chronicles
figures to himself the whole Pentateuch under that name.

In the sequel 2 Kings xxii. 11-xxiii. 3 is indeed repeated verbatim in 2
Chron. xxxiv. 19-32, but the incomparably more important section
connected with it (xxiii. 4-10), giving a detailed account of Josiah's
vigorous reformation, is omitted, and its place taken by the meagre
remark that the king removed all abominations out of Israel (xxxiv. 33);
in compensation his passover feast is described all the more fully
(chap. xxxv.). In recording also the finding and publication of the Law,
Chronicles fails to realise that this document begins now for the first
time to be historically operative, and acquires its great importance
quite suddenly. On the contrary, it had been from the days of Moses the
basis on which the community rested, and had been in force and validity
at all normal times; only temporarily could this life-principle of the
theocracy be repressed by wicked kings, forthwith to become vigorous and
active again as soon as the pressure was removed. As soon as Ahaz has
closed his eyes, Hezekiah, in the first month of his first year, again
restores the Mosaic cultus; and as soon as Josiah reaches years of
discretion he makes good the sins of his fathers. Being at his accession
still too young, the eighth year of his reign is, as a tribute to
propriety, selected instead of the eighth year of his life, and the
great

<span id="page_203">p. 203</span>

reformation assigned to that period which in point of fact he undertook
at a much later date (xxxiv. 3-7 = 2 Kings xxiii. 4-20). Thus the
movement happily becomes separated from its historical occasion, and in
character the innovation appears rather as a simple recovery of the
spring after the pressure on it has been removed. The mist disappears
before the sun of the Law, which appears in its old strength; its light
passes through no phases, but shines from the beginning with uniform
brightness. What Josiah did had also been done before him already by
Asa, then by Jehoshaphat, then by Hezekiah; the reforms are not steps in
a progressive development, but have all the same unchanging contents.
Such is the influence upon historical vision of that transcendental
Mosaism raised far above all growth and process of becoming, which can
be traced even in the Book of Kings, but is so much more palpable in the
Book of Chronicles.

3\. Apart from the fact that it represents the abiding tradition of the
legitimate cultus at Jerusalem, the history of Judah in the Book of
Chronicles has yet another instructive purpose. In the kingdom of Judah
it is not a natural and human, but a divine pragmatism that is
operative. To give expression to this is what the prophets exist for in
unbroken succession side by side with high priests and kings; they
connect the deeds of men with the events of the course of the world, and
utilise the sacred history as a theme for their preaching, as a
collection of examples illustrative of the promptest operation of the
righteousness of Jehovah. In doing so they do not preach what is new or
free, but have at their command, like Jehovah Himself, only the Law of
Moses, setting before their hearers prosperity and adversity in
conformity with the stencil pattern, just as the law is faithfully
fulfilled or neglected. Of course their prophecies always come exactly
true, and in this way is seen an astonishing harmony between inward
worth and outward circumstance. Never does sin miss its punishment, and
never where misfortune occurs is guilt wanting.

In the fifth year of Rehoboam Judah and Jerusalem were ravaged by
Pharaoh Shishak (1 Kings xiv. 25). The explanation is that three years
they walked in the ways of David and Solomon, because for three years
they were strengthened and reinforced by the priests and Levites and
other pious persons who had immigrated from the northern kingdom (2
Chron. xi. 17); but thereafter in the fourth year, after the kingdom of
Rehoboam had been strengthened and confirmed, he forsook the Law

<span id="page_204">p. 204</span>

and all Israel with him (xii. 1)—and in the fifth year followed the
invasion of Shishak. A prophet announces this, and in consequence the
king humbles himself along with his people and escapes with
comparatively trifling punishment, being thought worthy to reign yet
other twelve years.

Asa in his old age was diseased in his feet (1 Kings xv. 23). According
to 2 Chron. xvi. 12, he died of this illness, which is described as
extremely dangerous, in the forty-first year of his reign, after having
already been otherwise unfortunate in his later years. And why? He had
invoked foreign aid, instead of the divine, against Baasha of Israel.
Now, as Baasha survived only to the twenty-sixth year of Asa, the
wickedness must have been perpetrated before that date. But in that case
its connection with the punishment which overtook the king only towards
the close of his life would not be clear. Baasha's expedition against
Jerusalem, accordingly, and the Syrian invasion of Israel occasioned by
Asa on that account are brought down in Chronicles to the thirty-sixth
year of the latter (xvi. 1). It has been properly observed that Baasha
was at that date long dead, and the proposal has accordingly been made
to change the number thirty-six into sixteen,—without considering that
the first half of the reign of Asa is expressly characterised as having
been prosperous, that the thirty-fifth year is already reached in chap.
xv. 19, and that the correction destroys the connection of the passage
with what follows (xvi. 7 seq.). For it is in connection with that
flagitious appeal for aid to the Syrians that the usual prophet makes
his appearance (xvi. 7), and makes the usual announcement of impending
punishment. It is Hanani, a man of Northern Israel (1 Kings xvi. 7), but
Asa treats him as if he were one of his own subjects, handles him
severely, and shuts him in prison. By this he hastens and increases his
punishment, under which he falls in the forty-first year of his reign.

Jehoshaphat, the pious king, according to 1 Kings xxii., took part in
the expedition of the godless Ahab of Israel against the Damascenes.
Chronicles cannot allow this to pass unrebuked, and accordingly when the
king returns in peace, the same Hanani announces his punishment, albeit
a gracious one (2 Chron. xix. 1-3). And gracious indeed it is; the
Moabites and Ammonites invade the land, but Jehoshaphat without any
effort on his part wins a glorious victory, and inexhaustible plunder
(xx. 1 seq.). One cannot blame him, therefore, for once more entering

<span id="page_205">p. 205</span>

into an alliance with Ahab's successor for a naval expedition to be
undertaken in common, which is to sail from a port of the Red Sea,
probably round Africa, to Tarshish (Spain, 2 Chron. ix. 21). But this
time he is punished more seriously as Eliezer the son of Dodavah had
prophesied, the ships are wrecked. Compare on the other hand 1 Kings
xxii. 48, 49: "Jehoshaphat made ships of Tarshish to go to Ophir for
gold, but they went not, for the ships were wrecked in the harbour on
the Red Sea. At that time Ahaziah the son of Ahab had said to
Jehoshaphat: Let my servants go with thy servants in the ships; but
Jehoshaphat would not." So the original statement. But in Chronicles a
moral ground must be found for the misfortune, and Jehoshaphat therefore
makes with the king of Samaria a sinful alliance, which in point of fact
he had declined, not indeed from religious motives.

Joram, the son of Jehoshaphat, conducted himself very ill, it is said in
2 Kings viii. 18; Chronicles enhances his offence, and above all adds
the merited reward (xxi. 4, seq.). Elijah, although he had quitted this
earth long before (2 Kings iii. 11 seq.), must write to the offender a
letter, the threats of which are duly put into execution by Jehovah. The
Philistines and Arabians having previously pressed him hard, he falls
into an incurable sickness of the bowels, which afflicts him for years,
and finally brings him to his end in a most frightful manner (xxi. 12,
seq.). In concurrence with the judgment of God, the people withhold from
the dead king the honours of royalty, and he is not buried beside his
fathers, notwithstanding 2 Kings viii. 24.

Joash, according to 2 Kings xii., was a pious ruler, but met with
misfortune; he was compelled to buy off Hazael, who had laid siege to
Jerusalem, at a heavy price, and finally he died by the assassin's hand.
Chronicles is able to tell how he deserved this fate. In the sentence:
"He did what was right in the sight of the Lord *all his days*, because
Jehoiada the high priest had instructed him" (2 Kings xii. 3 \[2\]), it
alters the last expression into "*all the days of Jehoiada the priest*,"
(xxiv. 2). After the death of his benefactor he fell away, and showed
his family the basest ingratitude; at the end of that very year the
Syrians invade him; after their departure his misfortunes are increased
by a dreadful illness, under which he is murdered (xxiv. 17 seq.).

Amaziah was defeated, made prisoner, and severely punished by Jehoash,
king of Samaria, whom he had audaciously challenged

<span id="page_206">p. 206</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (2 Kings xiv. 8
seq.). Why? because he had set up in Jerusalem idols which had been
carried off from Edom, and served them (2 Chron. xxv. 1 4). He prefers
the plundered gods of a vanquished people to Jehovah at the very moment
when the latter has proved victorious over them! From the time of this
apostasy—a crime for which no punishment could be too great—his own
servants are also stated to have conspired against him and put him to
death (xxv. 27), and yet we are assured in ver. 25 (after 2 Kings xiv.
I;) that Amaziah survived his adversary by fifteen years.

Uzziah, one of the best kings of Judah, became a leper, and was
compelled to hand over the regency to his son Jotham (2 Kings xv. 5);
for, adds Chronicles, "when he had become strong, his heart was lifted
up, even to ruin, so that he transgressed against Jehovah his God, and
went into the temple of Jehovah, to burn incense upon the altar of
incense. And Azariah the priest went in after him, and with him
fourscore priests of Jehovah, and withstood him and said: It is not for
thee to burn incense, but only for the sons of Aaron who are consecrated
thereto. Then Uzziah was wroth and laid not the censer aside, and the
leprosy rose up in his forehead, and the priests thrust him out from
thence" (xxvi. 16-20). The matter is now no longer a mystery.

Ahaz was a king of little worth, and yet he got fairly well out of the
difficulty into which the invasion of the allied Syrians and Israelites
had brought him by making his kingdom tributary to the Assyrian
Tiglath-Pileser (2 Kings xvi. 1 seq.). But Chronicles could not possibly
let him off so cheaply. By it he is delivered into the hand of the
enemy: the Israelites alone slaughter 120,000 men of Judah, including
the king's son and his most prominent servants, and carry off to Samaria
200,000 women and children, along with a large quantity of other booty.
The Edomites and Philistines also fall upon Ahaz, while the Assyrians
whom he has summoned to his aid misunderstand him, and come up against
Jerusalem with hostile intent; they do not, indeed, carry the city, but
yet become possessors, without trouble, of its treasures, which the king
himself hands over to them (xxviii. 1-21).

The Book of Kings knows no worse ruler than Manasseh was; yet he reigned
undisturbed for fifty-five years—a longer period than was enjoyed by any
other king (2 Kings xxi. 1-18). This is a stone of stumbling that
Chronicles must remove. It tells that Manasseh was

<span id="page_207">p. 207</span>

carried in chains by the Assyrians to Babylon, but there prayed to
Jehovah, who restored him to his kingdom; he then abolished idolatry in
Judah (xxxiii. 11-20). Thus on the one hand he does not escape
punishment, while on the other hand the length of his reign is
nevertheless explained. Recently indeed it has been sought to support
the credibility of these statements by means of an Assyrian inscription,
from which it appears that Manasseh did pay tribute to Esarhaddon. That
is to say, he had been overpowered by the Assyrians; that is again to
say, that he had been thrown into chains and carried off by them. Not so
rapid, but perhaps quite as accurate, would be the inference that as a
tributary prince he must have kept his seat on the throne of Judah, and
not have exchanged it for the prison of Babylon. In truth, Manasseh's
temporary deposition is entirely on the same plane with Nebuchadnezzar's
temporary grass-eating. The unhistorical character of the intermezzo
(the motives of which are perfectly transparent) follows not only from
the silence of the Book of Kings (a circumstance of no small importance
indeed), but also, for example, from Jer. xv. 4; for when it is there
said that all Judah and Jerusalem are to be given up to destruction
because of Manasseh, it is not presupposed that his guilt has been
already borne and atoned for by himself.

To justify the fact of Josiah's defeat and death at Megiddo, there is
attached to him the blame of not having given heed to the words of Necho
from the mouth of God warning him against the struggle (xxxv. 21, 22).
Contrariwise, the punishment of the godless Jehoiakim is magnified; he
is stated to have been put in irons by the Chaldæans and carried to
Babylon (xxxvi. 6)—an impossibility of course before the capture of
Jerusalem, which did not take place until the third month of his
successor. The last prince of David's house, Zedekiah, having suffered
more severely than all his predecessors, must therefore have been
stiff-necked and rebellious (xxxvi. 12, 13),—characteristics to which,
according to the authentic evidence of the prophet Jeremiah, he had in
reality the least possible claim.

It is thus apparent how inventions of the most circumstantial kind have
arisen out of this plan of writing history, as it is euphemistically
called. One is hardly warranted, therefore, in taking the definiteness
of statements vouched for by Chronicles alone as proof of their
accuracy. The story about Zerah the Ethiopian (2 Chron. xiv. 9 seq.) is
just as apocryphal as that of Chushan-Rishathaim (Judges iii. 10).

<span id="page_208">p. 208</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Des Vignoles has
indeed identified the first-named with the Osorthon of Manetho, who
again occurs in the Egyptian monuments as Osorkon, son of Shishak,
though not as renewing the war against Palestine; but Osorkon was an
Egyptian, Zerah an Ethiopian, and the resemblance of the names is after
all not too obvious. But, even if Zerah were really a historical
personage, of what avail would this be for the unhistorical connection?
With a million of men the king of the Libyans and Moors, stepping over
Egypt, comes against Judah. Asa, ruler of a land of about sixty German
square miles, goes to meet the enemy with 580,000, and defeats him on
the plain to the north of Mareshah so effectually that not a single soul
survives. Shall it be said that this story, on account of the accurate
statement of locality (although Mareshah instead of Gath is not after
all suggestive of an old source), is credible-at all events after
deduction of the incredibilities? If the incredibilities are deducted,
nothing at all is left. The invasion of Judah by Baasha of Israel, and
Asa's deportment towards him (1 Kings xv. 17 seq.), are quite enough
fully to dispose of the great previous victory over the Ethiopians
claimed for Asa. The case is no better with the victory of Jehoshaphat
over the Ammonites and Moabites (2 Chron. xx.); here we have probably an
echo of 2 Kings iii., where we read of Jehoshaphat's taking part in a
campaign against Moab, and where also recurs that characteristic feature
of the self-destruction of the enemy, so that for the opposing force
nothing remains but the work of collecting the booty (iii. 23; compare 2
Chron. xx. 23). The Chronicler has enemies always at his command when
needed,—Arabians, Ethiopians (xvii. 11, xxi. 16, xxii. 1, xxvi. 7),
Mehunims (xx. 1, xxvi. 1), Philistines (xvii. 11, xxi. 16, xxvi. 6 seq.,
xxviii. 18), Ammonites (xx. 1, xxvi. 8, xxvii. 5), whose very names in
some cases put them out of the question for the older time. Such
statements as that the Ammonites became subject to Kings Uzziah and
Jotham, are, in the perfect silence of the credible sources, condemned
by their inherent impossibility; for at that period the highway to Ammon
was Moab, and this country was by no means then in the possession of
Judah, nor is it anywhere said that it was. The Philistines as
vindictive enemies are rendered necessary by the plan of the history
(xxi. 16, xxviii. 18), and this of itself throws suspicion upon the
previous statements (xvii. 11, xxvi. 6 seq.) that they were laid under
tribute by Jehoshaphat, and subjugated by Uzziah; it is utterly
impossible to believe that the latter should have broken down the

<span id="page_209">p. 209</span>

walls of Ashdod (Amos i. 7), or have established fortresses in
Philistia. According to the Book of Kings, he did indeed conquer Edom
anew; Edom is according to this authority the one land to which the
descendants of David lay claim and against which they wage war, while
Moab and Philistia (the most important towns being excepted, however, in
the case of the latter) virtually belong to the territory of Ephraim.

The triumphs given by the Chronicler to his favourites have none of them
any historical effect, but merely serve to add a momentary splendour to
their reigns. Merit is always the obverse of success. Joram, Joash,
Ahaz, who are all depicted as reprobates, build no fortresses, command
no great armies, have no wealth of wives and children; it is only in the
case of the pious kings (to the number of whom even Rehoboam and Abijah
also belong) that the blessing of God manifests itself by such tokens.
Power is the index of piety, with which accordingly It rises and fall.
Apart from this it is of no consequence if, for example, Jehoshaphat
possesses more than 1,100,000 soldiers (xvii, 14 seq.), for they are not
used for purposes of war; the victory comes from God and from the music
of the Levites (chap. xx.). In the statements about fortress-building
which regularly recur in connection with the names of good rulers, <span
id="fr_115"></span>[1](#fn_115.md) general statements, such as those of
Hosea viii. 14, 2 Kings xviii. 13, are illustrated by concrete examples,
a few elements of tradition being also employed (Lachish). It is not
possible, but, indeed, neither is it necessary, to demonstrate in every
case the imaginary character of the statements; according to xix. 5 it
would appear as if simply every city of any kind of consequence was
regarded as a fortress and in the list given in chap. xi. 6 seq., we
chiefly meet with names which were also familiar in the post-exile
period. That Abijah deprived Jeroboam of Bethel amongst others, and that
Jehoshaphat set governors over the Ephraimite cities which had been
taken by Asa his father (xiii. 19, xvii. 2), would excite surprise if it
stood anywhere else than in Chronicles. In forming a judgment on its
family history of the descendants of David, the statement contained in
xiii. 21 is specially helpful both in manner and substance: "And Abijah
waxed mighty, and he married fourteen wives, and begat twenty and two
sons, and sixteen daughters." This can only be taken as referring to the
reign of Abijah, and that too after the alleged victory

<span id="page_210">p. 210</span>

over Jeroboam; but he reigned altogether for only three years, and is it
to be supposed that within this interval one of his sons should even
have attained to man's estate? In reality, however, Abijah had no son at
all, but was succeeded by his brother, for the definite and doubtless
authentic statement that Maachah, the wife of Rehoboam, was the mother
both of Abijah and of Asa, and that the latter removed her from her
position at court (1 Kings xv. 2, 10, 13), must override the allegation
of ver. 8, that the successor of Abijah was his son. After Jehoshaphat's
death it is said in the first place that Jehoram slew all his brethren
(2 Chr. xxi. 4), and afterwards that the Arabians slew all Jehoram's
children with the exception of one (xxii. 1); how many of the Davidic
house in that case survive for Jehu, who nevertheless slew forty-two of
them (2 Kings x. 14)? In short, the family history of the house of David
is of equal historical value with all the other matters on which the
Chronicler is more widely and better informed than all the older
canonical books. The remark applies to names and numbers as well; about
such trifles, which produce an appearance of accuracy, the author is
never in any embarrassment.

4\. The Book of Kings then everywhere crops up as the real foundation of
the portion of Chronicles relating to Judah after the period of Solomon.
Where the narrative of the former is detailed and minute, our author
also has fuller and more interesting material at his command; so, for
example, in the history relating to the temple and to the common and
mutual relations of Judah and Israel (2 Chr. x., xviii., xxiii., seq.,
xxv. 17-24, xxxiii. seq.). Elsewhere he is restricted to the epitome
that constitutes the framework of the Book of Kings; by it he is guided
in his verdicts as to the general character of the successive sovereigns
as well as in his chronological statements, although, in accordance with
his plan, he as a rule omits the synchronisms (xiii. 1, xxv. 25). The
positive data also, given by the epitome with reference to the
legislation in matters of worship by the various kings, are for the most
part reproduced word for word, and float in a fragmentary and readily
distinguishable way in the mixture of festivals, sermons, choruses, law,
and prophets. For this is an important verification of all the results
already obtained; all in Chronicles that is not derived from Samuel and
Kings, has a uniform character not only in its substance, but also in
its awkward and frequently unintelligible language—plainly belonging to
a time in which Hebrew was approaching extinction—in its artificiality
of style, deriving

<span id="page_211">p. 211</span>

its vitality exclusively from Biblical reminiscences. This is not the
place for the proof of these points, but the reader may compare
Stähelin's *Emleitung* (1862), p. 139 seq.; Bertheau, p. xiv. seq., and
Graf, p. 116.

#### III.

1\. When the narrative of Chronicles runs parallel with the older
historical books of the canon, it makes no real additions, but the
tradition is merely differently coloured, under the influence of
contemporary motives. In the picture it gives the writer's own present
is reflected, not antiquity. But neither is the case very different with
the genealogical lists prefixed by way of introduction in 1 Chron.
i.-ix.; they also are in the main valid only for the period at which
they were drawn up—whether for its actual condition or for its
conceptions of the past.

The *penchant* for pedigrees and genealogical registers, made up from a
mixture of genealogico-historical and ethnologico-statistical elements,
is a characteristic feature of Judaism; along with the thing the word
‏יחש‎ also first came into use during the later times. Compendious
histories are written in the form of ‏תלדות‎ and ‏יוחשין‎. The thread is
thin and inconspicuous, and yet apparently strong and coherent; one does
not commit oneself to much, and yet has opportunity to introduce all
kinds of interesting matter. Material comes to one's hand, given a
beginning and an end, the bridge is soon completed. Another expression
of the same tendency is the inclination to give a genealogical
expression to all connections and associations of human society
whatsoever, to create artificial families on all hands and bring them
into blood relationship, as if the whole of public life resolved itself
into a matter of cousinship,—an inclination indicative of the times of
political stagnation then prevalent. We hear of the families of the
scribes at Jabesh, of the potters and gardeners and byssus-workers, of
the sons of the goldsmiths, apothecaries, and fullers, these
corporations being placed on the same plane with actual families. The
division into classes of the persons engaged in religious service is
merely the most logical development of this artificial system which is
applied to all other social relations as well.

Proceeding now to a fuller examination of the contents of 1 Chron.
i.-ix. and other texts connected with that, we have here, apart from the
first chapter, which does not demand further attention, an
ethno-genealogical

<span id="page_212">p. 212</span>

survey of the twelve tribes of Israel, which is based mostly on the data
of the Priestly Code (Gen. xlvi.; um. xxvi.), expanded now more now
less. But while the statements of the Priestly Code have to hold good
for the Mosaic period only, those of Chronicles have also to apply to
the succeeding ages,—those, for example, of Saul and David, of
Tiglath-Pileser and Hezekiah. As early as the time of the judges,
however, very important changes had taken place in the conditions. While
Dan continued to subsist with difficulty, Simeon and Levi had been
completely broken up (Gen. xlix. 7); in the Blessing of Moses the latter
name denotes something quite different from a tribe, and the former is
not even so much as named, although the enumeration is supposed to be
complete; in David's time it had already been absorbed by families of
mingled Judaic and Edomitic descent in the district where it had once
had independent footing. Eastward of Jordan Leah's first-born had a
similar fate, although somewhat later. After it has been deposed from
its primacy in Gen. xlix. and twitted in Judges v. with its brave words
unaccompanied by corresponding deeds, the faint and desponding wish is
expressed in Deut. xxxiii. 6 that "Reuben may live and not die," and
King Mesha is unaware that any other than the Gadite had ever dwelt in
the land which, properly speaking, was the heritage of Reuben. But in
Chronicles these extinct tribes again come to life—and not Levi alone,
which is a special case, but also Simeon and Reuben, with which alone we
are here to deal—and they exist as independent integral twelfths of
Israel, precisely like Ephraim and Manasseh, throughout the whole period
of the monarchy down to the destruction of the kingdom by the
Assyrians. <span id="fr_116"></span>[1](#fn_116.md) This is diametrically
opposed to all authentic tradition; for to maintain that nothing else is
intended than a continued subsistence of individual Simeonite and
Reubenite families within other tribes is merely a desperate resort of
the harmonists, and every attempt to tone down the fact that those
extinct and half-mythical tribes are in Chronicles placed side by side
with the rest without any distinction is equally illegitimate. The
historical value thus lost by the narrative as a whole cannot be
restored by the seeming truthfulness of certain details. Or is more

<span id="page_213">p. 213</span>

significance really to be attached to the wars of the Simeonites and
Reubenites against the Arabians than to the rest of the extemporised
wars of the kings of Judah against these children of the wilderness? If
only at least the names had not been "sons of Ham, and Mehunim and
Hagarenes" (iv. 40 seq. \[Heb.\], v. 10)! As for the pedigrees and
genealogical lists, are they to be accepted as historical merely because
their construction is not apparent to us, and they evade our criticism?
The language affords no room for the conjecture that we here possess
extracts from documents of high antiquity (iv. 33, 38, 41, v. 1 seq., 7,
9 seq.), and proper names such as Elioenai and the like (iv. 35 seq.)
are not striking for their antique originality.

Of the remaining tribes, so far as they belong to Israel and not to
Judah, the next in the series after Reuben are the trans-Jordanic (v.
11-26). They are said to have been numbered in the days of Jotham of
Judah and Jeroboam of Israel, on which occasion 44,760 warriors were
returned; they took the field against the Hagarenes, Ituræans,
Nephishites, and Nabatæans, gaining the victory and carrying off much
booty, "for they cried to God in the battle, and He was entreated of
them because they put their trust in Him." But afterwards they fell away
from the God of their fathers, and as a punishment were carried off by
Pul and Tiglath-Pileser to Armenia by the Chaboras and the river of
Gozan. Apart from the language, which in its edifying tone is that of
late Judaism, and leaving out of account the enumeration "the sons of
Reuben and the Gadites and half of the tribe of Manasseh," the
astonishing and highly doubtful combinations are eloquent: Pul and
Tiglath-Pileser, the Chaboras and the river of Gozan, are hardly
distinguished from each other; Jotham and Jeroboam, on the other hand,
make so impossible a synchronism that the partisans of Chronicles will
have it that none is intended,—forgetful, to be sure, of Hosea i. 2, and
omitting to say what in that case Jotham of Judah has to do here at all
in this connection. The Hagarenes and Ituræans too, instead of (say) the
Moabites and Ammonites, furnish food for reflection, as also do the
geographical statements that Gad had his seat in Bashan and Manasseh in
and near Lebanon. As for the proper names of families and their heads,
they are certainly beyond our means of judging; the phrases however of
the scheme they fill (anshe shemoth rashe l’beth abotham, migrash,
jaḥes) are peculiar to the Priestly Code and Chronicles, and alongside
of elements which are old and attested from other quarters,

<span id="page_214">p. 214</span>

occur others that look very recent, as for example (v. 24) Eliel,
Azriel, Jeremiah, Hodaviah, Jahdiel.

In the introduction the Galilæan tribes have no prominent place, but in
the rest of the book they make a favourable appearance (see especially 1
Chron. xii. 32-34, 40, and 2 Chron. xxx. 10, 11, 18); it readily occurs
to one, especially in the last-cited passage, to think of the later
Judaising process in Galilee. In Issachar there are stated to have been
87,000 fighting men in David's time (misparam l’toledotham l’beth
abotham, vii. 1-5); out of Zebulun and Naphtali, again, exactly 87,000
men came to David at Hebron, to anoint him and be feasted three days,—it
is carefully mentioned, however (xii. 40), that they took their
provisions up with them. The proper kernel of Israel, Ephraim and
Manasseh, is, in comparison with Simeon, Reuben, Gad, Issachar, treated
with very scant kindness (vii. 14-29),—a suspicious sign. The list of
the families of Manasseh is an artificial *réchauffé* of elements
gleaned anywhere; Maachah passes for the wife as well as the sister of
Machir, but being a Gileaditess (Beth-Maachah), ought not to have been
mentioned at all in this place where the cis-Jordanic Manasseh is being
spoken of; to fill up blanks every contribution is thankfully
received. <span id="fr_117"></span>[1](#fn_117.md) In the case of Ephraim a
long and meagre genealogy only is given, which, begun in vers. 20, 21,
and continued in ver. 25, constantly repeats the same names (Tahath,
Tahan, 1 Sam. i. 1; Eladah, Laadan, Shuthelah, Telah), and finally
reaches its end and goal in Joshua, whose father Nun alone is known to
the older sources! Into the genealogy a wonderful account of the slaying
of the children of Ephraim by the men of Gath (1 Sam. iv.?) has found
its way, and (like viii. 6, 7) according to the prevailing view must be
of venerable antiquity. But in that case the statement of iv. 9 must
also be very ancient, which yet obviously is connected with the rise of
the schools of the scribes stated in ii. 55 to have existed in Jabez.

Everywhere it is presupposed that Israel throughout the entire period of
the monarchy was organised on the basis of the twelve tribes (ii.-ix.;
xii.; xxvii.), but the assumption is certainly utterly false, as can be
seen for example from 1 Kings iv. Further, the *penchant* of later
Judaism for statistics is carried back to the earlier time, to which
surveys and censuses were repugnant in the extreme. In spite of 2 Sam.
xxiv., we are told that under David enumerations both of the spiritual
and of

<span id="page_215">p. 215</span>

the secular tribes were made again and again; so also under his
successors, as may be inferred partly from express statements and partly
from the precise statistics given as to the number of men capable of
bearing arms: in these cases the most astounding figures are set
down,—always, however, as resting on original documents and accurate
enumeration. In the statistical information of Chronicles, then, so far
as it relates to pre-exilic antiquity, we have to do with artificial
compositions. It is possible, and occasionally demonstrable, that in
these some elements derived from tradition have been used. But it is
certain that quite as many have been simply invented; and the
combination of the elements—the point of chief importance—dates, as both
form and matter show, from the very latest period. One might as well try
to hear the grass growing as attempt to derive from such a source as
this a historical knowledge of the conditions of ancient Israel.

2\. As regards Judah and Benjamin, and to a certain extent Levi also,
the case of course is somewhat different from that of the ten extinct
tribes. It is conceivable that here a living ethno-genealogical
tradition may have kept the present connected with the past.
Nevertheless, on closer examination, it comes out that most of what the
Chronicler here relates has reference to the post-exilic time, and that
the few fragments which go up to a higher antiquity are wrought into a
connection which on the whole is of a very recent date. Most obtrusively
striking is it that the list of the heads of the people dwelling in
Jerusalem given in ix. 4-17 is simply identical with Neh. xi. 3-19. In
this passage, introducing as it does the history of the kings (x. seq.),
one is by no means prepared to hear statements about the community of
the second temple; but our author is under the impression that in going
there he is letting us know about the old Jerusalem; from David to
Nehemiah is no leap for him, the times are not distinct from one another
to his mind. For chap. viii. also, containing a full enumeration of the
Benjamite families, with special reference to those which had their seat
in the capital, Bertheau has proved the post-exilic reference; it is
interesting that in the later Jerusalem there existed a widespread
family which wished to deduce its origin from Saul and rested its claims
to this descent on a long genealogy (viii. 33-40). <span
id="fr_118"></span>[1](#fn_118.md) It cannot be said that this produces a
very favourable impression for the high antiquity of the other list of
the Benjamites in vii. 6-11; to see how little value is to be attached
to the pretensions of the latter

<span id="page_216">p. 216</span>

to be derived from original documents of hoary antiquity, it is only
necessary to notice the genuinely Jewish phraseology of vers. 7, 9, 11,
such proper names as Elioenai, and the numbers given (22,034 + 20,200 +
17,200, making in all 59,434 fighting men).

The registers of greatest historical value are those relating to the
tribe of Judah (ii. 1-iv. 23). But in this statement the genealogy of
the descendants of David must be excepted (chapter iii.), the interest
of which begins only with Zerubbabel, the rest being merely an
exceedingly poor compilation of materials still accessible to us in the
older historical books of the canon, and in Jeremiah. According to iii.
5, the first four of David's sons, born in Jerusalem, were all children
of Bathsheba; the remaining seven are increased to nine by a textual
error which occurs also in the LXX version of 2 Sam. v. 16. Among the
sons of Josiah (iii. 15 seq.), Johanan, *i.e.* Jehoahaz, is
distinguished from Shallum (Jer. xxii. 11), and because he immediately
succeeded his father, is represented as the first-born, though in truth
Jehoiakim was older (2 Kings xxiii. 31, 36); Zedekiah, Jehoiakim's
brother, is given out to be the son of Jeconiah, the son of Jehoiakim,
because he was the successor of Jeconiah, who succeeded Jehoiakim.
Similar things occur also in the Book of Daniel, but are usually
overlooked, with a mistaken piety. Whoever has eyes to see cannot assign
any high value except to the two great Jewish genealogies in chaps. ii.
and iv. Yet even here the most heterogeneous elements are tossed
together, and chaff is found mingled with wheat. <span
id="fr_119"></span>[1](#fn_119.md)

Apart from the introduction, vers. 1-8, chap. ii. is a genealogy of the
children of Hezron, a tribe which in David's time had not yet been
wholly amalgamated with Judah, but which even then constituted the real
strength of that tribe and afterwards became completely one with it. The
following scheme discloses itself amid the accompanying matters: "The
sons of Hezron are Jerahmeel and Celubai" (Caleb) (ver. 9). "and the
sons of Jerahmeel, the first-born of Hezron, were. . ." (ver. 25).
"These were the sons of Jerahmeel. And the sons of Caleb the brother of
Jerahmeel were. . ." (ver. 42). "These were the sons of Caleb" (ver. 50
*a*). That which is thus formally defined and kept by itself apart
(compare in this connection "Jerahmeel the first-born of Hezron," "Caleb
the brother of Jerahmeel") is materially also distinguished from

<span id="page_217">p. 217</span>

all else. It is the kernel of the whole, and refers to the pre-exilian
time. Even the unusual *et fuerunt* (vers. 25, 33, 50) points to this
conclusion, as well as, in the case of Caleb, the positive fact that the
towns named in ver. 42-49 are all situated near Hebron and in the Negeb
of Judah, where after the exile the Idumæans were settled, and, in the
case of Jerahmeel, the negative circumstance that here no towns at all
are mentioned among the families, Molid, ver. 29, being perhaps a single
exception, and thus the extreme south is indicated. But this kernel is
amplified by a number of post-exilian additions. In the first place, in
connection with Jerahmeel, an appendix (vers. 34-41) is given which is
not ethnological but purely genealogical, and brings a pedigree of
fifteen members manifestly down to near the age of the Chronicler, and
which moreover is only in apparent connection with what precedes it
(comp. ver. 34 with ver. 31), and invariably uses the hiphil form
*holid*, a form which occurs in vers. 25-33 never, and in vers. 42-50
only sporadically in three places open to the suspicion of later
redaction (comp. especially ver. 47). Much more important, however, are
the additions under Caleb; of these the one is prefixed (vers. 18-24),
the other, more appropriately, brought in at the close (vers. 50-55,
beginning with "and the sons of Hur, the firstborn of Ephrath," Caleb's
second wife, ver. 19). Here Caleb no longer presents himself in the
extreme south of Judah and the vicinity of Jerahmeel (1 Samuel xxv. 3,
xxvii. 10, xxx. 14, 29), where he had his settlement prior to the exile,
but his families, which are all of them descended from his son Hur,
inhabit Bethlehem, Kirjath-jearim, Zorah, Esthaol, and other towns in
the north, frequently mentioned in Ezra and Nehemiah. Thus the Calebites
in consequence of the exile have forsaken their old seats and have taken
up new ones on their return; this fact is expressed in ver. 18 to the
effect that Caleb's first wife Azubah bath Jerioth (Deserta filia
Nomadum) had died, and that he had then married a second, Ephrath, by
whom he became the father of Hur: Ephrath is the name of the district in
which Bethlehem and Kirjath-jearim are situated, and properly speaking
is merely another form of Ephraim, as is shown by the word Ephrathite.
In addition to these appendices to Jerahmeel and Caleb, we have also the
genealogy of David (vers. 10-17). The Book of Samuel knows only of his
father Jesse; on the other hand, Saul's genealogy is carried further
back, and there was no reason for not doing so in David's case also if
the materials had existed. But here, as in Ruth, the pedigree is traced
backwards

<span id="page_218">p. 218</span>

through Jesse, Obed, Boaz, up to Salma. Salma is the father of Bethlehem
(ii. 54), and hence the father of David. But Salma is the father of
Bethlehem and the neighbouring towns or fractions of towns *after the
exile;* he belongs to Kaleb Abi Hur. <span
id="fr_120"></span>[1](#fn_120.md) But if anything at all is certain, it is
this, that in ancient times the Calebites lived in the south and not in
the north of Judah, and in particular that David by his nativity
belonged not to them but rather to the older portion of Judah which
gravitated towards Israel properly so called, and stood in most intimate
relations with Benjamin. Of the first three members of the genealogy,
Nahshon and Amminadab occur as princes of Judah in the Priestly Code,
and are fitly regarded as the ancestors of those who come after them;
Ram is the first-born of Hezron's first-born (ver. 25), and by the
meaning of his name also (Ram = the high one), is, like Abram, qualified
to stand at the head of the princely line.

While in chap ii. we thus in point of fact fall in with an old kernel,
and one that necessarily goes back to sound tradition (apparently
preserved indeed, however, merely for the sake of the later additions),
the quite independent and parallel list, on the other hand, contained in
iv. 1-23 is shown by many unmistakable indications to be a later
composition having its reference only to post-exilian conditions,
perhaps incorporating a few older elements, which, however, it is
impossible with any certainty to detect. <span
id="fr_121"></span>[2](#fn_121.md)

Levi of course receives the fullest treatment (1 Chron. v. 27 \[vi.
1\]-vi. 66 \[81\], ix. 10 seq., xv., xvi., xxiii.-xxvii., &c.). We know
that this clerical tribe is an artificial production, and that its
hierarchical subdivision, as worked out in the Priestly Code, was the
result of the centralisation of the cultus in Jerusalem. Further, it has
been already shown that in the history as recorded in Chronicles the
effort is most conspicuous to

<span id="page_219">p. 219</span>

represent the sons of Aaron and the Levites, in all cases where they are
absent from the older historical books of the canon, as playing the part
to which they are entitled according to the Priestly Code. How immediate
is the connection with the last-named document, how in a certain sense
that code is even carried further by Chronicles, can be seen for example
from this circumstance, that in the former Moses in a novel reduces the
period of beginning public service in the case of a Levite from thirty
years of age to twenty-five (Num. iv. 3 seq., viii. 23 seq.), while in
the latter David (1 Chron. xxiii. 3, 24 seq.) brings it down still
further to the age of twenty; matters are still to some extent in a
state of flux, and the ordering of the temple worship is a continuation
of the beginning made with the tabernacle service by Moses. Now, in so
far as the statistics of the clergy have a real basis at all, that basis
is post-exilian. It has long ago been remarked how many of the
individuals figuring under David and his successors (*e.g.*, Asaph,
Heman, Jeduthun) bear names identical with families or guilds of a later
time, how the two indeed are constantly becoming confluent, and
difficulty is felt in determining whether by the expression "head" a
person or a family ought to be understood. But, inasmuch as the
Chronicler nevertheless desires to depict the older time and not his
own, he by no means adheres closely to contemporary statistics, but
gives free play at the same time to his idealising imagination; whence
it comes that in spite of the numerous and apparently precise data
afforded, the reader still finds himself unable to form any clear
picture of the organisation of the clergy,—the ordering of the families
and tribes, the distribution of the offices,—nay, rather, is involved in
a maze of contradictions. Obededom, Jeduthun, Shelomith, Korah, occur in
the most different connections, belong now to one, now to another
section of the Levites, and discharge at one time this function, at
another, that. Naturally the commentators are prompt with their help by
distinguishing names that are alike, and identifying names that are
different.

Some characteristic details may still be mentioned here. The names of
the six Levitical classes according to 1 Chron. xxv. 4, Giddalti,
V’romamti-Ezer, Joshbekashah, Mallothi, Hothir, Mahazioth, are simply
the fragments of a consecutive sentence which runs: I have magnified \|
and exalted the help \| of him who sat in need: \| I have spoken \|
abundance of \| prophecies. The watchman or singer Obededom who is
alleged to have discharged his functions in the days of

<span id="page_220">p. 220</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> David and Amaziah,
is no other than the captain to whom David intrusted for three months
the custody of the ark, a Philistine of Gath. The composition of the
singers’ pedigrees is very transparent, especially in the case of Heman
(1 Chron. vi. 7-l2 \[22-27\] = ver. 18-23, \[33-37\]). Apart from Exod.
vi. 16-19, use is chiefly made of what is said about the family of
Samuel (1 Sam. i. 1, viii. 2), who must of course have been of Levitical
descent, because his mother consecrated him to the service of the
sanctuary. Heman is the son of Joel b. Samuel b. Elkanah b. Jeroham b.
Eliab b. Tahath b. Zuph, only the line does not terminate with Ephraim
as in 1 Sam. i. 1 (LXX) because it is Levi who is the goal; Zuph.
however, is an Ephraitic district, and Tahath (Tohu, Toah, Tahan,
Nahath) is an Ephraimite family (vii. 20). Further back the same
elements are individually repeated more than once, Elkanah four times in
all; he occurs once as early as in Exod. vi. 24, where also he is
doubtless borrowed from 1 Samuel i. The best of it is that, contrary to
the scope of the genealogies recorded in 1 Chron. vi., which is to
provide a Levitical origin for the guilds of singers, there is found in
close contiguity the statement (ii. 6) that Heman and Ethan were
descendants of Zerah b. Pharez, b. *Judah*. The commentators are indeed
assisted in their efforts to differentiate the homonyms by their
ignorance of the fact that even as late as Nehemiah's time the singers
did not yet pass for Levites, but their endeavours are wrecked by the
circumstance that the names of fathers as well as of sons are identical
(Ps. lxxxviii. 1, lxxxix. 1; Ewald, iii. 380 seq.). In point of history
these musicians of the second temple are descended of course neither
from Levi nor from the sons of Mahol (1 Kings v. 11 \[iv. 31), but they
have at least derived their names from the latter. On all hands we meet
with such artificial names in the case of Levites. One is called
Issachar; it would not be surprising to meet with a Naphtali Çebi, or
Judah b. Jacob. Jeduthun is, properly speaking, the name of a tune or
musical mode (Ps. xxxix. 1, lxii. 1, lxxvii. 1), whence also of a choir
trained in that. Particularly interesting are a few pagan names, as for
example Henadad, Bakbuk, and some others, which, originally borne by the
temple servitors (Neh. vii. 46 seq.), were doubtless transferred along
with these to the Levites.

With the priests, of whom so many are named at all periods of the
history of Israel, matters are no better than with the inferior Levites,
so far as the Books of Samuel and Kings are not drawn upon. In
particular, the twenty-four priestly courses or orders are an
institution, not

<span id="page_221">p. 221</span>

of King David, but of the post-exilic period. When Hitzig, annotating
Ezek. viii. 16, remarks that the five-and-twenty men standing between
the temple and the altar worshipping the sun toward the east are the
heads of the twenty-four priestly courses with the high priest at their
head (because no one else had the right to stand in the inner court
between temple and altar), he reveals a trait that is characteristic,
not only of himself, but also of the entire so-called historico-critical
school, who exert their whole subtlety on case after case, but never
give themselves time to think matters over in their connection with each
other; nay, rather simply retain the traditional view as a whole, only
allowing themselves by way of gratification a number of heresies. It is
almost impossible to believe that Hitzig, when he annotated Ezek. viii.,
could have read those passages Ezekiel xliii. 7 seq., xliv. 6 seq., from
which it is most unambiguously clear that the later exclusion of the
laity from the sanctuary was quite unknown in the pre-exilic period. The
extent of the Chronicler's knowledge about the pre-exilic priesthood is
revealed most clearly in the list of the twenty-two high priests in 1
Chron. v. 29-41 (vi. 3-15). From the ninth to the eighteenth the series
runs—Amariah, Ahitub, Zadok, Ahimaaz, Azariah, Johanan, Azariah,
Amariah, Ahitub, Zadok. As for the first five, Azariah was not the son,
but the brother of Ahimaaz, and the latter apparently not a priest (1
Kings iv. 2); but Ahitub, the alleged father of Zadok, was, on the
contrary, the grandfather of Zadok's rival, Abiathar, of the family of
Eli (1 Sam. xiv. 3, xxii. 20); the whole of the old and famous line—Eli,
Phinehas, Ahitub; Ahimelech, Abiathar—which held the priesthood of the
ark from the time of the judges down into the days of David, is passed
over in absolute silence, and the line of Zadok, by which it was not
superseded until Solomon (1 Kings ii. 35), is represented as having held
the leadership of the priesthood since Moses. As for the last four in
the above-cited list, they simply repeat the earlier. In the Book of
Kings, Azariah II., Amariah, Ahitub, Zadok, do not occur, but, on the
contrary, other contemporary high priests, Jehoiada and Urijah, omitted
from the enumeration in Chronicles. At the same time this enumeration
cannot be asserted to be defective; for, according to Jewish chronology,
the ancient history is divided into two periods, each of 480 years, the
one extending from the exodus to the building of the temple, the other
from that epoch down to the establishment of the second theocracy. Now,
480 years are twelve generations of forty years, and in 1 Chron. v.
there

<span id="page_222">p. 222</span>

are twelve high priests reckoned to the period during which there was no
temple (ver. 36*b* to come after ver. 35*a*), and thence eleven down to
the exile; that is to say, twelve generations, when the exile is
included. The historical value of the genealogy in 1 Chron. v. 26-41 is
thus inevitably condemned. But if Chronicles knew nothing about the
priestly princes of the olden time, its statements about ordinary
priests are obviously little to be relied on.

3\. To speak of a tradition handed down from pre-exilic times as being
found in Chronicles, either in 1 Chron. i.-ix. or in 1 Chron. x.-2
Chron. xxxvi., is thus manifestly out of the question. As early as 1806
this had been conclusively shown by the youthful De Wette (then
twenty-six years of age). But since that date many a theological
Sisyphus has toiled to roll the stone again wholly or half-way up the
hill—Movers especially, in genius it might seem the superior of the
sober Protestant critic—with peculiar results. This scholar mixed up the
inquiry into the historical value of those statements in Chronicles
which we are able to control, with the other question as to the probable
sources of its variations from the older historical books of the canon.
In vain had De Wette, at the outset, protested against such a procedure,
contending that it was not only possible, but conceded that Chronicles,
where at variance or in contradiction, was following older authority,
but that the problem still really was, as before, how to explain the
complete difference of general conception and the multitude of
discrepancies in details; that the hypothesis of "sources," as held
before Movers by Eichhorn, was of no service in dealing with this
question, and that in the critical comparison of the two narratives, and
in testing their historical character, it was after all incumbent to
stick to what lay before one (*Beitr.*, i. pp. 24, 29, 38). For so
ingenious an age such principles were too obvious; Movers produced a
great impression, especially as he was not so simple as to treat the
letters of Hiram and Elijah as authentic documents, but was by way of
being very critical. At present even Dillmann also unfortunately
perceives "that the Chronicler everywhere has worked according to
sources, and that in his case deliberate invention or distortion of the
history are not for a moment to be spoken of" (Herzog, *Realencyk.*, ii.
p. 693, 1st edit.; iii. 223, 2d edit.). And from the lofty heights of
science the author of Part V. of the *Biblical Commentary on the Old
Testament* looks compassionately down upon K. H. Graf, "who has loitered
so far behind the march of Old Testament research, as

<span id="page_223">p. 223</span>

to have thought of resuscitating the views of De Wette;" in fact, that
Chronicles may be established on an independent footing and placed on a
level with the Books of Samuel and Kings, he utterly denies any
indebtedness at all, on its part, to these, and in cases where the
transcription is word for word, maintains that separate independent
sources were made use of,—a needless exaggeration of the scientific
spirit, for the author of the Book of Kings himself wrote the prayer of
Solomon and the epitome, at least, without borrowing from another
source; the Chronicler therefore can have derived it, directly or
indirectly, only from him.

In reply to all this, one can only repeat what has already been said by
De Wette. It may be that the Chronicler has produced this picture of old
Israel, so different in outline and colour from the genuine tradition,
not of his own suggestion and on his own responsibility, but on the
ground of documents that lay before him. But the historical character of
the work is not hereby altered in the smallest degree, it is merely
shared by the so-called "sources." 2 Maccabees and a multitude of other
compositions have also made use of "sources," but how does this enhance
the value of their statements? That value must in the long run be
estimated according to their contents, which, again, must be judged, not
by means of the primary sources which have been lost, but by means of
the secondary literary products which have survived. The whole question
ultimately resolves itself into that of historical credibility; and to
what conclusions this leads we have already seen. The alterations and
additions of Chronicles are all traceable to the same fountain-head—the
Judaising of the past, in which otherwise the people of that day would
have been unable to recognise their ideal. It was not because tradition
gave the Law and the hierocracy and the *Deus ex Machina* as sole
efficient factor in the sacred narrative, but because these elements
were felt to be missing, that they were thus introduced. If we are to
explain the *omissions* by reference to the "author's plan," why may we
not apply the same principle to the *additions?* The passion displayed
by Ewald (*Jahrbb.* x. 261) when, in speaking of the view that
Manasseh's captivity has its basis in Jewish dogmatic, he calls it "an
absurdly infelicitous idea, and a gross injustice besides to the Book of
Chronicles," recalls B. Schaefer's suggestive remark about the
*Preacher* of Solomon, that God would not use a liar to write a
canonical book. What then does Ewald say to the narratives of Daniel or
Jonah?

<span id="page_224">p. 224</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Why must the new
turn given to history in the case of Manasseh be judged by a different
standard than in the equally gross case of Ahaz, and in the numerous
analogous instances enumerated in preceding pages (p. 203 seq.). With
what show of justice can the Chronicler, after his statements have over
and over again been shown to be incredible, be held at discretion to
pass for an unimpeachable narrator? In those cases at least where its
connection with his "plan" is obvious, one ought surely to exercise some
scepticism in regard to his testimony; but it ought at the same time to
be considered that such connections may occur much oftener than is
discernible by us, or at least by the less sharp-sighted of us. It is
indeed possible that occasionally a grain of good corn may occur among
the chaff, but to be conscientious one must neglect this possibility of
exceptions, and give due honour to the probability of the rule. For it
is only too easy to deceive oneself in thinking that one has come upon
some sound particular in a tainted whole. To what is said in 2 Sam. v.
9, "So David dwelt in the stronghold (Jebus), and he called it the city
of David, and he built round about from the rampart and inward," there
is added in 1 Chron. xi. 8, the statement that "Joab restored the rest
of the city (Jerusalem)." This looks innocent enough, and is generally
accepted as a fact. But the word ‏חיה‎ for ‏בנה‎ shows the comparatively
modern date of the statement, and on closer consideration one remembers
also that the town of Jebus at the time of its conquest by David
consisted only of the citadel, and the new town did not come into
existence at all until later, and therefore could not have been repaired
by Joab; in what interest the statement was made can be gathered from
Neh. vii. 11. In many cases it is usual to regard such additions as
having had their origin in a better text of Samuel and Kings which lay
before the Chronicler; and this certainly is the most likely way in
which good additions could have got in. But the textual critics of the
*Exegetical Handbook* are only too like-minded with the Chronicler, and
are always eagerly seizing with both hands his paste pearls and the
similar gifts of the Septuagint.

It must be allowed that Chronicles owes its origin, not to the arbitrary
caprice of an individual, but to a general tendency of its period. It is
the inevitable product of the conviction that the Mosaic law is the
starting-point of Israel's history, and that in it these is operative a
play of sacred forces such as finds no other analogy; this conviction
could not but lead to a complete transformation of the ancient
tradition.

<span id="page_225">p. 225</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Starting from a
similar assumption, such an author as C. F. Keil could even at the
present day write a book of Chronicles, if this were not already in
existence. Now, in this aspect, for the purpose of appraising Chronicles
as the type of that conception of history which the scribes cherished,
the inquiry into its "sources" is really important and interesting.
References to other writings, from which further particulars can be
learned, are appended as a rule, to the account of each sovereign's
reign, the exceptions being in the cases of Joram, Ahaziah, Athaliah,
Amon, Jehoahaz, Jehoiakim, Zedekiah. The titles referred to in this way
may be classed under two groups: (1.) The Book of the Kings of Israel
and Judah, or of Judah and Israel (in the cases of Asa, Amaziah, Jotham;
Ahaz, Josiah, and Jehoiakim), with which the Book of the Kings of Israel
(in the cases of Jehoshaphat and Manasseh; comp. 1 Chron. ix. 1) is
identical, for the kingdom of the ten tribes is not reckoned by the
Chronicler. (2.) The Words of Samuel the Seer, Nathan the Prophet, and
Gad the Seer (for David; 1 Chron. xxix. 29; comp. xxvii. 24; Ecclus.
xlvi. 13, xlvii. 1); the Words of Nathan the Prophet, the Prophecy of
Ahijah of Shiloh and the Vision of Iddo the Seer concerning Jeroboam ben
Nebat (for Solomon; 2 Chron. ix. 29); the Words of Shemaiah the Prophet
and Iddo the Seer (for Rehoboam; xii. 15); the words of Jehu ben Hanani,
which are taken over into the Book of the Kings of Israel (Jehoshaphat;
xx. 34); a writing of Isaiah the prophet (Uzziah; xxvi. 22), more
precisely cited as the Vision of Isaiah the Prophet, the son of Amoz, in
the Book of the Kings of Judah and Israel (Hezekiah; xxxii. 32); the
Words of the Seer in the Book of the Kings of Israel (Manasseh; xxxiii.
18; comp. also ver. 19). Following in the footsteps of Movers, Bertheau
and others have shown that under these different citations it is always
one and the same book that is intended, whether by its collective title,
or by the conventional sub-titles of its separate sections. <span
id="fr_122"></span>[1](#fn_122.md) Bertheau calls attention to the fact
that ordinarily it is either the one or the other title that is given,
and when, as is less usual, there are two, then for the most part the
prophetic writing is designated as a portion of the Book of the Kings of
Israel (xx. 34, xxxii. 32; and, quite vaguely, xxxiii. 18). The peculiar
mode

<span id="page_226">p. 226</span>

of naming the individual section <span
id="fr_123"></span>[1](#fn_123.md)—at a time when chapters and verses were
unknown—has its origin in the idea that each period of the sacred
history has its leading prophet (ἀκριβὴς τῶν προφητῶν διαδοχή; Jos., *c.
Ap.* i. 8), but also at the same time involves (according to xxvi. 22,
in spite of ix. 29, xii. 15, xiii. 22; 1 Chron. xxix. 29) the notion
that each prophet has himself written the history of his own period.
Obviously, this is the explanation of the title *prophetæ priores* borne
by the Books of Joshua, Judges, Samuel, and Kings in the Jewish canon,
and of the view which led to the introduction of 2 Kings xviii. 18 seq.
into the Book of Isaiah. The claims of history being slight, it was easy
to find the needful *propheta eponymus* for each section. Jehu ben
Hanani, a northern Israelite of Baasha's time, has to do duty for Asa,
and also for Jehoshaphat as well. Iddo the seer, who prophesied against
Jeroboam ben Nebat, is the anonymous prophet of 1 Kings xiii. (Jos.,
*Ant.* viii. 8, 5; Jer. on Zach. i. 1); by this time it was possible,
also, to give the names of the wives of Cain, and of the patriarchs.

As regards a more definite determination of the date of the "Book of
Kings" which lies at the foundation of Chronicles, a co-ordination of
the two series of the Kings of Israel and Judah can only have been made
after both had been brought to a close; in other words, not before the
Babylonian exile. And in the Babylonian exile it was that the canonical
Book of Kings actually came into existence, and the "Chronicles" of
Israel and those of Judah were for the first time worked together by its
author; at least he refers only to the separate works and knows of no
previous combination of them. It would seem, therefore, very natural to
identify the work alluded to in Chronicles with our present canonical
book, which is similar in title and has corresponding contents. But this
we cannot do, for in the former there were matters of which there are in
the latter no trace; for example, according to 1 Chron. ix. 1, it
contained family and numerical statistics for the whole of Israel after
the manner of 1 Chron. i.-ix. (chapters for the most part borrowed from
it) and according to 1 Chron. xxxiii 19, the Prayer of Manasseh. From
these two data, as well as from the character of the items of
information which may have been conjectured to have been derived from
this source, the conclusion is forced upon us that the Book of Kings
cited by the Chronicler is a late compilation far removed from actual
tradition, and

<span id="page_227">p. 227</span>

in relation to the canonical Book of Kings it can only be explained as
an apocryphal amplification after the manner in which the scribes
treated the sacred history. This conclusion, derived from the contents
themselves, is supported by an important positive datum, namely, the
citation in 2 Chron. xxiv. 27 of the *Midrash* \[A.V. "Story"\] of the
Book of Kings, and in xiii. 22 of the *Midrash* of the prophet Iddo.
Ewald is undoubtedly right when he recognises here the true title of the
writing elsewhere named simply the Book of Kings. Of course the
commentators assert that the word *Midrash*, which occurs in the Bible
only in these two passages, there means something quite different from
what it means everywhere else; but the natural sense suits admirably
well and in Chronicles we find ourselves fully within the period of the
scribes. *Midrash* is the consequence of the conservation of all the
relics of antiquity, a wholly peculiar artificial reawakening of dry
bones, especially by literary means, as is shown by the preference for
lists of names and numbers. Like ivy it overspreads the dead trunk with
extraneous life, blending old and new in a strange combination. It is a
high estimate of tradition that leads to its being thus modernised; but
in the process it is twisted and perverted, and set off with foreign
accretions in the most arbitrary way. Jonah as well as Daniel and a
multitude of apocryphal writings (2 Macc. ii. 13) are connected with
this tendency to cast the reflection of the present back into the past;
the Prayer of Manasseh, which now survives only in Greek, appears, as
Ewald has conjectured, actually to have been taken direct from the book
quoted in 2 Chron. xxxiii. 19. Within this sphere, wherein all Judaism
moves, Chronicles also has had its rise. Thus whether one says
Chronicles or *Midrash* of the Book of Kings is on the whole a matter of
perfect indifference; they are children of the same mother, and
indistinguishable in spirit and language, while on the other hand the
portions which have been retained verbatim from the canonical Book of
Kings at once betray themselves in both respects.

<span id="fn_109"></span>[173:1](phai09.htm#fr_109.md) The division into a
group of three and another of thirty heroes, obscured in 2 Sam. xxiii.
by corruption of the text (*Text der Bb. Sam.* p. 213-216), has not been
understood by the Chronicler, and thus been made quite unrecognisable.
In this way he has been able to bring in at the end (xi. 42-47) a string
of additional names exceeding the number of thirty. In ver. 42 his style
unmistakably betrays itself, wherever it may be that he met with the
elements.

indeed is unable, even in the case of these schismatics, to divest
himself of his legal notions, as appears almost comically in the
circumstance that the priests of Jeroboam set about their heretical
practices quite in accordance with the prescriptions of the Priestly
Code, and procure their consecration by means of a great sacrifice (2

Caleb's kindred the Kenites are designated as Salmæans; the name also
occurs in Canticles (i. 5, the tents of Kedar, the curtains of Salmah),
and also as the name of a Nabatæan tribe in Pliny. Among the families of
the Nethinim enumerated in Nehemiah vii. 46-60 the B’ne Salmah also
occur, along with several other names which enable us distinctly to
recognise (Ezek. xliv.) the non-Israelite and foreign origin of these
temple slaves; see, for example, vers. 48, 52, 55, 57.

<span id="fn_121"></span>[218:2](phai09.htm#fr_121.md) Pharez, Hezron,
Carmi, Hur, Shobal (iv. 1), is a genealogically descending series;
Chelubai must therefore of necessity be read instead of Carmi, all the
more because Chelub and not Carmi appears in the third place in the
subsequent expansion; for this, ascending from below, begins with Shobal
(ver. 2), then goes on to Hur (vers. 5-10), who stands in the same
relation to Ash-hur as Tob to Ish-tob, and finally deals with Chelub or
Caleb (vers. 11-15).

<span id="fn_122"></span>[225:1](phai09.htm#fr_122.md) In Ezra and Nehemiah
also the Chronicler has not used so many sources as are usually
supposed. There is no reason for refusing to identify the "lamentations"
of 2 Chron. xxxv. 25, with our Lamentations of Jeremiah: at least the
reference to the death of Josiah (Jos., *Ant.* x. 5, 1), erroneously
attributed to them, ought not in candour to be regarded as such.
