### 3. *THE FOUNDATION OF THE KINGDOM, AND THE FIRST THREE KINGS*.

<span class="smallcaps">The</span> Philistines were the means of
arousing from their slumber Israel and Jehovah. From their settlements
by the sea on the low-lying plain which skirts the mountains of Judah on
the west, they pressed northwards into the plain of Sharon, and thence
into the plain of Jezreel beyond, which is connected with that of Sharon
by the upland valley of Dothan. Here, having driven out the Danites,
they came into direct contact with the tribe of Joseph, the chief
bulwark of Israel, and a great battle took place at Aphek, where the
plain of Sharon merges into the valley of Dothan. The Philistines were
victorious and carried off as a trophy the Israelite standard, the ark
of Jehovah. Their further conquests included, not only the plain of
Jezreel and the hill country bordering it on the south, but also the
proper citadel of the country, "Mount Ephraim." The old sanctuary at
Shiloh was destroyed by them; its temple of Jehovah thenceforward lay in
ruins. Their supremacy extended as far as to Benjamin; the Philistines
had a *neçib* in Gibeah. <span id="fr_247"></span>[1](#fn_247.md) But the
assertion that they had confiscated all weapons and removed all smiths
must be regarded as an unhistorical exaggeration; under their régime at
all events it was possible for the messengers of a beleaguered city on
the east of Jordan to summon their countrymen in the west to their
relief.

<span id="page_449">p. 449</span>

The shame of the Israelites under the reproach of Philistine oppression
led, in the first instance, to a widespread exaltation of religious
feeling. Troops of ecstatic enthusiasts showed themselves here and
there, and went about with musical accompaniments in processions which
often took the shape of wild dances; even men of the most sedate
temperament were sometimes smitten with the contagion, and drawn into
the charmed circle. In such a phenomenon, occurring in the East, there
was nothing intrinsically strange; among the Canaanites, such
"Nebiim"—for so they were styled—had long been familiar, and they
continued to exist in the country after the old fashion, long after
their original character, so far as Israel was concerned, had been
wholly lost. The new thing at this juncture was that this spirit passed
over upon Israel, and that the best members of the community were seized
by it. It afforded an outlet for the suppressed excitement of the
nation.

The new-kindled zeal had for its object, not the abolition of Baal
worship, but resistance to the enemies of Israel. Religion and
patriotism were then identical. This spirit of the times was understood
by an old man, Samuel ben Elkanah, who lived at Ramah in south-western
Ephraim. He was not himself one of the Nebiim; on the contrary, he was a
seer of that old type which had for a long time existed amongst the
Hebrews much as we find it amongst the Greeks or Arabs. Raised by his
foreseeing talent to a position of great prominence, he found
opportunity to occupy himself with other questions besides those which
he was professionally called on to answer. The national distress weighed
upon his heart; the neighbouring peoples had taught him to recognise the
advantages which are secured by the consolidation of families and tribes
into a kingdom. But Samuel's peculiar merit lay, not in discovering what
it was that the nation needed, but in finding out the man who was
capable of supplying that need. Having come to know Saul ben Kish, a
Benjamite of the town of Gibeah, a man of gigantic form, and swift,
enthusiastic nature, he declared to him his destiny to become king over
Israel.

Saul very soon had an opportunity for showing whether Samuel had been a
true seer or no. The city of Jabesh in Gilead was besieged by the
Ammonites, and the inhabitants declared themselves ready to surrender
should they fail in obtaining speedy succour from their countrymen.
Their messengers had passed through all Israel without

<span id="page_450">p. 450</span>

meeting with anything more helpful than pity, until at last tidings of
their case reached Saul as he was returning with a yoke of oxen from the
field. Hewing his cattle in pieces, he caused the portions to be sent in
all directions, with the threat that so should it be done with the oxen
of every one who should refuse to help in relieving Jabesh. The people
obeyed the summons, fell suddenly one morning upon the Ammonites, and
delivered the beleaguered city.

Having thus found Saul the man for their need, they refused to let him
go. In Gilgal, Joshua's old camp, they anointed him king. The act was
equivalent to imposing upon him the conduct of the struggle against the
Philistines, and so he understood it. The first signal for the attack
was given by his son Jonathan, when he slew the *neçib* of the
Philistines at Gibeah. These in consequence advanced in force towards
the focus of the revolt, and took up a position opposite Gibeah on the
north, being divided from it only by the gorge of Michmash. Only a few
hundred Benjamites ventured to remain with Saul. The struggle opened
with a piece of genuine old heroic daring. While the Philistines were
dispersed over the country in foraging expeditions, Jonathan,
accompanied by his armour-bearer only, and without the knowledge of
Saul, made an attack upon the weak post which they had left behind at
the pass of Michmash. After the first had been surprised and
overmastered, the others took to flight, no doubt in the belief that the
two assailants were supported. They carried their panic with them into
the half-deserted camp, whence it spread among the various foraging
bands. The commotion was observed from Gibeah opposite, and, without
pausing to consult the priestly oracle, King Saul determined to attack
the camp. The attempt was completely successful, but involved no more
than the camp and its stores; the Philistines themselves effected an
unmolested retreat by the difficult road of Bethhoron.

Saul was no mere raw stripling when he ascended the throne; he already
had a grown-up son at his side. Nor was he of insignificant descent, the
family to which he belonged being a widespread one, and his heritage
considerable. His establishment at Gibeah was throughout his entire
reign the nucleus of his kingdom. The men on whom he could always reckon
were his Benjamite kinsmen. He recognised as belonging to him no other
public function besides that of war; the internal affairs of the country
he permitted to remain as they had been before his accession. War was at
once the business and the resource

<span id="page_451">p. 451</span>

of the new kingdom. It was carried on against the Philistines without
interruption, though for the most part not in the grand style but rather
in a series of border skirmishes. <span id="fr_248"></span>[1](#fn_248.md)

It is not without significance that the warlike revival of the nation
proceeded from Benjamin. By the battle of Aphek Ephraim had lost at once
the hegemony and its symbols (the camp-sanctuary at Shiloh, the ark of
the covenant). The centre of Israel gravitated southward, and Benjamin
became the connecting link between Ephraim and Judah. It would appear
that there the tyranny of the Philistines was not so much felt. Their
attacks never were made through Judah, but always came from the north;
on the other hand, people fled from them southwards, as is instanced by
the priests of Shiloh, who settled in Nob near Jerusalem. Through Saul
Judah entered definitely into the history of Israel; it belonged to his
kingdom, and it more than most others supplied him with energetic and
faithful supporters. His famous expedition against the Amalekites had
been undertaken purely in the interests of Judah, for it only could
possibly suffer from their marauding hordes.

Among the men of Judah whom the war brought to Gibeah, David ben Jesse
of Bethlehem took a conspicuous place; his skill on the harp brought him
into close relations with the king. He became Saul's armour-bearer,
afterwards the most intimate friend of his son, finally the husband of
his daughter. While he was thus winning the affections of the court, he
at the same time became the declared favourite of the people, the more
so because unexampled good fortune attended him in all he undertook.
This excited the jealousy of Saul, naturally enough in an age in which
the king always required to be the best man. Its first outburst admitted
of explanation as occasioned by an attack of illness; but soon it became
obtrusively clear that the king's love for his son-in-law had changed
into bitter hatred. Jonathan warned his friend and facilitated his
flight, the priests of Nob at the same time providing him with arms and
food. He went into the wilderness of Judah, and became the leader of a
miscellaneous band of outlaws who had been

<span id="page_452">p. 452</span>

attracted by his name to lead a roving life under his leadership. His
kinsmen from Bethlehem were of their number, but also Philistines and
Hittites. Out of this band David's bodyguard subsequently grew, the
nucleus of his army. They reckoned also a priest among them, Abiathar
ben Ahimelech ben Ahitub ben Phinehas ben Eli, the solitary survivor of
the massacre of the sons of Eli at Nob which Saul had ordered on account
of suspected conspiracy with David. Through him David was able to have
recourse to the sacred lot before the ephod. In the end he found it
impossible to hold his own in Judah against Saul's persecutions,
especially as his countrymen for the most part withheld their
assistance. He therefore took the desperate step of placing his services
at the disposal of Achish the Philistine king of Gath, by whom he was
received with open arms, the town of Ziklag being assigned him as a
residence. Here with his band he continued to follow his old manner of
life as an independent prince, subject only to an obligation to render
military service to Achish.

Meanwhile the Philistines had once more mustered their forces and
marched by the usual route against Israel. Saul did not allow them to
advance upon Gibeah, but awaited their attack in the plain of Jezreel. A
disastrous battle on Mount Gilboa ensued; after seeing his three eldest
sons fall one after another at his side, Saul threw himself upon his
sword, and was followed by his armour-bearer. The defeat seemed to have
undone the work of his life. The immediate consequence at least was that
the Philistines regained their lost ascendancy over the country to the
west of Jordan. Beyond Jordan, however, Abner, the cousin and
generalissimo of Saul, made his son Ishbaal, still a minor, king in
Mahanaim, and he was successful in again establishing the dominion of
the house over Jezreel, Ephraim, and Benjamin, of course in
uninterrupted struggle with the Philistines.

But he did not regain hold of Judah. David seized the opportunity
[to](errata.htm#4.md) set up for himself, with the sanction of the
Philistines, and, it may safely be presumed, as their vassal, a separate
principality which had its centre of gravity in the south, which was
inhabited, not by the tribe of Judah properly so called, but by the
Calebites and Jerachmeelites. This territory Abner disputed with him in
vain. In the protracted feud between the houses of Saul and David, the
fortunes of war declared themselves ever increasingly for the latter.
Personal causes at last brought matters to a crisis. Abner, by taking to
himself a concubine

<span id="page_453">p. 453</span>

of Saul's called Rizpah, had roused Ishbaal's suspicions that he was
aiming at the inheritance, and was challenged on the point. This proved
too much for his patience, and forthwith he abandoned the cause of his
ward (the hopelessness of which had already perhaps become apparent),
and entered into negotiations with David at Hebron. When about to set
out on his return he fell by the hand of Joab in the gate of Hebron, a
victim of jealousy and blood-feud. His plans nevertheless were realised.
His death left Israel leaderless and in great confusion; Ishbaal was
personally insignificant, and the people's homage continued to be
rendered to him only out of grateful fidelity to his father's memory. At
this juncture he also fell by assassins’ hands. As he was taking his
midday rest, and even the portress had gone to sleep over her task of
cleaning wheat, two Benjamite captains introduced themselves into his
palace at Mahanaim and murdered him in the vain hope of earning David's
thanks. The elders of Israel no longer hesitated about offering David
the crown, which he accepted.

His residence was immediately transferred from Hebron to Jebus, which
until then had remained in possession of the Canaanites, and first
derives historical importance from him. It lay on the border between
Israel and Judah,—still within the territory of Benjamin, but not far
from Bethlehem; near also to Nob, the old priestly city. David made it
not only the political but also the religious metropolis by transferring
thither from Kirjathjearim the ark of the covenant, which he placed
within his citadel on what afterwards became the temple hill.

Still the crown was far from being a merely honorary possession; it
involved heavy responsibilities, and doubtless what contributed more
than anything else to David's elevation to the throne was the general
recognition of the fact that he was the man best fitted on the whole to
overtake the labour it brought with it, viz., the prosecution of the war
with the Philistines, a war which was as it were the forge in which the
kingdom of Israel was welded into one. The struggle began with the
transference of the seat of royalty to Jerusalem; unfortunately we
possess only scanty details as to its progress, hardly anything more
indeed than a few anecdotes about deeds of prowess by individual heroes.
The result was in the end that David completed what Saul had begun, and
broke for ever the Philistine yoke. This was undoubtedly the greatest
achievement of his reign.

From the defensive against the Philistines David proceeded to

<span id="page_454">p. 454</span>

aggressive war, in which he subjugated the three kinsfolk of
Israel,—Moab, Ammon, and Edom. He appears to have come into conflict
first with the Moabites, whom he vanquished and treated with savage
atrocity. Not long afterwards the king of Ammon died, and David sent an
embassy of condolence to Hanun his successor. Hanun suspected in this a
sinister design,—a suspicion we can readily understand if David had
already, as is probable, subjugated Moab,—and with the utmost contumely
sent back the messengers to their master forthwith, at the same time
making preparations for war by entering into alliance with various
Syrian kings, and particularly with the powerful king of Soba. <span
id="fr_249"></span>[1](#fn_249.md) David took the initiative, and sent his
army under command of Joab against Rabbath-Ammon. The Syrians advanced
to the relief of the besieged city; but Joab divided his forces, and,
leaving his brother Abishai to hold the Ammonites in the town in check,
proceeded himself against the Syrians and repulsed them. On their
afterwards threatening to renew the attack in increased force, David
went against them in strength and defeated them at Helam "on the river."
It seems that as a result of this the kingdom of Soba was broken up and
made tributary to Damascus. Rabbath-Ammon could not now hold out any
longer, and the Ammonites shared the fate of their Moabite brethren.
Finally, Edom was about the same time coerced and depopulated; and thus
was fulfilled the vision of Balaam,—the youngest of the four Hebrew
nationalities trod the three elder under his feet.

So far as external foes were concerned, David henceforward had peace;
but new dangers arose at home within his own family. At once by
ill-judged leniency and equally ill-timed severity he had completely
alienated his son Absalom, who, after Amnon's death, was heir-apparent
to the throne. Absalom organised a revolt against his father, and to
foster it availed himself of a misunderstanding which had arisen between
David and the men of Judah, probably because they thought they were not
treated with sufficient favour. The revolt had its focus in Hebron;
Ahithophel, a man of Judah, was its soul; Amasa, also of Judah, its arm;
but the rest of Israel was also drawn into the rebellion, and only

<span id="page_455">p. 455</span>

the territory to the east of Jordan remained faithful. Thither David
betook himself with precipitancy, for the outbreak had taken him
completely by surprise. At Mahanaim, which had once before been the
centre from which the kingdom was regained, he collected his faithful
followers around him with his 600 Cherethites and Pelethites for a
nucleus, Absalom against Ahithophel's advice allowing him time for this.
In the neighbourhood of Mahanaim, in the wood of Ephraim, the decisive
blow was struck. Absalom fell, and with his death the rebellion was at
an end. It was Joseph that, in the first instance, penitently sent a
deputation to the king to bring him back. Judah, on the other hand,
continued to hold aloof. Ultimately a piece of finesse on the king's
part had the effect of bringing Judah also to its allegiance, though at
the cost of kindling such jealousy between Israel and Judah that Sheba
the Benjamite raised a new revolt, this time of Israelites, which was
soon, however, repressed by Joab.

David seems to have died soon afterwards. His historical importance is
very great. Judah and Jerusalem were wholly his creation, and, though
the united kingdom of Israel founded by him and Saul together soon fell
to pieces, the recollection of it nevertheless continued in all time to
be proudly cherished by the whole body of the people. His personal
character has been often treated with undue disparagement. For this we
must chiefly blame his canonisation by the later Jewish tradition which
made a Levitical saint of him and a pious hymn-writer. It then becomes a
strange inconsistency that he caused military prisoners to be treated
with barbarity, and the bastard sons of Saul to be hanged up before the
Lord in Gibeon. But if we take him as we find him, an antique king in a
barbarous age, our judgment of him will be much more favourable. The
most daring courage was combined in him with tender susceptibility; even
after he had ascended the throne be continued to retain the charm of a
pre-eminent and at the same time child-like personality. Even his
conduct in the affair of Uriah is not by any means wholly to his
discredit; not many kings can be mentioned who would have shown
repentance public and deep such as he manifested at Nathan's rebuke.
Least to his credit was his weakness in relation to his sons and to
Joab. On the other hand, the testament attributed to him in 1 Kings ii.
cannot be justly laid to his charge; it is the libel of a later hand
seeking to invest him with a fictitious glory. In like manner it is
unjust to hold him responsible for the deaths of Abner and

<span id="page_456">p. 456</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Amasa, or to
attribute to him any conspiracy with the hierocracy for the destruction
of Saul, and thus to deprive him of the authorship of the elegy in 2
Sam. i, which certainly was not the work of a hypocrite.

Solomon had already reached the throne, some time before his father's
death, not in virtue of hereditary right, but by palace intrigue which
had the support of the bodyguard of the Six Hundred. His glory was not
purchased on the battlefield. So far was he from showing military
capacity that he allowed a new Syrian kingdom to arise at Damascus, a
far more dangerous thing for Israel than that of Soba which had been
destroyed, and which it succeeded. During this reign Edom also regained
its independence, nothing but the port of Elath remaining in Solomon's
hands. As regards Moab and Ammon we have no information; it is not
improbable that they also revolted. But if war was not Solomon's forte,
he certainly took much greater pains than either of his predecessors in
matters of internal administration; according to tradition, the wisdom
of the ruler and the judge was his special "gift." Disregarding the
tribal system, he divided his kingdom into twelve provinces, over each
of which he placed a royal governor, thus making a beginning of vigorous
and orderly administration. <span id="fr_250"></span>[1](#fn_250.md)

Judah alone he exempted from this arrangement, as if to show special
favour. For his aim was less the advantage of his subjects than the
benefit of his exchequer, and the same object appears in his horse
traffic (1 Kings ix. 19), his Ophir trade (1 Kings x. 11), and his
cession of territory to Hiram (1 Kings ix. 11). His passions were
architecture, a gorgeous court, and the harem, in which he sought to
rival other Oriental kings, as for example his Egyptian father-in-law.
For this he required copious means-forced labour, tribute in kind, and
money. He had especially at heart the extension and improvement of
Jerusalem as a strong and splendid capital; the temple which he built
was only a portion of his vast citadel, which included within its
precincts a number of private and public buildings designed for various
uses.

It is plain that new currents were introduced into the stream of the
nation's development by such a king as this. As formerly, after the
occupation, Canaanite culture had come in, so now, after the
establishment of the kingdom, the floodgate was open for the admission
of

<span id="page_457">p. 457</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Oriental
civilisation in a deeper and wider sense. Whatever the personal motives
which led to it may have been, the results were very important, and by
no means disadvantageous on the whole. On the basis of the firmer
administration now introduced, stability and order could rest; Judah had
no cause to regret its acceptance of this yoke. Closer intercourse with
foreign lands widened the intellectual horizon of the people, and at the
same time awakened it to a deeper sense of its own peculiar
individuality. If Solomon imported Phœnician and Egyptian elements into
the worship of Jehovah at his court temple, the rigid old Israelite
indeed might naturally enough take offence (Ex. xx. 24-26), but the
temple itself nevertheless ultimately acquired a great and positive
importance for religion. It need not be denied that mischievous
consequences of various kinds slipped in along with the good. The king,
moreover, can hardly be blamed for his conduct in erecting in the
neighbourhood of Jerusalem altars to deities of Ammon and Egypt. For
those altars remained undisturbed until the time of Josiah, although
between Solomon and him there reigned more than one pious king who would
certainly have destroyed them had he found them as offensive as did the
author of Deuteronomy.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_247"></span>[448:1](phai17.htm#fr_247.md) *Neçib* is an
Aramaic word of uncertain meaning. In the name of the town Neçibin
(Nisibis) it certainly seems to mean "pillars;" according to 1 Kings iv.
5 and xxii. 48 (where it is pointed *niççab*), "governor", seems the
best translation, and this is the only rendering consistent with the
expression in 1 Sam. xiii. 3 ("Jonathan slew the *neçib*," &c.).

<span id="fn_248"></span>[451:1](phai17.htm#fr_248.md) As regards the
position of Samuel in the theocracy and the relation in which the stood
to Saul, the several narratives in the Book of Samuel differ widely. The
preceding account, so far as it relates to Samuel, is based upon 1 Sam.
ix., x. 1-15, xi., where he appears simply as a Rôeh at Ramah, and has
nothing to do either with the administration of the theocracy or with
the Nebiim. Compare *Prolegomena* above, chap. VII.

<span id="fn_249"></span>[454:1](phai17.htm#fr_249.md) Soba appears to have
been situated somewhat to the north of Damascus, and to have bordered on
the west with Hamath. The Aramæans were beginning even at that period to
press westwards; the Hittites, Phœnicians, and Israelites had common
interests against them. To the kingdom of Soba succeeded afterwards that
of Damascus.

<span id="fn_250"></span>[456:1](phai17.htm#fr_250.md) Very possibly the
Canaanites, whose complete absorption falls within this period, were an
element that helped to loosen the bonds of tribal unity, and consolidate
a state in its place.
