### CHAPTER XI.

### *THE THEOCRACY AS IDEA AND AS INSTITUTION*.

<span class="smallcaps">Writers</span> of the present day play with the
expressions "theocracy," and "theocratic" without making it clear to
themselves what these words mean and how far they are entitled to use
them. But we know that the word θεοκρατία was only coined by
Josephus; <span id="fr_234"></span>[1](#fn_234.md) and when this writer
speaks of the Mosaic constitution, he has before his eyes, it is well
known, the sacred community of his own day as it existed down to the
year 70 A.D. In ancient Israel the theocracy never existed in fact as a
form of constitution. The rule of Jehovah is here an ideal
representation; only after the exile was it attempted to realise it in
the shape of a Rule of the Holy with outward means. It is perhaps the
principal merit of Vatke's Biblical Theology to have traced through the
centuries the rise of the theocracy and the metamorphosis of the idea to
an institution.

#### I.

1\. The upholders of the prevailing view do not assert that Moses wrote
the Pentateuch, but they maintain all the more firmly that he organised
the congregation of the tabernacle in the wilderness after the fashion
described in the Priestly Code. They seem to think that Moses had no
importance further than this; as if it were an act of no moment to cast

<span id="page_412">p. 412</span>

into the field of time a seed which the action and reaction thence
arising bring an immeasurable time after to maturity (Mark iv. 26 seq.).
In fact Moses is the originator of the Mosaic constitution in about the
same way as Peter is the founder of the Roman hierarchy. Of the sacred
organisation supposed to have existed from the earliest times, there is
no trace in the time of the judges and the kings. It is thought to have
been a sort of pedagogic strait-waistcoat, to subdue the ungovernable
obstinacy of the Hebrews and to guard them from evil influences from
without. But even should it be conceded that a constitution could come
into existence in ancient times which was so utterly out of relation to
the peculiar life and temper of the people, the history of the ancient
Israelites shows us nothing so distinctly as the uncommon freshness and
naturalness of their impulses. The persons who appear always act from
the constraining impulse of their nature, the men of God not less than
the murderers and adulterers: they are such figures as could only grow
up in the open air. Judaism, which realised the Mosaic constitution and
carried it out logically, left no free scope for the individual; but in
ancient Israel the divine right did not attach to the institution but
was in the Creator Spirit, in individuals. Not only did they speak like
the prophets, they also acted like the judges and kings, from their own
free impulse, not in accordance with an outward norm, and yet, or just
because of this, in the Spirit of Jehovah. The different view of
different times is seen very characteristically in the views taken of
Saul by the two versions above sifted and compared ([p.
250](phai10.htm#page_250) seq..md).

 

2\. It is a simple and yet a very important remark of Vatke, that the
sacred constitution of the congregation, so circumstantially described
to us in the Priestly Code, is after all very defective, and presupposes
the existence of that which it was the chief task of the age of Moses to
bring about, namely the state, in the absence of which the church cannot
have any subsistence either. To maintain an elaborate and expensive
worship, and an immense swarm of clergy, must have required considerable
rates and taxes: and to raise these, as well as to uphold the authority
of the sacred persons and institutions, and most of all to enforce the
strict centralization and uniformity of the legitimate worship, all this
among a people not yet very civilised, must have required an executive
power which embraced and was able to control, the whole people. But
where

<span id="page_413">p. 413</span>

is this central authority in the period of the judges? Judicial
competence resided at that time chiefly in the smallest circles, the
families and houses. These were but little controlled, as it appears, by
the superior power of the tribe, and the very notion of the state or of
the kingdom did not as yet exist. Houses related to each other sometimes
united for common undertakings, as no doubt also did neighbouring
tribes; but this was not on the basis of any constitutional order, but
from necessity, when it happened that a well-known man came forward to
take the command and his summons to the levy was obeyed. These transient
combinations under generals were the forerunners of a permanent union
under a king: and even at the time of the Midianite war an attempt seems
to have been made in this direction, which, however, was not quite
successful. In the severe and protracted struggle with the Philistines
the necessity for a solid union of the tribes was cryingly manifest, and
the man came forward to meet the hour. Saul, a distinguished Benjamite
of Gibeah, was overcome by anger at the scornful challenge which even
the Ammonites ventured at such a time to cast in the teeth of his
people: he called his fellow-countrymen to battle, not in virtue of any
office he held, but on the strength of his own impulses; his enthusiasm
proved contagious, none dared to say him nay. He began his career just
like one of the earlier judges, but after he had led his people to
victory they did not let him retire again. The person sought for, the
king, was found.

Out of such natural beginnings did the state at that time arise: it owed
nothing to the pattern of the "Mosaic theocracy," but bears all the
marks of a new creation. Saul and David first made out of the Hebrew
tribes a real people in the political sense (Deut. xxxiii. 5). David was
in the eyes of later generations inseparable from the idea of Israel: he
was the king par excellence: Saul was thrown into the shade, but both
together are the founders of the kingdom, and have thus a much wider
importance than any of their successors. It was they who drew the life
of the people together at a centre, and gave it an aim; to them the
nation is indebted for its historical self-consciousness. All the order
of aftertimes is built up on the monarchy; it is the soil out of which
all the other institutions of Israel grow up. In the time of the judges,
we read, every man did that which was right in his own eyes, not because
the Mosaic constitution was not in force, but because there was no king
in those days. The consequences were very important in

<span id="page_414">p. 414</span>

the sphere of religion as well: since the political advance of the
people brought the historic and national character of Jehovah to the
front again. During the time of the judges the Canaanite festival cultus
had gradually been coming to be embodied in the worship of Jehovah, a
process which was certainly necessary; but in this process there was for
some time a danger that Jehovah would become a God of husbandry and of
cattle, like Baal-Dionysus. The festivals long continued to be a source
of heathenism, but now they were gradually divested of their character
as nature-festivals, and forced at length to have reference to the
nation and to its history, if they were not to disappear completely. The
relation of Jehovah to people and kingdom remained firm as a rock: even
to the worst idolaters He was the God of Israel; in war no one thought
of looking for victory and success to any other God. This was the result
of Israel's becoming a kingdom: the kingship of Jehovah, in that precise
sense which we associate with it, is the religious expression of the
fact of the foundation of the kingdom by Saul and David. The theocracy
was the state of itself; the ancient Israelites regarded the civil state
as a miracle, or, in their own words, a help of God. When the later Jews
thought or spoke of the theocracy, they took the state for granted as
already there, and so they could build the theocracy on the top of it as
a specially spiritual feature: just as we moderns sometimes see the
divine element in settled ordinances, such as marriage, not in their own
nature, but in the consecration added to them by the church.

 

3\. The kingdom of Saul and David did not long remain at its height.
Decay set in even at the separation, and when once the Assyrians were
heard at the door, it advanced with steps not to be arrested. But the
memory of the period of glory and power was all the greener, and the
hope arose of its return. From the contrast between the sorrowful
present and the brilliant past there arose the picture of the state as
it should be; when ruin was seen without and anarchy within, the
prophets set against this the pattern of the theocracy. The theocracy as
the prophets represent it to themselves is not a thing essentially
different from the political community, as a spiritual differs from a
secular power; rather, it rests on the same foundations and is in fact
the ideal of the state. Isaiah gave this ideal its classical form in
those pictures of the future which we are accustomed to call Messianic
prophecies. These passages

<span id="page_415">p. 415</span>

are not predictions of this or that occurrence, but announcements of the
aims which, it is true, the prophet only expects the future to realise,
but which are of force or ought to be of force in the present, and
towards which the community, if true to its own nature, must strive.

The first feature of these Messianic descriptions is the expulsion of
the Assyrians; but most emphasis is laid on the restoration of the inner
bases of the state, the rottenness of which has brought about and
rendered inevitable the present crisis. The collapse of the government,
the paralysis fallen on the law, the spoliation of the weak by the
strong, these are the evils that call for redress. "How is the
honourable city become a harlot; it was full of judgment, righteousness
lodged in it—but now murderers! Thy princes are rascals and companions
of thieves, every one loveth gifts and followeth after bribes; they
judge not the fatherless, neither cloth the cause of the widow come unto
them. Therefore saith the Lord: Ah, I will ease me of mine adversaries,
and avenge me of mine enemies! And I will turn my hand against thee,
Zion, and as with lye I will purge away thy dross, and I will restore
thy judges as at the first, and thy counsellors as at the beginning;
afterwards thou shalt be called a righteous and honourable city. Zion
shall be redeemed by judgment and her inhabitants by righteousness"
(Isa. i. 21-27). The state the prophet has before his eye is always the
natural state as it exists, never a community distinguished by a
peculiar holiness in its organisation. The kingdom of Jehovah is with
him entirely identical with the kingdom of David; the tasks he sets
before it are political in their nature, similar, we might say, to the
demands one would address to the Turkish Empire in our own days. He is
unconscious of any difference between human and divine law: law in
itself, jurist's law in the proper juristic sense of the word, is
divine, and has behind it the authority of the Holy One of Israel. In
that day shall Jehovah of hosts be for a crown of glory and a diadem of
beauty unto the residue of His people, and for a spirit of judgment to
him that sitteth in judgment, and a spirit of strength to them that
drive back the battle from the borders" (xxviii. 5, 6). Jehovah is a
true and perfect King, hence justice is His principal attribute and His
chief demand. And this justice is a purely forensic or social notion:
the righteousness of the Sermon on the Mount can only come into
consideration when civil justice and order have come to be a matter of
course—which at that time they had not yet done.

<span id="page_416">p. 416</span>

The representative of Jehovah is the human king. The earthly ruler is
not in the way of the heavenly: even the glorious kingdom of the future
cannot dispense with him. "Then a king shall reign in righteousness and
princes shall rule in judgment; each of them shall be as an hiding-place
from the wind and as a covert from the tempest; as rivers of waters in a
dry place, as the shadow of a great rock in a weary land" (xxxii. 1, 2).
As the reigning king is in general unsatisfactory, Isaiah hopes for a
new one who will answer the pattern of David of old, the Messiah. "There
shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse, and a branch shall grow
out of his roots: and the spirit of Jehovah shall rest upon Him, the
spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and of warlike
might, the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the Lord; and His
breath shall be drawn in the fear of Jehovah. And He shall not judge
after the sight of His eyes, nor decide by hearsay: but with
righteousness shall He judge the poor, and give sentence with equity for
the meek of the earth; but He shall smite the scorners with the rod of
His mouth, and with the breath of His lips shall He slay the wicked, so
that righteousness shall be the girdle of His loins, and faithfulness
the girdle of His reins. Then the wolf shall dwell with the lamb, and
the leopard shall lie down with the kid: and the calf and the young lion
together, and a little child shall lead them. And the cow and the bear
shall feed, their young ones shall lie down together; and the lion shall
eat straw like the ox: and the sucking child shall stroke the head of
the adder, and the weaned child shall put his hand on the eye-ball of
the basilisk. They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain"
(xi. 1-9) This is generally considered to be a prediction of a universal
golden age on earth; but Isaiah only speaks of the holy mountain as the
scene, meaning by this the whole city of David as the centre of his
kingdom. The just and strict government of the descendant of David is to
bring it about that righteousness and truth kiss each other, and that
the strong do not dare to injure the weak. Fear of the severity of the
law engenders general confidence; the lamb is no longer afraid of the
wolf. The opposite of this ideal is lawlessness and anarchy within, not
war without; the hope is not that of international peace, as we see both
from verse 1-5 and from verse 9. The Messiah is adorned just with the
virtues which befit a ruler; and this shows sufficiently what is the
nature of

<span id="page_417">p. 417</span>

the kingdom of which he is to be the head, *i.e.*, what is the notion of
the theocracy.

The other prophets of this period agree with Isaiah (Lam. iv. 20), only
Hosea is peculiar in this as in other points. He appears to have
regarded the kingdom as such as an evil; in more than one expression he
makes it the antithesis of the rule of Jehovah. But we have to remember
that this judgment of his is based entirely on his historical
experience. In the kingdom of the ten tribes the supreme power was
constantly being seized by usurpers, so that instead of being the pillar
of order and law it was the plaything of parties and the occasion of
incessant disturbances. It is this North-Israelite kingdom that Hosea
has in view; and he reprobates it for no other reason than that, in the
three hundred years of its existence, it has not approved itself, and
does not approve itself in the present time of need. He does not proceed
as on *a priori* theory, he does not apply as his rule a pattern of the
theocratic constitution given antecedently to any historical
development. There can be no doubt that it never entered his head that
the form God desired the community to take was not a thing to be
determined by circumstances, but had been revealed at Mount Sinai. <span
id="fr_235"></span>[1](#fn_235.md)

4\. Nor did the theocracy exist from the time of Moses in the form of
the covenant, though that was afterwards a favourite mode of regarding
it. The relation of Jehovah to Israel was in its nature and origin a
natural one; there was no interval between Him and His people to call
for thought or question. Only when the existence of Israel had come to
be threatened by the Syrians and Assyrians, did such prophets as Elijah
and Amos raise the Deity high above the people, sever the natural bond
between them, and put in its place a relation depending on conditions,
conditions of a moral character. To them Jehovah was the God of
righteousness in the first place, and the God of Israel in the second
place, and even that only so far as Israel came up to the righteous
demands which in His grace He had revealed to him. They inverted the
order of these two fundamental articles of faith. "If your sins are as
scarlet, how should they be reckoned white as snow? If they are red like
crimson, how should they be as wool? If ye be willing and obedient, ye
shall eat the good of the land,

<span id="page_418">p. 418</span>

but if ye refuse and rebel, ye must eat the sword, for the mouth of
Jehovah hath spoken it." Thus the nature of the conditions which Jehovah
required of His people came to the very front in considering His
relations with them: the Torah of Jehovah, which originally, like all
His dealings, fell under the category of divine aid, especially in the
doing of justice, of divine guidance in the solution of difficult
questions, was now conceived of as incorporating the demands on the
fulfilment of which His attitude towards Israel entirely depended. In
this way arose, from ideas which easily suggested it, but yet as an
entirely new thing, the substance of the notion of covenant or treaty.
The name Berith, however, does not occur in the old prophets, not even
in Hosea, who certainly presents us as clearly as possible with the
thing, in his figure of the marriage of Jehovah and Israel (Isa. i. 21).
That he was unacquainted with the technical usage of Berith is
strikingly proved by ii. 20 and vi. 7; and these passages must decide
the view we take of viii. 1, a passage which is probably interpolated.

The *name* Berith comes, it is likely, from quite a different quarter.
The ancient Hebrews had no other conception of law nor any other
designation for it than that of a treaty. A law only obtained force by
the fact of those to whom it was given binding themselves to keep it. So
it is in Exod. xxiv. 3-8, and in 2 Kings xxiii. 1-3; so also in Jeremiah
xxxiv. 8 seq.—curiously enough just as with the people of Mecca at the
time of Mohammed (Ibn Hishám, p. 230 seq.). Hence also the term Sepher
Berith for the Deuteronomic as well as the Jehovistic Book of the Law.

This use of the phrase Berith (*i.e.*, treaty) for law, fitted very well
with the great idea of the prophets, and received from it in turn an
interpretation, according to which the relation of Jehovah to Israel was
conditioned by the demands of His righteousness, as set forth in His
word and instruction. In this view of the matter Jehovah and Israel came
to be regarded as the contracting parties of the covenant by which the
various representatives of the people had originally pledged each other
to keep, say, the Deuteronomic law. <span
id="fr_236"></span>[1](#fn_236.md)

After the solemn and far-reaching act

<span id="page_419">p. 419</span>

by which Josiah introduced this law, the notion of covenant-making
between Jehovah and Israel appears to have occupied the central position
in religious thought: it prevails in Deuteronomy, in Jeremiah, Ezekiel,
in Isaiah xl.-lxvi., Lev. xvii.-xxvi., and most of all in the Book of
the Four Covenants. The Babylonian exile no doubt helped, as the
Assyrian exile had previously done, to familiarise the Jewish mind with
the idea that the covenant depended on conditions, and might possibly be
dissolved.

#### II.

1\. The tabernacle of David fell at last, and no king was born to set it
up again. The state suffered not a crisis, but destruction. And the
result was that such of the religious hopes of the people as they still
held fast, were no longer limited to existing political conditions, but
now took a freer flight, became tinged with enthusiasm, and cast off all
restrictions. In former times there was always an enemy threatening in
the background, a danger really approaching, to give rise to the
expectation of a great conflagration, the materials for which had long
been collected in the nation itself: but after the exile fancy dealt in
general coalitions of God knows what peoples against the New Jerusalem,
vaticinations for which there was no ground whatever in reality. <span
id="fr_237"></span>[1](#fn_237.md) In earlier times the national state as
it had existed under David was the goal of all wishes. Now a universal
world empire was erected in imagination, which was to lift up its head
at Jerusalem over the ruins of the heathen powers. Prophecy was no
longer tied to history, nor supported by it.

But the extravagant hopes now built on Jehovah were balanced on the
other side by sober and realisable aims which the course of history
presented. Those who waited for the consolation of Israel were then
confronted from the nature of their situation with practical tasks. The
old prophets were satisfied with expressing their ideas, with
criticising existing evils; as to practical points they had nothing to
say, the leadership of the people was in other hands. But the old
community being now gone and its heads having fallen with it, the godly
both had the power and felt the obligation to place themselves at the
head of the Israel now to be anew created, after which they had long
been striving, and

<span id="page_420">p. 420</span>

their faith in which was still unshaken. In former times the nation had
not been so seriously threatened as that its continued existence,
notwithstanding the dangerous crises it might have to pass through,
should ever cease to be regarded as natural, as a thing of course. But
now this was by no means a thing of course, the danger was a pressing
one that the Jewish exiles, like the Samaritan exiles before them, would
be absorbed by the heathens among whom they dwelt. In that case the
Messianic hopes also would have lost their point of application, for,
however true it was that the realising of them was Jehovah's concern,
the men must still be there to whom they were to be fulfilled. Thus
everything depended on getting the sacred remnant safe across this
danger, and giving it so solid an organisation that it might survive the
storms and keep alive the expectation of the promise.

But in the eyes of those whose words had weight in the restoration the
old community, as it had existed formerly, was not in good repute. They
could not but allow Jehovah's sentence of condemnation to be just which
He had spoken by the mouth of His servants and through the voice of
history. The utterances of the prophets, that fortresses and horses and
men of war, that kings and princes, cannot help, were called to mind and
turned into practical principles: the sole rule of Jehovah was to be
carried out in earnest. Circumstances favoured the design, and this was
the great point. As matters then were, the reconstitution of an actual
state was not to be thought of, the foreign rule would not admit of it
(Ezra iv. 19 seq.). What plan was to be taken, what materials to be used
for such a building as the times allowed? The prophetic ideas would not
serve as building stones; they were not sufficiently practical. Then
appeared the importance of institutions, of traditional forms, for the
conservation even of the spiritual side of the religion.

The Jewish royal temple had early overshadowed the other sanctuaries,
and in the course of the seventh century they were extinct or verging on
extinction. Under the shelter of the monarchy the priests of Jerusalem
had grown great and had at last attained, as against their professional
brethren elsewhere, a position of exclusive legitimacy. The weaker the
state grew, the deeper it sank from the fall of Josiah onwards, the
higher became the prestige of the temple in the eyes of the people, and
the greater and the more independent grew the power of its numerous
priesthood; how much more do we feel it in Jeremiah's time than in that
of Isaiah! This advance of the priesthood indicates

<span id="page_421">p. 421</span>

unmistakably the rise into prominence of the cultus in the seventh
century, a rise rather helped than hindered by the long reign of
Manasseh, evil as is the reputation of that reign. It shows itself not
only in the introduction of more luxurious materials, incense, for
example, but even more in the importance given to great and striking
services, *e.g.*, the sacrifice of children, and the expiatory offering.
Even after the abolition of the horrid atrocities of Manasseh's time,
the bloody earnestness remained behind with which the performance of
divine service was gone about.

So closely was the cultus of Jerusalem interwoven with the consciousness
of the Jewish people, and so strongly had the priesthood established
their order, that after the collapse of the kingdom the elements still
survived here for the new formation of a "congregation" answering to the
circumstances and needs of the time. Around the ruined sanctuary the
community once more lifted up its head (1 Kings viii.; Hagg. i. seq.;
Zech. i. seq.). The usages and ordinances were, though everywhere
changes in detail, yet not created afresh. Whatever creating there was
lay in this, that these usages were bound together in a system and made
the instruments of restoring an organisation of "the remnant."

Ezekiel first pointed out the way which was suited for the time. He is
the connecting link between the prophets and the law. He claims to be a
prophet, and starts from prophetic ideas: but they are not his own
ideas, they are those of his predecessors which he turns into dogmas. He
is by nature a priest, and his peculiar merit is that he enclosed the
soul of prophecy in the body of a community which was not political, but
founded on the temple and the cultus. The chapters xl.-xlviii. are the
most important in his book, and have been called by J. Orth, not
incorrectly, the key of the Old Testament.

Thus arose that artificial product, the sacred constitution of Judaism.
In the Priestly Code we have the picture of it in detail. <span
id="fr_238"></span>[1](#fn_238.md) The distinction, drawn with such pains
between the Mosaic theocracy and the post-exilic hierocracy, is too
fine. Theocracy as a constitution is hierocracy. If Moses founded such a
constitution, he did it prophetically, with a view

<span id="page_422">p. 422</span>

to circumstances which only arose a thousand years after his day, (pp.
[163](phai08.htm#page_163), [270](phai10.htm#page_270).md). Old Israel had
not shrunk to a religious congregation, public life was not quite
absorbed in the service of the sanctuary; the high priest and the
dwelling of Jehovah were not the centre round which all revolved (pp.
[170](phai09.htm#page_170), [227](phai09.htm#page_227).md). These great
changes were wrought by the destruction of the political existence first
of Samaria, then of Judah. In this way the people became "a kingdom of
priests and a holy nation," as we read in a Deuteronomistic passage,
Exod. xix. 6. If the divine rule was formerly a belief supporting the
natural ordinances of human society, it was now set forth in visible
form as a divine state, in an artificial sphere peculiar to itself and
transcending the ordinary life of the people. The idea had formerly
informed and possessed the natural body, but now, in order that it might
be thoroughly realised, it was to have spiritual body of its own. There
arose a material, external antithesis of a sacred and profane; men's
minds came to be full of this, and it was their great endeavour to draw
the line as sharply as possible and to repress the natural sphere more
and more. Holiness is the ruling idea in Ezekiel, in Lev. xvii.-xxvi.,
and in the Priestly Code. The notion is a somewhat empty one, expressing
rather what a thing is not than what it is; at first it meant the same
as divine, but now it is used mainly in the sense of spiritual,
priestly, as if the divine could be distinguished from the worldly, the
natural, by outward visible marks of that kind.

The Mosaic theocracy, the residuum of a ruined state, is itself not a
state at all, but an unpolitical artificial product created in spite of
unfavourable circumstances by the impulse of an ever-memorable energy:
and foreign rule is its necessary counterpart. In its nature it is
intimately allied to the old Catholic church, which was in fact its
child. As a matter of taste it may be objectionable to speak of the
Jewish church, but as a matter of history it is not inaccurate, and the
name is perhaps preferable to that of theocracy, which shelters such
confusion of ideas.

 

2\. The Mosaic theocracy appears to show an immense retrogression. The
law of Jehovah should denote what is characteristic of His people over
against the heathen. But this certainly did not consist in the cultus of
Israel: it would be vain labour to seek in this and that slight
variation between the Hebrew and the Greek ritual a difference of
principle between them. The cultus is the heathen element in the
Israelite religion—the word heathen not being understood, of course, in

<span id="page_423">p. 423</span>

an ignoble or unworthy sense. If the Priestly Code makes the cultus the
principal thing, that appears to amount to a systematic decline into the
heathenism which the prophets incessantly combated and yet were unable
to eradicate. It will be readily acknowledged that at the constitution
of the new Jerusalem the prophetic impulses were deflected by a
previously existing natural tendency of the mass on which they had to
operate. Yet in every part of the legal worship we see the most decided
traces of their influence. We have seen to what a large extent that
worship is everywhere marked by a centralising tendency. This tendency
is not connected in the Priestly Code with opposition to improper or
foreign worship; yet it must be interpreted as a polemical measure; and
if it be regarded as an axiom necessary in the Priestly Code from the
nature of the case, that is only saving that the demands of the prophets
had prevailed most completely in a field where they had the greatest
obstacles to contend with. Exclusive monolatry is by no means innate in
the cultus; it can only be deduced from considerations which are foreign
to the nature of the cultus: it is the antitype of strict monotheism.
The prohibition of images, too, in the worship of the Deity, is not
expressly insisted on, as in Deuteronomy, but is a provision which is
taken for granted; so little is this position in danger of question that
even doubtful and repugnant elements are embodied in the worship and
assimilated by it without hesitation. The golden ephod, denounced by
Isaiah, has become an insignificant decoration of the high-priest:
talismans, forbidden even by Ezekiel, are allowed (Num. xv. 37-41), but
the object of them is "that ye may look upon them and remember all the
commandments of Jehovah, and do them, and that ye follow not after your
own heart and your own eyes, after which ye used to go a whoring." The
gross idolatry, with which the expression ‏זנה‎ is always connected in
other passages, is by this time out of the question: the heart itself
with its lawless motions is the strange God, whose service is forbidden.

We may go further and say that by the cultus-legislation the cultus is
estranged from its own nature, and overthrown in its own sphere. That is
most unmistakably the case with regard to the festivals. They have lost
their reference to harvest and cattle, and have become historical
commemorations: they deny their birth from nature, and celebrate the
institution of supernatural religion and the gracious acts of Jehovah
therewith connected. The broadly human, the indigenous element falls

<span id="page_424">p. 424</span>

away, they receive a statutory character and a significance limited to
Israel. They no longer draw down the Deity into human life on all
important occasions, to take part in its joys and its necessities: they
are not *human attempts* with such naive means as are at command to
please the Deity and render Him favourable. They are removed from the
natural sphere, and made *divine means of grace*, which Jehovah has
instituted in Israel as sacraments of the theocracy. The worshipper no
longer thinks that in his gift he is doing God a pleasure, providing Him
with an enjoyment: what pleases Him and is effectual is only the strict
observance of the rite. The sacrifices must be offered exactly according
to prescription: at the right place, at the right time, by the right
individuals, in the right way. They are not based on the inner value of
what is done, on the impulse arising out of fresh occasions, but on the
positive command of a will outside the worshipper, which is not
explained, and which prescribes every particular. The bond between
cultus and sensuality is severed: no danger can arise of an admixture of
impure immoral elements, a danger which was always present in Hebrew
antiquity. Worship no longer springs from an inner impulse, it has come
to be an exercise of religiosity. It has no natural significance; its
significance is transcendental, incomparable, not to be defined; the
chief effect of it, which is always produced with certainty, is
atonement. For after the exile the consciousness of sin, called forth by
the rejection of the people from the face of Jehovah, was to a certain
extent permanent: even when the hard service of Israel was accomplished
and the wrath really blown over, it would not disappear.

If then the value of the sacred offerings lay not in themselves but in
obedience to the commandments of God, the centre of gravity of the
cultus was removed from that exercise itself and transferred to another
field, that of morality. The consequence was that sacrifices and gifts
gave way to *ascetic exercises*, which were more strictly and more
simply connected with morality. Precepts given originally in reference
to the consecration of the priests for their religious functions were
extended to the laity: the observance of these laws of physical
cleanliness was of much more radical importance in Judaism than the
great public cultus, and led by the straightest road towards the
theocratic ideal of holiness and of universal priesthood. The whole of
life was compressed into a certain holy path; there was always a divine
command to be fulfilled, and by thinking of it a man kept himself from
following after the desires

<span id="page_425">p. 425</span>

and lusts of his own heart. On the other hand this private cultus, which
constantly required attention, kept alive and active the individual
sense of sin.

The great pathologist of Judaism is quite right: in the Mosaic theocracy
the cultus became a pedagogic instrument of discipline. It is estranged
from the heart; its revival was due to old custom, it would never have
blossomed again of itself. It no longer has its roots in childlike
impulse, it is a dead work, in spite of all the importance attached to
it, nay, just because of the anxious conscientiousness with which it was
gone about. At the restoration of Judaism the old usages were patched
together in a new system, which, however, only served as the form to
preserve something that was nobler in its nature, but could not have
been saved otherwise than in a narrow shell that stoutly resisted all
foreign influences. That heathenism in Israel against which the prophets
vainly protested was inwardly overcome by the law on its own ground; and
the cultus, after nature had been killed in it, became the shield of
supernaturalistic monotheism.

αἱ κατὰ μέρος τῶν ἐθῶν καὶ τῶν νόμων παρὰ τοῖς ἅπασιν ἀνθρώποις
διαφοραί· οἱ μὲν γὰρ μοναρχίαις, οἱ δὲ ταῖς ὁλίγων δυναστείαις, ἄλλοι δὲ
τοῖς πλήθεσιν ἐπέτρεψαν τὴν ἐξουσίαν τῶν πολιτευμάτων?=· Ὁ δ᾽ ἡμέτερος
νομοθέτης εἰς μὲν τούτων οὐδ᾽ ὁτιοῦν ἀπεῖδεν, ὡς δ᾽ ἄν τις εἴποι
βιασάμενος τὸν λόγον θεοκρατίαν ἀπέδειξε τὸ πολίτευμα, θεῷ τὴν ἀρχὴν καὶ
τὸ κράτος ἀναθείς (*contra Apion.* ii. 17). ("There are innumerable
differences in the particular customs and laws that are among mankind;
some have intrusted the power of their states to monarchies, some to
oligarchies, and some to democracies: but our legislator had no regard
to any of these forms, *but he ordered our government to be what I may
call by a strained expression a theocracy*, attributing the power and
the authority to God." Compare also, on this whole chapter, *Die
Pharisäer und die Sadducäer*, Greifswald, 1874.

favour of David and the kingdom of Judah, but I consider all such
references in Hosea (as well as in Amos) to, be interpolations. In i. 7
there is a reference to the deliverance of Jerusalem under Hezekiah.

<span id="fn_236"></span>[418:1](phai14.htm#fr_236.md) This variation
gained entrance the more easily as Berith is used in various
applications, *e.g.*, of the capitulation, the terms of which are
imposed by the stronger on the weaker party: that the contracting
parties had equal rights was by no means involved in the notion of the
Berith. See the wavering of the notion in Jer. xxxiv. 13-18.

<span id="fn_237"></span>[419:1](phai14.htm#fr_237.md) Ezek. xxxviii.
xxxix.; Isa. lxvi. 18-24; Joel iv.; Zech. xii. xiv. In Isa. v. 26, on
the other hand, we must, of course, read ‏גוי‎, for ‏גוים‎, the singular
instead of the plur.

<span id="fn_238"></span>[421:1](phai14.htm#fr_238.md) It is not the case
that the hierocracy is based on the Priestly Code: that code was only
introduced after the hierocracy was already in existence, but helped, no
doubt, to consolidate and legalise it. The written law afterwards
undermined the rule of the priests; and the scriptures played into the
hands of the scribes and Pharisees. (Compare the case of the Parsees and
Sabians, and [p. 157](phai08.htm#page_157), note..md)
