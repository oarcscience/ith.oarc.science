### CHAPTER I.

### *THE PLACE OF WORSHIP*.

<span class="smallcaps">As</span> we learn from the New Testament, the
Jews and the Samaritans in the days of Jesus were not agreed on the
question which was the proper place of worship, but that there could be
only one was taken to be as certain as the unity of God Himself. The
Jews maintained that place to be the temple at Jerusalem, and when it
was destroyed they ceased to sacrifice. But this oneness of the
sanctuary in Israel was not originally recognised either in fact or in
law; it was a slow growth of time. With the help of the Old Testament we
are still quite able to trace the process. In doing so, it is possible
to distinguish several stages of development. We shall accordingly
proceed to inquire whether the three constituent parts of the Pentateuch
give tokens of any relationship to one or other of these; whether and
how they fall in with the course of the historical development which we
are able to follow by the aid of the historical and prophetic books from
the period of the Judges onwards.

#### I.

1\. For the earliest period of the history of Israel, all that precedes
the building of the temple, not a trace can be found of any sanctuary of
exclusive legitimacy. In the Books of Judges and Samuel hardly a place
is mentioned at which we have not at least casual mention of an altar
and of sacrifice. In great measure this multiplicity of sanctuaries was
part of the heritage taken over from the Canaanites by the Hebrews; as
they appropriated the towns and the culture generally of the previous
inhabitants, so also did they take possession of their sacred places.
The system of high places (Bamoth), with all the apparatus thereto
belonging, is certainly Canaanite originally (Deut. xii. 2, 30; Num.
xxxiii. 52; Exod. xxxiv. 12 seq.), but afterwards is of quite general
occurrence among the Hebrews. At Shechem and Gibeon the transition

<span id="page_18">p. 18</span>

takes place almost in the full light of history; some other
old-Israelite places of worship, certain of which are afterwards
represented as Levitical towns, betray their origin by their names at
least, *e.g.*, Bethshemesh or Ir Heres (Sun-town), and Ashtaroth Karnaim
(the two-horned Astarte). In the popular recollection, also, the memory
of the fact that many of the most prominent sacrificial seats were
already in existence at the date of the immigration continues to
survive. Shechem, Bethel, Beersheba, figure in Genesis as instituted by
the patriarchs; other equally important holy sites, not so. The reason
for the distinction can only lie in a consciousness of the more recent
origin of the latter; those of the one class had been found by the
people when they came, those of the other category they had themselves
established. For of course, if the Hebrews did not hesitate to
appropriate to themselves the old holy places of the country, neither
did they feel any difficulty in instituting new ones. In Gilgal and
Shiloh, in the fixed camps where, in the first instance, they had found
a permanent foothold in Palestine proper, there forthwith arose
important centres of worship; so likewise in other places of political
importance, even in such as only temporarily come into prominence, as
Ophrah, Ramah, and Nob near Gibeah. And, apart from the greater cities
with their more or less regular religious service, it is perfectly
permissible to erect an altar extempore, and offer sacrifice wherever an
occasion presents itself. When, after the battle of Michmash, the
people, tired and hungry, fell upon the cattle they had taken, and began
to devour the flesh with the blood (that is, without pouring out the
blood on the altar), Saul caused a great stone to be erected, and
ordered that every man should slaughter his ox or his sheep there. This
was the first altar which Saul erected to Jehovah, adds the narrator,
certainly not as a reproach, nor even to signalise his conduct as
anything surprising or exceptional. The instance is all the more
instructive, because it shows how the prohibition to eat flesh without
rendering the blood back to God at a time when the people did not live
crowded together within a quite limited area necessarily presupposed
liberty to sacrifice anywhere—or to slaughter anywhere; for originally
the two words are absolutely synonymous.

It need not be said that the sacrificial seats (even when the improvised
ones are left out of account) were not all alike in the regard in which
they were held, or in the frequency with which they were resorted to.
Besides purely local ones, there were others to which pilgrimages

<span id="page_19">p. 19</span>

were made from far and near. Towards the close of the period of the
judges, Shiloh appears to have acquired an importance that perhaps
extended even beyond the limits of the tribe of Joseph. By a later age
the temple there was even regarded as the prototype of the temple of
Solomon, that is, as the one legitimate place of worship to which
Jehovah had made a grant of all the burnt-offerings of the children of
Israel (Jer. vii. 12; 1 Sam. ii. 27-36). But, in point-of fact, if a
prosperous man of Ephraim or Benjamin made a pilgrimage to the joyful
festival at Shiloh at the turn of the year, the reason for his doing so
was not that he could have had no opportunity at his home in Ramah or
Gibeah for eating and drinking before the Lord. Any strict
centralisation is for that period inconceivable, alike in the religious
as in every other sphere. This is seen even in the circumstance that the
destruction of the temple of Shiloh, the priesthood of which we find
officiating at Nob a little later, did not exercise the smallest
modifying influence upon the character and position of the cultus;
Shiloh disappears quietly from the scene, and is not mentioned again
until we learn from Jeremiah that at least from the time when Solomon's
temple was founded its temple lay in ruins.

For the period during which the temple of Jerusalem was not yet in
existence, even the latest redaction of the historical books (which
perhaps does not everywhere proceed from the same hand, but all dates
from the same period—that of the Babylonian exile—and has its origin in
the same spirit) leaves untouched the multiplicity of altars and of holy
places. No king after Solomon is left uncensured for having tolerated
the high places, but Samuel is permitted in his proper person to preside
over a sacrificial feast at the Bamah of his native town, and Solomon at
the beginning of his reign to institute a similar one at the great Bamah
of Gibeon, without being blamed. The offensive name is again and again
employed in the most innocent manner in 1 Sam. ix., x., and the later
editors allow it to pass unchallenged. The principle which guides this
apparently unequal distribution of censure becomes clear from 1 Kings
iii. 2: "The people sacrificed upon the high places, for as yet no house
to the name of Jehovah had been built." Not until the house had been
built to the name of Jehovah—such is the idea—did the law come into
force which forbade having other places of worship besides. <span
id="fr_6"></span>[1](#fn_6.md)

From the building of the temple of Solomon,

<span id="page_20">p. 20</span>

which is also treated as a leading epoch in chronology, a new period in
the history of worship is accordingly dated,—and to a certain extent
with justice. The monarchy in Israel owed its origin to the need which,
under severe external pressure, had come to be felt for bringing
together into the oneness of a people and a kingdom the hitherto very
loosely connected tribes and families of the Hebrews; it had an avowedly
centralising tendency, which very naturally laid hold of the cultus as
an appropriate means for the attainment of the political end. Gideon
even, the first who came near a regal position, erected a costly
sanctuary in his city, Ophrah. David caused the ark of Jehovah to be
fetched into his fortress on Mount Sion, and attached value to the
circumstance of having for its priest the representative of the old
family which had formerly kept it at Shiloh. Solomon's temple also was
designed to increase the attractiveness of the city of his residence. It
is indubitable that in this way political centralisation gave an impulse
to a greater centralisation of worship also, and the tendency towards
the latter continued to operate after the separation of the two
kingdoms,—in Israel not quite in the same manner as in Judah. Royal
priests, great national temples, festal gatherings of the whole people,
sacrifices on an enormous scale, these were the traits by which the
cultus, previously (as it would seem) very simple, now showed the
impress of a new time. One other fact is significant: the domestic
feasts and sacrifices of single families, which in David's time must
still have been general, gradually declined and lost their importance as
social circles widened and life became more public.

But this way of regarding the influence of the monarchy upon the history
of the worship is not that of the author of the Books of Kings. He views
the temple of Solomon as a work undertaken exclusively in the interests
of pure worship, and as differing entirely in origin from the sacred
buildings of the kings of Israel, with which accordingly it is not
compared, but contrasted as the genuine is contrasted with the spurious.
It is in its nature unique, and from the outset had the design of
setting aside all other holy places,—a religious design independent of
and unconnected with politics. The view, however, is unhistorical; it
carries back

<span id="page_21">p. 21</span>

to the original date of the temple, and imports into the purpose of its
foundation the significance which it had acquired in Judah shortly
before the exile. In reality the temple was not at the outset all that
it afterwards became. Its influence was due to its own weight, and not
to a monopoly conferred by Solomon. We nowhere learn that that king,
like a forerunner of Josiah, in order to favour his new sanctuary sought
to abolish all the others; there is not the faintest historical trace of
any such sudden and violent interference with the previously existing
arrangements of worship. Never once did Solomon's successors, confined
though they were to the little territory of Judah, and therefore in a
position in which the experiment might perhaps have been practicable,
make the attempt (which certainly would have been in their interest) to
concentrate all public worship within their own temple, though in other
directions we find them exercising a very arbitrary control over affairs
of religion. The high places were not removed; this is what is regularly
told us in the case of them all. For Israel properly so called,
Jerusalem was at no time, properly speaking, the place which Jehovah had
chosen; least of all was it so after the division of the kingdom.

The Ephraimites flocked in troops through the entire length of the
southern kingdom as pilgrims to Beersheba, and, in common with the men
of Judah, to Gilgal on the frontier. Jerusalem they left unvisited. In
their own land they served Jehovah at Bethel and Dan, at Shechem and
Samaria, at Penuel and Mizpah, and at many other places. Every town had
its Bamah, in the earlier times generally on an open site at the top of
the hill on the slopes of which the houses were. Elijah, that great
zealot for purity of worship, was so far from being offended by the high
places and the multiplicity of altars to Jehovah that their destruction
brought bitterness to his soul as the height of wickedness, and with his
own hand he rebuilt the altar that had fallen into ruins on Mount
Carmel. And that the improvised offering on extraordinary occasions had
also not fallen into disuse is shown by the case of Elisha, who, when
his call came as he was following the plough, hewed his oxen to pieces
on the spot and sacrificed. In this respect matters after the building
of Solomon's temple continued to be just as they had been before.

If people and judges or kings alike, priests and prophets, men like
Samuel and Elijah, sacrificed without hesitation whenever occasion and
opportunity presented themselves, it is manifest that during the whole
of that period nobody had the faintest suspicion that such conduct

<span id="page_22">p. 22</span>

was heretical and forbidden. If a theophany made known to Joshua the
sanctity of Gilgal, gave occasion to Gideon and Manoah to rear altars at
their homes, drew the attention of David to the threshing-floor of
Araunah, Jehovah Himself was regarded as the proper founder of all these
sanctuaries,—and this not merely at the period of the Judges, but more
indubitably still at that of the narrator of these legends. He rewarded
Solomon's first sacrifice on the great Bamah at Gibeon with a gracious
revelation, and cannot, therefore, have been displeased by it. After all
this, it is absurd to speak of any want of legality in what was then the
ordinary practice; throughout the whole of the earlier period of the
history of Israel, the restriction of worship to a single selected place
was unknown to any one even as a pious desire. Men believed themselves
indeed to be nearer God at Bethel or at Jerusalem than at any
indifferent place, but of such gates of heaven there were several; and
after all, the ruling idea was that which finds its most distinct
expression in 2 Kings v. 17,—that Palestine as a whole was Jehovah's
house, His ground and territory. Not outside of Jerusalem, but outside
of Canaan had one to sojourn far from His presence, under the dominion
and (cujus regio ejus religio) in the service of strange gods. The
sanctity of the land did not depend on that of the temple; the reverse
was the case. <span id="fr_7"></span>[1](#fn_7.md)

<span id="page_23">p. 23</span>

2\. A change in this respect first begins to be prepared at that
important epoch of the religious history of Israel which is marked by
the fall of Samaria and the rise of the prophets connected therewith.
Amos and Hosea presuppose a condition of matters just such as has been
described: everywhere—in the towns, on the mountains, under green
trees—a multitude of sanctuaries and altars, at which Jehovah is served
in good faith, not with the purpose of provoking Him, but in order to
gain His favour. The language held by these men was one hitherto unheard
of when they declared that Gilgal, and Bethel, and Beersheba, Jehovah's
favourite seats, were an abomination to Him; that the gifts and
offerings with which He was honoured there kindled His wrath instead of
appeasing it; that Israel was destined to be buried under the ruins of
His temples, where protection and refuge were sought (Amos ix.). What
did they mean? It would be to misunderstand the prophets to suppose that
they took offence at the holy places—which Amos still calls Bamoth (vii.
9), and that too not in scorn, but with the deepest pathos—in and by
themselves, on account of their being more than one, or not being the
right ones. Their zeal is directed, not against the places, but against
the cultus there carried on, and, in fact not merely against its false
character as containing all manner of abuses, but almost more against
itself, against the false value attached to it. The common idea was that
just as Moab showed itself to be the people of Chemosh because it
brought to Chemosh its offerings and gifts, so Israel proved itself
Jehovah's people by dedicating its worship to Him, and was such all the
more surely as its worship was zealous and splendid; in times of danger
and need, when His help was peculiarly required, the zeal of the
worshippers was doubled and trebled. It is against this that the
prophets raise their protest while they demand quite other performances
as a living manifestation of the relation of Israel to Jehovah. This was
the reason of their so great hostility to the cultus, and the source of
their antipathy to the great sanctuaries, where superstitious zeal
outdid itself; it was this that provoked their wrath against the
multiplicity of the altars which flourished so luxuriantly on the soil
of a false confidence. That the holy places should be abolished, but the
cultus itself remain as before the main concern of religion, only
limited to a single locality was by no means their wish; but at the same
time, in point of fact, it came about as an incidental result of their
teaching that the high place in Jerusalem ultimately abolished all the
other

<span id="page_24">p. 24</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Bamoth. External
circumstances, it must be added, contributed most essentially towards
the result.

As long as the northern kingdom stood, it was there that the main
current of Israelite life manifested itself; a glance into the Books of
Kings or into that of Amos is enough to make this clear. In Jerusalem,
indeed, the days of David and of Solomon remained unforgotten; yearning
memories went back to them, and great pretensions were based upon them,
but with these the actual state of matters only faintly corresponded.
When Samaria fell, Israel shrivelled up to the narrow dimensions of
Judah, which alone survived as the people of Jehovah. Thereby the field
was left clear for Jerusalem. The royal city had always had a weighty
preponderance over the little kingdom, and within it, again, the town
had yielded in importance to the temple. From the few narratives we have
relating to Judah one almost gathers an impression as if it had no other
concern besides those of the temple; the kings in particular appear to
have regarded the charge of their palace sanctuary as the chief of all
their cares. <span id="fr_8"></span>[1](#fn_8.md) In this way the increased
importance of Judah after the fall of Samaria accrued in the first
instance to the benefit of the capital and its sanctuary, especially as
what Judah gained by the fall of her rival was not so much political
strength as an increase of religious self-consciousness. If the great
house of God upon Mount Zion had always overtopped the other shrines in
Judah, it now stood without any equal in all Israel. But it was the
prophets who led the way in determining the inferences to be drawn from
the change in the face of things. Hitherto they had principally had
their eyes upon the northern kingdom, its threatened collapse, and the
wickedness of its inhabitants, and thus had poured out their wrath more
particularly upon the places of worship there. Judah they judged more
favourably, both on personal and on substantial grounds, and they hoped
for its preservation, not concealing their sympathies for Jerusalem
(Amos i. 2). Under the impression produced by their discourses
accordingly, the fall of Samaria was interpreted as a judgment of God
against the sinful kingdom and in favour of the fallen house of David,
and the destruction of the sanctuaries of Israel was accepted as an
unmistakable declaration on Jehovah's part against His older seats on
behalf of His favourite dwelling on Zion. Finally, the fact that twenty

<span id="page_25">p. 25</span>

years afterwards Jerusalem made her triumphant escape from the danger
which had proved fatal to her haughty rival, that at the critical moment
the Assyrians under Sennacherib were suddenly constrained to withdraw
from her, raised to the highest pitch the veneration in which the temple
was held. In this connection special emphasis is usually laid—and with
justice—upon the prophetical activity of Isaiah, whose confidence in the
firm foundation of Zion continued unmoved, even when the rock began to
shake in an alarming way. Only it must not be forgotten that the
significance of Jerusalem to Isaiah did not arise from the temple of
Solomon, but from the fact that it was the city of David and the focus
of his kingdom, the central point, not of the cultus, but of the
sovereignty of Jehovah over His people. The holy mount was to him the
entire city as a political unity, with its citizens, councillors, and
judges (xi. 9); his faith in the sure foundation on which Zion rested
was nothing more than a faith in the living presence of Jehovah in the
camp of Israel. But the contemporaries of the prophet interpreted
otherwise his words and the events which had occurred. In their view
Jehovah dwelt on Zion because His house was there; it was the temple
that had been shown by history to be His true seat, and its
inviolability was accordingly the pledge of the indestructibility of the
nation. This belief was quite general in Jeremiah's time, as is seen in
the extremely vivid picture of the seventh chapter of his book; but even
as early as the time of Micah, in the first third of the seventh
century, the temple must have been reckoned a house of God of an
altogether peculiar order, so as to make it a paradox to put it on a
level with the Bamoth of Judah, and a thing unheard of to believe in its
destruction.

At the same time, notwithstanding the high and universal reverence in
which the temple was held, the other sanctuaries still continued, in the
first instance, to subsist alongside of it. King Hezekiah indeed is said
to have even then made an attempt to abolish them, but the attempt,
having passed away without leaving any trace, is of a doubtful nature.
It is certain that the prophet Isaiah did not labour for the removal of
the Bamoth. In one of his latest discourses his anticipation for that
time of righteousness and the fear of God which is to dawn after the
Assyrian crisis is: "Then shall ye defile the silver covering of your
graven images and the golden plating of your molten images—ye shall cast
them away as a thing polluted; Begone! shall ye say unto them" (xxx.
22). If he thus hopes for a purification from superstitious accretions
of the places where

<span id="page_26">p. 26</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Jehovah is
worshipped, it is clear that he is not thinking of their total
abolition. Not until about a century after the destruction of Samaria
did men venture to draw the practical conclusion from the belief in the
unique character of the temple at Jerusalem. That this was not done from
a mere desire to be logical, but with a view to further reforms, need
not be said. With the tone of repudiation in which the earlier prophets,
in the zeal of their opposition, had occasionally spoken of practices of
worship at large, there was nothing to be achieved; the thing to be
aimed at was not abolition, but reformation, and the end it was believed
would be helped by concentration of all ritual in the capital. Prophets
and priests appear to have made common cause in the prosecution of the
work. It was the high priest Hilkiah who in the first instance called
attention to the discovered book which was to be made the basis of
action; the prophetess Huldah confirmed its divine contents; the priests
and prophets were a prominent element in the assembly at which the new
law was promulgated and sworn to. Now an intimate fellowship between
these two leading classes appears to be characteristic of the whole
course of the religious movement in Judah, and to have been necessarily
connected with the lines on which that movement advanced; <span
id="fr_9"></span>[1](#fn_9.md) we shall be justified therefore in assuming
that the display of harmony between them on this occasion was not got up
merely for the purposes of scenic effect, but that the change in the
national cultus now proposed was really the common suggestion of
prophets and priests. In point of fact, such a change was equally in
accordance with the interests of the temple and with those of the
prophetic party of reform. To the last named the restriction of the
sacrificial worship must have in itself seemed an advantage; to it in
later times the complete abolition of sacrifice was mainly due, and
something of the later effect doubtless lay in the original intention.
Then, too, the Jehovah of Hebron was only too easily regarded as
distinct from the Jehovah of Bethshemesh or of Bethel, and so a strictly
monarchical conception of God naturally led to

<span id="page_27">p. 27</span>

the conclusion that the place of His dwelling and of His worship could
also only be one. All writers of the Chaldæan period associate
monotheism in the closest way with unity of worship (Jer. ii. 28, xi.
13). And the choice of the locality could present no difficulty; the
central point of the kingdom had of necessity also to become the central
point of the worship. Even Jerusalem and the house of Jehovah there
might need some cleansing, but it was clearly entitled to a preference
over the obscure local altars. It was the seat of all higher culture,
lying under the prophets’ eyes, much more readily accessible to light
and air, reform and control. It is also possible, moreover, that the
Canaanite origin of most of the Bamoth, which is not unknown, for
example, to Deuteronomy, may have helped to discredit them, while, on
the other hand, the founding of Jerusalem belonged to the proudest
memories of Israelite history, and the Ark, which had been the origin of
the temple there, had a certain right to be considered the one genuine
Mosaic sanctuary. <span id="fr_10"></span>[1](#fn_10.md)

In the eighteenth year of Josiah, 601 B.C., the first heavy blow fell
upon the local sacrificial places. How vigorously the king set to work,
how new were the measures taken, and how deeply they cut, can be learned
from the narrative of 2 Kings xxiii. Yet what a vitality did the green
trees upon the high mountains still continue to show! Even now they were
but polled, not uprooted. After Josiah's death we again see Bamoth
appearing on all hands, not merely in the country, but even in the
capital itself. Jeremiah has to lament that there are as many altars as
towns in Judah. All that had been attained by the reforming party was
that they could now appeal to a written law that had been solemnly sworn
to by the whole people, standing ever an immovable witness to the rights
of God. But to bring it again into force and to carry it out was no easy
matter, and would certainly have been impossible to the unaided efforts
of the prophets—a Jeremiah or an Ezekiel.

3 Had the people of Judah remained in peaceful possession of their land,
the reformation of Josiah would hardly have penetrated to the

<span id="page_28">p. 28</span>

masses; the threads uniting the present with the past were too strong.
To induce the people to regard as idolatrous and heretical centres of
iniquity the Bamoth, with which from ancestral times the holiest
memories were associated, and some of which, like Hebron and Beersheba,
had been set up by Abraham and Isaac in person, required a complete
breaking-off of the natural tradition of life, a total severance of all
connection with inherited conditions. This was accomplished by means of
the Babylonian exile, which violently tore the nation away from its
native soil, and kept it apart for half a century,—a breach of
historical continuity than which it is almost impossible to conceive a
greater. The new generation had no natural, but only an artificial
relation to the times of old; the firmly rooted growths of the old soil,
regarded as thorns by the pious, were extirpated, and the freshly
ploughed fallows ready for a new sowing. It is, of course, far from
being the case that the whole people at that time underwent a general
conversion in the sense of the prophets. Perhaps the majority totally
gave up the past, but just on that account became lost among the
heathen, and never subsequently came into notice. Only the pious ones,
who with trembling followed Jehovah's word, were left as a remnant; they
alone had the strength to maintain the Jewish individuality amid the
medley of nationalities into which they had been thrown. From the exile
there returned, not the nation, but a religious sect,—those, namely, who
had given themselves up body and soul to the reformation ideas. It is no
wonder that to these people, who, besides, on their return, all settled
in the immediate neighbourhood of Jerusalem, the thought never once
occurred of restoring the local cults. It cost them no struggle to allow
the destroyed Bamoth to continue lying in ruins; the principle had
become part of their very being, that the one God had also but one place
of worship, and thenceforward for all time coming this was regarded as a
thing of course.

#### II.

Such was the actual historical course of the centralisation of the
cultus, and such the three stadia which can be distinguished. The
question now presents itself, whether it is possible to detect a
correspondence between the phases of the actual course of events and
those of the legislation relating to this subject. All three portions of
the

<span id="page_29">p. 29</span>

legislation contain ordinances on the subject of sacrificial places and
offerings. It may be taken for granted that in some way or other these
have their roots in history, and do not merely hang in the air, quite
away from or above the solid ground of actuality.

1\. The main Jehovistic law, the so-called Book of the Covenant,
contains (Exod. xx. 24-26) the following ordinance: "An altar of earth
shalt thou make unto me, and thereon shalt thou sacrifice thy burnt
offerings and thy peace-offerings, thy sheep and thine oxen; in place
where I cause my name to be honoured will I come unto and will bless
thee. Or if thou wilt make me an altar of stones, thou shalt not build
it of hewn stones, for if thou hast lifted up thy tool upon it thou hast
polluted it. And thou shalt not go up to mine altar by steps, that thy
nakedness be not discovered before it." Unquestionably it is not the
altar of the tabernacle, which was made of wood and plated over with
brass, nor that of Solomon's temple, which on its eastern side had a
flight of steps, <span id="fr_11"></span>[1](#fn_11.md) and had a passage
right round it at half its height, that is here described as the only
true one. On the other hand, it is obvious that a multiplicity of altars
is not merely regarded as permissible, but assumed as a matter of
course. For no stress at all is laid upon having always the same
sacrificial seat, whether fixed or to be moved about from place to
place; earth and unhewn stones <span id="fr_12"></span>[2](#fn_12.md) of
the field can be found everywhere, and such an altar falls to pieces
just as readily as it is built. A choice of two kinds of material is
also given, which surely implies that the lawgiver thought of more than
one altar; and not at *the* place, but at *every* place where He causes
His name to

<span id="page_30">p. 30</span>

be honoured will Jehovah come to His worshippers and bless them. Thus
the law now under consideration is in harmony with the custom and usage
of the first historical period, has its root therein, and gives sanction
to it. Certainly the liberty to sacrifice everywhere seems to be
somewhat restricted by the added clause, "in every place where I cause
my name to be honoured." But this means nothing more than that the spots
where intercourse between earth and heaven took place were not willingly
regarded as arbitrarily chosen, but, on the contrary, were considered as
having been somehow or other selected by the Deity Himself for His
service.

In perfect correspondence with the Jehovistic law is the Jehovistic
narrative of the Pentateuch, as, in particular, the story of the
patriarchs in J and E very clearly shows. At every place where they take
up their abode or make a passing stay, the fathers of the nation,
according to this authority, erect altars, set up memorial stones, plant
trees, dig wells. This does not take place at indifferent and casual
localities, but at Shechem and Bethel in Ephraim, at Hebron and
Beersheba in Judah, at Mizpah, Mahanaim, and Penuel in Gilead; nowhere
but at famous and immemorially holy places of worship. It is on this
that the interest of such notifications depends; they are no mere
antiquarian facts, but full of the most living significance for the
present of the narrator. The altar built by Abraham at Shechem is the
altar on which sacrifice still continues to be made, and bears "even
unto this day" the name which the patriarch gave it. On the spot where
at Hebron he first entertained Jehovah, there down to the present day
the table has continued to be spread; even as Isaac himself did, so do
his sons still swear (Amos viii. 14; Hos. iv. 15) by the sacred well of
Beersheba, which he digged, and sacrifice there upon the altar which he
built, under the tamarisk which he planted. The stone which Jacob
consecrated at Bethel the generation of the living continues to anoint,
paying the tithes which of old he vowed to the house of God there. This
also is the reason why the sacred localities are so well known to the
narrator, and are punctually and accurately recorded notwithstanding the
four hundred years of the Egyptian sojourn, which otherwise would have
made their identification a matter of some little difficulty. The altar
which Abraham built at Bethel stands upon the hill to the east of the
town, between Bethel on the west and Ai on the east; others are
determined by means of a tree or a well, as that of

<span id="page_31">p. 31</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Shechem or
Beersheba. <span id="fr_13"></span>[1](#fn_13.md) But of course it was not
intended to throw dishonour upon the cultus of the present when its
institution was ascribed to the fathers of the nation. Rather, on the
contrary, do these legends glorify the origin of the sanctuaries to
which they are attached, and surround them with the nimbus of a
venerable consecration. All the more as the altars, as a rule, are not
built by the patriarchs according to their own private judgment
wheresoever they please; on the contrary, a theophany calls attention
to, or at least afterwards confirms, the holiness of the place. Jehovah
appears at Shechem to Abraham, who thereupon builds the altar "to
Jehovah who had appeared unto him;" he partakes of his hospitality under
the oak of Mamre, which is the origin of the sacrificial service there;
He shows him the place where he is to make an offering of his son, and
here the sanctuary continues to exist. On the first night of Isaac's
sleeping on the sacred soil of Beersheba (xxvi. 24) he receives a visit
from the *Numen* there residing, and in consequence rears his altar.
Surprised by profane glances, Jehovah acts as a destroyer, but Himself
spontaneously points out to His favoured ones the places where it is His
pleasure to allow Himself to be seen; and where men have seen Him and
yet lived, there a sanctuary marks the open way of access to Him. The
substance of the revelation is in these cases comparatively indifferent:
"I am God." What is of importance is the theophany in and for itself,
its occurrence on that particular place. It must not be regarded as an
isolated fact, but rather as the striking commencement of an intercourse
(‏ראה פני יהוה‎) between God and man which is destined to be continued
at this spot, and also as the first and strongest expression of the
sanctity of the soil. This way of looking at the thing appears most
clearly and with incomparable charm in the story of the ladder which
Jacob saw at Bethel. "He dreamed, and behold a ladder set up on the
earth, and the top of it reached to heaven, and behold the angels of God
ascending and descending on it. And he was afraid and said, How dreadful
is this place! This is none

<span id="page_32">p. 32</span>

other but the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven." The ladder
stands at the place not at this moment merely, but continually, and, as
it were, by nature. Bethel—so Jacob perceives from this—is a place where
heaven and earth meet, where the angels ascend and descend, to carry on
the communication between earth and heaven ordained by God at this gate.

All this is only to be understood as a glorification of the relations
and arrangements of the cultus as we find them (say) in the first
centuries of the divided kingdom. All that seems offensive and
heathenish to a later age is here consecrated and countenanced by
Jehovah Himself and His favoured ones,—the high places, the memorial
stones (maççeboth), the trees, the wells. <span
id="fr_14"></span>[1](#fn_14.md) An essential agreement prevails between
the Jehovistic law which sanctions the existing seats of worship and the
Jehovistic narrative; the latter is as regards its nucleus perhaps
somewhat older. Both obviously belong to the pre-prophetic period; a
later revision of the narrative in the prophetic sense has not altered
the essential character of its fundamental elements. It is inconceivable
that Amos or Hosea, or any like-minded person, could go with such
sympathising love and believing reverence into narratives which only
served to invest with a still brighter nimbus and higher respect the
existing religious worship, carried on by the people on the high places
of Isaac as their holiest occupation.

2\. The Jehovistic Book of the Covenant lies indeed at the foundation of
Deuteronomy, but in one point they differ materially, and that precisely
the one which concerns us here. As there, so here also, the legislation
properly so called begins (Deut. xii.) with an ordinance relating to the
service of the altar; but now we have Moses addressing the Israelites in
the following terms: "When ye come into the land of Canaan, ye shall
utterly destroy all the places of worship which ye find there, and ye
shall not worship Jehovah your God after the manner in which the heathen
serve theirs. Nay, but only unto the place which the Lord your God shall
choose out of all your tribes for His habitation shall ye seek, and
thither shall ye bring your offerings and gifts, and there shall ye eat
before Him and rejoice. Here at this day we do every

<span id="page_33">p. 33</span>

man whatsoever is right in his own eyes, but when ye have found fixed
abodes, and rest from your enemies round about, then shall the place
which Jehovah shall choose for His habitation in one of your tribes be
the one place to which ye shall bring your offerings and gifts. Take
heed that ye offer not in every place that ye see; ye may not eat your
holy gifts in every town, but only in the place which Jehovah shall
choose."

The Law is never weary of again and again repeating its injunction of
local unity of worship. In doing so, it is in conscious opposition to
"the things that we do here this day," and throughout has a polemical
and reforming attitude towards existing usage. It is rightly therefore
assigned by historical criticism to the period of the attacks made on
the Bamoth by the reforming party at Jerusalem. As the Book of the
Covenant, and the whole Jehovistic writing in general, reflects the
first pre-prophetic period in the history of the cultus, so Deuteronomy
is the legal expression of the second period of struggle and transition.
The historical order is all the more certain because the literary
dependence of Deuteronomy on the Jehovistic laws and narratives can be
demonstrated independently, and is an admitted fact. From this the step
is easy to the belief that the work whose discovery gave occasion to
King Josiah to destroy the local sanctuaries was this very Book of
Deuteronomy, which originally must have had an independent existence,
and a shorter form than at present. This alone, at least, of all the
books of the Pentateuch, gives so imperious an expression to the
restriction of the sacrificial worship to the one chosen place; here
only does the demand make itself so felt in its aggressive novelty and
dominate the whole tendency of the law-maker. The old material which he
makes use of is invariably shaped with a view to this, and on all hands
he follows the rule out to its logical consequences. To make its
fulfilment possible, he changes former arrangements, permitting what had
been forbidden, and prohibiting what had been allowed; in almost every
case this motive lies at the foundation of all his other innovations.
This is seen, for example, when he permits slaying without sacrificing,
and that too anywhere; when, in order not to abolish the right of asylum
(Exod. xxi. 13, 14; 1 Kings ii. 28) along with the altars, he appoints
special cities of refuge for the innocent who are pursued by the avenger
of blood; when he provides for the priests of the suppressed
sanctuaries, recommending the provincials to take them along with them
on their sacrificial

<span id="page_34">p. 34</span>

pilgrimages, and giving them the right to officiate in the temple at
Jerusalem just like the hereditarily permanent clergy there. In other
respects also the dominance of the same point of view is seen: for
example, it is chiefly from regard to it that the old ordinances and
customs relating to the religious dues and the festivals are set forth
in the form which they must henceforth assume. A law so living, which
stands at every point in immediate contact with reality, which is at war
with traditionary custom, and which proceeds with constant reference to
the demands of practical life, is no mere velleity, no mere cobweb of an
idle brain, but has as certainly arisen out of historical occasions as
it is designed to operate powerfully on the course of the subsequent
history. A judgment pronounced in accordance with the facts can
therefore assign to it an historical place only within that movement of
reformation which was brought to a victorious issue by King Josiah.

3\. It is often supposed that the Priestly Code is somewhat indifferent
to the question of the one sanctuary, neither permitting multiplicity of
sacrificial centres nor laying stress upon the unity, and that on
account of this attitude it must be assigned to an earlier date than
Deuteronomy. <span id="fr_15"></span>[1](#fn_15.md) Such an idea is, to say
the least, in the highest degree superficial. The assumption that
worship is restricted to one single centre runs everywhere throughout
the entire document. To appeal specially, in proof of the restriction,
to Lev. xvii. or Josh. xxii., is to indicate a complete failure to
apprehend the whole tenor of Exod. xxv.-Lev. ix. Before so much as a
single regulation having reference to the matter of worship can be given
(such is the meaning of the large section referred to), the one rightful
place wherein to engage in it must be specified. The tabernacle is not
narrative merely, but, like all the narratives in that book, law as
well; it expresses the legal unity of the worship as an historical fact,
which, from the very beginning, ever since the exodus, has held good in
Israel. One God one sanctuary, that is the idea. With the ordinances of
the tabernacle, which form the sum of the divine revelation on Sinai,
the theocracy was founded; where the one is, there is the other. The
description of it, therefore,

<span id="page_35">p. 35</span>

stands at the head of the Priestly Code, just as that of the temple
stands at the head of the legislation in Ezekiel. It is the basis and
indispensable foundation, without which all else would merely float in
the air: first must the seat of the Divine Presence on earth be given
before the sacred community can come into life and the cultus into
force. Is it supposes that the tabernacle tolerates other sanctuaries
besides itself? Why then the encampment of the twelve tribes around it,
which has no military, but a purely religious significance, and derives
its whole meaning from its sacred centre? Whence this concentration of
all Israel into one great congregation (‏קהל‎, ‏עדה‎), without its like
anywhere else in the Old Testament? On the contrary, there is no other
place besides this at which God dwells and suffers Himself to be seen;
no place but this alone where man can draw near to Him and seek His face
with offerings and gifts. This view is the axiom that underlies the
whole ritual legislation of the middle part of the Pentateuch. It is
indicated with special clearness by the ‏לפני אהל מועד‎ (before the
tabernacle), introduced at every turn in the ordinances for sacrifice.

What then are we to infer from this as to the historical place of the
Priestly Code, if it be judged necessary to assign it such a place at
all? By all the laws of logic it can no more belong to the first period
than Deuteronomy does. But is it older or younger than Deuteronomy? In
that book the unity of the cultus is *commanded;* in the Priestly Code
it is *presupposed*. Everywhere it is tacitly assumed as a fundamental
postulate, but nowhere does it find actual expression; <span
id="fr_16"></span>[1](#fn_16.md) it is nothing new, but quite a thing of
course. What follows from this for the question before us? To my
thinking, this:—that the Priestly Code rests upon the result which is
only the aim of Deuteronomy. The latter is in the midst of movement and
conflict: it clearly speaks out its reforming intention, its opposition
to the traditional "what we do here this day;" the former stands outside
of and above the struggle,—the end has been reached and made a secure
possession. On the basis of the Priestly Code no reformation would ever
have taken place, no Josiah would ever have observed from it that the
actual condition of affairs was perverse and required to be set right;
it proceeds as if everything had been for long in the best of

<span id="page_36">p. 36</span>

order. It is only in Deuteronomy, moreover, that one sees to the root of
the matter, and recognises its connection with the anxiety for a strict
monotheism and for the elimination from the worship of the popular
heathenish elements, and thus with a deep and really worthy aim; in the
Priestly Code the reason of the appointments, in themselves by no means
rational, rests upon their own legitimacy, just as everything that is
actual ordinarily seems natural and in no need of explanation. Nowhere
does it become apparent that the abolition of the Bamoth and Asherim and
memorial stones is the real object contemplated; these institutions are
now almost unknown, and what is really only intelligible as a negative
and polemical ordinance is regarded as full of meaning in itself.

The idea as idea is older than the idea as history. In Deuteronomy it
appears in its native colours, comes forward with its aggressive
challenge to do battle with the actual. One step indeed is taken towards
investing it with an historical character, in so far as it is put into
the mouth of Moses; but the beginning thus made keeps within modest
limits. Moses only lays down the law; for its execution he makes no
provision as regards his own time, nor does he demand it for the
immediate future. Rather it is represented as not destined to come into
force until the people shall have concluded the conquest of the country
and secured a settled peace. We have already found reason to surmise
that the reference to "menuha" is intended to defer the date when the
Law shall come into force to the days of David and Solomon (1 Kings
viii. 16). This is all the more probable inasmuch as there is required
for its fulfilment "the place which Jehovah shall choose," by which only
the capital of Judah can be meant. Deuteronomy, therefore, knows nothing
of the principle that what ought to be must actually have been from the
beginning. Until the building of Solomon's temple the unity of worship
according to it had, properly speaking, never had any existence; and,
moreover, it is easy to read between the lines that even after that date
it was more a pious wish than a practical demand. The Priestly Code, on
the other hand, is unable to think of religion without the one
sanctuary, and cannot for a moment imagine Israel without it, carrying
its actual existence back to the very beginning of the theocracy, and,
in accordance with this, completely altering the ancient history. The
temple, the focus to which the worship was concentrated, and which in
reality was not built until Solomon's time, is by this document regarded
as so

<span id="page_37">p. 37</span>

indispensable, even for the troubled days of the wanderings before the
settlement, that it is made portable, and in the form of a tabernacle
set up in the very beginning of things. For the truth is, that the
tabernacle is the copy, not the prototype, of the temple at Jerusalem.
The resemblance of the two is indeed unmistakable, <span
id="fr_17"></span>[1](#fn_17.md) but it is not said in 1 Kings vi. that
Solomon made use of the old pattern and ordered his Tyrian workmen to
follow it. The posteriority of the Mosaic structure comes into clearer
light from the two following considerations brought forward by Graf (p.
60 seq.). In the first place, in the description of the tabernacle
mention is repeatedly made of its south, north, and west side, without
any preceding rubric as to a definite and constantly uniform
orientation; the latter is tacitly taken for granted, being borrowed
from that of the temple, which was a fixed building, and did not change
its site. In the second place, the brazen altar is, strictly speaking,
described as an altar of wood merely plated with brass,—for a fireplace
of very large size, upon which a strong fire continually burns, a
perfectly absurd construction, which is only to be accounted for by the
wish to make the brazen altar which Solomon cast (1 Kings xvi. 14)
transportable, by changing its interior into wood. The main point,
however, is this, that the tabernacle of the Priestly Code in its
essential meaning is not a mere provisional shelter for the ark on the
march, but the sole legitimate sanctuary for the community of the twelve
tribes prior to the days of Solomon, and so in fact a projection of the
later temple. How modest, one might almost say how awkwardly bashful, is
the Deuteronomic reference to the future place which Jehovah is to
choose when compared with this calm matter-of-fact assumption that the
necessary centre of unity of worship was given from the first! In the
one case we have, so to speak, only the idea as it exists in the mind of
the lawgiver, but making no claim to be realised till a much later date;
in the other, the Mosaic idea has acquired also a Mosaic embodiment,
with which it entered the world at the very first.

By the same simple historical method which carries the central sanctuary
back into the period before Solomon does the Priestly author abolish the
other places of worship. His forty-eight Levitical cities are for the
most part demonstrably a metamorphosis of the old

<span id="page_38">p. 38</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Bamoth to meet the
exigencies of the time. The altar which the tribes eastward of Jordan
build (Josh. xxii.) is erected with no intention that it should be used,
but merely in commemoration of something. Even the pre-Mosaic period is
rendered orthodox in the same fashion. The patriarchs, having no
tabernacle, have no worship at all; according to the Priestly Code they
build no altars, bring no offerings, and scrupulously abstain from
everything by which they might in any way encroach on the privilege of
the one true sanctuary. This manner of shaping the patriarchal history
is only the extreme consequence of the effort to carry out with
uniformity in history the *semper ubique et ab omnibus* of the legal
unity of worship.

Thus in Deuteronomy the institution is only in its birth-throes, and has
still to struggle for the victory against the praxis of the present, but
in the Priestly Code claims immemorial legitimacy and strives to bring
the past into conformity with itself, obviously because it already
dominates the present; the carrying back of the new into the olden time
always takes place at a later date than the ushering into existence of
the new itself. Deuteronomy has its position in the very midst of the
historical crisis, and still stands in a close relation with the older
period of worship, the conditions of which it can contest, but is unable
to ignore, and still less to deny. But, on the other hand, the Priestly
Code is hindered by no survival to present times of the older usage from
projecting an image of antiquity such as it must have been; unhampered
by visible relics or living tradition of an older state, it can idealise
the past to its heart's content. Its place, then, is after Deuteronomy,
and in the third post-exilian period of the history of the cultus, in
which, on the one hand, the unity of the sanctuary was an established
fact, contested by no one and impugned by nothing, and in which, on the
other hand, the natural connection between the present and the past had
been so severed by the exile that there was no obstacle to prevent an
artificial and ideal repristination of the latter.

#### III.

The reverse of this is what is usually held. In Deuteronomy, it is
considered, there occur clear references to the period of the kings; but
the Priestly Code, with its historical presuppositions, does not fit in
with any situation belonging to that time, and is therefore older. When
the

<span id="page_39">p. 39</span>

cultus rests upon the temple of Solomon as its foundation, as in
Ezekiel, then every one recognises the later date; but when it is based
upon the tabernacle, the case is regarded as quite different. The great
antiquity of the priestly legislation is proved by relegating it to an
historical sphere, created by itself out of its own legal premisses, but
which is nowhere to be found within, and therefore must have preceded
actual history. Thus (so to speak) it holds itself up in the air by its
own waistband.

1\. It may, however, seem as if hitherto it had only been *asserted*
that the tabernacle rests on an historical fiction. In truth it is
proved; but yet it may be well to add some things which have indeed been
said long before now, but never as yet properly laid to heart. The
subject of discussion, be it premised, is the tabernacle of the Priestly
Code; for some kind of tent for the ark there may well have been: in
fact, tents were in Palestine the earliest dwellings of idols (Hos. ix.
6), and only afterwards gave place to fixed houses; and even the
Jehovistic tradition (although not J) knows of a sacred tent <span
id="fr_18"></span>[1](#fn_18.md) in connection with the Mosaic camp, and
outside it, just as the older high places generally had open sites
without the city. The question before us has reference exclusively to
the particular tent which, according to Exodus xxv. seq., was erected at
the command of God as the basis of the theocracy, the pre-Solomonic
central sanctuary, which also in outward details was the prototype of
the temple. At the outset its very possibility is doubtful. Very strange
is the contrast between this splendid structure, on which the costliest
material is lavished and wrought in the most advanced style of Oriental
art, and the soil on which it rises, in the wilderness amongst the
native Hebrew nomad tribes, who are represented as having got it ready
offhand, and without external help. The incompatibility has long been
noticed, and gave rise to doubts as early as the time of Voltaire. These
may, however, be left to themselves; suffice it that Hebrew tradition,
even from the time of the judges and the first kings, for which the
Mosaic tabernacle was strictly speaking intended, knows nothing at all
about it.

It appears a bold thing to say so when one sees how much many a modern
author who knows how to make a skilful use of the Book of

<span id="page_40">p. 40</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Chronicles has to
tell about the tabernacle. For in 2 Chron. i. 3 seq. we are told that
Solomon celebrated his accession to the throne with a great sacrificial
feast at Gibeon, because the tabernacle and the brazen altar of Moses
were there. In like manner in 1 Chron. xxi. 29 it is said that David
offered sacrifice indeed on the threshing-floor of Araunah, but that
Jehovah's dwelling-place and the legitimate altar were at that time at
Gibeon; and further (xvi. 39), that Zadok, the legitimate high priest,
officiated there. From these data the Rabbins first, and in recent times
Keil and Movers especially, have constructed a systematic history of the
tabernacle down to the building of the temple. Under David and Solomon,
as long as the ark was on Mount Zion, the tabernacle was at Gibeon, as
is also shown by the fact that (2 Sam. xxi. 6, 9) offerings were
sacrificed to Jehovah there. Before that it was at Nob, where ephod and
shewbread (1 Sam. xxi.) are mentioned, and still earlier, from Joshua's
time onward, it was at Shiloh. But these were only its permanent sites,
apart from which it was temporarily set up now here, now there, saving
by its rapidity of movement—one might almost say ubiquity—the unity of
the cultus, notwithstanding the variety and great distances of the
places at which that cultus was celebrated. In every case in which a
manifestation of Jehovah and an offering to Him are spoken of, the
tabernacle must be tacitly understood. <span
id="fr_19"></span>[1](#fn_19.md)

The dogmatic character of this way of making history, and the absurd
consequences to which it leads, need not in the meantime be insisted on;
what is of greatest importance is that the point from which it starts is
in the last degree insecure; for the statement of Chronicles that
Solomon offered the offering of his accession upon the altar of the
tabernacle at Gibeon is in contradiction with that of the older parallel
narrative of 1 Kings iii. 1-4. The latter not only is silent about the
Mosaic tabernacle, which is alleged to have stood at Gibeon, but
expressly says that Solomon offered upon a high place (as such), and
*excuses him for this* on the plea that at that time no house to the
name of Jehovah had as yet been built. That the Chronicler draws from
this narrative is certain on general grounds, and is shown particularly
by this, that he designates the tabernacle at Gibeon by the name of
Bamah—*a contradictio in adjecto* 

<span id="page_41">p. 41</span>

which is only to be explained by the desire to give an authentic
interpretation of "the great Bamah at Gibeon" in 1 Kings iii. Here, as
elsewhere, he brings the history into agreement with the Law: the young
and pious Solomon can have offered his sacrifice only at the legal place
which therefore must be that high place at Gibeon. Along with 2 Chron.
i. 3 seq. also fall the two other statements (1 Chron. xvi. 39, xxi.
29), both of which are dependent on that leading passage, as is clear
revealed by the recurring phrase "the Bamah of Gibeon." The tabernacle
does not elsewhere occur in Chronicles; it has not yet brought its
consequences with it, and not yet permeated the historical view of the
author. He would certainly have experienced some embarrassment at the
question whether it had previously stood at Nob, for he lays stress upon
the connection between the legitimate sanctuary and the legitimate
Zadok-Eleazar priestly family, which it is indeed possible to assume for
Shiloh, but not for Nob. <span id="fr_20"></span>[1](#fn_20.md)

The fact that Chronicles represents the Israelite history in accordance
with the Priestly Code has had the effect of causing its view of the
history to be involuntarily taken as fundamental, but ought much rather
to have caused it to be left altogether out of account where the object
to ascertain what was the real and genuine tradition. The Books of
Judges and Samuel make mention indeed of many sanctuaries, but never
among them of the tabernacle, the most important of all. For the single
passage where the name Ohel Moed occurs (1 Sam. ii. 22 is badly
attested, and from its contents open to suspicion. <span
id="fr_21"></span>[2](#fn_21.md) Of the existence of the ark of Jehovah
there certainly are distinct traces towards the end of the period of the
judges (compare 1 Samuel iv.-vi.) But is the ark a guarantee of the
existence of the tabernacle? On the contrary its whole history down to
the period of its being deposited in the temple of Solomon is a proof
that it was regarded as quite independent of any tent specially
consecrated for its reception. But this abolishes the notion of the
Mosaic tabernacle; for according to the law, the two things belong
necessarily to each other; the one cannot exist without the other; both
are of equally great importance. The tabernacle must everywhere
accompany the symbol of its presence; the darkness of the holy of

<span id="page_42">p. 42</span>

holies is at the same time the life-element of the ark; only under
compulsion of necessity, and even then not except under the covering of
the curtains, does it leave its lodging during a march, only to return
to it again as soon as the new halting-place is reached. But according
to 1 Sam. iv. seq., on the other hand, it is only the ark that goes to
the campaign; it alone falls into the hands of the Philistines. Even in
chap. v., where the symbol of Jehovah is placed in the temple of Dagon
at Ashdod, not a word is said of the tabernacle or of the altar which is
necessarily connected with it; and chap. vi. is equally silent, although
here the enemy plainly gives back the whole of his sacred spoil. It is
assumed that the housing of the ark was left behind at Shiloh. Very
likely; but that was not the Mosaic tabernacle, the inseparable
companion of the ark. In fact, the narrator speaks of a permanent house
at Shiloh with doors and doorposts; that possibly may be an
anachronism <span id="fr_22"></span>[1](#fn_22) (yet why?.md); but so much
at least may be inferred from it that he had not any idea of the
tabernacle, which, however, would have had to go with the ark to the
field. If on this one occasion only an illegal exception to the Law was
made, why in that case was not the ark, at least after its surrender,
again restored to the lodging from which, strictly speaking, it ought
never to have been separated at all? Instead of this it is brought to
Bethshemesh, where it causes disaster, because the people show curiosity
about it. Thence it comes to Kirjathjearim, where it stays for many
years in the house of a private person. From here David causes it to be
brought to Jerusalem,—one naturally supposes, if one thinks in the lines
of the view given in the Pentateuch and in Chronicles, in order that it
may be at last restored to the tabernacle, to be simultaneously brought
to Jerusalem. But no thought of this, however obvious it may seem,
occurs to the king. In the first instance, his intention is to have the
ark beside himself in the citadel; but he is terrified out of this, and,
at a loss where else to put it, he at last places it in the house of one
of his principal people, Obed-Edom of Gath. Had he known anything about
the tabernacle, had he had any suspicion that it

<span id="page_43">p. 43</span>

was standing empty at Gibeon, in the immediate neighbourhood, he would
have been relieved of all difficulty. But inasmuch as the ark brings
blessing to the house of Obed-Edom,—the ark, be it remembered, in the
house of a soldier and a Philistine, yet bringing down, not wrath, but
blessing <span id="fr_23"></span>[1](#fn_23.md),—the king is thereby
encouraged to persevere after all with his original proposal, and
establish it upon his citadel. And this he does in a tent he had caused
to be made for it (2 Sam. vi. 17), which tent of David in Zion continued
to be its lodging until the temple was built.

Some mention of the tabernacle, had it existed, would have been
inevitable when the temple took its place. That it did not serve as the
model of the temple has already been said; but it might have been
expected at least that in the account of the building of the new
sanctuary some word might have escaped about the whereabouts of the old.
And this expectation seems to be realised in 1 Kings viii. 4, which says
that when the temple was finished there were brought into it, besides
the ark, the Ohel Moed and all the sacred vessels that were therein.
Interpreters hesitate as to whether they ought to understand by the Ohel
Moed the tent of the ark upon Zion, to which alone reference has been
made in the preceding narrative (1 Kings i. 39, ii. 28-30), or whether
it is the Mosaic tent, which, according to Chronicles, was standing at
Gibeon, but of which the Book of Kings tells nothing, and also knows
nothing (iii. 2-4). It is probable that the author of viii. 4 mixed up
both together; but we have to face the following alternative. Either the
statement belongs to the original context of the narrative in which it
occurs, and in that case the Ohel Moed can only be the tent on Mount
Zion, or the Ohel Moed of 1 Kings viii. 4 is the Mosaic tabernacle which
was removed from Gibeon into Solomon's temple, and in that case the
allegation has no connection with its context, and does not hang
together with the premisses which that furnishes; in other words, it is
the interpolation of a later hand. The former alternative, though
possible, is improbable, for the name Ohel Moed occurs absolutely
nowhere in the Books of Judges, Samuel, and Kings (apart from the
interpolation in 1 Samuel ii. 22 *b*), and particularly it is not used

to denote David's tent upon Mount Zion; and, moreover, that tent had
received too little of the consecration of antiquity, and according to 2
Sam. vii. was too insignificant and provisional to be thought worthy of
preservation in the temple. But if the Ohel Moed is here (what it
everywhere else is) the tabernacle, as is indicated also by the sacred
vessels, then the verse is, as has been said, an interpolation. The
motive for such a thing is easily understood; the same difficulty as
that with which we set out must have made it natural for any Jew who
started from the ideas of the Pentateuch to look for the tabernacle
here, and, if he did not find it, to introduce it. Yet even the
interpolation does not remove the difficulties. Where is the Mosaic
altar of burnt-offering? It was quite as important and holy as the
tabernacle itself; even in Chronicles it is invariably mentioned
expressly in connection with it, and did not deserve to be permitted to
go to ruin at Gibeon, which, from another point of view, would also have
been extremely dangerous to the unity of the sacrificial worship.
Further, if the sacred vessels were transferred from the tabernacle to
the temple, why then was it that Solomon, according to 1 Kings vii.,
cast a completely new set? <span id="fr_24"></span>[1](#fn_24.md) The old
ones were costly enough, in part even costlier than the new, and,
moreover, had been consecrated by long use. It is clear that in
Solomon's time neither tabernacle, nor holy vessels, nor brazen altar of
Moses had any existence.

But if there was no tabernacle in the time of the last judges and first
kings, as little was it in existence during the whole of the previous
period. This is seen from 2 Sam. vii., a section with whose historicity
we have here nothing to do, but which at all events reflects the view of
a pre-exilian author. It is there told that David, after he had obtained
rest from all his enemies, contemplated building a worthy home for the
ark, and expressed his determination to the prophet Nathan in the words,
"I dwell in a house of cedar, and the ark of God within curtains."
According to vi. 17, he can only mean the tent which he had set up, that
is to say, not the Mosaic tabernacle, which, moreover, according to the
description of Exod. xxv. seq., could not

<span id="page_45">p. 45</span>

appropriately be contrasted with a timber erection, still less be
regarded as a mean structure or unworthy of the Deity, for in point of
magnificence it at least competed with the temple of Solomon. Nathan at
first approves of the king's intention, but afterwards discountenances
it, saying that at present God does not wish to have anything different
from that which He has hitherto had. "I have dwelt in no house since the
day that I brought the children of Israel out of Egypt, but have
wandered about under tent and covering." Nathan also, of course, has not
in his eye the Mosaic tabernacle as the present lodging of the ark, but
David's tent upon Zion. Now he does not say that the ark has formerly
been always in the tabernacle, and that its present harbourage is
therefore in the highest degree unlawful, but, on the contrary, that the
present state of matters is the right one,—that until now the ark has
invariably been housed under an equally simple and unpretentious roof.
As David's tent does not date back to the Exodus, Nathan is necessarily
speaking of changing tents and dwellings; the reading of the parallel
passage in 1 Chron. xvii. 5, therefore, correctly interprets the sense.
There could be no more fundamental contradiction to the representation
contained in the Pentateuch than that embodied in these words: the ark
has not as its correlate a single definite sacred tent of state, but is
quite indifferent to the shelter it enjoys—has frequently changed its
abode, but never had any particularly fine one. Such has been the state
of matters since the time of Moses.

Such is the position of affairs as regards the tabernacle; if it is
determined that the age of the Priestly Code is to hang by these
threads, I have no objection. The representation of the tabernacle arose
out of the temple of Solomon as its root, in dependence on the sacred
ark, for which there is early testimony, and which in the time of David,
and also before it, was sheltered by a tent. From the temple it derives
at once its inner character and its central importance for the cultus as
well as its external form.

2\. A peculiar point of view is taken up by Theodor Nöldeke. He grants
the premisses that the tabernacle is a fiction, of which the object is
to give pre-existence to the temple and to the unity of worship, but he
denies the conclusion that in that case the Priestly Code presuppose;
the unity of worship as already existing in its day, and therefore is
late, than Deuteronomy. In his *Untersuchungen zur Kritik des Alten
Testaments* (p. 127 seq.) he says:—

<span id="page_46">p. 46</span>

"A strong tendency towards unity of worship *must* have arisen as soon
as Solomon's temple was built. Over against the splendid sanctuary with
its imageless worship at the centre of the kingdom of Judah, the older
holy places *must* ever have shrunk farther into the background, and
that not merely in the eyes of the people, but quite specially also in
those of the better classes and of those whose spiritual advancement was
greatest (compare Amos iv. 4, viii. 14). If even Hezekiah carried out
the unification in Judah with tolerable thoroughness, the effort after
it *must* surely have been of very early date; for the determination
violently to suppress old sacred usages would not have been easily made,
unless this had been long previously demanded by theory. The priests at
Jerusalem *must* very specially at an early date have arrived at the
conception that their temple with the sacred ark and the great altar was
the one true place of worship, and an author has clothed this very
laudable effort on behalf of the purity of religion in the form of a
law, which certainly in its strictness was quite impracticable (Lev.
xvii. 4 seq.), and which, therefore, was modified later by the
Deuteronomist with a view to practice."

What *must* have happened is of less consequence to know than what
actually took place. Nöldeke relies solely upon the statement of 2 Kings
xviii. 4, 22, that Hezekiah abolished the high places and altars of
Jehovah, and said to Judah and Jerusalem, "Before this altar shall ye
worship in Jerusalem." With reference to that statement doubts have
already been raised above. How startling was the effect produced at a
later date by the similar ordinance of Josiah! Is it likely then that
the other, although the earlier, should have passed off so quietly and
have left so little mark that the reinforcement of it, after an interval
of seventy or eighty years, is not in the least brought into connection
with it, but in every respect figures as a new first step upon a path
until then absolutely untrodden? Note too how casual is the allusion to
a matter which is elsewhere the chief and most favoured theme of the
Book of Kings! And there is besides all this the serious difficulty,
also already referred to above, that the man from whom Hezekiah must,
from the nature of the case, have received the impulse to his
reformatory movement, the prophet Isaiah, in one of his latest
discourses expressly insists on a *cleansing* merely of the local
sanctuaries from molten and graven images, that is to say, does not
desire their complete removal. So much at least is certain that, if the
alleged fact

<span id="page_47">p. 47</span>

at present under discussion amounts to anything at all <span
id="fr_25"></span>[1](#fn_25.md), Hezekiah only made a feeble and wholly
ineffectual attempt in this direction, and by no means "carried out the
unification in Judah with tolerable thoroughness." At the same time, one
might concede even this last point, and yet not give any ground for the
theory at which Nöldeke wishes to arrive.

For his assumption is that the effort after unity had its old and
original seat precisely in the priestly circles of Jerusalem. If the
Priestly Code is older than Deuteronomy, then of course the prophetic
agitation for reform of worship in which Deuteronomy had its origin
*must* have been only the repetition of an older priestly movement in
the same direction. But of the latter we hear not a single word, while
we can follow the course of the former fairly well from its beginnings
in thought down to its issue in a practical result. It was Amos, Hosea,
and Isaiah who introduced the movement against the old popular worship
of the high places; in doing so they are not in the least actuated by a
deep-rooted preference for the temple of Jerusalem, but by ethical
motives, which manifest themselves in them for the first time in
history, and which we can see springing up in them before our very eyes:
their utterances, though historically occasioned by

<span id="page_48">p. 48</span>

the sanctuaries of northern Israel, are quite general, and are directed
against the cultus as a whole. Of the influence of a point of view even
remotely akin to the priestly position that worship in this or that
special place is of more value than anywhere else, and on that account
alone deserves to be preserved, no trace is to be found in them; their
polemic is a purely prophetic one, *i.e.*, individual, "theopneust" in
the sense that it is independent of all traditional and preconceived
human opinions. But the subsequent development is dependent upon this
absolutely original commencement, and has its issue, not in the Priestly
Code, but in Deuteronomy, a book that, with all reasonable regard for
the priests (though not more for those of Jerusalem than for the
others), still does not belie its prophetic origin, and above all things
is absolutely free from all and every hierocratic tendency. And finally,
it was Deuteronomy that brought about the historical result of Josiah's
reformation. Thus the whole historical movement now under our
consideration, so far as it was effective and thereby has come to our
knowledge, is in its origin and essence prophetic, even if latterly it
may have been aided by priestly influences; and it not merely can, but
must be understood from itself. Any older or independent contemporary
priestly movement in the same direction remained at least entirely
without result, and so also has left no witnesses to itself. Perhaps it
occurs to us that the priests of Jerusalem must after all have been the
first to catch sight of the goal, the attainment of which afterwards
brought so great advantage to themselves, but it does not appear that
they were so clever beforehand as we are after the event. At least there
are no other grounds for the hypothesis of a long previously latent
tendency towards centralisation on the part of the Jerusalem priesthood
beyond the presumption that the Priestly Code must chronologically
precede, not Deuteronomy merely, but also the prophets. For the sake of
this presumption there is constructed a purely abstract (and as such
perfectly irrefragable) possibility that furnishes a door of escape from
the historical probability, which nevertheless it is impossible to
evade.

How absolutely unknown the Priestly Code continued to be even down to
the middle of the exile can be seen from the Books of Kings, which
cannot have received their present shape earlier than the death of
Nebuchadnezzar. The redactor, who cites the Deuteronomic law and
constantly forms his judgment in accordance with it, considered (as

<span id="page_49">p. 49</span>

we have learned from 1 Kings iii. 2) that the Bamoth were permissible
prior to the building of Solomon's temple; the tabernacle therefore did
not exist for him. Jeremiah, who flourished about a generation earlier,
is equally ignorant of it, but—on account of the ark, though not
necessarily in agreement with traditional opinion—regards the house of
God at Shiloh (whose ruins, it would seem, were at that time still
visible) as the forerunner of the temple of Jerusalem, and in this he is
followed by the anonymous prophecy of 1 Sam. ii. 27-36, the
comparatively recent date of which appears from the language (ii. 33),
and from the circumstance that it anticipates the following threatening
in iii. In all these writers, and still more in the case of the
Deuteronomist himself, who in xii. actually makes the unity of the
cultus dependent on the previous choice of Jerusalem, it is an
exceedingly remarkable thing that, if the Priestly Code had been then
already a long time in existence, they should have been ignorant of a
book so important and so profound in its practical bearings. In ancient
Hebrew literature such an oversight could not be made so easily as, in
similar circumstances, with the literature of the present day. And how
comes it to pass that in the Book of Chronicles, dating from the third
century, the Priestly Code suddenly ceases to be, to all outward
seeming, dead, but asserts its influence everywhere over the narrative
in only too active and unmistakable a way? To these difficulties Nöldeke
is unreasonably indifferent. He seems to be of the opinion that the
post-exilian time would not have ventured to take in hand so
thoroughgoing an alteration, or rather reconstruction, of tradition as
is implied in antedating the temple of Solomon by means of the
tabernacle. <span id="fr_26"></span>[1](#fn_26.md) But it is, on the
contrary, precisely the mark which distinguished the post-exile writers
that they treat in the freest possible manner, in accordance with their
own ideas, the institutions of the bygone past, with which their time
was no longer connected by any living bond. For what reason does
Chronicles stand in the canon at all, if not in order to teach us this?

But when Nöldeke excuses the ignorance with regard to the tabernacle on
the plea that it is a mere creature of the brain, <span
id="fr_27"></span>[2](#fn_27.md) he for the

<span id="page_50">p. 50</span>

moment forgets that there underlies this creation the very real idea of
unity of worship, for the sake of which it would surely have been very
welcome, to the Deuteronomist, for example, even as a mere idea. It is
only the embodiment of the tabernacle that is fancy; the idea of it
springs from the ground of history, and it is by its idea that it is to
be apprehended. And when Nöldeke finally urges in this connection as a
plea for the priority of the Priestly Code that, in spite of the
limitation of sacrifice to a single locality, it nevertheless maintains
the old provision that every act of killing must be a sacrifice, while
Deuteronomy, going a step farther, departs from this, here also his
argument breaks down.

For we read in Lev. xvii., "What man soever there be of the house of
Israel that killeth an ox or sheep or goat in the camp, or out of the
camp, and bringeth it not to the door of the tabernacle, to offer them
as an offering unto the Lord before the tabernacle of the Lord, blood
shall be imputed unto that man: he hath shed blood, and that man shall
be cut off from among his people: to the end that the children of Israel
may bring their sacrifices which they offer in the open field, even that
they may bring them to the Lord, to the door of the tabernacle, to the
priest, and offer them for peace-offerings unto the Lord. . . . And they
shall no more offer sacrifices unto devils, after whom they have gone a
whoring." The intention of this prescription is simply and solely to
secure the exclusive legitimation of the one lawful place of sacrifice;
it is only for this, obviously, that the profane slaughtering outside of
Jerusalem, which Deuteronomy had permitted, is forbidden. Plainly the
common man did not quite understand the newly drawn and previously quite
unknown distinction between the religious and the profane act, and when
he slaughtered at home (as he was entitled to do), he in doing so still
observed, half-unconsciously perhaps, the old sacred sacrificial ritual.
From this arose the danger of a multiplicity of altars again furtively
creeping in, and such a danger is met, in an utterly impracticable way
indeed, in Lev. xvii. And it is worth noticing how much this law, which,
for the rest, is based upon the Book of Deuteronomy, has grown in the
narrowness of its legitimistic mode of viewing things. Deuteronomy
thoroughly recognises that offerings, even though offered outside of
Jerusalem, are still offered to Jehovah; for the author of Lev. xvii.
this is an impossible idea, and he regards such offerings simply as made
to

<span id="page_51">p. 51</span>

devils. <span id="fr_28"></span>[1](#fn_28.md) I refuse to believe that any
such thing could have been possible for one who lived before the
Deuteronomic reformation, or even under the old conditions that were in
existence immediately before the exile.

Lev. xvii., moreover, belongs confessedly to a peculiar little
collection of laws, which has indeed been taken up into the Priestly
Code, but which in many respects disagrees with it, and particularly in
respect of this prohibition of profane slaughterings. With reference to
the Priestly Code as a whole, Nöldeke's assertion is quite off the mark.
The code, on the contrary, already allows slaughter without sacrifice in
the precepts of Noah, which are valid not merely for all the world, but
also for the Jews. Farther on this permission is not expressly repeated
indeed, but it is regarded as a thing of course. This alone can account
for the fact that the thank-offering is treated so entirely as a
subordinate affair and the sacrificial meal almost ignored, while in
Lev. vii. 22-27 rules are even given for procedure in the slaughter of
such animals as are not sacrificed. <span id="fr_29"></span>[2](#fn_29.md)
Here accordingly is another instance of what we have already so often
observed: what is brought forward in Deuteronomy as an innovation is
assumed in the Priestly Code to be an ancient custom dating as far back
as to Noah. And therefore the latter code is a growth of the soil that
has been prepared by means of the former.

<span id="fn_6"></span>[19:1](phai04.htm#fr_6.md) Compare 1 Kings viii. 16.
According to Deut. xii. 10 seq., the local unity of <span
id="page_20">p. 20</span> worship becomes law from the time when the
Israelites have found rest (menuḥa). Comparing 2 Sam. vii. 11 and 1
Kings v. 18 (A.V., v. 4), we find that "menuḥa" first came in with David
and Solomon. The period of the judges must at that time have been
regarded as much shorter than appears in the present chronology.

<span id="fn_7"></span>[22:1](phai04.htm#fr_7.md) Gen. iv. 14, 16: when
Cain is driven out of the land (Canaan), he is driven from the presence
of Jehovah (Jonah i. 3, 10). Gen. xlvi. 4: Jacob is not to hesitate
about going down into Egypt, for Jehovah will, by a special act of
grace, change His dwelling-place along with him. Exodus xv. 17: "Thou
broughtest thy people to the mountain of thine inheritance, to the place
which thou hadst prepared for thyself to dwell in," the explanation
which follows, "to the sanctuary which thy hand had established," is out
of place, for the mountain of the inheritance can only be the
mountainous land of Palestine. 1 Sam. xxvi. 19: David, driven by Saul
into foreign parts, is thereby violently sundered from his family share
in the inheritance of Jehovah, and compelled to serve other gods. Hos.
viii. 1: one like an eagle comes against the house of Jehovah, *i.e.*,
the Assyrian comes against Jehovah's land. Hos. ix. 15: "I will drive
them out of mine house," *i.e.*, the Israelites out of their land. Most
distinct is the language of Hos. ix. 3-5: "They shall not continue to
dwell in Jehovah's land; Ephraim must back to Egypt, and must eat that
which is unclean in Assyria. They shall not any more offer
wine-offerings to Jehovah, or set forth offerings \[read with Kuenen
‏יערכו‎ for ‏יערבו‎\] before Him; their bread is as the bread of
mourners; whosoever eats of it is polluted, for their bread shall be
only for the staying of hunger, and shall not be brought into the house
of Jehovah. What indeed will ye do in the time of the solemn assembly
and in the day of the feast of Jehovah? "Compare Jer. xvi. 13; Ezek. iv.
13; Mal. ii. 11; 2 Kings xvii. 25 seq. It is also possible that the
"great indignation" of 2 Kings iii. 27 is regarded less as Jehovah's
than as that of Chemosh, in whose land the army of Israel is at the
time.

<span id="fn_8"></span>[24:1](phai04.htm#fr_8.md) Nearly all the Judæan
narratives in the Books of Kings relate to the temple and the measures
taken by the ruling princes with reference to this their sanctuary.

<span id="fn_9"></span>[26:1](phai04.htm#fr_9.md) While Hosea, the man of
northern Israel, frequently assails the clergy of his home, and lays
upon them the chief share of the blame for the depraved and blinded
condition of the people, Isaiah even in his fiercest declamation against
the superstitious worship of the multitude, has not a word to say
against the priests, with whose chief, Uriah, on the contrary, he stands
in a relation of great intimacy. But it is from the Book of Jeremiah,
the best mirror of the contemporary relations in Judah, that the close
connection between priests and prophets can be gathered most
particularly. To a certain extent they shared the possession of the
sanctuary between them. (Compare Lam. ii. 20.)

<span id="fn_10"></span>[27:1](phai04.htm#fr_10.md) Luther in his address
to the princes of Germany counsels in the twentieth place that the field
chapels and churches be destroyed, as devices of the devil used by him
to strengthen covetousness, to set up a false and spurious faith, to
weaken parochial churches, to increase taverns and fornication, to
squander money and labour to no purpose, and merely to lead the poor
people about by the nose. (Niemeyer's Reprint, p. 54.)

<span id="fn_11"></span>[29:1](phai04.htm#fr_11.md) The altar of the second
temple had no steps, but a sloping ascent to it, as also, according to
the belief of the Jews, had that of the tabernacle. The reason,
moreover, for which in Exodus xx. 26 steps are forbidden, disappears
when the priests are provided with breeches (Exod. xxviii. 42).

<span id="fn_12"></span>[29:2](phai04.htm#fr_12.md) The plural "stones" is
perhaps worthy of note. There were also sacrificial places consisting of
*one* great stone (1 Sam. xiv. 33, vi. 14, 15; 2 Sam. xx. 8; Judges vi.
20, xiii. 19, 20; 1 Kings i. 9); to the same category also doubtless
belongs originally the threshing-floor of Araunah, 2 Sam. xxiv. 21;
compare Ezra iii. 3, ‏על מכונתו‎. But inasmuch as such single sacred
stones easily came into a mythological relation to the Deity, offence
was taken at them, as appears from Judges vi. 22-24, where the rock
altar, the stone under the oak which was conceived of as the seat of the
theophany, upon which Gideon offers, and out of which the flame issues
(vi. 19-21), is corrected into an altar upon the rock. The maççeboth are
distinguished from the altar in Exod. xxiv. 4, yet elsewhere clearly put
on the same plane with it (Gen. xxxiii. 20), and everywhere more or less
identified with the Deity (Gen. xxviii.).

<span id="fn_13"></span>[31:1](phai04.htm#fr_13.md) The correct explanation
of this is found in Ewald, *Gesch. d. V. Israels*, i. 436 seq. (3d
edit.). A. Bernstein (*Ursprung der Sagen von Abraham*, etc., Berlin,
1871) drags in politics in a repulsive way. "He does not indeed actually
enter Shechem and Bethel—these are places hostile to Judah—but in a
genuine spirit of Jewish demonstration he builds altars in their
vicinity and calls on the name of Jehovah" (p. 22). Rather, he builds
the altars precisely on the places where, as can be shown, they
afterwards stood, and that was not inside the towns. In Gen. xviii. also
the oak of Mamre is employed to fix not Abraham's residence, but the
place of Jehovah's appearing.

<span id="fn_14"></span>[32:1](phai04.htm#fr_14.md) But it is only the
public cultus and that of certain leading sanctuaries that is thus
glorified; on the other hand, the domestic worship of seraphim, to which
the women are specially attached, is already discountenanced (in E) by
Jacob. Asherim are not alluded to, molten images are rejected,
particularly by E. Here perhaps a correction of the ancient legend has
already taken place in JE.

<span id="fn_15"></span>[34:1](phai04.htm#fr_15.md) De Wette, in the fifth
place of his *Habilitationsschrift über das Deuteronomium* (Jena, 1805):
"De hoc unico cultus sacri loco. . . priores libri nihil omnino habent.
De sacrificiis tantum unice ante tabernaculum conventus offerendis lex
quædam extat. Sed in legibus de diebus festis, de primitiis et decimis,
tam sæpe repetitis, nihil omnino monitum est de loco unico, ubi
celebrari et offerri debeant" (*Opusc. Theol.*, p. 163-165).

<span id="fn_16"></span>[35:1](phai04.htm#fr_16.md) Except in Lev. xvii.;
but the small body of legislation contained in Lev. xvii-xxvi is the
transition from Deuteronomy to the Priestly Code.

<span id="fn_17"></span>[37:1](phai04.htm#fr_17.md) In Wisdom of Solomon
ix. 8 the temple is called μίμημα σκηνῆς ἁγίας. Josephus (*Ant.* iii. 6,
1) says of the tabernacle, ἢ δ᾽ οὐδὲν μεταφερομένου καὶ
συμπερινοστοῦντος ναοῦ διέφερε.

<span id="fn_18"></span>[39:1](phai04.htm#fr_18.md) It is never, however,
employed for legislative purposes, but is simply a shelter for the ark;
it stands without the camp, as the oldest sanctuaries were wont to do
outside the cities. It is kept by Joshua as *ædituus*, who sleeps in it,
as did Samuel the *ædituus* for Eli.

<span id="fn_19"></span>[40:1](phai04.htm#fr_19.md) Josh. xxiv. 24, 33
(LXX): after the death of Joshua and Eleazar, λαβόντες οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραηλ
τὴν κιβωτὸν τοῦ θεοῦ περιεφέροσαν ἐν ἐαυτοῖς. After J. Buxtorf and Sal.
van Til (Ugol., *Thes*. viii.), this theory has been, worked out
specially by Movers. See, on the other hand, De Wette, *Beiträge*, p.
108 seq., and Vatke, *ut supra*, p. 316, note.

<span id="fn_20"></span>[41:1](phai04.htm#fr_20.md) Of the priests at Nob,
Abiathar alone escaped the massacre (1 Sam. xxii.); Gad therefore was
not one of them.

<span id="fn_21"></span>[41:2](phai04.htm#fr_21.md) The passage does not
occur in the LXX, and everywhere else in 1 Sam. i-iii the sanctuary of
Shiloh is called hēkal, that is to say, certainly not a tent.

<span id="fn_22"></span>[42:1](phai04.htm#fr_22.md) Compare similar
passages in Josh. vi. 19, 24, ix. 27, where the very anachronism shows
that the idea of the tabernacle was unknown to the narrator. That,
moreover. a permanent house did actually exist then at Shiloh follows
from the circumstance that Jeremiah (vii. 12) speaks of its ruins. For
he could not regard any other than a pre-Solomonic sanctuary as
preceding that of Jerusalem; and besides, there is not the faintest
trace of a more important temple having arisen at Shiloh within the
period of the kings.

<span id="fn_23"></span>[43:1](phai04.htm#fr_23.md) The Chronicle has good
reason for making him a Levite. But Gath without any qualifying epithet,
and particularly in connection with David, is the Philistine Gath, and
Obed-Edom belongs to the bodyguard, which consisted chiefly of
foreigners and Philistines. His name, moreover, is hardly Israelite.

<span id="fn_24"></span>[44:1](phai04.htm#fr_24.md) The brazen altar cast
by Solomon (1 Kings viii. 64; 2 Kings xvi. 14, 15) is not now found in
the inventory of the temple furniture in 1 Kings vii.; but originally it
cannot have been absent, for it is the most important article. It has
therefore been struck out in order to avoid collision with the brazen
altar of Moses. The deletion is the negative counterpart to the
interpolation of the tabernacle in 1 Kings viii. 4.

<span id="fn_25"></span>[47:1](phai04.htm#fr_25.md) Little importance is to
be attached to 2 Kings xviii. 22. The narrative of the Assyrian siege of
Jerusalem is not a contemporary one, as appears generally from the
entirely indefinite character of the statements about the sudden
withdrawal of the Assyrians and its causes, and particularly from xix.
7, 36, 37. For in this passage the meaning certainly is that Sennacherib
was assassinated soon after the unsuccessful expedition of 701, but in
point of fact he actually reigned until 684 or 681 (Smith, *Assyrian
Eponym Canon*, pp. 90, 170). Thus the narrator writes not twenty years
merely after the event, but so long after it as to make possible the
elision of those twenty years: probably he is already under the
influence of Deuteronomy. 2 Kings xviii. 4 is certainly of greater
weight than 2 Kings xviii. 22. But although highly authentic statements
have been preserved to us in the epitome of the Book of Kings, they have
all, nevertheless, been subjected not merely to the selection, but also
to the revision of the Deuteronomic redactor, and it may very well be
that the author thought himself justified in giving his subject a
generalised treatment, according to which the cleansing (of the temple
at Jerusalem in the first instance) from idols, urged by Isaiah and
carried out by Hezekiah, was changed into an abolition of the Bamoth
with their Maççeboth and Asherim. It is well known how indifferent later
writers are to distinctions of time and degree in the heresy of unlawful
worship; they always go at once to the completed product. But in actual
experience the reformation was doubtless accomplished step by step. At
first we have in Hosea and Isaiah the polemic directed against molten
and graven images, then in Jeremiah that against wood and stone, *i.e.*,
against Maççeboth and Asherim; the movement originated with the
prophets, and the chief, or rather the only, weight is to be attached to
their authentic testimony.

<span id="fn_26"></span>[49:1](phai04.htm#fr_26.md) *Jahrb. für prot.
Theol.*, i. p. 352: "And now let me ask whether a document of this kind

rural demons, compare my note in *Vakidi's Maghazi* (Berlin, 1882), p.

to demons.

not a repetition of the old and fuller regulations about the
thank-offering, but an appendix containing new ones relating to
slaughtering, is clear from "the beast of which men offer an offering
unto the Lord" (ver. 25), and "in all your dwellings" (ver. 26), as well
as from the praxis of Judaism.
