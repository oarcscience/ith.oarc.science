*Prolegomena to the History of Ancient Israel*, by Julius Wellhausen,

### INTRODUCTION.

<span class="smallcaps">In</span> the following pages it is proposed to
discuss the place in history of the "law of Moses;" more precisely, the
question to be considered is whether that law is the starting-point for
the history of ancient Israel, or not rather for that of Judaism,
*i.e.*, of the religious communion which survived the destruction of the
nation by the Assyrians and Chaldæans.

I. It is an opinion very extensively held that the great mass of the
books of the Old Testament not only relate to the pre-exilic period, but
date from it. According to this view, they are remnants of the
literature of ancient Israel which the Jews rescued as a heritage from
the past, and on which they continued to subsist in the decay of
independent intellectual life. In dogmatic theology Judaism is a mere
empty chasm over which one springs from the Old Testament to the New;
and even where this estimate is modified, the belief still prevails in a
general way that the Judaism which received the books of Scripture into
the canon had, as a rule, nothing to do with their production. But the
exceptions to this principle which are conceded as regards the second
and third divisions of the Hebrew canon cannot be called so very slight.
Of the Hagiographa, by far the larger portion is demonstrably
post-exilic, and no part demonstrably older than the exile. Daniel comes
as far down as the Maccabæan wars, and Esther is perhaps even later. Of
the prophetical literature a very appreciable fraction is later than the
fall of the Hebrew kingdom; and the associated historical books (the
"earlier prophets" of the Hebrew canon) date, in the form in which we
now possess them, from a period subsequent to the death of Jeconiah, who
must have survived the year 560 B.C. for some time. Making all allowance
for the older sources utilised, and to a large extent transcribed word
for word, in Judges,

<span id="page_2">p. 2</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Samuel, and Kings,
we find that apart from the Pentateuch the pre-exilic portion of the Old
Testament amounts in bulk to little more than the half of the entire
volume. All the rest belongs to the later period, and it includes not
merely the feeble after-growths of a failing vegetation, but also
productions of the vigour and originality of Isa. xl.-lxvi. and Ps.
lxxiii.

We come then to the Law. Here, as for most parts of the Old Testament,
we have no express information as to the author and date of composition,
and to get even approximately at the truth we are shut up to the use of
such data as can be derived from an analysis of the contents, taken in
conjunction with what we may happen to know from other sources as to the
course of Israel's history. But the habit has been to assume that the
historical period to be considered in this connection ends with the
Babylonian exile as certainly as it begins with the exodus from Egypt.
At first sight this assumption seems to be justified by the history of
the canon; it was the Law that first became canonical through the
influence of Ezra and Nehemiah; the Prophets became so considerably
later, and the Hagiographa last of all. Now it is not unnatural, from
the chronological order in which these writings were received into the
canon, to proceed to an inference as to their approximate relative age,
and so not only to place the Prophets before the Hagiographa, but also
the five books of Moses before the Prophets. If the Prophets are for the
most part older than the exile, how much more so the Law! But however
trustworthy such a mode of comparison may be when applied to the middle
as contrasted with the latest portion of the canon, it is not at all to
be relied on when the first part is contrasted with the other two. The
very idea of canonicity was originally associated with the Torah, and
was only afterwards extended to the other books, which slowly and by a
gradual process acquired a certain measure of the validity given to the
Torah by a single public and formal act, through which it was introduced
at once as the Magna Charta of the Jewish communion (Neh. viii.-x.) In
their case the canonical—that is, legal—character was not intrinsic, but
was only subsequently acquired; there must therefore have been some
interval, and there may have been a very long one, between the date of
their origin and that of their receiving public sanction. To the Law, on
the other hand, the canonical character is much more essential, and
serious difficulties beset the assumption

<span id="page_3">p. 3</span>

that the Law of Moses came into existence at a period long before the
exile, and did not attain the force of law until many centuries
afterwards, and in totally different circumstances from those under
which it had arisen. At least the fact that a collection claiming public
recognition as an ecclesiastical book should have attained such
recognition earlier than other writings which make no such claim is no
proof of superior antiquity.

We cannot, then, peremptorily refuse to regard it as possible that what
was the law of Judaism may also have been its product; and there are
urgent reasons for taking the suggestion into very careful
consideration. It may not be out of place here to refer to personal
experience. In my early student days I was attracted by the stories of
Saul and David, Ahab and Elijah; the discourses of Amos and Isaiah laid
strong hold on me, and I read myself well into the prophetic and
historical books of the Old Testament. Thanks to such aids as were
accessible to me, I even considered that I understood them tolerably,
but at the same time was troubled with a bad conscience, as if I were
beginning with the roof instead of the foundation; for I had no thorough
acquaintance with the Law, of which I was accustomed to be told that it
was the basis and postulate of the whole literature. At last I took
courage and made my way through Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and even
through Knobel's *Commentary* to these books. But it was in vain that I
looked for the light which was to be shed from this source on the
historical and prophetical books. On the contrary, my enjoyment of the
latter was marred by the Law; it did not bring them any nearer me, but
intruded itself uneasily, like a ghost that makes a noise indeed, but is
not visible and really effects nothing. Even where there were points of
contact between it and them, differences also made themselves felt, and
I found it impossible to give a candid decision in favour of the
priority of the Law. Dimly I began to perceive that throughout there was
between them all the difference that separates two wholly distinct
worlds. Yet, so far from attaining clear conceptions, I only fell into
deeper confusion, which was worse confounded by the explanations of
Ewald in the second volume of his *History of Israel*. At last, in the
course of a casual visit in Göttingen in the summer of 1867, I learned
through Ritschl that Karl Heinrich Graf placed the law later than the
Prophets, and, almost without knowing his reasons for the hypothesis, I
was prepared to accept it;

<span id="page_4">p. 4</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> I readily
acknowledged to myself the possibility of understanding Hebrew antiquity
without the book of the Torah.

The hypothesis usually associated with Graf's name is really not his,
but that of his teacher, Eduard Reuss. It would be still more correct to
call it after Leopold George and Wilhelm Vatke, who, independent alike
of Reuss and of each other, were the first to give it literary currency.
All three, again, are disciples of Martin Lebrecht de Wette, the
epoch-making pioneer of historical criticism in this field. <span
id="fr_0"></span>[1](#fn_0.md) He indeed did not himself succeed in
reaching a sure position, but he was the first

<span id="page_5">p. 5</span>

clearly to perceive and point out how disconnected are the alleged
starting-point of Israel's history and that history itself. The
religious community set up on so broad a basis in the wilderness, with
its sacred centre and uniform organisation, disappears and leaves no
trace as soon as Israel settles in a land of its own, and becomes, in
any proper sense, a nation. The period of the Judges presents itself to
us as a confused chaos, out of which order and coherence are gradually
evolved under the pressure of external circumstances, but perfectly
naturally and without the faintest reminiscence of a sacred unifying
constitution that had formerly existed. Hebrew antiquity shows
absolutely no tendencies towards a hierocracy; power is wielded solely
by the heads of families and of tribes, and by the kings, who exercise
control over religious worship also, and appoint and depose its priests.
The influence possessed by the latter is purely moral; the Torah of God
is not a document in their hands which guarantees their own position,
but merely an instruction for others in their mouths; like the word of
the prophets, it has divine authority but not political sanction, and
has validity only in so far as it is voluntarily accepted. And as for
the literature which has come down to us from the period of the Kings,
it would puzzle the very best intentions to beat up so many as two or
three unambiguous allusions to the Law, and these cannot be held to
prove anything when one considers, by way of contrast, what Homer was to
the Greeks.

To complete the marvel, in post-exile Judaism the Mosaism which until
then had been only latent suddenly emerges into prominence everywhere.
We now find the Book regarded as the foundation of all higher life, and
the Jews, to borrow the phrase of the Koran, are "the people of the
Book;" we have the sanctuary with its priests and Levites occupying the
central position, and the people as a congregation encamped around it;
the cultus, with its burnt-offerings and sin-offerings, its
purifications and its abstinences, its feasts and Sabbaths, strictly
observed as prescribed by the Law, is now the principal business of
life. When we take the community of the second temple and compare it
with the ancient people of Israel, we are at once able to realise how
far removed was the latter from so-called Mosaism. The Jews themselves
were thoroughly conscious of the distance. The revision of the books of
Judges, Samuel, and Kings, undertaken towards the end of the Babylonian
exile, a revision much more thorough than is commonly assumed, condemns
as heretical the whole age of the Kings. At a later date, as the past

<span id="page_6">p. 6</span>

became more invested with a certain nimbus of sanctity, men preferred to
clothe it with the characters of legitimacy rather than sit in judgment
upon it. The Book of Chronicles shows in what manner it was necessary to
deal with the history of bygone times when it was assumed that the
Mosaic hierocracy was their fundamental institution.

2\. The foregoing remarks are designed merely to make it plain that the
problem we have set before us is not an imaginary one, but actual and
urgent. They are intended to introduce it; but to solve it is by no
means so easy. The question what is the historical place of the Law does
not even admit of being put in these simple terms. For the Law, If by
that word we understand the entire Pentateuch, is no literary unity, and
no simple historical quantity. <span id="fr_1"></span>[1](#fn_1.md) Since
the days of Peyrerius and Spinoza, criticism has acknowledged the
complex character of that remarkable literary production, and from Jean
Astruc onwards has laboured, not without success, at disentangling its
original elements. At present there are a number of results that can be
regarded as settled. The following are some of them. The five Books of
Moses and the Book of Joshua constitute one whole, the conquest of the
Promised Land rather than the death of Moses forming the true conclusion
of the patriarchal history, the exodus, and the wandering in the
wilderness. From a literary point of view, accordingly, it is more
accurate to speak of the Hexateuch than of the Pentateuch. Out of this
whole, the Book of Deuteronomy, as essentially an independent law-book,
admits of being separated most easily. Of what remains, the parts most
easily distinguished belong to the so-called "main stock"
("Grundschrift"), formerly also called the Elohistic document, on
account of the use it makes of the divine name Elohim up to the time of
Moses, and designated by Ewald, with reference to the regularly
recurring superscriptions in Genesis, as the Book of Origins. It is
distinguished by its liking for number, and measure, and formula
generally, by its stiff pedantic style, by its constant use of certain
phrases and turns of expression which do not occur elsewhere in the
older Hebrew; its characteristics are more strongly marked than those of
any of the others, and make it accordingly the easiest to recognise with
certainty. Its basis is the Book of Leviticus and the allied portions of
the adjoining books,—Exod. xxv.-xl., with the exception of chaps.
xxxii.-xxxiv., and Num. i.-x., xv.-xix.,

<span id="page_7">p. 7</span>

xxv.-xxxvi., with trifling exceptions. It thus contains legislation
chiefly, and, in point of fact, relates substantially to the worship of
the tabernacle and cognate matters. It is historical only in form; the
history serves merely as a framework on which to arrange the legislative
material, or as a mask to disguise it. For the most part, the thread of
the narrative is extremely thin, and often serves merely to carry out
the chronology, which is kept up without a hiatus from the Creation to
the Exodus; it becomes fuller only on the occasions in which other
interests come into play, as, for example, in Genesis, with regard to
the three preludes to the Mosaic covenant which are connected with the
names of Adam, Noah, and Abraham respectively. When this fundamental
document is also separated out as well as Deuteronomy, there remains the
Jehovistic history-book, which, in contrast with the two others, is
essentially of a narrative character, and sets forth with full sympathy
and enjoyment the materials handed down by tradition. The story of the
patriarchs, which belongs to this document almost entirely, is what best
marks its character; that story is not here dealt with merely as a
summary introduction to something of greater importance which is to
follow, but as a subject of primary importance, deserving the fullest
treatment possible. Legislative elements have been taken into it only at
one point, where they fit into the historical connection, namely, when
the giving of the Law at Sinai is spoken of (Exod. xx.-xxiii., xxxiv.)

Scholars long rested satisfied with this twofold division of the
non-Deuteronomic Hexateuch, until Hupfeld demonstrated in certain parts
of Genesis, which until then had been assigned partly to the "main
stock" and partly to the Jehovist, the existence of a third continuous
source, the work of the so-called younger Elohist. The choice of this
name was due to the circumstance that in this document also Elohim is
the ordinary name of the Deity, as it is in the "main stock" up to Exod.
vi.; the epithet "younger," however, is better left out, as it involves
an unproved assumption, and besides, is no longer required for
distinction's sake, now that the "main stock" is no longer referred to
under so unsuitable a name as that of Elohist. Hupfeld further assumed
that all the three sources continued to exist separately until some one
at a later date brought them together simultaneously into a single
whole. But this is a view that cannot be maintained: not merely is the
Elohist in his matter and in his manner of looking at things most
closely akin to the Jehovist;

<span id="page_8">p. 8</span>

his document has come down to us as Nöldeke was the first to perceive,
only in extracts embodied in the Jehovist narrative. <span
id="fr_2"></span>[1](#fn_2.md) Thus, notwithstanding Hupfeld's discovery,
the old division into two great sections continues to hold good, and
there is every reason for adhering to this primary distinction as the
basis of further historical research, in spite of the fact, which is
coming to be more and more clearly perceived, that not only the
Jehovistic document, but the "main stock" as well, are complex products,
and that alongside of them occur hybrid or posthumous elements which do
not admit of being simply referred to either the one or the other
formation. <span id="fr_3"></span>[2](#fn_3.md)

Now the Law, whose historical position we have to determine, is the
so-called "main stock," which, both by its contents and by its origin,
is entitled to be called the Priestly Code, and will accordingly be so
designated. The Priestly Code preponderates over the rest of the
legislation in force, as well as in bulk; in all matters of primary
importance it is the normal and final authority. It was according to the
mode furnished by it that the Jews under Ezra ordered their sacred
community, and upon it are formed our conceptions of the Mosaic
theocracy, with the tabernacle at its centre, the high priest at its
head, the priests and Levites as its organs, the legitimate cultus as
its

<span id="page_9">p. 9</span>

regular function. It is precisely this Law, so called par excellence,
that creates the difficulties out of which our problem rises, and it is
only in connection with it that the great difference of opinion exists
as to date. With regard to the Jehovistic document, all are happily
agreed that, substantially at all events, in language, horizon, and
other features, it dates from the golden age of Hebrew literature, to
which the finest parts of Judges, Samuel, and Kings, and the oldest
extant prophetical writings also belong,—the period of the kings and
prophets which preceded the dissolution of the two Israelite kingdoms by
the Assyrians. About the origin of Deuteronomy there is still less
dispute; in all circles where appreciation of scientific results can be
looked for at all, it is recognised that it was composed in the same age
as that in which it was discovered, and that it was made the rule of
Josiah's reformation, which took place about a generation before the
destruction of Jerusalem by the Chaldæans. It is only in the case of the
Priestly Code that opinions differ widely; for it tries hard to imitate
the costume of the Mosaic period, and, with whatever success, to
disguise its own. This is not nearly so much the case with Deuteronomy,
which, in fact, allows the real situation (that of the period during
which, Samaria having been destroyed, only the kingdom of Judah
continued to subsist) to reveal itself very plainly through that which
is assumed (xii. 8, xix. 8). And the Jehovist does not even pretend to
being a Mosaic law of any kind; it aims at being a simple book of
history; the distance between the present and the past spoken of is not
concealed in the very least. It is here that all the marks are found
which attracted the attention of Abenezra and afterwards of Spinoza,
such as Gen. xii. 6 ("And the Canaanite was then in the land"), Gen.
xxxvi. 31 ("These are the kings who reigned in Edom before the children
of Israel had a king"), Num. xii. 6, 7, Deut. xxxiv. 10 ("There arose
not a prophet since in Israel like unto Moses"). The Priestly Code, on
the other hand, guards itself against all reference to later times and
settled life in Canaan, which both in the Jehovistic Book of the
Covenant (Exod. xxi.-xxiii.) and in Deuteronomy are the express basis of
the legislation: it keeps itself carefully and strictly within the
limits of the situation in the wilderness, for which in all seriousness
it seeks to give the law. It has actually been successful, with its
movable tabernacle, its wandering camp, and other archaic details, in so
concealing the true date of its composition that its many serious
inconsistencies with what we know,

<span id="page_10">p. 10</span>

from other sources, of Hebrew antiquity previous to the exile, are only
taken as proving that it lies far beyond all known history, and on
account of its enormous antiquity can hardly be brought into any
connection with it. It is the Priestly Code, then, that presents us with
our problem.

3\. The instinct was a sound one which led criticism for the time being
to turn aside from the historical problem which had originally presented
itself to De Wette, and afterwards had been more distinctly apprehended
by George and Vatke, in order, in the first instance, to come to some
sort of clear understanding as to the composition of the Pentateuch. But
a mistake was committed when it was supposed that by a separation of the
sources (in which operation attention was quite properly directed
chiefly to Genesis) that great historical question had been incidentally
answered. The fact was, that it had been merely put to sleep, and Graf
has the credit of having, after a considerable interval, awakened it
again. In doing so, indeed, he in turn laboured under the disadvantage
of not knowing what success had been achieved in separating the sources,
and thereby he became involved in a desperate and utterly untenable
assumption. This assumption, however, had no necessary connection with
his own hypothesis, and at once fell to the ground when the level to
which Hupfeld brought the criticism of the text had been reached. Graf
originally followed the older view, espoused by Tuch in particular, that
in Genesis the Priestly Code, with its so obtrusively bare skeleton, is
the "main stock," and that it is the Jehovist who supplements, and is
therefore of course the later. But since, on the other hand, he regarded
the ritual legislature of the middle books as much more recent than the
work of the Jehovist, he was compelled to tear it asunder as best he
could from its introduction in Genesis, and to separate the two halves
of the Priestly Code by half a millennium. But Hupfeld had long before
made it quite clear that the Jehovist is no mere supplementer, but the
author of a perfectly independent work, and that the passages, such as
Gen. xx.-xxii., usually cited as examples of the way in which the
Jehovist worked over the "main stock," really proceed from quite another
source,—the Elohist. Thus the stumbling-block of Graf had already been
taken out of the way, and his path had been made clear by an
unlooked-for ally. Following Kuenen's suggestion, he did not hesitate to
take the helping-hand extended to him; he gave up his violent division
of the Priestly

<span id="page_11">p. 11</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Code, and then had
no difficulty in deducing from the results which he had obtained with
respect to the main legal portion similar consequences with regard to
the narrative part in Genesis. <span id="fr_4"></span>[1](#fn_4.md)

The foundations were now laid; it is Kuenen who has since done most for
the further development of the hypothesis. <span
id="fr_5"></span>[2](#fn_5.md)

The defenders of the prevailing opinion maintained their ground as well
as they could, but from long possession had got somewhat settled on
their lees. They raised against the assailants a series of objections,
all of which, however, laboured more or less under the disadvantage that
they rested upon the foundation which had already been shattered.
Passages were quoted from Amos and Hosea as implying an acquaintance
with the Priestly Code, but they were not such as could make any
impression on those who were already persuaded that the latter was the
more recent. Again it was asserted, and almost with violence, that the
Priestly Code could not be later than Deuteronomy, and that the
Deuteronomist actually had it before him. But the evidences of this
proved extremely problematical, while, on the other hand, the dependence
of Deuteronomy, as a whole, on the Jehovist came out with the utmost
clearness. Appeal was made to the latest redaction of the entire
Hexateuch, a redaction which was assumed to be Deuteronomistic; but this
yielded the result that the deuteronomistic redaction could nowhere be
traced in any of the parts belonging to the Priestly Code. Even the
history of the language itself was forced to render service against
Graf: it had already been too much the custom to deal with that as if it
were soft wax. To say all in a word, the arguments which were brought
into play as a rule derived all their force from a moral conviction that
the ritual legislation *must* be old, and

<span id="page_12">p. 12</span>

*could* not possibly have been committed to writing for the first time
within the period of Judaism; that it was not operative before then,
that it did not even admit of being carried into effect in the
conditions that prevailed previous to the exile, could not shake the
conviction—all the firmer because it did not rest on argument—that at
least it existed previously.

The firemen never came near the spot where the conflagration raged; for
it is only within the region of religious antiquities and dominant
religious ideas,—the region which Vatke in his *Biblische Theologie* had
occupied in its full breadth, and where the real battle first
kindled—that the controversy can be brought to a definite issue. In
making the following attempt in this direction, I start from the
comparison of the three constituents of the Pentateuch,—the Priestly
Code, Deuteronomy, and the work of the Jehovist. The contents of the
first two are, of course, legislation, as we have seen; those of the
third are narrative; but, as the Decalogue (Exod. xx.), the Law of the
two Tables (Exod. xxxiv.), and the Book of the Covenant (Exodus
xxi.-xxiii.) show, the legislative element is not wholly absent from the
Jehovist, and much less is the historical absent from the Priestly Code
or Deuteronomy. Further, each writer's legal standpoint is mirrored in
his account of the history, and conversely; thus there is no lack either
of indirect or of direct points of comparison. Now it is admitted that
the three constituent elements are separated from each other by wide
intervals; the question then arises, In what order? Deuteronomy stands
in a relation of comparative nearness both to the Jehovist and to the
Priestly Code; the distance between the last two is by far the
greatest,—so great that on this ground alone Ewald as early as the year
1831 (*Stud. u. Krit.*, p. 604) declared it impossible that the one
could have been written to supplement the other. Combining this
observation with the undisputed priority of the Jehovist over
Deuteronomy, it will follow that the Priestly Code stands last in the
series. But such a consideration, although, so far as I know, proceeding
upon admitted data, has no value as long as it confines itself to such
mere generalities. It is necessary to trace the succession of the three
elements in detail, and at once to test and to fix each by reference to
an independent standard, namely, the inner development of the history of
Israel so far as that is known to us by trustworthy testimonies, from
independent sources.

The literary and historical investigation on which we thus enter is

<span id="page_13">p. 13</span>

both wide and difficult. It falls into three parts. In the *first*,
which lays the foundations, the data relating to sacred archæology are
brought together and arranged in such a way as to show that in the
Pentateuch the elements follow upon one another and from one another
precisely as the steps of the development demonstrably do in the
history. Almost involuntarily this argument has taken the shape of a
sort of history of the ordinances of worship. Rude and colourless that
history must be confessed to be,—a fault due to the materials, which
hardly allow us to do more than mark the contrast between pre-exilic and
post-exilic, and, in a secondary measure, that between Deuteronomic and
pre-Deuteronomic. At the same time there is this advantage arising out
of the breadth of the periods treated: they cannot fail to distinguish
themselves from each other in a tangible manner; it must be possible in
the case of historical, and even of legal works, to recognise whether
they were written before or after the exile. The *second* part, in many
respects dependent on the first, traces the influence of the
successively prevailing ideas and tendencies upon the shaping of
historical tradition, and follows the various phases in which that was
conceived and set forth. It contains, so to speak, a history of
tradition. The *third* part sums up the critical results of the
preceding two, with some further determining considerations, and
concludes with a more general survey.

The assumptions I make will find an ever-recurring justification in the
course of the investigation; the two principal are, that the work of the
Jehovist, so far as the nucleus of it is concerned, belongs to the
course of the Assyrian period, and that Deuteronomy belongs to its
close. Moreover, however strongly I am convinced that the latter is to
be dated in accordance with 2 Kings xxii., I do not, like Graf, so use
this position as to make it the fulcrum for my lever. Deuteronomy is the
starting-point, not in the sense that without it it would be impossible
to accomplish anything, but only because, when its position has been
historically ascertained, we cannot decline to go on, but must demand
that the position of the Priestly Code should also be fixed by reference
to history. My inquiry proceeds on a broader basis than that of Graf,
and comes nearer to that of Vatke, from whom indeed I gratefully
acknowledge myself to have learnt best and most.

critical labours to his Strassburg master was not unknown; but how great
must have been the share of Reuss in the hypothesis of Graf has only
been revealed in 1879, by the publication of certain theses which he had
formulated as early as 1833, but had hesitated to lay in print before
the general theological public. These are as follows:—

"1. L’élément historique du Pentateuque peut et doit être examiné à part
et ne pas être confondu avec l’élément légal. 2. L’un et l’autre ont pu
exister sans rédaction écrite. La mention, chez d’anciens écrivains, de
certaines traditions patriarcales ou mosaiques, ne prouve pas
l’existence du Pentateuque, et une nation peut avoir un droit coutumier
sans code écrit. Les traditions nationales des Israélites remontent plus
haut que les lois du Pentateuque et la rédaction des premières est
antérieure à celle des secondes. 4. L’intérêt principal de l’historien
doit porter sur la date des lois, parce que sur ce terrain il a plus de
chance d’arriver à des résultats certains. Il faut en conséquence
procéder à l’interrogatoire des témoins. 5. L’histoire racontée, dans
les livres des Juges et de Samuel, et même en partie celle comprise dans
les livres des Rois, est en contradiction avec des lois dites mosaiques
; donc celles-ci étaientinconnues à l’époque de la rédaction de ces
livres, à plus forte raison elles n’ont pas existé dans les temps qui y
sont décrits. 6. Les prophètes du 8<sup>e</sup> et du 7<sup>e</sup>
siècle ne savent rien du code mosaique. 7. Jérémie est le premier
prophète qui connaisse une loi écrite et ses citations rapportent au
Deutéronome. 8. Le Deutéronome (iv. 45-xxviii. 68) est le livre que les
prêtres prétendaient avoir trouvé dans le temple du temps du roi Josias.
Ce code est la partie la plus ancienne de la législation (rédigée)
comprise dans le Pentateuque. 9. L’histoire dés Israélites, en tant
qu’il s’agit du développement national déterminé par des lois écrites,
se divisera en deux périodes, avant et après Josias. 10. Ezéchiel est
antérieur à la rédaction du code rituel et des lois qui ont
définitivement organisé la hiérarchie. 11. Le livre du Josué n’est pas,
tant s’en faut, la partie la plus récente de l’ouvrage entier. 12. Le
rédacteur du Pentateuque se distingue clairement de l’ancien prophète
Moyse."—*L’Histoire Sainte et la Loi*, Paris, 1879, pp. 23, 24.

details, but, as regards the way in which the literary process which
resulted in the formation of the Pentateuch is to be looked at in
general, I believe I had indicated the proper line of investigation.
Hitherto the only important corrections I have received have been those
of Kuenen in his *Contributions to the Criticism of the Pentateuch and
Joshua*, published in the *Leyden Theologisch Tijdschrift;* but these
are altogether welcome, inasmuch as they only free my own fundamental
view from some relics of the old leaven of a mechanical separation of
sources which had continued to adhere to it. For what Kuenen points out
is, that certain elements assigned by me to the Elohist are not
fragments of a once independent whole, but interpolated and parasitic
additions. What effect this demonstration may have on the judgment we
form of the Elohist himself is as yet uncertain. In the following pages
the Jehovistic history-book is denoted by the symbol JE, its Jehovistic
part by J, and the Elohistic by E; the "main stock" pure and simple,
which is distinguished by its systematising history and is seen
unalloyed in Genesis, is called the Book of the Four Covenants and is
symbolised by Q; for the "main stock" as a whole (as modified by an
editorial process) the title of Priestly Code and the symbol RQ (Q and
Revisers) are employed.

As early as 1866 he had already expressed himself in a letter to Kuenen
November 12) as follows:—"Vous me faites pressentir une solution de
cette énigme . . . c’est que les parties élohistiques de la Genèse
seraient postérieures aux parties jéhovistiques." Compare Kuenen,
*Theol. Tijdschrift* (1870), p. 412. Graf had also in this respect
followed Reuss, who (*ut supra*, p. 24) says of himself: "Le côté faible
de ma critique a été que, à l’égard de tout ce qui ne rentrait pas dans
les points énumérés ci-dessus, je restais dans l’ornière tracée par mes
devanciers, admettant sans plus ample examen que le Pentateuque était
l’ouvrage de *l’historien* élohiste, complété par *l’historien*
jéhoviste, et ne me rendant pas compte de la manière dont l’élément
légal, dont je m’étais occupé exclusivement, serait venu se joindre à
l’élément historique.
