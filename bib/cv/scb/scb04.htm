<p align="center">CHRIST IS EQUAL WITH GOD.</p>  
<p>I and my Father are <i>one</i>. (John 10:30.)</p>  
<p>Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be <i>equal with God</i>. (Phil. 2:5.)</p>  
<p align="center">CHRIST IS <b>NOT</b> EQUAL WITH GOD.</p>  
<p>My father is <i>greater</i> than I. (John 14:28.)</p>  
<p>Of that day and hour knoweth no man, not the angels of heaven, but my <i>Father only</i>. (Matt. 24:36.)</p>

<p><i>All power</i> is given unto me in heaven and in earth. (Matt. 28:18.)</p>  
<p>The Father loveth the Son and hath given <i>all things</i> into his hand. (John 3:35.)</p>  
<p align="center">JESUS WAS <b>NOT</b> ALL-POWERFUL.</p>

<p align="center"><A NAME="an_110">110</A>.</p>  
<p align="center">THE LAW WAS SUPERSEDED BY THE CHRISTIAN DISPENSATION.</p>  
<p>The law and the prophets were <i>until</i> John; since that time the <i>kingdom of God</i> is preached. (Luke 16:16.)</p>  
<p>Having <i>abolished</i> in the flesh the enmity, even the <i>law of commandments</i> contained in <i>ordinances</i>. (Eph. 2:15.)</p>  
<p>But now we are <i>delivered from the law</i>. (Rom. 7:6.)</p>  
<p align="center">THE LAW WAS <b>NOT</b> SUPERSEDED BY THE CHRISTIAN DISPENSATION.</p>  
<p>I am come <i>not to destroy the law</i> but to fulfill. For verily I say unto you, till heaven and earth pass, one <i>jot</i> or one <i>tittle</i> shall in <i>no wise pass from the law</i> till all be fulfilled. Whosoever therefore shall break one of the <i>least commandments</i> and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven. (Matt. 5:17, 18, 19.)</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p align="center"><A NAME="an_111">111</A>.</p>  
<p align="center">CHRIST'S MISSION WAS PEACE.</p>  
<p>And suddenly there was with the angels a multitude of the heavenly host praising God and saying, Glory to God in the highest, and <i>on earth</i> peace. (Luke 2:13, 14.)</p>  
<p align="center">CHRIST'S MISSION WAS <b>NOT</b> PEACE.</p>  
<p><i>Think not</i> that I am come to send <i>peace on earth;</i> I <i>came not to send peace</i>, but a sword. (Matt. 10:34.)</p>

<p align="center">CHRIST RECEIVED NOT TESTIMONY FROM MAN.</p>  
<p>Ye sent unto John and he bare witness unto the truth. But I receive not <i>testimony from man</i>. (John 5:33, 34.)</p>  
<p align="center">CHRIST <b>DID</b> RECEIVE TESTIMONY FROM MAN.</p>  
<p>And ye shall also <i>bear witness</i>, because ye have been <i>with me</i> from the beginning. (John 15:27.)</p>

<p align="center"><A NAME="an_113">113</A>.</p>  
<p align="center">CHRIST'S WITNESS OF HIMSELF IS TRUE.</p>  
<p>I am one that bear witness of myself. . . . Though I bear record of myself, yet <i>my record is true</i>. (John 8:18, 14.)</p>  
<p align="center">CHRIST'S WITNESS OF HIMSELF IS <b>NOT</b> TRUE.</p>  
<p>If I bear witness of myself, <i>my witness is not true</i>. (John 5:31.)</p>

<p align="center">CHRIST LAID DOWN HIS LIFE FOR HIS FRIENDS.</p>  
<p>Greater love hath no man than this, that a man <i>lay down his life for his friends</i>. (John 15:13.)</p>  
<p>The good <i>shepherd</i> giveth his life for the <i>sheep</i>. (John 10:11.)</p>  
<p align="center">CHRIST LAID DOWN HIS LIFE FOR HIS <b>ENEMIES</b>.</p>  
<p>When we were <i>enemies</i>, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son. (Rom. 5:10.)</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p align="center"><A NAME="an_115">115</A>.</p>  
<p align="center">IT WAS LAWFUL FOR THE JEWS TO PUT CHRIST TO DEATH.</p>  
<p>The Jews answered him, We have a <i>law</i>, and by our law he <i>ought to die</i>. (John 19:7.)</p>  
<p align="center">IT WAS <b>NOT</b> LAWFUL FOR THE JEWS TO PUT HIM TO DEATH.</p>  
<p>The Jews therefore said unto him, It is <i>not lawful</i> for us to put <i>any man to death</i>. (John 18:31.)</p>

<p align="center"><A NAME="an_116">116</A>.</p>  
<p align="center">CHILDREN ARE PUNISHED FOR THE SINS OF THEIR PARENTS.</p>  
<p>I am a jealous God, <i>visiting the iniquities of the fathers upon the children</i>. (Ex. 20:5.)</p>  
<p align="center">CHILDREN ARE <b>NOT</b> PUNISHED FOR THE SINS OF THEIR PARENTS.</p>  
<p>The <i>son</i> shall <i>not</i> bear the iniquities of the <i>father</i>. (Ezek. 18:20.)</p>

<p align="center">MAN IS JUSTIFIED BY FAITH ALONE.</p>  
<p>By the deeds of the <i>law</i> there shall <i>no flesh be justified</i>. (Rom. 3:20.)</p>  
<p>Knowing that a man is <i>not justified by the works of the law</i>, but by the faith of Jesus Christ. (Gal. 2:16.)</p>  
<p>The <i>just</i> shall live by faith. And the <i>law</i> is <i>not</i> of faith. (Gal. 3:11, 12.)</p>  
<p>For <i>if</i> Abraham were justified by works he hath whereof to glory. (Rom. 4:2.)</p>  
<p align="center">MAN IS <b>NOT</b> JUSTIFIED BY FAITH ALONE.</p>  
<p>Was not Abraham our father <i>justified by works?</i> . . . Ye see then how that <i>by works a man is justified, and not by faith only</i>. (James 2:21, 24.)</p>  
<p>The doers of the <i>law</i> shall be justified. (Rom. 2:13.)</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p align="center"><A NAME="an_118">118</A>.</p>  
<p align="center">IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO FALL FROM GRACE.</p>  
<p>And I give unto them eternal life, and they shall <i>never perish</i>, neither shall any pluck them out of my hand. (John 10:28.)</p>  
<p>Neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor height nor depth, nor any other creature, shall <i>be able to separate us</i> from the love of God which is in Christ our Lord. (Rom. 8:38, 39.)</p>  
<p align="center">IT <b>IS</b> POSSIBLE TO FALL FROM GRACE.</p>  
<p>But when the <i>righteous</i> man <i>turneth</i><i> away</i> from his righteousness, and <i>committeth</i><i> iniquity</i>, and doeth according to all the abominations that the wicked man doeth, shall he <i>live?</i> All his righteousness that he hath done shall not be mentioned; in his trespass that he hath trespassed, and in his sin that he hath sinned, in them shall he die. (Ezek. 18:24.)</p>  
<p>For it is possible for those who were <i>once enlightened</i>, and have <i>tasted</i> of the <i>heavenly gift</i>, and are made <i>partakers</i> of the <i>Holy Ghost</i>, and have tasted the good <i>word of God</i>, and the powers of the world to come, if they <i>shall fall away</i>, to <i>renew</i> them <i>again</i> unto repentance. (Heb. 6:4, 5, 6.)</p>  
<p>For if, after they have escaped the pollutions of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, they are <i>again entangled therein and overcome</i>, the latter end is worse than the beginning. For it had been better for them <i>not to have known</i> the way of righteousness, than after they had known it, to <i>turn from the holy commandment</i> delivered unto them. (2 Pet. 2:20, 21.)</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p align="center"><A NAME="an_119">119</A>.</p>  
<p align="center">NO MAN IS WITHOUT SIN.</p>  
<p>For there is <i>no</i> man that <i>sinneth</i><i> not</i>. (1 Kings 8:46.)</p>  
<p>Who can say, I have made my heart <i>clean;</i> I am <i>pure</i> from my <i>sin?</i> (Prov. 20:9.)</p>  
<p>For there is <i>not a just man</i> upon earth, that doeth good and sinneth not. (Eccl. 7:20.)</p>  
<p>There is <i>none</i> righteous, no, not one. (Rom. 3:10.)</p>  
<p align="center">CHRISTIANS ARE <b>SINLESS</b>.</p>  
<p>Whosoever is born of God <i>doth not commit sin;</i> . . . he <i>cannot sin</i>, because he is born of God. . . . Whosoever abideth in him <i>sinneth</i><i> not</i>. He that committeth sin is of the devil. (1 John 3:9, 6, 8.)</p>

<p align="center">THERE IS TO BE A RESURRECTION OF THE DEAD.</p>  
<p>The trumpet shall sound and the <i>dead</i> shall be <i>raised</i>. (1 Cor. 15:52.)</p>  
<p>And I saw the <i>dead</i>, small and great, stand before God; . . . and they were judged, every man according to their works. (Rev. 20:12, 13.)</p>  
<p>Now that the <i>dead are raised</i> even Moses showed at the bush, when he called the Lord the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. (Luke 20:37.)</p>  
<p>For if the dead <i>rise</i> not, then is not Christ raised. (1 Cor. 15:16.)</p>  
<p align="center">THERE IS TO BE <b>NO</b> RESURRECTION OF THE DEAD.</p>  
<p>As the cloud is consumed and vanisheth away, so he that goeth down to the grave shall <i>come up no more</i>. (Job 7:9.)</p>  
<p>The dead <i>know not anything</i>, neither have they any more a reward. (Eccl. 9:5.)</p>  
<p>They are dead, they <i>shall not live;</i> they are deceased they <i>shall not rise</i>. (Is. 26:14.)</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p align="center"><A NAME="an_121">121</A>.</p>  
<p align="center">REWARD AND PUNISHMENT TO BE BESTOWED IN THIS WORLD.</p>  
<p>Behold the righteous shall be <i>recompensed</i> in the earth, much more the <i>wicked</i> and the <i>sinner</i>. (Prov. 11:31.)</p>  
<p align="center">REWARD AND PUNISHMENT TO BE BESTOWED IN THE <b>NEXT</b> WORLD.</p>  
<p>And the <i>dead were judged</i> out of those things which were written in the books, <i>according</i> to their <i>works</i>. (Rev. 20:12.)</p>  
<p><i>Then</i> he shall <i>reward</i> every man according to his works. (Matt. 16:27.)</p>  
<p><i>According</i> to that he hath <i>done</i>, whether it be <i>good</i> or <i>bad</i>. (2 Cor. 5:10.)</p>  
<p align="center"><A NAME="an_122">122</A>.</p>  
<p align="center">ANNIHILATION THE PORTION OF ALL MANKIND.</p>  
<p>Why died I not from the womb? Why did I not give up the ghost when I came out of the belly? . . . For now should I have <i>lain still</i> and <i>been quiet;</i> I should have <i>slept;</i> then had I been at <i>rest</i>, with kings and counsellors of the earth, which built desolate places for themselves; or with princes that had gold, who filled their houses with silver; or as a <i>hidden, untimely birth</i> I had not been; as <i>infants</i> which <i>never saw light</i>. THERE the wicked <i>cease from troubling</i>, and there the weary be <i>at rest</i>. . . . The small and great are there, and the servant is free from his master. Wherefore is light given to him that is in misery, and <i>life</i> unto the bitter in soul, which long for <i>death</i> and it cometh not, . . . which rejoice exceedingly when they have found the <i>grave?</i> (Job 3:11, 13-17, 19, 20, 21, 22.)</p>  
<p><i>The dead know not anything</i>. . . . For there is no work, nor device, nor <i>knowledge</i>, nor <i>wisdom</i> in the grave whither thou goest. (Eccl. 9:5, 10.)</p>  
<p>For that which befalleth the sons of <i>men</i> befalleth the <i>beasts</i>, even <i>one thing</i> befalleth them; as the <i>one</i> dieth, so dieth the <i>other;</i> yea, they have <i>all one breath;</i> so that a man hath no preeminence above a beast. . . . All go unto <i>one place</i>. (Eccl. 3:19, 20.)</p>  
<p align="center"><b>ENDLESS MISERY</b> THE PORTION OF A <b>PART</b> OF MANKIND.</p>  
<p>These shall go away unto <i>everlasting punishment</i>. (Matt. 25:46.)</p>  
<p>And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are, and shall be <i>tormented day and night for ever and ever</i>. . . . And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire. (Rev. 20:10, 15.)</p>  
<p>And the smoke of their <i>torment</i> ascendeth up <i>forever</i> and ever. (Rev. 14:11.)</p>  
<p>And many of them that sleep in the dust shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame and <i>everlasting contempt</i>. (Dan. 12:2.)</p>

<p><i>They shall perish</i>, but thou remainest. (Heb. 1:11.)</p>  
<p>And I saw a great white throne, and him that sat on it, from whose face the <i>earth</i> and the heaven <i>fled away</i>, and there was <i>no place</i> found for them. (Rev. 20:11.)</p>  
<p align="center">THE EARTH IS <b>NEVER</b> TO BE DESTROYED.</p>  
<p>Who laid the foundations of the <i>earth</i> that it <i>should not be removed forever</i>. (Ps. 104:5.)</p>  
<p>But the <i>earth abideth forever</i>. (Eccl. 1:4.)</p>

<p align="center">NO EVIL SHALL HAPPEN TO THE GODLY.</p>  
<p>There shall no evil happen to the just. (Prov. 12:21.) Who is he that will harm you, if ye be followers of that which is good? (1 Pet. 3:13.)</p>  
<p align="center">EVIL <b>DOES</b> HAPPEN TO THE GODLY.</p>  
<p>Whom the Lord loveth he <i>chasteneth</i>, and <i>scourgeth</i> every <i>son</i> whom he receiveth. (Heb. 12:6.)</p>  
<p>And the Lord said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is none like him, a <i>perfect</i> and an <i>upright</i> man? . . . So went Satan forth . . . and <i>smote</i> Job with <i>sore boils</i> from the sole of his foot unto the crown of his head. (Job 2:3, 7.)</p>

<p align="center"><A NAME="an_125">125</A>.</p>  
<p align="center">WORLDLY GOOD AND PROSPERITY ARE THE LOT OF THE GODLY.</p>  
<p>There shall <i>no evil</i> happen to the <i>just</i>. (Prov. 12:21.)</p>  
<p>For the Lord loveth judgment and forsaketh not his <i>saints;</i> they are <i>preserved forever</i>. . . . The wicked watcheth for the righteous and seeketh to slay him. The Lord <i>will not leave him</i> in his hand, nor condemn him when he is judged. . . . Mark the perfect man, and behold the upright; for the <i>end</i> of that man is peace. (Ps. 37:28, 32, 33, 37.)</p>  
<p>Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly. . . . <i>Whatsoever he doeth shall prosper</i>. (Ps. 1:1, 3.)</p>  
<p>And the Lord was with <i>Joseph</i>, and he was a <i>prosperous</i> man. (Gen. 39:2.)</p>

<p align="center">WORLDLY <b>MISERY AND DESTITUTION</b> THE LOT OF THE GODLY.</p>  
<p>They were <i>stoned</i>, they were <i>sawn asunder</i>, were <i>tempted</i>, were <i>slain</i> with the <i>sword;</i> they wandered about in sheepskins and goat-skins; being <i>destitute</i>, <i>afflicted</i>, <i>tormented;</i> . . . they wandered in <i>deserts</i>, and in <i>mountains</i>, and in <i>dens</i> and <i>caves</i> of the earth. (Heb. 11:37, 38.)</p>  
<p>These are they which came out of <i>great tribulation</i>. (Rev. 7:14.)</p>  
<p>Yea, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall <i>suffer persecution</i>. (2 Tim. 3:12.)</p>

(Mark 10:29, 30.)</p>  
<p>I have been young, and now am old; yet have I <i>not seen the righteous forsaken nor his seed begging bread</i>. (Ps. 37:25.)</p>  
<p>Blessed is the man that feareth the Lord. . . . <i>Wealth</i> and <i>riches</i> shall be in his <i>house</i>. (Ps. 112:1, 3.)</p>  
<p>If thou return unto the Almighty, thou shalt be built up. . . . Then shalt thou <i>lay up gold as dust</i>. (Job. 22:23, 24.)</p>
