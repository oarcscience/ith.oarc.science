# SPECULATIVE DOCTRINES

<span id="an_108">108</span>.

CHRIST IS EQUAL WITH GOD.

I and my Father are *one*. (John 10:30.)

Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be *equal with
God*. (Phil. 2:5.)

CHRIST IS **NOT** EQUAL WITH GOD.

My father is *greater* than I. (John 14:28.)

Of that day and hour knoweth no man, not the angels of heaven, but my
*Father only*. (Matt. 24:36.)

 

<span id="an_109">109</span>.

JESUS WAS ALL-POWERFUL

*All power* is given unto me in heaven and in earth. (Matt. 28:18.)

The Father loveth the Son and hath given *all things* into his hand.
(John 3:35.)

JESUS WAS **NOT** ALL-POWERFUL.

And *he could there do no mighty work*, save that he laid his hands on a
few sick folk and healed them. (Mark 6:5.)

 

<span id="an_110">110</span>.

THE LAW WAS SUPERSEDED BY THE CHRISTIAN DISPENSATION.

The law and the prophets were *until* John; since that time the *kingdom
of God* is preached. (Luke 16:16.)

Having *abolished* in the flesh the enmity, even the *law of
commandments* contained in *ordinances*. (Eph. 2:15.)

But now we are *delivered from the law*. (Rom. 7:6.)

THE LAW WAS **NOT** SUPERSEDED BY THE CHRISTIAN DISPENSATION.

I am come *not to destroy the law* but to fulfill. For verily I say unto
you, till heaven and earth pass, one *jot* or one *tittle* shall in *no
wise pass from the law* till all be fulfilled. Whosoever therefore shall
break one of the *least commandments* and shall teach men so, he shall
be called the least in the kingdom of heaven. (Matt. 5:17, 18, 19.)

 

<span id="an_111">111</span>.

CHRIST'S MISSION WAS PEACE.

And suddenly there was with the angels a multitude of the heavenly host
praising God and saying, Glory to God in the highest, and *on earth*
peace. (Luke 2:13, 14.)

CHRIST'S MISSION WAS **NOT** PEACE.

*Think not* that I am come to send *peace on earth;* I *came not to send
peace*, but a sword. (Matt. 10:34.)

 

<span id="an_112">112</span>.

CHRIST RECEIVED NOT TESTIMONY FROM MAN.

Ye sent unto John and he bare witness unto the truth. But I receive not
*testimony from man*. (John 5:33, 34.)

CHRIST **DID** RECEIVE TESTIMONY FROM MAN.

And ye shall also *bear witness*, because ye have been *with me* from
the beginning. (John 15:27.)

 

<span id="an_113">113</span>.

CHRIST'S WITNESS OF HIMSELF IS TRUE.

I am one that bear witness of myself. . . . Though I bear record of
myself, yet *my record is true*. (John 8:18, 14.)

CHRIST'S WITNESS OF HIMSELF IS **NOT** TRUE.

If I bear witness of myself, *my witness is not true*. (John 5:31.)

 

<span id="an_114">114</span>.

CHRIST LAID DOWN HIS LIFE FOR HIS FRIENDS.

Greater love hath no man than this, that a man *lay down his life for
his friends*. (John 15:13.)

The good *shepherd* giveth his life for the *sheep*. (John 10:11.)

CHRIST LAID DOWN HIS LIFE FOR HIS **ENEMIES**.

When we were *enemies*, we were reconciled to God by the death of his
Son. (Rom. 5:10.)

 

<span id="an_115">115</span>.

IT WAS LAWFUL FOR THE JEWS TO PUT CHRIST TO DEATH.

The Jews answered him, We have a *law*, and by our law he *ought to
die*. (John 19:7.)

IT WAS **NOT** LAWFUL FOR THE JEWS TO PUT HIM TO DEATH.

The Jews therefore said unto him, It is *not lawful* for us to put *any
man to death*. (John 18:31.)

 

<span id="an_116">116</span>.

CHILDREN ARE PUNISHED FOR THE SINS OF THEIR PARENTS.

I am a jealous God, *visiting the iniquities of the fathers upon the
children*. (Ex. 20:5.)

CHILDREN ARE **NOT** PUNISHED FOR THE SINS OF THEIR PARENTS.

The *son* shall *not* bear the iniquities of the *father*. (Ezek.
18:20.)

 

<span id="an_117">117</span>.

MAN IS JUSTIFIED BY FAITH ALONE.

By the deeds of the *law* there shall *no flesh be justified*. (Rom.
3:20.)

Knowing that a man is *not justified by the works of the law*, but by
the faith of Jesus Christ. (Gal. 2:16.)

The *just* shall live by faith. And the *law* is *not* of faith. (Gal.
3:11, 12.)

For *if* Abraham were justified by works he hath whereof to glory. (Rom.
4:2.)

MAN IS **NOT** JUSTIFIED BY FAITH ALONE.

Was not Abraham our father *justified by works?* . . . Ye see then how
that *by works a man is justified, and not by faith only*. (James 2:21,
24.)

The doers of the *law* shall be justified. (Rom. 2:13.)

 

<span id="an_118">118</span>.

IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO FALL FROM GRACE.

And I give unto them eternal life, and they shall *never perish*,
neither shall any pluck them out of my hand. (John 10:28.)

Neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor
things present, nor things to come, nor height nor depth, nor any other
creature, shall *be able to separate us* from the love of God which is
in Christ our Lord. (Rom. 8:38, 39.)

IT **IS** POSSIBLE TO FALL FROM GRACE.

But when the *righteous* man *turneth* *away* from his righteousness,
and *committeth* *iniquity*, and doeth according to all the abominations
that the wicked man doeth, shall he *live?* All his righteousness that
he hath done shall not be mentioned; in his trespass that he hath
trespassed, and in his sin that he hath sinned, in them shall he die.
(Ezek. 18:24.)

For it is possible for those who were *once enlightened*, and have
*tasted* of the *heavenly gift*, and are made *partakers* of the *Holy
Ghost*, and have tasted the good *word of God*, and the powers of the
world to come, if they *shall fall away*, to *renew* them *again* unto
repentance. (Heb. 6:4, 5, 6.)

For if, after they have escaped the pollutions of the world through the
knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, they are *again
entangled therein and overcome*, the latter end is worse than the
beginning. For it had been better for them *not to have known* the way
of righteousness, than after they had known it, to *turn from the holy
commandment* delivered unto them. (2 Pet. 2:20, 21.)

 

<span id="an_119">119</span>.

NO MAN IS WITHOUT SIN.

For there is *no* man that *sinneth* *not*. (1 Kings 8:46.)

Who can say, I have made my heart *clean;* I am *pure* from my *sin?*
(Prov. 20:9.)

For there is *not a just man* upon earth, that doeth good and sinneth
not. (Eccl. 7:20.)

There is *none* righteous, no, not one. (Rom. 3:10.)

CHRISTIANS ARE **SINLESS**.

Whosoever is born of God *doth not commit sin;* . . . he *cannot sin*,
because he is born of God. . . . Whosoever abideth in him *sinneth*
*not*. He that committeth sin is of the devil. (1 John 3:9, 6, 8.)

 

<span id="an_120">120</span>.

THERE IS TO BE A RESURRECTION OF THE DEAD.

The trumpet shall sound and the *dead* shall be *raised*. (1 Cor.
15:52.)

And I saw the *dead*, small and great, stand before God; . . . and they
were judged, every man according to their works. (Rev. 20:12, 13.)

Now that the *dead are raised* even Moses showed at the bush, when he
called the Lord the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of
Jacob. (Luke 20:37.)

For if the dead *rise* not, then is not Christ raised. (1 Cor. 15:16.)

THERE IS TO BE **NO** RESURRECTION OF THE DEAD.

As the cloud is consumed and vanisheth away, so he that goeth down to
the grave shall *come up no more*. (Job 7:9.)

The dead *know not anything*, neither have they any more a reward.
(Eccl. 9:5.)

They are dead, they *shall not live;* they are deceased they *shall not
rise*. (Is. 26:14.)

 

<span id="an_121">121</span>.

REWARD AND PUNISHMENT TO BE BESTOWED IN THIS WORLD.

Behold the righteous shall be *recompensed* in the earth, much more the
*wicked* and the *sinner*. (Prov. 11:31.)

REWARD AND PUNISHMENT TO BE BESTOWED IN THE **NEXT** WORLD.

And the *dead were judged* out of those things which were written in the
books, *according* to their *works*. (Rev. 20:12.)

*Then* he shall *reward* every man according to his works. (Matt.
16:27.)

*According* to that he hath *done*, whether it be *good* or *bad*. (2
Cor. 5:10.)

<span id="an_122">122</span>.

ANNIHILATION THE PORTION OF ALL MANKIND.

Why died I not from the womb? Why did I not give up the ghost when I
came out of the belly? . . . For now should I have *lain still* and
*been quiet;* I should have *slept;* then had I been at *rest*, with
kings and counsellors of the earth, which built desolate places for
themselves; or with princes that had gold, who filled their houses with
silver; or as a *hidden, untimely birth* I had not been; as *infants*
which *never saw light*. THERE the wicked *cease from troubling*, and
there the weary be *at rest*. . . . The small and great are there, and
the servant is free from his master. Wherefore is light given to him
that is in misery, and *life* unto the bitter in soul, which long for
*death* and it cometh not, . . . which rejoice exceedingly when they
have found the *grave?* (Job 3:11, 13-17, 19, 20, 21, 22.)

*The dead know not anything*. . . . For there is no work, nor device,
nor *knowledge*, nor *wisdom* in the grave whither thou goest. (Eccl.
9:5, 10.)

For that which befalleth the sons of *men* befalleth the *beasts*, even
*one thing* befalleth them; as the *one* dieth, so dieth the *other;*
yea, they have *all one breath;* so that a man hath no preeminence above
a beast. . . . All go unto *one place*. (Eccl. 3:19, 20.)

**ENDLESS MISERY** THE PORTION OF A **PART** OF MANKIND.

These shall go away unto *everlasting punishment*. (Matt. 25:46.)

And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and
brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are, and shall be
*tormented day and night for ever and ever*. . . . And whosoever was not
found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire. (Rev.
20:10, 15.)

And the smoke of their *torment* ascendeth up *forever* and ever. (Rev.
14:11.)

And many of them that sleep in the dust shall awake, some to everlasting
life, and some to shame and *everlasting contempt*. (Dan. 12:2.)

 

<span id="an_123">123</span>.

THE EARTH IS TO BE DESTROYED.

The earth also and the works that are therein shall be *burned up*. (2
Pet. 3:10.)

*They shall perish*, but thou remainest. (Heb. 1:11.)

And I saw a great white throne, and him that sat on it, from whose face
the *earth* and the heaven *fled away*, and there was *no place* found
for them. (Rev. 20:11.)

THE EARTH IS **NEVER** TO BE DESTROYED.

Who laid the foundations of the *earth* that it *should not be removed
forever*. (Ps. 104:5.)

But the *earth abideth forever*. (Eccl. 1:4.)

 

<span id="an_124">124</span>.

NO EVIL SHALL HAPPEN TO THE GODLY.

There shall no evil happen to the just. (Prov. 12:21.) Who is he that
will harm you, if ye be followers of that which is good? (1 Pet. 3:13.)

EVIL **DOES** HAPPEN TO THE GODLY.

Whom the Lord loveth he *chasteneth*, and *scourgeth* every *son* whom
he receiveth. (Heb. 12:6.)

And the Lord said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that
there is none like him, a *perfect* and an *upright* man? . . . So went
Satan forth . . . and *smote* Job with *sore boils* from the sole of his
foot unto the crown of his head. (Job 2:3, 7.)

 

<span id="an_125">125</span>.

WORLDLY GOOD AND PROSPERITY ARE THE LOT OF THE GODLY.

There shall *no evil* happen to the *just*. (Prov. 12:21.)

For the Lord loveth judgment and forsaketh not his *saints;* they are
*preserved forever*. . . . The wicked watcheth for the righteous and
seeketh to slay him. The Lord *will not leave him* in his hand, nor
condemn him when he is judged. . . . Mark the perfect man, and behold
the upright; for the *end* of that man is peace. (Ps. 37:28, 32, 33,
37.)

Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly. . . .
*Whatsoever he doeth shall prosper*. (Ps. 1:1, 3.)

And the Lord was with *Joseph*, and he was a *prosperous* man. (Gen.
39:2.)

So the Lord *blessed the latter end of Job* more than the beginning.
(Job. 42:12.)

WORLDLY **MISERY AND DESTITUTION** THE LOT OF THE GODLY.

They were *stoned*, they were *sawn asunder*, were *tempted*, were
*slain* with the *sword;* they wandered about in sheepskins and
goat-skins; being *destitute*, *afflicted*, *tormented;* . . . they
wandered in *deserts*, and in *mountains*, and in *dens* and *caves* of
the earth. (Heb. 11:37, 38.)

These are they which came out of *great tribulation*. (Rev. 7:14.)

Yea, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall *suffer
persecution*. (2 Tim. 3:12.)

And ye shall be *hated of all men* for my name's sake. (Luke 21:17.)

 

<span id="an_126">126</span>.

WORLDLY PROSPERITY A REWARD OF RIGHTEOUSNESS AND A BLESSING.

There is no man that hath left house, or brethren, or sisters, or
father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my sake and the
gospel's, but he shall receive a *hundred fold now in this time,
houses*, and brethren, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and
*lands*. (Mark 10:29, 30.)

I have been young, and now am old; yet have I *not seen the righteous
forsaken nor his seed begging bread*. (Ps. 37:25.)

Blessed is the man that feareth the Lord. . . . *Wealth* and *riches*
shall be in his *house*. (Ps. 112:1, 3.)

If thou return unto the Almighty, thou shalt be built up. . . . Then
shalt thou *lay up gold as dust*. (Job. 22:23, 24.)

In the house of the righteous is *much treasure*. (Prov. 15:6.)

WORLDLY PROSPERITY A **CURSE** AND A **BAR TO FUTURE REWARD**.

Blessed be ye *poor*. (Luke 6:20.)

*Lay not up* for yourselves treasures upon earth. . . . For where your
treasure is there will your heart be also. (Matt. 6:19, 21.)

And it came to pass that the *beggar died*, and was carried by the
angels into *Abraham's bosom*. (Luke 16:22.)

It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a
*rich* man to *enter into the kingdom of God*. (Matt. 19:24.)

*Woe* unto you that are *rich!* for ye have received your consolation.
(Luke 6:24.)

 

<span id="an_127">127</span>.

THE CHRISTIAN YOKE IS EASY.

Come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden and I will give you
*rest*. Take my yoke upon you. . . . For *my yoke is easy and my burden
is light*. (Matt. 11:28, 29, 30.)

THE CHRISTIAN YOKE IS **NOT** EASY.

In the world ye *shall have tribulation*. (John 16:33.)

Yea, and ALL that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer
*persecution*. (2 Tim. 3:12.)

Whom the Lord loveth he *chasteneth*, and *scourgeth* every son whom he
receiveth . . . . For if ye be *without* chastisement then are ye
*bastards* and not sons. (Heb. 12:6, 8.)

 

<span id="an_128">128</span>.

THE FRUIT OF GOD'S SPIRIT IS LOVE AND GENTLENESS.

The fruit of the spirit is *love*, *peace*, *joy*, *gentleness*, and
*goodness*. (Gal. 5:22.)

THE FRUIT OF GOD'S SPIRIT IS **VENGEANCE** AND **FURY**.

And the spirit of the Lord came upon him and he *slew a thousand men*.
(Judg. 15:14.)

And it came to pass on the morrow that the evil spirit *from God* came
upon Saul. . . and there was a javelin in Saul's hand. And Saul *cast
the javelin;* for he said, I will *smite David* even to the wall with
it. (1 Sam. 18:10, 11.)

 

<span id="an_129">129</span>.

LONGEVITY ENJOYED BY THE WICKED.

Wherefore do the wicked live, *become old*, yea, are mighty in power?
Their *seed* is established *in their sight with them, and their
offspring before their eyes*. (Job 21:7, 8.)

They \[men of the world\] are *full of children* and leave the rest of
their substance to their babes. (Ps. 17:14.)

Though a sinner do evil a hundred times and his *days be prolonged*, yet
surely I know that it shall be well with them that fear God. (Eccl.
8:12.)

But the sinner being *a hundred years old* shall be accursed. (Is.
65:20.)

LONGEVITY **DENIED** TO THE WICKED.

But it shall not be well with the wicked, *neither shall he prolong his
days*. (Eccl. 8:13.)

Bloody and deceitful men *shall not live out half their days*. (Ps.
55:23.)

The *years* of the wicked shall be *shortened*. (Prov. 10:27.)

They \[the hypocrites\] *die in youth*. (Job 36:14.)

Be not over much wicked, neither be foolish; why shouldst thou *die
before thy time?* (Eccl. 7:17.)

 

<span id="an_130">130</span>.

POVERTY IS A BLESSING.

*Blessed be ye poor*. . . . Woe unto you that are *rich!* (Luke 6:20,
24.)

Hath not God chosen the *poor* of this world, rich in faith, and *heirs
of the kingdom?* (James 2:5.)

**RICHES** A BLESSING.

The rich man's *wealth* is his *strong tower*, but the destruction of
the poor is their poverty. (Prov. 10:15.)

If thou return unto the Almighty then thou shall be *built up*. . . .
Thou shalt then *lay up gold* as dust. (Job 22:23, 24.)

And the Lord blessed the latter end of Job more than the beginning, for
he had 14,000 sheep, and 6,000 camels, and a *thousand* yoke of oxen,
and a *thousand* she asses. (Job 42:12.)

**NEITHER** POVERTY **NOR** RICHES A BLESSING.

Give me *neither poverty nor riches;* feed me with food convenient for
me; lest I be full, and deny thee and say, Who is the Lord? or lest I be
*poor and steal*, and take the name of my God in vain. (Prov. 30:8, 9.)

 

<span id="an_131">131</span>.

WISDOM A SOURCE OF ENJOYMENT.

*Happy* is the man that findeth *wisdom*. . . . Wisdom's ways are ways
of *pleasantness and all her paths are peace*. (Prov. 3:13, 17.)

WISDOM A SOURCE OF **VEXATION,** **GRIEF,** AND **SORROW**.

And I gave my heart to know wisdom. . . . I perceived that this also was
*vexation* of spirit. For in much wisdom is *much grief*, and he that
increaseth knowledge, increaseth *sorrow*. (Eccl. 1:17, 18.)

 

<span id="an_132">132</span>.

A GOOD NAME A BLESSING.

A good name is *better than precious ointment*. (Eccl. 7:1.)

A good name is rather to be chosen than *great riches*. (Prov. 22:1.)

A GOOD NAME IS A **CURSE**.

*Woe* unto you when all men shall *speak well* of you. (Luke 6:26.)

 

<span id="an_133">133</span>.

LAUGHTER COMMENDED.

To everything there is a season, and a time. . . . A time to weep, and a
time to *laugh*. (Eccl. 3:1, 4.)

Then I *commended mirth*, because a man hath *no better thing* under the
sun than to eat, and to drink, and to be *merry*. (Eccl. 8:15.)

LAUGHTER **CONDEMNED**.

*Woe* unto you that laugh now. (Luke 6:25.)

*Sorrow is better than laughter;* for by the sadness of the countenance
the heart is made better. The heart of the *wise* is in the house of
*mourning;* but the heart of the *fool* is in the house of *mirth*.
(Eccl. 7:3, 4.)

 

<span id="an_134">134</span>.

THE ROD OF CORRECTION A REMEDY FOR FOOLISHNESS.

Foolishness is bound in the heart of a child, but the rod of correction
will *drive it far from him*. (Prov. 22:15.)

THERE IS **NO** REMEDY FOR FOOLISHNESS.

Though thou shouldest *bray a fool in a mortar*, . . . yet will not his
foolishness depart from him. (Prov. 27:22.)

My brethren, I count it all *joy* when ye fall into *temptation*. (James
1:2.)

TEMPTATION **NOT** TO BE DESIRED.

Lead us *not* into temptation. (Matt. 6:13.)

 

<span id="an_137">137</span>.

PROPHECY IS SURE.

We have also a more *sure word of prophecy*, whereunto we do well that
we take heed, as unto a *light* that shineth in a dark place. (2 Pet.
1:19.)

PROPHECY IS **NOT** SURE.

At what instant I shall *speak* concerning a nation, and concerning a
kingdom, to pluck up, and to pull down, and to destroy it; if that
nation against whom I have pronounced turn from their evil, I will
*repent* of the evil that I thought to do unto them. And at what instant
I shall speak concerning a nation and concerning a kingdom, to build and
to plant it; if it do evil in my sight, that it obey not my voice, then
I will *repent* of the good wherewith I *said I would* benefit them.
(Jer. 18:7-10.)

 

<span id="an_138">138</span>.

MAN'S LIFE WAS TO BE ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY YEARS.

His days shall be a hundred and twenty years. (Gen. 6:3.)

<span id="an_139">139</span>.

THE FEAR OF MAN WAS TO BE UPON EVERY BEAST.

The *fear* of you and the *dread* of you shall be on *every* beast of
the earth. (Gen. 9:2.)

THE FEAR OF MAN IS **NOT** UPON THE LION.

A *lion* turneth not away for any. (Prov. 30:30.)

 

<span id="an_140">140</span>.

MIRACLES A PROOF OF DIVINE MISSION.

Now when John had heard in the prison the works of Christ, he sent two
of his disciples, and said unto him, Art thou he that should come, or do
we look for another? Jesus answered and said unto them, Go and show John
again those things which ye do hear and see; the *blind* receive their
*sight*, and the *lame walk*, the *lepers* are *cleansed*, and the *deaf
hear*, the *dead are raised*. (Matt. 11:2-5.)

Rabbi, we know that thou art a teacher come from God; for *no man can do
these miracles* that thou doest *except God be with him*. (John 3:2.)

And Israel saw that *great work* which the Lord done upon the Egyptians;
and the people feared the Lord and believed the Lord and *his servant
Moses*. (Ex. 14:31.)

 

<span id="an_141">141</span>.

MIRACLES **NOT** A PROOF OF DIVINE MISSION.

And Aaron cast down his rod before Pharaoh, and before his servants, and
it became a serpent. Then Pharaoh also called the wise men and the
sorcerers; now the magicians of Egypt, *they also did in like manner*
with their enchantments, for they cast down every man his rod, and *they
became serpents*. (Ex. 7:10-12.)

If there arise among you a prophet, or a dreamer of dreams, and giveth
thee a *sign* or a *wonder*, and the sign or the wonder *come to pass*
wherein he spake unto thee, saying, Let us go after other gods which
thou hast not known, and let us serve them, thou *shalt* *not hearken*
unto the words of that *prophet* or that dreamer of dreams. (Deut.
13:1-3.)

If I by Beelzebub *cast out devils*, by whom do your sons cast them out?
(Luke 11:19.)

 

<span id="an_142">142</span>.

MOSES WAS A VERY MEEK MAN.

Now, the man Moses, was *very meek*, above all the men that were upon
the face of the earth. (Num. 12:3.)

MOSES WAS A VERY **CRUEL** MAN.

And Moses said unto them, Have ye saved all the women alive? . . . Now,
therefore, *kill every male* among the *little ones*, and *kill every
woman* that hath known a man. (Num. 31:15, 17.)

 

<span id="an_143">143</span>.

ELIJAH WENT UP TO HEAVEN.

And Elijah *went up* by a whirlwind into *heaven*. (2 Kings 2:11.)

**NONE BUT CHRIST** EVER ASCENDED INTO HEAVEN.

*No man hath ascended* up to heaven but he that came down from heaven,
even the Son of Man. (John 3:13.)

 

<span id="an_144">144</span>.

ALL SCRIPTURE IS INSPIRED.

*All scripture* is given by *inspiration* of God. (2 Tim. 3:16.)
