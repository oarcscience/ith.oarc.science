Published anonymously by Burr in pamphlet form, Self-Contradictions of
the Bible was, and remains an essential reference work for Atheists,
Biblical skeptics and doubters, as well as believers who want to know
what the opposition is up to. It is a set of 144 thematically organized
pairs of Bible quotations that for the most part, will immediately
induce *cognitive dissonance* in some. You have been warned.

Burr was not an academic: he was a newspaper reporter, an Atheist
obviously, a supporter of Darwinism, but an amateur Bible scholar, and
sometimes that shows in the selections. Not everything here is, frankly,
a direct hit, and the relentless out-of-context quotes mirror how the
text can be abused by its adherents. However, this is a working-class
Atheist tract. It is not concerned with philosophical niceities. Rather,
it is a playbook for use in actual battle.

This is another one of those books which you'll either love or hate. Or
perhaps you'll like *half* of it. It is strange that even in the midst
of this critical broadside against the Bible, it is possible to enjoy
the poetry and archaic wisdom of this text, and perhaps some of the
mystery as well.
