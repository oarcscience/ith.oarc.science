### CHAPTER X.

#### THE SAVIORS OF ROYAL DESCENT, BUT HUMBLE BIRTH.

WE have the singular coincidence presented in the histories of several
of the Saviors of their lineal descent through a line of kings or
princes, and yet commencing their probationary life under the most
humble and adverse circumstances—being born in stables, caves, and other
inauspicious situations.

The story of their royal blood was calculated to add dignity to their
characters, while their humble birth in the midst of poverty, and
unmarked by ostentation, would evince their humility, meekness,
condescension, and absence of pride, and thus proclaim a lesson of
humility and resignation to their disciples and followers.

Here, seems to be plainly indicated the motives for assigning them to
such a birth, and such a character.

Christ's lineal descent, it will be remembered, is professedly traced
(though in a very zig-zag, disjointed manner) from the royal house of
David. And yet his royal blood did not save him from the most ignoble
and ignominious birth, and obscure exordium of his earth life.

A singular story, and yet a similar story, is told of the Indian Savior
Chrishna, who was, according to the Rev. Mr. Allen (India, p. 379) of
the royal house of Kousa, traced back through many generations. Yet, in
order to teach the world a lesson of true humility, and administer a

<span id="page_78">p. 78</span>

just reprehension to pride, he submitted to be born in a cave, amid the
denizens of subterranean abodes. And here let it be noted, the best and
most orthodox writers concede that while Christ is said to have born in
a manger, that manger was in a cave. Mr. Fleetwood (a very popular
Christian writer) testifies in this matter that "the Greek fathers
generally agree that the place of Christ's birth was a cave. (Life of
Christ, p. 568.) Then the coincidence in this respect between Christ and
Chrishna may be set down as complete.

We have no means of learning how many of the Saviors were of royal
blood, as the genealogy of some of them is not given. But those whose
lineal descent is furnished us are almost uniformly traced to or evinced
as springing from royal parentage, and practical liumility—so far as it
can be taught by an unostentatious birth—is a lesson taught by nearly
all. Buddha Sakia of Hindostan is directly traced through a royal
pedigree.

Speaking on this point, one writer remarks: "Tradition affirms that his
mother was betrothed to a rajah, and of course her son belonged to the
same royal caste that Chrishna did during his existence on earth."
(Prog. Rel. Ideas, vol, i. 84.)

"The Great Prophet" of Arabia (Mahomet) not only commenced his earthly
career in a humble situation, but resembled Christ in having "nowhere to
lay his head." It is said of the Great Prophet, "A cloak spread on the
ground served him for a bed, and a skin filled with date leaves was his
pillow." The genealogy of the God Yu (of China) is traced through a line
of princes to a very remote origin, while his whole life was a lesson of
practical humility, and proclaimed at every step, This is the way; walk
ye in it."
