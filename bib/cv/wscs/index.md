This is one of the most controversial books about the Christian
narrative of Jesus ever published. Graves tried to gather together all
of what was known at the time about other similar stories of gods who
walked the earth, preached ethical and mystical doctrines, and ended up
as deicides. Today, folklorists have discovered a set of world-wide
themes relating a story of a culture-hero who has a miraculous birth and
tragic death. This is one of the archetypal stories which Jung and
Campbell discussed. It is now considered less shocking that incidents in
religious narrative could be drawn from the global bank of folklore
motifs. This does not lessen the impact, however, on traditional
believers in these narratives as the absolute truth.

So is the need for a deathless hero who saves humanity part of the deep
structure of our brain? Is religion simply filling a psychological need
which is part of being human? This book may be picked apart in its
details; however, it was one of the first to explore this 'big'
question, an answer to which is as pressing today as it was then. The
World's Sixteen Crucified Saviors raised a host of questions, few of
which have yet been adequately answered, over a century later.

There are serious flaws in this book. Graves was apparently not working
from original sources, with the exception of the Bible; he seems to have
relied on books such as Higgins' Anacalypsis, without necessarily citing
them. He muddles Vaishnava Hinduism and Buddhism, two belief systems
with fundamental differences. That said, the traditional narratives of
Krishna and Buddha *do* contain motifs in common with the NT stories of
Jesus.

*Production notes*. This text first appeared on the Internet at another
site, in a slightly defective and added-emphasis version with a
disclaimer on each page. I have corrected the text to reflect the
original book as closely as possible, as per this sites' standards. Some
have criticized Graves for excessive typos (as if this was an
intellectual failing on his part), and there are certainly [a few in
this book](errata). However, I can state definitively after a modern
spell-check of the text that they are not particularly excessive
compared to any given book from this period.
