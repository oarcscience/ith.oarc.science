### CHAPTER III.

#### PROPHECIES BY THE FIGURE OF A SERPENT.

##### THE SEED OF THE WOMAN BRUISING THE SERPENT'S HEAD.

"AND I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed
and her seed. It shall bruise thy head, and thou shall bruise his heel."
(Gen. iii. 15.) This text is often cited by Christian writers and
controversialists as prefiguring the mission of the Christian Savior,
viz., the destruction of the serpent, *alias* the devil. St. John calls
"the grand adversary of souls which deceiveth the whole world," "the
dragon, the serpent, the devil, and Satan." (Rev. xii. 8.). The serpent,
then, is the devil; that is, the dragon, the serpent, the devil and
Satan are all one. The object of this chapter is to show the origin of
the singular figure set forth in the first text quoted, and to prove
that those Christian writers who assume it to be a revelation from
heaven were profoundly ignorant of oriental history, as the same figure
is found in several heathen systems of older date, as we will now cite
the facts to prove.

Some of the saviors or demigods of Egypt, India, Greece, Persia, Mexico
and Etruria are represented as performing the same drama with the
serpent or devil. "Osiris of Egypt (says Mr. Bryant) bruised the head of
the serpent after it had bitten his heel." Descending to Greece, Mr.

<span id="page_39">p. 39</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Faber relates
that, "on the spheres Hercules is represented in the act of contending
with the serpent, the head of which is placed under his foot; and this
serpent guarded the tree with golden fruit in the midst of the garden
Hesperides"—Eden. (Origin of Idolatry, vol. i. p. 443.) "And we may
observe," says this author, "the same tradition in the Phenician fable
of Ophion or Ophiones." (Ibid.) In Genesis the serpent is the subject of
two legends. But here it will be observed that they are both couched in
one.

 

Again, it is related by more than one oriental writer that Chrishna of
India is represented on some very ancient sculptures and stone monuments
with his heel on the head of a serpent. Mr. Maurice, in his Indian
Antiquities, vol. ii., speaks of "Chrishna crushing the head of a
serpent with his foot," and pronounces the striking similarity of this
story with that found in the Christian bible as "very mysterious."
Another author tells us "The image of Chrishna is sculptured in the
ancient temples of India, sometimes wreathed in the folds of a serpent
which is biting his foot, and sometimes treading victoriously on the
head of a serpent." (Prog. Rel. Ideas, vol. i.) In the Mexican
Antiquities, vol. vi., we are told, "A messenger from heaven announced
to the first woman created (Suchiquecul), that she should bear a son who
should bruise the serpent's head, and then presented her with a rose."
Here is the origin of the Genesis legend, the rose being the fruit of
the tree of "the knowledge of good and evil." "The ancient Persians,"
says Volney, in his "Ruin of Empires," p. 169, "had the tradition of a
virgin, from whom they predicted would be born, or would spring up, a
shoot (a son) that would crush the serpent's head, and thus deliver the
world from sin." And both the serpent and the virgin, he tells us, are
represented imaginarily in the heavens, and pictured on their
astronomical globes and spheres, as on

<span id="page_40">p. 40</span>

those of the Romish Christian. (See Burritt's Geography of the Heavens.)

In the ancient Etrurian story, instead of "the seed of the woman" (the
virgin), it is the woman herself who is represented as standing with one
foot on the head of a serpent, which has the twig of an apple tree in
its mouth to which an apple is suspended (the forbidden fruit), while
its tail is twisted around a celestial globe, thus reminding us of St.
John's dragon hauling down one-third of the stars with his tail, (See
Rev. xii. 4.) In the ancient celestial diagram of the Etrurian, the head
of the virgin is surmounted with a crown of stars—doubtless the same
legend from which St. John borrowed his metaphor of a "a woman with a
crown of twelve stars on her head." (Rev. xiii.) "The *Regina
Stellarum*" (Queen of the Stars), spoken of in some of the ancient
systems appertains to the same fable. Also the tradition of Achilles of
Greece being invulnerable in the heel, as related by Homer. The last
clause of the first text quoted reads "*It* shall bruise thy head"—a
very curious prophetic reference to the savior of the world, if the text
refers to him, to represent him as being of the neuter gender, for the
neuter pronoun *it* always refers to a thing without sex.

In the further exposition of the serpent tradition, we are now brought
to notice, and will trace to its origin, the story of the original
transgression and fall of man—two cardinal doctrines of the Christian
religion. Like every other tenet of the Christian faith, we find these
doctrines taught in heathen systems much older than Christianity, and
whose antiquity antedates even the birth of Moses. We will first notice
the Persian tradition. "According to the doctrine of the Persians," says
the Rev. J.C. Pitrat, "Meshia and Meshiane, the first man and first
woman, were pure, and submitted to Ormuzd, their maker. But Ahriman (the
evil one) saw them, and envied them their

<span id="page_41">p. 41</span>

happiness. He approached them under the form of a serpent, presented
fruits to them, and persuaded them that he was the maker of man, of
animals, of plants, and of the beautiful universe in which they dwelt.
They believed it. Since that time Ahriman was their master. Their
natures became corrupt, and this corruption infested their whole
posterity." This story is taken from the Vandidatsade of the Persians,
pp. 305 and 428.

 

The Indian or Hindoo story is furnished us by the Rev. Father Bouchat,
in a letter to the bishops of Avranches, and runs thus: "Our Hindoos say
the Gods tried by all means to obtain immortality. After many inquiries
and trials, they conceived the idea that they would find it in the tree
of life, which is the Chorcan (paradise). In fact they succeeded, and by
eating once in a while of the fruits of that tree, they kept the
precious treasure they so much valued. A famous snake, named Cheiden,
saw that the tree of life had been found by the Gods of the second
order. As probably he had been intrusted with guarding that tree, he
became so angry because his vigilance had been deceived, that he
immediately poured out an enormous quantity of poison, which spread over
the whole earth." How much like this story is the story of St. John,
"And the serpent cast out of his mouth water as a flood after the woman
that he might cause her to be carried away of the flood!" (Rev. xii.
15.)

The idea of a snake or serpent inundating the earth from its mouth, as
taught in both stories is so novel, and so far removed from the sphere
of natural causes and possible events, that we are compelled to the
conclusion that one is borrowed from the other, or both from a common
original.

 

And as facts cited in other chapters prove beyond dispute that the
Hindoo system, containing this story, extends in antiquity far beyond
the time of Moses, the question is

<span id="page_42">p. 42</span>

thus settled as to which system borrowed the story from the other.

Before closing the chapter, we wish to call the attention of the reader
to the important fact that three out of four of the cardinal doctrines
of the Christian faith are taught in the two heathen mythological
stories of creation just presented, viz.:—

1\. Original sin.

2\. The fall of man caused by a serpent.

3\. The consequent corruption and depravity of the human race.

These doctrines, then, it must be admitted, are of heathen origin, and
not, as Christians claim, "important truths revealed from heaven." For a
historical exposition of the other cardinal doctrine of the Christian
faith, viz., man's restoration by the atonement achieved through the
crucifixion of a God, see Chapters xvi. and xxi.
