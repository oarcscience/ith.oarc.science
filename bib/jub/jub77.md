### Pharaoh's Dreams and their Interpretation. Joseph's Elevation and Marriage (xl. 1-13; cf. Gen. xli.).

XL\. And in those days Pharaoh dreamed two dreams in one night
concerning a famine which was to be in all the land, and he awoke from
his sleep and called all the interpreters of dreams that were in Egypt,
and magicians, and told them his two dreams,

<span id="page_187">p. 187</span>

and they were not able to declare (them). 2. And then the chief butler
remembered Joseph and spake of him to the king, and he brought him forth
from the prison, and he told his two dreams before him. 3. And he said
before Pharaoh that his two dreams were one, and he said unto him:
"Seven years will come (in which there will be) plenty over all the land
of Egypt, and after that seven years of famine, such a famine as hath
not been in all the land. 4. And now let Pharaoh appoint overseers <span
id="fr_850"></span>[1](#fn_842.md) in all the land of Egypt, and let them
store up food in every city throughout the days of the years of plenty,
and there will be food for the seven years of famine, and the land will
not perish through the famine, for it will be very severe." 5. And the
Lord gave Joseph favour and mercy in the eyes of Pharaoh, and Pharaoh
said unto his servants: "We shall not find such a wise and discreet man
as this man, for the spirit of the Lord is with him." 6. And he
appointed him the second in all his kingdom and gave him authority over
all Egypt, and caused him to ride in the second chariot of Pharaoh. 7.
And he clothed him with byssus garments, and he put a gold chain upon
his neck, and (a herald) proclaimed before him "’Êl ’Êl wa’
Abîrĕr," <span id="fr_851"></span>[2](#fn_843.md) and he placed a ring on
his hand and made him ruler over all his house, and magnified him, and
said unto him: "Only on the throne shall I be greater than thou." 8. And
Joseph ruled over all the land of Egypt, and all the princes of Pharaoh,
and all his servants, and all who did the king's business loved him, for
he walked in uprightness, for he was without pride and arrogance, and he
had no respect of persons, and did not accept gifts, but he judged in
uprightness all the people of the land. 9. And the

land of Egypt was at peace before Pharaoh because of Joseph, for the
Lord was with him, and gave him favour and mercy for all his generations
before all those who knew him and those who heard concerning him, and
Pharaoh's kingdom was well ordered, and there was no Satan <span
id="fr_852"></span>[1](jub78.htm#fn_844) and no evil person (therein.md).
10. And the king called Joseph's name Sĕphânṭîphâns, <span
id="fr_853"></span>[2](jub78.htm#fn_845.md) and gave Joseph to wife the
daughter of Potiphar, the daughter of the priest of Heliopolis, the
chief cook. <span id="fr_854"></span>[3](jub78.htm#fn_846.md) 11. And on
the day that Joseph stood before Pharaoh he was thirty years old \[when
he stood before Pharaoh\]. 12. And in that year Isaac died. And it came
to pass as Joseph had said in the interpretation of his two dreams,
according as he had said it, there were seven years of plenty over all
the land of Egypt, and the land of Egypt produced abundantly, one
measure (producing) eighteen hundred measures. 13. And Joseph gathered
food into every city until they were full of corn until they could no
longer count and measure it for its multitude.

<span id="fn_842"></span>[187:1](jub77.htm#fr_850.md) Cf. Gen. xli. 34.

<span id="fn_843"></span>[187:2](jub77.htm#fr_851.md) *’Êl ’Êl wa’ Abîrĕr*
= Heb. *’el ’el wa’ăbîr ’el*, "God, God, the mighty one of God." This is
a peculiar amplification of the Hebrew *’abrēk* (R.V. "bow the knee ")
of Gen. xli. 43. "Mighty one of God" may be a technical term for a great
magician; cf. Acts viii. 10.
