IX\. And Ham divided amongst his sons, and the first portion came forth
for Cush <span id="fr_326"></span>[11](#fn_326.md) towards the east, and to
the west of him for Mizraim, <span id="fr_327"></span>[12](#fn_327.md) and
to the west

<span id="page_77">p. 77</span>

of him for Put, <span id="fr_328"></span>[1](#fn_328.md) and to the west of
him \[and to the west thereof\] on the sea <span
id="fr_329"></span>[2](#fn_329.md) for Canaan. <span
id="fr_330"></span>[3](#fn_330.md) 2. And Sherri also divided amongst his
sons, and the first portion came forth for Elam and his sons, to the
east of [the](errata.htm#0.md) river Tigris till it approacheth the east,
the whole land of India, and on the Red Sea on its coast, and the waters
of Dêdân, and all the mountains of Mebrî and ’Êlâ, and all the land of
Sûsân and all that is on the side of Pharnâk <span
id="fr_331"></span>[4](#fn_331.md) to the Red Sea and the river Tînâ. 3.
And for Asshur came forth the second portion, all the land of Asshur and
Nineveh and Shinar and to the border of India, and it ascendeth and
skirteth the river. 4. And for Arpachshad came forth the third portion,
all the land of the region of the Chaldees to the east of the Euphrates,
bordering on the Red Sea, and all the waters of the desert close to the
tongue of the sea which looketh towards Egypt, all the land of Lebanon
and Sanîr and ’Amânâ <span id="fr_332"></span>[5](#fn_332.md) to the border
of the Euphrates. 5. And for Aram <span id="fr_333"></span>[6](#fn_333.md)
there came forth the fourth portion, all the land of Mesopotamia between
the Tigris and the Euphrates to the north of the Chaldees to the border
of the mountains of Asshur and the land of ’Arârâ. <span
id="fr_334"></span>[7](#fn_334.md) 6. And there came forth for Lud <span
id="fr_335"></span>[8](#fn_335.md) the fifth portion, the mountains of
Asshur and all appertaining to them till it reacheth the Great Sea, and
till it reacheth the east of Asshur his brother. 7. And Japheth also
divided the land of his inheritance amongst his sons. 8. And the first
portion came forth for Gomer to the east from the north side to the
river Tînâ; and in the north there came forth for Magog all the inner
portions of the north until it reacheth to the sea of Mê’at. 9 And

<span id="page_78">p. 78</span>

for Madai came forth as his portion that he should possess from the west
of his two brothers to the islands, <span
id="fr_336"></span>[1](#fn_336.md) and to the coasts of the islands. 10.
And for Javan <span id="fr_337"></span>[2](#fn_337.md) came forth the
fourth portion every island <span id="fr_338"></span>[3](#fn_338.md) and
the islands which are towards the border of Lud. 11. And for Tubal <span
id="fr_339"></span>[4](#fn_339.md) there came forth the fifth portion in
the midst of the tongue which approacheth towards the border of the
portion of Lud to the second tongue, to the region beyond the second
tongue unto the third tongue. <span id="fr_340"></span>[5](#fn_340.md) 12.
And for Meshech came forth the sixth portion, all the region beyond the
third tongue <span id="fr_341"></span>[6](#fn_341.md) till it approacheth
the east of Gâdîr. <span id="fr_342"></span>[7](#fn_342.md) 13. And for
Tiras <span id="fr_343"></span>[8](#fn_343.md) there came forth the seventh
portion, four great islands <span id="fr_344"></span>[9](#fn_344.md) in the
midst of the sea, which reach to the portion of Ham \[and the islands of
Kamâtûrî came out by lot for the sons of Arpachshad as his
inheritance\]. <span id="fr_345"></span>[10](#fn_345.md) 14. And thus the
sons of Noah divided unto their sons in the presence of Noah their
father, and he bound them all by an oath, imprecating a curse on every
one that sought to seize the portion which had not fallen (to him) by
his lot. 15. And they all said, "So be it; so be it," for themselves and
their sons for ever throughout their generations till the day of
judgment, on which the Lord God shall judge them with a sword and with
fire, for all the unclean wickedness of their errors, wherewith they
have filled the earth with transgression and uncleanness and fornication
and sin.
