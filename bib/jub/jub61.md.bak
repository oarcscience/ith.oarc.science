### Jacob, reconciled with Esau, dwells in Canaan and supports his Parents (xxix. 13-20; Cf. Gen. xxxii., xxxiii.).

13\. And he passed over the Jabbok <span id="fr_700"></span>[5](#fn_698.md)
in the ninth month, on the eleventh thereof. And on that day Esau, his
brother, came to him, and he was reconciled to him, and departed from
him unto the land of Seir, but Jacob dwelt in tents. 14. And in the

year of the fifth week in this jubilee he crossed the Jordan, and dwelt
beyond the Jordan, and he pastured his sheep from the sea †of the
heap† <span id="fr_701"></span>[6](#fn_699.md) unto Bethshan, <span
id="fr_702"></span>[7](#fn_700.md) and unto Dothan and unto the
†forest† <span id="fr_703"></span>[8](#fn_701.md) of Akrabbim. 15. And he
sent to his father Isaac of all his substance, clothing, and food, and
meat, and drink, and milk, and butter, and cheese, and some dates of the
valley, 16. And to his mother Rebecca also four times a year, between
the times of the months, between ploughing and reaping, and between
autumn and the rain (season) and between winter

and spring, to the tower of Abraham. 17. For Isaac had returned from the
Well of the Oath and gone up to the tower of his father Abraham, and he
dwelt there apart from his son Esau. 18. For in the days when Jacob went
to Mesopotamia, Esau took to himself a wife Mahalath, the daughter of
Ishmael, and he gathered together all the flocks of his father and his
wives, and went up and dwelt on Mount Seir, and left Isaac his father at
the Well of the Oath alone. <span id="fr_704"></span>[1](#fn_702.md) 19.
And Isaac went up from the Well of the Oath and dwelt in the tower of
Abraham his father on the mountains of Hebron, 20. And thither Jacob
sent all that he did send to his father and his mother from time to
time, all they needed, and they blessed Jacob with all their heart and
with all their soul.
