### Rebecca admonishes Jacob not to marry a Canaanitish Woman. Rebecca's Blessing (xxv. 1-23; cf. Gen. xxviii. 1-4). <span id="fr_656"></span>[1](#fn_654.md)

XXV\. And in the second year of this week in this

jubilee, Rebecca called Jacob her son, and spake unto him, saying: "My
son, do not take thee a wife of the daughters of Canaan, as Esau, thy
brother, who took him two wives of the daughters of Canaan, <span
id="fr_657"></span>[2](#fn_655.md) and they have embittered my soul <span
id="fr_658"></span>[3](#fn_656.md) with all their unclean deeds: for all
their deeds are fornication and lust, and there is no righteousness with
them, for (their deeds) are evil. 2. And I, my son, love thee
exceedingly, and my heart and my affection bless thee every hour of the
day and watch of the night. 3. And now, my son, hearken to my voice, and
do the will of thy mother, and do not take thee a wife of the daughters
of this land, but only of the house of my father, and of my father's
kindred. Thou wilt take thee a wife of the house of my father, and the
Most High God will bless thee, and thy children will be a righteous
generation and a holy seed." 4. And then spake Jacob to Rebecca, his
mother, and said unto her: "Behold, mother, I am nine weeks <span
id="fr_659"></span>[4](#fn_657.md) of years old, and I neither know nor
have I touched any woman, nor have I betrothed myself to any, nor even
think of taking me a wife of the daughters of Canaan. 5. For I remember,

<span id="page_138">p. 138</span>

mother, the words of Abraham, our father, for he commanded me not to
take a wife of the daughters of Canaan, but to take me a wife from the
seed of my father's house and from my kindred. 6. I have heard before
that daughters have been born to Laban, thy brother, and I have set my
heart on them to take a wife from amongst them. 7. And for this reason I
have guarded myself in my spirit against sinning or being corrupted in
all my ways throughout all the days of my life; for with regard to lust
and fornication, Abraham, my father, gave me many commands. <span
id="fr_660"></span>[1](#fn_658.md) 8. And, despite all that he hath
commanded me, these two and twenty years my brother hath striven with
me, and spoken frequently to me and said: 'My brother, take to wife a
sister of my two wives'; but I refuse to do as he hath done. 9. I swear
before thee, mother, that all the days of my life I will not take me a
wife from the daughters of the seed of Canaan, and I will not act
wickedly as my brother hath done. 19. Fear not, mother; be assured that
I shall do thy will and walk in uprightness, and not corrupt my ways for
ever." 11. And thereupon she lifted up her face to heaven and extended
the fingers of her hands, and opened her mouth and blessed the Most High
God, who had created the heaven and the earth, and she gave Him thanks
and praise. 12. And she said: "Blessed be the Lord God, and may His holy
name be blessed for ever and ever, who hath given me Jacob as a pure son
and a holy seed; for He is Thine, and Thine shall his seed be
continually and throughout all the generations for evermore. 13. Bless
him, O Lord, and place in my mouth the blessing of righteousness, that I
may bless him." 14. And at that hour, when the spirit of
righteousness <span id="fr_661"></span>[2](#fn_659.md) descended into her
mouth, she placed both her hands on the head of Jacob, and said:

<span id="page_139">p. 139</span>

15\. "Blessed art thou, Lord of righteousness and God of the ages;  
And may He bless thee beyond all the generations of men.  
May He give thee, my son, the path of righteousness,  
And reveal righteousness to thy seed.  
16. And may He make thy sons many during thy life,  
And may they arise according to the number of the months of the year.  
And may their sons become many and great beyond the stars of heaven,  
And their numbers be more than the sand of the sea.  
17. And may He give them this goodly land--as He said He would give it
to Abraham and to his seed after him alway <span
id="fr_662"></span>[1](#fn_660.md)--  
And may they hold it as a possession for ever.  
18. And may I see (born) unto thee, my son, blessed children during my
life,  
And a blessed and holy seed may all thy seed be.  
19. And as thou hast refreshed thy mother's spirit during †my† <span
id="fr_663"></span>[2](#fn_661.md) life,  
The womb of her that bare thee blesseth thee,  
\[My affection\] and my breasts bless thee  
And my mouth and my tongue praise thee greatly.  
20. Increase and spread over the earth,  
And may thy seed be perfect in the joy of heaven and earth for ever;  
And may thy seed rejoice,  
And on the great day of peace may it have peace.  
21. And may thy name and thy seed endure to all the ages,  
And may the Most High God be their God,  
And may the God of righteousness dwell with them, <span id="page_140">p.
140</span>  
And by them may His sanctuary be built unto all the ages. <span
id="fr_664"></span>[1](#fn_662.md)  
22. Blessed be he that blesseth thee,  
And all flesh that curseth thee falsely may it be cursed." <span
id="fr_665"></span>[2](#fn_663.md)  
23. And she kissed him, and said to him  
"May the Lord of the world love thee  
As the heart of thy mother and her affection rejoice in thee and bless
thee."  
And she ceased from blessing.
