### Abram seeks to convert Terah from Idolatry; the Family of Terah (cf. Gen. xi. 27-30). Abram burns the Idols. Death of Haran (cf. Gen. xi. 28) (xii. 1-14).

XII\. And it came to pass in the

sixth week, in the seventh year thereof, that Abram said to Terah his
father, saying, "Father!" And he said, "Behold, here am I, my son." 2.
And he said,

<span id="page_88">p. 88</span>

"What help and profit have we from those idols which thou dost
worship,  
And before which thou dost bow thyself? <span
id="fr_388"></span>[1](#fn_388.md)

3\. For there is no spirit in them, <span
id="fr_389"></span>[2](#fn_389.md)  
For they are dumb forms, and a misleading of the heart.  
Worship them not:

4\. Worship the God of heaven,  
Who causeth the rain and the dew to descend on the earth, <span
id="fr_390"></span>[3](#fn_390.md)  
And doeth everything upon the earth,

And hath created everything by His word, <span
id="fr_391"></span>[4](#fn_391.md)  
And all life is from before His face.

5\. Why do ye worship things that have no spirit in them?  
For they are the work of (men's) hands, <span
id="fr_392"></span>[5](#fn_392.md)

And on your shoulders do ye bear them, <span
id="fr_393"></span>[6](#fn_393.md)  
And ye have no help from them,

But they are a great cause of shame to those who make them,  
And a misleading of the heart to those who worship them:  
Worship them not."

6\. And his father said unto him, "I also know it, my son, but what
shall I do with a people who have made me to serve before them? 7. And
if I tell them the truth, they will slay me; for their soul cleaveth

<span id="page_89">p. 89</span>

to them to worship them and honour them. Keep silent, <span
id="fr_394"></span>[1](#fn_394.md) my son, lest they slay thee." 8. And
these words he spake to his two brothers, and they were angry with him
and he kept silent. 9. And in the fortieth jubilee, in the second week,
in the seventh year

thereof, Abram took to himself a wife, and her name was Sarai, the
daughter of his father, and she became his wife. <span
id="fr_395"></span>[2](#fn_395.md) 10. And Haran, his brother, took to
himself a wife in the third year of the third week, and she bare him a
son in the seventh year of this

week and he called his name Lot. 11. And Nahor, his brother, took to
himself a wife. <span id="fr_396"></span>[3](#fn_396.md) 12. And in the
sixtieth year of the life of Abram, that is, in the fourth

week, in the fourth year thereof, Abram arose by night, and burned the
house of the idols, and he burned all that was in the house, and no man
knew it. 13. And they arose in the night and sought to save their gods
from the midst of the fire. 14. And Haran hasted to save them, but the
fire flamed over him, and he was burnt in the fire, and he died in Ur of
the Chaldees before Terah his father, and they buried him in Ur of the
Chaldees. <span id="fr_397"></span>[4](#fn_397.md)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_388"></span>[88:1](jub29.htm#fr_388.md) In 1-14 we have an
early form of the legend of Abram's protest against idolatry. This
section has remarkable parallels, both in thought and expression, with
chaps. i.-viii. of the Apocalypse of Abraham. In the later (Rabbinic)
forms of the legend Abram's birth excites the alarm of Nimrod, who
endeavours to destroy him in a furnace of fire.

<span id="fn_389"></span>[88:2](jub29.htm#fr_389.md) Cf. Ps. cxxxv. 17.

<span id="fn_390"></span>[88:3](jub29.htm#fr_390.md) Cf. XX. 9; Jer. xiv.
22.

<span id="fn_391"></span>[88:4](jub29.htm#fr_391.md) Cf. Ps. xxxiii. 6:
Heb. xi. 3; 2 Pet. iii. 5; 4 Ezra vi. 38.

<span id="fn_392"></span>[88:5](jub29.htm#fr_392.md) Cf. Jer. x. 3, 9.

<span id="fn_393"></span>[88:6](jub29.htm#fr_393.md) Cf. Isa. xlvi. 7; Jer.
x. 5; Assumpt. Moses, viii. 4.

<span id="fn_394"></span>[89:1](jub29.htm#fr_394.md) In *Ap. Abraham* Terah
is indignant with Abraham for deriding the idols.

<span id="fn_395"></span>[89:2](jub29.htm#fr_395.md) Cf. Gen. xx. 12,
according to which Sarah was Abraham's half-sister. According to
Rabbinic tradition marriage with half-sisters on the father's side was
permitted to the descendants of Noah. In Lev. xviii. 9, 11, xx. 17,
marriage with a sister or half-sister is strictly forbidden.

<span id="fn_396"></span>[89:3](jub29.htm#fr_396.md) According to Gen. xi.
29, Milcah.

<span id="fn_397"></span>[89:4](jub29.htm#fr_397.md) In *Ap. Abraham*,
viii. the fire descends from heaven and burns the house and all in it
(including Terah). Only Abraham, escapes.
