### Jacob's Flight with his Family: his Covenant with Laban (xxix. 1-12; cf. Gen, xxxi.).

XXIX\. And it came to pass when Rachel had borne Joseph, that Laban went
to shear his sheep; for they were distant from him a three days'
journey. 2. And Jacob saw that Laban was going to shear his

<span id="page_151">p. 151</span>

sheep, and Jacob called Leah and Rachel, and spake kindly unto them that
they should come with him to the land of Canaan. 3. For he told them how
he had seen everything in a dream, even all that He had spoken unto him
that he should return to his father's house; and they said: "To every
place whither thou goest we will go with thee." 4. And Jacob blessed the
God of Isaac his father, and the God of Abraham his father's father, and
he arose and mounted his wives and his children, and took all his
possessions and crossed the river, and came to the land of Gilead, and
Jacob hid <span id="fr_692"></span>[1](#fn_690.md) his intention from

Laban and told him not. 5. And in the seventh year of the fourth week
Jacob turned (his face) toward Gilead in the first month, on the
twenty-first thereof. And Laban pursued after him and overtook Jacob in
the mountain of Gilead in the third month, on the thirteenth thereof. 6.
And the Lord did not suffer him to injure Jacob; for He appeared to him
in a dream by night. And Laban spake to Jacob, 7. And on the fifteenth
of those days Jacob made a feast for Laban, and for all who came with
him, and Jacob sware to Laban that day, and Laban also to Jacob, that
neither should cross the mountain of Gilead to the other with evil
purpose. 8. And he made there a heap for a witness; wherefore the name
of that place is called: "The Heap of Witness," after this heap. <span
id="fr_693"></span>[2](#fn_691.md) 9. But before they used to call the land
of Gilead the land of the Rephaim; <span id="fr_694"></span>[3](#fn_692.md)
for it was the land of the Rephaim, and the Rephaim were born (there),
giants whose height was ten, nine, eight down to seven cubits. 10. <span
id="fr_695"></span>[4](#fn_693.md) And their habitation was from the land
of the children of Ammon to Mount Hermon, and the seats of their kingdom
were Karnaim and

<span id="page_152">p. 152</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Ashtaroth, <span id="fr_696"></span>[1](#fn_694.md)
and Edrei, and Mîsûr, <span id="fr_697"></span>[2](#fn_695.md) and
Beon. <span id="fr_698"></span>[3](#fn_696.md) 11. And the Lord destroyed
them because of the evil of their deeds; for they were very malignant,
and the Amorites dwelt in their stead, wicked and sinful, and there is
no people to-day which hath wrought to the full all their sins, and they
have no longer length of life on the earth. <span
id="fr_699"></span>[4](#fn_697.md) 12. And Jacob sent away Laban, and he
departed into Mesopotamia, the land of the East, and Jacob returned to
the land of Gilead.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_686"></span>[150:1](jub59.htm#fr_688.md) Gen. XXX. 28 has
"appoint me thy wages."

<span id="fn_687"></span>[150:2](jub59.htm#fr_689.md) A wrong rendering of
the Hebrew (Gen. xxx. 32), which means "speckled" (*nāḳōd*).

<span id="fn_688"></span>[150:3](jub59.htm#fr_690.md) Speckled and black,
variously marked LXX ποικίλα καὶ σποδοιεδῆ ῥαντά does not represent
σποδοειδῆ.

<span id="fn_689"></span>[150:4](jub59.htm#fr_691.md) And sheep so LXX
(Gen. xxx. 43); but MT and other versions omit.

<span id="fn_690"></span>[151:1](jub60.htm#fr_692.md) So LXX (Gen. xxxi.
20) and Targ. Onkelos; but MT Sam., Vulg., ''stole" (the heart of
Laban).

<span id="fn_691"></span>[151:2](jub60.htm#fr_693.md) Cf. Gen. xxxi. 47
("Galeed" = "Heap of Witness").

<span id="fn_692"></span>[151:3](jub60.htm#fr_694.md) Cf. Gen. xiv. 5.

<span id="fn_693"></span>[151:4](jub60.htm#fr_695.md) The places here
mentioned were, perhaps, associated with Maccabean victories in the mind
of our author (Charles).

<span id="fn_694"></span>[152:1](jub60.htm#fr_696.md) In MT of Gen. xiv. 5,
Asheroth-karnaim is one place; but Syr. and some MSS. of LXX support our
text. Karnaim was captured by. Judas Maccabæus (1 Macc. 43 f.).

<span id="fn_695"></span>[152:2](jub60.htm#fr_697.md) In Deut. iii. 10
"plain" = *mîshôr*.

<span id="fn_696"></span>[152:3](jub60.htm#fr_698.md) = probably the *Bæan*
of 1 Macc. v. 4 f., which was destroyed by Judas.

<span id="fn_697"></span>[152:4](jub60.htm#fr_699.md) Judas "must have
nearly annihilated" the Amorites (Charles).
