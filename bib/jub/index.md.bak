*The Book of Jubilees*, probably written in the 2nd century B.C.E., is
an account of the Biblical history of the world from creation to Moses.
It is divided into periods ('Jubilees') of 49 years. For the most part
the narrative follows the familiar account in Genesis, but with some
additional details such as the names of Adam and Eve's daughters, and an
active role for a demonic entity called 'Mastema'. The anonymous author
had a preoccupation with calendar reform, and uses *Jubilees* as a
platform for proposing a solar calendar of 364 days and 12 months; this
would have been a radical departure from [the Jewish
Calendar](../../time/cal/jdate.md), which is lunar-based. There are also a
couple of messianic, apocalyptic passages, although quite a bit less
than the Book of Enoch.

The only complete version of *Jubilees* is in Ethiopian, although large
fragments in Greek, Latin and Syriac are also known. It is believed that
it was originally written in Hebrew. If at times one gets the impression
that you are reading a first draft of Genesis, you are in good company.
R.H. Charles, the translator, a distinguished academic Biblical scholar,
concluded that *Jubilees* was a version of the Pentateuch, written in
Hebrew, parts of which later became incorporated into the earliest Greek
version of the Jewish Bible, the Septuagint.
