### Noah's Sacrifice; God's Covenant with him (cf. Gen. viii. 20-ix. 17). Instructions to Moses about eating of Blood, the Feast of Weeks, etc., and Division of the Year (vi. 1-38).

V1. And on the new moon of the third month he went forth from the ark,
and built an altar on that mountain. <span
id="fr_209"></span>[8](#fn_209.md) 2. And he made atonement for the
earth, <span id="fr_210"></span>[9](#fn_210.md) and took a kid and made
atonement by its blood for

<span id="page_61">p. 61</span>

all the guilt of the earth; for everything that had been on it had been
destroyed, save those that were in the ark with Noah. 3. And he placed
the fat thereof on the altar, and he took an ox, and a goat, and a sheep
and kids, and salt, and a turtle-dove, and the young of a dove, and
placed a burnt sacrifice on the altar, and poured thereon an offering
mingled with oil, and sprinkled wine and strewed frankincense over
everything, and caused a goodly savour to arise, acceptable before the
Lord. <span id="fr_211"></span>[1](#fn_211.md) 4. And the Lord smelt the
goodly savour, <span id="fr_212"></span>[2](#fn_212.md) and He made a
covenant with him that there should not be any more a flood to destroy
the earth; <span id="fr_213"></span>[3](#fn_213.md) that all the days of
the earth seed-time and harvest should never cease; cold and heat, and
summer and winter, and day and night should not change their order, nor
cease for ever. <span id="fr_214"></span>[4](#fn_214.md) 5. "And you,
increase ye and multiply upon the earth, and become many upon it, and be
a blessing upon it. <span id="fr_215"></span>[5](#fn_215.md) The fear of
you and the dread of you I shall inspire in everything that is on earth
and in the sea. <span id="fr_216"></span>[6](#fn_216.md) 6. And behold I
have given unto you all beasts, and all winged things, and everything
that moveth on the earth, and the fish in the waters, and all things for
food; as the green herbs, I have given you all things to eat. <span
id="fr_217"></span>[7](#fn_217.md) 7. But flesh, with the life thereof,
with the blood, ye shall not eat; for the life of all flesh is in the
blood, lest your blood of your lives be required. At the hand of every
man, at the hand of every (beast), shall I require the blood of
man. <span id="fr_218"></span>[8](#fn_218.md) 8. Whoso sheddeth man's blood
by man shall his blood be shed; for in the image of God made He
man. <span id="fr_219"></span>[9](#fn_219.md) 9. And you, increase ye, and
multiply on the earth." 10. And Noah and his sons swore that they would
not eat

<span id="page_62">p. 62</span>

any blood that was in any flesh, and he made a covenant before the Lord
God for ever throughout all the generations of the earth in this month.
11. On this account He spake to thee <span
id="fr_220"></span>[1](#fn_220.md) that thou shouldst make a covenant with
the children of Israel in this month upon the mountain with an oath, and
that thou shouldst sprinkle blood <span id="fr_221"></span>[2](#fn_221.md)
upon them because of all the words of the covenant, which the Lord made
with them for ever. 12. And this testimony is written concerning you
that you should observe it continually, so that you should not eat on
any day any blood of beasts or birds or cattle during all the days of
the earth, and the man who eateth the blood of beast or of cattle or of
birds during all the days of the earth, he and his seed shall be rooted
out of the land. 13. And do thou command the children of Israel to eat
no blood, so that their names and their seed may be before the Lord our
God continually. <span id="fr_222"></span>[3](#fn_222.md) 14. And for this
law there is no limit of days, for it is for ever. They shall observe it
throughout their generations, so that they may continue supplicating on
your behalf with blood before the altar; <span
id="fr_223"></span>[4](#fn_223.md) every day and at the time of morning and
evening they shall seek forgiveness <span
id="fr_224"></span>[5](#fn_224.md) on your behalf perpetually before the
Lord that they may keep it and not be rooted out. 15 And He gave to
Noah <span id="fr_225"></span>[6](#fn_225.md) and his sons a sign that
there should not again be a flood on the earth. 16. He set His bow in
the cloud for a sign of the eternal covenant that there should not again
be a flood on the earth to destroy it all the days of the earth. <span
id="fr_226"></span>[7](#fn_226.md) 17. For this reason it is ordained and
written on the heavenly tables, that they should celebrate the feast

<span id="page_63">p. 63</span>

of weeks <span id="fr_227"></span>[1](#fn_227.md) in this month once a
year, to renew the covenant every year. 18. And this whole festival was
celebrated in heaven from the day of creation till the days of
Noah-twenty-six jubilees and five weeks of years: and Noah and his sons
observed it for seven jubilees and one week of years, till the day of
Noah's death, and from the day of

|                |
|----------------|
| 1309-1659 A.M. |

Noah's death his sons did away with (it) until the days of Abraham, and
they ate blood. <span id="fr_228"></span>[2](#fn_228.md) 19. But Abraham
observed it, and Isaac and Jacob and his children observed it up to thy
days, and in thy days the children of Israel forgot it until ye
celebrated it anew on this mountain. 20. And do thou command the
children of Israel to observe this festival in all their generations for
a commandment unto them: one day <span id="fr_229"></span>[3](#fn_229.md)
in the year in this month they shall celebrate the festival. 21. For it
is the feast of weeks and the feast of first-fruits: <span
id="fr_230"></span>[4](#fn_230.md) this feast is twofold and of a double
nature: <span id="fr_231"></span>[5](#fn_231.md) according to what is
written and engraven concerning it celebrate it. 22. For I have written
in the book of the first law, <span id="fr_232"></span>[6](#fn_232.md) in
that which I have written for thee, that thou shouldst celebrate it in
its season, one day <span id="fr_233"></span>[7](#fn_233.md) in the year,
and I explained to thee its sacrifices that the children of Israel
should remember and should celebrate it throughout their generations in
this month, one day in every year. 23. And on the new moon of the first
month, and on the new moon of the fourth

<span id="page_64">p. 64</span>

month, and on the new moon of the seventh month, and on the new moon of
the tenth month are the days of remembrance, and the days of the seasons
in the four divisions of the year. <span id="fr_234"></span>[1](#fn_234.md)
These are written and ordained as a testimony for ever. 24. And Noah
ordained them for himself as feasts for the generations for ever, so
that they have become thereby a memorial unto him. 25. And on the new
moon of the first month he was bidden to make for himself an ark, and on
that (day) the earth became dry and he opened (the ark) and saw the
earth. 26. And on the new moon of the fourth month the mouths of the
depths of the abysses beneath were closed. And on the new moon of the
seventh month all the mouths of the abysses of the earth were opened,
and the waters began to descend into them. <span
id="fr_235"></span>[2](#fn_235.md) 27. And on the new moon of the tenth
month the tops of the mountains were seen, and Noah was glad. <span
id="fr_236"></span>[3](#fn_236.md) 28. And on this account he ordained them
for himself as feasts for a memorial for ever, and thus are they
ordained. 29. And they placed them on the heavenly tables, each had
thirteen weeks; from one to another (passed) their memorial, from the
first to the second, and from the second to the third, and from the
third to the fourth. 30. And all the days of the commandment will be two
and fifty weeks of days, and (these will make) the entire year
complete. <span id="fr_237"></span>[4](#fn_237.md) 31. Thus it is engraven
and ordained on the heavenly tables. And

<span id="page_65">p. 65</span>

there is no neglecting (this commandment) for a single -year or from
year to year. 32. And command thou the children of Israel that they
observe the years according to this reckoning-three hundred and
sixty-four days, and (these) will constitute a complete year, and they
will not disturb its time from its days and from its feasts; for
everything will fall out in them according to their testimony, and they
will not leave out any day nor disturb any feasts. <span
id="fr_238"></span>[1](#fn_238.md) 33. But if they do neglect and do not
observe them according to His commandment, then they will disturb all
their seasons, and the years will be dislodged from this (order), \[and
they will disturb the seasons and the years will be dislodged\] <span
id="fr_239"></span>[2](#fn_239.md) and they will neglect their ordinances.
34. And all the children of Israel will forget, and will not find the
path of the years, and will forget the new moons, and seasons, and
sabbaths, and they will go wrong as to all the order of the years. <span
id="fr_240"></span>[3](#fn_240.md) 35. For I know and from henceforth shall
I declare it unto thee, and it is not of my own devising; for the book
(lieth) written before me, and on the heavenly tables the division of
days is ordained, lest they forget the feasts of the covenant and walk
according to the feasts of the Gentiles after their error and after
their ignorance. 36. For there will be those who will assuredly make
observations of the moon--now (it) disturbeth the seasons and cometh in
from year to year ten days too soon. <span
id="fr_241"></span>[4](#fn_241.md) 37. For this reason the years will come
upon them when they will disturb (the order),

<span id="page_66">p. 66</span>

and make an abominable (day) the day of testimony, and an unclean day a
feast day, and they will confound all the days, the holy with the
unclean, and the unclean day with the holy; for they will go wrong as to
the months and sabbaths and feasts and jubilees. 38. For this reason I
command and testify to thee that thou mayest testify to them; for after
thy death thy children will disturb (them), so that they will not make
the year three hundred and sixty-four days only, and for this reason
they will go wrong as to the new moons <span
id="fr_242"></span>[1](#fn_242.md) and seasons and sabbaths and festivals,
and they will eat all kinds of blood with all kinds of flesh.

-Note that in our text here 11-14 deal with the Mosaic development of
the covenant with Noah.

<span id="fn_225"></span>[62:6](jub20.htm#fr_225.md) The text here returns
to Noah.

<span id="fn_226"></span>[62:7](jub20.htm#fr_226.md) Cf. Gen. ix. 13-15.

<span id="fn_227"></span>[63:1](jub20.htm#fr_227.md) The "Feast of Weeks"
(cf. Exod. xxxiv. 22) is here only connected with Noah's covenant, the
establishment of which it is supposed to commemorate. Later Judaism
associated it with the giving of the Law on Sinai. It was celebrated,
according to our Book, on the 15th day of the 3rd month.

<span id="fn_228"></span>[63:2](jub20.htm#fr_228.md) Notice that the
non-observance of the Feast signalizes the breaking of the
covenant-condition about eating blood.

<span id="fn_229"></span>[63:3](jub20.htm#fr_229.md) Or "the first day" (of
the week). See 22 below.

<span id="fn_230"></span>[63:4](jub20.htm#fr_230.md) It is called "the day
of first-fruits" in Num. xxviii. 26.

<span id="fn_231"></span>[63:5](jub20.htm#fr_231.md) "Of a double nature"
in that (?) it commemorates the covenant with Noah, and also has an
agricultural character.

<span id="fn_232"></span>[63:6](jub20.htm#fr_232.md) *i. e.* the
Pentateuch.

<span id="fn_233"></span>[63:7](jub20.htm#fr_233.md) Or "the first day" (of
the week) = Sunday. Consequently, Pentecost would always fall on the
same day of the week, Sunday. This accords with the Sadducean view.

<span id="fn_234"></span>[64:1](jub20.htm#fr_234.md) According to Lev.
xxiii. 24 only the 1st day of the 7th month was a "day of memorial." The
"four days" here mentioned correspond to the four intercalary days
"which are not reckoned in the reckoning of the year" mentioned in 1
Enoch lxxv. 1. They introduce the four quarters of the year and
apparently, according to the scheme of 1 Enoch and our Book, were
intended to be added to the 360 days (= 12 x 30), which made up the
solar year (360 + 4 days).

<span id="fn_235"></span>[64:2](jub20.htm#fr_235.md) Cf. 1 Enoch lxxxix. 7,
8.

<span id="fn_236"></span>[64:3](jub20.htm#fr_236.md) Cf. Gen. viii. 5.

<span id="fn_237"></span>[64:4](jub20.htm#fr_237.md) If the year consists
of 52 weeks (= 4 X 13 weeks), how can it be divided into 12 months of 30
days each, which is the reckoning implied throughout the Book? For the
solutions proposed see Charles's discussion, *ad loc.*

<span id="fn_238"></span>[65:1](jub20.htm#fr_238.md) The effect of a solar
year reckoned at 364 days would be that the festivals would always be
celebrated on the same day of the week. Nisan 14 would always fall on a
Sabbath, Nisan 22 (when the wave sheaf was to be offered) on a Sunday,
and the Feast of Weeks, Sivan 15, on a Sunday. There is some reason to
suppose that this conception of a solar year of 364 days has a dogmatic
basis. See Introd., p. xvii.

<span id="fn_239"></span>[65:2](jub20.htm#fr_239.md) The bracketed words
are a dittograph.

<span id="fn_240"></span>[65:3](jub20.htm#fr_240.md) For 33-34 cf. 1 Enoch
lxxxii. 4-6.

<span id="fn_241"></span>[65:4](jub20.htm#fr_241.md) A lunar year consists
Of 354 days. Our author wages a polemic against the use of the moon for
determining the seasons and feasts. But a lunar year was accepted by the
Pharisees.

<span id="fn_242"></span>[66:1](jub20.htm#fr_242.md) Render (for "new
moons") "beginnings of the months."
