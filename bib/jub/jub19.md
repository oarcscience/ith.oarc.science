### The Building of the Ark; the Flood (v. 21-32; cf. Gen. vi. 13-viii. 19).

21\. And He commanded Noah to make him an ark, that he might save
himself from the waters of the flood. <span

respects as He commanded him, in the twenty-seventh jubilee

of years, in the fifth week in the fifth year (on the new moon of the
first month). 23. And he entered in the sixth (year) thereof, in the
second month, on

the new moon of the second month, till the sixteenth; and he entered,
and all that we brought to him, into the ark, and the Lord closed <span
id="fr_199"></span>[3](#fn_199.md) it from without on the seventeenth <span
id="fr_200"></span>[4](#fn_200.md) evening.

24\. And the Lord opened seven flood-gates <span
id="fr_201"></span>[5](#fn_201.md) of heaven,  
And the mouths of the fountains of the great deep, seven mouths in
number.

25\. And the flood-gates began to pour down water from the heaven forty
days and forty nights,  
And the fountains of the deep also sent up waters, until the whole world
was full of water.

26\. And the waters increased upon the earth  
Fifteen cubits did the waters rise above all the high mountains, <span

And the ark was lift up above the earth,  
And it moved upon the face of the waters. <span
id="fr_202"></span>[1](#fn_202.md)

27\. And the water prevailed on the face of the earth five months-one
hundred and fifty days. <span id="fr_203"></span>[2](#fn_203.md) 28. And
the ark went and rested on the top of Lûbâr, one of the mountains of
Ararat. <span id="fr_204"></span>[3](#fn_204) 29. And (on the new moon.md)
in the fourth month the fountains of the great deep were closed and the
flood-gates of heaven were restrained; and on the new moon of the
seventh month all the mouths of the abysses of the earth were opened,
and the water began to descend into the deep

below. <span id="fr_205"></span>[4](#fn_205.md) 30. And on the new moon of
the tenth month the tops of the mountains were seen, and on the new moon
of the first month the earth became visible. <span
id="fr_206"></span>[5](#fn_206.md) 31. And the waters disappeared from
above the earth in the fifth week in the seventh year thereof, and on
the seventeenth <span id="fr_207"></span>[6](#fn_207.md) day in the second
month the earth was dry. 32. And on the twenty-seventh thereof he opened
the ark, and sent forth from it beasts, and cattle, and birds, and every
moving thing. <span id="fr_208"></span>[7](#fn_208.md)
