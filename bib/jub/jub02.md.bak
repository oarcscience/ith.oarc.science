# INTRODUCTION

### SHORT ACCOUNT OF THE BOOK

THE Book of Jubilees, or, as it is sometimes called, "the little
Genesis," purports to be a revelation given by God to Moses through the
medium of an angel (" the Angel of the Presence," i. 27), and containing
a history, divided up into jubilee-periods of forty-nine years, from the
creation to the coming of Moses. Though the actual narrative of events
is only carried down to the birth and early career of Moses, its author
envisages the events of a later time, and in particular certain events
of special interest at the time when he wrote, which was probably in the
latter years of the second century B.C., perhaps in the reign of the
Maccabean prince John Hyrcanus. Though distinguished from the Pentateuch
proper ("the first Law," vi. 22), it presupposes and supplements the
latter. The actual narrative embraces material contained in the whole of
Genesis and part of Exodus. But the legal regulations given presuppose
other parts of the Pentateuch, especially the so-called "Priest's Code"
(P), and certain details in the narrative are probably intended to apply
to events that occurred in the author's own time (the latter years of
the second century B.C.). The author himself seems to have contemplated
the speedy inauguration of the Messianic Age, and in this respect his
point of view is similar to that of the Apocalyptic writers. But his
work, though it contains one or two passages of an apocalyptic
character, is quite unlike the typical apocalypses. It is largely
narrative based upon the historical narratives in Genesis and

<span id="page_viii">p. viii</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Exodus, interspersed with legends, and
emphasizing certain legal practices (such as the strict observance of
the Sabbath, circumcision, etc.), and laying much stress upon their
eternal obligation. But his main object was to inculcate a reform in the
regulation of the calendar and festivals, in place of the intercalated
lunar calendar, which he condemns in the strongest language. He proposes
to substitute for this a solar calendar consisting of 12 months and
containing 364 days. The result of such a system is to make all
festivals, except the Day of Atonement, fall on a Sunday; the author
also fixes the date of the Feast of Weeks (Pentecost) on Sivan 15th (in
place of the traditional Sivan 6th). He obviously believes that the
prevailing system has produced grave consequences in religious practice.
The proper observance of the feasts, which had been prescribed by divine
authority, is, according to his view, rendered impossible so long as the
right principles for regulating the calendar are ignored. These
principles are justified from the written Law, and are represented as
having been ordained in heaven. To what party or tendency in Judaism did
the author belong? Various answers have been given to this question,
which will be fully discussed below. It is very difficult to believe, as
Dr. Charles contends, that the author was a Pharisee, for the positions
he advocates are in many respects fundamentally opposed to later
Pharisaic practice. In particular, how can any member of the Pharisaic
party, which from its beginning championed popular religious custom,
have advocated a solar calendar? More can be said for the view that the
author was a member of the Hasidim or "pious" (who must not be
confounded with the Pharisees), while in a recent important discussion
Leszynsky has made out a strong, if not quite convincing, case for
Sadducean authorship. The Book has sometimes been styled a Midrash, but
such a descriptive term needs some qualification. It claims to be a
revelation, and not a mere exposition of Genesis and

<span id="page_ix">p. ix</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Exodus. At the same time, there is a certain
Midrashic tendency observable in the way the author rewrites the older
narratives, which reminds one of the work of the Chronicler as compared
with the earlier canonical books which he remodelled. But *Jubilees* is
not at all like the typical Midrash of the later Rabbinical period; it
is more independent, and resembles rather such works as the "*Chronicles
of Jerahmeel*," or the earlier (narrative) part of the "Apocalypse of
Abraham."

The Book, which was probably composed in Hebrew, is divided into fifty
chapters, and appears to be complete.
