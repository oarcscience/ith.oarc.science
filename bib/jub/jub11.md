# THE BOOK OF JUBILEES

### Prologue

THIS is the history of the division of the days <span
id="fr_30"></span>[1](#fn_30.md) of the law and of the testimony, of the
events of the years, of <span id="fr_31"></span>[2](#fn_31) their (year.md)
weeks, of their jubilees throughout all the years of the world, <span
id="fr_32"></span>[3](#fn_32.md) as the Lord spake to Moses on Mount Sinai
when he went up to receive the tables of the law and of the commandment,
according to the voice of God as He said unto him, "Go up to the top of
the Mount." <span id="fr_33"></span>[4](#fn_33.md)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_30"></span>[35:1](jub11.htm#fr_30.md) The Prologue sums up the
contents of the Book as at once a *history* and a *chronological system
based upon the number seven*.

<span id="fn_31"></span>[35:2](jub11.htm#fr_31.md) *i. e.* according to
(their year-weeks): a year-week = seven years (cf. Lev. xxv. 8 f.).

<span id="fn_32"></span>[35:3](jub11.htm#fr_32.md) The writer apparently
intended to write a history from Creation to the establishment of the
Messianic Kingdom.

<span id="fn_33"></span>[35:4](jub11.htm#fr_33.md) Cf. Exod. xxiv. 12.
