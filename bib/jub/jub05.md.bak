### AFFINITIES WITH OTHER LITERATURE

Though there is no reason to doubt the essential unity of our Book (that
is to say, that it was composed and written in its present form by one
author), it is equally clear that this writer incorporated earlier
traditions and legends into his work. Thus he refers explicitly to
Noachic writings (xxi. 10; cf. x. 13), and has apparently incorporated
two considerable sections of a "Book of Noah" in vii. 20-39 and x. 1-15.
It is well-known that this Noachic Book was also one of the sources of
the Book of Enoch, 1 Enoch, vi.-xi., 1x., lxv.-lxix. 25, and cvi.-cvii.
being probably derived from it. There is reason, also, to believe that
the author of *Jubilees* was acquainted with some form of the Book of
Enoch (1 Enoch). According to Charles the parts of 1 Enoch with which
our author was acquainted are 1 Enoch vi-xvi., xxiii.-xxxvi. and
lxxii.-xc. He seems clearly to refer to the last section in iv. 17:

*And he* \[*Enoch*\] *was the first among men that are born on earth who
learnt writing and knowledge and wisdom and who wrote down the signs of
heaven according to the order of their months in a book, that men might
know the seasons of the years according to the order of their separate
months*.

Here the Enoch-book referred to forms a description of 1 Enoch
lxxii.-lxxxii. ("the Book of the courses of the Heavenly Luminaries "),
while iv. 19 (*And* 

<span id="page_xiv">p. xiv</span>

*what was and what will be he saw in a vision of his sleep, as it will
happen to the children of men throughout their generations until the day
of judgement; he saw and understood everything, and wrote his testimony,
and placed the testimony on earth for all the children of men and for
their generations*) forms an exact description of the "Dream-Visions" in
1 Enoch lxxxiii.-xc. <span id="fr_7"></span>[1](#fn_7.md). There are also a
number of parallels with the *Testaments of the XII Patriarchs*, but
these are not sufficient to show dependence on either side; the
phenomena rather suggest that both writers are using common sources: Cf.
xxviii. 9; xxx. 2-6, 18, 25; xxxi. 3-4, 13, 15, 16; xxxii. 1, 8; xxxiii.
1, 2, 4; xxxiv. 1-9; xxxvii.-xxxviii.; xli. 8-14, 24-25, xlvi. 6-9.

It has already been mentioned that a knowledge of our Book seems to be
presupposed in some of the later Jewish literature. Thus the *Chronicles
of Jerahmeel*, a late compilation written in Hebrew, contains much
material common to *Jubilees*; at times it reproduces the actual words
of the text of the latter. Another late Jewish work, the Midrash
*Tadshe*, contains passages which are largely identical with portions of
the text of our Book. This Midrash was compiled in its present form by
Moses ha-Darshan in the eleventh century A.D., but is based upon a much
earlier work by R. Pinchas b. Jair (end of second century, A.D.), who
utilized materials from our Book. Besides the above, our Book appears to
have been known to the compiler of the Samaritan Chronicle (twelfth
century, A.D.), and also to the compiler of the *Pirḳe de R. Eliezer*
(finally redacted in the ninth century A.D.). In fact, in both cases
there is implicit a certain amount of polemic (especially in
calendar-matters) against the positions advocated in *Jubilees*. But
besides this, there is a remarkable parallelism in subject-matter
between our Book and the *Pirḳe de R. Eliezer*, to which Friedlander
calls attention. He points out that both "are alike in being practically
Midrashic paraphrases

<span id="page_xv">p. xv</span>

and expansions of the narratives contained in the Book of Genesis and
part of the Book of Exodus. . . . Both books deal with the Calendar . .
. and in this respect they recall the Books of Enoch." Both "have
chapters setting forth the story of the Creation (*Ma‘aseh Bereshith*).
. . . The past is recalled and the future revealed. The nature of God,
angels and man is unfolded. We read of sin and grace, repentance and
atonement, good and evil, life and death, Paradise and Gehenna, Satan
and Messiah." <span id="fr_8"></span>[1](#fn_8.md)

Numerous references to *Jubilees* occur in Christian literature
(patristic period and later), where long extracts from the Book are
often cited, and by name. These have been collected by Charles (*op.
cit.*, pp. lxxvii ff.), who also cites a number of parallels between our
Book and the New Testament. But these are somewhat vague, and are hardly
sufficient to establish any real or direct connexion.
