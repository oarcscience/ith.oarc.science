### Jacob's Visions. He celebrates the eighth day of Tabernacles. The Birth of Benjamin and Death of Rachel (xxxii. 16-34; cf. Gen. xxxv.).

16\. And on the following night, on the twenty-second day of this month,
Jacob resolved to build that place, and to surround the court with a
wall, and to sanctify it and make it holy for ever, for himself and his
children after him. 17. And the Lord appeared to him by night and
blessed him and said unto him: "Thy name shall not be called Jacob, but
Israel shall they name thy name." 18. And He said unto him again: "I am
the Lord who created the heaven and the earth, and I shall increase thee
and multiply thee exceedingly, and kings will come forth from thee, and
they will judge everywhere wherever the foot of the sons of men hath
trodden. 19. Ana I shall give to thy seed all the earth <span
id="fr_748"></span>[2](#fn_745.md) which is under heaven, and they will
judge all the nations according to their desires, and after that they
will get possession of the whole earth and inherit it for ever." 20. And
He finished speaking with him, and He went up from him, and Jacob looked
till He had ascended into heaven. <span id="fr_749"></span>[3](#fn_746.md)
21. And he saw in a vision of the night, and behold an angel descended
from heaven with seven tablets <span id="fr_750"></span>[4](#fn_747.md) in
his hands, and he gave them to Jacob, and he read them and knew all that
was written therein which would befall him and his sons through-

<span id="page_165">p. 165</span>

out all the ages. <span id="fr_751"></span>[1](#fn_748.md) 22. And he
showed him all that was written on the tablets, and said unto him: "Do
not build this place, and do not make it an eternal sanctuary, <span
id="fr_752"></span>[2](#fn_749.md) and do not dwell here; for this is not
the place. Go to the house of Abraham thy father and dwell with Isaac
thy father until the day of the death of thy father. 23. For in
[Egypt](errata.htm#2.md) thou wilt die in peace, and in this land thou wilt
be buried with honour in the sepulchre of thy fathers, with Abraham and
Isaac. 24. Fear not, for as thou hast seen and read it, thus will. it
all be; and do thou write down everything as thou hast seen and read."
25. And Jacob said: "Lord, how can I remember all that I have read and
seen?" And he said unto him: "I will bring all things to thy
remembrance." <span id="fr_753"></span>[3](#fn_750.md) 26. And he went up
from him, and he awoke from his sleep, and he remembered everything
which he had read and seen, and he wrote down all the words which he had
read and seen. 27. And he celebrated there yet another day, <span
id="fr_754"></span>[4](#fn_751.md) and he sacrificed thereon according to
all that he sacrificed on the former days, and called its name
†"Addition,"† <span id="fr_755"></span>[5](#fn_752.md) for †this day was
added,† <span id="fr_756"></span>[5](#fn_752.md) and the former days he
called "The Feast." <span id="fr_757"></span>[6](#fn_753.md) 28. And thus
it was manifested that it should be, and it is written on the heavenly
tables: wherefore it was revealed to him that he should celebrate it,
and add it to the seven days of the feast. 29. <span
id="fr_758"></span>[7](#fn_754.md) And its name

<span id="page_166">p. 166</span>

was called †"Addition," † †because that† it was recorded amongst the
days of the feast days, †according to† the number of the days of the
year. 30. And in the night, on the twenty-third of this month, Deborah
Rebecca's nurse died, and they buried her beneath the city under the oak
of the river, and he called the name of this place, "The river of
Deborah," and the oak, "The oak of the mourning of Deborah." <span
id="fr_759"></span>[1](#fn_755.md) 31. And Rebecca went and returned to her
house to his father Isaac, and Jacob sent by her hand rams and sheep and
he-goats that she should prepare a meal for his father such as he
desired. 32. And he went after his mother till he came to the land of
Kabrâtân, <span id="fr_760"></span>[2](#fn_756.md) and he dwelt there. 33.
And Rachel bare a son in the night, and called his name "Son of my
sorrow"; for she suffered in giving him birth: but his father called his
name Benjamin, on the eleventh of the eighth month in the first of the
sixth week of this

jubilee. 34. And Rachel died there and she was buried in the land <span
id="fr_761"></span>[3](#fn_757.md) of Ephrath, the same is Bethlehem, and
Jacob built a pillar on the grave of Rachel, on the road above her
grave.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_745"></span>[164:2](jub66.htm#fr_748.md) For 17-18 cf. Gen.
xxxv. 10-12. Notice that the whole inhabited earth (not merely
Palestine, as in Gen. xxxv. 12) is here promised to Israel.

<span id="fn_746"></span>[164:3](jub66.htm#fr_749.md) Cf. Gen. xxxv. 13.

<span id="fn_747"></span>[164:4](jub66.htm#fr_750.md) Cf. 4 Ezra xiv. 24.

<span id="fn_748"></span>[165:1](jub66.htm#fr_751.md) Cf. xlv. 4.

<span id="fn_749"></span>[165:2](jub66.htm#fr_752.md) The sanctuary at
Bethel was not to be the one central shrine, where alone acceptable
worship was to be offered.

<span id="fn_750"></span>[165:3](jub66.htm#fr_753.md) In 4 Ezra xiv. 40,
Ezra's memory is said to have been miraculously strengthened after he
had received the cup of inspiration; cf. also John xiv. 26.

<span id="fn_751"></span>[165:4](jub66.htm#fr_754.md) *i. e.* the eighth
day of the Feast of Tabernacles.

<span id="fn_752"></span>[165:5](jub66.htm#fr_756.md) The Hebrew name is
*‘a<u>s</u>ereth* (*‘a<u>s</u>arta*), from a root meaning "detain"
(*‘āṣar*). Hence, perhaps, we may emend here "keeping back," for on that
day he was kept back (Charles).

<span id="fn_753"></span>[165:6](jub66.htm#fr_757.md) So in Rabbinic the
Feast of Tabernacles was called, *par excellence*, "the Feast."

<span id="fn_754"></span>[165:7](jub66.htm#fr_758.md) 29 is very corrupt.
Charles suggests that it should be read: "And its name was called 'a
keeping back' (*i.e.* *‘aṣereth*) when it was recorded amongst the days
of the feast days in the number of the days of the year."

<span id="fn_755"></span>[166:1](jub66.htm#fr_759.md) Cf. Gen. xxxv. 8
(R.V. marg.).

<span id="fn_756"></span>[166:2](jub66.htm#fr_760.md) Due to a
misunderstanding of the words rendered "some distance" (*kibrath
hā’are<u>s</u>*) in Gen. xxxv. 16. The LXX also took kibrath to be a
proper name (Χιβραθο).

<span id="fn_757"></span>[166:3](jub66.htm#fr_761.md) "On the way to" in
the text of Gen. xxxv. 19.
