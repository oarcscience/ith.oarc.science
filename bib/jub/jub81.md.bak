### Jacob, celebrates the Feast of First-fruits and journeys to Egypt. List of his Descendants. (xliv. 1-34; cf. Gen. xlvi. 1-28).

XLIV\. And Israel took his journey from †Haran† <span
id="fr_870"></span>[1](#fn_862.md) from his house on the new moon of the
third month, and he went on the way of the Well of the Oath, <span
id="fr_871"></span>[2](#fn_863.md) and he offered a sacrifice to the God of
his father Isaac on the seventh of this month. 2. And Jacob remembered
the dream that he had seen at Bethel, <span
id="fr_872"></span>[3](#fn_864.md) and he feared to go down into Egypt. 3.
And while he was thinking of sending word to Joseph to come to him, and
that he would not go down, he remained there seven days, if perchance he
should see a vision as to whether he should remain or go down. 4. And

<span id="page_197">p. 197</span>

he celebrated the harvest festival of the first-fruits <span
id="fr_873"></span>[1](#fn_865.md) with old grain, for in all the land of
Canaan there was not a handful of seed (in the land), for the famine was
over all the beasts and cattle and birds, and also over man. 5. And on
the sixteenth the Lord appeared unto him, and said unto him, "Jacob,
Jacob"; and he said, "Here am I." And He said unto him: "I am the God of
thy fathers, the God of Abraham and Isaac; fear not to go down into
Egypt, for I will there make of thee a great nation. 6. I shall go down
with thee, and I shall bring thee up <span
id="fr_874"></span>[2](#fn_866) (again.md), and in this land wilt thou be
buried, and Joseph will put his hands upon thy eyes. Fear not; go down
into Egypt." 7. And his sons rose up, and his sons' sons, and they
placed their father and their possessions upon wagons. 8. And Israel
rose up from the Well of the Oath on the sixteenth of this third month,
and he went to the land of Egypt. 9. And Israel sent Judah before him to
his son Joseph to examine <span id="fr_875"></span>[3](#fn_867.md) the Land
of Goshen, for Joseph had told his brothers that they should come and
dwell there that they might be near him. 10. And this was the goodliest
(land) in the land of Egypt, and near to him, for all (of them) and also
for the cattle. 11. And these are the names of the sons of Jacob who
went into Egypt with Jacob their father. 12. <span
id="fr_876"></span>[4](#fn_868.md) Reuben, the first-born of Israel; and
these are the names of his sons: Enoch, and Pallu, and Hezron and
Carmi--five. <span id="fr_877"></span>[5](#fn_869.md) 13. Simeon and his
sons; and these are the names of his sons: Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad,

<span id="page_198">p. 198</span>

and Jachin, and Zohar, and Shaul, the son of the Zephathite <span
id="fr_878"></span>[1](#fn_870.md) woman--seven. 14. Levi and his sons; and
these are the names of his sons: Gershon, and Kohath, and Merari--four.
15. Judah and his sons; and these are the names of his sons: Shela, and
Perez, and Zerah--four. 16. Issachar and his sons; and these are the
names of his sons: Tola, and Phûa, <span id="fr_879"></span>[2](#fn_871.md)
and Jâsûb, <span id="fr_880"></span>[3](#fn_872.md) and Shimron--five. 17.
Zebulon and his sons; and these are the names of his sons: Sered, and
Elon, and Jahleel--four. 18. And these are the sons of Jacob, and their
sons, whom Leah bore to Jacob in Mesopotamia, six, and their one sister,
Dinah: and all the souls of the sons of Leah, and their sons, who went
with Jacob their father into Egypt, were twenty-nine, and Jacob their
father being with them, they were thirty. 19. And the sons of Zilpah,
Leah's handmaid, the wife of Jacob, whom she bore unto Jacob, Gad and
Asher. 20. And these are the names of their sons who went with him into
Egypt: the sons of Gad: Ziphion, and Haggi, and Shuni, and Ezbon, (and
Eri) and Areli, and Arodi--eight. 21. And the sons of Asher: Imnah, and
Ishvah, (and Ishvi), and Beriah, and Serah, their one sister--six. 22.
All the souls were fourteen, and all those of Leah were forty-four. 23.
And the sons of Rachel, the wife of Jacob: Joseph and Benjamin. 24. And
there were born to Joseph in Egypt before his father came into Egypt,
those whom Asenath, daughter of Potiphar priest of Heliopolis bare unto
him, Manasseh, and Ephraim--three. 25. And the sons of Benjamin: Bela
and Becher, and Ashbel, Gera, and Naaman, and Ehi, and Rosh, and Muppim,
and Huppim, and Ard--eleven. 26. And all the souls of Rachel were
fourteen. 27. And the sons of Bilhah, the handmaid of Rachel, the wife
of Jacob, whom she

<span id="page_199">p. 199</span>

bare to Jacob, were Dan and Naphtali. 28. And these are the names of
their sons who went with them into Egypt. And the sons of Dan were
Hushim, and Sâmôn, and Asûdî, and ’Îjâka, and Salômôn--six. 29. And they
died the year in which they entered into Egypt, and there was left to
Dan Hushim alone. <span id="fr_881"></span>[1](#fn_873.md) 30. And these
are the names of the sons of Naphtali: Jahziel, and Guni, and Jezer, and
Shallum, and ‘Îv. <span id="fr_882"></span>[2](#fn_874.md) 31. And ‘Îv, who
was born after the years of famine, died in Egypt. 32. And all the souls
of Rachel were twenty-six. 33. And all the souls of Jacob which went
into Egypt were seventy souls. These are his children and his children's
children, in all seventy; but five died in Egypt before Joseph, and had
no children. 34. And in the land of Canaan two sons of Judah died, Er
and Onan, and they had no children, and the children of Israel buried
those who perished, and they were reckoned among the seventy Gentile
nations.

<span id="fn_868"></span>[197:4](jub81.htm#fr_876.md) The number 70,
according to our text, includes Jacob with his descendants. Another
reckoning makes up the number by excluding Jacob himself: cf. Exod. i. 5
and Gen. xlvi. 15, 18, 21, 25, 27. The number 75, in Acts vii. 14. is
due to the LXX of Exod. i. 5 and Deut. X. 22. There are certain
differences in detail between the list in our text and the details given
in Genesis; see Charles *ad loc.*

<span id="fn_869"></span>[197:5](jub81.htm#fr_877.md) The father is
included in each case.

"Hushim" (MT) is mentioned alone.

<span id="fn_874"></span>[199:2](jub81.htm#fr_882.md) Cf. Gen. xlvi. 24 and
1 Chron. vii. 13: *‘Iv* is omitted in both texts.
