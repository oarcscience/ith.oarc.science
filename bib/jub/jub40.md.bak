### The Sacrifice of Isaac: Abraham returns to Beersheba (xviii. 1-19; Cf. Gen. xxii. 1-19).

XVIII\. And God said to him, "Abraham, Abraham"; and he said, "Behold,
(here) am I." <span id="fr_508"></span>[2](#fn_507.md). And He said, "Take
thy beloved <span id="fr_509"></span>[3](#fn_508.md) son whom thou lovest,
(even) Isaac, and go unto the high country, <span
id="fr_510"></span>[4](#fn_509.md) and offer him on one of the mountains
which I will point out unto thee." 3. And he rose early in the morning
and saddled his ass, and took his two young men with him, and Isaac his
son, and clave the wood of the burnt-offering, and he went to the place
on

<span id="page_110">p. 110</span>

the third day, and he saw the place afar off. 4. And he came to a well
of water, and he said to his young men, "Abide ye here with the ass, and
I and the lad shall go (yonder), and when we have worshipped we shall
come again to you." 5. And he took the wood of the burnt-offering and
laid it on Isaac his son, and he took in his hand the fire and the
knife, and they went both of them together to that place. 6. And Isaac
said to his father, "Father"; and he said, "Here am I, my son." And he
said unto him, "Behold the fire, and the knife, and the wood; but where
is the sheep for the burnt-offering, father?" 7. And he said, "God will
provide for himself a sheep for a burnt-offering, my son." And he drew
near to the place of the mount of God. <span
id="fr_511"></span>[1](#fn_510.md) 8. And he built an altar, and he placed
the wood on the altar, and bound Isaac his son, and placed him on the
wood which was upon the altar, and stretched forth his hand to take the
knife to slay Isaac his son. 9. And I stood before him, and before the
prince of the Mastêmâ, <span id="fr_512"></span>[2](#fn_511.md) and the
Lord said, "Bid him not to lay his hand on the lad, nor to do anything
to him, for I have shown that he feareth the Lord." 10. And I called to
him from heaven, and said unto him: "Abraham, Abraham"; and he was
terrified and said: "Behold, (here) am I." 11. And I said unto him: "Lay
not thy hand upon the lad, neither do thou anything to him; for now I
have shown that thou fearest the Lord, and hast not withheld thy son,
thy first-born son, from me." 12. And the prince of the Mastêmâ was put
to shame; and Abraham lifted up his eyes and looked, and, behold, a
single ram caught <span id="fr_513"></span>[3](#fn_512.md) . . . by his
horns, and Abraham went and took the ram and offered it for a
burnt-offering in the stead of his son. 13. And Abraham called

<span id="page_111">p. 111</span>

that place "The Lord hath seen," so that it is said "(in the mount) the
Lord hath seen": <span id="fr_514"></span>[1](#fn_513.md) that is Mount
Sion. 14. And the Lord called Abraham by his name a second time from
heaven, as he caused us to appear to speak to him in the name of the
Lord.

15\. And He said: "By Myself have I sworn, saith the Lord,  
Because thou hast done this thing,  
And hast not withheld thy son, thy beloved <span
id="fr_515"></span>[2](#fn_514.md) son, from Me,

That in blessing I shall bless thee  
And in multiplying I shall multiply thy seed

As the stars of heaven,  
And as the sand which is on the seashore.

And thy seed will inherit the cities <span
id="fr_516"></span>[3](#fn_515.md) of its enemies,  
16. And in thy seed will all nations of the earth be blessed;

Because thou hast obeyed My voice,  
And I have shown to all that thou art faithful unto Me in all that I
have said unto thee:  
Go in peace." <span id="fr_517"></span>[4](#fn_516.md)

\[paragraph continues\] 17. And Abraham went to his young men, and they
arose and went together to Beersheba, and Abraham dwelt by the Well of
the Oath. 18. And he celebrated this festival every year, seven days
with joy, and he called it the festival of the Lord according to the
seven days during which he went and returned in peace. 19. And
accordingly hath it been ordained and written on the heavenly tables
regarding Israel and its seed that they should observe this festival
seven days with the joy of festival.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_506"></span>[109:1](jub39.htm#fr_506.md) In Gen. xxii. 1 it is
God Himself who directly proves Abraham.

<span id="fn_507"></span>[109:2](jub40.htm#fr_508.md) Seven of the
traditional ten trials of Abraham are here mentioned: (1) Departure from
his country; (2) famine; (3) the wealth of kings; (4) seizure of his
wife; (5) circumcision; (6) and (7) expulsion of Hagar and Ishmael \[(8)
is the unfruitfulness of Sarah; (9) the sacrifice of Isaac, and (10) the
burial of Sarah; Cf. xiv. 21 and xix. 3, 8\]. Slightly different
enumerations occur elsewhere (*e. g.* *Pirḳe de R. Eliezer*,
xxvi.-xxx.).

<span id="fn_508"></span>[109:3](jub40.htm#fr_509.md) So LXX (Gen. xxii.
2): MT *only* (*son*).

<span id="fn_509"></span>[109:4](jub40.htm#fr_510.md) So LXX; but NIT "the
land of Moriah."

<span id="fn_510"></span>[110:1](jub40.htm#fr_511.md) Instead of the words
*of the mount of God*, MT (Gen. xxii. 9) reads, *which God hath told him
of*.

<span id="fn_511"></span>[110:2](jub40.htm#fr_512.md) Here (cf., also,
xviii. 12, xlvii. 9, 12, 15), Mastêmâ is the name given to the whole
class of evil spirits, or Satans; elsewhere of the prince of these
himself.

<span id="fn_512"></span>[110:3](jub40.htm#fr_513.md) ? add *in a thicket*.

<span id="fn_513"></span>[111:1](jub40.htm#fr_514.md) Syr. and Vulg. render
(Gen. xxii. 14) "will see," "seeth." MT "it shall be seen" (provided).

<span id="fn_514"></span>[111:2](jub40.htm#fr_515.md) MT "thine only" (Gen.
xxii. 16).

<span id="fn_515"></span>[111:3](jub40.htm#fr_516.md) So Sam., version,
LXX: MT "gate" (Gen. xxii. 17).

<span id="fn_516"></span>[111:4](jub40.htm#fr_517.md) Cf. 1 Sam. i. 17.
