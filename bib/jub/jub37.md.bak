### Abraham at Beersheba. Birth and Circumcision of Isaac (cf. Gen. xxi. 1-4). Institution of the Feast of Tabernacles (xvi. 10-31).

10\. And in this month Abraham moved from Hebron, and departed and dwelt
between Kadesh and Shur in the mountains <span
id="fr_472"></span>[1](#fn_472.md) of Gerar. 11. And in the middle of the
fifth month he moved from thence, and dwelt at the Well of the
Oath. <span id="fr_473"></span>[2](#fn_473.md) 12. <span
id="fr_474"></span>[3](#fn_474.md) And in the middle of the sixth month the
Lord visited Sarah and did unto her as He had spoken, and she conceived.

13\. And she bare a son in the third month, and in the middle of the
month, <span id="fr_475"></span>[4](#fn_475.md) at the time of which the
Lord had spoken to Abraham, on the festival of the first-fruits of the
harvest, <span id="fr_476"></span>[5](#fn_476.md) Isaac was born. 14. And
Abraham circumcised his son on the eighth day: he was the first that was
circumcised according to the covenant which is ordained for ever. 15.
And in the sixth year of the †fourth† <span
id="fr_477"></span>[6](#fn_477.md) week we came to Abraham, to the Well of
the Oath, and we appeared unto him \[as we had told Sarah that we should
return to her, and she would have conceived a son. 16. And we returned
in the seventh month, and found Sarah with child before us\] <span
id="fr_478"></span>[7](#fn_478.md) and we blessed him, and we announced to
him all the things which had been decreed concerning him, that he should
not die till he should beget six sons more, <span
id="fr_479"></span>[8](#fn_479) and should see (them.md) before he died;
but (that) in Isaac should his name and seed be called: <span
id="fr_480"></span>[9](#fn_480) 17. And (that.md) all the seed of his sons
should be Gentiles, and be reckoned with the Gentiles; but from the sons
of Isaac one should

<span id="page_105">p. 105</span>

become a holy seed, and should not be reckoned among the Gentiles. <span
id="fr_481"></span>[1](#fn_481.md) 18. For he should become the portion of
the Most High, <span id="fr_482"></span>[2](#fn_482.md) and all his seed
had fallen into the possession of God, that it should be unto the Lord a
people for (His) possession <span id="fr_483"></span>[3](#fn_483.md) above
all nations and that it should become a kingdom and priests and a holy
nation. <span id="fr_484"></span>[4](#fn_484.md) 19. And we went our way,
and we announced to Sarah all that we had told him, and they both
rejoiced with exceeding great joy. 20. And he built there an altar to
the Lord who had delivered him, and who was making him rejoice in the
land of his sojourning, and he celebrated a festival of joy in this
month seven days, <span id="fr_485"></span>[5](#fn_485.md) near the altar
which he had built at the Well of the Oath. 21. And he built booths for
himself and for his servants on this festival, and he was the first to
celebrate the feast of tabernacles on the earth. 22. And during these
seven days he brought each day to the altar a burnt-offering to the
Lord, two oxen, <span id="fr_486"></span>[6](#fn_486.md) two rams, seven
sheep, <span id="fr_487"></span>[7](#fn_487.md) one he-goat, for a
sin-offering, that he might atone thereby for himself and for his seed.
23. And, as a thank-offering, seven rams, seven kids, seven sheep, and
seven he-goats, and their fruit-offerings and their
drink-offerings; <span id="fr_488"></span>[8](#fn_488.md) and he burnt all
the fat thereof on the altar, a chosen offering unto the Lord for a
sweet smelling savour. 24. And morning and evening he burnt fragrant
substances, <span id="fr_489"></span>[9](#fn_489.md) frankincense

<span id="page_106">p. 106</span>

and galbanum, and stacte, and nard, and myrrh, and spice, and costum;
all these seven he offered, crushed, mixed together in equal parts (and)
pure. 25. And he celebrated this feast during seven days, rejoicing with
all his heart and with all his soul, he and all those who were in his
house; and there was no stranger with him, nor any that was
uncircumcised. 26. And he blessed his Creator who had created him in his
generation, for He had created him according to His good pleasure; for
He knew and perceived that from him would arise the plant of
righteousness <span id="fr_490"></span>[1](#fn_490.md) for the eternal
generations, and from him a holy seed, so that it should become like Him
who had made all things. 27. And he blessed and rejoiced, and he called
the name of this festival the festival of the Lord, a joy acceptable to
the Most High God. 28. And we blessed him for ever, and all his seed
after him throughout all the generations of the earth, because he
celebrated this festival in its season, according to the testimony of
the heavenly tables. 29. For this reason it is ordained on the heavenly
tables concerning Israel, that they shall celebrate the feast of
tabernacles seven days with joy, in the seventh month, acceptable before
the Lord--a statute for ever throughout their generations every
year. <span id="fr_491"></span>[2](#fn_491.md) 30. And to this there is no
limit of days; for it is ordained for ever regarding Israel that they
should celebrate it and dwell in booths, and set wreaths upon their
heads, <span id="fr_492"></span>[3](#fn_492.md) and take leafy boughs, and
willows from the brook. <span id="fr_493"></span>[4](#fn_493.md) 31. And
Abraham took branches of palm trees, and the fruit of goodly trees, and
every day going round the altar with the branches seven times <span
id="fr_494"></span>[5](#fn_494.md)

<span id="page_107">p. 107</span>

\[paragraph continues\] \[a day\] in the morning, he praised and gave
thanks to his God for all things in joy.

<span id="fn_492"></span>[106:3](jub37.htm#fr_492.md) This custom in

however, Wisdom ii. 7 f.; Josephus, *Ant.* xix. 9, 1. Bridegrooms wore
wreaths, but the custom was later abolished. See further Introduction,
