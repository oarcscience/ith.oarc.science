the land, besides the first famine, which had been in the days of
Abraham. <span id="fr_640"></span>[2](#fn_638.md) 3. And Jacob sod lentil
pottage, and Esau came from the field hungry. And he said to Jacob his
brother: "Give me of this red pottage." <span
id="fr_641"></span>[3](#fn_639.md) And Jacob said to him: "Sell to me thy
\[primogeniture, this\] birthright and I will give thee bread, and also
some of this lentil pottage." 4. And Esau said in his heart: "I shall
die; of what profit to me is this birthright?" And he said to Jacob: "I
give it to thee." 5. And Jacob said "Swear to me, this day," and he
sware unto him. 6. And Jacob gave his brother Esau bread and pottage,
and he ate till he was satisfied, and Esau despised his birthright; for
this reason was Esau's name called Edom, <span
id="fr_642"></span>[4](#fn_640.md) on account of the red pottage which
Jacob gave him for his birthright. 7. And Jacob became the elder, and
Esau was brought down from his dignity.
