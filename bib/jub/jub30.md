### The Family of Terah in Haran; Abram's Experiences there; his Journey to Canaan (xii. 15-31; cf. Gen. xi, 31-xii. 3).

15\. And Terah went forth from Ur of the Chaldees, he and his sons, to
go into the land of Lebanon and into the land of Canaan, and he dwelt in
the land of Haran, and Abram, dwelt with Terah his father in

<span id="page_90">p. 90</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Haran two weeks of years. <span
id="fr_398"></span>[1](#fn_398) 16. And in the sixth week, in the fifth
year thereof, Abram sat up throughout the night on the new moon of the
seventh month to observe the stars from the evening to the morning, in
order to see what would be the character of the year with regard to the
rains, and he was alone as he sat and observed. 17. And a word came into
his heart and he said: "All the signs of the stars, and the signs of the
moon and of the sun are all in the hand of the Lord. Why do I search
(them) out?

18\. If He desireth, He causeth it to rain, morning and evening;  
And if He desireth, He withholdeth it, And all things are in His hand."

19\. And he prayed that night and said  
"My God, God Most High, Thou alone art my God,  
And Thee and Thy dominion have I chosen.  
And Thou hast created all things,  
And all things that are are the work of Thy hands.

20\. Deliver me from the hands of evil spirits who have sway over the
thoughts of men's hearts,  
And let them not lead me astray from Thee, my God.  
And stablish Thou me and my seed for ever  
That we go not astray from henceforth and for evermore."

\[paragraph continues\] 21. And he said Shall I return unto Ur of the
Chaldees who seek my face that I may return to them, or am I to remain
here in this place? The right path before Thee prosper it in the hands
of Thy servant that he may fulfil (it) and that I may not walk in the
deceitfulness of my heart, O my God." 22. And he made an end of speaking
and praying, and behold the word of the Lord was sent to him through me,
saying: "Get thee up from thy country, and from thy kindred and from the
house of thy father unto a land which I shall show thee, and I shall
make thee a great and numerous nation.

23\. And I shall bless thee  
And I shall make thy name great,

And thou wilt be blessed in the earth,  
And in thee will all families of the earth be blessed,

And I shall bless them that bless thee,  
And curse them that curse thee. <span id="fr_399"></span>[1](#fn_399)

\[paragraph continues\] 24. And I shall be a God to thee and thy son,
and to thy son's son, and to all thy seed: fear not, from henceforth and
unto all generations of the earth I am thy God." 25. And the Lord God
said: "Open his mouth and his ears, that he may hear and speak with his
mouth, with the language which hath been revealed"; <span
id="fr_400"></span>[2](#fn_400) for it had ceased from the mouths of all
the children of men from the day of the overthrow (of Babel). 26. And
I <span id="fr_401"></span>[3](#fn_401) opened his mouth, and his ears
and his lips, and I began to speak with him in Hebrew in the tongue of
the creation. 27. And he took the books of his fathers, and these were
written in Hebrew and he transcribed them, and he began from henceforth
to study them, and I made known to him that which he could not
(understand), and he studied them during the six rainy months. <span
id="fr_402"></span>[4](#fn_402) 28. And it came to pass in the seventh
year of the sixth week

that he spoke to his father, and informed him that he would leave Haran
to go into the land of Canaan to see it and return to him. 29. And Terah
his father said unto him; "Go in peace:

May the eternal God make thy path straight,  
And the Lord \[(be) with thee, and\] protect thee from all evil,  
And grant unto thee grace, mercy and favour before those who see thee,  
And may none of the children of men have power over thee to harm thee;  
Go in peace.

<span id="page_92">p. 92</span>

\[paragraph continues\] 30. And if thou seest a land pleasant to thy
eyes to dwell in, then arise and take me to thee and take Lot with thee,
the son of Haran thy brother, as thine own son: the Lord be with thee.
31. And Nahor thy brother leave with me till thou returnest in peace,
and we go with thee all together."
