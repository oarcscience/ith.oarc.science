### The Expulsion of Hagar and Ishmael (xvii. 1-14; cf. Gen. xxi. 8-21).

XVII\. And in the first year of the †fifth† <span
id="fr_495"></span>[1](#fn_495.md) week

|           |
|-----------|
| 1982 A.M. |

Isaac was weaned in this jubilee, and Abraham made a great banquet in
the third month, on the day his son Isaac was weaned. <span
id="fr_496"></span>[2](#fn_496.md) 2. And Ishmael, the son of Hagar, the
Egyptian, was before the face of Abraham, his father, in his place, and
Abraham rejoiced and blessed God because he had seen his sons 3 and had
not died childless. <span id="fr_497"></span>[3](#fn_497.md). And he
remembered the words which He had spoken to him on the day on which Lot
had parted from him, and he rejoiced because the Lord had given him seed
upon the earth to inherit the earth, and he blessed with all his mouth
the Creator of all things. <span id="fr_498"></span>[4](#fn_498.md)
4. <span id="fr_499"></span>[5](#fn_499.md) And Sarah saw Ishmael playing
and dancing <span id="fr_500"></span>[6](#fn_500.md) and Abraham rejoicing
with great joy, and she became jealous of Ishmael and said to Abraham,
"Cast out this bondwoman and her son; for the son of this bondwoman will
not be heir with my son, Isaac." 5. And the thing was grievous in
Abraham's sight, because of his maidservant and because of his son, that
he should drive them from him. 6. And God said to Abraham "Let it not be
grievous in thy sight, because of the child and because of the
bondwoman; in all that Sarah hath said unto thee, hearken to her words
and do (them); for in Isaac shall thy name and seed be called. 7. But as
for the son of this bondwoman I will make him a great <span
id="fr_501"></span>[7](#fn_501.md) nation, because he is of thy seed." 8.
And Abraham rose up early in the morning

<span id="page_108">p. 108</span>

and took bread and a bottle of water, and placed them on the shoulders
of Hagar and the child, and sent her away. 9. And she departed and
wandered in the wilderness of Beersheba, and the water in the bottle was
spent, and the child thirsted, and was not able to go on, and fell down.
10. And his mother took him and cast him under an olive tree, <span
id="fr_502"></span>[1](#fn_502.md) and went and sat her down over against
him, at the distance of a bow-shot; for she said, "Let me not see the
death of my child," and as she sat she wept. 11. And an angel of God,
one of the holy ones, said unto her, "Why weepest thou, Hagar? Arise,
take the child, and hold him in thine hand; for God hath heard thy
voice, and hath seen the child." 12. And she <span
id="fr_503"></span>[2](#fn_503.md) opened her eyes, and she saw a well of
water, and she went and filled her bottle with water, and she gave her
child to drink, and she arose and went towards the wilderness of Paran.
13. And the child grew and became an archer, and God was with him; and
his mother took him a wife from among the daughters of Egypt. 14. And
she bare him a son, and he called his name Nebaioth; <span
id="fr_504"></span>[3](#fn_504.md) for she said, "The Lord was nigh to me
when I called upon him."
