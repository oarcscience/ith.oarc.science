### The Children of Noah enter their Districts Canaan seizes Palestine wrongfully; Madai receives Media (x. 28-36)

28\. And Ham and his sons went into the land which he was to occupy,
which he acquired as his portion in the land of the south. <span
id="fr_366"></span>[1](#fn_366.md) 29. And Canaan saw the land of Lebanon
to the river of Egypt that it was very good, and he went not into the
land of his inheritance to the west (that is to) the sea, <span
id="fr_367"></span>[2](#fn_367.md) and he dwelt in the land of Lebanon,
eastward and westward from the border of Jordan and from the border of
the sea. <span id="fr_368"></span>[3](#fn_368.md) 30. And Ham, his father,
and Cush and Mizraim, his brothers, said unto him: "Thou hast settled in
a land which. is not thine, and which did not fall to us by lot: do not
do so; for if thou dost do so, thou and thy sons will fall in the land
and (be) accursed through sedition; for by sedition ye have settled, and
by sedition will thy children fall, and thou shalt be rooted out for
ever. 31. Dwell not in the dwelling of Shem; for to Shem and to his sons
did it come by their lot. 32. Cursed art thou, and cursed shalt thou be
beyond all the sons of Noah, by the curse <span
id="fr_369"></span>[4](#fn_369.md) by which we bound ourselves by an oath
in the presence of the holy judge, <span id="fr_370"></span>[5](#fn_370.md)
and in the presence of Noah our father." 33. But he did not hearken unto
them, and dwelt in the land of Lebanon from Hamath <span
id="fr_371"></span>[6](#fn_371.md) to the entering of Egypt, <span
id="fr_372"></span>[7](#fn_372.md) he and his sons until this day. 34. And
for this reason that land is named Canaan. 35. And Japheth and his sons
went towards the sea and dwelt in the land of their portion, and Madai
saw the land of the sea and it did not please him, and he begged a
(portion) from Elam and Asshur and Arpachshad,

his wife's brother, and he dwelt in the land of Media, near to his
wife's brother until this day. 36. And he called his dwelling-place, and
the dwelling-place of his sons, Media, after the name of their father
Madai.
