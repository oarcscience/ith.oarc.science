### The Tower of Babel and the Confusion of Tongues (x. 18-27; cf. Gen. xi. 1-9).

18\. And in the three and thirtieth jubilee, in the first year in the
second week, Peleg took to himself a wife, whose name was Lômnâ the
daughter of Sînâ’ar, and she bare him a son in the fourth year of this
week, and he called his name Reu; <span id="fr_357"></span>[2](#fn_357.md)
for he said: "Behold the children of men have become evil <span
id="fr_358"></span>[3](#fn_358.md) through the wicked purpose of building
for themselves a city and a tower in the land of Shinar." 19. For they
departed from the land of Ararat eastward to Shinar; for in his days
they built the city and the tower, saying, "Go to, let us ascend thereby
into heaven." <span id="fr_359"></span>[4](#fn_359.md) 20. And they began
to build, and in the fourth week they made brick with fire, and the
bricks served them for stone, and the clay <span
id="fr_360"></span>[5](#fn_360.md) with which they cemented them together
was asphalt which cometh out of the sea, and out of the fountains of
water in the land of Shinar. 21. And they built it: forty and three
years were they building it; its

breadth was 203 bricks, and the height (of a brick) was the third of
one; its height amounted to 5433 cubits and 2 palms, and (the extent of
one wall was) thirteen stades (and of the other thirty stades). 22. And
the Lord our God said unto us: "Behold, they are one people, and (this)
they begin to do, and now nothing will be withholden from them. Go to,
let us go down and confound their language, that they may not understand
one another's speech, <span id="fr_361"></span>[1](#fn_361.md) and they may
be dispersed into cities and nations, and one purpose will no longer
abide with them till the day of judgment." 23. And the Lord descended,
and we descended with Him to see the city and the tower which the
children of men had built. 24. And He confounded their language, and
they no longer understood one another's speech, and they ceased then to
build the city and the tower. 25. For this reason the whole land of
Shinar is called Babel, because the Lord did there confound all the
language of the children of men, and from thence they were
dispersed <span id="fr_362"></span>[2](#fn_362.md) into their cities, each
according to his language and his nation. <span
id="fr_363"></span>[3](#fn_363.md) 26. And the Lord sent a mighty
wind <span id="fr_364"></span>[4](#fn_364.md) against the tower and
overthrew it upon the earth, and behold it was between Asshur and
Babylon in the land of Shinar, and they called its name

"Overthrow." <span id="fr_365"></span>[5](#fn_365.md) 27. In the fourth
week in the first year in the beginning thereof in the four and
thirtieth jubilee, were they dispersed from the land of Shinar.
