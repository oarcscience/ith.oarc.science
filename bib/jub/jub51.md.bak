### The Messianic Woes (xxiii. 18-25). \[Eschatological partly.\]

18\. Behold the earth will be destroyed on account of all their works,
and there will be no seed of the vine, and no oil; for their works are
altogether faithless, and they will all perish together, beasts and
cattle and birds, and all the fish of the sea, <span
id="fr_621"></span>[1](#fn_619.md) on account of the children of men. 19.
And they will strive one with another, the young with the old, and the
old with the young, the poor with the rich, and the lowly with the
great, and the beggar with the prince, <span
id="fr_622"></span>[2](#fn_620.md) on account of the law and the
covenant; <span id="fr_623"></span>[3](#fn_621.md) for they have forgotten
commandment, and covenant, and feasts, and months, and Sabbaths, and
jubilees, and all judgments. 20. And they will stand (with bows and)
swords and war to turn them back into the way; <span
id="fr_624"></span>[4](#fn_622.md) but they will not return until much
blood hath been shed on the earth, one by another. <span
id="fr_625"></span>[5](#fn_623.md) 21. And those who have escaped will not
return from their wickedness to the way of righteousness, but they will
all exalt themselves to deceit and wealth, that they may each take all
that is his neighbour's, and they will name the great name, but not in
truth and not in righteousness, and they will defile the holy of holies
with their uncleanness and the corruption of their pollution. <span
id="fr_626"></span>[6](#fn_624.md) 22. And a great punishment will befall
the deeds of this generation

<span id="page_131">p. 131</span>

from the Lord, and He will give them over to the sword and to judgment
and to captivity, and to be plundered and devoured. 23. And He will wake
up against them the sinners of the Gentiles, who have neither mercy nor
compassion, and who will respect the person of none, neither old nor
young, nor any one, for they are more wicked and strong to do evil than
all the children of men.

And they will use violence against Israel and transgression against
Jacob,  
And much blood will be shed upon the earth,  
And there will be none to gather and none to bury. <span
id="fr_627"></span>[1](#fn_625.md)  
24. In those days they will cry aloud,  
And call and pray that they may be saved from the hand of the sinners,
the Gentiles; <span id="fr_628"></span>[2](#fn_626.md)  
But none will be saved.  
25. And the heads of the children will be white with grey hair, <span
id="fr_629"></span>[3](#fn_627.md)  
And a child of three weeks will appear old like a man of one hundred
years,  
And their stature will be destroyed by tribulation and oppression.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_619"></span>[130:1](jub51.htm#fr_621.md) Cf. 4 Ezra v. 7
(Ezek. xxxviii. 20).

<span id="fn_620"></span>[130:2](jub51.htm#fr_622.md) Internecine strife is
a standing feature in such eschatological passages; cf. 4 Ezra vi. 24;
Matt. xxiv. 10; *Ap. Bar.*, lxx. 3-4.

<span id="fn_621"></span>[130:3](jub51.htm#fr_623.md) Here the writer
passes to a description of what is happening in his own time.

<span id="fn_622"></span>[130:4](jub51.htm#fr_624.md) "Way" here = the true
path of religion; cf. Isa. xxx. 21 Acts ix. 2, etc.

<span id="fn_623"></span>[130:5](jub51.htm#fr_625.md) The conflicts between
the early Maccabeans (at the head of the national party in Judah) and
the Hellenizers seem to be referred to.

<span id="fn_624"></span>[130:6](jub51.htm#fr_626.md) Probably the
machinations of the Hellenizing party under the High Priest Alcimus are
referred to; cf. 1 Macc. ix. 54.

<span id="fn_625"></span>[131:1](jub51.htm#fr_627.md) The sufferings of the
nation up to (but not including) Simon's High Priesthood (142-135 B.C.)
may be referred to. For the last line cf. Jer. viii. 2.

<span id="fn_626"></span>[131:2](jub51.htm#fr_628.md) Cf. Gal. ii. 15.

<span id="fn_627"></span>[131:3](jub51.htm#fr_629.md) Cf. *Sibylline
Oracles*, ii. 155 ("children with grey hair on their temples born")--one
of the signs of the coming in of the Messianic age.
