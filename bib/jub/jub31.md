### Abram with Lot in Canaan and Egypt (cf. Gen. xii. 4-20). Abram separates from Lot (cf. Gen. xiii. 11-18) (xiii. 1-21).

XIII\. And Abram journeyed from Haran, and he took Sarai, his wife, and
Lot his brother Haran's son, to the land of Canaan, and he came into
†Asshur†, <span id="fr_403"></span>[1](#fn_403.md) and proceeded to
Shechem, and dwelt near a lofty oak. <span
id="fr_404"></span>[2](#fn_404.md) 2. And he saw, and, behold, the land was
very pleasant from the entering of Hamath to the lofty oak. <span
id="fr_405"></span>[3](#fn_405.md). And the Lord said to him: "To thee and
to thy seed will I give this land." 4. And he built an altar there, and
he offered thereon a burnt sacrifice to the Lord, who had appeared to
him. 5. And he removed from thence unto the mountain . . . 3 Bethel on
the west and Ai on the east, and pitched his tent there. <span
id="fr_406"></span>[4](#fn_406.md) 6. And he saw and behold, the land was
very wide and good, and everything grew thereon--vines and figs and
pomegranates, oaks and ilexes, and terebinths and oil trees, and cedars
and cypresses and date trees, and all trees of the field, and there was
water on the mountains. 7. And he blessed the Lord who had led him out
of Ur of the Chaldees, and had brought him to this land. 8. And it came

to pass in the first year, in the seventh week, on the new moon of the
first month, that he built an altar on this mountain, and called on the
name of the Lord: "Thou, the eternal God, art my God." <span
id="fr_407"></span>[5](#fn_407.md) 9. And he offered on the altar a burnt
sacrifice unto the Lord

<span id="page_93">p. 93</span>

that He should be with him and not forsake him all the days of his life.
10. And he removed from thence and went towards the south, <span
id="fr_408"></span>[1](#fn_408.md) and he came to Hebron, and Hebron was
built at, that time, and he dwelt there two years, and he went (thence)
into the land of the south, to Bealoth <span
id="fr_409"></span>[2](#fn_409.md) and there was a famine in the land. 11.
And Abram went into Egypt <span id="fr_410"></span>[3](#fn_410.md) in the
third

year of the week, and he dwelt in Egypt five years before his wife was
torn away from him. 12. NOW Tanais <span id="fr_411"></span>[4](#fn_411.md)
in Egypt was at that time built--seven years after Hebron. <span
id="fr_412"></span>[5](#fn_412.md) 11 And it came to pass when Pharaoh
seized Sarai, the wife of Abram, that the Lord plagued Pharaoh and his
house with great plagues because of Sarai, Abram's wife. 14. And Abram
was very glorious by reason of possessions in sheep, and cattle, and
asses, and horses, and camels, and menservants, and maidservants, and in
silver and gold exceedingly. And Lot also, his brother's son, was
wealthy. 15. And Pharaoh gave back Sarai, the wife of Abram, and he sent
him out of the land of Egypt, <span id="fr_413"></span>[6](#fn_413.md) and
he journeyed to the place where he had pitched his tent at the
beginning, to the place of the altar, with Ai on the east, and Bethel on
the west, and he blessed the Lord his God who had brought him back in
peace. <span id="fr_414"></span>[7](#fn_414.md) 16. And it came to pass in
the forty-first jubilee, in the third year of the

|           |
|-----------|
| 1963 A.M. |

first week, that he returned to this place and offered thereon a burnt
sacrifice, and called on the name of the Lord, and said: "Thou, the most
high God, art my God for ever and ever." <span
id="fr_415"></span>[8](#fn_415.md) 17. And in the fourth year

|           |

| 1964 A.M. |

of this week Lot parted from him, and Lot dwelt in Sodom, and the men of
Sodom were sinners exceedingly. <span id="fr_416"></span>[9](#fn_416.md)
18. And it grieved him in his heart that his brother's son had parted
from him; for he had no

<span id="page_94">p. 94</span>

children. 19. <span id="fr_417"></span>[1](#fn_417.md) In that year when
Lot was taken captive, the Lord said unto Abram, after that Lot had
parted from him, in the fourth year of this week: "Lift up thine eyes
from the place where thou art dwelling, northward and southward, and
westward and eastward. 20. For all the land which thou seest I shall
give to thee and to thy seed for ever, and I shall make thy seed as the
sand of the sea: <span id="fr_418"></span>[2](#fn_418.md) though a man may
number the dust of the earth, yet thy seed shall not be numbered. <span
id="fr_419"></span>[3](#fn_419) 21. Arise, walk (through the land.md) in
the length of it and the breadth of it, and see it all; for to thy seed
shall I give it." And Abram went to Hebron, and dwelt there.
