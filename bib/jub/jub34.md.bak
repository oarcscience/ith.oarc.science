### The Birth of Ishmael (xiv. 21-24; cf. Gen. xvi. 1-4. 11).

21\. And Abram rejoiced, and made all these things known to Sarai his
wife; and he believed that he would have seed, but she did not bear. 22.
And Sarai advised her husband Abram, and said unto him: "Go in unto
Hagar, my Egyptian maid: it may be that I shall build up seed unto thee
by her." 23. And Abram hearkened unto the voice of Sarai his wife, and
said unto her, "Do (so)." And Sarai took Hagar, her maid, the Egyptian,
and gave her to Abram, her husband, to be his wife. 24. And he went in
unto her, and she conceived and bare him a son, and he called his name
Ishmael, in the fifth year of this week; and this was the eighty-sixth
year in the life of Abram.
