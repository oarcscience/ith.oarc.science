### Judah's Incest with Tamar; his Repentance and Forgiveness (xli. 1-28; Cf. Gen. xxxviii.).

|           |

| 2165 A.M. |

XLI\. And in the forty-fifth jubilee, in the second week, (and) in the
second year, Judah took for his first-born Er, a wife from the daughters
of Aram, <span id="fr_855"></span>[4](#fn_847.md) named Tamar. 2. But he
hated, and did not lie with her, because his mother was of the daughters
of Canaan, and he wished to take him a wife of the kinsfolk of his
mother, but Judah, his father, would not permit him. 3. And this Er, the
first-born of

<span id="page_189">p. 189</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Judah, was wicked, and the Lord slew him. 4. And
Judah said unto Onan, his brother: "Go in unto thy brother's wife and
perform the duty of a husband's brother unto her, <span
id="fr_856"></span>[1](#fn_848.md) and raise up seed unto thy brother." 5.
And Onan knew that the seed would not be his, (but) his brother's only,
and he went into the house of his brother's wife, and spilt the seed on
the ground, and he was wicked in the eyes of the Lord, and He slew him.
6. And Judah said unto Tamar, his daughter-in-law: "Remain in thy
father's house as a widow till Shelah my son be grown up, and I shall
give thee to him to wife." 7. And he grew up; but Bêdsû’êl, <span
id="fr_857"></span>[2](#fn_849.md) the wife of Judah, did not permit her
son Shelah to marry. And Bêdsû’êl, the wife of Judah, died in the fifth
year of this week. 8. And

in the sixth year Judah went up to shear his sheep at

|           |
|-----------|
| 2169 A.M. |

Timnah. And they told Tamar: "Behold thy father-in-law goeth up to
Timnah to shear his sheep." 9. And she put off her widow's clothes, and
put on a veil, and adorned herself, and sat in the gate adjoining the
way to Timnah. 10. And as Judah was going along he found her, and
thought her to be an harlot, and he said unto her: "Let me come in unto
thee"; and she said unto him: "Come in," and he went in. 11. And she
said unto him: "Give me my hire"; and he said unto her: "I have nothing
in my hand save my ring that is on my finger, and my necklace, and my
staff which is in my hand." 12. And she said unto him: "Give them to me
until thou dost send me my hire"; and he said unto her: "I will send
unto thee a kid of the goats"; and he gave them to her, (and he went in
unto her,) and she conceived by him. 13. And Judah went unto his sheep,
and she went to her father's house. 14. And Judah sent a kid of the
goats by the hand of his shepherd, an Adullamite, and he found her not;
and he asked the people of the place, saying: "Where is the harlot who
was here?" And they said unto him: "There

<span id="page_190">p. 190</span>

is no harlot here with us." 15. And he returned and informed him, and
said unto him that he had not found her; "I asked the people of the
place, and they said unto me: 'There is no harlot here.'" And he said:
"Let her keep (them) lest we become a cause of derision." 16. And when
she had completed three months, it was manifest that she was with child,
and they told Judah, saying: "Behold Tamar, thy daughter-in-law, is with
child by whoredom." 17. And Judah went to the house of her father, and
said unto her father and her brothers: "Bring her forth, and let them
burn her, <span id="fr_858"></span>[1](#fn_850.md) for she hath wrought
uncleanness in Israel." 18. And it came to pass when they brought her
forth to bum her that she sent to her father-in-law the ring and the
necklace, and the staff, saying: "Discern whose are these, for by him am
I with child." 19. And Judah acknowledged, and said: "Tamar is more
righteous than I am. And therefore let them burn her not." 20. And for
that reason she was not given to Shelah, and he did not again approach
her. 21. And after that she bare

two sons, Perez and Zerah, in the seventh year of this second week. 22.
And thereupon the seven years of fruitfulness were accomplished, of
which Joseph spake to Pharaoh. <span id="fr_859"></span>[2](#fn_851.md) 23.
And Judah acknowledged that the deed which he had done was evil, for he
had lain with his daughter-in-law, and he esteemed it hateful in his
eyes, and he acknowledged that he had transgressed and gone astray; for
he had uncovered the skirt of his son, and he began to lament and to
supplicate before the Lord because of his transgression. 24. And we told
him in a dream that it was forgiven him because he supplicated
earnestly, and lamented, and did not again commit it. 25. And he
received forgiveness because he turned from his

<span id="page_191">p. 191</span>

sin and from his ignorance, for he transgressed greatly before our God;
and every one that acteth thus, every one who lieth with his
mother-in-law, let them burn him with fire that he may bum
therein, <span id="fr_860"></span>[1](#fn_852.md) for there is uncleanness
and pollution upon them; with fire let them bum them. 26. And do thou
command the children of Israel that there be no uncleanness amongst
them, for every one who lieth with his daughter-in-law <span
id="fr_861"></span>[2](#fn_853.md) or with his mother-in-law hath wrought
uncleanness; with fire let them bum the man who hath lain with her, and
likewise the woman, and He will turn away wrath and punishment from
Israel. 27. And unto Judah we said that his two sons had not lain with
her, and for this reason his seed was established for a second
generation, and would not be rooted out. 28. For in singleness of eye he
had gone and sought for punishment, namely, according to the judgment of
Abraham, <span id="fr_862"></span>[3](#fn_854.md) which he had commanded
his sons, Judah had sought to burn her with fire.

daughter of Dinah, who was brought up in the family of Potiphera (cf.
*Pirḳe de R. Eliezer* xxxviii.). The difficulty of Joseph's heathen
marriage is thus removed.
