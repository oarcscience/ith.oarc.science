### Abram's Knowledge of God and wonderful Deeds (xi. 16-24).

16\. And the child began to understand the errors of the earth that all
went astray after graven images and after uncleanness, and his father
taught him

writing, and he was two weeks of years old, and he separated himself
from his father <span id="fr_386"></span>[4](#fn_386.md) that he might not
worship idols with him. 17. And he began to pray to the Creator of all
things that He might save him from the errors of the children of men,
and that his portion should not fall into error after uncleanness and
vileness. 18. And the seed time came for the sowing of seed upon the
land, and they all went forth together to protect their seed against the
ravens, and Abram went forth with those that went, and the child was a
lad of fourteen years. 19. And a cloud of ravens came to devour the
seed, and Abram ran to meet them before they settled on the ground, and
cried to them before they settled on the ground to devour the seed, and
said, "Descend not: return to the place

<span id="page_87">p. 87</span>

whence ye came," and they proceeded to turn back. 20. And he caused the
clouds of ravens to turn back that day seventy times, and of all the
ravens throughout all the land where Abram was there settled there not
so much as one. 21. And all who were with him throughout all the land
saw him cry out, and all the ravens turn back, and his name became great
in all the land of the Chaldees. 22. And there came to him this year all
those that wished to sow, and he went with them until the time of sowing
ceased: and they sowed their land, and that year they brought enough
grain home and ate and were satisfied. 23. And in the first year of the
fifth week Abram taught

those who made implements for oxen, the artificers in wood, and they
made a vessel above the ground, facing the frame of the plough, <span
id="fr_387"></span>[1](#fn_387.md) in order to put the seed thereon, and
the seed fell down therefrom upon the share of the plough, and was
hidden in the earth, and they no longer feared the ravens. 24. And after
this manner they made (vessels) above the ground on all the frames of
the ploughs, and they sowed and tilled all the land, according as Abram
commanded them, and they no longer feared the birds.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_386"></span>[86:4](jub28.htm#fr_386.md) This is the theme of
much later Jewish legend. See especially the first part of the
*Apocalypse of Abraham*, an edition of which appears in this series. Cf.
xii. 1-14 below.

<span id="fn_387"></span>[87:1](jub28.htm#fr_387.md) An improved method of
sowing by means of a seed-scatterer attached to the plough (Arab. *bûk*)
is here described. This marked an advance on the primitive method of
scattering the seed by hand, and its invention is ascribed to Abraham.
In Rabbinical tradition Noah is the inventor of the plough and kindred
instruments. Cf. Krauss, *Talmudische Archäologie*, ii. 553 (note 151).
