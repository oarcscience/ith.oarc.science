### God's Covenant with Abram (xiv. 1-20; cf. Gen. xv.).

XIV. <span id="fr_428"></span>[4](#fn_428.md) After these things, in the
fourth year of this week, on the new moon of the third month, the word
of the Lord came to Abram in a dream, saying: "Fear not, Abram; I am thy
defender, and thy reward will be exceeding great." 2. And he said:
"Lord, Lord, what wilt thou give me, seeing I go

<span id="page_96">p. 96</span>

hence childless, and the son of Mâsêq, <span
id="fr_429"></span>[1](#fn_429.md) the son of my handmaid, is the Dammasek
Eliezer: he will be my heir, and to me thou hast given no seed." 3. And
He said unto him: "This (man) will not be thy heir, but one that will
come out of thine own bowels; he will be thine heir." 4. And He brought
him forth abroad, and said unto him: "Look toward heaven and number the
stars, if thou art able to number them." 5. And he looked toward heaven,
and beheld the stars. And He said unto him: "So shall thy seed be." 6.
And he believed in the Lord, and it was counted to him for
righteousness. 7. And He said unto him: "I am the Lord that brought thee
out of Ur of the Chaldees, to give thee the land of the Canaanites to
possess it for ever; and I shall be God unto thee and to thy seed after
thee." <span id="fr_430"></span>[2](#fn_430.md) 8. And he said: "Lord,
Lord, whereby shall I know that I shall inherit (it)?" 9. And he said
unto him: "Take Me an heifer of three years, and a goat of three years,
and a sheep of three years, and a turtle-dove, and a pigeon." <span
id="fr_431"></span>[3](#fn_431.md) 10. And he took all these in the middle
of the month; and he dwelt at the oak of Mamre, which is near
Hebron. <span id="fr_432"></span>[4](#fn_432.md) 11. And he built there an
altar, and sacrificed all these; and he poured their blood upon the
altar, and divided them in the midst, and laid them over against each
other; but the birds divided he not. 12. And birds came down upon the
pieces, and Abram drove them away, and did not suffer the birds to touch
them. <span id="fr_433"></span>[5](#fn_433.md) 13. And it came to pass,
when the sun had set, that an ecstasy fell upon Abram, and lo! an horror
of great darkness fell upon him, and it was said unto Abram: "Know of a
surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land (that is) not theirs,
and they will bring them into bondage, and afflict them four

<span id="page_97">p. 97</span>

hundred years. <span id="fr_434"></span>[1](#fn_434.md) 14. And the nation
also to whom they will be in bondage shall I judge, and after that they
will come forth thence with much substance. 15. And thou wilt go to thy
fathers in peace, and be buried in a good old age. 16. But in the fourth
generation <span id="fr_435"></span>[2](#fn_435.md) they will return
hither; for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full." <span
id="fr_436"></span>[3](#fn_436.md) 17. And he awoke from his sleep, and he
arose, and the sun had set; and there was a flame, and behold! a furnace
was smoking, and a flame of fire passed between the pieces. 18. And on
that day the Lord made a covenant with Abram, saying: "To thy seed will
I give this land, from the river of Egypt unto the great river, the
river Euphrates, the Kenites, the Kenizzites, the Kadmonites, the
Perizzites, and the Rephaim, the Phakorites, <span
id="fr_437"></span>[4](#fn_437.md) and the Hivites, <span
id="fr_438"></span>[5](#fn_438.md) and the Amorites, and the Canaanites,
and the Girgashites, and the Jebusites." <span
id="fr_439"></span>[6](#fn_439.md) 19. And the day passed, and Abram
offered the pieces, and the birds, and their fruit-offerings, and their
drink-offerings, and the fire devoured them. 20. And on that day <span
id="fr_440"></span>[7](#fn_440.md) we made a covenant with Abram, according
as we had covenanted with Noah in this month; <span
id="fr_441"></span>[8](#fn_441.md) and Abram renewed the festival and
ordinance for himself for ever.

<span id="fn_429"></span>[96:1](jub33.htm#fr_429.md) Wrongly taken as a
proper name (cf. RX.). So LXX.

<span id="fn_430"></span>[96:2](jub33.htm#fr_430.md) Cf. Gen. xv. 7.

<span id="fn_431"></span>[96:3](jub33.htm#fr_431.md) For 8-9 cf. Gen. xv.

10-11.

<span id="fn_434"></span>[97:1](jub33.htm#fr_434.md) Cf. Gen. xv. 13, but
Exod. xii. 40 gives the number 430. Tradition assumes that the number
includes the sojourn of the Patriarchs in Canaan. Our text reckons the
period from the birth of Isaac (when Abraham was 100 years old). St.
Paul (Gal. iii. 16-17) reckons 430 years from the announcement.
According to Targ. Ps.-Jon. on Exod. xii. 40 f., the odd 30 years cover
the period between the announcement and Isaac's birth.

<span id="fn_435"></span>[97:2](jub33.htm#fr_435.md) A generation = 100
years. Isaac was born when Abraham was 100 years old (Gen. xxi. 5).

<span id="fn_436"></span>[97:3](jub33.htm#fr_436.md) For 13-16 cf. Gen. xv.
12-16.

<span id="fn_437"></span>[97:4](jub33.htm#fr_437.md) Absent from NIT (which
inserts "Hittite" before "Perizite").

<span id="fn_438"></span>[97:5](jub33.htm#fr_438.md) So LXX and Sam. here
(Gen. XV. 20); but MT, Syr. and Vulg. omit.

<span id="fn_439"></span>[97:6](jub33.htm#fr_439.md) For 17-18 cf. Gen. xv.
17-21.

<span id="fn_440"></span>[97:7](jub33.htm#fr_440.md) *i. e.* the 15th of
Sivan.

<span id="fn_441"></span>[97:8](jub33.htm#fr_441.md) Probably, according to
our author, on the same day of the month.
