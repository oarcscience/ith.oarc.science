### The History of the Patriarchs from Reu to Abraham (cf. Gen. xi, 20-30); the Corruption of the Human Race (xi. 1-15).

XI\. And in the thirty-fifth jubilee, in the third week, in the first
year thereof, Reu took to himself a wife, and her name was ’Ôrâ, the
daughter of ’Ûr, the son of Kêsêd, and she bare him a son, and he

| 1687 A.M. |

called his name Sêrôḫ, <span id="fr_373"></span>[1](#fn_373) in the
seventh year of this week in this jubilee. 2. <span
id="fr_374"></span>[2](#fn_374) And the sons of Noah began to war on
each other, to take captive and to slay each other, and to shed the
blood of men on the earth, and to eat blood, and to build strong cities,
and walls, and towers, and individuals (began) to exalt themselves above
the nation, <span id="fr_375"></span>[3](#fn_375) and to found the
beginnings of kingdoms, and to go to war people against people, and
nation against nation, and city against city, and all (began) to do
evil, and to acquire arms, and to teach their sons war, and they began
to capture cities, and to sell male and female slaves. 3. And ’Ûr, the
son of Kêsêd, <span id="fr_376"></span>[4](#fn_376) built the city of
’Arâ <span id="fr_377"></span>[5](#fn_377) of the Chaldees, and called
its name after his own name and the name of his father. 4. And they made
for themselves molten images, and they worshipped each the idol, the
molten image which they had made for themselves, and they began to make
graven images and unclean simulacra, and malignant spirits assisted

<span id="page_85">p. 85</span>

and seduced (them) into committing transgression and uncleanness. 5. And
the prince Mastêmâ exerted himself to do all this, and he sent forth
other spirits, those which were put under his hand, to do all manner of
wrong and sin, and all manner of transgression, to corrupt and destroy,
and to shed blood upon the earth. <span id="fr_378"></span>[1](#fn_378)
6. For this reason he called the name of Sêrôḫ, Serug, for every one
turned to do all manner of sin and transgression. 7. And he grew up, and
dwelt in Ur of the Chaldees, near to the father of his wife's mother,
and he worshipped idols, and he took to himself a wife in the
thirty-sixth jubilee, in the

fifth week, in the first year thereof, and her name was Mêlkâ, <span
id="fr_379"></span>[2](#fn_379) the daughter of Kâbêr, the daughter of
his father's brother. 8. And she bare him Nahor, in the first year of
this week, and he grew and dwelt in Ur of the Chaldees, and his father
taught him the researches of the Chaldees to divine and augur, according
to the signs of heaven. 9. And in the thirty-seventh jubilee, in the
sixth week, in the first

|           |

| 1800 A M. |

year thereof, he took to himself a wife, and her name was ’Îjâskâ, <span
id="fr_380"></span>[3](#fn_380) the daughter of Nêstâg of the Chaldees.
10. And she bare him Terah <span id="fr_381"></span>[4](#fn_381) in the
seventh year

|           |
|-----------|
| 1806 A.M. |

of this week. 11. And the prince Mastêmâ sent ravens and birds to devour
the seed which was sown in the land, in order to destroy the land, and
rob the children of men of their labours. Before they could plough in
the seed, the ravens picked (it) from the surface of the ground. 12. And
for this reason he called his name Terah, because the ravens and the
birds reduced them to destitution and devoured their seed. <span
id="fr_382"></span>[5](#fn_382) 13. And the years began to be barren,
owing to the birds, and they devoured all the fruit of the

<span id="page_86">p. 86</span>

trees from the trees: it was only with great effort that they could save
a little of all the fruit of the

|           |

| 1870 A.M. |

earth in their days. 14. And in this thirty-ninth jubilee, in the second
week in the first year, Terah took to himself a wife, and her name was
’Êdnâ, <span id="fr_383"></span>[1](#fn_383) the daughter of
’Abrâm <span id="fr_384"></span>[2](#fn_384) the daughter of his
father's

|           |
|-----------|
| 1876 A.M. |

sister. 15. And in the seventh year of this week she bare him a son, and
he called his name Abram, by the name of the father of his mother; for
he had died before his daughter had conceived a son. <span

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_373"></span>[84:1](jub27.htm#fr_373) Cf. Gen. xi. 20 f.
(MT. has *Serug* for *Sêrôḫ*).

<span id="fn_374"></span>[84:2](jub27.htm#fr_374) In 2-6 the corruption
of mankind is ascribed to the period of Serug.

<span id="fn_375"></span>[84:3](jub27.htm#fr_375) A note of hostility to
monarchy.

<span id="fn_376"></span>[84:4](jub27.htm#fr_376) The place name *Ur
Kasdîm* ("Ur of the Chaldees") is here transformed into the names of two
persons, after whom the city is named.

<span id="fn_377"></span>[84:5](jub27.htm#fr_377) *i. e.* Ur.

<span id="fn_378"></span>[85:1](jub27.htm#fr_378) Cf. 1 Enoch xvi.

<span id="fn_379"></span>[85:2](jub27.htm#fr_379) In Gen. xi. 29 Milcah
is the name of the wife of Nahor, Abram's brother.

<span id="fn_380"></span>[85:3](jub27.htm#fr_380) = Iscah (cf. Gen. xi.
29; but there she is daughter of Haran).

<span id="fn_381"></span>[85:4](jub27.htm#fr_381) Cf. Gen. xi. 24.

<span id="fn_382"></span>[85:5](jub27.htm#fr_382) Apparently some play
on the name Terah is involved in the original Hebrew; but the
explanation is uncertain.

<span id="fn_383"></span>[86:1](jub27.htm#fr_383) According to the
Talmud (*Baba bathra* 91*a*) her name was Amthelai, daughter of Karnebo.

<span id="fn_384"></span>[86:2](jub27.htm#fr_384) *i. e.* the
grandfather of the Biblical Abram.

<span id="fn_385"></span>[86:3](jub27.htm#fr_385) it was customary to
name a child after a grandfather. Here the child's name apparently
perpetuates the memory of a grandfather who had died before the child
was conceived.
