### Dinah ravished. Slaughter of the Shechemites. Laws against Intermarriage between Israel and the Heathen. The Choice of Levi (xxx. 1-26; cf. Gen. xxxiv.).

XXX\. And in the first year of the sixth week he

went up to Salem, to the east of Shechem, in peace, <span
id="fr_705"></span>[2](#fn_703.md) in the fourth month. 2. And there they
carried off Dinah, the daughter of Jacob, into the house of Shechem, the
son of Hamor, the Hivite, the prince of the land, and he lay with her
and defiled her, and she was a little girl, a child of twelve years. 3.
And he besought his father and her brothers that she might be given to
him to wife. And Jacob and his sons were wroth because of the men of
Shechem; <span id="fr_706"></span>[3](#fn_704.md)

<span id="page_154">p. 154</span>

for they had defiled Dinah, their sister, and they spake to them with
evil intent and dealt deceitfully with them and beguiled them. 4. And
Simeon and Levi came unexpectedly to Shechem and executed judgment on
all the men of Shechem, and slew all the men whom they found in it, and
left not a single one remaining in it: they slew all in torments because
they had dishonoured their sister Dinah. 5. And thus let it not again be
done from henceforth that a daughter of Israel be defiled; for judgment
is ordained in heaven against them that they should destroy with the
sword all the men of the Shechemites because they had wrought shame in
Israel. 6. And the Lord delivered them into the hands of the sons of
Jacob that they might exterminate them with the sword and execute
judgment upon them, and that it might not thus again be done in Israel
that a virgin of Israel should be defiled. 7. And if there is any man
who wisheth in Israel to give his daughter or his sister to any man who
is of the seed of the Gentiles he shall surely die, and they shall stone
him with stones; for he hath wrought shame in Israel; and they shall
burn the woman with fire, because she hath dishonoured the name of the
house of her father, and she shall be rooted out of Israel. <span
id="fr_707"></span>[1](#fn_705.md) 8. And let not an adulteress and no
uncleanness be found in Israel throughout all the days of the
generations of the earth; for Israel is holy unto the Lord, and every
man who hath defiled (it) shall surely die: they shall stone him with
stones. 9. For thus hath it been ordained and written in the heavenly
tables regarding all the seed of Israel: he who defileth (it) shall
surely die, and he shall be stoned with stones. 10. And to this law
there is no limit of days, and no remission, nor any atonement: but the
man who hath defiled his daughter shall be rooted out in the midst of
all Israel, because he hath

<span id="page_155">p. 155</span>

given of his seed to Moloch, <span id="fr_708"></span>[1](#fn_706.md) and
wrought impiously so as to defile it. 11. And do thou, Moses, command
the children of Israel and exhort them not to give their daughters to
the Gentiles, and not to take for their sons any of the daughters of the
Gentiles, for this is abominable before the Lord. 12. For this reason I
have written for thee in the words of the Law all the deeds of the
Shechemites, which they wrought against Dinah, and how the sons of Jacob
spake, saying: "We shall not give our daughter to a man who is
uncircumcised; for that were a reproach unto us." 13. And it is a
reproach to Israel, to those who give, and to those who take the
daughters of the Gentiles; for this is unclean and abominable to Israel.
14. <span id="fr_709"></span>[2](#fn_707.md) And Israel will not be free
from this uncleanness if it hath a wife of the daughters of the
Gentiles, or hath given any of its daughters to a man who is of any of
the Gentiles. 15. For there will be plague upon plague, and curse upon
curse, and every judgment and plague and curse will come (upon him): if
he do this thing, or hide his eyes from <span
id="fr_710"></span>[3](#fn_708.md) those who commit uncleanness, or those
who defile the sanctuary of the Lord, or those who profane His holy
name, <span id="fr_711"></span>[4](#fn_709) (then.md) will the whole
nation <span id="fr_712"></span>[5](#fn_710.md) together be judged for all
the uncleanness and profanation of this (man). 16. And there will be no
respect of persons \[and no consideration of persons\], <span
id="fr_713"></span>[6](#fn_711.md) and no receiving at his hands of fruits
and offerings and burnt-offerings and fat, nor the fragrance of sweet
savour, so as to accept it: and so fare every man or woman in Israel who
defileth the sanctuary. 17. For

<span id="page_156">p. 156</span>

this reason I have commanded thee, saying: "Testify this testimony to
Israel: see how the Shechemites fared and their sons: how they were
delivered into the hands of two sons of Jacob, and they slew them under
tortures, and it was (reckoned) unto them for righteousness, and it is
written down to them for righteousness. 18. And the seed of Levi was
chosen for the priesthood, and to be Levites, that they might minister
before the Lord, as we, continually, and that Levi and his sons may be
blessed for ever; for he was zealous to execute righteousness and
judgment and vengeance on all those who arose against Israel. <span
id="fr_714"></span>[1](#fn_712.md) 19. And so they inscribe as a testimony
in his favour on the heavenly tables blessing and righteousness before
the God of all: 20. And we remember the righteousness which the man
fulfilled during his life, at all periods of the year; until a thousand
generations they will record it, and it will come to him and to his
descendants after him, and he hath been recorded on the heavenly tables
as a friend <span id="fr_715"></span>[2](#fn_713.md) and a righteous man.
21. All this account I have written for thee, and have commanded thee to
say to the children of Israel, that they should not commit sin nor
transgress the ordinances nor break the covenant which hath been
ordained for them, (but) that they should fulfil it and be recorded as
friends. <span id="fr_716"></span>[2](#fn_713.md) 22. But if they
transgress and work uncleanness in every way, they will be recorded on
the heavenly tables as adversaries, and they will be destroyed out of
the book of life, <span id="fr_717"></span>[3](#fn_714.md) and they will be
recorded in the book of those who will be destroyed and with those who
will be rooted out of the earth. 23. And on the

<span id="page_157">p. 157</span>

day when the sons of Jacob slew Shechem a writing was recorded in their
favour in heaven that they had executed righteousness and uprightness
and vengeance on the sinners, and it was written for a blessing. 24. And
they brought Dinah, their sister, out of the house of Shechem, and they
took captive everything that was in Shechem, their sheep and their oxen
and their asses, and all their wealth, and all their flocks, and brought
them all to Jacob their father. 25. And he reproached them because they
had put the city to the sword; <span id="fr_718"></span>[1](#fn_715.md) for
he feared those who dwelt in the land, the Canaanites and the
Perizzites. 26. And the dread of the Lord was upon all the cities which
are around about Shechem, and they did not rise to pursue after the sons
of Jacob; for terror had fallen upon them. <span

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_703"></span>[153:2](jub62.htm#fr_705.md) Based upon xxxiii. 18
(cf. R.V. marg.). Our text combines two readings ("Shalem," the name of
a city, and shālōm, "peace").

<span id="fn_704"></span>[153:3](jub62.htm#fr_706.md) Our author omits all
reference to the circumcision of the Shechemites, because he approves of
the conduct of Simeon and Levi, and extols it. On the other hand, their
conduct in the matter is severely reprobated in Gen. xlix. 5-7. Our
author's view seems to reflect a bitter feeling against the people of
Shechem. which prevailed in his time.

<span id="fn_705"></span>[154:1](jub62.htm#fr_707.md) Notice the passionate
denunciation of mixed marriages. The burning of the woman with fire,
according to the Mosaic Law (Lev. xxi. 9), was reserved for the priest's
daughter who played the harlot.

<span id="fn_706"></span>[155:1](jub62.htm#fr_708.md) Cf. Lev. xviii. 21:
here the prohibition in Lev. against making "any of thy seed pass
through the fire to Molech" is interpreted as = to give one's child in
marriage to a Gentile; so, also, Targ. Ps.-Jonathan on this verse. In
later times the rule has not always been strictly enjoined.

<span id="fn_707"></span>[155:2](jub62.htm#fr_709.md) 14-15 are based upon
Lev. xx. 2-4.

<span id="fn_708"></span>[155:3](jub62.htm#fr_710.md) *i. e.* "ignore"; cf.
Lev. xx. 4.

<span id="fn_709"></span>[155:4](jub62.htm#fr_711.md) Cf. Lev. xx. 3.

<span id="fn_710"></span>[155:5](jub62.htm#fr_712.md) In Lev. xx. 5, only
the guilty man's family is involved.

<span id="fn_711"></span>[155:6](jub62.htm#fr_713.md) Bracketed as a
dittograph.

<span id="fn_712"></span>[156:1](jub62.htm#fr_714.md) A different reason
for Levi's choice for the priesthood is given in xxxii. 3; cf. also
*Test. Levi* iv. 2.

<span id="fn_713"></span>[156:2](jub62.htm#fr_716.md) *sc.* of God.

<span id="fn_714"></span>[156:3](jub62.htm#fr_717.md) This expression,
derived from the O.T. (cf. Ps. lxix. 28; Exod. xxxii. 32) had reference
originally to the temporal blessings of the theocracy, and this may be
its meaning here; but later the meaning was extended to eternal life. It
occurs frequently in the N.T. (cf. Rev. iii. 5, xiii. 8, etc.); cf. also
1 Enoch xlvii. 3.

<span id="fn_715"></span>[157:1](jub62.htm#fr_718.md) Cf. *Test. Levi* vi.

<span id="fn_716"></span>[157:2](jub62.htm#fr_719.md) Cf. Gen. xxxv. 5.
