### The Birth and Early Years of Moses (xlvii. 1-12; cf. Exod. ii.).

XLVII\. And in the seventh week, in the seventh

year, in the forty-seventh jubilee, thy father <span
id="fr_900"></span>[3](#fn_892) went forth from the land of Canaan, and
thou wast born in the fourth week, in the sixth year thereof, in the

forty-eighth jubilee; this was the time of tribulation on the children
of Israel. 2. And Pharaoh, king of Egypt, issued a command regarding
them that they

<span id="page_204">p. 204</span>

should cast all their male children which were born into the river. 3.
And they cast them in for seven months until the day that thou wast
born. And thy mother hid thee for three months, and they told regarding
her. 4. And she made an ark for thee, and covered it with pitch and
asphalt, and placed it in the flags on the bank of the river, and she
placed thee in it seven days, and thy mother came by night and suckled
thee, and by day Miriam, thy sister, guarded thee from the birds. 5. And
in those days Tharmuth, <span id="fr_901"></span>[1](#fn_893) the
daughter of Pharaoh, came to bathe in the river, and she heard thy voice
crying, and she told her maidens to bring thee forth, and they brought
thee unto her. 6. And she took thee out of the ark, and she had
compassion on thee. 7. And thy sister said unto her: "Shall I go and
call unto thee one of the Hebrew women to nurse and suckle this babe for
thee?" And she said (unto her): "Go." 8. And she went and called thy
mother Jochebed, <span id="fr_902"></span>[2](#fn_894) and she gave her
wages, and she nursed thee. 9. And afterwards, when thou wast grown up,
they brought thee unto the daughter of Pharaoh, and thou didst become
her son, and Amram thy father taught thee writing, <span
id="fr_903"></span>[3](#fn_895) and after thou hadst completed three
weeks they brought thee into the royal court. 10. And thou

| 2351-2372 A.M. |

wast three weeks of years at court until the time when thou didst go
forth from the royal court and didst see an Egyptian smiting thy friend
who was of the children of Israel, and thou didst slay him and hide him
in the sand. 11. And on the second day thou didst find two of the
children of Israel striving together, and thou didst say to him who was
doing the wrong: "Why dost thou smite thy brother? 12. And he was angry
and indignant, and said "Who made thee a prince and a judge over us?
Thinkest thou to kill me as thou killedst the Egyptian yesterday?" And
thou didst fear and flee on account of these words.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_890"></span>[203:1](jub83.htm#fr_898) This interesting
statement apparently implies that some of the Hebrew tribes were already
in Canaan before the Exodus. Or is it a reminiscence of the fact that
the tribe of Judah absorbed some South Canaanitish tribes which were
never in Egypt? Cf. Burney in *Journal of Theological Studies*, 1908,
pp. 321-352.

<span id="fn_891"></span>[203:2](jub83.htm#fr_899) So LXX (Exod. i. ii);
MT =? "store cities."

<span id="fn_892"></span>[203:3](jub84.htm#fr_900) *i. e.* Moses'
father, Amram.

<span id="fn_893"></span>[204:1](jub84.htm#fr_901) Thermuthis (Josephus,
*Ant.* ii. 9, 5, 7).

<span id="fn_894"></span>[204:2](jub84.htm#fr_902) Cf. Exod. vi. 20;
Num. xxvi. 59.

<span id="fn_895"></span>[204:3](jub84.htm#fr_903) Contrast Acts vii.
22.
