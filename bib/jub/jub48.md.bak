### Abraham's Last Words to and Blessings of Jacob (xxii. 10-30).

10\. And he called Jacob and said My son Jacob, may the God of all <span
id="fr_581"></span>[4](#fn_579.md) bless thee and strengthen thee to do
righteousness, and His will before Him, and may He choose thee and thy
seed that ye may become a people for His inheritance according to His
will alway. And do thou, my son, Jacob, draw near and kiss me." 11. And
he drew near and kissed him, and he said:

"Blessed be my son Jacob  
And all the sons of God Most High, unto all the ages:  
May God give unto thee a seed of righteousness;  
And some of thy sons may He sanctify in the midst of the whole earth;  
May nations serve thee,

 

<span id="page_124">p. 124</span>

And all the nations bow themselves before thy seed. <span
id="fr_582"></span>[1](#fn_580.md)  
12. Be strong in the presence of men,  
And exercise authority over all the seed of Seth. <span
id="fr_583"></span>[2](#fn_581.md)  
Then thy ways and the ways of thy sons will be justified,  
So that they shall become a holy nation.  
13. May the Most High God give thee all the blessings  
Wherewith he hath blessed me  
And wherewith He blessed Noah and Adam; <span
id="fr_584"></span>[3](#fn_582.md)  
May they rest on the sacred head of thy seed from generation to
generation for ever.  
14. And may He cleanse thee from all unrighteousness and impurity,  
That thou mayest be forgiven all (thy) transgressions; (and) thy sins of
ignorance.  
And may He strengthen thee,  
And bless thee.  
And mayest thou inherit the whole earth,  
15. And may He renew His covenant with thee,  
That thou mayest be to Him a nation for His inheritance <span
id="fr_585"></span>[4](#fn_583.md) for all the ages,  
And that He may be to thee and to thy seed a God in truth and
righteousness throughout all the days of the earth.  
16. And do thou, my son Jacob, remember my words,  
And observe the commandments of Abraham, thy father:  
Separate thyself from the nations,  
And eat not with them: <span id="fr_586"></span>[5](#fn_584.md)  
And do not according to their works,  
And become not their associate;  
For their works are unclean,

 

<span id="page_125">p. 125</span>

And all their ways are a pollution and an abomination and uncleanness.  
17. They offer their sacrifices to the dead <span
id="fr_587"></span>[1](#fn_585.md)  
And they worship evil spirits, <span id="fr_588"></span>[2](#fn_586.md)  
And they eat over the graves, <span id="fr_589"></span>[3](#fn_587.md)  
And all their works are vanity and nothingness.  
18. They have no heart to understand  
And their eyes do not see what their works are,  
And how they err in saying to a piece of wood: 'Thou art my God,'  
And to a stone: 'Thou art my Lord and thou art my deliverer.' <span
id="fr_590"></span>[4](#fn_588.md)  
\[And they have no heart.\] <span id="fr_591"></span>[5](#fn_589.md)  
19. And as for thee, my son Jacob,  
May the Most High God help thee  
And the God of heaven bless thee  
And remove thee from their uncleanness and from all their error.  
20. Be thou ware, my son Jacob, of taking a wife from any seed of the
daughters of Canaan;  
For all his seed is to be rooted out of the earth. <span
id="fr_592"></span>[6](#fn_590.md)  
21, For, owing to the transgression of Ham, <span
id="fr_593"></span>[7](#fn_591.md) Canaan erred, <span
id="fr_594"></span>[8](#fn_592.md)  
And all his seed will be destroyed from off the earth and all the
residue thereof,  
And none springing from him will be saved on the day of judgment.  
22. And as for all the worshippers of idols and the profane  
 <span id="fr_595"></span>[9](#fn_593)(*b*.md) There will be no hope for
them in the land of the living;

 

<span id="page_126">p. 126</span>

(*e*) And there will be no remembrance of them on the earth;  
(*c*) For they will descend into Sheol,  
(*d*) And into the place of condemnation will they go, <span
id="fr_596"></span>[1](#fn_594.md)  
As the children of Sodom were taken away from the earth  
So will all those who worship idols be taken away.  
23. Fear not, my son Jacob,  
And be not dismayed, O son of Abraham:  
May the Most High God preserve thee from destruction,  
And from all the paths of error may He deliver thee.

\[paragraph continues\] 24. This house have I built for myself that I
might put my name upon it in the earth: \[it is given to thee and to thy
seed for ever\], <span id="fr_597"></span>[2](#fn_595.md) and it will be
named the house of Abraham; it is given to thee and to thy seed for
ever; for thou wilt build my house <span id="fr_598"></span>[3](#fn_596.md)
and establish my name before God for ever: thy seed and thy name will
stand throughout all generations of the earth."

25\. And he ceased commanding <span id="fr_599"></span>[4](#fn_597.md) him
and blessing him. 26: And the two lay together on one bed, and Jacob
slept in the bosom of Abraham, his father's father and he kissed him
seven times, and his affection and his heart rejoiced over him.
27. <span id="fr_600"></span>[5](#fn_598.md) And he blessed him with all
his heart and said: "The Most High God, the God of all, and Creator of
all, who brought me forth from Ur of the Chaldees, that He might give me
this land to inherit <span id="fr_601"></span>[6](#fn_599.md) it for ever,
and that I might establish a holy seed--blessed be the Most High for
ever." 28. And he blessed Jacob and said: "My son, over whom with all my
heart and my affection I rejoice, may Thy grace and Thy mercy

<span id="page_127">p. 127</span>

be lift up <span id="fr_602"></span>[1](#fn_600.md) upon him and upon his
seed alway. 29. And do not forsake him, nor set him at nought from
henceforth unto the days of eternity, and may Thine eyes be opened upon
him and upon his seed, <span id="fr_603"></span>[2](#fn_601.md) that Thou
mayest preserve him, and bless him, and mayest sanctify him as a nation
for Thine inheritance; 30. And bless him with all Thy blessings from
henceforth unto all the days of eternity, and renew Thy covenant and Thy
grace with him and with his seed according to all Thy good pleasure unto
all the generations of the earth."
