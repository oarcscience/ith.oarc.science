### Esau and his Sons wage War with Jacob (xxxvii. 1-25).

XXXVII. <span id="fr_814"></span>[1](#fn_806.md) And on the day that Isaac
the father

of Jacob and Esau died, the sons of Esau heard that Isaac had given the
portion of the elder to his younger son Jacob and they were very angry.
2. And they strove with their father, saying: "Why hath thy father given
Jacob the portion of the elder and passed over thee, although thou art
the elder and Jacob the younger?" 3. And he said unto them "Because I
sold my birthright to Jacob for a small mess of lentils; and on the day
my father sent me to hunt and catch and bring him something that he
should eat and bless me, he came with guile and brought my father food
and drink, and my father blessed him and put me under his hand. 4. And
now our father hath caused us to swear, me and him, that we shall not
mutually devise evil, either against his brother, and that we shall
continue in love and in peace each with his brother and not make our
ways corrupt." <span id="fr_815"></span>[2](#fn_807.md) 5. And they said
unto him, "We shall not hearken unto thee to make peace with him; for
our strength is greater than his strength, and we are more powerful than
he; we shall go against him and slay him, and destroy him and his sons.
And if thou wilt not go with us, we shall do hurt to thee also. 6. And
now hearken unto us: Let us send to Aram <span
id="fr_816"></span>[3](#fn_808.md) and Philistia <span
id="fr_817"></span>[4](#fn_809.md) and Moab

<span id="page_180">p. 180</span>

and Ammon, <span id="fr_818"></span>[1](#fn_810.md) and let us choose for
ourselves chosen men who are ardent for battle, and let us go against
him and do battle with him, and let us exterminate him from the earth
before he groweth strong." 7. And their father said unto them, "Do not
go and do not make war with him lest ye fall before him." 8. And they
said unto him, "This too, is exactly thy mode of action from thy youth
until this day, and thou art putting thy neck under his yoke. We shall
not hearken to these words." 9. And they sent to Aram, and to
’Adurâm <span id="fr_819"></span>[2](#fn_811.md) to the friend of their
father, and they hired along with them one thousand fighting men, chosen
men of war. 10. And there came to them from Moab and from the children
of Ammon, those who were hired, one thousand chosen men, and from
Philistia, one thousand chosen men of war, and from Edom <span
id="fr_820"></span>[3](#fn_812.md) and from the Horites one thousand chosen
fighting men, and from the Kittim <span id="fr_821"></span>[4](#fn_813.md)
mighty men of war. 11. And they said unto their father: "Go forth with
them and lead them, else we shall slay thee." 12. And he was filled with
wrath and indignation on seeing that his sons were forcing him to go
before (them) to lead them against Jacob his brother. 13. But afterward
he remembered all the evil which lay hidden in his heart against Jacob
his brother; and he remembered not the oath which he had sworn to his
father and to his mother that he would devise no evil all his days
against Jacob his brother. 14. And notwithstanding all this, Jacob knew
not that they were coming against him to battle, and he was mourning for
Leah, his wife, until they approached very near to the tower with four
thousand warriors and chosen men of war. 15. And the men of Hebron sent
to him saying, "Behold thy brother hath come against thee, to fight
thee, with four thousand girt with the sword, and they carry shields and
weapons"; for they loved Jacob more than Esau. So they told him; for
Jacob was a more liberal and merciful man

<span id="page_181">p. 181</span>

than Esau. 16. But Jacob would not believe until they came very near to
the tower. 17. And he closed the gates of the tower; and he stood on the
battlements and spake to his brother Esau and said, "Noble is the
comfort wherewith thou hast come to comfort me for my wife who hath
died. Is this the oath that thou didst swear to thy father and again to
thy mother before they died? Thou hast broken the oath, and on the
moment that thou didst swear to thy father wast thou condemned." 18. And
then Esau answered and said unto him, "Neither the children of men nor
the beasts of the earth have any oath of righteousness which in swearing
they have sworn (an oath valid) for ever; but every day they devise evil
one against another, and how each may slay his adversary and foe. 19.
And thou dost hate me and my children for ever. And there is no
observing the tie of brotherhood with thee. 20. Hear these words which I
declare unto thee,

If the boar can change its skin and make its bristles as soft as wool,  
Or if it can cause horns to sprout forth on its head like the horns of a
stag or of a sheep,  
Then shall I observe the tie of brotherhood with thee. <span
id="fr_822"></span>[1](#fn_814.md)  
\[And if the breasts separated themselves from their mother; for thou
hast not been a brother to me.\] <span id="fr_823"></span>[2](#fn_815.md)  
21. And if the wolves make peace with the lambs so as not to devour or
do them violence,  
And if their hearts are towards them for good,  
Then there will be peace in my heart towards thee.  
22. And if the lion becometh the friend of the ox and maketh peace with
him, <span id="page_182">p. 182</span>  
And if he is bound under one yoke with him and plougheth with him,  
Then shall I make peace with thee.  
23. And when the raven becometh white as the râzâ, <span
id="fr_824"></span>[1](#fn_816.md)  
Then know that -I have loved thee  
And shall make peace with thee.  
Thou shalt be rooted out,  
And thy sons shall be rooted out,  
And there shall be no peace for thee."

\[paragraph continues\] 24. And when Jacob saw that he was (so) evilly
disposed towards him with his heart, and with all his soul as to slay
him, and that he had come springing like the wild boar which cometh upon
the spear that pierceth and killeth it, and recoileth not from it; 25.
Then he spake to his own and to his servants that they should attack him
and all his companions.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_806"></span>[179:1](jub72.htm#fr_814.md) The legend of the
wars between the sons of Jacob and Esau contained in chaps.
xxxvii-xxxviii. here seems to be ancient. It is also found in *Test.
Judah* ix. and in the Jewish Midrashic literature. Our text contains the
oldest form.

<span id="fn_807"></span>[179:2](jub72.htm#fr_815.md) This representation
gives a favourable view of Esau's own attitude. In the later form of the
legend (in the *Yalḳut*) this is altered to Esau's disadvantage.

<span id="fn_808"></span>[179:3](jub72.htm#fr_816.md) The peoples mentioned
here and in the context nearly all played a prominent part in the
campaigns of the Maccabees. "Aram," *i. e.* Syria, was, of course, the
suzerain power in their day, who sought to oppress the Jews, and whose
yoke was ultimately entirely thrown off.

<span id="fn_809"></span>[179:4](jub72.htm#fr_817) Cf. xxiv. 28 (note.md).

<span id="fn_810"></span>[180:1](jub72.htm#fr_818.md) Cf. 1 Macc. v. 6-8.

<span id="fn_811"></span>[180:2](jub72.htm#fr_819.md) An Aramaean; cf.
xxxviii. 3.

<span id="fn_812"></span>[180:3](jub72.htm#fr_820.md) Cf. 1 Macc. v. 3, 65
(also iv. 29, 61).

<span id="fn_813"></span>[180:4](jub72.htm#fr_821.md) Cf. xxiv. 28.

<span id="fn_814"></span>[181:1](jub72.htm#fr_822.md) For the construction
of such sayings cf. the rebuke administered to Aḳiba (when the latter
recognized Bar-Kokba as the Messiah) by Jochanan ben Torta: "Sooner
shall grass grow from thy beard, Aḳiba, than that Messiah should
appear." The "boar" may symbolize Esau.

<span id="fn_815"></span>[181:2](jub72.htm#fr_823.md) Charles thinks the
bracketed words may be out of place or corrupt.

<span id="fn_816"></span>[182:1](jub72.htm#fr_824.md) "A large white bird
which eats grasshoppers" (Isenberg, quoted by Charles).
