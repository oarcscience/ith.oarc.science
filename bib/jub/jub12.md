### God's Revelation to Moses on Mount Sinai

(i. 1-26: cf. Ex. xxiv. 15-18).

1\. And it came to pass in the first year of the

exodus of the children of Israel out of Egypt, in the third month, <span
id="fr_34"></span>[5](#fn_34) on the sixteenth day of the month, that
God spake to Moses, saying: "Come up to Me on the Mount, and I will give
thee two tables of stone of the law and of the commandment, which I have
written, that thou mayst teach them." <span
id="fr_35"></span>[6](#fn_35) 2. And Moses went up into the mount of
God, and the glory of the Lord abode on Mount Sinai, and a cloud
overshadowed it six days. 3. And He called to Moses on

<span id="page_36">p. 36</span>

the seventh day out of the midst of the cloud, and the appearance of the
glory of the Lord was like a flaming fire on the top of the Mount. 4.
And Moses was on the Mount forty days and forty nights, and God taught
him the earlier and the later history <span
id="fr_36"></span>[1](#fn_36) of the division of all the days of the law
and of the testimony. 5. And He said: "Incline thine heart to every word
which I shall speak to thee on this Mount, and write them <span
id="fr_37"></span>[2](#fn_37) in a book in order that their generations
may see how I have not forsaken them for all the evil which they have
wrought in transgressing the covenant which I establish between Me and
thee for their generations this day on Mount Sinai. 6. And thus it will
come to pass when all these things come upon them, <span
id="fr_38"></span>[3](#fn_38) that they will recognize that I am more
righteous than they in all their judgments and in all their actions, and
they will recognize that I have been truly with them. 7. And do thou
write for thyself <span id="fr_39"></span>[4](#fn_39) all these words
which I declare unto thee this day, for I know their rebellion and their
stiff neck, <span id="fr_40"></span>[5](#fn_40) before I bring them into
the land of which I sware to their fathers, to Abraham and to Isaac and
to Jacob, saying: "Unto your seed will I give a land flowing with milk
and honey. 8. And they will eat and be satisfied, and they will turn to
strange gods, to (gods) which cannot deliver them from aught of their
tribulation: "and this witness shall be heard for a witness against
them. <span id="fr_41"></span>[6](#fn_41) 9. For they will forget all My
commandments, (even) all that I command them, and they will walk after
the Gentiles, and after their uncleanness, and after their shame, and
will serve their gods, and these will prove unto them an offence and a
tribulation and an affliction and a snare. <span
id="fr_42"></span>[7](#fn_42) 10. And

<span id="page_37">p. 37</span>

many will perish and they will be taken captive, <span
id="fr_43"></span>[1](#fn_43) and will fall into the hands of the enemy,
because they have forsaken My ordinances and My commandments, and the
festivals of My covenant, and My sabbaths, and My holy place <span
id="fr_44"></span>[2](#fn_44) which I have hallowed for Myself in their
midst, and My tabernacle, <span id="fr_45"></span>[3](#fn_45) and My
sanctuary, which I have hallowed for Myself in the midst of the land,
that I should set My name upon it, and that it should dwell (there). 11.
And they <span id="fr_46"></span>[4](#fn_46) will make to themselves
high places and groves and graven images, <span
id="fr_47"></span>[5](#fn_47) and they will worship, each his own
(graven image), so as to go astray, and they will sacrifice their
children to demons, <span id="fr_48"></span>[6](#fn_48) and to all the
works of the error of their hearts. 12. And I will send witnesses unto
them, that I may witness against them, but they will not hear, <span
id="fr_49"></span>[7](#fn_49) and will slay <span
id="fr_50"></span>[8](#fn_50) the witnesses also, and they will
persecute those who seek the law, and they will abrogate and change
everything so as to work evil before My eyes. 13. And I shall hide My
face from them, and I shall deliver them into the hand of the Gentiles
for captivity, and for a prey, and for devouring, <span
id="fr_51"></span>[9](#fn_51) and I shall remove them from the midst of
the land, and I shall scatter <span id="fr_52"></span>[10](#fn_52) them
amongst the Gentiles. 14. And they will forget all My law and all My
commandments and all My judgments, and will go astray as to new moons,
and sabbaths, and festivals, and jubilees, and ordinances. 15. And after
this they will turn to Me <span id="fr_53"></span>[11](#fn_53) from
amongst the Gentiles with all their heart and with all their soul and
with all their strength, and I shall gather them from amongst all the
Gentiles, <span id="fr_54"></span>[12](#fn_54) and they will seek Me, so
that I shall be found of them, when they seek Me

<span id="page_38">p. 38</span>

with all their heart and with all their soul. 16. And I shall disclose
to them abounding peace with righteousness, and I shall †remove them the
plant of uprightness†, <span id="fr_55"></span>[1](#fn_55) with all My
heart and with all My soul, <span id="fr_56"></span>[2](#fn_56) and they
will be for a blessing and not for a curse, <span
id="fr_57"></span>[3](#fn_57) and they will be the head and not the
tail. <span id="fr_58"></span>[4](#fn_58) 17. And I shall build My
sanctuary <span id="fr_59"></span>[5](#fn_59) in their midst, and I
shall dwell with them, and I shall be their God and they will be My
people <span id="fr_60"></span>[6](#fn_60) in truth and righteousness.
18. And I shall not forsake them nor fail them; <span
id="fr_61"></span>[7](#fn_61) for I am the Lord their God." 19. And
Moses fell on his face and prayed and said, "O Lord my God, do not
forsake Thy people and Thy inheritance, <span
id="fr_62"></span>[8](#fn_62) so that they should wander in the error of
their hearts, and do not deliver them into the hands of their enemies,
the Gentiles, lest they should rule over them and cause them to sin
against Thee. 20. Let Thy mercy, O Lord, be lifted up upon Thy people,
and create in them an upright spirit, <span
id="fr_63"></span>[9](#fn_63) and let not the spirit of Beliar <span
id="fr_64"></span>[10](#fn_64) rule over them to accuse them before
Thee, and to ensnare them from all the paths of righteousness, so that
they may perish from before Thy face. 21. But they are Thy people and
Thy inheritance, which Thou hast delivered with Thy great power <span
id="fr_65"></span>[11](#fn_65) from the hands of the Egyptians: create
in them a clean heart and a holy Spirit, <span
id="fr_66"></span>[12](#fn_66) and let them not be ensnared in their
sins from henceforth until eternity." 22. And the Lord said unto Moses:
"I know their contrariness and their thoughts and their
stiffneckedness, <span id="fr_67"></span>[13](#fn_67) and they will not
be obedient till they confess their own sin and the sin of their

<span id="page_39">p. 39</span>

fathers. <span id="fr_68"></span>[1](#fn_68) 23. And after this they
will turn to Me in all uprightness and with all (their) heart and with
all (their) soul, and I shall circumcise the foreskin of their
heart <span id="fr_69"></span>[2](#fn_69) and the foreskin of the heart
of their seed, and I shall create in them a holy spirit, and I shall
cleanse them so that they shall not turn away from Me from that day unto
eternity. 24. And their souls will cleave to Me and to all My
commandments, and they will fulfil My commandments, and I shall be their
Father and they will be My children. 25. And they will all be called
children of the living God, <span id="fr_70"></span>[3](#fn_70) and
every angel and every spirit will know, yea, they will know that these
are My children, and that I am their Father in uprightness and
righteousness, and that I love them. 26. And do thou write down for
thyself all these words <span id="fr_71"></span>[4](#fn_71) which I
declare unto thee on this mountain, the first and the last, which shall
come to pass in all the divisions of the days in the law and in the
testimony and in the weeks and the jubilees unto eternity, until I
descend and dwell with them <span id="fr_72"></span>[5](#fn_72)
throughout eternity."
