### Rebecca journeys with Jacob to Bethel (xxxi. 26-32).

26\. And in the morning Jacob told his father Isaac the vow which he had
vowed to the Lord, and the vision which he had seen, and that he had
built an altar, <span id="fr_735"></span>[1](#fn_732.md) and that
everything was ready for the sacrifice to be made before the Lord as he
had vowed, and that he had come to set him on an ass. 27. And Isaac said
unto Jacob his son: "I am not able to go with thee; for I am old, and
not able to bear the way: go, my son, in peace; for I am one hundred and
sixty-five years this day; I am no longer able to journey, set thy
mother (on an ass) and let her go with thee. 28. And I know, my son,
that thou hast come on my account, and may this day be blessed on which
thou hast seen me alive, and I also have seen thee, my son. 29. Mayest
thou prosper and fulfil the vow which thou hast vowed, and put not off
thy vow; for thou wilt be called to account as touching the vow; <span
id="fr_736"></span>[2](#fn_733.md) now therefore make haste to perform it,
and may He be pleased who hath made all things, to whom thou hast vowed
the vow." 30. And he said to Rebecca: "Go with Jacob thy son"; and
Rebecca went with Jacob her son, and Deborah with her, and they came to
Bethel. 31. And Jacob remembered the prayer with which his father had
blessed him and his two sons, Levi and Judah, and he rejoiced and
blessed the God of his fathers, Abraham and Isaac. 32. And he said: "Now
I know that I have an eternal hope, and my sons also, before the God of
all;" and thus is it ordained concerning the two; and they record it as
an eternal testimony unto them on the heavenly tables how Isaac blessed
them.
