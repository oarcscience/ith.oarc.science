### God commands the Angel to write (i. 27-29).

27\. And He said to the angel of the presence:  <span
id="fr_73"></span>[6](#fn_73) "Write <span id="fr_74"></span>[7](#fn_74.md)
for Moses from the beginning of creation till My sanctuary has been
built among them for all eternity. 28. <span
id="fr_75"></span>[8](#fn_75.md) And the Lord will appear to the eyes

<span id="page_40">p. 40</span>

of all, <span id="fr_76"></span>[1](#fn_76.md) and all will know that I am
the God of Israel and the Father of all the children of Jacob, <span
id="fr_77"></span>[2](#fn_77.md) and King on Mount Zion <span
id="fr_78"></span>[3](#fn_78.md) for all eternity. And Zion and Jerusalem
will be holy." 29. And the angel of the presence who went before the
camp of Israel <span id="fr_79"></span>[4](#fn_79.md) took the tables of
the divisions of the years <span id="fr_80"></span>[5](#fn_80.md)--from the
time of the creation--of the law and of the testimony of the weeks, of
the jubilees, according to the individual years, according to all the
number of the jubilees \[according to the individual years\], from the
day of the \[new\] creation †when† the heavens <span
id="fr_81"></span>[6](#fn_81.md) and the earth shall be renewed and all
their creation according to the powers of the heaven, and according to
all the creation of the earth, until the sanctuary of the Lord shall be
made in Jerusalem <span id="fr_82"></span>[7](#fn_82.md) on Mount Zion, and
all the luminaries be renewed for healing <span
id="fr_83"></span>[8](#fn_83.md) and for peace and for blessing for all the
elect of Israel, and that thus it may be from that day and unto all the
days of the earth.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_73"></span>[39:6](jub13.htm#fr_73.md) Cf. Isa. lxiii. 9;

Test. XII. Patr., Judah 25: probably Michael is meant. Note that the
medium of communication is an angel, and cf. Gal. iii. 19 (" The Law . .
. ordained through angels"). Later Judaism rejected this idea.

<span id="fn_74"></span>[39:7](jub13.htm#fr_74.md) *i. e.* not the
Pentateuch, "but a history up to the Messianic Kingdom" (Charles, in
Oxford *Corpus*).

<span id="fn_75"></span>[39:8](jub13.htm#fr_75.md) Read this ver. after
ver. 25.

<span id="fn_76"></span>[40:1](jub13.htm#fr_76.md) Cf. Rev. i. 7 (in the
final theophany).

<span id="fn_77"></span>[40:2](jub13.htm#fr_77.md) Cf. i. 24; Jer. xxxi. i.

<span id="fn_79"></span>[40:4](jub13.htm#fr_79.md) Cf. Exod. xiv. 19.

<span id="fn_80"></span>[40:5](jub13.htm#fr_80.md) From these the angel
dictates to Moses (who writes) the Book of Jubilees.

<span id="fn_81"></span>[40:6](jub13.htm#fr_81.md) Text corrupt. Read "from
the day of creation, till the heavens."

<span id="fn_82"></span>[40:7](jub13.htm#fr_82.md) *i. e.* in the Messianic
Kingdom.
