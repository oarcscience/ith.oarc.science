### Angelic Visitation of Abraham in Hebron; Promise of Isaac's Birth repeated. The Destruction of Sodom and Lot's Deliverance (xvi. 1-9; cf. Gen. xviii.-xix.).

XVI\. And on the new moon of the fourth month we <span
id="fr_466"></span>[1](#fn_466.md) appeared unto Abraham, at the oak of
Mamre, and we talked with him, and we announced to him that a son would
be given to him by Sarah his wife. <span id="fr_467"></span>[2](#fn_467.md)
2. And Sarah laughed, for she heard that we had spoken these words with
Abraham, and we admonished her, and she became afraid, and denied that
she had laughed on account of the words. <span
id="fr_468"></span>[3](#fn_468.md) 3. And we told her the name of her son,
as his name is ordained and written in the heavenly tables (*i.e.*)
Isaac. 4. And (that) when we returned to her at a set time, she would
have conceived a son. 5. And in this month the Lord executed his
judgments on Sodom, and Gomorrah, and Zeboim, <span
id="fr_469"></span>[4](#fn_469.md) and all the region of the Jordan, and He
burned them with fire and brimstone, and destroyed them until this day,
even as \[lo\] I have declared unto thee all their works, that they are
wicked and sinners exceedingly, and that they defile themselves and
commit fornication in their flesh, and work uncleanness on the
earth. <span id="fr_470"></span>[5](#fn_470.md) 6. And, in like manner, God
will execute judgment on the places where they have done according to
the uncleanness of the Sodomites, like unto the judgment of Sodom. 7.
But Lot we saved; for God remembered Abraham, and sent him out from the
midst of the overthrow. 8. And he and his daughters committed sin upon
the earth, such as had not been on the earth since the days of Adam till
his time; for the man lay with his daughters. <span
id="fr_471"></span>[6](#fn_471.md) 9. And, behold, it was commanded and
engraven concerning all his seed, on the heavenly tables, to remove them
and root them out, and to

<span id="page_104">p. 104</span>

execute judgment upon them like the judgment of Sodom, and to leave no
seed of the man on earth on the day of condemnation.
