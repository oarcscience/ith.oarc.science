### The Death and Burial of Abraham (xxiii. 1-8; cf. Gen. xxv. 7-10).

XXIII\. And he placed two fingers of Jacob on his eyes, <span
id="fr_604"></span>[3](#fn_602.md) and he blessed the God of gods, and he
covered his face and stretched out his feet <span
id="fr_605"></span>[4](#fn_603.md) and slept the sleep of eternity, <span
id="fr_606"></span>[5](#fn_604.md) and was gathered to his fathers. 2. And
notwithstanding all this Jacob was lying in his bosom, and knew not that
Abraham, his father's father, was dead. 3. And Jacob awoke from his
sleep, and behold Abraham was cold as ice, and he said: "Father,
father!"; but there was none that spake, and he knew that he was dead.
4. And he arose from his bosom and ran and told Rebecca, his mother; and
Rebecca went to Isaac in the night and told him; and they went together,
and Jacob with them, and a lamp was in his hand, and when they had gone
in they found Abraham lying dead. 5. And Isaac fell on the face of his
father, and wept and kissed him. <span id="fr_607"></span>[6](#fn_605.md)
6. And the voices were heard in the house of Abraham, and Ishmael his
son arose, and went to Abraham his father, and wept over

\[paragraph continues\] Abraham his father, he and all the house of
Abraham, and they wept with a great weeping. 7. And his sons Isaac and
Ishmael buried him in the double cave, <span
id="fr_608"></span>[1](#fn_606.md) near Sarah his wife, and they wept for
him forty days, all the men of his house, and Isaac and Ishmael, and all
their sons, and all the sons of Keturah in their places, and the days of
weeping for Abraham were ended. 8. And he lived three jubilees and four
weeks of years, one hundred and seventy-five years, and completed the
days of his life, being old and full of days.
