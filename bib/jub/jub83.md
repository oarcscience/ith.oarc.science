### The Death of Joseph. The Bones of Jacob's Sons (except Joseph) interred at Hebron. The Oppression of Israel by Egypt (xlvi. 1-16; cf. Gen. l.; Exod. i.).

XLVI\. And it came to pass that after Jacob died the children of Israel
multiplied in the land of Egypt, and they became a great nation, and
they were of one accord in heart, so that brother loved brother and
every man helped his brother, and they increased abundantly and
multiplied exceedingly, ten weeks

of years, all the days of the life of Joseph. <span
id="fr_890"></span>[5](#fn_882.md) 2. And there was no Satan <span
id="fr_891"></span>[6](#fn_883.md) nor any evil all the days of the life of
Joseph which he lived after his father Jacob, for all the Egyptians
honoured the children of Israel all the days of the life of Joseph. 3.
And Joseph died being a hundred and ten years old; <span
id="fr_892"></span>[7](#fn_884.md) seventeen years he lived in the land of
Canaan, and ten years he was a servant, and three years in prison, and
eighty years he was under the king, ruling all the land

<span id="page_202">p. 202</span>

of Egypt. 4. And he died and all his brethren and all that generation.
5. And he commanded the children of Israel before he died that they
should carry his bones with them when they went forth from the land of
Egypt. <span id="fr_893"></span>[1](#fn_885.md) 6. And he made them swear
regarding his bones, for he knew that the Egyptians would not again
bring forth and bury him in the land of Canaan, <span
id="fr_894"></span>[2](#fn_886.md) for Mâkamârôn, <span
id="fr_895"></span>[3](#fn_887.md) king of Canaan, while dwelling in the
land of Assyria, fought in the valley with the king of Egypt and slew
him there, and pursued after the Egyptians to the gates of ’Êrmôn. <span
id="fr_896"></span>[4](#fn_888.md) 7. But he was not able to enter, for
another, a new king, had become king of Egypt, <span
id="fr_897"></span>[5](#fn_889.md) and he was stronger than he, and he
returned to the land of Canaan, and the gates of Egypt were closed, and
none went out and none came into Egypt. 8. And Joseph died

in the forty-sixth jubilee, in the sixth week, in the second year, and
they buried him in the land of Egypt, and his brethren died after him.
9. And the king of Egypt went forth to war with the king of

Canaan in the forty-seventh jubilee, in the second week in the second
year, and the children of Israel brought forth all the bones of the
children of Jacob save the bones of Joseph, and they buried them in the
field in the double cave in the mountain. 10. And the most (of them)
returned to Egypt, but a few of them remained in the mountains of
Hebron, and

<span id="page_203">p. 203</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Amram thy father remained with them <span
id="fr_898"></span>[1](jub84.htm#fn_890.md). 11. And the king of Canaan was
victorious over the king of Egypt, and he closed the gates of Egypt. 12.
And he devised an evil device against the children of Israel of
afflicting them; and he said unto the people of Egypt: 13. "Behold the
people of the children of Israel have increased and multiplied more than
we. Come and let us deal wisely with them before they become too many,
and let us afflict them with slavery before war come upon us and before
they too fight against us; else they will join themselves unto our
enemies and get them up out of our land, for their hearts and faces are
towards the land of Canaan." 14. And he set over them taskmasters to
afflict them with slavery; and they built strong <span
id="fr_899"></span>[2](jub84.htm#fn_891.md) cities for Pharaoh, Pithom and
Raamses, and they built all the walls and all the fortifications which
had fallen in the cities of Egypt. 15. And they made them serve with
rigour, and the more they dealt evilly with them, the more they
increased and multiplied. 16. And the people of Egypt abominated the
children of Israel.
