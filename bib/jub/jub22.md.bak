### Genealogy of the Descendants of Shem: Noah and his Sons divide the Earth (viii. 1-30; cf. Gen. x.).

VIII\. In the twenty-ninth jubilee, in the first week,

|           |
|-----------|
| 1373 A M. |

in the beginning thereof Arpachshad took to himself a wife and her name
was Râsû’ĕjâ, \[the daughter of Sûsân,\] the daughter of Elam, and she
bare him a son in the third year in this week, and he called his name

|           |
|-----------|
| 1375 A.M. |

Kâinâm. <span id="fr_282"></span>[5](#fn_282.md) 2. And the son grew, and
his father taught

<span id="page_72">p. 72</span>

him writing, and he went to seek for himself a place where he might
seize for himself a city. 3. And he found a writing which former
(generations) had carved on the rock, and he read what was thereon, and
he transcribed it and sinned owing to it; for it contained the teaching
of the Watchers in accordance with which they used to observe the omens
of the sun and moon and stars in all the signs of heaven. <span
id="fr_283"></span>[1](#fn_283.md) 4. And he wrote it down and said nothing
regarding it; for he was afraid to speak to Noah about it lest he should
be angry with him on account of it. 5. And in the thirtieth jubilee, in
the second week, in the

|           |
|-----------|
| 1429 A.M. |

first year thereof, he took to himself a wife, and her name was Mêlkâ,
the daughter of Madai, the son of

|           |
|-----------|
| 1432 A.M. |

Japheth, and in the fourth year he begat a son, and called his name
Shelah; <span id="fr_284"></span>[2](#fn_284.md) for he said: "Truly I have
been sent." <span id="fr_285"></span>[3](#fn_285.md) 6. \[And in the fourth
year he was born\], and Shelah grew up and took to himself a wife, and
her name was Mû’ak, the daughter of Kêsêd, his father's brother, in the
one and thirtieth

|           |
|-----------|
| 1499 A.M. |

jubilee, in the fifth week, in the first year thereof. 7. And she bare
him a son in the fifth year thereof, and he called his name Eber: and he
took unto

|           |
|-----------|
| 1503 A.M. |

himself a wife, and her name was ’Azûrâd <span
id="fr_286"></span>[4](#fn_286.md) the daughter

|           |
|-----------|
| 1564 A.M. |

of Nêbrôd, in the thirty-second jubilee, in the seventh week, in the
third year thereof. 8. And in the sixth

|           |
|-----------|
| 1567 A.M. |

year thereof, she bare him a son, and he called his name Peleg; for in
the days when he was born the children of Noah began to divide the earth
amongst themselves: for this reason he called his name Peleg. <span
id="fr_287"></span>[5](#fn_287) 9. And they divided (it.md) secretly <span
id="fr_288"></span>[6](#fn_288.md) amongst themselves,

<span id="page_73">p. 73</span>

and told it to Noah. 10. And it came to pass in the beginning of the
thirty-third jubilee that they divided

|           |
|-----------|
| 1569 A.M. |

the earth into three parts, for Shem and Ham and Japheth, according to
the inheritance of each, in the first year in the first week, when one
of us, <span id="fr_289"></span>[1](#fn_289.md) who had been sent, was with
them. 11. And he called his sons, and they drew nigh to him, they and
their children, and he divided the earth into the lots, which his three
sons were to take in possession, and they reached forth their hands, and
took the writing out of the bosom of Noah, their father. 12. And there
came forth on the writing as Shem's lot <span
id="fr_290"></span>[2](#fn_290.md) the middle of the earth <span
id="fr_291"></span>[3](#fn_291.md) which he should take as an inheritance
for himself and for his sons for the generations of eternity, from the
middle of the mountain range of Râfâ, <span
id="fr_292"></span>[4](#fn_292.md) from the mouth of the water from the
river Tînâ. <span id="fr_293"></span>[5](#fn_293.md) and his portion goeth
towards the west through the midst of this river, and it extendeth till
it reacheth the water of the abysses, out of which this river goeth
forth and poureth its waters into the sea Mê’at, <span
id="fr_294"></span>[6](#fn_294.md) and this river floweth into the great
sea. And all that is towards the north is Japheth's, and all that is
towards the south belongeth to Shem. 13. And it extendeth till it
reacheth Kârâsô: <span id="fr_295"></span>[7](#fn_295.md) this is in the
bosom of the tongue <span id="fr_296"></span>[8](#fn_296.md) which looketh
towards the south. 14.

<span id="page_74">p. 74</span>

\[paragraph continues\] And his portion extendeth along the great sea,
and it extendeth in a straight line till it reacheth the west of the
tongue which looketh towards the south; <span
id="fr_297"></span>[1](#fn_297.md) for this sea is named the tongue of the
Egyptian Sea. <span id="fr_298"></span>[2](#fn_298.md) 15. And it turneth
from here towards the south towards the mouth of the great sea <span
id="fr_299"></span>[3](#fn_299) on the shore of (its.md) waters, and it
extendeth to the west to ‘Afrâ <span id="fr_300"></span>[4](#fn_300.md) and
it extendeth till it reacheth the waters of the river Gihon, and to the
south of the waters of Gihon, <span id="fr_301"></span>[5](#fn_301.md) to
the banks of this river. 16. And it extendeth towards the east, till it
reacheth the Garden of Eden, to the south thereof, \[to the south\] and
from the east of the whole land of Eden and of the whole cast, it
turneth to the †east,† <span id="fr_302"></span>[6](#fn_302.md) and
proceedeth till it reacheth the east of the mountain named Râfâ, and it
descendeth to the bank of the mouth of the river Tînâ. 17. This portion
came forth by lot for Shem and his sons, that they should possess it for
ever unto his generations for evermore. 18. And Noah rejoiced that this
portion came forth for Shem and for his sons, and he remembered all that
he had spoken with his mouth in prophecy; for he had said:

Blessed be the Lord God of Shem,  
And may the Lord dwell in the dwelling of Shem." <span
id="fr_303"></span>[7](#fn_303.md)

\[paragraph continues\] 19. And he knew that the Garden of Eden is the
holy of holies, and the dwelling of the Lord, and Mount Sinai the centre
of the desert, and Mount Zion--the centre of the navel of the earth:
these three <span id="fr_304"></span>[8](#fn_304.md) were created as holy
places facing each other. 20. And he blessed the God of gods, who had
put the word of the Lord into his mouth, and the Lord for evermore. 21.
And he knew that a blessed portion

<span id="page_75">p. 75</span>

and a blessing had come to Shem and his sons unto the generations for
ever--the whole land of Eden and the whole land of the Red Sea, and the
whole land of the east, and India, and on the Red Sea and the mountains
thereof, and all the land of Bashan, and all the land of Lebanon and the
islands of Kaftûr, <span id="fr_305"></span>[1](#fn_305.md) and all the
mountains of Sanîr <span id="fr_306"></span>[2](#fn_306.md) and
’Amânâ, <span id="fr_307"></span>[3](#fn_307.md) and the mountains of
Asshur in the north, and all the land of Elam, Asshur, and Bâbêl, and
Sûsân and Mâ‘ĕdâi <span id="fr_308"></span>[4](#fn_308.md) and all the
mountains of Ararat, and all the region beyond the sea, which is beyond
the mountains of Asshur towards the north, a blessed and spacious land,
and all that is in it is very good. 22. <span
id="fr_309"></span>[5](#fn_309.md) And for Ham came forth the second
portion, beyond the Gihon towards the south to the right <span
id="fr_310"></span>[6](#fn_310.md) of the Garden, and it extendeth towards
the south and it extendeth to all the mountains of fire, <span
id="fr_311"></span>[7](#fn_311.md) and it extendeth towards the west to the
sea of ’Atêl <span id="fr_312"></span>[8](#fn_312.md) and it extendeth
towards the west till it reacheth the sea of Mâ’ûk <span
id="fr_313"></span>[9](#fn_313)--that (sea.md) into which †everything which
is not destroyed descendeth†. <span id="fr_314"></span>[10](#fn_314.md) 23.
And it goeth forth towards the north to the limits of Gâdîr, <span
id="fr_315"></span>[11](#fn_315.md) and it goeth forth to the coast of the
waters of the sea to the waters of the great sea till it draweth near to
the river Gihon, and goeth along the river Gihon till it reacheth the
right of the Garden of Eden. 24. And this is the land which came forth
for Ham as the portion which he was to occupy for ever for himself and
his sons unto their

<span id="page_76">p. 76</span>

generations for ever. 25. <span id="fr_316"></span>[1](#fn_316.md) And for
Japheth came forth the third portion beyond <span
id="fr_317"></span>[2](#fn_317.md) the river Tînâ <span
id="fr_318"></span>[3](#fn_318.md) to the north of the outflow of its
waters, and it extendeth north-easterly to the whole region of Gog <span
id="fr_319"></span>[4](#fn_319.md) and to all the country east thereof. 26.
And it extendeth northerly to the north, and it extendeth to the
mountains of Qêlt <span id="fr_320"></span>[5](#fn_320.md)towards the
north, and towards the sea of Mâ’ûk, and it goeth forth to the east of
Gâdîr as far as the region of the waters of the sea. 27. And it
extendeth until it approacheth the west of Fârâ <span
id="fr_321"></span>[6](#fn_321.md) and it returneth towards ’Afêrâg, <span
id="fr_322"></span>[7](#fn_322.md) and it extendeth easterly to the waters
of the sea of Mê’at. <span id="fr_323"></span>[8](#fn_323.md) 28. And it
extendeth to the region of the river Tînâ in a northeasterly direction
until it approacheth the boundary of its waters towards the mountain
Râfâ, <span id="fr_324"></span>[9](#fn_324.md) and it turneth round towards
the north. 29. This is the land which came forth for Japheth and his
sons as the portion of his inheritance which he should possess for
himself and his sons, for their generations for ever; five great
islands, <span id="fr_325"></span>[10](#fn_325.md) and a great land in the
north. 30. But it is cold, and the land of Ham is hot, and the land of
Shem is neither hot nor cold, but it is of blended cold and heat.
