### Noah offers Sacrifice; the Cursing of Canaan (cf. Gen. ix. 20-28): Noah's Sons and Grandsons (cf. Gen. x.) and their Cities. Noah's Admonitions (vii. 1-39).

| 1317 A.M. |

VII\. And in the seventh week in the first year thereof, in this
jubilee, Noah planted vines on the mountain on which the ark had rested,
named Lûbâr, <span id="fr_243"></span>[2](#fn_243.md) one of the Ararat
Mountains, and they

|           |
|-----------|
| 1320 A.M. |

produced fruit in the fourth year, <span id="fr_244"></span>[3](#fn_244.md)
and he guarded their fruit, and gathered it in this year in the seventh
month. 2. And he made wine therefrom and put it

|           |
|-----------|
| 1321 A.M. |

into a vessel, and kept it until the fifth year, until the first day, on
the new moon of the first month. 3. And he celebrated with joy the day
of this feast, and he made a burnt sacrifice unto the Lord, one young ox
and one ram, and seven sheep, each a year old, and a kid of the goats,
that he might make atonement thereby for himself and his sons. <span
id="fr_245"></span>[4](#fn_245.md) 4. And he prepared the kid first, and
placed some of its blood on the flesh that was on the altar which he had
made, and all the

<span id="page_67">p. 67</span>

fat he laid on the altar where he made the burnt sacrifice, and the ox
and the ram and the sheep, and he laid all their flesh upon the altar.
5. And he placed all their offerings mingled with oil upon it, and
afterwards he sprinkled wine on the fire which he had previously made on
the altar, and he placed incense on the altar and caused a sweet savour
to ascend acceptable before the Lord his God. 6. And he rejoiced and
drank of this wine, he and his children with joy. 7. And it was evening,
and he went into his tent, and being drunken he lay down and slept, and
was uncovered in his tent as he slept. <span
id="fr_246"></span>[1](#fn_246.md) 8. And Ham saw Noah his father naked,
and went forth and told his two brethren without. 9. And Shem took his
garment and arose, he and Japheth, and they placed the garment on their
shoulders and went backward and covered the shame of their father, and
their faces were backward. <span id="fr_247"></span>[2](#fn_247.md) 10. And
Noah awoke from his sleep and knew all that his younger son had done
unto him, and he cursed his son and said: "Cursed be Canaan; an enslaved
servant shall he be unto his brethren." <span
id="fr_248"></span>[3](#fn_248.md) 11. And he blessed Shem, and said:
"Blessed be the Lord God of Shem, and Canaan shall be his servant. 12.
God shall enlarge Japheth, and God shall dwell in the dwelling of Shem,
and Canaan shall be his servant." <span id="fr_249"></span>[4](#fn_249.md)
13. And Ham knew that his father had cursed his younger son, and he was
displeased that he had cursed his son, and he parted from his father, he
and his sons with him, Cush and Mizraim and Put and Canaan. <span
id="fr_250"></span>[5](#fn_250.md) 14. And he built for himself a city and
called its name after the name of his wife Nê’êlâtamâ’ûk. 15. And
Japheth saw it, and became envious of his brother, and he too built for
himself a city, and he called its name after the name of his wife
’Adâtanêsês. 16. And Shem dwelt with his father Noah, and he built a
city close to his father on the mountain, and he too called its name

<span id="page_68">p. 68</span>

after the name of his wife Sêdêqêtêlĕbâb. <span
id="fr_251"></span>[1](#fn_251.md) 17. And behold these three cities are
near Mount Lûbâr; Sêdêqêtêlĕbâb fronting the mountain on its east; and
Na’êlâtamâ’ûk on the south; ’Adatanêsês towards the west. 18. And these
are the sons of Shem: Elam, and Asshur, and Arpachshad--this (son) was
born two years after the flood--and Lud, and Aram. <span
id="fr_252"></span>[2](#fn_252.md) 19. The sons of Japheth: Gomer and Magog
and Madai and Javan, Tubal and Meshech and Tiras: these are

|                |
|----------------|
| 1324-1372 A.M. |

the sons of Noah. <span id="fr_253"></span>[3](#fn_253.md) 20. <span
id="fr_254"></span>[4](#fn_254.md) And in the twenty-eighth jubilee Noah
began to enjoin upon his sons' sons the ordinances and commandments, and
all the judgments that he knew, and he exhorted his sons to observe
righteousness, and to cover the shame <span
id="fr_255"></span>[5](#fn_255.md) of their flesh, and to bless their
Creator, and honour father and mother, and love their neighbour, and
guard their souls from fornication and uncleanness and all iniquity. 21.
For owing to these three things <span id="fr_256"></span>[6](#fn_256.md)
came the flood upon the earth, namely, owing to the fornication wherein
the Watchers against the law of their ordinances went a whoring after
the daughters of men, and took themselves wives of all which they
chose: <span id="fr_257"></span>[7](#fn_257.md) and they made the beginning
of uncleanness. 22. And they begat sons the Nâphîdîm, <span
id="fr_258"></span>[8](#fn_258.md) and †they were all unlike†, <span
id="fr_259"></span>[9](#fn_259.md) and they devoured one another: and the
Giants slew the Nâphîl, and the Nâphîl slew the Eljô, and the Eljô
mankind, and one man another. 23. And every one sold himself <span
id="fr_260"></span>[10](#fn_260.md) to work iniquity and to

<span id="page_69">p. 69</span>

shed much blood, <span id="fr_261"></span>[1](#fn_261.md) and the earth was
filled with iniquity. <span id="fr_262"></span>[2](#fn_262.md) 24. And
after this they sinned against the beasts and birds, and all that moveth
and walketh on the earth: <span id="fr_263"></span>[3](#fn_263.md) and much
blood was shed on the earth, and every imagination and desire of men
imagined vanity and evil continually. <span
id="fr_264"></span>[4](#fn_264.md) 25. And the Lord destroyed everything
from off the face of the earth; <span id="fr_265"></span>[5](#fn_265.md)
because of the wickedness of their deeds, and because of the blood which
they had shed in the midst of the earth He destroyed everything. 26.
"And we were left, I <span id="fr_266"></span>[6](#fn_266.md) and you, my
sons, and everything that entered with us into the ark, and behold I see
your works before me that ye do not walk in righteousness; for in the
path of destruction ye have begun to walk, and ye are parting one from
another, and are envious one of another, and (so it cometh) that ye are
not in harmony, my sons, each with his brother. 27. For I see, and
behold the demons have begun (their) seductions against you and against
your children, and now I fear on your behalf, that after my death ye
will shed the blood of men upon the earth, and that ye, too, will be
destroyed from the face of the earth. <span
id="fr_267"></span>[7](#fn_267.md) 28. For whoso sheddeth man's blood, and
whoso eateth the blood of any flesh, will all be destroyed from the
earth. <span id="fr_268"></span>[8](#fn_268.md)

29\. And there will not be left any man that eateth blood.  
Or that sheddeth the blood of man on the earth,  
Nor will there be left to him any seed or descendants living under
heaven;  
For into Sheol will they go,  
And into the place of condemnation will they descend. <span
id="page_70">p. 70</span>  
And into the darkness of the deep will they all be removed by a violent
death. <span id="fr_269"></span>[1](#fn_269.md)

30\. There shall be no blood seen upon you of all the blood there shall
be all the days in which ye have killed any beasts or cattle or whatever
flieth upon the earth, and work ye a good work to your souls by covering
that which hath been shed <span id="fr_270"></span>[2](#fn_270.md) on the
face of the earth. 31. And ye shall not be like him who eateth with
blood, but guard yourselves that none may eat blood before you: <span
id="fr_271"></span>[3](#fn_271.md) cover the blood, for thus have I been
commanded to testify to you and your children, together with all flesh.
32. And suffer not the soul to be eaten with the flesh, that your blood,
which is your life, may not be required at the hand of any flesh that
sheddeth (it) on the earth. <span id="fr_272"></span>[4](#fn_272.md) 33.
For the earth will not be clean from the blood which hath been shed upon
it; <span id="fr_273"></span>[5](#fn_273) for (only.md) through the blood
of him that shed it <span id="fr_274"></span>[6](#fn_274.md) will the earth
be purified throughout all its generations. 34. And now, my children,
hearken: work judgment and righteousness that ye may be planted in
righteousness <span id="fr_275"></span>[7](#fn_275.md) over the face of the
whole earth, and your glory lifted up before my God, who saved me from
the waters of the flood. <span id="fr_276"></span>[8](#fn_276.md) 35. And
behold, ye will go and build for yourselves cities, and plant in them
all the plants that are upon the earth, and moreover all fruit-bearing
trees. 36. For three years the fruit of everything that is eaten will
not be gathered: and in the fourth year its fruit will be accounted holy
\[and they will offer the first-fruits\], <span
id="fr_277"></span>[9](#fn_277.md)

<span id="page_71">p. 71</span>

acceptable before the Most High God, who created heaven and earth and
all things. Let them offer in abundance the first of the wine and oil
(as) first-fruits on the altar of the Lord, who receiveth it, and what
is left let the servants of the house of the Lord <span
id="fr_278"></span>[1](#fn_278.md) eat before the altar which receiveth
(it). 37. And in the fifth year <span id="fr_279"></span>[2](#fn_279.md)

.        .        .        .        .        .        .

make ye the release so that ye release it <span
id="fr_280"></span>[3](#fn_280.md) in righteousness and uprightness, and ye
shall be righteous, and all that you plant will prosper. 38. For thus
did Enoch, the father of your father command Methuselah, his son, and
Methuselah his son Lamech, and Lamech commanded me all the things which
his fathers commanded him. 39. And I also will give you commandment, my
sons, as Enoch commanded his son in the first jubilees: whilst still
living, the seventh <span id="fr_281"></span>[4](#fn_281.md) in his
generation, he commanded and testified to his son and to his sons' sons
until the day of his death."
