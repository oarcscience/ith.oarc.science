### BIBLIOGRAPHY

The important edition of the Ethiopic text by Charles has already been
referred to, as well as his English translation of the Book with
Introduction and Notes (1902). This translation has also been reprinted
(with an Introduction and Notes) in the Oxford *Corpus* (vol. ii.
Pseudepigrapha, 1913) and is reproduced in the pages that follow.

The most recent, and in many respects the most important, discussion of
*Jubilees* is contained in Leszynsky's *Die Sadduzäer* (Berlin, 1912),
pp. 179-236. Leszynsky's arguments have been referred to fully above.
Kohler's article in *JE*, vol. vii. ("Jubilees Book of") is interesting
and useful. Of earlier works the following are important:

Jellinek, *Ueber das Büch der Jubiläen* (1855);

Beer, *Das Büch der Jubiläen und sein Verhältniss zu den Midraschim*,
(Leipzig, 18,56); also *Noch ein Wort über das Bitch der Jubiläen*
(1857)

Frankel in *Monatsschrift* (1856);

Singer, *Das Büch der Jubiläen oder die Leptogenesis* (Stuhlweissenburg,
1898).

There is a good discussion in Schürer *GJV.*, iii. 371-384, with full
Bibliography.

(At this point the page numbers shift directly from Roman to Arabic
numerals, rather than restarting at page I as is the normal practice.
Hence, p. 34 follows p. xxxiii--*JBH*.)
