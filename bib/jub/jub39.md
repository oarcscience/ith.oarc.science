15\. And it came to pass in the seventh week, in the first year thereof,
in the first month in this jubilee, <span
id="fr_505"></span>[4](#fn_505) on the twelfth of this month, there were
voices in heaven regarding Abraham, that he was faithful in all that He
told him, and that he loved the Lord, and that in every affliction he
was faithful. 16. And the

prince Mastêmâ <span id="fr_506"></span>[1](jub40.htm#fn_506) came and
said before God, "Behold, Abraham loveth Isaac his son, and he
delighteth in him above all things else; bid him offer him as a
burnt-offering on the altar, and Thou wilt see if he will do this
command, and Thou wilt know if he is faithful in everything wherein Thou
dost try him." 17. And the Lord knew that Abraham was faithful in all
his afflictions; for He had tried him through his country and with
famine, and had tried him with the wealth of kings, and had tried him
again through his wife, when she was torn (from him), and with
circumcision, and had tried him through Ishmael and Hagar, his
maid-servant, when he sent them away. <span
id="fr_507"></span>[2](jub40.htm#fn_507) 18. And in everything wherein
He had tried him, he was found faithful, and his soul was not impatient,
and he was not slow to act; for he was faithful and a lover of the Lord.
