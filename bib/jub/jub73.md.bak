### The War between Jacob and Esau at the Tower of Hebron. The Death of Esau and Overthrow of his Forces (xxxviii. 1-4).

XXXVIII\. And after that Judah spake to Jacob, his father, and said unto
him: "Bend thy bow, father, and send forth thy arrows and cast down the
adversary and slay the enemy; and mayest thou have the power, for we
shall not slay thy brother, for he is such as thou, and he is like thee:
let us give him (this) honour." 2. Then Jacob bent his bow and sent
forth the arrow and struck Esau, his brother, (on his right breast) and
slew him. <span id="fr_825"></span>[2](#fn_817.md) 3. And again he sent
forth an arrow and struck ’Adôrân the Aramaean, <span
id="fr_826"></span>[3](#fn_818.md) on the left breast, and drove him
backward and slew him. 4. And then went forth the sons of Jacob, they
and their servants, dividing themselves into companies on the four sides
of the tower. 5. And

\[paragraph continues\] Judah went forth in front, and Naphtali and Gad
with him and fifty servants with him on the south side of the tower, and
they slew all they found before them, and not one individual of them
escaped. 6. And Levi and Dan and Asher went forth on the east side of
the tower, and fifty (men) with them, and they slew the fighting men of
Moab and Ammon. 7. And Reuben and Issachar and Zebulon went forth on the
north side of the tower, and fifty men with them, and they slew the
fighting men of the Philistines. 8. And Simeon and Benjamin and Enoch,
Reuben's son, went forth on the west side of the tower, and fifty (men)
with them, and they slew of Edom and of the Horites four hundred men,
stout warriors; and six hundred fled, and four of the sons of Esau fled
with them, and left their father lying slain, as he had fallen on the
hill which is in ’Adûrâm. <span id="fr_827"></span>[1](#fn_819.md) 9. And
the sons of Jacob pursued after them to the mountains of Seir. And Jacob
buried his brother on the hill which is in ’Adûrâm, and he returned to
his house. 10. And the sons of Jacob pressed hard upon the sons of Esau
in the mountains of Seir, and bowed their necks so that they became
servants of the sons of Jacob. 11. And they sent to their father (to
inquire) whether they should make peace with them or slay them. 12. And
Jacob sent word to his sons that they should make peace, and they made
peace with them, and placed the yoke of servitude upon them, so that
they paid tribute to Jacob and to his sons always. 13. And they
continued to pay tribute to Jacob until the day that he went down into
Egypt. <span id="fr_828"></span>[2](#fn_820.md) 14. And the sons of Edom
have not got quit of the yoke of servitude which the twelve sons of
Jacob had imposed on them until this day. <span
