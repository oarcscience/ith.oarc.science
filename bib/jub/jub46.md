### Abraham's Last Words to Isaac (xxi. 1-25).

| 2057 (?2050) A.M. |

XXI\. And in the sixth year of the †seventh† <span
id="fr_548"></span>[1](#fn_546.md) week of this jubilee Abraham called
Isaac his son, <span id="fr_549"></span>[2](#fn_547.md) and commanded him,
saying: "I am become old, and. know not the day of my death, <span
id="fr_550"></span>[3](#fn_548.md) and am full of my days. <span
id="fr_551"></span>[4](#fn_549.md) 2. And behold, I am one hundred and
seventy-five years old, <span id="fr_552"></span>[5](#fn_550.md) and
throughout all the days of my life I have remembered the Lord, and
sought with all my heart to do His will, and to walk uprightly in all
His ways. 3. My soul hath hated idols, (and I have despised those that
served them, and I have given my heart and spirit) <span
id="fr_553"></span>[6](#fn_551.md) that I might observe to do the will of
Him who created me. 4. For He is the living God, and He is holy and
faithful, and He is righteous beyond all, and there is with Him no
accepting of (men's) persons and no accepting of gifts; <span
id="fr_554"></span>[7](#fn_552.md) for God is righteous, and executeth

<span id="page_119">p. 119</span>

judgment on all those who transgress His commandments and despise His
covenant. 5. And do thou, my son, observe His commandments and His
ordinances and His judgments, and walk not after the abominations and
after the graven images and after the molten images. 6. And eat no blood
at all of animals or cattle, or of any bird which flieth in the
heaven. <span id="fr_555"></span>[1](#fn_553.md) 7. <span
id="fr_556"></span>[2](#fn_554.md) And if thou dost slay a victim as an
acceptable peace-offering, slay ye it, and pour out its blood upon the
altar, and all the fat of the offering offer on the altar with fine
flour (and the meat-offering) mingled with oil, <span
id="fr_557"></span>[3](#fn_555.md) with its drink-offering--offer them all
together on the altar of burnt-offering; it is a sweet savour before the
Lord. <span id="fr_558"></span>[4](#fn_556.md) 8. And thou wilt offer the
fat of the sacrifice of thank-offerings on the fire which is upon the
altar, and the fat which is on the belly, and all the fat on the inwards
and the two kidneys, and all the fat that is upon them, and upon the
loins and liver thou shalt remove together with the kidneys. <span
id="fr_559"></span>[5](#fn_557.md) 9. And offer all these for a sweet
savour acceptable before the Lord, with its meat-offering and with its
drink-offering, for a sweet savour, the bread <span
id="fr_560"></span>[6](#fn_558.md) of the offering unto the Lord, 10. And
eat its meat on that day and on the second day, and let not the sun on
the second day go down upon it till it is eaten, and let nothing be left
over for the third day; for it is not acceptable \[for it is not
approved\] <span id="fr_561"></span>[7](#fn_559.md) and let it no longer be
eaten, and all who eat thereof will bring sin upon themselves; for thus
I have found it written in the books of my forefathers, and in the words
of Enoch, and in the words of Noah. <span
id="fr_562"></span>[8](#fn_560.md) 11. And on all

<span id="page_120">p. 120</span>

thy oblations thou shalt strew salt, and let not the salt of the
covenant be lacking in all thy oblations before the Lord. <span
id="fr_563"></span>[1](#fn_561.md) 12. And as regards the wood of the
sacrifices, beware lest thou bring (other) wood for the altar in
addition to these: <span id="fr_564"></span>[2](#fn_562.md) cypress,
dêfrân, <span id="fr_565"></span>[3](#fn_563.md) sagâd, pine, fir, cedar,
savin, palm, olive, myrrh, laurel, and citron, juniper, and balsam. 13.
And of these kinds of wood lay upon the altar under the sacrifice, such
as have been tested as to their appearance, and do not lay (thereon) any
split or dark wood, (but) hard and clean, without fault, a sound and new
growth; and do not lay (thereon) old wood, \[for its fragrance is gone\]
for there is no longer fragrance in it as before. <span
id="fr_566"></span>[4](#fn_564.md) 14. Besides these kinds of wood there is
none other that thou shalt place (on the altar), for the fragrance is
dispersed, and the smell of its fragrance goeth not up to heaven. 15.
Observe this commandment and do it, my son, that thou mayst be upright
in all thy deeds. 16. And at all times be clean in thy body, and wash
thyself with water before thou approachest to offer on the altar, and
wash thy hands and thy feet before thou drawest near to the altar; and
when thou art done sacrificing, wash again thy hands and thy feet. <span
id="fr_567"></span>[5](#fn_565.md) 17. And let no blood appear upon you nor
upon your clothes; be on thy guard, my son, against blood, be on thy
guard exceedingly; cover it with dust. <span
id="fr_568"></span>[6](#fn_566.md) 18. And do not eat any blood, for it is
the soul; eat no blood whatever. <span id="fr_569"></span>[7](#fn_567.md)
19. And take no gifts for the blood of man, lest it be shed with
impunity, without judgment; for it is the blood that

<span id="page_121">p. 121</span>

is shed that causeth the earth to sin, and the earth cannot be cleansed
from the blood of man save by the blood of him who shed it. <span
id="fr_570"></span>[1](#fn_568.md) 20. And take no present or gift for the
blood of man: blood for blood, that thou mayest be accepted before the
Lord, the Most High God; for He is the defence of the good: and that
thou mayest be preserved from all evil, and that He may save thee from
every kind of death..

21\. I see, my son,  
That all the works of the children of men are sin and wickedness,  
And all their deeds are uncleanness and an abomination and a
pollution,  
And there is no righteousness with them.  
22. Beware, lest thou shouldest walk in their ways  
And tread in their paths,  
And sin a sin unto death <span id="fr_571"></span>[2](#fn_569.md) before
the Most High God.  
Else He will \[hide His face from thee,  
And\] <span id="fr_572"></span>[3](#fn_570.md) give thee back into the
hands <span id="fr_573"></span>[4](#fn_571.md) of thy transgression,  
And root thee out of the land, and thy seed likewise from under
heaven,  
And thy name and thy seed will perish from the whole earth.  
23. Turn away from all their deeds and all their uncleanness,  
And observe the ordinance of the Most High God,  
And do His will and be upright in all things.  
24. And He will bless thee in all thy deeds,  
And will raise up from thee the plant of righteousness <span
id="fr_574"></span>[5](#fn_572.md) through all the earth, throughout all
generations of the earth,  
And my name and thy name will not be forgotten under heaven for ever.
<span id="page_122">p. 122</span>  
25. Go, my son, in peace.  
May the Most High God, my God and thy God, strengthen thee to do His
will,  
And may He bless all thy seed and the residue of thy seed for the
generations for ever, with all righteous blessings,  
That thou mayest be a blessing on all the earth." <span
id="fr_575"></span>[1](#fn_573.md)

\[paragraph continues\] 26. And he went out from him rejoicing.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_546"></span>[118:1](jub46.htm#fr_548.md) Read "sixth"
(Charles).

<span id="fn_547"></span>[118:2](jub46.htm#fr_549.md) The rest of this
chapter purports to give Abraham's directions to Isaac regarding certain
kinds of sacrifice. It has a remarkable parallel in *Test. XII
Patriarchs*, Levi ix., where Isaac instructs Levi in the law of the
priesthood, of sacrifices, etc. The latter is much shorter than our
chapter, but hardly more original. The two books may have used a common
source.

<span id="fn_548"></span>[118:3](jub46.htm#fr_550.md) In Gen. xxvii. 2
these words are uttered by Isaac.

<span id="fn_549"></span>[118:4](jub46.htm#fr_551.md) Cf. Gen. xxv. 8,
where LXX, Sam., Vulg. read "full of days," but MT omits "days."

<span id="fn_550"></span>[118:5](jub46.htm#fr_552.md) Cf. Gen. xxv. 7.

<span id="fn_551"></span>[118:6](jub46.htm#fr_553.md) The bracketed words
are supplied from the Latin.

<span id="fn_552"></span>[118:7](jub46.htm#fr_554.md) Cf. Deut. x. 17.

<span id="fn_553"></span>[119:1](jub46.htm#fr_555) Cf. vii. 28 (note.md).

<span id="fn_554"></span>[119:2](jub46.htm#fr_556.md) For 7-9 cf. the
summary in *Test. XII Patr.* Levi ix. 7.

<span id="fn_555"></span>[119:3](jub46.htm#fr_557.md) Cf. Lev. ii. 4.

<span id="fn_556"></span>[119:4](jub46.htm#fr_558.md) For 7 cf. Lev. iii.
7-10.

<span id="fn_557"></span>[119:5](jub46.htm#fr_559.md) Cf. Lev. iii. 9-10.

<span id="fn_558"></span>[119:6](jub46.htm#fr_560.md) "Or food"; cf. Lev.
iii. 11.

<span id="fn_559"></span>[119:7](jub46.htm#fr_561.md) Bracketed words a
dittograph.

<span id="fn_560"></span>[119:8](jub46.htm#fr_562.md) No trace of such
halakic rules exists in the Books of Enoch or the fragments of the Noah
apocalypse that are extant. The statement in the text seems to be
original to the author of *Jubilees*.

<span id="fn_561"></span>[120:1](jub46.htm#fr_563.md) Cf. Lev. ii. 13;
*Test. Levi* ix. 14.

<span id="fn_562"></span>[120:2](jub46.htm#fr_564.md) In *Test. Levi* ix.
12 "twelve" evergreen trees are mentioned; here fourteen, and this
number is probably correct.

<span id="fn_563"></span>[120:3](jub46.htm#fr_565.md) Probably a kind of
fir.

<span id="fn_564"></span>[120:4](jub46.htm#fr_566.md) This may be the old
halaka; the Mishna has no trace of it. The Mishna (*Tamid* ii. 3) allows
all kinds of wood except that of the olive and vine; cf., also, *Sifra*
on Lev. i. 8.

<span id="fn_565"></span>[120:5](jub46.htm#fr_567.md) Cf. Exod. xxx. 19-21;
cf. *Test. Levi* ix. ii.

<span id="fn_566"></span>[120:6](jub46.htm#fr_568.md) Cf. Lev. xvii. 13.

<span id="fn_567"></span>[120:7](jub46.htm#fr_569.md) Cf. Lev. xvii. 14;
Deut. xii. 23.

<span id="fn_568"></span>[121:1](jub46.htm#fr_570.md) Cf. vii. 33; Num.
xxxv. 33.

<span id="fn_569"></span>[121:2](jub46.htm#fr_571.md) Cf. xxxiii. 18.

<span id="fn_570"></span>[121:3](jub46.htm#fr_572.md) Bracketed by Charles
as an interpolation.

<span id="fn_571"></span>[121:4](jub46.htm#fr_573.md) *i. e.* into the
power of.

<span id="fn_572"></span>[121:5](jub46.htm#fr_574.md) Cf. xvi. 26.

<span id="fn_573"></span>[122:1](jub46.htm#fr_575.md) Cf. xx. 10.
