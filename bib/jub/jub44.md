| 2052 (?2045) A.M. |

year of the †seventh† <span id="fr_533"></span>[4](#fn_531) week,
Abraham called Ishmael, and his twelve sons, <span
id="fr_534"></span>[5](#fn_532) and Isaac and his two sons, and the six
sons of Keturah, and their sons. 2. And he commanded them that they
should observe the way of the Lord; that they should work righteousness,
and love each his neighbour, and act

<span id="page_116">p. 116</span>

on this manner amongst all men; that they should each so walk with
regard to them as to do judgment and righteousness on the earth. 3. That
they should circumcise their sons, <span id="fr_535"></span>[1](#fn_533)
according to the covenant which He had made with them, and not deviate
to the right hand or the left of all the paths which the Lord had
commanded us; and that we should keep ourselves from all fornication and
uncleanness, \[and renounce from amongst us all fornication and
uncleanness\]. <span id="fr_536"></span>[2](#fn_534) 4. And if any woman
or maid commit fornication amongst you, burn her with fire, <span
id="fr_537"></span>[3](#fn_535) and let them not commit fornication with
her after their eyes and their heart; and let them not take to
themselves wives from the daughters of Canaan; for the seed of Canaan
will be rooted out of the land. 5. And he told them of the judgment of
the giants, and the judgment of the Sodomites, how they had been judged
on account of their wickedness, and had died on account of their
fornication, and uncleanness, and mutual corruption through
fornication. <span id="fr_538"></span>[4](#fn_536)

6\. "And guard yourselves from all fornication and uncleanness,  
And from all pollution of sin,  
Lest ye make our name a curse,  
And your whole life a hissing, <span id="fr_539"></span>[5](#fn_537)  
And all your sons be destroyed by the sword,  
And ye become accursed like Sodom,  
And all your remnant as the sons of Gomorrah.  
7. I implore you, my sons, love the God of heaven,  
And cleave ye to all His commandments. <span id="page_117">p.
117</span>  
And walk not after their idols, and after their uncleannesses,  
8. <span id="fr_540"></span>[1](#fn_538) And make not for yourselves
molten or graven gods; <span id="fr_541"></span>[2](#fn_539)  
For they are vanity,  
And there is no spirit in them;  
For they are work of (men's) hands,  
And all who trust in them, trust in nothing.  
Serve them not, nor worship them, <span
id="fr_542"></span>[3](#fn_540)  
9. But serve ye the Most High God, and worship Him continually:  
And hope for His countenance always,  
And work uprightness and righteousness before Him,  
That He may have pleasure in you and grant you His mercy,  
And send rain <span id="fr_543"></span>[4](#fn_541) upon you morning and
evening,  
And bless all your works which ye have wrought upon the earth,  
And bless thy bread and thy water, <span
id="fr_544"></span>[5](#fn_542)  
And bless the fruit of thy womb and the fruit of thy land,  
And the herds of thy cattle, and the flocks of thy sheep. <span
id="fr_545"></span>[6](#fn_543)  
10. And ye will be for a blessing <span id="fr_546"></span>[7](#fn_544)
on the earth,  
And all nations of the earth will desire you,  
And bless your sons in my name,  
That they may be blessed as I am."

11\. And he gave to Ishmael and to his sons, and to the sons of Keturah,
gifts, and sent them away from Isaac his son, and he gave everything to
Isaac his son. <span id="fr_547"></span>[8](#fn_545)

descendants. According to *Pirḳe de R. Eliezer* xxix., Esau, though he
had been circumcised, "despised circumcision" (his birthright).
