### Paradise and the Fall (iii. 1-35; cf. Gen. ii. 4-iii .).

III\. And on the six days of the second week we brought, according to
the word of God, unto Adam all the beasts, and all the cattle, and all
the birds, and everything that moveth on the earth, and everything that
moveth in the water, according to their kinds, and according to their
types: the beasts on the first day; the cattle on the second day; the
birds on the third day; and all that which moveth on the earth on the
fourth day; and that which moveth in the water on the fifth day. 2. And
Adam named them all by their respective names, and as he called them, so
was their name. <span id="fr_123"></span>[5](#fn_123.md) 3. And on these
five days Adam saw all these, male and female, according to every kind
that was on the earth, but he was alone and found no helpmeet

<span id="page_47">p. 47</span>

for him. <span id="fr_124"></span>[1](#fn_124.md) 4. And the Lord said unto
us: "It is not good that the man should be alone: let us make a helpmeet
for him." <span id="fr_125"></span>[2](#fn_125.md) 5. And the Lord our God
caused a deep sleep to fall upon him, and he slept, and He took for the
woman one rib from amongst his ribs, and this rib was the origin of the
woman from amongst his ribs, and He built up the flesh in its stead, and
built the woman. 6. And He awaked Adam out of his sleep and on awaking
he rose on the sixth day, and He brought her to him, and he knew her,
and said unto her: "This is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh;
she will be called \[my\] wife; because she was taken from her
husband." <span id="fr_126"></span>[3](#fn_126.md) 7. Therefore shall man
and wife be one, and therefore shall a man leave his father and his
mother, and cleave unto his wife, and they shall be one flesh. <span
id="fr_127"></span>[4](#fn_127.md) 8. In the first week was Adam created,
and the rib--his wife: in the second week He showed her unto him: and
for this reason the commandment was given to keep in their defilement,
for a male seven days, and for a female twice seven days. <span
id="fr_128"></span>[5](#fn_128.md) 9. And after Adam had completed forty
days in the land where he had been created, we brought him into the
Garden of Eden to till and keep it, but his wife they brought in on the
eightieth day, and after this she entered into the Garden of Eden. 10.
And for this reason the commandment is written on the heavenly
tables <span id="fr_129"></span>[6](#fn_129.md) in

<span id="page_48">p. 48</span>

regard to her that giveth birth: "if she beareth a male, she shall
remain in her uncleanness seven days according to the first week of
days, and thirty and three days shall she remain in the blood of her
purifying, and she shall not touch any hallowed thing, nor enter into
the sanctuary, until she accomplisheth these days which (are enjoined)
in the case of a male child. 11. But in the case of a female child she
shall remain in her uncleanness two weeks of days, according to the
first two weeks, and sixty-six days in the blood of her purification,
and they will be in all eighty days." 12. And when she had completed
these eighty days we brought her into the Garden of Eden, for it is
holier than all the earth besides, and every tree that is planted in it
is holy. 13. Therefore, there was ordained regarding her who beareth a
male or a female child the statute of those days that she should touch
no hallowed thing, nor enter into the sanctuary until these days for the
male or female child are accomplished. 14. This is the law and testimony
which was written down for Israel, in order that they should observe
(it) all the days. 15. And in the first week

of the first jubilee, Adam and his wife were in the Garden of Eden for
seven <span id="fr_130"></span>[1](#fn_130.md) years tilling and keeping
it, and we gave him work and we instructed him to do everything that is
suitable for tillage. <span id="fr_131"></span>[2](#fn_131.md) 16. And he
tilled (the garden), and was naked and knew it not, and was not
ashamed, <span id="fr_132"></span>[3](#fn_132.md) and he protected the
garden from the birds and beasts and cattle, and gathered

<span id="page_49">p. 49</span>

its fruit, and ate, and put aside the residue for himself and for his
wife \[and put aside that which was being kept\]. <span
id="fr_133"></span>[1](#fn_133.md) 17. <span
id="fr_134"></span>[2](#fn_134.md) And after the completion of the seven
years, which he had completed there, seven years exactly, and in the
second month, on the seventeenth

day (of the month), the serpent came and approached the woman, and the
serpent said to the woman, "Hath God commanded you, saying, Ye shall not
eat of every tree of the garden?" 18. And she said to it, "Of all the
fruit of the trees of the garden God hath said unto us, Eat; but of the
fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden God hath said unto
us, Ye shall not eat thereof, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die."
19. And the serpent said unto the woman, "Ye shall not surely die: for
God doth know that on the day ye shall eat thereof, your eyes will be
opened, and ye will be as gods, and ye will know good and evil." 20. And
the woman saw the tree that it was agreeable and pleasant to the eye,
and that its fruit was good for food, and she took thereof and ate. 21.
And when she had first covered her shame with fig-leaves, she gave
thereof to Adam and he ate, and his eyes were opened, and he saw that he
was naked. 22. And he took fig-leaves and sewed (them) together, and
made an apron for himself, and covered his shame. 32. And God cursed the
serpent, and was wroth with it for ever. . . . <span
id="fr_135"></span>[3](#fn_135.md) 24. And He was wroth with the woman,
because she hearkened to the voice of the serpent, and did eat; and He
said unto her: <span id="fr_136"></span>[4](#fn_136.md) I shall greatly
multiply thy sorrow and thy pains in sorrow thou shalt bring forth
children, and thy return <span id="fr_137"></span>[5](#fn_137.md) shall be
unto thy husband, and he will rule over thee." 25.

<span id="page_50">p. 50</span>

\[paragraph continues\] And to Adam also He said, "Because thou hast
hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree of
which I commanded thee that thou shouldst not eat thereof, cursed be the
ground for thy sake: thorns and thistles shall it bring forth to thee,
and thou shalt eat thy bread in the sweat of thy face, till thou
returnest to the earth from whence thou wast taken; for earth thou art,
and unto earth shalt thou return." 26. And He made for them coats of
skin, and clothed them, and sent them forth from the Garden of
Eden. <span id="fr_138"></span>[1](#fn_138.md) 27. And on that day on which
Adam went forth from the garden, he offered as a sweet savour an
offering, frankincense, galbanum, and stacte, and spices <span
id="fr_139"></span>[2](#fn_139.md) in the morning with the rising of the
sun from the day when he covered his shame. 28. And on that day was
closed the mouth of all beasts, and of cattle, and of birds, and of
whatever walketh, and of whatever moveth, so that they could no longer
speak: <span id="fr_140"></span>[3](#fn_140.md) for they had all spoken one
with another with one lip and with one tongue. 29. And He sent out of
the Garden of Eden all flesh that was in the Garden of Eden, and all
flesh was scattered according to its kinds, and according to its types
unto the places which had been created for them. 30. And to Adam alone
did He give (the wherewithal) to cover his shame, of all the beasts and
cattle. 31. On this account, it is prescribed on the heavenly tables as
touching all those who know the judgment of the law, that they should
cover their shame, and should not uncover themselves as the Gentiles
uncover

themselves. <span id="fr_141"></span>[4](#fn_141.md) 32. And on the new
moon of the fourth month, Adam and his wife went forth from the Garden

<span id="page_51">p. 51</span>

of Eden, and they dwelt in the land of ’Eldâ, <span
id="fr_142"></span>[1](#fn_142.md) in the land of their creation. 33. And
Adam called the name of his wife Eve. 34. And they had no son till the
first jubilee, and after this he knew her. 35. Now he tilled the land as
he had been instructed in the Garden of Eden. <span

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_123"></span>[46:5](jub15.htm#fr_123.md) Cf. Gen. ii. 19.

<span id="fn_124"></span>[47:1](jub15.htm#fr_124.md) Cf. Gen. ii. 20.

<span id="fn_125"></span>[47:2](jub15.htm#fr_125.md) Cf. Gen. ii. 18; LXX
and Vulg. have pl. ("let *us* make" ), but MT Sam. Syr., "I will make."

<span id="fn_126"></span>[47:3](jub15.htm#fr_126.md) Cf. Gen. ii. 21-23.
According to the Talmud, Adam was originally (as first created, Gen. i.
27) hermaphroditic.

<span id="fn_127"></span>[47:4](jub15.htm#fr_127.md) Cf. Gen. ii. 24.

<span id="fn_128"></span>[47:5](jub15.htm#fr_128.md) For these laws cf.
Lev. xii. 2-5, according to which in the one case the mother was not to
enter the sanctuary till the lapse of forty days, in the other eighty
days. The reason for this is given in the following section (9),
according to the author of *Jubilees*. This peculiar idea recurs
elsewhere (Philo, *Book of Adam and Eve*), but not in Rabbinic
literature, except for some slight traces. See Charles, *ad loc.*

<span id="fn_129"></span>[47:6](jub15.htm#fr_129.md) Cf. 1 Enoch lxxxi. 1,
2, xciii. 2, ciii. 2; the expression also occurs in *Test. XII.
Patriarchs*. In our Book the *heavenly* <span id="page_48">p. 48</span>
*tables* are conceived of as the divine statute book of which the Mosaic
Law is the earthly reproduction; but they also contain records of events
and predictions. The underlying idea is predestinarian.

<span id="fn_130"></span>[48:1](jub15.htm#fr_130.md) According to *Ber.
rabba* xviii., *Sanh.* 38b, Adam was only six hours in the Garden; cf.
*Pirḳe de R. Eliezer* xviii. (Adam entered the garden at the seventh
hour and was driven forth at twilight, *i. e.* the twelfth hour on
Friday the eve of the Sabbath).

<span id="fn_131"></span>[48:2](jub15.htm#fr_131.md) Agriculture is a
divine institution. Here the instruction is given by angels; contrast
Isa. xxviii. 26-29. See also 4 Ezra vi. 42. *Test. XII. Patr.* Issachar
iii.

<span id="fn_132"></span>[48:3](jub15.htm#fr_132.md) Cf. Gen. ii. 25.

<span id="fn_133"></span>[49:1](jub15.htm#fr_133.md) The bracketed words
are a dittograph.

<span id="fn_134"></span>[49:2](jub15.htm#fr_134.md) For 17-22 cf. Gen.
iii. 1-7.

<span id="fn_135"></span>[49:3](jub15.htm#fr_135.md) Charles suspects a
lacuna here. It may have contained a statement to the effect that the
serpent's four feet, which it is supposed to have originally possessed,
were cut off. Cf. Targ. Ps.-Jon. on Gen. iii. 14, and Josephus, *Ant.*
i. 1, 4.

<span id="fn_136"></span>[49:4](jub15.htm#fr_136.md) Cf. Gen. iii. M.

<span id="fn_137"></span>[49:5](jub15.htm#fr_137.md) So LXX and Syr. (ἡ
ἀποστραφή σου), MT, "thy desire."

<span id="fn_138"></span>[50:1](jub15.htm#fr_138.md) Cf. Gen. ii. 17-19,
21, 24.

<span id="fn_139"></span>[50:2](jub15.htm#fr_139.md) *i. e.* the
incense-offering of Exod. xxx. 34.

<span id="fn_140"></span>[50:3](jub15.htm#fr_140.md) For this belief cf.
Josephus, *Ant.* i. 1, 4. The idea underlying the text here is that up
to this time both men and animals spoke Hebrew, which was the universal
language till the building of the Tower of Babel.

<span id="fn_141"></span>[50:4](jub15.htm#fr_141.md) A protest against the
Greek custom of exposing the person in public athletic sports; cf. 1
Macc. i. 13 f.; 2 Macc. iv. 9-14; Josephus, *Ant.* xii. 5, 1.

<span id="fn_142"></span>[51:1](jub15.htm#fr_142.md) Charles suggests that
*’Eldâ* may be a corruption of the Hebrew word meaning "nativity" (land
of "nativity").

<span id="fn_143"></span>[51:2](jub15.htm#fr_143.md) Cf. iii. 15.
