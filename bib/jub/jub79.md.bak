### The Two Journeys of the Sons of Jacob to Egypt (xlii. 1-25; cf. Gen. xlii., xliii.).

XLII\. And in the first year of the third week of

the forty-fifth jubilee the famine began to come into the land, and the
rain refused to be given to the earth, for none whatever fell. 2. And
the earth grew barren, but in the land of Egypt there was food, for
Joseph had gathered the seed of the land in the seven years of plenty
and had preserved it. <span id="fr_863"></span>[4](#fn_855.md) 3 . And the
Egyptians came to Joseph that he might give them food, and he opened the
storehouses where was the grain of the first year, and he sold it to the
people of the land for gold. <span id="fr_864"></span>[5](#fn_856.md) 4.
(Now the famine was very sore in the land of Canaan), and Jacob heard
that there

<span id="page_192">p. 192</span>

was food in Egypt, and he sent his ten sons that they should procure
food for him in Egypt; but Benjamin he did not send, and (the ten sons
of Jacob) arrived (in Egypt) among those that went (there.) 5. And
Joseph recognized them, but they did not recognize him, and he spake
unto them and questioned them, and he said unto them: "Are ye not spies,
and have ye not come to explore the approaches of the land?" And he put
them in ward. 6. And after that he set them free again, and detained
Simeon alone and sent off his nine brothers. 7. And he filled their
sacks with corn, and he put their gold in their sacks, and they did not
know. 8. And he commanded them to bring their younger brother, for they
had told him their father was living and their younger brother. 9. And
they went up from the land of Egypt and they came to the land of Canaan;
and they told their father all that had befallen them, and how the lord
of the country had spoken roughly to them, and had seized Simeon till
they should bring Benjamin. 10. And Jacob said: "Me have ye bereaved of
my children! Joseph is not and Simeon also is not, and ye will take
Benjamin away. On me hath your wickedness come." <span
id="fr_865"></span>[1](#fn_857.md) 11. And he said: "My son will not go
down with you lest perchance he fall sick; for their mother gave birth
to two sons, and one hath perished, and this one also ye will take from
me. If perchance he took a fever on the road, <span
id="fr_866"></span>[2](#fn_858.md) ye would bring down my old age with
sorrow unto death." 12. For he saw that their money had been returned to
every man in his sack, and for this reason he feared to send him. 13.
And the famine increased and became sore in the land of Canaan, and in
all lands save in the land of Egypt, for many of the children of the
Egyptians had stored up their seed for food from the time when they saw
Joseph gathering seed together

<span id="page_193">p. 193</span>

and putting it in storehouses and preserving it for the years of famine.
14. And the people of Egypt fed themselves thereon during the first year
of their famine. 15. But when Israel saw that the famine was very sore
in the land, and there was no deliverance, he said unto his sons: "Go
again, and procure food for us that we die not." 16. And they said: "We
shall not go; unless our youngest brother go with us, we shall not go."
17. And Israel saw that if he did not send him with them, they should
all perish by reason of the famine. 18. And Reuben said: "Give him into
my hand, and if I do not bring him back to thee, slay my two sons
instead of his soul." And he said unto him He will not go with thee."
19. And Judah came near and said: "Send him with me, and if I do not
bring him back to thee, let me bear the blame before thee all the days
of my life." 20. And he sent him with them in the second year of this

week on the first day of the month, and they came to the land of Egypt
with all those who went, and (they had) presents in their hands, stacte
and almonds and terebinth nuts and pure honey. 21. And they went and
stood before Joseph, and he saw Benjamin his brother, and he knew him,
and said unto them: "Is this your youngest brother?" And they said unto
him: "It is he." And he said: "The Lord be gracious to thee, my son!"
22. And he sent him into his house and he brought forth Simeon unto them
and he made a feast for them, and they presented to him the gift which
they had brought in their hands. 23. And they ate before him and he gave
them all a portion, but the portion of Benjamin was seven times larger
than that of any of theirs. 24. And they ate and drank and arose and
remained with their asses. 25. And Joseph devised a plan whereby he
might learn their thoughts as to whether thoughts of peace prevailed
amongst them, and he said to the steward who was over his house: "Fill
all their sacks with food, and return their money unto them into their
vessels, and my cup, the silver cup out of which I

<span id="page_194">p. 194</span>

drink, put it in the sack of the youngest, and send them away." <span
