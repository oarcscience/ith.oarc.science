### The Dwelling-places of the Ishmaelites and of the Sons of Keturah (xx. 12-13).

12\. And Ishmael and his sons, and the sons of Keturah and their sons,
went together and dwelt from Paran to the entering in of Babylon in all
the land which is towards the East facing the desert. 13. And these
mingled with each other, and their name was called Arabs, and
Ishmaelites.
