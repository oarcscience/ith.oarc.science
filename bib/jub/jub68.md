XXXIV\. And in the sixth year of this week of this

forty-fourth jubilee Jacob sent his sons to pasture their sheep, and his
servants with them, to the pastures of Shechem. 2. <span
id="fr_771"></span>[2](#fn_767.md) And the seven kings of the Amorites
assembled themselves together against them, to slay them, hiding
themselves under the trees, and to take their cattle as a prey. 3. And
Jacob and Levi and Judah and Joseph were in the house with Isaac their
father; for his spirit was sorrowful, and they could not leave him: and
Benjamin was the youngest, and for this reason remained with his father.
4. And there came the king\[s\] <span id="fr_772"></span>[3](#fn_768.md) of
Tâphû, <span id="fr_773"></span>[4](#fn_769.md)

<span id="page_170">p. 170</span>

and the king\[s\] <span id="fr_774"></span>[1](#fn_770.md) of
†’Arêsa,† <span id="fr_775"></span>[2](#fn_771.md) and the king\[s\] <span
id="fr_776"></span>[1](#fn_770.md) of Sêragân, <span
id="fr_777"></span>[3](#fn_772.md) and the king\[s\] <span
id="fr_778"></span>[1](#fn_770.md) of Sêlô, <span
id="fr_779"></span>[4](#fn_773.md) and the king\[s\] <span
id="fr_780"></span>[1](#fn_770.md) of Gâ’as, <span
id="fr_781"></span>[5](#fn_774.md) and the king of Bêthôrôn, <span
id="fr_782"></span>[6](#fn_775.md) and the king of †Ma’anîsâkîr,† <span
id="fr_783"></span>[7](#fn_776.md) and all those who dwell in these
mountains (and) who dwell in the woods in the land of Canaan. 5. And
they announced this to Jacob saying: "Behold, the kings of the Amorites
have surrounded thy sons, and plundered their herds." 6. And he arose
from his housel he and his three sons and all the servants of his
father, and his own servants, and he went against them with six
thousand <span id="fr_784"></span>[8](#fn_777.md) men, who carried swords.
7. And he slew them in the pastures of Shechem, and pursued those who
fled, and he slew them with the edge of the sword, and he slew <span
id="fr_785"></span>[9](#fn_778.md) †’Arêsa † and Tâphû and Sarêgân and Sêlô
and †’Amânîsakîr† and Gâ\[gâ\]’as, and he recovered his herds. 8. And he
prevailed over them, and imposed tribute on them that they should pay
him tribute, five fruit products of their land, and he built Rôbêl <span
id="fr_786"></span>[10](#fn_779.md) and Tamnâtârês <span
id="fr_787"></span>[11](#fn_780.md) 9. And he returned in peace, and made
peace with them, and they became his servants, until the day that he and
his sons went down into

Egypt. 10. <span id="fr_788"></span>[12](#fn_781.md) And in the seventh
year of this week he sent Joseph to learn about the welfare of his
brothers from his house to the land of Shechem, and he found them in the
land of Dothan. 11. And they dealt treacherously with him, and formed a
plot against him to slay him, but changing their minds,

<span id="page_171">p. 171</span>

they sold him to Ishmaelite merchants, and they brought him down into
Egypt, and they sold him to Potiphar, the eunuch <span
id="fr_789"></span>[1](#fn_782.md) of Pharaoh, the chief of the
cooks, <span id="fr_790"></span>[2](#fn_783.md) priest of the city of
’Êlêw. <span id="fr_791"></span>[3](#fn_784.md) 12. And the sons of Jacob
slaughtered a kid, and dipped the coat of Joseph in the blood, and sent
(it) to Jacob their father on the tenth of the seventh month. 13. And he
mourned all that night, for they had brought it to him in the evening,
and he became feverish with mourning for his death, and he said: "An
evil beast hath devoured Joseph"; and all the members of his house
\[mourned with him that day, and they\] <span
id="fr_792"></span>[4](#fn_785.md) were grieving and mourning with him all
that day. 14. And his sons and his daughter rose up to comfort him, but
he refused to be comforted for his son. 15. And on that day Bilhah heard
that Joseph had perished, and she died mourning him, and she was living
in †Qafrâtêf† <span id="fr_793"></span>[5](#fn_786.md) and Dinah also, his
daughter, died after Joseph had perished. And there came these three
mournings upon Israel in one month. 16. And they buried Bilhah over
against the tomb of Rachel, and Dinah also, his daughter, they buried
there. 17. And he mourned for Joseph one year, and did not cease, for he
said "Let me go down to the grave mourning for my son." <span
id="fr_794"></span>[6](#fn_787.md) 18. For this reason <span
id="fr_795"></span>[7](#fn_788.md) it is ordained for the children of
Israel that they should afflict themselves <span
id="fr_796"></span>[8](#fn_789.md) on the tenth of the seventh month--on
the day that the news which made him weep for Joseph came to Jacob his
father--that they should make atonement for themselves thereon with a
young goat on the tenth of the seventh month,

<span id="page_172">p. 172</span>

once a year, for their sins; for they had grieved the affection of their
father regarding Joseph his son. 19. And this day hath been ordained
that they should grieve thereon for their sins, and for all their
transgressions and for all their errors, so that they might cleanse
themselves on that day once a year.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_767"></span>[169:2](jub68.htm#fr_771.md) The account given in
2-8 of the conquest of Shechem is given in a fuller form in the *Test.
Judah* iii-vii., and in the Midrash Wajjissau (cf. Gaster, *Chronicles
of Jerahmeel*, pp. 80-87). The legend evidently has an old basis, for it
harmonizes with the statement given in Gen. xlviii. 22, which refers to
Jacob's conquest of Shechem (cf. RX. margin). This form of the story is
obviously independent of, and possibly older than, that given in Gen.
xxxiv.

<span id="fn_768"></span>[169:3](jub68.htm#fr_772.md) Read "king."

<span id="fn_769"></span>[169:4](jub68.htm#fr_773.md) = Tappuah (Josh. xv.
53, xvi. 8). It is the Tephon mentioned in 1 Macc. ix. 50. This and the
following places mentioned may have been specially interesting to our
author because of events connected with them in Maccabean times.

<span id="fn_770"></span>[170:1](jub68.htm#fr_780.md) Read "king."

<span id="fn_771"></span>[170:2](jub68.htm#fr_775.md) Read "Asor," *i. e.*
Hazer, the scene of a great victory by Jonathan, 1 Macc. xi. 67 ff.

<span id="fn_772"></span>[170:3](jub68.htm#fr_777.md) Unknown.

<span id="fn_773"></span>[170:4](jub68.htm#fr_779.md) *i. e.* Shiloh.

<span id="fn_774"></span>[170:5](jub68.htm#fr_781.md) =? Gaash (Josh. xxiv.
30).

<span id="fn_775"></span>[170:6](jub68.htm#fr_782.md) The scene of more
than one Maccabean victory; cf. 1 Macc. iii. 13 ff vii. 39 ff.

<span id="fn_776"></span>[170:7](jub68.htm#fr_783.md) Corrupt for
Shakir-Maani."

<span id="fn_777"></span>[170:8](jub68.htm#fr_784.md) Another reading is
"800."

<span id="fn_778"></span>[170:9](jub68.htm#fr_785.md) Six out of the seven
kings are slain; so *Test. Judah* iv. \[For the names see notes on 4
above.\]

<span id="fn_779"></span>[170:10](jub68.htm#fr_786.md) Perhaps corrupt for
"Arbael" = Arbela (1 Macc. ix. 2).

<span id="fn_780"></span>[170:11](jub68.htm#fr_787.md) = *Timnath-heres*
(Jud. ii. 9); cf. 1 Macc. ix. 50.

<span id="fn_781"></span>[170:12](jub68.htm#fr_788.md) For 10-11 cf. Gen.
xxxvii. 12 ff.

<span id="fn_782"></span>[171:1](jub68.htm#fr_789.md) Or "court official."

<span id="fn_783"></span>[171:2](jub68.htm#fr_790.md) So LXX of Gen.
xxxvii. 36 (ἀρχιμάγειρος), misunderstanding the Hebrew (= "captain of
the guard").

<span id="fn_784"></span>[171:3](jub68.htm#fr_791.md) *i. e.* Heliopolis
(LXX Ἡλίου πόλεωσ, Gen. xli. 45, 50), *i. e.* "On."

<span id="fn_785"></span>[171:4](jub68.htm#fr_792.md) Bracketed as a
dittograph.

<span id="fn_786"></span>[171:5](jub68.htm#fr_793.md) ? = "Kabrâtân,"
xxxii. 32.

<span id="fn_787"></span>[171:6](jub68.htm#fr_794.md) Cf. Gen. xxxvii. 35.

<span id="fn_788"></span>[171:7](jub68.htm#fr_795.md) The reason here given
for the institution of the Day of Atonement (cf. Lev. xvi.) seems to be
peculiar to our Book.

<span id="fn_789"></span>[171:8](jub68.htm#fr_796.md) = "fast," cf. Lev.
xvi. 31, etc.
