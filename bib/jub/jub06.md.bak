### THE SPECIAL AIMS AND GENERAL CHARACTER OF THE BOOK

It is obvious that *Jubilees* is dominated by certain interests and
antipathies. It is to a large extent polemical in character, and its
author desires at once to protest against certain tendencies which, in
his view, threaten true religion, and to inculcate certain reforms.
Incidentally it commends certain religious practices, and endeavours to
invest them with enhanced sanctions. In the forefront, as its name ("the
Book of Jubilees") suggests <span id="fr_9"></span>[2](#fn_9.md) stands the
question of the Calendar. It is all important in the author's view that
the divinely ordained principle according to which history is divided up
by year-weeks (*i. e.* periods of 7 years) and jubilees (*i. e.* periods
of 7 X 7 years) is recognized (Cf. i. 26 f.). Accordingly, he gives a
history from Creation to Moses, in which the sequence of events is
recorded and dated exactly

<span id="page_xvi">p. xvi</span>

by jubilee-periods, or portions of such. This leads up to a final
section in which the law respecting jubilees and sabbatical years is
solemnly enjoined. The writer's aim seems to have been nothing less than
a reformation of the Jewish Calendar. The prevailing system has led to
the nation "forgetting" new moons, festivals, and sabbaths (and (?)
jubilees); <span id="fr_10"></span>[1](#fn_10.md) in other words, it has
produced grave irregularities in the observance of matters which were of
divine obligation.

A cardinal feature of the writer's system is the jubilee-period, which
consists of 7 X 7 (*i. e.* 49) years. Here we are confronted with a
difficulty. The passage in Lev. (xxv. 8-14) which ordains the observance
of the jubilee-year expressly identifies this, in the present form of
the text, with the fiftieth year (Lev. xxv. 10 and 11). But it is
incredible that the author of our Book would deliberately have violated
the express injunctions of the Pentateuch on such a matter, and we are
driven to conclude that he had a text before him in which the word
"fiftieth" was absent. <span id="fr_11"></span>[2](#fn_11.md) The wording
of verses 8 and 9 is ambiguous, and allows of the explanation that the
jubilee-year was the forty-ninth and not the fiftieth. It is quite
possible that in verses 10 and 11 "fiftieth" has been added to the text,
in the interests of the rival explanation that ultimately prevailed,
for, as has been pointed out already, our Book presupposes a text of the
Pentateuch that is independent of and earlier than M.T. This explanation
suffers from the difficulty that the LXX and other ancient versions
(including the Samaritan text) support the currently received reading.
But it is not improbable that on such a matter the influence of Orthodox
views may have operated to bring their text of the verses into harmony
with the currently accepted theory. <span id="fr_12"></span>[3](#fn_12.md)

<span id="page_xvii">p. xvii</span>

But more revolutionary is the writer's advocacy of a solar calendar. In
ii. 9 he says, "God appointed the sun to be a great sign upon the earth
for days and for sabbaths, and for feasts and for years and for jubilees
and for all seasons of the years." In Gen. i. 14 this function is
assigned to the sun *and the moon*; but in our Book the moon is
deliberately excluded. The writer objected fiercely to the traditional
calendar which was based upon the changes of the moon, and was adjusted
to the solar year by means of intercalation. How can his apparent
violation of the express wording of Scripture be explained? His answer
would probably have been that the solar year of 364 days (cf. vi. 32)
was actually the system implied in the Pentateuch. It has been pointed
out by Bacon <span id="fr_13"></span>[1](#fn_13.md) that in the P sections
of the Flood-narrative in Genesis a year of 364 days is pre-supposed. It
is said that the Flood began on the 17th day of the second month, and
ended on the 27th day of the second month the following year, *i. e.*
reckoning by the ordinary lunar months, 12 months (= 12 X 29½ days) or
354 days + 10 days (to make up the solar year), or 364 days in all, this
completing the one whole year which, according to the Babylonian source,
was the length of the Flood's duration. Thus the author of *Jubilees*
had a dogmatic basis within the text of the Pentateuch itself for his
view that the true year was a solar one of 364 days. He may very well
have believed that whatever may be the exact significance of Gen. i. 14,
it could not override this fact. It is interesting to notice that this
tradition of a solar year of 364 days should be implicit in the P
sections of Genesis. There are strong reasons for believing that the
author of *Jubilees* was a priest, and, as such, may have been
acquainted in some special way with this priestly tradition. There are,
however, difficulties in connexion with the reckoning of such a solar
year. It is obvious that a year of 12 months, each

<span id="page_xviii">p. xviii</span>

of which contains 30 days, will only yield a total of 360 days. It has
been supposed that our author overcame this difficulty by inserting one
intercalary day at the beginning of each quarter. Thus each three months
would contain 31 + 30 + 30 (= 91) days. But this solution will not
harmonize with the date assigned by our author to the Feast of Weeks,
which is the "middle" of the third month (xvi. 13). Scholars are agreed
that the 15th of Sivan is meant. Now the Feast of Weeks was to be
celebrated on the fiftieth day, counting from the "morrow" after the
Sabbath of Passover (Lev. xxiii. 15 f.) . The Pharisees, as is well
known, interpreted "Sabbath" here to be the first day of the Feast
(Nisan 15th), whatever the day of the week on which it fell, and
reckoned from Nisan 16th, which would bring the Feast of Weeks to Sivan
6th. Another view, with which our Book agrees, interpreted "sabbath" as
= "week" (as in fact it has this meaning throughout the rest of the
verse). Then render: *And ye shall count unto you from the morrow after
the* (*festival*) *week, from the day that ye bring the wave-sheaf,
seven complete weeks shall there be, until the morrow after the seventh
week ye shall number fifty days*: the festival-week would be Nisan
15-21, and its "morrow" Nisan 22; reckoning 28 days to the month, this
would leave 6 days in Nisan + 28 days in Iyar + 15 in Sivan = 49 +Nisan
22 = 50 (lays. This seems to have been the reckoning of our author.
Moreover, since the year he advocates contains 364 days, the festivals
would always fall upon the same day of the week, and as Nisan 1st the
first day of Creation fell, according to his scheme, on the first day of
the week, *i. e.* Sunday, it must always fall on that day; thus Nisan
14th and 21st would always fall on a Sabbath, while Nisan 22nd and Sivan
15th would always fall on a Sunday. To make the Feast of Weeks fall on
the 1st day of the week was a Sadducean practice, and one that it is
inconceivable that any Pharisee can ever have sanctioned or tolerated.
It will be noticed, however,

<span id="page_xix">p. xix</span>

that the view of our author, according to which the Feast of Weeks falls
on Sivan 15th, implies a reckoning of 28 days to the months Nisan and
Iyar. How is this to be reconciled with a solar year of 12 months?
Eppstein supposes that our author used two reckonings, one for the civil
year of 12 months, 8 of 30, and 4 of 31 days, and an ecclesiastical year
of 13 months each containing 28 days. But it is difficult to believe
that the writer used two systems side by side. A better solution would
be that he added a week to every third month, which would make each 3
months consist of 28 + 28 + 35 days (total 91 days), or 4 + 4 + 5 weeks.
It is evident that his calendar-system is based upon the number 7; thus
each month consists of 4 X 7 (or 5 X 7) days, while the year consists of
52 X 7 days, the year-week of 7 years, and the jubilee of 7 X 7 years.
On this reckoning the Feast of Weeks would still fall on the 15th of
Sivan, but the 15th would not strictly be the "middle" of that month,
which, *ex hypothesi*, consisted of 35 days. It might, however, be used
loosely for such a date. Perhaps, too, the author desired to avoid
specifying more particularly this date, because current Sadducean
practice (based upon 4 different length of days assigned to the months)
would not quite harmonize with it. <span id="fr_14"></span>[1](#fn_14.md)
With regard to the Passover, it is noticeable that our author interprets
the phrase "between the two evenings" (at which time the Passover lamb
was to be slain, cf. Exod. xii. 6; Lev. xxiii. 5) to mean the third part
of the day (xlix. 10); *i. e.* assuming the day to contain 12 hours, we
may fix the third part as from 2 to 6 p.m. This, again, contradicts
Pharisaic practice. Notable, too, is the mention of wine in connexion
with the Passover: *All Israel* \[*i. e.* in Egypt\] *was eating the
flesh* 

<span id="page_xx">p. xx</span>

*of the Paschal lamb and drinking the wine* (xlix. 6). Now this was a
Pharisaic custom in later times, and has no basis, apparently, in the
canonical account in Exodus. In view, however, of the fact that our
author usually follows the prescriptions of Scripture with scrupulous
care, the question arises whether he did not, in fact, derive this from
the Pentateuch. Leszyrisky suggests <span id="fr_15"></span>[1](#fn_15.md)
that the word rendered "bitter herbs" in Exod. xii. 8 ("with bitter
herbs shall they eat it") was interpreted by our author to mean
"wine"--the word simply means "bitter," or "what is poisonous," and a
cognate form is used in connexion with wine in Deut. xxxii. 32. It is
certainly curious that our author makes no mention of "bitter herbs" in
connexion with the Egyptian Passover.

The Feast of Tabernacles, too, as described in our Book (xvi. 10-31),
has certain peculiar features. In particular, the specifically Pharisaic
custom of pouring water on the altar <span id="fr_16"></span>[2](#fn_16.md)
at the Feast is not mentioned or recognized. Now as early as the time of
Alexander Jannæus (102-76 B.C.) the Pharisees tried to enforce the
adoption of this custom upon the Sadducean priest-king, who, to show his
contempt, allowed the water, which should have been poured solemnly on
the altar, to run over his feet. The protest that ensued was followed
later by a massacre of Pharisees. It is difficult to believe that our
author, a few years earlier, if he was himself a Pharisee, could have
been ignorant of this custom, which was based upon old popular
tradition. His silence concerning it is much more probably deliberate.
The custom was objectionable, from the Sadducean standpoint, because it
had no basis in the written Law. The custom of wearing wreaths upon the
head which is here prescribed (xvi. 30) is also unknown to tradition;
nor has it, apparently, any Scriptural basis, unless it was inferred as
an act of rejoicing, from the words "and ye shall rejoice before the
Lord your God seven days" (Lev. xxiii. 40), taken in conjunction with
the

<span id="page_xxi">p. xxi</span>

command (in the preceding clause) to take "branches of palm trees, and
boughs of thick trees, and willows of the brook." Wearing a wreath of
palm-leaves may have been regarded as one of the ways in which this
command was to be fulfilled.

Even more striking are the sections which give directions about the
observance of the Sabbath (l. 1-13; cf. ii. 29-30). These directions are
very severe. The following actions are prohibited on the Sabbath under
penalty of death: travelling by land or sea, buying or selling, drawing
water, carrying burdens out of the house, killing or striking, snaring
beasts, birds or fish, fasting or making war, marital intercourse. The
last prescription is in direct opposition to Pharisaic practice, as is
also the severe penalty imposed for non-observance of the various
prescriptions. It is interesting to notice that these agree with the
practice still maintained by the Falashas, Samaritans, and Ḳaraite Jews.
Probably this rigid view of sabbath-observance was cherished in
specially pious priestly circles at the time when our author wrote. In
this connexion it may be noted that our Book, in its interpretation of
the law about the fruit of newly-planted trees given in Lev. xix. 23-24,
agrees with the view of the Samaritans and Ḳaraite Jews in directing
that the first fruits of the fruit of the fourth year should be offered
on the altar, and what remained given to the priests. According to
Pharisaic practice what remained was to be eaten by the owners within
the walls of Jerusalem.

Another point in which *Jubilees* upholds a view which is certainly not
Pharisaic is on the question of the law of retribution, the so-called
*lex talionis*. It is well known that while the Sadducees insisted on
the strict letter of the Law, "an eye for an eye, and a tooth for a
tooth," the Pharisees strove to mitigate its harshness by the
substitution (except in the case of murder) of compensating
money-payments. Moreover, the Mishna directs that where the
death-penalty is inflicted it is to be carried out by the

<span id="page_xxii">p. xxii</span>

sword (cf. *Sanhedrin* ix. i: "These are to be beheaded"). Our Book,
however, seems to wage a polemic against such views in no uncertain
language:

*Take no gifts for the blood of man, <span id="fr_17"></span>[1](#fn_17.md)
lest it be shed with impunity, without judgement; for it is the blood
that is shed that causes the earth to sin, and the earth cannot be
cleansed from the blood of man save by the blood of him who shed it. And
take no present or gift for the blood of man; blood for blood* (xxi. 19
f.).

In iv. 31 f. the circumstances of Cain's death are described: *his house
fell upon him and he died in the midst of his house; for with a stone he
had killed Abel, and by a stone was he killed in righteous judgement.
For this reason it was ordained on the heavenly tables: "With the
instrument with which a man kills his neighbour, with the same shall he
be killed; after the manner that he wounded him, in like manner shall
they deal with him*."

It is true that a school of Pharisees (the School of Shammai) still, to
some extent, upheld, in theory at any rate, the severer and older view.
But this does not alter the fact that it was a distinctive tenet of the
Sadducees; and it is difficult to believe that any Pharisee can, at any
time, have used such unqualified language as that employed in the
extracts given above. <span id="fr_18"></span>[2](#fn_18.md)

At this point we may well ask what was the author's attitude towards the
belief in a future life? At the time when he wrote the doctrine of the
resurrection of the body had become well established in certain Jewish
circles. In the Book of Daniel it had received classical expression. It
was a cherished belief of the Pharisaic party. Now our Book does not in
any way accept such a belief. The one passage in which the language
employed might, at first sight, suggest a hint of such a belief is a
sentence describing the happiness of the righteous in the age of
felicity which is to dawn:

<span id="page_xxiii">p. xxiii</span>

*And at that time the Lord will heal His servants,  
And they will rise up and see great peace,  
And drive out their adversaries* (xxiii. 30).

But here there is probably no reference to the idea of a resurrection.
As Charles points out, the words "shall rise up" have here "apparently
no reference to the resurrection, and mean merely that when God heals
His servants (cf. Rev. xxii. 2) they become strong." The clause in the
preceding verse, *all their days will be days of blessing and healing*
(cf. also i. 29) renders "this view the most probable." On the other
hand, the opening words of xxiii. 31

*And their bones will rest in the earth,  
And their spirits will have much joy*,

though they are susceptible of another interpretation, may point to a
belief that the righteous dead are destined to enjoy a blessed
immortality. But it is to be noticed that no emphasis is laid on the
idea; and in any case no countenance is given to the doctrine of
resurrection. This attitude accords with the Sadducean position. What
the Sadducees maintained was that the resurrection doctrine could not be
proved from the Pentateuch. They did not assert that the personality was
annihilated at death, or deny the doctrine of immortality--indeed, it is
by no means impossible that some sections of the Sadducean party
accepted this doctrine; but in general their position towards this
question--apart from that of the bodily resurrection--was cautious and
reserved. And this certainly seems to be the attitude of our author. It
should be noted that Sheol is represented--somewhat vaguely and in
poetical passages--as a place of punishment for the wicked (vii. 29;
xxii. 22; xxiv. 31). This looks like the converse of the idea that the
righteous dead are destined to enjoy a blessed immortality. In this
connexion a word may be said about the angelology and demonology of our
Book. These are in a fairly advanced stage, and imply much the same
development as is to be seen in 1 Enoch and the *Testaments of* 

<span id="page_xxiv">p. xxiv</span>

*the XII Patriarchs*. There are three classes of angels, two of a
superior order, the angels of the presence, and the angels of
sanctification (Cf. ii. 2, 18), and, besides these, a numerous inferior
order who presided over natural phenomena (ii. 2). It is noteworthy that
the two superior orders are represented as observing the Sabbath, and as
fulfilling the prescriptions of the Law regarding circumcision, etc.;
they even observe in heaven the great festivals, such as the Feast of
Weeks (vi. 18). <span id="fr_19"></span>[1](#fn_19.md) Various activities
are assigned to the angels in connexion with mankind throughout our
Book. <span id="fr_20"></span>[2](#fn_20.md)

Over against the angelic orders there stands a well-organized demonic
kingdom, presided over by "the prince of the Mastêmâ" (cf. xvii. 16;
xlviii. 2; xviii. 9, 12, etc.). <span id="fr_21"></span>[3](#fn_21.md)
Among the Satanic beings that appear in our Book is Beliar (i. 20).

What is the attitude of our author towards the Messianic Hope? The hope
for the coming of the Messianic King who should spring from the old
Royal House of David was always cherished among the masses of the
people, and in times of unusual stress was apt to flame up in vivid
expression. The Pharisees, who themselves sprang from the ranks of the
people, were naturally influenced by this tradition, and gave literary
expression to it in the *Psalms of Solomon* (70-40 B.C.?). But at the
time when our author wrote the desire for a Messianic King of the House
of David was probably only latent. A period of national prosperity came
in during the reign of John Hyrcanus, and the people generally were well
content. It is not to be supposed, however, that the popular hope had
completely died away. It was merely quiescent. On the other hand,

<span id="page_xxv">p. xxv</span>

there was a party, which no doubt had its seat in the priesthood, and
may represent the old Sadducean party, that claimed for the priesthood
not only sacerdotal but also ruling functions: Levi's descendants are
not only to be priests, but also the civil rulers of the nation, and
this view receives expression in our Book (cf. xxxi. 15). Now it is well
known that the Pharisees objected to the double office being exercised
by one person, and when Alexander Jannæus assumed the title of "king"
this feeling broke out into open hostility. At a somewhat later time a
Pharisaic author in the *Psalms of Solomon*, looking back upon the
terrible events that followed the breakup of the Hasmonean dynasty,
evidently regards the bloody chastisement which the Jews had to endure
at that time from the hands of the Romans as the punishment inflicted on
the people for having acquiesced in the usurpation by the Hasmoneans of
the royal dignity which had been reserved for the Messianic prince of
the House of David. Especially significant in this connexion is the
promise recounted in our Book of Levi (xxxii. i): *And he abode that
night at Bethel, and Levi dreamed that they had ordained and made him
the Priest of the Most High God, him and his sons for ever*. This,
originally the title of the priest-king Melchizedek (Gen. xiv. 18), was
revived by the Maccabean princely High Priests, and there is some
evidence that in certain (? Sadducean) quarters it was expected that the
Messiah would spring from the tribe of Levi, and even from the priestly
ruling Maccabean house. <span id="fr_22"></span>[1](#fn_22.md) The one
possible reference to the hope of a Messiah from Judah in our Book
occurs in the blessing of Judah, xxxi. 18:

*A prince shall thou be, thou and one of thy sons over the sons of
Jacob*;

Here Judah is addressed, and is singled out for special honour by the
side of Levi. This was only

<span id="page_xxvi">p. xxvi</span>

natural, as the Jews derived their name from the tribe of Judah, who may
be regarded as a sort of symbol of the nation generally. But who is
meant by "one of thy sons"? Some would see in this a reference to the
expected Messiah, but if this be so it is very vague. It is much more
likely that the historic David is meant. The priestly author is
significantly silent about a Davidic Messiah. Any Messiah he may have
hoped for would, according to his view, spring from the tribe of Levi.
He does not accept the view that the Davidic dynasty is of eternal
duration, even ideally. May he not, too, have been thinking, in the
address to Judah, of Judas Maccabæus? <span
id="fr_23"></span>[1](#fn_23.md) Judas by his warlike exploits had shed a
new glory on the name "Judah." But Judas himself belonged to the
priestly family of the Hasmoneans, and it would be easy for our author
to see in him the embodiment of the glories of the tribe of Judah,
without diminishing the claims of the priestly tribe to civil as well as
sacerdotal primacy.

In the same context (xxxi. 20) two lines occur in the address to Judah
which run as follows:

*And when thou sittest on the throne of the honour of thy
righteousness,  
There will be great peace for all the seed of the sons of the beloved*.

\[paragraph continues\] The exact meaning of these words is not clear.
They can hardly refer to the expected Messiah from David's House,
because in that case the context would demand the use of the third
person, whereas the second person is employed and Judah is being
addressed. Leszynsky suggests that here in the Hebrew original there may
be an allusion to the Sadducees, suggested by a word-play in the Hebrew
word for "righteousness" (*sedek*). But even so the sentence is not
clear. Is our author still thinking of Judas Maccabæus? If so, he may
mean "and when thou (Judas), in the person of thy High-Priestly
successors, sittest as Priest-king on thy Sadducean

<span id="page_xxvii">p. xxvii</span>

throne of honour." It must be admitted that this is not very convincing,
and the sentence remains obscure and uncertain in meaning. But of the
high position assigned by our author to the tribe of Levi there can be
no doubt. The lofty position of High-Priest and civil ruler is assigned
to Levi as a reward for the destruction of Shechem (cf. xxx. 17-23;
xxxii. 1-3). As Kohler says: "The Levites are represented as the keepers
of the sacred books and of the secret lore entrusted to them by the
saints from of yore (xlv. 16; cf. x. 14). This indicates that the
priests and Levites still included among themselves, as in the days of
the author of the Book of Chronicles, the men of learning, the masters
of the schools, and that these positions were not filled by men from
among the people, as was the case in the time of Shammai and Hillel."
Other features of our Book entirely accord with this. For instance, the
glorification of the Patriarchs in which our author loves to indulge is
the development of a tendency already marked in the Priestly Sections of
the Hexateuch. <span id="fr_24"></span>[1](#fn_24.md) In *Jubilees* they
become saints of the Law. Incidents which might reflect discredit upon
them (such as that described in Gen. xii. 11-13) are omitted. Abram is
represented as having known the true God from his youth (xi. 16-17; xii.
i ff.). Jacob is "a model of filial affection and obedience." A
noticeable feature is also the insistence upon the unique position of
Israel among the nations, and its rigid separation from the latter.
Circumcision is a sign of Israel's elect position (xv. 26) and a
privilege which they enjoy in common with the two chief orders of angels
(xv. 27). This is also true of the Sabbath, which the same angelic
orders observe with Israel. It is needless to add that our author
glorifies the Law, which is of heavenly origin and everlasting validity.
This is his estimate of the Law in its narrow sense, *i. e.* the
Pentateuch. It is by this criterion that he measures everything. It is
true that *Jubilees* 

<span id="page_xxviii">p. xxviii</span>

contains incidents and amplifications which are not to be found in the
written Torah. But the author is careful to base everything that is of
legal obligation upon the letter of the Law itself. Anything that he
allows himself to introduce by way of amplification or addition serves
merely to enhance the obligation of the written precept.

Finally, his eschatology is essentially that of one who is primarily
interested in the Law. In xxiii. 12-31, he introduces an apocalyptic
passage which gives a history of the Maccabean times from the
persecution of Antiochus Epiphanes to the Messianic Kingdom, the advent
of which is just at hand. A dark picture is drawn of the inroads of
Hellenism, and of its disintegrating effects upon the observance of. the
Law and the covenant (xxiii. 16-20); the warlike efforts of the
Maccabees to reclaim the Hellenizers to Judaism are then described
(xxiii. 20-22), and the cry of the nation for deliverance from its
calamities (xxiii. 23-25). Then follows a passage (xxiii. 26-32) in
which, as a consequence of Israel's renewed study of the Law, a happier
period follows. The Messianic Kingdom is to be "brought about gradually
by the progressive spiritual development of man and a corresponding
transformation of nature." Its members are "to attain to the full limit
of 1000 years in happiness and peace." Prof. Charles <span
id="fr_25"></span>[1](#fn_25.md) adds: "The writer of *Jubilees*, we can
hardly doubt thought that the era of the Messianic Kingdom had already
set in."

The important point to notice about this picture is that the dawn of the
happier Age is brought about by renewed study and observance of the Law:

*And in those days the children will begin to study the laws,  
And to seek the commandments,  
And to return to the Path of righteousness* (xxiii. 26).

The result is a gradual transformation of men and their environment.
There is no catastrophe. It is

<span id="page_xxix">p. xxix</span>

doubtful whether the author clearly envisages a final judgement, though
there may be an allusion to such, in rather vague language, in xxiii. 30
f. The tone throughout is priestly, and it can hardly be doubted that
the author was a priest.
