### Isaac curses the Philistines (xxiv. 28-33).

28\. And Isaac on that day cursed the Philistines <span
id="fr_651"></span>[1](#fn_649.md) and said: "Cursed be the Philistines
unto the day of wrath and indignation from the midst of all nations; may
God make them a derision and a curse and an object of wrath and
indignation in the hands of the sinners the Gentiles and in the hands of
the Kittim. <span id="fr_652"></span>[2](#fn_650.md) 29. And whoever
escapeth the sword of the enemy and the Kittim, may the righteous
nation <span id="fr_653"></span>[3](#fn_651.md) root out in judgment from
under heaven; for they will be the enemies and foes of my children
throughout their generations upon the earth.

30\. And no remnant will be left to them,  
Nor one that will be saved on the day of the wrath of judgment;  
For for destruction and rooting out and expulsion from the earth is the
whole seed of the Philistines (reserved),  
And there will no longer be left for these Caphtorim <span
id="fr_654"></span>[4](#fn_652.md) a name or a seed on the earth.  
31. <span id="fr_655"></span>[5](#fn_653.md) For though he ascend unto
heaven,  
Thence will he be brought down,  
And though he make himself strong on earth,  
Thence will he be dragged forth,  
And though he hide himself amongst the nations,  
Even from thence will he be rooted out;  
And though he descend into Sheol,  
There also will his condemnation be great,  
And there also he will have no peace.  
32. And if he go into captivity,  
By the hands of those that seek his life will they slay him on the way,
<span id="page_137">p. 137</span>  
And neither name nor seed will be left to him on all the earth;  
For into eternal malediction will he depart."

\[paragraph continues\] 33. And thus is it written and engraved
concerning him on the heavenly tables, to do unto him on the day of
judgment, so that he may be rooted out of the earth.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_649"></span>[136:1](jub55.htm#fr_651.md) The text reflects the
bitter feeling towards the Philistines existing among the Jews in
Maccabean times. The Philistine cities were either destroyed or captured
by the Maccabees.

<span id="fn_650"></span>[136:2](jub55.htm#fr_652.md) *i. e.* the
Macedonians; cf. 1 Macc. i. 1, viii. 5.

<span id="fn_651"></span>[136:3](jub55.htm#fr_653.md) *i. e.* Judah under
the Maccabees.

<span id="fn_652"></span>[136:4](jub55.htm#fr_654.md) The Philistines came
originally from Caphtor according to Amos ix. 7 (Deut. ii. 23; Jer.
xlvii. 4).

<span id="fn_653"></span>[136:5](jub55.htm#fr_655.md) The basis of 31-32
seems to be Amos ix. 2-4.
