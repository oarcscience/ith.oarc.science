### Joseph's Service with Potiphar; his Purity and Imprisonment (xxxix. 1-13; cf. Gen. xxxix.).

XXXIX\. And Jacob dwelt in the land of his father's sojournings in the
land of Canaan. 2. These are the generations of Jacob. And Joseph was
seventeen years old <span id="fr_844"></span>[15](#fn_836.md) when they
took him down into the land of Egypt, and Potiphar, an eunuch of
Pharaoh,

<span id="page_185">p. 185</span>

the chief cook <span id="fr_845"></span>[1](#fn_837.md) bought him. 3. And
he set Joseph over all his house, and the blessing of the Lord came upon
the house of the Egyptian on account of Joseph, and the Lord prospered
him in all that he did. 4. And the Egyptian committed everything into
the hands of Joseph; for he saw that the Lord was with him, and that the
Lord prospered him in all that he did. 5. And Joseph's appearance was
comely and very beautiful was his appearance, and his master's wife
lifted up her eyes and saw Joseph, and she loved him, and besought him
to lie with her. 6. But he did not surrender his soul, and he remembered
the Lord and the words which Jacob, his father, used to read from
amongst the words of Abraham, <span id="fr_846"></span>[2](#fn_838.md) that
no man should commit fornication with a woman who hath a husband; that
for him the punishment of death hath been ordained in the heavens before
the Most High God, and the sin will be recorded against him in the
eternal books continually before the Lord. 7. And Joseph remembered
these words and refused to lie with her. 8. And she besought him for a
year, but he refused and would not listen. 9. But she embraced him and
held him fast in the house in order to force him to lie with her, and
closed the doors of the house and held him fast; but he left his garment
in her hands and broke through the door and fled without from her
presence. 10. And the woman saw that he would not lie with her, and she
calumniated him in the presence of his lord, saying: "Thy Hebrew
servant, whom thou lovest, sought to force me so that he might lie with
me; and it came to pass when I lifted up my voice that he fled and left
his garment in my hands when I held him, and he brake through the door."
11. And the Egyptian saw the garment of Joseph and the broken door, and
heard the words of his wife, and cast Joseph into prison into the place
where the prisoners were kept whom the king imprisoned. 12. And he was
there in the prison; and the Lord gave Joseph favour in the sight of the
chief

of the prison guards and compassion before him, for he saw that the Lord
was with him, and that the Lord made all that he did to prosper. 13. And
he committed all things into his hands, and the chief of -the prison
guards knew of nothing that was with him, <span

perfected it.
