XXXIII\. (1) As this is simply to be taken as a legend, we do not care
to reconcile it with the other, which makes Abraham live in the time of
Nimrod the Wicked. According to the latter we find that Nimrod acted as
judge over him, since it is related that the whole household of
Abraham's father were idol-worshippers, moreover they made idols and
sold them in the streets. But when a man approached Abraham to sell him
an idol, he would ask him, 'How much is this image?' 'Three manas,' he
would reply. 'How old art thou?' Abraham would add. 'Thirty years.'
'Thou art thirty years of age, and yet worshippest this idol which we
made but to-day!' The man would depart and go his way. Again, another
would come to Abraham, and ask, 'How much is this idol?' 'Five manas,'
he would say. 'How old art thou?' would Abraham continue. 'Fifty years.'
'And dost thou, who art fifty years of age, bow down to this idol which
we made but to-day?' With this the man would depart and go his way.

\(2\) When Nimrod heard of Abraham's utterances, he ordered him to be
brought before him, and said, 'Thou son of Terah, make me a beautiful
god.' Abraham then entered his father's house, and said, 'Make a
beautiful image for me.' They accordingly made it, finished it, and
painted it with many colours. He went and brought it to Nimrod. \[Here
probably a lacuna in MS.\] (3) And on that day Abraham's righteousness
shone forth. It was a cloudy day, and rain fell. Therefore, when they
were about to thrust him into the burning furnace, Nimrod sat down, and
all the people of the dispersion did likewise. Abraham then entered, and
standing in the centre, he pleaded his cause. After which Nimrod asked,
'If not the gods, whom shall I serve?' Abraham replied, 'The God of gods
and Lord of lords, whose kingdom is everlasting in heaven and on earth,
and in the heavens of the high heavens.' 'I shall worship,' said Nimrod,
'the god of fire; and, behold, I shall cast thee therein. Let, then, the
God to whom thou testifiest deliver thee from the burning furnace.' (4)
They then immediately bound him strongly and tightly, and placed him on
the ground. They then surrounded him with wood on the four sides, 500
cubits thickness to the north, 500 cubits to the south, 500 to the west,
and 500 to the east. They then set the pile on fire. (5) The whole house
of Terah were worshippers of idols, and until that moment had not
recognised their Creator. Their neighbours and fellow-citizens
assembled, and, beating their heads, said to Terah, 'O shame—great
shame! thy son, of whom thou didst say that he will inherit this world
and the world to come has Nimrod burnt in the fire.' (G) Immediately
then God's mercy was moved, so that He descended from the habitation of
His glory, His greatness, His majesty, and the holiness of His great
name, and delivered Abraham, our ancestor, from that shame, from that
reproach, and from the burning furnace, as it is said, 'I am the Lord
who brought thee out of the fire of the Chaldeans'; and since a miracle
was wrought for our forefather Abraham, he and Torah were able to refute
the generation of the

is said, 'Be wise, O my son, and let my heart rejoice, and then I shall
be able to answer those who reproach me.'
