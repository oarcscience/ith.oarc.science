XXVIII\. (1) These are the generations of Noah in their lands, according
to their families, and according to their tongues. After the flood they
were spread over the earth according to their nations. The children of
Ham then went and appointed Nimrod to be a prince and a chief over them;
while the children of Japheth appointed Pinḥas to be a prince and a
chief over them. And the

children of Ham appointed for themselves Yoqtan as their prince and
chief. (2) These three chiefs came and took counsel together to assemble
all their people while Noah their father was yet alive. And all the
people accordingly drew near to them, and were as one body, and peace
reigned in the land. (3) It came to pass, 640 years after Noah went out
of the ark, that each chief numbered his people. Pinḥas numbered the
children of Japheth and the children of Gomar, and the total number of
those which Pinḥas numbered was 5,800; that of the children of Magog
under him, 6,200; that of Madai under him, 5,700; that of the children
of Tubal, 9,400; and the children of Meshech, 7,200; the children of
Riphath numbered 11,500; those of Togarmah, 14,400; those of Elishah,
14,900; of Tarshish, 12,100; of Kittim, 18,300; of Dodanim, 17,700. The
number of the children of Japheth, the men of war and the
armour-bearers, as Pinḥas their prince had numbered them was 142,000,
besides women and children. (4) Nimrod the chief numbered the children
of Ham under his sway, and found them to be 12,600; the children of
Misraim under him were, 24,900; the children of Phut, 27,700; of Canaan,
32,900; of Sheba, 4,300 (?); of Ḥavilah, 24,300; of Sabta, 25,300; of
Ra‘amah, 30,600; of Sabtecha, 46,400. And the number of the children of
Ham, according to the numbering of Nimrod the prince, was 492,000
valiant men who went out to war, besides the women and children. <span

was 714,100. All these were numbered during the lifetime of Noah, and
Noah lived after the flood 350 years. And all the days of Noah were 950
years, and he died.
