### THE CHRONICLES OF MOSES.

XLIII\. (1) In the 130th year after the Israelites had gone down to
Egypt, Pharaoh dreamt a dream. While he was sitting on the throne of his
kingdom he lifted up his eyes, and beheld an old man standing before
him. In his hand he held a pair of scales as used by merchants. The old
man then took the scales and, holding them up before Pharaoh, he laid
hold of all the elders of Egypt and its princes, together with all its
great men, and, having bound them together, placed them in one pan of
the scales. After that he took a milch goat, and, placing it in the
other pan, it outweighed all the others. Pharaoh then awoke, and it was
a dream.

\(2\) Rising early next morning, he called all his servants, and told
them the dream. They were sorely frightened by it, and one of the king's
eunuchs said, 'This is nothing else than the foreboding of a great evil
about to fall upon Egypt.' On hearing this the king said to the eunuch,
'What will it be?' And the eunuch replied, 'A child will be born in
Israel, who will destroy all the land of Egypt.

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> If it is pleasing
to the king, let the royal command go forth in all the land of Egypt
that every male born among the Hebrews should be slain, so that this
evil be averted from the land of Egypt.

\(3\) The king did so, and accordingly sent for the Hebrew midwives, one
of whom was named Shifrah, and another Puah, and said to them, 'When the
Hebrew women give birth, and ye see upon the stools that it is a son, ye
slay it; but if a daughter, then let it live.' But the midwives feared
God, and did not act according to the king's word, but let the males
live. The king, therefore, summoned the midwives, and said to them, 'Why
have ye done this thing, and kept the males alive?' And the midwives
answered Pharaoh, saying, 'The Hebrew women are not like the Egyptian
women, for they are like the free animals of the field which do not
require midwives; before the midwives come to them the children are
born.'

\(4\) When Pharaoh saw that he could not do anything with them, he
commanded all his people, saying, 'Every male that is born ye shall cast
into the river; but all the females ye shall keep alive.' When the
Israelites heard this command of Pharaoh to cast their males into the
river, some of the people separated from their wives, while others
remained with them. It came to pass, about the time of childbirth, that
the women went out into the field, and the Lord, who swore to their
ancestors that He would multiply them, sent them an angel, one of his
ministers, who was appointed over childbirth, to wash it, and rub it
with salt; and the angel bound it in swaddling clothes, and placed in
the child's hand two smooth stones, from the one of which it sucked
milk, and from the other honey. God also caused its hair to grow down to
its knees, so as to be well covered by it; and the angel rocked it
caressingly.

\(5\) And when God had compassion upon them and sought to increase them
upon the face of the whole land, He commanded the earth to swallow the
children up, and protect them until they grew up, after which time it
should open its mouth and let them go forth so that they should

sprout as the grass of the field, and as the young trees of the forest.
Then they would return to their families, and to the house of their
fathers, where they would remain. (6) Accordingly, it happened that
after the earth had swallowed up, through the mercy of God, the males
born of the house of Jacob, that the Egyptians went out into the field
to plough with teams of oxen and with the ploughshare. They worked
(ploughed) upon them as the spoiler in time of the harvest. But although
they ploughed never so hard they were unable to injure them, and thus
they increased abundantly.

\[<span class="smallcaps">Another Version</span>.—It came to pass at the
time of birth that they left their children in the field, and the Lord,
who swore to their ancestors that He would cause them to inherit the
land, tamed for them the beasts of the field, and sustained and reared
them, as it is said, 'And the beasts of the field were at peace with
thee.' When the Egyptians saw that they (the Israelites) left their sons
in the field, and that the wild beasts helped them, and led them in the
forests until they had grown to manhood, they said, 'These have surely
reared them in the caverns and vaults of the earth,' and each of them
brought their ploughshare and their plough, and ploughed above them,
etc.\]
