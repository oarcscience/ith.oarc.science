# CHRONICLES OF JERAHMEEL.

### COMPILER'S PREFACE.

<span class="smallcaps">Behold</span> I have sworn not to lend anybody
this book to take away, with the exception of three, whom I shall
mention by name, but whoever desires to read it at my house is at
liberty to do so.

Behold I am the youngest of all my family. I, Elazar, son of R. Asher,
the Levite, have set my mind upon writing from precious and valuable
secular books, for my spirit bore me aloft and filled me with enthusiasm
in the days of my youth, when I was easygoing and keen-witted. For I saw
many books scattered and dispersed here and there. I then resolved to
collect them, and unite them in one book. I then made a collection of
the words of the wise and their aphorisms, and wrote them down in a book
for the use of those who love parable and history, and for wise men
generally who are not otherwise occupied, in order that they may reflect
upon these things, so that they may see, understand, and know the truth
concerning a few of the events which have taken place under the sun, and
of a few of the troubles and afflictions which our ancestors endured in
their exile, and what vicissitudes they underwent when the tempest swept
over them, so that they may not be forgotten by their seed. Therefore I
called this book the 'Book of Chronicles,' wherein may be recorded

<span id="page_2">p. 2</span>

many varied events. For I have collected in this book records of all
events and incidents which have happened from the creation of the world
until the present day as it is written in this book, and as I found, so
I copied, and I have deftly woven the materials to form one book.

Nor did I write them to make myself a great name, but to the glory of my
Creator, who truly knows, and so that this book should be a memorial for
future generations; and whoever chooses to add to this book may add, and
may blessing fall upon him. Behold I hope that God may make my son
worthy of inheriting this Book of Chronicles, which I have collected
from many books. I wrote it, and laid aside many affairs for its sake,
so. as to be able to complete it. The bulk of it I wrote in the autumn
and winter, for I only had leisure at that time. 'In the day the drought
consumed me, and the cold at night, and drove my sleep from my eyes.'
And many events have happened, and what I was not able to do in the
daytime, I did at night, for I neither rested nor reposed until I had
completed its composition. For I gave a long time to it, and I was
constantly occupied upon its composition, and I was continually busy
with it, and I worked and laboured vigorously until I had selected each
subject and placed it in its proper position, like a pearl in its
setting and like a hook in its eye, and had I done it for payment no sum
would have satisfied me, for I dwelt upon it days and years until I had
completed its composition, for I had not always the books to copy it
from, nor had I often the leisure, whilst occasionally I was not in the
humour, on account of many misfortunes which befell me in my captivity.
Therefore I conjure and command my son—since I bequeath him this Book of
Chronicles—that I hand it to him on his undertaking to fulfil the solemn
conditions which I impose upon him, a father to his son. He may not sell
it, nor may he give it away nor pledge it, neither he nor his posterity,
neither may he exchange it nor substitute anything else for it. For what
will a small amount of money avail him, since he could not succeed in
purchasing its

<span id="page_3">p. 3</span>

equal or its like in the whole world, either for a large or small sum of
money? For I have searched in many places before I composed it; for this
reason rather let a man pledge or sell the cloak from his back before he
disposes of this. For I know that nobody can obtain half its worth or
value, for no scribe could be found to write it for less than six small
pieces of gold, to say nothing of the parchment. And who sells it will
soon squander the money on frivolity; then he will immediately repent
his transaction, but in vain. Moreover, I can assure him that he will
never obtain its like, inasmuch as I know full well that no man would
compose another such work, on account of the magnitude of the task;
further, I know that nobody is broad-minded enough to resolve to compose
and publish such a book as this, for it appears at first sight a
collection of tales. Nevertheless, if he wishes to dispose of it to one
of his sons or to one of his brothers, he may do so, but the one who
acquires it may not override my conditions, but must observe everything
as set down here. And he may only bequeath this book to one of his sons,
or, failing male issue, he should bequeath it to one of his brothers,
but not to one of his daughters, who have no portion or inheritance in
it, that this book may not pass from one tribe to another. And do not,
my sons, resolve to divide the work into two or three portions, so that
each one of you may have a share in it, but let the one who inherits it
receive it in one volume. May the one who ignores my writing,
transgresses my command, or does not fulfil my words, be cursed; but
blessed be my descendants, and may they be established if they fulfil my
wishes. Neither scoff at me when you notice in what detail I have
communicated my wishes concerning this book to my sons, for do ye not
know that whatever man completes by the labour and toil of his hands he
values highly? And I knew that unless I did it myself, unassisted, I
should never have completed it. For who can depend upon scribes in the
case of a book of this kind? Besides, even if I had the will, could I
order scribes to be present just as books came to my hand; and where
could I

<span id="page_4">p. 4</span>

get the books from? Therefore I said, 'If I do not do it for myself,
who, then, will do it for me?' And God enlightened me, and I girded my
loins like a mighty man, and composed this Book of Chronicles. May God
remember it for me for good!
