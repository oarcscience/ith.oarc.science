XCII\. (1) When Apolonius, the captain of the Macedonian host, heard
these things, he said, 'Who is it that dared to rebel against our lord
the king?' And he gathered unto him a large and strong multitude of
Macedonian warriors, and marched forwards to fight against Israel. Judah
went out to meet him, and a very fierce battle ensued between the
Macedonians and the assembly of the Ḥassidim. During the battle Judah
saw Apolonius standing in the midst of the Macedonian company, and ran
towards him in the fury of his anger into the valley, and, smiting right
and left and in front of him, he cut down the mighty men of Greece just
as the reaper cuts down the sheaves and the corn of his harvest. Then,
approaching Apolonius, he smote him with the edge of the sword and
felled him to the ground. Then, putting the Greeks and Macedonians to
flight, they fled in haste, and Judah and the assembly of the Ḥassidim
pursued them and smote them with a very great slaughter, and, having
taken their spoil, Judah seized Apolonius's sword and fought with it all
his life. (2) When Seron (\#\#\#), the captain of the host of Syria,
heard this he said, 'I will go and fight against Judah, and thus make a
name for myself.' Then, summoning all his people, he went to Beth-Ḥoron.
Judah, becoming aware of this, said to his men, "There is no time for
delay; let us go out to them, although our brethren the Ḥassidim have
gone away from us; for if we wait until they return, our enemies will
say we are afraid of them.' Therefore Judah marched all

the night long; at daybreak, when the people suddenly beheld in the
distance a strong and mighty army, they said to Judah, 'How can we who
are so few go to war against this great multitude?' But Judah replied,
'Cry unto heaven, and ye shall be saved, for the battle is in the hands
of the Lord to deliver the many into the hands of the few; it is in His
power to save either with a multitude or with a few.' (3) Judah then
went sideways near the enemy's camp, and suddenly leaping upon them, he
struck terror into them, and thereby Seron with all his men were put in
confusion. Judah pursued him, and, overtaking him, smote him. On that
day as many as 800 corpses of the Syrians were found piled up in heaps
on the field. Those that remained fled into the land of the Philistines,
and the fear of Judah fell upon all the nations.

\(4\) Now, as soon as Antiochus heard these things, he was very much
vexed, and gathering together all his people and all the nations under
his rule, mustered a strong and mighty army, and divided it into two
portions. With one half he went to (Persia), for the Persians had
revolted from the Macedonian rule when they saw that the people of Judah
had rebelled. The other half he handed over to Lysias (\#\#\#), of his
own kin, and of royal Macedonian descent, saying to him, 'Thou knowest
all that Judah, the son of Mattathiah, has done to my two chiefs,
Apolonius and Seron, and to all their host. Therefore, go now and smite
all the inhabitants of Judah, and my son Eopator (\#\#\#) will go with
thee. I myself will go to Persia and uproot the nation that rebelled
against me.'

\(5\) Accordingly, Antiochus the king went to Persia, and left Lysias in
command to wage war against Judah and look after his son. Lysias chose
for himself Tolmios (\#\#\#), who is Ptolemy, Nicanor, and Gorgias, men
of valour, sending with them 40,000 young warriors on foot and 7,000
horsemen, and the entire armies of both Syria and Philistia joined them
in marching against Judah to destroy it. When Judah and all the elders
of Israel heard this they proclaimed a fast, and clothed themselves in
sackcloth, and

<span id="page_273">p. 273</span>

placing dust upon their heads, cried unto the Lord. (6) After the fast
Judah numbered his people, and appointed over them captains of
thousands, captains of hundreds, captains of fifties, and captains of
tens. Then marching into the field, he issued an order in the camp,
saying, 'Whoever has planted a vineyard or built a house, and whoever is
betrothed or faint-hearted, let him return home;' and many of them
returned. There thus remained 7,000 valiant men, chosen warriors, of
whom one would not have run away before a hundred enemies.

\(7\) Judah then marched on to meet Nicanor, who had brought many
merchants with him, for he intended to sell to them the young men and
the young women whom he would capture and carry into captivity from
Judah. He went into the valley to meet Judah. Judah, coming out of the
assembly of the Ḥassidim who were with him, called upon the Lord,
saying, 'O exalted God, who hast ruled from the creation until this
time, who causeth battles to cease, and in whose hands is power and
might to exalt or to humble, subdue and humble this nation before the
lowly of Thy people, for Thou wilt subdue nations under us and peoples
under our feet.' After his prayer, the priests blew their holy trumpets,
and all the people raised a shout. Then did Judah leap into battle, and
smote the camp of Nicanor with heavy slaughter, so that they fled before
him. Pursuing them with his army, he continued to slay them in their
flight. The number of the slain was 9,000. They then returned and took
their spoil, and the gold which the merchants had brought with them to
purchase the Israelitish youths. This they distributed among the poor,
and then rested in that place, for the battle was fought on the sixth
day.
