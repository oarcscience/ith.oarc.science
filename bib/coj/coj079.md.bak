LXXV\. (1) And the first answered and said, 'O my lord the king, princes
and mighty men, do ye not know the power of the king and the strength of
his dominion over all the earth, over the sea, the isles, and over all
languages? to slay or to keep alive? If he commands an army to march
forth, they march forth armed; they turn not their heads, though they
may stand face to face with death. If he command them to overthrow
cities, they overthrow them; if to hew down mountains, or to pull down
walls, they obey. If he command them to plough for him, they plough;
they sow and reap his produce, for they fear the wrath of the king, who
is mighty and lord over all, and no one dares frustrate his word;
therefore believe ye my words that there is no one on earth so powerful
as a king.' All the bystanders were astonished at his speech.

\(2\) The second now replied, saying, 'Though ye know the power of a
king and the strength of his might, for he has dominion and rules over
the land; yet wine is stronger than a king. It is true he has great
power, but as soon as he drinks freely of wine, it overpowers him and
inclines his heart to other things, he sings, plays and dances, for his
heart is turned by the wine, so that he repulses his kin, approaches
strangers, slays his friends, and confers honour upon strangers, and
respects neither his father nor mother. (3) Do ye not know that such is
the power of wine, when a man is drunk he cannot learn, but is rather
prone to singing; he whispers to his neighbour and reveals secrets, and
hidden things drop out of his mouth. Men full of sorrow the wine makes
glad,

<span id="page_227">p. 227</span>

and even if mourners and those whose hearts are grieved drink thereof,
they rejoice and are merry. The drunken one draws his sword against his
neighbour, and he gets fierce, and bashful men it makes bold. But when
the wine has disappeared from them, they have forgotten all, and say,
"We have not done this thing." Is thus wine not stronger than a king, as
it rules over him; it makes man walk crookedly, he cannot see straight,
and he continues babbling things which he has not learned. Do ye not
think that wine is therefore more powerful than a king, for such it
does?' Thereat the men were greatly surprised.

\(4\) After that the king summoned Zerubbabel, and said, 'Tell me, I
pray thee, thy riddle and its interpretation, as thy friends have done.'
And he answered and said, 'Give ear and hearken unto me, O king and
princes, governors and rulers, and all ye who stand here. Indeed, the
king is stronger and greater than all; it is true that wine weakens the
king through its strength. as my friends have said. Thus the power of
both the king and wine cannot be denied; but woman is yet more powerful
than either king or wine or any other strong drink. For why should she
not be more powerful than the king? Did she not give birth to him,
suckle him, sustain him, rear him, clothe him, wash him, and sometimes
chastise him? Did she not rule over him as a mother does the child of
her womb? When she was angry with him, did he not fear her rebuke? Did
she not sometimes beat him and at other times censure him? If she lifted
the rod to him, did he not run away from her in fear of her? Moreover,
when he grows up to be a young man, he cannot forget his instructress,
nor will rebel against her call. He always respects her as a son honours
her who conceived him.

\(5\) 'Then looking about him, he beholds a woman fair to look upon, and
desires her beauty to sport with. His heart inclines towards her, and he
will not change his love for her for all the riches. It is then that he
leaves his father and mother, forsaking them for her love and her
beauty, and many are they that have been led astray

<span id="page_228">p. 228</span>

through the love of woman; many are they that have acted foolishly, and
become mad for her sake; and many that have met their death for the sake
of woman, and have fallen for her pride down into hell. Wise men also
have been caught in her net, and much hatred has the frivolous one
caused among brothers. Do ye not know and understand that if a man sees
a comely woman, and he carries in his hands goodly things, will not his
eyes gaze upon her, for his heart inclines towards her? If she answers
him when he speaks to her on account of her beauty, will he not leave
everything that he keeps in his hands to speak to her? for his heart is
drawn near to her.

\(6\) 'Who is there that will not believe this, and confess the truth of
this power of woman? Tell me, for whom do ye steal, for whom do ye rob,
and for whom do ye gird yourselves—is it not for woman? Is it not for
her that ye buy all the precious ornaments? is not the myrrh and the
aloe for her? are not all the spices, perfumed oils, and frankincense
for her? If a man break into a house, if he keeps the high roads, goes
on the sea, on dry land, on the mountains; if he fight, commit murder,
rob, plunder, and shed blood, to whom will he bring his spoil, if not to
woman? Have I not seen the concubine of the King Apumaṣia (\#\#\#), the
daughter of Abyaush (\#\#\#) of Makeden, take the crown of honour from
off the king's head and place it on her own head, while he was seated on
the throne beside her, and the king was pleased with her? But when she
became angry, did not the king then hasten to appease her, and to
reconcile her, and remove her anger?

\(7\) 'Who, then, is there that will not believe that woman's power is
stronger than everything? She subdued Samson, enticed David, and
inclined the heart of Solomon towards her. Many are her captives, and
innumerable are those that are slain through her, and their number
increases. And even if there be one man who rules the whole world, and
before whose wrath all people tremble and shake, since he would be
supreme, and although man is appointed

<span id="page_229">p. 229</span>

to be the prince, ruler, and king over her, and to her is given the
desire of him, yet not even he would be able to conquer her and to rule
over her. Even Adam, the father of all mankind, was induced by his wife
to transgress the word of God, by which she destined him and his
offspring to death. Also, in the days of Noah, the heavenly angels were
led astray and took to them women. Who does not believe that this is
known from the very beginning of the world, and will last to the end
unaltered? This is the truth that I utter.

\(8\) 'Now, finally, let it be known to the king and to all my hearers
that all is vanity here—the king who rules the earth, the wine that
rules the king, and woman with her iniquity, who rules the three; but
truth reigns supreme in heaven and on earth; in the seas and in the
depths truth prevails before God and man; for where truth dwells there
wickedness cannot abide, for the heavens and the earth are founded upon
truth, and the Lord our God is true for ever.'

\(9\) After this all the people assembled there before the king
exclaimed, 'It is true.' Then said the king to Zerubbabel, 'Come near to
me.' When he approached, the king kissed him and embraced him in the
presence of all the people, and said, 'Blessed be the Lord God of
Zerubbabel, who hath given him the spirit of truth, for there is nothing
like God's truth; everything else is vanity.' And the princes also
exclaimed, 'Indeed, truth is greater than all things; nor can one stand
up against it since it dwells in the heaven and in the earth, and upon
it is everything based. True is the God of Zerubbabel, who hath given
him the spirit of truth to praise and to glorify truth before God and
man.'
