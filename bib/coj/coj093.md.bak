LXXXIX\. (1) Seven brothers with their mother were then seized and sent
to the king, for the king had not yet departed from Jerusalem, and
because the swine's flesh was abhorred by the Jews and stank and was
despised by them, therefore the cruelties against them were increased,
and he tore their flesh as that of an ox.

\(2\) When the first son was brought before the king, he said, 'Why
waste words to teach us, for we have already been taught by our
forefathers? We are prepared to suffer death for the Lord and His law.'
The king was furious at this, and, ordering a pan of brass to be
brought, placed it on the fire. Then, ordering his tongue to be cut out,
his hands and legs and the skin of his head to be cut off, he placed
them all in the frying-pan in the sight of his brothers; the rest of his
body they cast in a large brass pot placed upon the hot coals. When he
was near death the king commanded the fire to be removed from under the
pot so that he should not die too quickly, so as to terrify his brothers
and his mother. But they, on the contrary, encouraged each other and
fortified each other when they saw that their brother gave up his life
for the Lord and His Torah, and said to each other, 'See what Moses, the
servant of the Lord, said in his song, "He shall be comforted in His
servants." Even now the Lord is comforted in us for all the evil which
He has purposed to do to His people, and He will have compassion upon
them.'

\(3\) As soon as the first died, the second brother was brought. They
said to him, 'Listen to the command of the king. Why die in great
torture as thy brother?' And he replied, 'Make haste with the sword and
with the fire, and do not do one whit less to me than ye did to my
brother, for I do not fall short of my brother in piety and the fear of
God.' Every limb was then commanded to be cut off and placed in the
frying-pan on the fire. He then said, 'Hear me, thou cruel king: art
thou able to bind up these our souls which thou robbest us of? Behold,
they shall walk to God, who has given them to us—to the light that is
with the Lord. We shall yet live a life that has no limit or end when He
awakeneth the dead of His people and the slain of His servants.'

\(4\) Thus died the second brother. When the third was brought, he
looked at the king, and, stretching out his right hand towards the king,
said, 'What business of thine is it to destroy us, O thou enemy and foe?
All this comes from Heaven, and we receive it with love, but thy
tortures are despicable in our eyes, as nothing before us, since we
expect honour and favour from Heaven. He will grant us the reward of our
actions.' The king and all his princes were astonished at the bravery of
the youth.

\(5\) After his death the fourth brother was brought. 'What,' said he,
'have I to do with thee, O thou wicked man? We die for the Lord, and He
will again bring us back to life, but thou shalt never rise again.'

\(6\) When the fifth was brought, he said, 'Do not imagine that God has
forsaken us, for on account of His great love has He brought us to this
honour. Thou reviler and blasphemer, the Lord hates thee and stirs thee
up to do unto us whatever thou wilt, but a great vengeance will be taken
upon thee and thy seed, and His anger will be kindled against thee and
all thy household.'

\(7\) After his death the sixth brother was brought before the king, and
he said, 'We know our wickedness, for we have sinned against the Lord,
and now our souls are given over to death as an atonement for our
people; but now because

<span id="page_265">p. 265</span>

thy heart prompts thee to do this thing to the servants of our God and
to fight against God; behold, He shall fight against thee and uproot
thee from the face of the earth.'

\(8\) The seventh and last brother was but a young lad, yet the mother,
who had seen her seven sons slain on one day, neither feared nor
trembled, but, standing upright by the corpses of her sons, she lifted
up her voice and cried, saying, 'O my son! O my son! I do not know how
you were formed in my womb, nor did I give you the breath and soul which
you had, nor bring you out of my womb, nor raise you, nor make you grow,
or your flesh which is now offered as a sacrifice; God formed it. He
wove the sinews and covered it with skin, and caused hair to grow upon
it. He then breathed in your nostrils the breath of life. And since you
give up all this for His sake, He will restore them to you, and will
renew your body. He will give you the reward of your actions, and happy
are ye, my sons, for all this.'

\(9\) At this the king was very much taken aback, in that the woman had
subdued him. 'Bring me the seventh one,' said he, 'and perhaps, as he is
but a young lad, I may be able to entice him with soft words to do our
will, but do not let this woman boast of me, saying, 'I have conquered
King Antiochus in exhorting my sons to die for our God.'

\(10\) According to the king's command, the seventh lad was brought, and
the king implored him, and took an oath to enrich him with silver and
gold, with cattle and many servants, to make him viceregent, and to let
him rule over the whole kingdom. But when the lad despised the words of
the king, the king summoned the mother to him, and said, 'O good woman,
have pity upon this child, and be merciful to the fruit of thy womb;
induce him to perform my will and to escape.' And the woman answered,
'Give him to me, and I shall entice him with kind words.' This being
done, she led him aside, and having kissed him, and rejoiced at the
king's shame and confusion, said, 'O my son, thou whom I carried in my
womb for nine months,

<span id="page_266">p. 266</span>

and whom I suckled for three years, after which I sustained thee with
food until this very day, give up all this proffered honour, and fear
the God of whom I taught thee. (11) Now, O my son, look toward the
heaven, and behold the land, the sea, the waters, and the fire, which by
the word of the Lord were created. But man is merely flesh and blood and
as nothing before Him. Do not fear this cruel man, but give up thy life
for the sake of the Lord. Go the same way as thy brothers. Would that I
could now see where thy brothers are, and the greatness of their glory
before the Lord. My son, cleave to thy brothers, and thy lot shall be
cast in their glory. I shall go there with you, and rejoice with you as
on the days of your marriage. I shall be with you in your
righteousness.'

\(12\) While she was yet speaking the lad answered, and said, 'Why do
you delay me, and will not leave me to go and join my holy brothers? I
will not listen to the king, but to the law of our God, which He has
given through the hand of Moses to the people of Israel, which this
cruel enemy of God has put to shame and reviled. Woe unto thee, woe unto
thee! Whither wilt thou go? whither wilt thou flee? whither wilt thou
run? and where wilt thou hide thyself from our God, O enemy, foe, and
wicked man, for He still keeps us alive, and has glorified and exalted
us over all nations? But thou who art insolent enough to stretch forth
thy hand against His servants, it were better thou hadst not been born.
Thou wicked fool Antiochus, who wast begotten of tainted folly, hast
committed evil against thyself, but Thou hast done good unto us, and if
we endure and bear these tortures in this world, we shall be taken to
the life and light of the world where there is no darkness, but eternal
life without death. (13) But thou wilt be the abomination of all
creatures, and wilt be abhorred of our God when He takes vengeance upon
thee. Thou shalt die an unnatural death, plagued with dreadful plagues.
Thou shalt descend to the bottom of hell. Thou shalt be drawn into
darkness, where there is no life or light, but darkness and shades;
where there

<span id="page_267">p. 267</span>

is no repose or; rest, but trouble, sorrow, brimstone, and fire. This
will be thy portion of the Lord and thy lot from our God, O man of blood
and wicked man. But God will have mercy upon His people. Until now His
wrath has rested upon us, but He will henceforth be angry no longer with
His people, but will repent of what He has done to us at the beginning,
although He did so in truth and in righteousness, for we acted wickedly.
He will return and have mercy upon us, and will grant us eternal life.'
King Antiochus now became exceedingly angry because he would not perform
his will, and therefore increased the tortures, and acted much more
cruelly to him than he had done to the others. Thus died the seventh.

\(14\) The mother then stood by the corpses of her sons, and, spreading
out her hands, she said, 'O exalted and awe-inspiring God, O God of the
universe, now will I come; now will I die with my sons in the place
which Thou hast prepared for them.' While she was yet speaking she
finished her days upon earth, falling upon the dead bodies of her sons,
her spirit went forth, and she died with them.
