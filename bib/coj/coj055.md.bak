LI\. (1) Now, what was the special merit of Moses, that God Himself
should attend on his burial? It was for the following reason. When he
went down to Egypt and the time for the redemption of Israel had
arrived, all the Israelites busied themselves with the silver and gold,
while Moses, for three days and three nights, wearied himself by walking
round the city silently searching for Joseph's coffin, since they could
not depart from Egypt without Joseph, for he had made them promise him
before his death and swear that they would do it, as it is said, 'And
Joseph made the children of Israel swear.'

\(2\) When Moses was already exceedingly tired, a woman, Seraḥ, the
daughter of Asher, met him, and, seeing him very faint and weary, she
said to him, 'My lord Moses, why art thou faint?' 'Because,' said he, 'I
have been wandering round the city for three days and three nights in
search of Joseph's coffin, but have not yet been able to find it.' 'Come
with me, and I will show thee where it is.' Leading him to a brook in
that place, she then related to him that the magicians and wizards of
Pharaoh had made a coffin of lead for Joseph, weighing 500 talents, and
cast it into the brook. They thus spoke to Pharaoh, 'If it please the
king, this nation will now not be able to go forth from this place as it
cannot discover Joseph's coffin.'

\(3\) Standing by the edge of the brook, Moses exclaimed, 'Joseph,
Joseph, thou knowest how thou didst cause Israel to swear, saying, "The
Lord will surely visit you," Now bestow glory upon the God of Israel,
and do not prevent their redemption. Beseech, I pray thee, thy Creator
that thou mayest rise from these depths.' Immediately after this the
coffin ascended from the depths, preceded by a bubbling of the waters,
floating as lightly as a reed. Lifting it upon his shoulders, he carried
it along, followed by all the Israelites. They carried the silver and
the gold which they took from Egypt, whilst Moses carried the coffin.
Then said the Lord to Moses, 'Thou sayest that thou hast in this done a
small thing; by thy life, the

<span id="page_142">p. 142</span>

mercy which thou hast shown is great, since thou didst not think of the
silver and the gold. I shall, therefore, show thee the same mercy when
thou departest this life. I shall with My glory bestow kindness on
thee.'

\(4\) Thus, when the time had arrived for Moses to quit this world, and
God said to him, 'Behold, the time approaches for thee to die,' he
exclaimed, 'O Lord of the universe, after having received the law, and
having suffered such weariness, dost Thou tell me, "The day of thy death
draws near "? I shall not die, but will live.' Thou canst not, for this
is the way of man.' 'Lord of the universe,' entreated Moses, 'I beseech
thee before my death to allow me to enter and search all the gates of
the heavens and the depths of the earth, that they may see there is none
besides Thee, as it is said, "And thou shalt know this day, and lay it
up in thy,heart that the Lord is God and no one else."' God said, 'Thou
hast written of Me: "and no one else." I say of thee there has not yet
arisen in Israel any one like Moses, who knew the Lord face to face.'
What is the meaning of the words, 'Behold, thy day draws near to its end
'? R. Simon said, The very day appeared before God, and said, "Lord of
the universe, I shall not move nor end, so that Moses may continue to
live."'

\(5\) The sages asked, 'What did Moses do as soon as he knew the day on
which he was to die? R. Janai said, that on that day he wrote thirteen
scrolls, twelve for the tribes, and one he placed in the Ark. In the
event of their seeking to falsify a word, they might refer to the one in
the Ark. Then said Moses, 'While I have been occupying myself with the
Torah which is living, the day has set and the decree is thus annulled.'
God then forthwith made a sign to the heavens, and the day remained at a
standstill, saying, 'I will not set, so that Moses shall live.'
Therefore Job uttered, 'Did not I weep for him that was in trouble
(whose day was fixed), that is, the day was hardened (fixed) for him?'
What is the meaning of the words, 'Behold, thy day draws near '? Just as
One man

says to his neighbour, 'Behold, someone has sued thee before the King.'

\(6\) He called Joshua, and addressed God thus, 'Lord of the universe,
let Joshua, my servant, be the ruler, and I shall live.' God replied,
'Serve thou him as he did serve thee.' Moses then rose up and hastened
to the house of Joshua, who was greatly afraid, and said, 'Moses, my
teacher, has come to me.' When he went out Moses walked on Joshua's left
side. When they entered the tent of the congregation, the pillar of
cloud descended and separated them; as soon as it departed Moses went up
to Joshua, and asked, 'What did the Word say to thee?' And Joshua
replied, 'When the Word was revealed to thee, I knew what was said to
thee.' Moses then wept, saying, Better one hundred deaths, than one
jealousy.' Solomon explains it thus, that love was as strong as death,
and jealousy as Sheol, *i.e.*, the love which Moses bare Joshua, and the
jealousy which he showed towards him. When Moses was about to die, God
tried to appease him, saying, 'By thy life, as thou hast guarded My
children in this world, so will I in the future world make thee the
leader of My children,' as it is said, 'And He will remember the days of
old.'

\(7\) This is the blessing with which Moses blessed the children of
Israel before his death. What is the meaning of the expression, 'Before
his death '? The sages say that Moses took hold of the angel of death,
and compelled him to go before him while he blessed each one of the
twelve tribes. R. Meir says that the angel of death approached Moses,
and said to him, 'The Lord has sent me to thee, because thou must depart
on this day.' Moses said, 'I seek to praise God, as it is said, "I shall
not die, but live to tell of the works of God."' 'But why,' said the
angel, 'art thou so boastful? for there are others who praise Him; the
heavens and the earth glorify Him every hour, as it is said, "The
heavens declare the glory of God." But I will silence them,' continued
Moses, 'as it is said, "Listen, O heavens, while I speak."' For the
second time the angel

<span id="page_144">p. 144</span>

of death approached him, but as soon as Moses uttered the 'Shem
Hammeforash' (Ineffable Name), he fled, as it is said, 'When I call upon
the name of the Lord, bring ye greatness to our God.' When the angel of
death approached him the third time, Moses said, 'It is now necessary
for me to justify the Divine judgment upon me,' for it is said, The
Rock, whose work is perfect.'

\(8\) R. Isaac said that the soul of Moses refused to depart from him,
so that Moses communed with it, saying, 'Dost thou aver that the angel
of death tried to overcome thee?' 'God will not do this,' it replied,
'for "thou hast delivered my soul from death."' 'Has he caused thee to
see them crying, and made thee weep with them?' 'No, for "(thou hast
delivered) my eye from tears."' 'But did he try to make me fall among
them (the people)?' '"Thou hast prevented my foot,"' said it, '"from
slipping."' 'And where wilt thou in the future walk?' The soul replied,
'I shall walk before the Lord in the lands of the living.' As soon as
Moses heard this, he exclaimed, 'Return, O my soul, to thy rest.' R.
Abin said that as soon as they departed the mortals glorified God,
saying, 'Moses has commanded us a law, an everlasting inheritance to the
congregation of Jacob.'
