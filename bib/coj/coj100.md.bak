*Chronicles of Jerahmeel*, by M. Gaster \[1899\], at Intangible Textual
Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

XCVI\. (1) In those days the Lord began to render the fourth kingdom
more powerful than the third, that is the kingdom of Rome, which was
stirred up against the kingdom of Greece. The name of the Roman was
exalted over all the empires of the world. That was the fourth animal
which Daniel, that greatly-beloved man, saw in a vision. Just as that
animal devoured, crushed and trampled upon everything, so did this
nation of Romans devour and crush all the other nations. It was they who
fought with Antiochus, King of Greece, his 120 elephants and a strong
and powerful army of infantry and cavalry, whom they conquered in the
battle, and compelled to pay the Romans tribute.

\(2\) They also humbled the pride of Annibal, King of Africa, who
reigned over the city whose name was Carthagene. Annibal entered the
field with an army as mighty and as numerous as the sand upon the
seashore. With him were all the armies of Ethiopia, Phut and Lud, and
other mighty nations. Having crossed the narrow sea between Africa and
Sefarad, he humbled the pride of the nation of the Goths (\#\#\#).
Journeying thence, he arrived in the land of Germania by the sea
Oceanus. Thence he came to Italy and engaged in battle with the Romans,
who went out to meet him. It was a long and fierce contest, in which the
Romans were utterly routed.

\(3\) The Romans, however, continued to fight, and in ten years no less
than eighteen battles were fought with Annibal, but they could make no
stand before him. At length, they again mustered all their warriors, at
the head

of whom were two valiant men, Æmilius and Varros. Having arranged their
men in line of battle by the river Eopiros (\#\#\#), the battle was
fought at Canusi (\#\#\#), a large city. Here a fierce and desperate
battle was fought, in which 90,000 Romans met their death. (4) Among
them was Æmilius, one of the Roman commanders. Varros (\#\#\#), however,
managed to escape to Venosia (\#\#\#), a city situated between the
mountains and the plain. Of Annibal's men, 40,000 were killed in that
battle. Having pursued the Romans up to the gates of the city, he
besieged the city for eight days, and building turrets in front of the
city, fought against it.

\(5\) Then the Roman counsellors said to each other, 'Let us open the
gate and come and make a covenant with Annibal, that we may live and not
be put to death.' This they determined to do, when a young man, whose
name was Scipios (\#\#\#), arose, and said to the 320 counsellors of the
city, 'Far be it from us to subject ourselves to Annibal.' 'But what can
we do,' answered they, 'since we have not been able to make a stand
before Annibal for the last eighteen years?' 'Then,' said Scipio, 'come,
let us take counsel. Give me about five legions of men, and I will go to
the land of Africa and attack and destroy his land. As soon as Annibal
hears this, he will hasten away from Rome to deliver his own land from
my hands, and thus will ye obtain rest.'

\(6\) Having consented to his proposal, he took with him 30,000 Romans,
and marching to Africa, the country of Annibal, he engaged in battle, in
which Astrubal, Annibal's brother, was slain. Scipio cut off his head
and brought it to Rome, and, mounting the wall, he cried out to Annibal,
'Why art thou so eager for our land, and dost not go to deliver thy own
land from my hands, which I am destroying?' He then sent Annibal his
brother's head. When he recognised it he braced himself up, and
hardening his heart, swore not to leave the city until he had taken it,
and he besieged it for several days more.

\(7\) Scipio then returned to Africa and entirely destroyed

it. Thence he went to Carthagene and besieged it. And the men of
Carthagene sent Annibal a letter to Rome, saying, 'Why dost thou desire
a strange land, when thine own land is taken from thee? If thou wilt not
hasten here and deliver us from the hand of Scipio, we shall open the
gate and give the city of Carthagene with thy palace into his hands.'
(8) When he read this letter he wept, and immediately raised the siege,
and going to Epirus, where lay his ships, he slew there Romans without
number, men, women and children who were taken prisoners. He then went
to Africa with all his army. (9) But Scipio went out to meet him, and a
fierce war ensued between them, in which Annibal was conquered and about
50,000 of his men slain. He was likewise conquered in three pitched
battles with Scipio. After that Annibal fled to Egypt, but Scipio
followed him, and Ptolemy the king delivered him into Scipio's hands. He
was brought to Africa in great honour, and there he drank poison and
died and was buried. Scipio then captured the whole land of Africa, and
the place that abounds in gold and silver. Thus Rome was exalted above
all the other nations.
