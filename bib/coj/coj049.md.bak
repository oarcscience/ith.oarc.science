XLV\. (1) At that time a war broke out between Cush on the one side and
the people of Qedem (East) and Syria on the other; for these rebelled
against the King of Cush. Qinqanos, King of Cush, then went out to war
against the other two nations, and smote Syria and the East. He took
many captives and made them submit to Cush. (2) When Qinqanos went out
to war against Syria and the people of the East he left behind Bala‘am
the enchanter, *i.e.*, Laban the Aramean, who came from Caphtor,
together with his two sons, Janis and Jambris, to guard the city and the
poor people. But Bala‘am counselled the people to rebel against
Qinqanos, so that he should not be able to come into the city. The
people, listening to him, swore to act accordingly. Him they made king
over them, and his two sons they appointed as captains of the host of

<span id="page_114">p. 114</span>

the people. On two sides of the city they raised very high walls, while
on the third side they dug an innumerable number of pits between the
city and the river that surrounds the whole land of Cush, and from there
the people drew into them the waters of the river. On the fourth side
they collected by their wiles and witchcraft an immense number of
serpents, so that no one could approach them.

\(3\) When the king and all the captains of the army returned from the
war and saw the very high walls of the city they were greatly
astonished, and said, 'Behold, while we have been detained at war, they
have built walls to the city and strengthened themselves to prevent the
Canaanitish kings from waging war against them.' But when they came near
the city and discovered that the gates were closed, they shouted to the
keepers, 'Open the gates for us, that we may enter the city.' But they
refused to open them, just as Bala‘am the enchanter had ordered them,
and would not allow them to enter the city. They therefore drew up their
line of battle opposite the gate, and fought so that on that day there
fell 130 men of Qinqanos's army. On the second day they fought on the
side of the river. But when thirty cavalrymen tried to cross they sank
into the pits and were drowned. The king then commanded them to hew some
wood, which they were to use as rafts upon which to cross, and they did
so. When, however, they came to the walls, the rafts rolled from under
them like a mill, and on that day 200 men that had gone upon ten rafts
were sunk in the wells. On the third day they went on that side of the
city where the serpents lay, but they dared not approach. After 170 men
had been killed by these serpents they ceased fighting against Cush.
They besieged it for nine years, so that no one went out or entered the
city.

\(4\) During this siege Moses, having fled from Egypt, came to the camp
of Qinqanos, the King of Cush. He was then but eighteen years old. This
young man entered their ranks, and was much beloved by the king, the
princes, and all the army, because he was mighty and beautiful.

<span id="page_115">p. 115</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> His height was
like the cedar and his face like the rising sun, and his strength like
that of a lion. He was therefore made the king's counsellor. It came to
pass after nine years that the Cushite king was seized with an illness
by which he died, so that after seven days Qinqanos departed this life.
His servants embalmed him, and buried him opposite the gate of the city
looking towards Egypt. There they erected a beautiful building and a
very high temple, and engraved upon the stones his arms and the record
of his mighty deeds.

\(5\) When they had completed the building, they said to each other,
'What shall we now do? If we try to get into the city and fight there
will be many more of us slain than before. If we give up the siege, then
all the Syrian kings and those of the East, having heard of the death of
our king, will come upon us suddenly, and none of us will be left. Now,
let us appoint a king over us, and we shall then continue the siege
until the city falls into our hands.' They then hastily stripped
themselves of their garments, and, casting them upon the ground, they
made a large platform, upon which they placed Moses. They then blew the
trumpets, and exclaimed, 'Long live the king!' And all the princes and
all the people took the oath of obedience to him, and gave him a Cushite
wife, the widow of Qinqanos. They then crowned him King of Cush. He was
twenty-seven years old when he was made king.

\(6\) On the second day of his reign they all assembled before the king,
and said, 'If it is pleasing to the king, give us advice what to do. For
these last nine years we have not seen our wives nor our sons, but have
remained in the siege.' The king then answered the people, saying, 'Be
certain that the city will be delivered into our hands if you hearken to
my advice. Now, if we fight with them, many of us will fall as at first,
and if we determine to cross the water we shall fare similarly. Now, go
to the forest, and let each one bring a young stork, which he shall keep
until it has grown up and be taught to hunt just as the hawk.' The
people immediately hastened to the forest, and, climbing

<span id="page_116">p. 116</span>

the fir-trees, they each brought the young (of the stork) in their hands
according to the king's word.

\(7\) When the young storks had grown up, the king commanded them to
starve them for two days, and on the third day he said to them, 'Let
each man put on his armour and harness the horses and mules to the
chariots; and when each man has taken his stork in his hand, let us rise
and war against the city on the side where the serpents are lying.' This
they did. When they approached the place, the king said, 'Let each send
forth his young stork.' As soon as they did so the storks flew upon the
serpents and devoured them, thus ridding the place of them.

\(8\) When the king and the people saw that the serpents had disappeared
they raised a great shout, fought against the city, and captured it, so
that each man went to his own house, to his own wife, and to his goods.
On that day 1,100 inhabitants were killed, but of the besiegers not one.
When Bala‘am the enchanter saw that the city was taken, opening the
gate, he and his two sons fled away upon their horses to Egypt, to
Pharaoh, King of Egypt. These were the magicians and the wizards, as it
is written in the 'Sefer Hayashar' (Book of the Just = Bible), that
counselled Pharaoh to wipe out the name of Jacob from off the face of
the earth.
