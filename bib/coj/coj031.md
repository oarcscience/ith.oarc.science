and Jinôn. The children of Tisai were, Maqôl, Luon, Ṣilagtaba; the
children of Dodanim, Iteb, Bēath, and Faneg. And of these the
inhabitants of the land of Persia, Media, and those of the isles of the
sea were divided. (3) And Faneg, son of Dodanim, was the first to ride
the ships of the sea. At that time a third part of the land of Romidath
was flooded. And his sons subdued Yedid; and the sons of Magog subdued

the sons of Elishah, Ṭablo; the sons of Tarshish, Meriba; and the sons
of Kittim ...; and the sons of Dôdanim, Qaduba. Then did men begin to
till the ground, and when the land was parched, they cried to God, and
He caused a fructifying rain to descend. And it came to pass, when the
rain descended, the bow was seen in the clouds. When the inhabitants
perceived the sign of the covenant, they blessed the Lord. (4) The
children of Ham were Cush, Misraim, Put, and Canaan; and these are the
children of Cush, Sheba, Tudan, Vabni (?), Māipôn, Tinôs, Siliô, Ṭiluf,
Gilug, Lipukh. The children of Canaan were Ṣidon, Andaïm, Reṣin, Simim,

Ludim, ‘Anamim, Lehabim, Naftuḥim, Pathrosim, Kasluḥim, and Kaftorim.
These began to build the following cities: Sidon and its villages,
Risôn, Kiūza, Mazāger, Ashqalon, Debir, Qamo, Tilôn, Lakhish, Sodom,
Gomorrah, Admah, and Ṣebôim. (5) The children of Shem were Elam, Ashur,
Arpakhshad, Lud, and Aran. The sons of Ashur were Gezrôn, Ishai; and
Arpakhshad begat Shelaḥ, and Shelaḥ begat ‘Eber. Two sons were born to
Eber: the name of the one was Peleg, for in his

days the earth was divided, and the name of his brother, Yoqtan, who

Shafdifal, Shayish, Harṭman, Elifaz. These are the children of Peleg,
and these are their names. They took to them wives of the daughters of
Yoqtan, by whom were born sons and daughters, so that the whole earth
was filled with them. (6) And Re‘u took to him Malkah, the daughter of
Ruth, to wife, and begat Serug. When the days of her pregnancy were
drawing to an end, Re‘u said, 'From this one will issue a child, in the
fourth generation, whose throne will be established on high; he will be
called a perfect righteous man, the father of a multitude of nations.
His testimonies will not be forsaken, and his seed shall fill the
world.' And Re‘u begat after Serug seven sons, Abiel, Obed, Shalma,
Dedazal, Qīniza, ‘Akur, Nefesh, and five daughters, Qadima, Derifa,
Sheifa, Firiṭa, and Tehilah. (7) After Naḥor, Serug begat four sons,
Ṣillah, Diga, Sôba, and Pôra, and three daughters, Gizla, Hôglah, and
Shelifa. And after Teraḥ, Naḥor begat six sons, viz., Rekab, Deriab,
Berikhab, Shibalshaf, Nidab, and Qemuel, and eight (?) daughters,
Yiskah, Tipa, Berona, Qaniṭa. He took to wife Amtalai, the daughter of
Karnabo. (8) And Terah lived seventy years, and begat Abram, Naḥor, and
Haran, and Haran begat Loṭ. (9) Then the inhabitants of the land began
to prognosticate by the planets and to become astrologers and to
practise divination. They also passed their sons and daughters through
fire, but Serug and his sons did not walk in their ways.
