XXIV\. (1) And Cain knew Qalmana, his wife, and Enoch was born; and he
built a city and called it Enoch, after the name of his son, and he used
to entice the people, and to rob and plunder them. He built that city,
and surrounded it with a wall and dug trenches. (2) He was the first to
surround a city (with a wall), for he was afraid of his enemies. And
this city, called by the name Enoch, is the first of all cities. He was,
moreover, the counterpart of Enoch the righteous whom God took to
Himself and trained for the day which is entirely Sabbath. (3) Cain
dedicated the city to his son's name. When the city called Enoch was
finished, it was inhabited by his children, who were about double the
number of those who went forth from Egypt. Now the city became very
corrupt until the other Enoch will arise, the seventh from Adam, and
dedicate it anew with a holy dedication, together with the sons of
Lemech, who slew Cain in the seventh generation, after Cain had
confessed his sin, repented, and his punishment had been suspended until
the seventh generation. (4) And Enoch begat Irad, and Irad Mehuyael, and
Mehuyael Metushael, and Metushael Lemech, the seventh from Adam. They
were all wicked, for all the descendants of Cain were called the seed of
evil-doers, and all his descendants were swallowed up by the flood. (5)
The wicked Lemech had two wives, ‘Adah and Ṣillah, and ‘Adah bare

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Jabal; he was the
father of such as live in tents and feed the cattle. He discovered the
work appertaining to shepherds, and made tents and pens for the cattle,
one for the sheep, and another for the oxen, distinct from each other.
He also invented the locks which are made to prevent thieves entering
the house, which are like unto this, χ. And the name of his brother was
Jubal, the father of all who play on the harp and the reed-pipe. (6) At
this time the inhabitants of the earth began to commit violence, to
defile each other, and kindle the anger of the Lord. They began to sing
with the harp and the reed-pipe, and to sport with all kinds of song
corrupting the earth. This Jubal discovered the science of music, whence
arose all the tunes for the above two instruments. This art is very
great. (7) And it came to pass, when he heard of the judgments which
Adam prophesied concerning the two trials to come upon his descendants
by the flood, the dispersion and fire, he wrote down the science of
music upon two pillars, one of white marble, and the other of brick, so
that if one would melt and crumble away on account of the water, the
other would be saved. (8) And Sillah bare Tubal Cain, who forged all the
iron implements of war, and was an artificer in all kinds of ironwork.
He also discovered the art of joining lead and iron together, in order
to temper the iron and to make the blade sharper. He also invented the
pincers, the hammer, and the axe, and other instruments of iron. Tubal
was a worker in all kinds of tin and lead, iron and copper, silver and
gold. Then men began to make graven images for worship. The sister of
Tubal Cain was called Naamah. It was she who invented all kinds of
instruments used for weaving and sewing silk, wool and flax, and the
entire art of the fancy-worker and the weaver. (9) In the days of Enosh
men began to be designated by the names of princes and judges, to be
made gods, applying to them the name of the Lord. They also erected
temples for them, but in the time of Re’u they were all overthrown. (10)
It came to pass when man began to multiply upon the face of the earth,
that the

children of Elohim—that is, the seed of Seth—looked upon the daughters
of man—that is, the seed of Cain—and they took them wives of all which
they chose, and begat those giants that peopled the earth in the days of
Noah. (11) During the whole lifetime of Adam the sons of Seth had not
intermarried with the seed of Cain, but when Adam died they
intermarried. The sons of Seth dwelt in the mountains by the Garden of
Eden, while Cain dwelt in the fields of Damascus, where Abel was killed.
For seven generations the descendants of Seth kept righteous, but
thenceforward they became wicked. It was for this reason that God
repented that He had made man. (12) From the seed of Seth and Cain there
came forth the giants, who, from their haughtiness of spirit, fell and
became corrupt, and were therefore swept away by the waters of the
flood, and therefore they were called 'Nefilim' (the fallen). They
claimed the same pedigree as the descendants of Seth, and compared
themselves to princes and to men of noble descent—sons of Elohim, lords
and judges. Concerning them it is said, 'Therefore like unto man ye
shall die, and as like unto princes ye shall fall.'
