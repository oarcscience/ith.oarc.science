\[Here commences the book of Joseph ben Gorion, with the exception of
the first two pages, which contain an enumeration of the families and
ancient kings, which I have written above in its proper place in the
Book of the Generations.\]

LXVII\. (1) When God had visited upon Babylon all that He spake to His
servants Isaiah and Jeremiah, the prophets, on behalf of Jerusalem, He
raised up against them two mighty kings: Darius, King of Media, and
Cyrus, King of Persia. And Cyrus entered into close friendship with
Darius by taking his daughter to wife, so that they jointly rebelled
against Belshazzar, King of the Chaldeans. This was the commencement of
many fierce battles. At the outset the Chaldeans were victorious; but
many fell on either side, and the Chaldeans fleeing, Cyrus and Darius
pursued them until a distance of one day's journey from Babylon, and
smote them and cut them to pieces. There Cyrus and Darius encamped with
all their armies, and when the king Belshazzar saw them he sent out all
the host of his mighty men—a thousand princes and the troops that were
in the temple, a numerous and powerful band. At twilight all these
marched out of Babylon, continuing their march during the whole night.
But at the

break of morn they began to attack the camp of Darius and Cyrus, which
at the onset became bewildered, and the camp of Media fled in confusion;
but Cyrus and his men braced themselves up to fight against the
Chaldeans, and prevented them from following the Median camp. In the
night, when the battle had ceased, the slain of the Medes and Persians
were found to be very numerous.

\(2\) On that same day, as the princes of Belshazzar saw that they had
gained a victory, they came before King Belshazzar full of victory and
strength. The king made a great feast for them, and many presents of
silver and gold were given to them; and the king rejoiced with his 1,000
princes, and sat down to eat and drink with them. They prolonged the
banquet until night. Now, Belshazzar had drunk too much, and while he
was in a state of intoxication he ordered the golden vessels which had
been in the temple of our God at Jerusalem to be brought to him—viz.,
those holy vessels which Nebuchadnezzar had seized when he exiled the
Jews from Jerusalem to Babylon. He then defiled the holy vessels by
drinking wine out of them, together with his 1,000 princes, his wives,
and his concubines.

\(3\) But when our God beheld this profanation, He was angry and jealous
(zealous) for His vessels, so He sent from His throne a scribe to write
a severe rebuke for the king, and to acquaint him with the judgment
which our God had decreed concerning his life and his kingdom. The
scribe accordingly wrote upon the wall in red ink by the lamp of the
king the following: 'He thought, He weighed, He separated.' The letters
were written in Hebrew characters, but the writing was Aramaic. When the
king saw the fingers writing—the other parts of the body he did not see,
for the fingers were terrible and beautiful—he became bewildered and
very much afraid, so that every limb of his body, his heart, and his
very bones trembled.
