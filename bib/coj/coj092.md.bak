LXXXVIII\. (1) The king then returned to Macedonia, and, having left
Phillipos in the land of Judah, he (Phillip) acted according to the word
of the king, and prohibited the people of Judah from studying the Torah
and from performing the service of their God. He supported the wicked
and the rebellious of our people, and slew many of the congregation of
the Ḥassidim.

children. They hanged them by their breasts, and hurled them with their
children from the top

of a tower; they burst open and died. (3) After this Eleazar, the chief
of the priests, of whom we have spoken as having gone to Egypt in the
days of Ptolemy, was captured and brought to Phillip. And Phillip said
to him, Eleazar, thou art a wise man and a man of understanding, now, do
not transgress the command of the king, but eat of the flesh of his
sacrifice.' But Eleazar replied, 'Far be it from me to set aside the
command of my God for the performance of the command of the king.' Then
did Phillip call him aside and say, 'Thou knowest that I have loved thee
now for many years, therefore I have pity for thy soul and for thy old
age. Now let a portion of the flesh of your own sacrifices which you are
allowed to eat be brought to thee, and eat it before the people so that
they will say thou eatest of the flesh of the king's sacrifice. By this
means thou canst save thy life and not die.'

\(4\) When Eleazar heard this he thought of the greatness of his honour
and of the sanctity of his glory, and said to Phillip, 'I am now ninety
years old, and have never yet served my God with deceit, nor is it meet
for me now to do so and to deceive man, for then the young men will say,
"Since Eleazar, although ninety years of age, has frustrated the law of
his God, we can also do so," and they will thus bring destruction upon
themselves. Now, far be it from me to defile my holiness, to taint the
purity of my old age, and to cause these young men with me to waver, and
give them the pretext for saying, "Eleazar, although ninety years of
age, has sinned against his God, and has chosen to serve the vanities of
the nations; let us do likewise." For even if I escape from your hands
to-day, I cannot escape God, for no man can, either living or dead,
since His dominion extends over the living to bring death upon them, and
over the dead to quicken them to life. I shall therefore die true to my
faith, and shall leave my power behind to my people and my young men, so
that when they see me give up my life so readily, they will desire to
follow my example, and thus keep their Torah precious, and will choose a
worthy death.'

\(5\) As soon, however, as Phillipos heard these words, he turned
exceedingly cruel, and commanded his men to bind the pious old man and
to beat him. They thereupon smote him with all manner of weapons without
pity, and he groaned, saying, 'O Lord my God, who hast caused me to
reach this old age, Thou knowest that I was able to deliver my soul from
such a death, but did not wish to do so on account of my love for Thee.
Now they smite so cruelly and fiercely that I would not be able to bear
it were it not for my fear of Thee, which renders them as nothing in my
eyes, and I suffer them willingly.' While he was still speaking these
words his life closed, and he left might to his people and power to his
young men.
