XLVII\. (1) At that time Moses used to tend the flocks of Reuel the
Midianite behind the wilderness of Sin, with his staff in his hand. But
the Lord was zealous for His people and His inheritance, and, hearing
their cry, said He would rescue them from the descendants of Ham, and
give them the land of Canaan. He appeared to Moses, His servant, in
Horeb, in a burning bush; but the fire did not consume the bush. Then
God called him from the midst of the bush, and commanded him to go down
to Egypt to Pharaoh, King of Egypt, and to ask him to send away His
chosen people as free men. He showed him signs and wonders to perform in
Egypt that they might believe that the Lord had sent him. God gave him
confidence by saying, 'Go, and return to Egypt, for those that sought
thy life are now dead, and they have no power to do thee harm.' (2)
Moses then returned to Midian, and related to his father-in-law all that
had happened. 'Go in peace,' said he. So Moses arose and went away with
his wife and sons. They lodged at a certain place, and an angel came
down and attacked him for his transgression of the covenant which God
made with Abraham His servant, in that he did not circumcise his eldest
son, and he wanted to slay him. Zipporah then immediately took one of
the sharp flint stones which she found there and circumcised her son,
and she rescued her husband from the power of the angel.

\(3\) As Aaron the Levite was walking in Egypt by the river God appeared
to him, and said, 'Go now, and meet thy brother Moses in the
wilderness.' He accordingly went and met him on the mountain of God, and
kissed him. On beholding the woman and her children, he said to Moses,
'Who are these?' 'These are,' said he, 'my wife

<span id="page_123">p. 123</span>

and sons whom God gave me in Midian.' But Aaron was displeased, and he
told him to send the woman and her sons back to her father's house. This
Moses did. And Zipporah and her sons remained in the house of Reuel, her
father, until the Lord visited His people, and delivered them from Egypt
from the hand of Pharaoh. (4) Moses and Aaron then went alone to Egypt
to the Israelites, whom they told all that the Lord had spoken. Thereat
the people exceedingly rejoiced. The next morning they rose up early and
went to Pharaoh's house, taking the staff of God with them.

\(5\) When they came to the gate of the king's palace they saw there two
young lions bound in iron chains. No one could enter or pass out from
within unless the king commanded it. The keepers on seeing them loosened
the chains, and by charms set the lions free to pounce upon them; but
Moses hastily waved his wand upon them, and Moses and Aaron entered the
king's palace, followed by the young lions playing round them as a dog
plays on seeing its master coming home from the field. When Pharaoh saw
this he was greatly astonished, and still more confused on account of
these men, whose appearance was like that of the children of God. The
king then said to them, 'What do you wish?' And Moses said, 'The Lord
God of the Hebrews has sent us to thee, saying, "Send out My people,
that they may serve Me."' Pharaoh was greatly afraid of them, and told
them to go away and come again to-morrow, which they did.

\(6\) When they were gone Pharaoh ordered Bala‘am the enchanter, and
Janis (\#\#\#) and Jambris (\#\#\#), his sons, the wizards, and all the
magicians of Egypt to be summoned before him. He then related to them
what these men had spoken. The magicians then asked, 'How did these men
pass the lions that were chained at the gate of the palace?' 'They waved
their staves upon the lions,' said the king, 'and they let them loose,
and they followed them just as dogs who were pleased to meet them.'
'They are nothing else than wizards like ourselves,' said Bala‘am. 'Send
now

<span id="page_124">p. 124</span>

after them and let them come, and we shall try them.' The king acted
accordingly.

\(7\) Taking the staff, they came before the king, and repeated the
words which they had spoken at first. 'But how can one believe,' said
Pharaoh, 'that you are messengers of God, and that by His word you have
come here? Give us a sign and we shall believe you.' Aaron then threw
his staff upon the ground, and it was immediately changed into a
serpent. The magicians, seeing this, did the same by their incantations,
and the staff of each one of them became a serpent; but Aaron's serpent
at that moment lifted its head, and, opening its mouth, swallowed up the
serpents of Pharaoh's magicians. Bala‘am the wizard, seeing this, said,
'This has been done from time immemorial, that one serpent should
swallow up his neighbour just as the fish swallow each other. But change
it back to a staff as we shall do, and then if thy staff is able to
swallow ours we shall thereby know that the Spirit of the Lord is with
thee; but if it cannot swallow them, then thou art a wizard as we are.'
Aaron then hastily took hold of the serpent by its tail, and it became a
stick again. This the magicians likewise did. Then Aaron, as previously,
cast his staff upon the ground, and it swallowed up those of the
magicians.

\(8\) Pharaoh then ordered the Book of Chronicles of the Kings of Egypt
to be brought to him; therein were contained the names of all the gods
of Egypt. When the list was read over to Pharaoh, he said, 'I do not
find your God written in this book, nor do I know Him.' 'The Lord God of
gods is His name,' replied they (Moses and Aaron). But who is the Lord,'
added Pharaoh, 'that I should listen to His voice and send Israel forth?
I do not know Him, and shall not allow the Israelites to go.' 'From the
days of our forefathers He has been called "The God of the Hebrews." Now
give us permission to go a journey of three days in the wilderness to
sacrifice unto the Lord, for ever since we came down to Egypt He has not
received from our hands a burnt offering, meal offering, or sacrifice.

<span id="page_125">p. 125</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> If, however, thou
wilt not let us go forth, the Lord will assuredly wax angry and smite
the land of Egypt with pestilence or with the sword.'

\(9\) 'Tell us something of His might and power,' said Pharaoh. 'He
created the heavens and all their host; the earth and all it contains;
the seas with all their fishes. He it was who formed the light and who
created the darkness; who caused the rain to fall upon the earth to
irrigate it. He caused the young plants and the grass to spring forth.
He created man, animals, the beasts in the forest, the birds in the
heavens, and the fish in the seas. Through Him they live, through Him
they die. Did He not create thee in the womb of thy mother, and give
thee the spirit of life? did He not make thee grow up, and place thee on
the royal throne of Egypt? He shall also take away thy spirit and thy
soul, and return thee to the dust from which thou wast taken.' The anger
of Pharaoh was kindled, and he said, 'Who is there among all the gods of
the people that can do this? Behold, I it was who created the river, and
who created myself.' He then drove them out of his presence, and from
that day he made the slavery more oppressive than heretofore.
