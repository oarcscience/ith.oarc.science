# The Vulgate

------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Jump to Contents](#index)

This is the Latin Bible, or 'Vulgate'. Translated from the Hebrew and
Aramaic by Jerome between 382 and 405 CE, this text became knowns as the
'versio vulgata', which means 'common translation'. 'Vulgate' should not
to be confused with the term 'vulgar', which has taken on a divergent
meaning in modern English.

The collection and order of the books which make up this version of the
Bible differs slightly from the ones in the [King James
Version](../kjv/index), it includes several of the
[Apocrypha](../apo/index).

The Vulgate was the standard version of the Bible for Roman Catholics
for over one and a half millenia. Since Latin was only studied by
priests and scholars, the vast majority of people could not read or
understand the Vulgate, even though they would hear passages from it
every time they went to church.

Until 1450, when Gutenberg printed this text, copies were also very rare
and expensive. During the Protestant reformation in the 14th and 15th
centuries, the Bible was finally translated into modern languages,
against great resistance from the Church. Finally in the mid-20th
Century, the Roman Catholic church abandoned the use of Latin for
liturgy. However, this remains one of the most historically important
Latin texts.

The Latin text presented here and in the Polyglot Bible is based on the
text of the 1598 Vulgate, which was used as the standard text of the
Vulgate until 1979. It is derived from data files created by the
Clementine Vulgate Project (for more information, see
https://vulsearch.sourceforge.net/text.html), which have been released
into the public domain.
