### [4 Kings (2 Kings) Chapter 13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#001.md)

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 13:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">kg2 13:6</span></span>

The grove - Which Ahab had planted for the worship of Baal, and which
should have been destroyed, [Deu 7:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#005.md).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 13:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">kg2 13:7</span></span>

He - The king of Syria. People - Of his army, or men of war.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 13:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">kg2 13:8</span></span>

His might - For though his success was not good, he shewed much personal
valour. Which is noted to intimate, that the Israelites were not
conquered, because of the cowardice of their king, but merely from the
righteous judgment of God, who was now resolved to reckon with them for
their apostacy.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 13:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">kg2 13:14</span></span>

Fallen sick, &c. - He lived long: for it was sixty years since he was
first called to be a prophet. It was a great mercy to Israel and
especially to the sons of the prophets, that he was continued so long, a
burning and a shining light. Elijah finished his testimony, in a fourth
part of that time. God's prophets have their day set them, longer or
shorter, as infinite wisdom sees fit. But all the latter part of his
time, from the anointing of Jehu, which was forty five years before
Joash began his reign, we find no mention of him, or of any thing he
did, 'till we find him here upon his death bed. Yet he might be useful
to the last, tho' not so famous as he had sometimes been.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 13:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">kg2 13:17</span></span>

Eastward - Toward Syria, which lay north - eastward, from the land of
Israel: this arrow is shot against the Syrians, as a token what God
intended to do against them.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 13:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">kg2 13:18</span></span>

Smite - The former sign portended victory, this was to declare the
number of the victories.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 13:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">kg2 13:20</span></span>

Moabites invaded - The mentioning this immediately on the death of
Elisha intimates, that the removal of God's faithful prophets, is a
presage of judgments approaching.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 13:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">kg2 13:21</span></span>

He revived - Which miracle God wrought, to do honour to that great
prophet, and that by this seal he might confirm his doctrine, to
strengthen the faith of Joash, and of the Israelites, in this promise of
their success against the Syrians; and in the midst of all their
calamities to comfort such Israelites as were Elisha's followers, with
the hopes of eternal life, whereof this was a manifest pledge, and to
awaken the rest of that people to a due care and preparation for it.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 13:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">kg2 13:23</span></span>

Had compassion - The slowness of God's process against sinners even when
they remain impenitent must be construed to the advantage of his mercy,
not the impeachment of his justice.
