### [Psalms Chapter 51](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#001)

[Psalms 51:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 51:4</span></span>

Thee only - Which is not to be, understood absolutely, because he had
sinned against Bathsheba and Uriah, and many others; but comparatively.
So the sense is, though I have sinned against my own conscience, and
against others; yet nothing is more grievous to me, than that I have
sinned against thee. Thy sight - With gross contempt of thee, whom I
knew to be a spectator of my most secret actions. Justified - This will
be the fruit of my sin, that whatsoever severities thou shalt use
towards me, it will be no blemish to thy righteousness, but thy justice
will be glorified by all men. Speakest - Heb. in thy words, in all thy
threatenings denounced against me. Judgest - When thou dost execute thy
sentence upon me.

[Psalms 51:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 51:5</span></span>

Behold - Nor is this the only sin which I have reason to bewail before
thee; for this filthy stream leads me to a corrupt fountain: and upon a
review of my heart, I find, that this heinous crime, was the proper
fruit of my vile nature, which, ever was, and still is ready to commit
ten thousand sins, as occasion offers.

[Psalms 51:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 51:6</span></span>

Truth - Uprightness of heart; and this may be added; as an aggravation
of the sinfulness of original corruption, because it is contrary to the
holy nature and will of God, which requires rectitude of heart: and, as
an aggravation of his actual sin, that it was committed against that
knowledge, which God had wrote in his heart.

[Psalms 51:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 51:7</span></span>

Hyssop - As lepers, are by thy appointment purified by the use of hyssop
and other things, so do thou cleanse me a leprous and polluted creature,
by thy grace, and by that blood of Christ, which is signified by those
ceremonial usages.

[Psalms 51:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 51:8</span></span>

Joy - By thy spirit, seal the pardon of my sins on my conscience, which
will fill me with joy. Rejoice - That my heart which hath been sorely
wounded may be comforted.

[Psalms 51:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 51:10</span></span>

Create - Work in me an holy frame of heart, whereby my inward filth may
be purged away. Right - Heb. firm or constant, that my resolution may be
fixed and unmoveable. Spirit - Temper or disposition of soul.

[Psalms 51:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 51:12</span></span>

The joy - The comfortable sense of thy saving grace, promised and
vouchsafed to me, both for my present and everlasting salvation. Free -
Or, ingenuous, or liberal, or princely. Which he seems to oppose to his
own base and illiberal and disingenuous and servile spirit, which he had
discovered in his wicked practices: a spirit, which may free me from the
bondage of sin, and enable me chearfully to run the way of God's
precepts.

[Psalms 51:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">psa 51:14</span></span>

Thy righteousness - Thy clemency and goodness.

[Psalms 51:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">psa 51:15</span></span>

My lips - Which are shut with shame and grief.

[Psalms 51:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">psa 51:16</span></span>

Not sacrifice - This is not to be understood absolutely, with respect to
David's crimes, which were not to be expiated by any sacrifice.

[Psalms 51:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">psa 51:17</span></span>

A broken spirit - This is of more value than many sacrifices.

[Psalms 51:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">psa 51:18</span></span>

Good pleasure - Thy free and rich mercy. Build - Perfect the walls and
buildings of that city, and especially let the temple be built,
notwithstanding my sins.
