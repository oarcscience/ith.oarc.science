### [Job Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#001.md)

[Job 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">job 2:3</span></span>

Still - Notwithstanding all his afflictions, and thy suggestion to the
contrary. Movedst - This, as the rest of this representation, is not to
be understood literally: But the design is to signify both the devil's
restless malice in promoting man's misery and God's permission of it for
wise and holy ends.

[Job 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">job 2:4</span></span>

Skin, &c. - The sense is, this is so far from being an evidence of Job's
sincere and generous piety, that it is only an act of mere self - love;
he is contented with the loss of his estate, and children too, so long
as he sleeps in a whole skin; and he is well pleased, that thou wilt
accept of these a ransom in his stead; and it is not true patience which
makes him seem to bear his crosses so submissively, but policy, that he
may appease thy wrath against him, and prevent those farther plagues,
which, for his hypocrisy, he fears thou wilt otherwise bring upon his
own carcase.

[Job 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">job 2:6</span></span>

In thine hand - If God did not chain up the roaring lion, how soon would
he devour us! As far as he permits the wrath of Satan and wicked men, to
proceed against his people, he will make it turn to his praise and
theirs, and the remainder thereof he will restrain. Job, in being thus
maligned of Satan, was a type of Christ. He had permission to bruise his
heel, to touch his bone and his flesh; yea, and his life also; because
by dying he was to do what Job could not do, to destroy him that had the
power of death.

[Job 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">job 2:7</span></span>

Boils - Like those inflicted upon the Egyptians, which are expressed by
the same word, and threatened to apostate Israelites, [Deu
28:27](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#027.md), whereby he was made loathsome
to himself, and to his nearest relations, and filled with consuming
pains in his body, and no less torments and anguish in his mind.

[Job 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">job 2:8</span></span>

Scrape - This he did not with soft linen clothes, either because he had
not now a sufficient quantity of them; or because therein he must have
had the help of others who abhorred to come near him. Nor with his own
hands or fingers, which were also ulcerous, and so unfit for that use;
but with potsherds, either because they were next at hand, and ready for
his present use; or in token of his deep humiliation under God's hand,
which made him decline all things that favoured of tenderness and
delicacy. Heb. in dust or ashes, as mourners used to do. If God lay him
among the ashes, there he will contentedly sit down. A low spirit
becomes low circumstances, and will help to reconcile us to them.

[Job 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">job 2:9</span></span>

Then said his wife - Whom Satan spared, to be a troubler and tempter to
him. It is his policy, to send his temptations by the hands of those
that are dear to us. We must therefore carefully watch, that we be not
drawn to any evil, by them whom we love and value the most. Die - I see
thou art set upon blessing of God, thou blessest God for giving, and
thou blessest God for taking away, and thou art still blessing God for
thy loathsome diseases, and he rewards thee accordingly, giving thee
more and more of that kind of mercy for which thou blessest him. Go on
therefore in thy generous course, and bless God, and die as a fool
dieth.

[Job 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">job 2:10</span></span>

Shall we - Shall we poor worms give laws to our supreme Lord, and oblige
him never to afflict us? And shall not those great and manifold mercies,
which from time to time God hath given us, compensate these short
afflictions? Ought we not to bless God for those mercies which we did
not deserve; and contentedly bear those corrections which we do deserve.
And if we receive so much good for the body, shall we not receive some
good for our souls? That is, some affliction, whereby we may be made
partakers of his holiness? Let murmuring therefore, as well as boasting,
be forever excluded. Sin with his lips - By any reflections upon God, by
any impatient or unbecoming expression.

[Job 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">job 2:11</span></span>

They - Who were persons eminent for birth and quality, for wisdom and
knowledge, and for the profession of the true religion, being probably
of the posterity of Abraham, a - kin to Job, and living in the same
country. Eliphaz descended from Teman, the grandson of Esau, [Gen
36:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#011.md). Bildad probably from Shuah,
Abraham's son by Keturah, [Gen 25:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#002.md).
Zophar is thought to be same with Zepho, ([Gen
36:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#011)..md) a descendant from Esau. The
preserving of so much wisdom and piety among those who were not children
of the promise, was an happy presage of God's grace to the Gentiles,
when the partition wall should be taken down.

[Job 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">job 2:13</span></span>

Upon the ground - In the posture of mourners condoling with him. Seven
days - Which was the usual time of mourning for the dead, and therefore
proper both for Job's children, and for Job himself, who was in a manner
dead, while he lived: not that they continued in this posture so long
together, which the necessities of nature could not bear; but they spent
the greatest part of that time in sitting with him, and silent mourning
over him. None spake - About his afflictions and the causes of them. The
reason of this silence was the greatness of their grief for him, and
their surprize and astonishment at his condition; because they thought
it convenient to give him time to vent his own sorrows, and because as
yet they knew not what to say to him: for though they had ever esteemed
him to be a truly good man, and came with full purpose to comfort him,
yet the prodigious greatness of his miseries, and that hand of God which
they perceived in them, made them now question his sincerity, so that
they could not comfort him as they had intended, and yet were loth to
grieve him with reproofs.
