that he may more suddenly and surely lay hold on his prey.

because the oppressed were destitute of all other succours. Fatherless -
Of such as have no friend or helper, one kind of them being put for all.

faith and hope for the future. His land - Out of Canaan, which God calls
his land, because he gave it to them, and fixed his presence and
dwelling in it.

wilt hear.
