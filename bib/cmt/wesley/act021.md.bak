### [Acts Chapter 21](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#001.md)

[Acts 21:1](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">act 21:1</span></span>

And when we were torn away from the in - Not without doing violence both
to ourselves and them.

[Acts 21:3](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">act 21:3</span></span>

We landed at Tyre - That there should be Christians there was foretold,
[Psa 87:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa087.htm#004.md). What we read in that psalm
of the Philistines and Ethiopians also may be compared with [Act
8:40](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#040.md); [Act
27:4](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#004.md).

[Acts 21:4](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">act 21:4</span></span>

And finding disciples, we tarried there seven days - ln order to spend a
Sabbath with them. Who told Paul by the Spirit - That afflictions
awaited him at Jerusalem. This was properly what they said by the
Spirit. They themselves advised him not to go up. The disciples seemed
to understand their prophetic impulse to be an intimation from the
Spirit, that Paul, if he were so minded, might avoid the danger, by not
going to Jerusalem.

[Acts 21:7](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">act 21:7</span></span>

Having finished our voyage - From Macedonia, [Act
20:6](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#006.md), we came to Ptolemais - A
celebrated city on the sea coast, anciently called Accos. It is now,
like many other once noble cities, only a heap of ruins.

[Acts 21:8](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">act 21:8</span></span>

We came to Cesarea - So called from a stately temple which Herod the
Great dedicated there to Augustus Cesar. It was the place where the
Roman governor of Judea generally resided and kept his court. The
evangelist, who was one of the seven deacons - An evangelist is a
preacher of the Gospel to those who had never heard it, as Philip had
done to the Samaritans, to the Ethiopian eunuch, and to all the towns
from Azotus to Cesarea, [Act 8:5](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#005.md), [Act
8:26](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#026.md), [Act
8:40](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#040.md). It is not unlikely he spent the
following years preaching in Tyre and Sidon, and the other heathen
cities in the neighbourhood of Galilee, his house being at Cesarea, a
convenient situation for that purpose. We abode with him - We lodged at
his house during our stay at Cesarea.

[Acts 21:10](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">act 21:10</span></span>

A certain prophet came - The nearer the event was, the more express were
the predictions which prepared Paul for it.

[Acts 21:11](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">act 21:11</span></span>

Binding his own feet and hands - In the manner that malefactors were
wont to be bound when apprehended. So shall the Jews bind the man whose
girdle this is - St. Paul's bonds were first particularly foretold at
Cesarea, to which he afterward came in bonds, [Act
23:33](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#033.md).

[Acts 21:12](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">act 21:12</span></span>

Both we, (his fellow travellers,) and they of the place, besought him
not to go up to Jerusalem - St. Paul knew that this prediction had the
force of a command. They did not know this.

[Acts 21:13](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">act 21:13</span></span>

Breaking my heart - For the apostles themselves were not void of human
affections. I am ready not only to be bound, but to die - And to him
that is ready for it, the burden is light.

[Acts 21:14](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">act 21:14</span></span>

And when he would not be persuaded - This was not obstinacy, but true
Christian resolution. We should never be persuaded, either to do evil,
or to omit doing any good which is in our power; saying, the will of the
Lord be done - Which they were satisfied Paul knew.

[Acts 21:15](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">act 21:15</span></span>

We took up our carriages - Our baggage; which probably went by sea
before. What they took with them now in particular was the alms they
were carrying to Jerusalem, [Act
24:17](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#017.md).

[Acts 21:16](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">act 21:16</span></span>

The disciples brought us to one Mnason, a Cyprian, an old disciple - He
was a native of Cyprus, but an inhabitant of Jerusalem, and probably one
of the first converts there.

[Acts 21:18](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">act 21:18</span></span>

Paul went in with us - That it might appear we are all of one mind, to
James - Commonly called the Lord's brother; the only apostle then
presiding over the Churches in Judea.

[Acts 21:20](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">act 21:20</span></span>

They are all zealous for the law - For the whole Mosaic dispensation.
How astonishing is this! Did none of the apostles, beside St. Paul, know
that this dispensation was now abolished? And if they did both know and
testify this, how came their hearers not to believe them?

[Acts 21:21](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">act 21:21</span></span>

They have been informed concerning thee, that thou teachest the Jews -
not to circumcise their children, nor to walk after the customs - Of the
Mosaic law. And so undoubtedly he did. And so he wrote to all the
Churches in Galatia, among whom were many Jews. Yea, and James himself
had long before assented to Peter, affirming before all the apostles and
all the brethren, [Act 15:10](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#010.md), That
this very law was a yoke which (said he) neither our fathers nor we were
able to bear - Amazing! that they did not know this! Or, that if they
did, they did not openly testify it at all hazards, to every Jewish
convert in Jerusalem!

[Acts 21:22](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">act 21:22</span></span>

What is it therefore - What is to be done? The multitude must needs come
together - They will certainly gather together in a tumultuous manner,
unless they be some way pacified.

[Acts 21:23](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">act 21:23</span></span>

Therefore - To obviate their prejudice against thee: do this that we say
to thee - Doubtless they meant this advice well: but could Paul follow
it in godly sincerity? Was not the yielding so far to the judgment of
others too great a deference to be paid to any mere men?

[Acts 21:24](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">act 21:24</span></span>

And all will know - that thou thyself walkest orderly, keeping the law -
Ought he not, without any reverence to man, where the truth of God was
so deeply concerned, to have answered plainly, I do not keep the Mosaic
law; neither need any of you. Yea, Peter doth not keep the law. And God
himself expressly commanded him not to keep it; ordering him to go in to
men uncircumcised, and to eat with them, [Act
11:3](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#003.md), which the law utterly forbids.

[Acts 21:26](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">act 21:26</span></span>

Then Paul took the men - Yielding his own judgment to their advice,
which seemed to flow not out of spiritual but carnal wisdom; seeming to
be what he really was not: making as if he believed the law still in
force. Declaring - Giving notice to the priests in waiting, that he
designed to accomplish the days of purification, till all the sacrifice
should be offered, as the Mosaic law required, [Num
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#013.md).

[Acts 21:27](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">act 21:27</span></span>

And when the seven days were about to be accomplished - When after
giving notice to the priests, they were entering upon the accomplishment
of those days. It was toward the beginning of them that Paul was seized.
The Jews that were from Asia - Some of those Jews who came from Asia to
the feast.

[Acts 21:28](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">act 21:28</span></span>

Against the people - The Jewish nation; and the law - Of Moses; and this
place - The temple. Yea, and hath even brought Greeks into the temple -
They might come into the outer court. But they imagined Paul had brought
then into the inner temple, and had thereby polluted it.

[Acts 21:30](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">act 21:30</span></span>

And immediately the gates were shut - Both to prevent any farther
violation of the temple; and to prevent Paul's taking sanctuary at the
horns of the altar.

[Acts 21:31](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">act 21:31</span></span>

And as they went about to kill him - It was a rule among the Jews, that
any uncircumcised person who came into the inner temple, might be stoned
without farther process. And they seemed to think Paul, who brought such
in thither, deserved no better treatment. Word came to the tribune - A
cohort or detachment of soldiers, belonging to the Roman legion, which
lodged in the adjacent castle of Antonia, were stationed on feast days
near the temple, to prevent disorders. It is evident, Lysias himself was
not present, when the tumult began. Probably he was the oldest Roman
tribune (or colonel) then at Jerusalem. And as such he was the
commanding officer of the legion quartered at the castle.

[Acts 21:33](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">act 21:33</span></span>

Then the tribune - Having made his way through the multitude, came near
and took him - And how many great ends of providence were answered by
this imprisonment? This was not only a means of preserving his life,
(after he had suffered severely for worldly prudence,) but gave him an
opportunity of preaching the Gospel safely, in spite of all tumult, [Act
22:22](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#022.md), yea, and that in those places
to which otherwise he could have had no access, [Act
21:40](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#040.md). And commanded him to be bound
with two chains - Taking it for granted he was some notorious offender.
And thus the prophecy of Agabus was fulfilled, though by the hands of a
Roman.

[Acts 21:35](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">act 21:35</span></span>

When he came upon the stairs - The castle of Antonia was situate on a
rock fifty cubits high, at that corner of the outward temple, where the
western and northern porticos joined, to each of which there were stairs
descending from it.

[Acts 21:37](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">act 21:37</span></span>

As Paul was about to be brought into the castle - The wisdom of God
taught to make use of that very time and place.

[Acts 21:38](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#038.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">act 21:38</span></span>

Art not thou that Egyptian - Who came into Judea when Felix had been
some years governor there! Calling himself a prophet, he drew much
people after him; and having brought them through the wilderness, led
them to Mount Olivet, promising that the walls of the city should fall
down before them. But Felix marching out of Jerusalem against him, his
followers quickly dispersed, many of whom were taken or slain; but he
himself made his escape.

[Acts 21:40](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#040.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">act 21:40</span></span>

In the Hebrew tongue - That dialect of it, which was then commonly
spoken at Jerusalem.
