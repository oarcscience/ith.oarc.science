### [4 Kings (2 Kings) Chapter 23](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#001.md)

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 23:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">kg2 23:2</span></span>

Prophets - Either Jeremiah, Zephaniah, Urijah: or, the sons of the
prophets. It seems he read it himself. Josiah did not think it beneath
him, to be a reader, any more than Solomon did to be a preacher, and
David to be even a door keeper in the house of God. All people are
concerned to know the scripture, and all in authority, to spread the
knowledge of it.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 23:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">kg2 23:3</span></span>

Stood - They declared their consent to it, and their concurrence with
the king in that act, which possibly they did by standing up, as the
king himself stood when he took it. It is of good use, with all possible
solemnity, to oblige ourselves to our duty. And he that bears an honest
heart, does not startle at assurances.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 23:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">kg2 23:4</span></span>

Second order - Either those two who were next in degree to the high -
priest, and in case of sickness were to manage his work: or the heads of
the twenty four courses which David had appointed. The grove - The image
of the grove: it being most frequent to call images by the names of the
persons or things which they represent. The fields - Adjoining to the
brook of Kidron. To Beth - el - To shew his abhorrence of them, and that
he would not give the ashes of them a place in his kingdom: and to
pollute and disgrace that place which had been the chief seat and throne
of idolatry.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 23:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">kg2 23:5</span></span>

Priests - Heb. the Chemarim; the highest rank of priests, employed in
the highest work, which was to burn incense.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 23:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">kg2 23:6</span></span>

The people - Of that people, those idolatrous people, as it is
explained, [Ch2 34:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2034.htm#004.md).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 23:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">kg2 23:7</span></span>

Sodomites - Sodomy was a part of idol - worship, being done to the
honour of some of their idols, and by the appointment of those impure
and diabolical spirits, which were worshipped in their idols. Hangings -
Or, curtains, either to draw before the idols which were worshipped in
the grove, to preserve them from defilement, or to gain more reverence
for them: Or, garments for the service of the grove, for the idols or
the priests belonging to them. Heb. houses, that is, either little
chappels made of woven work, like those which were made of silver, [Act
19:24](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#024.md), within which there were some
representations of their grove - idols: or rather, tents made of those
curtains for the use above - mentioned.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 23:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">kg2 23:8</span></span>

Priests - Belonging to the high - places following, whether such as
worshipped idols; or such as worshipped God in those forbidden places.
Defiled - By burning dead mens bones upon them, or by putting them to
some other unclean use. From Geba - The northern border of the kingdom
of Judah. Beer - sheba - The southern border, from one end to the other.
Gates - Which were erected by the gates of the city here mentioned, to
the honour of their tutelary gods, whom after the manner of the heathen
they owned for the protectors of their city and habitations. The
governor - This circumstance is noted to shew Josiah's great zeal and
impartiality, in rooting out all monuments of idolatry, without any
respects unto those great persons who were concerned in them.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 23:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">kg2 23:9</span></span>

The priest - Who worshipped the true God there. In Jerusalem - Were not
suffered to come thither to the exercise of their priestly function; as
a just punishment for the corruption of God's worship, and the
transgression of so plain and positive a law of God, [Deu
12:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#011.md), which was much worse in them
who had more knowledge to discern the will of God, and more obligations
to observe it. Did eat - Of the meal - offerings, allotted to the
priests, wherein there was to be no leaven, [Lev
2:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#004.md), [Lev
2:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#010.md), and consequently of other
provisions belonging to the priests, which are contained under this one
kind. Thus their spiritual blemish puts them into the very same state
which corporal blemishes brought them, [Lev
21:17](../../../bib/kjv/lev021.htm#017.md), &c. And thus he mitigates their
punishment: he shuts them out from spiritual services, but allows them
necessary provisions.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 23:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">kg2 23:10</span></span>

Topheth - Very near Jerusalem, where was the image of Molech, to whom
some sacrificed their children, burning them in the fire, others
dedicated them, making them pass between two fires. It is supposed to be
called Topheth, from toph, a drum; because they beat drums at the
burning of the children, that their shrieks might not be heard.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 23:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">kg2 23:11</span></span>

Horses - Such the eastern nations used to consecrate to the sun, to
signify the swiftness of his motion. The sun - Either, to be sacrificed
to the sun: or, to draw those chariots in which the kings, or some other
in their stead, went forth every morning to worship the rising sun: for
both these were the customs of the Armenians and Persians, as Xenophon
testifies. Entering in - By the gate of the outward court of the temple.
Chamberlain - Or, officer, to whom the care of these horses were
committed. Suburbs - Of the temple: in certain outward buildings
belonging to the temple. Chariots - Which were made for the worship of
the sun.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 23:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">kg2 23:12</span></span>

The top - Upon the roof of the king's house. They were so mad upon their
idols, that they were not content with all their publick high places and
altars, but made others upon their house - tops, for the worship of the
heavenly bodies. Cast - To shew his detestation of them: and to abolish
the very remembrance of them.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 23:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">kg2 23:13</span></span>

Corruption - The mount of olives, called the mount of corruption, for
the gross idolatry there practiced. Which - Not the same individual
altars; which doubtless either Solomon upon his repentance, or some
other of Josiah's predecessors had taken away, but other altars built by
Manasseh or Amon, which because erected by Solomon's example, and for
the same use, and in the same place, are called by his name: this brand
is left by the Holy Ghost upon his name and memory, as a just punishment
of that abominable practice, and a mean to deter others from the like.
Abomination - The idol, so called, because it was abominable, and made
them abominable to God.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 23:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">kg2 23:14</span></span>

Men - Of the idolatrous priests, which he caused to be taken out of
their graves, [Kg2 23:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#018.md). As he
carried the ashes of the images to the graves, to mingle them with dead
mens bones, so he carried dead mens bones to the places where the images
had been, that both ways idolatry might be rendered loathsome. Dead men
and dead gods were indeed much alike, and fittest to go together.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 23:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">kg2 23:15</span></span>

Beth - el - Probably this city was now under the kingdom of Judah, to
which it was added by Abijah long since. And it is probable, since the
ten tribes were carried away, many cities had put themselves under the
protection of Judah. The golden calf, it seems, was gone; but Josiah
would leave no remains of that idolatry.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 23:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">kg2 23:16</span></span>

Himself - Josiah's care and zeal was so great, that he would not trust
his officers with these things, but would see them done with his own
eyes. These words - Three hundred years before it was done.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 23:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">kg2 23:20</span></span>

The priests - By this relation it appears, that after the departure of
the king of Assyria, divers of the Israelites who had retired to other
parts, and kept themselves out of the conqueror's hands, returned
together with their priests to their own land, and to their old trade,
worshipping idols; to whom, peradventure, they ascribed this their
deliverance from that judgment which Jehovah had brought upon them. And
burnt - According to that famous prophecy, [Kg1
13:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1013.htm#001.md).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 23:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">kg2 23:22</span></span>

Such a passover - Celebrated with such solemn care, and great
preparation, and numerous sacrifices, and universal joy of all good men;
which was much the greater, because of their remembrance of the former
wicked and miserable times under Manasseh, and Amon; and the good hopes
they now had of the happy establishment of their nation, and the true
religion; and of the prevention of God's judgments denounced against
them. Judges - Or, from the days of Samuel, the last of the judges; as
it is expressed [Ch2 35:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch2035.htm#018.md). None of
the kings had taken such care to prepare themselves, the priests, and
people, and accurately to observe all the rites, and diligently to purge
out all uncleanness, and to renew their covenant with God. And
undoubtedly God was pleased to recompense their zeal in destroying
idolatry with uncommon tokens of his presence and favour. All this
concurred to make it such a passover as had not been, even in the days
of Hezekiah.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 23:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">kg2 23:24</span></span>

Images, &c. - Three words noting the same thing, to shew, That all the
instruments and monuments of idolatry were destroyed, as God had
commanded. Spied - All that were discovered; not only such as were in
the place of worship, but such as their priests or zealots had removed,
and endeavoured to hide.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 23:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">kg2 23:25</span></span>

No king - For his diligent study in God's law, and his exact care, and
unwearied industry, and fervent zeal, in rooting out idolators, and all
kinds and appearances of idolatry, not only in Judah, but in Israel
also; and in the establishment of the true religion in all his
dominions, and in the conforming of his own life, and his peoples too,
(as far as he could) to the holy law of God: though Hezekiah might excel
him in some particulars.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 23:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">kg2 23:26</span></span>

Notwithstanding - Because though the king was most hearty in his
repentance and acceptable to God, and therefore the judgment was delayed
for his time; yet the people were in general corrupt, and secretly
averse from Josiah's pious reformation, as appears from the complaints
of the prophets, especially Jeremiah and Zephaniah, against them: and by
the following history, wherein we see, that as soon as ever Josiah was
gone, his children, and the princes, and the people, suddenly and
greedily returned to their former abominations. Because - The sins of
Manasseh, and for the men of his generation; who concurred with him in
his idolatrous and cruel practices, are justly punished in this
generation: because of God's sovereign right of punishing sinners when
he sees fit: because of that publick declaration of God, that he would
visit the iniquity of the fathers upon the children: and principally,
because these men had never sincerely repented of their own, nor of
their fathers sins.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 23:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">kg2 23:27</span></span>

I said - Upon the conditions in sundry places expressed, which they
broke, and therefore God justly made them to know his breach of promise.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 23:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">kg2 23:29</span></span>

The king, &c. - The king of Babylon, who having formerly rebelled
against the Assyrian had now conquered him; as appears by the course of
the sacred, and the concurrence of the prophane history; and therefore
is here and elsewhere called the Assyrian, and the king of Assyria,
because now he was the head of that empire. Euphrates - Against
Carchemish by Euphrates, as it is expressed, [Ch2
35:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch2035.htm#020.md), which the Assyrian had taken
from Pharaoh's confederates, who therefore sends forces against the
Assyrian, that he might both help them, and secure himself. Josiah went
- Either to defend his own country from Pharaoh's incursions; or to
assist the king of Babylon, with whom he seems to have been in league.
Slew - Gave him his death wound there; though he died not 'till he came
to Jerusalem. Seen him - When he fought with him, or in the first onset.
It does not appear, that Josiah had any clear call to engage in this
war; possibly he received his death wound, as a punishment of his
rashness.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 23:30](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">kg2 23:30</span></span>

Dead - Mortally wounded. Jehoahaz - Who was younger than Jehoiakim, yet
preferred by the people before the elder brother; either because
Jehoiakim refused the kingdom for fear of Pharaoh, whom he knew he
should hereby provoke. Or because Jehoahaz was the more stout and
warlike prince; whence he is called a lion, [Eze
19:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze019.htm#003.md).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 23:32](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">kg2 23:32</span></span>

His fathers - His grand - parents, Manasseh, and Amon. He restored that
idolatry which his father had destroyed. Jerusalem saw not a good day,
after Josiah was laid in his grave; but one trouble came after another,
'till within two and twenty years it was destroyed.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 23:33](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">kg2 23:33</span></span>

In bands - Either, because he presumed to take the kingdom without his
consent: or because he renewed the war against Pharaoh.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 23:34](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">kg2 23:34</span></span>

Jehoiakim - The giving of names was accounted an act of dominion; which
therefore parents did to their children, and conquerors to their vassals
or tributaries.
