rebellions of the children of Israel, begins as early, as their
beginning. So does the history of man's apostasy from his Maker. No

his rebellion. So we see here, it was with Israel; a people designed to
represent the body of mankind, both in their dealings with God, and in
God's dealing with them. Lifted up my hand - Or stretched out and made
bare my arm; that is, magnified my power for their deliverance. When I
lifted up mine hand - Shewed my power in performing my oath, and
assuring them of doing what was farther promised.
