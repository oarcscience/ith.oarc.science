<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">rut 3:1</A></FONT></span></p>Rest - A life of rest, and comfort, and safety, under the care of a good husband. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rut003.htm#002">Ruth 3:2</A></p>

<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rut003.htm#008">Ruth 3:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">rut 3:8</A></FONT></span></p>At midnight - He did not discover her sooner. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rut003.htm#009">Ruth 3:9</A></p>

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">rut 3:10</A></FONT></span></p>Shewed kindness - Both to thy deceased husband, the continuance of whose name and memory thou seekest; and to thy mother - in - law, whose commands thou hast punctually obeyed.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_013">rut 3:13</A></FONT></span></p>Perform, &amp;c. - Take thee to wife, to raise up seed to his brother. Bishop Hall sums up the matter thus. "Boaz, instead of touching her as a wanton, blesseth her as a father, encourages her as a friend, promises her as a kinsman, rewards her as a patron, and sends her away laden with hopes and gifts, no less chast, but more happy than she came. O admirable temperance, worthy the progenitor of him, in whose lips and heart there was no guile!"

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_016">rut 3:16</A></FONT></span></p>Who art thou? - This is not a question of doubting, but of wonder, as if she had said, Art thou in very deed my daughter? I can hardly believe it. How camest thou hither in this manner, and thus early?
