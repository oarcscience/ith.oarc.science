### [John Chapter 9](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#001.md)

[John 9:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">joh 9:2</span></span>

Who sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born blind? - That is,
was it for his own sins, or the sins of his parents? They suppose (as
many of the Jews did, though without any ground from Scripture) that he
might have sinned in a pre - existent state, before he came into the
world.

[John 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">joh 9:3</span></span>

Jesus answered, Neither hath this man sinned, nor his parents - It was
not the manner of our Lord to answer any questions that were of no use,
but to gratify an idle curiosity. Therefore he determines nothing
concerning this. The scope of his answer is, It was neither for any sins
of his own, nor yet of his parents; but that the power of God might be
displayed.

[John 9:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">joh 9:4</span></span>

The night is coming - Christ is the light. When the light is withdrawn
night comes, when no man can work - No man can do any thing toward
working out his salvation after this life is ended. Yet Christ can work
always. But he was not to work upon earth, only during the day, or
season which was appointed for him.

[John 9:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">joh 9:5</span></span>

I am the light of the world - I teach men inwardly by my Spirit, and
outwardly by my preaching, what is the will of God; and I show them, by
my example, how they must do it.

[John 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">joh 9:6</span></span>

He anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay - This might almost
have blinded a man that had sight. But what could it do toward curing
the blind? It reminds us that God is no farther from the event, when he
works either with, or without means, and that all the creatures are only
that which his almighty operation makes them.

[John 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">joh 9:7</span></span>

Go, wash at the pool of Siloam - Perhaps our Lord intended to make the
miracle more taken notice of. For a crowd of people would naturally
gather round him to observe the event of so strange a prescription, and
it is exceeding probable, the guide who must have led him in traversing
a great part of the city, would mention the errand he was going upon,
and so call all those who saw him to a greater attention. From the
fountain of Siloam, which was without the walls of Jerusalem, a little
stream flowed into the city, and was received in a kind of basin, near
the temple, and called the pool of Siloam. Which is, by interpretation,
Sent - And so was a type of the Messiah, who was sent of God. He went
and washed, and came seeing - He believed, and obeyed, and found a
blessing. Had he been wise in his own eyes, and reasoned, like Naaman,
on the impropriety of the means, he had justly been left in darkness.
Lord, may our proud hearts be subdued to the methods of thy recovering
grace! May we leave thee to choose how thou wilt bestow favours, which
it is our highest interest to receive on any terms.

[John 9:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">joh 9:11</span></span>

A man called Jesus - He seems to have been before totally ignorant of
him.

[John 9:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">joh 9:14</span></span>

Anointing the eyes - With any kind of medicine on the Sabbath, was
particularly forbidden by the tradition of the elders.

[John 9:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">joh 9:16</span></span>

This man is not of God - Not sent of God. How can a man that is a sinner
- That is, one living in wilful sin, do such miracles?

[John 9:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">joh 9:17</span></span>

What sayest thou of him, for that he hath opened thine eyes? - What
inference dost thou draw herefrom?

[John 9:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">joh 9:22</span></span>

He should be put out of the synagogue - That is be excommunicated.

[John 9:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">joh 9:27</span></span>

Are ye also - As well as I, at length convinced and willing to be his
disciples?

[John 9:29](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">joh 9:29</span></span>

We know not whence he is - By what power and authority he does these
things.

[John 9:30](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">joh 9:30</span></span>

The man answered - Utterly illiterate as he was. And with what strength
and clearness of reason! So had God opened the eyes of his
understanding, as well as his bodily eyes. Why, herein is a marvellous
thing, that ye - The teachers and guides of the people, should not know,
that a man who has wrought a miracle, the like of which was never heard
of before, must be from heaven, sent by God.

[John 9:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">joh 9:31</span></span>

We - Even we of the populace, know that God heareth not sinners - Not
impenitent sinners, so as to answer their prayers in this manner. The
honest courage of this man in adhering to the truth, though he knew the
consequence, [Joh 9:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#022.md), gives him
claim to the title of a confessor.

[John 9:33](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">joh 9:33</span></span>

He could do nothing - Of this kind; nothing miraculous.

[John 9:34](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">joh 9:34</span></span>

Born in sin - And therefore, they supposed, born blind. They cast him
out - Of the synagogue; excommunicated him.

[John 9:35](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">joh 9:35</span></span>

Having found him - For he had sought him.

[John 9:36](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">joh 9:36</span></span>

Who is he, that I may believe? - This implies some degree of faith
already. He was ready to receive whatever Jesus said.

[John 9:37](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">joh 9:37</span></span>

Lord, I believe - What an excellent spirit was this man of! Of so deep
and strong an understanding; (as he had just shown to the confusion of
the Pharisees,) and yet of so teachable a temper!

[John 9:39](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#039.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">joh 9:39</span></span>

For judgment am I come into the world - That is, the consequence of my
coming will be, that by the just judgment of God, while the blind in
body and soul receive their sight, they who boast they see, will be
given up to still greater blindness than before.

[John 9:41](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#041.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">joh 9:41</span></span>

If ye had been blind - Invincibly ignorant; if ye had not had so many
means of knowing: ye would have had no sin - Comparatively to what ye
have now. But now ye say - Ye yourselves acknowledge, Ye see, therefore
your sin remaineth - Without excuse, without remedy.
