### [Job Chapter 26](../../../bib/kjv/job026.htm#001.md)

[Job 26:4](../../../bib/kjv/job026.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">job 26:4</span></span>

To whom - For whose instruction hast thou uttered these things? For
mine? Dost thou think I do not know, that which the meanest persons are
not unacquainted with; that God is incomparably greater and better than
his creatures? Whose spirit - Who inspired thee with this profound
discourse of thine?

[Job 26:5](../../../bib/kjv/job026.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">job 26:5</span></span>

Dead things - Job having censured Bildad's discourse, proceeds to shew
how little he needed his information in that point. Here he shews that
the power and providences of God reaches not only to the things we see,
but also to the invisible parts of the world, not only to the heavens
above and their inhabitants, and to men upon earth, of which Bildad
discoursed, [Job 25:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/job025.htm#002.md), but also to
such persons or things as are under the earth, or under the waters;
which are out of our sight and reach; yet not out of the ken of Divine
providence. These words may be understood; either, of dead, or lifeless
things, such as amber, pearl, coral, metals, or other minerals, which
are formed or brought forth; by the almighty power of God, from under
the waters; either in the bottom of the sea, or within the earth, which
is the lowest element, and in the scripture and other authors spoken of
as under the waters; this being observed as a remarkable work of God's
providence, that the waters of the sea, which are higher than the earth,
do not overwhelm it. Or, of dead men, and of the worst of them, such as
died in their sins, and after death were condemned to farther miseries;
for of such this very word seems to be used, [Pro
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#018.md), [Pro
9:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#018.md), who are here said to mourn or
groan from under the waters; from the lower parts of the earth, or from
under those subterranean waters, which are supposed to be within and
under the earth; [Psa 33:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa033.htm#007.md), and from
under the inhabitants thereof; either of the waters or of the earth,
under which these waters are, or with the other inhabitants thereof; of
that place under the waters, namely, the apostate spirits. So the sense
is, that God's dominion is over all men, yea, even the dead, and the
worst of them, who though they would not own God, nor his providence,
while they lived, yet now are forced to acknowledge and feel that power
which they despised, and bitterly mourn under the sad effects of it in
their infernal habitations.

[Job 26:6](../../../bib/kjv/job026.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">job 26:6</span></span>

Hell - Is in his presence, and under his providence. Hell itself, that
place of utter darkness, is not hid from his sight. Destruction - The
place of destruction.

[Job 26:7](../../../bib/kjv/job026.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">job 26:7</span></span>

North - The northern part of the heavens, which is put for the whole
visible heaven, because Job and his friends lived in a northern climate.
Nothing - Upon no props or pillars, but his own power and providence.

[Job 26:9](../../../bib/kjv/job026.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">job 26:9</span></span>

Holdeth - From our view, that his glory may not dazzle our sight; he
covereth it with a cloud. Throne - The heaven of heavens, where he
dwelleth.

[Job 26:11](../../../bib/kjv/job026.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">job 26:11</span></span>

Pillars - Perhaps the mountains which by their height and strength seem
to reach and support the heavens. Astonished - When God reproveth not
them, but men by them, manifesting his displeasure by thunders, or
earthquakes.

[Job 26:14](../../../bib/kjv/job026.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">job 26:14</span></span>

Parts - But small parcels, the outside and visible work. Portion - Of
his power and wisdom, and providence. His Power - His mighty power, is
aptly compared to thunder; in regard of its irresistible force, and the
terror which it causes to wicked men.
