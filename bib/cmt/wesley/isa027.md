### [Isaiah Chapter 27](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah 27:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 27:1</span></span>

Leviathan - By this leviathan, serpent and dragon (for all signify the
same thing) be understands some powerful enemy or enemies of God, and of
his church or people, which may well be called by these names, partly
for their great might, and partly for the great terror and destruction
which they cause upon the earth. The piercing - Which by its sting
pierces deeply into mens bodies. Crooked serpent - Winding and turning
itself with great variety and dexterity. Whereby he seems to signify the
craftiness and activity of this enemy, whose strength makes it more
formidable.

[Isaiah 27:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">isa 27:2</span></span>

In that day - When this enemy shall be destroyed. A vineyard - My church
and people, of red wine, of the choicest and best wine, which in those
parts was red.

[Isaiah 27:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 27:3</span></span>

I keep it - I will protect my church from all her enemies, and supply
her with all necessary provisions.

[Isaiah 27:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 27:5</span></span>

Or - Or if at any time fury seem to be in me against my people. Let him
- My people. Take hold - Which he may by humble prayer not only restrain
from doing him hurt, but engage to do him good.

[Isaiah 27:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 27:6</span></span>

Take root - To be firmly settled in their possessions. Fruit - Their
posterity shall seek habitations in other countries, and replenish them
with people. But this seems to be understood of the spiritual seed of
Jacob.

[Isaiah 27:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">isa 27:7</span></span>

Hath he - He hath not dealt so severely with his people, as he hath
dealt with their enemies, whom he hath utterly destroyed. Of them - Of
those who were slain by God on the behalf of Israel.

[Isaiah 27:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">isa 27:8</span></span>

In measure - With moderation. When - When the vine shooteth forth its
luxuriant branches, he cuts them off, but so as not to destroy the vine.
Contend - God is said to contend with men, when he executes his
judgments upon them, [Amo 7:4](../../../bib/kjv/amo007.htm#004.md). Stayeth
- He mitigates the severity of the judgment. In the day - In the time
when he sends forth his east - wind; which he mentions because that wind
in those parts was most violent and most hurtful.

[Isaiah 27:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">isa 27:9</span></span>

By this - By this manner of God's dealing with them. When - Which sin of
Jacob's shall be purged, when he shall truly repent of all his sins, and
especially of his idolatry. Altar - Their idolatrous altars. Possibly he
may say the altar, with respect to that particular altar, which Ahaz had
set upon the place of God's own altar; and this prophecy might be
delivered in Ahaz's time, while that altar stood. Chalk - stones - When
he shall break all those goodly altars in pieces. Not stand - Shall be
thrown down with contempt.

[Isaiah 27:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">isa 27:10</span></span>

Yet - Yet before this glorious promise be fulfilled, a dreadful and
desolating judgment shall come. The city - Jerusalem and the rest of the
defenced cities in the land. The habitation - The most inhabited and
populous places. The calf - This is put for all sorts of cattle, which
may securely feed there, because there shall be no men left to disturb
them.

[Isaiah 27:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">isa 27:11</span></span>

Broken - That there may be no hopes of their recovery. Women - He
mentions women, because the men would be destroyed. Not understanding -
They know not the things which concerns their peace, but they blindly
and wilfully go on in sin. Therefore - Thus he overthrows their conceit
that God would never destroy the work of his own hands.

[Isaiah 27:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">isa 27:12</span></span>

Beat out - It is a metaphor from grain which was beaten out with a rod
or staff, and then carefully gathered and laid up. From - From Euphrates
to the Nile, which were the two borders of the land of promise. All the
Israelites who are left in the land. One by one - Which signifies, God's
exact care of them.

[Isaiah 27:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">isa 27:13</span></span>

Trumpet - God shall summon them altogether by sound of trumpet, by an
eminent call of his providence. He alludes to the custom of calling the
Israelites together with trumpets.
