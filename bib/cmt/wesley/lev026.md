### [Leviticus Chapter 26](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#001.md)

[Leviticus 26:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">lev 26:1</span></span>

An image - Or pillar, that is, to worship it, or bow down to it, as it
follows. Otherwise this was not simply prohibited, being practised by
holy men, both before and after this law.

[Leviticus 26:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">lev 26:2</span></span>

My sanctuary - By purging and preserving it from all uncleanness, by
approaching to it and managing all the services of it with reverence,
and in such manner only as God hath appointed.

[Leviticus 26:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">lev 26:4</span></span>

Rain - Therefore God placed them not in a land where there were such
rivers as the Nile, to water it and make it fruitful, but in a land
which depended wholly upon the rain of heaven, the key whereof God kept
in his own hand, that so he might the more effectually oblige them to
obedience, in which their happiness consisted.

[Leviticus 26:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">lev 26:5</span></span>

The vintage - That is, you shall have so plentiful an harvest, that you
shall not be able to thresh out your corn in a little time, but that
work will last till the vintage.

[Leviticus 26:6](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">lev 26:6</span></span>

The sword - That is, war, as the sword is oft taken. It shall not enter
into it, nor have passage through it, much less shall your land be made
the seat of war.

[Leviticus 26:8](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">lev 26:8</span></span>

Five - A small number; a certain number for an uncertain.

[Leviticus 26:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">lev 26:9</span></span>

Establish my covenant - That is, actually perform all that I have
promised in my covenant made with you.

[Leviticus 26:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">lev 26:10</span></span>

Bring forth - Or, cast out, throw them away as having no occasion to
spend them, or give them to the poor, or even to your cattle, that you
may make way for the new corn, which also is so plentiful, that of
itself it will fill up your barns.

[Leviticus 26:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">lev 26:11</span></span>

I will set - As I have placed it, so I will continue it among you, and
not remove it from you, as once I did upon your miscarriage, [Exo
33:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#007.md).

[Leviticus 26:12](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">lev 26:12</span></span>

I will walk among you - As I have hitherto done, both by my pillar of
cloud and fire, and by my tabernacle, which have walked or gone along
with you in all your journeys, and staid among you in all your stations,
to protect, conduct, instruct, and comfort you. And I will own you for
that peculiar people which I have singled out of mankind, to bless you
here and to save you hereafter.

[Leviticus 26:13](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">lev 26:13</span></span>

Upright - With heads lifted up, not pressed down with a yoke. It notes
their liberty, security, confidence and glory.

[Leviticus 26:15](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">lev 26:15</span></span>

Break my covenant - Break your part of that covenant made between me and
you, and thereby discharge me from the blessings promised on my part.

[Leviticus 26:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">lev 26:16</span></span>

That shall consume the eyes, and cause sorrow of heart - Two remarkable
effects of this distemper, when it continues long. It eminently weakens
the sight, and sinks the spirit. All chronical diseases are here
included in the consumption, all acute in the burning ague or fever.

[Leviticus 26:19](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">lev 26:19</span></span>

The pride of your power - That is, your strength of which you are proud,
your numerous and united forces, your kingdom, yea, your ark and
sanctuary. I will make your heaven as iron - The heavens shall yield you
no rain, nor the earth fruits.

[Leviticus 26:20](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">lev 26:20</span></span>

In vain - in plowing, and sowing, and tilling the ground.

[Leviticus 26:25](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">lev 26:25</span></span>

The quarrel of my covenant - That is, my quarrel with you for your
breach of your covenant made with me.

[Leviticus 26:26](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">lev 26:26</span></span>

When I have broken the staff of your bread - By sending a famine or
scarcity of bread, which is the staff and support of man's present life.
Ten women - That is, ten or many families, for the women took care for
the bread and food of all the family. By weight - This is a sign and
consequence both of a famine, and of the baking of the bread of several
families together in one oven, wherein each family took care to weigh
their bread, and to receive the same proportion which they put in.

[Leviticus 26:29](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">lev 26:29</span></span>

The flesh of your sons - Through extreme hunger. See [Lam
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#010.md).

[Leviticus 26:30](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">lev 26:30</span></span>

High places - In which you will sacrifice after the manner of the
Heathens. The carcases of your idols - So he calls them, either to
signify that their idols how specious soever or glorious in their eyes,
were in truth but lifeless and contemptible carcases; or to shew that
their idols should be so far from helping them, that they should be
thrown down and broken with them, and both should lie together in a
forlorn and loathsome state.

[Leviticus 26:31](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">lev 26:31</span></span>

Sanctuaries - God's sanctuary, called sanctuaries here, as also [Psa
73:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#017.md), [Psa
74:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#007.md); [Jer
51:51](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#051.md); [Eze
28:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#018.md), because there were divers
apartments in it, each of which was a sanctuary, or, which is all one,
an holy place, as they are severally called. And yours emphatically, not
mine, for I disown and abhor it, and all the services you do in it,
because you have defiled it. I will not smell - Not own or accept them.
Your sweet odours - Either of the incense, or of your sacrifices, which
when offered with faith and obedience, are sweet and acceptable to me.

[Leviticus 26:32](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">lev 26:32</span></span>

Who dwell therein - Having driven you out and possessed your places.

[Leviticus 26:33](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">lev 26:33</span></span>

After you - The sword shall follow you into strange lands, and you shall
have no rest there.

[Leviticus 26:34](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">lev 26:34</span></span>

The land shall enjoy her sabbaths - It shall enjoy those sabbatical
years of rest from tillage, which you through covetousness would not
give it.

[Leviticus 26:37](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">lev 26:37</span></span>

When none pursueth - Your guilt and fear causing you to imagine that
they do pursue when indeed they do not.

[Leviticus 26:39](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#039.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">lev 26:39</span></span>

Pine away - Be consumed and melt away by degrees through diseases,
oppressions, griefs, and manifold miseries.

[Leviticus 26:40](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#040.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">lev 26:40</span></span>

If they shall confess their iniquity, and the iniquity of their fathers,
with their trespass which they have trespassed against me - That is,
with their prevarication with me and defection from me to idolatry,
which by way of eminency he calls their trespass: and that also they
have walked contrary to me, [Lev
26:41](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#041.md), and that I also have walked
contrary unto them, and have brought them into the land of their enemies
- That is, that they are not come into these calamities by chance, nor
by the misfortune of war, but by my just judgment upon them. And, if
then their uncircumcised, that is, impure, carnal, profane, and
impenitent hearts be humbled, that is, subdued, purged, reformed: if to
this confession they add sincere humiliation and reformation, I will do
what follows.

[Leviticus 26:41](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#041.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">lev 26:41</span></span>

If they accept of - The meaning is, if they sincerely acknowledge the
righteousness of God and their own wickedness, and patiently submit to
his correcting hand; if with David they are ready to say, it is good for
them that they are afflicted, that they may learn God's statutes, and
yield obedience to them for the future, which is a good evidence of true
repentance.

[Leviticus 26:42](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#042.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">lev 26:42</span></span>

I will remember my covenant - So as to make good all that I have
promised in it. For words of knowledge or remembrance in scripture,
commonly denote affection and kindness. I will remember the land - Which
now seems to be forgotten and despised, as if I had never chosen it to
be the peculiar place of my presence and blessing.

[Leviticus 26:44](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#044.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_044">lev 26:44</span></span>

For I am the Lord their God - Therefore neither the desperateness of
their condition, nor the greatness of their sins, shall make me wholly
make void my covenant with them and their ancestors, but I will in due
time remember them for good, and for my covenant's sake return to them
in mercy. From this place the Jews take great comfort, and assure
themselves of deliverance out of their present servitude and misery. And
from this, and such other places, St. Paul concludes, that the
Israelitish nation, tho' then rejected and ruined, should be gathered
again and restored.

[Leviticus 26:46](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#046.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_046">lev 26:46</span></span>

These are the laws which the Lord made between him and the children of
Israel - Hereby his communion with his church is kept up. He manifests
not only his dominion over them, but his favour to them, by giving them
his law. And they manifest not only their holy fear, but their holy love
by the observance of it. And thus it is made between them rather as a
covenant than as a law: for he draws them with the cords of a man.
