### [Matthew Chapter 8](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#001.md)

[Matthew 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">mat 8:2</span></span>

A leper came - Leprosies in those countries were seldom curable by
natural means, any more than palsies or lunacy. Probably this leper,
though he might not mix with the people, had heard our Lord at a
distance. [Mar 1:40](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#040.md); [Luk
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#012.md).

[Matthew 8:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">mat 8:4</span></span>

See thou tell no man - Perhaps our Lord only meant here, Not till thou
hast showed thyself to the priest - who was appointed to inquire into
the case of leprosy. But many others he commanded, absolutely, to tell
none of tho miracles he had wrought upon them. And this he seems to have
done, chiefly for one or more of these reasons: To prevent the multitude
from thronging him, in the manner related [Mar
1:45](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#045.md). To fulfil the prophecy, [Isa
42:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#001.md), that he would not be vain or
ostentatious. This reason St. Matthew assigns, [Mat
12:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#017.md), &c. To avoid the being taken by
force and made a king, [Joh 6:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#015.md). And,
That he might not enrage the chief priests, scribes, and Pharisees, who
were the most bitter against him, any more than was unavoidable, [Mat
16:20-21](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#020.md).

For a testimony - That I am the Messiah; to them - The priests, who
otherwise might have pleaded want of evidence. [Lev
14:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev014.htm#002.md).

[Matthew 8:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">mat 8:5</span></span>

There came to him a centurion - A captain of a hundred Roman soldiers.
Probably he came a little way toward him, and then went back. He thought
himself not worthy to come in person, and therefore spoke the words that
follow by his messengers. As it is not unusual in all languages, so in
the Hebrew it is peculiarly frequent, to ascribe to a person himself the
thing which is done, and the words which are spoken by his order. And
accordingly St. Matthew relates as said by the centurion himself, what
others said by order from him. An instance of the same kind we have in
the case of Zebedee's children. From St. Matthew, [Mat
20:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#020.md), we learn it was their mother
that spoke those words, which, [Mar
10:35](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#035.md), [Mar
10:37](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#037.md), themselves are said to speak;
because she was only their mouth. Yet from [Mat
8:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#013.md), Go thy way home, it appears he
at length came in person, probably on hearing that Jesus was nearer to
his house than he apprehended when he sent the second message by his
friends. [Luk 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#001.md).

[Matthew 8:8](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">mat 8:8</span></span>

The centurion answered - By his second messengers.

[Matthew 8:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">mat 8:9</span></span>

For I am a man under authority - I am only an inferior officer: and what
I command, is done even in my absence: how much more what thou
commandest, who art Lord of all!

[Matthew 8:10](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">mat 8:10</span></span>

I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel - For the centurion
was not an Israelite.

[Matthew 8:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">mat 8:11</span></span>

Many from the farthest parts of the earth shall embrace the terms and
enjoy the rewards of the Gospel covenant established with Abraham. But
the Jews, who have the first title to them, shall be shut out from the
feast; from grace here, and hereafter from glory. [Luk
13:29](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#029.md).

[Matthew 8:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">mat 8:12</span></span>

The outer darkness - Our Lord here alludes to the custom the ancients
had of making their feast in the night time. Probably while he was
speaking this, the centurion came in person. [Mat
13:42](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#042.md), [Mat
13:50](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#050.md); [Mat
22:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#013.md); [Mat
24:51](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#051.md); [Mat
25:30](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#030.md).

[Matthew 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">mat 8:14</span></span>

Peter's wife's mother - St. Peter was then a young man, as were all the
apostles. [Mar 1:29](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#029.md); [Luk
4:38](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#038.md).

[Matthew 8:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">mat 8:16</span></span>

[Mar 1:32](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#032.md); [Luk
4:40](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#040.md).

[Matthew 8:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">mat 8:17</span></span>

Whereby was fulfilled what was spoken by the Prophet Isaiah - He spoke
it in a more exalted sense. The evangelist here only alludes to those
words, as being capable of this lower meaning also. Such instances are
frequent in the sacred writings, and are elegancies rather than
imperfections. He fulfilled these words in the highest sense, by bearing
our sins in his own body on the tree: in a lower sense, by sympathizing
with us in our sorrows, and healing us of the diseases which were the
fruit of sin. [Isa 53:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#004.md).

[Matthew 8:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">mat 8:18</span></span>

He commanded to go to the other side - That both himself and the people
might have a little rest.

[Matthew 8:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">mat 8:19</span></span>

[Luk 9:57](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#057.md).

[Matthew 8:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">mat 8:20</span></span>

The Son of man - The expression is borrowed from [Dan
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#013.md), and is the appellation which
Christ generally gives himself: which he seems to do out of humility, as
having some relation to his mean appearance in this world. Hath not
where to lay his head - Therefore do not follow me from any view of
temporal advantage.

[Matthew 8:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">mat 8:21</span></span>

Another said - I will follow thee without any such view; but I must mind
my business first. It is not certain that his father was already dead.
Perhaps his son desired to stay with him, being very old, till his
death.

[Matthew 8:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">mat 8:22</span></span>

But Jesus said - When God calls, leave the business of the world to them
who are dead to God.

[Matthew 8:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">mat 8:23</span></span>

[Mar 4:35](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#035.md); [Luk
8:22](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#022.md).

[Matthew 8:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">mat 8:24</span></span>

The ship was covered - So man's extremity is God's opportunity.

[Matthew 8:26](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">mat 8:26</span></span>

Why are ye fearful - Then he rebuked the winds - First, he composed
their spirits, and then the sea.

[Matthew 8:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">mat 8:28</span></span>

The country of the Gergesenes - Or of the Gadarenes - Gergesa and Gadara
were towns near each other. Hence the country between them took its
name, sometimes from the one, sometimes from the other. There met him
two demoniacs - St. Mark and St. Luke mention only one, who was probably
the fiercer of the two, and the person who spoke to our Lord first. But
this is no way inconsistent with the account which St. Matthew gives.
The tombs - Doubtless those malevolent spirits love such tokens of death
and destruction. Tombs were usually in those days in desert places, at a
distance from towns, and were often made in the sides of caves, in the
rocks and mountains. No one could pass - Safely. [Mar
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#001.md); [Luk
8:26](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#026.md).

[Matthew 8:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">mat 8:29</span></span>

What have we to do with thee - This is a Hebrew phrase, which signifies.
Why do you concern yourself about us? [Sa2
16:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa2016.htm#010.md). Before the time - The great
day.

[Matthew 8:30](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">mat 8:30</span></span>

There was a herd of many swine - Which it was not lawful for the Jews to
keep. Therefore our Lord both justly and mercifully permitted them to be
destroyed.

[Matthew 8:31](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">mat 8:31</span></span>

He said, Go - A word of permission only, not command.

[Matthew 8:34](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">mat 8:34</span></span>

They besought him to depart out of their coasts - They loved their swine
so much better than their souls! How many are of the same mind!
