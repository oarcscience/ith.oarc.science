### [Exodus Chapter 8](../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#001)

[Exodus 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">exo 8:2</span></span>

All thy borders - All the land that is within thy borders.

[Exodus 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">exo 8:3</span></span>

The River - Nile. Under which are comprehended all other rivers and
waters.

[Exodus 8:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">exo 8:9</span></span>

Glory over me - That is, I yield to thee.

[Exodus 8:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">exo 8:10</span></span>

And he said, To - morrow - Why not immediately? Probably he hoped that
this night they would go away of themselves, and then he should get
clear of the plague, without being obliged either to God or Moses.
However, Moses joins issue with him upon it. Be it according to thy word
- It shall be done just when thou wouldst have it done, that thou mayst
know, that whatever the magicians pretend to, there is none like unto
the Lord our God - None has such a command as he has over all creatures,
nor is any so ready to forgive those that humble themselves before him.
The great design both of judgments and mercies, is to convince us that
there is none like the Lord our God; none so wise, so mighty, so good;
no enemy so formidable, no friend so desirable, so valuable.

[Exodus 8:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">exo 8:15</span></span>

But when Pharaoh saw that there was respite, he hardened his heart -
Observe he did it himself, not God, any otherwise than by not hindering.

[Exodus 8:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">exo 8:17</span></span>

The frogs were produced out of the waters, but the lice out of the dust
of the earth; for out of any part of the creation God can fetch a
scourge wherewith to correct those that rebel against him.

[Exodus 8:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">exo 8:18</span></span>

And the magicians did so - That is, endeavoured to do so.

[Exodus 8:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">exo 8:19</span></span>

This is the finger of God - The power of God. The devil's agents, when
God permitted them, could do great things; but when he laid an embargo
upon them, they could do nothing. The magicians inability in this
instance shewed whence they had their ability in the former instances,
and that they had no power against Moses but what was given them from
above. But Pharaoh's heart was hardened - By himself and the devil.

[Exodus 8:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">exo 8:20</span></span>

Rise up early - Those that would bring great things to pass for God and
their generation must rise early, and redeem time in the morning.
Pharaoh was early up at his superstitious devotions to the river; and
shall we be for more sleep, and more slumber, when any service is to be
done which would pass well in our account in the great day?

[Exodus 8:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">exo 8:21</span></span>

Flies - Or insects of various kinds; not only flies, but gnats, wasps,
hornets; and those probably more pernicious than the common ones were.

[Exodus 8:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">exo 8:22</span></span>

Know that I am the Lord in the midst of the earth - In every part of it.
Swarms of flies, which seem to us to fly at random, shall be manifestly
under the conduct of an intelligent mind. Hither they shall go, saith
Moses, and thither they shall come, and the performance is punctual
according to this appointment; and both compared amount to a
demonstration, that he that said it, and he that did it, was the same,
even a being of infinite power and wisdom.

[Exodus 8:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">exo 8:23</span></span>

A division - A wall of partition.

[Exodus 8:24](../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">exo 8:24</span></span>

There came a grievous swarm of flies - The prince of the power of the
air has gloried in being Beel - zebub, the god of flies; but here it is
proved that even in that he is a pretender, and an usurper; for even
with swarms of flies God fights against his kingdom and prevails.

[Exodus 8:26](../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">exo 8:26</span></span>

The abomination of the Egyptians - That which they abominate to see
killed, because they worshipped them as gods.

[Exodus 8:27](../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">exo 8:27</span></span>

As he shall command us - For he has not yet told us what sacrifices to
offer.

[Exodus 8:28](../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">exo 8:28</span></span>

Ye shall not go very far away - Not so far but that he might fetch them
back again. It is likely he suspected that if once they left Egypt, they
would never come back; and therefore when he is forced to consent that
they shall go, yet he is not willing they should go out of his reach.
See how ready God is to accept sinners submissions. Pharaoh only says,
Intreat for me - Moses promises immediately, I will intreat the Lord for
thee; and that he might see what the design of the plague was, not to
bring him to ruin, but to repentance.

[Exodus 8:32](../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">exo 8:32</span></span>

But Pharaoh hardened his heart at this time also - Still it is his own
act and deed, not God's.
