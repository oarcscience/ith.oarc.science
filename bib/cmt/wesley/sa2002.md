### [2 Kings (2 Samuel) Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#001.md)

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa2 2:1</span></span>

Enquired - By Urim. Thus David begins at the right end, and lays his
foundation in God's counsel and assistance. Shall I go - He asked not
whether he should take the kingdom; for that was appointed before; and
he would not offend God, nor dishonour his ordinance with unnecessary
enquiries; but only where he should enter upon it; whether in Judah, as
he supposed, because of his relation to that tribe, and his interest in
it; or in some other tribe: for he doth not limit God, but resolves
exactly to follow his counsels. Hebron - Which was next to Jerusalem
(part whereof the Jebusites now possessed) the chief city of that tribe,
and a city of the priests, and in the very center of that tribe, to
which the whole tribe might speedily resort, when need required. And the
sepulchres of the patriarchs adjoining to Hebron, would remind him of
the ancient promise.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">sa2 2:3</span></span>

Dwelt in - That is, the cities or towns belonging to Hebron, which was
the Metropolis. For in Hebron itself there was not space for them all,
because it was filled with priests, and with David's court.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">sa2 2:4</span></span>

Anointed - This they did upon just grounds, because not only the kingdom
was promised to that tribe, but David was designed and anointed by God,
whose will both they and all Israel were obliged to obey. And they
resolved not to neglect their duty, though they saw the other tribes
would. Yet their modesty is observable, they make him king of Judah
only, and not of all Israel. And therefore there was need of a third
anointing to the kingdom over all Israel, which he had [Sa2
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#003.md), that first anointing; [Sa1
16:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#013.md), was only a designation of the
person who should be king, but not an actual inauguration of him to the
kingdom.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">sa2 2:5</span></span>

Kindness - This respect and affection. For as it is, an act of
inhumanity to deny burial to the dead; so it is an act of mercy and
kindness to bury them.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">sa2 2:6</span></span>

Kindness and truth - That is, true and real kindness; not in words only,
but also in actions, as you have done to your king. I will requite - So
far am I from being offended with you for this kindness to my late
enemy.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">sa2 2:7</span></span>

Be valiant - Be not afraid lest the Philistines should punish you for
this fact, but take good courage, I will defend you. For, &c. - Or,
though your master Saul be dead, and so your hearts may faint, as if you
were now sheep without a shepherd.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">sa2 2:8</span></span>

Abner - Tho' ambition and desire of rule, because he knew that
Ishbosheth would have only the name of king, whilst he had the power.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">sa2 2:9</span></span>

Gilead - Largely so taken, for all the land of Israel beyond Jordan.
Ashurites - That is, the tribe of Asher, as the Chaldee paraphrast and
others understand it. Jezreel - A large and rich valley situate in the
borders of the tribes of Zebulun, Issachar and Naphtali, and so put for
them all. All Israel - Except Judah.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">sa2 2:10</span></span>

Two years - Namely, before the following war broke out, which continued
five years.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">sa2 2:12</span></span>

Went out - To fight with David's army, and to bring back the rest of the
kingdom to Saul's house.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">sa2 2:13</span></span>

Met - That is, met the opposite army, and put themselves in a posture
for battle.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">sa2 2:14</span></span>

And play - That is, shew their prowess and dexterity in fighting
together. He speaks like a vain - glorious and cruel man, and a soldier
of fortune, that esteemed it a sport to see men wounding and killing one
another. So this he designed, partly for their mutual recreation and
trial of skill; and partly, that by this occasion they might be engaged
in a battle. But he is unworthy the name of a man, who is thus prodigal
of human blood.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">sa2 2:16</span></span>

By the head - By the hair of the head, which after their manner was of a
considerable length. Helkath - kazzurim - Or, the field of rock; that
is, of men who stood like rocks unmovable, each one dying upon the spot
where he fought.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 2:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">sa2 2:21</span></span>

And take, &c. - If thou art ambitious to get a trophy or mark of thy
valour, desist from me who am an old and experienced captain, and go to
some young and raw soldier; try thy skill upon him, and take away his
arms from him.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">sa2 2:23</span></span>

And died - So Asahel's swiftness, which he presumed on so much, only
forwarded his fate! With it he ran upon his death, instead of running
from it.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 2:26](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">sa2 2:26</span></span>

Bitterness - It will produce dreadful effects. Brethren - By nation and
religion: whom therefore they should not pursue with so fierce a rage,
as if they were pursuing the Philistines.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 2:27](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">sa2 2:27</span></span>

Unless, &c. - Unless thou hadst made the motion that they should fight,
[Sa2 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#014.md). It was thou, not I, that
gave the first occasion of this fight. Abner was the sole cause of this
war; otherwise all things had been ended by an amicable agreement: which
might have been made that very morning, if he had so pleased.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 2:32](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">sa2 2:32</span></span>

In Bethlehem - The rest they buried in the field of battle, but Asahel
in the sepulchre of his father. Thus are distinctions made upon earth,
even between the dust of some and of others! But in the resurrection no
difference will be made but between good and bad; which will remain for
ever.
