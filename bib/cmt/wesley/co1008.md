### [1 Corinthians Chapter 8](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#001)

[1 Corinthians 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">co1 8:1</span></span>

Now concerning the next question you proposed. All of us have knowledge
- A gentle reproof of their self - conceit. Knowledge without love
always puffeth up. Love alone edifies - Builds us up in holiness.

[1 Corinthians 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">co1 8:2</span></span>

If any man think he knoweth any thing - Aright, unless so far he is
taught by God. He knoweth nothing yet as he ought to know - Seeing there
is no true knowledge without divine love.

[1 Corinthians 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">co1 8:3</span></span>

He is known - That is, approved, by him. [Psa
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#006).

[1 Corinthians 8:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">co1 8:4</span></span>

We know that an idol is nothing - A mere nominal god, having no
divinity, virtue, or power.

[1 Corinthians 8:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">co1 8:5</span></span>

For though there be that are called gods - By the heathens both
celestial, (as they style them,) terrestrial, and infernal deities.

[1 Corinthians 8:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">co1 8:6</span></span>

Yet to us - Christians. There is but one God - This is exclusive, not of
the One Lord, as if he were an inferior deity; but only of the idols to
which the One God is opposed. From whom are all things - By creation,
providence, and grace. And we for him - The end of all we are, have, and
do. And one Lord - Equally the object of divine worship. By whom are all
things - Created, sustained, and governed. And we by him - Have access
to the Father, and all spiritual blessings.

[1 Corinthians 8:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">co1 8:7</span></span>

Some eat, with consciousness of the idol - That is, fancying it is
something, and that it makes the meat unlawful to be eaten. And their
conscience, being weak - Not rightly informed. Is defiled - contracts
guilt by doing it.

[1 Corinthians 8:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">co1 8:8</span></span>

But meat commendeth us not to God - Neither by eating, nor by refraining
from it. Eating and not eating are in themselves things merely
indifferent.

[1 Corinthians 8:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">co1 8:10</span></span>

For if any one see thee who hast knowledge - Whom he believes to have
more knowledge than himself, and who really hast this knowledge, that an
idol is nothing - sitting down to an entertainment in an idol temple.
The heathens frequently made entertainments in their temples, on what
hath been sacrificed to their idols. Will not the conscience of him that
is weak - Scrupulous. Be encouraged - By thy example. To eat - Though
with a doubting conscience.

[1 Corinthians 8:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">co1 8:11</span></span>

And through thy knowledge shall the weak brother perish, for whom Christ
died? - And for whom thou wilt not lose a meal's meat, so far from dying
for him! We see, Christ died even for them that perish.

[1 Corinthians 8:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">co1 8:12</span></span>

Ye sin against Christ - Whose members they are.

[1 Corinthians 8:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">co1 8:13</span></span>

If meat - Of any kind. Who will follow this example? What preacher or
private Christian will abstain from any thing lawful in itself, when it
offends a weak brother?
