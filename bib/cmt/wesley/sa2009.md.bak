### [2 Kings (2 Samuel) Chapter 9](../../../bib/kjv/sa2009.htm#001.md)

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2009.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa2 9:1</span></span>

Of Saul - He saith not of the house of Jonathan, for he knew not of any
son he had left, and therefore thought his kindness and obligation was
to pass to the next of his kindred. As for Mephibosheth, he was very
young and obscure, and possibly concealed by his friends, lest David
should cut him off, as hath been usual among princes.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 9:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa2009.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">sa2 9:5</span></span>

Machir - This Machir appears to have been a generous man, who
entertained Mephibosheth out of mere compassion, not of disaffection to
David: for afterwards we find him kind to David himself, when he fled
from Absalom. David now little thought, that the time would come, when
he himself should need his assistance. Let us be forward to give,
because we know not what we ourselves may sometime want.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 9:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2009.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">sa2 9:8</span></span>

Bowed himself - It is good to have the heart humbled under humbling
providences. If when divine providence brings our condition down, divine
grace brings our spirits down, we shall be easy.
