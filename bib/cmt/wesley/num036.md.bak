### [Numbers Chapter 36](../../../bib/kjv/num036.htm#001.md)

[Numbers 36:2](../../../bib/kjv/num036.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">num 36:2</span></span>

Our brother - Our kinsman.

[Numbers 36:6](../../../bib/kjv/num036.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">num 36:6</span></span>

To the family - They seem hereby to he confined not only to the same
tribe, but also to the family of their tribe, as appears from the reason
of the law, for God would have the inheritance of families as well as
tribes kept entire and unmixed.

[Numbers 36:8](../../../bib/kjv/num036.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">num 36:8</span></span>

The inheritance of his fathers - This law was not general to forbid
every woman to marry into another tribe, as may be reasonably concluded
from the practice of so many patriarchs, kings, priests, and other holy
men, who have married women of other tribes, yea sometimes of other
nations, but restrained to heiresses, or such as were likely to be so.
But if they had brethren, they were free to marry into any tribe, yet so
that, if their brethren died, the inheritance went from them to the next
a - kin of their father's tribe and family. And the principal reason why
God was solicitous to preserve tribes and families unmixed was, that the
tribe and family too, out of which the Messiah was to come, and by which
he should be known, might be evident and unquestionable.
