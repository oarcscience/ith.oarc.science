### [Romans Chapter 11](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#001.md)

[Romans 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">rom 11:1</span></span>

Hath God rejected his whole people - All Israel? In no wise. Now there
is "a remnant" who believe, [Rom 11:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#005.md);
and hereafter "all Israel will be saved," [Rom
11:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#026.md).

[Romans 11:2](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">rom 11:2</span></span>

God hath not rejected that part of his people whom he foreknew -
Speaking after the manner of men. For, in fact, knowing and foreknowing
are the same thing with God, who knows or sees all things at once, from
everlasting to everlasting. Know ye not - That in a parallel case,
amidst a general apostasy, when Elijah thought the whole nation was
fallen into idolatry, God "knew" there was "a remnant" of true
worshippers.

[Romans 11:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">rom 11:3</span></span>

[Kg1 19:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#010.md).

[Romans 11:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">rom 11:4</span></span>

To Baal - Nor to the golden calves.

[Romans 11:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">rom 11:5</span></span>

According to the election of grace - According to that gracious purpose
of God, "He that believeth shall be saved."

[Romans 11:6](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">rom 11:6</span></span>

And if by grace, then it is no more of works - Whether ceremonial or
moral. Else grace is no longer grace - The very nature of grace is lost.
And if it be of works, then it is no more grace: else work is no longer
work - But the very nature of it is destroyed. There is something so
absolutely inconsistent between the being justified by grace, and the
being justified by works, that, if you suppose either, you of necessity
exclude the other. For what is given to works is the payment of a debt;
whereas grace implies an unmerited favour. So that the same benefit
cannot, in the very nature of things, be derived from both.

[Romans 11:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">rom 11:7</span></span>

What then - What is the conclusion from the whole? It is this: that
Israel in general hath not obtained justification; but those of them
only who believe. And the rest were blinded - By their own wilful
prejudice.

[Romans 11:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">rom 11:8</span></span>

God hath at length withdrawn his Spirit, and so given them up to a
spirit of slumber; which is fulfilled unto this day. [Isa
29:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#010.md)

[Romans 11:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">rom 11:9</span></span>

And David saith - In that prophetic imprecation, which is applicable to
them, as well as to Judas. A recompence - Of their preceding wickedness.
So sin is punished by sin; and thus the gospel, which should have fed
and strengthened their souls, is become a means of destroying them. [Psa
69:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#022.md)

[Romans 11:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">rom 11:11</span></span>

Have they stumbled so as to fall - Totally and finally? No But by their
fall - Or slip: it is a very soft word in the original. Salvation is
come to the gentiles - See an instance of this, [Act
13:46](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#046.md). To provoke them - The Jews
themselves, to jealousy.

[Romans 11:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">rom 11:12</span></span>

The first part of this verse is treated of, [Rom
11:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#013.md), &c; the latter, How much more
their fulness, (that is, their full conversion,) [Rom
11:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#023.md), &c.

So many prophecies refer to this grand event, that it is surprising any
Christian can doubt of it. And these are greatly confirmed by the
wonderful preservation of the Jews as a distinct people to this day.
When it is accomplished, it will be so strong a demonstration, both of
the Old and New Testament revelation, as will doubtless convince many
thousand Deists, in countries nominally Christian; of whom there will,
of course, be increasing multitudes among merely nominal Christians. And
this will be a means of swiftly propagating the gospel among Mahometans
and Pagans; who would probably have received it long ago, had they
conversed only with real Christians.

[Romans 11:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">rom 11:13</span></span>

I magnify my office - Far from being ashamed of ministering to the
gentiles, I glory therein; the rather, as it may be a means of provoking
my brethren to jealousy.

[Romans 11:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">rom 11:14</span></span>

My flesh - My kinsmen.

[Romans 11:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">rom 11:15</span></span>

Life from the dead - Overflowing life to the world, which was dead.

[Romans 11:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">rom 11:16</span></span>

And this will surely come to pass. For if the first fruits be holy, so
is the lump - The consecration of them was esteemed the consecration of
all and so the conversion of a few Jews is an earnest of the conversion
of all the rest. And if the root be holy - The patriarchs from whom they
spring, surely God will at length make their descendants also holy.

[Romans 11:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">rom 11:17</span></span>

Thou - O gentile. Being a wild olive tree - Had the graft been nobler
than the stock, yet its dependance on it for life and nourishment would
leave it no room to boast against it. How much less, when, contrary to
what is practised among men, the wild olive tree is engrafted on the
good!

[Romans 11:18](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">rom 11:18</span></span>

Boast not against the branches - Do not they do this who despise the
Jews? or deny their future conversion?

[Romans 11:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">rom 11:20</span></span>

They were broken off for unbelief, and thou standest by faith - Both
conditionally, not absolutely: if absolutely, there might have been room
to boast. By faith - The free gift of God, which therefore ought to
humble thee.

[Romans 11:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">rom 11:21</span></span>

Be not highminded, but fear - We may observe, this fear is not opposed
to trust, but to pride and security.

[Romans 11:22](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">rom 11:22</span></span>

Else shalt thou - Also, who now "standest by faith," be both totally and
finally cut off.

[Romans 11:24](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">rom 11:24</span></span>

Contrary to nature - For according to nature, we graft the fruitful
branch into the wild stock; but here the wild branch is grafted into the
fruitful stock.

[Romans 11:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">rom 11:25</span></span>

St. Paul calls any truth known but to a few, a mystery. Such had been
the calling of the gentiles: such was now the conversion of the Jews.
Lest ye should be wise in your own conceits - Puffed up with your
present advantages; dreaming that ye are the only church; or that the
church of Rome cannot fail. Hardness in part is happened to Israel, till
- Israel therefore is neither totally nor finally rejected. The fullness
of the gentiles be come in - Till there be a vast harvest amongst the
heathens.

[Romans 11:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">rom 11:26</span></span>

And so all Israel shall be saved - Being convinced by the coming of the
gentiles. But there will be a still larger harvest among the gentiles,
when all Israel is come in. The deliverer shall come - Yea, the
deliverer is come; but not the full fruit of his coming. [Isa
59:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#020.md)

[Romans 11:28](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">rom 11:28</span></span>

They are now enemies - To the gospel, to God, and to themselves, which
God permits. For your sake: but as for the election - That part of them
who believe, they are beloved.

[Romans 11:29](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">rom 11:29</span></span>

For the gifts and the calling of God are without repentance - God does
not repent of his gifts to the Jews, or his calling of the gentiles.

[Romans 11:32](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">rom 11:32</span></span>

For God hath shut up all together in disobedience - Suffering each in
their turn to revolt from him. First, God suffered the gentiles in the
early age to revolt, and took the family of Abraham as a peculiar seed
to himself. Afterwards he permitted them to fall through unbelief, and
took in the believing gentiles. And he did even this to provoke the Jews
to jealousy, and so bring them also in the end to faith. This was truly
a mystery in the divine conduct, which the apostle adores with such holy
astonishment.

[Romans 11:33](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">rom 11:33</span></span>

O the depth of the riches, and wisdom, and knowledge of God - In the
ninth chapter, St. Paul had sailed but in a narrow sea: now he is in the
ocean. The depth of the riches is described, [Rom
11:35](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#035.md); the depth of wisdom, [Rom
11:34](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#034.md); the depth of knowledge, in the
latter part of this verse. Wisdom directs all things to the best end;
knowledge sees that end. How unsearchable are his judgments - With
regard to unbelievers. His ways - With regard to believers. His ways are
more upon a level; His judgments "a great deep." But even his ways we
cannot trace.

[Romans 11:34](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">rom 11:34</span></span>

Who hath known the mind of the Lord - Before or any farther than he has
revealed it. [Isa 40:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#013.md).

[Romans 11:35](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">rom 11:35</span></span>

Given to him - Either wisdom or power?

[Romans 11:36](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">rom 11:36</span></span>

Of him - As the Creator. Through him - As the Preserver. To him - As the
ultimate end, are all things. To him be the glory of his riches, wisdom,
knowledge. Amen - A concluding word, in which the affection of the
apostle, when it is come to the height, shuts up all.
