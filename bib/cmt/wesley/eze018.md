### [Ezekiel Chapter 18](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#001)

[Ezekiel 18:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">eze 18:2</span></span>

The land of Israel - The two tribes, not the ten. The fathers - Our fore
- fathers. Have eaten - Have sinned. The childrens - We their children,
who were unborn, suffer for their sins.

[Ezekiel 18:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">eze 18:4</span></span>

Behold - There can be no colour of partial judgment in the proceedings
of God, who is equally God to all. All souls - All persons. The soul -
The person, whether father or son, shall die, shall bear his own
punishment.

[Ezekiel 18:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">eze 18:6</span></span>

Hath not eaten - Hath not committed idolatry, offering sacrifice, and
eating of the things sacrificed to idols; whose temples and altars were
on mountains, chap. 20. & 28. [Hos
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#013).

[Ezekiel 18:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">eze 18:8</span></span>

Increase - Illegal interest. Iniquity - Injustice of every kind.

[Ezekiel 18:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">eze 18:9</span></span>

Shall live - Shall be delivered from famine, pestilence, and sword, and
shall see good days.

[Ezekiel 18:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">eze 18:13</span></span>

His blood - Heb. 'Tis plural, bloods; both the blood of the innocent
which he murdered, and his own blood which thereby he forfeited; the
blood of his own soul and life: that is the whole blame of his misery in
time and eternity, shall lie upon himself.

[Ezekiel 18:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">eze 18:17</span></span>

Hath taken off - Withdrawn his hand from hurting or wronging the poor,
tho' he had power to do it securely.

[Ezekiel 18:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">eze 18:20</span></span>

Shall not bear - This is a most unquestionable truth; and tho' perhaps
it may seem otherwise in some cases, yet could we see perfectly the
connexion between persons and persons; could we see the connexion of
sins and sins, and how easily, secretly, and undiscerned men become
guilty of the same sins, we should see father and son, though perhaps
one of them might not do the evil, both guilty, and neither punished for
the sin farther than if it was his own: nor do the scriptures, [Exo
20:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#005); [Deu
28:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#018), doom persons to punishment for
sins from which they are wholly free; but if children shall follow their
fathers in sin, then if they die for those sins, 'tis because these are
their own, not as they are their fathers. The righteousness - It shall
be well with the righteous, for he shall eat the fruit of his doing, he
shall be rewarded as a righteous one. The wickedness - The reward of
wickedness. "The son shall not die, not die eternally, for the iniquity
of the father, if he do not tread in the steps of it: nor the father for
the iniquity of the son, if he do all he can to prevent it.

[Ezekiel 18:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">eze 18:22</span></span>

Not mentioned - Not to him.

[Ezekiel 18:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">eze 18:25</span></span>

The way - His whole management of affairs. Not equal - Not right, or
consistent with his own declaration, and law.

[Ezekiel 18:28](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">eze 18:28</span></span>

He shall surely live - "That is, he shall be restored to the favour of
God, which is the life of the soul."

[Ezekiel 18:31](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">eze 18:31</span></span>

Make you a new heart - Suffer me to do it in you.

[Ezekiel 18:32](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">eze 18:32</span></span>

I have no pleasure - Sinners displease God when they undo themselves;
they please him when they return.
