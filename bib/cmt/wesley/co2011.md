### [2 Corinthians Chapter 11](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#001.md)

[2 Corinthians 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">co2 11:1</span></span>

I wish ye would bear - So does he pave the way for what might otherwise
have given offence. With my folly - Of commending myself; which to many
may appear folly; and really would be so, were it not on this occasion
absolutely necessary.

[2 Corinthians 11:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">co2 11:2</span></span>

For - The cause of his seeming folly is expressed in this and the
following verse; the cause why they should bear with him, [Co2
11:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#004.md).

[2 Corinthians 11:3](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">co2 11:3</span></span>

But I fear - Love is full of these fears. Lest as the serpent - A most
apposite comparison. Deceived Eve - Simple, ignorant of evil. By his
subtilty - Which is in the highest degree dangerous to such a
disposition. So your minds - We might therefore be tempted, even if
there were no sin in us. Might be corrupted - Losing their virginal
purity. From the simplicity that is in Christ - That simplicity which is
lovingly intent on him alone, seeking no other person or thing.

[2 Corinthians 11:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">co2 11:4</span></span>

If indeed - Any could show you another Saviour, a more powerful Spirit,
a better gospel. Ye might well bear with him - But this is impossible.

[2 Corinthians 11:6](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">co2 11:6</span></span>

If I am unskilful in speech - If I speak in a plain, unadorned way, like
an unlearned person. So the Greek word properly signifies.

[2 Corinthians 11:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">co2 11:7</span></span>

Have I committed an offence - Will any turn this into an objection? In
humbling myself - To work at my trade. That ye might be exalted - To be
children of God.

[2 Corinthians 11:8](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">co2 11:8</span></span>

I spoiled other churches - I, as it were, took the spoils of them: it is
a military term. Taking wages (or pay, another military word) of them -
When I came to you at first. And when I was present with you, and wanted
- My work not quite supplying my necessities. I was chargeable to no man
- Of Corinth.

[2 Corinthians 11:9](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">co2 11:9</span></span>

For - I choose to receive help from the poor Macedonians, rather than
the rich Corinthians! Were the poor in all ages more generous than the
rich?

[2 Corinthians 11:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">co2 11:10</span></span>

This my boasting shall not be stopped - For I will receive nothing from
you.

[2 Corinthians 11:11](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">co2 11:11</span></span>

Do I refuse to receive anything of you, because I love you not? God
knoweth that is not the case.

[2 Corinthians 11:12](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">co2 11:12</span></span>

Who desire any occasion - To censure me. That wherein they boast, they
may be found even as we - They boasted of being "burdensome to no man."
But it was a vain boast in them, though not in the apostle.

[2 Corinthians 11:14](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">co2 11:14</span></span>

Satan himself is transformed - Uses to transform himself; to put on the
fairest appearances.

[2 Corinthians 11:15](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">co2 11:15</span></span>

Therefore it is no great, no strange, thing; whose end, notwithstanding
all their disguises, shall be according to their works.

[2 Corinthians 11:16](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">co2 11:16</span></span>

I say again - He premises a new apology to this new commendation of
himself. Let no man think me a fool - Let none think I do this without
the utmost necessity. But if any do think me foolish herein, yet bear
with my folly.

[2 Corinthians 11:17](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">co2 11:17</span></span>

I speak not after the Lord - Not by an express command from him; though
still under the direction of his Spirit. But as it were foolishly - In
such a manner as many may think foolish.

[2 Corinthians 11:18](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">co2 11:18</span></span>

After the flesh - That is, in external things.

[2 Corinthians 11:19](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">co2 11:19</span></span>

Being wise - A beautiful irony.

[2 Corinthians 11:20](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">co2 11:20</span></span>

For ye suffer - Not only the folly, but the gross abuses, of those false
apostles. If a man enslave you - Lord it over you in the most arbitrary
manner. If he devour you - By his exorbitant demands; not - withstanding
his boast of not being burdensome. If he take from you - By open
violence. If he exalt himself - By the most unbounded self -
commendation. If he smite you on the face - (A very possible case,)
under pretence of divine zeal.

[2 Corinthians 11:21](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">co2 11:21</span></span>

I speak with regard to reproach, as though we had been weak - I say,
"Bear with me," even on supposition that the weakness be real which they
reproach me with.

[2 Corinthians 11:22](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">co2 11:22</span></span>

Are they Hebrews, Israelites, the seed of Abraham - These were the heads
on which they boasted.

[2 Corinthians 11:23](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">co2 11:23</span></span>

I am more so than they. In deaths often - Surrounding me in the most
dreadful forms.

[2 Corinthians 11:24](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">co2 11:24</span></span>

Five times I received from the Jews forty stripes save one - Which was
the utmost that the law allowed. With the Romans he sometimes pleaded
his privilege as a Roman; but from the Jews he suffered all things.

[2 Corinthians 11:25](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">co2 11:25</span></span>

Thrice I have been shipwrecked - Before his voyage to Rome. In the deep
- Probably floating on some part of the vessel.

[2 Corinthians 11:27](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">co2 11:27</span></span>

In cold and nakedness - Having no place where to lay my head; no
convenient raiment to cover me; yet appearing before noble - men,
governors, kings; and not being ashamed.

[2 Corinthians 11:28](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">co2 11:28</span></span>

Beside the things which are from without - Which I suffer on the account
of others; namely, the care of all the churches - A more modest
expression than if he had said, the care of the whole church. All - Even
those I have not seen in the flesh. St. Peter himself could not have
said this in so strong a sense.

[2 Corinthians 11:29](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">co2 11:29</span></span>

Who - So he had not only the care of the churches, but of every person
therein. Is weak, and I am not weak - By sympathy, as well as by
condescension. Who is offended - Hindered in, or turned out of, the good
way. And I burn not - Being pained as though I had fire in my bosom.

[2 Corinthians 11:30](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">co2 11:30</span></span>

I will glory of the things that concern my infirmities - Of what shows
my weakness, rather than my strength.

[2 Corinthians 11:32](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">co2 11:32</span></span>

The governor under Aretas - King of Arabia and Syria of which Damascus
was a chief city, willing to oblige the Jews, kept the city - Setting
guards at all the gates day and night.

[2 Corinthians 11:33](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">co2 11:33</span></span>

Through a window - Of an house which stood on the city wall.
