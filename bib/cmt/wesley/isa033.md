O Lord - The prophet contemplating the judgment which was now coming
upon God's people, directs his prayer to God for them. Their arm - Our
arm or strength. The change of persons is frequent in prophetical
writings. Every morning - When we offer the morning sacrifice, and call
upon thee: which yet is not meant exclusively, as if he did not desire
God's help at other times; but comprehensively, the morning being put
for the whole day. The sense is, help us speedily and continually.

Your spoil - That treasure which you have raked together, by spoiling
divers people. Gathered - By the Jews at Jerusalem, when you flee away.
Like the caterpillar - As caterpillars gather and devour the fruits of
the earth. As locusts - As locusts, especially when they are armed by
commission from God, come with great force, and run hither and thither.

[Isaiah 33:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">isa 33:11</span></span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">isa 33:14</span></span>

The sinners - This is spoken of the Jews. The prophet having foretold
the deliverance of God's people, and the destruction of their enemies,
gives a lively representation of the unbelieving condition, in which the
Jews were, before their deliverance came. Who - How shall we be able to
endure, or avoid the wrath of that God, who is a consuming fire; who is
now about to destroy us utterly by the Assyrians, and will afterwards
burn us with unquenchable fire?

The king - First Hezekiah, and then Christ, triumphing over all enemies,
and ruling his own people with righteousness. Very far - Thou shalt not
be shut up in Jerusalem, but shalt have free liberty to go abroad with
honour and safety.

[Isaiah 33:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#018.md)

Thine heart - This is a thankful acknowledgment of deliverance from
their former terrors and miseries. Where - These words they spoke in the
time of their distress. The scribe, whom we call muster - master, was to
make and keep a list of the soldiers, and to call them together as
occasion required: the receiver, received and laid out the money for the
charges of the war; and he that counted the towers, surveyed all the
parts of the city, and considered what towers or fortifications were to
be made or repaired. And unto these several officers the people
resorted, with great distraction and confusion.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">isa 33:20</span></span>

Look upon - Contemplate Zion's glorious and peculiar privileges.
Solemnities - This was the chief part of Zion's glory, that God was
solemnly worshipped, and the solemn assemblies and feasts kept in her.
Quiet - This was but imperfectly fulfilled in the literal Zion; but
clearly and fully in the mystical Zion, the church of God, in the times
of the gospel.

[Isaiah 33:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">isa 33:21</span></span>

There - In and about Zion. Rivers - Tho' we have nothing but a small and
contemptible brook to defend us; yet God will be as sure a defence to
us, as if we were surrounded with great rivers. No galley - No ships of
the enemies shall be able to come into this river to annoy them.

[Isaiah 33:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">isa 33:22</span></span>

Is judge - To plead our cause against our enemies. Lawgiver - Our chief
governor, to whom it belongs, to give laws, and to defend his people.

[Isaiah 33:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">isa 33:23</span></span>

Tacklings - He directs his speech to the Assyrians; and having designed
their army under the notion of a gallant ship, [Isa
33:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#021.md), he here represents their undone
condition, by the metaphor of a ship, tossed in a tempestuous sea,
having her cables broke, and all her tacklings loose, so that she could
have no benefit of her masts and sails; and therefore is quickly
swallowed up. The lame - They shall leave so many spoils behind them,
that there shall be enough left for the lame, who come last to the
spoil.

[Isaiah 33:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">isa 33:24</span></span>

The inhabitant - Of Jerusalem. Sick - Shall have no cause to complain of
any sickness or calamity. Forgiven - They shall not only receive from me
a glorious temporal deliverance; but, which is infinitely better, the
pardon of all their sins, and all those spiritual and everlasting
blessings, which attend upon that mercy.
