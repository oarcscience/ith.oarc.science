### [Daniel Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#001.md)

[Daniel 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">dan 7:1</span></span>

In the first year of Belshazzar - This prophecy is written in Chaldee,
to be a monument to him, of the reverence his father and grandfather
shewed towards God, who had done such mighty works for them. Then he
wrote - These visions were recorded for the benefit of the church, to
rectify their mistake: for they thought all things would succeed
prosperously after they returned out of their captivity.

[Daniel 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">dan 7:2</span></span>

The four winds - Probably by the four winds of the great sea is
signified commotions of contrary nations, striving together by wars, and
producing these four beasts successively.

[Daniel 7:3](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">dan 7:3</span></span>

Four great beasts - That is, four great monarchies, great, in comparison
of particular kingdoms; beasts for their tyrannical oppressions.

[Daniel 7:4](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">dan 7:4</span></span>

The first - This was the Chaldean, or Assyrian; whose seat was first at
Babylon, afterwards at Nineveh, and then at Babylon again. Eagle's wings
- They were swift, over - running many countries, and brought their
monarchy to a prodigious height in a short time. The wings were plucked
- Which was first done in stopping the career of their victories, and
afterwards in casting them out of their kingdom. A man's heart - They
lost their lion - like courage, and became faint and cowardly like other
men.

[Daniel 7:5](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">dan 7:5</span></span>

Another beast - The Mede's and Persians, a fierce, ravenous creature. On
one side - The north side; for the Mede first arose and sent to Cyrus
the Persian to come and assist him against the Assyrian. Three ribs -
Several of the Babylonian subjects revolted, and all these made the
three ribs.

[Daniel 7:6](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">dan 7:6</span></span>

Like a leopard - This leopard was the Grecian monarchy; a leopard is
less than a lion, so was this monarchy at first, but yet durst fight
with a lion; so did Alexander encounter Darius with an inferior force. A
leopard also for his swiftness; therefore described with four wings on
his back. Four heads - He was succeeded by four of his chief commanders,
who divided that empire into four parts.

[Daniel 7:7](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">dan 7:7</span></span>

A fourth beast - The Roman empire.

[Daniel 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">dan 7:8</span></span>

Another little horn - Probably either the Turk or the Romish antichrist.

[Daniel 7:9](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">dan 7:9</span></span>

The thrones - The kingdoms of this world were destroyed by God the king,
and judge of all, called the Ancient of days, because of his eternal
deity.

[Daniel 7:11](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">dan 7:11</span></span>

Destroyed - This cannot but be meant of the ruin and judgment of
antichrist.

[Daniel 7:13](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">dan 7:13</span></span>

A son of man - That is, the Messiah, he came with the clouds of heaven,
gloriously, swiftly and terribly. And came - This relates to his
ascension, at which time, he received his royal investiture, for the
protection of his church, and curbing of their enemies.

[Daniel 7:16](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">dan 7:16</span></span>

Unto one - That is, to an angel, that ministered. The truth - The true
meaning of this vision.

[Daniel 7:18](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">dan 7:18</span></span>

But the saints - Jesus Christ being their king, they shall reign with
him, and possess the kingdom for ever.

[Daniel 7:24](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">dan 7:24</span></span>

And another - This seems to mean the Romish antichrist.

[Daniel 7:25](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">dan 7:25</span></span>

Until a time and times - The numbers of Daniel and John seem to agree.
Daniel was certainly prophetical in these things, and his prophecy
reacheth to the end of times, even of antichrist's reign.

[Daniel 7:28](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">dan 7:28</span></span>

Of the matter - Of the vision, and the angel's interpretation.
