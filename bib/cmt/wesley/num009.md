### [Numbers Chapter 9](../../../bib/kjv/num009.htm#001.md)

[Numbers 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/num009.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">num 9:1</span></span>

In the first month - And therefore before the numbering of the people,
which was not till the second month, [Num
1:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#001.md). But it is placed after it,
because of a special case relating to the passover, which happened after
it, upon occasion whereof he mentions the command of God for keeping the
passover in the wilderness, which was done but once, and without this
command they had not been obliged to keep it at all, till they came to
the land of Canaan.

[Numbers 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/num009.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">num 9:6</span></span>

They came - For resolution of their difficulty.

[Numbers 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/num009.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">num 9:7</span></span>

An offering - Which if we neglect, we must be cut off, and if we keep it
in these circumstances, we must also be cut off. What shall we do?

[Numbers 9:10](../../../bib/kjv/num009.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">num 9:10</span></span>

Unclean or in a journey - Under these two instances the Hebrews think
that other hindrances of like nature are comprehended; as if one be
hindered by a disease, or by any other such kind of uncleanness; which
may seem probable both from the nature of the thing, and the reason of
the law which is the same in other cases.

[Numbers 9:14](../../../bib/kjv/num009.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">num 9:14</span></span>

A stranger - Who is a proselyte.

[Numbers 9:15](../../../bib/kjv/num009.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">num 9:15</span></span>

Namely, the tent of the testimony - Or, the tabernacle above the tent of
the testimony, that is, that part of the tabernacle in which was the
testimony, or the ark of the testimony; for there the cloudy pillar
stood. This was an evident token of God's special presence with, and
providence over them. And this cloud was easily distinguished from other
clouds, both by its peculiar figure and by its constant residence in
that place. Fire - That they might better discern it and direct
themselves and their journeys or stations by it. Had it been a cloud
only, it had scarce been visible by night: And had it been a fire only,
it would have been scarce discernable by day. But God was pleased to
give them sensible demonstrations, that he kept them night and day.

[Numbers 9:17](../../../bib/kjv/num009.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">num 9:17</span></span>

Was taken up - Or, ascended on high, above its ordinary place, by which
it became more visible to all the camp.

[Numbers 9:18](../../../bib/kjv/num009.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">num 9:18</span></span>

The motion or stay of the cloud is fitly called the command of God,
because it was a signification of God's will and their duty.

[Numbers 9:19](../../../bib/kjv/num009.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">num 9:19</span></span>

The charge - That is, the command of God, that they should stay as long
as the cloud stayed.

[Numbers 9:21](../../../bib/kjv/num009.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">num 9:21</span></span>

When the cloud abode - This is repeated again and again, because it was
a constant miracle, and because it is a matter we should take particular
notice of, as highly significant and instructive. It is mentioned long
after by David, [Psa 105:39](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#039.md), and by
the people of God after their captivity, [Neh
9:19](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#019.md). And the guidance of this cloud
is spoken of, as signifying the guidance of the Blessed Spirit, [Isa
63:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#014.md). The Spirit of the Lord caused
him to rest, and so didst thou lead the people.

And thus, in effect, does he guide, all those, who commit their ways
unto the Lord. So that they may well say, Father, thy will be done!
Dispose of me and mine as thou pleasest. Here I am, waiting on my God,
to journey and rest at the commandment of the Lord. What thou wilt, and
where thou wilt: only let me be thine, and always in the way of my duty.
