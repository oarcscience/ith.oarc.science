### [Jeremiah Chapter 40](../../../bib/kjv/jer040.htm#001.md)

[Jeremiah 40:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer040.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 40:1</span></span>

Ramah - Ramah was a city in the tribe of Benjamin near Gibeon. Babylon -
Jeremiah was by mistake and expressly contrary to the king's orders
carried amongst the other prisoners; probably the captain of the guard
at that place called over his prisoners, and among them found the
prophet contrary to his expectation.

[Jeremiah 40:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer040.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jer 40:5</span></span>

Now - Jeremiah before he was gone out of the presence of Nebuzar - adan,
declaring that he was more inclined to stay in his own country, Nebuzar
- adan bid him, Go back.

[Jeremiah 40:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer040.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jer 40:8</span></span>

Ishmael - It is likely these were commanders of parties, which either
were within the city 'till it was taken, and then escaped, or where
somewhere in the country, and not so much regarded by the Chaldeans, who
were more intent upon the conquest of the city, than pursuing these
little parties.

[Jeremiah 40:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer040.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jer 40:10</span></span>

I will dwell - I have choice made of Mizpah, a city upon the frontiers,
to make my residence, it being a convenient place for me to receive
orders from the king of Babylon. But ye - Gather such fruits as the
country affords, as you use to do in the times of peace.

[Jeremiah 40:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer040.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jer 40:12</span></span>

Returned - Probably upon the king of Babylon's first invading Judah,
many fled, and more as he went on his conquests, over - running the
country; and it is likely at the taking of the city, many escaped, and
fled into several countries, as they had opportunity, or judged this or
that country would be safest; some fled to Moab, some to Ammon some to
Edom, some one way, and some another: but when they heard that the king
of Babylon had set a governor of their own religion and country over
them, they came back to him; and there being few people left in the
land, which was wonderfully fruitful, they gathered plenty of grapes,
and other summer fruits.

[Jeremiah 40:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer040.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jer 40:13</span></span>

Moreover - They had been with him before, but now they come to discover
a conspiracy against his life.
