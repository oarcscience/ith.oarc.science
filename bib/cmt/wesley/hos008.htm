<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#001">Hosea 8:1</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">hos 8:1</A></FONT></span></p>Set the trumpet - The Lord here commands the prophet to publish, as by sound of trumpet, that which God will bring upon apostate Israel. He - The king of Assyria. As an eagle - Swift, hungry, surmounting all difficulties. House of the Lord - The family of Israel, the Israelites church. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#002">Hosea 8:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">hos 8:2</A></FONT></span></p>Shall cry - But not sincerely. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#004">Hosea 8:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">hos 8:4</A></FONT></span></p>They - Israel. Kings - Shallum, Menahem, Pekah, and Hosea. Not by me - Not by my direction. Knew it not - Did not approve of it. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#005">Hosea 8:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">hos 8:5</A></FONT></span></p>Thy calf - The chief idol set up in Samaria. Cast thee off - Hath provoked God to cast thee off. Against them - Idols, and idol worshippers. How long - How long will it be, ere they repent and reform? 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#006">Hosea 8:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">hos 8:6</A></FONT></span></p>From Israel - By their invention. It - Both the idol and the worshippers of it. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#007">Hosea 8:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">hos 8:7</A></FONT></span></p>Sown the wind - A proverbial speech to denote lost labour. Whirlwind - A tempest, which destroyeth all that is in its way; an emblem of the wrath of God. No stalk - All your dependance on idols, and foreign assistance, will be as seed that bear neither stalk nor bud. No meal - Or suppose it produced stalk and bud, yet the bud shall be blasted, and never yield meal. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#009">Hosea 8:9</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">hos 8:9</A></FONT></span></p>Gone up - Israel is like a wild ass. A wild ass - Stubborn, wild, untamed. Alone - Solitary, where is no path or tract; so they were in their captivity. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#010">Hosea 8:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">hos 8:10</A></FONT></span></p>Gather them - I will assemble them together, that they may be taken and destroyed together. A little - For a while before their final captivity. The burden - The tribute laid on them by the king. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#011">Hosea 8:11</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_011">hos 8:11</A></FONT></span></p>Altars - Those which they shall find in Assyria. To sin - Shall be the occasion of his greater guilt and punishment. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#012">Hosea 8:12</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_012">hos 8:12</A></FONT></span></p>Written - By Moses first, by other prophets afterwards. But they were counted - Israel looks on them, as nothing to them. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#013">Hosea 8:13</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_013">hos 8:13</A></FONT></span></p>They shall return - Many shall fly from the Assyrian into Egypt. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#014">Hosea 8:14</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_014">hos 8:14</A></FONT></span></p>Temples - Idol temples. Devour the palaces - This was fulfilled when all the cities of Judah and Israel were laid in ashes by the king of Assyria.
