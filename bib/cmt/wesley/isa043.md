### [Isaiah Chapter 43](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah 43:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 43:1</span></span>

But - Notwithstanding thy gross insensibleness, I will deal mercifully
with thee. Created - That made thee his people, and that in so
miraculous a manner as if he had created thee a second time. Redeemed -
From the Egyptians. Called thee - By the name of God's people, which was
as proper and peculiar to them, as the name of Israel.

[Isaiah 43:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 43:3</span></span>

I gave Egypt - This was fulfilled when the king of Assyria, Esar -
haddon, who designed to revenge his father's disgrace, upon the Jews,
was diverted and directed by God to employ his forces against Egypt, and
Ethiopia, and Seba. Seba - The Sabaeans were confederate with the
Ethiopians.

[Isaiah 43:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 43:4</span></span>

Since - From the time that I chose thee for my people, I have had an
affection for thee. Men - As I gave up the Egyptians, so I am ready to
give up others to save thee, as occasion requires.

[Isaiah 43:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">isa 43:7</span></span>

For my glory - And therefore I will glorify my power and goodness, and
faithfulness in delivering them. Formed - I have not only created them
out of nothing, but I have also formed and made them my peculiar people.

[Isaiah 43:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">isa 43:8</span></span>

Bring - O ye idolatrous Gentiles, bring forth your false gods, which
have eyes but see not, and ears but hear not.

[Isaiah 43:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">isa 43:9</span></span>

Assembled - To plead the cause of their idols with me. This - This
wonderful work of mine in bringing my people out of captivity. Former
things - Such things as shall happen long before the return from the
captivity, which yet your blind idols cannot foresee. Witnesses - Who
can testify the truth of any such predictions of theirs, that they may
be owned for true gods; or if they can produce no evidence of any such
thing, let them confess, that what I say is truth, that I only am the
true God.

[Isaiah 43:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">isa 43:10</span></span>

Ye - You my people are able to witness for me, that I have given you
plain demonstrations of my certain knowledge of future events. My
servant - Cyrus who is an eminent instance and proof of God's
foreknowledge: or, the Messiah, who is the most eminent witness in this
cause. Understand - That I am the true God. Nor after me - The gods of
the Heathens neither had a being before me nor shall continue after me:
whereas the Lord is God from everlasting to everlasting; but these
pretenders are but of yesterday. And withal he calls them formed gods,
in a way of contempt, and to shew the ridiculousness of their pretence.

[Isaiah 43:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">isa 43:12</span></span>

I - I first foretold your deliverance, and then effected it. When - And
this I did when you did not worship any idols.

[Isaiah 43:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">isa 43:13</span></span>

Yea - Before all time; from all eternity, I am God.

[Isaiah 43:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">isa 43:14</span></span>

Sent - I have sent Cyrus against Babylon, to this very end, that he
might deliver you out of captivity. Chaldeans - The common people of
Chaldea, who make fearful outcries, as they flee away from the Persians
in ships.

[Isaiah 43:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">isa 43:17</span></span>

The chariot - Pharaoh and his chariots and horses, and army. Lay down -
In the bottom of the sea. They never rose again to molest the
Israelites. Quenched - As the wick of a candle when it is put into the
water, is extinguished.

[Isaiah 43:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">isa 43:18</span></span>

Remember not - Tho' your former deliverance out of Egypt was glorious:
yet in comparison of that inestimable mercy of sending the Messiah, all
your former deliverances are scarce worthy of your remembrance and
consideration.

[Isaiah 43:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">isa 43:19</span></span>

A new thing - Such a work as was never yet done in the world. Now - The
scripture often speaks of things at a great distance of time, as if they
were now at hand; to make us sensible of the inconsiderableness of time,
and all temporal things, in comparison of God, and eternal things; upon
which account it is said, that a thousand years are in God's sight but
as one day.

[Isaiah 43:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">isa 43:20</span></span>

The beast - Shall have cause, if they had abilities, to praise me for
their share in this mercy. Dragons - Which live in dry and barren
deserts.

[Isaiah 43:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">isa 43:22</span></span>

For - God called to the Gentiles to be his people, because the Jews
forsook him. Weary - Thou hast not esteemed my service to be a
privilege, but a burden and bondage.

[Isaiah 43:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">isa 43:23</span></span>

Honoured - Either thou didst neglect sacrificing to me; or didst perform
it merely out of custom or didst dishonour me, and pollute thy
sacrifices by thy wicked life. Although - Altho' God had not laid such
heavy burdens upon them, nor required such costly offerings, as might
give them cause to be weary, nor such as idolaters did freely perform in
the service of their idols.

[Isaiah 43:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">isa 43:24</span></span>

Sweet cane - This was used in the making of that precious ointment, [Exo
30:34](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#034.md), and for the incense, [Exo
30:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#007.md). Thou hast been niggardly in my
service, when thou hast, spared for no cost in the service of thine
idols. Nor filled me - Thou hast not multiplied thy thank - offerings
and free - will offerings, tho' I have given thee sufficient occasion to
do so. But - Thou hast made me to bear the load and burden of thy sins.

[Isaiah 43:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">isa 43:25</span></span>

I - I whom thou hast thus provoked. Mine own sake - Not for thy merits,
but my own mere goodness.

[Isaiah 43:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">isa 43:26</span></span>

Put me - I remember nothing by which thou hast deserved my favour.

[Isaiah 43:27](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">isa 43:27</span></span>

Thy father - This may be put for their forefathers; and so he tells
them, that as they were sinners, so also were their progenitors, yea
even the best of them. Teachers - Thy priests and prophets; who were
their intercessors with God: and if these were transgressors, the people
had no reason to fancy themselves innocent.

[Isaiah 43:28](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">isa 43:28</span></span>

Therefore - I have exposed them to contempt and destruction. Princes -
The highest and best of your priests. Curse - To utter destruction, to
which persons or things accursed were devoted.
