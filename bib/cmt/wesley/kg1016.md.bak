### [3 Kings (1 Kings) Chapter 16](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#001.md)

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 16:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg1 16:1</span></span>

Hanani - He was sent to Asa, king of Judah. But the son, who was young
and more active, was sent on this longer and more dangerous expedition
to Baasha, king of Israel.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 16:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">kg1 16:2</span></span>

I made thee - Though that invading the kingdom was from himself, and his
own wicked heart; yet the translation of the kingdom from Nadab to
Baasha simply considered, was from God, who by his providence disposed
of all occasions, and of the hearts of the soldiers and people, so that
Baasha should have opportunity of executing God's judgment upon Nadab;
nay, the very act of Baasha, the killing his master Nadab, was an act of
divine justice. And if Baasha had done this in obedience to God's
command, and with a single design, to execute God's vengeance threatened
against him, it had been no more a sin, than Jehu's act in killing his
master king Jehoram, upon the same account, [Kg2
9:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#024.md). But Baasha did this, merely to
gratify his own pride, or covetousness, or malice, [Kg1
16:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#007.md).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 16:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">kg1 16:7</span></span>

Came, &c. - The meaning is, the message which came from the Lord to
Jehu, [Kg1 16:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#001.md), &c. was here
delivered by the hand, the ministry of Jehu, unto Baasha. Jehu did what
God commanded him in this matter, tho' it was not without apparent
hazard to himself.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 16:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">kg1 16:8</span></span>

Two years - One compleat, and part of the other, [Kg1
16:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#010.md).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 16:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">kg1 16:9</span></span>

Chariots - Of all his military chariots, and the men belonging to them:
the chariots for carriage of necessary things, being put into meaner
hands. Tirzah - Whilst his forces were elsewhere employed, [Kg1
16:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#015.md), which gave Zimri advantage to
execute his design.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 16:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">kg1 16:11</span></span>

Kinfolks - Heb. avengers; to whom it belonged to revenge his death.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 16:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">kg1 16:13</span></span>

Vanities - Idols called vanities; because they are but imaginary
deities, and mere nothings; having no power to do either good or hurt.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 16:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">kg1 16:15</span></span>

Gibbethon - Which had been besieged before, but, it seems, was then
relieved, or afterwards recovered by the Philistines; taking the
advantage of the disorders and contentions which were among their
enemies.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 16:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">kg1 16:19</span></span>

For his sins - This befell him for his sins. In walking, &c. - This he
might do, either before his reign, in the whole course of his life,
which is justly charged upon him, because of his impenitency: or during
his short reign; in which, he had time enough to publish his intentions,
about the worship of the calves; or to sacrifice to them, for his good
success.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 16:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">kg1 16:21</span></span>

Were divided - Fell into a civil war: yet neither this, nor any other of
God's dreadful judgments could win them to repentance.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 16:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">kg1 16:22</span></span>

Prevailed - Partly, because they had the army on their side; and
principally, by the appointment of God, giving up the Israelites to him
who was much the worst, [Kg1 16:25-26](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#025.md).
Died - A violent death, in the battle: but not till after a struggle of
some years. But why in all these confusions of the kingdom of Israel,
did they never think of returning to the house of David? Probably
because the kings of Judah assumed a more absolute power than the kings
of Israel. It was the heaviness of the yoke that they complained of,
when they first revolted from the house of David. And it is not
unlikely, the dread of that made them averse to it ever after.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 16:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">kg1 16:23</span></span>

Twelve years - That is, and he reigned twelve years, not from this
thirty - first year of Asa, for he died in his thirty - eighth year,
[Kg1 16:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#029.md), but from the beginning of
his reign, which was in Asa's twenty - seventh year, [Kg1
16:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#015.md). So he reigned four years in
a state of war with Tibni, and eight years peaceably.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 16:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">kg1 16:24</span></span>

Two talents - Two talents is something more than seven hundred pounds.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 16:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">kg1 16:26</span></span>

Did worse - Perhaps he made severer laws concerning the calf worship;
whence we read of the statutes of Omri, [Mic
6:16](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#016.md).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 16:31](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">kg1 16:31</span></span>

A light thing - The Hebrew runs, was it a light thing, &c, that is, was
this but a small sin, that therefore he needed to add more abominations?
Where the question, as is usual among the Hebrews, implies a strong
denial; and intimates, that this was no small sin, but a great crime;
and might have satisfied his wicked mind, without any additions. Jezebel
- A woman infamous for her idolatry, and cruelty, and sorcery, and
filthiness. Eth - baal - Called Ithbalus, or Itobalus in heathen
writers. So she was of an heathenish and idolatrous race. Such as the
kings and people of Israel were expressly forbidden to marry. Baal - The
idol which the Sidonians worshipped, which is thought to be Hercules.
And this idolatry was much worse than that of the calves; because in the
calves they worshipped the true God; but in these, false gods or devils.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 16:34](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">kg1 16:34</span></span>

In his days - This is added, as an instance of the certainty of divine
predictions, this being fulfilled eight hundred years after it was
threatened; and withal, as a warning to the Israelites, not to think
themselves innocent or safe, because the judgment threatened against
them by Ahijah, [Kg1 14:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#015.md), was not
yet executed. Or, as an evidence of the horrible corruption of his
times, and of that high contempt of God which then reigned. The
Bethelite - Who lived in Bethel, the seat and sink of idolatry,
wherewith he was throughly leavened. He laid, &c. - That is, in the
beginning of his building, God took away his first - born, and others
successively in the progress of the work, and the youngest when he
finished it. And so he found by his own sad experience, the truth of
God's word.
