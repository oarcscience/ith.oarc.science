### [Judges Chapter 8](../../../bib/kjv/jdg008.htm#001.md)

[Judges 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg008.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jdg 8:1</span></span>

Why haft thou, &c. - Why hast thou neglected and despised us, in not
calling us in to thy help, as thou didst other tribes? These were a
proud people, puffed up with a conceit of their number and strength, and
the preference which Jacob gave them above Manasseh, of which tribe
Gideon was, who by this act had seemed to advance his own tribe, and to
depress theirs.

[Judges 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/jdg008.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jdg 8:2</span></span>

What have I, &c. - What I have done in cutting off some of the common
soldiers, is not to be compared with your destroying their princes; I
began the war, but you have finished. The gleaning - What you have
gleaned or done after me, Of Abiezer - That is, of the Abiezrites, to
whom he modestly communicates the honour of the victory, and does not
arrogate it to himself.

[Judges 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/jdg008.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jdg 8:3</span></span>

Was abated - His soft and humble answer allayed their rage.

[Judges 8:4](../../../bib/kjv/jdg008.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jdg 8:4</span></span>

Passed over - Or, had passed over.

[Judges 8:6](../../../bib/kjv/jdg008.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jdg 8:6</span></span>

Are the hands, &c. - Art thou so foolish, to think with thy three
hundred faint and weary soldiers, to conquer and destroy an host of
fifteen thousand Men? Thus the bowels of their compassion were shut up
against their brethren. Were these Israelites! Surely they were
worshippers of Baal, or in the interest of Midian.

[Judges 8:8](../../../bib/kjv/jdg008.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jdg 8:8</span></span>

Penuel - Another city beyond Jordan; both were in the tribe of Gad.

[Judges 8:9](../../../bib/kjv/jdg008.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jdg 8:9</span></span>

Your tower - Your confidence in which makes you thus proud and
presumptuous.

[Judges 8:10](../../../bib/kjv/jdg008.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jdg 8:10</span></span>

That drew sword - That is, persons expert and exercised in war, besides
the retainers to them.

[Judges 8:11](../../../bib/kjv/jdg008.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jdg 8:11</span></span>

That dwelt in tents - That is, of the Arabians, so fetching a compass,
and falling upon them where they least expected it. Was secure - Being
now got safe over Jordan, and a great way from the place of battle; and
probably, supposing Gideon's men to be so tired with their hard service,
that they would have neither strength nor will to pursue them so far.

[Judges 8:13](../../../bib/kjv/jdg008.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jdg 8:13</span></span>

Before the sun was up - By which it might be gathered, that he came upon
them in the night, which was most convenient for him who had so small a
number with him; and most likely to terrify them by the remembrance of
the last Night's sad work.

[Judges 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/jdg008.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jdg 8:14</span></span>

He described - He told him their names and qualities.

[Judges 8:17](../../../bib/kjv/jdg008.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jdg 8:17</span></span>

Slew the men of the city - Not all of them; probably those only who had
affronted him.

[Judges 8:18](../../../bib/kjv/jdg008.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jdg 8:18</span></span>

What manner of men - For outward shape and quality. At Tabor - Whither
he understood they fled for shelter, upon the approach of the
Midianites; and where he learned that some were slain, which he
suspected might be them. Resembled - Not for their garb, or outward
splendor, but for the majesty of their looks: by which commendation they
thought to ingratiate themselves with their conqueror.

[Judges 8:19](../../../bib/kjv/jdg008.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">jdg 8:19</span></span>

I would not slay - For being not Canaanites, he was not obliged to kill
them; but they having killed his brethren, and that in cool blood, he
was by law the avenger of their blood.

[Judges 8:20](../../../bib/kjv/jdg008.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">jdg 8:20</span></span>

Up, and slay - That he might animate him to the use of arms for his God
and country, and that he might have a share in the honour of the
victory.

[Judges 8:21](../../../bib/kjv/jdg008.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">jdg 8:21</span></span>

So is his strength - Thou excellest him, as in age and stature, so in
strength; and it is more honourable to die by the hands of a valiant
man.

[Judges 8:22](../../../bib/kjv/jdg008.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">jdg 8:22</span></span>

Rule - Not as a judge, for that he was already made by God; but as a
king. Thy son's son - Let the kingdom be hereditary to thee, and to thy
family. Thou hast delivered us - This miraculous and glorious
deliverance by thy hands deserves no less from us.

[Judges 8:23](../../../bib/kjv/jdg008.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">jdg 8:23</span></span>

I will not rule - As a king. The Lord shall rule - In a special manner,
as he hath hitherto done, by judges, whom God particularly appointed and
directed, even by Urim and Thummim, and assisted upon all occasions;
whereas Kings had only a general dependance upon God.

[Judges 8:24](../../../bib/kjv/jdg008.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">jdg 8:24</span></span>

Ishmaelites - A mixture of people all called by one general name,
Ishmaelites or Arabians, who used to wear ear - rings; but the greatest,
and the ruling part of them were Midianites.

[Judges 8:27](../../../bib/kjv/jdg008.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">jdg 8:27</span></span>

Thereof - Not of all of it; for then it would have been too heavy for
use; but of part of it, the rest being probably employed about other
things appertaining to it; which elsewhere are comprehended under the
name of the ephod, as [Jdg 17:5](../../../bib/kjv/jdg017.htm#005.md). Put
it - Not as a monument of the victory, for such monuments were neither
proper nor usual; but for religious use, for which alone the ephod was
appointed. The case seems to be this; Gideon having by God's command
erected an altar in his own city, Ophrah, [Jdg
6:24](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#024.md), for an extraordinary time and
occasion, thought it might be continued for ordinary use; and therefore
as he intended to procure priests, so he designed to make priestly
garments, and especially an ephod, which was the chief and most costly;
which besides its use in sacred ministrations, was also the instrument
by which the mind of God was enquired and discovered, [Sa1
26:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#006.md), [Sa1
26:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#009.md), and it might seen necessary for
the judge to have this at hand, that he might consult with God upon all
occasions. Went a whoring - Committed idolatry with it; or went thither
to enquire the will of God; whereby they were drawn from the true ephod,
instituted by God for this end, which was to be worn by the high -
priest only. A snare - An occasion of sin and ruin to him and his, as
the next chapter sheweth. Though Gideon was a good man, and did this
with an honest mind, and a desire to set up religion in his own city and
family; yet here seem to be many sins in it; Superstition and will -
worship, worshipping God by a device of his own, which was expressly
forbidden. Presumption, in wearing or causing other priests to wear this
kind of ephod, which was peculiar to the high - priest. Transgression of
a plain command, of worshipping God ordinarily but at one place, and one
altar, [Deu 12:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#005.md), [Deu
12:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#011.md), [Deu
12:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#014.md). Making a division among the
people. Laying a stumbling - block, or an occasion of idolatry before
that people, whom he knew to be too prone to it.

[Judges 8:28](../../../bib/kjv/jdg008.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">jdg 8:28</span></span>

Lifted up their head - That is, recovered not their former strength or
courage, so as to conquer or oppress others. Forty years - To the
fortieth year, from the beginning of the Midianitish oppression. The
days, &c. - As long as Gideon lived.

[Judges 8:29](../../../bib/kjv/jdg008.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">jdg 8:29</span></span>

His own house - Not in his father's house; as he did before; nor yet in
a court like a king, as the people desired; but in a middle state, as a
judge for the preservation and maintenance of their religion and
liberties.

[Judges 8:31](../../../bib/kjv/jdg008.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">jdg 8:31</span></span>

Shechem - She dwelt there, and he often came thither, either to execute
judgment, or upon other occasions. Abimelech - That is, my father the
king; so he called him, probably, to gratify his concubine, who desired
it either out of pride, or design.

[Judges 8:32](../../../bib/kjv/jdg008.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">jdg 8:32</span></span>

A good old age - His long life being crowned with the continuance of
honour, tranquility, and happiness.

[Judges 8:33](../../../bib/kjv/jdg008.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">jdg 8:33</span></span>

As soon as, &c. - Whereby we see the temper of this people, who did no
longer cleave to God, than they were in a manner constrained to it, by
the presence and authority of their judges. Baalim - This was the
general name including all their idols, one of which here follows. Baal
- berith - That is, the Lord of the covenant; so called, either from the
covenant wherewith the worshippers of this god bound themselves to
maintain his worship, or to defend one another therein; or rather,
because he was reputed the god and judge of all covenants, and promises,
and contracts, to whom it belonged to maintain them, and to punish the
violaters of them; and such a god both the Grecians and the Romans had.
