### [1 Corinthians Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#001)

[1 Corinthians 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">co1 5:1</span></span>

Fornication - The original word implies criminal conversation of any
kind whatever. His father's wife - While his father was alive.

[1 Corinthians 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">co1 5:2</span></span>

Are ye puffed up? Should ye not rather have mourned - Have solemnly
humbled yourselves, and at that time of solemn mourning have expelled
that notorious sinner from your communion?

[1 Corinthians 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">co1 5:3</span></span>

I verily, as present in spirit - Having a full (it seems, a miraculous)
view of the whole fact. Have already, as if I were actually present,
judged him who hath so scandalously done this.

[1 Corinthians 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">co1 5:4</span></span>

And my spirit - Present with you. With the power of the Lord Jesus
Christ - To confirm my sentence.

[1 Corinthians 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">co1 5:5</span></span>

To deliver such an one - This was the highest degree of punishment in
the Christian church; and we may observe, the passing this sentence was
the act of the apostle, not of the Corinthians. To Satan - Who was
usually permitted, in such cases, to inflict pain or sickness on the
offender. For the destruction - Though slowly and gradually. Of the
flesh - Unless prevented by speedy repentance.

[1 Corinthians 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">co1 5:6</span></span>

Your glorying - Either in your gifts or prosperity, at such a time as
this, is not good. Know ye not that a little leaven - One sin, or one
sinner. Leaveneth the whole lump - Diffuses guilt and infection through
the whole congregation.

[1 Corinthians 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">co1 5:7</span></span>

Purge out therefore the old leaven - Both of sinners and of sin. That ye
may be a new lump, as ye are unleavened - That is, that being unleavened
ye may be a new lump, holy unto the Lord. For our passover is slain for
us - The Jewish passover, about the time of which this epistle was
wrote, [Co1 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#011), was only a type of
this. What exquisite skill both here and everywhere conducts the zeal of
the inspired writer! How surprising a transition is here, and yet how
perfectly natural! The apostle, speaking of the incestuous criminal,
slides into his darling topic, - crucified Saviour. Who would have
expected it on such an occasion. Yet, when it is thus brought in, who
does not see and admire both the propriety of the subject, and the
delicacy of its introduction?

[1 Corinthians 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">co1 5:8</span></span>

Therefore let us keep the feast - Let us feed on him by faith. Here is a
plain allusion to the Lord's supper, which was instituted in the room of
the passover. Not with the old leaven - Of heathenism or Judaism.
Malignity is stubbornness in evil. Sincerity and truth seem to be put
here for the whole of true, inward religion.

[1 Corinthians 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">co1 5:9</span></span>

I wrote to you in a former epistle - And, doubtless, both St. Paul and
the other apostles wrote many things which are not extant now. Not to
converse - Familiarly; not to contract any intimacy or acquaintance with
them, more than is absolutely necessary.

[1 Corinthians 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">co1 5:10</span></span>

But I did not mean that you should altogether refrain from conversing
with heathens, though they are guilty in some of these respects.
Covetous, rapacious, idolaters - Sinners against themselves, their
neighbour, God. For then ye must go out of the world - Then all civil
commerce must cease. So that going out of the world, which some account
a perfection, St. Paul accounts an utter absurdity.

[1 Corinthians 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">co1 5:11</span></span>

Who is named a brother - That is, a Christian; especially if a member of
the same congregation. Rapacious - Guilty of oppression, extortion, or
any open injustice. No, not to eat with him - Which is the lowest degree
of familiarity.

[1 Corinthians 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">co1 5:12</span></span>

I speak of Christians only. For what have I to do to judge heathens? But
ye, as well as I, judge those of your own community.

[1 Corinthians 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">co1 5:13</span></span>

Them that are without God will judge - The passing sentence on these he
hath reserved to himself. And ye will take away that wicked person -
This properly belongs to you.
