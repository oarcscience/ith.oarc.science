### [2 Kings (2 Samuel) Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#001.md)

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa2 1:1</span></span>

Ziklag - Which though burnt, yet was not so consumed by the fire, that
David and his men could not lodge in it.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">sa2 1:2</span></span>

Third day - From David's return to Ziklag. With his clothes rent, &c. -
As a mourner.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">sa2 1:18</span></span>

Judah - These he more particularly teacheth, because they were the
chief, and now the royal tribe, and likely to be the great bulwark to
all Israel against the Philistines, upon whose land they bordered; and
withal, to be the most true to him, and to his interest. The bow - That
is, of their arms, expressed, under the name of the bow, which then was
one of the chief weapons; and for the dextrous use whereof Jonathan is
commended in the following song: which may be one reason, why he now
gives forth this order, that so they might strive to imitate Jonathan in
military skill, and to excel in it, as he did. Jasher - It is more
largely and particularly described in the book of Jasher.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">sa2 1:19</span></span>

Beauty - Their flower and glory. Saul and Jonathan, and their army. High
places - Heb. upon thy high places; that is, those which belong to thee,
O land of Israel. How - How strangely! How suddenly! How universally!

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">sa2 1:20</span></span>

Tell it not - This is not a precept, but a poetical wish; whereby he
doth not so much desire, that this might not be done, which he knew to
be impossible; as, express his great sorrow, because it would be done,
to the dishonour of God, and of his people. The daughters - He mentions
these, because it was the custom of women in those times and places to
celebrate those victories which their men obtained, with triumphant
songs and dances.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">sa2 1:21</span></span>

Let there be, &c. - This is no proper imprecation; but a passionate
representation of the horror which he conceived at this publick loss;
which was such, as if he thought every person or thing which contributed
to it, were fit to bear the tokens of divine displeasure, such as this
is, when the earth wants the necessary influences of dew and rain.
Fields of offerings - That is, fruitful fields, which may produce fair
and goodly fruits fit to be offered to God. Vilely - Dishonourably: for
it was a great reproach to any soldier, to cast away or lose his shield.
Cast away - By themselves, that they might flee more swiftly as the
Israelites did, and Saul with the rest. As though, &c. - As if he had
been no more, than a common soldier: he was exposed to the same kind of
death and reproach as they were.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 1:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">sa2 1:22</span></span>

Not back - Without effect: their arrows shot from their bow, and their
swords did seldom miss, and commonly pierced fat, and flesh, and blood,
and reached even to the heart and bowels. Returned not, &c. - But filled
and glutted with blood: for the sword is metaphorically said to have a
mouth, which we translate an edge; and to devour. And this their former
successfulness is mentioned as an aggravation of their last infelicity.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 1:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">sa2 1:23</span></span>

Lovely - Amiable, and obliging in their carriage and conversation, both
towards one another, and towards their people: for, as for Saul's fierce
behaviour towards Jonathan, it was only a sudden passion, by which his
ordinary temper was not to be measured; and for his carriage towards
David, that was from that jealousy and reason of state which usually
engageth even well - natured princes, to the same hostilities. But it is
observable, that David speaks not a word here of his piety; but only
commends him for those things which were truly in him. A fit pattern for
all preachers in their funeral commendations. Swifter, &c. - Expeditious
in pursuing their enemies, and executing their designs; which is a great
commendation in a prince, and in a soldier. Stronger, &c. - In regard of
their bodily strength, and the courage of their mind.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 1:24](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">sa2 1:24</span></span>

Daughters - These he mentions; because the women then used to make songs
both of triumph, and of lamentation, and, because they usually are most
delighted with the ornaments of the body here following. Clothed you -
This he did, because he procured them so much peace as gave them
opportunity of enriching themselves: and, because he took these things
as spoils from the enemies, and clothed his own people with them.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 1:25](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">sa2 1:25</span></span>

Thine - Which were in thy country, and (had not thy father disinherited
thee by his sins) in thy dominions.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 1:26](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">sa2 1:26</span></span>

Distressed - That is, for the loss of thee. For, besides the loss of a
true friend, which is inestimable; he lost him who both could, and
undoubtedly would have given him a speedy, and quiet, and sure
possession of the kingdom, whereas now, he met with long and troublesome
interruptions. Of women - That is, that love wherewith they love their
husbands, or children for their affections are usually more ardent than
mens.
