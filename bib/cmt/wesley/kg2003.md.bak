### [4 Kings (2 Kings) Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2003.htm#001.md)

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2003.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">kg2 3:3</span></span>

The sins - The worship of the calves: which all the kings of Israel kept
up as a wall of partition between their subjects and those of Judah. So
that altho' he had a little religion, yet he had not enough to over -
rule this policy.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2003.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">kg2 3:4</span></span>

A sheep - master - A man of great wealth (which in those times and
places consisted much in cattle) which enabled and emboldened him to
rebel against his sovereign.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2003.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">kg2 3:7</span></span>

He said - He joins with him in this war; because the war was just in
itself, and convenient for Jehoshaphat, both in the general, that
revolters should be chastised: lest the examples should pass into his
dominions, and the Edomites be encouraged to revolt from him, as they
did from his son; and in particular, that the Moabites should be
humbled, who had invaded his land before this time, [Ch2
20:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#001.md), and might do so again if they
were not brought low; for which a fair opportunity now offered.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2003.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">kg2 3:9</span></span>

King of Edom - That is, the vice - roy under Jehosaphat, [Kg1
22:47](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#047.md), here called king: because that
word is sometimes used for any prince or chief ruler. Seven days -
Because they made a great army, which could move but slowly; and they
fetched a greater compass than was usual, for some advantage which they
expected by it. No water - A frequent want in those parts; and now, it
seems, increased by the extraordinary heat and dryness of the season.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg2003.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">kg2 3:11</span></span>

Is there not, &c. - This he should have asked before, when they first
undertook the expedition, as he did in a like case, [Kg1
22:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#005.md), and for that neglect he now
suffers; but better late than never: his affliction brings him to the
remembrance of his former sin, and present duty. Poured water - Who was
his servant; this being one office of a servant: and this office was the
more necessary among the Israelites, because of the frequent washings
which their law required. Probably it was by a special direction from
God, that Elisha followed them, unasked, unobserved. Thus does God
prevent us with the blessings of his goodness; and provide for those who
provide not for themselves.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2003.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">kg2 3:12</span></span>

The word, &c. - He is a true prophet. Which Jehoshaphat might easily
understand, because being a good man, many would be ready to inform him
of. Went - To his tent; which was either in the camp, or not far from
it: they did not send for him, but went to him, that by giving him this
honour, they might engage him to give them his utmost assistance.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2003.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">kg2 3:13</span></span>

What have I, &c. - I desire to have no discourse with thee. Get thee -
To the calves, which thou after thy father's example dost worship; and
to the Baals which thy mother yet worshippeth by thy permission; let
these idols whom thou worshippest in thy prosperity, now help thee in
thy distress.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2003.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">kg2 3:14</span></span>

Jehoshaphat - Whom I reverence and love for his piety. It is good being
with those who have God's favour, and the love of his people. Wicked men
often fare the better, for the friendship and society of good men.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg2003.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">kg2 3:15</span></span>

Minstrel - One that can sing and play upon a musical instrument. This he
requires, that his mind which had been disturbed at the sight of wicked
Jehoram, might be composed, and that he might be excited to more fervent
prayer whereby he was prepared to receive the prophetic inspiration.
Those that desire communion with God must keep their spirits quiet and
serene. All hurry of spirit, and all turbulent passions, make us unfit
for divine visitations. The hand, &c. - The spirit of prophecy, so
called, to note that it was no natural nor acquired virtue inherent in
him; but a singular gift of God, given to whom and when he pleased.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg2003.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">kg2 3:19</span></span>

Ye shall smite - And if this command seem severe, it must be considered,
that the Moabites were a very wicked people, perfidious, cruel,
implacable enemies to God's people upon all occasions, and now in a
state of rebellion.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 3:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg2003.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">kg2 3:20</span></span>

The meal - offering - That is, the morning sacrifice: which doubtless
was attended with the solemn prayers of God's people. At this time
Elisha joined his prayers with the prayers of God's people, especially
those at Jerusalem. And this time God chose to answer their prayers, and
to work this miracle, that thereby he might determine the controversy
between the Israelites and the Jews, about the place and manner of
worship, and give a publick testimony from heaven for the Jews, and
against the Israelites. God that commands all the waters both above and
beneath the firmament, sent them abundance of water on a sudden.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 3:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg2003.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">kg2 3:21</span></span>

The border - Of their country, to defend the passage.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 3:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg2003.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">kg2 3:25</span></span>

Kir - haraseth - This was the royal city of the Moabites, into which the
remnant of the Moabites were gathered, where also their king was with
them. The stones - The walls and buildings of this city only were left;
their whole country being destroyed. The slingers - Such as slung great
stones against the walls to break them down, according to the manner of
those times. Made breaches in the walls, by which they might enter the
city, and take it.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 3:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg2003.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">kg2 3:26</span></span>

To break thro' - That he might make an escape: which he chose to do on
the king of Edom's quarter; because he thought his was the weakest side.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 3:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg2003.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">kg2 3:27</span></span>

His son - Or rather, his own son: whom he sacrificed; partly, to obtain
the favour of his god, according to the manner of the Phoenicians and
other people in publick calamities; and partly, to oblige the Israelites
to quit the siege out of compassion; or, as despairing to conquer (at
least without greater loss of men than it was worth) him who was
resolved to defend the city to the utmost extremity. On the wall - That
the besiegers might see it, and be moved by it. There was, &c. - Or,
great trouble or repentance upon Israel, the Israelitish king and people
(who was the first cause of the war, and had brought the rest into
confederacy with him) were greatly grieved for this barbarous action,
and resolved to prosecute the war no farther.
