thyself by giving thine hand, as the custom then was in such cases. With
- With the creditor, whom he calls a stranger, because the usurers in
Israel, who lent money to others, upon condition of paying use for it,
were either Heathens, or were reputed as bad as Heathens, because this
practice was forbidden by God's law, [Deu
