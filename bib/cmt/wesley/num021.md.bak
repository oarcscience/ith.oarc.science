### [Numbers Chapter 21](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#001.md)

[Numbers 21:1](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">num 21:1</span></span>

King Arad - Or rather, the Canaanite King of Arad: for Arad is not the
name of a man, but of a city or territory. And he seems to be called a
Canaanite in a general sense, as the Amorites and others. The south - Of
Canaan, towards the east, and near the dead sea. Of the spies - Not of
those spies which Moses sent to spy the land, for that was done thirty
eight years before this, and they went so privately, that the Canaanites
took no notice of them, nor knew which way they came or went; but of the
spies which he himself sent out to observe the marches and motions of
the Israelites. Took some of them prisoners - Which God permitted for
Israel's humiliation, and to teach them not to expect the conquest of
that land from their own wisdom or valour.

[Numbers 21:2](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">num 21:2</span></span>

I will utterly destroy them - I will reserve no person or thing for my
own use, but devote them all to total destruction.

[Numbers 21:3](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">num 21:3</span></span>

They utterly destroyed them - Neither Moses nor the whole body of the
people did this but a select number sent out to punish that king and
people, who were so fierce and malicious that they came out of their own
country to fight with the Israelites in the wilderness; and these, when
they had done this work, returned to their brethren into the wilderness.
But why did they not all now go into Canaan, and pursue this victory?
Because God would not permit it, there being several works yet to be
done, other people must be conquered, the Israelites must be farther
humbled and tried and purged, Moses must die, and then they shall enter,
and that in a more glorious manner, even over Jordan, which shall be
miraculously dried up, to give them passage. Hormah - That is, utter
destruction.

[Numbers 21:4](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">num 21:4</span></span>

By way of the Red - sea - Which leadeth to the Red - sea, as they must
needs do to compass the land of Edom. Because of the way - By reason of
this journey, which was long and troublesome, and unexpected, because
the successful entrance and victorious progress which some of them had
made in the borders of Canaan, made them think they might have speedily
gone in and taken possession of it, and so have saved the tedious
travels and farther difficulties, into which Moses had again brought
them.

[Numbers 21:5](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">num 21:5</span></span>

Against God - Against Christ, their chief conductor, whom they tempted,
[Co1 10:19](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#019.md). Thus contemptuously did
they speak of Manna, whereas it appears it yielded excellent
nourishment, because in the strength of it they were able to go so many
and such tedious journeys.

[Numbers 21:6](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">num 21:6</span></span>

Fiery serpents - There were many such in this wilderness, which having
been hitherto restrained by God, are now let loose and sent among them.
They are called fiery from their effects, because their poison caused an
intolerable heat and burning and thirst, which was aggravated with this
circumstance of the place, that here was no water, [Num
21:5](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#005.md).

[Numbers 21:8](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">num 21:8</span></span>

A fiery serpent - That is, the figure of a serpent in brass, which is of
a fiery colour. This would require some time: God would not speedily
take off the judgment, because he saw they were not throughly humbled.
Upon a pole - That the people might see it from all parts of the camp,
and therefore the pole must be high, and the serpent large. When he
looketh - This method of cure was prescribed, that it might appear to be
God's own work, and not the effect of nature or art: and that it might
be an eminent type of our salvation by Christ. The serpent signified
Christ, who was in the likeness of sinful flesh, though without sin, as
this brazen serpent had the outward shape, but not the inward poison, of
the other serpents: the pole resembled the cross upon which Christ was
lifted up for our salvation: and looking up to it designed our believing
in Christ.

[Numbers 21:9](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">num 21:9</span></span>

He lived - He was delivered from death, and cured of his disease.

[Numbers 21:10](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">num 21:10</span></span>

In Oboth - Not immediately, but after two other stations mentioned, [Num
33:43-44](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#043.md).

[Numbers 21:12](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">num 21:12</span></span>

The valley of Zared - Or rather, by the brook of Zared, which ran into
the dead sea.

[Numbers 21:13](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">num 21:13</span></span>

On the other side - Or rather, on this side of Arnon, for so it now was
to the Israelites, who had not yet passed over it. Between Moab and the
Amorites - Though formerly it and the land beyond it belonged to Moab,
yet afterwards it had been taken from them by Sihon. This is added to
reconcile two seemingly contrary commands of God, the one that of not
meddling with the land of the Moabites, [Deu
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#009.md), the other that of going over
Arnon and taking possession of the land beyond it, [Deu
2:24](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#024.md), because, saith he, it is not now
the land of the Moabites, but of the Amorites.

[Numbers 21:14](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">num 21:14</span></span>

The book of the wars of the Lord - This seems to have been some poem or
narration of the wars and victories of the Lord, either by: or relating
to the Israelites: which may be asserted without any prejudice to the
integrity of the holy scripture, because this book doth not appear to
have been written by a prophet, er to be designed for a part of the
canon, which yet Moses might quote, as St. Paul doth some of the heathen
poets. And as St. Luke assures us, that many did write an history of the
things done, and said by Christ, [Luk
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#001.md), whose writings were never
received as canonical, the like may be conceived concerning this and
some few other books mentioned in the old testament. The brooks - The
brook, the plural number for the singular, as the plural number rivers
is used concerning Jordan, [Psa 74:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#015.md),
and concerning Tigris, [Nah 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/nah002.htm#006.md), and
concerning Euphrates, [Psa 137:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa137.htm#001.md), all
which may be to called because of the several little streams into which
they were divided.

[Numbers 21:15](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">num 21:15</span></span>

Ar - A chief city in Moab.

[Numbers 21:16](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">num 21:16</span></span>

Beer - This place and Mattanah, Nahaliel, and Bamoth named here, [Num
21:19](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#019.md), are not mentioned among those
places where they pitched or encamped, Num. 33:1-49. Probably they did
not pitch or encamp in these places, but only pass by or through them. I
will give them water - In a miraculous manner. Before they prayed, God
granted, and prevented them with the blessings of goodness. And as the
brasen serpent was the figure of Christ, so is this well a figure of the
spirit, who is poured forth for our comfort, and from him flow rivers of
living waters.

[Numbers 21:17](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">num 21:17</span></span>

Spring up - Heb. ascend, that is, let thy waters, which now lie hid
below in the earth, ascend for our use. It is either a prediction that
it should spring up, or a prayer that it might.

[Numbers 21:18](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">num 21:18</span></span>

With their staves - Probably as Moses smote the rock with his rod, so
they struck the earth with their staves, as a sign that God would cause
the water to flow out of the earth where they smote it, as he did before
out of the rock. Perhaps they made holes with their staves in the sandy
ground, and God caused the water immediately to spring up.

[Numbers 21:20](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">num 21:20</span></span>

Pisgah - This was the top of those high hills of Abarim.

[Numbers 21:21](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">num 21:21</span></span>

Sent messengers - By God's allowance, that so Sihon's malice might be
the more evident and inexcusable, and their title to his country more
clear in the judgment of all men, as being gotten by a just war, into
which they were forced for their own defence.

[Numbers 21:22](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">num 21:22</span></span>

Let me pass - They spoke what they seriously intended and would have
done, if he had given them quiet passage.

[Numbers 21:24](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">num 21:24</span></span>

From Arnon - Or, which reached from Arnon; and so here is a description
or limitation of Sihon's conquest and kingdom, that is, extended only
from Arnon, unto the children of Ammon; and then the following words,
for the border of the children of Ammon was strong, come in very fitly,
not as a reason why the Israelites did not conquer the Ammonites, for
they were absolutely forbidden to meddle with them, [Deu
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#008.md), but as a reason why Sihon could
not enlarge his conquests to the Ammonites, as he had done to the
Moabites. Jabbok - A river by which the countries of Ammon and Moab were
in part bounded and divided. Strong - Either by the advantage of the
river, or by their strong holds in their frontiers.

[Numbers 21:26](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">num 21:26</span></span>

Was the city of Sihon - This is added as a reason why Israel took
possession of this land, because it was not now the land of the
Moabites, but in the possession of the Amorites. The former king - The
predecessor of Balak, who was the present king. See the wisdom of
providence, which prepares long before, for the accomplishing God's
purposes in their season! This country being designed for Israel, is
before - hand put into the hand of the Amorites, who little think they
have it but as trustees, till Israel comes of age. We understand not the
vast reaches of providence: but known unto God are all his works!

[Numbers 21:27](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">num 21:27</span></span>

In proverbs - The poets or other ingenious persons, of the Amorites or
Canaanites, who made this following song of triumph over the vanquished
Moabites: which is here brought in, as a proof that this was now Sihon's
land, and as an evidence of the just judgment of God in spoiling the
spoilers, and subduing those who insulted over their conquered enemies.
Come into Heshbon - These are the words either of Sihon speaking to his
people, or of the people exhorting one another to come and possess the
city which they had taken. Of Sihon - That which once was the royal city
of the king of Moab, but now is the city of Sihon.

[Numbers 21:28](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">num 21:28</span></span>

A fire - The fury of war, which is fitly compared to fire. Out of
Heshbon - That city which before was a refuge and defence to all the
country, now is turned into a great annoyance. It hath consumed Ar -
This may be understood not of the city Ar, but of the people or the
country subject or belonging to that great and royal city. The lords of
the high places - The princes or governors of the strong holds, which
were frequently in high places, especially in that mountainous country,
and which were in divers parts all along the river Arnon. So the
Amorites triumphed over the vanquished Moabites. But the triumphing of
the wicked is short!

[Numbers 21:29](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">num 21:29</span></span>

People of Chemosh - The worshippers of Chemosh: so the God of the
Moabites was called. He, that is, their God, hath delivered up his own
people to his and their enemies; nor could he secure even those that had
escaped the sword, but suffered them to be carried into captivity. The
words of this and the following verse seem to be not a part of that
triumphant song made, by some Amoritish poet, which seems to be
concluded, [Num 21:28](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#028.md), but of the
Israelites making their observation upon it. And here they scoff at the
impotency not only of the Moabites, but of their God also, who could not
save his people from the sword of Sihon and the Amorites.

[Numbers 21:30](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">num 21:30</span></span>

Though you feeble Moabites, and your God too, could not resist Sihon, we
Israelites, by the help of our God, have shot, with success and victory,
at them, at Sihon and his Amorites. Heshbon - The royal city of Sihon,
and by him lately repaired, Is perished - Is taken away from Sihon, and
so is all his country, even as far as Dibon.

[Numbers 21:32](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">num 21:32</span></span>

Jaazer - One of the cities of Moab formerly taken from them by Sihon,
and now taken from him by the Israelites.

[Numbers 21:33](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">num 21:33</span></span>

Og - Who also was a king of the Amorites. And it may seem that Sihon and
Og were the leaders or captains of two great colonies which came out of
Canaan, and drove out the former inhabitants of these places. Bashan - A
rich country, famous for its pastures and breed of cattle, and for its
oaks.
