### [4 Kings (2 Kings) Chapter 25](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#001.md)

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 25:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg2 25:1</span></span>

Came - To chastise Zedekiah for his rebellion and perjury. Built - To
keep all supplies of men or provisions from entering into the city: and
that from thence they might shoot darts, or arrows, or stones.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 25:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">kg2 25:3</span></span>

The people - For the common people, but only for the great men. Now they
eat their own children for want of food, [Lam
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#003.md), &c. Jeremiah in this extremity,
earnestly persuaded the king to surrender; but his heart was hardened to
his destruction.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 25:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">kg2 25:6</span></span>

Riblah - Where Nebuchadnezzar staid, that he might both supply the
besiegers with men, and military provisions, as their occasions
required; and have an eye to Chaldea, to prevent or suppress any
commotions which might happen there in his absence. They - The king's
officers appointed thereunto, examined his cause, and passed the
following sentence against him.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 25:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">kg2 25:7</span></span>

Slew, &c. - Tho' they were but children, that this spectacle, the last
he was to behold, might leave a remaining impression of grief and horror
upon his spirit. And in slaying his sons they in effect declared, that
the kingdom was no more, and that he nor any of his breed were fit to be
trusted: therefore not fit to live. Babylon - Thus two prophecies were
fulfilled, which seemed contrary one to the other, that he should go to
Babylon, [Jer 32:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#005.md), [Jer
34:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#003.md), and that he should never see
Babylon: which seeming contradiction, because Zedekiah the false prophet
could not reconcile, he concluded both were false, and it seems Zedekiah
the king might stumble at this difficulty.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 25:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">kg2 25:8</span></span>

Months, &c. - So the Chaldeans did not put all to fire and sword, as
soon as they had taken the city: but about a month after, orders were
sent, to compleat the destruction of it. This space God gave them to
repent after all the foregoing days of his patience. But in vain; they
still hardened their hearts: and therefore execution is awarded to the
utmost.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 25:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">kg2 25:9</span></span>

Burnt the house of the Lord - One of the apocryphal writers tells us,
that Jeremiah got the ark out of the temple, and conveyed it to a cave
in mount Nebo, 2 Macc. 2:4-5. But this is like the other tales of that
author, who has no regard either to truth or probability. For Jeremiah
was at this time a close prisoner. By the burning of the temple God
would shew, how little he cares for the outward pomp of his worship,
when the life and power of religion are gone. About four hundred and
thirty years the temple of Solomon had stood. And it is observed by
Josephus, that the second temple was burnt by the Romans, the same
month, and the same day of the month, that the first temple was burnt by
the Chaldeans.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 25:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">kg2 25:11</span></span>

People - Whom neither the sword nor famine had destroyed, who were eight
hundred and thirty two persons, [Jer
52:29](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#029.md), being members and traders of
that city: for it is likely, there were very many more of the country
people fled thither, who were left with others of their brethren to
manure the land. Multitude - Of the inhabitants of the country.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 25:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">kg2 25:12</span></span>

Left of the poor - So while the rich were prisoners in a strange land,
the poor had liberty and peace in their own country! Thus providence
sometimes humbles the proud, and favours them of low degree.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 25:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">kg2 25:21</span></span>

Out of the land - This compleated their calamity, about eight hundred
and sixty years after they were put in possession of it by Joshua.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 25:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">kg2 25:22</span></span>

Gedaliah - A righteous and good man, and a friend to the prophet
Jeremiah.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 25:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">kg2 25:24</span></span>

Sware - Assured them by his promise and oath, that they should be kept
from the evils which they feared. This he might safely swear, because he
had not only the king of Babylon's promise but also God's promise
deliver'd by Jeremiah. And it might seem, a fair prospect was opening
again. But how soon was the scene changed! This hopeful settlement is
quickly dashed in pieces, not by the Chaldeans, but by some of
themselves.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 25:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">kg2 25:25</span></span>

Came - Moved with envy to see so mean a person advanced into their
place. Ten men - Ten captains or officers, and under each of them many
soldiers.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 25:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">kg2 25:26</span></span>

Egypt - And here they probably mixt with the Egyptians by degrees, and
were heard of no more as Israelites.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 25:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">kg2 25:27</span></span>

Seven and twentieth - Or, on the twenty fifth day, as it is, [Jer
52:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#031.md). For then the decree was made,
which was executed upon the twenty seventh day.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 25:30](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">kg2 25:30</span></span>

All the days of his life - Let none say, they shall never see good
again, because they have long seen little but evil. The most afflicted
know not what blessed turn providence may yet give to their affairs.
