### [Ecclesiastes Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#001.md)

[Ecclesiastes 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ecc 4:1</span></span>

I returned - I considered again. Oppressions - Whether by princes,
magistrates, or other potent persons. No comforter - None afforded them
pity or succour. But they, &c. - No comfort therein.

[Ecclesiastes 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ecc 4:2</span></span>

I praised - I judged them less miserable. For this is certain, that
setting aside the future life, which Solomon doth not meddle with in the
present debate; and considering the uncertainty, and vanity, and
manifold calamities of the present life, a wise man would not account it
worth his while to live.

[Ecclesiastes 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ecc 4:3</span></span>

Better is he - Who was never born. Not seen - Not felt: for as seeing
good is put for enjoying it, so seeing evil is put for suffering it.

[Ecclesiastes 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ecc 4:4</span></span>

Right work - All the worthy designs of virtuous men. Envied - Instead of
honour, he meets with envy and obloquy.

[Ecclesiastes 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ecc 4:5</span></span>

The fool - Is careless and idle: perceiving that diligence is attended
with envy, he runs into the other extreme. Eateth - Wastes his
substance, and brings himself to poverty, whereby his very flesh pines
away for want of bread.

[Ecclesiastes 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ecc 4:6</span></span>

Better - These are the words of the sluggard, making this apology for
his idleness, That his little with ease, is better than great riches got
with much trouble.

[Ecclesiastes 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ecc 4:8</span></span>

Alone - Who has none but himself to care for. Brother - To whom he may
leave his vast estate. Yet - He lives in perpetual restlessness and
toil. For whom - Having no kindred to enjoy it. And bereave - Deny
myself those comforts and conveniences which God hath allowed me? A sore
travel - A dreadful judgment, as well as a great sin.

[Ecclesiastes 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ecc 4:9</span></span>

Two - Who live together in any kind of society. Because - Both have
great benefit by such conjunction, whereby they support, encourage, and
strengthen one another.

[Ecclesiastes 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ecc 4:10</span></span>

They - One of them. Fall - Into any mistake, or sin, or danger.

[Ecclesiastes 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">ecc 4:12</span></span>

Prevail - Against either of them.

[Ecclesiastes 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">ecc 4:13</span></span>

Better - More happy. Now he proceeds to another vanity, That of honour
and power. Than a king - Who hath neither wisdom to govern himself, nor
to receive the counsels of wiser men.

[Ecclesiastes 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ecc 4:14</span></span>

For he - The poor and wise child is often advanced to the highest
dignity. Whereas - That old king is deprived of his kingdom.

[Ecclesiastes 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">ecc 4:15</span></span>

I considered - The general disposition of common people, in all
kingdoms, that they are fickle and inconstant. With the second child -
This may be understood of the king's child, or son and heir, called
second, in respect of his father, whose successor he is. Stand up -
Arise to reign.

[Ecclesiastes 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">ecc 4:16</span></span>

No end - This humour of the common people hath no end, but passes from
one generation to another. Before them - Before the present generation.
And so here are three generations of people noted, the authors of the
present change, and their parents, and their children; and all are
observed to have the same inclinations. In him - They shall be as weary
of the successor, though a wise and worthy prince, as their parents were
of his foolish predecessor.
