<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#003">Psalms 9:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">psa 9:3</A></FONT></span></p>Turned back - Put to flight. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#007">Psalms 9:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">psa 9:7</A></FONT></span></p>But - Though cities and people may perish, yet the Lord abides for ever. Which is sufficient for the terror of his enemies, and the comfort of his church. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#010">Psalms 9:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">psa 9:10</A></FONT></span></p>Thy name - Thy infinite power and wisdom, and faithfulness and goodness. The name of God is frequently put for God. Put their trust - The experience of thy faithfulness to thy people in all ages, is a just ground for their confidence. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#011">Psalms 9:11</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_011">psa 9:11</A></FONT></span></p>Zion - Whose special and gracious presence is there. People - To the heathen nations. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#012">Psalms 9:12</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_012">psa 9:12</A></FONT></span></p>Blood - The bloodshed of his innocent and holy ones: which though he may not seem to regard for a season, yet he will certainly call the authors of it to a severe account. Them - The humble, as it follows, or the oppressed, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#009">Psa 9:9</A>, that trust in him, and seek to him, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#010">Psa 9:10</A>, whom he seemed to have forgotten. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#014">Psalms 9:14</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_014">psa 9:14</A></FONT></span></p>Gates - In the great assemblies. These gates he elegantly opposes to the former. Of - Of the people who live or meet together in Zion. For cities are as it were mothers to their people, and the people are commonly called their daughters. So the names of the daughters of Egypt, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#011">Jer 46:11</A>, and of Edom, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#021">Lam 4:21-22</A>, and of Tyre, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#012">Psa 45:12</A>, are put for the people of those places. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#016">Psalms 9:16</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_016">psa 9:16</A></FONT></span></p>Higgaion - This is either a musical term, or a note of attention, intimating that the matter deserves deep meditation, or consideration, as the word signifies. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#017">Psalms 9:17</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_017">psa 9:17</A></FONT></span></p>Forget - That do not regard God, nor his precepts, nor his threatenings and judgments.
