### [Zechariah Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#001.md)

[Zechariah 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">zac 1:1</span></span>

In the eighth month - Two months after Haggai began to encourage the
Jews to build the temple. Zechariah - Probably this is that Zechariah
whom the Jews slew between the temple and the altar, [Mat
23:35](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#035.md).

[Zechariah 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">zac 1:5</span></span>

Where are they - But where are your disobedient fathers? Were they not
consumed with famine and sword, as I threatened them? Do they live - The
prophets died as others; they must not live always to warn you.

[Zechariah 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">zac 1:6</span></span>

My words - The dreadful menaces which I spake. My statutes - The decreed
judgments which I resolved to execute on them, which by my prophets I
proclaimed. Take hold - Overtake as a pursuing enemy overtakes, and
seizeth on his enemy. They returned - By this it should seem that
Zechariah gave them time to consider what answer to give. So hath he
dealt - It is true, as God said he would do, so he hath done against us.

[Zechariah 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">zac 1:8</span></span>

A man - Christ Jesus in the shape of a man. Riding - In a posture of
readiness. A red horse - This colour is a symbol of his coming to avenge
himself on his enemies. The myrtle - trees - He posted himself in a
convenient place to observe and be ready, among verdant, fragrant trees,
emblems of the saints of God. In the bottom - This bottom or valley in
which the myrtles grew, is an emblem of the church in a low, afflicted
state. Behind him - Christ was, as becomes a captain, at the head, the
rest, as his soldiers, are behind attending on him. Red horses - Horses
and horsemen, and those are angels, [Zac
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#010.md). And the colour of these horses
is red, probably denoting the bloody condition of states and kingdoms,
by wars one against another when God punisheth his church, or when he
avengeth himself. Speckled - Of a mixt colour; perhaps an emblem of
affairs, not all dark, nor all light, such as those during the last
seventy prophetic weeks. White - An emblem of the best days of the
church.

[Zechariah 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">zac 1:9</span></span>

O my Lord - This was Christ, the Lord of hosts. What are these - What is
the meaning of these appearances. The angel - Christ, the angel of the
covenant.

[Zechariah 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">zac 1:10</span></span>

These - Horsemen, are angels, who are ministers of the Divine Providence
in the government of the world.

[Zechariah 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">zac 1:11</span></span>

Is at rest - All men sit still to take their ease. All is peaceable.
This was the state of the empire which at that time ruled all.

[Zechariah 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">zac 1:12</span></span>

Angel of the Lord - The angel, the Lord Christ.

[Zechariah 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">zac 1:14</span></span>

Cry thou - Now publish what thou hearest, and assure my poor captive
church, that God will do good for her.

[Zechariah 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">zac 1:15</span></span>

A little displeased - With mine own people, that is, in comparison of
the anger I bear against the Heathen. Helped forward - Attempted to
destroy whom I would but correct.

[Zechariah 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">zac 1:16</span></span>

A line - The builder's measuring line shall be stretched out, to mark
out the walls, gates, streets, and houses in Jerusalem.

[Zechariah 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">zac 1:17</span></span>

Through prosperity - Through increase of families, they shall send forth
colonies, and plant new cities, and thro' increase of wealth, and
cattle, be able to build their cities, and stock their colonies.

[Zechariah 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">zac 1:18</span></span>

Four horns - Emblems of the enemies of the Jews.

[Zechariah 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">zac 1:19</span></span>

The horns - Powers, states, and kingdoms, which have from all sides
pushed at, broken and tossed my people. Judah - The two tribes. Israel -
The ten tribes.

[Zechariah 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">zac 1:21</span></span>

He - Christ. These - He first points to the four horns. But these -
These carpenters are emblems of those instruments God will employ in
breaking those destroyers. Who lift up - Who employed their arms and
strength against the kingdom of Judah, to drive them out of God's
inheritance.
