### [Mark Chapter 12](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#001)

[Mark 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mar 12:1</span></span>

[Mat 21:43](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#043); [Luk
20:9](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#009).

[Mark 12:10](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">mar 12:10</span></span>

[Psa 118:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#022).

[Mark 12:12](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">mar 12:12</span></span>

They feared the multitude - How wonderful is the providence of God,
using all things for the good of his children! Generally the multitude
is restrained from tearing them in pieces only by the fear of their
rulers. And here the rulers themselves are restrained, through fear of
the multitude!

[Mark 12:13](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">mar 12:13</span></span>

[Mat 22:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#015); [Luk
20:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#020).

[Mark 12:17](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">mar 12:17</span></span>

They marvelled at him - At the wisdom of his answer.

[Mark 12:18](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">mar 12:18</span></span>

[Mat 21:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#023); [Luk
20:27](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#027).

[Mark 12:19](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">mar 12:19</span></span>

[Deu 25:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#005).

[Mark 12:25](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">mar 12:25</span></span>

When they rise from the dead, neither men marry nor women are given in
marriage.

[Mark 12:26](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">mar 12:26</span></span>

[Exo 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#006).

[Mark 12:27](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">mar 12:27</span></span>

He is not the God of the dead, but the God of the living - That is, (if
the argument be proposed at length,) since the character of his being
the God of any persons, plainly intimates a relation to them, not as
dead, but as living; and since he cannot be said to be at present their
God at all, if they are utterly dead; nor to be the God of human
persons, such as Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, consisting of souls and
bodies, if their bodies were to abide in everlasting death; there must
needs be a future state of blessedness, and a resurrection of the body
to share with the soul in it.

[Mark 12:28](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">mar 12:28</span></span>

Which is the first commandment? - The principal, and most necessary to
be observed. [Mat 22:34](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#034); [Luk
10:25](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#025).

[Mark 12:29](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">mar 12:29</span></span>

The Lord our God is one Lord - This is the foundation of the first
commandment, yea, of all the commandments. The Lord our God, the Lord,
the God of all men, is one God, essentially, though three persons. From
this unity of God it follows, that we owe all our love to him alone.
[Deu 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#004).

[Mark 12:30](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">mar 12:30</span></span>

With all thy strength - That is, the whole strength and capacity of thy
understanding, will, and affections.

[Mark 12:31](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">mar 12:31</span></span>

The second is like unto it - Of a like comprehensive nature: comprising
our whole duty to man. There is no other moral, much less ceremonial
commandment, greater than these. [Lev
19:18](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#018).

[Mark 12:33](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">mar 12:33</span></span>

To love him with all the heart - To love and serve him, with all the
united powers of the soul in their utmost vigour; and to love his
neighbour as himself - To maintain the same equitable and charitable
temper and behaviour toward all men, as we, in like circumstances, would
wish for from them toward ourselves, is a more necessary and important
duty, than the offering the most noble and costly sacrifices.

[Mark 12:34](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#034)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">mar 12:34</span></span>

Jesus said to him, Thou art not far from the kingdom of God - Reader,
art not thou? then go on: be a real Christian: else it had been better
for thee to have been afar off.

[Mark 12:35](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#035)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">mar 12:35</span></span>

[Mat 22:41](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#041); [Luk
20:41](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#041).

[Mark 12:36](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#036)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">mar 12:36</span></span>

[Psa 110:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#001).

[Mark 12:38](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#038)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">mar 12:38</span></span>

Beware of the scribes - There was an absolute necessity for these
repeated cautions. For, considering their inveterate prejudices against
Christ, it could never be supposed the common people would receive the
Gospel till these incorrigible blasphemers of it were brought to just
disgrace. Yet he delayed speaking in this manner till a little before
his passion, as knowing what effect it would quickly produce. Nor is
this any precedent for us: we are not invested with the same authority.
[Mat 23:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#005); [Luk
20:46](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#046).

[Mark 12:41](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#041)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">mar 12:41</span></span>

He beheld how people cast money into the treasury - This treasury
received the voluntary contributions of the worshippers who came up to
the feast; which were given to buy wood for the altar, and other
necessaries not provided for in any other way. [Luk
21:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#001).

[Mark 12:43](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#043)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_043">mar 12:43</span></span>

I say to you, that this poor widow hath cast in more than they all - See
what judgement is cast on the most specious, outward actions by the
Judge of all! And how acceptable to him is the smallest, which springs
from self - denying love!
