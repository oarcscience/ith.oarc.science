### [3 Kings (1 Kings) Chapter 8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#001)

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg1 8:1</span></span>

Elders - The senators, and judges, and rulers. Heads - For each tribe
had a peculiar governor. Chief - The chief persons of every great family
in each tribe. Jerusalem - Where the temple was built. Bring the ark -
To the top of Moriah, upon which it was built; whither they were now to
carry the ark in solemn pomp. City of David - Where David had placed the
ark, which is called Zion, because it was built upon that hill.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">kg1 8:2</span></span>

All Israel - Not only the chief men, but a vast number of the common
people. The feast - The feast of the dedication, to which Solomon had
invited them. Seventh month - Which time he chose with respect to his
peoples convenience, because now they had gathered in all their fruits,
and were come up to Jerusalem, to celebrate the feast of tabernacles.
But the temple was not finished till the eighth month, [Kg1
6:38](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#038), how then could he invite them in
the seventh month? This was the seventh month of the next year. For
although the house in all its parts was finished the year before, yet
the utensils of it were not then fully finished: and many preparations
were to be made for this great and extraordinary occasion.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">kg1 8:3</span></span>

The priests - For although the Levites might do this, [Num
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#015), yet the priests did it at this
time, for the greater honour of the solemnity; and because the Levites
might not enter into the holy - place, much less into the holy of
holies, where it was to be placed, into which the priests themselves
might not have entered, if the high - priest alone could have done it.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">kg1 8:4</span></span>

The tabernacle - That made by Moses, which doubtless before this time
had been translated from Gibeon to Zion, and now together with other
things, was put into the treasuries of the Lord's house, to prevent all
superstitious use of it, and to oblige the people to come up to
Jerusalem, as the only place where God would now be worshipped.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">kg1 8:5</span></span>

Sacrificing - When the ark was seated in its place: for although they
might in the way offer some sacrifices, as David did; yet that was not a
proper season to offer so many sacrifices as could not be numbered. This
is more particularly related below, [Kg1
8:62-64](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#062), which is here signified by
way of anticipation.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">kg1 8:6</span></span>

Cherubim - Of Solomon's new made cherubim, not of the Mosaic cherubim,
which were far less, and unmovably fixed to the ark, [Exo
37:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/exo037.htm#007), and therefore together with
the ark, were put under the wings of these cherubim.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">kg1 8:8</span></span>

Drew out - Not wholly, which was expressly forbidden, [Exo
25:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#015), [Num
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#006), but in part. Seen out - In the
most holy place, which is oft called by way of eminency, the holy place,
and the Hebrew words rendered before the oracle, may be as well
rendered, within the oracle. And these staves were left in this posture,
that the high - priest might hereby be certainly guided to that very
place where he, was one day in a year to sprinkle blood, and to offer
incense before the ark, which otherwise he might mistake in that dark
place, where the ark was wholly covered with the wings of the great
cherubim, which stood between him and the ark when he entered in.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">kg1 8:9</span></span>

Nothing - Strictly and properly: but in a more large sense, the pot of
manna, and Aaron's rod were also in it, [Heb
9:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#004), that is, by it, in the most holy
place, before the ark of the testimony, where God commanded Moses to put
them.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">kg1 8:10</span></span>

The cloud - The usual token of God's glorious presence. Filled - In
testimony of his gracious acceptance of this work, and their service;
and to beget an awe and reverence in them, and in all others, when they
approach to God.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">kg1 8:12</span></span>

Then spake - Perceiving both priests and people struck with wonder at
this darkness, he minds them, that this was no sign of God's disfavour,
as some might possibly imagine; but a token of his approbation, and
special presence among them. Said - He hath declared, that he would
manifest his presence with, and dwelling among his people, by a dark
cloud, in which he would appear.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">kg1 8:14</span></span>

Turned - From the temple to the body of the congregation. Stood - In
token of reverence, and of their readiness to receive the blessing.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">kg1 8:16</span></span>

Since, &c. - Until David's time; for then he did chuse Jerusalem. That
my name - That my presence, and grace, and worship, and glory, might be
there. Chose David - And in and with him the tribe of Judah, of which he
was, and Jerusalem where he dwelt.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">kg1 8:21</span></span>

The covenant - The tables of the covenant, wherein the conditions of
God's covenant with Israel are written.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">kg1 8:22</span></span>

Stood - Upon a scaffold set up for him in the court of the people, [Ch2
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2006.htm#013).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">kg1 8:24</span></span>

Hast kept - That branch of thy promise concerning the building of this
house by David's son.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">kg1 8:25</span></span>

Keep - Make good the other branch of thy promise.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">kg1 8:27</span></span>

But will - Is it possible that the great, and high, and lofty God should
stoop so low, as to take up his dwelling amongst men? The heaven - All
this vast space of the visible heaven. And heaven, &c. - The third and
highest, and therefore the largest heaven, called the heaven of heavens
for its eminency and comprehensiveness. Contain - For thy essence
reacheth far beyond them, being omnipresent. Much less - This house
therefore was not built as if it were proportionable to thy greatness,
or could contain thee, but only that therein we might serve and glorify
thee.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">kg1 8:28</span></span>

Yet - Tho' thou art not comprehended within this place, yet shew thyself
to be graciously present here, by accepting and granting my present
requests here tendered unto thee.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">kg1 8:29</span></span>

Open - To behold with an eye of favour. My name - My presence, and glory
and grace. This place - This temple, to which Solomon did now look, and
towards which, the godly Israelites directed their looks in their
prayers.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:30](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">kg1 8:30</span></span>

In heaven - Which he adds to direct them in their addresses to God in
this temple, to lift up their eyes above it, even to heaven, where God's
most true, and most glorious dwelling - place is. Forgive - The sins of
thy people, praying, and even of their prayers; which, if not pardoned,
will certainly hinder the success of all their prayers, and the course
of all thy blessings.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:31](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">kg1 8:31</span></span>

Trespass - If he be accused of a trespass. Laid on him - Either by the
judge, or by the party accusing him, or by the accused person himself:
which was usual, when there were no witnesses. Thine altar - For here
God, who was appealed to as witness, was especially present. Hence the
Heathens used to swear at their altars.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:32](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">kg1 8:32</span></span>

His way - The just recompence of his wicked action. Give him, &c. - To
vindicate him, and manifest his integrity.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:33](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">kg1 8:33</span></span>

Confess - Give glory to thy name, by acknowledging their sins, and by
justice; and by accepting the punishment of their iniquity; and by
trusting to thy power and goodness alone, for their deliverance.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:35](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#035)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">kg1 8:35</span></span>

Heaven - The lower heaven in which the clouds are. Shut up - Heaven is
compared to a great store - house in God's keeping, out of which nothing
can be had, so long as it is close shut up.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:36](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#036)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">kg1 8:36</span></span>

Good way - The way, of their duty, which is good in itself; and both
delightful and profitable, to those that walk in it. Give rain - The
order of Solomon's prayer is very observable; first and chiefly, he
prays for their repentance and forgiveness, which is the chief blessing,
and the only solid foundation of all other mercies: and then he prays
for temporal mercies; thereby teaching us what to desire principally in
our prayers; which also Christ hath taught us in his perfect prayer;
wherein there is but one petition for outward, and all the rest are for
spiritual blessings.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:38](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#038)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">kg1 8:38</span></span>

The plague - His sin, which may be called the plague of his heart, in
opposition to the other plagues here mentioned; so the sense is, who, by
their afflictions are brought to a true and serious sense of their worse
and inward plague of their sins, which are most fitly called the plague
of the heart, because that is both the principal seat of sin, and the
fountain from whence all actual sins flow.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:39](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#039)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">kg1 8:39</span></span>

Thou knowest - Not only the plagues of their hearts, their several wants
and burdens, (these he knows! but he will know them from us,) but the
desire and intent of the heart, the sincerity or hypocrisy of it.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:41](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#041)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">kg1 8:41</span></span>

A stranger - A proselyte. But cometh - That he may worship, and glorify
thy name.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:43](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#043)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_043">kg1 8:43</span></span>

Calleth for - Agreeable to thy will and word. It is observable, that his
prayer for the strangers is more large, and comprehensive, than for the
Israelites; that thereby he might both shew his public - spiritedness,
and encourage strangers to the worship of the true God. Thus early were
the indications of God's favour, toward the sinners of the Gentiles. As
there was then one law for the native and for the stranger, so there was
one gospel for both.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:44](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#044)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_044">kg1 8:44</span></span>

To battle - In a just cause, and by thy warrant or commission. Shall
pray - Whereby he instructs them, that they should not trust, either to
the strength or justice of their arms, but only to God's help and
blessing. Chosen - For thy dwelling - place, and the seat of thy temple.
Towards the house - For to it they were to turn their faces in prayer;
to profess themselves worshippers of the true God, in opposition to
idols; and to strengthen their faith in God's promises and covenant, the
tables whereof were contained in that house. Soldiers in the field must
not think it enough that others pray for them: they must pray for
themselves. And they are here encouraged to expect a gracious answer.
Praying should always go along with fighting.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:48](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#048)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_048">kg1 8:48</span></span>

And return - Sincerely, universally, and steadfastly.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:49](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#049)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_049">kg1 8:49</span></span>

Their course - Heb. their right, against their invaders and oppressors.
For they had forfeited all their rights to God only, but not to their
enemies; whom tho' God used as scourges to chastise his peoples sins,
yet they had no pretence of right to their land.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:55](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#055)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_055">kg1 8:55</span></span>

He stood - He spoke this standing, that he might be the better heard,
and because he blessed as one having authority. Never were words more
pertinently spoken: never was a congregation dismissed, with that which
was more likely to affect them, and to abide with them.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:56](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#056)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_056">kg1 8:56</span></span>

Blessed, &c. - This discharge he gives in the name of all Israel, to the
everlasting honour of the Divine faithfulness, and the everlasting
encouragement of all those that build upon the Divine promises.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:58](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#058)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_058">kg1 8:58</span></span>

Incline - That he may not only bless us with outward prosperity, but
especially, with spiritual blessings: and that as he hath given us his
word to teach and direct us, so he would by his holy Spirit, effectually
incline us to obey it.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:61](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#061)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_061">kg1 8:61</span></span>

Perfect - Let your obedience be universal, without dividing; upright,
without dissembling; and constant, without declining.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:63](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#063)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_063">kg1 8:63</span></span>

Offered - Not all in one day, but in the seven, or it may be in the
fourteen days, mentioned [Kg1 8:65](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#065).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:64](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#064)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_064">kg1 8:64</span></span>

Middle of the court - Of the priests court, in which the great altar
was. This he consecrated as he did the great altar, by sacrifices; but
with this difference, that he consecrated that for perpetual use: but
this only for the present occasion, being warranted to do so both by the
necessity of it for God's service, and for the present solemn work, for
which the brazen altar was not sufficient; and by the direction of God's
spirit, wherewith Solomon was endowed, as being a prophet, as well as a
king. Here therefore he suddenly reared up divers altars, which, after
this solemnity were demolished.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:65](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#065)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_065">kg1 8:65</span></span>

Seven - Seven for the dedication of the temple, or altar; and the other
seven for the feast of tabernacles. And it seems to be expressed in this
manner, to intimate, that these fourteen days of rejoicing, were not
altogether, but that there was some interval between them, which indeed
was necessary, because the day of atonement was on the tenth day of this
month, [Lev 23:27](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#027). And because these
fourteen days ended on the twenty - second day, [Ch2
7:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2007.htm#010), it may seem most probable, that
the feast of the dedication was kept before the tenth day: and the feast
of tabernacles some days after it.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:66](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#066)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_066">kg1 8:66</span></span>

He sent - Solomon having joined with the people in the solemn assembly,
which was kept on the eighth day; in the close of that day took his
solemn farewell, and dismissed them with his blessing; and the next
morning when the heads and elders with divers of the people came to take
their leave of the king, he sent them away.
