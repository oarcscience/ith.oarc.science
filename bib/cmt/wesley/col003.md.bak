### [Colossians Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#001.md)

[Colossians 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">col 3:1</span></span>

If ye are risen, seek the things above - As Christ being risen,
immediately went to heaven.

[Colossians 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">col 3:3</span></span>

For ye are dead - To the things on earth. And your real, spiritual life
is hid from the world, and laid up in God, with Christ - Who hath
merited, promised, prepared it for us, and gives us the earnest and
foretaste of it in our hearts.

[Colossians 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">col 3:4</span></span>

When Christ - The abruptness of the sentence surrounds us with sudden
light. Our life - The fountain of holiness and glory. Shall appear - In
the clouds of heaven.

[Colossians 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">col 3:5</span></span>

Mortify therefore - Put to death, slay with a continued stroke. Your
members - Which together make up the body of sin. Which are upon the
earth - Where they find their nourishment. Uncleanness - In act, word,
or thought. Inordinate affection - Every passion which does not flow
from and lead to the love of God. Evil desire - The desire of the flesh,
the desire of the eye, and the pride of life. Covetousness - According
to the derivation of the word, means the desire of having more, or of
any thing independent on God. Which is idolatry - Properly and directly;
for it is giving the heart to a creature.

[Colossians 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">col 3:6</span></span>

For which - Though the heathens lightly regarded them.

[Colossians 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">col 3:7</span></span>

Living denotes the inward principle; walking, the outward acts.

[Colossians 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">col 3:8</span></span>

Wrath - Is lasting anger. Filthy discourse - And was there need to warn
even these saints of God against so gross and palpable a sin as this? O
what is man, till perfect love casts out both fear and sin.

[Colossians 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">col 3:10</span></span>

In knowledge - The knowledge of God, his will, his word.

[Colossians 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">col 3:11</span></span>

Where - In which case, it matters not what a man is externally, whether
Jew or gentile, circumcised, or uncircumcised, barbarian, void of all
the advantages of education, yea, Scythian, of all barbarians most
barbarous. But Christ is in all that are thus renewed, and is all things
in them and to them.

[Colossians 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">col 3:12</span></span>

All who are thus renewed are elected of God, holy, and therefore the
more beloved of him. Holiness is the consequence of their election, and
God's superior love, of their holiness.

[Colossians 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">col 3:13</span></span>

Forbearing one another - If anything is now wrong. And forgiving one
another - What is past.

[Colossians 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">col 3:14</span></span>

The love of God contains the whole of Christian perfection, and connects
all the parts of it together.

[Colossians 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">col 3:15</span></span>

And then the peace of God shall rule in your hearts - Shall sway every
temper, affection, thought, as the reward (so the Greek word implies) of
your preceding love and obedience.

[Colossians 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">col 3:16</span></span>

Let the word of Christ - So the apostle calls the whole scripture, and
thereby asserts the divinity of his Master. Dwell - Not make a short
stay, or an occasional visit, but take up its stated residence. Richly -
In the largest measure, and with the greatest efficacy; so as to fill
and govern the whole soul.

[Colossians 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">col 3:17</span></span>

In the name - In the power and Spirit of the Lord Jesus. Giving thanks
unto God - The Holy Ghost. And the Father through him - Christ.

[Colossians 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">col 3:18</span></span>

Wives, submit - Or be subject to. It is properly a military term,
alluding to that entire submission that soldiers pay to their general.
[Eph 5:22](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#022.md), &c.

[Colossians 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">col 3:19</span></span>

Be not bitter - (Which may be without any appearance of anger) either in
word or spirit.

[Colossians 3:21](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">col 3:21</span></span>

Lest they be discouraged - Which may occasion their turning either
desperate or stupid.

[Colossians 3:22](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">col 3:22</span></span>

Eyeservice - Being more diligent under their eye than at other times.
Singleness of heart - A simple intention of doing right, without looking
any farther. Fearing God - That is, acting from this principle.

[Colossians 3:23](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">col 3:23</span></span>

Heartily - Cheerfully, diligently. Menpleasers are soon dejected and
made angry: the single - hearted are never displeased or disappointed;
because they have another aim, which the good or evil treatment of those
they serve cannot disappoint.
