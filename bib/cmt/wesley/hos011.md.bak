### [Hosea Chapter 11](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#001.md)

[Hosea 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">hos 11:1</span></span>

Was a child - In the infancy of Israel. I loved him - Manifested my
tender and paternal affection to him. Called my son - Adopted him to be
my son, and as my son, provided for him, and brought him out of
servitude. Out of Egypt - But Israel, the first adopted son was a type
of Christ the first - born. And the history of Israel's coming out was a
type of Christ's future coming out of Egypt.

[Hosea 11:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">hos 11:2</span></span>

They - Moses and Aaron, and other prophets. Called - Persuaded,
intreated, and urged by exhortations, the whole house of Israel. From
them - From the prophets counsel and commands. Baalim - In the desert
they began this apostacy, and held on with obstinacy in it.

[Hosea 11:3](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">hos 11:3</span></span>

I taught - As a mother or nurse helps the child. Taking them -
Supporting and bearing them up. They knew not - They would not see nor
acknowledge me in it.

[Hosea 11:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">hos 11:4</span></span>

Cords of man - With such kindness as best fits and most prevails with a
man. I was to them - As a careful husband - man in due season takes the
yoke from his labouring oxen, and takes off the muzzle with which they
were kept from eating, when at work. I laid meat unto them - Brought
them provision in their wants.

[Hosea 11:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">hos 11:5</span></span>

He - Ephraim. Shall be king - Shall rule them with rigour and cruelty.
They refused - The reason of all is, their obstinacy in idolatry.

[Hosea 11:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">hos 11:6</span></span>

His branches - The lesser towns and villages. Their own counsels - Which
they have followed in opposition to all the good counsels the prophets
gave them from time to time.

[Hosea 11:7](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">hos 11:7</span></span>

They - The prophets. None at all - Scarce any one would hearken and
obey.

[Hosea 11:8](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">hos 11:8</span></span>

Give thee up - To utter destruction. Admah and Zeboim were two of the
four cities which were destroyed with fire from heaven. My repentings -
Not that God is ever fluctuating or unresolved; but these are
expressions after the manner of men, to shew what severity Israel had
deserved, and yet how divine grace would be glorified in sparing them.

[Hosea 11:9](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">hos 11:9</span></span>

Return - Conquerors that plunder the conquered city, carry away the
wealth of it, and after some time return to burn it; God will not do so.
Not man - Therefore my compassions fail not. The holy One - A holy God,
and in covenant, though not with all, yet with many among you. Enter
into the city - Utterly to destroy thee, as I did Sodom.

[Hosea 11:10](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">hos 11:10</span></span>

They - The remnant shall hear and obey the Lord. Like a lion - The word
of the Lord, so saith the Chaldee, shall roar as a lion. Christ is
called, The lion of the tribe of Judah: and when he cried with a loud
voice, it was as when a lion roared. The voice of the gospel was heard
far, as the roaring of a lion; and it was a mighty voice. Tremble - The
spirit by its power awakening them to a sight of sin, shall make them
fear and tremble. From the west - From the ends of the earth.

[Hosea 11:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">hos 11:11</span></span>

They shall tremble - At their return into their own land, some shall
hasten, yet with solicitude, out of Egypt, whither they fled for
shelter; others like doves shall hasten out of Assyria, but with fear
and trembling. I will place them - A seasonable and comfortable promise.

[Hosea 11:12](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">hos 11:12</span></span>

Ephraim - Most of the people of Israel. With lies - Play the hypocrite
with me still. Judah - The two tribes. Yet ruleth - While idolaters are
slaves to the devil, the true worshippers of God, like princes, rule
with God. Faithful - Retains purity, at least truth of worship, and
comparatively is faithful. Judah adheres to God's holy prophets,
priests, and other saints of God.
