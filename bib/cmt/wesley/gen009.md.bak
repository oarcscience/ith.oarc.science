### [Genesis Chapter 9](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#001.md)

[Genesis 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">gen 9:1</span></span>

And God blessed Noah and his sons - He assured them of his good - will
to them, and his gracious intentions concerning them. The first blessing
is here renewed, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and
repeated, [Gen 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#007.md); for the race of
mankind was as it were to begin again. By virtue of this blessing
mankind was to be both multiplied and perpetuated upon earth; so that in
a little time all the habitable parts of the earth should be more or
less inhabited; and tho' one generation should pass away, yet another
generation should come, so that the stream of the human race should be
supplied with a constant succession, and run parallel with the current
of time, 'till both be swallowed up in the ocean of eternity.

[Genesis 9:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">gen 9:2</span></span>

He grants them power over the inferior creatures. He grants, 1. A title
to them; into your hands they are delivered - For your use and benefit.
2. A dominion over them, without which the title would avail little; The
fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast - This
revives a former grant, [Gen 1:28](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#028.md),
only with this difference, that man in innocency ruled by love, fallen
man rules by fear. And thus far we have still the benefit of it, 1. That
those creatures which are any way useful to us are reclaimed, and we use
them either for service or food, or both, as they are capable. 2. Those
creatures that are any way hurtful to us are restrained; so that tho'
now and then man may be hurt by some of them, yet they do not combine
together to rise up in rebellion against man.

[Genesis 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">gen 9:3</span></span>

Every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you - Hitherto man had
been confined to feed only upon the products of the earth, fruits, herbs
and roots, and all sorts of corn and milk; so was the first grant, [Gen
1:29](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#029.md). But the flood having perhaps
washed away much of the virtue of the earth, and so rendered its fruits
less pleasing, and less nourishing, God now enlarged the grant, and
allowed man to eat flesh, which perhaps man himself never thought of
'till now. The precepts and provisos of this charter are no less kind
and gracious, and instances of God's good - will to man. The Jewish
doctors speak so often of the seven precepts of Noah, or of the sons of
Noah, which they say were to be observed by all nations, that it may not
be amiss to set them down. The first against the worship of idols. The
second against blasphemy, and requiring to bless the name of God. The
third against murder. The fourth against incest and all uncleanness. The
fifth against theft and rapine. The sixth requiring the administration
of justice. The seventh against eating flesh with the life. These the
Jews required the observation of, from the proselytes of the gate. But
the precepts here given, all concern the life of man. Man must not
prejudice his own life by eating that food which is unwholsome, and
prejudicial to his health.

[Genesis 9:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">gen 9:4</span></span>

But flesh with the life thereof, which is the blood thereof, shall ye
not eat - Blood made atonement for the soul, [Lev
17:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev017.htm#011.md). The life of the sacrifice was
accepted for the life of the sinner. Blood must not be looked upon as a
common thing, but must be poured out before the Lord, [Sa2
23:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#016.md). Mr. Henry indeed has a strange
conceit, That this is only a prohibition to eat flesh. This does such
apparent violence to the text, that to mention it, is sufficient.

[Genesis 9:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">gen 9:5</span></span>

And surely your blood of your lives will I require - Our own lives are
not so our own, that we may quit them at our own pleasure; but they are
God's, and we must resign them at his pleasure. If we any way hasten our
own deaths, we are accountable to God for it. Yea, At the hand of every
beast will I require it - To shew how tender God was of the life of man,
he will have the beast put to death that kills a man. This was confirmed
by the law of Moses, [Exo 21:28](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#028.md), and
it would not be unsafe to observe it still. And at the hand of every
man's brother will I require the life of a man - I will avenge the blood
of the murdered upon the murderer. When God requires the life of a man
at the hand of him that took it away unjustly, he cannot render that,
and therefore must render his own in lieu of it, which is the only way
left of making restitution.

[Genesis 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">gen 9:6</span></span>

Whoso sheddeth man's blood - Whether upon a sudden provocation, or
premeditated, (for rash anger is heart - murder as well as malice
prepense, [Mat 5:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#021).md), by man shall
his blood be shed - That is, by the magistrate, or whoever is appointed
to be the avenger of blood. Before the flood, as it should seem by the
story of Cain, God took the punishment of murder into his own hands; but
now he committed this judgment to men, to masters of families at first,
and afterwards to the heads of countries. For in the image of God made
he man - Man is a creature dear to his Creator, and therefore ought to
be so to us; God put honour upon him, let us not then put contempt upon
him. Such remains of God's image are still even upon fallen man, that he
who unjustly kills a man, defaceth the image of God, and doth dishonour
to him.

[Genesis 9:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">gen 9:9</span></span>

We have here the general establishment of God's covenant with this new
world, and the extent of that covenant.

[Genesis 9:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">gen 9:11</span></span>

There shall not any more be a flood - God had drowned the world once,
and still it is as provoking as ever; yet he will never drown it any
more, for he deals not with us according to our sins. This promise of
God keeps the sea and clouds in their decreed place, and sets them gates
and bars, Hitherto they shall come, [Job
38:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#010.md). If the sea should flow but
for a few days, as it doth twice every day for a few hours, what
desolations would it make? So would the clouds, if such showers as we
have sometimes seen, were continued long. But God by flowing seas, and
sweeping rains, shews what he could do in wrath; and yet by preserving
the earth from being deluged between both, shews what he can do in
mercy, and will do in truth.

[Genesis 9:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">gen 9:13</span></span>

I set my bow in the clouds - The rainbow, 'tis likely was seen in the
clouds before, but was never a seal of the covenant 'till now. Now,
concerning this seal of the covenant, observe, This seal is affixed with
repeated assurances of the truth of that promise, which it was designed
to be the ratification of; I do set my bow in the cloud, [Gen
9:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#013.md). It shall be seen in the cloud,
[Gen 9:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#014.md). and it shall be a token of
the covenant, [Gen 9:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#012.md). And I will
remember my covenant, that the waters shall no more become a flood, [Gen
9:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#015.md). Nay, as if the eternal Mind
needed a memorandum, I will look upon it that I may remember the
everlasting covenant, [Gen 9:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#016.md). The
rainbow appears when the clouds are most disposed to wet; when we have
most reason to fear the rain prevailing, God shews this seal of the
promise that it shall not prevail. The rainbow appears when one part of
the sky is clear, which imitates mercy remembered in the midst of wrath,
and the clouds are hemmed as it were with the rainbow, that it may not
overspread the heavens, for the bow is coloured rain, or the edges of a
cloud gilded. As God looks upon the bow that he may remember the
covenant, so should we, that we also may be ever mindful of the covenant
with faith and thankfulness.

[Genesis 9:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">gen 9:20</span></span>

And Noah began to be an husbandman - Heb. a man of the earth, a man
dealing in the earth, that kept ground in his hand and occupied it.
Sometime after his departure out of the ark he returned to his old
employment, from which he had been diverted by the building of the ark
first, and probably after by the building an house for himself and
family. And he planted a vineyard - And when he had gathered his
vintage, probably he appointed a day of mirth and feasting in his
family, and had his sons and their children with him, to rejoice with
him in the increase of his house, as well as in the increase of his
vineyard; and we may suppose he prefaced his feast with a sacrifice to
the honour of God. If that was omitted, 'twas just with God to leave him
to himself, to end with the beasts that did not begin with God: but we
charitably hope he did. And perhaps he appointed this feast with design
in the close of it to bless his sons, as Isaac, [Gen
27:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#003.md). That I may eat, and that my
soul may bless thee.

[Genesis 9:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">gen 9:21</span></span>

And he drank of the wine and was drunk - 'Tis highly probable, he did
not know the effect of it before. And he was uncovered in his tent -
Made naked to his shame.

[Genesis 9:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">gen 9:22</span></span>

And Ham saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brethren - To
have seen it accidentally and involuntarily would not have been a crime.
But he pleased himself with the sight. And he told his two brethren
without - In the street, as the word is, in a scornful deriding manner.

[Genesis 9:23](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">gen 9:23</span></span>

And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and went backward, and covered the
nakedness of their father - They not only would not see it themselves,
but provided that no one else might see it; herein setting an example of
charity, with reference to other men's sin and shame.

[Genesis 9:25](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">gen 9:25</span></span>

A servant of servants - That is, the meanest and most despicable servant
shall he be, even to his brethren. Those who by birth were his equals,
should by conquest be his lords. This certainly points at the victories
obtained by Israel over the Canaanites, by which they were all either
put to the sword, or put under tribute. [Jos
9:23](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#023.md); [Jdg
1:28](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#028.md), [Jdg
1:30](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#030.md), [Jdg
1:33](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#033.md), [Jdg
1:35](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#035.md), which happened not 'till about
eight hundred years after this. God often visits the iniquity of the
fathers upon the children, especially when the children inherit the
fathers wicked dispositions, and imitate the father's wicked practices.

[Genesis 9:26](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">gen 9:26</span></span>

The God of Shem - All blessings are included in this. This was the
blessing conferred on Abraham and his seed, the God of heaven was not
ashamed to be called their God, [Heb
11:16](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#016.md). Shem is sufficiently
recompensed for his respect to his father by this, that the Lord himself
puts this honour upon him to be his God; which is a sufficient
recompense for all our services and all our sufferings for his name.

[Genesis 9:27](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">gen 9:27</span></span>

God shall enlarge Japheth, and he shall dwell in the tents of Shem - His
seed shall be so numerous and so victorious, that they shall be masters
of the tents of Shem, which was fulfilled when the people of the Jews,
the most eminent of Shem's race, were tributaries to the Grecians first,
and after to the Romans, both of Japhet's seed. This also speaks the
conversion of the Gentiles, and the bringing of them into the church;
and then we should read it, God shall persuade Japheth; (for so the word
signifies) and being so persuaded, he shall dwell in the tents of Shem -
That is, Jews and Gentiles shall be united together in the gospel -
fold: after many of the Gentiles shall have been proselyted to the
Jewish religion, both shall be one in Christ, [Eph
2:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#014.md). When Japheth joins with Shem,
Canaan falls before them both: when strangers become friends, enemies
become servants.
