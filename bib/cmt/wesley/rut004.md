### [Ruth Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#001.md)

[Ruth 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">rut 4:2</span></span>

Ten men - To be witnesses: for though two or three witnesses were
sufficient, yet in weightier matters they used more. And ten was the
usual number among the Jews, in causes of matrimony and divorce, and
translation of inheritances; who were both judges of the causes, and
witnesses of the fact.

[Ruth 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">rut 4:3</span></span>

Naomi - Both Naomi and Ruth had an interest in this land during their
lives, but he mentions only Naomi, because all was done by her
direction; lest the mention of Ruth should raise a suspicion of the
necessity of his marrying Ruth, before he had given his answer to the
first proposition.

[Ruth 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">rut 4:5</span></span>

Buy it - According to the law, [Deu
25:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#005.md). To raise, &c - To revive his
name, which was buried with his body, by raising up a seed to him, to be
called by his name.

[Ruth 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">rut 4:6</span></span>

Mar - Either because having no children of his own, he might have one,
and but one son by Ruth, who, though he should carry away his
inheritance, yet would not bear his name, but the name of Ruth's
husband; and so by preserving another man's name, he should lose his
own. Or, because as his inheritance would be but very little increased
by this marriage, so it might be much diminished by being divided
amongst his many children, which he possibly had already, and might
probably have more by Ruth. My right - Which I freely resign to thee.

[Ruth 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">rut 4:7</span></span>

All things - That is, in all alienation of lands. So that it is no
wonder if this ceremony differ a little from that, [Deu
25:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#009.md), because that concerned only one
case, but this is more general. Besides, he pleads not the command of
God, but only ancient custom, for this practice. Gave it - He who
relinquished his right to another, plucked off his own shoe and gave it
to him. This was symbolical, and a significant and convenient ceremony,
as if he said, take this shoe wherewith I used to go and tread upon my
land, and in that shoe do thou enter upon it, and take possession of it.
This was a testimony - This was admitted for sufficient evidence in all
such cases.

[Ruth 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">rut 4:10</span></span>

From the gate - That is, from among the inhabitants dwelling within the
gate of this city, which was Bethlehem - judah.

[Ruth 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">rut 4:11</span></span>

Rachel and Leah - Amiable and fruitful. These two are singled out,
because they were of a foreign original, and yet ingrafted into God's
people, as Ruth was; and because of that fertility which God vouchsafed
unto them above their predecessors, Sarah and Rebecca. Rachel is placed
before Leah, because she was his most lawful, and best - beloved wife.
Did build - That is, increase the posterity. Ephratah and Bethlehem -
Two names of one and the same place.

[Ruth 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">rut 4:12</span></span>

Pharez - As honourable and numerous as his family was; whom, though be
also was born of a stranger, God so blessed, that his family was one of
the five families to which all the tribe of Judah belonged, and the
progenitor of the inhabitants of this city.

[Ruth 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">rut 4:13</span></span>

Took Ruth - Which he might do, though she was a Moabite, because the
prohibition against marrying such, is to be restrained to those who
continue Heathens; whereas Ruth was a sincere proselyte and convert to
the God of Israel. Thus he that forsakes all for Christ, shall find more
than all with him.

[Ruth 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">rut 4:14</span></span>

Which hath not, &c. - The words may be rendered, Which hath not made, or
suffered thy kinsman to fail thee; that is, to refuse the performances
of his duty to thee and thine, as the other kinsman did. Famous - Heb.
and his name shall be famous in Israel, for this noble and worthy
action.

[Ruth 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">rut 4:15</span></span>

Thy life - That is, of the comfort of thy life. Born him - Or, hath born
to him; that is, to thy kinsman a son. Better than seven sons - See how
God sometimes makes up the want of those relations from whom we expected
most comfort, in those from whom we expected least! The bonds of love
prove stronger than those of nature.

[Ruth 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">rut 4:17</span></span>

A name - That is, they gave her advice about his name; for otherwise
they had no power or right to do so. Obed - A servant, to thee, to
nourish, and comfort, and assist thee; which duty childrren owe to their
progenitors.
