### [James Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#001.md)

[James 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jam 2:1</span></span>

My brethren - The equality of Christians, intimated by this name, is the
ground of the admonition. Hold not the faith of our common Lord, the
Lord of glory - Of which glory all who believe in him partake. With
respect of persons - That is, honour none merely for being rich; despise
none merely for being poor.

[James 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jam 2:2</span></span>

With gold rings - Which were not then so common as now.

[James 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jam 2:3</span></span>

Ye look upon him - With respect.

[James 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jam 2:4</span></span>

Ye distinguish not - To which the most respect is due, to the poor or to
the rich. But are become evil - reasoning judges - You reason ill, and
so judge wrong: for fine apparel is no proof of worth in him that wears
it.

[James 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jam 2:5</span></span>

Hearken - As if he had said, Stay, consider, ye that judge thus. Does
not the presumption lie rather in favour of the poor man? Hath not God
chosen the poor - That is, are not they whom God hath chosen, generally
speaking, poor in this world? who yet are rich in faith, and heirs of
the kingdom - Consequently, the most honourable of men: and those whom
God so highly honours, ought not ye to honour likewise?

[James 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jam 2:6</span></span>

Do not the rich often oppress you - By open violence; often drag you -
Under colour of law.

[James 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jam 2:7</span></span>

Do not they blaspheme that worthy name - Of God and of Christ. The
apostle speaks chiefly of rich heathens: but are Christians, so called,
a whit behind them?

[James 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jam 2:8</span></span>

If ye fulfil the royal law - The supreme law of the great King which is
love; and that to every man, poor as well as rich, ye do well. [Lev
19:18](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#018.md).

[James 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jam 2:9</span></span>

Being convicted - By that very law. [Exo
23:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#003.md).

[James 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jam 2:10</span></span>

Whosoever keepeth the whole law, except in one point, he is guilty of
all - Is as liable to condemnation as if he had offended in every point.

[James 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jam 2:11</span></span>

For it is the same authority which establishes every commandment.

[James 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jam 2:12</span></span>

So speak and act - In all things. As they that shall be judged - Without
respect of persons. By the law of liberty - The gospel; the law of
universal love, which alone is perfect freedom. For their transgressions
of this, both in word and deed, the wicked shall be condemned; and
according to their works, done in obedience to this, the righteous will
be rewarded.

[James 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jam 2:13</span></span>

Judgment without mercy shall be to him - In that day. Who hath showed no
mercy - To his poor brethren. But the mercy of God to believers,
answering to that which they have shown, will then glory over judgment.

[James 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jam 2:14</span></span>

From [Jam 1:22](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#022.md), the apostle has been
enforcing Christian practice. He now applies to those who neglect this,
under the pretence of faith. St. Paul had taught that "a man is
justified by faith without the works of the law." This some began
already to wrest to their own destruction. Wherefore St. James,
purposely repeating ([Jam 2:21](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#021.md), [Jam
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#023.md), [Jam
2:25](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#025).md) the same phrases, testimonies,
and examples, which St. Paul had used, [Rom
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#003.md), [Heb
11:17](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#017.md), [Heb
11:31](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#031.md), refutes not the doctrine of St.
Paul, but the error of those who abused it. There is, therefore, no
contradiction between the apostles: they both delivered the truth of
God, but in a different manner, as having to do with different kinds of
men. On another occasion St. James himself pleaded the cause of faith,
[Act 15:13-21](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#013.md); and St. Paul himself
strenuously pleads for works, particularly in his latter epistles. This
verse is a summary of what follows. What profiteth it? is enlarged on,
[Jam 2:15-17](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#015.md); though a man say, [Jam
2:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#018.md) can that faith save him? [Jam
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#020.md).

It is not, though he have faith; but, though he say he have faith. Here,
therefore, true, living faith is meant: but in other parts of the
argument the apostle speaks of a dead, imaginary faith. He does not,
therefore, teach that true faith can, but that it cannot, subsist
without works: nor does he oppose faith to works; but that empty name of
faith, to real faith working by love. Can that faith "which is without
works" save him? No more than it can profit his neighbour.

[James 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jam 2:17</span></span>

So likewise that faith which hath not works is a mere dead, empty
notion; of no more profit to him that hath it, than the bidding the
naked be clothed is to him.

[James 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jam 2:18</span></span>

But one - Who judges better. Will say - To such a vain talker. Show me,
if thou canst, thy faith without thy works.

[James 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">jam 2:19</span></span>

Thou believest there is one God - I allow this: but this proves only
that thou hast the same faith with the devils. Nay, they not only
believe, but tremble - At the dreadful expectation of eternal torments.
So far is that faith from either justifying or saving them that have it.

[James 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">jam 2:20</span></span>

But art than willing to know - Indeed thou art not: thou wouldest fain
be ignorant of it. O empty man - Empty of all goodness. That the faith
which is without works is dead - And so is not properly faith, as a dead
carcase is not a man.

[James 2:21](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">jam 2:21</span></span>

Was not Abraham justified by works - St. Paul says he was justified by
faith, [Rom 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#002.md), &c.: yet St. James
does not contradict him; for he does not speak of the same
justification. St. Paul speaks of that which Abraham received many years
before Isaac was born, [Gen 15:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#006.md). St.
James, of that which he did not receive till he had offered up Isaac on
the altar. He was justified, therefore, in St. Paul's sense, (that is,
accounted righteous,) by faith, antecedent to his works. He was
justified in St. James's sense, (that is, made righteous,) by works,
consequent to his faith. So that St. James's justification by works is
the fruit of St Paul's justification by faith.

[James 2:22](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">jam 2:22</span></span>

Thou seest that faith - For by faith Abraham offered him, [Heb
11:17](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#017.md). Wrought together with his works
- Therefore faith has one energy and operation; works, another: and the
energy and operation of faith are before works, and together with them.
Works do not give life to faith, but faith begets works, and then is
perfected by them. And by works was faith made perfect - Here St. James
fixes the sense wherein he uses the word justified; so that no shadow of
contradiction remains between his assertion and St. Paul's. Abraham
returned from that sacrifice perfected in faith, and far higher in the
favour of God. Faith hath not its being from works, (for it is before
them,) but its perfection. That vigour of faith which begets works is
then excited and increased thereby, as the natural heat of the body
begets motion, whereby itself is then excited and increased. See [Jo1
3:22](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#022.md).

[James 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">jam 2:23</span></span>

And the scripture - Which was afterwards written. Was hereby eminently
fulfilled, Abraham believed God, and it was imputed to him for
righteousness - This was twice fulfilled, - when Abraham first believed,
and when he offered up Isaac. St. Paul speaks of the former fulfilling;
St. James, of the latter. And he was called the Friend of God - Both by
his posterity, [Ch2 20:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#007.md); and by God
himself, [Isa 41:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#008.md) so pleasing to God
were the works be wrought in faith. [Gen
15:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#006.md)

[James 2:24](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">jam 2:24</span></span>

Ye see then that a man is justified by works, and not by faith only -
St. Paul, on the other band, declares, "A man is justified by faith,"
and not by works, [Rom 3:28](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#028.md). And yet
there is no contradiction between the apostles: because, They do not
speak of the same faith: St. Paul speaking of living faith; St. James
here, of dead faith. They do not speak of the same works: St. Paul
speaking of works antecedent to faith; St. James, of works subsequent to
it.

[James 2:25](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">jam 2:25</span></span>

After Abraham, the father of the Jews, the apostle cites Rahab, a woman,
and a sinner of the gentiles; to show, that in every nation and sex true
faith produces works, and is perfected by them; that is, by the grace of
God working in the believer, while he is showing his faith by his works.
