------------------------------------------------------------------------

### [Nehemiah Chapter 6](../../../bib/kjv/neh006.htm#001)

[Nehemiah 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/neh006.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">neh 6:1</span></span>

The doors - Not all of them.

[Nehemiah 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/neh006.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">neh 6:2</span></span>

Meet - To consult about the common service of our master the king of
Persia, or to make a friendly accommodation.

[Nehemiah 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/neh006.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">neh 6:4</span></span>

Four times, &c. - We must never be overcome by the greatest importunity,
to do anything ill or imprudent: but when we are attacked with the same
temptation, still resist it with the same reason and resolution.

[Nehemiah 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/neh006.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">neh 6:5</span></span>

Open letter - As speaking of a thing commonly known.

[Nehemiah 6:7](../../../bib/kjv/neh006.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">neh 6:7</span></span>

A king - We have now a king of our nation. Counsel - That we may
impartially examine the matter, that thy innocency may be cleared.

[Nehemiah 6:9](../../../bib/kjv/neh006.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">neh 6:9</span></span>

Strengthen my hands - A good prayer, when we are entering on any
particular services or conflicts in our Christian warfare.

[Nehemiah 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/neh006.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">neh 6:10</span></span>

Shut up - In his chamber adjoining to the temple, upon pretence of
singular devotion, and communion with God, and withal upon pretence of
certain knowledge, by the Spirit of God concerning their approaching
danger, from which thy could be safe nowhere but in the temple. For if
Nehemiah had done this, the people would have left their work, and every
one have shifted for his own safety.

[Nehemiah 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/neh006.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">neh 6:11</span></span>

As I - I the chief governor, upon whose presence, the very life of the
whole city and nation in a great measure depends: I who have professed
such resolution, and courage, and confidence in God. I, who have had
such eminent experience of God's assistance, of his calling me to this
employment, and carrying me through it when our danger was greater than
now it is. Shall I now dishonour God and religion, and betray the people
and city of God by my cowardice? Go in - Tho' his life depended upon it.

[Nehemiah 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/neh006.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">neh 6:13</span></span>

And sin - By going into a place forbidden to me, and that in such a
manner, which would have been both sinful and shameful. Reproach - As a
coward, and conscious of my own guilt, that they might make me
contemptible and odious both to my own people, and to the king of
Persia.

[Nehemiah 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/neh006.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">neh 6:14</span></span>

My God, &c. - This prayer we are not to imitate.

[Nehemiah 6:15](../../../bib/kjv/neh006.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">neh 6:15</span></span>

Elul - Answering part to our August, and part to September.
