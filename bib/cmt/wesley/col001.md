------------------------------------------------------------------------

### [Colossians Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#001)

[Colossians 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">col 1:2</span></span>

The saints - This word expresses their union with God. And brethren -
This, their union with their fellow - Christians.

[Colossians 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">col 1:3</span></span>

We give thanks - There is a near resemblance between this epistle, and
those to the Ephesians and Philippians.

[Colossians 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">col 1:5</span></span>

Ye heard before - I wrote to you. In the word of truth, of the gospel -
The true gospel preached to you.

[Colossians 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">col 1:6</span></span>

It bringeth forth fruit in all the world - That is, in every place where
it is preached. Ye knew the grace of God in truth - Truly experienced
the gracious power of God.

[Colossians 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">col 1:7</span></span>

The fellowservant - Of Paul and Timotheus.

[Colossians 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">col 1:8</span></span>

Your love in the Spirit - Your love wrought in you by the Spirit.

[Colossians 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">col 1:9</span></span>

We pray for you - This was mentioned in general, [Col
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#003), but now more particularly. That
ye may be filled with the knowledge of his will - Of his revealed will.
In all wisdom - With all the wisdom from above. And spiritual
understanding - To discern by that light whatever agrees with, or
differs from, his will.

[Colossians 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">col 1:10</span></span>

That, knowing his whole will, ye may walk worthy of the Lord, unto all
pleasing - So as actually to please him in all things; daily increasing
in the living, experimental knowledge of God, our Father, Saviour,
Sanctifier.

[Colossians 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">col 1:11</span></span>

Strengthened unto all patience and longsuffering with joyfulness - This
is the highest point: not only to know, to do, to suffer, the whole will
of God; but to suffer it to the end, not barely with patience, but with
thankful joy.

[Colossians 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">col 1:12</span></span>

Who, by justifying and sanctifying us, hath made us meet for glory.

[Colossians 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">col 1:13</span></span>

Power detains reluctant captives, a kingdom cherishes willing subjects.
His beloved Son - This is treated of in [Col
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#015) and following verses.

[Colossians 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">col 1:14</span></span>

In whom we have redemption - This is treated of from the middle of [Col
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#018). The voluntary passion of our
Lord appeased the Father's wrath, obtained pardon and acceptance for us,
and, consequently, dissolved the dominion and power which Satan had over
us through our sins. So that forgiveness is the beginning of redemption,
as the resurrection is the completion of it.

[Colossians 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">col 1:15</span></span>

Who is - By describing the glory of Christ, and his pre - eminence over
the highest angels, the apostle here lays a foundation for the reproof
of all worshippers of angels. The image of the invisible God - Whom none
can represent, but his only begotten Son; in his divine nature the
invisible image, in his human the visible image, of the Father. The
first begotten of every creature - That is, begotten before every
creature; subsisting before all worlds, before all time, from all
eternity.

[Colossians 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">col 1:16</span></span>

For - This explains the latter part of the preceding verse. Through
implies something prior to the particles by and for; so denoting the
beginning, the progress, and the end. Him - This word, frequently
repeated, signifies his supreme majesty, and excludes every creature.
Were created all things that are in heaven - And heaven itself. But the
inhabitants are named, because more noble than the house. Invisible -
The several species of which are subjoined. Thrones are superior to
dominions; principalities, to powers. Perhaps the two latter may express
their office with regard to other creatures: the two former may refer to
God, who maketh them his chariots, and, as it were, rideth upon their
wings.

[Colossians 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">col 1:17</span></span>

And he is before all things - It is not said, he was: he is from
everlasting to everlasting. And by him all things consist - The original
expression not only implies, that he sustains all things in being, but
more directly, All things were and are compacted in him into one system.
He is the cement, as well as support, of the universe. And is he less
than the supreme God?

[Colossians 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">col 1:18</span></span>

And - From the whole he now descends to the most eminent part, the
church. He is the head of the church - Universal; the supreme and only
head both of influence and of government to the whole body of believers.
Who is - The repetition of the expression [Col
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#015) points out the entrance on a new
paragraph. The beginning - Absolutely, the Eternal. The first begotten
from the dead - From whose resurrection flows all the life, spiritual
and eternal, of all his brethren. That in all things - Whether of nature
or grace. He might have the pre - eminence - Who can sound this depth?

[Colossians 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">col 1:19</span></span>

For it pleased the Father that all fulness - All the fulness of God.
Should dwell in him - Constantly, as in a temple; and always ready for
our approach to him.

[Colossians 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">col 1:20</span></span>

Through the blood of the cross - The blood shed thereon. Whether things
on earth - Here the enmity began: therefore this is mentioned first. Or
things in heaven - Those who are now in paradise; the saints who died
before Christ came.

[Colossians 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">col 1:21</span></span>

And you that were alienated, and enemies - Actual alienation of
affection makes habitual enmity. In your mind - Both your understanding
and your affections. By wicked works - Which continually feed and
increase inward alienation from, and enmity to, God. He hath now
reconciled - From the moment ye believed.

[Colossians 1:22](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">col 1:22</span></span>

By the body of his flesh - So distinguished from his body, the church.
The body here denotes his entire manhood. Through death - Whereby he
purchased the reconciliation which we receive by faith. To present you -
The very end of that reconciliation. Holy - Toward God. Spotless - In
yourselves. Unreprovable - As to your neighbour.

[Colossians 1:23](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">col 1:23</span></span>

If ye continue in the faith - Otherwise, ye will lose all the blessings
which ye have already begun to enjoy. And be not removed from the hope
of the gospel - The glorious hope of perfect love. Which is preached -
Is already begun to be preached to every creature under heaven.

[Colossians 1:24](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">col 1:24</span></span>

Now I rejoice in my sufferings for you, and fill up - That is, whereby I
fill up. That which is behind of the sufferings of Christ - That which
remains to be suffered by his members. These are termed the sufferings
of Christ, Because the suffering of any member is the suffering of the
whole; and of the head especially, which supplies strength, spirits,
sense, and motion to all. Because they are for his sake, for the
testimony of his truth. And these also are necessary for the church; not
to reconcile it to God, or satisfy for sin, (for that Christ did
perfectly,) but for example to others, perfecting of the saints, and
increasing their reward.

[Colossians 1:25](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">col 1:25</span></span>

According to the dispensation of God which is given me - Or, the
stewardship with which I am intrusted.

[Colossians 1:26](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">col 1:26</span></span>

The mystery - Namely, Christ both justifying and sanctifying gentiles,
as well as Jews. Which hath been comparatively hid from former ages and
past generations of men.

[Colossians 1:27](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">col 1:27</span></span>

Christ dwelling and reigning in you, The hope of glory - The ground of
your hope.

[Colossians 1:28](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">col 1:28</span></span>

We teach the ignorant, and admonish them that are already taught.
