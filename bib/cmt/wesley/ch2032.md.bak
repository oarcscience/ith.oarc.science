### [2 Chronicles Chapter 32](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#001.md)

[2 Chronicles 32:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch2 32:1</span></span>

After, &c. - An emphatical preface, signifying, that notwithstanding all
his zeal for God, God saw fit to exercise him with a sore trial. And God
ordered it at this time, that he might have an opportunity of shewing
himself strong, on the behalf of his returning people. It is possible,
we may be in the way of our duty, and yet meet with trouble and danger.
God permits this, for the trial of our confidence in him, and the
manifestation of his care over us.

[2 Chronicles 32:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ch2 32:3</span></span>

To stop - And withal to draw the waters by secret pipes underground to
Jerusalem.

[2 Chronicles 32:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">ch2 32:21</span></span>

The Lord sent an angel - The Jewish comment says the word of the Lord
sent Gabriel to do this execution, and that it done with lightning, and
in the passover night, the same night wherein the first - born in Egypt
were slain.

[2 Chronicles 32:25](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">ch2 32:25</span></span>

Lifted up - For that prodigious victory over the Assyrians, for his
miraculous restoration from sickness, and for the honour since done him
by an embassy from the great king of Babylon. All which probably raised
in him too great an opinion of himself, as if these things were done for
his piety and virtues.

[2 Chronicles 32:29](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">ch2 32:29</span></span>

Provided - He repaired, fortified, and beautified them for the honour
and safety of his kingdom.

[2 Chronicles 32:30](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">ch2 32:30</span></span>

Stopped, &c. - A rivulet near Jerusalem consisting of two streams, the
upper which was brought into one pool, called the upper pool, [Isa
7:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#003.md), and the lower which was brought
into another, called the lower pool, [Isa
22:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#009.md). The former he diverted and
brought by pipes into Jerusalem, which was a work of great art and
labour.

[2 Chronicles 32:31](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">ch2 32:31</span></span>

Wonder that was done - Either the destruction of the Assyrians, or the
going back of the sun. These miracles were wrought to alarm and awaken a
stupid, careless world, and to turn them from dumb and lame idols to the
living God. God left him - To himself, and suffered Satan to try him;
that he might know he had infirmities and sins as well as virtues. O
what need have great men, and good men, and useful men, to study their
own follies and infirmities, and to beg earnestly of God, that he would
hide pride from them!

[2 Chronicles 32:33](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">ch2 32:33</span></span>

Did him honour - It is a debt we owe to those who have been eminently
useful, to do them honour at their death, when they are out of the reach
of flattery, and we have seen the end of their conversation.
