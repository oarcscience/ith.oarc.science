### [Acts Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#001.md)

[Acts 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">act 7:2</span></span>

And he said - St. Stephen had been accused of blasphemy against Moses,
and even against God; and of speaking against the temple and the law,
threatening that Jesus would destroy the one, and change the other. In
answer to this accusation, rehearsing as it were the articles of his
historical creed, he speaks of God with high reverence, and a grateful
sense of a long series of Acts of goodness to the Israelites, and of
Moses with great respect, on account of his important and honourable
employments under God: of the temple with regard, as being built to the
honour of God; yet not with such superstition as the Jews; putting them
in mind, that no temple could comprehend God. And he was going on, no
doubt, when he was interrupted by their clamour, to speak to the last
point, the destruction of the temple, and the change of the law by
Christ. Men, brethren, and fathers, hearken - The sum of his discourse
is this: I acknowledge the glory of God revealed to the fathers, [Act
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#002.md), the calling of Moses, [Act
7:34](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#034.md) &c; the dignity of the law, [Act
7:8](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#008.md), [Act
7:38](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#038.md), [Act
7:44](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#044.md); the holiness of this place, [Act
7:7](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#007.md), [Act
7:45](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#045.md), [Act
7:47](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#047.md). And indeed the law is more
ancient than the temple; the promise more ancient than the law. For God
showed himself the God of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their children
freely, [Act 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#002.md), &c; [Act
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#009.md), &c; [Act
7:17](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#017.md), &c; [Act
7:32](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#032.md), [Act
7:34-35](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#034.md) and they showed faith and
obedience to God, [Act 7:4](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#004.md), [Act
7:20](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#020.md), &c; [Act
7:23](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#023.md) particularly by their regard for
the law, [Act 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#008.md) and the promised
land, [Act 7:16](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#016.md). Meantime, God never
confined his presence to this one place or to the observers of the law.
For he hath been acceptably worshipped before the law was given, or the
temple built, and out of this land, [Act
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#002.md), [Act
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#009.md), [Act
7:33](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#033.md), [Act
7:44](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#044.md). And that our fathers and their
posterity were not tied down to this land, their various sojournings,
[Act 7:4](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#004.md), &c; [Act
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#014.md), [Act
7:29](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#029.md), [Act
7:44](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#044.md) and exile, [Act
7:43](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#043.md), show. But you and your fathers
have always been evil, [Act 7:9](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#009.md) have
withstood Moses, [Act 7:25](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#025.md), &c; [Act
7:39](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#039.md), &c; have despised the land, [Act
7:39](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#039.md), forsaken God, [Act
7:40](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#040.md), &c, superstitiously honoured the
temple, [Act 7:48](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#048.md), resisted God and
his Spirit, [Act 7:50](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#050.md), killed the
prophets and the Messiah himself, [Act
7:51](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#051.md), and kept not the law for which
ye contend, [Act 7:53](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#053.md). Therefore God
is not bound to you; much less to you alone. And truly this solemn
testimony of Stephen is most worthy of his character, as a man full of
the Holy Ghost, and of faith and power: in which, though he does not
advance so many regular propositions, contradictory to those of his
adversaries, yet he closely and nervously answers them all. Nor can we
doubt but he would, from these premises, have drawn inferences touching
the destruction of the temple, the abrogation of the Mosaic law, the
punishment of that rebellious people; and above all, touching Jesus of
Nazareth, the true Messiah, had not his discourse been interrupted by
the clamours of the multitude, stopping their ears, and rushing upon
him. Men, brethren, and fathers - All who are here present, whether ye
are my equals in years, or of more advanced age. The word which in this
and in many other places is rendered men is a mere expletive. The God of
glory - The glorious God, appeared to Abraham before he dwelt in Haran -
Therefore Abraham knew God, long before he was in this land. [Gen
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#001.md).

[Acts 7:3](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">act 7:3</span></span>

Which I will show thee - Abraham knew not where he went.

[Acts 7:4](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">act 7:4</span></span>

After his father was dead - While Terah lived, Abraham lived partly with
him, partly in Canaan: but after he died, altogether in Canaan.

[Acts 7:5](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">act 7:5</span></span>

No, not to set his foot on - For the field mentioned, [Act
7:16](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#016.md), he did not receive by a Divine
donation, but bought it; even thereby showing that he was a stranger in
the land.

[Acts 7:6](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">act 7:6</span></span>

[Gen 15:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#013.md).

[Acts 7:7](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">act 7:7</span></span>

They shall serve me - Not the Egyptians.

[Acts 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">act 7:8</span></span>

And so he begat Isaac - After the covenant was given, of which
circumcision was the seal. [Gen 17:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#010.md).

[Acts 7:9](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">act 7:9</span></span>

But God was with him - Though he was not in this land. [Gen
37:28](../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#028.md).

[Acts 7:12](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">act 7:12</span></span>

Sent our fathers first - Without Benjamin.

[Acts 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">act 7:14</span></span>

Seventy - five souls - So the seventy interpreters, (whom St. Stephen
follows,) one son and a grandson of Manasseh, and three children of
Ephraim, being added to the seventy persons mentioned [Gen
46:27](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#027.md).

[Acts 7:16](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">act 7:16</span></span>

And were carried over to Shechem - It seems that St. Stephen, rapidly
running over so many circumstances of history, has not leisure (nor was
it needful where they were so well known) to recite them all distinctly.
Therefore he here contracts into one, two different sepulchres, places,
and purchases, so as in the former history, to name the buyer, omitting
the seller, in the latter, to name the seller, omitting the buyer.
Abraham bought a burying place of the children of Heth, Gen. 23:1-20.
There Jacob was buried. Jacob bought a field of the children of Hamor.
There Joseph was buried. You see here, how St. Stephen contracts these
two purchases into one. This concise manner of speaking, strange as it
seems to us, was common among the Hebrews; particularly, when in a case
notoriously known, the speaker mentioned but part of the story, and left
the rest, which would have interrupted the current of his discourse, to
be supplied in the mind of the hearer. And laid in the sepulchre that
Abraham bought - The first land which these strangers bought was for a
sepulchre. They sought for a country in heaven. Perhaps the whole
sentence might be rendered thus: So Jacob went down into Egypt and died,
he and our fathers, and were carried over to Shechem, and laid by the
sons (that is, decendants) of Hamor, the father of Shechem, in the
sepulchre that Abraham bought for a sum of money.

[Acts 7:18](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">act 7:18</span></span>

Another king - Probably of another family.

[Acts 7:19](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">act 7:19</span></span>

Exposed - Cast out to perish by hunger or wild beasts.

[Acts 7:20](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">act 7:20</span></span>

In which time - A sad but a seasonable time. [Exo
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#002.md).

[Acts 7:21](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">act 7:21</span></span>

Pharaoh's daughter took him up - By which means, being designed for a
kingdom, he had all those advantages of education, which he could not
have had, if he had not been exposed.

[Acts 7:22](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">act 7:22</span></span>

In all the wisdom of the Egyptians - Which was then celebrated in all
the world, and for many ages after. And mighty in words - Deep, solid,
weighty, though not of a ready utterance.

[Acts 7:23](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">act 7:23</span></span>

It came into his heart - Probably by an impulse from God.

[Acts 7:24](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">act 7:24</span></span>

Seeing one wronged - Probably by one of the task masters.

[Acts 7:25](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">act 7:25</span></span>

They understood it not - Such was their stupidity and sloth; which made
him afterward unwilling to go to them.

[Acts 7:26](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">act 7:26</span></span>

He showed himself - Of his own accord, unexpectedly.

[Acts 7:27](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">act 7:27</span></span>

Who appointed thee - "Under the presence of the want of a call by man,
the instruments of God are often rejected."

[Acts 7:30](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">act 7:30</span></span>

The angel - The Son of God; as appears from his styling himself Jehovah.
In a flame of fire - Signifying the majesty of God then present. [Exo
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#002.md).

[Acts 7:33](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">act 7:33</span></span>

Then said the Lord, Loose thy shoes - An ancient token of reverence; for
the place is holy ground - The holiness of places depends on the
peculiar presence of God there.

[Acts 7:35](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">act 7:35</span></span>

This Moses whom they refused - Namely, forty years before. Probably, not
they, but their fathers did it, and God imputes it to them. So God
frequently imputes the sins of the fathers to those of their children
who are of the same spirit. Him did God send to be a deliverer - Which
is much more than a judge; by the hand of - That is, by means of the
angel - This angel who spoke to Moses on Mount Sinai expressly called
himself Jehovah, a name which cannot, without the highest presumption,
be assumed by any created angel, since he whose name alone is Jehovah,
is the Most High over all the earth, [Psa
83:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#018.md). It was therefore the Son of God
who delivered the law to Moses, under the character of Jehovah, and who
is here spoken of as the angel of the covenant, in respect of his
mediatorial office.

[Acts 7:37](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">act 7:37</span></span>

The Lord will raise you up a prophet - St. Stephen here shows that there
is no opposition between Moses and Christ. [Deu
18:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#015.md)

[Acts 7:38](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#038.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">act 7:38</span></span>

This is he - Moses. With the angel, and with our fathers - As a mediator
between them. Who received the living oracles - Every period beginning
with, And the Lord said unto Moses, is properly an oracle. But the
oracles here intended are chiefly the ten commandments. These are termed
living, because all the word of God, applied by his Spirit, is living
and powerful, [Heb 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#012.md), enlightening
the eyes, rejoicing the heart, converting the soul, raising the dead.
[Exo 19:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#003.md).

[Acts 7:40](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#040.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">act 7:40</span></span>

Make us gods to go before us - Back into Egypt. [Exo
32:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#001.md).

[Acts 7:41](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#041.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">act 7:41</span></span>

And they made a calf - In imitation of Apis, the Egyptian god: and
rejoiced in the works of their hands - In the god they had made.

[Acts 7:42](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#042.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">act 7:42</span></span>

God turned - From them in anger; and gave them up - Frequently from the
time of the golden calf, to the time of Amos, and afterward. The host of
heaven - The stars are called an army or host, because of their number,
order, and powerful influence. In the book of the prophets - Of the
twelve prophets, which the Jews always wrote together in one book. Have
ye offered - The passage of Amos referred to, [Amo
5:25](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#025.md), consists of two parts; of which
the former confirms [Act 7:41](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#041.md), of the
sin of the people; the latter the beginning of [Act
7:42](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#042.md), concerning their punishment.
Have ye offered to me - They had offered many sacrifices; but God did
not accept them as offered to him, because they sacrificed to idols
also; and did not sacrifice to him with an upright heart. [Amo
5:25](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#025.md).

[Acts 7:43](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#043.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_043">act 7:43</span></span>

Ye took up - Probably not long after the golden calf: but secretly; else
Moses would have mentioned it. The shrine - A small, portable chapel, in
which was the image of their god. Moloch was the planet Mars, which they
worshipped under a human shape. Remphan, that is, Saturn, they
represented by a star. And I will carry you beyond Babylon - That is,
beyond Damascus (which is the word in Amos) and Babylon. This was
fulfilled by the king of Assyria, [Kg2
17:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#006.md).

[Acts 7:44](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#044.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_044">act 7:44</span></span>

Our fathers had the tabernacle of the testimony - The testimony was
properly the two tables of stone, on which the ten commandments were
written. Hence the ark which contained them is frequently called the ark
of the testimony; and the whole tabernacle in this place. The tabernacle
of the testimony - according to the model which he had seen - When he
was caught up in the visions of God on the mount.

[Acts 7:45](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#045.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_045">act 7:45</span></span>

Which our fathers having received - From their ancestors; brought into
the possession of the Gentiles - Into the land which the Gentiles
possessed before. So that God's favour is not a necessary consequence of
inhabiting this land. All along St. Stephen intimates two things: 1.
That God always loved good men in every land: 2. That he never loved bad
men even in this. [Jos 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/jos003.htm#014.md).

[Acts 7:46](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#046.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_046">act 7:46</span></span>

Who petitioned to find a habitation for the God of Jacob - But he did
not obtain his petition: for God remained without any temple till
Solomon built him a house. Observe how wisely the word is chosen with
respect to what follows.

[Acts 7:48](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#048.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_048">act 7:48</span></span>

Yet the Most High inhabiteth not temples made with hands - As Solomon
declared at the very dedication of the temple, [Kg1
8:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#027.md). The Most High - Whom as such no
building can contain. [Isa 66:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#001.md).

[Acts 7:49](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#049.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_049">act 7:49</span></span>

What is the place of my rest? - Have I need to rest?

[Acts 7:51](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#051.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_051">act 7:51</span></span>

Ye stiff necked - Not bowing the neck to God's yoke; and uncircumcised
in heart - So they showed themselves, [Act
7:54](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#054.md); and ears - As they showed, [Act
7:57](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#057.md). So far were they from receiving
the word of God into their hearts, that they would not hear it even with
their ears. Ye - And your fathers, always - As often as ever ye are
called, resist the Holy Ghost - Testifying by the prophets of Jesus, and
the whole truth. This is the sum of what he had shown at large.

[Acts 7:53](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#053.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_053">act 7:53</span></span>

Who have received the law by the administration of angels - God, when he
gave the law on Mount Sinai, was attended with thousands of his angels,
[Gal 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#019.md); [Psa
68:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#017.md).

[Acts 7:55](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#055.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_055">act 7:55</span></span>

But he looking steadfastly up to heaven, saw the glory of God -
Doubtless he saw such a glorious representation, God miraculously
operating on his imagination, as on Ezekiel's, when he sat in his house
at Babylon, and saw Jerusalem, and seemed to himself transported
thither, [Eze 8:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#001.md). And probably
other martyrs, when called to suffer the last extremity, have had
extraordinary assistance of some similar kind.

[Acts 7:56](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#056.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_056">act 7:56</span></span>

I see the Son of man standing - As if it were just ready to receive him.
Otherwise he is said to sit at the right hand of God.

[Acts 7:57](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#057.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_057">act 7:57</span></span>

They rushed upon him - Before any sentence passed.

[Acts 7:58](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#058.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_058">act 7:58</span></span>

The witnesses laid down their clothes at the feet of a young man, whose
name was Saul - O Saul, couldst thou have believed, if one had told
thee, that thou thyself shouldst be stoned in the same cause? and
shouldst triumph in committing thy soul likewise to that Jesus whom thou
art now blaspheming? His dying prayer reached thee, as well as many
others. And the martyr Stephen, and Saul the persecutor, (afterward his
brother both in faith and martyrdom,) are now joined in everlasting
friendship, and dwell together in the happy company of those who have
made their robes white in the blood of the Lamb.

[Acts 7:59](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#059.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_059">act 7:59</span></span>

And they stoned Stephen, invoking and saying, Lord Jesus, receive my
spirit - This is the literal translation of the words, the name of God
not being in the original. Nevertheless such a solemn prayer to Christ,
in which a departing soul is thus committed into his hands, is such an
act of worship, as no good man could have paid to a mere creature;
Stephen here worshipping Christ in the very same manner in which Christ
worshipped the Father on the cross.
