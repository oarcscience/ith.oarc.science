### [Micah Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#001)

[Micah 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mic 7:1</span></span>

Woe is me - The land is brought in complaining, that whereas it was once
well stored, now it hath few good in it. As the grape - gleanings - In
Israel and Judah, which in bringing forth good men, should have been a
fruitful vine full of clusters: just, compassionate and humble men, are
as grapes after the vintage is gathered. Desired - But in vain.

[Micah 7:3](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">mic 7:3</span></span>

Both hands - With all diligence. The great man - The great man at court,
who can do what he will there. Uttereth - Is bold to speak plainly.
Desire - His unjust, oppressive design. They - They all jointly promote
violence and cruelty.

[Micah 7:4](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">mic 7:4</span></span>

As a briar - Mischievous and hurtful. The day - The day in which they
shall sound the alarm. Cometh - Surely, speedily, and unavoidably. Now -
When that day is come.

[Micah 7:7](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">mic 7:7</span></span>

Therefore - Since all sorts of men are so perfidious. Look - As one set
in a watch - tower looks round about, and diligently observes all that
stirs, so will the prophet; so did they who in Israel and Judah feared
the Lord.

[Micah 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">mic 7:8</span></span>

Rejoice not - The prophet personates the church. Let it be no matter of
glorying to thee, that the day of calamity hath overtaken me. In
darkness - When affliction, war, famine, and captivity cover me. A light
- Shall support, comfort and deliver me.

[Micah 7:9](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">mic 7:9</span></span>

Plead - Against mine enemy, now he pleads his own cause against me. His
righteousness - The truth and riches of his promised salvation.

[Micah 7:10](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">mic 7:10</span></span>

She - What nation or people soever. Shall behold - The people of God
shall see their enemies laid low.

[Micah 7:11](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">mic 7:11</span></span>

Thy walls - O Jerusalem. The decree - Of Artaxerxes, which forbad the re
- building of the temple. Removed - Abolished.

[Micah 7:12](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">mic 7:12</span></span>

In that day - After the return out of captivity. He - He who is of
Jewish race. To thee - O Jerusalem. The fortified cities - In which many
Jews were kept for servile works. To the river - To Euphrates. To sea -
From the Caspian to the Persian and to the Midland sea. From mountain -
That is, from all parts of their captivity, they shall return to their
own country.

[Micah 7:13](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">mic 7:13</span></span>

Not withstanding - These promises of restitution, which took not place
'till more than two hundred years after.

[Micah 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">mic 7:14</span></span>

Feed - So Christ directs his officers. With thy rod - In allusion to the
custom of shepherds who guided their sheep by a pastoral staff. In the
wood - Protect and guide those that in their present captive state are
solitary, compassed with dangers. Carmel - A fruitful place and well
inhabited. In Bashan - A place of note for fruitfulness. Gilead - Equal
with any of the other for plenty and safety.

[Micah 7:16](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">mic 7:16</span></span>

Shall be deaf - They shall neither care to hear, nor to speak of it.

[Micah 7:17](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">mic 7:17</span></span>

Lick the dust - In the most submissive, servile manner, testify their
subjection. Holes - Their strong holds, and fastnesses. Because of thee
- So that the name of Jews, shall be terrible to their enemies.
