### [Exodus Chapter 18](../../../bib/kjv/exo018.htm#001.md)

[Exodus 18:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo018.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">exo 18:1</span></span>

Jethro to congratulate the happiness of Israel, and particularly the
honour of Moses his son - in - law; comes to rejoice with them, as one
that had a true respect both for them and for their God. And also to
bring Moses's wife and children to him. It seems he had sent them back,
probably from the inn where his wife's lothness to have her son
circumcised had like to have cost him his life, [Exo
4:25](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#025.md).

[Exodus 18:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo018.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">exo 18:3</span></span>

The name of one was Gershom - A stranger, designing thereby not only a
memorial of his own condition, but a memorandum to this son of his, for
we are all strangers upon earth.

[Exodus 18:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo018.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">exo 18:4</span></span>

The name of the other was Eliezer - My God a help: it looks back to his
deliverance from Pharaoh, when he made his escape after the slaying of
the Egyptian; but if this were the son that was circumcised in the inn,
I would rather translate it, The Lord is mine help, and will deliver me
from the sword of Pharaoh, which he had reason to expect would be drawn
against him, when he was going to fetch Israel out of bondage.

[Exodus 18:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo018.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">exo 18:11</span></span>

Now know I that JEHOVAH is greater than all gods - That the God of
Israel is greater than all pretenders; all deities, that usurp divine
honours: he silenceth them, subdues them all, and is himself the only
living and true God. He is also higher than all princes and potentates,
who also are called gods, and has both an incontestable authority over
them, and an irresistible power to control them; he manages them all as
he pleaseth, and gets honour upon them how great soever they are. Now
know I: he knew it before, but now he knew it better; his faith grew up
to a full assurance, upon this fresh evidence; for wherein they dealt
proudly - The magicians or idols of Egypt, or Pharaoh and his grandees,
opposing God, and setting up in competition with him, he was above them.
The magicians were baffled, Pharaoh humbled, his powers broken, and
Israel rescued out of their hands.

[Exodus 18:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo018.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">exo 18:12</span></span>

And Jethro took a burnt offering for God - And probably offered it
himself, for he was a priest in Midian, and a worshipper of the true
God, and the priesthood was not yet settled in Israel. And they did eat
bread before God - Soberly, thankfully, in the fear of God; and their
talk such as became saints. Thus we must eat and drink to the glory of
God; as those that believe God's eye is upon us.

[Exodus 18:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo018.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">exo 18:13</span></span>

Moses sat to judge the people - To answer enquiries; to acquaint them
with the will of God in doubtful cases, and to explain the laws of God
that were already given.

[Exodus 18:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo018.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">exo 18:15</span></span>

The people came to enquire of God - And happy was it for them that they
had such an oracle to consult. Moses was faithful both to him that
appointed him, and to them that consulted him, and made them know the
statutes of God, and his laws - His business was not to make laws, but
to make known God's laws: his place was but that of a servant.

[Exodus 18:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo018.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">exo 18:16</span></span>

I judge between one and another - And if the people were as quarrelsome
one with another as they were with God, he had many causes brought
before him, and the more because their trials put them to no expence.

[Exodus 18:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo018.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">exo 18:17</span></span>

Not good - Not convenient either for thee or them.

[Exodus 18:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo018.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">exo 18:19</span></span>

Be thou for them to God - ward - That was an honour which it was not fit
any other should share with him in. Also whatever concerned the whole
congregation must pass through his hand, [Exo
18:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo018.htm#020.md). But, he appointed judges in the
several tribes and families, which should try causes between man and
man, and determine them, which would be done with less noise, and more
dispatch than in the general assembly. Those whose gifts and stations
are most eminent may yet be greatly furthered in their work by the
assistance of those that are every way their inferiors. This is Jethro's
advice; but he adds two qualifications to his counsel. That great care
should be taken in the choice of the persons who should be admitted into
this trust; it was requisite that they should be men of the best
character. For judgment and resolution, able men: men of good sense,
that understood business; and bold men, that would not be daunted by
frowns or clamours. Clear heads and stout hearts make good judges. For
piety, such as fear God, who believe there is a God above them, whose
eye is upon them, to whom they are accountable, and whose judgment they
stand in awe of. Conscientious men, that dare not do an ill thing,
though they could do it never so secretly and securely. For honesty, men
of truth, whose word one may take, and whose fidelity one may rely upon.
For a generous contempt of worldly wealth, hating covetousness, not only
not seeking bribes, or aiming to enrich themselves, but abhorring the
thought of it. That he should attend God's direction in the case, [Exo
18:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo018.htm#023.md). If thou shalt do this thing,
and God command thee so - Jethro knew that Moses had a better counsellor
than he was, and to his counsel he refers him.

[Exodus 18:24](../../../bib/kjv/exo018.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">exo 18:24</span></span>

So Moses hearkened unto the voice of his father - in - law. When he came
to consider the thing, he saw the reasonableness of it, and resolved to
put it in practice, which he did soon after, when he had received
directions from God. Those are not so wise as they would be thought to
be, who think themselves too wise to be counselled; for a wise man will
hear, and will increase learning, and not slight good counsel, though
given by an inferior.

[Exodus 18:27](../../../bib/kjv/exo018.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">exo 18:27</span></span>

He went into his own land - It is supposed the Kenites mentioned [Sa1
15:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#006.md), were the posterity of Jethro,
(compare [Jdg 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#016),.md) and they are
taken under special protection, for the kindness their ancestor shewed
to Israel.
