### [Isaiah Chapter 35](../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah 35:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 35:1</span></span>

The solitary place - Emmanuel's land, or the seat of God's church and
people, which formerly was despised like a wilderness, and which the
rage of their enemies had brought to desolation, shall flourish
exceedingly.

[Isaiah 35:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">isa 35:2</span></span>

The excellency - The wilderness shall be as pleasant and fruitful as
Lebanon, and Carmel, and Sharon. They - The inhabitants of the
wilderness aforesaid. The glory - The glorious discoveries of God's
power and goodness.

[Isaiah 35:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 35:3</span></span>

Strengthen - Ye ministers of God, comfort and encourage God's people,
who are now ready to faint.

[Isaiah 35:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 35:4</span></span>

Your God - Tho' he seems to be departed, he will come to you, and abide
with you. He will shortly come in the flesh, to execute vengeance upon
the enemies of God.

[Isaiah 35:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 35:5</span></span>

Then - The poor Gentiles, who before were blind and deaf, shall now have
the eyes and ears of their minds opened to see God's works, and to hear
and receive his word.

[Isaiah 35:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">isa 35:7</span></span>

Streams - The most dry and barren places shall be made moist and
fruitful; which is principally meant of the plentiful effusion of God's
grace upon such persons and nations, as had been wholly destitute of it.
Rushes - Those dry and parched deserts, in which dragons have their
abode, shall yield abundance of grass, and reeds, and rushes, which grow
only in moist ground.

[Isaiah 35:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">isa 35:8</span></span>

A way - The high - way and the way are not to be taken for two different
ways, but for one and the same way, even a causey, which is raised
ground, and a way. Holiness - The people (walking in it) shall be all
righteous. For those - But this way shall be appropriated to those
persons above - mentioned; the weak, and blind, and lame, whom God will
lead and save. Though fools - The way shall be so plain and strait, that
even the most foolish travellers cannot easily mistake it.
