### [Galatians Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#001.md)

[Galatians 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">gal 4:1</span></span>

Now - To illustrate by a plain similitude the preeminence of the
Christian, over the legal, dispensation. The heir, as long as he is a
child - As he is under age. Differeth nothing from a servant - Not being
at liberty either to use or enjoy his estate. Though he be lord -
Proprietor of it all.

[Galatians 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">gal 4:2</span></span>

But is under tutors - As to his person. And stewards - As to his
substance.

[Galatians 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">gal 4:3</span></span>

So we - The church of God. When we were children - In our minority,
under the legal dispensation. Were in bondage - In a kind of servile
state. Under the elements of the world - Under the typical observances
of the law, which were like the first elements of grammar, the A B C of
children; and were of so gross a nature, as hardly to carry our thoughts
beyond this world.

[Galatians 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">gal 4:4</span></span>

But when the fulness of the time - Appointed by the Father, [Gal
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#002.md). Was come, God sent forth - From
his own bosom. His Son, miraculously made of the substance of a woman -
A virgin, without the concurrence of a man. Made under the law - Both
under the precept, and under the curse, of it.

[Galatians 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">gal 4:5</span></span>

To redeem those under the law - From the curse of it, and from that low,
servile state. That we - Jews who believe. Might receive the adoption -
All the privileges of adult sons.

[Galatians 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">gal 4:6</span></span>

And because ye - Gentiles who believe, are also thus made his adult
sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts
likewise, crying, Abba, Father - Enabling you to call upon God both with
the confidence, and the tempers, of dutiful children. The Hebrew and
Greek word are joined together, to express the joint cry of the Jews and
gentiles.

[Galatians 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">gal 4:7</span></span>

Wherefore thou - Who believest in Christ. Art no more a servant - Like
those who are under the law. But a son - Of mature age. And if a son,
then an heir of all the promises, and of the all - sufficient God
himself.

[Galatians 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">gal 4:8</span></span>

Indeed then when ye knew not God, ye served them that by nature - That
is, in reality. Are no gods - And so were under a far worse bondage than
even that of the Jews. For they did serve the true God, though in a low,
slavish manner.

[Galatians 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">gal 4:9</span></span>

But now being known of God - As his beloved children. How turn ye back
to the weak and poor elements - Weak, utterly unable to purge your
conscience from guilt, or to give that filial confidence in God. Poor -
incapable of enriching the soul with such holiness and happiness as ye
are heirs to. Ye desire to be again in bondage - Though of another kind;
now to these elements, as before to those idols.

[Galatians 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">gal 4:10</span></span>

Ye observe days - Jewish sabbaths. And months - New moons. And times -
As that of the passover, pentecost, and the feast of tabernacles. And
years - Annual solemnities. it does not mean sabbatic years. These were
not to be observed out of the land of Canaan.

[Galatians 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">gal 4:11</span></span>

The apostle here, dropping the argument, applies to the affections, [Gal
4:11-20](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#011.md), and humbles himself to the
Galatians, with an inexpressible tenderness.

[Galatians 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">gal 4:12</span></span>

Brethren, I beseech you, be as I am - Meet me in mutual love. For I am
as ye were - I still love you as affectionately as ye once loved me. Why
should I not? Ye have not injured me at all - I have received no
personal injury from you.

[Galatians 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">gal 4:13</span></span>

I preached to you, notwithstanding infirmity of the flesh - That is,
notwithstanding bodily weakness, and under great disadvantage from the
despicableness of my outward appearance.

[Galatians 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">gal 4:14</span></span>

And ye did not slight my temptation - That is, ye did not slight or
disdain me for my temptation, my "thorn in the flesh."

[Galatians 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">gal 4:15</span></span>

What was then the blessedness ye spake of - On which ye so congratulated
one another.

[Galatians 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">gal 4:17</span></span>

They - The judaizing teachers who are come among you. Zealously affect
you - Express an extraordinary regard for you. But not well - Their zeal
is not according to knowledge; neither have they a single eye to your
spiritual advantage. Yea, they would exclude you - From me and from the
blessings of the gospel. That ye might affect - Love and esteem them.

[Galatians 4:18](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">gal 4:18</span></span>

In a good thing - In what is really worthy our zeal. True zeal is only
fervent love.

[Galatians 4:19](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">gal 4:19</span></span>

My little children - He speaks as a parent, both with authority, and the
most tender sympathy, toward weak and sickly children. Of whom I travail
in birth again - As I did before, [Gal
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#013.md), in vehement pain, sorrow,
desire, prayer. Till Christ be formed in you - Till there be in you all
the mind that was in him.

[Galatians 4:20](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">gal 4:20</span></span>

I could wish to be present with you now - Particularly in this exigence.
And to change - Variously to attemper. My voice - He writes with much
softness; but he would speak with more. The voice may more easily be
varied according to the occasion than a letter can. For I stand in doubt
of you - So that I am at a loss how to speak at this distance.

[Galatians 4:21](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">gal 4:21</span></span>

Do ye not hear the law - Regard what it says.

[Galatians 4:22](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">gal 4:22</span></span>

[Gen 21:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#002.md), [Gen
21:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#009.md).

[Galatians 4:23](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">gal 4:23</span></span>

Was born after the flesh - In a natural way. By promise - Through that
supernatural strength which was given Abraham in consequence of the
promise.

[Galatians 4:24](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">gal 4:24</span></span>

Which things are an allegory - An allegory is a figurative speech,
wherein one thing is expressed, and another intended. For those two sons
are types of the two covenants. One covenant is that given from mount
Sinai, which beareth children to bondage - That is, all who are under
this, the Jewish covenant, are in bondage. Which covenant is typified by
Agar.

[Galatians 4:25](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">gal 4:25</span></span>

For this is mount Sinai in Arabia - That is, the type of mount Sinai.
And answereth to - Resembles Jerusalem that now is, and is in bondage -
Like Agar, both to the law and to the Romans.

[Galatians 4:26](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">gal 4:26</span></span>

But the other covenant is derived from Jerusalem that is above, which is
free - Like Sarah from all inward and outward bondage, and is the mother
of us all - That is, all who believe in Christ, are free citizens of the
New Jerusalem.

[Galatians 4:27](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">gal 4:27</span></span>

For it is written - Those words in the primary sense promise a
flourishing state to Judea, after its desolation by the Chaldeans.
Rejoice. thou barren, that bearest not - Ye heathen nations, who, like a
barren woman, were destitute, for many ages, of a seed to serve the
Lord. Break forth and cry aloud for joy, thou that, in former time,
travailedst not: for the desolate hath many more children than she that
hath an husband - For ye that were so long utterly desolate shall at
length bear more children than the Jewish church, which was of old
espoused to God. [Isa 54:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#001.md).

[Galatians 4:28](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">gal 4:28</span></span>

Now we - Who believe, whether Jews or Gentiles. Are children of the
promise - Not born in a natural way, but by the supernatural power of
God. And as such we are heirs of the promise made to believing Abraham.

[Galatians 4:29](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">gal 4:29</span></span>

But as then, he that was born after the flesh persecuted him that was
born after the Spirit, so it is now also - And so it will be in all ages
and nations to the end of the world.

[Galatians 4:30](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">gal 4:30</span></span>

But what saith the scripture - Showing the consequence of this. Cast out
the bondwoman and her son - Who mocked Isaac. In like manner will God
cast out all who seek to be justified by the law; especially if they
persecute them who are his children by faith. [Gen
21:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#010.md).

[Galatians 4:31](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">gal 4:31</span></span>

So then - To sum up all. We - Who believe. Are not children of the
bondwoman - Have nothing to do with the servile Mosaic dispensation. But
of the free - Being free from the curse and the bond of that law, and
from the power of sin and Satan.
