### [Zechariah Chapter 13](../../../bib/kjv/zac013.htm#001)

[Zechariah 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac013.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">zac 13:1</span></span>

A fountain - The blood of Christ. Opened - The spouse is to Christ a
fountain sealed, but Christ is to sinners a fountain opened. Inhabitants
of Jerusalem - The inhabitants of Jerusalem are all to whom the gospel
is preached. For uncleanness - For purging away all manner of sins and
uncleannesses.

[Zechariah 13:2](../../../bib/kjv/zac013.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">zac 13:2</span></span>

Cut off - I will utterly destroy idols and idolatry. The prophets - The
false prophets. The unclean spirit - The devil who sets the false
prophets to work.

[Zechariah 13:3](../../../bib/kjv/zac013.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">zac 13:3</span></span>

Prophesy - Falsely. His father - His dearest friends. Shall thrust him
through - That is, shall wound, shall chastise him with stripes that may
leave their marks behind.

[Zechariah 13:4](../../../bib/kjv/zac013.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">zac 13:4</span></span>

A rough garment - Such as the true prophets were wont to wear.

[Zechariah 13:6](../../../bib/kjv/zac013.htm#006)

With which I was wounded - To recover me from ruining myself and others
by imposture, see [Zac 13:3](../../../bib/kjv/zac013.htm#003).

[Zechariah 13:7](../../../bib/kjv/zac013.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">zac 13:7</span></span>

O sword - Afflictions, persecutions, and the cross. My shepherd - Who is
my faithful shepherd, and will lay down his life for my sheep. My fellow
- This speaks Christ; man with us, and God with his father, God - man in
one person. The shepherd - This great and good shepherd. Turn mine hand
- God will turn his hand in favour, and for protection will keep the
new, and weak disciples.

[Zechariah 13:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac013.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">zac 13:8</span></span>

Two parts - Not precisely two, but the greater part shall die a temporal
death, by the sword of Titus, or in eternal death under unbelief. The
third - A remnant, the lesser part, shall escape or be preserved.
