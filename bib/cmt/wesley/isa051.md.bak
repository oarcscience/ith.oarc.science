### [Isaiah Chapter 51](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah 51:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 51:1</span></span>

sprang.

[Isaiah 51:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">isa 51:2</span></span>

Him alone - To follow me to an unknown land: him only of all his
kindred. Increased - Into a vast multitude, when his condition was
desperate in the eye of reason. And therefore God can as easily raise
his church when they are in the most forlorn condition.

[Isaiah 51:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 51:3</span></span>

Therefore - For the sake of Abraham, and of that covenant which I made
with him. Garden - Flourishing as the garden of Eden.

[Isaiah 51:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 51:4</span></span>

My people - Ye Jews, whom I chose to be my peculiar people. A law - A
new law, even the doctrine of the gospel. Judgment - Judgment is here
the same thing with law, the word of God, or the evangelical doctrine,
of which he saith that he will make it to rest, that is settle and
establish it. The people - People of all nations.

[Isaiah 51:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 51:5</span></span>

My righteousness - My salvation, the redemption of all my people, Jews
and Gentiles, which is the effect of his righteousness, his justice,
faithfulness, or mercy. Is gone - Shall shortly go forth. Judge - Shall
subdue the Gentiles to my authority, and rule them by my word and
spirit. Isles - The remote countries shall expect this salvation from
me, and from me only.

[Isaiah 51:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 51:6</span></span>

The heavens - The heavens and earth shall pass away, in regard of their
present state, and properties, and use, as smoak is said to vanish, tho'
the substance of it be not destroyed.

[Isaiah 51:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">isa 51:7</span></span>

Know - That love and practise it.

[Isaiah 51:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">isa 51:8</span></span>

Like wool - Like a woollen garment, which is sooner corrupted by moths
or such creatures, than linen.

[Isaiah 51:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">isa 51:9</span></span>

Put on - Put forth thy strength. Rahab - Egypt, from its pride or
strength. The dragon - Pharaoh so called, [Psa
74:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#013.md).

[Isaiah 51:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">isa 51:11</span></span>

Therefore - This verse contains an answer to the prophet's prayer. I did
these great things, and I will do the like again. Joy - Like a crown of
glory.

[Isaiah 51:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">isa 51:13</span></span>

Where is the fury - Is it not all gone? He speaks of the thing as if it
were already done, because it should certainly and suddenly be done.

[Isaiah 51:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">isa 51:16</span></span>

I have - These words are spoken by God to his church and people, to whom
he speaks both in the foregoing and following verses. For God's word is
frequently said to be put into the mouths, not only of the prophets, but
of the people also. Covered - Have protected thee by my almighty power,
that I may bring thee to that perfect and blessed estate which is
reserved for the days of the Messiah, which in scripture phrase is
called a making of new heavens, and a new earth, [Isa
65:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#017.md).

[Isaiah 51:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">isa 51:17</span></span>

Awake - Heb. Rouse up thyself: come out of that forlorn condition in
which thou hast so long been. Stand up - Upon thy feet, O thou who hast
been thrown to the ground. Drunk - Who hast been sorely afflicted. The
cup - Which strikes him that drinks it with deadly horror. And wrung -
Drunk every drop of it.

[Isaiah 51:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">isa 51:18</span></span>

None to guide - When thou wast drunk with this cup, and not able to go.

[Isaiah 51:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">isa 51:19</span></span>

These things - Those which follow, which tho' expressed in four words,
may fitly be reduced to two things, the desolation or devastation of the
land, and the destruction of the people by famine and sword. So famine
and sword are not named as new evils, but only as the particular ways of
bringing the destruction. By whom - I cannot find any man who is able to
comfort and relieve thee.

[Isaiah 51:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">isa 51:20</span></span>

Fainted - They are so far from being able to comfort thee, that they
themselves faint away. They lie - Dead by famine or the sword. As a bull
- Those of them who are not slain are struggling for life.

[Isaiah 51:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">isa 51:21</span></span>

Not with wine - But with the cup of God's fury.

[Isaiah 51:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">isa 51:22</span></span>

That pleadeth - Who, tho' he has fought against thee, is now reconciled
to thee, and will maintain thy cause against all thine adversaries.

[Isaiah 51:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">isa 51:23</span></span>

Go over - That we may trample upon thee.
