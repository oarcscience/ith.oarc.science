### [Numbers Chapter 29](../../../bib/kjv/num029.htm#001)

[Numbers 29:6](../../../bib/kjv/num029.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">num 29:6</span></span>

Of the month - Belonging to every new moon.

[Numbers 29:7](../../../bib/kjv/num029.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">num 29:7</span></span>

Afflict your souls - Yourselves, by fasting and abstinence from all
delightful things, and by compunction for your sins, and the judgments
of God, either deserved by you or inflicted upon you.

[Numbers 29:12](../../../bib/kjv/num029.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">num 29:12</span></span>

Seven days - Not by abstaining so long from all servile work, but by
offering extraordinary sacrifices each day. This was the Feast of
Tabernacles. And all the days of their dwelling in booths, they must
offer sacrifices. While we are in these tabernacles, 'tis our interest
as well as duty, to keep up our communion with God. Nor will the
unsettledness of our outward condition, excuse our neglect of God's
worship.
