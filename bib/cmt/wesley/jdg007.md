### [Judges Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#001.md)

[Judges 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jdg 7:2</span></span>

Too many - For my purpose; which is, so to deliver Israel, that it may
appear to be my own act, that so I may have all the glory, and they may
be the more strongly obliged to serve me. This may help us to understand
those providences, which sometimes seem to weaken the church of Christ.
Its friends are too many, too mighty, too wise, for God to work
deliverance by. God is taking a course to lessen them, that he may be
exalted in his own strength.

[Judges 7:3](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jdg 7:3</span></span>

Mount Gilead - Not mount Gilead beyond Jordan; for both the camps of the
Israelites and the Midianites were on this side Jordan: but another
mount Gilead in the tribe of Manasseh. There returned - These finding
their whole army very small, in comparison of their enemies, who were a
hundred and thirty five thousand, [Jdg
8:10](../../../bib/kjv/jdg008.htm#010.md), and they, no doubt well armed
and disciplined, and encouraged by long success; whereas the Israelites
were dispirited with long servitude, and many of them unarmed, lost the
courage which they had at first.

[Judges 7:4](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jdg 7:4</span></span>

The water - Either that which ran from the well of Harod, mentioned [Jdg
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#001.md), or some other brook.

[Judges 7:6](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jdg 7:6</span></span>

That lapped - Taking up a little water in the palm of their hands.

[Judges 7:7](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jdg 7:7</span></span>

His own place - That is, to his own home. By this farther distinction it
was proved, that none should be made use of, but, Men that were hardy,
that could endure fatigue, without complaining of thirst or weariness:
Men that were hasty, that thought it long, 'till they were engaged with
the enemy, and so just wetted their mouth and away, not staying for a
full draught. Such as these God chuses to employ, that are not only well
affected, but zealously affected to his work.

[Judges 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jdg 7:8</span></span>

Their trumpets - That is the trumpets belonging to the whole army, which
he retained for the use following.

[Judges 7:9](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jdg 7:9</span></span>

The same night - After he had dismissed all but the three hundred. The
Lord said - In a dream or vision of the night.

[Judges 7:11](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jdg 7:11</span></span>

Thine hand strengthened - Thou wilt be encourage to proceed,
notwithstanding the smallness of thy number.

[Judges 7:13](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jdg 7:13</span></span>

A cake - A weak and contemptible thing; and in itself as unable to
overthrow a tent, as to remove a mountain; but being thrown by a divine
hand, it bore down all before it.

[Judges 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jdg 7:14</span></span>

His fellow answered, &c. - As there are many examples of significant
dreams, given by God to Heathens, so some of them had the gift of
interpreting dreams; which they sometimes did by divine direction as in
this case.

[Judges 7:15](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jdg 7:15</span></span>

He worshipped - He praised God for this special encouragement.

[Judges 7:16](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jdg 7:16</span></span>

Three companies - To make a shew of a vast army. Within the pitchers -
Partly to preserve the flame from the wind and weather; and partly to
conceal it, and surprise their enemy with sudden flashes of light.

[Judges 7:17](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jdg 7:17</span></span>

Look on me - For though two hundred of his men were placed on other
sides of the camp; yet they were so disposed, that some persons, set as
watchmen, might see what was done, and give notice to the rest to follow
the example.

[Judges 7:18](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jdg 7:18</span></span>

Of Gideon - He mentions his own name, together with God's, not out of
arrogance, as if he would equal himself with God; but from prudent
policy, because his name was grown formidable to them, and so was likely
to further his design. See [Jdg 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#014.md).

[Judges 7:19](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">jdg 7:19</span></span>

Middle watch - That is, of the second watch; for though afterward the
night was divided into four watches by the Romans, [Mat
14:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat014.htm#025.md), yet in more ancient times, and
in the eastern parts, it was divided into three: he chose the dark and
dead of the night, to increase their terror by the trumpets, whose sound
would then be loudest, and the lamps, whose light would then shine most
brightly, to surprise them, and conceal the smallness of their numbers.

[Judges 7:21](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">jdg 7:21</span></span>

They stood - As if they had been torch - bearers to the several
companies.

[Judges 7:22](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">jdg 7:22</span></span>

Against his fellow - They slew one another, because they suspected
treachery, and so fell upon those they first met with; which they might
more easily do, because they consisted of several nations, because the
darkness of the night made them unable to distinguish friends from foes,
because the suddenness of the thing struck them with horror and
amazement; and because God had infatuated them, as he had done many
others.

[Judges 7:24](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">jdg 7:24</span></span>

The waters - That is, the passes over those waters to which they are
like to come. Jordan - The fords of Jordan, which they must pass over
into their own country.

[Judges 7:25](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">jdg 7:25</span></span>

The other side of Jordan - For Gideon in the pursuit had passed over
Jordan. Oreb and Zeeb had probably taken shelter, the one in a rock, the
other by a wine - press. But the places of their shelter were made the
places of their slaughter, and the memory of it preserved in the names
of the places.
