### [Genesis Chapter 12](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#001.md)

[Genesis 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">gen 12:1</span></span>

We have here the call by which Abram was removed out of the land of his
nativity into the land of promise, which was designed both to try his
faith and obedience, and also to set him apart for God. The
circumstances of this call we may be somewhat helped to the knowledge
of, from Stephen's speech, [Act 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#002.md),
where we are told, That the God of glory appeared to him to give him
this call, appeared in such displays of his glory as left Abram no room
to doubt. God spake to him after in divers manners: but this first time,
when the correspondence was to be settled, he appeared to him as the God
of glory, and spake to him. That this call was given him in Mesopotamia,
before he dwelt in Charran, and in obedience to this call, he came out
of the land of the Chaldeans, and dwelt in Charran or Haran about five
years, and from thence, when his father was dead, by a fresh command, he
removed him into the land of Canaan. Some think Haran was in Chaldea,
and so was still a part of Abram's country; or he having staid there
five years, began to call it his country, and to take root there, till
God let him know this was not the place he was intended for. Get thee
out of thy country - Now, By this precept he was tried whether he loved
God better than he loved his native soil, and dearest friends, and
whether he could willingly leave all to go along with God. His country
was become idolatrous, his kindred and his father's house were a
constant temptation to him, and he could not continue with them without
danger of being infected by them; therefore get thee out, (Heb.) vade
tibi, get thee gone with all speed, escape for thy life, look not behind
thee. By this precept he was tried whether he could trust God farther
than he saw him, for he must leave his own country to go to a land that
God would shew him; he doth not say, 'tis a land that I will give thee
nor doth he tell him what land it was, or what kind of land; but he must
follow God with an implicit faith, and take God's word for it in the
general, though he had no particular securities given him, that he
should be no loser by leaving his country to follow God.

[Genesis 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">gen 12:2</span></span>

Here is added an encouraging promise, nay a complication of promises, I
will make of thee a great nation - When God took him from his own
people, he promised to make him the head of another people. This promise
was. A great relief to Abram's burden, for he had now no child. A great
trial to Abram's faith, for his wife had been long barren, so that if he
believe, it must be against hope, and his faith must build purely upon
that power which can out of stones raise up children unto Abraham. I
will bless thee - Either particularly with the blessing of fruitfulness,
as he had blessed Adam and Noah; or in general, I will bless thee with
all manner of blessings, both of the upper and nether springs: leave thy
father's house, and I will give thee a father's blessing, better than
that of thy progenitors. I will make thy name great - By deserting his
country he lost his name there: care not for that, (saith God) but trust
me, and I will make thee a greater name than ever thou couldst have had
there. Thou shalt be a blessing - That is, thy life shall be a blessing
to the places where thou shalt sojourn. I will bless them that bless
thee, and curse him that curseth thee - This made it a kind of league
offensive and defensive between God and Abram. Abram heartily espoused
God's cause, and here God promiseth to interest himself in his. In thee
shall all the families of the earth be blessed - This was the promise
that crowned all the rest, for it points at the Messiah, in whom all the
promises are yea and amen.

[Genesis 12:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">gen 12:4</span></span>

So Abram departed - He was not disobedient to the heavenly vision. His
obedience was speedy and without delay, submissive and without dispute.

[Genesis 12:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">gen 12:5</span></span>

They took with them the souls that they had gotten - That is, the
proselytes they had made, and persuaded to worship the true God, and to
go with them to Canaan; the souls which (as one of the Rabbins
expresseth it) they had gathered under the wings of the divine Majesty.

[Genesis 12:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">gen 12:6</span></span>

The Canaanite was then in the land - He found the country possessed by
Canaanites, who were likely to be but bad neighbours; and for ought
appears he could not have ground to pitch his tent on but by their
permission.

[Genesis 12:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">gen 12:7</span></span>

And the Lord appeared to Abram - Probably in a vision, and spoke to him
comfortable words; Unto thy seed will I give this land - No place or
condition can shut us out from God's gracious visits. Abram is a
sojourner, unsettled, among Canaanites, and yet here also he meets with
him that lives, and sees him. Enemies may part us and our tents, us and
our altars, but not us and our God.

[Genesis 12:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">gen 12:8</span></span>

And there he built an altar unto the Lord who appeared to him, and
called on the name of the Lord - Now consider this, As done upon a
special occasion when God appeared to him, then and there he built an
altar, with an eye to the God that appeared to him: thus he acknowledged
with thankfulness God's kindness to him in making him that gracious
visit and promise: and thus he testified his confidence in, and
dependence upon the word which God had spoken. As his constant practice,
whithersoever he removed. As soon as Abram was got to Canaan, though he
was but a stranger and sojourner there, yet he set up, and kept up, the
worship of God in his family; and wherever he had a tent, God had an
altar and that an altar sanctified by prayer.

[Genesis 12:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">gen 12:10</span></span>

And there was a famine in the land - Not only to punish the iniquity of
the Canaanites, but to exercise the faith of Abram. Now he was tried
whether he could trust the God that brought him to Canaan, to maintain
him there, and rejoice in him as the God of his salvation, when the fig
- tree did not blossom. And Abram went down into Egypt - See how wisely
God provides, that there should be plenty in one place, when there was
scarcity in another; that, as members of the great body, we may not say
to one another, I have no need of you.

[Genesis 12:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">gen 12:13</span></span>

Say thou art my sister - The grace Abram was most eminent for was faith,
and yet he thus fell through unbelief and distrust of the divine
Providence, even after God had appeared to him twice. Alas, What will
become of the willows, when the cedars are thus shaken

[Genesis 12:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">gen 12:17</span></span>

And the Lord plagued Pharaoh and his house - Probably, those princes
especially that had commended Sarai to Pharaoh. We are not told,
particularly, what these plagues were; but, doubtless, there was
something in the plagues themselves, or some explication added to them,
sufficient to convince them that it was for Sarai's sake they were thus
plagued.

[Genesis 12:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">gen 12:18</span></span>

What is this that thou hast done? - What an ill thing; how unbecoming a
wife and good man! Why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife? -
Intimating, that if he had known that, he would not have taken her. It
is a fault, too common among good people, to entertain suspicions of
others beyond what there is cause for. We have often found more of
virtue, honour, and conscience in some people, than we thought there
was; and it ought to be a pleasure to us to be thus disappointed, as
Abram was here, who found Pharaoh to be a better man than he expected.

[Genesis 12:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">gen 12:20</span></span>

And Pharaoh commanded his men concerning him - That is, he charged them
not to injure him in any thing. And he appointed them, when Abram was
disposed to return home, after the famine, to conduct him safe out of
the country, as his convoy.
