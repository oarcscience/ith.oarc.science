### [Zechariah Chapter 12](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#001)

[Zechariah 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">zac 12:2</span></span>

Jerusalem - That weak, unwalled city, and much more the church which is
the antitype of Jerusalem. In the siege - Now when all this is in
readiness, and no visible means of escape, then will God make them drink
the wine of astonishment.

[Zechariah 12:3](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">zac 12:3</span></span>

In that day - The day of the full accomplishment of this prophecy is a
day known to the Lord. A burdensome stone - Too heavy for them, though
many join together to remove it.

[Zechariah 12:4](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">zac 12:4</span></span>

I will open mine eyes - I will watch over my people for good. This eye
of God open upon his people, is his wise, powerful, gracious providence
for them. With blindness - All their warriors in their consults shall
have as little of foresight, as a blind man hath of sight.

[Zechariah 12:5](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">zac 12:5</span></span>

The inhabitants of Jerusalem - Though but few, and poor, yet they shall
be my strength. Not in their own power, but in the power of the Almighty
Lord of all.

[Zechariah 12:6](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">zac 12:6</span></span>

Like a hearth - A hearth on which fire is thoroughly kindled. In her own
place - Not built as Nineveh, Babylon, or Rome, in some place near old
cities, but in the very same place where old Jerusalem stood.

[Zechariah 12:7](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">zac 12:7</span></span>

The tents - The unfenced places, the open country, the cottages, or
tents. First - First the weaker are saved, next the stronger. The glory
- That the illustrious house of David, and the glorious citizens of
Jerusalem may not boast of their power, policy and courage.

[Zechariah 12:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">zac 12:8</span></span>

As David - A mighty man of valour. The house of David - Those of the
royal line shall be for prudence, and prowess in the conduct of the
armies of Israel, most excellent; exprest here in an hyperbole. As the
angel - Nay, like the angel of the Lord, like Christ who is captain of
our salvation.

[Zechariah 12:9](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">zac 12:9</span></span>

I will seek - I will purposely and effectually do it.

[Zechariah 12:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">zac 12:10</span></span>

I will pour - This was fulfilled on Christ's exaltation, when he sent
the Comforter to his disciples, it is daily performed to the children of
God, and will be continually, 'till we are brought to be with Christ for
ever. The house of David - The whole family of Christ, his house who was
the seed of David, and who is called David, [Eze
37:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#024). The spirit of grace - Which is
fountain of all graces in us. Pierced - Every one of us by our sins
pierced him, and many of the Jews literally. Mourn - They shall
literally lament the crucifying of the Lord Jesus. In bitterness - True
repentance will bitterly lament the sins which brought sorrows and shame
upon our Lord.

[Zechariah 12:11](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">zac 12:11</span></span>

In that day - When the Jews shall mourn for their sins, and for that
great sin, crucifying the Lord of glory. A great mourning - A mourning
exprest by the greatest the Jews ever were acquainted with, and which
for its greatness grew into a proverb. The mourning for Josiah slain at
Hadadrimmon, a town in the valley of Megiddo.

[Zechariah 12:12](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">zac 12:12</span></span>

The house of Nathan - The royal family in both branches of it, Solomon's
and Nathan's.

[Zechariah 12:13](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">zac 12:13</span></span>

The house of Levi - The sacerdotal tribe were the most bitter
persecutors of Christ, they hired the traitor, they sought witness; the
high priest, (head of that family) condemned him to die, for all which
they shall one day reckon with God, and therefore above other tribes
they are particularly named as chief mourners for their cruelty to
Christ.
